<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1171.</strong>“拉玛的儿子”同样表那些没有内在敬拜，但有对信的认知之人，他们的宗教信仰只在于具有这类认知；“示巴、底但”是指具有这些认知的民族，因为在内义上，这些民族表认知本身。这从以下先知书的经文，以及诗篇中有关西巴、示巴和拉玛的经文明显看出来，诗篇：<br />他施和海岛的王要进贡，示巴和西巴的王要献礼物；诸王都要叩拜祂。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗72.10.htm">72:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗72.11.htm">11</a>）<br />这论及主，祂的国和属天的教会。谁都能看出，“贡”和“礼物”在此表各种敬拜；但是，若不明白“他施和海岛”、“示巴和西巴”各是什么意思，就不知道这些敬拜属于哪种类型，以及它们的性质。前面已说明“他施和海岛”表与内在相应的外在敬拜。由此可知，“示巴和西巴”表内在敬拜，即“示巴”表敬拜的属天事物，“西巴”表敬拜的属灵事物。<br />以赛亚书：<br />我已经使埃及作你的赎价，使古实和西巴代替你。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛43.3.htm">43:3</a>）<br />此处，“古实和西巴”表信的属灵事物。同一先知书：<br />埃及劳碌得来的和古实的货物，身量高大的西巴人都必过来归你。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.14.htm">45:14</a>）<br />“埃及劳碌得来的”表知识，“古实的货物，身量高大的西巴人”表对属灵事物的认知，这些认知有助于人们信主。<br /><br />成群的骆驼并米甸和以法的独峰驼必遮满你；示巴的众人都必来到，要奉上黄金乳香，又要传说耶和华的赞美。基达的羊群都必聚集到你这里。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.6.htm">60:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.7.htm">7</a>）<br />此处，“示巴”用来表属天事物和衍生的属灵事物，它们被描述为“黄金乳香”；就象刚才所解释的，这些是“耶和华的赞美”，就是内在敬拜。<br />以西结书：<br />示巴和拉玛的商人与你交易，他们用各类上好的香料、各类的宝石和黄金兑换你的货物。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.22.htm">27:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.23.htm">23</a>）<br />这论及推罗。“示巴和拉玛”的意思从经上所说他们交易的货物清楚可知，即香料、宝石和黄金。“香料”的内义是仁爱，“宝石”的内义是源于仁之信，“黄金”的内义是对主的爱，所有这一切都是“示巴”所表示的属天事物。严格来说，“示巴”表对这些事物的认知，这就是为何他们在此被称为“商人”的原因，那些成为教会成员的人就被赋予这些认知，因为没有认知，没人能成为教会成员。<br />同样代表这类事物的还有，拜访所罗门，并给他带来香料、黄金和宝石的示巴女王（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上10.1.htm">10:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上10.3.htm">3</a>），还有耶稣出生时前来跪拜祂的东方智者，他们打开财宝，将黄金、乳香和没药献为礼物（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太2.1.htm">2:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太2.11.htm">11</a>）。这些礼物表属天、属灵和属世之善。耶利米书：<br />从示巴出的乳香，从远地出的甘蔗奉来给我有何益呢？你们的燔祭不蒙悦纳。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶6.20.htm">6:20</a>）<br />此处也很明显，“示巴”表认知和崇拜，也就是“乳香和甘蔗”所指的，但它们在此是指那些缺乏仁爱的事物，因而不蒙悦纳。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1171.</strong> The sons of Raamah also symbolize people who did not have inward worship but did have religious knowledge, the possession of which they considered to be religion; Sheba and Dedan are individual nations among whom that knowledge was extant, and at a deeper level they symbolize the knowledge itself. This can be seen from the following places in the prophets, beginning with quotations from them about Seba, Sheba, and Raamah. In David:<br />The monarchs of Tarshish and of the islands will bring a gift, and the monarchs of Sheba and Seba will deliver their tribute, and all monarchs will bow down to him. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1171/bible_king-james-version_psalms_72_10-11" target=_top>Psalms 72:10-11</a>)<br />This is about the Lord, his kingdom, and a heavenly type of church. The gift and tribute in this passage symbolize worship, as anyone can see, but no one can tell just who the worshipers are and what their worship is like without knowing what Tarshish and the islands mean, and what Sheba and Seba mean. Tarshish and the islands mean outward forms of worship that correspond to inner worship, as already demonstrated [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1171/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1156#subsection-2-2" target=_top>1156:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1171/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1158" target=_top>1158</a>]. As a result, Sheba and Seba mean inward forms of worship. Sheba, in particular, means heavenly aspects of worship, while Seba means spiritual aspects of it.<br />[2] In Isaiah:<br />I have given Egypt in atonement for you, Cush and Seba in place of you. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1171/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_43_3" target=_top>Isaiah 43:3</a>)<br />Cush and Seba stand for spiritual aspects of faith. In the same author:<br />The labor of Egypt, and the wares of Cush and of Seba's inhabitants — sizable men — will pass over to you. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1171/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_45_14" target=_top>Isaiah 45:14</a>)<br />The labor of Egypt stands for secular knowledge; the wares of Cush and of Seba's inhabitants, for a knowledge of spiritual entities. These serve a use to people who believe in the Lord.<br />[3] In the same author:<br />A troop of camels will blanket you, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; they will all come from Sheba. Gold and frankincense they will carry, and Jehovah's praises they will proclaim. Every flock of Arabia{*1} will be gathered to you. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1171/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_60_6-7" target=_top>Isaiah 60:6-7</a>)<br />In this passage, Sheba means heavenly qualities and the spiritual qualities that grow out of them. These are the gold and frankincense and are explained as being Jehovah's praises, or in other words, internal worship.<br />[4] In Ezekiel:<br />The dealers of Sheba and Raamah were your dealers, in the finest of every perfume, and in every precious stone; and gold they traded for your provisions. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1171/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_27_22-23" target=_top>Ezekiel 27:22-23</a>)<br />This is about Tyre. What Sheba and Raamah symbolize can be seen from the merchandise, which is listed as perfume, precious stones, and gold. On an inner level, perfume is charity, precious stones are the faith that charity yields, and gold is love for the Lord, all of which are the heavenly qualities that Sheba symbolizes. Strictly speaking, the knowledge of these qualities is Sheba, and that is why the passage describes them as different kinds of trade, which people are trained in when they are coming into the church. Without knowledge, no one can become part of the church.<br />[5] Something similar was represented by the queen of Sheba, who came to Solomon bringing perfumes, gold, and precious stones (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1171/bible_king-james-version_1-kings_10_1-2" target=_top>1 Kings 10:1-2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1171/bible_king-james-version_1-kings_10_3" target=_top>3</a>). The same is true for the sages from the East who came to Jesus at his birth, who fell down and worshiped him, and who opened their treasure chests and offered him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1171/bible_king-james-version_matthew_2_1" target=_top>Matthew 2:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1171/bible_king-james-version_matthew_2_11" target=_top>11</a>). These gifts symbolize heavenly, spiritual, and earthly types of goodness. In Jeremiah:<br />Why should frankincense come to me from Sheba, or the best calamus{*2} from a far-off land? Your burnt offerings give no satisfaction. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1171/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_6_20" target=_top>Jeremiah 6:20</a>)<br />Here too Sheba obviously symbolizes knowledge and acts of reverence, which are the frankincense and calamus; but in this case it is knowledge and reverence devoid of charity that Sheba symbolizes, and these are not pleasing.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} It is presumably because Seba, Sheba, and Raamah were located in Arabia that Swedenborg emphasizes the word "Arabia" here. [LHC]<br />{*2} Calamus is an aromatic essential oil of the sweet flag plant. It was used by the Israelites in the preparation of the holy anointing oil (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1171/bible_king-james-version_exodus_30_23" target=_top>Exodus 30:23</a>).

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1171</b></p><p><b>1171.</b>
That by "the sons of Raamah" are in like manner signified those who had no internal worship, but knowledges of faith, in the possession of which they made religion to consist; and that "Sheba and Dedan" 
are nations who had such knowledges; and that in the internal sense they signify the knowledges themselves, is evident from the following passages in the Prophets. Concerning Seba, Sheba, and Raamah, 
from these passages-in David: </p>
<p>     The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring gifts; the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer a present; yea, all kings shall bow themselves down unto Him (Ps. 
72:10-11). This is said concerning the Lord, His kingdom, and the celestial church. Anyone may see that here by "gifts" and "a present" are signified worships; but what these worships were, and of 
what quality, cannot be known unless it be understood what is meant by "Tarshish and the isles," and by "Sheba and Seba." It has been shown already that by "Tarshish and the isles" are meant external 
worships that correspond to internal. From this it follows that by "Sheba and Seba" are meant internal worships, namely, by "Sheba" celestial things of worship, and by "Seba" spiritual things of worship. 
 [2] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     I have given Egypt for thy ransom, Cush and Seba for thee (Isa. 43:3). "Cush and Seba" denote here the spiritual things of faith. In the same: </p>
<p>     The labor of Egypt, and 
the merchandise of Cush, and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee (Isa. 45:14). "The labor of Egypt" denotes the memory-knowledge, and "the merchandise of Cush and of the Sabeans," 
the knowledges of spiritual things, which are of service to those who believe in the Lord.  [3] In the same: </p>
<p>     The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah, 
all they from Sheba shall come; they shall bring gold and frankincense, and shall proclaim the praises of Jehovah. All the flocks of Arabia shall be gathered together unto thee (Isa. 60:6-7). By " Sheba" 
are here meant celestial things and the derivative spiritual ones, which are "gold and frankincense;" and it is explained that these are "the praises of Jehovah," that is, they are internal worship. 
 [4] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     The traders of Sheba and Raamah, these were thy traders in the chief of every spice, and in every precious stone, and they gave gold for thine aids (Ezek. 27:22-23). This 
is said of Tyre. What is signified here by "Sheba and Raamah" is evident from their merchandise, which is said to be spice, the precious stone, and gold. "Spice" in the internal sense is charity; "the 
precious stone" is faith from charity; and "gold" is love to the Lord, all which are celestial things signified by "Sheba." Properly the knowledges of such things are "Sheba" (and therefore they are 
here called "merchandise"), wherewith all who are becoming men of the church are imbued; for no one can become a man of the church without knowledges.  [5] Similar things were represented by the queen 
of Sheba, who came to Solomon and brought him spices, gold, and precious stones (1 Kings 10:1-3); and also by the wise men from the east who came to Jesus when He was born, and fell down and worshiped 
Him, and opening their treasures, they offered Him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh (Matt. 2:1, 11), by which was signified good, celestial, spiritual, and natural. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     To what 
purpose cometh there to Me frankincense from Sheba, and the sweet calamus from a far country? Your burnt-offerings are not acceptable (Jer. 6:20). Here too it is evident that by " Sheba" are signified 
knowledges and adorations, which are "incense" and "calamus;" but in this instance such as are devoid of charity, which are not grateful. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1171</b></p><p><b>1171.</b>
'The sons of Raamah' similarly means those who had no internal worship but cognitions of faith, in the mere possession of which they made religion consist; and 'Sheba and Dedan' are nations with whom 
they existed and by these same nations cognitions themselves are meant in the internal sense. This is evident from the places in the Prophets given below, and from the following in David concerning Seba, 
Sheba, and Raamah, </p>
<blockquote>
The kings of Tarshish and of the islands will bring a gift, and the kings of Sheba and Seba will offer a present; and all kings will fall down before Him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2072:10,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 72:10, 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This 
refers to the Lord, His kingdom, and the celestial Church. Anyone may see that here 'gift' and 'present' mean types of worship, though exactly which types of worship, and the nature of them, cannot 
be known unless it is known what 'Tarshish and the islands' and 'Sheba and Seba' are used to mean. The fact that 'Tarshish and the islands' is used to mean forms of external worship corresponding to 
internal has been shown already, from which it follows that 'Sheba and Seba' is used to mean forms of internal worship - 'Sheba' the celestial things of worship, and 'Seba' the spiritual. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In 
Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I gave Egypt as your expiation, Cush and Seba in place of you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2043:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 43:3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'Cush and Seba' stands for the spiritual things of faith. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The labour of Egypt, and 
the wares of Cush and of the Sabeans, men of stature, will come over to you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2045:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 45:14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The labour of Egypt' stands for knowledge, 'the wares of Cush and the Sabeans' for cognitions of spiritual 
things which serve people who believe in the Lord.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
A drove of camels will cover you, dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all those from Sheba will come. They will bring gold 
and frankincense and will proclaim the praises of Jehovah. The whole Rock of Arabia will be gathered to you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2060:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 60:6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'Sheba' is used to mean celestial things and the spiritual things 
deriving from these, described as 'gold and frankincense', which, as now explained, are 'the praises of Jehovah', that is, internal worship.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
The traders of Sheba and Raamah, they 
were your traders in the best of every spice, and in every precious stone, and they gave gold for your resources. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2027:22,%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 27:22, 23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Tyre. What 'Sheba and Raamah' means is clear from 
the commodities in which they are said to have traded - spices, precious stones, and gold. 'Spices' in the internal sense are charity, 'precious stones' are faith deriving from charity, and 'gold' is 
love to the Lord, all of which are the celestial things meant by 'Sheba'. Strictly, 'Sheba' means the cognitions of those things- and this is why they are here called 'merchandise' - with which those 
who become members of the Church are endowed, for without cognitions no one is able to become a member of the Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Similar things were represented by the Queen of Sheba who came to Solomon 
and brought him spices, gold, and precious stones, <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 10:1-3, and also by the wise men from the east who came to Jesus at His birth, and who fell down and worshipped Him, and who opened their treasures, 
and offered Him gifts, gold, frankincense, and myrrh, Matt. 2:1, <a href="11.htm">11</a>. These gifts meant celestial, spiritual, and natural good. In Jeremiah, </p>
<p>To what purpose does frankincense come to Me from 
Sheba, and best sweet cane from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable. Jer. 6:20. </p>
<p>Here also it is evident that 'Sheba' stands for cognitions and adoration, meant by 'frankincense 
and sweet cane', though here they are those things devoid of charity, which are not pleasing. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1171</b>

Quod per 'filios Raamae' similiter significentur illi qui internum cultum non habuerunt sed cognitiones fidei in quibus possidendis religionem posuerunt; et quod 'Sheba et Dedan' sint gentes apud quas 
fuerunt et quod in sensu interno per easdem significentur  ipsae  cognitiones,  patet  a  sequentibus  locis  apud Prophetas; ab his de Seba, Sheba et Raamah apud Davidem, Reges Tarshish et insularum

<p>ubi de Domino, Ipsius regno, et Ecclesia caelesti; quod hic per 'munus et honorarium' 
significentur cultus, quisque videre potest, sed quinam et quales cultus non sciri potest nisi sciatur quid per Tarshish et insulas, et per Shebam et Sebam intelligitur; quod per 'Tarshish et insulas' 
intelligantur cultus externi correspondentes interno, prius ostensum est, et quod per 'Shebam et Sebam' cultus interni, inde sequitur, nempe per 'Shebam' cultus caelestia, et per 'Sebam' cultus 
spiritualia:  apud Esaiam,  [2] Dedi expiationem tui Aegyptum, Cush et Sebam loco tui, xliii 3; </p>
<p>ubi 'Cush et Seba' pro spiritualibus fidei:  apud eundem, Labor Aegypti, et merces Cushi et Sebaeorum, 
viri mensurae ad te transibunt, xlv 14; </p>
<p>'labor Aegypti' pro scientia, 'merces Cushi et Sebaeorum' pro cognitionibus spiritualium quae inserviunt illis qui credunt in Dominum:  apud eundem, [3] Turma 
camelorum obteget te, dromades Midianis et Ephae; omnes e Sheba venient, aurum et tus portabunt; et laudes Jehovae annuntiabunt; omnis grex Arabiae congregabuntur tibi, lx 6, 7; </p>
<p>ubi per 'Shebam' 
intelliguntur caelestia et spiritualia inde, quae sunt 'aurum et tus,' et explicantur quod sint 'laudes Jehovae,' hoc est, cultus internus; apud Ezechielem, [4] Negotiatores Shebae et Raamae, hi negotiatores 
tui in primario omnis aromatis, et in omni lapide pretioso, et aurum dederunt subsidiis tuis, xxvii 22, 23; </p>
<p>de Tyro, ubi quid per 'Shebam et Raamam' significatur, constat ex negotiatione, quae 
dicitur aroma, lapis pretiosus, et aurum; 'aroma' in sensu interno est charitas, 'lapis pretiosus' est fides inde, 'aurum' est amor in Dominum, quae omnia sunt caelestia per 'Shebam' significata; 
talium cognitiones proprie sunt 'Sheba,' quare hic appellantur 'negotiationes,' quibus imbuuntur qui fiunt homines Ecclesiae, nam absque cognitionibus nemo potest fieri homo Ecclesiae; similia repraesentata 
sunt per  Reginam Shebae, quae venit ad Salomonem, et illi apportavit aromata, aurum, et lapidem pretiosum, 1 Reg. x 1-3;  tum etiam per Sapientes ab oriente, qui venerunt ad Jesum cum natus, 
et procidebant et adorabant Ipsum, et aperiebant thesauros suos, et offerebant Ipsi dona, auram, tus, et myrrham, Matth. ii 1, 11; </p>
<p>per quae significatum bonum caeleste, spirituale, et naturale:  apud 
Jeremiam, Quid Mihi tus e Sheba veniat, et calamus optimus e terra longinqua?  holocausta vestra non ad complacentiam, vi 20; </p>
<p>hic etiam patet quod per 'Shebam' significentur cognitiones et adorationes, 
quae sunt 'tus et calamus,' sed hic quae sunt absque charitate, quae non gratae. </p>
