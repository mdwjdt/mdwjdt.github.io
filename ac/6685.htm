<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6685节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6685.</strong>“她们很有活力”表它们有属灵生命在里面。这从“活力”的含义清楚可知，“活力”是指属灵生命（参看<a href="5890.htm">5890</a>节），在此是指教会事物里面的属灵生命，由“希伯来妇人”来表示。前面已反复阐明何为属灵生命，但由于如今很少有人知道何为属灵层，故在此进一步予以简要解释。就其最初源头而言，属灵层，就是从主的神性人身发出的神性真理。这真理拥有神性良善在里面，因为神性真理来自主的神性人身，也就是神性良善。这拥有神性良善在里面的神性真理就是源头上的属灵层本身，是充满天堂，事实上充满宇宙的生命本身；哪里有一个主体（主体在此是指某个真实存在的事物，然而该事物存在依赖于先于它自身的其它某个事物），它就流入哪里；但它在各个主体里面是不同的，取决于这个主体所取的形式。在与良善一致的主体里面，它建立属灵生命；但在与良善不一致的主体里面，它建立属灵生命的对立面，这对立面在圣言中被称为“死”。由此可见何为属灵生命，即它拥有从主发出、植根于良善的真理。</p>

For they are living. That this signifies that spiritual life is in them, is evident from the signification of "living," as being spiritual life (see n. 5890), here spiritual life in the things of the 
church, which are signified by "Hebrew women." What spiritual life is, has been repeatedly told above, but because few at this day know what the spiritual is, it may here be briefly explained further. 
The spiritual in its first origin is the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord's Divine Human; which truth has in it Divine good, because the Divine truth comes forth from the Lord's Divine Human, which 
is Divine good. The Divine truth, in which is Divine good, is the spiritual itself in its origin, and is the life itself which fills heaven, nay, which fills the universe; and where there is a subject, 
there it flows in. But in its subjects it is varied according to their form. In the subjects which agree with good, it presents spiritual life; but in the subjects which disagree with good, it 
presents life opposed to spiritual life, which in the Word is called "death." From this it is now plain what spiritual life is, namely, that it is to be in truths from good, which proceed from the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6685</b></p><p><b>6685.</b>
'For they are full of life' means that it has spiritual life within it. This is clear from the meaning of 'having life' as spiritual life, dealt with in <a href="5890.htm">5890</a>, in this instance spiritual life within things 
belonging to the Church, which are meant by 'the Hebrew women'. What spiritual life is has been stated a number of times already; but since few at the present day know what the spiritual is, let 
a further brief explanation be given of what this is. In its first origin the spiritual is Divine Truth emanating from the Lord's Divine Human. That Truth has Divine Good within it, because Divine Truth 
comes from the Lord's Divine Human, which is Divine Good. This Divine Truth which has Divine Good within it is the spiritual itself in origin, and is the actual life that fills heaven, indeed that 
fills all creation. Where there is a subject,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> there it flows in; yet it is different within each subject, depending on the form the subject takes. Within subjects in harmony with good it establishes 
spiritual life, but within subjects out of harmony with good it establishes the opposite of spiritual life, which in the Word is called 'death'. From this one may now see what spiritual life is, namely 
being in possession of truths rooted in good which come from the Lord.

`Quia viventes illae': quod significet quod in illis vita spiritualis, constat ex significatione `vivere' quod sit vita spiritualis, de qua n. 5890, hic vita spiritualis in illis quae Ecclesiae, quae 
significantur per `mulieres Hebraeas.'  Quid vita spiritualis, aliquoties prius dictum est, sed quia hodie quid spirituale pauci sciunt, licet adhuc paucis exponere (x)quid sit: spirituale in sua prima 
origine est Divinum Verum procedens a Divino Humano Domini, quod (d)Verum in se habet Divinum Bonum, quia Divinum Verum exit {1}a Divino Humano Domini, Quod est Divinum Bonum'; Divinum illud Verum, 
in quo Divinum Bonum, est ipsum spirituale in sua origine, et est ipsa vita quae implet caelum, immo quae implet universum; et ubi est subjectum, ibi influit; sed in subjectis variatur secundum formam; 
in subjectis quae concordant cum bono, ibi sistit vitam spiritualem; at in subjectis quae discordant a bono, ibi (x)sistit vitam contrariam vitae spirituali, quae in Verbo appellatur `mors'; inde nunc 
patet quid vita spiritualis, quod nempe sit esse in veris a bono quae a Domino procedunt. 	@1 e Divino Bono$ </p>
