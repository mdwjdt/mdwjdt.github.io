<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1185节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1185.</strong>“从那陆地出来往亚述去”表具有这类外在敬拜的人开始推理敬拜的内在。这从稍后有关“亚述”含义的论述清楚可知，在圣言中，“亚述”表理性和推理。本节可用两种不同的方式来读，也就是说，“亚述从那陆地出来”或“宁录从那陆地出来往亚述去”。之所以如此表述，是因为所表示的是两个观点：对属灵和属天事物的推理是由这类敬拜产生的，这是“亚述从示拿地出来”所表示的；这类敬拜推理有关属灵和属天的事物，这是“宁录从那陆地出来往亚述去”所表示的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1185.</strong> From that same land, Asshur went out, means that those who practiced this shallow kind of worship started to reason falsely about the deeper qualities of devotion. This is indicated by Asshur's symbolism in the Word as true reason and skewed reasoning, to be discussed just below.<br />Two meanings can be discerned here. One is that Asshur went out from that land; the other is that Nimrod went out from that land into Asshur, or Assyria.{*1} It is put this way because both ideas are meant — both that faulty reasoning about spiritual and heavenly matters sprang from this culture (which is Asshur's setting out from the land of Shinar) and that this kind of culture engages in faulty reasoning concerning spiritual and heavenly matters (which is Nimrod's setting out from the land into Asshur, or Assyria).<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Both of the meanings Swedenborg gives are legitimate interpretations of the Hebrew (מִן-הָאָרֶץ‭ ‬הַהִוא‭ ‬יָצָא‭ ‬אַשּׁוּר [min-hā'āreṣ hahî yāṣā 'Aššûr]). The ambiguity arises because Asshur, as a representative of Assyria, and the land of Assyria itself are both represented by one word in Hebrew (אַשּׁוּר ['Aššûr]). [LHC] </p>

Out of that land went forth Asshur.* That this signifies that they who were in such external worship began to reason about the internals of worship, may be seen from the signification of "Asshur" in 
the Word, as being reason and reasoning, concerning which in what presently follows. There is a twofold meaning in these words, namely, that Asshur went forth out of that land, and that Nimrod went forth 
from that land into Asshur, or Assyria. It is so expressed because both are signified, namely, that reasoning concerning spiritual and celestial things arises from such worship-which is that Asshur 
went forth out of the land of Shinar-and that such worship reasons about spiritual and celestial things-which is that Nimrod went forth from that land into Asshur, or Assyria. * Or, he went forth into Assyria. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1185</b></p><p><b>1185.</b>
That 'out of that land went Asshur' means that those with whom such external worship existed started to engage in reasoning about the internal aspects of worship becomes clear from the meaning of 'Asshur' 
in the Word as reason and reasoning, to be dealt with immediately below. This verse can be read in two different ways- that is to say, 'Asshur went out of that land' or 'Nineveh went out of that 
land into Asshur (or Assyria)'. It is worded in this way because both ideas are meant, both the idea that reasoning concerning spiritual and celestial things is the outcome of such worship, meant by 
Asshur's going out of the land of Shinar, and also the idea that such worship engages in reasoning concerning spiritual and celestial things, meant by Nimrod's going out of the land into Asshur or Assyria. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1185</b>
</p><b>1185.</b>
Quod 'e terra ista egressus est Asshur' significet quod illi qui in tali cultu externo fuerunt, coeperint ratiocinari de internis cultus, constare potest ex significatione Asshuris in Verbo quod sit 
ratio et ratiocinatio, de qua in mox sequentibus:  {1}duplex hic sensus apparet, nempe quod 'Asshur ex terra ista egressus,' tum quod 'Nimrod ex terra ista egressus in Asshur seu Assyriam'; ita dictum 
quia utrumque significatur, tam scilicet quod ratiocinatio de spiritualibus et caelestibus ex tali cultu existat, hoc est, quod Asshur egressus e terra Shinar, quam quod talis cultus ratiocinetur de 
spiritualibus et caelestibus, hoc est, quod Nimrod egressus e terra in Asshurem seu Assyriam. @'Thus A.V. has 'Out of that land went forth Asshur,' but R.V. has 'Out of that land he went forth to Assyria,' 
with former reading in m.$ </p>
