<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6482节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6482.</strong>我曾与灵人谈论主的总体治理，说，总体之物离了具体细节永远不可能存在；没有这些细节，总体之物什么都不是。事实上，之所以用“总体”一词，是因为它的具体细节合在一起就被称为“总体”，正如具体部分合在一起就被称为一个总的整体一样。因此，说圣治或天命以一种总体的方式，而非以具体的方式行动，等于什么都没说。如果有人将以一种总体方式行动的圣治或天命理解为，按照自然界在最初被造时就铭刻在它上面的一种秩序而对整个自然界的维护，那么他就不会想到，无物能持续存在，除非它不断存在；因为如学术界众所周知的，持续存在就是不断存在，因而维护就是不断创造。所以，圣治或天命始终存在于细节中。有些人确认以下观念：从国王的情况来看，总体之物离了具体细节也能存在；因为国王只是总体上掌控他的王国，并不负责具体细节。但这些人没有考虑到，王权不仅在国王本人那里，也在他的大臣那里；大臣们代表他履行他无法亲自履行的各种职责。国王的总体统治以这种方式存在于管理的具体细节中。但主无需这样；因为凡在祂里面的事物都是无限的，因为它是神性。天使担任祂的大臣，是为了让他们能有一种积极的生活，并由此获得幸福；然而，他们作为主的大臣所履行的职责并非来自他们自己，而是来自从主而来的流注；这也是众天使一致承认的。</p>

I have spoken with spirits about the universal government of the Lord-that what is universal is impossible without its singulars, and that without these what is universal is nothing; for it is called 
universal because its singulars taken together are so called, just as particulars when taken together are called a general; and therefore to say that there is Providence in the universal and not in the 
singulars, is to say nothing. If anyone by Providence in the universal understands the preservation of the whole according to an order impressed on universal nature at its first creation, he does not 
consider that nothing can subsist unless it perpetually comes into existence; for, as is known in the learned world, subsistence is a perpetual coming into existence, thus preservation is perpetual 
creation; consequently providence is constantly in the details. Some confirm themselves in the persuasion that what is universal may exist without what is particular, from the case of a king, who rules 
only universally, and not in every detail; but they do not consider that the royalty is not only with the king himself, but also with his ministers, who are his vice-regents in things where he himself 
is not able to act; it is in this way that the universal which is of the king is in all the details. But with the Lord there is no need of this; for whatever is in Him is infinite, because Divine. 
The reason why the angels are His ministers is in order that they may be in active life, and thence in happiness; nevertheless the ministries which they discharge are not from them, but from influx from 
the Lord, as also the angels unanimously confess. </p>

I have spoken to spirits about the Lord's exercise of government in an overall manner, saying that what is overall can never exist without specific aspects, and that but for these the overall is nothing; 
for the reason why the expression 'overall' is used is that this is what the specific aspects considered all together are called, just as particular parts taken all together are referred to as the 
general whole. To speak therefore of Providence acting in an overall manner but not in specific ways amounts to saying nothing at all. If anyone takes Providence acting in an overall manner to mean 
the general preservation of the whole natural world in line with the order stamped on it when it was first created, he does not take into account the consideration that nothing can remain in being unless 
it is constantly being brought into being; for as is well known in the learned world, remaining in being is a constant coming into being, and preservation is accordingly constant creation. Consequently 
Providence is present all the time in specific situations. Some people find confirmation of the idea that what is overall can exist without specific aspects in the role of a king, who exercises 
overall control of his kingdom but does not take charge of the details. But these people give no thought to the idea that royal power rests not only with the king himself but also with his ministers who, 
acting on his behalf, discharge the kinds of duties which he himself cannot possibly attend to. Thus the overall rule of the king exists within specific acts of government. But with the Lord there 
is no need of anything like this; for whatever exists in Him is infinite because it is Divine. Angels do serve as His ministers, so that they may have an active life, and from this derive happiness; 
nevertheless the duties they perform as His ministers are not initiated by themselves but by influx from the Lord, as the angels also confess with one accord. </p>

</p><b>6482.</b>
Locutus sum cum spiritibus de regimine Domini universali, quod universale nusquam dabile sit absque singularibus, et quod universale alioquin nihil sit, nam quod universale dicatur, est quia singularia 
simul ita appellantur, sicut particularia simul sumpta vocantur commune; idcirco dicere Providentiam in universali et non in singularibus, est nihil dicere.  Si quis per Providentiam in universali 
intelligit conservationem totius secundum ordinem universae naturae in prima creatione impressum ille non considerat quod nihil subsistere possit nisi (x)perpetuo existat, nam sicut notum est in orbe 
erudito, subsistentia est perpetua existentia, ita est conservatio perpetua creatio; consequenter est Providentia jugiter in singulis.  Confirmant se quidam in eo quod universale detur absque {1}particulari 
ex rege, qui universaliter regit non autem singulariter; sed illi non cogitant quod regium (t)non sit modo apud ipsum regem, sed etiam apud ejus ministros, qui vice ejus funguntur in talibus in 
quibus ipse non valet nec potest; ita universale quod est regis, est in singularibus{2}.  Sed hoc non opus est apud Dominum; nam quicquid in Ipso est, infinitum est, quia Divinum; quod angeli {3}Ipsius 
ministeria sint, est ut in vita activa sint, ac inde in felicitate; sed usque ministeria quae agunt, non sunt ex illis, sed ex influxu a Domino, quod quoque angeli unanimiter fatentur. @1 singulari$ @2 
i alioquin non foret regimen sed confusum chaos $ @3 i in caelo$ </p>
