<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3392节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3392.</strong>“见以撒和他的妻子利百加戏笑”表神圣良善存在于神圣真理中，或神圣良善与神圣真理联结。这从“以撒”和“利百加”的代表，以及“笑”的含义清楚可知：“以撒”是指主理性的神圣良善（<a href="3012.htm">3012</a>，<a href="3194.htm">3194</a>，<a href="3210.htm">3210</a>节）；“笑”是指对真理的爱或情感（<a href="2072.htm">2072</a>，<a href="2216.htm">2216</a>节）；“利百加”是指主理性的神圣真理（<a href="3012.htm">3012</a>，<a href="3013.htm">3013</a>，<a href="3077.htm">3077</a>节）。由此明显可知，“以撒和他的妻子利百加戏笑”表神圣良善与神圣真理同在。就整个思路而言，这些话的意思是：一开始，属灵真理被接受，是因为它被称为神性；后来则因为神性在它里面，那些正在重生并成为属灵教会成员的人清楚看到它。他们就是“亚比米勒”所表示的那些人，也就是那些拥有信之教义，并关注含有认知的真理之人，如刚才所述（<a href="3391.htm">3391</a>节）。</p>

And behold Isaac was laughing with Rebekah his woman. That this signifies that Divine good was present in Divine truth, or that Divine good was adjoined to Divine truth, is evident from the representation 
of Isaac, as being the Divine good of the Lord's rational (n. 3012, 3194, 3210); from the signification of "laughing," as being the love or affection of truth (n. 2072, 2216); and from the representation 
of Rebekah, as being the Divine truth of the Lord's rational (n. 3012, 3013, 3077). Hence it is evident that "Isaac laughing with Rebekah his woman" signifies that Divine good was present with 
Divine truth. The sense of the words in the series is that at first spiritual truth is received for the reason that it is called Divine; and afterwards because the Divine is in it, which is clearly 
seen by those who are being regenerated and are becoming men of the spiritual church. These are they who are meant by "Abimelech;" that is, who are in the doctrine of faith, and look to truths in knowledges 
(concerning whom just above, n. 3391). </p>

'And behold Isaac was laughing with Rebekah his wife' means that Divine Good was present within Divine Truth, that is, to Divine Good Divine Truth was allied. This is clear from the representation of 
'Isaac' as the Divine Good of the Lord's Rational, dealt with in <a href="3012.htm">3012</a>, <a href="3194.htm">3194</a>, <a href="3210.htm">3210</a>; from the meaning of 'laughing' as the love of truth or affection for it, dealt with in <a href="2072.htm">2072</a>, <a href="2216.htm">2216</a>; and from the representation 
of 'Rebekah' as the Divine Truth of the Lord's Rational, dealt with in <a href="3012.htm">3012</a>, <a href="3013.htm">3013</a>, <a href="3077.htm">3077</a>. From this it is evident that 'Isaac was laughing with Rebekah his wife' means that Divine Good was present 
together with Divine Truth. The meaning that these words have in the whole train of thought is that at first spiritual truth is received because it is called Divine, but that subsequently it is 
received because it holds within it that which is Divine and is clearly visible to those who are being regenerated and becoming members of the spiritual Church. These are the ones who are meant by 'Abimelech', 
that is, those who possess the doctrine of faith and have regard to the truths held within cognitions, dealt with just above in <a href="3391.htm">3391</a>. </p>

</p><b>3392.</b>
`Et ecce Jishak ridens cum Rebecca muliere sua': quod significet quod Divinum Bonum adesset in Divino Vero, seu quod {1}Divino Bono adjunctum Divino Vero esset, constat ex repraesentatione `Jishaki' 
quod sit Divinum Bonum Rationalis Domini, de qua n. 3012, 3194, 3210; ex significatione `ridere' quod sit amor seu affectio veri, de qua n. 2072, 2216; et ex repraesentatione `Rebeccae' quod sit Divinum 
Verum Rationalis Domini, de qua n. 3012, 3013, 3077; inde patet quod `Jishak ridens cum Rebecca muliere sua' significet quod Divinum Bonum cum Divino Vero adesset; sensus illorum in serie est quod 
verum spirituale recipiatur primum ex causa quia Divinum vocatur, postea quia in illo Divinum est, quod perspiciunt illi qui regenerantur et spiritualis Ecclesiae homines fiunt; hi sunt qui intelliguntur 
per `Abimelechum,' hoc est, illi qui in doctrina fidei sunt, et spectant vera in cognitionibus, de quibus mox supra n.3391.  @1 Divino Bono AI; but A has Divinum Veru deleted and i Divino Bono. 
 Probably the correct reading is Divino Bono adjunctum Divinum Verum esset.$  </p>
