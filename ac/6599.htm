<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6599节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6599.</strong>我可以通过经历来描述那些在感官层面进行思考的人，以及那些在高于感官的一个层面进行思考的人是什么情况，以及进入这两种人的流注是何性质。不过，首先要知道，人的思维是由不同且分开的观念构成的，一个观念接着另一个观念，就像说话时一句接着一句一样。然而，思维观念以如此快的速度彼此跟随，以致人在肉身期间，思维在他看来似乎是连续的，因而似乎没有任何间隔。但在来世，显而易见，思维被分成独立的观念；在那里，他们通过观念彼此交谈（参看<a href="2470.htm">2470</a>，<a href="2478.htm">2478</a>，<a href="2479.htm">2479</a>节）。现在，有必要说明思维及其观念是怎么回事，即：人的思维能传播到他周围的灵人和天使社群；他的理解和觉知能力就取决于进入这些社群的延伸，也就是取决于来自它们的流注。因此，去构成思维的一个观念包含无数事物，由观念构成的一个思维尤其包含无数事物。</p>

How the case is with those who think in the sensuous degree, and with those who think above this, and also what is the nature of the influx into the latter and into the former, I may state from experience. 
But first be it known that the thought of man is divided into ideas, and that one idea follows another, as one word follows another in speech. Yet the ideas of thought succeed each other so quickly 
that while he is in the body a man's thought appears to him as if it were continuous, and thus as if there were no division. But in the other life it is self-evident that the thought is divided into 
ideas; for speech is then effected by means of ideas (see n. 2470, 2478, 2479). It is now necessary to say how the case is with thought and its ideas, namely, that the thought diffuses itself into 
the societies of spirits and of angels round about, and that the capacity to understand and perceive is according to the extension into these societies, that is, according to the influx from them; and 
in the next place that there are countless things in one idea of thought, and still more in one thought composed of ideas. </p>

The situation with those who think on the level of the senses and with those who think on a level that of above the senses may now be described from experience, as may the nature of the influx into both 
kinds of people. But before that one should know that a person's thought consists of distinct and separate ideas and that one idea follows another just as one word follows another in speech. But the 
ideas constituting thought follow one another with such speed that thought seems to a person while he is in the body to be continuous, and therefore without any separate divisions. In the next life 
however it is plain to see that thought is distinguished into separate ideas, for there they talk to one another by means of ideas, <a href="2470.htm">2470</a>, <a href="2478.htm">2478</a>, <a href="2479.htm">2479</a>. Now the nature of the situation with thought and 
its constituent ideas must be stated: A person's thought spreads out into the communities of spirits and angels round about him, and his ability to understand and perceive is determined by its extension 
into them, that is, by the influx from them. As a consequence of this, one idea that goes to make up thought contains countless facets, and more especially so one thought composed of ideas. </p>

Quomodo se habet cum illis qui in sensuali cogitant et cum illis qui supra sensuale, et qualis influxus est in hos et in illos, licet {1} ab experientia tradere.  Sed prius sciendum quod cogitatio hominis 
distincta sit in ideas, et quod una idea sequatur alteram sicut una vox alteram in loquela; sed ideae cogitationis excipiunt una alteram tali celeritate ut cogitatio appareat homini cum in corpore 
est, sicut  {2}continua, ac ideo nulla distinctio; verum in altera vita se manifestat quod cogitatio in ideas distincta sit, loquela enim tunc fit per ideas, n. 2470, 2478, 2479.  Quomodo se habet 
cum cogitatione et ejus ideis, nunc dicendum est, nempe quod cogitatio se diffundat in societates spiritum et angelorum circumcirca, et quod facultas intelligendi et percipiendi sit secundum extensionem 
illuc, hoc est, secundum influxum inde; et deinde, quod in una idea cogitationis sint innumerabilia, et magis in una cogitatione ex ideis composita. @1 i nunc$ @2 continuum$ </p>
