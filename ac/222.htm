<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第222节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>222.</strong>对于“躲避耶和华的面”系指他们害怕内在的声音，正如有罪恶感的人所惧怕的，这从他们的回答可知——“我在园中听见你的声音，我就害怕。因为我赤身露体，我便藏了。”<br />“耶和华的面”，或“主的面”，系指慈悲、平安、良善，这从经中的祝祷文可知：“愿耶和华使他的脸光照你，赐恩给你。愿耶和华向你仰脸，赐你平安。”（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民6.25.htm">6:25</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民6.26.htm">26</a>）又如：“愿神怜悯我们，赐福与我们，用脸光照我们。”（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗67.1.htm">67:1</a>）再如：“有许多人说，谁能指示我们什么好处。耶和华啊，求你仰起脸来，光照我们。”（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗4.6.htm">4:6</a>）<br />主的慈悲也因此被称作“他面前的使者”：“我要照耶和华一切所赐给我们的，题起他的慈爱和美德，并他向以色列家所施的大恩，这恩是照他的怜恤和丰盛的慈爱赐给他们的。这样，他就作了他们的救主。他们在一切苦难中，他也同受苦难，并且他面前的使者拯救他们，他以慈爱和怜悯救赎他们。”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.7.htm">63:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.9.htm">9</a>）</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]222.</strong> Hiding themselves from Jehovah's face means fearing the inner dictate, as those who are conscious of their evil do. This meaning can be ascertained from their answer in verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_222/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_10" target=_top>10</a>: "I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked."<br />The face of Jehovah, or the Lord, is mercy, peace, and everything good, as is clear from the benediction<br />Jehovah make his face shine on you and have mercy on you. Jehovah lift his face on you and give you peace. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_222/bible_king-james-version_numbers_6_25-26" target=_top>Numbers 6:25-26</a>)<br />And in David:<br />May God have mercy on us and bless us; may he make his face shine on us. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_222/bible_king-james-version_psalms_67_1" target=_top>Psalms 67:1</a>)<br />And in another place:<br />Many people are saying, "Who will cause us to see good? Lift the light of your face on us, Jehovah." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_222/bible_king-james-version_psalms_4_6-7" target=_top>Psalms 4:6-7</a>)<br />This is why the Lord's mercy is called "the angel of his face" in Isaiah:<br />I will mention Jehovah's mercies. He repaid [the house of Israel] according to his mercies and according to the abundance of his mercies, and he became a savior to them. In all their anguish he was not an anguish, and the angel of his face saved them. On account of his love and on account of his compassion he redeemed them. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_222/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_63_7-8" target=_top>Isaiah 63:7-8</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_222/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_63_9" target=_top>9</a>) </p>

That to "hide themselves from the face of Jehovah" means to be afraid of the dictate, as is wont to be the case with those who are conscious of evil, is evident from the reply (verse 10): "I heard Thy 
voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked." The "face of Jehovah" or of the Lord, is mercy, peace, and every good, as is clearly evident from the benediction: </p>
<p>     Jehovah make His 
faces to shine upon thee, and be merciful unto thee; Jehovah lift up His faces upon thee, and give thee peace (Num. 6:25, 26). And in David: </p>
<p>     God be merciful unto us, and bless us, and cause His 
faces to shine upon us (Ps. 67:1). And in another place: </p>
<p>     There be many that say, Who will show us any good? Jehovah, lift Thou up the light of Thy faces upon us (Ps. 4:6). The mercy of the Lord 
is therefore called the "angel of faces" in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     I will make mention of the mercies of Jehovah; He hath requited them according to His mercies, and according to the multitude of His mercies 
and He became their Saviour. In all their affliction He was acted, and the angel of His faces saved them; in His love and in His pity He redeemed them (Isa. 63:7-9). </p>

'Hiding themselves from the face of Jehovah' is being afraid of this dictate, as people conscious of evil normally are. This is clear from their reply in verse to, 'I heard Your Voice in the garden and 
I was afraid because I was naked'. 'The face of Jehovah', that is, of the Lord, is mercy, peace, and all good, as is quite clear from the blessing,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah make His face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> shine upon you and be 
merciful to you. Jehovah lift up His face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> upon you and give you peace. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%206:15,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 6:15, 26</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And in David,  </p>
<blockquote>
God be merciful to us and bless us, and make His face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> shine upon us. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2067:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 67:1</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere 
in David,  </p>
<blockquote>
Many are saying, Who will cause us to see good? Lift up the light of Your face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> upon us, O Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%204:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 4:6, 7</a>.   
</blockquote>
The Lord's mercy is for this reason called 'the angel of His face'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> 
in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will cause the mercies of Jehovah to be remembered. He has rewarded them according to His mercies, and according to the abundance of His mercies; and He became their Saviour. In 
all their affliction there was no affliction, and the angel of His face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> saved them; in His love and in His pity He redeemed them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2063:7-9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 63:7-9</a>.

Quod 'occultare se a facie Jehovae' sit timere dictamen, sicut solent conscii mali, constat a responso eorum vers. 10 ubi haec, 'Vocem Tuam audivi in horto, et timui, quia nudus.' 'Facies Jehovae' seu 
Domini est misericordia, pax, et omne bonum, ut constat clare a benedictione, 	Lucere faciat Jehovah facies Suas ad te, et misereatur tui: elevet Jehovah facies Suas ad te, et ponat tibi pacem, Num. 
vi 25, 26: </p>
<p>et apud Davidem, 	Deus misereatur nostri, et benedicat nobis; lucere faciat facies Suas nobis, Ps. lxvii 2 [A.V. 1]: </p>
<p>et alibi, 	Multi dicentes, Quis videre nos faciet bonum? attolle 
super nos lucem facierum Tuarum, Jehovah, Ps. iv 7, 8 [A.V. 6, 7]: </p>
<p>misericordia Domini appellatur ideo angelus facierum, apud Esaiam, 	Misericordias Jehovae memorare faciam,...retribuit eis secundum 
misericordias Suas, et secundum multitudinem misericordiarum Suarum,...et factus iis in Salvatorem; in omni 	angustia eorum, {1}non angustia, et angelus facierum Ipsius salvavit eos, propter amorem 
Ipsius, et propter clementiam 	Ipsius Ipse redemit eos, lxiii 7-9. @	1 S. here translates the reading of Heb. text, in n. 6280 he has the Heb. marginal reading Ipsi angustia. See R.V. and the marginal note.$
