<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>620.</strong>“地”表前面提及的那个种族，这一点从前文有关“地”和“土地”含义的说明清楚可知。“地”这个术语在圣言中用得十分频繁；“陆地”表主的真正教会所在之地，如迦南“陆地”；也表没有教会的地方，如埃及“陆地”和外邦人的“陆地”。因此它指居住在那里的种族；由于它是指种族，所以它同样指那里的每个人。教会由于属天之爱而被称为“陆地”，如“迦南陆地”；由于污秽的爱被称为“外邦人的陆地”。然而，它由于播于其中的信而被称为“土地”。因为如前所述，陆地包含土地，土地包含田地，就象爱包含信，信包含被植入信的信之认知。此处“地”用来表示拥有属天之爱和教会的种族已经完全灭亡了。从主题就能知道它的属性。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]620.</strong> The symbolism of the land as the tribe of people mentioned earlier is established by places above that show the symbolism of the land (or earth) and the ground [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_620/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_268" target=_top>268</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_620/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566" target=_top>566</a>].<br />Land is a term that surfaces repeatedly in the Word, where it means an area — such as the land of Canaan — in which the Lord's true church exists. It also means an area — such as the land of Egypt or another non-Jewish nation — in which the church does not exist. Accordingly it stands for the race of people living there; and since it stands for the race, it also stands for every member of the race there.<br />An expression such as the land of Canaan uses the term land for a heavenly love. The lands of non-Jewish nations are so called on account of foul loves. But ground is used in reference to faith, which is planted as a seed. As I showed [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_620/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566#subsection-2-2" target=_top>566:2</a>], the land means the area surrounding the ground and the ground means the area surrounding a field, just as love is what contains faith and faith is what contains the religious knowledge that is planted.<br />The use of land in the current verse implies a race or tribe in which every element of heavenly love and of the church died away. (How a term applies [in a given context] can be determined from the subject under discussion.) </p>

That by the "earth" is signified the race which has been treated of before, is evident from what has already been told respecting the signification of "earth" and of "ground." The "earth"* is a term 
very often used in the Word; and by it is signified the "land" where the true church of the Lord is, as the "land" of Canaan; also a "land" where there is not a church, as the "land" of Egypt, and of 
the Gentiles. Thus it denotes the race that dwells there; and as it denotes the race, it denotes likewise everyone of the race who is there. The church is called the "land" from celestial love, as the 
"land of Canaan;" and the "land of the Gentiles" from impure loves. But it is called "ground" from faith which is implanted; for, as has been said, the land or country is the containant of the ground, 
and the ground is the containant of the field, just as love is the containant of faith, and faith is the containant of the knowledges of faith which are implanted. Here the "earth" is taken for a race 
in which everything of celestial love and of the church had perished. What is predicated is known from the subject. * The Latin word terra means both "earth" and "land." [Reviser.] </p>

That 'the earth'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> means that set of people dealt with already is clear from what has been shown concerning the meaning of 'the earth'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> which is used very often in the and 'the ground'. 'The land' is 
a term Word, and means the land where the Lord's true Church is, such as the land of Canaan. 'The land' may also mean where the Church is not, such as the land of Egypt, and the lands of the heathen nations, 
and so stands for the nation which inhabits the land. And since it stands for the nation, it also stands for any such individual who is there. It is called 'a land', for example, the land of Canaan, 
on account of heavenly love, and 'the lands of the heathen nations' are so called on account of loves that are foul. It is called 'ground' however on account of the faith sown in it. For, as has 
been shown, a land includes the ground, and the ground includes the field, just as love includes faith, and faith includes the cognitions of faith that are sown in it. Here 'the earth'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> stands for the 
people among whom heavenly love and the Church perished utterly. It is from the subject that one may know what is attributed to it.

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 620</b>
</p><b>620.</b>
Quod per 'terram' significetur gens illa, de qua prius, constat ex illis quae de significatione terrae et humi ostensa sunt.  Terra est vox, quae in Verbo saepissime nominatur, et per illam significatur 
terra ubi vera Ecclesia Domini, sicut terra Canaan; terra quoque ubi non Ecclesia, ut terra Aegypti, et gentium, ita pro gente quae ibi habitat; et quia pro gente, etiam pro unoquovis tali qui ibi: 
'terra' dicitur ex amore caelesti, ut terra Canaan; 'terrae gentium' ex amoribus spurcis; sed 'humus' ex fide quae inseminatur; nam, ut ostensum, terra est continens humi, et humus est continens agri, 
sicut amor est continens fidei, et fides est continens cognitionum fidei quae inseminantur: hic 'terra' sumitur pro gente, in qua omne amoris caelestis et Ecclesiae periit; ex subjecto noscitur quid 
praedicatur. </p>
