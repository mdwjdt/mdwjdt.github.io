<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3969节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3969.</strong>“说，神收拾了我的羞耻。就给他起名叫约瑟，说，愿耶和华再增添我一个儿子”在至高意义上表主的神性属灵层；在内在意义上表属灵国度，或信之良善；在外在意义上表得救，以及繁殖增多。这从圣言中“约瑟”的代表（如下文所述），以及“神收拾了我的羞耻”和“愿耶和华再增添我一个儿子”的含义清楚可知，因为“约瑟”这个名字源于动词“收拾”（gather up）和“增添”（add）。“神收拾了我的羞耻”表示拉结如今不再没有生育，因而不再“死了”，如她向雅各到论到自己那样（30:1，3908节）。因为“拉结”代表对内在真理的情感，或内层人的真理（<a href="3758.htm">3758</a>，<a href="3782.htm">3782</a>，<a href="3793.htm">3793</a>，<a href="3819.htm">3819</a>节）。若在良善与真理方面，外层人或属世人不与内层人相对应，可以说内层人在真理与良善上就是死的（参看<a href="3493.htm">3493</a>，<a href="3620.htm">3620</a>，<a href="3623.htm">3623</a>节）。它们必须彼此结合，以至于非为二，而是一起形成一个人。<br />这二者无法结合，直到属世人或外在人做好预备，也就是它接受并承认由雅各和利亚并使女所生的十个儿子所表示的一般真理，并且直到属世人的良善已在此人里面与真理结合，这种结合就由雅各与利亚所生的最后一个儿子，即西布伦来表示，他因“同住”而被如此称呼（<a href="3960.htm">3960</a>，<a href="3961.htm">3961</a>节）。这种结合实现后，内层人与外层人就进入前面所说的天上婚姻（<a href="3952.htm">3952</a>节）。它们之前并没有进入该婚姻的原因是一个极深的奥秘；因为在这种情况下，正是内层人的良善将自己联结于外层人的良善，并通过这外层良善联结于外层中的真理。同时，内层人的良善通过内层人中对真理的情感将自己联结于外层人的良善，并联结于那里的真理，从而将自己既直接又间接地联结起来（关于这种直接和间接的联结，可参看<a href="3314.htm">3314</a>，<a href="3573.htm">3573</a>，<a href="3616.htm">3616</a>节）。由于那时内层人先与外层联结，并且在这种联结产生之前，内层人似乎不存在，因而仿佛“死了”（如前所述），故经上说“神收拾了我的羞耻”。这就是经上所说神已“收拾”，也就是除去，意思是将她从中释放出来的“羞耻”所表示的。<br />不过，接下来的这句话，即“愿耶和华再增添我一个儿子”（约瑟由此而得名）则表示另一个奥秘，这个奥秘就是：“约瑟”代表主的属灵国度，因而代表属灵人，因为该国度就存在于每个属灵人里面。有两样事物构成属灵人，即仁与信；或也可说，良善与真理。信所源于的仁，或真理所源于的良善，就是那由约瑟来代表的事物。而拥有仁在里面的信，或拥有良善在里面的真理则是由另一个儿子来表示，并由便雅悯来代表的事物（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创35.16.htm">35:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创35.18.htm">18</a>论及便雅悯）。因此，“约瑟”表示属天-属灵之人，“便雅悯”则表示属灵-属天之人。这二者之间的区别的性质可从前面关于真理所源于的良善，并拥有良善在里面的真理的频繁论述看出来。这就是拉结第二句话，即“愿耶和华再增添我一个儿子”所表示的。不过，只有那些处于信之仁的人才能明白这些奥秘；因为就其内层而言，这些人居于天堂之光，而这光含有聪明。但那些只居于尘世之光的人却无法明白它们，因为这光没有聪明，除非它含有天堂之光在里面。对居于天堂之光的天使来说，这些奥秘属于他们所知的最为普通的事。<br />由此可见“神收拾了我的羞耻”和“愿耶和华再增添我一个儿子”这些话在至高意义上表示主的神性属灵层；在内在意义上表示主的属灵国度，或信之良善；因为这种良善就是存在于该国度中的属灵层。不过，这些话在外在意义上之所以表示得救，以及繁殖增多，是因为这一切作为该良善的产物而到来（参看<a href="3971.htm">3971</a>节）。至于何为主的属灵国度，这可从前面有关该国度的反复阐述和说明清楚可知，也就是说，它是由那些处于仁，并由此处于信的人组成的。该国度不同于主的属天国度，因为属天国度是由那些处于对主之爱，并由此处于仁的人组成的。这些人构成第三层或至内层天堂，而那些属灵的人则构成第二层或内层天堂。<br />经上之所以先提及“神”，说“神收拾了我的羞耻”，然后提及“耶和华”，说“愿耶和华再增添我一个儿子”，是因为神关注从真理向良善的上升，而耶和华关注从良善向真理的下降。属灵人处于信之良善，也就是处于真理所源于的良善；而他在变得属灵之前，处于信之真理，也就是处于拥有良善在里面的真理。因为当主题是真理时，就用“神”这个名；当主题是良善时，则“耶和华”这个名（<a href="2586.htm">2586</a>，<a href="2807.htm">2807</a>，<a href="2822.htm">2822</a>，<a href="3921.htm">3921</a>节）。<br />“约瑟”代表主的属灵国度，或属灵人，因而代表信之良善；这一点也可从圣言中提及他的经文看出来，如雅各，那里叫以色列的预言：<br />约瑟是多结果子的儿子，是泉旁多结果的儿子；女儿啊，她爬到墙上；弓箭手狠狠苦害他，向他射箭，怀恨逼迫他；但他的弓仍旧坚硬；他的手臂健壮敏捷，这是因以色列的牧者，以色列的磐石，就是雅各的大能者；你父亲的神必帮助你，因着沙代，祂必将天上所有的福，下面所藏深渊的福，以及生产乳养的福，都赐给你。你父亲所祝的福，胜过我祖先所祝的福，永世山岭的愿望；它们必降在约瑟的头上，临到他弟兄拿细耳人的头顶上。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.22.htm">49:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.26.htm">26</a>）<br />这些预言的话在至高意义上包含了对主的神性属灵层的描述；在内在意义上则包含了对其属灵国度的描述。至于每个细节包含什么，蒙主的神性怜悯，我们将在解释那一章时予以阐述。<br />摩西五经中的预言同样如此：<br />论到约瑟，他说，愿他的地蒙耶和华赐福，得天上的宝物、甘露，以及下面所藏的深渊；得太阳果实的宝物，月亮所养成的宝物；得东方之山的至宝，永世之岭的宝物；得地和其中所充满的宝物，并住荆棘中者的美意；它们都临到约瑟的头上，临到他弟兄拿细耳人的头顶上。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.13.htm">33:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.17.htm">17</a>）<br />由于“以色列”代表主的属灵教会（参看<a href="3305.htm">3305</a>，<a href="3654.htm">3654</a>节），故雅各，那时叫以色列，临终前对约瑟说：<br />我未到埃及见你之先，你在埃及地所生的这两个儿子是我的；以法莲和玛拿西是我的，正如流便和西缅是我的一样。救赎我脱离一切患难的那使者，赐福与这两个童子。愿他们归在我的名下和我祖亚伯拉罕和以撒的名下，又愿他们在那地中间生养众多。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创48.5.htm">48:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创48.16.htm">16</a>）<br />有两样事物构成属灵教会，即理解或认知和意愿，“以法莲”代表理解或认知，“玛拿西”代表意愿。由此可见为何约瑟的两个儿子被雅各，那时叫以色列，收养，并被承认为雅各自己的。“以法莲”在圣言中也经常被提及，尤其在预言部分；在那些地方，这个名字表示属灵教会所拥有的理解真理与良善的能力。<br />以西结书：<br />耶和华说，人子啊，你要取一根木杖，在其上写为犹大和他的同伴以色列人；又取一根木杖，在其上写为约瑟，就是以法莲的木杖，又为他的同伴以色列全家；你要使这两根木杖接连为一，成为一根木杖，在你手中成为一根。主耶和华如此说：看哪，我要将约瑟和他同伴以色列支派的杖，就是那在以法莲手中的，与犹大的杖一同接连为一根木杖，在我手中成为一根。我要使他们在那地，在以色列山上成为一个民族，有一王作他们众人的王。他们不再是两个民族，决不再分为二国。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.16.htm">37:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.17.htm">17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.19.htm">19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.22.htm">22</a>）<br />此处论述的是主的属天和属灵国度。“犹大”是指属天国度（<a href="3654.htm">3654</a>，<a href="3881.htm">3881</a>节，<a href="3921.htm">3921</a>末尾）；“约瑟”是指属灵国度；经上说这些国不再为二，要为一。它们因主的降世的的确确成为一。<br />属灵之人因主的到来而得救 （参看<a href="2661.htm">2661</a>，<a href="2716.htm">2716</a>，<a href="2833.htm">2833</a>，<a href="2834.htm">2834</a>节）。主在约翰福音中所谈论的，正是那些属灵之人：<br />我另外有羊，不是这圈里的；我必须领他们来，他们也要听我的声音，并且要合成一群，归一个牧人了。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.16.htm">10:16</a>）<br />这就是“犹大的约瑟两根木杖一同接连为一，在主手中成为一根”所表示的。因为属天天使构成第三层，也就是至内层的天堂；而属灵天使则构成第二层，也就是内层天堂；他们在那里为一，因为一个流入别一个，也就是属天天堂流入属灵天堂。属灵国度可以说是属天国度立于其上的基础，这二者以此方式变得坚实稳固。因为第三层或至内层天堂中的神性属天层是对主之爱；该天堂中的属天-属灵层是仁爱。后者，即仁爱，是属灵天使所在的第二层或内层天堂的主要事物。这表明流注的性质，还表明事物如何通过流注变得坚实稳固。“木”表示良善，既表对主之爱的良善，也表对邻之仁的良善（<a href="2784.htm">2784</a>，<a href="2812.htm">2812</a>，<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>节）。正因如此，经上吩咐犹大和约瑟要“写在两根木杖上”，而这两根木杖要成为一根。<br />撒迦利亚书：<br />我要坚固犹大家，拯救约瑟家，要领他们归回。我要怜恤他们，他们就像我不曾弃绝的一样；都因我是耶和华他们的神，我必应允他们。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚10.6.htm">10:6</a>）<br />此处也论述了两个国，即属天国和属灵国，“犹大”是指属天国，“约瑟”是指属灵国，还论述了属灵之人的得救。<br />阿摩司书：<br />耶和华向以色列家如此说：你们要寻求我，就必存活。要寻求耶和华，就必存活，免得祂在约瑟家像火发出，这火会吞灭，无人扑灭它。要恨恶邪恶，喜爱良善，在城门口确立公义；或者耶和华万军之神向约瑟的余民施恩。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩5.4.htm">5:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩5.6.htm">6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩5.15.htm">15</a>）<br />此处“约瑟”与表示那些属灵之人；“以色列家”表示属灵教会（<a href="3305.htm">3305</a>，<a href="3654.htm">3654</a>节）；“约瑟”表示该教会的良善，故经上说“耶和华向以色列家如此说：你们要寻求我，就必存活，免得祂在约瑟家像火发出”。<br />诗篇：<br />领约瑟如领羊群之以色列的牧者啊，求你侧耳而听！坐在二基路伯上的啊，求你发出光来！在以法莲、便雅悯和玛拿西面前，施展你的大能来救我们。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗80.1.htm">80:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗80.3.htm">3</a>）<br />此处“约瑟”同样表示属灵人；“以法莲、便雅悯和玛拿西”是指那教会的三个要素。<br /><br />唱起诗歌，打手鼓，弹美琴与瑟。当在新月和节期，在我们过节的日子吹角；因这是为以色列定的律例，是雅各神的典章；他去攻击埃及地的时候，向约瑟立此为证；我听见我所不认识的语言。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗81.2.htm">81:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗81.5.htm">5</a>）<br />“约瑟”在此表示属灵教会，或属灵人，这一点从每句话、每个词明显看出来。因为在圣言中，有些术语表述属灵事物，有些术语表述属天事物，这些术语贯穿于圣言的始终。这段经文中有些词表述属灵事物，如“诗歌”、“角”、“琴与瑟”、“在新月和节期，在我们过节的日子吹角”。由此也明显可知，所论述的主题是“约瑟”所表示的属灵教会。<br />以西结书：<br />主耶和华如此说，这是你们按以色列十二支派分地为业的界限；约瑟必得两分。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.13.htm">47:13</a>）<br />这论及主的属灵国度；故经上说“约瑟必得两分”。主的神性属灵层还被称为祂的“王权”；因为主的“王权”是指祂的神性真理；而祂的“祭司职分”是指祂的神性良善（<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="3009.htm">3009</a>，<a href="3670.htm">3670</a>节）。主的王权本身就是“约瑟”所代表的，因为他成为埃及地的王。蒙主的神性怜悯，等到那一章时，我们再论述这个代表。<br />至于“约瑟”在至高意义上所代表的主的神性属灵层，或神性真理，它不在主里面，而是从主流出；因为主无非是神性良善；而神性真理则从这神性良善发出。打个比方说，这就像太阳及其光，这光不在太阳里面，而是从太阳发出；或像火，这火之光并不在火里面，而是从这火发出。在圣言中，神性良善本身也被比作“太阳”和“火”，而且被实际称呼为“太阳”和“火”。主的属天国从主所发出的良善接受生命，而主的属灵国从源于这良善的真理接受生命。因此，在来世，主向属天之人显为一轮太阳；向属灵之人显为一轮月亮（<a href="1053.htm">1053</a>，<a href="1521.htm">1521</a>，<a href="1529.htm">1529</a>-<a href="1531.htm">1531</a>，<a href="3636.htm">3636</a>，<a href="3643.htm">3643</a>节）。热和光都从这太阳发出，热好比爱之良善，也被称作属天和属灵之热；光好比从这良善所流出的真理，也被称作属灵之光（<a href="3636.htm">3636</a>，<a href="3643.htm">3643</a>节）。不过，在来世，从显为太阳的主所发出的属天之热和属灵之光里面有爱之良善和信之真理，因而有智慧和聪明（<a href="1521.htm">1521</a>-<a href="1523.htm">1523</a>，<a href="1542.htm">1542</a>，<a href="1619.htm">1619</a>-<a href="1632.htm">1632</a>，<a href="2776.htm">2776</a>，<a href="3138.htm">3138</a>，<a href="3190.htm">3190</a>，<a href="3195.htm">3195</a>，<a href="3222.htm">3222</a>，<a href="3223.htm">3223</a>，<a href="3339.htm">3339</a>，<a href="3485.htm">3485</a>，<a href="3636.htm">3636</a>，<a href="3643.htm">3643</a>，<a href="3862.htm">3862</a>节）；因为从主所发出的一切都是活的。<br />由此可见：何为神性属灵层；属灵国和属天国即源于此；属灵国就是信之良善，这良善就是既从主直接流入、也经由属天国间接流入的仁爱。在圣言中，从主发出的神性属灵层被称为“真理的圣灵”（Spirit of truth），就是神圣真理。神性属灵层并不属于任何灵人，而属于主，主通过祂所差遣的一个灵人赋予它；这一点从主自己在约翰福音中所说的话可以清楚看出来：<br />只等真理的圣灵来了，祂要引导你们进入一切的真理；因为祂不是凭着自己说的，乃是要把祂所听见的都说出来，并要把将来的事告诉你们。祂要荣耀我，因为祂要将受于我的告诉你们。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.13.htm">16:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.14.htm">14</a>）</p>

And said, God hath gathered my reproach. And she called his name Joseph, saying, Let Jehovah add to me another son. That this signifies in the supreme sense the Lord as to the Divine spiritual; in the 
internal sense, the spiritual kingdom, or the good of faith; and in the external sense, salvation, also fructification and multiplication, is evident from the representation of Joseph in the Word (concerning 
which below); and from the signification of "God hath gathered my reproach," and also of "Let Jehovah add to me another son;" for he was named "Joseph" from "gathering" and "adding." "God hath 
gathered my reproach," signifies that Rachel was now no longer barren, and thus was not "dead," as she said of herself to Jacob (verse 1, n. 3908). For by Rachel is represented the affection of interior 
truth, or the interior man as to truth (n. 3758, 3782, 3793, 3819). The interior man is as it were dead as to truth and good, if the exterior or natural man does not correspond to it in respect 
to goods and truths (see n. 3493, 3620, 3623).  [2] These must be conjoined with each other, so as to be not two, but together one man. This conjunction cannot come forth until the natural or external 
man has been prepared, that is, until it has received and acknowledged the general truths signified by the ten sons of Jacob by Leah and the handmaids; and until the good of the natural man has been 
conjoined with the truths therein, which conjunction is signified by the last son of Jacob by Leah, namely, by Zebulun, who was so called from "dwelling together" (n. 3960, 3961). After this conjunction 
has been effected, the interior man and the exterior enter into the heavenly marriage, spoken of above (n. 3952). The reason why they do not enter into it before, is a great secret; for it is the 
good of the interior man which then conjoins itself with the good of the exterior, and by means of this with the truth therein; and likewise the good of the interior man by means of the affection of the 
truth therein, conjoins itself with the good of the exterior man, and also with the truth therein; thus immediately and mediately (concerning which immediate and mediate conjunction see above, n. 3314, 
3573, 3616). As the interior man is then first conjoined with the exterior, and as before this conjunction has been effected the interior man is as it were null, and thus is as it were dead (as stated 
above), it is therefore said, "God hath gathered my reproach." This then is what is signified by the "reproach" which God is said to have "gathered," that is, to have taken away, or from which He 
is said to have delivered her.  [3] But by the words which follow: "Let Jehovah add to me another son," from which Joseph was named, another arcanum is signified, which is this. By Joseph there is 
represented the Lord's spiritual kingdom, thus the spiritual man; for this kingdom is in every spiritual man. There are two things that constitute the spiritual man, namely, charity and faith; or what 
is the same, good and truth. The charity from which is faith, or the good from which is truth, is that which is represented by Joseph; and the faith in which is charity, or the truth in which is good, 
is that which is signified by "another son," and is represented by Benjamin-concerning whom in Gen. 35:16-18. Thus "Joseph" is the celestial spiritual man; and "Benjamin" the spiritual celestial. What 
is the difference between these two may be seen from what has been very frequently said before concerning the good from which is truth, and the truth in which is good. This then is what is signified 
by Rachel's other words: "Let Jehovah add to me another son." But these arcana cannot be seen except by those who are in the charity of faith; for these are as to their interiors in the light of heaven, 
in which light there is also intelligence. But they cannot be seen by those who are only in the light of the world, for in this light there is not intelligence, except insofar as the light of heaven 
is within it. To the angels, who are in the light of heaven, these are among the most common things. [4] From all this we can now see that by these words, "God hath gathered my reproach," and "Let 
Jehovah add to me another son," in the supreme sense is signified the Lord as to the Divine spiritual; and in the internal sense, the Lord's spiritual kingdom, or the good of faith; for this is the 
spiritual in that kingdom. But that in the external sense by these words is signified salvation, also fructification and multiplication, is because this follows (see n. 3971). The Lord's spiritual kingdom, 
as already repeatedly stated and shown, consists of those who are in charity and thereby in faith. It is distinct from the Lord's celestial kingdom, for this contains those who are in love to the 
Lord, and thereby in charity. These constitute the third or inmost heaven; but those who are spiritual constitute the second or interior heaven. [5] The reason why "God" is first mentioned-"God hath 
gathered my reproach," and then "Jehovah"-"Let Jehovah add to me another son" is that the former name regards the ascent from truth to good, but the latter the descent from good to truth; for the spiritual 
man is in the good of faith (that is, in good from which there is truth); but before he becomes spiritual he is in the truth of faith (that is, in truth in which there is good); for "God" is used 
when the subject is truth; but "Jehovah" when it is good (n. 2586, 2807, 2822, 3921). [6] That by Joseph is represented the Lord's spiritual kingdom, or the spiritual man, and thus the good of faith, 
may also be seen from the passages in the Word where he is mentioned; as in the prophecy of Jacob, then Israel: </p>
<p>     Joseph is the son of a fruitful one, the son of a fruitful one by a fountain, 
of a daughter, she marcheth upon the wall; the archers shall sorely grieve him and shall shoot at him, and shall hate him; but he shall abide in the strength of his bow; and the arms of his hands shall 
be made strong by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob; from thence is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel; by the God of thy father, and He shall help thee, and with Shaddai, and He shall bless thee 
with blessings of heaven from above, with blessings of the deep that lieth beneath, blessings of the breasts and of the womb; the blessings of thy father shall prevail over the blessings of my progenitors 
even to the desire of the everlasting hills; they shall be upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the head of the Nazarite of his brethren (Gen. 49:22-26). In these prophetic words there 
is contained in the supreme sense a description of the Lord's Divine spiritual; and in the internal sense, of His spiritual kingdom. What each particular involves shall of the Lord's Divine mercy be 
stated in the explication of that chapter. [7] So in the prophecy of Moses: </p>
<p>     To Joseph he said, Blessed of Jehovah be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep 
that lieth beneath; and for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, and for the precious things of the increase of the months; and for the firstfruits of the mountains of the east, and for the precious 
things of the everlasting hills; and for the precious things of the earth and the fullness thereof; and the good will of him that dwelt in the bush; they shall come upon the head of Joseph, and 
upon the crown of the head of the Nazarite of his brethren (Deut. 33:13-17). [8] As Israel represented the Lord's spiritual church (see n. 3305, 3654), therefore Jacob, then Israel, before his death 
said to Joseph: </p>
<p>     Thy two sons, who were born unto thee in the land of Egypt, before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon. The angel who 
hath redeemed me from all evil bless the lads, that my name may be named upon them, and the name of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the land (Gen. 48:5, 
16). For there are two things that constitute the spiritual church-the understanding and the will, of which the understanding is represented by Ephraim, and the will by Manasseh. From this it is 
evident why Joseph's two sons were adopted by Jacob, then Israel, and were acknowledged as his own. "Ephraim" is also frequently mentioned in the Word, especially the prophetic Word, and by him is there 
signified the intellectual of truth and good, which belongs to the spiritual church. [9] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Jehovah said, Son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah and for the 
sons of Israel his companions and take another stick and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and all the house of Israel his companions; and join them for thee one to another, into one stick, 
that they both may become one in thy* hand. Thus said the Lord Jehovih, Behold,** I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim and the tribes of Israel his companions, and I will 
put them with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in My hand. And I will make them one nation in the land, in the mountains of Israel, and one king shall be king to 
them all, and they shall be no more two nations, and they shall no more be divided into two kingdoms again (Ezek. 37:16-17, 19, 22). The Lord's celestial and spiritual kingdoms are here treated of. The 
celestial kingdom is "Judah" (n. 3654, 3881, 3921 at the end); the spiritual kingdom is "Joseph;" and it is said that these kingdoms shall not be two, but one. They were also made into one by the coming 
of the Lord into the world.  [10] (That the spiritual were saved by the Lord's coming, may be seen above, n. 2661, 2716, 2833, 2834.) It is the spiritual of whom the Lord speaks in John: </p>
<p>     
And other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, and one Shepherd (John 10:16). This is what is signified by the 
"two sticks, of Judah and Joseph, which shall be joined together into one, and shall be one in the Lord's hand." For the celestial constitute the third heaven, which is the inmost; but the spiritual the 
second heaven, which is the interior; and they are there one, because the one flows into the other (that is, the celestial into the spiritual), the spiritual kingdom being as a plane to the celestial, 
and in this way they have been firmly coestablished. For the Divine celestial in the third or inmost heaven is love to the Lord; and the celestial spiritual there is charity. This charity is the chief 
thing in the second or interior heaven, where the spiritual are. This shows what is the nature of the influx, and also of the coestablishment by means of the influx. "Wood" signifies good, both the 
good of love to the Lord, and the good of charity toward the neighbor (n. 2784, 2812, 3720). For this reason it was commanded that Judah and Joseph should be "written upon sticks of wood," which should 
"become one." [11] So in Zechariah: </p>
<p>     I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will cause them to dwell, for I have mercy upon them; and they shall be 
as though I had not left them; for I Jehovah am their God, and I will answer them (Zech. 10:6); </p>
<p>here again the subject is the two kingdoms, the celestial and the spiritual (the celestial being "Judah," 
and the spiritual "Joseph"), and the salvation of the spiritual. [12] In Amos: </p>
<p>     Thus said Jehovah unto the house of Israel, Seek ye Me, and ye shall live. Seek Jehovah, and ye shall live, lest 
He break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and it devour, and there be none to quench it. Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate; it may be that Jehovah God Zebaoth 
will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph (Amos 5:4, 6, 15); </p>
<p>where also the spiritual are signified by "Joseph;" the "house of Israel" is the spiritual church (n. 3305, 3654); "Joseph" is the good 
of this church, and it is therefore said, "Jehovah said unto the house of Israel, Seek ye Me, and ye shall live, lest He break out like fire in the house of Joseph." [13] In David: </p>
<p>     Give ear, 
O Shepherd of Israel, Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; Thou that sittest upon the cherubim, shine forth. Before Ephraim, and Benjamin, and Manasseh, stir up Thy might, and come and save us (Ps. 
80:1-3); </p>
<p>here also in like manner "Joseph" is the spiritual man; "Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh" are the three constituents of that church. [14] Again: </p>
<p>     Lift up the song and give the timbrel, 
the pleasant harp with the psaltery; blow the trumpet in the new moon, in the festival, on the day of our feast; for this is a statute for Israel, a judgment to the God of Jacob; he appointed it to Joseph 
for a testimony, when he went out against the land of Egypt; I heard a language that I knew not (Ps. 81:2-5); </p>
<p>that "Joseph" here is the spiritual church, or the spiritual man, is manifest from 
every word and expression; for in the Word there are terms that express spiritual things, and others that express celestial things, and this with uniformity throughout. In this passage there are words 
that express spiritual things; as "song," "timbrel," the "harp with the psaltery," "blowing the trumpet in the new moon, in the festival on the day of our feast." From this also it is manifest that the 
subject is the spiritual church, which is "Joseph." [15] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Thus said the Lord Jehovih, This shall be the border whereby ye shall inherit the land, according to the twelve tribes of 
Israel; the lines shall be to Joseph (Ezek. 47:13); </p>
<p>where the subject is the Lord's spiritual kingdom; and it is therefore said, "the lines shall be to Joseph." The Lord's Divine Spiritual is that which 
is also called His "royalty;" for the Lord's "royalty" is His Divine truth; and His "priesthood" is His Divine good (n. 2015, 3009, 3670). The Lord's royalty itself is that which is represented by 
Joseph, in his being made king in the land of Egypt, which representation shall of the Lord's Divine mercy be treated of in its place. [16] As regards the Lord's Divine Spiritual, or the Divine truth, 
which in the supreme sense is represented by Joseph, it is not in the Lord, but is from the Lord; for the Lord is nothing but Divine good; but the Divine truth proceeds from the Divine good. To speak 
comparatively, this is like the sun and its light; the light is not in the sun, but proceeds from it; or it is like a fire, the light of which is not in the fire, but proceeds from the fire. The Divine 
good itself is also compared in the Word to the "sun," and to "fire," and is likewise called the "sun" and "fire." The Lord's celestial kingdom lives from the good which proceeds from the Lord; but 
His spiritual kingdom from the truth thence derived; and therefore in the other life the Lord appears to the celestial as a sun; but to the spiritual as a moon (n. 1053, 1521, 1529-1531, 3636, 3643). 
Both heat and light proceed from the sun, the heat being-to speak comparatively-the good of love, which is also called celestial and spiritual heat; and the light, the truth thence derived, which is 
also called spiritual light (n. 3636, 3643). But within the celestial heat and spiritual light that in the other life proceed from the Lord as a sun, there are the good of love and the truth of faith, 
thus wisdom and intelligence (n. 1521-1523, 1542, 1619-1632, 2776, 3138, 3190, 3195, 3222, 3223, 3339, 3485, 3636, 3643, 3862); for all that which proceeds from the Lord is living.  [17] From this 
we can see what the Divine Spiritual is; and whence comes the spiritual kingdom, and the celestial kingdom; and that the spiritual kingdom is the good of faith, that is, charity, which flows in from 
the Lord immediately, and also mediately through the celestial kingdom. The Divine Spiritual that proceeds from the Lord is called in the Word the "spirit of truth," and is holy truth; not being of any 
spirit, but of the Lord through a spirit sent by Him; as may be seen from the words of the Lord Himself in John: </p>
<p>     When He, the Spirit of Truth, shall come, He will guide you into all the truth; 
for He shall not speak from Himself; but what things soever He shall hear, these shall He speak; and He shall declare unto you the things that are to come. He shall glorify Me; for He shall take of Mine, 
and shall declare it unto you (John 16:13-14). * Latin, mea. ** Latin, Ego, ecce Ego. </p>

'And she said, God has taken away my reproach. And she called his name Joseph, saying, May Jehovah add to me another son' in the highest sense means the Lord as regards the Divine Spiritual, in the internal 
sense the spiritual kingdom or the good of faith, and in the external sense salvation, also fruitfulness and multiplication. This is clear from the representation of 'Joseph' in the Word, dealt 
with below, also from the meaning of 'God has taken away my reproach', as well as 'May Jehovah add to me another son', for the name Joseph was derived from the verbs 'to gather up' and 'to add'. 'God 
has taken away my reproach' means that Rachel was now no longer barren, and so no longer 'dead', as she spoke of herself to Jacob in verse 1 above; see <a href="3908.htm">3908</a>. For 'Rachel' represents the affection for 
interior truth, that is, the interior man as regards truth, <a href="3758.htm">3758</a>, <a href="3782.htm">3782</a>, <a href="3793.htm">3793</a>, <a href="3819.htm">3819</a>. The interior man is so to speak dead as regards truth and good if the exterior or natural man does not correspond 
to it as regards goods and truths, see <a href="3493.htm">3493</a>, <a href="3620.htm">3620</a>, <a href="3623.htm">3623</a>. They must be so joined each to the other that they are not two but together form one man. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But the two cannot become joined together until 
the natural or external man has been prepared, that is, until it has received and acknowledged the general truths which have been meant by Jacob's ten sons by Leah and the servant-girls, and until the 
good of the natural man has been joined to the truths in that man, which joining together was meant by Jacob's last son by Leah, namely Zebulun, who was so called from the expression 'dwelling together', <a href="3960.htm">3960</a>, <a href="3961.htm">3961</a>. After this joining together has taken place the interior man and the exterior man enter into the heavenly marriage spoken of in <a href="3952.htm">3952</a>. The reason they do not enter it until then is a 
very deep arcanum, for it is the good of the interior man which in that case joins itself to the good of the exterior man, and through that exterior good to the truth in the exterior man. At the same 
time the good of the interior man joins itself through the affection for truth in that interior man to the good of the exterior man and also to the truth there, and so joins itself directly and indirectly. 
concerning this direct and indirect linking together, see <a href="3314.htm">3314</a>, <a href="3573.htm">3573</a>, <a href="3616.htm">3616</a>. Since the interior man is only then joined to the exterior, and until this joining together has taken place the interior 
man is seemingly non-existent and so seemingly dead, as stated above, the phrase 'God has taken away my reproach' is therefore used. This then is what is meant by 'the reproach' which God is said 
to have 'gathered up', that is, to have taken away, meaning to have released her from it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But the words which follow - 'May Jehovah add to me another son', from which Joseph received his name - 
mean a second arcanum, which is this: 'Joseph' represents the Lord's spiritual kingdom and so the spiritual man, for that kingdom exists within every spiritual man. There are two things which constitute 
the spiritual man - charity and faith, or what amounts to the same, good and truth. Charity from which faith, or good from which truth springs, is the thing that Joseph represents. And faith which 
has charity within it, or truth which has good within it, is the thing that the second son means - that Benjamin represents, dealt with at <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2035:16-18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 35:16-18</a>. So Joseph means the celestial-spiritual man, 
and Benjamin the spiritual-celestial. The nature of the difference between them may be seen from what has been said fairly often already about good from which truth springs and truth that has good within 
it. This then is what is meant by Rachel's second utterance 'May Jehovah add to me another son'. But these arcana cannot be seen except by those who are governed by charity from which faith springs, 
for interiorly those people are dwelling in the light of heaven, which light also includes intelligence within it. But those arcana cannot be seen by those who are dwelling solely in the light of the 
world, for that light does not include intelligence except insofar as it holds the light of heaven within itself. To angels who dwell in the light of heaven these arcana belong among the most ordinary 
things they know. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 From these considerations one may now see that the words 'God has taken away my reproach' and 'May Jehovah add to me another son' in the highest sense mean the Lord as regards 
the Divine Spiritual, and in the internal sense the Lord's spiritual kingdom or the good of faith, for such good is the spiritual as this exists in that kingdom. But the reason why those words in 
the external sense mean salvation, also fruitfulness and multiplication, is that these come as the product of that good, <a href="3971.htm">3971</a>. But what the Lord's spiritual kingdom is may become clear from what has 
been stated and shown many times already about that kingdom, that is to say, it consists of those who are governed by charity and from charity by faith. This kingdom is distinct and separate from the 
Lord's celestial kingdom, for the celestial kingdom consists of those who are governed by love to the Lord and from that love by charity. The latter constitute the third or inmost heaven, whereas the 
spiritual constitute the second or interior heaven. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 The reason why the name God is used first, in 'God has taken away my reproach', then Jehovah, in 'May Jehovah add to me another son', is that 
God has regard to the ascent from truth up to good but Jehovah to the descent from good down to truth. The spiritual man is governed by the good of faith, that is, by the good from which truth springs; 
but prior to his becoming spiritual he is governed by the truth of faith, that is, by truth that has good within it. For the name God is used when truth is the subject, but Jehovah when good is the 
subject, <a href="2586.htm">2586</a>, <a href="2769.htm">2769</a>, <a href="2807.htm">2807</a>, <a href="2822.htm">2822</a>, <a href="3921.htm">3921</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 The fact that 'Joseph' represents the Lord's spiritual kingdom, or the spiritual man, and so represents the good of faith, becomes clear also from those 
places in the Word where his name is mentioned, as in the prophecy of Jacob, who by then was Israel, </p>
<blockquote>
The son of a fruitful one is Joseph, the son of a fruitful one beside a spring; O daughters, he 
trails over the wall; and the archers will exasperate him and shoot at him and hate him. And he will sit in the strength of his bow, and the arms of his hands will be made strong by the hands of the Mighty 
One of Jacob; from there is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel. By the God of your father, and he will assist you; and with Shaddai, and he will bless you with the blessings of heaven from above, 
with the blessings of the deep lying beneath, with the blessings of the breasts and of the womb. The blessings of your father will prevail over the blessings of my ancestors, even to the desire of the 
everlasting hills. They will be upon the head of Joseph and upon the crown of the head of the Nazirite among his brothers. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2049:22-26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 49:22-26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>These prophetic utterances in the highest sense contain a 
description of the Lord's Divine Spiritual, in the internal sense a description of His spiritual kingdom. What each detail entails will in the Lord's Divine mercy be discussed in the explanation of that 
chapter. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 Similarly in the prophecy of Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
For Joseph he said, Blessed by Jehovah is his land, of the precious things of heaven, of the dew, of the deep also lying beneath, and of the 
precious things of the fruits of the sun, and of the precious things of the produce of the months, and of the precious things of the mountains of the east, and of the precious things of the everlasting 
hills, and of the precious things of the earth and of its fullness; and the good pleasure of Him dwelling in the bramble bush. They will come upon the head of Joseph and upon the crown of the head of 
the Nazirite among his brothers. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2033:13-17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 33:13-17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 Because 'Israel' represents the Lord's spiritual Church, <a href="3305.htm">3305</a>, <a href="3654.htm">3654</a>, Jacob, who by then was Israel, said to Joseph, </p>
<blockquote>
Your two sons who were 
born to you in the land of Egypt, before I came to you in Egypt, will be mine. Ephraim and Manasseh will be as Reuben and Simeon. May the angel who has redeemed me from every evil bless the boys, that 
in them my name may be called, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and may they increase into a multitude in the midst of the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2048:5,%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 48:5, 16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>There are two things which constitute 
the spiritual Church - the understanding and the will, the understanding being represented by 'Ephraim' and the will by 'Manasseh'. From this one can see why Joseph's two sons were adopted by Jacob, 
by then Israel, and acknowledged as his own. Ephraim is also mentioned often in the Word, especially the prophetical part, in which places that name means the ability which the spiritual Church possesses 
to understand what is true and what is good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah said, Son of man, take a stick and write on it, For Judah and for the children of Israel, his companions. And take another

hand. Thus said the Lord Jehovih, I, behold, I am taking the stick of Joseph which is in the hand of Ephraim and of the tribes of Israel his companions, and I will add them to the stick of Judah, and 
make them into one stick, and they will be one in My hand. And I will make them into one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king will be king to them all, and they will no longer 
be two nations, nor will they ever be divided into two nations again. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2037:16,%2017,%2019,%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 37:16, 17, 19, 22</a>.

<p>This refers to the Lord's kingdom, to the celestial and to the spiritual - 'Judah' being the celestial 
kingdom, <a href="3654.htm">3654</a>, <a href="3881.htm">3881</a>, <a href="3921.htm">3921</a> (end), and 'Joseph' the spiritual. It is also said that those kingdoms will not be two but one - they were actually made one by the Lord's Coming into the world. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[10]</b>
By the Lord's Coming the spiritual were saved, see <a href="2661.htm">2661</a>, <a href="2716.htm">2716</a>, <a href="2833.htm">2833</a>, <a href="2834.htm">2834</a>. It is those who are spiritual that the Lord is speaking about in John, </p>
<blockquote>
And other sheep I have which are not of this fold; 
I must bring them also, and they will hear My voice, and there will be one Bock and one shepherd. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2010:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 10:16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This is what is meant by 'the two sticks', the stick of Judah and the stick of Joseph, 
which will be joined into one, and will be one in the Lord's hand, like one nation, even as they are one in the Lord's kingdom. For celestial angels constitute the third heaven, which is the inmost heaven, 
but spiritual angels the second, which is the interior heaven, and in that kingdom they are one because one flows into the other, namely the celestial heaven into the spiritual. The spiritual kingdom 
is so to speak the groundwork on which the celestial is based, and in this way the two are made firm and stable. For the Divine celestial within the third or inmost heaven is love to the Lord, the 
celestial-spiritual in that heaven being charity. The latter, namely charity, is the chief thing in the second or interior heaven where spiritual angels are. This shows the nature of influx and also 
how things are made firm and stable by means of influx. 'Wood' means good, both the good which belongs to love to the Lord and the good which belongs to charity towards the neighbour, <a href="2784.htm">2784</a>, <a href="2812.htm">2812</a>, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>. 
For this reason the command was given to write Judah and Joseph on the two sticks which were to be made one. </p>

<p>From each individual word 
or term used here it is evident that 'Joseph' means the spiritual Church or spiritual man. For there are in the Word terms which present spiritual realities and terms which present celestial ones, 
and these terms occur consistently throughout the Word. In this quotation terms that present spiritual realities are used - 'a song', 'the timbrel', 'the harp with the lyre', and 'blowing the trumpet 
at the new moon, at the festival, on a feast day'. From this also it is evident that the subject is the spiritual Church meant by 'Joseph'. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord's spiritual kingdom, and therefore the phrase 
'the portions for Joseph' is used. The Lord's Divine spiritual is that which is also called His kingship, for the Lord's kingship is Divine Truth, but His priesthood Divine Good, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="3009.htm">3009</a>, <a href="3670.htm">3670</a>. The 
Lord's kingship itself is that which 'Joseph' represents, in that he was made king in the land of Egypt. That representation will in the Lord's Divine mercy be dealt with when that chapter is reached. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[16]</b>
As regards the Lord's Divine spiritual, or Divine Truth, which is represented in the highest sense by 'Joseph', it does not exist within the Lord but flows from the Lord; for the Lord is nothing 
else than Divine Good. But Divine Truth proceeds from Divine Good. To use a comparison, it is like the sun and the light of the sun. Light does not exist within the sun but proceeds from the sun. 
Or it is like fire. Light does not exist in fire but proceeds from it. And in the Word Divine Good itself is compared to the sun and also to fire, and is actually called sun and fire. The Lord's celestial 
kingdom receives its life from the good which proceeds from the Lord, but the spiritual kingdom receives its life from the truth derived from that good. For this reason in the next life the Lord 
is seen as the Sun by those who are celestial, but as the Moon by those who are spiritual, see <a href="1053.htm">1053</a>, <a href="1521.htm">1521</a>, <a href="1529.htm">1529</a>-<a href="1531.htm">1531</a>, <a href="3636.htm">3636</a>, <a href="3643.htm">3643</a>. For both warmth and light proceed from the sun. Its warmth is comparable 
to the good of love, which is also called celestial and spiritual warmth, its light to the truth flowing from it, which is also referred to as spiritual light, see <a href="3636.htm">3636</a>, <a href="3643.htm">3643</a>. But the celestial warmth 
and the spiritual light which proceed from the Lord as the Sun in the next life, include within them the good of love and the truth of faith, and so include wisdom and intelligence, <a href="1521.htm">1521</a>-<a href="1523.htm">1523</a>, <a href="1542.htm">1542</a>,

 From this one may see what the Divine Spiritual is; in what 
the spiritual kingdom and the celestial kingdom have their origins; and also that the spiritual kingdom is the good of faith, which good is charity, flowing in from the Lord directly, and also indirectly 
through the celestial kingdom. In the Word the Divine Spiritual which proceeds from the Lord is called the Spirit of truth, and is holy truth. The Divine Spiritual does not belong to any spirit but 
is the Lord's, who imparts it through a spirit sent by Him, as becomes clear from the Lord's own words in John, </p>
<blockquote>
When He the Spirit of truth comes He will guide you into all the truth, for He will 
not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak. He will also declare to you the things that are to come. He will glorify Me, for He will receive from what is Mine and declare it 
to you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2016:-13,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 16:-13, 14</a>.

`Et dixit, Collegit Deus ignominiam meam, et vocavit nomen ejus Joseph, dicendo, Addat Jehovah mihi filium alterum': quod significet in sensu supremo Dominum quoad Divinum Spirituale, in sensu interno 
regnum spirituale seu bonum fidei, in externo salvationem, ac fructificationem et multiplicationem, constat ex repraesentatione `Josephi' in Verbo, de qua sequitur, tum ex significatione `collegit 
Deus ignominiam meam,' ut et `addat Jehovah mihi filium alterum,' Josephus enim a `colligere et addere' nominatus est: `collegit Deus ignominiam meam' significat quod Rachel nunc non amplius 
sterilis, ita non mortua esset, ut de se dixit ad Jacobum, vers. 1 hujus capitis, n. 3908; per `Rachelem' enim repraesentatur affectio veri interioris, seu interior homo quoad verum, n. 3758, 3782, 
3793, 3819; interior homo quoad verum et bonum sicut mortuus est, si non exterior seu naturalis homo ei correspondeat quoad bona et vera, videatur n. 3493, 3620, 3623; </p>
<p>illi utrinque conjuncti erunt, 
usque ut non duo sint, sed simul unus homo; [2] haec conjunctio non potest existere priusquam naturalis seu externus homo praeparatus est, hoc est, priusquam {1}recepit et agnovit communia vera, 
quae significata sunt per decem filios Jacobi ex Leah et ancillis, et priusquam bonum naturalis hominis conjunctum {2}est cum veris ibi, quae conjunctio significata est per ultimum filium Jacobi ex 
Lea, nempe per Zebulonem, qui a cohabitatione dictus est, n. 3960, 3961; postquam haec conjunctio facta est, tunc interior homo et exterior conjugium caeleste ineunt, de quo, n. 3952; causa quod 
non prius, est arcanissima, est enim bonum interioris hominis quod tunc se conjungit cum bono exterioris, et per hoc cum vero ibi, et quoque bonum interioris hominis per affectionem veri ibi cum bono exterioris 
hominis, et quoque cum vero ibi, ita immediate et mediate, de qua conjunctione immediata et mediata videatur n. 3314, 3573, 3616: quia tunc primum conjungitur interior homo cum exteriore, 
et priusquam haec conjunctio facta est, interior homo est quasi nullus, ita quasi mortuus, ut supra dictum, ideo dicitur `Collegit Deus ignominiam meam'; hoc nunc est quod significatur per `ignominiam' 
quam Deus collegisse, hoc est, abstulisse, seu a qua liberavisse, dicitur. [3] Per verba autem quae sequuntur, nempe per `addat Jehovah mihi filium alterum,' a quibus Josephus nominatus est, 
significatur alterum arcanum quod est hoc; per `Josephum' repraesentatur regnum spirituale Domini, ita spiritualis homo, nam in unoquovis spirituali homine est regnum illud; sunt duo quae {3}spiritualem 
hominem constituunt, nempe charitas et fides, seu quod idem, bonum et verum; charitas ex qua fides, seu bonum ex quo verum, est quod repraesentatur per Josephum; {4}et fides in qua charitas, 
seu verum in quo bonum, est quod significatur per filium alterum, et repraesentatur per Benjaminem,' de quo Gen. xxxv 16-18; </p>
<p>ita est `Josephus' caelestis spiritualis homo, et `Benjamin' spiritualis 
caelestis; quae differentia qualis sit, constare potest ab illis quae prius de bono ex quo verum, et de vero in quo bonum, saepius dicta sunt; hoc nunc est quod significatur per {5}altera verba 
Rachelis `Addat Jehovah mihi filium alterum': sed haec arcana non videri possunt nisi ab illis qui in charitate fidei sunt, nam illi quoad interiora in luce caeli sunt, in qua luce etiam est intelligentia; 
non autem ab illis qui solum in luce mundi sunt, nam in hac luce non est intelligentia, nisi quantum haec in se lucem caeli habet'; angelis qui in luce caeli sunt, haec inter communissima 
sunt.  [4] Ex his nunc constare potest quod per illa verba, nempe `collegit Deus ignominiam meam, et addat Jehovah mihi filium alterum,' in sensu supremo significetur Dominus quoad Divinum Spirituale; 
et in sensu interno regnum spirituale Domini, seu bonum fidei, nam hoc est spirituale quod in illo regno; quod autem in sensu externo per illa verba significetur salvatio, ac fructificatio et 
multiplicatio, est quia est consequens, n. 3971.  Quid autem regnum spirituale Domini, constare potest ab illis quae de illo regno multoties prius dicta et ostensa sunt, quod nempe sint illi qui 
in charitate et inde in fide sunt; distinguitur hoc regnum a regno caelesti Domini, in hoc enim sunt illi qui in amore in Dominum sunt, et inde {6}charitate; hi constituunt caelum tertium seu intimum, 
spirituales autem caelum secundum seu interius.  (m)Quod primum dicatur Deus, nempe `collegit DEUS ignominiam meam,' et mox Jehovah, nempe `addat JEHOVAH mihi filium alterum,' est causa quia prius 
spectat ascensum a vero ad bonum, at posterius descensum a bono ad verum; spiritualis homo est in bono fidei, hoc est in bono ex quo verum, at antequam fit spiritualis est in vero fidei, hoc est, 
in vero in quo bonum; `Deus' enim dicitur cum agitur de vero, {7}`Jehovah' autem cum de bono, n. 2586, 2769, 2807, 2807, 3921.  Quod per `Josephum' repraesentetur regnum spirituale Domini, seu homo 
spiritualis, ita bonum fidei, constare etiam potest ex illis locis in Verbo ubi nominatur, ut in prophetia Jacobi tunc Israelis: </p>
<p>     Filius fecundae Josephus, filius fecundae juxta fontem,   
   filiae, incedit super muro, et exacerbabunt illum et      jaculabuntur, et odio habebunt illum sagittarii: et sedebit in      firmitudine arcus sui, et roborabuntur brachia manuum illius,      a 
manibus fortis Jacobi, inde pastor, lapis Israelis: a Deo      patris tui, et auxiliabitur tibi, et cum Shaddai, et benedicet      tibi benedictionibus caeli desuper, benedictionibus abyssi      jacentis 
subtus, benedictionibus uberum et uteri: </p>
<p>     benedictiones patris tui praevalebunt super benedictionibus      genitorum meorum usque ad desiderium collium saeculi, erunt      capiti Josephi, 
et vertici naziraei fratrum illius, Gen. xlix      22-26; </p>
<p>in verbis his propheticis continetur {8}in supremo sensu descriptio Divini Spiritualis Domini, {9}in sensu interno regni spiritualis Ipsius; 
quid singula involvunt, in explicatione capitis illius, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, dicetur.  [7] Similiter in prophetia Mosis,      Josepho dixit, Benedicta a Jehovah terra illius, de pretiosis  
    caeli, de rore, de abysso etiam jacente subtus; et de      pretiosis proventuum solis, et de pretiosis producti mensium; </p>
<p>     et de primitiis montium orientis, et de pretiosis collium  
    saeculi; et de pretiosis terrae et plenitudinis ejus; et      beneplacitum habitantis in rubo; venient capiti Josephi, et      vertici naziraei fratrum illius, Deut. xxxiii 13-17.  (m)Quia per 
`Israelem' repraesentatur Ecclesia spiritualis Domini, n. 3305, 3654, idcirco Jacob tunc Israel ante mortem suam, dixit ad Josephum,      Duo filii tui, qui nati sunt tibi in terra Aegypti, antequam  
    ego veniens ad te in Aegyptum, mei erunt Ephraim et Menasheh,      sicut Reuben et Shimeon:... angelus qui redemit me ex omni      malo, benedicat pueris, ut vocetur in iis nomen meum, et nomen  
    patrum meorum, Abrahami et Jishaki, et crescant in      multitudinem in medio terrae, Gen. xlviii 5, 16; </p>
<p>sunt enim duo quae constituunt Ecclesiam spiritualem, intellectuale et voluntarium; 
intellectuale est quod repraesentatur per `Ephraim,' et voluntarium quod per `Menasheh'; inde patet cur duo Josephi filii a Jacobo tunc Israele adoptati sunt et agniti pro suis; Ephraim etiam in 
Verbo imprimis prophetico saepius nominatur, et ibi per illum significatur intellectuale veri et boni, quod est Ecclesiae spiritualis(n): [9] apud Ezechielem,      Jehovah dixit, Fili hominis, sume 
tibi lignum unum, et scribe      super illud Jehudae et filiis Israelis sociis ejus; et sume      lignum unum, et scribe super illud Josepho, lignum Ephraim, et      omnis domus Israelis sociorum 
ejus; et conjunge illa, unum ad      alterum tibi in lignum unum, ut sint unum ambo in manu      {10}mea;... sic dixit Dominus Jehovih, Ego, ecce Ego accipiens      lignum Josephi, quod in manu Ephraimi 
et tribuum Israelis,      sociorum ejus, et addam illos super ligno Jehudae, et faciam      eos in lignum unum, et erunt unum in manu Mea;... et faciam      eos in gentem unam in terra, in montibus 
Israelis; et rex unus      erit omnibus illis in regem, et non erunt amplius duae gentes,      et non dividentur amplius in duo regna iterum, xxxvii 16, 17,      19, 22; </p>
<p>agitur ibi de regno 
Domini caelesti et spirituali, regnum caeleste est `Jehudah,' n. 3654, 3881, 3921 f.; regnum spirituale est `Josephus,' et quod regna illa non duo erunt sed unum; facta etiam sunt in unum per Adventum 
Domini in mundum; [10] quod per Adventum Domini salvati sint spirituales, videatur n. 2661, 2716, 2833, 2833; illi sunt de quibus Dominus loquitur apud Johannem,      Et alias oves habeo, quae 
non sunt ex ovili hoc; etiam illas      oportet Me adducere, vocemque Meam audient, et fiet unus grex      et unus pastor, x 16; </p>
<p>id est quod significatur per `duo ligna,' nempe Jehudae et Josephi, quae 
conjungentur in unum, et erunt unum in manu Domini et sicut in gentem unam, sunt etiam unum in regno Domini; caelestes enim constituunt caelum tertium quod est intimum, spirituales autem caelum 
secundum quod est interius, ac ibi sunt unum, quia influit unum in alterum, nempe caeleste in spirituale; est spirituale regnum sicut planum caelesti, ita constabilita sunt; Divinum enim caeleste 
in tertio seu intimo caelo est amor in Dominum, caeleste spirituale ibi est charitas; haec, nempe charitas, est principale in secundo caelo seu interiore ubi spirituales sunt, inde patet qualis 
influxus, et quoque qualis per influxum constabilitio; </p>
<p>(m)`lignum' significat bonum, tam bonum amoris in Dominum, quam bonum charitatis erga proximum n. 2784, 2812, 3720, ideo mandatum ut scriberentur 
Jehudah et Josephus super lignis, quae unum {11}fierent(n): [11] apud Zachariam,      Potentem faciam domum Jehudae, et domum Josephi salvabo et      habitare faciam illos, quia misertus illorum, 
et erunt      quemadmodum non reliquissem illos, quia Ego Jehovah Deus      illorum et respondebo illis, x 6; </p>
<p>ibi etiam de binis regnis, nempe caelesti et spirituali, agitur, caeleste regnum est 
`Jehudah,' et spirituale est `Josephus'; deque salvatione spiritualium: [12] apud Amos,      Sic dixit Jehovah domui Israelis, Quaerite Me et vivetis,...      quaerite Jehovam, et vivetis, ne invadat 
sicut ignis domum      Josephi, et comedat, et nemo exstinguens;... odio habete      malum, et diligite bonum, et stabilite in porta judicium,      forte miserebitur Jehovah Deus Zebaoth reliquiarum 
Josephi, v      4, 6, 15; </p>
<p>ibi etiam spirituales per `Josephum' significantur; (m)`domus {12}Israelis' est Ecclesia spiritualis, n. 3305, 3654, `Josephus' est bonum illius Ecclesiae, quare 
dicitur `dixit Jehovah domui Israelis, Quaerite Me et vivetis, ne invadat sicut ignis domum Josephi(n): [13] apud Davidem,      Pastor Israelis, adverte aurem, ducens sicut gregem Josephum,      insidens 
cherubis, effulge coram Ephraim, et Benjamin, et      Menasheh, excita potentiam Tuam, et ito in salvationem nobis,      Ps. lxxx (x)2, 3 [A.V. 1, 2]; </p>
<p>similiter, ibi etiam `Josephus' est homo 
spiritualis, `Ephraim, Benjamin et Menasheh' sunt tria quae illius Ecclesiae sunt: [14] apud eundem,      Extollite cantum, et date tympanum, citharam amoenam cum      nablio, clangite in mense 
buccina, in feria ad diem festi      nostri, quia statutum Israeli hoc, judicium Deo Jacobi,      testimonium {13}Jehosepho posuit illud, in exeundo illo contra      terram Aegypti; labium non noveram 
audivi, Ps. lxxxi 3-6 [A.      V. 2-5]; </p>
<p>quod `Jehosephus' hic sit spiritualis Ecclesia seu spiritualis homo, a singulis verbis et vocibus ibi patet, sunt enim voces in Verbo quae spiritualia 
exprimunt, et sunt voces quae caelestia, et hoc constanter ubivis, hic sunt voces quae spiritualia, ut `cantus, tympanum, cithara cum nablio, clangere in mense buccina, in feria ad diem festi,' inde 
quoque patet quod de spirituali Ecclesia quae est `Josephus,' agatur: [15] apud Ezechielem,      Sic dixit Dominus Jehovih, Hic terminus ad quem hereditabitis      terram, juxta duodecim tribus Israelis, 
Josepho funes,      (x)xlvii 13; </p>
<p>ibi de regno spirituali Domini agitur, quare dicitur `Josepho funes.' Divinum Spirituale Domini est quod etiam vocatur regium Ipsius, nam regium Domini est 
Divinum Verum, at sacerdotale Ipsius est Divinum Bonum, n. 2015, 3009, 3670; ipsum regium Domini est quod repraesentatur per `Josephum,' quod rex factus in terra Aegypti, de qua repraesentatione, 
ex Divina Domini Misericordia, ibi.  [16] Quod Divinum Spirituale Domini, seu Divinum Verum, attinet, quod per `Josephum' in supremo sensu repraesentatur, id non est in Domino, sed a Domino, Dominus 
enim non est nisi Divinum Bonum, sed a Divino Bono procedit Divinum Verum; se habet hoc comparative sicut sol et ejus lux; in sole non est lux, sed {14}procedit a sole, seu sicut ignis; in igne 
non est lumen sed lumen procedit ab igne; Ipsum Divinum Bonum etiam in Verbo comparatur soli, tum igni, et quoque vocatur sol et ignis; regnum caeleste Domini vivit ex bono quod procedit a Domino, 
regnum autem spirituale a vero inde, quapropter Dominus in altera vita apparet caelestibus ut Sol, at spiritualibus ut Luna, videatur n. 1053, 1521, 1529-1531, 3636, 3643; est enim calor et est lux 
quae procedunt a sole; calor comparative est bonum amoris, quod etiam calor caelestis et spiritualis vocatur, lux comparative est verum inde, quod quoque lux spiritualis dicitur, videatur n. 3636, 
3643, sed calori caelesti et luci spirituali qua procedunt a Domino ut a sole in altera vita, inest bonum amoris et verum fidei, ita sapientia et intelligentia, n. 1521-1523, 1542, 1619-1632, 2776, 3138, 
3190, 3195, 3222, 3223, 3339, 3485, 3636, 3643, 3862; quae enim a Domino procedunt, sunt viva; [17] inde constare potest quid Divinum Spirituale est, et unde regnum spirituale, et regnum caeleste, 
et quod regnum spirituale sit bonum fidei, hoc est, charitas, quae influit a Domino immediate, et quoque mediate per regnum caeleste.  Divinum Spirituale, (m)quod (t)a Domino procedit, in 
Verbo vocatur Spiritus veritatis estque sanctum verum, et non est alicujus spiritus, sed est Domini, per spiritum a Domino missum, ut constare potest ab Ipsius Domini verbis, apud Johannem,      Quando 
venerit Ille, Spiritus veritatis, ducet vos in omnem      veritatem, non enim loquetur a Se Ipso, sed quaecumque      audiverit, loquetur, {15}Ille etiam futura annuntiabit vobis: </p>
<p>     Ille Me
