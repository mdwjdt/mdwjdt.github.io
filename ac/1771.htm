<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1771.</strong>还有些灵人不相信主圣言的核心或内在蕴含这类事物。因为在来世，灵人会秉持他们在肉身时就有的类似不信。这种不信只能藉由主提供的方法和活生生的经验被驱散。鉴于此，当我在阅读大卫诗篇的某些章节时，这些灵人更深层次的视觉或心智被打开了；这些特殊的灵人没有被提到天使灵当中。我在阅读的时候，他们便觉察到这些诗篇所蕴含的圣言内在事物，并对它们感到万分惊奇，声称他们原先从不相信这类事物。<br />这时，其他很多灵人也听到这部分圣言，但对它的理解各不相同。对有些灵人来说，它以快乐怡人的感觉和取决于各自接受能力的生命充满他们的思想观念。同时，它还以穿透其至内在的影响力充满他们。而对其中一些灵人来说，这种力量如此巨大，以致他们觉得自己正朝着天堂的内在部分被提升，越来越接近主，不过，这各自取决于他们对真理和与真理结合的良善的情感程度。<br />与此同时，圣言还被带到一些对圣言内义毫无概念，只懂得外在意义或字义的灵人面前；在他们看来，文字似乎没有任何生命可言。由此明显可知，当主赋予圣言生命，也就是说，圣言具有穿透人至内在的影响力时，它是何性质；以及当主不赋予它生命，也就是说，圣言除了文字外几乎没有任何生命时，它又是何性质。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1771.</strong> Still another group of spirits had difficulty believing that the Lord's Word conceals these kinds of depths within, at its heart. (In the other life spirits keep the skepticism they had when they lived in their bodies; it is not broken down except through means provided by the Lord and through personal experience.) Accordingly, the inner eye of their mind was opened while I was reading some of David's psalms, although these spirits were not lifted up to join angelic spirits. They perceived the inner dimensions of the Word in the psalms I was reading and, stunned by them, confessed that they had never believed in such things.<br />[2] Many other spirits then listened to the same part of the Word, but they all perceived it in different ways. It filled the thoughts of some with many sweet, pleasant images and so with a kind of life, according to the capacity of each. It also had the strength to pierce through to their deepest core. With some its power was so great that they seemed to themselves to be lifted up toward the more inward parts of heaven. The more they were affected by its truth — and by the goodness interwoven with the truth — the closer they came to the Lord.<br />[3] At the same time the Word was read to some who grasped none of its inner meaning but only its outer or literal meaning. In their eyes, the letter was lifeless.<br />This showed what the Word is like when the Lord brings it to life and when he does not. When he does, it has the power to penetrate to our inmost core; when he does not, it is mere words, with hardly any life in it. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1771</b></p><p><b>1771.</b>
Certain spirits also were in unbelief concerning the Word of the Lord, as to there being such things stored up in its bosom, or within it; for in the other life spirits are in unbelief like that in which 
they had been in the life of the body; and this is not dissipated except by means provided by the Lord, and by living experiences. On this account, while I was reading some of the Psalms of David, 
the deeper insight or mind of these spirits was opened. These were not taken up among angelic spirits. They then perceived the interior things of the Word in those Psalms; and being amazed at them said 
that they had never believed such things.  [2] The same portion of the Word was then heard by many other spirits; but they all apprehended it in different ways. With some it filled the ideas of their 
thought with many pleasant and delightful things, thus with a kind of life in accordance with the capacity of each one, and at the same time with an efficacy that penetrated to their inmosts, and 
this to such a degree with some that they seemed to be uplifted toward the interiors of heaven, and nearer and nearer to the Lord, according to the degree in which they were affected by the truths and 
the goods therewith injoined.  [3] The Word was then at the same time brought to some who had no apprehension of its internal sense, but only of the external or literal sense; and to them the letter 
appeared to have no life. From all this it was manifest what the Word is when the Lord fills it with life-that it is of such efficacy that it penetrates to the inmosts; also what it is when He does 
not fill it with life-that it is then the letter only, with scarcely any life. </p>

There were also certain spirits who did not believe that the Word of the Lord concealed such things in its bosom, that is, inwardly; for in the next life spirits retain a similar unbelief to that which 
they had when they were in the body. Such unbelief is not dispelled except by means which the Lord provides, and by living experiences. Consequently while I was reading some of the Psalms of David 
their interior sight or mind was opened; these particular spirits were not raised up among the angelic spirits. As I was reading they perceived the interior things of the Word which are present in those 
psalms, and astonished by those things they said that they had never believed such. </p>

 At that time this same part of the Word was heard by many other spirits, but these all grasped it in different 
ways. With some it filled the ideas comprising their thought with many lovely and delightful feelings, and so with a kind of life - with each one according to his capacity to receive it. At the same 
time it filled them with an effecting power that penetrated to their inmost being. With some that power was so great that it seemed to them that they were being raised up towards the interior parts 
of heaven, and nearer and nearer the Lord - each according to the degree of his affection for truths, and for the goods joined to the truths. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Also at that same time the Word was brought to some 
spirits who had no conception of an internal sense of the Word, but only of an external or literal sense, to whom the letter did not seem to possess any life. From all this it was clear what the Word 
is like when the Lord imparts life to it, namely that it possesses such an effecting power that it penetrates to people's inmost being; also what it is like when He does not impart life to it, namely 
nothing but the letter possessing scarcely any life at all. </p>

</p><b>1771.</b>
Quidam spiritus etiam in incredulitate erant de Verbo Domini quod talia in sinu seu intus reconderet; sunt enim spiritus in simili incredulitate in altera vita in qua fuerunt in vita corporis, quae non 
dissipatur quam per media a Domino provisa et per vivas experientias; quare cum legerem aliquos psalmos Davidis, interior eorum intuitio seu mens aperiebatur; hi non sublati sunt inter spiritus angelicos; 
tunc interiora Verbi in psalmis illis percipiebant, quibus obstupefacti dicebant quod talia nusquam crediderint.  [2] Auditum tunc fuit Verbum hoc a pluribus aliis spiritibus, sed qui omnes capiebant 
illud cum diversitate; apud quosdam implebat cogitationis illorum ideas pluribus amoenis et jucundis, ita quadam vita, secundum cujusvis capacitatem, et simul efficacia penetrante ad illorum intima; 
apud quosdam tanta ut visi sibi versus interiora caeli elevari, ac propius et propius ad Dominum, secundum gradus quo vera et veris injuncta bona afficerent.  Ad quosdam tunc simul allatum est 
Verbum, qui nihil de sensu interno Verbi capiebant, sed solum de sensu externo seu litterali, quibus apparebat littera nullius vitae: inde constabat quale Verbum cum Dominus vivificat illud, quod illius 
efficaciae sit ut penetret ad intima, et quale cum non vivificat, quod tunc solum littera sit, vix ullius vitae. </p>
