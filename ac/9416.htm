<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9416节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9416.</strong>“我要将石版赐给你”表律法书，或整体上的圣言。这从“石版”的含义清楚可知，“石版”是指写有教义和生活的事务，此处即天上的教义和照之的生活事务的物体。这些石版之所以表示律法书，也就是整体上的圣言，是因为写在它们上面的东西以一种总体的方式涵盖了属于天上生活和教义的一切事务。这也解释了为何刻写在它们上面的东西被称为“十句话”（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.28.htm">34:28</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申10.4.htm">10:4</a>）；因为“十”在内义上表示全部或一切；“话”表示教义的真理和生活的良善。“十”表示全部或一切（参看<a href="3107.htm">3107</a>，<a href="4638.htm">4638</a>，<a href="8468.htm">8468</a>，<a href="8540.htm">8540</a>节），“话”表示生活和教义的真理和良善（参看<a href="1288.htm">1288</a>，<a href="4692.htm">4692</a>，<a href="5272.htm">5272</a>节）。这就是为何这些石版表示整体上的圣言，和律法一样；律法在严格意义上表示刻写在这两块石版上的东西，在不怎么严格的意义上表示通过摩西所写的圣言，在广泛意义上表示圣言的历史部分，在最广泛的意义上表示整体上的圣言（参看<a href="6752.htm">6752</a>节）。此外，刻在这两块石版上的东西属于揭示神性真理的第一个阶段；它们也被主在以色列众民面前以一种活生生的声音宣告出来。属于第一个阶段的东西表示在其适当秩序中的其它一切事物；这些事物被主以一种活生生的声音宣告出来表示也在揭示的所有其它阶段中的直接神性启示。这两块石版之所以由石头制成，是因为“石头”表示真理（<a href="643.htm">643</a>，<a href="1298.htm">1298</a>，<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>，<a href="6426.htm">6426</a>节），准确地说，表示真理的最低层（<a href="8609.htm">8609</a>节）。神之真理的最低层构成诸如存在于地球上的圣言文字（<a href="9360.htm">9360</a>节）。<br />石版不是一块，而是两块，是为了代表主通过圣言而与教会，并通过教会而与人类的结合。这也是为何它们还被称为“立约的版”（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申9.9.htm">9:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申9.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申9.15.htm">15</a>）；又为何刻在上面的话被称为“约的话”（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.27.htm">34:27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.28.htm">28</a>），也被称为“约”（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申4.13.htm">4:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申4.23.htm">23</a>）；放有石版的约柜本身被称为“约柜”（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民10.33.htm">10:33</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民14.44.htm">14:44</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申10.8.htm">10:8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申31.9.htm">31:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申31.25.htm">25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申31.26.htm">26</a>；约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书3.3.htm">3:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/书3.6.htm">6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/书3.8.htm">8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/书3.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/书3.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/书3.17.htm">17</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/书4.7.htm">4:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/书4.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/书4.18.htm">18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/书6.6.htm">6:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/书6.8.htm">8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/书8.33.htm">8:33</a>；士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士20.27.htm">20:27</a>；撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上4.3.htm">4:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上4.5.htm">5</a>；撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下15.24.htm">15:24</a>；列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上3.15.htm">3:15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上6.19.htm">6:19</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上8.1.htm">8:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上8.6.htm">6</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶3.16.htm">3:16</a>）；因为“约”表示结合（<a href="665.htm">665</a>，<a href="666.htm">666</a>，<a href="1023.htm">1023</a>，<a href="1038.htm">1038</a>，<a href="1864.htm">1864</a>，<a href="1996.htm">1996</a>，<a href="2003.htm">2003</a>，<a href="2021.htm">2021</a>，<a href="6804.htm">6804</a>，<a href="8767.htm">8767</a>，<a href="8778.htm">8778</a>，<a href="9396.htm">9396</a>节）。这解释了为何这两块石版是分开的，然而却通过并排放置而被联结在一起；写在它们上面的文字不断从这块石版传到那块石版，就像写在一块石版上的文字；而不是如人们通常所想的那样，有些诫命写在这一块石版上，有些诫命写在那一块石版上。因为一个物体被一分为二，然后这两个部分联在一起起，或并排放置，就表示主与人的结合。因此，约的建立以同样的方式实现；如与亚伯拉罕立约是通过母牛犊、母山羊、公绵羊，每样从中间劈成两半，一半对着另一半摆列（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创15.9.htm">15:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创15.12.htm">12</a>）；在本章（24:6，8），还通过血盛在盆中，一半洒在祭坛上，一半洒在百姓身上；一般通过一切祭物，一半烧在祭坛上，一半给百姓吃。约的建立还由主擘开饼来代表（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太14.19.htm">14:19</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太15.36.htm">15:36</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.26.htm">26:26</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可6.41.htm">6:41</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/可8.6.htm">8:6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/可14.22.htm">14:22</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.16.htm">9:16</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.19.htm">22:19</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.30.htm">24:30</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.35.htm">35</a>）。也正因如此，在圣言中，“二”表示结合（<a href="5194.htm">5194</a>，<a href="8423.htm">8423</a>节），在此是指主与天堂，或主与教会的结合，因而也指良善与真理的结合，该结合被称为天上的婚姻。由此可见为何有两块石版，又为何它们是两面写的，这面那面都有字（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出32.15.htm">32:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出32.16.htm">16</a>）。<br />此外，在圣言中，在石版上“写”和“刻”表示那些必须铭刻在人们的记忆和生活中，因而必须留在那里的事物；如在下列经文：<br />在他们面前将这话写在版上、记在书上，以便传留后世，直到永永远远。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.8.htm">30:8</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />犹大的罪，是用铁笔、用金钢钻记录的，铭刻在他们的心版上和你们的坛角上。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶17.1.htm">17:1</a>）<br />哈巴谷书：<br />耶和华说，将异象写下来，使它清清楚楚在版上，让快跑的人也读得来。因为这异象有一定的日期，虽然迟延，还要等候；因为它必临到。（哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈2.2.htm">2:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈2.3.htm">3</a>）</p>

And I will give thee the tables of stone. That this signifies the book of the law, or the Word in the whole complex, is evident from the signification of "the tables," as being that whereon were written 
the things which are of doctrine and of life, here the things which are of heavenly doctrine and of a life in accordance therewith. That these tables signify the book of the law, that is, the Word 
in the whole complex, is because the things which were inscribed on them contained in general all things that belong to heavenly life and doctrine. Wherefore also those things which were inscribed on 
them are called "the ten words" (Exod. 34:28; Deut. 10:4); for by "ten" in the internal sense are signified all; and by "words" are signified the truths of doctrine, and the goods of life. (That "ten" 
denotes all, see n. 3107, 4638, 8468, 8540; that "words" denote the truths and goods of life and doctrine, n. 1288, 4692, 5272.) For this reason these tables signify the Word in the whole complex; in 
like manner as the law, which in a close sense signifies what was inscribed on these tables; in a less close sense the Word written by Moses; in a wide sense the historic Word; and in the widest sense 
the Word in its whole complex; as may be seen above (n. 6752). Moreover, the things inscribed on these tables were the first of the revelation of Divine truth, and were proclaimed by the Lord before 
all the people of Israel with a living voice. The things which are first signify all the rest in their order; and their being proclaimed by the Lord with a living voice signifies immediate Divine inspiration 
in the rest also. The reason why these tables were of stone was that "stone" signifies truth (n. 643, 1298, 3720, 6426), properly truth in ultimates (n. 8609); truth Divine in ultimates is the 
Word in the letter, such as it is on this earth (n. 9360).  [2] The reason why there was not one table, but two, was that there might be represented the conjunction of the Lord through the Word with 
the church, and through the church with the human race. Therefore they are also called "the tables of the covenant" (Deut. 9:9, 11, 15); and the words inscribed are called "the words of the covenant" 
(Exod. 34:27, 28), and also "the covenant" (Deut. 4:13, 23); and the ark itself, in which the tables were placed, was called "the ark of the covenant" (Num. 10:33; 14:44; Deut. 10:8; 31:9, 25, 26; 
Josh. 3:3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17; 4:7, 9, 18; 6:6, 8; 8:33; Judges 20:27; 1 Sam. 4:3-5; 2 Sam. 15:24; 1 Kings 3:15; 6:19; 8:1, 6; Jer. 3:16); for a "covenant" denotes conjunction (n. 665, 666, 1023, 1038, 
1864, 1996, 2003, 2021, 6804, 8767, 8778, 9396). Wherefore these tables were divided the one from the other; but were joined together by attachment; and the writing was continued from one table on to 
the other, as though it was upon one table; but not according to the common opinion, some commandments upon one table, and some upon the other. For by one being divided into two, and by the two being 
thus joined together, or placed beside each other, is signified the conjunction of the Lord with man. For this reason covenants were entered into in a similar way; as with Abraham by a she-calf, a she-goat, 
and a ram divided in the middle, and by one part being placed opposite the other (Gen. 15:9-12); in this chapter also by the blood being put in basins, and half of it being sprinkled on the altar, 
and half upon the people (verses 6, 8); and in general by all the sacrifices, a part of which was burnt upon the altar, and a part was given to the people to eat. The like was also represented by 
the breaking of bread by the Lord (Matt. 14:19; 15:36; 26:26; Mark 6:41; 8:6; 14:22; Luke 9:16; 22:19; 24:30, 35). Hence also it is that by "two" in the Word is signified conjunction (n. 5194, 8423), 
here, that of the Lord and heaven, or of the Lord and the church, thus also of good and truth, which conjunction is called the heavenly marriage. From this it can be seen why there were two tables, and 
why they were written on the two sides, on the one side and on the other (Exod. 32:15, 16). [3] Moreover, "writing" and "engraving" on "tables" signify in the Word those things which must be impressed 
on the memory and on the life, and which are therefore to be lasting; as in the following passages: </p>
<p>     Write it before them on a table, and impress it on a book, that it may be for the latter day 
forever even to eternity (Isa. 30:8).      The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, with a point of a diamond; it is graven upon the table of their heart, and upon the horns of your altars 
(Jer. 17:1).      Jehovah said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it. For the vision is yet for the appointed time; though it tarry, wait for it; because coming 
it will come (Hab. 2:2-3). </p>

'And I will give you tablets of stone' means the book of the law, or the Word in its entirety. This is clear from the meaning of 'tablets' as objects on which matters of doctrine and life have been inscribed, 
in this instance matters of heavenly doctrine and of life in keeping with it. The reason why those tablets mean the book of the law or the Word in its entirety is that the things which had been 
inscribed on them contained in a general way all matters of life and of that heavenly doctrine. This also explains why the things inscribed on them are called the ten words, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2034:28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 34:28</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2010:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 10:4</a>. 
For 'ten' in the internal sense means all, and 'words' means truths that are matters of doctrine and forms of good that are matters of life. For the meaning of 'ten' as all, see <a href="3107.htm">3107</a>, <a href="4638.htm">4638</a>, <a href="8468.htm">8468</a>, <a href="8540.htm">8540</a>, 
and for that of 'words' as truths and forms of good that are matters of life and doctrine, <a href="1288.htm">1288</a>, <a href="4692.htm">4692</a>, <a href="5272.htm">5272</a>. This is why those tablets mean the Word in its entirety, just as the Law does, which in 
a restricted sense means the things which had been inscribed on those tablets, in a less restricted sense the Word that was written through Moses, in a broad sense the historical section of the Word, 
and in the broadest sense the Word in its entirety, see what has been shown in <a href="6752.htm">6752</a>. Furthermore the things which had been inscribed on those tablets belonged to the first stage in the revelation of 
Divine Truth; they were also declared in actual words uttered by the Lord before all the Israelite people. What belongs to the first stage means all the rest in their proper order; and the fact that 
those things were declared in actual words uttered by the Lord means direct Divine inspiration in all other stages of revelation as well. The reason why those tablets were made of stone was that 'stone' 
means truth, <a href="643.htm">643</a>, <a href="1298.htm">1298</a>, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>, <a href="6426.htm">6426</a>, the lowest levels of truth, to be exact, <a href="8609.htm">8609</a>. The lowest levels of God's truth constitute the letter of the Word as it exists on this planet, <a href="9360.htm">9360</a>.  </p>

 There 
was not one tablet but two, to represent the joining of the Lord to the Church through the Word, and through the Church to the human race. This also is why they are called the tablets of the covenant, 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%209:9,%2011,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 9:9, 11, 15</a>, and why the words inscribed on them are called the words of the covenant, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2034:27,%2028&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 34:27, 28</a>, also the covenant, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%204:13,%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 4:13, 23</a>. And the ark itself in which the tablets had been deposited 
was called the ark of the covenant, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2010:33;%2014:44&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 10:33; 14:44</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2010:8;%2031:9,%2025,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 10:8; 31:9, 25, 26</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%203:3,%206,%208,%2011,%2014,%2017;%204:7,%209,%2018;%206:6,%208;%208:33&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 3:3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17; 4:7, 9, 18; 6:6, 8; 8:33</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%2020:27;%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 20:27; 1</a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Sam%204:3-5;%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Sam 4:3-5; 2</a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Sam%2015:24;%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Sam 15:24; 1</a> Kings 3:15; 6:19; 8:1, <a href="6.htm">6</a>; Jer. 3:16. For a covenant is a joining together, <a href="665.htm">665</a>, <a href="666.htm">666</a>, <a href="1023.htm">1023</a>, <a href="1038.htm">1038</a>, <a href="1864.htm">1864</a>, <a href="1996.htm">1996</a>, <a href="2003.htm">2003</a>, <a href="2021.htm">2021</a>, <a href="6804.htm">6804</a>, <a href="8767.htm">8767</a>, <a href="8778.htm">8778</a>, <a href="9396.htm">9396</a>. This explains why those tablets were divided from each other yet were 
joined together by being laid alongside each other. The writing on them ran across continuously from one tablet onto the other, like the writing on a single tablet. It was not, as people ordinarily think, 
that some commandments were written on one tablet and some on the other. For a single object divided in two, and the two parts then brought together or given each to the other, means the Lord and 
man joined together. The establishment of covenants was therefore accomplished in similar ways, that with Abraham for example by parting down the middle a heifer, she-goat, and ram, and laying each 
part opposite the other, Gen. 15:9-12; in verses 6 and <a href="8.htm">8</a> of the present chapter by putting blood in bowls and then sprinkling it half over the altar and half over the people; and generally in all sacrifices 
by burning one part on the altar and giving the other part to the people to eat. The like was also represented by the Lord when He broke bread, Matt. 14:19; 15:36; 26:26; Mark 6:41; 8:6; 14:22; 
Luke 9:16; 22:19; 24:30, <a href="31.htm">31</a>, <a href="35.htm">35</a>. Here also is the reason why 'two' in the Word means things joined together, <a href="5194.htm">5194</a>, <a href="8423.htm">8423</a>, here the Lord and heaven, or the Lord and the Church, joined together, thus also 
goodness and truth joined together, which is called the heavenly marriage. From all this it becomes clear why it is that there were two tablets and that both sides of them were written on, from edge 
to edge, Exod. 32:15, <a href="16.htm">16</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Furthermore when the writing and engraving on tablets is mentioned in the Word it means those things that must be imprinted in people's memory and on their life, and 
so remain there, as in Isaiah,  </p>
<p>Write it on a tablet among them, and express it in a book,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> so that it may be for time to come forever, even to eternity. Isa. 30:8.  </p>
<p>In Jeremiah,  </p>
<p>The sin of 
Judah has been written with a pen of iron; with a point of diamond it has been engraved on the tablet of their heart, and at the horns of your altars. Jer. 17:1.  </p>
<p>In Habakkuk,  </p>
<p>Jehovah said, Write 
the vision, and make it plain on tablets, that one running by may read it. For the vision is yet for an appointed time; if it tarries, wait for it, because it will surely come. Hab. 2:2, <a href="3.htm">3</a>.

omnia quae vitae et doctrinae {2}caelestis sunt; quapropter etiam dicuntur illa quae eis inscripta sunt, decem verba, Exod. xxxiv 28; Deut. x 4; per `decem' enim in sensu interno significantur omnia, 
et per `verba' significantur vera quae doctrinae et bona quae vitae; quod `decem' sint omnia, videatur n. 3107, 4638, 8468, 8540, et quod `verba' sint vera et bona quae sunt vitae et doctrinae, n. 1288, 
4692, 5272; inde est quod illae tabulae significent Verbum in omni complexu; similiter ac Lex, quae in stricto sensu significat illa quae illis tabulis inscripta erant, in sensu minus stricto, Verbum 
{3}per Moschen scriptum, in lato sensu, Verbum historicum, et in latissimo, Verbum in toto complexu, ut ostensum videatur n. 6752; (m)praeterea quae tabulis illis inscripta erant fuerunt primum revelationis 
Divini Veri, et coram omni populo Israelitico viva voce a Domino enuntiata; quae primum sunt significant reliqua in ordine, et quod illa viva voce a Domino enuntiata fuerint, significat inspirationem 
{4}immediatam Divinam etiam in reliquis.(n) Quod tabulae illae ex lapide fuerint, causa erat quia `lapis' significat verum, n. 643, 1298, 3720, 6426, proprie verum in ultimis, n. 8609; verum 
Divinum in ultimis est Verbum in littera, quale in hac tellure, n. 9360. Quod non una tabula, sed binae {5}fuerint, erat ut repraesentaretur 2 conjunctio Domini per Verbum cum Ecclesia, et per Ecclesiam 
cum (t)humano genere; ideo quoque vocantur tabulae foederis, Deut. ix 9, 11, 15; ac verba inscripta verba foederis, Exod. xxxiv 27, 28; et quoque foedus, Deut. iv 13, 23; ac ipsa arca, in qua tabulae 
repositae erant, arca foederis, Num. x 33, xiv 44; Deut. x 8, xxxi 9, 25, 26; Josuae iii 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, iv 7, 9, 18, vi 6, 8, viii 33; Jud. xx 27; 1 Sam. iv 3-5; 2 Sam. xv 24; 1 Reg. (x)iii 
15, vi 19, viii 1, 6; Jer. iii 16; foedus enim est conjunctio, n. 665, 666, 1023, 1038, 1864, 1996, 2003, 2021, 6804, 8767, 8778, 9396; quapropter tabulae illae inter se divisae erant, sed per applicationem 
conjunctae, (c)et scriptura ab una tabula in alteram, sicut super una, continuata; non autem secundum opinionem vulgarem, quaedam praecepta super tabula una et quaedam super altera; -{6}per unum 
enim divisum in duo, et per haec duo ita conjuncta, aut data uni et alteri, significatur conjunctio Domini cum homine; foedera ideo simili modo (x)inibantur, ut cum Abrahamo per `vitulam, capram, et 
arietem, partitos in medium, et per unam partem positam obviam alteri,' Gen. xv 9-12; {7}etiam in hoc capite per `sanguinem positum in crateribus, et dimidium ejus sparsum super altare, et dimidium 
super populum,' vers. 6 et 8; et in genere per omnia sacrificia, quorum pars adolebatur super altari, pars dabatur populo ad comedendum; simile etiam repraesentabatur per fractionem panis a Domino, Matth. 
xiv 19, xv 36, xxvi 26; Marc. vi 41, viii 6, xiv 22; Luc. ix 16, xxii 19, xxiv 30, 31, 35; inde quoque est quod `duo' in Verbo significent conjunctionem, n. 5194, 8423, hic quae est Domini et caeli, 
seu Domini et Ecclesiae, ita quoque boni et veri, quae conjunctio vocatur conjugium caeleste.  Ex his constare potest unde est quod tabulae binae fuerint, et a duobus lateribus hinc illinc scriptae, 
Exod. xxxii 15, 16. Praeterea scriptura et sculptura super tabulis in Verbo significat 3 illa quae memoriae et vitae impressa erunt, et sic permansura, ut apud Esaiam, Scribe id super tabula apud 
illos, et super libro exprime illud, ut sit in diem posterum in perpetuum, usque in aeternum, xxx 8: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam, Peccatum Jehudae scriptum est stylo ferri; scalpro adamantis. sculptum est super 
tabula cordis eorum, et ad cornua altarium vestrorum, xvii 1: </p>
<p>apud Habakuk, Jehovah dixit, Scribe visionem, et explica super tabulis, ut percurrat legens illam; quia adhuc visio in tempus constitutum; 
si moratur, exspecta illum, quia veniendo veniet, ii 2, 3. @1 continerent$ @2 essent$ @3 quod per Moschen scriptum est$ @4 similem$ @5 essent$ @6 per unum divisum in duo, ac per haec duo ita 
conjuncta in unum, significabatur conjunctio Domini cum homine, quapropter foedera simili modo inchoantur$ @7 After the Scripture references in line 24.$ </p>
