<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1588节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1588.</strong>“那地如同耶和华的园子”表外在人中的理性事物。这从“耶和华的园子”的含义清楚可知：“耶和华的园子”表聪明（参看<a href="100.htm">100</a>节），因而表理性，理性是内在人与外在人之间的媒介。理性是外在人的聪明。若理性是属天的，即来自一个属天源头，它就被称为“耶和华的园子”，如上古教会的情形。对此，以赛亚书上是这样描述的：<br />耶和华已经安慰锡安和锡安一切的荒场，使旷野像伊甸，使沙漠像耶和华的园子；在其中必有欢喜、快乐、感谢和歌唱的声音。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛51.3.htm">51:3</a>）<br />然而，若理性是属灵的，即它来自一个属灵的源头，如古教会的情形，就采用“神的园”这种说法。如以西结书：<br />智慧充足，全然美丽，你曾在伊甸，神的园中。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.12.htm">28:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.13.htm">13</a>）<br />人的理性好比园子，因为这就是它在天堂所呈现的代表形像。当属天-属灵之物从主流入人的理性时，它就显为一个园子；甚至天堂花园也由此呈现于视野，其辉煌美丽超过人类的所有想象，这是属天-属灵之光从主流入的效果（对此，参看<a href="1042.htm">1042</a>，<a href="1043.htm">1043</a>节）。振奋情感的，并非这些花园中可爱、美丽之物，而是存活在它们里面的属天-属灵之物。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1588.</strong> Like the garden of Jehovah symbolizes the rational ideas of the outer self. This can be seen from the symbolism of Jehovah's garden as intelligence (discussed in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1588/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_100" target=_top>100</a>) and so as the rational plane, which is midway between the inner self and the outer. The rational plane is the same thing as the intelligence of the outer self.<br />The term garden of Jehovah is used when our rational mind is heavenly, or when it comes from a heavenly origin, as it did in the people of the earliest church. Isaiah speaks of it this way:<br />Jehovah will comfort Zion, he will comfort all its wastelands, and he will make its wilderness like Eden and its desert like a garden of Jehovah. Joy and gladness will be found in it; acclamation and the voice of song. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1588/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_51_3" target=_top>Isaiah 51:3</a>)<br />The term garden of God, on the other hand, is used when our rational mind is spiritual, or when it comes from a spiritual origin, as it did in the people of the ancient church. Ezekiel speaks of it this way:<br />You were full of wisdom and perfect in beauty in Eden, the garden of God. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1588/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_28_12-13" target=_top>Ezekiel 28:12-13</a>)<br />Human rationality is compared to a garden because of a representative type of garden that appears in heaven. Human rationality is what presents itself in this way and no other, when something heavenly and spiritual from the Lord acts on it. In fact it even presents the sight of lush parks whose magnificence and beauty exceed anything the human imagination can invent. This is the effect that results when heavenly-spiritual light flows in from the Lord, as mentioned before in 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1588/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1042" target=_top>1042</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1588/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1043" target=_top>1043</a>. It is not the pleasures and beauties themselves of these parks that touch the heart but the heavenly-spiritual entities alive inside them. </p>

Like the garden of Jehovah. That this signifies its rational things, is evident from the signification of "the garden of Jehovah," as being intelligence (see n. 100), and consequently the rational, which 
is the medium between the internal and the external man. The rational is the intelligence of the external man. The expression "garden of Jehovah" is used when the rational is celestial, that is, 
from a celestial origin, as it was with the Most Ancient Church, concerning which in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah will comfort Zion; He will comfort all her waste places, and will make her wilderness as Eden, 
and her desert as the garden of Jehovah; joy and gladness shall be found in her, confession and the voice of a song (Isa. 51:3). But the expression "garden of God" is used when the rational is spiritual, 
that is, from a spiritual origin, as it was in the Ancient Church, spoken of in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty, thou hast been in Eden the garden of God (Ezek. 28:12-13). Man's 
rational is compared to a "garden," from the representative that is presented in heaven; it is man's rational that appears as a garden when the celestial spiritual flows into it from the Lord; 
and even paradises are from this presented to the sight, which in magnificence and beauty surpass every idea of human imagination, which is the effect of the influx of celestial spiritual light from the 
Lord (spoken of before, n. 1042, 1043). The pleasant and the beautiful things of these paradises are not what affect the beholder, but the celestial spiritual things that live in them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1588</b></p><p><b>1588.</b>
'Like the garden of Jehovah' means the rational concepts in the external man. This is clear from the meaning of 'the garden of Jehovah' as intelligence, dealt with in <a href="100.htm">100</a>, consequently the rational which 
comes in between the internal man and the external man. The rational is intelligence as it exists in the external man. It is called 'the garden of Jehovah' when the rational is celestial, that is, 
when it has a celestial origin, as was the case with the Most Ancient Church. This is described in Isaiah as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah will comfort Zion, He will comfort all her waste places, and will make 
her wilderness like Eden and her desert like the garden of ]Jehovah. Joy and gladness will be found in her, confession and the voice of song. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2051:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 51:3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>When however the rational is spiritual, that 
is, when it has a spiritual origin, as was the case with the Ancient Church, the expression 'the garden of God' is used, as in Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty, you were in Eden, the 
garden of God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2028:12,13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 28:12,13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>A person's rational is compared to a garden because this is how it is represented in heaven. It is man's rational that manifests itself in just this way when that 
which is celestial-spiritual flows into it from the Lord. Indeed it is this which presents to view the paradise gardens whose magnificence and beauty surpass everything the human mind can imagine. This 
is the effect which the influx of celestial-spiritual light from the Lord produces, as dealt with already in <a href="1042.htm">1042</a>,<a href="1043.htm">1043</a>. It is not the loveliness and beauty of these gardens that stir the emotions but 
the celestial-spiritual elements that live within them. </p>

Quod 'sicut hortus Jehovae' significet ejus rationalia, constat a significatione 'horti Jehovae' quod sit intelligentia, de qua n. 100, proinde rationale quod medium est inter hominem internum et externum; 
rationale est hominis externi intelligentia; 'hortus Jehovae dicitur' cum rationale caeleste est, hoc est, ex origine caelesti, ut fuit apud Antiquissimam Ecclesiam, de quo ita apud Esaiam, 	Consolabitur 
Jehovah Zionem, consolabitur omnes vastitates illius, et ponet desertum illius tanquam Eden, et solitudinem illius sicut Hortum Jehovae; gaudium et laetitia invenietur in ea, confessio et 
vox cantus, li 3; </p>
<p>at 'Hortus Dei' dicitur cum rationale est spirituale, hoc est, ex origine spirituali, ut apud Ecclesiam Antiquam, de quo apud Ezechielem, 	Plenus sapientia, et perfectus pulchritudine, 
in Eden Horto Dei fuisti, xxviii (x)12, 13. Rationale hominis comparatur horto ex repraesentativo quod sistitur in caelo; est rationale hominis, in quod cum influit caeleste spirituale a Domino, 
quod non aliter apparet; immo etiam inde sistuntur visibiles paradisi quae omnem imaginationis humanae ideam magnificentia et pulchritudine excedunt, quod est effectus influxus lucis caelestis spiritualis 
a Domino, de quo prius n.  1042, 1043; nec sunt amoenitates et pulchritudines paradisiacae quae afficiunt, sed sunt caelestia spiritualia quae in illis vivunt. </p>
