<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>561.</strong>但何为余留？它们不仅指人从小自主的圣言那里学习并刻在记忆里的善与真，而且还包括源于此的所有状态，如小时候的纯真状态；爱父母、兄弟、老师、朋友的状态；对邻仁爱的状态，以及怜恤贫寒和穷乏之人的状态；总之，所有善与真的状态。这些状态，连同刻在记忆里的善与真就是所谓的余留，它们被主保存在人内，并储存在他的内在人里，然而，人自己对此毫不知情。这些余留与人自己的东西，即恶与假完全隔绝。所有这些状态在人内被主保存得如此完好，以至于丝毫未丢失。我从以下事实得以知道这一点，即从襁褓中的婴儿直到风烛残年，人的一切状态不但被带到来生（灵界），还会再现。事实上，这些状态和他在世时的状态完全一样。不仅记忆里的善与真是这样，而且纯真与仁爱的状态也是这样。当恶与假，或邪恶与错误观念的状态复发时（这些东西的每一个，直至最小细节也被带到来生并再现），主就用善的状态节制它们。从所有这一切明显可知，人若没有余留，必将遭受永恒的诅咒（参阅<a href="468.htm">468</a>节）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]561.</strong> To explain what a remnant is: It is not just the good and true things that we learn out of the Lord's Word from the time we are small and that become stamped on our memory. It is also all the states that rise out of those things, such as a state of innocence from babyhood, a state of love for our parents, siblings, teachers, and friends, a state of charity toward our neighbor and compassion toward the poverty-stricken and needy. In short, it is all states of goodness or truth.<br />These states, along with the good and true things imprinted on our memory, are called a remnant. The Lord preserves them in us, hiding them away in our inner being without our slightest awareness and carefully separating them from the things that are our own — in other words, from evil and falsity.<br />The Lord preserves all these states in us in such a way that not even the least significant of them is lost. This I learned from the fact that every one of our states from infancy to extreme old age not only remains in the other life but even returns. When we relive them, they are identical to the experience we first lived through in the world. This happens not only with the good and true things etched on our memory but also with any state of innocence or charity we have experienced. In addition, each and every one of our states of evil and falsity (or malice and delusion) remains and returns as well, in all its minutest detail. And when the latter states come back to us, the Lord tempers them by means of the former. All of which shows that if we had no remnant, we could not help being damned for eternity (see above at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_561/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_468" target=_top>468</a>). </p>

But what are remains? They are not only the goods and truths that a man has learned from the Lord's Word from infancy, and has thus impressed on his memory, but they are also all the states thence derived, 
such as states of innocence from infancy; states of love toward parents, brothers, teachers, friends; states of charity toward the neighbor, and also of pity for the poor and needy; in a word, 
all states of good and truth. These states together with the goods and truths impressed on the memory, are called remains, which are preserved in man by the Lord and are stored up, entirely without his 
knowledge, in his internal man, and are completely separated from the things that are proper to man, that is, from evils and falsities. All these states are so preserved in man by the Lord that not 
the least of them is lost, as I have been given to know from the fact that every state of a man, from his infancy to extreme old age, not only remains in the other life, but also returns; in fact his 
states return exactly as they were while he lived in this world. Not only do the goods and truths of memory thus remain and return, but also all states of innocence and charity. And when states of evil 
and falsity recur-for each and all of these, even the smallest, also remain and return-then these states are tempered by the Lord by means of the good states. From all this it is evident that if a man 
had no remains he must necessarily be in eternal damnation. (See what was said before at n. 468.) </p>

But what are remnants? Not only the goods and truths which one has learned from the Word of the Lord from early childhood onwards and so had imprinted in his memory, but also all resulting states, such 
as states of innocence from early childhood; states of love towards parents, brothers and sisters, teachers, and friends; states of charity towards the neighbour, and also of compassion on the poor 
and needy; in short, all states involving good and truth. These states, together with the goods and truths that have been imprinted in the memory, are called remnants, which the Lord preserves with a 
person and stores away in his internal man, though the person himself is not at all directly conscious of this. Here they are separated completely from the things that are the person's own, that is, 
evils and falsities. The Lord so preserves all of those states with the individual that not even the least of them perishes. I have been given to know this from the fact that every one of man's states 
from his infancy right through to extreme old age not only carries over into the next life but also reappears. Indeed those states are exactly the same as when he lived in the world. Thus not only are 
goods and truths in the memory carried over, but also all states of innocence and charity. And when states of evil and falsity, or wickedness and false notions, recur - for every single one of these 
as well, down to the smallest detail, is carried over and reappears - they are at that time moderated by the Lord through those states of innocence and charity. From all this it becomes clear that if 
a person possessed no remnants, he would inevitably be subject to eternal condemnation. See what has appeared already in <a href="468.htm">468</a>.  </p>

</p><b>561.</b>
Sed ut sciatur quid 'reliquiae'; sunt non solum bona et vera quae ex Verbo Domini homo usque ab infantia didicit, et sic memoriae ejus impressa; sed etiam sunt omnes status inde, sicut status innocentiae 
ab infantia, status amoris erga parentes, fratres, instructores, amicos; status charitatis erga proximum, ut et misericordiae erga pauperes et egenos; verbo omnes status boni et veri: hi status 
cum bonis et veris memoriae impressis dicuntur reliquiae, quae a Domino apud hominem conservantur et reconduntur in interno ejus homine, illo prorsus nesciente, et separantur probe ab iis quae sunt hominis 
propria, seu mala et falsa: omnes illi status ita conservantur a Domino apud hominem ut ne minimum illorum pereat; quod scire mihi datum ex eo quod unusquisque status hominis ab infantia ejus usque 
ad ultimam senectam, in altera vita non solum remaneat sed etiam redeat, et quidem prorsus ita sicut fuerunt dum vixit in mundo; ita non solum bona et vera memoriae sed etiam status innocentiae et 
charitatis omnes; et quando status mali et falsi, seu malitiae et phantasiae, recurrunt, qui etiam omnes et singuli quoad omnia minima remanent et redeunt, tunc a Domino hi status per illos temperantur; 
ex quibus constare potest, si homo nullas reliquias haberet, quod nusquam posset aliter quam in damnatione aeterna se; videantur quae prius, n. 468. </p>
