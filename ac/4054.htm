<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4054节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4054.</strong>脑就像天堂，属于系功用的目的领域；因为凡从主流入的，都是关注人类救赎的目的。这就是在天上掌权，并由此同样在脑中掌权的目的；因为人的心智所在的脑关注身体中的目的，以便身体能服务于灵魂，而灵魂能成为永恒的幸福。但有些社群并没有着眼于任何功用的目的，只是男女朋友混在一起，在那里享乐；因此他们完全是自我放纵，除了自己外不关心任何人。无论在家里还是在公共场合，他们的目的都是那样。如今，这类灵人所组成的社群之多，超乎任何人的想象。他们一靠近，其气场就开始运转，并摧毁其他人里面对真理与良善的情感。一旦这些情感被毁，这些灵人便体验其友谊的快乐。<br />这些就是脑中的堵塞物，他们在那里引发愚蠢行为。由这类灵人组成的许多社群与我同在，我通过一种迟钝、呆滞和情感的丧失察觉到他们的临在。我还与他们交谈过几次。他们就是害虫和祸根，尽管他们在世上的日常生活中，一直表现得良善、迷人，彬彬有礼，富有才华；因为他们知道如何行事得体，如何由此渗入进来，尤其渗入友情。至何谓好朋友，或什么才是好的友谊，他们既不知道，也不想知道。悲惨的命运正等着他们。结局是：他们活在肮脏中，并且活在如此的愚蠢中，以致在他们身上，人类理解事物的能力几乎毫无存留。因为正是目的构成人，目的如何，此人便如何；因而他死后的人类理解能力就如何。</p>

The brain, like heaven, is in the sphere of ends which are uses; for whatever flows in from the Lord is an end looking to the salvation of the human race. This end is that which reigns in heaven, and 
thereby reigns likewise in the brain; for the brain, which is where the mind is, looks to ends in the body, in order that the body may subserve the soul, so that the soul may be happy to eternity. But 
there are societies that have no end or purpose of use, except to be among friends, male and female, and to have pleasures there, thus seeking their own gratification only, and making much of themselves 
exclusively, whether at home or publicly, it being all for the same end. Of such spirits there are at this day more societies than anyone could believe. As soon as they approach, their sphere begins 
to work, and extinguishes in others the affections of truth and good; and when these have been extinguished, then these spirits are in the pleasures of their friendship.  These are the obstructions 
of the brain, and induce on it stupidity. Many societies of such spirits have been with me, and their presence was perceived by a dullness, sluggishness, and loss of affection; and I have sometimes 
spoken with them. They are pests and banes, although in the civic life of this world they had appeared good, delightful, witty, and also talented; for they  know the proprieties of society, and how to 
insinuate themselves thereby, especially into friendships. What it is to be a friend to good, or what the friendship of good is, they neither know, nor desire to know. A sad lot awaits them; for at 
last they live in squalor, and in such stupidity that scarcely any human apprehension remains. For it is the end that makes the man, and such as is the end, such is the man; consequently such is his human 
after death. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4054</b></p><p><b>4054.</b>
The brain, like heaven, belongs to the realm of ends which are uses, for whatever flows in from the Lord is an end looking towards the salvation of the human race. This is the end which reigns in heaven, 
and also which as a result reigns in the brain, for the brain, where man's mind is seated, looks to ends in the body, that is to say, so that the body may serve the soul and that the soul may be 
eternally happy. But some communities exist which have no end that has any use in view apart from mixing with friends, male and female, and enjoying themselves there; thus they are wholly self-indulgent 
and care about no one else but themselves. Whether at home or in public their end in view is the same. More communities of spirits such as these exist at the present day than one can possibly imagine. 
As soon as they arrive their sphere gets to work and destroys in others their affections for truth and good. And once these have been destroyed those spirits experience the delight which they share 
as friends with one another. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 These are obstructions in the brain, and they cause nonsensical confusions there. Many communities of such spirits have been with me, and I have perceived their presence 
from a dullness, slowness, and loss of emotional feeling. I have also talked to them on several occasions. They are pestilential and pernicious, though in everyday life when they were in the world 
they had apparently been good, pleasant, well-mannered, and also clever people, for they know how to behave correctly and how to worm their way in by such behaviour, especially into friendships. 
What is meant by being a friend to good, or by the friendship that is concerned for what is good, they neither know nor wish to know. A sad fate awaits them. In the end they live in squalor and in such 
stupidity that scarcely anything at all of their human ability to understand things is left to them. For the end he has in view is what makes a person, and the essential nature of his end determines 
the nature of him as a person and therefore of his human ability to understand after death. </p>

Cerebrum sicut caelum est in sphaera finium qui sunt usus, quicquid enim influit a Domino, est finis spectans generis humani salvationem; hic finis est qui regnat in caelo, et quoque qui inde regnat 
in cerebro, cerebrum enim ubi mens hominis, spectat fines in corpore, ut nempe corpus inserviat animae, ut anima sit felix in aeternum.  At dantur societates quae nullum finem usus habent, solum ut inter 
amicos et amicas sint, et ibi in voluptatibus, ita qui solis sibi indulgent, et solam pelliculam curant, si forte domestica aut si publica, sunt pro eodem fine; talium spirituum societates hodie 
plures sunt quam usquam credi potest; illi ut primum alluunt, sphaera eorum operatur, et apud alios exstinguit affectiones veri et boni, quae cum exstinctae sunt, tunc illi in suae amicitiae voluptate 
sunt: illi sunt obstipationes cerebri, et stupiditates ei inducunt: talium societates {1}plures apud me fuerunt, et perceptum ab hebetudine, lentore, et privatione affectionis, quod adessent; et {2}aliquoties 
etiam cum illis locutus sum: sunt pestes et pernicies, tametsi in vita civili cum fuerunt in mundo, apparuerint sicut boni, (t)jucundi, faceti, et quoque ingeniosi, nam decora sciunt ac insinuationes 
per illa, imprimis in amicitias; quid amicus esse bono, seu amicitia boni, non sciunt, nec scire volunt; sors illos tristis manet; vivunt demum in squalore, et in tali stupiditate ut vix aliquid 
humani quoad captum illis residuum sit: finis enim facit hominem, et qualis finis talis homo, proinde tale humanum (c)ei post mortem. </p>
