<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9141节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9141.</strong>“在别人的田地造成荒凉”表吞噬相互关联的良善。这从“荒凉”和“在别人的田地”的含义清楚可知：“荒凉”是指通过恶欲剥夺，因而吞噬，如下文所述；“在别人的田地”是指相互关联的良善。“田地”表示教会，田里的庄稼表示良善（参看<a href="9139.htm">9139</a>节）；因此，“在别人田地”里的庄稼表示彼此相邻并相互关联的良善。因为与人同在的良善就像地上的世代，因而在亲近度和关联性上各不相同（<a href="9079.htm">9079</a>节）。那些不在同一个屋檐下，或不在同一个家庭里，然而仍有联系的良善，就是“在别人的田地”所表示的。<br />“荒凉”之所以表示通过恶欲剥夺，从而吞噬，是因为在原文，用来指“荒凉”的那个词本义是指放火烧，因而也指吃和吞噬。由于这就是这个词的由来，所以此处“造成荒凉”表示通过恶欲所造成的吞噬；因为一个人里面的恶欲就是吞噬的火。每个人里面都有生命之火和生命之光；生命之火是他的爱，生命之光就是他的信。对良善的爱，也就是对主之爱和对邻之爱，构成一个善人和一位天堂天使里面的生命之火；对真理的爱和对真理的信则构成他们里面的生命之光。但对邪恶的爱，也就是对自我的爱和对世界的爱，则构成一个恶人和一个地狱灵里面的生命之火；对虚假的爱和信则构成他们里面的生命之光。然而，在圣言中，对邪恶的爱被称为“燃烧的火”，因为它燃烧并吞噬那些属于对良善和真理的爱之物。“燃烧的火”就具有这种含义（参看<a href="1297.htm">1297</a>，<a href="1861.htm">1861</a>，<a href="5215.htm">5215</a>，<a href="9055.htm">9055</a>节）。<br />在原文，这个词就表示通过恶欲吞噬，这一点从以下经文明显看出来：<br />耶和华必审判祂民中的长老和首领；你们吞噬（放火烧了）葡萄园。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛3.14.htm">3:14</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />耶和华的气如一股硫磺吞噬它（或使它燃起）。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.33.htm">30:33</a>）<br />“一股硫磺”表示从自我之爱和世界之爱中流出的虚假（<a href="2446.htm">2446</a>节）。<br />以西结书：<br />以色列城的居民必出去点火烧武器，就是小盾大牌、弓箭、梃杖、枪矛；用它们来烧火，直烧七年，甚至他们不必从田野捡柴，也不必从森林伐木。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结39.9.htm">39:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结39.10.htm">10</a>）<br />这段经文如此描述了通过恶欲对良善和真理的吞噬和荒凉。不过，若不知道“以色列城的居民”表示什么，以及“武器”、“小盾”、“大牌”、“弓箭”、“梃杖”、“枪矛”、“七年”、“田野的柴”和“森林的木”表示什么，谁会明白这一切？“居民”是指良善（参看<a href="2268.htm">2268</a>，<a href="2451.htm">2451</a>，<a href="2463.htm">2463</a>，<a href="2712.htm">2712</a>节）；“城”是指真理，因而指取自圣言的教义事物（<a href="2268.htm">2268</a>，<a href="2449.htm">2449</a>，<a href="2943.htm">2943</a>，<a href="3216.htm">3216</a>，<a href="4492.htm">4492</a>节）；“以色列”是指教会（<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>，<a href="6426.htm">6426</a>，<a href="6637.htm">6637</a>节）。因此，“以色列城的居民”是指教会教义事物的良善；在反面意义上是指那些已经变成邪恶和虚假的事物。“小盾”、“大牌”和“弓箭”是指取自圣言的教义真理，它们用来保护，以免受邪恶所生虚假的伤害（参看<a href="2686.htm">2686</a>，<a href="2709.htm">2709</a>，<a href="6421.htm">6421</a>节）；“梃杖”是指源于良善的真理的能力（<a href="4876.htm">4876</a>，<a href="7026.htm">7026</a>节）；“枪矛”同样表示能力，不过是更内在的能力；“七年”是指一个完全的状态，因而是指完全（<a href="6508.htm">6508</a>，<a href="8976.htm">8976</a>节）；因此，“烧火，直烧七年”是指通过恶欲完全吞噬；“田野的柴”是指教会的内层良善（<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>，<a href="8354.htm">8354</a>节）；“田野”是指教会（<a href="2971.htm">2971</a>，<a href="3766.htm">3766</a>，<a href="7502.htm">7502</a>，<a href="7571.htm">7571</a>节）；“森林的木”是指外层良善（<a href="3220.htm">3220</a>，<a href="9011.htm">9011</a>e节）。知道这一切，就能知道上面这些预言描述了通过恶欲对教会一切事物的吞噬，直到内在和外在教会的良善和真理荡然无存，这由他们“烧火，直烧七年，甚至他们不必从田野捡柴，也不必从森林伐木”来表示。<br />在玛拉基书，同样的话还描述了对教会的良善和真理的吞噬：<br />万军之耶和华说，看哪，那日临近，燃烧如火炉，一切狂傲的和一切行恶的，都必成碎秸；那要来的日子，必把他们吞噬（烧尽），不给他们留下一根一枝。（玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛4.1.htm">4:1</a>）<br />“要来的日子”是指教会的末期，这时对自我和世界的爱将掌权，并吞噬教会的一切真理和良善，直到人的内在和外在里面无一物幸存。这些事由“不给他们留下一根一枝”来表示；良善的和真理的“根”存在于人的内在里面，“枝”存在于他的外在里面。由此明显可知，“荒凉”表示通过恶欲吞噬，在圣言的其它地方也一样。</p>

And it shall desolate in the field of another. That this signifies the consuming of the cohering goods, is evident from the signification of "to desolate," as being to deprive through cupidities, thus 
to consume (of which below); and from the signification of "in the field of another," as being the cohering goods; for "a field" denotes the church, and the things in a field denote goods (see n. 9139); 
thus those which are "in the field of another," denote the adjacent goods which cohere; for the goods with man are like generations on the earth, and consequently are in various degrees of nearness 
and coherence (n. 9079). Those which are not in the same house, or together in the same family, but yet are related, are what are meant by being "in the field of another." [2] That "to desolate" denotes 
to deprive through cupidities, and thus to consume, is because by the word which is used in the original tongue for "to desolate" is properly signified to set on fire and burn, thus also to feed 
on and consume. And as this is the derivation of the word, "to desolate" here signifies the consuming that is done by cupidities; for the cupidities in a man are consuming fires. There is in man the 
fire of life, and the light of life. The fire of life is his love, and the light of life is his faith. The love of good (that is, love to the Lord and love toward the neighbor) makes the fire of life 
in a good man and in an angel of heaven; and the love of truth and the faith of truth make the light of life in them. But the love of evil (that is, the love of self and the love of the world) makes 
the fire of life in an evil man and in a spirit of hell; and the love and faith of what is false make the light of life in them. But the love of evil is called in the Word the "burning of fire," because 
it burns and consumes those things which belong to the love of good and truth. (That the "burning of fire" has this signification, see n. 1297, 1861, 5215, 9055.) [3] That a consuming by cupidities 
is signified by this word in the original tongue, is plain from the following passages: </p>
<p>Jehovah will come into judgment with the elders of His people, and the prices thereof. Ye have consumed [set 
fire to] the vineyard (Isa. 3:14). The breath of Jehovah, like a river of sulphur, doth consume [burn] it (Isa. 30:33);  "a river of sulphur" denotes falsities from the evils of the love of self and 
the love of the world (n. 2446). [4] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     The inhabitants of the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both shield and buckler, with bow and with 
arrows, and with hand staff and with spear, and they shall kindle a fire with them seven years, that they shall bring no wood out of the field, nor cut down any out of the forests (Ezek. 39:9-10); </p>
<p>thus 
is described the consuming and desolating of good and truth through cupidities. But who will see this, unless he knows what is signified by "the inhabitants of the cities of Israel," also what by "weapons," 
"shield," "buckler," "bow with arrows," by "hand staff and spear," by "seven years," and by "wood out of the field, and out of the forests." (That "inhabitants" denote goods, see n. 2268, 2451, 
2463, 2712; that "cities" denote truths, and consequently doctrinal things from the Word, n. 2268, 2449, 2943, 3216, 4492; and that "Israel" denotes the church, n. 4286, 6426, 6637.) Consequently 
"the inhabitants of the cities of Israel" denote the goods of the doctrinal things of the church; and in the opposite sense, these goods turned into evils and falsities. (That "shield," "buckler," and 
"arrows of the bow" denote truths of doctrine from the Word, whereby there is protection from the falsities of evil, see n. 2686, 2709, 6421; that a "hand staff" denotes the power of truth from good, 
n. 4876, 7026; in like manner a "spear," but interior power; that "seven years" denote a full state, thus to the full, n. 6508, 8976; thus "to kindle a fire for seven years" denotes to consume to the 
full through cupidities; "wood out of the field" denotes the interior goods of the church, n. 3720, 8354; "field" being the church, n. 2971, 3766, 7502, 7571; and "wood out of the forests," exterior 
goods, n. 3220, 9011.) When these things are known it may be known that by the above prophecies is described the consuming of all things of the church through cupidities until nothing of the good and 
truth of the internal and external church remains, which is signified by "they shall kindle a fire for seven years, so that they shall bring no wood out of the field, nor cut down any out of the forests." [5] 
By the same expression is also described the consuming of the good and truth of the church, in Malachi: </p>
<p>     Behold the day cometh, burning as an oven, wherein all that sin proudly, and every 
worker of wickedness, shall be stubble; and the day that cometh shall consume [kindle] them, said Jehovah Zebaoth, which shall leave them neither root nor branch (Mal. 4:1); </p>
<p>"the day that cometh" 
denotes the last time of the church, when the loves of self and of the world shall reign, and shall consume all the truths and goods of the church, until nothing survives in the man's internal and external, 
which is signified by "shall leave them neither root nor branch." The "root" of good and truth is in man's internal, and the "branch" is in his external. From this then it is evident that "to desolate" 
signifies to consume through cupidities, as is the case elsewhere in the Word. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9141</b></p><p><b>9141.</b>
'And causing devastation in another's field' means consuming interconnected forms of good. This is clear from the meaning of 'devastating' as a stripping away, thus a consuming, by evil desires, dealt 
with below; and from the meaning of 'in another's field' as interconnected forms of good. 'Field' means the Church, and the crop in the field means forms of good, <a href="9139.htm">9139</a>, so that the crop 'in another's 
field' means forms of good which are adjacent and interconnected with one another. For the forms of good present with a person are like generations on earth, and therefore stand at different distances 
from one another and vary in their interconnections, <a href="9079.htm">9079</a>. Those that are not in the same household or together in the same family, but are nevertheless related, are what 'being in another's field' 
is used to mean.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why 'devastating' means a stripping away, and so a consuming, by evil desires is that the proper meaning of the actual word used in the original language to denote 
'devastating' is setting alight and burning, and so also feeding on and consuming. And since this is what the word is derived from, 'causing devastation' here means consuming, which is done by evil desires; 
for evil desires in a person are consuming fires. There is present in everyone the fire of life and the light of life; the fire of life is his love, and the light of life is his belief. The love 
of good, that is, love to the Lord and love towards the neighbour, compose the fire of life in a good person and in an angel of heaven, and the love of truth and belief in truth compose the light of 
life in them. But the love of evil, that is, self-love and love of the world, compose the fire of life in a bad person and in a spirit in hell, and the love of falsity and belief in falsity compose 
the inferior light of life in them. In the Word however the love of evil is called a burning fire, because it burns up and consumes those things that are forms of the love of good and truth. For this 
meaning of a burning fire, see <a href="1297.htm">1297</a>, <a href="1861.htm">1861</a>, <a href="5215.htm">5215</a>, <a href="9055.htm">9055</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The fact that a consuming by evil desires is meant by the actual word used in the original language is evident from the following places: 
In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah will enter into judgement with the elders of His people and with their princes. You have consumed (set alight) the vineyard. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%203:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 3:14</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
The breath 
of Jehovah like a river of brimstone consumes it (sets it  on fire). <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2030:33&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 30:33</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'A river of brimstone' means falsities streaming from the evils of self-love and love of the world, <a href="2446.htm">2446</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
In Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
The inhabitants of the cities of Israel will go out, and they will set alight and burn the weapons, both shield and buckler, together with bow and arrows, and hand-staff, and spear; they 
will set fire to them for seven years, that they may not bring wood from the field nor cut down any from the forests. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2039:9,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 39:9, 10</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This serves to describe the consumption and devastation of 
good and truth by evil desires. But is anyone going to recognize this unless he knows what is meant by the inhabitants of the cities of Israel, also what is meant by weapons, shield, buckler, bow and 
arrows, by hand-staff and spear, by seven years, and by wood from the field and from the forests? 'The inhabitants' are forms of good, see <a href="2268.htm">2268</a>, <a href="2451.htm">2451</a>, <a href="2712.htm">2712</a>; 'the cities' are truths, and therefore matters 
of doctrine drawn from the Word, <a href="2268.htm">2268</a>, <a href="2449.htm">2449</a>, <a href="2943.htm">2943</a>, <a href="3216.htm">3216</a>, <a href="4492.htm">4492</a>; and 'Israel' is the Church, <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>, <a href="6426.htm">6426</a>, <a href="6637.htm">6637</a>. Therefore 'the inhabitants of the cities of Israel' are forms of good that belong to matters 
of doctrine taught by the Church, and in the contrary sense these things when they have been turned into evils and falsities. 'Shield', 'buckler', and 'the bow's arrows' are truths belonging to 
religious teachings drawn from the Word, which serve to protect against falsities arising from evil, <a href="2686.htm">2686</a>, <a href="2709.htm">2709</a>, <a href="6422.htm">6422</a>. 'Hand-staff' is the power of truth derived from good, <a href="4876.htm">4876</a>, <a href="7026.htm">7026</a>;<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and 'spear' in 
like manner means power, though that which is more internal. 'Seven years' is a complete state, thus to completeness, <a href="6508.htm">6508</a>, <a href="8976.htm">8976</a>, so that 'setting fire to for seven years' is a complete consumption by 
evil desires. 'Wood from the field' is the Church's more internal forms of good, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>, <a href="8354.htm">8354</a>, 'the field' being the Church, <a href="2971.htm">2971</a>, <a href="3766.htm">3766</a>, <a href="7502.htm">7502</a>, <a href="7571.htm">7571</a>; and 'wood from the forests' is more external forms 
of good, <a href="3220.htm">3220</a>, <a href="9011.htm">9011</a> (end). When aware of all this a person can then know that these words spoken by the prophet describe the consuming of all things of the Church by evil desires, until none at all of 
the internal or of the external Church's good or truth is left, meant by 'they will set fire to them for seven years, that they may not bring wood from the field nor cut down any from the forests'.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
A further use of the same word to describe the consumption of the Church's good and truth occurs in Malachi,  </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, the day is coming, burning like an oven, in which all who are sinning insolently, 
and everyone who performs wickedness, will be stubble; and the day that is coming will consume (set fire to) them, said Jehovah Zebaoth, who will leave them neither root nor branch. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mal%204:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mal 4:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The day that is coming' is the final period of the Church, when self-love and love of the world are going to reign and to consume all the Church's truths and forms of good, until none at all is 
left in a person inwardly or outwardly. These things are meant by the statement that 'He will leave them neither root nor branch'; 'the root' of good and truth exists in a person inwardly, and 'the branch' 
in him outwardly. From all this it is now evident that 'devastating' means a consuming by evil desires, in the same way as it does elsewhere in the Word.
