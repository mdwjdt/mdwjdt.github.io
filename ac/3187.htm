<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3187节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3187.</strong>“愿你的种得着那仇恨你之人的城门”表主的属灵国度源于神性人中良善与真理的婚姻，该国度拥有仁与信，那里原先是恶与假所在之处。这从前面的阐述和解释（<a href="2851.htm">2851</a>节）清楚可知，那里有几乎相同的话。“种”表那些被称为属灵的之人，因而从普遍意义上说，表构成主的属灵国度的所有人，或也可说，表该国度本身。这从“种”的含义明显看出来，“种”是指仁与信（参看<a href="1025.htm">1025</a>，<a href="1447.htm">1447</a>，<a href="1610.htm">1610</a>，<a href="1940.htm">1940</a>节），因此是指那些通过信而处于仁的人。这些人是属灵的（参看<a href="2088.htm">2088</a>，<a href="2184.htm">2184</a>，<a href="2507.htm">2507</a>，<a href="2708.htm">2708</a>，<a href="2715.htm">2715</a>，<a href="2954.htm">2954</a>节），拥有从主的神性人中良善与真理的婚姻而来的仁与信，从而拥有由此而来的救恩（<a href="2661.htm">2661</a>，<a href="2716.htm">2716</a>，<a href="2833.htm">2833</a>，<a href="2834.htm">2834</a>节）。<br />在古教会，这句话，即“愿你的种得着那仇恨你（或你的仇敌）之人的城门”是衷心祝愿的习惯用语，是说给即将结婚的订了婚的少女的。但古教会的智者通过这句话来理解属灵事物。也就是说，对他们来说，这句话的意思是：当人们步入良善与真理的婚姻时，即他们一旦重生，良善与真理就会结实千万，也就是无限量结实；还有一个意思是：仁与信会取得原先恶与假所占据的位置。然而，当古教会的智慧灭亡后，他们就不再以属灵的方式，而完全以世俗的方式来理解这句习惯用语。也就是说，这句话的意思变成：他们会有无数后代，这些后代会占有和得着外邦人的土地。比起其他人，雅各的后代尤其如此理解这句话，并因以下事实而确信应当这样理解，即：他们不仅明显增多，而且还得了土地；对他们来说，这土地就是“他们仇敌的城门”。殊不知，所有这些事都是代表，就是主的属天和属灵国度的代表。因此，逐出恶与假之后，善与真便取而代之。蒙主怜悯，等到解释这些代表时，这一点会变得尤为清晰。<br />具体来说，也就是对成为主国度的每个个体来说，情况也是这样：在他成为这个国度，即重生之前，他里面无非是恶与假。事实上，地狱和恶魔般的灵人就占据那被称为“城门”的（对此，参看<a href="2851.htm">2851</a>节）。但当他正在成为主的国度，即正在重生时，恶与假，或也可说，地狱和恶魔般的灵人就被赶出去，而善与真则进来，并接过那地方。此时，对善与真的良知就存在于他里面。适用于具体的个人的，也适用于总体上的人们。由此明显可知，上面那些话在内义表示什么。</p>

And may thy seed inherit the gate of those that hate thee. That this signifies the Lord's spiritual kingdom derived from the marriage of good and truth in the Divine Human, to which kingdom pertain charity 
and faith where before were evil and falsity, may appear from what was said and explained above (n. 2851), where nearly the same words occur. That "seed" denotes those who are called the spiritual, 
thus in the universal sense all who constitute the Lord's spiritual kingdom, or what is the same, that kingdom itself, is evident from the signification of "seed," as being charity and faith (see 
n. 1025, 1447, 1610, 1940), and accordingly those who are in charity through faith (for that these are the spiritual, may be seen above, n. 2088, 2184, 2507, 2708, 2715, 2954; also that these have charity 
and faith from the marriage of good and truth in the Lord's Divine Human, thus that they have salvation therefrom, n. 2661, 2716, 2833, 2834).  [2] In the Ancient Church this was a customary devout 
wish to a betrothed virgin, when she was going to be married: "Be thou for thousands of ten thousands, and may thy seed inherit the gate of thine enemies," or of "them that hate thee;" but the wise 
ones of that church by these words understood spiritual things; namely, that when they entered into the marriage of good and truth, that is, when they were regenerate, then goods and truths would be 
fructified to thousands of ten thousands, that is, immeasurably; and that charity and faith would succeed in the place where evil and falsity were before; but when the wisdom of the Ancient Church expired, 
they then no longer received from this devout wish any spiritual sense, but a wholly worldly sense, namely, that the posterity might be innumerable, and that it might take possession of and inherit 
the land of the Gentiles. Pre-eminently did the descendants of Jacob so understand these words; and they confirmed themselves in so doing by the fact that they not only increased immensely, but 
also inherited the land, which was to them the gate of their enemies; not knowing that all these things were representative, that is, representative of the Lord's celestial and spiritual kingdom, and 
that on the expulsion thence of evils and falsities there would succeed in their place good and truth; which meaning will clearly appear when of the Lord's Divine mercy these representatives are opened. [3] 
In particular, that is, with every man who becomes a kingdom of the Lord, the case also is this: Before he becomes this kingdom, that is, before he is being regenerated, he is inwardly nothing 
but evil and falsity; and infernal and diabolical spirits have possession of that which is called the "gate" (concerning which see n. 2851); but when he is becoming a kingdom of the Lord, that is, when 
he is being regenerated, then evils and falsities, or what is the same, infernal and diabolical spirits, are driven out, and good and truth enter and inherit that place; and then there is in him a 
conscience of good and truth. And as the case is in particular, so also is it in general. From all this it is evident what is meant in the internal sense by the above words. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3187</b></p><p><b>3187.</b>
'And may your seed inherit the gate of those who hate you' means the Lord's spiritual kingdom sprung from the marriage of good and truth in the Divine Human, a kingdom possessing charity and faith where 
evil and falsity had been previously. This becomes clear from what has been stated and explained above in <a href="2851.htm">2851</a> where practically the same words occur. 'Seed' means those who are called spiritual, 
and so in the universal sense means all who constitute the Lord's spiritual kingdom, or what amounts to the same, that kingdom itself. This is clear from the meaning of 'seed' as charity and faith, dealt 
with in <a href="1025.htm">1025</a>, <a href="1447.htm">1447</a>, <a href="1610.htm">1610</a>, <a href="1940.htm">1940</a>, consequently as those in whom charity received through faith is present. These are they who are spiritual, see <a href="2088.htm">2088</a>, <a href="2184.htm">2184</a>, <a href="2507.htm">2507</a>, <a href="2708.htm">2708</a>, <a href="2715.htm">2715</a>, <a href="2954.htm">2954</a>, and to whom charity 
and faith come from the marriage of good and truth in the Lord's Divine Human, and so to whom salvation comes, <a href="2661.htm">2661</a>, <a href="2716.htm">2716</a>, <a href="2833.htm">2833</a>, <a href="2834.htm">2834</a>. </p>

 In the Ancient Church there existed this customary expression 
of a heartfelt desire which was said to a betrothed virgin when about to be married - 'may you become thousands of myriads, and may your seed inherit the gate of your enemies (or those who hate 
you)'. But the wise of that Church understood spiritual things by these words. That is to say, to them that customary expression meant that when people entered into the marriage of good and truth - that 
is, once they were regenerate - goods and truths would become fruitful by thousands of myriads, that is, without end. That expression also meant to them that charity and faith would assume the position 
previously occupied by evil and falsity. But when the wisdom of the Ancient Church died out they no longer understood that customary expression in a spiritual way but in an altogether worldly one. 
That is to say, they meant that they would have countless descendants who would take possession of and inherit the land of the gentile nations. Jacob's descendants more than all others understood the 
expression in this way and convinced themselves that this was how it was to be understood from the fact that they not only did increase enormously but also inherited the land, which to them was 'the 
gate of their enemies'. They did not know that all these things were representatives, that is to say, representatives of the Lord's celestial and spiritual kingdom, and that consequently after the expulsion 
of evils and falsities good and truth took their place. This will be especially clear when, in the Lord's Divine mercy, those representatives are explained.  </p>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 In particular, that is to 
say, with each individual person who becomes the Lord's kingdom, the situation is that before he becomes the kingdom, that is, before he is regenerated, nothing but evil and falsity exists within. Indeed 
hellish and devilish spirits are in possession of that which is called 'the gate', dealt with in <a href="2851.htm">2851</a>. But when he is becoming the Lord's kingdom, that is, being regenerated, evils and falsities, 
or what amounts to the same, hellish and devilish spirits, are driven away from there, and good and truth enter in and inherit that position. A conscience for good and truth is in that case present. And 
what applies to the individual in particular applies also to people in general. This shows what these words are used to mean in the internal sense. </p>

`Et hereditet semen tuum portam osorum{1} tuorum': quod significet regnum spirituale Domini ex conjugio boni et veri in Divino Humano cui regno charitas et fides, ubi prius malum et falsum, constare 
potest ex illis quae supra n. 2851 dicta et explicata sunt, ubi fere eadem verba. Quod `semen' sint illi qui vocantur spirituales, ita in sensu universali omnes qui constituunt regnum spirituale Domini, 
seu quod idem, ipsum illud regnum, constat ex significatione `seminis' quod sit charitas et fides, de qua n. 1025, 1447, 1610, (x)1940, proinde illi qui in charitate sunt per fidem, qui quod sint 
spirituales, videatur n. 2088, 2184, 2507, 2708, 2715, 2954; quod illis charitas et fides ex conjugio boni et veri in Divino Humano Domini, ita illis inde salus, n. 2661, 2716, 2833, 2834. [2] In Ecclesia 
Antiqua erat hoc votivum sollemne virgini desponsatae cum nuptum iret, nempe {2}, `Sis in millia myriadis, et hereditet semen tuum portam hostium seu osorum tuorum'; at sapientes ibi per illa verba 
intelligebant spiritualia, nempe cum intraverint in conjugium boni et veri, hoc est, cum regenerati, quod tunc bona et vera in millia myriadis, hoc est, in immensum fructificarentur; et quod charitas 
et fides succederet loco ubi prius malum et falsum: at vero cum Antiquae Ecclesiae sapientia exspiravit, tunc non amplius sensum spiritualem inde capiebant, sed prorsus mundanum, nempe quod posteritas 
innumerabilis fieret, {3}et illa occuparet et hereditaret terram gentium; Jacobi posteri prae reliquis ita illa intellexerunt, seque confirmabant ex eo quod non solum creverint in immensum, sed etiam 
hereditaverint terram, quae illis erat porta hostium eorum; non scientes quod omnia haec repraesentativa essent, nempe repraesentativa regni caelestis et spiritualis Domini, et quod inde expulsis 
malis et falsis succederent loco eorum bonum et verum; quod luculenter constabit quando, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, repraesentativa illa aperientur: [3] in particulari, nempe apud unumquemvis hominem 
qui fit regnum Domini, ita quoque se habet: is antequam illud (x)fit, seu regeneratur, interius non est nisi malum et falsum, etiam infernales et diabolici spiritus occupant illud quod vocatur `porta,' 
de qua n. 2851; at cum is fit regnum Domini, hoc est, cum regeneratur, tunc mala et falsa, seu quod idem, infernales et diabolici spiritus inde expelluntur, ac intrant {4}bonum et verum, ac locum 
illum hereditant; conscientia (t)boni et veri tunc ibi est: sicut in particulari, ita quoque se habet in communi. Inde nunc patet quid per illa verba in sensu interno {5}intelligitur. @1 Heb-suorum.$
