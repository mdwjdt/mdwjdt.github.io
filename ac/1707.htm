<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1707节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1707.</strong>“亚伯兰听见他兄弟被掳去”表内层人发觉外在人状态的性质。<br />这从“亚伯兰”、“罗得”和“听见他兄弟被掳去”的含义清楚可知：“亚伯兰”是指与内在人或神性人结合的内层人，如前节所述；“罗得”是指外在人，这在前面已说明；“听见他兄弟被掳去”是指发觉其状态的性质，即如12节所述，它被表面的良善与真理所占据。<br />情况是这样：当“希伯来人亚伯兰”所表示的内层人发觉，由此发起争战的良善与真理仅表面上是良善与真理，事实上并不是，而且它们占据了整个外在人（由“他的兄弟，罗得”来表示）时，内层人，确切地说，神性内在人就通过这内层人净化它们。至于如何完成净化，则没人能知道，除非揭示给他。因为内在人通过内层人或中间人流入外在人是一个奥秘。尤其是现在，很少有人知道何为内层人，更不知道何为内在人。从13节可以看出何为内在人，何为内层人。这里只简要说明这种流注的性质。<br />每个人里面的内在人唯独属于主，因为主在那里储存了良善与真理，人自婴儿时主就将它们赐给了他。主经由这些良善与真理从内在人流入内层人或理性人，再由此流入外在人；人以这种方式能够思考，并成为一个人。但从内在人进入内层人或中间人，从而进入外在人的这种流注是双重的；它要么经由属天之物，要么经由属灵之物，或也可说，要么经由良善，要么经由真理。经由属天之物或良善的流注只发生在要么被赋予直觉，要么被赋予良知的重生之人身上；因此，它要么经由直觉，要么经由良知流入。所以，经由属天之物的流注只存在于那些具有对主之爱和对邻之仁的人身上。然而，主经由属灵之物，或真理流入每个人；没有这种流注，人无法思考，因而也无法说话。当人滥用这些良善与真理，毫不关心属天和属灵之物时，就没有属天之物或良善的流注。不过，尽管通向属天之物和良善的道路被关闭，但仍有属灵之物或真理的流注，因为通向它们的道路一直保持开放。由此可见内层人，或中间人，即理性人是何性质。<br />“亚伯兰”在此表示内层人或中间人里面的内在人。当属天之物或良善从内在人流入内层人时，内在人就会使内层人适应自己，并据为己有；然而，内层人或中间人仍有别于内在人。同样，当内在人经由内层人或中间人流入外在人时，它也会使外在人适应自己，并据为己有。然而，这外在人仍有别于内层人。所以，一旦内在人在内层人中发觉，外在人具有这样的状态，也就是说，“它被掳去”意味着占据它的只是表面而非纯正的良善与真理，它通过这些良善与真理和那么多的敌人争战，那么，内在人就会流进来，使一切事物恢复秩序，将外在人从侵扰它的事物中释放出来。内在人相应地净化外在人，也就是说，使它的良善与真理不再是表面的，而是纯正的良善与真理，从而与内在人或神性人结合，实现这种结合要经由内层人，如前所述。<br />在这一点上，主和任何人都不一样，因为就属天之物或良善而言，祂的内层人是神性，并且自出生时就与祂的内在人结合。祂的内在人，连同这内层人就是耶和华祂自己，祂的父。不过，祂在这一点上和其他人一样，即就属灵之物或真理而言，祂的内层人已与祂的外在人结合，因而是人性；不过，这人性凭祂自己的力量通过试探的争战和屡屡得胜而成为神性，即耶和华。被称为“罗得”的，是外在人；但在之前的状态下，这外在人被称为“亚伯兰的侄子”，而在当前状态下，则被称为“亚伯兰的兄弟”。当被表面的良善与真理占据时，它被称为“他的侄子”，而当被纯正的良善与真理占据时，则被称为“他的兄弟”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1707.</strong> Abram heard that his brother had been captured means that his intermediate self sensed what kind of state his outer self was in, as the following shows: Abram symbolizes the Lord's intermediate self linked with his inner, divine self, as mentioned in the last verse [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1707/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1701" target=_top>1701-1702</a>]. Lot symbolizes his outer self, as demonstrated earlier [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1707/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1428" target=_top>1428</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1707/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1547" target=_top>1547</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1707/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1563" target=_top>1563</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1707/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1698" target=_top>1698</a>]. And hearing that his brother had been captured means sensing what kind of state it was in. To be specific, apparent goodness and truth had seized control of it, as noted at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1707/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_12" target=_top>12</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1707/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1698" target=_top>1698</a>].<br />[2] This is the situation: The intermediate self meant by Abram the Hebrew sensed that the goodness and truth being used as weapons were not good and true except in appearance, and that they had seized control of the whole outward self symbolized by Lot, his brother's son. On perceiving this, the intermediate self purified that apparent goodness and truth (or rather the inner, divine self did so, by means of the intermediate self). How this could be done would be a complete mystery to anyone to whom it has not been revealed. After all, the way the inner self acts on the outer by way of the intermediate self is unknown, especially at this day, when few if any realize what the intermediate self is, let alone the inner self. For a description of the inward and intermediate selves, see just above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1707/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_13" target=_top>13</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1707/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1702" target=_top>1702</a>];<br />[3] but here a short explanation of their interaction is needed.<br />In every individual, the inner self belongs to the Lord alone, because that is where he stores up the good impulses and true thoughts that he gives us as gifts from the time we are very small. These are the channel through which he acts on our intermediate, rational self, which in turn is the channel through which he acts on our outward self. In doing so, he makes it possible for us to think and to be human.<br />However, the stream of his influence from the inner self, acting on the intermediate self and through it on the external self, is of two kinds. Either he acts by heavenly means or he acts by spiritual means; to put the same thing another way, he acts either through goodness or through truth. When he operates by way of heavenly qualities, or good impulses, he acts only on those who have been reborn — those endowed with either perception or conscience. Accordingly, this influence comes either through perception or through conscience. So he cannot influence people by heavenly means unless they have love for him and charity for their neighbor. When the Lord operates by spiritual means, or by way of true ideas, he acts on every one of us. If he did not, we would be unable to think or talk. When by nature we pervert everything good and true, when we have no interest in heavenly or spiritual matters, then nothing heavenly, or good, influences us; the conduit for heavenly goodness closes. Yet what is spiritual, or true, does still influence us, and the conduit for such things is kept permanently open. From this you can see what the intermediate, rational self is.<br />[4] Abram here symbolizes the inner self within the intermediate self. When heavenly goodness from the inner self acts on the intermediate self, the inner self takes over the intermediate self and makes that self its own, although the intermediate self remains distinct from the inner. The same thing happens when the inner self acts through the intermediate self to influence the outward self; it then takes over the outward self as well and makes that self its own, although the outward self remains distinct from the intermediate.<br />That is what happened in this situation, where the Lord's inner self perceived in his intermediate self the conditions that existed for his outward self. His inward self saw that his outward self had been captured, that is, that it had been seized by apparent rather than actual goodness and truth, which were the weapons by which his outward self had fought so many enemies. When his inward self perceived this, it brought its influence to bear, reduced everything to order, and freed his outer self from what plagued it. In this way his inner self purified apparent goodness and truth; it changed them from apparent into actual goodness and truth, and so into goodness and truth allied with his inward, divine self. The means, as I said, was his intermediate self.<br />[5] In one respect the Lord was unlike any other person: his intermediate self was divine, so far as its heavenly goodness went, and was attached to his inner self from birth. His inner self along with this part of his intermediate self was Jehovah himself, his Father. In another respect, though, he resembled other people: his intermediate self was attached to his outward self, so far as its spiritual truths went, and thus was human. But this self too he made divine, or turned it into Jehovah, by fighting his spiritual battles under his own power and winning consistently.<br />The outer self is what is being called Lot. In a previous state he is referred to as Abram's nephew [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1707/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_12" target=_top>Genesis 14:12</a>], but in his current state, as Abram's brother. The outer self is described as a nephew when apparent truth and goodness seize control of it, but it is called a brother when real goodness and real truth do. </p>

Abram heard that his brother was taken captive. That this signifies that the interior man perceived in what state the external was, is evident from the signification of "Abram" in the verse that immediately 
precedes this, as being the interior man to which the internal or Divine man was adjoined; and from the signification of "Lot," as being the external man, as has been shown before; also from the 
signification of "hearing that his brother was captive," as being to perceive in what state the external man was, namely, as was said in verse 12, that apparent goods and truths had possession of it. 
 [2] The case is this: When the interior man (meant by "Abram the Hebrew") perceived that the goods and truths from which the combat was waged were not goods and truths except apparently, and that 
they had possession of the whole of the external man (signified by "Lot, his brother's son"), then the interior man, or the Divine internal man through the interior, purified them. How this is done, 
no one can possibly know but he to whom it has been revealed; for the influx of the internal man, through the interior or middle man, into the external man, is an arcanum, especially at the present time, 
when few, if any, know what the interior man is, and still less what the internal man is. What the internal man is, and what the interior man, may be seen just above, at verse 13. But here it shall 
be briefly stated what is the nature of the influx.  [3] The internal man in everyone belongs to the Lord alone; for there the Lord stores up the goods and truths with which He gifts man from infancy. 
Thence through these He flows into the interior or rational man, and through this into the exterior; in this way it is given to the man to think, and to be a man. But the influx from the internal 
man into the interior or middle man, and so into the exterior man, is twofold; it is either by celestial things, or by spiritual things or what is the same, it is either by goods, or by truths. By celestial 
things, or goods, it flows in only with regenerate men, who have been gifted either with perception or with conscience; thus it flows in by perception or by conscience; for which reason the influx 
by celestial things has no existence except with those who are in love to the Lord and in charity toward the neighbor. But by spiritual things, or truths, the Lord flows in with every man; and unless 
there were this influx the man could not think, and therefore could not speak. When a man is such that he perverts the goods and truths, and when he cares nothing for celestial and spiritual things, 
there is then no influx of celestial things, or goods, but the way for these is closed; and yet there is an influx of spiritual things, or truths, for a way for them is continually kept open. Hence 
may be seen what is the nature of the interior or middle, that is, of the rational man.  [4] The internal man in the interior or middle man is here signified by "Abram." When the celestial things, or 
goods, flow in from the internal man into the interior man, the internal man then appropriates to itself the interior or middle man, and makes it its own; but the interior or middle man is still distinct 
from the internal man. The case is similar when the internal man flows in through the interior or middle man into the exterior man, for then it likewise appropriates the exterior man to itself, 
and makes it its own; but yet the exterior man is distinct from the interior man. So now, when the internal man perceived in the interior or middle man that the state of the external man was such, namely, 
that the external man was made captive, that is, that not genuine but apparent goods and truths had taken possession of it, from which it had fought against so many enemies, it then flowed in, and 
reduced all things to order, and liberated it from the things which infested it, and thus purified it, that is to say, so that its goods and truths were not apparent but genuine goods and truths, and 
were thus conjoined with the internal or Divine man; and this, as before said, by means of the interior or middle man.  [5] In this the Lord was not like any man for His interior man as to celestial 
things or goods was Divine, and was adjoined to His internal man even from birth. His internal man, together with this interior man, was Jehovah Himself, His Father. But He was similar to other men 
in this, that His interior man as to spiritual things or truths had been adjoined to His external man, and thus was Human; but this also was made Divine, that is, Jehovah, by means of combats of temptations 
and continual victories from its own power. The external man is what is called "Lot;" in the former state however this is called "Abram's brothers son," but in this "Abram's brother;" for it was 
called his brother's son when possessed by apparent goods and truths, but his brother when possessed by genuine goods and truths. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1707</b></p><p><b>1707.</b>
That 'Abram heard that his brother had been taken captive' means that the Interior Man perceived the nature of the state of the External Man is clear from the meaning of 'Abram' in the previous verse 
as the Interior Man to which the Internal or Divine Man was joined; from the meaning of 'Lot' as the External Man, as shown already; and also from the meaning of 'hearing that his brother had been taken 
captive' as perceiving the nature of its state, namely, as stated in verse 12, that- apparent goods and truths had possession of it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The situation is this: When the Interior Man meant by 'Abram 
the Hebrew' perceived that the goods and truths from which the battle was being fought were not in fact goods and truths except in appearance, and that these had possession of the entire External 
Man meant by 'Lot his brother's son', the Interior Man, or rather the Divine Internal Man by means of the Interior Man, purified them. How this is done nobody can possibly know except one to whom it 
has been revealed. Indeed the influx of the internal man into the external man by way of the interior man situated between them is an arcanum, especially at the present time when few if any know what 
the interior man is, still less what the internal man is. As to what the internal man and the interior man are, see just above at verse 13. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But the nature of this influx will be mentioned briefly 
here. The internal man residing in everyone is the Lord's alone, for the Lord there stores away the goods and truths which He confers on man from earliest childhood. By way of these He flows from the 
internal man into the interior or rational man, and by way of this into the external man; and in this way man is enabled to think and be man. But the influx from the internal man into the interior 
man in between, and so into the external man, is twofold, passing either through celestial things or through spiritual, or what amounts to the same, either through goods or through truths. The influx 
through celestial things, or goods, occurs solely with regenerate persons, who have had either perception or conscience conferred on them, so that such influx is either by way of perception or else by 
way of conscience. Consequently influx by way of celestial things does not exist except among those with whom love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour are present. By way of spiritual things, 
or truths, however, the Lord flows into every person; and without that influx no one would have been able to think, nor thus to speak. When a person is such that he perverts goods and truths and does 
not care at all about celestial and spiritual things, no influx of celestial things, or goods, takes place. But though the road for celestial things and goods is closed, still an influx of spiritual 
things or truths takes place, that road being kept open all the time. This makes clear the nature of the interior man or man situated between internal man and external, which is the rational man. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
Here 'Abram' means the internal man within the interior man situated between internal and external. When celestial things, or goods, flow in from the internal man into the interior man, the internal 
man takes to itself the interior man and makes it its own; yet the latter remains distinct and separate from the internal man. Similarly when the internal man flows into the external man through the 
interior man between the two, it takes this man also to itself, and makes it its own; yet that external man remains distinct and separate from the interior. So now, once the Internal Man perceived 
within the Interior Man that the state of the External Man was such - that is to say, that it 'had been taken captive' meaning that not genuine but apparent goods and truths had taken possession of it, 
from which goods and truths He fought against so many foes - that Internal Man flowed in, restored all things to order, and released the External Man from the things that infested it. The Internal Man 
accordingly purified the External Man, that is to say, so that there were present not apparent but genuine goods and truths, which were thus joined to the Internal or Divine Man- that conjunction being 
effected, as has been stated, through the Interior Man. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In one respect the Lord was not like any other human being, for His Interior Man as regards celestial things, or goods, was Divine, 
and from birth was joined to the Internal Man. The Internal Man together with this Interior Man was His Father, Jehovah Himself. But in another respect He was like others, in that His Interior Man as 
regards spiritual things, or truths, was joined to the External Man, and so was Human; but this too was by His own power made Divine, that is, Jehovah, through conflicts constituting temptations and through 
repeated victories. It is the External Man that is called 'Lot'; but in the previous state the expression 'brother's son' is used, in the present state 'Abram's brother'. It was called 'his brother's 
son' when apparent truths and goods had possession of it, but 'his brother' when genuine goods and genuine truths did so. </p>

Quod 'audivit Abram quod captivus factus frater ejus significet quod perceperit Interior Homo in quali statu esset Externus, constat a significatione 'Abrami' in versu mox praecedente quod sit Interior 
Homo cui adjunctus Internus seu Divinus; et ex significatione 'Loti' quod sit Externus Homo, ut prius ostensum est; tum ex significatione 'audire quod captivus frater ejus' quod sit percipere in quali

ex quibus pugnatum, non essent bona et vera nisi apparenter, et quod illa occupaverint totum Externum Hominem per 'Lotum filium fratris' significatum, tunc Interior Homo, seu Internus Divinus per Interiorem

tempore cum pauci si ulli norunt quid interior homo, minus quid internus; quid internus et interior homo, vide mox supra ad vers. 13; sed hic qualis influxus sit, paucis dicetur;  [3] internus homo 
apud unumquemvis hominem est solius Domini, nam ibi recondit Dominus bona et vera quibus donat hominem ab infantia; inde per illa influit in interiorem seu rationalem, et per hunc in exteriorem, sic datur 
homini cogitare, et esse homo: sed influxus ab interno homine in interiorem seu medium et sic in exteriorem est duplex, vel per caelestia vel per spiritualia, seu quod idem est, vel per bona vel 
per vera; per caelestia seu bona influit solum apud homines regeneratos, qui vel perceptione, vel conscientia donati sunt, ita per perceptionem vel per conscientiam, quare influxus per caelestia non datur 
nisi apud eos qui in amore in Dominum et in charitate erga proximum sunt; per spiritualia autem aut vera, influit Dominus apud unumquemvis hominem, qui influxus nisi foret, non potuisset homo cogitare, 
ita nec loqui; quando homo talis est ut pervertat bona et vera, et cum nihil curat caelestia et spiritualia, tunc nullus est influxus caelestium seu bonorum, sed est via pro caelestibus et bonis 
clausa, et usque est influxus spiritualium seu verorum, quae via continue aperta tenetur; exinde constare potest qualis est interior seu medius, hoc est, rationalis homo.  [4] Hic per 'Abramum' significatur 
internus homo in interiore seu medio; cum caelestia seu bona ab interno homine influunt in interiorem, tunc internus appropriat sibi interiorem seu medium et suum facit, sed usque est interior 
seu medius homo distinctus ab interno; similiter fit cum internus homo per interiorem seu medium influit in exteriorem, tunc quoque appropriat sibi eum et suum facit, sed usque est exterior homo distinctus 
ab interiore. Ita nunc cum percepit Internus in Interiore seu Medio quod talis status esset Externi Hominis, quod nempe hic 'captivus factus,' hoc est, quod bona et vera non genuina sed apparentia 
occupaverint eum, a quibus contra tot hostes pugnavit tunc influxit, et omnia in ordinem redegit, et liberavit illa ab illis quae infestarunt, et sic purificavit, ut nempe non bona et vera apparentia 
essent, sed bona et vera genuina, et sic conjuncta Interno seu Divino, et hoc, ut dictum, per Interiorem seu Medium:  [5] in illo Dominus non similis fuit alicui homini, quia Interior Ipsius Homo 
quoad caelestia seu bona Divinus fuit, et ab ipsa nativitate adjunctus Interno; Internus cum hoc Interiore fuit Ipse Jehovah Pater Ipsius; at in illo similis fuit aliis hominibus, quod Interior Ipsius 
Homo quoad spiritualia seu vera adjunctus fuerit Externo, et sic Humanus; sed hic quoque per pugnas tentationum et victorias continuas ex propria potentia factus quoque Divinus, hoc est, Jehovah. Externus 
Homo est qua appellatur 'Lotus,' sed is in priore statu dicitur 'illius fratris,' in hoc autem 'frater Abrami'; tunc enim dictus est filius fratris cum vera et bona apparentia illum occuparent, 
at frater cum genuina bona et genuina vera. </p>
