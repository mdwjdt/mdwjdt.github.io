<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9550节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9550.</strong>“那灯台要做成实心的”表它的一切必须源于良善。这从“实心”的含义清楚可知，“实心”是指全部，因而是指它的一切源于“金”所表示的良善的必要性。事实上，“灯台”因用来发光而表示的整个属灵层由属天层产生，也通过属天层而不断存在，正如一切真理皆源于良善。如果拿走良善，真理瞬间就灭绝，因为良善是真理的灵魂。此处的情形就像爱之良善和思维的关系。如果拿走情感，思维瞬间就灭绝；因为情感是思维的实际生命或灵魂。属于爱的一切情感皆与良善有关，源于它的一切思维皆与真理有关。源于良善的真理被称为属灵的，真理所源于的良善被称为属天的。</p>

Solid shall the lampstand be made. That this signifies that all is from good, is evident from the signification of "solid," as being wholly, thus all from good, which is signified by "gold." For all 
the spiritual (which is signified by "the lampstand"), insofar as it illumines, comes forth from the celestial, and also continually subsists through the same, as all truth does from good; for if good 
is withdrawn, truth is extinguished in a moment, because good is the soul of truth. The case herein is like that of the affection of love in regard to thought; if the affection of love is withdrawn, 
thought is instantly extinguished; for affection is the very life or soul of thought. All the affection that is of love is of good, and all the thought from it is of truth. The truth which is from good 
is called the spiritual, and the good from which is truth is called the celestial. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9550</b></p><p><b>9550.</b>
'Solid shall the lampstand be made' means that all of it must spring from good. This is clear from the meaning of 'solid' as the entire whole, consequently as the necessity for all of it to spring from 
good, which is meant by 'gold'. For the whole of the spiritual, meant by 'the lampstand' since it serves to shed light, arises from the celestial and is also kept in constant being by means of it, 
even as all truth springs from good. If you take away good, truth is instantly wiped out; for the soul of truth is good. It is like an affection belonging to love and its link to thought. If that affection 
is taken away, the thought is immediately wiped out; for the affection is the actual life or the soul of the thought. Every affection belonging to love has connection with good, and every thought 
springing from it has connection with truth. The truth which springs from good is called spiritual, and the good from which the truth springs is called celestial.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 9550</b>
</p><b>9550.</b>
`Solidum fiet candelabrum': quod significet quod omne ex bono, constat ex significatione `solidi' quod sit totum quantum, ita omne ex bono, quod per `aurum' significatur; omne enim spirituale, quod 
per `candelabrum,' quatenus illuminat, significatur, existit ex caelesti, et quoque continue per id subsistit, sicut omne verum a bono; nam si bonum subducis, exstinguitur momento verum, anima enim veri 
est bonum; se habet hoc sicut affectio quae amoris ad cogitationem; si subducitur affectio quae amoris, exstinguitur ilico cogitatio, affectio enim est ipsa vita seu anima cogitationis; omnis affectio 
quae amoris, est boni, et omnis cogitatio inde est veri; {1}verum quod ex bono vocatur spirituale, et bonum ex quo verum, vocatur caeleste. @1 verum est quod vocatur spirituale, et bonum quod coeleste$ </p>
