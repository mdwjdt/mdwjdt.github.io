<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>154.</strong>罪恶和错误无非出于人的自我，因为人的自我是罪恶之本。故此，人全然由罪恶和错误构成。我从以下事实明了这一点：当人的自我显形于精灵界时，它丑陋至极，随各人的秉性，表现各异。凡看见的人，无不心生恐惧，急欲逃离，如见了魔鬼一般。当人的自我被主赋予生气以后，它就显得美丽可爱了，也照主赋予生命的不同而表现各异。被赋予仁爱之心者，看似漂亮的少男少女，被赋予纯真之性者，看似赤身的婴儿，有花环环绕胸前，头上也戴着冠冕。他们在钻石般的光芒中玩耍，从心里感受到快乐。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]154.</strong> Nothing evil or false can possibly exist that is not our own and the product of our "autonomy." Human selfhood is wickedness itself, and consequently a human being is nothing but evil and falsity.<br />This fact has stood out whenever I have seen people's intrinsic characteristics presented visually in the world of spirits.{*1} The sight is as ugly as any a painter could paint — with variations, according to the nature of the particular personality involved. It is so hideous that the individual whose traits are being displayed shudders at herself or himself and wants to run, as if from the Devil.{*2} When the Lord gives life to our intrinsic characteristics, though, they look lovely and beautiful — with variations, depending on the particular life involved and the heavenly quality the Lord can add to it. Those provided with charity, or enlivened by it, look like boys and girls with strikingly beautiful faces. Those for whom the quality is innocence look like toddlers, naked but decked out in different ways, with flower garlands around their chests or tiaras on their heads, living at play in diamond-bright air, attuned to the happiness that wells up from deep within.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Here Swedenborg alludes to a striking feature of the spiritual world: the characteristics, moods, and thoughts of individuals may be represented around them in any of a vast variety of displays (see also notes 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_154/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_18" target=_top>18</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_154/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1" target=_top>1</a> in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_154/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_41" target=_top>41</a>). For example, a hypocrite is said to create a display like a snake shedding its skin (Spiritual Experiences [Swedenborg 1998-2002] <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_154/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_4351" target=_top>4351</a>), and those who think obscene things actually project obscene displays around them (Spiritual Experiences [Swedenborg 1998-2002] <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_154/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_1695" target=_top>1695</a>). The displays emanating from good people, however, may be extremely beautiful (Spiritual Experiences [Swedenborg 1998-2002] <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_154/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_2350" target=_top>2350</a>). Spirits are said to actually use such projections as adjuncts to their speech (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_154/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1641#subsection-2-2" target=_top>Secrets of Heaven 1641:2</a>) or as complete substitutes for it (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_154/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1764" target=_top>1764</a>); and as tools to educate children in the next world (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_154/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2299" target=_top>2299</a>). [SS]<br />{*2} Swedenborg here casually mentions "the Devil," which readers might take to mean one supreme "Satan," or "Lucifer," that is, an angel who was cast down and became the ruler of hell (a concept based on <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_154/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_14_12" target=_top>Isaiah 14:12</a>; see also note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_154/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_254" target=_top>254</a>), or else a single evil force opposite God. Both conceptions were general among Christians in Swedenborg's times; but in fuller discussions elsewhere, Swedenborg asserts that they are false. In his usage, "the Devil" is a collective term for hell (see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_154/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_251#subsection-2-2" target=_top>251:2</a> of the present work; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_154/swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_311" target=_top>Heaven and Hell 311</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_154/swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_544" target=_top>544</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_154/swedenborg_last-judgment-chadwick_14" target=_top>Last Judgment 14</a>). His terminology for those who dwell in hell is flexible. He sometimes uses the term "evil spirits" to apply to all those in hell; but at other times he speaks of two classes of people in hell, one called "evil spirits," or "satans," and the other called "devils," or "demons." The distinction is outlined in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_154/swedenborg_divine-love-and-wisdom-dole_273" target=_top>Divine Love and Wisdom 273</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_154/swedenborg_divine-providence-dole_310#subsection-2-3" target=_top>Divine Providence 310:3</a>, and mentioned in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_154/swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_311#subsection-2-2" target=_top>Heaven and Hell 311:2</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_154/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_281#subsection-2-12" target=_top>True Christianity 281:12</a>. Where Swedenborg makes the distinction, "evil spirits" are associated with false thoughts, love for the world, and justification of obsessions with evil, whereas "demons" are associated with demonic loves, love for oneself, and acting out obsessions with evil. In these cases he consistently describes "devils" or "demons" as more profoundly wicked than "evil spirits" or "satans." [JSR] </p>

Nothing evil and false is ever possible which is not man's Own, and from man's Own, for the Own of man is evil itself, and consequently man is nothing but evil and falsity. This has been evident to me 
from the fact that when the things of man's Own are presented to view in the world of spirits, they appear so deformed that it is impossible to depict anything more ugly, yet with a difference according 
to the nature of the Own, so that he to whom the things of the Own are visibly exhibited is struck with horror, and desires to flee from himself as from a devil. But truly the things of man's Own 
that have been vivified by the Lord appear beautiful and lovely, with variety according to the life to which the celestial of the Lord can be applied; and indeed those who have been endowed with charity, 
or vivified by it, appear like boys and girls with most beautiful countenances; and those who are in innocence, like naked infants, variously adorned with garlands of flowers encircling their bosoms, 
and diadems upon their heads, living and sporting in a diamond-like aura, and having a perception of happiness from the very inmost. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 154</b></p><p><b>154.</b>
Nothing evil or false can possibly exist that is not the proprium or derived from the proprium. For man's proprium is evil itself, which means that man is nothing but evil and falsity. This has become 
clear to me from the fact that when the contents of the proprium are presented to view in the world of spirits they look so ugly that nobody can paint any uglier picture. (Those contents vary however 
according to the nature of the proprium.) As a result when anyone is offered a glimpse of the contents of his proprium he is horrified at himself and wishes to run as though from the devil. On the other 
hand contents of the proprium which have been given life by the Lord look beautiful and attractive, varying according to the life to which a celestial quality that is the Lord's can be added. Indeed 
people who have received charity, that is, been made alive by it, look like boys and girls with very attractive faces. And people who have received innocence look like naked small children adorned 
in different ways with garlands of flowers twined around their breasts, and precious stones in their hair, living and playing in brightest light, with a sense of happiness stemming from the depths of 
their being.

Nihil usquam malum et falsum datur quod non est proprium et ex proprio; nam proprium hominis est ipsum malum, inde homo non est nisi malum et falsum; quod constare mihi potuit ex eo quod cum propria 
videnda sistantur in mundo spirituum, appareant ita deformia ut deformius nusquam pingi possit, cum diversitate secundum proprii naturam, sic ut is cui ejus propria videnda praebentur, semet horreat 
et fugere velit ut diabolum. At vero propria quae vivificata sunt a Domino, apparent pulchra et venusta, cum varietate secundum vitam cui caeleste Domini applicari potest; et quidem qui praediti fuerunt 
seu vivificati charitate, apparent ut pueri et puellae venustissima facie; et qui innocentia, ut infantes nudi varie decorati, florum sertis circum pectus cincti, diadematibus circum caput, viventes 
et ludentes in aura adamantina, cum perceptione felicitatis ex intimis. </p>
