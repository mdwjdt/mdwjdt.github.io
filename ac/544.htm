<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>544.</strong>某些灵被允许进入第一层的纯真天堂，从那里与我对话，坦承说，这欢喜快乐的状态超乎他们所有的想象。然而，这仅是在第一层天堂，因为有三层天堂，每一层都有无数种纯真状态。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]544.</strong> A group admitted into the innocent state of the first heaven{*1} spoke to me from there and confessed that the condition of that heaven was so glad and joyful that it could never be imagined in the least. This was in merely the first heaven. There are three heavens, and each enjoys a state of innocence, with all its countless variations.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The translation here is based on reading statum innocentiae primi coeli, "innocent state of the first heaven," for the first Latin edition's coelum innocentiae primi coeli, "heaven of innocence of the first heaven." Compare Swedenborg's unpublished manuscript Spiritual Experiences (Swedenborg 1998-2002) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_544/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_832" target=_top>832</a>, where the term "innocent state" is used in what appears to be a preliminary draft of this section.

Certain spirits who were admitted into the heaven of innocence of the first heaven spoke to me thence, and confessed that the state of joy and gladness was such as they never could have conceived any 
idea of. Yet this was only in the first heaven, and there are three heavens, and states of innocence in each, with their innumerable varieties. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 544</b></p><p><b>544.</b>
Certain spirits were admitted into the heaven of innocence belonging to the first heaven, and from there they spoke to me. They declared that it was a state of joy and delight, such as no one could possibly 
imagine. And yet this was merely in the first heaven; for there are three heavens, and in each one there are states of innocence possessing countless variations.  </p>

</p><b>544.</b>
Quidam in caelum innocentiae primi caeli admissi, et inde mecum locuti; confessi sunt quod talis gaudii et laetitiae status sit ut nusquam aliqua idea capi queat; sed erat hoc solum in primo caelo; 
nam tres caeli sunt et in unoquovis status innocentiae eum suis innumeris varietatibus. </p>
