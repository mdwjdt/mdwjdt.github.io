<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9076节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9076.</strong>“倘若给他定了赎罪”表为叫他免受诅咒。这从“赎罪”的含义清楚可知，“赎罪”是指为叫他免受诅咒。因为赎罪的行为被施加在那些不是故意，或以诡诈作恶的人身上。这些行为各种各样，并且当一个行为被执行时，它就被称为“赎命”（redemptions of the soul，即灵魂的救赎），因为生命通过它而被救赎。但这些外在事物表示的是内在事物；也就是说，“赎罪”表示从诅咒中释放出来，因此“（救）赎”表示通过实际的悔改而对属灵生命的修正。“赎罪”因表示从诅咒中释放出来，故也表示罪得赦免，因而得以洁净。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9076</b></p><p><b>9076.</b>
If expiation be laid on him. That this signifies that he may be free from damnation, is evident from the signification of "expiation," as being that he may be free from damnation. For expiations were 
laid upon those who did evil not of set purpose, or with deceit; and they were various, and were in such case called "redemptions of the soul," for by them the life was redeemed. But these external things 
signified internal things; namely, "expiation" signified liberation from damnation, consequently "redemption" signified amendment of spiritual life through actual repentance. As "expiation" signified 
liberation from damnation, it consequently also signified the pardon of sins, and the consequent cleansing. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9076</b></p><p><b>9076.</b>
'If expiation has been imposed on him' means in order that he may be made free from damnation. This is clear from the meaning of 'expiation' as in order that he may be free from damnation. For acts of 
expiation were imposed on those who did not do evil on purpose or with guile. Those acts were various, and when one was performed it was called 'a redeeming of the soul', since life was redeemed by 
means of it. But those outward things were signs of inward ones; that is to say, 'an expiation' meant deliverance from damnation, and 'redeeming' consequently meant amendment of spiritual life through 
active repentance. Since 'expiation' meant deliverance from damnation, therefore it also meant being pardoned of sins, and so being cleansed. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 9076</b>
</p><b>9076.</b>
`Si expiatio posita sit super illum': quod significet ut expers damnationis fiat, constat ex significatione `expiationis' quod sit ut expers sit damnationis; expiationes enim ponebantur super illos 
qui non ex proposito aut {1} dolo malum fecerunt, et fuerunt variae, quae (o)tunc vocabantur redemptiones animae, nam per illa redimebatur vita; sed externa illa significabant interna, nempe `expiatio' 
liberationem a damnatione, inde {2} redemptio emendationem vitae spiritualis per actualem paenitentiam.  Quia `expiatio' significabat liberationem a damnatione, inde quoque significabat condonationem 
peccatorum, et inde mundationem. @1 ac$ @2 ita$ </p>
