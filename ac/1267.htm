<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1267节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1267.</strong>其中那些顽固地试图走出地狱的人会遭到其同伴的残忍对待，因为他们对每个人，甚至对同伴都怀有致命的仇恨。他们的最大乐趣就在于使别人臣服于自己，甚至将他置于死地。那些坚持不懈地试图闯出去的人会被送到被雾笼罩的岩石下面的更深处。因为他们疯狂而又根深蒂固的欲望就是摧毁引领他们的所有人。他们的努力就是那欲望的产物。无论遇见谁，这些人都会用布将其包裹起来，以便俘虏他们，然后把他们扔进其自认为是海的地方，要么就残酷对待他们。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1267.</strong> The ones that obstinately continue trying to emerge from that hell meet with cruel treatment at the hands of their companions, since they nurse a murderous hatred for all, even their associates. Their highest pleasure consists in holding each other enslaved and virtually butchering their captives.<br />The ones who persist even more stubbornly in their effort are sent still farther down under the misty crag. An insane rage to annihilate everyone, ingrained in them, is what goads them on; it is what makes them struggle to break free.<br />When they come across others, they wrap them in a piece of cloth, lead them away captive, and throw them into what they take to be a sea. Or they abuse them in some other way. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1267</b></p><p><b>1267.</b>
Those of them who obstinately try to emerge from that hell are cruelly treated by their companions; for they are possessed with deadly hatred against all, even against their companions. Their greatest 
delight consists in holding each other in subjection, and as it were in butchering each other. Those who more resolutely persist in the endeavor to force their way out, are sent down still deeper under 
the misty rock; for it is their innate crazy ardor to destroy all, that leads them on; hence their efforts to emerge. They wrap all they meet in a cloth, in order to take them captive, and cast them 
into a certain sea, as it appears to them, or otherwise treat them savagely. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1267</b></p><p><b>1267.</b>
Those of them who obstinately go on trying to get out of that hell are treated in a cruel fashion by their own companions, for they harbor deadly hatred against everyone, even against companions. Each 
of them finds his greatest delight in holding another in subjection to himself and so to speak doing him to death. And those who persist even more strenuously in the attempt to force their way out are 
sent even further down beneath the rock enveloped in mist. For it is an insane and deeply rooted desire to destroy everybody that spurs them on. Their efforts are the product of that desire. Whomever 
they meet they roll up in a cloth and<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> carry off as captives, and then cast them into what is seen by them as the sea, or else treat them savagely.

</p><b>1267.</b>
Qui eorum obstinate tentant ab inferno isto emergere, crudeliter a sociis eorum tractantur; nam est iis odium internecinum contra omnes, etiam contra socios; summa eorum jucunditas in eo consistit ut 
unus alterum sibi subjectum habeat, et quasi trucidet: quique obnixius perstant eniti, ii adhuc profundius demittuntur sub petra nimbosa; nam est vesanus insitus ardor perdendi omnes qui inducit eos; 
inde conatus emergendi: quos enim offendunt, panno involvunt ut captivos abducunt, et projiciunt in quoddam, ut iis apparet, mare, aut aliter saeve tractant. </p>
