<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>315.</strong>反之，他的秉性若决定他不愿受教，就会寻求离开。天使能清楚觉察这一点，因为在灵界，一切思想念头是相通的。即便如此，天使依然不会离开，但是苏醒的灵魂想要离开天使。天使爱每一个人，乐意给予帮助和指教，将人引入天堂，这是他们最大的快乐。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]315.</strong> But if the revived person or soul is not the kind who wants to learn, he or she then wants to leave the angels' company. The angels are quick to perceive this because in the next life all the ideas involved in our thinking are shared generally. When we are eager to part with the angels, they do not leave us but we disconnect from them. Angels love everyone and want nothing more than to be helpful to us, teach us, and take us up into heaven. That is their highest pleasure. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 315</b></p><p><b>315.</b>
But if the resuscitated person or soul is not of such a character as to be willing to be instructed, he then desires to be rid of the company of the angels, which they exquisitely perceive, for in the 
other life there is a communication of all the ideas of thought. Still, they do not leave him even then, but he dissociates himself from them. The angels love everyone, and desire nothing more than 
to render him kindly services, to instruct him, and to convey him to heaven. In this consists their highest delight. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 315</b></p><p><b>315.</b>
But if he is not the kind who wishes to be told, the awakened person, or soul, is in that case eager to get away from the company of those angels. This the angels are quick to perceive, for in the next 
life all the ideas constituting a person's thought are communicated. When he is eager to get away from them, it is not they who abandon him, but he who severs his connection with them. Angels love 
everybody and above all else wish to render kindly services, to inform, and to lead him to heaven. Their chief delight consists in doing these things.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 315</b>
</p><b>315.</b>
At si non talis ut instrui velit, tunc cupit resuscitatus seu anima ab angelorum consortio, quod angeli exquisite percipiunt; nam in altera vita datur communicatio omnium idearum cogitationis: et quando 
cupit ab illis, tunc illi non relinquunt eum, sed is se dissociat ab illis: angeli unumquemvis amant et nihil prius desiderant quam officia praestare, instruere, et auferre in caelum; in eo illorum 
summa delectatio consistit. </p>
