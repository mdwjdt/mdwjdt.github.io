<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2724节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2724.</strong>“又在那里求告永生神的名”表由此而来的敬拜。这从“求告神的名”的含义清楚可知，“求告神的名”是指敬拜（参看<a href="440.htm">440</a>节）。古教会的人并不将“名”理解为名字，而是理解为全部品质（参看<a href="144.htm">144</a>-<a href="145.htm">145</a>，<a href="440.htm">440</a>，<a href="768.htm">768</a>，<a href="1754.htm">1754</a>，<a href="1896.htm">1896</a>，<a href="2009.htm">2009</a>节）；因此他们将“神的名”理解为借以敬拜神的集为一体的一切事物，因而理解为爱与信的一切事物。但是，一旦敬拜的内在消失，只有外在存留下来，人们就开始将神的名仅仅理解为名字，甚至敬拜名字本身，毫不关心其敬拜所根植的爱与信。因此，各个民族因其神明的名字而彼此区别开来；犹太人和以色列人则因敬拜耶和华而自己置于其它民族之上，将敬拜的本质置于说出并求告这个名字本身。而事实上，唯独对名字的敬拜根本不是敬拜，并且也存在于最坏的人当中，他们在唯独敬拜名字时亵渎更甚。<br />由于“神的名”表敬拜的一切事物，也就是全部的爱与信，祂通过爱与信被敬拜，故明显可知主祷文（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太6.9.htm">6:9</a>）中“愿人都尊你的名为圣”，以及主所说下面这些话是什么意思：<br />你们要为我的名被恨恶。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.22.htm">10:22</a>）<br />若是你们中间有两个人在地上求什么事，我在天上的父，必为他们成全。因为哪里有两三个人奉我的名聚会，哪里就有我在他们中间。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太18.19.htm">18:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太18.20.htm">20</a>）<br />凡为我的名撇下房屋或是弟兄、姐妹、父亲、母亲、妻子、儿女、田地的，必要得着百倍，并且承受永生。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太19.29.htm">19:29</a>）<br />和散那归于大卫的子孙！奉主名来的，是应当称颂的！（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.9.htm">21:9</a>）<br />耶稣说，从今以后，你们不得再见我，直等到你们说，奉主名来的，是应当称颂的！（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.39.htm">23:39</a>）<br />你们又要为我的名被万族恨恶。那时，必有许多人跌倒，也要彼此出卖，彼此恨恶。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.9.htm">24:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.10.htm">10</a>）<br />凡接待他的，就是信祂名的人，祂就赐他们权柄，作神的儿女。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.12.htm">1:12</a>）<br />不信的人，已受了审判，因为他不信神独生子的名。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.18.htm">3:18</a>）<br />耶稣说，你们若奉我的名求什么，我必成就。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.14.htm">14:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.15.htm">15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.16.htm">15:16</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.23.htm">16:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.24.htm">24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.26.htm">26</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.27.htm">27</a>）<br />耶稣说，我已将你的名向人显明了。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.6.htm">17:6</a>）<br />圣父啊，求你因你所赐给我的名保守他们，叫他们合而为一，像我们一样。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.11.htm">17:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.12.htm">12</a>）<br />我已让他们认识你的名，还要让他们认识，使你所爱我的爱在他们里面，我也在他们里面。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.26.htm">17:26</a>）<br />要叫你们信耶稣是基督，是神的儿子，并且你们信了，就可以因祂的名得生命。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约20.31.htm">20:31</a>）<br />此外，在旧约的很多经文中，耶和华和神的“名”并非表名字，而表示敬拜所根植的全部爱与信。<br />那些没有爱与信，仅敬拜名字的人在马太福音中以下列经文被论及：<br />当那日，必有许多人对我说，主啊，主啊，我们不是奉你的名传道，奉你的名赶鬼，奉你的名行许多异能吗？我就明明地告诉他们说，我从来不认识你们，你们这些作恶的人，离开我去吧！（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.22.htm">7:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.23.htm">23</a>）<br />如前所述，一旦教会成员从内在变得外在，开始将敬拜唯独置于一个名字中，那么他们就不再承认一神，而是承认多神。因为古人习惯在耶和华之名的后面加点什么，从而想到祂的某种好处或属性，如本节经文“他求告永生神的名”；还有下一章：<br />亚伯拉罕给那地方起名叫“耶和华以勒”，就是“耶和华必看顾”。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创22.14.htm">22:14</a>）<br />还有：<br />摩西筑了一座坛，起名叫“耶和华尼西”，就是“耶和华是我旌旗”。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出17.15.htm">17:15</a>）<br />基甸在那里为耶和华筑了一座坛，起名叫“耶和华沙龙”，就是“耶和华的平安。（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士6.24.htm">6:24</a>）<br />此外其它地方也有。正是由于这种习俗，那些将敬拜唯独置于一个名字的人才承认如此多的神明；在外邦人当中，尤其在希腊和罗马，如此多的神明被承认和敬拜；这些属性名字源于古教会，而古教会从来只敬拜一位神，这神以如此多的名字被崇敬，因为他们将“名”理解为品质。</p>

And called there on the name of the God of eternity. That this signifies worship therefrom, is evident from the signification of "calling upon the name of God," as being worship (see n. 440). They who 
were of the Ancient Church did not by a name understand the name, but all the quality (see n. 144-145, 440, 768, 1754, 1896, 2009); and thus by the "name of God" all that in one complex by which God 
was worshiped, consequently everything of love and faith; but when the internal of worship perished, and only the external remained, they then began to understand by the name of God nothing else than 
the name, so much so that they worshiped the name itself, feeling no care about the love and the faith from which they worshiped. On this account the nations began to distinguish themselves by the names 
of their gods; and the Jews and Israelites set themselves up above the rest, because they worshiped Jehovah, placing the essential of worship in uttering the name and invoking it, when in truth the 
worship of a name only is no worship, and may also be found among the worst of men, who thereby profane the more. [2] But as by the "name of God" everything of worship is signified, that is, everything 
of love and faith from which He is worshiped, it is therefore evident what is meant by "hallowed be Thy Name," in the Lord's Prayer (Matt. 6:9); also by what the Lord said: </p>
<p>     Ye shall be hated 
for My name's sake (Matt. 10:22).      If two shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them by My Father who is in the heavens; for where two or three are 
gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them (Matt. 18:19-20).      Everyone that hath left houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for 
My name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life (Matt. 19:29).      Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord (Matt. 21:9).      Jesus 
said, Ye shall not see Me henceforth till ye shall say, Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord (Matt. 23:39).      Ye shall be hated of all nations for My name's sake and then shall many 
be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another (Matt. 24:9-10).      As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, to them that believe on His name 
(John 1:12).      He that believeth not is judged already, because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God (John 3:18).      Jesus said, Whatsoever ye shall ask in My name, 
that will I do (John 14:14-15; 15:16; 16:23-24, 26-27).      Jesus said, I have manifested Thy name unto the men (John 17:6).      Holy Father, keep them in Thy name whom Thou hast given Me, that 
they may be one, as We are (John 17:11-12).      I have made known unto them Thy name, and will make it known; that the love wherewith Thou hast loved Me may be in them, and I in them (John 17:26).  
    That ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye may have life in His name (John 20:31).      Besides very many passages in the Old Testament, in which by the 
"name" of Jehovah and of God the name is not meant, but everything of love and faith from which is worship. [3] But they who worship a name only, without love and faith, are thus spoken of in Matthew: </p>
<p> 
    Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied by Thy name, and by Thy name have cast out demons, and in Thy name done many mighty works? But I will confess unto them, I 
know you not; depart from Me ye that work iniquity (Matt. 7:22-23).      When as before said the men of the church became external, from being internal, and began to place worship in a name alone, they 
then no longer acknowledged one God, but many. For it was a common thing for the ancients to add something to the name of Jehovah, and thereby call to mind some benefit or attribute of His, as in the 
passage before us, "he called upon the name of the God of eternity;" and in the following chapter (22), "Abraham called the name of that place, Jehovah-jireh," that is, "Jehovah shall see" (verse 14). 
"Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi," that is, "Jehovah my banner" (Exod. 17:15); "Gideon built an altar there unto Jehovah, and called it Jehovah-shalom" that is, "Jehovah 
of peace" (Judges 6:24); besides other places. From this it came to pass that they who placed worship in a name only, acknowledged so many gods; and also that among the Gentiles, especially in Greece 
and at Rome, so many gods were acknowledged and worshiped; whereas the Ancient Church, from which the epithets emanated, never worshiped but one God, reverenced under so many names, because by the 
"name" they understood the quality. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2724</b></p><p><b>2724.</b>
'And there he called on the name of [Jehovah,] the God of Eternity' means worship from it. This is clear from the meaning of 'calling on the name of God' as worship, dealt with in <a href="440.htm">440</a>. Those who belonged 
to the Ancient Church did not understand merely name by the word 'name' but the entire nature, see <a href="144.htm">144</a>, <a href="145.htm">145</a>, <a href="340.htm">340</a>, <a href="768.htm">768</a>,<a href="1754.htm">1754</a>,<a href="1896.htm">1896</a>, <a href="2009.htm">2009</a>. Thus by 'the name of God' they understood everything in one 
embrace by which God was worshipped, consequently everything of love and faith. But once the internal aspect of worship perished and only the external was left people began to understand nothing else 
by 'the name of God' than the name. Indeed they went so far as to worship the name itself, being quite indifferent to what the love and the faith were in which their worship was grounded. As a result 
of this nations began to identify themselves by the names of their gods, the Jews and Israelites setting themselves above the rest because they worshipped Jehovah. They made the utterance and the calling 
upon the name itself the essential feature of worship; but in fact worship of the name alone is not worship at all, for that practice may exist even among the worst of people who in worshipping the 
name alone become greater profaners.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Now because 'the name of God' means the entirety of worship, that is, the love and faith in their entirety from which He is worshipped, it is therefore clear 
what is meant by hallowed be Your name - in the Lord's Prayer, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%206:%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 6: 9</a>, and what by the following words spoken by the Lord, </p>
<p>You will be hated by everyone for My name's sake. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2010:%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 10: 22</a>. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>There are in addition very many places in the Old Testament in which the name of Jehovah and of God is not used to mean the name but love and faith in their entirety in which 
worship is grounded. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But those who worship the name alone, without love and faith, are spoken of in Matthew as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
Many will say to Me on that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy through 
Your name, and cast out demons through Your name, and do many mighty works in Your name? But I will confess to them, I do not know you; depart from Me, you workers of iniquity. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%207:%2022,%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 7: 22, 23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>As 
has been stated, once the member of the Church from being internal became external, and began to make worship consist in a name alone, people no longer acknowledged one God but many. For it was 
a custom among the ancients to add something after the name of Jehovah and by doing that to call to mind some benefit or attribute of His, as in the present verse, 'He called on the name of [Jehovah,] 
the God of Eternity'. Another example occurs in the next chapter, </p>
<blockquote>
Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah Jireh (that is, Jehovah will see). <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2022:%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 22: 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And the following, among others, 
are further examples, </p>
<blockquote>
Moses built an altar and called the name of it Jehovah Nissi (that is, Jehovah is my banner). <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2017:%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 17: 15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Gideon built an altar to Jehovah and called it [the altar] of Jehovah 
Shalom (that is, of peace). <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%206:%2024&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 6: 24</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>It was from this custom that those who made worship consist in a name alone came to acknowledge so many gods, and also that among the gentiles, especially 
those in Greece and Rome, so many gods came to be acknowledged and worshipped, whereas the Ancient Church from which those attributive names derived always worshipped but one God who was revered 
under so many names, for the reason that by 'name' they understood the essential nature.

iniquitatem, vii 22, 23. Cum, ut dictum, homo Ecclesiae ab interno factus est externus, et in solo nomine coepit ponere cultum, tunc non magis unum agnoverunt Deum, sed plures; sollemne enim antiquis 
fuit aliquid adjicere nomini Jehovae, ac inde recordari alicujus beneficii aut attributi Ipsius, ut hic, `Invocavit nomen Dei aeternitatis.' In cap. seq. xxii, 	Vocavit Abraham nomen loci illius, 
Jehovah Jirah, hoc est {3}, videbit, vers. 14: </p>
<p>	Aedificabat Moses altare, et vocavit nomen ejus, Jehovah Nissi, hoc est {4}, vexillum meum, Exod. xvii 15: </p>
<p>	Aedificabat Gideon altare Jehovae, et vocavit 
Jehovae Shalom, hoc est {3}, pacis, Jud. vi 24; </p>
<p>praeter alia; inde factum, quod qui in solo nomine ponerent {4} cultum, tot deos agnoscerent; et quod etiam inde apud gentiles, imprimis in Graecia, 
et Romae, tot dii agniti et culti sint, cum tamen Antiqua Ecclesia a qua epitheta illa emanaverunt, nusquam nisi quam unum Deum sub tot nominibus veneratum coluit, ex causa quia per `nomen' intellexit 
quale {5}. 	@1 i ipsum.$ 	@2 constare potest.$ 	@3 seu.$ 	@4 ponebant.$ 	@5 nihil aliud intellexit quam quale.$ </p>
