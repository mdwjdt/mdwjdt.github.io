<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1488节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1488.</strong>“他的全家”表祂已收聚之物。这从“全家”的含义清楚可知，“全家”在此表收聚的记忆知识。收聚记忆知识，然后藉着它们构筑外在人，将其建造起来，这和盖房子差不多；因此，圣言的很多经文都以“造”和“建造房屋”来表示这类事物。如以赛亚书：<br />我造新天新地；他们要建造房屋，自己居住；栽种葡萄园，吃其中的果子。并不是他们建造而别人来住。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.17.htm">65:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.21.htm">21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.22.htm">22</a>）<br />此处“房屋”表有聪明智慧之处，因而表有善与真的知识之处；因为这里论述的是主的国，即新天新地。耶利米书：<br />你们要建造房屋，住在其中；栽种田园，吃其中所产的。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶29.5.htm">29:5</a>）<br />此处的含义也一样。诗篇：<br />你们要赞美耶和华！敬畏耶和华，热爱祂的诫命的，这人便为有福！他家中有财富，有钱财；祂的公义存到永远！（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗112.1.htm">112:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗112.3.htm">3</a>）<br />“财富，有钱财”表聪明智慧、因而知识的财富和钱财；“他家中”即他里面。<br />“家或房屋”也有反面意义，如西番雅书：<br />我必察罚他们，他们心里说，耶和华必不降福，也不降祸。他们的财宝必成为掠物，他们的房屋必变为荒场；他们必建造房屋，却不得住在其内；栽种葡萄园，却不得喝所出的酒。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番1.12.htm">1:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/番1.13.htm">13</a>）<br />哈该书：<br />你们要上山取木料建造这殿。你们盼望多得，所得的却少。你们收到家中，我就吹去。这是为什么呢？耶和华说，因为我的殿荒凉，你们各人却顾自己的房屋（原文作奔）。所以为你们的缘故，天就不降甘露。（哈该书<a href="http://39-27.cn/该1.8.htm">1:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/该1.10.htm">10</a>）<br />“殿”表记忆的知识，虚假藉着推理由此而来。以赛亚书：<br />耶和华的葡萄园，就是以色列家。祸哉！那些以房接房、以田连田，以致不留余房的，只顾自己独居境内。必有许多又大又美的房屋成为荒凉，无人居住。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.7.htm">5:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.9.htm">9</a>）<br />此处“房”也表记忆的知识，虚假由此而来。阿摩司书：<br />看哪，耶和华出令，大房就被攻破，小屋就被打裂。马岂能在崖石上奔跑？人岂能在那里用牛耕种呢？你们却使公平变为苦胆，使公义的果子变为茵陈。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩6.11.htm">6:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩6.12.htm">12</a>）<br />此处“房屋”同样表虚假和衍生的邪恶，“马”表推理，“公平”表“变为苦胆”的真理，“公义的果子”表“变为茵陈”的良善。<br />因此，在圣言中，“家或房屋”处处表人的心智，聪明智慧理应居于其中。此处“法老的全家”表记忆的知识，藉此生出聪明，藉聪明生出智慧。所罗门为法老的女儿所造的宫室也具有类似含义（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上7.8.htm">7:8</a>等）。由于“家或房屋”表心智，聪明智慧居于其中，属于意愿的情感也居于其中，故在圣言中，“家或房屋”这个词具有广泛意义，至于它的具体含义，则可从它所论及的事物清楚可知。人本身也被称为“家或房屋”。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1488.</strong> The symbolism of and his household as the facts he had collected can be seen from the symbolism of a house or household here as facts that are being collected. Accumulating facts and using them to construct or "build" an outer self is much like building a house. Accordingly, houses and the building of houses{*1} have this same symbolism throughout the Word, as in Isaiah:<br />I am creating new heavens and a new earth. They will build houses and inhabit them. And they will plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them. They will not build, and another inhabit. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1488/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_65_17" target=_top>Isaiah 65:17</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1488/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_65_21-22" target=_top>21-22</a>)<br />A house here is a place where there is wisdom and understanding and so where goodness and truth are known, since it is talking about the Lord's kingdom 钬?that is to say, about new heavens and a new earth. In Jeremiah:<br />Build houses and live in them; and plant gardens and eat their produce. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1488/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_29_5" target=_top>Jeremiah 29:5</a>)<br />The meaning is the same. In David:<br />Happy is the man who fears Jehovah; in Jehovah's commandments he takes great pleasure. Wealth and riches are in his house, and his virtue will be standing forever. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1488/bible_king-james-version_psalms_112_1" target=_top>Psalms 112:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1488/bible_king-james-version_psalms_112_3" target=_top>3</a>)<br />The wealth and riches stand for the wealth and riches of wisdom and understanding and so for religious concepts, which are "in his house," that is, inside the person.<br />[2] Houses with an opposite meaning come up in Zephaniah:<br />I will exact punishment on those who say, "Jehovah has not done good and has not done evil." And their riches will become plunder, and their houses a ruin; and they will build houses and not live in them, and plant vineyards and not drink the wine. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1488/bible_king-james-version_zephaniah_1_12-13" target=_top>Zephaniah 1:12-13</a>)<br />In Haggai:<br />"Go up onto the mountain and bring wood and build a house.{*2} To look for much ... ! And here, it became little. And you brought it into [your] house and I blew it away. Why?" says Jehovah. "Because of my House, which has been deserted, while you go running each to your own house. Therefore the heavens above you have been shut off from their dew." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1488/bible_king-james-version_haggai_1_8" target=_top>Haggai 1:8</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1488/bible_king-james-version_haggai_1_9" target=_top>9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1488/bible_king-james-version_haggai_1_10" target=_top>10</a>)<br />A house here stands for facts from which we produce falsity by means of twisted logic. In Isaiah:<br />Doom to those attaching house to house; field to field they bring together, until there is no room and you live alone in the middle of the land. If many houses are not made desolate 钬?large ones, and good 钬?without any inhabitant, ... !{*3} Jehovah's vineyard is the house of Israel.{*4} (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1488/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_5_7" target=_top>Isaiah 5:7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1488/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_5_8" target=_top>8</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1488/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_5_9" target=_top>9</a>)<br />Here too the house stands for facts from which we produce falsities. In Amos:<br />Look! Jehovah is issuing commands, and he will strike the large house with cracks and the small house with crevices. Will horses run on rock? Will anyone plow it with oxen? For you have transformed integrity into poison, and the fruit of justice into wormwood. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1488/bible_king-james-version_amos_6_11-12" target=_top>Amos 6:11-12</a>)<br />The house again stands for falsity and the evil that falsity gives rise to; horses stand for skewed logic; integrity stands for truth that is transformed into poison; and the fruit of justice stands for virtues that are transformed into wormwood.<br />[3] Throughout the Word, then, houses stand for human minds, which ought to hold understanding and wisdom. Pharaoh's house here stands for the facts on which understanding and therefore wisdom are based. The house that Solomon built for Pharaoh's daughter (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1488/bible_king-james-version_1-kings_7_8" target=_top>1 Kings 7:8</a> and following verses) also has the same symbolism. Since houses stand for our minds, which contain understanding and wisdom, and which also contain the emotions that belong to our will, the symbolism of a house in the Word is broad. The particular symbolism can be deduced from the context in which it is mentioned. People themselves are also called houses.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The translation here assumes the reading domos, et aedificare domos ("houses and the building of houses") for the first edition's aedificare, et aedificare domos ("building and the building of houses"). [LHC]<br />{*2} The house in this context is the Temple at Jerusalem, which at the time of this prophet (Haggai) was in ruins and needed to be rebuilt. [LHC]<br />{*3} The implied completion to this oath beginning with the phrase "If many houses are not made desolate" would be some contrary-to-fact statement, such as "then I am not God." Threats with an "if" clause but no explicit "then" clause 钬?what could be called an "elliptical threat" 钬?are a fairly common feature of the Hebrew Bible. For some examples of this feature, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1488/bible_king-james-version_2-samuel_19_13" target=_top>2 Samuel 19:13</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1488/bible_king-james-version_1-kings_2_23" target=_top>1 Kings 2:23</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1488/bible_king-james-version_1-kings_19_2" target=_top>19:2</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1488/bible_king-james-version_2-kings_6_31" target=_top>2 Kings 6:31</a>. [LHC]<br />{*4} The material quoted here does not follow its biblical order. The last sentence is from verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1488/bible_king-james-version_genesis_12_7" target=_top>7</a>, the two before it are from verses <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1488/bible_king-james-version_genesis_12_8" target=_top>8</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1488/bible_king-james-version_genesis_12_9" target=_top>9</a>.

The third Latin edition describes these problems as "possibly a printer's error" (Swedenborg [1749-1756] 1949-1973), while Elliott (Swedenborg [1749-1756] 1983-1999) says that the last sentence was apparently "added as an afterthought."

And his house. That this signifies which He had collected, is evident from the signification of a "house," as being, in this place, the memory-knowledges that are collected. To collect memory-knowledges, 
and by their means frame the external man, and build it up, is not unlike building a house; and therefore such things are signified in many passages of the Word by "building," and by "building houses," 
as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     I create new heavens and a new earth; they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them; they shall not build and another 
inhabit (Isa. 65:17, 21-22); </p>
<p>here "houses" mean where there are wisdom and intelligence, thus where there are the knowledges of good and truth; for the Lord's kingdom is here treated of, namely, the 
new heavens and the new earth. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Build ye houses and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them (Jer. 29:5); </p>
<p>where the meaning is similar. In David: </p>
<p>     Blessed is 
the man that feareth Jehovah, that delighteth greatly in His commandments; wealth and riches are in his house, and his righteousness endureth forever (Ps. 112:1, 3); </p>
<p>where "wealth and riches" denote 
the wealth and riches of wisdom and intelligence, thus knowledges; which are "in his house," that is, are in him.  [2] "House" is used in the opposite sense in Zephaniah: </p>
<p>     I will visit upon them 
that say in their heart, Jehovah hath not done good, and hath not done evil; and their wealth shall be for a spoil, and their houses a desolation; and they shall build houses and shall not inhabit them, 
and they shall plant vineyards but shall not drink the wine thereof (Zeph. 1:12-13). In Haggai: </p>
<p>     Go up into the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house. Ye looked for much, and lo, it 
came to little; and ye brought it into the house, and I did blow it away. Why? saith Jehovah. Because of My house, which is deserted, while ye run everyone to his own house; therefore upon you are the 
heavens shut from dew (Hag. 1:8-10); </p>
<p>"houses" denote memory-knowledges by which, through reasoning, come falsities. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Woe unto them that join house to house, that cause field to draw 
near to field, till there be no place, and ye dwell alone in the midst of the land. Shall not many houses be for a desolation, great and good, without an inhabitant? The vineyard of Jehovah is the house 
of Israel (Isa. 5:7-9); </p>
<p>also denoting memory-knowledges by means of which come falsities. In Amos: </p>
<p>     Behold, Jehovah commandeth, and will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house 
with clefts. Shall horses run upon the rock? will one plow there with oxen? that ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood (Amos 6:11-12); </p>
<p>where "houses" denote 
in like manner falsities and the derivative evils; "horses," reasoning; "judgment," truths, which are "turned into gall;" and "the fruit of righteousness," goods which are "turned into wormwood." 
 [3] Thus throughout the Word, "houses" denote human minds, in which there should be intelligence and wisdom. In the passage before us, "the house of Pharaoh" denotes memory-knowledges by means of which 
comes intelligence, and thereby wisdom. The like is also signified by the house which Solomon built for the daughter of Pharaoh (1 Kings 7:8, etc.). Because "houses" denote minds, in which are intelligence 
and wisdom, and in which are affections belonging to the will, the word "house" in the Word is of a wide signification; but what its specific signification is, may be seen from the things of 
which it is predicated. Man himself is also called "a house."  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1488</b></p><p><b>1488.</b>
'And his house' means which He had gathered together. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'house' here as facts that are gathered together. Gathering facts together and by means of them raising and 
building up the external man is not unlike building a house, and therefore similar ideas are meant in various parts of the Word by 'building', and by 'building houses', as in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
I am creating 
new heavens and a new earth. They will build houses and inhabit them; and they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit. They will not build and another inhabit. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2065:17,%2021,%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 65:17, 21, 22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'houses' 
means where there are wisdom and intelligence, thus where there are the cognitions of good and truth, for the Lord's kingdom is the subject, that is, 'new heavens and a new earth'. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Build 
houses and inhabit them; and plant gardens and eat their fruit. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2029:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 29:5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the meaning is similar. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Blessed is the man who fears Jehovah, who delights greatly in His commandments! 
Wealth and riches are in his house, and his righteousness stands for ever. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20112:1,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 112:1, 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'wealth and riches' stands for the wealth and riches of wisdom and intelligence, thus for cognitions, 
which are 'in his house', that is, residing with him. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 'House' is also used in the contrary sense: in Zephaniah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will visit those who say in their hearts, Jehovah has not done good nor 
has He done evil; and their wealth will be for plunder, and their houses for desolation, and they will build [rouses and not inhabit them, and they will plant vineyards and not drink [their] wine. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zeph%201:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zeph 1:12, 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Haggai, </p>
<blockquote>
Go up into the mountain and bring wood and build the house. You looked for much, and behold it was little; and when you brought it home<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> I blew it away. For what reason? said 
Jehovah. Because of My house which has been left derelict while you run each to his own house. Therefore above you the heavens have withheld their dew. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hagg%201:8-10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hagg 1:8-10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Houses' stands for facts through 
which, by means of reasoning, falsities come. In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The vineyard of Jehovah is the house of Israel.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> Woe to those who join house to house, who add field to field until there is no room 
and you dwell alone in the midst of the land! Will not many houses be a desolation, large and good ones, without inhabitant? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%205:7-9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 5:7-9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'houses' stands for facts through which come falsities. 
In Amos, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, Jehovah commands, and He will smite the great house with breaches and the little house with clefts. Will horses run upon the rock? Will one plough there with oxen? that you 
turn judgement into poison and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%206:11,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 6:11, 12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here similarly 'houses' stands for falsities and derivative evils, 'horses' for reasoning, 'judgement' for truths 
which are 'turned into poison', and 'the fruits of righteousness' for goods which are 'turned into wormwood'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Thus in various parts of the Word 'houses' stands for human minds in which intelligence 
and wisdom ought to be present. Here 'the house of Pharaoh' stands for facts by means of which comes intelligence and by means of this wisdom. Similar things were also meant by 'the house which 
Solomon built for Pharaoh's daughter', <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 7:8 and following verses. Because 'a house' stands for minds that have intelligence and wisdom within them, and that have within them affections that 
belong to the will, therefore the word 'house' in the Word has a wide range of meaning, but what it means in a specific instance becomes clear from the things to which it has reference. In addition 
man himself is called 'a house'.

I Reg. vii 8 seq.  Quia domus pro mentibus in quibus intelligentia et sapientia et quibus affectiones quae sunt voluntatis, ideo vox 'domus' in Verbo latae significationis est, sed quid significat 
in specie, constare potest ab illis de quibus praedicatur; ipse homo quoque appellatur 'domus.' 	@1 I has only 8, 9, but vinea... Israelis is from v. 7. Possibly a printer's error.$ </p>
