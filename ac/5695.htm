<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5695节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5695.</strong>“他洗了脸”表它采取措施确保这一点，或它如此安排。这从“洗脸”的含义清楚可知，“洗脸”在此是指采取措施确保叫人看不出来；因为约瑟的脸洗过后，他便采取了措施确保他的泪痕叫人看不出来。至于这些事是何情形，蒙主的神性怜悯，我们将在下文予以阐述。在此必须说一说脸与内层的对应关系。脸是内层的外在代表，因为脸是以这种方式来设计的：内层可显现在脸上，如同显现在一面以代表性的方式反映事物的镜子里；并且别人能从脸上知道此人对自己持哪种心态；以致他在说话时，不仅通过自己的言语，还通过自己的脸展示自己的情绪。属于属天教会的绝大多数古人都有这样的脸；所有天使也有这样的脸，他们不愿向别人隐瞒他们所想的，因为他们只想着他们邻舍的幸福。他们也不会为了自己的缘故而隐藏渴望邻舍幸福的任何想法。<br />但地狱里的人当在天堂之光中被观之时，却没有对应于他们内层的脸，而是另有一张脸。原因在于，活在肉身期间，他们的脸向邻舍显示仁爱仅仅是为了自己的地位和名利；然而，他们从不渴望邻舍的幸福，除非这幸福与他们自己的一致。结果，他们脸上的表情与他们的内层不一致；有时这种不一致如此之大，以致敌意、仇恨、报复和杀人的欲望在里面，而他们脸上却仍流露出对邻舍的爱。由此可见现在人们的内层与外层之间的差异何等之大，他们采取这种做法是为了自己的利益。</p>

And he washed his faces. That this signifies that it so arranged, is evident from the signification of "washing the faces," as here being to arrange so as not to appear; for the face was washed that 
no trace of tears might appear; consequently it was arranged in this way. How the case is with these things will of the Lord's Divine mercy be told in the following pages. Here something must be said 
about the correspondence of the face with the interiors. The face is the external representative of the interiors, for the face is so formed that the interiors may appear in it as in a representative 
mirror, and that another may know from it of what mind the person is toward him; so that when he speaks he shows his feelings by his face as well as by his words. The most ancient people, who were of 
the celestial church, had a face like this; and all the angels have it, for they have no desire to conceal from others what they think, because they think well and only well toward the neighbor, nor have 
they any lurking thought of wishing well to the neighbor for the sake of themselves. But the infernals, when not seen in the light of heaven, have a different face from that which corresponds to their 
interiors. The reason is that in the life of the body their faces had shown charity toward the neighbor, merely for the sake of their own honor and gain, and yet they had never wished well to the 
neighbor except insofar as he favored them. The result is that the makeup of their faces is so much out of agreement with their interiors that sometimes enmities, hatreds, revenges, and murderous feeling 
are within, while their faces are made up so as to beam with love toward the neighbor. This shows how great at the present day is the disagreement between the interiors and the exteriors, resulting 
in the cultivation of such arts. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5695</b></p><p><b>5695.</b>
'And he washed his face' means that it took steps to ensure this. This is clear from the meaning of 'washing his face' here as taking steps to ensure that it remained unseen; for Joseph's face was washed, 
and so steps were taken by him to ensure that his tears remained unseen. The full implications of this will in the Lord's Divine mercy be stated further on; but let something be said at this point 
about the correspondence of a person's face with his interiors. His face is what is external serving to represent his interiors. For the face has been designed in such a way that a person's interiors 
may be seen there as if in a mirror that reflects things in a representative fashion; it has been so designed that another may know its owner's attitude of mind towards himself, so that the owner reveals 
his sentiments when he speaks not only through his speech but also through his face. This was the kind of face possessed by the most ancient people who belonged to the celestial Church, and it 
is the kind that all angels have. Angels have no wish to conceal from others anything they think, for they think solely of their neighbour's well-being. Nor do they have any thought hidden away which 
desires their neighbour's well-being for some selfish reason of their own. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 But those in hell, as long as they are not seen in the light of heaven, have a face other than the one that corresponds 
to their interiors. The reason for this is that during their lifetime they bore witness by means of their face to charity towards the neighbour solely for the sake of their own position and gain; they 
did not desire their neighbour's well being except insofar as it was identical with their own. Consequently the expression on their face is at variance with their interiors. Sometimes that variance 
is so great that feelings of enmity, hatred, and revenge, and the desire to murder are inwardly present, yet their face is set in such a way that love towards their neighbour is beaming from it. From 
this one may see how far people's interiors disagree at the present day with their exteriors, and why they resort to those kinds of practices to serve their own interests. </p>

`Et lavit facies suas':  quod significet quod disponeret ita, constat a significatione `lavare facies' quod hic sit disponere ita ut non appareat; lavabatur enim facies ne lacrimatio appareret, proinde 
ita disponebatur; (m)quomodo cum his se habet, in sequentibus, ex Divina Domini misericordia, dicetur; hic aliquid dicendum de correspondentia faciei cum interioribus :(n)  facies est externum interiorum 
repraesentativum, nam facies ita formata est ut interiora in illa sicut in speculo repraesentativo appareant, ac alius inde sciat qua mente sit erga se, sic ut cum {1}loquitur, manifestet sensa 
animi sui tam per loquelam quam per faciem; talem faciem habuerunt antiquissimi qui a caelesti Ecclesia fuerunt, et talem faciem habent omnes angeli, nam nihil volunt coram aliis celare quid cogitant, 
cogitant enim non nisi quam bene erga proximum, nec aliquam latentem cogitationem habent ut proximo velint bene propter se; [2]at infernales dum non in luce caeli apparent, aliam faciem habent quam 
quae interioribus correspondet; causa est quia in vita corporis testati sunt charitatem erga proximum solum sui honoris et lucri causa per faciem, et tamen nusquam voluerunt proximo bene nisi quantum 
sibi faveret; inde dispositio faciei eorum contra interiora, quandoque usque adeo ut inimicitiae, odia, vindictae, et cupiditas necandi {2}sint intus, et tamen facies disposita ut inde (x)eluceat amor 
erga illum.  Inde constare potest quantum hodie dissident interiora ab exterioribus; {3}quapropter talium ministeria ambiunt. @1 loquatur$ @2 sit$ @3 i imo homines ipsi norunt, quod talia quae mente 
celant sint contra ordinem, et talia quae facie manifestant, sint apparenter secundum ordinem illum:  nam omnis latenter afficitur eo, ac interius apud se aestimat quod sincerum, et quod mirum, etiam mali;$ </p>
