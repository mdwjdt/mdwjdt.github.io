<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9152节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9152.</strong>“就要加倍赔偿”表完全恢复。这从“赔偿”和“加倍”的含义清楚可知：“赔偿”是指恢复（参看<a href="9087.htm">9087</a>节）；“加倍”是指完全（<a href="9103.htm">9103</a>节）。本节和接下来的几节经文，直到14节，在内义上论述的主题是与一个人同在的信之真理的丧失，因而他的属灵生命的丧失，以及它的恢复；因为一个人通过信之真理被带入仁之良善，并变得属灵。不过，接下来这几节经文的内义所论述的事大部分不为人知。原因是，人们不知道何为属灵的生命，因而不知道属灵的生命是一种内层生命，不同于外层的属世生命。人们也不知道主通过在仁之良善里面接受信之真理而将属灵的生命赐给一个人。因此，关于属灵生命的丧失和它的恢复所说的这些事会陷入一个人里面的幽暗之中，因为它们在他完全不知道的事情之列。然而，这些事却构成天使的智慧，因为它们适合天使所在的光。因此，当一个处于信之良善的教会成员阅读圣言时，天使就会依附于他，并以他为乐，因为他们以从主通过圣言流入他们的智慧为乐。天堂以这种方式与人联结；没有圣言，这种联结是不可能的。因为圣言具有这样的性质：在原文中，它的一点一划无不触动天使，并将天使与人类联结起来。我可以肯定，这是千真万确的事实，因为这个事实已经从天堂被指示给我。</p>

He shall repay double. That this signifies restoration to the full, is evident from the signification of "repaying," as being restoration (see n. 9087); and from the signification of "double," as being 
to the full (n. 9103). In this verse, and in those which follow, as far as verse 14, the subject treated of in the internal sense is the loss of the truth of faith with a man, thus the loss of spiritual 
life, and its restoration; for by means of the truths of faith a man is brought into the good of charity, and becomes spiritual. But the things treated of in the internal sense in what now follows 
are for the most part unknown to man. The reason is that it is not known what spiritual life is, thus neither that spiritual life is an interior life distinct from the natural life, which is exterior. 
Neither is it known that spiritual life is given by the Lord to man through the reception of the truth of faith in the good of charity. Consequently what is said about the loss of this spiritual life 
and its restoration falls into thick darkness with a man, because it falls among things of which he has no knowledge. Nevertheless such things make angelic wisdom, for they are suited to the light 
in which the angels are; and therefore when a man of the church who is in the good of faith reads the Word, angels adjoin themselves to him, and are delighted in the man, because of the wisdom which 
then inflows to them through the Word from the Lord. From this is the conjunction of heaven with man, which would not be possible without the Word. For the Word is such that there is not even a point 
or a jot in its original tongue which does not affect the angels, and conjoin them with man. That this is the case I can assever, because it has been shown me from heaven. </p>

'He shall repay double' means restoration to the complete amount. This is clear from the meaning of 'making repayment' as undertaking restoration, dealt with in <a href="9087.htm">9087</a>, [<a href="9097.htm">9097</a>;] and from the meaning of 
'double' as to the complete amount, dealt with in <a href="9103.htm">9103</a>. The present verse and those that follow down to verse 14 deal in the internal sense with a person's loss of the truth of faith, and so with his 
loss of spiritual life, and the restoration of it; for the truths of faith are the means by which a person is brought to the good of charity and made spiritual. But these matters dealt with in the internal 
sense of the verses that come immediately after this are for the most part unknown to a person. The reason for this is that people do not know what spiritual life is, nor therefore that this life 
is life on a more internal level, distinct and separate from natural life, which is that on a more external level. Nor do people know that the Lord imparts spiritual life to a person through his acceptance 
of the truth of faith within the good of charity. So it is that the matters stated regarding the loss of that life and the restoration of it fall into thick darkness in a person because they are 
among things he knows nothing about. Yet such matters constitute angelic wisdom, for they are suited to the light in which angels live. When therefore a member of the Church in whom the good of faith 
is present reads the Word, the angels attach themselves to the person and take delight in him because they delight in the wisdom which flows into them from the Lord through the Word. In this way heaven 
is linked to mankind; and without the Word that link would not exist. For the nature of the Word is such that not even a tittle or a jot of it in the original language fails to touch angels' affections 
and link the angels to mankind. I can positively declare this to be so because I have been shown it from heaven.  </p>

</p><b>9152.</b>
`Rependet duplum': quod significet restitutionem ad plenum, constat ex significatione `rependere' quod sit restitutio, de qua n. 9087, et ex significatione `dupli' quod sit ad plenum, de qua n. 9103. 
 Agitur in hoc versu et in sequentibus usque ad {2} 14 in sensu interno de jactura veri fidei apud hominem, ita de jactura vitae {3} spiritualis et de ejus restitutione, nam homo per vera fidei introducitur 
ad bonum charitatis et fit spiritualis; sed haec de quibus in nunc sequentibus in sensu interno agitur {4} sunt quoad plurimam partem ignota homini; causa est quia non scitur quid vita spiritualis, 
ita nec quod haec vita sit interior vita, quae distincta (o)est a vita naturali, quae exterior; neque scitur quod illa vita detur homini a Domino per receptionem veri fidei in bono charitatis; 
inde est quod quae dicuntur de jactura vitae illius et de ejus restitutione, cadant {5} in caliginem apud hominem quia inter illa quae non sciuntur; sed usque talia faciunt sapientiam angelicam, adaequata 
enim sunt luci in qua angeli sunt; quapropter cum homo Ecclesiae qui in bono fidei est legit Verbum, adjungunt se ei angeli et delectantur homine, quia sapientia quae per Verbum ad illos tunc a Domino 
influit; inde est conjunctio caeli cum homine, quae nulla foret absque Verbo; Verbum enim tale est ut ne quidem apex aut iota sit in lingua ejus originali quae non afficit angelos et conjungit illos 
homini; quod ita sit, asseverare possum quia ostensum est a caelo. @1 in IT$ @2 i vers.$ @3 i ejus$ @4 haec de quibus in sensu interno in hoc versu et in aliquibus sequentibus agitur$ @5 cadant
