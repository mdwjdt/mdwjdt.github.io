<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>243.</strong>对于上古时代的属天之人，身体感官是服务内在的，除此之外，他们并不关心。当人开始陷入我欲，就将感官置于内在之前。于是，感官与内在分离，转而服务肉体，从而遭到谴责。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]243.</strong> In the earliest, heavenly sort of people, the sensory capacities of the body served the inner self obediently, and beyond that they had no interest in those capacities. After they began to love themselves, though, they put sense experience ahead of the inner self. As a result their senses were separated [from anything higher], turned to serving the body, and so were condemned to hell. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 243</b></p><p><b>243.</b>
In the most ancient celestial men the sensuous things of the body were of such a character as to be compliant and subservient to their internal man, and beyond this they did not care for them. But after 
they had begun to love themselves, they set the things of sense before the internal man, and therefore those things were separated, became corporeal, and so were condemned. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 243</b></p><p><b>243.</b>
Within the most ancient celestial man the sensory powers of the body were subject to and served the internal man. Beyond that they were not concerned with those powers. But after they began to love themselves, 
they set the powers of the senses above the internal man. Consequently those powers were separated, became bodily, and so were condemned.  </p>

</p><b>243.</b>
In antiquissimo caelesti homine sensualia corporis talia erant ut obsequerentur et servirent interno eorum homini, et praeterea illa non curabant; sed postquam amare se coeperunt, praeferebant sensualia 
interno homini; quare separabantur, et facta corporea, et sic damnata. </p>
