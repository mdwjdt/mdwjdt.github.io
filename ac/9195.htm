Verses 20-23. And a sojourner thou shalt not afflict, and shalt not oppress; for ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt. Any widow and orphan ye shall not afflict. If afflicting thou shalt afflict him, 
so that crying he shall cry unto Me, hearing I will hear his cry; and Mine anger shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your women shall become widows, and your sons orphans. "And 
a sojourner thou shalt not afflict, and shalt not oppress," signifies that those who wish to be instructed in the truths and goods of faith are not to be infested with falsities of doctrine and evils 
of life; "for ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt," signifies that they were protected from falsities and evils when infested by the infernals; "any widow," signifies those who are in good without 
truth, and yet long for truth; "and orphan," signifies those who are in truth, and not yet in good, and nevertheless long for good; "ye shall not afflict," signifies that they are not to be defrauded; 
"if afflicting thou shalt afflict him," signifies if they are defrauded; "so that crying he shall cry unto Me," signifies supplication to the Lord for aid; "hearing I will hear his cry," signifies that 
they are to be aided; "and Mine anger shall wax hot," signifies the state of those who do this; "and I will kill you with the sword," signifies that they would deprive themselves of good and truth 
through falsities; "and your women shall become widows," signifies that the goods with them will perish; "and your sons orphans," signifies that then at the same time truths will perish. </p>

Verses 21-24 And a sojourner you shall not afflict and shall not oppress, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt. Any widow or orphan you shall not afflict. If you do indeed afflict him, and if 
he surely cries out to Me, I will surely hear his cry. And My anger will blaze up, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives will become widows, and your sons orphans. </p>
<p>'And a sojourner you 
shall not afflict and shall not oppress' means that those who wish to receive instruction in the truths and forms of the good of faith must not be molested with falsities of faith<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> or evils of life. 
'For you were sojourners in the land of Egypt' means that they had been protected from falsities and evils when they were molested by those from hell. 'Any widow' means those who have good that is without 
truth, and still have a desire for truth. 'Or orphan' means those who possess truth but not as yet good, and still have a desire for good. 'You shall not afflict' means that they are not to be defrauded 
of them. 'If you do indeed afflict him' means if they are defrauded of them. 'And if he surely cries out to Me' means pleading to the Lord for help. 'I will surely hear their cry' means that 
they are to receive help. 'And My anger will blaze up' means the state of those who do that thing. 'And I will kill you with the sword' means that they deprive themselves of goodness and truth through 
falsities. 'And your wives will become widows' means that forms of good with them will perish. 'And your sons orphans' means that at the same time truths will do so.

Vers. 20-23.  Et peregrinum non affliges, et non opprimes, quia peregrini fuistis in terra Aegypti.  Ullam viduam et orphanum non affligetis.  Si affligendo afflixeris illum, quod si [clamando] clamaverit

quod qui in veris et bonis fidei instrui volunt non falsis doctrinae ac {1} malis vitae infestandi [sint]: `quia peregrini fuistis in terra Aegypti' significat quod a falsis et malis tutati sint 
cum infestati ab infernalibus: `ullam viduam' significat qui in bono absque vero sunt et usque desiderant verum: `et orphanum' (x)significat qui in vero sunt et nondum in bono, et usque desiderant bonum:
