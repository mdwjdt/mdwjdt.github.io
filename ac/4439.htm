<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4439节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4439.</strong>“雅各听见示剑玷污了他的女儿底拿”表不合法的结合，也就是说，与此处“雅各”所代表的外在教会所拥有的真理情感的错误结合。这从“玷污”的含义，以及“底拿”和“雅各”的代表清楚可知：“玷污”是指不合法的结合，因为婚姻表示一种合法的结合（参看<a href="4434.htm">4434</a>节） ，因此对它们的玷污就表示不合法的结合（参看<a href="4433.htm">4433</a>节）；“底拿”是指对信的一切事物的情感，以及由这种情感所产生的教会（<a href="4427.htm">4427</a>节）；“雅各”在此是指外在的古教会。“雅各”在此之所以表示外在的古教会，是因为这教会要建立在他的后代当中；事实上，如果他的后代接受了存在于古人当中的内层真理，该教会早就建立了。该教会在此由雅各来代表，这一点从本章的整个思路也能明显看出来，因为雅各并没有参与他儿子重击这城并杀害哈抹和示剑的计划；因此他对西缅和利未说：“你们连累我，使我在这地的居民中有了臭名”（34:30）；并且他死前说了这样的预言：<br />不要让我的灵魂进入他们的隐秘处，不要让我的荣耀参与他们的集会；因为他们在怒中杀人，任意砍断牛的腿筋。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.6.htm">49:6</a>）<br />此外在圣言的许多其它经文中，“雅各”也代表外在的古教会（<a href="422.htm">422</a>，<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>节）。“雅各”之所以代表这个教会，是因为就至高意义而言，他代表外在教会所对应的主的神性属世层。而他的“儿子们”则表示他的后代，他们在他们自己当中毁灭了存在于古人当中的真理，由此摧毁了要构成教会之物；所导致的后果是，他们当中只存留了教会的代表（参看<a href="4281.htm">4281</a>，<a href="4288.htm">4288</a>，<a href="4289.htm">4289</a>，<a href="4303.htm">4303</a>节）。</p>

And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter. That this signifies a conjunction not legitimate, namely, with the affection of the truth that belonged to the external church here represented 
by Jacob, is evident from the signification of "to defile," as being a conjunction not legitimate, for by marriages is signified a conjunction that is legitimate (see n. 4434), hence by their "defilement" 
is signified conjunction not legitimate (n. 4433); from the representation of Dinah, as being the affection of all things of faith, and the church thence derived (n. 4427); and from the representation 
of Jacob, who here is the external Ancient Church. That by "Jacob" is here signified the external Ancient Church is because this church was to be instituted among his descendants, and would have 
been instituted if his descendants had received the interior truths that existed among the ancients. That this church is here represented by Jacob is evident also from the connection in this chapter, 
for he was not in the plot with his sons to smite the city and kill Hamor and Shechem; and therefore he said to Simeon and Levi, "Ye have troubled me to make me stink to the inhabitant of the land" 
(verse 30); and in his prophetic utterance before his death, "Let not my soul come into their secret, in their congregation let not my glory be united; because in their anger they slew a man, and in their 
pleasure they unstrung an ox" (Gen. 49:6). Moreover in very many passages in the Word the external Ancient Church is represented by Jacob (n. 422, 4286). The reason why Jacob represents this church 
is that in the supreme sense he represents the Lord's Divine natural, to which the external church corresponds. But by his "sons" are signified his descendants, who extinguished in themselves the truth 
that existed among the ancients, and thus destroyed that which was of the church, the result being that only its representative remained with them (see n. 4281, 4288, 4289, 4303). </p>

'Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter' means a wrongful joining together, that is to say, a wrongful joining to the affection for truth which the external Church represented here by 'Jacob' 
possessed. This is clear from the meaning of 'defiling' as a wrongful joining together, for by 'marriages' is meant a rightful joining together, <a href="4434.htm">4434</a>, and therefore by the defilement of them a wrongful 
one, concerning which see <a href="4433.htm">4433</a>; from the representation of 'Dinah' as the affection for all things of faith, also the Church arising from that affection, dealt with in <a href="4427.htm">4427</a>; and from the representation 
of 'Jacob', who at this point is the external Ancient Church. The reason why Jacob' at this point means the external Ancient Church is that such a Church was to have been established among his 
descendants, and would in fact have been. established if those descendants had received the interior truths which existed among the Ancients. Jacob's representation of that Church at this point is also 
evident from the train of thought in this chapter, for he had no part in his sons' plan to smite the city and kill Hamor and Shechem, a deed which was also the reason for his telling Simeon and Levi, </p>
<blockquote>
You 
have brought trouble on me, by making me stink to the inhabitant of the land. Verse 30;
</blockquote>
<p> and in the prophetical utterance he made before his death, </p>
<blockquote>
Into their secret place let my soul 
not come; in their congregation let not my glory be united; for in their anger they killed a man, and in their pleasure they hamstrung an ox. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2049:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 49:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And there are very many other places in the 
Word besides these in which 'Jacob' represents the external Ancient Church, <a href="422.htm">422</a>, <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>. The reason why 'Jacob' represents that Church is that in the highest sense he represents the Lord's Divine Natural, 
to which the external Church corresponds. His sons however mean his descendants who annihilated truth known to the Ancients as this existed among themselves, and in so doing destroyed that which was 
to constitute the Church, so that only that which was the representative of it remained with them, <a href="4281.htm">4281</a>, <a href="4288.htm">4288</a>, <a href="4289.htm">4289</a>, <a href="4303.htm">4303</a>. </p>

`Jacob audivit quod polluerit Dinam filiam suam': quod significet conjunctionem non legitimam, nempe cum affectione veri, quod Ecclesiae externae per `Jacobum' hic repraesentatae, constat ex significatione 
`polluere' quod sit conjunctio non legitima; per `conjugia' enim significatur conjunctio legitima, n. 4434, inde per `pollutionem eorum' significatur conjunctio non legitima, de qua videatur 
n. 4433; ex repraesentatione `Dinae' quod sit affectio omnium fidei et Ecclesia inde, de qua n. 4427; et ex repraesentatione `Jacobi,' qui hic est Ecclesia Antiqua externa.  Quod per `Jacobum' 
significetur hic Ecclesia Antiqua externa, est quia illa Ecclesia erat instituenda apud posteros ejus, ac instituta fuisset, si posteri recepissent vera interiora quae fuerunt apud antiquos; quod 
per `Jacobum' illa Ecclesia hic repraesentetur, patet quoque ex serie in hoc capite, non enim fuit in consilio cum filiis suis quod percuterent urbem, et occiderent Hamorem et Shechemum; quapropter 
etiam dixit ad Shimeonem et Levi, `Perturbastis me ad fetere faciendum me habitatori terrae,' vers. 30; et in prophetico ante mortem,           In arcanum eorum ne veniat anima mea, in congregatione  
    eorum ne uniatur gloria mea, (o)quia in ira sua occiderunt      virum, et in complacito suo enervarunt bovem, Gen. xlix 6; </p>
<p>et praeterea in Verbo in plerisque locis per `Jacobum' {1} repraesentatur 
Antiqua Ecclesia externa, n. 422, 4286; causa quod Jacob illam {2} repraesentet, est quia in supremo sensu repraesentat Divinum Naturale Domini, cui Ecclesia externa correspondet: per `filios' 
autem ejus significantur posteri, qui verum apud antiquos apud se exstinxerunt, et sic destruxerunt id quod Ecclesiae esset, remanente sic apud illos solum repraesentativo ejus, (o)de quo n. 4281,
