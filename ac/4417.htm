<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4417节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4417.</strong>有一次，我与灵人谈论生命，大意是：人凭自己根本没有任何生命可言，而是从主接受生命，尽管他似乎凭自己活着（对比<a href="4320.htm">4320</a>节）。首先我们谈论了何为生命，即生命在于理解力和意愿；由于一切理解皆与真理有关，一切意愿皆与良善有关（<a href="4409.htm">4409</a>节），所以对真理的明智理解和对良善的意愿就是生命。但一些推理灵（有些灵人不得不被称为推理者，因为他们总是推理某事是否真实，这种人绝大部分在一切真理上处于模糊状态）回答说，那些没有对真理的明智理解和对良善的意愿之人仍具有生命；事实上，他们相信他们比其他所有人都拥有更真实的生命。但我蒙引导回答他们说，恶者的生命在他们看来的确像是生命，但这是一种被称为属灵死亡的生命。我还告诉他们，他们从以下考虑能认识到这一点，即：如果理解真理和意愿良善构成来自神性的生命，那么理解虚假和意愿邪恶就不可能构成生命。因为邪恶与虚假是生命本身的对立面。<br />为叫他们信服这一切，他们被指示自己的生命是何性质。当显为可见时，这生命看似炭火发出的充满烟雾的光。当居于这劣质之光时，他们只以为其思维和意愿的生命是那里唯一的生命，并且因以下事实而如此认为：他们根本看不见对真理的理解之光，也就是生命本身的光。因为他们一进入这光，自己的劣质之光就变暗，以致他们根本什么也看不清，因而什么也领悟不了。他们还被指示那时因着移除他们从虚假所得的快乐，其生命的状态变成什么样子；在来世，这种移除通过与相联的灵人分离实现。一旦分离，他们看上去脸色苍白，就像死尸的脸，以致他们可被称为死亡的形像。关于动物的生命，蒙主的神性怜悯，这个主题会有详细论述。</p>

I was once conversing with spirits concerning life - that no one has any life from himself, but from the Lord, although he may seem to live from himself (compare n. 4320). First of all we spoke of what 
life is, namely, that it is to understand and to will; and as all understanding bears relation to truth, and all willing to good (n. 4409), that the intelligence of truth and the will of good are life. 
But some reasoning spirits made reply (for there are spirits who are to be called reasoners, because they reason about everything as to whether it is so, and such are for the most part in obscurity 
in regard to all truth), and said that those who are in no intelligence of truth and will of good nevertheless live, and in fact they preeminently believe that they live. But it was given to answer 
them that the life of the evil does indeed appear to them like life, but nevertheless it is the life which is called spiritual death, as they might know from the consideration that as to understand truth 
and to will good are life from the Divine, it follows that to understand falsity and to will evil cannot be life, because evils and falsities are contrary to life itself.  [2] To convince them they 
were shown the quality of their life, which when seen appeared like the light from a coal fire mingled with smoke. When they are in this light, they cannot but suppose that the life of their thought 
and of their will is the only life there is, and this the more from the fact that the light of the intelligence of truth, which is that of life itself, cannot appear to them at all, for the moment 
they come into this light their own light becomes dark, so that they can see nothing at all, thus neither can they perceive anything. They were further shown what was then the state of their life, by 
the withdrawal of the delight they had from what is false, which in the other life is effected by separating the associate spirits. On this being done they appeared with ghastly faces, like those of the 
dead, so that they might have been called images of death. But as regards the life of animals, of the Lord's Divine mercy this subject shall receive particular treatment. </p>

I once held a conversation with spirits about life, to the effect that no one has any life at all of himself but receives it from the Lord, even though he does seem to live of himself; compare <a href="4320.htm">4320</a>. 
The conversation centred first around what life is - that it consists in having the mental powers of understanding and will; and as understanding is altogether a matter of comprehending what is true and 
will is altogether a matter of desiring what is good, <a href="4409.htm">4409</a>, it is in an intelligent understanding of what is true and in a will desiring what is good that life consists. But some spirits then spoke 
who were reasoners; for spirits exist who must be called reasoners because they always reason whether something is really true, and who for the most part dwell in obscurity so far as all truth is concerned. 
Some spirits, as I say, then spoke, who declared that those without any intelligent understanding of truth or any will desiring what is good do nevertheless have life. Indeed such people, they 
said, believe that they have life more truly than all others. I was led to say in reply to them that the life of the evil does indeed look to them like life, but this is the life that is called spiritual 
death. I also told them that they could recognize this from the consideration that if understanding truth and desiring good constitute life from the Divine, then understanding falsity and desiring 
evil cannot constitute life since evils and falsities are the opposites of life itself. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 To convince them of this they were shown what their own life was like. When presented visually it was seen 
as smoke-filled light emitted from a charcoal fire. While dwelling in that inferior light they cannot do other than suppose that the life of their thought and of their will is the only life there 
is, all the more so from the fact that the light of the understanding of truth, which is the light of life itself, cannot be seen by them at all. For as soon as they enter that light their own inferior 
light becomes darkened, so much so that they cannot see anything distinctly, and so cannot perceive anything either. They were also shown what their state of life was like at that time by the removal 
of the delight they derived from falsity, which removal is effected in the next life by separating them from the spirits in whose community they dwell. Once this was done, they appeared with pallid 
faces, like those of corpses, so that one might have called them death masks. Regarding the life of animals however, this will in the Lord's Divine mercy be dealt with as a separate subject. </p>

Sermo fuit cum spiritibus quondam de vita, quod nempe nemo aliquid vitae a se habeat, sed a Domino, tametsi videatur vivere a se, conferatur n. 4320; et tunc primum `sermo fuit' quid vita, quod nempe 
sit intelligere et velle, et quia omne intelligere se refert ad verum et omne velle ad bonum, n. 4409, quod intelligentia veri et voluntas boni sit vita.  Sed spiritus ratiocinatores dicebant; 
 (m)sunt enim spiritus qui dicendi `sunt' ratiocinatores quia de omnibus num ita sit, ratiocinantur, illi utplurimum in obscuro sunt de omni veritate,' `dicebant inquam' quod usque qui in nulla intelligentia 
veri et voluntate boni sunt, vivant, immo credant se prae aliis vivere; sed respondere illis datum quod vita malorum appareat quidem illis sicut vita, sed usque quod sit vita quae vocatur 
mors spiritualis, quod scire possent ex eo cum intelligere verum et velle bonum sit vita a Divino, tunc quod intelligere falsum et velle malum non possit esse vita, quia mala et falsa {1} contraria 
ipsi vitae sunt; [2] ut evincerentur, ostensum est qualis vita eorum, quae cum visa apparuit similis lumini ex igne carbonario cui intermixtum fumosum; in quo lumine cum sunt, opinari non aliter 
possunt quam quod vita (c)eorum cogitationis et (c)eorum voluntatis sit unice vita, et adhuc magis ex eo quod lux intelligentiae veri, quae est ipsius vitae, illis prorsus non apparere possit; ut 
primum enim in lucem illam veniunt, fit lumen illorum tenebricosum, adeo ut plane {2} nihil videre possint, ita quoque nihil percipere; ostensum quoque qualis status vitae eorum tunc erat, per abstractionem 
jucundi eorum ex falso, quod in altera vita fit per separationem spirituum quorum in societate sunt, quo facto, apparebant facie lurida, sicut cadavera, ut dici potuissent mortis effigies. 
 De animalium autem vita, singillatim, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, agetur. {3}      @1 malum et falsum$      @2 prorsus$      @3 This is a later insertion squeezed in at end of [ ].  Note that 
the discussion is `quid vita?' but that only human life is dealt with.$ </p>
