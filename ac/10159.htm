<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10159节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>关于星空中的第二个星球（续）<br /><strong>10159</strong>.我既与这个星球的灵人谈论了不可见和可见的神，就必须在此提一提，宇宙中几乎所有人都拜可见形式的神，事实上以一个人的形式来想象祂，他们这样做是本能的。使得他们本能地如此行的，是来自天堂的流注，因为说来奇妙，一直被提升到第三层天堂的气场中的天使对这个问题拥有一个清晰的觉察。原因在于，第三层天堂里的所有天使都住在对主的爱中，由此可以说住在主里面；因为那里的天使所享有的那种觉察力来自天堂的秩序和流注。事实上，天堂整体上类似一个人，这从前面许多章节末尾关于大人的说明可以看出来（参看<a href="10030.htm">10030</a>e节提到的地方）。天堂整体上类似一个人，这一点源于主的神性人身，因为主以祂的人身流入天堂，创造它，将其塑造成祂自己的样式。不过，对那些通过自己的聪明根除了这个本能观念的人来说，这个奥秘是难以理解的。</p>

CONTINUATION ABOUT THE SECOND EARTH IN THE STARRY HEAVEN. As I have spoken with the spirits of that earth about the invisible and visible God, I may mention that almost all in the universe worship God 
under a visible form, and in fact in their idea under the human form, and that this is implanted in them. It is by virtue of influx from heaven that it is implanted in them, for wonderful to say the 
angels who are raised up in the sphere of the third heaven, come into a plain perception about this subject. The reason is that all in that heaven are in the love of the Lord, and from this are as it 
were in the Lord, and because all perception, such as belongs to the angels there, is from the order and influx of heaven; for heaven in its whole complex bears relation to a man, as can be seen from 
what has been shown about heaven as the Grand Man, at the end of many chapters (see the places cited in n. 10030). That heaven in its whole complex bears relation to a man, is from the Divine Human 
of the Lord; for from this the Lord flows into heaven, makes it, and forms it according to His own likeness. But this secret can with difficulty be comprehended by those who through their own intelligence 
have extirpated in themselves this implanted idea. </p>

THE SECOND PLANET OUT IN SPACE - continued  </p>
<p>Seeing that I talked about God the invisible and the visible to them, I must mention here that almost everyone in the universe worships God under the visible 
form and indeed visualizes Him in a human form, and that their doing so is instinctive. What makes their doing so instinctive is the influence from heaven, for - and this is remarkable - angels 
who are raised all the way up into the sphere of the third heaven come to have a clear perception of this matter. The reason why they do so is that all in that heaven dwell in the love of the Lord and 
therefore so to speak in the Lord, and that the kind of perception enjoyed by the angels there is all a product of the order and flow of heaven. For heaven as a complete whole resembles a single human 
being, as may be seen from what has been shown at the ends of a number of chapters regarding heaven as the Grand Man, see the places referred to in <a href="10030.htm">10030</a>(end). The resemblance of heaven as a complete 
whole to a single human being has its origin in the Lord's Divine Human, for with His Human the Lord flows into heaven, creates it, and fashions it into a likeness of Himself. But this arcanum is scarcely 
intelligible to those who through their self-intelligence have rooted out that instinctive impulse.  </p>

Continuatio de Secunda Tellure in Caelo Astrifero </p>
<p>Quoniam de Deo invisibili et visibili cum illis locutus sum, memorare licet quod paene omnes in universo colant Deum sub forma visibili, 
et quidem in idea sua sub forma humana, et quod hoc insitum sit; quod insitum sit, est ex influxu e caelo, nam, quod memorabile, angeli qui elevantur usque in sphaeram tertii caeli, in perceptionem manifestam 
de eo veniunt; causa est quia omnes in eo caelo in amore Domini sunt, et inde quasi in Domino; et quia omnis perceptio, qualis est angelis ibi, est ex ordine et ex fluxu caeli; caelum enim in 
toto suo complexu refert unum hominem, ut constare potest ex illis quae de caelo ut Maximo Homine ad finem plurium capitum ostensa sunt videantur loca citata n. 10,030 fin.; quod caelum in toto suo complexu 
referat unum hominem, est ex Divino Humano Domini, ex hoc enim influit Dominus in caelum facit illud, et format ad Sui similitudinem.  Sed hoc arcanum aegre capi potest ab illis qui insitum hoc 
per propriam intelligentiam apud se exstirpaverunt. </p>
