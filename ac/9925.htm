<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9925节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9925.</strong>“亚伦供职的时候”表当进行敬拜、传福音时。这从“供职”的含义清楚可知，当论及代表主的亚伦时，“供职”是指敬拜和传福音。这种敬拜是指代表源于爱之良善和信之真理的敬拜的一切事物。因为源于这些的敬拜是真正的敬拜，而没有它们的敬拜就像没有核仁的外壳，像没有灵魂的身体。犹太和以色列民族当中的敬拜就是这个样子，因为他们的敬拜只不过是代表内在事物，如前所述，这些内在事物就是爱与信的事物。即便如此，主仍规定，这种敬拜要在天上被感知到，以便与人类的一个联结可以通过它得以建立；事实上，不是通过内在事物建立，而是通过内在事物与外在事物的对应关系建立（关于这个主题，可参看<a href="9320.htm">9320</a>e，<a href="9380.htm">9380</a>节所提到的地方）。这种敬拜就是亚伦供职所表示的。<br />之所以也表示传福音，是因为传福音表示与主有关的圣言里的一切事物和代表主的敬拜里的一切事物。因为传福音就是宣告关于主、祂的降临，以及来自祂的事，即属于救恩和永生之事的真理。由于圣言的一切事物在其至内在意义上唯独与主有关，而且敬拜的一切事物都代表主，所以整部圣言都是福音，照圣言中的吩咐所行的一切敬拜同样都是福音。由于祭司主持敬拜，也给予教导，所以他们的“供职”表示敬拜和传福音。</p>

To minister. That this signifies when engaged in worship and in evangelization, is evident from the signification of "ministering," when said of Aaron, by whom is represented the Lord, as being worship 
and evangelization. By "worship" is signified everything that is representative of worship from the good of love and the truths of faith; for the worship that is from these is truly worship, whereas 
worship without these is like a shell without a kernel, and like a body without a soul. And yet such was the worship with the Jewish and Israelitish nation, for this worship merely represented internal 
things, which, as has been said, are of love and faith. Nevertheless the Lord provided that such worship should be perceived in the heavens, and that thus by means of it there should be effected the 
conjunction of heaven with man; not indeed through internal things, but through correspondences with external things (on which subject see the places cited in n. 9320, 9380). This is the worship that 
is signified by "the ministry of Aaron." [2] That evangelization is also signified is because by evangelization are meant all things in the Word which treat of the Lord, and all things in worship 
which represented Him. For evangelization is annunciation about the Lord, His coming, and the things that are from Him which belong to salvation and eternal life. And as all things of the Word in its 
inmost sense treat solely of the Lord, and all things of worship represented Him, therefore the whole Word is the Evangel, in like manner all worship that was done according to the things commanded in 
the Word. And because the priests presided over the worship, and likewise taught, therefore by their "ministry" were signified worship and evangelization. </p>

'When he ministers' means while engaged in worship and preaching the gospel. This is clear from the meaning of 'ministering' - when said of Aaron, who represents the Lord - as worship and preaching the 
gospel. By this worship is meant everything representative of that worship which springs from the good of love and the truths of faith. For worship that springs from these is indeed worship; but worship 
devoid of them is like the shell without the nut, and like the body without the soul. This is what the worship among the Jewish and Israelite nation was like, since their worship did no more than 
represent inward things, which are those of love and faith, as has been stated. Even so, the Lord saw to it that such worship should be discerned in the heavens, so that through it a link with mankind 
might be established, not through inner things but through the correspondences of these with outward things, regarding which, see the places referred to in <a href="9320.htm">9320</a> (end), <a href="9380.htm">9380</a>. This worship is what is 
meant by Aaron's ministering.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why preaching the gospel is also meant is that preaching the gospel implies all those things in the Word which have to do with the Lord, and all those 
in worship which served to represent Him. For preaching the gospel involves declaring the truth about the Lord, about His Coming, and about the things of which He is the author, namely things that belong 
to salvation and eternal life. And since everything in the Word in its inmost sense has to do solely with the Lord, and also everything in worship served to represent Him, the whole of the Word is 
the gospel, as likewise was all the worship which was performed in accord with what was commanded in the Word. And since the priests had charge of worship, and also gave instruction, worship and preaching 
the gospel were meant by their ministry.  </p>

`Ad ministrandum':  quod significet dum in cultu et  evangelizatione, constat ex significatione `ministrare' cum de Aharone, per quem repraesentatur Dominus, quod sit cultus et evangelizatio; per cultum 
significatur omne repraesentativum {1}cultus ex bono amoris et veris fidei, nam cultus qui ex illis vere est cultus, {2} at cultus absque illis est sicut crusta absque nucleo, et sicut corpus absque 
anima; talis usque cultus erat apud gentem Judaicam et Israeliticam, nam repraesentabat solum interna, quae, ut dictum est, sunt amoris et fidei; sed usque providebat Dominus ut cultus talis {3} perciperetur 
in caelis, et sic per illum fieret conjunctio cum homine, non per interna {4} sed per correspondentias cum externis, de qua re videantur citata n. (x)9320 fin. et 9380; hic cultus est qui 
significatur per `ministerium Aharonis.' 	Quod etiam evangelizatio, est quia per evangelizationem 2  intelliguntur omnia quae in Verbo agunt de Domino, et omnia quae in cultu repraesentabant Ipsum; nam 
evangelizatio est annuntiatio de Domino, de Ipsius Adventu, et de illis quae ab Ipso, quae sunt salutis et vitae aeternae; et quia omnia Verbi in sensu ejus intimo agunt de solo Domino, et quoque omnia 
cultus repraesentabant Ipsum, ideo totum Verbum est evangelium, pariter omnis cultus qui secundum illa quae in Verbo mandata sunt factus est; et quia sacerdotes praeerant cultui, et quoque docebant, 
ideo per ministerium illorum cultus et evangelizatio significabatur. @1 cultus ex bono altered to boni$ @2 i non autem qui peragitur in externis absque illis, nam cultus ex illis auditur et percipitur 
in coelis,$ @3 i audiretur et$ @4 i eorum$ </p>
