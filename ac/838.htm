<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第838节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">（三）内义</h4><br /><strong>838.</strong>前两章论述的主题是被称为“挪亚”的新教会，或该教会成员：首先论述了他预备接受信，并通过信接受仁；接着论述了他的试探；之后论述了上古教会行将灭亡时对他的保护。本章的主题是其试探后的状态，它照着实现这种状态所在的次序被精确描述出来。这次序既适用于他，也适用于一切重生之人。因为主的圣言是这样：当论述一个人时，它也在论述所有人和每个个体，唯一的区别取决于各自的性情。这就是圣言的普世之义。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]838.</strong> Inner Meaning<br />THE last two chapters spoke of the new church called Noah, or of the people in that church. First it dealt with the preparation they underwent for receiving faith and for receiving charity through faith. Then it dealt with the trials they suffered, and later the way they were protected when the earliest church died out. What comes now is the state they were in following their trials, described in the order in which it developed.<br />This is also the order in which it develops in every person who is regenerating. The Lord's Word is such that where it talks about one person it talks about anyone and everyone, with differences according to each individual's character. This type of meaning is present everywhere in the Word. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 838</b></p><p><b>838.</b>
THE INTERNAL SENSE. In the two preceding chapters, the new church called "Noah" or the man of that church, was treated of: first, his preparation for receiving faith, and by faith, charity; next, his 
temptation; and afterwards, his protection, when the Most Ancient Church was perishing. What here follows is his state after temptation, which is described exactly in the order in which it was effected, 
both with him and with all who become regenerate; for the Word of the Lord is such that wherever it treats of one person, it treats of all men, and of every individual, with a difference according 
to the disposition of each: this being the universal sense of the Word. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 838</b></p><p><b>838.</b>
THE INTERNAL SENSE In the two previous chapters the subject was the new Church called Noah, that is, the individual constituting that Church. First of all they dealt with his preparation for receiving 
faith, and by way of faith charity. Then they dealt with his temptation, and after that with the way he was protected when the Most Ancient Church was dying out. In the present chapter the subject 
is his state following temptation and the actual order in which this was effected. At the same time the subject is the order in which this is effected in all who are to be regenerated. For the Word of 
the Lord is such that when it deals with one it is dealing with each and all, the only difference being according to the disposition of each one. This is the universal sense of the Word. </p>

</p><b>838.</b>
SENSUS INTERNUS </p>
<p>IN binis capitibus quae praecedunt, actum est de nova Ecclesia, Noahus dicta, seu de homine istius Ecclesiae; et quidem primum de illius praeparatione ad recipiendum fidem, et per 
fidem charitatem; deinde de ejus tentatione; postea de protectione, pereunte Ecclesia Antiquissima; hic nunc sequitur de statu ejus post tentationem, et quidem ordine quo se habuit; et simul ordine quo 
se habet apud regenerandos quoscumque; nam Verbum Domini tale est ut de omnibus et singulis, ubi de uno, agatur, cum differentia secundum cujusvis indolem; qui sensus est Verbi universalis. </p>
