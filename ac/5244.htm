<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5244节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5244.</strong>“于是，法老差人”表新属世层的倾向。这从“法老”的代表清楚可知，“法老”是指新的属世人，如前所述（<a href="5079.htm">5079</a>，<a href="5080.htm">5080</a>节）。“于是，法老差人去召约瑟”表示接受属灵层的属天层的倾向。这样的倾向从下面的经文（41:40-43）明显看出来，即：法老派他掌管他的家，治理埃及全地，并说他的民都必与约瑟亲嘴。这意味着，当状态完全或完整时，也就是说，当一切都在属世层中提供好，以接受从内层或高层而来的流注，将自己联结于所流入之物时，属世层就拥有那种倾向，也就是拥有接受的情感。当此人正被主变新时，这一个便以这种方式适应那一个。</p>

And Pharaoh sent. That this signifies the inclination of the new natural, is evident from the representation of Pharaoh, as being the new natural man (as in n. 5079, 5080). The inclination to receive 
the celestial of the spiritual is signified by his "sending and calling Joseph." The very inclination is plain from what is said farther on-that he set him over his house and over all the land of Egypt, 
and said that upon his mouth all his people should kiss (verses 40-43). In regard to this the case is that when the state is full, that is, when all things have been prepared in the natural for receiving 
influx from the interior or higher degree, and for applying to itself what flows in, then the natural has an inclination, that is, has an affection, for receiving. In this way the one is accommodated 
to the other when the man is being made new by the Lord. </p>

'And Pharaoh sent' means the inclination of the new natural. This is clear from the representation of 'Pharaoh' as the new natural man, dealt with in <a href="5079.htm">5079</a>, <a href="5080.htm">5080</a>. An inclination to accept the celestial 
of the spiritual is the meaning of the words 'sent and called Joseph'. Such an inclination is evident from what follows, in verses 40-43, where it is stated that Pharaoh set him over his house and over 
all the land of Egypt and said that all his people would kiss him on the mouth. The implications of this are that when the state is complete, that is, when everything has been made ready in the natural 
to accept an influx from what is interior or higher and to link itself to what flows into it, the natural too possesses that inclination, which is an affection disposed to accept [the celestial 
of the spiritual]. The one accordingly becomes compatible with the other when a person is being renewed by the Lord. </p>

`Et misit Pharaoh':  quod significet naturalis novi propensionem, constat ex repraesentatione `Pharaonis' quod sit naturalis homo novus, de qua n. 5079, 5080; propensio ad recipiendum caeleste spiritualis 
significatur per quod `miserit et vocaverit Josephum'; ipsa propensio patet a sequentibus, quod dederit eum super {1}domum suam et super omnem terram Aegypti, et dixerit quod super ore ejus oscularetur 
omnis populus ejus, vers. 40-43.  Cum his ita se habet:  cum status plenus est, hoc est, cum omnia parata sunt in naturali ad recipiendum influxum ab interiore seu superiore, et ad sibi applicandum 
illa quae influunt, tunc quoque naturale in propensione est, hoc est, in affectione recipiendi, ita accommodatur unum alteri cum homo renovatur a Domino. @1 A had domum suam, but altered to domo 
sua; see verse 40$ </p>
