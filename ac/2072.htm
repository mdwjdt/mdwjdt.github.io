<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2072节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2072.</strong>“窃笑”表对真理的情感。这从“笑”的起源和本质清楚可知。笑的起源无非是对真理的情感，或对虚假的情感，这种情感产生了通过笑声表现在脸上的欢笑和快乐。这表明笑的本质并非别的东西。事实上，笑是属于身体的外在事物，因为它属于面部表情。而在圣言中，内在事物通过外在事物来表达和表示。正如心智的一切内在情感以面部表情来表达和表示，内在听觉和顺从以耳朵来表示，内在视觉或理解力以眼睛来表示，能力和力量以手和臂来表示等等，对真理的情感同样以笑来表达和表示。<br />人类理性的主要元素是真理。这理性里面也有对良善的情感，不过，这情感存在于对真理的情感中，如同它的灵魂。存在于理性中的良善情感并不以笑声来表现自己，而是以某种欢喜和由此产生的不发笑的快乐感觉来表现自己，因为笑声通常包含某种并不那么良善的东西。真理是理性人中的主要元素，其原因在于，理性通过对真理的认知形成，因为谁也无法凭其它方法变得理性。对良善的认知是真理，就象对真理的认知是真理一样。<br />“窃笑”在此表对真理的情感。这从以下事实清楚可知，本节讲述了亚伯拉罕窃笑，就像撒拉在以撒出生前后窃笑一样，以撒因“笑”而得名，因为“以撒”这个词表示笑。从本节明显可知，亚伯拉罕听到以撒就发笑，因为经上说，亚伯拉罕听到撒拉所出的儿子后就窃笑。以下经文提到，在以撒出生前，撒拉从耶和华那里听说她要生一个儿子后也笑了：<br />当撒拉在帐棚门口听见这话时，撒拉心里窃笑，说，我已衰老，我的主也老了，怎能有这喜事呢？耶和华对亚伯拉罕说，撒拉为什么窃笑，说，我已年老，果真能生育吗？撒拉就害怕，不承认。祂说，不然，你实在笑了。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创18.12.htm">18:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创18.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创18.15.htm">15</a>）<br />后来，以撒出生后：<br />亚伯拉罕给撒拉所生的儿子起名叫以撒（笑声）。撒拉说，神使我喜笑，凡听见的必与我一同喜笑。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创21.3.htm">21:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创21.6.htm">6</a>）<br />若非“窃笑”和表示笑的“以撒”之名包含这类事物，这些事绝不会被提及。</p>

And laughed. That this signifies the affection of truth, may be seen from the origin and essence of laughter, for its origin is nothing but the affection of truth, or else the affection of what is false, 
from which come the gladness and merriment that in laughter display themselves in the face, which shows that the essence of laughter is nothing else. Laughter is indeed an external thing that belongs 
to the body because to the face; but in the Word interior things are expressed and signified by exterior things; just as all the interior affections of the mind are expressed and signified by means 
of the face, interior hearing and obedience being signified by the ear, interior sight or understanding by the eye, power and strength by the hand and arm, and so on, and in the same way the affection 
of truth by laughter.  [2] In man's rational there is truth, which is its chief characteristic, and there is also the affection of good, but this is in the very affection of truth as its soul. The 
affection of good which is in the rational does not display itself by means of laughter, but by means of a certain joy and consequent pleasurable delight which does not laugh; for in laughter there 
is usually something that is not so good. The reason why truth is the chief characteristic in man's rational, is that the rational is formed by means of the knowledges of truth, for by no other means 
can anyone ever become rational. The knowledges of good are truths, equally as much as are the knowledges of truth.  [3] That "laughter" here signifies the affection of truth, may be seen from its being 
related that Abraham laughed; and in like manner Sarah, both before Isaac was born, and afterwards; and also from Isaac's being named from "laughter," for the word "Isaac" means "laughter." That Abraham 
laughed when he heard about Isaac, is evident from this verse, for it is said that Abraham laughed when he heard about a son from Sarah. That Sarah also laughed before Isaac's birth, when she heard 
from Jehovah that she should bear a son, is told in the words, "When Sarah heard at the door of the tent, Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am grown old shall I have pleasure? and my 
lord old? And Jehovah said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, and I am become old? Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was, afraid. And He said, 
Nay, but thou didst laugh" (Gen. 18:12, 13, 15). And later, when Isaac had been born, "Abraham called the name of his son Isaac" (meaning "laughter"); and Sarah said, "God hath made laughter for me; 
everyone that heareth shall laugh with me" (Gen. 21:3, 6). Unless "laughing" and the name "Isaac," meaning "laughter," involved such things, these matters would never have been related. </p>

'And laughed' means the affection for truth. This becomes clear from the origin and essential nature of laughter. In origin it is nothing other than the affection for truth or the affection for falsity, 
which produces the mirth and pleasure exhibited in the face by means of laughter. This shows that the essential nature of laughter is nothing else. Actually laughter is something external belonging 
to the body since it belongs to the face; but in the Word interior things are expressed and are-meant by exterior. Just as all interior affections of both areas of mind (animus et mens) are expressed 
and meant by the face; interior hearing and obedience by the ear; internal sight, which is understanding, by the eye; power and strength by the hand and arm; and so on; so is the affection for truth 
expressed and meant by laughter. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The principal element in man's rational is truth. Also present in the rational there is the affection for good, but this affection is present within the affection 
for truth, as the soul within it. The affection for good present within the rational does not express itself in laughter but in a type of joy and a resulting sense of delight which does not laugh. 
For laughter generally entails something that is not so good. The reason truth is the principal element in the rational man is that the rational is formed by means of cognitions of truth, for there is 
no other possible way in which anyone can become rational. Cognitions of good are truths just as much as cognitions of truth are truths. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That 'laughter' here means the affection for truth becomes 
clear from the fact that this verse records Abraham's having laughed, as did Sarah both before Isaac was born and after, and also from the fact that he was given the name Isaac from 'laughter', for 
the word 'Isaac' means laughter. The fact that Abraham laughed when he heard about Isaac is clear from the present verse, for it is actually stated that when he heard about a son by Sarah he laughed. 
Sarah's laughing as well before the birth of Isaac when she heard from Jehovah that she was going to give birth is referred to as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
When Sarah heard at the tent door Sarah laughed within 
herself, saying, After I have grown old, shall I have the pleasure, and my lord being an old man? And Jehovah said to Abraham, Why did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I in truth bear now I have grown old? 
Sarah denied it, saying, I did not laugh; for she was afraid. And He said, No, but you did laugh. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2018:12,%2013,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 18:12, 13, 15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Also later on after Isaac's birth, </p>
<blockquote>
Abraham called the name of his son Isaac 
(laughter). Sarah said, God has made laughter for me; everyone hearing of it will laugh at me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2021:3,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 21:3, 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Unless 'laughing' and the name Isaac, which means laughter, embodied such things these occurrences 
would never have been mentioned. </p>

`Et risit': quod significet affectionem veri, constare potest ex origine et essentia risus; origo ejus non alia est quam affectio veri vel affectio falsi, inde hilaritas et laetitia quae exserit se 
in facie per risum; inde patet quod essentia risus non aliud sit; risus quidem est externum quid quod corporis quia faciei, sed in Verbo interiora per exteriora {1} exprimuntur et significantur, sicut 
omnes affectiones interiores animi et mentis per faciem, auditio interior et oboedientia per aurem, visus internus seu intellectus per oculum, potentia et robur per manum et brachium, et sic porro, ita 
affectio veri per risum: [2] in rationali hominis est verum, quod est praecipuum, in illo etiam est affectio boni, sed haec est in ipsa affectione veri, sicut ejus anima; affectio boni quae in rationali, 
non se exserit per risum sed per gaudium quoddam, et inde per jucundum voluptatis quod non (x)ridet; nam in risu communiter quoque aliquid est quod non ita bonum.  Quod in rationali hominis verum 
sit praecipuum, causa est quia rationale formatur per cognitiones veri, nam nisi per illas, nusquam aliquis rationalis fieri potest; cognitiones boni sunt aeque vera ac cognitiones veri.  [3] Quod 
`risus' hic significet affectionem veri, constare potest ex eo quod hic memoretur Abraham risisse, et similiter {2} Sarah, tam antequam natus Isacus quam postquam natus, tum quod Isacus a `risu' nominatus, 
nam `Isac' significat `risum'; quod Abraham, cum audivit {3} de Isaco, riserit, ex hoc versu constat, nam dicitur quod Abraham, cum audivit {4} de filio ex Sarah, riserit; quod etiam Sarah, antequam 
natus Isacus, cum audivit a Jehovah quod pareret, de qua ita, 	Sarah cum audivit ad ostium tentorii, risit Sarah intra seipsam, dicendo, Postquam consenui, eritne mihi voluptas, et dominus meus 
senex? et dixit Jehovah ad Abrahamum, Quare hoc risit Sarah, dicendo, Num etiam vere {5} pariam, et ego consenui?... Negavit Sarah, dicendo, Non risi, quia timuit; et dixit, Non, at risisti, Gen. xviii 
12, 13, 15; </p>
<p>dein etiam cum Isacus natus esset, 	Vocavit Abrahamus nomen filii sui,... {6} Jishak (risum)... dixit Sarah, Risum fecit mihi Deus, omnis audiens ridebit me {7}, Gen. xxi 3, 6; </p>
<p>nisi `ridere' 
et `nomen Isaci' quo significatur risus, illa involveret, nusquam haec memorata fuissent. 	@1 externa.$ 	@2 i quod.$ 	@3 audiverit I.$ 	@4 audiverit A.$ 	@5 vero.$ 	@6 i qui natus est sibi,
