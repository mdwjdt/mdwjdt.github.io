<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2411节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2411.</strong>“二人就拉着他的手和他妻子的手，并他两个女儿的手”表主强有力地拦阻他们，使他们远离邪恶，从而在“罗得”、“他的妻子”和“他女儿”所表示的善与真中得以强化。这从“二人”、“手”、“罗得”、“妻子”和“女儿”的含义清楚可知：“二人”是指主，如前所述；“手”是指力量（参看<a href="878.htm">878</a>）；“罗得”是指仁之善（参看<a href="2324.htm">2324</a>，<a href="2351.htm">2351</a>，<a href="2371.htm">2371</a>，<a href="2399.htm">2399</a>节）；“妻子”是指信之真（如<a href="http://39-27.cn/创19.26.htm">19:26</a>所述）；“女儿”是指对善与真的情感（参看<a href="489.htm">489</a>-<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="2362.htm">2362</a>节）；最后从前面所述（<a href="2388.htm">2388</a>节）清楚可知，也就是说，随着人远离邪恶，善与真便从主流入；随之“罗得，他的妻子和他两个女儿”所表示的善与真也在同等程度上得以强化。<br />人若反思，便能通过自己的亲身经历得知这一点。他越远离肉体和世俗之物，其观念就越属灵，即他越被提升向天堂，这就是人处于神圣敬拜、经历试探，以及不幸或病患时的情形。众所周知，那时，肉体和世俗之物，即对它们的欲望或爱被除去。原因如前所述，即属天、属灵之物不断从主流入；而从肉体和世俗之物所流入的邪恶及其衍生的虚假，和虚假及其衍生的邪恶则阻碍对属天、属灵之物的接受。</p>

And the men laid hold of his hand, and of the hand of his wife, and of the hand of his two daughters. That this signifies that the Lord powerfully withheld from evils, and thus strengthened the goods 
and truths signified by "Lot, his wife, and his daughters," is evident from the signification of the "men," as being the Lord (concerning which above); from the signification of the "hand," as being 
power (see n. 878); also from the signification of "Lot," as being the good of charity (see n. 2324, 2351, 2371, 2399); from the signification of "wife," as being the truth of faith (treated of in the 
26th verse); from the signification of "daughters," as being the affections of good and of truth (see n. 489-491, 2362); and finally from what was said above (n. 2388), namely, that good and truth flow 
in from the Lord in the proportion that man is withheld from evil; consequently, that the goods and truths signified by "Lot, his wife, and His two daughters," are in the same proportion strengthened. [2] 
On reflection every man may know this from his own experience; for in proportion as he is removed from corporeal and worldly things, in the same proportion he is in a spiritual idea, that is, 
is uplifted toward heaven; as is the case when he is in any holy worship, when in any temptation, also when in misfortune or sickness. It is well known that corporeal and worldly things, that is, the 
loves of them, are then removed, the reason being as stated, namely, that what is heavenly and spiritual from the Lord continually flows in; but evil and its derivative falsity, and falsity and its derivative 
evil, which flow in from corporeal and worldly things, are what hinder its being received. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2411</b></p><p><b>2411.</b>
'The men grasped his hand, and his wife's hand, and his daughters' hands' means that the Lord withheld him powerfully from evils and in so doing strengthened goods and truths meant by 'Lot, his wife, 
and his daughters'. This is clear from the meaning of 'the men' as the Lord, dealt with above; from the meaning of 'hand' as power, dealt with in <a href="878.htm">878</a>; also from the meaning of 'Lot' as good that flows 
from charity, dealt with in <a href="2324.htm">2324</a>, <a href="2351.htm">2351</a>, <a href="2371.htm">2371</a>, <a href="2399.htm">2399</a>; from the meaning of 'wife' as the truth of faith, dealt with in verse 26 below; and from the meaning of 'daughters' as affections for truth and for 
good, dealt with in <a href="489.htm">489</a>-<a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="2362.htm">2362</a>. Last of all it is clear from what has been stated in <a href="2388.htm">2388</a>, that is to say, that good and truth flow in from the Lord in the measure that a person is withheld from 
evil. Consequently the goods and truths meant by 'Lot, his wife, and his two daughters' are in that measure strengthened. </p>

 This anyone may know from personal experience, if he stops to reflect. 
To the extent he is removed from bodily and worldly interests his ideas are spiritual, that is, he is lifted up towards heaven, as happens when engaged in any kind of sacred worship, when undergoing any 
temptation, and also when experiencing misfortune or sickness. At such times bodily and worldly interests - that is, the loves of them - are, as is well known, removed. The reason, which has been stated, 
is that what is celestial and spiritual is flowing in constantly from the Lord, but evil together with derivative falsity exists, and falsity together with derivative evil, which flow in from the 
bodily and worldly interests and obstruct the reception of what is celestial and spiritual. </p>

Quod `apprehenderunt viri manum ejus, et manum uxoris ejus, et manum duarum filiarum ejus' significet quod Dominus potenter detinuerit a malis, et sic corroboraverit bona et vera significat per `Lotum, 
uxorem ejus, et filias ejus,' constat (c)a significatione `virorum' quod sit Dominus, de qua supra; ex significatione `manu quod sit potentia, de qua n. 878; tum a significatione `Loti' quod sit bonum 
charitatis, de qua n. 2324, 2351, 2371, 2399; ex significatione `uxoris' quod sit verum fidei, de qua in sequente vers. 26; et a significatione `filiarum' quod sint affectiones veri et boni, de qua 
n. 489-49 2362; tum denique (c)ab illis quae dicta sunt n. 2388, nempe quod tantum influat bonum et verum a Domino, quantum detinetur homo a malo, proinde quod tantum corroborentur bona et vera significata 
per `Lotum, uxorem ejus, et duas filias ejus'; [2] hoc quoque quisque ex propria experientia, si reflectit, scire potest; quantum enim removetur a corporeis et mundanis, tantum in idea spirituali 
est, hoc est, elevatur versus caelum, ut fit, quando est {1} in aliquo cultu sancto quando in aliqua tentatione, tum quando in infortuniis aut in morbis; quod tunc remota sint corporea et mundana, 
hoc est, amores eorum, notum est; causa est, quae dicta, quod caeleste et spirituale a Domino continue influat, sed est malum et inde falsum, et est falsum et in malum, quae a corporeis et mundanis 
influunt, quae obstant quin recipiatur. 	@1 est after sancto.$ </p>
