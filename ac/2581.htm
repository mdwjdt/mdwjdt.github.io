<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2581节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2581.</strong>“神就医好亚比米勒”表教义在良善方面的健全。这从“医好”的含义和“亚比米勒”的代表性清楚可知：“医好”是指变得健全；“亚比米勒”是指关注理性事物的信之教义（<a href="2510.htm">2510</a>节）。从以下事实明显可知，这是指教义在良善方面的健全：经上还说医好了他的妻子，这表示教义在真理方面的健全。因为在圣言中，当丈夫被视为“丈夫”，还以名字来称呼时，他表示良善，他的妻子表示真理；但当丈夫被视为“男人”时，他表示真理，他的妻子则表示良善（参看<a href="915.htm">915</a>，<a href="1468.htm">1468</a>，<a href="2517.htm">2517</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2581</b></p><p><b>2581.</b>
And God healed Abimelech. That this signifies the soundness of the doctrine in respect to good, is evident from the signification of "healing," as being to make sound; and from the representation of 
Abimelech, as being the doctrine of faith looking to rational things (n. 2510). That it is in respect to good is evident from the fact that his wife also is said to be healed, by which is meant the soundness 
of the doctrine in respect to truth; for when in the Word a husband is called "husband," and also when he is called by name, he then signifies good, and his wife truth; but when a husband is called 
a "man," he then signifies truth, and his wife good (see also n. 915, 1468, 2517). </p>

'And God healed Abimelech' means wholeness of doctrine as regards good. This is clear from the meaning of 'healing' as making whole, and from the representation of 'Abimelech' as the doctrine of faith 
which has regard to rational things, <a href="2510.htm">2510</a>. That it is a wholeness as regards good is evident from the fact that his wife as well is said to have been healed, by which is meant wholeness of doctrine 
as regards truth. For when in the Word the husband is called 'husband', and also when he is referred to by name, he means good and his 'wife' truth; but when the husband is called 'men' he means truth 
and his 'wife' good. See also in <a href="915.htm">915</a>, <a href="1468.htm">1468</a>, <a href="2517.htm">2517</a>. </p>

</p><b>2581.</b>
`Et sanavit Deus Abimelechum': quod significet doctrinae integritatem quoad bonum, constat a significatione `sanare' quod sit integrum facere; et a repraesentatione `Abimelechi' quod sit doctrina fidei 
spectans rationalia, {1} n. 2510: quod sit quoad bonum, patet ex eo quod etiam uxor ejus dicatur sanata, per quod significatur doctrinae integritas quoad verum; cum enim in Verbo maritus vocatur `maritus,' 
ut et cum nominatur, tunc ille significat bonum et `uxor' verum; cum vero maritus dicitur `vir,' tunc is significat verum et `uxor' bonum, de quo etiam n. 915, 1468, 2517. 	@1 de qua.$ </p>
