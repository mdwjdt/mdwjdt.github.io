<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">关于火星的灵人和居民（续）</h4><br />7475.火星灵把自己看为诸如在世上的那种人。这也是别人看他们的方式；事实上，在来世，每个人如何向自己显现，就如何向别人显现，因为他所觉知到的东西被交流给他人。当我对此感到惊讶时，他们说，他们无法以其它任何方式显现，因为他们活在世上时就知道，他们是披着肉体的灵；那时，他们很少思想肉体，只思想其在肉体里面的灵的生命。因此，当进入来世时，他们几乎不知道其生命的状态已经发生改变；这时他们也思想其灵的生命，和在世上一样，故看自己和那时一样。诚然，所有灵人都被包裹在人形中，但都没有被包裹在像火星灵所处的人形那样显着的一个人形中；因为水星灵仍持守他们在世时所持有的那种观念。此外，对那些在世时就知道并相信，在来世，自己必住在一个人形里面的人来说，随着肉身丧失力量，这种思维会逐渐增强。因此，当脱去在世上为了功用而服务于他们的肉身时，由于这种观念已经铭刻在他们身上，他们仍保持原样，和在世时一样。</p>

CONTINUATION ABOUT THE SPIRITS AND INHABITANTS OF THE PLANET MARS. The spirits of the planet Mars appear to themselves as men such as they had been in the world, and therefore they have to others a 
like appearance; for everyone in the other life appears to others as he appears to himself, because the perception is communicated. When I wondered at this, they said that they cannot appear otherwise, 
because when they lived in the world they knew that they were spirits clothed with a body, and then thought little about their body, but only about the life of their spirit in the body; and therefore 
when they come into the other life they scarcely know that the state of life has been changed; and as they then also think about the life of their spirit just as they did in the world, they therefore 
appear to themselves like men. All spirits are indeed in the human form, but not in one so strikingly like that in which are the spirits of Mars; for with these the idea remains such as they had in 
the world. Moreover, with those who when in the world know and believe that in the other life they shall be in the human form, as the body decreases, this thought increases; and therefore when they put 
off the body which had served them for use in the world, from the idea impressed upon them they remain to themselves in a like form. </p>

SPIRITS AND INHABITANTS OF THE PLANET MARS - continued </p>
<p>When spirits belonging to Mars look at themselves they see themselves as the kind of people they were in the world. That is also how others see 
them, for in the next life everyone is seen by others as he sees himself, because what he perceives is communicated to others. When I was astounded by this they said that they could not be seen in 
any other way, because when they had lived in the world they had known that they were spirits clothed with the body and because at that time they had given little thought to their body, concentrating 
instead on the life of their spirit within the body. Consequently when they enter the next life they are hardly aware that their state of life has altered, and since at this time also their thought is 
about the life of the spirit, as it had been in the world, they see themselves as they had seen themselves then. All spirits, it is true, are enveloped in a human form, yet not in one so well-defined 
as those of Martian spirits since the latter retain the kind of ideas they had in the world. Furthermore in the case of people who know and believe, when they are in the world, that in the next life 
they will live within a human form, that thought grows all the stronger as the body loses its strength. Therefore when they cast aside the body which has been their servant for a useful life in the world 
they remain the same, as a result of that idea imprinted on them, as they were in the world. </p>

Continuatio de Spiritibus et Incolis Planetae Martis </p>
<p>Spiritus Martis apparent sibi sicut homines quales fuerant in mundo; quapropter etiam similiter (t)aliis apparent, nam quisque in altera vita 
aliis apparet sicut ipse sibi, quia communicatur perceptio.  Hoc cum miratus sum, dicebant quod aliter non apparere possint, quia cum vixerunt in mundo, sciverunt quod essent spiritus corpore amicti, 
et quia tunc de corpore suo parum cogitaverunt, modo de vita spiritus sui in corpore; inde cum in alteram vitam veniunt, paene nesciunt quod status vitae mutatus sit, et quoniam tunc quoque cogitant de 
vita sui spiritus similiter ac in mundo, ideo sibi similes tunc {1}apparent.  Sunt quidem omnes spiritus in forma humana, sed non in tam exstanti, in quali sunt spiritus Martis; nam apud hos manet idea 
qualem habuerunt in mundo {2}.  Praeterea etiam, qui cum in mundo sunt, sciunt, ac in fide sunt, quod in altera vita erunt in (t)forma humana, illi prout decrescit corpus {3}, ita accrescit cogitatio 
illa, quapropter cum exuunt corpus, quod illis pro usu serviverat in mundo, ex impressa idea manent sibi similes. 	@1 appareant$ 	@2 i; haec idea facit quod prae aliis spiritibus sicut homines in 
mundo appareant$ 	@3 i in mundo$ </p>
