<p><strong>[NCE]869.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_869/bible_king-james-version_genesis_8_8" target=_top>Genesis 8:8</a>. And he sent a dove out from him, to see whether the water had lessened off the face of the ground.<br />The dove{*1} symbolizes the truth and goodness of faith in one who is being reborn. He sent a dove out from him to see symbolizes the right conditions for taking in faith's truth and goodness. Whether the water had lessened symbolizes falsities that get in the way. The face of the ground is things that people in the church have in them. The word ground is used because this is the first stage a person goes through in becoming a church.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} "Because of its mild and peaceful habits, its attachment to its mate, even its color and its song, the dove, from the beginning of ancient humanity's use of symbols, has been taken as the ideogram of peace, purity, simplicity, patience in suffering, and conjugal fidelity" (Charbonneau-Lassay 1991, 229 and following). As a symbol of peace, it is linked to the olive branch that it carries in the story of the Flood. In the New Testament, it is a symbol of the Holy Spirit: see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_869/bible_king-james-version_matthew_3_16" target=_top>Matthew 3:16</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_869/bible_king-james-version_mark_1_10" target=_top>Mark 1:10</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_869/bible_king-james-version_luke_3_22" target=_top>Luke 3:22</a>; and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_869/bible_king-james-version_john_1_32-34" target=_top>John 1:32-34</a>.

Verse 8. And he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the faces of the ground. By "a dove" are signified the truths and goods of faith with him who is to be regenerated; 
"and he sent forth a dove from him to see" signifies the state of receiving the truths and goods of faith; "if the waters were abated" signifies falsities which impede; "the faces of the ground" signifies 
the things which are in the man of the church; it is said "ground" because this is the first state when man becomes a church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 869</b></p><p><b>869.</b>
Verse 8 And he sent out a dove from himself to see whether the waters had abated from over the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the ground.  </p>
<p>'A dove' means the truths and goods of faith residing with a person who is to be 
regenerated. 'He sent out a dove from himself to see' means a state of receiving the truths and goods of faith. 'Whether the waters had abated' means falsities that hinder. 'The face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the ground' 
is those things that reside with the member of the Church. The expression 'the ground' is used because it is the first stage at which man comes to be the Church.

Vers. 8.  Et emisit columbam a secum ad videndum, num diminutae sint aquae de super faciebus humi. Per 'columbam' significantur vera et bona fidei apud regenerandum: 'quod emiserit columbam a secum 
ad videndum' significant statum recipiendi vera et bona fidei: 'num diminutae sint aquae' significant falsitates quae impediunt: 'facies humi' sunt illa quae apud hominem Ecclesiae; 'humus' dicitur quia 
primus status, cum homo fit Ecclesia. </p>
