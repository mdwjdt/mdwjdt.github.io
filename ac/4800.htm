<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4800节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4800.</strong>很少有人能相信灵人和天使社群的存在，并且人里面的一切事物都对应于这些社群；而且社群越多，社群里的成员越多，这种对应关系就越好、越强；因为众人一心才能有真正的力量。为叫我知道事实的确如此，我被指示他们如何作用于脸，并进入它，又如何进入前额肌肉、脸颊肌肉，以及下巴和喉咙的肌肉。那些属于脸部区域的人被允许流入我的脸，然后每一个细节都照着他们的流注而变化。其中一些人还与我交谈。不过，他们不知道他们被分到脸这个区域，因为他们所分到的这个区域向灵人隐藏了，但未向天使隐藏。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4800</b></p><p><b>4800.</b>
Very few can believe that there are societies of spirits and of angels to which all the things in man correspond; also that the more societies there are, and the more in a society, the better and stronger 
is the correspondence; for in unanimous numbers there is strength. In order that I might know that this is so, it was shown how they act and flow into the face, how into the muscles of the forehead, 
into those of the cheeks, and into those of the chin and throat. Those who belonged to this province were permitted to flow in, and then every particular was varied according to their influx. Some 
of them also conversed with me, but they did not know that they were assigned to the province of the face; for to what province they are assigned is unknown to spirits, but not to angels. </p>

Very few people are able to believe that communities of spirits and angels exist with which every individual part of the human being has a correspondence, and also that the more communities there are, 
and the more members within any community, the better and stronger is the correspondence For a multitude having one mind possesses real strength. To enable me to know that this is so, I was shown how 
they act on and enter into the face, how they do so into the muscles of the forehead, into those of the cheeks, and also into those of the chin and the throat. Those belonging to the province of the 
face were allowed to enter my face, where in response to their entry variations were produced in every individual part. Some of them also spoke to me. But they did not know that they were assigned to 
the province of the face, for this province to which they have been assigned is hidden from spirits, but not from angels. </p>

</p><b>4800.</b>
Paucissimi credere possunt quo spirituum et angelorum societates sint quibus correspondent singula apud hominem, tum quo plures societates sunt, ac quo plures in societate, quod eo melior et fortior 
correspondentia in multitudine enim unanima est fortitudo; ut scirem quod ita sit, ostensum est quomodo agunt et influunt in faciem, quomodo in musculos frontis, inque genarum, tum menti et juguli 
{1}; dabatur illis qui ad illam provinciam pertinebant, influere, et tunc secundum illorum influxum singula variabantur; quidam eorum etiam mecum loquebantur; sed illi non sciebant quod dicati 
essent provinciae faciei, nam cui provinciae dicati sunt, latet spiritus, non autem angelos.      @1 cervicis$ </p>
