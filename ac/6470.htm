<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6470节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6470.</strong>一切生命皆来自主，我从以事实得知这一真理：没有哪个灵人从他自己思考和说话，而是从其他灵人如此行，这些其他灵人又是从别的灵人思考和说话，依此类推。这一真理经常被证明给那些以为生命在他们里面，而非流入的人；他们通过这种证明得出这样的结论：没有哪个人的思维和言语是始于他自己，而是来自其他人，每个人的思维和言语最终都来自一个源头，因而来自主。除非每个人的思维和言语都来自一个源头，否则将秩序引入天堂里的人之生命中是根本不可能的。然而，这种秩序却存在于那里，包括照着良善的品质明确地划分社群。如果每个人都出于他自己的生命行动，这种情况就完全不同了。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6470</b></p><p><b>6470.</b>
That all life is from the Lord, it has also been given to know from the fact that no spirit thinks and speaks from himself, but from others, and these others from yet others, and so on. This has been 
frequently shown to those who believed that life was in them and did not flow in; and from this it has been given to conclude that because no one thinks and speaks from himself, but from others, therefore 
in the last resort all think and speak from One, thus from the Lord; and that unless all did so from One, it would be impossible for any order of lives to come forth in heaven, in which nevertheless 
the order is such that heaven is most distinctly arranged into societies according to the quality of the good. It would be altogether otherwise if everyone acted from his own life. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6470</b></p><p><b>6470.</b>
The truth that all life comes from the Lord I have also been allowed to know from the consideration that no spirit's thought or speech originates in himself but comes from others, and that these others 
derive theirs from others again, and so on. This truth has often been demonstrated to those who believed that life was intrinsic, not something which flowed in. From this demonstration of it they were 
led to conclude that since nobody's thought or speech begins in himself but comes from others, everyone's comes ultimately from a single source, thus from the Lord. And unless everyone's had come 
from a single source it would have been quite impossible to introduce order into the lives of those in heaven. Such order does however exist there, involving clear-cut divisions into communities on the 
basis of their good. The situation would be altogether different if everyone's actions sprang from life that was his own. </p>

</p><b>6470.</b>
Quod omnis vita a Domino, etiam {1}ex eo scire datum est quod non aliquis spiritus cogitet et loquatur ex se sed ab aliis, et quod hi alii ab aliis, et sic porro; hoc saepius ostensum est illis qui 
credebant quod vita inesset et non influeret; et exinde concludere datum est quod, quia nullus a se sed ab aliis cogitat et loquitur, tandem omnes ab uno, ita a Domino; et nisi omnes ab uno, quod nusquam 
potuisset aliquis ordo vitarum existere in caelo, in quo tamen ille ordo est, ut distinctissimum sit in societates secundum quale boni; aliter prorsus foret si quisque ageret ex sua vita. @1 inde$ </p>
