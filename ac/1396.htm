<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1396节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1396.</strong>有一个灵人在世时渴望因自己所做所教导的而邀功，他向右走去，来到一些人跟前，但这些人却不是这种人。为了能成为他们社群中的一员，这个灵人说，他什么也不是，他愿意服侍他们。但就在他开始靠近的那一瞬间，事实上，在他离得还很远的时候，他们就察觉出他的本性，于是立刻回复说，他不是他所自称的那种人，而是渴望成为大人物，因而无法与那些小人物和谐共处。他闻言很是羞愧，就退走了，并惊讶于他们在那么远的地方就能知道他。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1396.</strong> A certain spirit who wanted to take credit for the deeds he had done and the doctrines he had taught while living in the world went off toward the right and came upon some people who were not like him. In order to attach himself to them, he said that he was a nobody and would like to serve them, but they had been sensing what he was like from the moment he approached them, while he was still far away. Their immediate answer was that he was not the kind of person he said; he wanted to be important and consequently would not be able to get along with them, since they were not. Embarrassed by this, he left, amazed that they could tell from such a distance. </p>

A certain spirit who while he lived in the world had desired to arrogate to himself merit for his acts and his teaching, went away to the right and came to those who were not of such a character. In 
order that he might be associated with them, he said that he was nothing, and that he desired to serve them; but instantly, on his first approach, and indeed while he was still far away, they perceived 
what he was; and they at once replied that he was not what he professed to be, but that he desired to be great, and therefore could not be in agreement with them, who were little. Being ashamed at this, 
he withdrew, wondering that they knew him so far away. </p>

A certain spirit who wished to lay claim to merit for what he had done and taught while living in the world went away towards the right and came to some who were not such that he could be made one of 
their community He said that he was nothing and that he wished to serve them. But they began to perceive what he was really like as soon as he started to approach them, and indeed when he was still a 
long way off. They replied instantly that he was nothing of the kind, but that he wished to be great, and that this being so he could not live in harmony with those who were lowly. At this he was put 
to shame and withdrew, amazed that they should know him from such a distance. </p>

</p><b>1396.</b>
Quidam spiritus qui sibi arrogare voluit meritum ex suis actis et sua doctrina dum vixit in mundo, dextrorsum abiit, et venit ad illos qui non tales ut illis associaretur; dixit quod nihil sit quodque 
illis servire vellet; sed illi statim ad primum adventum, et quidem e longinquo, appercipiebant qualis esset, respondebant ilico quod non talis, sed quod magnus esse vellet, et quod sic non concordare 
posset cum illis qui parvi sunt; inde pudefactus recessit, miratus quod tam e longinquo scirent. </p>
