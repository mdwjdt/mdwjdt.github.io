<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2421节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2421.</strong>创世记19:18，19.罗得对他们说，我主啊，不要如此！看哪，你仆人既然在你眼前蒙恩，你又向我大施怜悯，使我的灵魂存活。我不能逃到山上去，恐怕这灾祸临到我，我便死了。<br />“罗得对他们说，我主啊，不要如此”表软弱，因为他做不到。“看哪，你仆人既然在你眼前蒙恩”表由对真理的情感所产生的谦卑；“你又向我大施怜悯”表由对良善的情感所产生的谦卑的表象。“使我的灵魂存活”表由于主渴望拯救他。“我不能逃到山上去”表怀疑他是否能拥有仁之善。“恐怕这灾祸临到我，我便死了”表这将不可避免地导致他同时处于邪恶，从而被定罪。</p>

Verses 18, 19. And Lot said unto them, Nay I pray my lords. Behold I pray thy servant hath found grace in thine eyes, and thou hast made thy mercy great which thou hast done with me to make alive my 
soul; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest peradventure evil cleave to me, and I die. "Lot said unto them, Nay I pray my lords," signifies weakness, so that he could not; "Behold I pray thy servant 
hath found grace in thine eyes," signifies humiliation from the affection of truth; "thou hast made thy mercy great," signifies a semblance of humiliation from the affection of good; "which thou hast 
done with me to make alive my soul," signifies on account of His desiring to save him; "and I cannot escape to the mountain," signifies doubt as to his being able to have the good of charity; "lest 
peradventure evil cleave to me, and I die," signifies that then it could not but come to pass that he would be at the same time in evil, and thereby would be condemned. </p>

Verses 18, 19 And Lot said to them, Not so, my Lords. Behold now, your servant has found grace in your eyes, and you have magnified your mercy which you have shown to me in causing my soul to live. But 
I shall not be able to escape into the mountain in case the evil clings to me and I die. </p>
<p>'Lot said to them, Not so, my Lords' means weakness in that he could not do so. 'Behold now, your servant 
has found grace in your eyes' means a state of humility resulting from the affection for truth. 'You have magnified your mercy' means a likeness of a state of humility resulting from the affection for 
good. 'Which you have shown to me in causing my soul to live' means because of His desire to save him. 'But I shall not be able to escape into the mountain' means doubt as to whether he would be able 
to possess good that flows from charity. 'In case the evil clings to me and I die' means it would inevitably result in evil existing with him at the same time and that this being so he would be condemned. </p>

Vers. 18, 19.  Et dixit Lot ad eos, Ne quaeso Domini mei Ecce quaeso invenit servus tuus gratiam in oculis tuis, et magnam fecisti misericordiam tuam, quam fecisti mecum ad vivificandum animam meam; 
et ego non potero eripere me in montem, ne forte adhaereat mihi malum, et moriar. `Dixit Lot ad eos, Ne quaeso Domini mei' significat imbecillitatem quod non posset: `ecce quaeso invenit servus tuus 
gratiam in oculis tuis' significat humiliationem ex affectione veri `magnam fecisti misericordiam tuam' significat humiliationis instar ex affectione boni: `quam fecisti mecum ad vivificandum animam meam' 
significat pro eo quod vellet salvare eum: `et ego non potest eripere me in montem' significat dubitationem quod non posse habere bonum charitatis: `ne forte adhaereat mihi malum, et moriar' significat 
tunc non aliter fieri posset quam quod simul ex {1} malo, et si damnaretur. 	@1 2426 has in.$ </p>
