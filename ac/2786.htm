<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2786节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2786.</strong>“往神所指示他的地方去了”表那时依照直觉的状态。这从“地方”和“神指示他”的含义清楚可知：“地方”是指状态（参看<a href="1273.htm">1273</a>-<a href="1277.htm">1277</a>，<a href="1376.htm">1376</a>-<a href="1381.htm">1381</a>，<a href="2625.htm">2625</a>节）；“神指示他”是指通过神性发觉（<a href="2769.htm">2769</a>，<a href="2778.htm">2778</a>节）。至于这种状态本身，它在本节有所描述，是主经历试探时所具有的状态，在此是指祂经历最严厉、最内在的试探之时的状态。主为这种状态所作的第一个准备就是进入平安纯真的状态，并在自己里面预备其属世人和理性人，以便它们可以服务于神圣理性。祂将公义的功德与神圣的理性联结起来，以这种方式提升祂自己。<br />人若不知道很多状态同时共存，却又彼此分离、截然不同，也不知道何为平安纯真的状态，何为属世人和理性人，以及何为公义的功德，那么这些事根本不可能解释清楚，或呈现在他的脑海中。他必须先对这些问题有一个清晰的概念，也必须知道，主通过其神性能随心所欲地将自己带入任何状态，并通过制造出许多状态而预备自己进入试探。对世人来说，这些事笼罩在如夜晚的模糊中，但对天使而言，却沐浴在如白昼的光明中。因为天使居于从主所流出的天堂之光中，能看到这些及类似无数事物，每一个都看得很清晰，还能出于当时所流入的情感而体验到无法形容的喜悦。由此清楚可知，人类的理解和领悟力距离天使的何等遥远。</p>

And went unto the place of which God told him. That this signifies His state at that time according to perception, is evident from the signification of "place," as being state (see n. 1273-1277, 1376-1381, 
2625); and from the signification of "God saying," as being to perceive from the Divine (n. 2769, 2778). As regards the state itself, it is described in this verse, that is, the state which the 
Lord assumed when He underwent temptations, and here that which He assumed when He underwent the most grievous and inmost temptations. His first preparation for that state was that He entered into a 
state of peace and innocence, and that He prepared the natural man in Himself, as also the rational, so that they should serve the Divine rational, and that He adjoined the merit of righteousness, and 
in this manner elevated Himself. These things cannot be explained at all to the comprehension, or be presented to the idea, of anyone who does not know that many states exist together, and these distinct 
from one another; and who does not also know what a state of peace and innocence is, what the natural man is, what the rational man, and also what the merit of righteousness is; for he must first 
have a distinct idea of all these, and must also know that the Lord from His Divine could induce upon Himself whatever states He pleased, and that He prepared Himself for temptations by inducing many 
states. Although these things are in obscurity as of night with men, they are nevertheless in clearness as of day with the angels, who being in the light of heaven from the Lord, see in these and similar 
things innumerable things distinctly, and from the affection flowing in at the time perceive ineffable joy. Hence it is evident how far human understanding and perception fall short of angelic understanding 
and perception. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2786</b></p><p><b>2786.</b>
'And went to the place of which God had told him' means the state at that time according to perception. This is clear from the meaning of 'place' as state, dealt with in <a href="1273.htm">1273</a>-<a href="1277.htm">1277</a>, <a href="1376.htm">1376</a>-<a href="1381.htm">1381</a>, <a href="2625.htm">2625</a>, and 
from the meaning of 'God's telling him' as perceiving from the Divine, dealt with in <a href="2769.htm">2769</a>, <a href="2778.htm">2778</a>. As regards the state itself, this is described in the present verse - the state which the Lord assumed 
when undergoing temptations, here that state when He underwent the severest and inmost temptations. The preliminary preparation for that state consisted in His entering a state of peace and innocence, 
and also in the preparation by Him of His natural man, and of His rational man too, so that these might serve the Divine Rational, to which He joined the merit of righteousness, and by doing these 
things raising Himself up.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 These matters cannot possibly be explained intelligibly or presented to the thought of anyone who does not know that many states exist together simultaneously, yet 
distinct and separate from one another, and who also does not know what a state of peace and innocence is, what the natural man is, and what the rational man is, as well as what the merit of righteousness 
is. He must first have a distinct idea of all of these, and must also know that from the Divine the Lord was able to bring Himself into whatever states He pleased, and that He prepared Himself to 
enter temptation by bringing about many states. Although these matters are with man enveloped in obscurity like that of night, they are bathed in light like that of day with the angels; for the angels, 
dwelling in the light of heaven flowing from the Lord, see countless things - each distinctly - within those matters and others like them, and from the affection flowing in at the same time experience 
indescribable joy. From this it may become clear how far removed man's ability to understand and perceive is from angels' ability to do so. </p>

`Et ivit ad locum quem dixit ei Deus': quod significet statum tunc secundum perceptionem, constat a significatione `loci' quod sit status, de qua n. 1273-1277, 1376-1381, 2625; et ex significatione 
`dicere Deus' quod sit percipere ex Divino, de qua n. 2769, 2778.  Quod ipsum statum attinet, describitur ille in hoc versu, nempe status quem suscepit Dominus cum tentationes subiret, hic quem cum tentationes 
gravissimas et intimas; praeparatio prima ad illum statum fuit quod induerit statum pacis et innocentiae, tum quod praeparaverit naturalem hominem apud Se, ut et rationalem, ut inservirent Rationali 
Divino, quodque adjunxerit meritum justitiae, ac ita elevaverit Se: haec nusquam explicari possunt ad captum, aut 2 sisti ideae alicujus, qui nescit quod plures status simul {1} sint, et illi 
inter se distincti, tum qui nescit quid status pacis et innocentiae, quid naturalis homo, et quid rationalis, tum quid meritum justitiae; distinctam enim omnium illorum ideam primum habebit, et quoque 
sciet quod Dominus ex Divino quoscumque Ipsi placuit status Sibi inducere potuerit, et quod praeparaverit Se per inductos plures status ad tentationes; haec tametsi in obscuro quasi noctis sunt apud 
homines, usque in claro quasi diei sunt apud angelos, qui quia in luce caeli a Domino, innumerabilia in his et similibus distincte vident, et ex influente affectione tunc ineffabile gaudium percipiunt; 
inde, quantum intellectuale et perceptivum humanum distet ab intellectuali et perceptivo angelico, constare potest.      @1 in uno$ </p>
