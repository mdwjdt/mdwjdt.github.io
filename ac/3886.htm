<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3886节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3886.</strong>不过，要知道，天堂彼此间心跳和呼吸的变化多种多样，这些变化和那里的社群一样多。因为它们取决于各个社群所具有的思维与情感的状态，而这些状态又取决于其爱与信的状态。不过，天堂的普遍心跳和呼吸如上面所描述的那样。还有一次，我得以发觉属于脑后部区域的社群的心跳，并注意到那里每个属天社群和每个属灵社群的心跳。属天社群的心跳无声而柔和，而属灵社群的心跳强烈而振动。属灵心跳和属天心跳的比率是五比二，因为属天社群的心跳流入属灵社群的心跳，以这种比率发出并进入自然界。说来奇妙，属灵天使听不见属天天使的言语，却能以一种心跳感知到。这是因为属天天使的言语对属灵天使来说是不可理解的，它是由属于爱的情感产生的，而属灵天使的言语是由智性观念产生的（参看<a href="1647.htm">1647</a>，<a href="1759.htm">1759</a>，<a href="2157.htm">2157</a>，<a href="3343.htm">3343</a>节）。这些情感属于心脏区域，而这些观念则属于肺脏区域。</p>

But be it known that the variations in the heavens in respect to pulsations and respirations are manifold, being as many as are the societies; for they are according to the states of thought and affection 
with the angels; and these are according to their states of faith and love; but the general pulsation and respiration are as above described. Once also it was given me to observe the cardiac pulsation 
of those who were of the province of the hinder part of the head, and to note one by one the pulsations of the celestial and those of the spiritual in that province. The pulsations of the celestial 
were tacit and gentle; but those of the spiritual were strong and vibratory. The intervals of the pulsation of the spiritual were to those of the celestial as five to two; for the pulsation of the 
celestial inflows into that of the spiritual, and thus goes forth and passes into nature. And wonderful to say the speech of the celestial angels is not heard by the spiritual angels, but is perceived 
under the form of a pulsation of the heart; and this because the speech of the celestial angels is not intelligible to the spiritual angels, for it is produced by affections which are of love; whereas 
that of the spiritual is produced by intellectual ideas (see n. 1647, 1759, 2157, 3343); and the former belong to the province of the heart, but the latter to the province of the lungs. </p>

But it should be realized that variations in heartbeat and breathing from one heaven to another are manifold and that those variations are as many as the communities there. For those variations are determined 
by the differing states of thought and affection from one community to another, and those states are determined by the differing states of faith and love. But the general heartbeat and the general 
breathing of heaven is as has been described above. On yet another occasion I was allowed to observe the heartbeats of communities which belonged to the province of the back part of the head, to 
observe the heartbeat of each celestial community there and the heartbeat of each spiritual community. The heartbeats of the celestial communities were soundless and gentle whereas those of spiritual 
ones were strong and vibrating. There were five spiritual beats to every two celestial, for the heartbeat of the celestial communities flows into that of the spiritual, and in this ratio are emitted 
and pass into the natural creation. And marvel that it is, the speech of celestial angels is not something spiritual angels hear but something they perceive as a kind of heartbeat, the reason being that 
the speech of celestial angels is not intelligible to spiritual angels because it is produced through the affections which belong to love, whereas the speech of spiritual angels is produced through 
intellectual ideas, see <a href="1647.htm">1647</a>, <a href="1759.htm">1759</a>, <a href="2157.htm">2157</a>, <a href="3343.htm">3343</a>. And those affections belong to the province of the heart, but these ideas to that of the lungs. </p>

Sed sciendum quod variationes quoad pulsus et quoad respirationes in caelis{1} sint multiplices, et quod tot sint quot societates {2}, se enim ibi habent secundum status eorum cogitationis et affectionis, 
et hi secundum status fidei et amoris; </p>
<p>sed communis pulsus et communis respiratio se habet sicut supra dictum est.  Quondam etiam observare dabatur cardiacos pulsus eorum, qui ab occipitii 
provincia erant, et singillatim pulsus caelestium ibi, (c)et singillatim pulsus spiritualium ibi; </p>
<p>caelestium erant taciti et lenes, spiritualium autem fortes et vibratorii; momenta pulsus caelestium 
ibi erant ad spiritualium ut quinque {3} ad duo; influit enim pulsus caelestium in pulsum spiritualium et sic exit et transit in naturam.  Et quod mirabile, angelorum caelestium sermo non auditur 
ab angelis spiritualibus, sed percipitur sub specie {4} pulsus cordis et id ex causa quia sermo angelorum caelestium non intelligibilis est angelis spiritualibus, fit enim ille {5} per affectiones 
quae sunt amoris {6}, at spiritualium per ideas intellectuales, videatur n. 1647, 1759, 2157, 3343; et illae pertinent ad cordis provinciam, hac autem ad pulmonum. @1 caelo$ @2 i ibi$ @3 It is 
interesting to note that this ratio is also that of the sun's attractive force as compared with the moon's at the earth's surface.$ @4 sicut species$ @5 quia$ @6 i fit$ </p>
