<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9327节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9327.</strong>“我必在你面前差遣我的惊骇”表那些沉浸于虚假所产生的邪恶之人由于源自良善的真理所感到的惊恐。这从“惊骇”和“以色列人”的含义清楚可知：“惊骇”是指那些沉浸于虚假所产生的邪恶之人所感到的惊恐；惊骇将要被差遣在他们面前的“以色列人”是指那些处于属灵良善，也就是源自良善的真理之人（参看<a href="5803.htm">5803</a>，<a href="5806.htm">5806</a>，<a href="5812.htm">5812</a>，<a href="5817.htm">5817</a>，<a href="5819.htm">5819</a>，<a href="5820.htm">5820</a>，<a href="5833.htm">5833</a>，<a href="7957.htm">7957</a>，<a href="8234.htm">8234</a>，<a href="8805.htm">8805</a>节）。由于以色列人而感到惊骇的迦南地的各个民族表示由虚假所产生的邪恶和由邪恶所产生的虚假（参看<a href="1413.htm">1413</a>，<a href="1437.htm">1437</a>，<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="1573.htm">1573</a>，<a href="1574.htm">1574</a>，<a href="1868.htm">1868</a>，<a href="4517.htm">4517</a>，<a href="6306.htm">6306</a>，<a href="8065.htm">8065</a>，<a href="8317.htm">8317</a>节）。正因如此，“我必在你面前差遣我的惊骇”表示那些沉浸于虚假所产生的邪恶之人由于源自良善的真理所感到的惊恐。<br />此处的情形是这样：在灵界，一切能力皆来自源于良善的真理，因而来自从主发出的真理，或说由这些真理来提供。这一点从以下事实变得显而易见：主通过来自祂的真理将天堂的一切事物，地狱的一切事物，以及世上的一切事物都安排得井然有序。因为从主发出的神性真理就是实际的手段，一切事物皆通过这一手段而得以存在，一切事物也通过这一手段而得以持续存在。这一事实对那些唯独在物质层面进行思考的人来说，是无法理解的，如那些将万物的起源和持续存在都归因于自然界的人。这些人对真理没有任何概念，只是认为真理没有任何能力，因为它们仅仅是思维的对象，而思维在他们看来，不是一种本质实体，更不是什么实质性的东西；尽管他们知道思维支配整个身体，并使它的各个部位完全它自己的品质活动。他们也没有看到，宇宙万物无不与源自良善的真理有关。至于真理拥有所有能力，是至高无上的绝对本质实体，可参看前文（<a href="8200.htm">8200</a>节）。由此明显可知，天使从主所发出的神之真理中获得能力，并由此被称为“大能者”。至于源自良善的真理，也就是来自主的真理的性质，这从前面（<a href="4932.htm">4932</a>-<a href="4935.htm">4935</a>节）所记载的关于对应于这种真理的膀臂的经历可以看出来。<br />既然一切能力都属于真理，或说真理拥有一切能力，那么可知，邪恶所产生的虚假没有任何能力，因为这虚假就是源于良善的真理的一种缺失，因而是能力的一种缺失。因此，地狱里的人因都沉浸于邪恶所产生的虚假，故完全没有任何能力。正因如此，单单一位天使就能赶走、扔掉和驱散他们当中成千上万的人，就像用嘴吹空中的鸿毛一样。由此可见为何那些陷入邪恶所产生的虚假之人会由于源自良善的真理而感到惊恐。这惊恐被称为“神的惊骇”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创35.5.htm">35:5</a>；约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯13.21.htm">13:21</a>）。在以西结书：<br />我要将我的惊骇放在活人之地；他必被放在未受割礼的人中间，法老和他的群众跟那些被剑刺死的人在一起。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结32.32.htm">32:32</a>）<br />摩西五经：<br />我的律例你们若弃绝，我的典章你们的灵魂若憎恶，以致你们不遵行我一切的诫命，我就打发惊惶进他们的心，飘荡落叶的响声，要追赶他们；他们必逃跑，像人逃避剑。无人追赶，他们却要跌倒。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.15.htm">26:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.36.htm">36</a>）<br />这描述的是那些弃绝、憎恶律例、典章和诫命的人所经历，因而那些沉浸于虚假所产生的邪恶和邪恶所产生的虚假之人所感到的惊恐。经上之所以说，“飘荡落叶的响声，要追赶他们；他们必逃跑，像人逃避剑”，是因为“叶”表示真理（<a href="885.htm">885</a>节），“剑”表示与邪恶所产生的虚假争战的真理（<a href="2799.htm">2799</a>，<a href="6353.htm">6353</a>，<a href="8294.htm">8294</a>节）。这些人完全没有对抗真理的任何能力，这一点由“无人追赶，他们却要跌倒”来表示。</p>

I will send My terror before thee. That this signifies the terror of those who are in the evils of falsity, on account of the truths of good, is evident from the signification of "terror," as being the 
terror of those who are in the evils of falsity; and from the signification of "the sons of Israel," before whom the terror was to be sent, as being those who are in spiritual good, that is, in the 
truth of good (see n. 5803, 5806, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5820, 5833, 7957, 8234, 8805). (That the nations of the land of Canaan to whom terror was sent on account of the sons of Israel, signify the evils 
of falsity and the falsities of evil, see n. 1413, 1437, 1607, 1573, 1574, 1868, 4517, 6306, 8065, 8317.) Therefore by the words, "I will send My terror before thee" is signified the terror of those who 
are in the evils of falsity on account of the truths of good.  [2] The case herein is this. All power in the spiritual world is from the truths which are from good, thus from the truths which proceed 
from the Lord. This can be plainly seen from the fact that the Lord disposes all things in heaven, and all things in hell, and also all things in the world, by means of the truths which are from Himself; 
for the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord is that very thing through which all things have come into existence, and through which all things subsist. That this is so is not comprehended by 
those who think solely from what is material, as those think who ascribe the origin and maintenance of all things to nature. These can have no idea about truths except that they are devoid of power, 
being matters of mere thought, concerning which they perceive nothing essential, and still less anything substantial; although they know that the thought directs the whole body, and excites its parts 
to motion, precisely in accordance with its own quality; likewise that there is nothing in the universe that does not bear relation to the truth which is from good. (That it is truth which has all power, 
and which is the veriest essential, see n. 8200.) From all this it is evident that the angels have power from the truth Divine which is from the Lord, and that from this they are called "powers." 
The nature of the power possessed by truths from good, that is, truths from the Lord, may be seen from the experience recorded concerning the arm, which corresponds to such truth, in n. 4932-4935. [3] 
Seeing that truth has all power, it follows that falsity from evil has no power whatever, because it is the privation of truth from good, thus the privation of power. Consequently they who are in hell-all 
there being in falsities from evil-have no power whatever; and therefore thousands of them can be driven away, cast down, and dispersed by one angel of heaven, much as a mote in the air is driven 
away by the breath of the mouth. From all this it can be seen why those who are in the evils of falsity feel terror on account of the truths of good. This terror is called "the terror of God" (Gen. 
35:5; Job 13:21). And in these passages: </p>
<p>     I will put My terror in the land of the living; when he shall be made to lie down in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that are slain by the sword, 
even Pharaoh and all his multitude (Ezek. 32:32).      If he shall reject My statutes, and if your soul shall abhor My judgments, so that ye will not do all My commandments, I will send dismay into 
their hearts, that the sound of a driven leaf may chase them; and they may flee as one fleeth from the sword; and may fall when none pursueth (Lev. 26:15, 36); </p>
<p>here is described the terror of those 
who are in the evils of falsity, and in the falsities of evil. It is said that "the sound of a leaf shall chase them, and they shall flee as one fleeth from the sword" because "leaf" signifies truth 
(n. 885), and "sword" signifies truth fighting against the falsity of evil (n. 2799, 6353, 8294). That such have no power whatever against truth, is signified by "they shall fall when none pursueth." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9327</b></p><p><b>9327.</b>
'I will send My terror before you' means the terror felt, on account of truths springing from good, by those immersed in evils arising from falsity. This is clear from the meaning of 'terror' as the 
terror felt by those immersed in evils that arise from falsity; and from the meaning of 'the children of Israel', before whom the terror would be sent, as those governed by spiritual good, which is truth 
springing from good, dealt with in <a href="5803.htm">5803</a>, <a href="5806.htm">5806</a>, <a href="5812.htm">5812</a>, <a href="5817.htm">5817</a>, <a href="5819.htm">5819</a>, <a href="5826.htm">5826</a>, <a href="5833.htm">5833</a>, <a href="7957.htm">7957</a>, <a href="8234.htm">8234</a>, <a href="8805.htm">8805</a>. The nations in the land of Canaan who would feel terror on account of the children of Israel mean evils 
arising from falsity and falsities arising from evil, see <a href="1413.htm">1413</a>, <a href="1437.htm">1437</a>, <a href="1573.htm">1573</a>, <a href="1574.htm">1574</a>, <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>, <a href="1868.htm">1868</a>, <a href="4517.htm">4517</a>, <a href="6306.htm">6306</a>, <a href="8054.htm">8054</a>, <a href="8317.htm">8317</a>. So it is that 'I will send My terror before you' means the terror felt by those 
immersed in evils arising from falsity, on account of truths springing from good. The implications of all this are that all power in the spiritual world is provided by truths that spring from good, thus 
by truths that emanate from the Lord.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This is made perfectly clear by the consideration that the Lord arranges into order all things in heaven and all things in hell, as well as all things 
in the world, by means of truths coming from Him. For Divine Truth emanating from the Lord is the actual means by which all things are brought into being and by which all things are kept in being. This 
is incomprehensible to those who think on solely a material level, as those people do who attribute the origin and continued existence of all things to natural forces. These people cannot have any 
other idea about truths than this, that truths do not possess any power because they are solely objects of thought, and thought is not seen by them to be an essential entity, still less something substantial,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> 
even though they know that thought controls the whole body and causes individual parts to move in exact accord with its own disposition. Nor also do they see that in the whole of creation nothing 
exists which lacks connection with truth that springs from good. Regarding truth, that it holds all power within it and is a supreme essential entity, see <a href="8200.htm">8200</a>. From all this it is evident that 
angels possess power which they receive from God's truth that emanates from the Lord, and that this is why they are called 'powers'. As regards the nature of truths that spring from good, that is, of 
truths coming from the Lord, see my experience involving the arm which corresponds to such truth, spoken of in <a href="4932.htm">4932</a>-<a href="4935.htm">4935</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Since all power belongs to truth it follows that no power whatever resides 
in falsity arising from evil, since it is an absence of truth springing from good, and so is an absence of power. Therefore also those in hell, since all there are steeped in falsities arising from 
evil, have absolutely no power at all. This being so, thousands of them can be rebuffed, thrown down, and dispelled by a single angel, almost exactly as fluff in the air can be by a puff from the mouth. 
From this one may see the reason for the terror felt by those steeped in falsities arising from evil on account of truths springing from good. This terror is called 'the terror of God' in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2035:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 35:5</a>; 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Job%2013:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Job 13:21</a>; and in Ezekiel,  </p>
<p>I will put My terror in the land of the living, when he had been made to lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with those slain by the sword, Pharaoh and all his multitude. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2032:32&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 32:32</a>.  </p>
<p>And in Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
If you despise My statutes, and if your soul abhors My judgements, so that you do not do all My commandments, I will inject dismay into their heart, that the 
sound of a driven leaf may pursue them, and they may flee, like flight from the sword, and they may fall without [anyone] pursuing. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2026:15,%2036&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 26:15, 36</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This describes the terror experienced by those 
who despise and reject statutes, judgements, and commandments, thus that felt by those who are immersed in evils arising from falsity and in falsities arising from evil. It says that 'the sound of a 
leaf will pursue them, and they will flee, like flight from the sword'; and the reason why it says this is that 'a leaf' means truth, <a href="885.htm">885</a>, and 'the sword' truth engaged in conflict against falsity arising 
from evil, <a href="2799.htm">2799</a>, <a href="6353.htm">6353</a>, <a href="8294.htm">8294</a>. The fact that those people possess absolutely no power at all against truth is meant by 'they will fall without [anyone] pursuing'.

`filiorum Israelis, ante quos mitteretur terror' quod sint qui in bono spirituali seu vero boni, de qua n. 5803, 5806, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826 {1}, 5833, (x)7957, 8234, 8805; (x)quod gentes terrae

Meum mittam ante te' significetur {2} terror illorum qui in malis falsi pro veris boni. 	[2] Cum hoc ita se habet: omnis potentia in spirituali mundo est ex veris quae ex bono, ita ex veris quae procedunt 
a Domino; quod manifeste ex eo constare potest quod Dominus disponat omnia in caelo et omnia in inferno, tum omnia in mundo, per vera quae ab Ipso, nam Divinum Verum procedens a Domino est ipsum 
illud per quod omnia exstiterunt et per quod omnia subsistunt; quod ita sit, non comprehendunt illi qui solum cogitant ex materiali, qualiter cogitant illi qui naturae originem (o)et sustentationem 
omnium ascribunt; {3} hi non aliam ideam habere possunt {4} de veris quam quod sint nullius potentiae, quia solius cogitationis, de qua nihil essentiale, minus substantiale, percipiunt, tametsi sciunt 
quod cogitatio regat totum corpus, et excitet singula ejus in motum, prorsus secundum quale suum; tum quoque quod nihil non in universo se referat ad verum quod ex bono; quod verum sit cui omnis potentia,

veris ex Domino, videatur experientia quae de brachio, quod tali vero correspondet, n. 4932-4935 {6} allata est.(n) 	[3] Quia omnis potentia est veri, inde sequitur quod prorsus nulla potentia sit 
falso ex malo, hoc enim est privativum veri ex bono, ita privativum potentiae; quapropter etiam illi qui in inferno sunt, quia omnes ibi in falsis ex malo sunt, prorsus nihil potentiae habent {7}; possunt 
ideo milia eorum ab uno angelo caeli abigi, dejici, et dissipari, vix aliter ac floccus in aere per ventum oris.  Ex his videri potest unde terror illis qui in malis falsi {8} pro veris boni; hic 
terror vocatur `terror Dei,' Gen. xxxv 5; Hiob. xiii 21; et apud Ezechielem, 	Dabo terrorem Meum in terra viventium; dum cubare factus fuerit in medio praeputiatorum cum confossis gladio, Pharao et
