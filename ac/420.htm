<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第420节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>420.</strong>圣言提到各种乐器，每一种都有自己的意义，蒙主怜悯，这一点将在适当的地方予以说明。在此只引用以下诗篇经文：<br />我要在耶和华的帐棚里，献上欢呼的祭；我要唱诗歌颂耶和华。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗27.6.htm">27:6</a>）<br />“帐棚”表属天之物，“欢呼”、“唱诗”与“歌颂”表由此而来的属灵之物。再如：<br />义人哪，你们应当靠耶和华欢乐；正直人的赞美是合宜的。你们应当弹琴称谢耶和华，用十弦琴歌颂祂。应当向祂唱新歌，弹得巧妙，声音洪亮。因为耶和华的言语正直，凡祂所做的尽都诚实。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗33.1.htm">33:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗33.4.htm">4</a>）<br />这表信的真理，提及的这些事物与之相关。<br />②属灵事物，或信的真理与良善，通过竖琴和十弦瑟，以及唱歌之类的来赞美；而信的神圣或属天事物则通过诸如小号之类的管乐器来赞美。这就是为何圣殿中经常要用到这么多种乐器，以便用特定的乐器庆祝这样或那个的主题；由于这个原因，这些乐器逐渐被用来表示它们所赞美的主题。<br />③又如：<br />我的神啊，我要弹琴称赞你；以色列的圣者啊，我要鼓瑟歌颂你。我歌颂你的时候，我的嘴唇要欢呼；我的灵魂，就是你所救赎的，也要欢呼。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗71.22.htm">71:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗71.23.htm">23</a>）<br />这里还是表信的真理。再如：<br />你们要以坦白的心向耶和华回应，用琴向我们的神歌颂。”（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗147.7.htm">147:7</a>）<br />“坦白”与信的属天事物相关，因而提到了“耶和华”；而“用琴歌颂”与信的属灵事物相关，故而说到“神”。再如：<br />愿他们跳舞赞美祂的名，击鼓弹琴歌颂祂。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗149.3.htm">149:3</a>） <br />“鼓”表良善，“琴”表他们所赞美的真理。<br />④再如：<br />要用角声赞美祂，鼓瑟弹琴赞美祂。击鼓跳舞赞美祂，用丝弦的乐器和箫的声音赞美祂。用大响的钹赞美祂，用高声的钹赞美祂。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗150.3.htm">150:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗150.5.htm">5</a>）<br />这些乐器表作为赞美主题的信之良善与真理。可别以为这里提到了如此多不同乐器，除非各自都有独特的意义。再如，提到善与真的知识：<br />求你发出你的亮光和真实，好引导我，带我到你的圣山，到你的居所。我就走到神的祭坛，到我最喜乐的神那里。神啊，我的神，我要弹琴称赞你。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗43.3.htm">43:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗43.4.htm">4</a>）<br />⑤在以赛亚书中，提到属信的事物及其知识：<br />拿起琴来，走遍全城，弹奏美好的音符，唱响你的歌声，这样你可以被唤回记忆。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.16.htm">23:16</a>）<br />同样的表述在下列经文书中更为明显：<br />四活物和二十四位长老就俯伏在羔羊面前，各拿着琴和盛满了香的金炉，这香就是众圣牌坊的祈祷。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启5.8.htm">5:8</a>）<br />显而易见，活物与长老并没有拿琴，而是以“琴”来表信之真理，以“盛满了香的金炉”来表信之良善。在诗篇中，弹奏这些乐器被称为“赞美”和“坦白”（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗42.5.htm">42:5</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗69.31.htm">69:31</a>）。又如：<br />我听见从天上有声音，像众水的声音。我听见琴师弹奏的琴声。他们在唱新歌。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.2.htm">14:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.3.htm">3</a>）<br />再如：<br />我看见他们站在玻璃海上，拿着神的琴。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启15.2.htm">15:2</a>）<br />值得一提的是，天使与灵根据其善与真的不同来区分声音，不但区分歌声和乐器声，还区分嗓音。他们不接纳任何不一致的声音，所以，那里的声音和乐器都与良善和真理的性质和本质和谐一致。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]420.</strong> The Word mentions various instruments, each of which has its own symbolism. These will, by the Lord's divine mercy, be explained in the appropriate places.{*1} For the moment let me restrict myself to the following in David:<br />I will offer in Jehovah's tent the sacrifices of shouting; I will sing and make music to Jehovah. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_420/bible_king-james-version_psalms_27_6" target=_top>Psalms 27:6</a>)<br />The tent expresses the idea of something heavenly, and the shouting, singing, and music-making something spiritual that grows out of it. In the same author:<br />Sing [for joy] in Jehovah, you who show justice. For the upright, praise of him is beautiful. Give thanks to Jehovah on a harp; on a ten-string lute make music to him. Sing him a new song, make your strumming excel in its clamor, because Jehovah's word is upright, and every work of his is done in truth. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_420/bible_king-james-version_psalms_33_1-2" target=_top>Psalms 33:1-2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_420/bible_king-james-version_psalms_33_3" target=_top>3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_420/bible_king-james-version_psalms_33_4" target=_top>4</a>)<br />These stand for religious truth; everything said applies to that truth.<br />[2] Spiritual things, which are the truth and goodness involved in faith, were celebrated by harp and lute, by song, and by similar music. The holy or heavenly aspects of faith were celebrated by wind instruments — horns and so on. This is why so many instruments were connected with the Temple and why it says so many times that certain instruments were used in celebrating this thing or that. So the instruments are taken to mean the very qualities themselves that the instruments were honoring, as those just discussed are.<br />[3] In the same author:<br />I will give thanks to you on the lute; your truth, my God, I will play as music to you on the harp, Holy One of Israel. My lips will sing when I make music to you, as will my soul, which you redeemed. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_420/bible_king-james-version_psalms_71_22-23" target=_top>Psalms 71:22-23</a>)<br />This too is about religious truth. In the same author:<br />Answer Jehovah with thanksgiving; make music to our God on a harp. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_420/bible_king-james-version_psalms_147_7" target=_top>Psalms 147:7</a>)<br />The giving of thanks here is about the heavenly aspects of faith, which is why the name Jehovah is used, and making music with a harp is about the spiritual aspects, which is why the name God is used. In the same author:<br />Let them praise Jehovah's name in dance; on tambourine and harp let them make music to him. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_420/bible_king-james-version_psalms_149_3" target=_top>Psalms 149:3</a>)<br />The tambourine stands for good, and the harp, for truth, which the people are praising.<br />[4] In the same author:<br />Praise God with the blare of a horn. Praise him on lute and harp. Praise him on tambourine and in dance. Praise him on strings and organ. Praise him with loud cymbals. Praise him with shouting cymbals. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_420/bible_king-james-version_psalms_150_3-4" target=_top>Psalms 150:3-4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_420/bible_king-james-version_psalms_150_5" target=_top>5</a>)<br />These stand for religious goodness and truth, for which the people are offering praise. Do not imagine that so many instruments would be named if they did not each symbolize something. In the same author:<br />Send your light and your truth. Let them lead me; let them bring me to your holy mountain and to your dwelling places. And I will go in to God's altar, to the God of my happiness and joy, and I will give thanks to you with a harp, God, my God. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_420/bible_king-james-version_psalms_43_3-4" target=_top>Psalms 43:3-4</a>)<br />These things stand for knowledge of goodness and truth.<br />[5] In Isaiah:<br />Take a harp, circle the city, strum well, multiply your singing, in order to be remembered. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_420/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_23_16" target=_top>Isaiah 23:16</a>)<br />These types of music stand for the attributes of faith and of religious knowledge. Still more clearly in John:<br />The four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each of them having harps and golden bowls full of pieces of incense, which are the prayers of the godly. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_420/bible_king-james-version_revelation_5_8" target=_top>Revelation 5:8</a>)<br />Anyone can see that they did not have harps but rather that the harps symbolize religious truth, and the golden bowls full of incense symbolize religious good. In David, in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_420/bible_king-james-version_psalms_42_4" target=_top>Psalms 42:4</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_420/bible_king-james-version_psalms_69_30" target=_top>69:30</a>, the music made by instruments is called praise and thanksgiving. Elsewhere in John:<br />I heard a sound from the sky like that of many waters. I heard the sound of harpists strumming on their harps; they were singing a new song. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_420/bible_king-james-version_revelation_14_2-3" target=_top>Revelation 14:2-3</a>)<br />And in another place:<br />Men were standing next to the glassy sea, having God's harps. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_420/bible_king-james-version_revelation_15_2" target=_top>Revelation 15:2</a>)<br />It is noteworthy that angels and spirits distinguish sounds on the basis of differences in goodness and truth. They do this with the sounds not only of singing and instruments but also of words, and they refuse to listen to any but those that harmonize. The result is concord between the sounds (and so the instruments) on one hand and the nature and essence of good and truth on the other.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg's statement here that explanations of individual instruments in Scripture will occur at the "appropriate places" may be another indication that at the time of writing, he planned Secrets of Heaven as a full exegesis of all Scripture; see note 3 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_420/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_66" target=_top>66</a> and the reader's guide, pages 24-25 note 14 [NCBSP: Available from Swedenborg Foundation]. Ultimately, however, the primary exegesis in Secrets of Heaven was limited to Genesis and Exodus. The musical instruments mentioned in these two biblical books are the organ (Latin organum), whose meaning is given here; the harp (Latin cithara), here and at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_420/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4138" target=_top>4138</a>; the tambourine (Latin tympanum), in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_420/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4138" target=_top>4138</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_420/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_8337" target=_top>8337</a>; one type of trumpet (Latin jobel), at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_420/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_8802" target=_top>8802</a>; and another type of trumpet (Latin buccina), at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_420/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_8815" target=_top>8815</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_420/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_8823" target=_top>8823</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_420/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_8915" target=_top>8915</a>.

In the Word mention is made of various instruments, each having its own signification, as will be shown, of the Lord's Divine mercy, in its proper place; here however we shall adduce only what is said 
in David: </p>
<p>     I will sacrifice in the tent of Jehovah sacrifices of shouting, I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto Jehovah (Ps. 27:6), where by "tent" is expressed what is celestial, and by 
"shouting" "singing" and "singing praises" what is spiritual thence derived. Again: </p>
<p>     Sing unto Jehovah, O ye righteous, for His praise is comely for the upright; confess ye to Jehovah on the harp, 
sing unto Him with the psaltery, an instrument of ten strings. Sing unto Him a new song, play skillfully with a loud noise; for the Word of Jehovah is right, and all His work is in the truth (Ps. 33:1-4), denoting 
the truths of faith, concerning which these things are said.      [2] Spiritual things, or the truths and goods of faith, were celebrated with the harp and psaltery, with singing and 
analogous instruments, but the holy or celestial things of faith were celebrated with wind instruments, such as trumpets and the like; and this was why so many instruments were used about the temple 
and so often, in order that this or that subject might be celebrated with certain instruments; and in consequence of this the instruments came to be taken and understood for the subjects that were celebrated 
with them. [3] Again: </p>
<p>     I will confess to Thee with the psaltery, even Thy truth, O my God; unto Thee will I sing praises with the harp, O Thou Holy One of Israel; my lips shall sing when 
I sing praises unto Thee, and my soul which Thou hast redeemed (Ps. 71:22, 23), where also the truths of faith are signified. Again: </p>
<p>     Answer to Jehovah in confession, sing praises upon the harp 
unto our God (Ps. 147:7) "confession" has respect to the celestial things of faith, and therefore mention is made of "Jehovah;" and to "sing praises upon the harp" has reference to the spiritual things 
of faith, wherefore "God" is spoken of. Again: </p>
<p>     Let them praise the name of Jehovah in the dance, let them sing praises unto Him with the timbrel and harp (Ps. 49:3), where the "timbrel" signifies 
good, and the "harp" truth, which they praise. [4] Again: </p>
<p>     Praise God with the sound of the trumpet; praise Him with the psaltery and harp; praise Him with the timbrel and dance; praise Him 
with stringed instruments and the organ; praise Him upon the loud cymbals; praise Him upon the cymbals of shouting (Ps. 150:3, 4, 5). These instruments denote the goods and the truths of faith which 
were the subjects of praise; for let no one believe that so many different instruments would have been here mentioned unless each had a distinct signification. Again, referring to the knowledges of good 
and truth: </p>
<p>     O send out Thy light and Thy truth, let them lead me, let them bring me unto the mountain of Thy holiness, and to Thy habitations, and I will go in to the altar of God, unto God, 
the gladness of my exultation; yea, I will confess unto Thee upon the harp, O God, my God (Ps. 43:3, 4). [5] In Isaiah, referring to the things that are of faith, and the knowledges thereof: </p>
<p>     Take 
a harp, go about the city, play well, sing many songs, that thou mayest be called to remembrance (Isa. 23:16). The same is expressed still more plainly in John: </p>
<p>     The four animals and the four 
and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having everyone of them harps, and golden vials full of incense offerings, which are the prayers of the saints (Rev. 5:8),  where it must be evident to everyone 
that the animals and elders had not harps, but that by "harps" are signified the truths of faith, and by "golden vials full of incense offerings" the goods of faith. In David the performances 
on the instruments are called "praises" and "confessions" (Ps. 42:5; 69:31). And in another place in John: </p>
<p>     I heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters, and I heard the voice of harpers 
harping with their harps, and they sang a new song (Rev. 14:2-3). And in another place: </p>
<p>     I saw them standing by the sea of glass having the harps of God (Rev. 15:2).It is worthy of mention that 
angels and spirits distinguish sounds according to their differences with respect to good and truth, not only those produced in singing and by instruments, but also those of voices; and they admit 
none but such as are in accord, so that there may be a concord of the sounds, and consequently of the instruments, with the nature and essence of the good and the true. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 420</b></p><p><b>420.</b>
Various types of instruments are mentioned in the Word, each one having its own particular meaning, which will in the Lord's Divine mercy be shown when they occur. For the present let just the following 
in David be quoted,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will sacrifice in the tent of Jehovah the sacrifices of shouts of joy; I will sing and make melody to Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2027:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 27:6</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'tent' is used to express that which is 
celestial, and 'shouts of joy', 'singing', and 'making melody' that which is spiritual deriving from it. In the same author,  </p>
<blockquote>
Sing to Jehovah, O you righteous! His praise befits upright men. Confess 
Jehovah with the harp, make melody to Him on a ten-stringed lyre. Sing to Him a new song, play skillfully with a loud note, for the word of Jehovah is upright, and all His work is done in truth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2033:1-4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 33:1-4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This stands for truths of faith, to which these commands have reference.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Spiritual things, which are the truths and goods of faith, were extolled by means of the harp, ten-stringed 
lyres, singing, and the like, whereas the holy or celestial things of faith were praised by means of wind instruments, such as trumpets and others like them. This explains why so many instruments were 
used around the Temple, for so often particular instruments were needed to celebrate this occasion or that. As a consequence those instruments came to mean the actual things in praise of which they 
were used.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the same author,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will confess to You on a ten-stringed instrument, Your truth, O my God. I will make melody to You with the harp, O Holy One of Israel. My lips will sing when 
I make melody to You; and my soul which You have redeemed. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2071:22,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 71:22, 13</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This similarly refers to the truths of faith. In the same author,  </p>
<blockquote>
Reply to Jehovah with confession; make melody to 
our God with the harp. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20147:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 147:7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'confession' has regard to the celestial things of faith, which is why the name 'Jehovah' is used, while 'making melody with the harp' has regard to the spiritual 
things of faith, which is why the name 'God' is used. In the same author,  </p>
<blockquote>
Let them praise the name of Jehovah with dancing; with timbrel and harp let them make melody to Him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20149:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 149:3</a>.   
</blockquote>
'Timbrel' 
stands for the good and 'harp' for the truth which they are praising. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the same author,  </p>
<blockquote>
Praise God with trumpet-sound; praise Him with a ten-stringed lyre and with a harp, praise 
Him with timbrel and dance; praise Him with stringed instruments and organs, praise and Him with sounding cymbals<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> praise Him with high-sounding cymbals.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20150:3-5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 150:3-5</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>These stand for the goods and 
truths of faith, which occasion praise. Let no one think that so many instruments are mentioned by name without each one having some particular meaning. In the same author,  </p>
<blockquote>
Send out Your light 
and Your truth; let them lead me, let them bring me to Your holy mountain and to Your dwellings. Then I will go in to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy, and I will confess You with the harp, O 
God, my God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2043:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 43:3, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This stands for cognitions of good and truth.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Take a harp, encompass the city, strike a good note, increase your song, that you may be called to memory. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2023:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 23:16</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This stands for matters of faith and cognitions of faith. The point is plainer still in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
The four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, 
each holding a harp, and with golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%205:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 5:8</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Harps' being held is not the meaning, as may be clear to anyone. Instead the truths of faith 
are meant by 'harps', and the goods of faith by 'golden bowls full of incense'. In David sounds made on instruments are referred to as 'praises and confessions', in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2042:4;%2069:70&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 42:4; 69:70</a>. And elsewhere 
in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
I heard a voice from heaven, like the sound of many waters. I heard the sound of harpers playing on their harps. They were singing a new song. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2014:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 14:2, 3</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere in the same 
book,  </p>
<blockquote>
I saw them standing beside the sea of glass holding harps of God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2015:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 15:2</a>.

<p>It deserves to be mentioned that angels and spirits distinguish sounds on the basis of the differences that 
exist with good and truth. This applies not only to the sounds made by singing and instruments, but also to those made by voices. They do not entertain any sounds other than those that are accordant, 
so that there may be an accordance of the sounds, and therefore of the instruments, with the very nature and essence of good and truth.

In Verbo varia instrumenta memorantur, et singula Suam significationem habent, de quibus, ex Divina Domini misericordia, suis locis: nunc solum quae apud Davidem, 	Sacrificabo in tentorio Jehovae sacrificia 
vociferationis, canam et psallam Jehovae, Ps. xxvii 6; </p>
<p>ubi per 'tentorium' coeleste, et per 'vociferationem, canere et psallere' spirituale inde, exprimitur: apud eundem, 	Cantate justi in 
Jehovah, rectis decora est laus ejus; confitemini Jehovae in cithara, in nablio decachordo psallite Illi; cantate Illi canticum novum, reddite egregium pulsare 	clangore; quia rectum verbum Jehovae, 
et omne opus Ipsius in veritate, Ps. xxxiii 1-4; </p>
<p>[2]	pro veris fidei, de quibus praedicantur: spiritualia seu vera et bona fidei celebrabantur per citharam et nablia, per cantum, et similia; at sancta 
seu caelestia fidei per instrumenta flatus, ut buccinas, et similia; unde tot instrumenta circa templum, et toties quod certis instrumentis hoc aut illud celebraretur; inde instrumenta pro ipsis rebus 
quae celebrabantur per ea, assumpta et intellecta sunt, ut haec de quibus:  [3] apud eundem, 	Confitebor Tibi instrumento nablii, veritatem Tuam, Deus mi; psallam Tibi cithara, Sancte Israelis; canent 
labia mea, cum psallo Tibi, et anima mea, quam redemisti,  Ps. lxxi 	22, 23; </p>
<p>ubi similiter de veris fidei: apud eundem, 	Respondete Jehovae in confessione, psallite Deo nostro in cithara, ps. 
cxlvii 7; </p>
<p>ubi 'confessio' spectat caelestia fidei, quare dicitur 'Jehovah'; et 'psallere cithara' spiritualia fidei, quare dicitur 'Deus:' apud eundem, 	Laudent nomen Jehovae in chorea, in tympano et 
cithara psallant Ipsi, Ps. cxlix 3; </p>
<p>[4]	'tympanum' pro bono, et 'cithara' pro vero, quod laudant:  apud eandem, 	Laudate Deum in clangore buccinae: laudate Ipsum in nablio et cithara; laudate Ipsum 
in tympano et chorea; laudate Ipsum in fidibus et organo; laudate Ipsum cum cymbalis auditus; lauda' Ipsum cum cymbalis vociferationis, Ps. cl 3-5; </p>
<p>pro bonis et veris fidei, propter quae laudatio: 
nec quis credat quod tot instrumenta nominentur nisi quodlibet aliquid significet: apud eundem, 	Mite lucem Tuam et veritatem Tuam, hae ducant me, deducant ad montem sanctitatis Tuae, et ad habitacula 
Tua, et 	ingrediar ad altare Dei, ad Deum, laetitiae exsultationis 	meae, confiteborque Tibi cithara, Deus, Deus mi,  Ps. xliii 3, 4; </p>
<p>        [5] pro cognitionibus boni et veri: apud Esaiam,     
                    	Accipe citharam, circui urbem,... bene pulsa, multiplica cantum, ut in memoriam revoceris, xxiii 16; </p>
<p>                    pro iis quae sunt fidei et cognitionum ejus: adhuc manifestius 
apud Johannem,                                                       	Quatuor animalia, et viginti quatuor seniores ceciderunt ante Agnum, habentes quilibet citharas, et phialas aureas plenas 
suffimentis, quae sunt orationes sanctorum, Apoc. v 8;           quod non habuerint citharas, cuique constare potest, sed quod significentur vera fidei per 'citharas' et bona fidei per 'phialas aureas 
plenas suffimentis.' Apud Davidem appellantur 'laudes et confessiones' quae per instrumenta fiebant, Ps. xlii 5 [A.V. 4]; lxix 31 [A.V. 30]: et alibi apud Johannem,                              
                     	Audivi vocem e caelo, tanquam aquarum multarum;... audivi vocem {x}citharoedorum pulsantium in citharis suis, canebant canticum novum, Apoc. xiv 2 [3]: </p>
<p>                        
      et alibi,                                                                   Vidi stantes juxta mare vitreum habentes citharas Dei, Apoc. xv 2.                                                  Memorabile 
est quod angeli et spiritus secundum differentias quoad bonum et verum distinguant sonos, non solum cantus et instrumentorum sed etiam vocum; nec nisi tales admittant, quam quae concordant; 
ita ut sit concordantia sonorum, proinde instrumentorum, cum natura et essentia boni et veri. </p>
