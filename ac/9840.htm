Verses 9-14. And thou shalt take two onyx stones, and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel; six of their names on the one stone, and the names of the six that remain on the other stone, according 
to their generations. With the work of a worker in stone, with the engravings of a signet, shalt thou engrave the two stones, according to the names of the sons of Israel; encompassed with settings 
of gold shalt thou make them. And thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulders of the ephod, to be stones of remembrance for the sons of Israel; and Aaron shall bear their names before Jehovah 
upon his two shoulders for a remembrance. And thou shalt make settings of gold, and two chains of pure gold; from their borders shalt thou make them, with cord-work; and thou shalt put the chains of 
cords on the settings. "And thou shalt take two onyx stones," signifies the interior memory which is from the truths of faith that are from love; "and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel," 
signifies on which have been impressed the truths and goods of the spiritual kingdom in respect to all their quality; "six of their names on the one stone," signifies the whole quality of truths from 
good; "and the names of the six that remain on the other stone," signifies all the quality of truths through which is good; "according to their generations," signifies each in that order in which the 
one is generated and proceeds from the other; "with the work of a worker in stone, with the engravings of a signet, shalt thou engrave the two stones, according to the names of the sons of Israel," 
signifies the heavenly form of all truths in their order in the memory from the good of love, thus intellectual things therein with the regenerate according to their arrangement in order by the will; 
"encompassed with settings of gold shalt thou make them," signifies coming-forth and subsistence from good; "and thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulders of the ephod," signifies the preservation 
of good and truth with all exertion and power; "to be stones of remembrance for the sons of Israel," signifies from mercy forever for the spiritual kingdom; "and Aaron shall bear their names before 
Jehovah upon his two shoulders for a remembrance," signifies a representative of the Divine preservation of good and truth forever, from mercy; "and thou shalt make settings of gold," signifies a continual 
coming-forth and subsistence from good; "and two chains of pure gold," signifies a coherence with the good of the whole kingdom; "from their borders shalt thou make them," signifies from the 
extremes through which there is influx; "with cord-work," signifies the method of the conjunction; "and thou shalt put the chains of cords upon the settings," signifies conjunction with the good from 
which are truths, and in this way the preservation of the spiritual kingdom, with all exertion and power. </p>

Verses 9-14 And you shall take two shoham<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> stones, and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel, six of their names on one stone, and the remaining six names on the other stone, according to their 
generations.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> With the work of one who works on stones,<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> [like] the engravings of a signet, you shall engrave the two stones with the names of the sons of Israel; enclosed in sockets of gold you 
shall make them. And you shall place the two stones on the shoulders of the ephod, as stones of remembrance for the sons of Israel; and Aaron shall bear their names before Jehovah on his two shoulders 
for remembrance. And you shall make sockets of gold; and two small chains of pure gold; on the borders<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a> you shall make them, with the work of slender rope;<A name="fntext5"></a><A href="#fn5"><sup>e</sup></a> and you shall put the small chains 
of slender rope in the sockets.  </p>
<p>'And you shall take two shoham stones' means the interior memory formed from the truths of faith that spring from love. 'And engrave on them the names of the sons 
of Israel' means on which the truths and forms of good that belong to the spiritual kingdom - the entire essential nature of them - have been imprinted. 'Six of their names on one stone' means the entire 
essential nature of truths springing from good. 'And the remaining six names on the other stone' means the [entire] essential nature of truths through which good comes. 'According to their generations' 
means both kinds in the order in which they are begotten and proceed one from the other. 'With the work of one who works on stones, [like] the engravings of a signet, you shall engrave the two 
stones with the names of the sons of Israel' means the heavenly pattern which all the truths arranged into their proper order in the memory by the good of love take on, that is, the truths there which 
have been grasped by a regenerated person's understanding and then set in order by his will. 'Enclosed in sockets of gold you shall make them' means their being brought into being and kept in being 
by good. 'And you shall place the two stones on the shoulders of the ephod' means the preservation of good and truth by all exertion and power. 'As stones of remembrance for the sons of Israel' means 
out of mercy, for evermore for the spiritual kingdom. 'And Aaron shall bear their names before Jehovah on his two shoulders for remembrance' means a representative sign of the Divine preservation of good 
and truth for evermore, out of mercy. 'And you shall make sockets of gold' means being brought into being and kept unceasingly in being by good. 'And two small chains of pure gold' means coherence 
with the good of the whole kingdom. 'On the borders you shall make them' means at the most external parts through which influx comes. 'With the work of slender rope' means the mode of the joining together. 
'And you shall put the small chains of slender rope in the sockets' means being joined to the good from which truths spring, and so the preservation of the spiritual kingdom by all exertion and 
power.

Vers. 9-14. Et accipies duos lapides schoham, et sculpes super illis nomina filiorum Israelis. Sex de nominibus illorum super lapide uno, et nomina sex reliqua super lapide altero, secundum generationes 
illorum. Opere opificis lapidis, sculpturis sigilli sculpes duos lapides super nominibus filiorum Israelis; circumdatos fundis auri facies illos. Et pones duos lapides super umeris ephodi, lapides 
recordationis filiis Israelis, et feret Aharon nomina illorum coram Jehovah super duobus umeris ejus ad recordationem. Et facies fundas auri. Et duas catenulas auri puri, a terminis facies illas, opere 
funiculi; et dabis catenulas funiculorum super fundis. `Et accipies duos lapides schoham' (x)significat memoriam interiorem quae ex veris fidei quae ex amore: `et sculpes super illis nomina filiorum 
Israelis' significat cui impressa sunt vera et bona regni spiritualis quoad omne quale eorum: `sex de nominibus illorum super lapide uno' significat omne quale verorum ex bono: `et nomina sex reliqua

et veri omni opera et potentia: `lapides recordationis filiis Israelis' significat ex misericordia in perpetuum regno spirituali: `et feret Aharon nomina illorum coram Jehovah super duobus umeris ejus 
ad recordationem' significat repraesentativum Divinae conservationis boni et veri in perpetuum ex misericordia: `et facies fundas auri' significat existentiam et subsistentiam ex bono continuam: `et 
duas catenulas auri puri' significat cohaerentiam cum bono totius regni: `a terminis facies illas' significat ab extremis per quae influxus: `opere funiculi' significat modum conjunctionis: `et dabis 
catenulas funiculorum super fundis' significat conjunctionem cum bono ex quo vera, et sic conservationem regni spiritualis omni opera et potentia. </p>
