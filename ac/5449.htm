<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5449节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5449.</strong>“我指着法老的性命起誓”表一种确定性。这从以下事实清楚可知：“指着法老的性命起誓”是指一种强调式的说法，因而是陈述一种确定性。约瑟的确知道他们不是奸细，也不是来窥探这地虚实的；然而，他之所以仍如此断言，是因为就内义而言，所描述的是一种确定性；即对以下事实的确定：教会真理无论在谁里面，若不通过良善与内层人联结，只会以物质利益为目的。但是，一旦通过良善与内层人联结，他们就会以良善与真理本身，因而以教会，主的国度和主自己为目的。当人们以这些为目的时，物质利益随着他们的需要自然会到来，正如主在马太福音中所说的：<br />你们要先求神的国和祂的义，这些东西都要加给你们了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太6.33.htm">6:33</a>）</p>

By the life of Pharaoh. That this signifies of a certainty, is evident from the fact that "by the life of Pharaoh," is a form of emphatic assertion, thus implying that it is certain. Joseph indeed knew 
that they were not spies, and that they did not come to see the nakedness of the land; yet he so asserted because in the internal sense it was certain that the truths of the church, in whomsoever they 
are, without conjunction through good with the interior man, have as the end nothing but gain; but when they have been conjoined through good with the interior man, they have as the end good and truth 
itself, thus the church, the Lord's kingdom, and the Lord Himself; and when they have these as the end, then as much gain falls to their share as is needed, according to the Lord's words in Matthew: </p>
<p> 
    Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness, and all things shall be added unto you (Matt. 6:33). </p>

'As sure as Pharaoh lives' means a certainty. This is clear from the fact that 'as sure as Pharaoh lives' is a phrase that is employed to say something emphatically, thus to state a certainty. Joseph, 
it is true, knew they were not spies and that they had not come to see the nakedness of the land; nevertheless he used that phrase because of the certainty described in the internal sense - the certainty 
that unless they are joined by means of good to the interior man, the truths known to the Church, with whomsoever they are present, possess no other end in view than material gain. But once they 
have become joined through good to the interior man they have what is really good and true, and so the Church, the Lord's kingdom, and the Lord Himself as their end in view. And when people have these 
as their end in view, material gain also comes their way, insofar as they have need of it, in keeping with the Lord's words in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all 
these things will be added to you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%206:33&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 6:33</a>.

`Vivat Pharaoh':  quod significet certum, constat ex eo quod `vivat Pharaoh' sit formula asseverandi, ita quod certum sit; novit quidem Joseph quod non exploratores essent, et quod non venerint ad videndum 
nuditatem terrae, at usque ita {1}asseveravit quia certum quod in sensu interno, nempe quod vera Ecclesiae absque conjunctione per bonum cum interiore homine, non aliud pro fine habeant quam lucrum 
apud quemcumque sint; at cum conjuncta sunt per bonum cum interiore homine, quod pro fine habeant ipsum bonum et verum, ita Ecclesiam, regnum Domini et Ipsum Dominum; et cum haec pro fine habent, 
tunc etiam cedit illis lucrum quanto opus, secundum Domini verba apud Matthaeum, 	Quaerite {2}primum regnum Dei et justitiam {3}Ipsius, et omnia adjicientur vobis, vi 33. @1 dixit$  @2 primo$ @3 ejus$ </p>
