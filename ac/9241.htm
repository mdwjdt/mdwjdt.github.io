<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9241节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9241.</strong>不过，至于被称为信仰本身的信靠或保障和信心，情况是这样：那些爱自己爱世界的人，也就是陷入邪恶和它们所产生的虚假之人不可能拥有这种信仰，因为他们的心没有转向神，而是转向了自己和世界。但那些处于对邻之仁和对主之爱的人则能拥有这种信仰，因为他们的心转向主。这也是主在约翰福音中所教导的：<br />凡接待祂的，就是信祂名的人，祂就赐他们权柄，作神的儿女。这等人不是从血气生的，不是从肉欲生的，也不是从人意生的，乃是从神生的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.12.htm">1:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.13.htm">13</a>）<br />“从血气、肉欲、人意生的”是指那些陷入源于爱自己爱世界的邪恶和虚假之人。“从神生的”是指那些处于来自主的仁和信之良善的人（参看<a href="5826.htm">5826</a>节）。</p>

But in regard to the trust and confidence which is called Faith itself, the case is this. Those who are in the love of self and of the world, that is, those who are in evils and the consequent falsities, 
cannot have this Faith, for their heart is not toward God, but toward themselves and the world. Whereas those who are in charity toward the neighbor and in love to the Lord can have such Faith, for 
their heart is toward the Lord. This the Lord also teaches in John: </p>
<p>     As many as received Him, to them gave He the power to be the sons of God, even to those who believe in His name; who were born, 
not of bloods, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God (John 1:12-13); </p>
<p>those who are "born of bloods, of the will of the flesh, and of the will of man," are those who are 
in what is evil and false from the loves of self and of the world. And those who are "born of God" are those who are in the good of charity and of faith from the Lord (see n. 5826). </p>

But the situation with assurance and confidence, as faith itself is called, is that people ruled by self-love and love of the world, that is, by evils and the falsities that arise from them, cannot possess 
that faith since their heart is not turned towards God, but towards self and the world. But those governed by charity towards the neighbour and love to the Lord can possess such faith since their 
heart is turned towards the Lord. This is also what the Lord teaches in John,  </p>

of blood<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man (vir), but of God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:12, 13</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'People born of blood, the will of the flesh, and the will of man' are those who are ruled by evil 
and falsity that spring from self-love and love of the world; and 'people born of God' are those who are governed by the good of charity and faith that come from the Lord, see <a href="5826.htm">5826</a>.

Sed cum fiducia et confidentia, quae vocatur ipsa fides, ita se habet: qui in amore sui et mundi sunt, hoc est, qui in malis et inde falsis, non possunt illam fidem habere, nam cor eorum non est ad 
Deum sed ad seipsos et ad mundum, at qui in charitate erga proximum {1}sunt et in amore in Dominum, illi possunt talem fidem habere, nam cor eorum est ad Dominum; hoc etiam Dominus docet apud Johannem, Quotquot 
receperunt, dedit illis potestatem ut filii Dei essent, credentibus in nomen Ipsius; qui non ex sanguinibus, neque ex voluntate carnis, neque ex voluntate viri, sed ex Deo nati sunt, i 12,
