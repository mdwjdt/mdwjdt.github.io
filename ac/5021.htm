<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5021.</strong>创世记39:16-18.妇人把约瑟的衣裳放在自己那里，等着他的主来到家里。就照这些话向他讲述，说，你给我们带来的那希伯来仆人到我这里来，要调戏我；于是我抬高声音喊叫，他就把衣裳丢在我这里逃出去了。<br />“妇人把约瑟的衣裳放在自己那里”表它保留了最外层的真理。“等着他的主来到家里”表好使它可以与属世良善交流。“就照这些话向他讲述”表说谎。“说，你给我们带来的那希伯来仆人到我这里来”表那仆人或卑贱之物。“要调戏我”表它起来。“于是我抬高声音喊叫”表当感到极大厌恶时。“他就把衣裳丢在我这里”表证据。“逃出去了”表那时它将自己分离出去。</p>

Verses 16-18. And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came to his house. And she spoke unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant whom thou hast brought unto us came unto 
me to mock me; and it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled out. "And she laid up his garment by her," signifies that it retained ultimate truth; 
"until his lord came to his house," signifies that it might communicate with natural good; "and she spoke unto him according to these words," signifies false speaking; "saying, The Hebrew servant whom 
thou hast brought unto us, came unto me," signifies that servant; "to mock me," signifies that it rose up; "and it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried," signifies when great aversion was 
perceived; "that he left his garment by me," signifies testification; "and fled out," signifies that then it separated itself. </p>

<p>And she kept his garment with her' means that it retained outermost truth. 'Until 
his lord came to his house' means so that it might communicate with natural good. 'And she spoke to him in these words' means speaking falsely. 'Saying, The Hebrew slave whom you have brought to us 
came to me' means that servile thing. 'To make sport of me' means that it rose up. 'And it happened as I lifted up my voice and cried out' means when it discerned the great aversion. 'That he left his 
garment with me' means proof. 'And fled out of doors' means that at that point it separated itself.

Vers. 16-18.  Et reposuit vestem ejus apud se, usque venire dominum ejus ad domum suam.  Et locuta ad illum secundum verba haec, dicendo, Venit ad me servus Hebraeus, quem adduxisti nobis, ad illudendum 
mihi.  Et factum, sicut tollere me vocem meam, et clamavi, et reliquit vestem suam apud me, et fugit foras.  `Et reposuit vestem ejus apud se' significat quod retinuerit ultimum verum: `usque 
venire dominum ejus ad domum suam' significat ut communicaret cum bono naturali: `et locuta ad illum secundum verba haec' significat falsiloquium: `dicendo, Venit ad me servus Hebraeus, quem adduxisti 
nobis' significat servum illud: `ad illudendum mihi' significat quod insurgeret: `et factum, sicut tollere me vocem meam, et clamavi' significat cum appercepit magnam aversationem: `et reliquit 
vestem suam apud me' significat testificationem: `et fugit foras' significat quod tunc se separaret. </p>
