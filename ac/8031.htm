<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8031节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8031.</strong>木星灵根本不愿结交我们地狱灵，因为他们有不同的倾向和习俗。他们说，我们地球灵很狡猾，在阴谋作恶上聪明灵巧，却对良善知之甚少，也很少思想它。他们还说，我们星球的灵人不像他们那样承认独一主。此外，木星灵远比我们地球灵更有智慧；论到我们地球灵，木星灵又说，他们说得多，想得少，因而无法拥有对许多事物的内在觉知，甚至没有对良善的内在觉知。他们由此推断，我们地球人是外在人。</p>

The spirits of that earth are utterly unwilling to be in fellowship with the spirits of our earth, because they differ in disposition and manners; for they say that the spirits of our earth are cunning, 
and are ingenious in plotting evils, and that they know and think little about what is good; also that they do not, as they do, acknowledge the one only Lord. Moreover, the spirits of the earth Jupiter 
are much wiser than the spirits of our earth, of whom they also say that they speak much and think little, and thus that they cannot interiorly perceive many things, and not even what good is. From 
this they conclude that the men of our earth are external men. </p>

Spirits belonging to that planet have no desire at all to mix with spirits belonging to our planet, since they have different inclinations and customs. They say that spirits belonging to our planet are 
deceitful, and are quick and clever at devising wicked deeds, having little knowledge of what is good and giving little thought to it. They also say that spirits from our planet do not acknowledge 
the one and only Lord, as they themselves do. Furthermore spirits belonging to the planet Jupiter have far more wisdom than spirits belonging to our planet, about whom they also say that they talk a lot 
but think little, and so cannot have a deep perception of many things, and certainly not of what is good. From all this they infer that people belonging to our planet are external people.  </p>

Spiritus illius telluris prorsus non volunt in consortio esse cum spiritibus nostrae telluris, quia differunt animis et moribus; dicunt enim quod spiritus nostrae telluris sint astuti, ac ad machinanda 
mala prompti (c)et ingeniosi, et quod parum sciant (c)et cogitent de bono; tum quod non sicut illi agnoscant unicum Dominum.  Praeterea spiritus telluris Jovis multo sapientiores sunt spiritibus nostrae 
telluris, de quibus etiam dicunt quod multa loquantur et parum cogitent, (c)et sic quod non multa possint interius percipere, {1}et ne quidem bonum; concludunt inde quod {2}homines nostrae telluris 
homines externi sint. 	@1 nempe num vere bonum sit vel non$ 	@2 in tellure nostra exteriores homines sint$ </p>
