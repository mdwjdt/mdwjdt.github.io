<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2520节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2520.</strong>“他说，主啊，连公义的民族你也要毁灭吗”表连教义的良善与真理也要被消灭吗？这从“民族”的含义清楚可知，“民族”是指良善（参看<a href="1259.htm">1259</a>，<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>，<a href="1416.htm">1416</a>节）。“公义的民族”指的是亚比米勒的民族，而“亚比米勒”表信之教义，故“公义的民族”在此用来表示良善与真理，因为这二者属于教义。<br />显而易见，这些话是出于伴随一种情感或对全人类之爱的热忱来说的。这爱引导主尚未脱去来自母亲的肉身时的思维。尽管主通过神性发觉，信之教义只来自属天的源头，但仍要满足人类的需要，因为若不能通过理性思维形成某种概念，人类就不接受任何事物，故经上说“连公义的民族你也要毁灭吗”，以此表示连教义的良善与真理也要被消灭吗？若不通过理性思维形成某种概念，人就不接受任何事物。这一事实从人对神性奥秘所持的观念明显看出来。这些观念总是粘附着源于世俗物体或类似世俗物体之物的某种概念，它们通过这些东西被保持在记忆中，在思维中再现。因为没有源于世俗物体的观念，人就不能进行思维。因此，来自神性源头的真理若赤裸裸地呈现出来，就永不被接受。因为它们远远超出人的理解范畴，也远远超出他的信仰，尤其那些具有外在敬拜的人。<br />以下面的例子来说明这一点：神性本身只能居于神性中，因而只能居于主的神圣人性里面，并通过祂的人性而与人同在。若请教理性，它必要说，神性本身能居于任何人的人身。再者：凡不从主，因而从为一的神性发出之物都不神圣。若请教理性，它必要说，神圣之物或许也源于其它源头。<br />还有：人凭自己不能存活，也不能行善、相信真理，甚至不能思考；他所行或所信的善与真皆来自主；而恶与假皆来自地狱；而且，地狱，也就是那些地狱里的人无法凭自己思考，而是和人类一样，只是主之善与真的接受者。若请教理性，它必拒绝所有这些观念，因为它不理解。它还会拒绝以下观念：没人会因他所行之善和所教导的真理而得到奖赏；外在并不能做什么，只有通过内在才行，就如对良善的情感存在于对良善的践行中，由此而来的对真理的情感存在于对真理的教导中，这些事不是凭人的自我做成的。这样的例子还能举出上千例。<br />正因人类理性具有这样的性质，所以圣言采用了适合人的理解力，因而适合其天性的表述。这也解释了为何圣言的内义不同于字义。这一点从旧约非常明显地看出来，旧约中的绝大多数事件都是照着生活在那些时代之人的理解力和天性来写的。鉴于此，经上几乎没有提及关于死后生命、永恒救赎和内在人的事。因为那时，拥有教会的犹太人和以色列人具有这样的性质：若将这些事披露给他们，他们不仅不理解，反而加以嘲笑。若向他们披露，弥赛亚或基督要来永远拯救他们的灵魂，情形也一样：他们也会把它当作无关紧要之事而加以拒绝，这一点也可从现在这个民族明显看出来。即便现在当着他们的面提及内在之物或属灵之物，跟他们说，弥赛亚不会是世上的大君王，他们也会加以嘲笑。<br />这就是为何主有时象先知那样讲话，并用比喻来表述其它话的原因，正如祂在马太福音中所声称的：<br />耶稣说，我用比喻对他们说话，是因为看见的人却看不见，听见的人却听不见，也不明白。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.13.htm">13:13</a>）<br />“看见的人”和“听见的人”是指那些尽管能看见、听见，却不理解的教会中人。约翰福音：<br />主叫他们瞎了眼、硬了心，免得他们眼睛看见，心里明白，回转过来，我就医治他们。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.40.htm">12:40</a>）<br />他们“回转过来”和“医治”暗示，他们后来仍会拒绝，从而亵渎，而亵渎必带来永恒的诅咒（参看<a href="301.htm">301</a>-<a href="303.htm">303</a>，<a href="582.htm">582</a>，<a href="1008.htm">1008</a>，<a href="1010.htm">1010</a>，<a href="1059.htm">1059</a>，<a href="1327.htm">1327</a>，<a href="1328.htm">1328</a>，<a href="2051.htm">2051</a>，<a href="2426.htm">2426</a>节）。主在很多地方披露了圣言的内在事物，不过仅仅是为了智者。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2520</b></p><p><b>2520.</b>
And he said, Lord, wilt Thou slay also a righteous nation? That this signifies whether would the good and truth be extinguished, is evident from the signification of "nation," as being good (see n. 1259, 
1260, 1416); and as it is predicated of the nation of Abimelech, by whom is signified the doctrine of faith, by a "righteous nation" is here signified both good and truth; for both are of doctrine. [2] 
That this was said from the zeal of affection or of love toward the whole human race, is manifest. This love directed the Lord's thoughts while He was still in the maternal human; and although 
He perceived from the Divine that the doctrine of faith was from a celestial origin only, nevertheless in order that the human race might be provided for, which does not receive anything of which it 
cannot have some idea from its rational, it is therefore said, " Wilt Thou slay also a righteous nation?" by which is signified whether would the good and truth of doctrine be extinguished. That man does 
not receive anything of which he cannot have some idea from his rational, is evident from the ideas which man cherishes respecting Divine arcana. Some idea from worldly things or from things analogous 
to these always adheres to them, by which they are retained in the memory, and by which they are reproduced in the thought; for without an idea from worldly things man can think nothing at all. If 
therefore truths from a Divine origin were set forth naked, they would never be received, but would completely transcend man's comprehension, and therefore his belief, and most especially with those 
who are in external worship. [3] To illustrate this take the following examples: The Divine Itself can be in nothing but the Divine, thus in nothing but the Lord's Divine Human, and with man through 
this. If the rational were consulted it would say that the Divine Itself can be in the human of everyone. Again: Nothing is holy which does not proceed from the Lord, thus from the Divine, which is one. 
If the rational were consulted it would say that there may be what is holy from other sources also. [4] Again: Man does not live, nor do good, nor believe truth, from himself, nay, does not even 
think from himself; but the good and truth are from the Lord, while the evil and falsity are from hell; and what is more, hell, that is, they who are in hell, do not think from themselves, but receive 
the Lord's good and truth in the manner indicated. If the rational were consulted it would reject this, because it does not comprehend it. In like manner it would reject the truth that no one is rewarded 
on account of doing what is good and teaching what is true; and that the external contributes nothing, but only the internal insofar as there is the affection of good in doing what is good, and insofar 
as there is from that the affection of truth in teaching what is true, and this not from self. And so in a thousand other instances. [5] It is because the human rational is of such a character 
that the Word has spoken in accordance with man's apprehension, and also in accordance with his genius. This therefore is the reason why the internal sense of the Word is different from its literal sense; 
which is very evident in the Word of the Old Testament, where most things have been written in accordance with the apprehension and genius of the people who then lived. On this account almost nothing 
is said concerning the life after death, salvation, and the internal man. For the Jewish and Israelitish people with whom the church then was, were of such a character that if these things had been 
disclosed they would not only not have understood them, but would also have derided them. And it would have been the same if it had been disclosed to them that the Messiah or Christ was to come to 
eternally save their souls: this also they would have rejected as a matter of no moment; as is also evident from the same nation at the present day; for if what is internal or spiritual is mentioned 
in their presence even now, and it is said that the Messiah will not be the greatest king on the earth, they deride it. [6] This is why the Lord sometimes spoke like the Prophets, and taught the rest 
of what He had to say by parables, as He Himself has declared in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Jesus said, I speak unto them by parables, because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand 
(Matt. 13:13). By "those who see and hear" are meant those within the church who although they see and hear, still do not understand. Also in John: </p>
<p>     He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened 
their heart, lest they should see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them (John 12:40). Their being "converted" and "healed" implies that 
nevertheless they would afterwards reject, and so would profane, which involves eternal condemnation (see n. 301-303, 582, 1008, 1010, 1059, 1327, 1328, 2051, 2426). Nevertheless the Lord has disclosed 
the interior things of the Word in many places, but only for the wise. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2520</b></p><p><b>2520.</b>
'And he said, Lord, will You kill even a righteous nation?' means, Would the good and truth of doctrine be done away with? This is clear from the meaning of 'ration' as good, dealt with in <a href="1259.htm">1259</a>, <a href="1260.htm">1260</a>, <a href="1416.htm">1416</a>. And because the words 'a righteous nation' refer to 'the nation of Abimelech', who means the doctrine of faith, they are used here to mean both good and truth, since both are the subject matter 
of doctrine.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that these words were uttered from a zeal that went with an affection or love towards the whole human race may be evident to anyone. Such love was directing the Lord's 
thoughts even when He had not yet put off the human from the mother. And although He perceived from the Divine that the doctrine of faith had a wholly celestial origin, nevertheless in order that the 
needs of the human race, which does not receive anything of which it cannot form some idea from its own rational thought, might be met, it is therefore said, 'Will You kill even a righteous nation?' meaning, 
Would the good and truth of doctrine be done away with? The fact that a person does not receive anything of which he cannot form some idea from his rational thought may be seen from the ideas 
which a person entertains regarding Divine arcana. The latter always have some idea attached to them that is derived from worldly objects or things analogous to worldly objects by which they are retained 
in the memory and reproduced in thought. For without ideas derived from worldly objects a person is unable to engage in thought. If therefore truths from a Divine origin were presented naked they 
would never be accepted because they would go far beyond his range of understanding, and so beyond his faith as well, most of all in the case of those whose worship is external. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Let the following 
examples illustrate this: The Divine itself cannot reside in anything except that which is Divine, and so only in the Lord's Divine Human, and with man through His Human. If the rational were consulted 
it would say that the Divine itself can reside in the human of anyone. Again nothing holy exists which does not proceed from the Lord, and so from the Divine, which is one. If the rational were consulted 
it would say that what is holy may also spring from other sources. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Again, man does not live from himself, do good from himself, believe the truth from himself, or indeed think from himself. 
The good and truth that he does or believes come from the Lord, but the evil and falsity come from hell. And what is more, hell - that is, those who are in hell - do not think from themselves but, 
in the same way as man, are recipients of the Lord's good and truth. If the rational were consulted it would reject all those ideas because it would not comprehend them. It would also reject the idea 
that nobody is rewarded on account of the good he does and of the truth he teaches. And it would reject the idea that what is external does not accomplish anything, only what is internal, insofar as 
the affection for good is present in the doing of good, and insofar as from this the affection for truth is present in the teaching of truth, and insofar as the things are not done from oneself. So 
also with a thousand other examples that could be given. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Such being the nature of the human rational, the Word therefore uses expressions that accord with man's capacity to understand, and also 
with his inherent disposition. And this explains why the internal sense of the Word is different from its literal sense. This becomes quite clear from the Old Testament Word where most things are stated 
in ways that accord with the capacity to understand and the inherent disposition of the people who lived in those times. As a consequence little, indeed scarcely anything, is mentioned there about 
the life after death, about eternal salvation, and about the internal man. Indeed the character of the Jewish and Israelitish people with whom the Church existed at that time was such that if these matters 
had been disclosed to them they would not only have failed to understand them but would also have ridiculed them. If similarly it had been disclosed to them that the Messiah or Christ was going 
to come and save their souls for ever, this too they would have rejected as something of no importance, as also becomes clear from the same nation today. And it is so still that if what is internal or 
spiritual is mentioned in their presence, and the fact that the Messiah is not going to be a very great earthly king, they laugh at it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 This was the reason why the Lord sometimes spoke in the 
way the Prophets had spoken and expressed all else by means of parables, as He Himself states in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said, I speak to them in parables, because those who see do not see, and those who hear 
do not hear, nor do they understand. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13: 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Those who see' and 'those who hear' are those inside the Church who, though they see and hear, nevertheless do not understand. And in John, </p>
<blockquote>
He 
has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, lest they see with their eyes and understand with their heart, and are converted and I heal them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2012:-40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 12:-40</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Their being 'converted' and being 
'healed' implies that even so they would subsequently reject and in so doing profane, which entails eternal condemnation, see <a href="301.htm">301</a>-<a href="303.htm">303</a>, <a href="582.htm">582</a>, <a href="1008.htm">1008</a>, <a href="1010.htm">1010</a>, <a href="1059.htm">1059</a>, <a href="1327.htm">1327</a>, <a href="1328.htm">1328</a>, <a href="2051.htm">2051</a>, <a href="2426.htm">2426</a>. Nevertheless the 
Lord in many places disclosed the interior things of the Word, but solely for the benefit of the wise. </p>

</p><b>2520.</b>
`Et dixit, Domine, num gentem etiam justam occides? quod significet num bonum et verum doctrinae exstingueretur, constat a significatione `gentis' quod sit bonum, de qua n. 1259, 1260, 1416; et quia 
praedicatur de `gente Abimelechi,' per quem significantur doctrina fidei, per `gentem justam' hic intelligitur tam bonum quam verum, utramque enim est doctrinae. [2] Quod haec dicta sint ex zelo affectionis 
seu amoris erga universum genus humanum, patet; amor ille cogitationes Domini, cum adhuc in humano materno fuit, dirigebat; et tametsi percipiebat ex Divino quod doctrina fidei non nisi {1} e 
origine caelesti sit, usque tamen ut consuleretur generi humano, quod non recipit aliquid cujus non aliquam ideam ex rationali suo habere potest, ideo dictum, `Num gentem etiam justam occides?' quo significatur, 
Num bonum et verum doctrinae exstingueretur? Quod homo non recipiat aliquid cujus non aliquam ideam ex rationali si habere potest, constare potest ab ideis quas homo fovet de arcanis Divinis; 
semper iis {2} aliqua idea ex mundanis aut analogis mundanorum adhaeret, per quam retinetur in memoria, et per quam reproducitur in cogitationem, nam homo absque idea ex mundanis nihil usquam cogitare 
potest; ideo si vera nude {3} ex Divina origine proponerentur, nusquam reciperentur, sed {4} excederent omnem ejus captum, ita quoque fidem, maxime eorum qui in externo cultu sunt: [3] haec ut illustrentur, 
sint haec exempla {5}: Ipsum Divinum non potest esse nisi in Divino, ita non nisi quam in Divino Humano Domini, et per hoc apud hominem; rationale si consuleretur, diceret quod Ipsum Divinum 
possit esse in humano cujusvis: adhuc, quod non sit aliquod sanctum quod non procedit a Domino, ita a Divino quod unum; rationale si consuleretur, diceret quod etiam aliunde: [4] adhuc, quod homo non 
vivat ex se, non bonum faciat ex se, non {6} verum credat ex se, immo non cogitet ex se, (m)sed bonum et verum ex Domino, malum autem et falsum ab {7} inferno; et quod magis, infernum {8}, (o)hoc est, 
qui in inferno, nec cogitant a se, sed recipiunt ita bonum et verum Domini;(n) rationale si consuleretur, haec rejiceret quia non caperet: tum quod nullus remuneretur propter quod faciat bonum et 
doceat verum, et quod externum nihil faciat sed internum, quantum affectionis boni sit in facere bonum et quantum inde affectionis veri in docere verum, et hoc quantum non ex se: ita in mille aliis.  
[5] Quia rationale humanum tale est, ideo locutum est in Verbo secundum hominis captum, etiam secundum genium; ideo {9} est quod alius sit sensus Verbi internus quam est ejus litteralis; quod satis constare 
potest a Verbo Veteris Testamenti, ubi pleraque dicta sunt secundum captum et genium populi qui tunc vivebat; idcirco tam pauca ut vix aliqua, de vita post mortem, de salute aeterna, deque interno 
homine; talis enim erat populis Judaicus et Israeliticus, apud quem tunc Ecclesia, ut si illa detegerentur, non solum non intelligerent, sed etiam subsannarent; similiter si iis detectum fuisset quod 
Messias seu Christus venturus ad salvandum animas eorum in aeternum, hoc quoque ut nullum rejecissent, sicut etiam ab eadem gente constare potest hodie, coram qua si adhuc nominatur internum aut spirituale, 
ac Messias quod non rex erit maximus in terra, irridetur; haec causa fuit quod Dominus similiter ac Prophetae passim locutus sit, et cetera per parabolas, ut Ipse dicit apud Matthaeum, 	Jesus 
dixit, Per parabolas loquor illis, quia videntes non rident, et audientes non audiunt, nec intelligunt, xiii 13; </p>
<p>`videntes et audientes' sunt ii qui intra Ecclesiam, qui tametsi vident et audiunt, 
usque non intelligunt: et apud Johannem, 	Occaecavit (c)eorum oculos, et obturavit eorum cor, ut non videant oculis suis, et intelligant corde, et convertant se, `et sanem illos, xii 40; </p>
<p>quod `se 
converterent et sanarentur' involvit quod usque dein rejicerent, et sic profanarent, quod secum habet damnationem aeternam, videatur n. 301-303, 582, 1008, 1010, 1059, 1327, 1328, 2051, 2426; sed usque
