<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1085.</strong>“搭在两人的肩上”表他们竭尽全力这样做，也就是说，他们对此作善意的解释，并原谅它。这一点从“肩”表全力的含义清楚可知。在圣言中，“手”表力量，如前所述。“臂”表更大的力量，而“肩”则表全力，这也可从以下圣言经文清楚看出来，以西结书：<br />因为你们用胁用肩拥挤一切瘦弱的羊，又用角骶触，以致使他们四散。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结34.21.htm">34:21</a>）<br />“用胁用肩”在此表他们的一切灵魂和一切力量；“用角骶触”表他们的全部力气。<br />同一先知书：<br />埃及一切的居民，因向以色列家成了芦苇的杖，就知道我是耶和华。他们用手持住你，你就断折，伤了他们的肩。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结29.6.htm">29:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结29.7.htm">7</a>）<br />这论及那些想通过记忆的知识探究属灵真理的人。“芦苇的杖”表这类力量，“用手”表信靠它，“伤了肩”表丧失一切力量，以致他们什么也不知道。西番雅书：<br />万民好求告耶和华的名，并肩来事奉他。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番3.9.htm">3:9</a>）<br />“并肩”表同心协力这样做。<br />撒迦利亚书：<br />他们却不肯听从，扭转肩头。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚7.11.htm">7:11</a>）<br />这表他们竭尽全力抗拒。以赛亚书：<br />他们雇银匠用金银制造神像。他们又俯伏又叩拜。他们将神像抬起，扛在肩上。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛46.6.htm">46:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛46.7.htm">7</a>）<br />“肩”表他们全力崇拜偶像，“扛在肩上”表全力。<br />同一先知书：<br />因有一婴孩为我们而生，有一子赐给我们，政权必担在祂的肩头上，祂名称为奇妙，策士，全能的神，英雄，永在的父，和平的君。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.6.htm">9:6</a>）<br />这论及主，在此论及祂所拥有和行使的权力和大能，因此经上说“担在祂的肩头上”。<br />我必将大卫家的钥匙放在祂肩头上，祂开，无人能关；祂关，无人能开。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛22.22.htm">22:22</a>）<br />这同样论及主，“将大卫家的钥匙放在祂肩头上”表祂所拥有和行使的权力。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1085.</strong> The fact that they put it on their shoulder means that they did so — that is, put a good interpretation on the situation and excused it — with all their might can be seen from the symbolism of the shoulder as all a person's might. In the Word, a hand symbolizes power (demonstrated before [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1085/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_878" target=_top>878</a>]) and an arm symbolizes even greater power, but a shoulder symbolizes all power. This symbolism can also be seen in the following places in the Word. In Ezekiel:<br />With side and shoulder you push, and with your horns you strike all the ailing sheep until you scatter them outside. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1085/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_34_21" target=_top>Ezekiel 34:21</a>)<br /> [To push] with side and shoulder stands for doing so with all one's soul and all one's might, while striking with the horns stands for doing so with all one's strength.<br />[2] In the same author:<br />... so that all the inhabitants of Egypt will recognize that I am Jehovah, because these have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.{*1} When they seize you by the palm, you will be shattered to pieces and split every shoulder of theirs. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1085/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_29_6-7" target=_top>Ezekiel 29:6-7</a>)<br />This describes people who want to use facts to investigate spiritual truth. The staff of reed stands for the power to do so; seizing by the palm stands for being confident; and splitting every shoulder stands for being stripped of all power, so that they know nothing.<br />[3] In Zephaniah:<br />... so that they may all call on the name of Jehovah, so that they may serve him with a single shoulder. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1085/bible_king-james-version_zephaniah_3_9" target=_top>Zephaniah 3:9</a>)<br />This stands for doing so with one soul and consequently with united power. In Zechariah:<br />They refused to heed and turned a defiant shoulder. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1085/bible_king-james-version_zechariah_7_11" target=_top>Zechariah 7:11</a>)<br />This stands for the fact that they resisted with all their might. In Isaiah:<br />They hire a metalsmith, who makes gold and silver into a god. They worship; they also bow down; they bear it on their shoulder; they carry it about. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1085/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_46_6-7" target=_top>Isaiah 46:6-7</a>)<br />This stands for the fact that they worship the idol with all their might — which is to carry it on their shoulder.<br />[4] In the same author:<br />A child has been born for us, a son has been given to us, and sovereignty will be on his shoulder; and his name will be called Miraculous, Counselor, God, Hero, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1085/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_9_6" target=_top>Isaiah 9:6</a>)<br />This speaks of the Lord, and here specifically of his power and authority, which is why it says, "on his shoulder." In the same author:<br />I will put the key of David's house on his shoulder, and he will open, and there will be no one closing; and he will close, and there will be no one opening. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1085/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_22_22" target=_top>Isaiah 22:22</a>)<br />This verse likewise treats of the Lord. Putting the key of David's house on his shoulder stands for his power and authority.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} A staff of reed would be very weak; Egypt, in other words, has been an unreliable support to Israel. This passage is addressed to Egypt, so "you" in the next clauses refers to Egypt and "they" to Israel. [LHC] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1085</b></p><p><b>1085.</b>
And laid it upon the shoulder. That this signifies that they did this-that is, interpreted for good and excused-with all their might, is evident from the signification of "shoulder" as being all power. 
"Hand" in the Word signifies power, as shown before; "arm" signifies still greater power; and "shoulder" signifies all power, as is evident from the following passages in the Word, in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>   
  Ye thrust with side and with shoulder, and push all the diseased sheep with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad (Ezek. 34:21). "With side and with shoulder" means with all the soul and all 
the might, and "pushing with their horns" means with all the strength. [2] Again: </p>
<p>     That all the inhabitants of Egypt may know that I am Jehovah, because they have been a staff of reed to the house 
of Israel; in their taking hold of thee in the hand thou shalt be broken, and shall rend for them every shoulder (Ezek. 29:6-7). This is said of those who desire to explore spiritual truths by means 
of memory-knowledges [scientifica]. The "staff of reed" denotes such power; "taking in the hand" means trusting therein; "rending every shoulder" means being deprived of all power so as to know nothing. 
 [3] In Zephaniah: </p>
<p>     That they may all call upon the name of Jehovah, to serve Him with one shoulder (Zeph. 3:9); </p>
<p>meaning with one soul, thus with one might. In Zechariah:       But they 
refused to hearken, and turned a stubborn shoulder (Zech. 7:11); </p>
<p>meaning that they resisted with all their might. In Isaiah: They hire a goldsmith, who maketh gold and silver into a god; they adore, 
yea, they bow down; they bear it upon the shoulder, they carry it (Isa. 46:6-7); </p>
<p>meaning that they adore their idol with all their might, which is "bearing it on the shoulder."  [4] Again: </p>
<p>     For 
unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given; and the government shall be upon His shoulder: and His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, God, Hero, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace (Isa. 
9:6).This is said of the Lord, and of His power and might; and therefore it is said, "upon His shoulder." Again: </p>
<p>     The key of the house of David will I lay upon His shoulder; and He shall open, 
and none shall shut; and He shall shut and none shall open (Isa. 22:22). This likewise is said of the Lord, and "to lay upon His shoulder the key of the house of David" means His power and authority. </p>

'They put it on a shoulder' means that they did so with all the power they had, that is to say, they placed a good interpretation on it and excused it. This is clear from the meaning of 'shoulder' as 
all power. In the Word 'hand' means power, as shown already. 'Arm' means greater power still, while 'shoulder' means all power, as becomes clear also from the following places in the Word: In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
You 
push with side and with shoulder, and butt with your horns all the weak sheep till you have scattered them abroad. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2034:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 34:21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'With side and with shoulder' here stands for all their soul 
and all their power; and 'butting with horns' stands for all their strength.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
That all the inhabitants of Egypt may know that I am Jehovah, because they have been a staff 
of reed to the house of Israel. When they grasp you with the hand you will be broken, and will tear for them every shoulder. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2029:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 29:6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to people who wish to probe into spiritual 
truths by means of facts. 'A staff of reed' stands for power of this kind, 'taking with the hand' stands for trusting in it, 'tearing every shoulder' for being deprived of all power so that they may 
know nothing. In Zephaniah, </p>
<blockquote>
That all of them may call on the name of Jehovah to serve Him with one shoulder. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zeph%203:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zeph 3:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'One shoulder' stands for doing so with one soul. and so with one power. 
 </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
They refused to listen, and turned a stubborn shoulder. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%207:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 7:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This stands for their resisting with all the power they had. In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
They hire a smith who makes gold 
and silver into God. They worship, they even bow down to it. They bear it on the shoulder, they carry it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2046:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 46:6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Shoulder' stands for their worshipping the idol with all the power they 
have, which is 'bearing on the shoulder'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
To us a Boy is born, to us a Son is given; and the government will be upon His shoulder, and His name will be called, Wonderful, 
Counsellor, God, Hero, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%209:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 9:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord, and at this point to the power He has and exercises - hence the phrase 'upon His shoulder'. In the same 
prophet,  </p>
<p>I will place the key of the house of David on His shoulder, and He will open and none will shut; and He will shut and none will open. </p>
<p>This similarly refers to the Lord, placing on 
the shoulder the key of the house of David' standing for the power He has and exercises. </p>

Quod 'posuerunt super humero' significet quod illud omni potentia, nempe in bonum interpretati et excusaverint, constat a significatione 'humeri' quod sit omnis potentia; 'manus' in Verbo significat 
potentiam, quod prius ostensum; 'brachium' potentiam adhuc majorem; 'humerus' autem omnem potentiam, quod etiam constare potest ab his in Verbo locis; apud Ezechielem, 	Latere et humero impellitis,

<p>'latere et humero' hic pro omni anima et omni potentia; et 'cornibus ferire' pro omnibus viribus: [2]

humerum, xxix 6, 7; </p>
<p>de illis qui ex scientificis volunt explorare veritates spirituales; 'baculus arundinis' pro potentia tali, 'prehendere vola' pro confidere, 'findere omnem humerum' pro privari

<p>pro quod omni potentia contranisi sint: apud Esaiam, 	Conducunt conflatorem, qui facit aurum et argentum in Deum, adorant, etiam se incurvant, portant 
illud super 	humero, gestant illud, xlvi 6, 7; </p>
<p>pro quod omni potentia adorent idolum, quod est 'portare humero': [4] apud eundem, 	Puer natus est nobis, Filius datus est nobis, et erit principatus

'super cujus humero': apud eundem, 	Dabo clavem domus Davidis super humerum Ipsius, et 	aperiet et non claudens, et claudet et non aperiens, xxii 	22; </p>
<p>ibi similiter de Domino, et 'super humerum dare
