<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2574节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2574.</strong>“又对撒拉说”表来自属灵真理的直觉。这从“妻子撒拉”和“妹子撒拉”的代表性，以及“说”的含义清楚可知：“妻子撒拉”是指神性属灵真理（参看<a href="2507.htm">2507</a>节），“妹子撒拉”是指理性真理（参看<a href="2508.htm">2508</a>节）；“说”是指发觉（参看<a href="2506.htm">2506</a>节）。此处被说话的撒拉既是妻子，也是妹子。之所以是妻子，是因为她已被归还（<a href="2569.htm">2569</a>节）；之所以是妹子，是因为经上说：“我给你哥哥一千锭银子”。而且，撒拉以妻子的身份来理解亚比米勒所说的话，故“对撒拉说”表通过属灵真理发觉。<br />显然，这些话包含更深层次的奥秘，无法理性阐明。若要在某种程度上阐明它们，有必要先解释很多尚不为人知的事。例如：何为属灵真理；何为来自属灵真理的直觉；唯独主拥有来自属灵真理的直觉；正如主将理性真理植入理性良善，主也将属灵真理植入属天良善，从而不断将人性植入神性，以便一切事物中都有人性与神性，并神性与人性的婚姻。在理性展开本节所包含的这些事之前，必须先解释这些及其它许多事。这些事主要适合天使的心智，他们能理解这类事，圣言的内义就是为他们而存在的。对他们来说，这些事是以天上的方式来代表的；通过这些事和本章所包含的事，有两个观念被注入进来：一是，主如何逐渐抛弃祂从母亲得来的人身，直到最后不再是她的儿子（主并不承认玛利亚是祂的母亲，这一事实明显可见于马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.46.htm">12:46</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.49.htm">49</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可3.31.htm">3:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可3.35.htm">35</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.20.htm">8:20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.21.htm">21</a>；约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约2.4.htm">2:4</a>）；二是，主如何凭自己的力量将人性变成神性，直到祂与父为一，如祂自己在约翰福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.6.htm">14:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.8.htm">8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.11.htm">11</a>等）中所教导的。主在清晰的光中通过无数难以描述的观念和代表物将这类事呈现给天使。如前所述，原因在于，这类事适合天使的心智，当意识到它们时，天使便体验到聪明的极乐和智慧的幸福。此外，有些天使在世为人时，对主的人身所形成的观念，和对其他人的人身所形成的观念一样。为了让这些天使在来世能与属天天使在一起（因为在来世，对良善的情感所激发的观念将人们联结在一起），诸如他们对主曾持有的错误观念会通过内义被驱散，他们以这种方式得以完善。这表明，包含在圣言内义中的那些对天使来说何等宝贵。尽管在世人看来，它们或许显得微不足道，因为世人对这类事的概念如此模糊，以至于几乎没有任何概念。</p>

And unto Sarah he said. That this signifies perception from spiritual truth, is evident from the representation of "Sarah a wife," as being Divine spiritual truth (see n. 2507), and of the same as a 
"sister," as being rational truth (see n. 2508); and from the signification of "saying," as being to perceive (see n. 2506). Sarah is here addressed as a wife, and also as a sister; as a wife, inasmuch 
as she had been restored (n. 2569), and as a sister, inasmuch as it is said, "I have given thy brother a thousand of silver;" and that which was said by Abimelech was perceived by Sarah in the former 
relation; therefore by "saying to Sarah" is signified to perceive from spiritual truth. [2] It is evident that these things involve deeper arcana than can be set forth to the apprehension; and even 
if they were set forth merely to some extent, it would be necessary to explain many things first that are as yet unknown; such as what spiritual truth is, and what perception from spiritual truth is; 
that the Lord alone had perception from spiritual truth; that as the Lord had implanted rational truth in rational good, so had He implanted spiritual truth in celestial good, thus continually the Human 
in the Divine, so that there might be in everything a marriage of the Human with the Divine, and of the Divine with the Human. These and many more things must come first, before the things in this 
verse can be unfolded to the apprehension. These things are chiefly adapted to the minds of angels who are in the understanding of such things, and for whom is the internal sense of the Word. To them 
these things are represented in a heavenly manner, and thereby, and by the things contained in this chapter, it is insinuated how the Lord by degrees cast out the human from the mother, until at last 
He was no longer her son (that He did not acknowledge her as His mother, is manifest in Matthew 12:46-49; Mark 3:31-35; Luke 8:20, 21; John 2:4); also how He made the Human Divine by His own power, even 
until He was one with the Father, as He Himself teaches in John 14:6, 8-11, and elsewhere. [3] These things are presented by the Lord to the angels in clear light by means of myriads of ideas and 
representations, all ineffable. The reason as before said is that such things are adapted to their minds, and when in them they are in the blessedness of their intelligence and the happiness of their 
wisdom. Moreover as there are angels who when they were men had conceived an idea of the Lord's Human as of the human with another man, in order that in the other life these may be able to be with the 
celestial angels (for there ideas inspired by the affection of good conjoin), such things are dispersed by means of the spiritual sense of the Word, and in this way they are perfected. This shows how 
precious to the angels is that which is contained in the internal sense of the Word, although perchance it may appear as but of little consequence to man, who has so obscure an idea about such things 
that it is scarcely any idea at all. </p>

'And to Sarah he said' means perception from spiritual truth. This is clear from the representation of 'Sarah when a wife' as Divine spiritual truth, dealt with in <a href="2507.htm">2507</a>, and of the same character when 
'a sister' as rational truth, dealt with in <a href="2508.htm">2508</a>, and from the meaning of 'saying' as perceiving, dealt with in <a href="2506.htm">2506</a>. Here Sarah is addressed as 'a wife' and also as 'a sister' _ as 'a wife' because 
she had been restored [to Abraham], <a href="2569.htm">2569</a>, as 'a sister' because it is said, 'I have given a thousand pieces of silver to your brother'. Also, in that what was said by Abimelech was perceived by Sarah 
in her wifely status, therefore 'saying to Sarah' means perceiving from spiritual truth. </p>

 These words, it is evident, embody deeper arcana than can be disclosed intelligibly. And if they were to 
be disclosed merely to a limited extent it would be necessary to explain many things first of all, which are as yet unknown, such as what spiritual truth is; what perception from spiritual truth is; 
the fact that the Lord alone has had perception from spiritual truth; the fact that just as the Lord implanted rational truth within rational good so He implanted spiritual truth within celestial good, 
and in so doing was constantly implanting the Human within the Divine in order that in every thing the marriage might exist of the Human with the Divine, and of the Divine with the Human. These things 
and many more must come first before the things within this verse can be presented intelligibly. Those things are primarily suited to the minds of angels which have the ability to understand them 
and for the sake of which minds the internal sense of the Word exists. To them these matters are represented in a heavenly manner; and by means of those matters and of the things within this chapter, 
an idea is instilled of how the Lord by degrees cast aside the human which He had from the mother until at length He was no longer her son (the fact that He did not acknowledge her as His mother is evident 
in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2012:%2046-49&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 12: 46-49</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%203:%2031-35&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 3: 31-35</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%208:%2020,%2021&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 8: 20, 21</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%202:%204)&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 2: 4)</a> and also an idea of how by His own power He made the Human Divine until He was one with the Father, as He Himself teaches in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:%206,%208-11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14: 6, 8-11</a>, and elsewhere. </p>

 By means of myriads of ideas and representations, all of which are beyond description, the Lord presents such matters to angels in clear light. The reason, as has been 
stated, is that these are suited to their minds, and when conscious of them they experience the bliss of intelligence and the happiness of wisdom. What is more, there are angels who, while they were 
men, formed ideas of the Lord's Human as they did of that of any other person. In order that these angels may exist together with celestial angels in the next life - for in that life ideas inspired by 
an affection for good join people together - such erroneous ideas as they have had about the Lord are dispelled by means of the internal sense, and in this way they are perfected. This shows how precious 
to angels those things are within the internal sense of the Word, though they may perhaps seem of small importance to man whose idea of such things is so obscure as to be scarcely any idea at all. </p>

`Et Sarae dixit': quod significet perceptionem ex vero spirituali, constat ex repraesentatione `Sarae ut uxoris' quod sit verum	spirituale Divinum, de qua n. 2507, et ejusdem ut sororis quod verum rationale, 
de qua n. 2508, et a significatione `dicere' quod percipere, de qua n. 2506: hic dictum `Sarae ut uxori,' tum ut `sorori,' ut uxori quia restituta est, n. 2569, ut sorori quia dicitur `dedi 
mille argenti fratri tuo'; et quod dictum ab Abimelecho, hoc perceptum a Sarah in illo statu, ideo per `dicere Sarae' significatur percipere ex vero spirituali. [2] Haec quod arcaniora involvant quam 
ad captum possint exponi, patet; quae si aliqualiter modo exponerentur, necessum erit ut plura prius explicentur quae adhuc ignorantur; ut quid verum spirituale, quid perceptio ex vero spirituali, quod 
perceptio ex vero spirituali fuerit soli Domino, quod Dominus, sicut verum rationale implantavit bono rationali, ita verum spirituale bono caelesti, ita continue Humanum Divino, ut in singulis esset 
conjugium Humani cum Divino, ac Divini cum Humano; haec et plura praecedent antequam ad captum explicari possint illa quae in hoc versu; sunt haec imprimis adaequata mentibus angelicis, quae in intelligentia 
talium sunt, pro quibus sensus internus Verbi; illis haec repraesentantur caelesti modo, et per haec, et per illa quae in hoc capite, insinuatur quomodo Dominus humanum quod a matre, per gradus 
ejecerit, usque tandem ut ejus filius non esset amplius; quod pro matre nec agnoverit, patet apud Matth. xii 46-49; Marc. iii 31-35; Luc. viii 20, 21; Joh. ii 4; et quomodo Humanum ex propria potentia 
fecerit Divinum, usque ut unus esset cum Patre, ut Ipse docet apud Joh. xiv 6, 8-11, et alibi; [3] haec per myriades idearum et repraesentationum, omnium ineffabilium, sistuntur a Domino angelis in 
clara luce; causa est quod mentibus eorum, ut dictum, adaequata sint, ac quod in beatitudine intelligentiae et felicitate sapientiae suae sint, cum in his; et praeterea quia sunt angeli, qui dum homines 
fuerunt, ceperunt ideam de Humano Domini sicut de humano apud alium hominem, ut ii cum angelis caelestibus in altera vita simul esse possint, (ideae enim inspiratae affectione boni conjungunt in 
altera vita), talia per sensum internum Verbi discutiuntur, et sic perficiuntur: inde constare potest quam pretiosa sunt angelis, quae in sensu interno Verbi, tametsi fortassis ut levia apparitura homini, 
qui in tam obscura idea est de similibus ut vix aliqua. </p>
