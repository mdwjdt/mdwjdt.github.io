<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6557节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6557.</strong>“约瑟的哥哥们见他们父亲死了”表疏远真理与良善的事物，以及对教会已经复活的一种觉知。这从“见”和“死了”的含义，以及雅各的儿子们和以色列的代表清楚可知：“见”是指理解并觉知（参看<a href="2150.htm">2150</a>，<a href="2325.htm">2325</a>，<a href="2807.htm">2807</a>，<a href="3764.htm">3764</a>，<a href="3863.htm">3863</a>，<a href="4403.htm">4403</a>-<a href="4421.htm">4421</a>，<a href="4567.htm">4567</a>，<a href="4723.htm">4723</a>，<a href="5400.htm">5400</a>节）；雅各的儿子们，即此处的“哥哥们”，是指疏远真理与良善的事物，因为当想要杀害并卖掉约瑟时，他们就代表疏远真理与良善的事物，此处所表示的，就是这种状态，这一点从他们的话，即“或者约瑟怀恨我们，照着我们从前待他一切的恶，足足地报复我们”明显看出来，正因如此，这时他们代表对立物；“死了”是指复活，也就是教会的复活（<a href="3236.htm">3236</a>，<a href="3498.htm">3498</a>，<a href="3505.htm">3505</a>，<a href="4618.htm">4618</a>，<a href="4621.htm">4621</a>，<a href="6036.htm">6036</a>，<a href="6221.htm">6221</a>节）；以色列，即此处的“父亲”，是指教会（参看<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>，<a href="6426.htm">6426</a>节）。由此明显可知，“约瑟的哥哥们见他们父亲死了”表示疏远真理与良善的事物对教会已经复活的一种觉知。</p>

And Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead. That this signifies the things alienated from truth and good, and a perception that the church was resuscitated, is evident from the signification 
of "seeing," as being to understand and perceive (see n. 2150, 2325, 2807, 3764, 3863, 4403-4421, 4567, 4723, 5400); from the representation of the sons of Jacob, who are here the "brethren," as being 
things alienated from truth and good (for when they desired to kill Joseph, and sold him, they represented things alienated from truth and good, which state is here signified, as is plain from their 
words, "Peradventure Joseph will hate us, and returning will return unto us all the evil that we rendered to him," and it is from this that they had then represented what is opposite); from the signification 
of "being dead," as being to be resuscitated, that is, the church (n. 3236, 3498, 3505, 4618, 4621, 6036, 6221); and from the representation of Israel, who is here the "father," as being the 
church (see n. 4286, 6426). Hence it is evident that by the "brethren of Joseph saw that their father was dead," is signified a perception by things alienated from truth and good that the church was 
resuscitated. </p>

'And Joseph's brothers saw that their father had died' means the things which had become alienated from truth and good, and a discernment that the Church had been restored to life. This is clear from 
the meaning of 'seeing' as understanding and discerning, dealt with in <a href="2150.htm">2150</a>, <a href="2325.htm">2325</a>, <a href="2807.htm">2807</a>, <a href="3764.htm">3764</a>, <a href="3863.htm">3863</a>, <a href="4403.htm">4403</a>-<a href="4421.htm">4421</a>, <a href="4567.htm">4567</a>, <a href="4723.htm">4723</a>, <a href="5400.htm">5400</a>; from the representation of the sons of Jacob, to whom 'Joseph's brothers' 
refers here, as the things which had become alienated from truth and good (for when they wanted to kill Joseph but sold him, they represented things alienated from truth and good; and the fact that 
this state is meant here is evident from the words they now use, 'They said, perhaps Joseph will hate us and will fully return to us all the evil with which we repaid him', so that they had a contrary 
representation at that point); from the meaning of 'having died' as having been restored to life - referring in this instance to the Church - dealt with in <a href="3326.htm">3326</a>, <a href="3498.htm">3498</a>, <a href="3505.htm">3505</a>, <a href="4618.htm">4618</a>, <a href="4621.htm">4621</a>, <a href="6036.htm">6036</a>, <a href="6221.htm">6221</a>; 
and from the representation of Israel, to whom 'father' refers here, as the Church, dealt with in <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>, <a href="6426.htm">6426</a>. From all this it is evident that 'Joseph's brothers saw that their father had died' means 
a discernment by the things which had become alienated from truth and good that the Church had been restored to life. </p>

`Et viderunt fratres Josephi, quod mortuus pater illorum': quod significet abalienata a vero et bono, et apperceptionem quod exsuscitata Ecclesia, constat ex significatione `videre' quod sit intelligere 
et appercipere, de qua n. 2150, 2325, 2807, 3764, 3863, 4403-4421, 4567, 4723, 5400; ex repraesentatione `filiorum Jacobi' qui hic `fratres {1}', quod sint abalienata a vero et bono; cum enim occidere
