<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5489节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5489.</strong>“各在各人的口袋里”表属世层中凡有容器的地方。这从“口袋”的含义清楚可知，“口袋”是指一个容器，如下文所述；这容器之所以存在于属世层中，是因为所论述的主题是属世层中的真理和记忆知识。此处“口袋”尤表记忆知识，因为正如口袋是盛五谷的容器，记忆知识同样是良善的容器，在此是指由真理所产生的良善的容器，如前所述（<a href="5487.htm">5487</a>节）。很少有人知道记忆知识是良善的容器，因为很少有人反思这类事。然而，他们从以下考虑是能知道这一点的：进入记忆的记忆知识总是通过某种情感被引入；非通过某种情感被引入的记忆知识不会留在那里，而是会溜走。原因在于，情感里面有生命，但记忆知识若非通过情感，是没有生命可言的。由此明显可知，记忆知识始终与诸如属于情感，或也可说属于爱的那类事物，因而与某种良善联结在一起，因为属于爱的每一个事物都被称为良善，无论它是真良善，还是被误以为是良善的东西。因此，记忆知识连同这些良善可以说构成一种婚姻。正因如此，当这良善被激发时，与它联结的记忆知识也立刻被激发出来；反之，当记忆知识被忆起时，与它联结的良善也会出现。若乐意，谁都能在自己里面测试这一点。<br />由此可以得出这一结论：在抛弃仁之良善的未重生的人当中，作为教会真理存在的记忆知识拥有依附在他们身上的诸如属于爱自己爱世界的那类事物，因而有邪恶的形式；这些邪恶形式由于自己里面所含有的快乐而被未重生之人称为良善，还被他们利用错解而表现为良善。当自我之爱与尘世之爱普遍掌权时，这些记忆知识就披上诱人的外表，并照着它们掌权的程度而披上这种外表。但在已重生的人当中，作为教会真理存在的记忆知识拥有依附在他们身上的诸如属于对邻之爱和对神之爱的那类事物，因而拥有纯正的良善形式。这些良善形式被主储存在与所有正在重生之人同在的教会真理中。因此，当主将对良善的热情注入这些人时，这些真理同时以自己的适当次序显现；当主注入对真理的热情时，这良善就会同在，并点燃它。由此可见记忆知识和真理是何情形，即：它们是良善的容器。</p>

Into his sack. That this signifies wherever there was a receptacle in the natural, is evident from the signification of a "sack," as being a receptacle (of which in what follows); that it is in the natural, 
is because the subject treated of is the truths and memory-knowledges that are in the natural. Here a "sack" specifically signifies memory-knowledge, for the reason that as a sack is a receptacle 
of corn, so memory-knowledge is a receptacle of good, here of the good that is from truth (as above, n. 5487). Few know that memory-knowledge is a receptacle of good, because few reflect upon such 
things, and yet this may be known from the following considerations. The memory-knowledges that enter into the memory are always introduced by means of some affection; those not introduced by any affection 
do not stick there, but slip away. The reason of this is that in affection there is life, but not in memory-knowledges except through affection. From this it is plain that memory-knowledges always 
have conjoined with them such things as are of affection, or what is the same, as are of some love, consequently some good, for everything that is of love is called good, whether it be good or thought 
to be so. Memory-knowledges therefore together with these goods form as it were a marriage, and hence it is that when this good is excited, the memory-knowledge with which it is conjoined is also 
at once excited; and conversely, when the memory-knowledge is recalled, the good conjoined with it also comes forth, as everyone can put to the test in himself if he chooses.  [2] This then is the reason 
why with the unregenerate, who have rejected the good of charity, the memory-knowledges which are truths of the church, have adjoined to them such things as are of the love of self and of the world, 
thus evil things, which by reason of the delight that is in them they call good, and also by wrong interpretations make out to be good. These memory-knowledges make a fair show when the loves in 
question reign universally, and according to the degree in which they reign. But with the regenerate the memory-knowledges which are truths of the church have joined with them such things as are of love 
toward the neighbor and love to God, thus genuine good things. These are stored up by the Lord in the truths of the church with all who are being regenerated; and therefore when the Lord instills into 
such persons a zeal for good, these truths show themselves in their order; and when He instills a zeal for truth, this good is present and enkindles it. From all this it is evident how the case is 
with memory-knowledges and with truths-that they are receptacles of good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5489</b></p><p><b>5489.</b>
'Each man's in his own sack' means wherever a receptacle exists in the natural. This is clear from the meaning of 'a sack' as a receptacle, dealt with below; and this exists in the natural because truths 
and factual knowledge in the natural are the subject. The reason a sack' has the specific meaning here of factual knowledge is that just as a sack is a receptacle for grain, so is factual knowledge 
a receptacle for good, in this case for good that is the product of truth, as above in <a href="5487.htm">5487</a>. Few people know that factual knowledge is a receptacle for good because few stop to reflect on such matters. 
Yet they can know it from the following considerations: When facts enter the memory some affection is always instrumental in their introduction there. Facts that are not introduced by means of some 
affection do not remain but slip away. The reason for this is that life is present within an affection but not within factual knowledge except through an affection. From this it is evident that linked 
to factual knowledge there are always those kinds of impulses that belong to an affection, or what amounts to the same, that are the expressions of some love or other. Consequently it has some form 
of good linked to it, for every expression of love is called a form of good, whether it is real good or what is mistakenly thought to be such. Factual knowledge together with such forms of good therefore 
constitute a kind of marriage. This being so, when that good is stimulated, so instantly is the factual knowledge to which it is linked; and conversely, when facts are called to mind, the good to 
which they are linked comes forth. Anyone can learn of this, if he so pleases, from what goes on within himself. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 From this one may now conclude that, among unregenerate persons who have cast 
aside the good of charity, facts existing as truths known to the Church have the kinds of impulses expressing self-love and love of the world attached to them. Thus attached to those facts there are forms 
of evil which, because of the delight these hold within them, are called forms of good by those unregenerate persons, who also employ wrong interpretations to present them as such. Those facts take 
on an attractive appearance, when self-love and love of the world reign throughout, assuming it in the degree in which these are reigning. But among regenerate persons facts existing as truths known 
to the Church have the kinds of impulses that belong to love towards the neighbour and love to God, thus forms of genuine good, attached to them. These forms of good are placed by the Lord within the 
truths known to the Church that are present with all undergoing regeneration. Therefore when the Lord inspires these people with a zeal for what is good, those truths come forth at the same time in 
their own proper order; and when He inspires a zeal for truth, that good is present and sets it ablaze. From all this one may see the situation so far as factual knowledge and truths are concerned - that 
they are the receptacles for good. </p>

`Cujuslibet in saccum {1}suum': quod significet ubicumque receptaculum in naturali, constat ex significatione `sacci' quod sit receptaculum, de qua sequitur; quod in naturali, est quia de veris ac scientificis 
quae in naturali agitur. `Saccus' hic in specie significat scientificum, ex causa quia sicut saccus est receptaculum frumenti, ita scientificum est receptaculum boni, hic boni quod a vero, 
ut supra n. (x)5487.  Quod scientificum sit receptaculum boni, pauci sciunt quia pauci reflectunt super talia; sciri tamen potest ex his: scientifica quae intrant in memoriam, semper introducuntur per 
aliquam affectionem; quae non per aliquam affectionem introducuntur, (t)ibi non haerent sed praeterlabuntur; causa est quia affectioni inest vita, non autem scientificis nisi per affectionem; inde patet 
quod scientifica sibi semper conjuncta habeant talia quae sunt affectionis, seu quod idem, quae sunt amoris alicujus, consequenter aliquod bonum, nam omne quod est amoris, vocatur bonum sive sit 
bonum sive putetur esse bonum; formant itaque scientifica cum bonis illis sicut conjugium; inde est quod cum bonum illud excitatur, etiam ilico excitetur scientificum cum quo illud conjunctum est; ut 
et vicissim, cum scientificum revocatur, etiam bonum ei conjunctum prodeat; hoc unusquisque apud se, si libet, experiri potest. [2]Inde nunc est quod apud non regeneratos qui bonum charitatis rejecerunt, 
scientifica quae sunt vera Ecclesiae, adjuncta sibi habeant talia quae sunt amoris sui et mundi, ita mala quae ob jucundum quod inest, vocant bona, et quoque per sinistras interpretationes faciunt 
bona; haec scientifica prodeunt ad apparentiam concinne, cum amores illi universaliter regnant, et secundum gradum quo regnant; at apud regeneratos {2}, scientifica quae sunt vera Ecclesiae, adjuncta 
sibi habent talia quae sunt amoris erga proximum et amoris in Deum, ita genuina bona; haec a Domino reponuntur in veris Ecclesiae apud omnes qui regenerantur; quapropter cum Dominus apud hos insinuat 
zelum pro bono, vera illa tunc suo ordine prodeunt, et quando zelum pro vero, bonum illud adest et accendit eum. Ex his constare potest quomodo se habet cum scientificis et cum veris, quod sint receptacula 
boni. @1 see p. 176, ft 2$ @2 i qui bonum charitatis receperunt a Domino$  </p>
