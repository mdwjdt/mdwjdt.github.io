<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4180节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4180.</strong>“若不是我父亲的神，亚伯拉罕的神，就是以撒所敬畏的，与我同在”表若不是神性和神性人身。这从“我父亲的神”、“亚伯拉罕的神”、“以撒所敬畏的”的含义清楚可知：当论及主时，“我父亲的神”是指良善方面的神性，“圣父”是指神性良善，“圣子”是指神性真理（<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>，<a href="3704.htm">3704</a>节），在此是指每种本质的神性良善；“亚伯拉罕的神”是指被称为神性本质的神性本身，因为亚伯拉罕代表神性本身方面的主（<a href="2011.htm">2011</a>，<a href="3439.htm">3439</a>节）；“以撒所敬畏的”是指神性人身。经上之所以用“敬畏的”这个词，是因为它所表示的是神性真理。因为对那些未处于良善的人来说，神性真理含有害怕、恐惧、惊恐在里面，不像不会使人害怕的神性良善。在本章后面出现的这个词意思也一样：<br />雅各就指着他父亲以撒所敬畏的起誓。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创31.53.htm">31:53</a>）<br />由于现在拉班已经与雅各分离，也就是说，居间或中间良善与神性良善分离，所以拉班处于这种状态：他想加害，这一点从论到拉班的事明显看出来。正因他的状态是这样，所以经上才说“以撒所敬畏的”。谁都能看出，“以撒所敬畏的”表示以撒的神，还能看出，拉班处于这种状态。以撒代表主的神性人身，尤其代表该人身的神性理性（参看<a href="1893.htm">1893</a>，<a href="2066.htm">2066</a>，<a href="2072.htm">2072</a>，<a href="2083.htm">2083</a>，<a href="2630.htm">2630</a>，<a href="3012.htm">3012</a>，<a href="3194.htm">3194</a>，<a href="3210.htm">3210</a>，<a href="3704.htm">3704</a>节）。<br />就前面所说出自主的神性真理含有恐惧在里面，不像神性良善而言，情况是这样：从主所发出的神圣本身拥有神性良善与神性真理在里面。这些不断从主发出，是闪耀在诸天堂的光之源头，因而是闪耀在人类心智中的光之源头。因此，它们就是智慧和聪明的源头，因为这些就存在这光里面。但这光或智慧和聪明照众人的接受方式而感染他们。那些陷入邪恶的人不接受神性良善，因为他们没有爱或仁；事实上，一切良善都是爱和仁的显现。然而，神性真理甚至能被恶人接受，不过仅被他们的外在人接受，不被他们的内在人接受。<br />这就像出自太阳的热和光。属灵之热是爱，因而是良善；而属灵之光是信，因而是真理。当接受太阳的热时，树和花就会生长，长出叶子，开花、结果或种子。这一切发生在春夏时节。然而，当不接受太阳的热，只接受光时，什么东西也不长，而是万物萧条，如秋冬时节的情形。这同样适用于出自主的属灵之热和光。人若如春夏一般，便会接受从爱与仁所流出的良善，并结出果子；但若如秋冬一般，就不会接受爱与仁所流出的良善，因此结不出果子。然而，他仍能接受光，也就是说，仍能知道信仰或真理的事。冬光具有和夏光同样的效果，因为它也产生五彩缤纷的景象，使它们显眼，和夏光一样。但不同之处在于，它没有渗透到内层，因为它里面没有热，因而万物无法生长。<br />因此，只接受光，不接受良善，就如同物体不接受热。仅仅外在形式和这形式的美丽从光被接受，以致它们里面是冷的；当里面是冷的时，它们就都不活跃，当光照进来时，可以说看上去就像畏缩和战栗。这就是那些在活物中造成害怕、恐惧、惊恐的。这种对比能使人在某种程度上理解恶人所体验的害怕、恐惧、惊恐的性质。也就是说，这些感觉不是神性良善的产物，而是神性真理的产物；当人们不接受神性良善，却接受神性真理时，它们就会出现。这种对比也能使人理解，缺乏良善的神性真理无法渗透到内层，而是仍附着于最外层，也就是附着于外在人，主要附着于属外在人的感官部分。不仅如此，它还使人理解人有时在外在形式上看起来很漂亮，但在内在形式上却污秽可憎。由此也可以看出许多人当中信仰的性质，他们声称信就得救，无需善行或好行为，也就是没有善意和好行为。<br />神性真理从主的神性人身发出，而不是从神性本身发出。这是一个奥秘，至今尚未公开。这个奥秘的含义如下：在主降世之前，神性本身就流入整个天堂；由于那时天堂大部分是由属天之人，也就是那些处于爱之良善的人组成，所以神全能的流注提供了照耀在天上的光，以及伴随这光的智慧和聪明。但人类远离爱与仁的良善后，那光就不再可能经由天堂被提供了，因而智慧和聪明也不可能深入到人类这里。由于这个原因，为了人类能得救，主有必要来到世上，使祂自己里面的人身变成神性，以便就其神性人身而言，祂也能变成神性之光，从而光照整个天堂和整个世界。祂自永恒就是光本身，因为穿越诸天堂的神性本身就是那光的源头。正是神性本身披上人身，使这人身变成神性；一旦这人身变成神性，祂由此不仅能将光带给属天天堂本身，还能带给属灵天堂，也能带给人类，人类曾接受、现仍接受良善，也就是对主之爱和对邻之仁里面的神性真理。这明显可见于约翰福音:<br />凡接待祂的，就是信祂名的人，祂就赐他们权柄，作神的儿女。这等人不是从血生的，不是从肉欲生的，也不是从人意生的，乃是从神生的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.12.htm">1:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.13.htm">13</a>）<br />综上所述，清楚可知约翰福音中的这些话是什么意思：<br />太初有道，道与神同在，道就是神。这道太初与神同在。万物是藉着祂造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是藉着祂造的。生命在祂里头，这生命就是人的光。那光是真光，照亮一切生在世上的人。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.4.htm">4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.9.htm">9</a>等）<br />“道”（即圣言）在此表示神性真理。然而，主就两个本质而言，都是神性良善，神性真理从祂发出（参看<a href="3704.htm">3704</a>节）。因为神性良善无法被任何，甚至任何天使接受，只能被主的神性人身接受，这就是约翰福音中这些话的意思：<br />从来没有人见过神，只有在父怀里的独生子将祂表明出来。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.18.htm">1:18</a>）<br />但神性真理能被接受，尽管只是形式上有可能存在于接受者当中。神性良善能居于这神性真理里面，只是因接受而方式各不相同。<br />当人读到“若不是我父亲的神，亚伯拉罕的神，就是以撒所敬畏的，与我同在”这些话时，这就是呈现在天使脑海中的奥秘。由此明显可知，圣言及其每个细节里面含有多少天堂的成分，尽管这些成分无一显现在字义中；还可知与人的智慧相比，天使智慧多么优越；天使能意识到最深层的奥秘，而人甚至不知道圣言竟然还包含什么奥秘。所到的这些事还只是极少数，因为天使在这些奥秘中看见并感知到无数细节。事实上，与这少数奥秘相比，天使能看到无穷无尽的细节，而这些细节根本无法在此说出来，因为人类的语言不足以表达它们，人类心智也不能接受它们。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4180</b></p><p><b>4180.</b>
Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Dread of Isaac, had been with me. That this signifies unless the Divine and the Divine Human, is evident from the signification of "the God of 
my father," when predicated of the Lord, as being the Divine as to good; the "Father" being the Divine good, and the "Son" the Divine truth (n. 2803, 3704), here, the Divine good of each Essence; from 
the signification of "the God of Abraham," as being the Divine Itself which is called the Divine Essence, for Abraham represents the Lord as to the Divine Itself (n. 2011, 3439); and from the signification 
of the "Dread of Isaac," as being the Divine Human. The "Dread" is mentioned because the Divine truth is meant, for the Divine truth carries with it fear, dread, and terror to those who are not 
in good; but not so the Divine good, which terrifies no one. The same is meant further on in this chapter: "Jacob swore by the Dread of his father Isaac" (verse 53). For as Laban was then separated 
from Jacob (that is, the mediate good separated from good Divine) he was in such a state as to wish to inflict evil, as is manifest from what is said of Laban. Therefore as he was in such a state, it 
is said the "Dread of Isaac." That the "Dread of Isaac" means the God of Isaac, everyone can see, and also that Laban was in that state. Isaac represents the Lord's Divine Human, and this as to the Divine 
rational (n. 1893, 2066, 2072, 2083, 2630, 3012, 3194, 3210, 3973).  [2] As to the Divine truth which is from the Lord carrying fear with it to those who are not in good, but not the Divine good, 
the case is this: The Holy which proceeds from the Lord has in itself Divine good and Divine truth. These proceed continually from the Lord. From them is the light which is in the heavens, and therefore 
the light which is in human minds, and consequently wisdom and intelligence, for these are within that light. But that light, or wisdom and intelligence, affects all according to their reception. 
Those who are in evil do not receive the Divine good, for they are in no love and charity; for all good is of love and charity. The Divine truth however can be received even by the evil, but only by 
their external man, not by their internal. [3] This is like the heat and light from the sun. Spiritual heat is love, and thus good; but spiritual light is faith, and thus truth. When heat is received 
from the sun, the trees and flowers vegetate and produce leaves, flowers, and fruits or seeds. This comes to pass in the time of spring and summer. When however heat is not received from the sun, but 
only light, nothing vegetates, but all vegetation grows torpid, as in the time of autumn and winter. So also it is with spiritual heat and light, which are from the Lord. If man is like spring or summer, 
he receives the good of love and charity, and produces fruits; but if he is like autumn and winter, he does not receive the good of love and charity, and accordingly does not produce fruits. Yet 
he may still receive light, that is, may know the things of faith or truth. Wintry light has a similar effect, for it presents colors and beauties and makes them conspicuous, like summer light, but with 
the difference that it does not penetrate toward the interiors, because there is no heat in it, and hence no quickening.  [4] When therefore good is not received, but only light, it is as when heat 
is not received in objects, but only an image of form and beauty from the light, and hence there is cold within; and where there is cold within, there is a torpor of everything there, and as it were 
a shrinking and shuddering when light introduces itself there. This is what causes fear, dread, and terror in living things. By this comparison it may in some degree be comprehended how it is with the 
fear, dread, and terror that come to the evil-that is, that they do not come from the Divine good, but from the Divine truth, and this when they do not receive the Divine good, and yet receive the Divine 
truth. Also, that Divine truth without good cannot penetrate toward the interiors, but merely adheres to the extremes, that is, to the external man, and mostly to its sensuous part; and that from 
this a man sometimes appears beautiful in the external form, when yet he is foul in the internal form. From this it may also be seen what is the nature of the faith that exists with very many, which 
they say saves without good works, that is, without willing well and acting well.  [5] As the Divine truth proceeds from the Divine Human, but not from the Divine Itself, it is therefore the Divine 
Human which is here signified by the "Dread of Isaac;" for, as just now said, it is the Divine truth which terrifies, but not the Divine good. That the Divine truth proceeds from the Lord's Divine Human, 
but not from the Divine Itself, is an arcanum not hitherto disclosed. The case is this: Before the Lord came into the world the Divine Itself flowed into the whole heaven; and as heaven then consisted 
for the most part of the celestial, that is, of those who were in the good of love, through this influx, by the Divine Omnipotence, there was brought forth the light which was in the heavens, and 
thereby wisdom and intelligence. But after the human race had removed itself from the good of love and charity, that light could no longer be produced through heaven, nor, consequently, the wisdom and 
intelligence that would penetrate down to the human race. For this cause, from the necessity of their being saved, the Lord came into the world, and made the Human in Himself Divine, in order that as 
to His Divine Human He might become the Divine Light, and might thus illuminate the universal heaven and the universal world. From eternity He had been the Light itself, for that Light was from the 
Divine Itself through heaven. And it was the Divine Itself which took on the human, and made this Divine; and when this was made Divine, He could then thereby illuminate not only the celestial heaven 
itself, but also the spiritual heaven, and likewise the human race, which received and receives the Divine truth in good, that is, in love to Him and in charity toward the neighbor, as is manifest in 
John: </p>
<p>     As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, to them that believe on His name; who were born, not of bloods, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, 
but of God (John 1:12-13). [6] From what has now been said we can see what is signified by these words in John: </p>
<p>     In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. 
The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. That was the true light, 
that lighteth every man that cometh into the world (John 1:1-4, 9 seq.). The "Word" here signifies the Divine truth. Nevertheless that the Lord is Divine good as to each essence, and that the Divine 
truth proceeds from Him, may be seen above (n. 3704). For the Divine good cannot be received by man, nor even by an angel, but only by the Lord's Divine Human, as is meant by these words in John: </p>
<p> 
    No one hath seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath exhibited Him (John 1:18). But the Divine truth can be received, but in such a quality as is possible 
with the man who receives; and in this the Divine good can dwell, with a difference according to the reception.  [7] Such are the arcana which are presented to the angels when these words are 
read by man: "Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Dread of Isaac, had been with me." From this it is manifest how much that is heavenly there is in the Word, and in every particular 
of it, even when nothing of it is apparent in the sense of the letter; and also what angelic wisdom is in comparison with human wisdom; and that the angels are in the highest arcana while the man does 
not even know that there is any arcanum within. But these things which have been mentioned are only a very few, for in these arcana the angels see and perceive things innumerable, nay, things relatively 
unlimited, which cannot possibly be uttered, because human speech is not adequate to express them, nor is the human mind capable of receiving them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4180</b></p><p><b>4180.</b>
'Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Dread of Isaac, had been with me' means but for the Divine and the Divine Human. This is clear from the meaning of 'the God of my father' when 
used in reference to the Lord, as the Divine as regards Good - 'Father' meaning Divine Good, and 'Son' Divine Truth, see <a href="2803.htm">2803</a>, <a href="3704.htm">3704</a>, in this case the Divine Good of each Essence; from the meaning of 
'the God of Abraham' as the Divine itself which is called the Divine Essence - 'Abraham' representing the Lord as regards the Divine itself, <a href="2011.htm">2011</a>, <a href="3439.htm">3439</a>; and from the meaning of 'the Dread of Isaac' as 
the Divine Human. The expression 'the Dread' is used because it is Divine Truth that is meant by it. For among people who are not governed by good Divine Truth holds fear, dread, and terror within it, 
unlike Divine Good which does not strike fear into anyone. The same expression and meaning occur later on in this chapter, </p>
<p>Jacob swore by the Dread of Isaac his father. Verse 53. </p>
<p>Because he had 
been separated from Jacob by now, that is, because intermediate good had been separated from Divine good, Laban's state was such that he wished to do harm, as is evident from the things that are mentioned 
regarding Laban. It is because his state was such that the expression 'the Dread of Isaac' is used. Anyone can see that 'the Dread of Isaac' means the God of Isaac, and also that Laban's state 
was such. For 'Isaac' represents the Lord's Divine Human, in particular as regards the Divine Rational, see <a href="1893.htm">1893</a>, <a href="2066.htm">2066</a>, <a href="2072.htm">2072</a>, <a href="2083.htm">2083</a>, <a href="2630.htm">2630</a>, <a href="3012.htm">3012</a>, <a href="3194.htm">3194</a>, <a href="3210.htm">3210</a>, <a href="3704.htm">3704</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards what is said above, 
that Divine Truth coming from the Lord, unlike Divine Good, holds dread within it so far as those not governed by good are concerned, the position is this: The holiness which radiates from the Lord has 
Divine Good and Divine Truth within it. These go forth from the Lord unceasingly and are the source of the light which shines in the heavens and the source of the light which shines in human minds. 
Consequently they are the source of wisdom and intelligence, for these are present within that light. But the way in which anyone is affected by that light, or wisdom and intelligence, depends on how 
he receives it. Those who are governed by evil do not receive Divine Good since they possess no love or charity, for everything good is a manifestation of love and charity. But Divine Truth is able to 
be received even by the evil, though only by their external man, not by their internal. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 It is like the warmth and light which come from the sun. Spiritual warmth is love, and so good, whereas 
spiritual light is faith, and so truth. When warmth from the sun is being received, trees and flowers grow, producing leaves and blossom and fruit, or seeds. This occurs in spring and summer-time. But 
when warmth from the sun is not received, only light, nothing grows. All vegetation then becomes inactive, as it does in autumn and winter-time. The same also applies to spiritual warmth and spiritual 
light which come from the Lord. If a person is spring-like or summer-like he receives the good which flows from love and charity and produces fruit; but if he is autumn-like or winter-like he does not 
receive that good and therefore does not produce any fruit. Yet he is still able to receive light, that is, he is able to know things that are matters of faith or truth. The effect of the light of 
winter is similar to that of summer, in that it too produces colourful and beautiful sights and enables them to be seen. But it is different in that it does not penetrate beneath the surface because it 
has no warmth in it, and as a consequence nothing can grow. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The reception of light alone therefore and not of good is as when objects do not receive any warmth. Merely the outward form and the 
beauty of that form is received from the light, so that they are cold within; and when they are cold within they are all inactive, looking so to speak like something wrinkled with its hairs standing 
on end when the light meets it. And these are the conditions which produce fear, dread, and terror in living creatures. This comparison enables one to comprehend to some extent the nature of the fear, 
dread, and terror experienced by the evil. That is to say, such feelings are not the product of Divine Good but of Divine Truth; and they occur when people do not receive Divine Good yet do receive 
Divine Truth. The comparison also enables one to comprehend that Divine Truth devoid of Good cannot penetrate beneath the surface but stays in the outermost parts, that is, in the external man, and mainly 
in the area of sensory awareness belonging to the external man. More than this it enables one to comprehend that a person may sometimes look beautiful in outward form and yet in inward form be detestable. 
From all this one may also see the nature of the faith with very many - faith which, they say, saves without good works, that is, without goodwill and good actions. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 It being the Divine 
Human, and not the Divine itself, from which Divine Truth proceeds, it is the Divine Human therefore which is meant here by 'the Dread of Isaac'. For as has been stated, it is Divine Truth which strikes 
fear into someone, not Divine Good. That it is the Lord's Divine Human, and not the Divine itself, from which Divine Truth proceeds is an arcanum that has not been disclosed up to now. The implications 
of the arcanum are as follows: Before the Lord came into the world the Divine itself flowed into the whole of heaven; and because heaven at that time consisted for the most part of those who were 
celestial, that is, who were governed by the good of love, that influx of God's Almighty power furnished the light which shone in the heavens, and with that light wisdom and intelligence. But when 
the human race departed from the good of love and charity it was no longer possible for that light to be provided by way of heaven, nor consequently for the wisdom and intelligence to come through to 
the human race. For this reason, so that the human race might be saved, the Lord out of necessity came into the world and made Divine the Human within Himself in order that as to that Divine Human He 
might become Divine Light, and in so doing might bring light to the whole of heaven and to the whole world. He had been from eternity Light itself, for the Divine itself passing through the heavens was 
the source of that Light. And it was the Divine itself which took on the Human and made this Human Divine; and once that Human had been made Divine He was then able to bring light not only to the celestial 
heaven itself but also to the spiritual heaven, and to the human race too, which received and receives Divine Truth within good, that is, within love to Him and within charity towards the neighbour, 
as is evident in John, </p>
<blockquote>
As many as received Him, to them He gave power to be sons of God, to those believing in His name, who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the 
will of man, but of God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:12, 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 The things that have now been stated make clear the meaning of the following in John, </p>
<blockquote>
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the 
Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made. In Him was life, and the life was the Light of men. He was the true 
Light that enlightens every man coming into the world. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:1-4,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:1-4, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the Word' means Divine Truth. Yet as to both Essences the Lord is Divine Good, whereas Divine Truth is that which proceeds 
from Him, see <a href="3704.htm">3704</a>. For Divine Good cannot be received by any man, nor even by any angel, but only by the Lord's Divine Human, which is what the following words in John are used to mean, </p>
<blockquote>
Nobody 
has ever seen God; the only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, He has made Him known. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Man is however able to receive Divine Truth, though only in a form possible for it to exist 
with the recipient. And within that Truth, Divine Good is able to dwell, but in differing ways according to the kind of reception it is given. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 Such are the arcana which come to mind among 
the angels when man reads the words 'Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Dread of Isaac, had been with me'. It shows how heavenly in content the Word is, and every detail of it, although 
nothing of that content is visible in the sense of the letter. It also shows how superior angelic wisdom is to human wisdom, and that angels are aware of the deepest arcana while man does not even 
know that the Word contains any arcanum at all. Those which have been mentioned are only a very few, for within these arcana angels see and perceive countless details. Indeed, compared with those 
few arcana an infinity of details are seen by angels which cannot possibly be made known here because human language is inadequate to express what they are. Nor is the human mind capable of receiving them. </p>

inde lux  quae caelis {1},    et inde lux quae in   mentibus humanis, consequenter inde sapientia et intelligentia, nam hae luci illi insunt {2}; sed lux illa   seu sapientia et intelligentia 
afficit omnes     secundum receptionem; </p>
<p>qui in malo sunt, non recipiunt Divinum Bonum, nam in nullo amore et charitate sunt, omne enim bonum est amoris et charitatis; sed Divinum Verum recipi potest, 
etiam a malis, at modo ab externo illorum homine, non ab interno: [3] se habet hoc sicut calor et lux quae a sole; calor spiritualis est amor, ita bonum, lux autem spiritualis est fides, ita 
verum; cum calor a sole recipitur, tunc arbore et flores vegetant, producunt folia, flores, fructus aut semina; hoc fit tempore veris et aestatis, at cum calor a sole non recipitur, sed solum lux, 
tunc nihil vegetat, at {3} omne vegetativum torpescit, sicut fit tempore autumni et hiemis; ita (t)quoque se habet cum calore spirituali  et luce spirituali quae a Domino, si homo est instar veris 
seu aestatis, tunc recipit bonum quod est amoris et charitatis, et producit fructus, at si homo est instar autumni et hiemis, tunc non recipit bonum amoris et charitatis, proinde non producit fructus, 
sed usque recipere potest lucem, hoc est, scire illa quae fidei seu veri sunt; lux hiemalis {4} simile facit, nam sistit similiter colores et pulchritudines, et illas conspicuas facit, sed cum 
differentia quod non penetret versus interiora quia non ibi calor, inde nulla vegetatio.  [4] Cum itaque {5} bonum non recipitur, sed modo lux, tunc est sicut in objectis (t)calor non recipitur, modo 
{6} formae imago et formositas {7} a luce, inde intus est frigus, (o)et ubi frigus intus, ibi torpor omnium {8}, et quasi {9} corrugatio et horripilatio {10} cum illuc lux se indit; haec sunt quae 
in vivis faciunt timorem, pavorem et terrorem: per hanc comparationem aliquatenus comprehendi potest quomodo se habet cum timore, pavore et terrore qui apud malos, quod nempe illa non sint a Divino 
Bono sed a Divino Vero, et quod tunc sint quando non recipiunt Divinum Bonum, et tamen recipiunt Divinum Verum; tum quod Divinum Verum; </p>
<p>absque Bono, non penetrare possit versus interiora, sed 
modo haereat in extremis, hoc est, in externo homine, ac ut plurimum in ejus sensuali; et quod inde appareat homo in externa forma quandoque pulcher, cum tamen in interna sit foedus.  Inde quoque constare 
potest qualis fides apud perplures sit, quam dicunt salvare absque bonis operibus, hoc est, absque bene velle et {11} bene agere.  (s)Quia a Divino Humano procedit Divinum Verum, non autem 
ab Ipso Divino, ideo Divinum Humanum est quod hic significatur per `Pavorem Jishaki,' nam, ut dictum, Divinum Verum est quod terret, non autem Divinum Bonum.  Quod a Divino Humano Domini procedat 
Divinum Verum, non autem ab Ipso Divino, est arcanum hactenus non detectum; cum hoc ita se habet: antequam Dominus venit in mundum, tunc Ipsum Divinum influxit in universum caelum, et quia tunc caelum 
constabat quoad maximam partem a caelestibus, hoc est, ab illis qui in bono amoris fuerunt, per influxum illum ex Omnipotentia Divina producebatur lux quae in caelis, et inde sapientia et intelligentia; 
at postquam humanum genus se removit a bono amoris et charitatis, tunc non amplius per caelum produci potuit lux illa, proinde non sapientia et intelligentia quae penetraret usque ad genus 
humanum, quapropter ex necessitate ut salvaretur, Dominus in mundum venit ac Humanum in Se Divinum fecit ut Ipse quoad Divinum Humanum fieret Lux Divina, et sic universum caelum et universum mundum 
illuminaret: fuerat Ipsa {12} Lux ab aeterno, nam ab Ipso Divino per caelum illa Lux; ac Ipsum Divinum erat quod suscepit Humanum et Hoc Divinum fecit, et cum Hoc Divinum factum est, tunc ab Illo 
non modo illuminare potuit ipsum caelum caeleste, sed etiam caelum spirituale, et quoque genus humanum, quod recepit et recipit Divinum Verum in bono, hoc est, in amore in Ipsum et in charitate erga 
proximum, ut patet apud Johannem,           Quotquot receperunt, dedit illis potestatem, ut filii      Dei essent, credentibus in nomen Ipsius; qui non ex      sanguinibus, neque e voluntate carnis, 
neque ex voluntate      viri, sed ex Deo nati sunt, i 12, [13]. [6] Ex his quae nunc dicta sunt, constare potest quid per haec apud Johannem significantur,           In principio erat Verbum, 
et Verbum erat apud Deum, et      Deus erat Verbum: hoc erat in principio apud Deum; omnia per      Ipsum facta sunt, et sine Ipso factum est nihil quod factum      est. In Ipso vita erat, et vita 
erat Lux hominum. Erat Lux      vera, quae illuminat omnem hominem venientem in mundum, i      1-4 9 seq. `Verbum' ibi significat Divinum Verum: quod autem Dominus quoad utramque Essentiam sit 
Divinum Bonum, at quod ab Ipso procedat Divinum Verum, videatur n. 3704; Divinum enim Bonum non recipi potest ab homine, ne quidem ab angelo, (o)sed solum a Divino Humano Domini, quod intelligitur 
per haec verba apud Johannem,           Deum nemo vidit unquam, Unigenitus Filius, Qui in sin      Patris est, Ille exposuit, i 18; </p>
<p>sed recipi potest Divinum Verum, at quale dari potest {13} apud hominem 
qui recipit; in quo vero habitare potest Divinum Bonum cum differentia secundum receptionem.  Talia (o)arcana sunt quae obveniunt angeli cum ab homine leguntur {14} haec verba, `Nisi Deus patris 
mei, Dei Abrahami et Pavor Jishaki, fuisset mihi'; inde patet quantum caeleste inest Verbo et singulis Verbi, tametsi nihil ejus apparet in sensu litterae; et inde quoque patet qualis sapientia 
angelica est prae sapientia humana; et quod angeli in arcanissimis sint, cum homo ne quidem scit quod aliquod arcanum insit: sed haec quae memorata sunt, modo paucula sunt, in his enim arcanis angeli 
vident et percipiunt innumerabilia, immo respective indefinita quae nusquam possunt edici, quia loquela humana non est adaequata illis exprimendis, nec mens humana capax recipiendi.(s)      @1
