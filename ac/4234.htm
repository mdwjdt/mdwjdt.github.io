<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4234节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4234.</strong>“雅各仍旧行路”表真理朝它与属灵和属天良善的结合逐渐发展。这从“雅各”的代表清楚可知，“雅各”在此是指属世层的真理。前面早已阐述了“雅各”代表什么，即代表主的属世层。由于在历史叙事中论述雅各的地方，在内义上论述的是主，以及祂如何使自己的属世层变成神性，故雅各先是代表该属世层里面的真理，然后代表与“拉班”所表旁系良善联结的真理。一旦该良善与它联结，雅各就代表这种良善。然而，这种良善并不是属世层里面的神性良善，而是一种居间或中间良善，主通过这居间或中间良善能接受神性良善。这种居间或中间良善就由与拉班分离时的雅各代表，尽管本质上这种良善是真理，就是能够凭着这种居间或中间良善而与属世层里面的神性良善结合的真理。雅各现在所代表的，正是这种真理。<br />不过，与这种真理结合的良善则由“以扫”来代表，以扫是指主的神性属世层的神性良善（参看<a href="3300.htm">3300</a>，<a href="3302.htm">3302</a>，<a href="3494.htm">3494</a>，<a href="3504.htm">3504</a>，<a href="3527.htm">3527</a>，<a href="3576.htm">3576</a>，<a href="3599.htm">3599</a>，<a href="3669.htm">3669</a>，<a href="3677.htm">3677</a>节）。就至高意义而言，现在所论述的主题正是主的神性属世层的神性真理与神性良善的实际结合。因为一旦雅各离开拉班，来到约旦河，因而进入迦南地的入口处，他就代表这种结合；因为迦南地在内义上表示天堂，在至高意义上表示主的神性人身（<a href="3038.htm">3038</a>，<a href="3705.htm">3705</a>节）。正因如此，“雅各仍旧行路”表增真理朝它与属灵和属天良善的结合逐渐发展。<br />不过，这些事具有这样的性质，它们根本不可能被充分而理性地阐述清楚；其原因在于，在基督教界，学者们连对这个主题的最基本或模糊的概念都没有。事实上，几乎没有人知道何为人的属世层，何为其理性层，也不知道这二者完全不同，彼此分离。甚至几乎没有人知道何为属灵真理，或何为这真理的良善，也不知道这些同样是完全不同，彼此分离的。更鲜为人知的是，当人正在重生时，真理便与良善结合，并且在属世层里面以一种不同而又分离的方式、在理性层里面又以另一种方式通过无数手段结合。事实上，人们甚至不知道主是照着祂重生人所遵循的那种次序来使祂的人身变成神性。<br />因此，由于人们连这些最基本或模糊的概念都没有，所以有关它们的说明必显得晦涩难懂。然而，之所以阐述它们，是因为圣言的内义无法以其它方式来解释。至少它们将表明天使智慧何等伟大，以及它的性质，因为圣言的内义主要适合天使。</p>

And Jacob went to his way. That this signifies the successive advance of truth toward its conjunction with spiritual and celestial good, is evident from the representation of Jacob, as being here the 
truth of the natural. What Jacob represented has been already stated, namely, the Lord's natural; and as where Jacob is treated of in the historical narrative, in the internal sense the Lord is treated 
of, and how He made His natural Divine, therefore Jacob first represented the truth in that natural, and then the truth to which was adjoined the collateral good which was "Laban;" and after the Lord 
had adjoined this good, Jacob represented it; but such good is not the good Divine in the natural, but is a mediate good by means of which the Lord could receive good Divine; and this mediate good 
was the good that Jacob represented when he withdrew from Laban. Nevertheless in itself this good is truth which from its mediate character possesses the capacity of conjoining itself with the good Divine 
in the natural. Such then is the truth that Jacob now represents.  [2] But the good with which this truth was to be conjoined is represented by Esau. (That Esau is the Divine good of the Lord's 
Divine natural, may be seen above, n. 3300, 3302, 3494, 3504, 3527, 3576, 3599, 3669, 3677.) It is this very conjunction of truth Divine with the good Divine of the Lord's Divine natural, that is now 
treated of in the supreme sense. For after Jacob withdrew from Laban and came to the Jordan, thus to the first entrance into the land of Canaan, he advances into the representation of this conjunction; 
for in the internal sense the land of Canaan signifies heaven, and in the supreme sense the Lord's Divine Human (n. 3038, 3705). It is for this reason that by the words, "and Jacob went to his way," 
is signified the successive advance of truth toward conjunction with spiritual and celestial good.  [3] But these things are of such a nature as to prevent their being fully set forth to the apprehension; 
the cause of which is that the most general things of this subject are unknown in the learned world, even among Christians. For it is scarcely known what the natural in man is, and what the rational, 
and that these are altogether distinct from each other; and scarcely even what spiritual truth is, and what its good, and that these also are most distinct from each other. Still less is it known 
that when man is being regenerated, truth is conjoined with good, in one distinct way in the natural, and in another distinct way in the rational, and this by innumerable means. It is not even known 
that the Lord made His Human Divine according to the same order as that in which He regenerates man.  [4] Since therefore these most general things are unknown, it must needs be that whatever is said 
about them will appear obscure. Nevertheless they have to be stated, because otherwise the Word cannot be unfolded as to its internal sense. At the very least this may be the means of showing how great 
angelic wisdom is, and also of what kind it is, for the internal sense of the Word is chiefly for the angels. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4234</b></p><p><b>4234.</b>
'Jacob went on his way' means the progression of truth so that it might be joined to spiritual and celestial good. This is clear from the representation of 'Jacob' at this point as the truth of the natural. 
What 'Jacob' represented has been stated already, namely the Lord's Natural. And because the subject in the internal sense where the historical narrative has to do with Jacob is the Lord and how 
He made His Natural Divine, Jacob therefore first represented truth within that Natural and then truth to which the parallel good meant by Laban had been allied. And once this good had been allied 
to it Jacob represented that kind of good. That kind of good is not however Divine good within the Natural but intermediate good by means of which He was able to receive Divine good. Jacob represented 
such intermediate good when he departed from Laban, though essentially that good is truth, which by virtue of being intermediate has the capacity to join itself to Divine good within the Natural. It 
is that kind of truth that Jacob represents now. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The good however to which that truth was to be joined is represented by 'Esau' - 'Esau' being the Divine Good of the Lord's Divine Natural, see <a href="3300.htm">3300</a>, <a href="3302.htm">3302</a>, <a href="3494.htm">3494</a>, <a href="3504.htm">3504</a>, <a href="3527.htm">3527</a>, <a href="3576.htm">3576</a>, <a href="3599.htm">3599</a>, <a href="3669.htm">3669</a>, <a href="3677.htm">3677</a>. It is the actual joining together of the two - the joining of the Divine truth to the Divine good of the Lord's Divine Natural - that is the subject 
now in the highest sense. For once Jacob has departed from Laban and come to the Jordan, and so to the place of entry into the land of Canaan, he comes to represent that conjunction; for in the internal 
sense the land of Canaan means heaven, and in the highest sense the Lord's Divine Human, <a href="3038.htm">3038</a>, <a href="3705.htm">3705</a>. This explains why the words 'And Jacob went on his way' mean the progression of truth so that 
it might be joined to spiritual and celestial good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But these matters are such that a full and intelligible explanation of them cannot be given at all, for the reason that not even the learned 
in the Christian world possess the vaguest notions on the subject. For scarcely any knowledge exists of what man's natural is, or of what his rational is, or of the fact that the two are altogether distinct 
and separate from each other. Nor is there much knowledge of what spiritual truth is or of the good which goes with that truth, or of the fact that these likewise are distinct and separate. Still 
less is it known that when a person is being regenerated truth is joined to good, in one distinct and separate way in the natural, in another in the rational, and by means that are countless. In fact 
it is not even known that the Lord made His Human Divine according to the same order as that by which He regenerates man. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Since therefore not even the vaguest notions exist about these matters, 
any statements made about them are bound to seem obscure. Nevertheless such statements must be made because the internal sense of the Word cannot be explained in any other way. If nothing else they 
will show what angelic wisdom is and the nature of it, for the internal sense of the Word is primarily for angels. </p>

</p><b>4234.</b>
`Jacob ivit ad viam suam': quod significet successivum veri ut conjungeretur bono spirituali et caelesti, constat ex repraesentatione `Jacobi' quod hic sit verum naturalis; quid `Jacob' repraesentaverit, 
prius dictum est, quod nempe Naturale Domini; et quia agitur in sensu interno, ubi historice de Jacobo, de Domino quomodo Ipse Naturale Suum Divinum fecit, ideo Jacob primum repraesentavit 
verum ibi, et dein verum cui adjunctum est bonum collaterale, quod erat Laban {1}, et postquam hoc adjunxit, tunc repraesentavit Jacob bonum tale, sed tale bonum non est {2} bonum Divinum in Naturali, 
sed est {2} bonum medium, per quod recipere potuit bonum Divinum; tale bonum repraesentavit Jacob cum recederet a Labane, sed usque id bonum in se est verum, cui inde facultas se conjungendi cum 
bono Divino in Naturali: tale verum est quod Jacob nunc repraesentat.  [2] Bonum (o)autem cum quo conjungeretur, repraesentatur per `Esavum'; quod `Esavus' sit Divinum Bonum Divini Naturalis Domini, 
videatur n. 3300, 3302, 3494, 3504, 3527, 3576, 3599, 3669, 3677; de illa ipsa conjunctione, nempe veri Divini cum bono Divino (o)Divini Naturalis Domini in sensu supremo nunc agitur; nam postquam 
Jacob recessit a Labane et ad Jordanem venit, ita ad primum ingressum in terram Canaanem, ingreditur repraesentare conjunctionem illam; terra enim Canaan in sensu interno significat caelum, et 
in `supremo sensu' Divinum Humanum Domini, n. 3038, 3705; inde est quod per illa verba, `Et Jacob ivit ad viam suam' significetur successivum veri ut conjungeretur bono spirituali et caelesti. [3] 
Sed haec talia sunt quae nequaquam possunt plene ad captum exponi; causa est quia communissima hujus rei in orbe erudito etiam Christiano ignota sunt; vix enim scitur quid naturale apud hominem, et 
quid rationale, et quod illa inter se prorsus distincta sint; et quoque vix scitur quid verum (o)spirituale et quid bonum (o)ejus, quodque haec quoque distinctissima sint; et adhuc minus, quod cum 
homo regeneratur, verum conjungatur cum bono, distincte in naturali, et distincte in rationali, et haec {3} per innumerabilia media; immo ne quidem notum est quod Dominus Humanum Suum Divinum fecerit secundum 
ordinem secundum quem Dominus etiam regenerat hominem; [4] cum itaque communissima illa ignota sunt, non potest aliter quam quod obscura appareant quae de illis dicuntur; sed usque dicenda sunt, 
quia aliter non potest explicari Verbum quoad sensum internum {4}; ad minimum inde constare potest quae et qualis sapientia angelica est, nam Verbi sensus internus est principaliter pro angelis.
