<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1526节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1526.</strong>我从对身体之物的观念中被引离出来，以便可以被保守在属灵观念中。就在这时，一道钻石般的璀璨光芒出现了，并且持续了很长时间。我无法以其它方式来描述，因为它真的就象钻石一样闪闪发光，包括其最细微的一面。当我被保守在这光中时，我察觉到了一些特别的东西，就是世俗和肉体之物，它们在我下面，非常遥远；我由此被指教那些从物质观念中退出、进入属灵观念之人具有何等大的光明。此外，我经常看到灵人和天使所拥有的光，倘若把我的这些经历都记录下来，恐怕会填满很多纸张。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1526.</strong> I was drawn away from trivial ideas anchored in the body so that my attention could be kept on spiritual ideas. Then there appeared the vivid gleam of a diamond-bright light, and this lasted fairly long. I cannot describe the light in any other way, because it resembled something diamondlike gleaming in each minuscule element. As long as I was kept in that light, I perceived all worldly and body-centered minutiae as being a long way below me. The experience taught me what a bright light people enjoy when they withdraw from matter-based thinking and immerse themselves in spiritual ideas.<br />I have seen the light that shines on spirits and angels so many other times as well that if all my experiences were to be recounted, they would fill pages and pages. </p>

I was withdrawn from the ideas of particular things,* or those of the body, so that I might be kept in spiritual ideas. There then appeared a vivid glow of diamond light, and this for a considerable 
time. I cannot describe the light in any other way; for in its least parts it was like the sparkling of the diamond. And while I was kept in that light, I perceived the particular things, which are worldly 
and corporeal, as it were below me, and remote; by which I was instructed how great light those are in who are withdrawn from material ideas into those which are spiritual. Moreover, the light of 
spirits and of angels has been seen by me so many times, that many pages would be filled if all the experiences were recounted. * Compare n. 3885, and see note to n. 2481. [Reviser.] </p>

I was led away from ideas of particulars,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> that is, things of the body, so that my mind might be kept to spiritual ideas; at that time a brilliance was seen produced by flashes of light as from a diamond, 
and it remained for quite a long time. I cannot describe the light in any other way, for it was indeed like a diamond with a flashing brilliance in every tiniest facet. And while I was being kept 
in that light I perceived the particulars, which were things of a worldly and bodily kind, as being so to speak beneath me and far away. This taught me how much light those persons have who have been 
led away from material into spiritual ideas. Moreover I have seen the light spirits and angels have so many times that it would fill up page after page if I were to recount all my experiences.

</p><b>1526.</b>
Abductus sum ab ideis particularium seu corporis, sic ut in ideis spiritualibus detinerer; tunc apparuit rutilatio viva lucis adamantinae, et hoc satis diu; lucem non aliter possum describere, nam sicut 
adamantinum rutilans erat in singulis minimis; et quando tenebar in illa luce, particularia quae mundana et corporea erant, percipiebam tanquam infra me et remota; ex quibus instructus in quanta luce 
sunt, qui abducti ab ideis materialibus in spiritualibus sunt. Praeterea lux spirituum et angelorum toties mihi visa est ut paginae implerentur si experientiae omnes recenserentur. </p>
