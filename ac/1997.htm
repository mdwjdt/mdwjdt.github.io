<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1997节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1997.</strong>“使你极其繁多”表对真理的情感无限繁殖。这从“繁多”的含义清楚可知，“繁多”论及真理，如前面所解释的（<a href="43.htm">43</a>，<a href="55.htm">55</a>，<a href="913.htm">913</a>，<a href="983.htm">983</a>节）。由于论述的主题是主，故它表示源于良善的真理无限繁殖，如前所述（<a href="1940.htm">1940</a>节）。情感有两种：即对良善的情感和对真理的情感。对良善的情感在于出于对良善的热爱行善，对真理的情感在于出于对真理的热爱行善。乍一看，这两种情感似乎完全一样。但事实上，无论在本质上还是在来源上，它们彼此截然不同。严格来说，对良善的情感，或出于对良善的热爱行善，属于意愿；而对真理的情感，或出于对真理的热爱行善，属于理解力。因此，这两种情感像意愿和理解力那样彼此截然不同。对良善的情感源于属天之爱，而对真理的情感源于属灵之爱。<br />对良善的情感唯独用来论及属天之人，而对真理的情感则用来论及属灵之人。至于何为属天的和属天之人，何为属灵的和属灵之人，这在第一卷已予以充分说明。大洪水前的上古教会拥有对良善的情感，而大洪水后的古教会则拥有对真理的情感。因为前者是属天教会，而后者是属灵教会。在天堂，所有天使要么是属天的，要么是属灵的。属天的拥有对良善的情感，属灵的拥有对真理的情感。主向前者显为一轮太阳，向后者显为一轮月亮（<a href="1529.htm">1529</a>-<a href="1531.htm">1531</a>，<a href="1838.htm">1838</a>节）。当主将人性本质与神性本质融合起来时，祂便将后一种情感，即对真理的情感与对良善的情感融合起来，对良善的情感在于出于对良善的热爱行善。因此，“极其繁多”表源于良善的真理无限繁殖。</p>

I will multiply thee very exceedingly. That this signifies the fruitfulness to infinity of the affection of truth, may be seen from the signification of "to be multiplied," as being predicated of truth 
(explained, n. 43, 55, 913, 983); and as the Lord is treated of, it signifies the fruitfulness to infinity of the truth that is from good (as before, n. 1940). There are two affections, namely, the 
affection of good, and the affection of truth. The affection of good is to do what is good from the love of good, and the affection of truth is to do what is good from the love of truth. At the first 
view these two affections appear to be the same; but in reality they are distinct from each other both as to essence and as to origin. The affection of good, or doing what is good from the love of good, 
is properly of the will; but the affection of truth, or doing what is good from the love of truth, is properly of the understanding. Thus these two affections are distinct from each other in the same 
way as are the will and the understanding. The affection of good is from celestial love, but the affection of truth is from spiritual love.  [2] The affection of good can be predicated solely of 
the celestial man, but the affection of truth, of the spiritual man. What the celestial or the celestial man is, and what the spiritual or the spiritual man, has been sufficiently shown in Part First. 
The Most Ancient Church, which existed before the flood, was in the affection of good; but the Ancient Church, which existed after the flood, was in the affection of truth; for the former was a celestial 
church, but the latter a spiritual church. All the angels in the heavens are distinguished into the celestial and the spiritual. The celestial are they who are in the affection of good, the spiritual 
are they who are in the affection of truth; to the former the Lord appears as a sun, but to the latter as a moon (n. 1529-1531, 1838). This latter affection, of truth, the Lord united to the affection 
of good, which is to do what is good from the love of good, when He united the Human Essence to the Divine Essence. Hence by "multiplying very exceedingly," is signified the fruitfulness to infinity 
of the truth that is from good.  </p>

'I will multiply you more and more' means endless fruitfulness of the affection for truth. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'multiplying' as having reference to truth, dealt with in <a href="43.htm">43</a>, <a href="55.htm">55</a>, <a href="913.htm">913</a>, <a href="983.htm">983</a>. And because it refers to the Lord it means the endless fruitfulness of truth that flows from good, dealt with already in <a href="1940.htm">1940</a>. There are two types of affection- the affection for good and the affection 
for truth. The affection for good consists in doing good from a love of good, the affection for truth is doing good from a love of truth. At first glance these two types of affection seem to 
be identical, but they are quite distinct and separate from each other in essence as well as in origin. The affection for good, or doing good from a love of good, belongs strictly to the will, whereas 
the affection for truth, or doing good from a love of truth, belongs strictly to the understanding; thus these two types of affection are as distinct from each other as will and understanding. The affection 
for good springs from celestial love, but the affection for truth from spiritual love. The description 'affection for good' cannot be used except in reference to the celestial man, while 'affection 
for truth' is used in reference to the spiritual man. What the Celestial is and what the celestial man, and what the Spiritual or the spiritual man is, has been adequately shown in Volume One. The 
Most Ancient Church, which existed before the Flood, was stirred by the affection for good, but the Ancient Church, which existed after the Flood, was stirred by the affection for truth, for the former 
was a celestial Church, but the latter a spiritual Church. All angels in heaven are either celestial or spiritual. The celestial are stirred by the affection for good, the spiritual by the affection 
for truth. To the former the Lord appears as the Sun, to the latter however as the Moon, <a href="1529.htm">1529</a>-<a href="1531.htm">1531</a>, <a href="1838.htm">1838</a>. The latter affection, that is, the affection for truth, the Lord united to the affection for 
good, which consists in doing good from a love of good, when He united the Human Essence to the Divine Essence. Consequently 'multiplying more and more' means endless fruitfulness of truth deriving 
from good. </p>

`Multiplicabo te in valde valde': quod significet fructificationem affectionis veri in infinitum, constare potest a significatione `multiplicari' quod praedicetur de vero, de qua n. 43, 55, 913, 983; 
et quia de Domino, significat fructificationem veri ex bono in infinitum, de qua prius n. 1940.  Sunt binae affectiones, nempe affectio boni et affectio veri; affectio boni est facere bonum ex amore 
boni, affectio veri est facere bonum ex amore veri; hae binae affectiones apparent primo intuitu sicut forent eaedem, sed sunt in se distinctae, tam quoad essentiam quam quoad originem; affectio boni, 
seu facere bonum ex amore boni, est proprie voluntatis; sed affectio veri, seu facere bonum ex amore veri, est proprie intellectus; ita binae hae affectiones inter se distinctae sunt sicut voluntas 
et intellectus: affectio boni est ex amore caelesti, sed affectio veri est ex amore spirituali; affectio boni non praedicari potest nisi de homine caelesti, sed affectio veri de homine spirituali; quid 
caeleste et homo caelestis et quid spirituale {1} seu homo spiritualis, in Parte Prima satis ostensum est.  Antiquissima Ecclesia quae fuit ante diluvium, erat in affectione boni, sed Antiqua Ecclesia 
quae post diluvium, erat in affectione veri, illa enim erat Ecclesia caelestis, haec autem Ecclesia spiritualis; omnes angeli in caelis sunt distincti in caelestes et spirituales, caelestes sunt qui 
in affectione boni, spirituales qui in affectione veri; illis apparet Dominus ut Sol, his autem ut Luna, n. 1529-1531, 1838; hanc seu affectionem veri Dominus univit affectioni boni quae est facere 
bonum ex amore boni, cum Humanam Essentiam univit Divinae: inde per `multiplicari in valde valde' significatur fructificatio veri ex bono in infinitum. 	@1 et.$ </p>
