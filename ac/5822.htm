<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5822节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5822.</strong>“我们最小的兄弟若和我们同往，我们就可以下去”表除非实现联结的居间层与他们同在。这从便雅悯的代表清楚可知，便雅悯，即此处“最小的兄弟”，是指实现联结的居间层（参看<a href="5411.htm">5411</a>，<a href="5413.htm">5413</a>，<a href="5443.htm">5443</a>，<a href="5639.htm">5639</a>，<a href="5668.htm">5668</a>节）。对此，即便雅悯代表属灵层的属天层，或内在良善，就是约瑟，与属世层中的真理，就是“雅各的十个儿子”之间的居间层，以及代表新真理（参看<a href="5804.htm">5804</a>，<a href="5806.htm">5806</a>，<a href="5809.htm">5809</a>节），情况是这样：为成为一个居间层，居间层必须从内在与外在两边各取某种东西；否则，它就不是一个实现联结的居间层。<br />便雅悯所代表的居间层从外在或属世层（<a href="5686.htm">5686</a>，<a href="5689.htm">5689</a>节）。但居间层通过流注从“约瑟”所代表的内在获得品质。这就是它如何从两边各自获得某种东西；这也是为什么便雅悯代表实现联结的居间层，还代表新真理的原因。他与父亲同在时代表新真理，与约瑟同在时代表实现联结的居间层。这是一个奥秘，无法解释得更清楚；只有那些意识到以下事实，同时拥有对认识真理的情感之人才能理解，即：人有一个内在和一个外在，这内在与外在彼此不同且相互分离。这些人心智的理解力部分被天堂之光光照，从而使他们能看见别人看不见的东西，包括这个奥秘。</p>

If our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down. That this signifies unless there be with them a conjoining intermediate, is evident from the representation of Benjamin, who here is the "youngest 
brother," as being a conjoining intermediate (see n. 5411, 5413, 5443, 5639, 5668). In regard to this, that Benjamin represents the intermediate between the celestial of the spiritual, or internal 
good, which is "Joseph," and truths in the natural, which are the "ten sons of Jacob," and also that he represents new truth (as in n. 5804, 5806, 5809), the case is this. An intermediate in order 
to be an intermediate must derive something from each, namely from the internal and from the external; otherwise it is not a conjoining intermediate. The intermediate which Benjamin represents derives 
from the external or natural that it is new truth there; for the new truth which he represents is in the natural, because it is from the spiritual good from the natural, which his father represents as 
Israel (n. 5686, 5689); but the intermediate derives this by influx from the internal which is represented by Joseph. Thus it derives something from each. This is the reason why Benjamin represents 
a conjoining intermediate, and also new truth-new truth when with his father, a conjoining intermediate when with Joseph. This is a secret which cannot be more clearly set forth; and it cannot be understood 
except by those who are in the thought that there is with man an internal and an external distinct from each other; and who are also in the affection of knowing truths. These are enlightened in 
respect to the intellectual part by the light of heaven, so that they see what others do not see, thus also this secret. </p>

'If our youngest brother is with us we will go down' means unless the intermediary that accomplishes the joining together is with them. This is clear from the representation of Benjamin, to whom youngest 
brother' refers here, as the intermediary that accomplishes the joining together, dealt with in <a href="5411.htm">5411</a>, <a href="5413.htm">5413</a>, <a href="5443.htm">5443</a>, <a href="5639.htm">5639</a>, <a href="5688.htm">5688</a>. The implications of this - that 'Benjamin' represents the intermediary 
between the celestial of the spiritual or internal good, which is 'Joseph', and the truths in the natural, which are 'the ten sons of Jacob', as well as representing new truth, see above in <a href="5804.htm">5804</a>, <a href="5806.htm">5806</a>, <a href="5809.htm">5809</a> - are as follows: To be an intermediary, the intermediary must be derived both from the internal and from the external; otherwise it is not an intermediary that accomplishes a joining together. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
The intermediary, which 'Benjamin' represents, derives from the external or natural its existence there as new truth; for the new truth represented by him exists in the natural because it springs 
from spiritual good from the natural, which his father as Israel represents, <a href="5686.htm">5686</a>, <a href="5689.htm">5689</a>. But that intermediary derives from the internal the quality that 'Joseph' represents, by means of influx. 
This is how it is derived from both and is the reason why 'Benjamin' represents the intermediary that accomplishes the joining together, as well as representing new truth. He represents new truth when 
he is present with his father, the intermediary accomplishing the joining together when he is with Joseph. This is an arcanum for which no clearer explanation is possible; nor can it be understood except 
by those who are aware of the fact that a person has an internal and an external that are distinct and separate from each other, and who at the same time have an affection for knowing truths. The 
understanding part of these people's minds is lit by the light of heaven, enabling them to see what others do not see, including this arcanum. </p>

`Si sit frater noster minimus cum nobis, et descendemus': quod significet nisi una sit medium conjungens, constat ex repraesentatione `Benjaminis' qui hic est `frater minimus', quod sit medium conjungens, 
de qua n. 5411, 5413, 5443, 5639, 5688. (s)Cum hoc quod `Benjamin' repraesentet medium inter caeleste spiritualis seu bonum internum quod `Josephus' et inter vera in naturali quae sunt `decem filii 
Jacobi', et quoque quod repraesentet verum novum, supra n. 5804, 5806, 5809, ita se habet: medium, ut sit medium, trahet ab utroque, nempe ab interno et externo, alioquin non est medium conjungens; 
medium quod `Benjamin' repraesentat, trahit ab externo seu naturali quod sit ibi verum novum, [2] nam verum novum quod repraesentat, est in naturali quia est ex bono spirituali e naturali, quod `pater 
ejus ut Israel' repraesentat, n. 5686, 5689; at medium illud trahit ab interno quod {1}per Josephum repraesentatur, per influxum, ita trahit ab utroque; haec causa est quod `Benjamin' repraesentet 
medium conjungens et quoque verum novum, verum {2}novum cum apud patrem suum, medium conjungens cum apud Josephum. Hoc est arcanum {3}quod clarius exponi nequit, sed intelligi non potest nisi ab illis 
qui in {4}cognitione sunt quod apud hominem internum detur et externum inter se distincta, ut et qui simul in affectione sciendi vera sunt; hi illustrantur a luce caeli quoad partem intellectualem ut 
videant quod alii non vident, ita quoque hoc arcanum.(s) @1 Josephus repraesentat$ @2 conjungens I$ @3 d quod, i non$ @4 cogitatione I$ </p>
