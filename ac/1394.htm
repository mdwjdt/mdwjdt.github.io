<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1394节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1394.</strong>天使和灵人所具有的这种直觉能使他们中的任何人立刻知道别人爱与信的性质。正因如此，他们根据彼此的相似性而聚集成各个社群，根据其相异性从这类社群中退出。这种划分如此精细，以致最细微的差别都不能将他们凝聚起来，或将他们分开。所以，天堂的诸社群彼此区别如此显着，相互分离，以致无法想象还有比这区别更显着的了。这类区别取决于对主的爱与信的一切差别，这些差别数不胜数。天堂的形式就是这样产生的，其性质是它能显为一个人，并且该形式不断被完善。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1394.</strong> Since perception allows one person to see immediately what kind of love and belief another has, people come together in communities insofar as they harmonize, and separate insofar as they conflict. The process is so precise that not the smallest variation fails either to divide or to unite. As a result, communities in the heavens have distinctive characters — as distinct as anyone could possibly imagine. The differences depend on variations in love for the Lord and faith in him, which are countless. From this comes the form of heaven, which is such that it resembles a single human. That form is constantly being perfected. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1394</b></p><p><b>1394.</b>
It is owing to the existence of such perception as enables one to know in an instant what is the quality of another in respect to love and faith, that spirits and angels are joined together into societies 
in accordance with their agreement, and are separated from fellowship according to their disagreement; and this so exquisitely that there is not the smallest difference which does not dissociate 
or consociate. Hence the societies in the heavens are so distinct from one another that nothing can be conceived to be more so; and this in accordance with all the differences of love to the Lord, and 
of faith in Him, which cannot be numbered. Hence comes the form of heaven, which is such as to represent one man; and this form is continually being perfected. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1394</b></p><p><b>1394.</b>
The perception which angels and spirits have is such that any one of them can know in an instant the nature of the love and faith in another Hence it is that according to their similarity with one another 
they are joined together into communities, and according to their dissimilarity they are withheld from such associations. And this is so completely the case that not even the smallest difference 
fails to draw them together or to set them apart. Consequently the communities in heaven are so distinct and separate from one another that it is impossible to envisage anything more distinct, such distinctness 
being determined by all the differences of love to and faith in the Lord, which are countless. This is how the heavenly form is produced, the nature of which is such that it presents itself 
as one human being. And this form is constantly being perfected. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1394</b>
</p><b>1394.</b>
Quia talis perceptio est ut unus possit in instanti scire qualis alter est quoad amorem et fidem, inde est quod secundum consensum in societate conjungantur, et secundum dissensum dissocientur; et hoc 
tam exquisite ut ne minimum differentiae sit quod non dissociet aut consociet; inde societates in caelis tam distinctae sunt ut distinctius nihil cogitari possit et hoc secundum omnes differentias amoris 
et fidei in Dominum, quae innumerabiles sunt; inde forma caelestis, quae talis est ut unum hominem referat; quae forma continue perficitur. </p>
