<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1974节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1974.</strong>一番昏睡过后，一幅宜人的景象约在头更时分（大约19点至21点）出现了。青翠欲滴的月桂花环以极其优美的次序排列，而且还能活动，仿佛是活的。它们以这样的方式形成并优雅排列，以致其优美和谐，以及幸福的感觉从它们流出，非笔墨所能描述。它们排成双列，彼此间稍留空隙，并以不断变化的优美状态延伸了很长一段距离。灵人，甚至恶灵能清楚看到这幅景象。接着，另一幅景象出现了，其中蕴含天堂般的快乐。不过，它只是隐约可见。有些幼儿在玩天堂游戏，这些游戏以难以形容的方式感染心灵。<br />后来，我与灵人谈论这些景象。他们承认，第一幅景象，他们看得和我一样清楚，但第二幅景象却感觉十分模糊，以致他们分辨不出那是什么。因被告知天使和小孩子都看到了，他们感到愤慨，后来渐渐嫉妒起来。我得以用自己的感觉体验他们的嫉妒感，以致没什么东西能逃避我，因为它有助于我必须接受的教导。他们的嫉妒具有这样的性质：它不仅使他们极度烦恼，还使他们有痛苦和内在疼痛的感觉，而这仅仅因为他们看不到第二幅景象。结果，他们被引领经历各种嫉妒，直到他们体验到心脏区域的疼痛。<br />当他们处于这种状态时，我与他们谈论他们的嫉妒。我说，他们本来可以满足于看到第一个异象，若是善灵，也能看到第二个异象。但这却激起了他们的愤怒，加剧了他们的嫉妒，甚至到了一想起这事就感到痛苦的地步。其嫉妒的这些状态和发展，连同它的程度、加剧，以及思想和内心混杂的各种悲伤无法描述。以此向我显明，当恶者从远处看到善者的幸福，甚至仅仅想到它时，单单嫉妒就将他们折磨成什么样。</p>

After a troubled sleep, about the first watch, a very pleasant sight was presented. There were wreaths as of laurel, quite fresh, in most beautiful order, with motion as if alive: of such form and elegance 
of arrangement that description fails to express their beauty and harmony, and the affection of bliss that flowed forth from them. They were in a double series, at a little distance from each other, 
and running on together to a considerable length, and constantly varying the state of their beauty. This was plainly seen by spirits, even by evil ones. This was afterwards followed by another sight 
still more beautiful, in which there was heavenly happiness, but it was only dimly visible: there were infants in their heavenly sports, that affected the mind in a manner inexpressible.  [2] I 
afterwards spoke with spirits concerning these sights, who confessed that they saw the first as much as I did, but the second only so dimly that they could not tell what it was. This caused them to feel 
indignation, and afterwards by degrees envy, from the fact that it was said that angels and little children had seen it; and this envy of theirs it was given me to perceive sensibly, so that nothing 
escaped me so far as concerned my instruction. The envy was of such a nature as to cause in them not merely the utmost annoyance, but also a feeling of anguish and interior pain and this merely because 
they did not see the second vision also, and the consequence was that they were led through varieties of envy until they were in pain in the region of the heart.  [3] While they were in this state 
I spoke with them about the envy, telling them that they might be content with having seen the first vision, and that they would have been able to see the second also if they had been good; but this 
excited in them a feeling of indignation which intensified their envy, causing it to increase further to such a degree that they could not afterwards bear the least recollection of the matter without 
being affected with pain. The states and progressions of the envy, together with its degrees, aggravations, and varied and mingled distresses of mind and heart, cannot be described. It was thus shown 
how much the wicked are tormented by envy merely, when they see from afar the blessedness of the good, and even when they merely think of it. </p>

After troubled sleep a very lovely sight presented itself round about the first watch. There were wreaths as of laurel, green and fresh, placed in a very beautiful order, and moving as though they were 
alive. They were formed and arranged in such a way that their beauty and unity, and the feeling of bliss flowing from these, defy description. They ran in a double series spaced a little distant from 
each other and extended quite a long way with ever varying beauty. This was plainly seen by spirits, even by evil ones. Then another sight followed, which was still more beautiful, holding heavenly 
happiness within it; yet it was only dimly visible. Young children were playing heavenly games which filled the mind with feelings beyond description. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Subsequently I spoke to the spirits about 
those sights and they confessed that they had seen the first as clearly as I had done but not the second except so obscurely that they could not tell what it was. This gave rise to anger within them, 
and after that gradually to envy, when they were told that the angels and young children had seen it; and I was allowed to experience with my senses their feeling of envy so that nothing should escape 
me insofar as it contributed to what I had to learn about. Their envy was such that it not only caused them extreme annoyance but also agony and interior pain, and solely because they did not see the 
second sight as well as the first. They were consequently led through different kinds of envy until they experienced pain in the region of the heart. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 While they were passing through this state 
I talked to them about their envy. I said that they might have been contented with having seen the first vision, and that they could have seen the second as well if they had been good spirits. But this 
too merely roused their anger, which increased their envy to such an extent that after that they could not bear the faintest recollection of the experience without feeling pain. The states and the 
successive stages of their envy, together with the degrees of it, the increases in it, and the varied intermingled feelings of distress in mind and heart, are indescribable. In this way I was shown how 
much the wicked are tormented by envy alone when they see from afar the blessedness of the good, or indeed when they simply think about it. </p>

Post somnum molestum, circa primam vigiliam, sistebatur visum amoenissimum; erant serta sicut laurea, virentia, in pulcherrimo ordine, mobilia sicut viva, talis formae et concinnitatis ut describi nequeant 
ob pulchritudinem et harmoniam, et inde profluentem affectionem beatitudinis; erant duplici serie inter se paulum distante, satis in longum consociata, et jugiter statum pulchritudinis variantia: 
hoc perspicuum erat spiritibus, etiam malis.  Successit postea aliud visum adhuc pulchrius in quo felix caeleste, sed modo obscure visibile; erant infantes in ludis caelestibus, qui ineffabili modo 
afficiebant mentem.  [2] Postea de visis illis locutus cum spiritibus, qui fassi quod similiter mecum viderint primum, sed non alterum nisi ita obscure ut non potuissent dicere quid esset; inde indignatio 
apud eos orta, postea {1} per gradus invidia ex eo quia dictum quod angeli et infantes illud viderint; quam eorum invidiam sensibiliter dabatur percipere, sic ut nihil me fugeret quantum ad instructionem; 
invidia talis erat ut apud eos non solum causaretur summam molestiam sed etiam angorem et interiorem dolorem, ex causa solum quod non ii viderint etiam alterum; ducebantur inde per invidiae 
varietates usque ut dolerent {2} praecordiis: [3] cum in eo statu essent, locutus [sum] cum illis de invidia, quod contenti possent esse quod primum viderint, et quod etiam potuissent alterum si boni 
fuissent; inde quoque indignatio exasperabat invidiam, quae adhuc crevit usque ad eum gradum ut postea ne quidem sustinerent minimum recordationis ejus quin dolore afficerentur; status et processus 
invidiae cum ejus gradibus, incrementis, variatis et mixtis aegritudinibus animi et cordis, non describi possunt: ostensum sic quantum cruciantur impii ex sola invidia, cum beatitudinem bonorum e longinquo 
vident, immo dum solum de illa cogitant. 	@1 postmodum.$ 	@2 doleant.$ </p>
