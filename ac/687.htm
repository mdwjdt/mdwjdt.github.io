<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第687节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>687．这就是天堂的性质。天使或精灵若非生活在某个社群，从而与很多人和谐共处，就不会有任何生命。一个社群无非就是众多人的一种和谐关系，因为一个人的生命绝不可能与其他人的生命相隔绝。事实上，无论天使，精灵还是社群，若非通过自己社群里的多数人与天堂并精灵界相联，就不会有任何生命，也就是说，不会被良善驱使去意愿任何事物，或被真理驱使去思考任何事物。这同样适用于人类：若非以同样的方式通过与其同在的天使和天堂并精灵界相联，甚至通过与其同在的精灵和地狱相联，没人——无论他是谁，能够存活，即被良善驱使去意愿任何事物，或被真理驱使去思考任何事物。因为活在肉身的每个人都处于某个精灵和天使社群，尽管他丝毫未意识到它。<br />他若没有通过他所生活的社群与天堂并精灵界相联，则片刻不能存活。这就象人体的各个部位，人体的任何部分若不通过纤维和血管，因而通过各种功能与其余部分相联，就不是人体的一部分，而是作为无生命之物被立刻分离和排斥出去。<br />当世人进入来生（灵界）后，他活在肉身时所在并与其同在的那个社群会被展示给他。当结束肉身生活，进入自己的社群时，他们就会进入自己在肉身时所拥有的那种生活中，由此生命开始一个新的生活。根据其在肉身时所过的生活，他们或下入地狱，或被提升天堂。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]687.</strong> Since that is what heaven is like, no angel or spirit could ever have any life without being part of some community, without joining in harmony with many others. Community is simply harmony among many. No one's life is ever isolated from the life of others.<br />In fact no angel, spirit, or society could ever have any life — could ever be affected by good, form an intention, be affected by truth, form a thought — without a tight link to heaven and the world of spirits through other members of the group.<br />It is the same for the human race. Whoever we are, whatever we are like, we need the same kind of link to heaven through the angels with us, and to the world of spirits and even hell through the spirits with us. Otherwise we could never engage in life; we could never be affected by good or truth, never form an intention or thought. Everyone living in the body associates with some community of spirits and angels, despite being totally unaware of the fact. If we were not closely connected to heaven and the world of spirits through the spiritual society we associate with, we could not survive for a minute.<br />The situation resembles that in the human body. When any part of it lacks connection with the rest through nerve fibers and blood vessels and so lacks the means for performing its function, it ceases to be part of the body. Instead the body immediately isolates it and rejects it as being devoid of life.<br />When we come into the next life, we are shown the actual communities we lived in and associated with during bodily life. On entering that society after bodily life, we come into the selfsame life we lived while in the body, and on that life we build a new one. Depending on the life we carried out in the body, then, we either go down to hell or are raised into heaven. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 687</b></p><p><b>687.</b>
Such being the nature of heaven, no angel or spirit can have any life unless he is in some society, and thereby in a harmony of many. A society is nothing but a harmony of many, for no one has any life 
separate from the life of others. Indeed no angel, or spirit, or society can have any life (that is, be affected by good, exercise will, be affected by truth, or think), unless there is a conjunction 
thereof through many of his society with heaven and with the world of spirits. And it is the same with the human race: no man, no matter who and what he may be, can live (that is, be affected by good, 
exercise will, be affected by truth, or think), unless in like manner he is conjoined with heaven through the angels who are with him, and with the world of spirits, nay, with hell, through the spirits 
that are with him. For every man while living in the body is in some society of spirits and of angels, though entirely unaware of it. And if he were not conjoined with heaven and with the world 
of spirits through the society in which he is, he could not live a moment. The case in this respect is the same as it is with the human body, any portion of which that is not conjoined with the rest by 
means of fibers and vessels, and thus by means of functions, is not a part of the body, but is instantly separated and rejected, as having no vitality. The very societies in and with which men have 
been during the life of the body, are shown them when they come into the other life. And when, after the life of the body, they come into their society, they come into their veriest life which they had 
in the body, and from this life begin a new life; and so according to their life which they have lived in the body they either go down into hell, or are raised up into heaven. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 687</b></p><p><b>687.</b>
This being the nature of heaven, no angel or spirit can possibly have any life unless he lives in some community, and in so doing in a harmonious relationship of many people. A community is nothing else 
than the harmonious relationship of many, for one person's life in no sense exists in isolation from the life of others. Indeed no angel, spirit, or community can possibly have any life, that is, 
be moved by good to will anything, or be moved by truth to think anything, if he is not joined to heaven and to the world of spirits through the many in his own community. The same applies to the human 
race. No one whatever, no matter who, can possibly live, that is, be moved by good to will anything, or be moved by truth to think anything, unless he has in like manner been joined to heaven through 
the angels residing with him, and to the world of spirits, and even to hell through the spirits residing with him. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 For everyone during his lifetime is dwelling in some community of spirits or 
angels, although he is not conscious of doing so. And if he is not joined to heaven or the world of spirits by means of the community in which he lives, he cannot go on living one moment longer. It is 
like the parts of the human body. Any part of it which is not joined to the rest by means of fibres and vessels, and so by means of various functions, is not part of the body. It is instantly removed 
and expelled as that which has no life.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The very communities in which and among which people have lived during their lifetime are shown to them once they have entered the next life. When they 
enter such a community after the life of the body, they enter into the very life that had been theirs while in the body, and from that life they start a new one. And so according to the life they have 
led in the body they either go down to hell or are raised up to heaven.  </p>

</p><b>687.</b>
Quia tale est caelum, nusquam aliquis angelus aut spiritus aliquam vitam habere potest nisi sit in aliqua societate et sic in harmonia plurium; societas non est nisi harmonia plurium; nam nusquam datur 
vita alicujus dissociata a vita aliorum: immo nusquam angelus aut spiritus aut societas vitam aliquam habere potest, hoc est, affici bono, velle, affici vero, cogitare, nisi conjunctio ejus per plures 
suae societatis sit cum caelo et cum mundo spirituum: similiter genus humanum; homo quicumque et qualiscumque nusquam vivere potest, hoc est, affici bono, velle, affici vero, cogitare, nisi similiter 
conjunctus sit cum caelo per angelos apud eum, et cum mundo spirituum, immo cum inferno per spiritus apud eum; [2] nam quisque cum vivit in corpore in quadam societate spirituum et angelorum est, 
tametsi is id prorsus nescit; et nisi per societatem, in qua est, conjunctus sit cum caelo et cum mundo spirituum, ne minutum temporis vivere potest: se habet hoc sicut in corpore humano; quae pars ejus 
non conjuncta est reliquis per fibras et vasa, et sic per officiorum rationes, non est pars corporis, sed ilico dissociatur et ut nullius vitae rejicitur.  [3] Ipsae societates, in quibus et cum quibus 
homines fuerunt in vita corporis, iis ostensae sunt cum venerunt in alteram vitam; cum in illam societatem post vitam corporis veniunt, in ipsissimam suam vitam quam habuerunt in corpore, veniunt, 
et ab illa vita novam exordiuntur, et sic secundum vitam suam quam egerunt in corpore, vel descendunt ad infernum vel elevantur ad caelum. </p>
