<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7914节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7914.</strong>“你们要取出”表他们要强迫自己。这从“取出”的含义清楚可知，“取出”当论及那些属于属灵教会的人将要从主所接受的纯真良善时，是指强迫自己。纯真的良善，就是对主之爱的良善，不会被属于属灵教会的人接受，除非他强迫自己；因为他难以相信主是独一神，也难以相信祂的人身是神性。因此，他因缺少信，所以就不能处于对主之爱，从而不能处于纯真的良善，除非他强迫自己。人应当强迫自己，并且当他强迫自己时，便处在自由之中；但当被人强迫时，就不在自由之中（参看<a href="1937.htm">1937</a>，<a href="1947.htm">1947</a>节）。这就是“取出”也就是说，“取出”逾越节的动物所表示的。显而易见，“取出”这动物含有一个奥秘在里面，这奥秘并未显明在字义中。</p>

Draw ye forth. That this signifies that they should compel themselves, is evident from the signification of "drawing forth," when said of the good of innocence, which they who are of the spiritual church 
were to receive from the Lord, as being to compel themselves. For the good of innocence, which is the good of love to the Lord, is not received by the man of the spiritual church unless he compels 
himself; because it can with difficulty be believed by him that the Lord is the only God, and also that His Human is Divine; and therefore as he is not in faith, neither can be in love to Him, consequently 
not in the good of innocence, unless he compels himself. (That man ought to compel himself, and that when he compels himself it is from freedom, but not when he is compelled, see n. 1937, 1947.) 
This is signified by "drawing forth," namely the paschal animal. That to draw it forth involves some secret thing which does not appear in the sense of the letter, is manifest. </p>

'Draw out' means that they should compel themselves. This is clear from the meaning of 'drawing out', when used in reference to the good of innocence which those belonging to the spiritual Church are 
to receive, as compelling themselves. The good of innocence, which is the good of love to the Lord, is not received by one who belongs to the spiritual Church unless he exercises self-compulsion; for 
the belief that the Lord is the only God, and also that His Human is Divine, does not come easily to him. Therefore, since he is short of faith, no love to Him, or consequently any good of innocence, 
can be present in him unless he exercises self-compulsion The fact that a person ought to exercise self-compulsion, and that when he does he is in freedom but not when subject to compulsion from without, 
see <a href="1937.htm">1937</a>, <a href="1947.htm">1947</a>. This is what is meant by 'draw out', that is to say, the Passover animal. Drawing out that animal, it is self-evident, holds an arcanum within it that is not perceptible in the sense 
of the letter. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 7914</b>
</p><b>7914.</b>
`Protrahite': quod significet quod cogerent se, constat ex significatione `protrahere' cum dicitur de bono innocentiae quod recepturi a Domino illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, quod sit cogere se; bonum 
enim innocentiae, quod est bonum amoris in Dominum, ab homine spiritualis Ecclesiae non recipitur nisi cogat se, nam aegre ab illo credi potest quod Dominus sit solus Deus et quoque quod Humanum Ipsius 
Divinum sit; quare quia non in fide, nec in amore in Ipsum potest esse, consequenter non in bono innocentiae, nisi cogat se; (m)quod homo se cogere debeat, et cum ipse se cogit, sit ex libero, non 
autem cum cogitur, videatur n. 1937, 1947;(n) hoc significatur per `protrahite,' nempe pecudem paschalem; quod protrahere illam aliquod arcanum quod non exstat in sensu litterae involvat, patet. </p>
