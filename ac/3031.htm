<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3031节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3031.</strong>“我必须将你的儿子带回你原出之地吗”表它是否仍能与这神圣理性良善相结合。这从有关亚伯兰和他所出之地的阐述（参看<a href="1353.htm">1353</a>，<a href="1356.htm">1356</a>，<a href="1992.htm">1992</a>，<a href="2559.htm">2559</a>节）清楚可知。从这几节内容明显可知，亚伯兰所出之地是叙利亚，由希伯所建立的名为希伯来教会的第二代古教会就在那里（<a href="1238.htm">1238</a>，<a href="1241.htm">1241</a>，<a href="1327.htm">1327</a>，<a href="1343.htm">1343</a>节）。不过，约在亚伯兰时代，该教会也远离了真理，一些家庭甚至远离到完全不知道耶和华，反而敬拜别神的地步。这就是此处所指的地，对此，仆人问亚伯拉罕是不是要将他儿子带回他这原出之地。因此，“地”在此表示与真理不一致的情感。这就是“地”的含义，故将他们带回那里，或也可说，在那里给他娶一个妻子，并与这女人留在那里，就表示将一种与真理不一致的情感与这神圣理性良善联结起来。但正如下文亚伯拉罕的回答所声明的，这是不可能的。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3031</b></p><p><b>3031.</b>
Bringing shall I bring back thy son unto the land whence thou camest out? That this signifies a question whether it could nevertheless be conjoined with the Divine good of the rational, is evident from 
what was said above concerning Abraham, and concerning the land whence he came forth (see n. 1353, 1356, 1992, 2559); from which it is evident that the land whence Abram came was Syria, where was the 
second Ancient Church, called the Hebrew Church from Eber by whom it was established (n. 1238, 1241, 1327, 1343). But about the time of Abraham this church also fell away from the truth, and some of 
its households to such an extent that they were wholly ignorant of Jehovah, and worshiped other gods. This is the "land" here meant, and concerning which the servant asked Abraham whether he should 
bring back his son to the land whence he came out; and it is from this that by the "land" is here signified an affection which does not agree with truth. And because this is its meaning, by bringing back 
the son, or what is the same, by his marrying a woman there, and remaining there with her, is signified to conjoin an affection that does not agree with truth, with the Divine good of the rational. 
But that this could not be done is declared by Abraham's answer, the consideration of which now follows. </p>

'Must I take your son back to the land from which you came?' means whether it could nevertheless be joined to the Divine good of the Rational. This becomes clear from what has been stated already about 
Abram and about the land he came from, see <a href="1343.htm">1343</a>, <a href="1356.htm">1356</a>, <a href="1992.htm">1992</a>, <a href="2559.htm">2559</a>. From these paragraphs it is evident that the land from which Abram came was Syria, where the second Ancient Church existed, called 
the Hebrew Church after its founder Eber, <a href="1238.htm">1238</a>, <a href="1241.htm">1241</a>, <a href="1327.htm">1327</a>, <a href="1343.htm">1343</a>. But around the time of Abram this Church too had fallen away from the truth, some households so far away from it that they did not know 
Jehovah at all but worshipped other gods. This is the land which is meant here and to which the servant was referring when he asked whether he was required to take Abraham's son 'to the land from which 
you came'. Consequently 'the land' here means an affection which is not compatible with truth. This being the meaning of 'the land', 'taking his son there', or what amounts to the same, taking a 
woman for him and remaining with her there, means joining an affection incompatible with truth to the Divine good of the Rational. But this could not be done, as Abraham declares in his reply which follows. </p>

`An reducendo reducam filium tuum ad terram unde exivisti?' quod significet, num usque conjungi posset bono Divino Rationalis, constare potest ab illis quae prius de Abramo et de terra unde exivit, 
dicta sunt, videatur n. 1343, 1356, 1992, 2559, ex quibus patet quod terra unde Abram, esset Syria, ubi altera Ecclesia Antiqua quae dicta fuit Hebraea ab Ebero instauratore ejus, n. 1238, 1241, 1327, 
1343; sed Ecclesia haec circa {1}Abrahami tempus etiam descivit a vero, et quaedam ibi domus in tantum ut nesciverint prorsus Jehovam, et coluerint alios deos; haec terra est quae hic intelligitur, de 
qua servus quaesivit `an reduceret filium ad terram unde exivisti,' inde est quod per `terram' hic significetur affectio quae non concordat cum vero; et quia hoc, per `reducere filium {2},' seu quod 
idem, ibi accipere ei mulierem et ibi cum illa manere, significatur conjungere affectionem non concordantem vero cum bono Divino Rationalis; at quod hoc fieri non posset, {3}declarat Abrahami responsum, 
de quo sequitur. @1 Abrami$  @2 i illuc$  @3 declaratur a responso Abrahami$  </p>
