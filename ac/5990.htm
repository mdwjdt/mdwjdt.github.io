<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5990节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5990.</strong>有许多灵人不但想流入人的思维和情感，还想流入他的言语和思维，因而也流入他的思维和情感的身体对应物，或说流入他的身体事物。然而，这些身体对应物，或说身体事物并不受灵人和天使的具体流注影响，而是受总体流注控制。换句话说，当思维传送并被导入言语，意愿的渴望传送并被导入行为时，进入身体的这种导入和传送是照次序进行的，而不是通过某个特定灵人来控制。因为流入人的身体事物就是迷附他。渴望并企图这样做的灵人包括那些活在肉身期间就是奸淫者，也就是说，以奸淫为乐，并确信这种行为是可允许的人，还包括那些残暴的人。奸淫者和残暴者之所以渴望并企图迷附一个人，是因为他们比所有人都更肉体化和感官化，并通过将一切都归于自然界，丝毫不归于神性而弃绝关于天堂的一切思维。他们就这样向自己关闭了内层事物，打开了外在事物；他们因在世时只爱这些外在事物，所以在来世渴望迷附一个人，通过他回到它们当中。<br />但主规定，这类灵人不可进入灵人界；他们被关在自己的地狱，并且关得很严实。这解释了为何如今没有外在的迷附；但仍有内在的迷附，以及地狱和魔鬼团伙的作为。因为恶人会思想污秽的事，以及残暴对待他人的事，还有那些对神性之物不利和有害的事。这类思维若非因害怕失去地位、物质利益，和由此而来的名声，害怕法律的制裁，或丧失生命而受到抑制，就会公然爆发出来，这种人比那些迷附人的人更会陷入对他人的毁灭和对信之事物的亵渎。不过，这些外在约束使得他们似乎不受迷附；然而，就其内层而言，他们被迷附了，尽管就其外层而言，似乎没有被迷附。这一点从来世像他们那样的人很明显地看出来，在来世，外在约束都被除去。在那里，他们就是魔鬼，不断陷入毁灭他人、摧毁凡属于信之物的快乐和渴望中。</p>

There are very many spirits at this day who desire to flow not only into man's thoughts and affections, but also into his speech and actions, thus even into the things of his body; when yet the things 
of the body are exempt from the particular influx of spirits and angels, and are directed by general influx. In other words, when what is thought is determined into speech, and what is willed is determined 
into acts, the determination and transition into the body are according to order, and are not directed by any spirits in particular; for to flow into man's bodily things is to obsess him. The 
spirits who will and intend this are those who in the life of the body had been adulterers, that is, who had perceived delight in adulteries and had persuaded themselves that they are allowable; and also 
those who had been cruel. The reason is that both the former and the latter are more corporeal and sensual than all others, and have rejected all thought about heaven, attributing all things to nature 
and nothing to the Divine. In this way they have closed up interior things against themselves, and have opened external things; and because in the world they had been solely in the love of these, 
therefore in the other life they long to return into them through man by obsessing him. [2] But it is provided by the Lord that such infernals should not come into the world of spirits; they being kept 
in their hells, well shut up. Therefore there are no external obsessions at this day, but still there are internal ones, also the work of the infernal and diabolical crew; for evil men think such 
things as are filthy and also cruel towards others, and also such as are adverse and malignant toward what is Divine; and unless such thoughts were kept in check by fear of the loss of honor, of gain, 
and of reputation on account of these, of legal penalties, and of the loss of life, they would burst forth openly, and thus such men would rush more than the obsessed into the destruction of others, 
and into blasphemies against the things of faith. But these external bonds cause them not to seem to be obsessed, although they are so as to their interiors, but not as to their exteriors. This is very 
manifest from such as they in the other life, where external bonds are removed. There they are devils, being continually in the delight and desire of ruining others and destroying whatever is of faith. </p>

At the present day there are very many spirits who wish to enter not only a person's thoughts and affections but also his speech and actions, thus the bodily counterparts of his thoughts and affections 
as well. Those bodily counterparts however are not subject to particular influx from spirits and angels but are controlled by general influx. That is to say, when thoughts pass into and are channeled 
into speech and when the desires of the will pass into and are channeled into actions, their channeling and passage into the body takes place according to order, and is not controlled by means of any 
spirits in particular. For to enter a person's bodily aspects is to possess him. Spirits who have the desire and intention to do this include those who during their lifetime were adulterers, that is, 
who took delight in acts of adultery and convinced themselves that such acts were permissible. Also included are those who were cruel people. The reason why both the adulterous and the cruel have that 
desire and intention to possess a person is that they more than all others are governed by the body and the senses. They have cast aside all thought about heaven, by attributing everything to natural 
forces and nothing to the Divine. Thus they have shut interior things off from themselves and opened up external ones, for which alone they had any love while in the world and to which they therefore 
desire to return in the next life through a person by taking possession of him.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But the Lord makes provision which prevents such spirits from entering the world of spirits; they are confined 
to their own hells, shut well away. This explains why there are no cases of external possession at the present day; but there are nevertheless internal cases of it, also brought about by the hellish 
and devilish crew. For evil persons think the kinds of things that are filthy, also those which involve cruelty to others, as well as those that are contrary and harmful to Divine ones. Unless such 
thoughts were curbed by fear of the loss of position, material gain, reputation on account of such position and gain, fear of punishment by the law, or loss of life, they would break out into the open 
and such persons would plunge, more than those who are possessed, into the ruination of others and into blasphemous utterances made against matters of faith. But those external restraints make such people 
seem not to be possessed; they are however subject inwardly to such possession, even though they may not be outwardly. This is plainly evident from people like them in the next life, where external 
restraints are removed. There they are devils, constantly delighting in and desiring the ruination of others and the destruction of anything that is a matter of faith. </p>

Sunt hodie perplures spiritus qui non solum influere volunt in hominis cogitationes et affectiones sed etiam in loquelam et actiones, ita quoque in ejus corporea; cum tamen {1}corporea ab influxu particulari 
spirituum et angelorum exempta sunt, {2}et reguntur per influxum communem, (m)nempe cum cogitata in loquelam, et voluntaria in actiones determinantur, {3}determinatio et transitio in corpus 
est secundum ordinem, et non regitur per aliquos spiritus in particulari; nam (n) in corporea hominis influere, est illum obsidere: spiritus qui hoc volunt et intendunt, sunt qui in vita corporis fuerant 
adulteri, hoc est, qui jucundum in adulteriis perceperunt, ac {4}sibi persuaserunt quod licita essent; tum quoque illi qui fuerunt crudeles; causa est quia {5}illi et hi prae ceteris sunt corporei 
et sensuales, et a se rejecerunt omnem cogitationem de caelo, tribuendo omnia naturae ac nihil Divino; ita clauserunt sibi interiora, et aperuerunt externa, in quorum solo amore quia fuerunt in mundo, 
[2]ideo in altera vita in desiderio sunt redeundi in illa per hominem, obsidendo illum; sed providetur a Domino ne tales in mundum spirituum veniant, detinentur in infernis suis bene clausi; inde nullae 
obsessiones externae hodie; sed usque sunt {6}internae, etiam ab infernali et diabolica turba, cogitant enim mali homines talia quae spurca sunt, et quoque {7} crudelia contra alios, (m){8}tum adversa 
et maligna contra Divina;(n) quae cogitationes nisi coercerentur per timorem jacturae honoris, lucri, famae propter illa, poenae ex lege, et vitae, aperte erumperent, et sic tales ruerent plus quam 
obsessi in aliorum pernicies, et in blasphemias contra illa quae fidei sunt; sed vincula illa externa faciunt ut non obsessi videantur, cum tamen quoad interiora, non autem quoad exteriora sunt; (m)quod 
manifeste patet a talibus in altera vita, {9}ubi vincula externa auferuntur, {10}ibi sunt diaboli, continue in (t)jucundo et cupido perdendi alios, (c)et destruendi quicquid est fidei.(n) @1 haec$ @2
