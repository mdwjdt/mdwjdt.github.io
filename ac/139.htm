<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第139节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>139.</strong>古时，接受主引导的属天之人被称为“独居的”，因为他们不再为诸恶或恶灵所侵扰。在犹太教中，当他们逐出万民后，其“独居”即是象征这一点。因此，在圣经中，主的教会有时被称为“独居的”，例如：“迦勒底人哪，起来，上安逸无虑的居民那里去。他们是无门无闩，独自居住的。”（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.31.htm">49:31</a>）摩西预言说：“以色列要安然独居。”（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.28.htm">33:28</a>）巴兰的预言更为明确：“看哪，这是独居的民，不列在万民中。”（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.9.htm">23:9</a>）在此，“万民”表诸恶。<br />上古教会的后代不愿独居，亦即不愿成为属天之人，不愿像属天之人那样接受主的引导，却希望进入万民中，像犹太教那样。故经上说：“那人独居不好”，因为有此欲望的人已经落入恶中，主于是许了他。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]139.</strong> The ancients described people who were led by the Lord (the way people of heavenly character are) as living alone because evil or rather evil spirits no longer bothered them. In the Jewish church, the same circumstances were represented by the promise that when the other nations had been driven out they would live alone. For this reason the Word predicts several times that the Lord's church would be alone. An example from Jeremiah:<br />Rise, go up to a nation at rest, living securely. No double doors, no bar on the gate do they have; they live alone. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_139/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_49_31" target=_top>Jeremiah 49:31</a>)<br />In a prophecy of Moses':<br />Israel has lived securely, alone. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_139/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_33_28" target=_top>Deuteronomy 33:28</a>)<br />Still more explicitly in Balaam's prophecy:<br />Look, a people that lives alone and is not counted among the nations! (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_139/bible_king-james-version_numbers_23_9" target=_top>Numbers 23:9</a>)<br />Here the nations stand for different kinds of evil.<br />The generation that inherited the earliest church did not wish to live alone or, what is the same, to be heavenly or, again, to be led by the Lord as a heavenly individual. They wanted to be in among the nations, as the Jewish church was. Since this was what they wanted, the verse says that it was not good for the human to be alone. Those who yearn for evil are already involved in it, and they are allowed to have it. </p>

In ancient times those were said to "dwell alone" who were under the Lord's guidance as celestial men, because such were no longer infested by evils, or evil spirits. This was represented in the Jewish 
Church also by their dwelling alone when they had driven out the nations. On this account it is sometimes said of the Lord's church, in the Word, that she is "alone" as in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Arise, get 
you up to a quiet nation that dwelleth confidently, saith the Lord, which hath neither gates nor bar; they dwell alone (Jer. 49:31). In the prophecy of Moses:  Israel hath dwelt confidently alone (Deut. 
33:28). And still more clearly in the prophecy of Balaam: </p>
<p>     Lo, the people dwelleth alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations (Num. 23:9), where "nations" signify evils. This posterity 
of the Most Ancient Church was not disposed to dwell alone, that is, to be a celestial man, or to be led by the Lord as a celestial man, but, like the Jewish Church, desired to be among the nations. 
And because they desired this, it is said, "it is not good that the man should be alone" for he who desires is already in evil, and it is granted him. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 139</b></p><p><b>139.</b>
In ancient times those who were guided as celestial people by the Lord were said 'to dwell alone', for the reason that evil forces, or evil spirits, were infesting them no longer. This was also represented 
in the Jewish Church by their dwelling alone after the nations had been driven out. For this reason several times in the Word the Lord's Church is described as 'alone', as in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Rise 
up, go up against a nation at ease that dwells securely. It has no gates or bars; they dwell alone. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2049:31&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 49:31</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the prophecy of Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
Israel dwelt securely, alone. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2033:28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 33:28</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And plainer 
still in Balaam's prophecy,  </p>
<blockquote>
See, a people, it dwells alone, and is not reckoned among the nations. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2023:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 23:9</a>.   
</blockquote>
Here 'nations' stands for evils. These descendants of the Most Ancient Church 
did not wish to dwell alone; they did not wish to be a celestial man, that is, to be guided as a celestial man by the Lord, but to be among the nations, as also did the Jewish Church. And since this was 
what they desired it is said, 'It is not good that the man should be alone'. Indeed when this is what a person desires, he is already under the influence of evil, and his wish is granted.  </p>

</p><b>139.</b>
Antiquitus soli habitare dicti sunt qui a Domino ducti sicut homines caelestes, quia non amplius infestabant illos mala seu mali spiritus; repraesentatum hoc quoque in Ecclesia Judaica per id quod expulsis 
gentibus soli habitarent; quare aliquoties in Verbo praedicatur de Ecclesia Domini quod sola, ut apud Jeremiam, 	Surgite, ascendite ad gentem quietam, habitantem confidenter,...non valvae, et 
non vectis ei, solus{1} habitant, xlix 31: </p>
<p>in prophetia Mosis, 	Habitavit Israel confidenter, solus, Deut. xxxiii 28:  manifestius adhuc in prophetia Bileami, 	En populum, solus habitat, et inter 
gentes non reputatur, Num. xxiii 9; </p>
<p>ubi 'gentes' pro malis. Haec posteritas Antiquissimae Ecclesiae non habitare voluit sola, hoc est, non esse caelestis homo seu ut caelestis homo duci a Domino, sed 
inter gentes esse, sicut Ecclesia Judaica; et quia id cupivit, dicitur 'non bonam esse, ut sit homo solus is'; qui enim cupit, jamdum in malo est, et ei conceditur. @	1 Heb.  (badad)='in separation, 
separately,' and is used adverbally. S. here uses the simple form of the adjective, though we should have expected solum. In n. 9496 he uses solitarii, as Sch. does.$
