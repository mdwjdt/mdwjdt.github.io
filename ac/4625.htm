<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4625节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4625.</strong>不过，构成整个天堂，也就是大人的社群非常众多；有的更普遍，有的不怎么普遍。更普遍的，是与一个完整的肢体、器官或内脏相对应的社群；不怎么普遍的，是与它们的各个部分，或部分的部分相对应的社群。每个社群都是整体的一个形像，因为一个和谐的整体，是由和所构成的部分一样多的它自身的形像构成的。更普遍的社群因是大人的形像，故拥有以同样的方式相对应的个体社群在里面。我有时与那些在我被差往的社群，属于肺、心、脸、舌、耳、眼等区域的人交谈，也与那些属于鼻孔区域的人交谈。我由此得以知道他们是哪种人，也就是说，他们是“觉知”；因为他们都拥有对发生在他们社群的一切事的一种总体觉知，只是在细节上不那么像那些在眼睛区域之人的。这是因为，在眼睛区域的人会辨别并仔细检查那些属于觉知的事物。我还蒙允许观察前者的觉知能力如何照着他们所在社群的总体状态变化而变化。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4625</b></p><p><b>4625.</b>
But the societies of which the whole heaven (that is, the Grand Man) consists, are very numerous, and are more or less universal. The more universal are those to which an entire member, organ, or viscus, 
corresponds; and the less universal are those to which their parts, or parts of parts, correspond. Every society is an image of the whole, for that which is unanimous is composed of so many images 
of itself. As the more universal societies are images of the Grand Man, they have within them particular societies which correspond in a similar manner. I have sometimes spoken with those who in the 
society into which I was sent, belonged to the province of the lungs, of the heart, the face, the tongue, the ear, the eye, and also with those who belonged to the province of the nostrils, from which 
last it was also given me to know their character, namely, that they are perceptions, for they had a general perception of whatever happened in the society, but not so much in particular as have those 
who are in the province of the eye, for the latter discriminate and view those things which are matters of perception. It was further given me to observe that the perceptive power of the former varies 
in accordance with the general changes of state in the society in which they are. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4625</b></p><p><b>4625.</b>
But the communities that make up the whole of heaven, which is the Grand Man, are many, some being more universal ones, others less so. The more universal are those to which an entire member, organ, 
or vital part corresponds, the less universal those to which the parts of these and the parts of those parts do so. Each community is an image of the whole, for that which is a harmonious whole is made 
up of as many images of itself as constituent parts. Being images of the Grand Man these more universal communities have individual ones within them, which in a similar way correspond. I have on occasions 
talked to those who, in the community to which I was sent, belonged to the province of the lungs, the heart, the face, the tongue, the ear, or the eye, as well as to those who belonged to the province 
of the nostrils. From this I was given to know what kind of people they were, namely 'perceptions'; for they saw with perception whatever took place within their community, though that perception 
was of a more general kind and not so specific as that of those in the province of the eye. This was because those in the province of the eye discriminate and carefully examine matters of perception. 
I have also been allowed to see how their ability to perceive varies in keeping with the general changes of state of the community which they are part of. </p>

Sed societates ex quibus totum caelum quod est Maximus Homo, consistit, sunt plures, et sunt magis et minus universales; magis universales sunt quibus integrum membrum, aut organum, aut viscus correspondet; 
minus universales quibus partes eorum, et partium partes: unaquaevis societas est imago totius, nam quod unanimum est, ex totidem sui imaginibus componitur: societates illae magis universales, 
quia sunt imagines Maximi, habent societates particulares intra se quae similiter correspondent: locutus sum quandoque eum illis qui in societate in quam missus, pertinebant ad provinciam pulmonum, 
cordis, faciei, linguae, auris, oculi, et cum illis qui ad provinciam narium, ex quibus etiam scire datum quales sunt, quod nempe sint `perceptiones'; perceperunt enim quicquid in societate 
contigit in communi, non autem ita in particulari sicut illi qui in provincia oculi sunt, hi enim discernunt et intuentur illa quae perceptionis sunt: et quoque observare datum {1} quod perceptivum 
eorum varietur secundum status mutationes communes societatis in qua sunt.      @1 at$ </p>
