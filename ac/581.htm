<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>581.</strong>“伟人”是指那些由于认定自己高尚优越而无视一切神圣和真实之物的人，这一点从上下文清楚可知，也就是说，他们将信的教义事项浸没于自己的恶欲，即“神的众子和人的众女交合生子”所示之义。有关自我及其幻想的信念也随着所进入的事物增多而日益增长，直到最后这信念再也抹不掉。当信的教义事项也增添时，彻底信服的设想致使他们无视一切神圣与真实之物，他们成了伟人。如前所述，生活在大洪水前的这个种族就是如此，所有精灵都会被他们极其可怕的幻想窒息而死，这幻想从他们那里发出来，就象一个有毒、憋闷的气场。众精灵会被他们窒息而死，以至于不知如何思考，结果感觉半死不活。若非主通过降世使灵界摆脱这恶毒种族的束缚，没人能存在于灵界，主藉由精灵所统管的人类也将灭亡。这些人现被关押在地狱中好象被雾笼罩的坚硬岩石下面，在左脚的脚跟下方，他们也从未试图逃跑出来。灵界由此摆脱了这帮极其危险的团伙。对于该团伙，以及从它发出的最恶毒的气场，蒙主慈悲，容后再述。这些就是被称为伟人的人，他们无视一切神圣与真实之物。<br />圣言中进一步提到了他们，尽管他们的后代被叫做亚纳人和利乏音人。他们被叫做亚纳人的事实在摩西五经中清晰可见：<br />迦南地的探子说，我们在那里看见伟人，亚衲人的众子，就是伟人的后代；我们看自己好像是蚱蜢；在他们看来，我们也是这样。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民13.33.htm">13:33</a>）<br />他们被叫做利乏音人的事实可再次从摩西五经中清楚看出：<br />先前，有以米人住在摩押陆地，民数众多，身体高大，像亚衲人一样。这利乏音人也算为亚衲人，摩押人称他们为以米人。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申2.10.htm">2:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申2.11.htm">11</a>）<br />这里没有再提及伟人，但利乏音人就是。在先知书中，对他们的描述符合前面有关他们的介绍，如以赛亚书：<br />你下到阴间，阴间就因你震动，来迎接你。又因你惊动利乏音人。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.9.htm">14:9</a>）<br />这是指这类人所在的地狱。以赛亚书：<br />他们死了，必不能再活；利乏音人必不能再起。因为你巡视他们，毁灭他们，抹除他们全部记忆。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛26.14.htm">26:14</a>）<br />这也是指他们的地狱所在，他们由此永不再兴起。以赛亚书：<br />你的死人要复活，我的尸首要再度兴起。睡在尘埃的啊，要醒起歌唱！因你的甘露好像菜蔬上的甘露。但你要漂流在利乏音人的陆地上。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛26.19.htm">26:19</a>）<br />“利乏音人的陆地”就是上面所说的地狱。诗篇：<br />你岂要行奇事给死人看吗？难道利乏音人还能起来称赞你吗？（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗88.10.htm">88:10</a>）<br />这同样是指利乏音人的地狱，他们无法兴起，用其信念的可怕毒药骚扰灵界气场。但主已命定，人类必不再充满这类可怖的幻想和信念。大洪水前的人就具有这种秉性和天赋，致使他们沉浸其中，至于原因，如今仍不为人知，对此，蒙主慈悲，容后再述。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]581.</strong> The symbolism of the Nephilim as those who placed no value on anything holy or true because of delusions about their own importance and superiority can be seen from what appears above and just below. Specifically, it says that they merged doctrinal teachings with their appetites — the symbolic meaning of the two statements that the sons of God went in to the daughters of humankind and that they bore children to them.<br />People's delusions about themselves and their fantasies grow as they amass more and more contributing arguments, until finally those delusions become permanent. And when they drag religious teachings in, they develop the most rigid point of view, which causes them to completely discount the value of anything holy or true, making themselves into Nephilim.<br />That tribe of people, who lived before the Flood, is such as described above [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_581/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_562" target=_top>562-563</a>]; every spirit they meet, no matter who, they choke to death with the most horrendous delusions, which flood out from them like a poisonous, suffocating fog. They strangle those spirits so effectively that the spirits forget how to think, and seem to themselves to be half dead.<br />Had the Lord by his coming into the world not freed the world of spirits from such a venomous tribe as that, not a single spirit could have survived there. This would have meant the end of the human race, which the Lord governs through spirits. As a result, they now are kept in a hell below a kind of boulder, massive and shrouded in mist, under the heel of the left foot.{*1} They make no attempt to rise up out of the place, leaving the world of spirits free of their extremely hostile crowd. This crowd and the toxic effect of their persuasions will be spoken of in another place [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_581/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1265" target=_top>1265-1272</a>], the Lord in his divine mercy allowing.<br />These are the ones called Nephilim, who place no value on anything holy or true.<br />[2] Though the Word does call them Nephilim, it refers to their descendants as Anakim and Rephaim.{*2} The following passage in Moses shows that they are called Anakim:<br />Those who scouted out the land of Canaan said, "There we saw the Nephilim, the children of Anak from among the Nephilim, and in our eyes we were like locusts, and we were the same in their eyes." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_581/bible_king-james-version_numbers_13_33" target=_top>Numbers 13:33</a>)<br />Moses also shows that they were called Rephaim:<br />The Emim previously lived in the land of Moab, a people large and numerous and tall, like the Anakim. They themselves were accounted as Rephaim, like the Anakim, and the Moabites call them Emim. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_581/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_2_10-11" target=_top>Deuteronomy 2:10-11</a>)<br />The Nephilim are not mentioned anywhere else, but the Rephaim are, and the prophets describe them in the same way. Isaiah says:<br />Hell was disquieted below for you, coming to meet you; it stirred up the Rephaim for you. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_581/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_14_9" target=_top>Isaiah 14:9</a>)<br />This is about hell, where such people are. In the same author:<br />The dead will not live, the Rephaim will not rise, because you inflicted punishment on them and destroyed them and wiped out all memory of them. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_581/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_26_14" target=_top>Isaiah 26:14</a>)<br />Here too the subject is their hell, from which they will no longer arise. Again in the same author:<br />Your dead will live, my corpse; they will rise again. Wake up and sing, you who live in the dirt, because your dew is the dew on the vegetation. But the land of the Rephaim you will cast out. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_581/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_26_19" target=_top>Isaiah 26:19</a>)<br />The land of the Rephaim is hell, which is what this verse describes. In David:<br />Will you do a miracle for the dead? Will the Rephaim arise, will they acclaim you? (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_581/bible_king-james-version_psalms_88_10" target=_top>Psalms 88:10</a>)<br />This likewise deals with their hell and the fact that they cannot rise up to poison the atmosphere in the world of spirits with their dreadful persuasions.<br />The Lord, however, provided that the human race would no longer steep itself in such appalling fantasies and delusions. The people who lived before the Flood had a nature and psyche that enabled them to absorb such twisted thinking. The reason is not yet known to anyone but will be divulged below [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_581/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_927" target=_top>927</a>], by the Lord's divine mercy.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg often describes position in the other world in relation to the human body.

That by the "Nephilim" are signified those who through a persuasion of their own loftiness and preeminence made light of all things holy and true, appears from what precedes and what follows, namely, 
that they immersed the doctrinals of faith in their cupidities, signified by the "sons of God going in unto the daughters of man, and their bearing unto them." Persuasion concerning self and its phantasies 
increases also according to the multitude of things that enter into it, till at length it becomes indelible; and when the doctrinals of faith are added thereto, then from principles of the strongest 
persuasion they make light of all things holy and true, and become "Nephilim." That race, which lived before the flood, is such that they so kill and suffocate all spirits by their most direful 
phantasies (which are poured forth by them as a poisonous and suffocating sphere) that the spirits are entirely deprived of the power of thinking, and feel half dead; and unless the Lord by His coming 
into the world had freed the world of spirits from that poisonous race, no one could have existed there, and consequently the human race, who are ruled by the Lord through spirits, would have perished. 
They are therefore now kept in a hell under as it were a misty and dense rock, under the heel of the left foot, nor do they make the slightest attempt to rise out of it. Thus is the world of spirits 
free from this most dangerous crew, concerning which and its most poisonous sphere of persuasions, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. These are they who are called "Nephilim" and who make light of 
all things holy and true. Further mention is made of them in the Word, but their descendants were called "Anakim" and "Rephaim." That they were called "Anakim" is evident from Moses: </p>
<p>     There we 
saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, of the Nephilim, and we were in our own eyes as grasshoppers, and so we were in their eyes (Num. 13:33). That they were called "Rephaim" appears also from Moses: </p>
<p> 
    The Emim dwelt before in the land of Moab, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim, who also were accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim, and the Moabites call them Emim (Deut. 2:10-11). The 
Nephilim are not mentioned anymore, but the Rephaim are, who are described by the prophets to be such as are above stated; as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Hell low down has been in commotion for thee, to meet thee 
in coming, it hath stirred up the Rephaim for thee (Isa. 14:9), speaking of the hell which is the abode of such spirits. In the same: </p>
<p>     Thy dead shall not live, the Rephaim shall not arise, because 
thou hast visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish (Isa. 26:14), where also their hell is referred to, from which they shall no more rise again. In the same: </p>
<p>Thy dead shall 
live, my corpse, they shall rise again; awake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust, for the dew of herbs is thy dew; but thou shalt cast out the land of the Rephaim (Isa. 26:19); </p>
<p>"the land of the 
Rephaim" is the hell above spoken of. In David: </p>
<p>     Wilt Thou show a wonder to the dead? Shall the Rephaim arise, shall they confess to Thee? (Ps. 88:10),  speaking in like manner concerning the hell 
of the Rephaim, and that they cannot rise up and infest the sphere of the world of spirits with the very direful poison of their persuasions. But it has been provided by the Lord that mankind should 
no longer become imbued with such dreadful phantasies and persuasions. Those who lived before the flood were of such a nature and genius that they could be imbued, for a reason as yet unknown, concerning 
which, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 581</b></p><p><b>581.</b>
That 'the Nephilim' means those who, persuaded of their own prominence and superiority, treated everything holy and true as being worthless is clear from what comes before and directly after; that is 
to say, they immersed matters of doctrine in their own evil desires, which is what is meant by the statement about the sons of God going in to the daughters of man, who bore children to them. Persuasion 
concerning self and its own delusions also grows as more and more things enter in, till at length that persuasion is inerasable. And when doctrinal matters concerning faith are added as well, utterly 
persuasive assumptions cause them to treat everything holy and true as being worthless, and they become Nephilim. As has been stated, this set of people who lived before the Flood are such that all 
spirits are choked to death by their absolutely dreadful delusions which spread from them like a sphere that is poisonous and choking. Spirits are so choked to death by them that they do not know how 
to think, and as a result feel semi-dead. And unless the Lord by His Coming into the world had freed the world of spirits from so pernicious a set of people, no one could possibly have stayed on there, 
and so the human race, which the Lord governs by means of spirits, would have perished. Consequently these people are now detained in a hell beneath what looks like a misty solid rock, beneath the 
heel of the left foot. Nor do they ever try to escape. The world of spirits is accordingly free of that extremely dangerous crew. That crew and the thoroughly poisonous sphere of persuasions from it 
will in the Lord's Divine mercy be dealt with as a separate subject.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> These are the people called the Nephilim, and they treat all that is holy and true as being worthless.   </p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Further mention is 
made of them in the Word, though their descendants were called Anakim and Rephaim. The fact that they were called Anakim is clear in Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
The men who explored the land of Canaan said, We saw the 
Nephilim there, the sons of Anak who were descendants of the Nephilim; and in our own eyes we were like locusts, and so we were in their eyes. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2013:33&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 13:33</a>.   
</blockquote>
The fact that they were called Rephaim is 
clear once again in Moses,    The Emim lived formerly in the land of Moab, a people great and many, and tall like the Anakim. The Rephaim were also considered to be as Anakim; and the Moabites called 
them Emim. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%202:10,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 2:10, 11</a>.  </p>
<p>The Nephilim are not mentioned again, but the Rephaim are. In the Prophets the description of them fits what has been said about them already, as in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Hell 
beneath has been stirred up for you, to meet you as you come. He has roused the Rephaim for you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2014:9%20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 14:9 </a> 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the hell where such people are. In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
The dead will not 
live, the Rephaim will not rise. To that end You have visited and destroyed them, and wiped out all remembrance of them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2026:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 26:14</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This also refers to that hell of theirs from which they will 
never rise up again. And in the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
Your dead will live, my corpse will rise again. Wake up and sing, O inhabitants of the dust. For Your dew is a dew of herbs. But You will cast away the 
land of the Rephrim. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2026:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 26:19</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The land of the Rephaim' is that self same hell. In David,  </p>
<blockquote>
Will You work a wonder for the dead? Will the Repkaim rise up and confess You? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2088:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 88:10</a>.    
</blockquote>
This 
similarly refers to that hell of theirs and to the fact that they can never again rise up and contaminate the atmosphere of the world of spirits with the utterly dreadful poison of their persuasions. 
Provision has been made by the Lord however to prevent the human race ever again being steeped in such dreadful delusions and persuasions. But the people who lived before the Flood were of such a nature 
and disposition that they were able to be steeped in them, for reasons until now unknown to anybody, which too will in the Lord's Divine mercy be dealt with later on.

Quod per 'Nephilim' significentur qui ex persuasione suae altitudinis et praeeminentiae nihili fecerunt omnia sancta et vera, constat ex illis quae praecedunt et mox sequuntur; quod nempe immerserint
