<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3364节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3364.</strong>“在亚伯拉罕的日子，那地有一次饥荒；这时又有饥荒”表缺乏对信仰的认知。这从“饥荒”的含义清楚可知，“饥荒”是指缺乏认知（<a href="1460.htm">1460</a>节）。它在此是指缺乏对信仰的认知，这一点从接下来的内容，也就是亚比米勒的代表和“基拉耳”的含义明显看出来，“基拉耳”是指属于信的事物。亚伯拉罕日子的“饥荒”在12章（12:10）被提及，并在1460节给予解读，它表示缺乏属于属世人的认知，而此处提及的“饥荒”表缺乏属于理性人的认知。故经上说“在亚伯拉罕的日子，那地有一次饥荒；这时又有饥荒”。<br />就内义而言，此处所论述的主题是主，因为信的一切教义事物皆来自祂的神性；没有任何教义事物，哪怕最小的一部分，不是来自主，因为主是教义本身。这就是为何主被称为“圣言”，因为“圣言”是教义。由于主里面的一切事物都是神性，而神性无法被任何受造物所理解，故只要它们出现在受造物面前，来自主的教义事物就不是纯粹的神圣真理，而只是真理的表象。尽管如此，这类表象仍包含神圣真理在里面，并且因包含它们，故表象也被称为真理。这些表象就是本章所论述的主题。</p>

And there was a famine in the land, besides the former famine that was in the days of Abraham. That this signifies a lack of the knowledges of faith, is evident from the signification of "famine," as 
being a lack of knowledges (n. 1460). That it is a lack of the knowledges of faith, is evident from what presently follows, that is, from the representation of Abimelech, and from the signification of 
"Gerar," as being that which is of faith. The "famine" in the days of Abraham, mentioned in the twelfth chapter (verse 10), and explained above (n. 1460), denoted a lack of the knowledges which are 
of the natural man; but the "famine" here spoken of denotes a lack of the knowledges which are of the rational man; and therefore it is said that "there was a famine in the land, besides the former famine 
that was in the days of Abraham." In the internal sense the subject here treated of is the Lord, in that from His Divine are all the doctrinal things of faith; for there is no doctrinal thing, nor 
the smallest part of one, that is not from the Lord, because the Lord is doctrine itself. Hence it is that the Lord is called the "Word," because the "Word" is doctrine; but as everything that is in 
the Lord is Divine, and the Divine cannot be comprehended by any created being, therefore insofar as they appear before created beings, the doctrinal things that are from the Lord are not truths purely 
Divine, but are appearances of truth; nevertheless within such appearances there are truths Divine; and because they have these truths within them, the appearances also are called truths; and these 
are now treated of in this chapter. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3364</b></p><p><b>3364.</b>
'There was a famine in the land, in addition to the previous famine that occurred in the days of Abraham' means an absence of cognitions of faith. This is clear from the meaning of 'a famine' as an absence 
of cognitions, dealt with in <a href="1460.htm">1460</a>; and that an absence of cognitions of faith is meant is evident from what follows next - from the representation of 'Abimelech' and from the meaning of 'Gerar' 
as the things that belong to faith. 'The famine in the days of Abraham', which is mentioned in Chapter 12:10, and is dealt with in <a href="1460.htm">1460</a>, was an absence of cognitions that belong to the natural man, whereas 
the famine referred to here is an absence of cognitions that belong to the rational man. This is why it is said that 'there was a famine in the land, in addition to the previous famine that occurred 
in the days of Abraham'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The subject here in the internal sense is that the Lord received all matters of doctrine concerning faith from His own Divine; for no matter of doctrine exists, not 
even the smallest, that does not come from the Lord, for the Lord is doctrine itself. This is why the Lord is called the Word, for the Word is doctrine. But because everything in the Lord is Divine, 
and the Divine cannot be comprehended by any created being, matters of doctrine which come from the Lord, in that they present themselves before created beings, are not therefore wholly Divine truths 
but appearances of truth. All the same, appearances do include Divine truths within them, and because they include them, appearances also are called truths. These appearances are the subject in this chapter. </p>

`Fuit fames in terra praeter famem priorem {1}in diebus Abrahami': quod significet defectum cognitionum fidei, constat a significatione `famis' quod sit defectus cognitionum, de qua n. 1460; quod cognitionum 
fidei sit, patet a mox sequentibus, nempe a repraesentatione `Abimelechi' et a significatione `Geraris' quod sint illa quae fidei sunt; `fames in diebus Abrahami' quae memoratur cap. xii 10, 
et de qua n. 1460, fuit defectus cognitionum quae naturalis hominis, fames autem de qua hic, est defectus cognitionum quae sunt rationalis, quare dicitur, quod `fuit fames in terra praeter famem priorem 
quae fuit in diebus Abrahami.' [2] Agitur hic in sensu interno de Domino, quod ab Ipsius Divino omnia doctrinalia fidei; non enim datur aliquod doctrinale, ne quidem minimum ejus, quod non a Domino, 
nam Dominus est ipsa doctrina, inde est quod Dominus dicatur Verbum, {2}quia Verbum est doctrina: sed quia omne quod in Domino est Divinum, et Divinum non capi potest ab aliquo creato, ideo doctrinalia 
quae a Domino, quantum coram creatis apparent, non sunt vera pure Divina, sed sunt veri apparentiae; {3}at usque in apparentiis sunt Vera Divina; et quia haec in illis sunt, etiam apparentiae audiunt 
vera: de his nunc in hoc capite agitur. @1 i quae fuit$  @2 nam$  @3 sed$  </p>
