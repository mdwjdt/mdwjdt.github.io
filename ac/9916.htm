<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9916节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9916.</strong>“那口必有铠甲的领口，免得破裂”表因此，它被造得坚固而安全，免受损坏。这从“铠甲”的含义清楚可知。“铠甲”是指织得很坚固的某种事物；这就是为何经上说“免得破裂”，也就是说，为叫它能够安全，免受损坏。在原文，这个词表示织得很坚固的某种事物。从对应关系可以获得对这种织物的概念。此处在内义上的主题是属天良善进入属灵良善的流注；这种流注就是“为头留出的外袍领口”所表示的，也是“织工的手工”和“铠甲”所描述的。从一层天堂进入另一层天堂的这种流注就对应于人里面从头经由颈部进入身体的生命流注（<a href="9913.htm">9913</a>，<a href="9914.htm">9914</a>节）。因此，颈部强壮的肌腱网，以及颈部下面那一圈可以说交织在一起的骨头，就是使生命的流注保持安全，免受任何伤害的这二者对应于从一层天堂进入另一层天堂的这种流注。如前所述，从这种对应关系就能获得对本节经文细节的一个概念，也就是说，对在中间为头留出的领口，领口周围的领边，织工的手工，以及外袍必有、免得破裂的铠甲所表之物有一个概念。要记住，自然界中一切代表性的物体都以某种方式而与人的形式有关系，它们的含义也取决于这种关系（<a href="9496.htm">9496</a>节） 。所有遮身的衣服都从它所遮盖的身体部位取得自己的含义（<a href="9827.htm">9827</a>节）；这也适用于围住并遮盖颈部的这外袍的上面部分。</p>

As the mouth of a coat of mail it shall be, that it be not rent. That this signifies thus strong and safe from injury, is evident from the signification of "a coat of mail," as being what is strongly 
woven together; wherefore it is said, "that it be not rent," that is, that it be safe from injury. Something thus woven together is signified by this term in the original tongue. An idea of what is thus 
woven together can be had from correspondence; for in the internal sense there is here treated of the influx of celestial good into spiritual good. It is this influx which is signified by "the mouth 
of the head of the robe," and is described by "the work of the weaver," and "of a coat of mail;" and to this influx from the heavens corresponds in man the influx of life from the head through the 
neck into the body (n. 9913, 9914). And because to this influx corresponds the woven fabric of the neck which is of strong sinews; and lower down a kind of interwoven circle of bones; through both of 
which the influx is rendered safe from all injury, therefore, as before said, an idea can be had of the several expressions in this verse, namely, of what is signified by "the mouth of the head of the 
robe in the midst," by "the lip which is round about" it, by "the work of the weaver," and by "the mouth of the coat of mail" which it had, lest it should be rent. Be it known that all the representatives 
in nature bear relation to the human form, and have their signification according to this relation (n. 9496); and that all clothing derives its signification from that part of the body which it 
covers (n. 9827); consequently so also does this upper part of the robe which encompasses and covers the neck. </p>

'And the hole of a corslet it must have, so that it does not tear' means so that it has been made strong and safe from damage. This is clear from the meaning of 'a corslet' as something strongly woven; 
and this is why it says 'so that it does not tear', that is, in order that it may be safe from damage. Something strongly woven is meant by the actual word used in the original language. An idea of 
that kind of weaving may be gained from correspondence. The subject at this point in the internal sense is the flow of celestial good into spiritual good; this inflow is what is meant by 'the robe's 
hole for the head' and what is described by 'the work of a weaver' and 'of a corslet'. To this flow from one heaven into another the flow of life in the human being corresponds, that is, the flow from 
the head by way of the neck into the body, <a href="9913.htm">9913</a>, <a href="9914.htm">9914</a>. The network of strong sinews belonging to the neck, and the circle so to speak of interwoven bones below the neck, both of which keep the flow of 
life safe from any harm, therefore have correspondence with that flow from one heaven to another. From such correspondence, as has been stated, an idea may be gained regarding the details in this verse, 
that is to say, an idea of what is meant by a hole for the head in the middle, by a border which the hole has round about, by the work of a weaver, and by the hole of a corslet which the robe must 
have so that it does not tear. It should be remembered that all representative objects on the natural level are related in some way to the human form, and that their meaning is determined by that relationship, <a href="9496.htm">9496</a>. Every garment covering the body takes its meaning from that part of the body it serves to cover, <a href="9827.htm">9827</a>, as applies also to this upper part of the robe which encircles and covers the neck.  </p>

</p><b>9916.</b>
`Et os loricae erit illi ne laceretur': quod significet ita validum et tutum a damno, constat ex significatione `loricae' quod sit quod valide contextum, quare dicitur `ne laceretur,' hoc est, ut tutum 
sit a damno; tale contextum significatur per vocem illam in lingua originali.  Idea {1}istius contexti ex correspondentia haberi potest, agitur enim ibi in sensu interno de influxu boni caelestis 
in bonum spirituale; is influxus est qui significatur per `os capitis pallii' et describitur per opus textoris et loricae'; et influxui illi e caelis correspondet influxus vitae apud hominem a capite 
per collum in corpus, n. 9913, 9914; et quia sic ei correspondet textura colli ex nervis validis, et infra contextum quasi circulare {2} ex ossibus, per quae influxus tutus redditur ab omni damno; inde, 
ut dictum est, idea haberi potest de singulis in hoc versu, quid nempe significatur per os capitis in medio, per labrum quod ei circumcirca, per opus textoris, et per os loricae, quod ei, ne laceretur. 
 Sciendum {2} quod omnia repraesentativa in natura se referant ad formam humanam, et secundum relationem ad illam significent, n. 9496, {3}et quod omnia indumenta trahant significationem ab illa 
parte corporis quam tegunt, n. 9827; inde quoque superior haec pars pallii, quae circumdat et tegit collum. @1 illo$ @2 i etiam$ @3 ita quoque haec pars pallii, ad illa quae colli sunt, quod ambit 
et tegit$ </p>
