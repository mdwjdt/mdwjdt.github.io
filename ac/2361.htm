<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2361.</strong>创世记19:8.看哪，我有两个女儿，还没有亲近过男人，容我领她们出来给你们，就照你们看为好的对待她们吧！只是这两个人既然到我舍下，不要向他们作什么。<br />“看哪，我有两个女儿，还没有亲近过男人”表对善与真的情感。“容我领她们出来给你们”表由此而来的幸福。“就照你们看为好的对待她们吧”表照着他们出于良善接受它的程度而享受。“只是这两个人，不要向他们作什么”表他们不应向主的神圣人性和神圣活动施暴。“既然到我舍下”表他们具有仁之善，“舍下”表在一种（对那善）一般的模糊觉察内。</p>

Verse 8. Behold I pray I have two daughters who have not known man; let me I pray bring them out unto you, and ye may do unto them as is good in your eyes; only unto these men do not anything; for therefore 
are they come under the shadow of my roof. "Behold I pray I have two daughters who have not known man," signifies the affections of good and of truth; "let me I pray bring them out unto you," 
signifies blessedness therefrom; "and ye may do unto them as is good in your eyes," signifies enjoyment insofar as they perceived it to be from good; "only unto these men do not anything;" signifies that 
they should not do violence to the Lord's Divine Human and Holy proceeding; "for therefore are they come under the shadow of my roof," signifies that they are in the good of charity; the "shadow of 
the roof," denoting in his obscure general [perception] of it. </p>

Verse 8 Behold now, I have two daughters, who have not known a man; let me now bring them out to you and you may do to them as is good in your eyes; only do nothing to those men, for they have come under 
the shadow of my roof. </p>
<p>'Behold now, I have two daughters, who have not known a man' means the affections for good and for truth. 'Let me now bring them out to you' means blessedness from these. 
'And you may do to them as is good in your eyes' means enjoyment insofar as they perceived them to come from good. 'Only do nothing to those men' means that they were to do no violence to the Lord's 
Divine Human and His Holy proceeding. 'For they have come under the shadow of my roof' means that the good of charity exists with them, 'shadow of the roof' meaning within a general obscure [perception] 
of that good. </p>

Vers. 8.  Ecce quaeso mihi duae filiae, quae non cognoverunt virum, educam quaeso eas ad vos, et faciatis eis sicut bonum in oculi vestris, tantum viris illis ne faciatis quicquam, quia propterea venerunt 
in umbram trabis meae. `Ecce quaeso mihi duae filiae quae non cognoverunt virum' significat affectiones boni et veri: `educam quaeso eas ad vos' significat beatitudinem ex illis: `et faciatis eis 
sicut bonum in oculis vestris' significat fruitionem quantum perciperent ex bono: `tantum viris illis ne faciatis quicquam' significat quod non Divinum Humanum et Sanctum procedens Domini violarent: 
`quia propterea venerunt in umbram trabis meae' significat quod in bono charitatis sint; `umbra trabis' est in ejus communi obscuro. </p>
