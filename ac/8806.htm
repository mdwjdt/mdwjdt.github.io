<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8806节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8806.</strong>“叫百姓分别为圣”表遮盖那些人的内层，好叫他们能出现在信仰的圣洁中。这从前面的解释（<a href="8788.htm">8788</a>节）清楚可知。然而，那一段说明了以色列人当中的分别为圣是什么样子，即：遮盖他们的内层，是为了叫这些人在进行代表性敬拜时，他们的外在能出现在神圣之物中。那时，若非他们的内层已经被遮盖起来，他们不仅早就通过污秽的思维和邪恶的情感玷污了敬拜的神圣，还会完全摧毁它，并且毁得如此彻底，以至于无法从他们的敬拜中觉察到一丝表现在外在事物中的属天或属灵之物。<br />不过，由于“以色列人”在此表示那些属于属灵教会的人，所以有必要简短阐述一下当如何理解这些人当中的“分别为圣”。那些属于属灵教会，过着真理的生活，并由此过着良善生活的人被主阻离邪恶，保守在良善中。来自主的良善在他们那里是神圣的。因此，他们从主接受良善到何等程度，就在何等程度上是神圣的；他们从主接受多少良善，也就是多么神圣，取决于他们在多大程度上照纯正的信之真理过良善的生活，同时相信那时他们所思所行的一切良善皆来自主。当他们做这些事时，与他们同在的邪恶也就被分离出来，以至于根本不显现，尤其他们通过遗传从父母所获得的污秽邪恶，因为它们已经通过历代的父母累积了很多年，并因此在后代里面堆积起来。这些就是那些属于属灵教会的人被隐藏起来，可以说被遮盖起来的内层（<a href="966.htm">966</a>，<a href="1667.htm">1667</a>，<a href="2307.htm">2307</a>，<a href="2308.htm">2308</a>，<a href="3701.htm">3701</a>，<a href="4317.htm">4317</a>，<a href="8550.htm">8550</a>节）。正因如此，他们通过遗传所整个意愿都已经败坏。因此，他们拥有一个新意愿，这个新意愿是主通过信之真理在心智的理解力部分形成的。这解释了为何当正在重生时，他们通过真理被引向良善；后来当已经重生时，他们从良善被引入良善之真理。这清楚表明他们的新意愿是如何被主创造的。关于在那些属于属灵教会的人那里，这新意愿在心智的理解力部分中的形成，可参看前文（<a href="863.htm">863</a>，<a href="875.htm">875</a>，<a href="895.htm">895</a>，<a href="927.htm">927</a>，<a href="1023.htm">1023</a>，<a href="1043.htm">1043</a>，<a href="1044.htm">1044</a>，<a href="1555.htm">1555</a>，<a href="2256.htm">2256</a>，<a href="4328.htm">4328</a>，<a href="4493.htm">4493</a>，<a href="5113.htm">5113</a>，<a href="6125.htm">6125</a>节）。</p>

And sanctified the people. That this signifies the veiling over of the interiors that they may appear to be in the holiness of faith, is evident from what was unfolded above (n. 8788); but it was there 
set forth what was the sanctification with the Israelitish people, namely, that it was a veiling over of the interiors, so that as to their externals they might appear to be in what was holy when they 
were in representative worship; and that unless their interiors had then been veiled over, they would not only have defiled the holiness of worship by foul thoughts and evil affections, but would 
also have totally destroyed it, so that nothing celestial and spiritual which was represented in the external things would have been perceived therefrom in heaven. [2] But as by "the sons of Israel" 
are here meant those who are of the spiritual church, it shall be briefly told what is meant by "sanctification" with these. They who are of the spiritual church and live a life of truth and from this 
a life of good, are withheld from evils and are kept in good by the Lord. The good which is from the Lord is holy with them. Consequently insofar as they receive good from the Lord, so far they are holy; 
and they receive so much of good from the Lord, that is, are so far holy, as they live a life of good according to the genuine truths of faith, and at the same time believe that all the good which 
they then think and do is from the Lord. Then, too, evils with them are separated so as not to appear at all, especially those which they have derived hereditarily from parents, and which are filthy, 
because they have been successively accumulated with the parents for many ages back, and thus amassed in the offspring. These are the interiors which with those who are of the spiritual church are hid 
away and as it were veiled over (n. 966, 1667, 2307, 2308, 3701, 4317, 8550). Hence it is that all the will they possess hereditarily is destroyed. For this cause a new will is formed with them in 
the intellectual part by means of truths of faith from the Lord. This is the reason why, when they are being regenerated, they are led by means of truths to good; and afterward when they have been regenerated, 
from good into the truths of good. Hence it is evident how a new will is created in them by the Lord. (That this is formed in the intellectual part with those who are of the spiritual church, 
see n. 863, 875, 895, 927, 1023, 1043, 1044, 1555, 2256, 4328, 4493, 5113, 6125.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8806</b></p><p><b>8806.</b>
'And sanctified the people' means covering over their interiors in order that those people may appear in the holiness of faith. This is clear from the explanation above in <a href="8788.htm">8788</a>. That paragraph however 
showed what sanctification among the Israelite people was, namely a covering over of their interiors in order that those people might appear outwardly in holiness when they were involved in representative 
worship. And unless their interiors had been covered over then, foul thoughts and evil affections would have not merely defiled the holiness of their worship but also completely destroyed it, so 
completely that nothing celestial or spiritual, represented in externals, could have been perceived from it in heaven. </p>

 But since 'the children of Israel' is used here to mean those belonging 
to the spiritual Church, something brief will be stated about how to understand sanctification among those people. Those belonging to the spiritual Church, those who lead a life of truth, and go on to 
lead a life of good, are withheld from evils and maintained in good by the Lord. The good they have from the Lord is the holiness with them. Consequently in the measure that they receive good from the 
Lord they are holy; and the measure of good they receive from the Lord, that is, the measure in which they are holy, is determined by how far they lead a life of good in keeping with the genuine truths 
of faith, and by how far at that time they believe that all the good they think and do then begins in the Lord. When they do these things the evils present with them are separated so that they do 
not at all appear, especially the evils they have derived by heredity from their parents, which are foul, because they have been accumulated from many ages back by successive generations of parents and 
accordingly heaped up in offspring. These are the interiors which with those belonging to the spiritual Church have been hidden away and so to speak covered over, <a href="966.htm">966</a>, <a href="1667.htm">1667</a>, <a href="2307.htm">2307</a>, <a href="2308.htm">2308</a>, <a href="3701.htm">3701</a>, <a href="4317.htm">4317</a>, <a href="8550.htm">8550</a>. So it is that the entire will they receive by heredity has been corrupted As a consequence of this they have a new will which the Lord forms in the understanding part of the mind by means of the 
truths of faith. This explains why they are led by means of truths to good while they are being regenerated, and after that, when they have been regenerated, from good into the truths of good. This shows 
plainly how their new will is created by the Lord. Regarding its formation in the understanding part of the mind with those belonging to the spiritual Church, see <a href="863.htm">863</a>, <a href="875.htm">875</a>, <a href="895.htm">895</a>, <a href="927.htm">927</a>, <a href="1023.htm">1023</a>, <a href="1043.htm">1043</a>,

`Et sanctificavit populum': quod significet obvelationem interiorum ut in fidei sancto appareant, constat ex illis quae supra n. 8788 explicata sunt, sed ibi expositum est quid sanctificatio apud populum 
Israeliticum, quod nempe fuerit obvelatio interiorum ut quoad externa apparerent in sancto, cum in cultu repraesentativo erant; et quod nisi {1}illorum interiora tunc obvelata fuerint, per foedas 
cogitationes et malas affectiones non modo contaminavissent sanctum cultus, sed etiam prorsus delevissent {2}, adeo ut nihil caeleste (c)et spirituale, quod repraesentatum est in externis, in caelo 
inde perceptum fuisset. 	2 Sed quia per `filios Israelis' hic intelliguntur illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, paucis dicetur quid per sanctificationem apud hos intelligitur: illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali 
sunt, qui vitam veri et inde vitam boni vivunt, detinentur a malis et tenentur in bono a Domino; bonum quod a Domino est sanctum apud illos, inde quantum boni recipiunt a Domino, tantum sunt {3}sancti; 
ac tantum {4}boni recipiunt a Domino, hoc est, tantum sunt sancti, quantum vivunt vitam boni secundum genuina vera fidei, et tunc quantum credunt quod omne bonum quod tunc cogitant et faciunt 
sit a Domino; tunc etiam mala {5} apud illos separantur, ut prorsus non appareant, imprimis quae hereditario traxerunt a parentibus, {6} quae foeda sunt, quia a pluribus aevis retro apud parentes successive 
cumulata sunt, et sic {7}in prolem congesta; haec interiora sunt quae apud illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali reconduntur et {8} quasi obvelantur, n. 966, 1667, 2307, 2308, 3701, 4317, 8550; {9}inde 
est quod omne voluntarium quod illis ex hereditario, {10}sit deperditum; {11}propterea apud illos novum voluntarium in parte intellectuali per vera fidei a Domino formatur; haec (t)causa est quod 
illi cum regenerantur per vera ducantur ad bonum, et postea cum regenerati sunt a bono in vera boni; inde patet quomodo novum voluntarium apud illos a Domino creatur; quod hoc formatum sit in (m)parte 
{12} intellectuali apud illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, videatur n. 863, 875, 895, 927, 1023, 1043, 1044, 1555, 2256, 4328, 4493, 5113, 6125.(n) 	@1 illa$ 	@2 i illum$ 	@3 sanctificati$ 	@4 bonum$ 	@5
