<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9946节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9946.</strong>“为亚伦的儿子”表在天堂，从主的神性良善发出的神性真理。这从“亚伦的儿子”的代表清楚可知，“亚伦的儿子”是指从主的神性良善发出的神性真理（参看<a href="9807.htm">9807</a>节）。之所以表示“在天堂”，是因为在天堂，主的神性之物就是亚伦和他儿子的祭司职分所代表的。在天堂，神性良善由亚伦的祭司职分来代表，从神性良善发出的神性真理由他儿子的祭司职分来代表。之所以说“在天堂”，是因为主自己作为天堂的太阳，远在天堂之上；然而，祂的同在在天堂里面，就仿佛祂自己在天堂里面。天堂里面的祂自己，也就是祂在那里的神性良善和神性真理能被代表；但祂那远在天堂之上的神性不能，后者无法落入人类心智，甚至天使心智的范畴，因为它是无限的；但从它发出进入天堂的神性之物适合那里接受。</p>

And for Aaron's sons. That this signifies the Divine truths that proceed from the Lord's Divine good in the heavens, is evident from the representation of the sons of Aaron, as being the Divine truths 
that proceed from the Lord's Divine good (see n. 9807). That "in the heavens" is signified, is because what is Divine of the Lord in the heavens is that which is represented by the priesthood of Aaron 
and his sons; Divine good in the heavens by the priesthood of Aaron, and Divine truth from Divine good there by the priesthood of his sons. It is said "in the heavens," because the Lord Himself is 
above the heavens, for He is the Sun of heaven; and yet His presence is in the heavens, and is as if He Himself were there. He Himself in the heavens, that is, His Divine good and His Divine truth there, 
can be represented; but not His Divine which is above the heavens, for the reason that the latter cannot fall into human minds, and not even into angelic minds, because it is infinite; but the Divine 
in the heavens which is from it, is accommodated to reception. </p>

'And for Aaron's sons' means Divine Truths emanating in the heavens from the Lord's Divine Good. This is clear from the representation of 'Aaron's sons' as Divine Truths emanating from the Lord's Divine 
Good, dealt with in <a href="9807.htm">9807</a>, in the heavens being meant because that which is Divine and the Lord's in the heavens is what the priestly office of Aaron and his sons represents. Divine Good in the heavens 
is represented by Aaron's priestly office, and Divine Truth from Divine Good there by that of his sons. The words 'in the heavens' are used because the Lord Himself, being the Sun of heaven, is above 
the heavens, yet has a presence within the heavens, which is such that it seems as though He Himself were there. The Lord as He is in the heavens - that is, His Divine Good and Divine Truth there 
- is able to be represented, but not that which is Divine and His above the heavens, because this cannot fall within the range of what human minds or even angelic minds can grasp, since it is infinite. 
But what is Divine and emanates from it into the heavens is suited to reception there.  </p>

`Et filiis Aharonis': quod significet Divina Vera ex Divino Bono Domini procedentia in caelis, constat ex repraesentatione `filiorum Aharonis' quod sint Divina Vera ex Divino Bono Domini procedentia, 
de qua n. 9807; quod in caelis, est quia Divinum Domini in caelis est quod repraesentatur per sacerdotium Aharonis et filiorum ejus; Divinum Bonum in caelis per sacerdotium Aharonis, et Divinum Verum 
ex Divino Bono ibi per sacerdotium filiorum ejus; dicitur in caelis, quia Ipse {1} Dominus est supra caelos, {2}est enim Sol caeli, {3}et usque praesentia Ipsius est in caelis, {4}quae talis est sicut 
Ipse (t)ibi esset; Ipse in caelis, hoc est, Divinum Bonum et Divinum Verum Ipsius ibi, potest repraesentari, sed non Divinum Ipsius supra caelos, ex causa quia hoc non cadere potest in mentes humanas, 
et ne quidem in angelicas, est enim infinitum; at Divinum in caelis quod inde, est accommodatum receptioni. @1 i enim$ @2 quia est$ @3 at$ @4 et ibi praesens$ </p>
