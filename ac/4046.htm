<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4046.</strong>许多灵人出现在头顶上方中间的地方，他们共同行动，就像心跳。不过，可以这是一种起伏波动，带有一种冷气吹在我额头上。我由此推断他们属于中间类的，也就是说，既属于心脏区域，也属于肺部区域，而且他们不是内层灵人。后来，这些灵人制造了一种火光，虽然低劣，但仍发出光来；这火光先是出现在左下巴之下，接着出现在左眼下，后来又出现在眼睛上面。不过，这火光昏暗，却在燃烧，只是不明亮。我从这些现象就能知道这些灵人的性质，因为光表明情感，以及聪明的程度。后来，我把手放在脑袋或头部的左侧，就感觉手掌下面有跳动，这种跳动有类似起伏波动的动作。我从这个迹象知道他们属于大脑。当我问他们是谁时，他们不愿回答。其他人谈到他们说，不说话是他们自己的选择。最后被逼之下，他们说，他们以这种方式透露他们是哪种灵人。我发现，他们当中有些灵人构成硬脑膜区域，也就是大小脑的总覆盖物。<br />然后，他们是哪类灵人就被透露出来，因为我蒙允许通过与他们交谈得知这一点。和从前活在世时一模一样，他们是那些不思想属灵或属天事物，也不谈论它们的灵人，因为他们是那种除了属世之物外，不信任何事物的存在之人。他们之所以不信任何事物，是因为他们无法越过属世之物去思考；然而，他们却不承认这种不信。相反，和其他一样，他们也敬拜神性，祷告，并且是好公民。<br />此后，有其他灵人流入心跳，但不是以起伏波动的方式，而是以交叉的方式；还有些灵人不是以交替的方式，而是以更为连续的方式行动；又有些灵人通过自己的行动使这种跳动从一个地方跳到另一个地方。他们说，他们与硬脑膜的外层有关，他们当中有些灵人只基于诸如为外在感官对象的那类事物来思想属灵和属天的事物，却不以任何其它方式来领悟内层事物。在我听来，他们的声音就像女性的声音。那些基于外在感官经验，因而基于世俗和尘世之物推理天上的事物，也就是推理信与爱的属灵之物的人，越是合为一体，并混在一起，就越来越向外，直到抵达他们所代表的头部表皮。然而，只要过着良善的生活，他们仍在大人里面，尽管是在大人的最末端或最外围部分。因为凡出于仁爱的情感过着良善生活的人都会得救。</p>

There appeared a number of spirits at a middle distance above the head, who acted in common by a kind of beating of the heart; but it was as it were a reciprocal undulation downward and upward, with 
a kind of cold breathing on my forehead. From this I was able to conclude that they were of a middle sort, belonging both to the province of the heart and to that of the lungs, and also that they were 
not interior spirits. The same spirits afterwards presented a flaming light, gross but yet luminous, which first appeared under the left side of the chin, afterwards under the left eye, and then above 
the eye, but it was dim and yet flaming, not shining white. From these things I was enabled to know their quality, for lights indicate affections, also degrees of intelligence. [2] When I afterwards 
applied my hand to the left side of the skull or head, I felt a pulsation under the palm, undulating in a similar manner downward and upward; from which indication I knew that they belonged to the brain. 
When I asked who they were, they were not willing to speak. It was said by others that they do not willingly speak. Being at last compelled to speak, they said that if they did so their quality 
would be disclosed. I perceived that they were of those who constitute the province of the dura mater, which is the general integument of the cerebrum and the cerebellum. It was then disclosed of what 
quality they were, for I was permitted to know this by speaking with them. They were (as before when they had lived as men) those who had thought nothing about spiritual and heavenly things, nor had 
they spoken about them; because they were such as to believe in nothing except that which is natural, and this because they had not been able to penetrate further, but yet had not confessed this unbelief. 
Nevertheless like others they had worshiped the Divine, had said their prayers, and had been good citizens. [3] There were afterwards others who also flowed into the heartbeat, but by an undulation 
not downward and upward, but crosswise; and others who flowed in not with a reciprocating action, but more continuously; and also others under whose action the beating jumped from one place to another. 
It was said that these had relation to the outer lamella of the dura mater, and that they were of those who had thought of spiritual and heavenly things solely from such things as are objects of 
the external senses, not conceiving of interior things in any other manner. These were heard by me as of the female sex. They who reason concerning the things of heaven, or the spiritual things of faith 
and love, from outward things of sense, and therefore from what is worldly and earthly, insofar as they make them a one and confound them together, wend their way more and more outward, even to the 
outer skin of the head, which they represent. Nevertheless provided they have led a good life, these are within the Grand Man, although in its extremes or outermost parts; for everyone is saved who 
is in the life of good from the affection of charity. </p>

A number of spirits once appeared overhead in a midway place, who were acting collectively like the beating of the heart. But it was so to speak a wave-like motion, alternatively falling and rising, 
with a kind of cold breath which struck my forehead. From this I was able to deduce that they were of the intermediate sort, that is to say, that they belonged both to the province of the heart and to 
that of the lungs, and also that they were not interior spirits. Afterwards the same spirits produced a flaming light, of poor quality but nevertheless luminous, which was first of all visible under 
the left side of the chin, then under the left eye, and after that above the eye. But it was a dim light; though flowing it was not bright. From all this I was enabled to know the nature of those spirits 
- lights being indicative of affections and also of levels of intelligence. When after this I laid my hand over the left side of my skull or head I felt a beating underneath my palm, which had a similar 
falling and rising wave-like motion. From this indication I knew that they belonged to the cerebrum. When I asked who they were they were unwilling to speak. Others said of them that it was their 
own choice not to speak. Compelled at length to do so they said that in that way they disclosed what kind of spirits they were. I perceived that among them there were those who constituted the province 
of the dura mater, which is the general covering of the cerebrum and of the cerebellum. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Then it was disclosed what sort of spirits they were, for this I was allowed to know by talking to them. 
Just the same as when they had lived as people in the world, they were spirits who gave no thought to spiritual or celestial matters and who did not talk about those things because they were the 
kind of people who did not believe in the existence of anything other than that which was natural. They had not believed in anything more because they could not think beyond that which was natural; yet 
they had not declared their unbelief. Rather, they had worshipped the Divine as others had done, had said their prayers, and had been good citizens. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 After this there were others who also entered 
into the beating of the heart, though not with a motion falling and rising but in a crosswise manner. There were others again who did not act in an alternating way but in a more continuous one. And 
there were others yet again by whose action the beating leapt from one place to another. They said that they had correlated with the outer layer of the dura mater, and that among them were some who 
thought about spiritual and celestial matters solely on the basis of such things as are the objects of the external senses. They did not comprehend interior things in any other way. To me they sounded 
like members of the female sex. People who reason on the basis of the experiences of the external senses, and so on the basis of worldly and earthly things, about the things of heaven, that is, about 
the spiritual things of faith and love - insofar as they make them all the same and confuse them together - move away to what is more and more outward until they reach, on the outside of the head, the 
skin which they represent. They are still inside the Grand Man even though in its outermost parts, if they have led a good life. For everyone is saved who leads a good life from a desire inspired by charity. </p>

Apparebant plures spiritus ad mediam distantiam supra caput qui agebant in communi per modum pulsus cordis, sed erat quasi reciproca undulatio deorsum et sursum, cum aspiratione quadam frigida in 
frontem meam; exinde concludere potui, quod mediae sortis essent, nempe quod tam ad cordis quam ad pulmonum provinciam pertinerent, et quoque quod non essent spiritus interiores; postea iidem sistebant 
lumen flammeum, crassum sed usque luminosum, quod primum apparuit sub sinistra parte menti, postea sub oculo sinistro, dein supra oculum, sed erat obscurum, at usque flammeum non candidum, ex 
quibus scire potui quales essent, nam lumina indicant affectiones, tum quoque gradus intelligentiae: postea cum adhiberem manum ad sinistram cranii seu capitis partem, sensi pulsum sub palma, undulantem 
similiter deorsum et sursum, ex quo indicio sciebam quod ad cerebrum pertinerent.  Cum quaesivi quinam essent, non loqui volebant; dicebatur ab diis quod non libenter loquuntur; tandem adacti 
ad loquendum, dicebant quod sic detegerentur quales essent; percepi quod inter illos essent qui constituunt provinciam durae matris, quae est integumentum commune cerebri seu cerebelli; [2] detectum 
dein quales illi essent, nam ex loquela cum illis hoc scire dabatur; erant sicut cum vixerunt homines, qui nihil cogitarunt de spiritualibus et caelestibus, nec de illis locuti, quia tales quod 
nihil aliud crediderint esse quam naturale, et hoc quia non penetrare potuerunt ultra, sed tamen id non confessi; usque tamen sicut alii coluerunt Divinum, precibus vacarunt, et boni cives fuerunt. 
 [3] Erant postea alii qui quoque in pulsum influebant, sed non per undulationem deorsum et sursum, verum transversim; alii iterum qui non reciproce, sed magis continue; et quoque alii a quibus pulsus 
actus subsiliebat ab uno loco in alterum; {1}dicebant quod illi referrent lamellam durae matris exteriorem; et quod inter tales essent qui cogitarunt de spiritualibus et caelestibus modo ex talibus 
quae sunt objecta sensuum externorum, quae interiora {2}erant, non aliter capientes; </p>
<p>mihi auditi sicut ex sexu feminino; qui ratiocinantur ex sensualibus externis, proinde ex mundanis et terrestribus, 
de illis quae sunt caeli seu de spiritualibus fidei et amoris, quo magis illa unum faciunt et confundunt, eo exterius vadunt, usque ad cutem capitis externam, quam repraesentant; at usque 
sunt intra Maximum Hominem tametsi in extremis ejus, si vitam boni egerunt; </p>
<p>{3}unusquisque enim qui in vita boni ex affectione charitatis est, salvatur. @1 dicebatur$ @2 essent$ @3 quam unusquisque$ </p>
