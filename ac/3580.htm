<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3580节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3580.</strong>“许多五谷”表由此衍生的属世良善，“新酒”表由此衍生的属世真理。这从“五谷”和“新酒”的含义清楚可知：“五谷”是指良善；“新酒”是指真理。当这二者用来论及属世层时，它们表示属世良善与真理；但当用来论及理性层时，它们就是“饼和酒”，“饼”是指属天良善（<a href="276.htm">276</a>，<a href="680.htm">680</a>，<a href="1798.htm">1798</a>，<a href="2165.htm">2165</a>，<a href="2177.htm">2177</a>，<a href="3464.htm">3464</a>，<a href="3478.htm">3478</a>节）；“酒”是指属灵之物，因而是指源于良善的真理（<a href="1071.htm">1071</a>，<a href="1798.htm">1798</a>节）。<br />“五谷”和“新酒”具有这些含义，也可从以下圣言经文看出来。哈该书：<br />天就不降甘露，地也不出土产。我叫干旱临到陆地、群山、五谷、新酒，并地上的出产。（哈该书<a href="http://39-27.cn/该1.10.htm">1:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/该1.11.htm">11</a>）<br />此处“干旱”表缺乏甘露和雨水，因而缺乏源于任何良善的真理。“临到五谷的干旱”是指缺乏良善，“临到新酒的干旱”是指缺乏真理。摩西五经：<br />以色列安然独居在雅各泉边，在五谷新酒之地，他的天也滴下甘露。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.28.htm">33:28</a>）<br />“独”表那些不受邪恶与虚假侵扰的人（<a href="139.htm">139</a>，<a href="471.htm">471</a>节）。“五谷新酒之地”表教会的良善与真理。何西阿书：<br />我必向以色列如甘露，他必如百合花开放，扎根如黎巴嫩；他的枝条必伸出，他的荣华如橄榄树，他的香气如黎巴嫩；曾住在他荫下的必归回，使五谷生长，开花如葡萄树；他的记忆如黎巴嫩的酒。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何14.5.htm">14:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何14.7.htm">7</a>）<br />此处“五谷”表属灵的良善，“酒”表属灵的真理。以赛亚书：<br />地被咒诅吞灭。新酒悲哀，葡萄树衰残；心中欢乐的俱都叹息。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.6.htm">24:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.7.htm">7</a>）<br />这论及属灵教会的刑罚。“新酒悲哀”表真理必走到尽头的事实。<br />耶利米书：<br />耶和华救赎了雅各。他们要来到锡安的高处歌唱，又流归耶和华的美善，就是五谷、新酒和油并羊羔、牛犊。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.11.htm">31:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.12.htm">12</a>） <br />“五谷、新酒”表良善和源于良善的真理；“油”表既产生它们又出自它们的良善；“羊羔、牛犊”表以这种方式所获得的真理；这就是这些事物的含义，故它们被称为“耶和华的美善”。何西阿书：<br />她不知道是我给她五谷、新酒和油，又加增她的金银，他们却以此为巴力制造。因此，到了所定的季节，我必回来将我的五谷、新酒收回，也必将我的羊毛、我的麻夺回来。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何2.8.htm">2:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何2.9.htm">9</a>）<br />这论及败坏的教会；显然，“五谷”不是指五谷，“新酒”也不是指新酒，“油”、“银”、“金”、“羊毛”、“麻”也不是指这类物质事物，而是指那些属灵之物，也就是良善与真理之物。在同一先知书中论述一个新教会的地方也一样：<br />我以诚实聘你归我，你就必认识耶和华。那日我必垂听诸天，它们必听地；地必听五谷、新酒和油，这些必听从耶斯列民。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何2.20.htm">2:20</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何2.22.htm">22</a>）<br />“耶斯列民”表一个新教会。约珥书：<br />酒醉的人哪，要清醒哭泣；好酒的人哪，都要为新酒哀号；因为酒从你们的口中断绝了。田荒凉，地悲哀，因为五谷毁坏，新酒干竭，油也缺乏。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥1.5.htm">1:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥1.10.htm">10</a>）<br /><br />你们锡安的子民要快乐，为耶和华你们的神欢喜，因祂为公义赐给你们早晨的雨水，为你们降下甘霖，就是在初春早晚降下雨水。禾场必满了纯净的五谷，榨槽必有新酒和油盈溢。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.23.htm">2:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.24.htm">24</a>）<br /><br />到那日，大山要滴甜酒，小山要流奶子，犹大溪河都有水流。必有泉源从耶和华的殿中流出来。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥3.18.htm">3:18</a>）<br />这论及主的国度；“甜酒”、“奶子”和“水”表示属灵之物，故经上以这种方式描述它们的丰盛。撒迦利亚书：<br />当那日，耶和华他们的神必看祂的百姓如羊群，拯救他们。祂的美善何等大！祂的荣美何其盛！五谷健壮少男；新酒培养处女。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚9.16.htm">9:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚9.17.htm">17</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />你眷顾地，使地大得肥美。神的溪流满了水；你好为他们预备五谷；草场以羊群为衣，谷中也长满了五谷。它们都欢呼歌唱！（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗65.9.htm">65:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗65.13.htm">13</a>）<br />由此可见“五谷”和“新酒”表示什么。</p>

And a multitude of corn. That this signifies the derivative natural good, and that "new wine" signifies the derivative natural truth, is evident from the signification of "corn," as being good; and from 
the signification of "new wine," as being truth; which when predicated of the natural signify natural good and truth, and then "bread and wine" are predicated of the rational. (That "bread" is celestial 
good, see above, n. 276, 680, 1798, 2165, 2177, 3464, 3478; and that "wine" is what is spiritual, thus truth from good, n. 1071, 1798.) [2] That "corn and new wine" have this signification, may 
be seen also from the following passages in the Word. In Haggai: </p>
<p>     The heavens are closed from dew, and the earth is closed from her produce. And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the 
mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine; and upon that which the ground bringeth forth (Hag. 1:10-11); </p>
<p>where "drought" denotes a lack of dew and of rain, thus a lack of truth derived from 
any good; "drought upon the corn" is a lack of good and "drought upon the new wine" is a lack of truth. In Moses: </p>
<p>     Israel shall dwell securely, alone at the fountain of Jacob in a land of corn 
and new wine; yea, his heavens shall drop down dew (Deut. 33:28); </p>
<p>"alone" denotes those who are not infested by evils and falsities (n. 139, 471); a "land of corn and new wine" denotes the good and 
truth of the church. [3] In Hosea: </p>
<p>     I will be as the dew unto Israel; he shall bud forth as the lily, and shall fix his roots as Lebanon; his branches shall go forth, and his honor shall be as 
the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon; they that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall vivify the corn, and blossom as the vine; his memory shall be as the wine of Lebanon (Hos. 14:5-7); </p>
<p>where 
"corn" denotes spiritual good and wine," spiritual truth. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The curse shall devour the earth. The new wine shall mourn, the vine shall languish, all the glad of heart shall sigh 
(Isa. 24:6-7); </p>
<p>where the vastation of the spiritual church is treated of; the "new wine mourning" denotes that truth shall cease. [4] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob. And they shall come 
and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together unto the goodness of Jehovah, to the corn and to the new wine, and to the oil, and to the sons of the flock and of the herd (Jer. 31:11-12); </p>
<p>the 
"corn and new wine" denote good and the derivative truth; "oil," the good from which they come, and which is from them; "the sons of the flock and of the herd," the truth which thus comes therefrom; 
and as these things have such a signification, they are called "the goodness of Jehovah." [5] In Hosea: </p>
<p>She did not know that I gave her the corn, and the new wine, and the oil, and multiplied 
unto her silver and gold which they made for Baal. Therefore will I return and take away My corn and My new wine in their appointed season, and I will pluck away My wool and My flax (Hos. 2:8-9); </p>
<p>where 
the church perverted is treated of; and it is manifest that by "corn" is not meant corn; nor by "new wine," new wine; neither by "oil," "silver," "gold," "wool," and "flax," are such things meant, 
but those which are spiritual; that is, those of good and truth. [6] In like manner where a new church is treated of, in the same Prophet: </p>
<p>     I will betroth thee unto Me in faithfulness and thou shalt 
know Jehovah. And it shall come to pass in that day that I will hearken to the heavens; and these shall hearken to the earth; and the earth shall hearken to the corn, and the new wine, and the oil; 
and these shall hearken to Jezreel (Hos. 2:20-22); </p>
<p>where "Jezreel" denotes a new church. In Joel: </p>
<p>Awake ye drunkards and weep, and howl all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine, for it is 
cut off from your mouth. The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted, the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth (Joel 1:5, 10). [7] Again: </p>
<p>     Rejoice ye sons of Zion, and be 
glad in Jehovah your God; for He hath given you the early rain for righteousness; and He will cause to come down for you the rain, the early rain and the latter rain in the first. And the floors shall 
be filled with pure corn, and the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil (Joel 2:23-24). Again in the same Prophet: </p>
<p>     And it shall come to pass in that day that the mountains shall drop down 
sweet wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the brooks of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall go forth out of the house of Jehovah (Joel 3:18); </p>
<p>where the Lord's kingdom is 
treated of; and by "sweet wine," by "milk," and by "waters," are signified spiritual things whose abundance is thus described. [8] In Zechariah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah their God shall save them in that day 
as the flock of His people. For how great is His goodness! and how great is His beauty! corn shall make the young men to flourish, and new wine the virgins (Zech. 9:16-17). In David: </p>
<p>     Thou dost 
visit the earth, and delightest in it; Thou greatly enrichest it; the stream of God is full of waters; Thou preparest them corn; the meadows are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over 
with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing (Ps. 65:9, 13). From all this we can see what is signified by "corn and new wine." </p>

'And abundance of grain' means natural good from this, 'and of new wine' means natural truth from the same. This is clear from the meaning of 'grain' as good, and from the meaning of 'new wine' as truth. 
When these two are used in reference to the natural they mean natural good and truth, but when they are used in reference to the rational they are 'bread and wine' - 'bread' being celestial good, 
see <a href="276.htm">276</a>, <a href="680.htm">680</a>, <a href="1798.htm">1798</a>, <a href="2165.htm">2165</a>, <a href="2177.htm">2177</a>, <a href="3464.htm">3464</a>, <a href="3478.htm">3478</a>, and 'wine' that which is spiritual, namely truth deriving from good, <a href="1071.htm">1071</a>, <a href="1798.htm">1798</a>. These meanings of 'grain' and 'wine' may also be seen from the following places 
in the Word: In Haggai, </p>
<blockquote>
The heavens have withheld their dew, and the earth has withheld its increase. And I have called for a drought over the land, and over the mountains, and over the grain, 
and over the new wine, and over that which the earth brings forth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hagg%201:10,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hagg 1:10, 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'a drought' stands for a lack of dew and rain, and so for a lack of truth deriving from any good. 'A drought 
over the grain' is the lack of good, and 'a drought over the new wine' the lack of truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Israel will dwell securely, alone at Jacob's spring, in a land of grain and new wine; and 
his heavens will distill dew. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2033:28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 33:28</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Alone' stands for those who are not infested by evils and falsities, <a href="139.htm">139</a>, <a href="471.htm">471</a>. 'A land of grain and new wine' stands for the good and truth of the Church. 
In Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
I will be as the dew to Israel, he will blossom<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> as the lily, and strike root like Lebanon. His branches will go out, and his beauty will be like the olive, and his odour like that of 
Lebanon. Those dwelling in its shadow will turn back, they will quicken the grain and will blossom as the vine; the memory of it will be as the wine of Lebanon. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%2014:5-7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 14:5-7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the grain' stands 
for spiritual good, 'the wine' for spiritual truth In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
A curse will consume the earth. The new wine will mourn, the vine will languish; all the merry-hearted will sigh. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2024:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 24:6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This 
refers to the vastation of the spiritual Church. 'The new wine will mourn' stands for the fact that truth will come to an end. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah has redeemed Jacob. They will come and 
sing on the height of Zion, and they will converge towards the goodness of Jehovah. towards the grain, and towards the new wine, and towards the oil, and towards the young<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> of the flock and of the herd. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2031:11,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 31:11, 12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The grain' and 'the new wine' stand for good and for truth derived from good, 'the oil' for the good which is both a producer and a product of these, 'the young of the flock and 
of the herd' for the truth which is acquired in this manner. This being the meaning of those things they are called 'the goodness of Jehovah'. In Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
She did not know that it was I who gave her 
the grain and the new wine and the oil, and who multiplied the silver and the gold which they made for Baal. Therefore I will return and take back My grain and My new wine in its season, and I will 
snatch away My wool and My flax. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%202:8,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 2:8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Church when perverted, and it is evident that 'grain' is not used to mean grain, nor 'new wine' new wine, nor yet oil, silver, gold, 
wool, and flax to mean such material things. Rather, spiritual things are meant, that is, those which consist in what is good and true. </p>
<p>Something similar is the case where in the same prophet a 
new Church is dealt with, </p>
<blockquote>
I will betroth you to Me in faith, and you will know Jehovah. And it will be on that day, that I shall hear the heavens, and they will hear the earth, and the earth will hear 
the grain, and the new wine, and the oil, and these will hear Jezreel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%202:20-22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 2:20-22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Jezreel' stands for a new Church. In Joel, </p>
<blockquote>
Awake, you drunkards, and weep; and wail, all you drinkers of 
wine, because of the new wine that has been cut off from your mouth. The field has been laid waste, the land is mourning because the grain has been laid waste; the new wine has dried up, the oil languishes. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%201:5,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 1:5, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Be glad, O children of Zion, and rejoice in Jehovah your God, for He has given you the morning rain for righteousness, and will cause the morning 
and the evening rain to come down on you in the first [month]. And the threshing-floors will be full of perfect grain, and the presses will overflow with new wine and oil. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%202:23,%2024&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 2:23, 24</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same 
prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
It will happen on that day, that the mountains will drip new wine, and the hills will flow with milk, and all the streams of Judah will flow with water, and a spring will come forth from 
the house of Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%203:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 3:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord's kingdom, it being spiritual things that are meant by 'new wine', 'milk', and 'water', the abundance of which is being described in this fashion. 
In Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah their God will serve them on that day, as a flock His people. For how great is his goodness, and how great his beauty! Grain will make the young men flourish, and new 
wine the virgins. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%209:16,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 9:16, 17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In David, </p>
<blockquote>
You visit the earth and delight in it; You greatly enrich it; the stream of God is full of water; You prepare their grain. The meadows clothe themselves 
with flocks, and the valleys are covered over with grain; let them clap their hands, let them also sing. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2065:9,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 65:9, 13</a> 
</blockquote>
<p>From all these places it is now evident what 'grain' is and what 'new wine' 
is.

non significetur frumentum, nec mustum per `mustum,' et quoque per `oleum, argentum, aurum, lanam et linum,' quod non talia, sed quae spiritualia sunt, {2}hoc est, boni et veri; similiter ubi agitur 
de nova Ecclesia apud eundem,      Desponsabo te Mihi in fide, et cognosces Jehovam, et erit in      die illo audiam caelos, et hi audient terram, et terra audiet      frumentum et mustum, et oleum, 
et haec audient Jizreelem, ii      20-22; </p>
<p>`Jizreel' pro nova Ecclesia: apud Joelem,      Expergiscimini ebrii et flete, et ejulate omnes potantes      vinum, propter mustum quod excisum est ex ore 
vestro;...      devastatus est ager, luget terra, quia devastatum est      frumentum, exaruit mustum, languet oleum, i 5, 10: 4  apud eundem,      Filii Zionis gaudete, et laetamini in Jehovah 
Deo vestro, quia      dedit vobis pluviam matutinam in justitiam, et descendere      faciet vobis pluviam matutinam et serotinam in primo, et      implebuntur areae frumento puro, et exundabunt torcularia  
    mustum et oleum, ii 23, 24 apud eundem,      Fiet in die illo, stillabunt montes mustum, et colles fluent      lacte, et omnes rivi Jehudae fluent aquis, et fons e domo      Jehovae 
exibit, iv [A.V. iii] 18; </p>
<p>ibi de regno Domini; sunt spiritualia quae per `mustum,' per `lac,' et per `aquas' significantur, quorum abundantia ita describitur: apud Zachariam,      Servabit illos Jehovah 
Deus illorum in die illo, sicut gregem      populum Suum,... quia quanta bonitas ejus, et quanta      pulchritudo ejus, frumentum juvenes, et mustum germinare      faciet virgines, ix 16, 17: </p>
<p>apud 
Davidem,      Visitas terram, et {3}delectaris ea, valde ditas eam, rivus      Dei plenus aquis, praeparas frumentum eorum,...   induunt      prata gregem, et valles operiuntur frumento; plaudant 
etiam      cantent, Ps. lxv 10, 14 [A.V. 9, 13]; </p>
<p>inde nunc patet quid frumentum et mustum. @1 ubi$ @2 seu$ @3 so Sch. Heb. also means `causest to overflow'$ </p>
