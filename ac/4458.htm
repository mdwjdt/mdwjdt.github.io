<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4458节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4458.</strong>创世记34:13-17.雅各的儿子们，因为示剑玷污了他们的妹子底拿，就以诡诈回答示剑和他父亲哈抹，也如此说话。对他们说，我们不能照这话去做，把我们的妹子给有阳皮的人，因为那是我们的羞辱。惟有一个条件才可以应允，若你们所有的男丁都受割礼，和我们一样，我们就把女儿给你们，也娶你们的女儿，我们便与你们同住，成为一样的人民。倘若你们不听从我们受割礼，我们就带着我们的女儿走了。<br />“雅各的儿子们就以诡诈回答示剑和他父亲哈抹”表对古人当中的教会真理与良善所怀的邪恶思想和意图。“也如此说话，因为示剑玷污了他们的妹子底拿”表结合的第一个阶段没什么不同，也要通过接受实现。“对他们说，我们不能照这话去做”表他们不赞成。“把我们的妹子给有阳皮的人”表除非他们能把教会的真理并良善与代表等同起来，无视这些所表示的属灵实体。“因为那是我们的羞辱”表这会违背他们。“惟有一个条件才可以应允，若（你们）和我们一样”表接受他们的宗教表象。“你们所有的男丁都受割礼”表纯粹的外在代表，因而对他们来说，那时他们就洁净了。“我们就把女儿给你们，也娶你们的女儿”表以这种方式联结起来。“我们便与你们同住”表在生活上。“成为一样的人民”表在教义上。“倘若你们不听从我们受割礼”表除非他们离弃自己的真理，接受外在代表。“我们就带着我们的女儿走了”表不会有结合。</p>

Verses 13-17. And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father in fraud, and spoke, because he had defiled Dinah their sister; and they said unto them, We cannot do this word, to give our 
sister to a man that hath a foreskin, because this would be a reproach unto us. Nevertheless in this we will consent to you, if ye be as we, to circumcise for you every male. We will both give our daughters 
to you, and will take your daughters to us; and we will dwell with you, and we will be for one people. And if ye will not listen unto us to circumcise, we will even take our daughter and go. "And 
the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father in fraud," signifies an evil opinion and intention concerning the truth and good of the Church among the Ancients; "and spoke, because he had 
defiled Dinah their sister," signifies that the initiation to conjunction, which could not be different, should be made by accession; "and they said unto them, We cannot do this word," signifies that 
they disapproved; "to give our sister to a man that hath a foreskin," signifies unless they made the truth and good of the church to consist in representatives, and would recede from the things which 
these signify; "because this would be a reproach unto us," signifies that this would be contrary to them; "nevertheless in this will we consent to you, if ye be as we," signifies accession to their 
religiosity; "to circumcise for you every male," signifies an external representative only, and that so they would be pure to them; "we will both give our daughters to you, and will take your daughters 
to us," signifies conjunction in this manner; "and we will dwell with you," signifies in respect to life; "and we will be for one people," signifies in respect to doctrine; "and if ye will not listen 
unto us to circumcise," signifies unless they would recede from their truths and accede to external representatives; "We will even take our daughter and go," signifies that there would be no conjunction. </p>

Verses 13-17 And Jacob's sons answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and [so] spoke, because he had defiled Dinah their sister. And they said to them, We cannot do this thing, to give our 
sister to a man who has a foreskin; for that would be a reproach to us. Only on this [condition] will we consent to you: If you will be as we are, by circumcising every male among you, then we will give 
our daughters to you, and your daughters we will take to ourselves, and we will dwell with you, and we will be one people. And if you do not listen to us to be circumcised, then we will take our daughter 
and go. </p>
<p>Jacob's sons answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully' means evil thought and intention regarding the truth and the good of the Church among the Ancients. 'And [so] spoke, 
because he had defiled Dinah their sister' means that the first stage in the joining together which could not be anything different was effected through acceptance. 'And they said to them, We cannot do 
this thing' means their disapproval. 'To give our sister to a man who has a foreskin' means unless they could identify the truth and the good of the Church with representatives and disregard the spiritual 
entities meant by these. 'For that would be a reproach to us' means that it would be contrary to them. 'Only on this [condition] will we consent to you: If you will be as we are' means acceptance 
of their semblance of religion. 'By circumcising every male among you' means a merely external representative, and then to them they would be pure. 'Then we will give our daughters to you, and your 
daughters we will take to ourselves' means a joining together in this manner. 'And we will dwell with you' means in life. 'And we will be one people' means in doctrine. 'And if you do not listen to us 
to be circumcised' means unless they forsook their own truths and accepted external representatives. 'Then we will take our daughter and go' means that there would be no joining together. </p>

Vers. 13-17.  Et responderunt filii Jacobi Shechemo et Hamori patri illius in fraude, et locuti sunt, quia polluit Dinam sororem illorum.  Et dixerunt ad illos, Non possumus facere verbum hoc, dare 
sororem nostram viro cui praeputium, quia opprobrium hoc nobis.  Verumtamen in hoc consentiemus vobis, si sitis sicut nos, ad circumcidendum vobis omnem masculum.  Et dabimus filias nostras vobis, 
et filias vestras accipiemus nobis, et habitabimus cum vobis, et erimus in populum unum.  Et si non audiatis ad nos ad circumcidendum, et sumemus filiam nostram, et ibimus. `Responderunt filii Jacobi 
Shechemo et Hamori patri illius in fraude' significat malam opinionem et intentionem de vero et bono Ecclesiae apud antiquos: `et locuti sunt, quia polluit Dinam sororem illorum' significat quod 
initiatio ad conjunctionem quae non alia esse potuit, fieret per accessionem: `et dixerunt ad illos, Non possumus facere verbum hoc' significat quod improbarent: `dare sororem nostram viro cui 
praeputium' significat nisi in repraesentativis ponerent verum et bonum Ecclesiae et recederent ab illis quae significant: `quia opprobrium hoc nobis' significat quod contra eos esset: `verumtamen 
in hoc consentiemus vobis, si sitis sicut nos significat accessionem ad illorum religiosum: `ad circumcidendum vobis omnem masculum' significat repraesentativum externum solum, et sic illis puri essent: 
`et dabimus filias nostras vobis, et filias vestras accipiemus nobis' significat sic conjunctionem: `et habitabimus cum vobis' significat quoad vitam: `et erimus in populum unum' significat quoad 
doctrinam: `et si non audiatis ad nos ad circumcidendum' significat nisi recesserint a suis veris et accesserint ad repraesentativa externa: `et sumemus filiam nostram et ibimus' significat quod 
nulla conjunctio. </p>
