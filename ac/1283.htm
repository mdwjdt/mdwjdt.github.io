<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1283节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">内义</h4><br />1283.现在的主题是总体上的古教会。事实上，随着时间推移，它的内在敬拜被歪曲和篡改；因此，它的外在敬拜也是如此，因为外在敬拜的品质取决于内在敬拜的品质。内在敬拜的歪曲和篡改在此用“巴别”来表示。到目前为止，所提到的历史事件，除了关于希伯的那部分外，都不是真实的，而是虚构出来的。这一事实可从本章给出的有关巴别塔的细节看出来：人们打算建造通天塔；他们的口音变乱，以致没人听懂彼此；以这种方式变乱他们的，正是耶和华。这一事实也可从经上说这是巴别的起源，而前一章10节却说巴别是宁录建造的看出来。由此还清楚可知，巴别并非指一座城，而是指某种真实事物，在此它表示内在不洁的敬拜，而它的外在敬拜看似圣洁。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1283.</strong> Inner Meaning<br />THE present topic is the ancient church in general and the fact that its inward worship was falsified and adulterated as time passed. Its outward worship accordingly suffered the same fate, because outward worship mirrors inward. The falsification and adulteration of inward worship is portrayed as Babel here.<br />Up to this point the narrative (aside from what it says about Eber) is fiction rather than history, as the story about the Babylonian tower{*1} shows. Consider the idea that people set about to build a tower with its head in the sky, for instance; that their language was muddled so that they would be unable to understand one another's language; and that Jehovah is the one who caused the confusion. Another piece of evidence is the claim that Babel grew out of this incident, when verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1283/bible_king-james-version_genesis_11_10" target=_top>10</a> of the last chapter says that Nimrod built it. This too shows that Babel does not mean a city but some phenomenon; here it means worship that is profane within despite an outward appearance of sanctity.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The "Babylonian tower" is the Tower of Babel. See note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1283/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1182" target=_top>1182</a>. [LHC] </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE The Ancient Church in general is now treated of, and it is shown that in course of time its internal worship was falsified and adulterated; and consequently its external worship also, 
for the quality of the external worship is determined by that of the internal worship. The falsification and adulteration of internal worship here is "Babel." That thus far-except what is said about 
Eber-the historical incidents were not true, but were made up, may be further seen from what is here said about the Babylonish tower-that men undertook to build a tower whose top should be in heaven, 
that their lips were confounded so that one should not hear the lip of another, and that Jehovah thus confounded them; and also from its being said that this was the origin of Babel, whereas in the 
preceding chapter (verse 10) it is said that Babel was built by Nimrod. It is also evident from all this that Babel does not signify a city, but a certain actual thing; and here a worship whose interiors 
are profane, while its externals appear holy. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE </p>
<p>The subject now is the Ancient Church in general and the fact that its internal worship in process of time was falsified and adulterated; and so as a consequence was its external 
worship, for the character of external worship depends on that of internal. The falsification and adulteration of internal worship is meant here by Babel. The fact that the historical events mentioned 
up to now, apart from those concerning Eber, are not true but made-up may also be seen from the details given in this chapter concerning the tower of Babel - men set out to build a tower whose head 
was in heaven; their lips were confused so that no one could hear another; it was Jehovah who confused them in this way. This fact may also be seen from the assertion that this was the origin of Babel 
and yet verse 10 of the previous chapter says that Babel was built by Nimrod. From this it is also clear that Babel does not mean a city, but some real thing, and that here it means worship whose interior 
features are not holy though its external appear so. </p>

SENSUS INTERNUS </p>
<p>AGITUR nunc de Ecclesia Antiqua in genere, et quod cultus ejus internus successu temporis falsificatus et adulteratus sit, inde quoque cultus externus, nam se habet cultus 
externus secundum internam; falsificatio et adulteratio cultus interni est hic 'Babel.' Quod huc usque, praeter quae de Ebero, historica non vera fuerint sed facta, videri potest etiam ex his de 
turri Babylonica, ut quod aggressi aedificare turrim cujus caput in caelo, quod labia confusa sint ut non audiret unus labium alterius, quod Jehovah sic confuderit; tum etiam ex eo quod inde Babel, cum 
tamen in praecedente capite vers. 10, Babel dicitur aedificata a Nimrodo; inde quoque constat quod Babel non significet urbem, sed quandam rem, et hic cultum cujus interiora sunt profana, at externa 
apparent sancta. </p>
