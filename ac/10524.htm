THE INTERNAL SENSE. Verses 1-3. And Jehovah spoke unto Moses, Go, go up from hence, thou and the people which thou hast made to come up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land of which I sware unto 
Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, To thy seed will I give it; and I will send an angel before thee, and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, 
and the Jebusite; unto a land flowing with milk and honey; for I will not go up in the midst of thee; because thou art a stiff-necked people. Perchance I should consume thee in the way. "And Jehovah 
spoke unto Moses," signifies instruction concerning the quality of the worship and of the church with the Israelitish nation; "Go, go up from hence, thou and the people which thou hast made to come 
up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land," signifies that this nation is to represent the church, but that no church shall be in it, because it cannot be raised from external things; "of which I sware 
unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, To thy seed will I give it," signifies that it is promised to those who from the Lord are in the good of love and in the truths of faith; "and I will 
send an angel before thee," signifies the Divine of the Lord from which is the church and its worship; "and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, 
and the Jebusite," signifies the casting out thence of all evils and falsities; "unto a land flowing with milk and honey," signifies what is pleasant and delightful from the good of faith and of love; 
"for I will not go up in the midst of thee," signifies that nevertheless the Divine was not with the nation itself; "because thou art a stiff necked people" signifies that they do not receive any influx 
from the Divine; "perchance I should consume thee in the way," signifies that if what is Divine were to flow in with this nation it would perish. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE  </p>
<p>Verses 1-3  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, Go! go up from here, you and the people whom you have caused to come up out of the land of Egypt, to the land which I swore to Abraham, 
Isaac, and Jacob, saying, To your seed I will give it. And I will send an angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 
[Go up] to a land flowing with milk and honey; for I will not go up in your midst, since you are a stiff-necked people [and] perchance I might consume you on the way. </p>
<p>'And Jehovah spoke to 
Moses' means instruction regarding the essential nature of the worship and the Church among the Israelite nation. 'Go! go up from here, you and the people whom you have caused to come up out of the land 
of Egypt, to the land' means that this nation will represent the Church, but the Church will not reside among them, because they cannot be raised from external things. 'Which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, 
and Jacob, To your seed I will give it' means the Church promised to those who have within themselves from the Lord the good of love and the truths of faith. 'And I will send an angel before you' 
means that which is Divine and the Lord's, from which the Church and its worship spring. 'And I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite' 
means the expulsion from there of all evils and falsities. '[Go up] to a land flowing with milk and honey' means feelings of pleasure and delight derived from the good of faith and love. 'For I 
will not go up in your midst' means that nevertheless what is Divine does not reside with the actual nation. 'Since you are a stiff-necked people' means that they do not receive any influx from the Divine. 
'Perchance I might consume you on the way' means that this nation would be destroyed if what is Divine were to flow in and reside with it.  </p>

SENSUS INTERNUS </p>
<p>Vers. 1-3.  Et locutus est Jehovah ad Moschen, Vade, ascende abhinc, tu et populus quem ascendere fecisti e terra Aegypti, ad terram quam juravi Abrahamo, 
Jischako, et Jacobo, dicendo, Semini tuo dabo illam.  Et mittam ante te angelum, et expellam Canaanitam, Emorritam, et Chittitam, et Perisitam, Chivitam, et Jebusitam.  Ad terram fluentem lacte et 
melle, quia non ascendam in medio tui, quia populus durus cervice tu, forte consumpsero te in via.  `Et locutus est Jehovah ad Moschen' significat instructionem de quali cultus et Ecclesiae apud gentem 
Israeliticam:  `vade, ascende abhinc, tu et populus quem ascendere fecisti e terra Aegypti, ad terram' significat quod gens illa repraesentatura sit Ecclesiam, sed non erit apud illam Ecclesia, quia 
elevari ab externi nequit:  `quam juravi Abrahamo, Jischako, et Jacobo, Semini tuo dabo illam' {1}significat promissam illis qui a Domino sunt in bono amoris et veris fidei:  `et mittam ante te angelum' 
significat Divinum Domini, ex quo {2}Ecclesia et ejus cultus:  `et expellam Canaanitam, Emorritam, et Chittitam, et Perisitam, Chivitam, et Jebusitam' significat ejectionem inde omnium malorum et 
falsorum:  `ad terram fluentem lacte et melle significat amoenum et jucundum ex bono fidei et amoris:  `quia non ascendam in medio tui' significat non tamen usque Divinum apud ipsam gentem:  `quia populus 
durus cervice tu significat quod non recipiat aliquem influxum a Divino:  `forte consumpsero te in via' significat quod gens illa, si Divinum influeret apud illam, periret. @1 quod significet IT$ @2
