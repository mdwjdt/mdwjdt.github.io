Verses 17-20. And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me I pray sip a little water from thy pitcher. And she said, Drink, my lord; and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and made 
him drink. And she finished making him drink, and she said, I will draw for thy camels also, until they have done drinking. And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto 
the well to draw, and drew for all his camels. "The servant ran to meet her, and said," signifies exploration from Divine good; "let me I pray sip a little water from thy pitcher," signifies inquiry 
whether anything of truth from this source can be conjoined; "and she said, Drink, my lord," signifies reciprocation; "and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand," signifies submission 
of the recipients from power; "and made him drink," signifies initiation. "And she finished making him drink," signifies what is successive; "and she said, I will draw for thy camels also, until they 
have done drinking," signifies reciprocation as to the enlightenment of all the memory-knowledges in the natural man. "And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough," signifies the separation 
of the affection of truth which was being initiated into Divine good; "and ran again unto the well," signifies a lower affection of truth; "and drew for all his camels," signifies whereby the general 
memory-knowledges were enlightened. </p>

Verses 17-20 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me sip now a little water from your pitcher. And she said, Drink, my lord. And she hastened and lowered her pitcher on to her hand and gave 
him a drink. And she finished giving him the drink and said, I will draw for your camels also until they have finished drinking. And she hastened and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again 
to the well to draw, and drew for all his camels. </p>
<p>'The servant ran to meet her, and said' means investigation by Divine Good. 'Let me sip now a little water from your pitcher' means to see whether 
it was possible for any truth from that source to be joined to it. 'And she said, Drink, my lord' means an affirmative response. 'And she hastened and lowered her pitcher on to her hand' means the submission 
of the recipients which was accomplished by power. 'And gave him a drink' means introduction. 'And she finished giving him the drink' means the subsequent stage. 'And said, I will draw for your 
camels also until they have finished drinking' means the affirmative response as regards the enlightenment of all facts within the natural man. 'And she hastened and emptied her pitcher into the trough' 
means the separation of the affection for truth which was being introduced into Divine good. 'And ran again to the well' means a lower affection for truth. 'And drew for all his camels' means by 
which general facts were enlightened. </p>

Vers. 17-20.  Et cucurrit servus obviam illi, et dixit, Sorbere fac me quaeso parum aquae e cado tuo.  Et dixit, Bibe domine mi, et festinavit et demisit cadum suum super manum suam, et potare fecit 
illum.  Et absolvit potare facere illum, et dixit, Etiam camelis tuis hauriam, usque dum absolverint bibere. Et festinabat et evacuabat cadum suum ad canalem, et currebat adhuc ad puteum ad hauriendum, 
et hauriebat omnibus camelis illius.  `Cucurrit servus obviam illi, et dixit' significat explorationem a Divino Bono: `Sorbere fac me quaeso parum aquae e cado tuo' significat num inde aliquid veri 
conjungi posset: `et dixit, Bibe domine mi' significat reciprocum: `et festinavit et demisti cadum super manum suam' significat submissionem recipientium ex potentia: `et potare fecit illum' significat 
initiationem: `et absolvit potare facere illum' significat successivum: `et dixit, Etiam camelis tuis hauriam usque dum absolverint bibere' significat reciprocum quoad illustrationem omnium scientificorum 
in naturali homine: `et festinabat et evacuabat cadum suum ad canalem' significat separationem affectionis veri quae initiabatur bono Divino: `et currebat adhuc ad puteum' significat affectionem 
veri inferiorem: `et hauriebat omnibus camelis illius' significat qua illustrabantur scientifica communia. </p>
