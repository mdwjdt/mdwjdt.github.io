<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8724节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8724.</strong>“于是，摩西听从他岳父的声音，按着他所说的一切去行”表神性良善所定的安排被付诸实施。这是显而易见的，无需解释；因为摩西的岳父叶忒罗代表神性良善（参看<a href="8643.htm">8643</a>节），而摩西代表从神性良善发出的神性真理（<a href="8644.htm">8644</a>节）。从主发出的神性真理凭自己什么也做不了；它的行为总是源于神性良善，也就是神性本身。神性良善是存在，而神性真理则是由这存在所产生的彰显或显现。所以存在必存在于彰显或显现里面，好叫这彰显或显现能成为某种东西，并且某种东西能由于它们的合一而实现。当主在世时，祂是神性真理；那时存在于祂里面的神性良善是“父”；但当祂得了荣耀时，祂的人身也就变成了神性良善。这时从祂发出的神性真理被称为保惠师，或真理的灵。一个人若知道这两个奥秘，那么在阅读圣言时就会被主启示，对主自己指着父和祂自己，以及保惠师，就是真理的灵所说的许多话有一些理解；否则，这些话将是无法理解的秘密；如在约翰福音：<br />耶稣说，子凭着自己不能做什么，惟有看见父所做的，子才能做；父所做的事，子也照样做。因为父怎样在自己有生命，就赐给子也照样在自己有生命。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.19.htm">5:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.26.htm">26</a>）<br /><br />那时圣灵还没有降临，因为耶稣还没有得着荣耀。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约7.39.htm">7:39</a>）<br /><br />我若不去，保惠师就不到你们这里来；我若去，就差祂到你们这里来。祂，就是真理的灵，不是凭自己说的，乃是把祂所听见的都说出来。祂要荣耀我，因为祂必从我领受。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.7.htm">16:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.14.htm">14</a>）<br />其它地方还有更多类似经文。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8724</b></p><p><b>8724.</b>
And Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said. That this signifies the effect according to the setting in order of Divine good, is evident without explication; for 
by Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, is represented the Divine good (see n. 8643), and by Moses the Divine truth which proceeds from the Divine good (n. 8644). The Divine truth which proceeds from the 
Lord does nothing of itself, but from the Divine good which is the Divine Itself; for the Divine good is the Being, but the Divine truth is the Coming-forth therefrom; wherefore the Being must be in the 
Coming-forth that this may be anything, and consequently that anything may be done. When the Lord was in the world He was Divine truth, and then the Divine good in Him was "the Father;" but when He 
was glorified, then He became the Divine good even as to the Human. The Divine truth which then proceeded from Him is called the "Paraclete," or "Spirit of Truth." He who knows these two arcana, if he 
is in enlightenment from the Lord when he reads the Word, can be in the understanding of many things which the Lord Himself spoke concerning the Father and concerning Himself, and also concerning the 
Paraclete, the Spirit of Truth, which otherwise would be incomprehensible mysteries; as in John: </p>
<p>     Jesus said, The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father doing; for what things 
soever He doeth, these the Son also doeth in like manner. As the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given also to the Son to have life in Himself (John 5:19, 26).      The Holy Spirit was not 
yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified (John 7:39).      If I go not away, the Paraclete will not come unto you; but If I go, I will send Him unto you; He, the Spirit of Truth, shall not speak from 
Himself; but what things soever He shall hear, shall He speak. He shall glorify Me, for He shall receive of Mine (John 16:7, 13, 14); </p>
<p>and more similar passages elsewhere. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8724</b></p><p><b>8724.</b>
'And Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he said' means that the arrangement by Divine Good was put into effect. This is clear without explanation, for Jethro, the father-in-law 
of Moses, represents Divine Good, <a href="8643.htm">8643</a>, while Moses represents Divine Truth emanating from Divine Good, <a href="8644.htm">8644</a>. Divine Truth emanating from the Lord never acts independently; its actions spring 
always from Divine Good, which is the Divine Himself. Divine Good is Being, whereas Divine Truth is the Coming-into-Being that arises from that Being. Consequently the Being must be present within the 
Coming-into-Being, if this is to be anything and anything is to be effected as a result of their union. When the Lord was in the world He was Divine Truth. The Divine Good present in Him then was the 
Father; but now that He has been glorified His Human too has become Divine Good. And the Divine Truth that emanates from Him now is called the Paraclete or Spirit of Truth. If a person acquainted with 
these two arcana is enlightened by the Lord when he reads the Word, he can have some understanding of a great number of the things spoken by the Lord regarding the Father and Himself, and regarding 
the Paraclete, the Spirit of Truth - things which would otherwise be incomprehensible mysteries, such as the following statements in John, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said, The Son cannot do anything of Himself, unless 
He sees the Father doing it; for what He does, this also the Son in like manner does. As the Father has life in Himself, so He has also granted the Son to have life in Himself. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%205:19,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 5:19, 26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Again 
in the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
The Holy Spirit was not yet because Jesus was not yet glorified. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%207:39&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 7:39</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere, </p>
<blockquote>
If I do not go away the Paraclete will not come to you; but if I go away I will 
send Him to you. He the Spirit of Truth will not speak from Himself, but whatever He hears He will speak; He will glorify Me, because He will take of what is Mine. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2016:7,%2013,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 16:7, 13, 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And there are 
many other statements like these. </p>

`Et auscultavit Moscheh voci soceri sui, et fecit omne quod dixit': quod significet effectum secundum ordinationem Divini [Boni], constat absque explicatione, nam per `Jethronem' socerum Moschis repraesentatur 
Divinum Bonum, n. 8643, et per `Moschen' Divinum Verum quod ex Divino Bono {1} procedit, n. 8644; Divinum Verum quod procedit a Domino ex se nihil agit sed ex Divino Bono, {2}quod est ipsum 
Divinum, nam Divinum Bonum est Esse, Divinum Verum autem est Existere inde, quare erit Esse in Existere ut hoc aliquid sit, et inde aliquid fiat; Dominus cum {3}fuit in mundo, Divinum Verum fuit, et 
tunc Divinum Bonum in Ipso fuit Pater; at cum glorificatus est, tunc Ipse factus est Divinum Bonum etiam quoad Humanum; Divinum Verum quod ab Ipso tunc procedit vocatur Paracletus seu Spiritus Veritatis; 
qui haec duo arcana novit, is, si in illustratione est a Domino, cum legit Verbum, potest esse in intellectu plurium quae Ipse Dominus locutus est de Patre et de Se, {4} et de Paracleto Spiritu Veritatis, 
quae alioquin mysteria {5}incomprehensibilia forent, prout quae apud Johannem, Jesus dixit, Non potest Filius facere a {6}Seipso quicquam, nisi viderit Patrem facientem; nam quae Ille facit, 
haec etiam Filius similiter facit: quemadmodum Pater habet vitam in {6}Seipso, ita dedit etiam Filio vitam habere in {6}Seipso, v 19, 26: </p>
<p>tum apud eundem, Nondum erat Spiritus Sanctus, quia Jesus 
nondum glorificatus est, vii 39: </p>
<p>et alibi, Si non abirem, Paracletus non veniet ad vos; si vero abivero, mittam illum ad vos; Spiritus Ille Veritatis non loquetur a {1}Seipso sed quaecumque audiverit, 
loquetur: Ille Me glorificabit, quia ex Meo, accipiet, xvi 7, 13 [, 14]; </p>
<p>et plura similia alibi. 	@1 i, quod est Dominus,$ 	@2 hoc est, Domino$ 	@3 After mundo$ 	@4 i ut IT$ 	@5 non comprehensibilia$ 	@6
