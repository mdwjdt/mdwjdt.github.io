<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8521节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8521.</strong>“样子像芫荽的种子，白色”表它里面的真理，它是纯净的。这从“种子”的含义清楚可知，“种子”是指信之真理（参看<a href="255.htm">255</a>，<a href="1940.htm">1940</a>，<a href="2048.htm">2048</a>，<a href="3038.htm">3038</a>，<a href="3310.htm">3310</a>，<a href="3373.htm">3373</a>节）。经上之所以说“像芫荽的种子”，是因为它是白色的；而“白色”论及真理，真理也表现为白色（<a href="3301.htm">3301</a>，<a href="3993.htm">3993</a>，<a href="4007.htm">4007</a>，<a href="5319.htm">5319</a>节）。现在描述的是“吗哪”所表示的真理之良善，既描述这个实体中的真理的本质，也描述它里面的良善的本质。它的“样子像芫荽的种子，白色”描述了真理的本质，“味道如同蜜饼”描述了良善的本质。<br />真理之良善，也就是存在于那些属于主的属灵国度之人身上的良善，完全不同于存在于那些属于主的属天国度之人身上的良善。存在于那些属于属灵国度之人身上的真理之良善被植入心智的理解力部分；因为主在理解力部分形成一个新的意愿，当一个人有意愿照他从其教会的教导那里所吸收的真理行事时，这新的意愿就存在于他里面。当他意愿并行出这真理时，该真理就变成与他同在的良善，被称为“属灵的良善”，也被称为“真理之良善”。他确实以为这是真正的真理，因为他信所教导他的东西。但他对它是不是真理没有任何觉知，除非他觉得自己似乎因以下事实而拥有它：他已经部分通过圣言的字义，部分通过支持他已接受的观点的错误认识而为自己证明了它；却没有想到，没有什么东西，甚至包括虚假本身，是不能被证明，以至于看似真理的（<a href="4741.htm">4741</a>，<a href="5033.htm">5033</a>，<a href="6865.htm">6865</a>，<a href="7012.htm">7012</a>，<a href="7680.htm">7680</a>，<a href="7950.htm">7950</a>节）。正因如此，所有人，包括苏西尼派和犹太人自己，无一例外地相信他们的教义是真理。<br />这一切表明对许多教会成员来说，被转化为良善的真理，其本质是什么。除了那些为了生活中的功用或有用的服务而对真理拥有一种情感的人之外，他们当中没有人能看出他们教会的教导是否真实。那些持有这个目的的人不仅在他们活在世上的时候，而且以后都会不断被主启示。唯独他们是能领受真理的人，因为主通过良善引导他们，并通过该良善使他们能看见真理，进而相信。由此明显可知诸如存在于那些属于主的属灵国度之人身上的良善，其起源和性质是什么。不过，诸如存在于那些属于主的属天国度之人身上的良善并没有被植入心智的理解力部分，而是被植入意愿部分。那些处于这个良善的人通过从主所领受的内在觉知知道某事是否真实。关于这两种良善，以及它们之间的区别，可参看前文（<a href="2046.htm">2046</a>，<a href="2088.htm">2088</a>，<a href="2227.htm">2227</a>，<a href="2669.htm">2669</a>，<a href="2715.htm">2715</a>，<a href="2718.htm">2718</a>，<a href="3235.htm">3235</a>，<a href="3240.htm">3240</a>，<a href="3241.htm">3241</a>，<a href="3246.htm">3246</a>，<a href="4138.htm">4138</a>，<a href="4493.htm">4493</a>，<a href="5113.htm">5113</a>，<a href="6500.htm">6500</a>，<a href="6865.htm">6865</a>，<a href="7233.htm">7233</a>，<a href="7977.htm">7977</a>，<a href="7992.htm">7992</a>节）。</p>

And it was like coriander seed, white. That this signifies the truth therein, that it was pure, is evident from the signification of "seed," as being the truth of faith (see n. 255, 1940, 2048, 3038, 
3310, 3373). It is said "like coriander seed," because this is white; for "white" is predicated of truth, and truth is also represented as white (n. 3301, 3993, 4007, 5319). The good of truth, which 
is signified by "the manna," is now described, both what the quality of the truth therein is, and what the quality of the good therein is. The quality of the truth is described by its being "like coriander 
seed, white," and the quality of the good by "the taste of it being like that of a cake in honey."  [2] The good of truth, which is the good with those who are of the Lord's spiritual kingdom, 
is quite different from the good which is with those who are of the Lord's celestial kingdom. The good of truth which is with those who are of the spiritual kingdom is implanted in the intellectual part, 
for there is formed by the Lord in this part a new will, which is that the man wills to do according to the truth that he has drawn from the teaching of his church; and when he wills and does this 
truth, it becomes with him good, and is called "spiritual good," and also "the good of truth." That this is really truth, he indeed believes, because he has faith from the teaching; but he has no perception 
whether it is true, unless he may seem to himself to have it from the fact that he has confirmed it with himself, partly from the sense of the letter of the Word, and partly from the fallacies 
of ideas that favor his received opinion; not considering that there is nothing which cannot be confirmed, even falsity itself, so as to appear like truth (n. 4741, 5033, 6865, 7012, 7680, 7950). Hence 
it is, that all of every faith believe their own dogmas to be true, even the Socinians, and also the Jews themselves.  [3] From all this it is evident what is the quality of the truth which is turned 
into good in the case of many who are of the church. None of these can see whether the teaching of their church is true, except those who are in the affection of truth for the sake of the uses of 
life. They who have this end in view are continually enlightened by the Lord, not only during their life in the world, but also afterward. These alone are they who can receive; for the Lord leads them 
by means of good, and by means of it gives them to see truth, and thus to believe. From all this it is evident what is the source and what the quality of the good with those who are of the Lord's spiritual 
kingdom. But the good with those who are of the Lord's celestial kingdom is not implanted in the intellectual part, but in the will part. They who are in this good know from internal perception, 
which is from the Lord, whether a thing is true. (On these two kinds of good, and the difference between them, see n. 2046, 2088, 2227, 2669, 2715, 2718, 3235, 3240, 3241, 3246, 4138, 4493, 5113, 6500, 
6865, 7233, 7977, 7992.) </p>

'And it was like coriander seed, white' means the truth within it, that it was pure. This is clear from the meaning of 'seed' as the truth of faith, dealt with in <a href="255.htm">255</a>, <a href="1940.htm">1940</a>, <a href="2848.htm">2848</a>, <a href="3038.htm">3038</a>, <a href="3310.htm">3310</a>, <a href="3373.htm">3373</a>. 'Coriander 
seed' is mentioned because it is white; for 'white' has reference to truth, and in addition truth is represented as being white, <a href="3301.htm">3301</a>, <a href="3993.htm">3993</a>, <a href="4007.htm">4007</a>, <a href="5319.htm">5319</a>. The good of truth, meant by 'the manna', 
is being described now, both the essential nature of the truth in that entity and the essential nature of the good in it. The essential nature of the truth is described by the statement that it was 
'like coriander seed, white' and the essential nature of the good by the statement that 'the taste of it was like that of a cake with honey'. The good of truth, which is good as it exists with those 
who belong to the Lord's spiritual kingdom, is entirely different from good as it exists with those who belong to the Lord's celestial kingdom. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The good of truth existing with those who belong 
to the spiritual kingdom has been implanted in the understanding part of the mind; for in that part the Lord fashions the new will, which exists in a person when he has the will to act in accord with 
the truth he has absorbed from the teachings of his Church. And when he wills and does that truth it becomes good residing with him, which is called spiritual good, and also the good of truth. He indeed 
believes that this is positively the truth, because he has faith in what he has been taught. But he has no perception to see for himself whether it is the truth apart from that which he seems to himself 
to have as a consequence of having proved it for himself, partly from the sense of the letter of the Word and partly from the misconception that lend support to a preconceived notion. He fails 
however to consider that nothing, not even actual falsity, is incapable of receiving proof that makes it look like the truth, <a href="4741.htm">4741</a>, <a href="5033.htm">5033</a>, <a href="6865.htm">6865</a>, <a href="7012.htm">7012</a>, <a href="7680.htm">7680</a>, <a href="7950.htm">7950</a>. So it is that all people without exception, 
including Socinians and also the Jews themselves, believe that their doctrines are the truth. </p>
<p>All this shows the essential nature of the truth that is converted into good with very many members 
of the Church. None among them can see whether a teaching of their Church is true except those who have an affection for truth for the sake of useful services in life. Those who have this end in view 
are enlightened by the Lord constantly, not only while they live in the world but also afterwards. They alone are the ones who are able to receive truth, for the Lord leads them by means of good, and 
through that good He enables them to see truth and so believe it. All this demonstrates the origin and nature of good as it exists with those belonging to the Lord's spiritual kingdom. But good as 
it exists with those belonging to the Lord's celestial kingdom has been implanted not in the understanding part of the mind, but in the will part. Those with whom this good resides know from inward perception 
received from the Lord whether something is true. Regarding good as it exists with the one and as it exists with the other, and the difference between them, see <a href="2046.htm">2046</a>, <a href="2088.htm">2088</a>, <a href="2227.htm">2227</a>, <a href="2669.htm">2669</a>, <a href="2715.htm">2715</a>, <a href="2718.htm">2718</a>, <a href="3235.htm">3235</a>, <a href="3240.htm">3240</a>, <a href="3241.htm">3241</a>, <a href="3246.htm">3246</a>, <a href="4138.htm">4138</a>, <a href="4493.htm">4493</a>, <a href="5113.htm">5113</a>, <a href="6500.htm">6500</a>, <a href="6865.htm">6865</a>, <a href="7233.htm">7233</a>, <a href="7977.htm">7977</a>, <a href="7992.htm">7992</a>. </p>

`Et hoc sicut semen coriandri album': quod significet verum inibi quod purum, constat ex significatione `seminis' quod sit fidei verum, de qua n. 255, 1940, (x)2848, 3038, 3310, 3373; `semen coriandri'
