Verses 31-39. And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned a king over the sons of Israel. And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom; and the name of his city was Dinhabah. 
And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead. And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his stead. And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, 
who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead; and the name of his city was Avith. And Hadad died, and Samlah of Mazrekah reigned in his stead. And Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth 
of the river reigned in his stead. And Shaul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead. And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead; and the name of his city 
was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-zahab. "And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom," signifies the principal truths in the Lord's 
Divine Human; "before there reigned a king over the sons of Israel," signifies when interior spiritual natural truth had not yet risen; "and Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom," signifies the first 
truth; "and the name of his city was Dinhabah," signifies doctrine therefrom; "and Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead," signifies what is therefrom as from its essential, 
and its quality; "and Jobab died, and Husham reigned in his stead," signifies what was therefrom; "of the land of the Temanites," signifies whence it was; "and Husham died, and Hadad the son of 
Bedad reigned in his stead," signifies what was therefrom; "who smote Midian in the field of Moab," signifies purification from falsity; "and the name of his city was Avith," signifies doctrinal things 
therefrom; "and Hadad died, and Samlah of Mazrekah reigned in his stead," signifies what was thence derived and its quality; "and Samlah died, and Shaul reigned in his stead," signifies what was therefrom; 
"of Rehoboth of the river," signifies its quality; "and Shaul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead," signifies what was therefrom, and its quality; "and Baal-hanan the 
son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead," signifies what was therefrom; "and the name of his city was Pau," signifies doctrine; "and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the
