<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6610节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6610.</strong>只要人活着，他的思维观念就会经历变化，也就是说，它们会繁殖和分裂，由此传播到各种不同的社群和新的社群。对那些陷入邪恶的人来说，这些观念会传播到地狱社群，陷入虚假说服的人也是这样。但对那些处于真理说服，也就是说服性信仰的人来说，思维观念极其受限；而对那些正在重生的人来说，思维和情感不断被引入新的天堂社群，它们的传播也会增长。前者的思维和情感也会分裂；并因着分裂而与观念相联，这些观念再次传到新的社群。尤其是，总体真理充满具体方面，这些具体方面又充满特定细节，因而充满新真理，光照由此增多。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6610</b></p><p><b>6610.</b>
So long as a man lives, the ideas of his thought are varied, that is, they are multiplied and divided, and are thus extended to various and new societies; with those who are in evil, to infernal societies, 
as also with those who are in the persuasions of falsity. But with those who are in persuasions of truth, that is, in persuasive faith, the ideas of the thought are exceedingly confined; while 
with those who are being regenerated, the thoughts and affections are continually insinuated into new heavenly societies, and the extension increases. The former thoughts and affections are also divided; 
and being divided, are associated with ideas, which are again communicated to new societies. More especially generals are filled with particulars, and these with singulars, thus with new truths, whereby 
the illumination increases. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6610</b></p><p><b>6610.</b>
As long as a person lives the ideas constituting his thought Undergo variation; that is to say, they multiply and divide, and by doing this they spread to different kinds of communities and to new ones. 
In the case of people who are under the influence of evil those ideas spread to communities in hell, as the ideas likewise do in the case of those subject to persuasive arguments upholding what is 
false. In the case however of those subject to persuasive arguments upholding what is true, which is persuasive faith. the ideas constituting thought are exceedingly restricted. But in the case of those 
who are being regenerated the thoughts and affections are constantly being introduced into new heavenly communities, and the spread of them increases. Also the thoughts and affections which already 
exist divide, and when they have divided they become linked to ideas which are again communicated to new communities. In particular general truths are filled in with particular aspects, and these with 
specific details, thus with new truths which provide increasing enlightenment.  </p>

Quamdiu homo vivit, ideae ejus cogitationis variantur, nempe multiplicantur (c)et dividuntur, ac ita extenduntur ad varias societates et novas; apud illos qui in malo sunt, ad societates infernales, 
similiter apud illos qui in persuasionibus falsi; apud illos autem qui in persuasionibus veri, {1}hoc est, qui in fide persuasiva, ideae cogitationis valde coarctantur.  Ast apud illos qui regenerantur, 
cogitationes et affectiones continue insinuantur in novas societates caelestes, et crescit extensio; et quoque priores cogitationes et affectiones dividuntur, et {2}divisae associantur ideis quae 
cum novis iterum societatibus {3}communicantur; imprimis implentur communia particularibus, et haec singularibus, ita (t)veritatibus novis ex quibus illuminatio crescit. @1 sunt, ita$ @2 sic$ @3 communicant$ </p>
