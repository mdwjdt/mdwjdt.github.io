<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8585节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8585.</strong>“摩西就在以色列的长老眼前这样行了”表通过首要真理所实现的结果。这从“摩西就这样行了”和“以色列的长老”的含义清楚可知：“摩西就这样行了”是指结果；“以色列的长老”是指首要真理（参看<a href="8578.htm">8578</a>节）。前面经上之所以说摩西要带着以色列的几个长老，而现在说他在以色列的长老眼前这样行了，是因为信通过真理，事实上通过首要真理被赋予；事实上，启示或光照凭这些真理而得以实现，以便从它们所流出的真理，就是所谓的次要真理能清晰地被感知到。</p>

And Moses did so before the eyes of the elders of Israel. That this signifies the effect by means of primary truths, is evident from the signification of "Moses did so," as being the effect; and from 
the signification of "the elders of Israel," as being primary truths (see n. 8578). It was previously said that Moses should "take with him of the elders of Israel," and now that he did so "in the sight 
of the elders of Israel," because faith is given by means of truth, and indeed by means of primary truths; for enlightenment is effected by virtue of these, so that the truths flowing from them, which 
are called "secondary," may be clearly perceived. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8585</b></p><p><b>8585.</b>
And Moses did so before the eyes of the elders of Israel' means the accomplishment by means of leading truths. This is clear from the meaning of 'Moses did so' as the accomplishment; and from the meaning 
of 'the elders of Israel' as leading truths, dealt with above in <a href="8578.htm">8578</a>. The reason why previously it said that Moses was to take with him some of the elders of Israel, and now that he did so before 
the eyes of the elders of Israel, is that faith is imparted through truths, and in fact through leading ones since they shed light that allows clear perception of the truths flowing from them, called 
secondary truths. </p>

</p><b>8585.</b>
`Et fecit ita Moscheh ad oculos seniorum Israelis': quod significet effectum per primaria vera, constat ex significatione `fecit ita Moscheh' quod sit effectus, et ex significatione `seniorum Israelis' 
quod sint primaria vera, de qua supra n. 8578.  Quod prius dictum sit quod Moscheh acciperet secum de senioribus Israelis, et nunc quod fecerit ita ad oculos seniorum Israelis, est quia fides datur 
per vera, et quidem per primaria, nam ex illis fit illustratio, ut vera inde fluentia, quae vocantur secundaria, clare percipiantur. </p>
