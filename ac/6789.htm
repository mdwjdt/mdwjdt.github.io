<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6789节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6789.</strong>“他在哪里？你们为什么撇下那人呢”表没有那真理，他们如何与教会的良善结合呢？这从埃及人和“你们为什么撇下那人”的含义清楚可知：埃及人，即此处她们所撇下的“那人”，是指真正的记忆知识（参看<a href="6784.htm">6784</a>节）；“你们为什么撇下那人”是指没有真理，他们如何与良善结合呢？因为“撇下那人”在此是指不能结合。<br />有必要解释一下这一切的本质。此处由“摩西”所代表的真正记忆知识是外在教会的真理；这真理是由从神来的律法所拥有的真理产生的；后一种真理也由“摩西”来代表（<a href="6771.htm">6771</a>，<a href="6780.htm">6780</a>节）；从神来的律法所拥有的真理是内在教会的真理。外在真理若不源于内在真理，就无法与良善结合。以圣言为例来说明这一点。除非圣言的内在流入那些阅读圣言，却局限于字义的人中间，否则，来自圣言的真理就不会与良善结合。当人视圣言为神圣时，圣言的内在就会流入进来，并与良善结合；当他处于良善时，就会视圣言为神圣。<br />再以圣餐为例来说明这个问题。几乎没有人知道圣餐中的“饼”表示主对全人类的爱，以及人对那爱的回报；“酒”表示仁爱。尽管如此，那些以神圣的方式领受饼和酒的人仍能通过这些与天堂和主联结；爱与仁之良善通过天使流入；那时，天使不会想到饼和酒，而会想到爱与仁（<a href="3464.htm">3464</a>，<a href="3735.htm">3735</a>，<a href="5915.htm">5915</a>节）。由此可见，当人处于良善时，外在真理就会在他不知不觉的情况下与内在真理结合。</p>

And where is he? Why is this that ye have left the man? That this signifies how without that truth could they be conjoined with the good of the church, is evident from the signification of an "Egyptian," 
who is here "the man whom they had left," as being true memory-knowledge (see n. 6784); and from the signification of "why is this that ye have left the man?" as being how without that truth could 
they be conjoined with good, for "to leave the man" here denotes not to be able to be conjoined. [2] How the case herein is, shall be told. True memory-knowledge, which is here represented by Moses, 
is the truth of the external church; this truth arises from the truth which is of the law from the Divine, which truth also is "Moses" (n. 6771, 6780), and the truth which is of the law from the Divine 
is the truth of the internal church. Unless external truth is from internal truth, it cannot be conjoined with good. Take the Word as an illustration. Unless the internal of the Word flows in with 
those who read the Word and abide in the literal sense, no conjunction is effected of truth from the Word with good; and the internal of the Word flows in and is conjoined with good when the man esteems 
the Word holy; and he esteems it holy when he is in good. [3] Take as another illustration the Holy Supper. Scarcely any know that the "bread" therein signifies the Lord's love toward the universal 
human race, and the reciprocity of man; and that the "wine" signifies charity. Nevertheless, with those who receive the bread and wine holily, conjunction is effected with heaven and with the Lord 
through these; and the goods of love and charity flow in through the angels, who then do not think of bread and wine, but of love and charity (n. 3464, 3735, 5915). Hence it is evident that external truth 
is conjoined with internal truth when the man is in good, without his knowing it. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6789</b></p><p><b>6789.</b>
'And where is he? Why is it that you left the man?' means, In what way without that truth could they be joined to the good of the Church? This is clear from the meaning of an Egyptian man, to whom 'the 
man they left' refers here, as true factual knowledge, dealt with above in <a href="6784.htm">6784</a>; and from the meaning of 'Why is it that you left the man?' as, In what way without that truth could they be joined to 
good? For 'leaving the man' here is not being able to be joined. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But the nature of all this needs to be explained. True factual knowledge, represented here by 'Moses', is truth as the external 
Church knows it. This truth depends for its existence on the truth which the law from God possesses, which too 'Moses' represents, <a href="6771.htm">6771</a>, <a href="6780.htm">6780</a>; and the truth that the law from God possesses is truth 
as the internal Church knows it. Unless external truth springs from internal truth it cannot be joined to good. Let the Word serve to illustrate this. But for the influence of the inner spirit of the 
Word received by those who read the Word and yet confine themselves to the literal sense, truth from the Word does not become joined to good. The inner spirit of the Word influences a person and becomes 
joined to good when he considers the Word to be holy; and he considers it to be holy when he is governed by good.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Let the Holy Supper also serve to illustrate the matter. Scarcely any know 
that the bread there means the Lord's love towards the entire human race and man's reciprocation of that love, and that the wine means charity Even so, those who receive the bread and wine in a holy manner 
are joined by means of them to heaven and the Lord; and through the angels - who do not think at that time about bread and wine, only about love and charity, <a href="3464.htm">3464</a>, <a href="3735.htm">3735</a>, <a href="5915.htm">5915</a> - different forms of 
the good of love and charity flow in. From this one may see that when a person is governed by good external truth is joined to internal truth, without his knowing it. </p>

`Et ubi ille? quare hoc reliquistis virum?': quod significet quomodo absque illo vero conjungi possent bono Ecclesiae, constat ex significatione `viri Aegyptii,' qui hic est {1} vir quem reliquerunt, 
quod sit verum scientificum, de qua supra n. 6784; et ex significatione `quare hoc reliquistis virum?' quod sit quomodo absque illo vero conjungi possent bono, nam `relinquere virum' hic est non posse 
conjungi. 	2 {2}Hoc quomodo se habet, dicendum: verum scientificum, quod hic per `Moschen,' repraesentatur est verum Ecclesiae externae; hoc verum {3} existit a vero quod legis a Divino, quod quoque 
est Moscheh, n. 6771, 6780, et verum quod legis ex Divino est verum {4}Ecclesiae internae, verum externum nisi sit ex vero interno, non conjungi potest bono; {5} (m)sit illustrationi Verbum: nisi internum 
Verbi influat apud illos qui legunt Verbum et manent in sensu {6} litterali, non fit conjunctio veri ex Verbo cum bono, et tunc internum Verbi influit, et conjungitur cum bono, cum homo Verbum 
sanctum habet, et 3 tunc sanctum habet cum est in bono;(n) sit illustrationi etiam Sancta Cena: vix aliqui sciunt  quod panis ibi significet amorem Domini erga universum genus humanum, et reciprocum 
hominis, et quod vinum significet charitatem;  sed  usque qui sancte recipiunt illa, illis est conjunctio cum caelo et cum Domino per illa, et influunt bona amoris et charitatis per angelos, qui tunc 
non cogitant de pane (c)et vino, sed de amore et charitate, {7}n. 3464, 3735, 5915; inde patet quod {8}verum externum conjungatur cum vero interno, cum homo in bono est, illo nesciente. 	@1 i ille et$ 	@2
