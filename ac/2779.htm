Verse 3. And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his boys with him, and Isaac his son; and he clave the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose up, and went unto the 
place of which God told him. "And Abraham rose early in the morning," signifies a state of peace and innocence; "and saddled his ass," signifies the natural man which He prepared; "and took two of his 
boys," signifies the former rational which He had adjoined; "and Isaac his son," signifies the Divine rational begotten by Himself; "and he clave the wood for the burnt-offering," signifies the merit 
of righteousness; "and rose up," signifies elevation; "and went unto the place of which God told him," signifies the state at that time according to perception. </p>

Verse 3 And in the morning Abraham rose up early, and saddled his ass, and took two of his servants with him, and Isaac his son, and split the pieces of wood for the burnt offering, and rose up and went 
to the place of which God had told him. </p>
<p>'In the morning Abraham rose up early' means a state of peace and innocence. 'And saddled his ass' means the natural man which He prepared. 'And took two 
servants' means the first rational which He had allied to it. 'And Isaac his son' means the Divine Rational begotten from Himself. 'And split the pieces of wood for the burnt offering' means the merit 
of righteousness. 'And rose up' means being raised up. 'And went to the place of which God had told him' means the state at that time according to perception. </p>

Vers. 3.  Et mane surrexit Abraham in matutino, et instravit asinum suum, et accepit duos pueros suos secum, et Jishakum filium suum, et fidit ligna holocausti, et surrexit, et ivit ad locum quem dixit 
ei Deus. 'Mane surrexit Abraham in matutino' significat statum pacis et innocentiae: `et instravit asinum suum' significat naturalem hominem quem praeparavit: `et accepit duos pueros' significat rationale 
prius quod adjunxit: `et Jishakum filium suum' significat Rationale Divinum a se genitum: `et fidit ligna holocausti' significat meritum justitiae: `et surrexit' significat elevationem: `et ivit 
ad locum quem dixit ei Deus' significat statum tunc secundum perceptionem.   </p>
