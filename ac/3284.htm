<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3284.</strong>创世记25:21-23. 以撒因他妻子不生育，就为她祈求耶和华。耶和华应允他的祈求，他的妻子利百加就怀了孕。儿子们在她腹中彼此相争，她就说，若是这样，我为什么如此呢？她就去求问耶和华。 耶和华对她说，两族在你肚里，两民要从你腹中分立；这民必强于那民，大的必服事小的。<br />“以撒祈求耶和华”表为儿子的神性与为父亲的神性的交流。“因他妻子不生育，就为她”表神圣属世人尚不存在。“耶和华应允他的祈求”表付诸实施。“他的妻子利百加就怀了孕”表来自为母亲的神性真理。“儿子们在她腹中彼此相争”表争斗，也就是此处的主题。“她就说，若是这样，我为什么如此呢”表悲痛。“她就去求问耶和华”表交流的状态。“耶和华对她说”表来自神性的直觉。“两族在你肚里”表属世人的内部和外部良善，也就是怀孕。“两民要从你腹中分立”表由此产生的真理。“这民必强于那民”表一开始真理会胜过真理的良善。“大的必服事小的”表真理的良善有一段时间是服从的。</p>

Verses 21-23. And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his woman, because she was barren, and Jehovah was entreated of him, and Rebekah his woman conceived. And the sons struggled together within her; and she 
said, If so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of Jehovah. And Jehovah said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels, and the one people shall prevail 
over the other people, and the elder shall serve the younger. "And Isaac entreated Jehovah," signifies the communication of the Divine which was the Son with the Divine which was the Father; "for 
his woman, because she was barren," signifies that the Divine natural was not yet; "and Jehovah was entreated of him," signifies the effect; "and Rebekah his woman conceived," signifies that it was 
from Divine truth as a mother; "and the sons struggled together within her," signifies combat as to which; "and she said, If so, why am I thus?" signifies straitness; "and she went to inquire of Jehovah," 
signifies a state of communication; "and Jehovah said unto her," signifies perception from the Divine; "two nations are in thy womb," signifies the natural as to interior and exterior good, that 
there is conception; "and two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels" signifies that truth is thence derived; "and the one people shall prevail over the other people," signifies that at first truth 
will be superior to the good of truth; "and the elder shall serve the younger," signifies that for a time the good of truth will be inferior. </p>

Verses 21-23 And Isaac prayed to Jehovah on behalf of his wife because she was barren; and Jehovah granted his prayer, and Rebekah his wife conceived. And the sons struggled together within her, and 
she said, If this is so, why am I [going through this]? And she went to inquire of Jehovah. And Jehovah said to her, Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples will be separated from your bowels, and 
lone] people will prevail over [the other] people, and the greater will serve the less. </p>
<p>'Isaac prayed to Jehovah' means communication of the Divine which is the Son with the Divine which is the 
Father. 'On behalf of his wife because she was barren' means that the Divine Natural did not as yet exist. 'And Jehovah granted his prayer' means carried into effect. 'And Rebekah his wife conceived' 
means from Divine Truth as the mother. 'And the sons struggled together within her' means conflict, which is the subject here. 'And she said, If this is so, why am I [going through this]?' means distress. 
'And she went to inquire of Jehovah' means a state of communication. 'And Jehovah said to her' means perception from the Divine. 'Two nations are in your womb' means the natural as regards good, 
interior and exterior, which is conception. 'And two peoples will be separated from your bowels' means resulting truth. 'And [one] people will prevail over [the other] people' means that at first truth 
must be superior to the good of truth. 'And the greater will serve the less' means that the good of truth must for a time be subordinate. </p>

Vers.  21-23.  Et oravit Jishak ad Jehovam propter mulierem suam, quia sterilis ea, et exoratus illi Jehovah, et concepit Rebecca mulier ejus. Et collidebant se filii in medio illius; et dixit, Si ita, 
ad quid hoc, ego? et ivit ad interrogandum Jehovam. Et dixit Jehovah illi, Duae gentes in utero tuo, et duo populi e visceribus tuis separabuntur, et populus prae populo valebit, et major serviet 
minori. `Oravit Jishak ad Jehovam' significat communicationem Divini quod Filius cum Divino quod Pater: `propter mulierem quod sterilis ea' significat quod nondum Divinum Naturale: `et exoratus illi Jehovah' 
significat effectum; `et concepit Rebecca mulier ejus' significat quod ex Divino Vero ut a matre: `et collidebant se filii in medio illius' significat pugnam de qua: `et dixit, Si ita, ad quid 
hoc, ego?' significat angustiam: `et ivit ad interrogandum Jehovam' significat statum communicationis: `et dixit Jehovah illi' significat perceptionem ex Divino: `Duae gentes in utero tuo' significat 
naturale quoad bonum interius et exterius, quod conceptio: `et duo populi e visceribus tuis separabuntur' significat quod inde verum: `et populus prae populo valebit' significat quod primo verum erit 
superius quam bonum veri: `et major serviet minori' significat quod bonum veri inferius erit ad tempus. </p>
