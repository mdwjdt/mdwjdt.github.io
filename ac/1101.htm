<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1101节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1101.</strong>愿神使雅弗扩张”表该教会的启示。“扩张”的字义表扩张边界，而内义则表要得到启示。事实上，启示可以说是扩张聪明智慧的边界。如以赛亚书：<br />要扩张你帐幕之地，张大你居所的幔子。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛54.2.htm">54:2</a>）<br />这表示属灵事物上的启示。当外在教会成员接受信之真理与良善的指教时，他就被“扩张”了。由于仁爱存在于他里面，所以他由此确认得越来越多。此外，他接受的指教越多，其心智的觉知部分，也就是说仁爱和良知存于其中的觉知部分的云层越被驱散。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1101.</strong> May God broaden Japheth! symbolizes that church's enlightenment. In a literal sense broadening means enlarging the borders, but in an inner sense it means being enlightened. Being enlightened is like having the borders of one's wisdom and understanding enlarged, as in Isaiah:<br />Broaden the place of your tent, and let the tent curtains of your dwellings stretch out. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1101/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_54_2" target=_top>Isaiah 54:2</a>)<br />This stands for being enlightened in spiritual matters.<br />People in the outer church are broadened when they learn about the true ideas and good impulses of faith, and since they are under the influence of charity, they grow more and more convinced of what they learn. The more they learn, the more it scatters the clouds obscuring their intellectual side, which houses their charity and conscience. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1101</b></p><p><b>1101.</b>
May God enlarge Japheth, signifies the enlightenment of this church. In the literal sense "to enlarge" is to extend the boundaries, but in the internal sense it is to be enlightened; for enlightenment 
is the enlargement, as it were, of the boundaries of wisdom and intelligence. As in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations (Isa. 54:2), meaning 
enlightenment in spiritual things. The man of the external church is "enlarged" when he is instructed in the truths and goods of faith; and as he is in charity, he is thereby more and more 
confirmed; and besides, the more he is instructed, the more is the cloud of his intellectual part dispersed-of that intellectual part, that is to say, in which are charity and conscience. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1101</b></p><p><b>1101.</b>
'May God enlarge Japheth' means the enlightenment of that Church. In the literal sense 'enlarging' means extending boundaries, but in the internal sense it means being enlightened. Indeed enlightenment 
is an extension so to speak of the boundaries of wisdom and intelligence, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Enlarge the place of your tent, and let the curtains of your habitations be stretched out. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2054:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 54:2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This 
stands for enlightenment in spiritual things. The member of the external Church is 'enlarged' when he receives instruction in truths and goods of faith. And because charity is present in him he is 
by this means confirmed more and more. Also, the more instruction he receives the more the cloud is dispersed in the understanding part of his mind in which charity and conscience are present. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1101</b>
</p><b>1101.</b>
'Dilatet Deus Japhetum': quod significet illustrationem ejus; in sensu litterali 'dilatare' significat amplificare terminos, sed in sensu interno illustrari; illustratio enim est amplificatio quas terminorum 
sapientiae et intelligentiae, ut apud Esaiam, 	Dilata locum tentorii tui, et cortinas habitaculorum tuorum extendant, liv 2; </p>
<p>pro illustratione in spiritualibus. 'Dilatatur' homo Ecclesiae 
externae cum instruitur in veris et bonis fidei; et quia in charitate est, inde magis et magis confirmatur; quoque magis instruitur, eo magis discutitur nubes partis ejus intellectualis in qua charitas 
et conscientia. </p>
