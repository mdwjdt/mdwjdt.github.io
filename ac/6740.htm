<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6740节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6740.</strong>“我从希伯来妇人中去给你叫一个妇人，一个奶妈来，”表对来自真正教会的良善要被灌输给它的一种觉知。这从“一个妇人，一个奶妈”和“希伯来妇人”的含义清楚可知：“一个妇人，一个奶妈”是指良善的灌输（参看<a href="4563.htm">4563</a>节），因为奶妈温柔灌入的“奶”表示真理之良善，或也可说，属天-属灵层（<a href="2184.htm">2184</a>节）；“希伯来妇人”是指构成教会的事物（<a href="6675.htm">6675</a>，<a href="6684.htm">6684</a>节）。“我去叫，可以吗”之所以表示对来自真正教会的良善要被灌输的一种觉知，是因为就内义而言，所指的是拥有觉知的良善之真理；而就字义而言，所指的是没有这种觉知的女孩。“奶妈”（经上或译乳母）表示良善的灌输，这一点也明显可见于以赛亚书：<br />他们必将你的众子怀中抱来，将你的众女肩上扛来。列王必作你的养父，王后必作你的乳母。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.22.htm">49:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.23.htm">23</a>）<br />“列王必作你的养父”表示属于聪明的真理的灌输；“王后必作你的乳母”表示属于智慧的良善的灌输。同一先知书：<br />你举目向四围观看，众人都聚集来到你这里。你的众子从远方而来，你的众女也被乳母怀抱而来。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.4.htm">60:4</a>）<br />“从远方而来的众子”表示外邦人当中的真理，经上说这些真理“从远方而来”，是因为它们远离教会的真理；“被乳母怀抱而来的众女”表示不断被灌输的良善，因为“女儿”是指良善，“乳母”是指那些灌输的人。</p>

Shall I go and call thee a woman a nurse from the Hebrew women? That this signifies perception that there was to be instilled therein good from the church itself, is evident from the signification of 
"a woman, a nurse," as being the instilling of good (see n. 4563), for by the milk which the nurse gently introduces is signified the good of truth, or what is the same, the celestial spiritual (n. 2184); 
and from the signification of "the Hebrew women," as being the things of the church (n. 6675, 6684). Its being a perception that good thence derived was to be instilled is signified by her saying, 
"Shall I go and call?" because in the internal sense the truth of good which has perception is meant; but in the sense of the letter is meant a girl who had no perception. That a "nurse" denotes the 
instilling of good, is plain also in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     They shall bring thy sons in their bosom, and thy daughters shall be carried upon the shoulder. And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens 
thy nursing mothers (Isa. 49:22-23); </p>
<p>"kings shall be thy nursing fathers" denotes the instilling of truth, which is of intelligence; "queens, nursing mothers," denotes the instilling of good, which 
is of wisdom.      Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all are gathered together, they come to thee; thy sons come from far, and thy daughters are carried by nurses at the side (Isa. 60:4); </p>
<p>"sons 
who come from far" denote truths with the Gentiles, which being far off from the truth of the church, are said to "come from far;" "daughters that are carried by nurses at the side" denote the 
goods which are continually being instilled; for "daughters" are goods, and "nurses" they who insinuate. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6740</b></p><p><b>6740.</b>
'Shall I go and call you a woman, a wet nurse, from the Hebrew women?' means a perception that good from the true Church should be instilled into it. This is clear from the meaning of 'a woman, a wet 
nurse as the instillation of good, dealt with in <a href="4563.htm">4563</a>, for 'the milk' instilled by a wet nurse means the good of truth or, what amounts to the same thing, the celestial-spiritual, <a href="2184.htm">2184</a>, and from the 
meaning of 'the Hebrew women' as things that constitute the Church, dealt with in <a href="6675.htm">6675</a>, <a href="6684.htm">6684</a>. A perception that good from the true Church should be instilled is meant by '[his sister] said, Shall I go 
and call?' because in the internal sense the truth of good which has perception is meant by her, whereas in the sense of the letter the girl herself who had no such perception is meant. The fact that 
'a nurse' means the instillation of good is also evident in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
They will bring your sons in their bosom, and your daughters will be carried on their shoulder. And kings will be your foster fathers 
(nutricius) and their queens your nurses (nutrix). <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2049:22,%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 49:22, 23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Kings who are foster fathers' stands for the instillation of truth that belongs to intelligence, 'queens who are nurses' for 
the instillation of good that belongs to wisdom. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Lift up your eyes round about and see; they all gather together, they come to you. Your sons come from afar, and your daughters 
are carried at the side by nurses. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2060:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 60:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Sons who come from afar' stands for truths among gentiles, who are said 'to come from afar' because they are remote from the Church's truth. 'Daughters 
who are carried at the side by nurses' stands for forms of good which are constantly being instilled, 'daughters' being forms of good and 'nurses' those who instill.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 6740</b>
</p><b>6740.</b>
`Num ibo et vocabo tibi mulierem nutricem ex Hebraeis?': quod significet perceptionem quod insinuandum ei bonum ab ipsa Ecclesia, constat ex significatione `mulieris nutricis' quod sit insinuatio boni, 
de qua n. 4563, nam per `lac' quod nutrix insinuat significatur bonum veri, seu quod idem, caeleste spirituale, n. 2184; et ex significatione `Hebraearum' quod sint illa quae sunt Ecclesiae, de qua 
n. 6675, 6684; quod sit perceptio quod insinuandum bonum inde, significatur per `dixit, Num ibo et vocabo?' nam in sensu interno intelligitur verum boni cui est perceptio, in sensu autem litterae intelligitur 
puella, cui non perceptio.  `Nutrix' quod sit insinuatio boni, patet quoque apud Esaiam, Afferent filios tuos in sinu, et filiae tuae super humero apportabuntur; et erunt reges nutricii tui, 
et dominae illorum nutrices (x)tuae, xlix 22, 23; </p>
<p>`reges nutricii' pro insinuatione veri quod intelligentiae; `dominae nutrices' pro insinuatione boni quod sapientiae: apud eundem, Attolle oculos 
tuos circumcirca et vide, omnes congregantur, veniunt ad te, filii tui e longinquo veniunt, et filiae tuae ad latus a nutricibus apportantur, lx 4; </p>
<p>`filii qui e longinquo veniunt' pro veris apud gentes 
quae quia procul a vero Ecclesiae sunt, dicuntur `e longinquo venire'; `filiae quae ad latus a nutricibus apportantur' pro bonis quae continue insinuantur; sunt enim `filiae' bona, et `nutrices' quae 
insinuant. </p>
