<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1652.</strong>外在人的良善与真理仅表面上看似良善与真理，主在童年时正是凭它们与恶和假争战。表面的良善与真理以1节所提及的各王来表示；恶和假以2节所提及的各王来表示；这些恶和假是不洁的（3节）。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1652.</strong> The goodness and truth present in his outer self 钬?which merely appeared to be good and true 钬?were the weapons the Lord used during his youth in his combat against evil and falsity. The kings named in verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1652/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_1" target=_top>1</a> symbolize apparent goodness and truth, while those named in verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1652/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_2" target=_top>2</a> symbolize the evil and falsity he fought against. The latter were unclean (verse 3). </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1652</b></p><p><b>1652.</b>
The goods and truths in the external man, but which only appeared as goods and truths, were the things from which the Lord fought in His childhood against evils and falsities. The apparent goods and 
truths are signified by the kings named in verse 1; but the evils and falsities against which He fought are signified by the kings named in verse 2; and these were unclean (verse 3). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1652</b></p><p><b>1652.</b>
It was from the goods and truths residing with the External Man (which were goods and truths solely in their outward appearance) that the Lord in childhood fought against evils and falsities. Such apparent 
goods and truths are meant by the kings mentioned in verse 1, while the evils and falsities against which conflict took place are meant by the kings mentioned in verse 2. These evils and falsities 
were unclean, verse 3. </p>

</p><b>1652.</b>
Bona et vera quae apud Externum Hominem, sed apparentia ut bona et vera, fuerunt, ex quibus Dominus in pueritia pugnavit contra mala et falsa.  Bona et vera apparentia significantur per 'reges' nominatos, 
vers. 1: at mala et falsa contra quae pugnatum, significantur per 'reges' nominatos, vers. 2: et quod haec immunda essent, vers. 3. </p>
