<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3655节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3655.</strong>马太福音24章前几节论述的主题是教会败坏的第一和第二个状态。第一个状态就在于他们开始不再知道何为良善、何为真理，并就此彼此争论，结果导致虚假出现（<a href="3354.htm">3354</a>节）。第二个状态在于他们蔑视良善与真理，还排斥它们，因而在于对主的信仰随着仁爱不复存在而逐渐灭亡之际（参看<a href="3487.htm">3487</a>，<a href="3488.htm">3488</a>节）。所以，本序言所论述的主题是教会第三个状态，也就是它在良善与真理上荒凉的状态。</p>

The subject treated of in the preceding verses from the evangelist, was the first and second state of the church's perversion. That the first state consisted in their beginning no longer to know what 
is good and what is true, and in disputing together about them, whence came falsities, may be seen above (n. 3354); and that the second state consisted in their despising what is good and true, and also 
in being averse thereto, and thus in the dying out of faith in the Lord, according to the degrees of the cessation of charity, may be seen above (n. 3487, 3488). So that the subject treated of in 
this preface is the third state of the church, which is its state of desolation in respect to good and truth.            GENESIS 28 </p>
<p>     1. And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and commanded 
him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a woman of the daughters of Canaan.      2. Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father, and take thee from thence a woman of the 
daughters of Laban, thy mother's brother.      3. And God Shaddai will bless thee, and will make thee fruitful and multiply thee, and thou shalt be a company of peoples.      4. And He will give thee 
the blessing of Abraham, to thee and to thy seed with thee, to cause thee to inherit the land of thy sojournings, which God gave unto Abraham.      5. And Isaac sent away Jacob; and he went to Paddan-aram, 
to Laban the son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.      6. And Esau saw that Isaac blessed Jacob, and sent him to Paddan-aram, to take him from thence 
a woman, and in blessing him commanded him, saying, Thou shalt not take a woman of the daughters of Canaan.      7. And Jacob hearkened to his father and to his mother, and went to Paddan-aram.  
    8. And Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan were evil in the eyes of Isaac his father.      9. And Esau went to Ishmael, and took Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister 
of Nebaioth, over his women to himself for a woman.      10. And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.      11. And he lighted upon a place, and passed the night there, for the sun was 
set; and he took of the stones of the place, and placed them for his pillows, and lay down in that place.      12. And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set on the earth, and its head reaching to heaven; 
and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.      13. And behold Jehovah standing upon it; and He said, I am Jehovah the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac; the land 
whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed.      14. And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt break forth to the sea, and to the east, and to the north, and to 
the south; and in thee shall all the families of the ground be blessed, and in thy seed.      15. And behold I am with thee, and will keep thee whithersoever thou goest, and will bring thee back to 
this ground; for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee.      16. And Jacob awoke out of his sleep, and he said, Surely Jehovah is in this place; and I knew it not.  
    17. And he feared, and said, How terrible is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.      18. And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the 
stone that he had placed for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the head of it.      19. And he called the name of that place Bethel; but the name of the city was Luz at the 
first.      20. And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me and will keep me in this way wherein I walk, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on.      21. And I return in peace 
to my father's house, Jehovah shall be to me for God.      22. And this stone which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house; and all that Thou shalt give me, tithing I will tithe it to Thee. </p>

The subject in the previous sections of Matthew <a href="24.htm">24</a> has been the first and second states of the perversion of the Church. The first state exists when people cease to know any longer what good is or what 
truth is, and instead argue with one another about these, as a result of which falsities arise, see <a href="3354.htm">3354</a>. And the second state exists when they treat good and truth with contempt and also reject them, 
and so when belief in the Lord breathes its last, which things take place step by step as charity ceases to exist, see <a href="3487.htm">3487</a>, <a href="3488.htm">3488</a>. Here the third state is now dealt with, which exists when good and 
truth in the Church are made desolate. </p>

In illis quae apud Evangelistam praecedunt, actum est de primo et secundo statu perversionis Ecclesiae; quod primus status fuerit quod non amplius inciperent scire quid bonum et quid verum, sed de illis 
litigarent inter se, a quibus falsitates, videatur n. 3354; et quod secundus status fuerit quod bonum et verum contempturi, et quoque quod aversaturi, et sic quod exspiratura fides in Dominum, secundum 
gradus sicut cessatura charitas, videatur n. 3487, 3488:  hic nunc est tertius status de quo agitur, qui est desolationis Ecclesiae quoad bonum et verum. </p>

<p>1. 
  Et vocavit Jischak ad Jacobum, et benedixit illi, et praecepit illi, et dixit illi, Non accipies mulierem e filiabus Canaan. 2.   Surge, vade Paddanem Aram, domum Bethuelis patris matris 
tuae, et accipe tibi exinde mulierem a filiabus Labanis fratris matris tuae. 3.   Et DEUS Shaddai benedicet tibi, et faciet fructificari te, et multiplicari te; et eris in coetum populorum. 4.   Et 
dabit tibi benedictionem Abrahami, tibi et semini tuo cum te, ad hereditandum te terram peregrinationum tuarum, quam dedit DEUS Abrahamo. 5.   Et misit Jischak Jacobum, et ivit Paddanem Aram, ad Labanem 
filium Bethuelis Aramaei, fratrem Rebeccae matris Jacobi et Esavi. 6.   Et vidit Esau, quod benedixerit Jischak Jacobo, et miserit illum Paddanem Aram, ad accipiendum sibi exinde mulierem, in benedicendo 
eum illi, et praeceperit super illum, dicendo, Non accipies mulierem e filiabus Canaan. 7.   Et audiverit Jacob ad patrem suum, et ad matrem suam, et iverit Paddanem Aram. 8.   Et vidit Esau, 
quod malae filiae Canaan in oculis Jischaki patris sui. 9.   Et ivit Esau ad Jishmael, et accepit Mahalath filiam Jishmaelis filii Abrahami, sororem Nebaioth, super feminas suas sibi ad {1}mulierem.  
                   *    *    *    * 10.  Et exivit Jacob e Beersheba, et ivit Haranem. 11.  Et incidit in locum, et pernoctavit ibi, quia occidit sol, et sumpsit de lapidibus loci, et posuit subcapitalia 
sua, et cubuit in loco illo. 12.  Et somniavit; et ecce scala statuta terrae, et caput ejus pertingens caelum, et ecce angeli DEI ascendentes et descendentes in illa. 13.  Et ecce JEHOVAH 
stans super illa, et dixit, Ego JEHOVAH DEUS Abrahami patris tui, et DEUS Jischaki; terram qua tu cubans super ea, tibi dabo eam, et semini tuo. 14.  Et erit semen tuum, sicut pulvis terrae, et erumpes 
ad mare, et ad orientem, et ad septentrionem, et ad meridiem; et benedicentur in te omnes familiae {2}humi, et in semine tuo. 15.  Et ecce Ego cum te, et custodiam te in omni quo eas, et reducam 
te ad humum hanc, quia non relinquam te, donec quod fecero quod locutus sum tibi. 16.  Et expergefactus Jacob e somno suo, et dixit, Certe est JEHOVAH in loco hoc, et ego non scivi. 17.  Et timuit, 
et dixit, Quam terribilis Locus hic, nihil hic nisi domus DEI, et haec porta caeli. 18.  Et mane surrexit Jacob in matutino, et sumpsit lapidem, quem posuit subcapitalia sua, et posuit illum statuam, 
et fudit oleum super caput illius. 19.  Et vocavit nomen loci illius Bethel; et utique Luz nomen urbis priore. 20.  Et vovit Jacob votum, dicendo, Si fuerit DEUS cum me, et custodiverit me in via 
hac, quam ego ambulans, et dederit mihi panem ad edendum, et vestem ad induendum. 21.  Et rediero in pace ad domum patris mei, et erit JEHOVAH mihi in DEUM. 22.  Et lapis hic, quem posui statuam, erit 
Domus DEI, et omne quod dederis mihi, decimando decimabo illud tibi. @1 so A but d uxorem$ @2 so A but d terrae$ </p>
