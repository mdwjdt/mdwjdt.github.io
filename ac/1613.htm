<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1613.</strong>“纵横”表这国的属天维度和属灵维度，或也可说良善与真理。“纵（即长）”表良善，“横（即宽）”表真理（参看<a href="650.htm">650</a>节）。原因在于，“地”表天国或教会，它的属性并非长（纵）和宽（横），而只是那些与它们相匹配和对应的事物，也就是说，是良善与真理。属天的维度，或良善因是主要的，故好比长（纵），而属灵的维度，或真理因是次要的，故好比宽（横）。<br />“宽”是指真理，这从圣言的预言部分很明显地看出来。如哈巴谷书：<br />我必兴起迦勒底人，就是那残忍暴躁之民，横跨这地。（哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈1.6.htm">1:6</a>）<br />“迦勒底人”表受虚假影响的人，“横跨这地”表毁灭真理，因为这些话论及迦勒底人。诗篇：<br />耶和华啊，你未曾把我交在仇敌手里；你使我的脚站在宽阔之处。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗31.8.htm">31:8</a>）<br />“站在宽阔之处”表处于真理。<br />我在急难中求告耶和华，祂就应允我，把我安置在宽阔之地。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗118.5.htm">118:5</a>）<br />“应允安置在宽阔之地”表处于真理。何西阿书：<br />耶和华要放他们，如同放羊羔在宽阔之地。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何4.16.htm">4:16</a>）<br />“放在宽阔之地”表教导真理。<br />以赛亚书：<br />亚述必冲入犹大，淹没这地，直到颈项。它展开的翅膀必遮遍你宽阔的地土。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛8.8.htm">8:8</a>）<br />“亚述”表推理，它会“淹没这地”，或教会；“翅膀”表造成虚假的推理；“遮遍你宽阔的地土”表充满虚假，或充满违背真理之物。由于地的长度表良善，其宽度表真理，故经上说，新耶路撒冷是四方的，长宽一样（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.16.htm">21:16</a>）。由此可见，长和宽没有其它含义，因为新耶路撒冷无非是主在天上和地上的国。由于这些事物在内义上具有这样的含义，故在过去，用地上的事物来论及属天、属灵之物是司空见惯的事，如长和宽，就象如今人们在日常用语中论及智慧时用高、深一样。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1613.</strong> Along its length and along its breadth symbolizes the heavenly aspect and the spiritual aspect, or to put it another way, what is good and what is true. (For the symbolism of length as something good and of breadth as something true, see the remarks above at 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1613/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_650" target=_top>650</a>.){*1} The reason for this meaning is that land symbolizes the kingdom of heaven or the church, neither of which can be said to have length or breadth. They have only the equivalents of length and breadth, or in other words, something that corresponds to these 钬?namely, goodness and truth. The heavenly aspect or goodness is primary, so it is compared to length, but the spiritual aspect or truth is secondary, so it is compared to breadth.<br />[2] The fact that breadth is truth stands out fairly clearly in the prophetic portions of the Word. In Habakkuk, for instance:<br />I am raising up the Chaldeans, a nation bitter and swift, walking through the breadth of the land. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1613/bible_king-james-version_habakkuk_1_6" target=_top>Habakkuk 1:6</a>)<br />The Chaldeans stand for people whose thinking is distorted. Walking through the breadth of the land stands for destroying truth, since it is the Chaldeans who are said to do it. In David:<br />Jehovah, you did not shut me up in the hand of my enemy; you made my feet stand in a broad place. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1613/bible_king-james-version_psalms_31_8" target=_top>Psalms 31:8</a>)<br />Standing in a broad place means standing on the truth. In the same author:<br />In tight-bound anguish have I called on Jah;{*2} he answers me with broad liberality. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1613/bible_king-james-version_psalms_118_5" target=_top>Psalms 118:5</a>)<br />Answering with broad liberality stands for answering truly. In Hosea:<br />Jehovah will pasture them like a lamb, in a broad place. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1613/bible_king-james-version_hosea_4_16" target=_top>Hosea 4:16</a>)<br />Pasturing an animal in a broad place stands for teaching truth.<br />[3] In Isaiah:<br />Assyria will go through Judah, he will flood in and pass over, he will reach all the way to their neck, and the spread of his wings will be the fullness of the land's breadth. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1613/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_8_8" target=_top>Isaiah 8:8</a>)<br />Assyria stands for sophistry that will flood the land, or in other words, the church. His wings stand for arguments that lead to falsity. The full breadth stands for being full of falsity, or of ideas that oppose truth.<br />Since the length of the land symbolized goodness and its breadth symbolized truth, the New Jerusalem is described as having been measured and lying square, its length being as great as its width (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1613/bible_king-james-version_revelation_21_16" target=_top>Revelation 21:16</a>). From this anyone can see that the sole meaning of length and width is [goodness and truth], since the New Jerusalem is purely and simply the Lord's kingdom in the heavens and on earth.<br />Once upon a time the inner-level symbolism of things made it common for people to speak of heavenly and spiritual qualities in terms of phenomena found on earth, such as length and breadth. Height and depth likewise form a part of modern everyday language when the subject is wisdom.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} At 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1613/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_650" target=_top>650</a> Swedenborg equates length with holiness rather than with good. In that passage it is height instead that is connected with goodness. [LHC]<br />{*2} On the name Jah, see note 5 in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1613/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_16" target=_top>16</a>.

In the length of it and in the breadth of it. That this signifies the celestial and the spiritual, or what is the same, good and truth [may be seen from the signification of "length" and "breadth"]. 
That "length" signifies good, and "breadth" truth, may be seen explained before (n. 650). The reason is that "the land" signifies the heavenly kingdom, or the church, of which no length and breadth can 
be predicated, but only those things which are applicable and correspondent, which are goods and truths. The celestial, or good, being primary, is compared to length; and the spiritual or truth, being 
secondary, is compared to breadth.  [2] That "breadth" is truth, appears plainly enough in the prophetic Word. As in Habakkuk: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and swift nation, that walketh 
in the breadths of the land (Hab. 1:6); </p>
	<p>"the Chaldeans" denote those who are in falsity; "to walk in the breadths of the land," denotes to destroy truths, for this is predicated of the Chaldeans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;In David: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>O Jehovah, Thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy; Thou hast made my feet to stand in a broad place (Ps. 31:8); 
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"to stand in a broad place," denotes in truth. Again: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Out of straightness have I called upon Jah; Jah answered me in a broad place (Ps. 118:5);
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"to answer in a broad place," denotes in the truth. In Hosea: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Jehovah will feed them as a lamb, in 
a broad place (Hos. 4:16); </p>
</blockquote>
<p>"to feed in a broad place," signifies to teach truth.  </p>
<p>[3] In Isaiah: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Asshur shall go through Judah, he shall overflow and pass through, he shall reach even to the 
neck, and the stretchings out of his wings shall be the fullness of the breadth of thy land (Isa. 8:8);
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Asshur" denotes reasoning, which will overflow the land, or the church; "the wings" denote the 
reasonings whence falsities arise; "the fullness of the breadth," denotes that it is full of falsities, or things contrary to truth. Because the "length" of a land signifies good, and its "breadth" truth, 
the New Jerusalem is said to have been measured, and to lie foursquare, and its length to be as great as its breadth (Rev. 21:16), from which everyone can see that the length and the breadth signify 
nothing else, since the New Jerusalem is nothing else than the Lord's kingdom in the heavens and on earth. From the signification of things in the internal sense, modes of speaking concerning celestial 
and spiritual things by means of such things as are on earth, as by length and breadth, formerly became familiar; as the terms height and depth are used in common discourse at the present day, 
when predicated of wisdom. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1613</b></p><p><b>1613.</b>
'The length of it and the breadth of it' means the celestial dimension and the spiritual dimension, or what amounts to the same, good and truth. 'length' means good and 'breadth' truth; see what has 
been stated already in <a href="650.htm">650</a>. The reason is that 'land' means the heavenly kingdom, or Church, to which length and breadth are not attributable, only those things that match them and correspond to them, 
that is to say, goods and truths. The celestial dimension, or good, being primary, is compared to length, while the spiritual dimension, or truth, being secondary, is compared to breadth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That 
'breadth' is truth is quite clear from the Prophetical part of the Word, as in Habakkuk, </p>
<p>I am rousing the Chaldeans, a bitter and hasty nation, marching' into the breadths of the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hab%201:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hab 1:6</a>. </p>
<p>'Chaldeans' 
stands for people under the influence of falsity, 'marching<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> into the breadths of the earth' for the destruction of truths, for these words are used in reference to the Chaldeans. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
O 
Jehovah, You have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy You have made my feet stand in a broad place. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2031:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 31:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Standing in a broad place' stands for abiding in the truth. In the same 
author, </p>
<blockquote>
Out of my distress I called on lain; He answered me in a broad place. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20118:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 118:5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Answering in a broad place' stands for answering with the truth. In Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah will pasture them 
like a lamb in a broad place. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%204:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 4:16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Pasturing in a broad place' stands for teaching the truth.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Asshur will go through Judah, it will deluge it and pass through and will 
reach even to the neck; and the outstretching of its wings will fill the breadth of the land. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%208:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 8:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Asshur' stands for reasoning which would 'deluge the land', or the Church; 'wings' stands 
for reasonings from which falsities result; 'filling the breadth of the land' stands for its being full of falsities, or things contrary to the truth. Because the length of the land meant good and its 
breadth truth it is said that the New Jerusalem when measured lies four-square, its length being the same as its breadth, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2021:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 21:16</a>. From this anyone may see that length and breadth have no other meaning, 
since the New Jerusalem is nothing else than the Lord's kingdom in heaven and on earth. Because of the meaning things have in the internal sense it became commonplace in former times to refer 
to celestial and spiritual things by means of things on earth, such as length and breadth, just as height and depth are used nowadays in everyday speech when people are referring to wisdom.

'Secundum longitudinem ejus et secundum latitudinem ejus': quod significet caeleste et spirituale, vel quod idem, bonum et verum, quod 'longitudo' significet bonum, et 'latitudo' verum, dictum videatur 
prius n. 650; causa est quia 'terra' significat regnum caeleste seu Ecclesiam, de quibus nulla longitudo et latitudo praedicari potest, sed illa quae sunt adaequata et correspondentia, quae sunt bona 
et vera; caeleste seu bonum quia est primarium, comparatur 'longitudini,' spirituale autem seu verum quia est secundarium, comparatur 'latitudini'; [2] quod 'latitudo' sit verum, constat satis manifeste 
in Verbo prophetico, ut apud Habakkuk, 	Ego exsuscitans Chaldaeos, gentem amaram et celerem, ambulantem in latitudines terrae, i 6; </p>
<p>'Chaldaei' pro illis qui in falso, 'ambulare in latitudines 
terrae' pro destruere vera, nam praedicatur de Chaldaeis: apud Davidem, 	Jehovah non conclusisti me in manum inimici, stare fecisti in latitudine pedes meos, Ps. xxxi 9 [A.V. 8]; </p>
<p>'stare in latitudine' 
pro in vero: apud eundem, 	Ex angustia invocavi Jah, respondet mihi in latitudine, Ps. cxviii 5; </p>
<p>'respondere in latitudine' pro in veritate: apud Hosheam, 	Pascet eos Jehovah sicut agnum in latitudine, 
iv 16; </p>
<p>'pascere in latitudine' pro docere verum: [3] apud Esaiam, 	Asshur ibit per Jehudam, inundabit et transibit; usque ad collum pertinget, et erunt extensiones alarum ejus plenitudo latitudinis 
terrae, viii 8; </p>
<p>'Asshur' pro ratiocinatione, quae 'inundatura terram' seu Ecclesiam, 'alae' pro ratiociniis unde falsa, 'plenitudo latitudinis' pro quod plena falsis seu contrariis vero: quia 
'longitudo terrae' significabat bonum et 'latitudo' ejus verum, 	Nova Hierosolyma dicitur mensurata, et jacere quadrangularis et longitudo ejus tanta esse, quanta latitudo? Apoc. xxi 16; </p>
<p>ex quo quisque 
videre potest quod longitudo et latitudo non aliud significet, quoniam 'Nova Hierosolyma' non aliud est quam regnum Domini in caelis et terris.  Ex significatione rerum in sensu interno, locutiones 
de caelestibus et spiritualibus per talia quae in terris, ut per longitudines et latitudines, olim familiares factae sunt, sicut etiam altitudo et profunditas hodie in familiari sermone cum praedicati
