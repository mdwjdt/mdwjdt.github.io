<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6479节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6479.</strong>一些不怎么正直的灵人曾长时间地与我同在，他们不断注入基于感官幻觉的疑虑，这些疑虑反对这一观念：一切事物都能单从一个源头，因而从主流入。但我告诉他们说，如此多的疑虑不可能在短时间内消除，因为必须先驱散感官幻觉，还因为他们必须先知道无数未知事物。事实上，我告诉他们，对那些怀有否定心态，也就是否定态度普遍占主导的人来说，疑虑绝无可能消除。因为对这些人来说，一个小小的顾虑就像置于眼睛瞳孔前的一粒沙子；它虽只是一粒极小的沙子，却遮挡了一个人的整个视野。但那些怀有肯定心态，也就是肯定态度普遍占主导的人会弃绝这些基于感官幻觉并反对真理的顾虑，将他们不能理解的东西搁置一边，并说他们还不能明白这些东西，但他们依然坚持他们对真理的信仰。不过，上述灵人几乎不留心听这些话，因为他们怀有否定心态。</p>

Spirits not so well disposed, who were for some time with me, continually injected doubts from the fallacies of the senses against the possibility of all things flowing from one fountain, and thus from 
the Lord. But they were told that so many doubts cannot be removed within a short time, on account of the fallacies of the senses, which must first be dispelled, and on account of the numberless unknown 
things which must first be known; nay, that with those who are in what is negative, that is, those with whom what is negative universally reigns, doubts cannot possibly be removed; for with them 
one scruple has more weight than a thousand confirmations. For one scruple is like a grain of sand placed close before the pupil of the eye, which, although single and small, yet takes away all the sight. 
But they who are in what is affirmative, that is, those with whom what is affirmative universally reigns, reject the scruples from fallacies which are contrary to truths, and if there are any things 
which they do not apprehend, these they cast to the sides, and say that they do not as yet understand them, and nevertheless they remain in the belief of the truth. But the above-mentioned spirits 
attended little to these things, because they were in what is negative. </p>

Some not so upright spirits who were once with me for quite a time were constantly introducing doubts that were based on the illusions of the senses and went against the idea that all things can flow 
in from a single source, and so from the Lord. But I told them that so many doubts could not be removed in a short space of time, on account of the illusions of the senses which had to be dispelled first 
and on account of their lack of knowledge of countless things which they needed to know first. Indeed I told them that with people who have a negative frame of mind, that is, who are ruled through 
and through by a negative attitude, doubts cannot by any means be removed; for with these people one small difficulty has more validity than a thousand proofs. With them one small difficulty is like 
a grain of sand placed right in front of the pupil of the eye, and although it is only a single grain and very tiny it nevertheless blocks one's entire field of vision. But people who have an affirmative 
frame of mind, that is, who are ruled through and through by an affirmative attitude, turn away small difficulties which are based on the illusions of the senses and go against truths; and any things 
they cannot grasp they cast aside, saying that they do not yet understand them, and in so doing hold fast to their belief in the truth. But the spirits mentioned above paid little attention to what 
they were told because of their negative frame of mind. </p>

Spiritus non ita probi qui apud me {1}aliquamdiu erant, continue injecerunt dubia ex fallaciis sensuum contra id quod omnia influere possint ab {2}uno fonte, et sic a Domino; sed dictum est illis quod 
tot dubia non possent removeri intra breve tempus propter fallacias sensuum, quae prius discutiendae, et propter ignota quae innumera sunt et prius scienda; immo quod {3}apud illos qui in negativo 
sunt, hoc est, apud quos negativum universaliter regnat, dubia nequaquam removeri possint, nam apud illos unus scrupulus plus valet quam mille confirmantia; est enim unus scrupulus sicut arenae scrupulus 
prope ante pupillam oculi positus, qui tametsi unicus et exiguus, usque tamen omnem visum adimit; at vero qui in affirmativo sunt, hoc est, apud quos affirmativum universaliter regnat, rejiciunt scrupulos 
ex fallaciis qui sunt contra veritates {4}, et si aliqua sunt quae non capiunt, haec ad latera rejiciunt, et dicunt se nondum ea intelligere, et usque manent in fide veritatis.  Sed spiritus 
illi parum ad haec attendebant, quia in negativo erant.  @1 diu fuerunt$ @2 unico$ @3 ab illis$ @4 i nam hos confirmare volunt$ </p>
