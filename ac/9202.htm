<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9202节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9202.</strong>“他向我苦苦哀求”表祈求主的帮助。这是显而易见的，无需解释。在圣言中，“哀求”之所以用来表达强烈的恳求，是因为那些发自内心恳求之人的恳求，即便是无声的，在天堂也会被听见，如同一声呼喊或哀求。当人们仅仅在思考时，这种情况就会发生；当他们发出由衷的叹息时，情况更是如此。这一事实在代表性教会由一种呼喊，后来这种呼喊就成为犹太人当中的一种宗教的仪式。教导者也是类似情况。他们若发自内心教导人，就会在天堂被听见，就像人们大声呼喊一样。在天堂，在说话的，不仅是思维，更是对良善与真理的情感。我从经历得知，在那里说话的，是情感；它们若是热烈的，就会呼喊出来；对此，蒙主的神性怜悯，我将在别处予以论述。不过，对邪恶和虚假的情感在天堂根本听不见，即便一个人出于这些情感声嘶力竭地祈求和呼喊，同时紧握手掌，连同眼睛一起举向天空。这些情感在地狱里能听见，它们若是热烈的，在那里听上去也如同呼喊。</p>

So that crying he shall cry unto Me. That this signifies supplication to the Lord for aid, is evident without explication. Intense supplication is expressed in the Word by "a cry," because the supplication 
of those who supplicate from the heart, even if silent, is heard in heaven as a cry. Such is the case when men merely think, and still more when they groan, from a sincere heart. This was represented 
in the representative church by a cry; and hence the cry became a ceremonial observance among the Jews. The case is similar with those who teach; they are heard in heaven as crying aloud. In heaven, 
not only the thoughts, but especially the affections which are of good and truth, speak. That they speak, and if ardent cry out, has been given me to know from experience, concerning which, of the 
Lord's Divine mercy elsewhere. But affections of evil and falsity are not at all heard in heaven, even though the man who supplicates from them should cry out, and at the same time press his palms 
tightly together, and raise them together with his eyes to heaven. These latter affections are heard in hell, and if they are ardent, they are heard there also as cries. </p>

'And if he surely cries out to Me' means pleading to the Lord for help. This is clear without explanation. The reason why 'crying out' is used in the Word to express pleading intensely is that the pleas, 
even if they are silent, of those whose pleading springs from the heart are heard in heaven as a cry. This happens when people are only thinking, and more so when they breathe a heartfelt sigh. This 
reality was represented in the representative Church by a crying out, which then came to be a ritual observance among the Jews. The situation is similar with teachers. If they teach from the heart 
they are heard in heaven as people crying out. Not only thoughts speak in heaven, but more especially affections for what is good and true. I have been led to know from experience that affections speak 
there, and that if they are fervent they cry out; this however is something which in the Lord's Divine mercy will be dealt with elsewhere. But affections for what is evil and false are not heard at 
all in heaven, even though a person may be moved by them to plead and cry out at the top of his voice, while at the same time he presses the palms of his hands tightly together, and raises them together 
with his eyes towards heaven. Those affections are heard in hell, and also as cries if they are fervent.  </p>

`Quod si clamando clamaverit ad Me': quod significet supplicationem ad Dominum de ope, constat absque explicatione. Quod intensa supplicatio in Verbo exprimatur per `clamorem,' est quia supplicatio, 
etiamsi tacita, eorum qui ex corde supplicant, sicut clamor auditur in caelo; hoc fit cum homines modo cogitant, (c)et magis cum ingemiscunt ex sincero corde; hoc repraesentatum est per `clamorem' in 
Ecclesia repraesentativa; et inde id (t)factum est rituale apud Judaeos; similiter se habet cum illis qui docent; si ex corde docent, illi in caelo audiuntur sicut clamantes; non modo cogitationes, sed 
imprimis affectiones quae sunt boni et veri, loquuntur in caelo {1}; quod hae loquantur {2}, et si ardentes sunt {3}, quod clament,{4} ab experientia scire datum est, de qua, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, 
alibi.  Sed affectiones mali et falsi prorsus nihil audiuntur in caelo, etiamsi homo qui ex illis supplicat alte clamet, et (o)etiam simul tunc palmas valde comprimat, et (o)illas cum oculis 
elevet ad caelum; audiuntur illae in inferno, {5} et quoque (o)ibi ut clamores, si ardentes sunt. @1 ipsae voces non ibi audiuntur, sed solum affectiones quae sunt boni et veri$ @2 i in coelo$ @3 sint$ @4 
i ibi,$ @5 i quia inde sunt,$ </p>
