<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5156节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5156.</strong>“把你挂在木头上”表抛弃和定罪。这从“挂在木头上”的含义清楚可知，“挂在木头上”是指抛弃和定罪；因为把某人挂在木头上是一种诅咒，一种诅咒正从神性那里被抛弃，因而是定罪。把某人挂在木头上是一种诅咒，这一点明显可见于摩西五经：<br />人若犯该处死的罪，被治死了，你将他挂在木头上。他的尸首不可留在木头上过夜，必要当日将他葬埋。因为被挂的人是在神所咒诅的。你不可玷污耶和华你神所赐你为业之地。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申21.22.htm">21:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申21.23.htm">23</a>）<br />“不可留他在木头上过夜”表示永远抛弃；因为到了晚上，新的一天就开始了；因此，如果被挂的人到了晚上还没有被抛弃，就代表邪恶没有被抛弃，因而那地没有摆脱邪恶，反而被玷污了；故经上补充说：“你不可玷污耶和华你神所赐你为业之地”。被挂的人挂到晚上，不能过长（参看约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书8.29.htm">8:29</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/书10.26.htm">10:26</a>）。在犹太民族当中有两种主要的惩罚方式，即用石头砸死和挂起来。用石头砸死是由于虚假，挂在木头上是由于邪恶；因为“石头”表示真理（参看<a href="643.htm">643</a>，<a href="1298.htm">1298</a>，<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>节），在反面意义上表示虚假；而“木头”表示良善（<a href="2784.htm">2784</a>，<a href="2812.htm">2812</a>，<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>节），在反面意义上表示邪恶。因此，在圣言的预言部分，经上常常提到“与石头、木头行淫”，以此表示对真理的歪曲（这是虚假），以及对良善的玷污（这是邪恶）。</p>

And shall hang thee upon wood. That this signifies rejection and damnation, is evident from the signification of "being hanged upon wood," as being rejection and damnation; for hanging upon wood was 
a curse, and a curse is a rejection from the Divine, consequently damnation. That hanging upon wood was a curse, is evident in Moses: </p>
<p>	When there shall be in a man a crime of judgment of death, and he 
be put to death, so that thou hangest him upon wood, his carcass shall not remain all night upon the wood, but burying thou shalt bury him the same day, for he that is hanged is the curse of God; that 
thou defile not the land which Jehovah thy God will give thee for an inheritance (Deut. 21:22-23); </p>
<p>that he "should not remain all night upon the wood" signified perpetual rejection; for in the evening 
the day began anew, and therefore unless they who had been hanged were cast away before evening, it would have represented that evil was not rejected, and consequently that the land was not freed 
from it, but was defiled; and therefore it is added, "that thou defile not the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance." That the hanged remained until evening and no longer may be 
seen in Joshua 8:29; 10:26. Among the Jewish nation there were two main penalties-stoning and hanging. Stoning was on account of falsity, and hanging upon wood was on account of evil; and this because 
"stone" is truth (see n. 643, 1298, 3720), and in the opposite sense falsity; and "wood" is good (n. 2784, 2812, 3720), and in the opposite sense evil; and therefore in the prophetic Word mention is 
occasionally made of "committing adultery with stone and wood," whereby is signified the perversion of truth, which is falsity, and the adulteration of good, which is evil. </p>

'And will hang you on wood' means a casting aside and condemnation. This is clear from the meaning of 'being hanged on wood' as a casting aside and condemnation; for hanging someone on wood was a curse, 
and a curse is being cast aside from the Divine and consequently is condemnation. The fact that hanging someone on wood was a curse is clear in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
If a man has committed a crime punishable 
by death and he has been slain, so that you hang him on wood, his dead body shall not remain all night on the wood, but you must bury him the same day, for the one hanged is the curse of God. For you 
shall not defile the land which Jehovah your God is giving you for an inheritance. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2021:22,%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 21:22, 23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'It shall not remain all night on the wood' meant casting aside for ever. For in the evening a new 
day began; therefore if those who had been hanged were not cast away before the evening, the failure to cast evil aside and consequently the failure to rid the land of that evil were represented. The 
land was defiled; hence the addition of the words 'You shall not defile the land which Jehovah your God is giving you for an inheritance'. They were left hanging until evening, but no later, see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%208:29;%2010:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 8:29; 10:16</a>. Among the Jewish nation two chief forms of punishment existed, stoning and hanging. The existence of stoning was due to falsity, that of hanging on wood to evil, for the reason that 'stone' 
means truth, <a href="643.htm">643</a>, <a href="1298.htm">1298</a>, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>, and in the contrary sense falsity, while 'wood' means good, <a href="2784.htm">2784</a>, <a href="2812.htm">2812</a>, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>, and in the contrary sense evil. This is why frequent reference is made in the prophetical 
part of the Word to 'committing adultery with stone and wood', meaning the perversion of truth, which is falsity, and the adulteration of good, which is evil. </p>

</p><b>5156.</b>
`Et suspendet te super ligno': quod significet rejectionem et damnationem, constat ex significatione `suspendi super ligno' quod sit rejectio et damnatio; suspensio enim super ligno fuit maledictio, 
et maledictio est rejectio a Divino, consequenter damnatio; quod suspensio super ligno fuerit maledictio, constat apud Mosen, </p>
<p>          Cum fuerit in viro crimen judicii mortis, et occisus  
    fuerit, ita ut suspendas eum super ligno, non pernoctabit      cadaver ejus super ligno, sed sepeliendo sepelies eum in      die eodem, nam maledictio Dei suspensus: quia {1} non      pollues terram, 
quam Jehovah Deus tuus daturus tibi      hereditatem. Deut. xxi 22, 23; </p>
<p> quod `non pernoctaret super ligno' significabat perpetuam rejectionem; in vespera enim incohabat e novo dies, quapropter 
nisi ante vesperam rejecti fuissent qui suspensi, repraesentabatur quod malum non rejectum esset, consequenter quod terra non liberata ab illo sed quod polluta, quapropter additur `non pollues 
terram quam Jehovah Deus tuus daturus tibi hereditatem'; quod suspensi fuerint ad vesperam et non ultra, videatur Jos. viii 29; x 26.  Apud gentem Judaicam binae poenae principales fuerunt, {2} lapidatio 
et suspensio; lapidatio fuit propter falsum, et suspensio super ligno propter malum, et hoc quia `lapis' est verum, n. 643, 1298, 3720, et in sensu opposito falsum, (c)ac `lignum' est bonum, 
n. 2784, 2812, 3720, et in opposito sensu malum; quare in Verbo prophetico aliquoties dicitur `moechari cum lapide et ligno', et per id significatur perversio veri seu falsum, et adulteratio boni, 
seu malum. </p>
