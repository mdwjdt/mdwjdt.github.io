<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10242节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10242</strong>.“他们进会幕”表源于信之良善的敬拜。这从“进会幕”的含义清楚可知，当论及亚伦和他的儿子时，“进会幕”代表源于信之良善敬拜的一切事物。“进会幕”之所以代表这些事物，是因为“走近祭坛”代表源于爱之良善的敬拜的一切事物。神性敬拜由两个要素构成，即：信之良善和爱之良善。神性敬拜必须由要么由第一种良善，要么由第二种良善构成。信之良善就是对邻之仁的良善，爱之良善则是对主之爱的良善。这两种良善就像属灵之物和属天之物那样彼此不同；至于它们之间的这种不同是何性质，可参看9277节提到的地方。源于属灵良善，即信之良善，也就是源于对邻之仁的良善的敬拜由亚伦和他的儿子在会幕中的供职来代表，在会幕中每天都要供职，因为这个帐幕代表属灵良善掌权的天堂。而源于属天良善，即对主之爱的良善的敬拜由亚伦和他的儿子在祭坛旁的供职来代表（<a href="9963.htm">9963</a>，<a href="9964.htm">9964</a>，<a href="10001.htm">10001</a>，<a href="10025.htm">10025</a>节）。</p>

When they enter into the Tent of meeting. That this signifies worship from the good of faith, is evident from the signification of "entering into the Tent of meeting," when said of Aaron and his sons, 
as being to represent all things of worship from the good of faith. That these things were represented by "entering into the Tent of meeting," was because by "coming near to the altar" were represented 
all things of worship from the good of love. There are two essentials of Divine worship: the good of faith, and the good of love. Worship is Divine, whether it be from the former good, or from the 
latter. The good of faith is the good of charity toward the neighbor; and the good of love is the good of love to the Lord. These goods differ from each other as do the spiritual and the celestial, for 
the nature of which difference see the places cited in n. 9277. Worship from the good of faith, or from the good of charity toward the neighbor, was represented by the ministration of Aaron and his 
sons in the Tent of meeting (in which there was daily ministration), because by that Tent was represented the heaven where spiritual good reigns; but worship from celestial good, which is the good of 
love to the Lord, was represented by the ministration of Aaron and his sons at the altar (n. 9963, 9964, 10001, 10025). </p>

'When they go into the tent of meeting' means worship springing from the good of faith. This is clear from the meaning of 'going into the tent of meeting', when said in reference to Aaron and his sons, 
as representing all things of worship springing from the good of faith. The reason why these things were represented by going into the tent of meeting is that all things of worship springing from the 
good of love were represented by approaching the altar. There are two essential constituents of Divine worship, the good of faith and the good of love; Divine worship must consist of the first kind 
of good or else of the second. The good of faith is the good of charity towards the neighbour, and the good of love is the good of love to the Lord. These two kinds of good differ from each other as 
what is spiritual and what is celestial do; for the nature of the difference between them, see in the places referred to in <a href="9277.htm">9277</a>. Worship springing from spiritual good, which is the good of faith, that 
is, from the good of charity towards the neighbour, was represented by the services performed by Aaron and his sons in the tent of meeting, in which those services were performed every day; for that 
tent represented the heaven where spiritual good reigns. But worship springing from celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord, was represented by the services performed by Aaron and his sons 
at the altar, see <a href="9963.htm">9963</a>, <a href="9964.htm">9964</a>, <a href="10001.htm">10001</a>, <a href="10025.htm">10025</a>.  </p>

`In intrando illos in tentorium conventus': quod significet cultum ex bono fidei, constat ex significatione `intrare in tentorium conventus' cum de Aharone et filiis ejus, quod sit repraesentare omnia 
cultus ex bono fidei; quod haec repraesentata fuerint per intrare in tentorium conventus, est quia per accedere ad altare {1}repraesentata fuerunt omnia cultus ex bono amoris; sunt duo essentialia 
cultus Divini, bonum fidei et bonum amoris; cultus Divinus sive erit ex illo bono sive ex hoc; bonum fidei est bonum charitatis erga proximum, et bonum amoris est bonum amoris in Dominum; differunt haec 
bona inter se, sicut {2}spirituale et caeleste, quorum differentia qualis sit, videatur in locis citatis n. 9277; cultus ex bono spirituali, quod est bonum fidei seu ex bono charitatis erga proximum,
