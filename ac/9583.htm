<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9583节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9583.</strong>事实的确如此，这一点也得到证实。因为当陪同我们来到这个大鸿沟的一些灵人未经允许就越过它时，他们开始大声呼喊，说他们快要灭亡，就像垂死挣扎的人；于是，他们停在鸿沟的那一侧，不能再往前走了。因为从鸿沟冒上来的火红烟雾充满它们，使他们感到窒息。火红烟雾是由欲望的邪恶所产生的虚假。这就是那虚假看上去的样子。</p>

That this was so was also confirmed, for when certain spirits who were in the company came to that great interspace, and who had not received permission to pass over it, they began to cry out vehemently 
that they were perishing, for they were like persons struggling in the agony of death; and therefore they stayed on that side of the abyss, and could not be conveyed any further; for the fiery smoke 
which exhaled from the abyss filled them, and thus tormented them. The fiery smoke is falsity from the evils of concupiscences. So does this falsity appear. </p>

This was also proved to be so. When some spirits in our company who had not received permission to go across came to that great gap they began to cry out vehemently that they were perishing, for they 
were like those in agony, fighting for their lives; they therefore stopped on that side of the gulf and could not be taken any further on. For the fiery smoke issuing out of the gulf took hold of them 
and so choked them. The fiery smoke is falsity arising from the evils of cravings. This is what that falsity is seen as.  </p>

</p><b>9583.</b>
Quod ita esset, etiam confirmabatur; quidam enim spiritus qui in comitatu erant, quibus non permissum fuit transire, cum ad magnum illud interstitium venerunt, coeperunt clamare valde quod pereant, 
erant enim sicut illi qui in agone cum morte luctantur; quare ab illa parte voraginis illius subsistebant, nec ulterius transferri potuerunt; igneus enim fumus exhalatus ex voragine occupabat illos, ac 
ita cruciabat. Fumus igneus est falsum ex malis concupiscentiarum; ita id falsum apparet. </p>
