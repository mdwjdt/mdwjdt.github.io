<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5977节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5977.</strong>之所以有两个，是因为地狱灵有两种，天堂天使也有两种，他们对应于人里面的两种官能，即意愿和理解力。第一种灵人被称为简单灵人，他们作用于人的理解力中的思维；第二种被称为魔鬼，他们作用于人的意愿中的渴望。这两种彼此完全不同。被称为简单灵人的，灌输虚假，因为他们为反对真理而进行推理，当他们能使真理看似虚假，使虚假看似真理时，便体验到生活的乐趣。但被称为魔鬼的，灌输邪恶；他们作用于人的情感和欲望，并且瞬间就能闻出此人渴望什么。如果这渴望是良善，他们就极其巧妙、狡猾地将它弯曲成邪恶；当能使一个人视良善为邪恶，视邪恶为良善时，他们便体验到生活的乐趣。他们被允许作用于我自己的渴望，好叫我了解他们是何性质，如何运作；我必须坦承，若非主通过天使保护我，这些魔鬼就会将我的渴望转变为对邪恶的贪恋，并且他们做起这种事来如此隐秘、悄无声息，以致我对此几乎一无所知。被称为魔鬼的，和被称为灵人的，毫无共同之处。魔鬼根本不关心人想什么，只关心他爱什么；而灵人根本不关心人爱什么，只关心他想什么。魔鬼喜欢保持安静，而灵人喜欢交谈。这两种也彼此完全分开。魔鬼在后面深处的地狱，在那里不为灵人所见；当有人俯视那里时，他们看上去就像四处飞舞的影子。但灵人在周边和前面的地狱。这就是为什么有两个地狱灵与人同在的原因。</p>

That there are two, is because there are two kinds of spirits in hell and two kinds of angels in heaven, to which the two faculties in man, namely, the will and the understanding, correspond. Spirits 
of the one kind are called simply spirits and act into what is of the understanding. Those of the other kind are called genii and act into what is of the will. The two kinds are also most distinct from 
each other. They who are called simply spirits infuse falsities, for they reason against truth and are in the delight of their life when they can make what is true appear as false, and what is false 
appear as true. But they who are called genii infuse evils, act into the affections and concupiscences of a man, and scent in a moment what the man desires. If this is good, they bend it most cunningly 
into evil, and are in the delight of their life when they can make good to be perceived as evil, and evil as good. It was permitted them to act into my desires, that I might know of what nature they 
are and how they act, and I can avouch that unless the Lord had guarded me by angels they would have perverted my desires into concupiscences of evil, and this in a manner so hidden and silent that 
I should scarcely have noticed anything about it. These latter, who are called genii, have nothing at all in common with those who are called spirits. The genii have no concern as to what a man thinks, 
but only as to what he loves; whereas the spirits have no concern about what a man loves, but about what he thinks. The genii vest their delight in being silent, but the spirits in speaking. The two 
are also altogether separated from each other. The genii are in the hells deep down behind, and are invisible there to the spirits; and when anyone looks in there, they appear like flitting shadows. 
But the spirits are in the hells at the sides and in front. This then is the reason why there are with man two spirits from hell. </p>

The reason for two is that there are two kinds of spirits in hell and two kinds of angels in heaven, who correspond to the two mental powers in a person of will and understanding The first kind of spirits 
are called simply spirits, and they act on the thoughts in a person's understanding; the second kind are called genii, and these act on the desires in a person's will. The two kinds are utterly 
distinct and separate. Those called simply spirits instill falsities, for they argue against the truth and experience the delight of their life when they can make truth look like falsity, and falsity 
look like truth. But those called genii instill evils; they act on a person's affections and cravings, scenting in an instant what is the object of the person's desire. If the desire is good they bend 
it with very great skill into what is evil, and they experience the delight of their life when they can make a person perceive good as evil, and evil as good. They have been allowed to act on my own 
desires so that I might know what such genii are like and how they operate; and I must confess that unless the Lord had employed angels to protect me, those genii would have turned my desires into cravings 
for evil, which they would have carried out so secretly and silently that I would have known scarcely anything about it. The ones who are called genii have nothing whatever in common with those 
called spirits. Genii have no interest at all in what a person thinks, only in what he loves, whereas spirits have no interest at all in what a person loves, only in what he thinks. Genii take delight 
in keeping quiet, but spirits in talking. The two kinds are also completely separate from each other. The genii are in hells deep down behind the back, out of spirits' sight; and when anyone looks down 
there they look like shadows flitting around. But the spirits are in hells located to the sides and in front. Here then is the reason why two spirits from hell are present with a person. </p>

Quod duo sint, est causa quia duo genera spirituum in inferno sunt, et duo genera angelorum in caelo, quibus correspondent duae facultates in homine, nempe voluntas et intellectus; primum genus spirituum 
simpliciter vocantur `spiritus' et agunt in intellectualia; alterum genus vocantur `genii' et agunt in voluntaria; sunt etiam inter se distinctissimi; nam illi qui simpliciter vocantur spiritus, 
infundunt falsa; ratiocinantur enim contra verum, (c)ac in suae vitae jucundo sunt cum possunt facere ut verum appareat {1}ut falsum ac falsum {1}ut verum; at illi qui vocantur genii, infundunt mala, 
agunt in affectiones et concupiscentias hominis, et {2} olfaciunt momento quid desiderat homo; si hoc bonum est, solertissime flectunt id in malum; in jucundo suae vitae sunt cum possunt facere ut bonum 
appercipiatur ut malum ac malum ut bonum; {3}illis permissum fuit agere in mea desideria ut scirem qualis naturae sunt, et quomodo agunt, et fateri {4}possum, nisi Dominus per angelos custodiverit, 
quod pervertissent illa in concupiscentias {5}mali, et hoc tam latenter ac tacite ut vix aliquid de eo apperciperem. [2] Hi qui genii vocantur nec quicquam commune habent cum illis qui vocantur spiritus; 
illi seu genii nihil curant quid homo cogitat sed solum quid amat; hi autem seu spiritus nihil curant quid homo amat sed quid cogitat; illi seu genii jucundum in tacendo ponunt, hi autem seu spiritus 
in loquendo; sunt quoque {6}prorsus separati ab invicem; genii sunt in infernis a tergo profunde, et ibi inconspicui {7}spiritibus, cumque inspicitur illuc, apparent sicut umbrae quae {8}volutant; 
spiritus autem in infernis a lateribus et {9}ab anterioribus sunt; inde nunc est quod apud hominem bini {10}spiritus ab inferno sint. @1 sicut$ @2 i quasi$ @3 i quandoque$ @4 possim$ @5 tam dextre 
ut minime$ @6 nusquam simul$ @7 ,cum$ @8 volitarent$ @9 antrorsum, et conspicui sunt, et apparent in sua luce sicut homines, et in luce caeli sicut monstra$ @10 sint ab inferno$ </p>
