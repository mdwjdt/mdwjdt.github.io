<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2784节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2784.</strong>“也劈好了燔祭的柴”表公义的功德。这从“柴”（即木头）和“劈柴”的含义清楚可知。“柴”（即木头）表系人为和公义产物的良善；“劈柴”表将功德置于系人为产物的良善中。至于“劈燔祭的柴”表公义的功德，若没有启示，这似乎相差甚远，以至于没人知道。“劈柴”表将功德置于系人为产物的良善中，这一事实已通过我亲眼所见并描述的景象（参看第一卷<a href="1110.htm">1110</a>节）清楚向我显明；也就是说，砍柴者是那些渴望凭自己所行之善得到救赎的人。此外，还有其他人，他们在前面、上方，以及稍向右一点，来自某个其它星球。这些人同样视一切良善为自己的，并且同样表现为砍柴和劈柴。有时，当这些人看似辛苦劳作时，他们的脸因着某种昏昧之火的光照而发光，这种昏昧之火就是他们归为己有的功德之善。有这种表现的原因在于，“柴”（即木头）是良善的代表物。在方舟和圣殿中，以及献燔祭或献祭时堆在祭坛上的所有柴（即木头）都是如此。在圣言中，经上也说将善归为己有，使其变成功德的人拜的是木头或木制雕像。</p>

And he clave the wood for the burnt-offering. That this signifies the merit of righteousness, is evident from the signification of "wood" and of "cleaving wood." That "wood" signifies the goods that 
are of works, and of righteousness; and that "cleaving wood" signifies the placing of merit in the goods that are of works, but "cleaving wood for a burnt-offering" the merit of righteousness, appears 
too remote to be known without revelation. That "cleaving wood" denotes placing merit in the goods that are of works, was made clear to me by what I have seen and have described in volume 1 (n. 1110) 
respecting the hewers of wood, as being those who had desired to merit salvation by the goods which they had done. Moreover there are others also, in front, above, a little to the right, from a certain 
world, who in the same way had claimed all good to themselves, and appear in like manner to cut and cleave wood. When these seem to themselves to be laboring, they sometimes shine in the face from 
a kind of fatuous fire, which is the good of merit that they attribute to themselves. The reason of its appearing so is that wood is a representative of good; as was all the wood in the ark and in the 
temple, and also all the wood upon the altar when the burnt-offerings and sacrifices were made. But they who attribute good to themselves, and make it self-meritorious, these also are said in the Word 
to "worship wood," or a "graven image" of wood. </p>

'And split the pieces of wood for the burnt offering' means the merit of righteousness. This is clear from the meaning of 'the pieces of wood' and of 'splitting them' 'Pieces of wood' means goods which 
are the product of one's own works, and those which are the product of righteousness; and 'splitting pieces of wood' means placing merit in the goods which are the product of one's own works. But as 
regards 'splitting the wood for the burnt offering' meaning the merit of righteousness, this seems too remote for anyone to know without revelation. The fact that 'splitting pieces of wood' means placing 
merit in the goods which are the product of one's own works has been made clear to me from the incidents I have witnessed and described in Volume One, in <a href="1110.htm">1110</a>, about hewers of wood being those who, 
through the goods which they have done, wish to merit salvation. In addition there are others up above, in front and slightly to the right, who come from some other planet. These in the same way have 
claimed for themselves all good and are seen in like manner to be hewing and splitting wood. Sometimes, when they seem to themselves to be hard at work, their faces shine from the light shed by some 
ignis fatuus, which is the meritorious good that they attribute to themselves. The reason for such an appearance is that 'wood' is representative of good, as was all the wood in the Ark and in the 
Temple, and also all the wood placed on the altar when burnt offerings and sacrifices were made. But people who attribute good to themselves and make it meritorious are also said in the Word to worship 
wood or a graven image made of wood. </p>

</p><b>2784.</b>
`Et fidit ligna holocausti': quod significet meritum justitiae, constat a significatione `lignorum' et `findere ligna'; quod `ligna' significent bona quae operum, et quae justitiae, et `findere ligna' 
quod significet meritum ponere in bonis quae operum, at `findere ligna holocausti' meritum justitiae, apparet remotius quam ut sciri queat absque revelatione: quod `findere ligna' sit meritum ponere 
in bonis quae operum, constare mihi potuit ex illis quae visa sunt et descripta in Parte Prima n. 1110 de sectoribus lignorum, quod sint illi qui, per bona quae fecerunt, mereri voluerunt salutem; praeterea 
etiam sunt alii antrorsum superne paulo ad dextrum, ex quodam orbe, qui pariter omne bonum sibi vindicarunt, et apparent similiter secare {1}et findere ligua; hi quandoque cum laborare sibi videntur, 
lucent facie ex igne quodam fatuo, quod est bonum meriti quod sibi tribuunt; causa quod ita appareat, est quia `lignum' est repraesentativum boni, ut fuit omne lignum quod in arca, et in templo, 
tum quoque omne lignum super altari cum holocausta et sacrificia fiebant; qui autem bonum sibi tribuunt et {1} meritorium faciunt, ii etiam in Verbo dicuntur `adorare lignum aut sculptile ex ligno.' 
{2}  @1 aut$ @2 A has the following references and comments but they are deleted: ut apud Habakuk `Vae dicenti ligno, expergiscere, et suscitare lapidi silenti, hic docebit, hic ecce fixus auro at 
argento, et nullus spiritus in medio ejus; at Jehovah in Templo Sanctitatis Suae' ii 19: apud Jeremiam `Dicentes Ligno, pater meus tu, et lapidi, tu genuisti nos' ii 27: apud Hoscheam `Populus Lignum 
suum interrogat, et baculus ejus indicat ei, quia spiritus scortationum seduxit' iv 12; lignum ibi pro bono meriti, quod ex cupiditate amoris sui. At secare aut findere ligna holocausti, significat 
meritum justitiae, quod Soli Domino; quod ut repraesentaretur, ligna quae super altari findebantur, ideo sectores lignorum erant, de quibus apud Joschuam cap. ix 21, 23, 27; videatur etiam I Sam. vi 14.$ </p>
