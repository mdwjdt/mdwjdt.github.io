<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1736节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1736.</strong>主就是耶和华，祂在此被称为“至高神”。这从圣言清楚看出来，如以赛亚书：<br />因为造你的是你的丈夫，万军之耶和华是祂的名；你的救主是以色列的圣者，祂必称为全地之神。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛54.5.htm">54:5</a>）<br />这里明显指出“救主和以色列的圣者”，祂唯独是主，是“万军之耶和华”和“全地之神”。同一先知书：<br />耶和华你的救赎主，以色列的圣者如此说，我是耶和华你的神。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛48.17.htm">48:17</a>）<br /><br />耶和华说，我必帮助你。你的救赎主就是以色列的圣者。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛41.14.htm">41:14</a>）<br />“以色列的圣者”和“以色列的神”这样的表述经常出现。主就是以色列的圣者和以色列的神。这从经上说“他们看见以色列的神，祂脚下仿佛有平铺的蓝宝石，如同天色明净”（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出24.10.htm">24:10</a>）非常清楚看出来。<br />犹太教会并不承认和称呼别的为耶和华，因为犹太教会敬拜耶和华一位神，更重要的原因是，犹太教会的一切宗教仪式都代表祂（尽管他们绝大多数都不知道这一点），并且，就内义而言，圣言的一切事物都具有祂的含义。以赛亚书：<br />他已经吞灭死亡直到永远。主耶和华必擦去各人脸上的眼泪。到那日，人必说，看哪，这是我们的神，我们素来等候他，祂必拯救我们。这是耶和华，我们素来等候祂，我们必因祂的救恩欢喜快乐。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛25.8.htm">25:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛25.9.htm">9</a>）<br />这论及主的到来。<br /><br />看哪，主耶和华必像大能者临到，祂的膀臂必为祂掌权。祂必像牧人牧养自己的羊群，用膀臂聚集羊羔抱在怀中，慢慢引导那乳养小羊的。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.10.htm">40:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.11.htm">11</a>）<br />这明确论及主，祂是“主耶和华”。“祂必像大能者临到，祂的膀臂必为祂掌权”表这一事实：即祂会凭自己的力量战胜地狱。“牧养羊群”、“用膀臂聚集”、“将羊羔抱在怀中”、“慢慢引导那乳养小羊的”都论及祂的爱或怜悯。<br /><br />耶和华，就是创造诸天，形成大地而造它的神自己，祂自己坚固它，并非创造它为荒凉，祂形成大地，是要给人居住。祂如此说，我是耶和华，再没有别神！不是我耶和华吗？除了我以外，再没有神！我是公义的神，又是救主，除了我以外，再没有别神！地极的人都当仰望我，就必得救。因为我是神，再没有别神！（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.18.htm">45:18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.21.htm">21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.22.htm">22</a>）<br />此处经上明显指出，唯独主是耶和华和神。“创造诸天，形成大地”就是重生，因此“天地的创造者”是再造者（参看<a href="16.htm">16</a>，<a href="88.htm">88</a>，<a href="472.htm">472</a>节等）。这就是为何主在各处被称为创造者，形成者和作成者。<br /><br />亚伯拉罕虽然不认识我们，以色列也不承认我们，你却是我们的父。耶和华啊，你是我们的父；从万古以来，你名称为我们的救赎主。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.16.htm">63:16</a>）<br />这明确论及主，唯独祂是救赎主。摩西书：<br />你们要在祂面前谨慎，听从祂的话，不可惹祂，因为祂必不赦免你们的过犯，因为我的名在祂之中。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出23.21.htm">23:21</a>）<br />“名”表示本质（参看<a href="144.htm">144</a>，<a href="145.htm">145</a>节），而“在祂之中”是指至内层（<a href="1074.htm">1074</a>节）。<br />以赛亚书：<br />因有一婴孩为我们而生，有一子赐给我们，政权必担在祂的肩头上。祂名称为奇妙、策士、神、勇士、永恒的父、和平的君！（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.6.htm">9:6</a>）<br />这明显论及主。耶利米书：<br />看哪，日子将到，我要给大卫兴起一个公义的苗裔；祂必掌王权，行事有智慧，在地上施行公平和公义。在他的日子，犹大必得救，以色列也安然居住。他的名必称为“耶和华我们的义”。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.5.htm">23:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.6.htm">6</a>）<br />这也明显论及主。撒迦利亚书：<br />耶和华必作全地的王，那日耶和华必为独一无二的，祂的名也是独一无二的。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚14.9.htm">14:9</a>）<br />这同样明显论及主。“名”表本质。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1736.</strong> The Word makes it quite clear that the Lord is Jehovah, who is called God the Highest here. In Isaiah:<br />Jehovah Sabaoth is his name; and your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, is called God of the whole earth. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1736/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_54_5" target=_top>Isaiah 54:5</a>)<br />This states explicitly that the Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel — who is the Lord alone — is Jehovah Sabaoth and God of the whole earth. In the same author:<br />This is what Jehovah your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, has said: "I am Jehovah your God." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1736/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_48_17" target=_top>Isaiah 48:17</a>)<br />In the same author:<br />"I myself am helping you," says Jehovah, "your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1736/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_41_14" target=_top>Isaiah 41:14</a>)<br />The names "Holy One of Israel" and "God of Israel" are used many times. It is obvious that they refer to the Lord.<br />They saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was a seeming work of sapphire stone, and it seemed like the substance of the sky for purity. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1736/bible_king-james-version_exodus_24_10" target=_top>Exodus 24:10</a>)<br />[2] The Jewish religion also did not acknowledge or name anyone else [than the Lord to come] as Jehovah, because it worshiped Jehovah as the one God. That religion focused all the more on the Lord because all its rites represented him and the whole of the Word symbolized him on an inner level, although most of the people were unaware of this. In Isaiah:<br />He will swallow death up evermore, and the Lord Jehovih will wipe away the tear from all faces. And they will say on that day, "Look! This is our God! We have awaited him, and he will save us. This is Jehovah, whom we have awaited; we will rejoice and be glad in his salvation." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1736/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_25_8-9" target=_top>Isaiah 25:8-9</a>)<br />This is about the Lord's Coming.<br />[3] In the same author:<br />Watch! The Lord Jehovih will come in might, and his arm is ruling for him. He will pasture his flock like a shepherd; he will gather them into his arm; he will carry little lambs on his chest; he will lead the unweaned. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1736/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_40_10-11" target=_top>Isaiah 40:10-11</a>)<br />This is plainly about the Lord, who is being called the Lord Jehovih. "He will come in might, and his arm is ruling for him" stands for the fact that he would conquer the hells by his own power. Pasturing his flock, gathering it into his arm, carrying little lambs on his breast, and leading the unweaned refers to his love, or mercy.<br />[4] In the same author:<br />This is what Jehovah has said; he is God, creating the heavens, forming the earth and making it; he is firming it; he has not created it an emptiness, he has formed it to be inhabited: "I am Jehovah, and there is no other. Is it not so, that I am Jehovah and except for me there is no other God? I am a just God, and there is no Savior except me. Turn to face me and be saved, all you ends of the earth! For I am God, and there is no other." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1736/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_45_18" target=_top>Isaiah 45:18</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1736/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_45_21-22" target=_top>21-22</a>)<br />This clearly says that the Lord is the one Jehovah and God. Creating the heavens and forming the earth is regenerating us, so the creator of heaven and earth is the Regenerator; see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1736/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_16" target=_top>16</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1736/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_88" target=_top>88</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1736/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_472" target=_top>472</a>, and other places. As a result, the Lord in many places is called the Creator, Fashioner, and Maker.{*1} [5] In the same author:<br />You are our Father, because Abraham does not know us and Israel does not acknowledge us. You are Jehovah, our Father, our Redeemer; your name is age-old. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1736/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_63_16" target=_top>Isaiah 63:16</a>)<br />This is obviously about the Lord, who is the only Redeemer. In Moses:<br />Be careful before him and listen to his voice, so as not to vex him, because he will not put up with your transgressing, since my name is in the middle of him. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1736/bible_king-james-version_exodus_23_21" target=_top>Exodus 23:21</a>)<br />The name of something is its essential character (see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1736/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_144" target=_top>144</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1736/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_145" target=_top>145</a>), and what is "in the middle" is the deepest core (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1736/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1074" target=_top>1074</a>).<br />[6] In Isaiah:<br />A child has been born for us, a son has been given to us, and sovereignty will be on his shoulder; his name will be called Miraculous, Counselor, God, Hero, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1736/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_9_6-7" target=_top>Isaiah 9:6-7</a>)<br />Clearly this is the Lord. In Jeremiah:<br />Look! The days are coming when I will raise up for David a just offshoot, and he will reign as monarch, and he will act with understanding and exercise judgment and justice in the land. In his days Judah will be saved and Israel will live securely. And this is his name that they will call him: Jehovah our justice. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1736/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_23_5-6" target=_top>Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>)<br />Clearly this is the Lord. In Zechariah:<br />Jehovah will become monarch over the whole earth. On that day Jehovah will be one, and his name one. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1736/bible_king-james-version_zechariah_14_9" target=_top>Zechariah 14:9</a>)<br />Clearly this is about the Lord. His name stands for his essential nature.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For examples of passages in which God is called by the titles mentioned here, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1736/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_17_7" target=_top>Isaiah 17:7</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1736/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_22_11" target=_top>22:11</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1736/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_43_1" target=_top>43:1</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1736/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_44_2" target=_top>44:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1736/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_44_24" target=_top>24</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1736/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_45_9" target=_top>45:9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1736/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_45_11" target=_top>11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1736/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_45_18" target=_top>18</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1736/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_49_5" target=_top>49:5</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1736/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_54_5" target=_top>54:5</a>.

That the Lord is Jehovah, who is here called "God Most High," is plainly evident from the Word. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah Zebaoth is His name, and thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; the God of the 
whole earth is He called (Isa. 54:5); </p>
<p>where it is plain that the Redeemer and the Holy One of Israel, who is the Lord alone, is "Jehovah Zebaoth" and "the God of the whole earth." Again: </p>
<p>     Thus said 
Jehovah thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, I am Jehovah thy God (Isa. 48:17). Again: </p>
<p>     I do help thee, saith Jehovah, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel (Isa. 41:14). The expressions "the 
Holy One of Israel," and "the God of Israel" occur many times. That the Lord is the Holy One of Israel and the God of Israel is clearly evident in that: </p>
<p>     They saw the God of Israel, and there 
was under His feet as it were a work of sapphire stone, and as it were the substance of heaven for clearness (Exod. 24:10). [2] No other was acknowledged and called Jehovah by the Jewish Church, for 
it worshiped the one God Jehovah, and this was the more fully the case for the reason-which was unknown to most of them-that all the rites of that church represented the Lord, and all the things of the 
Word in the internal sense were significative of Him. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     He will swallow up death forever; and the Lord Jehovih will wipe away the tear from off all faces. And it shall be said in that 
day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for Him, and He will save us; this is Jehovah, we have waited for Him; let us exult and be glad in his salvation (Isa. 25:8-9); </p>
<p>treating of the coming of the 
Lord.  [3] In the same: </p>
<p>     Behold the Lord Jehovih will come in strength, and His arm shall rule for Him. He shall feed His flock like a shepherd, He shall gather the little lambs in His arm, He 
shall carry them in His bosom, He shall lead the sucklings (Isa. 40:10-11). Here the Lord is plainly spoken of, who is "the Lord Jehovih." That He "shall come in strength," and "His arm rule for Him," 
signifies that He would conquer the hells by His own power; to "feed His flock, gather the little lambs in His arm, carry them in His bosom, and lead the sucklings," are predicated of His love or mercy. 
 [4] Again: </p>
<p>     Thus said Jehovah that created the heavens, God Himself that formed the earth and made it, He established it, He created it not an emptiness, He formed it to be inhabited: I am 
Jehovah, and there is none else. Am not I Jehovah, and there is no God else besides Me? a just God, and a Saviour, there is none besides Me. Look unto Me and be saved, all the ends of the earth; for 
I am God, and there is none else (Isa. 45:18, 21-22). Here the Lord is manifestly spoken of as being alone Jehovah and God. That to "create the heavens and form the earth" is to regenerate, thus that 
the Creator of heaven and earth is the Regenerator, may be seen above at n. 16, 88, 472, and elsewhere; and therefore the Lord is often called the Creator, Former, and Maker.  [5] Again: </p>
<p>     Thou 
art our Father, for Abraham knoweth us not, and Israel doth not acknowledge us. Thou, O Jehovah, art our Father, our Redeemer, Thy name is from everlasting (Isa. 63:16). Here the Lord is plainly meant, 
who alone is the "Redeemer." In Moses: </p>
<p>     Take heed of His face, and hear His voice, provoke Him not, for He will not bear your transgression, for My name is in the midst of Him (Exod. 23:21). That 
"name" means essence, see above (n. 144, 145); and "in the midst" means the inmost (n. 1074).  [6] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given; and the government shall be upon 
His shoulder; and His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, God, Hero, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace (Isa. 9:6), plainly said of the Lord. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Behold the days come that I 
will raise unto David a righteous offshoot, and He shall reign a King, and shall act intelligently, and shall do judgment and justice in the earth; in His days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall 
dwell in confidence; and this is His name whereby they shall call Him, Jehovah our Righteousness (Jer. 23:5-6), plainly meaning the Lord. In Zechariah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah shall be King over all the earth; 
in that day there shall be one Jehovah, and His name one (Zech. 14:9), plainly speaking of the Lord. The "name" denotes the essence. </p>

The fact that the Lord is Jehovah, who is here called 'God Most High', is quite clear from the Word: in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>

<p>Here it is explicitly stated that 'the Redeemer and Holy One of Israel', who is the Lord alone, is 'Jehovah Zebaoth' and 'the God of the whole earth'. In the 
same prophet, </p>

</blockquote>
<p>The expressions 'the Holy One of Israel' and 'the God of Israel' occur many times. That the Lord is the Holy One of Israel and the God of Israel is quite clear from where it is said 
that they saw the God of Israel, under whose feet there was so to speak a paved work of sapphire stone, like the substance of the sky for purity, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2024:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 24:10</a>. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 None other was acknowledged and 
called Jehovah by the Jewish Church because that Church worshipped the one God Jehovah, and more importantly, because all the religious observances of that Church represented Him -- though the majority 
did not know this- and because all things in the internal sense of the Word had Him as their meaning. In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
He will swallow up death for ever, and the Lord Jehovih will wipe away tears from 
all faces. And it will be said on that day, Behold, this is our God, we have waited for Him and He will save us. This is Jehovah, whom we have waited for; let us be glad and rejoice in His salvation. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2025:8,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 25:8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Coming of the Lord.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, the Lord Jehovih will come with might, and His arm will exercise dominion for Him. He will pasture His 
flock like a shepherd, He will gather into His arm, He will carry the tiny lambs in His bosom,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and will lead those that give suck. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2040:10,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 40:10, 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers explicitly to the Lord who is 'the Lord 
Jehovih'. 'He will come with might, and His arm will exercise dominion for Him' stands for the fact that He would by His own power overcome the hells. 'Pasturing the flock', 'gathering into His arm', 
'carrying the tiny lambs in His bosom', and 'leading those that give suck' have reference to His love, or mercy. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said Jehovah, God Himself who created the heavens, 
who formed the earth and made it, who Himself established it and created it not an emptiness, and formed it to dwell in: I am Jehovah, and there is none else. Am not I Jehovah and there is no God 
else besides Me? A just God, and a Saviour, there is none besides Me. Look to Me and be saved, all ends of the earth. For I am God and there is no other. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2045:18,%2021,%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 45:18, 21, 22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here it is explicitly stated 
that the Lord alone is Jehovah and God. 'To create the heavens and form the earth' is to regenerate, and so 'the Creator of heaven and earth' is the Regenerator, see <a href="16.htm">16</a>, <a href="88.htm">88</a>, <a href="472.htm">472</a>, and elsewhere. 
This is why the Lord is in various places called Creator, One who forms, and Maker. </p>
<p></p>

<p>This refers explicitly to the Lord who alone is the Redeemer. In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Take notice of His face,<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> and hearken 
to His voice, lest you provoke Him, for He will not endure your transgression, for My name is in the midst of Him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2023:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 23:21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Name' is the essential nature, see <a href="144.htm">144</a>, <a href="145.htm">145</a>, while 'in the midst' 
is the inmost, <a href="1074.htm">1074</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
To us a Boy is born, to us a Son is given; and the government will be upon His shoulder. His name will be called, Wonderful, Counsellor, God, Hero, Father 
of Eternity, Prince of Peace. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%209:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 9:6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This plainly refers to the Lord. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, the days are coming and I will raise up for David a righteous branch and He will reign as King, and 
act with understanding, and execute judgement and righteousness in the land. In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell with confidence. And this is His name which they will call Him, Jehovah 
our Righteousness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2023:5,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 23:5, 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This plainly refers to the Lord. In Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah will be King over all the earth; in that day there will be one Jehovah, and His name one. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%2014:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 14:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This 
is plainly a reference to the Lord. 'Name' stands for Essential Nature.

Quod Dominus sit Jehovah, Qui hic appellatur Deus Altissimus, constat manifeste ex Verbo; apud Esaiam, Jehovah Zebaoth nomen Ipsius, et Redemptor tuus, Sanctus Israelis, Deus totius terrae appellatur, 
liv 5; </p>
<p>ubi manifeste, quod 'Redemptor et Sanctus Israelis, Qui solus Dominus,' sit Jehovah Zebaoth, et Deus totius terrae: apud eundem, Sic dixit Jehovah Redemptor tuus, Sanctus Israelis, Ego Jehovah 
Deus tuus, xlviii 17: </p>
<p>apud eandem, Ego auxilior tibi, dictum Jehovae, Redemptor tuus, Sanctus Israelis, xli 14. Sanctus Israelis et Deus Israelis multoties dicitur; quod Dominus sit Sanctus Israelis 
et Deus Israelis, constat manifeste, Quod viderint Deum Israelis, sub pedibus Ipsius sicut opus lapidis sapphiri, et sicut substantia caeli quoad puritatem, Exod. xxiv 10; </p>
<p>[2] Ecclesia Judaica 
nec alium agnovit et appellavit Jehovam, quia unum Deum Jehovam coluit; et hoc eo magis quod plerisque eorum ignotum, quia omnes ritus Ecclesiae Ipsum repraesentabant; et omnia Verbi in sensu interno 
Ipsum significabant: apud Esaiam, Absorbebit mortem ni sempiternum, et absterget Dominus Jehovih lacrimam desuper omnibus faciebus;...et dicet in die illo, Ecce Deus noster Hic, exspectavimus Ipsum, 
et salvabit nos; Hic Jehovah, Quem exspectavimus, exsultemus et laetemur in salute Ipsius, xxv 8, 9; </p>
<p>[3] ubi de Adventu Domini: apud eundem, Ecce Dominus Jehovih in forti veniet, et brachium Ipsius 
dominans Ipsi;  ...sicut pastor gregem Suum pascet, in brachium Suum colliget, {1}agnellos in gremio suo portabit, lactentes ducet, xl 10, 11; </p>
<p>ubi manifeste de Domino Qui 'Dominus Jehovih'; 'in forti 
veniet et brachium Ipsius dominans Ipsi' pro quod propria potentia victurus inferna: 'pascere gregem, in brachium colligere, agnellos in gremio portare, lactentes ducere,' praedicantur de amore seu 
misericordia Ipsius: apud eundem, [4] Sic dixit Jehovah, creans caelos Ipse Deus, formans terram et faciens illam, Ipse firmans illam, non inanitatem creavit illam, ad habitandum formavit illam; Ego 
Jehovah et non praeterea....Nonne Ego Jehovah et non praeterea Deus praeter Me? Deus justus, et Salvator non praeter Me; respicite ad Me, et salvemini omnes fines terrae; quia Ego Deus et non praeterea, 
xlv 18, 21, 22; </p>
<p>ubi manifeste de Domino, quod solus Jehovah et Deus; quod 'creare caelos et formare terram' sit regenerare, ita 'Creator caeli et terrae' sit Regenerator, videatur n. 16, 88, 472, 
et alibi; quare Dominus passim appellatur Creator, Formator, Factor: apud eundem, [5] Tu Pater noster, quia Abraham non cognoscit nos, et Israel non agnoscit nos; Tu Jehovah, Pater noster, Redemptor 
noster, a saeculo nomen Tuum, lxiii 15, 16; </p>
<p>ubi manifeste de Domino Qui solus Redemptor: apud Mosen, Caveto tibi a faciebus Ipsius, et audi vocem Ipsius, ne exacerbes Ipsum, quia non sustinebit praevaricationem 
vestram, quoniam nomen Meum in medio Ipsius, Exod. xxiii 21; </p>
<p>quod 'nomen' sit essentia, videatur n. 144, 145; et 'in medio' sit intimum, n. 1074: apud Esaiam, [6] Puer natus est nobis, 
Filius datus est nobis, et erit principatus super humero Ipsius; vocabitur nomen Ipsius, Mirabilis, Consiliarius, Deus, Heros, Pater aeternitatis, Princeps pacis, ix 5, 6; </p>
<p>manifeste quod Dominus: apud 
Jeremiam, Ecce dies venientes et suscitabo Davidi germen justum, et regnabit Rex, et intelligenter aget, et faciet judicium et justitiam in terra; in diebus Ipsius salvabitur Jehudah, et Israel habitabit 
confidenter; et hoc nomen Ipsius quod appellabunt Ipsum, Jehovah justitia nostra, xxiii 5, 6; </p>
<p>manifeste quod Dominus: apud Zachariam, Erit Jehovah in Regem super totam terram; in die illo erit 
Jehovah unus, et nomen Ipsius unum, xiv 9; </p>
<p>manifeste de Domino: 'nomen' pro Essentia. @1 In all other refs. to this passage S. has agnos or agnellos with comma after, in agreement with Heb., not 
before as here.$  </p>
