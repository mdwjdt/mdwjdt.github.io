<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4929.</strong>“那手上有染过两次的线的”表承认这是良善。这从以下事实清楚可知，他现在凭手上染过两次的线而得到承认，因而是良善打开子宫，或是那头生的，得到承认。收生婆将染过两次的线拴在他手上，表示她作了记号，以表明哪一个是头生的，因而此处所表示的是承认。</p>

That had the double-dyed upon his hand. That this signifies acknowledgment that it is good, is evident from the fact that he was now acknowledged from the double-dyed upon his hand, thus it was acknowledged 
that it was good which opened the womb, or which was the firstborn. By the midwife's binding double-dyed upon his hand is signified that she marked who was the firstborn, and hence acknowledgment 
is here signified. </p>

'On whose hand was the twice-dyed thread' means the acknowledgement that good is such. This is clear from the fact that he was then acknowledged to be the firstborn because of 'the twice-dyed thread 
on his hand', thus that it was good which opened the womb or was the firstborn. The midwife binding on his hand a twice-dyed thread means that she provided a sign to indicate which one was the firstborn, 
and therefore acknowledgement is meant here. </p>

`Cujus super manu dibaphum': quod significet agnitionem quod bonum, constat ex eo quod nunc agnitus fuerit ex `dibapho super manu', ita quod esset bonum quod aperuit uterum seu quod primogenitum 
erat {1}; per quod `obstetrix ligavit super manu dibaphum' significatur {2} quod signaverit quis primogenitus esset, inde agnitio hic significatur. @1 est$ @2 significabatur$ </p>
