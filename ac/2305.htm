<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2305节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2305.</strong>有些人以为纯真就是婴孩的样子，因为主谈到小孩子时说，这就是天堂，若不变成小孩子的样式，人就不能进天国。但是，凡这样想的人都不知道圣言的内义，因此也不知道“婴孩”是什么意思。“婴孩”是指聪明和智慧的纯真，其性质是这样，他们承认他们唯独通过主拥有生命，主是他们唯一的父。因为人之所以为人是因着真理的聪明和良善的智慧，而他唯独通过主拥有这些东西。纯真本身在圣言中被称为“婴孩”，它只存在于或居于智慧中，以至于人越智慧，就越纯真。故，主是纯真本身，因祂是智慧本身。</p>

There are some who suppose that innocence is the same as infancy, for the reason that the Lord said of little children that of such is heaven; and that they who do not become as little children cannot 
enter into the kingdom of the heavens. But they who so imagine do not know the internal sense of the Word, nor therefore what is meant by "infancy." By "infancy" is meant the innocence of intelligence 
and wisdom, which is such that they acknowledge that they have life from the Lord alone, and that the Lord is their only Father; for that man is man is from the intelligence of truth and the wisdom 
of good, which he has solely from the Lord. Innocence itself, which in the Word is called "infancy," has no existence or abode except in wisdom; so much so that the wiser one is, the more innocent he 
is; on which account the Lord is innocence itself, because wisdom itself. </p>

There are certain people who identify innocence with early childhood, for the reason that the Lord, when speaking about young children, said that heaven consisted of such, and that those who do not become 
as young children cannot enter the kingdom of heaven. But those who think in this fashion do not know the internal sense of the Word, nor thus what is meant by early childhood. 'Early childhood' 
is used to mean the innocence that belongs to intelligence and wisdom, the nature of which is such that they acknowledge that they possess life solely from the Lord and that the Lord is their one and 
only Father; for a person is human because of intelligence and wisdom - essentially truth and good respectively - which people have solely from the Lord. Innocence itself, which in the Word is called 
early childhood, exists and resides nowhere else than within wisdom, so much so that the wiser anyone is the more innocent he is. Consequently the Lord is Innocence itself, because He is Wisdom itself. </p>

</p><b>2305.</b>
Quidam sunt, qui autumant innocentiam (t)idem esse cum infantia, ex causa quia Dominus de infantibus dixit, quod talium sit caelum, et qui non fiunt sicut infantes, [quod] non possint intrare in regnum 
caelorum; sed qui ita autumant, non sciunt internum sensum Verbi, et sic quid per infantiam intelligitur; per `infantiam' intelligitur innocentia intelligentiae et sapientiae, quae talis est ut agnoscant 
se a Domino solum vitam habere, et Dominum esse unicum eorum Patrem, nam quod homo sit homo, est ab intelligentia veri et sapientia boni, quam unice habent a Domino; ipsa Innocentia, quae {1} 
vocatur in Verbo infantia, nusquam est et habitat quam in sapientia, usque adeo ut quo sapientior quis est, eo sit innocentior; quare Dominus est Ipsa Innocentia quia Ipsa Sapientia. 	@1 The remainder
