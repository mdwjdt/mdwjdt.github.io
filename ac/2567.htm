<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2567节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2567.</strong>“仆婢”表也富有理性真理与属世真理，以及对它们的情感。这从“仆婢”的含义清楚可知。仆婢在圣言中经常被提及，就内义而言，他们表示那些相对低级或价值低的事物，如相对属灵和属天之物的理性和属世之物。属世真理是指各种记忆知识，因为这些东西是属世的。在圣言中，仆婢具有这样的含义从提及他们的那些经文的内义明显看出来。如以赛亚书：<br />耶和华要怜恤雅各，必再拣选以色列，将他们安置在本地，寄居的必与他们联合，紧贴雅各家。列民必接受他们，将他们带回故里；以色列家必在耶和华的地上得他们为仆婢。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.1.htm">14:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.2.htm">2</a>）<br />此处“雅各”表外在教会；“以色列”表内在教会；“寄居的”表在真理与良善方面接受教导的人（参看<a href="1463.htm">1463</a>，<a href="2025.htm">2025</a>节）；“仆婢”表属世真理和理性真理，以及对它们的情感，它们要服务于“雅各和以色列”所表示的教会。很明显，此处并非指雅各和以色列，或犹太人和以色列人，因为他们分散于外邦人中时，已变成外邦人。然而，犹太人仍铭记这个预言，并期待它照字面意义实现，即寄居的必与他们联合，列民必将他们带回故里，并成为他们的仆婢。而事实上，在圣言的预言部分，凡论及犹太人和以色列人的地方，所表示的事没有一丁点是涉及这些人的。犹太人自己从以下事实也必然清楚看出来：经上论及色列被带回与论及犹大一样频繁。<br />同一先知书：<br />看哪，耶和华使地空虚，变为荒凉；祂必扭曲地面，将它的居民分散。那时百姓怎样，祭司也怎样；仆人怎样，主人也怎样；婢女怎样，主母也怎样。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.1.htm">24:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.2.htm">2</a>）<br />此处“地”表教会（<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>，<a href="1067.htm">1067</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>节），当“百姓和祭司”所表示的内在真理与良善，以及“仆人和婢女”所表示的外在真理与良善不复存在时，它变得“空虚、荒凉，地面扭曲，居民分散”；当外在事物统治内在事物时，这种情形就会发生。<br /><br />我必从雅各中领出种，从犹大中领出承受我众山的。我的选民必承受它；我的仆人要在那里居住。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.9.htm">65:9</a>）<br />此处“雅各”表外在教会；“犹大”表内在的属天教会；“选民”表它的良善；“仆人”表它的真理。<br />约珥书：<br />我要将我的灵浇灌凡有血气的。你们的儿女要说预言。在那些日子，我要将我的灵浇灌我的仆人和婢女。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.28.htm">2:28</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.29.htm">29</a>）<br />此处论述的主题是主的国度；“说预言”表教导（<a href="2534.htm">2534</a>节）；“儿（子）”表真理本身（<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>节）；“女（儿）”表良善本身（<a href="489.htm">489</a>-<a href="491.htm">491</a>节）；“仆人和婢女”表低级的真理与良善，当这些支持并确认时，经上就说灵要“浇灌”它们。“仆人和婢女”在此表示这类事物并不怎么明显，既因对仆人和婢女的普遍观念，也因这个预言带有某种历史意味。<br />启示录：<br />我又看见一位天使站在日头中，向空中所飞的一切鸟大声喊着说，你们可以吃君王的肉与将军的肉，壮士的肉与马和骑马者的肉，并自主的、为奴的、大的、小的，所有人的肉。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.17.htm">19:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.18.htm">18</a>）<br />此处显而易见，他们要吃的并不是君王、将军、壮士、马，以及那些坐席之人的肉；而是教会的内在与外在真理成为他们的“肉”。<br />“仆人”表真理，“婢女”表良善，它们服从、因而服务于属灵和属天的真理与良善。这一点从代表性教会针对仆婢所制定的律法看得更清楚。所有这些律法都与教会和主国度的状态有关，无论总体还是细节，也与低级的真理与良善，或那些属世和理性之物要服务于那些属灵和属天之物，因而服务于那些神性之物的方式有关。如：<br />希伯来奴仆和希伯来女奴第七年可以自由，那时，要从羊群、禾场、酒榨之中，多多地给他。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出21.2.htm">21:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出21.6.htm">6</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申15.12.htm">15:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申15.15.htm">15</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶34.9.htm">34:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶34.14.htm">14</a>）<br />仆人的妻子若与他一同服役，她要自由；他主人若给他妻子，妻子和儿女要归主人。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出21.3.htm">21:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出21.4.htm">4</a>）<br />穷乏的弟兄若将自己卖给你，不可叫他像奴仆服事你。他要像雇工人和寄居的一样，到了禧年，他和他儿女要一同出去。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利25.39.htm">25:39</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利25.43.htm">43</a>）<br />弟兄若卖给外邦寄居的，可以将他赎回，到了禧年，要出去。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利25.47.htm">25:47</a>等）<br />奴仆和婢女可以从四围的民族和寄居的外人中买，他们要作他们永远的产业。他们可严严地辖管他们，只是以色列人，不可严严地辖管。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利25.44.htm">25:44</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利25.46.htm">46</a>）<br />奴仆若不愿意自由出去。要靠近门框，用锥子穿他的耳朵，他就永远作仆人；婢女也一样。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出21.6.htm">21:6</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申15.16.htm">15:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申15.17.htm">17</a>）<br />人若用棍子打奴仆或婢女，以致他死亡，他必要受刑；若能撑过一两天，就可以不受刑，因为那奴仆是他的银钱。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出21.20.htm">21:20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出21.21.htm">21</a>）<br />人若打坏了奴仆的一只眼或一个牙，他要去得自由。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出21.26.htm">21:26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出21.27.htm">27</a>）<br />牛若触了奴仆或是婢女，以致他死了，牛的主人必须偿还奴隶的主人三十块银子，而牛要用石头打死。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出21.32.htm">21:32</a>）<br />如果有奴隶逃离主人，不要压迫他，要由他选择一个地方居住，你不可欺负他。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申23.15.htm">23:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申23.16.htm">16</a>）<br />用银子买的奴仆，既受了割礼，就可以吃逾越节。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.44.htm">12:44</a>）<br />人被卖的女儿不可像男仆那样出去。若她是恶的，她的主人不能把她卖给外人；若选定她给自己的儿子，就当待她如同女儿；若另娶一个，那女子的吃食、衣服并好合的事，仍不可减少；若不向她行这些事，她就可以不用钱赎，白白地出去。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出21.7.htm">21:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出21.11.htm">11</a>）<br />所有这些律法都起源于天上真理与良善的律法，在内义上部分通过对应，部分通过代表，部分通过象征而指向它们。但在教会的代表和象征物，也就是最外在、最低等的敬拜之物被废除后，这些律法也就没有存在的必要了。因此，如果这些源于真理良善的秩序，以及代表物和象征物的律法展开的话，那么显然，“男仆”除了表示相对低级，因而理应服侍属灵真理的理性和记忆真理之外，并不表示别的；而“女仆”则表示伴随这些真理的良善，它们也较为低级，事实上理应以另一种方式去服侍。正因如此，针对女仆所制定的某些律法不同于针对男仆的。因为就本身而言，真理比伴随它们的良善更象是仆人。<br />在撒母耳记中，“王权”在内义上只表示真理的“权利”，当虚假开始统治真理与良善时，同样表示虚假的“权利”。这从描述王权的这些经文的解读明显看出来：<br />管辖你们的王权必这样行：他必取你们的儿子，派他们为他赶车，做他的马兵，在他的车前奔走；他必取你们的女儿作配香膏的、烧饭的和烤饼的；又必取你们的仆人婢女、健壮的少年人和你们的驴，叫他们为他效劳；你们的羊群，他必取十分之一，你们也必作仆人。到那日子，你们必因你们为自己所选的王而哀叫，到那日子，耶和华却不应允你们。（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上8.11.htm">8:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上8.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上8.16.htm">16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上8.18.htm">18</a>）<br />“王”表真理（参看<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>节），因而在反面意义上表非真理，也就是虚假。他派去赶车、做马兵的儿子表教义的真理，它们要屈服于“战车和马兵”所表示的虚假原则。他取来作配香膏的、烧饭的和烤饼的女儿表教义的良善，它们使这些虚假充满快乐，并变得可接受。他要取来“为他效劳”的男仆、女仆、少年人和驴表理性事物和记忆知识，那些虚假通过它们被确认。他必取“十分之一的羊群”表良善的余留，他要向它们施暴。他们“必作仆人”表圣言与教义的属天和属灵之物不是进行统治，而是屈服，以至于确认他原则里面的虚假，和他欲望里面的邪恶。因为任何事物都能要么通过虚假应用、要么通过错误解读，要么通过歪曲，要么通过拒绝那些不支持的东西而被引入虚假原则。正因如此，经上才补充说：“到那日子，你们必因你们为自己所选的王而哀叫，到那日子，耶和华却不应允”。</p>

And menservants and maidservants. That this signifies that it was enriched also with rational truths and natural truths, as well as with the affections of them, is evident from the signification of "menservants 
and maidservants." These are frequently mentioned in the Word, and by them are signified in the internal sense things that are relatively lower and of less value, such as are rational and 
natural things in comparison with spiritual and celestial things. By natural truths are meant memory-knowledges of every kind, for these are natural. That in the Word these are signified by "menservants 
and maidservants," is manifest from the internal sense of the words where they are mentioned, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah will have compassion on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and will set them 
upon their own ground; and the sojourner shall cleave unto them, and shall join themselves unto the house of Jacob; and the peoples shall take them, and shall bring them to their own place; and the 
house of Israel shall possess them for themselves upon the ground of Jehovah for menservants and for maidservants (Isa. 14:1-2), [2] where "Jacob" denotes the external church; "Israel," the internal; 
"sojourners," those who are being instructed in truths and goods (see n. 1463, 2025); "menservants and maidservants," natural and rational truths together with the affections of them, which are to serve 
the church meant by "Jacob and Israel." It is evident that Jacob and Israel are not meant here, nor the Jews and Israelites, for the latter when dispersed among the Gentiles became Gentiles. The Jews 
still cherish this prophecy and expect its fulfillment, even according to the letter, namely, that sojourners will cleave to them, that the people will bring them to their place, and will be to them 
for menservants and maidservants; when yet not even the smallest thing is to be understood of the Jews and Israelites in the prophecies of the Word where these are mentioned; as must be evident even 
to themselves from the fact that it is often said of Israel equally as of Judah that they shall be brought back. [3] Again in the same Prophet: </p>
<p>     Behold, Jehovah maketh the earth empty, and emptieth 
it out, and will disfigure the face of it, and scatter the inhabitants thereof; and it shall be, as the people, so the priest; as the servant, so his master; as the maidservant, so her mistress 
(Isa. 24:1-2). Here the "earth" denotes the church (n. 662, 1066, 1068, 1850), which is made empty and is emptied out, and its face is disfigured, and its inhabitants scattered, when there are no longer 
any interior truths and goods, which are the "people and the priest," nor any exterior truths and goods, which are the "servant" and the "maidservant," as comes to pass when external things rule over 
internal things. [4] Again: </p>
<p>     I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob and out of Judah an inheritor of My mountain, and My chosen shall possess it, and My servants shall dwell there (Isa. 65:9), where 
"Jacob" denotes the external church; "Judah," the internal celestial church; the "chosen," its goods; and the "servants," its truths. [5] In Joel: </p>
<p>     I will pour out My spirit upon all flesh, 
and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy; also upon the servants and the maidservants will I pour out My spirit in those days (Joel 2:28-29); </p>
<p>where the Lord's kingdom is treated of; "to 
prophesy" denotes to teach (n. 2534); "sons," truths themselves (n. 489, 491, 533, 1147) "daughters," goods themselves (n. 489-491) "servants" and "maidservants," lower truths and goods, upon which the 
spirit is said to be poured out when they accede and confirm. That such things are signified by "menservants and maidservants" here and elsewhere, does not so appear, by reason both of the common idea 
respecting menservants and maidservants, and of the apparent history.  [6] In John: </p>
<p>     I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried with a loud voice, saying to the birds that fly in the midst 
of heaven, Eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of them that sit thereon, and the flesh of all, both of free and bond, both of 
small and great (Rev. 19:17, 18). It is here evident that it is not the flesh of kings, of captains, of mighty men, of horses, of those who sit on them, of the free and of the bond, which they should 
eat; but that it is the truths of the church, both internal and external, that were made "flesh" for them.  [7] That "menservants" signify truths, and "maidservants" goods, which are subservient to 
and thus serve spiritual and celestial truths and goods, is more clearly evident from the laws enjoined in the Representative Church in regard to menservants and maidservants; which laws all have regard 
to the state of the church and of the Lord's kingdom in general and in particular; and to the way in which lower truths and goods, or those which are natural and rational, are to serve those which 
are spiritual and celestial, and thereby those which are Divine. For example: The Hebrew manservant and the Hebrew maidservant were to be free in the seventh year, and were then to be endowed from the 
flock, the threshing-floor, and the wine-press (Exod. 21:2, 6; Deut. 15:12-15; Jer. 34:9-14): The servant's wife was to be free if she entered into service with him; but if the master gave him his wife, 
the wife and children were to be the master's (Exod. 21:3, 4): A poor brother who had been purchased was not to serve as a bondservant, but as a hired servant and a sojourner; at the jubilee he was 
to go out together with his children (Lev. 25:39-43): If a brother were bought by a foreign sojourner, he might be redeemed, and was to go out in the year of the jubilee (Lev. 25:47, etc.): Menservants 
and maidservants might be bought of the nations around, and of the sons of foreign sojourners, and they were to be their perpetual possession, whom they might rule absolutely, but not the sons of 
Israel (Lev. 25:44-46): If a manservant did not desire to go out of service, his ear was to be pierced with an awl, at the door, and he was to be a perpetual servant; and the same with a maidservant 
(Exod. 21:6; Deut. 15:16, 17): If anyone smote his manservant or his maidservant with a rod, so that he died, vengeance was to be taken on him; but if he survived a day or more, he was to be free, because 
he was his money (Exod. 21:20, 21): If he should smite a servant's eye or tooth, he was to go forth free (Exod. 21:26, 27): If an ox should gore a manservant or a maidservant so that he died, the 
owner was to pay thirty shekels to his master, and the ox was to be stoned (Exod. 21:32): A servant who had escaped from his master was not to be placed in confinement, but should dwell in the place 
where he chose, and was not to be afflicted (Deut. 23:15, 16): A servant bought with silver, and circumcised, was to eat of the Passover (Exod. 12:44): Anyone's daughter that was bought was not to go 
out of service like the manservants; if she were evil, her master was not to sell her to a stranger; if she were betrothed to his son, she was to be as a daughter; if he took another, he was not to diminish 
her food, her raiment, nor her duty of marriage; if these things were not done, she was to go out of service without price (Exod. 21:7-12).  [8] All these laws have their origin from the laws 
of truth and good in heaven, and in the internal sense have reference to them; partly by correspondences, partly by representatives, and partly by significatives. But after the representatives and significatives 
of the church (which were the most external and lowest things of worship) had been abolished, the necessity for these laws ceased also. Now if these laws were to be unfolded from the laws 
of order of truth and good, and from representatives and significatives, it would be plain that nothing else was meant by "menservants" than rational and memory truths [vera rationalia et scientifica], 
which are lower truths, and therefore ought to serve spiritual truths; and that by "maidservants" were signified the goods of these, which being also lower, ought to serve indeed, but in another manner; 
and therefore certain of the laws laid down respecting maidservants differ from those laid down respecting menservants; for regarded in themselves truths are more fully servants than their goods 
are. [9] By the "king's right," in Samuel, nothing else is signified in the internal sense than the "right" of truth, and likewise the "right" of falsity when it begins to rule over truth and over good; 
as is evident from the explication of the words by which this is described: </p>
<p>     This will be the right of the king that shall reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them to him over 
his chariots and for his horsemen, and they shall run before his chariots; he will take your daughters for perfumers, and for cooks, and for bakers; your menservants and your maidservants and your goodliest 
young men and your asses will he take and put them to his work; he will take the tenth of your flock; and ye shall be for servants. And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king whom ye 
have chosen for you, and Jehovah will not answer you in that day (1 Sam. 8:11, 13, 16-18). [10] That by a "king" is signified truths, may be seen above (n. 1672, 2015, 2069); thus in the opposite sense 
things that are not true, that is, falsities. By the "sons whom he would appoint for himself over his chariots and for his horsemen," are signified the truths of doctrine, which should be subservient 
to principles of falsity, which are the "chariots and horsemen." By the "daughters whom he should take for perfumers, cooks, and bakers," are signified the goods of doctrine, by which those falsities 
would be filled with delight; and which would be made to favor the falsities.  By the "menservants and maidservants, the young men, and the asses, by which he would do his work," are signified the 
things of reason and of memory-knowledge, by which those falsities would be confirmed. By the "flock of which he will take a tenth" are signified the remains of good that he would do violence to. And 
by their "being servants" is signified that it would come to pass that the celestial and spiritual things of the Word and of doctrine, instead of ruling, would be subservient to the confirmation of 
the falsities of his principles, and the evils of his cupidities. For there is nothing that cannot be injected into principles of falsity as confirmatory of them, either by a false application, by a wrong 
interpretation, by perversion, or by a rejection of those things which do not favor; and therefore it is added: "if ye cry out in that day because of your king whom ye have chosen for you, Jehovah 
will not answer in that day." </p>

'And men servants and women servants' means, and also with rational truths and natural truths, as well as with affections for these...... This is clear from the meaning of 'men servants and women servants'. 
Men servants and women servants are mentioned in various places in the Word, and in the internal sense they mean those things which are relatively lower or baser, as rational and natural things 
are in comparison with spiritual and celestial. By natural truths are meant facts of every kind, since these are natural. That men servants and women servants have this meaning in the Word is evident 
from the internal sense of these words where they are used, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah will have compassion on Jacob, and will still choose Israel, and will set them on their own ground, and the sojourner 
will attach himself to them, and they will join themselves to the house of Jacob. And the peoples will take them and bring them to their place, and the house of Israel will inherit them on Jehovah's 
ground as men servants and women servants. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2014:%201,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 14: 1, 2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Here 'Jacob' stands for the external Church, 'Israel' for the internal, 'sojourners' for people who receive instruction in truths and 
goods, <a href="1463.htm">1463</a>, <a href="2025.htm">2025</a>. 'Men servants and women servants' stands for natural truths and rational truths, together with the affections for them, which are to be of service to the Church meant by Jacob and 
Israel. The fact that Jacob and Israel, or Jews and Israelites, were not meant here, is quite evident, for once they had been dispersed among the gentiles the Israelites became gentiles. Yet the Jews 
still cherish and await an even literal fulfilment of this prophecy - that sojourners will attach themselves to them, and after that peoples will bring them [to their place] and will become their men 
servants and women servants. But in fact where reference is made in the prophetical parts of the Word to Jews and Israelites, not even the least thing is meant in regard to these, as must also be plain 
to the Jews themselves from the fact that in various places it is said equally of Israel as of Judah that they were to be led back. </p>

 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, Jehovah is emptying the earth 
and making it desolate, and He will disfigure the face of it and will cause its inhabitants to scatter. And it will be, as with the people so with the priest, as with the man servant so with his 
master, as with the woman servant so with her mistress. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2024:%201,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 24: 1, 2</a>.

inhabitants scattered', when interior truths and goods, meant by 'priest and people', and when exterior truths and goods, meant by 'man servant and woman servant', are no more, which comes about when 
external things have dominion over internal. </p>

will dwell there. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2065:%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 65: 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'Jacob' stands for the external Church, 'Judah' for the internal celestial Church, 'chosen ones' for its goods, and 'servants' for its truths. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Joel, </p>
<blockquote>
I 
will pour out My spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters will prophesy. Even on your men servants and women servants in those days I will pour out My spirit. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%202:-28,%2029&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 2:-28, 29</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The 
subject here is the Lord's kingdom. 'Prophesying' stands for teaching, <a href="2534.htm">2534</a>, 'sons' for truths themselves, <a href="489.htm">489</a>, <a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="533.htm">533</a>, <a href="1147.htm">1147</a>, 'daughters' for goods themselves, <a href="489.htm">489</a>-<a href="491.htm">491</a>. 'Men servants and women servants' 
stands for lower truths and goods on which it is said that the spirit is to be 'poured out' when these serve to support and strengthen. That such things are meant here and elsewhere by 'men servants 
and women servants' is not too apparent, both because of the common idea which one has of men servants and women servants, and because of this being a prophecy of some seemingly historical event. </p>

<p><b>[6]</b>
In John, </p>
<blockquote>
I saw an angel standing in the sun, who called out with a loud voice saying to all the birds flying in mid-heaven, You may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and 
the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and those seated on them, and the flesh of all, free men and slaves, both small and great. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2019:%2017,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 19: 17, 18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here it is quite plain that not the flesh 
of kings, captains, mighty men, horses, those seated on these, free men and slaves, which they were to eat, is meant but internal and external truths of the Church which became 'flesh' for them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
That 'men servants' means truths and 'women servants' goods which were subservient to and so serve spiritual and celestial truths and goods is quite clear from the laws laid down in the representative 
Church which had to do with men servants and woman servants. All these laws have regard to the state of the Church and of the Lord's kingdom in general and in particular, and to the way in which 
lower truths and goods, which are natural and rational, have to serve those that are spiritual and celestial, and thus those that are Divine, such as the following, </p>

<p><b>[8]</b>
 All these laws owe their existence 
to laws in heaven, which are laws to do with what is good and true. They also have regard in the internal sense to these laws in heaven, but they do so partly through correspondences, partly 
through representatives, and partly through meaningful signs. But when the representatives and the meaningful signs of that Church, which were the most external and lowest things of worship, were done 
away with, so also did the necessity for such laws come to an end. If therefore these laws which are derived from the laws of order to do with what is good and true, and from representatives and meaningful 
signs, were to be opened up [to reveal their inner reality], it would be evident that 'male slaves' means nothing else than truths of a rational and factual kind, which are lower truths and therefore 
ought to serve spiritual truths, and that 'female slaves' means accompanying goods which because they too are lower ought indeed to serve, though in a different way. This explains why certain laws 
laid down concerning female slaves or servants differed from those laid down concerning male ones. For regarded in themselves truths are servants much more than their accompanying goods. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 'The 
royal right' referred to in Samuel means nothing else in the internal sense than the right of truth, and also the right of falsity when it starts to have dominion over truth and over good, as becomes 
clear from the explanation of the words describing it, </p>
<blockquote>
This will be the king's right who will reign over you _ he will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots, and to his horsemen, and they 
will run before his chariots; he will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers; he will take your male slaves and your female slaves, and your best young men, and your asses, and will 
put them to do his work; he will take a tenth of your flock; and at length you yourselves will be made into slaves. And you will cry out on that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, 
but Jehovah will not answer you on that day. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1%20Sam%208:%2011,%2013,%2016-18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">1 Sam 8: 11, 13, 16-18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'A king' means truth, see <a href="1672.htm">1672</a>, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="2069.htm">2069</a>, and so in the contrary sense what are not truths, that is, falsities. The 
sons whom he would appoint to his chariots and to his horsemen mean truths of doctrine that would be subservient to false assumptions, which are meant by 'chariots and horsemen'. The daughters whom 
he would take to be perfumers, cooks, and bakers mean the goods of doctrine by which the falsities would be made pleasing and acceptable. The male slaves and female slaves, the young men, and the asses 
whom 'he will put to do his work' mean rational concepts and factual knowledge by means of which those falsities will be made stronger. 'The flock of which he will take a tenth' means remnants of good 
to which he will do violence. And the statement that they would be made into slaves means that instead of having dominion the celestial and spiritual things of the Word and of doctrine will be subservient 
so as to confirm the falsities within his assumptions and the evils within his desires. For nothing exists which cannot be introduced into false assumptions so as to confirm them, either by false 
application, or by a wrong interpretation, or by perversion, or by rejection of things which do not support those assumptions. It is for this reason that the words are added, 'If you cry out on that 
day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, Jehovah will not answer you on that day'.

<p>quod hic non sint carnes regum, chiliarchorum, fortium, equorum sedentium super iis, liberorum et servorum, quas comederent, patet sed quod vera 
Ecclesiae interna et externa quae iis `carnes' facta.  [7] Quod `servi' significent vera et `ancillae' bona quae inserviunt, et sic serviunt veris et bonis spiritualibus et caelestibus, manifestius 
constat a legibus in Ecclesia repraesentativa latis pro servis et ancillis, quae leges omnes spectant statum Ecclesiae (c)et regni Domini in {5} communi et {6} particulari, et quomodo vera et bona inferiora, 
quae sunt naturalia et rationalia, servitura sint spiritualibus et caelestibus, ita Divinis; ut quod 	Servus Hebraeus et {3} serva Hebraea septimo anno esset liber, et quod tunc donaretur de 
grege, de area, et torculari {8}, Exod. xxi 2-6; Deut. xv 12-15; Jer. xxxiv 9-14 {9}. 	(m)Quod uxor esset libera, si cum eo in servitium intraverit, si autem dominus dederit ei uxorem, quod uxor et

a peregrino inquilino, quod posset redimi, et quod exiret anno jubilaei, Lev. xxv 47 seq. 	Quod ex gentibus circum, emerentur servi et ancillae, et ex illis inquilinorum peregrinantium, quodque ii 
essent 	possessio eorum perpetua, quibus imperarent, non autem 	filiis Israelis, Lev. xxv 44-46. 	Quod servus si non vellet exire servitio, subula per aurem ejus ad ostium daretur, et esset servus,

7-11. [8] Hae omnes leges originem ducunt a legibus veri et boni in caelo, et ad illas se in sensu interno referunt, sed partim per correspondentia, partim per repraesentativa, et partim per significativa, 
at postquam Ecclesiae {11} repraesentativa et significativa, quae extima ac infima cultus fuerunt, abolita sunt, etiam illarum necessitas cessavit; si itaque leges istae, ex legibus ordinis veri 
et boni, et ex repraesentativis ac ex significativis evolverentur, pateret quod per `servos' nihil aliud significetur quam vera rationalia et scientifica, quae vera inferiora sunt, ac ideo servire 
debent veris spiritualibus, et quod per `ancillas' bona eorum, quae quia etiam inferiora (o)sunt, quidem servire debent sed alio modo, quare quaedam leges latae de ancillis differunt a legibus latis de 
servis; nam vera in se spectata sunt magis servi quam bona eorum. Per `jus regium' apud Samuelem, nec aliud in sensu interno significatur quam jus veri, et quoque jus falsi, cum dominari incipit super 
verum et super bonum, quod constare potest ab explicatione verborum per quae descriptum est, 	Hoc erit jus regis qui regnabit super vos, filios vestros sumet, et ponet sibi ad currus suos, et ad equites
