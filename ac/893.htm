<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第893节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>893.</strong>创世记8:13．到挪亚六百零一岁，正月初一日一开始，地上的水都干了，挪亚移开方舟的盖观看，看哪，土地面干了。<br />“到挪亚六百零一岁”表一个终点。“正月初一日一开始”表一个起点。“地上的水都干了”表这时虚假不再显现。“挪亚移开方舟的盖观看”表移走虚假后，他承认并相信的信之真理所流出的光明。“看哪，土地面干了”表重生。<br />893a.“到挪亚六百零一岁”表一个终点。这一点从数字六百的含义（如前所述，创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创7.6.htm">7:6</a>，<w1>737<w2>737<w3>节）明显可知。六百表一个开始，在那一节（7:6）尤表试探的开始，六百在此特指试探的结束，因为一整年过去了，因此一切都发生在年末，故经上补充说“正月初一日一开始”，以此表示一个起点，或一个新的开始。在圣言中，一日，一周，一月，一年，哪怕一百年，一千年，均表示任一个完整周期。例如，创世记第一章提到的“日”，它们表示上古教会成员重生的阶段。因为日和年的内义无非表示一个时间段，既表示一个时间段，也就表示一种状态。所以，在圣言中，一年表一段时间，也表一种状态。如以赛亚书：<br />报告耶和华的禧年，和我们神报仇的日子，安慰一切悲哀的人。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛61.2.htm">61:2</a>）<br />这论及主的到来。同一先知书：<br />报仇之日在我心中，救赎我民之年已经来到。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.4.htm">63:4</a>）<br />此处，“日”和“年”同样表一段时间，也表一种状态。在哈巴谷书：<br />耶和华啊，求你在这些年间复兴，在这些年间彰显。（哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈3.2.htm">3:2</a>）<br />此处，“年”表一段时间，也表一种状态。诗篇：<br />你就是神自己，你的年数没有穷尽。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗102.27.htm">102:27</a>）<br />这句经文（其中“年”表时间段）表明，在神那里没有时间。本节经文也一样，大洪水之“年”绝非表某个特定年份，而是表一个时间段，这个时间段不受具体年数的影响。同时它还表示一种状态（关于“年”的说明，可参看<a href="482.htm">482</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="488.htm">488</a>，<a href="493.htm">493</a>节）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]893.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_893/bible_king-james-version_genesis_8_13" target=_top>Genesis 8:13</a>. And it happened in the six hundred first year, in the beginning, on the first of the month, that the water drained off the earth; and Noah removed the roof of the ark and looked, and indeed the face of the ground had dried up!<br />It happened in the six hundred first year symbolizes an ending point. In the beginning, on the first of the month, symbolizes a starting point. The water drained off the earth means that falsity did not appear at that time. And Noah removed the roof of the ark and looked symbolizes the light of religious truth, once falsity had been removed — truth that they acknowledged and believed. And indeed the face of the ground had dried up symbolizes the process of rebirth.<br />[2] The symbolism of it happened in the six hundred first year as an ending point is established by the symbolism of six hundred, given at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_893/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_6" target=_top>Genesis 7:6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_893/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_737" target=_top>737</a>. Six hundred symbolizes a beginning and specifically, in that verse, the beginning of a time of trial. Its end is designated by the same number after a whole year has passed (so that it happened at the end of a year). That is the reason for adding in the beginning, on the first of the month, which symbolizes a starting point.<br />The Word designates any whole period by a day, week, month, or year, even if that period is a century or a millennium. An example is the "day" in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_893/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_1-31" target=_top>Genesis 1</a>, meaning the time it took a person in the earliest church to be reborn. On an inner plane, a day and a year just stand as symbols for a span of time, and since they are symbols for a span of time, they symbolize a state, so that a year throughout the Word is taken to stand for a time and a state. In Isaiah, for instance:<br />... to proclaim a year of good pleasure for Jehovah and a day of vengeance for our God, to comfort all who mourn. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_893/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_61_2" target=_top>Isaiah 61:2</a>)<br />This is about the Lord's Coming. In the same author:<br />The day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my redeemed had come. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_893/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_63_4" target=_top>Isaiah 63:4</a>)<br />Here too the day and year stand for a time and a state. In Habakkuk:<br />Jehovah, in the middle of the years, bring your work to life; in the middle of the years, please make it known. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_893/bible_king-james-version_habakkuk_3_2" target=_top>Habakkuk 3:2</a>)<br />The years stand for a time and a state. In David:<br />God, you are he, and your years are not used up. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_893/bible_king-james-version_psalms_102_27" target=_top>Psalms 102:27</a>)<br />The years stand for spans of time and for the fact that God is timeless. Likewise in the present verse the year of the Flood in no way means a year as such but a stretch of time lasting an undetermined number of years, and at the same time, a state. See previous discussions of years in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_893/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_482" target=_top>482</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_893/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_487" target=_top>487</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_893/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_488" target=_top>488</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_893/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_493" target=_top>493</a>. </p>

Verse 13. And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the beginning, on the first of the month, that the waters were dried up from off the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark, 
and saw, and behold, the faces of the ground were dry. "And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year" signifies a last boundary [or ending]; "in the beginning, on the first of the month" signifies 
a first boundary [or new beginning]; "the waters were dried up from off the earth" signifies that falsities did not then appear; "and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked" signifies 
on the removal of falsities there was the light of the truths of faith, which he acknowledged and in which he had faith; "and behold the faces of the ground were dry" signifies regeneration. And it 
came to pass in the six hundred and first year. That this signifies a last boundary, is evident from the signification of the number "six hundred" concerning which in the preceding chapter (Gen. 7:6, 
n. 737), as being a beginning, and there indeed the beginning of temptation, its end being here designated by the same number, a whole year having passed, so that what took place was at the end of the 
year, and therefore it is added, "in the beginning, on the first of the month" by which is signified a first boundary [or new beginning]. Any whole period is designated in the Word as a "day" a "week" 
a "month" a "year" even though it be a hundred or a thousand years, as the "days" in the first chapter of Genesis, by which are meant periods of the regeneration of the man of the Most Ancient Church; 
for "day" and "year" in the internal sense signify nothing else than a time, and because they signify a time they signify a state, and therefore in the Word a "year" is continually used with the meaning 
of a time and a state. As in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     To proclaim the acceptable year of Jehovah, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn (Isa. 61:2), where the coming of the Lord 
is treated of. Again: </p>
<p>     For the day of vengeance was in Mine heart, and the year of My redeemed had come (Isa. 63:4), where also "day" and "year" denote a time and state. In Habakkuk: </p>
<p>     O Jehovah, 
revive Thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known (Hab. 3:2), where "years" denote a time and state. In David: </p>
<p>     Thou art God Himself, and Thy years are not consumed 
(Ps. 102:27), where "years" denote times, and it is shown that with God there is no time. So in the passage before us, the year of the flood by no means signifies any particular year, but a time 
not determined by fixed years, and at the same time a state. (See what has been said before about "years" n. 482, 487, 488, 493.) </p>

Verse 13 And it happened in the six hundred and first year, at the beginning, on the first of the month, that the waters dried up from over the earth, and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and saw 
out, and behold, the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the ground was dry.  </p>
<p>'It happened in the six hundred and first year' means a finishing point. 'At the beginning, on the first of the month' means a starting point. 'The 
waters dried up from over the earth' means that falsities were not at that time apparent. 'And Noah removed the covering of the ark, and saw out' means the light, once falsities had been removed, 
shed by the truths of faith, which he acknowledged and in which he had faith. 'And behold, the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the ground was dry' means regeneration. <A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> lit. the faces </p>
<p>[<a href="893.htm">893</a>a]<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> That 'it happened in the six 
hundred and first year means a finishing point is clear from the meaning of the number six hundred, dealt with at Chapter 7:6, in <a href="737.htm">737</a>, as a beginning, and in particular in that verse as the beginning 
of temptation. The end of it is specified by the same number, with a whole year having now passed by. It took place therefore at the end of a year, and this also is why the words are added 'at the beginning, 
on the first of the month', meaning a starting point. In the Word any complete period is specified either by a day, or a week, or a month, or a year, and even by a hundred or a thousand years 
- for example, 'the days' mentioned in Genesis <a href="1.htm">1</a>, which meant stages in the regeneration of the member of the Most Ancient Church. For in the internal sense day and year mean nothing else than a period 
of time; and meaning a period of time they also mean a state. Consequently a year stands in the Word for a period of time and for a state, as in Isaiah,  </p>
<p>To proclaim the year of Jehovah's good 
pleasure, and the day of vengeance for our God; to comfort all who mourn. Isa. 61:2. </p>
<p>This refers to the Lord's Coming. In the same prophet, </p>
<p>The nay of vengeance was in My heart, and the year of 
My redeemed had come. Isa. 63:4. </p>
<p>Here too 'day' and 'year' stand for a period of time and for a state. In Habakkuk, </p>
<p>Your work, O Jehovah, in the midst of the years make it live, in the midst of 
the years do You make it known. Hab. 3:2. </p>
<p>Here 'years' stands for a period of time and for a state. In David,  </p>
<p> You are God Himself, and Your years have no end. Ps. 102:27.  </p>
<p>This statement, in 
which 'years' stands for periods of time, means that time does not exist with God. The same applies in the present verse where 'the year' of the flood in no way means any one particular year but a period 
of time that is not determined by a specific number of years. At the same time it means a state. See what has been said already about 'years' in <a href="482.htm">482</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="488.htm">488</a>, <a href="493.htm">493</a>.

Vers. 13.  Et factum in primo et sexcentesimo anno, in principio in primo mensis, aruerunt aquae de super terra, et removit Noah tectum arcae, et vidit, et ecce arefactae sunt facies humi. 'Quod factum 
in primo et sexcentesimo anno' significant terminum ultimum: 'in principio in primo mensis' significant terminum primum: 'aruerunt aquae de super terra' significant quod falsitates tunc non apparerent: 
'et removit Noah tectum arcae et vidit' significant remotis falsis lucem veritatum fidei quas agnovit et quibus fidem habuit: 'et ecce arefactae sunt facies humi' significant regenerationem. 	[2] 
Quod 'factum in primo et sexcentesimo anno' significent terminum ultimum, constat ex significatione numeri sexcenteni, de quo in cap. praec. vers. 6, n. 737, quod sit principium, et quidem ibi, principium 
tentationis; finis ejus designatur per eundem numerum, transacto integro anno, sic ut factum in fine anni; quare etiam adjicitur, quod 'in principio in primo mensis,' quo significatur terminus 
primus.  Tota aliqua periodus in Verbo designatur vel per diem, vel per septimanam, vel per mensem, vel per annum, immo si vel foret centum aut mille annorum, sicut 'dies' in primo capite Geneseos, per 
quem significatae sunt periodi regenerationis hominis Antiquissimae Ecclesiae; nam dies et annus nihil aliud in sensu interno significant quam tempus, et quia tempus, significant statum; quare annus 
pro tempore et statu passim sumitur in Verbo; ut apud Esaiam, 	Ad proclamandum annum beneplaciti Jehovae, et diem ultionis Deo nostro, ad consolandum omnes lugentes, lxi 2; </p>
<p>ubi de Adventu Domini: 
apud eundem, 	Dies ultionis in corde Meo, et annus redemptorum Meorum venerat, lxiii 4; </p>
<p>ubi quoque 'dies et annus' pro tempore et statu: apud Habakkuk, 	Jehovah opus Tuum in medio annorum vivifica 
illud; in medio annorum notum facias, iii 2; </p>
<p>ubi 'anni' pro tempore et statu: apud Davidem, 	Deus Tu Ipse, et anni Tui non consumuntur, Ps. cii 28 [A.V. 27]; </p>
<p>'anni' pro temporibus, et quod Deo non 
tempus: similiter hic 'annus,' qui fuit diluvii, nusquam significat aliquem annum, sed tempus non per certos annos determinatum, et simul statum; videantur quae prius de annis n. 482, 487, 488, 493. </p>
