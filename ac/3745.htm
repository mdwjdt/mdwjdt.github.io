<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3745.</strong>这种多样性何等之大，以及它的性质，可从人体内的多样性看出来。众所周知，没有哪两种器官或肢体是一样的。如，视觉器官就不同于听觉器官，同样不同于嗅觉器官、味觉器官，以及遍布全身的触觉器官。这也适用于肢体，如胳膊、手、下肢、脚和脚底；还适用于内脏，如头颅里面的，即大脑、小脑、延髓和脊髓，以及所有微小器官或内脏，血管，和构成它们的纤维；头部下面的人体器官，如心、肺、胃、肝、胰、脾、肠、肠系膜和肾脏，以及两性生殖器官。众所周知，其中每一个在形态和功能上都与众不同，并且差别如此之大，以至于完全不同。这同样适用于形态里面的形态，它们也具有这种多样性，以致没有哪两种形态，甚至没有哪两个微粒是完全一样的，也就是说，它们不会相像到彼此不经某种改变，无论多少微小的改变就能互相替代的地步。所有这些事物，无论总体还是细节，都对应于众天堂，不对对应的方式是这样：人所具有的肉体和物质事物在天堂是属天和属灵的。它们以这种方式对应，是为了它们能表现后者，并通过后者持续存在。</p>

How great this variety is, and of what nature, may be seen from the variety in the human body. It is known that one organ or member is not like another; for instance, that the organ of sight is not like 
the organ of hearing, and that the same is true of the organ of smelling, the organ of taste, and also the organ of touch, which last is diffused throughout the whole body. So also with the members-the 
arms, hands, loins, feet, and soles of the feet; and also with the viscera that lie hidden within, as those of the head, namely, the cerebrum, cerebellum, medulla oblongata, and medulla spinalis, 
with all the minute organs, viscera, vessels, and fibers of which they are composed; also those belonging to the body below the head, as the heart, lungs, stomach, liver, pancreas, spleen, intestines, 
mesentery, and kidneys; and also those which are appropriated to generation in both sexes. It is known that all of these both in general and in particular are dissimilar in form and in function; so 
dissimilar that they are entirely different. In like manner there are forms within forms, which also are of such variety that no one form, nor even one particle, is altogether like another, that is to 
say, so like that it may be substituted in place of it, without some alteration however slight. All these things in both general and particular correspond to the heavens, but in such a manner that the 
things with man that are corporeal and material are there celestial and spiritual; and they correspond in such a way that it is from this that they come forth and subsist. </p>

How far that variety extends, and the nature of it, becomes clear from the variety present in the human body. It is well known that no one organ or member is like another. For example, the organ of sight 
is unlike the organ of hearing, and likewise unlike the organ of smell, the organ of taste, and also the organ of touch which is spread throughout the whole body. The same applies to members, such 
as the arms, hands, lower limbs, feet, and soles of the feet; also to inlying viscera, such as those in the head, namely the cerebrum, cerebellum, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord, together with all 
the parts of organs or viscera, vessels, and fibres which compose them; and those of the body beneath the head, such as the heart, lungs, stomach, liver, pancreas, spleen, intestines, mesentery, and 
kidneys; and also the reproductive organs in both sexes. Every single one, as is well known, is in form and function unlike the rest, so unlike as to be totally different. The same applies to the forms 
within forms, which also are so varied that not one form, not even one individual part, is exactly like another, that is to say, so alike that it can take the place of another without some alteration, 
however tiny. All these, every one, correspond to the heavens, but in such a way that the bodily and material things with man are in heaven celestial and spiritual. They correspond in such a way 
that they are manifestations of the latter and are kept in being from the latter. </p>

Quanta et qualis varietas est, constare potest a varietate in corpore humano; notum est quod unum organum et membrum non sit simile alteri, sicut organum visus non est simile organo auditus, pariter 
organum olfactus, et organum gustus, et quoque organum tactus quod se per universum corpus diffundit; sic etiam membra, ut brachia, manus, lumbi, pedes, plantae; et quoque viscera quae intus latent, 
ut illa quae sunt capitis, nempe cerebrum, cerebellum, medulla oblongata, et medulla spinalis, cum omnibus organulis, viscerulis, vasis, et fibris, ex quibus illa; tum (c)ea quae sunt corporis 
infra caput, ut cor, pulmones, ventriculus, hepar, pancreas, lien, intestina, mesenterium, renes; et quoque (c)ea quae generationi dicata sunt in utroque sexu; quae omnia et singula quod inter se 
dissimilia sint quoad formas, et quoad functiones, et tam dissimilia ut prorsus differant, notum est; similiter formae intra formas, quae quoque tali varietate sunt ut non una forma, ne quidem una 
particula sit prorsus similis alteri, nempe ita similis, ut loco alterius substitui possit, absque aliqua, etiamsi pusilla, alteratione. Haec omnia et singula correspondent caelis, sed ita ut quae 
corporea et materialia sunt apud hominem, ibi sint caelestia et spiritualia; ac ita correspondent ut inde existant et subsistant. </p>
