<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7194节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7194.</strong>“至于我名耶和华，我未曾让他们知道”表那些属于属灵教会的人在试探的状态下没有想到教会所拥有的神性事物。这从“耶和华的名”和“未曾让知道”的含义清楚可知。“耶和华的名”是指藉以敬拜神的作为一个整体的一切事物（参看<a href="2724.htm">2724</a>，<a href="3006.htm">3006</a>，<a href="6674.htm">6674</a>节），因而是指教会里的一切神性事物。严格来说，“耶和华的名”表示主的神性人身（参看<a href="2628.htm">2628</a>，<a href="6887.htm">6887</a>节）；因为信的一切和爱的一切，也就是教会里的神性事物皆通过祂的神性人身而来，并从它发出；这人身表示作为一个整体构成神性敬拜的一切。“未曾让知道”是指在“沙代神”所表示的试探状态下，人们不知道，也就是没有想到这些事物，即教会里的神性事物的一种情况。正因如此，经上说祂为亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各所知，但至于祂的名耶和华，却未曾让他们知道。这就是这些话的内在意义；但外在意义或历史意义则不同。从外在或历史意义清楚可知，亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各并不拜耶和华，而是拜沙代神（<a href="1992.htm">1992</a>，<a href="3667.htm">3667</a>，<a href="5628.htm">5628</a>节），而且亚伯拉罕不认识耶和华（参看<a href="1356.htm">1356</a>，<a href="2559.htm">2559</a>节）。然而，“耶和华”这个名却出现在关于亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各的历史中；其原因在于，这部分圣言是摩西写的，而摩西知道耶和华的名，在这些历史中用耶和华的名是为了内义。因为在整部圣言中，当所论述的主题是爱之良善时，经上就用“耶和华”这个名，而当主题是信之真理时，经上就用“神”这个名（<a href="709.htm">709</a>，<a href="732.htm">732</a>，<a href="1096.htm">1096</a>，<a href="2586.htm">2586</a>，<a href="2769.htm">2769</a>，<a href="2807.htm">2807</a>，<a href="2822.htm">2822</a>，<a href="3921.htm">3921</a>e，<a href="4402.htm">4402</a>节）。</p>

And by My name Jehovah I was not known to them. That this signifies that they of the spiritual church in a state of temptations did not think of the Divine things of the church, is evident from the signification 
of the "name Jehovah," as being everything in one complex by which God is worshiped (see n. 2724, 3006, 6674), thus everything Divine in the church. By the "name Jehovah" is properly meant 
the Divine Human of the Lord (see n. 2628, 6887), and because by this and from it proceeds everything of faith and everything of love, which are the Divine things in the church, this is, in one complex, 
everything of Divine worship. And from the signification of "not being known," as being not to be known, or not to be thought of, that is to say, the Divine things of the church in the state of temptations 
which are signified by "God Shaddai"' and therefore it is said that He was known to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but not by His name Jehovah. This is the internal sense of these words; but the 
external or historic sense is different, and from this latter sense it is evident that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob did not worship Jehovah, but God Shaddai (n. 1992, 3667, 5628), and that Abraham knew 
not Jehovah (see n. 1356, 2559). But that "Jehovah" is named in the historicals concerning Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, is because that Word was written by Moses, to whom the name "Jehovah" was made known, 
and in these historicals "Jehovah" is named for the sake of the internal sense; for everywhere in the Word "Jehovah" is named when the subject treated of is the good of love, whereas "God" is named 
when it is the truth of faith (n. 709, 732, 1096, 2586, 2769, 2807, 2822, 3921, 4402). </p>

'And by My name Jehovah I was not known to them' means that in a state involving temptations those who belonged to the spiritual Church gave no thought to Divine things that the Church possesses. This 
is clear from the meaning of 'the name of Jehovah' as everything in its entirety by which God is worshipped, dealt with in <a href="2724.htm">2724</a>, <a href="3006.htm">3006</a>, <a href="6674.htm">6674</a>, thus everything Divine within the Church ('the name of Jehovah' 
is used strictly speaking to mean the Lord's Divine Human, <a href="2628.htm">2628</a>, <a href="6887.htm">6887</a>, and since the whole of faith and the whole of love, which are the Divine things within the Church, come through and from His 
Divine Human, everything in its entirety composing Divine worship is meant by that Human); and from the meaning of 'not being known' as a situation in which people have no knowledge of, that is, give 
no thought to those things - Divine things within the Church - that is to say, during a state involving temptations, which are meant by 'God Shaddai'. That is the reason why it says that He was known 
to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but not by His name Jehovah. This is the internal sense of these words; but the external or historical sense is different. From this sense it becomes clear that Abraham, 
Isaac, and Jacob did not worship Jehovah but God Shaddai, see <a href="1992.htm">1992</a>, <a href="3667.htm">3667</a>, <a href="5628.htm">5628</a>, and that Abraham did not know Jehovah, <a href="1756.htm">1756</a>, <a href="2559.htm">2559</a>. Yet the name Jehovah appears in the historical narratives concerning 
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and the reasons for this are that this part of the Word was written by Moses, to whom Jehovah's name was made known, and that Jehovah's name is used in those historical narratives 
for the sake of the internal sense. For throughout the Word Jehovah is used when the good of love is referred to, but God when the truth of faith is referred to, <a href="709.htm">709</a>, <a href="732.htm">732</a>, <a href="1096.htm">1096</a>, <a href="2586.htm">2586</a>, <a href="2769.htm">2769</a>, <a href="2807.htm">2807</a>, <a href="2822.htm">2822</a>, <a href="3921.htm">3921</a> (end), <a href="4402.htm">4402</a>. </p>

`{1}Et' nomine Meo Jehovah non notus sum illis': quod significet quod illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali in statu tentationum non cogitarent de Divinis quae Ecclesiae, constat ex significatione `nominis 
Jehovae' quod sit omne in uno complexu, quo colitur Deus, de qua n. 2724, 3006, 6674, ita omne Divinum {2}in Ecclesia; per `nomen Jehovae' proprie intelligitur Divinum Humanum Domini, n. 2628, 6887, 
et quia per Illud et ab Illo procedit omne fidei et omne amoris, quae sunt Divina in Ecclesia, est Illud in uno complexu omne cultus Divini; et ex significatione `non notus esse' quod sit non sciri, 
seu non cogitari de illis, hoc est, de Divinis quae {2}in Ecclesia, nempe in statu tentationum, quae per `Deum Schaddai' significantur; quare dicitur quod ille notus fuerit Abrahamo, Jischako, et Jacobo, 
non autem nomine Suo `Jehovah'; hic sensus internus {3}est horum verborum; {4}at sensus externus seu historicus alius est, ex hoc sensu constare potest quod Abraham, Jischak, et Jacob non coluerint 
Jehovam, sed Deum Schaddai, videatur n. 1992, 3667, 5628, et quod Abraham nesciverit Jehovam, n. 1356, 2559; quod autem in historicis de Abrahamo, Jischako, et Jacobo, nominetur Jehovah, est quia Verbum 
illud scriptum est a Mosche, cui nomen Jehovae notum factum est, et in historicis illis Jehovah nominatur ob sensum internum; nam ubivis in Verbo Jehovah nominatur cum de bono quod amoris agitur, 
at Deus cum de vero quod fidei, n. 709, 732, 1096, 2586, 2769, 2807, 2822, 3921 fin., 4402. 	@1 In I$ 	@2 Ecclesiae$ 	@3 After verborum$ 	@4 Ex sensu externo seu historico, hic$ </p>
