<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第224节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>224.</strong>慈悲、平安、良善，亦即“耶和华的面”，是有觉知者听到内在声音的原因，有良知者亦复如是，尽管途径有所不同。它们通常表现为怜悯，但也因各人的状态而异。那人此时的状态，亦即上古教会当前一代的状态，是处于属世之善。处于属世之善者，因赤身而在恐惧和羞耻中隐藏自己。连属世之善也缺乏的人，并不隐藏，因为他们已不觉羞耻。关于此等人，可参看耶利米书8:12-13（<a href="217.htm">217</a>节）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]224.</strong> Mercy, peace, and all that is good — Jehovah's face — are what give rise to the inner call in the case of those who have perception (and those who have conscience, too, but in a different way). These qualities always operate in a compassionate manner, but the way we receive them depends on our state.<br />The state of the human in this chapter, or of this generation of the earliest church, was one of earthly good. Those who live in earthly good are such that they hide themselves in fear and shame over their nakedness. Those who lack earthly good, however, do not even hide, because they are shameless. They are spoken of in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_224/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_8_12" target=_top>Jeremiah 8:12</a> and 13 (see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_224/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_217" target=_top>217</a> above). </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 224</b></p><p><b>224.</b>
Mercy, peace, and every good, or the "faces of Jehovah" are the cause of the dictate with those who have perception, and also, although in a different manner, with those who have conscience, and they 
always operate mercifully, but are received according to the state in which the man is. The state of this man, that is, of this posterity of the Most Ancient Church, was one of natural good; and they 
who are in natural good are of such a character that they hide themselves through fear and shame because they are naked: while such as are destitute of natural good do not hide themselves, because they 
are insusceptible of shame; concerning whom, in Jeremiah 8:12-13. (See above, n. 217.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 224</b></p><p><b>224.</b>
Mercy, peace, and all good, which are 'the face of Jehovah', are the cause of the dictate present with people who have perception. They are also the cause, though in a different way, of the dictate present 
with people who have conscience. And they always operate with mercy, but they are received according to the state which the individual is experiencing. The state of this man, that is, of this generation 
of the descendants of the Most Ancient Church, was natural good. And people who are in possession of natural good are of such a nature that they hide out of fear and shame at being naked. But 
people who are not in possession of natural good do not even hide, because they have no sense of shame. These are referred to in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jeremiah%208:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jeremiah 8:12, 13</a>. See what has been said already in <a href="217.htm">217</a>.

</p><b>224.</b>
Misericordia, pax, omne bonum, seu 'facies Jehovae' sunt quae causantur dictamen apud eos qui perceptionem habent; etiam apud eos qui conscientiam, sed cum differentia; et operantur semper misericorditer; 
sed recipiuntur secundum statum in quo homo. Stat hujus hominis seu hujus posteritatis Antiquissimae Ecclesiae erat bonum naturale; et qui in bono naturali, tales sunt ut se occultent ex timore 
et ex pudore quod nudi: qui vero in nullo bono naturali sunt, ne quidem se occultant, quia non pudefiunt; de quibus apud Jeremiam viii 12, 13; videatur prius n. 217.
