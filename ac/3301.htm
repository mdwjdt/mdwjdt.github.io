<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3301节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3301.</strong>“毛衣”表属世人的真理。这从“衣”和“毛”的含义清楚可知：“衣”是指包裹另一事物的某种事物，故在此是指真理，因为它用来包裹良善，真理如同一件衣裳（<a href="1073.htm">1073</a>，<a href="2576.htm">2576</a>节），或几乎可以说，真理就是接受良善的容器（<a href="1469.htm">1469</a>，<a href="1496.htm">1496</a>，<a href="1832.htm">1832</a>，<a href="1900.htm">1900</a>，<a href="2063.htm">2063</a>，<a href="2261.htm">2261</a>，<a href="2269.htm">2269</a>节）；“毛”是指属世人的真理。“毛”或“头发”在圣言中经常被提及，在那里表示属世之物。原因在于，毛发是人最表层的生长物，就像相对于理性和理性内层部分的属世人。在人看来，当他活在肉身时，属世人就是他的全部，但这绝不是真的。属世人是来自其内在部分的生长物，就像毛发来自身体的各个部位一样。这二者以几乎同样的方式从内在部分发出。正因如此，在来世，活在肉身时完全属世之人当照着这种状态呈于眼见时，整张脸几乎完全被毛发覆盖。而且，人的属世人由头发来代表。当这属世人来自良善时，它由仔细梳理的漂亮秀发来代表；但当这属世人并非来自良善时，它由难看的乱发来代表。<br />正是由于这种代表，所以在圣言中，“头发”表属世人，尤表属世人的真理。如撒迦利亚书： <br />到那日，凡作先知说预言的，必因他所论的异象羞愧，不再穿毛衣哄骗人。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚13.4.htm">13:4</a>）<br />“先知”表那些教导真理的人，在此表那些教导虚假的人（<a href="2534.htm">2534</a>节）。“异象”表真理，在此表虚假；“毛衣”表属世人的真理。由于这不是真理，而是虚假，故经上说“哄骗人”。先知穿这样的衣服是为了代表真理，因为真理是外在的。故提斯比人以利亚因穿这样的衣服还被称为“毛人”（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下1.8.htm">1:8</a>）；最后一位先知施洗约翰身穿“骆驼毛的衣服”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太3.4.htm">3:4</a>）。“骆驼”是指属世人中的记忆知识（参看<a href="3048.htm">3048</a>，<a href="3071.htm">3071</a>，<a href="3143.htm">3143</a>，<a href="3145.htm">3145</a>节），而记忆知识是属世人的真理（<a href="3293.htm">3293</a>节）。<br />“头发”表属世人的真理。这从拿细耳人很明显地看出来。拿细耳人被要求在一切许愿离俗的日子，不可用剃头刀剃头，直到离俗归耶和华的日子满了。那时，他们要放下头发，在会幕门口剃离俗的头，把头发放在平安祭下的火上（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民6.5.htm">6:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民6.18.htm">18</a>）。拿细耳人代表主的神性人，并由此代表属天教会的人，属天教会的人是主的样式（<a href="51.htm">51</a>节）；而此人的属世人则由头发来代表。因此，当拿细耳人成圣时，他们要脱去其生来所进入的旧的或以前的属世人，披上一个新人。这一过程由以下条例来表示：当离俗归耶和华的日子满了后，要放下头发，将它放在平安祭下的火上。因为属天之人的状态是这样：他处于良善，并通过良善认识一切真理，从来不通过真理思想和谈论良善，更不会通过记忆知识思想和谈论良善（参看<a href="202.htm">202</a>，<a href="337.htm">337</a>，<a href="2715.htm">2715</a>，<a href="2718.htm">2718</a>，<a href="3246.htm">3246</a>节）。此外，属天之人具有这样的性质：在他们脱去生来所进入的状态之前，其属世人因装备了真理而变得如此强大，以致他们能与地狱争战；因为进行争战的是真理，从来不是良善。地狱甚至无法从最远处接近良善。这就是真理与良善的情形（<a href="1950.htm">1950</a>，<a href="1951.htm">1951</a>节）。<br />由此明显可知，参孙的力量来自他的头发是怎么回事。经上论到他说：<br />耶和华的使者向那妇人显现说，看哪，你必怀孕，生一个儿子，剃头刀都不可上他的头；因为这孩子一出胎就归神作拿细耳人。（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士13.3.htm">13:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/士13.5.htm">5</a>）<br />后来，他向大利拉透露说，若剃了他的头发，他的力气就离开他，他会变得软弱无力。后来，他的头发一被剃除，他的力气就离开了，非利士人便抓住他。再后来，剃头后他的头发又开始渐渐长起来，他的力气就恢复了，于是他便推倒了那房的柱子（士师记16）。谁看不出这些事蕴含天上的奥秘，人若不接受有关代表的教导，就不会知道这奥秘是什么；也就是说，拿细耳人代表属天之人，并且只要有头发，他就代表这属天之人的属世人。如前所述，这属世人具有强而有力的真理。参孙有这样的力气，是因为那时主所吩咐的一切代表都具有这样的力量和效果。但参孙不像上面所提到的那些人一样是一个神圣化的拿细耳人，也就是说，不是具有取代真理的良善状态的某个人。他的力气之所以最终存在于他的头发中，主要是为了他能代表主，主通过属世人的真理与地狱争战并制服它们。主在披上属世人的神性良善与真理之前做这一切的。<br />由此也明显可知，为何要求作大祭司、头上倒了膏油、又承接圣职、穿了圣衣的，不可剃头，也不可撕裂衣服（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利21.10.htm">21:10</a>）。同样，在论述新圣殿的地方，要求祭司利未人不可剃头，也不可容发绺长长（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结44.20.htm">44:20</a>）；也就是说，是为了他们可以代表主的神圣属世人那源于良善、被称为良善真理的真理。“毛发”或“头发”表属世人的真理，这也可从圣言的预言部分明显看出来。如以西结书：<br />我使你生长好像田间所长的，你就渐渐长大，以至极其俊美，两乳成形，头发长成。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.7.htm">16:7</a>）<br />这论述的是耶路撒冷，耶路撒冷在此表古教会；随着时间推移，古教会逐渐败坏了。“两乳成形”表属世良善，“头发长成”表属世真理。<br />但以理书：<br />我观看，有宝座设立，上头坐着亘古常在者。他的衣服洁白如雪，头发如纯净的羊毛，宝座乃火焰。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.9.htm">7:9</a>）<br />启示录：<br />灯台中间有一位好像人子，身穿长衣，直垂到脚，胸间束着金带。他的头与发皆白，如纯羊毛、如雪，眼目如同火焰。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.13.htm">1:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.14.htm">14</a>）<br />“发白如纯羊毛”表神圣属世人的真理。在圣言和犹太教会的仪式中，真理本身由“白”来代表，并且真理因源于良善而被称为“纯羊毛”。之所以“真理”由“白”来代表，良善由“红”来代表，是因为真理类似于光，良善类似于火，是光的源头。<br />和圣言中的其它事物一样，“头发”也具有反面意义，表示属世人歪曲的真理。如以赛亚书：<br />到那日，主必用大河那边赁来的剃头刀，就是亚述王，剃去头发和脚上的毛，并要剃净胡须。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛7.20.htm">7:20</a>）<br />以西结书：<br />人子啊！你要拿一把利剑，给你作剃头刀，用这刀剃你的头发和你的胡须，拿天平称，将须发平分。你要将三分之一在城中用火焚烧，将三分之一在城的四围用刀剑砍碎，将三分之一任风吹散；你要从其中拿出小数来，包在衣襟里；再从这些之中取些扔在火中，在火中焚烧；从里面必有火出来烧入以色列全家。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结5.1.htm">5:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结5.4.htm">4</a>）<br />上述经文通过使用代表，描述了“头发”和“须发”所表示的内层和外层属世真理不复存在。它被“用火焚烧”表示情欲毁了它；“在城的四围用刀剑砍碎”表示推理毁了它；“任风吹散”表示虚假原则毁了它。这段经文与主在马太福音中的教导很相似，即：种子，也就是真理，有的落在荆棘里，有的落在岩石上，有的落在路旁（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.1.htm">13:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.9.htm">9</a>）。<br />“头发”表不洁净的真理和属于属世人的虚假。这一点也由以下条例来代表，即：当与从敌人那里掳来的妇人结婚时，她要被领到家里，剃头发、修指甲，脱去被掳时所穿的衣服（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申21.12.htm">21:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申21.13.htm">13</a>）；还有，当利未人被圣化时，要用除罪水弹在他们身上，又叫他们用剃头刀刮全身，洗衣服，从而洁净自己（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民8.7.htm">8:7</a>）；以及尼布甲尼撒被赶出离开世人，吃草如牛，身被天露滴湿，头发长长，好像鹰毛，指甲长长，如同鸟爪（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但4.33.htm">4:33</a>）。关于大麻风的条例：他们要注意毛发和胡须的颜色，它们是变白、变红、变黄还是变黑；他们还要查看衣服上的物件；长大麻风得洁净的人要把所有的头发、胡须、眉毛都剃了（利未记十三章，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利14.8.htm">14:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利14.9.htm">9</a>），这表示由于亵渎而产生的不洁虚假，也就是内义上的“大麻风”。<br />然而，“光秃”表示丝毫没有真理的属世人。如以赛亚书：<br />他上巴益，又往底本，到高处因尼波去哭泣。摩押人因米底巴哀号，各人头上光秃，胡须剃净。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛15.2.htm">15:2</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />必有光秃代替美发，烙伤代替美容。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛3.24.htm">3:24</a>）<br />对以利沙说“秃头的上去吧，秃头的上去吧”，于是被两只从林中出来的母熊撕成碎片的童子（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下2.23.htm">2:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下2.24.htm">24</a>）代表那些亵渎圣言，声称其中似乎没有真理的人；因为以利沙代表主的圣言（<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>节）。由此明显可知那时代表们具有多么大的权柄。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3301</b></p><p><b>3301.</b>
That a "hairy garment" [tunica] signifies the truth of the natural, is evident from the signification of a "garment" [tunica] as being that which invests something else, and here therefore it signifies 
truth, because this invests good; for truth is as a vesture (n. 1073, 2576); or what is nearly the same, truth is a vessel receiving good (n. 1469, 1496, 1832, 1900, 2063, 2261, 2269); and also from 
the signification of "hairy," as being the natural in respect to truth. "Hair," or the "hair of the head," is frequently mentioned in the Word, and there signifies the natural; the reason is that hair 
is an excrescence in the outermost parts of man, just as is the natural also relatively to his rational and to the interior things thereof. It appears to man, while he lives in the body, that the natural 
is his all, but this is so far from being true that the natural is rather an excrescence from his internals, as hair is from the things of the body. The two also proceed from the internals in almost 
the same way. Hence it is that men who in the life of the body have been merely natural, in the other life, when presented to view in accordance with that state, appear as if covered with hair over 
almost the whole face. Moreover man's natural is represented by the hair of the head; when it is from good, it is represented by becoming and carefully arranged hair; but when not from good, by unbecoming 
and disheveled hair. [2] It is from this representative that in the Word "hair" signifies the natural, especially as to truth; as in Zechariah: </p>
<p>     And it shall come to pass in that day that 
the prophets shall be ashamed, a man by reason of his vision, when he hath prophesied, neither shall they wear a hairy tunic to deceive (Zech. 13:4). "Prophets" denote those who teach truths, here 
those who teach falsities (n. 2534); "vision" denotes truths, here falsities; a "hairy tunic" denotes the natural as to truth; and because there was no truth, but rather falsity, it is said, "to deceive." 
Prophets were clothed with such raiment in order to represent that truth, because it is external. Therefore also Elijah the Tishbite from such clothing is called a "hairy man" (2 Kings 1:8); and 
John, who was the last of the prophets, had "raiment of camel's hair" (Matt. 3:4). (That "camels" are memory-knowledges in the natural man, may be seen above, n. 3048, 3071, 3143, 3145; and also that 
memory-knowledges are the truths of the natural, n. 3293.)  [3] That the "hair of the head" signified the natural as to truth is plainly evident from the Nazirites, to whom it was commanded that during 
all the days of their Naziriteship no razor should pass upon their head, until the days were fulfilled during which they separated themselves to Jehovah, and then they should let down the locks of 
their head, and that then they should shave the head of their Naziriteship at the door of the tent of meeting, and should put the hair upon the fire which was under the eucharistic sacrifice (Num. 6:5, 
18). The Nazirites represented the Lord as to the Divine Human; and thence the man of the celestial church, who is a likeness of the Lord (n. 51); and the natural of this man is represented by the 
hair; and therefore, when the Nazirites were sanctified they were to put off their old or former natural man, into which they were born, and were to put on a new man; which was signified by the command 
that when the days had been fulfilled during which they were to separate themselves to Jehovah, they were to let down the locks of their head, and put them upon the fire under the sacrifice. For the 
state of the celestial man is such that he is in good, and from good knows all truths, and never thinks and speaks from truths about good, still less does he think and speak about good from memory-knowledges 
(see n. 202, 337, 2715, 2718, 3246). Moreover celestial men are such that before they put off that state they are in a natural so strong as to truth that they are able to battle with the hells; 
for it is truth that fights, and never good, as the hells cannot make even a distant approach to good. (That such is the case with truth and good may be seen above, n. 1950, 1951.) [4] From this it 
is evident whence Samson had strength from his hair; concerning whom it is said: </p>
<p>     The angel of Jehovah appeared to the woman saying, Behold thou shalt conceive, and bear a son, and no razor shall 
come upon his head; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb (Judg. 13:3, 5); </p>
<p>and afterwards it is related that he told Delilah that if he should be shaven, his strength would depart 
from him, and he would be rendered weak; and after he had been shaven his strength departed, and the Philistines seized him; and afterwards, when the hair of his head began to grow again after he was 
shaven, his strength returned, so that he pulled down the pillars of the house (Judges 16). Who does not see that in these things there is a heavenly arcanum, which no one knows unless he has been 
instructed concerning representatives; namely, that the Nazirite represents the celestial man, and that so long as he had hair he represented the natural of this man, which as before said is in truth 
thus powerful and strong. And as at that time all representatives that were commanded by the Lord had such force and effect, this was the source of Samson's strength. But Samson was not a sanctified Nazirite 
like those described above, namely, as having put on a state of good instead of truth. The effect of his strength by reason of his hair was principally from his representing the Lord, who from 
the natural man as to truth fought with the hells and subdued them, and this before he put on the Divine good and truth even as to the natural man. [5] From this also it is evident why it was commanded 
that the high priest, upon whose head was poured the oil of anointing, and whose hand was consecrated to put on the garments, should not shave his head, nor rend his clothes (Lev. 21:10); and similarly 
that the priests the Levites (where the new temple is treated of) were not to shave their heads, nor let down their hair (Ezek. 44:20); namely, that they might represent the Lord's Divine natural 
as to the truth which is from good, and which is called the truth of good. That "hair," or a "head of hair" signifies the natural as to truth is evident also from the prophecies of the Word, as in Ezekiel: </p>
<p> 
    I set thee as the bud of the field, whence thou didst grow, and didst grow up into beauties of beauties; the breasts have become firm, and thine hair was grown (Ezek. 16:7); </p>
<p>where Jerusalem 
is treated of, which here signifies the Ancient Church, which in process of time had become perverted. The "breasts become firm" denote natural good; the "hair that was grown," natural truth. [6] 
In Daniel: </p>
<p>     I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of Days did sit. His raiment was white as snow, and the hair of His head like the pure wool; His throne was fiery flames (Dan. 
7:9). And in John: </p>
<p>     In the midst of the lampstands one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about at the paps with a golden girdle. And His head and His 
hair were white as white wool, as snow; and His eyes were as a flame of fire (Rev. 1:13-14); </p>
<p>"hair white like pure wool" denotes the Divine natural as to truth. In the Word, and in the rituals of the 
Jewish Church, truth itself was represented by white, which being from good, is called "pure wool." The reason why the representation of truth is by white, and the representation of good by red, is 
that truth is of light, and good is of the fire from which the light proceeds. [7] Like other expressions in the Word, "hair" has also an opposite sense, and signifies the natural as to truth perverted, 
as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     In that day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, in the passages of the river, with the King of Assyria, the head and the hair of the feet; and it shall also consume 
the beard (Isa. 7:20). In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Son of man, take thee a sharp sword, a barber's razor shalt thou take unto thee, and shalt cause it to pass upon thine head, and upon thy beard; and take thee 
balances to weigh, and divide the hairs. A third part shalt thou burn with fire in the midst of the city; thou shalt take a third part and smite with the sword round about the city; and a third part 
thou shalt scatter to the wind; and thou shalt take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts; and of these again shalt thou take, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them 
in the fire; therefrom shall a fire come forth unto all the house of Israel (Ezek. 5:1-4). In this manner it is representatively described that there is no longer any interior and exterior natural truth, 
which is signified by the "hair" and the "beard." That lusts have destroyed it is signified by its being "burned with fire"; that reasonings have destroyed it is signified by "smiting with the sword 
round about the city"; that false principles have destroyed it, is signified by "scattering it to the wind." The meaning of this passage is similar to what the Lord teaches in Matthew, that of the 
seed, which is truth, some fell among thorns, some on the rock, and some upon the way (Matt. 13:1-9). [8] That the "hair of the head" signifies the unclean truths and falsities which are of the natural 
man, was represented also by the command that when a woman that had been taken captive from the enemy was to be married, she was to be brought into the house, the hair of her head was to be shaved, 
her nails were to be pared, and the raiment of her captivity was to be put off (Deut. 21:12-13); also that when the Levites were consecrated, the water of expiation was to be sprinkled upon them, they 
were to cause a razor to pass over all their flesh, and their clothes were to be washed, and thus they were to be cleansed (Num. 8:7); and also that Nebuchadnezzar was driven out from men to eat grass 
like oxen, and his body to be wet with the dew of heaven, until his hair grew like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws (Dan. 4:33). That in leprosy the colors of the hair and beard 
were to be observed, as to whether they were white, reddish, yellow, black, and also those of the garments; and that he who was cleansed from leprosy should shave off all the hair of the head, beard, 
and eyebrows (Lev. 13, 14:8-9), signified unclean falsities from what is profane, which in the internal sense is "leprosy." [9] "Baldness" however signified the natural in which there was nothing of 
truth, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     He is gone up to Bayith, and to Dibon, to the high places, to weep over Nebo, and Moab shall howl over Medeba; on all their heads is baldness, every beard is shaved (Isa. 15:2). In 
the same: </p>
<p>     It shall come to pass that instead of braided work there shall be baldness, and branding instead of beauty (Isa. 3:24).  That the children who said to Elisha, "Go up, thou bald-head; 
go up, thou bald-head," were torn in pieces by bears from the wood (2 Kings 2:23-24) represented those who blaspheme the Word, speaking as if there were no truth in it; for Elisha represented 
the Lord as to the Word (n. 2762). From this it is now manifest how much power there was at that time in representatives. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3301</b></p><p><b>3301.</b>
'A hairy garment' means the truth of the natural. This is clear from the meaning of 'a tunic' as something that clothes another thing - that something being in this case truth because this serves to 
clothe good (for truth is like a garment, <a href="1073.htm">1073</a>, <a href="2576.htm">2576</a>, or what amounts almost to the same, truth is the recipient vessel for good, <a href="1469.htm">1469</a>, <a href="1496.htm">1496</a>, <a href="1832.htm">1832</a>, <a href="1900.htm">1900</a>, <a href="2063.htm">2063</a>, <a href="2261.htm">2261</a>, <a href="2269.htm">2269</a>); and also from the meaning of 
'hairy' as the natural as regards truth. Hair, or the hair on the head, is mentioned several times in the Word, and in those places means that which is natural, the reason being that hairs are outgrowths 
on the most exterior parts of a person, as also is the natural in relation to its rational and to the interior parts of the rational. During his lifetime it seems to everyone as though the natural 
within him is all there is to him, but this is so far from being true, that the natural is rather an outgrowth from the internal parts of him, like hairs from the parts of the body. They also stem 
from internal parts in almost the same way. This also is why people who have been wholly natural during their lifetime are seen in the next life to have faces covered almost entirely with hair when a 
visual presentation is made of that state. What is more, man's natural is represented by 'the hair'. When it is an outgrowth from good it is represented by attractive and neatly arranged hair, but when 
it is not the outgrowth from good by unattractive and dishevelled hair. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It is from this representation that in the Word 'hair', or 'the hair on the head' is used to mean the natural, especially 
as regards truth, as in Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
It will happen on that day, that the prophets will be ashamed, [every] man on account of his vision when he has prophesied. And he will not put on a hairy garment 
in order to deceive. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%2013:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 13:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The prophets' stands for people who teach truths, here for those who teach falsities, <a href="2534.htm">2534</a>. 'Vision' stands for truths, here for falsities, 'hairy garment' for 
the natural as regards truth. But because it was not truth but falsity the phrase 'in order to deceive' is used. Such clothing was worn by the prophets so that truth, being external, might be represented 
by them. This also was why, dressed in a similar way, Elijah the Tishbite is called a hairy man, <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 1:8, and why John, the last of the prophets, had a garment of camel hair, Matt. 3:4 - 'camels' 
being facts in the natural man, see <a href="3048.htm">3048</a>, <a href="3071.htm">3071</a>, <a href="3143.htm">3143</a>, <a href="3145.htm">3145</a>, and facts being the truths of the natural man, <a href="3293.htm">3293</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That 'the hair' meant the natural as regards truth is quite clear from the 
Nazirites who were commanded not to shave their heads with a razor all the days of their Nazirite vow, not until their days of abstinence to Jehovah had been completed. Then they were to let down the 
hair on their heads and at the door of the Tent of Meeting were to shave the head of their Naziriteship and put the hair on to the fire which was beneath the eucharistic sacrifice, Num. 6:5, <a href="18.htm">18</a>, <a href="19.htm">19</a>. They 
represented the Lord's Divine Human, and from this the person belonging to the celestial Church, who was a likeness of the Lord, <a href="51.htm">51</a> - representing that person's natural man by 'the hair'. When they 
were being sanctified therefore they were to lay aside their old or previous natural man into which they had been born and were to assume the new. This was meant by the requirement, when the days of 
abstinence to Jehovah had been completed, to let down the hair on their heads and to put it on to the fire beneath the sacrifice. For the state of the celestial man is a state in which good is present 
in him and from that good he has a knowledge of all truths. He never thinks and talks from truths about good, still less from facts about good, see <a href="202.htm">202</a>, <a href="337.htm">337</a>, <a href="2715.htm">2715</a>, <a href="2718.htm">2718</a>, <a href="3246.htm">3246</a>. Furthermore those who 
are celestial are of such a nature that before they lay aside that state into which they were born their natural has become so powerfully equipped with truth that they are capable of fighting with the 
hells; for it is truth, never good, that goes into battle. The hells cannot make even the remotest approach towards good. That truth is of such a nature, and good of such a nature, see <a href="1950.htm">1950</a>, <a href="1951.htm">1951</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
From this it is evident how it was that Samson had strength from his hair, referred to as follows, </p>
<p>The angel of Jehovah appeared to Samson's mother, saying, Behold, you will conceive and bear 
a son. And no razor shall come up over his head; the boy shall be a Nazirite of God from the womb. Judg. 13:3, <a href="5.htm">5</a>. </p>
<p>Later on he revealed to Delilah that if he were shaved his strength would leave him 
and he would be rendered powerless. And immediately he had been shaved, his strength did leave him and the Philistines seized him. And when subsequently the hair on his head started to grow again, where 
he had been shaved, his strength returned to him, enabling him to dislodge the pillars of the house, Judg. 16:1-end. Who does not see that this description holds a heavenly arcanum within it, and 
that nobody knows what that arcanum is unless he has been taught regarding representatives, that is to say, that a Nazirite portrayed the celestial man, and as long as he had his hair he portrayed the 
natural part of that man, with whom, as has been stated, such strong and powerful truth was present? And Samson had such strength because at that period of time all representatives which the Lord had 
commanded had such force and effect. But he was not a consecrated Nazirite like those mentioned above, that is to say, someone who had put on a state of good instead of truth. The chief reason why the 
ultimate existence of his strength lay in his hair was so that he might represent the Lord who from the natural man as regards truth was to fight the hells and overcome them. This He did before putting 
on Divine Good and Truth even as regards the natural man. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 From this it is also evident why the high priest, on whose head the anointing oil had been poured and who had been consecrated<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> to 
wear the garments, was commanded not to shave his head or to rend his garments, Lev. 21:10. And in a similar way where the new Temple is referred to the Levitical priests were commanded not to shave their 
head or to let their hair grow long, Ezek. 44:20; that is to say, they represented the Lord's Divine Natural as regards truth that is derived from good and is called truth grounded in good. That 
'hair' or the hair on the head means the natural as regards truth is clear also from the prophetical parts of the Word, as in Ezekiel, </p>
<p>I gave you to be like the seed of the field, from which you grew 
up and became tall to full beauty; your breasts were formed and your hair had grown. Ezek. 16:7. </p>
<p>This refers to Jerusalem, which is the Ancient Church here and which in process of time became perverted. 
'Breasts were formed' stands for natural good, 'hair which has grown' for natural truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In Daniel, </p>
<p>I saw, until thrones were placed, and the Ancient of Days was seated. His clothing 
was white as snow, and the hair of His head like pure wool. His throne was a flame of fire. Dan. 7:9. </p>
<p>And in John, </p>
<p>In the midst of the seven lampstands one like the Son of Man, clothed with a 
long robe and surrounded by a golden girdle around the breasts. His head however and hair were white, like white wool, like snow; but His eyes were like a flame of fire. Rev. 1:13, <a href="14.htm">14</a>. </p>
<p>'Hair white 
like pure wool' stands for the Divine Natural as regards truth. In the Word, and in the religious observances of the Jewish Church, truth itself was represented by 'white', and because truth is derived 
from good is called 'pure wool'. The reason why truth was represented by 'white' and good by 'red' was that truth is akin to light and good to fire, the source of the light. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 As with everything 
else in the Word 'the hair' also has a contrary sense and means the natural as regards truth when perverted, as in Isaiah, </p>
<p>On that day the Lord will shave by means of a razor hired at the crossing-places 
of the River - by means of the King of Asshur - the head and the hair of the feet; and it will consume the beard also. Isa. 7:20. </p>
<p>In Ezekiel, </p>
<p>Son of man, take for yourself a sharp sword, 
use it as a barber's razor which you shall run over your head and over your beard. Then you are to take balances and you are to divide it. A third you are to burn with fire in the midst of the city; 
a third you are to strike with the sword round about it; and a third you are to scatter to the wind. You shall take from it a small number, and bind it in your skirts. Finally you are to take from these 
again and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them with fire, and from this, fire will come forth to the whole house of Israel. Ezek. 5:1-4. </p>
<p>All this, by the use of representatives, 
describes how natural truth, interior and exterior, meant by 'the hair' and 'the beard', ceased to exist any longer. Its destruction by lusts is meant by its being burned with fire, by reasonings by its 
being struck with the sword round about the city, by false assumptions by its being scattered to the wind. These statements are similar in content to what the Lord teaches in Matthew about some seed, 
which is the truth, falling among thorns, some on stony ground, and some along the path, Matt. 13:1-9. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 That 'the heir' means the unclean truths and the falsities belonging to the natural man 
was also represented by the requirement that when a woman from among enemies who had been taken captive was to be married to [an Israelite], she was to be brought to his home, the hair on her head was 
to be shaved off, her nails were to be pared, and the garments of her captivity were to be removed, Deut. 21:12, <a href="13.htm">13</a>. Also when Levites were consecrated, the water of expiation was to be sprinkled over 
them, they were to pass a razor over their entire flesh, and to wash their clothes, and so be pure, Num. 8:7. Also, Nebuchadnezzar was driven from among men so that he ate grass like oxen, and his 
body was wet from the dew of heaven, till his hair grew to be like eagles' feathers and his nails like birds' claws, Dan. 4:33. In the case of leprosy they were required to note the colours of hair and 
beard, whether these were white, reddening, yellow, or black. They were to look for the same in garments. And the person who was cleansed from leprosy was required to shave all the hair on his head, 
his beard, and his eyebrows, Lev. 13:1-end; 14:8, <a href="9.htm">9</a>. The latter meant the unclean falsities that result from unholiness, which is leprosy in the internal sense. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 'Baldness' however meant the natural 
when no truth at all is present in it, as in Isaiah, </p>
<p>He is going up to Bayith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep over Nebo; and Moab will howl over Medeba. On all their heads is baldness; 
every beard is shaved off. Isa. 15:2. </p>
<p>In the same prophet, Instead of well-set hair there will be baldness, branding instead of beauty. Isa. 3:24 </p>
<p>The children who said to Elisha, Go up, you baldhead! 
Go up, you baldhead! and who were torn apart by the bears out of the forest, <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 2:23, <a href="24.htm">24</a>, represent people who blaspheme the Word as though it had no truth within it; for Elisha represented 
the Lord as regards the Word, <a href="2762.htm">2762</a>. From this it is also evident how prevalent representatives were at that period of time.

Quod `tunica pilosa' significet verum naturalis, constat ex significatione `tunicae' quod sit tale quod aliud investit, hic ideo verum quia hoc investit bonum, est enim verum sicut vestis {1}, n. 1073, 
2576, seu quod paene idem est, est veram vas recipiens boni, n. 1469, 1496, 1832, 1900, 2063, 2261, 2269; tum a significatione `pilosae' quod sit naturale quoad verum: `pilus' seu crinis aliquoties 
in Verbo memoratur, et ibi significat naturale; causa est quia pili sunt excrescentiae in ultimis hominis, sicut quoque naturale est respective ad ejus rationale et ad hujus interiora; apparet homini 
cum vivit in corpore, quod naturale sit in illo omne, sed hoc tantum abest a vero ut naturale potius sit excrescentia ab internis ejus, sicut sunt pili ab illis quae sunt corporis; etiam ab internis 
paene similiter procedunt; quare etiam homines qui in vita corporis mere naturales fuerunt, in altera vita, cum sistuntur videndi secundum statum illum, apparent quoad paene omnem faciem criniti; et praeterea 
naturale hominis repraesentatur per `crines'; cum ex bono est, per crines decoros et concinne positos; cum autem non ex bono, per crines indecoros et inordinatos; [2] ex repraesentativo hoc est 
quod pili seu crines in Verbo significent naturale, imprimis quoad verum; ut apud Zachariam,           Fiet in die illo, pudefient prophetae, vir propter      visionem suam, cum prophetaverit, et 
non induent tunicam      pilosam ut mentiantur, xiii 4; </p>
<p>`prophetae' pro illis qui docent vera, hic qui falsa, n. 2534; `visio' pro veris, hic pro falsis, `tunica pilosa' pro naturali quoad verum, et 
quia non verum erat sed falsum, dicitur `ut mentiantur'; induebantur talibus prophetae ut illud verum, quia externum, repraesentarent: ideo quoque Elias Tishbita ex amictu tali dicitur `vir pilosus,' 
2 Reg. i 8: et Johannes qui prophetarum ultimus, habebat `vestimentum ex pilis camelinis,' Matth. iii 4; quod `cameli' sint scientifica in naturali homine, videatur n. 3048, 3071, 3143, 3145; [3] et 
quod scientifica sint naturalis hominis vera, n. 3293. Quod `crinis' significaverit naturale quoad verum, constat manifeste a naziraeis, quibus mandatum           Quod omnibus diebus naziraeatus eorum, 
novacula non      transiret super caput eorum, usque dum impleti fuissent dies      quibus se abstinerent Jehovae,...et tunc demitterent comam      capitis sui,...et (t)quod tunc ad ostium tentorii 
conventus      caput naziraeatus sui tonderent, et crinem tunc darent super      ignem qui sub sacrificio eucharistico, Num. vi 5, 18, 19; </p>
<p>repraesentabant illi Dominum quoad Divinum Humanum, ac 
inde {2}caelestis Ecclesiae hominem, qui similitudo Domini, n. 51, et naturale illius hominis {3}per crinem; quare cum sanctificarentur, naturalem suum hominem veterem seu priorem, in quem nati {4}erant, 
exuerent ac novum induerent; quod significatam est per quod `cum impleti essent dies quibus se abstinerent Jehovae, demitterent comam capiti sui, et darent super ignem sub sacrificio'; status enim 
caelestis homini est {5}, quod in bono sit et ex bono sciat omnia vera, (c)et nusquam e: veris de bono, minus ex scientificis de bono, cogitet et loquatur videatur n. 202, (x)337, 2715, 2718, 3246; 
praeterea {6}caelestes homine sunt tales quod antequam exuunt illum statum, in naturali tam forti quoad verum sint ut pugnare possint cum infernis, nam verum est quod pugnat, nusquam bonum; ad bonum 
inferna (t)ne quidem e longinquo accedere possunt; quod verum tale sit, et bonum tale, videatur n. 1950, 1951. [4] Inde patet unde robur Simsoni ex crine, de quo ita,           Apparuit angelus Jehovae 
matri Simsonis, dicens, Ecce      concipies et paries filium, et novacula non ascendet super      caput ejus, erit naziraeus Dei puer ab utero, Jud. xiii 3, 5; </p>
<p>          Dein quod indicaverit Delilae 
quod si raderetur,      recederet ab illo robur ejus, et redderetur infirmus; et tunc      cum rasus fuit, quod recesserit robur, et comprehenderint      illum Philistaei: et postea cum incepit 
capillus capitis ejus      crescere, sicut abrasus fuit, quod redierit robur, ut columnas      domus emoveret, Jud. xvi 1 ad fin.; </p>
<p>quis non videt quod in his caeleste arcanum sit, et quod id nemo 
sciat nisi qui instructus est de repraesentativis, quod nempe naziraeus {7}referret caelestem hominem, et quamdiu crinis illi, referret naturale illius hominis, qui in tam potenti et forti vero est, 
ut dictum; et quia tunc temporis omnia repraesentativa quae a Domino mandata fuerunt, talem vim et effectum haberent, inde Simsoni robur; sed is non naziraeus sanctificatus fuit quales illi de quibus 
supra, nempe quod induerit statum boni loco veri: effectus roboris ejus propter crines erat inde principaliter quod repraesentaret Dominum, Qui ex naturali homine quoad verum pugnaret cum infernis et 
ea subjugaret, et hoc antequam indueret Divinum Bonum et Verum etiam quoad naturalem hominem. [5] (m)Inde quoque {8}patet cur mandatum quod           Sacerdos magnus, super cujus caput est effusum oleum  
    unctiones, et impleta manus ad induendum vestes, caput suum      non raderet, et vestes suas non dissueret, Lev. xxi 10; </p>
<p>et similiter sacerdotes Levitae, ubi de novo Templo agitur, quod  
         Caput suum non raderent, et comam suam non demitterent,      Ezech. xlix 20; </p>
<p>ut nempe repraesentarent Divinum Naturale Domini quoad {9}verum quod ex bono, et vocatur boni verum.(n) Quod `pilus' 
seu crinis significet naturale quoad verum, etiam ex propheticis Verbi constat, ut apud Ezechielem,           Sicut germen agri dedi te, unde crevisti et      adolevisti...in decora decorum, ubera 
solidata sunt, et crinis      tuus crevit, (x)xvi 7; </p>
<p>ubi de Hierosolyma, quae ibi Antiqua Ecclesia, quae temporis tracti perversa facta; `ubera solidata' pro bono naturali, `crinis qui crevit' 
pro vero naturali: [6] apud Danielem,           Videns fui usque dum throni projecti sunt, et antiquus      dierum sedit, vestis ejus sicut nix alba, et crinis capitis      ejus sicut lana munda; thronus 
ejus {10}sicut flamma ignis,      vii 9: </p>
<p>et apud Johannem,           In medio septem candelabrorum, similis Filio hominis      indutus talari, et circumcinctus ad ubera zona aurea, caput  
    autem et capilli albi, sicut lana alba, sicut nix, sed oculi      ejus sicut flamma ignis, Apoc. i 13, 14; </p>
<p>`capilli albi sicut lana munda' pro Divino Naturali quoad verum ipsum verum in Verbo, ac 
in ritualibus Ecclesiae Judaicae, repraesentatum fuit per `album,' quod quia a bono, dicitur {11}`lana munda' quod {12}veri repraesentatio sit per `album,' et {13}boni per `rubrum,' erat quia verum 
est lucis, et bonum est ignis ex quo lux. [7] Crinis, sicut reliqua in Verbo, etiam oppositum sensum habet, et significat naturale quoad verum perversum; ut apud Esaiam,           In die illo detondebit 
Dominus per novaculam mercenariam      in transitibus fluvii per regem Asshuris, caput, et pilos      pedis et etiam barbam consumet, vii 20 {14}: </p>
<p>apud Ezechielem,           Fili hominis, sume 
tibi gladium acutum, novaculam      tonsoriam accipias tibi, quam traduces super caput tuum, et      super barbam tuam; dein accipias tibi lances ponderis, et      dividas illa; tertiam igne comburas 
in medio urbis;...tertiam      percutias gladio circum eam; et tertiam dispergas in      ventum;...accipies de illo parum numero, et liges eam in alis      tuis; tandem de illis iterum accipias 
et projicias ea in      medium ignis, et comburas ea igne, ex quo exibit ignis ad      totam domum Israelis, v 1-4; </p>
<p>(s)ita repraesentative describitur quod nullum amplius esset verum naturale interius 
et exterius, quod est `crinis et barba'; quod concupiscentiae illud destruxerint, significatur per quod `combureretur igne'; quod ratiocinia, per quod `gladio percuteretur circumcirca'; quod falsa 
principia, per quod `dispergeretur in ventum'; haec simile involvunt ac illa quae Dominus docet apud Matthaeum,           Quod semen, quod est verum, aliud ceciderit inter spinas,      aliud in petram, 
et aliud super viam, xiii 1-9. [8] Quod `crines' significent vera immunda et falsa quae naturalis hominis, etiam repraesentatum est per quod, (s)           Femina quae maritanda ex captivis hostium, 
ducenda esset      in domum, abradendi capilli capitis ejus, praecidendi ungues,      removendae vestes captivitatis ejus, Deut. xxi 12, 13: </p>
<p>tum quod, cum consecrarentur Levitae,           
Spargeretur super eos aqua expiationis, transire facerent      novaculam super omnem carnem eorum, et lavarentur vestes, et      sic puri essent, Num. viii 7: </p>
<p>et quoque,           Quod Nebuchadnezzar 
ab homine expulsis sit, ut herbam      sicut boves comederet, et a rore caelorum corpus ejus      tingeretur usque dum crinis ejus sicut aquilarum cresceret, et      ungues ejus sicut avium, Dan. 
lv 30.           Quod in lepra observarentur colores pili et barbae, ut      albus, rubescens, flavus, niger; etiam in vestibus; et quod      `mundatus a lepra abraderet omnem pilum capitis, barbae,  
    palpebrarum', Lev. xiii 1 ad fin.; xiv 8, 9; </p>
<p>significabat falsa immunda ex prophano, quod {15}est lepra in sensu interno. [9] `Calvities' autem significabat naturale in quo nihil veri, ut 
apud Esaiam,           Ascendit Bajith, et Dibon, excelsa ad fletum super Nebo,      et super Medeba Moabus ejulabit, in omnibus capitibus ejus      calvities, omnis barba rasa, xv 2: </p>
<p>apud eundem,  
         Erit loco operis implexi calvities,...adustio loco      pulchritudinis, iii 24. (s)Quod pueri qui dixerunt Elisaeo, Ascende calve, ascende calve, discerpti sint ab ursis e silva, 2 Reg. 
ii 23, 24, repraesentabat illos qui blasphemant Verbum, sicut quod inibi non verum; `Elisaeus' enim repraesentabat Dominum quoad Verbum, n. 2762; inde quoque patet quantum tunc temporis valuerunt repraesentativa.
