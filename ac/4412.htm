<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4412节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4412.</strong>有一个人活在肉身期间我是认识的，但我不了解他的性格和内在情感。在来世，他与我交谈过几次，但时间不长且在远处。他通常以愉悦的代表显示他自己，因为他能制造各种令人愉悦的事物，如各种颜色和色彩美丽的形式；能展现打扮得像天使一样漂亮的小孩子，以及许多令人愉悦和快乐的类似事物。他通过一种进入眼膜的温和而轻柔的流注这样做，藉着这类代表进入别人的情感，其目的是给他们的生命带来乐趣和快乐。天使告诉我，属于眼膜的人就具有这种个性，他们与花园般的天堂相联，在那里，真理与良善就表现为属灵物质所形成的物体，如前所述（<a href="4411.htm">4411</a>节）。</p>

There was a certain person whom I had known in the bodily life, but whom I had not known in respect to his animus and interior affections. He spoke with me several times in the other life, but for a 
while at a distance. He usually showed himself by means of pleasant representatives, for he could present things which excited delight, such as colors of every kind and beautiful colored forms, could 
exhibit infants beautifully decorated like angels, and very many similar things that were pleasant and delightful. He operated by a gentle and soft influx into the coat of the left eye. By such means 
he instilled himself into the affections of others, with the end to please and delight their life. I was told by the angels that they who belong to the coats of the eye are of such a character, and that 
they communicate with the paradisal heavens, where truths and goods are represented in a substantial form, as stated above (n. 4411). </p>

There was a certain person whom I had known during his lifetime, though not so far as his disposition and interior affections were concerned. He spoke to me several times in the next life, but for a 
short while from a distance. Ordinarily he revealed himself by means of lovely representatives, for he was able to produce the kinds of things that gave pleasure, such as colours of every kind and beautiful 
coloured forms; to bring on the scene young children beautifully adorned like angels, and very many other representatives similar to these which were lovely and delightful. He did it by means of 
a mild and gentle influx into the tunic of the left eye. By means of such representatives he entered into the affections of others, his end in view being to bring pleasure and delight into their life. 
I was told by the angels that this is the character of those who belong to the tunics of the eye and that they communicate with the paradise-like heavens where truths and goods are represented in objects 
formed from spiritual substance, as stated above in <a href="4411.htm">4411</a>. </p>

{1} Erat quidam in vita corporis mihi notus, sed non quoad animum et affectiones interiores; is mecum in altera vita aliquoties locutus {2}, sed paulisper e longinquo; is se communiter manifestabat 
per repraesentativa amoena, potuit enim sistere talia quae delectabant, sicut omnis generis colores et coloratas formas pulchras, introducere infantes pulchre decoratos sicut angelos, et perplura 
similia quae amoena et jucunda essent; agebat per influxum lenem et mollem, et hoc in oculi sinistri tunicam; per talia insinuabat se in affectiones {3} aliorum, fine beneplacendi et jucundandi vitam 
illorum: dictum mihi ab angelis quod tales sint qui ad tunicas oculi pertinent, et quod communicent {4} cum caelis paradisiacis, ubi in forma substantiali repraesentantur vera et bona, ut supra 
n. 4411 {5} dictum.      @1 In A this [ ] follows 4413 but both are renumbered as here and directions given for their transposition.$      @2 loquutus, et aliquoties postea$      @3 affectionibus$
