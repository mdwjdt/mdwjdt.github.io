<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6600节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6600.</strong>我被清楚指示，一个人的思维，以及灵人和天使的思维会辐射到灵界的众多社群；但在辐射的方式上，这个人的思维却不同于另一个人的。为叫我确切地知道这一切，我被允许与我的思维所渗透到的一些社群交谈，由此得以知道流入我思维的东西，知道它来自哪个社群，以及这个社群在哪里，是何性质，并且是以一种我不可能弄错的方式知道的。世人、灵人和天使所拥有的理解和觉知的能力就取决于他的思维和情感向不同社群的延伸。<br />处于仁与信之良善的人拥有进入天堂社群的延伸，其思维和情感延伸得何等充分，则取决于这些良善，以及真正的良善与他同住的程度；因为所有这些良善都与天堂一致，因而广泛地自动流入它。然而，有些社群会有对真理的情感渗透进来，有些社群则有对良善的情感渗透进来。对真理的情感渗透到属灵天使的社群，而对良善的情感则渗透到属天天使的社群。但另一方面，那些陷入邪恶和虚假之人的思维和情感则延伸至地狱社群，其延伸的程度取决于邪恶和虚假与他同住的程度。<br />前面说过，世人、灵人和天使的思维辐射到周围的社群，理解和觉知由此产生。不过，要知道，这话是照着表象来说的，因为思维和情感的流注并不是进入这些社群，而是来自这些社群，事实上，经由与人同在的天使和灵人而来自这些社群。因为如前面各章末尾所说明的，一切流注皆来自更内在之物；因此，在善人当中，它是从天堂，也就是经由天堂从主而来的流注；在恶人当中，它是从地狱而来的流注。</p>

I have been clearly shown that man's thought, and also that of spirits and of angels, pours itself around into many societies in the spiritual world, but the thought of one person in a different way 
from the thought of another. In order that I might know this for certain, I have been allowed to speak with some societies to which my thought had penetrated, and from this I was given to know what flowed 
into the thought, from what society it came, and also where and of what quality the society was, so that I could not be mistaken. The capacity of understanding and perceiving in man, spirit, and 
angel is in accordance with the extension of his thoughts and affections into the societies. [2] He who is in the good of charity and of faith has extension into the societies of heaven, ample according 
to the degree in which he is in them, and in which he is in genuine good; for these things are in agreement with heaven, and therefore flow in there spontaneously and widely. Yet there are some societies 
into which the affection of truth, and others into which the affection of good, penetrates. The affection of truth penetrates to the societies of the spiritual angels, but the affection of good 
to the societies of the celestial angels. But on the other hand the thought and affection of those who are in evil and falsity have extension into infernal societies, and this also according to the 
degree of evil and falsity with them. [3] It is said that the thought and affection of man, spirit, and angel pour themselves around into the societies, and that from this come the understanding and 
perception; but be it known that it is so said according to the appearance, for there is no influx of the thoughts and affections into the societies; but from the societies, and this through the angels 
and spirits with the man. For as has been shown at the end of preceding chapters, all influx comes from what is more interior; thus with the good from heaven (that is, through heaven from the Lord), 
and with the evil from hell. </p>

I have been shown quite plainly that a person's thought, also that of spirits, and of angels too, radiates into numerous communities in the spiritual world, but that the thought of one person does so 
in a different manner from that of another. So that I might have sure knowledge of this I have been allowed to talk to some of the communities to which my own thought has penetrated. And from this I 
have been able to know what was flowing into my thought and which community it came from as well as the location and the essential nature of that community, and to know all this in such a way that I could 
not be mistaken. The extension of the thoughts and affections of man, spirit, or angel into different communities is what determines how much ability he has to understand and perceive. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 How 
amply the thoughts and affections of a person in whom the good of charity and of faith are present extend into the communities of heaven depends on the degree to which those forms of good, and also genuine 
good resides with him; for all these kinds of good are in harmony with heaven and therefore flow spontaneously far and wide into it. There are nevertheless some communities into which an affection 
for truth, and others into which an affection for good reaches. An affection for truth reaches communities consisting of spiritual angels, and an affection for good reaches communities consisting 
of celestial angels. But on the other hand the thought and affection of those who are under the influence of evil and falsity extend into hellish communities; how far they extend likewise depends on the 
degree to which evil and falsity reside with them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 It has been stated that the thought and affection of man, spirit, and angel radiate into communities round about, and that understanding and 
perception arise from this. But it should be recognized that this was a statement only of what seems to happen, since no inflow of thoughts and affections takes place into those communities, only from 
them, and indeed by Way of the angels and spirits present with a person. For as has been shown at the ends of previous chapters, all influx takes place from what is more internal; thus among the good 
it is an influx from heaven, that is, from the Lord by way of heaven, and among the evil it is an influx from hell. </p>

</p><b>6600.</b>
Manifeste ostensum est mihi quod cogitatio hominis, et quoque spirituum, ut et angelorum, se circumfundat in plures societates in mundo spirituali, sed unius cogitatio diversimode quam alterius; ut 
id pro certo scirem, datum est loqui cum quibusdam societatibus, ad (x)quas pervasit mea cogitatio, ac inde {1}datum scire quod in cogitationem influebat, e qua societate illud, {2}tum ubinam esset, et 
qualis, sic ut falli non potuerim. Secundum extensionem cogitationum et affectionum in societates fit facultas intelligendi et percipiendi apud hominem, spiritum, et angelum.  [2]Qui in bono {3}charitatis 
et fidei est, is extensionem habet in societates caeli amplam secundum gradum quo in illis est et quo in genuino bono, concordant enim illa cum caelo, quapropter influunt illuc sua sponte (c)et 
late:  sunt usque societates aliae in quas pervadit affectio veri, et aliae in quas affectio boni; affectio veri pervadit ad societates angelorum spiritualium, at affectio boni ad societates angelorum 
caelestium.  Vicissim autem, cogitatio et affectio illorum qui in malo et falso sunt, illae extensionem habent in societates infernales, et hoc quoque secundum gradum mali et falsi apud illos.  [3]Dicitur 
quod cogitatio et affectio hominis, spiritus et angeli se circumfundant in societates, et quod inde intellectus et perceptio; sed sciendum est quod secundum apparentiam ita dictum sit, non enim 
est influxus cogitationum et affectionum in societates, sed a societatibus, et quidem per angelos et spiritus apud hominem; nam, ut ad finem (x)praecedentium capitum ostensum est, omnis influxus {4}fit 
ab interiore, ita apud bonos e caelo, hoc est, per caelum a Domino, et apud malos est influxus ab inferno. @1 dein$ @2 qualis esset et ubinam$ @3 fidei et in charitate erga proximum$ @4 est ab extra$ </p>
