<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1461节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1461.</strong>“亚伯兰就下埃及去，要寄居在那里”表在认知方面来自圣言的教导。这从“埃及”和“寄居”的含义清楚可知。稍后就会看到，“埃及”表由认知构成的知识，“寄居”表接受教导。主在孩童时和其他人一样接受教导。这从前面（<a href="1457.htm">1457</a>节）解读第9节时所引证的路加福音中的经文清楚可知，也从刚才有关外在人的论述可知，即外在人只能藉着认知被作成，以便与内在人对应、一致。外在人居于肉体和感官，不接受任何属天或属灵之物，除非认知被植入其中，如植入土壤中。属天之物能使用这些认知，如同使用接纳自己的容器。不过，这些认知必须来自圣言。来自圣言的认知具有这样的性质：它们通过主自己开放。因为圣言本身经由天堂来自主，主的生命就在圣言的每一个细节中，尽管这在外在形式上看不出来。由此可见，除了圣言的认知外，主在孩童时不愿吸收任何其它认知。就象刚才说的，圣言通过耶和华自己、祂的父向祂开放，祂要与父合而为一。这种愿望甚至更强烈，因为圣言中出现的所有话，就其至内在而言，没有一句不与祂相关，并且没有一句不首先出自祂。祂的人性本质纯粹是其自永恒就存在的神性本质的添加物。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1461.</strong> The fact that and Abram went down into Egypt to reside as an immigrant means being taught concepts from the Word can be seen from the symbolism of Egypt and of residing as an immigrant. The symbolism of Egypt as the knowledge of those concepts, and the symbolism of residing as an immigrant as being taught, comes directly below.<br />The passages in Luke quoted at the last verse (verse 9, 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1461/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1457" target=_top>1457</a>) make it clear that while he was young, the Lord was taught like any other person. So do the remarks directly above concerning the outer self, which cannot be reduced into correspondence and agreement with the inner self except through knowledge. One's outer self is body-centered and sense-oriented and cannot absorb anything heavenly or spiritual unless, like soil, it has seeds of knowledge planted in it. In those seeds of knowledge, heavenly influences can find their receiving vessels. The knowledge, however, has to be from the Word. Knowledge from the Word is such that it offers access to the Lord himself. The Word itself, after all, comes from the Lord by way of heaven and in each and every detail contains life from the Lord, despite appearances to the contrary in its outward aspect. From this you can see that when he was young, the Lord did not want to be indoctrinated with any other kind of knowledge but knowledge of the Word, which, again, gave him open access to his Father, Jehovah himself, with whom he was to unite and become one. He had all the more reason for his reluctance in the fact that the Word says nothing that does not have to do with him at its deepest levels and that did not first come from him. (His human nature was only an addition to his divine nature, which has existed from eternity.) </p>

And Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn. That this signifies instruction in knowledges [cognitiones] from the Word is evident from the signification of "Egypt," and from the signification of "sojourning." 
That "Egypt" signifies the memory-knowledge of knowledges, and that "to sojourn" signifies to be instructed, will be seen presently. That in His childhood the Lord was instructed as are other 
men, is evident from the passages in Luke that were adduced in the explication of verse 9 (n. 1457); and also from what has been said just above concerning the external man, which cannot be reduced to 
correspondence and agreement with the internal except by means of knowledges. The external man is corporeal and sensuous; nor does it receive anything celestial and spiritual unless knowledges are implanted 
in it, as in ground; for in these celestial things can have their recipient vessels. But the knowledges must be from the Word. Knowledges from the Word are such that they are open from the Lord 
Himself; for the Word itself is from the Lord through heaven, and the Lord's life is in all things of the Word, both in general and in particular, although it does not so appear in the external form. 
Hence it may be seen that in His childhood the Lord did not will to imbue Himself with any other knowledges than those of the Word, which was open to Him, as before said, from Jehovah Himself, His Father, 
with whom He was to be united and become One; and this the more, because nothing is said in the Word that does not in its inmosts have regard to Him, and that has not first come from Him; for the 
Human Essence was only a something that was added to His Divine Essence that was from eternity. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1461</b></p><p><b>1461.</b>
'And Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn' means instruction in cognitions from the Word. This is clear from the meaning of 'Egypt' and from the meaning of 'sojourning'. That 'Egypt' means knowledge 
comprised of cognitions, and 'sojourning' receiving instruction, will be seen in what follows shortly. That the Lord received instruction in childhood as anybody else does is clear from those places 
in Luke quoted previously at verse 9 in <a href="1457.htm">1457</a>, and also from what has been stated just above concerning the external man, who cannot possibly be made to correspond and accord with the internal man except 
by means of cognitions. The external man is seated in the body and the senses, and does not receive anything celestial or spiritual unless cognitions are implanted in it as in the soil. Celestial things 
are able to utilize these as their own recipient vessels, but those cognitions must be from the Word Cognitions from the Word are such as lie open from the Lord Himself, for the Word itself comes 
from the Lord by way of heaven, and the Lord's life is present in every single detail of it, though this is not to be seen in the external form. From this it may become clear that in childhood the Lord 
wished to take in no other cognitions than those of the Word, which, as stated, was laid open to Him from Jehovah Himself, His Father, with whom He was to be united and become one. And that wish was 
even stronger for the reason that no statement occurs in the Word that does not inmostly have regard to Him and does not in the first place come from Him. For His Human Essence was purely an addition 
to His Divine Essence which existed from eternity. </p>

</p><b>1461.</b>
'Et descendit Abram in Aegyptum ad peregrinandum':  quod significet instructionem in cognitionibus ex Verbo, constat ex significatione 'Aegypti' et ex significatione 'peregrinari'; quod Aegyptus significet 
scientiam cognitionum, et peregrinari instrui, videbitur in mox sequentibus.  Quod Dominus sicut alius homo instructus fuerit in pueritia, constat ab illis apud Lucam quae ad vers. praec. 9, n. 
1457, adducta, tum ab illis quae dicta mox supra de externo homine, qui non aliter cum interno homine ad correspondentiam et concordantiam redigi potest quam per cognitiones; externus homo est corporeus 
et sensualis, nec aliquid caeleste et spirituale recipit nisi ei sicut humo implantentur cognitiones; caelestia in his sua recipientia vasa possunt habere; sed cognitiones erunt ex Verbo; cognitiones 
ex Verbo tales sunt ut pateant ab Ipso Domino; ipsum enim Verbum est ex Domino per caelum, inque ejus omnibus et singulis est vita Domini, tametsi non ita in externa forma apparet; inde constare 
potest quod Dominus in pueritia non alias cognitiones voluerit imbuere quam Verbi, quod patens Ipsi fuit, ut dictum, ab Ipso Jehovah Patre Ipsius, cum Quo uniretur ac unus fieret; et eo magis quia nihil 
in Verbo dictum, quod non Ipsum in intimis spectet, et quod non ab Ipso prius venit; Humana enim Essentia fuit modo additamentum ad Ipsius Divinam, Quae fuit ab aeterno. </p>
