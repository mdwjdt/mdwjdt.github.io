<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第399节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>399.</strong>创世记4:17 该隐与妻子同房，他妻子就怀孕，生了以诺。该隐建造了一座城，就按着他儿子的名，将那城叫作以诺。<br />“该隐与妻子同房，他妻子就怀孕，生了以诺”，这句话表示这样的分裂或异端自己又产生另一个，被称为“以诺”；“该隐建造的一座城”表由此产生的一切教义和异端，并且因为这分裂或异端被称为“以诺”，所以经上说“就按着他儿子的名，将那城叫作以诺”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]399.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_399/bible_king-james-version_genesis_4_17" target=_top>Genesis 4:17</a>. And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and delivered Enoch. And [Cain] was building a city, and he named the city after his son, Enoch.<br />Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and delivered Enoch, means that this schism or heresy spontaneously produced another called "Enoch." The city that was built symbolizes every doctrinal or heretical teaching spawned by it. As the schism or heresy was called "Enoch," it says that the city was named after his son, Enoch. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 399</b></p><p><b>399.</b>
Verse 17. And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and bare Enoch; and he was building a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch. The words "Cain knew his wife, and she 
conceived and bare Enoch" signify that this schism or heresy produced another from itself that was called "Enoch." By "the city which he built" is signified all that was doctrinal and heretical therefrom, 
and because the schism or heresy was called "Enoch" it is said that "the name of the city was called after the name of his son, Enoch." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 399</b></p><p><b>399.</b>
Verse 17 And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he was building a city, and he called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch.  </p>
<p>'Cain knew his wife, and she conceived 
and bore Enoch' means that this schism or heresy produced another from itself which was called 'Enoch'. 'A city that was built' means every detail of doctrine and heresy arising out of it. It is 
because that schism or heresy was called Enoch that the statement is made about the name of the city being called after the name of his son Enoch.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 399</b>
</p><b>399.</b>
Vers. 17.  Et cognovit Cain uxorem suam, et concepit, et peperit Hanoch; et fuit aedificans urbem, et vocavit nomen urbis secundum nomen filii sui Hanoch. 'Quod Cain cognoverit uxorem suam, conceperit 
et pepererit Hanochum' significat quod schisma hoc, seu haeresis, aliam ex se produxerit, quae vocata est Hanoch: per 'urbem aedificatam' significatur omne doctrinale et haereticum inde: quia schisma 
seu haeresis vocata est Hanoch, dicitur quod 'nomen urbis vocatum sit secundum nomen filii Hanoch.' </p>
