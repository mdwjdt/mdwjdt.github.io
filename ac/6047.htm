<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6047节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6047.</strong>“等法老召你们的时候”表如果教会的记忆知识所在的属世层想与你们联结。这从给自己“召”的含义和“法老”的代表清楚可知：给自己“召”是指想要联结，因为出于情感召他们来住在他的地上，与他的臣民一起成为一个民族，就是想与他们联结；“法老”是指教会的记忆知识所在的属世层，如前所述（<a href="6042.htm">6042</a>节）。法老召他们表示对引入和联结所作出的回应，也就是说，教会的记忆知识与属世层中的真理并良善的联结。因为一切联结或结合都必须是相互的，因而双方都同意。<br />此处论述的主题是教会的真理与其记忆知识的联结，但有必要知道它们将以哪种方式联结。联结必不从记忆知识开始，然后通过这些知识进入信之真理，因为人的记忆知识来自感官印象，因而来自世界，即无数幻觉或谬误的源头。联结必须以这种方式从信之真理开始：首先要了解教会的教义，然后通过圣言查看这些教义是不是真理。事实上，它们之所以是真的，不是因为它们是教会领袖如此宣称，并且其追随者如此维护的东西。若是这样的话，人们就会说，所有教会和宗教的教义之所以是真理，仅仅因为它们是一个人的本土教义，是他生来所持守的。因此，不仅天主教徒，或贵格会教徒的教义是真的，就连犹太人，甚至伊斯兰教徒的教义也是真的，因为他们的教会领袖就是如此宣称的，他们的追随者也是如此维护的。由此明显可知，人必须查寻圣言，在那里查看教会所教导的是不是真的。当出于对真理的情感查寻时，人就会从主领受光明，被主启示，以至于在不知道其启示之源头的情况下察觉何为真理，并照着他处于良善的程度而确信它。不过，如果他所查明的这些真理与教会的教义不相符，就要让他当心不要在教会制造混乱。<br />一旦他已确认，并如此通过圣言肯定教会的教义是信之真理，就可以通过他所拥有的一切记忆知识，无论其名称或性质如何，来证实它们。因为这时，他对真理的态度是完全肯定的，所以接纳与它们一致的记忆知识，弃绝由于包含在它们里面的谬误而不一致的记忆知识。事实上，信仰通过记忆知识来巩固、强化；因此，没有人被禁止出于对了解他所生在其中的教会的教义是否真实的情感来查寻圣经；因为他无法以其它方式被启示。如此行之后，也没有人被禁止通过记忆知识来增强他的信仰；但在此之前，让他不要如此行。这就是信之真理与记忆知识联结的方式，也是唯一的方式；不仅教会的记忆知识是这样，而且其它任何记忆知识也是这样。然而，如今极少有人以这种方式进行；因为阅读圣言的绝大多数人不是出于对真理的情感，而是出于对确认他们所生在其中的教会之教义的情感而阅读圣言，无论这些教义是什么样。<br />圣言有一段对主国度的描述，在该国度，属灵的领域、理性的领域和记忆知识的领域都被联结在一起；不过，这一段是以表示这些领域的名字来描述的，即“以色列”、“亚述”和“埃及”。在以赛亚书的这些话中，“以色列”描述了属灵领域，“亚述”描述了理性领域，“埃及”描述了记忆知识领域：<br />在那日，在埃及地中间必有为耶和华筑的一座坛；在埃及的边界上必有为耶和华立的一根柱。这都要在埃及地为万军之耶和华作记号和证据。埃及人因为受人的欺压哀求耶和华，祂就差遣一位救主、一位首领给他们，他必拯救他们。耶和华就被埃及所认识，在那日，埃及人要认识耶和华，也要献牲祭和素祭敬拜祂，并向耶和华许愿还愿。在那日，必有从埃及通往亚述的大道。亚述要进入埃及，埃及也要进入亚述，埃及要事奉亚述。在那日，以色列必与埃及、亚述三国一律，成为地中的祝福；万军之耶和华要赐福说，埃及我的百姓，亚述我手的工作，以色列我的产业，都有福了！（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.19.htm">19:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.25.htm">25</a>）.<br />谁都能看出，此处不是指埃及这个国家，也不是指亚述，甚至不是指以色列；相反，它们当中的每一个都表示某种其它事物。“以色列”表示教会的属灵领域（参看<a href="3654.htm">3654</a>，<a href="5801.htm">5801</a>，<a href="5803.htm">5803</a>，<a href="5806.htm">5806</a>，<a href="5812.htm">5812</a>，<a href="5817.htm">5817</a>，<a href="5819.htm">5819</a>，<a href="5826.htm">5826</a>，<a href="5833.htm">5833</a>节）；“亚述”表示理性领域（<a href="119.htm">119</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>节）；“埃及”表示记忆知识领域（<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>，<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>，<a href="4749.htm">4749</a>，<a href="4964.htm">4964</a>，<a href="4966.htm">4966</a>，<a href="5700.htm">5700</a>，<a href="6004.htm">6004</a>，<a href="6015.htm">6015</a>节）。这三者在教会成员里面被联结在一起，这一点在先知书中以这些话来描述：“必有从埃及通往亚述的大道。亚述要进入埃及，埃及也要进入亚述，埃及要事奉亚述。在那日，以色列必与埃及、亚述三国一律，成为地中的祝福”。因为要成为教会的一员，人必须成为一个属灵人，以及一个理性人，而记忆知识要为这些人服务。由此明显可知，记忆知识无论如何都不可被信之真理弃绝，而是要与它们联结；不过，人要走第一条路，就是从信开始的路，不可走第二条路，就是从记忆知识开始的路。也可参看前面所述（<a href="128.htm">128</a>-<a href="130.htm">130</a>，<a href="195.htm">195</a>，<a href="196.htm">196</a>，<a href="232.htm">232</a>，<a href="233.htm">233</a>，<a href="1226.htm">1226</a>，<a href="1911.htm">1911</a>，<a href="2568.htm">2568</a>，<a href="2588.htm">2588</a>，<a href="4156.htm">4156</a>，<a href="4760.htm">4760</a>，<a href="5510.htm">5510</a>，<a href="5700.htm">5700</a>节）。</p>

And it may be that Pharaoh will call you. That this signifies, if the natural in which are the memory-knowledges of the church wills to be conjoined, is evident from the signification of "to call to 
himself," as being to will to be conjoined; for to call to himself from the affection that they should dwell in his land and become one nation with his own, is to will to be conjoined; and from the representation 
of Pharaoh, as being the natural in which are the memory-knowledges of the church (as above, n. 6042). By Pharaoh's calling is signified what is reciprocal of initiation and conjunction, 
namely, of the memory-knowledges of the church with truths and goods in the natural; for all conjunction needs reciprocity, whereby there is consent on both sides. [2] The conjunction of the truths of 
the church with its memory-knowledges is here treated of, but it is necessary to know in what manner they are to be conjoined. For indeed the start must not be made from memory-knowledges, and through 
these an entrance be made into the truths of faith, because the memory-knowledges with a man are derived from things of sense, thus from the world, from which spring innumerable fallacies. But the 
start must be made from truths of faith, in this way. First there must be learned the doctrinal things of the church, and then the Word must be examined to see whether these are true; for they are not 
true because the heads of the church have said so and their followers confirm it, because in this way the doctrinal things of all churches and religions would have to be called true, merely because they 
exist in the country, and men hold them from their birth; and in this wise not only would the doctrinal things of Papists and also of Quakers be true, but also those of Jews and even of Mohammedans, 
because their leaders have said so and their followers confirm it. This shows that the Word must be searched, and there it must be seen whether the doctrinal things are true. When this is done from 
the affection of truth, then the man is enlightened by the Lord so as to perceive, without knowing whence, what is true; and he is confirmed therein in accordance with the good in which he is. If these 
truths disagree with the doctrinal things, let him take heed not to disturb the church. [3] Afterward, when he has been confirmed, and is thus in the affirmative from the Word that the doctrinal things 
are truths of faith, it is then allowable for him to confirm them by all the memory-knowledges he possesses, of whatsoever name and nature; for then, because what is affirmative reigns universally, 
he accepts the memory-knowledges which agree, and rejects those which by reason of the fallacies they contain disagree; for faith is strengthened by means of memory-knowledges; and therefore no one 
is forbidden to search the Scriptures from the affection of knowing whether the doctrinal things of the church within which he was born, are true; for in no other way can he be enlightened. After doing 
this no one is forbidden to fortify himself by means of memory-knowledges; but he may not do so before. This is the way and the only way of conjoining the truths of faith with memory-knowledges; not 
only with the memory-knowledges of the church, but also with any memory-knowledges whatever. Yet very few at this day proceed in this way; for most persons who read the Word do not read it from the 
affection of truth, but from the affection of confirming therefrom the doctrinal things of the church within which they were born, no matter what these may be. [4] In the Word there is described the 
Lord's kingdom, in that the spiritual, the rational, and memory-knowledge are therein conjoined together; but this is described by names which signify these; namely, by "Israel," "Assyria," and "Egypt." 
By "Israel" is described the spiritual, by "Assyria" the rational, and by "Egypt" memory-knowledge, in these words of Isaiah: </p>
<p>     In that day there shall be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the 
land of Egypt, and a pillar near the border thereof to Jehovah. And it shall be for a sign and for a witness thereof to Jehovah Zebaoth in the land of Egypt; for they shall cry unto Jehovah because 
of the oppressors, and He shall send them a savior, and a prince, and he shall deliver them. And Jehovah shall become known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know Jehovah in that day, and shall offer 
sacrifice and meat offering, and shall vow a vow to Jehovah, and shall perform it. In that day there shall be a path from Egypt unto Assyria, and Assyria shall come into Egypt, and Egypt into Assyria, 
and Egypt shall serve Assyria. In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the land; which Jehovah Zebaoth shall bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt My 
people, and Assyria the work of My hands, and Israel Mine inheritance (Isa. 19:19-25). [5] Everyone can see that Egypt is not meant here, nor Assyria, nor yet Israel, but something else by each of them. 
(That by "Israel" is meant the spiritual of the church, has already been shown, n. 3654, 5801, 5803, 5806, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826, 5833; and by "Assyria," the rational, n. 119, 1186; and by "Egypt," 
memory-knowledges, n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462, 4749, 4964, 4966, 5700, 6004, 6015.) These three conjoined together in the man of the church are described in the prophet by the words, "there shall be 
a path from Egypt to Assyria, and Assyria shall come into Egypt, and Egypt into Assyria, and Egypt shall serve Assyria; in that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing in 
the midst of the land." For in order that a man may be a man of the church, it is necessary for him to be spiritual, and also rational, with memory-knowledge subservient to these. From all this it is 
now evident that memory-knowledge is by no means to be rejected from the truths of faith, but that it is to be conjoined with them; but by the prior way, that is, by the way from faith; and not by the 
posterior way, that is, by the way from memory-knowledges. (See also what has been already shown, n. 128-130, 195, 196, 232, 233, 1226, 1911, 2568, 2588, 4156, 4760, 5510, 5700.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6047</b></p><p><b>6047.</b>
'And it may be, that Pharaoh may call you' means if the natural in which the Church's factual knowledge resides wishes to be joined to you. This is clear from the meaning of 'calling to oneself' as wishing 
to be joined to, for the call to them, made with affection, to live in his land and become a single nation together with his subjects is the expression of a wish to be joined to them; and from 
the representation of 'Pharaoh' as the natural in which the Church's factual knowledge resides, as above in <a href="6042.htm">6042</a>. Pharaoh's call to them means the response made to the introduction and joining together, 
that is to say, the joining of the Church's factual knowledge to truths and forms of good in the natural. For every joining together requires such a response and therefore agreement on both sides. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
The subject here is the joining together of the Church's truths and its factual knowledge; but one needs to know in what way they should become joined. The joining together must not start with 
factual knowledge which is then used to look into the truths of faith; for a person's factual knowledge comes from sensory impressions, thus from the world, the source of countless illusions. It must 
start with the truths of faith; that is to say, one should proceed in the following way. First of all one should get to know what the Church teaches; then one should discover from the Word whether such 
teaching is the truth. For things are true not because they are what leaders of the Church have so declared and their followers uphold. If that were so one would have to say that the teachings of any 
Church or religion were the truth simply because they are those of a person's native soil and are those into which he was born. Thus not only the teachings of Papists or Quakers would be true but also 
those of Jews and of Mohammedans too since their Church leaders have so declared and their followers uphold it. From all this it is evident that one should search the Word and there see whether what 
the Church teaches is the truth. When an affection for truth motivates the search a person receives light from the Lord so that he may discern, though unaware of the source of his enlightenment, what 
the truth is and may be assured of it in the measure that he is governed by good. But if the truths discerned by him are at variance with the teachings of the Church, let him beware of creating a disturbance 
in the Church.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Once he has become assured and so affirms from the Word that the Church's teachings are truths of faith, let him then employ any fact he knows, whatever the name or nature 
of it, to corroborate them. For now that he is thoroughly affirmative in his attitude towards the truth he welcomes facts that accord with them and casts away those which because of the misconceptions 
present within them do not accord. The facts are used in support of his faith. No one therefore should be forbidden to search the Scriptures if motivated by a desire to know whether the teachings 
of the Church in which he was born are true; for in no other way can he ever become enlightened. Nor should he be forbidden after that to use factual knowledge to support his beliefs; but let him not 
do so before that. This and no other is the way in which the truths of faith should be joined to factual knowledge - not only the facts known to the Church but also any other kinds of facts. But very 
few at the present day proceed in this way, for the majority of people who read the Word are not motivated by a desire for truth when they read it but by a desire to endorse the teachings of the Church 
in which they were born, no matter what those teachings may be like. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The Word contains a description of the Lord's kingdom in which the spiritual domain, the domain of reason, and the domain 
of factual knowledge exist joined together; but in that description names that serve to mean those domains are used - Israel, Asshur, and Egypt. 'Israel' describes the spiritual domain, 'Asshur' the 
domain of reason, and 'Egypt' that of factual knowledge, in the following words in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
On that day there will be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to Jehovah 
at its border; and it will be for a sign and a witness to Jehovah Zebaoth in the land of Egypt, for they will cry out to Jehovah because of the oppressors, and He will send a saviour and prince to them, 
and he will deliver them. And Jehovah will make Himself known to Egypt, and the Egyptians will know Jehovah on that day and will offer sacrifice and minchah, and will make a vow to Jehovah and perform 
it. On that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Asshur, and Asshur will come into Egypt, and Egypt into Asshur, and Egypt will serve Asshur.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> On that day Israel will be the third with Egypt 
and Asshur, a blessing in the midst of the earth, whom Jehovah Zebaoth will bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt My people, and Asshur the work of My hands, and Israel My heritage. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2019:18-25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 19:18-25</a>.

<p><b>[5]</b>
 Anyone 
may see that in this quotation the country Egypt is not meant, or Asshur, or even Israel, but that some other thing is meant by each of them. 'Israel' is used to mean the spiritual domain of the 
Church, see <a href="3654.htm">3654</a>, <a href="5801.htm">5801</a>, <a href="5803.htm">5803</a>, <a href="5806.htm">5806</a>, <a href="5812.htm">5812</a>, <a href="5817.htm">5817</a>, <a href="5819.htm">5819</a>, <a href="5826.htm">5826</a>, <a href="5837.htm">5837</a>; 'Asshur' to mean the domain of reason, <a href="119.htm">119</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>; and 'Egypt' to mean the domain of factual knowledge, <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>, <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>, <a href="4749.htm">4749</a>, <a href="4964.htm">4964</a>, <a href="4966.htm">4966</a>, <a href="5700.htm">5700</a>, <a href="6004.htm">6004</a>, <a href="6015.htm">6015</a>. The existence of the three joined together in the member of the Church is described in the prophet by the words 'there will be a highway from Egypt to Asshur, and Asshur 
will come into Egypt, and Egypt into Asshur, and Egypt will serve Asshur. On that day Israel will be the third with Egypt and Asshur, a blessing in the midst of the earth'. For to be a member of the Church 
a person must of necessity be a spiritual person, and also a rational one whom factual knowledge will serve. From all this it may now be evident that factual knowledge should not on any account 
be cast aside from the truths of faith but should be joined to them. But one should go the primary way, that is, the way that begins with faith, not the secondary way, that is, the one that begins with 
factual knowledge.
