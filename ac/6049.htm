<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6049节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6049.</strong>“你们要说，你的仆人，从幼年直到如今，都是养牲畜的人”表引向良善的真理从开始就存在，现在仍存在。这从“养牲畜的人”和“从幼年直到如今”的含义清楚可知：“养牲畜的人”是指引向良善的真理（参看<a href="6016.htm">6016</a>，<a href="6045.htm">6045</a>节）；“从幼年直到如今”是指从开始到现在为止。关于“牲畜”表示引向良善的真理，要知道，“牲畜”包括所有大大小小的役畜，既包括羊群和牛群，也包括骆驼、马、骡子和驴。后者表示与真理有关的事物，而前者（即羊群的羊和牛群的牛）则表示与良善有关的事物。这就是为何被称为“牲畜”的所有这些役畜一般表示引向良善的真理。在原文，“牲畜”一词源自一个还表示“货财”（acquisition）的词，“货财”在灵义上也表示引向良善的真理，因为良善通过真理获得。但“小牲畜”表示内层良善，因为它们都是羊群里的，如羔羊、绵羊、小山羊、母山羊和公羊。<br />在圣言的其它经文中，“牲畜”表示引向良善的真理，如以赛亚书：<br />你将种子撒在地里，主必降雨给你的种，并使粮食增多，肥美丰盛。到那日，你的牲畜必在宽阔的草场吃草。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.23.htm">30:23</a>）<br />“吃草”表示在真理和良善上接受教导（<a href="5201.htm">5201</a>节）；而“宽阔的草场”表示真理的教义；经上之所以用“宽阔”这个词，是因为“宽”表示真理（<a href="3433.htm">3433</a>，<a href="3434.htm">3434</a>，<a href="4482.htm">4482</a>节）。由此明显可知，“牲畜”表示引向良善的真理。以西结书：<br />我要使你反手攻击那从前荒凉、现在有人居住之地，又攻击那住世界中间，从列族招聚、得了牲畜财货、住在地上脐心的人民。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结38.11.htm">38:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结38.12.htm">12</a>）<br />“牲畜”以同样的方式表示引向良善的真理，“财货”表示良善。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6049</b></p><p><b>6049.</b>
And ye shall say, Thy servants have been men of cattle from their youth even until now. That this signifies that from the beginning and as yet they have truths from which is good, is evident from the 
signification of "men of cattle," as being truths from which is good (see n. 6016, 6045); and from the signification of "from their youth even until now," as being from the beginning and as yet. In regard 
to "cattle" signifying truths from which is good, be it known that "cattle" are all beasts of burden greater and less, in both the flock and the herd, and also camels, horses, mules, and asses. 
These latter beasts of burden signify such things as relate to truths; but the former, namely, those of the herd and the flock, signify such things as relate to good. Therefore it is that all those beasts 
of burden in general which are "cattle" signify truths from which is good. The term "cattle" in the original tongue is from a word which also means "acquisition," and "acquisition" in the spiritual 
sense is also truth from which is good, for the reason that good is acquired by means of truth. But "small cattle" signify interior goods, for these are of the flock, such as lambs, sheep, kids, goats, 
and rams. "Cattle" also signify truths from which is good in other passages of the Word, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Then shall He give the rain of thy seed, wherewith thou shalt sow the land; and the bread 
of increase; and it shall be fat and rich: in that day shall thy cattle pasture in a broad meadow (Isa. 30:23); </p>
<p>"to pasture" denotes to be instructed in truths and about goods (n. 5201); a "broad 
meadow" denotes the doctrine of truth; it is called "broad" because "breadth" is truth (n. 3433, 3434, 4482). Thus it is plain that "cattle" are truths from which is good. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     To bring 
back thine hand upon the wastes that are inhabited, and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations, working with cattle and possession, that dwell upon the navel of the earth (Ezek. 38:12); </p>
<p>where 
in like manner "cattle" denote truths through which is good; and "possession" denotes good. </p>

'And you are to say, Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our boyhoods and right up to now' means that the truths which lead to good have been present from the beginning and are present 
still. This is clear from the meaning of 'keepers of livestock' as truths that lead to good, dealt with in <a href="6016.htm">6016</a>, <a href="6045.htm">6045</a>; and from the meaning of 'from our boyhoods and right up to now' as from the beginning 
and remaining so still. Regarding the meaning of 'livestock' as truths that lead to good, it should be recognized that livestock includes all draught animals, large and small - both those in the 
flock and those in the herd, and in addition camels, horses, mules, and asses. The latter mean things connected with truths, whereas the former - members of the herd and of the flock - mean things connected 
with good. This then is why all these draught-animals in general, which are 'livestock', mean truths that lead to good. In the original language 'livestock' is derived from a word which also means 
acquisition, and 'acquisition' in the spiritual sense also means truth that leads to good, for the reason that good is acquired by means of truth. But the smaller animals mean interior forms of good 
since they are members of the flock, such as lambs, sheep, kids, she-goats, and rams. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 'Livestock' also means truths that lead to good in other places in the Word, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Then He will 
give rain for your seed with which you will sow the land, and bread the produce [of the land]; and there will be fatness and wealthiness. On that day they will feed your livestock in a broad grassland. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2030:23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 30:23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Feeding' stands for receiving instruction in truths and forms of good, <a href="5201.htm">5201</a>, while 'a broad grassland' stands for the doctrine of truth, the expression 'broad' being used because 
'breadth' means truth, <a href="3433.htm">3433</a>, <a href="3434.htm">3434</a>, <a href="4482.htm">4482</a>. From this it is evident that 'livestock' means truths that lead to good. In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
To bring back your hand upon the inhabited waste places and upon the people 
that were gathered out of the nations, that are working with livestock and a possession - dwellers upon the navel of the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2038:11,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 38:11, 12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Livestock' in a similar way stands for truths 
leading to good, 'a possession 'for good. </p>

`Et dicatis, Viri pecoris fuerunt servi tui a pueritiis suis et usque (x)ad nunc':  quod significet quod vera ex quibus bonum illis a principio et adhuc, constat ex significatione `virorum pecoris' 
quod sint vera ex quibus bonum, de qua n. 6016, 6045; et a significatione `a pueritiis suis et usque ad nunc' quod sit a principio et adhuc.  Quod `pecora' sint vera ea quibus bonum, sciendum quod pecora 
sint omnia jumenta majora et minora, tam {1} quae in grege, quam quae in armento, {2}sunt, (c)ac praeterea cameli, equi, muli, asini; haec jumenta significant talia quae se referunt ad vera, illa 
autem, nempe armenti et gregis {3}talia quae se referunt ad bonum; inde nunc est quod omnia illa jumenta in genere, quae sunt `pecora', significent vera ex quibus bonum; (m)pecora in lingua originali 
sunt ex voce quae etiam significat acquisitionem, et `acquisitio' in sensu spirituali etiam est verum ex quo bonum, ex causa quia bonum acquiritur per verum;(n) [2]`pecudes' autem significant bona interiora, 
{4}illae enim sunt gregis, ut agni,(t)oves, haedi, caprae, arietes.  `Pecora' etiam significant vera ex quibus bonum, etiam aliis in locis in Verbo:  ut apud Esaiam, 	Tunc dabit pluviam seminis 
tui, quo conseres terram, et  panem proventus; et erit pingue et opulentum; pascent pecora  tua in die illo prato lato, xxx 23; </p>
<p>`pascere' pro instrui in veris et de bonis, n. 5201; `pratum latum' 
pro doctrina veri {5}, latum dicitur quia `latitudo' est verum, n. 3433, 3434, 4482; inde patet quod `pecora' sint vera ex quibus bonum: apud Ezechielem, 	Ad reducendum manum tuam super vastitates habitatas, 
et super populum collectum ex gentibus, operantem pecoribus et  possessioni; habitantes super umbilico terrae, xxxviii 11, 12; </p>
<p>`pecora' similiter pro veris {6}per quae bonum, {7}`possessio' 
pro bono'.   @1 i scilicet$ @2 after grege$ @3 significant bona$ @4 haec$ @5 i et boni$ @6 ex quibus$ @7 nam populus collectus ex gentibus sunt vera residua$ </p>
