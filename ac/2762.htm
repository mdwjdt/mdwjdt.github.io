<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2762.</strong>“马”表心智的理解力部分，这一原义唯源于来世的代表物。在灵人界经常会看到马，并且多种多样，还能看到骑马的人。每当看到它们时，它们均表理解力。这类代表物不断出现在灵人当中。正因为马是理解力的代表物，故当马在圣言中被提及时，与人同在的灵人和天使立刻就知道所论述的是理解力。也正因如此，当来自某个其它星球的灵人被赋予聪明智慧，从灵人界被提升到天堂时，那马就会显现，并且闪闪发光，仿佛全身着了火。这些人被提升时，我也曾见过这样的景象。<br />我由此明白以利亚乘旋风升天时，以利沙所看到的火车火马，以及以利沙当时的呼叫分别表示什么：<br />我父啊！我父啊！以色列的战车马兵啊！（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下2.11.htm">2:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下2.12.htm">12</a>）<br />当以利沙快要死亡时，以色列王约阿施对以利沙也说了同样的话：<br />我父啊！我父啊！以色列的战车马兵啊！（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下13.14.htm">13:14</a>）<br />蒙主怜悯，我们将在别处说明以利亚和以利沙代表主的圣言。也就是说，我们将在别处说明，“火车”表示取自圣言的爱与仁的教义，“火马”表示源于这些的信之教义。信之教义就是对圣言内在内容，也就是其内义的理解或理解力。在天上，马车和马会在灵人和天使当中被看到，这一点不仅从众先知，如撒迦利亚（1:8-10；6:3-7），以及其他人看到马的事实明显看出来，还可通过以利沙的仆人明显看出来：<br />耶和华开了以利沙的少年人的眼目，他便能看见；见满山有火车火马围绕以利沙。（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下6.17.htm">6:17</a>）<br />此外，在灵人界，凡有聪明智慧的地方，马车与马就不断显现。原因在于，如前所述，马车和马代表属智慧聪明的事物。人死后苏醒，进入来世时，会看到呈现给他们的是：一个年轻人骑在马上，然后从马上下来。这表示在进入天堂之前，他们必须在真理与良善的认知方面接受教导（参看第一卷，<a href="187.htm">187</a>-<a href="188.htm">188</a>节）。<br />马车和马表示这些事物，这在古教会是众所周知的。这一事实从约伯记也能明显看出来，约伯记就是古教会的书，里面有这些话：<br />神使他忘却了智慧，也未将聪明赐给他；他几时将自己举升高处，就嗤笑马和骑马的人。（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯39.17.htm">39:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯39.19.htm">19</a>）<br />“马”表理解力这层含义从古教会传到周边地区的智者那里，甚至传到希腊。由于这个原因，当描述太阳（太阳表爱，<a href="2441.htm">2441</a>，<a href="2495.htm">2495</a>节）时，他们将其智慧聪明之神置于这太阳当中，并且赋予他一辆战车和四匹火马。当描述海之神时，由于海表总的知识（<a href="28.htm">28</a>，<a href="2120.htm">2120</a>节），所以他们也将马赋予了他。当描述知识因理解力或悟性而急剧增长时，他们用一匹飞马来描绘，其蹄踏出灵感泉，文艺女神就住在那里。特洛伊木马无非表示其理解力为摧毁城墙而发明的装置。直到现在，当描述理解力时，人们仍延续从这些古人传下来的习俗，常常将理解力描述为飞马或珀伽索斯，将学问描绘为泉源。然而，几乎没人知道，就神秘意义而言，“马”表示理解力，“泉源”表示真理，更不知道这些具有灵义的形像是从古教会传到外邦人那里的。</p>

That a "horse" signifies the faculty of understanding is from no other source than the representatives in the other life. Often there, in the world of spirits, horses are seen, and this with great variety, 
and those also that sit on them; and whenever they are seen they signify the faculty of understanding. There are such representatives continually with spirits. It is from the representation of 
the horse, as being the understanding, that when horses are mentioned in the Word, the spirits and angels with man at once know that the understanding is what is treated of. It is also from this that 
when spirits from a certain distant world on being imbued with intelligence and wisdom are taken up from the world of spirits into heaven, there appear to them horses shining as with fire; which also 
I have seen when they were taken up.  [2] From this I could see what is signified by the chariot of fire and horses of fire seen by Elisha when Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven; as also what 
is signified by the exclamation of Elisha then: "My Father, my Father, the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof" (2 Kings 2:11, 12); and by Joash king of Israel saying the same to Elisha when he 
was dying: "My Father, my Father, the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof" (2 Kings 13:14). That by Elijah and Elisha was represented the Lord as to the Word, will of the Lord's Divine mercy 
be told elsewhere; the doctrine of love and charity from the Word being meant by the "chariot of fire," and the doctrine of faith therefrom by the "horses of fire." The doctrine of faith is the same as 
the understanding of the Word as to its interiors, or as to its internal sense.  [3] That chariots and horses are seen in the heavens with spirits and angels, is evident from the fact of their being 
seen by the prophets, as by Zechariah (chapter 1:8-10; 6:3-7), and by others, and also by Elisha's servant, as thus described in the book of Kings: </p>
<p>     Jehovah opened the eyes of Elisha's boy, and 
he saw; and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha (2 Kings 6:17). Moreover, where the abode of the intelligent and wise is, in the world of spirits, chariots 
and horses appear continually; for the reason as said that by chariots and horses are represented the things of wisdom and of intelligence. Resuscitated persons after death, who are entering into the 
other life, see represented to them a young man sitting upon a horse, and then alighting from the horse; and by this is signified that they are to be instructed in the knowledge of good and truth before 
they can come into heaven (see volume 1, n. 187-188).  [4] That chariots and horses signified these things, was well known in the Ancient Church, as also is evident from the book of Job, which is 
a book of that Church, where are these words: </p>
<p>     God hath made her to forget wisdom, and hath not imparted to her intelligence; what time she lifteth up herself on high she scorneth the horse and 
his rider (Job 39:17-19). From the Ancient Church the signification of the horse, as being the faculty of understanding, was extended to the wise round about, even into Greece. From this it came to pass 
that when they described the sun (by which was signified love, n. 2441, 2495), they placed in it the god of their wisdom and intelligence, and gave him a chariot and four horses of fire; and that 
when they described the god of the sea, because by the sea were signified knowledges in general (n. 28, 2120), they gave horses also to him; and that when they described the rise of knowledges from the 
understanding, they represented a flying horse which with his hoof broke open a fountain, where dwelt the virgins that were the sciences; and by the Trojan horse nothing else was signified than a contrivance 
of their understanding for destroying city walls.  Even at this day the intellect is often described, according to the custom received from those ancient people, under the figure of a flying 
horse, or Pegasus; and learning is described as a fountain; but scarcely anyone knows that a horse, in the mystic sense, signifies the understanding, and a fountain truth; still less that these significatives 
were handed down to the Gentiles from the Ancient Church. </p>

The origin of 'a horse' meaning the understanding part of the mind lies nowhere else than in representatives in the next life. Frequently there, in the world of spirits, horses which display great variety 
are seen, and also people seated on horses. And whenever they are seen the understanding is meant by them. Such representatives are of constant occurrence among spirits. It is because the horse 
is a representative of the understanding that when horses are mentioned in the Word the spirits and angels present with man know instantaneously that it is the understanding which is being spoken of. 
It is also why, when spirits from some other planet who have been endowed with intelligence and wisdom are raised up from the world of spirits into heaven, horses shining as though they consisted of fire 
appear, which I also have seen when those people were carried up. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This experience has made clear to me what is meant by the fiery chariot and the fiery horses which Elisha saw when Elijah went 
up with the whirlwind into heaven, and what also by Elisha's shout at that time, </p>
<p>My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and its riders. <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 2: <a href="11.htm">11</a>, <a href="12.htm">12</a>, </p>
<p>and by the same spoken by Joash 
king of Israel to Elisha when the latter was dying, </p>
<p>My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and its riders. <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 13: <a href="14.htm">14</a>. </p>
<p>In the Lord's Divine mercy it will be shown elsewhere that Elijah 
and Elisha represented the Lord as to the Word. That is to say, it will there be shown that the doctrine of love and charity drawn from the Word is meant by 'the fiery chariot', and the doctrine of 
faith deriving from these by 'the fiery horses'. The doctrine of faith is the same as an understanding of the Word as to its inner content, which is the internal sense. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 As regards chariots and 
horses being seen in heaven among spirits and angels, this is evident not only from the fact that they were seen by the prophets, such as by Zechariah (1: <a href="8.htm">8</a>-<a href="10.htm">10</a>; 6: <a href="1.htm">1</a>-<a href="7.htm">7</a>) and by others, but also by Elisha's 
servant, of whom the following is said in the Book of Kings, </p>
<p>Jehovah opened the eyes of Elisha's servant, and he saw; and behold the mountain was full of horses, and there were fiery chariots 
surrounding Elisha. Kings 6: <a href="17.htm">17</a>. </p>
<p>Furthermore, where the intelligent and wise dwell in the world of spirits, chariots and horses are constantly making their appearance, the reason being, as has been 
stated, that chariots and horses represent the things that belong to wisdom and intelligence. People who have been awakened after death and are entering the next life see represented to them a young 
man seated on a horse, who then dismounts. The meaning of this is that before they can enter heaven they have to be furnished with cognitions of good and truth - see Volume One, in <a href="187.htm">187</a>, <a href="188.htm">188</a>. The fact 
that chariots and horses meant those things was fully known in the Ancient Church, as becomes clear also from the Book of Job, a book of the Ancient Church, where these words occur, </p>
<p>God has made 
him forget wisdom and given him no share in intelligence. After raising himself on high he laughs at the horse and its rider. Job 39: <a href="17.htm">17</a>-<a href="19.htm">19</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The meaning of 'a horse' as the understanding spread 
from the Ancient Church to the wise in surrounding regions, and even into Greece. As a consequence of this, when describing the sun, which meant love, <a href="2441.htm">2441</a>, <a href="2495.htm">2495</a>, they placed the god of their wisdom 
and intelligence there in the sun, and gave him a chariot and four fiery horses. And when they described the god of the sea - the sea meaning knowledge in general, <a href="28.htm">28</a>, <a href="2120.htm">2120</a> - they gave horses to him also. 
And when they described the upsurge of knowledge from the understanding they portrayed it as a flying horse which with its hoof broke open a fountain where the virgins who were the branches of knowledge 
dwelt. And by the Trojan horse nothing else was meant than a device of their understanding for destroying city walls. Even today, when the understanding is being described, it is quite usual, 
drawing on the custom received from those people of old, to portray the understanding as a flying horse or Pegasus, and to portray learning as a fountain. Yet scarcely anyone knows that 'a horse' in the 
mystical sense means the understanding, and 'a fountain' truth, let alone that those images with a spiritual meaning spread to the gentiles from the Ancient Church. </p>

Quod `equus' intellectuale significet, non aliunde veniet quam ex repraesentativis in altera vita; multoties ibi in mundo spirituum videntur equi et hoc cum multa varietate, et quoque insidentes equis 
et quoties apparent, significant intellectuale; sunt talia repraesentativa continua apud spiritus. Ex repraesentativo `equi' quod sit intellectuale, est quod cum memorantur equi in Verbo, spiritus 
et angeli qui apud hominem, ilico sciant quod sit intellectuale de quo agitur: inde etiam est quod quibusdam spiritibus, ex quodam orbe aliunde, cum imbuti intelligentia et sapientia, e mundo spirituum 
elevantur in caelum, appareant equi lucidi sicut ignei; qui etiam mihi, cum illi sublati, visi sunt; [2] inde quid per `currum igneum et equos igneos' qui visi Elisaeo, cum Elias ascendit per turbinem 
in caelos, significatur, mihi constare potuit; tum quoque quid per exclamationem Elisaei tunc,      Pater mi, pater mi, currus Israelis et equites ejus, 2            Reg. ii 11, 12: </p>
<p>et per quod 
Joash rex Israelis similiter dixerit ad Elisaeum cum moreretur,      Pater mi, pater mi, currus Israelis et equites ejus, 2            Reg. xiii 14: </p>
<p>quod per Eliam et Elisaeum repraesentatus sit Dominus 
quoad Verbum, alibi, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, dicetur, nempe doctrina amoris et charitatis ex Verbo per `currum igneum,' et doctrina fidei inde per `equos igneos'; doctrina fidei est idem 
ac intellectus Verbi quoad interiora seu sensus internus. [3] Quod currus et equi appareant in caelis apud spiritus et angelos, constare non solum potest ex eo quod visi prophetis, ut Zachariae i 8-10; 
vi (x)1-7, et aliis, sed etiam puero Elisaei, de quo ita in Libro Regum,      Aperuit Jehovah oculos pueri Elisaei, et vidit, et ecce            mons plenus equis, et currus ignei circumcirca Elisaeum,  
         2 Reg. vi 17. Praeterea, ubi {1}in mundo spirituum mansio est intelligentium et sapientum, currus et equi continue apparent, ex causa, ut dictum, quia per currus et equos repraesentantur 
illa quae sapientiae et intelligentiae sunt.  Quod resuscitati post mortem, qui intrant in alteram vitam, repraesentatum sibi videant juvenem insidentem equo et dein descendentem ex equo, et quod 
per illud significetur quod cognitionibus boni et veri, antequam {2}in caelum venire possint,  instruendi, videatur in Parte Prima n. 187, 188. Quod `currus et equi' illa significaverint, notissimum 
fuit in Ecclesia Antiqua, ut quoque constare potest a libro Hiobi, qui est liber Antiquae Ecclesiae, ubi haec,      Oblivisci fecit eum Deus sapientiam, et non impertitus est ei      intelligentiam, 
juxta tempus in altum elevavit se, deridet      equum et equitem (c)illius xxxix 17-19. [4] Ex Antiqua Ecclesia significatio `equi' quod sit intellectuale, derivata est ad sapientes circumcirca, 
etiam in Graeciam; inde habuerunt, cum describerent solem, per quem significatus est amor, n. 2441, 2495, quod posuerint ibi sapientiae suae et intelligentiae deum, et ei tribuerint currum et quatuor 
equos igneos; et cum describerent deum maris, quia per mare {3}significatae sunt scientiae in communi, n. 28, 2120, {4}quod etiam illi dederint equos: et cum describerent ortum scientiarum ex intellectuali, 
quod finxerint equum volantem qui ungula rupit fontem ubi virgines quae scientiae; et per equum Trojanum nec aliud significatum fuit quam artificiale ex intellectu eorum destruendi muros. Hodie 
quidem, cum describitur intellectuale, ex recepto ab antiquis illis more, describi solet per equum volantem seu Pegasum, et eruditio per fontem, sed vix aliquis novit quod `equus' in sensu mystico significet 
intellectum, et `fons' verum; minus quod significativa illa ab Ecclesia Antiqua ad gentiles derivata sint. @1 after sapientum$ @2 ad$ @3 significarentur$ @4 after maris above$ </p>
