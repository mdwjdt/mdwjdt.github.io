Verses 29-34. And it came to pass at midnight, that Jehovah smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh about to sit upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the captive 
that was in the house of the pit, and all the firstborn of beast. And Pharaoh rose up in that night, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; because there 
was not a house where there was not one dead. And he called Moses and Aaron in the night, and said, Rise up, go ye out from the midst of my people, both ye and the sons of Israel; and go, serve Jehovah, 
according to your speaking. Also your flocks, also your herds, take ye, as ye spoke, and go, and bless me also. And Egypt was strong upon the people, hastening to send them out of the land; for they 
said, We are all dead. And the people carried their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs bound up in their clothes upon their shoulder. "And it came to pass at midnight," signifies 
a state of mere falsity from evil; "that Jehovah smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt," signifies the damnation of faith separate from charity; "from the firstborn of Pharaoh about to sit upon 
his throne," signifies the falsified truths of faith which are in the first place; "even unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the house of the pit," signifies the falsified truths of faith 
which are in the last place; "and all the firstborn of beast," signifies the adulterated good of faith; "and Pharaoh rose up in that night, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians," signifies that 
all and each of the damned, when they were let into mere falsity from evil, felt aversion and fear for those who were of the spiritual church; "and there was a great cry in Egypt," signifies interior 
lamentation; "because there was not a house where there was not one dead," signifies because there was no one who was not damned; "and he called Moses and Aaron in the night," signifies the afflux of 
truth from the Divine in that state; "and said, Rise up, go ye out from the midst of my people," signifies that they should depart from them; "both ye and the sons of Israel," signifies with their truth 
from the Divine, and with the truth through which is good, and with the truth which is from good; "and go, serve Jehovah," signifies that they should worship the Lord; "according to your speaking," 
signifies according to the will; "also your flocks, also your herds, take ye," signifies the goods of charity, interior and exterior; "as ye spoke," signifies according to the will; "and go," signifies 
that they should depart altogether; "and bless me also," signifies that they should intercede; "and Egypt was strong upon the people, hastening to send them out of the land," signifies that from 
aversion and fear they were urgent that they should depart; "for they said, We are all dead," signifies thus hell for them; "and the people carried their dough before it was leavened," signifies the first 
state of truth from good in which there is nothing of falsity; "their kneading troughs bound up in their clothes," signifies the delights of the affections, which delights adhere to truths; "upon 
their shoulder," signifies according to all ability. </p>

Verses 29-34 And it happened at midnight, that Jehovah struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from Pharaoh's firstborn who was to sit on his throne even to the firstborn of the prisoner who was 
in the dungeon,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> [and all the firstborn of the beasts]. And Pharaoh rose that night, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was no house where there 
was not one dead. And he called Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise, go out from the midst of my people, both you and the children of Israel; and go, serve Jehovah, in accordance with what you 
have spoken. Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have spoken, and go; and may you also bless me. And Egypt pressed the people, in a hurry to send them away from the land; for they said, We 
are all dying. And the people carried their dough before the yeast was added, their kneading bowls bound up in their clothes on their shoulder. </p>
<p>'And it happened at midnight' means a state of nothing 
but falsity arising from evil. 'That Jehovah struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt' means the damnation of faith separated from charity. 'From Pharaoh's firstborn who was to sit on his throne' 
means falsified truths of faith that occupy the first place. 'Even to the firstborn of the prisoner who was in the dungeon' means falsified truths of faith that occupy the last place of all. 'And all 
the firstborn of the beasts' means adulterated good of faith. 'And Pharaoh rose that night, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians' means that when all the damned without exception were brought 
into a state of nothing but falsity arising from evil they felt a loathing and fear of those belonging to the spiritual Church. 'And there was a great cry in Egypt' means deep grief. 'For there was 
no house where there was not one dead' means because there was none who was not damned. 'And he called Moses and Aaron by night' means the afflux of truth from God in that state. 'And said, Rise, go out 
from the midst of my people' means that they should depart from them. 'Both you and the children of Israel' means together with their truth from God, and with truth that leads to good and truth which 
springs from good. 'Go, serve Jehovah' means in order to worship the Lord. 'In accordance with what you have spoken' means in accordance with their will. 'Take both your flocks and your herds' means 
interior forms and exterior forms of the good of charity. 'As you have spoken' means in accordance with their will. 'And go' means that they should altogether depart. 'And may you also bless me' means 
that they should intercede. 'And Egypt pressed the people, in a hurry to send them away from the land' means that because of their loathing and fear of them they were urging them to depart. 'For they 
said, We are all dying' means for the reason that hell was facing them. 'And the people carried their dough before the yeast was added' means the first state of truth from good, in which there is no 
falsity at all. 'Their kneading bowls bound up in their clothes' means delights that belong to affections and cling to truths. 'On their shoulder' means supported with all the power they had.

Vers. 29-34.  Et factum in media nocte, et Jehovah percussit omne primogenitum in terra Aegypti, a primogenito Pharaonis sessuro super throno illius, usque ad primogenitum captivi qui in domo foveae 
[, et omne primogenitum bestiae].  Et surrexit Pharao nocte illa, et omnes servi illius, et omnes Aegyptii, et fuit clamor magnus in Aegypto, quia nulla domus ubi non mortuus.  Et vocavit Moschen et 
Aharonem noctu, et dixit, Surgite, exite e medio populi mei, etiam vos, etiam filii Israelis, et ite, servite Jehovae, secundum loqui vos.  Etiam greges vestros, etiam armenta vestra accipite, quemadmodum 
locuti estis, et ite, et benedicatis etiam mihi.  Et invaluit Aegyptus super populum, festinando dimittere illos e terra, quia dixerunt, Omnes nos morimur.  Et portavit populus massam suam antequam 
fermentaretur, mactrae illorum ligatae in vestibus illorum super humero illorum.  `Et factum in media nocte' significat statum meri falsi ex malo: `et Jehovah percussit omne primogenitum in terra Aegypti' 
significat damnationem fidei separatae a charitate: `a primogenito Pharaonis sessuro super throno illius' significat vera falsificata fidei quae primo loco: `usque ad primogenitum captivi qui 
in domo foveae' significat vera falsificata fidei quae postremo loco: `et omne primogenitum bestiae' significat bonum fidei adulteratum: `et surrexit Pharao nocte ista, et omnes servi illius, et omnes 
Aegyptii' significat quod damnati omnes et singuli cum in merum falsum a malo immissi sunt, apperciperent aversationem (c)et timorem pro illis qui ab Ecclesia spirituali: `et fuit clamor magnus in Aegypto' 
significat lamentationem interiorem: `quia nulla domus ubi non mortuus' significat quia nullus non damnatus {1}: `et vocavit Moschen et Aharonem noctu significat affluxum veri a Divino in statu 
illo: `et dixit, Surgite, exite e medio populi mei' significat quod discederent ab illis: `etiam vos, etiam filii Israelis' significat cum vero illorum a Divino, et cum vero per quod bonum, et cum vero 
quod ex bono: `ite, servite Jehovae' significat ut colant Dominum: `secundum loqui vos' significat secundum voluntatem: `etiam greges vestros, etiam armenta vestra accipite' significat charitatis bona 
interiora et exteriora: `quemadmodum (x)locuti estis' significat secundum voluntatem: `et ite' significat ut omnino discedant: `et benedicatis etiam mihi' significat ut intercedant: `et invaluit Aegyptus 
super populum, festinando dimittere illos e terra' significat quod ex {2}aversatione et timore urgerent ut discederent: `quia dixerunt, Omnes nos morimur significat sic infernum illis: `et portavit 
populus massam suam antequam fermentaretur' significat statum primum veri ex bono, in quo nihil falsi: `mactrae illorum ligatae in vestibus illorum' significat jucunda affectionum adhaerentia veris: 
`super humero illorum' significat secundum omnem potentiam. 	@1 i (domus pro mente)$ 	@2 aversione I$ </p>
