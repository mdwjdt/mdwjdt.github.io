<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1754节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1754.</strong>“亚乃、以实各、幔利”表他们所具有的事物。这从前面（14:13）有关这三人的论述清楚可知，也就是说，他们的名字表示良善与真理，争战与其说通过天使自己发起，倒不如说通过这些良善与真理发起。因为如前所述，天使用“少年人”和“人”来表示。天使从没有个人的名字，而是根据他们具有的各种良善与真理而彼此区分。鉴于此，圣言中的名字无非表示被命名者的本质及其性质或秉性，并不表示别的，如前所示（<a href="144.htm">144</a>，<a href="145.htm">145</a>，<a href="340.htm">340</a>节）。这一点也清楚可见于以赛亚书，那里论到主说：<br />祂名称为奇妙、策士、神、勇士、永恒的父、和平的君！（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.6.htm">9:6</a>）<br />“名”在此用来表示祂的性质，也就是说，祂是奇妙、策士、神、勇士、永恒的父、和平的君。<br />耶利米书论到主说：<br />这是祂的名，他们称祂为耶和华我们的义。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.5.htm">23:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.6.htm">6</a>）<br />此处显而易见，这“名”是义。摩西书同样论及主说：<br />祂必不赦免你们的过犯，因为祂是奉我名来的。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出23.21.htm">23:21</a>）<br />此处“名”也表本质，这本质就是神性。这同样从圣言中的很多其它经文清楚看出来，那里的经文说“他们呼求耶和华的名”；“不可妄称耶和华的名”；在主祷文中，“尊你的名”。天使的名字也是这种情形，如此处代表天使的“以实各、亚乃、幔利”的名字，因为这些名字表示天使所具有的事物。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1754.</strong> Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre, symbolize characteristics of [the angels], as can be seen from remarks concerning these men above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1754/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_13" target=_top>13</a> of the current chapter [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1754/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1705" target=_top>1705</a>]. To be specific, their names symbolize good impulses and true ideas used in the struggle, and not so much the angels themselves, because it is the young men and adult men who symbolize angels, as noted. Angels never have any name but are differentiated by the quality of their goodness and truth. Consequently, a name in the Word symbolizes nothing else than a person's vital essence and its character, as already shown (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1754/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_144" target=_top>144</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1754/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_145" target=_top>145</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1754/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_340" target=_top>340</a>). The same thing can also be seen in Isaiah, where he says of the Lord:<br />His name will be called Miraculous, Counselor, God, Hero, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1754/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_9_6" target=_top>Isaiah 9:6</a>)<br />[2] His name means what he is like — miraculous, a counselor, God, hero, eternal father, and prince of peace. In Jeremiah, where he too speaks of the Lord:<br />This is his name that they will call him: Jehovah our justice. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1754/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_23_5-6" target=_top>Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>)<br />This says explicitly that his name is his justice. In Moses, too, where he also speaks of the Lord:<br />He will not put up with your transgressing, since my name is in the middle of him. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1754/bible_king-james-version_exodus_23_21" target=_top>Exodus 23:21</a>)<br />Here too his name stands for the divinity of his essential nature. In addition it can be seen from many verses in the Word that say, "they called on Jehovah's name;"{*1} that they were "not to take up Jehovah's name unworthily" [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1754/bible_king-james-version_exodus_20_7" target=_top>Exodus 20:7</a>]; and in the Lord's Prayer, "may your name be held sacred" [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1754/bible_king-james-version_matthew_6_9" target=_top>Matthew 6:9</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1754/bible_king-james-version_luke_11_2" target=_top>Luke 11:2</a>]. It is the same with angels' names, and here with the names of Eshcol, Aner, and Mamre, who represent angels: they symbolize the characteristics of angels.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For passages that speak of calling on Jehovah's name, see, for instance, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1754/bible_king-james-version_genesis_4_26" target=_top>Genesis 4:26</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1754/bible_king-james-version_genesis_12_8" target=_top>12:8</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1754/bible_king-james-version_genesis_13_4" target=_top>13:4</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1754/bible_king-james-version_genesis_21_33" target=_top>21:33</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1754/bible_king-james-version_genesis_26_25" target=_top>26:25</a>.

Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. That these signify the things appertaining to them, is evident from what is said above in this chapter (at verse 13) concerning the same, namely, that by their names are signified 
the goods and truths from which the combat was waged, and not so much the angels themselves, for the angels are meant by "the lads," and "the men," as has been said. For the angels never have any 
name given them, but are distinguished in respect to their quality by goods and truths; and on this account nothing else is signified in the Word by a name but the essence and its quality (as before 
shown, n. 144, 145, 340). This may be seen also in Isaiah, where the Lord is spoken of: </p>
<p>     His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, God, Hero, Father of eternity, Prince of Peace (Isa. 9:6), where 
by the "name" is meant of what quality He is, that is, that He is Wonderful, Counselor, God, a Hero, Father of eternity, Prince of Peace. [2] In Jeremiah, where also the Lord is spoken of: </p>
<p> 
    This is His name whereby they shall call Him, Jehovah our Righteousness (Jer. 23:5, 6) where it is plainly evident that the name is "Righteousness." So too in Moses, where likewise the Lord is spoken 
of: </p>
<p>     He will not bear your transgression, for My name is in the midst of Him (Exod. 23:21), where also the "name" denotes the essence, as being Divine. So also in many other passages of the 
Word, where it is said that "they called on the name of Jehovah;" that "they should not take the name of Jehovah in vain;" and in the Lord's Prayer, "Hallowed be Thy name." The case is similar with the 
names of angels; and is so here with the names of Eshcol, Aner, and Mamre, who represent angels, in that these names signify the things appertaining to the angels. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1754</b></p><p><b>1754.</b>
'Aner, Eshkol, and Mamre' means the things residing with them. This is clear from what has been stated about the same three at verse 13 above, that is to say, that by the names of these men are meant 
the goods and truths from which the battle was fought rather than the angels themselves; for, as has been stated, angels are meant by the expressions 'young men' and 'men', since angels do not ever have 
personal names but are distinguished from one another by the kinds of goods and truths with them. This is why in the Word nothing else is meant by 'a name' than the essence and the nature or character 
of the named, as shown already in <a href="144.htm">144</a>, <a href="145.htm">145</a>, <a href="340.htm">340</a>, and as becomes clear also in Isaiah, where the Lord is spoken of, </p>
<blockquote>
His name will be called, Wonderful, Counsellor, God, Hero, Father of Eternity, 
Prince of Peace. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%209:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 9:6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Name' is here used to mean His nature, that is to say, that He is Wonderful, Counsellor, God, Hero, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In Jeremiah, where 
also the Lord is spoken of, </p>
<blockquote>
This is His name which they will call Him, Jehovah our Righteousness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2023:5,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 23:5, 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here it is quite clear that the 'name' is Righteousness. Then in Moses, where also 
the Lord is spoken of, </p>
<blockquote>
He will not endure your transgression for My name is in the midst of Him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2023:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 23:21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here too 'name' stands for Essence - that it is Divine. The same is in addition clear 
from many other places in the Word where it is said that men called on the name of Jehovah, that they should not take Jehovah's name in vain; and in the Lord's Prayer, Hallowed be Your name. The same 
applies with the names of angels, as it does here with the names Eshkol, Aner, and Mamre, who represent angels, in that those names mean the things that exist with angels. </p>

'Aner, Eshkol et Mamre': quod significent illa quae apud eos, constat ab illis quae supra hoc capite ad vers. 13 de iisdem dicta sunt, nempe quod per nomina horum significentur bona et vera ex quibus 
pugnatum, non ita angeli, quia angeli intellecti sunt per pueros et viros, ut dictum; angelis enim nusquam aliquod nomen est, sed dignoscuntur ex bonis et veris quales sunt, quare nec per 'nomen' in 
Verbo aliud significatur quam essentia et ejus qualitas, ut ostensum prius n. 144, 145, 340, ut quoque constare potest apud Esaiam ubi de Domino, 	Vocabitur nomen Ipsius, Mirabilis, Consiliarius, Deus, 
Heros, Pater aeternitatis, Princeps pacis, ix 5, 6; </p>
<p>ubi per 'nomen' intelligitur qualis est, nempe quod mirabilis, consiliarius, Deus, heros, pater aeternitatis, princeps pacis: [2] apud Jeremiam 
ubi etiam de Domino, 	Hoc nomen Ipsius, quod appellabunt Ipsum, Jehovah justitia nostra, xxiii 5, 6; </p>
<p>ubi quod 'nomen' sit justitia, manifeste constat; tum apud Mosen ubi etiam de Domino, 	Non sustinebit 
praevaricationem vestram, quoniam nomen Meum in medio Ipsius, Exod. xxiii 21; </p>
<p>ubi 'nomen' quoque pro Essentia quod Divina; praeter a multis locis in Verbo ubi dicitur quod invocaverint nomen Jehovae; 
quod non in vanum acciperent nomen Jehovae; et in Oratione Domini, sanctificatum sit nomen Tuum: similiter se habet cum nominibus angelorum; et similiter hic cum nominibus Eshkol, Aner et Mamre 
qui repraesentant angelos, quod significentur illa quae apud angelos. </p>
