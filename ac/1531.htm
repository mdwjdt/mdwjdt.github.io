<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1531.</strong>为向我证实以下事实，即主向属天天使显为太阳，向属灵天使显为月亮，蒙主怜悯，我的内在视觉被打开，以便我能清楚看到环绕着众多小月亮的闪光月亮，照以赛亚书上的话说，它们的光几近于那太阳的光：<br />月光必像日光。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.26.htm">30:26</a>）<br />不过，我可以看到那太阳，而月亮则出现我前面右侧。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1531.</strong> For proof to me that he appears before heavenly angels as a sun and before spiritual angels as a moon, the Lord in his divine mercy opened my inner eyes to look all the way into heaven. There I saw clearly a radiant moon ringed by many smaller moonlets, whose combined light was almost as strong as the sun's. As Isaiah said, "The light of the moon will be like the light of the sun" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1531/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_30_26" target=_top>Isaiah 30:26</a>). But a sight of the sun was not given to me.<br />The moon appeared out in front, toward the right.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Regarding Swedenborg's descriptions of position in the other world, see note 2 in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1531/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_947" target=_top>947</a>. In a similar pas.12e, Spiritual Experiences (Swedenborg 1998-2002) 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1531/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_4219" target=_top>4219</a>, this moon is also described as appearing "out in front," but Swedenborg says there that it did not appear toward the right, "where the Lord is," but above.

That I might be confirmed in the truth that the Lord appears to the celestial angels as a Sun, and to the spiritual angels as a Moon, my interior sight was of the Lord's Divine mercy so far opened that 
I plainly saw the Moon shining, which was encompassed by a number of smaller moons, the light of which was almost solar, according to the words in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The light of the moon shall be as the 
light of the sun (Isa. 30:26). But it was not granted me to see the Sun. The Moon appeared in front, to the right. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1531</b></p><p><b>1531.</b>
To confirm for me the fact that the Lord appears to celestial angels as the Sun and to spiritual angels as the Moon, my interior sight was in the Lord's Divine mercy opened to the point where I saw plainly 
a shining Moon surrounded by a number of smaller moons. Their light amounted almost to that of the sun, in accordance with the words in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The light of the moon will be as the light of 
the sun. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2030:26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 30:26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>But I was not allowed to behold the Sun. The Moon appeared in front of me to the right. </p>

</p><b>1531.</b>
Ut confirmarer in illo quod Dominus appareat angelis caelestibus ut Sol, et angelis spiritualibus ut Luna, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, aperiebatur mihi visus interior eo usque, et manifeste vidi 
Lunam splendentem, quae erat pluribus lunulis minoribus cincta, quarum lumen erat paene solare, secundum illa apud Esaiam, Erit lux lunae sicut lux solis, xxx 26; </p>
<p>sed solem non videre datum: luna antrorsum 
ad dextrum apparuit. </p>
