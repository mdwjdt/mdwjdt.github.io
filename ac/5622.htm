<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5622节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5622.</strong>“开心果，杏仁”表示与这些真理相一致的生活良善。这从“开心果”和“杏仁”的含义清楚可知：“开心果”是指与“乳香”所表示的外层属世层的良善之真理相一致的生活良善，如下文所述；“杏仁”是指与“香蜡和没药”所表示的内层属世层的良善之真理相一致的生活良善。这些“坚果”之所以具有这种含义，是因为它们是果实；在圣言中，“果实”表示行为；有用的树所结的果实表示好行为或良善行为，或也可说，生活的良善，因为就所发挥的功用而言，生活的良善就是好行为或良善行为。“开心果”之所以表示与外层属世层的良善之真理相一致的生活良善，是因为它们是次等树种所结的果实；系外层的事物由次等事物来表示，因为外层事物本质上比内层事物更笼统；事实上，它们是由大量内层事物所构成的总体表象。<br />“杏仁”之所以表示与内层属世层的良善之真理相一致的生活良善，是因为杏树是优良、高等树种。这种树本身在灵义上表示对源于良善的内层真理的觉知，杏花表示源于良善的内层真理，而杏表示由这真理所产生的生活良善。耶利米书就在灵义上论及“杏树”：<br />耶和华的话又临到我说，耶利米，你看见什么？我说，我看见一根杏树杖。耶和华对我说，你看得不错；因为我留意我的话来作成它。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶1.11.htm">1:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶1.12.htm">12</a>）<br />一根“杖”表示能力；“杏树”表示对内层真理的觉知；这根枝子在此因论及耶和华，故表示对那真理的看顾；“话”表示真理。<br />“利未支族亚伦发芽的杖”也表示仁之良善或生活的良善，对此，我们在摩西五经中读到：<br />到了第二天，摩西进会幕去。看哪，利未支派亚伦的杖已经发了芽，生了花苞，开了花，结了熟杏。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民17.8.htm">17:8</a>）<br />这是该支派被拣选作祭司的标志；因为“利未支派”表示仁爱（参看<a href="3875.htm">3875</a>，<a href="3877.htm">3877</a>，<a href="4497.htm">4497</a>，<a href="4502.htm">4502</a>，<a href="4503.htm">4503</a>节），仁爱是属灵教会的本质特征。</p>

Terebinth* nuts and almonds. That this signifies goods of life corresponding to these truths, is evident from the signification of "terebinth* nuts," as being goods of life corresponding to the truths 
of good of the exterior natural which are signified by "resin" (of which in what follows); and from the signification of "almonds," as being goods of life corresponding to the truths of good of the 
interior natural which are signified by "aromatic wax and stacte." That these "nuts" have this signification is because they are fruits, and "fruits" in the Word signify works; the fruits of useful trees 
good works, or what is the same, goods of the life, for in respect to use the goods of life are good works. That "terebinth* nuts" signify goods of life corresponding to truths of good of the exterior 
natural, is because they are of a less noble tree; and things that are exterior are signified by such objects as are less noble. The reason is, that in themselves exterior things are grosser than 
interior; for they are generals composed of very many interior things. [2] That "almonds" signify goods of life corresponding to the truths of good of the interior natural, is because the almond is 
a nobler tree. This tree itself signifies in the spiritual sense a perception of interior truth which is from good, its "blossom" interior truth which is from good, and its "fruit" good of life thence 
derived. In this sense the "almond tree" is spoken of in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>	The word of Jehovah came to pass, saying, Jeremiah what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree. Then said Jehovah unto 
me, Thou hast well seen; for I wake over My word to do it (Jer. 1:11-12); </p>
<p>a "rod" denotes power; "almond tree," the perception of interior truth; here, being predicated of Jehovah, it denotes waking 
over it; "word" denotes truth. [3] By the "almonds which budded from the rod of Aaron for the tribe of Levi," are also signified goods of charity or goods of life, of which we read in Moses: </p>
<p>	It 
came to pass on the morrow, when Moses entered into the tent of meeting, behold the rod of Aaron for the tribe of Levi had blossomed and brought forth blossom, so that the flower flowered, and bare almonds 
(Num. 17:8). This was a sign that this tribe was chosen for the priesthood; for by the "the tribe of Levi" was signified charity (see n. 3875, 3877, 4497, 4502, 4503), which is the essential of 
the spiritual church. * pistachio </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5622</b></p><p><b>5622.</b>
'Pistachio nuts and almonds' means forms of the good of life that agree with those truths. This is clear from the meaning of 'pistachio nuts' as forms of the good of life that agree with the truths of 
exterior natural good, meant by 'resin', dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'almonds' as forms of the good of life that agree with the truths of interior natural good, meant by 'aromatic wax 
and stacte'. Those nuts have that meaning because they are fruits, and 'fruits' in the Word means deeds - fruits produced by useful trees meaning good deeds, or what amounts to the same, forms of the 
good of life, since these, so far as the use they serve is concerned, are good deeds. The reason 'pistachio nuts' means forms of the good of life that agree with the truths of exterior natural good is 
that they are the fruit borne by an inferior kind of tree, and things of an exterior nature are meant by objects of an inferior kind, for the reason that essentially exterior things are not so specific 
as interior ones since they are the general appearances produced by large numbers of inner components. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason 'almonds' means forms of the good of life that agree with the truths of interior 
natural good is that the almond is a superior kind of tree. In the spiritual sense the tree itself means a perception of interior truth derived from good, its blossom means interior truth derived 
from good, while its fruit means the good of life resulting from that truth. The word 'almond' is used with this meaning in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The word of Jehovah came [to me], saying, What do you see, Jeremiah? 
And I said, A rod of almond do I see. Then Jehovah said to me, You have seen well,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> for I am watching over My word to perform it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%201:11,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 1:11, 12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'A rod' stands for power, 'almond' for a perception 
of interior truth; and because this rod is said to be Jehovah's it stands for a watching over that truth -'word' standing for truth.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The almonds which blossomed on Aaron's rod for the tribe 
of Levi also mean the good deeds of charity or forms of the good of life. They are described in Moses as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
It happened the next day, when Moses went into the tent of meeting, that behold, 
Aaron's rod for the house<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> of Levi had blossomed, and had produced buds,<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> so that it flowered and produced almonds. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2017:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 17:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This was the sign that that tribe had been chosen for the priesthood; 
for charity was meant by that tribe, <a href="3875.htm">3875</a>, <a href="3877.htm">3877</a>, <a href="4497.htm">4497</a>, <a href="4502.htm">4502</a>, <a href="4503.htm">4503</a>, and charity is the essential characteristic of the spiritual Church.

`Nuces terebinthinas et amygdalas':  quod significet bona vitae illis veris correspondentia, constat ex significatione `nucum terebinthinarum' quod sint bona vitae correspondentia veris boni naturalis 
exterioris, quae per `resinam' significantur, de qua sequitur; et ex significatione `amygdalorum' quod sint bona vitae {1}correspondentia veris boni naturalis interioris, quae per `ceram aromaticam 
et stacten' {2}significantur {3}.  Quod nuces illae significent talia, est quia sunt fructus, et `fructus' in Verbo significant opera, `fructus arborum utilium' bona opera, seu quod idem, bona vitae, 
nam bona vitae {4}quoad usum sunt bona opera. Quod `nuces terebinthinae' significent bona vitae veris boni naturalis exterioris correspondentia, est quia sunt arboris minus nobilis, et quae exteriora 
sunt, per talia quae minus nobilia sunt, significantur; causa est quia exteriora in se crassiora sunt interioribus, {5}nam sunt communia ex perpluribus interiorum composita. [2]At quod `amygdalae' significent 
bona vitae veris boni naturalis interioris correspondentia, est quia amygdalus est arbor nobilior; `ipsa arbor' significat in spirituali sensu perceptionem veri interioris quod ex bono, `ejus' 
flos' verum interius quod ex bono, et `(t)ejus fructus' bonum vitae ex illo, in hoc sensu dicitur amygdalus apud Jeremiam, 	Factum est verbum Jehovae, dicendo, Quid vides Jeremia? et dixi, Baculum 
amygdali ego video; tum dixit Jehovah ad me, Probe fecisti videndo, quia vigilans Ego super verbo Meo, ut faciam illud, i 11 (,12); </p>
<p>`baculus' pro potentia, `amygdalus' pro perceptione veri interioris, 
hi quia praedicatur de Jehovah, pro vigilatione super illo, `verbum' pro vero. Per amygdalas quae effloruerunt ex baculo Aharonis pro tribu Levi etiam significantur bona charitatis seu bona vitae, 
de quibus ita apud Mosen, 	Factum postridie, cum intravit Moses in tentorium conventus, ecce effloruerat baculus Aharonis pro tribu Levi, et produxerat florem, ut floreret flos, et ferret amygdalas, 
Num. xvii 23 (A. V. xvii8); </p>
<p>hoc signum erat quod illa tribus electa fuerit in sacerdotium, quia per illam significata fuit charitas, n. 3875, 3877, 4497, 4502, 4503, quae est essentiale Ecclesiae spiritualis. @1
