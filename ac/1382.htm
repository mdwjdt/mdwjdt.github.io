<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1382节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1382.</strong>人们不可避免地将神性无限与空间的无限相混淆。因为他们不理解空间的无限，除非把它想象成虚无的东西，事实上，他们并不相信神性无限。永恒的情形也一样。他们只会将其想象为时间上的永恒，因为它通过时间被呈现给那些处于时空中的人。神性无限的真实观念通过以下事实被灌输给天使：他们会瞬间出现在主的视线之下，没有任何空间或时间的间隔，哪怕他们在宇宙的极处。神性永恒的观念则以下列事实被灌输给他们：数千年在他们看来不象是一段时间，他们仿佛只过了一分钟。这两种观念还通过这一事实被灌输给他们：其当下既包括过去，也包括未来。所以，他们并不忧虑将来，也没有死亡的概念，只知道生命。因此，主的永恒和无限就包含在他们整个当下里面。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1382.</strong> People on earth cannot help confusing God's infinity with infinity of space, and since their only idea of spatial infinity is that it is nothing — which is true — they also fail to believe in the divine infinity.<br />The case is the same with divine eternity. People cannot understand it except in terms of eternal time. But it is still presented as a temporal phenomenon with those who are caught up in the concept of time.<br />A true picture of God's infinity is instilled into angels by the consideration that they can come into the Lord's presence in a split second, without any intervening space or time, even if they should be at the ends of the universe. A true picture of God's eternity is instilled by way of the idea that the passing of thousands of years seems like no time to them; it is almost as if they had lived for just a moment. And both concepts come by way of the idea that in their present they have both past and future. For this reason, they do not worry about events that are yet to come. They never think about death but only about life.<br />Thus for them, every present moment contains the Lord's eternity and infinity. </p>

Men cannot but confound the Divine Infinity with infinity of space; and as they have no apprehension of infinity of space except as of a nothing, which in fact it is, they do not believe in the Divine 
Infinity. Such also is the case with the Eternity, which men cannot conceive of except as an eternity of time, since it is presented by means of time to those who are in time. The true idea of the Divine 
Infinity is insinuated into the angels by the fact that they are instantly present under the Lord's sight, with no intervening space or time, even though they were at the furthest extremity of the 
universe; and the true idea of the Divine Eternity is insinuated by the fact that thousands of years do not appear to them as time, but scarcely otherwise than as if they had lived only a minute; and 
both ideas are insinuated by the fact that in their present they have past and future things together. Hence they have no solicitude about future things; nor have they ever any idea of death, but only 
the idea of life; so that in all their present there is the Lord's Eternity and Infinity. </p>

People inevitably confuse Divine Infinity with infinity of space. And because they do not conceive of infinity of space as anything other than nothingness, as indeed it is, neither do they believe in 
Divine Infinity. The same applies to Eternity. They cannot conceive of it except as an eternity of time, but it is manifested continually by means of time to those who dwell within [space and] time. 
The true idea of Divine Infinity is instilled into angels by their being instantaneously under the Lord's view with no intervening space or time even if they came from the ends of the universe. And the 
true idea of Divine Eternity is instilled into them by the fact that thousands of years do not appear to them as a period of time, almost as if they had lived for only a minute. Both ideas are also 
instilled by means of the fact that the present with them includes past and future together. Consequently they have no anxiety about things of the future, nor do they ever have any idea of death, but 
only of life And so their whole present includes within it the Lord's Eternity and Infinity. </p>

</p><b>1382.</b>
Homines non possunt aliter ac confundere Infinitum Divinum cum infinito spatii, et quia non capiunt infinitum spatii aliter ac quod nihil sit ut quoque est, ideo nec credunt Infinitum Divinum: similiter 
se habet cum Aeterno, quod homines non capere possunt nisi sicut aeternum temporis, sed sistitur usque per tempus apud eos qui in tempore sunt: ipsa idea Infiniti Divini insinuatur angelis per id 
quod momento adsint sub conspectu Domini si vel forent a fine universi, nullo intercedente spatio aut tempore: et ipsa idea Aeterni Divini per id quod millia annorum non appareant iis ut tempus, vix 
aliter ac sicut vixissent minutum; et utrumque per id quod in suo praesenti habeant simul praeterita et futura: inde illis nulla sollicitudo de futuris; nec usquam aliqua idea mortis sed solum idea vitae: 
ita in omni illorum praesenti est Domini Aeternum et Infinitum. </p>
