<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10253节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10253</strong>.“五百舍客勒”表完全或完整之物。这从“五百”的含义清楚可知，“五百”是指完全或完整之物。“五百”之所以具有这种含义，是因为这个数字是五两次乘以十，或五乘以一百的乘积；而“五”表示大量，“十”和“一百”同样表示大量；因此，“五百”表示完全或完整之物。“五”表示大量（参看<a href="5708.htm">5708</a>，<a href="5956.htm">5956</a>，<a href="9102.htm">9102</a>节）；“十”也是（参看<a href="3107.htm">3107</a>，<a href="4638.htm">4638</a>节）；“一百”同样如此（参看<a href="4400.htm">4400</a>，<a href="6582.htm">6582</a>，<a href="6594.htm">6594</a>节）；在圣言中，一切数字皆表示真实事物（参看<a href="9488.htm">9488</a>节提到的地方）；复合数具有和通过相乘得到它们的简单数一样的含义（<a href="5291.htm">5291</a>，<a href="5335.htm">5335</a>，<a href="5708.htm">5708</a>，<a href="7973.htm">7973</a>节）。<br />数字表示属灵的真实事物，这一点在以西结书是非常清楚的，以西结书40-48章通过标明尺寸的数字测量并描述了神的房子和它里外的一切，以及新地；在那里，“新地”表示教会，“神的房子”（或译为神殿）表示它的神圣。这在约翰所写的启示录中也是如此，那里也通过标明尺寸的数字来描述新耶路撒冷，而新耶路撒冷同样表示一个新教会。如果数字并非表示属灵的真实事物，那么所有这些测量尺寸都是毫无意义的。<br />“五百”表示从一端到另一端的整体，因而表示完全或完整之物。这一点从以西结书的这些章节清楚看出来：<br />他在房子或殿外量四围，量东面五百竿；量北面五百竿；量南面五百竿；量五百西面竿；将圣的与俗的分别出来。。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结42.15.htm">42:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结42.20.htm">20</a>）<br />从这些话明显可知，“五百”表示完整的整体，或从一端到另一端皆神圣的一切事物，因而表示完全或完整之物；因为经上说，城墙（根据对它的长和宽的描述，呈正方形）将圣的与俗的分别出来。<br />“五百”表示大量，而这个数量的十分之一，或“五十”表示些许。这一点从主在路加福音中对西门所说的话明显看出来：<br />耶稣说，有一个债主有两个欠债的，一个欠五百便士，一个欠五十便士。因为他们无力偿还，债主就开恩免了他们两个人的债。这两个人哪一个更爱他呢？西门回答说，是那多得恩免的人。耶稣说，她许多的罪都赦免了，因为她的爱多；但那赦免少的，他的爱就少。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路7.41至末尾.htm">7:41至末尾</a>）<br />主之所以用这些数字，是因为它们表示大量和些许；因为祂出于神性，因而通过根据对应而具有灵义的词语来说话。这在其它一切地方也一样，如当祂论到童女时，说她们有十个，五个是聪明的，五个是愚拙的。祂之所以说“十个”，是因为这个数字表示所有，也就是所有属于教会的人；说“五个”，是因为这个数字表示些许（<a href="4637.htm">4637</a>，<a href="4638.htm">4638</a>节）。</p>

Five hundred. That this signifies full, is evident from the signification of the number "five hundred," as being what is full. That "five hundred" denotes what is full is because this number is compounded 
of five twice multiplied by ten, or five times a hundred; and by "five" is signified much, in like manner by "ten," and by a "hundred;" hence by "five hundred" is signified what is full. (That by 
"five" is signified much, see n. 5708, 5956, 9102; so by "ten," n. 3107, 4638; also by a "hundred," n. 4400, 6582, 6594; and that all numbers in the Word signify real things, see the places cited in 
n. 9488; and that compound numbers signify the like as the simple ones from which they come forth by multiplication, n. 5291, 5335, 5708, 7973.) [2] That numbers signify real things is clearly evident 
in Ezekiel, where the house of God with all within and without it, and also the new earth, are measured, and are described by the numbers of the measure (chapters 40 to 48); and by the "new earth" 
is there meant the church, and by the "house of God" the holiness of it; in like manner by John in Revelation, where also the New Jerusalem, by which also is meant a new church, is described by the numbers 
of the measure. If numbers had not signified real things, all these measurements would have been of no value. [3] That "five hundred" signifies the whole from one end to the other, thus what is 
full, is evident from this in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     He measured outside the house, or temple, on the eastern quarter, five hundred reeds round about; on the northern quarter five hundred reeds round about; 
on the southern quarter five hundred reeds; and on the quarter of the sea five hundred reeds. Its wall round about; the length five hundred reeds, and the breadth five hundred reeds; to distinguish between 
that which was holy and that which was profane (Ezek. 42:15-20); </p>
<p>from which words it is plain that "five hundred" denotes the whole in the complex, or everything holy from one end to the other, 
thus what is full, for it is said that the wall, which was of this length and breadth in a square, distinguished between what was holy and what was profane. [4] That "five hundred" signifies much; and 
its tenth part, or "fifty," relatively something is evident from the Lord's words to Simon in Luke: </p>
<p>     Jesus said, A certain creditor had two debtors; the one owed five hundred pence, and the other 
fifty. When they had nothing to pay, he forgave them both; therefore which of them will love him most? Simon answered, He to whom he forgave most. Jesus said, Just so the woman's many sins are forgiven, 
because she loved much; but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little (Luke 7:41, to the end). The Lord employed these numbers because they signified much and something; for He spoke 
from the Divine, thus by means of significatives according to correspondences; and also in all other places, as when He spoke of the virgins, whom He called "ten," and "five" of them wise, and "five" 
foolish. He said "ten," because by this number are signified all, that is, of the church; and "five," because by this number is signified some part (n. 4637, 4638). </p>

'Five hundred [shekels]' means what is complete. This is clear from the meaning of the number 'five hundred' as what is complete. The reason why 'five hundred' has this meaning is that this number is 
the product of five multiplied by ten tens, or fives times a hundred; and 'five' means much, as do 'ten' and 'a hundred', and therefore 'five hundred' means what is complete.  </p>
<p>'Five' means much, see <a href="5708.htm">5708</a>, <a href="5956.htm">5956</a>, <a href="9102.htm">9102</a>, as likewise does 'ten', <a href="3107.htm">3107</a>, <a href="4638.htm">4638</a>, and also 'a hundred', <a href="4400.htm">4400</a>, <a href="6582.htm">6582</a>, <a href="6594.htm">6594</a>.  All numbers in the Word mean spiritual realities, see in the places referred to in <a href="9488.htm">9488</a>.  Compound numbers 
have a similar meaning to the simple ones that give rise to them through multiplication, <a href="5291.htm">5291</a>, <a href="5335.htm">5335</a>, <a href="5708.htm">5708</a>, <a href="7973.htm">7973</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that numbers mean spiritual realities is perfectly clear in Ezekiel, 
where the house of God, together with everything there inside and outside, and also the new earth or land, are measured and are described by numbers pertaining to measure, in Chapters <a href="40.htm">40</a>-<a href="48.htm">48</a>. By 
the new land there the Church should be understood, and by the house of God its holiness. The same is so in John, in the Book of Revelation, where also a new Jerusalem is described by the numbers where 
measurements are given, by which too a new Church should be understood. Unless the numbers had meant spiritual realities all those measurements would have been pointless.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 'Five hundred' means 
the whole from one end to the other, thus what is complete. This is clear from those chapters in Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
He measured outside the house (or the temple), to the east quarter five hundred rods round 
about, to the north quarter five hundred rods round about, to the south quarter five hundred rods, and to the west quarter<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> five hundred rods. Its wall round about, the length was five hundred rods, 
and the breadth five hundred rods, to distinguish between the holy and the profane. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2042:15-20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 42:15-20</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>From these words it is evident that 'five hundred' means the whole in its entirety, or everything 
holy from one end to the other, thus what is complete; for it says that the wall, which - according to this account of its length and breadth - formed a square, served to distinguish the holy from 
the profane.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 'Five hundred' also means much, while a tenth of that number or fifty means some. This is clear from the Lord's words addressed to Simon, in Luke,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said, There were two 
debtors who had a certain creditor. One owed five hundred denarii, but the other fifty. When they did not have [anything with which] to repay, he forgave them both. Which of the two loves him more? Simon 
answered, The one to whom he forgave more. Jesus said, So have the many sins of the woman been forgiven, because she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, [that person] loves little. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%207:41-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 7:41-end</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The reason why the Lord used those numbers was that they meant much and some; for He spoke from a Divine [perspective], thus used words carrying a spiritual meaning, in accord with correspondences. 
The same is so everywhere else, as when He spoke about the virgins, of whom - He said - there were ten, and that five were wise and five were foolish. He spoke of ten because that number means 
all, that is to say, all who belong to the Church, and of five because this number means some, see <a href="4637.htm">4637</a>, <a href="4638.htm">4638</a>.

`Quingenta': quod significet plenum, constat ex significatione numeri `quingenta' quod sint plenum; quod `quingenta' sint plenum, est quia is numerus componitur ex quinque et decem in se bis multiplicatis, 
{1}seu ex quinquies centum; et per `quinque' significatur multum, similiter per `decem,' et per `centum,' inde per `quingenta' significatur plenum; quod `quinque' sint multum, videatur n. 5708, 
5956, 9102, pariter `decem,' n. 3107, 4638, tum quoque `centum,' n. 4400, 6582, 6594; quod omnes numeri in Verbo significent res, videatur [2] in locis citatis n. 9488, et quod numeri compositi significent 
simile cum simplicibus, ex quibus per multiplicationem {2}existunt, n. 5291, 5335, 5708, 7973. Quod numeri significent res, constat manifeste apud Ezechielem ubi domus Dei, cum omnibus ibi intus 
et extra, et quoque nova terra, {3}mensurantur, et describuntur per numeros mensurae, xl-xlviii; {4}et per novam terram ibi intelligitur Ecclesia, (c)ac per domum Dei sanctum ejus; similiter apud Johannem 
in Apocalypsi, ubi etiam nova Hierosolyma {5} describitur per numeros mensurae, per quam etiam intelligitur nova Ecclesia; nisi numeri significavissent res, omnes illae mensurationes fuissent 
inanes. Quod `quingenta' significent totum {6}ab uno fine ad alterum, ita plenum, constat ibi apud Ezechielem, [3] 	Mensus est extra domum, seu templum, ad plagam orientis quingentos calamos circumcirca, 
ad plagam septentrionis quingentos calamos circumcirca, ad plagam meridiei quingentos calamos, et ad plagam maris quingentos calamos: murus ejus circumcirca, longitudo quingenti calami, et latitudo 
quingenti calami, ad distinguendum inter sanctum et profanum, xlii 15-20; </p>
<p>ex quibus patet quod `quingenta' sint totum in complexu, seu omne sanctum {7}ab uno fine ad alterum, ita plenum, nam dicitur 
quod murus qui erat illa longitudine et latitudine in quadrato, distingueret inter sanctum et profanum. 	[4] Quod `quingenta' {8} significent multum, (c)et decima ejus pars, seu quinquaginta, respective 
aliquid, constat ex Domini Verbis ad Simonem apud Lucam, 	Jesus dixit, Duo debitores erant cuidam creditori, unus debebat denarios quingentos, alter vero quinquaginta; cum illi non haberent ut 
redderent, ambobus condonavit; uter eorum magis {9}illum diligit? respondit Simon, Is cui plus condonavit; dixit Jesus, Sic remissa sunt mulieri peccata multa, quia amavit multum; cui vero parum remittitur, 
parum amat, vii 41-fin.; </p>
<p>quod Dominus illos numeros adhibuerit, erat quia significabant multum et aliquid, locutus enim est ex Divino, ita per significativa secundum correspondentias; {10}similiter 
ubivis alibi, {11}ut cum de (x)virginibus, quas dixit decem, et quod earum quinque essent prudentes et quinque stultae; decem dixit, quia per illum numerum significantur omnes, nempe qui ab Ecclesia; 
et quinque, quia per (x)hunc numerum significatur aliqua pars: videatur n. 4637, 4638. @1 d seu i hoc est,$ @2 d existunt i sunt$ @3 mensuratur et sic describitur$ @4 nam$ @5 i etiam$ @6
