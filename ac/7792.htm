<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7792节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7792.</strong>出埃及记11:9，10.耶和华对摩西说，法老必不听你们，使我的奇事在埃及地多起来。摩西、亚伦在法老面前行了这一切奇事，耶和华使法老的心坚硬，不打发以色列人离开他的地。<br />“耶和华对摩西说”表告知。“法老必不听你们”表不顺服。“使我的奇事在埃及地多起来”表好叫他们能确证这一事实：他们没有信，而是被邪恶主宰。“摩西、亚伦在法老面前行了这一切奇事”表这些荒凉的阶段和随之对他们陷入邪恶的确证通过从神发出的真理实现。“耶和华使法老的心坚硬”表他们依旧固执。“不打发以色列人离开他的地”表他们不离开那些属于属灵教会的人。</p>

Verses 9, 10. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Pharaoh will not hear you; that My wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt. And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh; and Jehovah made 
firm the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not let the sons of Israel go out of his land. "And Jehovah said unto Moses," signifies information; "Pharaoh will not hear you," signifies no obedience; "that 
My wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt," signifies that they may be confirmed in the fact that they were in no faith, but in evil; "and Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh," 
signifies that these vastations, and the consequent confirmations that they were in evil, were effected by means of truth proceeding from the Divine; "and Jehovah made firm the heart of Pharaoh," signifies 
that they were determined; "and he did not let the sons of Israel go out of his land," signifies that they did not leave those who were of the spiritual church. </p>

made Pharaoh's heart unyielding, and he did not send the children of Israel away from his land. </p>
<p>'And Jehovah said to Moses' means an informing. 'Pharaoh will not hear you' means disobedience. 'So 
that My wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt' means in order that they may receive corroboration that they have had no faith but are ruled by evil. 'And Moses and Aaron performed all these 
wonders before Pharaoh' means that these stages of vastation, and the consequent corroborations that they are ruled by evil, were brought about by the truth emanating from God. 'And Jehovah made Pharaoh's 
heart unyielding' means that they remained obstinate. 'And he did not send the children of Israel away from his land' means that they did not leave those who belonged to the spiritual Church.

Vers. 9, 10.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Non audiet ad vos Pharao; propterea ut multiplicari prodigia Mea in terra Aegypti.  Et Moscheh et Aharon fecerunt omnia prodigia illa coram Pharaone; et obfirmavit 
Jehovah cor Pharaonis, et non dimisit filios Israelis e terra sua.  `Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen' significat informationem: `Non audiet ad vos Pharao' significat non oboedientiam: `propterea 
ut multiplicari prodigia Mea in terra Aegypti' significat ut confirmentur quod in nulla fide fuerint, sed in malo: `et Moscheh et Aharon fecerunt omnia prodigia illa coram Pharaone' significat quod vastationes 
illae, et inde confirmationes quod in malo sint, factae sint per verum procedens a Divino: `et obfirmavit Jehovah cor Pharaonis' significat quod se obstinarent: `et non dimisit filios Israelis 
e terra sua' significat quod non relinquerent illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali. </p>
