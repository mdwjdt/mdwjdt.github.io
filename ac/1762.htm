<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1762.</strong>有些灵人不说话，而是通过施加在我脸上的变化来表达他们内心的情感，并且将他们的观念表现得活灵活现，仿佛他们的思维被赋予可见的形式。他们是通过嘴唇区域的变化，并由此传到脸上而做到这一点的。然后，他们在眼睛周围交流心里的内在观点：若交流真理和对真理的情感，就在左眼周围；若交流良善和对良善的情感，则在右眼周围。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1762.</strong> There are spirits who are mute but have shaped my face to reflect their own opinions, presenting their ideas in such a vivid way that their overall thinking lay open to view in visible form. This they achieved by changes in the area around my lips spreading into my face, and also around my eyes. When they were communicating their more profound thoughts, they worked in the area of my left eye if they were dealing with truth and the desire for truth, and around my right eye if they were dealing with goodness and the desire for goodness. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1762</b></p><p><b>1762.</b>
There are spirits who do not speak, but who have expressed the sentiments of their mind by changes induced on my face, and have presented their ideas so vividly that their thought was thus made manifest 
as it were in a form. This was done by changes about the region of the lips, passing thence to the face; also about the eyes, while they were communicating the interior sentiments of their mind; around 
the left eye when they were communicating truth and affections of truth, and around the right eye when communicating good and affections of good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1762</b></p><p><b>1762.</b>
There are spirits who do not use speech but who have expressed their feelings by means of changes imposed on my own face. They presented their ideas so vividly that their thought was consequently given 
visible form so to speak. This was achieved by means of variations around the region of the lips, passing from there to the face, and then, when communicating their interior feelings, around the eyes 
- around the left eye when communicating truths and affections for truth, around the right when communicating goods and affections for good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1762</b>
</p><b>1762.</b>
Sunt spiritus qui non loquuntur, sed per mutationes inductas faciei meae expresserunt sensa animi sui, et stiterunt ideas ita vive ut pateret inde cogitatio eorum quasi in forma; hoc factum per variationes 
circumcirca regionem labiorum, et inde in faciem, tum circumcirca oculos, dum interiora animi sui sensa communicabant, circum sinistrum oculum cum vera affectiones veri, circum dextrum cum bona 
et affectiones boni. </p>
