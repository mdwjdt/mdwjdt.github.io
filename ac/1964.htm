<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1964节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1964.</strong>“夏甲给亚伯兰生以实玛利的时候”表记忆知识情感的生命生出理性的时候。这从“夏甲”和“以实玛利”的含义清楚可知：“夏甲”表记忆知识情感的生命；“以实玛利”表前面所论述的最初孕育的理性。由于本章论述了人类理性，也描述了它唯独由真理构成时的性质，和它由良善和源于良善的真理构成时的性质，故当知道，若没有知识和认知，理性决无可能被孕育和生出，即形成。不过，这些知识和认知必以用为其目的，以用为其目的，就是以生命为其目的，因为一切生命因属于目的而属于用。若非为了属于用的生命学习这些知识，它们毫无价值，因为没有用。<br />当唯独由这些知识和认知构成，而缺乏用的生命时，这理性类似于此处给出的描述：它就象野驴，脾气暴躁，好斗，其生命因对于被我欲所玷污的真理的某种欲望而焦燥干枯。但是，当这些知识和认知以为其目的时，它们就从用获得生命，尽管这生命具有和这用一样的性质。人若为了在爱之信（因为纯正和真实的信仰在于对主之爱和对邻之仁）中变得更完善而学习知识，就处在至高无上的用之中，并从主接受属灵和属天的生命。当处于这种生命时，他们就具有觉察主国度一切事物的能力。所有天使都处于这种生命，并且由于处于这种生命，所以他们也处于聪明本身和智慧本身。</p>

When Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram. That this signifies when the life of the affection of memory-knowledges brought forth the rational, is evident from the signification of "Hagar" as being the life of 
the affection of memory-knowledges; and from the signification of "Ishmael," as being the rational first conceived, treated of above. As in this chapter the subject treated of is man's rational, and 
as there is described the quality of the rational when constituted solely of truths, and also when of goods and of truths derived from goods, be it known that the rational cannot possibly be conceived 
and born, that is, formed, apart from knowledges [scientifica et cognitiones] but these knowledges must have use as their end, and when they have use, they have life as their end, for all life belongs 
to uses, because it belongs to ends, and therefore unless knowledges are learned for the sake of a life of uses, they are of no moment, because of no use.  [2] From these knowledges alone, without 
a life of use, the rational becomes as here described, resembling a wild-ass, morose, pugnacious, and characterized by a parched and dry life, from a kind of love of truth that is defiled with the love 
of self. But when these knowledges have use as their end, they receive life from uses, yet life of such a quality as is that of the uses. They who learn knowledges in order that they may be perfected 
in the faith of love-for true and real faith is love to the Lord and toward the neighbor-are in the use of all uses, and receive spiritual and celestial life from the Lord; and when they are in this 
life, they have a capacity to perceive all things of the Lord's kingdom. In this life are all angels; and because they are in this life they are in intelligence itself and wisdom itself. </p>

'When Hagar bore Ishmael for Abram' means when the life belonging to the affection for knowledge gave birth to the rational. This is clear from the meaning of 'Hagar' as the life belonging to the affection 
for knowledge, and from the meaning of 'Ishmael' as the rational conceived first, dealt with above. Because this chapter has been dealing with man's rational and has described the nature of it 
when composed solely of truths, and the nature of it when composed of goods and of truths derived from goods, it should be recognized that the rational cannot possibly be conceived and born, that is, 
formed, without facts and cognitions. But facts and cognitions must have use as their end in view, and when they do, they have life as their end in view, for all life looks to uses because it looks to 
ends. Unless they are learned for the sake of a life that looks to uses, they are of no value because they have no possible use. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 When composed solely of these, that is to say, of facts and cognitions 
devoid of a life that looks to use, the rational resembles the description given here - it is like a wild ass, ill-tempered, aggressive, whose life is parched and arid from a certain desire for 
truth that is defiled by self-love. But when facts and cognitions have use as the end in view they acquire life from the uses, though the exact nature of that life is the same as that of the use. With 
people who learn cognitions so as to become more perfect in faith grounded in love - for true and real faith consists in love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour- the supreme use of all is 
present and they are acquiring spiritual and celestial life from the Lord. And when that life exists with them they possess the ability to perceive everything that belongs to the Lord's kingdom. This 
life exists with all angels, and because that life exists with them, so do intelligence and wisdom themselves. </p>

`In pariendo Hagar Jishmaelem Abramo': quod significet cum vita affectionis scientiarum peperit rationale, constat ex significatione `Hagaris' quod sit vita affectionis scientiarum, et ex significatione 
`Ismaelis' quod sit rationale primo conceptum, de quibus supra.  In hoc capite quia actum est de rationali hominis, et descriptum quale est quando solummodo vera illud constituunt, et quale est cum 
bona et ex bonis vera, scientiarum quod rationale nusquam concipi et nasci, seu formari possit absque scientificis et cognitionibus; sed scientifica et cognitiones pro fine habebunt usum, et quando 
usum, pro fine habent vitam, nam omnis vita est usuum quia finium; nisi addiscuntur propter vitam usuum, nullius momenti sunt quia nullius usus; [2] ex solis illis, nempe scientificis et cognitionibus 
absque vita usus, fit rationale sicut descriptum, instar onagri, morosum, pugnax, vitam torridam et siccam habens, ex quadam dilectione veri conspurcati amore sui; at cum pro {1} fine habent usum, tunc 
accipiunt vitam ex usibus, sed {2} talem vitam qualem usus: qui cognitiones addiscunt ut perficiantur in fide amoris, nam (o)vera et ipsa fides est amor in Dominum et erga proximum, illi in omnium 
usuum usu sunt et vitam spiritualem (c)et caelestem accipiunt a Domino, et cum {3} in illa vita, in facultate sunt' percipiendi omnia quae sunt regni Domini; in hac vita sunt omnes angeli, et quia in 
vita illa, in ipsa intelligentia et sapientia sunt. 	@1 i scientifica et cognitiones.$ 	@2 et.$ 	@3 cum in illa vita sunt, rationale illorum in facultate est.$ </p>
