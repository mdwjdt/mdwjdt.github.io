<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1215节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1215.</strong>“各随他们的宗族、口音、陆地、民族”表各随他们的性情，无论具体还是总体，这在前面出现相同句子（10:5）的地方已予以解释，只是顺序不同。论述雅弗的儿子那一节，经文“那些分布于岛上的民族就出于这些人，有自己的陆地，各有各的口音、宗族、民族”表具有内在敬拜的外在敬拜。因此，在那一节，属于教义的事物优先；而在本节，属于习惯风俗或生活的事物优先。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1215.</strong> The meaning of by their clans, by their tongues, in their lands, in their nations, as according to the mentality of each, specifically and generally, was explained above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1215/bible_king-james-version_genesis_10_5" target=_top>5</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1215/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1159" target=_top>1159</a>], where the same words occur, although in a different order. That verse said of Japheth's sons that "from them the islands of the nations dispersed in their lands, each by its tongue, by their clans, in their nations," which symbolized different types of outward worship that had deeper worship within. In that passage, then, the images having to do with doctrine came first, but here those having to do with behavior, or with life, come first. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1215</b></p><p><b>1215.</b>
According to their families, according to their tongues, in their lands, in their nations. That this signifies according to the genius of each, in particular and in general, was explained above (at verse 
5), where the same words occur, but in another order. The subject there was the sons of Japheth, that "From these were dispersed the isles of the nations, in their lands, everyone according to his 
tongue, according to their families, as to their nations," signified external worships in which there was internal. In that passage therefore the things that belong to doctrine take precedence; but 
here those which belong to morals, or to life. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1215</b></p><p><b>1215.</b>
'According to their families, according to their tongues, in their lands, in their nations' means according to the particular and the general character of each one, as was explained at verse 5 above 
where the same words occur, though in a different order. That verse, in dealing with the sons of Japheth, says that 'from them the islands of the nations in their lands were spread abroad, everyone according 
to his tongue, according to their families, as to their nations', which meant forms of external worship that have internal worship within them. In that place therefore things connected with doctrine 
take precedence, whereas here it is those connected with habits and customs or with life. </p>

</p><b>1215.</b>
'Secundum familias suas, secundum linguas suas, in terris eorum, in gentibus eorum':  quod significent secundum cujusvis genium in particulari et communi supra ad vers. 5 explicatum est, ubi eadem verba, 
sed alio ordine; ibi de filiis Japheti, 'Quod ex illis dispersae sint insulae gentium in terris suis, quaelibet juxta linguam suam, juxta familias suas, quoad gentes suas,' per quos significati 
sunt cultus externi in quibus internus, quare in illis praecedunt quae sunt doctrinae, hic autem illa quae sunt morum aut vitae. </p>
