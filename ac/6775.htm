<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6775.</strong>“米甸的祭司有七个女儿”表属于那教会的神圣事物。这从“祭司的女儿”、“米甸”和“七”的含义清楚可知：“祭司的女儿”是指属于教会的事物，“女儿”是指教会（参看<a href="2362.htm">2362</a>，<a href="3963.htm">3963</a>，<a href="6729.htm">6729</a>节），“祭司”是指爱之良善（<a href="1728.htm">1728</a>，<a href="3670.htm">3670</a>，<a href="6148.htm">6148</a>节），因此“祭司的女儿”表示就良善而言的教会；“米甸”是指那些处于简单良善的真理之人，如刚才所述（<a href="6773.htm">6773</a>节）；“七”是指神圣之物（<a href="395.htm">395</a>，<a href="433.htm">433</a>，<a href="716.htm">716</a>，<a href="881.htm">881</a>，<a href="5265.htm">5265</a>，<a href="5268.htm">5268</a>节）。因此，“米甸的祭司有七个女儿”表示那些处于简单良善的真理之人当中属于那教会的神圣事物。可以说那些处于教会的外在，简单地照字义相信圣言，并且各人照自己的理解来相信的人便处于简单的良。他们也照他们所信的来生活，从而处于良善，只是这良善的性质取决于指导他们的真理。这良善将教会的内在带给这些人，但由于他们并未处于内层真理，故所流入的良善会变成某种总体性事物，因而变得模糊；因为属灵之光无法流入具体方面，由此清楚光照事物。这种人在来世照着其取决于真理的良善的性质而拥有被恩赐给他们的天堂。像这样的人就是此处“米甸”所指的人；但严格来说，他们是教会之外那些照其宗教信仰过着一种良善生活的人。</p>

And the priest of Midian had seven daughters. That this signifies the holy things of that church, is evident from the signification of the "daughters of a priest, "as being the things of the church (that 
"daughter" is the church, see n. 2362, 3963, 6729; and that "priest" is the good of love, n. 1728, 3670, 6148; thus by the "daughters of a priest," is signified the church as to good); from the signification 
of "Midian," as being those who are in the truths of simple good (of which just above, n. 6773); and from the signification of "seven," as being what is holy (n. 395, 433, 716, 881, 5265, 
5268). Thus by "the priest of Midian had seven daughters" are signified the holy things of the church with those who are in the truths of simple good. Those are said to be in simple good who are in the 
externals of the church, and in simplicity believe the Word as to its literal sense, each according to his apprehension, and who also live according to what they believe, thus in good such as are their 
truths. The internal of the church flows in with them through good, but as they are not in interior truths, the good that flows in becomes general, thus obscure; for spiritual light cannot there 
flow into the singulars, and thus clearly enlighten things. They who are of this character in the other life have heaven bestowed on them according to the quality of the good from the truths. Such are 
they who are here meant by "Midian;" but in the proper sense they are people out of the church, who live in good according to their religiosity. </p>

'And the priest of Midian had seven daughters' means holy things belonging to that Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'a priest's daughters' as things that belong to the Church, for 'a daughter' 
means a Church, see <a href="2362.htm">2362</a>, <a href="3963.htm">3963</a>, <a href="6729.htm">6729</a>, and 'a priest' the good of love, <a href="1728.htm">1728</a>, <a href="3670.htm">3670</a>, <a href="6148.htm">6148</a>, so that 'a priest's daughters' means a Church so far as its good is concerned; from the meaning of 'Midian' 
as people who are guided by the truths that go with simple good, dealt with just above in <a href="6773.htm">6773</a>; and from the meaning of 'seven' as that which is holy, dealt with in <a href="395.htm">395</a>, <a href="433.htm">433</a>, <a href="716.htm">716</a>, <a href="881.htm">881</a>, <a href="5265.htm">5265</a>, <a href="5268.htm">5268</a>. Thus 
'the priest of Midian had seven daughters' means holy things belonging to the Church among those who are guided by the truths that go with simple good. The people said to be governed by simple good 
are those who keep up the external practices of the Church and who in simplicity take the Word literally, each one believing it according to his own understanding. They also lead lives that accord with 
what they believe, and so are governed by good, depending on the nature of that good, which is determined by the truths that guide them. That good brings an internal dimension of the Church to these 
people, but because they are not guided by truths of a more internal kind, the good entering in becomes something general and accordingly vague, since spiritual light is unable to fall on particular 
aspects and thereby illuminate things distinctly. The kind of people spoken of here have heaven granted to them in the next life as determined by the nature of their good, which depends on their truths. 
People such as these are meant here by 'Midian'; but properly speaking they are those outside the Church who lead a good life in keeping with their type of religion. </p>

`Et sacerdoti Midianis septem filiae': quod significet sancta Ecclesiae illius, constat ex significatione `filiarum sacerdotis' quod sint illa quae sunt Ecclesiae; quod `filia' sit Ecclesia, videatur 
n. 2362, 3963, 6729, et quod `sacerdos' sit bonum amoris, n. 1728, 3670, 6148; ita per `sacerdotis filias' significatur Ecclesia quoad bonum {1}; ex significatione `Midianis' quod sint qui in {2}veris 
simplicis boni, de qua mox supra n. 6773; et ex significatione `septem' quod sint sanctum, de qua n. 395, 433, 716, 881, 5265, 5268; {3}ita per quod `sacerdoti Midianis septem filiae' significantur 
sancta Ecclesiae illorum qui in {2}veris simplicis boni.  In simplici bono dicuntur esse qui in Ecclesiae externis sunt, ac simpliciter credunt Verbo quoad sensum ejus litteralem, quisque secundum suum
