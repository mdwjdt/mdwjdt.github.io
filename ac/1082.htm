<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1082.</strong>创世记9:23 于是闪和雅弗拿件衣服，搭在两人的肩上，倒退着进去，遮盖父亲的赤身；他们背着脸，就看不见父亲的赤身。<br />如前所述，“闪”表内在教会，“雅弗”表与它相对应的外在教会。“他们拿件衣服”表他们对此作出善意的解释。“搭在两人的肩上”表他们竭尽全力这样做。“倒退着进去”表他们不在意错误和堕落。“遮盖父亲的赤身”表他们就这样原谅这些事。“他们背着脸，就看不见父亲的赤身”表这是应该做的，并且不应在意诸如由推理所产生的错误和过失之类的事。</p>

And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and both of them put it on their shoulder and went backward and covered their father's nakedness; and their faces were backward, and they did not see their father's nakedness.<br />Shem, as noted, symbolizes the inner church; Japheth, the corresponding outer church. They took a garment means that they put a good interpretation on the situation. And both of them put it on their shoulder means that they did so with all their might. And went backward means that they paid no attention to errors and perversions. And covered their father's nakedness means that in doing so they excused those wrongs. And their faces were backward, and they did not see their father's nakedness means that this is the proper thing to do, and that we should not concentrate on such wrongs, which are blunders and downfalls resulting from misguided thinking. </p>

Verse 23. And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon the shoulder, both of them, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not 
their father's nakedness. By "Shem" as before said, is signified the internal church; by "Japheth" the external church corresponding thereto; "took a garment" signifies that they interpreted for good; 
"and laid it upon the shoulder, both of them" signifies that they did this with all their might; "and went backward" signifies that they did not attend to the errors and perversions; "and covered 
the nakedness of their father" signifies that they thus excused them; "and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness" signifies that so it ought to be done, and that such things 
as errors and mistakes from reasonings should not be attended to. </p>

Verse 23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment and both of them put it on a shoulder, and went backwards and covered their father's nakedness; and their faces were backwards, and they did not see their 
father's nakedness. 'Shem', as stated, means the internal Church, 'Japheth' the external Church corresponding to it. 'They took a garment' means that they placed a good interpretation on it. 'And both 
of them put it on a shoulder' means that they did so with all the power they possessed. 'And they went backwards' means that they took no notice of errors and perversities. 'And covered their father's 
nakedness' means that in this way they excused those things. 'And their faces were backwards, and they did not see their father's nakedness' means that this is what ought to be done and that no notice 
ought to be taken of such things as errors and faults resulting from reasonings. </p>

Vers. 23.  Et accepit Shem et Japheth vestem, et posuerunt super humero ambo illi, et iverunt retrorsum, et texerunt nuditatem patris tui; et facies eorum retrorsum et nuditatem patris sui non viderunt. 
Per 'Shem' significatur, ut dictum, Ecclesia interna: per 'Japheth' Ecclesia ei correspondens externa: 'quod acceperint vestem' significat quod in bonum interpretati sint: 'et posuerunt super humero 
ambo' significat quod illud omni potentia: 'et iverunt retrorsum' significat quod non attenderent ad errores et perversa: 'et texerunt nuditatem patris sui' significat quod sic ea excusaverint: 'et 
facies eorum retrorsum, et nuditatem patris sui non viderunt' significat quod ita faciendum, et quod non attendendum ad talia quae errores et lapsus sunt ex ratiociniis. </p>
