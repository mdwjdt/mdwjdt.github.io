<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3848节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3848.</strong>“拉班便将女儿拉结给雅各为他的女人”表这时良善与内层真理情感的结合。这从“雅各”和“拉结”的代表清楚可知：“雅各”是指属世层的良善，如前所示；“拉结”是指对内层真理的情感，也如前所示；显然，“将女儿给（雅各）为他的女人”表结合。由于表面上看，良善与真理的一切结合依次从外层进行到内层，最后到至内层，故此处所用的表述是对内层真理的情感，因为情感本身，也就是对真理的情感，是从良善流入的。当属世层的良善与理性真理结合，并由此与理性良善结合时，良善与内在真理情感的结合才第一次产生。这种结合由生了十二个儿子之后的“雅各”来代表，当时他已回到他父母家，对此，容后再述。</p>

And he gave him Rachel his daughter for a woman. That this signifies now the conjunction of good with the affection of interior truth, is evident from the representation of Jacob as being the good of 
the natural, as already shown; and from the representation of Rachel as being the affection of interior truth, as also before shown: that "giving her for a woman" signifies conjunction, is manifest. 
 As all the conjunction of good with truth at first apparently proceeds from exteriors to interiors in order, and at last to inmosts, therefore it is here said the affection of interior truth, for the 
affection itself which is of truth, flows in from good. The conjunction of good with the affection of internal truth takes place for the first time when the good of the natural is being conjoined with 
rational truth, and through this with rational good. This conjunction is represented by Jacob after the birth of his twelve sons, when he returned to the house of his mother and father, concerning 
which hereafter. </p>

'And he gave him Rachel his daughter for his wife' means the joining of good at that point to the affection for interior truth. This is clear from the representation of 'Jacob' as the good of the natural, 
dealt with already, and from the representation of 'Rachel' as the affection for interior truth, also dealt with already; and the 'giving for a wife' clearly means their being joined together. Since 
every joining of good to truth at first seemingly goes in order from exterior things to interior, and at length to inmost, the expression affection for interior truth is therefore used here, for 
the affection itself which is an affection for truth flows in from good. The joining of good to the affection for internal truth first takes place when the good of the natural is joined to rational truth, 
and through this to rational good. This joining together is represented by 'Jacob' after the birth of his twelve sons, when he went back to his mother and father's house, about which more will be 
said later on. </p>

</p><b>3848.</b>
`Et dedit ei Rachelem filiam suam ei in mulierem': quod significet tunc conjunctionem boni cum affectione veri interioris, constat a repraesentatione `Jacobi' quod sit bonum naturalis, de qua prius; 
ex repraesentatione `Rachelis' quod sit affectio veri interioris, de qua etiam prius; quod `dare in mulierem' sit conjunctio, patet.  Quia omnis conjunctio {1}boni cum vero primum apparenter procedit 
ab exterioribus ad interiora ordine, et tandem ad intima, ideo hic dicitur affectio veri interioris, ipsa enim affectio quae est veri, influit a bono; conjunctio boni cum affectione veri interni 
est tunc primum, quando bonum naturalis conjungitur vero rationali, et per hoc bono rationali; haec conjunctio repraesentatur per Jacobum post partum duodecim filiorum, cum rediit ad domum matris 
et patris sui, de qua re in sequentibus. </p>
