<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7359节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7359.</strong>一些灵人从那里来到我这里，朝我的左太阳穴把自己安置下来，在那里向我呼出他们的言语，但我不明白。它在流动时是极其柔和的，我不记得以前经历过比这更柔和的流动，就像最温柔的微风。它先从上面吹在我的左太阳穴和左耳上，从那里又继续吹向我的左眼，又一点一点吹向右眼，然后流下来，尤其从左眼流到唇部；一到达唇部，它就通过嘴进来，从嘴里穿过。事实上，它通过咽鼓管进入大脑。当来自这些灵人的“呼吸”抵达我的大脑时，我明白了他们的言语，这使得我能与他们交谈。我发现，当他们与我交谈时，我的唇在动，我的舌也稍微在动，这是因为内在言语与外在言语之间的对应关系。外在言语由落入被称为耳鼓的耳朵外膜，然后从那里通过耳朵里面的小器官、膜和纤维传入大脑的清晰声音构成。</p>

Spirits from thence came to me, and applied themselves to my left temple, and there breathed on me with their speech, but I did not understand it. It was soft in its flow, nor do I remember ever to have 
perceived a softer, it being like the softest aura. It breathed first upon the left temple, and the left ear from above; and the breathing extended thence to the left eye, and by little and little 
to the right, and then flowed downward, especially from the left eye, to the lips; and when it was at the lips, it entered through the mouth, and by a way within the mouth, in fact by the Eustachian 
tube, into the brain. When the breathing came thither, I then understood their speech, and it was given me to talk with them. While they were talking with me I observed that my lips moved, and my tongue 
also a little, because of the correspondence of interior speech with exterior. Exterior speech is that of articulate sound falling toward the external membrane of the ear, and thence by means of little 
organs, membranes, and fibers, which are within the ear, being conveyed to the brain. </p>

Some spirits once came to me from there and positioned themselves towards my left temple. In that position they breathed their speech onto me, but I did not understand it. It was, as it flowed, rather 
gentle; I had not, so far as I could remember, experienced a gentler flow before. It was like a very gentle breeze. It blew first onto my left temple and the upper part of my left ear, and from there 
went on towards my left eye, and little by little towards my right eye. After that it passed down, especially from my left eye, towards my lips; and on reaching my lips it went into and through my mouth. 
Indeed it went through my Eustachian tube into my brain. When that 'breath' from those spirits reached my brain I then understood their speech, and this enabled me to talk to them. I noticed that 
while they spoke to me my lips were made to move, and my tongue also to a small extent. This happened because of the correspondence of inward speech with outward speech. Outward speech consists of articulated 
sound which falls on the external membrane of the ear, [called the ear-drum,] and is conveyed from there into the brain by means of small organs, membranes, and fibres inside the ear.  </p>

Spiritus inde ad me veniebant et se applicabant sinistro meo tempori et ibi me afflabant loquela, {1}sed illam non intelligebam; {2}erat quoad fluxum molliuscula; molliorem non prius, quantum memini, 
perceperam; erat sicut mollissima aura; afflabat illa primo sinistrum tempus et sinistram autem superne; et afflatus inde pergebat ad sinistrum oculum, et paulatim ad dextrum, et defluebat dein, imprimis 
a sinistro oculo, ad labia, et cum ad labia, intrabat per os et per viam intra os; et quidem per tubam (x)Eustachianam in cerebrum; cum afflatus illuc pervenit, tunc loquelam eorum intellexi, et 
loqui datum est cum illis; observabam, cum loquerentur mecum, quod labia apud me moverentur, et parumper etiam lingua, {3} hoc propter correspondentiam {4} loquelae interioris cum {5}loquela exteriore; 
exterior loquela est soni articulati labentis versus membranam auris externam {6}, et {7}exinde mediis organulis, membranis, et fibris, quae intus in aure, aufertur in cerebrum. 	@1 quam$ 	@2 After
