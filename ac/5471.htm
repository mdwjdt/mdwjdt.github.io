<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5471节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5471.</strong>“他哀求我们的时候，却不肯听”表它不断恳求，却得不到接受。这从“哀求”的含义清楚可知，“哀求”是指恳求；当论述的主题是来自神性的良善流注时，不被疏远的哀求就是被接受的恳求。因为从主流入的良善不断催促，可以说恳求；但对它的接受则取决于这个人。这解释了为何不被疏远的哀求表示不断恳求。由此可知“不肯听”表示不接受。字义论述了许多人，如雅各的十个儿子和约瑟；但内义使得他们全都指向同一个对象。由雅各的十个儿子所代表的外在教会的真理，或属世层里面的真理，是存在于外在人里面的真理；而约瑟所代表的属灵层的属天层是存在于内在人里面的源于神性的真理。圣言的其它历史也一样；这些历史中的人物表示不同的属灵事物，这些事物都指向同一个对象。</p>

When he besought us, and we would not hear. That this signifies its continual entreaty without reception, is evident from the signification of "beseeching," as being entreaty; for beseeching not to be 
alienated, when the influx of good from the Divine is treated of, is an entreaty to be received; because the good which flows in from the Lord is continually urging and as it were entreating, but its 
reception rests with the man. Hence it is that beseeching not to be alienated signifies continual entreaty. From this it follows that "not to hear" signifies not to be received. In the sense of the 
letter a number of persons are treated of, as the ten sons of Jacob and Joseph; but in the internal sense these are treated of in one subject. The truths of the external church or in the natural, represented 
by the ten sons of Jacob, are the truths in the external man; and the celestial of the spiritual, represented by Joseph, is truth from the Divine in the internal man. It is similar with other 
historicals of the Word; for things are what are signified by persons, and the things themselves have reference to one subject. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5471</b></p><p><b>5471.</b>
'When he pleaded with us and we did not hear him' means its constant entreaty without ever gaining acceptance. This is clear from the meaning of 'pleading' as an entreaty; for a plea not to be alienated, 
when the subject is the inflow of good from the Divine, is an entreaty to be accepted. Good which flows in from the Lord is constantly at hand and so to speak entreating; but it is up to the individual 
to accept it. This explains why a plea not to become alienated means a constant entreaty, from which it follows that 'not hearing' means non-acceptance. The sense of the letter refers to a number 
of persons - to the ten sons of Jacob and to Joseph; but the internal sense makes them all refer to the one same subject. The truths known to the external Church or truths present within the natural, 
which are represented by 'the ten sons of Jacob', are the truths present within a person's external man, while the celestial of the spiritual, which is represented by 'Joseph', is truth from the Divine 
present in his internal man. The situation is the same here as it is with historical descriptions in other places in the Word; different spiritual realities are meant by the persons in those descriptions, 
and those realities all have regard to the one same subject. </p>

</p><b>5471.</b>
`In deprecando illo ad nos, et non audivimus': quod significet ejus continuam sollicitationem absque receptione, constat ex significatione `deprecari' quod sit sollicitatio; deprecatio enim ne abalienetur, 
cum agitur de influxu boni a Divino, est sollicitatio ut recipiatur; bonum enim quod a Domino influit, continue instat et quasi sollicitat, sed est apud hominem ut recipiatur; inde est quod `deprecatio 
ne abalienetur' significet continuam sollicitationem; inde sequitur quod `non audire' significet non recipi. In sensu litterae agitur de pluribus, ut de decem filiis Jacobi et de Josepho, sed 
in sensu interno agitur de illis in uno subjecto; vera Ecclesiae externae seu in naturali, quae repraesentantur per `decem filios Jacobi', sunt vera quae in externo {1}homine, et caeleste spiritualis 
quod repraesentatur per `Josephum' est verum a Divino in interno homine; similiter se habet alibi in historicis Verbi, sunt enim res quae significantur per personas, et ipsae illae res spectant unum 
subjectum. @1 i ejus$ </p>
