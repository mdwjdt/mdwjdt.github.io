Verses 5-7. And they journeyed; and a terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob. And Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, 
this is Bethel, he and all the people that were with him. And he built there an altar, and called the place El-Bethel; because there the gods were revealed unto him when he fled from before his brother. 
"And they journeyed," signifies what is continuous; "and a terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob," signifies that falsities 
and evils could not come near; "and Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan," signifies the natural in its former state; "this is Bethel," signifies the Divine natural; "he and all the people 
that were with him," signifies with all that was therein; "and he built there an altar," signifies by sanctification; "and he called the place El-Bethel," signifies a holy natural; "because there 
the gods were revealed unto him," signifies holy truths; "when he fled from before his brother," signifies after truths were set before good. </p>

Verses 5-7 And they travelled on; and the terror of God was on the cities which were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob. And Jacob came to Luz which is in the land of Canaan 
- that is, Bethel - he and all the people who were with him. And he built an altar there and called the place El Bethel, for there the gods were revealed to him, when he was fleeing from before 
his brother. </p>
<p>'They travelled on' means a continuation. 'And the terror of God was on the cities which were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob' means that falsities and 
evils were unable to come near. 'And Jacob came to Luz which is in the land of Canaan' means the natural as it was in the previous state. 'That is, Bethel' means the Divine Natural. 'He and all the 
people who were with him' means with all things there. 'And he built an altar there' means through being made holy. 'And called the place El Bethel' means a holy natural. 'For there the gods were revealed 
to him' means holy truths. 'When he was fleeing from before his brother' means after truths were placed above good. </p>

</p><b>4553.</b>
Vers. 5-7.  Et profecti sunt, et fuit terror Dei super urbe quae circumcirca illos, et non persecuti post filios Jacobi. Et venit Jacob ad Luz, quae in terra Canaan, haec Bethel, ille et omnis populus 
qui cum illo. Et aedificavit ibi altare, et vocavit locum El-Bethel, quia ibi revelati ad illum dii, in fugiendo illo a coram fratre suo. `Profecti sunt' significat continuum: `et fuit terror 
Dei super urbes quae circumcirca illos, et non persecuti post filios Jacobi' significat quod falsa et mala non potuerint accedere: `et venit Jacob ad Luz quae in terra Canaan' significat naturale 
in statu priore: `haec Bethel' significat Divinum Naturale: `ille et omnis populus qui cum illo' significat cum omnibus ibi: `et aedificavit ibi altare' significat per sanctificationem `et voca' locum 
El-Bethel' significat sanctum naturale: `quia ibi revelati ad illum dii' significat sancta vera: </p>
<p>`in fugiendo illo a coram fratre suo' significat postquam vera praelata bono. </p>
