<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7931.</strong>出埃及记12:25-28.将来你们到了耶和华按着应许所赐给你们的那地，就要守这礼。将来你们的儿子问你们说，你们这礼是什么意思？你们就说，这是献给耶和华逾越节的祭。祂使灾殃临到埃及，救我们各家的时候，就越过以色列人在埃及的房屋。于是，百姓俯伏下拜。以色列人就去照耶和华吩咐摩西、亚伦的行，他们就这样行了。<br />“将来你们到了耶和华所赐给你们的那地”表当他们到了主所赐给他们的天堂时。“按着应许”表照着圣言中的应许。“就要守这礼”表由于释放而敬拜。“将来你们的儿子问你们说”表对真理的内在觉知，这觉知属于良知。“你们这礼是什么意思”表当他们进行敬拜时。”你们就说”表思想。“这是献给耶和华逾越节的祭”表由于释放而对主的敬拜。“祂就越过以色列人的房屋”表诅咒远离他们被主所保守在的良善。“在埃及”表当接近邪恶时。“使灾殃临到埃及的时候”表当那些属于教会，却陷入与仁分离之信的人受到诅咒时。“救我们各家”表然而没有可诅咒的事临到他们身上，因为他们被主保守在良善中。“于是，百姓俯伏下拜”表口头和内心的谦卑。“以色列人就去照耶和华吩咐摩西、亚伦的行”表那些属于属灵教会的人顺从神的真理。“他们就这样行了”表由意愿所引发的行为。</p>

And ye shall keep this word for a statute to thee and to thy sons forever. That this signifies that hereafter all this shall be according to Divine order for those who are of the spiritual church, is 
evident from the signification of "keeping this word forever," as being that all this was to be observed hereafter; from the signification of "for a statute," as being according to order (see n. 7884); 
and from the representation of the sons of Israel, as being those who are of the spiritual church (n. 4286, 6426, 6637, 6862, 6868, 7035, 7062, 7198, 7201, 7215, 7223). By "order" is meant that order 
which has been in heaven from the time when the Lord from His Divine Human began to dispose all things in heaven and on earth, which was immediately after the resurrection (Matt. 28:18). According 
to this order, they who were of the spiritual church could then be raised into heaven and enjoy eternal blessedness; but not according to the previous order. For previously the Lord disposed all things 
through heaven; but afterward through His Human which He glorified and made Divine in the world, by which there was such an accession of strength that those were raised into heaven who before could 
not be raised; and also that the evil receded on all sides, and were shut up in their hells. This is the order which is meant. </p>

Verses 25-28 And it shall be, when you come to the land which Jehovah will give you, as He has spoken, that you shall keep this service. And it shall be, when your children say to you, What do you mean 
by this service?<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> that you shall say, This is the Passover sacrifice to Jehovah, because He passed by the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt when He inflicted the plague on Egypt, and delivered 
our houses. And the people bowed, and bowed down. And the children of Israel went and did as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron - so they did. </p>
<p>'And it shall be, when you come to the land which 
Jehovah will give you means when they reach heaven, given them by the Lord. 'As He has spoken' means in accordance with the promise contained in the Word. 'That you shall keep this service' means worship 
because of the deliverance. 'And it shall be, when your children say to you' means the inward perception of truth that belongs to conscience. 'What do you mean by this service?' means when engaged 
in worship. 'That you shall say means thought. 'This is the Passover sacrifice to Jehovah' means worship of the Lord because of the deliverance. 'Because He passed by the houses of Israel' means that 
damnation would stay away from the forms of good in which they were maintained by the Lord. 'In Egypt' means when in close proximity to the evil. 'When He inflicted the plague on Egypt' means when 
those belonging to the Church who had been governed by faith separated from charity were damned. 'And delivered our houses' means that nevertheless nothing damnable touched them because they were maintained 
in good by the Lord. 'And the people bowed, and bowed down' means self-abasement on the lips and in the heart. 'And the children of Israel went and did as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron' 
means that those belonging to the spiritual Church obeyed God's truth. 'So they did' means an act initiated by the will.

1}.  Vers. 25-28.  Et erit quod veneritis ad terram quam dabit Jehovah vobis, quemadmodum locutus est, et custodietis servitium hoc.  Et erit quod dixerint ad vos filii vestri, Quodnam servitium hoc vobis? 
 Et dicetis, Sacrificium Paesach hoc Jehovae, quod praeteriverit praeter domos filiorum Israelis in Aegypto, in infligere Illum plagam Aegypto, et domos nostras liberaverit; et inflexit se populus, 
et incurvavit se.  Et iverunt et fecerunt filii Israelis quemadmodum praecepit Jehovah Moschi et Aharoni, ita fecerunt.  `Et erit quod veneritis ad terram quam dabit Jehovah vobis' significat ad caelum, 
quod a Domino illis: `quemadmodum locutus est' significat secundum promissionem in Verbo: `et custodietis servitium hoc' significat cultum propter liberationem: `et erit quod dixerint ad vos filii 
vestri' significat interiorem perceptionem veri quae conscientiae: `Quodnam servitium hoc vobis?' significat cum in cultu: `et dicetis' significat cogitationem: `Sacrificium Paesach hoc Jehovae' significat 
cultum Domini propter liberationem: `quod praeteriverit praeter domos Israelis' significat quod damnatio aufugeret a bonis in quibus detenti sunt a Domino: `in Aegypto' significat cum in propinquitate 
ad malos: `in infligere Illum plagam Aegypto' significat cum damnati illi qui ab Ecclesia in fide separata a charitate fuerunt: `et domos nostras liberaverit' significat quod usque ad illos, 
quia in bono a Domino, nihil damnabile: `et inflexit se populus, et incurvavit se' significat humiliationem oris et cordis: `et iverunt et fecerunt filii Israelis quemadmodum praecepit Jehovah Moschi 
et Aharoni' significat quod illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali oboedirent vero Divino: `ita fecerunt' significat actum ex voluntate. 	@1 7932 I$ </p>
