<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6054节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6054.</strong>关于灵魂，有人说死后它会继续活着，其实它无非是活在肉体中的这个人自己。也就是说，灵魂就是此人活在世上时通过肉体行动，并赋予肉体生命的内在自我或内层人。当他的内在自我或内层人从肉体当中得以释放时，这个人就被称为一个灵人，然后以一个完整的人形显现。然而，他绝无可能被肉眼看见，只能被灵眼看见。在灵眼面前，他看似一个世人；他有感觉（即触觉、嗅觉、听觉和视觉），这些感觉远比在世上时敏锐得多。他有欲望、渴慕、渴望、情感、爱恋，和他在世上所拥有的一样，但优越得多。他也像在世上那样思考，只是更完美；与其他人交谈。简言之，他在那里的生活和在世时一样，以至于他若不反思他在来世的事实，就只知道他还在世上，我经常听见灵人说到这一点。因为死后生命是世间 生命的延续。这就是人死后活着的灵魂。<br />但为免得由于有关灵魂的猜想和假设，人们全然不知“灵魂”这个词是什么意思，最好说一说人的“灵”，或若你愿意，说一说人的内在自我或“内层人”（interior man）。因为他的灵在那里看上去就像一个人，拥有人所拥有的肢体和器官；事实上，它就是在肉身中的这个人自己。这一事实从人们所看见并在圣言中所描述的天使也明显可知，他们都以人的形式显现。事实上，天上的所有天使都有人的形式，因为主拥有人的形式，祂在复活后多次显为人。一位天使，以及一个人的灵之所以在形式上是一个人，是因为整个天堂从主那里拥有结合成一个人形的能力。这就是为何整个天堂被称为大人，我在众多章节末尾论述了这个大人，以及它与人的各个部位的对应关系。由于主住在天上的每个居民里面，所以每位天使都是天堂的一个形像，也就是说，他拥有最完美的人形。人死后也是如此。<br />我所见过的灵人成千上万，无论有多少，他们在我看来，都和男人、女人一样。其中有些人声称，他们是人，和在世时一样，并补充说，他在肉身生活期间从来不信这等事。许多人感到悲哀的是，对于自己死后的状态，人类活在如此的无知之中，他们如此愚蠢而又空洞地思想灵魂；那些对灵魂有过深入思考的人，大多以为灵魂是一种稀薄的空气；这种想法不可避免地导致疯狂的错误，即：灵魂在死后消散。</p>

As regards the soul of which it is said that it will live after death, it is nothing else than the man himself who lives within the body, that is, the interior man who in this world acts through the 
body, and who causes the body to live. This man, when loosed from the body, is called a spirit, and then appears in a complete human form; yet he cannot possibly be seen with the eyes of the body, but 
only with the eyes of the spirit; and before the eyes of the latter he appears like a man in this world; he has senses (namely, touch, smell, hearing, sight) much more exquisite than in this world; he 
has appetites, cupidities, desires, affections, loves, such as there are in this world, but in a more surpassing degree; he also thinks as in this world, but more perfectly; he converses with others; 
in a word, he is there just as he had been in this world, insomuch that if he does not reflect upon being in the other life, he knows no otherwise than that he is in this world (as I have sometimes 
heard spirits say), for the life after death is a continuation of the life in this world. This then is the soul of man which lives after death.  [2] But lest in consequence of the conjectures and hypotheses 
about it, the word "soul" should give rise to the idea of the unknown, it is better to say man's "spirit," or if you prefer it, the "interior man," for the spirit appears there exactly like a 
man, with all the members and organs belonging to a man, and moreover is the man himself, even in the body. That this is so, is also evident from the angels that have been seen, as recorded in the Word, 
who were all seen in the human form; for all the angels in heaven have the human form, because the Lord has it, who after His resurrection appeared so many times as a man. That an angel, as well as 
the spirit of man, is in form a man, is because the universal heaven has from the Lord the capacity of conspiring into the human form, whence the universal heaven is called the Grand Man of which, and 
also of the correspondence of all things of man therewith, I have treated at the close of many chapters. And as the Lord lives in each one in heaven; and as by influx from the Lord the universal heaven 
acts into each one, therefore every angel is an image thereof, that is, is a form most perfectly human, and so in like manner is a man after death.  [3] All the spirits I have seen, who are thousands 
and thousands, have appeared to me exactly like men; and some of them have said that they are men just as in the world, and they added that in the life of the body they had never believed that it 
would be so. Many were sad because of the ignorance of men about their state after death; and because they think so inanely and emptily about the soul; and because most persons who have thought more 
deeply on the subject have supposed the soul to be a kind of thin air, which idea must needs lead into the insane error that it is dissipated after death. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6054</b></p><p><b>6054.</b>
As regards the soul, which - it is said - goes on living after death, it is nothing else than the actual person living in the body. That is, the soul is the person's inner self acting in the world by 
means of the body and imparting life to the body. When his inner self is released from the body the person is called a spirit and then appears in a completely human form. Yet he cannot be seen at all 
by the eyes of the body, only by those of the spirit, to which he has the same appearance as Someone in the world. He has the senses - touch, smell, hearing, and sight - which are far keener than when 
he was in the world. He has appetites, longings, desires, affections, and loves that are like those he had in the world yet far superior. He also engages in thought as he did in the world, but in a 
more perfect way, and he holds conversations with others. In short his life there is as it was in the world, so much so that if he does not stop to reflect on the fact that he is in the next life, he 
knows no other than that he is in the world, as I have frequently heard spirits say. For life after death is a continuation of life in the world. This then is a person's soul which is alive after death. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
But in order that people may not lose all idea of what the word 'soul' means because of the guessing and speculation about what the soul may be, it is better to speak of a person's spirit or, 
if you prefer, his inner self. For his spirit, seen there, appears just like a person possessing all the members and organs that a person has; indeed it is the actual person In a body. The truth of 
this may also be recognized from the angels seen by people and described in the Word; all appeared in human form. Every angel in heaven possesses the human form, for the Lord, who was seen so many times 
after His resurrection as a person, has that form. The reason why an angel as well as a person's spirit is human in outward form is that the whole of heaven receives from the Lord the disposition to 
combine into a human form, which is why the whole of heaven has been called the Grand Man. (The subject of the Grand Man and the correspondence with it of all the parts of a human being have been dealt 
with at the ends of many chapters.) Also because the Lord lives within each inhabitant of heaven, and through what flows in from the Lord the whole of heaven exerts an influence on each inhabitant, 
every angel is an image of heaven, that is, he possesses a form most perfectly human. So too does a person after death. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 However many the spirits I have seen, thousands upon thousands, they have 
all looked to me exactly like men and women. Some have declared that they are people just as they were in the world, and have added that during their lifetime they had not believed anything of the 
sort. Many have felt sad that the human race lives in such ignorance regarding their state after death and that they think about the soul in such a senseless and futile way, and that most of those who 
have thought more seriously about the soul have visualized it as something like a thin column of air, which has inevitably led to the crazy error that the soul is dissipated after death. </p>

Quod animam attinet, de qua dicitur quod victura post mortem, est illa non aliud quam ipse homo qui vivit in corpore, hoc est, interior homo qui per corpus agit in mundo, et qui dat corpori vivere; 
hic homo dum solutus est a corpore, vocatur spiritus, et apparet tunc prorsus in forma humana; sed nequaquam videri potest oculis corporis verum oculis spiritus, et coram {1}hujus oculis apparet ut homo 
in mundo; habet sensus, nempe tactum, olfactum, auditum, visum, multo exquisitiores quam in mundo; habet appetitus, cupiditates, desideria, affectiones, amores, quales in mundo sed in excellentiore 
gradu; cogitat etiam sicut in mundo sed perfectius, loquitur {2} cum aliis; verbo, est ibi sicut in mundo, usque adeo ut si non reflectat super id quod in altera vita sit, non aliter sciat quam quod 
in mundo sit, quod aliquoties audivi a spiritibus; vita enim post mortem est continuatio vitae in mundo; hoc nunc est anima hominis quae vivit post mortem; [2]sed ne idea cadat in ignotum quid per vocem 
animae propter conjecturalia seu hypothetica de {3}illa, praestat ut dicatur spiritus hominis, aut si mavis, interior homo, nam apparet ibi prorsus ut homo, cum omnibus membris et organis quibus homo, 
et quoque est ipse homo in corpore; quod ita sit, etiam constare potest ab angelis visis de quibus in Verbo, qui omnes in forma humana visi fuerunt; est enim forma humana omnibus angelis in caelo, 
quia est Domino, Qui post resurrectionem (t)toties ut homo apparuit; quod angelus ac spiritus hominis sit homo in forma, est quia universum caelum {4}a Domino habet, ut conspiret in formam humanam, unde 
universum caelum vocatum est Maximus Homo, de quo et de correspondentia omnium quae hominis, cum illo, ad finem plurium capitum actum est, et quia Dominus vivit in unoquovis in caelo, et per influxum 
a Domino universum caelum agit in unumquemvis, {5} idcirco omnis angelus est imago ejus, hoc est, {6} forma perfectissime humana, similiter homo post mortem; [3]omnes spiritus quotcumque vidi, qui 
sunt milleni et milleni, prorsus {7}ut homines mihi visi sunt; et quidam eorum dixerunt quod homines sint sicut in mundo, et {8}adjecerunt quod tale nusquam in vita corporis crediderint; {9} multi contristati 
sunt quod genus humanum in tali ignorantia sit de statu suo post mortem, et quod tam inaniter et vacue cogitent de anima, et quod plerique qui de anima penitius cogitarunt, ipsam ut quoddam 
subtile aereum fecerint, quod non potuisset non inducere in insanum illum errorem quod dissipetur post mortem. @1 ejus$ @2 i etiam$ @3 quibus mox supra$ @4 conspirat$ @5 i ut in imaginem suam$ @6
