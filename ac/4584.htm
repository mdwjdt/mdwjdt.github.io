Verses 16-20. And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was still a tract of land to come to Ephrath; and Rachel brought forth, and suffered hard things in her bringing forth. And it came to pass in 
her suffering hard things in her bringing forth that the midwife said unto her, Fear not, for this also is to thee a son. And it came to pass as her soul was going forth, that she was about to die; and 
she called his name Benoni; and his father called him Benjamin. And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, this is Bethlehem. And Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave; this is the pillar 
of Rachel's grave even to this day. "And they journeyed from Bethel, and there was still a tract of land to come to Ephrath," signifies that now was the spiritual of the celestial ("Joseph" is the celestial 
of the spiritual); "and Rachel brought forth, and suffered hard things in her bringing forth," signifies the temptations of interior truth; "and it came to pass in her suffering hard things in 
her bringing forth," signifies after temptations; "that the midwife said unto her, Fear not," signifies perception from the natural; "for this also is to thee a son," signifies spiritual truth; "and 
it came to pass as her soul was in departing that she was about to die," signifies a state of temptations; "and she called his name Benoni," signifies the quality of this state; "and his father called 
him Benjamin," signifies the quality of the spiritual of the celestial; "and Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath," signifies the end of the former affection of interior truth; "this is 
Bethlehem," signifies in place thereof the resurrection of a new spiritual of the celestial; "and Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave," signifies the holy of the spiritual truth that would rise again 
there; "this is the pillar of Rachel's grave even to this day," signifies the state of the holy forever. </p>

Verses 16-20 And they travelled on from Bethel, and there was still a stretch of land to go to Ephrath; and Rachel gave birth, and suffered severely<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> in giving birth. And it happened in her suffering 
severely,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> in giving birth, that the midwife said to her, Do not be afraid, for this also is a son for you. And it happened as her soul was departing, when she was about to die, that she called his name 
Ben-oni; and his father called him Benjamin. And Rachel died, and was buried on the way to Ephrath, that is, Bethlehem. And Jacob set up a pillar over her grave; this is the pillar of Rachel's grave 
even to this day. </p>
<p>'They travelled on from Bethel, and there was still a stretch of land to go to Ephrath' means the spiritual of the celestial at this point - 'Joseph' being the celestial of the 
spiritual. 'And Rachel gave birth, and suffered severely in giving birth' means the temptations endured by interior truth. 'And it happened in her suffering severely, in giving birth' means following 
temptations. 'That the midwife said to her, Do not be afraid' means perception received from the natural. 'For this also is a son for you' means spiritual truth. 'And it happened as her soul was departing, 
when she was about to die' means a state of temptations. 'That she called his name Ben-oni' means the nature of that state. 'And his father called him Benjamin' means the nature of the spiritual 
of the celestial. 'And Rachel died, and was buried on the way to Ephrath' means the end of the initial affection for interior truth. 'That is, Bethlehem' means a new spiritual of the celestial raised 
up in place of it. 'And Jacob set up a pillar over her grave' means the holiness of the spiritual truth that was to be raised up again there. 'This is the pillar of Rachel's grave even to this day' 
means the state of holiness lasting perpetually.

Vers. 16-20.  Et profecti a Bethel, et fuit adhuc tractus terrae ad veniendum Ephratam; et peperit Rachel, et dura passa in pariendo illam.  Et factum in dura patiendo illam, in pariendo illam et 
dixit illi obstetrix, Ne timeas, quia etiam hic tibi filius.  Et factum in exire animam illius quod moritura, et vocavit nomen illius Benoni et pater illius vocavit illum Benjamin.  Et moriebatur 
Rachel, et sepeliebatur in via Ephrath, haec Bethlehem.  Et statuit Jacob statuam super sepulchrum illius; haec statua sepulcri Rachelis usque ad hodie.  `Profecti a Bethel, et fuit adhuc tractus terrae 
ad veniendum Ephratam' significat quod nunc spirituale caelestis; `Josephus' est caeleste spiritualis: peperit Rachel, et dura passa in pariendo illam' significat tentatione prioris veri: `et 
factum in dum patiendo illam, in pariendo illa' significat post tentationes: `et dixit illi obstetrix, Ne timeas' significat perceptionem e naturali: `quia etiam hic tibi filius' significat spiritu 
verum: `et factum in exire animam illius quod moritura' significat statuam tentationum: `et vocavit nomen illius Benoni' significat quale status illius: `et pater illius vocavit illum Benjamin' significat 
quale spirituale caelestis: `et moriebatur Rachel, et sepeliebatur in Ephrata' significat finem prioris affectionis veri interioris: `haec Bethlehem' significat loco illius resurrectionem 
novi spiritualis caelestis: `et statuit Jacob statuam super sepulcrum illius' significat sanctum veri spiritualis resurrecturi ibi: `haec statua sepulcri Rachelis usque ad hodie' significat statum 
sancti in perpetuum. </p>
