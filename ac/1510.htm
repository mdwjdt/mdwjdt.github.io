<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1510节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1510.</strong>每个灵人，尤其每个灵人社群都有自己的气场，它从其原则和信仰发出。恶魔有恶欲的气场，对他们来说，原则和信仰的气场具有这样的性质：当作用于别人时，它会使真理变得如同虚假，并唤起所有能确证的事物，以便诱导一种虚假是真理，邪恶系良善的信念。<br />我清楚知道：若不相信来自主的真理，人确认假与恶何等容易。这种气场的密度取决于虚假的性质。这些气场决不能与那些持守真理的灵人们的气场共存。若这些气场靠近，就会产生厌恶；倘若允许虚假的气场占了上风，善灵就会陷入试探和苦难。我还觉察过不信的气场，也就是那些不相信被告知的任何事，并且除非让他们亲眼看到，否则几乎什么也不信之人所拥有的气场。还有一种气场则属于那些只相信凭感官所理解的事物之人。<br />我还见过一个穿黑衣的灵人坐在磨坊里，好像在磨面粉。我发现他身边有些小镜子。后来，我看到了一些东西，它们是幻想的产物，但却是空洞的。我想知道他是谁，但他走到我跟前说，他就是坐在磨坊里的那一位；他有这样的观念，即每样东西都只是幻想，没有什么东西是真实的。由于这个原因，他补充说，他变成这个样子。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1510.</strong> Every spirit and to a greater extent every community of spirits has its own aura, formed from and given off by the assumptions and self-deceptions that it has adopted. (Demons have an aura formed by their longings.)<br />By its inherent nature, when one person's aura of assumptions and self-deceptions influences another person, it makes truth appear to be false. It also stirs up all kinds of supportive ideas, so that it convinces the person to accept falsity as true and evil as good.<br />[2] (This fact made it clear to me how easily we can become entrenched in falsity and evil, unless we believe the truth that comes from the Lord.) Such auras are denser or thinner, depending on the nature of the falsities.<br />These auras are completely out of harmony with the auras of spirits who subscribe to the truth. If the two kinds of aura come near each other, war breaks out. If the atmosphere of falsity is permitted to win, the good spirits come into times of trial and anguish.<br />I also perceived an atmosphere of disbelief, in which people accept nothing that is said and scarcely even what is in plain sight. And I perceived the atmosphere of those who believe nothing but what they can grasp with their senses.<br />[3] In addition, I saw someone dressed in dark clothing sitting near a mill, apparently milling flour. At his side appeared a little mirror. Later I saw certain products of his disordered imagination, which were surprisingly wispy. I wondered who he was, but he came to me and said that he was the person sitting by the mill and that he had possessed the idea that absolutely everything was simply a hallucination and nothing was real, which is why he ended up in this position. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1510</b></p><p><b>1510.</b>
Every spirit-and still more every society of spirits-has his own sphere from his principles and persuasions, which sphere is that of his principles and persuasions. Evil genii have a sphere of cupidities, 
and in their case the sphere of principles and persuasions is such that when acting upon another it makes truths to be as falsities and calls forth all things that are confirmatory, so as to induce 
a belief that falsities are truths, and that evils are goods.  [2] This has shown how easily a man may be confirmed in falsities and evils, if he has no belief in the truths which are from the Lord. 
Such spheres are dense in proportion to the nature of the falsities. These spheres can by no means agree with the spheres of spirits who are in truths. If they approach, there arises a repugnance; 
and if by permission the sphere of falsity prevails, the good come into temptation and into anxiety. I have also perceived the sphere of unbelief, which is such that those who are in it do not believe 
anything that is said, and scarcely what is presented to their sight. There is also the sphere of those who believe nothing but what they apprehend by the senses. [3] A certain one was seen by me, 
clothed in something dark, sitting at a mill, as if grinding meal, and at the side were seen little mirrors, and I afterwards saw some things produced by phantasy,, but which were aerial. I wondered who 
he was; but he came to me and said that he was the one who sat at the mill; and that he had such ideas, as that all things whatsoever are only phantasies, and that nothing is real. For this reason 
he had become such as he was. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1510</b></p><p><b>1510.</b>
Every spirit has his own sphere, and every community of spirits even more so, which emanates from the assumptions and the persuasions he has adopted. This sphere is that of his assumptions and persuasions. 
Evil genii possess a sphere of evil desires. The sphere of assumptions and persuasions is such that when it acts on another person it causes truths to be as falsities, and stirs up all things which 
are of a confirmatory nature, so as to induce a belief that falsities are truths, and that evils are goods. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This has made clear to me how easily a person can be confirmed in falsities and 
evils if he does not believe in the truths which come from the Lord. The density of such spheres depends on the nature of the falsities that are present; and those spheres cannot possibly coexist with 
the spheres of spirits who abide by truths. If those spheres draw near, a repugnance arises; and if, because it is permitted to do so, the sphere of falsity prevails, the good enter into temptation and 
into distress. I have also perceived the sphere of disbelief, which is such that those to whom it belongs do not believe anything they are told, and scarcely believe that which they are given to see 
with their eyes. There is also the sphere of those who believe nothing apart from what they apprehend with the senses. </p>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 I also once saw a certain spirit dressed in black who was sitting at a mill 
and, it seemed, was grinding flour. To the side of him I saw little mirrors. Subsequently I saw some things which were the product of delusion but which were airy. I wondered who he was, but he came 
to me and said that it was he who had been seated at the mill, and that he possessed such ideas as that every single thing was the product merely of delusion and that nothing was real, on account of 
which, he added, he had become what he was. </p>

</p><b>1510.</b>
Unusquisque spiritus, et magis unaquaevis societas spiritum suam sphaeram habet ex principiis et persuasionibus captis, quae sphaera e principiorum et persuasionum; genii mali habent sphaeram cupiditatum: 
sphaera principiorum et persuasionum talis est ut cum agit in alium, faciat sicut vera sint falsa, et excitat omnia confirmantia sic ut inducat credere quod falsa sint vera, et mala sint bona: 
[2] inde constare potuit quam facile homo falsis et malis confirmari possit nisi credat veris quae a Domino; tales sphaerae sunt densiores secundum falsitatum naturalium: hae sphaerae nullatenus concordare 
possunt cum sphaeris spirituum qui in veris; si approximant, oritur repugnantia; si sphaera falsi ex permissione praevalet, boni in tentationem veniunt inque anxietatem.  Percepta quoque est sphaera 
incredulitatis, qui talis ut nihil credant quae dicuntur, vix quod iis sistitur videndum: sphaera quoque illorum qui nihil credunt nisi quae sensibus capiunt.  [3] Visus mihi quoque quidam, indutus 
obscuro, sedens ad molam, et quasi molens farinam, et latere visa specula parva, vidi postea quaedam producta ex phantasia sed qui aerea; miratus quis esset, sed venit ad me et dixit quod is esset 
qui ad molam sedit, et quod habuerit tales ideas quod omnia et singula essent modo phantasiae et nihil reale, quare talis factus. </p>
