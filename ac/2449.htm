<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2449节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2449.</strong>“把那些城都毁灭了”表一切真理都与他们分离了，以便他们只有虚假。这从“城”的含义清楚可知，“城”是指教义，因而是指真理，因为真理构成教义（参看<a href="402.htm">402</a>，<a href="2268.htm">2268</a>，<a href="2428.htm">2428</a>节）。经上说它们被“毁灭”了，因为这时虚假取代了真理，此处的情况是，所有真理，以及所有良善都与他们分离了。本节同样论述了良善，因为主题是那些被假与恶所主导的教会中人的最终状态；这就是他们所进入的状态。为了解该状态的性质，现简要描述一下。<br />凡进入来世者都被带回到与其肉身生活一样的生活中；然后，善人所具有的恶与假被分离出去，以便他们可以凭善与真被主提入天堂；而恶人所具有的善与真也被分离出去，以便他们可以凭恶与假被带入地狱（参看<a href="2119.htm">2119</a>节）；这和主在马太福音中所说的一模一样：<br />凡有的，还要加给他，叫他有余；凡没有的，连他所有的也要夺去。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.12.htm">13:12</a>）<br />还有：<br />凡有的，还要加给他，叫他有余；没有的，连他所有的也要夺过来。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.29.htm">25:29</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.18.htm">8:18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路19.24.htm">19:24</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路19.26.htm">26</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可4.24.htm">4:24</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可4.25.htm">25</a>）<br />马太福音中的这些话表同样的事：<br />容这两样一齐生长，等着收割。当收割的时候，我要对收割的说：先将稗子薅出来，捆成捆，好烧掉；惟有麦子要收在我的仓里。收割的时候就是世代的终结，将稗子薅出来用火焚烧，世代的终结也要如此。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.30.htm">13:30</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.39.htm">39</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.40.htm">40</a>）<br />下列经文也表同样的事：<br />网撒在海里，聚拢各种鱼类，拣好的收在器具里，将不好的丢弃了；世代的终结也要这样。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.47.htm">13:47</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.50.htm">50</a>）<br />至于何为“终结”（consummation或译为结局，满了，终止，满盈，完结，末世等），以及就教会而言，它包含类似事件，可参看前文（<a href="1857.htm">1857</a>，<a href="2243.htm">2243</a>节）。<br />恶与假从善人身上被分离出去的原因是，他们不必悬在恶与善之间，而是可以凭善被提入天堂；而善与真从恶人身上被分离出去的原因是，他们无法凭自己所具有的良善引诱正直的人，从而凭他们的邪恶去往地狱的恶人当中。因为在来世，一切思想观念和一切情感是这样交流的：良善在善人当中被交流，邪恶在恶人当中被交流（<a href="1388.htm">1388</a>-<a href="1390.htm">1390</a>节）。所以，若不将善人与恶人分开，就会造成无数闹剧，而且联结起来也是不可能的。然而，一切事物都以异常奇妙的方式被联结起来，在天堂是照着对主之爱和相爱，因而照着信的各种不同被联结起来 （<a href="685.htm">685</a>，<a href="1394.htm">1394</a>节）；在地狱则照着恶欲和由此产生的幻觉的各种不同被联结起来（<a href="695.htm">695</a>，<a href="1322.htm">1322</a>节）。然而，要知道，分离并非完全除去，因为人曾经拥有的东西不会被完全除去。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2449</b></p><p><b>2449.</b>
He overthrew those cities. That this signifies that all truths were separated from them, in order that they might have only falsities, is evident from the signification of "cities," as being doctrinal 
things, thus truths, since these belong to doctrinal things (see n. 402, 2268, 2428); and which are said to be "overthrown" when there are falsities instead of truths, in the present case when all truths 
have been separated from them, as well as all goods, which are likewise treated of in this verse because the subject is the last state of those within the church who are in falsities and evils; 
and this is the state into which they come, concerning the nature of which a few words shall be said. [2] They who come into the other life are all brought again into a life similar to that which they 
had in the body; and then with the good evils and falsities are separated, in order that by means of goods and truths they may be elevated by the Lord into heaven; but with the evil, goods and truths 
are separated in order that by evils and falsities they may be borne into hell (see n. 2119); precisely in accordance with the Lord's words in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Whosoever hath, to him shall be given, that 
he may have more abundance; but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath (Matt. 13:12). And elsewhere in the same: </p>
<p>     Unto him that hath shall be given, that he 
may have abundance; but from him that hath not, shall be taken away even that which he hath (Matt. 25:29; Luke 8:18; 19:24-26; Mark 4:24-25). The same things are also signified by these words in Matthew: </p>
<p> 
    Let both grow together until the harvest; and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat 
into my barn. The harvest is the consummation of the age; as therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so shall it be in the consummation of the age (Matt. 13:30, 39-40). The same 
are also signified by what is said of the net cast into the sea that gathered fishes of various kinds, the good being collected into vessels and the bad cast away; and of its being so at the consummation 
of the age (verses 47 to 50). What the "consummation" is, and that it involves like things as these in regard to the church, may be seen above, n 1857, 2243.) The reason why evils and falsities are 
separated from the good is that they may not hang between evils and goods, but may be elevated by means of goods into heaven; and the reason why goods and truths are separated from the evil is that 
they may not by means of any goods that pertain to them seduce the upright, and also that by means of their evils they may go away among the evil who are in hell. For such is the communication in the 
other life, of all ideas of thought, and of all affections, that goods are communicated among the good, and evils among the evil (n. 1388-1390); so that unless the good and the evil were separated, countless 
mischiefs would result, and moreover all association together would be impossible; when yet all things are most exquisitely consociated, in the heavens according to all the differences of love 
to the Lord and of mutual love, and of the derivative faith (n. 685, 1394); and in the hells according to all the differences of cupidities and of the derivative phantasies (n. 695, 1322). Be it known 
however that the separation is not entire removal, for from no one is that which he has had altogether taken away. </p>

That 'He overthrew those cities' means that all truths were separated from them so that they might possess falsities alone is clear from the meaning of 'cities' as matters of doctrine, and so as truths, 
for truths make up matters of doctrine, dealt with in <a href="402.htm">402</a>, <a href="2268.htm">2268</a>, <a href="2428.htm">2428</a>. These are said to be 'overthrown' when falsities stand in place of truths, here when all truths have been separated from them, 
as well as all goods - goods too being dealt with in this verse, since the subject is the final state of those inside the Church who are governed by falsities and evils.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This also is what their 
state comes to be, which, so that the nature of it may be known, must be described briefly. All who enter the next life are taken back to a life similar to that which they were leading during their 
lifetime., Then in the case of the good evils and falsities are separated so that the Lord may raise these people up by means of goods and truths into heaven; but in the case of the evil goods and truths 
are separated so that those evil ones may be carried away by means of evils and falsities into hell, see <a href="2119.htm">2119</a>, in exact accord with the Lord's words in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
To him who has, it will be given, 
so that he may have more abundantly; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13: 12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere in the gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
To everyone who has, it will be given, so that 
he may have in abundance; but from him who has not, it will be taken away. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2025:%2029&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 25: 29</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%208:%2018;%2019:%2024-26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 8: 18; 19: 24-26</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%204:-24,%2025&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 4:-24, 25</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The same is meant by the following words which appear in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Let 
both grow together until the harvest; and at the time of harvest I will tell the reapers, Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn. The harvest 
is the close of the age. Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at the close of the age. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:%2030,%2039,%2040&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13: 30, 39, 40</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The same point is made in the description of the net thrown 
into the sea gathering fish of various kinds, and how after that the good were sorted into vessels while the bad were thrown away; and this is how it will be at the close of the age, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:%2047-50&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13: 47-50</a>. 
</blockquote>
What 'the close' is and that for the Church it entails events like these, see <a href="1857.htm">1857</a>, <a href="2243.htm">2243</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The reason why evils and falsities are separated in the case of people who are good is that the latter 
may not be left suspended between evils and goods and so that they may be raised up by means of goods into heaven. And the reason why goods and truths are separated in the case of the evil is so 
that they do not lead the upright astray by means of any goods present with them, and so that by means of their evils they may withdraw to the evil in hell. For in the next life such is the communication 
of all ideas comprising thought, and of all affections, that goods are communicated with the good, and evils with the evil, <a href="1388.htm">1388</a>-<a href="1390.htm">1390</a>. Consequently unless separation took place countless harmful things 
would result, in addition to the fact that association together would not otherwise be possible. Yet all things are associated together in a very wonderful way, in heaven according to all the variations 
of love to the Lord and of mutual love, and consequently of faith, <a href="685.htm">685</a>, <a href="1394.htm">1394</a>, and in hell according to all the variations of evil desires and of delusions resulting from these, <a href="695.htm">695</a>, <a href="1322.htm">1322</a>. It 
should be recognized however that separation does not mean complete removal, for nothing anybody has once possessed is totally removed from him. </p>

Quod `evertit urbes illas' significet quod ab illis separarentur omnia vera ut modo falsa iis essent, constat ex significatione `urbium' quod sint doctrinalia, ita vera, nam haec sunt doctrinalium, 
de qua n. 402, 2268, 2428, quae `everti' dicuntur cum falsa pro veris sunt, hic cum separata ab illis omnia vera, tum quoque omnia bona de quibus etiam in hoc versu, quia agitur de statu ultimo eorum 
qui intra Ecclesiam in falsis et malis sunt; status eorum quoque talis fit: ut sciatur qualis, paucis dicendum; [2] qui in alteram vitam veniunt, omnes in similem vitam quam habuerunt in corpore, reducuntur; 
et dein apud bonos separantur mala et falsa, ut per bona et vera eleventur a Domino in caelum; at apud malos separantur bona et vera, ut per mala et falsa ferantur in infernum, videatur n. 2119, 
prorsus secundum verba Domini apud Matthaeum, 	Quicumque habet, dabitur illi, ut abundantius habeat; quicumque vero non habet, etiam quod habet, auferetur ab eo, xiii (x)12: </p>
<p>et alibi apud eundem, 	Habenti 
omni dabitur, ut abundet; ab eo autem qui non habet, auferetur ab eo, xxv (x)29; Luc. viii 18; xix 24-26; 	Marc. iv 24, 25; </p>
<p>quae etiam significantur per haec quae apud Matthaeum, 	Sinite 
una crescere utraque usque ad messem, et erit in tempore messis dicam messoribus, Colligite prius zizania, et colligate {1} ea in fasciculos ad comburendum ea; triticum vero congregate in horreum meum:... 
messis consummatio saeculi est, quemadmodum colliguntur Zizania, et igne comburuntur sic erit in consummatione saeculi, xiii 30, 39, 40: </p>
<p>tum quae dicta sunt de 	Sagena jacta in mare, et varii generis 
pisces contrahente, quod dein colligerentur bona in vasa, et mala foras ejicerentur, et quod sic futurum in consummatione saeculi, ibid. vers. 47-50; </p>
<p>quid `consummatio' et quod simile involvat 
quoad Ecclesiam, videatur n. 1857, 2243.  [3] Causa separationis malorum et falsorum apud bonos est, ne pendeant inter mala et bona, sed ut per bona eleventur in caelum; et causa separationis bonorum 
et verorum apud malos es ne per aliqua bona quae apud eos, seducant probos, utque secedant per mala inter malos qui in inferno; nam talis est communicatio omnium idearum cogitationis et affectionum in 
altera vita, ut bona communicentur cum bonis, mala cum malis, n.  1388-1390, quare nisi separarentur, inde damna innumerabilia, praeter quod aliter nulla consociatio fieret; cum tamen exquisitissime 
omnia consociata sunt, in caelis secundum omnes differentias amoris in Dominum ac amoris mutui, et inde fidei, n. 685, 1394, et in infernis secundum omnes differentias cupiditatum, et inde phantasiarum,
