<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1115节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1115.</strong>上古教会被称作人或亚当，属该教会的人是属天之人，他们远在头顶之上，在那里一起生活在至高无上的幸福中。他们说，鲜少有人到他们这里来，除了时不时有某些来自别处的人，这些人声称自己“来自宇宙”。他们还说，远在头顶之上非因他们高傲自大，乃是为了可以管理那里的人。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1115.</strong> People who had been part of the earliest church, which was called Humankind, or Adam — heavenly people — are high up overhead, where they live together in sublime happiness. They said that others rarely approach them, except for the occasional visitor from elsewhere, or as they put it, from the universe.<br />Their position so high above the head, they added, was not due to inflated pride; on the contrary, the goal was to allow them to govern the people there.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1115/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_8054#subsection-2-2" target=_top>Secrets of Heaven 8054:2</a> and Spiritual Experiences (Swedenborg 1998-2002) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1115/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_3925" target=_top>3925</a> together indicate that "there" refers to an area above the head (heaven being in the form of a single human; see note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1115/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_947" target=_top>947</a>) occupied by some unsavory spirits.

They who were of the Most Ancient Church, which was called Man, or Adam, and were celestial men, are very high above the head, and dwell together there in the greatest happiness. They said that others 
rarely come to them, except some at times, as they expressed it, "from the universe;" and that they were on high above the head not because they were of a lofty spirit, but in order that they might 
govern those who are there. </p>

Those who belonged to the Most Ancient Church, which was called Man, or Adam, and who were celestial people, are very high up overhead, where they live together in supreme happiness. They said that others 
rarely visited them, except from time to time certain people from somewhere different who say that they are 'from the universe'. They also said that they were so high up overhead, not because they 
were haughty but so that they might govern those who were there. </p>

</p><b>1115.</b>
Qui ab Antiquissima Ecclesia quae Homo seu Adam appellata fuit, et caelestes homines fuerunt, sunt supra caput altissime, et ibi simul habitant in summa felicitate; dicebant quod raro alii ad eos veniant, 
nisi aliquoties quidam aliunde, dicentes, ex universo:  et quod ita alte supra caput, non esset ideo quod elato animo sint, sed ut gubernent eos qui ibi. </p>
