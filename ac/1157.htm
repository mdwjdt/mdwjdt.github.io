<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1157节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1157.</strong>创世记10:5.那些分布于岛上的民族就出于这些人，有自己的陆地，各有各的口音、宗族、民族。<br />“那些分布于岛上的民族就出于这些人，有自己的陆地”表源于这些人的更多民族的敬拜；“岛”是指特定地区，因而是指距离内在敬拜更遥远的特定敬拜形式；“陆地”表这些敬拜形式的共同特征。“各有各的口音、宗族、民族”表这些人照着各自的性情分布；“各有各的口音”表照着各自的信仰；“各有各的宗族”表照着他们的正直；“各有各的民族”表总体上的这二者（信仰和正直）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1157.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1157/bible_king-james-version_genesis_10_5" target=_top>Genesis 10:5</a>. From these the islands of the nations dispersed in their lands, each by its tongue, by their clans, in their nations.<br />From these the islands of the nations dispersed in their lands means that the worship of many other nations sprang from them. The islands are particular regions — and so particular types of worship — that were even further removed; the lands are general ones. Each by its tongue, by their clans, in their nations, means each according to its mentality: by its tongue is each according to its way of thinking, by their clans is according to its sense of ethics, and in their nations is in respect to both traits more broadly. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1157</b></p><p><b>1157.</b>
Verse 5. From these were dispersed the isles of the nations in their lands, everyone according to his tongue, according to their families, as to their nations. "From these were dispersed the isles of 
the nations in their lands" signifies that the worships of many nations sprang from these; "isles" are particular regions and thus particular worships which were still more remote from internal worship; 
"lands" are their generals; "everyone according to his tongue, according to their families, as to their nations," signifies that these were according to the genius of each; "according to his tongue," 
is according to the opinion of each; "according to their families," is according to their uprightness; "as to their nations," is with respect to both in general. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1157</b></p><p><b>1157.</b>
Verse 5 From these the islands of the nations in their lands were spread abroad, every one according to his tongue, according to their families, as to their nations. </p>
<p>'From these the islands of the 
nations in their lands were spread abroad' means that the worship of even more nations emanated from these, 'islands' being individual pieces of land, and so individual forms of worship, which were more 
remote still, 'lands' the general features of those forms of worship. 'Every one according to his tongue, according to their families, as to their nations' means that they were ranged according to 
the character of each one, 'according to his tongue' meaning according to each one's individual belief, 'according to their families' meaning according to uprightness, 'as to their nations' meaning as 
regards both belief and uprightness in general. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1157</b>
</p><b>1157.</b>
Vers. 5.  Ex his dispersae sunt insulae gentium, in terris suis, quaelibet juxta linguam suam, juxta familias suas, quoad gentes suas.  'Ex his dispersae sunt insulae gentium in terris suis' significant 
quod plurium gentium cultus ex illis exstiterint; 'insulae' sunt particulares tractus, ita particulares cultus, qui adhuc remotiores fuerunt 'terrae' sunt illorum communia:  'quaelibet juxta linguam 
suam, juxta familias suas, quoad gentes suas' significant quod illa secundum cujusvis genium; 'juxta linguam suam' est juxta opinionem cujusvis; 'juxta familias suas' est juxta probitatem; 'quoad 
gentes suas' est quoad utrumque in communi. </p>
