<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3741节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">大人以及与它的对应关系（续）</h4><br />3741.天国呈现为一个人的形态，因为其中的一切事物都对应于唯一的主，也就是说，对应于祂的神性人身，唯独主是人（参看<a href="49.htm">49</a>，<a href="288.htm">288</a>，<a href="565.htm">565</a>，<a href="1894.htm">1894</a>节）。天堂凭着与主的对应关系，凭着是祂的一个形像和样式而被称为大人。天堂里的一切本质为良善的属天之物和一切本质为真理的属灵之物都出自主的神性。那里的所有天使都是形态，也就是照着对主所流出的神性品质的接受而取了一个形态的实体。被天使所接受的主的这些神性品质就是所谓的属天和属灵之物。因为他们里面的神性生命，连同由此而来的神性之光会显现，并照着他们的接受而被调整。<br />因此，对世人来说，形态和实体也具有类似性质，只是处于较低层级，因为它们更粗糙和综合。这些也是属天和属灵品质的接受形态，这一事实从清晰可见的迹像很明显地看出来。如思维，它流入舌头的器官形态并产生言语；如内心情感，它反映在脸上使人看得见；如意愿，它通过身体肌肉进入行动等等。产生这些效果的思维和意愿是属灵和属天的，而接受它们，并将其付诸实践的形态或实体是物质的。显然，这些物质实体产生形态完全是为了接受属灵和属天的实体。由此明显可知，属灵和属天品质就是物质形态的源头，这类形态若不来自它们，根本就不可能产生。</p>

CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE GRAND MAN AND CORRESPONDENCE THEREWITH.                The heavenly kingdom presents the form of one man, for the reason that all the things therein correspond to the Only 
Lord-that is, to His Divine Human-who alone is Man (see n. 49, 288, 565, 1894). From correspondence with Him, and from being an image and likeness of Him, heaven is called the Grand Man. From the Divine 
of the Lord come in heaven all the celestial things which are of good, and all the spiritual things which are of truth. All the angels there are forms (that is, substances formed according to the 
reception) of the Divine things which are from the Lord. The Divine things of the Lord as received by the angels are what are called things celestial and spiritual, because in them the Divine life, together 
with the Divine light thence derived, come forth and are modified as in their recipients.  [2] From this it is that the forms and material substances with man are also of the same nature, but 
in a lower degree, because grosser and more composite. That these also are forms recipient of celestial and spiritual things, is very evident from signs that are clearly visible; as from thought, which 
flows into the organic forms of the tongue, and produces speech; from the affections of the mind, which present themselves visible in the face; and from the will, which by the muscular forms flows 
into actions; and so on. Thought and will, which produce such effects, are spiritual and celestial, whereas the forms or substances which receive them and carry them into act, are material; and it is 
evident that these latter have been formed altogether for the reception of the former, and thus it is evident that the latter are from the former, and that unless they were from them, they could not have 
come forth such as they are. </p>

THE GRAND MAN AND CORRESPONDENCE WITH IT- continued </p>
<p>The heavenly kingdom resembles one human being since every specific thing in it corresponds to the only Lord - that is to say, to His Divine Human 
- who alone is Man, <a href="49.htm">49</a>, <a href="288.htm">288</a>, <a href="565.htm">565</a>, <a href="1894.htm">1894</a>. By virtue of its correspondence with Him, and of its being the image and likeness of Him, heaven is called the Grand Man. The Lord's Divine is the source in 
heaven of everything celestial, which in essence is good, and of everything spiritual, which in essence is truth. Every angel there is a form, that is, every angel is substance taking a form that is determined 
by his reception of Divine qualities flowing from the Lord. These Divine qualities which are the Lord's and are received by the angels are called celestial and spiritual because Divine life, 
and from this Divine light, manifests itself and is modified in them as the recipients. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In addition therefore the forms and material substances with man too are of a similar nature, though they 
exist in a lower degree since they are grosser and more composite. The fact that these too are recipient forms of celestial and spiritual qualities is quite evident from the plainly visible signs of 
them - for example, from thought which flows into the organic forms of the tongue and produces speech; from the feelings of mind which manifest themselves visibly in the face; or from the will which 
passes through the muscles of the body into actions; and so on. The thought and will which produce these activities are spiritual and celestial entities, whereas the forms or substances which receive 
them and carry them into effect are material. These material substances, it is clear, have been used to produce forms solely for the reception of those spiritual and celestial entities. From this it is 
evident that spiritual and celestial qualities are the source of the material forms, and that if they were not, such forms could not come into being at all. </p>

Continuatio de Maximo Homine et Correspondentia cum illo </p>
<p>Regnum caeleste est instar unius hominis quia singula ibi correspondent soli Domino, nempe Ipsius Divino Humano, Qui solus est Homo, n. 
49, 288, 565, 1894; ex correspondentia, imagine et similitudine cum Ipso caelum dicitur Maximus Homo; ex Divino Domini sunt omnia caelestia quae sunt boni, et omnia spiritualia quae sunt veri, in caelo; 
omnes angeli ibi sunt formae, seu substantiae formatae {1}secundum receptionem Divinorum quae a Domino; {2}Divina Domini recepta apud illos sunt quae vocantur caelestia et spiritualia, cum Divina 
vita ac inde Divina lux in illis ut recipientibus existit et modificatur: [2] inde est quod etiam formae et substantiae materiales apud hominem quoque tales sint, sed in inferiore gradu, quia 
crassiores et magis compositae; quod hae quoque sint formae recipientes caelestium et spiritualium, patet manifeste a signis prorsus visibilibus, ut ex cogitatione quae influit in organicas formas 
linguae et producit loquelam; ex affectionibus animi quae se sistunt videndas in facie; exque voluntate quae per formas musculares fluit in actiones; et sic porro; cogitatio et voluntas, quae illa 
producunt, sunt spiritualia et caelestia, formae autem seu substantiae quae recipiunt illa, et mittunt in actum, sunt materiales; quod hae prorsus ad receptionem illorum formatae sint, constat; inde 
patet quod ab illis sint, et quod nisi {3}ab illis, non tales existere potuerint. @1 ad$ @2 et$ @3 i ea$ </p>
