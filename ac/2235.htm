<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2235节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2235.</strong>“义”与良善相关，“公”与真理相关。这从“公义 ”和“公平”的含义清楚可知。在圣言中，“公义和公平”多次被一起提及，但没有人知道它们在内义上表示什么。就最近似的意义而言，“公义”论及正义，“公平”论及正直。当某事通过良善并照着良知来判断时，正义就会出现；而当它通过法律，因而通过法律的正义要求，并且也照着良知（因为法律将其标准赋予良知）来判断时，正直就会出现。然而，就内义而言，“公义”是指源于良善之物，“公平”是指源于真理之物。良善是属爱与仁的一切事物，真理是属源于爱与仁之信的一切事物。真理从良善得其本质，被称为源于良善的真理，就像信源于爱，因而也是来自公义的公平。<br />这就是“公义和公平”的含义，这可从以下圣言经文清楚看出来。耶利米书：<br />耶和华如此说，你们要施行公平和公义，拯救被抢夺的脱离欺压人的手。祸哉！那以不公义盖房，以不公平造楼的人。你的父亲岂不是也吃、也喝，也施行公平和公义吗？那时他得了福乐。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶22.3.htm">22:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶22.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶22.15.htm">15</a>）<br />“公平”表与真理相关之物，“公义”表与良善相关之物。以西结书：<br />恶人若转离他的罪，行公平公义的事，他所犯的一切罪必不被记念；他行了公平公义的事，必要存活。恶人转离他的恶，行公平公义的事，他必因此而存活。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结33.14.htm">33:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结33.16.htm">16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结33.19.htm">19</a>）<br />此处“公平”同样表信之真，“公义”表仁之善。<br />所以，在阿摩司书：<br />惟愿公平如大水滚滚，使公义如江河滔滔！（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩5.24.htm">5:24</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />耶和华如此说，你们当守公平、行公义，因我的救恩临近，我的公义将要显现。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛56.1.htm">56:1</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />那里的平安没有穷尽。他必在大卫的宝座上治理他的国，以公平公义使国坚定稳固，从今直到永远。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.7.htm">9:7</a>）<br />此处“公平公义”表他们处于信之真与仁之善。<br />耶和华被尊崇，因祂居在高处，祂以公平公义充满锡安。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛33.5.htm">33:5</a>）<br />此处“公平”表信，“公义”表爱，“锡安”表教会。首先提及“公平”，是因为爱经由信而来；但若首先提及“公义”，则因为信源于爱，如何西阿书：<br />我必聘你永远归我为妻，以公义、公平、慈爱、怜悯聘你归我；又以信实聘你归我，你就必认识耶和华。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何2.19.htm">2:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何2.20.htm">20</a>）<br />此处首先提及“公义”，“慈爱”也是如此，“慈爱”是爱的属性。随后提及的“公平”、“怜悯”也是如此，“怜悯”是源于爱的信的属性。这二者被称为“信”或“信实”。<br />诗篇：<br />耶和华啊，你的慈爱上及诸天；你的真理达到穹苍。你的公义好像神的高山，你的公平如同深渊。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗36.5.htm">36:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗36.6.htm">6</a>）<br />此处“慈爱”和“公义”同样是爱的属性，而“真理”和“公平”是信的属性。<br />真理从地上生出；公义从天上俯视。耶和华必赐下良善，我们的地也要多出土产。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗85.11.htm">85:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗85.12.htm">12</a>）<br />此处构成信的真理表“公平”，“公义”表爱或慈爱。撒迦利亚书：<br />我要领他们来，他们必住在耶路撒冷中间。他们要作我的子民，我要凭真理和公义作他们的神。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚8.8.htm">8:8</a>）<br />由此也明显可知，“公平”表真理，“公义”表良善，因为此处以“真理”代替“公平”。同样在诗篇：<br />就是行为完全，作事公义，口说真理的人。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗15.2.htm">15:2</a>）<br />由于信植根于仁，或真理植根于良善，故植根于良善的真理有时被称为“公义的判语”（judgments of righteousness），因而“判语”（judgments）的含义几乎等同于“典章”（precepts）。如以赛亚书：<br />他们天天寻求我，乐意明白我的道，好像行义的民族，不离弃他们神的典章，向我求问公义的判语，喜悦亲近神。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛58.2.htm">58:2</a>）<br />“命令”（precepts）表同样的意思，这一点可见于诗篇：<br />我因你公义的典章，一天七次赞美你。因你一切的命令尽都公义。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗119.164.htm">119:164</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗119.172.htm">172</a>）<br />当主新造人时，经上尤其论到主说，祂“施行公平、公义”。如耶利米书：<br />夸耀的却要因了解我，认识我而夸耀；我是耶和华，在地上施行慈爱、公平、公义；因为我喜悦这些事。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶9.24.htm">9:24</a>）<br />此处慈爱，也就是爱的属性，以“公平、公义”来描述。同一先知书：<br />我要给大卫兴起一个公义的苗裔，祂必掌王权，在地上施行公平和公义。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.5.htm">23:5</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶33.15.htm">33:15</a>）<br />因此，约翰福音上说：<br />我若去，就差保惠师到你们这里来；祂来的时候，要为罪、为义，为审判，指证世人；为罪，是因他们不信我；为义，是因我往父那里去，你们就不再见我；为审判，是因这世界的王受了审判。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.7.htm">16:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.11.htm">11</a>）<br />此处“罪”表一切不信。祂“为义指证”表为违背良善的一切指证，然而，主将人性与神性融合以拯救这个世界，这就是“我往父那里去，你们就不再见我”所表示的。祂“为审判指证”表为违背真理的一切指证，但罪恶会被丢进地狱，以至于它们无法再造成伤害，这就是“这世界的王受了审判”所表示的。一般来说，祂“为罪，为义，为审判指证”表为违背良善与真理的一切指证，因而表仁与信不存在。因为古时，公义与公平（或审判）用来论及主时，表示一切慈爱与恩典；用来论及人时，表示一切仁与信。</p>

That "righteousness" has regard to good, and "judgment" to truth, is evident from the signification of "righteousness," and from the signification of "judgment." In the Word, "righteousness and judgment" 
are many times named together, but what they signify in the internal sense has not yet been known. In the proximate sense "righteousness" is predicated of what is righteous or just [justus], and 
"judgment" of what is right [rectus]. There is what is righteous when anything is judged from good, and this according to conscience; but what is right when anything is judged from the law, and thus from 
the righteousness of the law, thus also according to conscience, because it has the law for its rule. But in the internal sense "righteousness" denotes that which is from good, and "judgment" that 
which is from truth. Good is all that which belongs to love and charity; truth is all that which belongs to the derivative faith. Truth derives its essence from good, and is called truth from good, just 
as faith derives its essence from love, and in the same way judgment from righteousness. [2] That such is the signification of "righteousness and judgment" is evident from the following passages 
in the Word. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Thus saith Jehovah, Execute ye judgment and righteousness, and rescue the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor. Woe to him that buildeth his house in that which is 
not righteousness and his chambers in that which is not judgment. Did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and righteousness? Then he had that which is good (Jer. 22:3, 13, 15), where "judgment" 
denotes the things that are of truth, and "righteousness" the things that are of good. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     If the wicked shall return from his sin, and do judgment and righteousness, all his sins that 
he hath sinned shall not be mentioned unto him; he hath done judgment and righteousness: he shall surely live. When the wicked turns himself from his wickedness, and does judgment and righteousness, 
for these he shall live (Ezek. 33:14, 16, 19), where in like manner "judgment" denotes truth, which is of faith; and "righteousness" good, which is of charity. [3] So in Amos: </p>
<p>     Let judgment 
flow like waters, and righteousness like a mighty river (Amos 5:24). In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Thus saith Jehovah, Keep ye judgment, and do righteousness, for My salvation is near to come, and My righteousness 
to reveal itself (Isa. 56:1). In the same: </p>
<p>     To peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it, with judgment and with righteousness, 
from henceforth and even to eternity (Isa. 9:7), denoting that they are in the truths of faith and in the goods of charity. In the same: </p>
<p>     Jehovah is exalted, for He dwelleth on high; He hath 
filled Zion with judgment and righteousness (Isa. 33:5), where "judgment" denotes faith, "righteousness" love, and "Zion" the church. "Judgment" stands first because love comes through faith; but when 
"righteousness" stands first, it is because the faith is from love, as in Hosea: </p>
<p>     I will betroth thee unto Me to eternity, and I will betroth thee unto Me in righteousness and judgment, and in 
mercy and in compassions; and I will betroth thee unto Me in faith, and thou shalt know Jehovah (Hos. 2:19-20), where "righteousness" stands first, as also "mercy," which are of love; and "judgment" 
follows, as also "compassions," which are of faith from love; both are called "faith" or "faithfulness." [4] In David: </p>
<p>     Thy mercy, O Jehovah, is in the heavens, thy truth reacheth unto the skies 
[aetheres]; Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God, Thy judgments are a great deep (Ps. 36:5-6), where both "mercy" and "righteousness" are in like manner of love, and "truth" and "judgments" 
are of faith. In the same: </p>
<p>     Truth shall spring out of the earth, and righteousness shall look forth from heaven. Yea, Jehovah shall give good, and our land shall yield its increase (Ps. 85:11-12), where 
"truth," which is of faith, denotes "judgment," and "righteousness" love or mercy. In Zechariah: </p>
<p>     I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem, and they shall be 
My people, and I will be their God in truth and in righteousness (Zech. 8:8), from which also it is evident that "judgment" denotes truth, and "righteousness" good; because "truth" is here used in place 
of "judgment." In like manner in David: </p>
<p>     He that walketh perfect, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh truth (Ps. 15:2). [5] As faith is of charity, or as truth is of good, the truths of 
good are occasionally called the "judgments of righteousness;" and thus "judgments" signify almost the same as "precepts;" as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     They will seek Me day by day, and desire to know My ways, 
as a nation that doeth righteousness and forsaketh not the judgment of their God; they will ask of Me judgments of righteousness, they will desire to draw near to God (Isa. 58:2). That "precepts" signify 
the same may be seen in David: </p>
<p>     Seven times a day have I praised Thee because of the judgments of Thy righteousness; all Thy precepts are righteousness (Ps. 119:164, 172). It is especially 
said of the Lord that He "does judgment and righteousness," when He creates man anew as in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth Me, that I am Jehovah 
that doeth mercy, judgment, and righteousness in the earth, for in these things I am well pleased (Jer. 9:24), where mercy, which is of love, is described by "judgment and righteousness." In the same: </p>
<p> 
    I will raise up unto David a righteous offshoot, and He shall reign as King, and shall act intelligently, and shall do judgement and righteousness in the earth (Jer. 23:5; 33:15). [6] Hence 
it is said in John: </p>
<p>     If I go away, I will send the Comforter unto you; and when He is come, He will reprove the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment; of sin, because they believe not 
on Me; of righteousness, because I go unto My Father, and ye shall see Me no more; of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged (John 16:7-11). "Sin" here denotes all unfaithfulness. His "reproving 
in regard to righteousness" means in regard to all that is against good, when yet the Lord united the Human to the Divine to save the world-which is the meaning of "I go unto My Father and ye 
shall see Me no more." His "reproving in regard to judgment" means in regard to all that is against truth, when yet evils were cast down into their hells so as no longer to be able to inflict injury-which 
is meant by the prince of the world being judged. In general, His "reproving in regard to sin, righteousness, and judgment," means that it was in regard to all unfaithfulness against good and truth; 
and thus that there was no charity and faith; for in ancient times by righteousness and judgment were understood, as regards the Lord, all mercy and grace; and as regards man, all charity and faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2235</b></p><p><b>2235.</b>
That 'righteousness' means in regard to good, and 'judgement' to truth, becomes clear from the meaning of 'righteousness' and from the meaning of 'judgement'. Righteousness and judgement are mentioned 
together many times in the Word, but what they mean in the internal sense has not yet been known. In the proximate sense 'righteousness' has reference to that which is righteous, and 'judgement' to 
that which is upright. That which is righteous occurs when something is judged from good, and according to conscience, but that which is upright when it is judged from law, and so from the righteous demands 
of the law, thus also according to conscience since the law gives conscience its standards. In the internal sense however, 'righteousness' is that which stems from good, and 'judgement' that which 
stems from truth. Good is everything that belongs to love and charity, truth everything that belongs to faith derived from love and charity. Truth derives its essence from good, and is called truth 
derived from good, just as faith is derived from love, and so also judgement from righteousness. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That such is the meaning of 'righteousness and judgement' is clear from the following places in 
the Word: In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said Jehovah, Do judgement and righteousness, and deliver the plundered out of the hand of the oppressor. Woe to him who builds his house in unrighteousness, and his upper 
rooms not in judgement! Did not your father eat and drink, and do judgement and righteousness? Then it was well with him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2022:-3,%2013,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 22:-3, 13, 15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Judgement' stands for the things connected with truth, 
'righteousness' for those connected with good. In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
If the wicked man turns away from his sin and does judgement and righteousness, all his sins which he has committed will not be remembered; 
he has done judgement and righteousness; he will surely live. When the wicked turns away from his wickedness and does judgement and righteousness he will live because of these. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2033:%2014,%2016,%2019&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 33: 14, 16, 19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here similarly 'judgement' stands for the truth of faith, and 'righteousness' for the good of charity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Amos, </p>
<blockquote>
Let judgement flow like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%205:%2024&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 5: 24</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the meaning is similar. In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said Jehovah, Keep judgement and do righteousness, for My salvation is near to come, and My righteousness to reveal itself. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2056:%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 56: 1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In 
the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
To peace there will be no end, upon the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it in judgement and righteousness, from now and even for evermore. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%209:%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 9: 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'judgement and righteousness' stands for the existence with them of the truths of faith, and of the goods of charity. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah is exalted, for He dwells on 
high. He has filled Zion with judgement and righteousness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2033:%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 33: 5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Judgement' stands for faith, 'righteousness' for love, 'Zion' for the Church. 'Judgement' is mentioned first because love comes 
through faith; but when 'righteousness' is mentioned first it is for the reason that faith is derived from love, as in Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
I will betroth you to Me for ever, and I will betroth you to Me in 
righteousness and judgement, and in mercy and in compassion,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and I will betroth you to Me in faith, and you will know Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%202:-19,%2020&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 2:-19, 20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'righteousness' is mentioned first, as also is 
'mercy', which are the attributes of love, while 'judgement' is mentioned second, as also is 'compassion', which are the attributes of faith that is derived from love. And both are called 'faith' or 
faithfulness. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In David, </p>
<p>O Jehovah, Your mercy is in the heavens; Your truth reaches up to the skies. Your righteousness is like the mountains of God, Your judgements like the great deep. Ps. 
36: <a href="5.htm">5</a>, <a href="6.htm">6</a>. </p>
<p>Here both 'mercy' and 'righteousness' are in a similar way the attributes of love, while 'truth' and 'judgements' are those of faith. In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
Let truth spring out of the ground, 
and let righteousness look down from heaven. Jehovah will indeed give what is good, and our land will give its increase. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2085:%2011,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 85: 11, 12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'truth', which constitutes faith, stands for judgement, 
and 'righteousness' for love or mercy. In Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will lead them and they will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem, and they will be My people, and I will be their God in truth and in righteousness. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%208:%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 8: 8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From this place also it is evident that 'judgement' is truth and 'righteousness' good, since 'truth' is mentioned here in place of judgement. Similarly in David, </p>
<blockquote>
He who walks 
blameless and performs righteousness and speaks the truth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2015:%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 15: 2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Because faith is grounded in charity, that is, because truth is grounded in good, truths rooted in good are in various 
places called 'the judgements of righteousness', so that 'judgements' has virtually the same meaning as commandments, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Let them seek Me day by day and desire the knowledge of My ways, 
as though a nation that does righteousness and does not forsake the judgement of their God. Let them ask of Me the judgements of righteousness, let them desire the approach of God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2058:%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 58: 2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>That 
'commandments' means virtually the same may be seen in David, </p>
<blockquote>
Seven times in the day I have praised You for Your judgements of righteousness. All Your commandments are righteousness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20119:%20164&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 119: 164</a>, 
<a href="172.htm">172</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>It is said in particular of the Lord that He performs 'judgement and righteousness' when He creates man anew, as in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Let him who glories glory in this, that he understands and knows 
Me, that I am Jehovah who performs mercy, judgement and righteousness in the earth; for in these things I am well pleased. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%209:%2024&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 9: 24</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here mercy, which is an attribute of love, is described as 
'judgement and righteousness'. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
I will raise up for David a righteous branch, and he will rule as king, and act intelligently, and execute judgement and righteousness in the land. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2023:%205;%2033:%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 23: 5; 33: 15</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 Hence the following in John, </p>
<blockquote>
If I go away I will send the Paraclete to you. And when He comes He will convince the world in regard to sin and righteousness and judgement: 
in regard to sin, because they do not believe in Me; in regard to righteousness, because I go away to the Father, and you will see Me no more; in regard to judgement, because the prince of this world 
is judged. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2016:-7-11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 16:-7-11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Sin' here stands for all faithlessness. 'He will convince in regard to righteousness' means in regard to everything that is contrary to good, when yet the Lord united 
the Human to the Divine to save the world, meant by 'I go away to the Father and you will see Me no more'. 'In regard to judgement' means in regard to everything that is contrary to the truth, when yet 
evils were cast down into their own hells so that they could not do harm any more, meant by 'the prince of this world is judged'. In general 'He will convince in regard to sin, righteousness, and judgement' 
means in regard to all faithlessness contrary to good and truth, and so means that no charity and faith exist. For in ancient times righteousness and judgement were used, in reference to the 
Lord, to mean all mercy and grace, but in reference to man all charity and faith.

sensu interno significant, nondum notum est; in sensu proximo justitia praedicatur de justo, et judicium de recto; justum est cum aliquid judicatur ex bono, et hoc secundum conscientiam; rectum autem 
cum judicatur ex lege, et sic ex justo legis, ita quoque secundum conscientiam, quia lex illi pro nomina est; in sensu autem interno est justitia quod ex bono, et judicium quod ex vero; bonum est omne 
quod est amoris et charitatis, verum est omne quod est fidei inde; (m)verum ducit essentiam suam a bono, et vocatur verum ex bono, sicut fides ex amore, ita (o)quoque judicium (c)a justitia.(n)  Quod 
justitia et judicium illa {1} significent, constat ex his locis in Verbo; [2] apud Jeremiam, 	Sic dixit Jehovah, Facite judicium et justitiam; et eripite spoliatum e manu oppressoris:... vae aedificanti 
domum suam in non justitia, et hyperoa sua in non judicio.' pater tuus nonne comedit et bibit, et fecit judicium et 	justitiam? tunc bonum illi, xxii 3, 13, 15; </p>
<p>judicium pro illis quae (o)sunt 
veri, et `justitia' quae sunt boni: apud Ezechielem, 	Si impius reversus fuerit a peccato suo, et fecerit judicium et justitiam,... omnia peccata ejus quae peccavit non memorabuntur ei, judicium et justitiam 
fecit, vivendo vivet; enim revertendo se impio ab impietate sua, et fecerit 	judicium et justitiam, propter illa is vivet,(n) xxxiii 14, 16, 19; </p>
<p>similiter `judicium' pro vero quod est fidei, 
et `justitia' pro bono quod est charitatis: [3] apud Amos, 	Fluat sicut aquae judicium, et justitia sicut fluvius fortis, v 24; </p>
<p>similiter: apud Esaiam, 	Sic dixit Jehovah, Custodite judicium, et facile 
justitiam, quia propinqua salus Mea ad veniendum, et justitia Mea ad revelandum se, lvi 1: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Paci non erit finis, super throno Davidis et super regno Ipsius, ad stabiliendum illud, 
et ad sciendum illud in judicio et justitia, a nunc et usque in aeternum, ix 6; </p>
<p>pro quod in veris fidei, et in bonis charitatis: apud eundem, 	Exaltatus Jehovah, quia inhabitat altum, implevit Zionem 
judicio et justitia, xxxiii 5; </p>
<p>`judicium' pro fide, `justitia' pro amore, `Zion' pro Ecclesia; praecedit judicium quia per fidem amor, at cum praecedit justitia, est quod ex amore fides; sicut apud 
Hosheam, 	Desponsabo te Mihi in aeternum, et desponsabo te Mihi in justitia et judicio, et in misericordia et in miserationibus, et desponsabo te Mihi in fide, et cognosces Jehovam, ii 19, 20; </p>
<p>ubi 
`justitia' praecedit, sicut etiam `misericordia' quae sunt amoris, et sequitur `judicium,' sicut etiam `miserationes' quae sunt fidei ex amore; utcumque vocatur fides seu fidelitas: [4] apud Davidem, 	Jehovah, 
in caelis est misericordia Tua, veritas Tua usque ad aetheres; justitia Tua sicut montes Dei, judicia Tua abyssus magna, Ps. xxxvi 6, 7 [A.V. 5, 6]; </p>
<p>ibi `et' misericordia et justitia similiter 
sunt amoris, ac veritas et judicia sunt fidei: apud eundem, 	Veritas e terra germinet, et justitia e caelo prospiciat; Jehovah dabit bonum, et terra nostra dabit proventum suum, Ps. lxxxv 12, 13 
[A.V. 11, 12]; </p>
<p>ibi veritas quae fidei pro judicio, et justitia pro amore seu misericordia: apud Zachariam, 	Adducam eos, et habitabunt in medio Hierosolymae, et	erunt Mihi in populum, et Ego ero iis 
in Deum in veritate et in justitia, viii 8; </p>
<p>inde etiam patet quod `judicium' sit verum, et `justitia' bonum, quia loco judicii hic veritas: similiter apud Davidem, 	Qui ambulat {2} integer, et operans 
justitiam, et loquens veritatem, Ps. xv 2. [5] Fides quia est charitatis, seu verum quia est boni, inde vera boni passim vocantur `judicia justitiae,' et sic (o)judicia paene simile significant 
ac praecepta, ut apud Esaiam, 	Me die die quaerant, et scientiam viarum Mearum desiderent, quasi gens quae justitiam facit, et judicium Dei sui non derelinquit: interrogent Me judicia justitiae, appropinquationem 
Dei desiderent, lviii 2: </p>
<p>quod praecepta, apud Davidem, 	Septies in die laudavi Te super judiciis justitiae Tuae, omnia praecepta Tua justitia, Ps. cxix 164, 172. (m)De Domino imprimis 
dicitur quod faciat judicium et justitiam, cum {3} hominem e novo creat, ut apud Jeremiam, 	De {4} hoc glorietur qui gloriatur, intelligere et nosse Me, quod Ego Jehovah faciens misericordiam, judicium 
et justitiam in terra quia in illis beneplacet Mihi, ix 23; </p>
<p>ibi {5} misericordia quae est amoris, describitur per `judicium et justitiam' apud eundem, 	Suscitabo Davidi germen justum, et regnabit 
rex, et intelligenter aget, et faciet judicium et justitiam in terra, xxiii 5; xxxiii 15(n) [6] hinc apud Johannem, 	Si abivero, mittam Paracletum ad vos, cumque venerit 	ille arguet mundum de peccato, 
[et] de justitia, et de judicio: de peccato quod non credunt in Me; de justitia quod ad Patrem Meum abeo, et non amplius videbitis Me; de judicio, quod princeps hujus mundi judicatus est, xvi 7-11; </p>
<p>`peccatum' 
ibi pro omni infidelitate; quod `arguet de justitia' est de omni quod est contra bonum, cum tamen Dominus Humanum univit Divino ut salvaret mundum {6}, quod est quod `ad Patrem abeo et 
non videbitis Me amplius'; `de judicio' est de omni quod est contra verum, cum tamen dejecta sunt {7} mala in sua inferna, ut illa non `possint amplius' damnum inferre, quod est quod `princeps mundi 
judicatus est' {8}: in genere quod `arguet de peccato, justitia et judicio' est quod de omni infidelitate contra bonum et verum, ita quod nulla charitas et fides, nam per justitiam et judicium intellecta 
fuit antiquis temporibus quoad Dominum omnis misericordia et gratia, et quoad hominem omnis charitas et fides. 	@1 haec.$ 	@2 Ambulans.$ 	@3 i quia dat omnia quae sunt fidei et amoris.$ 	@4 In.$ 	@5
