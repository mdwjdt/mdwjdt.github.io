<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6313节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6313.</strong>当一个人被提升至更内在的层面时，他便从感官层面的粗鄙暗光进入非常柔和的光中，同时从可耻、污秽之物的流注中退出，更接近公义和公平，因为离与他同在的天使越近，离天堂之光就越近。从感官层面的这种提升是古人，甚至外邦人所熟知的；因此，当心智退离感官层面时，他们的圣贤就说，它进入内在之光，同时进入平安、恬淡的状态和一种天国的极乐之中。他们由此也断定心智是不朽的。人能被提升至更内在的层面，并且被提升得越内在，他所进入的光就越清晰。最终，他被提升至天堂之光，这光无非是来自主的智慧和聪明。三层天堂只照着朝向内在层面的提升，因而只照着光的层级，而非以其它方式来划分。第三层天堂因处于至内层，故处于最大的光，因而处于远远超越低层天堂智慧的智慧之中。</p>

When a man is being elevated toward interior things, he comes out of the gross sensuous light into a milder light, and at the same time is withdrawn from the influx of scandalous and filthy things, and 
is brought nearer to the things that belong to what is just and fair, because nearer to the angels who are with him, thus nearer to the light of heaven. This elevation from sensuous things was known 
to the ancients, even to the Gentiles, and therefore when the lower mind is withdrawn from sensuous things, their wise men said that it comes into interior light, and at the same time into a tranquil 
state, and into a kind of heavenly bliss; and from this they also concluded that the mind is immortal. Man is capable of being elevated still more interiorly, and the more interiorly he is elevated, 
the clearer is the light into which he comes; and at last he comes into the light of heaven, which light is nothing else than wisdom and intelligence from the Lord. The three heavens are distinguished 
in no other way than according to elevations toward interior things, thus also according to degrees of light; the third heaven, being in inmost things, is in the greatest light, thus in a wisdom which 
far surpasses the wisdom of the lower heavens. </p>

When a person is raised up to more internal levels he passes from the dull light on the level of the senses to a quite gentle light. At the same time he is removed from the inflow of what is disgraceful 
or foul and is brought closer to what is just and fair, because he is brought closer to the angels present with him, thus closer to the light of heaven. This raising up from the level of the senses 
was well-known to the ancients, and also to gentiles; and that is why the sages among them have said that when the mind is removed from the sensory level, it comes into inner light and at the same time 
into a state filled with peace and into a kind of heavenly bliss. From this they also made deductions about the immortality of the mind. A person can be raised to even more internal levels; and the 
further he goes, the clearer is the light that he comes into. At length he is raised up into the light of heaven, a light that is nothing else than wisdom and intelligence from the Lord. With the three 
heavens nothing else marks off one from another than the internal levels to which it is raised, and so also the degree of light that it possesses. Because it exists at the inmost levels the third 
heaven is in the greatest light, thus in wisdom far surpassing the wisdom of lower heavens. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 6313</b>
</p><b>6313.</b>
Cum homo elevatur versus interiora, tunc a lumine crasso sensuali venit in lumen mitius, et tunc simul abducitur ab influxu scandalosorum et spurcorum, et adducitur propius ad illa quae justi et aequi 
sunt, quia propius ad angelos qui apud illum, ita propius ad lucem caeli.  Elevatio haec a sensualibus nota fuerat antiquis, etiam gentilibus, quare sophi eorum dixerunt, cum animus abducitur a sensualibus, 
quod veniat in lucem interiorem, (c)ac simul in statum tranquillum, (c)et in beatitudinem quandam caelestem; inde etiam illi de immortalitate animi concluserunt.  Homo adhuc interius potest 
elevari, et quo interius eo in lucem clariorem venit, et tandem in lucem caeli, quae lux non est nisi quam sapientia et intelligentia a Domino.  Tres caeli non aliter distincti sunt quam secundum elevationes 
versus interiora, ita {1}quoque secundum gradus lucis; tertium caelum quia est in intimis, est in maxima luce, ita in sapientia quae multum excedit sapientiam inferiorum caelorum. @1 in$ </p>
