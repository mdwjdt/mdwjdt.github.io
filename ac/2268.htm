<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2268节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2268.</strong>“你就因为少了五个而毁灭全城吗”表人类会因为缺了这少许而灭亡吗？这从“五”和“城”的含义清楚可知：“五”是指一些或少许，如刚才所说的；“城”是指真理，如前面所解释的。就真理而言，人的心智在圣言中被比作“城”，也被称作“城”；而就存在于真理中的良善而言，人的心智被比作那城的居民，也被称作居民，因为它们之间有相似性。若在人的两部分记忆（即内部记忆和外部记忆，参看下文<a href="2469.htm">2469</a>节）和其心智思维中的真理缺乏良善，它们就好比没有居民的城，因此是空的。事实上，论到天使，当人活在对主之爱和对邻之仁中时，他们可以说就居于他的真理中，并注入来自主的善情（即对良善的情感）。因为他们乐于和这样的人同居，即生活在一起。而那些具有某些真理，却没有仁之善的人则截然不同。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2268</b></p><p><b>2268.</b>
Wilt Thou destroy all the city for five? That this signifies shall man perish for the little which is wanting, is evident from the signification of "five" as being a little (as just stated); and from 
the signification of a "city," as being truth, also explained before. In regard to the truths in it the human mind is compared in the Word to a "city," and is also so called; and in regard to the goods 
which are in the truths, it is compared to the inhabitants of the city, and the goods are also so called; for the case as regards these is much the same. If the truths which are in man's memories, 
and in the thoughts of his mind, are devoid of goods, they are like a city without inhabitants, and are in the same way vacant and empty. Nay, even of the angels it may be declared that when a man lives 
in love to the Lord, and in charity toward the neighbor, they dwell as it were in his truths, and insinuate affections of good from the Lord; for they are delighted to dwell thus, that is, to live 
with such men. Very different is it with those who are in some truths, but in no goods of charity. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2268</b></p><p><b>2268.</b>
'Will You for five destroy the whole city?' means, Will mankind perish for the small amount that is lacking? This is clear from the meaning of 'five' as small, referred to immediately above, and from 
the meaning of 'a city' as truth, also dealt with already. The human mind as regards truths is in the Word compared to and also called 'a city', and as regards the goods that are present within truths 
is there compared to and also called 'the inhabitants'. For a similarity indeed exists, in that if the truths in a person's two memories<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and in the thoughts of his mind are devoid of goods, they are 
like a city that has no residents and so is vacant and empty. Indeed it can also be said of angels that they dwell so to speak in a person's truths and implant affections for good from the Lord when 
that person leads a life abiding in love to the Lord and in charity towards the neighbour, for they are delighted so to dwell, that is, to live, with such persons. It is different in the case of those 
with whom some truths exist but no goods that flow from charity.

</p><b>2268.</b>
`Num disperdes in quinque totam urbem?': quod significet num pro parvo quod deest, peribit homo, constat ex significatione `quinque' quod sit parum, de qua mox supra, et ex significatione `urbis' quod 
sit verum, de qua etiam prius: mens humana quoad vera, in Verbo comparatur `urbi' et appellatur quoque urbs; et {1} quoad bona quae in veris, comparatur `habitatoribus' ibi et vocantur etiam habitatores; 
similiter enim se habent si vera quae in memoriis hominis, inque mentis ejus cogitationibus, sunt {2} sine bonis, sunt sicut urbs sine incolis, ita vacua et inanis; immo etiam de angelis praedicari 
potest quod habitent quasi in veris hominis, et insinuent affectiones boni a Domino, cum homo in amore in Dominum et in charitate erga proximum vivit; nam ita delectantur habitare, hoc est, vivere 
apud tales homines: aliter apud eos qui in veris aliquibus sunt et in nullis bonis charitatis. 	@1 at.$ 	@2 cogitatione, sint.$ </p>
