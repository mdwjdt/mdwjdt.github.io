<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2447节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2447.</strong>“从天上耶和华那里”表从真理的秩序法则，因为他们使自己与良善分离了。若非通过内义，这一点看不出来。惩罚和定罪的真相通过内义被揭示出来，也就是说，它们决非出于耶和华，即出于主，而是出于这个人自己，恶灵或魔鬼；这也是出于真理的秩序法则，因为他们使自己与良善分离了。<br />一切秩序皆始于耶和华，即始于主。主根据这秩序统治万有，无论总体还是细节。但治理的方式多种多样，也就是说，或许是祂的旨意，或许是祂的美意，或经祂同意，或经祂允许。出于祂的旨意和美意的事皆出于良善的秩序法则，其中有很多事是经祂同意的，也有一些是经祂允许的。但是，人若使自己与良善分离，便将自己丢给属于脱离良善的真理的秩序法则管辖，而这些法则都是诸如诅咒之类的。因为一切真理都定人的罪，并将他扔进地狱；而主出于良善，即出于怜悯拯救他，把他提入天堂。由此可见，正是人自己给自己定罪。<br />经允许所做的事绝大部分具有这种性质，例如，一个魔鬼惩罚并打磨另一个魔鬼，以及诸如此类的无数其它事。这些事出于脱离良善的真理的秩序法则，因为没有别的办法可以约束这类魔鬼，防止他们冲向所有善良正直的人，将他们永远毁灭。防止他们这样做就是主所关注的良善。其中的情形类似于世上有只打算行善的仁慈而富有同情心的国王存在的地方所发生的情形。若这个国王不允许法律惩罚恶人和犯罪的人（尽管他自己不会惩罚任何人，反而会因为他们的罪恶惩罚他们而感到忧伤），那么他会将自己的王国拱手交给这类人来抢掠；这会使严酷无情达到顶点。 <br />这表明，耶和华绝不会降下硫磺与火，也就是说，绝不会诅咒下地狱；而是那些屈服于邪恶和由此产生的虚假之人自己这样做。因为他们使自己与良善分离，从而把自己丢给唯独出于真理的秩序法则管辖。综上所述可推知，这就是这些话的含义。<br />在圣言中，“邪恶”、“惩罚”、“诅咒”、“定罪”，以及诸如此类的很多事都被归给了耶和华或主，如此处我们在以西结书中所读到的，耶和华将火与硫磺如雨般降下：<br />我必用瘟疫和流血的事刑罚他。我也必将火与硫磺如雨般降下。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结38.22.htm">38:22</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />耶和华的气如一股燃烧的硫磺火。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.33.htm">30:33</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />耶和华要密布网罗，将烈火、硫磺如雨般落到恶人身上。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗11.6.htm">11:6</a>）<br /><br />浓烟从祂的鼻孔往上冒，烈火从祂的口中喷出来，连炭也从祂烧着了。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗18.8.htm">18:8</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />免得我的愤怒发作，如火燃起，无人能熄灭。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶21.12.htm">21:12</a>）<br />摩西书：<br />在我怒中有火烧起，直烧到极深的阴间。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.22.htm">32:22</a>）<br />除此之外的类似事出现在很多其它地方。在圣言中，这类事被归给耶和华或主的原因已在第一卷予以解释（<a href="223.htm">223</a>，<a href="245.htm">245</a>，<a href="589.htm">589</a>，<a href="592.htm">592</a>，<a href="696.htm">696</a>，<a href="735.htm">735</a>，<a href="1093.htm">1093</a>，<a href="1638.htm">1638</a>，<a href="1683.htm">1683</a>，<a href="1874.htm">1874</a>节）。这类事出于主的想法距离真相，如同良善距离邪恶，或天堂距离地狱，或神性之物距离魔鬼之物那样遥远。邪恶、地狱和魔鬼才会做这些事；而作为怜悯本身和良善本身的主决不会这种事；不过，由于这些事因所列章节提到的原因而看似出于祂，故它们被归给祂。<br />从本节“耶和华从天上耶和华那里如雨般降与”这句话的字面意义看，祂们似乎有两个，一个在地上，一个在天上。但内义则教导如何理解这个问题，即：所提及的第一个耶和华表主的神圣人性和祂的神圣活动，也就是本章那“两个人”所表示的；而所提及的第二个耶和华则表被称为父的神性本身，前一章提到了祂。内义还教导，这三位一体就存在于主里面，如祂自己在约翰福音中所说的：<br />人看见了我，就是看见了父。相信我，我在父里面，父在我里面。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.9.htm">14:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.11.htm">11</a>）<br />关于神圣活动，同一福音书：<br />保惠师不是凭自己说的，乃是将受于我的传告你们。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.13.htm">16:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.15.htm">15</a>）<br />因此，耶和华只有一位，尽管此处提到了两位。之所以提及两位，是因为秩序的一切法则皆源自主的神性本身、神圣人性和神性活动。</p>

From Jehovah out of heaven. That this signifies from the laws of order as to truth, because they separate themselves from good, cannot be seen except from the internal sense, by which there is disclosed 
how the case stands with punishments and damnations: that they in no wise come from Jehovah, that is, from the Lord, but from the man himself, the evil spirit, and the devil; and this from the laws 
of order as to truth, because they separate themselves from good. [2] All order is from Jehovah, that is, from the Lord, and according to this order are all things directed by Him both in general and 
in particular, but in many different ways, to wit, from Will, from Good-pleasure, from Leave, and from Permission. The things that are from His will and good-pleasure are from the laws of order as 
to good, and so also are many of those which are from leave, and some of those which are from permission. But when a man separates himself from good he casts himself into the rule of the laws of order 
that are of truth separated from good, which are such that they condemn; for all truth condemns man and casts him down into hell; whereas the Lord from good, that is, from mercy, saves him, and uplifts 
him into heaven. From this we see that it is man himself who condemns himself. [3] The things done from permission are mostly of this nature, as for example, that one devil punishes and torments another; 
and innumerable other things of this kind. These things are from the laws of order as to truth separated from good; for the devils could not otherwise be held in bonds, and withheld from rushing 
upon all the well disposed and good, and eternally destroying them. It is the prevention of this which is the good the Lord has in view. The case herein is similar to that which exists on earth, where 
a mild and clement king, who intends and does nothing but good, must needs suffer his laws to punish the evil and the wicked (although he punishes no one, but rather grieves that they are such that 
their evils must punish them), for otherwise he would leave his kingdom itself a prey to them; which would be the height of rigor and of unmercifulness. [4] This shows that Jehovah in no wise caused 
it to rain brimstone and fire, that is in no wise condemned to hell; but that the men themselves who were in evil and thence in falsity did this, because they had separated themselves from good, and 
so had cast themselves into the rule of the laws of order that come from truth alone. From all which it follows that this is the internal sense of these words. [5] That in the Word "evil," "punishing," 
"cursing," "damnation," and many other such things are attributed to Jehovah or the Lord, as here that He made it "rain brimstone and fire," we read in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     I will contend against him with 
pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him fire and brimstone (Ezek. 38:22). In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The breath of Jehovah like a stream of brimstone doth kindle it (Isa. 30:33). In David: </p>
<p>   
  Jehovah shall rain upon the wicked snares, fire, and brimstone (Ps. 11:6). Again: </p>
<p>     There went up a smoke out of His nostrils, and fire out of His mouth, coals did burn from Him (Ps. 18:8). In 
Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Lest My fury go forth like fire, and burn, and there is none to quench it (Jer. 21:12). In Moses: </p>
<p>     A fire is kindled in Mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell (Deut. 32:22); </p>
<p>besides 
similar things in many other places. The reason why such things are attributed in the Word to Jehovah or the Lord has been explained in volume 1 (n. 223, 245, 589, 592, 696, 735, 1093, 
1638, 1683, 1874); for such things are as far from coming from the Lord, as good is far from evil, or as heaven is from hell, or what is Divine from what is diabolical. Evil, hell, and the devil do these 
things; but by no means the Lord, who is mercy itself and good itself; but because He appears to do them, therefore for the reasons mentioned in the numbers cited, they are attributed to Him.  [6] 
From its being said in this verse that Jehovah caused it to rain from Jehovah out of heaven, it appears in the sense of the letter as if there were two; one on earth, and one in heaven; but the internal 
sense teaches how this also is to be understood, namely, that by the Jehovah first named is meant the Lord's Divine Human and Holy proceeding (meant in this chapter by the "two men") and by the Jehovah 
named in the second place is meant the Divine Itself that is called the "Father" (spoken of in the preceding chapter); and that this Trine is in the Lord, as He himself says in John: </p>
<p>     He that 
hath seen Me hath seen the Father; believe Me, that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me (John 14:9-11). And concerning the Holy proceeding, in the same: </p>
<p>     The Comforter shall not speak from 
Himself but He shall take of Mine, and shall declare it unto you (John 16:13-15). Thus Jehovah is one, although two are here named; two being named for the reason that all the laws of order are from 
the Lord's Divine Itself, Divine Human, and Holy proceeding. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2447</b></p><p><b>2447.</b>
'From Jehovah out of heaven' means from the laws of order in regard to truth, because they separate themselves from good. This does not become clear except from the internal sense, by means of which 
the truth of the matter regarding forms of punishment and condemnation is disclosed, namely that the author of these is in no sense Jehovah or the Lord, but man, evil spirit, or devil himself; and this 
is so from the laws of order in regard to truth because they separate themselves from good.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 All order begins in Jehovah, that is, in the Lord, and it is in accordance with that order that He 
rules over every single thing. But there is much variation to His rule; that is to say, it may be His Will, or His Good Pleasure, or His Consent, or His Permission from which He rules. Things that have 
their origin in His will or in His good pleasure are products of laws of order which have regard to what is good, as also do many things that exist by His consent, and even some that do so by His permission. 
But when a person separates himself from good he subjects himself to the laws of order which are those of truth separated from good and which are such as condemn. For all truth condemns a person 
and casts him down into hell; but out of good, that is, out of mercy, the Lord rescues him and raises him up into heaven. From this it is clear that it is a person himself who condemns himself. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
Things that are the result of permission are for the most part of this nature - for example, besides countless others, the fact that one devil punishes and torments another. These things are from 
the laws of order in regard to truth separated from good, for there is no other way in which such devils could be kept under control and prevented from rushing on all the good and upright and destroying 
them eternally. The prevention of their doing this is the good which the Lord has in view. This is similar to what happens on earth where a benign and compassionate ruler exists who intends and 
does nothing but good. If he did not allow his laws to punish evil and criminal persons - though he himself punishes nobody but instead grieves that those people are such that their evils must punish 
them - he would leave his kingdom itself open to plunder by such people; and this would be a manifestation of a complete lack of benignity and compassion. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 From these considerations it is evident 
that Jehovah in no way rained down brimstone and fire, that is, condemned to hell, but that those subject to evil and to falsity which arises out of this did so, the reason being that they separated 
themselves from good and in so doing put themselves under the laws of order deriving from truth alone. From all this it follows that such is the internal sense of these words. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In the Word, evil, 
punishment, cursing, condemnation, and many other things are attributed to Jehovah or the Lord, similar to the attribution here that He rained brimstone and fire: in Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
I will dispute with 
him with pestilence and blood; fire and brimstone will I rain on him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2038:%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 38: 22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The breath of Jehovah is like a stream of burning brimstone. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2030:%2033&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 30: 33</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah 
will rain on the wicked snares, fire and brimstone. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2011:%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 11: 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
Smoke went up out of His nose, and fire out of His mouth devoured; glowing coals flamed forth from Him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2018:%208,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 18: 8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Lest My wrath go forth like fire, and burn with none to quench it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2021:%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 21: 12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Moses, </p>
<p>Fire has flared up in My anger, and will burn right down to the lowest hell. Deut. 
32: <a href="22.htm">22</a>. </p>
<p>Similar attributions occur in many other places besides these. Why in the Word such things are attributed, as has been stated, to Jehovah or the Lord has been explained in Volume One, 
in <a href="223.htm">223</a>, <a href="245.htm">245</a>, <a href="589.htm">589</a>, <a href="592.htm">592</a>, <a href="696.htm">696</a>, <a href="735.htm">735</a>, <a href="1093.htm">1093</a>, <a href="1683.htm">1683</a>, <a href="1874.htm">1874</a>. The idea that such things come from the Lord is as remote from the truth as good is from evil, or heaven from hell, or what is Divine from what is of 
the devil. Evil, hell, and the devil do those things, and in no way the Lord who is mercy itself and good itself. But because those things do seem to come from Him, for reasons presented in the paragraphs 
just quoted, they are attributed to Him. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 From the wording of this verse, 'Jehovah rained from Jehovah out of heaven', it seems in the sense of the letter as though there were two of Them 
- one on earth, and one in heaven. But the internal sense teaches how this matter is to be understood, namely as follows: The Jehovah mentioned first means the Lord's Divine Human and His Holy proceeding, 
which in this chapter are meant by 'the two men', while the Jehovah mentioned second means the Divine itself, called the Father, who is referred to in the previous chapter. The internal sense also 
teaches that this Trinity exists within the Lord, as He Himself says in John, </p>
<blockquote>
He who has seen Me has seen the Father. Believe Me that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:-9-11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:-9-11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And 
referring to the Holy proceeding He says in the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
The Paraclete will not speak from Himself. He will receive it from what is Mine and declare it to you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2016:-13-15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 16:-13-15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Thus there 
is but one Jehovah even though two are mentioned here. Two are mentioned because all laws of order spring from the Lord's Divine itself, Divine Human, and Holy proceeding. </p>

</p><b>2447.</b>
Quod `a cum Jehovah e caelo' significet quod ex legibus ordinis quoad verum, quia se separant a bono, non constare potest nisi a sensu interno, per quem detegitur quomodo se habet cum punitionibus et 
damnationibus, quod nusquam a Jehovah, hoc est a Domino, veniant, sed ab ipso homine, malo spiritu, et diabolo, et hoc ex legibus ordinis quoad verum, quia se separant a bono: [2] omnis ordo est a Jehovah, 
hoc est, Domino, secundum quem ab Ipso reguntur omnia et singula, sed cum multiplici differentia, nempe ex voluntate, ex beneplacito, ex venia, et ex permissione; quae ex voluntate et beneplacito, 
illa sunt ex legibus ordinis quoad bonum, etiam plura quae ex venia, aliqua etiam quae ex permissione; {1} at cum homo separat se a bono, tunc conjicit se in leges ordinis quae sunt veri separati 
a bono, quae tales sunt ut damnent; nam omne verum damnat hominem et dejicit in infernum, at Dominus ex bono, hoc est, ex misericordia salvat, et attollit in caelum; inde constat quod ipse homo sit, 
qui semet damnat.  [3] Quae ex permissione fiunt, pleraque talia sunt, ut pro exemplo, quod unus diabolus puniat et cruciet alterum, praeter innumerabilia alia; haec sunt ex legibus ordinis quoad verum 
separatum a bono, nam aliter non potuissent in vinculis teneri, nec retineri quin ruerent in omnes probos et bonos, et eos in aeternum perderent; hoc ne fiat, est bonum quod spectatur a Domino; se similiter 
hoc habet ac in tellure, ubi rex clemens et mitis, qui nihil nisi bonum intendit et facit; nisi toleraret quod leges ejus punirent malos et scelestos, tametsi ille neminem punit, sed potius dolet 
quod tales sint ut mala eos punire debeant, ipsum suum regnum in praedam talibus relinqueret, quod summae inclementiae, et summae immisericordiae foret: [4] inde patet quod Jehovah nusquam pluere 
fecerit sulphur et ignem, hoc est, damnaverit ad infernum, sed quod ipsi {2} qui in malo et inde in falso fuerant, id fecerint, ex causa quia se separarunt (c)a bono et sic conjecerunt in leges ordinis 
ex solo vero: inde nunc sequitur quod ille sit sensus internus horum verborum.  [5] Quod in Verbo tribuatur Jehovae seu Domino, malum, punitio, maledictio, damnatio, et plura, ut hic quod `pluere fecit 
sulphur et ignem': apud Ezechielem, 	Disceptabo cum eo peste et sanguine,... ignem et sulphur pluere faciam super eum, xxxviii 22 apud Esaiam, 	Flatus Jehovae sicut flumen sulphuris ardentis, 
xxx 33:  apud Davidem, 	Jehovah pluet super impios, laqueos, ignem et sulphur, Ps. xi 6: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Ascendit fumus e naso Ipsius, et ignis ex ore Ipsius [comedit] prunae arserunt ex Ipso, Ps. xviii 
9, 10 [A.V. 8, 9]: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam, 	Ne exeat sicut ignis furor Meus, et ardeat, et nemo exstinguens, xxi 12: </p>
<p>apud Mosen, 	Ignis accensus in ira Mea, et ardebit usque ad infernum infimum, Deut. 
xxxii 22; </p>
<p>praeter similia multis aliis in locis. Quod talia in Verbo tribuantur Jehovae seu Domino, ut dictum {3}, explicatum est in Parte Prima n. 223, 245, 589, 592, 696, 735, 1093, {4}, 1683, 1874; 
tantum enim abest ut talia a Domino veniant, quantum abest bonum a malo, seu caelum ab interno, seu Divinum a diabolico; malum, infernum et diabolus illa faciunt, nusquam Dominus, Qui est ipsa misericordia, 
et ipsum bonum; sed quia ita apparet, inde ex causis de quibus in locis citatis tribuuntur.  [6] Quod in hoc versu dicatur quod `Jehovah pluere fecit cum Jehovah e caelo' apparet in sensu litterae, 
sicut quod duo essent, unus in terra, et unus in caelo; sed sensus internus docet quomodo etiam hoc intelligendum, nempe quod per Jehovam primo nominatum intelligatur Divinum Humanum et Sanctum 
procedens Domini, i hoc capite intellectum per `duos viros,' et quod per Jehovam secundo nominatum intelligatur Ipsum Divinum quod Pater dicitur, de quo in capite praecedente, tum quod hoc Trinum in 
Domino sit {5}, sicut Ipse dicit apud Johannem, 	Qui vidit Me, vidit Patrem;... credite Mihi, quod Ego Patre, et Pater in Me, xiv 9-11; </p>
<p>et de Sancto procedente, apud eundem, 	Paracletus non loquetur 
a seipso,... ex Meo accipiet et annuntiabit vobis, xvi 13-15; </p>
<p>ita unus Jehovah, tametsi duo hic nominantur; quod duo, est causa quia omnes leges ordinis sunt ex Divino Ipso, Divino Humano, et Sancto
