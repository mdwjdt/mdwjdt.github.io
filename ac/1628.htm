<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1628节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1628.</strong>所有天使在他们的所在之地都有自己的住所，这些住所极其壮观。我曾到过那些地方，有时看到它们，并为之惊奇，还与那里的天使交谈过。它们如此清晰明了，以至于再没有比这更清楚的了。与之相比，世上的住所几乎算不上什么。他们还称世上的那些事物都是死的，不真实；而他们自己的事物则是活生生的，是真实的，因为它们出自主。他们的建筑可以说是建筑艺术的源头，并且具有无穷的变化。他们说，就算给他们全世界所有的宫殿，他们也不会交换自己的东西。石头、泥土和木头所造的东西在他们看来都是死的，而来自主、来自生命本身和光本身之物则是活的；当他们用所有感官来体验它们时，情况更是如此。因为那里所存在的事物完全适合灵人和天使的感官，而灵人以其视觉根本就看不到物质太阳光照下的事物。不过，石、木制成的东西适合活在肉身之人的感官。属灵之物适合属灵人，而肉体之物则适合肉体人。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1628.</strong> All angels have their own houses to live in 钬?magnificent houses. While there, I saw them several times, with astonishment, and spoke with the angels in them. They are so clear to see, so visible, that nothing could be more so. Houses on earth are almost nothing by comparison. Angels also call earthly dwellings lifeless and unreal but their own dwellings alive and genuine, because they come from the Lord. The architecture is such that it is the source of the art itself, with unending variety.<br />They said that if they were given all the palaces in the whole inhabited world, they would not exchange their own for them. Anything made of stone, brick, or plank seems dead to them, but anything from the Lord, or from life and light itself, is alive. Such materials are all the more alive because angels experience them with the full range of senses, since objects there are perfectly suited to the senses of spirits and angels. Objects in the light of the sun's realm are not the least bit visible to spirits' eyes. To the senses we have in our bodies, though, stone and wood are well-suited.{*1} What is spiritual responds to what is spiritual, and what is physical responds to what is physical.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the meaning of the phrase "stone and wood" as physical, concrete matter, see note 1 in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1628/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_622" target=_top>622</a> above.

All the angels have their own dwellings in the places where they are, and they are magnificent. I have been there, and have sometimes seen and marveled at them, and have there spoken with the angels. 
They are so distinct and clearly seen that nothing can be more so. In comparison with these, the habitations on earth amount to scarcely anything. They also call those which are on the earth dead, and 
not real; but their own, living and true, because from the Lord. The architecture is such that the art itself is derived from it, with a variety that knows no limit. They have said that if all the palaces 
in the whole world should be given them, they would not receive them in exchange for their own. What is made of stone, clay, and wood is to them dead; but what is from the Lord, and from life itself 
and light itself, is living; and this is the more the case that they enjoy them with all fullness of sense. For the things that are there are perfectly adapted to the senses of spirits and angels; 
for spirits cannot see at all by their sight the things that are in the light of the solar world; but things of stone and wood are adapted to the senses of men in the body. Spiritual things are in 
correspondence with those who are spiritual, and corporeal things with those who are corporeal. </p>

All angels have their own dwellings in the places where they are, and these are magnificent. I have been to those places; I have seen them frequently, and have been astonished; and I have talked to those 
there. They stand out so clearly and distinctly that nothing can be more clear and distinct. Dwellings on earth scarcely stand any comparison with them whatever. The angels go so far as to declare 
that dwelling places on earth are dead and unreal, whereas their own are alive and true because they come from the Lord. Their architecture is such as to be the source of the art of architecture; and 
it is endlessly varied. They have said that if they were offered all the palaces existing in the whole world they would not exchange them for their own. So far as they are concerned, what is made of 
stone, clay, or wood is dead, whereas what derives from the Lord, and from life itself and light itself, is alive - the more so since they experience them with all of their senses. For what exists there 
is utterly appropriate to the senses of spirits and angels, while what is illuminated by the physical sun they cannot see at all with their own sight. Things made of stone and wood however are appropriate 
to the senses men possess while they live in the physical body. Spiritual things go with spiritual, and physical with physical. </p>

</p><b>1628.</b>
Omnes angeli habent sua habitacula ubi sunt, quae sunt magnifica; fui ibi, et vidi aliquoties, et miratus, et ibi cum illis locutus; sunt tam manifesta et conspicua ut non dari queat magis manifestum 
et conspicuum; habitacula in terris vix quicquam sunt respective; vocant etiam ea quae sunt in tellure mortua et non realia, sed sua viva et vera, quia a Domino; architectura est talis ut ipsa ars inde, 
cum indefinita varietate; dixerunt, si darentur illis omnia palatia in universo terrarum orbe, pro suo non mutarent; quod lapideum, luteum et ligneum illis est mortuum, at quod a Domino, ipsaque 
vita et luce, est vivum, et eo magis quia illis omni sensu fruuntur; nam quae ibi, prorsus adaequata sunt sensibus spirituum et angelorum, quae enim in luce mundi solaris spiritus ne hilum videre possunt 
suo visu; lapidea vero et lignea adaequata sunt sensibus hominum in corpore; spiritualia spiritualibus correspondent, et corporea corporeis. </p>
