<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8101节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8101.</strong>出埃及记13:19.摩西把约瑟的骸骨一同带去，因为约瑟曾叫以色列人严严地起誓说，神必眷顾你们，你们要把我的骸骨从这里一同带上去。<br />“摩西把约瑟的骸骨一同带去”表存在于他们当中的一个教会的代表。“因为约瑟曾叫以色列人严严地起誓说”表一项义务。“神必眷顾你们”表当教会的这最后状态和最初状态即将到来时。“你们要把我的骸骨从这里一同带上去”如前面那样，表在他们当中的，是一个教会的代表，而不是还在更内在层面上存在的一个教会。</p>

Verse 19. And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him; for swearing he had called the sons of Israel to swear, saying, Visiting God will visit you; and ye shall bring up my bones with you from hence. 
"And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him," signifies the representative of a church, which they had; "for swearing he had caused the sons of Israel to swear, saying," signifies a binding; "Visiting 
God will visit you," signifies when this last state and first state of the church would come; "and ye shall bring up my bones with you from hence," signifies as above, the representative of a church 
with them, and not a church, which moreover is in what is internal. </p>

Verse 19 And Moses took Joseph's bones with him, for he had made the children of Israel swear solemnly, saying, God will certainly visit you, and you shall cause my bones to go up from here with you. </p>
<p>'And 
Moses took Joseph's bones with him' means a representative of the </p>
<p>Church which existed among them. 'For he had made the children of Israel swear solemnly, saying' means an obligation. 'God 
will certainly </p>
<p>visit you' means since the end of one period of the Church and the I beginning of the next is about to come. 'And you shall cause my bones to go up from here with you' means, as above, 
a representative of the Church among them but not a Church which also exists on an internal level. </p>

Vers. 19.  Et accepit Moscheh ossa Josephi secum, quia adjurando adjuravit filios Israelis, dicendo, Visitando visitabit Deus vos, et ascendere facietis ossa mea exhinc vobiscum.  `Et accepit Moscheh 
ossa Josephi secum' significat repraesentativum Ecclesiae quod illis {1}: `quia adjurando adjuravit filios Israelis, dicendo' significat obstrictionem {2}: `Visitando visitabit Deus vos' significat 
cum id ultimum et primum Ecclesiae venturum: `et ascendere facietis ossa mea exhinc vobiscum' significat, ut supra, repraesentativum Ecclesiae illis, non Ecclesia, quae etiam est in interno {1}. 	@1
