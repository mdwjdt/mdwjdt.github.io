<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10629节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10629</strong>.“又求你赦免我们的罪孽和罪恶”表如此是为了使他们那充满虚假和邪恶的内层可以移开。这从“赦免罪孽和罪恶”的含义清楚可知，当论及敬拜、教会和圣言在这个人民当中所取的外在形式时，“赦免罪孽和罪恶”是指为了使他们的内层可以移开，因为这些内层充满虚假和邪恶。这些话表示这些事，这一点从内义上的思路可推知，就内义而言，所论述的主题是要建立在这人民当中的教会。一个教会不可能建立在任何人民当中，除非他们的内层被打开，由此实现与天堂的联系；而这些内层只有在那些处于源于主、基于生活良善的信之真理的人身上才能打开。但这个人民的内层是无法打开的，因为他们将对耶和华的敬拜仅仅视为获得超越他人的显赫并变得比他人富有的一种手段；因此，他们心里除了自己和世界之外，什么都没有。这些兴趣关闭朝向天堂的内层，并打开朝向地狱的内层。这个民族的内层就是这样，当他们进行敬拜时，这些内层就关闭（参看<a href="10575.htm">10575</a>节）。这些就是此处所表示的事。</p>

And be propitious unto our iniquity and unto our sin. That this signifies that their interiors may be removed, which abound in falsities and evils, is evident from the signification of being "propitious 
unto iniquity and unto sin," when said of the external of worship, of the church, and of the Word in which was that people, as being that their interiors may be removed, because they abound in falsities 
and evils. That these things are signified by these words follows from the connection of the things in the internal sense, in which sense the subject treated of is the church to be instituted with 
that people. And the church cannot be instituted with any people unless their interiors have been opened, whereby there may be communication with heaven; and the interiors have not been opened except 
with those who are in the truths of faith from the good of life from the Lord. But with this people the interiors could not be opened, because they thought of nothing else than obtaining eminence 
and opulence above others by means of the worship of Jehovah; thus they had in mind nothing else than self and the world; and these are what close the interiors toward heaven, and open them toward hell. 
(That such were the interiors of that nation, which were closed when they were in worship, may be seen at n. 10575.) These therefore are the things which are signified. </p>

'And pardon our iniquity and our sin' means being so in order that things on an interior level in them, which teem with falsities and evils, may be shifted away. This is clear from the meaning of 'pardoning 
iniquity and sin', when this refers to the outward form that worship, the Church, and the Word took among the people, as being so in order that things on an interior level in them may be shifted 
away, because those things teem with falsities and evils. This meaning of these words follows from the train of thought in the internal sense, in which the Church to be established among those people 
is the subject. A Church cannot be established among any people unless their interiors are open, through which contact with heaven is effected; and those interiors are not open except in the case of 
those who are guided by truths of faith grounded in goodness of life, derived from the Lord. But the interiors of these people could not be opened up because they thought of the worship of Jehovah as 
nothing more than a means to obtain pre-eminence over others and to become richer than others, so that they had in mind nothing except themselves and the world. And these interests are what close the 
interiors in the direction of heaven and open them in the direction of hell. The fact that the interiors of that nation were like this, and that they were closed when they engaged in worship, see <a href="10575.htm">10575</a>. 
These then are the things that are meant here.  </p>

`Et propitius sis ad iniquitatem nostram, et ad peccatum nostrum':  quod significet ut removeantur interiora eorum quae scatent falsis et malis, constat ex significatione `propitius esse ad iniquitatem 
et ad peccatum' cum de externo cultus, Ecclesiae, et Verbi, in quo populus, quod sit ut interiora ejus removeantur, quia illa scatent falsis et malis; quod haec per illa verba significentur, sequitur 
ex serie rerum in sensu interno, in quo agitur de Ecclesia apud illum populum instituenda; et Ecclesia apud aliquem populum institui non potest nisi interiora ejus aperta sint, per quae communicatio 
{1}fit cum caelo; et interiora non aperta sunt nisi {2} apud illos qui in veris fidei {3}ex bono vitae sunt a Domino; at apud hunc populum interiora non aperiri potuerunt quia per cultum Jehovae nihil 
aliud cogitabant quam obtinere eminentiam et opulentiam super alios, ita non aliud in animo habuerunt quam se et mundum; et haec sunt quae claudunt interiora versus caelum, et aperiunt ea versus infernum; 
quod haec fuerint interiora illius gentis, {4}quae clausa cum in cultu erat, videatur n. 10575.  Haec itaque sunt quae significantur. @1 sit IT$ @2 i quam$ @3 sunt ex bono vitae$ @4 et quod ideo$ </p>
