<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3648节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3648.</strong>还有一种流注经由天堂从主进入植物界的物体，如各种树木及其果实，各种植被及其增多。除非来自主的属灵之物不断进入其种子里的原始形态产生作用，否则它们永远不会以如此神奇的方式和顺序发芽并生长。但那里的形态都是根本不接受任何生命的那种。它们正是通过这流注而拥有永恒和无限的形像在里面，这一点从以下事实明显看出来：它们处在繁殖自己的属和种的不断努力中，从而仿佛活到永远，还不断努力充满全世界。<br />这种努力是每一粒种子所固有的。然而，人却将所有这些奇事单单归于自然界，也不相信来自灵界的任何流注。因为他从内心否认灵界的存在，尽管他原本可以知道，若不通过那存在之物，任何事物都不可能持续存在；也就是说，持续存在就是永恒的存在；或也可说，繁殖就是不断的创造。所以，整个自然界就是代表主国度的一个舞台（<a href="3483.htm">3483</a>节）。蒙主的神圣怜悯，关于这个主题，以及植物界与大人的对应关系，我将在别处予以说明。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3648</b></p><p><b>3648.</b>
There is an influx from the Lord through heaven into the subjects also of the vegetable kingdom; as into trees of every kind, and into their fructifications; and into plants of various kinds, and their 
multiplications. Unless a spiritual principle from the Lord within continually acted into their primitive forms, which are in the seeds, they would never vegetate and grow in so wonderful a manner 
and succession; but the forms therein are such that they do not receive anything of life. It is from this influx that they have within them an image of the eternal and infinite, as is evident from the 
fact that they are in the continual endeavor to propagate their kind and their species, and thus to live as it were forever, and also to fill the universe; this endeavor being in every seed. But man 
attributes all these marvelous things to mere nature, nor believes in any influx from the spiritual world, because at heart he denies it; although he might know that nothing can subsist except through 
that from which it has come forth; that is, that subsistence is a perpetual coming forth; or what is the same, production is continual creation. That hence universal nature is a theater representative 
of the Lord's kingdom may be seen above (n. 3483). But on this subject also, and on the correspondence of the vegetable kingdom with the Grand Man, of the Lord's Divine mercy something shall be said 
elsewhere. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3648</b></p><p><b>3648.</b>
There is also an influx from the Lord by way of heaven into objects of the vegetable kingdom, such as every kind of tree and its fruitings, and every kind of young plant and its increases. But for the 
constant activity of that which is spiritual from the Lord into the primitive forms existing within their seeds they would never start to vegetate and grow in so amazing a manner and sequence. But the 
forms there are such that they do not receive any life at all. It is from this influx that they have an image of what is eternal and infinite within them, as is evident from the fact that they contain 
a constant endeavour to reproduce their own genus and their own species and in so doing to live so to speak for ever and also to fill the whole world. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This endeavour is inherent in every seed. 
Yet man attributes all those things that are so wondrous to natural forces themselves, not believing in any influx from the spiritual world since at heart he denies its existence. He does so even 
though he possibly knows that nothing can continue in existence apart from that which comes into existence, that is, he knows that a continuing in existence is a perpetual coming into existence, or what 
amounts to the same, reproduction is constant creation. Consequently the whole natural order is a theatre representative of the Lord's kingdom, see <a href="3483.htm">3483</a>. But these objects too, and their correspondence 
with the Grand Man, will in the Lord's Divine mercy be discussed elsewhere. </p>

</p><b>3648.</b>
Est influxus a Domino per caelum etiam in subjecta regni vegetabilis, ut in arbores omnis generis et in earum fructificationes, et in plantas varii generis et earum multiplicationes; nisi spirituale 
a Domino intus continue ageret in formas illarum primitivas quae sunt in seminibus, nusquam vegetarent et crescerent tam mirabili modo et successione; sed formae ibi tales sunt ut non recipiant aliquid 
vitae:  ex influxu illo est quod aeterni et infiniti imaginem in se habeant, {1}sicut patet ex eo quod in continuo conatu sint propagandi suum genus et suam speciem, ad sic vivendum quasi in aeternum, 
et quoque ad implendum universum; (m)hoc inest in quolibet semine; [2] sed homo omnia illa, quae tam mirifica, ipsi naturae tribuit, nec aliquem influxum e spirituali mundo credit, quia illum corde 
negat; tametsi sciret quod subsistere nihil possit, nisi per quod exstitit, hoc est, quod subsistentia sit perpetua existentia, seu quod idem, productio sit continua creatio(n):  quod inde universa natura 
sit theatrum repraesentativum regni Domini, videatur n. 3483; sed de his quoque, et de correspondentia eorum cum Maximo Homine, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, alibi dicendum. @1 in eo$ </p>
