<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4909节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4909.</strong>“说，这些东西是哪一个人的，我就是从哪一个人怀的孕”表这种特征就包含在他们的宗教表象中。这从“犹大”的代表和“怀孕”的含义清楚可知：“犹大”，就是此处的“人”，是指犹太民族的宗教表象（<a href="4864.htm">4864</a>，<a href="4905.htm">4905</a>节）；“怀孕”或怀孩子是指被生出来（<a href="4904.htm">4904</a>节），但此处是指包含在里面，也就是说，怀孕。这种产物是第一个结果；这个结果因反过来又产生了一个结果，所以被称为产生进一步结果的原因，如前所述（参看<a href="4904.htm">4904</a>节）。至于他们的宗教表象中究竟包含什么，可参看前面（<a href="4899.htm">4899</a>节），以及下文所述。</p>

Saying, By the man whose these are am I with child. That this signifies that such a quality was in their religiosity, is evident from the representation of Judah, who here is "the man," as being the 
religiosity of the Jewish nation (n. 4864, 4905); and from the signification of "carrying in the womb" or "being with child," as being to be produced (n. 4904); but here to be in, for that which has been 
produced (that is, that which is conceived) is in. This product is the first effect, which because efficient is called a cause, from which is further effect, of which above (see n. 4904). What was 
in their religiosity may be seen from what was said above (n. 4899), and also from what follows. </p>

'Saying, By the man to whom these belong I am pregnant' means that this characteristic was contained in their semblance of religion. This is clear from the representation of Judah, to whom 'the man' 
refers here, as the semblance of religion existing among the Jewish nation, dealt with in <a href="4864.htm">4864</a>, <a href="4905.htm">4905</a>, and from the meaning of 'carrying in the womb' or 'being pregnant' as being brought forth, dealt with 
in <a href="4904.htm">4904</a>, but here as being contained within; for what has been brought forth is that contained within, that is to say, that which has been conceived. That which has been brought forth is a first effect; 
and because this in turn produces an effect it is called the cause from which this further effect is produced, dealt with above in <a href="4904.htm">4904</a> What exactly was contained within their semblance of religion 
may be seen from what has been stated above in <a href="4899.htm">4899</a> and also from what follows below. </p>

`Dicendo, Viro, cui haec, ego gravida': quod significet quod religioso illorum tale inesset, constat a repraesentatione `Jehudae' qui hic `vir' quod sit religiosum gentis Judaicae, de qua n. 4864, 
4905; et ex significatione in utero gestare seu `gravida esse' quod sit produci, de qua n. 4904, hic autem inesse, nam quod productum est, id inest nempe id quod conceptum; productum hoc est primus 
effectus, qui quia est efficiens, vocantur causa, ex qua ulterior effectus, de quo supra n. 4904. Quid religioso illorum inesset, constare potest ab illis quae supra n. 4899 dicta sunt et quoque 
(c)ex illis quae sequuntur. </p>
