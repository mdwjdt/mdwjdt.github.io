<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1158节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1158.</strong>“那些分布于岛上的民族就出于这些人，有自己的陆地”表源于这些人的更多民族的敬拜；“岛”是指特定地区，因而是指距离内在敬拜更遥远的特定敬拜形式；“陆地”表这些敬拜形式的共同特征。这从圣言中“岛”的含义清楚可知。目前为止，所论述的主题一直是那些具有与内在相对应的外在敬拜之人。雅弗的七个儿子表那些更接近真正的内在敬拜之人，歌篾的儿子和雅完的儿子一起表那些距离真正的内在敬拜相对遥远之人。“岛上的民族”表那些更为遥远的人，严格来说，表那些彼此生活在仁爱中，但仍处于无知，对主、教会的信之教义和内在敬拜一无所知的人。然而，他们具有某种虔诚遵守的外在敬拜形式。在圣言中，这种人被称作“岛”，因此，“岛”的内义是指距离内在敬拜更为遥远的敬拜。象天使那样通晓内义的人不知道岛是什么，因为他们对这类事物不再有任何概念。他们感知到的不是岛，而是更遥远的敬拜，诸如教会外的外邦人所具有的敬拜。同样，他们将“岛”理解为距离仁爱有点远的教会自身里面的那些事物，如友谊和礼貌。友谊不是仁爱，礼貌更不是。它们是从仁爱那里延伸下来的；它们从仁爱汲取得越多，就越纯粹。<br />“岛”表这类事物，这可从以下圣言经文看出来。以赛亚书：<br />众海岛啊，当在我面前静默；众民当从新得力，都要近前来。海岛看见就都害怕；地极也都战兢，就近前来。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛41.1.htm">41:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛41.5.htm">5</a>）<br />此处，“岛”表教会之外正直的外邦人，他们虔诚遵守自己的外在敬拜。教会的最远界限被称为“地极”。同一先知书：<br />他不灰心，也不丧胆，直到祂在地上设立公理，海岛都等候祂的训诲。航海的和海中所有的，海岛和其上的居民，都当向耶和华唱新歌，从地极赞美祂！他们当将荣耀归给耶和华，在海岛中传扬他的颂赞。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.4.htm">42:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.10.htm">10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.12.htm">12</a>）<br />此处，“海岛”也表教会外的外邦人，他们过着无知、简单和正直的生活。<br />同一先知书：<br />众海岛啊，当听我言！远方的众民哪，留心而听！（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.1.htm">49:1</a>）<br />这同样表距离对主的敬拜和对信的认知更为遥远的外邦民族；因此，经上说“远方”。<br />海岛都要期待我，等候倚赖我的膀臂。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛51.5.htm">51:5</a>）<br />“海岛”所表相同。由于他们是过着正直生活的人，故经上说他们“都要期待我，等候倚赖我的膀臂”。耶利米书：<br />列国啊，要听耶和华的话，传扬在远处的海岛。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.10.htm">31:10</a>）<br />“海岛”同样有相同的意思。西番雅书：<br />耶和华必向他们显可畏之威；因祂必叫地上的诸神瘦弱，列国海岛的居民各在自己的地方敬拜祂。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番2.11.htm">2:11</a>）<br />“列国海岛”表距离对信的认知更为遥远的民族。<br />诗篇：<br />耶和华作王，愿地快乐，愿众海岛欢喜！密云和幽暗在祂的四围。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗97.1.htm">97:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗97.2.htm">2</a>）<br />“海岛”表相同的意思。在此，他们的无知通过“密云和幽暗”以代表性的方式来表述。但由于他们过着简单和正直的生活，故经上说“在祂的四围”。因“岛”表更远的事物，故“他施、普勒、路德、土巴和雅完”（他们也表外在敬拜形式），被称为“海岛”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛66.19.htm">66:19</a>）。基提也是（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.10.htm">2:10</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.6.htm">27:6</a>）。<br />与“陆地”或“高山”对比时，“海岛”也表信之真理，因为它们被种植在海里。因此，它们表教义，也就是仪式。</p>

Cooper(2008,2013)</b></p>
<p><strong>[NCE]1158.</strong> From these the islands of the nations dispersed in their lands means that the worship of many other nations sprang from them. The islands are particular regions — and so particular types of worship — that were even further removed; the lands are general ones. This can be seen from the symbolism of islands in the Word.<br />Up to this point, the discussion has centered on people who engaged in outer worship that corresponded to inner. Japheth's seven sons symbolized those who came closer to true inner worship. The seven sons that Gomer and Javan had between them symbolized those who stood further from true inner worship. The islands of the nations symbolize those still further off. Strictly speaking, they symbolize people who lived together in mutual kindness yet in ignorance, not knowing anything about the Lord, the church's religious precepts, or inner worship, although they did have a kind of outward worship that they performed with devotion. The Word calls people like this islands, so at a deeper level, islands symbolize worship that is more distant [from inner worship].<br />[2] People alive to the Word in its inner sense (angels, for instance) do not know what islands are because they no longer have a mental image of them. In place of islands they perceive worship that is further removed, like the worship that nations outside the church practice.<br />In a similar way, they also take islands to mean qualities in the genuine church that are somewhat more remote from charity — qualities like loyalty and politeness. Loyalty is not charity, politeness still less so; both are several steps below charity. The more they partake of charity, though, the more authentic they are.<br />[3] The following passages in the Word demonstrate that islands symbolize these things. In Isaiah:<br />Be silent for me, you islands, and let the peoples renew their strength; let them come near. The islands saw and were afraid; the ends of the earth shuddered; they approached and came. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1158/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_41_1" target=_top>Isaiah 41:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1158/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_41_5" target=_top>5</a>)<br />The islands stand for nations outside the church that were honest and that practiced the outward forms of their worship with devotion. The farthest boundaries of the church are called the ends of the earth. In the same author:<br />He will not go dark, and will not shatter anything, till he establishes judgment on the earth; and for his law the islands wait. Sing Jehovah a new song, his praise from the end of the earth, you that go down to the sea and you that fill it, you islands and you who inhabit them. They will give glory to Jehovah, and his praise they will tell in the islands. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1158/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_42_4" target=_top>Isaiah 42:4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1158/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_42_10" target=_top>10</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1158/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_42_12" target=_top>12</a>)<br />Here too islands stand for nations outside the church that have lived in ignorance, simple innocence, and honesty.<br />[4] In the same author:<br />Pay attention to me, you islands, and listen carefully, you people from far away. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1158/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_49_1" target=_top>Isaiah 49:1</a>)<br />Once again they stand for those nations that are further removed from worship of the Lord and from knowledge of the true faith and who are therefore described as being "from far away." In the same author:<br />In me the islands will put their hope, and for my arm they will wait. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1158/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_51_5" target=_top>Isaiah 51:5</a>)<br />The islands here stand for the same people. Because these are people who live uprightly, it says, "In me they will put their hope, and for my arm they will wait." In Jeremiah:<br />Listen to the Word of Jehovah, you nations, and tell it in the islands far away. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1158/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_31_10" target=_top>Jeremiah 31:10</a>)<br />They stand for the same people. In Zephaniah:<br />Jehovah is fearsome over them, since he will starve all the gods of the earth to death. And all the islands of the nations will bow down to him, each individual from her or his own place. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1158/bible_king-james-version_zephaniah_2_11" target=_top>Zephaniah 2:11</a>)<br />The islands of the nations stand for nations somewhat cut off from any knowledge of the true faith.<br />[5] In David:<br />Jehovah is reigning. Let the earth rejoice; let the many islands be glad! Cloud and darkness are all around him. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1158/bible_king-james-version_psalms_97_1-2" target=_top>Psalms 97:1-2</a>)<br />They stand for the same people. The ignorance of these people is expressed in a representative way by the cloud and darkness; but since they have a simple innocence and honesty, it says that the cloud and darkness are all around Jehovah.<br />Because islands symbolize what is relatively distant [from true worship], Tarshish, Pul,{*1} Lud, Tubal, and Javan — which symbolize outward forms of worship — are also called islands (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1158/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_66_19" target=_top>Isaiah 66:19</a>). So is Kittim (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1158/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_2_10" target=_top>Jeremiah 2:10</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1158/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_27_6" target=_top>Ezekiel 27:6</a>).<br />When islands are contrasted with the earth or with mountains, they also symbolize religious truth, and this is because they are set in the sea. In consequence, they mean doctrinal matters — that is, ritual.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Although Swedenborg elsewhere uses "Put" for the place-name mentioned in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1158/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_66_19" target=_top>Isaiah 66:19</a> (for example, at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1158/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1156" target=_top>1156:1</a> above), here he uses the alternate form "Pul." Both are associated with Libya. [Editors] </p>

From these were dispersed the isles* of the nations in their lands. That this signifies that the worships of many nations originated from these, that "isles" are particular regions and thus particular 
worships which were still more remote, and that "lands" are their generals, is evident from the signification of "isles" in the Word. Thus far they have been treated of who had external worship corresponding 
to internal. By the seven sons of Japheth were signified those who approached nearer to true internal worship; by the seven sons of Gomer and at the same time of Javan, those who were more remote 
from true internal worship. By "the isles of the nations" are signified those who are still more remote, and properly those who lived in mutual charity with one another, but yet in ignorance, knowing 
nothing about the Lord, about the doctrinals of faith of the church, and about internal worship; but who yet had a certain external worship which they religiously observed. Such are called "isles" 
in the Word, and therefore by "isles," in the internal sense, there is signified worship which is more remote from internal worship.  [2] They who are in the internal sense of the Word, as the angels 
are, have no knowledge of isles, for they no longer have any idea of such things;** but instead of them they perceive a remoter worship, such as is that of the nations out of the church. And in like 
manner by "isles" they perceive those things within the church itself which are somewhat remote from charity, as are friendships and civilities. Friendship is not charity, and still less is politeness 
charity-these are degrees below charity; and the more they derive from charity the more sincere they are.  [3] That such things are signified by "islands" may be seen from the following passages 
from the Word. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Keep silence before Me, O Islands; and let the peoples renew their strength, let them come near. The isles saw, and feared; the ends of the earth trembled; they drew near, 
and came (Isa. 41:1, 5). Here "islands" denote upright nations out of the church who have religiously observed their external worship. The furthest limits of the region where the church is are called 
"the ends of the earth." In the same: </p>
<p>     He shall not be dark, and shall not break in pieces till He has set judgment in the earth, and the isles shall wait for His law. Sing unto Jehovah a new 
song, His praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and the fullness thereof, the isles and the inhabitants thereof. Let them give glory to Jehovah, and declare His praise in the 
islands (Isa. 42:4, 10, 12). Here also "islands" denote nations out of the church, who have lived in ignorance, simplicity, and uprightness.  [4] In the same: </p>
<p>     Listen, O Isles, unto Me, and hearken, 
ye peoples from far (Isa. 49:1), likewise denoting those nations which are more remote from the worship of the Lord, and from the knowledges of faith; wherefore it is said "from far." Again: </p>
<p> 
    The Isles shall hope in Me, and on Mine arm shall they wait (Isa. 51:5), denoting the same. Because they are such as live in uprightness, it is said, "they shall hope in Me, and on Mine arm shall 
they wait." In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Hear the word of Jehovah, O ye nations, and declare it in the Isles afar off (Jer. 31:10),      Jehovah will be terrible unto them, for with leanness He will consume 
all the gods of the earth and they shall bow themselves down to Him, everyone from his place, even all the isles of the nations (Jer. 2:11). "The isles of the nations" denote nations more remote from 
the knowledges of faith.  [5] In David: </p>
<p>     Jehovah reigneth; let the earth rejoice let the multitude of isles be glad. Clouds and darkness are round about Him (Ps. 97:1, 2). denoting the same. Their 
ignorance is here representatively expressed by "clouds and darkness;" but because they are in simplicity and uprightness it is said "round about Him." Because by "islands" are signified those things 
which are more remote, Tarshish, Pul, Lud, Tubal, and Javan also-by whom were signified external worships-are called "islands" (Isa. 66:19). So also Kittim (Jer. 2:10; Ezek. 27:6). When contrasted 
with "lands," or with "mountains," "islands" signify also the truths of faith, from being in the sea; thus they signify doctrinals which are rituals. * In Scripture language every country is called 
an "isle," or "island," that is approached from canal by crossing the sea. [REVISER.] ** That is, of course, in this connection. [REVISER.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1158</b></p><p><b>1158.</b>
'From these the islands of the nations in their lands were spread abroad' means that the worship of even more nations emanated from these - 'islands' being individual pieces of land, and so individual 
forms of worship, which were more remote still, and 'lands' the general features of those forms of worship. This is clear from the meaning of 'islands' in the Word. Up to now the subject has been those 
who had external worship corresponding to internal. The seven sons of Japheth have meant those who came nearer to true internal worship, the seven sons of Gomer and of Javan together have meant those 
who were more remote from true internal worship. 'The islands of the nations' means those who are more remote still, strictly speaking those who lived in charity with one another but who were nevertheless 
uninformed people who knew nothing whatever about the Lord, about the Church's teachings concerning faith, or about internal worship. They did have some form of external worship however, which 
they kept up devoutly. Such people are called 'islands' in the Word, and therefore 'islands' means in the internal sense worship that is more remote. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Those who possess the internal sense of the 
Word, as angels do, are unaware of what islands are, for they no longer have any ideas of such things. Instead of islands they perceive a more remote kind of worship like that found among gentile nations 
outside the Church. In a similar way they also perceive by islands things inside the Church itself which are somewhat more remote from charity, as forms of friendship and civility are. Friendship 
is not the same as charity, civility even less so. They are steps down from charity, though the more they draw from charity the more genuine they are. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The fact that 'islands' has this meaning 
becomes clear from the following places in the Word: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Keep silent before Me, O islands, and let the peoples renew their strength, let them approach. The islands saw and were afraid, the 
ends of the earth trembled; they drew near and came. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2041:1,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 41:1, 5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'islands' stands for upright gentiles outside the Church who have devoutly kept up their own type of external worship. The furthest 
limits of the Church are called 'the ends of the earth'. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
He will not be in darkness, and He will not break up until He has set judgement on the earth; and the islands wait 
for His law. Sing to Jehovah a new song, His praise from the end of the earth, you that go down to the sea, and all that is in it, the islands and their inhabitants. They will give glory to Jehovah, 
and declare His praise in the islands <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2042:4,%2010,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 42:4, 10, 12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here again 'islands' stands for gentiles outside the Church who have lived without knowledge, in simplicity and uprightness. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the 
same prophet,	 </p>
<blockquote>
Listen to Me, O islands, and hearken, O peoples from afar. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2049:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 49:1</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This similarly stands for gentile nations who are more remote from worship of the Lord and from the cognitions 
of faith; hence the expression 'from afar' is used. In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
In Me the islands will hope and await My arm. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2051:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 51:5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here too 'islands' has the same meaning. The phrase 'in Me they 
will hope and await My arm' is used because they are people who are living uprightly. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Hear the Word of Jehovah, O nations, and declare it in the islands afar off. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2031:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 31:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Once 
again 'islands' has the same meaning. In Zephaniah, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah will be terrible against them, for He will destroy with leanness all the gods of the earth, and to Him will bow down, each in its place, 
all the islands of the nations. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zeph%202:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zeph 2:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The islands of the nations' stands for gentile nations more remote from cognitions of faith. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah reigns, let the earth rejoice, 
let the many islands be glad! Cloud and thick darkness are round about Him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2097:&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 97:</a>
</blockquote>
l, <a href="2.htm">2</a>. </p>
<p>Again 'islands' has the same meaning. Here their lack of knowledge is expressed in representative fashion 
by means of 'cloud and thick darkness'. But because they are living in simplicity and uprightness the phrase 'round about Him' is used. Because 'islands' means things that are more remote, 'Tarshish, 
Pul, Lud, Tubal, and Javan' also, who meant forms of external worship, were called 'islands', in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2066:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 66:19</a>, as also is Kittim in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%202:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 2:10</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2027:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 27:6</a>. Furthermore when islands are mentioned as distinct 
from land or mountains they mean truths of faith because they are planted in the sea. Thus they mean doctrinal teachings which exist as forms of ritual. </p>

Quod 'ex his dispersae sunt insulae gentium in terris suis' significent quod plurium gentium cultus ex illis exstiterint, et quod 'insulae' sint particulares tractus, ita particulares cultus, qui adhuc

infra charitatem, at quo plus trahunt a charitate, eo plus sunt sincerae.  [3] Quod per 'insulas' talia significentur, constare potest ab his in Verbo locis; apud Esaiam, 	Obmutescite Mihi, insulae,

gentium' pro gentibus remotioribus a cognitionibus fidei:  [5] apud Davidem,@Jehovah regnat, exsultet terra, laetentur insulae multae; nubes et caligo circum circa Ipsum, Ps. xcvii 1, [2];@pro iisdem; 
ignorantia eorum hic repraesentative exprimitur per 'nubem et caliginem,' sed quia in simplicitate et probitate, dicitur 'circum circa Ipsum.'  Quia per 'insulas' significantur illa quae remotiora sunt, 
etiam Tarshish, Pul, Lud, Tubal et Javan per quos significati sunt externi cultus, appellati sunt 'insulae,' Esai. lxvi 19, tum quoque Kittim Jer. ii 10; Ezech. xxvii 6.  Insulae quoque cum opponuntur 
terrae aut montibus, significant vera fidei, ex eo quod in mari sint; ita doctrinalia, quae sunt ritualia.@$ </p>
