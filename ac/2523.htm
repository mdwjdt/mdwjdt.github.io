<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2523节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2523.</strong>“她是我妹子”表当请教的是理性，也就是说，祂认为应当这样请教。这从本章“妹子”的含义清楚可知，“妹子”是指理性真理（参看<a href="1495.htm">1495</a>，<a href="2508.htm">2508</a>节）。主的整个生命，就是诸如在世时它要成为的样子，在圣言的内义中被描述出来，甚至包括祂的直觉和思维。这些事因来自神性，故早已预见并规定了。就内义而言，对它们作出这种规定的另外一个原因是，主在世时的生命事件可以被展示出来，如同将真实情况呈现给根据内义领悟圣言的天使。主以这种方式置于他们面前，同时祂逐渐脱去人性，披上神性的方式也置于他们面前。若非这些事通过圣言，以及通过犹太教会的一切宗教仪式如同呈现真实情况那样显现给天使，那么被称为“人”或亚当的上古教会一没落，主就必须降世。因为上古教会一没落，经上（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创3.15.htm">3:15</a>）就预言了主的降临。而且，若非如此，那时的人类无法得救。<br />至于主的生命本身，它是人性朝着神性不断发展，直到完全合一（如前面频繁所述）的过程。因为若要与地狱争战并战胜它们，主必须通过这人身，与地狱争战不会通过神性进行。既然如此，祂乐意象其他人那样披上人身，乐意象其他人那样成为一个小孩子，乐意在亚伯拉罕寄居埃及（12章），以及现在寄居基拉耳所代表和表示的知识和认知方面成长。因此，祂乐意象其他人那样发展理性，驱散包裹它的幽暗，将其带入光中，并且凭祂自己的力量成就这一切。仅仅考虑到以下事实，也没人会质疑主以这样的方式从人性发展到神性：即祂是一个小孩子，和其他小孩子一样学习说话，等等。不过，也有不同：即神性本身在祂里面，因为祂从耶和华成孕。</p>

She is my sister. That this signifies that it was the rational which should be consulted (that is, that he so thought), is evident from the signification of "sister" in this chapter as being rational 
truth (see n. 1495, 2508). In the internal sense of the Word the Lord's whole life is described, such as it was to be in the world, even as to the perceptions and thoughts, for these were foreseen and 
provided because from the Divine; this being done for the additional reason that all these things might be set forth at that time as present to the angels, who perceive the Word according to the internal 
sense; and that so the Lord might be before them, and at the same time how by successive steps He put off the human, and put on the Divine. Unless these things had been as if present to the angels, 
through the Word, and also through all the rites in the Jewish Church, the Lord would have been obliged to come into the world immediately after the fall of the Most Ancient Church, which is called 
Man or Adam; for there was an immediate prophecy of the Lord's advent (Gen. 3:15); and what is more, the human race of that time could not otherwise have been saved. [2] As regards the Lord's life 
itself, it was a continual progression of the Human to the Divine, even to absolute union (as already frequently stated), for in order that He might combat with the hells and overcome them, He must needs 
do it from the Human; for there is no combat with the hells from the Divine. It therefore pleased Him to put on the human like another man, to be an infant like another, to grow up into knowledges 
[in scientias et in cognitiones], which things are represented by Abraham's sojourning in Egypt (chapter 12), and now in Gerar; thus it pleased Him to cultivate the rational as another man, and in this 
way to disperse its shade, and bring it into light, and this from His own power. That the Lord's progression from the Human to the Divine was of this nature, can be denied by no one if he only considers 
that He was a little child, and learned to talk like one; and so on. But there was this difference: that the Divine Itself was in Him, seeing that He was conceived of Jehovah. </p>

'She is my sister' means that it was the rational which ought to be consulted, that is to say, He thought that such a consultation should take place. This is clear from the meaning of 'a sister' in this 
chapter as rational truth, dealt with in <a href="1495.htm">1495</a>, <a href="2508.htm">2508</a>. In the internal sense of the Word the Lord's entire life is described, as it was going to be when He was in the world, even as to His perceptions 
and thoughts. For these things had been foreseen and provided, since they were from the Divine. A further reason for this provision of them in the internal sense was so that the things of the Lord's 
life in the world might be manifested as present realities to the angels, who perceive the Word according to its internal sense. In this way the Lord was placed before them, and at the same time the 
manner in which He gradually cast off the human and put on the Divine. Unless these things had been manifested to the angels as present realities by means of the Word, and also by means of all the religious 
observances of the Jewish Church, it would have been necessary for the Lord to come into the world immediately after the fall of the Most Ancient Church, which is called 'Man' or Adam; for the 
Lord's Advent was foretold immediately the Fall took place, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%203:%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 3: 15</a>. And what is more, the human race existing at that time could not otherwise have been saved. </p>

 As regards the Lord's life itself, 
it was a life in which the Human was constantly advancing towards the Divine, even to complete union, as stated many times already. For to fight the hells and overcome them He had to do so from 
the Human, since no conflict with the hells takes place from the Divine. That being so, He was pleased to put on the human as any other person; to be a small child as any other; to grow in knowledge 
and cognitions which were represented and meant by Abraham's sojourning in Egypt, Chapter <a href="12.htm">12</a>, and now in Gerar. Thus He was pleased to develop the rational like any other person and to dispel the shadow 
enveloping it and to bring it into light, and to do so from His own power. That the Lord advanced in this manner from the Human to the Divine, no one can be in any doubt if he merely considers the 
fact that He was a small child, and learned to talk as any small child does, and so on. But there was this difference, that the Divine itself dwelt within Him because He had been conceived from Jehovah. </p>

Quod `soror mea haec' significet quod rationale esset quod consuleretur, nempe quod ita cogitaverit, constat ex significatione `sororis' in hoc capite quod sit verum rationale, de qua n. 1495, 2508. 
In sensu interno Verbi tota vita Domini, qualis futura in mundo, describitur, etiam quoad perceptiones et cogitationes, praevisa enim haec fuerunt et provisa, quia a Divino; ob causam etiam ut illa praesenti' 
sisterentur angelis tunc, qui Verbum secundum sensum internum percipiunt, et sic coram illis Dominus, et simul quomodo exuit successive humanum et induit Divinum; nisi haec per Verbum, (m)tum 
quoque per omnes ritus in Ecclesia Judaica,(n) sicut praesentia fuissent angelis, debuisset Dominus in mundum venire statim post lapsum Antiquissimae Ecclesiae, quae `homo' seu Adam vocatur, propheticum 
enim tunc statim fuit de Adventu Domini, Gen. iii 15; et quod magis non salvari potuisset genus humanum quod tunc.  [2] Quod ipsam vitam Domini spectat, illa fuit continua progressio Humani ad Divinum 
usque ad absolutam unionem, ut pluries prius dictam; ut enim pugnare cum infernis, et vinceret illa, (m)debuit ex Humano, nam nulla pugnaret cum infernis est ex Divino, idcirco(n) placuit Ipsi induere 
humanum sicut alius homo, infans esse sicut alius, adolescere in scientias et in cognitiones quae repraesentata et significata sunt per peregrinationem Abrahami in Aegypto, cap. xii, et nunc in 
Gerare, ita sicut alius homo excolere rationale, (c)et sic umbram ejus discutere, et illud in lucem mittere, et hoc ex propria potentia: quod talis fuerit progressio Domini ab Humano ad Divinum, nulli 
dubium potest esse, si modo {1} expendat, quod infans fuerit, et didicerit loqui sicut infans, ac sic porro; sed illa erat differentia, quod Ipsum Divinum in Ipso fuit, quia {2} a Jehovah conceptus. 	@1
