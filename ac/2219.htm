<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2219节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2219.</strong>“面向所多玛观看”表人类的状态。这从“面向观看”的含义清楚可知，此处是“面向所多玛”。在圣言中，“面（或脸）”表所有人的内心，无论是恶是善。因为它们从脸上闪耀出来，如第一卷所示（<a href="358.htm">358</a>节）。因此，这里的“面”因论及所多玛，故表示内心的邪恶，也就是自我之爱的邪恶。因为内心的邪恶一般由“所多玛”来表示，这从下文明显可知。最坏的邪恶源于自我之爱，这是因为自我之爱对人类社会具有毁灭性，如前所示（<a href="2045.htm">2045</a>节），并且对天堂社群也具有毁灭性（<a href="2057.htm">2057</a>节）。由于人类的堕落通过那爱欲可以辨识，故“面向所多玛”表示人类的状态。<br />此外，第一卷各处已说明自我之爱的性质是什么，也就是说，它与人受造时被导入的秩序完全相反。与动物不同，人被赋予理性，好叫每个人都能意愿善事，并向他人，无论具体的每个人还是总体的所有人行善。这就是人受造时被导入的秩序，所以这秩序就是旨在构成人生命的对神之爱和对邻之爱，人凭这生命而有别于禽兽。这也是天堂的秩序，目的是这秩序在人活在世上时就存在于他里面；他因此在主的国度中，当脱去在世时服侍他的肉身后，他便进入这个国度，并在那里上升，进入在天堂的完美中不断增长的状态。<br />但自我之爱是首要的、事实上是独一无二的能摧毁这些爱的东西。对这个世界的爱则没有如此的毁灭性，事实上，对这个世界的爱与信的属天事物对立，而自我之爱则与爱的属天事物直接对立。因为凡爱自己的，都不爱其他人，而是试图毁灭凡不尊敬他的所有人。他也不意愿善事，不向任何人行善，除非这人是他自己的一部分，或能被迷住，以至于成为他自己的一部分，就像是被注入其恶欲和谬念的某种东西。由此明显可知，自我之爱就是源头，一切仇恨、报复、残忍，以及一切可耻的伪装和欺骗，因而一切违背人类社会秩序和天堂社群秩序的可憎之事皆从自我之爱涌出。<br />自我之爱极其恶毒，以至于对它的约束一放松，也就是说，自我之爱，即便是那些处于最底层的人所具有的那种，一旦有机会为所欲为，它就会迫不及待地向前冲，不但渴望统治邻人和附近的人，还渴望统治整个宇宙，甚至统治至高无上的神性存在本身。事实上，人并未意识到这一点，因为他被保守在不甚了解的约束中。不过，如前所述，这些约束越松懈，他就越往前冲，我通过来世的大量经历已得知这一点。由于这些事就隐藏在自我之爱中，故被自我之爱所主导、不受良知约束的人比所有其他人更憎恨主，因而憎恨一切信之真理，因为这些正是主国度的秩序法则。这种人非常排斥这些法则，以至于憎恶它们，这一点在来世也会公开显明。这爱欲就是“女人的种”（即主）要“踹”的“蛇的头”（对此，参看第一卷，<a href="257.htm">257</a>节）。<br />但自我之爱表面上并不总是表现为骄傲自大，有时这些人也能以仁爱对待邻人。有些人生来就具有这种表面的仁爱性情，而有些人小时候获得它，但后来它屈服了，然而表面的性情仍存留。不过，那些被自我之爱所主导的人都鄙视他人，与自己相比，视他们如无物。他们毫不关心公众利益，除非它对自己有利，并且他们自己可以说就是公众利益。那些仇恨并迫害凡不支持、服侍他们的所有人之人尤其如此，他们会极尽所能地掠夺这些人的财产、荣誉、名声，甚至生命。要让那些故意做出这种事的人认识到，他们尤其具有自我之爱。</p>

They looked toward the faces of Sodom. That this signifies the state of the human race, is evident from the signification of "looking to the faces," here, to the faces of Sodom. By "faces" are signified 
all man's interiors, both good and evil, for the reason that they shine forth from the face (as shown in volume 1, n. 358). Here therefore "faces," because predicated of Sodom, signify interior evils, 
which are those of the love of self, and which evils in general are meant by "Sodom," as will be evident from what now follows. That the worst evils of all originate from the love of self, is because 
the love of self is destructive of human society (as shown above, n. 2045), and of heavenly society (n. 2057); and since the perversity of the human race is thence known, by the "faces of Sodom" 
is here signified the state of the human race. [2] Moreover it has been shown in volume 1, in various places, what the nature of the love of self is, namely, that it is diametrically contrary to the 
order into which man was created. Man is distinguished above beasts by having a rational given him, to the end that everyone may will well and do well to others, as in general so in particular. This is 
the order into which man has been created; consequently it is love to God and love toward the neighbor that should be man's life, and by which he should be distinguished from brute animals. This is 
also the order of heaven, in which it was intended man should be while he lives in the world; thus in the Lord's kingdom; and into this kingdom he would pass when he had put off the body that had been 
of service to him upon the earth, and there he would rise into a state continually advancing in heavenly perfection. [3] But the love of self is the primary and indeed the only thing that destroys all 
this; and not so much so the love of the world, for this is indeed opposite to the spiritual things of faith, but the love of self is diametrically opposite to the celestial things of love; for he 
who loves himself loves no others, but endeavors to destroy all persons whatever that do not pay reverence to him; nor does he will well and do well to anyone, except to him who is a part of himself, 
or can be captivated so as to be a part of himself, like something inoculated as it were with his cupidities and phantasies. Hence it is evident that from the love of self there gush forth all hatreds, 
all revenges and cruelties, as also all infamous simulations and deceits, and thus all heinous things against the order of human society and against the order of heavenly society. [4] Nay, so heinous 
is the love of self, that when its bonds are relaxed, that is, when opportunity of free range is given it, even with those who are in the lowest condition, it so rushes on, that it not only wills to 
exercise dominion over neighbors and those near at hand, but also over the universe, and even over the Supreme Divine Itself. Of this the man is indeed ignorant, because he is kept in bonds not well 
known to him, but insofar as these bonds are slackened (as before said), so far he rushes on; and this it has been given me to know from much experience in the other life. As these things lie hidden 
in the love of self, they who are in the love of self, and are not endowed with the bonds of conscience, above all others hold the Lord in hatred, consequently all the truths of faith, for these are the 
very laws of order in the Lord's kingdom, and these they reject so as to abominate them, which also shows itself openly in the other life. This love is also the "serpent's head," which the "Seed of 
the woman" (that is, the Lord) "treads down" (concerning which see volume 1, n. 257). [5] But the love of self is not always that which appears in the outward form as pride and haughtiness, for sometimes 
such persons are able to hold the neighbor in charity, for with some such an external is born, and with some it is contracted in early life, but is afterwards subjugated, the external still remaining. 
But those are in the love of self who despise others and make them of no account in comparison with themselves, and who care nothing for the common good, unless it is for them, and they themselves, 
as it were, are it, especially those who hate all by whom they are not favored and served, persecuting them, and so far as they are able depriving them of their possessions, honor, reputation, and 
even life. Let those who breathe such things in intention know that they are preeminently in the love of self. </p>

'They looked towards the face of Sodom' means the state of the human race. This is clear from the meaning of 'looking towards the face', here 'towards the face of Sodom'. In the Word 'the face' means 
all man's interiors - evil as well as good - for the reason that these shine out of the face, as shown in Volume One, in <a href="358.htm">358</a>. Here therefore, because 'the face' is used in reference to Sodom, it is interior 
evils, which are those of self-love, that are meant; for interior evils in general are meant by 'Sodom', as will be evident from what follows in the next paragraph. The reason the worst evils 
of all originate in self-love is that self-love is destructive of human society, as shown above in <a href="2045.htm">2045</a>, and destructive of heavenly society, <a href="2057.htm">2057</a>. And since the perversity of the human race is recognized 
from that love, here 'the face of Sodom' means the state of the human race. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In addition to this, it has been shown in various places in Volume One what the nature of self-love is, namely a 
love completely contrary to the order into which man was created. Unlike beasts man was endowed with rationality, to the end that every individual person may will what is good and do what is good to 
any other, thus to everyone in particular as to all in general. Such is the order into which man was created, and therefore it is love to God and love towards the neighbour which were intended to constitute 
man's life, which life was to mark him off from animals. Such also is the order of heaven which, it was intended, would exist in man while he was living in the world. He would thus be in the Lord's 
kingdom, into which he would also pass when he had cast off the body that had served him on earth, and in that kingdom would rise up into a state constantly increasing in heavenly perfection. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
But self-love is the chief, indeed the one and only, thing that destroys these loves. Love of the world is not so destructive; for although this is indeed contrary to the spiritual things of faith, 
self-love is diametrically opposed to the celestial things of love. For someone who loves himself does not love any others but tries to destroy everyone who fails to pay respect to him. Nor does he 
will what is good and do what is good to anybody except to one who is an extension of himself or can be made to become such, like something into which his evil desires and false notions have been so to 
speak engrafted. From this it is evident that self-love is the source from which all forms of hatred, all forms of revenge and cruelty well up, and also all forms of disgraceful presence and of deceit 
- thus every abominable thing that is contrary to the order that belongs to human society and contrary to the order of heavenly society. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Indeed self-love is so abominable that when the restraints 
placed upon it are lifted, that is, when it is given the opportunity to do whatever it pleases, then even with those who belong to the lowest sort, it rushes with such urgency that it desires not 
only to exercise dominion over those nearest to it and over those close by, but also over the universe and even over the Supreme Divine Being Himself. Man is not indeed aware of this because he is held 
back by restraints he knows little about. But to the extent these restraints, as has been stated, are removed he very rapidly does the same. This I have been given to know from much experience in 
the next life. Because these things lie concealed within self-love, people governed by self-love and not endowed with the restraints of conscience, more than all others hate the Lord, and thus hate all 
the truths of faith, since these are the very laws of order in the Lord's kingdom. Such people dislike these laws so much as to loathe them, and this also shows itself openly in the next life. This 
love is also the head of the serpent which the seed of the woman, that is, the Lord, treads down, regarding which see Volume One, in <a href="257.htm">257</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 But self-love does not always present itself outwardly 
in arrogance and pride, for sometimes such people are able to regard the neighbour with charity. Some people are born with this outwardly charitable disposition, while others acquire it during childhood 
years, but after this it is subdued, though the outward disposition does still remain. But those governed by self-love are such as despise others and regard them as nothing in comparison with themselves. 
Nor do they have any concern whatever for the common good unless this exists for their benefit, they themselves being so to speak the common good. This applies especially to those who hate and 
persecute everyone who does not show them favour or serve them, and as far as possible they rob such persons of possessions, honour, reputation, and even life. Let those who behave intentionally in these 
ways realize that with them pre-eminently self-love is present. </p>

`Prospexerunt ad facies Sodomae': quod significet statum humani generis, constat a significatione `prospicere ad facies,' et hic `ad facies Sodomae'; per `facies' significantur {1} `omnia interiora 
hominis, tam mala quam bona, ex causa quia illa elucent ex facie, ut in Parte Prima n. 358 ostensum, hic itaque `facies' quia praedicantur de Sodoma, significant interiora mala quae sunt amoris sui, quae 
mala in genere per `Sodomam' intelliguntur, ut a mox sequentibus patebit.  Quod omnium {2} pessima mala ex amore sui originem trahant, est quia amor sui est destructivus societatis humanae, ut ostensum 
supra n. 2045, et {3} destructivus societatis caelestis, n. 2057; et quia perversitas generis humani inde cognoscitur, hic per `facies Sodomae' significatur status generis humani.  [2] Ostensum 
praeterea est in Parte Prima variis in locis qualis amor sui est {4}, quod nempe prorsus contrarius sit ordini in quem creatus est homo; homini prae {5} bestiis rationale datum est, ob finem ut quisque 
alteri bene velit et bene faciat, sic in particulari ut in communi, hic est ordo in quem creatus est homo; proinde est amor in Deum et amor erga proximum, quae vita foret hominis, per quam distingueretur 
a brutis animalibus; hic etiam est ordo caeli, in quo foret cum {6} vivit in mundo {7}, et sic in regno Domini; ac in idem transiret, cum exuit corpus quod ei inserviit super terra, (c)et ibi in 
statum continue perfectiorem caelestem assurgeret: [3] sed amor sui est primarium, immo unicum quod destruit haec, non ita amor mundi, nam hic quidem spiritualibus fidei, sed amor sui caelestibus amoris 
e diametro oppositus est; (t)qui enim se amat, omnes alios non amat, sed quoscumque qui illum non colunt, destruere conatur, nec alicui bene vult et bene facit, nisi qui in illo est, aut {8} (x)captari 
potest, ut in illo sit, sicut quoddam ejus cupiditatibus et phantasiis quasi inoculatum'; inde patet quod ex amore sui (o)scaturiant omnia odia, (o)omnes vindictae (o)et crudelitates, tum {9} omnes 
infames simulationes et doli, ita omnia nefanda contra ordinem societatis humanae, et contra ordinem societatis caelestis: [4] (o)quin immo tam nefandus est amor sui ut cum vincula ei relaxantur, 
hoc est, cum `ei datur' copia exspatiandi, etiam apud eos qui infimae sortis sunt, ruat ita ut non solum dominari velit super proximos et vicinos, sed etiam super universum, immo super ipsum Supremum 
Divinum, quod quidem ignorat homo quia in vinculis non ita sibi notis tenetur, sed quantum haec vincula, ut dictum, {10} remittuntur, tantum ruit; quod a multa experientia in altera vita mihi scire datum 
est: {11}quia in amore sui illa latent, etiam illi qui in amore sui sunt et non donati vinculis conscientiae, prae omnibus aliis odio habent Dominum,(m) {12} ita omnia vera fidei, nam haec sunt ipsae 
leges ordinis in regno Domini; haec tales respuunt ita ut abominentur, quod etiam se manifestat coram in altera vita(n); hic amor etiam est caput serpentis, quod semen mulieris, hoc est, Dominus proculcat 
{13}, de quo videatur in Parte Prima, n. 257.  [5] Sed amor sui non est semper ille qui in externa forma apparet sicut fastus et superbia, quandoque enim ii {14} possunt charitate habere proximum; 
`quibusdam enim tale externum connascitur, et a quibusdam in aetate puerili adsciscitur, sed postea subjugatur {15}, remanente usque externo; sed sunt illi qui alios prae se contemnunt ac prae se 
nihili faciunt, nec commune bonum quicquam curant nisi sit pro illis et ii quasi sint illud; imprimis qui omnes illos qui sibi non favent et serviunt, odio habent, illos persequuntur, et quantum possunt, 
deprivant possessionibus, honore, fama, immo vita; qui talia spirant animo, illi sciant quod in amore sui sint prae aliis. 	@1 i in Verbo.$ 	@2 omnia.$ 	@3 i quia.$ 	@4 sit.$ 	@5 i enim.$ 	@6
