<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8382.</strong>木星有时会派使者或使臣与我同在，以便与我交流，并把他们长时间地留在我身边。我由此得以知道他们的秉性；他们完全不同于我们地球灵。当与我同在时，他们经常被我们地球灵骚扰，但他们不为之所扰。他们只是把这事报告给派遣他们的灵人社群；他们在报告这事时，从我身边退离了一点。</p>

The spirits of Jupiter sometimes had emissaries or subjects with me, for the sake of communication, and this for a rather long time. From this it was given me to know their native quality, and that they 
are wholly different from the spirits of our earth. When they were with me, they were often infested by the spirits of our earth, but they did not care about it. They merely told it to the society 
of their spirits by whom they had been sent out; and while they were telling it, they withdrew a little from me. </p>

The spirits from Jupiter have on several occasions had emissaries or subordinates present with me in order to communicate with me, leaving them with me for quite lengthy periods. This enabled me to know 
the character of them and that they were entirely different from spirits belonging to our planet. While they were with me they were often molested by spirits belonging to our planet, but they were 
not bothered by this. They merely reported it to the community of spirits who had sent them; and when they reported it they departed a little from me. </p>

Spiritus Joviales aliquoties habebant {1}emissarios seu subjecta apud me communicationis causa, et hoc satis diu; inde dabatur scire qua indole essent, et quod prorsus (x)differrent a spiritibus nostrae 
telluris; cum apud me erant, saepe infestabantur a spiritibus nostrae telluris, sed non id curabant, modo hoc narrabant societati spirituum suorum a quibus emissi sunt; et cum narrabant, paulum a 
me recedebant. 	@1 subjecta seu emissarios$ </p>
