<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1471节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1471.</strong>创世记12:12. 埃及人看见你必说，这是他的妻子，他们就要杀我，却叫你存活。<br />“埃及人看见你”表由认知构成的知识，当属天的认知被看到时，其性质被如此描述。“必说，这是他的妻子”表他们必视这些认知为属天的。“他们就要杀我，却叫你存活”表他们对属天之物不感兴趣，只关心纯粹的认知，他们要带走这些认知。</p><br />

"And it will happen when the Egyptians see you that they will say, 钬楾his is his wife,' and kill me and keep you alive."<br />And it will happen when the Egyptians see you symbolizes the study of religious concepts; what is being depicted is the turn that study takes when the people who engage in it see heavenly concepts. That they will say, 钬楾his is his wife,' means that they will call such concepts heavenly. And kill me and keep you alive means that they would not care about heavenly things but only about the knowledge itself, which they would steal. </p>

Verse 12. And it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will say, This is his wife, and they will kill me, and will make thee to live. "And it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians 
shall see thee," signifies the memory-knowledge of knowledges [scientia cognitionum], which is described as to what it is when they see celestial knowledges; "that they will say, This is his 
wife," signifies that they will call the knowledges celestial; "and they will kill me, and will make thee to live," signifies that they would not care for the celestial things, but only for the mere knowledges, 
which they would carry off. </p>

Verse 12 And it will be, when the Egyptians see you they will say, This is his wife, and they will slay me and let you live. </p>
<p>'And it will be, when the Egyptians see you' means knowledge comprised 
of cognitions, it being the nature of that knowledge when celestial cognitions are seen that is described 'And they will say, This is his wife' means that they will call those cognitions celestial 'And 
they will slay me and let you live' means that they would have no interest in the celestial things, only in the mere cognitions, which they would carry away </p>

Vers. 12.  Et erit, cum viderint te Aegyptii, et dicent, Uxor illius haec, et occident me, et te vivificabunt. 'Et erit, cum viderint re Aegyptii' significat scientiam cognitionum, quae describitur 
qualis est cum cognitiones caelestes vident: 'et dicent, Uxor illius haec' significat quod vocabunt illas caelestes: 'et occident me, et te vivificabunt' significat quod caelestia non curarent sed modo 
meras cognitiones quas auferrent. </p>
