Verses 42, 43. And thou shalt make for them breeches of linen to cover the flesh of their nakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall be. And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, 
when they go in unto the Tent of meeting, or when they come near unto the altar to minister in what is holy; lest they bear iniquity, and die; it is a statute of an age to him and to his seed after 
him. "And thou shalt make for them breeches of linen," signifies what is external of conjugial love; "to cover the flesh of their nakedness," signifies lest the interior things of the love, which are 
filthy and infernal, should appear; "from the loins even unto the thighs they shall be," signifies their extension, that is, of the exteriors of conjugial love; "and they shall be upon Aaron, and upon 
his sons," signifies protection from the hells; "when they go in unto the Tent of meeting," signifies in the representative worship of all things of heaven and of the church; "or when they come near 
unto the altar to minister in what is holy," signifies in the representative worship of the Lord Himself; "lest they bear iniquity, and die," signifies the annihilation of the whole of worship; "it is 
a statute of an age to him and to his seed after him," signifies the laws of order in the representative church. </p>

Verses 42, 43 And make for them linen undergarments to cover their naked flesh; from the loins even to the thighs they shall be. And they shall be on Aaron and on his sons when they go into the tent

<p>'And make for 
them linen undergarments' means an external level of conjugial love. 'To cover their naked flesh' means to prevent inner desires of that love from appearing when they are foul and hellish. 'From the loins 
even to the thighs they shall be' means the range of those things [composing that external level]. 'And they shall be on Aaron and on his sons' means safety from the hells. 'When they go into the 
tent of meeting' means in worship representative of all things of heaven and the Church. 'Or when they approach the altar to minister in the holy place' means in worship representative of the Lord Himself. 
'That they may not bear iniquity and die' means the elimination of the whole of worship. 'It shall be the statute of an age for him and his seed after him' means laws of order in the representative 
Church.

Vers. 42, 43. Et fac eis femoralia lini ad tegendum carnem nuditatis, a lumbis [et] usque ad femora erunt. Et erunt super Aharone, et super filiis ejus in intrandis illis ad tentorium conventus, aut 
accedendis illis ad altare ad ministrandum in sancto, ne portent iniquitatem et moriantur; statutum saeculi ei et semini ejus post illum. `Et fac eis femoralia lini' significat externum amoris conjugialis: 
`ad tegendum carnem nuditatis' significat ne interiora amoris, quae (x)spurca et infernalia, appareant: `a lumbis usque ad femora erunt' significat extensionem illorum {1}: `et erunt super Aharone 
et super filiis ejus' significat tutelam ab infernis: `in intrandis illis in tentorium conventus' significat in cultu repraesentativo omnium caeli et Ecclesiae: `aut accedendis illis ad altare ad 
ministrandum in sancto' significat in cultu repraesentativo Ipsius Domini: `ne portent iniquitatem et moriantur' significat annihilationem totius cultus: `statutum saeculi ei et semini ejus post illum'
