<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6381节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6381.</strong>从目前关于犹大的论述很清楚地看出，圣言含有一个内义，并且人若不知道这层意义所包含的东西，绝无可能知道此处关于犹大所说的这些话是什么意思。如他不可能知道“他是个狮子的幼崽”、“捕获了猎物便上去”、“他蹲伏，卧如狮子，又如老狮”是什么意思。他也不可能知道“他两脚之间的立法者”、“细罗”、“把小驴拴在葡萄树上，把母驴的崽子拴在上好的葡萄树上”、“在葡萄酒中洗了衣服，在血红葡萄汁中洗了袍褂”、“他的眼睛必因酒红润；他的牙齿必因奶白亮”是什么意思。所有这些话的含义都会隐藏起来，除非里面隐藏更深的含义揭开它们。</p>

From what has now been said of Judah, it is very evident that there is an internal sense of the Word, and that unless what this sense involves is known, that which is signified by the things written 
of Judah cannot be known; as that he is a "lion's whelp," that he is "gone up from the prey," that he "bowed and couched as a lion," and "as an old lion;" and what is signified by a "lawgiver from between 
his feet," by "Shiloh," by "binding his young ass unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine," by "washing his clothing in wine, and his covering in the blood of grapes," by "his eyes 
being red with wine, and his teeth white with milk." The meaning of all these things would lie completely hidden, unless they were uncovered by means of a sense that lies deeper. </p>

From what has now been said about Judah it is clearly evident that the Word has an internal sense and that unless a person knows what that sense holds within it, he cannot possibly know what is meant 
by the things said about him here. He cannot know what is meant by the statement that he is a lion's cub who went up from the plunder, crouched, and lay down like a lion, and like an old lion. He cannot 
know what is meant by 'the lawgiver from between his feet', by 'Shiloh', by 'binding his young ass to the vine, and the foal of his she-ass to the outstanding vine', by 'washing his clothing in wine, 
and his garment in the blood of grapes', or by 'his eyes are red from wine, and his teeth white from milk'. What all these things really mean would remain completely hidden from sight unless the sense 
that lies more deeply within were used to uncover them. </p>

Ex his nunc quae de Jehudah dicta sunt, patet manifeste quod sensus internus Verbi sit, et quod nisi sciatur quid sensus ille involvit, {1}nullatenus sciri possit quid significant quae ibi de illo, 
ut quid `catulus leonis, quod a praeda ascenderit, curvaverit se, et cubuerit sicut leo, et sicut leo vetulus', quid significat `legislator ab inter pedes ejus', quid `Shiloh', quid `alligare ad vitem 
asellum suum, et ad vitem praestantem filium asinae suae', quid `lavare in vino vestimentum, et in sanguine uvarum velamen', quid `ruber esse oculis a vino, et albus dentibus a lacte'; haec omnia laterent 
prorsus abscondita nisi retegerentur per sensum qui latet altius.   @1 ne hilum$ </p>
