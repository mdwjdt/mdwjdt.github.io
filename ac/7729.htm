<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7729节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7729.</strong>“连一蹄也不留下”表源于良善的真理的任何东西都不可缺乏。这从“蹄”和“不留下”的含义清楚可知：“蹄”是指源于良善的真理，如下文所述；“不留下”是指不可缺乏，即对敬拜主来说不可缺乏。就最接近字义的内义而言，“连一蹄也不留下”表示任何东西都不可缺乏，因为蹄是所有牲畜所共有的；但就更内在的意义而言，“蹄”表示处于最末层级的真理，因而表示感官层面的真理，这真理是最低级的；就反面意义而言，则表示虚假。“蹄”之所以具有这种含义，是因为“脚”表示属世层，“脚底”表示属世层的最末和最低层（参看<a href="2162.htm">2162</a>，<a href="3147.htm">3147</a>，<a href="3761.htm">3761</a>，<a href="3986.htm">3986</a>，<a href="4280.htm">4280</a>，<a href="4938.htm">4938</a>-<a href="4952.htm">4952</a>，<a href="5327.htm">5327</a>，<a href="5328.htm">5328</a>节）；“蹄”所表相同，因为它是牲畜的脚底。“蹄”因表示属世层的最末和最低层，和“脚底”一样，故也表示形成属世层的这一层的真理；因为当论及属世层时，所表示的是它的真理和良善，在反面意义所表示的是它的虚假和邪恶。属世层是由这些形成的，没有它们，它没有任何属性。<br />“蹄”，尤其马蹄表示处于最末和最低层级的真理，也就是感官层面的真理，在反面意义上表示属于同一层级的虚假，这一点可从以下经文看出来。以赛亚书：<br />他的箭快利，他的所有弓也上了弦；马蹄算如火石，车轮好像旋风。（以<br />这论及荒凉的人民；“箭”表示他们用来进行争战的虚假教义，而“弓”表示教义本身（<a href="2686.htm">2686</a>，<a href="2709.htm">2709</a>节）；“马”表示理解力，在此表示败坏的理解力（<a href="2761.htm">2761</a>，<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>，<a href="3217.htm">3217</a>，<a href="5321.htm">5321</a>，<a href="6125.htm">6125</a>，<a href="6534.htm">6534</a>节）。由此明显可知“马蹄”表示什么，即表示处于最末和最低层级的虚假。<br />耶利米书：<br />他的壮马蹄跳的响声和战车隆隆，车轮轰轰。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶47.3.htm">47:3</a>）<br />这论及使非利士人荒凉的人民；“壮马，即马蹄跳的响声”表示虚假与真理的公开争战；“战车”表示虚假的教义。“战车”既表示真理的教义，也表示虚假的教义（参看<a href="5321.htm">5321</a>，<a href="5945.htm">5945</a>节）。<br />以西结书：<br />因他的马匹众多，牠们扬起的尘土遮蔽你。你的墙垣必因骑马的、车轮和和战车的响声震动。他的马蹄必践踏你一切的街道。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结26.10.htm">26:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结26.11.htm">11</a>）<br />这论及使推罗荒凉的尼布甲尼撒；“他的马匹”表示败坏的理解力，如前所述；“骑马的”表示属于这种理解力的概念（<a href="6534.htm">6534</a>节）；“车轮”表示教义的虚假，“战车”是指这种教义，如前所述；“街道”表示真理（<a href="2336.htm">2336</a>节）。由此明显可知，“马蹄”表示虚假。如果这些话里面没有这种含义，经上又为何说“因他的马匹众多，牠们扬起的尘土遮蔽你。你的墙垣必因骑马的、车轮和和战车的响声震动。他的马蹄必践踏你一切的街道”呢？没有内层含义，它们不就是些空洞的声音吗？而事实上，在圣言中，每个词语有分量，因为它在起源上是神性。<br />同一先知书：<br />他们必毁灭埃及的骄傲，使埃及的众民必被灭绝。我必从埃及多水旁除灭所有的走兽，人的脚必不再搅浑这水，兽的蹄也不搅浑这水；那时我必打发他们的水进入深渊，使他们的江河像油缓流。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结32.12.htm">32:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结32.14.htm">14</a>）<br />这些细节也是无法理解的，除非知道“埃及”、“人的脚”、“兽的蹄”、从旁除灭走兽、人的脚和兽的蹄将要搅浑，并被打发进入深渊的“多水”表示什么。“埃及的水和江河”是指记忆知识的真理；“兽的蹄”是指在属世层的最末和最低层面的虚假，这些虚假扰乱记忆知识的真理。<br />弥迦书：<br />锡安的女子哪，起来踹吧！我必使你的角成为铁，使你的蹄成为铜。你必打碎多民。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥4.13.htm">4:13</a>）<br />没有内义，没有人知道这些话表示什么，也就是说，除非知道“踹”、“锡安的女子”、“要变成铁的角”、“要变成铜，用来打碎多民的蹄”表示什么。“锡安的女子”是指属天教会（<a href="2362.htm">2362</a>节）；“角”是指源于良善的真理的能力（<a href="2832.htm">2832</a>节）；“铁”是指将拥有摧毁虚假能力的属世真理（<a href="425.htm">425</a>，<a href="426.htm">426</a>节）；“蹄”是指处于最末和最低层级、源于良善的真理；“铜”是指将拥有战胜邪恶能力的属世良善（<a href="425.htm">425</a>，<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>节）。<br />撒迦利亚书：<br />我要在这地兴起一个牧人，他不看顾将要被剪除的，不寻找年幼的，不医治受伤的，也不牧养强壮的；却要吃肥羊的肉，撕裂它们的蹄子。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚11.16.htm">11:16</a>）<br />这论及愚蠢的牧人；“吃肥羊的肉”表示将良善变成邪恶；“撕裂蹄子”表示将真理变成虚假。<br />古人在聪明上远远胜过现代人，这一点可从以下事实看出来：他们知道世上的许多物体对应于天上的哪些实物，进而知道它们表示什么。不仅属于教会的人知道这种知识，就连教会之外的人也知道，如希腊人；大多数古人运用形像和属灵含义来描绘这些实物。但如今，由于这类含义完全不为人知，所以这些形像被称为了神话。这种对应的知识就存在于古代的圣哲当中，这一点从以下事实明显看出来：他们用一匹他们称之珀伽索斯的有翼飞马来描述聪明和智慧的起源。这匹马用蹄子踏开一个源泉，泉旁有九个处女，这泉在一个小山（即赫利孔山）上。因为他们知道“马”表示理解力，“它的翅膀”表示灵性，“蹄子”表示真理的最末和最低层级，也就是聪明的起源之处，“处女”表示知识的多样性，“小山”表示全体一致，在灵义上表示仁爱；其余的也是如此。不过，如今这类事物成了一些遗失的事物。</p>

There shall not a hoof be left behind. That this signifies that not anything of truth from good shall be lacking, is evident from the signification of "hoof," as being truth from good (of which below); 
and from the signification of "not being left behind," as being not to be lacking, namely, for the worship of the Lord. In the proximate internal sense, by "a hoof not being left behind" is signified 
that nothing at all shall be lacking, because the hoof is common to all beasts; but in a more interior sense by "hoof" is signified truth in the ultimate degree, thus sensuous truth, which is the lowest; 
and in the opposite sense, falsity. That this is the signification of "hoof" is because by the "foot" is signified the natural, and by the "sole of the foot" the ultimate of the natural (see n. 
2162, 3147, 3761, 3986, 4280, 4938-4952, 5327, 5328); and the like is signified by the "hoof," for this is the sole of the foot of beasts. And as the ultimate of the natural is signified by "hoof," as 
by the "sole of the foot," that truth is also signified which is the ultimate truth of the natural, for when the natural is spoken of, its truth and good are meant, or in the opposite sense its falsity 
and evil; from these it is, and without these nothing can be predicated of it. [2] That by the "hoof," especially of horses, is signified truth in the ultimate degree, thus sensuous truth, and in 
the opposite sense falsity of the same degree, can be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Whose arrows are sharp, and all his bows bent, the hoofs of his horses are accounted as the rock, 
his wheels as the whirlwind (Isa. 5:28); </p>
<p>speaking of a devastating people; by "arrows" are signified the doctrinal things of falsity from which combat is waged; and by "bows," this doctrine (n. 2686, 
2709); by "horses," intellectual things here perverted (n. 2761, 2762, 3217, 5321, 6125, 6534). From this it is plain what is meant by the "hoof of the horses," namely, falsity in the ultimate degree. [3] 
In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     For the voices of the beating of the hoofs of his strong ones, for the tumult of his chariot, the rumbling of his wheels (Jer. 47:3); </p>
<p>speaking of a people devastating the 
Philistines; "the beating of the hoofs of the strong ones," namely, of the horses, denotes the open combat of falsity against truth; the "chariot" denotes the doctrine of falsity. (That "chariot" denotes 
doctrine both of truth and of falsity, see n. 5321, 5945.) [4] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee; by reason of the noise of the horsemen and 
of the wheel and of the chariot thy walls shall be shaken. With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets (Ezek. 26:10-11); </p>
<p>speaking of Nebuchadnezzar devastating Tyre; "his horses" 
denote intellectual things perverted, as above; a "horseman" denotes that which pertains to such an intellectual (n. 6534); the "wheels of a chariot" denote falsities of doctrine, a "chariot" being 
doctrine, as above; "streets" denote truths (n. 2336). From this it is evident that the "hoofs of the horses" denote falsities. Unless there were such a signification in these words, why should it be 
said, "By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee; by reason of the noise of the horseman and of the wheel and of the chariot thy walls shall be shaken; with the hoofs of his 
horses shall he tread down all thy streets?" Without an interior sense, would these be more than sounding words? when yet every expression in the Word has weight, because it is from the Divine.  [5] 
In the same: </p>
<p>     They shall devastate the pride of Egypt, that the multitude thereof shall be destroyed; and I will destroy every beast thereof upon many waters, that the foot of man shall not trouble 
them any more, nor shall the hoof of beast trouble them; then will I send their waters into the deep, and make their streams flow as oil (Ezek. 32:12-14); </p>
<p>neither would these words be understood 
unless it were known what is meant by "Egypt," by "the foot of man," what by "the hoof of beast," what by "the waters upon which the beast shall be destroyed, and which the foot of man and the hoof of 
beast shall trouble, and which shall be sent into the deep;" the "waters and streams of Egypt" denote truths of memory-knowledge; "the hoof of beast" denotes falsity in the ultimate of the natural, which 
disturbs the truth of memory-knowledge. [6] In Micah: </p>
<p>     Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion, for I will make thy horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass, that thou mayest break in pieces 
many peoples (Micah 4:13); </p>
<p>what these words mean no one can know without the internal sense, thus unless it is known what is meant by "threshing," by the "daughter of Zion," by the "horn which shall 
become as iron," by the "hoof which shall become as brass, with which many peoples shall be broken in pieces." The "daughter of Zion" denotes the celestial church (n. 2362); the "horn" denotes the power 
of truth from good (n. 2832); "iron" denotes natural truth which shall avail to destroy falsities (n. 425, 426); "hoof" denotes truth from good in the ultimate degree; "brass" denotes natural good 
which shall avail against evils (n. 425, 1551). [7] In Zechariah: </p>
<p>     I will stir up a shepherd in the land, he shall not visit those who are to be cut off, her that is of tender age he shall not 
seek, and her that is broken he shall not heal, but he shall eat up the flesh of the fat one, and shall cleave asunder their hoofs (Zech. 11:16); </p>
<p>speaking of a foolish shepherd; "to eat up the flesh 
of the fat one" denotes to turn good into evil; "to cleave asunder the hoofs" denotes to turn truth into falsity. [8] How much the ancients surpassed the moderns in intelligence can be seen from the 
fact that they knew to what things in heaven many things in the world correspond, and consequently what they signify; and this was known not only to those of the church, but also to those out of the church, 
as for instance to the inhabitants of Greece, the most ancient of whom described things by significatives which at this day are called fabulous, because wholly unknown. That the ancient Sophi were 
in the knowledge of such things is evident from the fact that they described the origin of intelligence and wisdom by a winged horse which they called Pegasus, who with his hoof broke open a fountain, 
at which were nine virgins, and this upon a hill; for they knew that by a "horse" was signified the intellectual, by his "wings" the spiritual, by "hoofs" truth of the ultimate degree, where is the 
origin of intelligence, by "virgins" the sciences, by a "hill" unanimity, and in the spiritual sense charity. So with everything else. But such things at this day are among the things that have been lost. </p>

'Not a hoof shall be left behind' means that nothing at all of the truth from good shall be lacking. This is clear from the meaning of 'a hoof' as truth from good, dealt with below; and from the meaning 
of 'not being left behind' as not to be lacking, that is, from worship of the Lord. In the internal sense nearest to the literal 'not a hoof shall be left behind' means that nothing whatever shall 
be lacking, for the hoof is common to all livestock. But in the sense more internal than that 'a hoof means truth in the last degree - that is, truth on the level of the senses, which is the lowest - 
and in the contrary sense falsity. The reason why 'a hoof' has this meaning is that 'foot' means the natural, and 'sole of the foot' the last and lowest level of the natural, <a href="2162.htm">2162</a>, <a href="3147.htm">3147</a>, <a href="3761.htm">3761</a>, <a href="3986.htm">3986</a>, <a href="4280.htm">4280</a>, <a href="4938.htm">4938</a>-<a href="4952.htm">4952</a>, <a href="5327.htm">5327</a>, <a href="5728.htm">5728</a>, much the same being meant by 'hoof' since it is the sole of the foot in the case of livestock. And because the last and lowest level of the natural is meant by 'hoof' as it 
is by 'sole', truth forming that level of the natural is also meant; for when the natural is spoken of, truth and good are meant, or in the contrary sense falsity and evil. The natural is formed from 
these, and without them is devoid of any attributes. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that 'hoof', in particular that of a horse, means truth in the last and lowest degree, that is, truth on the level of the senses, 
and in the contrary sense falsity belonging to the same degree, becomes clear from the following places: In Isaiah, </p>
<p>Whose arrows are sharp, and all bows bent. His horses' hoofs are considered as flint, 
his wheels as the whirlwind. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%205:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 5:18</a>. </p>
<p>This refers to a people laying waste. 'Arrows' means ideas fired from false doctrine, which they use to fight with, and 'bow' the doctrine itself, <a href="2686.htm">2686</a>, 
<a href="2709.htm">2709</a>. 'Horses' means powers of understanding, in this instance perverted ones, <a href="2761.htm">2761</a>, <a href="2762.htm">2762</a>, <a href="3117.htm">3117</a>, <a href="5321.htm">5321</a>, <a href="6125.htm">6125</a>, <a href="6534.htm">6534</a>. Which shows what 'the hoofs' of the horses means, namely falsity in the last and lowest 
degree.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
. . . because of the sound of the beat of the hoofs of his mighty ones, on account of the noise of his chariot, the rumble of his wheels. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2047:3%20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 47:3 </a> 
</blockquote>
<p> This refers 
to a people laying the Philistines waste. 'The beat of the hoofs of his mighty ones', that is, of horses, stands for open conflict of falsity against truth. 'Chariot' stands for teachings maintaining 
falsity, for 'a chariot' means teachings that maintain either truth or falsity, see <a href="5321.htm">5321</a>, <a href="5945.htm">5945</a> </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust will cover you; by reason of 
the noise of horsemen, and wheels, and chariots, your walls will be shaken; by means of the hoofs of his horses he will trample all your streets. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2026:10,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 26:10, 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Nebuchadnezzar laying 
Tyre waste. 'Horses' stands for perverted powers of understanding, as above, 'horsemen' for concepts that go with that kind of understanding, <a href="6534.htm">6534</a>. 'The wheels' that the chariots have stands for the 
falsities that are taught, 'chariot' being such teaching, as above, while 'streets' stands for truths, <a href="2336.htm">2336</a>. From this it is evident that 'the hoofs of horses' stands for falsities. If such were not 
meant, what would be the point of the statement 'by reason of the abundance of his horses their dust will cover you; by reason of the noise of horsemen, and wheels, and chariots, your walls will be shaken; 
by means of the hoofs of his horses he will trample all your streets'? Without an inner meaning would they be anything more than empty sounds? In actual fact every expression used in the Word, 
being Divine in origin, carries weight. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<p>They will devastate the pride of Egypt, in order that its multitude may be destroyed. And I will destroy all its beasts over many 
waters, in order that the foot of man (homo) may not disturb them any more, nor the hoof of beast disturb them. Then I will turn their waters into a depth,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and cause their rivers to flow like oil. Ezek. 
32:12-14. </p>
<p>Nor are these details intelligible unless one knows what is meant by 'Egypt', by 'the foot of man', by 'the hoof of beast', by 'waters' over which beasts will be destroyed, which the 
foot of man and hoof of beast will disturb, and which will be turned into a depth. Waters and rivers of Egypt are collections of true factual knowledge, while 'the hoof of beast' is falsity on the last 
and lowest level of the natural that disturbs true factual knowledge. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In Micah, </p>
<blockquote>
Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion, for I will make your horn iron, and I will make your hoofs bronze, in 
order that you may crush many peoples. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Micah%204:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Micah 4:13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Nor can anyone know without the internal sense what these things are, that is, unless he knows what is meant by 'threshing', 'daughter of Zion', 
'horn that will be made like iron', 'hoof that will be made like bronze', both of which will be used 'to crush many peoples'. 'Daughter of Zion' is the celestial Church, <a href="1362.htm">1362</a>; 'horn' is the power of truth 
that springs from good, <a href="2832.htm">2832</a>; 'iron' is natural truth that will have the ability to destroy falsities, <a href="425.htm">425</a>, <a href="426.htm">426</a>; 'hoof' is truth that springs from good in the last and lowest degree; and 'bronze' 
is natural good that will have power over evils, <a href="425.htm">425</a>, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 In Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will raise up a shepherd in the land; he will not go<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> to [the sheep] that are to be cut off, he will not seek one 
tender in age, and he will not heal one that is maimed.<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> But he will eat the flesh of the fat, and tear apart their hoofs. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%2011:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 11:16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to a stupid shepherd. 'Eating the flesh of the 
fat' stands for turning good into evil, 'tearing apart the hoofs' for turning truth into falsity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 How superior in intelligence the ancients were to people at the present day becomes clear from 
the consideration that in regard to very many objects in the world they knew which realities in heaven they corresponded to, and therefore what their spiritual meanings were. This knowledge existed 
not only with those who belonged to the Church but also with those outside the Church, such as the people in Greece, the most ancient of whom employed images with spiritual meanings to depict those realities. 
But at the present day, since such meanings are entirely unknown, those images are called myths. Knowledge of such correspondences among the sages of old is evident from the fact that they spoke 
of a winged horse, which they called Pegasus, to depict the rise of intelligence and wisdom. With its hoof it broke open a fountain, at which there were nine virgins, and which was situated on a hill. 
For they knew that 'the horse' was a sign of the power of understanding, 'its wings' a sign of spirituality, 'its hoofs' a sign of the last and lowest degree of truth, which gave rise to intelligence, 
'virgins' a sign of varieties of knowledge, 'hill' a sign of unanimity, and in the spiritual sense of charity, and so on with the rest. But such matters at the present day are some of those that 
are lost.

patet quid `ungula equorum,' quod nempe sit falsum 3 in ultimo gradu: apud Jeremiam, Prae voce plausus ungularum fortium ejus, ob tumultum currui ejus, strepitum rotarum ejus, xlvii 3; </p>
<p>ibi de populo 
vastante Philisthaeos; `plausus ungularum fortium,' nempe equorum, pro {9}pugna aperta falsi contra verum; `currus' pro doctrina falsi; quod `currus' sit doctrina {10}tam veri quam falsi, videatur 4 
n. 5321, 5945: apud Ezechielem, Prae abundantia equorum ejus obteget te pulvis eorum, prae voce equitis et rotae et currus commovebuntur muri tui, per ungulas equorum suorum conculcabit omnes plateas 
tuas, xxvi 10, 11; </p>
<p>ibi de Nebuchadnezare vastante Tyrum; `equi' pro intellectualibus perversis, ut supra, `eques' pro illis quae sunt talis intellectualis, n. 6534; `rotae quae currus' pro falsis doctrinae; 
`currus' est doctrina, ut supra, `plateae' pro veris, n. 2336; inde patet quod `ungulae equorum' sint falsa; {11}nisi talia significentur, {12} quid forent illa `prae abundantia equorum ejus 
obteget te pulvis eorum; prae voce equitis et rotae et currus commovebuntur muri tui, per ungulas equorum {13}suorum conculcabit omnes plateas {14}tuas,' annon absque sensu interiore forent aliud quam 
voces sonantes, cum tamen {15}unaquaevis vox in Verbo pondus habet, quia a Divino: apud eundem, 5 Devastabunt superbiam Aegypti, ut perdatur multitudo ejus; et perdam omnem bestiam ejus super aquis 
multis, ut non turbet illas pes hominis amplius, nec ungula bestiae turbet illas; tunc in profundum mittam aquas illorum, et flumina (c)illorum sicut oleum fluere faciam, xxxii 12-14; </p>
<p>haec nec intelligerentur 
{16} nisi sciatur {17}quid `Aegyptus,' {18} quid `pes hominis,' quid `ungula bestiae,' {19}quid aquae super quibus perdetur bestia, quas turbabit pes hominis et ungula bestiae, et quae in profundum 
mittentur; `aquae et flumina Aegypti' sunt vera scientifica, `ungula bestiae' est falsum in ultimo naturalis, quod turbat scientificum verum: apud Micham, 6 Surge et tritura, filia Zionis, quia 
cornu tuum faciam ferrum, et ungulas tuas faciam aes, ut comminuas populos multos, iv 13; </p>
<p>haec {20} quid sunt, nec quisquam scire potest absque sensu interno, ita nisi sciatur quid `triturare,' quid 
`filia Zionis,' quid `cornu {21}quod fiet sicut ferrum,' quid `ungula quae fiet sicut aes, quibus comminuentur populi multi'; `filia Zionis' est Ecclesia caelestis, n. 2362; `cornu' est potentia veri 
ex bono, n. 2832; `ferrum' est verum naturale quod valebit ad destruendum falsa, n. 425, 426; `ungula' est verum ex bono in ultimo gradu, `aes' est bonum naturale quod valebit contra mala, n. 425, 
1551: apud Sachariam, 7 Ego excitabo pastorem in terra, exscindendas non visitabit, aetate teneram non quaeret, et fractam non sanabit; carnem autem pinguis comedet, et ungulas earum diffindet, xi 16; </p>
<p>ibi 
de pastore stulto; `carnem pinguis comedere' pro bonum in malum vertere, `ungulas diffindere' pro verum in falsum. 	8 Quantum antiqui intelligentia praevaluerunt hodiernis, constare 8 potest 
ex eo quod illi noverint {22}quibus rebus in caelo plura in mundo corresponderent, et inde quid significarent; et hoc non solum noverunt illi qui ab Ecclesia fuerunt, sed etiam qui extra Ecclesiam, sicut 
qui in Graecia, quorum antiquissimi (t)descripserunt res per significativa quae hodie, quia prorsus ignota, vocantur fabulosa; quod antiqui sophi in scientia talium fuerint, patet ex eo quod originem 
intelligentiae et sapientiae descripserint per equum alatum, quem Pegasum vocarunt, quod ille {23}ungula sua eruperit fontem, {24}apud quem novem virgines, et hoc super colle; sciverunt enim quod 
per `equum' significaretur intellectuale, per `alas ejus' spirituale, per `ungulas' verum ultimi gradus, {25}ubi origo intelligentiae, per `virgines' scientiae, per `collem' unanimitas, et in sensu spirituali 
charitas; {26} sic in reliquis.  Sed talia hodie inter deperdita sunt. 	@1 After proximo$ 	@2 infimum et communissimum$ 	@3 in Verbo passim nominatur ungula, et per illam$ 	@4 in ultimo gradu
