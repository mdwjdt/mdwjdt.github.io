<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2531节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2531.</strong>“所以我不容许你接触她”表根本不请教理性。这从“容许接触”和此处代词“她”所指作为妹子的撒拉的含义清楚可知：“容许接触”是指请教，这也是“亲近她”的含义（20:4，2519节）；作为妹子的撒拉是指理性（参看<a href="1495.htm">1495</a>，<a href="2508.htm">2508</a>节）。<br />信之教义是属灵的，来自属天的源头。为进一步了解它的性质，要知道，这种教义是来自神性良善的神性真理，因而完全是神性。神性之物是无法理解的，因为它超出一切理解，甚至走出天使的理解；但这本身无法理解的神性仍能经由主的神圣人性进入人类理性。它流入人类理性时，会在那里照着其中的真理被接受。因此，它以各种方式被接受，因人而异。故人所具有的真理越纯正，流入的神性也越完美地被接受，其心智的理解力部分也越得到启示。<br />真理本身存在于主的圣言中，但字面上的真理适合那些具有外在敬拜的人来理解；而内义上的真理则适合那些系内在人，也就是在教义和生活方面像天使那样的人来理解。他们的理性由此得到启示，甚至到了这种启示好比众星和太阳的光辉的程度（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但12.3.htm">12:3</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.43.htm">13:43</a>）。这表明认识并接受内在真理何等重要。诚然，人们能认识这些真理，但除了那些爱主或信主之人外，没人能接受它们。主是神性良善，故也是神性真理，因而是教义本身，因为正信的教义所包含的一切事物都关注主，也关注天国和教会，以及天国和教会的一切事物。不过，所有这些都是主的，是中间目的，最终目的，也就是主，通过这中间目的被关注。<br />就真理与良善而言，主是教义本身，因此唯独祂在教义中被关注，祂自己在约翰福音中教导：<br />耶稣说，我就是道路、真理、生命。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.6.htm">14:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.7.htm">7</a>）<br />此处“道路”表教义，“真理”表构成教义的一切事物，“生命”表良善本身，也就是真理的生命。爱主或信主者就是那接受者，祂还在约翰福音中教导：<br />祂自己的人却不接受祂。凡接待祂的，就是信祂名的人，祂就赐他们权柄，作神的儿女。这等人不是从血气生的，不是从情欲生的，也不是从人意生的，乃是从神生的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.11.htm">1:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.13.htm">13</a>）<br />“从神生的”就是那些有爱并由此有信之人。</p>

Therefore I did not suffer thee to touch her. That this signifies that the rational was not at all consulted, is evident from the signification of "suffering to touch," as being to consult (as is also 
meant by "coming near her" in verse 4, n. 2519); and from the signification of "Sarah as a sister," who is here meant, as being the rational (see n. 1495, 2508). [2] That it may be further known how 
the case is with the doctrine of faith, as being spiritual from a celestial origin, be it known that it is Divine truth from Divine good, and thus wholly Divine. What is Divine is incomprehensible, 
because above all understanding, even the angelic; but still this Divine, which in itself is incomprehensible, can flow in through the Lord's Divine Human into man's rational; and when it flows into his 
rational, it is there received according to the truths which are therein; thus variously, and not with one as with another. Insofar therefore as the truths with a man are more genuine, so far the Divine 
which flows in is received more perfectly, and so far the man's understanding is enlightened. [3] In the Lord's Word are Truths themselves; but in its literal sense are truths which are accommodated 
to the apprehension of those who are in external worship; whereas in its internal sense are truths accommodated to those who are internal men; that is, to those who are angelic as to doctrine and 
at the same time as to life. Their rational is enlightened therefrom to such a degree that their enlightenment is compared to the brightness of the stars and the sun (Dan. 12:3; Matt. 13:43). Hence 
it is plain how important it is that interior truths be known and received. These truths may indeed be known, but by no means received, except by those who have love to the Lord, or faith in Him; for 
as the Lord is the Divine good, so He is the Divine truth; consequently He is doctrine itself, since whatever is in the doctrine of true faith looks to the Lord, and looks also to the heavenly kingdom 
and the church, and to all things of the heavenly kingdom and the church. But all these are His, and are the intermediate ends through which the last end, that is, the Lord, is regarded. [4] That the 
Lord is doctrine itself as to truth and good, and thus that it is He who alone is regarded in doctrine, He teaches John: </p>
<p>     Jesus said, I am the way, the Truth, and the Life (John 14:6, 7); </p>
<p>where 
the "Way" is doctrine, the "Truth" all that is of doctrine, and the "Life" the good itself which is the life of the truth. And that love to Him or faith in Him is what receives, He also teaches in John: </p>
<p> 
    His own received Him not; but as many as received Him, to them gave He power to be the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name who were born, not of bloods, nor of the will of the 
flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God (John 1:11-13). Those are "born of God" who are in love and thence in faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2531</b></p><p><b>2531.</b>
'Therefore I did not allow you to touch her' means that the rational was not consulted at all. This is clear from the meaning of 'allowing to touch' as consulting- as is also the meaning of 'coming near 
her', verse 4 above, in <a href="2519.htm">2519</a> - and from the meaning of 'Sarah as a sister', to whom the pronoun 'her' refers here, as the rational, dealt with in <a href="1495.htm">1495</a>, <a href="2508.htm">2508</a> </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 So that more may be known about 
the nature of the doctrine of faith, that it is spiritual from a celestial origin, it should be recognized that such doctrine is Divine truth from Divine good, and so is wholly Divine. That which is Divine 
is beyond comprehension since it surpasses all understanding, even that of angels. Nevertheless this Divine, which in itself is beyond comprehension, is able to flow in by way of the Lord's Divine 
Human into man's rational. And when it flows into his rational, the way it is received there is determined by the truths that are there. Thus it is received in varying ways, differently from one person 
to another. To the extent therefore that the truths residing with a person are more genuine, the Divine flowing in is also received more perfectly, and the understanding part of his mind is enlightened. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
Present within the Word of the Lord there are truths themselves, but in its literal sense there are truths which have been adapted to the mental grasp of those whose worship is external, 
while in its internal sense there are truths adapted to those who are internal people, that is, who as regards doctrine and at the same time as regards life are like angels. Their rational is as a result 
enlightened to such an extent that this enlightenment is compared to the brightness of the stars and of the sun, in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%2012:%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 12: 3</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:%2043&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13: 43</a>. This shows how important it is to know and receive interior 
truths. People can indeed know these truths, but none can possibly receive them except those who are governed by love to the Lord or by faith in Him. For as the Lord is Divine Good, so He is Divine 
Truth, and therefore doctrine itself, for everything included in the doctrine of true faith has regard to the Lord. It also has regard to the heavenly kingdom and the Church, and to the things that 
constitute the heavenly kingdom and the Church. But all these are His and are the intermediate ends by means of which the final end, that is, the Lord, is regarded. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 That the Lord is doctrine 
itself as regards truth and good, thus that it is He alone who is regarded in doctrine, He Himself teaches in John, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:-6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:-6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the 
way' means doctrine, 'the truth' everything that constitutes doctrine, 'the life' good itself which is the life of truth. And that love to Him or faith in Him is that which receives, He also teaches in 
John, </p>
<blockquote>
His own did not receive him. But as many as received Him, to them He gave power to be sons of God, to those believing in His name, who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, 
nor of the will of man, but of God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:-11-13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:-11-13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The born of God' are those in whom love and, from this, faith are present. </p>

Quod `propterea non dedi tibi ad attingendum ad illam' significet quod nihil rationale sit consultum, constat a significatione `dare ad attingendum' quod sit consulere, ut quoque appropinquare ad illam 
supra vers. 4, n. 2519; et a significatione `Sarae ut sororis' quae hic est `illa,' quod sit rationale, de qua n. 1495, 2508.  [2] Ut ulterius sciatur quomodo se habet cum doctrina fidei, quod illa 
sit spiritualis ex origine caelesti, sciendum quod illa sit Verum Divinum ex Bono Divino, `ita in totum Divina: quod Divinum est, incomprehensibile est quia supra omnem intellectum, etiam angelicum; 
sed usque hoc Divinum quod in se incomprehensibile, per Divinum Humanum Domini influere potest in rationale hominis, `et dum influit in ejus rationale, ibi recipitur secundum vera quae ibi, ita diversimode 
et aliter apud unum quam apud alterum; quantum itaque vera quae apud hominem, sunt magis genuina, tantum etiam perfectius recipitur Divinum quod influit, et tantum illustratur intellectuale hominis: 
in Verbo Domini sunt ipsa vera; [3] at in sensu ejus litterali sunt vera quae accommodata sunt ad captum eorum qui in externo cultu sunt; at in sensu ejus interno, sunt vera accommodata iis qui 
interni homines sunt, qui nempe quoad doctrinam et simul vitam sunt angelici; eorum rationale inde illustratur in tantum ut illustratio comparetur splendori stellarum (c)et solis, Dan. xii 3; Matth. xiii 
43; inde patet quanti interest ut interiora vera sciantur et recipiantur; haec vera sciri quidem possunt, sed nusquam recipi nisi ab illis qui in amore aut in fide in Dominum sunt; Dominus enim, sicut 
est Divinum Bonum, ita est Divinum Verum, proinde est ipsa doctrina, nam quicquid est in doctrina verae fidei, Dominum spectant, spectant etiam regnum caeleste et Ecclesiam, et quae sunt regni caelestis 
et Ecclesiae, sed illa sunt omnia Ipsius, ac sunt (x)fines intermedii per quos spectatur ultimus, hoc est, Dominus: [4] quod Dominus sit ipsa doctrina' quoad verum et bonum, ita Qui solus spectatur 
in doctrina, Ipse docet apud Johannem, 	Jesus dixit, Ego sum Via, Veritas et Vita, (x)xiv 6, 7; </p>
<p>ubi `via' est doctrina, `veritas' omne quod est doctrinae, `vita' ipsum bonum quod vita est veri; 
et quod amor aut fides in Ipsum recipiat apud Johannem, 	Proprii Ipsum non receperunt; quotquot vero receperunt, dedit illis potestatem ut filii Dei essent, credentibus in 	nomen Ipsius; qui non ex 
sanguinibus, neque e voluntate carnis, neque e voluntate viri, sed ex Deo nati sunt, i 11-13; </p>
<p>`a Deo nati' sunt illi qui in amore et inde in fide. 	@1 i ac.$ </p>
