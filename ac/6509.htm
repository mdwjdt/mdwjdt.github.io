Verses 4-6. And the days of weeping for him passed away, and Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If I pray I have found grace in your eyes, speak I pray in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, My 
father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die; in my sepulcher which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me; and now I pray let me go up, and bury my father, and I will return. 
And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear. "And the days of weeping for him passed away," signifies that the states of sorrow were accomplished; "and Joseph spake 
unto the house of Pharaoh," signifies the influx of the internal into the natural mind; "saying, If I pray I have found grace in your eyes," signifies that it may be well received; "speak I pray in the 
ears of Pharaoh, saying," signifies entreaty for consent; "My father made me swear," signifies that he has the church at heart; "saying, Lo, I die," signifies that it had ceased to be; "in my sepulcher 
which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me," signifies that it was to be resuscitated where the former church had been; "and now I pray let me go up, and bury my father," 
signifies the resuscitation of the church there by the internal; "and I will return," signifies presence in the natural mind; "and Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father," signifies affirmation 
that the church will be resuscitated; "according as he made thee swear," signifies because this is at heart. </p>

Verses 4-6 And the days of weeping for him passed, and Joseph spoke to Pharaoh's house, saying, If now I have found favour in your eyes, speak, I beg you, in Pharaoh's ears, saying, My father made me 
swear on oath, saying, Behold, I am dying; in my grave which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan, there you are to bury me. And now let me go up, I beg you, and bury my father, and I will return. 
And Pharaoh said, Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear on oath. </p>
<p>'And the days of weeping for him passed' means that the states of sorrow were completed. 'And Joseph spoke to Pharaoh's house' 
means an influx of the internal into the natural mind. 'Saying, If now I have found favour in your eyes' means so that it may be well received. 'Speak, I beg you, in Pharaoh's ears, saying' means 
an anxious plea that it should consent to it. 'My father made me swear on oath' means that he has the Church at heart. 'Saying, Behold, I am dying' means that it has come to an end. 'In my grave which 
I dug for myself in the land of Canaan, there you are to bury me' means that it was to be restored to life where the previous one had existed. 'And now let me go up, I beg you, and bury my father' 
means a restoration to life of the Church there by the internal. 'And I will return' means presence in the natural mind. 'And Pharaoh said, Go up and bury your father' means an affirmation that the Church 
is to be restored to life. 'As he made you swear on oath' means because he had it at heart. </p>

Vers. 4-6.  Et transiverunt dies fletus ejus; et locutus Joseph ad domum Pharaonis, dicendo, Si quaeso inveni gratiam in oculis vestris, loquimini quaeso in auribus Pharaonis, dicendo.  Pater meus adjuravit 
me, dicendo, Ecce ego morior, in sepulcro meo, quod fodi mihi in terra Canaan, ibi sepelias me; et nunc ascendam quaeso, et sepeliam patrem meum, et revertar.  Et dixit Pharaoh, Ascende et sepeli 
patrem tuum, quemadmodum adjuravit te.  `Et transiverunt dies fletus ejus' significat quod status maestitiae transacti sint:  `et locutus Joseph ad domum Pharaonis' significat influxum interni in 
mentem naturalem:  `dicendo, Si quaeso inveni gratiam in oculis vestris' significat ut bene recipiatur: `loquimini quaeso in auribus Pharaonis, dicendo' significat sollicitationem ut consentiat:  `Pater 
meus adjuravit me' significat quod Ecclesia cordi sit: `dicendo, Ecce ego morior' significat quod desiit esse:  `in sepulcro meo, quod fodi mihi in terra Canaan, ibi sepelias me' significat quod resuscitanda 
ubi prior fuerat:  `et nunc ascendam quaeso, et sepeliam patrem meum'  significat resuscitationem Ecclesiae ibi ab interno:  `et revertar' significat praesentiam in mente naturali:  `et dixit 
Pharaoh, Ascende et sepeli patrem tuum' significat affirmationem ut resuscitetur Ecclesia:  `quemadmodum adjuravit te' significat quia illa cordi. </p>
