<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3766节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3766.</strong>“田间”表教会。这从“田间”的含义清楚可知，“田间”是指良善方面的教会（<a href="2971.htm">2971</a>节）。在圣言中，教会由“陆地”（land）、“土地”（ground）和“田地”（field）来表示，不过，各自含义有所区别。“田”表教会的原因在于，教会像一块田那样接受良善与真理的种子；因为教会拥有圣言，这些种子出自圣言。这就是为何田里的每一事物都表示教会某个方面的原因，如耕种、收割、未割或站着的庄稼、大小麦等等。不过，它们各自的含义也是有所区别的。</p>

In the field. That this signifies for the churches, is evident from the signification of a "field," as being the church as to good (n. 2971). In the Word the church is signified by "land," "ground," 
and "field," but with a difference. The reason why "field" signifies the church, is that the church as a field receives the seeds of good and truth; for the church has the Word, from which come these 
seeds; and this is the reason why everything in a field signifies that which is of the church, such as sowing, reaping, standing corn, wheat, barley, and other things, and this also with a difference. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3766</b></p><p><b>3766.</b>
'In the field' means provided for the Churches. This is clear from the meaning of 'the field' as the Church as regards good, dealt with in <a href="2971.htm">2971</a>. In the Word the Church is meant by the expressions 'land', 
'ground', and 'the field', though each has a different shade of meaning. The reason 'the field' means the Church is that like a field it receives the seeds of goodness and truth; for the Church has 
the Word, the source of those seeds. This also is why everything included in the field means some aspect of the Church, such as that which is sown, that which is harvested, standing grain, wheat, barley, 
and everything else. And each of these too has a different shade of meaning. </p>

</p><b>3766.</b>
`In agro': quod significet pro Ecclesiis, constat ex significatione `agri' quod sit Ecclesia quoad bonum, de qua n. 2971; Ecclesia in Verbo significatur per terram, per humum, et per agrum, at cum 
differentia; quod `ager' sit Ecclesia, est inde quia illa sicut ager recipit semina boni et veri; Ecclesia enim Verbum habet, e quo illa; inde quoque est quod quicquid in agro est, etiam significet 
id quod est Ecclesiae, sicut sementis, messis, seges, triticum, hordeum, et reliqua, et quoque haec cum differentia. </p>
