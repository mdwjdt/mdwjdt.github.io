<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>661.</strong>“毁灭天下一切有生命之灵的血肉”表示，上古教会的所有后代要毁灭自己。这一点从刚才所述清楚可知，也可从前面有关他们的描述明显看出来：他们通过遗传从其先祖那里逐步获得这样一种特质，即他们比任何人都充满可怖的信念。这主要是因为，他们将自己所掌握的信之教义浸没于其欲望中，在这样做的时候变得如此。而那些没有信之教义、完全活在无知中的人则截然不同。这些人不会做出这种事，因此不能亵渎神圣事物，进而关闭余留的道路。所以，他们不能驱离主的天使。<br />②如前所述，余留是人从主那里获取，并从小习得的一切纯真、一切仁爱、一切怜悯和一切信之真理。这些事物的每一个都被珍藏起来。若人没有获得它们，纯真、仁爱或怜悯不可能存在于他的言行中，因而良善与真理根本不可能存在，以致他甚至比凶猛的野兽还要糟糕。若他原本有这类事物的余留，却以污秽的欲望和可怖的虚假信念封闭了这条路，以至于余留无法运作，他的情形也是如此。毁灭自己的大洪前的人就具有这种性质，“毁灭天下一切有生命之灵的血肉”就是指他们。<br />③前面说过，“血肉”总体上表整个人类，具体表肉体人。“有生命之灵”总体上表一切生命，但严格意义上说，它表示已重生之人的生命，因而此处表示上古教会的最后一代。他们被称为“有生命之灵”，或“鼻孔有生命之灵气息的”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创7.22.htm">7:22</a>），因为尽管他们身上不再存留信之生命，但他们仍从其先祖那里获得了他们所扼杀的教会的些许种子。“天下的血肉”表示纯肉体之物，“天堂”是构成人对真理的觉知和对良善的意愿之物。当这些事物与肉体之物分离时，人就无法再存活。支撑人的是他与天堂的结合，即通过天堂与主的结合。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]661.</strong> The meaning of to destroy all flesh (all that has the breath of life in it) under the heavens as the fact that all the descendants of the earliest church destroyed themselves can be seen from what was just said. It can also be seen from earlier sections [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_661/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_560" target=_top>560</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_661/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_562" target=_top>562-563</a>] describing how the mentality that the same people inherited cumulatively from their forebears made them more disposed than others to soak up monstrous convictions of this type. The main reason was that they immersed the religious teachings they possessed in the torrent of their desires and so took on this disposition.<br />Circumstances are different for those who have never learned what the true faith teaches but live in complete ignorance. They cannot do as that church did; they have no way of profaning holy things and so blocking off access to the remnant within themselves. As a result, they do not drive the Lord's angels away.<br />[2] The remnant within us, as already stated [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_661/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_561" target=_top>561</a>], includes every lesson in innocence, in charity, in mercy, and in religious truth that we have received from the Lord since childhood. Each and every trace of those lessons is stored away. Without them, innocence, charity, and mercy would be wholly absent from our thinking and our actions. In that case, nothing good or true would be present, and we would be worse than savage beasts. The outcome would be the same if a remnant of these qualities did stay with us but unclean desires and dreadful, misconceived persuasions blocked its outlet, preventing it from operating. That is what happened with the people predating the Flood who exterminated themselves. They are the ones meant by all flesh (all that has the breath of life in it) under the heavens.<br />[3] Flesh symbolizes all people in general, and body-centered people in particular, as shown already [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_661/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_574" target=_top>574</a>]. The breath of life symbolizes all life in general, but strictly speaking, it is the life in those who have been reborn. Here, then, it symbolizes the final generation of the earliest church. Although no living faith survived in them, they still had acquired from their ancestors a germ of that faith — which they smothered. It is here called the breath of life; in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_661/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_22" target=_top>Genesis 7:22</a>, it is referred to in the phrase, "in whose nostrils was the breath of living spirit."<br />Flesh under the heavens symbolizes what is limited to our bodily plane, whereas the heavens are the truth that we understand and the good that we will. Once our bodily concerns are disconnected from truth in the intellect and good in the will, we can no longer remain alive. What sustains us is the bond we have with heaven, that is, with the Lord through heaven. </p>

To destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of lives from under the heavens. That this signifies that the whole posterity of the Most Ancient Church would destroy themselves, is evident from what is said 
above, and from the description of them given before: that they derived by inheritance from their parents in succession such a genius that they more than others were imbued with direful persuasions; 
and especially for the reason that they immersed the doctrinal things of faith that they possessed in their cupidities. It is otherwise with those who have no doctrinal things of faith, but live entirely 
in ignorance; these cannot so act, and therefore cannot profane holy things, and thereby close up the way for remains; and consequently they cannot drive away from themselves the angels of the 
Lord. [2] Remains, as has been said, are all things of innocence, all things of charity, all things of mercy, and all things of the truth of faith, which from his infancy a man has had from the Lord, 
and has learned. Each and all of these things are treasured up; and if a man had them not, there could be nothing of innocence, of charity, and of mercy, and therefore nothing of good and truth in his 
thought and actions, so that he would be worse than the savage wild beasts. And it would be the same if he had had the remains of such things and had closed up the way by foul cupidities and direful 
persuasions of falsity, so that they could not operate. Such were the antediluvians who destroyed themselves, and who are meant by "all flesh wherein is the breath of lives, under the heavens." [3] "Flesh" 
as before shown, signifies every man in general, and the corporeal man in particular. The "breath of lives" signifies all life in general, but properly the life of those who have been regenerated, 
consequently in the present case the last posterity of the Most Ancient Church. Although there was no life of faith remaining among them, yet as they derived from their parents something of seed therefrom 
which they stifled, it is here called the "breath of lives" or (as in Gen. 7:22) "in whose nostrils was the breathing of the breath of lives." "Flesh under the heavens" signifies what is merely 
corporeal; the "heavens" are the things of the understanding that are of truth and the things of the will that are of good, on the separation of which from the corporeal a man can no longer live. What 
sustains man is his conjunction with heaven, that is, through heaven with the Lord. </p>

'To destroy all flesh in which there is the spirit of life<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> [from] under the heavens' means that all the descendants of the Most Ancient Church would destroy themselves. This is clear from what has just 
been stated and also from the description of them given already to the effect that step by step they obtained by heredity from their forefathers a mental constitution that resulted in their being 
steeped more than anybody else in most dreadful persuasions. This came about chiefly because they plunged into their desires the doctrinal matters concerning faith which they had in their possession; 
and in so doing became such. The situation has been utterly different with people who have no doctrinal matters concerning faith in their possession and who live altogether in ignorance. They are incapable 
of doing the same, and so are incapable of profaning holy things, and in so doing of closing off the road for remnants. Consequently they are not capable of driving the Lord's angels away from themselves. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
As has been stated, remnants are all things of innocence, all those of charity, all those of mercy, and all those of the truth of faith, which a person has acquired from the Lord and 
learned since early childhood. Every single one of them lies stored away. And if a person did not acquire them, no innocence, charity, or mercy could possibly be present in his thinking and actions, 
and so no good and truth at all could be present. He would then be worse than any fierce monster, as he would also be if he did possess remnants of such things and yet so blocked their path with filthy 
desires and dreadful false persuasions that they could not do their work. Such was the nature of the people before the Flood who destroyed themselves and who are meant by 'all flesh in which there is 
the spirit of life<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> [from] under the heavens'. As shown already, 'flesh' means the whole of mankind in general and the bodily-minded man in particular. 'The spirit of life<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>' means all life in general, 
but in a strict sense it was the life in people who had been regenerated Here therefore the final descendants of the Most Ancient Church are meant. They are here called 'the spirit of life<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>' or, as 
in Chapter 7:22 below, 'in whose nostrils is the breath of the spirit of life<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>' because although no life of faith remained with them they nevertheless derived from their forefathers something of that 
Church's seed, which they stifled. 'Flesh under the heavens' means that which is merely bodily, 'the heavens' being things constituting man's understanding of truth and his will for good. When these 
have been separated from what is bodily, a person can stay alive no longer. That which sustains him is his conjunction with heaven, that is, with the Lord by way of heaven.

'Ad perdendum omnem carnem in qua spiritus vitarum, sub caelis': quod significet quod se perderet omnis posteritas Ecclesiae Antiquissimae, constat inde, tum ex eorum descriptione prius, quod successive 
hereditario traxerint a parentibus talem genium ut tam diris persuasionibus prae aliis imbuerentur; imprimis ex causa quod doctrinalia fidei, quae apud se habebant, cupiditatibus suis infuderint, 
tunc tales facti; aliter se res habuit cum iis qui nulla doctrinalia fidei habent, sed in ignorantia prorsus vivunt; ii non possunt ita facere, ita non profanare sancta, et sic intercludere viam pro reliquiis, 
[2] consequenter non angelos Domini a se expellere.  Reliquiae, ut dictum, sunt omnia innocentiae, omnia charitatis, omnia misericordiae, et omnia veritatis fidei, quae homo ab infantia a Domino 
habuit, et didicit; omnia et singula illa reconduntur; quae si homo non haberet, nusquam aliquid innocentiae, charitatis et misericordiae potuisset inesse ejus cogitationi et actionibus, proinde 
nihil boni et veri; inde pejor foret immanibus feris; similiter si haberet reliquias talium, at per foedas cupiditates et diras persuasiones falsi viam obturaret ne operari possent; tales fuerunt antediluviani 
qui semet perdiderunt, qui intelliguntur per 'omnem carnem in qua spiritus vitarum, sub caelis.'  [3] 'Caro' significat, ut prius ostensum, omnem hominem in genere, et corporeum in specie; 'spiritus 
vitarum' omnem vitam in genere, sed proprie illorum vitam qui regenerati fuerunt, ita hic posteritatem ultimam Ecclesiae Antiquissimae, in qua tametsi nulla vita fidei residua; usque quia a parentibus 
traxerunt aliquid seminis inde quod suffocarunt, hic vocatur 'spiritus vitarum,' seu 'in cujus naribus flatus spiritus vitarum,' ut cap. seq. vii vers. 22. 'Caro sub caelis' significat mere 
corporeum, 'caeli' sunt intellectualia veri et voluntaria boni; quae cum a corporeo separata sunt, homo non amplius potest vivere; quod sustinet hominem, est conjunctio ejus cum caelo, hoc est, per caelum 
cum Domino. </p>
