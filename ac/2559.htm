<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2559节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2559.</strong>“当神叫我离开父家的时候”表当祂离开记忆知识和由此产生的表象，连同此处“父家”所表示的其快乐的时候。这从“离开”和“家”的含义清楚可知：“离开”是指抛下；“家”是指良善（<a href="2231.htm">2231</a>，<a href="2233.htm">2233</a>节），此处的良善在于从记忆知识和理性事物的表象所接受的快乐，因为一切快乐皆看似良善。“父家”在此表示从记忆知识和理性事物，因而从它们的表象所接受的快乐，是因为它们论及离开父家时的亚伯拉罕，因为那个时候，亚伯拉罕及其父家都拜别神（参看<a href="1356.htm">1356</a>，<a href="1992.htm">1992</a>节）。正因如此，经上才以复数形式说“神（神明）叫我离开”。这句话的原文是这样表述的：“神明（gods）叫我漂流在外”，但由于亚伯拉罕代表主，故这句话必须表述为“神叫我离开”。正因主最初所具有的记忆知识和源于它们的理性事物都是人的，充满来自母亲之物，因而并非纯粹的神性，所以它们由亚伯拉罕的第一个状态来代表。至于代表到什么程度，可参看前文（<a href="665.htm">665</a>，<a href="1907.htm">1907</a>末尾，<a href="1361.htm">1361</a>，<a href="1992.htm">1992</a>节）。</p>

And it came to pass when God caused me to depart from my father's house. That this signifies when He left what is of memory-knowledge, and the appearances therefrom, together with their delights, which 
here are the "house of his father," is evident from the signification of "departing," as being to leave; and from the signification of "house," as being good (n. 2231, 2233), here the good of the delight 
from the appearances of the things of memory-knowledge and of rational things; for all delight appears as good. That by the "house of his father" are here signified the delights of memory-knowledges 
and of rational things, consequently of their appearances, comes from the fact that they are predicated of Abraham when he departed from the house of his father; for then Abraham together with the 
house of his father worshiped other gods (see n. 1356, 1992). Hence it is that it is said in the plural, "God [Elohim] caused me to depart." It might also be rendered according to the original tongue, 
"the gods caused me to wander;" but as the Lord is represented by Abraham it must be rendered "God caused me to depart." As with the Lord the first memory-knowledges and the rational things derived 
from them were human, being imbued with what was hereditary from the mother, and thus were not purely Divine, they are therefore represented by Abraham's first state (but how far representations go, 
see n. 665, 1907e, 1361, 1992). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2559</b></p><p><b>2559.</b>
'It happened, when God caused me to depart from my father's house' means when He left behind factual knowledge and the appearances that arise from this, together with their delights, meant here by 'father's 
house'. This is clear from the meaning of 'departing' as leaving behind, and from the meaning of 'house' as good, <a href="2233.htm">2233</a>, here the good that consists in the delight received from the appearances 
that go with factual knowledge and rational concepts, for all delight appears as good. The reason 'father's house' here means the delights received from factual knowledge and rational concepts, and therefore 
from the appearances that go with these, is that they are spoken of in reference to Abraham when he departed from his father's house, for at that time, together with his father's house, Abraham 
worshipped other gods; see <a href="1356.htm">1356</a>,<a href="1992.htm">1992</a>. This explains why the verb in the clause God caused me to depart is plural. This clause, as is also in keeping with the original language, could be rendered, the 
gods caused me to wander, but because the Lord is represented by Abraham it must be rendered, 'God caused me to depart'. Now it is because the factual knowledge that existed initially with the Lord, 
and also the rational concepts formed from that knowledge, were human - steeped as they were in what had been inherited from the mother - and so were not purely Divine, that they are represented by 
'Abraham's' first state. But how far representations go, see <a href="665.htm">665</a>, <a href="1097.htm">1097</a> (end), <a href="1361.htm">1361</a>, <a href="1992.htm">1992</a>. </p>

`Factum, quando fecerunt discedere me Deus e domo patris mei': quod significet cum relinqueret scientificum et apparentias inde, cum jucundis eorum, quae hic sunt `domus patris,' constat a significatione 
`discedere' quod sit relinquere, et a significatione `domus' quod sit bonum, n. (x)2233, hic bonum jucundi ex scientificorum et rationalium apparentiis, omne enim jucundum apparet ut bonum: quod 
hic per `domum patris' significentur jucunda scientificorum et rationalium, proinde apparentiarum eorum, ex eo venit quia praedicantur de Abrahamo cum `discessit e domo patris sui,' tunc enim Abraham 
cum domo patris sui coluit alios deos, videatur n. 1356, 1992; inde est quod dicatur in plurali, fecerunt discedere me Deus {1} dicendum, quod etiam secundum linguam originalem, fecerunt errare me dii, 
{2} sed quia Dominus repraesentatur per Abrahamum, dicetur {3} fecerunt discedere me deus': quia prima scientifica et inde rationalia apud Dominum fuerunt humana, imbuta hereditario ex matre, ita non 
pure Divina, inde est quod per primum statum Abrahami repraesententur; sed quousque repraesentationes vadunt, videatur n. 665, 1097 fin., 1361, 1992. 	@1 Deus is here, as is usual, the Heb. plural 
`Elohim.'$ 	@2 errare me fecerunt dii.$ 	@3 dicitur.$ </p>
