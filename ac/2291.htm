<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2291节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2291.</strong>我诵主祷文的时候，孩子们稚嫩的理解力的性质也向我显明。这时，他们的领悟流入我的思想观念，这种领悟如此稚嫩，以致他们除了这些话的意思外，几乎什么也不理解。然而，其存在于这种稚嫩理解力中的观念甚至向主开放，也就是说，通过主被打开，因为主尤其从至内层流入小孩子的观念。和成人不同，还没有任何东西关闭他们的观念。他们尚未接受任何阻碍理解真理的虚假原则，也未接受任何阻碍接受良善，从而变得智慧的罪恶生活。</p>

The nature of their tender understanding was also shown me when I was praying the Lord's Prayer; and they then inflowed into the ideas of my thought from their own understanding, which was so tender 
that they understood scarcely anything beyond the sense of the words. Yet their ideas in that tenderness were capable of being opened even to the Lord, that is, even from the Lord, for the Lord inflows 
into the ideas of little children especially, from the inmosts; for nothing has as yet closed their ideas, as is the case with adults; no principle of falsity against the understanding of truth, and 
no life of evil against the reception of good, and thus not against becoming wise. </p>

The nature of their tender understanding was also shown to me when I have been praying in the words of the Lord's Prayer. At such times they flowed into the ideas comprising my thought from their own 
understanding, which was so tender that they understood scarcely anything more than the meaning of the words. Yet their ideas present in that tender understanding were capable of being opened even to 
the Lord, that is, even from the Lord; for the Lord flows in best of all into young children's ideas, from things that are inmost, since nothing as yet has closed their ideas, as is the case with adults. 
No false assumptions have been adopted to prevent an understanding of truth, nor a life of evil to prevent the reception of good, and so to becoming wise. </p>

</p><b>2291.</b>
Qualis illorum tener intellectus sit, etiam ostensum mihi cum ego Orationem Domini orarem, et illi tunc in ideas cogitationis meae ex suo intellectuali influerent, quod tam tenerum fuit ut vix illis 
aliquid praeter sensum verborum; sed usque quod ideae eorum in illa teneritudine essent apertiles usque ad Dominum, hoc est, usque a Domino; nam Dominus in infantum ideas praeprimis ab intimis influit; 
nihil enim adhuc illorum ideas clausit sicut apud adultos, nulla principia falsi ad intelligendum verum, nec vita mali ad recipiendum bonum, et sic ad sapiendum. </p>
