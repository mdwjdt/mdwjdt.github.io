<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4563节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4563.</strong>“利百加的奶母底波拉死了”表遗传的邪恶被逐出。这从“死”的含义和“底波拉”的代表清楚可知：“死”是指结束，或不再是原样的某种事物（参看<a href="494.htm">494</a>，<a href="3253.htm">3253</a>，<a href="3259.htm">3259</a>，<a href="3276.htm">3276</a>节），因而在此是指被逐出，因为所论述的主题是遗传的邪恶；“底波拉”，就是利百加的奶母，是指遗传的邪恶。严格来说，“奶母或乳母”因哺育和乳养婴儿，故表示纯真藉由属天-属灵之物的注入，因为“奶或乳”表示属天-属灵之物（<a href="2184.htm">2184</a>节），她所乳养的婴儿表示纯真（<a href="430.htm">430</a>，<a href="1616.htm">1616</a>，<a href="2126.htm">2126</a>，<a href="2305.htm">2305</a>，<a href="2306.htm">2306</a>节）。但此处“利百加的奶母底波拉”表示从母亲得来并自婴儿时就被养育之物。这就是主与之争战的来自母亲的遗传邪恶，这一点从关于这种遗传的说明（<a href="1414.htm">1414</a>，<a href="1444.htm">1444</a>，<a href="1573.htm">1573</a>节），以及祂逐出这遗传，以致最后祂不是马利亚的儿子可以看出来（参看<a href="2159.htm">2159</a>，<a href="2574.htm">2574</a>，<a href="2649.htm">2649</a>，<a href="3036.htm">3036</a>节）。<br />众所周知，人从其父母那里得来邪恶，这种邪恶被称为遗传的邪恶。因此，他生来就进入其中，但这恶一直未显明自己，直到此人成年，出于自己的理解和基于理解的意愿行事。在此期间，尤其在童年早期，它隐藏起来。由于主的怜悯，没有人因遗传的邪恶受指责，只为自己所行的实际邪恶负责任（<a href="966.htm">966</a>，<a href="2308.htm">2308</a>节）；并且在此人出于自己的理解和自己的意愿行事之前，遗传的邪恶不可能变成他所行的邪恶，所以主藉由来自祂的小孩子和天使来引导小孩子。正因如此，他们看似处于纯真的状态，然而，遗传的邪恶仍潜藏在他们所行的一切事里面（<a href="2300.htm">2300</a>，<a href="2307.htm">2307</a>，<a href="2308.htm">2308</a>节）。这遗传的邪恶甚至给他们提供滋养，也就是表现得像个乳母或保姆，直到他们到了自主判断的年龄（<a href="4063.htm">4063</a>节）。这时，他们若正在重生，就会被主引入一个新婴儿期的状态，最后被引入天上的智慧，进而被引入纯正的婴儿期，也就是纯真；因为纯正的婴儿期或纯真居于智慧之中（<a href="2305.htm">2305</a>，<a href="3183.htm">3183</a>节）。不同之处在于，婴儿期的纯真在外，遗传邪恶在内；而智慧的纯真在内，邪恶，无论实际的还是遗传的，则在外。从这些事，和前面提到的其它许多事明显可知，从婴儿初期到新婴儿期的年龄，遗传的邪恶一直表现得像个乳母或保姆。这解释了为何“奶母”（或乳母）表示遗传的邪恶，还表示纯真藉由属天-属灵之物的注入。<br />由于就本章的内义而言，所论述的主题是良善在主的属世层里面对真理的排列或排序，和由此而来的朝内层事物发展（<a href="4536.htm">4536</a>节），故遗传邪恶的逐出也被论述。这就是为何本节提及利百加的奶母底波拉，并且她被葬在伯特利下边橡树底下的原因，这些细节若不包含此类事物，就太过微不足道，不足以打断此处所描述事件的顺序。<br />“利百加的奶母”具体所指的真正奥秘还不能透露，因为在此之前，人必须首先了解理性层进入属世层的流注的性质，也就是说，它是一种从理性层的良善直接进入属世层的良善的流注，以及从理性层的良善经由那里的真理间接进入属世真理的流注。“利百加”是指理性层的真理（<a href="3012.htm">3012</a>，<a href="3013.htm">3013</a>，<a href="3077.htm">3077</a>节）；“以撒”是指理性层的良善（<a href="3012.htm">3012</a>，<a href="3194.htm">3194</a>，<a href="3210.htm">3210</a>节）；“以扫”是指由来自“以撒”所表示的理性层良善的直接流注所产生的属世层良善；“雅各”是指良善，也就是由通过“利百加”所表示的理性层真理而来的间接流注所产生的属世层真理之良善。关于这种间接流注和直接流注，可参看前文（<a href="3314.htm">3314</a>，<a href="3573.htm">3573</a>节）。人必须首先了解这一切，才能对这个奥秘获得某种具体知识，也就是为何“利百加的奶母”在此表示并描述遗传的邪恶。正是凭着关于流注的这种知识，人才能看清遗传邪恶的性质。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4563</b></p><p><b>4563.</b>
And Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died. That this signifies that hereditary evil was expelled, is evident from the signification of "dying," as being the end, or that a thing ceases to be such (see n. 494, 
3253, 3259, 3276), here therefore expelled, because the subject treated of is hereditary evil; and from the representation of Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, as being hereditary evil. In nourishing and suckling 
an infant a nurse properly signifies the insinuation of innocence by means of what is celestial spiritual, for milk denotes the celestial spiritual (n. 2184), and the infant she suckles denotes 
innocence (n. 430, 1616, 2126, 2305, 2306) But here by "Deborah, Rebekah's nurse," is signified that which was received from the mother and nourished from infancy. That this was the hereditary evil 
from the mother against which the Lord fought, may be seen from what has been shown regarding this hereditary (n. 1414, 1444, 1573), and from His expelling it, so that at last He was not the son of Mary 
(see n. 2159, 2574, 2649, 3036). [2] It is known that man derives evil from both his parents, and that this evil is called hereditary evil. He is therefore born into it, but still it does not manifest 
itself until the man becomes an adult and acts from his understanding and the derivative will, and meanwhile it lies hidden, especially during infancy. And as of the Lord's mercy no one is blamed 
for what is hereditary, but for what is actual (n. 966, 2308), and what is hereditary cannot become actual until the man acts from his own understanding and his own will, therefore infants are led by 
the Lord by means of infants and angels from Him, and hence they appear in a state of innocence while hereditary evil still lurks in everything they do (n. 2300, 2307, 2308). This hereditary evil yields 
them nourishment, or is as a nurse, until the time when they judge for themselves (n. 4063); and then if they are being regenerated they are brought by the Lord into a state of new infancy, and at 
last into heavenly wisdom; thus into genuine infancy, that is, into innocence; for genuine infancy or innocence dwells in wisdom (n. 2305, 3183). The difference is, that the innocence of infancy is without, 
and hereditary evil within; whereas the innocence of wisdom is within, and evil both actual and hereditary is without. From these and other things that have been already stated, it is evident 
that hereditary evil acts as a nurse from the earliest infancy to the age of new infancy; and hence it is that by a "nurse" is signified hereditary evil, and also that by a "nurse" is signified the insinuation 
of innocence by means of the celestial spiritual.  [3] As in the internal sense of this chapter the disposition and arrangement of truths by good in the Lord's natural is treated of (n. 4536), 
and the consequent progression to interior things, therefore hereditary evil is also treated of, in that it was expelled. This is the reason why mention is made in this verse of Deborah, Rebekah's 
nurse, that she died and was buried under an oak, which is not a thing of sufficient moment to interrupt the series unless it involved such things. [4] The very mystery that is specifically signified 
by "Rebekah's nurse" cannot as yet be disclosed, for before this is done it is necessary to know the nature of the influx of the rational into the natural, namely, that it is from the good of the rational 
immediately into the good of the natural, and from the good of the rational mediately, through the truth there into the good of natural truth. "Rebekah" is the truth of the rational (n. 3012, 3013, 
3077); and "Isaac" is the good of the rational (n. 3012, 3194, 3210); "Esau" is the good of the natural by immediate influx from the good of the rational, or "Isaac;" and "Jacob" is the good or good 
of truth of the natural by mediate influx through the truth of the rational, or "Rebekah." (In regard to this influx, mediate and immediate, see above, n. 3314, 3573.) This must be known before it 
is possible to have any specific knowledge of the mystery why by "Rebekah's nurse" is here signified and described hereditary evil; for it is from this that the nature of this evil can be seen. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4563</b></p><p><b>4563.</b>
'Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died' means that hereditary evil was cast out. This is clear from the meaning of 'dying' as the end or something ceasing to be such as it has been, dealt with in <a href="494.htm">494</a>, <a href="3253.htm">3253</a>, <a href="3259.htm">3259</a>, <a href="3276.htm">3276</a>, and here therefore, since the subject is hereditary evil, that this was cast out; and from the representation of 'Deborah, who was Rebekah's nurse' as hereditary evil. Inasmuch as she nourishes 
and suckles an infant, 'a nurse' strictly speaking means the instilling of innocence by means of what is celestial-spiritual, for 'milk' means that which is celestial-spiritual, <a href="2184.htm">2184</a>, and the infant 
whom she suckles means innocence, <a href="430.htm">430</a>,<a href="1616.htm">1616</a>, <a href="2126.htm">2126</a>, <a href="2305.htm">2305</a>, <a href="2306.htm">2306</a>. But in this verse 'Deborah, Rebekah's nurse' means that which was received from the mother and nourished from infancy. This was the 
hereditary evil from the mother which the Lord fought against, as may be seen from what has been shown regarding that heredity, <a href="1414.htm">1414</a>, <a href="1444.htm">1444</a>, <a href="1573.htm">1573</a>, which heredity He cast out, so that at length He was not 
Mary's son, <a href="2159.htm">2159</a>, <a href="2574.htm">2574</a>, <a href="2649.htm">2649</a>, <a href="3036.htm">3036</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It is well known that a person derives evil from both parents and that this evil is called hereditary evil. He is therefore born with that evil, but it does 
not show itself until he grows up and acts from his understanding and his will based on his understanding. In the meantime it lies hidden, especially during early childhood. Now because in the Lord's 
mercy no one can come to be blamed for his hereditary evil, only for the evil of his own doing, <a href="966.htm">966</a>, <a href="2308.htm">2308</a>, and hereditary evil cannot become evil of his own doing until he acts from his own understanding 
and his own will, young children are therefore guided by the Lord by means of young children and angels. It is for this reason that they are seen to live in a state of innocence; yet hereditary 
evil lies hidden within each particular thing they do, <a href="2300.htm">2300</a>, <a href="2307.htm">2307</a>, <a href="2308.htm">2308</a>. This hereditary evil even provides them with nourishment, that is, it acts like a nurse until they reach the age of discretion, 
<a href="4063.htm">4063</a>. Then, if they are being regenerated, they are brought by the Lord into the state of a new infancy, and at length into heavenly wisdom, and so into genuine infancy, which innocence is; for genuine 
infancy, or innocence, dwells within wisdom, <a href="2305.htm">2305</a>, <a href="3183.htm">3183</a>. The difference is that the innocence of infancy is present outwardly and hereditary evil inwardly, whereas the innocence of wisdom is present 
inwardly and evil - hereditary and that of the person's own doing - outwardly. From these considerations, and many others mentioned previously, it is evident that hereditary evil serves so to speak 
as nourishment from earliest infancy to the age of the new infancy. This explains why 'a nurse' means hereditary evil, as well as meaning the instillation of innocence by means of that which is celestial-spiritual. </p>

<p><b>[3]</b>
Since the arrangement or ordering of truths by good within the Lord's Natural, and consequently the progression towards aspects more interior, <a href="4536.htm">4536</a>, is the subject in the internal 
sense of this chapter therefore the casting out of hereditary evil is dealt with too. This is the reason why in this verse the death of Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, and her burial under an oak tree are 
recorded, which are matters that would be too unimportant to interrupt the sequence of events described here if they did not embody the kind of the things that have been mentioned. </p>

<p><b>[4]</b>
 The actual 
arcanum meant specifically by Rebekah's nurse cannot as yet be disclosed. One must first know about the nature of the influx of the rational into the natural, which is an influx from the good of the 
rational directly into the good of the natural, and an influx from the good of the rational indirectly by way of the truth there into the good of natural truth. 'Rebekah' is the truth of the rational, 
<a href="3012.htm">3012</a>, <a href="3013.htm">3013</a>, <a href="3077.htm">3077</a>, whereas 'Isaac' is the good of the rational, <a href="3012.htm">3012</a>, <a href="3194.htm">3194</a>, <a href="3210.htm">3210</a>. 'Esau' is the good of the natural resulting from direct influx from the good of the rational, meant by 'Isaac', and 'Jacob' 
is the good - that is, the good of natural truth - resulting from an indirect influx through the truth of the rational, meant by 'Rebekah'. Regarding this indirect and direct influx see <a href="3314.htm">3314</a>, <a href="3573.htm">3573</a>. 
This must be known first before anyone can have specific knowledge of the arcanum why 'Rebekah's nurse' means and describes hereditary evil here. It is from such knowledge about influx that one is 
able to see the nature of that hereditary evil. </p>

`Moriebatur Deborah nutrix Rebeccae': quod significet malum hereditarium quod expulsum, constat ex significatione `meri' quod sit finis seu quod tale esse desinat, de qua n. 494, 3253, 3259, 3276,

illo, n. 1414, 1444, (x)1573 ostensa sunt; et quod id expulerit ut tandem non esset illius Mariae, n. 2159, 2574, 2649, 3036. [2] Notum est quod homo ab utroque parente malum trahat, et
