<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7896节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7896.</strong>出埃及记12:17-20.你们要守无酵饼的节，因为我正当这日把你们的军队从埃及地领出来；所以你们要世世代代守这日，作为永远的定例。从正月十四日，你们晚上要吃无酵饼，直到本月二十一日晚上。在你们各家中，七日之内不可有酵，因为凡吃有酵之物的，无论是寄居的，是本地的，灵魂必从以色列的会众中剪除。有酵的物，你们都不可吃，在你们一切住处要吃无酵饼。<br />“你们要守无酵饼的节”表必没有虚假。“因为我正当这日把你们的军队从埃及地领出来”表因为那时是仁与信的状态，在这种状态下，与那些沉浸于邪恶和虚假之人的分离会发生。“所以你们要世世代代守这日，作为永远的定例”表符合神性秩序的源于信与仁的敬拜。“从正月十四日”表在一种神圣状态的开始。“晚上”表先前状态的结束和新状态的开始。“你们要吃无酵饼”表良善对从虚假中洁净的真理的吸收。“直到本月二十一日”表这种神圣状态的结束。“晚上”表先前状态的结束和新状态的开始。“七日之内”表该状态的整个时期。“在你们各家中，不可有酵”表任何虚假都不可接近良善。“因为凡吃有酵之物的，灵魂必从以色列的会众中剪除”表凡将虚假与自己的良善相联结的，都将受到诅咒。“无论是寄居的，是本地的”表凡属于教会的，无论他是否出生在教会之内。“有酵的物，你们都不可吃”表要高度警惕、极其小心地防止把虚假变成自己的。“在你们一切住处要吃无酵饼”表在他们的内层，凡良善所在之处，真理必变成他们自己的。</p>

Verses 17-20. And ye shall observe the unleavened things, because in this same day I have brought your armies out of the land of Egypt; and ye shall keep this day in your generations by an eternal statute. 
In the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, ye shall eat unleavened things, until the one and twentieth day of the month, in the evening. Seven days leaven shall not 
be found in your houses; for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the assemblage of Israel, in the sojourner, and in the native of the land. Ye shall eat nothing 
leavened; in all your dwellings ye shall eat things unleavened. "And ye shall observe the unleavened things," signifies that there must be no falsity; "because in this same day I have brought your 
armies out of the land of Egypt," signifies because then there is a state of charity and faith, through which there is separation from those who are in evils and falsities; "and ye shall keep this 
day in your generations by an eternal statute," signifies worship from faith and charity according to the order of heaven; "in the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month," signifies in the 
beginning of a holy state; "in the evening," signifies the end of the former state and the beginning of a new one; "ye shall eat things unleavened," signifies the appropriation by good, of truth purified 
from falsity; "until the one and twentieth day of the month," signifies the end of this holy state; "in the evening," signifies the end of the former state and the beginning of a new one; "seven days," 
signifies the entire period of this state; "leaven shall not be found in your houses," signifies that nothing whatever of falsity shall come near good; "for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, 
even that soul shall be cut off from the assemblage of Israel," signifies that he who adjoins falsity to his good is damned; "in the sojourner and in the native of the land," signifies who is of the 
church, whether not born in it, or born in it; "ye shall eat nothing leavened," signifies that every caution is to be used to prevent falsity from being appropriated; "in all your dwellings ye shall 
eat things unleavened," signifies that in the interiors, where good is, truth shall be appropriated. </p>

Verses 17-20 And you shall observe [the feast of] unleavened bread, for on this same day I have brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt; and you shall keep this day throughout your generations by 
an eternal statute. In the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening you shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty-first day of the month in the evening. For seven days no yeast 
shall be found in your houses; for anyone eating anything made with yeast, that soul shall be cut off from the assembly of Israel, whether a sojourner or a native of the land. You shall eat nothing 
made with yeast; in all your dwellings you shall eat unleavened bread. </p>
<p>'And you shall observe [the feast of] unleavened bread' means that there must be no falsity. 'For on this same day I have brought 
your hosts out of the land of Egypt' means because that time is a state of charity and faith, during which separation from those steeped in evils and falsities takes place. 'And you shall keep 
this day throughout your generations by an eternal statute' means worship that springs from faith and charity in keeping with Divine order. 'In the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month' means 
at the beginning of a holy state. 'In the evening' means the end of the previous state and the beginning of the new one. 'You shall eat unleavened bread' means the assimilation by good of truth purified 
from falsity. 'Until the twenty-first day of the month' means the end of that holy state. 'In the evening' means the end of the previous state and the beginning of the new one. 'For seven days' 
means the whole period of this state. 'No yeast shall be found in your houses means no falsity whatever shall come near good. 'For anyone eating anything made with yeast, that soul shall be cut off 
from the assembly of Israel' means that whoever links falsity to his good is damned. 'Whether a sojourner or a native of the land' means someone belonging to the Church, whether he was not born in it 
or was born in it. 'You shall eat nothing made with yeast' means being fully on their guard against making falsity their own. 'In all your dwellings you shall eat unleavened bread' means that in their 
interiors, where good is, truth must be made their own.  </p>

(x)  Vers. 17-20.  Et observabitis azyma, quia [in] eodem die hoc eduxi exercitus vestros e terra Aegypti, et custodietis diem hunc generationibus vestris statuto aeterno.  In primo, in quartodecimo die 
mensis in vespera comedetis azyma, usque ad diem primum et vicesimum mensis in vespera.  Septem diebus fermentum non invenietur in domibus vestris, quia omnis comedens fermentatum, et exscindetur anima 
illa e coetu Israelis, in peregrino et in indigena terrae.  Nullum fermentatum comedetis, in omnibus habitationibus vestris comedetis azyma.  `Et observabitis azyma' significat quod nullum falsum 
erit: `quia in eodem die hoc eduxi exercitus vestros e terra Aegypti' significat quia status tunc charitatis et fidei, per quem separatio ab illis qui in malis et falsis: `et custodietis diem hunc generationibus 
vestris statuto aeterno' significat cultum ex fide et charitate secundum ordinem {1}Divinum: `in primo, in quartodecimo die mensis' significat in principio sancti status: `in vespera' significat 
finem status prioris et principium novi: `comedetis azyma' significat appropriationem veri a bono purificati a falso: `usque ad diem primum et vicesimum mensis' significat finem status illius 
sancti: `in vespera' significat finem status prioris et principium novi: `septem diebus' significat integram periodum hujus status: `fermentum non invenietur in domibus vestris' significat quod prorsus 
nihil falsi accedet ad bonum: `quia omnis comedens fermentatum, et exscindetur anima illa e coetu Israelis' significat quod qui bono suo adjungit falsum damnatus sit: `in peregrino et in indigena terrae' 
significat qui ab Ecclesia, sive non natus ibi, sive natus ibi: `nullum fermentatum comedetis' significat quod cavendum omnino ne approprietur falsum: `in omnibus habitationibus vestris comedetis 
azyma' significat quod in interioribus ubi bonum, appropriabitur verum. 	@1 coeli I$ </p>
