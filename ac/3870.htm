<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3870节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3870.</strong>“我被恨”表若意愿不与它对应的信之状态。这从“被恨”的含义清楚可知，“被恨”是指不被爱，因为这就是若意愿不与它对应的信之状态。就内在意义而言，所论述的主题是人的重生从外在到内在，也就是从信之真理到仁之良善的发展。信之真理是外在的，仁之良善是内在的。为了信之真理可以存活，它必须被引入意愿，以便它能在那里接受生命。因为从知道所发出的真理不是活的，只有从意愿发出的真理才是活的。生命通过主在人里面所造的新意愿而从主流入。首先到来的生命表现为顺从，这是意愿的最初层级。其次到来的是生命表现为对践行真理的情感，这是意愿的发展层级，当在践行真理的过程中感觉到快乐和幸福时，意愿的发展层级就到来了。除非信以这种方式发展，否则，真理不会成为真理，而是成了脱离生活的事，有时变成对虚假的确证，有时变成说服式的信仰，因而成为肮脏的事。因为它与人的邪恶情感或欲望，也就是人自己的意愿和仁爱的反面苟合。这就是当今许多人以之为正信的信仰，他们以为这信凭自身而无需仁爱的行为就能拯救人。<br />不过，这信，也就是脱离仁爱，因而违背仁爱的信，在下文由与其父亲的妾辟拉同寝的流便来代表（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创35.22.htm">35:22</a>）。对此，雅各，那时名叫以色列，以下面这些话表达自己的憎恶。<br />流便哪，我的长子，你是我的力量，是我能力的开始。但你滚沸如水，必不能居首位，因为你上了你父亲的床，污秽了它；他上了我的榻。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.3.htm">49:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.4.htm">4</a>）<br />这信，也就是脱离仁之信所具有的意愿和情感因是仁爱的反面，故在这一章还以下面这些话通过西缅和利未来描述：<br />西缅和利未是弟兄，他们的刀剑是残忍的凶器；我的灵魂啊，不要进入他们的隐密处；我的荣耀哪，不要进入他们的集会联络；因为他们趁怒杀人，任意砍断牛筋。他们的忿怒可咒诅，因为非常暴烈；他们的忿恨可咒诅，因为十分残忍； 我要把他们分散在雅各中，使他们散居在以色列。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.5.htm">49:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.7.htm">7</a>）<br />蒙主的神圣怜悯，此处以“西缅和利未”来描述的脱离仁之信将在下文予以说明。</p>

That I was hated. That this signifies a state of faith if the will be not correspondent thereto, is evident from the signification of "being hated," as being not loved, for such is the state of faith 
if the will does not correspond to it. In the internal sense the subject treated of is the progress of man's regeneration from external to internal; that is, from the truth of faith to the good of charity. 
The truth of faith is external, and the good of charity is internal. In order that the truth of faith may live, it must be introduced into the will, that it may there receive life; for truth does 
not live from knowing, but from willing. Life flows in from the Lord through the new willing that He creates in man. The first life manifests itself by obedience, which is the first of the will; the 
second by the affection of doing the truth, which is the progression of the will, and which exists when delight and bliss are perceived in doing the truth. Unless there takes place such a progress of 
faith, truth does not become truth, but becomes a separate affair from life, sometimes confirmative of falsity, and sometimes persuasive of it, thus a foul affair; for it couples itself with the man's 
evil affection, or cupidity; that is, with his own proper will, which is contrary to charity. Such is the faith that by many at this day is believed to be faith, and to save without the works of charity. [2] 
But this faith, which is separate from charity, and therefore contrary to charity, is represented in what follows by Reuben, in that he lay with Bilhah his father's concubine (Gen. 35:22), 
and concerning which Jacob, then Israel, expresses his detestation in the words: </p>
<p>     Reuben, my firstborn, thou art my might, and the beginning of my strength; light as water thou shalt not excel, 
because thou wentest up on thy father's bed, then defiledst thou it; he went up on my couch (Gen. 49:3-4). The will and affection of this faith, namely, that which is separated from charity, as being 
contrary to charity, is also described in the same chapter by Simeon and Levi in these words: </p>
<p>     Simeon and Levi are brethren; weapons of violence are their swords; let not my soul come into their 
secret; into their assembly let not my glory unite itself; for in their fury they slew a man, and in their will they unstrung an ox. Cursed be their fury, for it was fierce; and their anger, for it was 
cruel; I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel (Gen. 49:5-7). That it is faith separate from charity which is here described by "Simeon and Levi," will of the Lord's Divine mercy be 
shown in what follows. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3870</b></p><p><b>3870.</b>
'That I was hated' means the state of faith if there is no will corresponding to it. This is clear from the meaning of 'hated' as not loved, for this is the state of faith if the will does not correspond 
to it. The subject in the internal sense is the advance of a person's regeneration from what is external to what is internal, that is, from the truth of faith towards the good of charity. Truth which 
is the truth of faith is external, and good which is the good of charity is internal. So that it may be living, truth which is the truth of faith must be introduced into the will so as to receive 
life there. For truth which issues from knowledge is not living, only truth which issues from the will. Through the new will which the Lord creates in man life flows in from Him. The life which comes 
first manifests itself in obedience, this being the first degree of the will. The life which comes second manifests itself in the affection for doing what is true, this being a more advanced degree of 
the will, which is arrived at when delight and blessing are felt in the doing of what is true. Unless faith advances in this way truth does not become truth but something separated from life. Sometimes 
it becomes the corroboration of falsity, sometimes persuasive belief, and so something debased, for it couples itself to man's evil affection or desire, that is, to the will that is properly his own 
and the reverse of charity. Such is the faith which is believed to be true faith by many at the present day; they believe that this faith is able - of itself, without the works of charity - to save 
a person. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But this faith - that is to say, faith separated from charity and therefore contrary to charity - is represented later on by Reuben's lying with Bilhah his father's concubine, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2035:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 35:22</a>, 
and by the expression of disgust by Jacob, who by then was named Israel, in the following words, </p>
<p>Reuben, my firstborn, you are my strength and the beginning of my power. Unstable as water, may 
you not excel, for you went up to your father's bed; then you defiled it. He went up to my couch. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2049:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 49:3, 4</a>. </p>
<p>Also described in that chapter, by means of Simeon and Levi, is the contrariety to 
charity of the will and affection that go with this faith, namely faith separated from charity, in the following words, </p>
<blockquote>
Simeon and Levi are brothers; weapons of violence are their swords. Into their 
secret place let my soul not come; in their assembly let not my glory be united; for in their fury they killed a man, and in their wilfulness they hamstrung an ox. Cursed be their fury, for it is fierce, 
and their anger, for it is severe. I will divide them in Jacob, and will scatter them in Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2049:5-7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 49:5-7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>That faith separated from charity is described in this case by Simeon and Levi will 
in the Lord's Divine mercy be shown later on. </p>

`Quod exosa ego': quod significet statum fidei si non voluntas ei correspondens, constat ex significatione `exosae' quod sit non amata, talis enim est status fidei, si non voluntas ei correspondet. 
 {1} Agitur in sensu interno de progressu regenerationis hominis ab externo ad internum, hoc est, a vero fidei ad bonum charitatis; verum quod fidei, est externum, et bonum quod charitatis, est 
internum; ut verum quod est fidei, vivat {2}, inducetur ad voluntatem ut ibi vitam accipiat, verum enim ex scire non vivit, sed ex velle; per novum velle, quod Dominus creat apud hominem, influit vita 
ab Ipso; prima vita se manifestat per oboedientiam, quae est primum voluntatis; altera per affectionem faciendi verum, quae est progressivum voluntatis, {3} quae tunc est quando jucundum et beatum 
in faciendo verum percipitur; nisi fidei progressus talis fiat, verum non {4} fit verum, sed fit quoddam separatum a vita, quandoque confirmativum falsi, et quandoque persuasivum, ita quoddam spurcum, 
nam se copulat cum affectioni mala hominis seu ejus cupiditate, hoc est, cum voluntate propria ejus quae contraria charitati est; talis est fides quae a multis hodie creditur esse fides, et 
sola absque charitatis operibus salvare; [2] sed haec fides nempe separata a charitate, et inde contraria charitati, repraesentatur in sequentibus per `Reubenem, quod cubuerit cum Bilha concubina 
patris sui,' Gen. xxxv 22, et quam detestatur Jacob, tunc Israel, hi verbis,      Reuben, primogenitus meus, tu robur meum, et principium      virtutis meae,... levis es sicut aqua {5}, ne excellas, 
quia      ascendisti cubilia patris tui, tunc polluisti {6}, stratum      meum ascendit, Gen. xlix 3, 4; </p>
<p>hujus fidei nempe separatae a charitate, voluntas et affectio contraria charitati, describitur 
ibi quoque per Shimeonem et Levi, his verbis,      Shimeon et Levi fratres, arma violentiae machaerae eorum, in      arcanum eorum non veniat anima mea, in coetu eorum ne uniat se      gloria 
mea, quia in furore suo occiderunt virum, et in      voluntate sua enervarunt bovem; maledictus furor eorum, quia      vehemens, et ira eorum quia gravis, dividam eos in Jacobum, et      dispergam 
eos in Israelem, Gen. xlix 5-7; </p>
<p>quod sit fides separata a charitate, quae per illos describitur, in sequentibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, ostendetur. @1 i Hoc se ita habet$ @2 i fiat verum, 
et$ @3 i ita per charitatem, cf. n. 3876.$ @4 non fit fides, ita nec verum$ @5 aquae$ @6 In 6341 S has prophanasti, and we follow his punctuation in that ref.  Here A and I have no comma after 
polluisti but one after meum$ </p>
