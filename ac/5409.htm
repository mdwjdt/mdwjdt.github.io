<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5409节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5409.</strong>“约瑟的十个哥哥”表诸如教会所知的彼此一致的那类真理。这从“哥哥”的含义清楚可知，“哥哥”是指教会所知的真理。这些真理被称为“约瑟”的哥哥（“约瑟”代表从神性所得来的真理）凭的是他们彼此的一致性；这种一致性使得它们如同兄弟与兄弟那般联结在一起。“雅各的儿子”表示一切信之真理，或作为一个总整体的教会真理（参看<a href="5403.htm">5403</a>节）；“约瑟的哥哥”具有相同的含义，只是这是由于他们彼此的一致性。雅各与利亚所生的十个儿子表示外在教会的真理，雅各与拉结所生的两个儿子表示内在教会的真理，这从前面关于利亚和拉结的说明清楚看出来；“利亚”是指对外层真理的情感，“拉结”是指对内层真理的情感（<a href="3758.htm">3758</a>，<a href="3782.htm">3782</a>，<a href="3793.htm">3793</a>，<a href="3819.htm">3819</a>节）。内在教会与外在教会，或说教会的内在与外在是“弟兄”（参看<a href="1222.htm">1222</a>节）。因此，主自己用“弟兄”一词来描述凭着仁与信而彼此一致存在的衍生真理与良善，也就是用来描述那些知道真理，并出于这些真理渴望良善的人。如马太福音：<br />王必回答他们说，我实在告诉你们，这些事你们既做在我这弟兄中一个最小的身上，就是做在我身上了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.40.htm">25:40</a>）<br />别处：<br />耶稣回答他们说，谁是我的母亲？谁是我的弟兄？就四面观看那周围坐着的人，说，看哪！我的母亲，我的弟兄！凡遵行神旨意的人，就是我的弟兄姐妹和母亲了。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可3.33.htm">3:33</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可3.35.htm">35</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.49.htm">12:49</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.21.htm">8:21</a>）</p>

Joseph's ten brethren. That this signifies such truths of the church as corresponded, is evident from the signification of "brethren," as being the truths which are of the church. It is from the correspondence 
that these are called the "brethren" of Joseph, who is truth from the Divine; for the correspondence causes them to be conjoined as brother with brother. By the "sons of Jacob" are signified 
all things of faith, or the truths of the church in general (see n. 5403); and the same are signified by "Joseph's brethren," but from the correspondence. By the ten sons of Jacob by Leah are signified 
the truths of the external church, and by the two sons of Jacob by Rachel are signified the truths of the internal church, as is plain from what has been shown concerning Leah and Rachel, that "Leah" 
is the affection of exterior truth, and "Rachel" the affection of interior truth (n. 3758, 3782, 3793, 3819). That the internal and the external of the church are "brothers," may be seen above (n. 
1222). The Lord Himself calls "brethren" the derivative truths and goods in correspondence through charity and faith, that is, those who are in truths and the derivative good; as in Matthew: </p>
<p>	The King 
shall say unto them, Verily I say unto you, insofar as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me (Matt. 25:40). And in another passage: </p>
<p>	Jesus answered them, 
saying, Who is My mother, or My brethren? And looking round about He said, Behold My mother and My brethren! For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is My brother, and My sister, and My 
mother (Mark 3:33-35; Matt. 12:49; Luke 8:21). </p>

'Joseph's ten brothers' means such truths known to the Church as were in agreement with one another. This is clear from the meaning of 'brothers' as truths known to the Church. These truths are called 
'Joseph's brothers' ('Joseph' representing truth received from the Divine) by virtue of their agreement with one another; for that agreement causes them to exist joined together like one brother to 
another. 'The sons of Jacob' means all the truths of faith or the truths as a general whole that are known by the Church, <a href="5403.htm">5403</a>; and the expression 'Joseph's brothers' has a similar meaning, though this 
is because of their agreement with one another. Jacob's ten sons by Leah mean the truths known to the external Church, but Jacob's two sons by Rachel mean the truths known to the internal Church, as 
is evident from what has been shown regarding Leah and Rachel. That is to say, it has been shown that 'Leah' is the affection for exterior truth and 'Rachel' the affection for interior truth, both dealt 
with in <a href="3758.htm">3758</a>, <a href="3782.htm">3782</a>, <a href="3793.htm">3793</a>, <a href="3819.htm">3819</a>. Also, the internal Church and the external Church are 'brothers', see <a href="1221.htm">1221</a>. The Lord Himself therefore uses the word 'brothers' to describe truths and resulting forms 
of good which exist in agreement with one another by virtue of charity and faith, that is, to describe people who know truths and from these desire what is good: In Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
The king will say to 
them, Truly I say to you, Insofar as you did it to one of the least of these My brothers you did it to Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2025:40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 25:40</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus answered them, saying, Who is My mother, or My brothers? 
And looking round about He said, Behold My mother and My brothers! For whoever does the will of God is My brother, and My sister, and My mother. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%203:33-35&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 3:33-35</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2012:49&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 12:49</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%208:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 8:21</a>.

`Fratres Josephi decem': quod significet talia vera Ecclesiae quae corresponderent, constat ex significatione `fratrum' quod sint vera quae Ecclesiae; haec dicuntur `fratres Josephi' qui est verum a 
Divino, ex correspondentia; correspondentia enim facit ut conjuncta sint sicut frater fratri; per (t)filios Jacobi significantur omnia fidei, seu vera Ecclesiae in communi, n. 5403, similiter per `fratres 
Josephi', sed ex correspondentia; (m)per {1}decem filios Jacobi ex Leah significantur vera quae sunt Ecclesiae externae, {2}et per binos filios Jacobi ex Rachel significantur vera quae sunt Ecclesiae 
internae, ut patet ab illis quae de Leah et Rachele ostensa sunt, quod nempe `Leah' sit affectio veri exterioris et `Rachel' affectio veri interioris, de quibus n. 3758, 3782, 3793, 3819;(n) quod 
Ecclesiae internum et externum sint fratres, videatur n. 1222; {3}Ipse Dominus inde vera et inde bona per charitatem et fidem correspondentia vocat `fratres', hoc est, illos qui in veris et inde bono 
sunt{4}; apud Matthaeum, 	Rex dicet illis, Amen dico vobis, in quantum fecistis uni ex  his fratribus meis minimis, Mihi fecistis, xxv 40: </p>
<p>et alibi 	Respondit illis Jesus, dicens, Quae est mater 
Mea, aut fratres  Mei? et circumspiciens circumcirca, . . . dixit, Ecce mater Mea et fratres Mei; {5}quisque namque fecerit voluntatem Dei, hic  frater Meus, et soror Mea, et mater Mea, Marc. iii 33-35, 
Matth. xii 49, Luc. viii 21. @1 the maidservants' children were considered to be children also of the mistress$  @2 at$  @3 Ipse etiam Dominus vocat ipsa vera et inde bona fratres$  @4 i quatenus
