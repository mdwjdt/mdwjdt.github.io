<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5189.</strong>曾有一些灵人来到我面前；只是在他们到来之前，我没有察觉出恶灵发出的气场。这个气场使我以为恶灵正在靠近，而事实上，他们是恶灵的仇敌。我从他们向恶灵所显示出的对抗和敌意的感觉推断他们是恶灵的仇敌。随着他们到来，他们将自己置于我的头上，与我交谈，说他们是人。我回答说，他们不是具有世人所拥有的那种肉体的人；世人习惯因他们的肉体形式而自称人；然而，他们仍是人，因为人的灵才是真正意义上的人。对此，我没有察觉到异议，因为他们支持我所说的。他们继续说，他们是彼此完全不同的人。我觉得由完全不同的人组成的社群在来世不可能存在，于是便与他们讨论这个问题。我说，如果有一个共同的原因使他们成为一个统一的整体，他们就能形成一个社群，因为他们由此都有一个共同的目的。他们接着说，他们的确具有这样的性质，即：每个人说话都与众不同，但他们想的都一样。他们还举例说明了这一点，由此可见所有人的看法都是一样的，只是说法不一样。<br />此后，他们对着我的左耳说话，说他们是善灵，这是他们平常说话的方式。我被告知，这些灵人到场时为数众多；没有人知道他们从哪里来。我发觉恶灵的气场对他们极为敌视，因为恶灵是他们搅动的对象。他们的社群漂泊不定，以一个男人和一个女人在一间屋子里，身穿亮蓝色衣服来代表。<br />我发觉他们与脑峡部有关，脑峡部在大脑与小脑之间，纤维通过它朝各个方向发散，所到之处都以不同的方式在外在部分进行运作。我还发觉，他们与人体内的神经节有关；神经汇入神经节，从那里分成大量纤维；其中有些纤维走这条路，有些走那条路；它们在最外在部分的行为各不相同；然而，它们都有同一个起始点。因此，它们在最外在部分看上去彼此不同；但就目的而言，它们都是一样的。此外，众所周知，作用于四肢的一个力能以各种方式发生变化，这取决于四肢所取的形式。纤维的起始点，如脑中的起始点（纤维就源于它们），也代表目的。从这些起始点引出的纤维代表由这些目的所产生的思维；由这些纤维所构成的神经代表随之产生的行为。</p>

There came some spirits in front; and before their coming I noticed a sphere from evil spirits, from which I supposed that evil spirits were approaching; but they were their enemies, as I learned from 
the aggressive and hostile feeling which they inspired against them. When they arrived they placed themselves above my head, and spoke with me, saying that they were men. I answered that they were not 
men endowed with a body such as men in the world have, who are wont to call themselves men from the form of the body; but that nevertheless they are men, because the spirit of the man is truly the 
man. To this I perceived no dissent, for they confirmed it. They said further that they were men who are unlike; and because it seemed impossible to me that there could be a society in the other life 
of those who are unlike, I talked with them about it, and said that if a common cause impelled them to unity, they nevertheless could be associated, because they would thus all have one end. They said 
that their quality was such that each one speaks differently from the others, and yet they all think alike. This they also illustrated by examples, whereby it appeared that the perception of all was 
one, but that their speech was diverse. [2] They then applied themselves to my left ear and said that they were good spirits, and it was their custom so to speak. It was said of them that they come in 
a body, and that no one knows where they come from. I perceived the sphere of evil spirits to be exceedingly hostile to them; for evil spirits are the subjects whom they agitate. Their society, which 
is a wandering one, was represented by a man and a woman in a chamber, clothed with a garment that was turned into a robe of an azure color.  [3] It was perceived that they have reference to the Isthmus 
in the brain, which is between the cerebrum and the cerebellum, through which fibers pass, and thence spread in various directions, and in every direction operate diversely in the outward things; 
also that they have reference to the Ganglia in the body, into which a nerve flows, and from there is divided into a number of fibers, some of which run one way and some another, their action being dissimilar 
in ultimates, and yet is from one beginning; thus being in ultimates dissimilar in appearance, yet similar in end. Moreover, it is known that one force acting in the extremities can have a manifold 
variation, and this according to the form there. Ends also are represented by the beginnings, such as they are in the brain, from which are the fibers; the thoughts from these ends are represented 
by the fibers from those beginnings; and the actions thence resulting by the nerves which are composed of fibers. </p>

Some spirits once came in front of me, though not before I had detected a sphere emanating from those who were evil. That sphere led me to suppose that those who were approaching were evil spirits, but 
in fact they were the enemies of such spirits. I gathered they were their enemies from the antagonistic and hostile feeling they showed towards them. As they came they positioned themselves overhead 
and addressed me, saying that they were men (homo). I replied that they were not men endowed with bodies like those which people in the world possess, who are accustomed to call themselves men because 
of the form their bodies take, but that they were nevertheless men because a person's spirit is in a true sense the man. I detected no objection to this, for they supported what I had said and went 
on to say that they were men who were all different from one another. Because it seemed impossible to me that a community of people who were all different from one another could exist in the next life, 
I therefore discussed the matter with them. I said that if a common cause were to make them a unified whole they could form a community, since they would all accordingly have the same end in view. 
They then said that they were by nature such that each individual spoke differently from all the rest and yet all thought alike. This they also demonstrated by examples, from which it could be seen that 
the perception of all was the same but that their utterances were diverse. </p>

 After this they spoke into my left ear, saying that they were good spirits and that this was their normal manner of 
speaking. I was told that these spirits arrive on the scene in large numbers, and that it is not known where they come from. I perceived that the sphere of the evil spirits was extremely hostile towards 
them, for evil spirits are subjected by them to harrying. Their community, which is a wandering one, was represented by a man and a woman in a room, dressed in a garment that was turned into a robe 
of bright blue. I perceived that they correlated with the Isthmus in the brain, which lies between the cerebrum and the cerebellum and through which fibres pass to spread out in various directions, 
acting in different ways wherever they go in external parts. In addition I perceived that they correlated with the Ganglia in the body into which nerves pass and from where they are distributed into numerous 
fibres, some of which go one way, others another, and in the outermost parts act in differing ways; yet they all have the same starting-point. Thus in the outermost parts they are seen to be different 
from one another; but so far as the end in view is concerned they are all alike. It is also a well known fact that a single force acting within the extremities can be made to vary in all kinds 
of ways, depending on the form those extremities take. Ends in view are also represented by the starting-points of fibres, like such starting-points in the brain, in which the fibres originate. The 
thoughts arising out of those ends are represented by the fibres leading from those starting-points, and the consequent actions by the nerves that are made up of the fibres. </p>

Venerunt spiritus antrorsum, et ante adventum eorum appercepta est sphaera ex malis; putabam inde quod venturi spiritus mali, sed erant eorum hostes; quod hostes eorum essent, comperiebam ex molesto 
et inimico quod inspirabant contra illos; cum veniebant, ponebant se super caput, alloquebantur me, dicendo quod homines sint; respondebam quod non homines sint praediti corpore quali homines in 
mundo, qui se solent ex corporis forma homines appellare; at usque quod homines sint quia spiritus hominis est vere homo; ad haec non appercepi renuentiam, quia confirmabant; </p>
<p>dicebant pori quod homines 
sint dissimiles, {1}hoc quia mihi impossibile visum, quod nempe societas dissimilium in altera vita detur, quare loquebar cum illis de eo, dicendo si causa communis ageret eos ad unum, quod 
usque consociari possent, quia sic unus omnibus finis: dixerunt quod tales sint ut quisque loquatur alite et tamen omnes simile cogitent; quod etiam illustrabant per exempla, per quae apparuit quod 
omnium perceptio esset una, sed loquelae diversa 2  Applicabant se dein auri meae sinistrae, et dicebant quod boni spiritus essent et quod eorum {2} sit ita loquendi; dicebatur de illis quod congregatim 
veniant, et quod non sciatur unde sunt. Sphaeram malorum spirituum percepi illis maxime infestam, mali enim sunt subjecta, quos vexant. Societas eorum quae vagabunda, repraesentata est per virum 
et feminam in camera, in vestit qui vertebatur in togam caerulei coloris. Perceptum quod illi referrent isthmum in cerebro qui inter cerebrum et cerebellum est, per quem fibrae transeunt et inde 
varie effunduntur, et quocumque vadunt aliter in externis agunt; tum quod referant ganglia in corpore, in quae influit nervus, {3}et inde in plures fibras divaricatur, quarum quaedam feruntur huc 
quaedam illuc, et in ultimis dissimiliter agunt, at usque ab uno principio, ita in ultimis dissimiliter quod apparentiam, tametsi similiter quoad finem; notum etiam est quod una vis agens in extremis 
multifariam {4}variari possit, et hoc secundum formam ibi. Fines repraesentantur quoque per principia ex quibus fibrae, qualia sunt in cerebro; </p>
<p>cogitationes inde repraesentantur per fibras ex 
principiis illis; </p>
<p>et actiones inde per nervos qui ex fibris. @1 i seu societas in qua nullus alteri similis, possibly an accidental omission.$ @2 i mos$ @3 qui$ @4 varietur$ </p>
