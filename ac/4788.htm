<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4788节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4788.</strong>“米甸人把约瑟卖到埃及”表那些处于简单良善的某种真理之人请教记忆知识。这从米甸人和约瑟的代表，以及“埃及”和“卖”的含义清楚可知：米甸人是指那些处于简单良善的真理之人（<a href="3242.htm">3242</a>，<a href="4756.htm">4756</a>节）；“埃及”是指记忆知识（<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>，<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>，<a href="2588.htm">2588</a>，<a href="4749.htm">4749</a>节）；“卖”是指疏远（<a href="4752.htm">4752</a>，<a href="4758.htm">4758</a>节）；约瑟是指神性真理。当说后者被那些处于简单良善的真理之人疏远或卖给“埃及”所表示的记忆知识时，意思是他们请教这些记忆知识。因为那些处于简单良善的真理之人很容易允许自己被感官幻觉或谬误，因而被由此而来的记忆知识引走。<br />前面（37:28）经上说，约瑟被米甸人从坑里拉上来，却被卖给以实玛利人。由此看来，他似乎只可能在埃及被以实玛利人卖掉。但他之所以被米甸人，而非以实玛利人卖掉，是因为以实玛利人代表那些处于简单良善的人（<a href="4747.htm">4747</a>节），而米甸人代表那些处于该良善的真理之人。约瑟或神性真理不可能被那些处于良善的人卖掉，只能被那些处于真理的人卖掉；因为那些处于良善的人出于良善知道何为神性真理，而那些处于真理的人却不知道。<br />教会成员分为两类，即：那些处于良善的人和那些处于真理的人。那些处于良善的人被称为属天的，而那些处于真理的人被称为属灵的。这两类人之间有很大的差别。那些处于良善的人被一种为了良善而行善，不求回报的情感所驱动。对他们来说，被允许行善本身就是回报，因为行善赋予他们喜乐的感觉。而那些处于真理的人则被一种行善的情感驱动却不是为行善本身的缘故；确切地说，他们这样做是因为他们被如此吩咐的。这些人大多数情况下会思想回报；他们的喜乐由此，以及由夸耀而来。<br />由此明显可知，那些出于良善行善的人出于内在情感行善；而那些出于真理行善的人则出于某种外在情感行善。这二者之间的差别由此变得显而易见，即：前者是内在人，后者是外在人。因此，那些系内在人的人不可能去“卖”，也就是疏远“约瑟”所代表的神性真理，因为他们出于良善觉知真理。感官幻觉或谬误，因而记忆知识不会将他们引走。但那些系外在人的人却能卖或疏远它，因为他们不是出于良善觉知真理，仅从教义和老师那里知道它。他们若请教记忆知识，就很容易允许自己被幻觉或谬误引走，因为他们没有内在指示。正因如此，约瑟被米甸人，而非以实玛利人卖掉。</p>

And the Midianites sold him into Egypt. That this signifies that those who are in some truth of simple good consulted memory-knowledges is evident from the representation of the Midianites, as being 
those who are in the truth of simple good (n. 3242, 4756); and from the signification of "Egypt," as being memory-knowledges (n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462, 2588, 4749); and from the signification of "selling," 
as being to alienate (n. 4752, 4758); and from the representation of Joseph, as being Divine truth. When this is said to be sold or alienated by those who are in the truth of simple good to memory-knowledges, 
which are "Egypt," it denotes that they consulted them; for those who are in the truth of simple good suffer themselves to be very much led away by the fallacies of the senses, and thus 
by memory-knowledges, which are therefrom. [2] It was said above (verse 28) that Joseph was drawn out of the pit by the Midianites, but that he was sold to the Ishmaelites; whence it might seem that 
he could have been sold in Egypt only by the Ishmaelites. But the reason why he was not sold by the Ishmaelites but by the Midianites, is that the Ishmaelites represent those who are in simple good 
(n. 4747), and the Midianites those who are in the truth of this good. Joseph, or the Divine truth, could not be sold by those who are in good, but only by those who are in truth; for those who are in 
good know from good what Divine truth is, but not so those who are in truth. [3] The men of the church are distinguished into two kinds - those who are in good, and those who are in truth. Those who 
are in good are called celestial, but those who are in truth are called spiritual. Between these two kinds there is a great difference. Those who are in good are in the affection of doing good for the 
sake of good, and without recompense from others; for it is recompense to them to be permitted to do good, since in so doing they perceive joy; but those who are in truth are in the affection of doing 
good, not for its own sake, but because it is so commanded, and for the most part they think of recompense; their joy is from this, and also from glorying.  [4] From this it is evident that those 
who do good from good, do it from internal affection; while those who do good from truth, do it from some external affection. Hence the difference is evident, namely, that the former are internal men, 
and the latter external. Those therefore who are internal men cannot sell, that is, alienate, the Divine truth which is represented by Joseph, because they perceive truth from good; and hence neither 
the fallacies of the senses, nor consequently memory-knowledges, lead them away. But those who are external men can sell or alienate it, because they do not perceive truth from good, but only know it 
from doctrine and teachers; and if they consult memory-knowledges, they suffer themselves to be easily led away by fallacies, for they have no inward dictate. It is for this reason that Joseph was not 
sold by the Ishmaelites, but by the Midianites. </p>

'The Midianites sold him into Egypt' means that those in whom some truth partnering simple good was present consulted facts. This is clear from the representation of 'the Midianites' as those in whom 
the truth that partners simple good is present, dealt with in <a href="3242.htm">3242</a>, <a href="4756.htm">4756</a>; from the meaning of 'Egypt' as facts, dealt with in <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>, <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>, <a href="2588.htm">2588</a>, <a href="4749.htm">4749</a>; from the meaning of 'selling' as alienating, 
dealt with in <a href="4752.htm">4752</a>, <a href="4758.htm">4758</a>; and from the representation of 'Joseph' as Divine Truth. When the latter is said to have been alienated - or 'sold' to facts, meant by 'Egypt' - by those in whom the 
truth partnering simple good is present, the meaning is that they consulted those facts. For people in whom the truth partnering simple good is present allow themselves to be led away, very much so, by 
the illusions of the senses, and so by means of facts based on these. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In verse 28 above it was stated that Joseph was drawn out of the pit by the Midianites, who then sold him to the Ishmaelites. 
From this it would seem that only the Ishmaelites could have sold him in Egypt. Yet he was not sold by the Ishmaelites but by the Midianites, and the reason for this is that the Ishmaelites represent 
those in whom simple good is present, <a href="4747.htm">4747</a>, whereas the Midianites represent those in whom the truth partnering that good is present. 'Joseph' or Divine Truth could not be sold by those who are governed 
by good, only by those governed by truth; for those governed by good know from good what Divine truth is, whereas those governed by truth have no such knowledge. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Members of the Church fall 
into two distinct categories - those governed by good and those governed by truth, the former being called celestial, the latter spiritual. Between the two there is a wide difference. Those governed 
by good are moved by an affection to do good for its own sake and without thought of reward. To them being allowed to do good is itself the reward, for doing good gives them feelings of joy. Those 
governed by truth however are not moved by an affection to do good for its own sake; rather, they are moved to do it because they have been commanded to do it. For the most part these people do think 
about reward; and this, as well as boasting about what they do, is what gives them their feeling of joy. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 From this it is evident that people motivated by good to do good act from an internal affection, 
whereas those motivated by truth to do good act from some external affection. From this the difference between the two groups may be seen, namely that the former are internal people, the latter 
external ones. Those therefore who are internal people are unable 'to sell' - that is, to alienate - Divine Truth represented by 'Joseph', because good enables them to discern what is true. Neither 
the illusions of the senses therefore, nor consequently facts, lead them away. But those who are external people are able 'to sell' or alienate it because no good is present enabling them to discern 
what is true. They do know what is true, but only because doctrine and teachers have given them that knowledge. If they consult facts they easily let themselves be led away by illusions, for they have 
no inner gift to speak to them. This now explains why Joseph was not sold by the Ishmaelites but by the Midianites. </p>

</p><b>4788.</b>
`Midianitae vendiderunt eum ad Aegyptum':  quod significet illos qui in aliquo vero simplicis boni, quod consulere scientifica, constat ex repraesentatione `Midianitarum' quod si qui in vero simplicis 
boni, de qua n. 3242, 4756; ex significatio `Aegypti' quod sint scientifica, de qua n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462, 2588, 4749; ex significatione `vendere' quod sit abalienare, de qua n. 4752, 4758; 
et ex repraesentatione `Josephi' quod sit Divini: </p>
<p>Verum; hoc cum dicitur `venditum' seu abalienatum ab illis qui in vero simplicis boni, ad scientifica, quae sunt `Aegyptus,' est quod consuluerint 
illa; qui enim in vero simplicis boni sunt, a fallaciis sensuum se plurimum abduci patiuntur, ita per scientifica quae ex illis sunt.  [2] Supra in vers. 28 dictum est quod Josephus extractus sit 
e fovea a Midianitis, sed quod venditus sit ad Jishmaelitas; inde videret quod non ab aliis vendi potuisset in Aegypto quam a Jishmaelitis; quod non [a] Jishmaelitis sed a Midianitis, est quia per 
`Jishmaelitas' repraesentantur qui in simplici bono, n. 4747, et {1} per `Midianitas' qui in vero illius boni; `Josephus' seu Divinum Verum non potuit vendi ab illis qui in bono sunt, sed ab illis 
qui in vero; qui enim bono sunt, norunt ex bono quid Divinum verum, non ita qui in vero homines Ecclesiae distincti sunt in duo genera, nempe in illos in bono et in illos qui in vero; illi qui in 
bono sunt, vocantur caelestes qui autem in vero, spirituales, inter (o)illos et hos intercedit multa differentia; qui in bono sunt, in affectione faciendi bonum sunt propter bonum, et hoc absque remuneratione; 
illis {2} remuneratio est quod liceat (t)facere bonum, nam inde gaudium percipiunt; qui autem vero sunt, non in affectione faciendi bonum sunt propter bonum sed propter quod ita mandatum, 
ac utplurimum cogitant de remuneratione, gaudium illis inde est, et quoque ex gloriatione; </p>
<p>[4] inde patet quod qui bonum faciunt ex bono, ex interna affectione faciant, at qui bonum faciunt ex 
vero, quod ab externa quadam affectione; inde differentia patet quod nempe illi sint interni homines, hi autem externi; qui itaque interni homines sunt, Divinum Verum quod per `Josephum repraesentatur, 
non `vendere', hoc est, abalienare possunt quia ex bono appercipiunt verum, inde nec fallaciae sensus, proinde nec scientifica illos abducunt; at qui externi homines sunt, illi vendere seu abalienare 
possunt quia non ex bono appercipiunt verum, sed id modo ex doctrina et (c)ex magistris sciunt; illi si consulunt scientifica, facile a fallaciis se abduci patiuntur, nam nullum dictamen intus 
habent; inde nunc est quod Josephus non a Jishmaelitis sed a Midianitis venditus sit.      @1 at$      @2 I has remuneratione illis;$ </p>
