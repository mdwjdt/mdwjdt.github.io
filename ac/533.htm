<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第533节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>533.</strong>关于拉麦，由于只提及他生了象征这种教会孕育和诞生的众子众女，所以没必要对它费心思。这些出生或众子众女如何，可从这个教会清楚看出，因为该教会的性质决定了其后代的性质。被称为“玛土撒拉”与“拉麦”的教会就在大洪水前咽下了最后一口气。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]533.</strong> As nothing more is said of Lamech, either, than that he fathered sons and daughters, which are the things conceived and born in such a church, there is no need to linger further. Just what the offspring — the daughters and sons — are can be seen from the church itself, since the offspring have the same character as the church.<br />Both the church called Methuselah and the one called Lamech passed away right before the Flood.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} By the biblical chronology, Lamech dies five years before the Flood, Methuselah in the year of the Flood. Jewish legend says that Methuselah died just before God closed up the ark (Gaer 1966, 70). [RS] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 533</b></p><p><b>533.</b>
As nothing more is related concerning Lamech than that he begat sons and daughters, which are the conceptions and births of such a church, we shall dwell no longer on the subject. What the births were, 
or the "sons and daughters" appears from the church; for such as is the church, such are the births from it. Both the churches called "Methuselah" and "Lamech" expired just before the flood. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 533</b></p><p><b>533.</b>
Since nothing further is mentioned about Lamech apart from the fact that be beget sons and daughters, who are the conceptions and births of such a Church, there is no need to pause any longer over him. 
What these births, or sons and daughters, were, becomes clear from the Church, for the character of a Church determines that of its offspring. Both those Churches called Methuselah and Lamech breathed 
their last just before the flood.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 533</b>
</p><b>533.</b>
Quia nec de Lamecho plura memorantur quam quo genuerit filios et filias qui sunt conceptus et partus talis Ecclesiae, non amplius immorandum: quinam partus, seu filii et filiae sunt, a Ecclesia constare 
potest; nam qualis Ecclesia, tales partus.  Exspiravit utraque illa Ecclesia, quae 'Methushelah et Lamech' vocatae, proxime ante diluvium. </p>
