<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10269节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10269</strong>.“和法柜”表在属于至内层天堂的属天良善里面。这从“抹法柜”的含义清楚可知，“抹法柜”是指产生一个属于至内层天堂的属天良善里面的神性的代表。“膏抹”表示产生一个主之神性的代表，如刚才所述（<a href="10268.htm">10268</a>节）；“法柜”表示至内层天堂的良善。“柜”表示至内层天堂，“法版”表示那里的主（参看<a href="9485.htm">9485</a>节）。由于在这层天堂掌权的良善是对主之爱的良善，这良善被称为属天良善，所以“抹法柜”表示产生一个属于至内层天堂的属天良善里面的主之神性的代表。此处的情形从前面各处的说明可以看出来，即：膏抹代表神性人身方面的主；因为唯独其神性人身方面的主是耶和华的受膏者。自成孕时起，主就拥有父的神性在自己、因而在祂的人性里面。谁都有可能知道，人的身体来源于父亲的本质存在，这本质存在被称为他的灵魂；因为就构成他的爱的各种情感而言，父亲的样子就在孩子身上显现出来，甚至显现在他们的脸上。每个家族都以这种方式获得自己与众不同的独特性。那么主的情况又必是什么样呢？在祂里面的神性本身就是祂那被称为灵魂的本质存在。这解释了为何主说：<br />人看见了我，就是看见了父。相信我，我在父里面，父在我里面。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.9.htm">14:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.11.htm">11</a>）</p>

And the ark of the Testimony. That this signifies in the celestial good that belongs to the inmost heaven, is evident from the signification of "anointing the ark of the Testimony," as being to induce 
a representation of the Divine in the celestial good that belongs to the inmost heaven; for by "anointing" is signified to induce a representation of the Divine of the Lord (as just above, n. 10268); 
and by "the ark of the Testimony" is signified the good of the inmost heaven. That "the ark" denotes the inmost heaven, and that "the Testimony" denotes the Lord there, may be seen above (n. 9485); 
and as the good which reigns in this heaven is the good of love to the Lord, which good is called celestial good, therefore by "anointing the ark of the Testimony" is signified to induce a representation 
of the Divine of the Lord in the celestial good that belongs to the inmost heaven. How the case herein is can be seen from what has been everywhere shown above, namely, that anointing represented 
the Lord as to the Divine Human; for the Lord as to His Divine Human was alone the anointed of Jehovah, because in Him, from conception, and consequently in His Human, there was the Divine of the Father. 
It is possible to know that the human body proceeds from the being of the father which is called his soul; for the likeness of the father in respect to the various affections which are of love appears 
in the children even in their faces. From this each family derives its own peculiarities by which it is distinguished from others. What then must have been the case with the Lord, in whom the Divine 
Itself was His being which is called the soul? Hence it is that the Lord says, "He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father. Believe Me that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me" (John 14:9, 11). </p>

'And the ark of the Testimony' means within celestial good belonging to the inmost heaven. This is clear from the meaning of 'to anoint the ark of the Testimony' as to produce a representation of what 
is Divine within celestial good belonging to the inmost heaven. 'Anointing' means producing a representation of what is Divine and the Lord's, as immediately above in <a href="10268.htm">10268</a>, and 'the ark of the Testimony' 
means the good of the inmost heaven; for 'the ark' means the inmost heaven, and 'the Testimony' the Lord there, see <a href="9485.htm">9485</a>. And since the good which reigns in that heaven is the good of love to the 
Lord - the good that is called celestial good - 'to anoint the ark of the Testimony' means to produce a representation of what is Divine and the Lord's within celestial good belonging to the inmost 
heaven. The implications of all this may be recognized from what has been shown in various places before, namely that anointing represented the Lord in respect of His Divine Human; for the Lord alone 
in respect of His Divine Human was Jehovah's Anointed. From when He was conceived He had the Father's Divinity within Himself, and consequently within His Humanity. Anyone may know that the human body 
springs from the father's essential being, called his soul; for a likeness of the father, of the various affections composing his love, manifests itself in his children, even in their faces. In this 
way any one family derives its individual character by which it is distinguished from another. What then was so in the Lord's case, who had Divinity itself within Him as His Essential Being, called the 
soul? This explains why the Lord says,  </p>
<blockquote>
He who has seen Me has seen the Father. Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:9,11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:9,11</a>.

</p><b>10269.</b>
`Et arcam testimonii': quod significet in bono caelesti quod intimi caeli, constat (c)a significatione `ungere arcam testimonii' quod sit inducere repraesentationem Divini in bono caelesti quod intimi 
caeli, per `ungere' enim significatur inducere repraesentationem Divini Domini, ut mox supra n. 10,268, et per `arcam testimonii' significatur bonum intimi caeli; quod `arca' sit intimum caelum, et 
quod `testimonium' sit Dominus ibi, videatur n. 9485; et quia bonum quod in caelo illo regnat est bonum amoris in Dominum, quod bonum vocatur bonum caeleste, ideo per `ungere arcam testimonii' significatur 
inducere repraesentationem Divini Domini in bono caelesti, quod intimi caeli. Quomodo cum his se habet, constare potest ex illis quae prius passim ostensa sunt, quod nempe unctio (x)repraesentaverit 
Dominum quoad Divinum Humanum; nam Dominus quoad Divinum Suum Humanum solus fuit Unctus Jehovae, in Ipso enim fuit Divinum {1}Patris a conceptione, et inde in Humano Ipsius; (m)quod humanum corpus 
sit procedens ex esse patris, quod vocatur anima ejus, notum esse potest, nam similitudo patris quoad affectiones varias quae sunt amoris, exstat apud liberos, etiam in faciebus (c)illorum; inde {2}unaquaevis 
familia peculiare suum trahit per {3}quod dinoscitur ab altera; quid tunc apud Dominum, in Quo ipsum Divinum fuit Esse Ipsius, quod vocatur anima? inde est quod Dominus dicat, 	{4}Qui vidit 
me, vidit Patrem; credite Mihi quod Ego in Patre et Pater in Me, Joh. xiv 9, 11.(n) @1 Bonum Divini amoris$ @2 unicuivis$ @3 quam$ @4 apud Johannem......xiv 9, 11$ </p>
