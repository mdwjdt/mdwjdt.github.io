<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7762节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7762.</strong>被说成是属于信仰并被称为信仰的信心或信靠并非属灵的信心或信靠，仅仅是属世的。属灵的信心或信靠从爱之良善，而非与良善分离的信之真理获得其本质和生命。分离之信的信心是死的；因此，那些过着邪恶生活的人不可能有真正的信心。此外，甚至信心本身，就是一个人通过主的功德得救，无论他过着怎样的生活的那种信心，同样没有任何真理根据。</p>

The confidence of trust which is said to be of faith and is called faith, is not spiritual confidence or trust, but natural. Spiritual confidence or trust has its essence and life from the good of love; 
but not from the truth of faith separate. The confidence of faith separate is dead; and therefore there cannot be true confidence with those who have led an evil life. Moreover, that confidence which 
depends on salvation through the Lord's merit, irrespective of what the life has been, is likewise not from truth.            EXODUS 11 </p>
<p>     1. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Yet one plague more 
will I bring upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterward he will let you go from hence; when he lets everything go, driving he shall drive you out from hence.      2. Say now in the ears of the people, 
and let them ask a man from his companion, and a woman from her companion, vessels of silver and vessels of gold.      3. And Jehovah gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians. Moreover, the 
man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of Pharaoh's servants, and in the eyes of the people.      4. And Moses said, Thus said Jehovah, About midnight I will go out into the midst 
of Egypt.      5. And every firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh about to sit upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the millstones; 
and every firstborn of beast.      6. And there shall be a great cry in the whole land of Egypt, such as there hath been none like it, nor shall be like it anymore.      7. And to all the sons 
of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, from man and even to beast; that ye may know that Jehovah doth separate between the Egyptians and Israel.      8. And all these thy servants shall come down 
unto me, and bow down themselves to me, saying, Get thee out, thou, and all the people that is at thy feet; and thereafter I will go out. And he went out from before Pharaoh in the wrath of anger.  
    9. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Pharaoh will not hear you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.      10. And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh; and Jehovah 
made firm the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not let the sons of Israel go out of his land. </p>

The confidence or assurance which is spoken of as a confidence in faith, and is called faith, is not spiritual, only natural confidence or assurance. Spiritual confidence or assurance derives its existence 
and life from the good of love, not from the truth of faith separated from good. Confidence in separated faith is dead. Accordingly true confidence cannot exist with those who have led an evil 
life. Nor does even the confidence itself - confidence that a person is saved through the Lord's merit irrespective of the life he led - have any basis in the truth. </p>

Confidentia seu fiducia, quae dicitur fidei et vocatur fides, non est confidentia seu fiducia spiritualis, sed naturalis; confidentia seu fiducia spiritualis essentiam et vitam suam habet ex bono amoris, 
non autem (c)ex vero fidei separato; confidentia fidei separatae est mortua; quapropter vera confidentia non dabitis est apud illos qui vitam malam {1}egerunt; ipsa etiam confidentia quod {2}salvatio 
sit per meritum Domini utcumque {3}vita fuerat, nec est ex vero. 	@1 egerant$ 	@2 salvetur$ 	@3 vixerat$ CAPUT XI 	1.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Moschen, Adhuc plagam unam adducam super Pharaonem, 
et super Aegyptum; post ita dimittet vos abhinc; sicut dimittere illum omne, expellendo expellet vos abhinc. 	2.  Dic age in auribus populi, et petant vir ex socio suo, et mulier ex socia sua, vasa 
argenti et vasa auri. 	3.  Et dedit JEHOVAH gratiam populi in (x)oculis Aegyptiorum; etiam vir Moscheh magnus valde in terra Aegypti, in oculis servorum Pharaonis, et in oculis populi. 	4.  Et dixit 
Moscheh, Ita dixit JEHOVAH, Circa medium noctis Ego exibo in medium Aegypti. 	5.  Et morietur omnis primogenitus in terra Aegypti, a primogenito Pharaonis sessuro super throno illius, usque ad primogenitum 
ancillae quae post molas; et omne primogenitum bestiae. 	6.  Et erit clamor magnus in tota terra Aegypti, qui sicut ille non fuerat, et sicut ille non addetur. 	7.  Et omnibus filiis Israelis 
non movebit canis linguam suam, ad a viro et usque ad bestiam; propterea ut sciatis quod discernat JEHOVAH inter Aegyptios et inter Israelem. 	8.  Et descendent omnes servi tui illi ad me, et incurvabunt 
se mihi, dicendo, Exi tu et omnis populus qui in pedibus tuis, et post ita exibo; et exivit a cum Pharaone in excandescentia irae. 	9.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Moschen, Non audiet ad vos Pharao; 
propterea ut multiplicari prodigia Mea in terra Aegypti. 	10.  Et Moscheh et Aharon fecerunt omnia prodigia illa coram Pharaone; et obfirmavit JEHOVAH cor Pharaonis, et non dimisit filios Israelis e 
terra sua. </p>
