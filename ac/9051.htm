<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9051节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9051.</strong>“以眼还眼”表如果在理解力的内在部分有什么东西（被它们伤害）。这从“眼”的含义清楚可知，“眼”是指理解力，在是指理解力的内在部分，其生命是信之真理。人的理解力既有一个外在部分，也有一个内在部分。其理解力的外在部分就是进入其意识的思维所在的地方；而内在部分则是不进入其意识的思维所在的地方，尽管它进入天使的意识。理解力的内在部分就是当一个人接受信时，那被主光照的部分，因为它存在于天堂之光中，含有人的属灵生命在里面。这一点在世上并未向这个人清楚显明，但在来世却向他清楚显明；这时，他成了一位天使，就在天上众天使当中。在此期间，这生命隐藏在属于理解力外在部分的思维里面，在那里产生对主、对祂里面的爱和信，对圣言，以及教会的其它一切事物的一种神圣敬畏感。“眼”表示理解力的原因是，眼睛对应于理解力，因为理解力凭天堂之光看见，而眼睛凭世界之光看见。前一种眼或理解力所看见的那些事物是属灵的，其视野是包含在此人记忆中的记忆知识。而肉眼所看见的事物是尘世的，其视野是出现在世界中的一切事物。“眼”在灵义上表示理解力，以及信，因为信构成理解力内在部分的生命（参看<a href="2701.htm">2701</a>，<a href="4403.htm">4403</a>-<a href="4421.htm">4421</a>，<a href="4523.htm">4523</a>-<a href="4534.htm">4534</a>节）。<br />凡不知道在圣言中，“眼”表示理解力的人，都不可能知道主在福音书中论到眼所说的话是什么意思，如这些话：<br />若是你的右眼叫你跌倒，就剜出来；你只有一只眼进入神的国，强如有两只眼被丢在火坑里。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.29.htm">5:29</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可9.47.htm">9:47</a>）<br />谁都知道，眼睛不会剜出来，即便它叫人跌倒；也没有人用一只眼进入神的国；相反，“右眼”表示关于主的信之虚假，这是那要剜出来的东西。还有主说的这些话：<br />眼睛就是身上的灯。你的眼睛若了亮，全身就光明；你的眼睛若昏花，全身就黑暗。你里头的光若黑暗了，那黑暗是何等大呢！（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太6.22.htm">6:22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太6.23.htm">23</a>路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路11.34.htm">11:34</a>）<br />在这段经文中，“眼睛”也不指眼睛，而是指由信之真理构成的一种理解力。这就是为何眼睛被称为“身上的灯”，又为何主说“你里头的光若黑暗了，那黑暗是何等大呢！”因为就灵义而言，“黑暗”是指信之虚假（<a href="1839.htm">1839</a>，<a href="1860.htm">1860</a>，<a href="4418.htm">4418</a>，<a href="4531.htm">4531</a>，<a href="7688.htm">7688</a>，<a href="7711.htm">7711</a>节）。<br /><br />为什么看见你弟兄眼中有刺，却不想自己眼中的梁木呢？（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.3.htm">7:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.5.htm">5</a>）<br />“看见弟兄眼中有刺”是指在一个人对真理的理解中看见某种错误的东西；“自己眼中的梁木”是指虚假的大恶，因为“木”在内义上表示良善，在反面意义上表示邪恶（<a href="643.htm">643</a>，<a href="2784.htm">2784</a>，<a href="2812.htm">2812</a>，<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>，<a href="8354.htm">8354</a>节）。此外，在来世，良善由“梁木”来代表；这就是为何那些假装自己里面有良善的人看上去扛着一根梁木，由此安全行走。如果“眼睛”和“梁木”没有这些含义，“看见眼中的梁木”会有任何意义吗？若不知道在圣言中，“眼睛”表示对真理的理解，也就是信仰，也就不可能知道主在医治瞎眼的人时，其行为暗示了什么，即：<br />祂就吐唾沫在地上，用唾沫和泥抹，对他说，你往西罗亚池子里去洗。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约9.6.htm">9:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约9.7.htm">7</a>）<br />由于主的奇迹，和所有神迹一样，都与那些属于主的国度和教会的事物有关（<a href="7337.htm">7337</a>，<a href="8364.htm">8364</a>节），所以这个奇迹也是如此。</p>

Eye for eye. That this signifies if they shall injure anything in the interior intellectual, is evident from the signification of "the eye," as being the understanding, here the interior understanding, 
the life of which is the life of faith. Man has an exterior understanding, and an interior understanding. The exterior understanding is where the thought is that comes to perception; but the interior 
understanding is where the thought is that does not come to perception; nevertheless it does come to the perception of angels. This latter understanding is that which is enlightened by the Lord when 
man receives faith, for it is in the light of heaven, and in it is the spiritual life of man, which is not so manifest to him in the world, but is manifest in the other life, when the man becomes an 
angel among the angels in heaven. Meanwhile this life lies hidden within the thought of the exterior understanding, and produces therein a holy and reverent feeling for the Lord, for love and faith in 
Him, for the Word, and for all other things of the church. The reason why "the eye" denotes the understanding, is that the eye corresponds to the understanding, for the understanding sees by virtue 
of the light of heaven, but the eye by virtue of the light of the world. Those things which the former eye or understanding sees are spiritual, and the field of its view is the memory-knowledge in man's 
memory. But the things which the external eye sees are earthly, and the field of its view is everything that appears in the world. That in the spiritual sense "the eye" denotes the understanding, and 
also faith, is because faith makes the life of the interior understanding (see n. 2701, 4403-4421, 4523-4534). [2] He who does not know that the understanding is meant in the Word by "the eye," cannot 
know what is signified by what the Lord spoke concerning the eye in the Evangelists, as by these words: </p>
<p>     If thy right eye causeth thee to stumble, pluck it out; it is good for thee to enter 
into the kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire (Mark 9:47; Matt. 5:29). Everyone knows that the eye is not to be plucked out, though it cause one 
to stumble, and that no one enters into the kingdom of God with one eye; but by "the right eye" is signified falsity of faith concerning the Lord, and this is what is to be plucked out. Again: </p>
<p>    
 The light of the body is the eye; if therefore thine eye be simple, thy whole body shall be full of light. But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be darkened. If therefore the light that is in 
thee be darkness, how great is the darkness (Matt. 6:22, 23; Luke 11:34). Neither in this passage is the eye meant by "eye," but the understanding of the truth of faith. Hence the eye is called "the 
light of the body," and it is said, "if the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is the darkness," for in the spiritual sense "darkness" denotes falsities of faith (n. 1839, 1860, 4418, 4531, 
7688, 7711). [3] And again: </p>
<p>     Why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but understandest not the beam that is in thine own eye? (Matt. 7:3-5). "To behold a mote in the eye of 
a brother" denotes something erroneous in respect to the understanding of truth; and "the beam in one's own eye" denotes the huge evil of falsity; for in the internal sense "wood" denotes good, and in 
the opposite sense evil (n. 643, 2784, 2812, 3720, 8354). Moreover in the other life good is represented by a beam; and therefore those who feign good in themselves seem to carry a beam, and thus go 
safely. Without this signification of "the eye," and of "a beam," what could be meant by "seeing a beam in the eye?" If it is not known that in the Word "the eye" denotes the understanding of truth, which 
is faith, neither can it be known what is involved in what the Lord did when He healed a blind man, that is, when "He spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle, and said unto him, Wash thee 
in the pool of Siloam" (John 9:6, 7). As the Lord's miracles, like all Divine miracles, involved those things which are of the Lord's kingdom and church (n. 7337, 8364), so also does this. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9051</b></p><p><b>9051.</b>
'Eye for eye' means if anything is injured by them in the inner part of the understanding. This is clear from the meaning of 'the eye' as the understanding, in this instance the inner part of it, the 
life of which is the life of faith. A person's understanding has an outer part and an inner part The outer part of his understanding is where thought that enters his awareness is, whereas the inner part 
is where thought that does not enter his awareness is, though it enters that of the angels. This part of the understanding is what the Lord enlightens when a person receives faith, for it exists in 
the light of heaven and holds within it a person's spiritual life. This is not made plainly evident to the person while in the world, but it is made so to that person in the next life when he becomes 
an angel among angels in heaven. In the meanwhile that life lies hidden within the thought belonging to the outer part of the understanding, producing there the holiness and reverence for the Lord, 
for love and faith in Him, for the Word, and for everything else that is the Church's. The reason why 'the eye' means the understanding is that the eye corresponds to the understanding; for the understanding 
sees in the light of heaven, but the eye sees in the light of the world. The things that the former eye, that is, the understanding, sees are spiritual, and its field of vision is the factual 
knowledge contained in the person's memory. But the things which the physical eye sees are earthly, and its field of vision consists in every object that appears in the world. Regarding 'the eye', that 
in the spiritual sense it means the understanding, and also faith since faith composes the life of the inner part of the understanding, see <a href="2701.htm">2701</a>, <a href="4403.htm">4403</a>-<a href="4421.htm">4421</a>, <a href="4523.htm">4523</a>-<a href="4534.htm">4534</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Anyone who does not know 
that 'the eye' is used in the Word to mean the understanding cannot know what the meaning is of the things which the Lord spoke concerning the eye in the Gospels, first of all these, </p>
<blockquote>
If your right 
eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes, to be cast into the Gehenna of fire. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%205:29&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 5:29</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%209:47&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 9:47</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone 
recognizes that the eye should not be plucked out even if it does cause a person to stumble, and that no one enters the kingdom of God with only one eye. But 'the right eye' means falsity in a person's 
belief about the Lord; this is what must be plucked out. Then there are these things spoken by the Lord, </p>
<blockquote>
The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is sound, your whole body will be full 
of light. If your eye is evil your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness! <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%206:22,%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 6:22, 23</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2011:34&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 11:34</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Nor is 'the eye' 
used here to mean the eye, but an understanding composed of the truth of faith. This is why the eye is called 'the lamp of the body' and why the Lord says, 'If the light that is in you is darkness, 
how great is the darkness!' For 'darkness' in the spiritual .sense is falsities constituting faith, <a href="1839.htm">1839</a>, <a href="1860.htm">1860</a>, <a href="4418.htm">4418</a>, <a href="4531.htm">4531</a>, <a href="7688.htm">7688</a>, <a href="7711.htm">7711</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 There are these words too spoken by Him, </p>
<blockquote>
Why do you notice 
the speck which is in your brother's eye, but do not consider the plank that is in your own eye? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%207:3-5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 7:3-5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Noticing a speck in a brother's eye' means seeing something erroneous in a person's 
understanding of truth; 'the plank in one's own eye' is huge evil of falsity, since 'wood' in the internal sense means good and in the contrary sense evil, <a href="643.htm">643</a>, <a href="2784.htm">2784</a>, <a href="2812.htm">2812</a>, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>, <a href="8354.htm">8354</a>. Good is also 
represented in the next life by a plank, which is why those who pretend to have good within themselves are seen carrying a plank, walking in safety as they do so. If 'eye' and 'plank' did not have these 
meanings, would 'seeing a plank in an eye' have any meaning at all? If it is not known that 'eye' in the Word means the understanding of truth, which is faith, neither can it be known what is implied 
by the Lord's action when He healed the blind man, </p>
<blockquote>
He spat on the ground and made clay with His saliva, and said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%209:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 9:6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Since all the Lord's miracles, 
like all Divine miracles, had to do with those things that belong to the Lord's kingdom and the Church, <a href="7337.htm">7337</a>, <a href="8364.htm">8364</a>, so did this miracle too. </p>

`Oculum pro oculo': quod significet si aliquid in intellectuali interiore, nempe laeserint, constat ex significatione `oculi' quod sit intellectus, hic intellectus interior, cujus vita est vita fidei; 
est homini intellectus exterior et intellectus interior; intellectus exterior est ubi cogitatio quae ad perceptionem venit, at intellectus interior est ubi cogitatio quae non ad perceptionem venit, 
sed usque ad perceptionem angelorum; hic intellectus est qui illustratur a Domino cum homo fidem recipit, nam {1}hic in luce caeli est, et in hoc est Vita hominis {2} spiritualis, quae ei non ita manifestatur 
in mundo sed in altera vita cum {3}homo fit angelus inter angelos in caelo; interea latet illa vita interius in cogitatione intellectus exterioris, ac producit sanctum et venerabundum ibi {4}pro' 
Domino, {5}pro amore et {6} fide in Ipsum, {5}pro Verbo, et {5}pro reliquis Ecclesiae.  Quod `oculus' sit intellectus, est quia oculus intellectui correspondet, intellectus enim videt ex luce caeli 
at oculus ex luce mundi; {7}illa quae ille oculus seu intellectus videt sunt spiritualia, et campus intuitionis ejus {8}est scientificum quod in memoria hominis; quae autem oculus externus videt sunt 
terrestria, et campus ejus intuitionis {9}est omne quod apparet in mundo.  Quod `oculus' in sensu spirituali sit intellectus, et quoque fides, quia haec facit vitam interioris intellectus, videatur 
n. 2701, 4403-4421, 4523-4534. 2 Qui non scit quod intellectus per `oculum' in Verbo intelligatur, non potest scire quid significant quae Dominus locutus est de oculo apud Evangelistas, ut haec, Si 
oculus dexter scandalizaverit te, erue eum; bonum tibi est unoculum ingredi in regnum Dei quam duos oculos habentem conjici in gehennam ignis, Matth. v 29; Marc. ix 47; </p>
<p>quisque novit quod oculus non 
eruendus sit etsi scandalizet, et quod nemo unoculus ingrediatur in regnum {10}Dei; sed per `oculum dextrum' significatur falsum fidei de Domino; id est quod eruendum: tum, Lucerna corporis est oculus, 
si itaque oculus tuus simplex est, totum corpus tuum lucidum erit; si oculus tuus malus fuerit, totum corpus obtenebratum erit; si ergo lumen quod in te est tenebrae est, tenebrae quantae! Matth. 
vi 22, 23; Luc. xi 34; </p>
<p>hic {11}nec oculus per `oculum' intelligitur sed intellectus veri fidei, inde vocatur oculus `lucerna corporis,' et dicitur `si lumen quod in te tenebrae est, tenebrae quantae,' 
`tenebrae' enim in sensu spirituali 3 sunt falsa fidei, n. 1839, 1860, 4418, 4531, 7688, 7711: ut et, Cur cernis festucam quae in oculo fratris tui, eam vero quae in oculo tuo trabem non intelligis? 
 Matth. vii 3-5; </p>
<p>`cernere festucam in oculo fratris' est aliquid erroneum quoad intellectum veri, `trabs quae in oculo ejus' est malum falsi ingens, `lignum' enim in sensu interno est bonum, et in 
opposito sensu (x)malum, n. 643, 2784, 2812, 3720, 8354; bonum etiam {12} repraesentatur in altera vita per trabem, {13}quare illi qui fingunt bonum apud se, gestare trabem (x)videntur, et sic tuti incedunt;
