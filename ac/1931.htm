<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1931节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1931.</strong>“对她说，撒莱的婢女夏甲”表问讯。这从整个思路清楚可知，因为天使向夏甲说话，仿佛夏甲有什么事要告诉他。耶和华询问人，而人向祂作出答复，这在圣言中是很平常的事。尽管耶和华早就知道一切，不仅知道所发生的事，还知道原因和目的，因而知道一切最细微和至内在的细节。但由于人对此一无所知，还以为没人能知道他暗中所做的事，因为没人看到，更不可能知道他在想什么，所以事情就照着这个人的信念发生了。然而，真相却是，就连极其普通平凡的灵人也能觉察人的思维，比他本人觉察得还要清晰。天使灵能觉察其思维的更内层，而天使所觉察到的事物还要内在。也就是说，天使能觉察原因和目的，而这个人本人对此所知甚少。我通过多年来持续不断的大量经历得知这一点。既然灵人和天使能觉察这些事，那么无限且赋予其他所有人觉察力的主或耶和华又会怎样呢？</p>

He said, Hagar, Sarai's handmaid. That this signifies information, is evident from the series, for Hagar is addressed by the angel as if he were to be informed. It is a common thing in the Word for Jehovah 
to question a man, and for men to reply, although Jehovah knew all before, not only what is done, but also the causes and the ends, and thus all the least and inmost things. But as man is not aware 
of this, and believes that no one can possibly know what he does in secret when no one sees it, and still less what he thinks, therefore the matter takes place according to the man's belief. But 
still it is really true that even ordinary spirits perceive a man's thoughts better than does the man himself; angelic spirits still more interior things of his thoughts; and angels things even more interior, 
namely, the causes and the ends, of which the man knows but little. It has been given me to know this by much and continual experience lasting many years. As spirits and angels perceive these 
things, what must be the case with the Lord, or Jehovah, who is infinite, and who gives to all their ability to perceive.  </p>

That 'he said, Hagar, Sarai's servant-girl' means information is clear from the train of thought, for Hagar is addressed by the angel as if she were to inform him of something. In the Word, even though 
Jehovah knows already, it is common for Jehovah to question someone and for people to make replies to Him. He knows not only what took place but also the causes and the ends, thus every least intimate 
detail. But since a person is not aware of this and believes that nobody else can possibly know what he does in secret, and still less what he thinks, that which takes place therefore does so in accordance 
with his belief. But the truth of the matter is that even quite common and ordinary spirits perceive a person's thoughts better than the person does himself. Angelic spirits perceive the more 
interior aspects of his thoughts, and angels those that are more interior still, that is to say, the causes and the ends in view about which the person himself knows but little. This I have been given 
to know from much and continuing experience lasting for many years. Since spirits and angels perceive those things, what then must the perception be of the Lord or Jehovah, who is Infinite, and who 
enables all others to perceive? </p>

</p><b>1931.</b>
`Dixit, Hagar, ancilla Sarai':  quod significet informationem, constat ex serie, nam est appellatio Hagaris ab angelo sicut informaretur: in Verbo sollemne est quod Jehovah interroget hominem et homines 
respondeant, tametsi Jehovah id prius novit, nec solum factum sed etiam causas et fines, ita omnia minima et intima, sed quia homo hoc nescit, et credit quod nusquam aliquis sciat quod in occulto, 
non vidente aliquo, facit, et minus {1}quod cogitat, ideo secundum fidem hominis ita fit: sed usque ita se in veritate habet quod spiritus vulgares cogitationes hominis percipiunt melius quam ipse homo; 
spiritus angelici adhuc interiora cogitationum; et angeli adhuc interiora, nempe causas et fines, de quibus homo parum novit; hoc (c)a multa et continua plurium annorum experientia scire datum. Cum 
illa spiritus et angeli percipiunt, quid non Dominus seu Jehovah Qui Infinitus, et omnibus dat percipere? </p>
