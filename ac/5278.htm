<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5278节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5278.</strong>“在埃及地的一切丰收必都被忘掉”表在属世层的这两部分中，真理的移除和看似剥夺。这从“忘掉”或“被忘掉”、“丰收”和“埃及地”的含义清楚可知：“忘掉”或“被忘掉”是指移除和由此产生的看似剥夺；“丰收”是指真理的增多，或增多的真理，如刚才所述（<a href="5276.htm">5276</a>节）；“埃及地”是指属世心智，或人的属世层，在此是指属世层的这两个部分，如刚才所述（<a href="5276.htm">5276</a>节）。<br />“忘掉”或“被忘掉”之所以表示移除和看似剥夺，是因为与此类似的事就发生在记忆和仰赖记忆的思维上。人正在思考的实际事物直接在他的注意力之下，而与其相关的事物则在它们周围有序展开，甚至延伸到最远处、那时已被遗忘的不相关的事物那里。性质相反的事物则与其它事物分离，并垂了下去，在下面显示自己，在那里平衡上面的事物。这种有序排列通过所流入的良善实现，这就是人的整个思维有序排列的方式。这一事实从来世人们的思维可以看出来；因为在那里，人们的思维在天堂之光中有时以可见的方式呈现出来，这是很正常的；在这种时候，这些思维的排列形式就被展示出来。由此可见“忘掉”在内义上表示移除和看似剥夺。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5278</b></p><p><b>5278.</b>
And all the abundance of produce shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt. That this signifies the removal of truth and the apparent privation of it in both naturals, is evident from the signification 
of "forgetting," or "being forgotten," as being removal and hence apparent privation; and from the signification of "abundance of produce," as being the multiplication of truth, or truth multiplied (of 
which just above, n. 5276); and from the signification of the "land of Egypt," as being the natural mind or the natural of man, here both naturals (as just above, n. 5276). That "forgetting," or "being 
forgotten," denotes removal and apparent privation, is because such is the case with the memory and hence with the thought. What a man thinks about is directly under his view, and things related 
thereto present themselves around in order, even to those unrelated, which are most remote, and thus forgotten. Things opposite are separated from the rest and hang down, and present themselves underneath, 
and balance those above. This setting in order is effected by means of the good that flows in, and such is the case with all man's thinking. That such is the case appears from thoughts in the other 
life; for in the light of heaven thoughts there are wont to be sometimes presented to view, and then such a form of their arrangement is seen. From this it is evident that "forgotten," in the internal 
sense, is nothing else than removal and apparent privation. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5278</b></p><p><b>5278.</b>
'And all the abundance of corn in the land of Egypt will be thrust into oblivion' means the removal of truth and the seeming deprivation of it in both parts of the natural. This is clear from the meaning 
of forgetting or 'being thrust into oblivion' as a removal and the seeming deprivation that results from this; from the meaning of 'the abundance of corn' as the multiplication of truth, that is, 
truth that has been multiplied, dealt with just above in <a href="5276.htm">5276</a>; and from the meaning of 'the land of Egypt' as the natural mind or a person's natural, both parts of it in this case, as just above in <a href="5276.htm">5276</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
The reason forgetting or 'being thrust into oblivion' means a removal and seeming deprivation is that something akin to this happens to the memory and to thought that relies on it. The actual 
matters that a person is thinking about are immediately beneath his attention, while related matters spread out in order around them, extending to unrelated ones furthest away, which at that time 
are in oblivion. Matters of a contrary nature are separated from these, hanging downwards and revealing themselves underneath, where they serve to counterbalance what is above them. This ordered arrangement 
is effected by means of good flowing in Such is the way in which the whole of a person's thought is ordered. The truth of this can be seen from people's thoughts in the next life. There in the 
light of heaven it is quite normal for people's thoughts to be presented sometimes in a visual manner, at which times the form in which those thoughts are arranged is demonstrated. From this it may be 
seen that 'forgetting' in the internal sense means nothing else than a removal and seeming deprivation. </p>

</p><b>5278.</b>
`Et oblivioni dabitur omnis abundantia annonae in terra Aegypti':  quod significet remotionem veri et privationem ejus apparentem in utroque naturali, constat ex significatione oblivisci seu `oblivioni 
dari' quod sit remotio et inde privatio apparens; ex significatione `abundantiae annonae' quod sit multiplicatio veri seu multiplicatum verum, de qua mox supra n. 5276; et ex significatione 'terrae 
Aegypti' quod sit mens naturalis seu naturale hominis, hic utrumque, ut mox supra n. 5276. [2] Quod oblivisci seu `oblivioni dari' sit remotio et privatio apparens, est quia ita se habet cum memoria 
et inde cogitatione; illa de quibus homo cogitat, sunt immediate sub ejus intuitu, et quae ei rei affinia sunt, se sistunt ordine circum, usque ad non affinia quae sunt remotissima, et tunc in oblivione; 
quae opposita sunt, inde separantur, et pendent deorsum, et se sistunt subter, et aequilibrant illa quae supra sunt; ordinatio haec fit per bonum quod influit; ita se habet cum omni cogitatione 
hominis; quod ita se habeat, ex cogitationibus in altera vita apparet, cogitationes enim ibi in luce caeli solent quandoque visibiles sisti, et tunc apparet talis earum dispositionis forma; inde constare 
potest quod `oblivisci' in sensu interno non aliud sit quam remotio, et privatio apparens. </p>
