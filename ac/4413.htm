<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4413节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4413.</strong>我通过活生生的经历得知，天堂之光含有聪明和智慧在里面，并且出自主、本质为真理的聪明和本质为良善的智慧在天使眼前就显为光。我曾被提升进入如同钻石所放射的光芒那样闪耀的光中；我被保持在它里面的时候，就觉得自己退离了肉体观念，被带入了属灵观念，进而被带入那些属于真理与良善的聪明事物中。那时，我那些源于尘世之光的思维观念似乎远离了我，仿佛不再属于我，尽管它们仍模模糊糊地存在。我由此得知，人越进入天堂之光，就越进入聪明。这解释了为何天使越聪明，他们所在的光就越大、越明亮。</p>

That the light of heaven has within it intelligence and wisdom, and that it is the intelligence of truth and the wisdom of good from the Lord that appear as light before the eyes of the angels, it has 
been given me to know by a living experience. I was taken up into a light that sparkled like the light radiating from diamonds; and while I was kept in it, I seemed to myself to be withdrawn from bodily 
ideas and to be brought into spiritual ideas, thus into those things which belong to the intelligence of truth and of good. The ideas of thought which originated from the light of the world then 
appeared to be remote from me, and as it were not belonging to me, although they were present obscurely; and by this it was given me to know that insofar as anyone comes into the light of heaven, so far 
he comes into intelligence. It is for this reason that the more intelligent the angels are, the greater and the brighter is the light in which they are. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4413</b></p><p><b>4413.</b>
The fact that the light of heaven holds intelligence and wisdom within it, and the Lord's gift of intelligence, which essentially is truth, and of wisdom, which essentially is good, are seen by angels' 
eyes as light, I have been given to know through actual experience. I was raised up into light which was flashing like the sparkling light of diamonds. While I was kept in this light it seemed to me 
that I was taken away from bodily ideas to spiritual ones, and so to matters belonging to an intelligent understanding of what was true and good. Ideas present in my thinking which had been formed in 
the light of the world seemed at that time to have been removed from me and so to speak no longer belonged to me, although they were vaguely present. From this I was given to know that insofar as a 
person enters the light of heaven he enters intelligence. This explains why the more intelligent the angels are, the greater and brighter is the light in which they dwell. </p>

</p><b>4413.</b>
Quod lux caeli in se habeat intelligentiam et sapientiam et quod sit intelligentia veri et sapientia boni a Domino, quae coram oculis angelorum ut {1} lux apparet, per vivam experientiam mihi scire 
datum est; elevatus sum in lucem quae scintillabat sicut lux radiosa ex adamantibus; in qua cum tenerer, visus sum mihi abduci ab ideis corporeis ac induci in ideas spirituales ac ita in illa quae 
sunt intelligentiae veri et boni; ideae cogitationis quae a luce mundi suam originem traxerunt, apparebant tunc a me remotae et quasi ad me non pertinentes, tametsi obscure aderant: inde nosse datum, 
quod quantum homo in lucem illam venit, tantum in intelligentiam: inde est quod [quo] intelligentiores angeli sunt, eo in majore et illustriore luce sint {2}.      @1 i in caelis$      @2 i 
inde etiam vocantur lucis angeli$ </p>
