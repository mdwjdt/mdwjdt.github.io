<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6964节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6964.</strong>“耶和华说”表提供展示，即展示那些属于属灵教会的人若真的有信，将是何性质。这从“耶和华说”的含义清楚可知，“耶和华说”是指提供，如前所述（<a href="6951.htm">6951</a>节）。它表示提供展示，即展示他们若真的有信，将是何性质；这一点从下文明显看出来。因为他的“手复原了，像别处的肉一样”表示他们将拥有属灵良善；其对立面就是手因放在怀里而长了大麻疯，以此表示那些属于属灵教会的人若没有信，就会亵渎真理（参看<a href="6959.htm">6959</a>，<a href="6963.htm">6963</a>节）。</p>

And he said. That this signifies providence in respect to what would be the quality of those of the spiritual church if they did have faith, is evident from the signification of "Jehovah said," as being 
providence (as above, n. 6951); that it denotes what their quality would be if they did have faith, is plain from what follows. For by "his hand turned again as his flesh" is signified that then they 
would have spiritual good; the opposite of which is that the hand became leprous by being brought into his bosom, by which is signified that they who are of the spiritual church would be in the profanation 
of truth, if they did not have faith (see above, n. 6959, 6963). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6964</b></p><p><b>6964.</b>
'And He said' means providence showing what those who belonged to the spiritual Church were going to be like if they did possess faith. This is clear from the meaning of 'Jehovah said' as providence, 
as above in <a href="6951.htm">6951</a> The fact that it was providence showing what they were going to be like if they did possess faith is evident from the things that follow in the narrative. For the restoration of his 
hand like his [other] flesh means that then spiritual good would reside with them, and this is the opposite of his hand's becoming leprous when he put it into his bosom, which means that the profanation 
of truth would exist with those who belonged to the spiritual Church if they were not in possession of faith, dealt with above in <a href="6959.htm">6959</a>, <a href="6963.htm">6963</a>. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 6964</b>
</p><b>6964.</b>
`Et dixit': quod significet providentiam quales futuri qui ab Ecclesia spirituali si fidem haberent, constat ex significatione `dixit Jehovah' quod sit providentia, ut supra n. 6951; quod sit quales 
futuri si fidem haberent, ex sequentibus patet; nam per quod `manus reversa fuerit sicut caro ejus' significatur quod tunc illis spirituale bonum; cui oppositum est quod `manus per adductionem in sinum 
facta sit leprosa,' per quod significatur quod in profanatione veri essent illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali si non fidem haberent, de qua supra n. 6959, 6963. </p>
