<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>588.</strong>但经上宣称主“后悔”、“心中忧伤”，是因为全人类的怜悯似乎都是这种感觉，所以象圣言的很多其它经文一样，这里论说主“后悔”和“心中忧伤”也是照着表象说的。但没人知道何为主的怜悯，因为它无限超出人类理解的范畴；但我们都知道人的怜悯就是后悔和忧伤；除非人根据自己的领悟对怜悯形成某种思想，否则他不可能对它有任何观念，从而不可能受到指教；这就是为什么人类的特性常常被归到耶和华或主身上的原因，如耶和华或主惩罚、试探、毁灭、发烈怒；而事实上，祂从不惩罚人，从不试探，从不毁灭任何人，也从不发怒。由于这类事都被归到主的身上，所以可推知，后悔和忧伤也可能被归到主身上；此推断是从彼推断得出的，这一点从以下圣言经文清楚可知。<br />②以西结书：<br />我的怒气必要成就，我将使我的愤怒再次止息，我也将后悔。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结5.13.htm">5:13</a>）<br />此处，因为“怒气”和“愤怒”都被归到主身上，所以“后悔”也被归到祂那里。撒迦利亚书：<br />你们列祖惹我发怒的时候，我怎样定意降祸，并不后悔；现在我照样定意施恩与耶路撒冷和犹大家。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚8.14.htm">8:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚8.15.htm">15</a>）<br />此处经上说，耶和华“定意降祸”，而事实上，祂从不思想降祸于人，而是向每一个人行善。当摩西求耶和华的情面时：求你转意，不发你的烈怒；后悔，不降祸与你的百姓。于是耶和华后悔，不把所说的祸降与他的百姓。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出32.12.htm">32:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出32.14.htm">14</a>）<br />此处“烈怒”以及由此而来的后悔也被认为属于耶和华。约拿书：<br />尼尼微的王说，神转意后悔，不发烈怒，使我们不至灭亡，也未可知。（约拿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/拿3.9.htm">3:9</a>）<br />这里的“后悔”同样被归于祂，因为“烈怒”是如此。<br />③何西阿书：<br />我回心转意，我的后悔大大发动；我必不发猛烈的怒气。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何11.8.htm">11:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何11.9.htm">9</a>）<br />这里论及心时所说“后悔大大发动”和“心中忧伤”一个意思。“后悔”明显表示富有怜悯。同样在约珥书：<br />归向耶和华你们的神，因为他有恩典，有怜悯，有长久的忍耐，有丰盛的慈爱，并且后悔不降所说的灾。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.13.htm">2:13</a>）<br />这里再次出现的“后悔”显然表示怜悯。耶利米书：<br />或者他们肯听从，各人回头离开恶道，使我后悔不将灾祸降与他们。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶26.3.htm">26:3</a>）<br />“后悔”表示有怜悯。耶利米书：<br />那一邦若是转意离开它的恶，我就必后悔，不降灾祸。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶18.8.htm">18:8</a>）<br />这里的“后悔”也表示若他们回头，就怜悯他们，因为正是人转离了主的怜悯，主从不将怜悯转离人。 </p>

<p><strong>[NCE]588.</strong> But the Lord is said to feel regret and to grieve at heart because these activities seem to lie at the core of all human mercy. The language of this passage, like that of many others in the Word, goes along with the appearance. The true nature of the Lord's mercy no one can know, because it infinitely transcends all human comprehension. But the nature of our own mercy we recognize, and that nature is to feel sorry and to grieve.<br />If we did not form an idea of mercy from some other feeling whose nature we do recognize, we could not think or learn anything about it at all. This is why human traits are frequently used to describe Jehovah's attributes, or in other words, the Lord's. For instance, Jehovah — the Lord — is said to punish, lead into crisis, destroy, and burn with anger, when the truth is that he never punishes anyone, never inflicts trouble on anyone, never destroys anyone, and never burns with anger. Because such claims are indeed made about the Lord, then, it follows that regret and grief are also attributed to him, since the one claim is a result of the other. This can be clearly seen from the following places in the Word.<br />[2] In Ezekiel:<br />My anger will be fulfilled, I will put my wrath to rest, and I will relent. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_588/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_5_13" target=_top>Ezekiel 5:13</a>)<br />Since this verse ascribes anger and wrath to him, it also speaks of him as relenting. In Zechariah:<br />"Just as I thought to do evil when your ancestors aroused anger in me," Jehovah Sabaoth has said, "and I did not relent, so, in turn, will I think in those days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_588/bible_king-james-version_zechariah_8_14-15" target=_top>Zechariah 8:14-15</a>)<br />It says here that Jehovah thought to do evil when in reality he never thinks to do evil to anyone but good to each and every person. In Moses, when Moses entreated Jehovah:<br />"Turn back from the wrath of your anger and relent from the evil done to your people." And Jehovah relented from the evil that he had said he would do to his people. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_588/bible_king-james-version_exodus_32_12" target=_top>Exodus 32:12</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_588/bible_king-james-version_exodus_32_14" target=_top>14</a>)<br />Here too wrath and anger are attributed to Jehovah and he is therefore said to have relented. In Jonah, the king of Nineveh said:<br />Who knows? Perhaps God will turn and relent, to turn back from the heat of his anger, and we will not be destroyed. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_588/bible_king-james-version_jonah_3_9" target=_top>Jonah 3:9</a>)<br />Once again he is said to relent because he is said to have been angry.<br />[3] In Hosea:<br />A change of heart has come over me; at the same time my regrets have burned. I will not carry out the wrath of my anger. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_588/bible_king-james-version_hosea_11_8-9" target=_top>Hosea 11:8-9</a>)<br />This too speaks of his heart and the regrets burning there, just as the verse under discussion says that he grieved at heart. The regrets clearly stand for great mercy. Likewise in Joel:<br />Turn back to Jehovah your God, since he is indulgent and compassionate, patient and abounding in mercy, and regretful over evil. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_588/bible_king-james-version_joel_2_13" target=_top>Joel 2:13</a>)<br />In this place as well regret plainly symbolizes mercy. In Jeremiah:<br />If perhaps they listen and turn back, a man from his wicked way, and I regret the evil ... (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_588/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_26_3" target=_top>Jeremiah 26:3</a>)<br />Having regret stands for having mercy. In the same author:<br />If that nation turns back from its evil, I will relent from evil. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_588/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_18_8" target=_top>Jeremiah 18:8</a>)<br />Again, relenting stands for having mercy — if they turn back. We are the ones who turn away from the Lord's mercy; the Lord never turns away from us. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 588</b></p><p><b>588.</b>
But it is predicated of the Lord that He "repents" and "is grieved at heart" because there appears to be such a feeling in all human mercy, so that what is said here of the Lord's "repenting" and "grieving" 
is spoken according to the appearance, as in many other passages in the Word. What the mercy of the Lord is none can know, because it infinitely transcends the understanding of man; but what the 
mercy of man is we all know to be to repent and grieve; and unless a man were to form his idea of mercy according to his own apprehension, he could not have any conception of it, and thus he could 
not be instructed; and this is the reason why human properties are often predicated of the attributes of Jehovah or the Lord, as that Jehovah or the Lord punishes, leads into temptation, destroys, and 
is angry; when yet He never punishes anyone, never leads any into temptation, never destroys any, and is never angry. But as even such things as these are predicated of the Lord, it follows that repentance 
also and grief may be predicated of Him; for the predication of the one follows from that of the other, as plainly appears from the following passages in the Word.  [2] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Mine 
anger shall be consummated, I will make my wrath to rest, and it shall repent Me (Ezek. 5:13). Here, because "anger" and "wrath" are predicated, " repentance" is predicated also. In Zechariah: </p>
<p>     
As I thought to do evil when your fathers provoked Me to anger, saith Jehovah Zebaoth, and it repented Me not, so again I will think in those days to do good unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah (Zech. 
8:14, 15). Here it is said that Jehovah "thought to do evil" and yet He never thinks to do evil to any, but good to all and to everyone. In Moses, when he prayed forbearance of the face of Jehovah: </p>
<p> 
    Turn from the wrath of Thine anger and repent Thee of this evil against Thy people; and Jehovah repented of the evil which He said He would do unto His people (Exod. 32:12, 14). Here also 
the "wrath of anger" is attributed to Jehovah, and consequently "repentance." In Jonah, the king of Nineveh said: </p>
<p>     Who knoweth whether God will not turn and repent, and turn from the heat of His 
anger, that we perish not? (Jonah 3:9). In like manner here "repentance" is predicated because "anger" is.  [3] In Hosea: </p>
<p>     My heart is turned within me; My repentings are kindled together; I will 
not execute the wrath of Mine anger (Hosea 11:8, 9) where likewise it is said of the heart that" repentings were kindled" just as in the passage we are considering it is said that He "grieved at heart." 
Repentings" plainly denote great mercy. So in Joel: </p>
<p>     Turn unto Jehovah your God; for He is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and plenteous in mercy, and repenteth of the evil (Joel 
2:13) where also to " repent" manifestly denotes mercy. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, and it repent Me of the evil (Jer. 26:3), signifying to have 
mercy. Again: </p>
<p>     If that nation turn from their evil, it shall repent Me of the evil (Jer. 18:8); </p>
<p>where also to "repent" denotes to have mercy provided they would turn. For it is man who turns 
the Lord's mercy away from himself: the Lord never turns it away from man. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 588</b></p><p><b>588.</b>
The Lord is referred to as repenting and grieving in heart however because all human mercy seems to involve those feelings. Consequently as is the case many times elsewhere in the Word, the manner of 
speaking here is in accordance with the outward appearance. Nobody can know what the Lord's mercy is, for it infinitely transcends all human understanding. But one does know what human mercy is; it is 
repenting and grieving. And unless a person grasps the idea of mercy from some different feeling whose nature he knows, he can have no possible conception of it and so cannot learn anything about it. 
This is the reason why human characteristics are frequently attributed to Jehovah, or the Lord - for example, that Jehovah or the Lord punishes, leads into temptation, destroys, and burns with anger, 
when in fact He never punishes anybody, never leads anybody into temptation, never destroys anybody, and never burns with anger. Now seeing that such things are attributed to the Lord, repentance and 
grief may be attributed as well, for the attribution of the one follows on from that of the other, as is quite clear from the following places in the Word: </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
My anger will be accomplished, 
I will make My wrath die down again, and I will repent. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%205:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 5:13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here, because 'anger' and 'wrath' are attributed to Him, 'repenting' is attributed as well. In Zechariah,  </p>
<blockquote>
As I thought 
to do Evil when your fathers provoked Me to anger, said Jehovah Zebaoth, and I did not repent, so again I will think in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%208:14,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 8:14, 15</a>.   
</blockquote>
Here it is said that Jehovah 'thought to do evil', when in fact He never thinks to do evil to anyone, but good to every single human being. And when Moses sought to placate the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of Jehovah, 
Turn from the heat of Your anger, and repent over the evil of Your people. And Jehovah repented over the evil which He said He would do to His people. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2032:12,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 32:12, 14</a>.   Here also the heat of anger, 
and consequently repentance, is ascribed to Jehovah. In Jonah,  </p>
<p>The king of Ninevah [said], Who knows, God may turn and repent, and turn from the heat of His anger, and we shall not perish! Jonah 
3:9.  </p>
<p>Here similarly 'repentance' is attributed to Him because 'anger' is also.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Hosea,  </p>
<blockquote>
My heart has turned within Me, and at the same time My repentings have been kindled; I will 
not execute the heat of My anger. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%2011:8,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 11:8, 9</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'repentings having been kindled', said of the heart, is similar in meaning to 'He was grieved in heart'. 'Repentings' clearly stands for abundant 
mercy. Similarly in Joel,  </p>
<blockquote>
Return to Jehovah your God, for He is gracious and merciful, long-suffering, abounding in mercy, and repenting of evil. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%202:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 2:13</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here again 'repenting' quite clearly 
means mercy. In Jeremiah,   It may be they will listen and every man turn from his evil way, that I may repent of the evil. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2026:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 26:3</a>.  </p>
<p>'Repent' stands for having mercy. In the same prophet, 
 </p>
<blockquote>
If that nation turns from its evil, I will repent of the evil. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2018:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 18:8</a>.   
</blockquote>
Here also 'repenting' stands for having mercy on them if only they would turn back, for it is man who turns the Lord's 
mercy away from himself. It is never the Lord who turns it away from man.

Sed praedicatur de Domino quod 'paeniteat et doleat ad cor,' quia tale apparet inesse omni misericordiae humanae; quare secundum apparentiam hic, ut multoties alibi in Verbo, locutum. Quid misericordia
