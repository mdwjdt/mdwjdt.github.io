<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5646节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5646.</strong>创世记43:18-23.那些人因为他们被领到约瑟的屋里，就害怕，说，我们被领到这地方，必是因为当初归还在我们口袋里的银子，痛责我们，抓住我们，把我们当奴仆，抢夺我们的驴。他们就挨进管约瑟家的那人，屋门口和他说话，说，我主阿，我用名誉担保，我们当初下来实在是要买粮。后来到了客栈，我们打开口袋，看哪，各人的银子，我们分量足数的银子，仍在各人的口袋内，现在我们手里又带回来了。又带下另外的银子在我们手里来买粮。不知道谁把银子放在我们的口袋里。他说，你们平安，不要害怕，是你们的神和你们父亲的神赐给你们隐藏的礼物在你们的口袋里。你们的银子早已到我这里来了。他就把西缅带出来给他们。<br />“那些人就害怕”表退却。“因为他们被领到约瑟的屋里”表因为属于属世层的真理要被联结并顺服于内在。“说，我们被领到这地方，必是因为当初归还在我们口袋里的银子”表由于属世层中的真理看似白白赐予，所以它们正变得顺服。“痛责我们，抓住我们”表因此，它们服从它的绝对权柄和掌控。“把我们当奴仆，抢夺我们的驴”表直到凡存在于属世层的任一部分中的东西都变得一文不值，如同无有。“他们就挨进管约瑟家的那人”表教会的教义。“屋门口和他说话”表它们关于引入的请教。“说，我主阿，我用名誉担保”表一个证明。“我们当初下来实在是要买粮”表为真理获得良善的一种意向。“后来到了客栈，我们打开口袋”表对外层属世层的检查。“看哪，各人的银子，仍在各人的袋口内”表清楚发现真理可以说是白白赐予的。“我们分量足数的银子”表与各人的状态相称的真理。“现在我们手里又带回来了”表白白赐予的东西会尽可能地顺服。“又带下另外的银子在我们手里来买粮”表通过来自另一个源头的真理获得良善的意向。“不知道谁把银子放在我们的口袋里”表由于不知道存在于外层属世层中的真理来自何处而缺乏信仰。“他说，你们平安，不要害怕”表一切安好，让他们不要绝望。“是你们的神和你们父亲的神”表主的神性人身。“赐给你们隐藏的礼物在你们的口袋里”表它来自祂，无需他们的任何计谋。“你们的银子早已到我这里来了”表真理看似已被他们获得。“他就把西缅带出来给他们”表他将这些真理与实践它们的意愿相联结。</p>

Verses 18-23. And the men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph's house; and they said, Over the word of the silver that was returned in our bags in the beginning are we brought; to roll down 
upon us, and to cast himself upon us, and to take us for servants, and our asses. And they came near to the man that was over Joseph's house, and they spoke unto him at the door of the house, and said, 
In me, my lord, in coming down we came down in the beginning to buy food; and it came to pass when we came to the inn and we opened our bags, and behold everyone's silver in the mouth of his bag, 
our silver in its weight; and we have brought it back in our hand. And other silver have we brought down in our hand to buy food; we know not who put our silver in our bags. And he said, Peace be to 
you, fear not; your God, and the God of your father, gave you a hidden gift in your bags; your silver came to me. And he brought Simeon out unto them. "And the men were afraid," signifies a drawing back; 
"because they were brought to Joseph's house," signifies because the truths that belonged to the natural were to be adjoined and subjected to the internal; "and they said, Over the word of the silver 
that was returned in our bags in the beginning are we brought," signifies because truth in the exterior natural appears to be given gratuitously, they were therefore to be in subjection; "to roll 
down upon us and to cast himself upon us," signifies that on this account they were to be reduced under absolute power; "and to take us for servants and our asses," signifies until whatever is in either 
natural be as nothing; "and they came near to the man that was over Joseph's house," signifies the doctrinals of the church; "and they spoke unto him at the door of the house," signifies taking counsel 
of them about introduction; "and said, In me, my lord," signifies a testifying; "in coming down we came down in the beginning to buy food," signifies a disposition to procure good for truths; "and 
it came to pass when we came to the inn and we opened our bags," signifies introspection into the exterior natural; "and behold everyone's silver in the mouth of his bag," signifies that it was clearly 
seen that truths had been given as it were gratuitously; "our silver in its weight," signifies truths according to each one's state; "and we have brought it back in our hand," signifies that what 
had been given gratuitously would be in submission as far as possible; "and other silver have we brought down in our hand to buy food," signifies that there is a disposition to procure good by means of 
truth from another source; "we know not who put our silver in our bags," signifies non-belief, from ignorance of the source of truth in the exterior natural; "and he said, Peace be to you, fear not," 
signifies that it is well, let them not despair; "your God, and the God of your father," signifies the Lord's Divine Human; "gave you a hidden gift in your bags," signifies that it was from Him without 
any prudence of theirs; "your silver came to me," signifies that it will seem as truth procured by them; "and he brought Simeon out unto them," signifies that he adjoined will to truths. </p>

Verses 18-23 And the men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph's house; and they said, Over the matter of the silver put back in our pouches at the beginning are we brought to [this place], 
so that he may come down on us and fall on us,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and take us as slaves, and our asses. And they came near the man who was over Joseph's house, and they spoke to him [at]<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> the door (ostium) of the house. 
And they said, On my honour,<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> my lord, we certainly came down at the beginning to buy food. And it happened, when we came to the lodging-place and opened our pouches, that behold, each man's silver 
was in the mouth of his pouch, our silver in its full weight; and we are bringing it back in our hand. And we are causing other silver to come down in our hand to buy food; we do not know who put 
our silver in our pouches. And he said, Peace to you, do not be afraid; your God and the God of your father has given you the concealed gift in your pouches; your silver came to me. And he brought Simeon 
out to them. </p>
<p>'And the men were afraid' means a drawing back. 'Because they were brought to Joseph's house' means that the truths belonging to the natural were to be linked and made subservient 
to the internal. 'And they said, Over the matter of the silver put back in our pouches at the beginning are we brought to [this place]' means that because truth in the exterior natural appears to be something 
freely given, they were being made subservient. 'So that he may come down on us and fall on us' means that for this reason they were subjected to its absolute power and control. 'And take us 
as slaves, and our asses' means even to the point where whatever exists in either part of the natural is of no worth. 'And they came near the man who was over Joseph's house' means the teachings of the 
Church. 'And they spoke to him [at] the door of the house' means a consultation of these regarding the introduction. 'And they said, On my honour, my lord' means an attestation. 'We certainly came down 
at the beginning to buy food' means a mind set on acquiring good for truths. 'And it happened, when we came to the lodging-place and opened our pouches' means an inspection of the exterior natural. 
'That behold, each man's silver was in the mouth of his pouch' means that it was observed that the truths had been so to speak freely given. 'Our silver in its full weight' means truths commensurate 
with each one's state. 'And we are bringing it back in our hand' means the submission as far as possible of what had been freely given. 'And we are causing other silver to come down in our hand to buy 
food' means that the mind is set on acquiring good through truth from some other source. 'We do not know who put our silver in our pouches' means an absence of faith owing to ignorance of where the 
truth present in the exterior natural came from. 'And he said, Peace to you, do not be afraid' means that all is well, they should not despair. 'Your God and the God of your father' means the Lord's Divine 
Human. 'Has given you the concealed gift in your pouches' means that it came from Him without the exercise of any prudence by them. 'Your silver came to me' means that it will seem as though truth 
has been acquired by them. 'And he brought Simeon out to them' means that he linked to those truths the will to practise them.

Vers. 18-23.  Et timuerunt viri quod adducti domum Josephi, et dixerunt, Super verbum argenti reducti in manticis nostris in initio nos adducimur, ad devolvendum super nos, et ad conjiciendum se super 
nos, et ad sumendum nos ad servos, et asinos nostros.  Et accesserunt ad virum qui super domo Josephi, et locuti ad illum ostio domus.  Et dixerunt, In me domine mi, descendendo descendimus in initio 
ad emendum cibum.  Et factum, cum veniremus ad diversorium, et aperuimus manticas nostras, et ecce argentum cujusvis in ore manticae suae, argentum nostrum in pondere suo, et reducimus illud manu nostra. 
 Et argentum alterum descendere facimus in manu nostra ad emendum cibum, non scimus quis posuit argentum nostrum in manticis nostris.  Et dixit, Pax vobis, ne timeatis, Deus vester, et Deus patris 
vestri dedit vobis absconditum donum in manticis vestris, argentum vestrum venit ad me; et eduxit ad illos Shimeonem.  `Et timuerunt viri' significat retractionem:  `quod adducti domum Josephi' significat 
quod vera quae naturalis adjungerentur et subjicerentur interno:  `et dixerunt, Super verbum argenti reducti in manticis nostris (x)in initio nos adducimur' significat quia verum in exteriore 
naturali apparet gratis donatum, quod ideo subjicerentur:  `ad devolvendum super nos, et ad conjiciendum se super nos' significat quod propter id sub potestatem absolutam redigerentur:  `et ad sumendum 
nos {1}in servos, et asinos nostros' significat usque ut quicquid in utroque naturali nihili sit:  `et accesserunt ad virum qui super domo Josephi' significat doctrinalia Ecclesiae:  `et locuti ad 
illum ostio domus' significat consultationem ex illis de introductione:  `et dixerunt, In me domine mi' significat testificationem:  `descendendo descendimus (x)in initio ad emendum cibum' significat 
animum comparandi bonum veris:  `et factum, cum veniremus ad diversorium, et aperuimus manticas nostras' significat introspectionem in naturale exterius:  `et ecce argentum cujusvis in ore manticae suae' 
significat quod perspectum, quod vera quasi gratis donata:  `argentum nostrum in pondere suo' significat vera secundum statum cujusvis:  `et reducimus illud in manu nostra' significat quod submittantur 
quae gratis donata quantum possibile:  `et argentum alterum descendere facimus in manu nostra ad emendum cibum' significat quod animus sit per verum aliunde comparare bonum:  `non scimus quis posuit 
argentum nostrum in manticis nostris' significat non fidem ex ignorantia a quo verum in naturali exteriore:  `et dixit, Pax vobis; ne timeatis'  significat quod bene sit, ne desperent:  `Deus vester 
et Deus patris vestri' significat Divinum Humanum Domini:  `dedit vobis absconditum donum in manticis vestris' significat quod ab Ipso absque ulla eorum prudentia:  `argentum vestrum venit ad me' 
significat quod videbitur sicut verum comparatum ab illis:  `et eduxit ad illos Shimeonem'  significat quod adjunxerit veris velle. @1 thus A I here and 5651; cp. above.$ </p>
