<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9730节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9730.</strong>“把网从下面安在坛的围腰底下”表在最末和最低层面的感官层。这从“一个格栅，一个网”、“围腰”和“下面”的含义清楚可知：要安在坛的围腰底下的“一个格栅，一个网”是指感官层，如前所述（<a href="9726.htm">9726</a>节）；“围腰”当论及感官层，是指最末和最低之物，外在感官层形成一个人生命的最末和最低层（参看<a href="9726.htm">9726</a>节）；“下面”是指外部，因为高层事物表示内层事物，低事物表示外层事物（<a href="6952.htm">6952</a>，<a href="6954.htm">6954</a>，<a href="7814.htm">7814</a>-<a href="7821.htm">7821</a>，<a href="8604.htm">8604</a>节），因此，“上面”或“向上”表示内部，“下面”或“向下”表示外部。外在感官层不是指身体感官本身，即它的视觉、听觉、味觉、嗅觉和触觉，而是指直接依赖于它们的能力。因为一个人若照着这些身体感官及其欲望思考和渴望，而不作进一步的考虑，就被称为感官人。他若进一步考虑并检查感官层渴望什么，感官层引着他思考什么，就被说成是被提升到感官层之上，或从感官层抽离出来，在一个更内在的层面上进行思考。如今那些处于仁和信的良善的人会遇到这种情况；当这种事发生时，感官层就处于休眠状态，丧失了它从世界及其事物那里所获得的活跃生命。构成一个人的理解力和意愿的事物能面向两个方向。一个面向外，朝向世界；一个面向内，朝向天堂。对属世和感官人来说，构成理解力和意愿，因而构成思维和情感的事物面向世界；但对属灵和属天的人来说，这些事物面向天堂，也交替面向世界。当一个人正在重生时，他会转向内部，并且他能朝那个方向转到什么程度，就能在何等程度上被主提升向天堂，到祂自己那里，由此能在同等程度上被赋予智慧、信和爱。因为那时，此人生活在内在人，因而生活在其灵的层面，外在人则从属于内在人。但是，如果一个人不允许自己重生，那么他的一切内层，也就是他里面的一切思维和情感仍面向世界；在这种情况下，他生活在外在人的层面，而内在人则从属于外在人。当外在人产生支持恶欲的推理时，这种情况就会发生。这些人被称为属世的，那些住在最外在事物里的人被称为感官的。由此可见当如何理解感官层。</p>

And thou shalt bestow it under the compass of the altar beneath. That hereby is signified this in ultimates, is evident from the signification of "the grating, a network" which was to be put under the 
compass of the altar, as being the sensuous (of which above, n. 9726); from the signification of "the compass," when said of the sensuous, as being the ultimate (that the external sensuous is the ultimate 
of life with man, see n. 9726); and from the signification of "beneath," as being outward, for by higher things are signified interior things, and by lower things are signified exterior ones (n. 
6952, 6954, 7814-7821, 8604); consequently by "above" or "upward" is signified inward; and by "beneath" or "downward" is signified outward. By the external sensuous is not meant the sense of the body 
itself, as its sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch, but that which is most nearly from these; for he is called a sensuous man who thinks and desires according to these senses of the body and their 
appetites, and considers no further. He who considers further, and examines what the sensuous desires, and what he himself thinks from the sensuous, is said to be raised above the sensuous, or to be 
withdrawn from it, and to think interiorly. This is the case with those at the present day who are in the good of charity and of faith. When this is done, the sensuous is quiescent, and is deprived 
of its active life which it has from the world and its objects. There are with man two determinations of the things of the understanding and of the will; one determination is outward toward the world, 
and the other is inward toward heaven. With natural and sensuous men, the determination of the things of the understanding and of the will, thus of the thoughts and affections, is toward the world; but 
with spiritual and celestial men the determination of these things is toward heaven, and also alternately toward the world. The hinge of the determinations turns inward when the man is being regenerated, 
and so far as it can then be turned inward, so far the man can be raised by the Lord toward heaven to Himself, and consequently be in the same proportion imbued with wisdom, faith, and love. For 
the man then lives in the internal man, consequently in his spirit, and the external man is subordinate thereto. But if a man does not suffer himself to be regenerated, then all his interiors remain 
determined toward the world, and then his life is in the external man, and the internal man is subordinate thereto. This is the case when the external man supplies reasonings which favor evil lusts. 
These men are called natural, and they who abide in things most external are called sensuous; from which it can be seen what is meant by "the sensuous." </p>

'And you shall put it under the rim of the altar beneath' means that sensory perception on the last and lowest levels. This is clear from the meaning of 'a grating, a network', which was to be put under 
the rim of the altar, as the level of sensory perception, dealt with above in <a href="9726.htm">9726</a>; from the meaning of 'the rim', when it refers to sensory perception, as that which is last and lowest (external 
sensory perception forms for a person the last and lowest level of life, see <a href="9726.htm">9726</a>); and from the meaning of 'beneath' as outwardly, for by things that are higher those which are more internal are meant, 
and by things that are lower those which are more external are meant, <a href="6952.htm">6952</a>, <a href="6954.htm">6954</a>, <a href="7814.htm">7814</a>-<a href="7821.htm">7821</a>, <a href="8604.htm">8604</a>, so that 'above' means inwardly and 'beneath' means outwardly. The words 'external sensory perception' 
are not used to mean the sensory powers of the body itself - its senses of sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch - but the ability that depends directly on them. For a person is called sensory-minded 
if those bodily senses and their appetites govern what he thinks and desires and he looks no further. If he does look further to examine what the senses desire and what his senses lead him to think, 
he is said to be raised above the sensory level, or to be drawn away from it, and to think on a more internal level. This happens to those at the present day who are governed by the good of charity 
and faith; and when it happens, the sensory level becomes dormant and is deprived of the life and activity that the world and worldly objects stimulate there.  There are two directions in which the 
things composing a person's understanding and will can be oriented. One faces without, towards the world; the other faces within, towards heaven. With natural and sensory-minded people the things composing 
their understanding and will, that is, their thoughts and affections, are oriented towards the world; but with spiritual and heavenly-minded people their thoughts and affections are oriented towards 
heaven, and also alternately towards the world. When a person is being regenerated he pivots round to face within, and so far as he can be turned in that direction the person can be raised by the 
Lord towards heaven, to Himself, and can as a result be endowed with wisdom, faith, and love. For the person then leads his life on the level of the internal man, consequently on that of his spirit, 
and the external man is subordinate to the internal. But if a person does not allow himself to be regenerated all the thoughts and affections within him remain oriented towards the world, in which case 
he leads his life on the level of the external man, and the internal man is subordinate to the external, as happens when the external man produces reasonings that lend support to evil desires. These 
people are called natural-minded, and those who are interested only in the most external things are called sensory-minded. All this goes to show what anyone should understand by the level of sensory 
perception.  </p>

`Et dabis illud sub ambitu altaris deorsum': quod significet hoc in ultimis, constat ex significatione `cribri operis retis, quod daretur sub ambitu altaris' quod sit sensuale, de qua supra n. 9726, 
ex significatione `ambitus' cum de sensuali, quod sit {1} ultimum; (m)quod sensuale externum sit ultimum vitae apud hominem, videatur n. 9726;(n) et ex significatione `deorsum' quod sit extrorsum {2}, 
nam per superiora significantur interiora, (c)et per inferiora exteriora, n. 6952, 6954, 7814-7821, 8604, inde per `sursum' significatur introrsum, et per `deorsum' extrorsum.  Per sensuale externum 
non intelligitur sensuale (o)ipsius corporis, sicut ejus {3} visus, auditus, gustus, olfactus {4}, tactus, sed quod est ex illis proxime {5}; nam sensualis homo dicitur qui cogitat et cupit secundum 
sensus illos corporis et eorum appetitus, et non expendit ulterius; qui expendit ulterius et explorat quid sensuale cupit, (o)et quid ipse ex sensuali cogitat, is dicitur elevari supra sensuale, aut subduci 
ab illo, ac cogitare interius; hoc fit apud illos hodie qui in bono charitatis et fidei sunt; cum hoc fit, quiescit sensuale, et orbatur sua vita activa, quam habet ex mundo et ejus objectis. 	[2] 
Sunt binae determinationes intellectualium et voluntariorum apud hominem; una determinatio est extrorsum versus mundum, et altera est introrsum versus caelum; apud naturales et sensuales homines 
est determinatio intellectualium et voluntariorum, ita cogitationum et affectionum, versus mundum, at apud spirituales et caelestes homines est determinatio illorum versus caelum, et quoque alternatim 
versus mundum; cardo determinationum vertitur introrsum cum homo regeneratur, et quantum (o)tunc is verti potest introrsum, tantum elevari potest homo a Domino versus caelum ad {6} Se, et inde tantum 
imbui sapientia, fide, et amore; nam homo tunc vivit in interno homine, proinde in suo spiritu, et externus homo ei subordinatus est; at si homo se non regenerari patitur, tunc omnia interiora ejus determinata 
versus mundum manent, et tunc vita ejus est in externo homine, et (x)internus ei subordinatus est, quod fit cum (o)hic ratiocinia faventia cupiditatibus malis suppeditat;(n) hi vocantur naturales 
homines, et qui in maxime externis sunt vocantur sensuales; inde constare potest quid intelligitur per sensuale. @1 i extremum et$ @2 i ab interioribus$ @3 d sicut ipse i quod est$ @4 odoratus$ @5
