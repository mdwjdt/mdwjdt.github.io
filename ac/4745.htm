<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4745节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4745.</strong>“他们坐下吃饭”表将出于虚假的邪恶归为己有。这从“吃”和“饭”的含义清楚可知：“吃”是指变成自己的，或归为己有（<a href="3168.htm">3168</a>，<a href="3513.htm">3513</a>，<a href="3596.htm">3596</a>，<a href="3832.htm">3832</a>节）；“饭”是指爱之良善（<a href="276.htm">276</a>，<a href="680.htm">680</a>，<a href="2165.htm">2165</a>，<a href="2177.htm">2177</a>，<a href="3464.htm">3464</a>，<a href="3478.htm">3478</a>，<a href="3735.htm">3735</a>，<a href="3813.htm">3813</a>，<a href="4211.htm">4211</a>，<a href="4217.htm">4217</a>，<a href="4735.htm">4735</a>节），以及总体上一切食物（参看<a href="2165.htm">2165</a>节）。然而，此处“饭”却表示反面，即邪恶，因为众所周知，那些领受圣餐时不配吃饼的人将邪恶，而非良善变成自己的，或归为己有。由此明显可知，就反面意义而言，“吃饭”表示将邪恶归为己有，或变成自己的。当古人作出一个重要决定，并得到其他人赞同时，他们习惯在一起吃饭，以此表示他们赞同这个决定，因而将它变成自己的；如以西结书：<br />看哪！以色列的首领各逞其膀臂，在你中间流人之血。在你中间有谗谤人、流人血的；有在山上吃过祭偶像之物的。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结22.6.htm">22:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结22.9.htm">9</a>）<br />此外，要知道，邪恶总体上有两个源头，一个是生活，一个是教义。源于虚假教义的邪恶被称为出于虚假的邪恶；此处所指的，就是这种邪恶。</p>

And they sat down to eat bread. That this signifies the appropriation of evil from falsity, is evident from the signification of "eating," as being appropriation (n. 3168, 3513, 3596, 3832); and from 
the signification of "bread," as being the good of love (n. 276, 680, 2165, 2177, 3464, 3478, 3735, 3813, 4211, 4217, 4735), and also in general all food (see n. 2165). Here however "bread" signifies 
the contrary, namely, evil; for it is known that they who eat the bread in the Holy Supper unworthily, do not appropriate good to themselves, but evil; whence it is evident that in the contrary sense 
by "eating bread" is signified the appropriation of evil. It was a custom among the ancients to eat together when they had made an important decision which was confirmed by the rest, by which they signified 
their approbation, and thus that they made it their own; as in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Behold, the princes of Israel, everyone according to his arm, have been in thee and have shed blood; men of calumny 
have been in thee to shed blood; and in thee they have eaten at the mountains (Luke 22:6, 9). Be it known further that there are in general two origins of evil, one from life, and the other from doctrine. 
The evil which is from the doctrine of falsity is called evil from falsity, and it is this evil which is here meant. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4745</b></p><p><b>4745.</b>
'And they sat down to eat bread' means making evil that was a product of falsity their own. This is clear from the meaning of 'eating' as making one's own, dealt with in <a href="3168.htm">3168</a>, <a href="3513.htm">3513</a> (end), <a href="3596.htm">3596</a>; <a href="3832.htm">3832</a>; 
and from the meaning of 'bread' as the good of love, dealt with in <a href="276.htm">276</a>, <a href="680.htm">680</a>, <a href="2165.htm">2165</a>, <a href="2177.htm">2177</a>, <a href="3464.htm">3464</a>, <a href="3478.htm">3478</a>, <a href="3735.htm">3735</a>, <a href="3813.htm">3813</a>, <a href="4211.htm">4211</a>, <a href="4217.htm">4217</a>, <a href="4735.htm">4735</a>, as well as all food in general, <a href="2165.htm">2165</a>. Here however 'bread' means the 
opposite of that good, namely evil, for it is well known that those who eat bread in the Holy Supper in an unworthy manner do not make good but evil their own. From this it is evident that in the contrary 
sense 'eating bread' means making evil their own. It was a practice among the ancients to eat together when they reached an important decision that was endorsed by everyone else. By eating together 
they were indicating that they approved the decision and so had made it their own, as in Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, the princes of Israel, each according to his power,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> have been among you and have shed 
blood. Men of intrigue have been among you, [ready] to shed blood, and have eaten on the mountains. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2022:6,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 22:6, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>What is more, it should be recognized that generally evil has two sources, the first 
being life and the second doctrine. That which has its origin in false doctrine is called evil that is a product of falsity; and it is this kind of evil that is meant here.

`Et sederunt ad comedendum panem': quod significet appropriationem mali ex falso, constat a significatione `comedere' quod sit appropriatio, de qua n. 3168, 3513 f, 3596, 3832; et ex significatione 
`panis' quod sit bonum amoris, de qua n. 276, 680, 2165, 2177, 3464, 3478, 3735, 3813, 4211, 4217, 4735; et quoque quod sit {1} in genere omnis cibus, n. 2165; hic autem `panis' significat contrarium, 
nempe malum; notum enim est quod qui indigne comedunt panem in Sacra Cena, non approprient sibi bonum sed malum; </p>
<p>inde patet quod per `comedere panem' in contrario sensu significetur appropriatio 
mali.  Apud antiquos in usu fuit, cum aliquid memorabile decreverunt, quod confirmatum a reliquis, quod tunc inter se comederint; per quod significabatur quod approbaverint et sic quod sibi appropriaverint 
illud, sicut apud Ezechielem,           Ecce principes Israelis, quisque juxta brachium suum,      fuerunt in te, et effuderunt sanguinem:  viri calumniae      fuerunt in te ad effundendum 
sanguinem, et ad montes      comederunt in te, xxii 6, 9. Praeterea sciendum quod binae origines mali sint in genere, una ex vita, et altera ex doctrina; quod ex doctrina falsi, vocatur malum ex 
falso; hoc malum hic intelligitur.      @1 fit I$ </p>
