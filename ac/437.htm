<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>437.</strong>“塞特”表一个新的信，仁由此而来，这可从他的名字看出来，它被赐予这名是因为，“神另给我立了一个后裔代替亚伯，因为该隐杀了他”。神“另立一个后裔”表主另赐一个信；因为“另一个后裔”就是信，仁由此而来。“后裔”表信，可查看255节。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]437.</strong> The symbolism here of Seth as a new faith that will allow charity to take hold is explained by his name, in that he was so called because God restored other seed in place of Abel, since Cain killed him. God restored other seed means that the Lord gave people another kind of faith. Other seed is a faith that allows for the growth of charity. For the symbolism of seed as faith, see above at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_437/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_255" target=_top>255</a>. </p>

That "Seth" here signifies a new faith, through which comes charity, is explained by his name, which it is said was given him because God "appointed another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew." That 
God "appointed another seed" means that the Lord gave another faith; for "another seed" is the faith through which comes charity. That "seed" signifies faith, may be seen above (n. 255). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 437</b></p><p><b>437.</b>
Here 'Seth' means new faith, by way of which comes charity. This is explained by his very name, which he received because 'God has appointed another seed in place of Abel, seeing that Cain had killed 
him'. 'God has appointed another seed' means that the Lord conferred another faith. 'Another seed' is faith by way of which charity may be received. That 'seed' means faith, see what has been stated 
already in <a href="255.htm">255</a>.

</p><b>437.</b>
Quod 'Sheth' significet hic novam fidem per quam charitas explicatur per nomen ejus, quod ita vocatum quia 'reposuit Deus semen aliud loco Habelis, quod occiderit eum Cain'; 'quod reposuerit Deus semen 
aliud' significat quod donaverit Dominus aliam fidem 'semen aliud' est fides per quam charitas; quod 'semen' significet fidem, videatur prius n. 255. </p>
