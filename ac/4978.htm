<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4978节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4978.</strong>“把一切所有的都交在约瑟手里”表属于这良善的一切似乎都服从与它相联的真理的权柄和掌控。这从“手”的含义清楚可知，“手”是指能力（<a href="878.htm">878</a>，<a href="3091.htm">3091</a>，<a href="3387.htm">3387</a>，<a href="3563.htm">3563</a>，<a href="4931.htm">4931</a>-<a href="4937.htm">4937</a>节）。因此，“交在约瑟手里”表置于它的权柄和掌控之下。然而，由于这只是所发生之事的表象，所以此处说“似乎服务它的权柄和掌控”。这只是表面上的，或似乎是这种情形（可参看<a href="4977.htm">4977</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4978</b></p><p><b>4978.</b>
And all that he had he gave into his hand. That this signifies that all that belonged to it was as it were in its power, is evident from the signification of the "hand," as being power (n. 878, 3091, 
3387, 3563, 4931-4937). Thus "to put into his hand" is to put into its power; but as this is done only apparently, it is said as it were in its power. (That it is only apparently, or as it were, may 
be seen just above, n. 4977.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4978</b></p><p><b>4978.</b>
'And whatever he had he gave into his hand' means that all that belonged to that good was seemingly subject to the power and control of its associated truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'whatever 
he had' as all that belonged to it, and from the meaning of 'hand' as power, dealt with in <a href="878.htm">878</a>, <a href="3091.htm">3091</a>, <a href="3787.htm">3787</a>, <a href="3563.htm">3563</a>, <a href="4931.htm">4931</a>-<a href="4937.htm">4937</a>. 'Giving into his hand' accordingly means placing under its power and control. 
Yet because this is only the appearance of what happens, the phrase 'seemingly subject to its power and control' is used. As regards its being what is apparently or seemingly the situation, see 
immediately above in <a href="4977.htm">4977</a>. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 4978</b>
</p><b>4978.</b>
`Et quicquid erat illi, dedit in manum ejus': quod significet quod omne suum sicut in ejus potestate, constat ex significatione `quicquid erat illi' quod sit omne suum; et ex significatione `manus' 
quod sit potentia, de qua n. 878, 3091, 3387, 3563, 4931-4937; ita `dare in manum ejus' est in potestatem ejus; sed quia hoc apparenter fit, dicitur sicut in ejus potestate; </p>
<p>quod sit apparenter 
seu sicut, videatur mox supra n. 4977. </p>
