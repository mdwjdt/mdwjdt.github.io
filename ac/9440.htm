<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9440节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9440.</strong>人若不知道天堂的奥秘，可能以为没有人能看见如此遥远的星球，并通过感官经历讲述它们。不过，要让他知道，就其第一因和起源而言，出现在灵界的空间、距离，以及由此而来的移动，是内层所经历的状态变化；在天使和灵人当中，表象与这些变化完全一致。通过这些变化，灵人和天使能从一个地方被送到另一个地方，从一个星球被送到另一个星球，甚至被送到位于宇宙边缘的星球。这种事也能向人的灵而行，而他的身体仍留在原处。这事也发生在我身上，因为蒙主的神性怜悯，我被允许作为一个灵人与灵人来往，同时作为一个世人与世人来往。在天堂，空间和距离，以及随之而来的移动是由内层的状态变化所产生的表象（参看<a href="5605.htm">5605</a>节）。感官人无法想象人的灵能以这种方式被运送，因为这种人住在时空里面，并照时空来衡量他的移动。</p>

He who is not acquainted with the arcana of heaven, may believe it to be impossible for a man to see earths which are so remote, and from the evidence of the senses to give any account of them. But he 
should know that in their first cause and origin, the spaces and distances, and consequently the progressions, which appear in the spiritual world, are changes of state of the interiors, and that they 
appear with angels and spirits in accordance with these changes; and that by means of such changes angels and spirits can be translated from one place to another, and from one earth to another, even 
to earths which are at the end of the universe. And so can a man in respect to his spirit, his body still remaining in its own place. So too has it been done with me, for of the Lord's Divine mercy 
it has been given me to be in company with spirits as a spirit, and at the same time with men as a man. (That in heaven the spaces and distances, and consequently the progressions, are appearances arising 
from changes of state of the interiors, see n. 5605.) A sensuous man cannot conceive that in respect to his spirit a man can be translated in this manner, because such a man is in space and in time, 
and measures his progressions according to these. </p>

A person unacquainted with the arcana of heaven may think that no one can see planets so far away and through what he has experienced with his senses report about them. But let it be recognized that 
intervals of space and distances between places, and consequent movements from one to another, which are visible in the natural world, are first occasioned by and have their origin in the changes of state 
undergone by the interiors, and that among angels and spirits appearances are in exact accord with those changes. In this way spirits and angels can be transported from one place to another, and 
from one planet to another, even to planets on the edge of the universe. The same thing can be done to a person's spirit while his body remains where it is. It has happened to me also, for I have been 
allowed in the Lord's Divine mercy to mix with spirits as a spirit, while at the same time mixing with people on earth as a person on earth. Regarding intervals of space and distances between places, 
and movements from one to another in heaven, that they are appearances which are products of changes of state undergone by the interiors, see <a href="5605.htm">5605</a>. The person who thinks on a sensory level does not see 
how anyone's spirit can be transported in that way, for he dwells within space and time and measures his movements from one place to another according to them.  </p>

Qui non scit arcana caeli credere potest quod homo non possit videre tellures tam dissitas, et per experientiam sensualem aliquid de illis referre; sed sciat quod spatia et distantiae, et inde progressiones, 
quae (x)apparent in mundo naturali, in sua prima causa et origine sint mutationes status interiorum, et quod apud angelos et spiritus secundum eas appareant; et quod illi sic per eas transferri 
possint ab uno loco in alterum, et ab una tellure {1}in alteram, etiam ad tellures quae in fine universi; similiter etiam homo quoad suum spiritum, manente usque corpore ejus in suo loco; ita mecum 
etiam factum est, quoniam, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, mihi datum est conversari cum spiritibus sicut (x)spiritus, et simul cum hominibus sicut homo.  Quod spatia et distantiae, et inde progressiones 
in caelo sint apparentiae ex mutationibus status interiorum, videatur n. (x)5605. Quod homo quoad spiritum {2} ita transferri possit, sensualis homo non capere potest, quoniam is in spatio et in 
tempore est, et progressiones suas secundum illa mensurat. @1 ad$ @2 i suum$ </p>
