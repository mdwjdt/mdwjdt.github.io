<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2129节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2129.</strong>吵闹，确切地说冲突还有其它种类，它们也传达了最后审判的概念，并且就其内在而言，凭它们邪恶集结起来的社群会被解散。对此，我讲述如下内容：这类灵人被驱使进入一种状态，在这种状态下，他们不像平常那样在社群内思考，而是各自独立思考。由于他们的想法彼此都不一致，每个人所嘟囔的事都不同于其他人的。结果，一种喧嚣就产生了，它听上去就像众水的喧嚣，并且彼此间所发生的冲突无法描述；这些冲突都是由于对既定真理，也就是当时他们思想和谈论的主题意见混乱而造成的。诸如此类的混乱可称作属灵的混乱。<br />这些冲突和混乱的咆哮声有三重。第一重声音在脑袋周围流入，我被告知，那是思维的声音。第二重声音朝左太阳穴流入，我被告知，那是对他们所不愿信仰的某些真理进行推理的冲突。第三重声音则从右上方流入，那是咬牙切齿的声音，但不那么混乱。这种咬牙切齿声先是对准这个方向，然后又对准那个方向。我被告知，这是因为正以这种方式被转向这个方向的真理和通过他们进行推理的真理互相碰撞。当这些冲突还在继续时，那里与我说话的其他灵人告诉我每一个事物的含义，他们的话越过所有这些嗓音清晰地穿透过来。<br />他们所推理的问题主要是这些：照字面的理解，十二使徒是否会坐在十二个宝座上审判以色列十二个支派；还有，经历迫害和苦难的其他人是否可以进入天堂。每个人都照着他活在肉身时所陷入的幻觉进行推理。不过，其中一些人曾被带回团契和秩序中，后来得到指教：关于使徒的这句经文要以完全不同的方式来理解，也就是说，“使徒”并非指使徒，“宝座”并非指宝座，“支派”并非指支派，事实上，“十二”也不是指十二。相反，所有这些术语，即“使徒”、“宝座”、“支派”，以及“十二”均表示信的最初和最重要的事物（参看<a href="2089.htm">2089</a>节）。他们还说，信的这类事物是每个人被审判的起点和标准；还进一步说明，使徒们根本没有权力审判任何人，一切审判唯独属于主。<br />关于他们所推理的另外一个问题，这个问题也不应理解为只有那些遭受迫害和苦难的人才会进天堂；而要理解为富人和穷人一样会进天堂；身居高位者和地位低下者也一样会进天堂。而且，主怜悯所有人，尤其怜悯那些遭受属灵的苦难和试探，就是被罪恶迫害之人，因而怜悯那些承认他们凭自己是悲惨的，相信唯独通过主的怜悯他们才能得救之人。</p>

There are likewise other kinds of tumults, or rather of conflicts, which also present the idea of a Last Judgment, and by which societies that have been evilly combined in respect to their interiors 
are dissolved, concerning which I may relate what follows. Such spirits are driven into a state in which they do not think in society or communion in the usual way, but each one for himself. From their 
thoughts thus at variance, and the confused sound of their jarring speech, an uproar is heard, as of many waters, and a conflict among them, such as cannot be described, that arises from the confusion 
of opinions concerning fixed and certain truths which are then the subjects of their thoughts and speech, and which uproar is of such a character that it may be called a spiritual chaos.  [2] The 
sound of the conflicting and confused roarings was threefold. One sound flowed in around the head, and was said to be that of the thoughts. Another sound flowed in toward the left temple, and was said 
to be the conflict of their reasonings about certain truths in which they were not willing to have faith. The third sound flowed in from above at the right, and was a gnashing one, but not so confused, 
and the gnashing was turned this way and that, and it was said that this was because the truths that were being turned in this manner this way and that by their reasonings, were in conflict. While 
these conflicts were going on there were other spirits besides who spoke to me and told me what each thing signified, and their speech penetrated distinctly through those sounds.  [3] The subjects of 
the reasonings were especially these: whether it is to be understood according to the letter that the twelve apostles are to sit upon twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel; also, whether 
any others are to be admitted into heaven than those who have suffered persecutions and miseries. Each one reasoned according to his phantasy, which he had caught in the life of the body. But some 
of them who had been brought back into communion and order, were afterwards instructed that the statement concerning the apostles is to be understood in an entirely different manner; namely, by the "apostles" 
are not meant apostles, nor by "thrones," thrones, nor by "tribes," tribes, nor in fact by "twelve," twelve; but by all these terms-"apostles," "thrones," "tribes," and also by "twelve," are 
signified the primary things of faith (see n. 2089); and it is from these and according to them that judgment is effected upon everyone. It was further shown that the apostles cannot judge even one man, 
but that all judgment is of the Lord alone.  [4] And as regards the other subject of reasoning, neither is this to be understood as meaning that those only are to come into heaven who have suffered 
persecutions and miseries; but that the rich will enter heaven just as much as the poor, those posted in dignity just as much as those in low condition; and that the Lord has mercy on all, especially 
on those who have been in spiritual miseries and temptations, which are persecutions by the evil-thus on those who acknowledge that of themselves they are wretched, and who believe that it is solely 
of the Lord's mercy that they are saved. </p>

There are also other types of tumults, or rather of conflicts, which also convey the idea of a Last Judgement and by which communities harmfully joined together as regards their interiors are dissolved. 
Concerning them let the following be mentioned: Such spirits are driven into a condition in which they do not think in their normal way as a community, that is, one with another, but each one independently. 
As a result of their thinking, each at variance with the others, and of each muttering something different from the rest, an uproar is produced which sounds like that of many waters; and conflict 
with one another takes place such as defies description which arises out of the mishmash of opinions concerning firmly established truths, which are at the time the substance of their thoughts 
and speech. That mishmash is such as may be called spiritual chaos. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The sound of these conflicting and confused uproarings was threefold. The first flowed in around the head, and I was told it 
was that of thoughts. The second flowed in towards the left temple. I was told that this was a conflict of reasonings about certain truths in which they were unwilling to pin their faith. The third flowed 
in from above over on the right. It was rasping though less confused, a rasping sound directed first this way, then that. I was told that this was the product of truths clashing which were being 
turned this way and that by means of reasonings. While these conflicts were going on there were other spirits who spoke to me, telling me in speech that rose clearly above all that noise the meaning of 
every single thing. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The matters which they reasoned about were chiefly these - whether the statement that the twelve apostles were going to sit on twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of 
Israel was to be understood literally, and also whether other people who have endured persecution and affliction were to be allowed into heaven. Each one reasoned in accordance with what had taken his 
fancy during his lifetime. Some of them however who had been brought back into associations with one another and into order were then informed that those descriptions were to be understood in a completely 
different way, that is to say, that 'apostles' is not used to mean apostles, nor 'thrones' to mean thrones, nor 'tribes' tribes, nor indeed is 'twelve' used to mean twelve. Instead apostles, thrones, 
tribes, and also twelve, meant the first and foremost matters of faith, <a href="2089.htm">2089</a>. They also said that such matters of faith are the starting- point and the criteria from which everyone is judged. 
And over and above all this they were shown that the apostles have no power to judge anyone at all, and that all judgement is the Lord's alone. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 As regards the second point which they reasoned about, 
this should not be taken to mean that only those who have endured persecution and affliction will enter heaven, but that the rich no less than the poor will do so, those who have held important 
positions no less than those whose position has been humble. Furthermore the Lord takes pity on all, especially on people who have endured spiritual afflictions and temptations, which are persecutions 
by the evil, thus on those who acknowledge that of themselves they are wretched and who believe that it is through the Lord's mercy alone they are saved. </p>

Sunt alia genera quoque tumultuum seu potius conflictuum, quae ideam quoque ultimi judicii sistunt, et quibus societates male conjunctae quoad interiora dissolvuntur; de quibus haec licet memorare: 
adiguntur spiritus tales in illum statum ut non ut solitum {1}, in societate seu communione cogitent, sed quilibet pro se; ex variantibus sic cogitationibus, et murmurantibus diversimode loquelis, quidam 
strepitus auditus quasi multarum aquarum, et inter eas conflictus, qualis describi nequit, oriundus ex confusione opinionum de certis veritatibus, quae tunc sunt objecta cogitationum et loquelae, 
qui talis est ut vocari possit chaos spirituale.  [2] Sonus murmurum confligentium ei confusorum erat triplex; unus influebat circum caput, et dictum quod is esset cogitationum; alter influebat versus 
sinistrum tempus; dictum quod hic esset conflictio ratiocinationum de veritatibus quibusdam quibus fidem habere non vellent; tertius influebat desuper ad dextrum, qui erat stridens non ita confusus, 
qui stridor versabatur cis et retro; dictum quod inde hoc, quod pugnarent veritates quae ita cis et retro per ratiocinia(6) versarentur: cum hi conflictus perstabant, erant usque spiritus qui mecum loquebantur, 
dicentes quid singula significarent, loquela eorum per sonitus illos distincte penetrante.  [3] Objecta ratiocinationum eorum erant cumprimis haec, num secundum litteram intelligendum quod 
duodecim apostoli sederent super duodecim thronis et judicarent duodecim tribus Israelis: tum etiam, num alii in caelum admittendi quam qui persecutiones et miserias passi sunt; quisque secundum suam 
phantasiam quam in vita corporis aucupavit, ratiocinabatur: sed quidam eorum qui in communionem et in ordinem redacti sunt, postea instruebantur quod aliter prorsus intelligendum, nempe quod per `apostolos' 
non intellecti sint apostoli, nec per `thronos' throni, nec per `tribus' tribus, immo nec duodecim per `duodecim,' sed per illos, tam apostolos, quam thronos, et tribus, ut et per duodecim significata 
primaria {3} fidei, (o). 2089, et quod ex his et secundum haec judicium super unumquemvis fiat; et insuper ostensum quod apostoli ne quidem unum hominem judicare possint, sed quod omne judicium 
sit solius Domini.  [4] Et quoad alterum, hoc nec ita intelligendum quod solum illi venturi in caelum qui persecutiones et miserias passi, sed quod aeque divites ac pauperes, aeque in dignitate constituti 
ac qui in vili conditione sunt, et quod Dominus misereatur omnium, imprimis qui in miseriis spiritualibus et tentationibus, quae sunt persecutiones a malis, fuerunt; ita qui agnoscunt se ex se 
miseros esse et credunt solius misericordiae Domini esse quod salventur. 	@1 i est.$ 	@2 per ratiocinia before ita.$ 	@3 i sint.$ 	@4 queant.$ </p>
