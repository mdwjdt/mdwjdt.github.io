<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5700节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5700.</strong>“也为和约瑟同吃饭的埃及人单摆了一席”表处于颠倒次序的记忆知识的分离。这从“埃及人”的代表和“和约瑟同吃饭的单摆”的含义清楚可知：“埃及人”是指处于颠倒次序的记忆知识，如下文所述；“和约瑟同吃饭的单摆”是指分离，如刚才所述（<a href="5699.htm">5699</a>节）。“和约瑟同吃饭的埃及人”是指在约瑟家里吃饭的埃及人；显然，他们并未和约瑟同吃饭，因为他们是单独吃的。“埃及”或“埃及人”在正面意义上表示教会的记忆知识（参看<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>，<a href="4749.htm">4749</a>，<a href="4964.htm">4964</a>，<a href="4966.htm">4966</a>节）；但在反面意义上则表示处于颠倒次序的记忆知识，因而表示违背教会真理的观念（<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>节）。反面意义上的“埃及”在圣言的许多地方被提及。“埃及”之所以表示这些记忆知识，是因为古教会的记忆知识都是属天和属灵事物的代表和有意义的符号，在埃及人中间的发展胜过在其他人当中的，但这些记忆知识却被他们转变为巫术。因此，他们完全颠倒了代表性教会的记忆知识。<br />当人们滥用天上的次序行恶时，就说记忆知识处于颠倒的次序；因为天上的次序是向所有人行善。因此，这样做的结果是，人们一旦以这种方式颠倒天上的次序，最终会弃绝神性事物，天堂的事物，进而弃绝仁与信的事物。变成这样的人知道如何利用记忆知识去敏锐和娴熟地进行推理，因为他们出于感官经验进行推理，出于感官经验进行推理，就是出于外在事物，即诸如属于身体和世界的那类事物进行推理，这些事物会直接抓住人的思维和感觉。除非这类事物或这类事实知识被天堂之光光照，由此被带入完全相反的次序，或说以完全相反的次序被排列，否则它们就会使此人在天堂的事上陷入如此大的模糊，以致他不仅不理解它们，甚至完全不肯接受它们，最终抛弃它们，然后尽可能地亵渎它们。当记忆知识处于适当次序时，它们就会被主排列为天堂的形式。但是，当它们处于颠倒次序时，它们就会被排列为地狱的次序，然后最虚假的事物在中心，支持它们的事物在周边，而真理却在外面。这些真理因在外面，故无法与以真理为主导的天堂进行任何交流。于是，内层事物向这种人关闭，因为通往天堂的道路通过内层事物敞开。</p>

And for the Egyptians, who did eat with him, alone. That this signifies the separation of the memory-knowledges which are in inverted order, is evident from the representation of the Egyptians, as being 
memory-knowledges that are in inverted order (of which hereafter); and from the signification of "who did eat with him alone," as being separation (as just above, n. 5699). By the Egyptians "who did 
eat with him" are meant the Egyptians who ate at Joseph's house; that they did not eat with Joseph is plain, because they ate alone. By "Egypt" or the "Egyptians" in a good sense are signified the 
memory-knowledges of the church (see n. 1462, 4749, 4964, 4966); but in the opposite sense are signified the memory-knowledges which are in inverted order, thus which are contrary to the truths of the 
church (n. 1164, 1165, 1186). In this sense "Egypt" is mentioned in many passages of the Word. That "Egypt" signifies these memory-knowledges, is because the memory- knowledges of the Ancient Church, 
which were representative and significative of celestial and spiritual things, and which were cultivated among the Egyptians more than among others, were turned by them into magic; whereby they completely 
inverted the memory-knowledges of the representative church. [2] Memory-knowledges are said to be in inverted order when men abuse heavenly order to do evil; for heavenly order is that good be 
done to all. Hence it comes to pass that when they have thus inverted heavenly order, they at last deny Divine things, the things of heaven, and consequently those of charity and faith. They who become 
such know how to reason acutely and skillfully from memory-knowledges, because they reason from the senses, and to reason from these is to reason from such things as are external, that is, from such 
as are of the body and the world, which take direct hold of man's senses and feelings. Unless such things have been illumined by the light of heaven, and thereby arranged in an entirely different order, 
they put the man in so great an obscurity as to heavenly things that he not only comprehends none of them, but even wholly denies, and at last rejects them, and then as far as he may, blasphemes them. 
When memory-knowledges are in order, they are arranged by the Lord in the form of heaven; but when they are in inverted order, they are arranged in the form of hell, and then things most false are 
in the midst, and those which confirm them are at the sides, while truths are without, and because they are without they can have no communication with heaven where truths reign; and therefore interior 
things are closed to such persons; for heaven is open by means of things interior. </p>

'And for the Egyptians eating with him by themselves' means the separation of factual knowledge existing in an inverted state of order. This is clear from the representation of 'the Egyptians' as factual 
knowledge present in an inverted state of order, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'eating with him by themselves' as a separation, dealt with immediately above in <a href="5699.htm">5699</a>. 'The Egyptians eating 
with him' means Egyptians who were eating at Joseph's house; yet it is evident that they did not do so with Joseph since it says that they ate 'by themselves'. In the good sense facts known to the 
Church are meant by 'Egypt' or 'the Egyptians', see <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>, <a href="4749.htm">4749</a>, <a href="4964.htm">4964</a>, <a href="4966.htm">4966</a>; but in the contrary sense facts existing in an inverted state of order, and so ideas contrary to the truths known to the Church 
are meant by them, <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>. And many places in the Word contain some reference to Egypt in this contrary sense. The reason why 'Egypt' means those facts existing in an inverted state of 
order is that the facts known to the Ancient Church which were the representatives and meaningful signs of celestial and spiritual realities, and which were fostered among those people more than others, 
were converted by them into magic. Consequently the facts known to the representative Church were brought by them into a completely inverted state of order. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Facts are said to exist in an inverted 
state of order when people intent on doing what is evil violate heavenly order; for heavenly order intends that good should be done to everyone. The result of this therefore is that once people 
cause heavenly order to become inverted in this way they ultimately reject what is of God, what is of heaven, and consequently what constitutes charity and faith. People who have come to be like this 
know how to use factual knowledge to engage in keen and skillful reasoning; for their use of reason relies on sensory evidence, and reasoning reliant on sensory evidence relies on considerations of an 
external nature - on bodily and worldly matters which instantly absorb a person's thoughts and feelings. Unless such factual knowledge has had the light of heaven shed upon it and has thereby been brought 
into a completely different state of order, it sets the person in obscurity. This obscurity is so pronounced, so far as heavenly matters are concerned, that he not only fails to understand them 
but also utterly refuses to accept them, and at length casts them aside and, so far as he is allowed to do so, says blasphemous things about them. When factual knowledge exists in a proper state of order 
it has been arranged by the Lord into the same form as heaven takes. But when it exists in an inverted state of order it has been arranged into the form hell takes, a form in which the worst falsities 
are in the centre, supporting ideas come next, and truths on the outside. And as those truths are on the outside they cannot have any communication with heaven where truths are predominant. For 
this reason the interiors are closed, since it is through those interiors that the way to heaven lies open. </p>

`Et Aegyptiis comedentibus cum eo solis':  quod significet separationem scientificorum quae in inverso ordine, constat ex repraesentatione `Aegyptiorum' quod sint scientifica quae in inverso ordine, 
de qua sequitur; et a significatione `comedentibus cum eo solis' quod sit separatio, ut mox supra n. 5699.  Per `Aegyptios comedentes cum eo' intelliguntur Aegyptii qui comedebant apud Josephum; quod 
non cum Josepho comederent, patet, quia comedebant soli.  Per `Aegyptum' seu per `Aegyptios' in bono sensu significantur scientifica Ecclesiae, videatur n. 1462, 4749, 4964, 4966, at in opposito sensu 
per illos significantur scientifica quae in inverso ordine sunt, ita quae sunt contra vera Ecclesiae, n. 1164, 1165, 1186, in hoc sensu memoratur Aegyptus pluribus in locis in Verbo; quod Aegyptus illa 
scientifica significet, est quia scientifica Ecclesiae Antiquae, quae fuerunt repraesentativa et significativa caelestium et spiritualium quae apud illos plus quam apud alios exculta fuerunt, verterant 
in magica, inde scientifica {1}Ecclesiae repraesentativae prorsus inverterunt; [2]in inverso ordine dicuntur esse scientifica, quando {2}abutuntur ordine caelesti ad faciendum malum, ordo enim caelestis 
(x)est ut bonum fiat omnibus; inde fit cum inverterint ita ordinem caelestem, quod demum negent Divina, illa quae caeli, consequenter quae charitatis et fidei sunt, {3}qui tales facti sunt, sciunt 
ex scientificis acriter et solerter ratiocinari, quia ratiocinantur ex sensualibus, et ratiocinari ex sensualibus, est ex talibus quae externa sunt, {4}nempe quae corporis et mundi, quae immediate 
occupant sensus et animos hominis; talia nisi illuminata fuerint a luce caeli, et sic in prorsus alium ordinem disposita, in tali obscuro {5}ponunt hominem quoad caelestia, ut non solum nihil eorum{6} 
capiat, sed etiam prorsus {6}neget, et tandem {6}rejiciat, ac tunc quantum licet, blasphemet; scientifica cum in ordine sunt, disposita sunt a Domino {7}in formam caeli; at cum scientifica {8}in inverso 
ordine sunt, disposita sunt in formam inferni, et {9} tunc falsissima in medio sunt, et quae illa confirmant ad latera, at vera sunt extra {10} et quia extra sunt, non communicationem habere possunt 
cum caelo, ubi vera regnant; quapropter {11} illis clausa sunt interiora, nam per interiora patet caelum. @1 apud illos fuerunt in prorsus inverso ordine$ @2 sunt prout apud illos qui negant Divina
