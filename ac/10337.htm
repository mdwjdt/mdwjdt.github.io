<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10337节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10337</strong>.“他们要作我所吩咐你的一切”表源于圣言的神性真理，这些真理将在外在物体中被代表。这从“作我所吩咐的一切”的含义和“摩西”的代表清楚可知：“作我所吩咐的一切”当论及主时，是指照神性真理如此行，因为神性真理被称为主的诫命（参看<a href="9417.htm">9417</a>节）；“摩西”是指圣言（<a href="9372.htm">9372</a>节）。它之所以表示它们将在外在物体中被代表，是因为他们将要作的事物是有代表性的，代表性的物体是外在事物，内在事物呈现在这些事物里面，如同呈现在类型或形象中。他们所要作的代表性物体在接下来的经文（3 1:7-11）中被列出来。至于何为代表，可参看<a href="9280.htm">9280</a>节提到的地方，以及<a href="9457.htm">9457</a>， <a href="9481.htm">9481</a>， <a href="9576.htm">9576</a>， <a href="9577.htm">9577</a>， <a href="10149.htm">10149</a>， <a href="10252.htm">10252</a>， <a href="10276.htm">10276</a>节。</p>

And they shall make all that I have commanded thee. That this signifies Divine truths from the Word that were to be represented in outward things, is evident from the signification of "making all that 
I have commanded," when said with respect to the Lord, as being according to Divine truths, for Divine truths are called the commandments of the Lord (see n. 9417); and from the representation of Moses, 
as being the Word (n. 9372). That it denotes that were to be represented in outward things, is because the things which they were about to make were representative, and things representative are 
outward things in which as in types internal things are presented to view. The representatives which they were to make are enumerated in verses 7 to 11, which follow. (What representatives are may be 
seen at the places cited in n. 9280, also n. 9457, 9481, 9576, 9577, 10149, 10252, 10276.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10337</b></p><p><b>10337.</b>
'And they shall make all the things that I have commanded you' means Divine Truths derived from the Word, which are to be represented within outward objects. This is clear from the meaning of 'making 
all the things that I have commanded', when it relates to the Lord, as doing so in accordance with Divine Truths, for Divine Truths are called the commandments of the Lord, <a href="9417.htm">9417</a>; and from the representation 
of 'Moses' as the Word, dealt with in <a href="9372.htm">9372</a>. The reason why it means that they were to be represented within outward objects was that the things they were to make were representative, and representative 
objects are outward things within which, as types or images, inner realities are presented. The representative objects which they were to make are listed in verses 7-11 that follow. What representatives 
are, see in the places referred to in <a href="9280.htm">9280</a>, also <a href="9457.htm">9457</a>, <a href="9481.htm">9481</a>, <a href="9576.htm">9576</a>, <a href="9577.htm">9577</a>, <a href="10149.htm">10149</a>, <a href="10252.htm">10252</a>, <a href="10276.htm">10276</a>.  </p>

`Et facient omnia quae praecepi tibi': quod significet Divina Vera quae ex Verbo, quae in externis repraesentanda, constat ex significatione `facere omnia quae praecepi' cum de Domino, quod sit secundum
