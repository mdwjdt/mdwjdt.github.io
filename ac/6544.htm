Verses 12, 13. And his sons did unto him as he had commanded them; and his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the 
field for a possession of a sepulcher from Ephron the Hittite, upon the faces of Mamre. "And his sons did unto him as he had commanded them," signifies the effect according to the influx; "and his sons 
carried him to the land of Canaan," signifies that the church was transferred thither; "and buried him" signifies resuscitation there; "in the cave of the field of Machpelah," signifies the beginning 
of regeneration; "which Abraham bought with the field," signifies those whom the Lord had redeemed; "for a possession of a sepulcher, from Ephron the Hittite," signifies those who receive the truth 
and good of faith, and suffer themselves to be regenerated; "upon the faces of Mamre," signifies the quality and the quantity. </p>

Verses 12,13 And his sons did for him thus, as he had commanded them. And his sons carried him to the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham had bought with 
the field as a possession for a grave, from Ephron the Hittite - facing Mamre. </p>

carried him to the land of Canaan' means that the Church was transferred to that place. 'And buried him' means restoration to life there. 'In the cave of the field of Machpelah' means the beginning 
of regeneration. 'Which Abraham had bought with the field' means those whom the Lord had redeemed. 'As a possession for a grave, from Ephron the Hittite' means those who receive the truth and good of 
faith and allow themselves to be regenerated. 'Facing Mamre' means nature and extent. </p>

Vers. 12, 13.  Et fecerunt filii ejus ita, quemadmodum praeceperat illis.  Et tulerunt illum filii ejus terram Canaanem, et sepeliverunt illum in spelunca agri Machpelah, quam emerat Abraham cum agro 
ad possessionem sepulcri ex Ephrone Hittaeo, super facies Mamre.  `Et fecerunt filii ejus ita, quemadmodum praeceperat illis' significat effectum secundum influxum: `et tulerunt illum filii ejus terram 
Canaanem' significat quod Ecclesia illuc translata: `et sepeliverunt illum' significat resuscitationem ibi: `in spelunca agri Machpelah' significat regenerationis principium:  `quam emerat Abraham 
cum agro' significat quos redemerat Dominus:  `ad possessionem sepulcri ex Ephrone Hittaeo' significat illos qui verum et bonum fidei recipiunt, et se regenerari patiuntur: `super facies Mamre' significat
