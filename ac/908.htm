<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>908.</strong>“和你在一起凡有血肉的一切野兽”表该教会成员里面活过来的一切。这一点从以下事实清楚可知，即“野兽”论及挪亚，就是现已重生的该教会成员，显然也论及接下来的事物，即“飞鸟、牲畜和爬行物”，因为经上说“和你在一起凡有血肉的一切野兽，就是飞鸟、牲畜和一切爬在地上的爬行物”。在原文中，用于“野兽”的这个词严格来说表生命或活物；但在圣言中，它既用来表活物，也用来表某种意义上并非活着的事物，或野兽。所以，人若不通晓圣言的内义，有时就不明白什么意思。这个词具有双重含义的原因在于，上古教会成员在主面前谦卑地承认自己不是活的，甚至不如家畜，不过是个野兽。因为他知道，人在专注于自己，或处于自我中心时就是这样。所以，这同一个词既表活物，也表野兽。<br />至于它表活物，明显可见于诗篇：<br />你的野兽要住在其中（神的子民）；神啊，你必以你的良善使穷乏人强健。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗68.10.htm">68:10</a>）<br />此处，由于他要住在神的子民中，故“野兽”无非表重生的人，因而如此处的情形，即它表他里面的活物。<br />因为森林中的一切野兽是我的，千山上的牲畜也是我的；山中的飞鸟，我都知道；田野的野兽与我同在。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗50.10.htm">50:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗50.11.htm">11</a>）<br />此处，“田野的野兽与我同在”，即与神同在，表重生之人，因而表他里面的活物。以西结书：<br />空中的所有飞鸟都在枝子上搭窝，田野的一切野兽都在枝条下生产。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结31.6.htm">31:6</a>） <br />当那日，我必与田野的野兽和空中的飞鸟立约。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何2.18.htm">2:18</a>）<br />这论及即将重生之人，要与他立约。事实上，“野兽”完全表“活物”，以致以西结所看到的基路伯或天使被称为“四个活物”或“活物（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结1.5.htm">1:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结1.13.htm">13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结1.15.htm">15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结1.19.htm">19</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结10.15.htm">10:15</a>）。<br />在圣言中，“野兽”在相反意义上则表非活物，或凶猛的野兽，这一点从大量经文清楚可知。仅引用以下经文证实这一点。诗篇：<br />不要将你斑鸠的灵魂交给野兽。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗74.19.htm">74:19</a>）<br />西番雅书：<br />这城何竟荒凉，成为野兽躺卧之处。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番2.15.htm">2:15</a>）<br />以西结书：<br />他们必不再作外邦人的掠物，地上的野兽也不再吞吃他们。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结34.28.htm">34:28</a>）<br /><br />空中的飞鸟都要宿在他的废墟上；田野的一切野兽都要卧在它的枝条下。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结31.13.htm">31:13</a>）<br />何西阿书：<br />在那里我必像狮子吞吃他们，田野的野兽必撕裂他们。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何13.8.htm">13:8</a>）<br />以西结书：<br />我已将你给地上野兽、空中飞鸟作食物。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结29.5.htm">29:5</a>）<br />这种用法很常见。而且，由于犹太人只局限于字义，将“野兽”理解为一头野兽，将“飞鸟”理解为一只飞鸟，所以他们并不知道圣言的内在事物，也不愿承认它们，从而接受指教。事实上，他们本身是如此残忍和野蛮的动物，以致他们不是以埋葬在战场所杀戮的敌人为乐，而是以将他们暴尸荒野，任飞禽和野兽吞吃为乐。这也表明何为野兽人。</p>

Cooper(2008,2013)</b></p>
<p><strong>[NCE]908.</strong> The symbolism of every wild animal that is with you, of all flesh, as everything that was alive in the people of this church can be seen from this: The wild animal refers to a quality in Noah, or in other words, in the people of this church, now that they had regenerated. And it plainly looks ahead to the bird, beast, and creeping thing, since it says, "every wild animal that is with you, of all flesh, including the bird and the beast and every creeping thing creeping on the earth."<br />The word for wild animal in the original language strictly means life or a living thing, yet in the Word it means not only a living thing but also a relatively nonliving thing: a wild animal.{*1} (You can see why those who do not grasp the Word's inner sense will sometimes be at a loss as to its meaning.) The reason the word means both living and nonliving is that the people of the earliest church, in humbling themselves before the Lord, confessed that they were nonliving, were not even good animals but wild beasts. They knew intimately that this is what humans are, viewed in themselves or as independent creatures. So the same word means both a living thing and a wild animal.<br />[2] The meaning of a wild animal as a living thing is evident in David:<br />Your wild animal will live in it [God's inheritance].{*2} You will strengthen the wretched person with your goodness, God. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_908/bible_king-james-version_psalms_68_9-10" target=_top>Psalms 68:9-10</a>)<br />The wild animal, because it will live in God's inheritance, simply means a regenerate person and consequently, as here, a living quality in such a person. In the same author:<br />Every wild animal of the forest is mine, the beasts on mountains of thousands. I know every bird of the mountains, and the wild animal of my field is with me. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_908/bible_king-james-version_psalms_50_10-11" target=_top>Psalms 50:10-11</a>)<br />The wild animal of the field "with me," that is, with God, also{*3} stands for a regenerate person and so for the living qualities in that person. In Ezekiel:<br />In its branches nested every bird of the heavens, and under its branches bred every wild animal of the field. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_908/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_31_6" target=_top>Ezekiel 31:6</a>)<br />This passage describes the spiritual church as a plant, so the phrase stands for the living qualities in the people of that church. In Hosea:<br />I will strike a pact on that day with the wild animal of the field and with the bird in the heavens. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_908/bible_king-james-version_hosea_2_18" target=_top>Hosea 2:18</a>)<br />This is about people regenerating, with whom a pact will be struck. So strong is the meaning of a wild animal as a living thing that even the guardian beings or angels seen by Ezekiel are called four "wild animals" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_908/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_1_5" target=_top>Ezekiel 1:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_908/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_1_13-14" target=_top>13-14</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_908/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_1_15" target=_top>15</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_908/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_1_19" target=_top>19</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_908/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_10_15" target=_top>10:15</a>).<br />[3] The fact that a wild animal in the Word is taken in the opposite sense of a nonliving thing, or a savage creature, can be seen in many places. Let these alone serve for proof. In David:<br />Do not hand the soul of your turtledove over to the wild animal. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_908/bible_king-james-version_psalms_74_19" target=_top>Psalms 74:19</a>)<br />In Zephaniah:<br />The city became a wasteland, a lair for the wild animal. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_908/bible_king-james-version_zephaniah_2_15" target=_top>Zephaniah 2:15</a>)<br />In Ezekiel:<br />They will no longer be plunder for the nations, and the wild animal of the land will not eat them. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_908/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_34_28" target=_top>Ezekiel 34:28</a>)<br />In the same author:<br />On its wreckage will live every bird of the heavens, and among its branches will stand every wild animal of the field. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_908/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_31_13" target=_top>Ezekiel 31:13</a>)<br />In Hosea:<br />I will devour them there like a lion; the wild animal of the field will rip them apart. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_908/bible_king-james-version_hosea_13_8" target=_top>Hosea 13:8</a>)<br />In Ezekiel:<br />... given to the wild animal of the land and to the bird in the heavens as food ... (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_908/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_29_5" target=_top>Ezekiel 29:5</a>)<br />This phrase recurs often.{*4} The Jews stuck exclusively to the literal meaning, understanding a wild animal as a wild animal and a bird as a bird, unwilling to see (much less acknowledge) any deeper content in the Word or to learn about it. As a result, they were so cruel, so feral, that they found pleasure in refusing to bury enemies killed in battle, leaving the bodies out to be eaten by the birds and wild animals.{*5} This also demonstrates clearly what a wild animal a human being is.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For the Hebrew word in question, see note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_908/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_774" target=_top>774</a>. [RS]<br />{*2} The bracketed gloss here is Swedenborg's. [LHC]<br />{*3} Swedenborg says "also" here because the word for "wild animal" in this particular phrase in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_908/bible_king-james-version_psalms_50_11" target=_top>Psalms 50:11</a> (זִיז [zîz]) is not the one that he has translated as "wild animal" elsewhere, not even in the phrase "every wild animal of the forest" in the first part of the quote, from verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_908/bible_king-james-version_genesis_8_10" target=_top>10</a>. He is in effect saying, "This second word for ‘wild animal' is just as much a symbol for the regenerate person as is the other word for ‘wild animal' previously quoted." [LHC, RS]<br />{*4} The unmentioned substance, in the passage just quoted, that is threatened to be given as food to "the wild animal" and "the bird" is human flesh. For other passages that mention corpses becoming food for wild animals and birds, see, for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_908/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_28_26" target=_top>Deuteronomy 28:26</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_908/bible_king-james-version_psalms_79_2" target=_top>Psalms 79:2</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_908/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_7_33" target=_top>Jeremiah 7:33</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_908/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_34_5" target=_top>Ezekiel 34:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_908/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_34_8" target=_top>8</a>.

Every wild animal that is with thee of all flesh. That this signifies all that was made living in the man of this church, is evident from the fact that "wild animal" is predicated of Noah, or of the 
man of this church, now regenerated, and manifestly refers to what follows, namely, fowl, beast, and creeping thing; for it is said, "every wild animal that is with thee of all flesh, as to fowl, and 
as to beast, and as to every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." The word in the original tongue here rendered "wild animal" signifies properly life, or what is living; but in the Word it is 
used both for what is living and for what is as it were not living, or a wild animal; so that unless one knows the internal sense of the Word, he is sometimes unable to see what is meant. The reason 
of this twofold meaning is that the man of the Most Ancient Church, in his humiliation before the Lord, acknowledged himself as not living, not even as a beast, but only as a wild animal; for those people 
knew man to be such when regarded in himself, or in what is his own. Hence this same word means what is living, and also means "wild animal."  [2] That it means "what is living" is evident in David: </p>
<p> 
    Thy wild animal shall dwell therein [that is, in God's inheritance]; Thou, O God, wilt confirm the poor with Thy good (Ps. 68:10). Here by "wild animal" because he shall dwell in the inheritance 
of God, no other is meant than the regenerated man; and so here, as in the verse we are considering, what is living in this man is meant. Again: </p>
<p>     Every wild animal of the forest is Mine, and 
the beasts upon the mountains where thousands are; I know all the fowls of the mountains, and the wild animals of My field are with Me (Ps. 50:10-11). Here "the wild animals of My field with Me" or 
with God, denote the regenerated man, thus what is living in him. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     All the fowls of the heavens made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches all the wild animals of the field 
brought forth (Ezek. 31:6), where the spiritual church is signified, as implanted, and what is living, in the man of that church. In Hosea: </p>
<p>     In that day will I make a covenant for them with 
the wild animal of the field and with the fowl of the heavens (Hos. 2:18),where those who are to be regenerated are meant, with whom a covenant is to be made. Indeed, so fully does "wild animal" signify 
"what is living" that the cherubim, or angels, seen by Ezekiel, are called the "four wild animals" or "living creatures" (Ezek. 1:5, 13-15, 19; 10:15).  [3] That "wild animal" in the opposite sense 
is taken in the Word for what is not living, is evident from many passages, of which only the following will be cited, for confirmation. In David: </p>
<p>     O deliver not the soul of Thy turtle-dove unto 
the wild animal (Ps. 74:19). In Zephaniah: </p>
<p>     How is the city become a desolation, a place for wild animals to lie down in (Zeph. 2:15). In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     And they shall no more be a prey to the 
nations, neither shall the wild animal of the earth eat them (Ezek. 34:28). Again: </p>
<p>     Upon his ruin all the fowl of the heavens shall dwell, and every wild animal of the field shall be upon his 
branches (Ezek. 31:13). In Hosea: </p>
<p>     There will I consume them like a lion; the wild animal of the field shall tear them (Hos. 13:8). In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     I have given thee for meat to the wild animals 
of the earth, and to the fowl of the heaven (Ezek. 29:5), an expression often occurring. And since the Jews remained in the sense of the letter only, and understood by "wild animal" a wild animal, 
and by "fowl" a fowl, not knowing the interior things of the Word, nor having any willingness to acknowledge them and so to be instructed, they were so cruel and such wild animals that they found their 
delight in not burying enemies killed in battle, but exposing them to be devoured by birds of prey and wild beasts; which also shows what a wild animal man is. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 908</b></p><p><b>908.</b>
'Every wild animal of all flesh that is with you' means everything that has been made living within the member of this Church. This is clear from the fact that 'wild animal' refers to Noah, the member 
of this Church who has now been regenerated, and plainly has reference to the things that follow, namely to 'birds, beasts, and creeping thing that creeps', for the words used are 'every wild animal 
of all flesh that is with you - birds, and beasts, and every creeping thing that creeps over the earth'. In the original language the word for wild animal strictly speaking means life or that which is 
living; but when used in the Word it means not only that which is living but also that which in one sense is not living, or a wild animal. Consequently unless a person is acquainted with the internal 
sense of the Word he cannot always know what is meant. The reason it carries both meanings is that the member of the Most Ancient Church, in humiliating himself before the Lord, acknowledged that he 
himself was not living, not even a domestic beast, but an animal living in the wild, for he knew that man is such when regarded in himself or as to the proprium. Consequently the same word means that 
which is living and also means a wild animal. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As to its meaning that which is living, this is clear in David,  </p>
<blockquote>
Your wild animals will dwell in it (the inheritance of God); You, O God, will 
strengthen the needy with Your goodness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2068:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 68:10</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here, because he is to dwell in the inheritance of God, nothing else is meant by 'wild animal' than a regenerate person, and so, as is the case 
here, that which is alive in him. In the same author,  </p>
<blockquote>
Every wild animal of the forest is mine, beasts on mountains of thousands; I know every bird of the mountains, and the wild animal of My field 
is with Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2050:10,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 50:10, 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here too 'wild animal of the field with Me', that is, with God, stands for a regenerate person and so for things with him that are alive. In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
In its branches 
all the birds of the air<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> made their nests, and under its branches every wild animal of the field gave birth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2031:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 31:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the formation of the spiritual Church and so stands for things 
with the member of the Church that are alive. In Hosea,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will make a covenant on that day with the wild animals of the field and with the birds of the air.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%202:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 2:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to people 
who are to be regenerated, with whom a covenant is to be made. Indeed the application of 'wild animal' to that which is alive extends even to the cherubs or angels seen by Ezekiel being called four 
wild animals, in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%201:5,%2013-15,%2019;%2010:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 1:5, 13-15, 19; 10:15</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That 'wild animal' in the contrary sense stands in the Word for that which is not alive, or a fierce wild animal, is clear from many places. Let just 
the following examples serve to confirm the point: In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Give not the soul of Your turtle dove to the wild animal. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2074:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 74:19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Zephaniah, </p>
<p>The city has become a desolation, a place for 
the wild animal to lie down in. Zeph. <a href="2.htm">2</a>.<a href="15.htm">15</a>. </p>
<p>In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
They will no more be a prey to the nations, and the wild animal of the land will not devour them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2034:28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 34:28</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Upon 
its ruin will dwell every bird of the air,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and on its branches will be every wild animal of the field. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2031:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 31:13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
There I will devour them like a lion, the wild animals of the 
field will tear them apart. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%2013:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 13:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
To the wild animal of the earth, and to the birds of the air<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> have I given [you] for food. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2019:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 19:5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The usage recurs fairly often. Moreover 
since the Jews were confined solely to the sense of the letter, and understood wild animal by 'wild animal' and bird by 'bird', they did not wish to know of, still less acknowledge, the inner contents 
of the Word, and so receive instruction. Indeed they themselves were so cruel, and such wild animals, that they took delight in not burying enemies they had slain in battle and in exposing them 
to be devoured by birds and by wild animals. These things also show what a wild animal man is.

omnis fera silvae, bestiae in montibus millium; novi omnem avem montium, et fera agri Mei Mecum, Ps. 1 10, 11; </p>
<p>ubi 'fera agri Mecum' seu cum Deo, etiam pro regenerato, ita pro vivis apud eum; apud Ezechielem, 	In 
ramis ejus nidificarunt omnis avis caelorum, et sub rami ejus genuerunt omnis fera agri, xxxi 6; </p>
<p>ubi de Ecclesia spirituali plantata, ita pro vivis apud hominem Ecclesiae apud Hosheam, 	Feriam 
foedus in die illo cum fera agri, et cum ave caelorum ii 18; </p>
<p>ibi de regenerandis, cum quibus 'foedus' pangendum: immo in tantum 'fera' significat vivum, ut cherubi seu angeli visi Ezechieli 
appellentur quatuor ferae, Ezech. i 5, 13-15, 19; x 15. [3] Quod 'fera' in contrario sensu pro non vivo seu pro immani fera in Verbo accipiatur, ex multis locis constat; solum haec pro confirmatione 
sint; apud Davidem; </p>
<p>	Ne des ferae animam turturis Tui, Ps. lxxiv 19: </p>
<p>apud Zephaniam, 	Urbs facta est in desolationem, in cubile ferae, ii 15:  apud Ezechielem, 	Non erunt amplius praeda gentibus, 
et fera terrae non comedet eos, xxxiv 28: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Super ruina ejus habitabunt omnis avis caelorum, et ad ramos ejus erunt omnis fera agri xxxi 13: </p>
<p>apud Hosheam, 	Consumam eos ibi, sicut leo, 
fera agri diffindet eos, xiii 8: </p>
<p>apud Ezechielem, 	Ferae terrae, et avi caelorum dari in cibum, xxix 5; </p>
<p>quod saepius occurrit: et quia Judaei in sensu litterae solum manebant, et per 'feram' intelligebant 
feram et per 'avem' avem, nec interiora Verbi scire, minus agnoscere, volebant, et sic instrui, etiam tam crudeles et tales ferae erant, ut jucundum suum perceperint in eo quod hostes proelio 
occisos non sepelirent, sed exponerent avibus et feris devorandos; ex quibus etiam constare potest qualis fera homo est. 	@1 Heb. [ ](hayah)$ </p>
