<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7401节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7401.</strong>“好叫你知道没有像耶和华我们神的”表只有一位神，除祂之外再无别神。这从以下事实清楚可知，当历史意义说“没有像耶和华神的”时，内义上的意思是，除祂之外再无别神；由于除祂之外再无别神，所以只有一位神。在圣言中，经上有时说“没有像耶和华神的”，还说“没有神像祂”。之所以在圣言中如此说，是因为那时，有教会的地方和没教会的地方一样，人们都拜许多神，每个人都认为自己的神优先于别人的神。他们以名字来区别这些神，以“耶和华”这个名来区别以色列人和犹太人的神。犹太人和以色列人自己也相信有许多神存在，但耶和华因其神迹而比其余的神更大。因此，当神迹终止时，他们立刻堕落，去拜其他神；这从圣言的历史部分明显看出来。诚然，他们口头上声称只用一位神，除祂之外再无别神，但他们心里并不相信。这解释了为何圣言说“耶和华比其他神更大”，“没有谁像祂一样”，如诗篇：<br />有何神大如神呢？你是行奇事的神。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗77.13.htm">77:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗77.14.htm">14</a>）<br /><br />谁像耶和华我们的神呢？（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗113.5.htm">113:5</a>）<br /><br />耶和华为大神，为大王，超乎万神之上。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗95.3.htm">95:3</a>）<br /><br />耶和华为大，当受极大的赞美；祂在万神之上，当受敬畏！（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗96.4.htm">96:4</a>）<br />因此，耶和华还被称为万神之神，万主之主（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗136.2.htm">136:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗136.3.htm">3</a>；但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.47.htm">2:47</a>）。然而，内义所包含的真理，即只有一位神，除祂之外再无别神，明显可见于以赛亚书：<br />你们要追念古时以来的往事；因为我是神，并无别神，没有谁像我一样。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛46.9.htm">46:9</a>）</p>

That thou mayest know that there is none like Jehovah our God. That this signifies that there is one God, and none besides Him, is evident from the fact that when in the historical sense it is said that 
"there is none like Jehovah God," in the internal sense it is meant that there is no God besides Him, and because there is none besides Him, that there is one God. In the Word it is sometimes said 
that "there is none like Jehovah God," and also that "there is no God like Him." It was so said in the Word, because at that time in the land where the church was, as also in the lands where the church 
was not, they worshiped many gods, and everyone preferred his own god to the god of another. They distinguished these gods by names, and the God of the Israelites and Jews by the name "Jehovah." The 
Jews and Israelites themselves also believed that there were many gods, but that Jehovah was greater than the rest on account of the miracles; and therefore when the miracles ceased, they at once fell 
away into the worship of other gods, as is manifest from the historical parts of the Word. That there is one God and none besides Him, they indeed said with the mouth, but did not believe with the 
heart. This then is the reason why it is said in the Word that "Jehovah is greater than the other gods," and "there is none like Him," as in David: </p>
<p>     Who is a great God like Thee? Thou art the God 
that doest wonders (Ps. 77:13-14).      Who is like unto Jehovah our God? (Ps. 113:5.) Jehovah is a great God, and a great king above all gods (Ps. 95:3). Jehovah is great and greatly to be praised, 
He is to be feared above all gods (Ps. 96:4).      Therefore also Jehovah is called God of gods, and Lord of lords (Ps. 136:2-3; Dan. 2:47). That this nevertheless means in the internal sense that 
there is one God, and none besides Him, is plain in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Remember the former things from an age, for I am God, and there is no God else, and there is none like Me (Isa. 46:9). </p>

'So that you may know that there is none like Jehovah our God' means that there is one God and none besides Him. This is clear from the consideration that when the historical sense says that 'none is 
like Jehovah God' the meaning in the internal sense is that there is no God besides Him, and that since there is none besides Him there is one God. In the Word it is frequently stated that there is none 
like Jehovah God, and also that there is no God like Him. It was stated in this way in the Word because in the land where the Church existed, as also in lands where the Church did not exist, people 
at that time worshipped a number of gods, and each person gave precedence to his own god over another's god. They distinguished those gods from one another by their names, the God of the Israelites 
and Jews by the name Jehovah. The Jews and Israelites themselves also believed that a number of gods existed, but that Jehovah was greater than all others on account of His miracles. When therefore those 
miracles ceased they instantly declined into the worship of other gods, as is evident from the historical parts of the Word. They did, it is true, declare with their lips that there is one God and 
none besides Him, but they did not believe it in their hearts. This then explains why the Word says that Jehovah is greater than all other gods and that there is none like Him, as in David,  </p>

However the truth which the internal sense contains - that there is one God and none besides Him - is evident in Isaiah, </p>

am God, and there is no God else; and there is not the like of Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2046:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 46:9</a>.

`Ut scias quod nullus sicut Jehovah Deus noster': quod significet quod unus Deus et non praeter Ipsum, constat ex eo quod cum in sensu historico dicitur `quod nullus sit sicut Jehovah Deus,' in sensu 
interno intelligatur quod nullus Deus praeter Ipsum, et quia nullus praeter Ipsum, quod unus Deus sit;{1} in Verbo aliquoties dicitur quod nullus sit sicut Jehovah Deus, tum quoque quod nullus Deus 
sit sicut Ipse; ita dictum est in Verbo quia eo tempore in terra ubi Ecclesia, sicut etiam in terris ubi non Ecclesia, plures deos coluerunt, et quisque suum deum praetulit deo alterius; distinguebant 
illos per nomina, (c)ac Israelitarum et (x)Judaeorum Deum per nomen `Jehovae'; ipsi Judaei et Israelitae crediderunt etiam plures deos dari, sed Jehovam reliquis majorem esse ob miracula; quapropter 
etiam cum miracula cessarunt, ilico ad cultum aliorum deorum lapsi sunt, ut patet ab historicis Verbi; quod unus Deus sit, et {2}non praeter Ipsum, quidem ore dixerunt, sed corde non crediderunt; {3}inde 
nunc in Verbo dicitur quod Jehovah sit major reliquis diis, et nullus sicut Ipse, {4}ut apud Davidem, Quis Deus magnus sicut Tu?  Tu Deus faciens mirabile, Ps. lxxvii 14, 15 [A.V. 13, 14]: </p>
<p>apud 
eundem, Quis sicut Jehovah Deus noster?  Ps. cxiii 5: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Deus magnus Jehovah, et Rex magnus super omnes deos, Ps. xcv 3: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Magnus Jehovah et laudatus valde, timendus Ille super 
omnes deos, Ps. xcvi (x)4: </p>
<p>ideo quoque Jehovah vocatur Deus deorum, et Dominus dominorum, Ps. cxxxvi 2, 3; Dan. ii 47: </p>
<p>quod tamen id in sensu interno sit, quod unus sit Deus, et {2}non praeter Ipsum, 
patet apud Esaiam, Recordamini priorum a saeculo, quia Ego Deus, et non amplius Deus; et non sicut Ego, xlvi 9. 	@1 i hic sensus est sensus internus illorum verborum, in sensu interno seu in sensu 
literae,$ 	@2 nullus$ 	@3 quod in Verbo dictum$ 	@4 constat$ </p>
