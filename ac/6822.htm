<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6822节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6822.</strong>教会比起我们的国家更是邻舍，因为关心教会的人也关心生活在他的国家之人的灵魂和永生。当他将一个人引向良善时，就是在关心教会。他若出于仁爱而如此行，就是在爱邻舍，因为他渴望并意愿天堂和永生的幸福属于他人。良善能被任何公民灌输给别人，但真理只能被身为教导真理的牧师之人灌输给别人。如果其他人如此行，异端邪说就会出现，教会就会变得混乱，四分五裂。当运用教会的真理将邻舍引向良善时，就是在行仁爱。如果在教会有某种东西被称为真理，却偏离良善，那么这个东西就不可再提，因为它不是真理。每个人都必须先从教会的教义，之后从主的圣言为自己获得真理；这真理必须是他的信之真理。</p>

The church is more the neighbor than our country, because he who has regard for the church, has regard also for the souls and eternal life of the men who are in the country. And the church is cared for 
when man is led to good, and he who does this from charity, loves the neighbor, for he desires and wills for another, heaven and happiness of life to eternity. Good can be instilled into another by 
anyone in his country, but not truth, except by those who are teaching ministers; if others do this, heresies arise, and the church is disturbed and rent asunder. Charity is practiced, if through the 
truth which is of the church, the neighbor is led to good. If in the church anything is called truth which leads away from good, this is not worthy of mention, for it is not truth. Everyone must first 
obtain for himself truth from the doctrine of the church, and afterward from the Word of the Lord; this must be the truth of his faith. </p>

The Church is the neighbour over one's country, for one who cares for the Church does so by caring for the souls and the eternal life of people living in his country; the Church is cared for when a person 
is led by him to good. If he does it out of charity he loves the neighbour since he desires and intends that heaven and the happiness of the life that lasts forever should be the other's. Good can 
be inculcated in another by any citizen, but truth only by those who are ministers that teach it. If others teach it, heresies arise, and the Church becomes confused and is torn apart. Charity is exercised 
when a truth that the Church possesses is used to lead the neighbour to good; and if in the Church something is said to be true and yet it leads away from good, it should not be repeated, for 
it is not the truth. Everyone must first obtain truth from the teachings of the Church, then after that from the Word of the Lord; and this must serve him as the truth composing his faith. </p>

</p><b>6822.</b>
Ecclesia est proximus prae patria, nam qui consulit Ecclesiae consulit animabus et vitae aeternae hominum qui in patria; et consulitur Ecclesiae cum ducitur homo ad bonum; et qui hoc facit ex {1}charitate, 
is amat proximum, nam is caelum et felicitatem vitae in aeternum alteri optat et vult.  Bonum potest alteri ab unoquovis in patria insinuari, non autem verum nisi ab illis qui ministri docentes 
sunt; si alii, existunt haereses, et Ecclesia turbatur et discerpitur.  Charitas exercetur si per verum quod est Ecclesiae ducitur proximus ad bonum; si in Ecclesia aliquod dicitur verum quod a bono 
abducit, hoc non memorandum est, nam non est verum.  Verum quisque sibi primum acquiret ex doctrina Ecclesiae, et postea ex Verbo Domini; hoc verum fidei ejus erit. 	@1 affectione charitatis$ </p>
