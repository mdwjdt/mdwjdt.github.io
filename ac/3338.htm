<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3338节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3338.</strong>除了这两种光外，还有热，热也分为两种，并且同样有两个不同的源头，即天堂之热和尘世之热。天堂之热出自天堂的太阳，就是主，尘世之热出自我们肉眼清晰可见的尘世太阳。天堂之热以属灵之爱和情感的形式显现给内在人；而尘世之热则以属世之爱和情感的形式显现给外在人。前一种热构成内在人的生命，而后一种热构成外在人的生命；因为没有爱和情感，人根本无法存活。这两种热之间也存在对应关系。这些热通过主的生命流注而变成爱和情感。因此在人看来，它们似乎不是热，但它们的确是热。因为就其内在人和外在人而言，人若不从主所流入的生命那里接受热，必立时倒下死亡。这些事实对每个人来说，因以下情况而显而易见：人越充满爱，就变得越温暖；爱越退却，他就变得越迟钝。人的意愿正是通过这热而活着，而他的理解力则出自上面所说的光。</p>

Besides these lights there are also heats, which likewise are from two fountains-the heat of heaven coming from its sun, which is the Lord; and the heat of the world from its sun, which is the luminary 
visible to our eyes. The heat of heaven manifests itself to the internal man under the form of spiritual loves and affections; but the heat of the world manifests itself to the external man under the 
form of natural loves and affections. The former heat produces the life of the internal man, but the latter that of the external man; for without love and affection man cannot live at all. Between 
these two heats also there are correspondences. These heats become loves and affections through the influx of the Lord's life; and hence they appear to man as if they were not heats, although they are; 
for unless as to both the internal and the external man, man derived heat from this source he would fall down dead in a moment. These facts must be evident to everybody from the circumstance that in 
proportion as man is inflamed with love, he grows warm; and in proportion as love recedes, he grows torpid. It is this heat from which the will of man lives, and it is the light above spoken of from 
which comes his understanding. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3338</b></p><p><b>3338.</b>
In addition to those two forms of light there are also two forms of warmth or heat, which likewise have two separate sources. The warmth of heaven comes from the Sun of heaven, which is the Lord, and 
the warmth of the world comes from the sun of the world, which is plainly visible before our eyes. The warmth of heaven manifests itself before the internal man by means of spiritual loves and affections, 
whereas the warmth of the world manifests itself before the external man by means of natural loves and affections. The first form of warmth constitutes the life of the internal man, whereas the 
second constitutes that of the external man; for without love and affection a person cannot live at all. Between those two forms of warmth also correspondences exist. Those two forms of it become loves 
and affections from the influx of the Lord's life, and therefore they show themselves to man as if they were not forms of warmth, when in fact that is what they are. For if a person did not receive 
warmth from the Lord's inflowing life, both in his internal man and in his external man, he would instantly fall down dead. These considerations are evident to anyone from the fact that to the extent 
a person is fired by love he also becomes warmer, and to the extent love departs he cools off. It is from this warmth that a person's will lives, but from the light spoken of above that his understanding lives. </p>

Praeter luces illas, etiam sunt calores, qui {1}quoque sunt ex bino fonte, calor caeli ex Sole illius qui est Dominus, et calor mundi ex sole illius, qui est luminare oculis nostris conspicuum; calor 
caeli se manifestat coram interno homine per amores et affectiones spirituales, calor autem mundi se manifestat coram externo homine per amores et affectiones naturales; ille calor facit vitam interni 
hominis, hic autem vitam externi; nam absque amore et {2}affectione ne hilum vivere potest homo: inter binos illos calores etiam sunt correspondentiae: calores illi fiunt amores et affectiones ex influxu 
vitae Domini, et inde apparent homini sicut non calores {3}essent, at usque sunt; nam nisi inde calor homini, tam quoad internum, quam quoad externum hominem, homo momento emortuus procumberet: 
patent haec {4}unicuique ex eo quod homo quantum accenditur amore, tantum quoque calescat, et quantum recedit amor, tantum torpescat: calor hic est, ex quo hominis voluntas vivit, lux autem, de qua supra, 
ex qua ejus intellectus. @1 etiam$  @2 affectionibus$  @3 fuissent$  @4 unicuivis$  </p>
