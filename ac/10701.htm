<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10701节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10701</strong>.“就用帕子蒙上脸”表教会、敬拜和圣言所取的内在形式并未显现给以色列民族，只向他们显现了没有内在的外在。这从“用帕子蒙上脸”的含义清楚可知，“用帕子蒙上脸”是指关闭内在，以便唯独没有内在的外在可以被看到。因为“摩西面皮发光”表示圣言、教会和敬拜的内在在外在事物里面闪耀（参看<a href="10691.htm">10691</a>节）。但这个民族的兴趣在于在于没有内在之物的外在事物，直到今天还是这样（参看<a href="10692.htm">10692</a>节提到的地方）。由此也明显可知，圣言、教会和敬拜在这个民族当中所取的外在形式是如何在天堂显现的；也就是说，事实上不是显为一个人的脸，而是显为脸前的面纱。因为就圣言的内层事物而言，他们就陷入这样的模糊之中。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 10701</b></p><p><b>10701.</b>
And he put a veil upon his faces. That this signifies that the internal of the church, of worship, and of the Word did not appear to the Israelitish nation, but only the external without the internal, 
is evident from the signification of "putting a veil upon his faces," as being to close the internal, so that only the external without the internal may appear; for by "the shining of the skin of Moses' 
faces," is signified the shining forth of the internal of the Word, of the church, and of worship in external things (see above, n. 10691). (That this nation was in external things without what is 
internal, and also is so at this day, may be seen at the places cited in n. 10692.) From this it is also evident how the external of the Word, of the church, and of worship with that nation appears 
in the heavens, namely, not indeed as the face of a man, but like a veil before the face, for in such obscurity are they concerning the interior things of the Word. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10701</b></p><p><b>10701.</b>
'And he put a veil over his face' means that the inward form which the Church, worship, and the Word take was not visible to the Israelite nation, only the outward without the inward. This is clear from 
the meaning of 'putting a veil over his face' as closing the inward level in order that the outward form alone, without what exists on the inward level, may be seen. For 'the gleaming of the skin 
of Moses' face' means the shining forth of the inward level of the Word, the Church, and worship within outward things, see above in <a href="10691.htm">10691</a>. But the interest of that nation lay, as it does at the present 
day, in outward things devoid of what is inward, see in the places referred to above in <a href="10692.htm">10692</a>. From all this it is also evident how the outward form which the Word, the Church, and worship take among 
that nation appears in heaven; that is to say, not indeed as a human face but as a veil before the face. For obscurity like this exists with them so far as the interior things of the Word are concerned.  </p>

</p><b>10701.</b>
`Et dedit super facies suas velamen':  quod significet quod internum Ecclesiae, cultus, et (x)Verbi non apparuerit genti Israeliticae, sed modo externum absque interno, constat ex significatione `dare 
super facies velamen' quod sit occludere internum ut modo externum absque interno appareat, nam per `coruscationem cutis facierum Moschis' significatur elucentia interni Verbi, Ecclesiae, et cultus 
in externis, (d)videatur supra n. 10691; quod gens illa in externis absque {1}interno fuerit, et quoque hodie sit, videatur in locis citatis supra n. 10692; ex his quoque patet quomodo externum Verbi, 
Ecclesiae, et cultus, {2} apud illam gentem apparet in caelis, nempe quod ne quidem ut facies hominis sed sicut velamen ante faciem, in tali enim obscuro de interioribus Verbi sunt. @1 internis$ @2 i quod$ </p>
