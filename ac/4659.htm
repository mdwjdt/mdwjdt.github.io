<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4659节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4659.</strong>如前所述（<a href="4652.htm">4652</a>节），人是一个灵，他的身体为了履行世上的功能而服务于他；我在其它地方也说过，灵是人的内在，身体是他的外在。人若对人的灵和他的身体之间的关系没有一个正确理解，就会由此以为灵就这样住在身体里面，身体可以说包围并裹住它。然而，要知道，人的灵的存在于身体中，既在它的整体里面，也在它的每个部位里面；灵是更纯粹的实质，既在运动器官中，也在感觉器官，以及其它一切部位中；而身体是某种物质事物，这种物质事物与灵处处联结，并适合那时灵所居的世界。这就是“人是一个灵，他的身体为了履行世上的功能而服务于他”，以及“灵是人的内在，身体是他的外在”这些话的意思。由此也明显可知，死后，人继续过一种活跃而有感觉的生活，和以前一样；他和在世时一样以人的形式存在，只是这人的形式更加完美了。</p>

It was said above (n. 4652) that man is a spirit, and that his body serves him for uses in the world; and it has been occasionally said. elsewhere that the spirit is man's internal, and the body his 
external. They who do not apprehend how the case is with man's spirit and with his body, may suppose from this that thus the spirit dwells within the body; and that the body as it were encompasses and 
invests it. Be it known however that the spirit of man is in the whole and every part of his body, and that it is its purer substance, both in its organs of motion and in those of sense, and everywhere 
else; and that the body is the material part that is everywhere annexed to it, adapted to the world in which it then is. This is what is meant by man's being a spirit, and by his body serving him for 
uses in the world; and by the spirit's being his internal, and the body his external. From this also it is evident that after death man is in an active and sensitive life, and also in the human form, 
in like manner as in the world, but in greater perfection. </p>

It was stated towards the end of <a href="4652.htm">4652</a> that man is a spirit and that the body serves him for functions he performs in the world, and in other places elsewhere that the spirit is a person's internal and 
the body his external. People who do not have a proper grasp of the relationship between a person's spirit and his body may suppose from this that the spirit accordingly dwells within the body and that 
the body so to speak surrounds it and clothes it. But it should be recognized that a person's spirit exists within the body, within the whole of it and within each part of it, and that its substance 
is purer, both in its motor organs and in its sensory organs, as well as in every other part, whereas the body is something material linked to it at every point and suited to the world it inhabits 
at that time. This is what is meant by the statement that man is a spirit and that the body serves him for functions performed in the world, and that the spirit is man's internal and the body his external. 
From this it is also evident that after death a person continues to lead a life which is just as active, involving the senses, as before; also, that he exists in a human form as in the world, though 
it is now a more perfect one. </p>

{1}  Dictum n. 4652 f. quod homo sit spiritus et quod corpus inserviat ei pro usibus in mundo, et passim alibi quod spiritus sit internum hominis et corpus externum ejus; qui non capiunt quomodo se 
habet cum spiritu hominis et cum corpore ejus, inde autumare possunt quod sic spiritus habitet {2}intra corpus et quod corpus quasi cingat et investiat illum; sed sciendum quod spiritus hominis sit 
in corpore, in toto et in omni parte ejus, et quod sit substantia ejus purior, tam in organis ejus motoriis quam in sensoriis, et ubivis alibi (m)et quod corpus sit materiale ei ubivis annexum, adaequatum 
mundo in quo tunc est; hoc intelligitur per quod homo sit spiritus et corpus inserviat ei pro usibus in mundo et quod spiritus sit internum hominis et corpus externum ejus; inde etiam patet 
quod homo post mortem similiter in vita activa et sensitiva sit, tum quoque in forma humana sicut in mundo, sed in perfectiore.      @1 This   is a later addition written after 4660 but marked for 
insertion here$      @2 in corpore intra illud$ </p>
