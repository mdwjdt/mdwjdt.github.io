<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6930.</strong>后来，水星灵给我送来一张不平整的长纸，是由许多张纸粘起来的。它上面似乎有像我们星球那样的印刷字体，于是我问他们，他们当中有没有像印刷术这样的东西。可他们说没有；不过，他们知道我们地球有这种纸。他们不愿意再多说什么，但我能发觉，他们在想，在我们星球，真实事物的知识就具有这种性质，也就是说，一个人若不将眼睛，因而心思专注于这张纸上，知识就与他不沾边了。他们以这种方式嘲笑我们星球的人，好像我们星球的人若不从纸上就什么也不知道。但我告诉他们真实情况是什么样。一段时间后，他们回来又送给我一张纸，和前一张一样也是印刷的，只是没有如此粘在一起，也不那么凌乱，而是干净、整洁。他们说，他们收到进一步的信息，即：我们地球有这种纸，并且书籍是由它们制成的。</p>

There was afterward sent to me from the spirits of Mercury a long irregular paper consisting of a number of papers stuck together, which appeared as if printed with type such as there is on this earth. 
I asked whether they have such things among them? but they said that they have not; but that they know there are such papers on our earth. They were unwilling to say more, but it was given to perceive 
that they were thinking that in this earth the knowledges of things are of this nature, thus separate from the man himself, except when the man keeps his eye and thus his mind on such papers. In this 
way they were ridiculing among themselves the men of this earth, as if they knew nothing except from papers; but they were instructed how the case herein is. After some time they returned, and sent 
to me another paper, also as it were printed like the former, yet not so stuck together and rude, but becoming and neat. They said that they had been further informed that on our earth there are such 
papers, and books made of them. </p>

After this the spirits belonging to Mercury sent me a long, uneven sheet of paper consisting of many sheets pasted together. It seemed to have printed type on it like that on our planet, so I asked them 
whether they had such a thing as printing among them. They said that they did not but that they knew of the existence on our planet of sheets like that. They did not wish to say anything more, but 
I could tell that they were thinking that this was what the knowledge of real things was like on our planet, that is, that it was separate from a person himself except when he focused his eye and so 
his mind on such sheets of paper. For that reason they laughed among themselves at people belonging to our planet who seemingly knew nothing except from sheets of paper. But I told them what the situation 
really was. After some time those spirits came back and sent me another sheet of paper which also seemed to be covered with type as the previous one was but consisted of less pastings together and 
was not so untidy. Rather, it was neat and trim. They said that they had received the further information that on our planet sheets of paper are like this and that books are made out of them. </p>

Postea mihi a spiritibus Mercurii mittebatur charta longa, inaequalis, a pluribus chartis conglutinata, quae apparebat sicut impressa typis qualibus in hac tellure; quaesivi num talia haberent apud 
se, sed dicebant quod non habeant, verum quod (x)sciant tales chartas in nostra tellure dari; non volebant plura dicere, sed dabatur percipere quod cogitarent, quod in hac tellure cognitiones rerum essent 
tales, ita separatae ab ipso homine, nisi eum homo in talibus chartis {1}teneret oculum, et sic mentem; ita {2}subsannabant apud se homines {3}hujus telluris, quasi nihil scirent nisi ex chartis; 
sed instruebantur quomodo cum hoc se haberet.  Post aliquod tempus redierunt, et ad me mittebant aliam chartam etiam sicut typis exaratam ut erat prior, sed non ita conglutinatam et incomptam, verum 
decentem et nitidam; dicebant quod informati ulterius essent quod in hac tellure tales chartae sint, et inde libri. 	@1 tenerent$ 	@2 After telluris$ 	@3 nostrae$ </p>
