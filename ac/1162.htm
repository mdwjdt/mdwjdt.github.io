<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1162.</strong>“含的儿子”表属于分离之信的事物。这从前文可推知。要知道“含”和“含的儿子”是什么意思，首先必须知道什么是脱离仁之信。脱离仁之信并非信。没有信，就没有敬拜，无论内在的还是外在的。即便有敬拜，那也是败坏的敬拜，“含”因此还表败坏的内在敬拜。凡将脱离仁爱的属天、属灵之物的知识视为信的，都持有虚假的信仰。因为最坏的人有时比其他人更有知识，例如那些不断活在仇恨、报复和通奸中，因此如同地狱里的人，并且死后会变成魔鬼之人。由此可见，知识并不是信。确切地说，信是对属于信之物的承认；这种承认决非外在的，而是内在的，是唯独主经由人里面的仁爱所作的工。这种承认决非停留在口头上，而是应用于生活。通过一个人的生活就能知道其承认的性质。凡拥有信之认知的知识，却没有仁爱之人都被称作“含的儿子”。无论他们的知识是有关圣言的内在认知及其最深奥秘密的知识，还是有关圣言字义所包含的一切事物的知识，亦或是其它真理的知识，无论为它们取什么样的名字，又或是构成外在敬拜的一切仪式的知识，只要没有仁爱，他们就是“含的儿子”。凡被称作“含的儿子”之人都具有这种秉性，这一点从现在所讨论的“民族”清楚看出来。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1162.</strong> The symbolism of the sons of Ham as characteristics of a detached faith follows logically. In order to see what Ham is, and therefore what Ham's sons are, it is necessary to know what faith isolated from charity is. Faith isolated from charity is no faith at all, and where there is no faith there is no worship, inward or outward. If any kind of worship does exist, it is corrupt worship, so Ham also symbolizes inner worship that has been corrupted.<br />People who use the term faith for a bare knowledge of heavenly and spiritual facts unconnected with neighborly love have the wrong idea. Sometimes the most knowledgeable people are the worst ones, after all. For example, they might be people who live lives of unremitting hatred and revenge, or of adultery — hellish individuals, who turn into devils when bodily life ends. This proves that knowledge is not faith. On the contrary, faith is an acknowledgment of the tenets of faith, and acknowledgment is never external but internal; it is a work the Lord alone accomplishes in us through charity. And acknowledgment is never a matter of lip service but of life; the way we live reveals the quality of our acknowledgment.<br />[2] "Child of Ham" is a term that applies to all who are well educated in religious concepts but lack charity. No matter whether we have learned the deeper knowledge and sheer mysteries buried in the Word; whether we have learned all the details of its literal sense; whether we have learned other types of truth — whatever name they go under — that give us a new perspective on our knowledge of the Word; or whether we are familiar with all points of ritual belonging to external forms of worship; if we do not have charity, we are children of Ham. The fact that those called the children of Ham are like this can be seen from the nations discussed next. </p>

That by "the sons of Ham" are signified the things that belong to this separated faith, follows from this. In order that it may be known what is meant by "Ham," and therefore by "the sons of Ham," it 
must first be known what faith separated from charity is. Faith separated from charity is no faith. Where there is no faith, there is no worship, neither internal nor external. If there be any worship 
at all, it is corrupt worship, and therefore by "Ham" is likewise signified internal worship corrupted. They hold a false opinion who call the mere memory-knowledge of things celestial and spiritual, 
separated from charity, faith. For sometimes the worst of men have this knowledge more than others-as those who live in continual hatred and vindictiveness, and in adultery, and are therefore infernal, 
and after the life of the body become devils. It may be seen from this that memory-knowledge is not faith. But faith is the acknowledgment of the things which are of faith; and this acknowledgment 
is by no means external, but internal, and is the working of the Lord alone through the charity in a man. And this acknowledgment is by no means a thing of the mouth, but of the life. From the life of 
everyone it may be known what his acknowledgment is. All they are called "sons of Ham" who have a memory-knowledge of the knowledges of faith, and have not charity, whether it be a memory-knowledge 
of the interior knowledges of the Word, and of its veriest mysteries, or a memory-knowledge of all things in the literal sense of the Word, or a memory-knowledge of other truths, whatever their name, 
from which these may be regarded, or a knowledge of all the rituals of external worship-if they have not charity, they are "sons of Ham." That they who are called "sons of Ham" are of this character, 
is evident from the nations now treated of. </p>

That 'the sons of Elam' means things that belong to separated faith follows from what appears above. To know what 'Hem' means and from that 'the sons of Ham', one must know what faith separated from 
charity is. Faith separated from charity is. Faith separated from charity is no faith. And where there is no faith there is no worship, neither internal nor external. If any worship does exist it is corrupted 
worship, and this is why 'Ham' likewise means corrupted internal worship. The individual belief is false in people who apply the term 'faith' to a mere knowledge of celestial and spiritual things 
separated from charity. For sometimes the most evil people of all - such as those who have led lives continually hating, getting revenge, and committing adultery, and who are therefore like those 
in hell and after life in the body become devils - are more knowledgeable than others. From this it becomes clear that knowledge is not faith. Rather, faith is the acknowledgement of the things that 
belong to faith; and that acknowledgement is in no way external but internal, being the operation of the Lord alone through the charity present with a person. Nor is acknowledgement in any way of the 
lips but of the life. It is from a person's life that the nature of his acknowledgement may be known. All who have a knowledge of the cognitions of faith but have no charity are called 'the sons of Ham'. 
Whether their knowledge is a knowledge of the interior cognitions of the Word and its deepest mysteries, or a knowledge of all that the literal sense of the Word contains, or a knowledge of other 
truths, from which these may be regarded, no matter what name they are given, or whether it is a knowledge of all the rituals that constitute external worship, they are 'sons of Ham' if they have no charity. 
That those called 'the sons of Ham' are such is clear from the nations now under discussion. </p>

</p><b>1162.</b>
Quod per 'filios' Hami' significentur quae fidei separatae sunt, inde sequitur; ut sciri possit quid Ham, et inde quid filii Hami sciendum est quid fides separata a charitate; fides separata a charitate 
est nulla fides; ubi nulla fides, nullus est cultus, neque internus neque externus; si aliquis cultus, est cultus corruptus, quare per 'Hamum' pariter significatur cultus internus corruptus:  in 
falsa opinione sunt qui fidem vocant solam scientiam caelestium et spiritualium separatam a charitate, nam scientiam habent prae aliis quandoque omnium pessimi, ut qui in continuis odiis et vindictis 
inque adulteriis vivunt, proinde qui infernales sunt et post vitam corporis fiunt diaboli; inde constare potest quod scientia non sit fides, sed fides est agnitio illorum quae sunt fidei, et agnitio nusquam 
est externa sed interna; estque solius Domini operatio per charitatem apud hominem, et agnitio nusquam est oris sed est vitae; ex vita cujusvis sciri potest qualis agnitio.  'Filii Hami' dicuntur 
omnes qui scientiam cognitionum fidei habent et non charitatem; sive scientiam cognitionum interiorum Verbi ipsorumque ejus mysteriorum; sive scientiam omnium quae in Verbi sensu litterali sunt; sive 
scientiam aliarum veritatum, a quibus illas spectare possunt, quocumque nomine sint; sive cognitionem omnium ritualium cultus externi; si non charitatem habent, sunt 'filii Hami'; quod tales sint qui 
vocantur filii Hami, constat ex gentibus de quibus nunc. </p>
