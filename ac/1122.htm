<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1122节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1122.</strong>另外，我还得知，上古教会成员有最快乐的梦境，以及异象，同时还被暗示它们所表示的意义。这就是他们的代表物，包括乐园及其它事物的源头。因此，在他们眼里，具有外在意义的尘世和世俗之物等同于无。他们没觉得这些物体有任何快乐可言，只以它们所代表和象征的事物为乐。所以，看到尘世的物体，他们根本不思想这些物体，只思及它们所代表和象征的事物，这些事物才是最令他们感到快乐的，因为它们是诸如天堂中所存在的那类事物，他们由此看到主自己。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1122.</strong> I learned further that people in the earliest church had the most pleasant dreams, and visions as well, and that the meanings of the dreams and visions were suggested to them at the same time. This led to their use of paradise and other images as metaphors.<br />The objects of their outer senses, which belonged to the earth and the world, accordingly meant nothing to them. They felt no pleasure in those things but only in what they symbolized and represented. As a result, when they saw earthly objects, they did not think at all about them but only about the qualities they symbolized and represented. Such qualities inspired them with great pleasure, because these were the kinds of things that existed in heaven and revealed the Lord to them. </p>

I have been further informed that the men of the Most Ancient Church had most delightful dreams, and also visions, and that it was insinuated into them at the same time what they signified. Hence their 
paradisal representations, and many other things. The objects of the external senses therefore, which are earthly and worldly, were nothing to them; nor had they any perception of delight in them, 
but only in what they signified and represented; and therefore when they looked at earthly objects they did not think about them at all, but only about the things which they signified and represented, 
which were most delightful to them; for they were such things as are in heaven, from which they see the Lord Himself. </p>

I have learned in addition that members of the Most Ancient Church experienced most delightful dreams, as well as visions, and that what these meant was instilled at the same time. This was the source 
of their representations involving paradise gardens and much else. To them therefore earthly and worldly objects of the external senses were as nothing. They did not perceive any delight in those objects, 
only in the things which they meant and represented. Consequently when they looked at earthly objects they thought not at all of the objects, but only of the things they meant and represented, 
which to them were most delightful, for they were such things as exist in heaven, from which they behold the Lord Himself. </p>

Porro instructus sum quod Antiquissimae Ecclesiae homines habuerint deliciosissima somnia, et praeterea visiones, et quod iis una tunc insinuatum, quid significarent; inde illorum repraesentationes 
paradisiacae, et plura:  ideo illis objecta sensuum externorum quae terrestria et mundana, nihil erant, nec in iis quicquam jucunditatis percipiebant, modo in illis quae significabant et repraesentabant; 
quare cum objecta terrestria videbant, nihil de illis cogitabant, solum de illis quae significabant et repraesentabant, quae illis jucundissima (x)fuerunt, nam erant talia quae in caelo sunt, ex quibus 
Ipsum Dominum vident. </p>
