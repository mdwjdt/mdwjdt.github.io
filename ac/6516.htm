<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6516.</strong>“我在迦南地为我所掘的坟墓，你要把我埋葬在那里”表它（即教会）要在以前教会曾存在之地复活得生命。这从“坟墓”和“埋葬”，以及“迦南地”的含义清楚可知：“坟墓”和“埋葬”是指复活得生命（参看<a href="5551.htm">5551</a>节）；“迦南地”是指主的国度和教会（<a href="1413.htm">1413</a>，<a href="1437.htm">1437</a>，<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="1866.htm">1866</a>，<a href="3038.htm">3038</a>，<a href="3481.htm">3481</a>，<a href="3705.htm">3705</a>，<a href="4240.htm">4240</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>节）。雅各之所以想被葬在迦南地，就是埋葬亚伯拉罕和以撒的地方，而不是葬在别处，是因为他的后代要拥有这地，他要躺卧在他自己的民当中。然而，就内义而言，所表示的并非这一点，而是某种其它事物，即重生和复活，因为教会就在其中，即就居于重生和复活之中。事实上，“埋葬”在内义上表示重生和复活（<a href="2916.htm">2916</a>，<a href="2917.htm">2917</a>，<a href="4621.htm">4621</a>，<a href="5551.htm">5551</a>节）；而“迦南地”表示教会，这从刚才所引用的经文明显看出来；“亚伯拉罕，以撒和雅各”表示在神性本身和神性人身方面的主，在相对意义上表示在其内在和外在方面的主之国度（<a href="1965.htm">1965</a>，<a href="1989.htm">1989</a>，<a href="2011.htm">2011</a>，<a href="3245.htm">3245</a>，<a href="3305.htm">3305</a>，<a href="4615.htm">4615</a>，<a href="6098.htm">6098</a>，<a href="6185.htm">6185</a>，<a href="6276.htm">6276</a>节）。这就是他们葬在那地在内义上所表示的；因此，这解释了为何在相信复活的犹太人当中，这样的观点仍继续存在，即：哪怕他们葬在了别处，也会在迦南地复活。<br />之所以说教会将在“以前教会曾存在之地”复活得生命，是因为自上古时代起，主的教会就在迦南地（<a href="3686.htm">3686</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="4454.htm">4454</a>，<a href="4516.htm">4516</a>，<a href="4517.htm">4517</a>，<a href="5136.htm">5136</a>节）。也正因如此，亚伯拉罕被吩咐往那里去，雅各的后代也被领进那地。这不是因为那地比其它的地更神圣，而是因为自上古时代起，那里所有的地方，包括省府、城市，以及山河，都是诸如属于主国度的那类事物的代表；赋予这些地方的实际名字就包含这类事物。因为从天上赋予一个地方，以及一个人的每个名字都包含某种属天和属灵之物；当名字从天上被赋予时，这种属天、属灵之物就在那里被感知到；赋予这些名字的，正是上古教会，该教会是属天的，与天堂相通。因此，教会又要存在于那地的原因是，圣言将要被赐下，其中的每个细节都是某种属灵或属天之物的代表，并表示这种事物；因此，天上和地上一样，也要理解圣言。若非地名和人名拥有灵义，这是绝无可能实现的。这就是雅各的后代被领进迦南地的原因，也是圣言写就所藉由的众先知在那里复活，因而一个教会的代表在雅各的后代中间得以建立的原因。由此可见为何说一个教会将要在以前教会曾存在之地复活得生命。<br />圣言中的名字表示事物（参看<a href="1224.htm">1224</a>，<a href="1264.htm">1264</a>，<a href="1876.htm">1876</a>，<a href="1888.htm">1888</a>，<a href="4442.htm">4442</a>，<a href="5225.htm">5225</a>节），我在很多地方也解释过这些名字的含义。但事实上，天上的人都明白圣言里的名字是什么意思，并且他们无需接受教导就能明白；这是一个至今不为知的奥秘，故有必要描述之。当阅读圣言时，主就会流入，并进行教导；说来神奇，灵界也有着述，我有时看见它们，还能阅读，只是不明白。然而，善灵和天使却完全理解它们，因为这些着作与他们的通用语言一致。我被引导知道其中的每句话，甚至每个字都含有属于灵界的那类事物，因而含有属灵事物在里面；这些事物通过呼吸，通过说这些话时所产生的情感，因而通过对它们或柔滑或粗硬的不同调节而被感知。不过，恐怕几乎没有人相信这一切。揭开这个奥秘，是为了叫人们知道，天上的人能立刻明白写在天上的圣言中的名字是什么意思。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6516</b></p><p><b>6516.</b>
In my sepulchre which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. That this signifies that the church was to be resuscitated where a former church had been, is evident from 
the signification of a "sepulcher," and of "burying," as being resuscitation (see n. 5551); and from the signification of the "land of Canaan," as being the Lord's kingdom and church (n. 1413, 1437, 1607, 
1866, 3038, 3481, 3705, 4240, 4447). The reason why Jacob desired to be buried in the land of Canaan, where Abraham and Isaac were buried, and not elsewhere, was that his descendants were to possess 
that land, and he would lie among his own. In the internal sense however, not this, but something else was signified, namely, regeneration and resurrection, because therein is the church; for in the 
internal sense by "burial" is signified regeneration and resurrection (n. 2916, 2917, 4621, 5551); and by the "land of Canaan" is signified the church, as is evident from the passages cited just above; 
and by "Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob" is signified the Lord as to the Divine Itself and the Divine Human, and in the relative sense the Lord's kingdom as to its internal and external (n. 1965, 1989, 
2011, 3245, 3305, 4615, 6098, 6185, 6276). Such then is the signification in the internal sense of their burial there; and hence with the Jews who believe in a resurrection the opinion still survives 
that although they may be buried elsewhere, they will rise again there. [2] The reason why it is said that the church will be revived "where the former church had been," is that from the most ancient 
times the Lord's church had been in the land of Canaan (n. 3686, 4447, 4454, 4516, 4517, 5136). It was for this reason that Abraham was ordered to go there, and that the descendants of Jacob were brought 
into it; and this not because that land was more holy than all other lands, but because from the most ancient times all the places there-provinces, and cities, and mountains, and rivers-had been 
representative of such things as belong to the Lord's kingdom; and the very names that were given them involved such things. For every name given from heaven to any place, and also to any person, involves 
what is celestial and spiritual; and when it has been given from heaven, it is perceived there; and it was the Most Ancient Church, which was celestial and had communication with heaven, that gave 
the names. The reason therefore why the church was to be there again, was that the Word was to be given, in which all things were to be representative and significative of things spiritual and celestial, 
and thus the Word might be understood in heaven as well as on earth; which could not possibly have been done unless the names of places and of persons were significative. For this reason the descendants 
of Jacob were brought in there; and prophets were there raised up by whom the Word was written; and for this reason also the representative of a church was instituted among the descendants of 
Jacob. Hence it is plain why it is said that a church was to be resuscitated where the former church had been. [3] That the names which are in the Word signify things, may be seen above, n. 1224, 1264, 
1876, 1888, 4442, 5225, and in many other places where the signification of names is explained; but that the names in the Word are perceived in heaven as to their signification, and this without 
instruction, is a secret which no one has hitherto known, and therefore it must be told. When the Word is being read, the Lord flows in and teaches; and wonderful to say there are writings in the spiritual 
world also, which I have sometimes seen, and have been able to read, but not to understand; yet they are clearly understood by good spirits and angels, because they are in accord with their universal 
language; and it has been given me to know that every word therein, down to the very syllables, involves such things as belong to that world, thus spiritual things; and that they are there perceived 
from the breathing, and from the affection resulting from their utterance, thus from a softer or harsher modifying forth; but this perhaps scarcely anyone will believe. This has been disclosed in 
order that it may be known that the names in the Word, having been written in heaven, are at once perceived there in respect to their signification. </p>

'In my grave which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan, there you are to bury me' means that it - the Church - was to be restored to life where the previous one had existed. This is clear from the 
meaning of 'a grave' and 'burying' as restoring to life, dealt with in <a href="5551.htm">5551</a>; and from the meaning of 'the land of Canaan' as the Lord's kingdom and the Church, dealt with in <a href="1413.htm">1413</a>, <a href="1437.htm">1437</a>, <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>, <a href="1866.htm">1866</a>, <a href="3038.htm">3038</a>, <a href="3481.htm">3481</a>, <a href="3705.htm">3705</a>, <a href="4240.htm">4240</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>. The reason Jacob wished to be buried in the land of Canaan, where Abraham and Isaac had been buried, and not in any other place was that his descendants were going to possess 
that land, and so he would be lying among his own people. But in the internal sense not this but something else is meant, namely regeneration and resurrection, because these are what the Church resides 
in. For 'burial' means in the internal sense regeneration and resurrection, <a href="2916.htm">2916</a>, <a href="1917.htm">1917</a>, <a href="4621.htm">4621</a>, <a href="5551.htm">5551</a>. While 'the land of Canaan' means the Church, as is evident from the places referred to above in 
the present paragraph, and Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob represent the Lord as regards the Divine itself and the Divine Human, and in the relative sense the Lord's kingdom as regards the internal aspect 
and the external aspect of it, <a href="1965.htm">1965</a>, <a href="1989.htm">1989</a>, <a href="2011.htm">2011</a>, <a href="3245.htm">3245</a>, <a href="3305.htm">3305</a>(end), <a href="4615.htm">4615</a>, <a href="6098.htm">6098</a>, <a href="6185.htm">6185</a>, <a href="6276.htm">6276</a>. This then is what is meant in the internal sense by the burial of them in that land; and it explains why among 
Jews who believe in resurrection the conviction continues to exist that even though they have been buried in some other place they will nevertheless rise again in the land of Canaan. </p>

 The reason 
why it is said that the Church was to be restored to life in the place where the previous one had existed is that the Lord's Church had existed in that land since most ancient times, see <a href="3686.htm">3686</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>, 
<a href="4454.htm">4454</a>, <a href="4516.htm">4516</a>, <a href="4517.htm">4517</a>, <a href="5136.htm">5136</a>. It also explains why Abraham was told to go there and why the descendants of Jacob were led into it. And the reason for all this was not that the land was holier than all others 
but that since most ancient times all the locations there, both provinces and cities as well as mountains and rivers, had been representative of such things as belonged to the Lord's kingdom; and 
the actual names conferred on those locations implied such things. For every particular name supplied from heaven to a place or person implies some celestial or spiritual reality; and when the name has 
been supplied from heaven, that reality is perceived by them there. The Most Ancient Church too, which was celestial and was in contact with heaven, was one that used to confer names. The reason therefore 
why the Church was to exist again in that land was that a Word was going to be given in which every detail would be representative of and would mean some spiritual or celestial reality, and that 
Word would accordingly be understood in heaven no less than on earth. But this could not possibly have been accomplished unless also the names of places and persons had had spiritual meanings. This 
is the reason why the descendants of Jacob were led into that land, why prophets were raised up there through whom the Word was written, and therefore why a representative of the Church was established 
among Jacob's descendants. From all this one may see the reason for the statement that the Church was to be restored to life where the previous one had existed.  </p>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 The fact that names in the Word 
mean spiritual things may be seen in <a href="1224.htm">1224</a>, <a href="1264.htm">1264</a>, <a href="1876.htm">1876</a>, <a href="1888.htm">1888</a>, <a href="4442.htm">4442</a>, <a href="5225.htm">5225</a>, as well as in the multitude of places where explanations are given of what their meanings are. But the fact that in heaven they 
perceive what the meanings are of names used in the Word, and that they do this without prior instruction, is an arcanum unknown as yet to anyone and must therefore be described When the Word is read 
the Lord comes in and teaches; also - and this is one of the marvels in the spiritual world - writings exist, which I have frequently seen and been able to read yet not understand. But good spirits 
and angels understand them perfectly well because those writings accord with the universal language they speak. I have been led to know that individual words used there, even individual letters, hold 
within themselves the kinds of things that belong to that world, thus spiritual things, and that these are perceived there from the breath that is used, and from the affection resulting from the uttering 
of those words, thus from the varying smooth or rough delivery of them. But it is probable that hardly anyone will believe this. This arcanum has been disclosed so that people may know that those 
in heaven perceive instantly what the meanings are of names used in the Word, because those names are registered in heaven. </p>

`In sepulcro meo, quod fodi mihi in terra Canaan, ibi sepelias me':  quod significet quod resuscitanda, nempe Ecclesia, ubi prior fuerat, constat ex significatione `sepulcri et sepeliri' quod sit resuscitatio, 
de qua n. 5551, et ex significatione `terrae Canaanis' quod sit regnum Domini et Ecclesia, de qua n. 1413, 1437, 1607, 1866, 3038, 3481, 3705, 4240, 4447.  {1}Causa quod Jacob in terra Canaane 
ubi Abraham et Jishak, et non alibi sepeliri {2}voluerit, erat quia posteri {3}ejus illam possessuri essent, (c)et sic inter suos {4}cubaret; at {5} in sensu interno non id sed aliud {6}significabatur, 
nempe regeneratio et resurrectio, quia ibi Ecclesia, nam per `sepulturam' in sensu interno significatur regeneratio et resurrectio, n. 2916, 2917, 4621, 5551, et per `terram Canaanem' Ecclesia, 
ut patet ex locis hic supra citatis; perque `Abrahamum, Jishakum, et Jacobum' Dominus quoad Ipsum Divinum, ac Divinum Humanum, ac in sensu respectivo regnum Domini quoad internum et externum ejus, n. 
1965, 1989, 2011, (x)3245, 3305 fin., 4615, 6098, 6185, 6276; hoc nunc in sensu interno per sepulturam illorum ibi significatur; inde apud Judaeos, qui resurrectionem credunt, adhuc manet opinio quod 
tametsi alibi sepulti, usque ibi resurrecturi sint.  [2]Quod dicatur quod Ecclesia resuscitanda ubi prior fuerat, est quia Ecclesia Domini  ab antiquissimis temporibus ibi fuerat, videatur n. 3686, 4447, 
4454, 4516, 4517, 5136; inde quoque erat quod Abraham illuc ire jussus sit tum quoque quod posteri Jacobi illuc introducti sint, et hoc non ob causam {7}quia terra illa sanctior esset reliquis sed 
quia ab antiquissimis temporibus omnia loca ibi, tam provinciae quam urbes, tum quoque montes et fluvii, repraesentativa {8}erant talium quae sunt regni Domini, ac ipsa nomina quae illis indita, {9}involvebant 
talia; nam unumquodvis nomen quod alicui loco, et quoque personae, e caelo datur, involvit caeleste et spirituale; et cum datum est e caelo, tunc {10} percipitur ibi; et Antiquissima Ecclesia, 
quae caelestis et communicationem habuit cum caelo, fuit quae nomina indiderat; causa {11}ergo quod ibi iterum Ecclesia, erat quia Verbum daretur in quo omnia et singula repraesentativa et significativa 
essent spiritualium et caelestium, et sic Verbum in caelo intelligeretur aeque ac in terra; quod nequaquam fieri potuit nisi nomina locorum et personarum etiam significarent; inde est quod illuc 
introducti fuerint posteri Jacobi, et inde ibi exsuscitati prophetae per quos Verbum scriptum, et quoque ideo apud posteros Jacobi {12} repraesentativum Ecclesiae institutum est; inde patet cur dictum 
sit quod resuscitanda Ecclesia ubi prior fuerat.  [3](s)Quod nomina quae in Verbo, significent res, videatur  n. 1224, 1264, 1876, 1888, 4442, 5225, praeter perpluries ubi explicatum est quid significant; 
at quod nomina quae in Verbo, percipiantur in caelo quid significant, et hoc absque instructione, est arcanum quod adhuc nemo scit, quare dicendum:  cum legitur Verbum tunc Dominus influit et 
docet; sunt quoque, quod mirabile, in mundo spirituali scripturae, quas aliquoties vidi et quas legere potui sed non intelligere, verum a spiritibus bonis et angelis intelliguntur clare, quia concordant 
cum lingua eorum universali; et scire datum est quod singulae voces ibi, usque ad singulas syllabas, involvant talia quae mundi illius sunt, ita spiritualia, et quod ibi percipiantur ex aspiratione, 
et ex affectione resultante ex enuntiatione earum, ita ex mitiore (c)et asperiore emodificatione; sed hoc fortassis vix aliquis crediturus est; {13}hoc detectum est ut sciatur quod nomina in Verbo,
