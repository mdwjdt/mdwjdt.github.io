<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1757节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">关于灵人的言语及其多样性（续）</h4><br />1757.如前所述，灵人与世人的对话是通过话语进行的，而灵人们自己之间的对话则是通过诸如构成思维的观念（话语的最初来源）进行的。然而，这些观念不象人活在肉身时的观念那样模糊，而是象构成言语的观念那样清楚有别。人类思想会随着肉体的消散而变得更加明确清晰，思想观念会变得离散，以便它们逐渐服务于清晰的言语形式。因为模糊已随着肉体消散，因而思想可以说从它所受的束缚和遮蔽它的阴影中被释放出来，变得更加自然、即时。结果，对每一个具体观念的洞察，以及对它的直觉和话语都变得更为直接、迅速。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1757.</strong> The Way Spirits Talk (Continued) and How It Varies<br />SPIRITS talk to people in words, as noted earlier [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1757/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1637" target=_top>1637</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1757/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1638" target=_top>1638</a>]. They talk to each other in thoughts, however, which are the source of words and which combine to form whole concepts. The individual thoughts are not as dim and vague as they are in people still living in their bodies but are as sharp and clear as [the words] of speech.<br />Our thinking becomes more distinct and clearer after the body is discarded, and each thought then separates out to serve as a discrete unit of speech. Darkness dissolves with the body, freeing the mind of the fetters that bind it and so of the fog that envelops it. Our thinking becomes more spontaneous, and as a result we more readily see, grasp, and vocalize specific ideas. </p>

CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE SPEECH OF SPIRITS, AND ITS DIVERSITIES. The speech of spirits with man, as before said, is effected by words; but the speech of spirits among themselves, by ideas-the origins 
of words-such as are the ideas of thought; these however are not so obscure as are man's ideas while he lives in the body, but are distinct, like those of speech. Human thought, after the decease 
of the body, becomes more distinct and clear; and the ideas of thought become discrete, so as to serve for distinct forms of speech; for obscurity has been dissipated together with the body; and so the 
thought-being liberated from the shackles in which it was as it were entangled, and consequently from the shade in which it was involved-becomes more instantaneous; and hence the mental view, perception, 
and utterance of each thing is more prompt. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1757</b></p><p><b>1757.</b>
THE SPEECH OF SPIRITS, AND ITS VARIATIONS - continued </p>
<p>As stated already, the speech of spirits with man is effected by means of words, whereas the speech of spirits among themselves 
is effected by means of ideas - the first origins of words - such as comprise thought. Those ideas however are not so obscure as man's ideas while he is living in the body, but are distinct and 
separate, like those that compose speech. Following the decease of the body human thought becomes more distinct and clear, and the ideas comprising thought become discrete and separate, so that they 
come to serve as distinct speech-forms; for obscurity has been dispelled together with the body, and thus thought, now freed, so to speak, from the shackles by which it was held, and therefore from the 
shades that enveloped it, becomes more spontaneous. As a consequence, insight into every specific idea, and the perception and utterance of it, become more immediate. </p>

Continuatio de Loquela spirituum, et Diversitatibus ejus </p>
<p>LOQUELA spirituum cum homine, ut prius dictum, fit per voces; sed loquela spirituum inter se per ideas, originarias vocum, quales sunt cogitationis, 
sed non ita obscurae ut sunt hominis dum vivit in corpore, verum distinctae sicut sunt loquelae.  Cogitatio humana post corporis secessum fit distinctior et clarior, et ideae cogitationis fiunt 
discretae ita ut pro formis loquelae distinctis inserviant; obscurum enim cum corpore dissipatum est, et sic cogitatio a suis quasi pedicis quibus irretita, proinde ab umbris quibus involuta, liberata, 
fit momentanea magis, inde praesentior singularium intuitio,, apperceptio, et enuntiatio. </p>
