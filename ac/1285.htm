<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1285节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1285.</strong>“那时全地只有一样的口音”表各地的人民总体上都持守一样的教义。这从稍后论述的圣言中“嘴唇（口音）”的含义清楚可知。本节用这几句话描述了古教会原来的状态，也就是说，它总体上有一种教义；但下一节描述了它如何开始被歪曲和篡改；由此到第九节，则描述了它全然败坏，以致不再有任何内在敬拜可言。紧接着论述的主题是由希伯开始的第二代古教会；最后论述的是第三代古教会，也就是犹太教会的开始。因为洪水后相继有三个教会。<br />至于第一代古教会，尽管它分布甚广，遍及全世界，但它的口音是一样的，它的话语也是一样的，也就是说，它共享一种教义，无论总体还是细节；而它的敬拜，无论内在还是外在，处处具有多样性，如前一章所述，那里说明了，所提到的各个民族表示各种不同的教义和仪式。情况是这样：天堂有无数社群，它们各不相同，然而却是一体，因为所有人都作为一体被主引领（对此，参看<a href="457.htm">457</a>，<a href="551.htm">551</a>，<a href="684.htm">684</a>，<a href="685.htm">685</a>，<a href="690.htm">690</a>节）。类似现象也存在于人里面，因为尽管他里面有众多脏腑、脏腑中的众多小脏腑、器官和肢体，其中每一个都以不同方式发挥作用，然而全部及每一个都作为一体由一个灵魂来支配。人体也具有类似现象，其中力量和活动的动作各不相同，然而全部由心脏的一个运动和肺脏的一个运动来支配，并构成一体。它们能以这种方式行如一体，其原因在于，天堂只有一个流注，每个个体皆照自己的天性接受这流注。该流注是情感的流注，来自主、祂的怜悯和生命。尽管只有一个流注，然而所有事物作为一体顺应和遵从。这是天堂中人所共享的相爱的结果。<br />第一代古教会的情形就是这样；因为尽管敬拜的种类有很多（有的是内在的，有的是外在的），总体上和所存在的民族一样多，具体地和构成民族的宗族一样多，细节上和教会中人一样多，然而它们全都有“一样的口音、一样的话语”；也就是说，它们全都有一种教义，无论总体还是细节。当所有人拥有相爱或仁爱时，教义就是一种。相爱或仁爱使他们全都合为一体，尽管他们具有多样性，因为他们出于多样性而构成一体。所有人，无论他们有多少，哪怕不计其数，倘若处于仁爱或相爱，就会有一个目的，即共同利益、主的国和主自己。教义和敬拜事务上的多样性如同人的感官和脏腑的多样性，如前所述，它们有助于整体的完善。事实上，主经由仁爱照着每个人的天性，以各种不同的方式流入和作工。祂就这样在地上如在天上那样，将所有人整理得井然有序，无论总体还是细节。主的意愿就是这样成就的，如祂亲自所教导的，“行在地上如同行在天上”。</p>

Cooper(2008,2013)</b></p>
<p><strong>[NCE]1285.</strong> The meaning of the whole earth had one language as the fact that a single broad view of doctrine existed everywhere can be seen from the symbolism of a language [or lip] in the Word (to be discussed just below).<br />This verse, in just a few words, describes what conditions had been like in the ancient church, in that it had held a single overall view of doctrine. The next verse portrays the commencement of falsification and adulteration, and the following verses up to verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1285/bible_king-james-version_genesis_11_9" target=_top>9</a> tell how the church became thoroughly corrupt, so that it no longer had any internal worship. Directly afterward, the text takes up the second ancient church, started by Eber, and eventually it turns to the third ancient church, which was the beginning of the Jewish religion. (Three churches came in a row after the Flood.)<br />[2] The first ancient church had one language and the same words — that is, a doctrinal view that was united in both its general and its particular tenets — despite its broad spread throughout the globe. It displayed this unity even though its forms of worship, both deep and shallow, differed everywhere, as the last chapter showed. (Each nation mentioned there symbolized a different doctrinal position and a different style of ritual.){*1} As far as that church and its unity is concerned, the situation is this:<br />Heaven contains a countless number of communities, each of them different but still united, because the Lord leads them all as one. (For more on this, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1285/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_457" target=_top>457</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1285/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_551" target=_top>551</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1285/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_684" target=_top>684</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1285/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_685" target=_top>685</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1285/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_690" target=_top>690</a>.) It resembles a human being, in whom all the elements without exception are regulated as a single whole, by a single soul, despite the vast number of organs and of component parts to the organs, viscera, and limbs, each component acting in a different way from the next. Or it is like the human body, in which all the activities of force and motion, though unlike, are still regulated by a single motion of the heart and a single motion of the lungs, and in which they still form a unified whole.<br />The reason they are able to act as one in this way is that heaven has a single stream of influence, which each individual receives according to his or her own character. (The stream of influence consists of the emotional effect that the Lord in all his mercy and vital energy has on us.) Even though there is a single stream [received in different ways], all things obey and yield to it as a united whole. This is the result of the love that heaven's inhabitants share.<br />[3] Such was the case with the first ancient church. There were as many general categories of inner and outer worship in it as there were nations, as many subcategories as clans in the nations, and as many specific types as there were people in the church. Yet they all had one language and the same words, which is to say that they all had one doctrinal view in general and particular.<br />A doctrinal view is united when everyone loves each other, or displays charity. Mutual love and charity bring such people together into one despite the variety among them, because it draws unity out of variety. When everyone practices charity, or loves each other, then no matter how many people there are — even if they number in the hundreds of millions — they share a single goal: the common good, the Lord's kingdom, and the Lord himself. Variety in doctrine and worship are, again, like the variety of senses and organs in the human body, which contribute to the perfection of the whole. When doctrine or worship varies, then the Lord, working by means of charity, affects and acts on each of us in a way uniquely suited to our personality. In this way he fits each and every one of us into the order of things, on earth just as in heaven. Then, as the Lord himself teaches [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1285/bible_king-james-version_matthew_6_10" target=_top>Matthew 6:10</a>], his will is done on earth as it is in heaven.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg provides an overview of this symbolism in the summary portion of chapter <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1285/bible_king-james-version_genesis_10_1-32" target=_top>10</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1285/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1130" target=_top>1130-1138</a>.

The whole earth was of one lip. That this signifies that everywhere there was one doctrine in general, is evident from the signification of "lip," in the Word, concerning which presently. In this verse, 
and by these few words, is described the state of the Ancient Church as it had been, that it had one doctrine in general; but in the following verse it is described how it began to be falsified and 
adulterated; and from that to the ninth verse, how it became altogether perverted, so that it no longer had any internal worship. Then, a little further on, the subject treated of is the second Ancient 
Church, that was begun by Eber; and, finally, the third Ancient Church, which was the beginning of the Jewish Church. For after the flood there were three churches in succession.  [2] As regards 
the first Ancient Church, in that although it was so widely spread over the earth it was still one in lip and one in words, that is, one in doctrine in general and in particular, when yet its worship 
both internal and external was everywhere different-as shown in the preceding chapter, where by each nation there named a different doctrinal and ritual were signified-the case is this. In heaven there 
are innumerable societies, and all different, and yet they are a one, for they are all led as a one by the Lord, concerning which see what has been said before (n. 457, 551, 684, 685, 690). In this 
respect the case is the same as it is with man, in whom, although there are so many viscera, and so many little viscera within the viscera, organs, and members, each one of which acts in a different way, 
yet all and each are governed as a one, by the one soul; or as it is with the body, wherein the activities of the powers and motions are different, yet all are governed by one motion of the heart 
and one motion of the lungs, and make a one. That these can thus act as a one, comes from the fact that in heaven there is one single influx, which is received by every individual in accordance with his 
own genius; and which influx is an influx of affections from the Lord, from His mercy, and from His life; and notwithstanding that there is only one single influx, yet all things obey and follow as 
a one.* This is the result of the mutual love in which are they who are in heaven. [3] The case was the same in the first Ancient Church; for although there were as many kinds of worship-some being 
internal and some external-as in general there were nations, and as many specifically as there were families in the nations, and as many in particular as there were men of the church, yet they all had 
one lip and were one in words; that is, they all had one doctrine, both in general and in particular. The doctrine is one when all are in mutual love, or in charity. Mutual love and charity cause them 
all to be a one, although they are diverse, for they make a one out of the varieties. All men how many soever they may be, even myriads of myriads, if they are in charity or mutual love, have one end, 
namely, the common good, the Lord's kingdom, and the Lord Himself. Varieties in matters of doctrine and of worship are like the varieties of the senses and of the viscera in man, as has been said, 
which contribute to the perfection of the whole. For then, through charity, the Lord inflows and works in diverse ways, in accordance with the genius of each one; and thus, both in general and in particular, 
disposes all into order, on earth as in heaven. And then the will of the Lord is done, as He Himself teaches, as in the heavens, so also upon the earth. * That is, in spite of their immense variety, 
and the consequent stupendous diversity of their reception of that one single influx. [Reviser.] </p>

That 'the whole earth was one lip' means that people everywhere held to the same doctrine in its general aspects is clear from the meaning in the Word of 'a lip', dealt with in the next paragraph. This 
verse, in these few words, describes the state of the Ancient Church as it had been, that is to say, it held to the same general doctrine. The next verse however describes how it began to be falsified 
and adulterated, and after that down to verse 9 how it became so utterly perverted that no internal worship existed any longer. Immediately after that the subject is the second Ancient Church begun 
by Eber, and at last the third Church which was the start of the Jewish Church. For after the Flood there were three consecutive Churches. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In regard to what has been said of the first Ancient 
Church - that though so wide-spread throughout the world, its lip was nevertheless one and its words one, that is, it shared one doctrine in its general aspects and in its particular details; but for 
all that, the forms of worship, internal as well as external, were everywhere divergent, as shown in the previous chapter where each nation that is mentioned meant a divergent form of doctrine and of 
ritual - the situation is as follows: Heaven consists of countless communities. They all vary, and yet all are one, for all are led as one by the Lord; see what has appeared already in <a href="457.htm">457</a>, <a href="551.htm">551</a>, <a href="684.htm">684</a>, <a href="685.htm">685</a>, <a href="690.htm">690</a>. A parallel exists in man, in that although internally his body has so many parts, which, like his other organs and limbs, have so many inner parts, each functioning differently from any other, 
yet all of them, every single one, are nevertheless controlled as one by one soul. A parallel also exists with the human body, which has different ways of exerting its strength and of moving. Nevertheless 
all are controlled by one motion of the heart and one of the lungs, and together make one. The reason they are able to function as one in this way is that in heaven there is one single influx 
which is received by everyone according to his own disposition. This influx is an influx of affections from the Lord, from His mercy and life. And although there is one influx only, everything nevertheless 
conforms and follows as one. And this comes about through the mutual love shared by those in heaven. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Such was the situation with the first Ancient Church that although there were so many 
forms of internal and external worship, at the general level as many as there were nations, at the specific level as many as there were families making up nations, and at the particular level as many 
as there were people in the Church, they all nevertheless had 'one lip' and 'their words were one'; that is, they all shared one doctrine in general and in particular. Doctrine is one when all possess 
mutual love, or charity. Mutual love or charity causes things, though varied, to be one, for it makes one out of varied things. If all, no matter how many - even ten thousand times ten thousand - are 
governed by charity or mutual love, they have but one end in view, namely the common good, the Lord's kingdom, and the Lord Himself. Variations in matters of doctrine and in forms of worship are like 
the variations that exist with the physical senses and with the inner parts of man's body, which, as stated, all contribute to the perfection of the whole. Indeed the Lord flows in and works by way 
of charity though in different ways according to the disposition of each individual. And in so doing He arranges every single person into a proper order, on earth as in heaven. In this way the Lord's 
will is done, as He Himself teaches, 'on earth as it is in heaven'. </p>

Quod 'fuit tota terra labium unum' significet quod ubivis una doctrina in communi, constat a significatione 'labii' in Verbo, de qua in mox sequentibus. In hoc versu et per pauca haec verba describitur 
status Ecclesiae Antiquae qualis fuerat, quod nempe una doctrina in genere; at in sequente versu describitur quomodo falsificari et adulterari coeptum; et dein usque ad vers. 9, quomodo prorsus perversa 
facta sit ut non amplius cultus internus. Agitur mox dein de altera Ecclesia Antiqua incepta ab Ebero; et tandem de tertia quae fuit initium Ecclesiae Judaicae; nam post diluvium tres Ecclesiae 
successive fuerunt.  [2] Quod primam Antiquam Ecclesiam attinet, quod in illa, tametsi ita late per orbem diffusa, usque fuerit unum labium et una verba, hoc est, una doctrina in communi et in particulari, 
cum tamen cultus tam interni quam externi ubivis diversi, sicut ostensum in capite praecedente, ubi per unamquamvis gentem ibi nominatam significatum est doctrinale et rituale diversum, ita se 
res habet: in caelo sunt societates innumerabiles, et omnes variae, sed usque unum, nam omnes ut unum ducuntur a Domino, de quo videantur quae prius n. 457, 551, 684, 685, 690; et se habet sicut homo, 
in quo tametsi tot viscera, et tot viscerula intra viscera, organa et membra, quorum unum diversimode agit ac alterum, usque omnia et singula, ut unum, ab una anima reguntur: aut sicut corpus in quo 
virium et motuum activitates diversae, usque omnes ab unico cordis et unico pulmonis motu reguntur, et unum faciunt: quod haec ita unum agere possint exinde est quod in caelo sit unicus influxus, qui 
recipitur ab unoquovis secundum ejus genium, qui influxus est affectionum a Domino, Ipsius Misericordia et Vita; et tametsi influxus unicus est, usque omnia parent et sequuntur sicut unum; et hoc per 
amorem mutuum in quo sunt qui in caelo: [3] ita se habuit cum Ecclesia Antiqua prima tametsi tot cultus fuerunt interni et externi, in genere quot gentes, specie quot gentium familiae, et in particulari 
quot homines Ecclesia usque unum omnibus labium et una verba, hoc est, omnibus una doctrina in communi et particulari; una doctrina est cum omnibus amor mutuus seu charitas; amor mutuus et charitas 
facit ut unum sint, tametsi varia, nam ex variis unum facit, omnes quotcumque sunt, si vel myriadum myriades, si in charitate seu amore mutuo sunt, unum finem habent, nempe commune bonum, regnum Domini, 
Ipsum Dominum; varietates doctrinalium et cultuum sunt sic varietates sensuum et viscerum in homine, ut dictum, quae contribuunt ad perfectionem totius; Dominus enim tunc per charitatem diversimode 
secundum cujusvis genium influit et operatur, et sic disponit omnes et singulos in ordinem, ita in terra sicut in caelo, et 'fit tunc Domini voluntas,' ut Dominus Ipse docet, 'in terris sicut in caelis.' </p>
