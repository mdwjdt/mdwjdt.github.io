<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3637节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3637.</strong>相对人来说，大人是主的整个天堂；但从至高意义上说，大人就是主自己；因为天堂来自祂，其中的一切事物都与祂相对应。由于人类因着邪恶的生活和由此而来的虚假说服已经全然败坏，还由于那时人所具有的低级事物开始掌控高级事物，或他的属世之物掌控属灵之物，导致耶和华或主无法再经由大人，也就是天堂流入进来，将这些事物带入适当次序，所以主有必要降世。祂由此可以披上一个人身，并使其变成神性，然后藉着这变成神性的人身恢复秩序，好让整个天堂视祂为独一无二的人，并唯独与祂对应；那些处于邪恶并由此处于虚假的人则被踩到脚下，从而被扔到这个大人外面。这解释了为何天上的人被说成是在主里面，甚至在祂的身体里面；因为主是天堂的全部，每一个天使因在祂里面而有一个指定的具体领域和职能。</p>

Relatively to man, the Grand Man is the Lord's universal heaven; but in the supreme sense the Grand Man is the Lord alone, for heaven is from Him, and all things therein correspond to Him. Inasmuch as 
by a life of evil and the consequent persuasions of falsity, the human race had become altogether perverted, and as the lower things with man then began to dominate over the higher, or his natural things 
over the spiritual, so that Jehovah or the Lord could no longer flow in through the Grand Man, that is heaven, and reduce them into order, there was a consequent necessity for the coming of the 
Lord into the world, that thereby He might put on the human, and make it Divine, and by it restore order, so that the universal heaven might have relation to Him as the Only Man, and might correspond 
to Him alone; those who were in evil and thence in falsity being rejected beneath the feet, thus out of the Grand Man. Hence they who are in the heavens are said to be in the Lord, even in His Body; for 
the Lord is the all of heaven, in whom all and each are assigned their provinces and offices. </p>

In relation to man the Grand Man is the whole of the Lord's heaven, but in the highest sense the Grand Man is the Lord Himself; for it is from Him that heaven has its being, and to Him everything there 
corresponds. Since the human race had become utterly corrupted on account of a life of evil and consequent false persuasions, and since at that time the lower things with man were beginning to take 
control over the higher, that is, natural things were taking control over spiritual, and as a result Jehovah or the Lord was no longer able to flow in by way of the Grand Man, that is, by way of heaven, 
and bring those things back into proper order, it was consequently necessary for the Lord to come into the world. It was necessary because in so doing He assumed a human and made this Divine. Then 
by means of that human made Divine He restored order so that the whole of heaven might have reference to Himself as the one and only Man and might correspond to Him alone, once those who were under the 
influence of evil and so of falsity had been trodden down and so cast outside the Grand Man. This explains why people in heaven are said to be 'in the Lord', indeed in His body; for the Lord is the 
All of heaven, and being in Him every single angel there is assigned to a particular province and function. </p>

Maximus Homo est universum Domini caelum respective ad hominem, sed Maximus Homo in supremo sensu est Solus Dominus, ex Ipso enim {1}caelum, et Ipsi correspondent omnia ibi.  Quia humanum genus per vitam 
mali et inde persuasiones falsi prorsus perversum factum erat, et quia tunc apud hominem inferiora incipiebant dominari super ejus superiora, seu naturalia super ejus spiritualia, ita ut non amplius 
Jehovah seu Dominus per Maximum Hominem, hoc est, caelum, influere et illa in ordinem redigere posset, inde necessitas Adventus Domini in mundum ut sic indueret humanum, et id Divinum faceret, et 
per id restitueret ordinem, ut ad Ipsum ut ad unicum Hominem universum caelum se referret, et Ipsi Soli corresponderet, rejectis illis qui in malo et inde in falso essent, sub pedes, ita extra Maximum 
Hominem. Inde illi qui in caelis sunt, dicuntur in Domino esse, immo in Ipsius corpore, nam Dominus est omne caeli, in Quo omnes et singuli ibi sortiuntur provincias et munia. @1 i est$ </p>
