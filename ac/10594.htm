<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10594节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10594</strong>.在来世，人的灵在一个人的形式里面显现，和世上所看到一个人一样。他也享有视觉、听觉、语言和感觉能力，和在世时一样，并拥有思考、意愿、行动的全部能力，也和在世时一样。简言之，他方方面面都是一个人，只是他不再拥有在世上包裹他的粗糙身体。他死亡时就丢下这身体，并永远不再披上它。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 10594</b></p><p><b>10594.</b>
In the other life the spirit of man appears in the human form absolutely as in the world. He also enjoys the capability of seeing, of hearing, of speaking, and of feeling, as in the world; and is endowed 
with every capability of thinking, of willing, and of acting, as in the world. In a word, he is a man in respect to each and all things, except that he is not encompassed with that gross body with 
which he was encompassed in the world. This he leaves behind when he dies, nor does he ever resume it. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10594</b></p><p><b>10594.</b>
A person's spirit is seen in the next life within a human form, exactly as that person was seen in the world. The person is also endowed with the powers of sight, hearing, speech, and feeling, as he 
was in the world, and possesses the full ability to think, will, and act, as he did in the world. In short, he is a human being in every single respect except that he no longer has the coarse body which 
clothed him in the world. This he leaves behind when he dies and never takes it up again.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 10594</b>
</p><b>10594.</b>
Spiritus hominis apparet in altera vita in forma humana prorsus sicut in mundo; gaudet etiam facultate videndi, audiendi, loquendi, sentiendique sicut in mundo; et pollet omni facultate cogitandi, volendi, 
et faciendi sicut in mundo; verbo, est homo quoad omnia et singula, praeter quod non crasso illo corpore quo in mundo circumdatus sit; id relinquit cum moritur, nec usquam resumit. </p>
