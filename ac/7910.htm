<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7910节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7910.</strong>“在你们一切住处要吃无酵饼”表在他们的内层，凡良善所在之处，真理必变成他们自己的。这从“住处”和“吃无酵饼”的含义清楚可知：“住处”是指心智的部分，因而是指聪明和智慧的各个方面（参看<a href="7719.htm">7719</a>节），进而是指内层，因为聪明和智慧就居于内层，良善也居于内层；“吃无酵饼”是指将真理变成自己的，如前面几次所说到的。至于人的内层是他们将事物归与自己的地方，也是良善所在之处的事实，要知道，对那些在主里面，也就是过着信与仁的生活之人来说，良善就居于他们的内层；它越深地居于它们里面，这良善就越纯粹，越是天上的。但真理居于他们的外层，并且它外在地居于它们里面，真理就越丧失良善。原因在于，就其内层而言，人就在天堂，但就其外层而言，他在世界。正因如此，信之真理通过一种外在途径进入，而良善则通过一种内在途径进入（<a href="7756.htm">7756</a>，<a href="7757.htm">7757</a>节）；也正因如此，人的内层，就是良善所在的地方，就是他们将真理变成自己的，或归与自己的地方。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7910</b></p><p><b>7910.</b>
In all your dwellings ye shall eat things unleavened. That this signifies that in the interiors, where good is, truth shall be appropriated, is evident from the signification of "dwellings," as being 
the things which are of the mind, thus which are of intelligence and wisdom (see n. 7719), consequently the interiors, for here are intelligence and wisdom, and good also; and from the signification 
of "eating unleavened things," as being to appropriate truth to oneself (of which several times above). As to appropriation being effected in the interiors, and good being there, be it known that with 
those who are in the Lord, that is, who are in the life of faith and charity, good dwells in the interiors, and the more interiorly it dwells with them, the purer and the more heavenly the good is; but 
truth dwells in the exteriors, and the more exteriorly it dwells with them, the more is truth widowed from good. The reason is that man as to his interiors is in heaven, and as to his inmosts is near 
the Lord, but as to exteriors he is in the world; and hence it is that the truths which are of faith enter by an external way, but good by an internal way (n. 7756, 7757), also that the appropriation 
of truth is effected in the interiors where good is. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7910</b></p><p><b>7910.</b>
'In all your dwellings you shall eat unleavened bread' means that in their interiors, where good is, truth must be made their own. This is clear from the meaning of dwellings' as parts of the mind, thus 
aspects of intelligence and wisdom, dealt with in <a href="7719.htm">7719</a>, consequently the interiors since intelligence and wisdom reside there, and also good; and from the meaning of 'eating unleavened bread' as making 
truth one's own, dealt with several times above. As regards the fact that people's interiors are the place where they make things their own, and the fact that the interiors are where good is, it 
should be recognized that with those who rely on the Lord, that is, who lead a life of faith and charity, good resides in their interiors; and the more deeply it resides in them, the purer and more heavenly 
that good is. But in their exteriors truth resides; and the more external its seat is, the more bereft of good that truth is. The reason for this is that so far as his interiors are concerned 
a person is in heaven, the innermost of them being close to the Lord; but so far as his exteriors are concerned he is in the world. Thus it is that the truths of faith enter by an external route, but 
good by an internal one, <a href="7756.htm">7756</a>, <a href="7757.htm">7757</a>, and thus it also is that people's interiors, where good is, are the place where they make truth their own. </p>

`In omnibus habitationibus vestris comedetis azyma': quod significet quod in interioribus ubi bonum, appropriabitur verum, constat a significatione `habitationum' quod sint illa quae mentis sunt, ita 
quae intelligentiae et sapientiae, de qua n. 7719, consequenter interiora, nam ibi intelligentia et sapientia, et quoque ibi bonum; et ex significatione `comedere azyma' quod sit appropriare sibi verum, 
de qua supra aliquoties.  Quod appropriatio fiat in interioribus, {1}et quod ibi bonum, sciendum quod apud illos qui in Domino sunt, hoc est, qui in {2}vita fidei et charitatis, bonum habitet in 
interioribus, et quo interius apud illos eo purius et caelestius bonum; at in exterioribus habitat verum, quoque exterius apud illos eo verum est magis viduatum bono; causa est quia homo quoad interiora 
sua est in caelo, et quoad intima sua est prope Dominum, at quoad exteriora est in mundo; {3}inde est quod vera quae fidei intrent per viam externam, bonum autem per internam, n. 7756, 7757; tum quod 
appropriatio veri fiat in interioribus ubi bonum 	@1 ubi$ 	@2 charitate et fide$ 	@3 et quoad maxime externa remotus a coelo; inde est quod non dari queat fides apud hominem, nisi vera quae fidei 
intrant per viam externam seu per auditum hominis, et quoque inde conjunctio fiat in interioribus ejus, ubi bonum; bonum autem quod charitatis intrat per viam internam seu per animam, videatur n. 7756, 7757$ </p>
