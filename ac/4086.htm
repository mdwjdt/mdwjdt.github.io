<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4086节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4086.</strong>“他说，你举目”表出于祂自己之物的洞察。这从“举目”的含义清楚可知，“举目”是指思考并集中注意力（参看<a href="2789.htm">2789</a>，<a href="2829.htm">2829</a>节），因而是指洞察。此处这种洞察是从祂自己之物中得来的，这一点从经上说“举目观看”，以及思路明显看出来。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4086</b></p><p><b>4086.</b>
And he said, Lift up I pray thine eyes. That this signifies attention thereto from that which was His own, is evident from the signification of "lifting up the eyes," as being to think and intend (see 
n. 2789, 2829), and thus to attend to. That here the signification is that which was from His own, is manifest from its being said, "Lift up thine eyes and see" and also from the series. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4086</b></p><p><b>4086.</b>
'And he said, Lift up now your eyes' means observation from what was His own. This is clear from the meaning of 'lifting up the eyes' as thinking and directing one's attention, dealt with in <a href="2789.htm">2789</a>, <a href="2829.htm">2829</a>, 
and so as observing. The fact that in this case such observation was made from what was His own is evident from the use of the words 'lift up your eyes and see', as well as from the train of thought. </p>

</p><b>4086.</b>
`Et dixit, Tolle quaeso oculos tuos': quod significet advertentiam ex proprio, constat ex significatione `tollere oculos' quod sit cogitare et intendere, de qua n. 2789, 2829, ita advertere; hic 
quod ex proprio, patet ex eo quod dicatur `tolle oculos et vide,' tum a serie. </p>
