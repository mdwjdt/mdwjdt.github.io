<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2001节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2001.</strong>之所以采用“神”这个词，是因为亚伯兰所敬拜的沙代神代表主，还因为论述的主题是要与良善联结的真理。这从前面所述明显可知。在圣言中，主有时被称为耶和华（Jehovah），有时被称为耶和华神（Jehovah God），有时被称为主耶和华（Lord Jehovih），在内义上总有一个隐藏的原因。当论述的主题是爱或善，或属天教会时，就用耶和华（JEHOVAH）这个名；但当论述的主题是信或真理，或属灵教会时，就用神。这种情况很常见，原因在于，主的存在本身由爱构成，源于爱的存在则由信构成（<a href="709.htm">709</a>，<a href="732.htm">732</a>节）。主在此之所以被称为“神”，是因为论述的主题是要与良善联结的真理。另外一个原因是，主愿意由亚伯兰所敬拜的沙代神来代表，鉴于此，下文仍沿用神这个名。因为在本章，祂只有一次被称为“耶和华”，却数次被称为“神”（如<a href="http://39-27.cn/创17.7.htm">17:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创17.8.htm">8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创17.15.htm">15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创17.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创17.19.htm">19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创17.22.htm">22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创17.23.htm">23</a>）。</p>

That the expression "God" is used for the reason that the Lord is represented by the God Shaddai whom Abram worshiped, and also because truth is treated of, which was to be united to good, is evident 
from what has been said before. In the Word the Lord is sometimes called "Jehovah," sometimes "Jehovah God," also the "Lord Jehovih," and sometimes "God," and always for a secret reason in the internal 
sense. Where love or good; and the celestial church, are treated of, He is called "JEHOVAH;" but when faith or truth, and the spiritual church, are treated of, He is called "God," and this constantly; 
and the reason is, that the Lord's very Being itself is of love, and the Being thence derived is of faith (n. 709, 732). Here therefore the Lord is called "God," because the truth which is to be united 
to good is treated of. Another reason is that the Lord willed to be represented by the God Shaddai that Abram worshiped, on which account the name God is retained in what follows; for in this chapter 
He is called "Jehovah" only once, and "God" several times (as in verses 7-8, 15, 18-19, 22-23). </p>

The name 'God' is used because God Shaddai whom Abram worshipped represents the Lord, and also because truth that was to be united to good is the subject. This is evident from what has been stated already. 
In the Word the Lord is sometimes called Jehovah, sometimes Jehovah God, also the Lord Jehovih, and sometimes God; and there is always a hidden reason for this in the internal sense. When love 
or good is the subject, or the celestial Church, the name JEHOVAH is used, but when faith or truth is the subject, or the spiritual Church, GOD is used. This is invariably so, the reason being that the 
Lord's actual Being (Esse) consists of love, and the Being (Esse) emanating from it consists of faith, <a href="709.htm">709</a>, <a href="732.htm">732</a>. Here therefore God is used because the subject is truth that was to be united to good. 
A second reason here is that the Lord was willing to be represented as the god Shaddai, whom Abram worshipped. This is why the name God is retained in what follows, for in this chapter the name Jehovah 
is mentioned only once but God several times, as in verses 7, 8, 15, 18, 19, 22, 23. </p>

Quod `Deus' dicatur quia per `Deum Shaddai' quem Abramus coluit, repraesentatur Dominus, tum quia de vero agitur quod uniendum bono, patet ab illis quae prius dicta sunt: in Verbo Dominus aliquoties 
nominatur Jehovah, aliquoties (o)Jehovah Deus, tum Dominus (x)Jehovih, aliquoties Deus, et hoc semper ex causa arcana in sensu interno; ubi de amore seu bono agitur, deque Ecclesia caelesti: `JEHOVAH' 
dicitur; at vero ubi de fide seu vero, deque Ecclesia spirituali, `DEUS' dicitur; et hoc constanter, ex causa quia ipsum Esse Domini est amoris, et Esse quod inde, est fidei, n. 709, 732; hic ideo Deus, 
quia de vero agitur, quod uniendum bono; altera causa hic est quod Dominus voluit repraesentari per deum Shaddai, quem Abramus coluit, quare nomen Deus {1} retinetur in sequentibus, nam in hoc capite 
modo semel nominatur Jehovah, et {2} aliquoties Deus, ut in vers. 7, 8, 15, 18, 19, 22, 23. 	@1 Dei.$ 	@2 at.$ </p>
