<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1703节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1703.</strong>当论及与某种服务形式有关的事物时，圣言就采用“希伯来”这个术语。这从以下经文明显看出来，摩西书：<br />你弟兄中，若有一个希伯来男人，或希伯来女人被卖给你，服事你六年，到第七年就要任他自由出去。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申15.12.htm">15:12</a>）<br />此处经上说“一个希伯来男人，或希伯来女人”，是因为论述的主题是服事。耶利米书：<br />你的一个希伯来弟兄若卖给你，服事你六年，到第七年你们各人就要任他自由出去。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶34.9.htm">34:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶34.14.htm">14</a>）<br />此处同样出现了“希伯来”这个名字，因为主题是服事，否则，雅各的子孙在先知书中的其它地方不会被称为“希伯来人”。撒母耳记：<br />非利士人说，要刚强，要作大丈夫，免得作希伯来人的奴仆，如同他们作你们的奴仆一样。（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上4.9.htm">4:9</a>）<br />此处的含义也一样。<br />摩西书：<br />耶和华对摩西说，你要到法老那里，对他说，耶和华希伯来人的神这样说：容我的百姓去，好事奉我。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出9.1.htm">9:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出9.13.htm">13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出10.3.htm">10:3</a>）<br />此处他们也是因事奉而被称为希伯来人。波提乏的妻子论到约瑟说：<br />她就叫了家里的人来，对他们说，看，他带了一个希伯来人到我们这里戏弄我们。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创39.14.htm">39:14</a>）<br />他被称为“一个希伯来人”，是因为他是那里的一个奴隶。酒政对法老说：<br />在那里同我们在一起的有一个希伯来的少年人，是护卫长的仆人，他就为我们解梦。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创41.12.htm">41:12</a>）<br />此外，埃及人将以色列人称为希伯来人，是因为他们是奴隶，或处于奴役状态，这从出埃及记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/出1.15.htm">1:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出1.16.htm">16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出1.19.htm">19</a>等）清楚可知。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1703.</strong> The following places show that the Word describes subservient things as Hebrews. In Moses:<br />When your Hebrew brother or sister is sold to you, that person shall also serve you six years, and in the seventh year you shall send him or her away free from beside you. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1703/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_15_12" target=_top>Deuteronomy 15:12</a>)<br />The word Hebrew is used here because the subject is slavery. In Jeremiah:<br />At the end of seven years, you shall each send away your Hebrew sister or brother who was sold to you and served you six years. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1703/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_34_9" target=_top>Jeremiah 34:9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1703/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_34_14" target=_top>14</a>)<br />Here too the word Hebrew is used because the subject is slavery. The children of Jacob are not called Hebrews anywhere else in the prophets. In Samuel:<br />The Philistines were saying, "Strengthen yourselves and turn into men or you will be slaves to the Hebrews as they were slaves to you." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1703/bible_king-james-version_1-samuel_4_9" target=_top>1 Samuel 4:9</a>)<br />The same is true here.<br />[2] In Moses:<br />Jehovah said to Moses, "Go in to Pharaoh, and you are to speak to him: ‘This is what Jehovah, God of the Hebrews, has said: "Send my people away so that they can serve me."'" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1703/bible_king-james-version_exodus_9_1" target=_top>Exodus 9:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1703/bible_king-james-version_exodus_9_13" target=_top>13</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1703/bible_king-james-version_exodus_10_3" target=_top>10:3</a>)<br />Here again it is because of their enslavement that they are called Hebrews. Potiphar's wife concerning Joseph:<br />She shouted out to the men of her household and said to them, "See? He has brought us a Hebrew man to mock us." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1703/bible_king-james-version_genesis_39_14" target=_top>Genesis 39:14</a>)<br />He is called a Hebrew because he was a slave there. The chief of the cup bearers said to Pharaoh:<br />With us was a young Hebrew man, the slave of the chief of the courtiers, and he interpreted our dreams for us. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1703/bible_king-james-version_genesis_41_12" target=_top>Genesis 41:12</a>)<br />In addition, Egyptians called the children of Israel Hebrews because they were slaves, or in servitude, as is known (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1703/bible_king-james-version_exodus_1_15-16" target=_top>Exodus 1:15-16</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1703/bible_king-james-version_exodus_1_19" target=_top>19</a>, and elsewhere). </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1703</b></p><p><b>1703.</b>
That the term "Hebrew" is predicated in the Word of some form of servitude, is evident from the following passages. In Moses: </p>
<p>     When thy brother, a Hebrew, or a Hebrewess, shall be sold unto thee, 
and serve thee six years, then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee (Deut. 15:12); </p>
<p>where it is said "a Hebrew" and "a Hebrewess," because servitude is treated of. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p> 
    At the end of seven years ye shall let go every man his brother that is a Hebrew, who hath been sold unto thee, and hath served thee six years (Jer. 34:9, 14); </p>
<p>where in like manner the term "Hebrew" 
is used, because servitude is treated of; otherwise the sons of Jacob are not in the Prophets called "Hebrews." In Samuel: </p>
<p>     The Philistines said, Be strong, and be men, that ye be not servants 
unto the Hebrews as they have been to you (1 Sam. 4:9); </p>
<p>where the word is used for the same reason.  [2] In Moses: </p>
<p>Jehovah said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus saith Jehovah, 
the God of the Hebrews, Let My people go, that they may serve Me (Exod. 9:1, 13; 10:3); </p>
<p>where they are called "Hebrews" from serving. The wife of Potiphar, speaking of Joseph: </p>
<p>     Called unto the 
men of her house, and said unto them, See, he hath brought in a Hebrew unto us to mock us (Gen. 39:14). Joseph is here called "a Hebrew" because he was a servant there. The chief of the butlers said 
unto Pharaoh: </p>
<p>     There was with us a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard, and he interpreted to us our dreams (Gen.  Moreover, the Egyptians called the sons of Israel "Hebrews," 
because they were servants, or in servitude, as is known (see Exod. 1:15-16, 19, and other places). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1703</b></p><p><b>1703.</b>
That the name 'a Hebrew' is used in the Word in reference to things which have to do with some form of service is clear from the following places: In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
When your brother, a Hebrew man or a Hebrew 
woman, is sold to you, and serves you for six years, then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2015:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 15:12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the expressions 'a Hebrew men' and 'a Hebrew women' are used 
because servitude is the subject. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
At the end of seven years you shall let go every man his brother that is a Hebrew who has been sold to you and has served you for six years. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2034:9,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 34:9, 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here similarly the name 'Hebrew' occurs because servitude is the subject, though the sons of Jacob are not called Hebrews in other places in the Prophets. In Samuel, </p>
<blockquote>
The Philistines said, 
Take heart and acquit yourselves like men, lest you be slaves to the Hebrews as they have served you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1%20Sam%204:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">1 Sam 4:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the meaning is similar. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh 
and say to him, Thus said Jehovah the God of the Hebrews, Let My people go so that they may serve Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%209:1,%2013;%2010:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 9:1, 13; 10:3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here too because of their servitude they were called Hebrews. Potiphar's 
wife referred to Joseph as a Hebrew, </p>
<blockquote>
She called to the men of her house, and said to them, See, he has brought us a Hebrew man to make sport of us. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2039:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 39:14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>He is called 'a Hebrew' because 
he was a slave there. The chief of the cup-bearers said to Pharaoh, </p>
<blockquote>
There was with us a Hebrew lad, a slave of the chief of the guards, and he interpreted our dreams to us. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2041:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 41:12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In addition 
the Egyptians called the children of Israel Hebrews, because they were slaves, or in slavery, as is well known from <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%201:15,%2016,%2019&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 1:15, 16, 19</a>, and elsewhere. </p>

</p><b>1703.</b>
Quod 'Hebraeus' in Verbo praedicetur de illis quae sunt alicujus servitii, constat a sequentibus locis; apud Mosen, 	Quando vendetur tibi frater tuus Hebraeus aut Hebraea, et serviet tibi sex annos, 
et in anno septimo dimittes eum liberum a tecum, Deut. xv 12; </p>
<p>ubi 'Hebraeus et Hebraea' dicitur quia de servitio agitur: apud Jeremiam, 	A fine septem annorum dimittetis quisque fratrem suum Hebraeum, 
qui venditus fuerit tibi, et serviverit tibi sex 	annos, xxxiv 9, 14; </p>
<p>ubi similiter 'Hebraeus' dicitur quia de servitio; alioquin filii Jacobi apud Prophetas non Hebraei vocantur: apud Samuelem, 	Philistaei 
dicebant, Confortamini et estote in viros, ne serviatis Hebraeis, sicut serviverunt vobis, 1 Sam. iv 9; </p>
<p>similiter: apud Mosen, 	Dixit Jehovah ad Mosen, Intra ad Pharaonem, et loquaris 
ad eum, Sic dixit Jehovah Deus Jehovah Deus Hebraeorum, Dimitte populum Meum, ut serviant Mihi, Exod. ix 1, 13; x 3; </p>
<p>ubi quoque ex servitio vocati sunt Hebraei: Potipharis uxor de Josepho, 	Clamavit 
ad viros domus suae, et dixit eis, Videte, adduxit nobis virum Hebraeum, ad illudendum nobis, Gen. xxxix 14; </p>
<p>'Hebraeus' dicitur quia ibi erat servus: princeps pincernarum a Pharaonem, 	Nobiscum erat 
puer Hebraeus, servus principis satellitum, et interpretatus est nobis somnia, Gen. xli 12: </p>
<p>et praeterea Aegyptii vocabant filios Israelis Hebraeos, quia erant servi seu in servitute, ut notum, Exod. 
i 15, 16, 19, et alibi. </p>
