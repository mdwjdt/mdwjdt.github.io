<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第571节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>571.</strong>当人将信之真理浸没于自己疯狂的欲望时，就亵渎了真理，并丧失自己的余留，尽管这余留仍存留在他们身上，却无法被带出来。因为一旦呈现出来，它们会再次被那些早被亵渎的东西所玷污。因为对圣言的亵渎会产生硬皮，它会导致堵塞，并吸收构成余留的良善与真理。因此，要让人谨防亵渎圣言，它包含内有生命的永恒真理，受虚假的设想影响之人并不相信它们就是真理。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]571.</strong> When we are such that we smother religious truth with our insane longings, we profane the truth and deprive ourselves of any remaining traces [of goodness or truth]. Although these traces stay with us, we cannot bring them to consciousness, since the moment we do so, we desecrate them once again with thoughts that are already defiled. Profanation of the Word creates a kind of callus that dams up all remaining goodness and truth and absorbs it. Be careful, then, not to desecrate the Lord's Word, which — although it is not seen as containing truth by anyone caught up in false assumptions — does contain eternal, living truth. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 571</b></p><p><b>571.</b>
When a man is of such a character that he immerses the truths of faith in his insane cupidities, he then profanes the truths, and deprives himself of remains, which although they remain cannot be brought 
forth, for as soon as they are brought forth they are again profaned by things that are profane for profanations of the Word produce as it were a callosity, which causes an obstruction, and absorbs 
the goods and truths of remains. Therefore let man beware of the profanation of the Word of the Lord, which contains the eternal truths wherein is life, although one who is in false principles does 
not believe that they are truths. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 571</b></p><p><b>571.</b>
When anyone is such that he immerses the truths of faith in his own insane desires he renders truths unholy and deprives himself of remnants which, though with him still, cannot be brought out. For the 
instant they are brought out they in turn are rendered unholy by those things which are already profaned. For profanations of the Word create hard skin so to speak which blocks and absorbs into itself 
the goods and truths constituting remnants. This being so, let man be on his guard against profaning the Word of the Lord in which eternal truths are present that have life within them, thought he 
person who is under the influence of false assumptions does not believe that they are truths.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 571</b>
</p><b>571.</b>
Cum homo talis est ut immergat vera fidei suis vesanis cupiditatibus, tunc profanat vera, et deprivat se reliquiis, quae tametsi manent, usque non possunt produci; nam ilico ut producuntur, ab iis quae 
profana sunt, iterum profanantur; nam profanationes Verbi faciunt quasi callum qui obstat, et qui absorbet bona et vera reliquiarum; quare caveat sibi homo a profanatione Verbi Domini: ubi, tametsi 
is qui in falsis principiis est, non credit quod veritates sint, usque sunt veritates aeternae, in quibus vita. </p>
