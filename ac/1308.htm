<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1308节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1308.</strong>“我们要为自己立名”表他们可以由此赢得权力的名声。这从“为自己立名”的含义清楚看出来。事实上，他们知道，人皆有进行某种敬拜的渴望，因为这种渴望是所有人都有的，存在于所有民族当中。凡观察宇宙，尤其思想宇宙秩序的人都承认某个至高无上的存在或实体。并且，由于他渴望自己的福祉，所以他将那个至高无上的存在作为自己崇拜的对象。此外，内在也有某种东西指示这一点，因为这种指示经由与每个人同在的天使从主那里流入。凡不是这种情况的人都在地狱灵的控制之下，并且不承认神。因建巴别塔的人十分清楚这一点，所以他们就利用教义和神圣事物为自己立名，否则，他们不会受到崇拜，这就是接下来经上所说“免得我们分散在全地面上”所表示的，也就是说他们得不到认可。由此还可知，这种人越是高昂起头，甚至升到天上，他们就越为自己立名。他们的统治权在那些有良知的人身上是最大的，因为他们可以随心所欲地领导这些人；至于那些没有良知的人，他们则利用各种外在束缚来统治他们。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1308.</strong> And let us make ourselves a name means so as to gain from this a reputation for power, as the symbolism of making a name for themselves shows.<br />They recognize, after all, that everyone wants to practice some kind of worship. This is a common trait, even among non-Christians. Everyone who contemplates the universe (and especially its order) acknowledges a supreme being, of course, and since we seek our own best welfare, we venerate that being. Besides, there is something inside that tells us to do so, because such a dictate flows in from the Lord by way of the angels present with each one of us. Anyone who does not sense that influence is under the domination of spirits in hell and fails to acknowledge God.<br />Since people who build Babylonian towers realize this, they make a name for themselves through doctrine and piety. Otherwise they would be unable to win the adulation of others. This is symbolized by the very next clause, that otherwise they would be "scattered over the face of the whole earth," or in other words, would not be acknowledged. From this it also follows that the higher into heaven such people can raise their heads, the more of a name they make for themselves.<br />Their domination is strongest with those who have a modicum of conscience, since they lead these people anywhere at will; but they have a plethora of external restraints for controlling those who lack conscience. </p>

And let us make us a name. That this signifies that thereby they might have a reputation for power, may be seen from the signification of "making oneself a name." For they knew that everyone desires 
to be in some worship; for this is common to all, and exists among all nations. For everyone who beholds the universe, and still more who considers the order of the universe, acknowledges some supreme 
being or entity [summum ens], and as he desires his own prosperity, he pays adoration to that entity. Moreover there is something within, which dictates this, for such a dictate flows in from the Lord 
through the angels who are with every man.  The man who is not like this, and who does not acknowledge a God, is under the dominion of infernal spirits. Knowing this, they who build Babylonish towers 
make themselves a name by means of doctrinal and holy things, for otherwise they could not be worshiped, which is signified in what next follows by their otherwise being scattered over the faces of 
the whole earth, that is, they would not be acknowledged. And from this it follows that the higher such men can lift up the head to heaven, the more they make themselves a name. Their dominion is greatest 
over those who have some conscience; for these they lead whithersoever they will; but as to those who have not conscience, they rule all such by means of various external bonds. </p>

'And let us make a name for ourselves' means that as a result they might gain a reputation for power. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'making a name for oneself' Indeed they know that everybody 
wishes to engage in worship of some kind, for that wish is common, existing even with every gentile. When anyone considers the universe' even more someone who considers the order of it, he acknowledges 
some supreme Being. And because he seeks his own welfare he offers that supreme Being his adoration. Furthermore there is something within which dictates this, for such an idea flows in from the Lord 
through the angels present with every individual. Anyone with whom this is not the case is under the control of spirits from hell, and does not acknowledge God. Because those who build towers of Babel 
know this they use matters of doctrine and holy things to make a name for themselves. Without that they could not be worshipped, which is the meaning of the statement coming next about their otherwise 
being scattered over the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the whole earth, that is, receiving no recognition. From this it also follows that the higher such people are able to rear their heads up into heaven, the more 
they make a name for themselves. Their dominion is greatest with people who have some conscience, for these they lead wherever they like. But those who have no conscience they govern by various external 
bonds.

</p><b>1308.</b>
'Et faciamus nobis nomen': quod significet ut inde fama potentiae, ex significatione 'nomen sibi faciendi' constare potest: norunt enim quod unusquisque in aliquo cultu esse velit; hoc enim commune 
est, etiam apud omnes gentes; quisque enim aliquod summum ens, cum spectat universum, et magis qui ordinem universi, agnoscit, et quia prosperitatem suam cupit, illud adorat; et praeterea est aliquod 
intus quod dictat, influit enim tale a Domino per angelos qui apud unumquemvis hominem; homo qui non talis est, is sub dominio spirituum infernalium est, nec agnoscit Deum: quia hoc norunt qui turres 
Babylonicas exstruunt, per doctrinalia et sancta 'faciunt sibi nomen,' alioquin non coli potuissent, quod in mox sequentibus significatur per id quod alioquin 'dispergerentur super facies totius terrae,' 
hoc est, quod non agnoscerentur; inde etiam sequitur, quo altius tales attollere possunt caput in caelum, eo plus nominis sibi faciunt: dominium eorum maximum est apud eos quibus aliquid conscientiae, 
nam eos ducunt quocumque; at vero quibus non conscientia, hos vinculis pluribus externis regunt. </p>
