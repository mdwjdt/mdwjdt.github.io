<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2706节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2706.</strong>“神与孩子同在”表主与属灵之人同在。这从“神与人同在”和“孩子”的含义清楚可知。“神与人同在”表主的临在，这是显而易见的，无需解释。事实上，主与每个人同在，因为生命并非来自其它源头。祂统治生命的每一个最小细节，甚至最坏之人的。哪怕在地狱本身中，祂也是如此统治。不过，主临在的性质因其生命被接受的方式而各异。对那些错误接受对主良善与真理之爱的生命，并将其转为对邪恶与虚假之爱的人来说，主是临在的，并尽可能将他们的目的折向良善。但主与他们的同在被视为“不在”，“不在”的程度取决邪恶与良善、虚假与真理的距离。然而，对那些接受对主良善与真理之爱的生命之人来说，祂被说成是临在的，临在的程度取决于接受的程度。主的临在好比太阳，这太阳照着对它的接受程度而以其热与光临在于一切植被的生命中。至于“孩子”表真理方面的属灵之物，这在前面已说明。不过，此处他表示那些属灵之人，因为他代表属灵教会成员，也代表属灵教会本身，并且在普遍意义上代表主的属灵国度。因为当说到人表属灵之物，如此处“孩子”表真理方面的属灵之物时，那些属灵之人也包括在这个意义中；因为属灵之物若没有一个主体是不存在的。这同样适用于抽象意义上所论及的一切其它事物。</p>

God was with the child. That this signifies the Lord's presence with the spiritual, is evident from the signification of "God being with" anyone, and from the signification of the "child." That "God 
being with" anyone signifies the Lord's presence, is evident without explication. The Lord is indeed present with everyone; for life is from no other source, and He governs the most minute things of it, 
even with the worst of men, and in hell itself; but in various ways according to the reception of life. With those who receive the life of the love of His good and truth in a wrong manner, and pervert 
it into loves of evil and falsity, the Lord is present, and overrules their ends as far as possible for good; but His presence with them is called absence, and indeed in the same degree in which evil 
is distant from good, and falsity from truth. But with those who receive the life of the love of the Lord's good and truth, He is said to be present, and indeed according to the degree of reception. 
It is with the Lord's presence as with that of the sun, which is present with its heat and light in the vegetation of the world also according to the reception.  That the "child" signifies the spiritual 
as to truth, has been said above; but here he signifies those who are spiritual because he represents the man of the spiritual church, and also the spiritual church itself, and in the universal 
sense the Lord's spiritual kingdom; for when it is said that anyone signifies what is spiritual, as here that "the child" signifies the spiritual as to truth, it involves that those are signified who 
are spiritual; for there is no spiritual without a subject. It is the same with all other things said in an abstract sense. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2706</b></p><p><b>2706.</b>
That 'God was with the boy' means the Lord's presence with those who are spiritual is clear from the meaning of 'God being with someone' and from the meaning of 'the boy'. </p>
<p>With regard to 'God's being 
with someone' meaning the Lord's presence, this may be seen without any explanation. The Lord is indeed present with everyone, for from no other source does life flow, and He governs every specific 
detail of it. This is so even with the worst of men, and in hell itself. But the nature of His presence varies according to the way His life is received. In the case of those who receive the life of 
the love of His good and truth wrongfully and who pervert it into the loves of what is evil and false, the Lord is present and as far as possible overrules for good their ends in view. But His presence 
with them is called 'absence' - an absence to the degree that evil is distant from good, and falsity from truth. With those however who do receive the life of the love of the Lord's good and truth 
it is referred to as 'presence', a presence to the degree of reception. The Lord's presence may be compared to the sun which is present with its heat and light in all plant life according to the reception 
of it. </p>
<p>With regard to 'the boy' meaning the spiritual as regards truth, this has been stated above. But here he means those who are spiritual because he represents the member of the spiritual 
Church, also the spiritual Church itself, and in the universal sense the Lord's spiritual kingdom. For when it is said that anyone means that which is spiritual, as here where 'the boy' means the spiritual 
as regards truth, those who are spiritual are included in the meaning, since the spiritual does not exist without a subject. The same applies to everything else spoken of in the abstracted sense. </p>

</p><b>2706.</b>
`Fuit Deus cum puero': quod significet praesentiam Domini apud spirituales, constat a significatione `esse Deus cum aliquo,' et a `pueri'; quod `esse Deus cum aliquo' significet praesentiam Domini, 
constare potest absque explicatione; praesens quidem est Dominus apud unumquemvis, nam aliunde non est vita, et singularissima ejus regit, etiam apud pessimos, inque ipso inferno sed diversimode secundum 
receptionem vitae {1}; qui vitam amoris boni et veri Ipsius recipiunt sinistre, et pervertunt in amores mali et falsi, est Dominus praesens, et regit fines eorum, quantum possibile {2} ad bonum, sed 
praesentia apud eos dicitur absentia, et quidem in tali gradu quo malum distat a bono, et falsum a vero: apud eos autem qui vitam amoris boni et veri Domini recipiunt, praedicatur praesentia et quidem 
secundum gradum receptionis: se habet hoc comparative sicut sol, qui praesens est calore et luce in vegetatis mundi etiam secundum receptionem.  Quod `puer' significet spirituale quoad verum, supra 
dictum est, hic spirituales quia repraesentat hominem Ecclesia spiritualis, tum ipsam Ecclesiam spiritualem, et in universali sensum regnum spirituale Domini; cum enim dicitur quod aliquis significer 
spirituale, ut hic `puer' spirituale quoad verum, involvit quod significer spirituales, nam spirituale non datur absque subjecto; ita quoque se habet cum reliquis quae dicuntur in sensu abstracto. 	@1 
A had apud eos here but deletes it.$ 	@2 A had est but d, I i comma.$ </p>
