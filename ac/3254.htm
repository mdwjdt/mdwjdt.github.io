<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3254节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3254.</strong>“亚伯拉罕寿高年迈，享尽天年”表代表的一个新状态。这从“寿高年迈”在内义上的含义清楚可知，“寿高年迈”是指脱去旧的，披上新的（参看<a href="1854.htm">1854</a>，<a href="2198.htm">2198</a>，<a href="3016.htm">3016</a>节）。就内义而言，“寿高年迈”之所以表示新的，或一个新状态，是因为圣言的内义是为天使存在的，而天使没有时间概念，因而没有属时间之物的概念，如人的各个年龄段，就是婴儿期、童年期、青春期、成年期和老年期。取而代之的是，他们具有状态的概念。因此：他们具有纯真状态的概念，而没有婴儿期的概念；具有良善与真理的情感状态的概念，而没有童年和青春期的概念；具有聪明状态的概念，而没有成年期的概念；具有智慧状态的概念（<a href="3183.htm">3183</a>节），而没有老年期的概念。由于死亡之时，人从属于时间的事物进入属于生命、没有时间的事物，并在此过程中取得一个新状态，故“寿高年迈”表示新的，在此表示一个新代表。因为“寿高年迈”，以及“享尽天年”与涉及亚伯拉罕的这个代表有关，这可从刚才所述清楚看出来。</p>

In a good old age, an old man and sated. That this signifies something new in the representation, is evident from the signification in the internal sense of "old age," as being to put off what is old 
and put on what is new (see n. 1854, 2198, 3016). The reason why what is new, or a new state, is signified in the internal sense by "old age," is that with the angels, for whom is the internal sense 
of the Word, there is no idea of time, thus no idea of such things as belong to time, as the ages of man-infancy, childhood, youth, adult age, and old age. But instead of all these they have an idea of 
states, thus instead of the time of infancy they have an idea of the state of innocence; instead of the time of childhood and youth they have an idea of the state of the affection of good and truth; 
instead of adult age they have an idea of the state of intelligence; and instead of old age an idea of the state of wisdom (n. 3183); and as at this time of life man passes from the things of time to 
those that are of a life without time, and thus puts on a new state, by "old age" is signified what is new, and in this case a new representative, because it is in relation to this with Abraham that 
"old age" is predicated, and also that he was "an old man and sated," as can be seen from what has just been said. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3254</b></p><p><b>3254.</b>
'In a good old age, an old man and full [of years]' means a new state of representation. This is clear from the meaning of 'old age' in the internal sense as laying aside the old and taking up the new, 
dealt with in <a href="1854.htm">1854</a>, <a href="2198.htm">2198</a>, <a href="3016.htm">3016</a>. The reason why that which is new, or a new state, is meant by 'old age' in the internal sense is that with angels for whose sake the internal sense of the Word exists 
there is no concept of time, and so no concept of things that belong to time, such as the ages of man, which are those of infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age. Instead of all these 
they have the concept of states - instead of the time of infancy they have the concept of the state of innocence; instead of the time of childhood and adolescence the concept of the state of affection 
for goodness and truth; instead of adulthood the concept of the state of intelligence; and instead of old age the concept of the state of wisdom, <a href="3183.htm">3183</a>. And since, when he dies, a person passes from 
things belonging to time into those of the life where time does not exist, and in so doing he assumes a new state, 'old age' means that which is new, here a new representative; for it is to this representation 
involving Abraham that 'old age', and also 'an old man and full [of years]' have reference, as may become clear from what has been stated just above. </p>

`In senectute bona, senex et satur': quod significet novum repraesentationis, constat a significatione `senectutis' in sensu interno quod sit exuere vetus et induere novum, de qua n. 1854, 2198, 3016: 
quod sit novum, seu status novus, qui per `senectutem' in sensu interno significatur, est quia apud angelos pro quibus sensus internus Verbi, nulla idea temporis est, ita nulla talium quae sunt temporis, 
ut aetatum hominis, nempe infantiae, pueritiae, adolescentiae, adultae aetatis, et senectutis, sed pro illis omnibus ideam habeat statuum, ut pro tempore infantiae habent ideam status innocentiae, 
pro tempore pueritiae et adolescentiae ideam status affectionis boni et veri, pro adulta aetate ideam status intelligentiae, ac pro `senectute' ideam status sapientiae, n. 3183; et quia tunc homo 
ab illis quae sunt temporis, transit in illa quae sunt vitae absque tempore, ac sic novum statum induit, per `senectutem' significatur novum, et hic novum repraesentativum, quia de hoc apud Abrahamum 
praedicatur senectus, {1}tum `senex et satur,' ut ab illis quae mox supra dicta sunt, constare potest. @1 et quod$  </p>
