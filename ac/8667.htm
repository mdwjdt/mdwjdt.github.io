Verses 8-11. And Moses told his father-in-law all that Jehovah had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the trouble that followed them in the way, and Jehovah rescued them. And 
Jethro rejoiced over all the good that Jehovah had done to Israel, who rescued them out of the hand of the Egyptians. And Jethro said, Blessed be Jehovah, who hath rescued you out of the hand of the 
Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; who rescued His people from under the hand of the Egyptians. Now I know that Jehovah is great above all the gods; for the reason that they dealt proudly over 
them. "And Moses told his father-in-law all that Jehovah had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians," signifies perception then from truth Divine concerning the power of the Lord's Divine Human against 
those who were in falsities and infested; "for Israel's sake," signifies in behalf of those who are of the spiritual church; "all the trouble that found them in the way," signifies labor in temptations; 
"and Jehovah rescued them," signifies liberation by virtue of the Lord's Divine aid; "and Jethro rejoiced over all the good that Jehovah had done to Israel," signifies a state of Divine good when 
all things succeed; "who rescued them out of the hand of the Egyptians," signifies on account of liberation from the reviling of those who infested; "and Jethro said, Blessed be Jehovah," signifies the 
Divine good;* "who hath rescued you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh," signifies liberation from the reviling of those who infested; "who hath rescued His people from 
under the hand of the Egyptians," signifies mercy toward those who were in the good of truth and truth of good; "now I know that Jehovah is great above all the gods," signifies the Lord, that there is 
no God besides Him; "for the reason that they dealt proudly over them," signifies by reason of the endeavor to rule over those who are of the church.  *  Compare n. 8674. [REVISER] </p>

Verses 8-11 And Moses told his father-in-law all that Jehovah had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the distress that had come upon them on the way, and how Jehovah had rescued

of the Egyptians and from the hand of Pharaoh, who has rescued His people from under the hand of the Egyptians. Now I know that Jehovah is greater than all gods, for this reason, that they behaved 
proudly over them. </p>

Vers. 8-11.  Et narravit Moscheh socero suo omne quod fecerat Jehovah Pharaoni et Aegyptiis propter causas Israelis; omnem molestiam quae invenit illos in via, et eripuit illos Jehovah.  Et (x)gavisus 
est Jethro super omni bono quod fecit Jehovah Israeli, Qui eripuit illos e manu Aegyptiorum.  Et dixit Jethro, Benedictus Jehovah, Qui eripuit vos e manu (x)Aegyptiorum et e manu Pharaonis, Qui eripuit 
populum Suum e sub manu Aegyptiorum.  Nunc novi quod magnus Jehovah prae omnibus diis, quia eapropter quod superbiverint super illos.  `Et narravit Moscheh socero suo omne quod fecerat Jehovah Pharaoni 
et Aegyptiis' significat perceptionem tunc a vero Divino de potentia Divini Humani Domini contra illos qui in falsis fuerunt et infestaverunt: `propter causas Israelis' significat pro illis qui

super omni bono quod fecit Jehovah Israeli' significat statum Divini Boni cum succedunt omnia: `Qui eripuit illos e manu Aegyptiorum' significat ob liberationem ab infestantium insultu: `et dixit Jethro, 
Benedictus Jehovah' significat {1}Divinum Bonum: `Qui eripuit vos e manu Aegyptiorum et e manu Pharaonis' significat liberationem ab insultu infestantium: `Qui eripuit populum Suum e sub manu Aegyptiorum' 
significat misericordiam erga illos qui in bono veri et vero boni: `nunc novi quod magnus Jehovah prae omnibus diis' significat Dominum, quod nullus Deus praeter Ipsum: `quia eapropter quod 
superbiverint super illos' significat ob conatum et vim dominandi super illos qui ab Ecclesia. 	@1 See n. 8674, note 1.$ </p>
