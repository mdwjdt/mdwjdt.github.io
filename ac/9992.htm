<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9992节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9992.</strong>“无酵饼”表人的至内在部分里面的属天之物的洁净。这从“饼”和“无酵”的含义清楚可知：“饼”是指属天之物（参看<a href="2165.htm">2165</a>，<a href="2177.htm">2177</a>，<a href="3478.htm">3478</a>，<a href="9545.htm">9545</a>节）；“无酵”是指已洁净之物，如下文所述。它之所以表示人的至内在部分，是因为属天之物在于爱之良善，爱之良善是至内在的。人里面有三个层级按次序相继出现；这三者被称为“属天层”、“属灵层”和“属世层”。属天层是对主之爱的良善；属灵层是对邻之仁的良善；由此降下来的属世层是信之良善，这属世层因从属灵层降下，故被称为“属灵-属世层”。人的情形类似天堂里的情形。至内层天堂，也叫第三层天堂，是属天层所在的地方；第二层或中间天堂，是属灵层所在的地方；第一层或最低层天堂是从属灵层降下来的属世层，或属灵-属世层所在的地方。人的情形之所以类似天堂里的情形，是因为一个处于良善的人就是一个最小形式的天堂（参看<a href="9279.htm">9279</a>节所提到的地方）。关于天堂或天国的这三层划分，等到论述细麦面所作的糕饼和薄饼时，再予以详述。<br />“无酵”表示已洁净之物，是因为“酵母”表示邪恶所产生的虚假（<a href="2342.htm">2342</a>，<a href="7906.htm">7906</a>节）；因此，“无酵”或“不用酵母作”表示洁净或没有这种虚假。“酵母”表示邪恶所产生的虚假，是因为这种虚假玷污了良善，也玷污了真理，还因为它引发争战或产生冲突；因为当这虚假接近良善时，就会引发灼热或出现骚动；当这虚假接近真理时，则会发生碰撞。这一切都解释了为何在燔祭和祭牲中会用到由无酵饼构成的素祭。因此经上规定，凡献给耶和华的素祭都不可有酵（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利2.11.htm">2:11</a>）；不可将我祭牲的血和有酵之物一同献上（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出23.18.htm">23:18</a>）；逾越节期间，凡有酵的，都不可吃，凡吃的，都要从以色列中剪除（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.15.htm">12:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.18.htm">18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.20.htm">20</a>）。逾越节期间，凡吃了有酵之物的，之所以都要从以色列中剪除，是因为逾越节表示摆脱诅咒，尤其摆脱邪恶所产生的虚假，这种摆脱在那些允许自己被主重生的人中间实现（参看<a href="7093.htm">7093</a>，<a href="9286.htm">9286</a>-<a href="9292.htm">9292</a>节）。这也解释了为何这个节日被称为无酵饼节。</p>

And bread of unleavened things. That this signifies the purification of the celestial in the inmost of man, is evident from the signification of "bread," as being what is celestial (see n. 2165, 2177, 
3478, 9545); and from the signification of "unleavened," as being what has been purified (of which below). That it denotes the inmost of man, is because the celestial is the good of love, and the good 
of love is inmost. There are three things with man which follow on in successive order. These three are called "the celestial," "the spiritual," and "the natural." The celestial is the good of love 
to the Lord; the spiritual is the good of charity toward the neighbor; and the natural thence derived is the good of faith, which, being from the spiritual, is called "the spiritual natural." For the 
case with man is similar to what it is in the heavens. In the inmost heaven, which is also called the third, is the celestial; in the second or middle heaven is the spiritual; and in the first or ultimate 
heaven is the natural thence derived, or the spiritual natural. That the case with man is similar to what it is in the heavens, is because a man who is in good is a heaven in the least form (see 
the places cited in n. 9279). Concerning the threefold division of heaven or of the heavenly kingdom, more will be told below when treating of the cakes and wafers of fine flour of wheat. [2] That "unleavened" 
signifies purified, is because "fermented" signifies falsity from evil (n. 2342, 7906); hence "unleavened" or "unfermented" signifies pure, or without this falsity. That "fermented" signifies 
falsity from evil, is because this falsity defiles good, and also truth, and also because it excites fighting; for on the approach of this falsity to good a burning heat is excited, and on its approach 
to truth, collision. For this reason a meat-offering of unleavened bread was employed in the burnt-offerings and in the sacrifices. Therefore it was ordered that "no meat-offering which they should 
bring to Jehovah should be made leavened" (Lev. 2:11); that they "should not sacrifice the blood of the sacrifice upon what was leavened" (Exod. 23:18); and that on the feast of the passover, they 
"should eat nothing leavened," and that he who did eat "should be cut off from Israel" (Exod. 12:15, 18-20). That he was to be cut off from Israel who ate what was leavened on the feast of the passover, 
was because the feast of the passover signified liberation from damnation, and specifically liberation from falsities from evil, with those who suffer themselves to be regenerated by the Lord (see 
n. 7093, 9286-9292); hence also this feast was called "the feast of unleavened things." </p>

'And unleavened bread' means purification of what is celestial in the inmost part of a person. This is clear from the meaning of 'bread' as that which is celestial, dealt with in <a href="2165.htm">2165</a>, <a href="2177.htm">2177</a>, <a href="3478.htm">3478</a>, <a href="9545.htm">9545</a>; 
and from the meaning of what is 'unleavened' as what has been purified, dealt with below. The inmost part of a person is meant because what is celestial consists in the good of love, and the good 
of love is inmost. There are three degrees in a person that follow one another in order; and these three are called celestial, spiritual, and natural. The celestial degree is the good of love to the 
Lord, the spiritual is the good of charity towards the neighbour, and the natural descending from this is the good of faith, which, since it descends from the spiritual, is called spiritual-natural. The 
situation with a person resembles that in the heavens. The inmost heaven, also called the third heaven, is where the celestial degree is situated; the second or middle heaven is where the spiritual 
degree does so; and the first or lowest heaven is where the natural descending from the spiritual, or the spiritual-natural degree, does so. The reason why the situation with a person resembles that 
in the heavens is that a person in whom good is present is heaven in the smallest form it takes, see the places referred to in <a href="9279.htm">9279</a>. The celestial heaven or kingdom and the division of this too into three 
will be spoken of in what follows next where cakes and wafers made from fine wheat flour are the subject.  </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 'Unleavened' means what has been purified because 'yeast' means falsity arising from 
evil, <a href="2342.htm">2342</a>, <a href="7906.htm">7906</a>, so that 'unleavened' or made without yeast means pure or free from that falsity. 'Yeast' means falsity arising from evil because such falsity defiles good, and truth as well, and 
also because it gives rise to conflict; for when that falsity gets near good, agitation occurs, and when it gets near truth, a collision takes place. All this explains why a minchah consisting of unleavened 
bread was included in burnt offerings and sacrifices. Therefore it was decreed that every minchah which they brought to Jehovah should be made without yeast, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%202:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 2:11</a>; that they should not sacrifice 
the blood of a sacrifice with anything made with yeast, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2023:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 23:18</a>; and that during the feast of Passover they should not eat anything made with yeast, and that anyone eating it should be cut 
off from Israel, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2012:15,%2018-20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 12:15, 18-20</a>. The reason why anyone who ate anything made with yeast during the feast of Passover should be cut off from Israel was that the feast of Passover was a sign of deliverance 
from damnation, and in particular of deliverance from falsities arising from evil, accomplished with those who allow themselves to be regenerated by the Lord, see <a href="7093.htm">7093</a>, <a href="9286.htm">9286</a>-<a href="9292.htm">9292</a>. This also explains 
why it was called the feast of unleavened bread.  </p>

`Et panem azymorum': quod significet purificationem caelestis in intimo hominis {1}, constat ex significatione `panis' quod sit caeleste, de qua n. 2165, 2177, 3478, 9545, et ex significatione `azymi' 
quod sit purificatum, de qua sequitur; quod sit intimum hominis, est quia caeleste est bonum amoris, et bonum amoris est intimum; sunt tria apud hominem quae consequuntur in ordine successivo; illa 
tria vocantur caeleste, spirituale, et naturale; caeleste est bonum amoris in Dominum, spirituale est bonum charitatis' erga proximum, et naturale inde est bonum fidei, quod quia est ex spirituali, {2} 
vocatur spirituale naturale; nam similiter se habet apud hominem, prout in caelis: in intimo caelo, quod etiam tertium caelum vocatur, est caeleste, in secundo seu medio caelo est spirituale, et in 
primo seu ultimo caelo est naturale inde seu spirituale naturale; quod similiter se habeat apud hominem prout in caelis, est causa quia homo qui in bono, est caelum in minima forma, videantur {3} citata 
n. 9279.  De tripartitione etiam caeli seu regni caelestis, in {4} sequentibus dicetur ubi de placentis, et laganis ex simila triticorum. 	[2] Quod `azymum' significet purificatum, est quia `fermentum' 
significat falsum ex malo, n. 2342, 7906; inde `azymum' seu infermentatum significat purum seu absque falso illo; quod `fermentum' (x)significet falsum ex malo, est quia id falsum conspurcat bonum, 
et quoque verum, tum quia excitat pugnam, nam accedente illo falso ad bonum fit fervor, et ad verum fit collisio; inde est quod minhah ex pane azymo in holocaustis et in sacrificiis adhibita fuerit; 
ideo {5} statutum est quod omnis minhah quam adferrent Jehovae non conficeretur fermentata, Lev. ii 11; quod non sacrificarent super fermentato sanguinem sacrificii, Exod. xxiii 18; quodque in festo 
paschatis prorsus non comederent fermentatum, et quod qui comederet exscinderetur ex Israele, Exod. xii 15, 18-20; quod exscinderetur ex Israele qui (o)in festo paschatis fermentatum ederet, fuit causa 
quia festum paschatis significabat liberationem a damnatione, (c)ac in specie liberationem a falsis ex malo, apud illos qui patiuntur se a Domino regenerari, videatur n. 7093, 9286-9292; inde quoque 
festum illud vocabatur festum azymorum. @1 homine IT$ @2 etiam$ @3 i loca$ @4 i nunc$ @5 inde$ </p>
