<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4804节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4804.</strong>在来世有很多社群被称为友谊社群。他们由那些活在肉身时偏爱与他人交往的快乐胜过任何其它快乐，并且喜欢与他们交往的人，却不在意他们是好还是坏，只要能给他们带来快乐就行的人组成。因此，他们不是良善或真理的朋友。活在肉身时是这样的人在来世还是这样；他们彼此依恋，仅仅是由于他们与其他人交往的快乐。许多这样的社群曾与我同在，但都保持一定距离；这些社群大部分出现在头顶上，稍微偏右一点。我通过一种迟钝和懒洋洋的感觉，以及我自己的快乐丧失而发觉他们在场；因为像这样的社群若在场，就会造成这些效果。事实上，他们无论到哪里，都会夺走别人的快乐；说来奇妙，他们却将这快乐变成自己的；因为他们会转离与其他人同在的灵人，并把他们转向自己，由此把别人的快乐转到自己这里。由于这个原因，他们对那些处于良善的人来说是危险和有害的，所以主拖住他们，防止他们接近天上的社群。我由此得以知道，如果关注的是人而不是良善，友谊对人的属灵生命会造成多么大的伤害。诚然，谁都能与别人交朋友，但最重要的是，他要与良善交朋友。</p>

There are very many societies in the other life that are called societies of friendship. They are composed of those who in the life of the body preferred to every other delight that of conversation, 
and who loved those with whom they conversed, not caring whether they were good or evil, provided they were entertaining; and thus who were not friends to good or to truth. They who have been such in 
the life of the body are such also in the other life, in which they associate solely from the delight of conversation. Many such societies have been with me, but at a distance, being seen chiefly a little 
to the right above the head. That they were present it was given me to note by a torpor and dullness, and by a privation of the delight in which I was, the presence of such societies inducing these 
effects. For wherever they come they take delight away from others, and wonderful to say, they make it their own; for they turn away the spirits who are with others, and turn them to themselves, whereby 
they transfer another's delight to themselves; and as they are on this account troublesome and injurious to those who are in good, they are therefore kept away by the Lord, lest they should come 
near to the heavenly societies. From this it was given me to know how much injury friendship occasions man as to his spiritual life if the person and not good is regarded; everyone may indeed be friendly 
to another, but still he should be most friendly to what is good. </p>

There are very many communities in the next life which are called friendship-communities. They consist of those who during their lifetime preferred the delight of association with others to any other 
delight and who loved those with whom they associated, without any interest at all in whether these were good or evil people, provided they gave them delight. Thus they were not ones who befriended what 
was good and true. Those who have been like this during their lifetime remain the same in the next life; they attach themselves to one another solely because of their delight of association with others. 
Many such communities have been present with me, though kept at a distance, visible for the most part overhead, slightly to the right. I was made aware of their presence by a dull and sluggish 
feeling, and by a loss of my own feeling of delight; for the presence of communities such as these leads to this. Indeed when they arrive on the scene they remove others' feeling of delight, and what 
is remarkable they make it their own. For they turn away the spirits present with others and direct them towards themselves, thereby transferring another's delight to themselves. And because such communities 
are for this reason dangerous and harmful to those governed by good, the Lord therefore holds them back to prevent them going near heavenly communities. From this I was enabled to know how much 
harm friendship does to someone's spiritual life if he pays attention to the person but not to what is good. Anyone can indeed befriend another; but most of all he ought to befriend what is good. </p>

Sunt perplures societates in altera vita quae amicitiae societates vocantur; constituuntur ab illis qui in vita corporis jucundum conversationis praetulerunt omni alii jucundo, et qui amaverunt illos 
cum quibus conversati sunt, nihil curantes num boni aut mali fuerint, modo delectabiles, ita non qui fuerunt bono nec vero.  Qui tales fuerunt in vita corporis, tales etiam sunt in altera vita, 
adjungunt se ex sola delectatione conversationis; </p>
<p>plures tales societates apud me fuerunt, sed ad distantiam, visae imprimis paulum ad dextrum supra caput; quod adessent, animadvertere datum per 
torporem et hebetudinem, et per privationem jucundi in quo essem, praesentia enim talium societatum illa inducit; ubi enim veniunt, auferunt jucundum aliis, et quod mirum, illud sibi appropriant, avertunt 
enim spiritus qui apud alios, et ad se convertunt, inde jucundum alterius transferunt ad se, et quia inde molestae et damnosae sunt illis qui in bono, ideo a Domino arcentur ne ad caelestes 
societates prope veniant; inde scire datum quantum damni quoad spiritualem vitam infert homini amicitia si spectatur persona non bonum; quisque quidem amicus potest esse alteri, sed usque amicissimus 
erit bono. </p>
