<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3095节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3095.</strong>“她就急忙清空水瓶，倒在水槽里”表正被引入神圣良善的真理之情感的分离。这从“清空水瓶”和“水槽”或引水渠的含义清楚可知。“清空水瓶”是指把真理分离出来；“水瓶”因是盛载的器皿，故不仅表示有真理在里面的记忆知识，还表示有良善在里面的真理（参看<a href="3068.htm">3068</a>，<a href="3079.htm">3079</a>节）。此处由于论述的是引入，故它表示正被引入神圣良善的真理。真理本身若不通过它自己的情感（参看<a href="3024.htm">3024</a>开头，<a href="3066.htm">3066</a>节），就绝无可能与良善联结（因情感里面有能使它们联结起来的生命），故此处所指的是对真理的情感。“水槽”或引水渠是指真理的良善，因为水槽里的“水”表真理（参看<a href="739.htm">739</a>，<a href="2702.htm">2702</a>节），而水槽本身和木头所表相同，即表良善（参看<a href="2784.htm">2784</a>，<a href="2812.htm">2812</a>节）。真理的良善藉由真理从良善产生，就像是由为母亲的真理和为父亲的良善所生出的后代。属世人里面的一切真正良善皆由此而来，也就是来自理性人中良善与真理的婚姻。这良善就被称作真理的良善，在圣言中，由“水槽”或引水渠来表示。</p>

And she hasted and emptied her pitcher into the trough. That this signifies the separation of the affection of the truth which was being initiated into Divine good, is evident from the signification 
of "emptying the pitcher," as being to separate the truth; for by a "pitcher," as a containing vessel, is signified not merely the memory-knowledge in which is truth, but also the truth in which is good 
(see n. 3068, 3079); and here, because initiation is treated of, it signifies the truth which was being initiated into Divine good. And because truth itself cannot possibly be conjoined with good except 
through its affection (see n. 3024 at the beginning, 3066), for in affection is the life through which is conjunction, therefore here it is the affection of truth that is meant. The meaning of the 
passage is also evident from the signification of a "trough," or "watering place," as being the good of truth; for the water in the trough signifies truth (see n. 739, 2702), and the trough itself 
signifies the same as wood, namely, good (see n. 2784, 2812). The good of truth is that which is produced from good by means of truth, and is like an offspring born of truth as a mother, and of good as 
a father. All the genuine good in the natural man is from this, that is, from the marriage of good and truth in the rational. This good is that which is called the good of truth, and is signified in 
the Word by a "trough," or "watering place." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3095</b></p><p><b>3095.</b>
'And she hastened and emptied her pitcher into the trough' means the separation of the affection for truth which was being introduced into Divine good. This is clear from the meaning of 'emptying the 
pitcher' as separating truth (for 'a pitcher', being a containing vessel, means not only factual knowledge that has truth in it but also truth that has good in it, see <a href="3068.htm">3068</a>, <a href="3079.htm">3079</a>. In this instance truth 
that was being introduced into Divine good is meant, since introduction is the subject. And because truth itself is never joined to good except by means of its own affection, <a href="3024.htm">3024</a>, <a href="3066.htm">3066</a> - for within 
the affection there is the life which enables them to be joined together - it is the affection for truth that is meant here); and also from the meaning of 'a trough' or channel to accommodate water, 
as truth which rests in good, for 'the water' in the trough means truth, <a href="739.htm">739</a>, <a href="2702.htm">2702</a>, while the trough itself is similar in meaning to wood, namely good, <a href="2784.htm">2784</a>, <a href="2812.htm">2812</a>. Truth which rests in good is that 
which is produced from good by means of truth, and is like offspring born from truth as mother and from good as father. All genuine good in the natural man originates in this way, that is, from the marriage 
of good and truth in the rational. This good is that which is called truth that rests in good and is meant in the Word by 'a bough' or channel to accommodate water. </p>

`Et festinabat et evacuabat cadum suum ad canalem': quod significet separationem affectionis veri quae initiabatur bono Divino, constat ex significatione `evacuare cadum' quod sit separare verum; per 
`cadum' enim ut per vas continens non modo significatur scientificum in quo verum, sed etiam verum in quo bonum, videatur n. 3068, 3079; hic quia de initiatione agitur, est verum quod initiabatur bono 
Divino; et quia ipsum verum nusquam conjungitur bono nisi per affectionem suam, n. 3024 pr, 3066, nam in affectione est vita per quam conjunctio, ideo hic est affectio veri quae intelligitur: tum ex 
significatione `canalis' seu aqualiculi quod sit veri bonum, `aqua' enim in canali significat verum, n. 739, 2702, ac ipse canalis simile ac lignum, nempe bonum, n. 2784, 2812; veri bonum est quod producitur 
a bono per verum, et est sicut proles nata ex vero ut a matre, et a bono ut a patre, omne bonum genuinum quod in naturali homine, est inde seu ex conjugio boni et veri in rationali; hoc bonum 
est quod vocatur veri bonum et significatur in Verbo per `canalem' seu aqualiculum. </p>
