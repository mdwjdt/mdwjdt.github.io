<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2422节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2422.</strong>“罗得对他们说，我主啊，不要如此”表软弱，因为他做不到。这从这些话本身所包含的情感，以及下文清楚可知。此处论述的主题是本章“罗得”所代表的教会的第三个状态，在这种状态下，人们不再出于对良善的情感思考和行事，而是出于对真理的情感。当对良善的情感开始减弱，可以说消退时，这种状态就占了上风。诚然，良善存在，但却越发向内层退去，从而居于模糊中；然而，它仍表现为某种情感，这种情感被称作对真理的情感。至于何为对良善的情感，何为对真理的情感，可参看上下文（<a href="1997.htm">1997</a>，<a href="2425.htm">2425</a>节）。对人来说，这些状态的存在并不明显，更不用说它们的性质了。但对天使来说，这些状态如同在光天化日下那样显而易见，因为天使就在于人的一切良善情感中。当这人进入来世后，在他自己看来，它们也是显而易见的。善人根据这些情感及其性质而分为不同的社群（<a href="685.htm">685</a>节）。</p>

Lot said unto them, Nay I pray my lords. That this signifies weakness, so that he could not, is evident from the affection in the very words, as also from what follows. There is here treated of the third 
state of the church represented in this chapter by Lot, which is that they no longer think and act from the affection of good, but from the affection of truth; which state succeeds, when the affection 
of good begins to be diminished, and as it were to recede. Good is indeed present, but has withdrawn itself more toward the interiors, and therefore is in obscurity; and yet it manifests itself 
in a certain affection, which is called the affection of truth. (What the affection of good is, and what the affection of truth, may be seen above, n. 1997, and in what presently follows, n. 2425.) That 
there are these states is not apparent to man, still less what is the nature of them; but they are apparent to the angels as in clear light, for the angels are in every good affection of man; and they 
are apparent also to man himself when he comes into the other life. It is in accordance with these affections, and the quality of them, that the good are distinguished into societies (n. 685). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2422</b></p><p><b>2422.</b>
That 'Lot said to them, Not so, my Lords' means weakness in that he could not do so is clear from the affectional content of the words themselves, and also from what follows. The subject at this point 
is the third state of the Church which is represented in this chapter by 'Lot', a state in which men no longer think and act from the affection for good but from the affection for truth. This state 
takes over when the affection for good starts to decrease and so to speak to depart. Good is indeed present but it has withdrawn itself more towards the interior parts and therefore dwells in obscurity; 
yet it reveals itself in a type of affection, which is referred to as the affection for truth. What the affection for good is, and what the affection for truth, see <a href="1997.htm">1997</a>, and also <a href="2425.htm">2425</a> just below. 
Not even the existence, still less the nature of these states is apparent to man; but those states are apparent to angels as in broad daylight; for the angels are in every good affection of a man. They 
are also apparent to the man himself when he enters the next life. It is in accordance with those affections and with their nature that the good are divided into separate communities, <a href="685.htm">685</a>. </p>

</p><b>2422.</b>
Quod `dixit Lot ad eos, Ne quaeso Domini mei' significet imbecillitatem quod non posset, constat ex affectione in ipsis verbi' tum a sequentibus.  Hic nunc agitur de tertio statu Ecclesiae, quae per 
`Lotum' in hoc capite repraesentatur, qui est quod non amplius cogitent et agant ex affectione boni sed ex affectione veri; qui status succedit quando affectio boni incipit diminui, et quasi recedere; 
bonum quidem adest, sed retraxit se magis versus interiora, inde in obscuro est, at se manifestat in quadam affectione quae dicitur affectio veri; quid affectio boni et quid affectio veri, videatur 
n. 1997, et (t)in mox seq. n. 2425. Status hi quod sint, non apparent homini, minus quales sunt, sed apparent angelis ut in clara luce, nam angeli sunt in omni bona affectione hominis; apparent etiam 
ipsi homini, dum in alteram vitam venit; secundum affectiones illas, et secundum quale earum, distincti sunt boni in societates, n. 685. </p>
