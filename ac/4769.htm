<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4769节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4769.</strong>“从母山羊当中宰了一只公山羊”表从快乐所得来的外在真理。这从“母山羊当中的公山羊”的含义清楚可知，“母山羊当中的公山羊”是指属世真理，也就是属于带来生命快乐的外在人的真理，以及从快乐所得来的外在真理，如下文所述。属于带来生命快乐的外在人的真理就是诸如存在于圣言字义中的那类神性真理，这些真理形成纯正教会的教义基础。严格来说，这些真理由“公山羊”来表示，源于它们的快乐由“母山羊”来表示。因此，“母山羊当中的公山羊”在真正意义上表示那些处于这类真理和由此而来的快乐之人。然而，就反面意义而言，“母山羊当中的公山羊”表示那些知道外在真理，也就是源于字义的真理表象的人，这些外在真理，或真理的表象与他们的生命快乐，就是诸如通常被称作快感的身体快乐，以及通常被称作荣誉和利益的低层心智的快乐相一致。“母山羊当中的公山羊”在反面意义上就表示这种人。简言之，“母山羊当中的公山羊”在反面意义上表示持守与仁分离之信的信徒，因为这些人只从圣言选取那些与他们的生命快乐相一致，也就是支持自我之爱和尘世之爱的真理。他们利用解释将其它真理带入确认，由此使虚假显为真理的表象。<br />“母山羊当中的公山羊”表示持守与仁分离之信的信徒，这一点可见于但以理书：<br />看哪，母山羊当中的一只公山羊从西而来，遍行全地面，又不触着地；这公山羊两眼之间有一非常的角。四角之中，有一角长出一个小角，向南、向东、向荣美之地，渐渐成为强大。它渐渐强大，高及天象，将些天象和星宿抛落在地，并践踏它们；它将真理抛在地上。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.5.htm">8:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.9.htm">9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.10.htm">10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.12.htm">12</a>）<br />此处论述的主题是总体上的教会状态，不仅包括犹太教会的状态，还包括随后的教会，也就是基督教会的状态；因为主的圣言是普世的，包罗万象。当论及犹太教会时，“母山羊当中的公山羊”表示那些视内在真理为一文不值，而是接受外在真理，只要这些真理迎合他们的爱，也就是他们想要成为最伟大和最富有之人的欲望。因此，他们将他们所期待的基督或弥赛亚仅视为一个王，祂会把他们高举在全世界所有民族和人民之上，使这些人臣服于他们，如同最卑贱的奴隶。这就是他们对祂的爱之源头。他们根本就为知道何为对邻之爱，只知道对邻之爱是因着共享上述崇高地位并通过物质利益缔结的联盟。<br />但当论及基督教会时，“母山羊当中的公山羊”则表示那些拥有从快乐所得来的外在真理的人，也就是持守与仁分离之信的信徒；因为这些人对内在真理也没有任何兴趣，即便教导真理，也只是为了能由此赢得名声，被提到崇高地位，获得物质利益。当他们用口唇说出真理时，这些就是他们所心系的快乐。更有甚者，他们利用错误的解释迫使纯正信仰的真理坚持他们的爱。由此可见，但以理书中的上述这些话在内义上表示什么，即：“母山羊当中的一只公山羊”表示持守与仁分离之信的信徒。“公山羊从西而来”表示出自邪恶，因为“西”表示邪恶（参看<a href="3708.htm">3708</a>节）。它“遍行全地面，又不触着地”表示他进入整个教会；因为在圣言中，“地”无非表示教会所在之地，因而表示教会（<a href="566.htm">566</a>，<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1068.htm">1068</a>，<a href="1262.htm">1262</a>，<a href="1413.htm">1413</a>，<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>，<a href="2928.htm">2928</a>，<a href="3355.htm">3355</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="4453.htm">4453</a>节）。它所拥有的“角”表示源于虚假的能力（<a href="2832.htm">2832</a>节）。“两眼之间有一非常的角”表示源于推理信之真理的能力，这从前面关于眼睛的说明可以看出来（<a href="4403.htm">4403</a>-<a href="4421.htm">4421</a>，<a href="4523.htm">4523</a>-<a href="4534.htm">4534</a>节）。“有一角向南、向东、向荣美之地，渐渐成为强大”表示源于与仁分离之信的能力逐渐扩张，甚至进入天堂之光所照亮的状态，就是良善与真理的状态。因为“南”表示光明的状态（参看<a href="3708.htm">3708</a>节），“东”表示良善的状态（<a href="1250.htm">1250</a>，<a href="3249.htm">3249</a>，<a href="3708.htm">3708</a>节）；“荣美之地”表示真理的状态，这从圣言各处明显看出来。“它渐渐强大，高及天象，将些天象和星宿抛落在地，并践踏它们”表示这种事发生在对良善与真理的认知上，因为“天象和星宿”表示对良善与真理的认知（参看<a href="4697.htm">4697</a>节）。由此可知“将真理抛在地上”表示什么，即表示抛落真正的信仰，真正的信仰本身就是仁爱；事实上，信仰关注仁爱，因为它从仁爱发出。在古教会被称作真理的，在新教会被称作信仰（<a href="4690.htm">4690</a>节）。<br />以西结书中的“公山羊”具有类似含义：<br />看哪，我必在羊与羊中间，公绵羊与公山羊中间施行判断。你们吃光了美好的草场，剩下的草场，你们竟用蹄践踏了，还以为小事吗？你们喝清水，剩下的水，你们竟用蹄搅浑了。你们用角骶触，直到把一切虚弱的（绵羊）驱散到外面。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结34.17.htm">34:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结34.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结34.21.htm">21</a>）<br />在这段经文中，“公山羊”也表示持守与仁分离之信的信徒，也就是那些将教义置于生活之上，最终根本不关注生活的人。然而，构成人的，是生活，而非脱离生活的教义；死后存留的，是生活，而不是教义，除非它教导生活的事。论到这些人，经上说他们“吃光了美好的草场，剩下的草场，竟用蹄践踏了”；他们“喝清水，剩下的水，竟用蹄搅浑了”；还有，他们“用角骶触，直到把一切虚弱的（绵羊）驱散到外面”。<br />由此可见“公山羊”指的是哪种人，主在马太福音中所说的“绵羊”指的是哪种人：<br />万族要聚集在祂面前，祂要把他们彼此分别出来，好像牧羊的分别绵羊公山羊一般；把绵羊安置在右边，山羊在左边。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.32.htm">25:32</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.33.htm">33</a>）<br />“绵羊”表示那些拥有仁爱，因而拥有信之真理的人；“公山羊”表示那些尽管拥有信之真理，却没有任何仁爱的人，也就是那些坚持与仁分离之信的人，这一点从这段经文中描述这种人的每个细节明显看出来。<br />至于“公山羊”所指的持守与仁分离之信的信徒指的是谁，具有何种品质，这从下面两段经文可以看出来：<br />凡不结好果子的树，就砍下来丢在火里。所以，凭着他们的果子，就可以认出他们来。凡称呼我主啊，主啊的人，不能都进天国；惟独遵行我天父旨意的人，才能进去。当那日，必有许多人对我说，主啊，主啊，我们不是奉你的名说过预言，奉你的名赶鬼，奉你的名行许多异能吗？我就明明地告诉他们说，我从来不认识你们，你们这些作恶的人，离开我去吧！（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.19.htm">7:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.23.htm">23</a>）<br />路加福音：<br />你们开始站在外面叩门，说，主啊，主啊，给我们开门！祂必回答你们说，我不晓得你们是哪里来的！那时，你们开始说，我们在你面前吃过、喝过，你也在我们的街上教训过人。他要说，我告诉你们，我不晓得你们是哪里来的。你们这一切作恶的人，离开我去吧！（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.25.htm">13:25</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.27.htm">27</a>）<br />这些就是坚持与仁分离之信、被称为“公山羊”的人。至于“公山羊”在正面意义上表示什么，如祭祀当中所用到的公山羊，和先知书各处所提及的公山羊，蒙主的神性怜悯，我将在别处予以告知。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4769</b></p><p><b>4769.</b>
And killed a he-goat of the goats. That this signifies external truths from delights, is evident from the signification in the Word of a "he-goat of the goats" as being natural truths, that is, truths 
of the external man from which are the delights of life; and as also being external truths derived from delights, of which hereafter. The truths of the external man, from which are the delights of life, 
are Divine truths such as those of the literal sense of the Word, from which truths the doctrinals of a genuine church are derived; these truths are properly signified by a "he-goat" and the delights 
from them are signified by "goats;" thus by a "he-goat of the goats" in the genuine sense, are signified those who are in such truths and in delights therefrom. In the opposite sense however, by 
a "he-goat of the goats" are signified those who are in external truths (that is, in appearances of truth derived from the sense of the letter) which are in agreement with the delights of their life, 
such as the delights of the body, which in general are called pleasures, and the delights of the lower mind, which in general are honors and gains. Such persons are signified by a "he-goat of the goats" 
in the opposite sense. In a word, by a "he-goat of the goats" in this sense are signified those who are in faith separate from charity, for these select from the Word those truths only which are in 
agreement with the delights of their life, that is, which favor the loves of self and the world. The other truths they bring into conformity by interpretations, and thereby present falsities as appearances 
of truth. [2] That a "he-goat of the goats" signifies those who are in faith separate, is evident from Daniel: </p>
<p>     Behold a he-goat of the goats came from the west over the faces of the whole 
earth, and touched not the earth; and the he-goat had a horn of aspect between his eyes. Out of one of the four horns came forth a little horn, and it grew exceedingly toward the south, and toward the 
east, and toward comeliness. Yea it grew even to the army of the heavens; and some of the army and of the stars it cast down to the earth, and trampled upon them; and it cast down truth unto the earth 
(Dan. 8:5, 9-10, 12); </p>
<p>the subject here treated of is the state of the church in general, not only the state of the Jewish Church, but also that of the following, which is the Christian Church; for 
the Word of the Lord is universal. The "he-goat of the goats" in respect to the Jewish Church, signifies those who made nothing of internal truths, but accepted external truths so far as they favored 
their loves, which were that they might be the greatest and the wealthiest. For this reason they recognized the Christ or Messiah whom they were expecting, simply as a king, who would exalt them above 
all the nations and peoples in the whole world, and would make these subject to them as vilest slaves; this was the source of their love for Him. They did not at all know what love toward the neighbor 
was, except that it was conjunction by participation in such honor, and through gain. [3] But the "he-goat of the goats" in respect to the Christian Church signifies those who are in external truths 
from delights, that is, who are in faith separate; for these also care nothing for internal truths, and if they teach them it is only that they may thereby win reputation, be exalted to honors, and 
acquire gain. These are the delights which are in their hearts while truths are in their mouth. Moreover, by wrong interpretations they force the truths which are of genuine faith to favor their loves. 
Hence it is evident what is signified in the internal sense by the above words in Daniel-namely, that by a "he-goat of the goats" are signified those who are in faith separate. The he-goat's coming 
from the west denotes from evil (that the "west" denotes evil may be seen above, n. 3708). His coming over the face of the whole earth, not touching the earth, denotes that he came over the whole church; 
for by the "earth" in the Word nothing else is meant than the land where the church is, thus the church (n. 566, 662, 1068, 1262, 1413, 1607, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 2928, 3355, 4447, 4453). The 
"horns" which he had are powers from falsity (n. 2832). The "horn of aspect between the eyes" is power from reasoning about the truths of faith, as may be seen from what was shown concerning the eye 
(n. 4403-4421, 4523-4534). The "one horn which grew toward the south, the east, and comeliness" is power from faith separate growing even toward those things which are states of the light of heaven, and 
states of good and truth. That the "south" is a state of light may be seen above (n. 3708), and that the "east" is a state of good (n. 1250, 3249, 3708); that "comeliness" is a state of truth is evident 
from the Word here and there. Its "growing even to the army of the heavens, and casting down to the earth some of the army and of the stars, and trampling upon them" denotes that it did so with 
the knowledges of good and truth. (That the "army of the heavens" and the "stars" are the knowledges of good and truth may be seen above, n. 4697.) From this is known what is meant by "casting down truth 
unto the earth" namely, the casting down of real faith, which in itself is charity; for faith has regard to charity, because it proceeds from charity. That which in the Ancient Church was called truth, 
in the new church is called faith (n.           4690). [4] The "he-goat" has a similar signification in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Behold I judge between small cattle and small cattle, between the rams and 
the he-goats. Is it a small thing to you that ye eat up the good pasture, and trample with your feet the residue of your pastures? Ye drink the settling of the waters, the remains ye disturb with your 
feet; ye strike with your horns all the infirm till ye have scattered them abroad (Ezek. 34:17-18, 21); </p>
<p>in this passage also by "he-goats" are signified those who are in faith separate, that is, who 
set doctrine before life, and at last have no care about life; when yet life, and not doctrine separate, makes the man; and the life remains after death, but not doctrine except insofar as it partakes 
of the life. Of these it is said that they "eat up the good pasture, and trample with their feet the residue of the pastures;" and that they "drink the settling of the waters, and disturb the remains 
with their feet;" also that they "strike the infirm with their horns till they have scattered them." [5] From all this it is now evident who are meant by the "he-goats" and who by the "sheep" of whom 
the Lord speaks in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Before Him shall be gathered all nations, and He shall separate them one from another as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the he-goats; and He shall set the 
sheep on his right hand, but the he-goats on the left, etc. (Matt. 25:32-33); </p>
<p>that the "sheep" are they who are in charity and thence in the truths of faith, and that the "he-goats" are they who are 
in no charity, although in the truths of faith, that is, who are in faith separate, is clear from the particulars, in which such persons are described. [6] Who and of what quality are those who are 
in faith separate and are meant by "he-goats" may be seen from the two following passages: </p>
<p>     "Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit shall be hewn down, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by 
their fruits ye shall know them. Not everyone that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens; but he that doeth the will of My Father who is in the heavens. Many will say 
to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied by Thy name, and by Thy name cast out demons, and in Thy name done many mighty works? And then will I confess unto them, I know you not; depart from 
Me ye workers of iniquity" (Matt. 7:19-23). And in Luke: </p>
<p>     "Then will ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us; but He shall answer and say to you, 
I know you not whence ye are. Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk before Thee, and Thou hast taught in our streets. But He shall say, I tell you I know you not whence ye are; depart from 
Me all ye workers of iniquity" (Luke 13:25-27). These are they who are in faith separate, and are called "he-goats." But what "he-goats" signify in a good sense-as those used in sacrifices and occasionally 
mentioned in the prophets-will of the Lord's Divine mercy be told elsewhere. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4769</b></p><p><b>4769.</b>
'And killed a he-goat of the she-goats' means external truths received from delights This is clear from the meaning of 'e he-goat of the she-goats' in the Word as natural truths, that is, truths belonging 
to the external man which give rise to the delights of life, and also as external truths received from delights, dealt with below. Truths belonging to the external man which give rise to the delights 
of life are Divine truths such as are present in the literal sense of the Word, which form the basis of the teachings of the genuine Church. These truths are meant strictly speaking by 'the he-goat', 
and the delights which spring from them are meant by 'the she-goats'. This being so, 'a he-goat of the she-goats' in the genuine sense means those who know truths of this kind and enjoy the delights 
that spring from them. But in the contrary sense 'a he-goat of the she-goats' means those who know external truths, that is, appearances of truth drawn from the sense of the letter which go along 
with their delights of life, such as things delighting the body, which are generally called pleasures, and those delighting the mind, which are generally called honours and gains. People of this kind 
are meant in the contrary sense by 'a he-goat of the she-goats'. In short, 'a he-goat of the she-goats' in this contrary sense means adherents to faith separated from charity, for these people take no 
other truths from the Word than those which are in agreement with their delights of life, that is, which accord with self-love and love of the world. And they reduce other truths to the same level by 
the use of interpretations, and in this way they present falsities as appearances of truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This meaning of 'a he-goat of the she-goats' as adherents to faith separated from charity may be seen 
in Daniel, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, a he-goat of the she-goats came from the west across the face of the whole earth, without touching the ground;<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and this goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes. Out of one 
of the four horns there came forth one little hoary, and it grew exceedingly towards the south, and towards the east, and towards the glorious [land]. Indeed, it grew even towards the host of heaven, 
and cast down to the earth some of the host, and of the stars, and trampled on them; and it cast down truth to the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%208:5,%209,%2010,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 8:5, 9, 10, 12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the state of the Church in general, 
not merely to the state of the Jewish Church but also to the state of the Church that followed it, the Christian one; for the Word of the Lord is all-embracing. When used in reference to the Jewish Church 
'a he-goat of the she-goats' means those who considered internal truths to be worthless; but they did accept external truths, insofar as these were in accord with their loves, which were their desire 
to be the greatest and to be the wealthiest people. Consequently they did not think of their expected Christ or Messiah as anyone other than a king who would exalt them above all nations and peoples 
throughout the world and would make these subject to them as the meanest slaves. This was the level to which they reduced their love of Him. As for what love towards the neighbour was, they had no 
knowledge at all, except as being associated with others with whom they shared the exalted position referred to above and as enjoying material gain. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But when used in reference to the Christian 
Church 'a he-goat of the she-goats' means those who possess external truths received from delights, that is, who adhere to faith separated from charity, for these people too have no interest at all in 
internal truths. If they do teach these it is solely so that they may thereby earn acclaim, be raised to exalted positions, and acquire material gains. These are the delights their hearts are set on 
when they utter truths with their lips. What is more, by wrong interpretations of the truths of genuine faith they make these accord with their own loves. From this one may see what the words in Daniel 
that are quoted above mean in the internal] sense. The phrase 'a he-goat of the she-goats' means adherents to faith separated from charity. The he-goat 'came from the west' means coming from evil, 
for 'the west' means evil, see <a href="3708.htm">3708</a>. It came 'across the face of the whole earth, without touching the ground' means coming into the whole Church, for 'earth' or 'land' in the Word means nothing else 
than the earth where the Church exists, and so means the Church, <a href="566.htm">566</a>, <a href="662.htm">662</a>, <a href="1067.htm">1067</a>, <a href="1262.htm">1262</a>, <a href="1413.htm">1413</a>, <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>, <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="1850.htm">1850</a>, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>, <a href="2118.htm">2118</a> (end), <a href="2928.htm">2928</a>, <a href="3355.htm">3355</a>, <a href="4435.htm">4435</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>. 'The horns' it had means powers derived from falsity, <a href="2832.htm">2832</a>, 'a conspicuous horn between the eyes' meaning power derived from reasoning about the truths of faith, as becomes clear from what has been shown regarding the eye in <a href="4403.htm">4403</a>- <a href="4421.htm">4421</a>, <a href="4523.htm">4523</a>-<a href="4534.htm">4534</a>. 
'The one horn which grew towards the south, the east, and the glorious [land]' means the expansion of power derived from faith separated from charity even into states lit by the light of heaven - states 
of goodness and truth; for 'the south' means a state of light, see <a href="3708.htm">3708</a>, 'the east' a state of goodness, <a href="1250.htm">1250</a>, <a href="3249.htm">3249</a>, <a href="3708.htm">3708</a>, 'the glorious [land]' a state of truth, as is clear from various places in 
the Word. 'It grew even towards the host of heaven, and cast down to the earth some of the host, and of the stars, and trampled on them' means that such a thing happened to cognitions of good and truth, 
for 'the hosts of heaven, and the stars' means cognitions of good and truth, <a href="4697.htm">4697</a>. From this one may see what is meant by 'it cast down truth to the earth', namely that faith itself was cast down, 
which in essence is charity; for faith looks to charity because it stems from it. That which in the Ancient Church was called truth is in the new one called faith, <a href="4690.htm">4690</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 'He-goat' is used with 
a similar meaning in Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, I am judging between one member of the flock and another, between rams and he-goats. Is it a small thing to you? You feed off the good pasture and tread down 
with your feet the rest of your pastures; you drink the water that has settled down<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> and stir up the rest with your feet. You butt with your horns all the weak [sheep] till you have scatted them abroad. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2034:17,%2018,%2021&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 34:17, 18, 21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'he-goats' means adherents to faith separated from charity, that is, those who set doctrine above life and at length have no interest at all in life. Yet it is life 
that makes the human being, not doctrine separated from life; and it is life that remains after death, not doctrine except insofar as this teaches about life. Of these people it is said that they 
feed off the good pasture and tread down the rest of the pastures with their feet, and that they drink the water that has settled down and stir up the rest with their feet; also that with their horns 
they butt the weak [sheep] till they have scattered them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 From this one may now see which persons are meant by 'the he-goats', and which by 'the sheep', that the Lord speaks of in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Before 
Him will be gathered all the nations, and He will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the he-goats; and He will peace the sheep at His right hand, out the he-goats

</blockquote>
<p>The fact that 'the sheep' means those who have charity and therefore have the truths of faith, and that 'the he-goats' means those who do not have any charity 
even though they have the truths of faith - that is, they are adherents to faith separated from charity - is plain from each detail in this passage, where such people are described. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 Which ones 
are the adherents to faith separated from charity, meant by 'the he-goats', and what kind of people they are, may be seen from the following two places: In Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Every tree that does not male 
good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. Therefore you will know them by their fruits. Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who toes the will 
of My Father who is in heaven Many will say to Me on that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and by Your name cast out demons, and do many mighty works in Your name? But then I will confess 
to them, I do not know you; depart from Me, you workers of iniquity. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%207:19-23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 7:19-23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
Then you will begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to 
us. But He replying will say to you, I do not know where you are from. Then you will begin to say, We ate in Your presence and we drank; and You taught in our streets. But He will say, I tell you, I to 
not know where you come from; depart from Me, all you workers of iniquity. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2013:25-27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 13:25-27</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>These are the ones who adhere to faith separated from charity and are called 'the he-goats'. But what is 
meant by 'he-goats' in the good sense, such as the ones used in sacrifices and those mentioned in various places in the Prophets, will in the Lord's Divine mercy be stated elsewhere.

`Et mactarunt hircum caprarum': quod significet vera externa ex jucundis, constat ex significatione `hirci caprarum' in Verbo quod sint vera naturalia, hoc est, vera externi hominis ex quibus jucunda 
vitae, tum quoque quod sint vera externa ex jucundis, de qua sequitur; vera externi hominis ex quibus jucunda vitae, sunt vera Divina qualia sunt sensus litteralis Verbi, ex quibus doctrinalia 
genuinae Ecclesiae; haec proprie significantur per `hircum,' jucunda {1} quae inde sunt, significantur per `capras'; ita per `hircum caprarum in genuino sensu, illi qui in talibus veris et inde jucundis 
sunt; in sensu autem opposito per `hircum caprarum' significantur illi qui sunt in veris externis, hoc est, in apparentiis veri ex sensu litterae {2} quae jucundis vitae eorum conveniunt, sicut 
quae jucundis corporis, quae in genere voluptates vocantur, et quae jucundis animi, quae in genere (o)sunt honores et lucra; tales per `hircum caprarum' in sensu opposito significantur; verbo, 
per `hircum caprarum' in hoc sensu significantur qui in fide separata a charitate (o)sunt, nam hi non alia (t)vera ex Verbo desumunt quam quae cum jucundis vitae eorum concordant, hoc est, quae favent 
amoribus sui et mundi; cetera vera illuc per interpretationes deducunt, et inde falsitates sistunt sicut apparentias veri.  [2] Quod `hircus caprarum' {3} significet illos qui in fide separata 
sunt, constare potest apud Danielem,           Ecce hircus caprarum venit ab occidente super facies      omnis terrae, et non attingens terram, et huic hirco cornu      aspectus inter oculos illius;... 
ex uno de quatuor cornibus      exivit cornu unum de exiguo, et crevit valde versus meridiem      et versus ortum, et versus decus; quin {4} crevit usque ad      exercitum caelorum, et dejecit 
in terram de exercitu, et de      stellis, et conculcavit ea {5}:... et projecit veritatem in      terram, viii 5, 9, 10, 12; </p>
<p>agitur ibi de statu Ecclesiae in genere, non solum de statu Ecclesiae 
Judaicae sed etiam de statu Ecclesiae sequentis quae est Ecclesia Christiana, nam Verbum Domini est universale; `hircus caprarum' respective ad Ecclesiam Judaicam significat illos qui vera interna 
nihili fecerunt, sed externa acceptabant quatenus favebant amoribus eorum, qui erant ut maximi et opulentissimi essent; inde Christum seu Messiam quem exspectabant, non aliter agnoscebant quam sicut 
regem qui eveheret illos supra omnes gentes et populos in universo terrarum orbe, et hos subjiceret illis sicut vilissimos servos, inde deduxerunt amorem in Illum; quid amor erga proximum, prorsus 
non sciebant, modo quod esset conjunctio per honoris supradicti participationem et per lucrum; [3] `hircus autem caprarum' respective ad Ecclesiam Christianam, significat illos qui in veris externis 
ex jucundis sunt, hoc est, qui in fide separata, nam hi quoque nihil interna curant, sique illa docent, est solum ut inde aucupent famam, ut ad honores evehantur et ad lucra perveniant, haec sunt 
jucunda quae in corde eorum quando vera sunt in ore; et praeterea illa quae genuinae fidei sunt per sinistras interpretationes trahunt ad favorem `suorum amorum'; inde patet quid in sensu interno 
per illa verba apud Danielem significatur, nempe per `hircum caprarum' illi qui in fide separata; quod `hircus venerit ab occidente' est quod a malo; quod `occidens sit malum, videatur n. 3708; 
(o)quod `venerit super facies omnis terrae, non attingens terram' est quod super totam Ecclesiam; per `terram' in Verbo non aliud intelligitur quam terra ubi Ecclesia, ita Ecclesia, {6} n. 566, 662, 
1067, 1262, 1413, 1607, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118 f, 2928, 3355, 4435, 4447; `cornua quae ei', sunt potentiae ex falso, n. 2832; (m)`cornu aspectus inter oculos' est potentia ex ratiocinatione de veris 
fidei, quod constare potest ab illis quae de oculo {7} n. 4403-4421, {8} n. 4523-4534(n) (o)ostensa sunt; </p>
<p>`unum cornu quod crevit versus meridiem, ortum, et decus' est potentia ex fide separata 
{9} usque versus illa quae sunt status lucis caeli, status boni et veri; quod `meridies' sit status lucis, videatur n. 3708, quod `ortus seu oriens' sit status boni, n. 1250, 3249, 3708, quod `decus' 
sit status veri, ex Verbo passim constat {10}; quod `crevit usque ad exercitum caelorum, et dejecit in terram de exercitu, et de stellis, et conculcavit (c)illa' est quod cognitiones boni et veri; 
quod `exercitus caelorum et stellae' sint cognitiones boni et veri, n. 4697; inde scitur quid sit quod `projecerit veritatem in terram,' quod nempe ipsam fidem quae in se est charitas, nam fides 
spectat {11} charitatem quia procedit a {12} charitate; quod in Antiqua Ecclesia vocatum est veritas, hoc in nova vocatur fides, n. 4690.  [4] Similiter (o)hircus apud Ezechielem,           Ecce 
Ego judicans inter pecudem et pecudem, inter arietes      et inter hircos: num parum vobis, pascuum bonum depascitis, et      reliquum pascuorum vestrorum conculcatis pedibus vestris?      sedimentum 
aquarum bibitis, reliquas pedibus vestris      turbatis?... Cornibus vestris feritis omnes infirmas, donec      disperseritis eas foras, xxxiv 17, 18, 21; </p>
<p>ibi etiam per `hircos' significantur illi 
qui in fide separata, hoc est, qui praeponunt doctrinam vitae, et tandem vitam non curant, cum tamen vita facit hominem non doctrina separata, et vita manet post mortem, non autem doctrina nisi 
quantum illa ex vita trahit; </p>
<p>de illis dicitur quod `pascuum bonum depascant, et reliquum pascuorum conculcent pedibus, ac quod sedimentum aquarum bibant, (o)et reliquas pedibus turbent, tum quod `cornibus 
feriant infirmas, donec disperserint illas'. Ex his nunc patet quinam sunt qui per `hircos' et quinam per `oves' intelliguntur, de quibus Dominus apud Matthaeum,           Congregabuntur 
coram Ipso omnes gentes, et separabit eas      ab invicem, sicut pastor separat oves ab hircis; et statuet      oves a dextris [suis], hircos vero a sinistris, etc., xxv 32,      33; </p>
<p>quod `oves' sint 
illi qui in charitate sunt et inde in veris fidei, et quod `hirci qui in nulla charitate tametsi in veris fidei, hoc est, qui in fide separata, a singulis ibi liquet; describuntur ibi illi.  [6] 
Quinam {13} sunt et quales {14} qui in fide separata, et per `hircos' intelliguntur, constare potest ab his binis locis; </p>
<p>apud Matthaeum,           Omnis arbor quae non facit fructum bonum, exscindetur, 
et      in ignem conjicietur; quare ex fructibus eorum cognoscetis      eos: non omnis dicens Mihi, Domine, Domine, intrabit in regnum      caelorum, sed faciens voluntatem Patris Mei Qui in 
caelis est: </p>
<p>     multi dicent Mihi in die illa, Domine, Domine, nonne per nomen      Tuum prophetavimus, et per nomen Tuum daemonia ejecimus, et in      nomine Tuo virtutes multas fecimus? sed tunc 
confitebor illis,      Non novi vos, discedite a Me Operarii iniquitatis{15}, vii      19-23: </p>
<p>et apud Lucam,           Tunc incipietis foris stare, et pulsare januam, dicentes,      Domine, Domine, 
aperi nobis; sed respondens dicet vobis, Non      novi vos unde sitis; tunc incipietis dicere, Edimus coram Te,      et bibimus, et in plateis nostris docuisti; sed dicet, Dico      vobis, non 
novi vos unde sitis, discedite a Me omnes operarii      iniquitatis, xiii 25-27; </p>
<p>hi sunt qui in fide separata, et `hirci' vocantur.  Quid autem `hirci' in bono sensu significant, sicut qui in sacrificiis adhibebantur, 
ac apud Prophetas passim nominantur, alibi {16}, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, dicetur.      @1 vitae$      @2 i Verbi, sed$      @3 i in sensu Verbi interno$      @4 quia
