<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1551节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1551.</strong>“银”表真理。这从“银”表真理的含义清楚可知。上古之人将人里面的良善与真理比作金属；将出于对主之爱的至内在或属天之善比作黄金；将源于它们的真理比作白银；将低级或属世之善比作青铜；将低级的真理比作铁器；他们不仅这样比较，还如此称呼它们。因此，几个时代也被比作这些金属，就是所谓的黄金时代、白银时代、青铜时代和铁器时代；因为这些时代照这样的顺序依次出现。黄金时代是上古教会，就是属天之人的时代；白银时代是古教会，就是属灵之人的时代；青铜时代是后续教会的时代；之后是铁器时代。尼布甲尼撒梦中所看到的雕像也表示类似事物，“它的头是精金的，胸膛和膀臂是银的，腹和腰是铜的，腿是铁的”（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.32.htm">2:32</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.33.htm">33</a>）。教会时代也要按这个顺序依次出现，实际上的确如此。这一点清楚可见于同一先知书的同一章。<br />就圣言的内义而言，“银”无论在哪被提及，都表示真理，或在反面意义上表虚假。这从以下经文明显可知。以赛亚书：<br />我要拿金子代替铜，拿银子代替铁，拿铜代替木头，拿铁代替石头；并要以和平为你的官长，以公义为你的监督。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.17.htm">60:17</a>）<br />此处每种金属的含义是显而易见的，所论述的主题是主的到来，祂的国度和属天的教会。“拿金子代替铜”是指拿属天良善代替属世良善；“拿银子代替铁”是指拿属灵真理代替属世真理；“拿铜代替木头”是指拿属世良善代替肉体良善；“拿铁代替石头”是指拿属世真理代替感官真理。同一先知书：<br />你们一切干渴的都当就近水来，没有银钱的也可以来。你们都来，买了吃！（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛55.1.htm">55:1</a>）<br />“没有银钱的”是指不知道真理，但仍拥有仁之善的人，这是很多教会中人，以及教会外的外邦人的情形。<br /><br />众海岛必等候我，首先是他施的船只，将你的众子连他们的金银从远方一同带来，都为耶和华你神的名，又为以色列的圣者。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.9.htm">60:9</a>）<br />此处具体论述了一个新教会，或外邦人中的教会，普遍论述了主的国度。“他施的船只”表认知，“银”表真理，“金”表良善，因为这些是他们“为耶和华的名而带来”的事物。以西结书：<br />你又将我所给你那华美的金器银器为自己制造男性的像。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.17.htm">16:17</a>）<br />此处“金”表对属天事物的认知，“银”表对属灵事物的认知。同一先知书：<br />你就有金银的妆饰，穿的是细麻衣和丝绸并绣花衣。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.13.htm">16:13</a>）<br />这论及耶路撒冷，以此表示主的教会，其妆饰如此来描述。<br />看哪！你是有智慧的，他们什么秘事都不能向你隐藏。你靠自己的智慧聪明得了金银财宝，收入库中。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.3.htm">28:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.4.htm">4</a>）<br />这说的是推罗，显然，此处“金”是指智慧的财富，“银”是指聪明的财富。<br />约珥书：<br />你们既然夺取我的金银，又将我可爱的宝物带入你们庙中。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥3.5.htm">3:5</a>）<br />这说的是推罗、西顿、非利士，它们表认知，这些认知就是“他们带入庙中的金银”。哈该书：<br />万族的选民必来到，我就使这殿满了荣耀。银子是我的，金子也是我的。这后来的殿的荣耀必大过先前的荣耀。（哈该书<a href="http://39-27.cn/该2.7.htm">2:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/该2.9.htm">9</a>）<br />这论及主的教会，“金子”和“银子”与它有关。玛拉基书：<br />他必坐下如炼净银子的，必洁净利未人。（玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛3.3.htm">3:3</a>）<br />这论及主的到来。诗篇：<br />耶和华的言语是纯净的言语，如同银子在泥炉中炼过七次。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗12.6.htm">12:6</a>）<br />“炼过七次的银子”表神性真理。以色列人出埃及时被命令“各妇女必向祂的邻舍，并居住在她家里的女人要金器银器和衣裳，好给他们的儿女穿戴，这样就把埃及人的财物夺去了”（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出3.22.htm">3:22</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出11.2.htm">11:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出11.3.htm">3</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.35.htm">12:35</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.36.htm">36</a>）。谁都能看出，以色列人绝不会被吩咐以这种方式偷窃和掠夺埃及人的财物，除非它们代表某种奥秘。不过，这些奥秘从“银、金、衣裳和埃及”的含义清楚可知；由此也可以看出，这些财物所代表之物和此处亚伯兰所代表的一样，他从埃及获得的“金、银、牲畜极多”。<br />“银”由于表真理，故在反面意义上表虚假；因为受虚假影响的人视假为真，这也明显可见于先知书。摩西书：<br />你不可贪图这些民族的金银，也不可收取，免得你因此陷入网罗，这原是耶和华你神所憎恶的。你当彻底毁灭它。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.25.htm">7:25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.26.htm">26</a>）<br />“这些民族的金子”表邪恶，“他们的银子”表虚假。摩西书：<br />你们不可贪图列族的银子、金子，也不可收取，免得你因此陷入网罗，这原是耶和华你神所憎恶的；你要十分厌恶、十分憎嫌。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.25.htm">7:25</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.26.htm">26</a>）<br />“列族的金子”表邪恶，其“银子”表虚假。<br />你们不可做银的神像与我相配，你们也不可为自己做金的神像。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出20.23.htm">20:23</a>）<br />就内义而言，这些话无非表虚假和恶欲，“银神像”表虚假，“金神像”表恶欲。以赛亚书：<br />到那日，各人必将他银偶像、金偶像，就是亲手所造、陷自己在罪中的，都抛弃了。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛31.7.htm">31:7</a>）<br />“银偶像、金偶像” 所表之物和前面一样；“亲手所造的”表它们是自我的产物。耶利米书：<br />他们都愚蠢无知，从木头所学的都是徒然的！有银子打成片，是从他施带来的，并有从乌法来的金子，都是都是匠人的作品，银匠的手艺。又有蓝色紫色料的衣服，都是巧匠的工作。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶10.8.htm">10:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶10.9.htm">9</a>）<br />此处“银”和“金”表类似事物，这是很明显的。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1551.</strong> The symbolism of silver as true ideas can be seen from the symbolism of silver as what is true.<br />The earliest people compared the goodness and truth in human beings to different metals. The deepest goodness or blessings, which are heavenly ones, resulting from love for the Lord, they compared to gold. The truth that rises out of these blessings they compared to silver. Lowlier benefits, on the other hand, or earthly blessings, they compared to bronze, while they compared lowlier kinds of truth to iron. What is more, they did not merely compare them to these metals, they also called them by the names of the metals. From this they also derived the practice of comparing different eras to the same metals and calling them the Golden, Silver, Bronze, and Iron Ages, in that order.{*1} The Golden Age was the era of the earliest church, a heavenly race. The Silver Age was the era of the ancient church, which was a spiritual race. The Bronze Age was the era of the next church, and the Iron Age followed it.<br />Similar things were symbolized by the statue Nebuchadnezzar saw in his dream,<br />its head made of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, and its shins of iron. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1551/bible_king-james-version_daniel_2_32-33" target=_top>Daniel 2:32-33</a>)<br />The fact that they would come in this order, or that the different eras of the church had come in this order, can be seen in the same chapter of that prophet.{*2} [2] The following passages show that wherever silver is mentioned in the Word, on an inner level it symbolizes truth, and in an opposite sense falsity. In Isaiah:<br />For bronze I will bring in gold, and for iron I will bring in silver; and for wood, bronze; and for stones, iron. And I will make peace your property,{*3} and justice your taskmaster. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1551/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_60_17" target=_top>Isaiah 60:17</a>)<br />The meaning of each metal is plain to see here. The passage deals with the Lord's Coming, his kingdom, and the heavenly church. "For bronze, gold" is heavenly good in place of earthly good. "For iron, silver" is spiritual truth in place of earthly truth. "For wood, bronze" is earthly good in place of good on the bodily plane. "For stones, iron" is earthly truth in place of truth on the plane of the senses. In the same author:<br />Oh, everyone who is thirsty, come to the water, and whoever does not have silver, come, buy and eat! (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1551/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_55_1" target=_top>Isaiah 55:1</a>)<br />One who lacks silver is one who knows no truth and yet does the good deeds of neighborly love. Many people within the church and many nations outside it are like this.<br />[3] In the same author:<br />For me the islands will await, as will the ships of Tarshish, from the start, to lead your children from far away 钬?their silver and their gold with them 钬?to the name of Jehovah your God and to the Holy One of Israel. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1551/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_60_9" target=_top>Isaiah 60:9</a>)<br />This treats specifically of a new church (or a church among non-Jews) and generally of the Lord's kingdom. Ships of Tarshish stand for religious knowledge, silver for true ideas, and gold for good impulses, which will lead us to the name of Jehovah. In Ezekiel:<br />You took the articles of your finery 钬?made of my gold and of my silver, which I had given to you 钬?and made yourself images of a male. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1551/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_16_17" target=_top>Ezekiel 16:17</a>)<br />The gold here stands for knowledge of heavenly attributes and the silver for knowledge of spiritual ones. In the same author:<br />You were adorned in gold and silver, and your clothing was fine linen and silk and embroidery. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1551/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_16_13" target=_top>Ezekiel 16:13</a>)<br />This is about Jerusalem, which symbolizes the Lord's church, whose finery is depicted this way. In the same author:<br />How wise you are! Nothing secret has lain hidden from you. In your wisdom and in your understanding you have made yourself riches, and you have made gold and silver for your treasuries. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1551/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_28_3-4" target=_top>Ezekiel 28:3-4</a>)<br />This passage concerns Tyre. Clearly the gold mentioned in it is a wealth of wisdom and the silver is a wealth of understanding.<br />[4] In Joel:<br />My silver and my gold you have stolen, and my good, desirable things you have taken into your temples. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1551/bible_king-james-version_joel_3_5" target=_top>Joel 3:5</a>)<br />This is about Tyre, Sidon, and Philistia. They symbolize religious knowledge, which is the gold and silver they took into their temples. In Haggai:<br />Those who are the choice of every nation will come, and I will fill this House with glory. Mine is the silver and mine the gold. Greater will the glory of this later house be than that of the earlier. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1551/bible_king-james-version_haggai_2_7" target=_top>Haggai 2:7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1551/bible_king-james-version_haggai_2_8" target=_top>8</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1551/bible_king-james-version_haggai_2_9" target=_top>9</a>)<br />This is about the Lord's church, with which the gold and silver are associated. In Malachi:<br />He will sit smelting and refining silver and will purify the children of Levi. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1551/bible_king-james-version_malachi_3_3" target=_top>Malachi 3:3</a>)<br />This passage tells of the Lord's Coming. In David:<br />Jehovah's words: pure words, silver smelted in a crucible of earth, melted seven times. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1551/bible_king-james-version_psalms_12_6" target=_top>Psalms 12:6</a>)<br />Silver purified seven times stands for divine truth. When the children of Israel left Egypt, they were given this command:<br />Seek 钬?a woman from her neighbor, and from her houseguest 钬?articles of silver and articles of gold and clothes, and place them on their sons and on their daughters, and plunder the Egyptians. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1551/bible_king-james-version_exodus_3_22" target=_top>Exodus 3:22</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1551/bible_king-james-version_exodus_11_2-3" target=_top>11:2-3</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1551/bible_king-james-version_exodus_12_35-36" target=_top>12:35-36</a>)<br />Anyone can see that the children of Israel would never have been told to rob and plunder the Egyptians in this way if such actions had not represented something hidden. What hidden meaning they represented can be deduced from the symbolism of silver, gold, clothes, and Egypt.{*4} Obviously it all represented something similar to Abram's heaviness here in silver and gold brought from Egypt.<br />[5] Just as silver symbolizes truth, in the opposite sense it symbolizes falsity, because people whose thinking is false consider falsity true, and this too can be seen in [Moses and] the prophets. In Moses:<br />You shall not covet the silver and gold of the nations or take it for yourself; otherwise you might be ensnared by it, because it is an abomination to Jehovah your God. You shall utterly detest it. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1551/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_7_25-26" target=_top>Deuteronomy 7:25-26</a>)<br />The gold of the nations stands for evil and their silver for falsity. In the same author:<br />You shall not make gods of silver beside me; and gods of gold you shall not make for yourselves. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1551/bible_king-james-version_exodus_20_23" target=_top>Exodus 20:23</a>)<br />These words mean nothing at all in the inner sense if they do not mean false notions and corrupt desires; false notions are gods of silver, and corrupt desires are gods of gold. In Isaiah:<br />On that day they will each repudiate their silver idols and their gold idols that your hands made for you 钬?a sin. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1551/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_31_7" target=_top>Isaiah 31:7</a>)<br />Silver idols and gold idols stand for something similar. "Your hands made them" stands for the fact that they originate in self-centeredness. In Jeremiah:<br />They are becoming foolish and growing stupid. Their education in worthless things is a piece of wood. Silver beaten thin is brought from Tarshish and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artist and of the metalsmith's hands; blue-violet and red-violet fabric is their clothing 钬?all of them the work of the wise. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1551/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_10_8-9" target=_top>Jeremiah 10:8-9</a>)<br />Obviously, these words have a similar meaning.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} One of the earliest mentions in Western literature of four ages denoted by metals is the famous passage in the Works and Days (Hesiod 1914) 109-201 of the Greek poet Hesiod (flourished around 700 b.c.e.). According to Hesiod, the people of the Golden Age "lived like gods without sorrow of heart" and supposedly survived in the form of "pure spirits dwelling on the earth, ... kindly, delivering from harm, and guardians of mortal men." The next race, of silver, was "less noble by far," took a long time to reach maturity, and then "lived only a little time in sorrow because of their foolishness." The silver race was replaced by one of bronze, "terrible and strong. They loved the lamentable works of Ares [the god of war] and deeds of violence: they ate no bread, but were hard of heart like adamant, fearful men." After the bronze race came the age of heroes, associated with the great legends of Greek myth such as the Homeric poems, and finally, our own, "a race of iron," when "men never rest from labour and sorrow by day, and from perishing by night." For other classical references to the theme, see Vergil Eclogues 4; Ovid Metamorphoses 1:89-112. Swedenborg discusses these ages again in 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1551/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5658#subsection-2-2" target=_top>5658:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1551/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_10355#subsection-2-2" target=_top>10355:2-3</a>, and in several of his other works, including Worship and Love of God 1-2; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1551/swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_115" target=_top>Heaven and Hell 115</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1551/swedenborg_conjugial-love-rogers_75" target=_top>Marriage Love 75-76</a>; and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1551/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_762" target=_top>True Christianity 762</a>.

In silver. That this signifies truths, is evident from the signification of "silver," as being truth. The most ancient people compared the goods and truths in man to metals; the inmost or the celestial 
goods, which are of love to the Lord, to gold; the truths which are from these, to silver; but the lower or natural goods, to copper; and the lower truths, to iron; nor did they simply compare them, 
but they likewise called them so. Hence periods of time were also likened to the same metals, and were called the golden, the silver, the copper, and the iron ages; for the ages followed one another 
in this order. The golden age was the time of the Most Ancient Church, which was a celestial man; the silver age was the time of the Ancient Church, which was a spiritual man; the copper age was the 
time of the succeeding church; and to this succeeded the iron age. Similar things are also signified by the statue seen by Nebuchadnezzar in a dream, whose "head was of good gold, the breast and arms 
of silver, the belly and thighs of brass, the legs of iron" (Dan. 2:32-33). That this was to be the series, or that the periods of the church succeeded one another in this order, is evident from the same 
Prophet, and in the same chapter.  [2] That in the internal sense of the Word, "silver," wherever named, signifies truth, and in the opposite sense falsity, is evident from the following passages. 
In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron; I will also make thine officers peace, and thine exactors righteousness (Isa. 
60:17); </p>
<p>where it is evident what each metal means. The Lord's coming, and His celestial kingdom and church, are there treated of; "gold for brass," is celestial good instead of natural good; "silver 
for iron," is spiritual truth instead of natural truth; "brass for wood," is natural good instead of corporeal good; "iron for stones," is natural truth instead of sensuous truth. In the same: </p>
<p>     
Ho, everyone that thirsteth, go ye to the waters; and he that hath no silver; go ye, buy and eat (Isa. 55:1); </p>
<p>"he that hath no silver," is he who is in ignorance of truth, and yet in the good of charity, 
like many within the church, and the nations outside the church.  [3] In the same: </p>
<p>     The isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish in the beginning, to bring thy sons from far, their 
silver and their gold with them, unto the name of Jehovah thy God, and to the Holy One of Israel (Isa. 60:9). Here a new church, or that of the Gentiles, is treated of specifically, and the Lord's 
kingdom universally; "the ships from Tarshish" denote knowledges; "silver," truths; and "gold," goods; for these are the things which they shall "bring to the name of Jehovah." In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Thou 
didst take the vessels of thine adorning of My gold and of My silver, which I had given thee, and madest for thee images of a male (Ezek. 16:17). Here "gold" denotes the knowledges of celestial things; 
"silver," those of spiritual things. In the same: </p>
<p>     Thou wast adorned with gold and silver, and thy raiment was fine linen and silk, and broidered work (Ezek. 16:13). This is said of Jerusalem, 
by which the Lord's church is signified, and the adornment of which is thus described. Again: </p>
<p>     Behold, thou art wise, there is no secret that they have hidden from thee; in thy wisdom and in thine 
intelligence thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures (Ezek. 28:3-4). This is said of Tyre, and it is plain that here "gold" is the wealth of wisdom, and "silver" 
the wealth of intelligence.  [4] In Joel: </p>
<p>     Ye have taken My silver and My gold, and have carried into your temples My goodly desirable things (Joel 3:5). This is said concerning Tyre, Zidon, 
and Philistia; by which are signified knowledges, which are "the gold and the silver" that they have carried into their temples. In Haggai: </p>
<p>     The choice of all nations shall come, and I will 
fill this house with glory; the silver is Mine and the gold is Mine; the glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the former (Hag. 2:7-9); </p>
<p>where the Lord's church is treated of, concerning 
which "gold" and "silver" are predicated. In Malachi: </p>
<p>     He shall sit as a smelter and purifier of silver, and shall purify the sons of Levi (Mal. 3:3); </p>
<p>where the Lord's coming is treated of. 
In David: </p>
<p>     The discourses of Jehovah are pure discourses, silver smelted in a crucible of earth, smelted seven times (Ps. 12:6); </p>
<p>the "silver purified seven times," denotes Divine truth. In respect 
to the command given to the sons of Israel, when they were to go out of Egypt: </p>
<p>     Every woman shall borrow of her neighbor, and of her that is a guest in her house, vessels of silver and vessels 
of gold, and garments; and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters, and shall spoil the Egyptians (Exod. 3:22; 11:2-3; 12:35-36); </p>
<p>everyone can see that the sons of Israel would 
by no means have been told thus to steal, and to spoil the Egyptians, unless some arcana were thus to be represented; but what the arcana are may be seen from the signification of "silver," of "gold," 
and of "garments," and of "Egypt;" and it may also be seen that much the same was there represented as is here represented by Abram, who was rich in silver and gold from Egypt.  [5] As "silver" signifies 
truth, so in the opposite sense it signifies falsity; for they who are in falsity think that falsity is truth; as is also evident in the Prophets. In Moses: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt not covet the silver 
and the gold of the nations, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein; for it is an abomination to Jehovah thy God; detesting thou shalt detest it (Deut. 7:25-26); </p>
<p>"the gold of the nations" 
denotes evils, and their "silver" falsities. Again: </p>
<p>     Ye shall not make with Me gods of silver, and gods of gold shall ye not make unto you (Exod. 20:23); </p>
<p>by which in the internal sense nothing 
else is signified than falsities and cupidities; "gods of silver" are falsities; and "gods of gold" are cupidities. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     In that day shall they cast away every man his idols of silver and 
his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you for a sin (Isa. 31:7); </p>
<p>"idols of silver and idols of gold," denote similar things as before; "your own hands have made them," means that they 
are from man's Own. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     They are become brutish and foolish; a teaching of vanities is that stock; silver beaten out is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artificer 
and of the hands of the founder; blue and crimson are their clothing, it is all the work of the wise (Jer. 10:8-9); </p>
<p>denoting the like things, as is very evident. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1551</b></p><p><b>1551.</b>
That 'silver' means truths is clear from the meaning of 'silver' as truth. The most ancient people compared the goods and truths present in man to metals. Innermost or celestial goods which flow from 
love to the Lord they compared to gold, truths deriving from these to silver. Goods of a lower or natural kind however they compared to bronze, and truths of a lower kind to iron. Nor did they just compare 
them; they also called them such. This was the origin of periods of time being likened to those same metals and being called the golden, silver, bronze, and iron ages, for these followed in that 
order one after another. The golden age was the time of the Most Ancient Church, which was celestial man. The silver age was the time of the Ancient Church, which was spiritual man. The bronze age was 
the time of the Church that followed, and the iron age came after that. Similar things were also meant by the statue which Nebuchadnezzar saw in a dream, whose head was of fine gold, breast and arms 
of silver, belly and thighs of bronze, and shins of iron, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%202:32,%2033&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 2:32, 33</a>. That periods of the Church were to follow one another in that order, and actually did so, is clear in that very chapter of the 
same prophet. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That 'silver' in the internal sense of the Word wherever it is mentioned means truth, or in the contrary sense falsity, is clear from the following places: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Instead 
of bronze I will bring gold, and instead of iron I will bring silver, and instead of wood, bronze, and instead of stones, iron. And I will make peace your assessment, and righteousness your tax-collectors. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2060:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 60:17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here it is evident what each metal means The subject is the Lord's Coming, His kingdom, and the celestial Church. 'Instead of bronze, gold' is celestial good in place of natural 
good; 'instead of iron, silver' is spiritual truth in place of natural truth; 'instead of wood, bronze' is natural good in place of bodily good; 'instead of stone, iron' is natural truth in place of truth 
acquired through the senses. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Ho, everyone who thirsts, come to the water, and he who has no money,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> come, buy and eat! <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2055:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 55:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'He who has no money'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> is the person who 
does not know the truth but who nevertheless possesses the good that stems from charity, as is the case with many people inside the Church, and with gentiles outside it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The 
islands will wait for Me, the ships of Tarshish at their head, to bring your sons from afar, their silver and their gold with them, to the name of Jehovah your God, and to the Holy One of Israel 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2060:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 60:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers specifically to a new Church, or a Church among gentiles, and in general to the Lord's kingdom. 'Ships from Tarshish' stands for cognitions, 'silver' for truths, and 'gold' 
for goods, which are those things they 'will bring to the name of Jehovah'. In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
For your adornment you took vessels made of My gold and of My silver, which I had given you, and you made for 
yourselves figures of the male. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2016:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 16:17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'gold' stands for cognitions of celestial things, 'silver' of spiritual things. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
You were adorned with gold and silver, and 
your raiment was fine linen and silk, and embroidered cloth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2016:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 16:13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Jerusalem, by which the Lord's Church is meant, whose adornment is being described in this manner. In the 
same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, you who are wise, there is no secret they have hidden from you; by your wisdom and by your intelligence you have acquired riches for yourself, and you have acquired gold and 
silver in your treasuries. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2028:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 28:3, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here, in what is said in reference to Tyre, 'gold' is plainly identified with the riches of wisdom, and 'silver' with the riches of intelligence. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In 
Joel, </p>
<blockquote>
You have taken My silver and My gold, and My good and desirable treasures you have carried into your temples <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%203:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 3:5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Tyre, Sidon, and Philistia, which mean cognitions, and 
these are 'the silver and the gold they took into their temples'. In Haggai, </p>
<blockquote>
The elect of all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory. Mine is the silver, and Mine is the gold. The 
glory of this latter house will be greater than that of the former <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hagg%202:7-9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hagg 2:7-9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord's Church to which 'gold and silver' have reference. In Malachi, </p>
<blockquote>
He will sit as a refiner 
and purifier of silver, and He will purify the sons of Levi. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mal%203:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mal 3:3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Coming of the Lord. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
The words of Jehovah are pure words, silver refined in an earthen crucible, 
poured seven times. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2012:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 12:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Silver purified seven times' stands for Divine truth. At the time of their exodus out of Egypt the children of Israel were commanded that every woman should ask of 
her neighbour, and of her who sojourned in her house, vessels of silver and vessels of gold and garments, and that they should put them on their sons and on their daughters, and so despoil the Egyptians, 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%203:22;%2011:2,%203;%2012:35,%2036&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 3:22; 11:2, 3; 12:35, 36</a>. Anyone may see from the children of Israel would never have been ordered to steal and despoil the Egyptians of those possessions in that way if these did not represent 
some arcana. But what those arcana are may become clear from the meaning of 'silver and gold, garments, and Egypt', and from the fact that what these possessions represented is similar to the words 
here 'rich in the silver and gold from Egypt', used in reference to Abram. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Just as 'silver' means truth so in a contrary sense it means falsity, for people under the influence of falsity imagine 
falsity to be the truth, as is also clear in the Prophets. In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
You shall not covet the silver and the gold of the nations, nor take it for yourself, lest you be ensnared by it, for it is 
an abomination to Jehovah your God. You shall utterly detest it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%207:25,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 7:25, 26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The gold of the nations' stands for evils, and 'their silver' for falsities. In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
You shall not 
make gods of silver to be with Me, nor shall you make for yourselves gods of gold. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2020:23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 20:23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the internal sense these words mean nothing other than falsities and evil desires, falsities being 
meant by 'gods of silver', and evil desires by 'gods of gold'. In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
On that day everyone will spurn his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your hands have made for you - a sin. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2031:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 31:7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Idols of silver and idols of gold' stands for similar things that are false and evil 'Which your hands have made' stands for what is a product of the proprium. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
They are foolish 
and stupid; that wood is a way of learning vanities! Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the smith and of the hands of the moulder. Their clothing is violet 
and purple These are all the work of the wise. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2010:8,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 10:8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'silver' and 'gold' quite clearly stand for similar things that are false and evil.

'Argento': quod significet vera, constat a significatione 'argenti' quod sit verum: antiquissimi compararunt bona et vera apud hominem metallis: bona intima seu caelestia quae sunt amoris in Dominum, 
'auro': vera quae inde, 'argento': bona autem inferiora seu naturalia, 'aeri': vera autem inferiora, 'ferro'; nec solum comparabant sed ita quoque appellabant; inde derivatum quod tempora quoque assimilata 
fuerint eisdem metallis, et appellata 'saecula aurea, argentea, aerea, et ferrea; nam ita sibi successerunt'; 'saeculum aureum' fuit tempus Antiquissimae Ecclesiae, quae caelestis homo: 'saeculum 
argenteum' fuit tempus Antiquae Ecclesiae, quae spiritualis homo: 'saeculum aeris' fuit tempus Ecclesiae sequentis: cui successit 'saeculum ferreum.' Similia quoque significata sunt per 'statuam' 
in somnio visam Nebuchadnezzari, Cujus caput de auro bono; pectus et brachia de argento; venter et femora de aere; tibiae de ferro, Dan. ii 32, 33; </p>
<p>quod ita successura, aut quod ita successerint tempora 
Ecclesiae, apud eundem Prophetam in capite illo constat. [2] Quod 'argentum' significet in sensu interno Verbi ubicumque nominatur, verum, et in opposito sensu falsum, constat ex his locis; apud 
Esaiam, Pro aere adducam aurum, et pro ferro adducam argentum, et pro lignis aes; et pro lapidibus, ferrum; et ponam censum tuum, pacem, et exactores tuos justitiam, lx 17; </p>
<p>ubi patet quid unumquodvis 
metallum; ibi de Adventu Domini, et Ipsius regno et Ecclesia caelesti agitur; 'pro aere aurum' est pro bono naturali bonum caeleste; 'pro ferro argentum' est pro vero naturali verum spirituale; 'pro 
ligno aes' est pro corporeo bono naturale bonum; 'pro lapidibus ferrum' est pro sensuali vero naturale verum: apud eundem, Heu omnis sitiens, ite ad aquas, et cui non ei argentum, ite, emite, et comedite, 
lv 1; </p>
<p>'cui non argentum' est qui in ignorantia veri, et tamen in bono charitatis, sicut plures intra Ecclesiam, et gentes extra Ecclesiam: apud eundem,  [3] Me insulae exspectabunt, et naves 
Tarshish in principio, ad adducendum filios tuos e longinquo, argentum eorum, et aurum eorum cum illis, Nomini Jehovae Dei tui, et Sancto Israelis, lx 9; </p>
<p>ibi de Ecclesia nova seu gentium in specie, de 
regno Domini in universali; 'naves de Tarshish' pro cognitionibus; 'argentum' pro veris, 'aurum' pro bonis, quae sunt 'quae adducent Nomini Jehovae': apud Ezechielem, Accepisti vasa ornatus tui ex 
auro Meo, et ex argento Meo quae dederam tibi, et fecisti tibi imagines masculi, xvi 17; </p>
<p>ibi 'aurum' pro cognitionibus caelestium, 'argentum' pro spiritualium apud eundem, Ornata es auro et argento, 
et vestis tua byssus et sericum et acupictum, xvi 13; </p>
<p>de Hierosolyma per quam significatur Ecclesia Domini, cujus ornatu ita describitur: apud eundem, Ecce sapiens tu,...ullum occultum non latuerunt 
te, in sapientia tua, et in intelligentia tua fecisti tibi opes, et fecisti aurum et argentum in thesauris tuis, xxviii 3, 4; </p>
<p>de Tyro, ubi manifeste quod 'aurum' sint opes sapientiae, et 'argentum' 
opes intelligentiae: apud Joelem, [4] Argentum Meam, et aurum Meum sumpsistis, et desiderabilia Mea bona intulistis in templa vestra, iv 5 [A.V. iii 5]; </p>
<p>de Tyro, Zidone et Philistaea per quas significantur 
cognitiones, quae sunt 'aurum et argentum, quod intulerunt in templa sua': apud Haggaeum, Venient electio omnium gentium, et implebo domum hanc gloria, Mihi argentum, et Mihi aurum, magna erit 
gloria domus hujus posterioris prae prioris, ii [7,] 8, 9; </p>
<p>ubi de Ecclesia Domini, de qua praedicatur 'aurum et argentum': apud Malachiam, Sedebit conflans et emundans argentum, et purificabit filios 
Levi, iii 3; </p>
<p>ubi de Adventu Domini: apud Davidem, Sermones Jehovae, sermones puri, argentum conflatum in catino terrae, fusum septies, Ps. xii 7 [A.V. 6]; </p>
<p>'argentum purificatum septies' pro veritate 
Divina. Quod mandatum filiis Israelis cum exirent Aegypto, quod Peteret mulier a vicina sua, et ab hospita domus suae, vasa argenti, et vasa auri, et vestes, et ponerent super filiis suis, et 
super filiabus suis, et spoliarent Aegyptios, Exod. iii 22; xi 2, 3; xii 35, 36; </p>
<p>quisque videre potest quod nusquam filiis Israelis dictum fuerit ita furari, et spoliare Aegyptios, nisi repraesentarent 
aliqua arcana; at quae arcana, constare potest a significatione 'argenti, et auri, et vestium et Aegypti,' et quod simile quid repraesentaverint, ac quod hic Abramus, quod 'gravis argento et auro ex 
Aegypto.' [5] Sicut argentum significat verum, ita in sensu opposito significat falsum, nam qui in falso sunt, putant falsum esse verum, ut quoque constat apud Prophetas; apud Mosen, Non concupisces 
gentium argentum et aurum, et accipias tibi, ne forte illaqueeris illo, quia abominatio Jehovae Dei tui illud,...detestando detestaberis illud, Deut. vii 25, 26; </p>
<p>'gentium aurum' pro malis, et 'earum 
argentum' pro falsis: apud eundem, Non facietis Mecum, deos argenti, et deos auri non facietis vobis, Exod. xx 23; </p>
<p>per quae in sensu interno nihil aliud significantur quam falsitates et cupiditates; 
falsitates sunt 'dii argenti,' et cupiditates sunt 'dii auri': apud Esaiam, Die illo reprobabunt quisque idola argenti sui, et idola auri sui, quae fecerunt vobis manus vestrae, peccatum, xxxi 7; </p>
<p>'idola 
argenti et idola auri' pro similibus; 'quod fecerint manus vestrae' pro quod ex proprio: apud Jeremiam, Infatuantur et stultescunt, disciplina vanitatum lignum illud, argentum extensum de Tarshish 
adfertur, et aurum de Uphaso, opus fabri et manuum conflatoris; hyacinthinum et purpura vestis eorum, opus sapientum tota, x 8, 9; </p>
<p>pro similibus, ut manifeste constat. </p>
