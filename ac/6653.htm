<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6653节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6653.</strong>“他对他的百姓说”表从属的记忆知识。这从“百姓”的含义清楚可知，“百姓”（经上或译人民，民等）是指真理，在反面意义上是指虚假（<a href="1259.htm">1259</a>，<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>，<a href="3295.htm">3295</a>，<a href="3581.htm">3581</a>节），在此是指与真理分离的记忆知识，因为这百姓是埃及的百姓。“埃及”是指记忆知识（参看<a href="6638.htm">6638</a>节）。他们之所以表示从属的记忆知识，是因为经上说“王对他的百姓说”。“百姓”表示真理是因为，在圣言中，“百姓或人民”这个词用来论及那些服从一个国王的人，而“王”表示真理（<a href="6651.htm">6651</a>节）。“百姓或人民”虽表示真理，但其实是指那些拥有真理的人。然而，抽象谈论真理的原因是，灵人和天使就是如此思考和谈论它们的。因为他们以这种方式会对一个主题获得一个完整的总体概念，同时又能看到属于该主题的具体细节，而不用具体地考虑拥有真理的任何人；因为这种考虑会使他们的心智偏离，看不到完整的全貌，从而看不到这个主题的视野延伸，由此得不到智慧。因为心智集中于任何具体的人，或具体地集中于任何人会缩小和限制他们的观念，剥夺他们对一个主题从这一边到那一边的全方位觉知。“百姓或人民”的观念是这种情况，在内义上表示无尽事物的其它术语也是这种情况；如表示良善的“民族”，表示真理的“王”，表示首要真理的“首领”，表示良善的“祭司”，“儿子”、“女儿”、“女婿”、“儿媳”、“弟兄”、“姐妹”、“父亲”、“母亲”，以及其它许多术语。</p>

And he said unto his people. That this signifies subordinate memory-knowledges, is evident from the signification of "people," as being truths, and in the opposite sense falsities (n. 1259, 1260, 3295, 
3581), here memory-knowledges separated from truth, because it is the people of Egypt. (That "Egypt" is memory-knowledge, see n. 6638.) That they are subordinate memory-knowledges is because it is 
said that "the king said unto his people." That by "people" are signified truths, is because in the word those are called a "people" who are under a king, and by a "king" is signified truth (n. 6651). 
By a "people" are signified truths, but those are meant who are in truths. The reason why truths are spoken of abstractedly, is that spirits and angels so think and speak, for in this way they comprehend 
a subject in a universal manner, and at the same time singly the particulars belonging to it, without reflecting specifically on any people that is in truths, which reflection would withdraw the 
mind from a universal idea, thus from extension of view, consequently from wisdom. For determination of the thought to any specific people, as also to any person, limits and confines the ideas, and turns 
them from the perception of a subject as it is from one boundary to the other. As is the case with the idea of a "people," so is it with other denominations which in the internal sense signify things 
unbounded - as with a "nation" as being good, with a "king" as being truth, with a "prince" as being primary truth, with a "priest" as being good, and with a "son," "daughter," "son-in-law," "daughter-in-law," 
"brother," "sister," "father," "mother," and many other denominations. </p>

'And he said to his people' means subordinated factual knowledge. This is clear from the meaning of 'people' as truths, and in the contrary sense as falsities, dealt with in <a href="1259.htm">1259</a>, <a href="1260.htm">1260</a>, <a href="7295.htm">7295</a>, <a href="7581.htm">7581</a>, here 
factual knowledge separated from truth since it is the people of Egypt. 'Egypt' means factual knowledge, see <a href="6638.htm">6638</a>; but the reason why subordinated factual knowledge is meant here is that the words 
'the king said to his people' are used. 'People' means truths because in the Word the term 'people' is used of those who are subject to a king, and 'a king' means truth, <a href="6651.htm">6651</a>. But though 'people' means 
truths, one understands those in possession of truths. The reason however why truths are spoken of in isolation from anything else is that this is how spirits and angels think and speak of them. For 
by doing that they gain a complete overall view of a subject, and at the same time see specific details belonging to that subject. They do not contemplate any people in particular who are in possession 
of truths; for any such contemplation would divert their minds from seeing the complete overall picture, thus from seeing the lull extent of the subject, and so from gaining wisdom. For a concentration 
of the mind on any people in particular, or on any person in particular, narrows and restricts their ideas, and deprives them of a perception of the full range of the subject from one edge of it 
to the other. What applies to 'people' applies in a similar way to other terms, in that in the internal sense they mean entities unlimited by anything else, as is the case with nation (meaning good), 
king (meaning truth), prince (meaning a leading truth), priest (meaning good), son, daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother, sister, father, mother, and very many others.  </p>

</p><b>6653.</b>
`Et dixit ad populum suum': quod significet scientifica subordinata, constat ex significatione `populi' quod sint vera, et in opposito sensu falsa, de qua n. 1259, 1260, 3295, 3581, hic scientifica separata 
a vero, quia est populus Aegypti; {1}quod `Aegyptus' sit scientificum, videatur n. 6638'; quod sint {2}scientifica quae' sub ordinata, est quia dicitur quod `rex dixit ad populum suum.'  Quod 
per `populum' significentur vera, est quia in Verbo populus vocatur qui sub rege est, et per `regem' significatur verum, n. 6651.  {3} Per `populum' {4}significantur vera, {5}sed intelliguntur illi qui 
in veris sunt; {6}quod vera dicantur abstracte, est quia ita cogitant et loquuntur spiritus et angeli; {7}sic enim universaliter rem comprehendunt, (c)et simul tunc singulariter illa quae ad rem pertinent, 
absque reflexione ad aliquem populum qui est in veris, in specie, quae reflexio abstraheret mentem ab idea universali, ita ab extensione intuitionis, proinde a sapientia; nam determinatio cogitationis 
ad aliquem populum in specie, ut quoque ad aliquam personam, limitat et finit ideas, et avertit a perceptione rei, qualis {8} est a termino uno ad alterum.  Similiter ac cum populo, se habet 
{9} cum aliis {10} (x)denominationibus, quod in sensu interno interminata significent, sicut cum gente quod sit bonum, cum rege quod sit verum, cum principe quod sit primarium verum, cum sacerdote quod 
sit bonum {11}, cumque filio, filia, (d)genero, nuru, {12}fratre, sorore, patre, matre, et pluribus aliis. 	@1 vera enim interioris naturalis non alia sunt quam scientifica$ 	@2 quae sunt$ 	@3 i 
Quod dicatur, quod$ 	@4 significentur$ 	@5 est quia per populum$ 	@6 sed vera dicuntur$ 	@7 causa est quoniam sic$ 	@8 i ea$ 	@9 i in sensu interno$ 	@10 vocibus quae terminata involvunt$ 	@11
