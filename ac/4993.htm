<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4993节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4993.</strong>“他把所有的都交在我手里”表一切事物都服从它的权柄和掌控。这从前面所述（<a href="4978.htm">4978</a>节）清楚可知，那里有相似的话。不同之处在于，那里所论述的主题是属世层里面的属灵层的属天层所经历的第二个状态；因为那时，属世良善将自己应用于真理，并将这真理变成它自己的（<a href="4976.htm">4976</a>，<a href="4977.htm">4977</a>节）。在此状态下，良善实际掌权，而真理表面上掌权；这就是为何那里的话表示属于那良善的一切事物似乎都服从它的权柄和掌控。然而，由于此处论述的主题是属灵层的属天层所经历的第三个状态；此时，存在于属世层里面的那良善已变得属灵。由于在这种状态下，属灵的属世良善不将任何事物变成自己的，所以现在所用的这些话表示一切都服从属灵层的属天层的权柄和掌控。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4993</b></p><p><b>4993.</b>
And all that he hath he hath given into my hand. That this signifies that all was in its power, is evident from what was said above (n. 4978), where similar words occur. But there is this difference, 
that the subject there treated of was the second state in which was the celestial of the spiritual in the natural; for then natural good applied itself, and appropriated to itself truth (n. 4976, 4977); 
in which state good had the dominion actually, but truth apparently; and therefore these words then signified that its all was as it were in its power. But here the subject treated of is the third 
state in which is the celestial of the spiritual, when it has become spiritual in the natural; and as in this state there is no appropriation, therefore by these words is signified that all was in its power. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4993</b></p><p><b>4993.</b>
'And all that he has he has given into my hand' means that everything was subject to its power and control. This is clear from what has been stated above in <a href="4978.htm">4978</a>, where similar words occur. But the difference 
is that there the subject is the second state which the celestial of the spiritual within the natural passed through, for at that point natural good applied itself to truth and made this its 
own, <a href="4976.htm">4976</a>, <a href="4977.htm">4977</a>. In that state good in actual fact had dominion, though truth appeared to do so, which was why the words used there meant that everything belonging to that good was seemingly subject 
to its power and control. Now however the subject is the third state which the celestial of the spiritual passed through when that good present within the natural was made spiritual. And because in this 
state spiritual natural good makes nothing its own, the words now used therefore mean that all was subject to the power and control of the celestial of the spiritual. </p>

</p><b>4993.</b>
`Et omne quod est illi dedit in manum meam': quod significet quod omne in ejus potestate, constat ex illis quae supra n. 4978 dicta sunt, ubi similia verba; sed illa differentia et quod ibi agatur 
de altero statu in quo fuit caeleste spiritualis in naturali, tunc enim bonum naturale applicuit se, et sibi appropriavit verum, n. 4976, 4977, in quo statu bonum dominium habuit actualiter sed verum 
apparenter, quapropter tunc significabatur per illa verba `quod omne suum sicut in ejus potestate esset'; hic autem agitur de tertio statu in quo est caeleste spiritualis cum illud in naturali 
factum est spirituale, et quia in hoc statu nulla appropriatio et, idcirco per illa verba significatur quod omne in ejus potestate esset. </p>
