<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1574.</strong>“迦南人”表外在人中源自母亲的遗传之恶，如前所述（<a href="1444.htm">1444</a>节）；而“比利洗人”表源自邪恶的虚假，这从圣言中提及比利洗人的经文清楚可知。如关于雅各的经文：<br />雅各对西缅和利未说，你们连累我，使我在这地的居民中，就是在迦南人和比利洗人中，有了臭名。我的人丁既然稀少，他们必聚集来击杀我，我和全家的人都必灭绝。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创34.30.htm">34:30</a>）<br />此处“迦南人”同样表邪恶，“比利洗人”表虚假。<br />约书亚记：<br />约书亚对约瑟的子孙说，如果你们人数多，嫌以法莲山地窄小，就可以上比利洗人、利乏音人之地，在森林中砍伐树木。（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书17.15.htm">17:15</a>）<br />此处“比利洗人”表谬念，“利乏音人”表他们要除掉的虚假说服，因为“以法莲山”的属灵之义是指聪明。<br />士师记：<br />约书亚死后，以色列人求问耶和华说，我们中间谁当首先上去攻击迦南人，与他争战？耶和华说，犹大当先上去，看哪，我已将那地交在他手中。犹大对他哥哥西缅说，请你同我到我拈阄所得之地去，好与迦南人争战；以后我也同你到你拈阄所得之地去。于是西缅与他同去。犹大就上去。耶和华将迦南人和比利洗人交在他们手中。（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士1.1.htm">1:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/士1.4.htm">4</a>）<br />此处“犹大”也代表主的属天之物，“西缅”代表衍生的属灵之物。“迦南人”是指邪恶，“比利洗人”是指被战胜的虚假。这就是理解回应或神谕的方式。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1574.</strong> The symbolism of a Canaanite as evil in his outer self, inherited from his mother, was shown above at 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1574/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1444" target=_top>1444</a>. The symbolism of a Perizzite as falsity coming out of that evil, though, can be seen from other passages in the Word mentioning a Perizzite. Concerning Jacob, for instance:<br />Jacob said to Simeon and to Levi, "You have caused me trouble, making me stink with the inhabitant of the land 钬?with the Canaanites and with the Perizzites 钬?and my numbers are few; and they will gather against me and strike me, and I will be destroyed, I and my household." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1574/bible_king-james-version_genesis_34_30" target=_top>Genesis 34:30</a>)<br />Here too a Canaanite symbolizes evil, and a Perizzite, falsity.<br />[2] In Joshua:<br />Joshua said to Joseph's children, "If you are a numerous people, go up into the forest, and you are to carve out [a place] for yourself there in the land of the Perizzite and the Rephaim, if Mount Ephraim is too narrow for you." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1574/bible_king-james-version_joshua_17_15" target=_top>Joshua 17:15</a>)<br />The Perizzites symbolize falsity as a premise, while the Rephaim symbolize falsity as a conviction. These they were to annihilate, because in an inner sense Mount Ephraim is the capacity for understanding.<br />[3] In Judges:<br />After Joshua's death, the children of Israel asked Jehovah a question, saying, "Who will go up to the Canaanites for us at first, to fight against them?" And Jehovah said, "Judah will go up. See? I've given the land into his hand." And Judah said to Simeon his brother, "Go up with me into my allotment and we'll fight against the Canaanite, and I, yes I, will go with you into your allotment." And Simeon went with him, and Judah went up, and Jehovah gave the Canaanite and the Perizzite into their hand. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1574/bible_king-james-version_judges_1_1" target=_top>Judges 1:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1574/bible_king-james-version_judges_1_2" target=_top>2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1574/bible_king-james-version_judges_1_3" target=_top>3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1574/bible_king-james-version_judges_1_4" target=_top>4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1574/bible_king-james-version_judges_1_5" target=_top>5</a>)<br />Judah too represents the Lord's heavenly qualities, while Simeon represents the spiritual qualities in him, which sprang from the heavenly ones. The Canaanite is the evil and the Perizzite is the falsity that he overcame. This was a divine answer, or prophecy, which should be understood in this way. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1574</b></p><p><b>1574.</b>
That "the Canaanite" signifies the hereditary evil from the mother, in the external man, was before shown (n. 1444); but that "the Perizzite" signifies the falsity that is from evil, is evident from 
other passages in the Word where the Perizzite is named. As in the following concerning Jacob: </p>
<p>     Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me, to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the 
land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites; and I am mortals of number [i.e., few], and they will gather themselves together against me and smite me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house (Gen. 
34:30); </p>
<p>where in like manner evil is signified by "the Canaanite," and falsity by "the Perizzite."  [2] In Joshua: </p>
<p>     Joshua said to the sons of Joseph, If thou be much people, get thee up to the 
forest, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzite and of the Rephaim, if Mount Ephraim is too narrow for thee (Josh. 17:15); </p>
<p>where principles of falsity are signified by "the Perizzite," 
and persuasions of falsity by "the Rephaim," which they were to extirpate; for in the spiritual sense "Mount Ephraim" is intelligence.  [3] In the book of Judges: </p>
<p>     After the death of Joshua, 
the sons of Israel also asked of Jehovah, Who shall go up for us first against the Canaanite, to fight against him? And Jehovah said, Judah shall go up; behold I have given the land into his hand. 
And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, and let us fight against the Canaanite; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. And Simeon went with him. And Judah went 
up; and Jehovah gave the Canaanite and the Perizzite into their hand (Judg. 1:1-4); </p>
<p>where by "Judah" likewise is represented the Lord as to celestial things, and by "Simeon" as to the derivative spiritual 
things; "the Canaanite" is evil, and "the Perizzite" falsity, which were overcome. This was the response, or Divine oracle, which, with this explanation, is understood. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1574</b></p><p><b>1574.</b>
That 'the Canaanite' means hereditary evil from the mother in, the external man has been shown already in <a href="1444.htm">1444</a>, but that 'the Perizzite' means falsity deriving from evil is clear from other places in 
the Word where the Perizzite is mentioned, as in the following regarding Jacob, </p>
<blockquote>
Jacob said to Simeon and to Levi, You have brought trouble on me by making me stink among the inhabitants of the land, 
among the Canaanites and the Perizzites; and I being few in number, they will gather themselves together against me and smite me, and I shall be destroyed, I and my house. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2034:30&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 34:30</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here similarly 
'the Canaanite' means evil and 'the Perizzite' falsity.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In Joshua, </p>
<blockquote>
Joshua said to the sons of Joseph, If you are a numerous people, go up to the forest, and cut down for yourself there 
in the land of the Perizzites and the Rephaim, if Mount Ephraim is too narrow for you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%2017:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 17:15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the Perizzites' means false assumptions and 'the Rephaim' false persuasions which they were 
to wipe out, for 'Mount Ephraim' in the internal sense means intelligence. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the Book of Judges, </p>
<blockquote>
After the death of Joshua the children of Israel inquired of Jehovah, saying, Who will go up 
for us against the Canaanite to start and fight against him? And Jehovah said, Judah shall go up; behold, I have given the land into his hand. And Judah said to Simeon his brother, Go up with me into 
my lot, and let us fight against the Canaanite, and I will also go with you into your lot And Simeon went with him, and Judah went up. and Jehovah gave the Canaanite and the Perizzite into their hand. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%201:1-5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 1:1-5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'Judah' also represents the Lord as regards celestial things, and 'Simeon' as regards derivative spiritual things. 'Canaanite' is the evil, and 'Perizzite' the falsity, that were 
overcome. This is how this reply, or Divine oracle, is to be understood. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1574</b>
</p><b>1574.</b>
Quod 'Canaanita' significet malum a matre hereditarium in externo homine, ostensum est prius n. 1444, quod autem 'Perizzita' significet falsum ex malo, constat ex aliis locis in Verbo ubi Perizzita 
nominatur, ut de Jacobo, 	Dixit Jacobus ad Shimeonem et ad Levi, Perturbastis me, fetere faciendo me apud habitatorem terrae; apud Canaanitas, et apud Perizzitas, et ego mortales numeri, et congregabunt 
se supra me, et percutient me; et perdar ego et domus mea, 	Gen. xxxiv 30; </p>
<p>ubi similiter per 'Canaanitam' significatur malum, et per 'Perizzitam' falsum: [2] apud Josuam, 	Dixit ad filios Josephi 
Josua, Si populus multus tu, ascende tibi in silvam, et exscindas tibi ibi in terra Perizzaei, et Rephaim, si angustus tibi mons Ephraim, xvii 15; </p>
<p>ubi per 'Perizzaeos' significantur principia falsi, 
per 'Rephaim' persuasiones falsi, quae exstirparent, nam 'mons Ephraim' in sensu interno est intelligentia.  [3] In Libro Judicum, 	Post mortem Josuae, et interrogaverunt filii Israelis Jehovam, 
dicendo, Quis ascendet nobis ad Canaanitam, in initio ad pugnandum contra eum? et dixit Jehovah, Jehudah ascendet, ecce dedi terram in manum ejus. Et dixit Jehudah Shimeoni fratri suo Ascende mecum in 
sortem meam, et pugnemus contra Canaanitam, et ibo etiam ego tecum in sortem tuam; et ivit cum illo Shimeon, et ascendit Jehudah, et dedit Jehovah Canaanitam et Perizzitam in manum illorum, i 	(x)1-5; </p>
<p>ubi 
per 'Jehudam' quoque repraesentatur Dominus quoad caelestia per 'Shimeonem' quoad spiritualia inde; 'Canaanita' est malum 'Perizzita' est falsum, quod evictum; hoc erat responsum seu oraculum divinum, 
quod ita intelligitur. </p>
