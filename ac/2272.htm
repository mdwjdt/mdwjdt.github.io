<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2272节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2272.</strong>“说，假若在那里找到四十个呢”表那些经历了试探的人。这从数字四十的含义清楚可知，四十是指试探，如第一卷所解释的（<a href="730.htm">730</a>节）。这些事以一个系列相继发生，这从试探可以看出来。试探的发生不仅是为了人可以确认真理，还为了真理能与良善结合得更紧密。因为经历试探时，人会为了真理而与虚假争战，那时，他遭受内心痛苦和折磨，故属于恶欲的生命快乐及其伴随的乐趣不复存在。来自主的良善会流入进来，同时邪恶被视为可憎恶的。其结果是，与之前的思维相反的新思维会产生。然后，其心智能被折向这些思维，从而能从邪恶转向与真理结合的良善。由于良善与真理通过试探结合，并且前一节说到，那些良善能与真理结合之人会得救，故本节才会出现这样的话，大意是，良善与真理能通过试探结合。这就是那些知晓内义的人所看到的一系列观念。</p>

And he said, Peradventure forty shall be found there. That this signifies those who have been in temptation, is evident from the signification of the number forty, as being temptations (explained in 
volume 1, n. 730). How these things follow on in a series may be seen from temptations. Temptations take place to the end not only that the man may be confirmed in truths, but also that truths may be 
more closely conjoined with goods; for man is then battling for truths against falsities, and as he is then in interior distress and in torment, the delights of the life of cupidities and their derivative 
pleasures come to a cessation; and then goods flow in from the Lord, the consequence of which is that evils are at the same time regarded as abominable, and the effect of this is new thoughts of 
a nature contrary to those possessed before, to which the man may afterwards be bent, thus from evils to goods, and these goods be conjoined with truths. And as the conjunction of good with truth is effected 
by means of temptations, and as it has been said in a former verse that those would be saved with whom goods can be conjoined with truths, therefore there follows what is here said; and indeed 
in such words as to signify that goods and truths can be conjoined by means of temptations. This is the connection of the subject matters for those who are in the internal sense. </p>

'And said, Perhaps forty will be found there' means people who have undergone temptations. This is clear from the meaning of the number 'forty' as temptations, dealt with in Volume One, in <a href="730.htm">730</a>. How these 
details follow on in the train of thought is seen from what temptations are. Temptations arise not only so that a person may be confirmed in truths but also so that truths may be joined more closely 
to goods; for in times of temptation he fights for truths against falsities. And because during temptations he suffers inward distress and suffers torment, the delights of life belonging to evil desires 
and their attendant pleasures cease to exist. Goods from the Lord flow in, and at the same time evils are regarded as abominable. As a consequence of this new thoughts contrary to those that he 
had previously now arise. Towards these his mind is then able to be turned, and so it is able to be turned from evils to goods, which are then joined to truths. And because it is through temptations 
that good becomes joined to truth, and because in the previous verse it was said that those would be saved with whom goods are able to be joined to truths, what occurs in this verse to the effect that 
goods and truths are able to be joined through temptations therefore follows. This is the sequence of ideas seen by those who know the internal sense. </p>

`Et dixit, Forte inventi fuerint ibi quadraginta': quod significet qui in tentationibus fuerunt, constat a significatione numeri `quadraginta' quod sint tentationes, de qua in Parte Prima n. 730.  Quomodo 
haec in serie sequuntur, constare potest a tentationibus; tentationes existunt ob finem, non solum ut confirmetur homo in veris, sed etiam ut vera bonis arctius conjungantur, pugnat enim tunc pro 
veris contra falsa; et quia tunc in interiore dolore est, et in cruciatu, jucunda vitae cupiditatum et inde voluptatum cessant, et tunc influunt bona a Domino, et tunc simul mala spectantur ut abominabilia, 
inde novae et prioribus contrariae cogitationes, ad quas postea flecti potest, (o)et sic a malis ad bona, et haec conjungi veris; et quia per tentationes conjunctio boni cum vero fit, et in 
priore versu dictum est quod salvarentur ii apud quos bona conjungi possunt veris, ideo hoc sequitur, et quidem ita quod conjungi possint per tentationes; hic nexus rerum est illis qui in sensu interno sunt. </p>
