<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5454节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5454.</strong>“若不真，我指着法老的性命起誓，你们一定是奸细”表否则，可以确定你们只是为了利益而拥有真理。这从“法老的性命”和“奸细”的含义清楚可知：“法老的性命”是指一种确定性（参看<a href="5449.htm">5449</a>节）；“奸细”是指那些唯独为了物质利益而对教会真理感兴趣的人（<a href="5432.htm">5432</a>，<a href="5438.htm">5438</a>，<a href="5447.htm">5447</a>节）。我们之所以不再进一步解释这些和此前的话，是因为它们已经以一种总体的方式被解释了；而且它们都是诸如无法清晰、明白地进入理解力的那类事。因为总体概念必须先存在于理解力中，然后才能添加诸如包含在之前那些话中的那类具体细节。若不先接受总体概念，具体细节绝不会被允许进入。事实上，它们会使人厌倦，或说是厌烦的源头，因为对这类细节的情感不会存在，除非在此之前总体概念带着情感进入。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5454</b></p><p><b>5454.</b>
Or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies. That this signifies that otherwise it is certain that you have truths only for the sake of gain, is evident from the signification of "by the life 
of Pharaoh," as being of a certainty (see n. 5449); and from the signification of "spies," as being they who are in the truths of the church only to seek gain (n. 5432, 5438, 5447). A further explication 
of these and the immediately preceding words is omitted, because they have been unfolded already in a general way, and moreover they are such as cannot fall distinctly into the understanding; for 
general things must first be in the understanding, and then particular things may come in under them, such as are contained in the preceding words. If the generals have not been first received, the particulars 
are not admitted, and even excite disgust; for there can be no affection for particulars, unless generals have previously entered with affection. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5454</b></p><p><b>5454.</b>
'And if not, as sure as Pharaoh lives, you are spies' means that otherwise it is a certainty that truths exist with you solely for the sake of gain. This is clear from the meaning of 'as sure as Pharaoh 
lives' as a certainty, dealt with in <a href="5449.htm">5449</a>, and from the meaning of 'spies' as ones who are interested in the truths known to the Church solely for the sake of material gain, dealt with in <a href="5432.htm">5432</a>, <a href="5438.htm">5438</a>, <a href="5447.htm">5447</a>. No fuller explanation of these words and those immediately before them is attempted here as a general explanation has appeared already in what went before, apart from which they are the kinds 
of matters that cannot possibly present themselves at all clearly to the understanding. For general ideas must exist first in the understanding, and only then can the particular details such as are 
contained in what went previously be added. If general ideas are not received first, particular details are by no means allowed in. Indeed they are a source of boredom since no affection for such details 
exists unless the general ideas have entered in with affection prior to that. </p>

`Et si non, vivat Pharaoh, quod exploratores vos': quod significet alias certum quod vera, vobis solum lucri causa, constat ex significatione `vivat Pharaoh' quod sit certum, de qua n. (x)5449; et ex 
significatione `exploratorum' quod sint in Ecclesiae veris solum ad captandum lucrum, de qua n. 5432, 5438, (x)5447. Haec et quae proxime praecedunt ulterius {1}explicari supersedentur, quia in antecedentibus 
in communi explicata sunt, et praeterea sunt talia quae non distincte in intellectum cadere possunt; communia enim prius in intellectu erunt, et tunc primum subintrant particularia qualia continentur 
in {2}his antecedentibus; communia si non recepta fuerint prius, particularia nequaquam admittuntur, immo faciunt taedium, nam nulla affectio particularium datur nisi prius communia intrarunt 
cum affectione. @1 explicare supersedetur$   @2 mox$ </p>
