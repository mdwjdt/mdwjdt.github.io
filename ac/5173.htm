<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5173节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5173.</strong>来世有很多搅动的方法，以及很多引入螺旋运动的方法。这种搅动在身体中就表现为血液、血清或淋巴，以及乳糜的提纯或净化，这也是通过各种提炼过程来实现的；而引入螺旋运动则表现为随后将这些提炼出来的流体引入功用。灵人被搅动后就被带入宁静和快乐的状态，然后被带入他们将被引入并加入的社群，这种事在来世很常见。血液、血清和乳糜，以及胃中食物的提炼和净化过程就对应于灵界中的这类过程；这一观念在那些以为属世事物里面除了属世的东西外什么也没有的人看来显得很奇怪，在那些坚信这一点，因而否认属世事物里面有或可能有任何起作用并主导的属灵事物之人看来甚至显得更奇怪。而事实上，自然界及其三个王国中的每一个事物都有一个来自灵界的内在作用力；若非如此，自然界中的任何事物都无法充当原因和结果，因而无物被产生。在属世事物里面来自灵界的东西被描述为自创世时就被植入的一种力量；而真相是，它只是一种努力；当这种努力停止时，行为或动作也就停止了。这一切表明，整个可见世界就是代表灵界的一个舞台。<br />其中的情形就像肌肉运动和随之产生的动作。除非肌肉运动含有源于人的思维和意愿的一种努力在自己里面，否则它会立刻停止；因为学术界众所周知的法则表明，当努力停止时，动作也就停止了；心智的整个决定就存在于努力里面；动作里面除了努力外，没有任何真实事物。显然，行为或动作里面的这种力量或努力是属世事物里面的属灵事物；因为思维和意愿是属灵的，而行为和动作是属世的。那些思维没有超越自然界的人根本不理解这一点；然而，他们却无法否认它。不过，存在于意愿中，并由此存在于思维中的东西却是那产生行者；虽然它在形式上与它所产生的行为不同。因为行为只是代表心智所意愿并思考的东西。</p>

In the other life there are very many methods of agitation, and also very many methods of inaugurations into circles. The purifying in the body of the blood, as well as of the serum or lymph, and also 
of the chyle, represents these agitations, which are effected also by various castigations; and the subsequent introducing into use of these fluids represents the inaugurations into circles. It is a 
very common thing in the other life for spirits, after undergoing agitation, to be let into a tranquil and delightful state, thus into the societies into which they are to be inaugurated, and to which 
they are to be joined.  [2] That the castigation and purifying of the blood, serum, and chyle, and of the food in the stomach, correspond to such things in the spiritual world, cannot but seem strange 
to those who think of nothing else in natural things than what is natural, and especially to those who believe in nothing else, thus denying that there is or can be anything spiritual within natural 
things that acts and rules; when yet the truth is that in all and each of the things in nature and her three kingdoms there is an inward active force from the spiritual world; and unless this were 
so, nothing whatever in the natural world could act as cause and effect, and consequently nothing could be produced. That which is within natural things from the spiritual world is called a force implanted 
from the first creation; whereas it is an endeavor, on the cessation of which, action or motion ceases. Hence it is that the universal visible world is a theater representative of the spiritual 
world. [3] The case herein is like that of the motion of the muscles from which is action; unless there were in this motion an endeavor from man's thought and will it would cease in a moment; for it 
is according to laws known in the learned world that when endeavor ceases, motion ceases, and also that everything of determination is in endeavor, and that in motion there is nothing real except endeavor. 
It is clear that this force or endeavor in action or motion is the spiritual in the natural; for to think and will is spiritual, and to act and be moved is natural. It is true that those who do 
not think beyond nature do not apprehend this, and yet they cannot deny it. Nevertheless that in the will and thence in the thought, which produces, is not alike in form to the action that is produced; 
for the action merely represents that which the mind wills and thinks. </p>

In the next life very many ways of harrying people are employed, and also very many methods that involve introducing them into a kind of spiralling. Harryings are represented in the body by the purifications 
of the blood, also the serum or lymph as well as the chyle, which too are accomplished by various refining processes, while introductions into spiralling are represented by the subsequent assignment 
of those refined fluids to particular services. It is very common in the next life for spirits to be brought, after they have been harried, into a state of tranquillity and delight, and then to 
be brought to those communities which they are to be introduced into and become attached to. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The idea that the refining processes and purifications of the blood, serum, and chyle, and also of 
the food in the stomach, correspond to such processes in the spiritual world is bound to seem strange to those who presume that natural things hold no more than what is natural within them, and even 
stranger to those who are quite convinced that this is so and accordingly deny that anything spiritual, active or reactive, does or can lie within natural things. Yet the reality is that every single 
thing in the natural world and its three kingdoms possesses something acting into it from the spiritual world. If this were not so, nothing whatever in the natural world could accomplish any cause and 
effect, and therefore nothing would be brought forth. That which natural things hold within them from the spiritual world is described as a force implanted since creation began; but in fact it is an 
endeavour, and when that endeavour ceases, action or motion ceases. All this demonstrates that the whole visible world is a theatre representative of the spiritual world. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The case is the same with 
the movement of the muscles and consequent action. Unless the movement of them held within it an endeavour originating in the person's thought and will, it would instantly cease; for laws well known 
to the learned world state that when the endeavour ceases so does the movement, and also that the person's entire direction of mind is present within the endeavour, as well as that nothing real other 
than the endeavour expresses itself within the movement. The force or endeavour within the action or movement is, it is plain, something spiritual within something natural; for thought and will are 
spiritual activities, whereas action and movement are natural ones. People whose thought does not extend beyond the natural world have no grasp of this at all; yet they are not able to deny it. Nevertheless 
what exists in the will, and from there in the thought, is the producer of the action, though it is not similar in form to the action which it produces. For the action merely represents what the 
mind wills and thinks. </p>

Sunt in altera vita perplures modi vexationum, et quoque perplures modi inaugurationum in gyros; vexationes illas repraesentant sanguinis, tum seri {1}aut lymphae, ut et chyli purificationes in corpore, 
quae quoque fiunt per varias castigationes; et inaugurationes illas in gyros repraesentant introductiones illorum fluidorum postea ad usus communissimum est in altera vita quod postquam vexati 
sunt spiritus, dein in statum tranquillum et jucundum mittantur, proinde in societates, quibus inaugurandi et adjungendi. Quod 2 castigationes et purificationes sanguinis, seri et chyli, tum quoque 
alimentorum in ventriculo, correspondeant talibus in spirituali mundo, non potest non apparere sicut alienum illis qui nihil aliud quam naturale in naturalibus cogitant, et magis qui id credunt, 
sic negantes quod aliquid spirituale insit vel inesse possit quod agit et regit; cum tamen ita se res habet, quod in omnibus et singulis quae in natura et tribus ejus regnis sunt, intrinsecus sit 
agens ex spirituali mundo; </p>
<p>tale nisi inde inesset, nihil prorsus in naturali mundo ageret {3} causam et effectum; proinde nec aliquid produceret; id quod e spirituali mundo in naturalibus inest, 
vocatur vis insita a prima creatione, at est conatus, quo cessante cessat actio seu motus; </p>
<p>inde est quod universus mundus aspectabilis sit theatrum repraesentativum mundi spiritualis. Similiter se 
(t)habet hoc sicuti 3 motu musculorum unde actio; nisi ei insit conatus ex cogitatione et voluntate hominis, momento cessaret, (m)nam secundum regulas in orbe erudito notas est quod cessante conatu 
cesset motus, tum quod in conatu sit omne determinationis, ut et quod in motu nihil reale existat quam conatus(n); quod {3}vis illa seu conatus ille in actione seu motu spirituale sit in naturali, liquet, 
nam cogitare et velle est spirituale, at agere et moveri est naturale; qui non ultra naturam cogitant, hoc ne quidem capiunt, sed usque non negare possunt; ast id quod in voluntate et inde 
in cogitatione est quod producit, non est simile in forma cum actione quae producitur, actio enim solum repraesentat id quod mens vult et cogitat. @1 seu$ @2 i aliquam$ @3 A had quod conatus ille, 
but alters to quod vis et conatus ille$ </p>
