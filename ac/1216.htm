<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1216节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>1216．“各随他们的宗族”就是各随他们的习惯风俗；“各随他们的口音”就是各随他们的信念；“各随他们的陆地”是指总体上的这类信念；“各随他们的民族”是指总体上的这类习惯风俗。这从圣言中各个词，即宗族、口音、陆地和民族的含义清楚看出来，对此，参看前文（10:5）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1216.</strong> By their clans means according to their standards of behavior; by their tongues means according to their way of thinking; in their lands means in respect generally to their way of thinking; and in their nations means in respect generally to their behavioral standards. This is established by the symbolism of each — clan, tongue, land, and nation — in the Word. For those meanings, see what was said above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1216/bible_king-james-version_genesis_10_5" target=_top>5</a>.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} See <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1216/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1159" target=_top>1159</a>, where the symbolism of "clans," "tongues," and "nations" but not of "land" is given. Perhaps the symbolism of "land" is to be understood by inference from the other meanings given in that section. On the meaning of the term "land" with particular respect to "earth" and "ground," see note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1216/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566" target=_top>566</a>.

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1216</b></p><p><b>1216.</b>
That "according to their families" is according to their morals; that "according to their tongues" is according to their opinions; that "in their lands" is in general relatively to their opinions; and 
that "in their nations" is in general relatively to their morals, can be seen from the signification of each term in the Word-that is, of "family," "tongue," "land," and "nation"-concerning which see 
what was said above, at verse 5. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1216</b></p><p><b>1216.</b>
'According to their families' means according to their habits and customs, 'according to their tongues' means according to their individual beliefs, 'in their lands' means in general as regards such 
beliefs, and 'in their nations' in general as regards such habits and customs. This becomes clear from the meaning in the Word of each of these, namely family, tongue, land, and nation, for which see 
what has been stated above at verse 5. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1216</b>
</p><b>1216.</b>
Quod 'secundum familias' sit secundum mores, 'secundum linguas' quod sit secundum opiniones, 'in terris' quod sit in communi respective ad opiniones, et 'in gentibus' quod sit in communi respective 
ad mores, constare potest a significatione cujusvis, nempe familiae, linguae, terrae, gentis, in Verbo, de quibus videantur quae dicta supra ad vers. 5. </p>
