<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3090.</strong>“她说，我主请喝”表肯定答复。这从应允或同意清楚可知。从婚姻明显可知，当真理要与良善联结时，何为对它的肯定答复，因为婚姻的基础就是双方所给出的同意。这源于良善与真理的婚姻：良善那一方有意愿，真理那一方有同意，这二者由此联结起来。虽然在人正经历重生，即正进入天上婚姻期间，良善与真理的这种婚姻在他里面并不可见，但它的确发生了。这从以下事实非常清楚地看出来：当人正经历重生时，一种婚姻必发生在意愿和理解力之间；良善在意愿那一方，真理在理解力那一方。由于这个原因，古人在意愿和理解力，以及意愿的个体部分和理解力的个体部分之间建立了婚姻（<a href="54.htm">54</a>，<a href="55.htm">55</a>节）。</p>

And she said, Drink, my lord. That this signifies reciprocation, is evident from the assent or consent. What the reciprocation of truth is when it is to be conjoined with good, is apparent from marriages; 
for marriage comes from the fact that there is consent on both sides. This has its origin from the marriage of good and truth; on the side of good there is will, and on that of truth there is consent, 
and from this comes the conjunction. Although this reciprocation is not apparent with man when he is being regenerated, that is, when he is entering into the heavenly marriage, it nevertheless 
takes place. The same is more manifest from the fact that when a man is being regenerated, there is effected a likeness of a marriage between the will and the understanding; good being of the will, and 
truth of the understanding. Therefore the ancients instituted a marriage between the will and the understanding, and between the several things of the will and those of the understanding (n. 54, 55). </p>

'And she said, Drink, my lord' means an affirmative response. This is clear from the agreement or consent. What the affirmative response by truth is when it is to be joined to good is evident from marriages, 
for the basis of any marriage is the consent given by both parties. This has its origin in the marriage of good and truth, in that one party - good - proposes and the other - truth - consents, 
and the two are thereby joined together. Although this marrying of good and truth is not seen in a person while he is being regenerated, that is, while he is entering into the heavenly marriage, it 
is nevertheless taking place. This is quite evident from the consideration that while a person is being regenerated a kind of marriage must take place between the will and the understanding, good being 
on the side of the will, truth on that of the understanding. For this reason the ancients established a marriage between will and understanding, and between the individual parts of the will and the 
understanding, <a href="54.htm">54</a>, <a href="55.htm">55</a>. </p>

</p><b>3090.</b>
`Et dixit, Bibe domine mi': quod significet reciprocum, constat ex annuentia seu consensu: quid reciprocum veri cum conjungendum bono, apparet a conjugiis; inde enim conjugium, quod consensus sit ab 
utraque parte; hoc ducit originem a conjugio boni et veri; est voluntas a parte boni, et consensus a parte veri, inde conjunctio; hoc tametsi non apparet apud hominem cum regeneratur, hoc est, cum intrat 
in conjugium caeleste, usque tamen existit; hoc manifestius patet inde quod dum regeneratur homo, instar conjugii fiet inter voluntatem et intellectum; voluntatis est bonum, intellectus est verum; 
ideo antiqui inter voluntatem et intellectum, ac inter singula quae voluntatis et intellectus sunt, instituerunt conjugium, n. 54, 55. </p>
