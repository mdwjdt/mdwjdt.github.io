<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7622节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7622.</strong>这一切结束后，我周围全神贯注地注视这鸟及其一系列变化的灵人们开始彼此谈论它，并且谈了很长时间。他们觉得这种景象必表示某种天上的事物。他们知道，火焰表示属天之爱及其情感；它贴在上面的手表示生命及其能力；颜色的变化表示在智慧和聪明方面的生命变化。他们知道，这鸟具有同样的含义，不同之处在于：火焰表示属天之爱和这爱的方方面面；而鸟表示属灵之爱和这爱的方方面面；属天之爱就是对主之爱，属灵之爱是相爱和对邻之仁。他们也知道，这鸟在颜色，同时在生命上的变化，直到变得像石头，表示属灵生命在聪明方面的连续变化。他们还知道，从下面上来，通过腰部到了胸部的灵人完全确信：他们在主里面，由此确信他们所行的一切，即便是恶毒的犯罪行为，也都是照主的旨意而行的。然而，他们无法由此知道这种景象指的是谁。最终他们从天上获知，原来指的是火星居民；贴在手上的火焰表示他们的属天之爱，这爱仍存在于他们当中的许多人里面；颜色的一系列变化表示他们的智慧和聪明；起初，也就是当颜色美丽，充满生命之时的鸟，表示他们的属灵之爱；但变得像石头、缺乏生气，然后变成黑色的鸟，表示那些远离爱之良善，陷入邪恶，然而仍相信他们在主里面的居民。关于这些居民的性质及其生命状态，还有更多的事已向我披露并展示，我将在下一章末尾讲述它们。</p>

When this had passed, the spirits who were about me who had gazed intently upon the bird and its successive changes, began to converse together about it, and this for a long time. They perceived that 
such a sight must signify something heavenly. They knew that a flame signifies celestial love and its affections; that a hand, to which the flame adhered, signifies life and its power; that changes of 
color signify varieties of life in respect to wisdom and intelligence; that a bird signifies the same, but with this difference, that a flame signifies celestial love and what is of this love, whereas 
a bird signifies spiritual love and what is of this love; celestial love is love to the Lord, and spiritual love is mutual love and charity toward the neighbor; and the changes of color and likewise 
of life in the bird until it became stone, signify successive varieties of spiritual life in respect to intelligence. They also knew that the spirits who ascend from beneath through the region of the 
loins to that of the breast, are in a strong persuasion that they are in the Lord, and thence believe that all that they do, even though evil and wicked, is done according to the Lord's will. Nevertheless 
they could not from this know who were meant by this sight. At last they were instructed from heaven that the inhabitants of Mars were meant; that their celestial love, in which many of them still 
are, was signified by the flame which adhered to the hand; and their wisdom and intelligence by the successive variations of color; and that the bird in the beginning, when it was in the beauty of 
its colors and the vigor of its life, signified their spiritual love; but that the bird becoming as of stone and void of life, and then of a dark color, signified the inhabitants who had removed themselves 
from the good of love, and are in evil, and yet believe that they are in the Lord. But as more things have been disclosed and also shown as to those inhabitants who are of this quality, and as 
to the state of their life, I may relate them at the end of the following chapter. </p>

When all this had been completed the spirits around me who had watched the bird intently and the series of changes it had undergone talked to one another about it, and for a considerable length of time. 
They perceived that this kind of sight could only be a sign of something heavenly. They knew that the flaming object was a sign of heavenly love and affections; that the hand which the flame clung 
to was a sign of life and the power of life, and the changes of colour signs of variations in wisdom and intelligence that go with that life. They knew that the bird too had a similar meaning, the difference 
being that the flaming object was a sign of celestial love and aspects of that love, while the bird was a sign of spiritual love and aspects of this love. (Celestial love is love to the Lord, 
spiritual love is mutual love and charity towards the neighbour.) They knew too that the changes in the colours of the bird, and at the same time in the life it had within it until it became stone-like, 
were signs of the various successive changes in the intelligence that goes with that spiritual life. </p>

 They knew furthermore that spirits who come up from underneath by way of the region of the 
loins into that of the breast are utterly convinced that the Lord is with them, and as a consequence believe that in all they do, even wicked and criminal acts, they are doing the Lord's will. Yet 
although the spirits around me knew all these things they could not figure out who exactly were meant in the scene they had witnessed. Eventually they learned from heaven that the inhabitants of Mars 
were meant; that their celestial love, which still exists in a large number of them, was meant by the flame that clung to the hand; that their wisdom and intelligence was meant by the series of varying 
colours; and that the bird at first, when its colours were beautiful and it was full of life, meant their spiritual love, but then, when that bird became stone-like, lacking in life, and dull-coloured, 
it meant inhabitants who had forsaken the good of love for evil, yet still believed that the Lord was with them. But since there is more that has been disclosed and demonstrated to me about those 
inhabitants who are like this and about their state of life, let that be recorded at the end of the next chapter. </p>

Cum hoc peractum est, spiritus qui circum me, qui avem illam et successivas ejus mutationes intense sunt intuiti, de illa inter se loquebantur, et hoc per insigne tempus; percipiebant quod tale visum 
non potuerit aliter quam caeleste quoddam significare; sciebant quod flammeum significet amorem caelestem et ejus affectiones: quod manus cui flammeum adhaerebat, vitam et ejus potentiam: colorum mutationes 
vitae varietates quoad sapientiam et intelligentiam; simile etiam (s)avis, cum differentia quod flammeum significet amorem caelestem et quae illius amoris sunt, et quod avis significet amorem 
spiritualem et quae illius amoris sunt; {1}(amor caelestis est amor in Dominum, et amor spiritualis est amor mutuus (c)et charitas erga proximum;) et quod mutationes colorum {2}et simul vitae in ave, 
usque dum facta {3} lapidea, significet varietates successivas vitae spiritualis quoad intelligentiam. (s) 	2 Sciebant etiam quod spiritus qui ex interiore per regionem lumborum ad regionem pectoris 
ascendunt in forti persuasivo sint quod in Domino sint, ac inde credant quod omnia quae faciunt, etiam mala ac scelesta, volente Domino faciant.  Sed tamen non inde scire potuerunt quinam per visum hoc 
intelligerentur; tandem instructi sunt e caelo quod incolae Martis intellecti sint; quod caelestis illorum amor, in quo adhuc plures sunt, significatus sit per flammeum quod adhaesit manui; et quod 
sapientia et intelligentia illorum per colorum successivas variationes; et quod avis in principio, cum in (x)pulchritudine colorum suorum ac in vigore vitae suae esset, significaret amorem illorum spiritualem; 
quod autem avis illa tacta sit sicut lapidea ac nullius vitae, et tunc coloris obscuri, quod id significaret incolas qui a bono amoris se removerunt ac in malo sunt, et tamen credunt quod sint 
in Domino.  Sed quia de incolis illis qui tales sunt, et de statu vitae illorum, plura detecta et quoque ostensa sunt, licet illa ad finem capitis sequentis referre. 	@1 A has no brackets$ 	@2 in
