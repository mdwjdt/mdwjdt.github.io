<p><strong>[NCE]1484.</strong>a{*1} The fact that the woman was taken to Pharaoh's house means that they would capture his fancy can be seen from the symbolism of a woman and of a house. A woman symbolizes truth 钬?here, the truth contained in scholarly learning, whose pleasures captivated the Lord in his youth. The pleasures of truth are those that come from truth intuitively known (symbolized by a sister). A house symbolizes qualities in us, especially qualities of our will, as shown earlier, in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1484/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_710" target=_top>710</a>. So here it symbolizes what we fancy, or what we love to know and learn.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} (in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1484/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1484" target=_top>1484</a>a). Both this paragraph and the next are numbered 1484 in the first Latin edition. [LHC]<br />1484.b <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1484/bible_king-james-version_genesis_12_16" target=_top>Genesis 12:16</a>. And he was good to Abram on her account, and Abram had flock and herd, and male donkeys and male servants, and female servants and female donkeys, and camels.<br />He was good to Abram on her account means that the number of facts the Lord knew multiplied. And Abram had flock and herd, and male donkeys and male servants, and female servants and female donkeys, and camels, symbolizes all the general categories of fact. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1484</b></p><p><b>1484.</b>
And the woman was taken to Pharaoh's house. That this signifies that they captivated the lower mind, is evident from the signification of "woman," and from the signification of "house." A "woman" signifies 
truth, here the truth that was in the memory-knowledges with the delights of which the Lord was captivated in childhood. The delights of truth are those which come from the intellectual truth which 
is signified by a "sister." A "house" signifies the things that are in man, especially those which are of his will, as before shown (n. 710); here therefore those which are of the lower mind, or 
of the affection of knowing and learning. 1484a. Verse 16. And he did well unto Abram for her sake; and he had flock and herd, and he-asses and menservants, and maidservants and she-asses, and camels. 
"He did well unto Abram for her sake," signifies that memory-knowledges were multiplied with the Lord; "and he had flock and herd, and he-asses and menservants, and maidservants and she-asses, and camels," 
signifies all the things in general that belong to memory-knowledges. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1484</b></p><p><b>1484.</b>
That 'the woman was taken to Pharaoh's house' means that they sought to capture the mind (animus) becomes clear from the meaning of 'woman' and from the meaning of 'house'. 'Woman' means truth, here 
the truth present in types of knowledge, the delights of which captivated the Lord in childhood. The delights of truth are those coming from intellectual truth meant by 'a sister'. 'House' means the things 
that reside in man, in particular those which belong to his will, as shown already in <a href="710.htm">710</a>, here therefore those which belong to the mind (animus), or the affection for knowing and learning. </p>
<p><a href="1484.htm">1484</a>[a] 
Verse 16 And he treated Abram well for her sake; and he had flocks and herds, and asses and menservants, and maidservants and she-asses, and camels. </p>
<p>'He treated Abram well for her sake' means 
that the facts residing with the Lord were multiplied. 'And he had flocks and herds, and asses and menservants, and maidservants and she-asses, and camels' means all things in general which constitute 
factual knowledge. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1484</b>
</p><b>1484.</b>
Quod 'assumpta femina domum Pharaonis' significet quod aucuparent animum, constare potest a significatione 'feminae' et a significatione 'domus'; 'femina' significat verum, hic verum quod scientiis, 
cujus deliciis captus Dominus in pueritia; deliciae veri sunt illae quae ab intellectuali vero quod significatum est per 'sororem,' veniunt; 'domus' significat illa quae apud hominem, imprimis quae ejus 
voluntatis sunt, ut ostensum prius n. 710; hic ideo quae animi, seu affectionis sciendi et discendi. </p>
<p>1484[a].  Vers. 16.  Et Abramo benefecit propter illam; et fuit illi grex et armentum, et asini 
et servi, et ancillae et asinae, et cameli. 'Abramo benefecit propter illam' significat quod scientifica apud Dominum multiplicata sint: 'et fuit illi grex et armentum, et asini et servi, et ancillae 
et asinae, et cameli' significat omnia in genere quae sunt scientificorum. </p>
