Verses 41-45. And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him; and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father draw near, and I will kill Jacob my brother. 
And the words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah; and she sent and called unto Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold Esau thy brother comforteth himself concerning thee to kill thee. 
And now my son hearken unto my voice, and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran. And tarry with him some days until thy brother's wrath turn away, until thy brother's anger turn away from 
thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him, and I will send and take thee from thence; why should I be bereaved even of you both in one day? "And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith 
his father blessed him," signifies that natural good was averse to the inverted conjunction of truth; "and Esau said in his heart," signifies thought; "the days of mourning for my father draw near, 
and I will kill Jacob my brother," signifies the inversion and privation of the self-derived life of truth; "and the words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah," signifies the Lord's perception 
from Divine truth concerning the animus or purpose of natural good at that time; "and she sent and called unto Jacob her younger son, and said unto him," signifies the state of observation of the 
affection of truth from influx through Divine truth; "behold Esau thy brother comforteth himself concerning thee to kill thee," signifies the purpose to invert the state and deprive truth of self-derived 
life; "and now my son hearken unto my voice, and arise," signifies delay as yet; "flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran," signifies to the affection of external or corporeal good; "and tarry with 
him some days," signifies what is successive; "until thy brother's wrath turn away," signifies until the state turns thereto; "until thy brother's anger turn away from thee," signifies what is successive 
of the state with natural good; "and he forget that which thou hast done to him" signifies habit acquired from the delay; "and I will send and take thee from thence," signifies then the end; "why 
should I be bereaved even of you both in one day," signifies that otherwise there would be no conjunction. </p>

Verses 41-45 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him; and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are approaching, and I will kill Jacob 
my brother. And the words of Esau her elder son were pointed out to Rebekah, and she sent and summoned Jacob her younger son, and said to him, Behold, Esau your brother is consoling himself concerning 
you [by planning] to kill you. And now, my son, hearken to my voice, and arise, flee to Laban my brother, to Haran. And stay with him for a few days until your brother's wrath turns back, until your 
brother's anger turns back from you, and he forgets what you have done to him, and I send and fetch you from there. Why should I be bereft of you both in one day? </p>
<p>'Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing 
with which his father had blessed him' means that natural good found the conjunction with truth - inverted as regards order - repugnant. 'And Esau said in his heart' means thought. 'The days of 
mourning for my father are approaching, and I will kill Jacob my brother' means an inversion, and the removal from truth of the life from itself. 'And the words of Esau her elder son were pointed out 
to Rebekah' means the Lord's perception coming from Divine Truth concerning the inclination of natural good at that time. 'And she sent and summoned Jacob her younger son, and said to him' means a state 
in which the affection for truth discerned from an influx coming by way of Divine truth.... 'Behold, Esau your brother is consoling himself concerning you [by planning] to kill you' means, the intention 
to invert the state and to remove from truth the life from itself. 'And now, my son, hearken to my voice, and arise' means a continuance. 'Flee to Laban my brother, to Haran' means in the direction 
of the affection for external or bodily good. 'And stay with him for a few days' means in that which was subsequent. 'Until your brother's wrath turns back' means until the state changes. 'Until 
your brother's anger turns back from you' means the subsequent stage of the state with natural good. 'And he forgets what you have done to him' means the condition that resulted from the delay. 'And 
I send and fetch you from there' means that at that point the end in view has been reached. 'Why should I be bereft of you both in one day?' means that otherwise there would be no conjunction. </p>

Vers. 41-45.  Et odit Esau Jacobum propter benedictionem,  qua benedixit illi pater illius; et dixit Esau in corde suo, Appropinquabunt dies luctus patris mei, et occidam Jacobum fratrem meum. Et indicatum 
Rebeccae verba Esavi filii sui majoris, et misit, et vocavit ad Jacobum filium suum minorem, et dixit ad illum, Ecce Esau frater tuus consolans se tibi ad occidendum te. Et nunc fili mi, ausculta 
voci meae, et surge, fuge tibi ad Laban fratrem meum Haranem. Et commoreris cum eo diebus aliquibus, donec recedit excandescentia fratris tui. Usque recedat ira fratris tui a te, et obliviscatur ejus 
quod fecisti illi, et mittam et accipiam te exinde; quare orbabor etiam ambobus vobis die uno? `Odit Esai Jacobum propter benedictionem, qua benedixit illi pater illius' significat quod bonum naturale 
aversaretur conjunctionem veri inversam: `et dixit Esau in corde suo' significat cogitationem: `Appropinquabunt dies luctus patris mei, et occidam Jacobum fratrem meum' significat inversionem et 
privationem vitae veri a se: `et indicatum Rebeccae verba Esavi filii sui majoris' significat perceptionem Domini ex Divino Vero de animo boni naturalis tunc: `et misit, et vocavit ad Jacobum filium suum 
minorem, et dixit ad illum' significat statum apperceptionis affectionis veri ex influxu per Verum Divinum: `Ecce Esau frater tuus consolans se tibi ad occidendum te' significat animum invertendi 
statum et privandi verum vita a se: `et nunc fili mi, ausculta voci meae, et surge' significat moram adhuc: `fuge tibi ad Laban fratrem meum Haranem' significat ad affectionem boni externi seu corporei: 
`et commoreris cum eo diebus aliquibus' significat successivum: `donec recedit excandescentia fratris tui' significat usque dum status advertit: `usque recedat ira fratris tui a te' significat successivum 
status apud bonum naturale: `et obliviscatur ejus quod fecisti illi' significat habitum ex mora: `et mittam et accipiam te exinde' significat tunc finem: `quare orbabor etiam ambobus vobis die 
uno?' significat quod aliter non conjunctio. </p>
