<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3084节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3084.</strong>“又上来”表提升。 这从“上来”的含义清楚可知，“上来”是指被提升。被提升是指从低层上到高层，并因此也指从外层进入内层，因为这二者是一回事。事实上，人类概念中的低层和高层，就是天使概念中的外层和内层。例如，被世人视为高层的天堂被天使视为内层。人的属世层也一样，相对于他的属灵层，属世层就是外层；而相对于属天层，属灵层就是外层。或也可说，相对于真理，属于属世人的记忆知识就是外层；而相对于良善，真理就是外层。因此，相对于真理，记忆知识被称为遮盖物，以及衣服；同样，相对于良善，真理也被称为遮盖物和衣服。<br />正因如此，经上说“上到”耶路撒冷，从耶路撒冷“下来”；以及从耶路撒冷“上到”锡安，从锡安“下到”耶路撒冷。因为耶路撒冷周围部分表示教会的外层，耶路撒冷表示教会的内层，锡安表示教会的至内层。由于就内义而言，本节描述了真理提升的初始阶段，即真理从属世人被提升进入理性人，故此处经上首先说，由利百加代表的对真理的情感“下到那泉”，然后她“又上来”。因为如前所述（<a href="3074.htm">3074</a>节），圣爱流入对良善的情感，由此流入对真理的情感，在此过程中给属世人中的事物带来生命和光明，同时将它们整理成序。这就是“下来”的含义。真理以这种方式从属世人中被提升进入理性人，并在那里与良善联结。这就是“上来”的含义。</p>

And came up. That this signifies elevation, is evident from the signification of "coming up," as being to be elevated. Being elevated is said of passing from what is lower to what is higher, and also 
therefore of passing from what is exterior to what is interior, which is the same thing; for what is lower or higher in a human idea is exterior or interior in the angelic idea; for instance, heaven, 
which appears to man higher, but to angels interior; and the natural with man-this is exterior relatively to his spiritual; and so again is the spiritual relatively to the celestial; or what is the same, 
memory-knowledge, which is of the natural man, is exterior relatively to truth, and truth is exterior relatively to good; and therefore memory-knowledge relatively to truth is called a veil and also 
clothing, and truth likewise is so called relatively to good; and it is from this that one is said to "go up" to Jerusalem, but to "go down" from Jerusalem; also to "go up from Jerusalem to Zion," 
and to "go down from Zion to Jerusalem;" for by what is round about Jerusalem are signified the exteriors of the church, but by Jerusalem the interiors, and by Zion the inmosts. As in the passage before 
us in the internal sense there is described the first of the elevation of truth out of the natural man to the rational, it is therefore said first that the affection of truth represented by Rebekah 
"went down to the fountain," and then that she "came up;" for, as before said (n. 3074), the Divine love flows into the affection of good, and from this into the affection of truth, and vivifies and 
enlightens the things that are in the natural man, and then disposes them in order (this is signified by "going down"); and by virtue of this, truths are raised out of the natural man into the rational, 
and are conjoined with the good there (this is signified by "going up"). </p>

'And went up' means a raising up. This is clear from the meaning of 'going up' as being raised up. The expression 'raised up' is used to describe from what is lower to what is higher, and because it 
is used to describe this it is also used to describe from what is exterior to what is interior, for the two are one and the same. Indeed what is lower and higher in human thought is exterior and interior 
in angelic thought, as with the idea of heaven. By men heaven is seen as that which is higher, but by angels as that which is interior. It is similarly so with the natural with man. In relation to 
his spiritual it is exterior, while the spiritual in turn is exterior in relation to the celestial. Or what amounts to the same, factual knowledge which belongs to the natural man is exterior in relation 
to truth, while truth is exterior in relation to good. Therefore also factual knowledge in relation to truth is called a covering as well as a garment, and so in a similar way is truth in relation 
to good.  </p>

 This explains why the expressions 'going up' to Jerusalem, but 'coming down' from Jerusalem are used; also 'going up' from Jerusalem to Zion, and 'coming clown' from Zion to Jerusalem; 
for the parts surrounding Jerusalem mean the exterior features of the Church, Jerusalem meaning the more interior features and Zion the inmost. Since in the internal sense this verse describes the 
initial stage in the raising up of truth from the natural man to the rational man, therefore it is first of all said here that the affection for truth represented by Rebekah 'went down to the spring' 
and shortly after that 'went up'. For as stated above in <a href="3074.htm">3074</a>, Divine love flows into the affection for good, and from there into the affection for truth, and in so doing brings life and light to the 
things that are in the natural man, and at the same time orders them. This is the meaning of 'going down'. In this way truths are raised up from the natural man into the rational man where they are joined 
to good. This is the meaning of 'going up'. </p>

`Et ascendit': quod significet elevationem, constat a significatione `ascendere' quod sit elevari: elevari dicitur ab inferiore ad superius, et quia hoc, est {1}ab exteriore ad interius, nam idem est; 
quod enim inferius et superius est in idea humana, hoc exterius et interius est in idea angelica, sicut caelum, hoc apparet homini sicut superius, sed angelis est interius; sicut naturale apud hominem, 
hoc est exterius respective ad ejus spirituale, et hoc iterum exterius respective ad caeleste, seu quod idem, scientificum quod est naturalis hominis est exterius respective ad verum, et verum est 
exterius respective ad bonum, quare etiam scientificum respective ad verum vocatur velamen, tum vestis, et similiter verum respective ad bonum {2}: [2] inde est quod ascendere praedicetur ad Hierosolymam, 
sed descendere a Hierosolyma; tum a Hierosolyma ad Zionem, et a Zione ad Hierosolymam {3}; per illa enim quae sunt circum Hierosolymam significantur exteriora Ecclesiae, per Hierosolymam autem 
interiora, ac per Zionem intima.  Quia hic in sensu interno describitur primum elevationis veri ex naturali homine ad rationalem, ideo hic primum dicitur quod affectio veri, quae repraesentatur per Rebeccam, 
`descenderit ad fontem,' et mox quod `ascenderit'; nam ut supra n. 3074 dictura est, Divinus amor influit in affectionem boni, et inde in affectionem veri, ac vivificat et illustrat illa quae 
in naturali homine, ac tunc disponit illa in ordinem, hoc significatur per `descendere'; {4}ex eo vera elevantur e naturali homine in rationalem, et conjunguntur boni ibi, {5}hoc significatur per `ascendere.' @1
