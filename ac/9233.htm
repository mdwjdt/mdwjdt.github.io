<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9233.</strong>为叫我了解他们的性质，有几个从他们打雷所在的高处下来；令人惊讶的是，一个正背着另一个。二者以这种方式接近我。他们的脸看上去并不难看，只是比其他任何灵人的脸都要长。他们的身高就像七岁的孩子，但身体更为强壮；所以他们是小矮人。天使告诉我，他们来自月球。</p>

That I might know their character, some were sent down from on high where they were thundering, and strange to say, one carried another on his back, and two of them approached me in this attitude. In 
their faces they appeared not unbeautiful, but their faces were longer than those of other spirits. In stature they were like boys of seven years of age, but they had stouter bodies. Thus they were dwarfs. 
I was told by the angels that they were from the Moon. </p>

So that I might know what they were like, some were sent down from the place on high where they boomed thunderously; and what was astonishing, one was carrying the other on his back. In this way the 
two drew near to me. Their faces did not appear to be unattractive, but they were longer than the faces of any other spirits. In height they were like children seven years old, but they had more powerful 
bodies; so they were midgets. I was told by angels that they came from the moon.  </p>

Ut scirem quales essent, {1}demissi sunt quidam ex alto ubi tonabant, et quod mirum, unus portabat alterum a tergo, et sic appropinquabant bini ad me; apparebant facie non invenusta sed longiore quam 
facies reliquorum spirituum; statura simili staturae pueri septem annorum sed corpore robustiore; ita erant homunciones.  Dicebatur mihi ab angelis quod essent e Luna. @1 dimissi IT$ </p>
