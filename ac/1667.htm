<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1667节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1667.</strong>“他们已经事奉基大老玛十二年”表恶与假在童年时并未显露出来，而是顺从表面的良善与真理。这从“基大老玛”的代表物和含义，那些事奉他之人的含义（如1，2节所解释的），以及“十二”的含义清楚可知。基大老玛与前面提到的那些人（1，2节）表示主所具有的表面良善与真理，因而就这些事物而言，表示祂的外在人。“基大老玛”在此表第1节中一起提及的所有人，这从下文，以及他是以拦王的事实明显可知。前面已论述以拦的含义（<a href="1228.htm">1228</a>节），它表示源于仁之信，在此表示真理与良善。因为信与信之物无非是真理，仁与仁之物无非是良善。 <br />不过，它们在此是指童年早期的良善。这类良善尽管看似良善，但只要遗传之恶玷污它们，就不是良善。遗传之物和附着之物来自我欲和物欲。那时，凡属我欲和物欲之物都看似良善，但并非良善。不过，它只要居于尚不知何为纯正良善的婴儿和孩子里面，仍可称作良善。这种无知值得原谅，纯真使它看似良善。但是，当这人接受教导，知道何为善与恶后，情况就不同了。诸如孩子接受教导前所具有的这类良善与真理，用“基大老玛”来表示。 <br />他们“事奉十二年”表这类良善与真理存留的整个时期。因为从内义上说，“十二”表构成属仁之信，即源于仁之信的一切事物，和“以拦”一样（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创10.22.htm">10:22</a>）。只要这种良善与真理在人里面，无论是他童年时还是其它年龄阶段，恶与假就什么也做不成，也就是说，恶灵不敢做什么，或发起恶事。这种情形从婴儿、有教养的孩子和心思简单之人可以看出来。对他们来说，哪怕恶灵，即最坏的魔鬼团伙在场，他们也根本做不了什么，而是处于顺服的状态。这就是此处“他们事奉基大老玛十二年”的含义。<br />那时它们处于顺服状态，并且事奉的原因在于：这个人尚未获得恶欲和虚假的气场。事实上，恶灵和魔鬼可以进入人通过自己的行为所得来的事物进行运作，但不可以进入他由遗传所得来的事物中进行运作。所以，在人获得这类气场之前，恶灵是顺服的；但是，一旦他获得它们，与他同在的恶灵就会涌入，并试图操控。因为那时，他们就在他自己的气场里面，在那里寻找快乐或它们的生命。“尸首在哪里，鹰也必聚在那里”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.28.htm">24:28</a>）。 </p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1667.</strong> For twelve years they served Chedorlaomer means that evil and falsity did not show up in his youth; rather they were subservient to apparent goodness and truth. This is established by the representation and symbolism of Chedorlaomer and of those who served him, discussed above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1667/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_1" target=_top>1</a>. It can also be seen from the symbolism of the number twelve.<br />Chedorlaomer, along with those named above in verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1667/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_1" target=_top>1</a>, symbolizes apparent goodness and truth in the Lord; so he symbolizes the Lord's outer self in regard to apparent goodness and truth. The rest of the chapter makes it clear that Chedorlaomer here stands for all the kings mentioned in verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1667/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_1" target=_top>1</a> as a group. So does the fact that he was the king of Elam, the symbolism of which was dealt with earlier [搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1667/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1228" target=_top>1228</a>], as being the faith that grows out of love for others, or out of charity. It symbolizes both truth and goodness here, then, since faith and all that goes with faith consists entirely of truth, while charity and all that goes with charity consists of goodness.<br />[2] Here, however, it is the goodness of childhood, which may appear good but is not, as long as inherited evil pollutes it. It is the product of a selfishness and materialism that are embedded in and attached to it. Whatever results from self-love and materialism during childhood appears to be good. It is not good, but should still be called good when it appears in children or adolescents who do not yet know what real goodness is. Ignorance excuses them, and innocence makes it seem good. The situation changes, though, when we learn to recognize right and wrong. The kind of goodness and truth that exist in a youth not yet educated is symbolized by Chedorlaomer.<br />[3] The fact that they served twelve years symbolizes the whole period of this type of goodness and truth. On an inner level, twelve symbolizes every aspect of the faith that belongs to charity, or the faith that grows out of charity (just as Elam did at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1667/bible_king-james-version_genesis_10_22" target=_top>Genesis 10:22</a> [搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1667/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1228" target=_top>1228</a>]). As long as this kind of goodness and truth is present in us 钬?whether it is during our youth or at any other stage in our life 钬?evil and falsity can achieve nothing. In other words, evil spirits do not then dare to do anything or to inflict any harm, as is fairly clear from children, well-intentioned young people, and the simple-hearted; even if evil spirits (the worst of the Devil's crew) are present with such a person, they cannot do anything. They are enslaved, which is what is symbolized here by the twelve years that they served Chedorlaomer.<br />[4] The reason they are then enslaved and subservient is that the person has not yet acquired an aura of self-interest and falsity. Evil spirits and demons are not allowed to act on us unless they act on the traits we have chosen for ourselves by the way we live. They are forbidden to act on the traits we have merely inherited. Until we acquire these auras, then, evil spirits serve us. As soon as we do acquire them, on the other hand, evil spirits pour into us and attempt to control us. This is because they are then in their element, and they find a kind of pleasure in it 钬?a pleasure that is the core of their life. Where the carcass is, there are the eagles [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1667/bible_king-james-version_matthew_24_28" target=_top>Matthew 24:28</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1667/bible_king-james-version_luke_17_37" target=_top>Luke 17:37</a>]. </p>

Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer. That this signifies that the evils and falsities did not appear in childhood, but that they served the apparent goods and truths, is evident from the representation 
and signification of "Chedorlaomer," and also of those who served (as explained above, verse 1); and also from the signification of "twelve." "Chedorlaomer," together with those named above (verse 
2), signifies the apparent goods and truths in the Lord, thus His external man in respect to these things. "Chedorlaomer" here denotes all that are named above (verse 2) in the complex, as is evident 
also from what follows, as also from the circumstance that he was king of Elam, the signification of which has been given already, as being faith from charity; here therefore truth and good; for faith 
and the things of faith are nothing but truths, and charity and the things of charity are goods.  [2] But here the goods of infancy, which, although they appear good, are not good so long as hereditary 
evil contaminates them. That which is inherent and which adheres is from the love of self and the love of the world. Whatever is of the love of self and of the love of the world then appears as 
good, but is not good; but still it is to be called good so long as it is in an infant or a child who does not yet know what is truly good. The ignorance excuses, and the innocence makes it appear as 
good. But the case is different when the man has been instructed, and knows what good and evil are. Such good and truth as are in a child before he has been instructed, are signified by "Chedorlaomer." 
 [3] By their "serving twelve years" is signified all the time that there are such good and truth; for in the internal sense "twelve" signifies all things that pertain to the faith of charity, or to 
faith from charity, much the same as "Elam" (Gen. 10:22). And so long as such good and truth are in a man, whether it be in his childhood or at any other age, evils and falsities can effect nothing; 
that is, evil spirits do not venture to do anything, or to introduce any evil; as is evident with infants, well disposed children, and the simple in heart; with whom, even though evil spirits, or the 
worst of the diabolic crew, were present, they could effect nothing at all, but are in subjection; which is here signified by their serving Chedorlaomer twelve years.  [4] The reason of their being 
then in subjection and serving is that the man has not yet acquired to himself a sphere of cupidities and falsities. For evil spirits and genii are not allowed to operate except into those things which 
a man has procured to himself by his acts, and not into those which are from inheritance; and therefore before the man procures such spheres to himself, the evil spirits serve; but as soon as he procures 
them, they pour themselves in upon him, and endeavor to rule; for they are then in his very sphere, and find there a certain delight, or their very life. Where the carcass is, there are the eagles 
[Matt. 24:28]. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1667</b></p><p><b>1667.</b>
That 'twelve years they served Chedorlaomer' means that evils and falsities did not reveal themselves in childhood but were subservient to apparent goods and truths is clear from the representation and 
meaning of Chedorlaomer, and also from the meaning of those who were subservient to him, as explained above at verses 1, 2, and from the meaning of 'twelve' as well. Chedorlaomer together with those 
mentioned above in verse 1 mean apparent goods and truths present with the Lord - thus His External Man as regards those things. Here Chedorlaomer stands for all who are named in verse 1 taken together, 
as is clear in addition from what follows, and also from the fact that he was king of Elam, the meaning of which has been dealt with already, namely faith deriving from charity, and here therefore 
truth and good. For faith and things belonging to faith are nothing but truths, while charity and things belonging to charity are nothing but goods </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Here however they are the goods that belong 
to earliest childhood, which though they appear to be goods are not in fact goods as long as hereditary evil is befouling them, for they have ingrained in them and clinging to them that which derives 
from self-love and love of the world. Whatever belongs to self-love or love of the world appears at the time to be good, but it is not. Nevertheless it must still be called good during the time it resides 
in an infant or child who as yet does not know what is truly good. Their ignorance or lack of knowledge excuses it, and their innocence makes it appear as good. The situation is different however 
when a person has undergone instruction and knows what good and evil are. Such good and truth as exist with a child before instruction is meant by Chedorlaomer. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Their being subservient for twelve 
years means the whole time that such good and truth remain, for in the internal sense 'twelve' means all things constituting the faith that belongs to charity, that is, faith springing from charity, 
as also with Elam in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2010:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 10:22</a>. And as long as such good and truth reside in a person, whether in childhood or in any other period of his life, evils and falsities can achieve nothing, that is, evil 
spirits do not dare to do anything or to initiate anything evil, as is quite evident in the case of infants, well-behaved children, and simple hearted people. With them, even though evil spirits, 
that is, the worst of the devil's crew, were present they could nevertheless achieve absolutely nothing but are held in subjection, which is the meaning here of their being subservient for twelve years 
to Chedorlaomer. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The reason they are kept in subjection during that time and are subservient is that the individual has not yet acquired to himself a sphere of evil desires and of falsities. 
Indeed evil spirits and genii are not allowed to operate except into those things a person has acquired through his own actions, not into those he has by heredity. Consequently before a person acquires 
such spheres to himself, evil spirits are subservient; but as soon as he does acquire them, those evil spirits present with him stream in and try to gain dominion, for they are then situated within 
his own sphere, and there find a certain delight or their very life - 'where the carcass is there will the eagles be gathered together'.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>

Quod 'duodecim annis serviverunt Kedorlaomero' significent quod mala et falsa non apparuerint in pueritia sed quod serviverint bonis et veris apparentibus, constat ex repraesentatione et significatione 
'Kedorlaomeri,' tum ex illorum qui serviverunt, de quibus supra vers. 1, ut et ex significatione 'duodecim.' Kedorlaomer cum illis qui nominantur supra vers. 2, significat bona et vera apparentia 
apud Dominum, ita Externum Hominem quoad illa, hic Kedorlaomer in complexu pro omnibus qui nominantur vers. 2, ut quoque ex sequentibus constat, tum ex eo quod fuerit rex Elami, de cujus significatione 
prius actum est, nempe quod sit fides ex charitate, hic ideo verum et bonum, nam fides et quae fidei, non sunt nisi vera, et charitas et quae charitatis, sunt bona; [2] hic autem bona infantiae, quae 
tametsi bona apparent, non sunt bona quamdiu hereditarium malum illa contaminat; est ex amore sui et ex amore mundi quod inhaeret et adhaeret; quicquid est amoris sui et amoris mundi apparet tunc sicut 
bonum, sed non est bonum, at usque bonum dicendum, quamdiu est apud infantem seu puerum qui adhuc nescit quid vere bonum; ignorantia excusat, et innocentia facit ut sicut bonum appareat; sed aliter 
se res habet cum instructus est homo, et novit quid bonum et malum; tale bonum et verum quale apud puerum antequam instinctus, significatur per 'Kedorlaomerum.'  [3] Quod 'serviverunt duodecim annis' 
significat omne tempus quamdiu tale bonum et verum est, nam 'duodecim' significant in sensu interno omnia quae sunt fidei charitatis, seu fidei ex charitate, similiter ac Elam, Gen. x 22, et quamdiu 
bonum et verum tale est apud hominem, sive sit in ejus pueritia, sive in reliqua ejus aetate, mala et falsa nihil possunt efficere, hoc est, mali spiritus non hiscunt aliquid facere aut inferre aliquod 
malum; sicut satis manifestum est apud infantes, pueros probos, et simplices corde, apud quos tametsi spiritus mali, seu ex turba diabolica pessimi, adforent, usque ne hilum possent efficere sed sunt 
subjugati, quod hic significatur per quod 'duodecim annis serviverint Kedorlaomero'; [4] causa quod tunc subjugati sint et serviant, est quod homo nondum acquisiverit sibi sphaeram cupiditatum et falsitatum; 
non enim operari licet malis spiritibus et geniis nisi in illa quae homo sibi actualiter comparavit, non in illa quae ex hereditario sunt; quare antequam homo comparat sibi tales sphaeras, 
mali spiritus serviunt; sed ut primum comparat, illi apud eum se infundunt et dominari conantur, nam tunc in ipsamet sua sphaera sunt, et ibi jucundum quoddam seu ipsam suam vitam, inveniunt; 'ubi cadaver 
ibi aquilae.' </p>
