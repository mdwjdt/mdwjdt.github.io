<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4943节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4943.</strong>那些将功德置于善行和作为的人也在脚和脚底之下的低地。其中一些人觉得自己在砍柴。他们所在的地方非常冷，他们觉得只有劳动才能获得温暖。我也与这些人交谈过，并蒙允许问他们是否愿意离开那个地方。他们回答说，他们还没有通过劳动赚取足够的功德。不过，一旦这种状态结束，他们就会从那里得以释放。这些人同样是属世的，因为想靠功德赚取救恩的渴望并不是属灵的愿望。而且，他们视自己高人一等，其中一些人甚至看不起别人。在来世，这种人若得不到比其他人更大的喜乐，就会向主发怒；这就是为何当他们砍柴时，他们那堆柴下面似乎有主的某种东西，正是他们的愤怒造成了这种表象。但由于他们过着虔诚的生活，以这种方式行事是出于无知，而这种无知里面有某种纯真之物，所以天使定期被派到他们那里安慰他们。有时，在他们左上方会出现一些像绵羊的东西；一看见它，他们也会从中得到安慰。</p>

In the lower earth, under the feet and the soles of the feet, are also those who have placed merit in good deeds and in works. Some of them appear to themselves to cut wood. The place where they are 
is rather cold, and they seem to themselves to acquire warmth by their labor. With these also I conversed, and it was given me to ask them whether they wished to come out of that place. They replied that 
they had not yet merited it by their labor. But when this state has been passed through, they are taken out thence. These also are natural, because the desire to merit salvation is not spiritual; 
and moreover, they regard themselves as superior to others, and some of them even despise others. If such persons do not receive more joy than others in the other life, they are indignant against the 
Lord; and therefore when they cut wood there sometimes appears as it were somewhat of the Lord under the wood, and this from their indignation. But as they have led a pious life, and have acted in this 
way from ignorance, in which there was something of innocence, therefore angels are occasionally sent to them who console them. And sometimes there appears to them from above on the left as it were 
a sheep, at the sight of which they also receive consolation. </p>

On the lower earth beneath the feet and soles of the feet there are also those who have regarded good deeds and works to be meritorious. Many of these appear to themselves to be cutting pieces of wood. 
The place where they are is quite a cold one, but they seem to themselves to find warmth in the work they do. I talked to these people too and was allowed to ask them whether they wished to leave that 
place. Their replies were that they had not done enough meritorious work. But once this stage is completed they are released from there. These people likewise are natural, for the desire to earn salvation 
through merit is not a spiritual desire. What is more, they regard themselves to be those who are superior to others, and some of them are also contemptuous of others. If in the next life they 
do not receive greater joy than all others, they are angry with the Lord, which explains why sometimes when they are cutting pieces of wood, it appears as though something of the Lord is underneath 
their pile of wood - their anger being that which produces this appearance But because they have led a devout life and have acted in the ways they did out of ignorance that had some degree of innocence 
within it, angels are therefore sent to them periodically to console them. Sometimes, in addition, something that looks like a sheep appears from above on the left, and from this too they receive consolation 
when they see it </p>

</p><b>4943.</b>
In inferiore terra sub pedibus et plantis, etiam sunt illi qui meritum posuerunt in beneactis et operibus; plures eorum sibi apparent ligna secare; locus ubi sunt, est frigidior et videntur sibi calorem 
acquirere per laborem suum; cum illis etiam locutus sum, et illis dicere datum, numne vellent ex loco illo exire; </p>
<p>dicebant quod adhuc per laborem non meruerint; at eum status ille transactus 
est, tunc inde eximuntur.  Sunt etiam illi naturales, quia velle mereri salutem, non est spirituale; et praeterea praeferunt se aliis, {1} quidam etiam eorum contemnunt alios; illi si non gaudium 
prae reliquis in altera vita recipiunt, indignantur contra Dominum, quapropter cum secant ligna, quandoque apparet quasi quid Domini sub lignis, et hoc ex indignatione: sed quia vitam piam egerunt, 
et ex ignorantia ita fecerunt, in qua aliquid innocentiae fuit, ideo aliquoties angeli ad illos mittuntur, et illos consolantur; et praeterea apparet illis desuper a sinistro quandoque sicut ovis, 
ex qua visa etiam consolationem accipiunt. @1 i et$ </p>
