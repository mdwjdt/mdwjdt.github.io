<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1533节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1533.</strong>在我的视觉被打开之前，我对出现在来世中的无数事物所持的观念和其他人差不多。也就是说，我也认为来世没有光，也没有诸如出自光的事物，以及感官物体。这种观念源自学者们对于非物质所持有的谬见，他们在谈及灵人及其生活中的一切事物时反复断言这种非物质。因此，除了将非物质的东西想象为头脑无法理解的东西，或什么也没有之外，就没有其它概念了，因为这就是非物质的含义。然而，真相完全相反，因为若灵人没有器官，天使不是由有机实质构成，他们就无法说话、看见和思考。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1533.</strong> Until my eyes were opened, I almost inevitably cherished the same idea as others about the countless wonders that appear in the next world. I thought that neither light nor the kind of phenomena light creates 钬?to say nothing of sensory powers 钬?could possibly exist in the next world. This thinking grew out of a delusion that the well-educated adopt concerning immateriality, which they ascribe so broadly to spirits and to everything in a spirit's life. Such a delusion could yield only one way to conceive of anything spiritual: that because it lacked matter, either it was too vague to be grasped in any way or it was nothing at all. That is what "immaterial" means, of course. The reality is diametrically opposed. If spirits were not organic 钬?and if angels were not made of organic substance{*1} 钬?they would not be able to speak or see or think.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the meaning of "organic substance," see note 1 in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1533/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1378" target=_top>1378</a>.

Before my sight was opened, the idea I cherished concerning the countless things that appear in the other life differed but little from that of others, that is to say, that in the other life there could 
be no light, and such things as exist from light, together with the things of sense; a notion derived from the phantasy entertained by the learned respecting the immateriality which they predicate 
so strongly of spirits and of all things pertaining to their life; from which no other conception could be had, than that, because it was immaterial, it was either so obscure that no idea of it could 
be grasped, or that it was nothing; for the immateriality involves such things. And yet the fact is just the reverse; for unless spirits were organized, and unless angels were organized substances, they 
could neither speak, nor see, nor think. </p>

Before my sight was opened I was scarcely able to entertain any different idea than that entertained by others about the countless things to be seen in the next life. I had thought that light and such 
things as come from it, as well as the objects of the senses, did not exist at all in the next life. This was the result of the delusion under which the learned labour about the immaterial, which they 
harp on so much in speaking of spirits and everything in their life. In consequence it was impossible to conceive of anything immaterial except as either something too obscure to be grasped by the 
mind, or as nothing, for that is what immaterial implies The reality however is altogether the reverse, for unless spirits had organs and angels were made of organic substance, they could neither speak, 
nor see, nor think. </p>

</p><b>1533.</b>
De innumerabilibus quae in altera vita apparent, antequam visus mihi apertus fuit, vix potui aliam ac alii, fovere ideam; nempe quod lux, et talia quae existunt ex luce, praeter sensitiva, nullatenus 
dari potuissent in altera vita, et hoc ex eruditorum capta phantasia de immateriali, quod praedicant tantopere de spiritibus et de omnibus quae sunt vitae illorum, ex quo non alius conceptus haberi 
potuit quam quod quia immateriale, esset vel tale obscurum ut nusquam capi aliqua idea posset, vel esset nullum, nam immateriale tale involvit; cum tamen prorsus contrarium est; nisi enim spiritus organici 
essent, et angeli substantiae organicae, nec loqui potuissent, nec videre, nec cogitare. </p>
