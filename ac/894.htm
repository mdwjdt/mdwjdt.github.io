<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第894节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>894.</strong>“正月初一日一开始”表一个起点。这一点从前面所述清楚可知。这句话所包含的一切太过深奥，以至于难以描述，只能说并没有人彻底重生到他能说“我现在是完美的”这样一个时间段。因为人皆有无数恶与假的状态，不仅有简单的状态，而且也有各种复杂的状态，它们必须被摆脱到不再重现的程度，如前所述。人在有些状态下可以说相当完美，但在很多其它状态下则不然。在来生，那些在肉身生活时就已重生，并且信主、对邻舍仁爱之人会不断被完善。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]894.</strong> The symbolism of in the beginning, on the first of the month, as a starting point is now evident.<br />Additional implications of these words are too deep to describe. The important thing is that the time it takes to regenerate is not fixed, in such a way that we can say, "Now I have finished." The states of evil and falsity that each of us has inside are beyond counting. They exist not only as individual states but also as multilayered composites and need to be dispelled to the point where they no longer appear, as already noted [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_894/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_719" target=_top>719</a>]. In some of our states we can be described as more perfect, but in countless others we cannot. In the other life, those who were reborn during bodily life and who lived lives of faith in the Lord and charity toward their neighbor are constantly being perfected. </p>

In the beginning, on the first of the month. That this signifies a first boundary [or new beginning], is now evident from what has been shown. What is further involved in these words is too deeply hidden 
to be described any further than that there is no definite period of time within which man's regeneration is completed, so that he can say, "I am now perfect;" for there are illimitable states of 
evil and falsity with every man, not only simple states but also states in many ways compounded, which must be so far shaken off as no longer to appear, as said above. In some states the man may be said 
to be more perfect, but in very many others not so. Those who have been regenerated in the life of the body and have lived in faith in the Lord and in charity toward the neighbor, are continually 
being perfected in the other life. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 894</b></p><p><b>894.</b>
'At the beginning, on the first of the month' means a starting point. This is now clear from what has been said above. Everything that this statement embodies is an arcanum so deep that it cannot be 
described, except for just the point that no definite period of time ever exists when anyone is regenerate enough to be able to say, 'Now I am perfect'. In fact an unlimited number of states of evil and 
falsity exist with everyone, not only simple states but also varied and complex ones which, as has been stated, have to be disposed of in such a way that they do not recur. In some states a person 
can be called fairly perfect, but in countless others he cannot. People who have been regenerated during their lifetime, and in whose lives faith in the Lord and charity towards the neighbour have been 
present, are in the next life being perfected all the time. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 894</b>
</p><b>894.</b>
'In principio in primo mensis': quod significent terminum primum, inde nunc constat. Quae praeterea haec involvunt, sunt arcaniora quam ut ita describi possint, solum quod non determinatum sit tempus 
quo homo regeneratus est sic ut dicere queat quod 'Nunc perfectus sim'; sunt enim indefiniti status mali et falsi apud unumquemvis hominem, non solum status simplices sed etiam multifariam compositi, 
qui discutiendi sunt ita ut non appareant, ut dictam; in aliquibus statibus potest homo perfectior dici, sed in indefinitis aliis non ita; qui in vita corporis regenerati sunt, et qui in fide in Dominum 
inque charitate erga proximum vixerunt, in altera vita jugiter perficiuntur. </p>
