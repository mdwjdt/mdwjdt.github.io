Verses 12-15. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locust, and it shall come up upon the land of Egypt, and shall devour all the herb of the land, even all 
that the hail hath left. And Moses stretched out his rod over the land of Egypt, and Jehovah brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all the night; and when it was morning, the east wind 
brought the locust. And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the border of Egypt, very grievous; before it there was no such locust as this, and after it there shall not be 
such. And it covered the surface of the whole land, and the land was darkened; and it devoured all the herb of the land, and all the fruit of the tree which the hail had left; and there was not left 
any green thing in the tree and in the herb of the field, in the whole land of Egypt. "And Jehovah said unto Moses," signifies instruction; "Stretch out thy hand," signifies the rule of power; "over 
the land of Egypt for the locust," signifies that falsity may take possession of all the natural of the infesters; "and it shall come up upon the land of Egypt," signifies a pouring out into all things 
therein; "and shall devour all the herb of the land," signifies the consumption of all truth; "even all that the hail hath left," signifies which the former falsity has not consumed; "and Moses stretched 
out his rod over the land of Egypt," signifies the rule of the power of truth Divine over the whole natural of the infesters; "and Jehovah brought an east wind upon the land," signifies the means 
of destruction; "all that day, and all the night," signifies in everything of perception, both obscure and not obscure, with the infesters; "and when it was morning," signifies a state of heaven in 
order; "the east wind brought the locust," signifies dense falsity with the infesters through the means of destruction; "and the locust went up over all the land of Egypt," signifies the pouring out of 
falsity into all things of the natural; "and rested in all the border of Egypt," signifies from the extremes there; "very grievous," signifies that it pervaded all things and each; "before it there 
was no such locust as this, and after it there shall not be such," signifies that such falsity has not been from the first time of the church, and shall not be; "and it covered the surface of the whole 
land," signifies that it took possession of the ultimates of the natural mind; "and the land was darkened," signifies that falsity was brought in where truth was; "and it devoured all the herb of the 
land," signifies that it consumed all the memory-knowledge of truth; "and all the fruit of the tree which the hail had left," signifies all the knowing of good; "and there remained not any green thing," 
signifies that all sensitivity of truth was obliterated; "in the tree and in the herb of the field," signifies from the knowing and the memory-knowledge of the church; "in the whole land of Egypt," 
signifies on all sides in the natural. </p>

Verses 12-15 And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, and they will come up over the land of Egypt and devour every plant in the land, all that the hail 
has left. And Moses stretched out his rod over the land of Egypt, and Jehovah brought an east wind into the land the whole of that day and the whole night. Morning came, and the east wind brought the 
locusts. And the locusts came up over all the land of Egypt, and rested at all the border of Egypt; they were extremely severe. Before them there were no such locusts like them, and there will not be 
such after them. And they covered the surface of the whole land, and the land was darkened; and they devoured every plant in the land and all the fruit on the trees which the hail had caused to be left. 
And there was not left any green on tree and on plant of the field in the whole land of Egypt.  </p>
<p>'And Jehovah said to Moses' means instruction. 'Stretch out your hand' means an exercising of power. 
'Over the land of Egypt for the locusts' means in order that falsity may take possession of the whole natural of the molesting ones. 'And they will come up over the land of Egypt' means an outpouring 
into everything there. 'And devour every plant in the land' means the total consumption of all truth. 'All that the hail has left' means which the previous falsity has not consumed. 'And Moses stretched 
out his rod over the land of Egypt' means exercising the power of God's truth over the entire natural of the molesting ones. 'And Jehovah brought an east wind' means an agent of destruction. 'The 
whole of that day and the whole of that night' means all the perception, both that which was darkened and that which was not darkened, of the molesting ones. 'Morning came' means the state of heaven 
in rearranged order. 'And the east wind brought the locusts' means massive falsity present with the molesting ones, brought by the agent of destruction. 'And the locusts came up over all the land of 
Egypt' means the outpouring of falsity into everything in the natural. 'And rested at all the border of Egypt' means at the outermost parts there. 'They were extremely severe' means that they penetrated 
every single part. 'Before them there were no such locusts like them, and there will not be such after them' means that no such falsity has existed since the Church first began, and such will not 
exist again. 'And they covered the surface of the whole land' means that they took possession of the last and lowest levels of the natural mind. 'And the land was darkened' means that falsity was introduced 
where there had been truth. 'And they devoured every plant in the land' means that it consumed every known fact about truth. 'And all the fruit on the trees' means every recognition of good. 'And 
they did not allow any green to be left' means the obliteration of every sensory apprehension of truth. 'On tree and on plant of the field' means belonging to the things the Church recognized and 
knew. 'In the whole land of Egypt' means on every side in the natural. </p>

Vers. 12-15.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Extende manum tuam super terram Aegypti ob locustam, et ascendet super terram Aegypti, et comedet omnem herbam terrae, omne quod reliquit grando.  Et extendit 
Moscheh baculum suum super terram Aegypti, et Jehovah adduxit ventum orientalem in terram toto die illo et tota nocte; mane factum, et ventus orientalis attulit locustam.  Et ascendit locusta super 
omnem terram Aegypti, et quievit in omni termino Aegypti, gravis valde; ante illam non fuit ita locusta sicut illa, et post illam non erit ita.  Et obtexit superficiem totius terrae, et obtenebrata 
terra, et comedit omnem herbam terrae, et omnem fructum arboris, quem residuum fecit grando; et non residuum fuit ullum viride in arbore et in herba agri in tota terra Aegypti.  `Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen' 
significat instructionem: {1}`Extende manum tuam' significat dominium potentiae: `super terram Aegypti ob locustam' significat ut falsum occupet infestantium omne naturale: `et ascendet super 
terram Aegypti' significat (x)effusionem in omnia ibi: `et comedet omnem herbam terrae' significat consumptionem totalem omnis veri: `omne quod reliquit grando' significat quod prius falsum non consumpsit: 
`et extendit Moscheh baculum suum super terram Aegypti' significat dominium potentiae veri Divini super infestantium totum naturale: `et Jehovah adduxit ventum orientalem' significat destructionis 
medium: `toto die illo et tota nocte illa' significat in omne perceptionis, tam obscurae quam non obscurae, {2}apud infestantes: `mane factum' significat statum caeli in ordine: `et ventus orientalis 
attulit locustam' significat falsum densum apud infestantes per medium destructionis: `et ascendit locusta super omnem terram Aegypti' significat falsi effusionem in omnia naturalis: `et quievit in 
omni termino Aegypti' significat ab extremis ibi: `gravis valde' significat quod pervaderet omnia et singula: `ante illam non fuit ita locusta sicut illa, et post illam non ita erit' significat quod 
tale falsum non fuerit a primo tempore Ecclesiae, et quod non tale erit: `et obtexit superficiem totius terrae' significat quod occuparet ultima mentis naturalis: `et obtenebrata terra' significat quod 
induceretur falsum ubi verum: `et comedit omnem herbam terrae' significat quod consumeret omne scientificum veri: `et omnem fructum arboris' significat omne cognitivum boni: `et non residuum fecit ullum 
viride' significat quod obliteraretur omne sensitivum veri: `in arbore et in herba agri' significat ex cognitivo et scientifico Ecclesiae: `in tota terra Aegypti' significat undequaque in naturali. 	@1
