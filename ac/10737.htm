<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10737</strong>.然后，他们被问到自己对神持有什么样的观念。他们回答说，他们并没有把神想象为一位不可见的神，而是想象为在人的形式之下的一位可见的神；他们以这种方式认识祂，不仅是因为内在的觉察，还因为祂曾作为一个人向他们显现。他们补充说，他们若按照某些访客，包括传教士的观念，真的把神想象为一位不可见的神，根本就无法思想神，因为不可见的东西无法落入任何思维观念。我意识到这是因为对他们来说，任何不可见的事物都缺乏形式，因而没有具体的品质；没有形式和品质的观念要么消散，要么降至自然界可见事物的层次。听完全这些话，我被引导对他们说，他们以人的形式思想神是对的，来自我们地球的许多人也以这种方式思想祂，尤其在思想主的时候；古人并不以其它方式思想祂。于是我告诉他们亚伯拉罕、罗得、基甸、玛挪亚和他的妻子，以及在我们的圣言中所提到的关于他们的事，即：这些人看见了在一个人的形式之下的神，当看见祂时，他们承认祂是宇宙的创造者，称祂为耶和华。我说，他们也是出于一种内在觉察而承认祂是宇宙的创造者的；但如今，这种内在觉察已经在基督教界消失了，只在简单的信仰者中间还有存留。</p>

They were next asked what idea they have about God. They replied that they do not conceive of an invisible God, but of a visible God under the human form; and that they know this not only from interior 
perception, but also from His having appeared to them as a Man, adding that if according to the idea of some of their visitors, and of the preacher, they were to conceive of God as invisible, they 
could not think of God at all, because what is invisible does not fall into any idea of thought. I perceived that this was because what is invisible was to them without form, thus without quality; and 
an idea that is without form and quality is either dissipated or falls to nature, which is visible. After hearing these things, it was given to say to them that they do well to think of God under the 
human form; and that many from our earth think in like manner, especially when they think of the Lord; and that the ancients thought in no other manner. I then told them about Abraham, about Lot, about 
Gideon, and about Manoah and his wife, and what is related about them in our Word, namely, that they saw God under a human form, and that when they saw Him they acknowledged Him as the Creator of the 
universe, and called Him Jehovah, and this also from interior perception; but that at this day such interior perception has perished in the Christian world, and remains only with the simple who are 
in faith. </p>

Then they were asked what kind of idea they themselves had of God. They replied that they did not conceive of Him as an invisible God but as a visible God in human form, and that they knew Him in this 
way as a result not only of inner perception but also of His having appeared to them as a human being. They added that if they were to conceive of God as one who was invisible, in the way that some 
of those who had come to them did, including the preacher, they could have no thought at all of God, since no idea can be formed in the mind of something which is invisible. I realized that this was so 
because to them anything invisible was lacking in form and so had no specific quality, and any idea which lacks these either melts away or descends to the level of things visible in the natural order. 
Having heard all this I was led to say to them that they did right to think of God in human form, and that many from our planet thought of Him in a similar way, especially when they thought of the 
Lord, and that the ancients had thought of Him in no other way. I told them then about Abraham, Lot, Gideon, and Manoah and his wife, and what is mentioned in our Word regarding them, namely that these 
people saw God in human form, and when they saw Him they acknowledged Him to be the Creator of all things, and called Him Jehovah. I said that they also acknowledged Him to be such from an inner perception; 
but at the present day that perception has perished in the Christian world and remains only with simple believers.  </p>

Interrogati dein qualem illi ideam {1}haberent de Deo; respondebant quod non concipiant Deum invisibilem sed Deum visibilem sub humana forma, et quod hoc non modo sciant ex interiore perceptione sed 
etiam ex eo quod apparuerit illis ut homo, addentes quod si secundum quorumdam advenarum (c)et praedicatoris ideam conciperent Deum ut invisibilem, nequaquam possent cogitare de Deo, quoniam invisibile 
non cadit in ideam cogitationis; percepi quod ideo quia invisibile illis erat absque forma ita absque quali, (c)ac idea, quae absque illis est, vel dissipatur vel cadit in naturam quae visibilis.  
His auditis dicere illis dabatur quod bene faciant quod cogitent de Deo {2} sub humana forma, et quod multi ex nostra tellure similiter cogitent, imprimis cum de Domino, et quod antiqui non aliter cogitaverint; 
narrabam tunc de Abrahamo, de Lotho, de Guideone, deque Manoacho et ejus uxore, et quid de illis memoratur in nostro Verbo, quod nempe viderint Deum sub humana forma, et visum agnoverint pro 
Creatore universi, et vocaverint Jehovam, et hoc quoque ex interiore perceptione; sed quod hodie interior illa perceptio in orbe Christiano perierit, ac modo remaneat apud simplices qui in fide. @1
