<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5683.</strong>创世记43:29-34.约瑟举目看见他的兄弟便雅悯，他母亲的儿子，就说，你们向我所说那最小的兄弟就是这位吗？又说，我儿阿，愿神赐恩给你。约瑟的悲悯向他的兄弟发动，他就急忙寻找可哭之地，进入自己的卧房，在那里哭了一场。他洗了脸出来，克制自己说，摆饭。他们就为约瑟单摆了一席，为他们单摆了一席，也为和约瑟同吃饭的埃及人单摆了一席，因为埃及人不可和希伯来人一同吃饭。那原是埃及人所憎恶的。他们坐在约瑟面前，头生的照着长子的名分，最小的照着他的年幼，这些人就彼此对望，惊奇不已。约瑟把他面前的那份给了他们，但给便雅悯的那份比他们所有人的份都多五倍。他们就饮酒，和约瑟一同畅饮。<br />“约瑟举目”表反思。“看见便雅悯”表对居间层的洞察。“他的兄弟，他母亲的儿子”表从属世层，如同从它的母亲所生的内在。“就说”表察觉。“你们向我所说那最小的兄弟就是这位吗”表在他们所有人之后出生的，这也是他们所十分清楚的。“又说，我儿阿，愿神赐恩给你”表神性也与属天层的属灵层，就是居间层同在，因为它从属灵层的属天层，即源于神性的真理发出。“他就急忙”表来自至内层。“约瑟的悲悯发动”表出于爱的怜悯。“向他的兄弟”表向从他自己发出的内在。“寻找可哭之地”表出于爱的怜悯之情。“进入自己的卧房，在那里哭了一场”表在自己里面，以一种看不见的方式。“他洗了脸”表它采取措施确保这一点，或它如此安排。“出来”表通过移走。“克制自己”表隐藏。“说，摆饭”表对通过居间层与属世层中的真理联结的觉知。“他们就为约瑟单摆了一席，为他们单摆了一席”表内在似乎与它们分离的外在表象。“也为和约瑟同吃饭的埃及人单摆了一席”表处于颠倒次序的记忆知识的分离。“因为埃及人不可和希伯来人一同吃饭”表这些知识绝无可能与教会的真理并良善联结。“那原是埃及人所憎恶的”表他们处于对立面。“他们坐在约瑟面前”表他们按次序排列，这取决于他的在场。“头生的照着长子的名分，最小的照着他的年幼”表符合真理在良善之下所取的次序。“这些人就彼此对望，惊奇不已”表在他们当中每一个人里面所发生的状态变化。“约瑟把他面前的那份给了他们”表出于怜悯被应用于每一个人的良善。“但给便雅悯的那份比他们所有人的份都多”表赋予居间层的良善超过赋予属世层中的真理的良善。“五倍”表大量增多。“他们就饮酒”表在良善之下对真理的应用。”和约瑟一同畅饮”表大量。</p>

Verses 29-34. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his brother, his mother's son, and said, Is this your youngest brother, of whom ye spoke unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my 
son. And Joseph made haste, for his compassions were moved toward his brother; and he sought to weep, and he came to the bed-chamber, and wept there. And he washed his faces, and went out, and he restrained 
himself and said, Set on bread. And they set on for him alone, and for them alone, and for the Egyptians, who did eat with him, alone; because the Egyptians cannot eat bread with the Hebrews; because 
this is an abomination to the Egyptians. And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth; and the men were amazed, everyone at his companion. 
And he brought out portions from his faces unto them; and he multiplied Benjamin's portion above the portions of them all, five measures. And they drank and drank largely with him. "And he lifted 
up his eyes," signifies reflection; "and saw Benjamin," signifies a noticing of the intermediate "his brother, his mother's son," signifies the internal from the natural, as from a mother; "and said," 
signifies perception; "Is this your youngest brother, of whom ye spoke unto me?" signifies the one born after all, as was also known to them; "and he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son," signifies 
that the Divine is also with the spiritual of the celestial, which is the intermediate, because it proceeds from the celestial of the spiritual, which is truth from the Divine; "and Joseph made 
haste," signifies from the inmost; "for his compassions were moved," signifies mercy from love; "toward his brother," signifies toward the internal from itself; "and he sought to weep," signifies the 
effect of mercy from love; "and he came to the bed chamber, and wept there," signifies in itself, not apparently; "and he washed his faces," signifies that it is so arranged; "and went out," signifies 
by removal; "and he restrained himself," signifies by concealment; "and said, Set on bread," signifies perception of conjunction through the intermediate with truths in the natural; "and they set on 
for him alone, and for them alone," signifies outward appearance that the internal was as if separated from them; "and for the Egyptians, who did eat with him, alone," signifies separation of the memory-knowledges 
that are in inverted order; "because the Egyptians cannot eat bread with the Hebrews," signifies that they could not possibly be conjoined with the truth and good of the church; "because 
this is an abomination to the Egyptians," signifies that they are in opposition; "and they sat before him," signifies that they were set in order by his presence; "the firstborn according to his birthright, 
and the youngest according to his youth," signifies according to the order of truths under good; "and the men were amazed, everyone at his companion," signifies a change of state of each one 
among them; "and he brought out portions from his faces unto them," signifies goods applied to each one from mercy; "and he multiplied Benjamin's portion above the portions of them all," signifies good 
for the intermediate above the goods for the truths in the natural; "five measures," signifies much increased; "and they drank," signifies the application of truths under good; "and drank largely with 
him," signifies abundantly. </p>

Verses 29-34 And he lifted up his eyes and saw Benjamin his brother, his mother's son, and said, Is this your youngest brother, whom you said [something about] to me? And he said, God be gracious to 
you, my son. And Joseph hastened, because feelings of compassion were being roused in him towards his brother, and he sought [somewhere] to weep; and he went to his bedchamber and wept there. And he washed 
his face and went out; and he contained himself and said, Set on bread. And they set for him by himself, and for them by themselves and for the Egyptians eating with him by themselves; for the Egyptians 
cannot eat bread with the Hebrews, since that is an abomination to the Egyptians. And they sat in front of him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth; 
and the men were astonished [and looked] each at his companion. And he took portions from before his face to them, and he multiplied Benjamin's portion above the portions of all theirs - five measures 
more. And they drank, and drank plentifully with him.  </p>
<p>'And he lifted up his eyes' means reflection. 'And saw Benjamin' means a discernment of the intermediary. 'His brother, his mother's son' 
means the internal born from the natural as its mother. 'And said' means perception. 'Is this your youngest brother, whom you said [something about] to me?' means born after all of them, as they well 
knew. 'And he said, God be gracious to you, my son means that the Divine was also present with the spiritual of the celestial, which is the intermediary, because it goes forth from the celestial of 
the spiritual, which is truth from the Divine. 'And Joseph hastened' means from what is inmost. 'Because feelings of compassion were being roused in him' means mercy springing out of love. 'Towards his 
brother' means towards the internal going forth from himself. 'And he sought [somewhere] to weep' means an expression of mercy springing out of love. 'And he went to his bedchamber and wept there' means 
within itself, in an unseen manner. 'And he washed his face' means that it took steps to ensure this. 'And went out' means by means of a removal. 'And he contained himself' means a concealment. 'And 
said, Set on bread' means a perception of a joining, through the intermediary, to the truths in the natural. 'And they set for him by himself, and for them by themselves' means the outward appearance 
that the internal was seemingly separated from them. 'And for the Egyptians eating with him by themselves' means the separation of factual knowledge existing in an inverted state of order. 'For the 
Egyptians cannot eat bread with the Hebrews' means that these could not by any means be joined to the truth and good of the Church. 'Since that is an abomination to the Egyptians' means that they are 
in a contrary position. 'And they took their seats in front of him' means that they were ranged in order, as determined by his presence. 'The firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest 
according to his youth' means in conformity with the order truths take beneath good. 'And the men were astonished [and looked] each at his companion' means a change of state that took place in each one 
among them. 'And he took portions from before his face to them' means forms of good applied with mercy to each one. 'And he multiplied Benjamin's portion above the portions of all theirs' means the 
good imparted to the intermediary exceeded the forms of good imparted to the truths in the natural. 'Five measures more' means that it was much increased. 'And they drank' means the application of the 
truths beneath good. 'And drank plentifully' means in abundance. </p>

Vers. 29-34.  Et sustulit oculos suos, et vidit Benjaminem  fratrem suum, filium matris suae, et dixit, An hic frater vester minimus, quem dixistis ad me? et dixit, Deus gratiosus sit tibi, fili mi. 
 Et festinavit Joseph, quia commovebantur commiserationes ejus ad fratrem suum, et quaerebat flere, et venit cubiculum, et flevit ibi.  Et lavit facies suas, et exivit, et continuit se, et dixit, Ponite 
panem.  Et posuerunt illi soli, et illis solis, et Aegyptiis comedentibus cum eo solis, quia non possunt Aegyptii comedere cum Hebraeis panem, quia abominatio id Aegyptiis. Et sederunt coram eo, primogenitus 
secundum primogenituram suam, et minorennis secundum minorennitatem suam, et obstupuerunt viri quisque ad socium suum.  Et extulit portiones ex faciebus suis ad illos, et multiplicavit portionem 
Benjaminis prae portionibus omnium illorum quinque mensuris; et bibebant, et large bibebant cum eo.  `Et sustulit oculos suos' significat reflexionem:  `et vidit Benjaminem' significat apperceptionem 
medii:  `fratrem suum, filium matris suae' significat internum a naturali, ut a matre:  `et dixit' significat perceptionem:  `An hic frater vester minimus, quem dixistis ad me?' significat natum 
post omnes, ut quoque illis notum:  `et dixit, Deus gratiosus sit tibi, fili mi' significat quod Divinum etiam apud spirituale caelestis quod medium, quia procedit a caelesti spiritualis quod verum 
a Divino:  `et festinavit Joseph' significat ab intimo:  `quia commovebantur commiserationes ejus' significat misericordiam ex amore:  `ad fratrem suum' significat erga internum a se:  `et quaerebat flere' 
significat effectum misericordiae ex amore:  `et venit cubiculum, et flevit ibi' significat in se, non apparenter:  `et lavit facies suas' significat quod disponeret ita:  `et exivit' significat 
per remotionem:  `et continuit se' significat per occultationem:  `et dixit, Ponite panem' significat perceptionem conjunctionis per medium cum veris in naturali:  `et posuerunt illi soli, et illis solis' 
significat externam apparentiam quod internum quasi separatum ab illis:  `et Aegyptiis comedentibus cum eo solis' significat separationem scientificorum quae in inverso ordine: `quia non possunt 
Aegyptii comedere cum Hebraeis panem' significat quod nequaquam conjungi possent cum vero et bono Ecclesiae:  `quia abominatio id Aegyptiis' significat quod in opposito sint:`et {1}consederunt coram 
eo' significat quod disponerentur a sua praesentia:  primogenitus secundum primogenituram suam, et  minorennis secundum minorennitatem suam' significat secundum  ordinem verorum sub bono:  `et obstupuerunt 
viri quisque ad socium suum significat mutationem status cujusvis inter se:  `et extulit portiones ex faciebus suis ad illos' significat bona applicata unicuivis ex misericordia:  `et multiplicavit 
portionem Benjaminis prae portionibus omnium illorum' significat bonum medio supra bona veris in naturali:  `quinque mensuris' significat quod multum auctum:  `et bibebant' significat applicationem 
verorum sub bono: `et large bibebant {2}' significat abundanter. @1 thus A I here and 5703; cp. above.$ @2 A I o cum eo here and  5710; cp. above$ </p>
