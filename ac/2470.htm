<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2470节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2470.</strong>人活在肉身时，几乎没有意识到自己有内部记忆，因为那时，内部记忆与外部记忆几乎行如一体。事实上，内部记忆的思维观念流入外部记忆的事物中，犹如流入自己的器皿中，这二者在那里结合起来。这类似于天使并灵人和人说话时的情形；他们彼此交谈时，天使和灵人所用的观念就会流入这个人语言的话语中，从而与它们结合起来，以至于灵人们只知道他们在用这个人的母语说话。而事实上，观念是他们的，而观念所流入的话语则是这个人的。我常与灵人谈论这个话题。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2470</b></p><p><b>2470.</b>
Man, while living in the body, can scarcely be aware that he has an interior memory, because the interior memory then acts almost as one with his exterior memory; for the ideas of thought of the interior 
memory flow into the things in the exterior memory as into their vessels, and the two are there conjoined together. It is as when angels and spirits are speaking to a man; for then the ideas of the 
former, by which they converse with each other, flow into the words of the man's language, and so conjoin themselves with them that the spirits know no otherwise than that they are speaking the man's 
own language; when yet the ideas are theirs, and the words into which they flow are the man's; on which subject I have often spoken with spirits. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2470</b></p><p><b>2470.</b>
During his lifetime a person is scarcely capable of knowing that he has an interior memory since the interior memory during that time acts almost as one with his exterior memory. In fact the ideas which 
comprise thought and belong to the interior memory flow into the contents of the exterior memory as their own vessels and are joined together with them there. It is similar to when angels and spirits 
speak to man; at such times their ideas by means of which they speak to one another flow into the expressions of man's language. Their ideas join themselves to those expressions in such a way that 
they know no other than that they themselves are speaking in the man's own native tongue, when in fact the ideas are theirs but the expressions into which these flow are the man's. This is a matter I 
have frequently talked about to spirits. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2470</b>
</p><b>2470.</b>
Homo dum vivit in corpore, vix scire potest quod memoriam interiorem habeat, quia tunc memoria interior paene unum agit cum memoria ejus exteriore; ideae enim cogitationis quae sunt memoriae interioris, 
influunt id res quae in memoria exteriore sicut in sua vasa, ac ibi conjunguntur: se habet hoc similiter ac cum angeli et spiritus loquuntur cum homine, tunc ideae eorum per quas inter se loquuntur, 
influunt in voces linguae hominis, et cum iis se conjungunt ita ut non sciant aliter quam quod ipsi loquantur vernacula homini propria, cum tamen ideae sunt illorum, et voces in quas influunt, sunt 
hominis: de qua re cum spiritibus aliquoties locutus sum. </p>
