<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2044节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2044.</strong>“生下来第八日”表事物洁净的开始。这从“第八日”的含义清楚可知。“一周”是七天，表示状态或时间的整个时期，如改造、重生、试探的整个时期，无论具体的个人还是总体的教会。因此，一段时期被称为“一周”，无论这段时期是一千年、一百年、十年，还是数天、数小时、数分钟等，这可从第一卷所引用的经文清楚看出来（<a href="728.htm">728</a>节）。由于第八日是下一周的第一日，故它表示事物的开始。由此也清楚可知，由于割礼本身是洁净的一个代表形式，故它的时间，即第八日也是。并非未受割礼的在那日能进入更纯洁的状态，并因此被洁净。确切地说，由于“割礼”表示洁净，所以“第八日”表示这种洁净应一直持续下去，因而总是如同从一个新的开始进行。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2044</b></p><p><b>2044.</b>
And a son of eight days. That this signifies any beginning of purification whatever, is evident from the signification of "the eighth day." A "week," which is seven days, signifies an entire period of 
any state or time, as of reformation, of regeneration, of temptation, whether of man in particular, or of the church in general; thus a period is called a "week," whether it be one of a thousand years, 
of a hundred, of ten, or of as many days, hours, minutes, and so on (as may be seen from the passages cited in Part First, n. 728). And as the eighth day is the first day of a new week, it signifies 
any beginning whatever. This shows also that, as circumcision was itself a representative of purification, so also was the time of it, namely, the eighth day; not that they then entered into a purer 
state, and were purified on that account, but for the reason that, as "circumcision" signified purification, so "the eighth day" signified that this ought to be effected at all times, and thus always, 
as from a new beginning. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2044</b></p><p><b>2044.</b>
That 'a son eight days old' means any beginning whatever to purification is clear from the meaning of 'the eighth day'. 'A week', which consists of seven days, means the entire period of any state and 
length of time - of reformation, regeneration, or temptation, either of the individual in particular or of the Church in general. So the expression 'week' is used whether the period is one of a thousand 
years, or of a hundred, or of ten, or else one of days, hours, or minutes, and so on, as may become clear from the places quoted in Volume One, in <a href="728.htm">728</a>. And because the eighth day is the first day 
of the following week it here means any new beginning whatever. From this it is also clear that just as circumcision itself was a representative of purification, so also was the time when it took place, 
namely the eighth day. Not that the uncircumcised on that day entered a purer state and on that account were made pure. Rather even as 'circumcision' was a sign meaning purification, so 'the eighth 
day' meant that such purification ought to go on all the time and so always to be taking place as if from a new beginning. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2044</b>
</p><b>2044.</b>
`Et filius octo dierum': quod significet principium purificationis quodcumque, constat ex significatione `octavi diei'; `septimana' quae est septem dierum, significat integram periodum cujuscumque status 
et temporis, ut reformationis, regenerationis, tentationis, tam hominis in particulari quam Ecclesiae in communi; ita septimana dicitur periodus sive foret mille annorum, sive centum, sive decem, 
ita dierum, horarum, mutorum, et sic porro, quod a locis in Parte Prima n. 728 citatis constare potest; (m)et quia dies octavus est dies primus sequentis septimanae, hic significat principium quodcumque 
(n). Inde quoque constat quod sicut ipsa circumcisio fuit repraesentativam purificationis, ita etiam tempus, nempe octavus dies; non quod tunc intrarent in statum puriorem et quod ideo purificati 
essent, sed quia sicut circumcisio significabat purificationem, ita `octavus dies' quod fieri debeat omni tempore, et sic semper ut e novo principio. </p>
