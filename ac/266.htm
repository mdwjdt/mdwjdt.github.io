<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>266.</strong>每条律法、诫命皆有属天、属灵的源头，此处有关婚姻的法则——妻子当顺服丈夫的理智，也有属天、属灵的源头，因为女人按欲望行事，而欲望以自我为中心，不像男人那样理性。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]266.</strong> Every law and commandment has something heavenly and spiritual as its source and true origin. So this law for marriage stating that a wife should be under the influence of her husband's good sense also has a heavenly, spiritual origin, since she acts on desire, which is self-centered, and not so much from reason as a man does.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For a discussion of Swedenborg's attitudes toward gender, see the reader's guide, pages 55-56 [NCBSP: Available from Swedenborg Foundation]. [JSR] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 266</b></p><p><b>266.</b>
As every law and precept comes forth from what is celestial and spiritual, as from its true beginning, it follows that this law of marriage does so, which requires that the wife, who acts from desire, 
which is of what is her own, rather than from reason, like the man, should be subject to his prudence. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 266</b></p><p><b>266.</b>
Seeing that every law and every precept arises out of what is celestial and spiritual as its true source this law which has to do with marriages therefore does so too, it 'being a law which requires 
a wife, because she acts not so much from reason, as her husband does, but from desire which belongs to the proprium, to defer to her husband's better judgement (prudentia).  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 266</b>
</p><b>266.</b>
Quia omnis lex et omne praeceptum ex caelesti et spirituali, ut a suo vero principio, existit, sequitur quod haec quoque lex, quae est conjugiorum, ut uxor, quia ex cupiditate quae est proprii, non 
ita ex ratione ut vir agit, sit sub viri prudentia. </p>
