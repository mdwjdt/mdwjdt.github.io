<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8459节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8459.</strong>“像地上的白霜一样小”表良善形式的真理—不间断并流动。这从“小”和“像白霜一样”的含义清楚可知：“小”论及真理，如刚才所述；“像白霜一样”是指以良善的形式。真理之良善，就是属灵教会成员的良善（参看<a href="8458.htm">8458</a>节），之所以被比作白霜，是因为它比雪更形成一个连续的薄片。由微小的白色薄片构成的雪论及真理；而白霜因其连续性，或说因是最接近它的事物，故论及已经变成良善，也就是真理之良善的真理。“雪”论及真理，这一点从以下经文明显看出来：<br />当耶稣变形像时，祂的衣服放光，极其洁白，像雪一样。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可9.2.htm">9:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可9.3.htm">3</a>）<br />马太福音：<br />坟墓旁的天使像貌如同闪电，衣服洁白如雪。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.2.htm">28:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.3.htm">3</a>）<br />启示录：<br />我看见七灯台中间有一位好像人子；祂的头与发皆白，如白羊毛、如雪。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.13.htm">1:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.14.htm">14</a>）<br />耶利米哀歌：<br />她的拿细耳人比雪更亮，比奶更白。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀4.7.htm">4:7</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />求你用牛膝草洁净我，我就干净；求你洗涤我，我就比雪更白。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗51.7.htm">51:7</a>）<br />但以理书：<br />我观看，直到有宝座设立，亘古常在者就坐上去；祂的衣服洁白如雪，头发如纯净的羊毛。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.9.htm">7:9</a>）<br />在这些经文中，“雪”因其洁白而论及真理，衣服被比作雪，因为“衣服”在灵义上是指真理（<a href="4545.htm">4545</a>，<a href="4763.htm">4763</a>，<a href="5248.htm">5248</a>，<a href="5319.htm">5319</a>，<a href="5954.htm">5954</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>，<a href="6917.htm">6917</a>，<a href="6918.htm">6918</a>节）。由此明显可知“白霜”表示什么，即良善形式的真理。之所以说良善形式的真理是不间断并流动的，是因为真理是良善的形式，而良善是这个形式的生命，可以说是该形式的灵魂。</p>

Small as the hoar frost upon the earth. That this signifies truth in the form of good, consistent and flowing, is evident from the signification of "small," which is predicated of truth (of which just 
above), and from the signification of "as the hoar frost," as being to be in the form of good. The good of truth, which is the good of the man of the spiritual church (see n. 8458), is compared to hoar 
frost from the continuity of this as compared to snow. Snow, from being small and white, is predicated of truth; but hoar frost, from its continuity, is predicated of truth made good, which is the 
good of truth. That "snow" is predicated of truth is plain from the following passages: </p>
<p>     When Jesus was transfigured His vestments became shining, exceeding white as snow (Mark 9:23).      The 
angels at the sepulcher had an appearance as lightning, and clothing white as snow (Matt. 28:3).      I saw in the midst of the seven lampstands one like unto the Son of man; His head and His hairs were 
white as white wool, as snow (Rev. 1:13, 14).      Her Nazirites were whiter than snow, they were fairer than milk (Lam. 4:7).      Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; Thou shalt 
wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow (Ps. 51:7).      I beheld till the thrones were cast forth, and the Ancient of Days did sit; His garment was like white snow, and the hair of His head 
like clean wool (Dan. 7:9). In these passages "snow" is predicated of truth from its whiteness, and garments are compared to it, because "garments" in the spiritual sense denote truths (n. 4545, 4763, 
5248, 5319, 5954, 6914, 6917, 6918). From all this it is evident what is meant by "hoar frost," namely, truth in the form of good. Truth is said to be consistent and flowing in the form of good, because 
truth is the form of good, and good is the life of this form, and is as it were its soul. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8459</b></p><p><b>8459.</b>
'Tiny like hoar frost on the earth' means truth in the form of good - uninterrupted and flowing. This is clear from the meaning of 'tiny' as a word having reference to truth, dealt with immediately above; 
and from the meaning of 'like hoar frost' as in the form of good. The good of truth, the good existing with a member of the spiritual Church, <a href="8458.htm">8458</a>, is compared to hoar frost because it forms more 
of a continuous sheet than snow. Consisting of tiny white flakes snow has reference to truth, while hoar frost, being the nearest thing to it, has reference to truth that has become good, which is the 
good of truth. The use of 'snow' to refer to truth is evident from the following places: In Mark, </p>
<blockquote>
When Jesus was transfigured His clothes became glistening, intensely white like snow <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%209:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 9:3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In 
Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
The angel<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> at the tomb - his appearance was like lightning, and his garment white as snow. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2028:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 28:2, 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In John, </p>
<blockquote>
I saw in the midst of the seven lampstands one like the Son of 
Man. His head and hair were white, like white wool, like snow. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%201:13,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 1:13, 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
In Jeremiah, The Nazirites were brighter than snow, they were whiter than milk. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lam%204:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lam 4:7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In David, </p>
<blockquote>
You will purge 
me with hyssop and I shall become clean, You will wash me and I shall be made whiter than snow. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2051:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 51:7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Daniel, </p>
<blockquote>
I saw, until thrones were placed, and the Ancient of Days was seated. His 
clothing was white as snow, and the hair of His head like pure wool. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%207:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 7:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In these places 'snow' has reference to truth because of its whiteness, with which clothes are compared because 'clothes' 
in the spiritual sense are truths, <a href="4545.htm">4545</a>, <a href="4763.htm">4763</a>, <a href="5248.htm">5248</a>, <a href="5319.htm">5319</a>, <a href="5954.htm">5954</a>, <a href="6914.htm">6914</a>, <a href="6917.htm">6917</a>, <a href="6918.htm">6918</a>. From all this it is evident what 'hoar frost' means, namely truth in the form of good. Truth in the form of good 
is said to be uninterrupted and flowing because truth is a form that holds good, and good is the life and so to speak soul within that form.

`Minutum sicut pruina super terra': quod significet verum in forma boni consistens et fluens, constat ex significatione `minuti' quod praedicetur de vero, de qua mox supra, et ex significatione `sicut 
pruina' quod sit in forma boni; bonum veri, quod est bonum hominis Ecclesiae spiritualis, n. 8458, comparatur pruinae ex continuo respective ad nivem; nix ex minuto et albo praedicatur de vero, at 
pruina ex continuo praedicatur de vero facto bono, quod est bonum veri.  Quod nix praedicetur de vero, patet ab his locis: apud Marcum, Cum Jesus transformatus est, vestimenta Ipsius facta sunt splendentia, 
alba valde sicut nix, ix 3: </p>
<p>{1} apud Matthaeum, Angelis ad sepulcrum erat species sicut fulgur, et {2}indumentum album sicut nix, xxviii 2, 3: </p>
<p>apud Johannem, Vidi in medio septem candelabrorum 
similem Filio hominis, caput Ipsius, et (x)capilli albi sicut lana alba, sicut nix, Apoc. i 13, 14: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam, Albi erant naziraei prae nive, candidi erant prae lacte, Threni iv 7: </p>
<p>apud Davidem, Expiabis 
me hyssopo {3}et mundus fiam; lavabis me et prae nive dealbabor, Ps. li 9 [A.V. 7]: </p>
<p>apud Danielem, Videns fui usque dum throni projecti sunt, et Antiquus dierum sedit; vestis {4}Ejus 
sicut nix alba, et crinis capitis (c)Ejus sicut lana munda, vii 9; </p>
<p>in his locis `nix' praedicatur de vero ex albedine, {5}cui vestes comparantur, quia `vestes' in sensu spirituali sunt vera, n. 4545, 
4763, 5248, 5319, 5954, 6914, 6917, 6918; ex his patet quid `pruina,' quod {6} sit verum in forma boni.  Verum in forma boni consistens et fluens dicitur, quia verum est forma boni, et bonum est (c)illius 
formae vita (x)et quasi anima. 	@1 i et$ 	@2 indumento albo$ 	@3 ut$ 	@4 Ipsius$ 	@5 inde vestes comparantur nivi, nam$ 	@6 i nempe$ </p>
