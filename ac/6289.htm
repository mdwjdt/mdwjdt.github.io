<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6289节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6289.</strong>“便抓住他父亲的手”表一种流注进入他的模糊觉知所拥有的能力。这从“抓住手”的含义清楚可知，“抓住手”是指进入觉知能力的流注。因为当内在想通过流入外在而迫使它思考和意愿某事时，可以说就会抓住它。此处它抓住了“手”所表示的觉知能力。“手”表示能力 （参看<a href="878.htm">878</a>，<a href="3387.htm">3387</a>，<a href="4931.htm">4931</a>-<a href="4937.htm">4937</a>节）。之所以说觉知是模糊的，是因为相对于“约瑟”所代表的属天人，“以色列”所代表的属灵人居于模糊中。相对于属天人，属灵人居于模糊中（参看<a href="2708.htm">2708</a>，<a href="2715.htm">2715</a>，<a href="2716.htm">2716</a>，<a href="2718.htm">2718</a>，<a href="2831.htm">2831</a>，<a href="2849.htm">2849</a>，<a href="2935.htm">2935</a>，<a href="2937.htm">2937</a>，<a href="3833.htm">3833</a>，<a href="4402.htm">4402</a>节）。<br />属灵人居于模糊中，这一点从以下事实很清楚地看出来：重生之前，对于真理与良善，他们完全处于黑暗；当他们正在重生时，他们承认诸如其教会教义所包含的那种真理，而且信靠这真理，不管它是真是假。即便如此，当这真理成为其意愿和随之其生活的一部分时，正是该真理在他们那里变成良善。正是这良善被称为真理之良善，以及信之良善，同样被称为属灵良善，或属灵教会的良善。凡考虑这个问题的人都能看出，该良善的品质来自这个源头。然而，源于这种真理的良善，甚至是外邦人当中的，都蒙主悦纳，只要它以对邻之仁为起点或原则，并且这仁爱含有纯真在里面。</p>

And he laid hold of the hand of his father. That this signifies influx into the power of his obscure perception, is evident from the signification of "laying hold of the hand," as being influx into the 
power of perception; for when the internal desires by means of influx to compel the external to think and will something, it as it were takes hold of it, here of the power of perception that is signified 
by the "hand." (That the "hand" is power may be seen above, n. 878, 3387, 4931-4937.) That the perception is called obscure, is because relatively to the celestial, who are represented by Joseph, 
the spiritual, who are represented by Israel, are in obscurity. (That the spiritual are relatively in obscurity, may be seen above, n. 2708, 2715, 2716, 2718, 2831, 2849, 2935, 2937, 3833, 4402.) That 
the spiritual are in obscurity, is very evident from the fact that before they have been regenerated they are altogether in thick darkness with respect to truth and good, and that while they are being 
regenerated, it is such truth as is in the doctrine of their church that they acknowledge, and in which truth they have faith, whether it is true or not. Nevertheless it is this truth that becomes 
good with them when it becomes of the will and thence of the life, and then it is that good which is called the good of truth, and also the good of faith, and likewise spiritual good, or the good of 
the spiritual church. The quality of the good that is from such an origin may be known to everyone who considers the matter. Nevertheless the good from such truth, even with the Gentiles, is accepted 
by the Lord, provided it has for a principle or starting point charity toward the neighbor, and that in this charity there is innocence. </p>

'And he grasped his father's hand' means an influx into the power which his obscure discernment possessed. This is clear from the meaning of 'grasping the hand' as an influx into the power of discernment. 
For when the internal flows into the external, wishing to make it think and will something, it grasps hold of it so to speak. Here it takes hold of its power of discernment, meant by 'the hand'; 
for 'the hand' means power, see, <a href="878.htm">878</a>, <a href="3387.htm">3387</a>, <a href="4931.htm">4931</a>-<a href="4977.htm">4977</a>. The reason why that discernment is said to be obscure is that spiritual people, who are represented by 'Israel', dwell in obscurity compared with 
celestial ones, who are represented by 'Joseph'. For more about spiritual people and their dwelling in obscurity compared with celestial ones, see <a href="2708.htm">2708</a>, <a href="2715.htm">2715</a>, <a href="2716.htm">2716</a>, <a href="2718.htm">2718</a>, <a href="2831.htm">2831</a>, <a href="2849.htm">2849</a>, <a href="2935.htm">2935</a>, <a href="2937.htm">2937</a>, <a href="3873.htm">3873</a>, <a href="4401.htm">4401</a>. </p>

 The fact that spiritual people dwell in obscurity is plainly evident from the consideration that prior to regeneration they are altogether in the dark about what is true and good, and 
that when they are being regenerated it is truth such as that contained in the teaching of their Church that they acknowledge and in which they put their trust, irrespective of whether it is true or not. 
Even so it is this truth that becomes good with them when it becomes part of what they will and consequently of their life. It is that good which is called the good of truth, also the good of faith, 
as well as spiritual good or the spiritual Church's good. Anyone who turns his mind to the matter can see what is the essential nature of this good deriving from such an origin. Nevertheless good derived 
from that kind of truth, even among gentiles, is acceptable to the Lord, when it has charity towards the neighbour as its chief concern and when that charity has innocence within it. </p>

`Et apprehendit manum patris sui':  quod significet influxum in potentiam apperceptionis ejus obscurae, constat a significatione `apprehendere manum' quod sit influxus in potentiam apperceptionis; internum 
enim cum per influxum adigere vult externum ad aliquod cogitandum et volendum, quasi apprehendit illud, {1}hic potentiam apperceptionis quae per `manum' significatur; quod `manus' sit potentia, 
videatur n. 878, 3387, 4931-4937.  Quod apperceptio {2}dicatur obscura, est causa quia spirituales qui repraesentantur per `Israelem', (t)sunt in obscuro respective ad caelestes qui repraesentantur 
per `Josephum'; quod spirituales in obscuro sint respective, videatur n. 2708, 2715, 2716, 2718, 2831, 2849, 2935, 2937, 3833, 4402.  [2] {3} Quod spirituales in obscuro sint, patet manifeste ex eo quod 
antequam regenerati sunt, sint prorsus in caligine de vero et bono, et quod cum regenerantur, sit verum quale est in doctrina Ecclesiae eorum, quod agnoscunt, cui vero fidem habent sive id verum sit 
sive non verum; hoc verum usque est quod fit bonum apud illos cum fit voluntatis et inde vitae, et tunc est id bonum quod vocatur bonum veri, tum bonum fidei, ut et bonum spirituale seu bonum Ecclesiae 
spiritualis; quale id bonum sit quod ex tali origine, quisque potest scire qui expendit.  Sed usque bonum ex tali vero, etiam apud gentiles, acceptatur a Domino, dum pro principio habet charitatem 
erga proximum, et in charitate illa est innocentia. @1 sed non manum, verum$ @2 obscura fuerit, constare potest ex eo, quod$ @3 i quod nunc spirituale, quod est Israelem, fuerit in magis obscuro, 
significatur per quod oculi ejus graves essent prae senectute, n. 6256.$ </p>
