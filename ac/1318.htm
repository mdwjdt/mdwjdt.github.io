<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1318节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1318.</strong>“现在他们想要做的任何事，就没有什么可拦阻他们了”表除非他们现在的状态发生改变。这从下文清楚可知。圣言的内义具有这样的性质：它不断着眼于接下来的事物，以及结论，尽管这在字义上并不那么明显。具有上述特征的人无法从做他们想做的一切事中退出来，除非他们的状态发生改变。但从下文明显可知，他们的状态的确发生了变化。做事的想法无非是意图，即目的。人所怀的目的永远无法被阻止，除非他的状态发生改变。因为目的是一个人最根本的生命，如前所述。一旦状态发生改变，目的，连同与之一起的思维也会随之改变。至于该教会成员发生了哪种性质的状态变化，蒙主怜悯，容后再述。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1318.</strong> The fact that and now nothing would be prohibited to them that they thought to do means unless their status now changes can be seen from what follows. The Word's inner meaning is such that it constantly focuses on what follows and on the ending, even when this focus is not evident in the literal meaning.<br />With people like those described above, nothing is prohibited that they think to do, unless their circumstances change. What follows will show that their circumstances did indeed change.<br />The thought of doing something is the same as an intention, or in other words, a purpose. No human purpose can ever be prevented — changed, in other words — unless conditions change in the person, because our final goal constitutes our actual life, as I said. When conditions change in us, our goal also changes, and with the goal, our thinking. What change in status occurred for the people of this church will be told below, by the Lord's divine mercy. </p>

And now nothing will be withholden from them of all which they have thought to do. That this signifies unless their state is now changed, may be seen from what follows. The internal sense of the Word 
is of such a nature that it keeps constantly in view the things that follow, and also the conclusion, although this does not appear to be so in the literal sense. As regards those who are of the character 
described above, unless their state were changed, they could not be withheld from doing all they thought of doing. But that their state was changed, is evident from what follows. The thought of 
doing is nothing else than the intention, that is, the end. The end with a man can never be withheld, that is, changed, unless his state is changed; for the end is the very life of a man, as was said. 
When the state is changed, the end also is changed; and with the end the thought. The nature of the change of state that took place with the man of this church, will of the Lord's Divine mercy be shown 
in what follows. </p>

'And now they will not be held back from anything which they have thought of doing' means unless their state is now altered. This becomes clear from what follows. The internal sense of the Word is such 
that it looks continually to the things that follow, and the conclusion, although this is not so apparent in the literal sense. The kind of people described above are not held back from what they think 
of doing unless their state is altered The fact that their state was indeed altered is clear from what follows. To think of doing something is nothing else than intention, that is, the end in view 
And the end a person has in view cannot possibly be held back, that is, altered unless his state is altered. For, as has been stated, a person's end in view is his very life. When his state is altered 
so is the end in view, and along with that end the thought as well. What kind of a change of state took place among the members of this Church will in the Lord's Divine mercy be stated later on. </p>

</p><b>1318.</b>
'Et nunc non prohiberetur ab iis omne quod cogitarunt facere':  quod significet nisi nunc status eorum mutetur, constare potest a sequentibus; sensus internus Verbi est ut continue spectet sequentia, 
et conclusum, tametsi in sensu litterali non ita apparet:  qui tales sunt ut qui supra descripti, nisi status eorum mutatur, non apud eos prohibetur quod cogitant facere; quod etiam status eorum mutatus 
sit, constat a sequentibus. Cogitatio faciendi non aliud est quam intentio, hoc est, finis; finis apud hominem nusquam prohiberi potest, hoc est, mutari nisi status; nam finis est ipsa vita hominis, 
ut dictum; dum mutatur status etiam mutatur finis et cum fine cogitatio; qualis mutatio status hominis hujus Ecclesiae facta sit, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, dicetur in sequentibus. </p>
