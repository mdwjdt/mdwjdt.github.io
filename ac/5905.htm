Verses 9-13. Haste ye and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus hath said thy son Joseph, God hath set me for lord to all Egypt; come down unto me, tarry not; and thou shalt dwell in the land of 
Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy sons, and thy sons' sons, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast; and I will sustain thee there; for there are yet five years of famine: 
lest thou be rooted out, thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast. And behold your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that with my mouth I am speaking unto you. And ye shall 
tell my father all my glory in Egypt, and all that ye have seen; and haste ye, and bring down my father hither. "Haste ye and go up to my father," signifies to spiritual good; "and say unto him, Thus 
hath said thy son Joseph," signifies the perception of this good about the internal celestial; "God hath set me for lord to all Egypt," signifies that it arranges each and all things in the natural; "come 
down unto me, tarry not," signifies sure conjunction; "and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen," signifies the midst in the natural; "and thou shalt be near unto me," signifies perpetual conjunction; 
"thou, and thy sons, and thy sons' sons," signifies spiritual good and all things that are from it and that are from these; "and thy flocks, and thy herds," signifies natural good interior and 
exterior; "and all that thou hast," signifies whatever is therefrom; "and I will sustain thee there," signifies continuous influx of spiritual life from the internal celestial; "for there are yet five 
years of famine," signifies the duration of the lack of good; "lest thou be rooted out," signifies lest it perish; "thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast," signifies spiritual good and all 
that belongs to it; "and behold your eyes see," signifies a testifying from perception; "and the eyes of my brother Benjamin," signifies from the perception of the intermediate; "that with my mouth I 
am speaking unto you," signifies manifestation; "and ye shall tell my father all my glory in Egypt," signifies the communication of the spiritual heaven in the natural with spiritual good; "and all that 
ye see," signifies whatsoever was there noticed and perceived; "and haste ye, and bring down my father hither," signifies close conjunction. </p>

Verses 9-13 Make haste and go up to my father, and say to him, Thus said your son Joseph: God has established me as lord for all Egypt; come down to me, do not delay. And you shall dwell in the land 
of Goshen, and you shall be near to me, you and your sons, and the sons of your sons, and your flocks, and your herds, and everything that belongs to you. And I will sustain you there, for there are still 
five years of famine, lest perhaps you are wiped out, you and your household, and all that belongs to you. And behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that with my mouth I am 
speaking to you. And you must tell my father about all my glory in Egypt, and all that you see; and you must make haste, and cause my father to come down here.  </p>
<p>'Make haste and go up to my father' 
means to spiritual good. 'And say to him, Thus said your son Joseph' means the perception this good had regarding the internal celestial. 'God has established me as lord for all Egypt' means that it sets 
in order every single thing in the natural. 'Come down to me, do not delay' means a sure joining together. 'And you shall dwell in the land of Goshen' means the middle of the natural. 'And you shall 
be near to me' means an everlasting joining together. 'You and your sons, and the sons of your sons' means spiritual good, and all derivatives from it, and further derivatives from these. 'And your 
flocks, and your herds' means natural good, interior and exterior. 'And everything that belongs to you' means whatever is dependent on that good. 'And I will sustain you there' means a constant influx 
of spiritual life from the internal celestial. 'For there are still five years of famine' means the duration of the lack of good. 'Lest perhaps you are wiped out' means lest it perishes. 'You and your 
household, and all that belongs to you' means spiritual good and everything belonging to it. 'And behold, your eyes see' means attesting as a result of perception. 'And the eyes of my brother Benjamin' 
means especially as a result of perception by the intermediary. 'That with my mouth I am speaking to you' means a revelation. 'And you must tell my father about all my glory in Egypt' means a communication 
of the spiritual heaven in the natural with spiritual good. 'And all that you see' means whatever is recognized and perceived there. 'And you must make haste, and cause my father to come down 
here' means a closer joining together. </p>

Vers.  9-13.  Festinate et ascendite ad patrem meum, et {1}dicatis ad illum, Ita dixit filius tuus Joseph, Posuit me Deus ad dominum omni Aegypto, descende ad me, ne subsistas. Et habitabis in terra 
Goshen, et eris propinquus ad me, tu et filii tui, et filii filiorum tuorum, et greges tui, et armenta tua, et omne quod tibi. Et sustentabo te ibi, quia adhuc quinque anni famis, ne forte exstirperis 
tu et domus tua, et omne quod tibi. Et ecce oculi vestri vident, et oculi fratris mei Benjamin, quod ore loquens ad vos. Et indicetis patri meo omnem gloriam meam in Aegypto, et omne quod videtis, et 
festinetis, et descendere faciatis patrem meum huc. `Festinate et ascendite ad patrem meum' significat ad bonum spirituale: `et dicatis ad illum, Ita dixit filius tuus Joseph' significat perceptionem 
illius de caelesti interno: `Posuit me Deus ad dominum omni Aegypto' significat quod disponat omnia et singula in naturali: `descende ad me, ne subsistas' significat conjunctionem certam: `et habitabis 
in terra Goshen' significat medium in naturali:  `et eris propinquus ad me' significat conjunctionem perpetuam: `tu et filii tui, et filii filiorum tuorum' significat bonum spirituale, et omnia quae 
ab illo, et quae ab his: `et greges tui, et armenta tua' significat bonum naturale interius et exterius: `et omne quod tibi' significat quicquid ab illo: 'et sustentabo te ibi' significat continuum 
influxum vitae spiritualis a caelesti interno:  `quia adhuc quinque anni famis' significat durationem defectus boni: `ne forte exstirperis' significat ne pereat: `tu et domus tua, et omne quod tibi' 
significat bonum spirituale et omne illius:  `et ecce oculi vestri vident' significat testificationem ex perceptione: `et oculi fratris mei Benjamin' significat {2}imprimis a perceptione medii:  `quod 
ore loquens ad vos' significat manifestationem: `et indicetis patri meo omnem gloriam meam in Aegypto' significat communicationem caeli spiritualis in naturali cum bono spirituali: `et omne quod videtis' 
significat quicquid ibi apperceptum et perceptum:  `et festinetis, et descendere faciatis patrem meum huc' significat conjunctionem arctam. @1 I, here only, dicetis$ @2 I o here only$ </p>
