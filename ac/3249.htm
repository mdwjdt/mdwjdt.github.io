<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3249节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3249.</strong>“向东到东方之地去”表向着信之良善。这从下文所论述的“东”和“东方之地”的含义清楚可知。“东方之地”所表示的信之良善无非是圣言中所谓的对邻之仁；而对邻之仁无非是遵守主诫命的生活。这就是“东方之地”所表示的（<a href="1250.htm">1250</a>节）。因此，那些具有对信之良善的认知之人被称为“东方人”（sons of the east）。东方人之地就是亚兰或叙利亚。亚兰或叙利亚代表对良善的认知（参看<a href="1232.htm">1232</a>，<a href="1234.htm">1234</a>节）；亚兰-纳哈拉姆或两河之间的叙利亚代表对真理的认知（<a href="3051.htm">3051</a>节）。由于“叙利亚人”或“东方人”表示那些具有对良善与真理的认知之人，所以他们尤其被视为“智者或博士”（the wise）。如在列王纪上，经上论到所罗门说：<br />所罗门的智慧超过所有东方人的智慧。（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上4.30.htm">4:30</a>）<br />又如在马太福音，经上论到耶稣出生时来到他那里的人说：<br />有几个博士从东方来到耶路撒冷，说：那生下来作犹太人之王的在哪里？我们在东方看见祂的星，特来拜祂。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太2.1.htm">2:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太2.2.htm">2</a>）<br />事实上，古教会最后的余民就在叙利亚，因此那地仍存留着对良善与真理的认知。这也可从巴兰清楚看出来，他不仅敬拜耶和华，还作出关于主的预言，称祂是“出于雅各的星，兴于以色列的杖” （民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.17.htm">24:17</a>）。巴兰是住在叙利亚的东方人，这是显而易见的，因为他在题诗歌时论到自己说：<br />巴勒引我出亚兰（或叙利亚），摩押王引我东山。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.7.htm">23:7</a>）<br />亚兰或叙利亚就是东方人所居住的地方，这一点从以下事实明显看出来，即：当雅各来到叙利亚时，经上说他到了“东方人之地”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创29.1.htm">29:1</a>）。</p>

Eastward to the land of the east. That this signifies to the good of faith, is evident from the signification of "the east" and the "land of the east," which will be treated of in what follows. The good 
of faith which is signified by the "land of the east," is no other than that which in the Word is called charity toward the neighbor; and charity toward the neighbor is nothing else than a life according 
to the Lord's commandments. That this is signified by the "land of the east" may be seen above (n. 1250); therefore they who were in the knowledges of the good of faith were called "sons of the 
east." The land of the sons of the east was Aram of Syria. (That Aram or Syria represents the knowledges of good, may be seen above, n. 1232, 1234; and that Aram Naharaim, or Syria of the rivers, represents 
the knowledges of truth, n. 3051.) And as by the "Syrians" or "sons of the east" were signified those who were in the knowledges of good and truth, they were preeminently called the "wise," as 
in the first book of Kings, where it is said of Solomon: </p>
<p>     The wisdom of Solomon was multiplied above the wisdom of all the sons of the east (1 Kings 4:30); </p>
<p>and as in Matthew, where it is said 
of those who came to Jesus when He was born: </p>
<p>     Wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, Where is He that is born king of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the east, and are come to worship 
Him (Matt. 2:1-2). For in Syria were the last remains of the Ancient Church, and therefore in that land there still remained the knowledges of good and truth, as can also be seen from Balaam, 
who not only adored Jehovah, but also prophesied concerning the Lord, and called Him the "Star out of Jacob, and the Scepter out of Israel" (Num. 24:17). That Balaam was of the sons of the east in Syria 
is manifest, for he says this of himself when he utters the declaration: </p>
<p>     From Syria hath Balak brought me, the king of Moab, from the mountains of the east (Num. 33:7). That it was Aram or Syria 
where the sons of the east dwelt, is evident from the fact that when Jacob went into Syria he is said to have gone "to the land of the sons of the east" (Gen. 29:1). </p>

'Eastwards to the land of the east' means towards the good of faith. This is clear from the meaning of 'the east' and 'the land of the east', to be dealt with below. The good of faith which is meant 
by 'the land of the east' is nothing else but that which in the Word is called charity towards the neighbour. And charity towards the neighbour is nothing else than a life according to the Lord's commandments. 
This is what 'the land of the east' means, see <a href="1250.htm">1250</a>. Those therefore who possessed cognitions regarding the good of faith were called 'the sons of the east'. The land of the sons of the east 
was Aram or Syria - Aram or Syria meaning cognitions of good, see <a href="1232.htm">1232</a>, <a href="1234.htm">1234</a>, and Aram Naharaim or Syria of the [Two] Rivers cognitions of truth, <a href="3051.htm">3051</a>. And because the Syrians, or 'the sons of the east' 
means those who possessed cognitions of good and truth, they above all others were referred to as wise, as in <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings where Solomon is referred to, </p>
<p>The wisdom of Solomon surpassed the wisdom of 
all the sons of the east. <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 4:30. </p>
<p>And in Matthew, in reference to those who came to Jesus at His birth, </p>
<p>Wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, Where is He who has been born King 
of the Jews? for we have seen His star in the east and have come to worship Him. Matt. 2:1, <a href="2.htm">2</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Indeed in Syria there existed the final remnants of the Ancient Church, which is why cognitions 
of good and truth still remained there, as also becomes clear from Balaam who not only worshipped Jehovah but also prophesied concerning the Lord and called Him, </p>
<p>A star out of Jacob and a sceptre out 
of Israel. Num. 24:17. </p>
<p>The fact that he belonged to the sons of the east in Syria is self-evident, for he says of himself when delivering his discourse, </p>
<p>From Syria Balak has brought me, the king 
of Moab from the mountains of the east. Num. 23:7. </p>
<p>The fact that Aram or Syria was where the sons of the east lived is made additionally clear from the consideration that when Jacob went to Syria 
he is said to have gone to the land of the sons of the east, Gen. 29:1. </p>

`Orientem versus, ad terram orientis': quod significet ad bonum fidei, constat ex significatione `orientis et terrae orientis,' de qua sequitur; bonum fidei quod significatur per `terram orientis' non 
aliud est quam quod in Verbo vocatur charitas erga proximum; et charitas erga proximum non aliud quam vita secundum praecepta Domini; quod per `terram orientis' illud significetur, videatur n. 1250; 
idcirco qui in cognitionibus boni fidei fuerunt, dicti sunt `filii orientis'; terra filiorum orientis erat Aram seu Syria; quod `Aram seu Syria' sint cognitiones boni, videatur n. 1232, 1234; et `Aram 
Naharaim seu Syria fluviorum' sint cognitiones veri, n. 3051, et quia per `Syros seu filios orientis' significati sunt qui in cognitionibus boni et veri, illi prae reliquis dicti sunt sapientes, ut 
in (x)1 Libro Regum, ubi de Salomone,           Multiplicata est sapientia Salomonis prae sapientia      omnium filiorum orientis, v 10 [A.V. iv 30]; </p>
<p>et apud Matthaeum, de illis qui venerunt ad Jesum 
cum natus,           Sapientes ab oriente venerunt Hierosolymam, dicentes, Ubi      est ille Rex Judaeorum, qui natus est? vidimus enim Ejus      stellam in oriente, et venimus ut adoremus Ipsum, 
ii 1, 2; </p>
<p>[2] in Syria enim erant ultimae reliquiae Ecclesiae Antiquae, quare ibi erant cognitiones boni et veri; ut quoque constare potest a Bileamo, qui non modo adoravit Jehovam, sed etiam de Domino 
prophetavit ac Ipsum vocavit           Stellam e Jacobo, et sceptrum ex Israele, Num. xxiv 17: </p>
<p>quod ille ex filiis orientis in Syria fuerit, patet, ipse enim de se dicit cum edidit enuntiatum suum,  
         E Syria adduxit me Balakus rex Moabi, de montibus      orientis, Num. xxiii 7: </p>
<p>quod Aram seu Syria fuerit ubi filii orientis, etiam constare potest ex eo quod, cum Jacobus in Syriam 
iret, dicitur `ivisse terram filiorum orientis,' Gen. xxix 1. </p>
