<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10635节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10635</strong>.“有你在他们中间的众百姓都要看见耶和华的作为”表凡接受圣言的人都会承认它里面的神性。这从“摩西”的代表和“看见耶和华的作为”的含义清楚可知：“摩西”是指圣言（参看<a href="9372.htm">9372</a>节提到的地方），因此，“有他在他们中间的百姓”表示有圣言存在的教会，因而表示凡接受圣言的人，因为其他人不承认圣言里面的神性；“看见耶和华的作为”是指承认它里面的神性。所表示的是这些事，这是显而易见的，因为在教会里面，凡过着良善生活的人都承认圣言里面的神性。原因在于，当他们阅读圣言时，一种来自天堂的神圣流注就会进入他们，尽管他们不知道，这一切是通过对应关系实现的。此外，这种依赖于对应关系的流注只被感觉为一种占据心智的大体神圣感。就那些没有过着良善的人而言，情况就不同了；对他们来说，天堂流入所经过的内在被关闭了。</p>

And all the people in the midst of whom thou art shall see the work of Jehovah. That this signifies that all by whom the Word is received will acknowledge the Divine therein, is evident from the representation 
of Moses, as being the Word (see at the places cited in n. 9372); consequently by "the people in the midst of whom he is," is signified the church where is the Word, thus all by whom the Word 
is received, for no others acknowledge the Divine therein; and from the signification of "seeing the work of Jehovah," as being to acknowledge the Divine therein. It is evident that this is the signification, 
because all those within the church who are in the good of life acknowledge the Divine in the Word. The reason is that while they are reading the Word there flows into them from heaven a holy 
feeling, although they do not know that this is effected by means of correspondences; nor is it perceived otherwise than as a general holy influence, in which the mind is kept. It is otherwise with 
those who are not in the good of life. With these the internal through which heaven flows in has been closed. </p>

'And all the people in whose midst you are will see the work of Jehovah' means that all who accept the Word will acknowledge the Divine within it. This is clear from the representation of 'Moses' as 
the Word, dealt with in the places referred to in <a href="9372.htm">9372</a>, so that 'the people in whose midst he is' means the Church where the Word exists, thus all who accept the Word, for others do not acknowledge the 
Divine within it; and from the meaning of 'seeing the work of Jehovah' as acknowledging the Divine within it. It is self-evident that such things are meant, for all within the Church who lead a good 
life acknowledge the Divine within the Word. The reason why they do so is that a holy influence from heaven enters them when they read the Word, although they do not know that correspondences are the 
means through which it comes to them. Furthermore this influence which depends on correspondences is not detected except as a general feeling of holiness occupying the mind. The situation is different 
in the case of those who do not lead a good life; in their case the internal through which influences from heaven come is closed.  </p>

</p><b>10635.</b>
`Et videbit omnis populus, cujus tu in medio ejus, opus Jehovae':  quod significet quod omnes a quibus Verbum recipitur agnoscent Divinum in eo, constat ex repraesentatione `Moschis' quod sit Verbum, 
de qua in locis citatis n. 9372; inde per `populum, in cujus medio ille' significatur Ecclesia ubi Verbum, ita omnes a quibus Verbum recipitur, nam alii non agnoscunt Divinum in illo; et ex significatione 
`videre opus Jehovae' quod sit agnoscere Divinum in eo.  Quod ita sit, patet, nam omnes qui intra Ecclesiam in bono vitae sunt agnoscunt Divinum in Verbo; causa est quia apud illos influit sanctum 
e caelo cum legunt Verbum, tametsi non sciunt quod id fiat mediis correspondentiis; quod etiam influit secundum correspondentias, nec percipitur aliter quam ut sanctum commune in quo tenetur mens; 
aliter apud illos qui non in bono vitae sunt; apud eos internum per quod {1}influit caelum, clausum est. @1 influxus est e coelo$ </p>
