<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6495节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6495.</strong>综上所述，可以看出，来自主的流注既直接从祂而来，也间接经由天堂而来。但从主而来的流注是天堂之爱、因而对邻之爱的良善。主就存在于这爱中，因为祂爱整个人类，渴望拯救每个人，直到永远。由于这爱的良善源于祂，所以祂自己就在这爱里面，由此与处于这爱之良善的人同在。但是，当人将自己置于接受地狱流注的状态时，他就会感觉爱自己爱世界的生活是快乐的，而爱邻的生活是不快乐的，除非这种生活对他自己有某种好处。由于处于这种状态的人只渴望邪恶，对于属灵生命只思想虚假，所以为防止他照他的渴望行事、照他的想法说话，便利用他自己的爱管束他，他害怕失去这些爱。因此，他因害怕失去地位、利益、名声和生命而受到约束。主流入这些构成最低层面的约束，利用它们掌管这个人。结果，此人在行为上看似文明、道德，有时看似一位天使；他于社会无害，也不伤害他的邻舍；即便他真的造成伤害，也会有世间法律来惩罚他。但在来世，这个层面不复存在；在那里，人身处灵界，因而身处其内层所在的气场。也就是说，他内在是什么样，他在那里就是什么样，而不是如他外在所表现的样子。因为外在从他那里被拿走了；一旦这些外在被拿走，他在世上的品质，无论是魔鬼的品质还是天使的品质，就显而易见了。</p>

From all that has been adduced it may be seen that the influx from the Lord is immediate, and also mediate through heaven; but the influx which is from the Lord is the good of heavenly love, thus of 
love toward the neighbor. In this love the Lord is present, for He loves the universal human race, and desires to eternally save every member of it; and as the good of this love is from Himself, He Himself 
is in it; thus He is present with the man who is in the good of this love. But when a man suffers himself to come into such a state as to receive influx from hell, he then feels the life of the 
love of self and of the world to be delightful, and the life of the love of the neighbor (unless it is in favor of himself) to be undelightful. And because a man who is in this state desires nothing but 
evils, and thinks nothing but falsities about the spiritual life, therefore to prevent his acting as he desires, and speaking as he thinks, he is kept in bonds by his loves themselves, whose loss he 
fears, thus by the fear of the loss of honor, gain, reputation, and life. Into these bonds which constitute the lowest plane, the Lord then flows, and through them rules the man; and hence he appears 
moral and civil in act, sometimes like an angel, and does no harm to society and his neighbor; and if he does harm, there are civil laws to punish him. But in the other life this plane is nonexistent; 
there man is in the spiritual world, consequently in the sphere of his interiors; thus such as he had been inwardly, such he is there, and not such as he had appeared in externals; for externals are 
taken away from him, and when these are taken away, his quality in the world, whether that of a devil or that of an angel, is manifest. </p>

From what has been mentioned so far it may be seen that influx from the Lord comes directly from Him and also indirectly by Way of heaven. But what flows in from the Lord is the good of heavenly love, 
thus of love towards the neighbour. Within this love the Lord is present, for He loves the entire human race and wishes to save each one for ever. And because the good of that love originates in Him, 
He Himself is within it and so is present with a person who has the good of that love within him. But when a person places himself in the state in which he accepts the inflow of hell, the life of self-love 
and love of the world feels delightful to him, and the life of love of the neighbour, unless there is something in it for himself, feels undelightful now because a person whose state is such has 
none but evil desires, and none but false ideas about spiritual life, to prevent him from acting in the same way as he desires and from speaking as he thinks, he is kept in check by means of his own 
loves, which he fears to lose. Thus he is restrained by means of his fears that he may lose position, gain, reputation, and life. The Lord flows into these restraints, which provide him with a field 
of activity on the last and lowest level, and He uses them to govern that person. The outcome of this is that the person appears in his actions to be well behaved and public-spirited, sometimes seeming 
to be like an angel. He does no harm to society or his neighbour; and should he do harm, there are civil laws to punish him. But that field of activity does not exist in the next life. A person there 
is in the spiritual world, consequently in the sphere where his interiors reside. That is to say, he is the same kind of person there as he had previously been inwardly, not as he had appeared to be 
outwardly. For outward forms and appearances are taken away from him; and once these have been taken away, it can be seen whether in the world he had been like a devil or like an angel. </p>

</p><b>6495.</b>
Ex his quae hactenus allata sunt, constare potest quod influxus a Domino sit immediatus, et quoque per caelum mediatus; sed influxus qui a Domino, est bonum amoris caelestis, ita amoris erga proximum; 
in hoc amore est Dominus praesens, nam amat universum genus humanum et singulos vult salvare in aeternum; (m){1}et quia bonum illius amoris est ab Ipso {2} est Ipse in illo, ita apud hominem praesens 
qui in illius amoris bono est.(n)  At cum homo (t)in illum statum se mittit ut recipiat influxum ab inferno, tunc vitam amoris sui et mundi sentit jucundam, et vitam amoris proximi, nisi sit pro se, 
injucundam.  Et quia homo {3}qui in {4}hoc statu est, non cupit nisi quam mala, et cogitat non nisi quam falsa de vita spirituali, ne itaque similiter agat sicut cupit, et loquatur sicut cogitat, tenetur 
in vinculis per ipsos suos amores, quorum privationem timet, ita per timores jacturae honoris, lucri, (x)famae, vitae; in haec vincula, quae faciunt planum ultimum, influit tunc Dominus et per illa 
regit eum; inde actualiter moratus et civilis apparet, quandoque sicut angelus, nec societati ac proximo damnum infert; et si inferret, sunt leges civiles quae puniunt.  Sed hoc planum nihil est in 
altera vita; homo ibi est in spirituali mundo, proinde in sphaera interiorum suorum, nempe qualis intus fuerat, talis ibi est, non qualis apparuit in externis; externa enim ei auferuntur, quibus ablatis 
patet qualis vel diabolus, vel qualis angelus fuerat in mundo. @1 quare$ @2 i proinde$ @3 cum$ @4 tali$ </p>
