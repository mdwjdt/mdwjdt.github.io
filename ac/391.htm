<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第391节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>391.</strong>在灵界，恶灵的状态清清楚楚表明，处于恶与假者害怕每一个人。丧失一切仁者到处游荡，四处逃亡。无论到哪里，譬如进入某个社群，在他们靠近的那一刻，社群里的人立马就觉察出他们的秉性，因为灵界的觉察力具有这种性质。这些社群成员不仅赶走那些入侵者，还狠狠地惩罚他们，实际上，如有可能，甚至图谋杀害他们。恶灵以彼此惩罚和折磨为最大乐趣，这是他们最大的满足。直到现在人们都不知道，恶与假本身就是这一切的起因，因为凡人想要加给别人的，都会报应给自己。虚假本身自带虚假的惩罚，邪恶本身自带邪恶的惩罚，因而它们自身就有对这些惩罚的恐惧。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]391.</strong> The best evidence that those under the sway of falsity and evil are afraid of everyone is provided by evil spirits in the other life. The ones who have deprived themselves of all charity wander and flee. Everywhere they go, whatever communities they may happen upon perceive immediately, on their first approach, what kind of person each of them is. (That kind of perception is possible in the other life.) These communities not only drive such spirits off but also punish them severely and in fact would like to kill them, if they could.<br />The evil take enormous delight in punishing and torturing each other; in this their greatest joy consists. And to reveal a secret, falsity and evil themselves lie at the root, since what one person desires to do to another returns on that person's own head. Falsity and evil carry with them their own punishment and so also the fear of punishment. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 391</b></p><p><b>391.</b>
The state of evil spirits in the other life shows most clearly that those who are in evil and falsity are afraid of everybody. Those who have deprived themselves of all charity wander about, and flee 
from place to place. Wherever they go, if to any societies, these at once perceive their character by their mere coming, for such is the perception that exists in the other life; and they not only drive 
them away, but also severely punish them, and with such animosity that they would kill them if they could. Evil spirits take the greatest delight in punishing and tormenting one another; it is their 
highest gratification. Not until now has it been known that evil and falsity themselves are the cause of this, for whatever anyone desires for another returns upon himself. Falsity has in itself the 
penalty of falsity, and evil has in itself the penalty of evil, and consequently they have in themselves the fear of these penalties. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 391</b></p><p><b>391.</b>
The fact that people under the influence of falsity and evil are afraid of everybody else can be recognized best of all from evil spirits in the next life. Those who have divested themselves of all charity 
are wanderers and fugitives. If, wherever they go, they come to any communities, the people there perceive their character the moment they are approaching. The perceptivity existing in the next 
life is such that these communities not only drive those intruders away, but also punish them severely. Indeed their intention is to kill them if possible. So very great is the pleasure which the evil 
find in punishing and torturing one another that their greatest delight consists in doing so. And what is an arcanum still, the cause lies in falsity and evil themselves, for what anyone wishes upon 
another recoils upon himself. In fact falsity and evil carry within themselves the punishment of falsity and evil, and consequently the fear of punishment.  </p>

</p><b>391.</b>
Quod qui in falso et malo sunt, timeant omnes, sciri optime potest a malis spiritibus in altera vita; qui privarunt se omni charitate, vagantur et fugiunt; quocumque veniunt, si ad aliquas societates, 
hae ilico percipiunt ex primo adventu qualis est {1}; talis perceptio datur in altera vita, eos non solum abigunt sed etiam graviter puniunt, immo eo usque ut animo sint occidere si possibile: delectantur 
quam maxime mali punire et cruciare unus alterum, in eo jucunditas eorum summa consistit. Et quod arcanum adhuc est, ipsum falsum et malum est in causa, nam quod quis cupit alteri, redit in ipsum, 
falsum enim et malum in se habet poenam falsi et mali, proinde timorem poenae. @	1 perhaps quales sunt.$ </p>
