<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6365节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6365.</strong>“你手必掐在仇敌的颈项上”表地狱和魔鬼团伙必从他面前逃离。这从“仇敌”和“掐在他们颈项的手”的含义清楚可知：“仇敌”是指地狱和魔鬼团伙，因为他们就是灵义上所指的仇敌；“掐在他们颈项的手”是指对那些逃跑之人的追捕，因为当一个敌人逃跑时，胜利者的手就掐在他的脖子上。之所以说“他们必从他面前逃离”，是因为当地狱团伙中有成员靠近主的属天国度的任意一位天使时，他就会从这天使面前逃跑，因为他承受不住。他之所以承受不住，是因为他无法承受属天之爱的气场，也就是对主之爱的气场。对他来说，该气场就像一团灼烧而又折磨人的烈火。此外，属天天使从不逃离；他的手更不会掐在仇敌的脖子上；事实上，就他而言，他没有仇敌，或说不将任何人看成仇敌。然而，之所以说他的手掐在他们的颈项上，是因为这是世上的事发生的方式；但真正的意思是，来自地狱的人视他们自己为他的仇敌，并从他面前逃离。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6365</b></p><p><b>6365.</b>
Thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies. That this signifies that the infernal and diabolical crew will flee at his presence, is evident from the signification of "enemies," as being the infernal 
and diabolical crew, for these are enemies in the spiritual sense; and from the signification of the "hand in their neck," as being to pursue those who are in flight; for when an enemy flees, the 
hand of the conqueror is in his neck. It is said that they shall flee at his presence, because when any one of the infernal crew approaches any angel of the Lord's celestial kingdom, he flees at his presence, 
being unable to endure it, because he cannot endure the sphere of celestial love, which is that of love to the Lord; this sphere being to him like burning and tormenting fire. Moreover a celestial 
angel never fights, still less is his hand in the neck of his enemies, nor indeed does he regard anyone as an enemy insofar as he is concerned; yet it is so expressed on account of the conditions 
in this world; but the real meaning is that the infernals, regarding themselves as his enemies, flee from his presence. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6365</b></p><p><b>6365.</b>
'Your hand will be on the neck of your enemies' means that the hellish and devilish crew will flee from its presence. This is clear from the meaning of 'enemies' as the hellish and devilish crew, for 
they are the enemies that are meant in the spiritual sense; and from the meaning of 'hand on their neck' as the pursuit of those who have taken to flight; for when an enemy flees the victor's hand is 
on his neck. The phrase 'will flee from its presence' is used because whenever a member of the hellish crew approaches an angel from the Lord's celestial kingdom he flees from his presence. He cannot 
stand it, because he cannot stand the sphere of celestial love, which is one of love to the Lord. To him that sphere is like a scorching and torturing fire. Furthermore no celestial angel ever engages 
in battle; still less does he have his hand on the neck of his enemies, indeed for his part he has no enemy. Nevertheless it says his hand will be on their neck because that is the way things go on 
in the world; but the meaning is that those from hell, who for their part are enemies, flee from his presence. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 6365</b>
</p><b>6365.</b>
`Manus tua in cervice hostium, tuorum':  quod significet quod infernalis et diabolica turba ad praesentiam aufugient, constat ex significatione `hostium' quod sit infernalis et diabolica turba, hi enim 
hostes sunt in spirituali sensu; et ex significatione `manus in cervice eorum' quod sit {1}persequi illos qui in fuga sunt, nam cum hostis fugit, est `manus victoris in cervice ejus'; quod dicatur 
quod `ad praesentiam aufugient', est quia cum aliquis ex turba infernali accedit ad aliquem angelum e regno caelesti Domini, ad praesentiam aufugiat, non enim sustinet illam, quia non sustinet sphaeram 
amoris caelestis, quae est amoris in Dominum; est illa sphaera ei sicut ignis urens et crucians.  (m)Praeterea angelus caelestis nusquam pugnat, minus est `manus ejus in cervice hostium {2}', immo 
nec aliquem a parte sui ut hostem habet, sed usque ita dicitur quia ita se habet in mundo; verum significatur quod infernales qui a parte sui hostes sunt, ad praesentiam aufugiant.(n) @1 in fuga esse$ @2 i ejus$ </p>
