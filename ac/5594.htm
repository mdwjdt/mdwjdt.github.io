<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5594节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5594.</strong>创世记43:6-10.以色列说，你们为什么这样害我，告诉那人你们还有个兄弟呢？他们说，那人详细问到我们和我们的出身，说，你们的父亲还活着吗？你们还有兄弟吗？我们就照着说这些话的口告诉他。焉能知道他要说，必须把你们的兄弟带下来呢？犹大又对他父亲以色列说，你打发童子与我同去，我们就起身去，好叫我们，就是我们和你，并我们的小孩子，都得存活，不至于死。我为他作保。你可以从我手中追讨他，我若不带他回来给你，把他交在你面前，我情愿终日是你的罪人。若不是我们耽搁，如今已经去回两次了。<br />“以色列说”表从属灵良善所得的觉知。“你们为什么这样害我，告诉那人你们还有个兄弟呢”表他们将良善之真理与属灵良善分离，以便将它与来自内在的属灵层联结。“他们说，那人详细问到我们”表对存在于属世层里面之物的清楚觉知。“和我们的出身”表对那里的信之真理。“说，你们的父亲还活着吗”表并对这些真理所源于的属灵良善。“你们还有兄弟吗”表对内层真理。“我们就照着说这些话的口告诉他”表它对这些事的一致看法。“焉能知道他要说，必须把你们的兄弟带下来呢”表我们不相信他想要那良善之真理与他联结。“犹大又对他父亲以色列说”表从教会的良善那里所得来的对于这些事的觉知。“你打发童子与我同去”表他要依附于他。“我们就起身去，好叫我们，都得存活，不至于死”表照着层级所进入的属灵生命。“就是我们”表教会的外在。“和你”表教会的内在。“并我们的小孩子”表甚至更内在的事物。“我为他作保”表在此期间，它（良善之真理）会依附于它（教会的良善）。“你可以从我手中追讨他”表只要在它的能力范围内，它就不会被夺走。“我若不带他回来给你，把他交在你面前”表除非它完整归还给教会。“我情愿终日是你的罪人”表教会的良善将不复存在。“若不是我们耽搁”表因犹豫不决的状态而拖延。“如今已经去回两次了”表属灵生命，无论外层还是内层，都早已得到恢复。</p>

Verses 6-10. And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye ill with me, to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother? And they said, Asking the man asked unto us, and unto our birth, saying is your father yet 
alive? Have ye a brother? And we told him according to the mouth of these words. Knowing could we know that he would say, Bring your brother down? And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the boy with 
me, and we will arise and go; and we will live, and not die, both we and thou, and also our little ones. I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him; if I bring him not unto thee, 
and set him before thee, and I shall sin to thee all the days; for except we had lingered, surely we had now returned these two times. "And Israel said," signifies perception from spiritual good; "Wherefore 
dealt ye ill with me to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?" signifies that they separated from them the truth of good, to conjoin it with the spiritual from the internal; "and they said, 
Asking the man asked unto us," signifies that it clearly perceived the things in the natural; "and unto our birth," signifies concerning the truths of faith there; "saying, is your father yet alive?" 
signifies and concerning the spiritual good from which they were; "have ye a brother?" signifies concerning interior truth; "and we told him according to the mouth of these words," signifies that he 
perceived them conformably; "knowing could we know that he would say, Bring your brother down?" signifies that we did not believe that he wished the truth of good to be conjoined with him; "and Judah 
said unto Israel his father," signifies perception from the good of the church concerning those things; "Send the boy with me," signifies that he should be adjoined to him; "and we will arise and go; 
and we will live, and not die," signifies spiritual life according to degrees; "both we," signifies the external of the church; "and thou," signifies its internal; "and also our little ones," signifies 
the things which are still more interior; "I will be surety for him," signifies that in the meantime it will be adjoined to itself; "of my hand shalt thou require him," signifies that it shall not 
be torn away insofar as lies in its power; "if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee," signifies unless he is quite restored to the church; "and I shall sin to thee all the days," signifies 
that the good of the church will no longer be; "for except we had lingered," signifies tarrying in a state of doubt; "surely we had now returned these two times," signifies that there would have been 
spiritual life both exterior and interior. </p>

Verses 6-10 And Israel said, Why did you treat me so badly as to tell the man that you had still [another] brother? And they said, The man questioned us closely about ourselves and our generation, saying, 
Is your father still alive? Have you a brother? And we told him according to the tenor<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of these words. Could we possibly have known that he would say, Cause your brother to come down? And Judah 
said to Israel his father, Send the boy with me, and we will rise up and go, and we will live and not die - even we, even you, even our young children. I myself will be surety for him; from my hand you 
will require him. If I do not bring him to you and set him before you, then I shall be sinning against you every day. For if perhaps we had not delayed we would by now have returned these two times.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> 
 </p>
<p>'And Israel said' means a perception received from spiritual good. 'Why did you treat me so badly as to tell the man that you had still [another] brother?' means that they separated the truth 
of good from spiritual good, so as to join it to the spiritual from the internal. 'And they said, The man questioned us closely about ourselves' means the clear perception this had regarding what existed 
within the natural. 'And our generation' means regarding the truths of faith there. 'Saying, Is your father still alive?' means and regarding spiritual good from which those truths sprang. 'Have you 
a brother?' means regarding interior truth. 'And we told him according to the tenor of these words' means its accordant discernment of these matters. 'Could we possibly have known that he would say, 
Cause your brother to come down?' means that we did not believe that he would want the truth of good to be joined to him. 'And Judah said to Israel his father' means a perception received from the good 
of the Church regarding these matters. 'Send the boy with me' means so that he would be attached to him. 'And we will rise up and go, and we will live and not die' means spiritual life entered into 
by degrees. 'Even we' means the external aspect of the Church. 'Even you' means the internal aspect of it. 'Even our young children' means aspects even more internal. 'And I will be surety for him' 
means that in the meantime [the truth of good] will be attached to it [the good of the Church]. 'From my hand you will require him' means that [the truth of good] will not be snatched away, insofar as 
it lies within its power to prevent it. 'If I do not bring him to you and set him before you' means the complete restoration of it to the Church. 'Then I shall be sinning against you every day' means 
that the good of the Church will not exist any longer. 'For if perhaps we had not delayed' means lingering in a state of indecision. 'We would by now have returned these two times' means that spiritual 
life, exterior and interior, [would have been restored].

Vers. 6-I0.  Et dixit Israel,  Quare male fecistis mihi, ad indicandum viro an adhuc vobis frater? Et dixerunt, Interrogando interrogavit vir ad nos, et ad nativitatem nostram, dicendo, An adhuc pater 
vester vivit? an sit vobis frater? et indicavimus ei juxta os verborum illorum; an sciendo scivimus quod diceret, Descendere facite fratrem vestrum? Et dixit Jehudah ad Israelem patrem suum, Mitte 
puerum mecum, et surgemus, et ibimus, et vivemus, et non moriemur, etiam nos, etiam tu, etiam infantes nostri. Ego spondebo pro illo, e manu mea quaeres illum, nisi adduxero illum ad te, et statuero illum 
coram te, et peccabo tibi omnibus diebus.  Quia ni forte tardaverimus, quod nunc reversi fuerimus his duabus vicibus. `Et dixit Israel' significat perceptionem ex bono spirituali: `Quare male fecistis 
mihi, ad indicandum viro, an adhuc {1} frater?' significat quod separarent a se {2}verum boni, ad conjungendum illud spirituali ab interno:  `et dixerunt, Interrogando interrogavit vir ad nos' significat 
quod clare perciperet quae in naturali: `et ad nativitatem nostram' significat de veris fidei ibi: `dicendo, An adhuc pater vester vivit?' significat et de bono spirituali a quo illa: `an sit 
(x)vobis frater?' significat de interiore vero: `et indicavimus  ei juxta os verborum illorum' significat quod apperciperet illa congrue: `an sciendo scivimus quod diceret, Descendere facite fratrem 
vestrum?' significat quod non credidimus quod vellet ut ipsi conjungeretur verum boni: `et dixit Jehudah ad Israelem patrem suum' significat perceptionem a bono Ecclesiae de illis: `Mitte puerum mecum' 
significat ut adjungeretur ei: `et surgemus, et ibimus, et vivemus, et non moriemur' significat vitam spiritualem secundum gradus: `etiam nos' significat externum Ecclesiae: `etiam tu' significat internum 
ejus: `etiam infantes nostri' significat quae adhuc interius: `{3}et' spondebo pro illo' significat quod adjungetur interea sibi: `e manu mea quaeres illum' significat quod non avelletur quantum 
in {4}sua potentia: `nisi adduxero illum ad te, et statuero illum coram te' significat nisi prorsus restitueretur Ecclesiae: `et peccabo tibi omnibus diebus' significat quod non bonum Ecclesiae erit 
amplius: `quia ni forte tardaverimus' significat immorationem in statu dubitationis: `quod nunc reversi fuerimus his duabus vicibus' significat quod vita spiritualis exterior et interior. @1 A I o
