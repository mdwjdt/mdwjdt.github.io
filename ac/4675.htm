<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4675节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4675.</strong>“以色列原来爱约瑟过于爱他的众子”表理性层的神性属灵层与属世层的神性属灵层的结合。这从“雅各”和“约瑟”的代表，以及“爱”的含义清楚可知：“雅各”被称为“以色列”时，是指属世层的神性属灵层，或来自属世层的属灵层的属天层（<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>，<a href="4598.htm">4598</a>节）；“约瑟”是指理性层的神性属灵层，或来自理性层的属灵层的属天层（<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>，<a href="4592.htm">4592</a>节）；“爱”是指结合，因为爱是属灵的结合。由此明显可知，“以色列爱约瑟”表示理性层的神性属灵层与属世层的神性属灵层的结合。由于论述的是这种结合，故雅各在此不像在第一和第二节那样叫“雅各”，而是叫“以色列”。从名字的这种变化可以断定，此处的内义含有某个特殊奥秘。至于理性层的神性属灵层与属世层的神性属灵层的结合是何性质，目前无法给予解释，因为这不是本章的主题，而是接下来几章的主题，在那里，这个奥秘将尽可能地得以解释。在此仅提及这一点：属灵层这个词既可用于理性层，也可用于属世层；因为属灵层是从主所接受的神性真理；当这神性真理在理性层或内在人里面闪耀时，它被称为理性层的属灵层；当从那里在属世层或外在人里面闪耀时，它被称为属世层的属灵层。</p>

Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons. That this signifies the conjunction of the Divine spiritual of the rational with the Divine spiritual of the natural, is evident from the representation 
of Jacob when called "Israel," as being the Divine spiritual of the natural, or the celestial of the spiritual from the natural (n. 4286, 4598); from the representation of Joseph, as being the Divine 
spiritual of the rational, or the celestial of the spiritual from the rational (n. 4286, 4592); and from the signification of "loving," as being to be conjoined, for love is spiritual conjunction. Hence 
it is evident that by Israel's loving Joseph is signified the conjunction of the Divine spiritual of the rational with the Divine spiritual of the natural. Because this conjunction is treated of, 
Jacob here is not called "Jacob," as in the first and second verses, but "Israel;" and from the changing of the name it may be inferred that some secret thing is contained here in the internal sense. 
But what is the nature of the conjunction of the Divine spiritual of the rational with the Divine spiritual of the natural cannot as yet be unfolded, because it is not treated of in this chapter, but 
in the chapters which follow, in which so far as possible this secret will be unfolded. This only is to be said here-that the spiritual is predicated both of the rational and of the natural; for the 
spiritual is the Divine truth which is from the Lord, and which when it shines in the rational or in the internal man, is called the spiritual of the rational; and when it shines thence in the natural 
or in the external man, is called the spiritual of the natural. </p>

'And Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons' means a joining of the Divine Spiritual of the Rational to the Divine Spiritual of the Natural. This is clear from the representation of Jacob, when he 
is called 'Israel', as the Divine Spiritual of the Natural, or the celestial manifestation of the spiritual from the natural, dealt with in <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>, <a href="4598.htm">4598</a>; from the representation of 'Joseph' as the Divine 
Spiritual of the Rational, or the celestial manifestation of the spiritual from the rational, dealt with in <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>, <a href="4592.htm">4592</a>; and from the meaning of 'loving' as being joined together, for love is a joining 
together spiritually. From all this it is evident that 'Israel loved Joseph' means a joining of the Divine Spiritual of the Rational to the Divine Spiritual of the Natural. That joining together 
being referred to here, Jacob is not called Jacob at this point, as he is above in verses 1 and <a href="2.htm">2</a>, but 'Israel'. From this change of name too one may conclude that the internal sense here contains a specific 
arcanum. But the exact nature of that joining together - of the Divine Spiritual of the Rational to the Divine Spiritual of the Natural - cannot as yet be explained because it is not the subject 
in the present chapter but in those that follow, where it is going to be explained as far as it is possible to do so. Only this need be mentioned here, that the expression spiritual is used both of 
the rational and of the natural, for the spiritual is Divine Truth received from the Lord, which is called the spiritual of the rational when it shines within the rational or the internal man, and the 
spiritual of the natural when it shines from there within the natural or the external man. </p>

`Et Israel amavit Josephum prae omnibus filiis suis': quod significet conjunctionem Divini Spiritualis Rationalis cum Divino Spirituali Naturalis, constat ex repraesentatione `Jacobi ut Israel' quod 
sit Divinum Spirituale Naturalis, seu caeleste spiritualis e naturali, de qua n. 4286, 4598; ex repraesentatione `Josephi' quod sit Divinum Spirituale Rationalis seu caeleste spiritualis e rationali, 
de qua n. 4286, 4592; et ex significatione `amare' quod sit conjungi, amor enim est conjunctio spiritualis; </p>
<p>inde patet quod per `Israel amavit Josephum' significetur conjunctio Divini Spiritualis 
Rationalis cum Divino Spirituali Naturalis; quia hic agitur de conjunctione illa, Jacob non hic vocatur `Jacob' ut in vers. 1 et 2 supra, sed `Israel'; etiam ex mutatione nominis concludi potest 
quod aliquid arcani sit quod in sensu interno hic continetur.  Sed quomodo se habet cum conjunctione illa, nempe Divini Spiritualis Rationalis cum Divino Spirituali Naturalis, nondum explicari 
potest quia de illa {1} non agitur in hoc capite, sed in (o)capitibus sequentibus, in quibus arcanum illud, quantum potest, explicandum venit; hic solum quod spirituale praedicetur et de rationali 
et de naturali, spirituale enim est Divinum Verum quod a Domino, quod cum lucet in rationali seu in interno homine, dicitur spirituale rationalis, et cum inde lucet in naturali seu in externo homine, 
dicitur spirituale naturalis.      @1 illo I$ </p>
