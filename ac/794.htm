<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>794.</strong>“水势在地上越来越大”表虚假的信念就像这样增长。这一点从刚才有关水的论述清楚可知，即“洪水”或“诸水的泛滥”表示虚假。此处由于虚假，或虚假的信念进一步增多，故经上说“水势在地上越来越大”，这在原始语言中是最高级。虚假是错误的原则和信念，它们在大洪水前的人当中激增，这一点从前面有关它们的阐述清楚看出来。当人们将真理浸没于恶欲，即用这些真理支持我欲和物欲时，信念就会激增。实际上，在这些情况下，他们滥用了这些真理，并千方百计迫使它们赞同。因为凡吸收或为自己构筑虚假原则者，谁不是通过他所知的大量事实，甚至通过圣言来确认它？有哪个异端不是以同样的方式紧紧抓住确认的观念，并迫使事物赞同，以种种方式解释、曲解它们，以便它们不再反对？<br />以吸收无需仁爱的善行，唯信得救原则之人为例。他岂不会通过圣言罗织一整套教义，却根本不关心，或不考虑，甚至不去留意主针对凭果子就能认出的树，不结好果子、被砍下来丢在火里的树说了些什么（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.16.htm">7:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.20.htm">20</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.33.htm">12:33</a>）？还有什么比顺从肉体生活，同时只凭着知道何为真理，却不行出善事就能得救更有吸引力的呢？人所培育的一切恶欲构成其意愿的生命，一切虚假原则或信念构成其觉知的生命。当真理或信之教义被浸没于恶欲时，其意愿的生命和其觉知的生命就合为一体。人皆以这种方式为自己可以说形成一个灵魂。死后，他的生命就会变成这样。因此，对于一个人来说，没有什么比知道何为真理更为重要的了。当他知道何为真理，并清楚到它无法被败坏的程度时，那它就不会被如此浸没于恶欲中，造成致命的后果。人的心里除了装着永生外，还要装什么呢？如果他在有生之年（肉身生活期间）摧毁了自己的灵魂，他岂不是永远毁灭了它？</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]794.</strong> And the water strengthened greatly, greatly on the earth means that persuasive lies piled up in this way, as is established by statements made and evidence offered just above concerning water. They showed that flood waters symbolize falsities. Because the falsity (or the false persuasions) intensified, the current verse says that the water strengthened greatly, greatly, this being a superlative in the original language.<br />By falsities I mean false premises and false persuasions. These increased tremendously among the pre-Flood people, as remarks above [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_794/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_560" target=_top>560</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_794/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_562" target=_top>562</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_794/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_581" target=_top>581</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_794/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_660" target=_top>660-661</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_794/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_705#subsection-2-3" target=_top>705:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_794/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_736" target=_top>736</a>] concerning them make clear.<br />Self-delusion grows tremendously when it taints truth with perverted desires, that is, when it uses truth to justify self-love and materialism. In doing so, it corrupts truth and forces it to cooperate in a thousand different ways. What person is there who has either absorbed or manufactured false principles, without using a plethora of facts at his or her disposal — even from the Word — to confirm them? Is there a heresy in existence that does not seize on this kind of support? And if heresy comes across arguments that do not harmonize, it compels them to yield anyway, explaining and distorting them in a variety of ways until they no longer disagree.<br />[2] Take those who embrace the premise that faith alone, without the good deeds of charity, brings salvation. Are they not capable of weaving together a whole system of theology out of the Word? And yet they do not care about, they do not pay attention to, they do not even see the Lord's words that a tree is recognized by its fruit and that a tree not bearing good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_794/bible_king-james-version_matthew_7_16-17" target=_top>Matthew 7:16-17</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_794/bible_king-james-version_matthew_7_18" target=_top>18</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_794/bible_king-james-version_matthew_7_19" target=_top>19</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_794/bible_king-james-version_matthew_7_20" target=_top>20</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_794/bible_king-james-version_matthew_12_33" target=_top>12:33</a>). What could be more pleasing than to live by the desires of our flesh and still be saved? To merely know what is true without doing a single scrap of good?<br />Every perverse yearning that we cultivate goes into making up the life of our will, and every falsity that we adopt as a premise or as a conviction goes into making up the life of our intellect. These two kinds of life combine into one when we merge the doctrinal teachings of faith with our cravings. By this means we each form a kind of personal soul, and the quality of its life remains unchanged after death. As a result, nothing is more important for us than to know what is true. When we know what is true — and know it in such a way that it cannot be perverted — it cannot be infused with corrupt desires and do deadly harm. What should we take more to heart than our eternal life? If we destroy our soul during bodily life, do we not destroy it forever?{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Possibly an echo of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_794/bible_king-james-version_matthew_10_28" target=_top>Matthew 10:28</a> ("Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul.

And the waters were strengthened very exceedingly upon the earth. That this signifies that persuasions of falsity thus increased, is evident from what has been said and shown just above about "waters" 
namely, that the waters of a flood, or inundations, signify falsities. Here, because falsities or persuasions of what was false were still more increased, it is said that the "waters were strengthened 
very exceedingly" which in the original language is the superlative. Falsities are principles and persuasions of what is false, and that these had increased immensely among the antediluvians, is evident 
from all that has been said before concerning them. Persuasions immensely increase when men mingle truths with cupidities, or make them favor the loves of self and of the world; for then in a thousand 
ways they pervert them and force them into agreement. For who that has imbibed or framed for himself a false principle does not confirm it by much that he has learned; and even from the Word? Is 
there any heresy that does not thus lay hold of things to confirm it? and even force, and in diverse ways explain and distort, things that are not in agreement, so that they may not disagree?  [2] 
For example, he who adopts the principle that faith alone is saving, without the goods of charity; can he not weave a whole system of doctrine out of the Word? and this without in the least caring for, 
or considering, or even seeing, what the Lord says, that "the tree is known by its fruit" and that "every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire"? (Matt. 3:10, 7:16-20, 
12:33). What is more pleasing than to live after the flesh, and yet be saved if only one knows what is true, though he does nothing of good? Every cupidity that a man favors forms the life of 
his will, and every principle or persuasion of falsity forms the life of his understanding. These lives make one when the truths or doctrinals of faith are immersed in cupidities. Every man thus forms 
for himself as it were a soul, and such after death does his life become. Nothing therefore is of more importance to a man than to know what is true. When he knows what is true, and knows it so well 
that it cannot be perverted, then it cannot be so much immersed in cupidities and have such deadly effect. What should a man have more at heart than his life to eternity? If in the life of the body he 
destroys his soul, does he not destroy it to eternity? </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 794</b></p><p><b>794.</b>
'And the waters grew stronger and stronger over the earth' means that persuasions of falsity increased in this way. This is clear from what has been stated and shown just above about waters, namely that 
'the waters of the flood' or inundations means falsities. Here since falsities, or persuasions of falsity, increased still more it is said that 'the waters grew stronger and stronger', which in the 
original language is the superlative degree. Falsities are false assumptions and persuasions of falsity, which increased enormously among the people before the Flood, as is clear from what has been 
stated concerning them already. Persuasions increase enormously when people immerse truths in evil desires, that is, make those truths support self-love and love of the world. Indeed in those circumstances 
they pervert those truths, and in a thousand ways force them to agree. For what person is there who, having adopted a false assumption, or made one for himself, does not confirm it from the many 
facts he knows, even indeed from the Word? Is there any heresy which does not in like manner take hold of confirmatory ideas, and which does not force things that do not agree, and in different ways 
explain and distort them so that they disagree no longer?  </p>

 Take for example someone who adopts the assumption that faith alone saves without the good works of charity. Can he not weave an entire 
system of doctrine from the Word and yet not care in the slightest, not even pay attention to, or indeed notice what the Lord has said about a tree being known by its fruit, and about the tree that 
does not bear good fruit being cut down and thrown into the fire, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%207:16-20;%2012:33?&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 7:16-20; 12:33?</a> What could be more appealing than living after the flesh and at the same time being saved by merely knowing what 
is true and not having to perform any good action at all? Every evil desire which a person fosters constitutes the life of his will, and every false assumption or persuasion constitutes the life of his 
understanding. The life of his will and that of his understanding make one when truths, or doctrinal matters concerning faith, are immersed in evil desires. Everybody in this way forms a soul for himself 
so to speak, and of such a nature does his life become after death. Consequently nothing is of greater importance to man than knowing what the truth is. When he knows what the truth is, and knows 
it so well that it cannot be perverted, it cannot then be steeped in evil desires and have deadly effect. What more ought anyone to have at heart than his life which lasts for ever? If he destroys 
his soul during his lifetime, does he not destroy it for ever? </p>

'Et aquae corroboratae valde valde super terra': quod significent persuasiones falsi quod ita accreverint, constat ex illis quae mox prius de aquis dicta et ostensa sunt, quod nempe 'aquae diluvii seu 
inundantes' significent falsa; hic quia adhuc magis falsa seu persuasiones falsi, dicitur quod 'corroboratae sint aquae valde valde,' quod est superlativum linguae originalis. Falsa sunt principia 
falsi et persuasiones falsi, quae quod apud antediluvianos accreverint immensum, ab illis quae prius dicta sunt de iis, constat.  Persuasiones immensum crescunt, cum vera infundunt cupiditatibus, seu 
faciunt ut amoribus sui et mundi faveant, tunc enim pervertunt illa, et cogunt mille modis in consensum: quis enim est qui principium falsi hausit, aut sibi finxit, qui non confirmat id ex multo scientifico 
apud eum, immo etiam ex Verbo? an ulla haeresis est quae non confirmantia sic capit, et quae non consentiunt, usque cogit, ac diversimode explicat et detorquet ut non dissentiant? [2] Sicut qui 
capit principium, quod sola fides salvet absque bonis charitatis, annon integrum' systema doctrinae ex Verbo contexere queat? et tamen ne hilum curat, ne quidem attendit, immo nec videt, quod Dominus 
dixit, 	Quod arbor cognoscatur ex fructu,... et quae arbor non bonum fructum fert, exscindetur et projicietur in ignem, Matth. vii 16-20; xii 33. Quid magis placet quam vivere secundum carnem, et usque 
salvari, modo sciat quid verum, tametsi ne hilum boni agat?  Omnis cupiditas, cui homo favet, vitam ejus voluntatis facit; et omne principium, seu omnis persuasio falsi, vitam ejus intellectus facit; 
hae vitae unam faciunt, cum vera seu doctrinalia fidei immergunt cupiditatibus; quisque homo ita quasi animam sibi format, cujus vita fit talis post mortem; quare nihil plus interest homini quam 
scire quid verum; cum scit quid verum, et quidem ita ut non perverti possit, tunc non ita infundi potest cupiditatibus et mortiferum facere.  Quid plus homini cordi esse debet quam vita ejus in aeternum? 
 Si animam suam in vita corporis destruit, anne eam in aeternum? </p>
