<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第624节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>624.</strong>此处所论述的状态并非教会的状态，这一点从以下事实清楚可知：在这一节及接下来的章节，经文用的是“神”这个名，而前面章节用的是“耶和华”。当教会不存在时，就用“神”这个名，而当教会存在时，就用“耶和华”。如创世记第一节，当教会不存在时，祂被称为“神”，而在下一章，当教会存在时，祂被称为“耶和华神”。“耶和华”是最神圣的名，唯独属于教会。“神”并非如此神圣，因为没有哪个民族没有神。因此，“神”这个名并不那么神圣，人不可说出“耶和华”之名，除非他拥有真正的信仰认知。但谁都可以说出神之名。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]624.</strong> The current passage is about circumstances in which there is no church, as can be seen from the fact that from here on the present chapter speaks of God, whereas in the first part it spoke of Jehovah. When no church exists, the text uses the name God, but when a church does exist, it uses Jehovah. In <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_624/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_1-31" target=_top>Genesis 1</a>, for instance, where there was no church, it said God, but later, when a church did exist, it said Jehovah God.<br />Jehovah is an extremely sacred name used nowhere else but in the church. This is not true of God, however, since every nation had its gods, and so the name God is not as sacred. No one was allowed to mention Jehovah without a knowledge of the true faith; but anyone could speak of God.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the sanctity of the name Jehovah, see note 3 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_624/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_16" target=_top>16</a>.

That a state not of the church is here treated of, is evident from the fact that here and in the following verses of this chapter the name "God" is used, but in preceding verses "Jehovah." When there 
is not a church "God" is the term used, and when there is a church "Jehovah;" as in the first chapter of Genesis, when there was no church, it is said "God;" but in the second chapter, when there was 
a church, it is said "Jehovah God." The name "Jehovah" is most holy, and belongs only to the church; but the name "God" is not so holy, for there was no nation that had not gods, and therefore the name 
God was not so holy. No one was permitted to speak the name "Jehovah" unless he had knowledge [cognitio] of the true faith; but anyone might speak the name "God." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 624</b></p><p><b>624.</b>
It is clear that a state which is not a state of the Church is the subject here from the fact that in this verse and those that follow in chapter the name God is used, whereas in previous verses it was 
Jehovah. When the Church does not exist the name God is used, but when it does exist, it is Jehovah; for example in Genesis <a href="1.htm">1</a>, when the Church did not exist, He was called God, but in the next chapter 
when it did, He was called Jehovah God. 'Jehovah' is the holiest of names, and belongs to the Church alone. Not so 'God', for no nation was without gods. Consequently the same holiness was not attached 
to the name God. Nobody was allowed to utter the name Jehovah except him who had knowledge of the true faith; but anyone was allowed to utter the name God. </p>

</p><b>624.</b>
Quod hic de statu non Ecclesiae agatur, constat inde quod hic et in sequentibus hujus capitis dicatur 'Deus,' in praecedentibus autem 'Jehovah'; quando non Ecclesia, dicitur Deus, at quando Ecclesia, 
dicitur Jehovah, sicut in capite, primo Geneseos quando non Ecclesia, dictam est Deus, in sequente autem quando Ecclesia, dictum Jehovah Deus: Jehovah est sanctissimum, et non nisi quam Ecclesiae; at 
Deus non ita, 'quia nulla non gens habuit deos, quare nomen Deus non ita sanctum: nemini Jehovam nominare licuit, nisi cui verae fidei cognitio, at Deum cuicumque. </p>
