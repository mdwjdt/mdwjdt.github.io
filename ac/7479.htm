<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7479节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7479.</strong>我曾与来自这个星球的一些灵人谈论住在那里的人的信仰。他们说，那里的人认为，除了污秽和地狱之物外，他们里面什么也没有，一切良善皆属于主。他们甚至进一步说，他们凭自己就是魔鬼，主把他们从地狱拉出来，不断拦阻他们。他们很惊讶我周围竟有这么多恶灵，并且这些恶灵还与我交谈。但我得以回答说，他们获得这种许可，是为了让我能由此了解他们的性质，以及他们为何陷入地狱；这种命运是由于他们所过的生活。我还得以说，这些恶灵当中有许多活在世上时，我就认识他们；他们在世时曾身居高位，但他们心里除了世界以外什么也没有。不过，我补充说，没有一个恶灵，哪怕最属地狱的恶灵能伤我分毫，因为主不断保护我。</p>

I have spoken with some from that earth about the faith of those who dwell there. They said that they there believe that there is nothing in them but what is filthy and infernal, and that all good is 
of the Lord. They even said further that of themselves they are devils, and that the Lord draws them out and continually withholds them from hell. They wondered that so many evil spirits were about me, 
and also spoke to me; but it was given me to answer that this is permitted them for the purpose that I may thus know their quality, and why they are in hell, and that this is according to their life. 
It was also given me to say that there were some among them whom I had known when they lived in the world, and that they had then been in stations of great dignity, although nothing but the world was 
in their hearts; but that no evil spirit, even the most infernal, can do me any harm, because I am continually protected by the Lord. </p>

I have talked to some from that planet about what people there believe. They said that people there believe that they have nothing within themselves except what is filthy and from hell, and that anything 
good is the Lord's. Indeed they went further than that, saying that left to themselves they are devils but that the Lord pulls them out of hell and constantly holds them back from it. They were astonished 
that I had so many evil spirits around me and also that these talked to me. But I was led to reply that they were allowed to be there in order that I might get to know what they were like and 
why they were in hell, and to know that their character and lot was due to the life they lived. I was also led to say that a number of these evil spirits were people whom I had been acquainted with 
when they lived in the world, during which time they had been appointed to high office yet had set their hearts on the world and nothing else. But, I added, no evil spirit, not even the most hellish, 
could ever do me harm since I was under the Lord's constant protection. </p>

Locutus sum cum aliquibus {1}ex illa tellure de fide illorum ibi; dicebant quod ibi credant quod apud illos nihil nisi quam spurcum et infernale sit, et quod omne bonum sit Domini; immo dicebant amplius 
quod ex se sint diaboli, et quod Dominus ab inferno illos extrahat, et continue {2}detineat.  Mirati sunt quod circum me essent tot mali spiritus, et quod illi ad me quoque loquerentur; sed respondere 
datum est quod hoc illis permittatur, ob causam ut inde {1}sciam quales sunt, et cur in inferno sunt, et quod hoc sit secundum vitam (c)illorum; etiam dicere datum est quod plures inter illos essent 
quos cognoveram (d)cum vixerunt in mundo, et quod tunc in magna (x)dignitate constituti {2}fuerint, quibus tunc nihil nisi quam mundus cordi fuit; sed quod nusquam aliquis malus spiritus, etiam maxime 
infernalis, mihi damnum inferre possit, quia continue tutatus a Domino. 	@1 scirem$ 	@2 sint$ </p>
