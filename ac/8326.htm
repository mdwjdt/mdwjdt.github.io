<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8326节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8326.</strong>”栽植他们”表不断重生。这从“栽植”的含义清楚可知，“栽植”是指重生，因为重生就像栽植。当一棵树被栽植时，它长出枝叶和果实，然后通过果实的种子又长出新树，以此类推。一个人的重生也是类似的情形，这也解释了为何在圣言中，一个人还被比作一棵树，一个重生之人被比作一个花园或乐园；这人所具有的信之真理被比作叶子，仁之良善被比作果实；长出新树的种子对应于源于良善的真理，或也可说，对应于源于仁之信。之所以说“不断重生”，是因为一个人的重生虽有一个开始，却永不停止；他不断变得更完美，不仅在活在世上时如此，而且在来世，直到永远都是如此。然而，他永远不可能达到任何一种能使他与神性相比的完美。</p>

And plant them. That this signifies regeneration continually, is evident from the signification of "planting," as being to regenerate, for regeneration is circumstanced like planting. For when a tree 
is planted, it grows into branches, leaves, and fruits, and from the seeds of the fruits it grows into new trees; and so on. Similar is the case with regeneration in man, and therefore in the Word a 
man is also compared to a tree, and a regenerate man to a garden or paradise; the truths of faith with him are compared to the leaves, and the goods of charity to the fruits, the seeds from which come 
new trees to the truths which are from good, or what is the same, to the faith which is from charity. It is said "regeneration continually," because regeneration begins in a man, but never ceases, being 
continually perfected, not only while he lives in the world, but also in the other life to eternity; and yet it can never arrive at any such perfection that it can be compared to the Divine. </p>

'And plant them' means regeneration going on continuously. This is clear from the meaning of 'planting' as regenerating, for regeneration is like the activity of planting. When a tree is planted it grows 
into branches, leaves, and fruit, then from seeds in the fruit it grows into new trees, and so on. A person's regeneration is similar, which also explains why in the Word a person is compared to 
a tree, and one who has been regenerated to a garden or paradise. The truths of faith with that person are compared to the leaves, and forms of the good of charity to the fruit; the seeds from which new 
trees grow correspond to truths which spring from good, or what amounts to the same thing, to faith which springs from charity. The expression 'regeneration going on continuously' is used because a 
person's regeneration has a beginning but never ceases; he is continually being made more perfect not only while he lives in the world but also in the next life for evermore. Yet he can never reach any 
kind of perfection that enables him to be compared with the Divine. </p>

</p><b>8326.</b>
`Et plantabis illos': quod significet regenerationem continue, constat ex significatione `plantare' quod sit regenerare, nam regeneratio se habet sicut plantatio; arbor enim cum plantatur, crescit in 
ramos, folia, et fructus, et ex seminibus fructuum crescit in novas arbores {1}, et sic porro; similiter se habet cum regeneratione apud hominem, quare etiam homo in Verbo comparatur arbori, et regeneratus 
homo horto aut paradiso; vera fidei apud illum comparantur foliis, et bona charitatis fructibus, semina a quibus novae arbores veris quae ex bono, seu quod idem, fidei quae ex charitate.  Regeneratio 
continue dicitur quia regeneratio apud hominem incohat sed nusquam desinit; {2} perficitur continue non modo cum vivit in mundo sed etiam in altera vita in aeternum; et tamen nusquam ad aliquam 
talem perfectionem pervenire potest ut possit cum Divino comparari. 	@1 i similes$ 	@2 i homo$ </p>
