<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10648节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10648</strong>.“百姓随从他们的神，就行淫”表邪恶的虚假由此产生。这从“随从列族的神，就行淫”的含义清楚可知，“随从列族的神，就行淫”是指与邪恶的虚假结合，因为“行淫”表示非法结合，“列族的神”表示邪恶的虚假。“神”表示虚假（<a href="4402.htm">4402</a>e，<a href="4544.htm">4544</a>，<a href="7873.htm">7873</a>，<a href="8867.htm">8867</a>节），“列族”表示邪恶（<a href="10638.htm">10638</a>节）。之所以说“邪恶的虚假由此产生”，是因为一切虚假都是从邪恶涌出来的。然而，并非由邪恶产生的虚假在外在形式上确实是虚假，但在内在形式上却不是。因为虚假可以与过着良善生活的人同在；但这些虚假里面有良善，这就使得虚假的邪恶被移除。因此，这种虚假在天使面前不显为虚假，而是显为一种真理；因为天使们看的是信的内层，而不是它的外层。这就是为何所有人，无论其宗教信仰如何，即便是没有来自圣言的真理的外邦人，只要他们以过良善的生活为自己的目的，将他们所接受的宗教教义视为达到这个目的的手段，就都能得救（参看<a href="2589.htm">2589</a>-<a href="2604.htm">2604</a>节）。<br />在圣言中，经上经常提到“行淫，或行淫”。这个词表示与真理的一种非法结合；“通奸”表示与良善的一种非法结合；因此，“行淫”表示对真理的歪曲，“通奸”表示对良善的玷污。对真理的歪曲以下面三种方式发生：⑴一个人过着邪恶的生活，却又承认教义的真理；因为在这种情况下，邪恶就在真理里面，邪恶歪曲真理，因为邪恶从真理中驱散天上和神性之物，并植入地狱之物，由此产生歪曲。<br />⑵一个人一开始接受教义上的真理，后来又同意另一套教义的虚假；这种情况只发生在那些过着邪恶生活的人身上，因为邪恶渴望并寻求虚假，急于抓住它当作真理。⑶如果一个在生活上陷入邪恶，在教义陷入虚假的人抓住属于另一套教义的真理，那么他也会歪曲真理，因为他承认真理不是为了真理本身的缘故，只是为了某种利益、重要地位或名声而承认它们。<br />在圣言中，所有这些歪曲都被称为“淫行”和“淫乱”，因为“婚姻”表示一种合法的结合，也就是良善和真理的结合（参看<a href="2727.htm">2727</a>-<a href="2759.htm">2759</a>节）；因此，“淫行”表示一种非法的结合。事实就是这样，这一点从圣言中的许多经文可以看出来，我在此仅从中引用这两段，以西结书：<br />耶路撒冷啊，你因你的名声就行淫，向任何过路人倾泻出你的淫行。你拿了你的一些衣服，为自己在高处结彩，又在那上头行淫。你又将我所给你那华美的金银器皿为自己制造男性的像，与它们行淫。你将给我所生的儿女祭献给它们。你的淫行岂是小事？你和你那肉体肥大的邻居埃及人行淫，加增你的淫乱，惹我发怒。你与亚述人行淫，与他们行淫之后，仍不满足。于是你增多你的淫乱，直到那迦勒底的贸易之地。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.15.htm">16:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.17.htm">17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.20.htm">20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.26.htm">26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.28.htm">28</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.29.htm">29</a>ff）<br />同一先知书：<br />有两个女子，是一母所生的女儿，在埃及行淫，在年少时就行淫。阿荷拉就是撒马利亚，阿荷利巴就是耶路撒冷。阿荷拉在我之下行淫，恋慕她的爱人，就是她的邻邦亚述人。她在他们身上放纵淫行。她的淫行从埃及时她就没有撇弃。因为她年幼时，他们和她同寝。阿荷利巴闹恋爱比她更甚，加增淫行在她姐姐的淫行之上；她恋慕亚述人，她添加淫行，看见迦勒底人的像。她的眼目一看见他们，就恋慕他们。巴比伦人就来到她那里，上了她爱情的床。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.2.htm">23:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.17.htm">17</a>）<br />也可参看其它许多经文，它们连同对它们以及上述两段经文的解释可参看前文（<a href="2466.htm">2466</a>，<a href="8904.htm">8904</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 10648</b></p><p><b>10648.</b>
And they commit whoredom after their gods. That this signifies the consequent falsities of evil, is evident from the signification of "committing whoredom after the gods of the nations," as being to 
be conjoined with falsities of evil, for by "committing whoredom" is signified to be unlawfully conjoined; and by "the gods of the nations" are signified the falsities of evil. (That "gods" denote falsities, 
see at n. 4402, 4544, 7873, 8867; and that "nations" denote evils, n. 10638.) It is said "the consequent" falsities of evil, because all falsities come forth from evil. The falsities which are 
not from evil are indeed falsities in the external form, but not in the internal form. For there are falsities with those who are in the good of life, but within these falsities there is good, which 
causes the evil of the falsity to be removed; consequently before the angels this falsity does not appear as falsity, but as a species of truth; for the angels look at the interiors of faith, and not 
at its exteriors. From this it is that everyone can be saved, from every religion whatever, and even the Gentiles who have no truths from the Word, provided they have regarded as their end the good of 
life (see n. 2589-2604). [2] In the Word frequent mention is made of "committing whoredom," and thereby is signified an unlawful conjunction with truth; and by "committing adultery" is signified an 
unlawful conjunction with good. Consequently by "committing whoredom" is signified the falsification of truth; and by "committing adultery," the adulteration of good. The falsification of truth is done 
in three ways. First: if a man is in evil of life and acknowledges the truths of doctrine; for in this case evil is within the truths, and evil falsifies truth, because evil disperses what is heavenly 
and Divine out of the truths, and implants what is infernal; from which comes the falsification. [3] Second: if a man is at first in truths as to doctrine, and afterward accedes to the falsity of 
some other doctrine; which takes place with those only who are in evil of life; for evil seeks falsity, and eagerly seizes on it as truth. Third: if a man who is in evil as to life and in falsities as 
to doctrine seizes on the truths of some other doctrine, he also falsifies truths, because he does not acknowledge the truths for their own sake; but for the sake of something of gain, honor, or reputation. 
 [4] All these falsifications are called in the Word "whoredoms" and "harlotries," for the reason that by "marriage" is meant a lawful conjunction, which is that of good and truth (see n. 2727-2759). 
Consequently unlawful conjunctions are meant by "whoredoms." That this is so can be seen from many passages in the Word, of which I will here adduce only these two: </p>
<p>     Jerusalem, thou didst 
commit whoredom because of thy name, and pouredst out thy whoredoms on everyone that passed by. Thou didst take of thy garments, and madest for thee high places of divers colors, and didst commit whoredom 
upon them. Thou didst take the vessels of thine adornment of My gold and of My silver, which I had given thee, and madest for thee images of a male, and didst commit whoredom with them. Thou hast 
taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto Me; and these hast thou sacrificed unto them. Is this a little thing of thy whoredoms? Thou hast committed whoredom with the sons of Egypt, 
thy neighbors, great of flesh; and hast multiplied thy whoredom to provoke Me. Thou hast committed whoredom with the sons of Asshur, and hast committed whoredom with them and wast not sated; and thou 
hast multiplied thy whoredom unto the land of traffic, unto, Chaldea (Ezek. 16:15-17, 20, 26, 28, 29, and following verses).      Two women, the daughters of one mother, committed whoredom in Egypt; 
they committed whoredom in their youth. Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem. Oholah committed whoredom under Me, and she doted on her lovers, the Assyrians her neighbors. She bestowed her 
whoredoms upon them, she forsook not her whoredoms from Egypt, for they lay with her in her youth. Oholibah was more corrupt in her love than she, and multiplied her whoredoms above the whoredoms of her 
sister; she doted upon the sons of Asshur, she added to her whoredoms, and saw the images of the Chaldeans, she doted upon them with the look of her eyes; the sons of Babel came to her for the lying 
together of loves (Ezek. 23:2-17). See also in many other passages, which may be seen explained along with these in n. 2466, 8904. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10648</b></p><p><b>10648.</b>
'And they go whoring after their gods' means from which falsities of evil arise. This is clear from the meaning of 'whoring after the gods of the nations' as being linked to falsities of evil; for being 
linked together unlawfully is meant by 'whoring', and falsities of evil by 'the gods of the nations'. For the meaning of 'gods' as falsities', see <a href="4402.htm">4402</a>(end), <a href="4544.htm">4544</a>, <a href="7873.htm">7873</a>, <a href="8867.htm">8867</a>, and for that of 'nations' 
as evils, above in <a href="10638.htm">10638</a>. The expression 'from which falsities of evil arise' is used because from evil all kinds of falsity come forth. Falsities however which do not arise from evil are indeed 
falsities in the outward form they take, but they are not inwardly so. For falsities can exist with someone who leads a good life; but they have good interiorly present in them which causes the evil 
of the falsity to be removed. Consequently that falsity does not appear before angels as falsity but as a sort of truth; for angels look at the inner features of faith, not the outward aspects of it. 
This is why everyone, whatever their religion, even gentiles who possess no truths from the Word, can be saved, provided that they have regarded leading a good life as their end in view, and the religious 
teachings they have received as the means to that end, see <a href="2589.htm">2589</a>-<a href="2604.htm">2604</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 'Whoring' is spoken of frequently in the Word. An unlawful joining to truth is meant by this, and an unlawful joining 
to good by 'committing adultery', so that 'whoring' means the falsification of truth, and 'committing adultery' the adulteration of good. The falsification of truth takes place in the following three 
ways,  <a href="1.htm">1</a> If a person leads an evil life while acknowledging truths received through religious teachings, for the truths then have evil inside them, and evil falsifies truth. It does so because evil 
dispels from truths what is heavenly and Divine, and introduces what is hellish, as a consequence of which falsification takes place.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 <a href="2.htm">2</a> If a person first accepts the truths in religious teachings 
and afterwards assents to the falsity of another set of teachings, which happens solely in the case of those who lead an evil life, because evil has an appetite for falsity and freely takes hold of 
it as the truth.  <a href="3.htm">3</a> If a person who is leading an evil life and adopting falsities as his religious teachings takes hold of truths belonging to another set of teachings, he too falsifies truths, because 
he does not acknowledge truths for their own sake, only for the sake of earning some gain, important position, or reputation.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the Word all these kinds of falsification are called acts 
of whoredom and prostitution, because a lawful joining together, which is that of goodness and truth, is meant by a marriage, see <a href="2727.htm">2727</a>-<a href="2759.htm">2759</a>, so that instances of an unlawful joining together are meant 
by acts of whoredom. The truth of this may be recognized from a large number of places in the Word, of which let just these two be brought forward here: In Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
O Jerusalem, you committed whoredom 
because of your renown, and poured out your acts of whoredom on every passer-by. You took some of your garments and made for yourself high places variously coloured, and on them committed whoredom. 
For your adornment you took vessels made of My gold and of My silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself figures of the male, and committed whoredom with them. You took your sons and your 
daughters, whom you had borne to Me, and sacrificed them to them. Were your acts of whoredom a small matter? You committed whoredom with the sons of Egypt, your neighbours, great in flesh, and multiplied 
your whoredom to provoke Me to anger. You committed whoredom with the sons of Asshur, and you committed whoredom with them and were not satisfied. And you multiplied your whoredom, even as far 
as the trading land of Chaldea. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2016:15-17,20,26,28,29&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 16:15-17,20,26,28,29</a>
</blockquote>
ff.  </p>
<p>And in the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
Two women, the daughters of one mother, committed whoredom in Egypt. In their youth they committed whoredom. 
Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem. Oholah committed whoredom under Me and doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours. She bestowed her acts of whoredom on them. Her acts of whoredom 
brought from Egypt she did not give up, for they had lain with her in her youth. Oholibah corrupted her love more than she, and multiplied her acts of whoredom above her sister's acts of whoredom; 
she doted on the sons of Asshur. She added to her acts of whoredom and saw the images of the Chaldeans. As soon as her eyes saw them she desired them. The sons of Babel came to her, into her love-bed. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2023:2-5,7,8,11,12,14,16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 23:2-5,7,8,11,12,14,16</a>

<p>Further examples of the same thing occur in many other places, which may be seen, together with explanations of them as well as of the two quoted here, in <a href="2466.htm">2466</a>, <a href="8904.htm">8904</a>.  </p>

`Et scortentur post deos {1}eorum':  quod significet inde falsa mali, constat ex significatione `scortari post deos {2}gentium' quod sit conjungi falsis mali, nam per `scortari' significatur illegitime 
conjungi, et per `deos {3}gentium' significantur falsa mali; quod `dii {4}' sint falsa, videatur n. 4402 fin., 4544, 7873, 8867, et `gentes' sunt mala, supra [n.] 10638.  Dicitur quod inde falsa mali, 
quia a malo existunt omnia falsa; falsa autem quae non a malo, quidem in externa forma (t)sunt falsa sed non in interna; dantur enim falsa apud illos qui in bono vitae sunt, sed bonum est interius 
in illis et facit ut malum falsi removeatur; inde falsum illud coram angelis non apparet ut falsum sed ut {5}species veri; angeli enim spectant interiora fidei et non exteriora ejus; inde est quod unusquisque 
ex quacumque religione sit salvari {6}possit, etiam gentiles qui nulla vera ex Verbo habent, modo bonum vitae spectaverint ut finem, et doctrinam suam ut medium ad illum finem, videatur n. 
2589-2604. 	[2] In Verbo saepius dicitur `scortari' et per id significatur illegitima conjunctio cum vero, et per `adulterari' illegitima conjunctio cum bono; inde per `scortari' significatur falsificatio 
veri et per `adulterari' adulteratio boni; falsificatio veri {7}fit triplici modo:  Primo, Si homo in malo vitae est et agnoscit vera doctrinae, tunc enim intus in veris est malum, et malum falsificat 
verum, {8}nam malum dissipat caeleste et Divinum {9}e veris, ac implantat infernale, inde falsificatio. 	[3] Secundo, Si homo primum in veris quoad doctrinam est et postea accedit ad falsum alterius 
doctrinae, quod fit solum apud illos qui in malo vitae sunt, quoniam malum appetit falsum, et id libenter arripit pro vero. 	Tertio, Si homo qui in malo quoad vitam est, et in falsis quoad doctrinam, 
arripit vera alterius doctrinae, is quoque falsificat vera, quoniam is vera non agnoscit propter vera sed propter aliquid lucri, honoris, aut famae. 	[4] Omnes hae falsificationes {10}in Verbo 
vocantur scortationes et meretricatus, ex causa quia per conjugium intelligitur legitima conjunctio, quae est boni et veri, videatur n. 2727-2759; {11}inde illegitimae conjunctiones intelliguntur per 
scortationes; {12}quod ita sit, ex pluribus locis in Verbo constare potest, ex quibus solum haec bina afferre licet:  apud Ezechielem, 	Hierosolyma, scortata es propter nomen tuum; et effudisti scortationes 
tuas super omnem transeuntem; sumpsisti de vestibus tuis, et fecisti tibi excelsa variegata, et scortata es super illis:  accepisti vasa ornatus tui ex auro Meo et ex argento Meo quod dederam 
tibi, et fecisti tibi imagines masculi, et scortata es cum illis:  sumpsisti filios tuos et filias tuas {13}quos peperisti Mihi, et sacrificasti illos eis:  num parum hoc de scortationibus tuis?  scortata 
es cum filiis Aegypti vicinis tuis, magnis carne; et multiplicasti scortationem tuam ad irritandum Me:  scortata es cum filiis Aschuris, et scortata es cum eis, et non satiata:  et multiplicasti 
scortationem tuam usque ad terram negotiationis Chaldaeam, xvi 15-17, 20, 26, 28, 29 seq.; </p>
<p>et apud eundem, 	Duae mulieres, filiae unius matris, scortatae sunt in Aegypto, in adolescentia sua scortatae 
sunt, Ohola Samaria et Oholiba Hierosolyma:  scortata est Ohola sub Me, et dilexit amasios suos Assyrios propinquos, dedit scortationes suas super illos:  scortationes suas ex Aegypto non deseruit, 
nam cum illa concubuerunt in adolescentia ejus.  Oholiba corrupit amorem suum prae illa, et multiplicavit scortationes suas supra scortationes sororis suae, filios Aschuris adamavit; {14}addidit ad
