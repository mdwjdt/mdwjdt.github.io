<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7857节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7857.</strong>“断不可用水煮”表它不能出自信之真理。这从“水”的含义清楚可知，“水”是指信之真理（参看<a href="2702.htm">2702</a>，<a href="3058.htm">3058</a>，<a href="3424.htm">3424</a>，<a href="4976.htm">4976</a>，<a href="5668.htm">5668</a>节），因此，“用水煮”表示出自它之物，也就是出自信之真理的良善。这种良善有别于“用火烤”所表示的出自爱的良善（<a href="7852.htm">7852</a>节）。一切良善要么从信，也就是经由信发出，要么从爱发出。当一个人正在重生时，对他来说，良善是从信之真理发出的；因为在此期间，他不是出于对真理的情感，而是出于对真理的顺从而照真理行事，因为真理吩咐他如此 行。然而，后来，当他已经重生时，就出于对真理的情感行善，因而出于爱行善。在圣言中，人的这两种状态被精确区分开来，因为人不能同理处于这两种状态。人在第一个状态不可能进入第二个状态，直到他已重生；人在第二个状态绝不可把自己带回第一个状态。如果有人真的将自己带回去，他就会丧失出于爱对行善的情感，滑回曾用来将他引入良善的信之真理，甚至从信的状态滑出去。这就是在马太福音中，主所说关于最后审判的这些话在内义上所表示的：<br />在房顶上的，不要下来拿家里的东西。在田里的，也不要回去取衣裳。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.17.htm">24:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.18.htm">18</a>）<br />罗得的妻子所表相同，因为她回头向自己身后看（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路17.31.htm">17:31</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路17.32.htm">32</a>）。这一切能使人明白何谓享受出于爱的良善而非出于信之真理的良善，这些事由以下条例来表示：他们要用火烤肉吃，断不可用水煮。<br />祭祀和燔祭表示出于信和爱而对主的敬拜，祭祀表示出于信对主的敬拜，燔祭表示出于爱对主的敬拜。由祭物所制成的筵席表示主的荣耀和享受来自主的良善的欢乐，所以那时他们可以煮肉。因为主的荣耀和享受良善的欢乐是从对信之真理的情感发出的，一切感谢祭也是如此。祭祀的肉要进行煮（参看出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.31.htm">29:31</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.32.htm">32</a>；撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上2.13.htm">2:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上2.15.htm">15</a>；列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上19.21.htm">19:21</a>）。这就是撒迦利亚书中“煮”的含义：<br />在那日，凡耶路撒冷和犹大的锅，都必归万军之耶和华为圣。凡献祭的都必来取这锅，煮肉在其中。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚14.21.htm">14:21</a>）</p>

And by boiling boiled in waters. That this signifies that it shall not go forth from the truth which is of faith, is evident from the signification of "waters," as being the truths which are of faith 
(see n. 2702, 3058, 3424, 4976, 5668); hence "boiled in waters" denotes that which comes forth therefrom, that is, the good which is from the truth of faith; this good is distinguished from the good 
which is from love, which is signified by "roasted with fire" (n. 7852). All spiritual good proceeds either from faith (that is, through faith), or from love. When man is being regenerated, the good with 
him proceeds from the truth of faith; for he then acts in accordance with truth; not from the affection of truth, but from obedience, because it has been so commanded. Afterward, however, when he 
has been regenerated, he does what is good from affection, thus from love. These two states with man are precisely distinguished in the Word, for the reason that man cannot be at the same time in both 
states. He who is in the first state cannot enter into the other until he has been regenerated; and he who is in the second state must not betake himself to the former. If anyone so betakes himself, 
he loses the affection of doing what is good from love, and relapses into the state of faith, which had been of service to him to introduce him to good, and he also relapses beyond this state. This is 
meant in the internal sense by the Lord's words about the Last Judgment in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Then let him that is upon the house not go down to take anything out of his house; and let him that is in the 
field not return backward to take his garments (Matt. 24:17-18); </p>
<p>and also by Lot's wife, in that she looked back behind her (Luke 17:31, 32); whence it can be understood what is meant by enjoying the 
good which goes forth from love, but not that which goes forth from the truth of faith, which things are signified by the command that they should eat the flesh roasted with fire, but not boiled in 
waters.  [2] As by the sacrifices and burnt-offerings was signified the worship of the Lord from faith and love-by sacrifices from faith, and by burnt-offerings from love--and because the glorification 
of the Lord, and gladness on account of the enjoyment of goods from the Lord, was signified by the repasts made of the sanctified things, therefore it was allowed them then to boil their flesh; for 
the glorification of the Lord, and gladness on account of the enjoyment of goods, proceed from the affection of truth which is of faith, as does also all confession. That the flesh of the sacrifice was 
to be boiled, see Exod. 29:31, 32; 1 Sam. 2:13-15; 1 Kings 19:21. Such is the signification of " boiling" in Zechariah: </p>
<p>     In that day every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto 
Jehovah Zebaoth; and all they that sacrifice shall come, and shall take of them, and shall boil in them (Zech. 14:21). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7857</b></p><p><b>7857.</b>
'Nor boiled at all in water' means that it must not come out of the truth of faith. This is clear from the meaning of 'water' as the truths of faith, dealt with in <a href="2702.htm">2702</a>, <a href="3058.htm">3058</a>, <a href="3424.htm">3424</a>, <a href="4976.htm">4976</a>, <a href="5668.htm">5668</a>, and therefore 
'boiled in water' means what comes out of it, that is, good that is the outcome of the truth of faith. This kind of good is distinct from good that is the product of love, meant by 'roasted with 
fire', <a href="7852.htm">7852</a>. All spiritual good emanates either from faith, that is, comes through faith, or from love. While a person is being regenerated good in his case emanates from the truth of faith; for during 
that time he acts in accordance with truth not out of affection for truth but in obedience to it because it commands him so to act. Subsequently however, when he has been regenerated, he does what 
is good out of an affection for it, thus out of love. A very clear distinction is drawn in the Word between these two states with people, because no one can be in both states simultaneously. A person 
in the first state cannot enter the second before he has been regenerated; and a person in the second must not take himself back into the first. If anyone does take himself back he loses his affection 
to do what is good out of love, and slips back into the state of faith which had served to bring him to good, and even slides out of that state of faith. This is what is meant in the internal sense 
by the Lord's words on the subject of the last judgement in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Then let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house; and let him who is in the field not return 
back to take his clothes. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2024:17,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 24:17, 18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The same is also meant by Lot's wife, in that she looked back behind herself, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2017:31,%2032&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 17:31, 32</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>All this may enable one to understand what being allowed 
to enjoy good that comes out of love is, but not good that comes out of the truth of faith, meant by the regulation that they were to eat flesh roasted with fire, but not any boiled in water. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Worship 
of the Lord springing from faith and love was meant by sacrifices and burnt offerings - from faith by sacrifices and from love by burnt offerings. And glorification of the Lord and feelings of 
gladness for the enjoyment of good things that came from the Lord were meant by feasts of consecrated things. All this being so, they were allowed to boil flesh on such occasions. For glorification of 
the Lord and gladness for the enjoyment of good things emanates from an affection for the truth of faith, and so too does all thanksgiving (confessio). For evidence that the sacrificial flesh was boiled, 
see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2029:31,%2032;%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 29:31, 32; 1</a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Sam%202:13,%2015;%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Sam 2:13, 15; 1</a> Kings 19:21. The same is meant by 'boiling' in Zechariah, </p>
<p>On that day every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holiness to Jehovah Zebaoth. And all who 
offer sacrifice will come and take from them and boil in them. Zech. 14:21. </p>

`Et coquendo coctum [in] aquis': quod significet quod non exibit ex vero quod fidei, constat ex significatione `aquarum' quod sint vera quae fidei, de qua n. 2702, 3058, 3424, 4976, 5668; inde `coctum 
aquis' est {1} quod inde exit, hoc est, bonum quod ex {2}vero fidei; hoc bonum distinguitur a bono quod ex amore, quod significatur per `assum igne,' n. 7852.  Omne bonum spirituale vel procedit ex 
fide, hoc est, per fidem, vel procedit ex amore; {3}cum homo regeneratur, bonum apud illum tunc procedit ex vero fidei, nam facit tunc secundum verum non ex affectione veri sed ex oboedientia quia ita 
mandatum est; postea vero cum regeneratus est, facit bonum ex affectione, ita ex amore; hi bini status apud hominem in Verbo prorsus distinguuntur, ex causa quia homo in utroque statu non simul potest 
esse; qui in primo statu est non potest intrare in alterum antequam {4} regeneratus est; et qui in altero statu non in priorem se conferet; si quis se confert, amittit tunc affectionem bonum faciendi 
ex amore, et relabitur in statum fidei, qui illi inserviverat ad introducendum ad bonum, et quoque extra illum; hoc in sensu interno intelligitur per Domini verba de ultimo judicio apud Matthaeum, {5}Tunc 
qui super domo {6}, ne descendat ad tollendum quid e domo sua; et qui in agro, ne revertatur retro ad tollendum vestimenta sua, xxiv 17, 18; </p>
<p>et quoque per `uxorem Lothi, quod {7}respexerit post 
se, Luc. xvii 31, 32; inde {8}intelligi potest {9}quid sit frui bono quod exit ex amore, non autem quod ex vero fidei, quae significantur per quod `comederent carnem assam igne, non autem coctam in 
aquis' {10}. 	2 Quia per `sacrificia et holocausta' significabatur cultus Domini ex fide et amore, per `sacrificia' ex fide et per `holocausta' ex amore, et quia {11}glorificatio Domini, et laetificatio 
propter fruitionem bonorum a Domino significabatur per `comessationes ex sanctificatis,' idcirco concessum fuit tunc carnem coquere; glorificatio enim Domini, et (x)laetificatio propter fruitionem 
bonorum, procedunt ex affectione veri quod fidei, sicut etiam omnis confessio; quod caro sacrificii coqueretur, videatur Exod. xxix 31, 32; 1 Sam. ii 13, 15; 1 Reg. xix 21.  Tale significatur per `coctionem' 
apud Sachariam, In die illo erit omnis olla in Hierosolyma et in Jehudah sanctitas Jehovae Zebaoth, et venient omnes sacrificantes, et sument de illis, et coquent in illis, xiv 21. 	@1 i
