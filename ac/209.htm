<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>209.</strong>“好作食物”、“悦人的眼目”、“可喜爱的，能使人聪明”，这些用词都与意志相关，适用于上古之人，因为他们的恶都发于意志。当论及洪水之后的人，圣经的用词则更与觉性相关，因为上古之人是凭良善认识真理，洪水之后的人则是藉真理认识良善。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]209.</strong> The words employed here — the tree was good for eating, appealing to the eyes, desirable for lending insight — are expressions that applied to the nature of the people living in that earliest era. They have to do with the will in particular, because the evils of those people gushed out of their will. Where the Word describes those who came after the Flood, it uses words that refer not so much to the will as to the intellect. Among the earliest people, you see, goodness led to truth, while for the people who followed the Flood, truth led to goodness. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 209</b></p><p><b>209.</b>
The expressions here employed, as that "the tree was good for food, pleasant to the eyes, and desirable for giving intelligence" are such as were adapted to the genius of those who lived in that most 
ancient time, having especial reference to the will, because their evils streamed out from the will. Where the Word treats of the people who lived after the flood, such expressions are used as relate 
not so much to the will as to the understanding; for the most ancient people had truth from good, but those who lived after the flood had good from truth. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 209</b></p><p><b>209.</b>
The expressions used here about the tree being good for food, appetizing to the eyes, desirable for imparting intelligence, are such as were applicable to the disposition of the people who lived in those 
most ancient times. In particular these words have regard to the will, for it was from the will that their evils poured out. When the Word is dealing with those who came after the Flood, such expressions 
are used as have regard not so much to the will as to the understanding; for the most ancient people possessed from good that which was true, while those coming after the Flood possessed from 
truth that which was good.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 209</b>
</p><b>209.</b>
Voces quae hic adhibentur, sicut quod arbor bona ad esum, appetibilis oculis, desiderabilis ad dandum intelligentiam, sunt tales quae applicabiles fuerunt indoli eorum qui antiquissimo illo tempore 
vixerunt; spectant in specie voluntatem, nam a voluntate scaturiebant mala eorum; ubi in Verbo agitur de postdiluvianis, tales voces adhibentur quae non spectant ita voluntatem sed intellectum; nam antiquissimi 
a bono habebant verum, sed hi seu postdiluviani a vero bonum. </p>
