<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3927节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3927.</strong>“拉结说，我靠神的角力与我姐姐大大相争，并且得胜”在至高意义上表主自己的能力，在内在意义上表人其中得胜的试探，在外在意义上表属世人的抵制。这从“神的角力”和“相争”的含义清楚可知：“神的角力”（wrestlings of God）和“相争”（wrestling）是指试探，因为试探无非是内在人与外在人，或属灵人与属世人的较量；各自都渴望掌权，并且当有涉及掌权的行动时，冲突就会发生，这种冲突在此就被描绘为“大大相争”。至于“得胜”表示胜利，这是显而易见的，无需解释。<br />这些话在至高意义上表示主自己的能力，这是因为主在世处于（软弱的）人身时，凭自己的能力经受所有试探，并凭自己的能力战胜它们。这和所有人都不同，人凭自己永远不能承受任何属灵的试探，并在其中得胜；唯有在他里面的主去经受并战胜。关于这些主题，可参看前面的阐述和说明，即：主经受最严厉的试探，远比其他所有人所遭受的试探严厉得多（<a href="1663.htm">1663</a>，<a href="1668.htm">1668</a>，<a href="1690.htm">1690</a>，<a href="1737.htm">1737</a>，<a href="1787.htm">1787</a>，<a href="1789.htm">1789</a>，<a href="1812.htm">1812</a>，<a href="1813.htm">1813</a>，<a href="1815.htm">1815</a>，<a href="1820.htm">1820</a>，<a href="2776.htm">2776</a>，<a href="2786.htm">2786</a>，<a href="2795.htm">2795</a>，<a href="2813.htm">2813</a>，<a href="2816.htm">2816</a>，<a href="3318.htm">3318</a>节）；主凭自己的能力争战并得胜（<a href="1616.htm">1616</a>，<a href="1692.htm">1692</a>，<a href="1813.htm">1813</a>，<a href="3381.htm">3381</a>节）；唯独主在人里面争战（<a href="1692.htm">1692</a>节）。<br />至于“神的角力”和“相争”在内在意义上表示人在其中得胜的试探，这从刚才所述明显可知。但之所以在外在意义上表示属世人的抵制，是因为所有试探并非别的什么。如前所述，属灵的试探当中存在关于统治权的争夺，即谁将拥有至高无上的权力，是内在人还是外在人；或也可说，是属灵人还是属世人，因为它们彼此对立（<a href="3913.htm">3913</a>节）。事实上，当人经历试探时，他的内在人或属灵人由主经由天使掌管；而他的外在人或属世人则由地狱灵掌管。它们之间的冲突被此人感觉为试探。当一个人在信仰和生活上能够重生时，他就会在试探中得胜，而当他不能重生时，便在试探中屈服。属世人的这种抵制就由拉结的这句话，即她“与她姐姐大大相争”来表示。因为此处“姐姐”所指的“利亚”表示外在人的情感，而“拉结”表示内在人的情感（<a href="3793.htm">3793</a>，<a href="3819.htm">3819</a>节）。</p>

And Rachel said, With the wrestlings of God have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed. That this signifies in the supreme sense own power; in the internal sense, temptation in which there 
is victory; and in the external sense, resistance by the natural man, is evident from the signification of the "wrestlings of God" and of "wrestling," as being temptations; for temptations are nothing 
else than wrestlings of the internal man with the external, or of the spiritual man with the natural; for each desires to rule, and when dominion is in question, combat arises, which is here called "wrestling." 
That "to prevail" is to overcome, is evident without explication. [2] That in the supreme sense these words signify own power, is because the Lord, when He was in the world and in the human 
there, sustained all temptations from His own power, and conquered from His own power; differently from every man, who never sustains any spiritual temptation and conquers in it from his own power; 
for it is the Lord who sustains and conquers within him. (See what has been stated and shown on these subjects before, namely, That the Lord sustained the most grievous temptations, beyond all others, 
n. 1663, 1668, 1690, 1737, 1787, 1789, 1812, 1813, 1815, 1820, 2776, 2786, 2795, 2813, 2816, 3318: That the Lord combated and conquered from His own power, n. 1616, 1692, 1813, 3381: And that the Lord 
alone combats in man, n. 1692.)  [3] That in the internal sense the "wrestlings of God" and "prevailing" denote the temptations in which man conquers, is evident from what has been said just above. 
But that in the external sense there is signified resistance by the natural man is because all temptation is nothing else; for as before said in spiritual temptations there is dispute about dominion, 
as to which shall have the supremacy, the internal man or the external; or what is the same, the spiritual man or the natural, for these are opposed to each other (n. 3913). For when man is in temptations, 
his internal or spiritual man is ruled by the Lord through angels; but his external or natural man through infernal spirits; and the combat between them is that which is perceived by the man as 
temptation. When a man is such in faith and life that he can be regenerated, he will conquer in temptations; but when he is such that he cannot be regenerated, he yields in temptations. That there is 
resistance by the natural man, is signified by its being said that she "wrestled with her sister;" for by "Leah," who is here the "sister," is signified the affection of the external man; but by "Rachel," 
the affection of the internal man (n. 3793, 3819). </p>

'And Rachel said, With the wrestlings of God I have wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed' in the highest sense means [the Lord's] own power, in the internal sense temptation in which a person 
overcomes, in the external sense resistance offered by the natural man. This is clear from the meaning of 'the wrestlings of God' and of 'wrestling' as temptations, since temptations are nothing else 
than the wrestlings of the internal man with the external, or of the spiritual man with the natural, for each desires to have dominion over the other. And when there is any to-do about that dominion, 
conflict takes place, which in this case is portrayed as 'wrestling'. As regards 'prevailing' meaning overcoming, this is clear without explanation. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason these words in the highest sense 
mean His own power is that when in the world He was in the [infirm] Human the Lord suffered all temptations by His own power and overcame them by His own power, unlike any human being who never endures 
any spiritual temptation by his own power and overcomes in it; only the Lord residing with him does so. But see what has been stated and shown already concerning these matters: </p>
<p> The Lord suffered 
the severest temptations, much severer than those suffered by others, <a href="1663.htm">1663</a>, <a href="1668.htm">1668</a>, <a href="1690.htm">1690</a>, <a href="1737.htm">1737</a>, <a href="1787.htm">1787</a>, <a href="1789.htm">1789</a>, <a href="1812.htm">1812</a>, <a href="1813.htm">1813</a>, <a href="1815.htm">1815</a>, <a href="1820.htm">1820</a>, <a href="2776.htm">2776</a>, <a href="2786.htm">2786</a>, <a href="2795.htm">2795</a>, <a href="2813.htm">2813</a>, <a href="2816.htm">2816</a>, <a href="3318.htm">3318</a>. </p>
<p>The Lord fought and overcame 
by His own power, <a href="1616.htm">1616</a>, <a href="1692.htm">1692</a>, <a href="1813.htm">1813</a>, <a href="3381.htm">3381</a>. And the Lord alone fights in man's conflicts, <a href="1692.htm">1692</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 As regards 'the wrestlings of God' and 'prevailing' meaning, in the internal sense, temptations in 
which a person overcomes, this is clear from what has been stated immediately above. But the reason why in the external sense resistance from the natural man is meant is that no temptation is anything 
else. For as has been stated, in spiritual temptations there is a to-do over who is to have dominion, that is to say, who is going to have the power. Is the internal man to have it or the external - 
or what amounts to the same, the spiritual man or the natural? For they stand opposed to each other, <a href="3913.htm">3913</a>. Indeed when a person undergoes temptations his internal or spiritual man is governed by the Lord 
through angels, but his external or natural man by spirits from hell. And the conflict that takes place between these is experienced by that person as temptation. When a person both in faith and in 
life is such that he is able to be regenerated he overcomes in temptations, but when he is such that he is not able to be regenerated he goes under in temptations. The resistance offered by the natural 
man is meant by Rachel's statement that she had wrestled with her sister, for Leah, to whom 'sister' refers here, means the external man's affection, but 'Rachel' the internal man's, <a href="3793.htm">3793</a>, <a href="3819.htm">3819</a>. </p>

`Et dixit Rachel, Luctationibus Dei luctata sum cum sorore mea, etiam valui': quod significet in supremo sensu propriam Potentiam, in interno tentationem in qua vincit, in externo resistentiam a 
naturali homine, constat a significatione `luctationum Dei' et `luctari' quod sint tentationes; tentationes enim non aliud sunt quam luctationes interni hominis cum externo, seu spiritualis hominis 
cum naturali, uterque enim dominari videt, et cum agitur de dominio, fit pugna, quae hic est luctatio; quod `valere' sit vincere, constat absque explicatione.  [2] Quod illa verba in sensu supremo 
significent propriam Potentiam, est quia Dominus omnes tentationes, cum fuit {1}in mundo et in humano ibi, ex propria potentia sustinuit, et ex propria potentia vicit, secus ac omnis homo, qui nusquam 
ex propria potentia aliquam tentationem spiritualem sustinet et in illa vincit, sed Dominus apud illum; </p>
<p>{2}at videantur quae de his prius dicta et ostensa sunt, nempe quod Dominus prae aliis gravissimas 
tentationes sustinuerit, n. 1663, 1668, 1690, 1737, 1787, 1789, 1812, 1813, 1815, 1820, 2776, 2786, 2795, 2813, 2816, 3318; quod Dominus ex propria Potentia pugnaverit et vicerit, n. {3}1616, 
1692, 1813, 1815, et quod Dominus solus apud hominem pugnet, n. 1692.  [3] Quod in sensu interno `luctationes Dei' et `valere' sint tentationes in quibus {4}homo vincit, constat ab illis quae 
mox supra dicta sunt: quod autem in sensu externo sit resistentia a naturali homine, est quia omnis tentatio non aliud est; agitur enim in tentationibus spiritualibus, ut dictum, de dominio, quis 
nempe potestatem habebit, num homo internus aut num externus, seu quod idem, num spiritualis {5}aut num naturalis, sunt enim inter se oppositi, n. 3913; cum enim homo in tentationibus est, tunc internus 
seu spiritualis ejus homo a Domino per angelos regitur, sed externus seu naturalis per spiritus infernales; pugna inter illos est quae sicut tentatio percipitur apud hominem: cum homo talis est 
et fide et vita, ut regenerari possit, tunc in tentationibus {6}vincit, at cum talis est ut non regenerari possit, tunc in tentationibus succumbit: quod resistentia a naturali homine sit, significatur 
per verba quod `luctata sit cum sorore sua, per `Leam' enim, quae hic est soror, {7}significatur affectio externi hominis, per `Rachelem' autem affectio interni, n. 3793, 3819. @1 A had in
