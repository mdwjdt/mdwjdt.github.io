<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第783节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>783.</strong>“凡要进入的”表居于该教会成员身上的事物。这一点从刚才所述清楚可知。同样，“凡有血肉的，有公有母，都进去了”表居于他身上的各类真理与良善，因为前面数次阐述和说明，“公”与“母”表真理与良善。“正如神所吩咐他的”表为了预备他接受，这一点下面还会提到。对主而言，“吩咐”就是预备并实施。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]783.</strong> The symbolism of those entering as attributes of the people in the church can be seen from the above.<br />The meaning of a male and a female of all flesh entered as the fact that they had every kind of truth and goodness in them also follows. The symbolism of male and female as truth and goodness has been stated and demonstrated several times before.{*1} As God had commanded means that they had been prepared to receive such things. This meaning and this identification of the things to be received has already been discussed.{*2} For the Lord, to command is to prepare someone and to act.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the symbolism of the phrase "male and female," see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_783/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_718" target=_top>718</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_783/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_725" target=_top>725</a>, and the sections referred to in note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_783/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_718" target=_top>718</a>.

That "they that went in" signifies the things that were with the man of the church, is therefore evident; and it also follows that "went in male and female, of all flesh" signifies that there were with 
him goods and truths of every kind, for it has been stated and shown several times before that the "male" and the "female" signify truths and goods. "As God commanded him." That this signifies that 
he had been prepared to receive them, has also been mentioned below. With the Lord, to "command" is to prepare and do. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 783</b></p><p><b>783.</b>
'Those who were going in' means things residing with the member of the Church. This is clear from what has just been stated. It also follows that 'male and female of all flesh went in' means that truths 
and goods of every kind resided with him, for the fact that 'male and female' means truths and goods has been stated and shown several times already. 'As God had commanded' means for the reception 
of which he had been made ready. The meaning of statements such as this has also been discussed already. With reference to the Lord, 'commanding' means preparing and carrying out. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 783</b>
</p><b>783.</b>
Quod 'intrantes' significent quae apud hominem Ecclesiae constat inde: tum quod 'masculus et femina de omni carne intrarunt significent quod vera et bona omnis generis apud eum essent, quo quoque sequitur; 
nam quod 'masculus et femina' significent vera e bona, prius aliquoties dictum et ostensum est. 'Sicut praeceperat Deus quod significet, ad quae recipienda praeparatus esset, de quibus, quo talia, 
etiam prius dictum est; 'praecipere' apud Dominum est prae parare et facere. </p>
