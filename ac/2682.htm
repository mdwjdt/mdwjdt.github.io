<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2682节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2682.</strong>“她就把孩子撇在一棵矮树底下”表对没有发觉丝毫真理与良善的绝望。这从“孩子”和“矮树”的含义，以及这一行为中所体现出的感情，也就是绝望感清楚可知：“孩子”是指属灵真理（参看<a href="2669.htm">2669</a>，<a href="2677.htm">2677</a>节）；“矮树”或灌木是指直觉，不过这种直觉非常微弱，几近于无。正因如此，经上采用“在一棵矮树底下”这样的说法，因为“矮树”和“树”一个意思，只是程度较低，“树”表直觉（参看<a href="103.htm">103</a>，<a href="2163.htm">2163</a>节）。由此明显可知，“她就把孩子撇在一棵矮树底下”表对没有发觉丝毫真理与良善的绝望。撇在一棵矮树底下表就真理与良善而言，只剩下荒凉，直到绝望。这一点明显可见于约伯记：<br />穷乏饥饿，独自一人。他们逃到干旱之地，直到昨夜的荒废凄凉，在灌木上采野葵；住在裂谷，地洞和岩穴中；在灌木丛中叫唤，在野蓟下聚集。（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯30.3.htm">30:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯30.4.htm">4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯30.6.htm">6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯30.7.htm">7</a>）<br />此处论述的是真理的荒凉，是以古教会常用的表述形式来描述的（因为约伯记是古教会的一本书），如“穷乏饥饿，独自一人”、“逃到干旱之地，直到昨夜的荒废凄凉”、“住在裂谷，地洞和岩穴中”，以及“在灌木上采野葵”、“在灌木丛中叫唤”。在以赛亚书中也是如此：<br />他们必来，他们都落在荒凉的溪谷内、磐石的裂缝里和一切灌木丛中，并一切水道里。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛7.19.htm">7:19</a>）<br />此处论述的也是荒凉，以同样的表述形式来描述，也就是说“落在荒凉的溪谷内、磐石的裂缝里和一切灌木丛中”。<br />本节论述了正经历改造之人的第二状态，也就是他们变得无知，直到对真理一无所知，甚至到了绝望地步的一种状态。他们变得如此无知的原因是为熄灭说服之光（persuasive light）。说服之光具有这样的性质，它既能照虚假，也能照真理，从而通过真理制造对虚假的信仰，通过虚假制造对真理的信仰，同时信靠他们自己。他们变得如此无知，也是为了叫他们通过亲身体验被引导承认这一事实：良善与真理丝毫不源于他们自己，或他们自己的东西，只来源于主。正经历改造之人变得无知，甚至到了绝望的地步，就在这时，他们便收到安慰和启示，这从下文清楚看出来。因为来自主的真理之光无法流入源于自我的说服性思维（persuasive thinking）；事实上，这种思维具有熄灭真理之光的性质。在来世，说服性思维显为冬光；不过，一靠近天堂之光，就有一种黑暗取代这冬光，这黑暗当中就有对一切真理的无知。对那些正经历改造的人来说，这种状态被称为真理荒凉的状态，在圣言的内义中常常被论述。<br />但很少有人了解这种状态，因为如今只有极少数人正在重生。对那些未重生的人而言，他们是否知道真理，或他们知道的是不是真理，都一样，只要他们能把一件事当成真理进行下去。但正在重生的人会多多思考教义和生命，因为他们会多多思考永恒的救恩。因此，如果真理遗弃他们，他们会发自内心感到忧伤，因为真理是他们全部思想和情感的对象。从以下分析可以看出正在重生之人和未重生之人各自状态的性质：活在肉身的人就其灵而言，身处天堂，就其肉体而言，身处尘世；因为他生来就进入这两个世界，并且就其灵而言如此被造，以致他实际上与天使同在，同时又藉着属身体之物与世人同在。不过，由于极少有人相信自己拥有死后会活着的灵，所以正在重生的人也就为数甚少。对那些相信自己拥有一个灵的人来说，来世就是他们全部的思想和情感，相比之下，这个世界根本算不了什么。而对那些不相信的人来说，这个世界就是他们全部的思想和情感，相比之下，来世则根本算不了什么。前者是那些能重生之人，后者则是那些不能重生之人。</p>

And she cast the child under one of the shrubs. That this signifies despair that nothing of truth and good was perceived, is evident from the signification of the "child," as being spiritual truth (see 
n. 2669, 2677); and from the signification of a "shrub" or "bush," as being perception, but so little as to be scarcely anything; on which account it is also said "under one of the shrubs" having the 
same signification as trees, but in a less degree; and that "trees" signify perceptions may be seen above (n. 103, 2163): also from the feeling there was in the act, which was one of despair; all which 
shows that by her casting the child under one of the shrubs is signified despair that nothing of truth and good was perceived. That being "cast under one of the shrubs" denotes to be desolated as 
to truth and good even to despair, is manifest in Job: </p>
<p>     Alone in want and famine; they flee to the drought, yesternight desolation and wasteness; they pluck mallows upon the shrub; to dwell in the 
cleft of the valleys, in holes of the dust and of the rocks; among the shrubs they were groaning, under the thistle they were joined together (Job 30:3-4, 6-7); </p>
<p>where the desolation of truth is treated 
of, which is described by forms of expression in common use in the Ancient Church (for the book of Job is a book of the Ancient Church), such as to be alone, in want and in famine, to flee to the 
drought, yesternight desolation and wasteness; to dwell in the clefts of the valleys and of the rocks; also to pluck mallows upon the shrub, and to groan among the shrubs. So too in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     They 
shall come and shall rest all of them in the rivers of desolations, in the clefts of the rocks, and in all shrubs, and in all water courses (Isa. 7:19); </p>
<p>where also desolation is treated of, which 
is described by similar forms of expression, that is to say, by resting in the rivers of desolations, in the clefts of the rocks, and in the shrubs. [2] In this verse the second state of those who are 
being reformed is treated of, which is that they are reduced to ignorance till they know nothing of truth, and this even to despair. The cause of their being reduced to such ignorance is that persuasive 
light may be extinguished, which is of such a nature as to illuminate falsities equally as well as truths, and to induce a belief in falsity by means of truths, and a belief in truth by means of 
falsities, and at the same time trust in themselves; also that they may be led by experience itself to a knowledge of the fact that nothing of good and nothing of truth is of self or of man's own, but 
from the Lord. They who are being reformed are reduced into ignorance even to despair, and then they have comfort and enlightenment, as is evident from what follows; for the light of truth from the Lord 
cannot flow into the persuasive which is from man's own; for this is of such a nature as to extinguish that light. In the other life that which is persuasive appears like the light of winter; but 
at the approach of the light of heaven, instead of that light there comes darkness, in which there is ignorance of all truth. With those who are being reformed this state is called the state of desolation 
of truth, and this also is much treated of in the internal sense of the Word. [3] But of this state few have any knowledge, because few at this day are being regenerated. To those who are not being 
regenerated it makes no difference whether they know the truth, or do not; nor whether what they do know be truth or not, provided they can palm a thing off for truth. But they who are being regenerated 
think much about doctrine and life, because they think much about eternal salvation; and therefore if truth be deficient with them, as it is the subject of their thought and affection, they grieve 
at heart. The state of the one and of the other may be seen from this: While a man is in the body he is living as to his spirit in heaven, and as to his body in the world; for he is born into both, 
and has been so created that as to his spirit he can be actually with the angels, and at the same time with men by means of what is of the body. But as there are few who believe that they have a spirit 
which is to live after death, there are few who are being regenerated. To those who believe it, the other life is the whole of their thought and affection, and the world is nothing in comparison; 
but to those who do not believe it, the world is the whole of their thought and affection, and the other life is in comparison nothing. The former are they who can be regenerated, but the latter are they 
who cannot. </p>

'And she put the boy under one of the shrubs' means despair that no truth or good at all was perceived. This is clear from the meaning of 'the boy' as spiritual truth, dealt with in <a href="2669.htm">2669</a>, <a href="2677.htm">2677</a>, and from 
the meaning of 'a shrub' or a bush as perception, yet so small as to be scarcely anything at all - that smallness being the reason for the use of the expression, 'under one of the shrubs' (for by 
'shrubs' the same is meant, though in a minor degree, as by trees, which mean perceptions, see <a href="103.htm">103</a>, <a href="2163.htm">2163</a>) - and also from the feeling expressed in the action, which is the feeling of despair. From this 
it is evident that 'she put the boy under one of the shrubs' means despair that no truth or good at all was perceived. That being put under one of the shrubs means being left desolate so far as truth 
and good are concerned, to the point of despair, is evident in Job, </p>
<blockquote>
In poverty and in hunger, one all alone. They were fleeing to the drought, to the previous night's desolation and devastation, 
picking mallows on the shrub; in the cleft of the valleys to dwell, in holes of the dust and rocks; among the shrubs they were groaning, under the wild thistle they were joined together. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Job%2030:-3,%204,%206,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Job 30:-3, 4, 6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This is a reference to the desolation of truth, which is described by means of expressions used commonly in the Ancient Church - for the Book of Job is a book of the Ancient Church - such as 
'in poverty and in hunger, one all alone', 'fleeing to the drought, the previous night's desolation and devastation', 'in the clefts of valleys and rocks to dwell', as well as 'picking mallows on the 
shrubs', and 'groaning among the shrubs'. So also in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
They will come and all of them will rest in rivers of desolations, in the clefts of rocks, and on all bushes, and in all water-courses. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%207:%2019&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 7: 19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This also is a reference to desolation, which is described by means of similar forms of expression, namely 'resting in rivers of desolations, in the clefts of rocks, and on bushes'. </p>

In this present verse the subject is the second state of those who are being reformed, which is a state when they are reduced to ignorance, so that they do not know any truth at all, even to the 
point of despair. The reason they are reduced to such ignorance is so that the persuasive light which shines from the proprium may be extinguished. This light is such that it illuminates falsities as 
much as it does truths and so leads to a belief in what is false by means of truths and a belief in what is true by means of falsities, and at the same time to trust in themselves. They are also reduced 
to such ignorance in order that they may be led through actual experience into a recognition of the fact that no good or truth at all originates in themselves or what is properly their own but in the 
Lord. Those who are being reformed are reduced to ignorance, even to the state of despair, at which point they receive comfort and enlightenment, as is clear from what follows. For the light of truth 
from the Lord cannot flow into the persuasive thinking that originates in the proprium; indeed its nature is such as to extinguish that light. In the next life that persuasive thinking presents itself 
as the light in winter, but with the approach of the light of heaven a kind of darkness consisting in ignorance of all truth takes the place of that wintry light. This state with those who are being 
reformed is called a state of desolation of truth, and is also frequently the subject in the internal sense of the Word. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But few are able to know about that state because few at the present 
day are being regenerated. To people who are not being regenerated, it is all the same whether they know the truth or whether they do not, and also whether what they do know is the truth or whether it 
is not, provided that they can pass a thing off as the truth. But people who are being regenerated give much thought to doctrine and to life since they give much thought to eternal salvation. Consequently 
if truth deserts them, they grieve at heart because truth is the object of all their thought and affection. The nature of the state of those who are being regenerated and the nature of those who 
are not may become clear from the following consideration: While in the body a person lives as to his spirit in heaven and as to his body in the world. He is born into both and has been so created that 
he is in effect able as to his spirit to be with angels, and at the same time to be with men through the things which belong to the body. But since those who believe that they have a spirit which will 
continue to live after death are few in number those who are being regenerated are few. To those who do believe that they have a spirit the next life forms the whole of their thought and affection, 
and the world in comparison none at all. But to those who do not believe that they have a spirit the world forms the whole of their thought and affection and the next life in comparison none at all. 
The former are those who can be regenerated, but the latter those who cannot. </p>

`Et conjecit puerum sub unum fruticum': quod significet desperationem quod nihil veri et boni perciperet, constat a significatione `pueri' quod sit spirituale verum, de qua n. 2669, 2677; et ex significatione 
`fruticis seu virgulti' quod sit perceptio, sed ita parum ut vix aliquid; quare etiam dicitur sub `unum fruticum,' similiter sed in minore gradu ac arbores, quae quod significent perceptiones, 
videatur n. 103, 2163; tam ab affectu in illo facto, qui est desperationis; inde patet quod per `conjecit puerum sub unum fruticum' significetur desperatio quod nihil veri et boni perciperet: aliquod 
`sub unum fruticum conjici' sit desolari quoad verum et bonum usque ad desperationem, patet apud Hiobum, 	In egestate et in esurie solitarius; fugientes ad siccitatem, praeteritam noctem, desolationem 
et vastitatem; carpentes malvam super frutice:... in fissura vallium ad habitandum, foraminibus pulveris et petrarum; inter frutices gemebant, sub carduo conjungebantur, xxx 3, 4, [6], 7; </p>
<p>ubi de 
desolatione veri {1}, quae describitur per formulas in Antiqua Ecclesia sollemnes, (Liber enim Hiobi est Antiquae Ecclesiae liber:) ut `esse in egestate et esurie solitarius, fugere ad siccitatem, praeteritam 
noctem, desolationem, (o)vastitatem, in fissuris vallium et petrarum habitare,' tum `carpere malvam super frutice, et inter frutices gemere': ut quoque apud Esaiam, 	Venient et quiescent omnes 
in fluviis desolationum, in fissuris petrarum, et in omnibus virgultis, et in omnibus ductibus, vii 19; </p>
<p>ubi etiam de desolatione, quae per similes formulas describitur, scilicet per `quiescere in 
fluviis desolationum, in fissuris petrarum, et in virgultis.(n)  [2] In hoc versu agitur de altero statu eorum qui reformantur, qui est quod redigantur ad ignorantiam ut nihil veri sciant, et hoc usque 
ad desperationem; causa ut {2} redigantur in talem ignorantiam, est ut exstinguatur lux persuasiva [quae ex proprio], quae talis est ut illuminet aeque falsa ac vera, ac inducat fidem falsi per vera, 
`et fidem veri per falsa,' et simul sui fiduciam; tum quoque ut in cognitionem per ipsam experientiam perducantur de eo quod nihil boni et nihil veri a seipso seu a proprio, sed ex Domino; rediguntur 
illi qui reformantur, in ignorantiam usque ad desperationem, et tunc iis solatium et illustratio, ut constat ab iis quae sequuntur; influere enim non potest lux veri a Domino in persuasivum quod ex 
proprio; hoc enim talis naturae est ut illam lucem exstinguat; apparet {3} persuasivum in altera vita instar lucis hiemalis, sed ad approximationem lucis caeli, fit pro luce (o)illa tenebricosum, in 
quo est omnis veri ignorantia: hic status vocatur desolationis veri apud eos qui reformantur, et de illo {4} agitur quoque multum in sensu interno Verbi.  [3] Sed de eo statu pauci scire possunt quia 
pauci hodie regenerantur; qui non regenerantur, illis perinde est sive verum sciant vel non sciant, tum sive verum sit vel non sit, quod sciunt, modo venditare aliquid pro vero possint; at qui regenerantur, 
multum de doctrina et vita, quia de salute aeterna, cogitant, ac ideo, si illis verum deficit, quia est cogitationis et affectionis eorum, dolent corde.  Qualis status unius et alterius, constare 
potest ex hoc; homo dum in corpore est, quoad spiritum vivit in caelo, et quoad corpus in mundo; in utrumque nascitur; ac ita creatus est ut possit actualiter quoad spiritum esse cum angelus, e simul 
per illa quae sunt corporis, esse cum hominibus; sed quia pauci sunt qui credunt quod iis spiritus qui victurus post mortem, pauci sunt qui regenerantur {5}; qui credunt, illis altera vita est omne 
cogitationi; et affectionis, et mundus est respective nihil; qui autem non credunt illis mundus est omne cogitationis et affectionis, et altera vita est respective nihil; illi sunt qui regenerari possunt,
