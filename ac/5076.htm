<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5076.</strong>“他们得罪了”表颠倒的次序。这从“得罪”的含义清楚可知，“得罪”是指违背神性次序行事。“罪”并非表示别的。此处“他们得罪”（即酒政和膳长）表示外在感官事物相对内层事物来说处于颠倒的次序，以致前者与后者不一致或不相对应。</p>

That they sinned. That this signifies inverted order, is evident from the signification of "sinning," as being to act contrary to Divine order: whatever is contrary to this is "sin." Divine order itself 
is Divine truth from Divine good. All are in this order who are in truth from good, that is, who are in faith from charity, for truth is of faith, and good is of charity; and they are contrary to 
this order who are not in truth from good, consequently who are in truth from evil, or in falsity from evil; nothing else is signified by "sin." Here by their "sinning"-the butler and the baker-is signified 
that external sensuous things were in inverted order relatively to interior things, so that they did not accord or did not correspond. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5076</b></p><p><b>5076.</b>
That they sinned' means that order had become turned around. This is clear from the meaning of 'sinning' as acting contrary to Divine order, anything whatever contrary to that order being sin. Essentially, 
Divine order is Divine Truth grounded in Divine Good; and this order exists with everyone whose truth is grounded in good, that is, whose faith is grounded in charity, truth being the essence of 
faith and good the essence of charity. But everyone acts contrary to that order whose truth is not grounded in good, consequently whose truth or else falsity is grounded in evil. Nothing else than this 
is meant by sin. Here 'they sinned' - the cupbearer and the baker - means that the order in which the external senses existed in relation to interior things had become turned around, so that the former 
were not in accord or did not agree with the latter. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 5076</b>
</p><b>5076.</b>
`Peccarunt': quod significet inversum ordinem, constat ex significatione `peccare' quod sit agere contra ordinem Divinum; </p>
<p>quicquid contra illum est, est peccatum; ipse ordo Divinus est Divinum Verum 
ex Divino Bono; in illo ordine sunt omnes qui in vero sunt ex bono, hoc est, qui in fide ex charitate, {1}nam verum est fidei et bonum est charitatis; at contra illum ordinem sunt qui non in vero 
ex bono sunt, consequenter qui {2} in vero ex malo vel in falso ex malo; per peccatum non aliud significatur; (m)hic per `peccarunt', nempe pincerna et pistor, significatur quod in inverso ordine 
essent sensualia externa ad interiora, sic ut non concordarent seu non corresponderent.(n) </p>
