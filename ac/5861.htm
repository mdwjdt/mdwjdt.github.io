<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5861节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5861.</strong>由此明显可知，就其内层，因而就其灵而言，人活在世上时就与其他灵人联系在一起。由此还明显可知，他以这种方式与他们相联：他若不与他们在一起，就无法思想或意愿任何事，以致他的内层与灵界相通；他只能以这种方式，而非其它方式被主引导。当人进入来世时，他便将不信有任何灵人与他同在，尤其不信任何地狱灵与他同在带来。因此，他若愿意，与他一直接触并派出灵人与他同在的社群就被指给他看。而且，在经历了几个初步状态之后，他最终回到相同的社群，因为这个社群与在他里面获得掌控权的爱行动一致。有几次我看见人们被指示他们自己的社群。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5861</b></p><p><b>5861.</b>
From all this it is plain that during his life in the world a man is as to his interiors, thus as to his spirit, in company with other spirits, and is so adjoined to them that he cannot think anything 
or will anything except together with them, and that thereby there is a communication of his interiors with the spiritual world, and that in this way and not otherwise can he be led by the Lord. When 
a man comes into the other life he has with him his unbelief in there having been with him any spirit, especially any from hell. There is therefore shown him, if he desires it, the society of spirits 
in whose company he had been, and from which emissary spirits had been with him. And then after passing through some preliminary states, he at last returns to the same society, because this society 
has acted in unity with the love which had obtained the dominion with him. I have sometimes seen their societies shown to them. </p>

From all this it is evident that while a person lives in the world he is so far as his interiors, thus his spirit, are concerned in contact with other spirits. It is evident too that he is linked to 
them in such a way that he cannot think anything, or will it, unless he does so together with them, so that interiorly he is in communication with the spiritual world; and that he cannot be led by the 
Lord in any other way. When a person enters the next life he takes with him his lack of belief that any spirit at all is present with him, let alone one from hell. He is therefore shown, if he so wishes, 
the community of spirits with which he has been in contact and from which the spirits present with him had been sent out. Also, after several states which he must pass through first, he finally returns 
to the same community, because that community had acted in unison with the love in him which has gained control. Several times I have seen people being shown their own communities. </p>

</p><b>5861.</b>
Ex his patet quod homo cum vivit in mundo, quoad interiora sua, ita quoad spiritum suum, sit in consortio cum aliis spiritibus, ac illis ita adjunctus ut non aliquid cogitare possit, nec velle, nisi 
una cum illis, et quod sic communicatio sit interiorum ejus cum mundo spirituali; et quod sic non aliter duci possit a Domino. Homo cum in alteram vitam venit, secum habet incredulitatem quod nullus 
spiritus apud illum fuerit, minus quod aliquis ex inferno, quapropter illi si desiderat, ostenditur societas spirituum in cujus consortio fuerat, et a qua spiritus emissarii apud illum fuerant; etiam 
post aliquot status quos percurret primum, tandem ad eandem societatem redit, quia illa cum ejus amore qui dominium obtinuit, unum egerat: aliquoties vidi quod societates suae ostensae fuerint. </p>
