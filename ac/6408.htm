<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6408节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6408.</strong>“论亚设”表情感所拥有的祝福，也就是说，天上的情感，即对主之爱和对邻之仁的情感所拥有的幸福。这从“亚设”的代表清楚可知，“亚设”是指永生的幸福和情感所拥有的祝福（参看<a href="3938.htm">3938</a>，<a href="3939.htm">3939</a>节）。此外，他还出于“祝福”一词而被称为亚设。这种祝福很难描述，因为它是一种内在祝福，很少从肉体上显明在人里面，因而很难察觉。活在肉身期间，人能清楚地意识到身体里面所发生的事，但只能极其模糊地意识到灵里所发生的事；因为活在肉身期间，世俗的忧虑形成了阻碍。凡这些忧虑存在之处，情感所拥有的祝福都无法流入他的身体觉知，除非属世和感官事物与内层事物一致；即便如此，它也只是一种极其模糊的意识，仅仅是他心满意足所带来的一种平静的感觉。但他死后，这种祝福就会变得明显，被感觉为福分和幸福，既感染他的内层，也感染他的外层。简言之，天上的情感所拥有的祝福是他的灵魂或灵所拥有的，经由一种内在途径流入，一直渗透到身体；在那里只要属世和感官之爱的情感没有阻碍，它就会被接受。<br />这种祝福根本就不存在于那些陷入爱自己爱世界的快乐之人中间，因为这些爱完全是它的对立面。因此，被这些爱所主宰的人根本无法理解除了升职，被崇拜为神明，拥有大量财产，占有比别人更多的财富外，还能有什么祝福存在。如果这些人被告知，源于这些爱的快乐是外在的，会与肉体一道消亡；它留在脑海里的东西死后会转变为诸如地狱所盛行的那种悲伤和阴郁；但有一种内在快乐存在，这种快乐就是诸如天上的人所享有的那种极乐和幸福；他们根本就不明白，因为对他们来说，外在掌权，内在被关闭。由此可见当如何理解情感所拥有的祝福，就是“亚设”所表示的一种祝福。</p>

From Asher. That this signifies the blessedness of the affections, namely, of the celestial affections which are of love to the Lord and of charity toward the neighbor, is evident from the representation 
of Asher, as being the happiness of eternal life, and the blessedness of the affections (see n. 3938, 3939). Moreover Asher was so called from "blessedness." This blessedness cannot be easily described, 
because it is internal, and seldom shows itself with anyone in the very body, thus seldom to the sense. For during his life in the body, man has a distinct sensation of what takes place in his 
body, but a very obscure one of what takes place in his spirit, because while man is in the body worldly cares act as a hindrance, and where these cares exist the blessedness of the affections cannot 
flow so far as into the bodily sense unless natural and sensuous things have been reduced to agreement with inward ones, and even then only obscurely, as a tranquillity from contentment of mind; but 
after departure from this life it manifests itself, and is perceived as something blessed and happy, and then it affects both the interiors and the exteriors. In a word, the blessedness of the celestial 
affections is that of the soul or spirit itself, flowing in by an internal way, and penetrating toward the body, where it is received so far as the delights of natural and sensuous loves do not stand 
in the way. [2] Not a whit of this blessedness is possible with those who are in the delight of the love of self and of the world, for these loves are totally opposite; and therefore they who are 
in these loves cannot at all comprehend that there is any blessedness except that of being exalted to dignities, being worshiped as deities, abounding in riches, and possessing greater wealth than others. 
If they are told that the delight from these loves is external, and perishes with the body, and that what remains in the mind is turned after death into sadness and gloom, such as prevail in the 
hells; and that there is an internal delight which is the satisfaction and happiness enjoyed by those who are in heaven; these things they do not at all comprehend, because the external reigns with them 
and the internal is closed. From all this it may be known what is meant by the blessedness of the affections which is signified by "Asher." </p>

'From Asher' means the blessedness that the affections possess, that is to say, heavenly affections, which are those of love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour. This is clear from the representation 
of 'Asher' as the happiness of eternal life and the blessedness that the affections possess, dealt with in <a href="3938.htm">3938</a>, <a href="3939.htm">3939</a>, in addition to which he was called Asher from a word meaning blessedness. 
As regards that blessedness, it is not easy to describe it, for the reason that it is an inner blessedness, which rarely reveals itself physically in a person and so is rarely perceptible. For while 
a person lives in the body he is distinctly aware of what presents itself in his body, but he is only very dimly aware of what presents itself in his spirit; for while a person is living in his body 
worldly concerns impede his awareness of it. The blessedness that the affections possess cannot flow into his perception in the body where those concerns are centred unless what exists on the natural 
and sensory levels has been brought into agreement with what exists on interior levels; and even then it is only a dim awareness, no more than a calm feeling brought about by his contented state of 
mind. But after he has died that blessedness makes itself plain and is felt to be blessing and happiness, which affect him both interiorly and exteriorly. In short the blessedness that heavenly affections 
possess is that which his soul or spirit possesses, flowing in by an interior route and reaching through to the body, where it is received to the extent that the delights springing from the loves 
that belong to the natural and the senses do not stand in the way. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This blessedness does not exist in any way at all with those whose delight is that of self-love and love of the world; for these 
loves are quite the opposite of it. People ruled by these loves therefore are not at all able to understand how any blessedness can exist apart from that of being promoted to important positions, 
being venerated as if they were gods, having an abundance of riches, and possessing more wealth than others. And if these people are told that the delight that springs from those loves is external and 
perishes along with the body, and that what remains of it in the mind is turned after death into a miserable and hideous delight, such as exists with those in hell, but that an internal kind of delight 
exists, and that this is a blissful and happy one such as exists with those in heaven, they do not comprehend these things at all, for the reason that with them the external holds sway and the internal 
is closed. From all this one may see how to understand 'the blessedness that the affections possess', a blessedness meant by 'Asher'. </p>

`Ab Ashere': quod significet beatum affectionum, nempe caelestium quae sunt amoris in Dominum et charitatis erga proximum, constat ex repraesentatione `Asheris' quod sit felicitas vitae aeternae, et 
beatum affectionum, de qua n. 3938, 3939; Asher etiam a beatitudine dictus est.  Quod beatitudinem illam attinet, illa non facile describi potest ex causa quia est interna, et raro apud aliquem in ipsum 
corpus se exserit, ita raro ad sensum; homo enim dum in corpore vivit, distincte sentit illa quae existunt in corpore, sed obscurissime illa quae existunt in ejus spiritu, mundanae enim curae, cum 
homo in corpore est, impediunt; usque in sensum corporis ubi illae curae sunt, beatum affectionum non influere potest, nisi naturalia et sensualia ad concordantiam cum interioribus redacta fuerint, et 
usque nec tunc nisi obscure, modo sicut tranquillum ex eo quod contentus animo sit, at post obitum se id manifestat, ac percipitur ut beatum et felix, et tunc afficit et interiora et exteriora; verbo, 
beatum affectionum caelestium est ipsius animae seu spiritus, influens per viam internam et penetrans versus corpus, ubi recipitur quantum jucunda amorum naturalium et sensualium non obstant.  [2] 
Hoc beatum ne hilum datur apud illos qui in jucundo amoris sui et mundi sunt, nam hi amores prorsus {1}oppositi sunt; quapropter etiam illi qui in his amoribus sunt, nequaquam comprehendere possunt quod 
{2}aliquid beatum detur quam evehi ad {3}dignitates, coli sicut nomina, divitiis abundare, et possidere opes prae aliis; si illis dicitur quod jucundum ex his amoribus externum sit, et cum corpore 
pereat, et quod inde remanet in animo, post obitum vertatur in triste et tetrum, quale illis {4}in infernis, et quod jucundum internum detur, et quod hoc sit faustum et felix quod illis qui in caelo; 
haec prorsus non capiunt, {5}ex causa quia apud illos externum regnat et internum clausum est. Ex his sciri potest quid intelligitur per beatum affectionum quod significatur per `Asherem'. @1 in opposito$ @2
