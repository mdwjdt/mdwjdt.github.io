<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6325节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6325.</strong>这是一个永恒的真理：主掌管天堂和大地，除主之外没有人靠自己存活，或说自我存在；因此，一切生命都是流入的；充满良善的生命是从主流入的，充满邪恶的生命是从地狱流入的。这就是众天堂的信仰；一旦一个人处于这种信仰（当他处于良善时，便处于这种信仰），邪恶就无法粘附在他身上，被当成他自己的而归于他；因为他知道邪恶并非源于他自己，而是源于地狱。当一个人处于这种状态时，平安就能被赋予他，因为他唯独信靠主。除了那些拥有源于仁爱的信仰之人外，平安无法被赋予其他任何人；因为其他人不断将自己扔进产生不安感觉的焦虑和恶欲中。那些想要自我引导的人以为这种状态等于丧失了自己的意愿，从而丧失了自己的自由，因而丧失了一切快乐，由此丧失了一切生命及其甜蜜。他们之所以这样说，这样想，是因为他们不知道事情的真相；这真相就是：被主引导的人享有真正的自由，因而享有真正的快乐和幸福。良善和真理被归于他；行善的情感和渴望被赋予他；在这种情况下，再没有比发挥功用或说履行有用的服务更令他们快乐的了；对良善的觉知，以及对它的感觉被赋予他；聪明和智慧被赋予他；所有这些东西如同他自己的。因为当被主引导时，他就是主生命的接受者。在学术界，众所周知，主因和工具因作为一体共同起作用。人因是接受主生命的一种形式，故为工具因；而来自主的生命为主因。工具因感觉这生命如同它自己的，事实上，这生命并非它自己的。</p>

It is an eternal truth that the Lord rules heaven and earth, and also that no one besides the Lord lives of himself, consequently that everything of life flows in-the good of life from the Lord, and 
the evil of life from hell. This is the faith of the heavens. When a man is in this faith (and he can be in it when he is in good), then evil cannot be fastened and appropriated to him, because he knows 
that it is not from himself, but from hell. When a man is in this state, he can then be gifted with peace, for then he will trust solely in the Lord. Neither can peace be given to any others than those 
who are in this faith from charity; for others continually cast themselves into anxieties and cupidities, whence come disquietudes. Spirits who desire to direct themselves, suppose that this would 
be to lose their own will, thus their freedom, consequently all delight, thus all life and its sweetness. This they say and suppose, because they do not know how the case really is; for the man who 
is led by the Lord is in freedom itself, and thus in delight and bliss itself; goods and truths are appropriated to him; there is given him an affection and desire for doing what is good, and then nothing 
is more delightful to him than to perform uses. There is given him a perception of good, and also a sensation of it; and there is given him intelligence and wisdom; and all these as his own; for 
he is then a recipient of the Lord's life. It is known in the learned world that the principal cause and the instrumental cause act together as a one: man, being a form recipient of the Lord's life, is 
an instrumental cause, and the life from the Lord is the principal cause. This life is felt in the instrumental cause as of it, when yet it is not of it. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6325</b></p><p><b>6325.</b>
It is an eternal truth that the Lord rules over heaven and earth, also that no one apart from the Lord is self-existent, consequently that all life flows in - life filled with goodness flowing in from 
the Lord, life filled with evil flowing in from hell. This is what they believe in the heavens; and when a person shares their belief, which he is able to do when he is governed by good, evil cannot 
be attached to him or be accepted by him as his own because he knows that it does not originate in himself but in hell. When this is a person's state peace can be granted to him, for he trusts solely 
in the Lord. Nor can peace be granted to anyone else but those who have that faith springing from charity; for others constantly plunge themselves into anxious cares and evil desires that give rise to 
feelings of unease. Spirits who wish to govern themselves imagine that that state would amount to a loss of their own will, thus of their freedom, consequently of all delight, thus of all life and its 
sweetness. They say and imagine this because they do not know the real truth of the matter, which is that one who is led by the Lord enjoys true freedom, and so true delight and bliss. Forms of good 
and truths are assigned to him as his own; an affection and desire to do good are imparted to him, in which case nothing gives him greater happiness than the performance of useful services; a perception 
of what is good is imparted to him, also a sensation of it; and intelligence and wisdom are imparted to him. And all these things that he is given feel as though they are his own. For when led by 
the Lord he is a recipient of the Lord's life. It is well known in the world of learning that a principal cause and an instrumental cause act together as a single cause. Now since man is a form receptive 
of the Lord's life, he is the instrumental cause, whereas the life from the Lord is the principal cause. This life is felt by the instrumental cause to be its own, when in fact it is not its own. </p>

</p><b>6325.</b>
Est aeterna veritas quod Dominus regat caelum et terram, tum quod nullus a se vivat praeter Dominum, consequenter quod omne vitae influat, vitae bonum a Domino, et vitae malum ab inferno; haec fides 
caelorum est; cum homo est in fide illa, in qua potest esse cum in bono, tunc ei malum non potest affigi et appropriari, quia novit quod non a se sed ab inferno; cum homo in hoc statu est, tunc potest 
donari pace, nam tunc unice fidet Domino; nec pax aliis dari potest quam qui in fide illa ex charitate sunt, nam alii conjiciunt se continue in sollicitudines et cupiditates a quibus intranquillitates. 
 Putant spiritus qui semet regere volunt, quod id foret amittere suum voluntarium, ita liberum, consequenter omne jucundum, ita omnem vitam et ejus suavitatem; hoc dicunt et putant quia non sciunt 
quomodo se res habet; homo enim qui ducitur a Domino, is in ipso libero est, et sic in ipso jucundo et beato; appropriantur ei bona et vera, datur ei affectio et desiderium faciendi bonum, ei tunc nihil 
ei felicius est quam usus praestare; datur ei perceptio boni, etiam sensatio ejus, et datur ei intelligentia et sapientia; et haec omnia sicut ejus propria; nam tunc est recipiens vitae Domini.  Notum 
est in orbe erudito quod causa principalis et instrumentalis simul unam causam agat; homo quia est forma recipiens vitae Domina, est causa instrumentalis, (x)vita autem ex Domino est causa principalis, 
haec vita sentitur in instrumentali sicut ejus, cum tamen non est ejus. </p>
