<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1078节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1078.</strong>如前所述，“迦南的父亲”表脱离内在敬拜的外在敬拜。从脱离仁爱之信中不可能产生其它敬拜；因为内在人是仁爱，绝不是无仁之信。所以，凡丧失仁爱的人只会有缺乏内在的外在敬拜。由于这类敬拜产生于脱离仁爱之信，故含被称为“迦南的父亲”，下文不再论述含，而是论述迦南。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1078.</strong> The symbolism of father of Canaan as an outward show of worship without inward content has been mentioned before [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1078/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1063" target=_top>1063</a>]. Faith detached from charity can produce no other kind of worship, because the inner self consists in charity, never in faith without charity. So people devoid of neighborly love are completely incapable of any other type of worship than an outward show without inward content. Since it is faith detached from neighborly love that produces this sort of worship, Ham is called Canaan's father, and the following verses speak not of Ham but of Canaan. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1078</b></p><p><b>1078.</b>
That the "father of Canaan" signifies worship in externals without internal worship, has been stated before. From faith separated from charity no other worship can come forth; for the internal man is 
charity, never faith without charity; so that he who is destitute of charity can have no other worship than external worship without internal. And because such worship comes forth from faith separated 
from charity, Ham is called "the father of Canaan" and in what follows Ham is not treated of, but Canaan. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1078</b></p><p><b>1078.</b>
That 'the father of Canaan' means worship in external things devoid of internal has been discussed already. From faith separated from charity no other kind of worship can possibly arise. Indeed the internal 
man is charity, and never faith devoid of charity. This is why the person who is destitute of charity cannot possibly have any other kind of worship than external devoid of internal. And because 
it is from faith separated from charity that such worship arises, Ham was called 'the father of Canaan', and in what follows Ham is not the subject, but Canaan. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1078</b>
</p><b>1078.</b>
Quod 'pater Canaanis' significet cultum in externis absque interno, prius dictum est; ex fide separata a charitate non alius cultus potest existere; internus enim homo est charitas, nusquam fides absque 
charitate; quare qui charitate destitutus, nusquam alium cultum a charitate talis existit cultus, Ham vocatus 'pater Canaanis,' et in potest habere quam externam absque interno; et quia ex fide separata 
sequentibus non de Hamo sed de Canaane agitur. </p>
