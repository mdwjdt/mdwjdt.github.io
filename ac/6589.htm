<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6589节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6589.</strong>“领你们从这地上去，到祂起誓所应许给亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各之地”表他们即将进入古人所在的教会状态。这从“埃及地”和“迦南地”的含义清楚可知：他们要从“埃及地”上去，“埃及地”是指已荒凉的教会，埃及人压迫以色列人就代表教会已经荒凉，埃及人被淹死在红海中代表它的灭亡；以色列人所要“上去”的“迦南地”是指主的国度和教会（参看<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="3038.htm">3038</a>，<a href="3481.htm">3481</a>，<a href="3705.htm">3705</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="4517.htm">4517</a>节）。<br />“神起誓所应许给亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各之地”表示古人所在的古教会，或该教会的状态；因为这三个人在至高意义上表示主，在代表意义上表示祂在天上的国，以及祂在地上的国，也就是教会（参看<a href="1965.htm">1965</a>，<a href="1989.htm">1989</a>，<a href="2011.htm">2011</a>，<a href="3245.htm">3245</a>，<a href="3305.htm">3305</a>e，<a href="6098.htm">6098</a>，<a href="6185.htm">6185</a>，<a href="6276.htm">6276</a>节）。因此，“起誓应许给他们”表示确认他们要进入古人所在的教会状态。并不是说雅各的后代即将进入该状态，因为他们不能进入这个教会的状态，只能进入该教会的外在，也就是它的代表行为，然而也几乎没有进行这些行为；相反，所作的应许是给“以色列人”在灵性上所表示的那些人，他们全都是属灵教会的成员，既包括那时已在属灵教会的人，也包括那些将要进入该教会的人。<br />“起誓”表示出于神性的确认（参看<a href="2842.htm">2842</a>，<a href="3375.htm">3375</a>节）。迦南地被应许给雅各的后代，是为了叫他们能代表教会；原因在于，自古时起，教会就存在于那地；那时，那里的所有地方都有了名字，并成为代表（<a href="3686.htm">3686</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="4516.htm">4516</a>，<a href="4517.htm">4517</a>，<a href="5135.htm">5135</a>，<a href="6516.htm">6516</a>节）。</p>

And will make you go up out of this land unto the land which He sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. That this signifies that they will come to the state of the church in which the ancients were, 
is evident from the signification of the "land of Egypt," from which they were to "go up," as being the vastated church, which was represented by the Egyptians oppressing the sons of Israel; and its 
destruction, by their being overwhelmed in the sea Suph; and from the signification of the "land of Canaan," to which the sons of Israel were to "go up," as being the Lord's kingdom and church (see n. 
1607, 3038, 3481, 3705, 4447, 4517). [2] That this is the Ancient Church, or the state of the church in which were the ancients, is signified by its being designated as the "land which God sware to 
give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob;" for by these in the supreme sense is meant the Lord, and in the representative sense His kingdom in the heavens, and His kingdom on the earth, which is the church 
(see n. 1965, 1989, 2011, 3245, 3305, 6098, 6185, 6276). Thus "to swear to give the land to them," is to confirm that they shall come to the state of the church in which the ancients were. Not that 
the posterity of Jacob were to come thereto, for they could not come to the state of that church, but only to its external, namely, to representatives, and scarcely to these; but that they should 
come thereto who are signified by the "sons of Israel," who are all those who are of the spiritual church, both those who then had been, and those who were to come. (That "to swear" denotes to confirm 
from the Divine, may be seen, n. 2842, 3375.) The reason why the land of Canaan was promised and given to the descendants of Jacob, was that they might represent the church; and this because from ancient 
times the church had been in that land, and at that time all the places in it were named and made representative (n. 3686, 4447, 4516, 4517, 5135, 6516). </p>

'And cause you to go up out of this land to the land which He swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob' means that they are about to come into the state of the Church that the ancients lived in. This is clear 
from the meaning of 'the land of Egypt', from which they were to go up, as the Church when it has been laid waste - the Church laid waste was represented by the Egyptians through their oppression 
of the children of Israel, and the perishing of it through their drowning in the Sea Suph; and from the meaning of 'the land of Canaan', to which the children of Israel were about to go up, as the Lord's 
kingdom and the Church, dealt within <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>, <a href="3038.htm">3038</a>, <a href="3481.htm">3481</a>, <a href="3705.htm">3705</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="4517.htm">4517</a>. </p>

 The Ancient Church, or the state of the Church in which the ancients lived, is what is meant by God's having sworn to 
give that land to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. These three are used to mean in the highest sense the Lord, and in the representative sense His kingdom in heaven and His kingdom on earth, which is the 
Church, <a href="1965.htm">1965</a>, <a href="1989.htm">1989</a>, <a href="2011.htm">2011</a>, <a href="3245.htm">3245</a>, <a href="3305.htm">3305</a> (end), <a href="6098.htm">6098</a>, <a href="6185.htm">6185</a>, <a href="6276.htm">6276</a>; therefore 'swearing the land to them' means confirming that they are about to come into the state of the Church that the ancients lived in. 
Not that the descendants of Jacob were about to do so, for they were incapable of coming into the state of that Church; they came into no more than the external aspect of that Church, that is to say, 
its representative acts, yet barely into these. The promise that is made refers instead to those who are meant spiritually by 'the children of Israel', that is, who are all members of the spiritual 
Church - both those who lived in it at that time and those who were about to come into it. </p>

 'Swearing' means confirmation from the Divine, see <a href="1842.htm">1842</a>, <a href="3375.htm">3375</a>. </p>
<p>The land of Canaan was promised and 
given to the descendants of Jacob so that they might represent the Church; and the reason for this was that the Church had existed in that land since ancient times, during which all the places there received 
their names and became representative, see <a href="3686.htm">3686</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="4516.htm">4516</a>, <a href="4517.htm">4517</a>, <a href="5136.htm">5136</a>, <a href="6516.htm">6516</a>. </p>

`Et ascendere faciet vos e terra hac ad terram quam juravit Abrahamo, Jischako et Jacobo':  quod significet quod ad statum  Ecclesiae venturi in quo fuerunt antiqui, constat ex significatione  `terrae 
{1} Aegypti e qua ascenderent, quod sit Ecclesia vastata, hanc repraesentabant Aegyptii per quod oppresserunt filios Israelis, et interitum ejus per submersionem eorum in mare Suph; et a significatione 
`terrae Canaanis' ad quam filii Israelis ascensuri, quod sit regnum Domini et Ecclesia, de qua n. 1607, 3038, 3481, 3705, 4447, 4517; [2]quod sit Ecclesia Antiqua, seu status Ecclesiae in quo fuerunt 
antiqui, significatur per quod Deus terram illam dare juraverit Abrahamo, Jischako et Jacobo, nam per hos in sensu supremo intelligitur Dominus, in sensu repraesentativo regnum Ipsius in caelis et 
regnum Ipsius in terris quod est Ecclesia, n. 1965, 1989, 2011, 3245, 3305 fin., 6098, 6185, 6276, quare `jurare illis terram' est confirmare quod ad statum Ecclesiae in quo fuerunt antiqui, venturi; 
non quod posteri Jacobi, nam illi non ad illius Ecclesiae statum venire potuerunt, sed solum ad externum ejus, nempe ad repraesentativa, et vix ad ea, sed quod illi qui significantur per `filios Israelis', 
qui sunt omnes qui ab Ecclesia spirituali sunt, tam qui tunc fuerunt quam qui venturi.  [3]Quod `jurare' sit confirmare ex Divino, videatur n. 2842, 3375: quod posteris Jacobi terra Canaan promissa 
et data fuerit, {2}erat ut repraesentarent Ecclesiam; et hoc quia Ecclesia ab antiquis temporibus in terra illa fuerat, et {3}tunc omnia illa loca nominata et facta repraesentativa, videatur n.
