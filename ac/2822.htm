<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2822节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2822.</strong>“亚伯拉罕！亚伯拉罕！他说，我在这里”表试探过后在理性的神圣良善中发觉安慰。这从“说”的含义清楚可知，在圣言的历史部分，“说”是指发觉，如前面频繁所述。此处之所以在理性的神圣良善中发觉，是因为“亚伯拉罕”在此表主的理性或人性里面的神圣良善。至于什么叫在理性的神圣良善里面发觉，这无法解释清楚。因为在解释它之前，我们必须通过了解许多事对主的神性人形成一个概念。若没有这样一个概念，所解释的一切事都会落入空洞或模糊的观念中，这些观念要么败坏真理，要么将真理带入不一致的事物中。<br />本节论述的是主经历试探后的第一状态，也就是安慰的状态。正因如此，经上没有再提及“神”这个名，而是提到了“耶和华”。当论述真理时，经上用“神”这个名；而当论述安慰所源于的良善时，则用“耶和华”这个名（<a href="2769.htm">2769</a>节）。试探后的一切安慰都被注入良善，因为良善是一切喜乐的源头，这喜乐从良善传到真理。因此，“亚伯拉罕”在此表示理性的神圣良善，如他在其它地方，以及凡“耶和华”这个名出现同一节的地方所表示的那样。</p>

And said, Abraham, Abraham; and he said, Here am I. That this signifies a perception of consolation in the Divine Good of the rational after temptation, is evident from the signification of "saying" 
in the historical parts of the Word, as being to perceive-explained often before. That it is here perception in the Divine Good of the rational, is because the Divine Good of the rational of the Lord's 
Human is here signified by "Abraham." What perception in the Divine Good of the rational is, cannot be unfolded to the apprehension; for before it is unfolded, an idea of the Lord's Divine Human must 
have been formed from knowledge of many things; and before this has been formed, all things belonging to the explication would fall into empty and obscure ideas, which would either pervert the truths 
or bring them into things incongruous. In this verse the Lord's first state after temptation is treated of, which is a state of consolation; on which account it is now no longer said "God," but "Jehovah;" 
for "God" is named when truth is treated of, but "Jehovah" when good is treated of, from which comes consolation (n. 2769). All consolation after temptation is insinuated into good, for from good 
is all joy; and from the good it passes into truth. On this account by "Abraham" is here signified the Divine good of the rational, as in other places also, and also whenever "Jehovah" is named in 
the same verse. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2822</b></p><p><b>2822.</b>
'And said, Abraham, Abraham. And he said, Here I am' means a perception of comfort in the Divine Good of the Rational following temptation. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'saying' in historical 
parts of the Word as perceiving, often dealt with already. The reason why here it is a perception in the Divine Good of the Rational is that 'Abraham' here means the Divine Good within the Lord's Rational 
or Human. What perception in the Divine Good of the Rational is cannot be explained intelligibly, for prior to any explanation of it an idea of the Lord's Divine Human must be formed from knowledge 
of many things. Until such an idea has been formed all things offered by way of explanation would fall into ideas that were either empty or obscure, which would either pervert truths or bring these 
among ideas out of keeping with them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In this verse the Lord's first state following temptation is the subject, which is a state of comfort. This explains why the name God is not now used any 
more but Jehovah, for God is used when reference is being made to the truth from which the battle is fought, but Jehovah when reference is being made to the good from which comfort springs, <a href="2769.htm">2769</a>. All 
comfort following temptation is instilled into good, for good is the source of all joy, and from the good it passes over into truth. Here therefore 'Abraham' means the Divine Good of the Rational, 
as he also does in other places, and wherever the name Jehovah occurs in the same verse. </p>

`Et dixit, Abraham, Abraham; et dixit, Ecce ego': quod significet perceptionem consolationis in Divino Bono Rationalis post tentationem, constare potest a significatione `dicere' in historicis Verbi 
quod sit percipere, de qua saepius prius; hic quod sit perceptio in Divino Bono Rationalis, inde est quia hic per `Abrahamum' significatur Divinum Bonum Rationalis seu Humani Domini. Quid sit perceptio 
in Divino Bono Rationalis, non ad captum explicari potest; antequam enim explicatur, formata erit idea de Divino Humano Domini ex cognitione plurium, quae antequam formata est, caderent omnia quae 
explicationis essent, in ideas vel vacuas vel obscuras quae vera vel perverterent vel inferrent incongruis. In hoc versu de primo statu post tentationem Domini agitur, qui est status consolationis, quare 
nunc non amplius dicitur Deus, sed Jehovah; Deus enim dicitur cum agitur de vero ex quo pugna, Jehovah autem cum de bono ex quo consolatio, n. 2769; omnis consolatio post tentationem insinuatur {1}in 
bonum, nam ex bono omne gaudium; ex bono transit in verum; hic ideo per `Abrahamum' significatur Divinum Bonum Rationalis, ut alibi etiam passim, et tunc cum Jehovah in eodem versu nominatur. @1 per$ </p>
