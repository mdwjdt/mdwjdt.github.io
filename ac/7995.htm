<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7995节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7995.</strong>“逾越节的例是这样”表为那些从诅咒和侵扰中被释放的人所立的秩序律法。这从“例”和“逾越节”的含义清楚可知：“例”是指出于秩序的东西，如下文所述；“逾越节”是指主的同在和从诅咒中所得的释放（参看<a href="7093.htm">7093</a>e，<a href="7867.htm">7867</a>节）。至于“例”所表示的出于秩序的东西，要知道，吩咐给以色列人的一切条例都是外在形式上的秩序律法，但它们所代表并表示的那些事物却是内在形式上的秩序律法，而秩序律法是源于良善的真理。一切秩序律法的复合整体就是从主的神性良善发出的神性真理。由此明显可知，在天堂，主的神性本身就是秩序，神性良善是秩序的内在本质，而神性真理是它的外在形式。</p>

This is the statute of the passover. That this signifies the laws of order for those who are liberated from damnation and infestations, is evident from the signification of a "statute," as being that 
which is from order (of which below); and from the signification of "the passover," as being the presence of the Lord and liberation from damnation (see n. 7093e, 7867). As regards that which is of order, 
which is signified by "statute," be it known that all the statutes commanded to the sons of Israel were laws of order in the external form, but those things which they represented and signified 
were laws of order in the internal form. Laws of order are truths which are from good; the complex of all the laws of order is the Divine truth proceeding from the Divine good of the Lord. From this it 
is evident that the Divine Itself of the Lord in heaven is order, the Divine good the essential of order, and the Divine truth its formal. </p>

This is the statute of the Passover' means the laws of order for those who have been delivered from damnation and molestations. This is clear from the meaning of 'the statute' as that which arises from 
order, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'the Passover' as the Lord's presence and deliverance from damnation, dealt with in <a href="7097.htm">7097</a> (end), <a href="7867.htm">7867</a> As regards that which arises from order, meant 
by 'the statute', it should be recognized that all the statutes which the children of Israel were commanded were the laws of order in their outward form, while the realities which those statutes were 
representations and meaningful signs of were the laws of order in their inward form, laws of order being truths deriving from good. The complex whole to which all the laws of order belong is Divine Truth 
emanating from the Lord's Divine Good. From this it is evident that in heaven order consists in what is completely Divine and the Lord's, Divine Good being the inner essence of order and Divine Truth 
its outward form. </p>

`Hoc statutum Paesach': quod significet leges ordinis illis qui a damnatione et infestationibus liberati, constat ex significatione `statuti' quod sit {1}id quod ex ordine, de qua sequitur; et ex significatione 
`Paesach' quod sit praesentia Domini et liberatio a damnatione, de qua n. 7093 fin., 7867.  Quod {2}id quod ordinis est, quod per statutum significatur, attinet, sciendum quod omnia statuta 
quae mandata sunt filiis Israelis fuerint leges ordinis in forma externa, at illa quae repraesentabant et significabant erant leges ordinis in forma interna; leges ordinis sunt {3} vera quae ex bono; 
complexus omnium legum ordinis est Divinum Verum procedens a Divino Bono Domini; inde patet quod Ipsum Divinum Domini in caelo sit ordo, Divinum Bonum essentiale ordinis, ac {4}Divinum Verum formale 
ejus. 	@1 ordo$ 	@2 ordinem attinet, qui per statutum significatur$ 	@3 i omnia$ 	@4 Divina vera formalia ejus, haec quoque vocantur leges ordinis, et quae in externis repraesentabant illa, vocabantur statuta$ </p>
