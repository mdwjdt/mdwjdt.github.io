<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第928节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>928.</strong>“因为人心的妄想从小就是邪恶”表人心智的意愿部分全然是恶。这一点从刚才所述清楚可知。“人心的妄想”没有其它意思。人以为自己有对良善的意愿，其实他大错特错了。他行善并非凭自己的意愿，而是凭一个新的意愿，这新意愿是主的，因此，他是通过主而行善的。同样，他思想和言说真理是凭着一个新的觉知，这新觉知来自新意愿，因而他是通过主这样做的。因为人若重生，就是一个被主形成的全新之人，这也是为何他被说成新造的原因。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]928.</strong> The meaning of what human hearts fabricate is evil from their youth as the fact that the volitional side of the human mind is completely evil is established by the statements just above; what the heart fabricates has no other meaning.<br />We think that we have a will to do good, but we are wholly mistaken. When we do good, it is not our will but a new will that is the Lord's — and so the Lord himself — that moves us to do so. By the same token, when we think and speak what is true, the source is a new intellectual capacity coming out of the new will and so the Lord again. People who have been reborn are entirely new people, formed by the Lord, so they are said to be created anew.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The phrase "created anew" here may be an allusion to <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_928/bible_king-james-version_2-corinthians_5_17" target=_top>2 Corinthians 5:17</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_928/bible_king-james-version_galatians_6_15" target=_top>Galatians 6:15</a>.

Because the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth. That this signifies that man's will part is utterly evil, is evident from what has just been said. The "imagination of the heart" signifies 
nothing else. Man supposes that he has a will for what is good, but he is quite mistaken. When he does good, it is not from his will, but from a new will which is the Lord's; thus it is from the Lord 
that he does it. Consequently when he thinks and speaks what is true, it is from a new understanding, which is from the new will, and it is from the Lord that he does this also. For the regenerate 
man is an altogether new man formed by the Lord, and this is why he is said to be created anew. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 928</b></p><p><b>928.</b>
'The imagination of man's heart is evil from his childhood' means that the will part of man's mind is totally evil. This is clear from what has just been stated. 'The imagination of the heart' has no 
other meaning. Man supposes that he has a will for good, but in this he is utterly mistaken. When he does good, he does not act from his own will but from the new will which is the Lord's, and thus from 
the Lord. Likewise when he thinks and utters what is true, he speaks from the new understanding deriving from that new will, and so again from the Lord. For one who has been regenerated is an entirely 
new person who has been formed by the Lord. This also is why he is said to have been created anew. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 928</b>
</p><b>928.</b>
Quod 'figmentum cordis hominis malum a pueritia ejus significet quod voluntarium hominis sit prorsus malum, ex illis quae nunc dicta sunt, constat; 'figmentum cordis' non aliud significat Homo putat 
se habere voluntatem boni sed prorsus fallitur; cum bonum facit, non est ex ejus voluntate sed est ex nova voluntate quae est Domini, ita ex Domino; proinde cum verum cogitat et loquitur est ex novo intellectu 
qui est inde, et sic quoque ex Domino; nam regeneratus est prorsus novus homo formatus a Domino, inde quoque dicitur e novo creatus. </p>
