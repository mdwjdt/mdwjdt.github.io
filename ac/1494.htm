<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1494.</strong>创世记12:19. 为什么说她是你的妹子？以致我把她取来要作我的妻子。现在，看哪，你的妻子；带她走吧。<br />“为什么说她是你的妹子”表那时祂不知道别的，只知道祂拥有智性真理。“以致我把她取来要作我的妻子”表祂因此可能已向要与属天之物联结的真理施暴。“现在，看哪，你的妻子；带她走吧”表那真理要与属天之物联结。</p><br />

"Why did you say, 钬楽he is my sister'? And I would have taken her for my woman. And now look: your wife; take her and go."<br />Why did you say, "She is my sister"? means that at the time he was not aware of possessing anything but intuitive truth. And I would have taken her for my woman means that in his ignorance he could have abused the truth that was to be wedded to a heavenly quality. And now look: your wife; take her and go, means that the truth would be wedded to a heavenly quality. </p>

Verse 19. Why saidst thou, She is my sister? and I might have taken her to me for a woman. And now behold thy wife; take her and go. "Why saidst thou, She is my sister?" signifies that He then knew no 
otherwise than that He had intellectual truth; "and I might have taken her to me for a woman," signifies that so He might have done violence to the truth that was to be conjoined with what is celestial; 
"and now behold thy wife; take her and go," signifies that truth was to be conjoined with what is celestial. </p>

Verse 19 Why did you say, She is my sister? I might have taken her to be my wife (mulier). And now, behold your wife, take her and go. </p>
<p>'Why did you say, She is my sister?' means that He knew no other 
at that time than that He possessed intellectual truth. 'I might have taken her to be my wife (mulier)' means that this being so He could have done violence to the truth that was to be joined to what 
is celestial. 'And now, behold your wife, take her and go' means that truth was to be joined to what is celestial. </p>

</p><b>1494.</b>
Vers. 19.  Quare dixisti, Soror mea illa? et accepissem illam mihi in mulierem; et nunc, ecce uxor tua, accipe et vade. 'Quare dixisti, soror mea illa' significat quod non aliud tunc nosset quam quod 
intellectuale verum haberet: 'et accepissem illam mihi in mulierem' significat quod sic violare potuisset verum quod conjungeretur caelesti: 'et nunc ecce uxor tua, accipe et vade' significat quod conjungeretur 
verum caelesti. </p>
