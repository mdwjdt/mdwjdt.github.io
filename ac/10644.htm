<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10644节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10644</strong>.“砍掉他们的小树林”表必须彻底弃绝他们的教义。这从“小树林”的含义清楚可知，“小树林”是指教会的教义，在此是指偶像崇拜者所信奉的那种宗教的教义，它们是由邪恶所产生的虚假构成的教义。“小树林”之所以表示教义，是因为“树木”表示对良善和真理的觉察或意识；对那些在主的属天国度的人来说，“树木”表示觉察；对那些在主的属灵国度的人来说，“树木”表示意识；每种树都表示一种特定的觉察或意识。这解释了为什么“伊甸园”和其它“园子”表示天上的聪明和智慧；“森林”表示属世人所记忆知识。由此可见为何“小树林”表示教义，又为何古人在小树林中举行神圣的敬拜。因为古人当中的教会都是代表性的，其一切外在形式或外在事物都代表诸如在天堂里的那类内在事物，这些事物都与对主的爱和信有关，与诸如属于爱和信的那类事物有关。小树林、森林、园子、伊甸园，以及树木按照其种类表示这类事物的原因在于来世的代表物。这类事物照着天使的聪明和智慧而出现在那里，因为那里的表象来自一个属天或属灵的源头。“小树林”表示教义，古人在小树林中举行神圣的敬拜（参看<a href="2722.htm">2722</a>，<a href="4552.htm">4552</a>节）；“伊甸园”表示天上的聪明和智慧（<a href="3220.htm">3220</a>，<a href="4528.htm">4528</a>，<a href="4529.htm">4529</a>节）；“园子”也是（<a href="100.htm">100</a>，<a href="108.htm">108</a>，<a href="1588.htm">1588</a>，<a href="2722.htm">2722</a>节）；“森林”表示属世人所拥有的记忆知识（<a href="9011.htm">9011</a>e节）；“树木”表示对良善和真理的觉察和意识或认知（<a href="103.htm">103</a>，<a href="2163.htm">2163</a>，<a href="2682.htm">2682</a>，<a href="2972.htm">2972</a>，<a href="7692.htm">7692</a>，<a href="8326.htm">8326</a>节）。古教会照着这些所具有的含义而在小树林和树下的园子里举行敬拜（<a href="2722.htm">2722</a>，<a href="4552.htm">4552</a>节）。</p>

And ye shall cut down their groves. That this signifies that their teachings must be utterly rejected, is evident from the signification of "groves," as being the doctrinal things of the church, here 
of the religious persuasion among idolaters, which are the teachings of falsity from evil. That "groves" signify teachings is because "trees" signify the perceptions and knowledges of good and truth; 
perceptions, with those who are in the Lord's celestial kingdom; and knowledges with those who are in His spiritual kingdom; and each species of tree signifies a species of perception and knowledge. 
From this it is that "paradises" and "gardens" signify heavenly intelligence and wisdom; and "forests," the memory-knowledge of the natural man. From all this it can be seen whence it is that "groves" 
signify doctrine, and whence it is that the ancients held holy worship in groves. For the church among the ancients was representative, all the external things of which represented internal things such 
as are in heaven, concerning the Lord, concerning love and faith in Him, and concerning such things as are of love and faith. This signification of "groves," and of "forests," "gardens," and "paradises," 
and likewise of "trees" according to their species, originates in the representatives in the other life; for such things appear there in accordance with the intelligence and wisdom of the angels, 
the appearances there being from a celestial and spiritual origin. That "groves" signify doctrine, and that the ancients held holy worship in groves (see n. 2722, 4552): That "paradises" signify heavenly 
intelligence and wisdom (n. 3220, 4528, 4529); and "gardens" in like manner (n. 100, 108, 1588, 2722): That "forests" signify the memory-knowledge which is of the natural man (n. 9011): That "trees" 
signify perceptions and knowledges of good and truth (n. 103, 2163, 2682, 2972, 7692, 8326): That the Ancient Church held worship in groves, and in gardens under trees, according to the significations 
of these (n. 2722, 4552). </p>

'And tear down their groves' means that their teachings are to be totally rejected. This is clear from the meaning of 'groves' as the teachings of the Church, at this point the teachings of the type 
of religion that is practised by idolaters, which are teachings that consist of falsity arising from evil. The reason why teachings are meant by 'groves' is that instances of perception or awareness of 
what is good and true are meant by 'trees', of perception among those who are in the Lord's celestial kingdom, and of awareness among those who are in His spiritual kingdom; and each species of a tree 
means a specific kind of perception or awareness. This accounts for the meaning of 'paradise gardens' and other 'gardens' as heavenly intelligence and wisdom, and for that of 'forests' as the knowledge 
which the natural man possesses. From all this it may be recognized why it is that teachings are meant by 'groves', and why it was that the ancients performed holy acts of worship in groves. For 
the Church among the ancients was a representative one, all of whose outward forms represented inner realities, such as they are in heaven, which have regard to the Lord, to love for Him and faith in 
Him, and to such things as are aspects of love and faith. The reason why groves, and also forests, gardens, and paradise gardens, as well as trees according to their species, mean such things lies in 
representative objects in the next life. The angels' intelligence and wisdom determine what kinds of objects appear there; for whatever makes its appearance has a celestial or spiritual origin.  </p>

`Et lucos ejus exscindetis':  quod significet quod doctrinalia eorum prorsus rejicienda, constat ex significatione `lucorum' quod sint doctrinalia Ecclesiae, hic doctrinalia religiosi apud idololatras, 
quae sunt doctrinalia falsi ex malo; quod `luci' significent {1}doctrinalia, est quia `arbores' significant perceptiones et cognitiones boni et veri, perceptiones apud illos qui in regno caelesti 
Domini sunt, et cognitiones apud illos qui in regno spirituali Ipsius; et unaquaevis species arboris speciem perceptionis ac cognitionis; inde est quod `paradisi' et `horti' significent intelligentiam 
et sapientiam caelestem, ac silvae scientiam naturalis hominis; ex his constare potest unde est quod `luci' significent doctrinam, et unde est quod antiqui sanctum cultus in lucis habuerint; Ecclesia 
enim apud antiquos fuit repraesentativa, cujus externa omnia repraesentabant interna, qualia sunt in caelo de Domino, de amore et de fide in Ipsum, et de talibus quae amoris et fidei sunt.  Quod luci, 
tum silvae, horti, et paradisi, {2}ut et arbores secundum species suas, talia significent, ducit causam ex repraesentativis in altera vita, nam ibi apparent talia secundum intelligentiam et sapientiam 
angelorum, sunt enim ibi apparentiae ex caelesti et spirituali origine.  Quod luci significent doctrinam, et quod antiqui sanctum {3}cultum in lucis habuerint, videatur n. 2722, 4552, quod `paradisi' 
significent intelligentiam et sapientiam caelestem, n. 3220, 4528, 4529, quod `horti' similiter, n. 100, 108, 1588, 2722, quod `silvae' significent scientiam quae naturalis hominis, n. 9011 fin., quod 
`arbores' significent perceptiones et cognitiones boni et veri, n. 103, 2163, 2682, 2972, 7692, 8326, quod Antiqua Ecclesia {4}habuerit cultum in lucis et in hortis sub arboribus secundum earum significationes, 
n. 2722, 4552. @1 doctrina Ecclesiae altered to doctrinalia Ecclesiae then restored doctrina Ecclesiae$ @2 et quod unaquaevis arbor$ @3 cultus$ @4 habuerint$ </p>
