<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1614节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1614.</strong>“因为我必把这地赐给你”表这国是祂的。这是显而易见的，无需解释。前面多次说明，“地”或天国唯独是主的，其他人并非天堂的主。祂因是天堂的主，故也是教会的主。这从以下事实也清楚可知，即一切属天、属灵之物，或善与真唯独出自主。因此，主是其天堂全部中的全部，这是千真万确的，以致凡对主的良善与真理没有洞察力的人便不再处于天堂。这就是遍及整个天堂的气场；这也是天堂的灵魂，是流入所有被良善主导之人的生命。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1614.</strong> The meaning of because to you I will give it as the fact that it would be his can be seen without explanation.<br />Certain points that have been demonstrated many times show that the "land" 钬?the kingdom of heaven 钬?is the Lord's alone: specifically, that no one else is the Lord of heaven [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1614/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_14" target=_top>14</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1614/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_15" target=_top>15</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1614/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_300" target=_top>300</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1614/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_458" target=_top>458</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1614/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_548" target=_top>548:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1614/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1607" target=_top>1607</a>], and since he is the Lord of heaven, he is also the Lord of the church [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1614/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_768#subsection-2-3" target=_top>768:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1614/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585" target=_top>1585:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1614/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1607" target=_top>1607</a>]. It can also be seen from the fact that everything heavenly or spiritual (everything good or true) comes from the Lord alone, with the result that the Lord is the all-in-all of his heaven 钬?so much so that anyone who fails to see goodness and truth as coming from the Lord ceases to be in heaven. Such is the prevailing atmosphere throughout heaven. Such is the soul of heaven as well, and such is the life force that flows into everyone who cultivates goodness. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1614</b></p><p><b>1614.</b>
For unto thee will I give it. That this signifies that it should be His, is evident without explication. That "the land," or the heavenly kingdom, is the Lord's alone, is evident from what has been shown 
so many times, namely, that no other is the Lord of heaven; and as He is the Lord of heaven, He is the Lord of the church also. It is also evident from the fact that all the celestial and the spiritual, 
or good and truth, are from the Lord alone, and from these the Lord is the all in all of His heaven, and this so completely that he who has no apperception of good and truth from the Lord, is 
no longer in heaven. This is the sphere that reigns in the universal heaven; this also is the soul of heaven; and this is the life that inflows into all who are in good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1614</b></p><p><b>1614.</b>
'For to you will I give it' means that it was His. This is clear without explanation. That 'the land', or heavenly kingdom, is the Lord's alone is clear from what has been shown many times, namely that 
there is no other Lord of heaven. And being the Lord of heaven He is also the Lord of the Church. This is also clear from the fact that everything celestial and spiritual, or good and true, comes from 
the Lord alone. The Lord is therefore the All in all of His heaven, insomuch indeed that anyone who has no discernment of good and truth from the Lord is no longer in heaven. This sphere is the sphere 
that reigns throughout the whole of heaven. It is also the very soul of heaven, and is the life that flows into all who are governed by good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1614</b>
</p><b>1614.</b>
'Quia tibi dabo illam': quod significet quod Ipsius esse constat absque explicatione.  Quod terra seu regnum caeleste sit solius Domini, constat ab illis quae pluries ostensa sunt quod nempe non alius 
sit Dominus coeli; et quia est Dominus coeli, etiam est Dominus Ecclesiae; constat etiam ex eo quod omne caeleste et spirituale, seu bonum et verum, a solo Domino, ex quibus Dominus est Omne in omnibus 
Sui caeli, et quidem in tantum ut qui non appercipit bonum et verum a Domino, non amplius sit in caelo; hae sphaera est quae regnat in universo caelo; haec quoque est anima caeli, et haec est vita 
quae influit in omnes qui in bono sunt. </p>
