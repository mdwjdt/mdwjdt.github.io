<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10754节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10754</strong>.当传教士与那些穿着衣服的人在一起时，一个女人出现了，她面容非常美丽，穿着朴素，一件外衣得体地披在身后，并且拉到胳膊以上；头上戴着花环状的漂亮头饰。一看见这个少女，传教士就非常欢喜，与她交谈，还拉着她的手。但少女发觉他是一个灵人，不属于这个星球，于是便挣脱了他。后来，右边又有许多女人向他显现；她们在放牧绵羊和羔羊，当时正把这些羊赶到水槽，水槽里的水是从一个湖通过一个小水沟引过来的。这些女人穿着相似，手拿牧杖，用它引绵羊和羔羊喝水。她们说，绵羊会顺着她们的牧杖所指的方向走。只见这些绵羊个头都很大，毛茸茸的尾巴又宽又长。近前看时，这些女人的脸既丰满又漂亮。男人也出现了，他们的脸也是肉色，跟我们地球上一样；不同之处在于，他们脸的下面部分没长胡须，而是发黑；而鼻子比肉色更雪白。</p>

While the preacher was with those who were clothed, there appeared a woman of a very beautiful countenance, clothed in a simple garment, a tunic that hung behind in a becoming way, and was also drawn 
over the arms; she also wore a beautiful head covering in the form of a garland of flowers. Upon seeing this virgin, the preacher was very much delighted, and spoke to her, and also took hold of her 
hand; but as she perceived that he was a spirit, and was not from that earth, she betook herself away from him. There afterward appeared to him a number of other women on the right, who were pasturing 
sheep and lambs, which they were then leading to a drinking-trough, into which water was brought through a little channel from a lake. These were clothed in the same way, and they held in their hands 
shepherds' crooks, by which they led the sheep and lambs to drink. They said that the sheep go in the direction in which they point with their crooks. The sheep that were seen were large, and had woolly, 
broad, and lengthy tails. When the faces of the women were seen more closely, they were full and beautiful. Men also were seen. Their faces were of a human flesh color, as on our earth; but with 
the difference that instead of being bearded, the lower part of their face was black; and the nose was more of the color of snow than of flesh. </p>

While the preacher was with the ones wearing clothes a woman with a very lovely face appeared. She was wearing a simple garment or tunic which hung becomingly at the back and was also drawn over the 
arms; and she had a beautiful headdress that took the form of a garland of flowers. When the preacher saw that virgin he began to take very great delight in her, to talk to her, and also to grasp her 
by the hand. But because she recognized that he was a spirit, and did not belong to that planet, she pulled herself away from him. Afterwards there appeared to him on the right a large number of other 
women who were tending sheep and lambs which they were leading then to a drinking-trough containing water that had been brought to it through a small ditch from some lake. They were dressed in a similar 
way, and in their hands they held shepherds' rods, which they used to guide the sheep and lambs to their drink. They said that the sheep go in whatever direction they indicate with their rods. The 
sheep that were seen were large, having woolly tails which were broad and long. The women's faces when seen close up were full and beautiful. When the men too were seen, their faces had the colour of 
human flesh as on our planet; but they were different in that the lower part of the face where the beard grows was black, while the nose was whiter than flesh colour.  </p>

Cum praedicator erat apud illos qui vestiti, apparebat femina perquam bella facie, induta veste simplici; tunica pendente a tergo decenter, et quoque inducta super bracchia; tegumentum capitis pulchrum 
erat, in forma serti ex floribus; praedicator, visa illa virgine, delectabatur valde, et loquebatur cum illa, et quoque prehendebat ejus manum; sed quia illa appercipiebat quod spiritus esset, et 
non ex illa tellure, proripiebat se ab illo.  Postea apparebant ei a dextro plures aliae feminae quae pascebant oves et agnos, quos tunc ducebant ad canalem potatorium in quem aqua deducta {1}erat per 
fossulam ex aliquo lacu; illae similiter vestitae erant, manibus tenentes baculos pastoritios, per quos ducebant oves et agnos ad potum; dicebant quod oves illuc vadant quo baculis suis ostendunt; oves 
quae visae erant grandes caudis lanigeris, latis et protensis; facies feminarum visae sunt propius, erant plenae et pulchrae. Viri etiam visi sunt, eorum facies erant colore humano carneo, sicut in 
nostra tellure; sed cum differentia, quod inferior pars faciei eorum, loco barbae, esset nigra; et nasus plus niveo colore quam carneo. @1 fuit$ </p>
