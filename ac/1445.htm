And Jehovah was seen by Abram and said, "To your seed I will give this land."

And said, "To your seed I will give this land," means that those who believed in him would receive heavenly gifts.

Verse 7. And Jehovah was seen of Abram, and said, To thy seed will I give this land. And there he built an altar to Jehovah, who was seen of him. "Jehovah was seen of Abram," signifies that Jehovah appeared 
to the Lord while yet a child; "and said, To thy seed will I give this land," signifies that celestial things should be given to those who should have faith in Him; "and there he built an altar 
to Jehovah, who was seen of him," signifies the first worship of His Father from the celestial of love. </p>

Verse 7 And Jehovah appeared to Abram and said, To your seed will I give this land; and there he built an altar to Jehovah who had appeared to him. </p>
<p>'Jehovah appeared to Abram' means that Jehovah showed 
Himself to the Lord when He was still a boy. 'And He said, To your seed will I give this land' means that celestial things would be granted to those who had faith in Him. 'And there he built an 
altar to Jehovah who had appeared to him' means initial worship of His Father from the celestial, which essentially is love </p>

</p><b>1445.</b>
Vers. 7.  Et visus Jehovah Abramo, et dixit, Semini tuo dabo terram hanc,' et aedificabat ibi altare Jehovae, Qui visus illi.  'Visus Jehovah Abramo' significat quod Jehovah apparuerit Domino cum adhuc 
puer:  'et dixit, Semini tuo dabo terram hanc' significat quod illis qui fidem in Ipsum haberent, caelestia donarentur:  'et aedificabat ibi altare Jehovae, Qui visus illi' significat primum cultum 
Patris Sui ex caelesti amoris. </p>
