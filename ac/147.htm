<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第147节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>147.</strong>创世记2:21 耶和华神使他沉睡，他就睡了，于是取下他的一条肋骨，又把肉在肋骨处合起来。<br />胸间的“一条肋骨”，象征人的自我，它少有生气，却为人所珍视。“肉在肋骨处合起来”，象征获得了生气的自我；“沉睡”，表示人进入看似拥有自我的状态，因为在此状态下，他以为他是凭自己生活、思想、言说、行动。等他看破这一假相，就好似从梦中醒来了。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]147.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_147/bible_king-james-version_genesis_2_21" target=_top>Genesis 2:21</a>. And Jehovah God made slumber fall on the human, and he went to sleep. And he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in its place.<br />The rib, a chest bone, means that part of our identity which is hardly alive and yet is our very own, so that we love it tenderly. The flesh in place of the rib means the part of our identity that is alive. Slumber means a state brought over us to make it seem to us as if we have autonomy. This state is like sleep because in it we have no idea that we do not live, think, speak, and act on our own; but when we begin to realize how wrong this view is, we are roused from our sleep and wake up. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 147</b></p><p><b>147.</b>
Verse 21. And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in the place thereof. By a "rib" which is a bone of the chest, is 
meant man's Own, in which there is but little vitality, and indeed an Own which is dear to him; by "flesh in the place of the rib" is meant an Own in which there is vitality; by a "deep sleep" is meant 
the state into which he was let so that he might seem to himself to have what is his own, which state resembles sleep, because while in it he knows not but that he lives, thinks, speaks, and acts, 
from himself. But when he begins to know that this is false, he is then roused as it were out of sleep, and becomes awake. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 147</b></p><p><b>147.</b>
Verse 21 And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he fell asleep; and He took one of his ribs, and He closed up the flesh in its place.  </p>
<p>'A rib', which is a breast bone, is used 
to mean man's proprium when it contains very little life, a proprium indeed that he cherishes. 'The flesh in place of the rib Is used to mean the proprium when it does contain some life. 'A deep sleep' 
is used to mean that state into which he was brought so that he might seem to himself to have a proprium. This state resembles sleep because a person in that state is conscious only of living, thinking, 
speaking, and acting from himself. But when he starts to realize that this is false, he is aroused from sleep so to speak and wakes up.  </p>

</p><b>147.</b>
Vers. 21.  Et cadere fecit Jehovah Deus soporem super hominem, et obdormivit; et accepit unam e costis illius, et occlusit carnem loco ejus. Per 'costam,' quae est os pectoris, intelligitur proprium 
hominis in quo parum vitale, et quidem proprium quod ei est carum: per 'carnem loco costae' intelligitur proprium in quo vitale: per 'soporem' status ille in quem missus ut proprium videretur sibi habere, 
qui status est instar somni, quia in statu illo non aliter scit quam quod ex semet vivat, cogitet, loquatur, et agat; at cum scire incipit quod id falsum, tunc expergiscitur sicut a somno et vigil fit.
