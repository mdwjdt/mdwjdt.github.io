<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5187节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5187.</strong>有一个灵人曾来到我这里，问我是否知道他能待在哪里。我原以为他是一个正直灵人，当我告诉他，他或许可以待在我所在的地方时，属于这个区域的搅动灵人来了，悲惨地折磨他。我对此感到很伤心，徒劳地想要阻止他们。就在这时，我发现我在胆囊区域。这些搅动的灵人就是那些藐视正直和敬虔的灵人当中的。我蒙允许在那里见证了一种搅动，就是强迫一个灵人快速说话，比他所能想象的还要快。他们通过将该灵人的言语与思维割裂开来，然后强迫他说他们所说的话而做到这一点，这样做是很痛苦的。通过这种搅动形式，慢人被引入更快速的思考和说话中。</p>

A certain spirit came to me, inquiring whether I knew where he might stay; and when, thinking him well disposed, I told him that possibly he might stay here, there came agitating spirits of this province 
who tormented him miserably. I was sorry for this, and in vain desired to prevent it. I then noticed that I was in the province of the gall-bladder. The agitating spirits were of those who despise 
what is upright and pious. It was granted me to observe one kind of agitation there, that consists in forcing one to speak faster than he can think. This they effected by abstracting the speech from 
the thought, and by then forcing the spirit to follow their speech, which it is painful to do. By means of such an agitation the slow are inaugurated into a quicker thinking and speaking. </p>

A certain spirit once came to me, asking whether I knew a place where he could stay. I thought he was an upright spirit, and when I told him that he could perhaps stay where I was, harrier spirits who 
belonged to this province came along and harried him piteously. This grieved me, and I sought in vain to stop them. At this point I became aware of the fact that I was in the province of the gall bladder. 
The harrying spirits were some of those who despised uprightness and godliness. I was allowed to witness one kind of harrying there, which consisted in compelling a spirit to speak faster than 
he could think. This they accomplished by severing his own speech from his thought and then compelling him to speak what they were speaking, a painful experience. By means of this form of harrying the 
slow are introduced into thinking and speaking more quickly. </p>

Quidam spiritus ad me venit, quaerens num scirem ubi is morari posset; existimavi quod esset probus, cumque ei dicerem quod hic fortassis posset, venerunt spiritus vexatores hujus provinciae et eum 
misere vexabant, quod dolui, et incassum volui inhibere; </p>
<p>animadverti tunc quod essem in provincia vesicae fellis; spiritus vexatores fuerunt cx illis qui contempserunt probum et pium. Unum genus 
vexationis ibi observare datum est, erat coactio ad loquendum citius quam cogitatur, quod faciebant per abstractionem loquelae a cogitatione, et tunc per coactionem sequendi (c)eorum loquelam, quod 
fit cum dolore; per talem vexationem inaugurantur tardi ad citius cogitandum et {1}loquendum. @1 volendum$ </p>
