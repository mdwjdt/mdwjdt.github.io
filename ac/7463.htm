<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7463节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7463.</strong>“摩西说，看哪，我要从你这里出去”表神的真理在他们当中的显现的移除。这从“摩西”的代表和“出去”的含义清楚可知：“摩西”是指神之律法（参看<a href="6723.htm">6723</a>，<a href="6752.htm">6752</a>节），因而也指神的真理（<a href="7014.htm">7014</a>，<a href="7382.htm">7382</a>节）；“出去”是指移除，如前所述（<a href="7404.htm">7404</a>节）。因为法老召摩西、亚伦表示神之真理的出现（<a href="7451.htm">7451</a>节）；因此，“从他这里出去”在此表示移除。至于恶人当中的神之真理的出现和移除，要知道，从神来的真理有时向他们显现，是通过一位天使在他们附近出现而如此行的；但对他们来说，从神来的真理不像良善那样经由内层而流入，因为他们的内层已经关闭；它只影响他们的外层。当这种情况发生时，他们充满恐惧，由此充满谦卑，因为从神来的真理的出现使他们不安，并将恐惧灌进他们的内心，这种恐惧就像对死亡的恐惧。但当从神来的真理被移除时，他们就回到以前的状态，没有了恐惧。这一切就是神之真理的显现的出现和移除所表示的。这一切也由法老来代表，当摩西与他同在时，他就谦卑自己，并答应容百姓去祭祀耶和华；但当摩西从他这里出去时，他就使自己的心发沉（8:28）。因为如前所示，摩西代表神的律法或神的真理。<br />神的律法和神的真理是一回事，这是因为神的律法表示圣言，因而表示神的真理。“律法”表示圣言，因而表示神的真理，这一点从以下经文明显看出来：<br />耶稣说，你们的律法上岂不是写着，我曾说你们是神吗？经上的话是不能废的。若那些承受圣言的人，尚且称为神。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.34.htm">10:34</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.35.htm">35</a>）<br />“律法上写着”表示这些话在圣言中的出现，因为它们写在诗篇中。同一福音书：<br />众人说，我们从律法上听说，基督是永存的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.34.htm">12:34</a>）<br />这句话也写在诗篇中。同一福音书：<br />耶稣说，这要应验他们律法上所写的：他们无故恨我。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.25.htm">15:25</a>）<br />这句话也在诗篇。路加福音：<br />这是照主的律法所写：凡开胎首生的男性必称圣归主；又要照主的律法上所写，或用一对斑鸠，或用两只雏鸽献祭。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路2.23.htm">2:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路2.24.htm">24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路2.39.htm">39</a>）<br />这条诫命在摩西五经。同一福音书：<br />有一个律法师试探耶稣，说，我该做什么才可以承受永生？耶稣对他说，律法上写的是什么？你念的是怎样呢？（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.25.htm">10:25</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.26.htm">26</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />律法和先知到约翰为止，从那时起，神国的福音传开了；天地废去较比律法的一点一画落空还容易。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路16.16.htm">16:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路16.17.htm">17</a>）<br />此外还有其它经文，在这些经文中，圣言被称为“律法和先知”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.18.htm">5:18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.12.htm">7:12</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太11.13.htm">11:13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.40.htm">22:40</a>）。以赛亚书：<br />你要卷起法版，为我门徒封住律法。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛8.16.htm">8:16</a>）<br />“律法”表示圣言。同一先知书：<br />说谎的儿女，不肯听从耶和华律法的儿女。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.9.htm">30:9</a>）<br /><br />祂要在地上设立公理，海岛都期待祂的律法。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.4.htm">42:4</a>）<br />这论及主；“祂的律法”表示主。同一先知书：<br />耶和华使律法为大为尊。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.21.htm">42:21</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />耶和华如此说，你们若不听从我，不遵行我设立在你们面前所立的律法，不听我仆人众先知的话。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶26.4.htm">26:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶26.5.htm">5</a>）<br />此处“律法”表示圣言；此外还有其它许多经文。由此明显可知，“律法”表示圣言，它因表示圣言，故表示神的真理，如耶利米书：<br />耶和华说，那些日子以后，我要与以色列家所立的约乃是这样：我要将我的律法放在他们中间，写在他们心上。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.33.htm">31:33</a>）<br />此处“耶和华的律法”表示神的真理。<br />“律法”在广泛意义上是指整部圣言，在不怎么广泛的意义上是指圣言的历史部分，在狭义上是指摩西所写的圣言，在严格意义上是指十诫（参看<a href="6752.htm">6752</a>节）。由此可见为何说摩西代表神的律法和神的真理这二者。</p>

And Moses said, Behold I go forth from thee. That this signifies the removal of the appearance of truth Divine among them, is evident from the representation of Moses, as being the law Divine (see n. 
6723, 6752), thus also truth Divine (n. 7014, 7382); and from the signification of "going forth," as being removal (as above, n. 7404). For by Pharaoh's calling Moses and Aaron is signified the presence 
of truth Divine (n. 7451); and therefore here by "going forth from him" is signified removal. As regards the presence and the removal of truth Divine with the evil, be it known that truth from the 
Divine sometimes appears to them, and this through the presence of an angel near them; but truth from the Divine does not flow in with them through the interiors, as with the good, because with them 
the interiors have been closed; but it affects their exteriors only. When this happens they are in fear, and from this in humiliation, for the presence of truth from the Divine strikes them with dismay, 
and inspires them with fear as of death; but when truth from the Divine is removed they return into their former state and are devoid of fear. This is what is meant by the presence of the appearance 
of truth Divine, and by its removal. This also was represented by Pharaoh, in that when Moses was present he humbled himself and promised to let the people go, that they might sacrifice to Jehovah; 
but when Moses had gone forth from him he made heavy his heart (verse 28); for as shown above, Moses represented the law Divine, or truth Divine. [2] That the law Divine is the same as truth Divine, 
is because the "law Divine" signifies the Word, and thus truth Divine. That the "law" signifies the Word, and thus truth Divine, is evident from the following passages: </p>
<p>     Jesus said, Is it not written 
in your law, I said Ye are gods? If He called them gods unto whom the Word was made, and the scripture cannot be broken (John 10:34-35); </p>
<p>where "written in the law" denotes in the Word, for it is 
written in David. In the same: </p>
<p>     The multitude said, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth forever (John 12:34); </p>
<p>this also was written in David. In the same: </p>
<p>     Jesus said that the 
word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated Me without a cause (John 15:25); </p>
<p>this also is in David. In Luke: </p>
<p>     It is written in the law of the Lord that every male that openeth 
the womb should be called holy to the Lord, and that they should offer a sacrifice according to that which is written in the law of the Lord; a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons (Luke 2:23-24, 
39); </p>
<p>this is in Moses. In the same: </p>
<p>     A lawyer tempting Jesus, said, What shall I do to receive the heritage of eternal life? Jesus said unto him, What is written in the law? How readest thou? 
(Luke 10:25-26). [3] In the same: </p>
<p>     The law and the prophets were until John; from that time the kingdom of God is evangelized: it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than for one tittle of 
the law to fall (Luke 16:16-17); </p>
<p>besides passages where the Word is called "the law and the prophets" (as Matt. 5:18; 7:12; 11:13; 22:40). In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Bind together the testimony, seal up the 
law for those whom I will teach (Isa. 8:16); </p>
<p>"the law" denotes the Word. In the same: </p>
<p>     Lying sons, sons that would not hear the law of Jehovah (Isa. 30:9).       He will set judgment in the earth, 
and the isles shall hope in His law (Isa. 42:4); </p>
<p>this is said of the Lord; "His law" denotes the Word. In the same: </p>
<p>     Jehovah shall magnify His law (Isa. 42:21).      Thus said Jehovah, If ye 
will not obey Me, to go in My law, which I have set before you, and ye are hearing the words of My servants the prophets (Jer. 26:4-5); </p>
<p>where "the law" denotes the Word; besides many other passages. 
From this it is evident that "the law" denotes the Word, and because it denotes the Word, it denotes truth Divine, as in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel 
after these days, said Jehovah; I will put My law in the midst of them, and I will write it on their heart (Jer. 31:33); </p>
<p> where "the law of Jehovah" denotes truth Divine. [4] That "the law" in a wide 
sense is the whole Word, in a less wide sense the historic Word, in a still less wide sense the Word written by Moses, and in a narrow sense the commandments of the Decalogue, see n. 6752. From all 
this it can now be seen why it is said that Moses represents both the law Divine and also truth Divine. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7463</b></p><p><b>7463.</b>
'And Moses said, Behold, I go out from you' means the removal of the appearance of God's truth among them. This is clear from the representation of 'Moses' as the law of God, dealt with in <a href="6723.htm">6723</a>, <a href="6752.htm">6752</a>, 
thus God's truth also, <a href="7014.htm">7014</a>, <a href="7381.htm">7381</a>; and from the meaning of 'going out' as a removal, as above in <a href="7404.htm">7404</a>. For 'Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron' means the presence of God's truth, <a href="7451.htm">7451</a>, and therefore 'going 
out from him' here means a removal. In considering the presence and removal of God's truth among the evil, one should realize that truth from God sometimes appears to them, and that it does so through 
the presence of an angel near them. But with them truth from God does not come in by way of their interiors, as it does with the good, because their interiors are closed. It has an effect only on 
their exteriors. When this happens they are filled with fear and consequently self-abasement, for the presence of truth from God perturbs them and strikes fear into them that is like the fear of death. 
But when the truth from God is removed they return to their previous state of mind and have no fear. This is what is meant by the presence of the appearance of God's truth and its removal. It was also 
represented by Pharaoh, by his self-abasement while Moses was present with him, and his promise to send the people away to sacrifice to Jehovah, and by his 'making his heart stubborn after Moses had 
gone out from him', verse 28. For as shown above, 'Moses' represented the law of God or God's truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The law of God and God's truth are one and the same because the law of God means the Word, 
and accordingly God's truth. The fact that 'the law means the Word and accordingly God's truth is clear from the following places: In John, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said, Is it not written in your law, I said, You 
are Gods? If He called them gods, with whom the Word came to be, and the Scripture cannot be broken . . . <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2010:34,%2035&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 10:34, 35</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Written in the law' stands for the presence of those words in the Word, for 
they are written in David. In the same gospel,  </p>
<blockquote>
The crowd said, We have heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2012:34&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 12:34</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>These words too are written in David. In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus 
said, In order that the Word written in the Law might be fulfilled, They hated Me without a cause. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2015:25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 15:25</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This as well is found in David. In Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
It is written in the Law of the 
Lord that every male opening the womb should be called holy to the Lord; and that they should offer a sacrifice, in keeping with what is written in the Law of the Lord, of a pair of turtle-doves, or 
two young pigeons. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%202:23,%2024,%2039&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 2:23, 24, 39</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This command is contained in Moses. In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
A lawyer testing Jesus said, What must I do to inherit eternal life? Jesus said to him. What is written 
in the Law? What is your reading of it? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2010:25,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 10:25, 26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
The Law and the Prophets were until John. Since that time the kingdom of God is proclaimed. It is easier for heaven 
and earth to pass away than for one tittle of the Law to fall. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2016:16,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 16:16, 17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
There are other places besides this in which the Word is called the Law and the Prophets, such as <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%205:18;%207:12;%2011:13;%2022:36,%2040&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 5:18; 7:12; 11:13; 22:36, 40</a>. 
</blockquote>
In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Bind up the testimony, seal the Law for the benefit of My disciples. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%208:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 8:16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The Law' stands for the Word. In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
. . . lying sons, sons who 
did not wish to hear the Law of Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2030:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 30:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
He will set judgement on the earth, the islands hope for His Law. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2042:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 42:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord, 'His Law' standing 
for the Word. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah will magnify His Law. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2042:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 42:21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said Jehovah, If you do not obey Me, to go in My Law which I have set before you, in order 
that you may hear the Word of My servants the prophets . . . <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2026:4,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 26:4, 5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the Law' stands for the Word, and in very many other places besides. From this it is evident that 'the Law' is the 
Word, and since it is the Word it is God's truth, as in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
This is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days, said Jehovah: I will put [My] Law in the midst of 
them, and will write it on their heart. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2031:33&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 31:33</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'Jehovah's Law' stands for God's truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In a broad sense 'the Law' is the whole Word, in a narrower sense the historical section of 
the Word, in an even narrower sense the Word written through Moses, and in a restricted sense the Ten Commandments, see <a href="6752.htm">6752</a>. </p>
<p>From all this one may now see why Moses is said to represent both the law 
of God and God's truth. </p>

</p><b>7463.</b>
`Et dixit Moscheh, Ecce ego egredior a cum te': quod significet remotionem apparentiae veri Divini apud illos, constat ex repraesentatione `Moschis' quod sit lex Divina, de qua n. 6723, 6752, ita quoque 
verum Divinum, n. 7014, 7382; et ex significatione `egredi' quod sit remotio, ut supra n. 7404; nam per quod `Pharao vocavit Moschen et Aharonem' significatur praesentia veri Divini, n. (x)7451; 
inde hic per `egredi ab illo' significatur remotio.  Quod praesentiam et remotionem veri Divini apud malos attinet, sciendum quod quandoque appareat illis verum a Divino, et hoc per praesentiam angeli 
prope illos; ast verum a Divino non influit apud illos per interiora sicut apud bonos, interiora enim apud illos clausa sunt; sed modo afficit exteriora illorum; hoc cum fit, in timore sunt, et inde 
in humiliatione, nam praesentia veri a Divino percellit illos, ac incutit timorem quasi mortis; at cum verum a Divino removetur, tunc in pristinum suum statum redeunt, et absque timore sunt; haec intelliguntur 
per praesentiam apparentiae veri Divini et per remotionem ejus; hoc quoque repraesentatum est per Pharaonem quod {1}ille, cum Moscheh apud (c)eum praesens esset, humiliaverit se, et promiserit 
quod dimitteret populum ut sacrificarent Jehovae; sed cum Moscheh egressus est ab illo, quod aggravaverit cor suum, {2} vers. 28 seq.; `Moscheh' enim, ut supra {3} ostensum, repraesentavit legem Divinam 
seu verum Divinum. 	2 Quod lex Divina idem sit cum vero Divino, est quia lex Divina significat Verbum, {4}ac ita verum Divinum.  Quod `lex' significet Verbum ac (x)ita verum Divinum, constat a 
sequentibus locis: apud Johannem, Jesus dixit, Nonne scriptum est in lege vestra, Ego dixi, Dii estis? si eos dixit deos ad quos factum est Verbum, et non potest solvi scriptura, x 34[,35]; </p>
<p>`scriptum 
in lege' pro in Verbo, nam scriptum est apud Davidem: apud eundem, Dixit turba, Nos audivimus ex Lege quod Christus manet in aeternum, xii 34; </p>
<p>hoc quoque scriptum est apud Davidem {5}: apud eundem, Dixit 
Jesus, Ut impleretur Verbum scriptum in Lege, Odio habuerunt Me sine causa, (x)xv 25; </p>
<p>hoc etiam apud Davidem: apud Lucam, Scriptum est in Lege Domini quod omnis masculus aperiens uterum sanctum 
Domino vocandus esset: et ut darent sacrificium juxta quod scriptum est in Lege Domini, par turturum, aut duos pullos columbarum, ii 23, 24, 39; </p>
<p>hoc apud Moschen: apud eundem, Legisperitus tentans 
Jesum dixit, Quidnam faciam ut vitae aeternae hereditatem accipiam?  Jesus dixit ad illum, In Lege quid scriptum est? quomodo legis? x 25, 26: </p>
<p>3 apud eundem, Lex et Prophetae usque ad Johannem; 
abhinc regnum Dei evangelizatur: facilius est caelum (c)et terram transire quam Legis unum apicem cadere, xvi 16, 17: </p>
<p>praeter in locis ubi Verbum vocatur Lex et Prophetae, ut Matth. v 18, vii 12, xi 
13, xxii 34, 38 [A.V. 36, 40] apud Esaiam, Colliga testimonium, obsigna Legem pro erudiendis Meis, viii 16; </p>
<p>`Lex' pro Verbo: apud eundem, Filii mendaces, filii non voluerunt audire Legem Jehovae, xxx 
9: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Ponet in terra judicium, in Lege Ipsius insulae sperabunt, xlii 4; </p>
<p>{6}hic de Domino, `Lex Ipsius' pro Verbo: apud eundem, Jehovah magnificabit Legem Suam, xlii 21: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam, Sic 
dixit Jehovah, Si non oboediveritis Mihi, ad eundum in Lege Mea quam dedi coram vobis, (x)ut audiatis Verbum servorum Meorum prophetarum, (x)xxvi 4, 5; </p>
<p>ibi `Lex' {7} pro Verbo {8}; praeter in 
pluribus aliis locis; inde patet quod `Lex' sit Verbum, et quia est Verbum, est verum Divinum, (d)ut apud Jeremiam, Hoc foedus quod pangam cum domo Israelis post dies hos, dictum Jehovae, Dabo Legem 
in medio illorum et super cor illorum scribam illam, xxxi 33; </p>
<p>ibi `Lex' {9}Jehovae pro vero Divino. 	4 Quod `Lex' in lato sensu sit totum Verbum, in minus lato Verbum historicum, in {10}adhuc minus 
lato Verbum quod per Moschen scriptum est, et in {11}stricto quod sint praecepta decalogi, videatur n. 6752.  Ex his nunc constare potest cur dicitur quod Moscheh repraesentet et legem Divinam et quoque 
verum Divinum. 	@1 Before humiliaverit$ 	@2 i ut patet a$ 	@3 i saepe$ 	@4 et Verbum est$ 	@5 i, ita per Legem intelligitur Verbum$ 	@6 ibi$ 	@7 i etiam$ 	@8 i prophetico$ 	@9 Domini$ 	@10
