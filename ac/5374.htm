<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5374节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5374.</strong>“买”表变成人自己的。这从“买”的含义清楚可知，“买”是指为自己获取，从而变成人自己的。属灵的获取并变成人自己的通过良善与真理实现。与此相对应的是世上通过金银支付所实现的获取并所有权；因为就灵义而言，“银”是指真理，“金”是指良善。因此，“买”表示变成人自己的，以下圣言经文中的“买”也是：<br />你们一切干渴的都当就近水来，没有银钱的，你们也可以来买了吃，不用银钱，不用价值，也来买酒和奶。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛55.1.htm">55:1</a>）<br />耶利米书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶13.1.htm">13:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶13.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶13.11.htm">11</a>）中的同样是。马太福音：<br />天国好像宝贝藏在田地里，人遇见了就把它藏起来，欢欢喜喜地去变卖一切所有的，买这块田地。天国又好像买卖人寻找好珠子，遇见一颗极贵重的珠子，就去变卖他一切所有的，把它买下来。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.44.htm">13:44</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.46.htm">46</a>）<br /><br />聪明的童女对愚拙的童女说，不如你们到卖油的那里去为自己买吧！她们去买的时候，新郎到了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.9.htm">25:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.10.htm">10</a>）<br />由于“买”表示变成人自己的，所以在圣言中，经上对用银子买的东西和以其它方式获得的东西作了明确区分。此外，用银子买的仆人可以说就是买者自己的，就像“家里生的或生在家中的”，只是处于较低层级。这也解释了为何经上经常一起提及这二者，如创世记：<br />你家里生的或你用银子买的，都必须受割礼。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创17.13.htm">17:13</a>）<br />利未记：<br />倘若祭司买人，是用银子买的，那人和生在他家的人，他们就可以吃他的食物。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利22.11.htm">22:11</a>）<br />由此明显可知在圣言中，“耶和华救赎的人（或领回的人）”表示什么，即表示那些获得良善与真理的人，因而表示那些主的东西已交给他们，成为他们自己的之人。</p>

To buy. That this signifies appropriation therefrom, is evident from the signification of "buying," as being to procure for one's self, thus to appropriate. Procuring and appropriating spiritually are 
effected by means of good and truth. To this corresponds the procuring and appropriating that in the world are effected by means of silver and gold; for in the spiritual sense "silver" is truth, and 
"gold" is good. Hence "buying" signifies appropriation, as also in the following passages in the Word: </p>
<p>	Everyone that thirsteth come ye to the waters, and he that hath no silver; come ye, buy and eat; 
yea, come, buy wine and milk without silver and without price (Isa. 55:1); and also in Jeremiah (Jer. 13:1-2, 11). In Matthew: </p>
<p>	The kingdom of the heavens is like unto treasure hid in the field; 
which when a man hath found, he hideth, and in his joy he goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like unto a merchantman, seeking goodly pearls, 
and he went and sold all that he had, and bought it (Matt. 13:44-46). Again: </p>
<p>	The prudent virgins said to the foolish ones, Go ye to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. And while they went to 
buy, the bridegroom came (Matt. 25:9-10). [2] As "buying" signifies appropriation, therefore in the Word the things bought with silver are well distinguished from those otherwise obtained. Moreover, 
the servants bought with silver were as one's own, and in a lower degree like those born in the house; and therefore they are often mentioned together, as in Genesis: </p>
<p>	Circumcising he shall be circumcised 
that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy silver (Gen. 17:13); </p>
<p>and in Leviticus: </p>
<p>	If a priest buy any soul with the purchase of silver, he and one that is born in his house, they 
shall eat of his bread (Lev. 22:11). Hence it is evident what is signified by the "redeemed (or those bought back) of Jehovah," in the Word, namely, those who have received good and truth, and thus 
those to whom the things of the Lord have been appropriated. </p>

'To buy [grain]' means a making one's own. This is clear from the meaning of 'buying' as acquiring to oneself and so making one's own. Spiritually, acquiring and making one's own is effected by means 
of good and truth, to which the acquisition and ownership that are achieved in the world by the payment of silver and gold correspond; for in the spiritual sense 'silver' is truth, and 'gold' is good. 
Consequently 'buying' means a making one's own, as it also does in the following places in the Word: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Everyone who thirsts, come to the waters, and he who has no money, come, buy, and eat! 
And come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2055:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 55:1</a> 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Also in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jeremiah%2013:1,%202,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jeremiah 13:1, 2, 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
In Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man (homo) 
finds and hides, and in his joy he goes and sells whatever he has and buys that field. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a trader seeking fine pearls, who, having found one pearl of great price, went 
and sold all that he had and bought it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:44-46&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13:44-46</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
The wise virgins said to the foolish ones, Go to those who sell and buy oil for yourselves. While they were going 
to buy, the Bridegroom came. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2025:9,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 25:9, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>

 Because 'buying' meant a making one s own, a clear distinction is made in the Word between things bought with silver and those acquired in some other 
way. Slaves bought with silver were so to speak the buyer's own, and were like 'those born in the house, but in a lower degree. This also explains why the two are mentioned together in various places, 
as in the command in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2017:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 17:3</a>, 'He who is born in your house and he who is bought with your silver must be circumcised', or as in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2022:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 22:11</a>, 'If a priest buys a person<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> - a buying with silver 
- [this person] and one who is born in his house shall eat of his bread'. From this one may see what is meant in the Word by 'the redeemed of Jehovah',<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> namely those who have acquired good and truth, 
thus those to whom things that are the Lord's have been made over as their own.

`Ad emendum': quod significet appropriationem, constat ex significatione `emere' quod sit comparare sibi, et sic appropriare; comparatio et appropriatio spiritualiter fit per bonum et verum; huic correspondet 
comparatio et appropriatio quae in mundo fit per argentum et aurum, `argentum' enim est verum, et `aurum' est bonum in spirituali sensu; inde `emptio' significat appropriationem; ut quoque 
in his locis in Verbo: apud Esaiam, Omnis sitiens ite ad aquas, et cui non argentum, ite, emite, et comedite, et ite, emite sine argento, et sine pretio, vinum et lac, lv 1:  etiam apud Jeremiam, xiii 
1, 2, 11: apud Matthaeum, Simile est regnum caelorum thesauro abscondito in agro, quem repertum homo abscondit, et prae gaudio suo abit, et omnia quaecumque habet, vendit, et emit agrum illum. Rursus 
simile est regnum caelorum homini negotiatori quaerenti pulchras margaritas,  qui  cum  invenit  unam  pretiosam  margaritam, abiit et {1} vendidit omnia quae habuit, et emit illam, xiii 44-46; </p>
<p>et 
apud eundem, Virgines prudentes dixerunt ad stultas, Ite ad vendentes, et emite vobis oleum; abeuntibus illis ad emendum venit Sponsus, xxv 9, 10; </p>
<p>[2] quia `emere' significabat appropriationem, ideo 
in Verbo {2} illa quae empta sunt argento, probe distinguuntur ab illis quae aliter comparata sunt; servi etiam qui empti argento {3}, erant sicut proprii, ac in inferiore gradu sicut nati domus; quapropter 
etiam passim una memorantur, ut Gen. xvii 13, Circumcidendo circumcidetur natus domus tuae, et emptio argenti tui {4}: </p>
<p>et (x)Lev. xxii 11, Si sacerdos emerit animam emptione argenti, et natus 
domus ejus, hi comedent de pane ejus {5}; </p>
<p>inde constare potest quid significatur per `redemptos Jehovae' in Verbo, quod nempe illi qui receperunt bonum et verum, ita quibus appropriata sunt illa 
quae sunt Domini. </p>
<p>1 abiens 2 quoque 3 i fuerunt 4 i vers. 13 5 i vers. 11 </p>
