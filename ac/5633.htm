Verses 15-17. And the men took this present, and they took double silver in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. And Joseph saw Benjamin with them, 
and he said to him that was over his house, Bring the men to the house, and slaying slay, and make ready; for the men shall eat with me at noon. And the man did as Joseph said; and the man brought the 
men to Joseph's house. "And the men took this present," signifies that truths had with them the means for obtaining favor; "and they took double silver in their hand," signifies also truth received in 
the ability; "and Benjamin," signifies and the intermediate also; "and rose up and went down to Egypt," signifies elevation to life to be gained by them from the interior things of memory-knowledges; 
"and stood before Joseph," signifies the presence of the celestial of the spiritual there; "and Joseph saw Benjamin with them," signifies the perception by the celestial of the spiritual of a spiritual 
intermediate with truths; "and he said to him that was over his house," signifies to that which is of the external church; "Bring the men to the house," signifies that the truths in the natural were

Verses 15-17 And the men took this gift, and took the double amount of silver in their hand, and Benjamin; and they rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. And Joseph saw Benjamin with 
them, and he said to the one who was over his house, Bring the men to the house, and slaughter and prepare [an animal]; for the men will eat with me at midday. And the man did as Joseph said, and 
the man brought the men to Joseph's house. </p>
<p>'And the men took [this] gift' means that the truths had with them the means to obtain favour. 'And took the double amount of silver in their hand' means 
also truth received by the power. 'And Benjamin' means the intermediary also. 'And they rose up, and went down to Egypt' means a raising up so as to acquire life from the interior areas of factual knowledge. 
'And stood before Joseph' means the presence there of the celestial of the spiritual. 'And Joseph saw Benjamin with them' means the discernment by the celestial of the spiritual that the spiritual 
intermediary was present with the truths. 'And he said to the one who was over his house' means that which belongs to the external Church. 'Bring the men to the house' means that the truths in the 
natural were to be introduced into it. 'And slaughter and prepare [an animal]' means through the forms of good belonging to the exterior natural. 'For the men will eat with me at midday' means that 
they will be joined together when accompanied by the intermediary. 'And the man did as Joseph said' means a putting into effect. 'And the man brought the men to Joseph's house' means the first introduction 
into good coming from the celestial of the spiritual. </p>
