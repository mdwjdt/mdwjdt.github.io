<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6624节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6624.</strong>由于人在感官层面进行思考，所以这类事物对他来说是模糊的，事实上如此模糊，以致他不知道何为一个观念，尤其不知道思维被分成了独立的观念，就像说话被分成了话语一样。因为在人看来，思维似乎是连贯的，而不是分离的；而事实上，思维观念是灵人所使用的话语，更内在的思维观念则是天使所使用的话语。观念因是他们说话所用的话语，故在灵人和天使中间也是听得见的，而且声音深沉洪亮。这解释了为何当主乐意时，世人静默的思维能被灵人和天使听见。思维相比说话的话语何等完美，这从以下事实可以看出来：一个人在一分钟之内所思想的事物，比他在一个小时内所说或所写的还要多。我还通过与灵人和天使交谈看出这一点；因为在这种时候，当投入情感时，我在一瞬间就用具体的细节填满了一个总的主题。天使和灵人清楚明白每一个细节，以及像云一样围绕这个主题显现出来的更多细节。</p>

As man thinks from what is sensuous, such things are obscure to him, nay, so obscure that he does not know what an idea is, and especially that thought is divided into ideas, as speech is into words; 
for thought appears to him continuous, and not discrete, when yet the ideas of thought are the words of spirits, and the ideas of a thought yet more interior are the words of angels. As ideas are the 
words of their speech, they are also sonorous among spirits and angels; hence the silent thought of man is audible to spirits and angels when it so pleases the Lord. How perfect the ideas of thought 
are in comparison with the words of speech, may be seen from the fact that a man can think more things within a minute than he can utter or write in an hour. The same could also be seen from speech with 
spirits and angels, for then in a moment I have filled a general subject with singulars, with the affection adjoined, whence the angels and spirits distinctly apprehended all things, and many more, 
which appeared about the subject like a cloud. </p>

Since man thinks on the level of the senses such things are obscure to him, so obscure indeed that he does not know what an idea is, in particular that thought is distinguished into separate ideas as 
speech is into words. For to man thought seems to be continuous, without separate parts; but in actual fact ideas constituting thought are the words that spirits use, and ideas constituting more internal 
thought are the words that angels use. And because ideas are the words they use to speak with, they are audible among spirits and angels. This explains why man's silent thought can be heard by spirits 
and angels, when it pleases the Lord that it should be. How perfect the ideas constituting thought are in comparison with the words composing speech may be recognized from the fact that a person 
can think more in a minute than he can speak or write in an hour. I have also recognized it from conversations with spirits and angels; for at such times I have in a single moment filled in the broad 
outlines of a subject with specific details, while my affection was engaged. The angels and spirits grasped every distinct detail, and many more that manifested themselves around that subject like a cloud. </p>

Quia homo ex sensuali cogitat, talia ei obscura sunt, immo ita obscura ut nesciat quid idea, et imprimis quod cogitatio sit distincta in ideas sicut loquela in voces, ei enim apparet cogitatio continua 
et non discreta, cum tamen ideae cogitationis sunt voces spirituum, (c)ac ideae cogitationis adhuc {1}interioris voces angelorum; ideae, quia sunt voces loquelae, etiam sunt sonorae inter spiritus 
et angelos; inde cogitatio hominis tacita est audibilis spiritibus et angelis, {2}quando Domino ita placet. Quam perfectae sunt ideae cogitationis {3}prae vocibus loquelae, constare potest ex eo quod 
homo intra minutum possit plura cogitare quam potest eloqui aut scribere per horam; tum quoque constare potuit ex loquela cum spiritibus et angelis, tunc enim momento implevi rem communem singularibus, 
adjuncta affectione, inde (t)angeli et spiritus distincte capiebant omnia, et multo plura quae apparebant circum rem illam sicut nimbus. @1 interiores$ @2 quod a multa experientia scire datum est$ @3
