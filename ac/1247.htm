<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1247.</strong>这些民族表众多仪式。这从以下事实明显可知：圣言中的名字从来不表示别的事物，只表示真实事物；因为圣言的内义只关注主，以及祂在天上和地上的国，因而关注教会和教会事物。此处这些名字的情形就是如此。由于“希伯的儿子约坍”表该新教会的外在敬拜，如前所述，所以他的子孙只表外在敬拜的事物，也就是仪式，事实上是众多仪式，并不表示别的。至于这些仪式是什么，就不好说了，因为它们的性质取决于它们所属的实际敬拜种类；若不知道这一点，就无法明白它的仪式；即便知道它们也没什么用。这些名字，除了示巴、阿斐、哈腓拉外，在圣言中都没再出现过；他们甚至不属这一支派，因为圣言别处所提及的示巴和哈腓拉是那些名为含的子孙之人的后代，这从本章第7节清楚可知；阿斐的情况也一样。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1247.</strong> The fact that they symbolize individual types of ritual can be seen from the consideration that names in the Word never have any meaning but a symbolic one. The Word in its inner sense concentrates exclusively on the Lord, on his kingdom in heaven and earth, and consequently on the church and its attributes. The same is true of these names.<br />Furthermore, since Eber's son Joktan symbolizes the outward devotions of this new church, as I said before, his own children cannot symbolize anything else than features of external worship, which are different kinds of ritual. In fact each must symbolize its own kind. Exactly what those types of ritual were, however, it is impossible to say. They depend for their character on the worship itself, and before the variety of worship is known well, nothing can be said about its rituals, and knowing about them would not be useful to anyone. Besides, the names never recur in the Word, except for those of Sheba, Ophir, and Havilah.{*1} And these are not offshoots of Joktan's stock, because the Sheba and Havilah that the Word talks about came from those who are called children of Ham, as verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1247/bible_king-james-version_genesis_10_7" target=_top>7</a> of the current chapter shows.{*2} The same is true of Ophir.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Sheba is a land frequently mentioned in the Bible whose exact location is unknown: the most plausible suggestion is today's Yemen, although the kingdom may have included parts of the coast of Eritrea and Ethiopia. It is most famous for the Queen of Sheba's visit to King Solomon (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1247/bible_king-james-version_1-kings_10_1-10" target=_top>1 Kings 10:1-10</a>; see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1247/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1171" target=_top>1171</a>). <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1247/bible_king-james-version_genesis_2_11-12" target=_top>Genesis 2:11-12</a> speaks of Havilah, watered by the river Pishon, as a land having gold, bdellium, and "the onyx stone." Ophir was also renowned for its gold: see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1247/bible_king-james-version_1-kings_9_28" target=_top>1 Kings 9:28</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1247/bible_king-james-version_1-kings_10_11" target=_top>10:11</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1247/bible_king-james-version_1-kings_22_48" target=_top>22:48</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1247/bible_king-james-version_1-chronicles_29_4" target=_top>1 Chronicles 29:4</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1247/bible_king-james-version_2-chronicles_8_18" target=_top>2 Chronicles 8:18</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1247/bible_king-james-version_2-chronicles_9_10" target=_top>9:10</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1247/bible_king-james-version_job_28_16" target=_top>Job 28:16</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1247/bible_king-james-version_psalms_45_9" target=_top>Psalms 45:9</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1247/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_13_12" target=_top>Isaiah 13:12</a>. [RS]<br />{*2} <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1247/bible_king-james-version_genesis_10_7" target=_top>Genesis 10:7</a> names a Sheba and a Havilah among the offspring of Cush, son of Ham. [LHC] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1247</b></p><p><b>1247.</b>
That by these nations are signified so many rituals, is evident from the fact that in the Word names never signify anything else than actual things; for in its internal sense the Word relates only to 
the Lord, to His Kingdom in the heavens and on earth, and consequently to the church and the things of the church. Such is the case with these names. And as Joktan, a son of Eber, signifies the external 
worship of this new church, as was said before, so his sons can signify nothing else than things of external worship, which are rituals, and in fact so many kinds of rituals. But what these kinds 
of rituals are, it is impossible to say, because they are determined by their relation to the worship itself, and until this is known nothing can be said about its rituals; nor would it be of any use 
to know them. Neither do the names recur in the Word, except Sheba, Ophir, and Havilah; and they are not of this stock; for the Sheba and Havilah elsewhere spoken of in the Word were of those who are 
called sons of Ham, as is evident at verse 7 of this chapter; and the case is the same with Ophir. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1247</b></p><p><b>1247.</b>
That those nations mean just so many types of ritual forms is clear from the consideration that names in the Word never mean anything other than real things, for the Word in the internal sense has regard 
solely to the Lord, His kingdom in heaven and on earth, and consequently to the Church and the things that constitute the Church. And so it is with the names involved here. And because 'Eber's son 
Joktan' means the external worship of this new Church, as stated already, 'his sons' cannot mean anything other than the things that constitute external worship, which are forms of ritual, and indeed 
just so many types of these. But what those forms were cannot be stated because their nature is determined by the actual kind of worship to which they belong, and until that is known, nothing can be 
said about the forms of ritual that belong to it. Neither would any use be served in knowing them. Nor do any of these names recur in the Word, apart from Sheba, Ophir, and Havilah, and even then they 
do not belong to this line of descent. For the Sheba and Havilah that are mentioned elsewhere in the Word descend from those who are called the sons of Ham, as is clear from verse 7 of this chapter. 
And the same applies to Ophir. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1247</b>
</p><b>1247.</b>
Quod per illas significentur totidem ritualia, constat ex eo quod nomina in Verbo nusquam aliud significent ac res, nam Verbum in sensu interno non spectat aliud quam Dominum, Ipsius regnum in caelis 
et in terris, proinde Ecclesiam et quae sunt Ecclesiae, ita haec nomina:  et quia 'filius Eberi Joktan' significat cultum externum novae hujus Ecclesiae, ut prius dictum, ita 'filii ejus' non aliud 
significare possunt quam quae sunt cultus externi, quae sunt ritualia, et quidem totidem eorum genera; sed quaenam genera ritualium, non dici potest, quia se habent respective ad ipsum cultum, qui antequam 
notus, de ritualibus ejus nihil dici potest, nec illa scire alicui usui foret; in Verbo nec occurrunt praeter Sheba, Ophir et Havilah, sed non sunt ex hac prosapia, nam Sheba et Havilah de quibus 
in Verbo, fuerunt ex illis qui vocantur filii Hami, ut constat a vers. 7 hujus capitis; ita se habet cum Ophir. </p>
