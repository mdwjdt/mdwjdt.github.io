<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1042.</strong>“我把我的彩虹放在云彩中”表重生的属灵之人的状态，它就象彩虹。有人可能纳闷，在圣言中，“云中的彩虹”居然是圣约的记号，因为彩虹无非是雨滴中的光线发生变换所造成的表象，它完全是自然现象，和刚才所提及教会中的其它圣约记号不一样。但没人能知道，“云中的彩虹”代表重生，并表示重生的属灵之人的状态，除非他得以看到并因此知道情况是怎么回事。凡重生为属灵教会成员的属灵天使，当在来生显于眼见时，头上就看似环绕一道彩虹。不过，所看到的彩虹与他们的状态完全一致；因此在天堂和精灵界，通过彩虹就能知道他们的品性。之所以显为彩虹的表象，是因为其对应于属灵之物的属世之物就呈现为这种可见的形状。主的属灵光线就在他们的属世之物里面进行变换。这些天使就是那些被说成是用“水和圣灵”重生的人，而属天的天使则被说成是用“火”重生的人。<br />至于属世的色彩，色彩的存在需要暗和明之物，或黑和白之物。当太阳的光线照到这些事物上时，根据暗和明，或黑和白的各种组合，色彩通过所流入光线的变换而产生。其中有些色彩多多少少偏暗和黑，有些则多多少少偏明和白，色彩的多样性即源于此。属灵之物中也存在类似现象。就属灵之物的情况而言，“暗”是指自我中心的理性部分，或虚假；“黑”是指吸收和熄灭光线的自我中心的意愿部分，或邪恶。而“明和白”则是人以为凭自己所行的真理或良善，它反射或从自身投射光线。落到这些事物上、仿佛改变它们的光线出于主，主如同智慧而又理性的太阳，因为属灵的光线不是别的，也没有其它来源。正因属世之物对应属灵之物，所以当环绕重生的属灵之人之物在来生显为可见时，它看似云彩中的彩虹，这彩虹代表了存在于其属世之物中的属灵之物。对重生的属灵之人而言，主将纯真、仁爱和怜悯注入到其自我中心的觉知中。其彩虹显现的表象就取决于这人对这些天赐（纯真、仁爱和怜悯）的接受程度。其自我中心的意愿越被迁移、制服，并变得顺从，这彩虹就越美丽。<br />当先知看见神时，他们也会看到云彩中仿佛有彩虹，如以西结书中的异象：<br />在基路伯头以上的穹苍之上有宝座的形像，仿佛蓝宝石的形状，宝座的形像上方有仿佛人的样子的形像在上头。我从祂腰及以上形像中仿佛看见如烧着火炭的形状，其中周围有火的形状。我又从祂的腰及以下的形像中仿佛看见火的形状，祂的光辉在它周围，就象下雨的日子，彩虹在云中的形状；周围光辉的形状也是这样；这就是耶和华荣耀的形像。 （以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结1.26.htm">1:26</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结1.28.htm">28</a>）<br />谁都能清楚看出，在这异象中所看到的是主，这时祂代表天堂，因为祂本身就是天堂，即天堂全部中的全部。祂自己就是此处所提及的“人”，“宝座”是天堂，“腰以上烧着的火炭，如火的形状”是爱的属天元素，“腰以下周围火的光辉，象云中的彩虹”是属天-属灵的元素。 因此，腰以上代表属天天堂，或属天天使的天堂，而腰以下则代表属灵天堂，或属灵天使的天堂。事实上，在大人里面（Grand Man），下面的事物，即从腰以下直到脚底之物表属世之物。由此也清楚看出，当来自主的属灵之光如此光照时，人里面的属世之物就具有“云中的彩虹”这样的表象。约翰也看到了同样的表象（参看启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启4.2.htm">4:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启4.3.htm">3</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启10.1.htm">10:1</a>）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1042.</strong> A bow I have put in the cloud symbolizes the circumstances of a spiritual person who has been reborn, which resemble a rainbow.<br />It might be hard to believe that a bow in the cloud — a rainbow — is taken as a sign of a pact in the Word, when a rainbow is nothing but the effect that results when rays of sunlight are modified as they pass through raindrops. Unlike other signs of the pact in the church (discussed just above [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1042/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038" target=_top>1038</a>]), it is nothing more than a physical phenomenon.<br />No one can recognize that a bow in the cloud represents regeneration — and symbolizes the circumstances of a spiritual person who has regenerated — except a person who has been permitted to see and learn how matters stand.<br />In the other world, when spiritual angels (all of whom were once regenerate people of the spiritual church) are so presented to view, a kind of rainbow appears around their head. The rainbows that appear, though, are simply an expression of the angels' state. This allows their nature to be recognized in heaven and in the world of spirits.<br />The reason this iridescent display appears is that those angels' earthly-type attributes, corresponding to spiritual ones, present this image. It is a modification of spiritual light from the Lord as received in their earthly characteristics.{*1} These angels are the ones said to be reborn of water and the spirit [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1042/bible_king-james-version_john_3_5" target=_top>John 3:5</a>]; heavenly angels, though, are reborn of fire [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1042/bible_king-james-version_matthew_3_11" target=_top>Matthew 3:11</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1042/bible_king-james-version_luke_3_16" target=_top>Luke 3:16</a>].<br />[2] In the world of nature, this is how it works: For color to exist, there has to be dark and light, or black and white. When sunlight falls on the dark and light (or black and white), variations in the balance of the two modify the rays in such a way as to create color. Some colors partake more or less of dark and black, some more or less of light, or white. That is what produces different colors.{*2} The situation in the realm of spirit is comparable. There, a dark color is intellectual conceit, or wrong thinking, while black is self-will, or evil, which absorbs and blots out rays of light. But a light color and white are the true and good things we imagine we do on our own, which reflect rays of light and bounce them back. The rays of light that fall on those colors and seemingly change them come from the Lord in his manifestation as a sun composed of wisdom and understanding. That is exactly what spiritual light rays are and exactly where they come from.<br />Earthly objects correspond to spiritual entities, and this is why something like a bow in a cloud appears (when the sight is presented in the other life) around a spiritual person who has been reborn. The bow is a representation of spiritual attributes within that person's earthly capacities.<br />People who are regenerate and spiritual have the sense that their power of understanding is their own, and into this intellectual selfhood the Lord instills innocence, kindness, and mercy. The way they receive these gifts determines how their rainbow looks, when displayed, and the more their self-will has been moved out of the way, conquered, and reduced to obedience, the more beautiful it is.<br />[3] When prophets were experiencing visions of God, they too saw a bow like that in the cloud. In Ezekiel, for instance:<br />Above the expanse that was over the head of the guardian beings was a seeming appearance of sapphire stone, like a throne, and what looked like the appearance of a person on it, high above. And I saw the seeming form of an ember, gleaming with the appearance of fire, within the form, all around, from the appearance of his hips and above. And from the appearance of his hips and below I saw the seeming appearance of fire, which had a brilliance all around. Like the appearance of a bow when it is in a cloud on a rainy day, so was the appearance of brilliance all around. This was the appearance of the likeness of Jehovah's glory. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1042/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_1_26-27" target=_top>Ezekiel 1:26-27</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1042/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_1_28" target=_top>28</a>)<br />Anyone can see that it was the Lord who was seen in this way, and that he was then representing heaven, because he is heaven; in other words, he is the all-in-all of heaven. He is the person described in these verses; the throne is heaven; the ember gleaming with the appearance of fire from his hips and above is the heavenly quality of love; the brilliance of the fire all around from his hips and below, like a bow in a cloud, is a heavenly-spiritual quality. So the heavenly heaven, or the heaven of heavenly angels, was represented by the pelvic area and what was above it, while the spiritual heaven, or the heaven of spiritual angels, was represented by the pelvic area and what was below it. In the universal human, the lower extremities from the pelvis down through the feet to the soles symbolize earthly elements.<br />This also shows that our earthly traits appear in the form of a bow in the cloud when spiritual light from the Lord illuminates them in this way.<br />A rainbow also appeared to John, as described in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1042/bible_king-james-version_revelation_4_2-3" target=_top>Revelation 4:2-3</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1042/bible_king-james-version_revelation_10_1" target=_top>10:1</a>.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} See Spiritual Experiences (Swedenborg 1998-2002) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1042/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_2347" target=_top>2347-2349</a> for a more exhaustive discussion of this rainbow display. [RS]<br />{*2} Swedenborg makes similar statements about black and white at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1042/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_731" target=_top>731</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1042/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2519" target=_top>2519</a>, and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1042/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4530" target=_top>4530</a>. Apparently this theory of colors stems from Aristotle, specifically his Sense and Sensibilia 439b (Aristotle 1984, 698), in which colors are hypothesized to arise from mixtures of white and black in specific ratios. And in fact, in Dynamics of the Soul's Domain (Swedenborg [1740-1741] 1955), part 1, 86, Swedenborg makes a tentative claim to have determined experimentally "the ratios of shades and lights by which individual colors may be designated." The theory is not without the support of appearances: after all, colors do become visible as night gives way to daylight, or, as Swedenborg puts it, color appears "where shade perceptibly begins to distinguish itself from light" (Dynamics of the Soul's Domain [Swedenborg [1740-1741] 1955], part 1, 86). This color logic can still be seen in palettes today that range from white through various colors to black. Aristotle's conjectures were repeated with various modifications by influential theorists such as François d'Aguilon (1567-1617) and the polymathic Athanasius Kircher (1602-1680), two of whose books Swedenborg had in his personal library. Isaac Newton (1642-1727), in his fourth edition of Opticks, book 1, part 2, proposition 1, theorem 1, specifically denied the validity of this "light and shadow" theory of color, but it persisted into the 1800s, attracting even such a brilliant proponent as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832). (In Swedenborg's Spiritual Experiences [Swedenborg 1978] <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1042/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_6064" target=_top>6064</a>, Newton informs Swedenborg in a conversation in the afterlife that all colors arise from white, red, and black. Compare Draft of "Supplements" [Swedenborg 1997] 291, in which Newton recants the theory of color he published in his lifetime on earth.) Swedenborg's own theory of colors varied considerably over his scientific career and was never set out definitively there; the portion of his last work touching on the topic, Draft on the Five Senses (Swedenborg 1976b) 335-377, 415, is barely more than an outline, and thus is for the most part highly obscure. For his other writings on color, see Draft on Fire and Colors (Swedenborg 1992, 9-16); Chemistry and Physics (Swedenborg [1721] 1976d, 127-132); Basic Principles of Nature, part 3, chapter 5, 20-21 (Swedenborg [1734] 1988; 2:295-299).

I have set My bow in the cloud. This signifies the state of the regenerated spiritual man, which is like a rainbow. Anyone may wonder that the "bow in the cloud" or the rainbow, is taken in the Word 
for a token of the covenant, seeing that the rainbow is nothing but an appearance arising from the modification of the rays of sunlight in raindrops, and thus only something natural, unlike other signs 
of the covenant in the church, mentioned just above. And that the "bow in the cloud" represents regeneration, and signifies the state of the regenerated spiritual man, cannot be known to anyone unless 
it be given him to see and hence to know how the case is. Spiritual angels, who have all been regenerated men of the spiritual church, when presented to sight as such in the other life, appear with 
as it were a rainbow about the head. But the rainbows seen are in accordance with their state, and thus from them their quality is known in heaven and in the world of spirits. The reason that the appearance 
of a rainbow is seen is that their natural things corresponding to their spiritual present such an appearance. It is a modification of spiritual light from the Lord in their natural things. These 
angels are those who are said to be regenerated "of water and the spirit" but the celestial angels are said to be regenerated "with fire."  [2] As regards natural colors, the existence of color requires 
something both dark and light, or black and white. When rays of sunlight fall on this, according to the varied tempering of the dark and the light, or of the black and the white, from the modification 
of the inflowing rays of light, colors are produced, some of which partake more and some less of the dark and black, and some more and some less of the light and white; and hence is their diversity. 
To speak comparatively, it is the same in spiritual things. The darkness in this case is the Own of man's intellectual part, or falsity; and the blackness is the Own of his will part, or evil; 
which absorb and extinguish the rays of light. But the lightness and whiteness is the truth and good that the man supposes he does of himself, which reflects and throws back from itself the rays of light. 
The rays of light that fall upon these, and as it were modify them, are from the Lord, as from the Sun of wisdom and intelligence; for rays of spiritual light are no other and from no other source. 
It is because natural things correspond to spiritual that when what is about a regenerate spiritual man is presented to view in the other life, it appears like the bow in the cloud, this bow being 
the representation of his spiritual things in his natural things. There is in the regenerate spiritual man an Own of the understanding into which the Lord insinuates innocence, charity and mercy. According 
to the reception of these gifts by the man is the appearance of his rainbow when presented to view-beautiful in proportion to the degree in which the Own of his will is removed, subdued, and reduced 
to obedience.  [3] By the prophets also, when they were in the vision of God, there was seen a bow as in a cloud. As by Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Above the expanse that was over the head of the cherubs was 
the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a Man upon it above; and I saw as the appearance of burning coal, 
as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of His loins and upward; and from the appearance of His loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there 
was brightness round about Him; as the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about; this was the appearance of the likeness of the 
glory of Jehovah (Ezek. 1:26-28).It must be evident to everyone that it is the Lord who was thus seen, and also that by Him was represented heaven, for He is heaven, that is, He is the all in all things 
of heaven. He is the "Man" here spoken of; the "throne" is heaven; the "burning coal as the appearance of fire from the loins and upward" is the celestial of love; the "brightness as of fire round 
about from the loins downward, as the bow in the cloud" is the celestial spiritual. Thus the celestial heaven, or the heaven of the celestial angels, is represented from the loins upward, and the spiritual 
heaven, or the heaven of the spiritual angels, is represented from the loins downward. For in the Grand Man what is below, from the loins down through the feet to the soles, signifies what is 
natural. Hence also it is evident that the natural things of man thus illuminated by spiritual light from the Lord, appear as the bow in the cloud. The like was seen also by John (Rev. 4:2-3; 10:1). </p>

'I have given My bow in the cloud' means the state of a regenerate spiritual person, who is like a rainbow. Anyone may wonder that in the Word 'the bow in the cloud', or the rainbow, is taken as a sign 
of the covenant, for the rainbow is nothing else than something produced by the conversion of rays of sunlight in raindrops. It is a wholly natural phenomenon, unlike other signs of the covenant in 
the Church mentioned just above. But the fact that 'the bow in the cloud' represents regeneration and means the state of a regenerate spiritual person, nobody is able to know unless he is allowed to 
see and consequently know what exactly is involved. When spiritual angels, who have all been regenerate members of the spiritual Church, are in the next life manifested visibly as such, there appears 
around their head a rainbow so to speak. But the rainbows which appear accord completely with their state, and from this also their characters are recognized in heaven and in the world of spirits. The 
reason the likeness of a rainbow appears is that their natural things corresponding to spiritual present such visible shape. It is a conversion of spiritual light from the Lord within their natural things. 
These angels are those said to have been 'regenerated by water and the spirit' while celestial angels are those said to have been 'regenerated with fire'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the case of; natural things, 
so that colour may be produced something dark and light, or black and white, is necessary. When rays of light from the sun fall on this, depending on the varying composition of the dark and light, or 
black and white, colours are produced from the modification of the inflowing rays of light. Some of those colours draw more, others less, on the dark and black, and some more, or less, on the light and 
white; and this is what gives rise to diversity of colour. Something comparable to this exists in spiritual things. In their case the intellectual side of the proprium, or falsity, constitutes 'the 
dark', and the will side of the proprium, or evil, which absorbs and extinguishes rays of light constitutes 'the black'. As for the 'light and white', these are the truth or good which a person imagines 
he does from himself, which reflects and casts back from itself the rays of light. The rays of light which fall on those things and so to speak modify them come from the Lord as the Sun of wisdom 
and intelligence; for the rays of spiritual light are no other and have no other source. It is because natural things correspond to spiritual that when in the next life that which is around a regenerate 
spiritual person is manifested visibly, there appears that which is similar to a bow in a cloud. This bow is a representation of the spiritual things present within his natural things. With the regenerate 
spiritual person an intellectual side of the proprium exists into which the Lord instills innocence, charity, and mercy. As is the person's reception of these gifts so is the appearance of his 
rainbow when manifested visibly - the more beautiful the more that the will side of his proprium has been taken away, disciplined, and reduced to a state of obedience.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 When the prophets had a 
vision of God, a bow as if in a cloud was also seen by them, as in Ezekiel's vision,  </p>
<blockquote>
Above the firmament that was over the heads of the cherubim, in appearance like a sapphire stone, there was the 
likeness of a throne, and above the likeness of a throne, there was a likeness as it were of the appearance of a Man (Homo) upon it above. And I saw as it were the shape of coal burning bright, as the 
appearance of fire, within it round about from the appearance of His loins upwards. And from the appearance of His loins and downwards I saw as it were the appearance of fire, whose brightness was 
round about it, like the appearance of the bow when it is in the cloud on the day of rain; so was the appearance of brightness round about; this was the appearance of the likeness of the Glory of Jehovah. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%201:26-28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 1:26-28</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>It may be clear to anyone that it was the Lord who was seen in this vision, and that on that occasion He represented heaven, for He Himself is heaven, that is, the All in all of 
heaven. He Himself is the 'Man' mentioned here, 'the throne' is heaven, 'the coal burning bright, as the appearance of fire, from the loins upwards' is the celestial element of love, 'the brightness 
of fire round about from the loins downwards, like the bow in the cloud' is the celestial-spiritual. In this way the celestial heaven, or heaven of celestial angels, was represented from the loins upwards, 
and the spiritual heaven, or heaven of spiritual angels, from the loins downwards. In fact the things that are below, from the loins down to the soles of the feet, mean in the Grand Man natural 
things. From this it is also clear that, when thus enlightened by spiritual light from the Lord, the natural things in man take on the appearance of 'the bow in the cloud'. The same appeased to John as 
well, see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%204:2,%203;%2010:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 4:2, 3; 10:1</a>. </p>

'Arcum Meum dedi in nube': quod significet statum hominis regenerati spiritualis, qui instar arcus iridis est: quisque mirari potest quod arcus in nube seu iris in Verbo accipiatur pro signo foederis, 
cum iris non aliud sit quam quoddam exsurgens ex modificatione radiorum lucis a sole tunc in guttis aquae pluviae, nec aliud quam naturale quoddam, nec sicut alia signa foederis in Ecclesia, de quibus 
mox prius:  sed quod 'arcus in nube' repraesentet regenerationem, et significet statum hominis regenerati spiritualis, non alicui notum esse potest nisi cui datum videre et inde scire quomodo se res 
habet.  Angeli spirituales, qui omnes fuerunt homines Ecclesiae spiritualis regenerati, in altera vita cum sistuntur conspiciendi ita, apparet circum caput sicut arcus iridis; sed irides quae apparent, 
se habent prorsus secundum statum eorum, inde etiam cognoscuntur in caelo et in mundo spirituum quales sunt: quod instar iridis appareat, causa est quod naturalia eorum correspondentia spiritualibus 
talem speciem sistant; est modificatio lucis spiritualis a Domino, in eorum naturalibus; hi angeli sunt qui dicuntur 'regenerati aqua et spiritu,' angeli vero caelestes 'regenerati igne.' In naturalibus 
ita se habet: [2] ut color existat, debet esse quoddam obscurum et niveum, seu nigrum et album, in quae cum radii lucis ex sole incidunt, secundum variam temperaturam obscuri et nivei, seu nigri 
et albi, ex modificatione radiorum lucis influentium, existunt colores, quorum quidam magis aut minus trahunt ex obscuro et nigro, quidam magis aut minus ex niveo seu albo, inde diversitas eorum; comparative 
se habet res in spiritualibus; ibi 'obscurum' est proprium intellectuale seu falsum. et 'nigrum' est proprium voluntarium hominis seu malum, quod absorbet et exstinguit radios lucis; at 'niveum 
et album' est verum et bonum quod homo putat facere ex semet, quod reflectit et rejicit a se radios lucis; radii lucis qui in illa incidunt et illa quasi modificant, sunt a Domino, ut a sole sapientiae 
et intelligentiae, nam radii lucis spiritualis non alii sunt nec aliunde: quia naturalia correspondent spiritualibus, inde est cum circa hominem regeneratum spiritualem in altera vita sistatur ita 
videndum, quod appareat simile arcui in nube, qui arcus est repraesentatio spiritualium in ejus naturalibus: apud hominem regeneratum spiritualem est proprium intellectuale, cui Dominus insinuat innocentiam, 
charitatem et misericordiam; secundum receptionem horum honorum ab homine, apparet ejus iris, cum sistitur videnda, eo pulchrior quo magis proprium voluntarium hominis remotum, subactum, et 
in obsequium redactum est.  [3] Prophetis cum in visione Dei fuerant, apparuit quoque arcus sicut qui in nube, ut Ezechieli, 	Supra expansum, quod super capite cheruborum, quasi aspectus lapidis sapphiri,
