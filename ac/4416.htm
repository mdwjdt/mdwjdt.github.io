<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4416节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4416.</strong>在来世，灵人的品质从他们所在的光明显可知，因为如前所述，他们藉以看见的光就对应于他们藉以领悟的光。那些认识真理，也已经确认过它们，却仍过着邪恶生活的人，看似居于雪白的光中，但像冬光那样寒冷。当他们靠近那些居于天堂之光的人时，他们自己的光就彻底变暗，变成漆黑。当他们远离天堂之光时，就有一种像硫磺发出的那种劣质黄光取而代之，他们本人在这光中看似幽灵，他们的真理看似缥缈的影子。因为他们的真理伴有虚假的信仰，这种信仰具有这样的性质：他们信真理，仅仅因为他们能由此赚得地位、利益和名声。真理是什么对他们来说无所谓，只要接受它就行。<br />然而，那些陷入邪恶，并由此陷入虚假的人则看似居于炭火所发出的劣质光中；这光在接受天堂之光时，就彻底变得幽暗。不过，这些人藉以看见的光照着他们所陷入的虚假与邪恶而各不相同。由此还能看出为何过着邪恶生活的人绝无可能拥有发自诚心的对神性真理的信仰；因为他们就居于充满烟雾的光中，当天堂之光照在上面时，这光就向他们变暗，以致他们既无法用自己的眼睛看见，又无法用自己的心灵看见。与此同时，他们还会遭受极度痛苦，有些人则陷入一种无意识状态。正因如此，恶者绝无可能接受真理，只有善者才能接受。<br />过着邪恶生活的人无法相信他竟然在这样劣质的光中，因为他看不见他的灵所在的光，只看见他的眼睛视觉所在，以及他的属世心智由此所在的光。他若能看见其灵的光，并能发现倘若来自天堂的真理与良善之光真的流入其灵之光，这光会变成什么样子，那么就会清楚知道他距离接受属这光的事物，也就是信的事物何等遥远，距离吸收仁爱的事物更是何等遥远，因而距离天堂何等遥远。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4416</b></p><p><b>4416.</b>
The quality of spirits in the other life is evident from the light in which they are, for as before said the light in which they see corresponds to the light by which they perceive. They who have known 
truths and have also confirmed them with themselves, and yet have lived a life of evil, appear in a snowy light, but cold, like the light of winter; and when they approach those who are in the light 
of heaven, their light is then completely darkened, and becomes pitch-dark; and when they remove themselves from the light of heaven, there succeeds a yellow light as from sulphur, in which they appear 
like specters, and their truths like phantasms. For their truths had been those of persuasive faith, which is of such a nature that they had believed because believing led to honor, gain, and reputation, 
and it was all the same to them what the truth was, provided it was received.  [2] But they who are in evil and thence in falsities, appear in a light like that of a charcoal fire. This light 
becomes quite dusky in the light of heaven; but the very lights from which they see are varied in accordance with the falsity and evil in which they are. This showed very plainly why those who lead a 
life of evil can never have faith in Divine truths from a sincere heart; for they are in that smoky light which, when heavenly light falls upon it, becomes dark to them, so that they see neither with 
their eyes nor with their mind; and besides they then fall into agonies, and some into a kind of swoon. Hence it is that the evil cannot possibly receive truth, but only the good.  [3] The man who leads 
a life of evil cannot believe that he is in such a light, because he cannot see the light in which his spirit is, but only that in which is the sight of his eyes and from this his natural mind. But 
if he could see the light of his spirit, and could make proof of what it would become if the light of truth and good from heaven were to flow into it, he would then very well know how far he is from 
receiving the things which are of this light, that is, those which are of faith, and how much further he is from becoming imbued with those which are of charity, thus how far distant he is from heaven. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4416</b></p><p><b>4416.</b>
The character of spirits in the next life is apparent from the light in which they dwell, for, as has been stated, the light by which they see corresponds to the light by which they perceive. People 
who have been acquainted with truths and have also substantiated them, and yet have led a life of evil, are seen to dwell in light which is white as snow, yet cold like the light of winter. But when such 
people approach those who dwell in the light of heaven their own light becomes thoroughly darkened and turns into pitch darkness. And when they withdraw from the light of heaven an inferior yellow 
light like that from sulphur takes its place, in which they themselves look like ghosts and their truths like ethereal shapes. For their truths have accompanied a false faith, the nature of this faith 
being such that they believed truths, but only because they thereby earned position, gain, and reputation. It made no difference to them what the truth may have been; all that mattered was the acceptance 
of it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Those however who are under the influence of evil and consequently of falsities are seen dwelling in an inferior light like that of a charcoal fire. This becomes a thoroughly murky 
light when it comes near the light of heaven. But the light by which those people see varies according to the falsity and evil which govern them. From this one could also see why people who lead a life 
of evil cannot possibly have faith in Divine truths that springs from sincerity of heart, for they are dwelling in that smoke-filled light which, when heavenly light falls upon it, becomes dark to 
them, as a result of which they see neither with their eyes nor with their mind. At the same time they suffer intense pains and some sink into a kind of unconsciousness. Consequently the evil cannot possibly 
accept truth, only the good can. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Someone who is leading a life of evil is incapable of believing that he dwells in an inferior light like that because he is not able to see the light in 
which his spirit dwells, only the light in which the sight of his eye and consequently his natural mind dwells. But if he could see the light of his spirit and could find out what it would then become 
if the light of truth and good from heaven were to flow into it, he would know full well how far away he was from receiving the things of light, that is, matters of faith, and how much farther away 
he was from assimilating the things of charity, and so how distant he was from heaven. </p>

</p><b>4416.</b>
Spiritus in altera vita ex luce in qua sunt, apparent quales sunt, nam lux in qua vident, correspondet luci ex qua percipiunt, ut dictum est {1}: qui vera sciverunt et quoque illa confirmaverunt 
apud se et tamen vitam mali vixerunt, illi apparent in luce nivea sed frigida, qualis est lux hiemalis; at {2} cum ad illos qui in luce caeli sunt, accedunt, tunc illorum lux prorsus obtenebratur et 
fit caliginosa; et cum removent se a luce caeli, succedit lumen flavum sicut ex sulphure, in quo apparent tanquam spectra ac vera illorum sicut phantasmata; nam vera eorum fuerunt fidei persuasivae, 
quae talis est ut crediderint quia illis honor, lucrum et fama inde, et illis perinde fuerit quid verum, modo receptum.  [2] Qui autem in malo sunt et inde in falsis, apparent in lumine tanquam 
ignis carbonarei; hoc lumen fit prorsus {3} furvum ad lucem caeli; sed ipsa lumina ex quibus vident, variantur secundum falsum et malum in quibus sunt.  (s)Inde etiam patuit cur illi qui vitam mali 
agunt {4}, nusquam possint veris Divinis fidem (o)ex sincero corde habere; sunt enim in lumine illo fumoso, in quod cum lux caelestis incidit, fit illis tenebricosum, ut nec videant oculis nec videant 
mente et praeterea tunc in angores, et quidam quasi in deliquia cadunt; inde est quod mali {5} nusquam recipere possint verum, sed unice boni'.  [3] Homo qui vitam mali agit, non credere potest 
quod in tali lumine sit, quia non videre {6} lumen in quo ejus spiritus est, sed modo lumen in quo ejus oculi {7} visus et inde ejus mens naturalis; at si videret lumen spiritus sui et experiretur 
qualis fieret, si lux veri et boni e caelo in id influeret, sciret manifeste quam longe {8} abesset a recipiendis illis quae sunt lucis, hoc est, quae sunt fidei, et magis ab imbuendis illis quae 
sunt charitatis, ita quantum distaret a caelo.(s)      @1 ut dictum after vident$      @2 hyemis, sed$      @3 quoque fit$      @4 vivunt$      @5 verum nusquam possit recipi a malis, sed unice 
a bonis$      @6 videt$      @7 A d oculi$      @8 longissime$ </p>
