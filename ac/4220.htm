<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4220节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4220.</strong>在来世，那些活在肉身期间就已接受主的神性事物，也就是祂对全人类的爱之人，因而那些已接受对邻之仁的人，以及那些已接受回以主的爱之人，都会被赐予聪明和智慧，以及无法形容的幸福。因为他们成为天使，因而成为最真正意义上的人。但在来世，那些活在肉身期间没有接受主的神性事物，也就是对人类的爱，更没有接受回以主的爱，而是只爱、甚至只拜自己，因而以属于自我和尘世的事物为其目的之人则截然不同。短暂的时期过后，那些人就丧失了一切聪明，彻底变得愚蠢，就在地狱中愚蠢者之列。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4220</b></p><p><b>4220.</b>
They who in the life of the body have received the Divine things of the Lord, that is, His love toward the universal human race; and consequently they who have received charity toward the neighbor; and 
also they who have received reciprocal love to the Lord, are in the other life endowed with intelligence and wisdom, and with ineffable happiness; for they become angels and thus truly men. But they 
who in the life of the body have not received the Divine things of the Lord, that is, who have not received love toward the human race, and still less reciprocal love to the Lord, but who have loved 
and indeed worshiped themselves only, and consequently have had as their end what is of self and of the world, they, in the other life, after some brief passages of life there, are deprived of all intelligence, 
and become utterly stupid, being among the stupid infernals there. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4220</b></p><p><b>4220.</b>
In the next life those who during their lifetime have been receiving Divine things which are the Lord's - that is, who have been receiving His love towards the whole human race, and so those who have 
been receiving charity towards the neighbour, also those who have been receiving reciprocal love to the Lord - are granted intelligence and wisdom, and indescribable happiness. For they become angels 
and thus human beings in the truest sense. But the lot in the next life of those who during their lifetime have not been receiving Divine things which are the Lord's - that is, those who have not been 
receiving His love towards the human race, let alone reciprocal love to the Lord, but have loved, indeed worshipped, only themselves, and as a consequence have had as their end in view the things which 
belong to self and the world - is different. After a few short periods there those people are deprived of all intelligence and become utterly stupid, being among the stupid ones in hell. </p>

Qui in vita corporis Divina quae sunt Domini, receperant, hoc est, qui amorem Ipsius erga universum genus humanum, proinde {1} qui charitatem erga proximum, et qui amorem reciprocum in Dominum, illi 
in altera vita donantur intelligentia et sapientia, et felicitate ineffabili, nam fiunt angeli, ita vere homines; at qui in vita corporis Divina quae sunt Domini, non receperant, hoc est, non amorem 
erga genus humanum, minus amorem reciprocum in Dominum, sed solum semet amarunt, immo coluerunt, et consequenter pro fine habuerunt illa quae sunt sui et mundi, illi in altera vita, post exactos 
breves curriculos vitae ibi, privantur omni intelligentia, et fiunt stupidissimi, ac sunt ibi inter infernales stupidos.      @1 ita$ </p>
