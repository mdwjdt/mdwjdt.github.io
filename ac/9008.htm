<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9008节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9008.</strong>“那人必死”表诅咒。这从“必死”的含义清楚可知，“必死”是指诅咒（参看<a href="5407.htm">5407</a>，<a href="6119.htm">6119</a>，<a href="7494.htm">7494</a>节）。“死”之所以表示诅咒，是因为对那些受到诅咒的人来说，信之真理和爱之良善已经灭绝了。这些构成一个人所拥有的最真实的生命，因为它们是从主那里所领受的，而主是唯一的生命源头。当它们灭绝时，虚假和邪恶就会取而代之；而虚假和邪恶因是构成生命的真理和良善的对立面，故构成死亡；这死亡是属灵的死亡，就是诅咒、地狱和永恒的不幸。那些沉浸于邪恶和虚假的人，也就是那些在地狱里的人之所以继续活着，是因为他们生而为人，因而拥有从主接受生命的能力。他们从主接受生命的量，仅能使他们思考、推理、说话，由此使他们的邪恶看似良善，他们的虚假看似真理，从而赋予生命的表象。</p>

Dying he shall die. That this signifies damnation, is evident from the signification of "dying to die," as being damnation (see n. 5407, 6119, 7494). That "death" denotes damnation, is because with those 
who are damned the truths of faith and the goods of love have been extinguished, for these are what constitute the veriest life of man, because they are from the Lord who is the only source of life. 
When these have been extinguished, falsities and evils succeed in their place, which being opposite to the truths and goods that are of life, are therefore of death, but of spiritual death, which 
is damnation, hell, eternal unhappiness. That nevertheless those are alive who are in evils and falsities, or who are in hell, is because they have been born men, and therefore into the capacity of receiving 
life from the Lord; and also do receive so much of life from the Lord as to be able to think, reason, and speak, and thereby to cause the evil in themselves to appear as good, and the falsity 
as truth; and thus to live as semblances of life. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9008</b></p><p><b>9008.</b>
'Shall surely die' means damnation. This is clear from the meaning of 'surely dying' as damnation, dealt with in <a href="5407.htm">5407</a>, <a href="6119.htm">6119</a>, <a href="7494.htm">7494</a>. The reason why 'death' means damnation is that with those who have been 
damned the truths of faith and forms of the good of charity have been wiped out. These are what constitute the most real kind of life a person has, for they are received from the Lord, who is the 
one and only source of life. When they have been wiped out their place is then taken by falsities and evils; and these, being the opposites of truths and forms of good which are the constituents of life, 
are therefore the constituents of death - spiritual death, which is damnation, hell, and eternal unhappiness The reason why those immersed in evils and falsities, that is, those who are in hell, continue 
to be alive is that they were born human beings and consequently have the ability to receive life from the Lord. And they do receive life from the Lord, as much life as will enable them to think, 
reason, and speak, to make their evil look like good and their falsity like truth, and so to give the appearance of life. </p>

`Moriendo morietur':  quod significet damnationem, constat ex significatione `moriendo mori' quod sit damnatio, de qua n. 5407, 6119, 7494; quod `mors' sit damnatio, est quia apud illos qui {1}damnati 
sunt, vera fidei et bona amoris exstincta sunt, illa enim sunt quae ipsissimam vitam hominis constituunt, nam sunt ex Domino, a Quo unice vita; cum (c)illa exstincta sunt, loco (c)illorum succedunt 
falsa et mala quae quia opposita sunt veris et bonis quae sunt vitae, ideo sunt mortis, sed mortis spiritualis, quae est damnatio, infernum, infelicitas aeterna; quod usque illi qui in malis et falsis 
{2}seu qui in inferno sunt vivant, est quia {3}homines nati sunt et inde in facultate recipiendi vitam a Domino, et quoque tantum vitae a Domino recipiunt ut possint cogitare, ratiocinari, et loqui, 
et per id sistere malum apud se ut appareat sicut bonum, ac falsum sicut verum, et sic agere simulacra vitae. @1 damnantur$ @2 sunt seu A, seu qui falsis I$ @3 inest facultas recipiendi a Domino vitam, 
quoniam nati sunt$ </p>
