<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8004节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8004.</strong>“不可把一点肉从房子里带到外头去”表该良善绝不可与另一种良善掺杂在一起。这从“从房子里带到外头”和“肉”的含义清楚可知：“从房子里带到外头”是指给别人吃，因而是指与不同于自己社群的另一种良善掺杂；“肉”是指良善（参看<a href="6968.htm">6968</a>，<a href="7850.htm">7850</a>节）。天上的社群照着人体的所有肢体、脏腑和器官所履行的功能而彼此不同，如前面许多章节末尾所示。每个肢体、脏腑和器官的功能都通过对应关系而与一种与众不同的特定种类的良善有关。由此明显可知，良善是多种多样的；为叫它们能产生不同的形式，这些形式合在一起构成最完美的天堂形式，这些良善绝不可掺杂在一起。因为如果它们掺杂在一起，每一个的独特性都会遭到破坏。这就是他们不可把一点肉从房子里带到外头去所表示的。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8004</b></p><p><b>8004.</b>
Thou shalt not bring out of the flesh abroad from the house. That this signifies that this good shall not be mixed together with the good of another, is evident from the signification of "to bring out 
abroad from the house" as being to give to another to eat, thus to mix with another good than that which belongs to the society; and from the signification of "flesh," as being good (see n. 6968, 7850). 
For the societies in heaven are distinct according to the functions of all the members, viscera, and organs in the body (as has been shown at the close of many chapters). By means of correspondence, 
the function of each member, viscus, and organ bears relation to a peculiar good distinct from any other. From this it is evident that goods are manifold, and that in order that from them distinct 
forms may arise, which taken together may constitute the most perfect form of heaven, they are by no means to be mixed together; for if they were mixed together the distinction would be lost. This is 
signified by the command that they should not bring out of the flesh abroad from the house. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8004</b></p><p><b>8004.</b>
'You shall not bring any of the flesh outside the house' means that this good must not be intermingled with another's good. This is clear from the meaning of 'bringing something outside the house' as 
giving it to another to eat, thus intermingling it with a variety of good different from that of their own community; and from the meaning of 'the flesh' as good, dealt with in <a href="6968.htm">6968</a>, <a href="7850.htm">7850</a>. The communities 
in heaven are all distinct from one another, in keeping with the functions performed by all the members and organs of the body, as was shown at the ends of quite a number of chapters. Through correspondence 
the function that each member or organ performs has connection with one particular variety of good that is distinct from another. From this it is evident that the varieties of good are manifold, 
and that they must never be intermingled if they are to give rise to distinct forms which, taken together, will constitute the absolutely perfect form of heaven. For if they were intermingled 
the distinctness of each would be destroyed. This is what is meant by their being forbidden to bring any of the flesh outside their house. </p>

</p><b>8004.</b>
`Non educes e domo de carne foras': quod significet quod bonum hoc non commiscebitur bono alterius, constat ex significatione `educere e domo foras' quod sit alteri dare ad comedendum, ita commiscere 
cum alio bono quam quod est suae societatis; et ex significatione `carnis' quod sit bonum, de qua n. 6968, 7850.  Sunt enim {1} societates in caelo distinctae secundum functiones (d)omnium membrorum, 
viscerum, et organorum in corpore, ut ad finem plurium capitum ostensum est; functio cujusvis membri, visceris, et organi per correspondentiam se refert ad peculiare bonum ab altero distinctum; {2}(x)exinde 
patet quod bona multiplicia sint, et quod, ut ex illis {3}distinctae formae existant, quae simul sumptae formam perfectissimam caeli constituent, {4}nequaquam commiscenda sint, nam si commiscerentur, 
periret {5} distinctio; hoc significatur per quod `non educerent e domo de carne foras.' 	@1 i omnes$ 	@2 quia tot genera boni sunt$ 	@3 forma constituatur$ 	@4 non commiscenda sunt$ 	@5 i omnis$ </p>
