<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10785节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10785</strong>.当来自该星球的天使灵映入眼帘时，他们和我们搭讪，问我们是谁，想要什么。我们说，我们是旅行者，我们的旅程把我们带到这里，他们无不必害怕我们。因为他们担心我们是那些让他们对神、信等等感到混乱之人中的一员；由于这些人，他们已经撤退到其星球的四分之一，以避开他们所能到的任何地方。当被问及是什么使他们感到混乱，他们回答说，是三的观念和神里面没有人性的神性的观念；然而，他们知道并发觉，神是一，也是一个人。于是我们意识到，那些干扰他们、令他们唯恐避之不及的人来自我们地球。我们还从以下事实意识到这一点：在来世，那些由于在世上就习惯热衷并喜欢旅行而以这种方式四处游逛的人，来自我们地球；因为其它星球的人不会进行这种旅行。后来我们得知，他们的访客是修道士，这些修道士曾为了让外邦人皈依而热情地周游我们的世界。于是，我们告诉这些灵人，他们避开这些访客是对的，因为他们的意图不是教导人，而是获得财富和统治权；他们的第一个目标是利用各种手段迷惑人们的心智，之后就会使他们沦为自己的奴隶。我们还告诉他们，他们不让这种人搅乱他们自己对神的概念的做法是正确的。</p>

When the angelic spirits who were from that earth came into view, they accosted us, asking who we were, and what we desired. We said that we were travelers, and that we had been conveyed thither, and 
that they need not be afraid of us. For they were afraid that we were of those who disturb them about God, about faith, and about other like things, on account of whom they had betaken themselves into 
that quarter of their earth, avoiding them wherever they could. They were asked by what those persons disturb them. They replied, "By the idea of Three, and by the idea of a Divinity in God without 
any Humanity, when yet they know and perceive that God is one, and that He is a Man. It was then perceived that those who disturbed them, and whom they fled from, were from our earth. This was perceived 
also from the fact that those in the other life who wander about in this way from an eagerness and delight in traveling which they contracted in the world, are from our earth; for on other earths there 
are no such travelings about. It was afterward found that their visitors were monks who had traveled about on our globe from a zeal for converting the Gentiles; and therefore we said that they do 
well to avoid them, because their intention is not to teach, but to get rich, and to rule; and that they first take pains to captivate the minds of others, and then they subject them to themselves as 
slaves. We also said that they do well in not suffering their own idea about the Lord to be disturbed by such persons. </p>

When the spirits belonging to that planet came into sight they addressed us. Who were we and what did we want? they asked. We said that we were travellers, that our journeys had brought us there, and 
that they should not be afraid of us. For they were afraid that we might be some of those who caused them to become muddled regarding God, faith, and the like, on account of whom they had retreated to 
that quarter of their planet, running away from them in whatever direction they could. When asked what it was that caused them to become muddled, they replied that it was the idea of Three and the idea 
that within God Divinity exists without Humanity, when yet they knew and perceived that God was One and also Man (Homo). We realized then that those who caused them to become muddled and whom they 
ran away from belonged to our planet. We also realized it from the fact that those from our planet who wander around in that fashion in the next life do so on account of their enthusiasm for and delight 
in travel which they acquired in the world; for those on other planets do not engage in such travels. After this we learned that they were monks who had travelled about our world with a zeal for converting 
gentiles. We therefore told those spirits that they did right to run away from them, because they were not intent on teaching people but on gain and dominion; their first aim was to use various 
means to capture people's minds, but after that to make those people subject to them as slaves. We also told them that they did right not to allow such persons to make them muddled in their ideas 
about the Lord.  </p>

Cum spiritus angelici qui ab illa tellure, venerunt in conspectum, alloquebantur nos, quaerentes quinam essemus et quid vellemus; dicebamus quod peregrinationis causa, et quod illuc delati, et ne timeant 
a nobis; timebant enim quod essemus ex illis qui perturbant eos de Deo, de fide, et de similibus, propter quod in illam plagam telluris suae se contulerunt, fugientes eos quocumque possent; interrogati 
per quae perturbant, respondebant per ideam Trium (c)et per ideam Divini absque Humano in Deo, cum tamen sciunt et percipiunt quod Deus sit unus, et quod sit Homo; perceptum tunc quod illi qui 
perturbarunt eos, et quos fugerunt, fuerint ex nostra tellure; {1}tum etiam ex eo quod ex nostra tellure sint qui ita circumvagantur in altera vita, ex studio et jucundo peregrinationis quod contraxerunt 
in mundo, in aliis enim telluribus non tales peregrinationes sunt; compertum dein est quod esset monachi qui ex studio convertendi gentes in nostro orbe peregrinati sunt; quapropter dicebamus illis 
quod bene faciant quod fugiant illos, quia intentio illorum non est docere sed lucrari et dominari; et quod per {2}varia primum captare animos {3}studeant, sed dein subjicere illos sibi sicut servos. 
Praeterea dicebamus quod bene faciant, quod non patiantur ideam suam de Domino a talibus perturbari. @1 nam ex nostra tellure sunt$ @2 talia$ @3 velint, et sic$ </p>
