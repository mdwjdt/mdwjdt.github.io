<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8913节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8913.</strong>出埃及记20:15-17.众百姓见响声（雷轰）、火把（闪电）、号角的响声和冒着烟的山；百姓看见就都颤抖，远远地站着。他们对摩西说，求你和我们说话，我们必听，不要神和我们说话，恐怕我们死亡。摩西对百姓说，不要惧怕；因为神降临是要试验你们，并且对祂的惧怕可以在你们面前，使你们不致犯罪。<br />“众百姓见响声（雷轰）、火把（闪电）”表源于良善的神之真理的觉知。“号角的响声”表穿过天堂的这些真理。“和冒着烟的山”表真理之良善本身，这良善若不以外在形式，是感知不到的。“百姓看见就都颤抖”表当它们被接受时所发生的震颤。“远远地站着”表远离内在事物。“他们对摩西说”表抱怨。“求你和我们说话，我们必听”表接受以一种调整过的形式出现的真理，他们将服从这种形式的真理。“不要神和我们说话”表以一种未经调整过的形式出现的真理。“恐怕我们死亡”表这种形式将毁灭与他们同在的天堂生命。“摩西对百姓说”表信息。“不要惧怕；因为神降临是要试验你们”表天堂的生命不会灭亡；试验他们只是为了叫人知道天堂生命的存在和性质。“并且对祂的惧怕可以在你们面前，使你们不致犯罪”表随之对神性的神圣敬畏和由此而来的对属灵生命的保存。</p>

Verses 15-17. And all the people saw the voices, and the torches, and the voice of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking; and the people saw, and they quaked, and stood afar off. And they said unto Moses, 
speak thou with us, and we will hear; and let not God speak with us, lest perchance we die. And Moses said unto the people, Fear not; because God is come to tempt you, and that the fear of Him may 
be before your faces, that ye sin not. "And all the people saw the voices, and the torches," signifies the perception of truths Divine from good; "and the voice of the trumpet," signifies the same 
things through heaven; "and the mountain smoking," signifies the good itself of truth not perceptible except in the external form; "and the people saw, and they quaked," signifies the tremor which there 
is when they are received; "and they stood afar off," signifies remoteness from internal things; "and they said unto Moses," signifies complaint; "Speak thou with us," signifies the reception of truth 
in an accommodated form, which in this manner they would obey; "and let not God speak with us," signifies truth in a form not accommodated; "lest perchance we die," signifies that thus the life of 
heaven with them would perish; "and Moses said unto the people," signifies information; "Fear not, because God has come to tempt you," signifies that the life of heaven will not perish; this is merely 
that it may be known that it exists, and what is its quality; "and that the fear of Him may be before your faces, that ye sin not," signifies holy fear therefrom of the Divine, and the consequent preservation 
of spiritual life. </p>

Verses 18-20 And all the people saw the voices and torches,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and the voice of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking; and the people saw and were violently shaken, and stood afar off. And they said to 
Moses, Speak yourself to us, and we will hear; and do not let God speak to us, lest perhaps we die. And Moses said to the people, Do not fear, for God has come in order to test you, and in order that 
His fear may be before your faces, so that you do not sin. </p>
<p>'And all the people saw the voices and torches' means perception of God's truths that spring from good. 'And the voice of the trumpet' means 
those same truths going through heaven. 'And the mountain smoking means the good itself of truth, which cannot be perceived except in an outward form. 'And the people saw and were violently shaken' 
means the quivering that takes place when they are received. 'And stood afar off' means remoteness from internal things. 'And they said to Moses' means complaint. 'Speak yourself to us, [and we will 
hear]' means the reception of truth in an adjusted form, which - in that form - they will obey. 'And do not let God speak to us' means truth in an unadjusted form. 'Lest perhaps we die' means that this 
form will destroy the life of heaven with them. 'And Moses said to the people' means an informing. 'Do not fear, for God has come in order to test you' means that the life of heaven will not be destroyed, 
[but that they are tested] solely so that the existence and essential nature of that life may be known. 'And in order that His fear may be before your faces, and you do not sin' means consequent 
holy fear of the Divine, and preservation of spiritual life as a result.

Vers. 15-17.  Et omnis populus videntes voces et faces, et vocem buccinae, et montem fumantem; et vidit populus, et commoti sunt, et steterunt e longinquo.  Et dixerunt ad Moschen, Loquere tu cum nobis, 
et audiemus, et ne loquatur cum nobis Deus, ne forte moriamur.  Et dixit Moschen ad populum, Ne timeatis, quia propterea ut tentare vos, venit Deus, et propterea ut sit timor Ipsius coram faciebus 
vestris, ut non peccetis. `Et omnis populus videntes voces et faces' significat perceptionem verorum Divinorum ex bono: `et vocem buccinae' significat eadem per caelum: `et montem fumantem' significat 
ipsum bonum veri non perceptibile nisi in externa forma: `et vidit populus et commoti sunt significat tremorem, qui est cum recipiuntur: `et steterunt e longinquo' significat remotionem ab internis: 
`et dixerunt ad Moschen' significat querimoniam: `Loquere tu cum nobis' significat receptionem veri in forma accommodata cui sic oboedituros: `et ne loquatur cum nobis Deus' significat verum in forma 
non accommodata {1}: `ne forte moriamur' significat quod peritura sic vita caeli apud illos: `et dixit Moscheh ad populum' significat informationem: `Ne timeatis, quia propterea ut tentare vos, venit 
Deus' significat quod non peritura vita caeli, solum ut sciatur quod illa sit et qualis: `et propterea ut sit timor Ipsius coram faciebus vestris, et {2} non peccetis' significat timorem sanctum inde 
pro Divino, et inde vitae spiritualis conservationem. @1 vide nubes written in m$ @2 ut IT$ </p>
