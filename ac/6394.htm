<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6394节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6394.</strong>“成为服劳役的仆人”表使他能赚取功德。这从“成为服劳役的仆人”的含义清楚可知，“成为服劳役的仆人”是指服从并服务。由于经上论到那些想要通过行为或工作赚取功德的人说，他们“是瘦骨嶙峋的驴，卧在重驮之间”，并且他“屈肩背重”，所以“成为服劳役的仆人”也表示那些想要通过行为或工作赚取功德的人；因为他们是最低级的仆人，如前所示（<a href="6389.htm">6389</a>节）。“成为服劳役的仆人”表示服从和服务，这一点清楚可见于摩西五经：<br />你临近一座城要攻打它的时候，要向他们宣告和平；那城若以和平回答你，给你开了城，城里所有的人都要给你服劳役，服事你。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申20.10.htm">20:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申20.11.htm">11</a>）<br />耶利米哀歌：<br />先前在人民中为大的城，现在何等孤独！她竟如寡妇！先前在列族中为大，在诸省掌权的，现在竟成为服劳役的！（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀1.1.htm">1:1</a>）<br />在这些经文中，很明显，“成为服劳役的”和“劳役”表示服务。马太福音：<br />耶稣说，西门，你的意思如何？世上的君王，向谁征收关税丁税。是向自己的儿子呢？是向外人呢？彼得对祂说，是向外人。耶稣就对他说，那么，儿子就可以免税了。但恐怕触犯他们，你且往海边投个钓钩，把先上来的鱼拿起来，开了它的口，必得一块钱，可以拿去替我和你给他们。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.25.htm">17:25</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.27.htm">27</a>）<br />此处“纳关税”或“丁税表示那些服务的人，故经上说“外人要纳，儿子就可以免税了”，因为外人是仆人（参看<a href="1097.htm">1097</a>节）。彼得从海里拿上来一条鱼，在它的口里找到纳税的一块钱，代表这一事实：属世层的最低级部分，即仆人，要如此行同，或完成这事；因为“鱼”表示属世层的这个部分。</p>

And he shall be a servant to tribute. That this signifies that he may have merit, is evident from the signification of "being a servant to tribute," as being to be subject and to serve; and as it is 
said of those who desire to have merit through works that they are "bony asses, lying down between burdens," and that "he bows the shoulder to bear," by "being a servant to tribute" are also signified 
those who desire to have merit through works; for that they are lowest services was shown above (n. 6389). That "serving to tribute" denotes to be subject and to serve, is evident in Moses: </p>
<p>     When 
thou drawest nigh unto a city to fight against it, thou shalt invite them unto peace; and it shall be, if it answer thee for peace, and open to thee, it shall be that all the people that is found therein 
shall become for tribute to thee, and shall serve thee (Deut. 20:10, 11). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     How hath the city dwelt solitary that was great in people! She is become as a widow. She that was great 
among the nations, who ruled in the provinces, she is become tributary (Lam. 1:1);  where it is plain that by "becoming for tribute," and by "tributary," is signified serving. In Matthew: </p>
<p>     Jesus 
said, How seemeth it to thee, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth receive tribute or tax? of their own sons, or of strangers? Peter saith to Him, Of strangers. Jesus saith to him, Therefore 
the sons are free. But lest we should be a stumbling-block to them, go thou to the sea, and cast a hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened its mouth thou shalt find 
a piece of money; that take, and give it for Me and thee (Matt. 17:25-27); </p>
<p>here also by "giving tribute," or "tax," are meant those who serve, and therefore it is said that "strangers should give and 
sons should be free," for strangers were servants (see n. 1097). That Peter should take up a fish out of the sea and should find in its month a piece of money which he was to give, represented that the 
lowest natural, which serves, should do this; for "fishes" signify this natural. </p>

'And will be one serving for tribute' means so that he may earn merit. This is clear from the meaning of 'being one serving for tribute' as being subject to and serving. And since those who wish to earn 
merit through works are spoken of as bony asses lying down between burdens and as those who bend their shoulder to bear a burden, 'one serving for tribute' too means those who wish to earn merit through 
works; for they are lowest-ranking servants, see above in <a href="6389.htm">6389</a>. The fact that 'one serving for tribute' means being subject to and serving is clear in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
When you draw near a city to fight 
against it you shall proclaim peace to them.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> But it shall be, if it responds to you in favour of peace and opens up to you - it shall be, that all the people who are found in it will become tribute 
to you and serve you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2020:10,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 20:10, 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
How lonely dwells the city [that was] great with people! She has become like a widow, [she who was] great among the nations; she who had dominion 
over provinces has become a payer of tribute. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lam%201:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lam 1:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In these places it is self-evident that 'becoming a tribute' and 'becoming a payer of tribute' mean serving. In Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said, 
How does it seem to you, Simon? The kings of the earth, from whom do they receive tribute or tax, from their own sons or from strangers? Peter said to Him, From strangers. Jesus said to him, Then the 
sons are free; but so that we may not offend them, set off for the sea and cast a hook, and take the fish that comes up first. Open its mouth and you will find a stater;<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> take it and give it for Me 
and for you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2017:25-27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 17:25-27</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'giving tribute moneys or taxation' means those who serve, and therefore it says that strangers were to give it but the sons would be free; for strangers were 
servants, <a href="1097.htm">1097</a>. Peter's taking a fish from the sea and his finding in its mouth a stater which he was to give represented the fact that the lowest part of the natural, which is a servant, would accomplish 
it; for that part of the natural is meant by 'fish'.

`Et erit tributo serviens': quod significet ut mereatur, (x)constat ex significatione `esse tributo serviens' quod sit subjectum esse et servire; et quia de illis qui mereri volunt per opera, dicitur 
quod sint `asini ossei, cubantes inter sarcinas', et quod (x)inclinent humerum ad bajulandum, (x)ideo per `tributo servientem' etiam significantur qui per opera mereri volunt, {1}nam quod illi sint 
servitia infima, videatur supra n. 6389.  Quod `tributo servire' sit subjectus esse et servire, constat apud Mosen, Quando accedis ad urbem ad oppugnandum eam, invitabis  eos ad pacem: fiat autem si 
pro pace responderit tibi, et aperuerit  tibi, et fiet ut omnis populus qui invenitur in ea, fiet tibi in tributum, et servient tibi, Deut. xx 10, 11: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam, Quomodo habitavit solitaria urbs 
magna populo, facta est  sicut vidua, magna inter gentes, quae dominata est in  provincias, facta est in tributariam, Thren. i 1; </p>
<p>ibi quod per `fieri in tributum' et per `tributariam' significetur servire, 
patet: apud Matthaeum, Jesus dixit, Quid tibi videtur Simon, reges terrae (c)a quibus accipiunt tributa aut censum, a filiis suis an ab alienis? dicit Ipsi Petrus, Ab alienis; ait ei Jesus, Ergo 
liberi sunt filii: verum ne simus iis offendiculo, {2}proficiscens ad mare mitte hamum, et ascendentem primo piscem tolle, aperias os ejus, invenies staterem,  accipiens da eum pro Me et te, xvii 
25-27; </p>
<p>hic quoque per `dare tributa {3}aut censum' intelliguntur qui serviunt, quare dicitur quod `alieni darent, et filii liberi essent', alienigenae enim erant servi, n. 1097; quod Petrus `e mari tolleret 
piscem, et in ore ejus inveniret staterem quem daret' repraesentabat quod infimum naturale quod servitium, hoc faceret; `pisces' enim id naturale significant. @1 quod etiam$ @2 profectus$ @3 et$ </p>
