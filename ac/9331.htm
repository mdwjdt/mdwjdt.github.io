<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9331节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9331.</strong>“我要打发黄蜂飞在你前面”表那些沉浸于邪恶所产生的虚假之人所感到的恐惧。这从“黄蜂”的含义清楚可知，“黄蜂”是指刺痛并致死，因此引起恐惧的虚假。惊恐论及那些沉浸于邪恶的人；恐惧论及那些沉浸于虚假的人；关于前者的惊恐，可参看前文（<a href="9327.htm">9327</a>节）。“黄蜂”之所以表示那些沉浸于虚假的人所感到的恐惧，是因为大黄蜂是带翅膀的生物，身上有刺，它们能用这些刺造成有毒伤口。事实上，生物无论大小，都表示诸如构成人类情感，也就是与意愿有关的那类事物；或者它们表示诸如构成人类思维，也就是与理解力有关的那类事物。因为人里面的一切事物，无一例外，都要么与他的意愿有关，要么与他的理解力有关。那些与这一个或那一个无关的事物在人里面不存在，因而不是此人的一部分。行走的生物和爬行的生物在这两种意义上都表示情感，因而表示良善或邪恶，因为这些属于情感；而飞行的生物，包括带翅膀的昆虫，在这两种意义上都表示诸如属于思维的那类事物，因而表示真理或虚假，因为这些属于思维。生物表示良善或邪恶（参看<a href="9280.htm">9280</a>节）；爬行生物表示外在感官层面上的良善或邪恶（<a href="746.htm">746</a>，<a href="909.htm">909</a>，<a href="994.htm">994</a>节）；飞行生物表示真理或虚假（<a href="40.htm">40</a>，<a href="745.htm">745</a>，<a href="776.htm">776</a>，<a href="778.htm">778</a>，<a href="866.htm">866</a>，<a href="988.htm">988</a>，<a href="3219.htm">3219</a>，<a href="5149.htm">5149</a>，<a href="7441.htm">7441</a>节）；因此，带翅膀的昆虫表示同样的事物，不过，这些事物存在于人类心智的最外层。<br />但现在所论述的虚假具有许多种类。有些虚假不会造成伤害，有些虚假会造成轻微伤害，有些虚假会造成严重伤害，还有些虚假则会致人于死地。从它们所源自的邪恶可以知道它们是哪一类的。事实上，一切有害或致命的虚假都来源于邪恶；因为邪恶所产生的虚假就是以一种外在形式显现的邪恶。此外，在来世，当这类虚假以一种可见的形式来呈现时，它们看似成群的肮脏昆虫和不洁的飞行生物；这种景象的可怕程度取决于它们所源自的邪恶类型。由此明显可知为何“黄蜂”表示那些沉浸于邪恶所产生的虚假之人所感到的恐惧。同样在申命记：<br />耶和华你神必打发黄蜂飞到他们中间，直到那剩下而从你面前躲藏的人灭亡。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.20.htm">7:20</a>）<br />圣言处处提到各种昆虫，凡提到它们的地方，它们都表示在人心智最外层，也就是人的外在感官层中的虚假或邪恶。这些邪恶和虚假来源于感官幻觉，来源于肉体的各种快感和欲望，它们通过诱惑和外表迷惑人，使理性同意并因此沉浸于邪恶所产生的虚假之中。这类虚假由埃及的“有害苍蝇”来表示（参看<a href="7441.htm">7441</a>）；同样由埃及的蝗虫来表示（<a href="7643.htm">7643</a>节）；埃及的“青蛙”则表示由虚假所产生的推理（<a href="7351.htm">7351</a>，<a href="7352.htm">7352</a>，<a href="7384.htm">7384</a>节）；埃及的“虱子”表示同一类的邪恶（<a href="7419.htm">7419</a>节）；“虫”表示吞灭和折磨人的虚假（<a href="8481.htm">8481</a>节）。<br />下列经文中的各种昆虫也表示这类邪恶和虚假。以赛亚书：<br />到那日，耶和华必吹哨召唤埃及河流尽头的苍蝇和亚述地的蜂子。它们必飞来，都停在荒凉的河流中、岩石缝里、一切灌木丛中。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛7.18.htm">7:18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛7.19.htm">19</a>）<br />此处论述的主题是主的降临和那时教会的状态。“埃及河流尽头的苍蝇”是指人类心智最外层，也就是人的外在感官层中的虚假（<a href="7441.htm">7441</a>节）；“亚述地的蜂子”表示败坏心智推理的虚假，因为“亚述”表示推理（<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>节）；“荒凉的河流”是指处处掌权的虚假；“岩石缝”是指处于模糊状态的信之真理，因为它们远离了天堂之光（参看<a href="8581.htm">8581</a>e节）；“灌木丛”是指类似但新发展的真理（<a href="2682.htm">2682</a>节）。<br />阿摩司书：<br />我以疫病、霉烂击打你们，你们许多的园子和葡萄园，你们的无花果树、橄榄树都被剪虫所吞吃。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩4.9.htm">4:9</a>）<br />约珥书：<br />剪虫剩下的，蝗虫来吞吃；蝗虫剩下的，蝻子来吞吃；蝻子剩下的，蚂蚱来吞吃。酒醉的人哪，醒来吧；一切好喝醉的人哪，要哀号，因为新酒从你们的口中断绝了。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥1.4.htm">1:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥1.5.htm">5</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />禾场必满了洁净的五谷；榨池必溢出新酒和油。我打发到你们中间的大军队，就是蝗虫、蝻子、蚂蚱、剪虫，那些年所吃的我要补还你们。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.24.htm">2:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.25.htm">25</a>）<br />此处提到的这些昆虫种类表示在教会成员的最外层，也就是外在感官层中的虚假和邪恶，这一点从所引用的这些经文的具体细节明显看出来，因为所论述的主题是教会的真理和良善的败坏。至于“蝗虫”和“蚂蚱”表示什么，可参看前文（<a href="7643.htm">7643</a>节）；被这些昆虫毁掉的“园子”、“葡萄园”、“无花果树”、“橄榄树”、“酒”和“新酒”一般表示教会的良善和真理，这在解释它们的时候常有说明。<br />诗篇：<br />他使青蛙爬上他们的地，爬进他们王的内室。他一说话，苍蝇就成群飞来，并有虱子进入他们四境。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗105.30.htm">105:30</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗105.31.htm">31</a>）<br />这论及埃及。至于埃及的“青蛙”表示什么，可参看前文（参看<a href="7351.htm">7351</a>，<a href="7352.htm">7352</a>，<a href="7384.htm">7384</a>节）；“虱子”表示什么（<a href="7419.htm">7419</a>节）。摩西五经：<br />你栽种修理葡萄园，却没有酒喝，也不得收集，因为虫子把它吃了。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申28.39.htm">28:39</a>）<br />“虫子”表示总体上所有这种虚假和邪恶。<br />以赛亚书：<br />不要怕人的辱骂，也不要因他们的毁谤惊惶。因为蛀虫必吃他们，像吃衣服一样；虫子必吃他们，像吃羊毛一样。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛51.7.htm">51:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛51.8.htm">8</a>）<br />“蛀虫”表示在人心智最外层中的真理；“虫子”表示那里的邪恶；因为“蛀虫所要吃的衣服”表示属于人心智感官层的更低级或更外在的真理（参看<a href="2576.htm">2576</a>，<a href="5248.htm">5248</a>，<a href="6377.htm">6377</a>，<a href="6918.htm">6918</a>，<a href="9158.htm">9158</a>，<a href="9212.htm">9212</a>节）；“虫子所要吃的羊毛”表示属于人心智感官层的更低级或更外在的良善，这从许多经文，以及“羊”的含义明显看出来：羊毛所出自的“羊”是指仁之 良善（参看<a href="4169.htm">4169</a>节）。至于被称为感官层的属世人的最外层到底是什么，是何性质，可参看前文（<a href="4009.htm">4009</a>，<a href="5077.htm">5077</a>，<a href="5081.htm">5081</a>，<a href="5089.htm">5089</a>，<a href="5094.htm">5094</a>，<a href="5125.htm">5125</a>，<a href="5128.htm">5128</a>，<a href="5580.htm">5580</a>，<a href="5767.htm">5767</a>，<a href="5774.htm">5774</a>，<a href="6183.htm">6183</a>，<a href="6201.htm">6201</a>，<a href="6310.htm">6310</a>-<a href="6318.htm">6318</a>，<a href="6564.htm">6564</a>，<a href="6598.htm">6598</a>，<a href="6612.htm">6612</a>，<a href="6614.htm">6614</a>，<a href="6622.htm">6622</a>，<a href="6624.htm">6624</a>，<a href="6844.htm">6844</a>，<a href="6845.htm">6845</a>，<a href="6948.htm">6948</a>，<a href="6949.htm">6949</a>，<a href="7442.htm">7442</a>，<a href="7645.htm">7645</a>，<a href="7693.htm">7693</a>，<a href="9212.htm">9212</a>，<a href="9216.htm">9216</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9331</b></p><p><b>9331.</b>
And I will send the hornet before thee. That this signifies the dread felt by those who are in the falsities of evil, is evident from the signification of "hornets," as being stinging and deadly falsities, 
and hence such as excite dread. "Terror" is predicated of those who are in evils; and "dread" of those who are in falsities (as regards the terror of the former, see above, n. 9327). That "hornets" 
signify the dread felt by those who are in falsities, is because they are winged, and furnished with stings, with which they inflict poisoned wounds. For both the larger and the smaller animals signify 
such things as are of the affections, that is, which bear relation to the will; or else they signify such things as are of the thoughts, that is, which bear relation to the understanding. For all 
things whatsoever in man bear relation either to his will or to his understanding; and those things which bear no relation either to the one or to the other are not in the man, thus are not of the 
man. Those animals which walk, and also those which creep, signify the affections in both senses; thus goods or evils, for these are of the affections. But those animals which fly, and also winged insects, 
signify such things as are of the thoughts in both senses; thus truths or falsities, for these are of the thoughts. That "animals" signify goods, or evils, see n. 9280; that "creeping things" signify 
the same in the external sensuous, n. 746, 909, 994; that "flying things" signify truths or falsities, n. 40, 745, 776, 778, 866, 988, 3219, 5149, 7441; consequently winged insects signify the like 
things, but in man's extremes.  [2] But the falsities now treated of are of many kinds; there are falsities which do not injure, there are falsities which injure slightly, there are those which injure 
grievously, and there are also those which kill. Their kind is known from the evils they spring from; for every falsity that injures, or kills, springs from evil; because falsity from evil is evil 
appearing in a form. Moreover, in the other life, when such falsities are represented in a visible form, they appear as a swarm of insects and of unclean flying things, the appearance of which is terrible, 
according to the kind of evil from which they spring. From all this it is evident why "hornets" signify the dread felt by those who are in the falsities of evil. In like manner in Deuteronomy: </p>
<p> 
    Jehovah thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and those hidden before thee, perish (Deut. 7:20). [3] In the Word throughout mention is made of insects of various 
kinds, and they everywhere signify falsities or evils in the extremes (that is, in man's external sensuous), which are evils and falsities arising from the fallacies of the senses, and from various pleasures 
and appetites in the body, which seduce by their allurements and their appearances, and cause the rational to assent, and thus to be immersed in falsities from evil. (That falsities of this kind 
are signified by the "noisome flies" of Egypt, see n. 7441; likewise by the "locusts" there, n. 7643; and that by the "frogs" of Egypt are signified reasonings from falsities, n. 7351, 7352, 7384; 
by the "lice" there, evils of the same kind, n. 7419; and that by "worms" are signified falsities which consume and torment, n. 8481). [4] Such evils and falsities are also signified by insects of various 
kinds in the following passages. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     It shall come to pass in that day that Jehovah shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that 
is in the land of Assyria. And they shall all come and rest in the river of desolations and in the clefts of the rocks, and in all shrubs (Isa. 7:18, 19); </p>
<p>the subject here treated of is the coming of 
the Lord, and the state of the church at that time. "The fly in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt" denotes falsity in the extremes, that is, in man's external sensuous (n. 7441); "the bee in 
the land of Assyria" denotes the falsity which perverts the reasonings of the mind, for "Assyria" denotes reasoning (n. 1186); "the river of desolations" denotes falsity reigning everywhere; "the clefts 
of the rock" denote the truths of faith in obscurity, because removed from the light of heaven (see n. 8581); the "shrubs" denote nascent truths of a similar kind (n. 2682). [5] Again: </p>
<p>     I have 
smitten you with blasting and mildew; your many gardens, and your vineyards, and your fig-trees, and your olive-trees, hath the caterpillar devoured (Amos 4:9).      That which the caterpillar hath 
left shall the locust eat; and that which the locust hath left shall the cankerworm eat; and that which the cankerworm hath left shall the bruchus eat. Awake, ye drunkards; and howl, all ye drinkers 
of wine, because of the must which is cut off from your mouth (Joel 1:4-5).      The floors are full of clean grain, the presses overflow with must and oil. And I will compensate to you the years that 
the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the bruchus, and the caterpillar, My great army which I have sent among you (Joel 2:24, 25). That falsities and evils in the extremes-that is, in the external 
sensuous of the man of the church-are signified by the kinds of insects here mentioned, is evident from these various expressions, for the subject treated of is the perversion of the truth and good 
of the church. (What is signified by the "locust" and the "bruchus," see n. 7643; and that by "gardens," "vineyards," "fig-trees," "olive-trees," "wine," and "must," which are destroyed by such insects, 
are signified the goods and truths of the church in general, has often been shown in these explications.) [6] In David: </p>
<p>     He made frogs to creep forth in their land, in the chambers of their 
kings. He said that there should come filthy swarms, lice in all their border (Ps. 105:30, 31); </p>
<p>speaking of Egypt (what is meant by the "frogs" there, see n. 7351, 7352, 7384; and what by the "lice," 
n. 7419). In Moses: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress them, but thou shalt not drink the wine, nor gather, for the worm shall eat it (Deut. 28:39); </p>
<p>"the worm" denotes all such falsity and 
evil in general. [7] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye dismayed at their revilings; for the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the blatta shall eat them like 
wool (Isa. 51:7, 8); </p>
<p>"the moth" denotes the falsities in man's extremes; and "the blatta," the evils therein; for "the garment which the moth shall eat" signifies the lower or more external truths which 
belong to the sensuous of man (see n. 2576, 5248, 6377, 6918, 9158, 9212), and "the wool which the blatta shall eat" signifies the lower or more external goods which belong to the sensuous of man, 
as is evident from many passages, and also from the signification of "a sheep," from which wool comes, as being the good of charity (see n. 4169). (What, and of what quality, are the extremes of the 
natural man, which are called his sensuous things, see n. 4009, 5077, 5081, 5089, 5094, 5125, 5128, 5580, 5767, 5774, 6183, 6201, 6310-6318, 6564, 6598, 6612, 6614, 6622, 6624, 6844, 6845, 6948, 6949, 
7442, 7645, 7693, 9212, 9216.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9331</b></p><p><b>9331.</b>
'And I will send the hornet before you' means the dread felt by those who are steeped in falsities arising from evil. This is clear from the meaning of 'hornets' as falsities that are stinging and lethal 
and therefore cause feelings of dread. Terror is used in reference to those immersed in evils, and dread to those steeped in falsities; regarding the terror felt by the former, see above in <a href="9327.htm">9327</a>. 
The reason why the dread felt by those steeped in falsities is meant by 'hornets' is that these are winged creatures equipped with stings with which they can administer venomous pricks. For living creatures 
both great and small mean such things as compose human affections, that is, such as are connected with the will, or else they mean such things as compose human thoughts, that is, such as are connected 
with the understanding. For everything without exception in the human being has connection either with his will or with his understanding. Things that have no connection with one or the other 
do not exist in the human being, and so are not part of the human being. Creatures that walk and also ones that creep mean affections in both senses, and so mean forms of good or else evils since these 
belong to the affections, whereas flying creatures, including insects with wings, mean such things as belong to thought in both senses, and so mean truths or else falsities since these belong to thoughts. 
 </p>
<p>Living creatures mean forms of good or else evils, see <a href="9280.htm">9280</a>. Ones that creep mean forms of good or else evils on the external level of the senses, <a href="746.htm">746</a>, <a href="909.htm">909</a>, <a href="994.htm">994</a>. Flying creatures mean truths 
or falsities, <a href="40.htm">40</a>, <a href="745.htm">745</a>, <a href="776.htm">776</a>, <a href="778.htm">778</a>, <a href="866.htm">866</a>, <a href="911.htm">911</a>, <a href="988.htm">988</a>, <a href="3219.htm">3219</a>, <a href="5149.htm">5149</a>, <a href="7441.htm">7441</a>. Consequently insects with wings mean the same things, but as they exist on the outermost levels of the human mind.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But falsities, 
which are the subject now, are of many kinds. There are falsities which do no harm, there are falsities which do slight harm and those which do serious harm, and there are also those which are 
lethal. What kind they are is recognized from the evils they arise from. Every falsity that is harmful or that is lethal owes its existence to evil; for falsity arising from evil is evil revealing itself 
in an outward form. In the next life also, when such falsities are represented visually, they are seen as swarms of filthy insects and flying creatures, a terrifying sight that is determined by the 
type of evil from which the falsities derive. From all this it is evident why it is that the dread felt by those steeped in falsities arising from evil is meant by 'hornets'. Similarly in Deuteronomy, 
 </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah your God will send the hornet among them, until those who are left and hide themselves from you have perished. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%207:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 7:20</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Throughout the Word various types of insects are mentioned, 
and wherever they are mentioned they mean falsities or evils in the outermost levels of the human mind, or the external level of the senses. These evils and falsities have their origin in the illusions 
of the senses and in various bodily pleasures and appetites, which mislead by means of their allurements and by outward appearances, and cause reason to assent to and so become immersed in falsities 
arising from evil. This type of falsities is meant by 'the noxious flying insects' of Egypt, see <a href="7441.htm">7441</a>, and likewise by 'the locusts' there, <a href="7643.htm">7643</a>. By 'the frogs' of Egypt reasonings arising from 
falsities are meant, <a href="7351.htm">7351</a>, <a href="7352.htm">7352</a>, <a href="7384.htm">7384</a>; by 'the lice' there evils of the same kind are meant, <a href="7419.htm">7419</a>; and by 'worms' falsities that devour and torment, <a href="8481.htm">8481</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Such evils and falsities are also meant 
by the various types of insects referred to in the following places: In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
It will happen on that day, that Jehovah will whistle for the fly that is in the farthest part of the rivers of 
Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Asshur. They will come and all of them will rest in the river of desolations, and in the clefts of the rocks, and in all bushes. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%207:18,%2019&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 7:18, 19</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This refers 
to the Lord's Coming, and to the state of the Church then. 'The fly in the farthest part of the rivers of Egypt' is falsity on the outermost levels of the human mind, that is, on the external level 
of the senses, <a href="7441.htm">7441</a>. 'The bee in the land of Asshur' is falsity perverting reasonings in the mind; for 'Asshur' means reasoning, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>. 'The river of desolations' is falsity reigning everywhere; 'the 
clefts of the rocks' are the truths of faith lying in obscurity, because they have been removed from the light of heaven, <a href="8581.htm">8581</a> (end); and 'bushes' are similar but newly developing truths, <a href="2682.htm">2682</a>.  </p>
<p></p>

In Amos,  </p>
<blockquote>
I struck you with blight and mildew; your very many gardens, and your vineyards, and your fig trees, and your olive trees the caterpillar (eruca) devoured. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%204:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 4:9</a>.

<p>Here falsities and evils on the outermost levels or the external level of the senses of a member of the Church are meant by these types of insects, as is evident from 
the specific details in these quotations; for they refer to the perversion of the Church's truth and good. What 'the locust' and what 'the bruchus' mean may be seen in <a href="7643.htm">7643</a>; and the fact that the Church's 
forms of good and its truths in general are meant by 'gardens', 'vineyards', 'fig trees', 'olive trees', 'wine', and 'new wine', which are destroyed by such creatures, has been shown often in explanations.

 In David,  </p>
<blockquote>
He caused frogs to crawl forth onto their land, into the chambers of their kings. He spoke, that a swarm might come, lice in all their borders. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20105:30,%2031&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 105:30, 31</a>.

<p>This 
refers to Egypt. What is meant by 'frogs' there, see <a href="7351.htm">7351</a>, <a href="7352.htm">7352</a>, <a href="7384.htm">7384</a>; and what by 'lice', <a href="7419.htm">7419</a>. In Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
You will plant and dress vineyards, but not drink wine nor gather [the fruit]; for the 
worm will eat it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2028:39&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 28:39</a>.

<p>'The worm' stands for all such falsity and evil in general.  </p>

<p><b>[7]</b>
 In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Do not fear the reproach of man (homo), and do not be dismayed by their slanders. 
For the moth will devour them as a garment, and the grub will devour them as wool. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2051:7,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 51:7, 8</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The moth' stands for falsities on the outermost levels of the human mind, and 'the grub' for evils 
there. For 'a garment' which the moth will devour means the lower or more external truths that belong to the sensory level of the human mind, <a href="2576.htm">2576</a>, <a href="5248.htm">5248</a>, <a href="6377.htm">6377</a>, <a href="6918.htm">6918</a>, <a href="9158.htm">9158</a>, <a href="9212.htm">9212</a>; and 'wool' which the 
grub will devour means the lower or more external forms of good that belong to the sensory level of the human mind, as is evident from many places in the Word, and also from the meaning of 'a sheep', 
from which wool is obtained, as the good of charity, <a href="4169.htm">4169</a>.

`Et mittam crabronem ante te': quod significet formidinem illorum qui in falsis mali, constat ex significatione `crabronum' quod sint falsa pungentia et (x)necantia, et inde formidinem incutientia; 
(m)terror praedicatur de illis qui in malis, et formido de illis qui in falsis; de terrore illorum, videatur (o)supra n. 9327;(n) quod `crabrones' formidinem illorum qui in falsis {1} significent, est 
quia alati sunt et praediti aculeis {2} quibus punctiones (x)venenatas inferunt; (s)animalia enim tam majora quam minora significant talia quae sunt affectionum, `seu' quae se referunt ad voluntatem, 
aut (c)significant talia quae sunt cogitationum, (o)seu quae se referunt ad intellectum; nam omnia quaecumque in homine sunt, se referunt {3} vel ad ejus voluntatem vel ad ejus intellectum; quae non 
ad alterutrum se referunt {4} (d)non sunt in homine, ita non sunt hominis; animalia gradientia et quoque reptilia significant affectiones in utroque sensu, ita bona vel mala, nam haec sunt affectionum, 
at vero animalia volantia et quoque insecta alata significant talia quae sunt cogitationum in utroque sensu, ita vera vel falsa, nam haec sunt cogitationum; quod animalia significent bona vel mala, 
videatur n. 9280, quod reptilia talia in sensuali externo, n. 746, 909, 994,	{5} quo volatilia (o)significent vera vel falsa, n. 40, 745, 776, 778, 866, (m)(t)911, 988, 3219, 5149, 7441; inde insecta 
alata significant similia, sed in extremis hominis. 	[2] Ast falsa, de quibus nunc {6},(n)(s) sunt {7} plurium generum: sunt falsa quae non laedunt, sunt falsa quae leviter et {8} quae graviter laedunt, 
et quoque sunt quae necant; cognoscuntur cujus generis sunt ex malis ex quibus sunt; omne enim falsum quod laedit et quod necat trahit suum existere ex malo, nam falsum ex malo est malum apparens 
in forma; in altera vita etiam talia falsa cum repraesentantur in forma visibili, sistuntur sicut colluvies insectorum et volatilium immundorum, et (o)terribilium aspectu secundum mali ex quo sunt {9}, 
speciem.  Ex his patet unde est quod `crabrones' significent formidinem illorum qui in falsis mali sunt; similiter in (x)Deuteronomio, 	Crabronem mittet Jehovah Deus tuus in illos, usque dum perierint 
residui et absconditi coram te, vii 20. 	[3] In Verbo memorantur passim insecta varii generis, et ubivis significant falsa aut mala in extremis, seu in sensuali externo hominis quae sunt mala et 
falsa oriunda ex fallaciis sensuum ac ex voluptatibus et appetitibus variis in corpore, quae per lenocinia sua et per apparentias seducunt, ac faciunt ut rationale assentiat, et sic immergatur falsis 
ex malo; quod falsa illius generis significentur per `volatilia noxia' Aegypti, videatur n. 7441, pariter per `locustas' ibi {10} n. 7643, quod per `ranas' Aegypti significentur ratiocinia ex falsis n. 
7351, 7352, 7384, per `pediculos' ibi mala ejusdem generis, n. 7419 et quod per `vermes' falsa quae consumunt et cruciant, n. 8481. 	[4] Talia quoque mala et falsa significantur {11} per insectorum 
variorum genera in sequentibus his locis: apud Esaiam, 	Fiet in die illo sibilabit Jehovah muscae quae in extremitate fluviorum Aegypti, et api quae in terra Aschuris; quae venient e quiescent omnes 
in fluvio desolationum, et in fissuris petrarum, et in omnibus virgultis, vii 18, 19; </p>
<p>agitur ibi de Adventu Domini, et de statu Ecclesiae tunc; `musca in extremitate fluviorum Aegypti' est falsum in 
extremis, hoc est in sensuali externo hominis, n. 7441, `apis in terra Aschuris' est falsum pervertens ratiocinia mentis, `Aschur' enim est ratiocinatio, n. 1186 `fluvius desolationum' est falsitas ubivis 
regnans, `fissurae petrarum' sunt vera fidei in obscuro, quia {12} remota a luce caeli, n. 8581 fin., `virgulta' sunt vera nascentia {13} similia, n. 2682: [5] apud Amos, 	(x)Percussi vos uredine 
et rubigine; plurimos hortes vestros et vineas vestras, et ficus vestras, et oleas vestras, comedit eruca iv 9: </p>
<p>apud Joelem, 	Residuum erucae comedet locusta, et residuum locustae comedet melolontha, 
et residuum melolonthae comedet bruchus; expergiscimini, ebrii, et ejulate, omnes potantes vinum, propter mustum quod excisum est ex ore vestro, i 4, 5: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Plenae sunt areae frumento 
puro, exundant torcularia mustum et oleum; et compensabo vobis annos quos consumpsit locusta, (x)melolontha, et bruchus, et eruca, exercitus Meus magnus quem misi inter vos, ii 24, 25; </p>
<p>quod hic falsa 
et mala in extremis seu sensuali externo hominis Ecclesiae per insectorum illorum genera significentur, patet ex singulis ibi, nam agitur de perversione veri et boni Ecclesiae; quid `locusta' et quid 
`bruchus,' videatur n. 7643; quod per `hortos, vineas, ficus, oleas, vinum, et mustum,' quae a talibus perdentur, significentur bona et vera Ecclesiae in communi {14}, saepius in explicationibus ostensum 
est: [6] apud Davidem, 	Prorepere fecit in terram eorum ranas, in conclavia {15} regum eorum; dixit ut veniret colluvies, pediculi in omni termino eorum, Ps. cv (x)30, 31; </p>
<p>ibi de Aegypto; quid 
`ranae' ibi, videatur n. 7351, 7352, 7384, et quid `pediculi,' n. 7419: apud Moschen, 	Vineas plantabis et coles, sed vinum non bibes, neque congregabis, quia comedet illud vermis, Deut. (x)xxviii 39; </p>
<p>`vermis' 
pro omni tali falso et malo in genere {16}: [7] apud Esaiam, 	Ne timete opprobrium hominis, et a calumniis eorum ne consternemini, quia sicut vestem comedet eos tinea, et sicut lanam comedet 
eos blatta, li [7,] 8; </p>
<p>`tinea' pro falsis in extremis hominis, et `blatta' pro malis ibi, nam `vestis quam comedet tinea' significat vera inferiora seu exteriora quae sunt sensualis hominis, n. 
2576, 5248, 6377, 6918, 9158, 9212, et `lana quam comedet {17} blatta' significat bona inferiora seu exteriora quae sunt sensualis hominis, quod patet a pluribus locis {18}, tum a significatione `ovis 
e qua lana' quod sit bonum charitatis, n. 4169.  (m)Quaenam et qualia sunt extrema naturalis hominis, quae sensualia vocantur, videatur n. 4009, 5077, 5081, 5084, 5089, 5094, 5125, 5128, 5580, 5767, 
5774, 6183, 6201, (x)6310-6318, (x)6564, 6598, 6612, 6614, 6622, 6624, 6844, 6845, 6948, 6949, 7442, 7645, 7693, 9212, 9216.(n) @1 id$ @2 aculeis praediti sunt$ @3 After intellectum$ @4 quae ad unum
