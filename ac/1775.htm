<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1775节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1775.</strong>我曾与一些灵人谈论过圣言，我说，按照主的天命，赐下一些启示是很有必要的。因为启示或圣言是接受属灵和属天之物的一般容器，并且在接受的过程中会将天与地联结起来。事实上，没有启示，这二者就会彼此分离，人类必要灭亡。我还提到一个事实，即天堂真理存在于某处是有必要的，人可由此接受教导，因为他是为天堂之物而生的，并且在肉身生活结束后，会加入到那些在天堂的人之列。而信之真理则是他将永远生活于其中的国度的秩序法则。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1775.</strong> With one group of spirits I discussed the Word and the need for some kind of revelation to have been given, in the Lord's divine providence. After all, revelation — the Word — is a broad container, holding within it both spiritual and heavenly elements and consequently uniting heaven and earth. Without it, heaven and earth would have lacked connection and the human race would have perished.<br />In addition, it was necessary that heavenly truth be available somewhere for people to learn, because we were born for heavenly purposes and should come among heavenly beings when bodily life ends. Religious truth forms the laws of order in the realm where we will be spending eternity. </p>

I have conversed with certain spirits concerning the Word, saying that it has been necessary that of the Lord's Divine Providence some revelation should come into existence, for a revelation or Word 
is the general recipient vessel of spiritual and celestial things, thus conjoining heaven and earth; and that without it they would have been disjoined, and the human race would have perished. And besides 
it is necessary that there should be heavenly truths somewhere, by which man may be instructed, because he was born for heavenly things, and, after the life of the body, ought to come among those 
who are heavenly; for the truths of faith are the laws of order in the kingdom in which he is to live forever. </p>

I have talked to certain spirits about the Word - that in the Lord's Divine Providence, it has been necessary for some revelation to be given; for such revelation, or the Word, is a general vessel that 
receives spiritual and celestial things, and in so doing joins heaven and earth together. Indeed without that revelation the two would have been set apart from each other, and the human race would 
have perished. I have referred as well to the fact that it was necessary for heavenly truths to exist somewhere from which man might receive instruction seeing that man was born for heavenly things and 
after his life in the body ought to come among those in heaven. For the truths of faith are the laws of order within the kingdom in which he is to live for ever. </p>

</p><b>1775.</b>
Locutus sum cum quibusdam spiritibus de Verbo, quod necessum fuerit ut aliqua revelatio, ex Divina Domini Providentia, exstiterit, nam revelatio seu Verbum est commune vas recipiens spiritualium et 
caelestium, ita conjungens caelum et terram, alioquin disjuncta fuissent, et periisset humanum genus: praeter quod alicubi caelestes veritates essent quibus instrueretur homo, quia ad caelestia natus, 
et post vitam corporis inter caelestes venire debet; sunt enim veritates fidei leges ordinis in regno in quo victurus in aeternum. </p>
