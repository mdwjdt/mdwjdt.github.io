<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10163节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10163</strong>.一些灵人看上去和他们在自己的星球上时一模一样。他们的脸和我们地球人的脸没什么不同，只是他们的眼睛和鼻子都很小。在我看来，这使得他们相当丑陋；可他们说，在他们看来，小眼睛和小鼻子是美的。一个女人出现了，她穿了一件长袍，上面带有各种颜色的玫瑰花。我问在这个星球，他们怎么制作衣服。他们回答说，他们从植物中搜集那种能纺成线的材料，然后把线分成两层和三层，用一种粘液湿润它们，从而将其牢牢粘在一起。随后，他们用植物的汁液给织物上色。</p>

Spirits were seen like what they had been when they were men on their earth. Their faces are not unlike the faces of the men of our earth, except that their eyes are small, and also their noses. As this 
appeared to me somewhat of a deformity, they said that to them small eyes and noses are beautiful. A woman was seen clad in a mantle on which were roses of various colors. When I asked how they procure 
their garments on that earth, they replied that they gather from plants such things as they can entwine into threads, and that after laying the threads straight they place them together in double 
and triple rows, and moisten them with a glutinous fluid, and in this way they induce a consistency, and afterward color this fabric with the juices of plants. </p>

Some spirits appeared who looked just the same as they had done when they were people on their planet. Their faces were not unlike those of people belonging to our planet, except that their eyes and 
also their nose were small. Since this seemed to me to make them rather ugly they said that to them small eyes and a small nose are beautiful. A woman appeared, clothed with a gown that had different 
coloured roses on it. I asked how they make their garments on that planet. They replied that they gather from plants certain elements which they spin into threads, and that after this they place the threads 
in two or three layers, wet them with a sticky fluid, and in this way make them cling firmly to one another. Subsequently they colour the fabric with juices from plants.  </p>

</p><b>10163.</b>
Visi sunt spiritus qui similes sibi cum homines in sua tellure fuerunt; erant facie non absimili faciei hominum nostrae telluris, praeter quod oculi eorum parvi essent, et quoque nasus parvus; hoc quia 
apparebat mihi ut aliquantum deforme, dicebant quod parvi oculi et parvus nasus illis pulchritudo sit.  Femina visa est, induta toga in qua rosae varii coloris; quaerebam unde sibi in tellure illa 
parant vestes; respondebant quod legant ex herbis talia quae contexunt in fila, et quod fila dein stratim componant duplici ac triplici ordine, ac umectent aqua glutinosa, et sic consistentiam inducant; 
colorando illam telam postea ex sucis herbaceis. </p>
