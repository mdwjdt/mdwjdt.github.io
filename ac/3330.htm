<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3330.</strong> “把长子的名分卖给雅各”表与此同时，优先权也让出去了，也就是让给了雅各所代表的真理教义。这从“长子的名分”的含义清楚可知，“长子的名分”是指优先权（参看<a href="3325.htm">3325</a>）；与此同时，这优先权也让出去了，这一点从前面的阐述和说明（<a href="3324.htm">3324</a>，<a href="3325.htm">3325</a>节）明显看出来。对属灵之人来说，一开始，真理拥有统治权，这主要是因为他的初始状态里有对自我和尘世之爱的快乐。他以为这些快乐就是良善，而这些快乐就附着于他的真理，并构成他里面对真理的情感的较大部分。事实上，那时他以为真理能帮他获得重要地位，或物质利益，或世上的名声，甚至来世的功德。所有这些都激发他里面对真理的情感，还点燃它。然而，它们都不是良善，而是邪恶。<br />尽管如此，主仍容许这类事在初期影响他，要不然，他无法重生。聪明和智慧的到来是需要时间的；与此同时，这人通过这些真理被引入良善，即仁爱中。一旦有了仁爱，他第一次意识到何为良善，并通过良善行事，同时通过这关于真理的良善进行判断、得出结论。与这良善不一致的事物，他都视为虚假，并拒绝之。他以这种方式掌管真理，就像主人掌管他的仆人。</p>

And he sold his birthright unto Jacob. That this signifies that in the meantime priority was granted, namely, to the doctrine of truth which is "Jacob," is evident from the signification of "birthright," 
as being priority (see n. 3325); and that this was granted in the meantime, is manifest from what was said and shown above (n. 3324, 3325). That in the spiritual man in the beginning truth has the 
dominion, is chiefly because in his first state there are delights of the love of self and of the world which he believes to be good, and which apply themselves to his truths, and for the most part 
produce the affection of truth in him; for he then thinks that truths may be serviceable to him either for honor, or for gain, or for reputation in the world, or even for merit in the other life. All 
these things excite this affection of truth in him, and also enkindle it; and yet they are not good, but evil. Nevertheless the Lord permits that such things should influence him in that first time, because 
otherwise he could not be regenerated. Intelligence and wisdom come in time; in the meanwhile through these truths the man is introduced into good, that is, into charity; and when he is in this, 
then for the first time he perceives what is good, and acts from good, and then judges and draws conclusions from this good concerning truths; and those which do not accord with this good he calls false, 
and rejects. Thus he rules over truths as a master over his servants. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3330</b></p><p><b>3330.</b>
'And he sold his birthright to Jacob' means that in the meantime priority was conceded - to the doctrine of truth represented by Jacob. This is clear from the meaning of 'the birthright' as that which 
has priority of place, dealt with above in <a href="3325.htm">3325</a>, which in the meantime was conceded, as is evident from what has been stated and shown above in <a href="3324.htm">3324</a>, <a href="3325.htm">3325</a>. The chief reason why with the spiritual man 
truth has dominion first is that in his initial state delights that belong to self-love and love of the world are present. These he believes to be the goods which attach themselves to his truths and 
constitute the greater part of the affection for truth with him. Indeed at this time he supposes that truths are able to assist him in the acquisition of important positions, or of material gain, or 
of reputation in the world, or also of merit in the next life. All these arouse that affection for truth with him and also set it ablaze. These are not however good but bad. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Nevertheless the Lord 
does allow such things in that initial period to carry him along because he could not otherwise be regenerated. The arrival at intelligence and wisdom takes time In the meantime he is led on by means 
of those truths to good, that is, to charity. And once he has charity he perceives for the first time what good is and acts from good, and at the same time good is the source of his decisions and conclusions 
concerning truths. And things that do not accord with that good he calls falsities and rejects. In this way he has dominion over truths like a master over his servants </p>

`Et vendidit primogenituram suam Jacobo': quod significet quod prioritas interea concessa, nempe doctrinae veri quae est `Jacobus,' constat a significatione `primogeniturae' quod sit prioritas, de qua 
supra n. 3325, quae quod interea concessa sit, patet ab illis quae supra n. 3324, 3325 dicta et ostensa sunt. Quod apud spiritualem hominem principio dominetur verum, est principaliter causa quia in 
primo ejus statu sunt jucunda amoris sui et mundi, quae credit bona quae se applicant veris ejus, et faciunt quoad plurimam partem affectionem veri apud eum; cogitat enim tunc quod vera illi inservire 
possunt vel ad honores, vel ad lucrum, vel ad famam in mundo, vel quoque ad meritum in altera vita; haec omnia excitant affectionem illam veri apud eam, et quoque accendunt, quae tamen sunt non bona 
sed mala; [2] at usque permittit Dominus ut talia primo illo tempore ferant illum, quia alioquin {1}non regenerari poterit; intelligentia et sapientia venit tempore; interea per illa introducitur in 
bonum, hoc est, in charitatem, in qua cum est, tunc primum percipit quid bonum, et ex bono agit, et tunc de veris judicat et concludit ex illo bono, et quae non cum illo bono concordant, vocat falsa 
et rejicit; dominans ita super vera, ut herus super suos famulos. @1 regenerari non potest$  </p>
