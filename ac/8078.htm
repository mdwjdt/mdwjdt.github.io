<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8078节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8078.</strong>“凡驴中打开子宫的，你要用羊群中的一只赎回”表归于主的，必不是纯属世之信，而是存在于它里面的纯真之真理。这从“打开”、“驴”、“赎回”和“羊群中的一只”的含义清楚可知。“打开”是指从一个重生之人那里首先生出的，也就是头生的，因而是指信；前面早已说明，“头生的”表示信。“驴”是指属世层，“驴”表示记忆知识（<a href="5492.htm">5492</a>，<a href="5741.htm">5741</a>节），也表示服务或顺服（<a href="5958.htm">5958</a>，<a href="6389.htm">6389</a>节），因而还表示属世层，因为记忆知识属于属世层，相对于属灵层，属世层是服务或顺服的；因此“驴中打开子宫的”在此表示纯粹属世之信，如下文所述。“赎回”是指给予某种其它事物来代替；“赎回”具有这种含义，这一点从这些话，即“你不要将驴中打开子宫的归给耶和华，而要用羊群中的一只赎回”所包含的全部信息清楚看出来。<br />刚才（<a href="8074.htm">8074</a>节）已说明，“归给耶和华”表示归于主，和“分别为圣”并“献为祭”一样；因此，“不要归给耶和华，而要赎回”表示不归于，而是给予某种其它事物来代替。“羊群中的一只”是指纯真之良善。“羊群中的一只”之所以表示纯真之良善，是因为“羊群中的一只”表示一只羔羊或一只小山羊，这些表示纯真（<a href="3519.htm">3519</a>，<a href="3994.htm">3994</a>，<a href="7840.htm">7840</a>节），在此表示纯真之真理，因经上没有说“一只羔羊”或“一只小山羊”，而是说“羊群中的一只”。由此明显可知，“凡驴中打开子宫的，你要用羊群中的一只赎回”表示归于主的，必不是纯属世之信，而是存在于它里面的纯真之真理。<br />纯属世之信是通过一种外在途径，而非一种内在途径而逐渐灌输的信。其中一种就是感官之信，这信完全依赖感官，就在于人信某事是这样的，是因为眼睛看见了，手摸到了。主对多马说话时就提到了这种信：<br />多马，你因看见了我才信，那没有看见就信的有福了！（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约20.29.htm">20:29</a>）<br />另一种是神迹之信，这信在于人唯独由于神迹而信某事是这样的，关于这种信，可参看前文（<a href="7290.htm">7290</a>节）。还有一种是权威之信，这信在于人信某事是这样的，是因为他所信靠的另一人说过这事。<br />但属灵之信是通过一种内在途径，同时通过一种外在途径而逐渐被灌输的。经由内在途径的灌输产生信仰，同时经由外在途径灌输的东西则用来证实它。信的属灵要素是仁之情感，由此是为了良善的功用，或真正的服务而对真理的一种情感。这些使得信成为属灵的。当人阅读圣言，同时从主接受启示时，信便经由内在途径逐渐被灌输。这种启示照着情感的品质，也就是照着在认识真理中所着眼的目的而被赐予他。<br />由此可见何为纯属世之信，这信因不是属灵的，故不可能被归于主，也就是说，不可能有来自主的承认或信仰。因为主经由对真理和良善的情感而流入；信是一种内在情感（参看<a href="8034.htm">8034</a>节）。能存在于这纯属世之信中，并能被主认可的纯真之真理就是一个人出于纯真信以为真的任何事物。由此可见当如何理解归于主的，必不是纯属世之信，而是存在于它里面的纯真之真理。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8078</b></p><p><b>8078.</b>
And all that openeth of an ass thou shalt redeem with one of the flock. That this signifies that faith merely natural must not be ascribed to the Lord, but the truth of innocence which is therein, is 
evident from the signification of "that openeth," as being that which is born first from a regenerate one, that is, the firstborn, thus faith (that faith is the firstborn has been shown heretofore); 
and from the signification of "an ass," as being the natural, for by "an ass" is signified memory-knowledge (n. 5492, 5741), also service (n. 5958, 6389), thus also the natural, for memory-knowledges 
belong to the natural, and relatively to the spiritual the natural is service, consequently now by "that which openeth of an ass" is signified faith merely natural (of which presently); and from the signification 
of "redeeming" as being to give something else in its place. That "redeeming" has this signification is clear from the full meaning of the words, namely, of these, "that which openeth of 
an ass thou shalt not cause to pass over to Jehovah, but shalt redeem with one of the flock."  [2] That "to cause to pass over to Jehovah" denotes to ascribe to the Lord, in like manner as "to sanctify," 
and "to sacrifice," has been shown just above (n. 8074); thus "not to cause to pass over, but to redeem" denotes not to ascribe, but to give something else in its place. And from the signification 
of "one of the flock," as being the truth of innocence. That "one of the flock" denotes the truth of innocence, is because by "one of the flock" is meant a lamb or a kid, and by these is signified innocence 
(n. 3519, 3994, 7840), here, the truth of innocence, because it is not said "a lamb," or "a kid," but "one of the flock." From all this it is evident that by "all that openeth of an ass thou 
shalt redeem with one of the flock" is signified that faith merely natural must not be ascribed to the Lord, but the truth of innocence which is therein.  [3] Faith merely natural is faith which is insinuated 
by an external and not by an internal way, such as sensuous faith, which consists in believing a thing to be so because the eye has seen, and the hand has touched. This is the faith concerning 
which the Lord said to Thomas, "Because thou hast seen, Thomas, thou hast believed; blessed are they who do not see, and believe" (John 20:29); and also is like the faith of miracles, which consists 
in believing a thing to be so merely from the miracles, concerning which faith see above (n. 7290); as also the faith of authority, which consists in believing a thing to be so because another, in whom 
one has faith, has said it.  [4] But spiritual faith is that which is insinuated by an internal and at the same time by an external way; the insinuation by the internal way causes it to be believed, 
and then that which is insinuated by the external way causes it to be confirmed. The spiritual of faith is the affection of charity, and from this the affection of truth for the sake of good use and 
for the sake of life; these make faith to be spiritual. The insinuation of faith by the internal way is effected by the reading of the Word, and by enlightenment then from the Lord, which is granted 
according to the quality of the affection, that is, according to the end sought in knowing the truth.  [5] From all this it can now be seen what faith merely natural is; and that this faith, because 
it is not spiritual, cannot be ascribed to the Lord, that is, be acknowledged and believed to be from the Lord; for the Lord flows in through the affection of truth and good. (That faith is an internal 
affection, see n. 8034.) The truth of innocence, which can be in this faith and be accepted by the Lord, is that which from innocence is believed to be so. From all this it is now evident how it is 
to be understood that faith merely natural must not be ascribed to the Lord, but the truth of innocence which is therein. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8078</b></p><p><b>8078.</b>
'And all that open it among the asses you shall redeem with a member of the flock' means that merely natural faith must not be ascribed to the Lord, only the truth of innocence present within it. This 
is clear from the meaning of 'that which opens' as that which is born first in a regenerate person or is the firstborn, namely faith (it has been shown already that 'the firstborn' means faith); from 
the meaning of 'ass' as the natural, for 'ass' means factual knowledge, <a href="5492.htm">5492</a>, <a href="5741.htm">5741</a>, also subservience, <a href="5958.htm">5958</a>, <a href="6389.htm">6389</a>, and the natural as well (since factual knowledge belongs to the natural, and the natural 
in relation to the spiritual is subservient), so that '[all] that open it among the asses' here means merely natural faith, dealt with below; from the meaning of 'redeeming' as giving something 
else instead (the fact that 'redeeming' has this meaning is evident from the full message implied by these words, which is that 'you shall not make over to Jehovah one that opens it among the asses, but 
you shall redeem it with a member of the flock', </p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 and 'making over to Jehovah' means ascribing to the Lord, just as 'sanctifying' and 'sacrificing' do, see just above in <a href="8074.htm">8074</a>, so that 'not making 
it over but redeeming it' means not ascribing it but giving something else instead); and from the meaning of 'a member of the flock' as the truth of innocence. 'A member of the flock' means the truth 
of innocence because the expression is used to mean lamb or kid, and innocence is meant by these, <a href="3519.htm">3519</a>, <a href="3994.htm">3994</a>, <a href="7840.htm">7840</a>, at this point the truth of innocence since neither the word 'lamb' nor the word 'kid' 
is used, but 'a member of the flock'. From all this it is evident that 'all that open it among the asses you shall redeem with a member of the flock' means that merely natural faith is not to be ascribed 
to the Lord, but the truth of innocence present within it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Merely natural faith is faith that is instilled along the outward but not the inward path. One type of it is faith that depends 
entirely on the senses, which exists when a person believes something to be so because he has seen it with his eye or touched it with his hand. The Lord referred to this kind of faith when He said to 
Thomas, </p>
<blockquote>
Because you have seen, Thomas, you have believed; blessed are those who do not see yet believe. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2020:29&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 20:29</a> 
</blockquote>
<p>Another type is faith induced by miracles, which exists when a person believes 
something to be so solely as a result of miracles; regarding this kind of faith see <a href="7290.htm">7290</a>. And another type is authoritarian faith, which exists when a person believes something to be so because another 
in whom he trusts has declared it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 But spiritual faith is that which is instilled along the inward path at the same time as the outward one. The instilling along the inward path gives rise 
to belief, and what is instilled at the same time along the outward path serves to corroborate it. The spiritual element of faith is charitable affection, and consequently an affection for truth for the 
sake of true service and for life's sake. These cause faith to be spiritual. Faith is instilled along the inward path when a person reads the Word and at the same time receives enlightenment from the 
Lord. This enlightenment is given to him in accordance with his affection, that is, in accordance with the reason he has for wishing to know the truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 These considerations now show what merely 
natural faith is, and that because such faith is not spiritual it cannot be ascribed to the Lord, that is, there can be no acknowledgement or belief that comes from the Lord. For the Lord flows in 
through the affection for truth and good; and faith is an inward affection, see <a href="8034.htm">8034</a>. The truth of innocence which can be present within that merely natural faith and can be accredited to the Lord is 
anything that a person believes in innocence to be true. From all this one may now see how to understand the explanation that merely natural faith must not be ascribed to the Lord, but the truth of innocence 
present within it. </p>

`Et omnem aperturam asini redimes in pecude': quod significet quod fides mere naturalis non addicabitur Domino, sed verum innocentiae quod inibi, constat ex significatione `aperturae' quod sit quod 
primum nascitur a regenerato, seu primogenitum, ita fides; quod `primogenitum' sit fides, hactenus ostensum est; ex significatione `asini' quod sit naturale; per `asinum' enim significatur scientificum, 
n. 5492, (x)5741, tum servitium, n. 5958, 6389, ita quoque naturale, nam scientifica sunt naturalis, ac naturale respective ad spirituale est servitium; inde nunc per `aperturam asini' significatur 
fides mere naturalis, de qua sequitur; {1} ex significatione `redimere' quod sit loco ejus aliud dare; quod `redimere' id significet, patet a sensu pleno horum verborum, qui est {2}quod `aperturam asini 
non 2 transire facies Jehovae, sed redimes pro pecude'; quod `transire facere Jehovae' sit addicare Domino, similiter ac sanctificare et sacrificare, videatur mox supra n. 8074, ita `non transire 
facere sed {3}redimere' est non addicare sed loco ejus aliud dare; et ex significatione `pecudis' quod sit verum innocentiae; quod `pecus' sit verum innocentiae, est quia per `pecudem' intelligitur agnus 
vel haedus, et per hos significatur innocentia, n. (t)3519, 3994, 7840, hic verum innocentiae, quia non agnus seu haedus sed pecus dicitur; ex his patet quod per `omnem aperturam asini redimes in 
pecude' significetur quod fides mere naturalis non addicanda sit Domino, sed verum innocentiae quod inibi. 	3 Fides mere naturalis est fides quae insinuatur per viam externam, et non internam, sicut 
fides sensualis, quae est cum creditur quod ita sit quia oculus vidit et manus tetigit; haec fides est de qua Dominus ad Thomam, Quia vidisti, Thoma, credidisti; beati qui non vident, et credunt, Joh. 
xx 29; </p>
<p>tum sicut fides miraculorum, quae est cum creditur quod ita sit solum ex miraculis, de qua fide videatur n. 7290; ut et fides auctoritatis, quae est cum creditur quod ita sit quia alius cui 
fides habetur dixerat; fides autem spiritualis est {4} quae insinuatur per viam internam et 4 simul externam; insinuatio per viam internam facit ut credatur, et tunc quod insinuatur per viam externam 
facit ut confirmetur; spirituale fidei est affectio charitatis, (c)et inde affectio veri propter usum bonum ac propter vitam; haec faciunt ut fides spiritualis sit; insinuatio fidei per viam internam 
fit per lectionem Verbi, et tunc per illustrationem a Domino, quae datur secundum affectionis quale, hoc est, secundum finem sciendi verum. 	5 Ex his nunc constare potest quid fides mere naturalis, et 
quod illa fides, quia non est spiritualis, non possit addicari Domino, hoc est, agnosci et credi quod sit a Domino, nam Dominus per affectionem veri et boni influit; quod fides sit affectio interna, 
videatur n. 8034 {5}.  Verum innocentiae, {6}quod potest inesse isti fidei, et acceptari a Domino, est quod creditur ita esse ex innocentia.  Ex his nunc patet quomodo intelligendum quod fides mere naturalis 
non addicabitur Domino, sed verum innocentiae quod inibi. 	@1 i et$ 	@2 horum I$ 	@3 redimes$ 	@4 i fides$ 	@5 i des usque in tali fide potest esse aliquid veri innocentiae but first four
