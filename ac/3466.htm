<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3466节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3466.</strong>“因此那城名叫别是巴”表由那结合所产生的教义的本质。这从“名”和“城”的含义清楚可知：“名”是指本质（参看<a href="3465.htm">3465</a>节）；“城”是指教义（参看<a href="402.htm">402</a>，<a href="2449.htm">2449</a>，<a href="2712.htm">2712</a>，<a href="2943.htm">2943</a>，<a href="3216.htm">3216</a>节）。因此，在原文表示“起誓之井”的“别是巴”由此表示确认真理的教义。“别是巴”是指教导（参看<a href="2723.htm">2723</a>，<a href="2858.htm">2858</a>-<a href="2859.htm">2859</a>节）。在创世记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/创21.30.htm">21:30</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创21.31.htm">31</a>），经上说： <br />你要从我手里受这七只母羊羔，作我挖这口井的证据。所以他称那地方为别是巴，因为他们二人在那里起了誓。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创21.30.htm">21:30</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创21.31.htm">31</a>）<br />此处“别是巴”表教义的状态和性质，该教义出自神性，结合通过它而实现。由于那里论述的是那教会的内在特征，故经上说“那地方”被称为别是巴；而此处由于论述的是那教会的外在特征，故经上说“那城”名叫别是巴。因为内在事物涉及状态，而“地方”就表示状态（<a href="2625.htm">2625</a>，<a href="2837.htm">2837</a>，<a href="3356.htm">3356</a>，<a href="3387.htm">3387</a>节）；而外在事物涉及教义，而“城”就表示教义；一切的状态和本质都取决于教会的内在品质。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3466</b></p><p><b>3466.</b>
Therefore the name of the city is Beersheba. That this signifies the quality of the doctrine thence derived, is evident from the signification of "name," as being the quality (see above, n. 3465); and 
from the signification of "city" as being doctrine (see n. 402, 2449, 2712, 2943, 3216); hence comes "Beersheba," which in the original tongue means "the well of the oath," thus the doctrine of confirmed 
truth. (That "Beersheba" is doctrine may be seen above, n. 2723, 2858-2859.) In chapter 21, verses 30-31, it is said: </p>
<p>     Because these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take from my hand, that it may 
be a witness unto me that I have digged this well. Wherefore he called that place Beersheba, because there they sware both of them (Gen. 21:30-31); </p>
<p>where by "Beersheba" was signified the state and 
quality of doctrine, that it was from the Divine, and that by means of it there was conjunction; and because the interiors of that church are there treated of, it is said that "that place" was called 
Beersheba; whereas here, because the exteriors of that church are treated of, it is said that "the city" was so called; for of interior things is predicated state, which is signified by "place" (n. 2625, 
2837, 3356, 3387); but of exterior things is predicated doctrine, which is signified by "city;" for all doctrine has its state and its quality from its interiors. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3466</b></p><p><b>3466.</b>
'Therefore the name of the city is Beersheba' means the essential nature of the doctrine resulting from that conjunction. This is clear from the meaning of 'the name' as the essential nature, dealt with 
immediately above in <a href="3465.htm">3465</a>, and from the meaning of 'the city' as doctrine, dealt with in <a href="420.htm">420</a>, <a href="2449.htm">2449</a>, <a href="2712.htm">2712</a>, <a href="2943.htm">2943</a>, <a href="3216.htm">3216</a>. Consequently Beersheba, which in the original language means 'the well of the 
oath', accordingly means doctrine concerning confirmed truth. That 'Beersheba' means doctrine, see <a href="2723.htm">2723</a>, <a href="2858.htm">2858</a>, <a href="2859.htm">2859</a>. In Chapter 21:30, <a href="31.htm">31</a> above it is said, </p>
<p>Because you will take the seven ewe-lambs 
from my hand, that there may be a witness for me that I dug this well. Therefore he called that place Beersheba, because there the two of them swore an oath. </p>
<p>'Beersheba' at that point meant the state 
and nature of the doctrine that came from the Divine and through which the conjunction was effected. And as the subject was the interior features of that Church it is said that 'that place' was called 
Beersheba, whereas here, the subject being the exterior features of that Church, it is said that 'the city' was so called. For in reference to its interior features the expression 'the place' - meaning 
its state, <a href="2625.htm">2625</a>, <a href="2837.htm">2837</a>, <a href="3356.htm">3356</a>, <a href="3387.htm">3387</a> - is used; but in reference to its exterior features the expression 'the city', meaning doctrine, is used; for the state and the essential nature of doctrine are 
determined by the Church's interior qualities. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 3466</b>
</p><b>3466.</b>
`Propterea nomen urbis Beersheba':  quod significet doctrinae quale inde, constat a significatione `nominis' quod sit quale, de qua mox supra n. 3465; ex significatione `urbis' quod sit doctrina, de 
qua n. 402, (x)2449, 2712, 2943, 3216; inde Beersheba, quae in lingua originali significat puteum juramenti, ita doctrinam veri confirmati; quod `Beersheba' sit doctrina, videatur n. 2723, 2858, 2859. 
Supra in capite xxi, vers. 30, 31, dicitur,           Quia septem agnas accipies e manu mea, propterea sit mihi      in testimonium, quod fodi puteum hunc; propterea vocavit locum      illum Beersheba, 
quia ibi juraverunt ambo illi; </p>
<p>ibi per `Beershebam' significabatur status et quale doctrinae, quod ex Divino, et quod per illam conjunctio; et quia ibi agitur de illius Ecclesiae interioribus, 
dicitur quod `locus ille vocatus sit Beersheba;' hic autem quia agitur de illius Ecclesiae exterioribus, dicitur quod `urbs ita vocata'; de interioribus enim praedicatur status, qui significatur per 
`locum,' n. 2625, 2837, 3356, 3387; sed de exterioribus praedicatur doctrina, quae significatur per `urbem,' nam omnis doctrina suum statum et suum quale habet ab interioribus ejus. </p>
