<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6832.</strong>“从荆棘中间的火焰里”表存在于真正的记忆知识，或记忆知识的真理中的神之爱。这从“火焰”和“荆棘”的含义清楚可知：“火焰”是指神的爱，如下文所述；“荆棘”是指真正的记忆知识或记忆知识的真理。“荆棘”之所以表示真正的记忆知识或记忆知识的真理，是因为各种小灌木表示记忆知识，而树木类的大灌木表示真正的知识或认知和觉知。“荆棘”因开花结果而表示真正的记忆知识，或记忆知识的真理。教会所拥有的真正记忆知识，或记忆知识的真理无非是字义上的圣言，以及存在于雅各后代当中的教会的一切代表形式和有意义的符号。就其外在形式而言，这些真理被称为真正的记忆知识，或记忆知识的真理；但就其内在形式而言，它们是属灵真理。不过，就其内在形式，也就是属灵形式而言，真理无法显现给雅各的后代，因为他们只对外在事物感兴趣，根本不想知道任何内在事物；因此，主在荆棘里显现；事实上，当主显现时，祂是照着这个人的品质显现，因为人只能照自己的品质接受神性。所以，当主在西乃山上显现时，在那百姓看来，祂如同火焰，直烧到天心，并有昏黑、密云和幽暗（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申4.11.htm">4:11</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申5.22.htm">5:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申5.25.htm">25</a>；出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出19.18.htm">19:18</a>）。如果在山下观看的百姓不是这种品质，那么祂就以完全不同的方式显现。因为那百姓只对外在事物感兴趣，所以当摩西上西乃山亲近主时，经上说，他“进入云中”（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出24.2.htm">24:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出24.18.htm">18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.5.htm">34:5</a>）。“云”表示圣言的外在（参看创世记18章序言；<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>，<a href="4391.htm">4391</a>，<a href="5922.htm">5922</a>，<a href="6343.htm">6343</a>e节）；因此，“云”也是所看到的外在形式上的教会的代表。<br />主照各人的品质向各人显现，这一点从以下事实明显看出来：主向那些住在至内层或第三层天堂的天使显为一轮太阳，这太阳发出无法形容的光芒，因为住在那里的天使处于对主之爱的良善；主向那些住在中间层或第二层天堂的天使显为一轮月亮，因为住在那里的天使以较为遥远和模糊的方式处于对主之爱；事实上，他们处于对邻之爱。但在最低层或第一层天堂，主既不显为一轮太阳，也不显为一轮月亮，只显为一种光，这光远远比世上的明亮得多。主因照各人的品质向各人显现，故只能向住在地狱的人显为乌云和漆黑。因为来自主的天堂之光一照到地狱，那里就产生幽暗和漆黑。由此可见，主之所以照各人的品质向各人显现，是因为这适合他接受主的方式。由于雅各的后代只对外在事物感兴趣，所以主在荆棘中向摩西显现，当摩西上西乃山亲近主时，主在云中向他显现。<br />“火焰”之所以表示神的爱，是因为就其起源而言，爱无非是从显为太阳的主而来的火和火焰。正是这太阳的火或火焰将生命的存在赋予每个人；正是赋予生命的火使人的内层充满热；这一点从爱可以看出来，因为随着爱在人里面增长，他会逐渐变得温暖；随着爱消退，他会逐渐变得冷淡。这解释了为何当主在异象中显现时，祂显为火和火焰，如以西结书：<br />至于四活物（就是基路伯）的形像，就如烧着的火炭，如火把的形状；火在活物中间来回移动，如火的光辉，从火中发出闪电。在他们头以上的穹苍之上有宝座的形像，仿佛蓝宝石的形状；在宝座形像以上有仿佛在其上的人的形状。我从祂腰和腰以上的形像见有烧煤的形状；里面周围仿佛都有火的形状；又从祂腰和腰以下见有仿佛火的形像，周围也有光辉。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结1.13.htm">1:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结1.26.htm">26</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结1.27.htm">27</a>）<br />无人能否认，这个异象的所有细节都是代表某种神性之物的符号；但若不知道“基路伯”、“如火把形状的烧着火炭”、“宝座”、“其上的人的形状”、“上下有火的形像的腰和火的光辉”分别表示什么，就不可能知道包含在所有这些细节里面的神圣秘密。“基路伯”是指主的眷顾（Lord's Providence，参看<a href="308.htm">308</a>）；“宝座”是指天堂，准确地说，是指从主发出的、形成天堂的神性真理（<a href="5313.htm">5313</a>节）。“宝座上的人的形状”明显是指主的神性人身；“腰”是指婚姻之爱和源于这爱的一切天堂之爱（<a href="3021.htm">3021</a>，<a href="4277.htm">4277</a>，<a href="4280.htm">4280</a>，<a href="4575.htm">4575</a>，<a href="5050.htm">5050</a>-<a href="5062.htm">5062</a>节）；这爱由“仿佛有火的形状的烧煤形状，周围也有光辉”来代表。<br />但以理书：<br />我观看，直到宝座设立，亘古常在者就坐上去；祂的衣服洁白如雪，头发如纯净的羊毛，宝座乃火焰，其轮乃烧着的烈火。从祂面前有火河发出、流出来。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.9.htm">7:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.10.htm">10</a>）<br />主的神性之爱的神性良善在这个异象中也显为火焰。启示录：<br />骑在白马上的眼睛如火焰。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.12.htm">19:12</a>）<br />“骑在白马上的”是指圣言方面的主，这在经文（19:13，16）中明确说明了；因此，“火焰”是指包含在圣言中的神性真理，这神性真理从主的神性良善发出。<br />七灯台中间有一位好像人子，身穿长衣，直垂到脚。祂的头与发皆白，如白羊毛、如雪，眼目如同火焰。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.13.htm">1:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.14.htm">14</a>）<br />此处“如同火焰的眼睛”是指从主的神性良善发出的神性真理。<br />“火焰”是指从主发出的神性真理，这一点也明显可见于诗篇：<br />耶和华的声音像火焰落下。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗29.7.htm">29:7</a>）<br />“耶和华的声音”是指神性真理。为了能代表从主的神性良善发出的神性真理，百姓被吩咐要用精金做一个带有七个灯盏的灯台，把它放在会幕内陈设饼的桌子旁，要在耶和华面前常点这灯（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.31.htm">25:31</a>至末尾；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出37.17.htm">37:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出37.24.htm">24</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出40.24.htm">40:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出40.25.htm">25</a>；利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利24.4.htm">24:4</a>；民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民8.2.htm">8:2</a>；撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚4.2.htm">4:2</a>）。带有七个灯盏的灯台代表从主的神性良善发出的神性真理。<br />为了还能代表神性良善本身，他们被吩咐坛上要不断烧着火：<br />火要在坛上烧着，不可熄灭；祭司要每日早晨在上面烧柴。火要在坛上不断烧着，不可熄灭。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利6.12.htm">6:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利6.13.htm">13</a>）<br />古人熟知火代表神性之爱，这一点从以下事实明显看出来：这种代表从古教会传播到遥远的偶像崇拜的民族；如众所周知的，他们设立了一种永不熄灭的圣火，并交由处女来守卫，这些处女被称为维斯塔贞女。<br />在反面意义上，“火和火焰”表示污秽的爱，如对报复、残忍、仇恨、奸淫的爱，并且一般表示源于爱自己爱世界的欲望。这也可从圣言中的许多经文明显看出来，仅从中引用以下经文就足够了：<br />看哪，他们必像碎秸，火必要焚烧他们；他们不能救自己的灵魂脱离火焰之手；再没有炭火取暖，也不能再坐在炉火面前！（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛47.14.htm">47:14</a>）<br />以西结书：<br />看哪，我要在你那里点火，烧灭你中间的一切绿树和一切枯树；猛烈的火焰必不熄灭，从南到北，人的脸面都被烧焦。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结20.47.htm">20:47</a>）<br />“火”和“火焰”表示对邪恶和虚假的<br />贪欲，这些贪欲灭绝了教会的一切良善和真理，教会由此变得荒凉。<br />路加福音：<br />财主对亚伯拉罕说，我祖亚伯拉罕哪，可怜我吧！打发拉撒路来，用指头尖蘸点水，凉凉我的舌头，因为我在这火焰里受折磨。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路16.24.htm">16:24</a>）<br />不知道人的生命之火来自一个不同源头，只知道它来自火元素的人，不可能知道别的，只是以为“地狱之火”是指诸如世上所见的那种火。然而，在圣言中，所指的并不是这后一种火，而是指爱之火，因而是指人的生命之火，从显为太阳的主发出。当这火进入那些专注于与它相反的事物之人中间时，它就转化为恶欲之火；如前所述，这些恶欲就是从自我之爱和尘世之爱所涌出的报复、仇恨和残忍的欲望。这就是折磨那些沦落地狱之人的火，因为当加在他们恶欲上的约束放松时，他们就马上互相攻击，以一种可怕、难以启齿的方式彼此折磨。因为人人都渴望至高无上的权力，想利用或秘密或公开的手段从别人那里夺走属于他的东西。当双方都有这种欲望时，致命的仇恨就会在群体里面发展起来；这些仇恨会导致野蛮行为的发生，尤其利用巫术和幻觉如此行；这些手段不计其数，完全不为世人所知。<br />那些不信属灵事物存在的人，尤其敬拜自然的人，根本不可能被引导相信在生物里面构成内在生命本身的热来自其它源头，而非这个世界的热。因为他们不可能知道，更不会承认有一种天火从显为太阳的主发出，这火是纯粹的爱。因此，他们不可能知道存在于圣言中的无数事物，而在圣言中，这火并不是指其它的火；他们也不可能知道人里面的无数事物，而人是一个接受这火的被造器官。</p>

In a flame of fire out of the midst of the bramble. That this signifies love Divine in the truth of memory-knowledge, is evident from the signification of a "flame of fire," as being love Divine (of 
which below); and from the signification of a "bramble," as being the truth of memory-knowledge. That a "bramble" denotes the truth of memory-knowledge, is because all small shrubs of every kind signify 
memory-knowledges, but the greater shrubs signify real knowledges and perceptions. As a "bramble" produces flowers and berries, it signifies the truth of memory-knowledge. The truth of memory-knowledge 
of the church is nothing else than the Word in the sense of the letter, and also every representative and significative of the church which existed among the descendants of Jacob. In their external 
form these truths are called truths of memory-knowledge, but in the internal form they are spiritual truths. But as truths in the internal form, that is, in their spiritual form, could not appear to 
the posterity of Jacob, because they were in mere externals, and were quite unwilling to learn anything internal, therefore the Lord appeared in the bramble; for when the Lord appears, He appears according 
to the quality of the man, because a man receives the Divine no otherwise than according to his own quality. Therefore when the Lord appeared on Mount Sinai, He appeared to the people as fire 
burning even to the heart of heaven, and as darkness, clouds, and thick darkness (Deut. 4:11; 5:22-25 also Exod. 19:18). He would have appeared altogether otherwise if the people who were looking on beneath 
the mountain had not been of such a quality; and because that people was in mere externals, therefore when Moses entered unto the Lord on Mount Sinai, it is said that he "entered into a cloud" 
(Exod. 24:2, 18; 34:5). That a "cloud" denotes the external of the Word, see the preface to the eighteenth chapter of Genesis, and n. 4060, 4391, 5922, 6343; consequently also it was representative of 
the church as looked at in its outward form. [2] That the Lord appears to everyone according to his quality, is evident from the fact that the Lord appears to those who are in the inmost or third heaven 
as a sun, from which proceeds ineffable light, because those who are there are in the good of love to the Lord; and that He appears to those who are in the middle or second heaven as a moon, because 
those who are there are more remotely and obscurely in love to the Lord, being in love toward the neighbor; but in the lowest or first heaven, the Lord does not appear as a sun nor yet as a moon, 
but only as a light which far surpasses the light of the world. And as the Lord appears to everyone according to his quality, therefore also He cannot appear to those who are in hell except as a dusky 
cloud and thick darkness; for as soon as the light of heaven which is from the Lord sinks down into any hell, shades and darkness are produced there. From all this it can now be seen that the Lord appears 
to everyone according to his quality, because according to his reception; and as the descendants of Jacob were in externals only, therefore the Lord appeared unto Moses in the bramble, and also 
in a cloud, when he entered in unto the Lord upon Mount Sinai. [3] That "flame" denotes love Divine is because love in its first origin is nothing else than fire and flame from the Lord as a sun. It 
is the fire or flame of this sun which gives the being of life to every man; and it is the vital fire itself which fills the interiors of man with heat, as can be seen from love, for in proportion as 
love increases with man, he grows warm, and in proportion as love decreases, he grows cold. [4] Hence it is that when the Lord appeared in vision, He appeared as fire and flame, as in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     
The appearance of the four animals (which were cherubs) was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches; it was going along among the animals, as the brightness of fire, and out of the 
fire went forth lightning. Above the expanse that was over their head was as it were the appearance of a sapphire stone, the likeness of a throne; and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness 
as the appearance of a man upon it above. And I saw the appearance of a burning coal as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins and upward; but from the appearance 
of his loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, which had a brightness round about (Ezek. 1:13, 26-27). That the details of this vision are significative and representative of something 
Divine, no one can deny; but unless it is known what is signified by "cherubs," by "burning coals of fire like the appearance of torches," by a "throne," by the "appearance of a man upon it," 
by the "loins from which was the appearance of fire upward and downward, and brightness from the fire," it is impossible to know the holy secret contained within it. That "cherubs" denote the providence 
of the Lord, see n. 308; that a "throne" denotes heaven, properly the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, which forms heaven, n. 5313. That "the appearance of a man upon the throne above" denotes 
the Lord as to the Divine Human, is plain; that "loins" denote conjugial love and from this all heavenly love, n. 3021, 4277, 4280, 4575, 5050-5062; which love was represented by the appearance of 
burning coal as the appearance of fire, which had a brightness round about. [5] In Daniel: </p>
<p>     I held even until the thrones were cast forth, and the Ancient of days did sit; His garment was like white 
snow, and the hair of His head was like clean wool; His throne was a flame of fire; His wheels were burning fire, a stream of fire issued and went forth from before Him (Dan. 7:9-10); </p>
<p>the Divine 
good of the Lord's Divine love was here also seen as a flame of fire. In John: </p>
<p>     He that sat upon the white horse had eyes as a flame of fire (Rev. 19:12); </p>
<p>that "He that sat upon the white horse" 
is the Lord as to the Word, is there openly said (verses 13, 16); thus the "flame of fire" is the Divine truth which is in the Word, which is from the Lord's Divine good. Again: </p>
<p>     In the midst of 
the seven candlesticks was one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot. His head and hairs were white as white wool, as snow; and His eyes were as a flame of fire (Rev. 1:13-14); </p>
<p>here 
also "eyes as a flame of fire" denotes the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord's Divine good. [6] That a "flame of fire" denotes the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, is evident also 
in David: </p>
<p>     The voice of Jehovah falleth down like a flame of fire (Ps. 29:7); </p>
<p>"the voice of Jehovah" denotes the Divine truth. That the Divine truth might be represented as proceeding from the 
Lord's Divine good, the command was given that they should make a lampstand of pure gold with seven lamps, and that it should be set in the tent of the congregation by the table on which were the loaves 
of setting forth, and that the lamps should burn continually before Jehovah (Exod. 25:31 to the end; 37:17-24; 40:24, 25; Lev. 24:4; Num. 8:2; Zech. 4:2). By the lampstand with the seven lamps was 
represented the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord's Divine good. [7] That the Divine good itself might also be represented, it was commanded that there should be a perpetual fire on the altar: </p>
<p> 
    The fire shall burn upon the altar, and shall not go out; the priest shall kindle pieces of wood upon it every morning. The fire shall burn continually upon the altar, and shall not go out (Lev. 
6:12-13). That fire was very well known to the ancients to be representative of the Divine love is very evident from the fact that this representative spread from the Ancient Church even to remote 
nations which were in idolatrous worship, and who are known to have instituted a sacred perpetual fire, and to have appointed to it virgins, called the vestals. [8] That in the opposite sense "fire and 
flame" signify filthy loves, such as the loves of revenge, of cruelty, of hatred, of adultery, and in general the lusts which are from the loves of self and of the world is evident also from many passages 
in the Word, of which it is enough to cite only the following: </p>
<p>     Behold they are become as stubble, the fire hath burned them; they rescue not their soul from the hand of the flame; no coal 
to warm at, or a fire to sit before (Isa. 47:14).      Behold I will kindle a fire in thee, which shall devour in thee every green tree, and every dry tree; the flame of a grievous flame shall not 
be quenched, whence all faces shall be burned up from the south to the north (Ezek. 20:47); </p>
<p>by "fire" and "flame" are signified the cupidities of evil and falsity, which extinguish all the good and truth 
of the church, whence comes its vastation. [9] In Luke: </p>
<p>     The rich man said to Abraham, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and 
cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame (Luke 16:24); </p>
<p>they who do not know that the fire of life in man is from a different origin than is elementary fire cannot possibly know otherwise than 
that by the "fire of hell" is meant such fire as is in the world; when yet in the Word no such fire is meant, but the fire which is of love, thus which is of man's life, proceeding from the Lord as 
a sun; which fire, when it enters into those who are in things contrary is turned into the fire of cupidities, which, as before said, are those of revenge, hatred, and cruelty, springing forth from the 
love of self and of the world. This is the fire which torments those who are in the hells, for when the rein is given to their cupidities, they rush one upon another, and torture one another in direful 
and unspeakable ways, because everyone desires to be preeminent, and by secret or open artifices to take from another what belongs to him. This being the case on both sides, deadly hatreds come forth 
from it, and from these the perpetration of savage deeds, especially by means of magical arts and also by means of phantasies, which arts are innumerable and are quite unknown in the world. [10] 
They who do not believe in spiritual things, especially the worshipers of nature, can never be brought to believe that the heat in living beings, which makes the internal life itself, is from any other 
origin than the heat of this world; for they cannot know, still less acknowledge, that there is a heavenly fire proceeding from the Lord as a sun, and that this fire is pure love. Consequently they 
cannot know innumerable things that exist in the Word, where no other fire is meant; neither can they know innumerable things in man, who is an organ receptive of this fire. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6832</b></p><p><b>6832.</b>
'In a flame of fire from the middle of a bramble bush' means God's love present in true factual knowledge. This is clear from the meaning of 'a flame of fire' as God's love, dealt with below; and from 
the meaning of 'a bramble bush' as true factual knowledge. The reason why 'a bramble bush' means true factual knowledge is that all shrubs of every kind mean factual knowledge, whereas actual plantations 
of trees, being larger, mean cognitions and perceptions. Because it produces flower and berries 'a bramble bush' means true factual knowledge. True factual knowledge that the Church possesses consists 
in nothing else than the Word as it exists in the sense of the letter and also every one of the Church's representative forms and meaningful signs that existed among the descendants of Jacob. These 
in the external form they take are called true factual knowledge; but in their internal form they are spiritual truths. But truths in their internal or spiritual form could not be made visible to 
those descended from Jacob, for the reason that they were interested solely in things of an external nature and had no wish whatever to know about anything internal. Therefore the Lord appeared in a 
bramble bush (when the Lord appears to people He does so in a way suited to the kind of people they are, for a person cannot receive the Divine in any way other than that which is a way suited to the 
kind of person he is); and therefore also, when the Lord appeared on Mount Sinai He appeared to the people' as a fire burning even to the heart of heaven, and as darkness, cloud, and pitch darkness', 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%204:11;%205:22-25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 4:11; 5:22-25</a>; also <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2019:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 19:18</a>. He would have appeared in an altogether different way if the people below the mountain who beheld Him had not been the kind of people they were. And because those 
people were interested solely in things of an external nature, when Moses went in to the Lord on Mount Sinai, it is said that he went into the cloud, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2020:21;%2024:2,18;%2034:2-5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 20:21; 24:2,18; 34:2-5</a>, 'the cloud' being 
the external aspect of the Word, see Preface to Genesis <a href="18.htm">18</a>, and <a href="4060.htm">4060</a>, <a href="4391.htm">4391</a>, <a href="5922.htm">5922</a>, <a href="6343.htm">6343</a> (end), and also consequently representatives in the Church which are seen in outward form.  </p>

 The truth that 
the Lord appears to each individual person in a way suited to the kind of person he is may be recognized from the consideration that the Lord appears to those in the inmost or third heaven as the Sun 
from which light beyond description radiates, the reason being that those  there are governed by the good of love to the Lord. He appears to those in the middle or second heaven as the Moon, the reason 
being that there they are governed by love to the Lord in a more remote and obscure way; for they are governed by love towards the neighbour. But the Lord does not appear to those in the lowest or 
first heaven either as the Sun or the Moon, only as Light, a light far more brilliant than light in the world. And since the Lord appears to each in a way suited to the kind of person he is, He cannot 
appear to those in hell as anything other than dark cloud and pitch darkness. For as soon as the light of heaven which comes from the Lord shines into any hell, darkness and thick darkness are produced 
there. From all this one may now recognize that the Lord appears to each individual person in a way suited to the kind of person he is, for this is suited to the way he receives the Lord. And since 
the descendants of Jacob were interested solely in things of an external nature, the Lord appeared to Moses in a bramble bush, and also in a cloud when Moses went in to the Lord on Mount Sinai.  </p>

<p><b>[3]</b>
The reason why 'a flame' is God's love is that love in its earliest origin is nothing other than fire or flame from the Lord as the Sun. The fire or flame of this sun is what supplies each individual 
person with the being (esse) of his life; it is that life-giving fire which fills a person's interiors with warmth, as one may recognize from what happens with love. To the extent that love increases 
in a person he warms up; but to the extent that it diminishes he cools off. This explain s why, when the Lord appeared in a vision, He appeared as fire and flame, as in Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
The appearance of 
the four living creatures (who were cherubs) was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of lamps. It was moving between the living creatures as a bright fire, and out of the fire went forth 
lightning. Above the firmament that was over their heads, in appearance like a sapphire stone, there was the likeness of a throne, and over the likeness of a throne there was a likeness as the appearance 
of a man upon it, above. And I saw the shape of burning coals, as the shape of fire, within it round about, from the appearance of His loins and upwards. But from the appearance of His loins and 
downwards I saw as it were the appearance of fire, whose brightness was round about it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%201:13,%2026-28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 1:13, 26-28</a>.

 Nobody can deny that all the several details of this vision are signs that represent 
aspects of the Divine; but unless one knows what is meant by 'the cherubs', 'the burning coals of fire, like the appearance of lamps', 'a throne', 'the appearance of a man upon it', 'his loins from which 
fire emanated upwards and downwards, and the brightness radiating from the fire', one can have no knowledge of the real holiness hidden within all those several details. 'The cherubs' are the Lord's 
Providence, see <a href="308.htm">308</a>; 'the throne' is heaven, or - to be exact - Divine Truth that emanates from the Lord to form heaven, <a href="5313.htm">5313</a>; 'the appearance of a man upon the throne above' is plainly the Lord's 
Divine Human; and 'loins' are conjugial love and all heavenly love that derives from it, <a href="3021.htm">3021</a>, <a href="4277.htm">4277</a>, <a href="4280.htm">4280</a>, <a href="4575.htm">4575</a>, <a href="5050.htm">5050</a>, <a href="5062.htm">5062</a> This love was represented by 'the shape of burning coal, as the shape of fire, 
whose brightness was round about it'.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Daniel, </p>
<blockquote>
I saw, until thrones had been placed, and the Ancient of Days was seated. His clothing was white as snow, and the hair of His head like pure 
wool. His throne was a flame of fire; His wheels were burning fire. A river of five issued and came forth from before Him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%207:9,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 7:9, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The Divine Good of the Lord's Divine Love was seen in this 
vision too as a flame of fire. In John, </p>
<blockquote>
He who sat on the white horse, His eyes were like aflame of fire. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2019:11,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 19:11, 12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'He who sat on the white horse' is the Lord in respect of the Word, as 
is explicitly stated in verses 13,16, of that chapter. Thus 'the flame of fire' is Divine Truth contained in the Word, which radiates from the Lord's Divine Goodness. In the same book,  </p>
<blockquote>
In the midst 
of the seven lampstands one like the Son of Man, clothed with a long robe. His head and hair were white, like white wool, like snow; but His eyes were like a flame of fire. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%201:13,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 1:13, 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 
'eyes like a flame of fire' is Divine Truth emanating from the Lord's Divine Goodness. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 The meaning of 'a flame of fire' as Divine Truth emanating from the Lord is also evident in David,  </p>
<blockquote>
The 
voice of Jehovah falls like a flame of fire. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2029:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 29:7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The voice of Jehovah' stands for Divine Truth. In order that Divine Truth emanating from the Lord's Divine Good might be represented, the 
people were commanded to make a lampstand of pure gold with seven lamps and to place it in the tent of meeting by the table where the leaves of the presence were, and to keep the lamps burning unceasingly 
before Jehovah, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2025:31-end;%2037:17-24;%2040:24,%2025&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 25:31-end; 37:17-24; 40:24, 25</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2024:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 24:4</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%208:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 8:2</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%204:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 4:2</a>. The lampstand with its seven lamps served to represent Divine Truth emanating from the Lord's Divine Good. 
 </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 In order also that Divine Good itself might be represented they were commanded to have perpetual fire on the altar,  </p>
<blockquote>
Fire shall burn on the altar and not be put out; the priest shall kindle 
pieces of wood on it at every dawn. Fire shall burn unceasingly on the altar and not be put out. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%206:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 6:12, 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that the ancients were very well acquainted with the use of fire to represent 
Divine Love may be recognized from the spread of that representative from the Ancient Church even to nations far away whose worship was idolatrous and who, as is well known, established an everlasting 
sacred fire and placed in charge of it virgins, who were called the vestal virgins. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 In the contrary sense 'fire' and 'flame' mean filthy kinds of love, such as those of vengeance, cruelty, 
hatred, and adultery, and in general the cravings that spring from self-love and love of the world. This too is clear from very many places in the Word, of which let just the following be quoted: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, 
they have become as stubble, the fire has burned them; they do not save themselves from the power of the flame.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> There will be no coal to be warmed by [nor] fire to sit in front of. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2047:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 47:14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, I will kindle in you a five, which will devour in you every green tree and every dry tree. The blazing flame<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> will not be put out, and all faces from south to north 
will be scorched by it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2020:47&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 20:47</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'fire' and 'flame' mean desires for what is evil and false which annihilate everything good and true in the Church, and thereby lay it waste.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 In 
Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
The rich man said to Abraham, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2016:24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 16:24</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>People 
who do not know that a person's vital heat has a different origin from that which is the source of elemental fire cannot possibly do anything else but think that by hell fire is meant fire like 
that found in the world. In the Word however this latter kind of fire is not meant but the fire of love, thus the fire of a person's life, emanating from the Lord as a Sun. And when this fire comes among 
those engrossed in pursuits contrary to it, it is turned into the fire of evil desires which, as stated above, belong to vengeance, hatred, and cruelty, and which well up from self-love and love of 
the world. This is the fire that torments those who are in hell, for when the restraint placed on their evil desires is relaxed, one sets upon another and they torment one another in dreadful and indescribable 
ways. For each has the wish for supremacy and wants to take from the other the things he has by hidden or open devices. When one or two have such desires hatreds consequently develop within 
the group, and these lead to the savage deeds that are performed, especially by the use of devices involving magic and the use of figments of the imagination, devices which are countless and totally 
unknown in the world. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[10]</b>
 People who do not believe in the existence of spiritual things, especially those who worship nature, cannot at all be led to believe that the warmth present in living persons, 
which constitutes the actual life within them, has a different origin from that which is the source of worldly heat. For they are not even aware, let alone able to acknowledge, that there is a 
heavenly fire radiating from the Lord as a Sun, and that this Fire is pure love. Consequently they are unaware of countless instances in the Word in which no other kind of fire is meant; nor are they 
aware of countless  manifestations of it in the human being, who is an organ made to receive that fire.

`In flamma ignis e medio rubi': quod significet amorem Divinum in vero scientifico, constat ex significatione `flammae ignis' quod sit amor Divinus, de qua sequitur; et ex significatione `rubi' quod 
sit verum scientificum; quod `rubus' sit verum scientificum, est quia omnes `arbusculae' cujuscumque generis significant scientifica, ipsa autem `arboreta majora' cognitiones et perceptiones; `rubus' 
quia producit flores et bacas, significat verum scientificum.  Verum scientificum Ecclesiae non aliud est quam Verbum in sensu litterae, et quoque omne repraesentativum et significativum Ecclesiae quod 
apud posteros Jacobi; haec in forma sua externa vocantur vera scientifica, at in forma interna sunt vera spiritualia; {1}sed quia vera in forma interna, seu in forma spirituali, non apparere potuerunt 
posteritati ex Jacobo, ex causa quia in solis externis fuerunt et prorsus non scire voluerunt de aliquo interno; idcirco apparuit Dominus in rubo; Dominus enim cum apparet, secundum quale hominis 
apparet, nam homo non aliter recipit Divinum quam secundum quale suum; idcirco etiam cum Dominus apparuit super monte Sinai, apparuit populo `sicut ignis ardens usque ad cor caeli, et sicut tenebrae, 
{2} nubes, et caligo,' Deut. iv 11, v 19-22 [A.V. 22-25], tum Exod. xix 18; apparuisset prorsus aliter si populus qui sub monte aspectabat non talis fuisset; et quia populus ille modo in externis fuit, 
idcirco cum Moses intravit ad Dominum super monte Sinai, dicitur quod `intraverit in nubem,' Exod. xx 18, xxiv 2, 18, (x)xxxiv 2-5; quod `nubes' sit externum Verbi, videatur Praefatio ad Gen. xviii, 
et n. 4060, 4391, 5922, 6343 fin.; consequenter etiam repraesentativum Ecclesiae spectatum in forma externa. 	2 Quod Dominus appareat unicuique secundum quale ejus, constare potest ex eo quod Dominus 
appareat illis qui in intimo seu tertio caelo ut sol, ex quo lux ineffabilis, ex causa quia illi qui ibi in bono amoris in Dominum sunt; et quod appareat illis qui in medio seu secundo caelo ut luna, 
ex causa quia remotius et obscurius ibi in amore in Dominum sunt, sunt enim in amore erga proximum; in ultimo autem seu primo caelo non apparet Dominus ut sol nec ut luna, sed modo sicut lux, quae lux 
multum excedit lucem mundi; et quia Dominus apparet cuique secundum quale ejus, ideo etiam non apparere potest illis qui in inferno aliter quam sicut {3}furva nubes et caligo; nam ut primum lux caeli, 
quae a Domino, in aliquod infernum illabitur, fiunt ibi tenebrae et caligo {4}. Ex his nunc constare potest quod Dominus appareat unicuique secundum quale ejus quia secundum receptionem; et quia posteri 
{5}ex Jacobo erant solum in externis, idcirco apparuit Dominus Mosi in rubo, et quoque in nube cum intravit ad Dominum super monte Sinai. 	3 Quod `flamma' sit amor Divinus, est quia amor in sua 
prima origine non aliud est quam {6} ignis {7}et flamma a Domino ut sole; solis hujus ignis seu flamma est quae dat esse vitae unicuique homini; et est ipse ignis vitalis, qui quod interiora hominis 
calore {8} impleat, constare potest ex amore, quantum enim amor crescit apud hominem, tantum homo calescit; et quantum amor decrescit, tantum frigescit; inde est quod cum Dominus apparuit in visione, 
{9} apparuerit sicut ignis et flamma; ut apud Ezechielem, Aspectus quattuor animalium (quae fuerunt cherubi) sicut prunae ignis (x)ardentes, juxta aspectum lampadum; is incedens inter animalia, ut splendor 
ignis, et ex igne exiens fulgur: supra expansum quod super capite eorum, quasi aspectus lapidis sapphiri, similitudo throni, et super similitudine throni similitudo quasi aspectus hominis super 
illo superius; et vidi speciem prunae ardentis juxta speciem ignis intra illam circumcirca, ab aspectu lumborum Ipsius et sursum, sed ab aspectu lumborum Ipsius et deorsum vidi quasi aspectum ignis, 
cui splendor circumcirca, i 13, (x)26-28; </p>
<p>	4 quod singula in hac visione significativa et repraesentativa Divinorum sint, nullus negare potest, {10}sed nisi scitur quid significatur per `cherubos,' 
per `prunas ignis ardentis juxta aspectum lampadum,' per `thronum,' per `aspectum hominis super illo,' per `lumbos a quibus sursum et deorsum ignis, et ex igne splendor,' nusquam sciri potest sanctum 
arcanum quod inibi; quod `cherubi' sint Providentia Domini, videatur n. 308; quod `thronus' sit caelum, proprie Divinum Verum procedens a Domino quod format caelum, n. 5313; quod `aspectus hominis super 
throno superius' sit Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum, patet; quod `lumbi' sint amor conjugialis et inde omnis amor caelestis, n. 3021, 4277, 4280, 4575, 5050-5062; qui amor repraesentatus est {11} per 
`speciem prunae ardentis juxta speciem ignis 5 cui splendor circumcirca': apud Danielem, Videns fui usque dum throni projecti {12}fuerunt, et Antiquus dierum sedit, vestis Ipsius sicut nix alba, et 
crinis capitis Ipsi sicut lana munda; thronus Ipsius flamma ignis; rotae Ipsius ignis ardens, flumen ignis emanans et exiens a coram Ipso, vii 9, 10; </p>
<p>Divinum Bonum Divini Amoris Domini etiam hic visum 
est ut flamma ignis {13}: apud Johannem, Sedens super equo albo; oculi Ipsius sicut flamma ignis, Apoc. xix [11,] 12; </p>
<p>quod `sedens super equo albo' sit Dominus quoad Verbum, aperte ibi dicitur, vers. 
13, 16; ita `flamma ignis' est Divinum Verum quod in Verbo, quod ex Divino Bono Domini: apud eundem, In medio septem candelabrorum similis Filio hominis, indutus talari, caput Ipsius et capilli 
albi sicut lana alba, sicut nix, sed oculi Ipsius sicut flamma ignis, Apoc. i 13, 14; </p>
<p>hic quoque `oculi sicut flamma ignis' est Divinum Verum procedens a Divino Bono Domini. 	6 Quod `flamma ignis' sit 
Divinum Verum procedens a Domino, patet quoque apud Davidem, Vox Jehovae illabens sicut flamma ignis, Ps. xxix 7; </p>
<p>`vox Jehovae' pro Divino Vero.  Ut repraesentaretur Divinum Verum procedens a Divino 
{14}Bono Domini, mandatum fuit ut candelabrum facerent ex puro auro cum septem lucernis, et quod poneretur in tentorio conventus ad mensam ubi panes propositionis, et quod lucernae arderent jugiter 
coram Jehovah, Exod. xxv 31 ad fin., (x)xxxvii 17-24, xl 24, 25; Lev. xxiv 4; Num. viii 2; Sach. iv 2; per `candelabrum cum septem lucernis' repraesentabatur Divinum Verum procedens a Divino Bono Domini. 	7 
Ut quoque repraesentaretur ipsum Divinum Bonum {15}, mandatum est ut ignis perpetuus esset super altari, Ignis super altari ardebit, {16}et non (x)exstinguetur; sacerdos accendet super eo ligna 
sub auroris singulis: ignis jugiter ardebit super altari, {16}et non exstinguetur, Lev. vi 5, 6 [A.V. 12, 13]. 	Quod `ignis' repraesentativum fuerit Divini Amoris, notissimum antiquis fuerit, {17} 
constare potest ex eo quod repraesentativum hoc emanaverit ab Antiqua Ecclesia usque ad {18} gentes dissitas quae in cultu idololatrico fuerunt, quae quod ignem sacrum perennem instituerint, et ei 
praefecerint virgines quae vestales dictae sunt, notum est. 	8 Quod `ignis' et `flamma' in opposito sensu {19}significent amores spurcos, sicut amores vindictae, crudelitatis, odii, adulterii, et in 
genere concupiscentias quae ex amoribus {20}sui et mundi, constat etiam a pluribus locis in Verbo, quorum haec solum licet afferre: apud Esaiam, Ecce facti sunt sicut stipula, ignis adussit illos, non 
eripiunt animam suam e manu flammae; nulla pruna ad incalescendum, ignis ad sedendum coram eo, xlvii 14: </p>
<p>apud Ezechielem, Ecce Ego incendam in te ignem, qui comedet in te omnem arborem viridem, et 
omnem arborem aridam, non exstinguetur flamma flammae gravis, unde comburentur omnes facies a meridie ad septentrionem, xxi 3 [A.V. xx 47]; </p>
<p>hic per `ignem' et `flammam' (x)significantur cupiditates 
mali et falsi quae exstinguunt omne bonum et verum Ecclesiae, inde hujus vastatio: apud Lucam, 9 Dives dixit ad Abrahamum, Pater Abraham, miserere mei, et mitte Lazarum ut intingat extremum digiti sui 
in aquam, et refrigeret linguam meam, quia crucior in flamma hac, xvi 24; </p>
<p>qui non sciunt quod ignis vitalis apud hominem sit ex alia origine quam ignis elementaris, illi nequaquam aliter scire possunt 
quam quod per `ignem inferni' intelligatur ignis qualis in mundo, cum tamen in Verbo non talis ignis intelligitur sed ignis qui est amoris, ita qui est vitae hominis, procedens a Domino ut Sole, qui 
ignis cum intrat apud illos qui in contrariis sunt, vertitur in ignem cupiditatum quae sunt, ut supra dictum, vindictae, odii, crudelitatis, scaturientes amore sui et mundi; hic ignis est qui cruciat 
illos qui in infernis, nam cum frenum laxatur cupiditatibus illorum, tunc ruit unus alterum, (c)ac diris (c)et ineffabilibus modis se mutuo cruciant; nam quisque supereminere vult et alteri auferre 
quae ejus sunt artibus occultis et apertis; cum haec cupit unus et alter, {21}intestina (t)odia inde existunt, et inde immanitates quae exercentur, imprimis per artes magicas et per phantasias, {22} 
quae artes sunt innumerabiles et prorsus ignotae in mundo. 	10 Qui spiritualia non credunt, imprimis naturae cultores, nusquam possunt induci credere quod calor apud viventes, quae facit ipsam vitam 
internam, ex alia origine sit quam ex qua calor mundi, nam nequeunt scire, minus agnoscere, quod ignis caelestis sit procedens a Domino ut Sole, et quod ille Ignis sit purus amor; inde nec possunt scire 
innumerabilia quae in Verbo ubi non alius ignis intelligitur, nec scire possunt innumerabilia in homine, qui organum recipiens ejus est. 	@1 at$ 	@2 i et$ 	@3 fumus$ 	@4 i adeo ut unus alterum
