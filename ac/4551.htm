<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4551节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4551.</strong>“和他们耳朵上的耳环”表落实在行为中。这从“耳环”的含义清楚可知，“耳环”是代表顺从的象征，因为“耳朵”表示顺从（<a href="2542.htm">2542</a>，<a href="3869.htm">3869</a>节）；顺从的行为就是落实在行为中；事实上，顺从含有付诸行动的意思。此处“落实在行为中”是指要弃绝虚假。至于弃绝虚假，也就是此处内义上的主题，即落实在行为中，有必要用几句话说明一下。人在通过被主重生抵达良善，并出于良善实践真理之前，拥有众多与真理混杂的虚假。事实上，他藉由信之真理被引入重生；在其第一个年龄段，对于信之真理，他只有幼儿和童年时所获知的概念。这些概念都是从世上的外在事物和肉体感官经验形成的，故只会是幻觉，因而是虚假。这些也被落实在行为中，因为人会将他所信的付诸实践。这些虚假就是此处所指的。它们与人同在，直到他重生，也就是直到他出于良善行事。一旦他出于良善行事，良善，也就是藉由良善的主，就会把那时为止他所学到的真理纳入次序；当这一切完成时，虚假就从真理被分离出去，并被去除。人对这一切一无所知；然而，对虚假的这种去除和弃绝却从他童年初期一直持续到其生命的最后阶段。这种活动在每个人里面进行，但在正经历重生的人里面以特殊方式进行。类似活动也发生在未经历重生的人里面，因为当他成长为一个成年人，并且他的判断力趋于成熟时，他觉得其童年的判断很愚笨和荒谬，因而与他现在的想法相去甚远。不过，重生之人与未重生之人的区别在于：重生之人觉得那些不符合信与仁之良善的事和他的想法相去甚远；而未重生之人则觉得那些不符合他所在的爱之快乐的事和他的想法相去甚远。因此，未重生之人视真理为虚假，视虚假为真理。至于耳环，它们有两种，就是戴在鼻子到前额的和戴在耳朵上的。戴在鼻子到前额的，是代表良善的象征，叫鼻环（参看<a href="3103.htm">3103</a>节）；戴在耳朵上的是代表顺从的象征，叫耳环。但在原文，鼻环和耳环是用同一个词来表述的。</p>

And the earrings which were in their ears. That this signifies things actual, is evident from the signification of "earrings," as being badges representative of obedience, for the reason that the "ears" 
signify obedience (n. 2542, 3869); and the things of obedience are things actual, for to obey involves doing in act. Things actual are here predicated of the falsities that were to be rejected. A 
few words shall be said regarding the rejection of falsities, even those which are actual, which is here treated of in the internal sense. Before a man by regeneration from the Lord comes to good, and 
does truth from good, he has very many falsities mixed with truths; for he is introduced by means of truths of faith respecting which in his first age he had no other ideas than those of infancy and 
childhood; which ideas, as they arise from the external things of the world and the sensuous things of the body, cannot but be classed among fallacies, and consequently among falsities. These also become 
actual, for what a man believes, he does. It is these falsities which are here meant. They remain with a man until he is regenerate, that is, until he acts from good, and then the good that is, the 
Lord through the good reduces into order the truths so far learned, and when this is done, falsities are separated from the truths and are removed. [2] Of all this the man is quite ignorant, and yet 
there is such a removal and rejection of falsities from his earliest childhood even to his last age, and this with every man, but especially with him who is being regenerated. The like takes place even 
with a man who is not being regenerated, for when he becomes an adult, and his judgment has attained its maturity, he then regards the judgments of his childhood as vain and absurd, and thus as removed 
far away from him. But the difference between the regenerate man and the unregenerate is that the regenerate regards those things as removed from him which do not agree with the good of faith and 
charity, but the unregenerate those which do not agree with the delight of the love in which he is. The latter therefore for the most part regards truths as falsities and falsities as truths. As regards 
earrings, they were of two kinds, those which were fastened above the nose to the forehead, and those which were fastened to the ears. Those which were fastened above the nose to the forehead were 
badges representative of good, and are called "nose jewels" (see n. 3103); while those which were fastened to the ears were badges representative of obedience, and are "earrings." But in the original 
language both are expressed by the same word. </p>

'And the jewels which were in their ears' means realized in actions. This is clear from the meaning of 'jewels' as symbols representative of obedience, for the reason that by 'the ears' is meant obedience, <a href="2542.htm">2542</a>, <a href="3869.htm">3869</a>, and acts of obedience are realizations in actions; for obeying implies carrying into action. Here the expression 'realized in actions' has reference to the falsities which were to be 
cast aside. But this matter of the casting aside of falsities, which are realized also in actions - the subject at this point in the internal sense - must be discussed briefly here. Before a person 
through being regenerated by the Lord arrives at good and is moved by good to do what is true, he possesses very many falsities mixed up with truths. Indeed he is led into regeneration by means of the 
truths of faith, about which in the first stage of life he has no ideas other than those learned in infancy and childhood. These ideas are formed from external things in the world and from the experiences 
of the physical senses, and therefore they cannot be anything but illusions and consequently falsities, which are also realized in actions; for what a person believes he puts into practice. It is 
these falsities that are meant here. They remain with him until he has been regenerated, that is, until good is the source of his actions. Once this is the situation, good - that is, the Lord by means 
of good - imposes order on the truths which he has learned up to then; and while this is being done the falsities are separated from the truths and taken away. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 A person is totally unaware of 
this happening to him, yet that kind of removal and casting aside of falsities is going on from earliest childhood to the last stage of his life. This activity goes on in everyone, but it doff so in 
a particular manner in one who is being regenerated. In one who is not being regenerated a similar activity is taking place, for when he becomes grown up and he matures in judgement that belongs to that 
stage in life, he regards his childhood judgements as unintelligent and absurd, thus very far removed from what he now thinks. But the difference between one who is regenerate and one who is not is 
that the regenerate regards as being remote from his thinking those things which do not accord with the good of faith and charity, whereas the unregenerate regards as being remote from his thinking those 
which do not accord with the delight he takes in what he loves. The unregenerate therefore, for the most part, regards truths as falsities, and falsities as truths. As regards jewels there were two 
kinds - those fastened above the nose to the forehead and those fastened to the ears. Those fastened above the nose to the forehead were symbols representative of good and were called nose-jewels, 
dealt with in <a href="3103.htm">3103</a>, whereas those fastened to the ears were symbols representative of obedience and are ear-jewels. But in the original language the same word is used to describe both nose-jewel and ear-jewel. </p>

`Et inaures quae in auribus illorum': quod significet actualia, constat (c)a significatione `inaurium' quod sint insignia repraesentativa oboedientiae, quod inde est quia `aures' significant oboedientiam, 
n. 2542, 3869, et quae oboedientiae, ea actualia sunt, nam oboedire involvit actu facere; actualia hic praedicantur de falsis quae rejicerentur.  (m)Quod rejectionem falsorum etiam actualium, 
de qua hic in sensu interno agitur, concernit, paucis dicendum:(n) homo antequam per regenerationem a Domino, venit ad bonum, et ex bono verum facit, plurima falsa mixta veris habet, introducitur 
enim per vera fidei, de quibus (o)in prima aetate non alias quam infantiae et pueritiae ideas habuit, quae ideae quia ab externis quae mundi et (o)a sensualibus quae corporis, existunt, non aliter 
possunt quam inter fallacias, et consequenter inter falsa esse; quae etiam actualia fiunt, nam quae credit homo, haec facit; haec falsa sunt quae hic intelliguntur; </p>
<p>haec manent apud hominem usque 
dum regeneratus est, hoc est, usque dum ex bono agit; tunc bonum redigit vera quae illuc usque hausit, in ordinem, hoc est, Dominus per bonum; hoc cum fit, falsa separantur a veris et removentur: 
[2] haec homo prorsus ignorat, sed usque est talis remotio et rejectio falsorum a prima ejus pueritia usque ad ultimam ejus aetatem; et hoc apud unumquemvis hominem, imprimis autem apud illum qui 
regeneratur; apud illum autem qui non regeneratur, simile occurrit, nam cum adultus fit, et judicium ejus ad aetatem suam pervenit, tunc spectat pueritiae suae judicia sicut inania et ludicra, et 
sic longius a se remota; sed differentia inter regeneratum et non regeneratum est quod regeneratus spectet illa a se remota quae non concordant cum bono fidei et {1} charitatis, at non regeneratus 
illa quae non concordant cum jucundo amoris in quo est, hic itaque utplurimum vera ut falsa, et falsa ut vera {2}.  Quod `inaures' attinet, fuerunt illae duplicis generis; erant quae applicabantur 
supra nasum ad frontem, et erant quae applicabantur auribus; quae applicabantur supra nasum ad frontem, erant insignia repraesentativa boni, et dicuntur monilia, de quibus n. 3103; at quae applicabantur 
auribus, erant insignia repraesentativa oboedientiae, et sunt inaures; sed in lingua originali eadem voce exprimuntur.      @1 seu$      @2 ut falsa quae vera sunt, ac ut vera quae falsa$ </p>
