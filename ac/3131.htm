<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3131.</strong>“拉班跑出来往泉旁去，到那人跟前”表它对那要被引入神圣真理的真理的意向或倾向，也就是良善的情感对那被引入神圣真理的真理的意向或倾向。这从“跑”、“人”和“泉”的含义和“拉班”的代表清楚可知：“跑”明显是指某种意向或倾向，如前所述（<a href="3127.htm">3127</a>节）；“拉班”是指对良善的情感，如下文所述（<a href="3129.htm">3129</a>，<a href="3130.htm">3130</a>节）；“人”（the man）是指真理，如前所述（<a href="265.htm">265</a>，<a href="749.htm">749</a>，<a href="1007.htm">1007</a>节）；“泉”也是指真理，在此是指神圣真理（参看<a href="2702.htm">2702</a>，<a href="3096.htm">3096</a>节，以及下面<a href="3137.htm">3137</a>节）。<br />从此处所论述的这些和其它事可以看出内义的性质，以及它含有何等奥秘。若不通过对圣言的内在探究，同时通过启示，谁能知道“拉班跑出来往泉旁去，到那人跟前”这句话表示良善的情感对那要被引入神圣真理的真理的倾向或意向呢？然而，当世人读到这些话时，这就是天使所感知到的。事实上，世人的观念和天使的观念之间的对应关系就具有这样的性质：即世人照字义理解这些话，只有“拉班跑出来往泉旁去，到那人跟前”这样的观念，而天使却觉察到良善的情感对那要被引入神圣真理的真理的意向或倾向。因为天使对拉班、跑、泉没有任何概念，而只有与这些相对应的属灵观念。这种对应关系就存在于属世之物及基于它们的观念和属灵之物及观念之间，这也可从前面有关对应的阐述（参看<a href="1563.htm">1563</a>，<a href="1568.htm">1568</a>，<a href="2763.htm">2763</a>，<a href="2987.htm">2987</a>-<a href="3003.htm">3003</a>，<a href="3021.htm">3021</a>节）看出来。<br />至于此处所论述的具体事，也就是真理要被引入神圣真理，情况是这样：起初，属世人中的真理并非神圣真理，而是看似神性的真理。因为在真理的最早期，它并非真正的真理，只是真理的表象。然而，随着时间推移，它逐渐脱去表象，披上真理的本质。为理解这一点，可举例说明。不过，目前只能举下面的例子。这是一个神圣真理：主从不发怒，从不惩罚任何人，更不向任何人行恶；从主所发出的，只有良善，没有别的。然而，在它的最早期，该真理声称，当有人犯罪时，主会发怒，并因此惩罚；对有些人来说，它甚至声称邪恶出自主。但随着人的判断力从幼儿开始发育，然后生长并成熟，他便脱去表面上在他看来似乎是真理之物，并逐渐披上真理本身，即主从不发怒，也不惩罚，更不行恶。因此，人正是通过表面真理而被引入真正的真理。因为先进来的是一般概念，它本身是模糊的；在被具体概念启示，这些具体概念又被特定细节启示之前，一般概念里面几乎没有任何事物显现。一旦它被启示，内在事物就清晰可见。幻觉和表象，也就是无知之时的真理，就这样被驱散和逐出。</p>

And Laban ran out of doors unto the man, unto the fountain. That this signifies its desire, that is, the desire of the affection of good, toward the truth which was to be initiated into truth Divine, 
is evident from the signification of running," as manifesting the inclination or desire (as above, n. 3127); from the representation of Laban, as being the affection of good (of which just above, n. 
3129, 3130); from the signification of "the man," as being truth (of which, n. 265, 749, 1007); and from the signification of a "fountain," as also being truth, here truth Divine (see n. 2702, 3096; also 
below, n. 3137).  [2] From these and from the other things here treated of, we can see what is the quality of the internal sense, and what arcana there are in it. Who could know, except from an interior 
searching of the Word, and at the same time from revelation, that these words, "Laban ran out of doors unto the man, unto the fountain," signify the desire of the affection of good toward the 
truth that was to be initiated into truth Divine? And yet this is what the angels perceive when these words are read by man; for such are the correspondences between a man's ideas and an angel's that 
while the man takes these words according to the sense of the letter, and has the idea of Laban as running out of doors to the man unto the fountain, the angel perceives the desire of the affection of 
good toward the truth which was to be initiated into truth Divine. For the angels have no idea of Laban, nor of running, nor of a fountain, but they have spiritual ideas corresponding to these. That 
there is such a correspondence of actual things, and thence of ideas, natural and spiritual, may be seen from what was said above concerning correspondences (see n. 1563, 1568, 2763, 2987-3003, 3021). 
 [3] As regards the actual thing itself, namely, that truth was to be initiated into truth Divine, the case is this: The first truth in the natural man was not truth Divine, but was truth that appeared 
as if Divine; for in its first infancy no truth is truth, but is apparent truth; but in process of time it puts off the appearance, and puts on the essence of truth. In order that this may be comprehended, 
it may be illustrated by examples, but for the present merely by the following. It is a truth Divine that the Lord is never angry, never punishes anyone, still less does evil to anyone, and 
that from the Lord there never comes anything but good; nevertheless in its first infancy this truth takes the form that the Lord is angry when anyone sins, and that therefore the Lord punishes; nay, 
with some that evil is from the Lord; but as a man advances from childhood, and grows up and matures in judgment, he puts off that which was as truth to him from its appearing to be so, and gradually 
puts on the real truth, namely that the Lord is never angry, that He does not punish, that still less does He do what is evil; and thus by the former truth he is initiated into this. For that which first 
enters is the general truth, which in itself is obscure, and in which scarcely anything appears until it has been enlightened by particulars, and these by singulars; and when it has been enlightened 
the interior things are clear. Thus fallacies and appearances, which in time of ignorance are truths, are dissipated and shaken off. </p>

'And Laban ran to the man outside, to the spring' means its inclination, that is to say, the inclination of the affection for good towards truth that was to be introduced into Divine truth. This is clear 
from the meaning of 'running' as some leaning or inclination towards, as above in <a href="3127.htm">3127</a>; from the representation of 'Laban' as the affection for good, dealt with immediately above in <a href="3129.htm">3129</a>, <a href="3130.htm">3130</a>; from 
the meaning of 'men' as truth, dealt with in <a href="265.htm">265</a>, <a href="749.htm">749</a>, <a href="1007.htm">1007</a>; and from the meaning of 'a spring' also as truth, here Divine truth, dealt with in <a href="2702.htm">2702</a>, <a href="3096.htm">3096</a>, and below in <a href="3137.htm">3137</a>. </p>

 These considerations 
and everything else dealt with show the nature of the internal sense and what arcana exist there. Except from interior exploration of the Word and at the same time from revelation, how can anyone 
know that these words - 'Laban ran to the man outside, to the spring' - mean the inclination of the affection for good towards truth that was to be introduced into Divine truth? Yet these are the things 
that angels perceive when these words are read by man. Indeed such are the correspondences between man's ideas and an angel's ideas that while man understands these words according to the sense 
of the letter and has the idea of Laban running to the man outside, to the spring, an angel perceives the inclination of the affection for good towards truth that was to be introduced into Divine truth. 
With angels there is no idea of Laban, or of running, or of a spring, but spiritual ideas corresponding to these. The existence of such correspondence between natural things and ideas based on these 
and spiritual things and ideas may also be seen from what has been stated about correspondences in <a href="1563.htm">1563</a>, <a href="1568.htm">1568</a>, <a href="2763.htm">2763</a>, <a href="2987.htm">2987</a>-<a href="3003.htm">3003</a>, <a href="3021.htm">3021</a>. </p>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 As to the specific matter dealt with here - that truth was 
to be introduced into Divine truth - the situation is that at first truth in the natural man was not Divine truth but truth that had the appearance of being Divine. For no truth in its earliest stages 
is the actual truth but an appearance of truth. In the course of time however it sheds the cloak of appearance and puts on the real essence of truth. To make this intelligible it can be illustrated 
by examples, for the moment by this alone: It is a Divine truth that the Lord is never angry, never punishes anyone, let alone does evil to anyone, and that from the Lord nothing but good ever comes. 
Nevertheless in its earliest stages this truth declares that the Lord is angry when someone sins, and that the Lord therefore punishes; indeed with some people it declares that evil comes from the Lord. 
But as a person progresses from early childhood, grows up, and matures in judgement he casts away that which from the appearance seemed to him to be the truth and gradually takes up the truth itself, 
which is that the Lord is never angry and does not punish, let alone perform evil. Accordingly it is by means of apparent truth that a person is introduced into actual truth; for it is a general concept 
that enters first, which in itself is obscure, containing scarcely anything that is to be seen until it has been enlightened by means of particular ideas, and these in turn by specific details. 
And once it has been enlightened interior things are discernible. In this way the delusions and appearances which are truths at the time of ignorance are dispersed and banished. </p>

`Et currebat Laban ad virum foras ad fontem': quod significet animum ejus, nempe affectionis boni, erga verum, quod initiandum vero Divino, constat ex significatione `currere' quod sit propensionis 
seu animi, ut supra n. 3127; ex repraesentatione `Labanis' quod sit affectio boni, de qua mox supra n. 3129, 3130; ex significatione `viri' quod sit verum, de qua n. 265, 749, 1007; et ex significatione 
`fontis' quod etiam sit verum, hic verum Divinum, de qua n. 2702, 3096, et infra n. (x)3137. [2] Ex his et ceteris, de quibus actum, constare potest qualis est sensus internus, et quae arcana sunt 
ibi; quis scire potest, nisi ex interiore scrutatione Verbi, et simul ex revelatione, quod haec, nempe `currebat Laban ad virum foras ad fontem' significet animum affectionis boni erga verum quod initiandum 
vero Divino, usque tamen haec sunt quae percipiunt angeli cum haec verba leguntur ab homine; tales enim correspondentiae sunt inter ideas hominis et ideas angeli, ut dum homo capit illa secundum 
sensum litterae, et ideam habet Labanis quod cucurrerit ad virum foras ad fontem, angelus percipiat animum affectionis boni erga verum quod initiandum vero Divino; angelis enim nulla idea est `Labanis,' 
nec `currendi,' nec `fontis,' sed ideae spirituales illis correspondentes. Quod {1}talis sit correspondentia rerum et inde idearum naturalium et {2}spiritualium etiam constare potest ex illis quae 
de correspondentiis n. 1563, 1568, 2763, 2987-3003, 3021 dicta sunt. [3] Quod ipsam rem attinet, {3}quod nempe verum initiandum vero Divino, ita se habet, quod primum verum in naturali homine, non fuerit 
verum Divinum, sed verum apparens sicut Divinum; omne enim verum in sua prima infantia non est verum, sed apparens veri, progressu tamen temporis exuit apparentiam, et induit essentiam veri; hoc 
ut capiatur, illustrari potest exemplis, pro tempore, hoc unico; verum Divinum est quod Dominus nusquam irascatur, nusquam aliquem puniat, minus alicui malum faciat, et quod a Domino nusquam aliud veniat 
quam bonum; hoc verum in prima sua infantia usque ita se habet, nempe quod Dominus irascatur cum aliquis peccat, quodque Dominus ideo puniat, immo apud quosdam, {4}quod malum a Domino ; ut autem 
progreditur homo ab infantia, et adolescit ac maturescit judicio, illud quod fuit ei sicut verum ex apparentia quod ita esset, exuit, et paulatim induit ipsum verum, nempe quod Dominus nusquam irascatur, 
nec puniat, minus malum faciat, ita per illud verum initiatur in hoc; est enim commune quod primum intrat, quod in se obscurum est, in quo vix aliquid apparet priusquam illustratum est per particularia, 
et haec per singularia, et tunc cum illustratum est, interiora patent: ita fallaciae et apparentiae, quae sunt vera tempore ignorantiae, dissipantur et discutiuntur. @1 i enim$  @2 i idearum$
