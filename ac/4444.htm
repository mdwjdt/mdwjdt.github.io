<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4444节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4444.</strong>“听见这事，人人痛心，极其恼怒”表他们陷入反对古人当中的教会真理的邪恶。这从“痛心和极其恼怒”的含义清楚可知，“痛心和极其恼怒”在此是指陷入邪恶。接着这邪恶就反对古人当中的教会真理，因为它反对哈抹的儿子示剑，而示剑表示古人当中的真理，如前所述（<a href="4430.htm">4430</a>，<a href="4431.htm">4431</a>节）。从下文明显可知，他们陷入邪恶，因为他们以诡诈说话（34:13），然后在示剑和哈抹满足他们的要求后，便杀了他们（34:26-29）。因此，“痛心和极其恼怒”在此表示他们陷入邪恶。按照接下来的话判断，即“因示剑在以色列中作了丑事，与雅各的女儿同寝，这本是不应该作的”，还有本章末尾：“他们说，他岂可待我们的妹子如同妓女吗”（34:31），他们的行为看似是由示剑与他们的妹子同寝而在他们里面所激起的激情。但这不是激情，因为激情不可能存在于陷入邪恶的人身上，只存在于处于良善的人身上，激情拥有良善在里面（<a href="4164.htm">4164</a>节）。<br />诚然，存在于他们后代当中的宗教表象拥有良善在里面，因为它的一切细节和每个细节都代表主国度的属天和属灵事物。但就那些处于这种宗教表象的人而言，它根本没有任何良善在里面，因为他们唯独局限在没有内在的外在事物，如前所示。这个民族所拥有的宗教表象也一样，如今仍在他们当中盛行。他们承认摩西和众先知，因而承认圣言。圣言本身是神圣的，但对他们来说是不神圣的，因为他们在其一切细节中看到他们自己，从而使圣言变得世俗化。事实上，他们使圣言沦为地上的某种事物，因为他们不知道，甚至不关心它里面的任何天上事物。如果一个人民的状态成了这个样子，那么当他们自己的宗教表象主宰他们时，良善就不可能存在于他们里面。相反，邪恶会出现；事实上，天上的事物不会流入他们里面，因为他们会毁灭它。<br />此外，按照古教会也知道的律法，凡强污处女的人要交出聘礼，娶她为妻，如以下摩西五经中的话所规定的：<br />人若引诱没有受聘的处女，与她同寝，他总要交出聘礼，娶她为妻。若女子的父亲决不肯将女子给他，他应付出和处女聘礼一样多的银钱。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出22.16.htm">22:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出22.17.htm">17</a>）<br />别处：<br />若有男子遇见没有订婚的处女，抓住她与她同寝，被人发现，与她同寝的这男子就要拿五十舍客勒银子给少女的父亲，因他强污了她，尽他一生的日子不可休她。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申22.28.htm">22:28</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申22.29.htm">29</a>）<br />古人也知道这条律法，这一事实从示剑对这少女的父亲和弟兄们所说的话很明显地看出来：<br />示剑对她父亲和弟兄们说，但愿我在你们眼前蒙恩，你们向我要什么，我都会给。任凭向我要多重的聘金和礼物，我必照你们向我所说的给你们，只要把这少女给我为妻。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创34.11.htm">34:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创34.12.htm">12</a>）<br />又因示剑愿意遵行这律法，底拿的弟兄们应允了，只要他照接下来的话给所有的男丁都行割礼，和他们一样：<br />惟有一个条件才可以应允，若你们所有的男丁都受割礼，和我们一样，我们就把女儿给你们，也娶你们的女儿，我们便与你们同住，成为一样的人民。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创34.15.htm">34:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创34.16.htm">16</a>）<br />因此，很明显，底拿的弟兄们并没有照律法行事，因而不是以良善为动机，而是违反律法，因而是以邪恶为动机。<br />诚然，他们的律法禁止他们与外邦民族通婚，如摩西五经所述：<br />又为你的儿子娶他们的女儿，他们的女儿随从他们的神，就行邪淫，使你的儿子也随从他们的神行邪淫。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.16.htm">34:16</a>）<br /><br />不可与列族结亲，不可将你的女儿嫁他的儿子；也不可叫你的儿子娶他的女儿，因为他必使你儿子转离不跟从我，去事奉别神。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.3.htm">7:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.4.htm">4</a>）<br />不过，这条律法是针对外邦民族制定的，以防止以色列人因与他们通婚从真正的代表性敬拜转向偶像崇拜；因为他们一旦变成崇拜崇拜者，就不能再代表主国度的属天和属灵事物，只能代表它们的反面，也就是地狱的事物。事实上，他们一旦成为偶像崇拜者，就会从地狱召唤出他们所敬拜并将神性代表所应用于的某个魔鬼，故经上说：他们不可“随从他们的神行邪淫”。之所以制定这条律法，还有另一个原因，就是“列族”表示以色列人所代表的良善与真理不可与之混合的邪恶与虚假，因而表示魔鬼和地狱之物不可与属天和属灵之物混合（参看<a href="3024.htm">3024</a>e节）。<br />但决不禁止他们与那些接受他们的敬拜，并且在受割礼后承认耶和华的民族通婚。他们称这些人为“寄居在他们中间的外人”，在摩西五经，经上如此论及这些人：<br />若有外人寄居在你们中间，愿向耶和华守逾越节，他所有的男丁务要受割礼，然后才容他前来遵守，他也就像本地居民一样；居民和寄居在你们中间的外人同归一例。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.48.htm">12:48</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.49.htm">49</a>）<br /><br />若有外人寄居在你们中间，愿意向耶和华守逾越节，他要照逾越节的律例、典章行，不管是寄居的是本地人，同归一例。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民9.14.htm">9:14</a>）<br />他们之所以被称为“寄居在他们中间的外人”并且“与他们一起”，是因为“寄居”表示接受教导；因此，“外人或寄居的”（sojourner）表示那些允许自己在律例和教义事物上接受教导的人（参看<a href="1463.htm">1463</a>，<a href="2025.htm">2025</a>，<a href="3672.htm">3672</a>节）。摩西五经：<br />若有外人寄居在你们中间，愿意将馨香的火祭献给耶和华，你们怎样办理，他也要照样办理。至于会众，你们和寄居的外人都归一例，作为你们世世代代永远的定例。在耶和华面前你们怎样，寄居的也要怎样。<br />你们和寄居在你们中间的外人，当有一样的条例一样的典章。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.14.htm">15:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.16.htm">16</a>）<br />别处：<br />与你们一起寄居的外人，你们要看他如本地人一样。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利19.34.htm">19:34</a>）<br />不管是寄居的、是本地人、你们只能有一样的典章。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利24.22.htm">24:22</a>）<br />不仅雅各和他的儿子们知道这律例，示剑和哈抹也知道，这一事实从他们所说的话明显看出来；因为颁布给以色列和犹太民族的律例、典章和律法并不是新的，乃是诸如以前存在于古教会，以及自希伯起被称为希伯来的第二代古教会当中的那类，如前所示。从下面这些话明显看出，他们是知道这条律法的：<br />雅各的儿子们对哈抹和示剑说，我们不能照这话去做，把我们的妹子给有阳皮的人，因为那是我们的羞辱。惟有一个条件才可以应允，若你们所有的男丁都受割礼，和我们一样，我们就把女儿给你们，也娶你们的女儿，我们便与你们同住，成为一样的人民。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创34.14.htm">34:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创34.16.htm">16</a>）<br />这同样从哈抹和示剑的话明显看出来，因为他们不仅同意了，还使自己和他们城里的所有男丁都受了割礼（34:18-24）。<br />由此明显可知，示剑成了这律法中所论及的外人，因而能娶雅各的女儿为妻；因此杀他们是难以启齿的恶行，雅各临死前也见证了这一点（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.5.htm">49:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.7.htm">7</a>）。不仅犹大，而且摩西，以及犹太人和以色列人的王，并这百姓中的许多人都从外邦民族那里娶妻，这一事实从圣言的历史明显看出来；毋庸置疑，这些妻子接受了他们的律例、典章和律法，并被视为寄居的外人。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4444</b></p><p><b>4444.</b>
As they heard it, and the men were grieved, and they were very angry. That this signifies that they were in evil against the truth of the Church among the Ancients, is evident from the signification 
of being "grieved and very angry," as being to be in evil. That this was against the truth of the Church among the Ancients, follows, because it was against Shechem the son of Hamor, by whom is signified 
the truth among the ancients, as before said (n. 4430, 4431). That they were in evil is evident from what follows, in that they spoke with fraud (verse 13), and then, after Shechem and Hamor had complied 
with their demands, they slew them (verses 26-29). Thus by being "grieved and very angry" is here signified that they were in evil. It appears as if these words signify zeal because he lay with 
their sister, according to the words which presently follow: "Because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter, and so it ought not to be done;" and at the end of the chapter: "They 
said, Shall he make our sister as a harlot?" (verse 31); but it was not zeal, for zeal is impossible with anyone who is in evil, being possible only with him who is in good, because zeal has good 
within it (n. 4164). [2] It is true that the religiosity which existed with their posterity had good within it, for each and all things of it represented the celestial and spiritual things of the Lord's 
kingdom; but as regards those who were in that religiosity it had no good within it, for they were in mere externals without internals, as shown above. The case herein is the same as it is with the 
religiosity of that nation as now prevalent among them: they acknowledge Moses and the prophets, thus the Word, which in itself is holy, but as regards them it is not holy, for in everything therein 
they regard themselves, and thus make the Word worldly, nay, earthly, for that there is anything heavenly in it they do not know and neither do they care. They who are in such: a state cannot be in 
good when in their religiosity, but in evil, for nothing heavenly flows in, because they extinguish it in themselves. [3] Moreover, it was according to a law known in the Ancient Church that he who forced 
a virgin should give a dowry and take her for his wife, as thus stated in Moses: </p>
<p>     If a man persuade a virgin who is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall endow her with a dowry to be his 
wife. If refusing her father refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay silver, as much as is the dowry of virgins (Exod. 22:15-16). And elsewhere: </p>
<p>     If a man find a damsel who is a virgin, who 
has not been betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be caught, the man who lay with her shall give the damsel's father fifty pieces of silver, and she shall be his wife, because he 
forced her, and he may not put her away all his days (Deut. 22:28-29). That this same law was known to the ancients is very evident from the words of Shechem to the damsel's father and brothers: "Shechem 
said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye say unto me I will give. Multiply upon me exceedingly dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall 
say unto me, and give me the damsel for a woman" (verses 11, 12). And as Shechem desired to fulfill this law, and Dinah's brothers gave their consent provided that be would become as they were by circumcising 
every male, according to the words which follow: "Nevertheless in this will we consent unto you, if ye will be as we are, that every male with you be circumcised, we will both give our daughters 
to you, and will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will be one people" (verses 15, 16), it is evident that Dinah's brothers did not act from the law (thus not from good), 
but contrary to the law, and consequently from evil. [4] It was indeed according to their law that they should not enter into marriages with the nations, as stated in Moses: "Lest thou take of their 
daughters for thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods" (Exod. 34:16); and again: "Thou shalt not contract kinship with the nations, 
thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, and his daughter thou shalt not take unto thy son, because he will turn aside thy son from following Me, that they may serve other gods" (Deut. 7:3-4); 
but this law was given in regard to idolatrous nations, lest by marriages with them the sons of Israel should turn aside from truly representative worship to idolatrous worship; for when they became 
idolaters they could no longer represent the celestial and spiritual things of the Lord's kingdom, but the opposites, which are infernal, for they then called forth from hell a certain devil whom 
they worshiped, and to whom they applied the Divine representatives, and therefore it is said, "Lest they go a whoring after their gods." This law was given for the additional reason that by the "nations" 
were signified the evils and falsities with which the goods and truths represented by the sons of Israel were not to be commingled, consequently not diabolical and infernal things with heavenly and 
spiritual things (see n. 3024e). [5] But they were never forbidden to intermarry with the nations who accepted their worship, and who after being circumcised acknowledged Jehovah. These they called 
"sojourners sojourning with them," who are thus spoken of in Moses: </p>
<p>     If a sojourner shall sojourn with thee, and be willing to keep the passover to Jehovah, let all his males be circumcised, and 
then let him come near and keep it, and he shall be as an inhabitant of the land; there shall be one law for the inhabitant and for the sojourner that sojourneth in the midst of you (Exod. 12:48-49). And 
again: </p>
<p>     When a sojourner shall sojourn with you, he shall keep the passover unto Jehovah; according to the statute of the passover, and according to the statutes thereof, so shall he do; one 
statute shall there be for you, both for the sojourner and for the native of the land (Num. 9:14). The reason why they were called "sojourners sojourning in the midst of them" and "with them" was 
that "to sojourn" signified to be instructed; and therefore a "sojourner" signified those who suffered themselves to be instructed in the statutes and doctrinal things. (That "to sojourn" and a "sojourner" 
have this signification may be seen above, n. 1463, 2025, 3672.) In the same: </p>
<p>     If a sojourner shall sojourn with you who shall have made a fire-offering of an odor of rest unto Jehovah, as 
ye do, so he shall do: as to the assembly, there is one statute for you and for the sojourner that sojourneth, a statute of eternity for your generations; as ye are, so is the sojourner before Jehovah; 
one law and one judgment shall be for you and for the sojourner that sojourneth with you (Num. 15:14-16).      As the native of you shall be the sojourner that sojourneth with you (Lev. 19:34).  One 
judgment shall there be for you, such as is for the sojourner, such shall be for the native (Lev. 24:22). [6] That this statute was known not only to Jacob and his sons, but also to Shechem and Hamor, 
is evident from their words; for the statutes, judgments, and laws that were given to the Israelitish and Jewish nation were not new, but such as had previously existed in the Ancient Church and 
in the second Ancient Church which was called Hebrew from Eber, as has been shown. That consequently this law was known is evident from the words, "The sons of Jacob said to Hamor and Shechem, We cannot 
do this word, to give our sister to a man who has a foreskin, for this is a reproach to us; nevertheless in this will we consent to you, if ye will be as we, to circumcise for you every male, we will 
both give our daughters to you, and will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you and will be for one people" (verses 14-16); and the same is evident from the words of Hamor and Shechem, 
in that they not only consented, but also caused themselves and every male of their city to be circumcised (verses 18-24). [7] Hence it is evident that Shechem became a sojourner such as is spoken 
of in the law, and thus could take the daughter of Jacob for a woman; so that to kill them was a wicked deed, as Jacob also testified before his death (Gen. 49:5-7). That not only Judah, but also Moses, 
and also the kings of the Jews and of the Israelites, and also many of the people, took wives from the nations, is evident from the historicals of the Word; and that these wives received their statutes, 
judgments, and laws, and were acknowledged as sojourners, is not to be doubted. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4444</b></p><p><b>4444.</b>
.'When they heard; and the men were grieved and blazing with anger' means that they were under the influence of evil that was directed against the truth of the Church among the Ancients. This is clear 
from the meaning of 'being grieved and blazing with anger' here as being under the influence of evil. Its direction against the truth of the Church among the Ancients follows because the anger was against 
Shechem the son of Hamor, who means the truth known to the Ancients, as stated above in <a href="4430.htm">4430</a>, <a href="4431.htm">4431</a>. Their being under the influence of evil is evident from details given further on, namely that 
they spoke deceitfully, verse 13, and then after Shechem and Hamor had submitted to their demands they killed them, verses 26-29. Consequently 'being grieved' here and 'blazing with anger' mean that they 
were under the influence of evil. Their action looks like zeal aroused in them because he had lain with their sister, to judge by the words which immediately follow 'because he had done something 
disgraceful in Israel by lying with Jacob's daughter, a thing that ought not to be done' - and by those at the end of the chapter 'They said, Is he going to treat our sister like a prostitute?' verse 31. But it was not zeal, for zeal cannot possibly exist with someone who is under the influence of evil, only with one governed by good; for zeal has good within it, <a href="4164.htm">4164</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The semblance of religion 
which existed among their descendants did indeed have good within it, in that all its details, each one, represented the celestial and spiritual things of the Lord's kingdom. But in the case of those 
with whom it existed it did not hold anything good at all since they were confined solely to external things devoid of internal, as shown above. It is the same with the semblance of religion possessed 
by that nation among whom it exists even at the present day. They acknowledge Moses and the Prophets, and so the Word. In itself this is holy but in their case it is not holy, for within every detail 
there they see themselves and so that which is worldly. Indeed they turn the Word into something earthly, for they do not know or even care about anything heavenly within it. If the state of a people 
is like this, no good can exist in them when their own semblance of religion holds sway over them. Instead evil is present, for nothing heavenly enters into them because they will annihilate it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
There was a law, also known in the Ancient Church, according to which anyone who ravished a virgin had to provide her with a dowry and take her to be his wife, as the following words in Moses 
laid down, </p>
<blockquote>
If a man persuades a virgin who is not betrothed, and lies with her, he shall endow her with a dowry to be his wife; if her father utterly refuses to give her to him he shall weigh silver 
according to the dowry of virgins. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2022:16,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 22:16, 17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere, </p>
<p>If a man finds a young woman, a virgin, who is not betrothed, and he seizes her and lies with her, and they are discovered, the 
man who lay with her shall give to the young woman's father fifty pieces of silver, and she shall become his wife, because he ravished her; and he will not be able to divorce her all his days. Deut. 
22:28, <a href="29.htm">29</a>. </p>
<p>The fact that this same law was known to the Ancients is quite evident from Shechem's words to the young woman's father and brothers, </p>
<p>Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, 
Let me find grace in your eyes, and I will give that which you tell me. Increase the dowry and gift to any size and I will give you whatever you tell me, and give me the young woman for a wife. Verses 
11, 12. </p>
<p>Also, because Shechem was willing to fulfill this law and Dinah's brothers gave their consent provided he became as they themselves were, by circumcising every male, according to the words 
that follow </p>
<p>Only on this [condition] will we consent to you: If you will be as we are, by circumcising every male among you, then we will give our daughters to you, and your daughters we will take 
to ourselves, and we will dwell with you, and we wit be one people. Verses 15, 16 </p>
<p>- it is therefore evident that they did not act in conformity with the law, thus were not motivated by good, but 
acted contrary to the law, and consequently were motivated by evil. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The law forbade them, it is true, to enter into marriages with the gentile nations, as laid down in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Lest you take their 
daughters for your sons, and their daughters go whoring after their gods, and they cause your sons to go whoring after their gods. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2034:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 34:16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere, </p>
<p>You shall not establish a marriage 
relationship with the nations; you shall not give your daughter to his son, and you shall not take his daughter for your son, for he will turn your son from following Me, to serve other gods. Deut. 
7:3, <a href="4.htm">4</a>. </p>
<p>But this law referred to idolatrous nations. It was laid down to prevent their turning away, through such marriages, from truly representative worship to idolatrous worship; for once they 
became idolaters they were no longer able to represent the celestial and spiritual things of the Lord's kingdom, only their opposites, namely the things of hell. In fact, once they were idolaters, they 
summoned from hell a certain devil whom they worshipped and to whom they applied Divine representatives. This accounts for its being said that they were not to go whoring after their gods. That law 
was also laid down for the further reason that 'the rations' means evils and falsities with which the goods and truths which they represented were not to be mingled, and therefore devilish and hellish 
things were not to be mingled with celestial and spiritual ones, <a href="3024.htm">3024</a> (end). </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 But they were in no way forbidden to contract marriages with nations who willingly adopted their worship and who, 
after being circumcised, acknowledged Jehovah. These they called sojourners sojourning with them, of whom the following is said in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
If a sojourner sojourns with you and wishes to keep the Passover 
to Jehovah, every male he has shall be circumcised, and then he shall come near and keep it; and he will be as an inhabitant of the land. There shall be one law for the inhabitant and for the sojourner 
who sojourns in the midst of you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2012:48,%2049&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 12:48, 49</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere, </p>
<blockquote>
When the sojourner has sojourned with you, he shall keep the Passover to Jehovah according to the statute for the Passover, 
and according to the regulations<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> for it. There shall be one statute for you, both for the sojourner and for the native of the land. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%209:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 9:14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The reason why they were called sojourners sojourning 
in the midst of them and with them was that 'sojourning' meant receiving instruction, and so 'a sojourner' those who allowed themselves to receive instruction in statutes and matters of doctrine, 
see <a href="1463.htm">1463</a>, <a href="2025.htm">2025</a>, <a href="3672.htm">3672</a>. In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
If a sojourner should sojourn with you who would make a fire-offering of an odour of rest to Jehovah, he shall do as you do. As for the assembly, one statute 
shall there be for you and for the sojourner who sojourns, an eternal statute throughout your generations. As you are, so shall the sojourner be before Jehovah. There shall be one law and one judgement 
for you and for the sojourner sojourning with you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2015:14-16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 15:14-16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere, </p>
<blockquote>
As the native among you shall the sojourner sojourning with you be to you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2019:34&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 19:34</a>. 
</blockquote>
One judgement shall 
there be for you; it shall be for the sojourner as for the native. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2024:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 24:22</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 The fact that this statute was known not only to Jacob and his sons but also to Shechem and Hamor is evident from 
the words spoken by them. For the statutes, judgements, and laws which were given to the Israelite and Jewish nation were not new but such as existed previously in the Ancient Church and in the second 
Ancient Church which, from Eber, was called the Hebrew, as has been shown in various places. The consequent knowledge of this law is evident from the words of Jacob's sons, </p>
<p>Jacob's sons said to 
Hamor and Shechem, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to a man who has a foreskin; for that would be a reproach to us. Only on this [condition] will we consent to you: If you will be as we are, 
by circumcising every male among you, then we will give our daughters to you, and your daughters we will take to ourselves, and we will dwell with you, and we will be one people. Verses 14-16. </p>
<p>That 
knowledge is also evident from Hamor and Shechem's words, in that they not only consented but also did cause themselves and every male of their city to be circumcised, verses 18-24. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 This shows 
that Shechem became a sojourner such as is referred to in the Law, and so could take Jacob's daughter as a wife; and that their killing them was accordingly an unmentionable deed, as Jacob also bore 
witness before his death, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2049:5-7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 49:5-7</a>. The fact that not only Judah but also Moses, as well as the kings of the Jews and Israelites, and many of the people too, married wives from gentile nations 
is clear from the historical sections of the Word; and one should not doubt that those wives accepted their statutes, judgements, and laws and were acknowledged as sojourners.

`Ut audire illos, et doluerunt viri, et exarsit illis valde' quod significet quod in malo essent contra velim Ecclesiae apud antiquos, constat a significatione `dolere et exardescere valde' quod hic 
sit in malo esse; quod contra verum Ecclesiae apud antiquos sequitur, quia contra Shechemum filium Hamoris, per quem {1} quot significetur verum apud antiquos, supra n. 4430, 4431 dictum est Quod 
in malo fuerint, patet ab illis quae sequuntur, quod nempe `locuti sint in fraude,' vers. 13, et dein postquam Shechemus e Hamor' condescendebant ad verba illorum, occiderent illos, vers. 26-29 inde 
est quod per `dolere' hic et `exardescere valde' significetur quo in malo essent; apparet sicut zelus fuerit, quia cubuit cum sorore eorum, secundum verba quae mox sequuntur, `quia stultitiam fecit 
in Israele ad cubandum cum filia Jacobi, et ita non fiet' (o)et in fine capitis, `dixerunt, An sicut meretricem faciet sororem nostram?' vers. 31; sed non fuit zelus, zelus enim nusquam dari potest 
apud aliquem qui est in malo, sed solum apud illum qui in bono, nam zelus in se bonum habet, n. 4164; [2] religiosum quidem {2} quod apud posteritatem illorum, in se bonum habuit, nam ejus {3} 
omnia et singula repraesentabant caelestia et spiritualia quae sunt regni Domini', sed quoad illos qui in illo erant, nihil boni habuit, in externis enim solum fuerunt absque internis, ut supra ostensum; 
se habet hoc sicut religiosum illius gentis in quo etiam hodie sunt; agnoscunt Mosen et Prophetas, ita Verbum; hoc sanctum in se est, sed quoad illos non sanctum est, nam in singulis ibi semet 
spectant, et sic mundanum, immo terrestre faciunt Verbum, nam quod inibi aliquid caeleste sit {4}, non sciunt, ne quidem curant; qui in tali statu sunt, non possunt in bono esse cum in suo religioso, 
sed in malo, nam nihil caeleste influit, hoc enim apud se exstinguunt.  [3] Secundum legem in Antiqua Ecclesia etiam notam fuit quod qui compressit virginem, dotem daret et acciperet illam 
in uxorem, juxta haec apud Mosen,           Si persuaserit vir virgini, quae non desponsata, et      cubat cum ea, dote dotabit eam sibi in uxorem; si renuendo      renuit pater ejus dare eam illi, 
argentum pendet, quantum      dos virginum, Exod. xxii 15, 16 [A.V. 16, 17]: </p>
<p>et alibi,           Si invenerit vir puellam virginem, quae non desponsata      est, et apprehenderit illam, ac cubuerit 
cum illa, et      deprehensi fuerint, dabit vir qui cubuit cum ea, patri      puellae quinquaginta argenti, et erit illi in uxorem, pro      quod compresserit illam; et non poterit repudiare illam  
    omnibus diebus suis, Deut. xxii 28, 29; </p>
<p>quod eadem haec lex nota fuerit antiquis, patet manifeste a Shechemi verbis ad puellae patrem et fratres,           Dixit Shechem ad patrem ejus et 
ad fratres ejus,      Inveniam gratiam in oculis vestris, et quod dicitis ad me,      dabo; multiplicate super me valde dotem et donum, et dabo      quemadmodum dicetis ad me, et detis mihi puellam 
ad      mulierem, vers. 11, 12; </p>
<p>et quia Shechemus legem illam complere voluit, et fratres Dinae consenserunt, si fieret sicut illi, circumcidendo omnem masculum, secundum verba quae sequuntur,  
         Verumtamen in hoc consentiemus vobis, si sitis sicut      nos, ad circumcidendum vobis omnem masculum, et dabimus      filias nostras vobis, et filias vestras accipiemus nobis, et      habitabimus 
cum vobis, et erimus in populum unum, vers. 15,      16; </p>
<p>inde patet quod non ex lege egerint, ita non ex bono, sed contra legem, proinde ex malo.  [4] Ex lege quidem fuit quod non conjugia inirent 
cum gentibus, de qua apud Mosen,           Ne accipias de filiabus illarum filiis tuis, et      scortentur filia earum post deos eorum, et scortari faciant      filios tuos post deo eorum, 
Exod. xxxiv 16: </p>
<p>et alibi,           Non affinitatem contrahes cum gentibus, filiam tuam non      dabis filio illius, et filiam illius non accipies filio tuo: </p>
<p>     ideo quo seducturus sit filium 
tuum a post Me, ut serviant      diis aliis, Deut. vii 3, 4; </p>
<p>sed haec lex lata est de gentibus idololatris, ne per conjugia ad cultum idololatricum deflecterent {5} a cultu vere repraesentativo, nam 
cur idololatrae facti sunt, non amplius repraesentare potuerunt caelesti et spiritualia regni Domini, sed opposita qualia sunt infernalia, quippe ab inferno (o)tunc evocabant quendam diabolum quem 
colebant, e cui repraesentativa Divina applicabant; quapropter dicitur {6}, ne scortarentur post deos illorum; (m)tum ob causam quia per `gentes significabantur mala et falsa, cum quibus bona et vera 
quae illi repraesentabant, non commiscerentur, (o)proinde non diabolica et infernali cum caelestibus et spiritualibus, n. 3024 f.(n)  Sed nusquam vetitum fui matrimonia contrahere cum gentibus quae 
acceptarunt cultum eorum et {7} qui postquam circumcisi essent, agnoscebant Jehovam; illo vocabant peregrinos peregrinantes cum illis, de quibus ita apud Mosen,           Si peregrinabitur tecum 
peregrinus, et voluerit facere      Pascha Jehovae, circumcidetur ei omnis masculus, et tunc      accedet a faciendum illud, et erit sicut incola terrae:...      lex una erit incola et peregrino 
qui peregrinatur in medio      vestrum, Exod. xii 48, 49; </p>
<p>et alibi,           Quando peregrinatus fuerit vobiscum peregrinus, faciet      Pascha Jehovae, juxta statutum Paschae, et juxta statuta  
    ejus, sic faciet statutum unum erit vobis tam peregrino quam      indigenae terrae, Num. ix 14; {8} quod dicti (o)sint peregrini peregrinantes in medio (c)illorum (o)et cum illis, erat quia 
`peregrinari' significabat instrui, ac ita `peregrinus' illos qui in `statutis et' doctrinalibus instrui se passi sunt; quod peregrinari et peregrinus id significent, videatur n. 1463, 2025, 3672 
{9}: apud eundem,           Quod si peregrinatus fuerit vobiscum peregrinus,            qui fecerit ignitum odoris quietationis Jehovae, quemadmodum      facitis, sic faciet: quantum ad contionem, 
statutum unum      vobis et peregrino peregrinanti, statutum aeternitatis in      generationes vestras: quales vos talis peregrinus coram      Jehovah; lex una, et judicium unum erit vobis et peregrino  
    peregrinanti vobiscum, Num. xv 14-16: </p>
<p>{10} tum alibi,           Sicut indigena ex vobis, erit vobis peregrinus      peregrinans vobiscum, Lev. xix 34           Judicium unum erit vobis, 
quale peregrino tale      indigenae erit, Lev. xxiv 22. [6] Quod hoc statutum non modo Jacobo et filiis ejus, sed etiam Shechemo et Hamori notum fuerit, patet a verbis illorum; nam statuta, judicia 
et leges quae genti Israeliticae et Judaicae data sunt, non fuerunt nova, sed talia quae fuerunt prius in {11} Antiqua Ecclesia, et in {11} Altera Antiqua quae (o)Hebraea ab Ebero dicta fuit, ut 
passim ostensum est; quod inde lex illa nota fuerit, patet a verbis filiorum Jacobi,           Dixerunt filii Jacobi ad Hamorem et Shechemum, Non      possumus facere verbum hoc, dare sororem nostram 
viro cui      praeputium, quia opprobrium hoc nobis; verumtamen in hoc      consentiemus vobis, si sitis sicut nos, ad circumcidendum      vobis omnem masculum, et dabimus filias nostras vobis, 
et      filias vestras accipiemus nobis, et habitabimus cum vobis,  et erimus in populum unum, vers. 14-16; </p>
<p>et a verbis Hamoris et Shechemi, quod non modo consenserint, sed etiam quod circumcidi 
fecerint se et omnem masculum urbis suae, vers. 18-24: [7] inde patet quod Shechemus talis factus qualis peregrinus, de qua in lege, et sic quod filiam Jacobi potuerit in mulierem accipere; ita {12} 
quod occiderint illos, fuerit factum nefandum; quod etiam testificatus Jacob ante mortem suam, Gen. xlix 5-7.  Quod non modo Jehudah, sed etiam Moses, tum reges Judaeorum et Israelitarum, ut et plures 
ex populo, duxerint uxores a gentibus, ex historicis Verbi constat; quae quin receperint statuta, judicia et leges eorum, et pro peregrinis agnitae fuerint, non dubitandum.      @1 quos$
