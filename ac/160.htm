<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第160节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>160.</strong>创世记2:24 因此，人要离开父母与妻子连合，二人成为一个肉体。<br />“离开父母”，表离开内在，因为孕育并产生外在的是人的内在；“与妻子联合”，表内在进入外在中；“成为一个肉体”，表内在与外在同在肉体中。因为之前，内在与外在是灵，现在它们已成为肉体。属天、属灵的生命就这样与人的自我结合，好似成了一体。</p>

Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother and cling to his wife, and they will become one flesh.<br />Leaving father and mother is leaving the inner being behind, as it is the inner being that conceives and gives birth to the outer being. To cling to one's wife is to have an inner being within our outer being. That they are to be one flesh means that the two coexist there. Prior to this time the inner being was spirit, as was the outer being through its connection with the inner. Now, however, they become flesh.<br />By this means, heavenly, spiritual life was linked so closely with the sense of independence that they seemed to form a unit. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 160</b></p><p><b>160.</b>
Verse 24. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh. To "leave father and mother" is to recede from the internal man, for it is 
the internal which conceives and brings forth the external; to "cleave unto his wife" is that the internal may be in the external; to "be one flesh" that they are there together; and because before, 
the internal man, and the external from the internal were spirit, but now they have become flesh. Thus was celestial and spiritual life adjoined to the Own, that they might be as one. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 160</b></p><p><b>160.</b>
Verse 24 Therefore a man (vir) will leave his father and his mother and will cling to his wife, and they will be one flesh. </p>
<p>'Leaving father and mother' is leaving the internal man, for the internal 
is that which conceives and gives birth to the external. 'Clinging to his wife' is in order that the internal man may be within the external. 'Being one flesh' means that they are there together. Previously 
the internal man, and the external man deriving from the internal, were spirit, but now they have become flesh. In this way celestial and spiritual life was joined on to the proprium in order 
that they might seemingly be one.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 160</b>
</p><b>160.</b>
Vers. 24.  Propterea relinquet vir patrem suum et matrem suam, et adhaerebit uxori suae, et erunt in carnem unam. 'Relinquere patrem et matrem' est internum hominem, nam internus est qui concipit et 
parit externum: 'adhaerere uxori' est ut internus sit in externo; 'in unam carnem' quod ibi simul sint; et quia prius fuit internus, et externus ab interno, spiritus, nunc autem facti sunt caro. Ita 
caelestis et spiritualis vita adjuncta fuit proprio ut sicut unum essent. </p>
