<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9272节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9272.</strong>“六年你要耕种你的地”表示第一个状态，就是当教会成员在信之真理和良善上接受教导之时。这从“六年”和“耕种地”的含义清楚可知：“六年”是指正在重生之人的第一个状态，如下文所述（<a href="9274.htm">9274</a>节）；“耕种地”是指当信之真理和良善的种子被植入的时候。“耕种地”具有这种含义的原因是，田间的一切事物，所种的，所产的，都表示诸如总体上属于教会，具体地属于一个教会成员，也就是通过从主所获得的信之真理和仁之良善而重生之人的那类事物。这就是为何在圣言中，“田地”和“土地”表示教会中那些接受信之真理和良善，如同田地接受种子的人，因此也是为何在圣言中，经上多次提及“田”、“种”、“播种”、“庄稼”、“出产”、“五谷”、“小麦”和由它们所制成的“饼”，以及涉及田地的其它一切事物。<br />凡不了解天堂状态是怎么回事的人，必以为诸如圣言中所提到的这些事物不过是隐喻和对比。但它们是真实的对应。因为当天使谈论主通过信之真理和仁之良善使一个人重生时，在下面的灵人界同时会出现田地、庄稼、休耕地，以及收割。它们出现的原因是它们的对应关系。凡了解这一点的人也能明白，这类事物在世上也是照对应关系而被造的；因为整个自然界，也就是天空与日月星辰，大地及其三个王国的对象，皆对应于诸如存在于灵界中的那类事物（<a href="2993.htm">2993</a>，<a href="5116.htm">5116</a>，<a href="5377.htm">5377</a>节），以至于自然界就是代表主国度的一个舞台（参看<a href="3483.htm">3483</a>节），自然界的一切事物由此获得自己的存在（<a href="2987.htm">2987</a>，<a href="2989.htm">2989</a>-<a href="2991.htm">2991</a>，<a href="3002.htm">3002</a>，<a href="8211.htm">8211</a>节）。由此明显可知为何属于田地的事物，也就是田间所种的和从田里所收割的，都表示教会的事物，无论总体还是具体。就连圣言中所用到的对比也来自相对应的事物（参看<a href="3579.htm">3579</a>，<a href="8989.htm">8989</a>节）。<br />“耕种土地或田地”表示教导并学习属于教会的信之真理和良善，“出产”表示由此产生的真理之良善，这一点从圣言中的许多经文可以看出来，如以赛亚书：<br />因你忘记救你的神，所以，你栽上佳美的树秧子，在地里插上异样的栽子。在你使栽子生长的日子，使种子开花的早晨。但在拥有的日子，收成将要成堆；悲伤却是绝望的。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛17.10.htm">17:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛17.11.htm">11</a>）<br />此处提到了诸如地里生长的那类事物；但它们明显表示教会的神圣事物；即“栽上佳美的树秧子”表示诸如取悦情感的那类事物；“在地里面插上异样的栽子”表示教导不纯正的真理。<br />耶利米书：<br />耶和华对犹大和耶路撒冷人如此说，要开垦你们的荒地，不要撒种在荆棘中！你们当自行割礼归耶和华，将你们心的包皮除掉。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.3.htm">4:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.4.htm">4</a>）<br />“撒种在荆棘中”表示教导并学习真理，但它们却被“世上的思虑，钱财的迷惑，和私欲”窒息，结不出果实，正如主在马可福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/可4.7.htm">4:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可4.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可4.19.htm">19</a>）中所教导的。这就是为何经上说他们要“自行割礼归耶和华，将他们心的包皮除掉”，也就是说，他们要从窒息信之真理和良善，使它们结不出果实的那类事物中洁净出来。这就是“割礼”的含义（参看<a href="2039.htm">2039</a>，<a href="2056.htm">2056</a>，<a href="2632.htm">2632</a>，<a href="3412.htm">3412</a>，<a href="3413.htm">3413</a>，<a href="4462.htm">4462</a>，<a href="7045.htm">7045</a>节）。耶利米书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶12.13.htm">12:13</a>）中“种的麦子，收的是荆棘”所表相同。<br />弥迦书：<br />我击打你，因你的罪使你荒凉，都厌倦了。你必撒种，却不得收割；踹橄榄，却不得油抹你；踹葡萄汁，却不得酒喝。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥6.13.htm">6:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥6.15.htm">15</a>）<br />“撒种不得收割”表示在信之真理上接受教导，却没有进一步的效果；“踹橄榄不得油抹自己”表示在生活的良善上接受教导，却没有过一种良善的生活；“踹葡萄汁不得酒喝”表示在来自良善的真理上接受教导，却没有把它们变成他们自己的。这些话表示教会或天堂的那类事物，这一点从前文明显看出来，即：他们因自己的罪而要以这种方式被荒废。因为一个邪恶的罪人虽接受教导，却只是将它存在记忆知识当中，在追求名声、地位和财富时就取出来，因而服务一个邪恶的功用和目的。因此，他所学到的信之真理和良善丧失了天堂的生命，成了死的，最终致死。<br />以赛亚书：<br />你们在各水边撒种、放出牛驴蹄的有福了。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛32.20.htm">32:20</a>）<br />“在各水边撒种”表示在各种能用于功用或有用服务的真理上接受教导；“放出牛驴蹄”表示在外在良善和真理上接受教导。同一先知书：<br />雅各要使那些到来的人扎根，以色列要发芽开花，地面必充满出产。你的教师却不再被迫逃离，你眼必看见你的教师。你的耳必听见后边有话说，这就是路，要行在其间。耶和华必给你撒在地里的种子和地所出的粮降雨；它必肥美丰盛。到那日，你的牲畜必在宽阔的草场吃草。耕地的牛和驴必吃洁净的饲料。在耶和华包扎祂百姓的伤口、医治祂民所击打伤痕的日子，月光必像日光，日光必加七倍，像七日的光一样。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛27.6.htm">27:6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.20.htm">30:20</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.26.htm">26</a>）<br />当经上说耶和华给人们撒在地里的种子和地所出产的粮降雨；他们的牲畜必在宽阔的草场吃草；耕地的牛和驴必吃洁净的饲料；月光必像日光，日光必加七倍时，所表示的是诸如与教会有关的那类事物。这对凡思想这个问题的人来说，是显而易见的。而且它们表示在信之真理和良善上接受教导，因为经上说：“你眼必看见你的教师。你的耳必听见后边有话说，这就是路，要行在其间。”“教师”是指那些给予教导的人，“他们要行在其间的路”是指教义的真理和生活的良善。不过，每句话的具体含义从“雨”、“种子”、“出产”、“地”、“牲畜”、“宽阔的草场”、“耕地的牛和驴”、“它们所必吃的洁净饲料”，以及“月光和日光”、“七倍”、“七日”的含义清楚看出来。由于它们表示诸如与教会有关的那类事物，也就是教义和生活的事物，故可推知，这一切将在“耶和华包扎祂百姓的伤口、医治祂民所击打伤痕的日子”发生；因为“百姓的伤口”是指由于教师的不诚实、恶欲和其它原因而逐渐蔓延的教义上的虚假；“击打伤痕”是指由此而来的生活上的邪恶。<br />由于以色列人和犹太人当中的一切事物都是天上神性事物的代表，所以田地及其出产，还有葡萄园、橄榄园、所有耕地，以及畜群和牛，另外大山小山、山谷、河流，并出现在他们眼前的其它一切事物都是如此。也正因如此，当他们遵守并执行律例和典章时，他们就照着圣言各处所作的应许而富有这些世俗事物，例如在摩西五经：<br />你们若遵行我的律例，谨守我的诫命，实行它们，我就按季节降雨给你们，叫地生出土产，田野的树木结果子。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.3.htm">26:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.4.htm">4</a>）<br />撒迦利亚书：<br />葡萄树必结果子，地土必有出产，天也必降甘露。你们从前在列族中怎样成为可咒诅的；照样你们必成为有福的。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚8.12.htm">8:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚8.13.htm">13</a>）<br />当他们拜别神时，他们就会遭遇相反的事，因为这时他们不再代表天上的神性事物，而是代表地狱恶魔似的事物；因此，这地不再肥沃多产，而是耗尽、荒废，正如摩西五经中的这些话：<br />你们若去事奉敬拜别神。耶和华的怒气要向你们发作，就使天闭塞不下雨，地也不出土产。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申11.16.htm">11:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申11.17.htm">17</a>）<br />申命记：<br />耶书仑渐渐肥胖，就踢跳离弃神。他们献祭给鬼魔，给他们素不认识的神。在我怒中有火烧起，直烧到最低的阴间，把地和地的出产，尽都吞灭。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.15.htm">32:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.17.htm">17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.22.htm">22</a>）<br />这一切表明“在地里撒种”和“地的出产”表示什么，以及它们从哪里获得这种含义；还表明这些事物在以下经文中表示什么：<br />耶和华使旷野变为水池，叫旱地变为水泉。祂使饥饿的人住在那里，好种田地，栽葡萄园，得享出产的果实。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗107.35.htm">107:35</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗107.37.htm">37</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />愿万民都称赞你！地已经出了土产；神要赐福与我们。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗67.5.htm">67:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗67.7.htm">7</a>）<br />申命记：<br />耶和华使祂百姓乘驾地的高处，得吃田间的土产；又使他们从磐石中咂蜜，从坚石中吸油。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.13.htm">32:13</a>）</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9272</b></p><p><b>9272.</b>
Six years thou shalt sow thy land. That this signifies the first state, when the man of the church is being instructed in the truths and goods of faith, is evident from the signification of "six years," 
as being the first state of the man who is being regenerated (of which below, n. 9274); and from the signification of "sowing the land," as being when the truths and goods of faith are being implanted. 
That this is signified by "sowing the land" is because all things of the field, of seeding, and of its produce, signify such things as are of the church in general, and as are of the man of the 
church in particular, who is a man that has been regenerated through the truth of faith and the good of charity from the Lord. Hence it is that "field" and "ground" in the Word signify those in the church 
who receive the truths and goods of faith, as a field receives seeds. Wherefore also in the Word mention is often made of a "field," of "seed," of "sowing," of "harvest," of "produce," of "grain" 
and "wheat," and of "bread" from these, as well as of all other things that belong to a field. [2] He who does not know how the case is with the state of heaven, believes no otherwise than that these 
expressions in the Word are mere metaphors and comparisons. But they are real correspondences. For when the angels discourse about the regeneration of man by the Lord through the truths of faith and 
the goods of charity, then below in the world of spirits there appear fields, crops, fallow lands, and also harvests; and this by reason of their correspondence. He who knows this can also know that 
such things in the world have been created according to correspondences; for universal nature (that is, the sky with the sun, moon, and stars, and the earth with the objects of its three kingdoms) corresponds 
to such things as are in the spiritual world (n. 2993, 5116, 5377). (That in this way nature is a theater representative of the Lord's kingdom, see n. 3483; and that from this all things in the 
natural world have their subsistence, n. 2987, 2989-2991, 3002, 8211.) From all this it is evident why the things belonging to a field, that is, which are sown in a field, and are reaped from a field, 
signify such things as are of the church in general and in particular. (That even the comparisons used in the Word are from things which correspond, see n. 3579, 8989.) [3] That "sowing the land," 
that is, a "field," denotes to teach and learn the truths and goods of faith which are of the church; and that the "produce" denotes the goods of truth therefrom, may be seen from many passages in the 
Word; as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, therefore shall thou plant plants of delights; but with the shoot of a strange one thou shalt set it: in the day thou 
shalt cause thy plant to grow, and in the morning thy seed to blossom: the harvest shall be a heap in the day of possession; but the grief is desperate (Isa. 17:10, 11); </p>
<p>here such things are mentioned 
as grow on the earth; yet it is evident that holy things of the church are meant by them; namely, by "planting plants of delights," such things as are favorable to the affections; and by "setting the 
land with a shoot of a strange one," to teach truths not genuine. [4] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Thus said Jehovah to the man of Judah and to Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns. 
Circumcise yourselves to Jehovah, and take away the foreskins of your heart (Jer. 4:3-4). That "to sow among thorns" denotes to teach and learn truths, but which are choked and rendered unfruitful 
by the cares of the world, the deceitfulness of riches, and concupiscence, the Lord teaches in Mark 4:7, 18, 19. Wherefore it is said, that they should "circumcise themselves to Jehovah, and take away 
the foreskins of their heart," that is, that they should purify themselves from such things as choke the truths and goods of faith, and render them unfruitful (that this is the meaning of "circumcising" 
see n. 2039, 2056, 2632, 3412, 3413, 4462, 7045). The like is signified in Jeremiah by "sowing wheat and reaping thorns" (Jer. 12:13). [5] In Micah: </p>
<p>     I have been wearied with smiting thee, 
with laying thee waste because of thy sins. Thou shalt sow, but shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olive, but shalt not anoint thee with oil; and the must, but shalt not drink the wine (Micah 6:13, 
15); </p>
<p>"sowing and not reaping" denotes to be instructed in the truths of faith, but without profit; "treading the olive, but not anointing oneself" denotes to be instructed about the good of life, but 
still not to live in it; "treading the must, but not drinking the wine" denotes to be instructed about the truths which are from good, but still not to appropriate them to oneself. That such things 
of the church or of heaven are signified by these words is plain from those which precede, namely, that they were to be laid waste in this manner "because of their sins;" for the wicked and sinful man 
receives instruction, but merely stores it up among memory-knowledges, which he brings forth from his memory in order to get reputation, fame, honors, and wealth, thus to serve an evil use and end. From 
this the truths and the goods in which he has been instructed lose the life of heaven, and become dead, and finally deadly. [6] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send 
forth the foot of the ox and the ass (Isa. 32:20); </p>
<p>"to sow beside all waters" denotes to be instructed in all kinds of truths which are for use; "to send forth the foot of the ox and the ass" denotes 
to be instructed in external goods and truths. Again: </p>
<p>     Jacob shall cause those who are to come to take root; Israel shall blossom and bloom, so that the faces of the world shall be filled with 
produce; thy teachers shall not any more be forced to flee away, and thine eyes shall look unto thy teachers; and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, go ye in it. Then 
shall Jehovah give the rain of thy seed, wherewith thou shalt sow the land; and bread of the produce of the earth, and it shall be fat and rich; in that day shall thy cattle feed in a broad meadow; and 
the oxen and the asses that till the land shall eat clean provender. The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, 
in the day that Jehovah shall bind up the breach of His people, and shall heal the wound of their stroke (Isa. 27:6; 30:20-26). [7] To everyone who reflects it is plainly evident that by its being said 
that Jehovah should "give the rain of the seed wherewith they should sow the land, and bread of the produce of the earth;" that "their cattle should feed in a broad meadow;" that "the oxen and the 
asses that till the land should eat clean provender;" that "the light of the moon should be as the light of the sun, and the light of sun should be sevenfold," there are signified such things as are 
of the church, and also that they signify instruction in the truths and goods of faith; because it is said, "thine eyes shall look unto thy teachers, and thine ears shall hear a word, saying, This is 
the way, go ye in it." For "teachers" denote those who instruct, and "the way in which they should go" denotes the truth of doctrine and the good of life. But the specific signification of each expression 
is clear from the signification of "rain," of "seed," of "produce," of "land," of "cattle," of a "broad meadow," of "oxen and asses tilling the land," and of "clean provender which they should eat;" 
also from the signification of "the light of the moon and of the sun," likewise of "sevenfold," and of "seven days." And as by these expressions are signified such things as are of the church, that 
is, such as are of doctrine and of life, it follows that this will come to pass in the day that Jehovah shall "bind up the breach of His people, and heal the wound of their stroke;" for "the breach 
of the people" denotes the falsity of doctrine which gradually creeps in from the badness of the teachers, from concupiscences, and from other causes; "the wound of the stroke" denoting the consequent 
evil of life. [8] As with the Israelitish and Jewish people all things were representative of things heavenly and Divine, so also were the fields, and their produce; likewise the vineyards, oliveyards, 
and all plantings; as also herds and oxen, and the mountains, hills, valleys, rivers, and all other things that were presented before their senses. From this also it was that they were enriched with 
such things when they kept and did the statutes and judgments, according to the promises in the Word throughout, as in these passages: </p>
<p>     If ye shall walk in My statutes, and keep My commandments, 
and do them, I will give your rains in their season, and the land shall yield her produce, and the tree of the field shall yield its fruit (Lev. 26:3, 4).      The vine shall give its fruit, and the 
earth shall give its produce, and the heavens shall give their dew; whence it shall come to pass, that as ye have been a curse among the nations, ye shall be a blessing (Zech. 8:12, 13). [9] The contrary 
befell them when they worshiped other gods, for then they no longer represented heavenly and Divine things, but infernal and diabolical ones. Wherefore then there was no longer fruitfulness nor 
produce; but consumption and wasting, according to these words in Moses: </p>
<p>     If ye serve other gods, the anger of Jehovah shall be kindled against you, and He shall shut up the heaven, that there 
be no rain, and the land yield not her produce (Deut. 11:16, 17).      When Jeshurun waxed fat, he kicked, and forsook God. They sacrifice unto demons, to gods whom they knew not; wherefore a fire is 
kindled in Mine anger, and it shall burn even to the lowest hell, and shall consume the land and its produce (Deut. 32:15, 17, 22). [10] From all this it is now evident what is signified by "sowing 
the land," and by its "produce," and also whence these have their signification. It is also evident what is signified by these things in the following passages: </p>
<p>     Jehovah maketh a wilderness into 
a pool of waters, and a land of drought into watersprings. There He maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may sow fields, and plant vineyards, and get them fruit of produce (Ps. 107:35-37).      Let 
all the peoples confess Thee. The earth shall yield its produce; God shall bless us (Ps. 67:5-7).      Jehovah maketh His people ride on the high places of the earth, and feedeth them with the produce 
of the fields; He maketh him to suck honey out of the cliff of the rock, and oil out of the stone of the rock (Deut. 32:13). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9272</b></p><p><b>9272.</b>
'[And] six years you shall sow [your] land' means the first state, when a member of the Church receives instruction in the truths and forms of the good of faith. This is clear from the meaning of 'six 
years' as the first state of a person who is being regenerated, dealt with below in <a href="9274.htm">9274</a>; and from the meaning of 'sowing the land' as a time when the seeds of the truth and good of faith are implanted. 
The reason why 'sowing the land' has this meaning is that everything involving the field, what is sown in it, and what it produces means such things as belong in general to the Church and in particular 
to a member of the Church, that is, to a person regenerated by means of the truth of faith and the good of charity received from the Lord. This is why 'the field' and 'the ground' in the Word mean 
those within the Church who receive the truths and forms of the good of faith, just as the field receives seeds, and therefore also why the field, seed, sowing, harvest, produce, grain and wheat, 
bread made from them, and everything else involving the field are mentioned many times in the Word.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Anyone unacquainted with the true nature of the heavenly state inevitably supposes that those 
things as they are mentioned in the Word are no more than metaphorical ways of speaking and comparisons; yet they are true correspondences. For when angels talk about the Lord's regeneration of a person 
by means of the truths of faith and forms of the good of charity, there appear at the same time in the world of spirits below them fields, crops, fallow land, and also harvests. The reason for their 
appearance is their correspondence. Anyone acquainted with this is also able to see that such things have been created in the world in accordance with correspondences; for the whole natural order 
- that is, all the sky together with the sun, moon, and stars, and the earth together with every object in its three kingdoms - corresponds to such things as exist in the spiritual world, <a href="2993.htm">2993</a>, <a href="5116.htm">5116</a>, <a href="5377.htm">5377</a>, so that the natural order is a theatre which is representative of the Lord's kingdom, <a href="3483.htm">3483</a>, from which all things in the natural world derive their existence, <a href="2987.htm">2987</a>, <a href="2989.htm">2989</a>-<a href="2991.htm">2991</a>, <a href="3002.htm">3002</a>, <a href="8211.htm">8211</a>. All this 
shows how it comes about that what belongs to the field - that is, what is sown in the field and what is harvested from the field - means things of the Church in general and in particular. Even comparisons 
made in the Word involve the use of things that are correspondential, see <a href="3579.htm">3579</a>, <a href="8989.htm">8989</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The fact that 'sowing the land (or the field)' means teaching and learning about the truths and forms 
of the good of faith which belong to the Church, and the fact that 'the produce' means resulting forms of the good of truth may be seen from many places in the Word, as in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Because you 
have forgotten the God of your salvation, therefore you will plant pleasant plants;<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> but you will plant out the land<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> with the vine-sprig of the foreigner. In the day you will cause your plant to grow, 
and in the morning your seed to flourish. The harvest will be a heap on the day of possession; but the grief will be desperate. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2017:10,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 17:10, 11</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here such things as grow on earth are mentioned, 
but holy things of the Church are plainly meant by them. That is to say, 'planting pleasant plants' means such things as delight the affections, and 'planting out the land with the vine-sprig of the 
foreigner' teaching unauthentic truths.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said Jehovah to the man of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and do not sow among thorns. Circumcise yourselves to 
Jehovah, and remove the foreskins of your heart. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%204:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 4:3, 4</a>.

<p>'Sowing among thorns' means teaching and learning truths which however are choked and rendered unfruitful by 'the cares of this world, 
the deceitfulness of riches, and cravings', as the Lord teaches in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%204:7,%2018,%2019&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 4:7, 18, 19</a>. This is why it says that they were 'to circumcise themselves to Jehovah and to remove the foreskins of their heart', 
that is, to purify themselves from the kinds of things that choke the truths and forms of the good of faith and render them unfruitful. For this meaning of 'circumcising', see <a href="2039.htm">2039</a>, <a href="2056.htm">2056</a>, <a href="2632.htm">2632</a>, <a href="3412.htm">3412</a>,

Sowing wheat and reaping thorns in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jeremiah%2012:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jeremiah 12:13</a> has a similar meaning.  </p>

 In Micah,  </p>
<blockquote>
I am tired of striking you, of laying you waste because of your sins. You will sow 
but not reap; you will tread olives but not anoint yourself with oil, and tread the new wine but not drink wine. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Micah%206:13,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Micah 6:13, 15</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Sowing and not reaping' stands for receiving instruction in the truths 
of faith but to no further effect. 'Treading olives but not anointing themselves with oil' stands for receiving instruction in goodness of life but still failing to lead a good life. 'Treading the 
new wine but not drinking wine' stands for receiving instruction in truths flowing from good but still not making them their own. That such aspects of the Church or of heaven are meant by these words 
is evident from those that come before them, namely the words stating that they were laid waste in that way because of their sins. For one who is wicked and a sinner receives instruction but he does 
no more than store it away among items of knowledge in his memory which he draws on in his quest for reputation, position, and riches, thus which he uses to serve an evil end and purpose. As a consequence 
the truths and forms of good which the person has learned about forfeit the life of heaven, becoming dead and eventually lethal.  </p>

 In Isaiah,  </p>

Blessed are you who sow beside all waters,

</blockquote>
<p>'Sowing beside all waters' stands for receiving instruction in any truths whatever that can be put to useful service, 'sending forth the 
foot of the ox and the ass' for receiving instruction in external kinds of goodness and truth. In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
Those who are to come Jacob will cause to take root. Israel will blossom and flower, 
so that the face of the earth may be filled with produce. Your teachers will not be compelled to flee away any more; and your eyes will be looking at your teachers, and your ears will hear the word 
behind you, saying, This is the way, go in it. Then Jehovah will give rain for your seed with which you will sow the land, and bread of the produce of the earth; and there will be fatness and wealthiness. 
On that day they will feed your livestock in a broad grassland. And oxen and asses tilling the land will eat pure fodder. The light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light 
of the sun will be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, on the day when Jehovah will bind up the hurt<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> of His people, and will heal the wound of their stroke. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2027:6;%2030:20-26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 27:6; 30:20-26</a>.

<p><b>[7]</b>
 When it 
says that Jehovah would give rain for the seed with which [the people] would sow the land, and bread of the produce of the earth, that they would feed their livestock in a broad grassland, that oxen and 
asses tilling the land would eat pure fodder, that the light of the moon would be as the light of the sun, and that the latter would be sevenfold, such things as have to do with the Church are meant. 
This is plainly evident to anyone who gives thought to the matter, as is the fact that receiving instruction in the truths and forms of the good of faith is meant. For it says, 'Your eyes will be looking 
at your teachers, and your ears will hear the word, saying, This is the way, go in it', and 'teachers' are those who give instruction, while 'the way' in which they were to go is the truth that 
doctrine teaches and the good in which life consists. But the specific meaning of each individual statement is evident from the meaning of 'rain', 'seed', 'produce', 'the land', 'livestock', 'a broad 
grassland', 'oxen and asses tilling the land', and 'the fodder they were to eat', as well as from the meaning of 'the light of the moon and of the sun', and also of 'sevenfold' and 'seven days'. And 
since such things as have to do with the Church are meant by them, that is, matters of doctrine and of life, it follows that this will take place 'on the day when Jehovah will bind up the hurt of His 
people, and will heal the wound of their stroke' - 'the hurt of the people' being falsity in doctrine that gradually creeps in owing to the dishonesty of teachers, to evil cravings, and to other causes, 
and 'the wound of their stroke' being consequent evil in life.  </p>

<p><b>[8]</b>
 Since everything among the Israelite and Jewish people was representative of heavenly and Divine realities, so too were fields 
and their produce, also vineyards, olive groves, and all cultivated areas, as well as herds and oxen, and in addition mountains, hills, valleys, rivers, and all else that met their eye. In this also 
lay the reason why, whenever they kept and carried out statutes and judgements, they were made rich in those earthly things, according to the promises made in various places in the Word, for example in 
Moses,  </p>
<p>If you walk in My statutes and keep My commandments and do them, I will give you rain in its season, and the land will give its produce, and the tree of the field will give its fruit. Lev. 
26:3, <a href="4.htm">4</a>.  </p>
<p>And in Zechariah,  </p>
<blockquote>
The vine will give its fruit, and the land will give its produce, and the heavens will give their dew. Consequently it will happen, that just as you were a curse among 
the nations, you will be a blessing. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%208:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 8:12, 13</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 But the opposite happened to them when they worshipped other gods, for then they no longer represented heavenly and Divine realities but 
hellish and devilish ones; and for this reason the land was no longer fertile or productive, but was consumed and laid waste, in accordance with the following in Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
If you serve other gods 
Jehovah's anger will be aroused against you; He will close heaven so that there is no rain and the land does not give its produce. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2011:16,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 11:16, 17</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And in the same author,  </p>
<blockquote>
When Jeshurun became 
fat he kicked, and forsook God. They sacrifice to demons, to gods they have not known. Therefore a fire has flared up in My anger, and will burn right down to the lowest hell, and will consume the land 
and its produce. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2032:15,%2017,%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 32:15, 17, 22</a>.

 All this shows what it is that 'sowing the land' and 'its produce' means, and also where they derive that meaning from, as well as showing what it is 
they mean in the following places: In David,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah turns a wilderness into a pool of water, and parched land into streams of water. He makes the hungry dwell there, that they may sow fields and 
plant vineyards, and yield a fruitful harvest.<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20107:35-37&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 107:35-37</a>.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>In Moses, 
 </p>

Jehovah causes His people to ride on the heights of the land, and He feeds [them] with the produce of the fields; He causes them to suck honey out of the stony crag and oil out of the stony rock.

`[Et] sex annis seres terram [tuam]': quod significet statum primum cum homo Ecclesiae instruitur in veris et bonis fidei, constat ex significatione `sex annorum' quod sit status hominis qui regeneratur 
primus, de qua infra n. 9274, et ex significatione `serere terram' quod sit cum inseminantur vera et bona fidei; quod `serere terram' sit illud, est quia omnia quae sunt agri, sementis, et ejus proventus, 
significant talia quae sunt Ecclesiae in communi, et quae sunt hominis Ecclesiae in particulari, qui est homo regeneratus per verum fidei et bonum charitatis a Domino; inde est quod {1}ager 
et humus in Verbo significent illos in Ecclesia qui {2}recipiunt vera et bona fidei, sicut ager semina; quapropter etiam in Verbo pluries memoratur ager, semen, sementis, messis, proventus, frumentum, 
et triticum, et inde panis, {3}praeter reliqua quae sunt agri. 2 Qui non scit quomodo se habet cum statu caeli, non aliter credit quam quod (x)illa in Verbo solum locutiones (x)metaphoricae ac comparationes 
(x)sint, sed sunt reales correspondentiae; quando enim angelis est sermo de regeneratione hominis a Domino per vera fidei et bona charitatis, tunc infra in mundo spirituum apparent agri, sata, 
novalia, et quoque messes, et hoc ex causa quia correspondent; qui hoc scit etiam scire potest quod talia in mundo secundum correspondentias creata sint, nam universa natura, hoc est, caelum cum sole, 
luna, astris, et tellus cum subjectis trium (t)regnorum suorum, correspondent talibus quae in mundo spirituali sunt, n. 2993, 5116, 5377, et quod sic natura sit theatrum (x)repraesentativum regni Domini, 
n. 3483, et quod inde subsistant omnia quae in mundo naturali {4}, n. 2987, 2989-(x)2991, 3002, 8211; ex his patet unde est quod illa quae sunt agri, hoc est, quae seruntur in agro et metuntur 
ex agro, significent talia quae sunt Ecclesiae in communi et in particulari; quod etiam comparationes {5}in Verbo sint ex illis quae (x)correspondent, videatur n. 3579, 8989. 3 Quod `serere terram' seu 
`agrum' sit docere et discere vera et bona fidei quae Ecclesiae, et quod `proventus' sint bona veri inde, constare potest ex pluribus locis in Verbo, ut apud Esaiam, Quia oblita es Dei salutis tuae, 
propterea plantabis plantas jucundarum; sed palmite extranei conseres eam; in die plantam tuam crescere facies, et mane semen tuum (x)efflorescere, acervus messis in die possessionis; at dolor desperatus, 
xvii [10,] 11; hic talia quae super tellure crescunt memorantur; quod tamen sancta Ecclesiae per illa intelligantur, patet, nempe per `plantare plantas jucundarum' talia quae favent affectionibus, 
et per `palmite extranei conserere terram' docere vera non genuina: [4] apud Jeremiam, 	Sic dixit Jehovah viro Jehudae et Hierosolymae, Novate vobis novale, neque serite inter spinas; circumcidite 
vos (x)Jehovae, et removete praeputia cordis vestri, iv 3, 4; </p>
<p>quod `serere inter spinas' sit docere et discere vera, sed quae `curae mundi, fraus divitiarum, et concupiscentia (x)suffocant et infrugifera 
reddunt,' docet Dominus apud Marcum iv 7, 18, 19; quapropter dicitur quod `circumciderent se Jehovae et removerent praeputia cordis,' hoc est, quod (x)purificarent se a talibus quae vera (o)et 
bona fidei suffocant et infrugifera reddunt; quod circumcidere id sit, videatur n. 2039, 2056, 2632, 3412, 3413, 4462, 7045; simile per serere tritica et metere spinas significatur apud Jeremiam xii 
13: apud 5 Micham, 	Ego defatigatus sum percutiendo te, devastando propter peccata tua; tu seres sed non metes; tu calcabis olivam, sed non unges te oleo; et mustum, sed non bibes vinum, vi 13, 15; </p>
<p>`serere 
et non metere' pro instrui in veris fidei sed absque profectu, `calcare olivam sed non ungere se oleo' pro instrui de bono vitae sed usque non vivere in illo, `calcare mustum sed non bibere vinum' 
pro instrui de veris quae ex bono sed usque non appropriare illa sibi; quod talia Ecclesiae seu caeli per illa significentur, patet ex illis quae praecedunt, quod (o)nempe (t)ita devastarentur propter 
peccata eorum, nam impius et peccator instructionem recipit sed modo inter scientifica reponit quae e memoria depromit ad aucupandum famam, honores, et opes, ita ad serviendum usui et fini malo; 
inde vera et bona quibus (o)homo instructus est amittunt vitam caeli, et fiunt mortua, ac demum mortifera: [6] apud Esaiam, 	Beati vos serentes juxta {6} omnes aquas, emittentes pedem bovis et asini, 
xxxii 20; </p>
<p>`serere juxta {7} omnes aquas' est instrui veris quibuscumque quae ad usum, `emittere pedem bovis et asini' est {8} instrui in bonis et veris externis: apud eundem, 	Venturos radicabit Jacobus, 
efflorescet et florebit Israel, ita ut impleantur facies orbis proventu: non avolare cogentur amplius doctores tui, et erunt oculi tui respicientes doctores tuos, et aures tuae audient verbum 
a post te, dicendo, Haec via, ite in ea; tunc (o)Jehovah dabit pluviam seminis tui quo conseres terram, et panem proventus terrae, et erit pingue et opulentum; pascent pecora tua in die illo prato lato; 
et boves et asini (x)laborantes terram farraginem meram comedent: erit lux lunae sicut lux solis, et lux solis erit septupla, sicut lux septem dierum, in die quo obligabit Jehovah fracturam populi 
Sui, et vulnus plagae ejus sanabit, xxvii 6, [xxx] 20-26; </p>
<p>[7] quod Jehovah daret pluviam seminis quo consereret terram, et panem proventus terrae, quod pascerent pecora prato lato, quod boves et asini 
laborantes terram farraginem meram comederent, quod lux lunae esset sicut lux solis, et haec septupla, significent talia quae sunt Ecclesiae {9}, patet manifeste cuivis qui expendit; tum quod significent 
instructionem in veris et bonis fidei {10}; nam dicitur, `erunt oculi tui respicientes doctores tuos, et aures tuae audient verbum, dicendo, Haec via, ite in ea,' `doctores' enim sunt qui instruunt, 
et `via in (x)qua irent' est verum doctrinae et bonum vitae; quid autem singula in specie significant, patet a significatione `pluviae,' `seminis,' `proventus,' `terrae,' `pecorum,' `prati lati,' 
`boum et asinorum laborantium terram,' `farraginis quam comedent {11}'; tum (x)ex significatione `lucis lunae et solis,' ut et {12} `septupli' (c)et `septem {13} dierum'; et quia talia quae (o)sunt Ecclesiae, 
hoc est, quae doctrinae et vitae, per illa significantur, sequitur quod hoc fiet `in die quo Jehovah obligabit fracturam populi Sui, et sanabit vulnus plagae ejus'; `fractura populi' est falsum 
doctrinae ex improbitate doctorum, ex concupiscentiis, et ex aliis causis sensim irrepens, `vulnus plagae' est malum vitae inde. 	[8] Quia apud populum Israeliticum et Judaicum omnia erant repraesentativa 
caelestium et Divinorum, etiam erant agri et eorum proventus, tum vineae, oliveta, et omnes plantationes, ut et armenta et boves, praeter etiam montes, colles, valles, fluvii, et reliqua quae 
sensibus eorum obvia fuerunt; inde erat quod etiam talibus locupletati fuerint cum statuta et judicia custodiverunt et fecerunt, secundum promissiones passim in Verbo, ut apud Moschen, 	Si in statutis 
Meis ambulaveritis, et praecepta Mea custodiveritis et feceritis illa, dabo pluvias vestras in tempore suo, et dabit terra proventum suum, et arbor agri dabit fructum suum, Lev. xxvi [3,] 4: </p>
<p>et apud 
Sachariam, 	Vitis dabit fructum suum, et terra dabit proventum suum, et caeli dabunt rorem suum; unde fiet, quemadmodum fuistis maledictio inter gentes, eritis benedictio, viii 12, 13. 	[9] Contrarium 
{14} evenit quando colebant alios deos, nam tunc non amplius repraesentabant caelestia et Divina sed infernalia et diabolica; quapropter tunc non amplius fuit fertilitas, nec proventus, sed consumptio 
et vastatio, secundum haec apud Moschen, 	Si serviatis diis aliis, exardescet ira Jehovae contra vos; concludet caelum ut non sit pluvia, et terra non det proventum suum, Deut. xi [16,] 17: </p>
<p>et 
apud eundem, 	Cum pinguis factus est (x)Jeschurun, recalcitravit, et deseruit Deum; sacrificant daemonibus, diis quos non noverunt; quare ignis accensus est in ira Mea, et ardebit usque ad infernum 
infimum, ac consumet terram et proventum ejus, Deut. xxxii 15, 17, 22 {15}. 	[10] Ex his nunc patet quid significatur per `serere terram' et per `proventum ejus,' tum quoque unde id (o)quod significent; 
patet etiam quid per illa significatur in sequentibus his locis: apud Davidem, 	Jehovah ponit desertum in stagnum aquarum, et terram siccitatis in exitus aquarum; facit habitare ibi famelicos, 
ut serant agros, et plantent vineas, et faciant fructum proventus, Ps. cvii [35-]37: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Confitebuntur Te populi omnes; terra dabit proventum suum; benedicet nobis Deus, Ps. (x)lxvii 6-8 [A.V. 
5-7]: </p>
<p>apud Moschen, 	Jehovah facit equitare populum Suum super excelsis terrae, et cibat proventu agrorum; sugere facit eum mel e rupe petrae, et oleum ex saxo petrae, Deut. xxxii (x)13. @1 ager
