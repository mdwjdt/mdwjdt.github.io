<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9232节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9232.</strong> 一些灵人出现在头顶上，我听见有声音从那里来，就像雷鸣；因为他们的声音，好像闪电过后从云中发出的雷声。我以为这是一大群灵人，他们学会了利用他们的嗓音发出这样的声音。但与我同在的一些更简单的灵人却嘲笑他们，这令我大为惊讶。他们嘲笑的原因很快就明白了，原来这些像打雷一样隆隆作响的灵人并不多，而是极少，并且还很小，像孩子一样；此外，他们以前就用这种声音吓坏了其他灵人，不过并未造成任何伤害。</p>

ON THE SPIRITS OF THE MOON Certain spirits appeared overhead, and voices were heard thence like thunders; for their voices made a loud thundering noise just like thundering from the clouds after flashes 
of lightning. I supposed that it was a vast multitude of spirits who had learned to utter their voice with such a sound. The more simple spirits who were with me laughed at them, at which I was much 
surprised. The reason why they laughed at them was soon disclosed, and it was that the spirits who thundered were not many, but few; and also were little men, like children; and moreover, had previously 
excited terror by such sounds, and yet could not do any harm. </p>

MOON SPIRITS  </p>
<p>Some spirits appeared overhead, and I heard voices coming from there which sounded like thunder; for their voices boomed just like thunder coming from the clouds after flashes of lightning. 
I assumed that it was a huge number of spirits who had been taught to use their voices to emit such a sound. But some quite ordinary spirits who were present with me laughed at them, which amazed 
me very much. The reason for their laughter soon became clear. It was that the spirits who boomed like thunder were not many but few, and also that they were small, like children, and that although 
they had previously terrified these other spirits by making such sounds they had been unable to do any harm whatever.  </p>

</p><b>9232.</b>
Quidam spiritus apparebant supra caput et inde auditae sunt voces sicut tonitrua, nam non aliter tonabant voces eorum quam sicut e nubibus tonitrua post fulmina; autumabam quod esset ingens multitudo 
spirituum qui edocti vocem edere cum tali sonitu.  Spiritus simpliciores qui apud me erant illos irridebant quod valde miratus sum; causa irrisionis mox detegebatur, quae erat quod spiritus qui tonabant 
non multi essent sed pauci, et quoque parvi sicut pueri; et quod illi prius per {1}tales sonitus terrorem incusserint, et tamen prorsus nihil damni possent inferre. @1 tales sonitus altered to talem sonitum$ </p>
