<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第765节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>765.</strong>到目前为止，所阐述的主题一直是被称为“挪亚”的该教会成员:首先阐述了其涉及觉知之物的试探，也就是信之真理（7:6-10），然后阐述了其涉及意愿之物的试探，这些试探涉及仁爱的善行（7:11，12）。试探的目的是为了使该教会或新教会成员可以在上古教会行将灭亡期间通过它们重生。如前所述，这个被称为“挪亚”的教会具有和上古教会完全不同的品质，也就是说，它是属灵的教会，其性质是这样：人通过信的教义事物而重生。一旦这些被植入进去，良知就被注入他里面，以防他做出违背信之真理与良善的事来。他以此被赋予掌管良知的仁爱，他通过这仁爱开始行事。由此明显可知何为属灵之人，即他并不是相信无仁之信能救赎之人，而是使仁成为信之本质要素，并由此行事之人。使这样一个人或教会诞生才是所着眼的目的，因而接下来阐述这个教会本身。现在阐述的是这个教会，这一点从重述同一件事明显看出来。因为此处经上说：“正当那日，挪亚和他三个儿子闪、含、雅弗，并挪亚的妻子和三个儿媳，都进入方舟”，而这和前面第7节几乎一样，尽管第7节说的是：“挪亚就同他的儿子、妻子、儿媳，都进入方舟。”不过，由于现在阐述的是教会，所以提到了儿子的名字“闪、含、雅弗”。当以名字被提及时，他们表教会成员，而当被称为儿子，没有加上名字时，他们表信之真理。另外，8-9节经文论及牲畜和飞鸟都进入方舟，这在14-16节经文中再次重复，不过此处会有符合和适用于这个教会的某些变化。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]765.</strong> Up to this point, the subject has been the trials of the people in the church who were called Noah. First to be discussed were their trials involving the contents of their intellect, which are the true ideas that compose faith (verses 6-10). Next were their trials involving the contents of their will, which have to do with the good impulses of charity (verses 11, 12). The purpose of these struggles was to bring about the rebirth of the individual belonging to the church — in other words, the birth of a new church — when the earliest church ended.<br />This church, as already explained [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_765/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_371" target=_top>371</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_765/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_597" target=_top>597</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_765/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_607" target=_top>607</a>], had a different character than the earliest church. It was a spiritual religion, which is one whose members are reborn by means of the doctrinal precepts of faith. When these precepts have taken root, they allow for the introduction of conscience, which prevents a person from acting contrary to the truth and goodness that faith embraces. Such people can then receive the gift of charity, which governs their conscience, and this becomes their guide to behavior. These details illustrate the nature of the spiritual person — not one who considers faith without charity to be saving but one who views charity as the essential quality of faith and takes it as a basis for action.<br />The emergence of such an individual, or such a church, was the end in view, and so attention now turns to this church.<br />We can also see that this church is now the subject from the repetition of what seems to be the same idea. The present verse says, "On that very day Noah entered the ark, as did Shem and Ham, and Japheth, Noah's sons, and Noah's wife and his sons' three wives with them." Verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_765/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_7" target=_top>7</a> above makes a similar statement, but in these words: "And Noah entered the ark, as did his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him." Because the church is now the subject, the sons are mentioned by name — Shem, Ham, and Japheth. When they are called by name, they symbolize the people of the church. When on the other hand they are referred to as sons, without names, they symbolize the true concepts of faith.<br />In addition, what was said at verses <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_765/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_8-9" target=_top>8-9</a> about the entry of the animals and birds into the ark is repeated in verses <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_765/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_14-15" target=_top>14-15</a>, and 16, with variations here to suit and adapt it to the church. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 765</b></p><p><b>765.</b>
Thus far the temptation of the man of the church called "Noah" has been treated of: first, his temptation as to things of the understanding, which are truths of faith (verses 6 to 10); and then his temptation 
as to things of the will, which have regard to the goods of charity (verses 11, 12). The end or purpose of the temptations was that a man of the church or a new church might be born again by 
their means; seeing that the Most Ancient Church had perished. This church called "Noah" was as before said of a different character from that of the Most Ancient Church; that is to say, it was spiritual, 
the characteristic of which is that man is born again by means of doctrinal matters of faith, after the implantation of which a conscience is insinuated into him, lest he should act against the 
truth and good of faith; and in this way he is endowed with charity, which governs the conscience from which he is thus beginning to act. From this it is evident what a spiritual man is; that he is not 
one who believes faith without charity to be saving, but one who makes charity the essential of faith, and acts from it. That such a man or such a church might arise, was the end in view, and therefore 
that church itself is now treated of. That the church is now treated of is evident also from the repetition as it were of the same matter; for it is said here: "in the selfsame day entered Noah, and 
Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;" and likewise above in verse 7, but in these words: "and Noah went in, and his 
sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark." But now, because the church is treated of, the sons are named, "Shem, Ham, and Japheth" who when thus named signify the man of the church, 
but when called "sons" without names, signify truths of faith. Besides, that which was said in verses 8 and 9 about the beasts and the fowls that went into the ark is repeated again, in verses 14 
to 16, but here with a difference accordant with and applicable to the subject of the church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 765</b></p><p><b>765.</b>
Up to now the subject has been the temptation of the member of the Church called Noah. Verses 6-10 have first of all dealt with his temptation involving things of the understanding, which are truths 
of faith. After that verses 11, 12, have dealt with his temptation involving things of the will, which have in view the good deeds of charity. The purpose of the temptations was that the member of the 
Church, that is, that the new Church, might be born again by means of them, during the time that the Most Ancient Church was dying out. As stated already, this Church was quite different in disposition 
from the Most Ancient Church; that is to say, it is a spiritual Church, whose nature is such that this individual is born again by means of doctrinal matters concerning faith. Once these have been 
implanted, conscience is instilled into him to prevent his doing things contrary to the truth and good of faith. In this way charity is conferred on him which then governs his conscience, from which he 
accordingly starts to act. From these considerations it becomes clear what a spiritual man is; he is not one who imagines that faith without charity saves, but one who makes charity the essential element 
of faith, and acts from it. To bring such a person or Church into being was the end in view, and this is why this Church itself is dealt with next. The fact that it is the Church which is dealt 
with next becomes clear also from the repetition so to speak of the same point, for it is said here that, 'On that very day Noah went in, and Shem and Ham and Japheth, Noah's sons, and Noah's wife, and 
the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark', which is similar to verse 7 above, though that verse reads, 'And Noah went in, and his sons and his wife, and his sons' wives with him into the 
ark'. Since the subject is now the Church however, the sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth are mentioned by name; and when so mentioned by name they mean the member of the Church. But when they are called 'sons 
without the addition of their names they mean truths of faith. In addition, what has been stated already in verses 8, 9, about beasts and birds going into the ark is repeated once again in verses 14-16, 
but with certain changes that are here fitting and applicable to the Church. </p>

Huc usque actum de tentatione hominis Ecclesiae Noahus dicti, et quidem primum de tentatione ejus quoad intellectualia, quae sunt vera fidei, a vers. 6 ad 10, et dein de tentatione ejus quoad voluntaria, 
quae spectant bona charitatis, vers. 11, 12. Finis tentationum fuit ut inde renasceretur homo Ecclesiae, seu Ecclesia nova, pereunte Antiquissima: haec Ecclesia, ut prius dictum, diversae indolis 
fuit ab Antiquissima, nempe spiritualis; quae talis est ut homo per doctrinalia fidei renascatur; quae cum implantata sunt, tunc insinuatur ei conscientia, ne contra verum et bonum fidei agat; et sic 
donatur charitate, quae conscientiam ejus regit, ex qua sic agere incipit; ex quibus constare potest quid spiritualis homo, non qui putat fidem absque charitate salvare, sed qui essentiale fidei facit 
charitatem, et inde agit: ut talis homo seu talis Ecclesia existeret, fuit finis; quare nunc de ipsa hac Ecclesia agitur: quod nunc de Ecclesia agatur, constare etiam potest a repetitione quasi ejusdem 
rei, dicitur enim hic, 'In ipso hoc die intravit Noah, et Shem, et Ham, et Japheth, filii Noahi, et uxor Noahi, et tres uxores filiorum ejus cum illis in arcam,' supra vers. 7 similiter, sed his 
verbis, 'et intravit Noah, et fila ejus et uxor ejus, et uxores filiorum ejus cum illo in arcam,' sed quia nunc de Ecclesia agitur, nominantur filii Shem, Ham et Japheth, qui cum nominantur, significant 
hominem Ecclesiae; at cum vocantur 'filii' absque nominibus, significant vera fidei: praeterea repetuntur iterum quae prius dicta sunt vers. 8, 9 de bestiis et avibus, quod intrarint in arcam, vers. 
14-16; sed cum varietate conveniente et applicabili hic ad Ecclesiam. </p>
