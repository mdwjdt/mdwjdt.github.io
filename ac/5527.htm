<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5527节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5527.</strong>“你们也可以在这地到处作买卖”表这样真理将从良善而结实，都会提供某种功用和利益。这从“作买卖”的含义清楚可知，“作买卖”是指为自己获得对良善与真理的认知，因而获得教会的真理，并传播它们（参看<a href="4453.htm">4453</a>节）。那些拥有这类真理的人被称为“商人或买卖人”（<a href="2967.htm">2967</a>节）。因此，“在这地到处做买卖”是指收集这类真理，无论它们在哪里。由此可知“在这地到处做买卖”也表示使真理从良善结实。因为一旦联结通过居间层，即“便雅悯”实现，也就是说，一旦外在人，即“雅各的十个儿子”与内在人，即“约瑟”联结（此处论述的是就是这种联结），或也可说，一旦人重生，那么良善就会不断使真理结实。<br />处于良善的人拥有看到源于总体真理的具体真理，并看到它们的连续序列的能力。在来世后期，就是世俗和肉体事物不再给他们蒙上阴影的时候，情况尤其如此。我被允许通过大量经历知道这种能力就在良善里面，或说良善就自带这种能力。我曾看见在世为人时没大有这种能力，却过着仁爱生活的灵人被提入天堂的社群；然后便拥有类似那里天使的聪明和智慧；甚至只知道这智慧和聪明就在他们里面。因为他们所处的良善赋予他们接受从他们所在的天使社群流入他们的一切事物的能力。这种能力，因而这种结实就存在于良善里面。但是，在他们里面通过良善结实的真理不再依旧是真理，而是被他们融入生活，然后变成功用。因此，“在这地到处做买卖”也表示一切真理都将转向或提供某种功用和利益。</p>

And ye shall go about trading in the land. That this signifies that in this way truths will be made fruitful from good, and will all turn to use and profit, is evident from the signification of "trading," 
as being to procure for one's self the knowledges of good and truth, thus the truths of the church, and to communicate them (see n. 4453). They who have such things are called "traders" (n. 2967); 
wherefore "to go about trading in the land" is to seek diligently for such things wherever they are. From this it follows that "to go about trading in the land" signifies also to make truths fruitful 
from good; for when conjunction is effected through the intermediate which is "Benjamin," that is, the conjunction of the external man represented by the ten sons of Jacob, with the internal which 
is "Joseph" (which conjunction is here treated of), or what is the same, when the man has been regenerated, then truths are continually made fruitful from good. For he who is in good is in the capacity 
of clearly seeing the truths which flow from general truths, and this in a continual series; and still more afterward in the other life, where worldly and bodily things do not cast a shade. That this 
capacity is in good has been given me to know by much experience. I have seen spirits who had not been very clear sighted when they lived as men in the world, yet had led a life of charity, taken up 
into heavenly societies; and then they were in similar intelligence and wisdom with the angels there, and even did not know but that this wisdom and intelligence were in them. For through the good in 
which they had been they were in the capacity of receiving all influx from the angelic societies in which they were. Such a capacity, and hence such fruitfulness, is in good. But the truths which are 
made fruitful in them by good do not remain truths, but are committed by them to life, and then become uses; and therefore by "going about trading in the land" is signified also that they all will turn 
to use and profit. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5527</b></p><p><b>5527.</b>
'And you will wander through the land, trading' means that truths from good will thereby be made fruitful and will all afford some useful purpose and lead to some form of gain. This is clear from the 
meaning of 'trading' as acquiring for oneself cognitions of good and truth, and so truths known to the Church, and communicating the same, dealt with in <a href="4453.htm">4453</a>; and those who possess such truths are called 
'traders', <a href="2967.htm">2967</a>. Consequently 'going through the land, trading' is gathering such truths, wherever they are. From this it follows that 'going through the land, trading' also means the fruitfulness 
of truths from good. For once the joining together through the intermediary, which is 'Benjamin', has been accomplished, that is to say, once the external man, which is 'the ten sons of Jacob', has 
been joined to the internal, which is 'Joseph' - which joining together is dealt with here - or what amounts to the same, once a person has been regenerated, good is constantly making truths fruitful. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
For someone who is governed by good possesses the ability to see particular truths that derive from general ones, and to see them in a continuing sequence. This is more especially the case at 
a later stage in the next life when worldly and bodily matters cease to cast a shadow over them. I have been allowed to know from considerable experience that good brings this ability with it. Such experience 
has included spirits who had possessed not so much of that ability when they lived as people in the world but who had nevertheless led charitable lives. I have seen those spirits raised up into 
heavenly communities, where they have then possessed intelligence and wisdom akin to that of the angels there; indeed these knew no other than that such intelligence and wisdom existed within those 
spirits. For the good which had governed the lives they had led gave them the ability to receive everything that flowed into them from the angelic communities in which they were present. This kind of 
ability exists within good and so therefore does that kind of fruitfulness. But the truths which with them are made fruitful by good do not remain as truths; these people make them matters of life, in 
which case they come to be assigned to some useful purpose. Therefore 'wandering through the land, trading' also means that all truths will afford some useful purpose and lead to some form of gain. </p>

`Et terram negotiando pervagabimini {1}': quod significet quod ita fructificabuntur vera ex bono, et omnia cedent usui et lucro, constat ex significatione `negotiari' quod sit cognitiones boni et veri, 
ita vera Ecclesiae, sibi comparare, et illa communicare, de qua n. 4453; `negotiatores' vocantur qui talia habent, n. 2967; quare `negotiando pervagari terram' est conquirere talia ubicumque sunt; 
inde sequitur quod etiam per `negotiando pervagari terram' significetur fructificare vera ex bono; cum enim conjunctio facta est per medium quod `Benjamin', nempe externi hominis quod `decem filii Jacobi', 
cum interno quod Joseph, de qua conjunctione hic agitur, seu quod idem, cum homo regeneratus est, tunc vera continue fructificantur ex bono; [2] qui enim in bono est, in facultate est perspiciendi 
vera quae a communibus fluunt, et hoc in serie continua; et magis dein in altera vita ubi mundana et corporea non inumbrant; quod in bono illa facultas sit, per plurem experientiam scire datum est; 
spiritus qui non ita perspicaces fuerunt cum vixerunt homines in mundo, at usque charitatis vitam egerant {2}, illos vidi in societates angelicas elevatos, et tunc in simili intelligentia et sapientia 
cum angelis ibi, immo non aliter sciebant quam quod intelligentia et sapientia illa in iis essent {3}; erant enim per bonum in quo fuerant, in facultate recipiendi omnem influxum a societatibus angelicis 
in quibus erant; talis facultas inest  bono, et inde talis fructificatio.  Ast vera quae apud illos fructificantur a bono, non manent vera, sed ab illis mandantur vitae, et tunc fiunt usus; quapropter 
per `negotiando pervagabimini terram'  etiam significatur quod omnia cedent usui et lucro. @1 pervagamini I$ @2 egerunt$ @3 illis esset$ </p>
