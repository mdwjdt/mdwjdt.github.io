<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>288.</strong>对于“人”表上古教会之人，亦即属天之人，这在前面已作了说明。唯独主是人，凭着他，属天之人成了他的样式，得成为人，这在前面也作了说明。在此基础上，教会的每个成员被称为一个“人”，没有例外，也没有分别。最后，“人”之名被用于一切在身形上显为人的生命，以将他与动物分别出来。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]288.</strong> The meaning of the human as the individual of the earliest church, or the heavenly person, has already been demonstrated [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_288/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_277" target=_top>277</a>]. In fact, it was shown that the Lord alone is human [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_288/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_49" target=_top>49</a>] and that heavenly people acquire their humanity from him, because they are his likeness [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_288/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_50" target=_top>50-51</a>]. This is how all who belonged to the church came to be called human, no matter who they were or what they were like. In the end, all that was required was that they appear physically human, so that they could be distinguished from animals. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 288</b></p><p><b>288.</b>
That by "man" is meant the man of the Most Ancient Church, or the celestial man, was previously shown; and at the same time it was also shown that the Lord alone is Man, and that from Him every celestial 
man is man, because in His likeness. Hence every member of the church, without exception or distinction, was called a "man" and at length this name was applied to anyone who in body appeared as a 
man, to distinguish him from beasts. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 288</b></p><p><b>288.</b>
That 'man' (homo) is used to mean the member (vir) of the Most Ancient Church, that is, celestial man, has been shown already indeed that the Lord alone was Man, and that from Him every celestial man 
was Man because he was His likeness. Consequently everyone who belonged to the Church, no matter who and without exception, was called man (homo). And in the end anyone who in body looked like a human 
being was called man to distinguish him from animals.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 288</b>
</p><b>288.</b>
Quod per 'hominem' intelligatur vir Antiquissimae Ecclesiae, seu caelestis homo, prius ostensum est; et quidem quod Dominus solus Homo, et quod ex Ipso omnis caelestis homo, quia similitudo Ipsius; 
inde vocatus 'homo' qui esset Ecclesiae, quicumque et qualiscumque; et tandem quisque qui corpore apparet ut homo, ad distinguendum eum a bestiis. </p>
