<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4850节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4850.</strong>“过了许多日子”表状态的变化。这从“许多日子”的含义清楚可知，“许多日子”是指状态的变化；因为“日子”或“时间”在内义上是指状态（参看<a href="23.htm">23</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="488.htm">488</a>，<a href="893.htm">893</a>，<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="3462.htm">3462</a>，<a href="3785.htm">3785</a>节），当论及天数或时间时，“许多”是指经历变化。所表示的是状态的变化，这一事实也可从接下来的细节明显看出来。经上之所以说“许多”，是因为状态的变化涉及真理方面的，“许多（或增多）”便论及真理（参看<a href="43.htm">43</a>，<a href="55.htm">55</a>，<a href="913.htm">913</a>，<a href="983.htm">983</a>，<a href="2846.htm">2846</a>，<a href="2847.htm">2847</a>节）。由于状态和状态的变化经常被提及，然而很少有人知道何为状态或状态的变化，所以最好解释一下。时间和时间的流逝，或空间和空间的扩展无法与人的内层，也就是他的情感和由此而来的思维联系在一起；因为这些内层既不在时间之内，也不在空间之内（尽管在世上的感官看来，它们似乎在时空之内），而是在对应于时间和空间的内层事物之内。我们只能把与它们相对应的这些内层事物称为状态，因为找不到其它词来描述与时间和空间相对应的事物。当人的心智或内心里的情感和由此而来的思维经历变化时，如当悲伤变为欢乐，或欢乐又变为悲伤，或不虔诚变为敬虔或虔诚等等时，就说内层的状态发生变化。这些变化被称为状态的变化，可归因于情感，并且只要思维由情感主导，也可归因于思维。但思维状态的变化在情感的变化中，就像细节在总体中，并且相对来说是变化。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4850</b></p><p><b>4850.</b>
And the days were multiplied. That this signifies a change of state, is evident from the signification of "days being multiplied," as being the changing of the states; for "day" or "time" in the internal 
sense is state (see n. 23, 487, 488, 893, 2788, 3462, 3785), and "being multiplied," when predicated of days or times, is being changed. That it is a change of state which is signified, is evident 
also from what follows. It is said "were multiplied," because a change of state is involved as to truths, for "multiplying" is predicated of truths (see n. 43, 55, 913, 983, 2846, 2847). As state and 
change of state are so often mentioned, and as few know what is meant, it will be well to explain. Time and the succession of time, or space and the extension of space, cannot be predicated of man's 
interiors, that is, of his affections and the thoughts therefrom; because these interiors are not in time nor in place-although to the senses in the world it appears as if they were-but are in interior 
things which correspond to time and place. These interior things which correspond we have to call states, because there is no other word by which these corresponding things can be expressed. The state 
of the interiors is said to be changed when the mind or heart is changed as to affections and consequent thoughts-as from sadness to joy, or from joy to sadness again; from impiety to piety or devotion; 
and so on. These changes are called changes of state, and are predicated of the affections, and of the thoughts also insofar as they are governed by the affections; but changes of state of the 
thoughts are in those of the affections like particulars in generals, and are relatively variations. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4850</b></p><p><b>4850.</b>
'The days were multiplied' means a change of state. This is clear from the meaning of 'the days being multiplied' as undergoing a change of state, for 'day' or a time in the internal sense means state, <a href="23.htm">23</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="488.htm">488</a>, <a href="893.htm">893</a>a, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="3462.htm">3462</a>, <a href="3785.htm">3785</a>, and 'being multiplied' when used in reference to days or times means undergoing a change. The fact that a change of state is the meaning is also evident from the 
details that follow. The expression 'to be multiplied' is used because it implies a change of state so far as truths are concerned; for 'to be multiplied' is used in reference to truths, <a href="43.htm">43</a>, <a href="55.htm">55</a>, <a href="913.htm">913</a>, 
<a href="983.htm">983</a>, <a href="2846.htm">2846</a>, <a href="2847.htm">2847</a>. Since the terms state and change of state are being used time and again, and yet few know what a state or a change of state is, a statement needs to be made about what these are. Neither 
time and the passage of time nor space and the extension of space can be associated with the interior aspects of the human being - that is to say, with his affections and his thoughts formed by 
these - because his affections and thoughts are not located in time and place, though to the senses in the world they do seem to be thus located. Rather, they are located in the interior things which 
correspond to time and place. The things which correspond to them cannot be called anything else than states, for no other term exists to describe the things that correspond to time and place. A change 
of state in interior things is said to take place when the affections and resulting thoughts in a person's mind or disposition (mens seu animus) undergo change, as when sadness turns to joy, or joy 
back to sadness, when ungodliness turns to godliness or devotion, and so on. These changes are called changes of state and are attributable to affections and, insofar as thoughts are governed by these, 
to thoughts also. But the changes of state which thoughts held within affections undergo are like those of individual parts within their general wholes, compared with which they are variations. </p>

`Multiplicati dies': quod significet status mutationem, constat ex significatione `multiplicari dies' quod sit mutari status; `dies' enim seu tempus in sensu interno est status, n. 23, 487, 488; 
893, 2788, 3462, 3785, et `multiplicari cum praedicatur de diebus seu temporibus est mutari; quod sit status mutatio quae significatur{1}, patet etiam a sequentibus; multiplicari dicitur quia involvit 
mutationem status quod vera, nam  {2}'multiplicari praedicatur de veris, n. 43, 55, 913, 983, 2846, 2847. Quia toties dicitur status et quoque mutatio status, et pauci sciunt quid status et mutatio 
ejus, dicendum quid sit: de interioribus hominis, nempe ejus affectionibus et inde cogitationibus non praedicari potest tempus et temporis processus nec spatium e spatii {3}extensio, quia non 
in tempore nec in loco sunt, tametsi apparet coram sensibus in mundo quod sint, sed {4}in interioribus sunt qua tempori et loco correspondent; haec quae correspondent non aliter vocari possunt quam 
status, non enim alia vox per quam {5}correspondentia illa exprimantur, datur; mutari interiorum status dicitur cum mutatur mens seu animus quoad affectiones et inde cogitationes sicut a tristi in 
laetum, a laeto iterum in triste, ab impio {6}ad pium aut devotum, et sic porro; mutationes hae vocantur status mutationes ac praedicantur de affectionibus et quatenus cogitationes ab his reguntur, 
etiam de cogitationibus; sed mutationes status cogitationum insunt illis sicut singularia communibus, et sunt variationes respective. @1 per quod multiplicati dies$ @2 multiplicatio$ @3 extensa$ @4
