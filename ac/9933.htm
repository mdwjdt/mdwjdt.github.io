<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9933节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9933.</strong>“要用一条蓝细带子将牌系住”表进入属天之爱的真理的流注。这从“蓝”的含义清楚可知，“蓝”是指属天之爱的真理，如下文所述。上面刻有“归耶和华为圣”的牌子被一条蓝细带子系住表示进入这真理的流注，因为它以这种方式挂在这带子上，并被系在它上面；“系”和“挂”在灵义上表示流入，因为在灵界，任何联结，无论它是哪一种，都通过流注实现。流注之所以进入源于“归耶和华为圣”所表示的主之神性人身的属天之爱的真理，是因为在属天之爱的真理所在的天堂气场，除了主的神性人身之外，没有什么神性之物能被感知到。<br />此处的情形如下：有三层天堂，它们通过良善的层级而彼此有别。属天之爱的良善，就是对主之爱的良善，在至内层天堂；属灵之爱的良善，就是对邻之仁的良善在第二层或中间天堂；来自属灵层和属天层的相爱的良善，就是信仰和顺从的良善，在第一或最低层天堂。每层天堂都有一个内在和一个外在。如前所述，在至内层天堂，内在是对主之爱的良善；那里的外在是属于为了良善而对良善之爱的相爱的良善。这良善就是“蓝细带子”所表示的属天之爱的真理的意思。在这种真理所在的气场中，掌权的是这一觉知：主之人身就是在众天堂的神自己。因此，一旦一位天使被提升到这个气场，他也进入这光中。这种觉知从主流入，因为主的神性人身构成天堂；这流注就是此处所表示的。“蓝”表示对真理的属天之爱，或也可说，属天之爱的真理（参看<a href="9466.htm">9466</a>，<a href="9687.htm">9687</a>，<a href="9833.htm">9833</a>节）。</p>

And thou shalt put it upon a thread of blue. That this signifies influx into the truth of celestial love, is evident from the signification of "blue," as being the truth of celestial love (of which below). 
Influx into this truth is signified by the plate on which was engraved "Holiness to Jehovah" being put upon a thread of blue, for in this way it hung from it and was bound to it, and in the spiritual 
sense by "being bound to," and "hanging," is signified to inflow, because all conjunction whatever is effected by means of influx. That the influx is into the truth of celestial love about the 
Lord's Divine Human, which is signified by "Holiness to Jehovah," is because in that sphere of heaven where is the truth of celestial love, no other Divine is perceived than the Divine Human of the Lord. 
 [2] For the case herein is as follows. There are three heavens, which have been distinguished from one another by means of the degrees of good. In the inmost heaven is the good of celestial love, 
which is the good of love to the Lord; in the second or middle heaven is the good of spiritual love, which is the good of charity toward the neighbor; in the first or ultimate heaven is the good of 
natural love, from spiritual and from celestial love, which is the good of faith and obedience. In each heaven there is an internal and an external. As just said, the internal in the inmost heaven is 
the good of love to the Lord, and the external there is the good of mutual love, which belongs to the love of good for the sake of good. This good is what is meant by the truth of celestial love, which 
is signified by "the thread of blue." In the sphere where is this truth, the Lord's Human is perceived as being the Divine Itself in the heavens, and therefore as soon as an angel is raised into this 
sphere, he comes into this light also. This perception flows in from the Lord, because the Divine Human of the Lord makes heaven. This is the influx which is here signified. (That "blue" denotes the 
celestial love of truth, or what is the same thing, the truth of celestial love, see n. 9466, 9687, 9833.) </p>

'And you shall place it on a cord of violet' means an influx into the truth of celestial love. This is clear from the meaning of 'violet' as the truth of celestial love, dealt with below. An influx into 
that truth is meant by the placing of the plate, on which 'Holiness to Jehovah' had been engraved, on a cord made from violet. For it thereby hung from the cord, having been attached to it, and being 
attached to and hanging from in the spiritual sense means flowing in, since any joining together in the spiritual world, whatever kind it may be, is accomplished through influx. The reason why the 
influx is into the truth of celestial love derived from the Lord's Divine Human, meant by 'Holiness to Jehovah', is that in that sphere of heaven where the truth of celestial love is, nothing Divine 
is perceived other than the Lord's Divine Human.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The situation in all this is that there are three heavens, which are separated from one another by their degrees of good. In the inmost heaven 
there is the good of celestial love, which is the good of love to the Lord; in the second or middle heaven there is the good of spiritual love, which is the good of charity towards the neighbour; and 
in the first or lowest heaven there is the good of natural love from the spiritual and from the celestial, which is the good of faith and obedience. In each heaven there is an internal part and an external. 
The internal in the inmost heaven consists in the good of love to the Lord, as stated above; and the external there consists in the good of mutual love, which is that of the love of good for its 
own sake. This good is what should be understood by the truth of celestial love, meant by 'a cord of violet'. In the sphere where this kind of truth exists the perception reigns that the Lord's Human 
is God Himself in the heavens. Therefore as soon as an angel is raised into that sphere he also passes into that light. Such perception flows in from the Lord since the Lord's Divine Human composes 
heaven; and this influx is what is meant here. For the meaning of 'violet' as the celestial love of truth, or what amounts to the same thing, the truth of celestial love, see <a href="9466.htm">9466</a>, <a href="9687.htm">9687</a>, <a href="9833.htm">9833</a>.  </p>

`Et pones eam super filo hyacinthini': quod significet influxum in verum amoris caelestis, constat ex significatione `hyacinthini' quod sit verum amoris caelestis, de qua sequitur; influxus in illud 
significatur per quod bractea illa, cui insculpta erat Sanctitas Jehovae, super filo ex hyacinthino posita fuerit, nam (d)sic pendebat ex eo, et alligata ei erat, et per `alligari et pendere' in spirituali 
sensu significatur influere, quoniam omnis conjunctio {1}in spirituali mundo, qualiscumque sit, fit per influxum. Quod influxus sit in verum amoris caelestis {2}de Divino Humano Domini, quod per 
Sanctitatem Jehovae {3} significatur, est quia in illa sphaera caeli, ubi verum amoris caelestis est, non aliud Divinum percipitur quam Divinum Humanum Domini; 2 nam cum hoc ita se habet: caeli sunt 
tres, qui distincti sunt inter se per gradus boni; in intimo caelo est bonum amoris caelestis, quod est bonum amoris in Dominum, in altero {4}seu medio caelo est bonum amoris spiritualis, quod est bonum 
charitatis erga proximum, in primo {5}seu ultimo caelo est bonum amoris naturalis a spirituali et a caelesti, quod est bonum fidei et oboedientiae; in unoquovis caelo est internum et externum; internum 
in caelo intimo est bonum amoris in Dominum, ut supra dictum est, et externum ibi est bonum amoris mutui, quod est amoris boni propter bonum; hoc bonum est quod intelligitur per verum amoris caelestis, 
quod per `filum hyacinthini' significatur; in ea sphaera, ubi hoc verum est, Humanum Domini, quod sit ipsum Divinum in caelis percipitur; {6}quapropter ut primum angelus in illam sphaeram {7} 
elevatur, etiam in illam lucem venit; influit illa perceptio ex Domino, quoniam {8}Divinum Humanum Domini facit caelum, {9} hic influxus est qui significatur. Quod `hyacinthinum' sit caelestis amor veri, 
seu quod idem {10}, verum amoris caelestis, videatur n. 9466, 9687, 9833. @1 ibi$ @2 , nempe Divini Humani$ @3 i, quae insculpta erat bracteae auri,$ @4 coelo quod medium$ @5 coelo, quod ultimum,$ @6
