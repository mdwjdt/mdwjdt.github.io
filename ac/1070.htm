And he drank some wine and became drunk and was uncovered in the middle of his tent.<br />And he drank wine means that they wanted to explore religious questions. And became drunk means that they consequently fell into error. And was uncovered in the middle of his tent symbolizes the resulting perversions; the middle of the tent is that which is the primary concern of one's faith. </p>

Verse 21. And he drank of the wine and was drunken; and he was uncovered in the midst of his tent. "And he drank of the wine" signifies that he desired to investigate the things which are of faith; "and 
was drunken" signifies that he thereby fell into errors; "and he was uncovered in the midst of his tent" signifies the consequent perverted things; the "midst of a tent" is the principal of faith. </p>

Verse 21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunk, and he was uncovered in the middle of his tent.  </p>
<p>'And he drank wine' means that he wished to probe into matters of faith. 'And he was drunk' means 
that he consequently sank into errors. 'And he was uncovered in the middle of his tent' means resulting perversities, 'the middle of the tent' being the chief thing of faith. </p>

Vers. 21.  Et bibit de vino, et inebriatus est, et discoopertus fuit in medio tentorii sui. 'Et bibit vinum' significat quod illa quae sunt fidei vellet investigare: 'et inebriatus est' significat quod 
inde in errores lapsus: 'et discoopertus fuit in medio tentorii sui' significat perversa inde; 'medium tentorii' est quod principale fidei. </p>
