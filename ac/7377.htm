But they are not in these loves who aspire to honors not for the sake of themselves, but for the sake of their country; and who aspire to wealth not for the sake of wealth, but for the sake of the necessaries 
of life, both for themselves and for their families, also for the sake of the good use on account of which the wealth delights them. With such persons honors and riches are means of imparting 
benefits.            EXODUS 8 </p>
<p>     1. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the pools, and cause frogs to 
come up upon the land of Egypt.      2. And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.      3. And the magicians of Egypt did so with 
their enchantments, and caused frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.      4. And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said, Supplicate ye unto Jehovah that He remove the frogs from me and from my 
people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to Jehovah.      5. And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Have thou honor over me, till when shall I supplicate for thee, and for thy servants, and 
for thy people, to cut off the frogs from thee, and from thy houses? Only in the river shall they be left.      6. And he said, Unto the morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word; that thou 
mayest know that there is none like Jehovah our God.      7. And the frogs shall be removed from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; only in the river shall they be 
left.      8. And Moses and Aaron went out from before Pharaoh; and Moses cried unto Jehovah upon the word of the frogs which He had laid on Pharaoh.      9. And Jehovah did according to the word 
of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields.      10. And they gathered them together in heaps and heaps; and the land stank.      11. And Pharaoh saw that 
there was breathing, and he made heavy his heart, and heard them not, as Jehovah had spoken.      12. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, 
and it shall become lice in all the land of Egypt.      13. And they did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the land, and there was louse on man and on beast; 
all the dust of the land became louse in all the land of Egypt.      14. And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, and they could not; and there was louse on man and on 
beast.      15. And the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God; and Pharaoh's heart was made firm, and he heard them not, as Jehovah had spoken.      16. And Jehovah said unto Moses, 
Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he goeth forth unto the waters; and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Let My people go, that they may serve Me.      17. For if thou let not 
My people go, behold I send against thee, and against thy servants, and against thy people, and into thy houses, the noisome fly; and the houses of the Egyptians shall be filled with the noisome fly, 
and also the land whereon they are.      18. And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, upon which My people stand, that no noisome fly be there; to the end that thou mayest know that I am Jehovah 
in the midst of the land.      19. And I will set redemption between My people and thy people; unto the morrow shall this sign be.      20. And Jehovah did so; and there came the grievous noisome 
fly into the house of Pharaoh, and into the house of his servants, and into all the land of Egypt; the land was destroyed from before the noisome fly.      21. And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, 
and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.      22. And Moses said, It is not meet to do so, for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Jehovah our God; lo, we shall sacrifice 
the abomination of the Egyptians unto their eyes, and will they not stone us?      23. We will go a way of three days into the wilderness, and will sacrifice to Jehovah our God, as He hath said unto 
us.      24. And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, and ye shall sacrifice to Jehovah your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away; supplicate for me.      25. And Moses said, Behold 
I go forth from thee, and I will supplicate unto Jehovah that He may remove the noisome fly from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow; only let not Pharaoh mock anymore in not 
letting the people go to sacrifice to Jehovah.      26. And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and he supplicated unto Jehovah.      27. And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; and He removed the 
noisome fly from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there was not one left.      28. And Pharaoh made heavy his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go. </p>

But people are not immersed in those kinds of love if they aspire to important positions not for selfish reasons but for the sake of their country, or if they aspire to wealth not for its own sake but 
the sake of having the necessities of life both for themselves and their dependents, and for the sake of the good use it is put to, which gives them pleasure in being wealthy. Important positions and 
wealth with these people are means to doing good. </p>

 Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Moschen, Dic ad Aharonem, Extende manum tuam baculo tuo, super flumina, super fluvios, et super stagna, et fac ascendere ranas super terram Aegypti. 	2.  Et extendit Aharon 
manum suam super aquas Aegypti, et ascendit rana, et obtexit terram Aegypti. 	3.  Et fecerunt ita magi Aegypti incantationibus suis, et ascendere fecerunt ranas super terram Aegypti. 	4.  Et vocavit 
Pharao Moschen et Aharonem, et dixit, Supplicate ad JEHOVAM, et removeat ranas a me, et a populo meo, et dimittam populum, et sacrificent JEHOVAE. 	5.  Et dixit Moscheh ad Pharaonem, Honorem habe 
super me, quousque supplicabo tibi, et servis tuis, et populo tuo, ad exscindendum ranas a te, et a domibus tuis; tantum in fluvio supererunt. 	6.  Et dixit, Ad crastinum; et dixit, Secundum verbum tuum, 
propterea ut scias quod nullus sicut JEHOVAH DEUS noster. 	7.  Et removebuntur ranae a te, et a domibus tuis, et a servis tuis, et a populo tuo; tantum in fluvio supererunt. 	8.  Et exivit Moscheh 
et Aharon a cum Pharaone, et clamavit Moscheh ad JEHOVAM super verbo ranarum quas imposuit Pharaoni. 	9.  Et fecit JEHOVAH secundum verbum Moschis; et mortuae sunt ranae e (x)domibus, ex atriis, 
et ex agris. 	10.  Et congregaverunt {1}illos acervis acervis; et putuit terra. 	@1 illas I$ 	11.  Et vidit Pharaoh quod facta respiratio, et aggravavit cor suum, et non audivit ad illos, quemadmodum 
locutus JEHOVAH. 	12.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Moschen, Dic ad Aharonem, Extende baculum tuum, et percute pulverem terrae, et erit in pediculos in omni terra Aegypti. 	13.  Et fecerunt ita, et extendit 
Aharon manum suam baculo suo, et percussit pulverem terrae, et fuit pediculus in homine et in bestia; omnis pulvis terrae factus est pediculus in tota terra Aegypti. 	14.  Et fecerunt ita magi incantationibus 
suis ad educendum pediculos, et non potuerunt; et fuit pediculus in homine et in bestia. 	15.  Et dixerunt magi ad Pharaonem, Digitus DEI hoc; et obfirmatum cor Pharaonis, et non audivit 
ad illos, quemadmodum locutus JEHOVAH. 	16.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Moschen, Surge mane in matutino, et consistas coram Pharaone, ecce egreditur ad aquas, et dicas ad illum, ita dicit JEHOVAH, Mitte populum 
Meum, et serviant Mihi. 	17.  Quia si haud tu dimittis populum Meum, ecce Ego immitto in te, et in servos tuos, et in populum tuum, et in domos tuas, volatile noxium; et implebuntur domus Aegyptiorum 
volatili noxio, et etiam terra super qua illa. 	18.  Et distinguam in die illo terram Goschen, super qua populus Meus stat, ut non esse ibi volatile noxium, propterea ut scias quod Ego JEHOVAH 
in medio terrae. 	19.  Et ponam redemptionem inter populum Meum et inter populum tuum; ad cras erit signum hoc. 	20.  Et fecit JEHOVAH ita, et venit volatile noxium (x) grave domum Pharaonis, et domum 
servorum illius, et in omnem terram Aegypti; perdebatur terra a coram volatili noxio. 	21.  Et vocavit Pharao Moschen et Aharonem, et dixit, Ite, sacrificate DEO vestro in terra. 	22.  Et dixit 
Moscheh, Non consultum facere ita, quia abominationem Aegyptiorum sacrificaremus JEHOVAE DEO nostro; ecce sacrificaremus abominationem Aegyptiorum ad oculos illorum, nonne lapidabunt nos? 	23.  Viam 
trium dierum ibimus in desertum, et sacrificabimus JEHOVAE DEO nostro, quemadmodum dixit ad nos. 	24.  Et dixit Pharao, Ego dimittam vos, et sacrificetis JEHOVAE DEO vestro in deserto, tantum elongando 
non elongetis vos ad eundum; supplicate pro me. 	25.  Et dixit Moscheh, Ecce ego egredior a cum te, et supplicabo ad JEHOVAM, et removeat volatile noxium a Pharaone, a servis illius, et a populo illius, 
cras; tantum ne addat Pharao illudere, quo minus dimittat populum ad sacrificandum JEHOVAE. 	26.  Et egressus Moscheh a cum Pharaone, et supplicavit ad JEHOVAM. 	27.  Et fecit JEHOVAH secundum 
verbum Moschis, et removit volatile noxium a Pharaone, a servis (x)illius, et a populo illius; non relictum unum. 	28.  Et aggravavit Pharao cor suum etiam vice hac, et non dimisit populum. </p>
