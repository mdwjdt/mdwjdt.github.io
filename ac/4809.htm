<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4809节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4809.</strong>“当人子在祂荣耀里来临的时候”表示当神性真理在它自己的光里显现时，如每个人死亡之时的情形；因为那时，他进入天堂之光，在这光里能理解何为真理与良善，并由此知道他的性质。就圣言的内义而言，“人子”是指神性真理方面的主，因而是指出自主的神性真理；“荣耀”是指由此流出的聪明和智慧，这聪明和智慧显为光，在天使面前显为灿烂的光芒。这灿烂的光芒含有从出自主的神性真理流出的智慧和聪明在里面，就是圣言中那被称为“荣耀”的。“人子”在内义上表示神性真理（参看<a href="2159.htm">2159</a>，<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>，<a href="2813.htm">2813</a>，<a href="3704.htm">3704</a>节）。 <br />“所有圣天使跟着祂”表示天使天堂。“圣天使”在内义上是指出自主的神性良善的真理；因为在圣言中，“天使”不是指天使，而是指那些来自主的事物（参看<a href="1925.htm">1925</a>，<a href="4085.htm">4085</a>节）。天使是从主的神性良善发出的真理之生命的接受者；天使照他们接受它的程度而为天使。由此明显可知，“天使”表示这些真理。由于此处论述的主题是每个人死后的状态，以及每个人照自己的生活所受的审判，故经上说“所有圣天使跟着祂”，以此表示审判将通过天堂实现；因为神性真理的一切流注都通过天堂进行。没有人能接受直接流注。<br />“祂要坐在祂荣耀的宝座上”表示审判，因为“宝座”论及主的王权，主的王权就是神性真理（<a href="1728.htm">1728</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="3009.htm">3009</a>，<a href="3670.htm">3670</a>节），神性真理就是那审判的起点和标准。<br />“万族都要聚集在祂面前”表示所有人的一切良善与邪恶都将变得显而易见，因为就圣言的内义而言，“（民）族”表示良善，在反面意义上表示邪恶（<a href="1259.htm">1259</a>，<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>，<a href="1416.htm">1416</a>，<a href="2588.htm">2588</a>e，<a href="4574.htm">4574</a>节）；因此，“万族都要聚集在祂面前”表示良善与邪恶将显现在神性之光中，也就是神性真理所流出的光中。<br />“祂要把他们彼此分开，好像牧羊的分开绵羊山羊一般”表示良善与邪恶分离；因为“绵羊”是指那些处于良善的人，“山羊”表示那些陷入邪恶的人。严格来说，那些处于仁爱，并由此处于信仰的人才被称为“绵羊”，那些处于信仰，但未处于仁爱的人被称为“山羊”；此处论述了这两种人。“绵羊”是指那些处于仁爱，并由此处于信仰的人（参看<a href="2088.htm">2088</a>，<a href="4169.htm">4169</a>节），“山羊”是指那些处于信仰，未处于仁爱的人（<a href="4769.htm">4769</a>节）。<br />“把绵羊安置在右边，山羊在左边”表示照着源于良善的真理和源于邪恶的虚假分离。在来世，那些处于源自良善的真理之人实实在在出现在右边，而那些陷入源自邪恶的虚假之人也实实在在出现在左边。因此，安置在右边和左边就是照取决于生活的次序安置。</p>

When the Son of man shall come in His glory; signifies when the Divine truth shall appear in its light, which takes place with every man when he dies, for he then comes into the light of heaven, in which 
he can perceive what is true and good, and hence what is his quality. The "Son of man," in the internal sense of the Word, is the Lord as to Divine truth, thus is the Divine truth which is from the 
Lord. "Glory" is the intelligence and wisdom thence derived, which appear as light, and before the angels as the resplendence of light. This resplendence of light, in which are wisdom and intelligence 
derived from the Divine truth which is from the Lord, is what in the Word is called "glory." (That the "Son of man" in the internal sense is the Divine truth, may be seen n. 2159, 2803, 2813, 3704.)  
    [2] And all the holy angels with Him; </p>
<p>signifies the angelic heaven. The "holy angels" are the truths which are from the Lord's Divine good; for by "angels" in the Word are not meant angels, 
but those things which are from the Lord (see n. 1925, 4085); for the angels are recipients of the life of truth proceeding from the Lord's Divine good, and insofar as they receive, so far they are angels. 
From this it is plain that "angels" are these truths. As the subject here treated of is the state of everyone after death, and the judgment of everyone according to his life, it is said that all 
the holy angels will be with Him; and by this is signified that the judgment will be effected by means of heaven; for all influx of Divine truth takes place through heaven, and immediate influx can be 
received by no one.      [3] Then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory; signifies the Judgment, for a "throne" is predicated of the Lord's royalty, and the Lord's royalty is the Divine truth (n. 
1728, 2015, 3009, 3670), and the Divine truth is that from which and according to which is the Judgment.      [4] And before Him shall be gathered all nations; </p>
<p>signifies that the goods and evils 
of all will be made manifest; for by "nations" in the internal sense of the Word are signified goods, and in the opposite sense evils (n. 1259, 1260, 1416, 2588, 4574); thus that goods and evils will 
appear in Divine light, that is, in light from the Divine truth, is signified by all nations being gathered before Him.      [5] And He shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth 
the sheep from the goats; </p>
<p>signifies the separation of good from evil; for the "sheep" are they who are in good, and the "goats" they who are in evil. They are properly called "sheep" who are in charity 
and thence in faith, and they "goats" who are in faith and not in charity-both being here treated of. That "sheep" are they who are in charity and thence in faith, may be seen above (n. 2088, 4169), 
and "goats" they who are in faith and not in charity (n. 4769).      [6] And He shall set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on the left; </p>
<p>signifies separation according to truths from good, 
and according to falsities from evil. In the other life they who are in truths from good actually appear to the right, and they who are in falsities from evil to the left. Hence to be set on the right 
hand and on the left, is to be set in order according to the life. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4809</b></p><p><b>4809.</b>
When the Son of Man comes in His glory means when Divine Truth will be visible in its own light, as happens to everyone when he dies; for at that time he comes into the light of heaven, in which light 
he is able to perceive what is true and good, and from this the nature of it. 'The Son of Man' in the internal sense of the Word is the Lord as regards Divine Truth, and so it is Divine Truth which 
comes from the Lord; 'glory' is intelligence and wisdom that flow from this, which is seen as light, and by angels as brilliant light. This brilliant light that holds within it wisdom and intelligence 
flowing from Divine Truth that comes from the Lord is that which in the Word is called 'the glory'. As regards 'the Son of Man' in the internal sense meaning Divine Truth, see <a href="2159.htm">2159</a>, <a href="2803.htm">2803</a>, <a href="2813.htm">2813</a>, <a href="3704.htm">3704</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
And an the holy angels with Him means the angelic heaven. 'The holy angels' in the internal sense are truths which come from the Lord's Divine Good, for in the Word the expression 'angels' is 
not used to mean angels but things that are from the Lord, see <a href="1925.htm">1925</a>, <a href="4085.htm">4085</a>. Angels are recipients of the life of truth proceeding from the Lord's Divine Good; and in the measure they receive it they are 
angels. From this it is evident that 'angels' means those truths Because the subject here is the state of each person after death, and the judgement of each one according to what his life is, it is 
said that all the holy angels will be with Him, meaning that the judgement will be effected through heaven; for every influx of Divine Truth takes places through heaven. No one can receive a direct influx. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
Then He will sit on the throne of His glory means the judgement, for 'throne' is used to refer to the Lord's kingship, and the Lord's kingship is Divine Truth, <a href="1728.htm">1728</a>, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="3009.htm">3009</a>, <a href="3670.htm">3670</a>, Divine 
Truth being the starting-point and the standard of that judgement. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 And before Him all nations will be gathered means that every good and every evil of everyone will be disclosed - for 'nations' 
in the internal sense of the Word means forms of good, and in the contrary sense forms of evil, <a href="1259.htm">1259</a>, <a href="1260.htm">1260</a>, <a href="1416.htm">1416</a>, <a href="2588.htm">2588</a> (end), <a href="4574.htm">4574</a>. Thus it is the showing up in Divine light - that is, in light flowing 
from Divine Truth - of every good and every evil that is meant by 'before Him all nations will be gathered'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 And He will separate them one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep 
from the goats means the separation of good from evil, for 'the sheep' are those in whom good is present, and 'the goats' those in whom evil is present. Strictly speaking the expression 'the sheep' is 
used to describe those in whom charity, and faith derived from charity, are present, 'the goats' to describe those in whom faith but no charity is present. Both these types of people are referred to 
here. As regards 'the sheep' meaning those in whom charity and faith derived from it are present, see <a href="2088.htm">2088</a>, <a href="4169.htm">4169</a>, and 'the goats' those in whom faith but no charity is present, <a href="4769.htm">4769</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 And He will 
place the sheep at His right hand and the goats at the left means a separation into truths derived from good, and falsities derived from evil. Those governed by truths derived from good are also visibly 
present in the next life on the right, while those governed by falsities are on the left. Consequently being stationed on the right hand and on the left implies an ordering in which life is the determining factor. </p>

Quando venerit Filius hominis in gloria Sua significat quando apparebit Divinum Verum in sua luce, (m)quod fit unicuivis homini cum moritur; venit enim tunc in lucem caeli, in qua percipere potest 
quid verum (o)et bonum, et inde qualis est;(n) `Filius hominis' in sensu Verbi interno est Dominus quoad Divinum Verum, ita est Divinum Verum quod a Domino; `gloria' est intelligentia et sapientia 
quae inde, quae ut lux, et coram angelis ut splendor lucis, apparet; hic splendor lucis in qua sapientia et intelligentia ex Divino Vero quod a Domino, est qui in Verbo vocatur `gloria'; quod `Filius 
hominis' sit in sensu interno Divinum Verum, videatur n. 2159, 2803, 2813, 3704.  [2] Et omnes sancti angeli cum Ipso significat caelum angelicum;. `sancti angeli' {1} sunt vera quae a Divino 
Bono Domini, nam per `angelos' in Verbo non intelliguntur angeli sed illa quae sunt a Domino: </p>
<p>videatur n. 1925, 4085; angeli enim sunt vitae recipientes veri procedentis a Divino Bono {2} Domini, et 
quantum recipiunt, tantum sunt angeli; inde patet quod `angeli' sint illa vera; hic quia agitur de statu cujusvis post mortem, ac de judicio cujusvis secundum vitam, dicitur quod `omnes sancti angeli 
erunt cum Ipso', et per id significatur quod per caelum judicium; omnis enim influxus Divini Veri fit per caelum; immediatus influxus a nemine recipi potest.  [3] Tunc sedebit super throno gloriae 
Ipsius significat judicium, `thronus' enim praedicatur de regio Domini, ac regium Domini est Divinum Verum, n. 1728, 2015, 3009, 3670, (c)et Divinum Verum est ex quo et secundum quod judicium. 
 [4] Et congregabuntur coram Ipso omnes gentes significat quod patebunt omnium bona et mala; per `gentes' enim in Verbi sensu interno significantur bona, et in opposito sensu mala, {3} n. 1259, 1260 1416, 
2588 f, 4574; (o)ita quod bona et mala apparebunt in luce Divina hoc est, in luce a Divino Vero, significatur per quod `congregabuntur coram Ipso omnes gentes'.  [5] Et separabit eos ab invicem, 
sicut pastor separat oves ab hircis significat separationem boni a malo; `oves' enim sunt qui in bono, et `hirci' qui in malo; `oves' proprie dicuntur qui in charitate et inde in fide, `hirci' 
{4} qui in fide et non in charitate de his et illis hic agitur; quod `oves' sint qui in charitate et inde in fide, videatur n. 2088, 4169; et quod `hirci' qui in fide et non in charitate, n. 4769. 
 [6] Et statuet quidem oves a dextris Suis, et hircos a sinistris significat separationem secundum vera ex bono et secundum falsa ex malo; qui in veris ex bono sunt, etiam actualiter apparent in 
altera vita ad dextrum, et qui in falsis a malo ad sinistrum; inde statui a dextris et a sinistris, est ordinari secundum vitam.      @1 i in sensu interno$      @2 A d$      @3 i videatur$
