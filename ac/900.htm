<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>900.</strong>“二月”表重生之前的整个状态。这一点从圣言中“二”的含义清楚可知。“二”与“六”的含义相同，即表重生之前的争战和劳碌。因此，它在此表人重生之前的整个状态。在圣言中，时间段，无论长短，通常划分为三或七，被称为日、周、月、年或代。“三”和“七”是神圣的，而在此之前的“二”或“六”是不神圣的，相对来说是不洁的，如前所述（<a href="720.htm">720</a>节）。三和七也是神圣的数字，因为它们都预示着将在第三天或第七天进行的最后审判。当主到来时，最后的审判会临到每个人，无论整体还是个体。如，当主降世时，就有了一次最后的审判，当祂在荣耀中降临时，也必会有一次最后的审判。尤其当祂临到每个人时，就会有一次最后的审判。人死之后也会有一次最后的审判等着他。这最后的审判用“第三天（日）”和“第七天（日）”来表示。对生活良善之人而言，这是一个神圣的日子，但对生活邪恶之人而言，则不然。所以，“第三天（日）”和“第七天（日）”既适用于那些被判为死亡之人，也适用于那些被判为生命之人。论及那些被判为死亡之人，这些数字表不洁之物，而论及那些被判为生命之人，则表神圣之物。先于它们的二或六一般涉及并表示此前的整个状态。这就是数字二和六的含义，无论它们牵涉什么样的主题，以及主题的哪个方面。这一点通过下文有关数字“二十七”的论述会变得更加清晰。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]900.</strong> The symbolism of the second month as all the stages that precede rebirth can be seen from the symbolism of two in the Word. Two symbolizes the same thing as six, which is the fighting and hard work that come before rebirth. So here it means all the stages we go through before becoming regenerate.<br />The longest and shortest intervals in the Word are generally split in three or in seven and are called days, weeks, months, years, or "ages."{*1} Three and seven are holy; two and six, being just one less, are not holy but relatively profane, as shown before (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_900/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_720" target=_top>720</a>).<br />Three and seven also mean something sacrosanct, each because of its connection with the Last Judgment, predicted as coming on the third or else the seventh day.{*2} Every person — both collectively and individually — has a last judgment when the Lord comes. There was a last judgment when the Lord came into the world. There will be a last judgment when he enters into his glory. There is a last judgment when he comes individually to each person. There is also a last judgment for each person who dies. This last judgment is the third day and the seventh day, which is holy for those who have lived good lives but unholy for those who have lived evil lives. Consequently, a third day and a seventh is predicted for those judged worthy of death and for those judged worthy of life, so that the numbers symbolize what is unholy for those with a verdict of death but what is holy for those with a verdict of life.<br />Two and six, the numbers just before three and seven, bear a relationship to them and symbolize in general every preceding stage. This is the meaning of the numbers two and six, and the meaning adapts to the subject at hand and to whatever the subject applies to, which the numbers describe.<br />All of this will become clearer from the discussion of the number twenty-seven in the next section.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Concerning the word "ages," see note 3 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_900/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395" target=_top>395</a>.

In the second month. That this signifies the whole state before regeneration, is evident from the signification of "two" in the Word. "Two" signifies the same as "six" that is, the combat and labor which 
precede regeneration; thus here the whole state which precedes the completion of man's regeneration. Periods of time, great and small, are commonly distinguished in the Word as "threes" or "sevens" 
and are called "days" "weeks" "months" "years" or "ages." "Three" and "seven" are holy, "two" and "six" which precede, are not holy, but are relatively profane, as before shown (n. 720). "Three" and 
"seven" are both sacred for the additional reason that they are predicated of the last judgment, which is to come on the "third" or on the "seventh" day. The last judgment comes to everyone when the 
Lord comes, both in general and in particular. For example, there was a last judgment when the Lord came into the world, and there will be a last judgment when He shall come in glory; there is a last 
judgment when He comes to any man whatever in particular; and there is also a last judgment for everyone when he dies. This last judgment is what is meant by the "third day" and the "seventh day" which 
is holy to those who have lived well, but not holy to those who have lived ill. Thus the "third day" or the "seventh day" is predicated as well of those who are adjudged to death, as of those who are 
adjudged to life; and therefore these numbers signify what is not holy to those who are adjudged to death, and what is holy to those who are adjudged to life. "Two" and "six" preceding three and seven, 
have relation to and signify in general all that state which precedes. This is the signification of "two" and of "six" in application to any subject, and to any matter that is the subject of which 
they are predicated, as is more clearly evident from what now follows about the number twenty-seven. </p>

That 'the second month' means the whole of the state prior to regeneration is clear from the meaning of 'two' in the Word. 'Two' has the same meaning as 'six', that is, the conflict and toil that come 
before regeneration. Thus here it means the whole of the state that comes before a person has been regenerated. In the Word it is common for periods of time, long or short, to be divided into threes 
or sevens and to be called days, weeks, months, years, or ages. 'Three' and 'seven' are holy, while 'two' or 'six', which come before them, are not holy but in comparison are unholy, as shown already 
in <a href="720.htm">720</a>. Three and seven are also sacred numbers because both of them occur in statements concerning the Last Judgement which will take place on the third or the seventh day. It is the last judgement 
for everybody when the Lord comes, either in general or in particular. That is to say, there was a last judgement when the Lord came into the world; there will be a last judgement when He comes in glory; 
there is a last judgement when He comes to each person in particular. There is also a last judgement awaiting everyone when he dies. This last judgement is meant by 'the third day' and 'the seventh 
day'. It is a holy day for people who have lived well, but not for those who have lived wickedly. Consequently 'the third day', and 'the seventh', apply to people for whom judgement points to death 
as well as to those for whom judgement points to life. In reference to those therefore whose judgement points to death these numbers mean that which is not holy, but in reference to those whose judgement 
points to life they mean that which is holy. Two or six which come before them relate to, and in general mean, the whole of that state which precedes. This is the meaning of the numbers two and six, 
whatever the subject and whatever the aspects of it they refer to. This becomes clearer still from what follows next concerning the number 'twenty-seven'.  </p>

Quod 'mensis secundus' significet omnem statum ante regenerationem, constat a significatione 'duo' in Verbo; 'duo' significant idem ac 'sex,' hoc est, pugnam et laborem qui praecedit regenerationem, 
ita hic omnem statum qui praecedit antequam regeneratus est. Tempora maxima et minima communiter in Verbo distinguuntur in tria aut in septem, et vocantur vel dies, vel septimanae, vel menses, vel anni, 
vel saecula; 'tria et septem' sunt sancta, 'duo aut sex' quae praecedunt, non sancta, sed respective profana, ut ostensum prius, n. 720; tria et septem quoque sunt sacrosancta, utrumque ex causa quia 
praedicantur de ultimo judicio quod venturum tertio vel septimo die; ultimum judicium unicuique est, cum Dominus venit tam in communi quam in particulari; nempe ultimum judicium fuit cum Dominus venit 
in mundum; ultimum judicium cum venturus in gloriam; ultimum judicium cum ad hominem quemcumque in particulari; ultimum judicium quoque est unicuique cum moritur; ultimum hoc judicium est 'dies tertius' 
et 'dies septimus,' qui sanctus est iis qui bene vixerunt, at non sanctus iis qui male vixerunt; quare tam de iis qui judicantur ad mortem, praedicatur 'dies tertius et septimus' quam de iis qui 
judicantur ad vitam; inde numeri illi significant non sanctum iis qui judicantur ad mortem, at sanctum iis qui judicantur ad vitam. Duo aut sex quae praecedunt, se habent respective et significant 
in genere omnem illum statum qui praecedit; haec significatio est numerorum duo et sex, et se habent applicate ad quodcumque subjectum, et ad quamcumque rem quae est subjectum, de qua praedicantur: quod 
manifestius constare potest ab bis quae nunc sequuntur de numero 'viginti septem.' </p>
