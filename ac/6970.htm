<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6970节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6970.</strong>“将来他们若不信你”表他们若没有信。这从“信”的含义清楚可知，“信”是指拥有信（参看<a href="6956.htm">6956</a>节）。拥有信在此不是指他们由于表明他们将从埃及被解救的神迹而拥有的信，因为这种信与世俗事物有关；相反，它是指对他们若不持守真理，就会变得完全感官和肉体化，最终变成真理的亵渎者的信；因为这些就是这两个神迹的含义。内义并不像外在历史意义那样论述世俗事物，而是论述属灵事物。对世俗事物的信完全不同于对属灵事物的信。例如：相信人们会言行一致；一个人是否真实；若要确保成功，一个人应如此如此行，而不可那样行；所说或所写的是否可信；除此之外还有其它无数类似例子。这类事就属于对世俗事物的信，此处以色列人要从埃及的奴役中被解救出来也属于这种信。但是，相信有一个天堂和一个地狱；人们死后还会活着，善人永远处于幸福的状态，恶人则陷入痛苦的状态；生命与每个人同在；信与仁构成属灵的生命，这就是天上的天使所拥有的生命；主拥有天上地上一切的权柄，如祂自己所说的（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.18.htm">28:18</a>）；我们都从祂那里接受自己的生命，或说我们靠祂存活；圣言是天上的教义和神性真理；这些和类似的其它事就是属于对属灵事物之信的那类事，也是此处的“信”所表示的。</p>

And it shall be, if they do not believe thee. That this signifies if they have not faith, is evident from the signification of "believing," as being to have faith (see n. 6956). To have faith here does 
not signify faith from the signs, that they were to be liberated from Egypt, for this faith relates to worldly things; but it signifies faith that if they did not remain in truths they would become 
merely sensuous and corporeal, and at last profaners of truth; for these are what the two signs signify. The internal sense does not treat of worldly things, as does the external historic sense; but 
of spiritual things. Faith in worldly things is quite different from faith in spiritual things, as for example: to believe that men will do as they speak; that a man is true or not true; that to insure 
success, a man should do so and so, and not otherwise; that what is said or written is worthy of credit, or not, besides numberless like things; such are matters of faith in worldly things, as also 
here that the sons of Israel were to be liberated from bondage in Egypt. But to believe that there is a heaven and a hell; that men will live after death, the good in happiness to eternity, the evil in 
unhappiness; that the life remains with everyone; that faith and charity make spiritual life, and that this is the life which the angels have in heaven; that the Lord has all power in the heavens and 
on earth, as He Himself says (Matt. 28:18); that from Him we live; that the Word is the doctrine of heavenly and Divine truths; and the like - such are matters of faith in spiritual things, and are 
here signified by "believing." </p>

'And so it will be, if they do not believe you' means if they are not in possession of faith. This is clear from the meaning of 'believing' as being in possession of faith, as above in <a href="6956.htm">6956</a>. Here possessing 
faith does not imply the faith they had as a result of signs which indicated that they were to be delivered from Egypt, for that kind of faith has to do with worldly matters. What is meant is 
a faith recognizing that if they did not hold fast to truths they would become wholly sensory- and bodily-minded, and finally profaners of truth; for this is the meaning that the two signs have. The internal 
sense does not deal with worldly matters, as the external sense written as history does, but to spiritual ones. Faith in matters that are worldly is altogether different from faith in those which 
are spiritual. Take, for example, believing that people will act as they say they will; that a person is genuine or not genuine; that such and such and no other course of action should be taken if 
some matter is to succeed; that spoken or written statements are creditable or not creditable; and countless other examples in addition to these. These kinds of things belong to faith in matters that 
are worldly, as also does the belief here that the children of Israel are to be delivered from slavery in Egypt. But believing that there is a heaven; that there is a hell; that people will go on living 
after death, the good in a state of happiness for ever, the wicked in a state of unhappiness; that life awaits everyone; that faith and charity constitute the spiritual life, and that this is the 
life angels in heaven have; that the Lord has all power in heaven and on earth, as He Himself says in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2028:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 28:18</a>; that we receive our life from Him; that the Word comprises teaching about heavenly and 
Divine truths - these and others things like them are the kind that belong to faith in spiritual matters and are what are meant here by 'believing'. </p>

`Et erit, si non credunt tibi': quod significet si non fidem {1}habeant, constat ex significatione `credere' quod sit fidem habere, ut supra n. 6956; hic fidem habere non significat fidem ex signis, 
quod liberandi ex Aegypto, nam haec fides de mundanis est, sed fidem si non permanent in veris, quod fierent mere sensuales et corporei, et demum veri profanatores; haec enim sunt quae bina signa significant; 
sensus internus non agit de mundanis, prout sensus {2}externus historicus, sed de spiritualibus; fides in mundanis prorsus differt a fide in spiritualibus, ut pro exemplo: credere quod (x) facturi 
sicut loquuntur: quod verus homo sit vel non verus: quod ita faciendum, non aliter, ut res succedat: quod {3}dicta aut scripta fide digna sint vel non sint, praeter similia innumera; talia sunt 
fidei in mundanis, ut quoque hic quod filii Israelis liberandi sint a servitute in Aegypto.  At credere quod caelum sit: quod infernum: quod victuri post mortem, boni in felicitate in aeternum, mali 
in infelicitate: quod vita unumquemvis maneat: quod fides et charitas faciant vitam spiritualem, et quod haec vita sit quae est angelis in caelo: quod Domino sit omnis potestas in caelis et in terris, 
sicut Ipse dicit, Matth. xxviii 18: quod ab Ipso vivamus: quod Verbum sit doctrina veritatum caelestium et Divinarum, et similia talia sunt fidei in spiritualibus, et significantur hic per `credere.' 	@1
