<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4403节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">大人与对应（续）</h4><br />此处涉及与眼睛和光的对应关系<br />【节】4403.我也曾蒙允许根据他们相对于我的位置和地方，以及他们所在的层面并在其中的距离发现和知道灵人的品质，以及他们属于身体的哪个区域。我所看到的身边这些人大部分是整个社群的使臣；因为社群自派灵人到其他灵人那里，他们通过这些灵人觉察思维和情感，以这种方式与其他人联系。不过，关于这些所谓的使臣，或使者灵，蒙主的神性怜悯，有必要详细说一说。关于他们，我发现以下事实。看上去在我头顶上和头旁边的，是那些教导人，也允许自己被教导的人；在我脑后下方的，是那些行事安静、谨慎的人；在我后背附近的，与这些人相似，但又有不同；靠近胸膛或胸部的，是那些处于仁爱的人；靠近两腰的，是那些处于婚姻之爱的人；靠近双脚的，是那些属世之人；靠近脚底的，则这类人中更为低等的成员。不过，靠近我脸的，照着他们与该部位感觉器官的对应而性质各异。例如，靠近鼻子的，在感知上优胜一筹；靠近耳朵的，都是很顺服的人；靠近眼睛的，则是聪明和智慧的人，等等。</p>

CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE GRAND MAN AND CONCERNING CORRESPONDENCE, HERE CONCERNING CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE EYE AND WITH LIGHT.                          Of what quality spirits were, and to what province 
of the body they belonged, it has also been given me to observe and know from their position and place with me, and also from the plane in which they were, and from their distance therein. Those 
who were seen near me were for the most part subjects of entire societies; for societies send spirits from themselves to others, and through these spirits they perceive the thoughts and affections, 
and thus effect communication. But concerning these so-called Subjects that is, emissary spirits-something shall of the Lord's Divine mercy be said in particular. The following facts have been observed 
in connection with these emissary spirits. Those who appear above the head, and near it, are those who teach, and who also easily suffer themselves to be taught. Those who are under the back of the 
head are those who act silently and prudently. Those who are near the back act similarly, with a difference. Those who are at the chest or breast are those who are in charity. Those who are at the loins 
are those who are in conjugial love. Those who are at the feet are those who are natural, and those who are at the soles of the feet are the more gross of this kind. But those who are at the face vary 
in genius, according to their correspondence with the sensories of this part, those for instance who are at the nostrils are those who excel in perception, those who are at the ears are those who 
obey, and those who are at the eyes are those who are intelligent and wise, and so on. </p>

THE GRAND MAN AND CORRESPONDENCE - continued IN THIS SECTION CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE EYE AND WITH LIGHT </p>
<p>I have also been allowed to become aware of and get to know the character of spirits and which 
province of the body they belonged to from their position and place in relation to myself, and also from the level they were on, and from how far away they were on that level. Those I saw close to 
me were for the most part the subordinates of whole communities, for communities send spirits from themselves to other spirits, and through these they perceive others' thoughts and affections, and in 
this manner communicate with others. But those subordinates so-called, or emissary spirits, will in the Lord's Divine mercy be taken as a separate subject. Concerning them I have made the following observations. 
Those to be seen over and close to my head are ones who teach and also readily allow themselves to be taught. Those beneath the back of my head are ones who act quietly and with circumspection, 
and those just away from my back act in a similar yet differing manner to these. Those close to my chest or breast are ones who are moved by charity; those close to the loins ones moved by conjugial 
love; those close to the feet ones who are natural; and those close to the soles of the feet are more inferior members of this last kind. But those close to my face vary in disposition, that variation 
being determined by their correspondence with the sensory organs located there. Those close to the nostrils, for example, excel in perception; those close to the ears are the obedient; those close 
to the eyes are the intelligent and wise; and so on. </p>

<p>Spiritus quales essent et ad quam provinciam corporis pertinerent 
etiam animadvertere et scire datum est ex illorum situ et loco apud me, tum quoque a plano in quo essent, et a distantia in illo: qui prope ad me visi sunt, utplurimum fuerunt subjecta integrarum 
societatum; societates enim a se (x)mittunt spiritus ad alios, et per illos percipiunt cogitata et affectiones, et sic communicant; (o)sed de `subjectis' ita dictis seu de `spiritibus emissariis', 
singillatim, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, dicetur; </p>
<p>de quibus haec observata sunt; qui supra caput apparent et prope ad illud, sunt qui docent et quoque facile doceri se patiuntur; qui sub 
occipitio, sunt qui tacite et {1} prudenter agunt; qui a tergo (o)prope, similiter cum differentia; qui ad thoracem seu pectus, sunt qui in charitate; qui ad lumbos, sunt qui in amore conjugiali; </p>
<p>qui 
ad pedes, sunt qui naturales sunt; et qui ad plantas, sunt illius generis crassiores: qui autem ad {2} faciem, sunt diverso genio secundum correspondentiam cum sensoriis quae ibi; ut qui ad nares, 
sunt qui perceptione pollent; qui ad aures, sunt qui oboediunt; et qui ad oculos, sunt qui intelligentes et sapientes sunt; et sic porro.      @1 at$      @2 circum$ </p>
