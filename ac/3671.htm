<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3671节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3671.</strong>“给你和同你一起的你种”表与良善和从这良善所生的真理（结合）。这从雅各的代表和“种”的含义清楚可知：雅各，就是此处“你”所指的，是指真理的良善，或来自真理的良善，如前所述；“种”是指信之良善与真理（<a href="1025.htm">1025</a>，<a href="1447.htm">1447</a>，<a href="1610.htm">1610</a>，<a href="2848.htm">2848</a>，<a href="3373.htm">3373</a>节）。“同你一起”表它被联结于“雅各”所代表的真理的良善。良善与真理如同种子和土壤。内层良善如同多产的种子，不过，只能被种在好土里。外层良善与真理则如同种子在其中变得多产的土壤。否则，这种子，也就是内层良善与真理就无法扎根。因此，人的理性先重生，因为种子就在其中；然后属世层再重生，以便给它们充当土壤（<a href="3286.htm">3286</a>，<a href="3288.htm">3288</a>，<a href="3321.htm">3321</a>，<a href="3368.htm">3368</a>，<a href="3493.htm">3493</a>，<a href="3576.htm">3576</a>，<a href="3620.htm">3620</a>，<a href="3623.htm">3623</a>节）。由于属世层如同土壤，故良善与真理能在理性层里面繁殖增多。但是，如果它们没有土壤在某个地方，以便它们像种子那样扎根于其中，那么这一切是不可能的事。从这种对比可以如在一面镜子中那样看出重生的性质，以及它的奥秘何等得多。<br />理解并意愿良善与真理是理性层的功能，由此所产生的对良善与真理的直觉则如同种子；而知道并行出它们是属世层的功能。记忆知识和行为如同土壤。若一个人拥有对确证良善与真理的记忆知识的情感，尤其在行出它们时体验到快乐，那么种子就在其中，并且如同在自己适宜的土壤中那样生长。结果，良善繁殖，真理增多，它们不断从这土里冒出来，然后进入理性层并完善它。若一个人理解何为良善与真理，也从内在觉察到某种意愿的倾向，却不喜欢知道这些事，更不用说行出来了，那么情况就截然不同了。在这种情况下，良善无法在理性层里面繁殖，真理也无法在理性层里面增多。</p>

To thee and to thy seed with thee. That this signifies with the good and its derivative truth, is evident from the representation of Jacob, who is here meant by "thee," as being the good of truth, or 
the good which is from truth (concerning which see above); and from the signification of "seed," as being the good and truth of faith (n. 1025, 1447, 1610, 2848, 3373). "With thee" signifies that it 
was adjoined to the good of truth which is "Jacob." With good and truth the case is the same as with seeds and the ground; interior good is as the seed which brings forth, but only in good ground; exterior 
good and truth are as the ground in which the seed brings forth; this seed (that is, interior good and truth) cannot otherwise be rooted. For this reason man's rational is first of all regenerated, 
for therein are seeds, and afterwards the natural, in order that it may serve as ground (n. 3286, 3288, 3321, 3368, 3493, 3576, 3620, 3623); and since the natural is as ground, good and truth are 
capable of being made fruitful and multiplying in the rational, which could not be the case unless they had ground somewhere, in which they might take root like seed. From this comparison it may be seen 
as in a mirror how the case is with regeneration and with many of its arcana.  [2] To understand good and truth and to will them is of the rational; the perceptions of good and truth therefrom are 
as seed; but to know them and bring them into act is of the natural. The very memory-knowledges and works are like ground, and when man is affected with the memory-knowledges which confirm good and truth; 
and especially when he feels a delight in bringing them into act, the seeds are therein, and grow as in their ground. By this means good is made fruitful, and truth is multiplied, and they continually 
ascend from this ground into the rational, and perfect it. The case is otherwise when man understands good and truth, and also inwardly perceives some inclination of will thereto, but yet does 
not love to know them, and still less to do them. In this case good cannot be made fruitful nor truth be multiplied, in the rational. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3671</b></p><p><b>3671.</b>
'You and your seed with you' means to the good and the truth born from this good. This is clear from the representation of Jacob, to whom 'you' refers here, as the good of truth, or good that is a product 
of truth, dealt with above, and from the meaning of 'seed' as the good and truth of faith, dealt with in <a href="1025.htm">1025</a>, <a href="1447.htm">1447</a>, <a href="1610.htm">1610</a>, <a href="2848.htm">2848</a>, <a href="3373.htm">3373</a>. 'With you' means that it was allied to the good of truth, represented 
by 'Jacob'. Good and truth are like seeds and the soil. Interior good is like seed that is productive, though not unless it is sown in good soil. Exterior good and truth are like the soil in 
which it is made productive. The former, that is to say, the seed, which is interior good and truth, cannot otherwise take root. This is why a person's rational is regenerated first of all, for the 
rational is where the seeds are; then after that the natural is regenerated to serve as the soil for them, <a href="3286.htm">3286</a>, <a href="3288.htm">3288</a>, <a href="3321.htm">3321</a>, <a href="3368.htm">3368</a>, <a href="3493.htm">3493</a>, <a href="3576.htm">3576</a>, <a href="3620.htm">3620</a>, <a href="3623.htm">3623</a>. And because the natural is like the soil, good 
and truth can be made fruitful and be multiplied within the rational, which could not take place if the soil where the seed has its root were anywhere else. From this comparison one may see as in a 
mirror what regeneration is like and the numerous arcana that go with it. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 Understanding good and truth and willing them is the function of the rational, and perceptions of good and truth resulting 
from this are like seeds; but knowing them and doing them is the function of the natural. Facts and deeds are like the soil. When a person has an affection for the facts that corroborate what is good 
and true, the more so when he experiences joy in acting them out, those facts are seeds that are present and growing in the natural as their own proper soil; and there they grow. As a consequence 
good is made fruitful and truth is multiplied, and they are constantly springing up out of that soil into the rational and perfecting it. The situation is different when a person understands what is good 
and true, and also interiorly perceives that he wills something, and yet does not desire to know these things, let alone do them. In that case good cannot be made fruitful nor truth be multiplied 
within the rational. </p>

`Tibi et semini tuo cum te':  quod significet cum bono et vero quod inde, constat ex repraesentatione Jacobi, qui hic est `tibi,' quod sit {1}bonum veri seu bonum quod ex vero, de qua supra; et ex 
significatione `seminis' quod sit bonum et verum fidei, de qua n. 1025, 1447, 1610, 2848, 3373; `cum te' significat quod adjunctum bono veri, quod est `Jacob.'  Se habet cum bono et vero, sicut cum seminibus, 
et cum humo; bonum interius est sicut semen quod producit sed non nisi quam in bona humo; bonum et verum exterius est sicut humus, in qua producitur; illud, nempe semen, quod est bonum et verum 
interius, non aliter radicari potest; inde est quod rationale hominis {2}omnium primo regeneratur, nam ibi sunt semina, et dein naturale, ut hoc inserviat pro humo, n. 3286, 3288, 3321, 3368, 3493, 
3576, 3620, 3623; et quia naturale est sicut humus, bonum et verum fructificari et multiplicari potest in rationali, quod non fieri posset nisi alicubi haberet humum, in qua semen suam radicem.  Ex 
hac comparatione, sicut in speculo videri potest quomodo se habet cum regeneratione{3}, et cum plurimis arcanis ejus; [2] intelligere bonum et verum et velle illa, est rationalis, perceptiones boni et 
veri inde sunt sicut semina, at scire illa et agere illa est naturalis; ipsa scientifica et opera sunt sicut humus; quando homo afficitur scientificis quae confirmant bonum et verum, et magis cum jucundum 
appercipit in agendo illa, tunc sunt semina ibi ut in sua humo, et crescunt; inde bonum fructificatur et verum multiplicatur, et continue ex humo illa ascendunt in rationale, et hoc perficiunt; 
aliter se habet cum homo intelligit bonum et verum, et quoque interius {4}percipit aliquid velle, sed usque non amat scire illa, et minus facere illa, tunc non fructificari potest bonum et multiplicari 
verum in rationali. @1 bonum quod ex vero seu bonum veri$ @2 before rationale$ @3 i hominis$ @4 vult illud$ </p>
