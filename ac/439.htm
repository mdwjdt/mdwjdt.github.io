<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第439节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>439.</strong>“塞特”表能从中得仁之信，这在上节已经说明。他的“儿子起名叫以挪士”表视仁为信之第一要素的教会，这一点从前文，以及它被叫做“以挪士”的事实明显可知，这个名字也表“人”，但不是属天之人，而是有人性的属灵之人，在此被称为“以挪士”。同样从接下来的话明显可知：“那时候，人才求告耶和华的名”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]439.</strong> The symbolism of Seth as a faith that allows for the growth of charity was shown at the previous verse. The symbolism of his son, whose name was Enosh, as a church that considered charity to be faith's principal concern can also be seen from earlier statements.{*1} In addition this can be seen from the fact that the child is called Enosh, another name meaning person — not a heavenly person but an individual with a spiritual nature, who is Enosh here.<br />It can be seen from the very next words as well: then people began to call on the name of Jehovah.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg links Enosh with charity at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_439/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_336" target=_top>336</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_439/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_436" target=_top>436</a>, and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_439/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_438" target=_top>438</a>.

That by "Seth" is signified the faith through which comes charity, was shown in the preceding verse. That by his "son, whose name was Enosh" is signified a church that regarded charity as the principal 
of faith, is also evident from what has been said before, as well as from the fact that it is called "Enosh" which name also means a "man" not a celestial man, but that human spiritual man which is 
here called "Enosh." The same is evident also from the words that immediately follow: "then began they to call upon the name of Jehovah." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 439</b></p><p><b>439.</b>
That 'Seth' means faith through which charity may be received was shown in the previous verse. 'His son whose name was Enosh' means a Church which considered charity to be the primary element of faith. 
This too is clear from what has been stated already, and also from the fact that he was called Enosh, another name which means man (homo), not the celestial man however but the truly human spiritual 
man, meant here by Enosh. And this is also clear from the statement immediately following about their beginning to call on the name of Jehovah.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 439</b>
</p><b>439.</b>
Quod per 'Sheth' significetur fides per quam charitas, in versu praecedente ostensum est: quod per 'filium ejus, cujus nomen Enosh' significetur Ecclesia quae charitatem pro principali fidei habui:, 
constat etiam ex iis quae prius dicta sunt; tum ex eo quod nominetur Enosh, quod nomen etiam significat hominem, at non caelestem hominem sed humanum spiritualem hominem, qui hic est 'Enosh': tum quoque 
constat ex illis quae immediate sequuntur quod 'tunc coeptum sit invocare nomen Jehovae.' </p>
