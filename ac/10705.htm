<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10705节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10705</strong>.“以色列人看见摩西的脸，他的面皮正发光”表诚然，以色列民族承认圣言里面有某种内在之物，但他们不想知道它的性质。这从“看见”、“摩西的脸”和“他的面皮发光”的含义清楚可知：“看见”是指觉察、理解和信仰（参看<a href="2150.htm">2150</a>，<a href="2325.htm">2325</a>，<a href="2807.htm">2807</a>，<a href="3764.htm">3764</a>，<a href="3863.htm">3863</a>，<a href="3869.htm">3869</a>，<a href="4403.htm">4403</a>-<a href="4421.htm">4421</a>，<a href="4567.htm">4567</a>，<a href="4723.htm">4723</a>，<a href="5114.htm">5114</a>，<a href="5400.htm">5400</a>，<a href="6805.htm">6805</a>，<a href="7650.htm">7650</a>，<a href="9128.htm">9128</a>节），因而也指承认（参看<a href="897.htm">897</a>，<a href="3796.htm">3796</a>节）；“摩西的脸”是指圣言的内在事物（<a href="10703.htm">10703</a>节）；“他的面皮发光”是指内在之物在外在之物里面的闪耀（也可参看<a href="10703.htm">10703</a>节）。众所周知，这个民族承认圣言里面有某种内在之物，因为他们说，神性奥秘就藏在那里的每个字母里面。但当被告知，这些秘密与主，祂在天上和地上的国度，以及爱祂和信祂有关时，他们却不想知道这些事。这就是这句话的意思，即：诚然，这个民族承认圣言里面有某种内在之物，但他们不想知道它的性质。这也解释了为什么接下来经上说“摩西又用帕子蒙上脸”，以此表示因此，内在事物向他们关闭。</p>

And the sons of Israel saw the faces of Moses, that the skin of Moses' faces shone. That this signifies that the Israelitish nation did indeed acknowledge that there is an internal in the Word, but that 
they did not wish to know the nature of it, is evident from the signification of "seeing," as being perception, understanding, faith (see n. 2150, 2325, 2807, 3764, 3863, 3869, 4403-4421, 4567, 4723, 
5114, 5400, 6805, 7650, 9128; consequently also acknowledgment, n. 897, 3796); from the signification of "the faces of Moses," as being the internal things of the Word (n. 10703); and from the signification 
of "the shining of the skin of his faces," as being the shining forth of the internal in the external (see also above, n. 10703). It is known that that nation acknowledges that there is an 
internal in the Word, for they say that Divine secrets are stored up therein even in every syllable. But when they are told that these secrets are about the Lord, about His kingdom in the heavens and 
on earth, and about love to Him and faith in Him, they do not wish to know. This is meant by that nation indeed acknowledging that there is an internal in the Word, but not wishing to know the nature 
of it; and therefore the statement follows that "Moses drew back the veil upon his faces," by which is signified that for this reason the internal was closed to them. </p>

'And the children of Israel saw Moses' face, that the skin of Moses' face was gleaming' means that the Israelite nation did, it is true, acknowledge the presence in the Word of something inward, but 
that they had no wish to know the nature of it. This is clear from the meaning of 'seeing' as perception, understanding, and faith, dealt with in <a href="2150.htm">2150</a>, <a href="2325.htm">2325</a>, <a href="2807.htm">2807</a>, <a href="3764.htm">3764</a>, <a href="3863.htm">3863</a>, <a href="3869.htm">3869</a>, <a href="4403.htm">4403</a>-<a href="4421.htm">4421</a>, <a href="4567.htm">4567</a>, <a href="4723.htm">4723</a>, <a href="5114.htm">5114</a>, <a href="5400.htm">5400</a>, <a href="6805.htm">6805</a>, <a href="7650.htm">7650</a>, <a href="9128.htm">9128</a>, consequently acknowledgement as well, <a href="897.htm">897</a>, <a href="3796.htm">3796</a>; from the meaning of 'the face of Moses' as the inward things of the Word, dealt with above in <a href="10703.htm">10703</a>; and from the meaning 
of 'the gleaming of the skin of his face' as the shining forth of what is inward in what is outward, also dealt with above in <a href="10703.htm">10703</a>. It is well known that this nation acknowledges the presence in 
the Word of something inward, for they speak of the concealment of Divine arcana or secrets there within every letter. But when they are told that those secrets have regard to the Lord, to His kingdom 
in heaven and on earth, and to loving Him and believing in Him, they do not wish to know these things. This is what should be understood when it is said that this nation did, it is true, acknowledge 
the presence in the Word of something inward, but that they had no wish to know the nature of it. This also accounts for what is stated next, that Moses drew the veil back over his face, meaning that 
therefore what was inward was closed off from them.  </p>

`Et viderunt filii Israelis facies Moschis, quod coruscaret cutis facierum Moschis':  quod significet quod gens Israelitica quidem agnosceret in Verbo dari internum, sed non velit scire quale id, constat 
ex significatione `videre' quod sit perceptio, intellectus, fides, de qua n. 2150, 2325, 2807, 3764, 3863, 3869, 4403-4421, 4567, 4723, 5114, 5400, 6805, 7650, 9128, inde etiam agnitio, n. 897, 
3796, ex significatione `facierum Moschis' quod (x)sint interna Verbi, de qua supra n. 10703, et ex significatione `coruscationis cutis facierum ejus' quod sit elucentia {1}interni in externo, de qua 
etiam supra n. 10703.  Quod gens illa agnoscat dari internum in Verbo notum est, {2}dicunt enim Divina arcana ibi usque in unaquavis syllaba recondi; sed cum dicitur illis quod arcana illa sint de Domino, 
de regno Ipsius in caelis et in terris, deque amore et fide in Ipsum, non volunt scire; hoc intelligitur per quod gens illa quidem agnoscat in Verbo dari internum, sed non velit scire quali id; quapropter 
etiam sequitur quod Moscheh reduxerit velamen super facies suas, per quod significatur quod ideo illis internum occluderetur.   @1 ab interno$ @2 nam dicunt$ </p>
