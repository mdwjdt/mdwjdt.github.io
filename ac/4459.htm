<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4459节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4459.</strong>“雅各的儿子们就以诡诈回答示剑和他父亲哈抹”表对古人当中的教会真理与良善所怀的邪恶思想和意图。这从“示剑”和“哈抹”的代表，以及“诡诈”的含义清楚可知：“示剑”是指古人当中的真理，或也可说，源于古代神性支系的真理（参看<a href="4399.htm">4399</a>，<a href="4454.htm">4454</a>节）；“哈抹”是指该真理所出自的良善（<a href="4399.htm">4399</a>，<a href="4431.htm">4431</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="4454.htm">4454</a>节）；“诡诈”是指邪恶的思想和意图，事实上，就一般意义而言，“诡诈”意味着反对别人、反对他所言所行的邪恶，因为诡诈之人的思想和意图总与别人的相反，这也可从本章所描述的事件结果清楚看出来。由此明显可知，“雅各的儿子们就以诡诈回答示剑和他父亲哈抹”表示对古人当中的教会真理与良善所怀的邪恶思想和意图。<br />雅各的儿子或后代只能对内在人的真理与良善怀有邪恶思想和意图，因为他们对缺乏内在的外在事物感兴趣（参看<a href="4281.htm">4281</a>，<a href="4293.htm">4293</a>，<a href="4307.htm">4307</a>，<a href="4429.htm">4429</a>，<a href="4433.htm">4433</a>节）。他们根本看不见内在事物的价值，因而完全藐视它们。如今这个民族仍具有这种性质，这也是所有只对外在事物感兴趣之人的性质。只对外在事物感兴趣的人甚至不知道对内在事物感兴趣是什么样，因为他们不知道何为内在之物。若有人当着他们的面提及内在之物，他们要么由于从教义知道它的存在而承认它（然而，这种承认可归因于他们的诡诈），要么无论嘴上还是心里都否认它的存在。因为他们无法超越外在人的感觉经验，因而不相信死后有什么生命，也不相信除了肉体上的复活外，还有任何复活的可能性。正因如此，他们被允许拥有这种复活观，否则，他们就什么观念也没有了。因为他们将整个生命都集中在身体上，殊不知，其身体生命来自其死后活着的灵之生命。只对外在事物感兴趣的人绝无可能拥有任何信仰，因为他们当中的外在事物会毁灭关于内在事物的一切思维，因而毁灭他们里面的一切信仰。<br />由于如今这种无知仍占据主导地位，故有必要解释一下何为对缺乏内在的外在事物感兴趣。所有缺乏良知的人都只对外在事物感兴趣，因为内在人通过良知显示它自己。凡思考并行出真理与良善不是为了真理与良善的缘故，而是为了自己个人的地位和利益，以及仅仅因为害怕法律和自己的生命之人都没有良知。因为如果名声、地位、利益和生命没有受到威胁，他就会毫无良心地冲向各种难以启齿的恶行。在来世，这一事实从那些活在肉身时就具有这种秉性的人身上看得很明显，所以这些人不断努力摧毁别人，因此他们在地狱中，在那里以属灵的方式被约束。<br />为叫人们更全面地了解何谓对外在事物的兴趣，何谓对内在事物的兴趣；也叫他们知道只对外在事物感兴趣的人不可能对何为内在事物形成任何概念，因而不可能感受到对它们的任何情感（因为人对他没有任何概念的事物不会有任何情感），我们举个例子。在天上，最小的就是最大的，谦卑的必升为高；以及穷乏困苦的要富足有余。只对外在事物感兴趣的人无法理解这些事，因为他们认为，最小的绝无可能成为最大的，谦卑的不可能升为高，穷乏人不可能富足，困苦人也不可能有余，尽管这正是在天上的情形。他们因无法理解这些事，故也无法感受到对它们的任何情感；当出于他们所陷入的肉体和世俗事物反思它们时，他们对它们感到厌恶。他们根本不知道天上竟有这种事，并且只要唯独对外在事物感兴趣，也不想知道，甚至不能知道它们。然而，在天上，发自内心，也就是出于情感知道、承认并相信，他凭自己毫无能力，他所拥有的能力皆出自主的人被称为最小的。然而，他却是最大的，因为他的能力出自主。谦卑之人的情形也一样，他必升为高；对因出于情感承认并相信，他凭自己毫无能力、聪明智慧，以及良善与真理而谦卑下来的人，主所赐予他的能力、对真理的聪明理解和对良善的智慧洞察要多于其他人。富足有余的穷乏困苦之人也一样；因为被称为穷乏困苦的，是那出于内心和情感相信，他凭自己一无所有，什么也不知道，在一切事上都没有智慧，毫无能力的人。在天上，这种人是富足有余的，因为主赐给他一切财富，以致他比谁都智慧，比谁都富足，并且住在最宏伟的宫殿（<a href="1116.htm">1116</a>，<a href="1626.htm">1626</a>，<a href="1627.htm">1627</a>节）和天上一切财富的宝库中。<br />另举一例。只对外在事物感兴趣的人完全不能理解天上的喜乐就是爱邻胜己，爱主高于一切，并且幸福就取决于这爱的质和量。因为只对外在事物感兴趣的人爱己胜邻；即便爱他人，也是因为他们偏向他，因此他爱他们是为了自己的缘故，因而是在他们里面爱自己，在自己里面爱他们。像这样的人不可能知道什么叫爱人胜己，事实上既不想知道，也不愿知道。所以当被告知天堂就在于这样的爱（<a href="548.htm">548</a>节）时，他很排斥这种观念。正因如此，那些活在世上时就具有这种秉性的人无法接受天上的任何社群；一旦接近，他们便因对它的排斥而使自己一头栽入地狱。<br />由于如今很少有人知道何谓对外在事物感兴趣，何谓对内在事物感兴趣，还由于绝大多数人以为那些对内在事物感兴趣的人对外在事物不感兴趣，反之亦然，所以我再举一个例子说明这个问题。就拿身体的滋养和灵魂的滋养来说：只对外在快乐感兴趣的人会花费大量精力保养自己的皮肤，满足自己的胃口，喜欢奢华的生活，认为人生最大的乐趣就是吃好的喝好的。对内在事物感兴趣的人也以这些事为乐，但其主导情感是以令人愉悦的食物滋养他的身体，以便身体能够健康，所着眼的目的是健康身体里面的健康心灵。他最关心的是心灵的健康，而身体的健康只是服务心灵健康的一种手段。人若是一个属灵之人，不会就此止步，而是将心灵或灵魂的健康视为获得聪明智慧的一种手段，不是为了名声、地位或利益，而是为了死后的生命。在更内在的层面上属灵的人，视聪明智慧为一种居间目的，使他能够作为一个有用成员在主国度中进行服侍；而属天之人关注聪明智慧是为了能事奉主。对这种人来说，身体的食物是享受属灵食物的一种手段，属灵食物是享受属天食物的一种手段。它们应以这种方式来服侍，所以这些食物也是对应，并因此被称为食物。从这些例子可以看出何谓只对外在事物感兴趣，何谓对内在事物感兴趣，<br />本章在内在历史意义上所论述的犹太和以色列民族，除了那些小时候死去的人外，绝大部分具有上述秉性。他们因贪婪而对外在事物的兴趣比其他所有人都要大。那些仅仅为了金银而喜爱利益、好处，并将生命的全部快乐都投入到这些财物中的人就住在最外围或最低级的地方，因为他们所爱的对象纯粹是世俗事物。而那些为了某种功用而喜悦金银的人则能照着这种功用而上升到世俗事物之上。人所爱的功用本身决定了他的生命，并将他与其他人区分开来；邪恶的功用使他像地狱里的人，而良善的功用则使他像天上的人。事实上，并不是功用本身，而是功用背后的爱使他这样，因为每个人的生命都在他的爱里面。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4459</b></p><p><b>4459.</b>
And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father in fraud. That this signifies an evil opinion and intention concerning the truth and good of the Church among the Ancients, is evident from 
the representation of Shechem, as being the truth among the ancients, or what is the same, truth from the ancient Divine stock (see n. 4399, 4454); from the representation of Hamor, as being the good 
from which came this truth (n. 4399, 4431, 4447, 4454); and from the signification of "fraud,"' as being an evil opinion and intention, for in a general sense "fraud" implies evil against another, and 
against what he speaks and what he does, because he who is in fraud thinks and intends that which is contrary to another, as is also evident from the effect described in this chapter. Hence it is evident 
that by the "sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father in fraud," is signified an evil opinion and intention concerning the truth and good of the Church among the Ancients.  [2] The sons 
or descendants of Jacob could have no other than an evil opinion and intention concerning the truth and good of the internal man, because they were in externals without internals (see n. 4281, 4293, 
4307, 4429, 4433); and they also made internal things of no account, and therefore utterly despised them. Such also is that nation at this day, and such are all who are in external things alone. They 
who are in external things alone do not even know what it is to be in internal things, for they do not know what that which is internal is. If anyone in their presence mentions what is internal they 
either affirm it to be so because they know it from doctrine (yet making this affirmation in fraud), or else they deny it with both heart and lips, for they go no further than the sensuous things of 
the external man. Consequently they do not believe in any life after death, nor that any resurrection is possible unless they are to rise with their bodies, and therefore they are permitted to have such 
an opinion of the resurrection, because otherwise they would have none at all, for they vest all life in the body, not knowing that the life of the body is from the life of the spirit which lives 
after death. They who are in externals alone can have no other belief; for with them external things extinguish all thought about internal things, and consequently all faith in them. [3] At the present 
day this kind of ignorance reigns supreme, and therefore it is necessary to state what it is to be in external things apart from internal things. All those who are devoid of conscience are in external 
things alone, for the internal man manifests itself by conscience; and all those have no conscience who think and do what is true and good not for the sake of what is true and good, but for the sake 
of self by reason of their own honor and gain, and also merely on account of the fear of the law and of fear for their life, for if their reputation, honor, gain, or life were not endangered, they 
would rush without conscience into all kinds of wickedness. In the other life this is very evident from those who have been of this character in the life of the body, for there, where the interiors are 
open, they are in the perpetual endeavor to destroy others, and therefore they are in hell, where they are kept bound in a spiritual manner.  [4] That it may be further known what it is to be in external 
things, and what to be in internal things, and that they who are in external things alone cannot conceive what internal things are, and therefore cannot be affected by them (for no one is affected 
by things of which he has no conception), let us take as an example that in heaven to be least is to be greatest, and that to be humble is to be exalted; and also that to be poor and needy is to be 
rich and in abundance. They who are in external things alone cannot apprehend these things, for they think that the least cannot possibly be the greatest, nor the humble be exalted, the poor rich, or 
the needy in abundance, although in heaven this is precisely how the matter stands. And because they cannot apprehend these things they cannot be affected by them, and when from the bodily and worldly 
things in which they are, they reflect upon them, they feel an aversion for them. That such things exist in heaven they know not at all, and so long as they are in external things alone they do not 
desire to know them, nay, they cannot know them. Nevertheless in heaven the man who knows, acknowledges, and believes from the heart-that is, from affection-that he has no power from himself, but that 
all the power he has is from the Lord, is said to be the least, and yet is the greatest, because he has power from the Lord. The case is the same with the man who is humble, in that he is exalted; for 
he who is humble, acknowledging and believing from affection that he has no power of himself, no intelligence and wisdom of himself, and no good and truth of himself, is preeminently endowed by the 
Lord with power, with the intelligence of truth, and with the wisdom of good. It is the same with the poor and needy in respect to their being rich and in abundance; for he is said to be poor and needy 
who believes from his heart and from affection that he possesses nothing of himself, that he knows nothing and is wise in nothing of himself, and has no power of himself. In heaven such a man is rich 
and has abundance, for the Lord gives him all wealth, insomuch that he is wiser than all others and richer than all others, and dwells in the most magnificent palaces (n. 1116, 1626, 1627), and in 
the stores of all the riches of heaven.  [5] Take also as an example that one who is in external things alone cannot possibly comprehend that heavenly joy is to love his neighbor more than himself and 
the Lord above all things, and that happiness is according to the quantity and quality of this love; for the man who is in external things alone loves himself more than his neighbor; and if he loves 
others it is because they favor him, so that he loves them for the sake of himself, thus himself in them, and them in himself. A man of this character cannot know what it is to love others more than 
himself, and indeed he neither will nor can know it, and therefore when he is told that heaven consists in such love (n. 548) he feels an aversion for it. Hence it is that they who during their bodily 
life have been of this character cannot approach any heavenly society, for when they do so, in their aversion they cast themselves headlong into hell.  [6] As there are few at this day who know what 
it is to be in external things, and what to be in internal things, and as most people believe that they who are in internal things cannot be in external things, and the converse, I may for the sake of 
illustration adduce one more example. Take the nourishment of the body and the nourishment of the soul: one who is in merely external pleasures, makes much of himself, indulges his stomach, loves to 
live sumptuously, and makes the height of pleasure to consist in eatables and drinkables. One who is in internal things also finds pleasure in these things, but his ruling affection is to nourish his 
body with food pleasurably for the sake of its health, to the end that he may have a sound mind in a sound body, thus chiefly for the sake of the health of the mind, to which the health of the body serves 
as a means. One who is a spiritual man does not rest here, but regards the health of the mind or soul as a means for the acquisition of intelligence and wisdom - not for the sake of reputation, 
honors, and gain, but for the sake of the life after death. One who is spiritual in a more interior degree regards intelligence and wisdom as a mediate end having for its object that he may serve as a 
useful member in the Lord's kingdom; and one who is a celestial man, that he may serve the Lord. To such a one bodily food is a means for the enjoyment of spiritual food, and spiritual food is a means 
for the enjoyment of celestial food; and as they ought to serve in this manner, these foods also correspond, and are therefore called foods. Hence it is evident what it is to be in external things alone, 
and what it is to be in internal things. The Jewish and Israelitish nation, treated of in the internal historical sense of this chapter, is (with the exception of those who die in infancy) for the 
most part of the character that has been indicated, for being in avarice they, more than all others, are in external things. They who love gains and profits merely for the sake of the gold and silver, 
in the possession of which consists the sole delight of their life, are in outermost or lowest things, for the objects of their love are merely earthly; whereas they who love gold and silver for the 
sake of some use, lift themselves above earthly things according to the use. The very use that a man loves determines his life and distinguishes it from others; an evil use makes the man infernal, 
and a good use makes him heavenly-not indeed the use itself, but the love of the use, for everyone's life is in his love. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4459</b></p><p><b>4459.</b>
'Jacob's sons answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully means evil thought and intention regarding the truth and the good of the Church among the Ancients. This is clear from the representation 
of 'Shechem' as truth among the Ancients, or what amounts to the same, truth from the ancient Divine stock, dealt with in <a href="4399.htm">4399</a>, <a href="4454.htm">4454</a>; from the representation of 'Hamor' as the good from which that 
truth sprang, dealt with in <a href="4399.htm">4399</a>, <a href="4431.htm">4431</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="4454.htm">4454</a>; and from the meaning of 'deceit' as evil thought and intention. In general deceit implies evil against another and against what he says and does, for 
the thought and intention of the one who is deceitful is different from that of the other person, as is also clear from the outcome of events described in this chapter. From this it is evident that 
'the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully' means evil thought and intention regarding the truth and the good of the Church among the Ancients. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The sons of Jacob, that 
is, his descendants, could have none but an evil thought and intention regarding the truth and the good belonging to the internal man, because they were interested in external things devoid of internal, <a href="4281.htm">4281</a>, <a href="4293.htm">4293</a>, <a href="4307.htm">4307</a>, <a href="4429.htm">4429</a>, <a href="4433.htm">4433</a>. They saw no value at all in internal things, and therefore utterly despised them. Such is also the nature of that nation at the present day, and so it is of all who are 
interested only in external things. People who are interested only in external things do not even know what it is to be interested in internal things, since they have no knowledge of what is internal. 
If anyone in their presence mentions that which is internal they either endorse the existence of it because they know from doctrine of its existence, though that endorsement is attributable to their 
deceit, or else they deny the existence of it with their lips as they do in their hearts. For they do not go further than the experiences of the senses of the external man, and as a consequence do 
not believe in any life after death. Nor do they believe any resurrection to be possible apart from their rising again in the physical body. That being so, they are allowed to have these thoughts concerning 
the resurrection, or else they would not have any at all. For they centre the whole of life in the body, not knowing that the life of their body flows from the life of their spirit which lives 
after death. People who are interested only in external things cannot possibly have any faith, for external things with them annihilate all thought concerning internal ones, and consequently all belief 
in them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Since this kind of ignorance reigns at the present day, an explanation needs to be given of what it is to be interested in external things devoid of internal. All people who are devoid 
of conscience are interested only in external things, for the internal man reveals itself through conscience. Anyone is devoid of conscience if he thinks and does what is true and good not for the 
sake of what is true and good but for the sake of his own personal position and gain, and also merely because he fears the law and fears for his own life. For if reputation, position, gain, and life were 
not endangered he would plunge without conscience into every unmentionable act. This is quite evident from those in the next life who were such during their lifetime. Because interior things are laid 
bare in that life those people are constantly endeavouring to destroy others, on account of which they are in hell, where they are held in bonds in a spiritual manner. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 To enable anyone to have 
a fuller knowledge of what is meant by an interest in external things, and what by an interest in internal ones; to enable him to know also that people who are interested only in external things cannot 
have any conception of what internal ones are and so cannot feel any affection for them (for nobody feels any affection for things of which he has no conception) let the following, for example, 
be considered. One who is least in heaven is the greatest, one who is humble is exalted, and also one who is poor and needy is rich and affluent. People who are interested only in external things cannot 
have any conception of these matters, for they think that the least cannot possibly be the greatest, nor the humble be the exalted, and that the poor cannot possibly be rich or the needy affluent. 
Yet this is precisely how it is in heaven. And because they cannot have any conception of these matters they are consequently unable to feel any affection for them; and when they reflect on them from 
the point of view of the bodily and worldly things which interest them they feel an aversion to them. How it is in heaven they do not know at all, and as long as they are interested only in external things 
they do not wish to know, nor indeed are they capable of knowing. For in heaven one who knows acknowledges, and believes in his heart that is, with affection - that none of his power is self-derived, 
but that all the power he has comes from the Lord, is called the least. Yet he is the greatest because his power comes from the Lord. Similarly so with one who is humble yet exalted; for one who 
is humble, acknowledging and believing from affection that he has no self-derived power at all, nor any self-derived intelligence and wisdom, nor any goodness and truth, has power, an intelligent understanding 
of truth, and a wise discernment of good, conferred on him by the Lord more than on others. And likewise so with the poor and the needy being rich and affluent; for he is called poor and needy 
who believes in his heart and with affection that nothing he possesses begins in himself, nor does anything he knows and is wise in, nor does anything he has power in. In heaven he is rich and is 
affluent, the Lord granting him total wealth since he is wiser and richer than all others and lives in most magnificent palaces, <a href="1116.htm">1116</a>, <a href="1626.htm">1626</a>, <a href="1627.htm">1627</a>, and among the treasures constituting all the riches of 
heaven. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Take as another example someone who is interested only in external things. Such a person cannot have any conception at all that heavenly joy consists in loving the neighbour more than 
himself and the Lord above all things, and that happiness depends on the amount and the quality of that love. For one interested only in external things loves himself more than his neighbour, and if 
he does love others it is because they show him favour; and so he loves them for a selfish reason - and he therefore loves himself in them and them in himself. A person like this cannot know what loving 
others more than himself is; indeed he does not wish to know, and is incapable of knowing. Consequently when told that heaven consists in such love, <a href="548.htm">548</a>, he is repelled by the idea. Hence those who 
have been like this during their lifetime are unable to draw near any heavenly community; and winch they do draw near, because they feel repelled by it, they cast themselves down headlong into hell. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
Because few at the present day know what it is to be interested in external things and what it is to be interested in internal ones, and because the majority believe that those interested in internal 
things cannot be interested in external ones, and vice versa, let one further example be introduced to illustrate the matter. Take the nourishment of the body and the nourishment of the soul. A 
person who is interested in merely external pleasures takes care of his own skin, gratifies his stomach, likes to live sumptuously, and finds that the choicest food and drink yields him the highest pleasure. 
A person however who is interested in internal things also takes delight in those same pleasures, but his governing affection is to nourish the body with pleasurable foods so that it may be healthy, 
the end in view being a healthy mind in a healthy body. His primary concern is health of mind, for which health of the body serves as a means. One who is a spiritual man does not stop there but 
regards health of mind or of the soul as the means provided to acquire intelligence and wisdom, not for the sake of reputation, position, or gain, but for the sake of the life after death. And one who 
is spiritual in a more interior degree regards intelligence and wisdom as a mediate end enabling him to serve as a useful member in the Lord's kingdom; while one who is celestial regards the same as 
that which enables him to serve the Lord. To him bodily food is a means to the enjoyment of spiritual food; and spiritual food is a means to the enjoyment of celestial food. And because they ought to 
serve in this manner those foods also correspond, and are therefore called foods. From these examples one may see what is meant by being interested only in external things and what by being interested 
in internal ones. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 The Jewish and Israelite nation, which is the subject in this chapter in the internal historical sense, apart from those who have died as children, are for the most part such. 
They more than all others are interested in external things, for they are governed by avarice. Those who do not love profit and gain for the sake of any use, only for the sake of gold and silver, 
and who focus the whole delight of life in those possessions, dwell in the outermost or lowest places, since they are entirely earthly things which they love. But those loving gold and silver because 
of some use these may serve are people who rise above earthly things, in accordance with that use. The use itself which a person loves is what gives direction to his life and marks him off from others, 
an evil use making him like one in hell and a good use like one in heaven. It is not indeed the use itself that does so but the love behind it, for everyone's life is inherent in his love. </p>

`Responderunt filii Jacobi Shechemo et Hamori patri illius in fraude': quod significet malam opinionem et intentionem de vero et bono Ecclesiae apud antiquos, constat a repraesentatione `Shechemi' quod 
sit verum apud antiquos, seu quod idem, verum ex antiqua Divina stirpe, de qua n. 4399, 4454; ex repraesentatione `Hamoris' quod sit bonum ex quo illud verum, de qua n. 4399, 4431, 4447, 4454; 
et ex significatione `fraudis' quod sit mala opinio et intentio; fraus enim in genere involvit malum contra alterum, et contra illa quae loquitur et quae agit, nam qui in fraude est, cogitat et intendit 
diversum ab altero, quod etiam ab effectu, de quo in hoc capite, constat; inde patet quod per `responderunt filii Jacobi Shechemo et Hamori patri illius in fraude' significetur mala opinio et 
intentio de vero et bono Ecclesiae apud antiquos.  [2] Filii Jacobi, seu posteri illius, non aliam opinionem et intentionem habere potuerunt de vero et bono interni hominis quam malam, quia in externis 
fuerunt absque internis, n. 4281, 3293, 4307, 4429, 4433; et quoque interna nihili {1} fecerunt et ideo (o)illa prorsus contempserunt: talis quoque est gens illa hodie; et tales (o)sunt omnes 
qui solum in externis sunt; qui in solis externis sunt, ne quidem sciunt quid sit esse in internis, nam non sciunt quid internum; si quis coram illis nominat internum, vel affirmant quod sit quia 
(t)ex doctrinali norunt esse, sed tunc affirmant ex fraude, vel sicut corde etiam ore negant; non enim vadunt ultra sensualia quae sunt externi hominis; inde est quod non credant aliquam vitam post 
mortem, et nisi corpore resurrecturos esse `non dari posse resurrectionem, quapropter permissum est ut talem opinionem de resurrectione habeant, alioquin nullam habuissent, nam ponunt omne vitae 
in corpore, nescientes quod vita corporis eorum sit ex vita eorum spiritus qui post mortem vivit.  Qui in solis externis sunt, nusquam aliam fidem possunt habere, nam externa apud illos exstinguunt 
omne cogitationis, proinde omne fidei, de internis. [3] Quia talis ignorantia hodie regnat, dicendum est quid sit esse in externis absque internis: qui absque conscientia sunt, omnes illi in solis 
externis sunt, nam internus homo per conscientiam se manifestat; et omnes illi nullam conscientiam habent, qui verum et bonum cogitant et faciunt non propter verum et bonum, sed propter se, sui honoris 
et lucri causa {3}, et quoque qui solum propter timorem legis ac vitae, nam si non periclitaretur fama, honor, lucrum, vita, ruerent absque conscientia in omnia nefaria: hoc patet manifeste ab 
illis in altera vita qui tales fuerunt in vita corporis; ibi quia interiora patent, in perpetuo conatu sunt perdendi alios, quapropter in inferno sunt, (c)et ibi spirituali modo vincti tenentur {4}. 
 [4] (s)Ut adhuc sciatur quid sit {5} in externis esse et quid in internis, et quod qui in (o)solis externis sunt, non capere possint quid interna, proinde non (o)possunt his affici, nam nemo afficitur illis 
quae non capit, sit pro exemplo, quod minimus esse sit maximus esse in caelo, et quod humilis sit altus esse, tum quod pauper et egenus sit dives et abundans esse: qui in solis externis sunt, 
ii haec non capere possunt, cogitant enim quod minimus nusquam possit maximus esse, nec humilis altus, et pauper dives ac egenus abundans; cum tamen prorsus ita se habet in caelo; et quia non 
capere possunt, inde nec affici possunt illis, et cum reflectunt super illa ex corporeis et mundanis in quibus sunt, aversantur illa; quod ita se habeat in caelo, prorsus non sciunt, et quamdiu 
in solis externis sunt, non {6} scire volunt {7}, immo nec scire possunt {7}; in caelo enim qui {8} scit, agnoscit, credit ex corde, hoc est, ex affectione, quod nihil potentiae (c)ex semet sit, 
sed quod omne potentiae ei a Domino, is minimus dicitur et tamen est maximus quia ei potentia a Domino est; similiter se habet cum illo qui humilis est, quod sit aliis, nam qui humilis est, agnoscens 
et credens ex affectione quod nihil potentiae ei sit a se, nihil intelligentiae et sapientiae a se, et nihil boni et veri a se, is donatur potentia, intelligentia veri, et sapientia boni prae aliis 
a Domino; pariter quod pauper et egenus sit dives et abundans; pauper enim' et egenus dicitur qui credit ex corde et affectione quod nihil possideat ex se, nihil sciat et sapiat ex se et nihil 
possit ex se; is in caelo dives est et abundat, Dominus enim illi dat omnem opulentiam, sapiens enim est prae reliquis, et dives est prae reliquis, in magnificentissimis habitat palatiis, n. 1116, 
1626, 1627, ac in thesauris omnium divitiarum caeli.  [5] Sit quoque pro exemplo, qui iri solis externis est: nequaquam capere potest quod gaudium caeleste sit proximum amare prae se et Dominum supra 
omnia, et quod secundum amoris illius quantum et quale sit felicitas; nam qui in solis externis est, se amat prae proximo, et si amat alios, est quia sibi favent, et ita amat illos sui causa, proinde 
se in illis et illos in se; qui talis est, non scire potest quid sit amare alios prae se, immo non {6} scire vult {9}, nec scire potest {9}, quare cum dicitur ei quod caelum consistat in tali 
amore, n. 548, aversatur illud; inde est quod qui tales fuerunt in vita corporis, non approximare possint ad aliquam societatem caelestem, et cum approximant, quod propter aversationem dejiciant 
se praecipites in infernum.  [6] Quia pauci hodie sciunt quid sit in externis esse et quid in internis, et quia plerique credunt quod qui in internis sunt, non possint esse in externis, et vicissim, 
licet illustrationis causa adhuc unum exemplum afferre: </p>
<p>sit nutritio corporis et nutritio animae; qui in voluptatibus mere externis est, is curat pelliculam, indulget stomacho, amat opipare vivere, 
et in eduliis ac nectareis ponit summum voluptatis; at qui in internis est, etiam volupe habet in illis, sed ejus affectio regnans est ut corpus nutriatur cibis cum voluptate propter sanitatem ejus, 
ob finem ut `mens sana sit in corpore sano,' ita principaliter propter mentis sanitatem, cui sanitas corporis inservit pro medio; qui spiritualis homo est, non ibi quiescit, sed sanitatem mentis 
seu animae spectat ut medium ad imbuendum intelligentiam et sapientiam, non propter famam, honores, lucrum, sed propter vitam post mortem; qui in interiore gradu spiritualis est, is intelligentiam 
et sapientiam spectat ut finem medium ut (o)is servire possit pro membro utili in regno Domini; et qui caelestis homo est, ut serviat Domino; huic cibus corporeus est medium ad fruendum cibo spirituali, 
et {10} cibus spiritualis est medium ad fruendum cibo caelesti {10}; et quia ita inservire debent, etiam cibi illi correspondent; inde etiam vocantur cibi.  Ex his constare potest quid sit 
in solis externis esse, et quid in internis.(s)   [7] Gens Judaica (o)et Israelitica, de qua in hoc capite in sensu interno historico agitur, praeter illos qui mortui sunt infantes, quoad perplurimam 
partem talis est, sunt enim prae omnibus aliis in externis, nam sunt in avaritia; qui lucra et quaestus amant non propter alium usum quam propter aurum et argentum, et in illis possidendis omne 
vitae jucundum ponunt, in extimis seu infimis sunt, quippe prorsus terrestria sunt quae amant; qui autem aurum et argentum propter aliquem usum amant, illi secundum usum a terrestribus se elevant; 
ipse usus quem homo amat, determinat vitam ejus, et distinguit ab aliis, usus malus facit illum infernalem, usus bonus facit illum caelestem; non quidem ipse usus, sed amor usus, nam in amore est 
vita cujusvis.      @1 nihil$      @2 nullam$      @3 i et famae inde$      @4 A d tenentur$      @5 fit I$      @6 nec$      @7 A transposes volunt and possunt$      @8 i ita se habet$      
@9 A transposes$      @10 A i qui est intelligentia, quae fidei, but d quae fidei. After cibo caelesti A i but d qui est sapientia quae amoris.  Probably both phrases were to be omitted as in I, not 
because incorrect, but as unnecessary here.$ </p>
