<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7786节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7786.</strong>“好叫你们知道耶和华是将埃及人和以色列分别出来”表好让人人皆知那些沉浸于虚假的人与那些处于良善的人有什么不同。这从“知道”的含义，以及“埃及人”和“色列人”的代表清楚可知：“知道”是指让人人皆知；“埃及人”是指那些沉浸于邪恶的人，之前“埃及人”表示那些沉浸于虚假的人，但现在他们已经在他们所知的教会真理方面经历了荒凉，故他们表示那些沉浸于邪恶的人，因为“长子的死亡”表示诅咒，就是邪恶的状态；“以色列人”是指那些属于属灵教会的人，如前所述（<a href="7784.htm">7784</a>节），因而是指那些处于良善的人，因为那些属于属灵良善的人通过信被引向仁，因而通过真理被引向良善。</p>

That ye may know that Jehovah doth separate between the Egyptians and Israel. That this signifies that it may be known what is the difference between those who are in evil and those who are in good, 
is evident from the signification of "knowing," as being to be known; from the representation of the Egyptians, as being those who are in evil (by "the Egyptians" were before signified those who are in 
falsity, but now, after they have been vastated in respect to the truths of the church which they knew, they signify those who are in evil, for by the death of the firstborn is signified damnation, 
which is a state of evil); and from the representation of the sons of Israel, as being those who are of the spiritual church (see above, n. 7784), thus those who are in good; for they who are of the spiritual 
church are led by means of faith to charity, thus by means of truth to good. </p>

'So that you may know that Jehovah makes a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel' means so that the nature of the difference between those immersed in evil and those governed by good may be known. 
This is clear from the meaning of 'knowing' as being made known; from the representation of 'the Egyptians' as those immersed in evil (previously 'the Egyptians' meant those steeped in falsity, but 
now that they have undergone vastation of the Church's truths which they knew they mean those immersed in evil; for 'the death of the firstborn' means damnation, a state of evil); and from the representation 
of 'the children of Israel' as those who belong to the spiritual Church, dealt with above in <a href="7784.htm">7784</a>, thus those who are governed by good, since those who belong to the spiritual Church are led 
through faith to charity, that is, through truth to good. </p>

</p><b>7786.</b>
`Propterea ut sciatis quod discernat Jehovah inter Aegyptios et inter Israelem': quod significet ut notum sit quale discrimen fit inter illos qui in malo et qui in bono, constat ex significatione `scire' 
quod sit notum esse; ex repraesentatione `Aegyptiorum' quod sint qui in malo; per `Aegyptios' prius significati sunt qui in falso {1}, nunc autem postquam {2}vastati sunt quoad Ecclesiae vera quae 
sciverunt, per illos significantur qui in malo; per `mortem' enim `primogenitorum' significatur damnatio, quae est status mali; et ex repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis' quod sint qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, 
de qua supra n. 7784, ita qui in bono; nam qui ab Ecclesia spirituali sunt per fidem ducuntur ad charitatem, ita per verum ad bonum. 	@1 i ex malo$ 	@2 quoad illa quae Ecclesiae vera faciunt, 
vastati sunt, significantur per illos qui in malo$ </p>
