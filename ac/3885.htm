<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3885节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3885.</strong>还有一次，当我从源于身体感官印象的观念中退出时，天堂之光向我显现。这光使我远离这些观念，因为天堂之光中含有属灵生命在里面（参看<a href="1524.htm">1524</a>，<a href="2776.htm">2776</a>，<a href="3167.htm">3167</a>，<a href="3195.htm">3195</a>，<a href="3339.htm">3339</a>，<a href="3636.htm">3636</a>，<a href="3643.htm">3643</a>节） 。当我被这光包围时，肉体和世俗的兴趣看上去像是在我下面。我仍能意识到它们，只是觉得它们离我更远了，仿佛不属于我。这时，我觉得自己好像脑袋在天堂，身子却不在天堂。在这种状态下，我还得以发觉天堂的普遍呼吸及其性质。它是内在、放松和自发的，并以三比一的比率对应于我自己的呼吸（即天堂呼吸三次，我呼吸一次）。我又同样的方式发现，我的心跳回应天堂的心跳。这时，天使告诉我，地上每一个生物的心跳和肺呼吸都是从天堂中的这些相应运动发出的。他们还说，没有哪两种心跳或肺呼吸的频率是一样的。其原因在于，在天堂，心跳和肺呼吸扩散进入某种连续事物，从而进入一种努力；这种努力具有这样的性质，它在这些生物中产生各种不同的运动，这些变化取决于各自的具体状态。</p>

Once also when I was withdrawn from the ideas derived from the sensuous things of the body, a heavenly light appeared to me, and that light itself withdrew me farther from them, for in the light of heaven 
there is spiritual life (see n. 1524, 2776, 3167, 3195, 3339, 3636, 3643). When I was in this light, corporeal and worldly things appeared as beneath me, and yet I still perceived them, but as more 
remote from me, and as not belonging to me. I then seemed to myself to be in heaven with my head, but not with my body. In this state it was likewise given me to observe the general respiration of 
heaven, and what was its nature; it was interior, easy, spontaneous, and corresponding to my respiration as three to one. It was also given me to observe the reciprocations of the pulsations of the heart; 
and I was then informed by angels that each and every creature on the earth has pulsations of the heart and the consequent respirations; and that the reason why they take place at dissimilar moments 
is that both the cardiac pulsation and the pulmonary respiration which are in the heavens pass off into something continuous, and thus into endeavor, which is of such a nature as to excite these 
motions variously in accordance with the state of every subject. </p>

On another occasion also when I was led away from ideas formed from sensory impressions in the body a heavenly light appeared to me. That light led me even further away from those ideas, for the light 
of heaven holds spiritual life within it, see <a href="1524.htm">1524</a>, <a href="2776.htm">2776</a>, <a href="3167.htm">3167</a>, <a href="3195.htm">3195</a>, <a href="3339.htm">3339</a>, <a href="3636.htm">3636</a>, <a href="3643.htm">3643</a>. While I was surrounded with this light bodily and worldly interests looked to be underneath me. I was still aware 
of them, but it seemed as though they were more remote from me and did not belong to me. At this time it seemed to me as though I was present in heaven with my head but not with my body. In this condition 
I was also allowed to observe the general breathing of heaven and also the nature of it. It was interior, relaxed, spontaneous, and corresponded to my own breathing in a ratio of three breaths 
to one. In a similar way I was also allowed to observe my heartbeats complementing those of heaven. At this point the angels told me that the beating of the heart and the breathing of the lungs in each 
individual being on earth sprang from those corresponding actions in heaven. They also said that the reason why one heart beats or a pair of lungs breathes at a different rate from another is that 
the beat of the heart and the breathing of the lungs in heaven is spread out into a kind of continuum and so into an endeavour whose nature is such that it gives rise to those varying motions in living 
beings, the variations in each one depending on its particular state. </p>

Quondam etiam cum abducerer ab ideis quae a sensualibus corporis, apparebat mihi lux caelestis, ipsa illa lux abduxit me magis ab illis {1}, nam luci caeli spiritualis vita inest, videatur n. 1524, 
2776, 3167, 3195, 3339, 3636, 3643; in qua cum essem, apparebant corporea et mundana sicut infra me, quae tamen usque appercipiebam sed sicut remotiora a me, et ad me non pertinentia; </p>
