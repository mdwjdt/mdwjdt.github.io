<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>436.</strong>她取名为“塞特”的“儿子”表一个新的信，由此而得仁，这一点从前面所述、以及它与身上被“立了一个记号，免得被人杀”的该隐相关明显可知。目前来看，一系列含义如下：“该隐”表从爱分离之信；“亚伯”表仁；该隐杀亚伯表分离之信灭绝了仁。耶和华给该隐立一个记号，免得人杀他，表信的保存，以便主可以由此植入仁。亚大所生的雅八，表后来主通过信赐予爱和源于它的善之神圣；他的兄弟犹八，表赐予信的属灵之物；洗拉所生的土八该隐表出自属天和属灵的属世良善与真理。这最后两节总结和概括了所有这些问题；“人与他的妻子”表之前被称为“亚大和洗拉”的新教会，“塞特”表一个新的信，仁由此被植入；在下一节中，“以挪士”表通过信被植入的仁。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]436.</strong> The symbolism of their son, whose name she called Seth, as a new faith that will allow charity to take hold can be seen from statements made earlier{*1} and from the verse saying that Cain had a mark placed on him to prevent his murder [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_436/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_392" target=_top>392</a>].<br />The chain of events is this: Faith that had detached from love was symbolized by Cain, charity by Abel. This detached faith put an end to charity, as symbolized by Cain's murder of Abel. Faith was preserved to enable the Lord to instill charity by means of it, as symbolized by Jehovah's putting a mark on Cain to keep anyone from killing him. Afterward, it was by means of faith that the Lord endowed people with holy love and the goodness that comes from it, symbolized by Jabal, who was born to Adah. He also granted them the spiritual gift of faith, symbolized by Jabal's brother Jubal. And through these he imparted earthly goodness and truth, symbolized by Tubal-cain, who was born to Zillah. These two verses bring the story to a close and so sum up the state of affairs, which is that the human and his wife symbolize the new church previously referred to as Adah and Zillah; Seth symbolizes faith, through which charity is implanted; and, in the next verse, Enosh symbolizes the charity implanted through faith.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Though Swedenborg refers to Seth as a new faith in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_436/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_335" target=_top>335</a>, he apparently intended the text of the present section to provide the full explanation.

That by her "son" whom she named Seth, is signified a new faith, by which charity may be attained, is evident from what has been previously stated, as well as from its being related of Cain that a "mark 
was set upon him, lest anyone should slay him." For the subject as it stands in a series is as follows: Faith separated from love was signified by "Cain;" charity, by "Abel;" and that faith in its 
separated state extinguished charity, was signified by Cain slaying Abel. The preservation of faith in order that charity might be thereby implanted by the Lord, was signified by Jehovah's setting a 
mark on Cain lest anyone should slay him. That afterwards the Holy of love and the good thence derived were given by the Lord through faith, was signified by Jabal whom Adah bare; and that the spiritual 
of faith was given, was signified by his brother Jubal; and that from these there came natural good and truth was signified by Tubal-Cain whom Zillah bare. In these two concluding verses of Genesis 
4 we have the conclusion, and thus the summary, of all these matters, to this effect, that by the "man and his wife" is signified that new church which before was called Adah and Zillah, and that by 
"Seth" is signified the faith through which charity is implanted; and in the verse which now follows, by "Enosh" is signified the charity that is implanted through faith. </p>

'Her son whose name she called Seth' means new faith, through which charity may be received. This is clear from what has been stated already and also from where Cain is spoken of as having 'a sign placed 
on him lest anyone should kill him'. In the present context the meaning is this: Faith separated from love was meant by 'Cain', charity by 'Abel'. The annihilation of charity by separated faith was 
meant by Cain's killing Abel, and the preservation of faith, for the reason that through it charity could be implanted by the Lord, was meant by the statement about 'Jehovah putting a sign on Cain 
lest anyone should kill him'. After that, the Lord's conferment, through faith, of the holiness of love, and of good deriving from it, was meant by 'Jabal whom Adah bore'; and the conferment of the spiritual 
manifestation of faith by 'his brother Jubal'; and the existence of natural good and truth from these is meant by 'Tubal-cain whom Zillah bore'. These two verses conclude and so summarize all 
these matters; 'the man and his wife' means that new Church which was earlier on called Adah and Zillah, while Seth means faith through which charity is implanted. In the next verse Enosh means charity 
that has been implanted through faith.  </p>

</p><b>436.</b>
Quod per 'filium ejus, cujus nomen vocavit Sheth' significetur nova fides per quam charitas, constat ab illis quae prius dicta sunt; tum ubi de Caino quod 'ei impositum sit signum, ne quis eum occideret': 
res enim in serie sic se habet: fides separata ab amore significata est per 'Cainum'; charitas per 'Habelem'; quod fides separata exstinxerit charitatem, significatum est per 'Cainum, quod occiderit 
Habelem'; et quod fides conservaretur ob causam quod per illam implantari a Domino posset charitas, significatum est per id 'quod Jehovah posuerit Caino signum, ne quis eum occideret'; quod postea 
per fidem a Domino donatum sit sanctum amoris et bonum inde, significatum per 'Jabal quem peperit Adah'; et quod spirituale fidei, significatum per 'fratrem ejus Jubal'; et quod ex illis naturale bonum 
et verum, per 'Tubal-cain, quem peperit Zillah'; in binis his versibus est conclusio, ita summa rerum, quae talis est quod per 'hominem et ejus uxorem' significetur nova illa Ecclesia, 'Adah et Zillah' 
prius vocata; et per 'Shethum' fides per quam implantatur charitas, in sequente versu per 'Enosh' charitas implantata per fidem. </p>
