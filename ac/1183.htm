<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1183节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1183.</strong>“以力、亚甲、甲尼，都在示拿地”的具体含义不是很清楚，因为除了甲尼（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩6.2.htm">6:2</a>）外，这些名字在圣言中再没有提及；不过，他们是指这类敬拜的各种形式。至于具有这些敬拜的示拿地，在圣言中，它表其中含有亵渎之物的外在敬拜，这从它在下一章（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创11.2.htm">11:2</a>），以及撒迦利亚书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚5.11.htm">5:11</a>），尤其但以理书中的含义明显可知，那里出现了这些话：<br />主将犹大王约雅敬，并神殿中器皿的几份交付巴别王尼布甲尼撒的手；他就把这器皿带到示拿地，收入他神的庙里，放在他神的宝库中。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但1.2.htm">1:2</a>）<br />这表示神圣事物遭到亵渎：“神殿中的器皿”表神圣事物；“巴别王在示拿地的神庙”表神圣事物被带入其中的亵渎之物。尽管这些都是历史事件，但它们仍包含这些奥秘，和圣言的所有历史事件一样。这个问题从对相同器皿（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但5.3.htm">5:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但5.5.htm">5</a>）的亵渎更清楚地看出来。若这些事件不代表神圣事物，它们绝不会发生。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1183.</strong> It is not as easy to understand the specific symbolism of Erech, Accad, Calneh, in the land of Shinar, since the Word does not mention them anywhere else (aside from a reference to Calneh in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1183/bible_king-james-version_amos_6_2" target=_top>Amos 6:2</a>),{*1} but they are different varieties of this worship.<br />As for the land of Shinar, where these types of worship existed, though, its symbolism in the Word as external devotion that is profane at its core can be seen from its symbolism in verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1183/bible_king-james-version_genesis_10_2" target=_top>2</a> of the next chapter, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1183/bible_king-james-version_genesis_11_1-32" target=_top>Genesis 11</a>.{*2} It can also be seen in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1183/bible_king-james-version_zechariah_5_11" target=_top>Zechariah 5:11</a>{*3} and still more clearly in Daniel, where these words appear:<br />Into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, the Lord gave Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and a portion of the vessels of the House of God. And he carried them into the land of Shinar, into the house of his god, and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1183/bible_king-james-version_daniel_1_2" target=_top>Daniel 1:2</a>)<br />The meaning of these words is that holy things were profaned. The vessels of the House of God are the holy things. The house of the god of Babylon's king in the land of Shinar is the profane places where the holy things were brought. Although the details are historically true, they still harbor these secret meanings, as all the historical details of the Word do. The symbolism of Shinar is demonstrated further in the profanation of the same vessels, as told about in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1183/bible_king-james-version_daniel_5_3" target=_top>Daniel 5:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1183/bible_king-james-version_daniel_5_4" target=_top>4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1183/bible_king-james-version_daniel_5_5" target=_top>5</a>.{*4} If the vessels had not represented holy attributes, these events would never have happened.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Erech, located in southeastern Iraq, was one of the greatest cities of Sumerian civilization. Accad, or more commonly Akkad, was a city and surrounding region in northern Babylonia, which reached its pinnacle under King Sargon I in the 23rd century b.c.e. The identity of Calneh is disputed, and some scholars believe the Calneh referred to in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1183/bible_king-james-version_amos_6_2" target=_top>Amos 6:2</a> is another city altogether from the one cited in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1183/bible_king-james-version_genesis_10_10" target=_top>Genesis 10:10</a>. Shinar was most likely a general term for Babylonia. [RS, SS]<br />{*2} <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1183/bible_king-james-version_genesis_11_2" target=_top>Genesis 11:2</a> speaks of the valley in the land of Shinar where the tower of Babel was built. For the symbolism, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1183/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1292" target=_top>1292</a>.

[LHC]<br />{*4} <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1183/bible_king-james-version_daniel_5_3-5" target=_top>Daniel 5:3-5</a> says that Nebuchadnezzar's son Belshazzar brought out the Temple dishes previously mentioned so that he and his court could drink toasts to their gods. A hand then appeared and wrote a message of doom on the wall. [LHC] </p>

What is signified in particular by "Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar," cannot so well be seen, because they are not mentioned in other parts of the Word, except Calneh (in Amos 6:2) but 
they are varieties of such worship. But as regards the land of Shinar in which these worships were, that external worship wherein is what is profane is signified by it in the Word is evident from its 
signification in the following chapter (Gen. 11:2), and also in Zechariah 5:11; and, especially in Daniel, where these words occur: </p>
<p>     The Lord gave Jehoiakim, king of Judah, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, 
king of Babel, with part of the vessels of the house of God, and he carried them into the land of Shinar, into the house of his god and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his 
god (Dan. 1:2), by which is signified that holy things were profaned: "the vessels of the house of God," are holy things; "the house of the god of Babel, in the land of Shinar," is profane things, 
into which the holy things were brought. Although these incidents are historical, yet they involve these arcana, as do all the historical facts of the Word. The same is further evident from the profanation 
of the same vessels (Dan. 5:3-5). If sacred things had not been represented by them, no such events would have taken place. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1183</b></p><p><b>1183.</b>
The specific meaning of 'Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar' is not so clear because, with the exception of Calneh in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%206:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 6:2</a>, these names are not mentioned anywhere else in the Word; but 
they are different forms of such worship. As for the land of Shinar however in which these forms of worship existed, it is clear that in the Word it means external worship which has within it that 
which is unholy. This is clear from its meaning in verse 2 of the next chapter, also in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zechariah%205:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zechariah 5:11</a>, and especially in Daniel, where the following words appear,	 </p>
<blockquote>
The Lord gave Jehoiakim king of 
Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babel, and part of the vessels of the house of God; and he took them away into the land of Shinar, into the house of his god, and he brought the vessels 
into the house of the treasury of his god. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%201:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 1:2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This reference means that holy things were profaned. 'The vessels of the house of God' are holy things, 'the house of the god of the king of Babel 
in the land of Shinar' the unholy into which the holy were brought. Although these are historical events they nevertheless embody those arcana within them, as do all the historical narratives of the 
Word. The matter is made clearer still by the profanation of the same vessels, referred to in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Daniel%205:3-5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Daniel 5:3-5</a>. Unless those events had represented holy things they would never have taken place. </p>

Quid per {1}Erech, Accad, Calneh, in terra Shinar' in specie significatur, non ita constare potest quia in Verbo alibi non memorantur, praeter Calneh, apud Amos vi 2, sed sunt differentia talis cultus. 
 Quod autem terram Shinar attinet in qua hi cultus, quod per eam in Verbo significetur cultus externus in quo profanum, constat a significatione ejus in cap. seq. xi vers. 2, tum etiam apud Zachariam, 
v 11, imprimis apud Danielem, ubi haec, Dedit Dominus in manum Nebuchadnezzaris, regis Babelis, Jehoiakimum regem Jehudae, et partem vasorum domus Dei, et deduxit eos in terram Shinar, in domum 
dei sui, et vasa intulit in domum thesauri dei sui, i 2; </p>
<p>per quae significatur quod sancta profanata; 'vasa domus Dei' sunt sancta; 'domus dei regis Babelis in terra Shinar' sunt profana in quae sancta 
illata sunt; haec tametsi historica sunt, usque involvunt arcana illa, sicut omnia historica Verbi; et porro constat ex profanatione eorundem vasorum, apud Danielem v 3-5, per quae nisi sancta repraesentata 
fuissent, nusquam talia contigissent. @1 'It is remarkable that in archaeology Erech and Accad are the places most frequently mentioned in the history of Babylon.  According to the Septuagint 
Calneh was the site of the town of Babel.  It is thought to be identical with Calno (Is. x 9).$ </p>
