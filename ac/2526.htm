<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2526节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2526.</strong>“我做这事是手洁的”表出于对真理的情感，因而出于使人如此思想的全部能力。这从“洁”和“手”的含义清楚可知。在原文，“洁”也是用表示洁净、纯洁的词来表述的。“手”论及真理，表示力量，因而表示如此思想的一种能力（<a href="878.htm">878</a>节）。“我做这事是心正手洁的”表示这种想法是出于纯真简单的良善，出于对真理的情感，因而出于如此思想的全部能力。其原因在于，正是纯真使得良善成为良善，正是良善使得真理成为真理。当这些按其适当次序存在时，如此思想的全部能力也就存在了。显然，这些事物就体现在这些话中。因为表示良善的正直、健全或完美的心是不存在的，除非纯真在良善中，如刚才所述，由此使其成为简单的良善。论及真理的纯洁、洁净的手是不存在的，除非良善在真理中，也如刚才所述，即除非对真理的情感存在。思维来自这些事物时，也就来自如此思想的全部能力或力量，能力或力量同样由“手”来表示（<a href="878.htm">878</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2526</b></p><p><b>2526.</b>
And in the blamelessness of my hands have I done this. That this signifies from the affection of truth, and so from all ability, is evident from the signification of "blamelessness," and also of "hands." 
In the original language "blamelessness" is expressed by a word which also means cleanness and purity. "Hands" are predicated of truth, and signify power, thus ability (n. 878). That "I have done 
this from the uprightness of my heart and the blamelessness of my hands" signifies that it was so thought from innocence and simple good, and from the affection of truth, and thus from all ability, is 
because good is good from innocence; and truth is truth from good; and when these are in their order, there is then all ability. That these things are involved in the words is plain; for there is not 
an upright, sound, or perfect heart (by which good is signified) unless innocence be in the good, as just said; from this it becomes simple good. And there are not blameless, clean, or pure hands (which 
are predicated of truths) unless good be in the truths, as also just said; that is, unless there be the affection of truth. When the thought is from these, it is also from all ability or power; which 
is likewise signified by "hands" (n. 878). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2526</b></p><p><b>2526.</b>
'And in the blamelessness of my hands have I done this' means the product of the affection for truth and thus of all that enables one so to think. This is clear from the meaning of 'blamelessness' and 
also of 'hands'. The original language expresses 'blamelessness' by means of a word which also means cleanliness and purity. 'Hands' has reference to truth and means power, and thus means an ability 
so to think, <a href="878.htm">878</a>. The reason why 'in the uprightness of my heart and in the blamelessness of my hands have I done this' therefore means that such thinking had been the product of innocence and simple 
good, and of the affection for truth, and thus of an entire ability so to think, is that it is innocence which causes good to be good, and good which causes truth to be truth. And when these are present 
in their proper order an entire ability so to think is present too. It is evident that these things are embodied in these words, for an upright or whole or perfect heart, which means good, does not 
exist unless innocence lies within the good, as stated, thereby making it simple good. And blameless or clean or pure hands, which has reference to truths, do not exist unless good is contained within 
the truths, as has also been stated, that is, unless the affection for truth exists. When thinking is a product of these it is also a product of an entire ability or power so to think, which is likewise 
meant by the hands, <a href="878.htm">878</a>. </p>

</p><b>2526.</b>
`Et in immunitate manuum mearum feci hoc': quod significet ex affectione veri et sic ex omni facultate, constat ex significatione `immunitatis,' tum `manuum'; immunitas in lingua originali exprimitur 
per vocem quae etiam significat munditiam {1} et puritatem; `manus' praedicantur de vero, et significant potentiam, ita facultatem, n. 878.  Quod itaque `ex rectitudine cordis et immunitate manuum feci 
hoc' significent quod cogitatum ex innocentia et simplici bono, et ex affectione veri, sic ex omni facultate, inde est quia ex innocentia bonum est bonum, et ex bono verum est verum, quae cum insunt 
suo ordine, tunc est omnis facultas; quod haec involvantur illis verbis, patet, nam rectum seu integrum aut perfectum cor, quo significatur bonum, non est nisi innocentia sit in bono, ut dictum, inde 
fit simplex bonum; ac immunes seu mundae aut purae manus, quae praedicantur de veris, non sunt nisi bonum sit in veris, ut quoque dictum, hoc est, nisi sit affectio veri; cum ex his, etiam est ex omni 
facultate seu potentia, quae quoque per manus significatur, n. 878. 	@1 munditiem.$ </p>
