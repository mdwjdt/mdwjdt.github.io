<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9306节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9306.</strong>“你们要在他面前谨慎”表神圣的敬畏。这从“在面前谨慎”的含义清楚可知，“在面前谨慎”当论及此处“使者”所表示的主时，是指害怕，唯恐祂由于邪恶而发怒，或由于过犯而被惹动，如下文所述。害怕这些事就是神圣的敬畏，关于这种敬畏，可参看前文（<a href="2826.htm">2826</a>，<a href="3718.htm">3718</a>，<a href="3719.htm">3719</a>，<a href="5459.htm">5459</a>，<a href="5534.htm">5534</a>，<a href="7280.htm">7280</a>，<a href="7788.htm">7788</a>，<a href="8816.htm">8816</a>，<a href="8925.htm">8925</a>节）。经上之所以说“在他面前谨慎”，是因为“面”表示构成一个人生命的内层事物，因而表示他的思维和情感，尤其他的信和爱。原因在于，脸是照着人之内层的形像而成形的，好叫那些属于内在人的事物能显现于外在人；因而那些属于灵界的事物能在自然界变得可见，从而对一个人的邻舍产生影响。众所周知，脸会将一个人的所思所爱呈现为可见的形式，或仿佛呈现在一面镜子中。诚实人的脸，尤其是天使的脸就是这样（参看<a href="1999.htm">1999</a>，<a href="2434.htm">2434</a>，<a href="3527.htm">3527</a>，<a href="3573.htm">3573</a>，<a href="4066.htm">4066</a>，<a href="4326.htm">4326</a>，<a href="4796.htm">4796</a>-<a href="4799.htm">4799</a>，<a href="5102.htm">5102</a>，<a href="5695.htm">5695</a>，<a href="6604.htm">6604</a>，<a href="8248.htm">8248</a>-<a href="8250.htm">8250</a>节）。所以在原文，“脸”是一个通用术语，用来描述存在并显现于一个人里面的情感，如感激、赞成、仁爱、乐于助人或善良，以及无情、愤怒或报复。正因如此，在原文，当这个词与另一个词搭配时，它表示“在旁边”、“和”（with）、“在前面”、“在面前”、“为了”，以及“反对”，因而表示凡在此人自己里面，来自他自己、为了他自己或反对他自己的东西；因为如前所述，“脸”就是一个人真实的自己，或存在于一个人里面并显现出来的东西。<br />由此可知，“耶和华的面”或“使者的面”表示什么，此处使者是指就其神性人身而言的主，即：神性之爱的神性良善和从这神性良善发出的神性真理；因为这些就住在耶和华或主里面，它们来自祂，其实就是祂自己（<a href="222.htm">222</a>，<a href="223.htm">223</a>，<a href="5585.htm">5585</a>节）。由此明显可知，在以下祝福中，“耶和华的脸”表示什么：<br />愿耶和华使祂的脸光照你，怜悯你。愿耶和华向你仰脸，赐你平安。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民6.25.htm">6:25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民6.26.htm">26</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />愿神怜悯我们，赐福与我们，用脸光照我们。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗67.1.htm">67:1</a>）<br />类似情况可见于诗篇（<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗80.3.htm">80:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗80.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗80.19.htm">19</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗119.135.htm">119:135</a>）、但以理书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/但9.17.htm">9:17</a>）和其它地方。<br />正因如此，在以赛亚书，主的神性人身被称为“耶和华面前的使者”：<br />我要提起耶和华的怜悯。祂要照祂的怜悯，照祂丰盛的怜悯赏赐他们；于是，祂就作了他们的救主。祂面前的使者拯救他们；祂以慈爱和怜悯救赎他们。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.7.htm">63:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.9.htm">9</a>）<br />主的神性人身之所以被称为“耶和华面前的使者”，是因为神性人身就是脸上，也就是外在形式上的神性本身，主在约翰福音也教导了这一点：<br />你们若认识我，也就认识我的父。从今以后，你们认识祂，并且已经看见祂。腓力说，将父显给我们看。耶稣对他说，腓力，我与你们同在这样长久，你还不认识我吗？人看见了我，就是看见了父。我在父里面，父在我里面。你们当信我，我在父里面，父在我里面。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.7.htm">14:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.11.htm">11</a>）<br />“耶和华（或主）的脸”也表示怒气、报复、惩罚和灾祸，因为简单人出于万物皆来自神的普遍观念，以为灾祸，尤其惩罚的灾祸也来自祂。由于这个原因，根据这个普遍观念，以及表象，怒气、报复、惩罚、灾祸都归给了耶和华或主；而事实上，它们并非来源于主，而是来源于人、关于这个主题，可参看前文（<a href="1861.htm">1861</a>，<a href="2447.htm">2447</a>，<a href="5798.htm">5798</a>，<a href="6071.htm">6071</a>，<a href="6832.htm">6832</a>，<a href="6991.htm">6991</a>，<a href="6997.htm">6997</a>，<a href="7533.htm">7533</a>，<a href="7632.htm">7632</a>，<a href="7877.htm">7877</a>，<a href="7926.htm">7926</a>，<a href="8197.htm">8197</a>，<a href="8227.htm">8227</a>，<a href="8228.htm">8228</a>，<a href="8282.htm">8282</a>，<a href="8483.htm">8483</a>，<a href="8632.htm">8632</a>，<a href="8875.htm">8875</a>，<a href="9128.htm">9128</a>节）。这就是此处 “你们要在他面前谨慎，不可惹他；他必不容忍你们的过犯”的含义。这种含义也出现在下列经文中：<br />凡吃什么血的，我必向那吃血的人变脸，把他从百姓中间剪除。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利17.10.htm">17:10</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />我向这城变脸，降祸不降福。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶21.10.htm">21:10</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />耶和华向行恶的人变脸，要从世上除灭对他们的记念。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗34.16.htm">34:16</a>）</p>

Take heed of his face. That this signifies holy fear, is evident from the signification of "taking heed of the face," when said of the Lord, who is here meant by "the angel," as being to be afraid lest 
He be angry on account of evils, or lest He be provoked on account of transgressions; as follows. To fear these things is holy fear (concerning which see above, n. 2826, 3718, 3719, 5459, 5534, 7280, 
7788, 8816, 8925). It is said "take heed of his face," because by the "face" is signified the interior things that belong to the life, thus those of the thought and affection, and especially those 
of the faith and the love. The reason is that the face has been formed according to the image of man's interior things, in order that those which are of the internal man may appear in the external man; 
thus that those which are of the spiritual world may appear before the sight in the natural world, and so affect the neighbor. That the face exhibits in a visible form, or as it were in a mirror, the 
things which the man thinks and loves, is known. (That such are the faces of the sincere, and especially of angels, see n. 1999, 2434, 3527, 3573, 4066, 4326, 4796-4799, 5102, 5695, 6604, 8248-8250.) 
 Wherefore in the original tongue "the face" is a general term employed to describe the affections which exist and appear in a man, such as gratitude, favor, benevolence, help, kindness; and also as 
unmercifulness, anger, revenge; consequently in that tongue "the face," taken with what it is joined to, means "near to," "with," "before," "for the sake of," and also "against;" thus whatever is in 
oneself, from oneself, for oneself, and against oneself; for as before said, the face is the man himself, or that which is in the man and shows itself. [2] From all this it can be known what is signified 
by the "face of Jehovah," or by the "face of the angel," by whom is here signified the Lord as to His Divine Human; namely, the Divine good of the Divine love, and the Divine truth from this Divine 
good; for these are in Jehovah or the Lord, and they are from Him; nay, they are Himself (n. 222, 223, 5585). From this it is evident what is signified by the "faces of Jehovah" in the benediction: </p>
<p> 
    Jehovah make His faces to shine upon thee, and be merciful unto thee; Jehovah lift up His faces unto thee, and give thee peace (Num. 6:25, 26).      God be merciful unto us, and bless us, and 
cause His faces to shine upon us (Ps. 67:1).      In like manner in Ps. 80:3, 7, 19; 119:135; Dan. 9:17; and elsewhere. [3] Hence it is that the Lord as to the Divine Human is called "the angel of 
the faces of Jehovah" in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     I will make mention of the mercies of Jehovah. He will recompense them according to His mercies, and according to the multitude of His mercies; and He became their 
Savior; and the angel of His faces saved them, because of His love, and because of His pity (Isa. 63:7-9). That the Lord as to the Divine Human is called "the angel of the faces of Jehovah" is because 
the Divine Human is the Divine Itself in face, that is, in form, as the Lord also teaches in John: </p>
<p>     If ye had known Me, ye had known My Father also; and from henceforth ye have known Him, and 
have seen Him. Philip said, Show us the Father. Jesus said unto him, Am I so long time with you, and hast thou not known Me, Philip? He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father. I am in the Father, and 
the Father in Me. Believe Me that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me (John 14:7-11). [4] By "the face of Jehovah" or the Lord is also signified anger, vengeance, punishment, and evil, for the 
reason that from the common idea that all things are from God the simple believe that evil also is from Him, especially the evil of punishment; and therefore in accordance with this common idea, and 
also according to the appearance, anger, vengeance, punishment, and evil are attributed to Jehovah or the Lord; when yet these are not from the Lord, but from man (on which subject see n. 1861, 2447, 
5798, 6071, 6832, 6991, 6997, 7533, 7632, 7877, 7926, 8197, 8227, 8228, 8282, 8483, 8632, 8875, 9128). Such is the signification here of "take heed of his face, provoke him not, for he will not endure 
your transgression." And also in the following passages: </p>
<p>     Whosoever shall eat any blood, I will set My faces against the soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from the midst of his people 
(Lev. 17:10).      I have set my faces against the city for evil, and not for good (Jer. 21:10).      The face of Jehovah is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth 
(Ps. 34:16). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9306</b></p><p><b>9306.</b>
'Take notice of his face' means holy fear. This is clear from the meaning of 'taking notice of the face', when it has reference to the Lord, whom 'the angel' is used to mean to here, as fearing that 
He may be angry on account of evils, or provoked on account of transgressions, as below; and fearing these things is holy fear. Regarding this fear, see <a href="2826.htm">2826</a>, <a href="3718.htm">3718</a>, <a href="3719.htm">3719</a>, <a href="5459.htm">5459</a>, <a href="5534.htm">5534</a>, <a href="7280.htm">7280</a>, <a href="7788.htm">7788</a>, <a href="8816.htm">8816</a>, <a href="8925.htm">8925</a>. The words 'taking notice of his face' are used because 'the face' means the interior things that constitute a person's life, thus his thought and affection, and in particular his faith and love. 
The reason for this is that the face has been fashioned so that it can produce an image of a person's interiors. It has been so fashioned to the end that those things which belong to the internal man 
may appear within the external, thus to the end that those things which belong to the spiritual world can be visualized in the natural world and so have an effect on one's neighbour. It is well known 
that the face presents visually, or as if in a mirror, what a person thinks and loves. This is so with honest people's faces, and especially with angels' faces, see <a href="1999.htm">1999</a>, <a href="2434.htm">2434</a>, <a href="3527.htm">3527</a>, <a href="3573.htm">3573</a>, <a href="4066.htm">4066</a>, <a href="4326.htm">4326</a>, 
<a href="4796.htm">4796</a>-<a href="4799.htm">4799</a>, <a href="5102.htm">5102</a>, <a href="5695.htm">5695</a>, <a href="6604.htm">6604</a>, <a href="8248.htm">8248</a>-<a href="8250.htm">8250</a>. For this reason 'face' in the original language is a general term that is used to describe the feelings a person has which reveal themselves, such as those of 
indulgence, favour, goodwill, helpfulness, or kindness, and also lack of pity, anger, or vengeance. So it is that in that language when this word is coupled with another it means beside, with, in front 
of, on account of, or else against, thus whatever is within, from, for, or against the person himself. For as has been stated, 'the face' is a person's true self, or that present within a person which 
reveals itself.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 All this enables one to know what is meant by the face of Jehovah, or 'the face of the angel', who in this instance is the Lord in respect of His Divine Human - namely the 
Divine Good of Divine Love, and the Divine Truth emanating from that Divine Good, since these reside within Jehovah or the Lord, come from Him, indeed are Himself, see <a href="222.htm">222</a>, <a href="223.htm">223</a>, <a href="5585.htm">5585</a>. From this it is 
evident what 'the face of Jehovah' means in the Blessing,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah make His face shine upon you and be merciful to you. Jehovah lift up His face upon you and give you peace. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%206:25,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 6:25, 26</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In 
David,  </p>
<blockquote>
God be merciful to us and bless us and make His face shine upon us. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2067:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 67:1</a>.

<blockquote>
The like may be seen in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2080:3,%207,%2019;%20119:134,%20135&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 80:3, 7, 19; 119:134, 135</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%209:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 9:17</a>; and in other places.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 So it is that 
the Lord's Divine Human is called 'the angel of Jehovah's face' in Isaiah,  </p>
<p>I will cause the mercies of Jehovah to be remembered. He has rewarded<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> them according to His mercies, and according to 
the abundance of His mercies; and He became their Saviour. And the angel of His face saved them; in His love and in His pity He redeemed them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2063:7-9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 63:7-9</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>The reason why the Lord's Divine Human is 
called 'the angel of Jehovah's face' is that the Divine Human is the Divine Himself facially, that is, in outward form, as also the Lord teaches in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
If you know Me you know My Father also, 
and from now on you know Him and have seen Him. Philip said, Show us the Father. Jesus said to him, Have I been with you so long, and yet you do not know Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father. 
I am in the Father and the Father is in Me; believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:7-11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:7-11</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 'Jehovah's (or the Lord's) face' also means anger, vengeance, punishment, 
and ill. It does so because simple people, in accepting the general idea that all things come from God, believe that even ill, especially the misery of punishment, comes from Him. For this reason 
- in keeping with that general idea, and also with appearances - anger, vengeance, punishment, or ill is attributed to Jehovah the Lord, when in fact the Lord is not the source of them but man. Regarding 
this, see <a href="1861.htm">1861</a>, <a href="2447.htm">2447</a>, <a href="5798.htm">5798</a>, <a href="6071.htm">6071</a>, <a href="6832.htm">6832</a>, <a href="6991.htm">6991</a>, <a href="6997.htm">6997</a>, <a href="7533.htm">7533</a>, <a href="7632.htm">7632</a>, <a href="7877.htm">7877</a>, <a href="7926.htm">7926</a>, <a href="8197.htm">8197</a>, <a href="8227.htm">8227</a>, <a href="8228.htm">8228</a>, <a href="8282.htm">8282</a>, <a href="8483.htm">8483</a>, <a href="8632.htm">8632</a>, <a href="8875.htm">8875</a>, <a href="9128.htm">9128</a>. This kind of meaning appears here in 'take notice of his face, lest you 
provoke him, for he will not bear your transgression', and also in Leviticus,  </p>
<blockquote>
Whoever eats any blood, I will set My face against the soul eating blood and will cut him off from among his people.

<p>And in David,  </p>

sum et Pater in Me; credite Mihi quod Ego in Patre et Pater in Me, xiv 7-11. 	[4] Per `faciem Jehovae' seu Domini etiam significatur ira, vindicta, punitio, {4} malum, ex causa quia simplices, ex 
idea communi quod omnia sint a Deo, credunt quod etiam malum, imprimis malum poenae; quapropter secundum communem illam ideam, et quoque secundum apparentiam, tribuitur Jehovae seu Domino ira, vindicta, 
punitio, et malum, cum tamen illa non sunt {5} a Domino sed ab homine de qua re videatur n. 1861, 2447, 5798, (x)6071, (a)6832, (x)6991, 6997, 7533, 7632, 7877, 7926, 8197, 8227, 8218, 8282, 8483, 
8632, 8875 9128; tale significatur hic per `custodi a facie ejus, ne exacerbes eum quia non feret praevaricationem vestram': et quoque in Levitico, 	Quisquis comederit ullum sanguinem, dabo facies Meas 
contra illam animam comedentem sanguinem, et exscindam illam e medio populi ejus, xvii 10: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam, 	Posui facies Meas contra urbem in malum et non in bonum xxi 10: </p>
<p>(o)et apud Davidem, 	Facies 
Jehovae contra facientes malum ad exscindendum e terra memoriam eorum, Ps. xxxiv 17 [A. V. 16]. @1 i est$ @2 ut dictum est$ @3 i Nemo venit ad Patrem nisi per Me [v 6]$ @4 i et$ @5 After Domino$ </p>
