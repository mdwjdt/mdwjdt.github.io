<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5114节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5114.</strong>“葡萄树上有三根枝子”表由此甚至直到最末层的衍生物。这从“葡萄树”、“三”和“枝子”的含义清楚可知：“葡萄树”是指理解力部分，如刚才所述（<a href="5113.htm">5113</a>节）；“三”是指完整并持续到结束之物（<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="4495.htm">4495</a>节）；“枝子”是指衍生物。由于“葡萄树”表示理解力部分，所以“枝子”无非表示由此而来的衍生物。由于“三”表示持续甚至直到结束之物，或从初到末之物，所以“三根枝子”表示从理解部分延伸到最末层，也就是感官层的衍生物。按照顺序，第一层是理解力部分本身，最末层是感官层。一般来说，理解力部分是内在人所拥有并凭主所放射的天堂之光看见的视觉；它所看见的一切事物都是属灵的或属天的。但一般来说，感官层属于外在人；此处是指视觉的感官能力，因为这种感官能力对应于理解力部分，并受它支配。视觉的感官能力凭太阳所放射的光看见，它所看见的一切事物都是世俗、肉体和地上的。<br />人里面有从居于天堂之光的理解力部分直到居于尘世之光的感官的衍生物。除非这些衍生物存在，否则感官就无法拥有人类品质的生命。人不能将他的感官所拥有的生命归功于他凭尘世之光看见，因为尘世之光没有生命在里面，而应将这生命归功于凭天堂之光看见，因为这光有生命在里面。当天堂之光落到人凭尘世之光所获得的觉知上时，这光便给它们带来生命，使他能明智地、因而作为一个人来看物体。以这种方式拥有由世上耳闻目睹的事物，因而由通过感官进入的事物所生知识的人就拥有聪明和智慧，并由此拥有文明、道德和属灵的生活。<br />至于具体的衍生物，它们在人里面的存在具有无法以三言两语解释清楚的性质。它们作为层级存在，就像梯子，从理解力部分直到感官。但没有人能理解这些层级，除非他知道它们如何彼此关联，也就是说，如何明显彼此不同而又互相分离，并且如此明显以致内层离了外层仍能存在并持续存在，而外层离了内层则不能。例如：人的灵离开肉体仍能持续存在，而且当它通过死亡与肉体分离时，也的确持续存在。人的灵就处于内在层级，身体则处于外在层级。死后人的灵也一样。若他在蒙福者之列，当在第一层天堂时，他的灵就处于最末和最外层级；当在第二层天堂时，就处于较为内在的层级；当在第三层天堂时，则处于至内在的层级。当处于至内层级时，它同时也处于其它层级，尽管这些层级在他里面沉寂下来，并不活跃，几乎就像人体在睡眠时沉寂下来、不活跃一样；但也有这样的区别：对天使来说，那时内层是最为清醒的。因此，人里面存在和天堂一样多的层级，此外还有最末层，也就是身体和身体感官。<br />由此在某种程度上明显可知，从初至末，或从理解力部分直到感官的衍生物是何情形。人从主的神性所得来的生命便经过这些层级，从至内层直到最末层。每一层级内都有那生命的一个衍生物，这衍生物变得越来越普遍，直到在最末层变得最为普遍。较低层级内的衍生物纯粹是组合物，确切地说，是连续排列的更高层级的个体和特定成分的结构形式，连同先从较为纯净的自然界，之后从较为粗糙的自然界所提取出来的那类事物，这些事物能充当盛纳的器皿。一旦这些器皿腐烂分解，在这些器皿中取得形式的更高层级的个体和特定成分就返回到紧邻的上一层级。由于人与神性有一种联系，他的至内层具有这样的性质：它能接受神性，不仅能接受它，还能通过承认神性、拥有对它的一种情感，因而通过回应它而将它变成自己的，他由此拥有植入在自己里面的神性，所以他能永远不死。事实上，永恒和无限之物不仅通过神性进入他的流注，还通过他对神性的接受而存在于他里面。<br />由此可见，那些在思想人时，把人等同于动物，以为人死后和动物一样不再活着的人是何等无知和愚蠢。这种人没有考虑到这一事实：动物并没有对神性的接受，也没有通过将神性变成自己的而通向回应它的任何承认或情感，因而没有与它的任何结合。这些人也没有考虑到这一事实：由于动物的状态具有这种性质，所以它们所拥有的生命接受形式必会消散；因为对动物来说，流注通过它们的器官形式一直进入世界，并在那里终结并消失，永不返回。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5114</b></p><p><b>5114.</b>
And in the vine were three shoots. That this signifies the derivations thence even to the last, is evident from the signification of the "vine," as being the intellectual part (of which just above, n. 
5113); and from the signification of "three," as being what is complete and continuous even to the end (n. 2788, 4495); and from the signification of "shoots," as being derivations. For as the "vine" 
is the intellectual part, the "shoots" are nothing else than derivations thence; and as "three" signifies what is continuous even to the end, or from the first even to the last, by "three shoots" are 
signified the derivations from the intellectual part down to the last, which is the sensuous; for the first in order is the intellectual part, and the last is the sensuous. The intellectual part in 
general is the sight of the internal man, which sees from the light of heaven, which is from the Lord, and all that it sees is spiritual and celestial. But the sensuous in general is of the external man, 
here the sensuous of the sight, because this corresponds and is subordinate to the intellectual; this sensuous sees from the light of the world, which is from the sun, and all that it sees is worldly, 
bodily, and earthly. [2] There are in man derivations from the intellectual part, which is in the light of heaven, down to the sensuous, which is in the light of the world; unless this were so, 
the sensuous could not have any human life. The sensuous of man has no life in consequence of seeing from the light of the world, for the light of the world has no life in it; but in consequence of seeing 
from the light of heaven, for this light has life in it. When this light falls with man into those things which are from the light of the world, it vivifies them and causes him to see objects intellectually, 
thus as a man; and from this, by knowledges born from things he has seen and heard in the world, thus from things that have entered through the senses, man has intelligence and wisdom, and 
from these has civil, moral, and spiritual life.  [3] As regards the derivations specially, in man they are of such a nature that they cannot be briefly set forth. They are steps or degrees as of a 
ladder between the intellectual part and the sensuous, but no one can apprehend these degrees unless he knows that they are most distinct from one another, so distinct that the interior can exist and 
subsist without the exterior, but not the exterior without the interior. For example: the spirit of man can subsist without the material body, and also actually does so subsist when by death it is separated 
from the body. The spirit of man is in an interior degree, and the body is in an exterior degree. It is similar with the spirit of man after death: if he is among the blessed, he is in the last 
degree among them when in the first heaven, in an interior degree when in the second, and in the inmost when in the third; and when he is in this, he is indeed at the same time in the rest, but these 
are quiescent in him, almost as the bodily part in man is quiescent in sleep, but with this difference, that with the angels the interiors are then in the highest wakefulness. Therefore there are as 
many distinct degrees in man as there are heavens, besides the last, which is the body with its sensuous things. [4] From this it may in some measure appear how the case is with the derivations from 
first to last, or from the intellectual part down to the sensuous. The life of man, which is from the Lord's Divine, passes through these degrees from the inmost down to the last or ultimate degree, 
and in each degree it is derived from what is prior, becoming more and more general, and in the ultimate degree most general. The derivations in the lower degrees are merely compositions, or rather combinations 
[conformationes], of the singulars and particulars of the higher degrees in succession, together with an addition from purer nature, and then from grosser nature, of such things as may serve 
for containing vessels; and if these vessels are decomposed, the singulars and particulars of the interior degrees, which had been combined therein, return to the degree next higher. And as with man 
there is a connection with the Divine, and his inmost is of such a nature that he can receive the Divine, and not only receive it, but also make it his own by acknowledgment and affection, thus by reciprocation, 
he therefore can never die, because he has thus been implanted in the Divine, and is therefore in what is eternal and infinite, not merely through the influx thence, but also through the 
reception of it. [5] From this it may be seen how unlearnedly and inanely those think about man who compare him to the brute animals, and believe that he will not live after death any more than they-not 
considering that with the brute animals there is no reception, nor through acknowledgment and affection any reciprocal appropriation, of the Divine, and consequent conjunction with it; and not considering 
that in consequence of the state of animals being of this nature, the recipient forms of their life cannot but be dissipated; for with them the influx passes through their organic forms down 
into the world, and there terminates and vanishes, and never returns. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5114</b></p><p><b>5114.</b>
'And on the vine three shoots' means derivatives from this even to the final one. This is clear from the meaning of 'the vine' as the understanding part, dealt with immediately above in <a href="5113.htm">5113</a>; from the 
meaning of 'three' as complete and continuous even to the end, dealt with in <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="4495.htm">4495</a>; and from the meaning of 'shoots' as derivatives; for since 'the vine' means the understanding part, 'shoots' 
means nothing else than derivatives from this. Because 'three' means that which is continuous even to the end, that is, which goes from first to last, 'three shoots' means derivative degrees extending 
from the understanding part to the final level, which is that of the senses. The first in the sequence is the actual understanding part, and the last is the senses. In general the understanding part 
is the sight which the internal man possesses and which sees by the light of heaven radiating from the Lord; and everything it sees is spiritual or celestial. But the senses, in general, belong to the 
external man; and here the sensory power of sight is meant because this corresponds to and is subordinate to the understanding part. The sensory power of sight sees by the light of the world radiating 
from the sun; and everything it sees is worldly, bodily, or earthly. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the human being there exist derivatives from the understanding part that dwells in the light of heaven; and they extend 
to the senses which dwell in the light of the world. Unless these derivatives existed the senses could not possess any life of a human quality. A person does not owe the life which his senses possess 
to what he sees by the light of the world, for the light of the world holds no life within it; he owes it to what he sees by the light of heaven, for this light does hold life within it. When the light 
of heaven falls on the perceptions a person has gained by the light of the world, it brings life to them and enables him to see objects in an intelligent manner, and thus as a human being. In this 
way a person possessing factual knowledge born from things which he has seen and heard in the world, and therefore from those which have entered in through the senses, comes to possess intelligence and 
wisdom, on which in turn he bases his public, private, and spiritual life. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 As regards derivatives specifically, the nature of their existence in a person is such that no brief explanation of 
them is possible. They exist as degrees, like steps, from the understanding part down to the senses. But no one can have any conception of those degrees unless he knows how they are related to one another, 
that is to say, that they are quite distinct and separate from one another, so distinct that interior degrees can come into being and remain in being without exterior ones, but not exterior degrees 
without interior ones. For example, a person's spirit can remain in being without a material body, as it also actually does when death separates it from the body. For a person's spirit exists in an 
interior degree, his body in an exterior one. Similarly with a person's spirit after death. If he is one of the blessed his spirit exists in a final and outermost degree when in the first heaven; in 
a more interior degree when in the second; and in the inmost one when in the third. When it exists in the inmost it exists at the same time in the other degrees, though these are inactive with him, almost 
as the human body is inactive during sleep, but with this difference that interiorly angels are at such times fully awake. Therefore as many distinct and separate degrees exist in the human being 
as there are heavens, apart from the final one, which is the body and the bodily senses.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 From all this regarding a person's spirit one may gain some idea of the way derivatives are related to 
one another from the first to the final one, that is, from the understanding part to the senses. A person's life, which he receives from the Lord's Divine, passes through these degrees from the inmost 
to the final one. At every degree there exists a derivative of that life which becomes increasingly general, until in the final degree it is the most general. Derivatives in the lower degrees are merely 
combinations - or to put it more appropriately, structured forms - of the individual and particular constituents of the higher degrees ranged consecutively, with the addition of the kinds of things 
drawn from purer nature, and after that from grosser nature, that can serve as containing vessels. Once these vessels are done away with, the individual and particular constituents of the higher degrees, 
which had received form in those vessels, move back to the degree immediately above. And because in the case of the human being there is a link with the Divine, and his inmost being is such that 
it can accept the Divine - and not only accept but also make Him its own, by acknowledging and having an affection for the Divine, thus by a reciprocal response to Him - and because he thereby has 
the Divine implanted within him, he can never die. Indeed what is eternal and infinite exists with him, not only through their flowing into him but also through his reception of them.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 From this 
one may see how uninformed and senseless in their thinking regarding the human being those people are who compare him to animals and imagine that he will not be alive after death any more than they 
are. Such people do not take into consideration the fact that with animals there is no acceptance of the Divine or any acknowledgement or affection leading to a reciprocal response to the Divine by making 
Him their own, or any consequent joining to Him. Nor do those people take into consideration the fact that, as the animal state is like this, the recipient forms of life which these possess are inevitably 
dissipated; for with animals that which flows into them passes through their organic forms into the world, where it comes to an end and melts away, never to make any return there. </p>

`Et in vite tres propagines': quod significet derivationes inde usque ad ultimam, constat ex significatione `vitis' quod sit intellectuale, de qua mox supra n. 5113; ex significatione `trium' quod 
sint completum et continuum usque ad finem, de qua n. 2788, 4495; et ex significatione `propaginum' quod sint derivationes; cum enim vitis est intellectuale, propagines non aliud sunt quam derivationes 
inde, et quia tres significant continuum usque ad finem, seu a primo usque ad ultimum, per `tres propagines' significantur derivationes ab intellectuali ad ultimum quod est sensuale; primum 
enim in ordine est intellectuale, et ultimum est sensuale; intellectuale (t)in communi est visuale interni hominis, quod a luce caeli quae a Domino, videt, et quod videt, omne est spirituale et caeleste; </p>
<p>sensuale 
autem in communi est externi hominis, hic sensuale visus quia hoc correspondet et subordinatum est intellectuali; illud sensuale a luce mundi quae a sole, videt, et quod videt, omne 
est mundanum, corporeum et terrestre.  [2] Dantur in homine derivationes ab intellectuali quod est in luce caeli, ad sensuale quod est in luce mundi; nisi darentur, sensuale non potuisset ullam vitam 
qualis est humana, habere; vita sensuali hominis {1} non est ex eo quod videat ex luce mundi, nam lux mundi in se nullam vitam habet, sed ex eo quod videat ex luce caeli, nam haec lux vitam in 
se habet; cum haec lux incidit apud hominem in illa quae sunt ex luce mundi, tunc vivificat illa, et facit ut videat objecta intellectualiter, ita sicut homo; inde homini ex scientificis quae enata 
sunt ex illis quae in mundo viderat et audiverat, proinde ex illis quae intraverant per sensualia, intelligentia et sapientia, et ex hac vita civilis, moralis, et spiritualis.  [3] Quod in specie 
derivationes attinet, sunt illae apud hominem tales ut paucis exponi nequeant; sunt gradus sicut scalae inter intellectuale et sensuale, sed gradus illos nemo potest capere nisi sciat quomodo cum illis 
se habet, quod nempe inter se distinctissimi sint, et quod tam distincti ut interiores existere et subsistere possint absque exterioribus, non autem exteriores absque interioribus; sicut pro exemplo: 
spiritus hominis subsistere potest absque corpore materiali, et quoque actualiter subsistit cum per mortem separatur a corpore; spiritus hominis in gradu interiore est, et {2} corpus in exteriore; 
similiter etiam se habet cum spiritu hominis post mortem; si inter beatos est, in ultimo gradu ibi est cum in primo caelo, in interiore gradu {3} cum in secundo, et in intimo cum in tertio; et 
cum in hoc est, tunc quidem simul est in reliquis, sed hi quiescunt apud illum, paene sicut corporeum apud hominem quiescit in somno, at cum differentia quod interiora apud angelos tunc in summa 
vigilia sint; totidem itaque distincti gradus apud hominem dantur, quot sunt caeli, praeter ultimum, qui est corpus cum sensualibus ejus.  [4] Ex his aliquatenus constare potest quomodo se habet cum 
derivationibus a primo ad ultimum, seu ab intellectuali ad sensuale; vita hominis quae a Divino Domini, transit per hos gradus ab intimo ad ultimum, et ubivis derivatur, fitque communius et communius, 
et in{4} ultimo communissimum; </p>
<p>derivationes in gradibus inferioribus sunt modo compositiones, seu aptius, conformationes singularium et particularium graduum superiorum successive, cum adjectis 
talibus e puriore natura, et dein ex crassiore quae pro vasis continentibus inservire possunt; </p>
<p>quibus vasis resolutis, singularia et {5} particularia interiorum graduum, quae inibi conformata fuerunt, 
redeunt ad proxime superiorem gradum: et quia apud hominem est nexus cum Divino, et intimum ejus (t)est tale ut Divinum recipere possit, nec solum recipere, sed etiam sibi appropriare per agnitionem 
et affectionem, ita per reciprocum, idcirco homo quia ita implantatus est Divino, nusquam mori potest, est enim in aeterno et infinito, {6} non modo per influxum inde, sed etiam per receptionem; 
[5] inde videri potest quam indocte et inaniter illi cogitant de homine qui comparant illum animalibus brutis, et credunt non victurum illum post mortem magis quam illa, non considerantes quod 
apud (t)animalia bruta nulla receptio, et per aliquam agnitionem et affectionem appropriatio reciproca Divini sit, et inde conjunctio; </p>
<p>et cum status illorum talis est, quod formae recipientes vitae eorum 
non aliter possint quam dissipari; transit enim apud illa influxus per organicas eorum formas usque in mundum, et ibi terminatur et evanescit, nec usquam redit. </p>
