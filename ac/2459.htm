<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2459节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2459.</strong>“罗得从琐珥上去”表当他们不再具有对真理的情感后。这从“琐珥”的含义清楚可知，“琐珥”是指对真理的情感（参看<a href="2439.htm">2439</a>节）。由于紧接下来是“罗得怕住在琐珥，就住在山里”，故意思是“当他们不同去具有对真理的情感后”，因为如从26节经文所清楚知道的，伴随真理的一切良善都荒凉了。因此，本节描述了罗得所代表的教会的第五个状态。该状态就是，对真理的情感不复存在后，一种不纯洁的良善，或包裹在虚假中的良善就将自身注入进来。</p>

Lot went up out of Zoar. That this signifies when they were no longer in the affection of truth, is evident from the signification of "Zoar," as being the affection of truth (see n. 2439); and as there 
follows the statement that "he dwelt in the mountain because he feared to dwell in Zoar," the signification is "when they were no longer in the affection of truth," and this because all the good of 
truth had been vastated, as is evident from verse 26. In this verse therefore there is described the fifth state of the church which was represented by Lot, which state was that after there was no longer 
any affection of truth, a kind of impure good, or good of falsity, infused itself. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2459</b></p><p><b>2459.</b>
'Lot went up out of Zoar' means when the affection for truth existed with them no longer. This is clear from the meaning of 'Zoar' as the affection for truth, dealt with in <a href="2439.htm">2439</a>; and because 'he dwelt 
in the mountain, for he was afraid to live in Zoar' follows immediately after, the meaning is that the affection for truth existed with them no longer, because, as is clear from verse 26, all good that 
accompanies truth was vastated. The description at this point is of the fifth state of the Church represented by Lot, a state in which, when the affection for truth exists no longer, an impure kind 
of good, which is good enveloped in falsity, introduces itself. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2459</b>
</p><b>2459.</b>
`Ascendit Lot e Zoar': quod significet cum non amplius in affectione veri essent, constat a significatione `Zoaris' quod sit affectio veri, de qua n. 2439, et quia sequitur quod `habitavit in monte, 
quoniam timuit habitare in Zoar,' significatur cum non amplius in affectione veri essent, et hoc quia omne bonum veri vastatum est, ut constat a vers. 26.  Hic nunc quintus status Ecclesiae quae per 
`Lotum' repraesentatur, describitur, qui est quod postquam nulla amplius affectio veri, bonum quoddam impurum, seu bonum falsi, se infundat. </p>
