<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8639.</strong>另一方面，不知道主是人类救世主的人不可能信祂、敬拜祂、爱祂，从而为了祂的缘故而行善。不知道一切良善皆来自祂的人不可能认为他的公义和拯救来自祂，更不会意愿事实就是如此，因而不能靠祂活着。不知道有一个地狱，有一个天堂，或有永生的人甚至不能思想天堂的生命，或使自己去接受它。在信的其它一切事上也是如此。</p>

On the other hand, he who does not know that the Lord is the Savior of the human race, cannot have faith in Him, worship Him, love Him, and thus do good for His sake. He who does not know that all good 
is from Him, cannot think that his own righteousness and his own salvation are from Him, still less can he will it to be so, thus he cannot live from Him. He who does not know that there is a hell, 
and that there is a heaven, nor that there is eternal life, cannot even think about the life of heaven, nor apply himself to receiving it; and so in all other things. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8639</b></p><p><b>8639.</b>
A person, for example, who does not know that the Lord is the Saviour of the human race cannot possess faith in Him, worship Him, love Him, or thus do good for His sake. A person who does not know that 
all good comes from Him is incapable of thinking that his righteousness and his salvation come from Him, let alone of desiring that they should do so, and so is incapable of living from Him. A person 
who does not know that there is a hell and a heaven, or that there is a life lasting forever, is not even capable of thinking about the life of heaven or of applying himself to receive it. The same 
is so with all other matters of faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 8639</b>
</p><b>8639.</b>
Ut, qui non scit quod Dominus sit Salvator generis humani, non potest fidem habere in Ipsum, adorare Ipsum, amare Ipsum, et sic facere bonum propter Ipsum; qui non scit quod omne bonum ab Ipso, non 
potest cogitare quod justitia sua et salus sua sit ab Ipso, minus potest velle quod ita sit, ita non potest vivere ab Ipso; qui non scit quod infernum sit et quod caelum, nec quod vita aeterna, is ne 
quidem cogitare potest de vita caeli, nec applicare se ad recipiendam illam; ita in reliquis. </p>
