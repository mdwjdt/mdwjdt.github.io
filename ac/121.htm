<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>121.</strong>这些河的流向说明了属天的生命次序是怎样的，那就是，从主（他是“东方”）发出智慧，从智慧发出聪明，从聪明发出理性，理性激活知识。这是生命的次序，属天之人即是如此。象征属天之人的以色列的长老因而被称为“有智慧，有聪明，有知识的”（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申1.13.htm">1:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申1.15.htm">15</a>），制造约柜的比撒列也因而被描述说：“神的灵充满了他，使他有智慧、聪明、知识，能作各样的工。”（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出31.3.htm">31:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出35.31.htm">35:31</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出36.1.htm">36:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出36.2.htm">2</a>）</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]121.</strong> How the inner life of heavenly people is organized, or the order in which its constituent parts develop, may be illustrated by these rivers. To be specific, the pattern starts with the Lord, who is the east. From him comes wisdom, through wisdom comes understanding, through understanding comes reason; and reason, in turn, makes the facts we have memorized come alive. This is the proper way for the inner life to be organized, and that is how it is organized in heavenly people.<br />This is why the elders of Israel, in representing heavenly people, were described as wise, understanding, and knowledgeable (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_121/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_1_13" target=_top>Deuteronomy 1:13</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_121/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_1_15" target=_top>15</a>). Likewise Bezalel, the maker of the ark, is described as being "filled with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in every kind of work" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_121/bible_king-james-version_exodus_31_3" target=_top>Exodus 31:3</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_121/bible_king-james-version_exodus_35_31" target=_top>35:31</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_121/bible_king-james-version_exodus_36_1-2" target=_top>36:1-2</a>). </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 121</b></p><p><b>121.</b>
The nature of celestial order, or how the things of life proceed, is evident from these rivers, namely, from the Lord, who is the "East" and that from Him proceeds wisdom, through wisdom intelligence, 
through intelligence reason, and so by means of reason the knowledges of the memory are vivified. This is the order of life, and such are celestial men; and therefore, since the elders of Israel represented 
celestial men, they were called "wise, intelligent, and knowing" (Deut. 1:13, 15). Hence it is said of Bezaleel, who constructed the ark, that he was: Filled with the spirit of God, in wisdom, 
in understanding, and in knowledge [scientia], and in all work (Exod. 31:3; 35:31; 36:1-2). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 121</b></p><p><b>121.</b>
The nature of celestial order, or how the things that constitute life progress, becomes clear from these rivers. It is as follows: The progression starts from the Lord who is the east. From Him comes 
wisdom; through wisdom comes intelligence, and through intelligence reason. Thus facts which belong to the memory are quickened by means of reason. Such is the proper order of life, and such the nature 
of celestial people. Consequently since the elders of Israel represented celestial people they were called 'wise, intelligent, and knowledgeable men', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%201:13,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 1:13, 15</a>. So too was Bezalel, who made the 
Ark, of whom it is said that he was filled with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with intelligence, and with knowledge, and with all workmanship. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2031:3;%2035:31;%2036:1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 31:3; 35:31; 36:1, 2</a>.

Qualis est ordo caelestis, aut quomodo procedant illa quae sunt vitae, a fluviis his constare potest: nempe, a Domino, Qui est Oriens, ab Ipso sapientia, per sapientiam intelligentia, per intelligentiam 
ratio, sic per rationem vivificantur scientifica, quae sunt memoriae: hic est ordo vitae; tales sunt caelestes homines: quare cum seniores Israelis repraesentarent caelestes homines, dicti sunt 'sapientes, 
intelligentes, et scientes,' Deut. i 13, 15; similiter Bezaleel qui construxit arcam, de quo dicitur, 	Quod impletus spiritu Dei, in sapientia, in intelligentia, et in scientia, et in omni 
opere, Exod. xxxi 	3; xxxv 31; xxxvi 1, 2.
