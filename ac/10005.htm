<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10005节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10005</strong>.“和以弗得的外袍”表属灵国度的中间部分。这从“外袍”的含义清楚可知，“外袍”是指间接从神性属天层发出的神性属灵层，因而是指属灵国度的中间部分（参看<a href="9825.htm">9825</a>节）。它之所以被称为“以弗得的外袍”，是因为外袍与以弗得相配；此外，它通过带子而与内袍区分开来。因为带子有两条，第一条是以弗得和外袍共用的，第二条只用于内袍。这第二条带子表示内袍所代表的属灵国度的事物有别于外袍和以弗得一起代表的事物，并与这些事物分离。“带子”或“腰带”表示将内层事物保持在关联中（<a href="9828.htm">9828</a>节），也用来将事物彼此分开（<a href="9944.htm">9944</a>节）的一种共同纽带。<br />此处的情形是这样：有三样事物按先后次序接踵而来。在天堂，这三者被称为属天层、属灵层和源于这两层的属世层。属天之物是对主之爱的良善；属灵之物是对邻舍之仁的良善；源于它们的属世之物是信之良善。属天之物，或对主之爱的良善构成至内层或第三层天堂；属灵之物，或对邻之仁的良善，构成中间或第二层天堂；源于它们的属世之物，或信之良善，构成最低层或第一层天堂。由于亚伦的衣服代表主的属灵国度（<a href="9814.htm">9814</a>节），故从所提到的事物明显可知内袍代表什么，外袍代表什么，以弗得又代表什么，即：内袍代表联结属灵国度和属天国度的媒介，因些，它也通过带子与代表属灵国度，无论内在和外在的外袍和以弗得区分开来（关于内袍，参看<a href="9826.htm">9826</a>，<a href="9942.htm">9942</a>节；关于外袍，参看<a href="9825.htm">9825</a>节；关于以弗得，参看<a href="9824.htm">9824</a>节）。<br />从前面关于会幕的说明也能获得对这个主题的某种概念，会幕代表天堂，而主就在天堂中。会幕的至内在部分，就是法柜所在的地方，代表至内层或第三层天堂；帷帐之外的居所代表中间或第二层天堂；院子代表第一层或最低层天堂。它们同样是属天层、属灵层和源于这两层的属世层。但联结至内层天堂和中间天堂的媒介由圣所和至圣所之间的帷帐来代表，就像它由亚伦身上的内袍来代表一样（关于帐幕的至内在部分是柜子，可参看<a href="9485.htm">9485</a>节；关于帷帐之外的居所，可参看<a href="9594.htm">9594</a>，<a href="9632.htm">9632</a>节；关于院子，可参看<a href="9741.htm">9741</a>节；关于帷帐，就是联结至内层天堂和中间天堂的媒介，可参看<a href="9670.htm">9670</a>，<a href="9671.htm">9671</a>节）。<br />从人与天堂的对应关系能获得对这一切的一个更清楚的概念；因为人的一切部位与存在于天堂里的一切事物都有一种对应关系（可参看前面众多章节末尾的说明）。人的头部对应于至内层或第三层天堂，就是有属天良善的地方；胸部及至腰对应于中间或第二层天堂，就是有属灵良善的地方；脚对应于最低层或第一层天堂，就是有属世良善的地方。然而，颈部凭对应关系而为联结至内层天堂和中间天堂的媒介（<a href="9913.htm">9913</a>，<a href="9914.htm">9914</a>节），和帐幕里的帷帐是一样的。因为自然界中的一切代表都类似人的形式，并且具有与它们所类似的人形部分一样的含义（<a href="9496.htm">9496</a>节）。由此可见为何“内袍”通过带子与外袍和以弗得区分开来，又为何外袍被称为“以弗得的外袍”。</p>

And the robe of the ephod. That this signifies the middle of this kingdom, is evident from the signification of "the robe" as being the Divine spiritual that proceeds mediately from the Divine celestial, 
thus the middle of the spiritual kingdom (see n. 9825). It is called "the robe of the ephod" because the robe belonged to the ephod; moreover, it was distinguished from the tunic by the girdle; for 
there were two girdles, one in common for the ephod and the robe together, the other for the tunic alone, which signified that those things of the spiritual kingdom which were represented by the tunic, 
were distinct from those which were represented by the robe and the ephod together. The "girdle," or "belt," signifies the general bond by which the interior things are held in connection (n. 9828), 
and also by which the one is separated from the other (n. 9944).  [2] The case herein is this. There are three things that follow or succeed in order, which three in the heavens are called the Celestial, 
the Spiritual, and the Natural thence derived. The celestial is the good of love to the Lord; the spiritual is the good of charity toward the neighbor; and the natural thence derived is the good 
of faith. The celestial, which is the good of love to the Lord, constitutes the inmost or third heaven; the spiritual, which is the good of charity toward the neighbor, constitutes the middle or second 
heaven; and the natural thence derived, which is the good of faith, constitutes the ultimate or first heaven. As the garments of Aaron represented the Lord's spiritual kingdom (n. 9814), it is evident 
from what has been said what the tunic represented, and what the robe, and what the ephod; namely, that the tunic represented the uniting medium of the spiritual kingdom with the celestial kingdom, 
and therefore it was distinguished by the girdle from the robe and the ephod, which represented the spiritual kingdom, internal and external. (Concerning the tunic, see n. 9826, 9942; concerning 
the robe, n. 9825; and concerning the ephod, n. 9824.) [3] An idea of this subject can also be had from what has been previously shown concerning the Tent of meeting, by which was represented heaven, 
wherein is the Lord. By its inmost, where was the ark of the Testimony, was represented the inmost or third heaven; by the Habitation, which was outside the veil, was represented the middle or second 
heaven; and by the court, the first or ultimate heaven; thus also the celestial, the spiritual, and the derivative natural. But the uniting medium of the inmost heaven and the middle heaven was represented 
by the veil between the holy place and the holy of holies, in like manner as by the tunic upon Aaron. (Concerning the inmost of the Tent where was the ark, see n. 9485; concerning the Habitation 
which was outside the veil, n. 9594, 9632; concerning the court, n. 9741; and concerning the veil, as being the uniting medium of the inmost and middle heavens, n. 9670, 9671.)  [4] A still better 
idea of all this can be formed from the correspondence of man with the heavens, in that there is a correspondence of all things in man with all things in the heavens. (See what has been previously shown 
at the end of many chapters.) The head with man corresponds to the inmost or third heaven, where is celestial good; the breast as far as the loins corresponds to the middle or second heaven, where 
is spiritual good; and the feet correspond to the ultimate or first heaven, where is natural good. But the neck is by correspondence the uniting medium of the inmost and middle heavens (n. 9913, 9914), 
in like manner as was the veil in the Tent. For all the representatives in nature bear relation to the human form, and have a signification according to their relation to it (n. 9496). From all this 
it can now be seen why the tunic was kept distinct by the girdle from the robe and the ephod, and also why the robe is called "the robe of the ephod." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10005</b></p><p><b>10005.</b>
'The robe of the ephod' means the middle part of that kingdom. This is clear from the meaning of 'the robe' as the Divine Spiritual emanating indirectly from the Divine Celestial, thus the middle of 
the spiritual kingdom, dealt with in <a href="9825.htm">9825</a>. The reason why it is called 'the robe of the ephod' is that the robe went with the ephod; it was also kept distinct from the tunic by means of a girdle. For 
there were two girdles; the first was an overall one for the ephod and robe together, the second was for the tunic alone. This second girdle served to mean that the things of the spiritual kingdom which 
were represented by the tunic were distinct and separate from those represented by the robe and ephod together. 'A girdle (or belt)' means a common bond which holds more internal things in connection, <a href="9828.htm">9828</a>, and also serves to separate one thing from another, <a href="9944.htm">9944</a>.  </p>

 The implications of all this are that there are three realities which follow one another in consecutive order. In heaven those 
three are called celestial, spiritual, and the natural springing from these. That which is celestial is the good of love to the Lord, that which is spiritual is the good of charity towards the neighbour, 
and that which is natural and springs from them is the good of faith. What is celestial, or the good of love to the Lord, constitutes the inmost or third heaven; what is spiritual, or the good 
of charity towards the neighbour, constitutes the middle or second heaven; and what is natural springing from these, or the good of faith, constitutes the lowest or first heaven. Since Aaron's garments 
represented the Lord's spiritual kingdom, <a href="9814.htm">9814</a>, it is evident from things which have been mentioned what the tunic represented, what the robe represented, and what the ephod represented. That is to 
say, the tunic represented the intermediary that unites the spiritual kingdom to the celestial kingdom, and therefore also it was kept distinct by means of a girdle from the robe and ephod, which represented 
the spiritual kingdom, internal and external. Regarding the tunic, see <a href="9826.htm">9826</a>, <a href="9942.htm">9942</a>; regarding the robe, <a href="9825.htm">9825</a>; and regarding the ephod, <a href="9824.htm">9824</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Some idea of this matter may also be gained 
from what has been shown previously regarding the tent of meeting, which represented heaven in which the Lord was present. The inmost part of it, where the ark of the Testimony was, represented the inmost 
or third heaven; the dwelling-place, which was outside the veil, represented the middle or second heaven; and the court represented the  first or lowest heaven. And they in like manner were celestial, 
spiritual, and the natural springing from these. But the intermediary uniting the inmost and middle heavens was represented by the veil between the holy place and the holy of holies, in the same 
way as it was by the tunic on Aaron. Regarding the inmost part of the tent where the ark was, see <a href="9485.htm">9485</a>; regarding the dwelling-place which was outside the veil, <a href="9594.htm">9594</a>, <a href="9632.htm">9632</a>; regarding the court, <a href="9741.htm">9741</a>; 
and regarding the veil, the intermediary uniting the inmost and middle heavens, <a href="9670.htm">9670</a>, <a href="9671.htm">9671</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 An even better idea of these things may be acquired from the correspondence of the human being with 
the heavens; for all the parts of the human being have a correspondence with everything that exists in the heavens, see what has been shown previously at the ends of a number of chapters. The human 
head corresponds to the inmost or third heaven, where there is celestial good; the breast down to the loins corresponds to the middle or second heaven, where there is spiritual good; and the feet correspond 
to the lowest or first heaven, where there is natural good. The neck however, by virtue of correspondence, is the intermediary uniting the inmost and middle heavens, <a href="9913.htm">9913</a>, <a href="9914.htm">9914</a>, in the same way 
as the veil in the tent was. For all representatives on the natural level resemble the human form and have the same meaning as the parts of it which they resemble, <a href="9496.htm">9496</a>. From all this it now becomes 
clear why the tunic was kept distinct from the robe and ephod by means of a girdle, and also why the robe is called 'the robe of the ephod'.  </p>

`Pallio ephodi': quod significet medium illius regni, constat ex significatione `pallii' quod sit Divinum Spirituale mediate procedens ex Divino Caelesti, ita medium regni spiritualis, de qua n. 9825; 
quod dicatur `pallium ephodi,' est quia pallium pertinebat ad ephodum, `distinguebatur etiam' a tunica per cingulum; erant enim duo cingula, unum commune pro ephodo et simul pallio, alterum pro tunica 
solum, quod significabat quod illa regni spiritualis, quae repraesentabantur per tunicam, distincta essent ab illis quae repraesentabantur per pallium et simul per ephodum; cingulum {1} seu balteus 
significat vinculum commune, per quod in nexu tenentur interiora, n. 9828, et quoque per quod separatur unum ab altero, n. (x)9944. 	[2] Cum his ita se habet: sunt tria quae ordine consequuntur seu 
succedunt; illa tria in caelis vocantur caeleste, spirituale, et naturale inde; caeleste est bonum amoris in Dominum, spirituale est bonum charitatis erga proximum, (c)ac naturale inde est bonum fidei; 
caeleste, quod est bonum amoris in Dominum, constituit intimum seu tertium caelum, spirituale, quod est bonum charitatis erga proximum, constituit medium seu secundum caelum, et naturale inde, quod 
est bonum fidei, constituit ultimum seu primum caelum; quoniam vestes Aharonis repraesentabant regnum spirituale Domini, n. 9814, ex dictis patet quid tunica repraesentavit, et quid pallium, ac (o)quid 
ephodum, quod nempe tunica repraesentaverit medium uniens regni spiritualis cum regno caelesti, quapropter etiam illa per cingulum distincta fuit a pallio et ephodo, quae repraesentabant regnum spirituale 
internum et externum; de tunica, videatur n. 9826, 9942, de pallio, n. 9825, et de ephodo, n. (x)9824. 	[3] Idea hujus rei etiam haberi potest ex illis quae de tentorio conventus, per quod repraesentatum 
est caelum in quo Dominus, prius ostensa sunt; per intimum ejus, ubi arca testimonii, repraesentatum est intimum seu tertium caelum, per habitaculum, quod erat extra velum, repraesentatum 
est medium seu secundum caelum, et per atrium tertium seu ultimum caelum; ita quoque caeleste, spirituale, et naturale inde; medium autem uniens caeli intimi et {2} medii repraesentabatur per velum inter 
sanctum et sanctum sanctorum, simile quod {3} per tunicam super Aharone; de intimo tentorii, ubi arca, videatur n. 9485, de habitaculo, quod extra velum, n. 9594, 9632, de atrio, n. 9741, et de velo, 
quod sit medium uniens caeli intimi et medii, n. 9670, 9671. {4} 	[4] Adhuc melior idea (o)de illis capi potest ex correspondentia hominis cum caelis, quod omnium quae apud hominem, correspondentia 
sit cum omnibus in caelis, videantur quae ad finem plurium capitum prius ostensa sunt; caput apud hominem correspondet intimo seu tertio caelo, ubi est caeleste bonum, pectus usque ad lumbos correspondet 
medio seu secundo caelo, ubi est spirituale bonum, ac pedes correspondent ultimo seu primo caelo, ubi est naturale bonum; collum autem ex correspondentia est medium uniens intimi caeli et medii, 
n. 9913, 9914; similiter ac velum in tentorio {5}; nam omnia repraesentativa in natura se referunt ad formam humanam, et secundum relationem ad illam significant, n. 9496.  Ex his nunc constare potest 
cur tunica per cingulum distincta fuit a pallio (c)et ephodo, et quoque cur pallium dicitur `pallium ephodi.' @1 i enim$ @2 ac coeli$ @3 i repraesentatum est$ @4 i et quod similiter tunica quae
