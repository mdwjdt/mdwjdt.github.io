<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8658节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8658.</strong>“就是摩西在神的山安营的地方”表接近真理之良善。这从“安营”和“神的山”的含义清楚可知：“安营”是指对与人同在的教会的真理和良善的有序排列（参看<a href="8103.htm">8103</a>e，<a href="8130.htm">8130</a>，<a href="8131.htm">8131</a>，<a href="8155.htm">8155</a>节）；“神的山”是指爱之良善（参看<a href="795.htm">795</a>，<a href="796.htm">796</a>，<a href="2722.htm">2722</a>，<a href="4210.htm">4210</a>，<a href="6435.htm">6435</a>，<a href="8327.htm">8327</a>节），在此是指真理之良善，因为所论述的主题是“以色列人”所代表的那些属于属灵教会之人的良善。他们所拥有的良善是真理之良善，该良善也是仁之良善。这也解释了“神的山”这个词语，因为当论述真理时，经上就用“神”，当论述良善时，经上就用“耶和华”（<a href="2586.htm">2586</a>，<a href="2769.htm">2769</a>，<a href="2807.htm">2807</a>，<a href="2822.htm">2822</a>，<a href="3921.htm">3921</a>e，<a href="4295.htm">4295</a>，<a href="4402.htm">4402</a>，<a href="7268.htm">7268</a>，<a href="7873.htm">7873</a>节）。由此明显可知，“摩西在神的山安营”表示对接近真理之良善的教会的良善和真理的有序排列。<br />必须简要阐述一下当如何理解这一切。<br />当一个人处于第一种状态时，也就是说，当他通过真理行事，还没有通过良善行事时，即当他通过信行事，还没有通过仁行事时，他处于经历试探的状态。他通过这些试探逐步被带入第二种状态，即他通过良善，也就是通过仁和属于它的情感行事所在的状态。因此，当他接近这种状态时，就说他“在神的山安营”，也就是在后来他的行为所源自的良善安营。之所以这样说，是因为接下来论述的主题是为了进入这种状态而对真理的一种新排列或重整，教会成员在经历试探之后，神的律法写在他们心上之前就会来到这种状态。在此之前所论述的主题一直是试探，接下来论述的主题则是从西乃山上所颁布的律法，“西乃山”是指含有真理在里面的良善。</p>

Where he was encamped at the mount of God. That this signifies near to the good of truth, is evident from the signification of "being encamped," as being the setting in order of the truth and good which 
are of the church with man (see n. 8103, 8130, 8131, 8155); and from the signification of "the mount of God," as being the good of love (see n. 795, 796, 2722, 4210, 6435, 8327), here the good of 
truth, because the subject treated of is the good of those who are of the spiritual church, who are represented by the sons of Israel. The good they have is the good of truth (this good is also the good 
of charity), and therefore it is called "the mount of God," because "God" is said where truth is treated of, and "Jehovah" where good is treated of (n. 2586, 2769, 2807, 2822, 3921, 4295, 4402, 7268, 
7873). From all this it is evident that by "he was encamped at the mount of God," is signified the setting in order of the good and truth of the church near to the good of truth. What is meant by this 
shall be briefly told. When man is in the former state, namely, when he acts from truth and not yet from good, that is, when he acts from faith and not yet from charity, he is in a state of undergoing 
temptations. By these he is progressively carried to the second state, namely, that he acts from good, that is, from charity and the affection of it. When therefore he comes near to this state, he 
is said to be "encamped at the mount of God," that is, at the good from which he will afterward act. This is said because in what now follows the subject treated of is the new disposition or setting 
in order of the truths for entering into this state, to which the man of the church comes after he has undergone temptations, and before the law Divine is inscribed on his heart. In what precedes the 
subject treated of was temptations, and in what now follows it is the law promulgated from Mount Sinai. "Mount Sinai" denotes the good in which is truth. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8658</b></p><p><b>8658.</b>
'Where he was encamped at the mountain of God' means near to the good of truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'encamping' as an arrangement into order of the Church's truth and good with a person, 
dealt with in <a href="8103.htm">8103</a> (end), <a href="8130.htm">8130</a>, <a href="8131.htm">8131</a>, <a href="8155.htm">8155</a>; and from the meaning of 'the mountain of God' as the good of love, dealt with in <a href="795.htm">795</a>, <a href="796.htm">796</a>, <a href="2722.htm">2722</a>, <a href="4210.htm">4210</a>, <a href="6435.htm">6435</a>, <a href="8327.htm">8327</a>, at this point the good of truth, since 
the subject is the good of those belonging to the spiritual Church, who are represented by 'the children of Israel'. Good as it exists with them is the good of truth, and this good is also the good of 
charity. This also accounts for the words 'the mountain of God', for 'God' is used when truth is the subject, and 'Jehovah' when good is the subject, <a href="2586.htm">2586</a>, <a href="2769.htm">2769</a>, <a href="2807.htm">2807</a>, <a href="2822.htm">2822</a>, <a href="3921.htm">3921</a> (end), <a href="4295.htm">4295</a>, <a href="4402.htm">4402</a>, <a href="7268.htm">7268</a>, <a href="7873.htm">7873</a>. From all this it is evident that 'he was encamped at the mountain of God' means an arrangement into order of the Church's good and truth near to the good of truth. </p>

 How to understand 
all this must also be stated briefly. When a person is in the first state, that is to say, when his actions spring from truth but not as yet from good, that is, when they spring from faith but not as 
yet from charity, he is in the state in which temptations have to be undergone. By means of these he is brought step by step to the second state - to the one in which his actions spring from good, that 
is, from charity and the affection belonging to it. When therefore he is getting near to that state he is said 'to be encamped at the mountain of God', that is, at the good from which his actions later 
on spring. This is said because what follows refers to a new arrangement or re-ordering of truths for entrance into that state, to which members of the Church also come after they have undergone temptations 
and before God's law is written on their hearts. In what has gone before temptations have been the subject, and in what now follows the subject is the law issued from Mount Sinai, 'Mount Sinai' 
being good which holds truth within it. </p>

`Ubi ille castrametatus montem Dei': quod significet juxta bonum veri, constat ex significatione `castrametari' quod sit ordinatio veri et boni, quae Ecclesiae apud hominem, de qua n. 8103 fin., 8130, 
813, 8155, et ex significatione `montis Dei' quod sit bonum amoris, de qua n. 795, 796, 2722, 4210, 6435, 8327, hic bonum veri, quia agitur de bono illorum qui ab Ecclesia spirituali sunt, qui per 
`filios Israelis' repraesentantur; {1} bonum quod illis est bonum veri, hoc bonum est etiam bonum charitatis; ideo etiam {2}vocatur `mons Dei,' quia `Deus' dicitur ubi agitur de vero, et `Jehovah' ubi 
de bono, n. 2586, 2769, 2807, 2822, 3921 fin., 4295, 4402, 7268, 7873; ex his patet quod per `castrametatus ad montem Dei' significetur ordinatio boni et veri quae Ecclesiae juxta bonum veri.  Quid per 
hoc intelligitur, 2 etiam paucis dicendum est: quando homo in priore statu est, nempe {3}quando ex vero agit et nondum ex bono, hoc est, cum ex fide et nondum ex charitate, in statu subeundi tentationes 
est; per has progressive {4} fertur ad alterum statum, nempe ut ex bono, hoc est, ex charitate et ejus affectione agat; cum itaque prope ad illum statum venit, tunc dicitur `castrametari ad montem 
Dei,' hoc est, ad bonum ex quo {5}postea aget.  Hoc dicitur quia in (t)nunc sequentibus agitur de nova dispositione seu ordinatione verorum, ad ineundum illum statum, ad quem statum etiam venit homo 
Ecclesiae postquam tentationes subiverat, et antequam lex Divina cordibus inscribitur; in praecedentibus de tentationibus actum est, et in nunc sequentibus agitur de lege promulgata e monte Sinai; `mons 
Sinai' est bonum {6}in quo verum. 	@1 i et$ 	@2 ducitur$ 	@3 cum$ 	@4 i magis$ 	@5 postmodum acturus$ 	@6 a$ </p>
