<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3344.</strong>属于更内在的天堂，也就第三层天堂的天使的交流虽然也是代表，但却是无法以任何思想观念来想象的那一类，因此无法描述。他们的思维模式也内在地存在于人里面，不过只存在于处于属天之爱，即对主之爱的人里面；脱离肉身后，他便进入这种思维模式中，如同生在其中，尽管如前所述，活在肉身时，他对此根本无法以头脑中的任何观念来理解。简言之，通过与观念联结的代表，交流仿佛活过来。在这种交流所取的一切形式中，世人所具有的那类形式是最没有活力的，因为他们交流形式牵涉话语。它在第一层天的天使当中所取的形式较为有活力，在第二层天的天使当中所取的形式更有活力，在第三层天的天使当中所取的形式则最有活力，因为比起其他人，这些天使能更充分地接受主的生命。凡出自主的，本身都是活的。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3344</b></p><p><b>3344.</b>
But the speech of the angels of the still more interior or third heaven, although also representative, is yet such as to be inconceivable by any idea, and consequently is indescribable. Even this perfect 
form of speech [idea] is also within man, but in the man who is in celestial love, that is, in love to the Lord; and after the separation of the body he comes into it as if born into it, although 
as before said nothing of it could be comprehended by him under any idea during his life in the body. In short, by means of representatives adjoined to ideas, speech becomes as it were alive; least of 
all with man, because he is in the speech of words; but more so with the angels of the first heaven; still more so with the angels of the second heaven; and most of all with the angels of the third 
heaven, because these are most nearly in the Lord's life. In itself whatever is from the Lord is alive. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3344</b></p><p><b>3344.</b>
The communication of angels who belong to the heaven more interior still, which is the third heaven, is also representative, but it is such as cannot possibly be conceived by any idea in the mind, nor 
accordingly be described. Their pattern of thought is present inwardly in man, yet only in one in whom celestial love, that is, love to the Lord, is present; and following his separation from the body 
he enters into that pattern of thought as though born to it, even though, as has been stated, he could not conceive anything at all of this with any idea present in his own mind while he was living 
in the body. In short, by means of the representatives that are combined with ideas, communication so to speak comes to life. Of all the forms this communication takes, that among men is the least lively 
because their form of it involves spoken words. The form it takes among angels of the first heaven is more lively, that among angels of the second is more lively still, while that among angels of 
the third heaven is the most lively of all, since these angels receive the Lord's life more fully than others. Whatever comes from the Lord is in itself living. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 3344</b>
</p><b>3344.</b>
Loquela autem angelorum adhuc interioris seu tertii caeli est quoque repraesentativa, sed talis ut nusquam aliqua idea capi possit, ita nec describi. Etiam haec idea intus est in homine, sed in illo 
qui in amore caelesti est, hoc est, in amore in Dominum; ac post separationem corporis in illam, sicut natus in illam, venit, tametsi nihil ejus aliqua idea, ut dictum, capi ab ipso potuerit quamdiu 
vixit in corpore. (m)Verbo, per repraesentativa adjuncta ideis vivit quasi loquela, {1}omnium minime apud hominem quia in loquela vocum est; magis apud angelos primi caeli; adhuc magis apud angelos secundi; 
maxime autem apud angelos tertii caeli, nam hi proxime in vita Domini sunt; {2}quicquid a Domino, in se vivum est.(n) @1 i sed$  @2 i nam$  </p>
