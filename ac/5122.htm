<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5122节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5122.</strong>“三根枝子就是三天”表连续不断的衍生物，甚至直到最后的衍生物。这从“三”、“枝子”和“天”的含义清楚可知：“三”是指一个周期，及其从开始到结束的持续过程（<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="4495.htm">4495</a>节）；“枝子”是指衍生物（<a href="5114.htm">5114</a>节）；“天”是指状态（<a href="23.htm">23</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="488.htm">488</a>，<a href="493.htm">493</a>，<a href="893.htm">893</a>，<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="3462.htm">3462</a>，<a href="3785.htm">3785</a>，<a href="4850.htm">4850</a>节）。由此可知，“三根枝子就是三天”表示“酒政”所代表的感官能力，从其最初层级直到最末层级所经历的状态；“枝子”表示其连续的衍生物。各感官能力和属世层的各个方面，以及理性层的各个方面所经历的重生状态从开始直到结束，都有自己的渐进阶段。当达到某个目的时，它们便在此开始某种新的东西，或说从一种新的开始着手，也就是说，从它们在之前状态下所奋力达到的目的到实现进一步的目的，以此类推。最终，次序被颠倒过来，然后为末的成了为首的。这就是人在重生时所发生的情形，无论是他的理性层，还是他的属世层。当人的重生正在进行时，构成第一个状态的阶段是从信之真理走向仁之良善的阶段；这时，信之真理看似起主导作用，而仁之良善则看似起次要作用；因为信之真理以仁之良善为它们的目的。像这样的阶段会持续到此人完成重生。一旦完成重生，仁爱就从最后一位挪到第一位，从而成为新状态的起点。这些状态朝两个方向发展：一个越发内在的方向，一个越发外在的方向。朝向前者就朝向对主之爱，朝向后者就是朝向信之真理，然后朝向属世真理，之后朝向感官真理。这时，真理的这三个层级被相继带入与理性层中的仁与爱之良善的对应或一致中，因而被带入天上的次序。<br />这些就是发展的渐进阶段，以及连续的衍生物，甚至直到最后的衍生物所表示的事。对正在重生的人来说，这样的阶段和衍生物是永远止境的，从幼年开始，一直持续到其在世生命的最后一刻，然后直到永远；然而，他的重生永远不可能达到无论从哪个意义上说能称得上完美的地步。因为无论在他的理性层里面，还是在他的属世层里面，要重生的事物不计其数，甚至数量无限多。那里的每一个事物都有无限分支，也就是朝内在和外在方向发展和衍生的阶段。人对这一切根本一无所知；但主知道每一个具体细节，并且时时刻刻为它做准备。如果主有一瞬间的停顿，那么每一个发展阶段都会陷入混乱。因为一个阶段在一个无尽的序列中关注下一个阶段，并产生永不停止的顺序链。由此明显可知，神性预见和神性眷顾存在于每一个具体细节中；若它们不这样做，或仅以一种总体的方式这样做，人类必要灭亡。</p>

The three shoots three days are these. That this signifies continuous derivations down to the last or ultimate one, is evident from the signification of "three," as being one period and its continuation 
from beginning to end (n. 2788, 4495); from the signification of "shoots," as being derivations (n. 5114); and from the signification of "days," as being states (n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788, 3462, 
3785, 4850). From this it follows that by "the three shoots three days are these" is signified the state of the rebirth of this sensuous which is represented by the butler, from its first down to 
its ultimate; its successive derivations being signified by the "shoots."  
 </p>
<p>[2] The states of the rebirth of each sensuous, and of each thing in the natural, and also in the rational, have their progressions 
from beginning to end; and when they come to the end they commence from a kind of new beginning, that is, from the end to which they had striven in the former state, to a further end; and so 
on; and at last the order is inverted, and then what was last becomes first, just as while man is being regenerated both as to the rational and as to the natural, the periods of the first state are from 
the truths which are of faith to the goods which are of charity; and then the truths of faith apparently act the first part, and the goods of charity the second, for the truths of faith look to the 
good of charity as their end. These periods continue even until the man has been regenerated. Afterward charity, which was the end, becomes the beginning, and from it new states commence, which proceed 
in both directions, namely, toward what is still more interior, and also toward what is exterior; toward the former being toward love to the Lord, and toward the latter being toward the truths of faith, 
and further toward natural truths, and also toward sensuous truths, which are then successively reduced to correspondence with the goods of charity and of love in the rational, and thus into heavenly 
order.
 </p>
<p>[3] These are the things which are meant by continuous progressions and derivations down to the ultimate one. Such progressions and derivations with the man who is being regenerated are 
perpetual, from his infancy even to the last hour of his life in the world, and also afterward even to eternity; and yet he can never be so regenerated that he can in any way be said to be perfect; for 
there are things to be regenerated that are innumerable, nay, illimitable in number, both in the rational and in the natural, and everyone of them has shoots illimitable, that is, progressions and derivations 
toward interior things and toward exterior things. Man knows nothing at all of this; but the Lord knows all things and every single thing, and provides for them every moment. If He were to 
pause even for an instant, all the progressions would be disturbed; for what is prior looks to what follows in a continuous series, and produces series of consequences to eternity. From this it is plain 
that the Divine foresight and providence are in everything, even the very least; and that unless this were so, or if they were only universal, the human race would perish. </p>

'The three shoots are three days' means continuous derivatives even to the final one. This is clear from the meaning of 'three' as a single period and the continuity of it from start to finish, dealt 
with in <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="4495.htm">4495</a>; from the meaning of 'shoots' as derivatives, dealt with in <a href="5114.htm">5114</a>; and from the meaning of 'days' as states, dealt with in <a href="23.htm">23</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="488.htm">488</a>, <a href="493.htm">493</a>, <a href="893.htm">893</a>, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="3462.htm">3462</a>, <a href="3785.htm">3785</a>, <a href="4850.htm">4850</a>. From all this 
it follows that 'the three shoots are three days' means the state in which the sensory power represented by 'the cupbearer' undergoes rebirth, from the first to the final degrees of it, its consecutive 
derivatives being meant by 'shoots'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The states of rebirth which each sensory power and every aspect of the natural, as well as every aspect of the rational, pass through have from beginning 
to end their own progressive stages. When they attain any end they also begin at that point something else that is new; that is to say, they pass on from the end they had been striving to attain in 
a prior state to the realization of some further end, and so on after that. Eventually order is turned around, so that what has been last becomes first. This is what happens when a person is being regenerated, 
both in the case of his rational and in that of his natural. While his regeneration is taking place the phases that make up the first state are the stages of a movement from the truths of 
faith towards forms of the good of charity, when the truths of faith seemingly play the leading role while forms of the good of charity play a secondary one; for the truths of faith have the good of charity 
as their end in view. Phases like these continue until the person's regeneration is completed. Once this is completed charity then moves from the final place to the first in the line, and so becomes 
the point from which new states begin. These states develop in two directions - in an increasingly inward direction and also in a more outward one. Inwardly they move closer to love to the Lord, 
while outwardly they move closer first to the truths of faith, then to natural truths, and after that to truths as these are perceived by the senses. Then these three degrees of truths are brought into 
agreement one after another with forms of the good of charity and love present within the rational and so are brought into heavenly order. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 These are the matters that are meant by progressive 
stages of development and by continuous derivatives even to the final one. Such stages and derivatives are unending in the case of a person who is being regenerated. They begin when he is a young child 
and continue through to the final phase of his life in the world; indeed they continue for ever after that, though his regeneration can never reach the point when he can by any means be called perfect. 
For there are countless, indeed a limitless number of things to be regenerated, both within his rational and within his natural. Everything there has limitless shoots, that is, stages of development 
and derivatives that progress in both inward and outward directions. A person has no immediate awareness at all of this, but the Lord is aware of every particular detail and is making provision for 
it moment by moment. If He were to stop doing this for a single instant every stage of development would be thrown into confusion. For one stage looks to the next in an unending sequence and produces 
chains of sequences which never cease. From this it is evident that Divine Foresight and Providence exist in every particular detail, and that if they did not, or did so in a merely overall way, the 
human race would perish. </p>

`Tres propagines tres dies illae':  quod significet derivationes continuas usque ad ultimam, constat ex significatione `trium' quod sit una periodus et ejus continuum a principio ad finem, de qua 
n. 2788, 4495; a significatione `propaginum' quod sint derivationes, de qua n. 5114; et a significatione `dierum' quod sint status, de qua n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788, 3462, 3785, 4850; inde sequitur 
quod per `tres propagines tres dies illae' significetur status renascentiae sensualis hujus quod per `pincernam' repraesentatur, a primo ejus ad ultimum; ejus derivationes successivae significantur 
per `propagines'.  [2] Status renascentiae cujusvis sensualis et cujusvis rei in naturali, ut et in rationali, suas progressiones a principio ad finem habent, et cum finem, tunc a quodam novo 
incohant, nempe a fine illo ad quem in priore statu tetenderunt, ad finem ulteriorem, et sic porro; et tandem invertitur ordo, et tunc quod fuit ultimum, fit primum; sicut cum regeneratur homo 
tam quoad rationale quam quoad naturale, tunc periodi primi status sunt a veris quae fidei ad bona quae charitatis, et tunc vera fidei apparenter primas agunt, et bona charitatis secundas, nam vera 
fidei spectant bonum charitatis ut finem; hae periodi perstant usque dum homo regeneratus est; </p>
<p>postmodum charitas quae fuit finis, fit principium, et ab illa status novi incohant, qui procedunt utrinque, 
nempe versus interiora magis, ut et versus exteriora, versus interiora ad amorem in Dominum, et versus exteriora ad vera naturalia, et quoque ad vera sensualia, quae tunc successive ad correspondentiam 
cum bonis charitatis et amoris in rationali rediguntur, ac ita in ordinem caelestem; [3] haec sunt quae intelliguntur per progressiones et derivationes continuas usque ad ultimam; {1} 
tales progressiones et derivationes sunt perpetuae apud hominem qui regeneratur, ab infantia ejus usque ad ultimum vitae ejus in mundo, et quoque postea usque in aeternum, et tamen nusquam ita regenerari 
potest ut aliquo modo dici queat perfectus; sunt enim innumerabilia, immo numero indefinita quae regeneranda, tam in rationali quam in naturali, et quodlibet (c)eorum (t)numero indefinitas propagines habet, 
hoc est, progressiones et derivationes versus interiora et versus exteriora; hoc homo prorsus nescit, sed Dominus Omnia et singula novit, et unoquovis momento providet; si intermitteret solummodo 
uno minutulo, turbarentur omnes progressiones; prius enim spectat sequens in continua serie, et producit consequentiarum series in aeternum; inde patet quod Divina {2}Praevidentia et Providentia 
sit in singularissimis, et nisi foret, aut si foret modo universalis, periret genus humanum. @1 i et$ @2 Providentia I$ </p>
