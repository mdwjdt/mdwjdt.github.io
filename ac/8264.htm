<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8264节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8264.</strong>“因祂高举自己”表祂已经在祂的人性里面彰显了神性。这从“举起自己”的含义清楚可知，“高举自己”在论及主时，是指在人性里面彰显神性。“高举自己”之所以具有这种含义，是因为神性是至高或至高无上的；当主在世时，祂在自己里面将人身变成神性，由此“高高举起自己”。在圣言中，“高”或高的东西表示神性或神性之物（参看<a href="8153.htm">8153</a>节）。此处经上之所以说“因祂高举自己”，以此表示在人性里面彰显神性，是因为这歌的主题是主，以及在将祂的人身变成神性之后，祂如何将恶人投入地狱，将善人提上天堂（<a href="8258.htm">8258</a>节），祂做这种事仅凭祂的同在（<a href="7989.htm">7989</a>节）；因为仅凭同在而将恶人投入地狱，将善人提上天堂是一种神性成就。</p>

Because exalting He hath exalted. That this signifies that He has manifested His Divine in the Human, is evident from the signification of "exalting oneself," when said of the Lord, as being to manifest 
the Divine in the Human. The reason why this is signified by "exalting He hath exalted Himself," is that the Divine is the Highest or Supreme; and the Lord, when He was in the world, made the Human 
in Himself Divine, and thus "exalting He exalted." (That by what is "high" in the Word is signified what is Divine, see n. 8153.) It is here said that "exalting He hath exalted," and that thereby is 
signified the manifestation of the Divine in the Human, because in this song the subject treated of is the Lord, in that after He made His Human Divine, He cast the evil into the hells and raised the 
good into heaven (n. 8258), and this by His mere presence (n. 7989); for to cast the evil into the hells, and to raise the good into heaven, by mere presence, is Divine. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8264</b></p><p><b>8264.</b>
'For He has highly exalted [Himself]' means that He has displayed His Divinity within His Humanity. This is clear from the meaning of 'exalting Himself', when it refers to the Lord, as displaying His 
Divinity within His Humanity. The reason why 'highly exalting Himself' has this meaning is that what is Divine is Highest or Supreme, and when the Lord was in the world He made the Human within Himself 
Divine and in so doing 'highly exalted [Himself]'. For the meaning of 'high' in the Word as Divine, see <a href="8153.htm">8153</a>. Here the words used are 'has highly exalted', by which displaying Divinity within Humanity 
is meant. </p>
<p>Such is their meaning because the theme of this song is the Lord and how, after making Divine His Human, He cast the evil into hell and raised the good to heaven, <a href="8258.htm">8258</a>, which He did simply 
by His presence, <a href="7989.htm">7989</a>; for casting the evil into hell and raising the good to heaven, simply by being present, is a Divine accomplishment. </p>

</p><b>8264.</b>
`Quia exaltando exaltavit': quod significet quod manifestaverit Divinum Suum in Humano, constat ex significatione `exaltare se,' cum de Domino, quod sit manifestare Divinum in Humano; causa quod per 
`exaltando exaltavit se' id significetur, est quia Divinum est Altissimum seu Supremum, ac Dominus cum in mundo fuit, Humanum in Se Divinum fecit, ac ita `exaltando exaltavit'; quod per `altum' in Verbo 
significetur Divinum, videatur n. 8153; hic dicitur `exaltando exaltavit,' et per id significatur {1}manifestatio Divini in Humano, quia in cantico hoc agitur de Domino quod postquam Humanum Suum 
Divinum fecit, malos {2}conjecerit in inferna, et bonos elevaverit in caelum, n. 8258, et hoc per solam praesentiam Suam, {3}n. 7989, (d)nam malos conjicere in inferna et bonos elevare in {4}caelum, per 
(x)solam praesentiam, est Divinum. 	@1 Divinum$ 	@2 dejecerit$ 	@3 de qua re in capite praeced.$ 	@4 coelum altered to coelos$ </p>
