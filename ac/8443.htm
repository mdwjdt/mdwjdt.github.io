<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8443节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8443.</strong>“看哪，耶和华的荣耀在云中显现”表主出现在适合他们觉知的真理中。这从“耶和华的荣耀”和“云”的含义清楚可知：“耶和华的荣耀”是指主的出现和降临（参看<a href="8427.htm">8427</a>节）；“云”是指圣言的字义 （参看创世记18章序言，<a href="4391.htm">4391</a>，<a href="5922.htm">5922</a>，<a href="6343.htm">6343</a>e，<a href="6752.htm">6752</a>，<a href="8106.htm">8106</a>节），因而是指适合人们觉知的真理，因为文字上的圣言就是这种真理。但“云中的荣耀”是指神性真理，这真理并非如此适合人们的觉知，因为它远在感官幻觉和表象之上；因此，它也指圣言的内义（参看创世记18章序言，<a href="5922.htm">5922</a>，<a href="8427.htm">8427</a>节）。“荣耀”之所以指圣言的内义，是因为内义论述教会和主的国度，至高意义则论述主自己，这层意义还包含绝对的神性真理。<br />神的真理不是只有一个层次，而是有许多层次。神之真理的第一层，以及第二层是直接从主发出的真理；它在天使的理解力之上。但神之真理的第三层是诸如存在于至内层或第三层天堂中的那种真理；其性质是这样：人丝毫理解不了它。神之真理的第四层就是诸如存在于中间层或第二层天堂中的那种；该真理也是人所理解不了的。但神之真理的第五层是诸如存在于最低层或第一层天堂中的那种真理；这种真理能在某种很小的程度上被人感知，但前提是他得到启示；尽管如此，它仍具有这样的性质，它大部分是人类的语言无法表达的；当它降至观念时，就会产生感知它，而且相信它的确是真理的那种能力。但神之真理的第六层是诸如存在于人身上的那种；它适合人的觉知；因此，它是圣言的字义。这字义或这种真理由“云”来代表，而内层真理则由“云中的荣耀”来代表。<br />这解释了为何耶和华，也就是主，多次在云中向摩西和以色列人显现（参看出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出24.15.htm">24:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出24.16.htm">16</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出40.34.htm">40:34</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出40.35.htm">35</a>；列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上8.10.htm">8:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上8.11.htm">11</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.30.htm">24:30</a>等）。主通过神性真理显现，事实上这种显现就是神性真理。“云”表示适合人类觉知的真理，这层含义来源于来世的代表。在那里，高层天堂的天使言语向下面的人显为光，还显为光所发出的光辉；而低层天堂的天使言语则显为亮云，其形状各式各样，其厚薄取决于真理的品质。由此可见，“耶和华的荣耀在云中显现”表示主在适合他们觉知的真理里面的出现。</p>

And behold the glory of Jehovah was seen in the cloud. That this signifies the presence of the Lord in truth accommodated to the perception, is evident from the signification of "the glory of Jehovah," 
as being the presence and the advent of the Lord (see above, n. 8427); and from the signification of "the cloud," as being the literal sense of the Word (see the preface to Genesis 18, and n. 4391, 
5922, 6343e, 6752, 8106), thus truth accommodated to the perception, for the Word in the letter is such truth. But "the glory which is in the cloud" denotes Divine truth which is not so accommodated 
to the perception, because it is above the fallacies and appearances of the senses, thus it also denotes the internal sense of the Word (see the preface to Genesis 18, and n. 5922, 8427). That "glory" 
denotes the internal sense of the Word, is because in this sense the Lord's church and kingdom are treated of, and in the supreme sense the Lord Himself, in which sense also is the veriest Divine truth. 
Truth Divine is not of one degree, but of many. Truth Divine in the first degree, and also in the second, is that which proceeds immediately from the Lord; this is above the angelic understanding. 
But truth Divine in the third degree is such as is in the inmost or third heaven; this is such that it cannot in the least be apprehended by man. Truth Divine in the fourth degree is such as is in the 
middle or second heaven; neither is this intelligible to man. But truth Divine in the fifth degree is such as is in the ultimate or first heaven; this can be perceived in some small measure by man provided 
he is enlightened; but still it is such that a great part of it cannot be expressed by human words; and when it falls into the ideas, it produces the faculty of perceiving and also of believing 
that the case is so. But truth Divine in the sixth degree is such as is with man, accommodated to his perception; thus it is the sense of the letter of the Word. This sense, or this truth, is represented 
by the cloud, and the interior truths are represented by the glory in the cloud. This is the reason why Jehovah (that is, the Lord) so often appeared to Moses and to the sons of Israel in a cloud 
(see Exod. 24:15, 16; 40:34, 35; 1 Kings 8:10, 11; Matt. 24:30; and other places). The appearing of the Lord is by means of Divine truth, and moreover is Divine truth. That a "cloud" denotes truth accommodated 
to the perception, is from the representatives in the other life, where angelic speech of the higher heavens appears to those who are beneath as light, and also as the brightness from light; 
whereas the speech of the angels of a lower heaven appears as a bright cloud, in form various, and in density or rarity according to the quality of the truths. From all this it can be seen that by 
"the glory of Jehovah seen in the cloud" is signified the presence of the Lord in truth accommodated to the perception. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8443</b></p><p><b>8443.</b>
'And behold, the glory of Jehovah was seen in the cloud' means the Lord's presence within truth adjusted to their discernment. This is clear from the meaning of 'the glory of Jehovah' as the presence 
and arrival of the Lord, dealt with above in <a href="8427.htm">8427</a>; and from the meaning of 'the cloud' as the literal sense of the Word, dealt with in the Preface to Genesis <a href="18.htm">18</a>, and in <a href="4391.htm">4391</a>, <a href="5922.htm">5922</a>, <a href="6343.htm">6343</a> (end), <a href="6752.htm">6752</a>, <a href="8106.htm">8106</a>, thus truth adjusted to people's discernment, for the Word in the letter is that kind of truth. But 'the glory that is in the cloud' is Divine Truth, which is not adjusted in that way to people's 
discernment, because it is above illusions and appearances of the senses; so it is also the internal sense of the Word, Preface to Genesis <a href="18.htm">18</a>, and <a href="5922.htm">5922</a>, <a href="8427.htm">8427</a>. The reason why 'the glory' is the internal 
sense of the Word is that this sense deals with the Church and the Lord's kingdom, and the highest sense with the Lord Himself, which sense also contains Divine Truth in its absolute form. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 There 
are many levels of God's truth, not just one. The first level of God's truth, and also the second, is that truth going forth directly from the Lord; it is above angels' understanding But the third 
level of God's truth is that truth as it exists in the inmost or third heaven; its nature is such that man can grasp nothing whatever of it. The fourth level of God's truth is as it exists in the middle 
or second heaven; this is not intelligible to man either. But the fifth level of God's truth is that truth as it exists in the lowest or first heaven; this may to some small extent be perceived by 
man, but only if he is enlightened, though even then it is such that human language is incapable of expressing a large part of it When it passes into ideas it generates the ability to perceive it and 
also to believe that it is indeed the truth. But the sixth level of God's truth is as it exists with man; it is adjusted to his discernment, thus it is the sense of the letter of the Word. This sense 
or kind of truth is represented by 'the cloud' and inner truths by 'the glory in the cloud'.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 This explains why Jehovah, that is, the Lord, appeared so many times to Moses and the children of 
Israel in a cloud, as at <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2024:15,%2016;%2040:34,%2035;%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 24:15, 16; 40:34, 35; 1</a> Kings 8:10, <a href="11.htm">11</a>; Matt. 24:30; and elsewhere. When the Lord is making His appearance He does so through Divine Truth; indeed what is appearing is 
Divine Truth. The meaning of 'a cloud' as truth adjusted to human discernment has its origin in representatives in the next life. There the speech of angels in the higher heavens manifests itself to those 
below as light and also as the brilliance of light; but the speech of angels belonging to a lower heaven manifests itself as a bright cloud, the shape of which varies, and the thick or thin texture 
of which is determined by the character of truths. From all this it becomes clear that 'the glory of Jehovah was seen in the cloud' means the Lord's presence within truth adjusted to their discernment. </p>

`Et ecce gloria Jehovae visa in nube': quod significet praesentiam Domini in vero accommodato ad apperceptionem, constat ex significatione `gloriae Jehovae' quod sit praesentia et Adventus Domini, de 
qua supra n. 8427, et ex significatione `nubis' quod sit sensus litteralis Verbi, de qua Praefatio ad Gen. xviii et n. 4391, 5922, 6343 fin., 6752, 8106, ita verum accommodatum ad apperceptionem, nam 
Verbum in littera est tale verum; at `gloria quae in nube' est Divinum Verum quod non ita accommodatum est ad apperceptionem, quia est supra sensuum fallacias et apparentias, ita est quoque sensus internus 
Verbi, Praefatio ad Gen. xviii, n. 5922, 8427; quod `gloria' sit sensus internus Verbi, est quia in illo sensu agitur de Ecclesia et de regno Domini, et in supremo sensu de Ipso Domino, in quo 
sensu etiam est Ipsissimum Divinum Verum.  Verum Divinum non est 2 unius gradus sed plurium: verum Divinum in primo gradu et quoque in secundo est {1}quod immediate procedit a Domino; hoc supra intellectum 
angelicum est: verum autem Divinum in tertio gradu est quale est in intimo seu tertio caelo; hoc tale est ut ne hilum ejus ab homine capi possit: verum {2} Divinum in quarto gradu est quale est 
in medio seu secundo caelo; hoc nec intelligibile est homini: verum autem Divinum in quinto gradu est quale est in ultimo seu primo caelo; hoc aliquantisper ab homine, sed illustrato, percipi potest, 
at usque est tale ut multa ejus pars per voces humanas enuntiari nequeat, {3}et cum cadit in ideas, facit facultatem percipiendi, et quoque credendi quod ita sit: at verum Divinum in sexto gradu est 
quale est apud hominem, accommodatum ejus apperceptioni, ita est sensus litterae Verbi; hic sensus seu hoc verum {4}repraesentatur per `nubem,' et interiora vera 3 per `gloriam in nube'; inde est quod 
{5}Jehovah, hoc est, Dominus, toties apparuerit Moschi et filiis Israelis in nube, ut Exod. (x)xxiv 15, 16, xl 34, 35; 1 Reg. viii 10, 11; Matth. xxiv 30, et alibi; {6} apparitio Domini est per Divinum 
Verum, et quoque est Divinum Verum {7}.  Quod `nubes' sit verum accommodatum apperceptioni, est ex repraesentativis in altera vita; ibi loquela angelica superiorum caelorum apparet illis qui infra 
sunt sicut lux et quoque sicut splendor e luce, at loquela angelorum inferioris caeli apparet sicut nubes candida in varia forma, et in densitate et tenuitate secundum {8}} quale veritatum; ex his constare 
potest quod per `gloriam Jehovae visam in nube' significetur praesentia Domini in vero accommodato ad apperceptionem. 	@1 quale est$ 	@2 i autem$ 	@3 at$ 	@4 significatur$ 	@5 cum Jehovah,
