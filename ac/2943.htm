<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2943节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2943.</strong>“全都由城门出入，说”表教义，人通过教义而有信。这从“城门”和“城”的含义清楚可知：“城门”（gate）是指入口，因而是指引入之物，和“门”（door）一样（参看<a href="2145.htm">2145</a>，<a href="2152.htm">2152</a>，<a href="2356.htm">2356</a>，<a href="2385.htm">2385</a>节）；“城”是指信之真理（参看<a href="402.htm">402</a>，<a href="2268.htm">2268</a>，<a href="2449.htm">2449</a>，<a href="2451.htm">2451</a>，<a href="2712.htm">2712</a>节）。在古教会，各城市和后来以及现代的城市不一样。也就是说，一座城不是由众多个体集合或聚集组成的，而是各个独立的宗族共同居住在一起。有共同先祖的宗族组成一座城，如拿鹤城（亚伯拉罕的仆人给以撒娶利百加时便来到这城，创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创24.10.htm">24:10</a>）就是由那里的拿鹤宗族组成的；撒冷（Shalem），即示剑城（雅各从巴旦-亚兰起行后，便来到这城，创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创33.18.htm">33:18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/创33.34.htm">34</a>）则是那里哈抹和示剑的宗族组成的。那时的其它城市也一样。<br />由于他们从上古之人那里得知各民族和宗族代表天上的各个社群，因而代表爱与仁之物（<a href="685.htm">685</a>，<a href="1159.htm">1159</a>节），故当提及“城”而非宗族，“百姓或人民”（people）而非民族（nation）时，所表示的是构成信的真理。这也是为何“神的城”和“圣城”的真正意义表示对主的信；并且由于有围墙的城镇或城表信，故“城门”就表示教义，因为这些事物引向信。这在代表性的犹太教会也由坐在城门口并在那里审判的士师和长老们来表示。这从圣言的历史部分，以及撒迦利亚书明显看出来：<br />你们所应当行的乃是以下这些事：各人与邻舍说真话，在城门口按至理判断，作和平的裁判。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚8.16.htm">8:16</a>）<br />还有阿摩司书：<br />要恨恶邪恶，喜爱良善，在城门口确立公义。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩5.15.htm">5:15</a>）<br />“城门”还表示进入理性心智的地方，理性心智好比一座城（参看<a href="2851.htm">2851</a>节）。</p>

Of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying. That this signifies as to the doctrinal things through which there is faith, is evident from the signification of "gate," as being entrance, thus 
that which introduces (in like manner as "door," see n. 2145, 2152, 2356, 2385); and from the signification of "city," as being the truth of faith (see n. 402, 2268, 2449, 2451, 2712). Cities in the Ancient 
Church were not like the cities of later times and of the present day, that is, assemblages and gatherings of people; but they were the dwelling together of separate families. The family of one 
parent constituted a city, as for instance the city of Nahor (to which Abraham's servant came when he was to betroth Rebekah to Isaac, Gen. 24:10) was Nahor's family which was there; and Shalem, the 
city of Shechem (to which Jacob came when he journeyed from Paddan-aram, Gen. 33:18; 34) was the family of Hamor and Shechem, which was there; and so with the other cities of that time. [2] And as they 
had learned from the most ancient people that nations and families represented the heavenly societies, and thus the things of love and charity (n. 655, 1159), so when a "city" is mentioned instead 
of a family, and "people" instead of nation, truth is signified which is of faith. Hence also the "city of God" and the "holy city," in the genuine sense signify faith in the Lord; and as a walled town 
or city signified faith, the "gate" of the city signified doctrinal things, because these introduce to faith. This in the representative Jewish Church was also signified by the judges and the elders 
sitting in the gate of the city and judging there; as is plain from the historical parts of the Word; and also in Zechariah: </p>
<p>     These are the words that ye shall do: Speak ye every man the truth with 
his companion, judge truth and the judgment of peace in your gates (Zech. 8:16). Also in Amos: </p>
<p>     Hate the evil and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate (Amos 5:15). (That a "gate" 
also signifies the way of access to the rational mind, and that this mind is compared to a city, may be seen above, n. 2851.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2943</b></p><p><b>2943.</b>
'To all entering into the gate of his city, saying' means matters of doctrine through which one comes to faith. This is clear from the meaning of 'a gate' as a place of entry and so as that which, in 
the same way as a door, leads in, dealt with in <a href="2145.htm">2145</a>, <a href="2152.htm">2152</a>, <a href="2356.htm">2356</a>, <a href="2385.htm">2385</a>, and from the meaning of 'a city' as truth, which constitutes faith, dealt with in <a href="402.htm">402</a>, <a href="2268.htm">2268</a>, <a href="2449.htm">2449</a>, <a href="2451.htm">2451</a>, <a href="2712.htm">2712</a>. In the Ancient Church 
a city was not like the city of later or of modern times. That is to say, a city did not consist of a collection or gathering together of individuals but of separate families living side by side. 
A family descended from the same forefather constituted a city. The city of Nahor, for example, to which Abraham's servant went to betroth Rebekah to Isaac, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2024:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 24:10</a>, consisted of the family of Nahor 
which was there. And Shalem, the city of Shechem, to which Jacob came after his departure from Paddan Aram, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2033:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 33:18</a> and the whole of Chapter <a href="34.htm">34</a>, consisted of the family of Hamor and Shechem which 
was there. And the same was so with all other cities in those times. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 And as it had come down to them from the most ancient people that nations and families represented heavenly communities, 
and so the things of love and charity, <a href="685.htm">685</a>, <a href="1159.htm">1159</a>, therefore when a city is mentioned instead of a family, and a people instead of a nation, truth that constitutes faith is meant. It is also why in the 
genuine sense the city of God and the holy city mean faith in the Lord. And as 'a city' meant faith, 'the gate of the city' means matters of doctrine through which one comes to faith. The same was also 
meant in the Jewish representative Church by the judges and elders sitting in the gate of the city and giving judgement there, as is evident from historical sections of the Word, and also in Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
These 
are the things that you shall do: Speak the truth, everyone to his companion; judge in your gates the truth and the judgement of peace. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%208:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 8:16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in Amos, </p>
<blockquote>
Hate evil, and love 
good, and establish judgement in the gate. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%205:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 5:15</a>.

<p>'A gate' also means the place of entry into the rational mind, and the rational mind is compared to a city, see <a href="2851.htm">2851</a>. </p>

`Omnibus intrantibus portam urbis ejus, dicendo': quod significet quoad doctrinalia per quae fides, constat a significatione `portae' quod sit introitus, ita id quod introducit, similiter ac janua, 
de qua n. 2145, 2152, 2356, 2385; et a significatione `urbis' quod sit verum quod est fidei, de qua n. 402, 2268, (x)2449, 2451, 2712.  Urbes in Antiqua Ecclesia non fuerunt urbes sicut postea {1}et hodie, 
nempe coetus et congregationes, sed fuerunt cohabitationes separatarum familiarum; familia unius parentis constituebat urbem; sicut urbs Nahoris, ad quam servus Abrahami cum desponsaret Rebeccam 
Isaco, venit, Gen. xxiv 10, fuit familia Nahoris, quae ibi; et Shalem urbs Shechemi, ad quam Jacob cum ex Paddan Aram, alluit, Gen. xxxiii 18; xxxiv, erat familia Hamoris et Shechemi quae ibi; ita reliquae 
urbes illo tempore; [2] et quia ex antiquissimis habuerunt quod gentes et familiae repraesentarent societates caelestes, ita illa quae sunt amoris et charitatis, n. 685, 1159, inde cum loco familiae 
nominatur urbs, et loco gentis nominatur populus, significatur verum quod est fidei:  inde quoque civitas Dei et civitas sancta in genuino sensu significat fidem in Dominum:  et quia `urbs seu civitas' 
significabat fidem, `porta urbis' significabat doctrinalia, quia haec introducunt ad fidem.  Hoc quoque in Ecclesia repraesentativa Judaica significabatur per quod judices et seniores sederent 
in porta urbis et ibi judicarent, ut patet ab historicis Verbi, tum apud Zachariam,           Haec verba quae facietis, loquimini veritatem vir cum       socio, veritatem et judicium pacis judicate 
in portis vestris,      viii 16: </p>
<p>et apud Amos,           Odio habete malum, et amate bonum, et statuite in porta      judicium, v 15. Quod `porta' quoque significet aditum ad mentem rationalem, 
et quod mens illa comparetur `urbi,' videatur n. 2851. @1 seu$  </p>
