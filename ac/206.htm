<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第206节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>206.</strong>认为自己眼睛明亮，如神知道善恶的，不正是自我崇拜，自认学识渊博的人吗？然而，究竟谁更盲目呢？问一问，你会发现，他们不知道有灵魂存在，更谈不上信，对于属灵、属天的生命，他们一无所知。他们不承认永生，以为自己必如动物一样死去。他们也不承认主，只崇拜自己和世界。<br />三思而言的人，说有一位不可知的至高者掌管着万有。这些是他们的原则，私下里，他们以感官和知识，从许多方面来证实之，倘若可行，他们也公开宣告之。此等人愿意被视为神或智者，若问他们是否知道何为“无我”，他们必说，无我就是无有，因为人若无我，就什么也不是。若问他们是否知道何为凭主而活，他们必以为那是幻想。若问他们是否知道何为良知，他们必说，良知只是想象的产物，用于约束平民百姓。若问他们是否知道何为觉知，他们必要发笑，斥之为胡说八道。这就是他们的智慧，一群所谓“眼睛明亮”，如神一般的人。这些被他们认为显而易见的原则，是他们的起点，在此起点上，他们思索信的奥秘。其结果，岂不是黑暗的深渊？此等人，比任何人更是引诱世界的“蛇”。不过，当前一代尚未变得如此，那是后来的情况，是本章十四节到十九节所论述的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]206.</strong> What group of people believes more firmly that their eyes are open and that like God they can identify good and evil than those who admire themselves and at the same time boast a good secular education? But what group is more blind? Just ask them and you will find that they have no idea of the existence of spirit, let alone a belief in it. Spiritual life and heavenly life they know nothing about. Eternal life they do not acknowledge, since they believe they will die like brute animals. They positively refuse to recognize the Lord, worshiping themselves and the material world instead.{*1} Those who want to speak cautiously say that some Supreme Entity rules all things, although they do not know what it is.<br />[2] These are their principles, and privately they use many arguments from the senses and from the academic disciplines to prove them. They would do so publicly as well, if they dared.<br />Such people want to be recognized as gods or as fonts of wisdom, but if you ask them whether they know what it is to lack selfhood, they will answer that it is nonexistence; once deprived of it, they would be nothing. If you ask whether they know what it is to live from the Lord, they consider the concept a fantasy. If you inquired whether they knew what conscience was, they would describe it as nothing more than an imaginary something-or-other good for keeping the common people under control. If you inquired whether they knew what perception was they would do nothing but sneer and call it a sign of religious mania.<br />This is their wisdom. These are the people who have their eyes open; these are the people who are gods. Principles like these, which they consider clearer than daylight, are their starting points. From there they go on to reason about the mysteries of faith. What is the result but a chasm of the deepest darkness? Such people more than any are snakes that lead the world astray [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_206/bible_king-james-version_revelation_12_9" target=_top>Revelation 12:9</a>].<br />But the descendants of the earliest church were not yet like this. What verses <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_206/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_14-19" target=_top>14-19</a> of the current chapter say about them shows what they were later to become.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} In the phrase "worshiping ... the material world," Swedenborg does not mean that those in question literally build altars to worship anything, but rather that in their thinking they substitute material causes for processes otherwise viewed as requiring divine intervention; for example, the creation of the world. They hold that the material (or "natural") world is everything that exists; there is nothing transcendent or beyond that world. (These people were sometimes called Naturalists, a term that often has a different application today.) To Swedenborg "worshiping the material world" (or "worshiping nature") was shorthand for having no spiritual life whatsoever or, essentially, ascribing to atheism.

Who have a stronger belief that their eyes are open, and that as God they know what is good and evil, than those who love themselves, and at the same time excel in worldly learning? And yet who are more 
blind? Only question them, and it will be seen that they do not even know, much less believe in, the existence of spirit; with the nature of spiritual and celestial life they are utterly unacquainted; 
they do not acknowledge an eternal life; for they believe themselves to be like the brutes which perish; neither do they acknowledge the Lord, but worship only themselves and nature. Those among 
them who wish to be guarded in their expressions, say that a certain Supreme Existence [Ens] of the nature of which they are ignorant, rules all things. These are the principles in which they confirm 
themselves in many ways by things of sense and of memory-knowledge, and if they dared, they would do the same before all the universe. Although such persons desire to be regarded as gods, or as the wisest 
of men, if they were asked whether they know what it is not to have anything of their own, they would answer that it is to have no existence, and that if they were deprived of everything that is 
their own, they would be nothing. If they are asked what it is to live from the Lord, they think it a phantasy. If asked whether they know what conscience is, they would say it is a mere creature of the 
imagination, which may be of service in keeping the vulgar under restraint. If asked whether they know what perception is, they would merely laugh at it and call it enthusiastic rubbish. Such is their 
wisdom, such "open eyes" have they, and such "gods" are they. Principles like these, which they think clearer than the day, they make their starting-point, and so continue on, and in this way reason 
about the mysteries of faith; and what can be the result but an abyss of darkness? These above all others are the "serpents" who seduce the world. But this posterity of the Most Ancient Church was 
not as yet of such a character. That which became such is treated of from verse 14 to verse 19 of this chapter. </p>

Who are more convinced that they have had their eyes opened and that like God they know what good and evil are than people who love themselves and who at the same time possess worldly learning? Yet is 
anyone more blind than they are? Merely question them and it will be seen that they do not even know about, let alone believe in, the existence of the spirit. What spiritual and celestial life are, 
they do not know at all. Nor do they acknowledge the reality of eternal life, for they believe that when they die they will, like animals, cease to exist. The Lord they do not acknowledge at all; they 
worship themselves and nature solely. Those who wish to be more guarded in what they say speak of a Supreme Being ruling over everything, but do not know what that Being is.  </p>

 These are their basic 
assumptions which they confirm in a multitude of ways by means of sensory evidence and of facts which they have at their command. If they dared, they would even do it for all the world to see. Although 
such people wish to be acknowledged as gods, that is, as sages, they would reply, if asked whether they knew what having no proprium was, that it was having no being, and if deprived of proprium 
that they would be nothing. If asked what living from the Lord was, they would consider it to be a set of delusions. If questioned whether they knew what conscience was, they would say it is purely 
a figment of the imagination which can be of service in keeping the common people under control. If questioned whether they knew what perception was, they would do no more than laugh and call it some 
kind of emotionalism. This is the kind of wisdom they possess; these are the kind of opened eyes they have; and these are the kind of gods they are. Starting from assumptions such as these, which they 
imagine to be clear as daylight, they go further and in this way reason about mysteries of faith. And what can the outcome be but abysmal thick darkness? More than anybody else these are serpents who 
mislead the world. But this was not yet the nature of these descendants of the Most Ancient Church. Verses 14-19 Of this chapter deal with them when they had reached that point.  </p>

</p><b>206.</b>
Quinam magis se apertos habere oculos, et sicut Deus scire quid bonum et malum, credunt, quam qui se amant et simul ex mundo docti sunt? sed quis est caecior? Si consulantur modo, videbitur quod nec 
sciant, minus credant, quod detur spiritus: quid vita spiritualis et caelestis, prorsus ignorant: vitam aeternam nec agnoscunt, nam se credunt sicut bruta morituros: Dominum prorsus non agnoscunt, sed 
modo semet et naturam colunt: qui caute loqui volunt, dicunt Ens quoddam supremum, quod nesciunt quid sit, regere omnia.  [2] Haec sunt eorum principia, quae confirmant multis per sensualia et scientifica 
apud semet; si ausi essent, etiam facerent coram universo.  Tales, quamvis se pro diis seu sapientissimis agnosci volunt, si quaererentur num scirent quid non proprium, respondebunt quod sit non 
ens, si privarentur proprio quod nihil essent: si quaererentur quid a Domino vivere, cogitant esse phantasias: si interrogarentur num sciant quid conscientia, dicerent esse nihil aliud quam quoddam 
imaginarium, quod inservire possit pro vulgo ut teneatur in vinculo: si interrogarentur num scirent quid perceptio, nihil aliud facerent quam irriderent, et vocarent enthusiasticum quid. Talis est sapientia 
eorum; tales apertos oculos habent, et tales dii sunt: ex talibus principiis, quae clariora die putant esse, incohant, et procedunt, et sic ratiocinantur de mysteriis fidei.  Quid inde nisi abyssus 
caliginum?  Hi sunt serpentes prae aliis, qui seducunt mundum. Sed talis nondum fuit haec posteritas Ecclesiae Antiquissimae; at de qua agitur a vers. 14-19 hujus capitis, talis facta est. </p>
