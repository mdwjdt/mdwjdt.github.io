<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2362节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2362.</strong>“看哪，我有两个女儿，还没有亲近过男人”表对善与真的情感。这从“女儿”的含义清楚可知，“女儿”是指情感（参看<a href="489.htm">489</a>-<a href="491.htm">491</a>节）。她们“还没有亲近过男人”表虚假还没有玷污过她们，“男人”表理性真理，在反面意义上表虚假（<a href="265.htm">265</a>，<a href="749.htm">749</a>，<a href="1007.htm">1007</a>节）。情感有两种类型，即对良善的情感和对真理的情感（参看<a href="1997.htm">1997</a>节）。前者，即对良善的情感构成属天的教会，在圣言中被称为“锡安的女儿或女子”，或“锡安的处女”；而后者，即对真理的情感构成属灵的教会，在圣言中被称为“耶路撒冷的女子”。<br />如以赛亚书：<br />锡安的处女藐视你、嗤笑你；耶路撒冷的女子在你后面摇头。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛37.22.htm">37:22</a>；列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下19.21.htm">19:21</a>）<br />耶利米哀歌：<br />耶路撒冷的女子哪，我可用什么与你相比呢？锡安的处女哪，我可拿什么和你比较，好安慰你呢？（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.13.htm">2:13</a>）<br />弥迦书：<br />你这羊群的高台、锡安女子的山冈哪，从前的权柄，就是耶路撒冷女子的国权，必归与你。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥4.8.htm">4:8</a>）<br />西番雅书：<br />锡安的女子哪，应当欢呼。以色列阿，应当发声。耶路撒冷的女子哪，应当满心欢喜快乐。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番3.14.htm">3:14</a>）<br />撒迦利亚书：<br />锡安的女子哪，应当大大喜乐；耶路撒冷的女子哪，应当发声。看哪，你的王来到你这里！（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚9.9.htm">9:9</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.5.htm">21:5</a>；约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.15.htm">12:15</a>）<br />属天的教会，或主的属天国度被称为来自对良善的情感，即来自对主自己之爱的“锡安的女儿或女子”（参看以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.32.htm">10:32</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛16.1.htm">16:1</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛52.2.htm">52:2</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛62.11.htm">62:11</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.31.htm">4:31</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶6.2.htm">6:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶6.23.htm">23</a>；耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀1.6.htm">1:6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.1.htm">2:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.4.htm">4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.8.htm">8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.10.htm">10</a>；弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥4.10.htm">4:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥4.13.htm">13</a>；撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚2.10.htm">2:10</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗9.14.htm">9:14</a>）。属灵的教会，或主的属灵国度被称为来自对真理的情感，因而来自对邻之仁的“耶路撒冷的女子”（参看耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.15.htm">2:15</a>）。第一卷多次论述了这两种教会及其特征。<br />由于属天教会通过存在于对邻之爱中的对主之爱而存在，故它尤其好比未结婚的女子或处女。事实上，它也被称为“童女”，如启示录：<br />这些人未曾沾染妇女，他们原是童女。羔羊无论往哪里去，他们都跟随他，因为他们在神的宝座前没有瑕疵。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.4.htm">14:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.5.htm">5</a>）<br />这一点在犹太教会中也有所体现：承接圣职的不可娶寡妇，要娶处女为妻（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利21.13.htm">21:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利21.15.htm">15</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结44.22.htm">44:22</a>）。<br />由本节内容可以看出圣言在内义上何等纯洁。但它在文字上没有表现出来，如当读到“看哪，我有两个女儿，还没有亲近过男人，容我领她们出来给你们，就照你们看为好的对待她们吧！只是这两个人，不要向他们作什么”这些话时，人们只会想到淫秽的事，尤其那些过着邪恶生活的人。然而，通过所给出的解读明显可知，这些话在内义上何等贞洁，也就是说，它们表示对良善与真理的情感，以及不向主的神性和神圣施暴的人出于这些情感的享受所感知到的幸福。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2362</b></p><p><b>2362.</b>
Behold I pray I have two daughters who have not known man. That this signifies the affections of good and of truth, is evident from the signification of "daughters," as being affections (see n. 489-491). 
Their "not having known man" signifies that falsity had not contaminated them; for "man" [vir] signifies rational truth, as also in the opposite sense falsity (n. 265, 749, 1007). There are two affections, 
namely, of good and of truth (see n. 1997). The former, or the affection of good, constitutes the celestial church, and is called in the Word the "daughter of Zion," and also the "virgin daughter 
of Zion;" but the latter, or the affection of truth, constitutes the spiritual church, and is called in the Word the "daughter of Jerusalem." [2] As in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The virgin daughter of Zion 
hath despised thee, hath mocked at thee; after thee hath the daughter of Jerusalem shaken her head (Isa. 37:22; 2 Kings 19:21). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     What shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem; 
what shall I equal to thee, and comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion (Lam. 2:13). In Micah: </p>
<p>     Thou, O tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion, even to thee shall it come, and the 
former dominion shall come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem (Micah 4:8). In Zephaniah: </p>
<p>     Shout, O daughter of Zion; make a loud noise, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, 
O daughter of Jerusalem (Zeph. 3:14). In Zechariah: </p>
<p>     Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; make a loud noise, O daughter of Jerusalem; behold, thy King shall come unto thee (Zech. 9:9; Matt. 21:5; 
John 12:15). [3] That the celestial church, or the Lord's celestial kingdom, is called the "daughter of Zion" from the affection of good, that is, from love to the Lord Himself, may be seen further 
in Isaiah (10:32; 16:1; 52:2; 62:11; Jer. 4:31; 6:2, 23; Lam. 1:6; 2:1, 4, 8, 10; Micah 4:10, 13; Zech. 2:10; Ps. 9:14). And that the spiritual church, or the Lord's spiritual kingdom, is called the 
"daughter of Jerusalem" from the affection of truth, and thus from charity toward the neighbor, may be seen in Jeremiah (Lam. 2:15). Both of these churches and their characteristics have been treated 
of many times in volume 1. [4] From the fact that the celestial church is from love to the Lord in love toward the neighbor, it is likened especially to an unmarried daughter or virgin, and indeed 
is also called a "virgin," as in John: </p>
<p>     These are they who have not been defiled with women, for they are virgins; these are they that follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth, for they are without 
spot before the throne of God (Rev. 14:4-5). That this might be represented in the Jewish Church also, it was enjoined upon the priests that they should not take widows, but virgins, for wives (Lev. 
21:13-15; Ezek. 44:22). [5] From the things contained in this verse it can be seen how pure is the Word in the internal sense, although it may not so appear in the letter; for when these words are read: 
"Behold I pray I have two daughters who have not known man; let me I pray bring them out unto you, and ye may do unto them as is good in your eyes, only unto these men do not anything," nothing but 
what is impure enters the ideas, especially the ideas of those who are in a life of evil. And yet how chaste these words are in the internal sense, is manifest from the explication, by which it is 
shown that they signify the affections of good and of truth, and the blessedness which they who do no violence to the Lord's Divine and Holy perceive from the enjoyment of them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2362</b></p><p><b>2362.</b>
That 'behold now, I have two daughters, who have not known a man' means the affections for good and for truth is clear from the meaning of 'daughters' as affections, dealt with in <a href="489.htm">489</a>-<a href="491.htm">491</a>. 'They have 
not known a man' means that they have not been defiled by falsity, for 'a man' means rational truth, and also in the contrary sense falsity, <a href="265.htm">265</a>, <a href="749.htm">749</a>, <a href="1007.htm">1007</a>. There are two types of affection, namely the 
affection for good and the affection for truth, see <a href="1997.htm">1997</a>. The first - the affection for good - constitutes the celestial church and in the Word is called 'the daughter of Zion' and also 'the virgin 
daughter of Zion'.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But the second - the affection for truth- constitutes the spiritual church, and in the Word is called 'the daughter of Jerusalem'; as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
She has despised you, she 
has scorned you, the virgin daughter of Zion; she wags her head behind you, the daughter of Jerusalem. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2037:22;%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 37:22; 2</a> 
</blockquote>
Kings 19:21. </p>
<p>In Jeremiah, </p>
<p>What shall I liken you to, O daughter of Jerusalem? 
What shall I equate you with and comfort you, O virgin daughter of Zion? Lam. 2:13. </p>
<p>In Micah, </p>
<p>You, O tower of the flock, hill of the daughter of Zion, to you will it come and the former dominion 
will come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem. Micah 4:8.  </p>
<p>In Zephaniah, </p>
<p>Shout with joy, O daughter of Zion! Make a noise, O Israel! Rejoice and exult with all your heart, O daughter of 
Jerusalem! Zeph. 3:14. </p>
<p>In Zechariah, </p>
<p>Exult greatly, O daughter of Zion! Make a noise, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king will come to you. Zech. 9:9; Matt. 21:5; John 12:15. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That 
the celestial Church, which is the Lord's celestial kingdom, is called 'the daughter of Zion' from the affection for good, that is, from love to the Lord Himself, see in addition Isa. 10:32; 16:1; 52:2; 62:11; Jer. 4:31; 6:2, <a href="23.htm">23</a>; Lam. 1: <a href="6.htm">6</a>; 2:1, <a href="4.htm">4</a>, <a href="8.htm">8</a>, <a href="10.htm">10</a>; Micah 4:10, <a href="13.htm">13</a>; Zech. 2:10; Ps. 9:14. And that the spiritual Church, which is the Lord's spiritual kingdom, is called 'the daughter of Jerusalem' 
from the affection for truth and so from charity towards the neighbour, see Lam. 2:15. Both of those Churches, and the nature of each one, have been dealt with many times in Volume One. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Because 
the celestial Church exists from love to the Lord which is present within love towards the neighbour it is likened in particular to an unmarried daughter or a virgin. Indeed it is also called 'a 
virgin', as in John, </p>
<p>These are the ones who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins; these are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes; for they are spotless before God's throne. Rev. 
14: <a href="4.htm">4</a>, <a href="5.htm">5</a>. </p>
<p>And so that the same might be represented in the Jewish Church, the priests were commanded not to marry widows but virgins, Lev. 21: <a href="13.htm">13</a>-<a href="15.htm">15</a>; Ezek. 44: <a href="22.htm">22</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 From the contents of the 
present verse it becomes clear how pure the Word is in the internal sense, however else it may appear in the letter. For when these words are read, 'Behold now, I have two daughters, who have not known 
a man; let me now bring them out to you and you may do to them as is good in your eyes; only do nothing to those men', nothing else comes to mind than something impure, especially to those leading 
an evil life. Yet how chaste these words are in the internal sense is evident from the explanation already given, which is that they mean the affections for good and truth and the blessedness perceived 
from the enjoyment of those affections by people who do no violence to the Lord's Divinity and [proceeding] Holiness. </p>

`Ecce quaeso mihi duae filiae, quae non cognoverunt virum': quod significet affectiones boni et veri, constat (c)a significatione `filiarum' quod sint affectiones, de qua {1} n. 489-491; `quod non cognoverint 
virum' significat quod non falsum contaminaverit illas, `vir' enim significat rationale verum, tum quoque in opposito sensu falsum, n. 265, 749, 1007: sunt binae affectiones, nempe boni et 
veri, videatur n. 1997; illa seu affectio boni, constituit Ecclesiam caelestem, et vocatur in Verbo `filia Zionis,' ut et `filia virgo Zionis'; haec autem, seu affectio veri, constituit Ecclesiam spiritualem, 
et vocatur in Verbo `filia Hierosolymae'; [2] ut apud Esaiam, 	Sprevit te, subsannavit te filia virgo Zionis, post te caput movit filia Hierosolymae xxxvii 22; 2 Reg. xix 21: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam, 	Quid 
assimilabo tibi o filia Hierosolymae? quid aequabo tibi, et consolabor te, virgo filia Zionis?  Thren. ii 13: </p>
<p>apud Micham, 	Tu o turris gregis, clive filiae Zionis usque ad te veniet et veniet 
dominium prius, regnum filiae Hierosolymae, iv 8: </p>
<p>apud Zephaniam, 	Jubila filia Zionis, clangite Israel, laetare et exsulta in toto corde filia Hierosolymae, iii 14: </p>
<p>apud Zachariam. 	Exsulta valde 
filia Zionis, clange filia Hierosolymae, ecce rex tuus veniet tibi, ix (x)9; Matth. xxi 5; Joh. xii 15. [3] Quod Ecclesia caelestis, seu regnum caeleste Domini, ex affectione boni, hoc est, ex amore 
in Ipsum Dominum, dicatur `filia Zionis' videatur adhuc, Esai. x 32; xvi 1; lii 2; lxii 11; Jer. iv 31; vi 2, 23; Thren. i 6; ii 1, 4, 8, 10; Mich. iv 10, 13; Zach. ii 14; Ps. ix 15 [A.V. 14]; et 
quod Ecclesia spiritualis, seu regnum spirituale Domini, ex affectione veri, et sic ex charitate erga proximum, dicatur `filia Hierosolymae,' Thren. ii 15.  De utraque illa Ecclesia; qualis una et qualis 
altera: pluries in Parte Prima actum est.  [4] Ecclesia caelestis ex eo quod ex amore in Dominum sit in amore erga proximum, assimilatur imprimis filiae innuptae seu virgini, immo etiam vocatur virgo, 
ut apud Johannem, 	Hi sunt qui cum mulieribus non polluti sunt, virgines enim sunt: hi sunt qui sequuntur Agnum, quo vadit,... immaculati enim sunt coram throno Dei, Apoc. xiv 4, 5; </p>
<p>ut quoque repraesentaretur 
hoc in Ecclesia Judaica, injunctum fuit sacerdotibus, ut `non viduas, sed virgines in uxores acciperent,' Lev. xxi 13-15; Ezech. xliv 22.  [5] Ex his quae in hoc versu sunt, constare potest 
quam purum sit Verbum in sensu interno, tametsi aliter in littera apparet; dum enim haec leguntur, `Ecce quaeso mihi duae filiae, quae non cognoverunt virum, educam quaeso eas ad vos, e faciatis 
eis sicut bonum in oculis vestris, tantum viris illis ne faciatis quicquam,' non aliud quam quoddam impurum subit ideas, imprimis in illorum qui in vita mali sunt; sed usque quam casta haec sint in sensu 
interno, patet ab explicatione, nempe quod significent affectione: boni (c)et veri, (c)ac beatitudinem quam perciperent ex fruitione earum illi qui Divinum et Sanctum Domini non violant. 	@1 prius.$ </p>
