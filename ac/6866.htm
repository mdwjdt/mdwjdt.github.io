<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6866节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6866.</strong>“摩西对神说”表从神性和谦卑所领受的觉知。这从“说”的含义和“摩西”的代表清楚可知：“说”是指觉知，如前面频繁所述；“摩西”是指神之律法方面的主（参看<a href="6723.htm">6723</a>，<a href="6752.htm">6752</a>，<a href="6771.htm">6771</a>，<a href="6827.htm">6827</a>节），“神”表示神性。这些话还暗示一种谦卑的状态，这一点从接下来的经文明显看出来，因为摩西说：“我是谁，竟能到法老那里，将以色列人领出来呢？”由于“摩西”代表主，并且此处提及谦卑，故有必要说一说主在世时的谦卑状态。主在尚未变成神性的人身里面到何等程度，就在何等程度上处于谦卑的状态；相反，他在已变成神性的人身里面到何等程度，就在何等程度上无法处于谦卑的状态，因为祂在同等程度上成为神和耶和华。祂在尚未变成神性的人身里面时之所以处于谦卑的状态，是因为祂从母亲所取的人身因着遗传而为邪恶，这人身若不处于谦卑的状态，就无法接近神性。因为人在真正谦卑的状态下会放弃凭自己思考凭自己思考或做任何事的一切能力，把自己完全交给神性，在这种情况下接近神性。诚然，神性在主里面，因为祂从耶和华成孕；但祂的人身越是处在从母亲遗传来的东西中，这神性就似乎越遥远。因为在属灵和属天的事物上，正是状态的相异性造成了这种遥远和不同在；而正是状态的相似性造成了接近和同在；正是爱造成了相似性和相异性。这一切表明主在世时存在于祂身上的谦卑状态从何而来；但后来，当祂脱去从母亲所取的人身，并且脱得如此彻底，以致祂不再是她的儿子，并披上神性时，谦卑的状态就结束了，因为那时，祂与耶和华为一。</p>

And Moses said unto God. That this signifies perception from the Divine and humiliation, is evident from the signification of "saying," as being perception (of which frequently above); and from the representation 
of Moses, as being the Lord as to the law Divine (see n. 6723, 6752, 6771, 6827). The Divine is signified by "God." That these words also involve humiliation is plain from what follows, 
for Moses says, "Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and bring forth the sons of Israel?" As by Moses is represented the Lord, and mention is here made of humiliation, something must be said about the 
state of the Lord's humiliation when He was in the world. So far as the Lord was in the human not yet made Divine, so far He was in humiliation; but so far as He was in the Human made Divine, so far 
He could not be in humiliation, for so far He was God and Jehovah. The reason why He was in humiliation when in the human not yet made Divine, was that the human which He took from the mother was by 
heredity evil, and this could not come near to the Divine without humiliation; for in genuine humiliation a man divests himself of all ability to think and do anything from himself, and wholly leaves 
himself to the Divine, and thus draws near to the Divine. The Divine was indeed in the Lord, because He was conceived of Jehovah, but this appeared remote insofar as His human was in the heredity from 
the mother; for in spiritual and heavenly things it is unlikeness of state that causes removal and absence, and it is likeness of state that causes approach and presence; and it is love that makes likeness 
and unlikeness. All this shows whence came the state of humiliation with the Lord when He was in the world; but afterward, when He put off all the human which He took from the mother, insomuch 
that He was no longer her son, and put on the Divine, then the state of humiliation ceased, for then He was one with Jehovah. </p>

'And Moses said to God' means perception received from the Divine, and a state of humility. This is clear from the meaning of 'saying' as perception, dealt with often; from the representation of 'Moses' 
as the Lord in respect of the law of God, dealt with in <a href="6723.htm">6723</a>, <a href="6752.htm">6752</a>, <a href="6771.htm">6771</a>, <a href="6827.htm">6827</a>, the Divine being meant by 'God'. These words also imply a state of humility, as is evident from what follows, for he 
says, 'Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should lead the children of Israel out?' Since 'Moses' represents the Lord and mention is made here of humility, something must be said about the 
Lord's state of humility when He was in the world. To the extent that the Human which had not yet been made Divine came to the forefront in the Lord He was in a state of humility; but to the extent 
that His Human which had been made Divine came to the forefront He could not be in a state of humility, for to that extent He was God and was Jehovah. The reason why He was in a state of humility when 
the Human which had not yet been made Divine came to the forefront was that the human which He derived from His mother was evil by heredity, and this could not draw near the Divine except in a state 
of humility. For when real humility is present in a person he surrenders all power to think or do anything by himself and abandons himself completely to the Divine, and in this condition draws near to 
the Divine. The Divine was, it is true, within the Lord, since He had been conceived from Jehovah; but the more the inheritance from His mother came to the forefront in His Human the more remote the 
Divine seemed to be. For in spiritual and celestial things dissimilarity of state is what lies behind remoteness and absence, while similarity of state is what lies behind nearness and presence; and 
what lies behind similarity and dissimilarity is love. From this one may now recognize the source of the state of humility that existed with the Lord when He was in the world. but later on, when He had 
cast off all the human derived from His mother, so completely that He was no longer her son, and had clothed Himself with the Divine, the state of humility came to an end; for then He was one with Jehovah. </p>

`Et dixit Moscheh ad Deum': quod significet perceptionem a Divino, et humiliationem, constat ex significatione `dicere' quod sit perceptio, de qua saepius; ex repraesentatione `Moschis' quod sit Dominus 
quoad legem Divinam, de qua n. 6723, 6752, 6771, 6827; Divinum significatur per `Deum'; quod illa verba etiam (x)involvant humiliationem, patet ab illis quae sequuntur, nam dicit, `Quis ego quod 
eam ad Pharaonem, et educam filios Israelis?' Quia per `Moschen' repraesentatur Dominus, et hic memoratur humiliatio, aliquid de statu humiliationis Domini cum in mundo fuit, dicendum est: quantum Dominus 
in Humano nondum Divino facto fuit, tantum in humiliatione fuit; sed quantum in Humano Divino facto, tantum non potuit esse in humiliatione, nam tantum Deus erat et Jehovah; quod in humiliatione 
fuerit cum in humano nondum Divino facto, erat quia humanum quod a matre traxit ex hereditario malum fuit, et hoc non potuit approximare ad Divinum absque humiliatione; nam homo in humiliatione genuina 
exuit se omni potentia ex se aliquid cogitandi et faciendi, et se prorsus Divino relinquit, ac ita ad Divinum accedit; Divinum quidem fuit in Ipso quia conceptus a Jehovah, sed hoc tantum apparuit remotum 
quantum Humanum Ipsius in hereditario materno fuit; in spiritualibus {1}enim et caelestibus est status dissimilitudo quae facit remotionem et absentiam, et est status similitudo quae facit appropinquationem 
et praesentiam; ac similitudinem et dissimilitudinem facit amor.  Ex his nunc constare potest unde status humiliationis apud Dominum cum fuit in mundo; postea autem, cum exuit omne humanum 
quod a matre traxit, usque adeo ut (t)non amplius ejus filius esset, et induit Divinum, tunc status humiliationis cessavit, nam tunc fuit unum cum Jehovah. 	@1 After caelestibus$ </p>
