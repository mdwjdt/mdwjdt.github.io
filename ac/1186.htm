<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1186节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1186.</strong>“亚述”是指推理。这从圣言中亚述的含义清楚可知，它经常用来表示那些属于理性的事物，具有双重含义，即表示理性事物和理论（reasonings）。严格来说，理智和理性之物用来表真实的事物，而推理（reasoning）和理论（reasonings）用来表虚假的事物。由于“亚述”表理性和推理，故它常与“埃及”连起来用，“埃及”表知识，因为理性和推理就基于这些知识。“亚述”表推理，这一点明显可见于以赛亚书：<br />有祸呀，亚述，我怒气的棍子，他不思想公义，他心也不这样打算，因为他说，我所成就的事，是靠我手的能力和我的智慧，我本有聪明。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.5.htm">10:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.13.htm">13</a>）<br />此处“亚述”表推理，因此经上指着他说“他不思想公义，他心也不这样打算”，还说他“靠自己的智慧行事，因为他本有聪明。”<br />以西结书：<br />有两个女子，同是一母的女儿，在埃及行邪淫；她们在幼年时行邪淫。阿荷拉行邪淫，贪恋所爱的人，就是她的邻邦亚述人，这些人都穿蓝衣，作首领和官长，都骑着马，是可爱的少年人。巴比伦人来到她那里，与她行淫玷污她。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.2.htm">23:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.5.htm">5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.6.htm">6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.17.htm">17</a>）<br />此处“埃及”表知识，“亚述”表推理，“巴比伦”表源于恶欲的虚假。<br />同一先知书：<br />耶路撒冷啊，你也和埃及人行淫，又与亚述人行淫，多行淫乱直到那迦南陆地，就是迦勒底。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.26.htm">16:26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.28.htm">28</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.29.htm">29</a>）<br />此处“埃及”同样表知识，“亚述”表推理。无论此处还是别处，基于知识推理属灵和属天的事物都被称为“行淫”。谁都能看出，这不是指与埃及人和亚述人行淫。<br />耶利米书：<br />以色列，现今你为何在埃及路上要喝西曷的水呢？你为何在亚述路上要喝大河（幼发拉底河）的水呢？（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.18.htm">2:18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.36.htm">36</a>）<br />此处“埃及”同样表知识，“亚述”表推理。<br />以色列是打散的羊，是被狮子赶出的。首先是亚述王将他吞灭，末后是巴比伦王将他的骨头折断。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.17.htm">50:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.18.htm">18</a>）<br />“亚述”表对属灵事物的推理。<br />弥迦书：<br />这位必作平安，当亚述进入我们的陆地，践踏我们宫殿的时候，我们就立起七个牧者、八个首领攻击他，他们必用刀剑征服亚述地和宁录地的关口；亚述人进入我们的陆地践踏的时候，他必拯救我们。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥5.5.htm">5:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥5.6.htm">6</a>）<br />这论及以色列，或属灵教会，关于它，经上说“亚述必不进入”，即推理必不进入。“宁录地”表宁录所表示的这类敬拜，它里面有内在的恶和假。<br />在圣言中，“亚述”还表教会成员所具有的理性，他凭这理性清楚明白何为真、何为善。这一事实清楚可见于何西阿书：<br />他们必如雀鸟从埃及急速而来，又如鸽子从亚述地来到。 （何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何11.11.htm">11:11</a>）<br />此处“埃及”表教会成员所具有的知识，“亚述”表他的理性。前面说过，“雀鸟”表所知道和理解的记忆知识（或科学知识），“鸽子”表理性的良善。<br />以赛亚书：<br />当那日，必有从埃及通亚述去的大道，亚述人要进入埃及，埃及人也进入亚述，埃及人必服侍亚述人。当那日，以色列必与埃及、亚述三国一律，使地上的人得福，因为万军之耶和华赐福给说，埃及我的百姓，亚述我手的工作，以色列我的产业，都有福了。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.23.htm">19:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.25.htm">25</a>）<br />这论及以色列所表示的属灵教会，“亚述”是它的理性，“埃及”是它的知识。这三者一个接一个依次而来，构成属灵教会成员的知识力量。<br />别处所提及的亚述表要么真实要么虚假的理性（如以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛20.1.htm">20:1</a>至末尾；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.13.htm">23:13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛27.13.htm">27:13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.31.htm">30:31</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛31.8.htm">31:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛31.36.htm">36</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛31.37.htm">37</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛52.4.htm">52:4</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.23.htm">27:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.24.htm">24</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结31.3.htm">31:3</a>至末尾；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结32.22.htm">32:22</a>；弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥7.12.htm">7:12</a>；西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番2.13.htm">2:13</a>；撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚10.11.htm">10:11</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗83.8.htm">83:8</a>）。“亚述”表推理（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何5.13.htm">5:13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/何7.11.htm">7:11</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/何10.6.htm">10:6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/何11.5.htm">11:5</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/何12.1.htm">12:1</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/何14.3.htm">14:3</a>；撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚10.10.htm">10:10</a>），所论及的以法莲表心智的理性部分，但这里已败坏。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1186.</strong> The fact that Asshur is skewed reasoning can be seen from the symbolism of Asshur, or Assyria, in the Word, where it is always taken to mean matters of reason, in both senses — both rational thinking and rationalizations. (Reason and rational thinking, strictly speaking, mean valid mental processes, while rationalizing and rationalizations mean dishonest ones.) Because Asshur symbolizes both reason and rationalization, it is usually connected with Egypt, which symbolizes secular knowledge, since reason and rationalization are based on such knowledge.<br />Asshur's symbolism as rationalization can be seen in Isaiah:<br />Doom to Asshur, the rod of my anger! He thinks what is not right, and his heart contemplates what is not right. He has said, "In the strength of my hand have I done this, and in my wisdom, because I have understanding." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_10_5" target=_top>Isaiah 10:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_10_7" target=_top>7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_10_13" target=_top>13</a>)<br />Asshur stands for rationalization, which is why it is said of him that he thinks and contemplates what is not right and claims that he does so through his wisdom, because he has understanding.<br />[2] In Ezekiel:<br />Two women, the daughters of one mother, whored in Egypt. In their youthful years they whored. One whored and doted on her lovers — the neighboring Asshur [Assyrians],{*1} dressed in blue-violet; leaders and rulers; desirable young men, all of them; riders riding horses. To her came the sons of Babylon, and they defiled her through their whorings. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_23_2-3" target=_top>Ezekiel 23:2-3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_23_5-6" target=_top>5-6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_23_17" target=_top>17</a>)<br />Egypt in this passage stands for secular facts, Asshur for rationalization, and the sons of Babylon for false ideas that develop out of corrupt desires.<br />[3] In the same author:<br />Jerusalem, you whored with the sons of Egypt; you whored with the sons of Assyria. You multiplied your whoredom in the land of Canaan all the way to Chaldea. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_16_26" target=_top>Ezekiel 16:26</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_16_28-29" target=_top>28-29</a>)<br />Egypt again stands for secular facts and Assyria for rationalization. To engage in twisted reasoning about spiritual and heavenly concerns on the basis of facts is called whoredom, both here and elsewhere in the Word. Anyone can see that it does not refer to whoredom with Egyptians and Assyrians.<br />[4] In Jeremiah:<br />Israel, why should you go to Egypt to drink the waters of the Sihor, and why should you go to Assyria to drink the waters of the river [Euphrates]?{*2} (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_2_18" target=_top>Jeremiah 2:18</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_2_36" target=_top>36</a>)<br />Once again Egypt stands for facts and Assyria for flawed reasoning. In the same author:<br />A strayed sheep is Israel; lions drove him off. First to eat him was the king of Assyria, and this later one, the king of Babylon, took his bones. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_50_17-18" target=_top>Jeremiah 50:17-18</a>)<br />Assyria stands for flawed reasoning on spiritual subjects.<br />[5] In Micah:<br />This will be peace, when Assyria comes into our land and when he tramples our palaces. And we will set up over him seven shepherds and eight chiefs of the people, and they will graze on the land of Assyria with a sword and on the land of Nimrod in its gates. And one will deliver [us] from Assyria, when he comes into our land and when he tramples our border. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_micah_5_5-6" target=_top>Micah 5:5-6</a>)<br />This is about Israel (the spiritual church), which it says that Assyria (sophistic reasoning) would not invade.{*3} The land of Nimrod stands for the kind of worship that Nimrod symbolizes, which contains evil and falsity at a deep level.<br />[6] Assyria's other symbolism in the Word — as true reason in a member of the church, which allows the person to see truth and goodness clearly — appears in Hosea:<br />They will quake like a bird from Egypt and like a dove from the land of Assyria. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_hosea_11_11" target=_top>Hosea 11:11</a>)<br />In this passage, Egypt stands for factual learning and Assyria for reason in a person who is part of the church. A bird is factual knowledge that we really understand, while a pigeon, or dove, is goodness on a rational plane, as shown earlier [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_40" target=_top>40</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_745" target=_top>745</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_776" target=_top>776-777</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_870" target=_top>870</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_891" target=_top>891</a>].<br />[7] In Isaiah:<br />On that day there will be a path from Egypt to Assyria, and Assyria will come into Egypt and Egypt into Assyria, and the Egyptians will serve Assyria. On that day Israel will be third to Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the middle of the earth, whom Jehovah Sabaoth will bless, saying, "A blessing on my people Egypt and on the work of my hands, Assyria, and on my inheritance, Israel!" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_19_23-24" target=_top>Isaiah 19:23-24</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_19_25" target=_top>25</a>)<br />The subject here is the spiritual church, which is Israel. Rationality in this church is Assyria, and the secular knowledge in it is Egypt. These three make up the intellectual abilities of people in the spiritual church, and they come in that order.<br />Assyria, or Asshur, symbolizes either true or false rationality in other places where it comes up too, as for instance in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_20_1-6" target=_top>Isaiah 20:1-end</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_23_13" target=_top>23:13</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_27_13" target=_top>27:13</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_30_31" target=_top>30:31</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_31_8" target=_top>31:8</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_36_1-22" target=_top>36</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_37_1-38" target=_top>37</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_52_4" target=_top>52:4</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_27_23-24" target=_top>Ezekiel 27:23-24</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_31_3-18" target=_top>31:3-end</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_micah_7_12" target=_top>Micah 7:12</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_zephaniah_2_13" target=_top>Zephaniah 2:13</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_zechariah_10_11" target=_top>Zechariah 10:11</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_psalms_83_8" target=_top>Psalms 83:8</a>.

[LHC]<br />{*2} The interpolation in square brackets is Swedenborg's. [LHC]<br />{*3} Although the quotation actually says twice that Assyria would come into the land, the idea is that the invasion will be unsuccessful, as indicated in the assertion that an unnamed force "will deliver [Judah] from Assyria." The passage refers to the invasion of the kingdom of Judah by the Assyrian king Sennacherib in 701 b.c.e., described in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_2-kings_18-19_13-35" target=_top>2 Kings 18:13-19:35</a>.

[LHC, RS]<br />{*4} Ephraim, one of the sons of Joseph, was the eponymous father of the Israelite tribe of Ephraim (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_genesis_41_52" target=_top>Genesis 41:52</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_genesis_48_13" target=_top>48:13</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_genesis_48_17" target=_top>17</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_genesis_48_20" target=_top>20</a>). The Hebrew prophets often use the name as a synecdoche for the northern kingdom of the ten tribes of Israel that existed between the tenth and eighth centuries b.c.e. (see, for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_7_5" target=_top>Isaiah 7:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_7_8" target=_top>8</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_7_9" target=_top>9</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186/bible_king-james-version_hosea_6_10" target=_top>Hosea 6:10</a>) because Ephraim was the chief tribe of that region.

That "Asshur" is reasoning, is evident from the signification of Asshur or Assyria in the Word, where it is constantly taken for the things which pertain to reason, in both senses; namely, for what is 
of reason, and for reasonings. By reason and rational things are properly meant things that are true; and by reasoning and reasonings, those which are false. Because "Asshur" signifies reason and reasoning, 
it is very frequently connected with "Egypt," which signifies memory-knowledges; for reason and reasoning are from such knowledges. That "Asshur" signifies reasoning is evident in Isaiah: </p>
<p>  
   Woe unto Asshur, the rod of Mine anger, he thinketh not right, neither doth his heart meditate right, he hath said, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my Wisdom, because I am intelligent 
(Isa. 10:5, 7, 13), where "Asshur" denotes reasoning, of whom it is therefore predicated that he neither thinketh nor doth meditate right; and it is said, "by his own wisdom, because he is intelligent." 
 [2] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Two women, the daughters of one mother, committed whoredom in Egypt; they committed whoredom in their youth. The one committed whoredom, and doted on her lovers, on Asshur 
(the Assyrians) her neighbors, who were clothed in blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses. The sons of Babel came to her, and they defiled her with 
their whoredom (Ezek. 23:2-3, 5-6, 17). Here "Egypt" denotes memory-knowledges; "Asshur," reasoning; and "the sons of Babel," falsities from cupidities. [3] In the same: </p>
<p>     O Jerusalem, thou hast 
also committed whoredom with the sons of Egypt, thou hast committed whoredom also with the sons of Asshur, and thou hast multiplied thy whoredom even into the land of Canaan unto Chaldea (Ezek. 16:26, 
28-29), where "Egypt" in like manner denotes memory-knowledges; "Asshur," reasoning. Reasoning from memory-knowledges concerning spiritual and celestial things is called "whoredom," both here and 
elsewhere in the Word. That whoredom with the Egyptians and the Assyrians is not meant, anyone can see.  [4] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Israel, what hast thou to do with the way of Egypt, to drink the waters 
of Shihor? and what hast thou to do with the way of Asshur, to drink the waters of the river [Euphrates]? (Jer. 2:18, 36). Here likewise "Egypt" denotes memory-knowledges; and "Asshur," reasoning. In 
the same: </p>
<p>     Israel is a scattered sheep, the lions have driven him away, first the king of Asshur hath devoured him, and after that this king of Babel hath broken his bones (Jer. 50:17-18). "Asshur" 
here is reasoning concerning spiritual things.  [5] In Micah: </p>
<p>     This shall be the peace, when Asshur shall come into our land, and when he shall tread in our palaces, we will even set over 
him seven shepherds, and eight princes of men, and they shall feed down the land of Asshur with the sword, and the land of Nimrod, In the gates thereof, and he shall deliver from Asshur, when he shall 
come into our land, and when he shall tread upon our border (Micah 5:5-6). The subject here is Israel, or the spiritual church, of which it is said that "Asshur shall not enter in," that is, that reasoning 
shall not; "the land of Nimrod" denotes such worship as is signified by Nimrod, in which the interiors are evil and false.  [6] That "Asshur" in the Word is also reason, which is in the man of 
the church, whereby he discerns truth and good, is evident in Hosea: </p>
<p>     They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Asshur (Hos. 11:11). "Egypt" here denotes the 
memory-knowledge of the man of the church; and "Asshur," his reason. That a "bird" is the intellectual of the memory [scientificum intellectuale], and "a dove" rational good, has been shown before.  [7] 
In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     In that day shall there be a path from Egypt to Asshur, and Asshur shall come into Egypt, and Egypt into Asshur, and the Egyptians shall serve Asshur. In that day shall Israel be 
the third with Egypt and with Asshur, a blessing in the midst of the land, which Jehovah Zebaoth shall bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt My people, and Asshur the work of My hands, and Israel Mine inheritance 
(Isa. 19:23-25). The subject here is the spiritual church, which is "Israel," whose reason is "Asshur," and memory-knowledge "Egypt." These three constitute the intellectual things of the man 
of the spiritual church, which follow one another in this order. In other places also where Asshur is named, it signifies the rational, either true or false, as in Isaiah 20:1 to the end; 23:13; 27:13; 
30:31; 31:8, 36-37; 52:4; Ezek. 27:23-24; 31:3 to the end; 32:22; Micah 7:12; Zeph. 2:13; Zech. 10:11; Ps. 83:8. "Asshur" denotes reasoning in Hosea 5:13; 7:11; 10:6; 11:5; 12:1; 14:3; and in Zechariah 
10:10, where Ephraim is spoken of, by whom is signified the intellectual, but here, perverted. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1186</b></p><p><b>1186.</b>
That 'Asshur' is reasoning is clear from the meaning of 'Asshur' or Assyria in the Word, where in every case it stands for those things that belong to reason. It stands for them in both senses, namely 
for rational things and for reasonings - reason and rational things being used strictly speaking to mean things that are true, and reasoning and reasonings to mean those that are false. Because 'Asshur' 
means reason and reasoning it is very frequently linked with Egypt, which means facts, for reason and reasoning are based on facts. That Asshur means reasoning is clear in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Woe to Asshur, 
the rod of My anger, he does not think what is right and his heart does not consider what is right He has said, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom, for I have intelligence 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2010:5,%207,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 10:5, 7, 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'Asshur' stands for reasoning, and therefore he is referred to as 'not thinking and not considering what is right', and it is said that 'he acts by his own wisdom, for he has 
intelligence'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Two women, the daughters of one mother, committed whoredom in Egypt. In their youth they committed whoredom. One committed whoredom and doted on her lovers, on Asshur 
(the Assyrians), her neighbours, clothed in violet, leaders and governors, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses The sons of Babel came to her and they defiled her with their 
whoredom. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2023:2,%203,%205,%206,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 23:2, 3, 5, 6, 17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'Egypt' stands for facts, 'Asshur' for reasoning, 'the sons of Babel' for falsities springing from evil desires. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Jerusalem, you 
committed whoredom with the sons of Egypt, you committed whoredom with the sons of Asshur, you multiplied your whoredom even into the land of Canaan towards Chaldaea. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2016:26,%2028,%2029&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 16:26, 28, 29</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here likewise 
'Egypt' stands for facts, 'Asshur' for reasoning. Reasoning, based on facts, concerning spiritual and celestial things is called 'whoredom' both here and elsewhere in the Word. Anyone may see 
that committing whoredom with Egyptians and with Assyrians is not the meaning. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Israel, what have you to do with the way to Egypt, to drink the waters of Shihor? And what have you 
to do with the way to Asshur, to drink the waters of the River (the Euphrates)? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%202:18,%2036&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 2:18, 36</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here likewise 'Egypt' stands for facts, 'Asshur' for reasoning. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Israel is a 
scattered flock; the lions have driven him away. First the king of Asshur has devoured him, and last this king of Babel has removed his bones. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2050:17,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 50:17, 18</a> 
</blockquote>
<p>'Asshur' stands for reasoning concerning 
spiritual things.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Micah, </p>
<blockquote>
And this will be peace, when Asshur comes into our land and when he treads our palaces, and we will set up over him seven shepherds and eight princes of men and 
they will rule the land of Asshur with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in its gates; and he will deliver [us] from Asshur when he comes into our land and when he treads our border. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Micah%205:5,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Micah 5:5, 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This 
refers to Israel, or the spiritual Church, concerning which it is said that 'Asshur will not enter in', that is, reasoning will not do so. 'The land of Nimrod' stands for the kind of worship meant 
by Nimrod, which has interior evils and falsities within it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 The fact that in the Word 'Asshur' also means reason present with the member of the Church, by means of which reason he sees clearly 
what is true and what is good, is clear in Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
They will tremble like a bird out of Egypt, and like a dove from the land of Asshur. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%2011:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 11:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'Egypt' stands for the knowledge a member 
of the Church possesses, 'Asshur' for his reason. That 'a bird' means facts that are known and understood, and 'a dove' rational good, has been shown already. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
On that day there 
will be a highway from Egypt to Asshur, and Asshur will come into Egypt and Egypt into Asshur, and the Egyptians will serve Asshur.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> On that day Israel will be the third with Egypt and Asshur, a blessing 
in the midst of the earth, whom Jehovah Zebaoth will bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt My people, and Asshur the work of My hands, and Israel My heritage. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2019:23-25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 19:23-25</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the spiritual 
Church, meant by Israel, 'Asshur' being its reason, and 'Egypt' its knowledge. These three constitute the intellectual powers of the member of the spiritual Church which come in that order one 
after another. In other places where Asshur is mentioned it means the rational, true or false, as in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isaiah%2020:1-end;%2023:13;%2027:13;%2030:30;%2031:8;%2036&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isaiah 20:1-end; 23:13; 27:13; 30:30; 31:8; 36</a> and <a href="37.htm">37</a>; 52:4; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2027:23,%2024;%2031:3-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 27:23, 24; 31:3-end</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Micah%207:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Micah 7:12</a>;

</p><b>1186.</b>
Quod 'Asshur' sit ratiocinatio, constat a significatione 'Asshuris' seu Assyriae in Verbo, ubi jugiter accipitur pro illis quae rationis sunt, in utroque sensu, nempe pro rationalibus et pro ratiocinationibus 
(per rationem et rationalia intelliguntur proprie illa quae vera sunt, per ratiocinationem autem et ratiocinia ea quae falsa); 'Asshur' quia significat rationem et ratiocinationem, plerumque 
adjungitur 'Aegypto' quae significat scientifica, quia ratio et ratiocinatio est ex scientificis.  Quod Asshur ratiocinationem significet, constat apud Esaiam, Vae Asshur, virga irae Meae, ...ille 
non rectum cogitat, et cor ejus non rectum meditatur, ...dixit, In virtute manus meae feci, et in sapientia mea, quia intelligens sum, x 5, 7, 13; </p>
<p>ubi 'Asshur' pro ratiocinatione, de quo ideo praedicatur 
quod 'non rectum cogitet et meditetur,' et dicitur quod 'per sapientiam suam, quia intelligens':  [2] apud Ezechielem, Duae mulieres, filiae unius matris, scortatae sunt in Aegypto; in adolescentiis 
suis scortatae sunt, ...scortata est una, et dilexit amasios suos, Asshurem (Assyrios) propinquos, vestitos hyacinthino, duces et praefectos, juvenes desiderii omnes eos, equites equitantes equis; 
...venerunt ad eam filii Babelis, ...et polluerunt eam per scortationem suam, xxiii 2, 3, 5, 6, 17; </p>
<p>ubi 'Aegyptus' pro scientificis, 'Asshur' pro ratiocinatione, 'filii Babelis' pro falsis ex cupiditatibus: 
 [3] apud eundem, Hierosolyma scortata es cum filiis Aegypti, ...scortata es cum filiis Asshuris; ...multiplicasti scortationem usque in (x)terram Canaan ad Chaldaeam, xvi 26, 28, 29; </p>
<p>'Aegyptus' 
similiter pro scientificis; 'Asshur' pro ratiocinatione; ratiocinatio ex scientificis de spiritualibus et caelestibus vocatur 'scortatio,' et hic et alibi in Verbo; quod non scortatio sit cum 
Aegyptiis et cum Assyriis, quisque videre potest:  [4]apud Jeremiam, Israel, quid tibi cum via Aegypti, ad bibendum aquas Shihoris?  et quid tibi cum via Asshuris, ad bibendum aquas fluvii (Euphratis)? 
 ii 18, 36; </p>
<p>similiter 'Aegyptus' pro scientificis, et 'Asshur' pro ratiocinatione:   apud eundem, Pecus dispersa Israel, leones dispulerunt, prior comedit eum rex Asshuris, et hic posterior deossavit 
eum rex Babelis, l 17, 18; </p>
<p>'Asshur' pro ratiocinatione de spiritualibus:  [5] apud Micham,  Erit haec pax, Asshur cum venerit in terram nostram, et cum calcaverit palatia nostra, et constituemus 
super eum septem  pastores, et octo principes hominum, et depascent terram Asshuris gladio, et terram Nimrodi in portis ejus, et liberabit ab Asshure, cum venerit in terram nostram, et cum calcaverit 
terminum nostrum, v 4, 5 [A.V. 5, 6]; </p>
<p>ibi de Israele seu Ecclesia spirituali, de qua dicitur quod 'Asshur non intrabit,' hoc est, quod non ratiocinatio; 'terra Nimrodi' pro tali cultu qui significatus 
est per Nimrodum in quo mala et falsa interiora.  [6] Quod etiam Asshur in Verbo sit ratio quae apud hominem Ecclesiae, per quam perspicit verum et bonum, constat apud Hosheam, Pavebunt sicut avis 
ex Aegypto, et sicut columba e terra Asshuris, xi 11; </p>
<p>ubi 'Aegyptus' pro scientia hominis Ecclesiae, et 'Asshur' pro ratione ejusdem; quod 'avis' sit scientificum intellectuale, et 'columba' rationale 
bonum, prius ostensum est:  [7] apud Esaiam, In die illo erit semita ab Aegypto ad Asshur, et veniet Asshur in Aegyptum, et Aegyptus in Asshurem, et servient Aegyptii Asshuri.  In die illo erit Israel 
tertius Aegypto et Asshuri, benedictio in medio terrae, cui benedicet Jehovah Zebaoth, dicendo, Benedictus populus Meus Aegyptus, et opus manuum Mearum Asshur, et hereditas Mea Israel, xix 23-25; </p>
<p>ubi 
de Ecclesia spirituali quae est 'Israel,' cujus ratio 'Asshur,' et scientia 'Aegyptus'; haec tria constituunt hominis Ecclesiae spiritualis intellectualia, quae ita succedunt.  Alibi quoque 'Asshur,' 
ubi nominatur, significat rationale verum aut falsum, ut apud Esaiam xx 1 ad fin.; xxiii 13; xxvii 13; xxx 31; xxxi 8; (x)xxxvi et xxxvii; lii 4; Ezech. xxvii 23, 24; xxxi 3 ad fin.; Mich. vii 
12; Zeph. ii 13; Zach. x 11; Ps. lxxxiii 9 [A.V. 8]; 'Asshur' pro ratiocinatione, apud Hos. v 13; vii 11; x 6; xi 5; xii 2 [A.V. 1]; xiv 4 [A.V. 3], et apud Zach. x 10, ubi praedicatur de Ephraimo per 
quem significatur intellectuale, sed ibi perversum. </p>
