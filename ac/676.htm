"And take for yourself some food of every type that is eaten and gather it to yourself, and it will serve you and them as food."<br />He was to take for himself some food of every type that was eaten symbolizes what is pleasurable and good. He was to gather it to himself symbolizes what is true. It was to serve him and them as food symbolizes both. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 676</b></p><p><b>676.</b>
Verse 21. And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and gather it to thee; and it shall be for food, for thee and for them. That he should "take to himself of all food that is eaten" signifies 
goods and delights; that he should "gather to himself" signifies truths; that it should be "for food for him and for them" signifies both. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 676</b></p><p><b>676.</b>
Verse 21 And take for yourself of all food that is eaten, and gather it to yourself, and it will be food for you and them.  </p>
<p>'He was to take for himself of all food that is eaten' means goods and delights. 
'He was to gather them to himself' means truths. 'It was to be food for him and them' means both of these things. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 676</b>
</p><b>676.</b>
Vers. 21.  Et tu sume tibi ab omni cibo, qui comeditur; et collige ad te, et erit tibi et illis in cibum. 'Quod sumeret sibi ab omni cibo, qui comeditur' significat bona et jucunda: 'quod colligeret 
ad se' significat vera: quod 'esset ei et illis in cibum' significat utrumque. </p>
