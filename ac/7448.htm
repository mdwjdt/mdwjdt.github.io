<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7448节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7448.</strong>“大群讨厌的苍蝇进入法老的宫殿和他臣仆的房屋，进入埃及全地”表恶毒的虚假从他们当中的四面八方爆发出来。这从“讨厌的苍蝇”和“法老的宫殿和他臣仆的房屋，全地”的含义清楚可知：“讨厌的苍蝇”是拽恶毒的虚假，如前所述（<a href="7441.htm">7441</a>节）；“法老的宫殿和他臣仆的房屋，全地”是指属世层中的每一个事物（参看<a href="7396.htm">7396</a>，<a href="7441.htm">7441</a>，<a href="7442.htm">7442</a>节），在此从每一个事物，或从四面八方，因为所表示的是这些虚假的爆发。“讨厌的苍蝇进入房屋”最接近的意义是，虚假进入邪恶所在的地方，并与邪恶结合。但虚假与邪恶结合时，邪恶就通过虚假爆发出来。正因如此，“讨厌的苍蝇进入法老的宫殿和他臣仆的房屋，进入埃及全地”表示恶毒的虚假爆发出来，事实上从四面八方爆发出来。</p>

And there came the grievous noisome fly into the house of Pharaoh, and into the house of his servants, and into all the land of Egypt. That this signifies that malevolent falsities burst forth from all 
sides among them, is evident from the signification of "the noisome fly," as being the falsities of malevolence (of which above, n. 7441); and from the signification of "the house of Pharaoh, and the 
house of his servants, and all the land," as being all things and each in the natural (see n. 7396, 7441, 7442), here from all things and each, or from all sides, because it is signified that these 
falsities burst forth. By "the noisome fly coming into the house" is proximately signified that falsities entered where evils were, and that they conjoined themselves with evils; but when falsities have 
been conjoined with evils, then evils burst forth by means of falsities. From this it is that by "the noisome fly came into the house of Pharaoh, and into the house of his servants, and into all the 
land of Egypt," there is signified that malevolent falsities burst forth, and indeed from all sides. </p>

'And extremely noxious flying insects came to the house of Pharaoh, and to the houses of his servants, and into all the land of Egypt' means that malevolent falsities burst out from every side among 
them. This is clear from the meaning of 'noxious flying insects' as malevolent falsities, dealt with above in <a href="7441.htm">7441</a>; and from the meaning of 'the house of Pharaoh, the houses of his servants, and all the 
land' as every single thing in the natural, dealt with in <a href="7396.htm">7396</a>, <a href="7441.htm">7441</a>, <a href="7442.htm">7442</a>, at this point from every single one or from every side, since the bursting out of those falsities is meant. The proximate 
meaning of the coming of the noxious flying insects to the house is that falsities entered where evils were present and joined themselves to the evils. But when falsities have been joined to evils the 
evils burst out by means of the falsities. So it is that 'the noxious flying insects came to the house of Pharaoh, and to the houses of his servants, and into all the land of Egypt' means that malevolent 
falsities burst out, and indeed from every side. </p>

</p><b>7448.</b>
`Et venit volatile noxium grave domum Pharaonis, et domum servorum illius, et in omnem terram Aegypti': quod significet quod falsa malevola ex undique apud illos erumperent, constat ex significatione 
`volatilis noxii' quod sint falsa malevolentiae, de qua supra n. 7441; et ex significatione `domus Pharaonis, domus servorum ejus, et omnis terrae' quod sint omnia et singula in naturali, de qua n. 
7396, 7441, 7442, hic ex omnibus et singulis, seu ex undique, quia significatur quod falsa illa erumperent.  {1} Quod `volatile noxium' veniret domum, significatur proxime quod falsa intrarent ubi mala, 
et quod cum malis se conjungerent; sed quando falsa conjuncta sunt cum malis, tunc mala erumpunt per falsa; inde est quod per `venit volatile noxium domum Pharaonis, et domum servorum illius, et in 
omnem terram Aegypti' significetur quod falsa malevola erumperent, et quidem ab undique. 	@1 i Per$ </p>
