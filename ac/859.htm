<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第859节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>859.</strong>“到了十月初一，山顶都露出来了”表这时开始变得可见的信之真理。这一点从表示源于爱与仁的良善（<a href="795.htm">795</a>节）的山之含义清楚可知。当一个人正在重生，并被赋予良知，通过良知被赋予仁爱之时，这些山顶就开始被看见。人若以为他从其它有利位置，而非从源于爱与仁的良善看到了山顶，也就是信之真理，那他就大错特错了。因为没有这些，犹太人和未教化的外邦人同样能看到它们。“山顶”是显现的第一缕光芒。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]859.</strong> The symbolism of on the first of the month the heads of the mountains appeared as religious truth that then began to be visible is established by the symbolism of mountains as the good effects of love and charity (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_859/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_795" target=_top>795</a>). The heads start to show when we are being reborn and given a conscience and, through conscience, charity.<br />Those who think they see mountaintops, or religious truth, from any other perspective than that of a loving, charitable goodness are completely mistaken. Otherwise, Jews and blasphemous Gentiles{*1} would also be able to see the truth, even though they lack such goodness.<br />The mountaintops are the first points of light to appear.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On Swedenborg's attitude toward Jews, see note 4 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_859/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_259" target=_top>259</a> and the reader's guide, pages 51-55. On the term "Gentiles," see note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_859/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_231" target=_top>231</a>. [JSR] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 859</b></p><p><b>859.</b>
That "on the first day of the month the tops of the mountains appeared" signifies the truths of faith which then begin to be seen, is evident from the signification of "mountains" (n. 795), as being 
the goods of love and of charity. Their tops begin to be seen when man is being regenerated, and is being gifted with conscience, and thereby with charity; and he who supposes that he sees the tops of 
the mountains, or the truths of faith, from any other ground than from the goods of love and of charity, is quite mistaken; since without these, Jews and profane Gentiles may see them in the same way. 
The "tops of the mountains" are the first dawnings of light which appear. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 859</b></p><p><b>859.</b>
'On the first of the month the tops of the mountains appeared' means the truths of faith which at that point start to become visible. This is clear from the meaning of 'mountains' as goods that stem 
from love and charity, <a href="795.htm">795</a>. These mountain-tops start to be seen when a person is being regenerated and is being given a conscience, and through conscience charity. Anyone is utterly mistaken who supposes 
that he sees the tops of the mountains, which are the truths of faith, from any other vantage point than the goods that stem from love and charity. Without these, Jews and untaught gentiles can see 
just the same. 'The tops of the mountains' are the first rays of light to appear. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 859</b>
</p><b>859.</b>
Quod 'in primo mensis apparuerint capita montium' significent vera fidei quae tunc videri incipiunt, constat a significatione 'montium,' n. 795, quod sint bona amoris et charitatis; haec capita tunc 
videri incipiunt, cum homo regeneratur, et donatur conscientia et per illam charitate: qui putat se videre 'capita montium,' seu vera fidei aliunde quam ex bonis amoris et charitatis, prorsus fallitur; 
absque illis Judaei et profani gentiles possunt similiter videre. 'Capita montium' sunt prima lucis quae apparent. </p>
