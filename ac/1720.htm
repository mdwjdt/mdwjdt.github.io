And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after he returned (from striking Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him) to the valley of Shaveh, that is, the king's valley.<br />The king of Sodom went out to meet him means that evil and falsity surrendered. After he returned from striking Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him symbolizes the deliverance and rescue of apparent goodness and truth. To the valley of Shaveh, that is, the king's valley, symbolizes the state at that point of the goodness and truth in the outer self. </p>

Verse 17. And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from smiting Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, this is the king's valley. "The king of Sodom 
went out to meet him," signifies that the evil and falsity submitted themselves; "after his return from smiting Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him," signifies the liberation and vindication 
of the apparent goods and truths; "at the valley of Shaveh, this is the king's valley," signifies the state of the external man as to goods and truths at that time. </p>

Verse 17 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after he had returned from smiting Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's valley. </p>
<p>'The king 
of Sodom went out to meet him' means that the evil and falsity submitted to Him. 'After he had returned from smiting Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him' means the release and reclamation of 
the apparent goods and truths. 'At the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's valley' means the state of the External Man as regards goods and truths at that time. </p>

</p><b>1720.</b>
Vers. 17.  Et exivit rex Sodomae obviam illi, postquam reversus est ille a percutiendo Kedorlaomerum, et reges qui cum illo, ad vallem Shaveh, haec vallis regis. 'Exivit rex Sodomae obviam illi' significat 
malum et falsum quod se submiserit: 'postquam reversus est ille a percutiendo Kedorlaomerum et reges qui cum illo' significat liberationem et vindicationem bonorum et verorum apparentium: 'ad 
vallem Shaveh, haec vallis regis' significat statum Externi Hominis quoad bona et vera tunc. </p>
