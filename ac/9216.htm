<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9216节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9216.</strong>“使他可以在里头睡觉”表停靠在它们上面。这从“睡觉”的含义清楚可知。“睡觉”是指休息，在此是指停靠在“衣服”所表示的外在感官层上（参看<a href="9212.htm">9212</a>节）；因为经上说“他可以在衣服里头睡觉”。有必要说明当如何理解这一解释，即：内层事物停靠在感官层上。感官层是人生命的最末和最低层，如前所示。这最低层包含一切内层事物，是它们所共有的，因为它们终止于它，并相应地停靠在它上面。例如，这就像皮肤，皮肤是身体最外在的覆盖物。身体和身体里的一切事物都终止于皮肤，因为皮肤包含它们，它们相应地停靠在皮肤上。这同样像体内的腹膜；由于它包含腹部器官，所以这些器官停靠在它上面，还与它有全方位的联系。它又像胸膜与胸部器官的关系。<br />构成人的真正生命的一切事物都存在这种情感。如与人的理解力有关的事物，以及与他的意愿有关的事物。这些也按照从内层事物到外层事物的次序而彼此跟随。外层事物是记忆知识及其快乐，而最外层的事物是感官事物，这些事物通过视觉、听觉、味觉、嗅觉、触觉与世界相联。内层事物就停靠在它们上面，因为内层事物终止于它们。这些就是“遮盖物”，或“他可以在里头睡觉的衣服”在灵义上所表示的事物。感官事物由“衣服”或“遮盖物”来表示的原因在于对应关系；因为如前所述（<a href="9212.htm">9212</a>节），灵人和天使照着他们的信之真理而身穿衣服；那些处于源于良善的真理之人穿着放光的衣服，如在主坟墓旁的天使（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.4.htm">24:4</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.3.htm">28:3</a>）；有的穿着白色细麻衣，如启示录（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.14.htm">19:14</a>）提到的天使；有的穿着各种颜色的衣服。<br />此外，要知道，一切事物，无一例外，都按照连续阶段从它们的最初或至内层行进到它们的最末和最低层，并停靠在它们上面。每一个在先或内层事物都依次与最低层的终止之物有自己的联系。因此，如果最低层的事物被驱散，那么内层事物也会被驱散。这也解释了为何天堂有三层；至内层或第三层天堂流入中间或第二层天堂；中间或第二层天堂流入第一或最低层天堂，该层天堂又流入人类并与人同住。所以，人类构成秩序的最低层；天堂便终止于人类，并停靠在它上面。正因如此，主出于其神性的爱和关怀，始终规定人类当中应有一个教会，神所揭示的真理存在于这教会中，在我们地球，这真理就是圣言。人类与天堂通过圣言有一个持续的联结。这就是为何圣言的每一个细节都有一个为天堂而存在的内义在里面，这内义具有这样的性质：它用一根纽带将天使的心智与人类的心智如此紧密地结合在一起，以致他们行如一体。这一切又一次清楚表明内层事物停靠在最低层的事物上是怎么回事。</p>

Wherein he may sleep. That this signifies rest upon them, is evident from the signification of "sleeping," as being to rest, here upon the external sensuous which is signified by the "garment" (see n. 
9212); for it is said, "the garment wherein he may sleep." How it is to be understood that interior things have rest upon the sensuous, shall be told. The sensuous is the ultimate of man's life, as 
was shown above. This contains all the interior things, and is common to them, for they terminate in it, and thus rest upon it; as for example the skin, which is the ultimate covering of the body; for 
in this the interior things of the body terminate, because it contains them, wherefore also they rest upon it. The case is the same with the peritoneum in the body; as this membrane contains the viscera 
of the abdomen, they rest upon it, and also have a general connection with it. It is the same with the pleura relatively to the viscera of the chest. [2] It is the same with all things that belong 
to man's very life, as with those which relate to his understanding, and those which relate to his will. These also follow in order from interior to exterior things. Exterior things are memory-knowledges 
with their pleasant feelings; and outermost things are those of the senses, which communicate with the world by the sight, the hearing, the taste, the smell, and the touch. Upon these the interior 
things rest, for in these they terminate. These are the things which are signified in the spiritual sense by the "covering" or "garment wherein he may sleep." That sensuous things are a "garment" or 
"covering," is from correspondences; for, as before said (n. 9212), spirits and angels appear clothed in garments according to their truths of faith; in shining garments those who are in truths from 
good, as were the angels at the Lord's sepulchre (Luke 24:4; Matt. 28:3); others in white garments of fine linen; as those spoken of in Rev. 19:14; and others in garments of various colors. [3] Be it 
known moreover, that each and all things advance from the first or inmost successively to their ultimates, and there rest; also that prior or interior things have a connection with ultimates in successive 
order. Wherefore if the ultimates are removed, the interior things also are dispersed. From this also there are three heavens; the inmost or third heaven flows into the middle or second heaven; 
the middle or second heaven flows into the first or ultimate heaven; and this again flows in with man. Consequently the human race is the last in order, in which heaven terminates, and upon which it 
rests. Wherefore the Lord always provides from His Divine that there shall be a church among the human race, in which there shall be revealed truth Divine, which on our earth is the Word. By means of 
this, there is a continuous connection of the human race with the heavens. Therefore it is that in every detail of the Word there is an internal sense which is for heaven, and which is of such a nature 
that it conjoins angelic minds with human minds by a bond so close that they act as a one. From this it is again evident how the case is with the resting of interior things upon ultimates. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9216</b></p><p><b>9216.</b>
'In which he may sleep' means resting on them. This is clear from the meaning of 'sleeping' as resting, in this instance on the external and sensory level, meant by 'clothing', <a href="9212.htm">9212</a>; for it says that 
it is clothing 'in which he may sleep'. How the explanation that more internal things find rest on the sensory level should be understood must be stated. The sensory level is the last and lowest of a 
person's life, as has been shown above. What is lowest contains all the more internal levels and is general to them all; for they terminate in it and accordingly rest on it. It is like the skin, for 
example, which is the outermost covering of the body. The body and all things in it terminate in the skin, because it contains them and they accordingly rest on the skin. In a similar way it is like the 
peritoneum within the body. Because it contains the abdominal organs, these rest on it and are also linked to it all round. Or equally it is like the pleura's relationship to the organs in the chest. 
 </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 A similar situation exists with all the things that compose a person's actual life, with those for instance that are connected with his understanding and those that are connected with his will. 
These too follow one another in order from more internal things to relatively external ones. The relatively external ones are factual knowledge together with its delights, while the outermost things 
are those of the senses, which are in contact with the world through sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch. The more internal things rest on them since they terminate in them. These are the matters 
that are meant in the spiritual sense by 'the covering' or 'the clothing in which he may sleep'. The reason why things on the level of the senses are meant by 'the clothing' or 'the covering' lies 
in correspondences; for as stated above in <a href="9212.htm">9212</a>, spirits and angels appear dressed in garments in keeping with their truths of faith. Those governed by truths springing from good appear in shining ones, 
as for instance those at the Lord's tomb did, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2024:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 24:4</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2028:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 28:3</a>, and also in ones of fine, white linen, as for instance those referred to in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2019:14%20d&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 19:14 d</a>id; and others appear in garments of various 
colours.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Furthermore it should be realized that all things without exception proceed in successive stages from their first or inmost level to their terminations on the last and lowest and 
rest on them. Each thing at a prior or more internal stage in order has its own connection with terminations on the lowest level. Therefore if things on the lowest level are dispelled those on interior 
levels are also scattered. This also explains why there are three heavens. The inmost or third heaven flows into the middle or second heaven; the middle or second heaven flows into the first or lowest 
heaven, which in turn flows into and resides with mankind. Consequently the human race constitutes the lowest level of order; in it heaven terminates and on it heaven rests. This being so, the Lord 
in His Divine [Love and Care] always provides for the presence among the human race of a Church in which truth revealed by God exists; such truth on our planet is the Word. By means of this a continuous 
link exists between the human race and the heavens. This is why every detail of the Word has within it an internal sense which exists for heaven's benefit and whose nature is such that it joins 
angels' minds to those of people on earth in so firm a bond that they act as one. All this goes to show yet again the nature of a situation in which interior things rest on those at the lowest level.  </p>

</p><b>9216.</b>
`In qua dormiat': quod significet quietem super illis, constat ex significatione `dormire' quod sit quiescere, hic super sensuali externo, quod significatur per `vestem,' n. 9212, nam dicitur `vestis 
in qua dormiat.' Quomodo intelligendum est quod interiora quietem habeant super sensuali, dicetur: sensuale est ultimum vitae hominis, ut supra ostensum est; quod ultimum est, hoc continet omnia interiora 
et est commune eorum, nam in illud desinunt ac ita super quo quiescunt; sicut pro exemplo cutis, quae ultimum tegumentum corporis est, in {1}illam desinunt interiora corporis, quia continet illa, 
ita quoque quiescunt super illa; similiter in corpore peritonaeum, hoc quia continet viscera abdominis, etiam haec quiescunt super illo, {2}et quoque nexum communem {3}habent cum illo; pariter pleura 
respective ad viscera thoracis. 2 Similiter se habet cum omnibus quae ipsius vitae hominis sunt, prout cum illis quae se referunt ad intellectuale ejus et quae ad voluntarium; haec quoque succedunt 
ordine ab interioribus ad exteriora; exteriora sunt scientifica cum eorum amoenis, et extrema sunt sensualia quae communicant cum mundo, {4}per visum, auditum, gustum, olfactum, et tactum; super his 
quiescunt interiora, nam in illa desinunt; haec sunt quae in sensu spirituali significantur per 'tegumentum' {5}seu `vestem in qua dormiat.' Quod sensualia sint `vestis' aut `tegumentum,' est ex correspondentiis, 
nam, ut supra n. 9212 dictum est, spiritus et angeli apparent (t)vestibus induti secundum vera fidei eorum, splendentibus qui in veris ex bono sunt, prout angeli ad sepulcrum Domini, Luc. 
xxiv 4; Matth. xxviii 3, et quoque byssinis albis, prout illi de quibus in Apocalypsi xix 14, ac vestibus varii coloris alii. Praeterea sciendum {6} quod omnia et singula a primo seu intimo 3 progrediantur 
successive ad sua ultima, et ibi quiescunt; etiam {7} priora seu interiora cum ultimis {8}in successivo ordine nexum habent; quapropter si ultima disparantur, etiam interiora dissipantur; inde 
quoque sunt tres caeli; intimum seu tertium caelum influit in medium seu secundum caelum, medium seu secundum caelum influit in primum seu ultimum caelum, hoc iterum influit apud hominem {9}, inde humanum 
genus est ultimum in ordine, in quod desinit et in quo quiescit caelum; quapropter Dominus ex Divino Suo semper providet ut apud genus humanum Ecclesia sit in qua sit verum Divinum revelatum, quod 
in nostra tellure est Verbum; per hoc datur continens nexus humani generis cum caelis; inde est quod singulis Verbi sensus internus insit, qui pro caelo, qui talis est ut conjungat mentes angelicas 
mentibus humanis vinculo tam stricto ut unum agant; inde iterum patet quomodo se habet cum quiescentia interiorum super ultimis. @1 ea quiescunt omnia quae in corpore sunt$ @2 etiam$ @3 habet cum 
illis$ @4 prout illa quae immediate ex visu, auditu, gustu, olfacto et tactu sunt$ @5 et$ @6 i est$ @7 i ordine$ @8 successive$ @9 i, ac desinit in illum$ </p>
