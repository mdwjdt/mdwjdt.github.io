<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6839节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6839.</strong>“耶和华见他过去要看”表主所带来的反思。这从“过去要看”的含义清楚可知，“过去要看”是指反思，如前所述（<a href="6836.htm">6836</a>节），“耶和华”是指主（参看<a href="1343.htm">1343</a>，<a href="1736.htm">1736</a>，<a href="2921.htm">2921</a>，<a href="3023.htm">3023</a>，<a href="3035.htm">3035</a>，<a href="5663.htm">5663</a>，<a href="6303.htm">6303</a>节）。圣言字义的性质在此也显而易见了。经上说，耶和华见他过去要看，就好像祂事先并不知道摩西要作什么，好像不是祂将这事放在了摩西心中，使他过去看。然而，经上之所以如此说，是因为这符合表象。但内义指示当如何理解这句话，即：主流入他的思维，好叫他反思自己所看到的。由此可见圣言的字义与其内义有什么样的关系。还能看出，字义的内容具有这样的性质：它们适合简单人理解，因为简单人只相信与表象一致的东西。凡与表象不一致的，他们都不信，因为他们没有能力探究更深层次的东西。因此，圣言若在文字上不具这种性质，就不被接受。凡陷入感官力量，专注于世俗事物的人绝无可能理解更深层次的东西。他想亲眼看看他必须相信的事物；他没有看到的东西可以说是外来的。当他靠自己的观念来思想它们时，就会弃绝它们，如同值得否认，或无论如何，值得怀疑的事。</p>

And Jehovah saw that he went aside to see. That this signifies reflection from the Lord, is evident from the signification of "going aside to see," as being reflection (of which above, n. 6836; as also 
that "Jehovah" denotes the Lord, n. 1343, 1736, 2921, 3023, 3035, 5663, 6303). The nature of the sense of the letter of the Word is evident here also. It is said that Jehovah saw that he went aside 
to see, as if He had not known before, and as if He had not enabled him and moved him to go aside to see. Nevertheless it is so said because this is according to the appearance. But the internal sense 
teaches how this is to be understood, namely, that the Lord flowed into his thought, in order that he might reflect upon it. This shows how the case is with the sense of the letter of the Word relatively 
to the internal sense; and that the contents of the sense of the letter are of such a nature as to accommodate themselves to the apprehension of the simple, who believe only as it appears; what 
does not appear they do not believe, because they cannot enter into the interiors of things; and therefore unless the Word had been of this nature in the letter, it would not have been received. He who 
is in sensuous things, and is engrossed by worldly ones, in no wise apprehends interior things. He desires to see the things he must believe; those which he does not see are as it were foreign, and 
when he is thinking from himself about them, he rejects them as matters worthy of denial, or at any rate as worthy of doubt. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6839</b></p><p><b>6839.</b>
'And Jehovah saw that he turned aside to see' means reflection brought about by the Lord. This is clear from the meaning of 'turning aside to see' as reflection, dealt with above in <a href="6836.htm">6836</a>; and 'Jehovah' 
is the Lord, see <a href="1343.htm">1343</a>, <a href="1736.htm">1736</a>, <a href="2921.htm">2921</a>, <a href="3023.htm">3023</a>, <a href="3035.htm">3035</a>, <a href="5667.htm">5667</a>, <a href="6303.htm">6303</a>. What the sense of the letter of the Word is like is also evident here. It says that Jehovah saw that he turned aside to see, as though He 
had not known beforehand what Moses would do, and as though He had not put it into Moses' mind and made him turn aside to see. This way of describing what happened was adopted however because it accorded 
with outward appearances. But the internal sense shows what ought in fact to be understood, which is that the Lord flowed into his thought in such a way that he would reflect on what he beheld. From 
this one can see what the relationship is of the sense of the letter of the Word to its internal sense. One can see that descriptions in the sense of the letter are of a kind suited to the understanding 
of simple people who believe only what agrees with appearances. They do not believe what does not agree with appearances because they have no ability to look into things at a deeper level. That 
being so, unless the Word had been such as it is in the letter it would not have been accepted. A person whose thought is limited to what he apprehends with his senses and who is preoccupied with worldly 
interests cannot understand things at a deeper level. He wishes to see with his own eyes the things he is required to believe; and those he does not see are so to speak foreign. He casts them aside 
as things he refuses to believe, or at best holds in doubt, when he relies on his own ideas to think about them. </p>

`Et vidit Jehovah quod secederet ad videndum': quod significet reflexionem a Domino, constat ex significatione `secedere ad videndum' quod sit reflexio, de qua supra n. 6836; quod `Jehovah' sit Dominus, 
videatur n. 1343, 1736, 2921, 3023, 3035, 5663, 6303.  Qualis sensus litterae (d)Verbi sit, patet etiam hic; dicitur quod `videret Jehovah quod secederet ad videndum,' sicut non novisset prius, et 
sicut non indiderit et egerit ut secederet ad videndum, ita tamen dictum est quia secundum apparentiam; at sensus internus docet quomodo id intelligendum est, quod nempe (t)Dominus influeret in cogitationem 
ejus ut reflecteret super id; inde constare potest quomodo se habet {1}cum sensu litterae Verbi respective ad sensum internum; et quod quae in sensu litterae sunt, talia sint ut accommodent se 
ad captum simplicium, qui non credunt nisi (x)sit sicut apparet; quod non apparet, hoc non credunt quia non intrare possunt in rerum interiora; quapropter nisi Verbum tale fuisset in littera, non receptum 
fuisset; qui in sensualibus est, et qui occupatus a mundanis, nequaquam capit interiora; videre vult {2}quae crede quae non videt, quasi aliena sunt, {3}et rejicit inter negativa, ad minimum inter 
dubia, cum de illis ex se cogitat. 	@1 sensus literae$ 	@2 quod$ 	@3 quae$ </p>
