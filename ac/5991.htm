<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5991节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5991.</strong>我曾看见一些灵人，他们必被称为肉体灵。他们从我右脚底那一面的一个深处上来。在我的灵眼看来，他们仿佛完全住在肉体中。当我问像这样的灵人会是谁时，被告知，他们是那些在世时非常聪明、知识丰富的人；但他们却利用自己的知识使自己完全确认反对神性，因而反对教会的事物。他们已全然确信一切都归于自然界，故比其他人更关闭他们的内层，因而关闭属灵的一切。这就是为何他们看上去完全肉体化。其中有一个人在他活在世上时我就认识他。那时，他因才华和学识而闻名。但是，作为能使人更好地思想神性事物之手段的聪明和学识，在他那里却成了思想反对它们，并使自己确信它们一文不值的手段。因为一个有聪明、学识的人在证明自己的观念方面比其他人拥有更多的资源。因此，我所认识的这个人内在被迷附了，尽管从外表上看，他似乎是一个文明道德、正派得体的人。</p>

I saw spirits who must be called bodily spirits. They rose up from the deep, at the side of the sole of the right foot. They appeared to the sight of my spirit as if in a gross body; and when I asked 
who they are that are like this, it was said that they are those who in the world have excelled in talent, and also in the sciences, and have thereby utterly confirmed themselves against the Divine, 
thus against those things which are of the church; and because they have fully persuaded themselves that all things are of nature, they have more than others closed their interiors, thus all that belongs 
to the spirit. Hence they appear grossly corporeal. Among them was one whom I had known during his life in the world, and who then was celebrated for his talents and his learning. But these gifts, 
which are means of thinking well about Divine things, were to him means of thinking against them, and of persuading himself that they are of no account; for he who excels in talent and learning excels 
also in the means of confirmation. Hence he had been interiorly obsessed, but in the external form he had appeared as a man of civic and moral virtues. </p>

I once saw some spirits who must be called bodily or physical ones. They rose up from a deep place on the side of the sole of my right foot. It looked to the eyes of my spirit as though they inhabited 
thoroughly physical bodies. When I asked who spirits like these might be I was told that they were those who in the world had been clever and very knowledgeable; but they had used their knowledge entirely 
to reinforce themselves in their opposition to the Divine, and so to the things of the Church. And since they had become fully convinced that everything could be attributed to natural forces, they 
had shut themselves off more than others from interior things, thus from things of the spirit. This is why they had a thoroughly physical appearance. Among them was one whom I had known when he lived 
in the world. At that time he had been one of those quite renowned for their clever abilities and their learning. But that cleverness and learning, which are the means to enable a person to think 
clearly about Divine matters, were for that man the means to think in opposition to them and to convince himself that they were valueless. For a person well endowed with cleverness and learning has more 
resources for proving his ideas than others have. Consequently the one I had known was interiorly possessed, though in outward appearance he seemed to be a decent and properly-behaved person.  </p>

Visi mihi sunt spiritus qui dicendi sunt corporei; {1}assurgebant e profundo ad latus plantae pedis dextri; apparuerunt coram visu mei spiritus sicut in crasso corpore; cumque interrogavi quinam essent 
qui tales, dictum est quod sint illi qui in mundo polluerunt ingenio, et quoque scientiis, et {2}per illa se prorsus confirmaverunt contra Divinum, ita contra illa quae Ecclesiae sunt, et quia sibi 
plane persuaserunt quod omnia naturae {3}essent, clauserunt sibi plus quam alii interiora, ita illa quae spiritus sunt; inde {4}crasse corporei apparent. (m)Inter illos fuit unus qui cum vixit in mundo, 
mihi notus; is tunc inter celebratiores fuit propter ingenii dotes et eruditionem; sed haec  quae sunt media cogitandi bene de {5}Divinis, (t)fuerunt ei media cogitandi contra illa et {6}sibi persuadendi 
quod nihil sint, qui enim ingenio et eruditione pollet, is plura quam alii habet, quibus confirmat; inde {7}ille interius fuit obsessus, sed {8}in externa forma apparuit ut civilis et moratus 
homo.(n) @1 exsurgebant$ @2 se confirmarunt per illa prorsus$ @3 sint$ @4 i tam$ @5 Divino$ @6 i per illa$ @7 etiam$ @8 exterius$ </p>
