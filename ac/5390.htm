<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5390节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5390.</strong>有些灵人也对应于污秽的排泄物，这些灵人就是在世时执意复仇、不屈不挠的那种人。我看见这些人在我前面、左边。那些败坏属灵事物，将其贬为世俗事物的人也对应于这些污秽的排泄物。这类灵人来到我这里，带来他们污秽的思维。这些思维也引导他们说污秽的话；更糟糕的是，他们将洁净事物扭曲为不洁的事物，并将它们变为这类事物。许多这类灵人来源于社会最低层；但他们也来自其它各阶层的人，在世时属高层之列。诚然，在肉身生活期间，后者与别人在一起时没有表达恶意的观念；但他们仍思想它们；他们克制自己不将他们所想的说出来，以避免名声败坏，或丧失友谊、物质利益和他们所享有的重要地位。然而，在他们这类人中间，当处于自由时，他们的谈话就像社会最底层之人的，甚至更污秽，因为他们有智力，会滥用这智力来玷污圣言和教义的神圣观念。</p>

There are other spirits also who correspond to unclean excretions, namely, such as in the world have been tenacious of revenge: these appeared to me in front to the left. To these unclean excretions 
also correspond those who debase spiritual things to unclean earthly ones. Such spirits came to me and brought with them filthy thoughts, from which they spoke filthy things, and also warped clean things 
to unclean things, and turned them into such. Many of this kind had belonged to the lowest orders, and some to people of higher station in the world, who during their bodily life had not indeed so 
spoken in company, but still had so thought; for they had refrained from speaking as they thought, lest they should come to shame, and lose friendship, gain, and honor. Nevertheless, among their like, 
when in freedom, their conversation had been like that of the lowest orders, and even fouler, because they possessed a certain intellectual capacity which they misused to defile even the holy things 
of the Word and of doctrine. </p>

There are other spirits again who correspond to filthy excretions, these being the kind who in the world were firmly set on taking vengeance. I have seen these in front of me, over to the left. Also 
corresponding to those filthy excretions are people who have debased spiritual ideas into filthy earthly ones. Spirits such as these have also approached me, bringing their foul thoughts with them. Those 
thoughts also led them to say things that were foul; and worse than that, they turned pure ideas towards unclean ones and converted them into the same. A large number of spirits like these have sprung 
from the lowest level of society; but they also came from other levels of people who in the world were among the higher-ranking. During their lifetimes the latter did not, it is true, express foul 
ideas in company, even though they thought them; they refrained from speaking what they thought, to avoid ill repute or loss of the friendships, material advantages, and important positions they enjoyed. 
Otherwise, when among others like themselves and at liberty to do so, they uttered the same kinds of things as those belonging to the lowest level of society. Indeed what they spoke was even fouler 
because they had an intellectual ability which they misused to defile even those holy ideas contained in the Word and religious teaching. </p>

Excretionibus immundis correspondent etiam {1} alii spiritus, nempe {2} tales qui in mundo {3} vindictae tenaces fuerunt; apparuerunt hi mihi antrorsum {4} versus sinistrum; {5} excretionibus illis 
immundis etiam correspondent qui spiritualia ad terrestria immunda deducunt; adveniebant etiam tales, et secum ferebant cogitationes spurcas, ex quibus {6} etiam spurca loquebantur, tum quoque quae munda 
fuerunt, ad immunda flectebant, et in talia vertebant; ejus generis plures fuerunt et infima plebe, etiam ex aliis qui in mundo inter digniores; hi quidem in vita corporis non ita locuti sunt in consortiis, 
sed usque ita cogitarunt, inhibuerunt enim se loqui sicut cogitarunt {7} ne sic in infamiam venirent, et perderent amicitias, lucra et honores, at usque inter similes sui, cum in libero, loquela 
fuerat qualis infimae plebis, et adhuc foedior, quia facultate quadam intellectuali {8} praediti sunt, qua abusi {9} ad conspurcandum etiam sancta Verbi et doctrinae. </p>
