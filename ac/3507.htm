<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3507节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3507.</strong>“以撒对他儿子以扫说话，利百加也听见了”表对真理的情感和出于这情感的生命。 这从“利百加”的代表和“听见以撒说话”的褒义清楚可知：“利百加”是指主的神圣理性的神圣真理（这神圣真理已与神圣理性的神圣良善结合），因而是指对真理的情感；“听见以撒说话”是指出于这情感的生命。因为就内义而言，“听某人说话”表流注，因为就代表意义而言，“听”表顺从（参看<a href="2542.htm">2542</a>节）；“说话”表意愿和流入（<a href="2626.htm">2626</a>，<a href="2951.htm">2951</a>，<a href="3037.htm">3037</a>节）；因此，就至高意义而言，“听某人说话”表出于这情感的生命，也就是说，从神圣良善所接受的神圣真理的生命。“他儿子”在内义上涉及属世层的良善，并由此涉及属世层的真理。由于与字义，也就是历史意义相距甚远，故这些话的含义几乎不明显；然而，这种含义确实存在。<br />事实上，天使观念完全不同于人类观念。天使的观念是属灵的，它们变得越发内在时，就是属天的；而人类观念是属世的，当来源于历史时，就是感官的。不过，主通过圣言实现了这种属天堂的属灵之物与属尘世的属世之物之间的对应关系，以致属世观念能在一瞬间转化为属灵观念。因此，天堂通过人类，尤其通过圣言，因而通过拥有圣言的教义而尘世联结。属世之物与属灵之物的对应关系存在于能被心智所理解和感知的每一个事物中。蒙主神圣怜悯，这一事实从下面各章末尾有关巨人的经历陈述明显看出来。</p>

And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. That this signifies the affection of truth and life therefrom, is evident from the representation of Rebekah, as being the Lord's Divine rational as 
to Divine truth conjoined with the Divine good therein, thus the very affection of truth and from the signification of "hearing Isaac speak," as being life from it; for in the internal sense "to hear 
speak" denotes influx, because in the representative sense "to hear" denotes to obey (see n. 2542); and "to speak" denotes to will and flow in (n. 2626, 2951, 3037); thus in the supreme sense "to hear 
speak" denotes life therefrom, namely, the life of Divine truth from Divine good; "to his son" in the internal sense denotes concerning the good of the natural, and thence the truth of the natural. 
That this is the sense of these words does not so plainly appear, because it is widely removed from the sense of the letter, which is historical; nevertheless such is the case, for angelic ideas are 
altogether unlike human ideas. Angelic ideas are spiritual, and when they penetrate inwardly they are celestial; but human ideas are natural, and when derived from historicals, are sensuous. And yet the 
Lord effects through the Word such a correspondence between spiritual things which are of heaven and natural things which are of the world, that natural ideas may be changed into spiritual, and this 
in a moment. From this comes the conjunction of heaven with the world through man, and indeed through the Word, consequently through the church in which is the Word. That there is a correspondence between 
natural and spiritual things in each and all of those things which can possibly be apprehended and perceived by the mind, will of the Lord's Divine mercy become evident from what is related from 
experience concerning the Grand Man, at the end of the following chapters. </p>

'Rebekah was listening to Isaac while he spoke to [Esau] his son' means the affection for truth and the life from that affection. This is clear from the representation of 'Rebekah' as the Lord's Divine 
Rational as regards Divine Truth joined to Divine Good there, and so as the affection itself for truth; and from the meaning of 'listening to Isaac while he spoke' as the life from that affection. 
For in the internal sense 'listening to someone speaking' means influx, and it does so because in the representative sense 'listening to' means being obedient, <a href="2542.htm">2542</a>, and 'speaking' means willing and flowing 
in, <a href="2626.htm">2626</a>, <a href="2952.htm">2952</a>, <a href="3037.htm">3037</a>; so that in the highest sense 'listening to someone speaking' is the life from that affection, that is to say, the life of Divine Truth received from Divine Good. 'To his son' 
in the internal sense has reference to the good of the natural and from this to the truth of the natural. Being far removed from the sense of the letter, which is the historical sense, the meaning 
held within these words is scarcely apparent; but such a meaning is nevertheless present there. </p>

 Indeed angelic ideas are not at all like human ideas. Angelic ideas are spiritual; and when they 
become more interior they are celestial, whereas human ideas are natural, and when formed from things that happened in history are sensory impressions. The Lord however has effected through the Word 
such a correspondence between spiritual things which belong to heaven and natural ones which belong to the world that natural ideas are converted in an instant into spiritual ones. Consequently heaven 
is joined to the world through mankind, and in particular through the Word, and so through the Church in which the Word is present. The fact that the correspondence of natural things and spiritual exists 
in every single thing that can be grasped and perceived mentally will in the Lord's Divine mercy be clear from what is to be stated from experience about the Grand Man at the ends of chapters below. </p>

`Rebecca audiens in loquendo Jishak ad filium suum': quod significet affectionem veri et vitam ex illa, constat ex repraesentatione `Rebeccae' quod sit Divinum Rationale Domini quoad Divinum Verum conjunctum 
Divino Bono ibi, ita quod ipsa affectio veri; et ex significatione `audiens in loquendo Jishak' quod sit vita inde; `audire enim in loquendo' in sensu interno est influxus, ex eo quod `audire' 
in sensu repraesentativo sit obtemperare, n. 2542, et `loqui' sit velle (c)et influere, n. 2626, 2951, 3037, ita in supremo sensu `audiens in loquendo' est vita inde, nempe Divini Veri ex Divino Bono; 
`ad filium suum' in sensu interno est de bono naturalis, et inde vero naturalis: quod ille sensus eorum verborum sit, quia admodum discedit a sensu litterae qui historicus, non ita apparet; at usque 
talis est; angelicae enim ideae prorsus dissimiles sunt ideis humanis; [2] {1}angelicae sunt spirituales, et cum interius vadunt, sunt caelestes; humanae autem sunt naturales, et cum {2}ex historicis 
sunt, sunt sensuales; sed usque a Domino talis correspondentia inter spiritualia quae sunt caeli et naturalia quae sunt mundi, per Verbum facta est, ut ideae naturales vertantur in spirituales, et 
hoc momento; inde est conjunctio caeli cum mundo per hominem, et quidem per Verbum, proinde per Ecclesiam in qua Verbum:  quod correspondentia naturalium et spiritualium sit in omnibus et singulis quae 
usque mente capi et percipi possunt, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, constabit ex illis quae de Maximo Homine ad finem capitum sequentium, ab experientia dicendum. @1 sunt enim angelicae$  @2 in$  </p>
