<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6587节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6587.</strong>“约瑟对他弟兄们说，我要死了”表对教会的内在即将结束的一个预言。这从“约瑟”的代表和“要死”的含义清楚可知：“约瑟”是指内在（参看<a href="6499.htm">6499</a>节），在此是指教会的内在，因为前文论述的主题一直是教会通过内在的建立，也就是主通过内在对教会的建立；“要死”是指不再是这个样子（<a href="494.htm">494</a>节），因而是指即将结束。“死”也表示教会的末期（参看<a href="2908.htm">2908</a>，<a href="2912.htm">2912</a>，<a href="2917.htm">2917</a>，<a href="2923.htm">2923</a>节）。“约瑟对他弟兄们说”表示关于这末期的预言；因为下文直到本章末尾论述的主题是教会进一步的状态。由此明显可知，“约瑟对他弟兄们说，我要死了”表示教会的内在即将结束。<br />此中情形是这样：教会若要存在，就必是内在和外在的；因为有些人处于教会的内在，有些人处于教会的外在；前者为数很少，后者为数众多。然而，有内在教会存在的人也必有外在教会，因为教会的内在与外在是不可分割的；有外在教会存在的人也必有内在教会，只是对他们来说，内在教会存在于模糊之中。<br />教会的内在就在于从心里意愿良善，被良善所打动；而这个内在的外在则在于行善，并且是照着人从良善所知道的信之真理而行的。但教会的外在则在于虔诚地执行宗教仪式，实践教会所教导的仁爱行为。由此明显可知，教会的内在是意愿中的仁之良善。因此，当这内在即将结束时，教会本身也即将结束，因为仁之良善是教会的本质要素。诚然，此后外在敬拜仍旧保留，和以前一样；然而，这时它不是敬拜，而是一种仪式，这种仪式之所以被保存下来，是因为它是既定的习俗。但这种看似敬拜的仪式就像一个没有内核的外壳；因为它是一种虽保留下来，却没有任何内在之物在里面的外在。当教会处于这样一种状态时，它就走到了尽头。</p>

And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die. That this signifies a prediction that the internal of the church will cease, is evident from the representation of Joseph, as being the internal (see n. 6499), 
here the internal of the church, because in what precedes the subject treated of has been the church set up again by the internal, that is, through the internal by the Lord; and from the signification 
of "dying," as being to cease to be such (n. 494); thus to cease. (That "dying" denotes the last time of the church, may be seen above, n. 2908, 2912, 2917, 2923.) Prediction concerning this time 
is signified by "Joseph said unto his brethren;" for in what now follows, even to the end, the subject treated of is the further state of the church. Hence it is plain that by "Joseph said unto his brethren, 
I die," is signified that the internal of the church will cease. [2] The case herein is this. A church in order to exist must be internal and external, for there are those who are in the internal 
of the church, and those who are in its external; the former are few, but the latter are very numerous. Nevertheless with those with whom is the internal church, the external must be also, for the 
internal of the church cannot be separated from its external; and also with those with whom is the external church, the internal must be also, but with these the internal is in obscurity. [3] The internal 
of the church consists in willing good from the heart, and in being affected with good; and its external consists in doing it, and this according to the truth of faith which the man knows from 
good; but the external of the church consists in the devout performance of rituals, and in doing works of charity, according to the precepts of the church. From this it is evident that the internal of 
the church is the good of charity in the will. Therefore when this ceases, the church itself also ceases, for the good of charity is its essential. External worship indeed remains afterward, as before, 
but then it is not worship, but a rite, which is preserved because it has been so appointed; but this rite, which appears like worship, is like a shell without a kernel, for it is an external which 
remains wherein is no internal. When such is the state of the church it is at its end. </p>

'And Joseph said to his brothers, I am dying' means a foretelling that the internal of the Church is about to come to an end. This is clear from the meaning of 'Joseph' as the internal, dealt with in <a href="6499.htm">6499</a>, here the internal of the Church since the establishment of the Church by the internal, that is, by the Lord through the internal, has been the subject in what has gone before; and from the meaning 
of 'dying' as ceasing to be such, dealt with in <a href="494.htm">494</a>, thus coming to an end. 'Dying' also means the final period of the Church, <a href="2908.htm">2908</a>, <a href="2912.htm">2912</a>, <a href="2917.htm">2917</a>, <a href="2923.htm">2923</a>; and a foretelling regarding that final period 
is meant by 'Joseph said to his brothers', for in what follows from here to the end of the chapter the subject is a further state of the Church. From all this it is evident that 'Joseph said to his brothers, 
I am dying' means that the internal of the Church is about to come to an end. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The situation is that for the Church to exist it must be internal and external; for there are those who are 
in the internal domain of the Church and there are those who are in its external domain, the former being few, but the latter very many. Even so, those with whom the internal Church exists must have 
the external Church with them also, for the internal of the Church is inseparable from its external; and those with whom the external Church exists must have the internal Church with them also, though 
with them the internal Church exists in obscurity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The internal of the Church consists in willing good from the heart and being stirred by an affection for good, while the external of that internal 
consists in performing such good and doing so in accordance with the truth of faith, the knowledge of which springs from good. But the external of the Church consists in the sacred performance 
of religious observances and the practice of charitable works as instructed by the Church. From all this it is clear that the internal of the Church is the good of charity in the will. Therefore when 
this comes to an end the Church itself also comes to an end, for the good of charity is the essential constituent of the Church. After that external worship does, it is true, remain as it was before; 
yet now it is not worship but ceremony which is preserved because it is the established custom. But such ceremony, which seems to be worship, is like the shell without the nut; for it is the external 
that remains but does not have anything internal within it. When the Church is like this it is at its end. </p>

`Et dixit Joseph ad fratres suos, Ego morior': quod significet praedictionem quod cessaturum internum Ecclesiae, constat ex repraesentatione `Josephi' quod sit internum, de qua n. 6499, hic internum 
Ecclesiae, quia de Ecclesia instaurata ab interno, hoc est, per internum a Domino, in praecedentibus actum est; et ex significatione `mori' quod sit desinere esse tale, de qua n. 494, ita cessare; et 
quod mori sit ultimum tempus Ecclesiae, n. 2908, 2912, 2917, 2923; praedictio de hoc tempore significatur per `dixit Joseph ad fratres suos', nam in nunc sequentibus usque ad finem {1} agitur de ulteriore 
statu Ecclesiae; [2] inde patet quod per `dixit Joseph ad fratres suos, Ego morior' significetur quod cessaturum internum Ecclesiae.  Cum hoc ita se habet: ut Ecclesia sit, erit illa interna et 
externa, {2}nam sunt qui in interno Ecclesiae sunt, et sunt qui in externo ejus sunt, illi pauci sunt, hi autem perplures; at usque apud quos Ecclesia interna est, etiam externa erit, nam internum Ecclesiae 
non separari potest ab externo ejus; et quoque apud quos Ecclesia externa est, etiam interna erit, sed interna apud hos est in obscuro.[3] Internum Ecclesiae consistit in velle bonum ex corde et 
affici bono, et externum ejus est agere illud, et hoc secundum verum fidei quod ex bono novit; externum autem Ecclesiae est obire sancte ritualia et charitatis opera facere secundum praecepta Ecclesiae; 
ex quibus constat quod internum Ecclesiae sit bonum charitatis voluntate; hoc itaque cum cessat, etiam ipsa Ecclesia cessat, nam bonum charitatis est essentiale ejus; remanet quidem postea cultus 
externus, sicut prius, sed tunc non est cultus sed est ritus qui conservatur quia ita institutum est; sed ritus hic, qui apparet sicut cultus, est sicut crusta absque nucleo, nam est externum quod manet, 
in quo non aliquid internum; cum talis est Ecclesia, (x)in fine suo est. @1 i capitis$ @2 et quidem ita ut$ @3 i Ecclesiae$ </p>
