<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2373节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2373.</strong>“现在我们要害你比害他们更甚”表他们拒绝仁之善比拒绝主的神圣人性和神圣活动更甚。这从“罗得”和“这两个人”或天使的含义清楚可知，“罗得”是指仁之善，因为罗得代表那些具有仁之善的人（<a href="2324.htm">2324</a>，<a href="2351.htm">2351</a>，<a href="2371.htm">2371</a>节）；而“这两个人”或天使是指主的神圣人性和神圣活动（参看前文）。由此明显可知，“害你比害他们更甚”具有这样的含义。那些沉浸于邪恶的教会中人拒绝仁爱比否认主更甚，原因在于，他们在这样做时能通过一种表面宗教来支持自己的私欲，并进行没有内在的外在敬拜，也就是口头上的敬拜而非发自内心的敬拜；他们越视这种敬拜为神性和神圣，所取得的地位和财富就越大。除此之外有很多其它虽隐藏起来，却又显而易见的原因。然而，事情的真相是，人若拒绝仁爱，也就是说，既从教义上，同时还在生活中拒绝它，也会拒绝主。尽管他不敢公然这样做，但会在心里这样行。这就是此处经上说所多玛人“要攻破房门”字面上所表达的，这句话的意思是，他们甚至试图竭力摧毁这二者。不过，阻止这种努力付诸行动的事决不会隐藏起来。</p>

Now will we do worse to thee than to them. That this signifies that they would reject the good of charity more than the Lord's Divine Human and Holy proceeding, is evident from the signification of "Lot," 
as being the good of charity; for Lot represents those who are in the good of charity (n. 2324, 2351, 2371); and from the signification of the "men," or "angels," as being the Lord as to the Divine 
Human and Holy proceeding (see above). Hence it is evident that to "do worse to thee than to them" has this meaning. The reason why they who are in evil within the church reject charity more than 
they deny the Lord, is that in this way they can favor their concupiscences by a kind of religion, and have external worship with no internal (that is, worship of the lips and not of the heart), and the 
more they make this worship to be Divine and holy, so much the greater are their dignities and wealth, besides many other causes that are hidden and yet are manifest. Nevertheless the truth really 
is that he who rejects the one (that is, does so in doctrine and at the same time in life) rejects also the other (for even if he dare not do this openly he does it in his heart); and this is here expressed 
in the sense of the letter by its being said that the men of Sodom drew near to break open the door, by which is signified that they came even to the endeavor to destroy both. But that which prevents 
this endeavor from bursting forth into act is by no means hidden. </p>

'Now we will do more harm to you than to them' means that they would reject the good of charity even more than they rejected the Lord's Divine Human and His Holy proceeding. This becomes clear from the 
meaning of 'Lot' as good that flows from charity, for Lot represents those with whom the good of charity is present, <a href="2324.htm">2324</a>, <a href="2351.htm">2351</a>, <a href="2371.htm">2371</a>; and from the meaning of 'the men', who were angels, as the Lord 
as regards the Divine Human and His Holy proceeding, dealt with above. From this it is evident that 'doing more harm to you than to them' has this meaning. Those inside the Church who are immersed in 
evil reject charity even more than they deny the Lord, the reason being that in so doing they can look favourably upon their own lusts through a semblance of religion and engage in external worship 
which has no internal, that is, a worship of the lips and not of the heart; and the more they regard this worship to be Divine and Holy, the greater the positions and wealth they attain. And in addition 
to this there are many other hidden yet manifest reasons. For the fact of the matter is that the person who rejects charity, that is to say, rejects it in doctrine and at the same time in life, also 
rejects the Lord. Though he does not dare to do so with the lips he nevertheless does so in his heart, a fact which is expressed even in the sense of the letter by the statement 'they came near to break 
down the door' which means that they went so far as to try and destroy them both. But what prevents the actual realization of the attempt is no hidden matter. </p>

</p><b>2373.</b>
Quod `nunc malefaciemus tibi prae illis' significet quod bonum charitatis magis rejicerent quam Divinum Humanum Sanctum procedens Domini, constare potest a significatione `Loti quod sit bonum charitatis, 
Lot enim repraesentat eos qui in bono charitatis sunt, n. 2324, 2351, 2371; et a significatione virorum {1} seu angelorum, quod sit Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum et Sanctum procedens, de qua supra; 
inde patet quod `malefacere tibi prae illis' sit ille sensus.  Quod illi qui in malo sunt {2} intra Ecclesiam, rejiciant magis charitatem quam negent Dominum, causa est quod sic concupiscentiis suis 
favere possint per religiosum quoddam, ac habere cultum externum interno nullo, hoc est, cultum oris non cordis, quem cultum quo magis Divinum et Sanctum faciunt, eo magis in dignitate sunt et in lucro; 
praeter plures alias causas quae latent, sed usque patent: cum tamen ita se res habet quod, qui rejicit unum, nempe doctrina et simul vita, etiam rejiciat alterum; si non ausit ore, usque facit 
corde; quod etiam exprimitur in sensu litterae per quod `accesserint ad effringendum ostium,' quo significatur quod venerint usque ad conatum destruendi utrumque; sed quid conatum ibi quin in actum erumpat, 
nec latet. 	@1 i duorum.$ 	@2 After Ecclesiam.$ </p>
