<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第363节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>363.</strong>从本节的描述可以看出被称为“该隐”的信之教义的性质，以下解释表明，仁能被联结于信，但这样做使得仁而非信拥有统治权。正因如此，所以先说“你若行得好，岂不应仰起脸？”意思是，若你所愿是善，仁就会存在。“行得好”在内义上表善愿，因为善行源于善愿。古时，行为与意愿为一，从行为能看出意愿，那时人们不知道伪装。“仰起”表仁存在，这一点从前文对“脸”的阐述明显可知；“仰起脸”就是拥有仁，“脸沉下来”则没有仁。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]363.</strong> The nature of the doctrine of faith that was called Cain can be found in this verse's description of him. The later parts of the verse indicate that charity could have been joined onto faith but only in such a way that charity would rule, not faith. So it says first, if you do well, it will raise you up, meaning if you wish well, charity can be present. In the inner sense, doing well means willing well, because good deeds flow from goodwill. Action and will formed a single entity in ancient times. The action allowed people to see the will, because pretense was wholly absent.<br />What was said earlier [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_363/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_358" target=_top>358</a>] about the face shows that a raising [or lifting] symbolizes the presence of charity, since to lift one's face is to display charity and the falling of one's face is the opposite. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 363</b></p><p><b>363.</b>
The nature of the doctrine of faith that was called "Cain" is seen from the description of it in this verse, from which it appears that charity was capable of being joined to faith, but so that charity 
and not faith should have the dominion. On this account it is first said, "If thou doest well art thou not uplifted?" signifying, If thou art well disposed, charity may be present; for to "do well" 
signifies, in the internal sense, to be well disposed, since doing what is good comes from willing what is good. In ancient times action and will made a one; from the action they saw the will, dissimulation 
being then unknown. That an "uplifting" signifies that charity is present, is evident from what has been already said about the face, that to "lift up the face" is to have charity, and that for 
the "face to fall" is the contrary. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 363</b></p><p><b>363.</b>
The nature of the doctrine of faith called Cain is clear from the description of it given in this verse. The following explanation of the contents of the verse shows that charity was capable of being 
allied to faith, but only if this resulted in charity and not faith being the superior. (<a href="1.htm">1</a>) 'If you do there is an uplifting', which means that if your desires are good, charity might be present. 'Doing 
well' means in the internal sense desiring well, for the doing of a good deed flows from the desiring of it. In ancient times deed and will made one, and from the deed people caught sight of the 
will, for pretence did not exist at all. That 'uplifting means the presence of charity is clear from what has been stated already about the face,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> that is to say, about 'lifting up the face'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> meaning 
possession of charity, and about 'the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> falling' meaning the reverse.

Qualis doctrina fidei fuerit quae 'Cain' dicta, constat ex descriptione ejus in hoc versu; a sequentibus in hoc versu, quod charitas potuisset adjuncta esse fidei, sed ita ut charitas dominaretur, non 
fides; quare dicitur primum 'Si benefacis, elevatio,' quo significatur, si benevis, charitas posset adesse; 'benefacere' significat in sensu interno benevelle, nam facere bonum a velle bonum profluit; 
antiquitus actio et voluntas unum faciebant, ex actione conspiciebant voluntatem, quia nihil simulati erat. Quod 'elevatio' significet quod charitas adsit, constat ab illis quae prius dicta sunt de 
faciebus, quod 'elevare facies' sit charitatem habere; et 'cadere facies,' quod sit contrarium. </p>
