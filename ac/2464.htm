<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2464节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2464.</strong>“和他两个女儿”表源于这良善的情感，就是对这种良善和这种虚假的情感。这从“女儿”的含义清楚可知，“女儿”是指情感（<a href="2461.htm">2461</a>节）。这些情感所源自的良善，或生育这些女儿的父亲就是“罗得”；而这些情感所源自的真理，或女儿的母亲则是“罗得的妻子”。当她变成一根盐柱时，也就是说，当真理里面的良善荒凉时，“住在洞里的罗得”所表示的这种良善，和“女儿”所表示的、源于这良善的这种情感就出现了。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2464</b></p><p><b>2464.</b>
And his two daughters. That this signifies the affections thence derived, which are those of such good and such falsity, is evident from the signification of "daughters," as being affections (n. 2461). 
The good from which came these affections, or the father from whom came these daughters, was Lot; and the truth from which came these affections, or the mother of the daughters, was Lot's wife; and 
when she was made a pillar of salt, that is, when the good of truth was vastated, then there came forth such good as is signified by "Lot in the cave," and such affections thence derived as are signified 
by the "daughters." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2464</b></p><p><b>2464.</b>
'And his two daughters' means affections deriving from that good- affections for that kind of good and for that kind of falsity. This is clear from the meaning of 'daughters' as affections, <a href="2461.htm">2461</a>. The 
good from which the affections were derived, that is, the father from whom the daughters were begotten, is 'Lot'. But the truth, or the mother, from whom they came, was 'Lot's wife'. When she has become 
a pillar of salt, that is, when good within truth has been vastated, such good as is meant by 'Lot in the cave', and such affections deriving from that good as are meant by 'the daughters' in that 
case manifest themselves. </p>

</p><b>2464.</b>
`Et duae filiae ejus': quod significent affectiones inde, quae sunt talis boni et talis falsi, constat a significatione `filiarum' quod sint affectiones, n. 2461.  Bonum ex quo affectiones, seu pater 
ex quo filiae, est {1} `Lot'; at verum ex quo illae, seu mater, erat `uxor Loti,' quae cum facta statua salis, hoc est, cum bonum veri vastatum {2}, tunc tale bonum quod significatur per `Lotum in spelunca,' 
et tales affectiones inde quae significantur per `filias,' existunt. 	@1 i hic.$ 	@2 cum verum vastatur.$ </p>
