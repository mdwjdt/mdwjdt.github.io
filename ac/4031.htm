<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4031节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4031.</strong>“只是在后聚集起来的羊群眼前不插枝子”表强迫的事物。这从“后聚集起来”的含义清楚可知。“先聚集起来”表自发或自由的事物，如前所示（<a href="4029.htm">4029</a>节）。由此明显可知，“后聚集起来”表示强迫或不自由的事物。这一点也可从以下事实明显可知：此处没有像论及先聚集起来的羊群那样提到“发热”；因为“发热”表示情感，在这种情况下表示一种强烈的渴望。凡非始于情感的，都不是自发的或自由的，自发或自由的一切事物皆与人的情感或爱一致（<a href="2870.htm">2870</a>节）。这一点同样从原文中这个词的衍生意义明显看出来，即意思是缺乏；因为若缺乏强烈的渴望，一切自由的感觉就会停止；在这种情况下所行的，可以说不是自由的，最终可以说是强迫的。<br />从前面（<a href="4029.htm">4029</a>节）所引用的章节可以看出，真理与良善的一切结合，因而一切改造和重生都是在自由中实现的，也就是说，都是自发的结果。所以，若缺乏自由，也就是通过强迫，真理与良善的结合，因而重生是不可能实现的。至于何为自由及其来源，可参看前文（<a href="2870.htm">2870</a>-<a href="2893.htm">2893</a>节），那里论述了人的自由。凡在推理关于主的圣治，人的得救，许多人的永恒诅咒时没有意识到真理与良善的结合，或使这些成为自己的，因而重生若不在人的自由状态下，是不可能实现的人就将自己投入纯粹的阴暗中，因而陷入严重的错误。因为他以为，主若愿意，就能拯救每个人，并且通过无数方法来这样做，如通过神迹，死人复活，直接启示，让天使将世人从邪恶中拉回来并强力将他们驱入良善，通过人被引入并悔改所在的许多状态，以及其它许多方法。<br />殊不知，所有这些方法都包含强迫，没有人能通过强迫被改造。因为凡强迫人的事物都不会赋予他任何情感；或即便它具有这样的性质，即它能赋予一种情感，它也会将自己弯向对邪恶的情感。诚然，它似乎流入，也的确注入了某种神性事物；但当此人的状态发生改变时，他又回到先前的情感，即邪恶与虚假中；这时，神圣事物便与邪恶并虚假结合，沦为亵渎，然后就具有诸如将他引入最糟糕地狱这样的性质。因为此人首先承认和相信，也拥有对神圣之物的情感，但后来又否认，甚至厌恶它。亵渎者指的是那些曾发自内心承认，后来又否认的人，而不是那些没有发自内心承认的人（<a href="301.htm">301</a>-<a href="303.htm">303</a>，<a href="571.htm">571</a>，<a href="582.htm">582</a>，<a href="593.htm">593</a>，<a href="1001.htm">1001</a>，<a href="1008.htm">1008</a>，<a href="1010.htm">1010</a>，<a href="1059.htm">1059</a>，<a href="1327.htm">1327</a>，<a href="1328.htm">1328</a>，<a href="2051.htm">2051</a>，<a href="2426.htm">2426</a>，<a href="3398.htm">3398</a>，<a href="3399.htm">3399</a>，<a href="3402.htm">3402</a>，<a href="3898.htm">3898</a>节）。因此，如今不再发生明显的神迹，只发生一些不太明显或不引人注目的神迹，这些神迹具有这样的性质：它们不会强力激发神圣感，或夺走人的自由。这就是为何死人不再复活，为何没有人通过直接的启示，或通过天使远离罪恶，或简单的使用武力被引向良善。<br />主在人的自由中作工，并通过自由使他转回。因为一切自由都属于他的爱或情感，因而属于他的意愿（<a href="3158.htm">3158</a>节）。若人不在自由中接受良善与真理，这良善与真理就不可能归给他，或变成他自己的。因为对人来说，凡被迫的事，都不是他的，而是属于进行强迫之人的，哪怕这事是他所做的，他也不是凭自己做的。表面上看，有时人似乎被迫向善，如在试探和属灵的争战中，但这时他所拥有的自由比其它任何时候都要大（参看<a href="1937.htm">1937</a>，<a href="1947.htm">1947</a>，<a href="2881.htm">2881</a>节）。当人强迫自己行善时，似乎他也是被迫行善；但自我强迫是一回事，被（别人）强迫则是另一回事。对任何人来说，自我强迫是出于他里面的自由，而被（别人）强迫则不是出于自由。既然如此，那么明显可知，那些推理主的圣治、人的得救，许多人的永恒诅咒，却不知道主通过自由，绝非通过强迫作工之人陷入何等的阴暗，因而陷入何等的错误。因为具有神圣性质的事若不是自由地被接受，强迫是危险的。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4031</b></p><p><b>4031.</b>
And to the flock that came together later he did not set them. That this signifies things that are compelled, is evident from the signification of "coming together later." That "coming together first" 
signifies that which is spontaneous or free, has been shown above (n. 4029). That "coming together later" signifies that which is compulsory or not free, is thereby evident, and also from the connection 
of things in the internal sense; as well as from the fact that "growing warm" is not here spoken of, as it is of those that came together first; for by "growing warm" is signified affection, and 
there the ardor of affection. Whatever is not from affection is from what is not spontaneous, or not free, for everything spontaneous or free is of affection or love (n. 2870). The same is evident also 
from the derivation of the expression in the original language, as meaning deficiency; for when ardor of affection is deficient, then freedom ceases; and what is then done is said to be not free, and 
at last compulsory. [2] That all the conjunction of truth and good is effected in freedom, or from what is spontaneous, and consequently all reformation and regeneration, may be seen from the passages 
cited above (n. 4029); and consequently that in the absence of freedom (that is, by compulsion) no conjunction, and thus no regeneration, can be effected. (What freedom is, and whence it is, may be 
seen above, n. 2870-2893, where man's freedom is treated of.) He who while reasoning concerning the Lord's Providence, man's salvation, and the damnation of many, is not aware that no conjunction of 
truth and good, or appropriation, and thus no regeneration, can be effected except in man's freedom, casts himself into mere shades, and consequently into grave errors. For he supposes that if the Lord 
wills, He can save everyone, and this by means innumerable-as by miracles, by the dead rising again, by immediate revelations, by the angels withholding men from evil and impelling them to good by 
an open strong force, and by means of many states, on being led into which a man performs repentance, and by many other means.  [3] But he does not know that all these means are compulsory, and that 
no man can possibly be reformed thereby. For whatever compels a man does not impart to him any affection; or if it is of such a nature as to do this, it allies itself with the affection of evil. For it 
appears to infuse something holy, and even does so; but when the man's state is changed, he returns to his former affections, namely, evils and falsities, and then that holy thing conjoins itself with 
the evils and falsities, and becomes profane, and is then of such a nature as to lead into the most grievous hell of all. For the man first acknowledges and believes, and is also affected with what 
is holy, and then denies, and even holds it in aversion. (That they who once acknowledge at heart, and afterwards deny, are those who profane, but not they who have not acknowledged at heart, may be 
seen above, n. 301-303, 571, 582, 593, 1001, 1008, 1010, 1059, 1327, 1328, 2051, 2426, 3398, 3399, 3402, 3898.) For this reason open miracles are not wrought at the present day, but miracles not open, 
or not conspicuous; which are such as not to inspire a sense of holiness, or take away man's freedom; and therefore the dead do not rise again, and man is not withheld from evils by immediate revelations, 
or by angels, or moved to good by open force.  [4] Man's freedom is what the Lord works in, and by which he bends him; for all freedom is of his love or affection, and therefore of his will (n. 
3158). If a man does not receive good and truth in freedom, it cannot be appropriated to him, or become his. For that to which anyone is compelled is not his, but belongs to him who compels, because 
although it is done by him, he does not do it of himself. It sometimes appears as if man were compelled to good, as in temptations and spiritual combats; but that he has then a stronger freedom than at 
other times, may be seen above (n. 1937, 1947, 2881). It also appears as if man were compelled to good, when he compels himself to it; but it is one thing to compel one's self, and another to be compelled. 
When anyone compels himself, he does so from a freedom within; but to be compelled is not from freedom. This being the case, it is evident into what shades, and thus into what errors, those are 
able to cast themselves who reason concerning the Providence of the Lord, the salvation of man, and the damnation of many, and yet do not know that it is freedom by which the Lord works, and by no means 
compulsion; for compulsion in things of a holy nature is dangerous, unless it is received in freedom. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4031</b></p><p><b>4031.</b>
'And before [the eyes of those of] the flock which came together later he did not put [the rods] in' means things that are compulsory. This is clear from the meaning of 'coming together later'. 'Coming 
together first' means, as shown above in <a href="4029.htm">4029</a>, that which is spontaneous or free; and from this, as well as from the sequence of thought in the internal sense, it is evident that 'coming together later' 
means that which is compulsory or non-free. It is also evident from the consideration that the expression 'coming on heat' is not used here as it is of those which came together first. For 'coming 
on heat' means affection, in this case an intense desire. Anything that does not begin from affection is not spontaneous or free, for everything spontaneous or free is in keeping with one's affection 
or love, <a href="2870.htm">2870</a>. This consideration is also evident from the derivation of the expression in the original language as a lack, for if the intense desire is lacking, all sense of freedom is at an end, 
in which case that which a pervert does is referred to as non-freedom and at length that which is compulsory. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It may be seen from the paragraphs quoted above in <a href="4029.htm">4029</a> that every joining together 
of truth and good, and therefore all reformation and regeneration, is effected in freedom, that is, is the outcome of what is spontaneous. Consequently no joining together of truth and good, thus no 
regeneration, is possible in the absence of freedom, that is, through compulsion. What freedom is, and the origin of it, see <a href="2870.htm">2870</a>-<a href="2893.htm">2893</a>, where Human Freedom is the subject. Anyone who is unaware of the 
fact that no joining of truth and good, that is, no making of these one's own, and so no regeneration, is possible except in a person's freedom, ends up - if he reasons about the Lord's Providence, about 
human salvation, and about the eternal damnation of many - with utterly dim misconceptions and then with serious errors. For he imagines that if the Lord is willing, He is able to save anyone, and 
to do so by all manner of means beyond number - by miracles, by the dead coming back again, by direct revelations, by angels withholding people from evils, and driving them to good by the plain use 
of force, and by many states into which a person is introduced and becomes repentant, and by many other means. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But he does not know that all of these means involve compulsion and that nobody can 
be reformed through them. For anything that compels a person does not impart any affection to him; or if it is of such a nature that it does impart an affection, it binds itself to an affection for 
evil. Indeed it seems to instill, and does in fact instill, some holiness, but even so, when the state is altered he goes back to his previous affections, which are evils and falsities. In that case that 
holiness links itself to the evils and falsities and is turned into profanity, such as leads him into the worst hell of all. For that person first of all acknowledges and believes, and also has an 
affection for what is holy; but after that he denies it, indeed he loathes it. For profaners are those who at one point acknowledge with the heart and after that deny, not those who have not acknowledged 
with the heart, see <a href="301.htm">301</a>-<a href="303.htm">303</a>, <a href="571.htm">571</a>, <a href="582.htm">582</a>, <a href="593.htm">593</a>, <a href="1001.htm">1001</a>, <a href="1008.htm">1008</a>, <a href="1010.htm">1010</a>, <a href="1059.htm">1059</a>, <a href="1327.htm">1327</a>, <a href="1328.htm">1328</a>, <a href="2051.htm">2051</a>, <a href="2426.htm">2426</a>, <a href="3398.htm">3398</a>, <a href="3399.htm">3399</a>, <a href="3402.htm">3402</a>, <a href="3898.htm">3898</a>. For this reason evident miracles do not take place at the present day, only miracles 
which are not evident or plain to see and which are of such a nature that they do not enforce any holiness or take away a person's freedom from him. This is why the dead do not come back again and 
why no one is withheld from evil by direct revelations, or by angels, and led to good by the plain use of force. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 It is man's freedom into which the Lord operates, and by means of which He turns 
him in a different direction. For all freedom involves that which is present in his love or affection, and so in his will, <a href="3158.htm">3158</a>. If he does not receive good and truth in freedom it cannot be made 
or become his own, since that which is for him compulsory is not his own but belongs to whoever compels it. For he is not acting of himself even though the action is done by him. It does sometimes seem 
as though a person is drawn under compulsion towards good, as in temptations and spiritual conflicts. But within these experiences he is in greater freedom than when he is outside them, see <a href="1937.htm">1937</a>, <a href="1947.htm">1947</a>, <a href="2881.htm">2881</a>. It also seems as though a person is acting under compulsion when he compels himself to do good; but self-compulsion is one thing, being compelled is another. Self-compulsion with anyone is a 
product of the freedom within him, but being compelled is a product of non-freedom. This shows what dim misconceptions and then what errors people end up with who reason about the Lord's Providence, 
about human salvation, and about the eternal damnation of many, yet who are unaware of the fact that it is freedom through which the Lord operates and by no means through compulsion. For compulsion in 
things of a holy nature if not freely accepted is dangerous. </p>

`Et ad dein coire gregem non posuit': quod significet coacta, constat ex significatione `dein coire'; quod primum coire sit spontaneum, seu liberum, supra n. 4029 ostensum est; quod `dein coire' 
sit coactum seu non liberum, inde et quoque a nexu rerum in sensu interno patet; ut et ex eo quod hic non incalescere ut de primum coeuntibus dicatur, per `incalescere' enim significatur affectio, 
et ibi affectionis ardor; quodcumque non (t)est ex affectione, est ex non spontaneo seu non libero, nam omne spontaneum seu liberum est affectionis seu amoris, n. 2870; patet quoque ex derivatione

ita nulla regeneratio fieri possit; quid liberum et unde liberum, videatur n. 2870-2893, ubi de libero hominis actum est: qui non novit quod nulla conjunctio veri et boni, hoc est, appropriatio, 
ita quod nulla regeneratio, fieri possit nisi in libero hominis, is dum ratiocinatur de Providentia Domini, de salvatione hominis, et de plurium damnatione, in meras umbras, et inde in graves 
errores se conjicit; putat enim quod si Dominus velit, salvare possit unumquemvis, et hoc per innumerabilia media, sicut per miracula, per mortuos qui resurgent, per revelationes immediatas, per angelos 
qui a malis detinebunt, et ad bonum vi forti manifesta impellent, perque status plures in quos cum inducitur homo, paenitentiam agat, et perplura alia; sed non novit quod omnia haec media coacta 
sint, et quod per illa homo reformari nequeat, nam quicquid cogit hominem, hoc non indit ei aliquam affectionem, et si tale sit ut indat, alligat se affectioni mali; apparet enim sicut aliquod 
sanctum infundat, etiam infundit, sed usque cum (t)status mutatur, ad affectiones suas priores, nempe mala et falsa, redit, et tunc sanctum illud se conjungit cum malis et falsis et fit profanum, quod 
tale est ut inducat in infernum omnium gravissimum; agnoscit enim primum et credit, et quoque sancto afficitur, et dein negat, immo aversatur; quod qui {2}semel agnoscunt corde et dein negant,

<p>inde hodie manifesta miracula non

voluntatis ejus, n. 3158; si non recipit bonum et verum in libero, non potest appropriari ei, seu fieri ejus; id enim ad quod cogitur{4}, non est ejus, sed est illius qui cogit, nam non facit 
(c)ex se, tametsi fit per se; apparet quandoque quasi homo ad bonum cogatur, sicut in tentationibus {5}et pugnis spiritualibus, sed quod tunc ei fortius liberum sit quam extra illas, videatur n.
