<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8141.</strong>出埃及记14:5-9.有人告诉埃及王，百姓逃跑！法老和他的臣仆就向百姓变心，说，我们容以色列走，不再服事我们，我们这是作的什么事呢？法老就套上他的战车，带领百姓与他同去。他带着六百辆特选的战车和埃及所有的战车，他们都有三级兵长。耶和华使埃及王法老的心刚硬，他就追袭以色列人，以色列人却以高举的手出来了。埃及人追袭他们，法老一切的战车马匹、马兵与军队，就在靠近比哈希录、巴力洗分前面，在海边安营的地方追上他们。<br />“有人告诉埃及王，百姓逃跑”表那些沉浸于邪恶所生的纯粹虚假之人的思维，即他们被完全分离了。“法老和他的臣仆就向百姓变心”表一种状态的改变，即进入那些沉浸于邪恶所生的虚假之人里面的邪恶的一种改变。“说，我们这是作的什么事呢”表自责。“我们容以色列走，不再服事我们”表他们离开他们，没有征服或掌控他们。“法老就套上他的战车”表一般属于分离之信的虚假教义。“带领百姓与他同去”表与每一个并一切虚假一起。“他带着六百辆特选的战车”表在自己秩序中的、支持属于分离之信的虚假的一切和每个教义事物。“和埃及所有的战车”表以及支持从属于它们的虚假的教义事物。“他们都有三级兵长”表已经在总体之下被排列成秩序。“耶和华使埃及王法老的心刚硬”表来自邪恶所产生的虚假的顽固反对。“他就追袭以色列人”表企图征服或掌控那些处于与仁结合之信的人。“以色列人却以高举的手出来了”表尽管他们已经被神的大能从征服或掌控他们的企图中释放出来。“埃及人追袭他们”表由那些沉浸于邪恶所生的虚假之人企图征服或掌控他们所导致的行为。“在海边安营的地方追上他们”表在邪恶所生的虚假存在的地狱区域周围的交流。“法老一切的战车马匹、马兵与军队”表构成属于一种败坏理解力的虚假的一切。“就在靠近比哈希录、巴力洗分前面”表交流的源头，由此经历试探的状态的开始。</p>

Verses 5-9. And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, What is this we have done, that we have 
let Israel go from serving us? And he harnessed his chariot, and took his people with him; and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and tertian captains upon all of them. 
And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the sons of Israel; and the sons of Israel went out with a lofty hand. And the Egyptians pursued after them, and overtook 
them encamping by the sea, all the horses of the chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon. "And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled," 
signifies the thought of those who were in mere falsities from evil, that they were completely separated; "and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people," signifies a change 
of state into evil in the case of those who were in falsities from evil; "and they said, What is this we have done?" signifies chiding; "that we have let Israel go from serving us," signifies that 
they have left and have not subjugated them; "and he harnessed his chariot," signifies the doctrine of falsity, which is that of faith separate in general; "and took his people with him," signifies 
with all falsities both in general and in particular; "and he took six hundred chosen chariots," signifies all and each of the doctrinal things of falsity which are of faith separate in their order; "and 
all the chariots of Egypt," signifies also the doctrinal things of falsity that are of service to them; "and tertian captains upon all of them," signifies reduced into order under generals; "and Jehovah 
hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt," signifies obstinacy from the falsity which is from evil; "and he pursued after the sons of Israel," signifies an attempt to subjugate those who were 
in faith conjoined with charity; "and the sons of Israel went out with a lofty hand," signifies when nevertheless they had been released by the Divine power from the endeavor to subjugate them; "and 
the Egyptians pursued after them," signifies the effect from the endeavor to subjugate on the part of those who were in falsities from evil; "and overtook them encamping by the sea," signifies communication 
around the region of hell where are falsities from evil; "all the horses of the chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army," signifies all things which are of falsity from a perverted 
understanding; "beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon," signifies whence there was communication, and therefore the beginning of the state of undergoing temptations. </p>

Verses 5-9 And it was pointed out to the king of Egypt that the people had fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and his servants was turned against the people, and they said, What is this we have done, that 
we have sent Israel away from serving us? And he harnessed his chariot, and took his people with him. And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt; and there were tertiary 
commanders over them all.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued the children of Israel; and the children of Israel went out with a lofty hand. And the Egyptians pursued 
them; and they overtook them encamping close to the sea - all Pharaoh's chariot-horses, and his horsemen, and his army [did so], close to Pi Hahiroth before Baal Zephon. </p>
<p>'And it was pointed out 
to the king of Egypt that the people had fled' means the thought of those steeped in utter falsities arising from evil, that they had become entirely separated. 'And the heart of Pharaoh and his servants 
was turned against the people' means a change of state, a change to evil within those steeped in falsities arising from evil. 'And they said, What is this we have done' means [self-]reproach. 'That 
we have sent Israel away from serving us?' means that they had left them alone and not brought them under their control. 'And he harnessed his chariot' means doctrine championing falsity that belongs 
to separated faith in general. 'And took his people with him' means together with each and every falsity. 'And he took six hundred chosen chariots' means each and every doctrinal teaching that upholds 
falsity belonging to separated faith, in their own order. 'And all the chariots of Egypt' means also doctrinal teachings upholding falsity that were subservient to these. 'And there were tertiary 
commanders over them all' means having been arranged into order under general headings. 'And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt' means obstinate opposition from the falsity that arose 
from evil. 'And he pursued the children of Israel' means the attempt to bring under his control those governed by faith bonded to charity. 'And the children of Israel went out with a lofty hand' means 
although they had been rescued by God's power from their attempt to bring them under their control. 'And the Egyptians pursued them' means action resulting from the attempt of those steeped in falsities 
arising from evil to bring them under their control. 'And they overtook them encamping close to the sea' means communication around the region of hell where falsities arising from evil are present. 
'All Pharaoh's chariot-horses, and his horsemen, and his army' means everything composing the falsity belonging to a perverted understanding. 'Close to Pi Hahiroth before Baal Zephon' means the source 
of communication, and from this the beginning of the state for undergoing temptations.

Vers. 5-9.  Et indicatum regi Aegypti quod fugeret populus; et conversum est cor Pharaonis et servorum illius contra populum, et dixerunt, Quid hoc fecimus, quod dimiserimus Israelem a serviendo nobis? 
 Et alligavit currum suum, et populum suum sumpsit secum.  Et sumpsit sescentos currus electos, et omnes currus Aegypti; et tertiani duces super omnes (x)illius.  Et induravit Jehovah cor Pharaonis 
regis Aegypti, et persecutus post filios Israelis; et filii Israelis exeuntes manu excelsa.  Et persecuti Aegyptii post illos, et assecuti illos castrametantes juxta mare, omnes equi curruum Pharaonis, 
et equites illius, et exercitus illius, juxta Pi-Chiroth ante Baal-Zephon.  `Et indicatum regi Aegypti quod fugeret populus' significat cogitationem illorum qui in meris falsis ex malo quod separarentur 
prorsus: `et conversum est cor Pharaonis et servorum illius contra populum' significat mutationem status in malum penes illos qui in falsis (c)ex malo: `et dixerunt, Quid hoc fecimus' significat 
increpationem [,nempe sui]: `quod dimiserimus Israelem a serviendo nobis?' significat quod reliquerint et non subjugaverint: `et alligavit currum suum' significat doctrinam falsi quae fidei separatae 
in genere: `et populum suum sumpsit secum' significat cum omnibus et singulis falsis: `et sumpsit sescentos currus electos' significat omnia et singula doctrinalia falsi quae fidei separatae in suo 
ordine: `et omnes currus Aegypti' significat etiam doctrinalia falsi servientia illis: `et tertiani duces super omnes illius' significat sub communibus in ordinem redacta:  `et induravit Jehovah cor Pharaonis 
regis Aegypti' significat obstinationem ex falso quod ex malo: `et (x)persecutus post filios Israelis' significat conatum subjugandi illos qui in fide conjuncta charitati: `et filii Israelis 
exeuntes manu excelsa' significat cum tamen exempti ab eorum subjugationis conatu ex potentia Divina: `et persecuti Aegyptii post illos' significat effectum ex conatu subjugationis illorum qui in falsis 
a malo: `et assecuti illos castrametantes juxta mare' significat communicationem circa regionem inferni ubi falsa ex malo: `omnes equi curruum Pharaonis, et equites (c)illius, et exercitus illius' 
significat {1}omnia quae falsi ex intellectuali perverso: `juxta Pi-Chiroth ante Baal-Zephon' significat unde communicatio, et inde principium status subeundi tentationes. 	@1 illa but n. 8156 d illa i omnia$ </p>
