<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>519.</strong>那时有这样一些人，他们从上古教会及后续教会所直觉的事物中构建教义，以这些教义为准绳来认识何为善与真。这种人被称为“以诺”。“以诺与神同行”便是此意；他们也这样称呼其教义；因为“以诺”表教导，的确是这个意思。从“行”（walking）这个词的含义，以及他被说成“与神”同行，而不是“与耶和华同行”的事实同样明显看出这一点：“与神同行”是指依照信的教义来教导和生活；“与耶和华同行”则指活出爱的生活。“行”是用来表示“生活”的常见表达形式，正如“行在律法中”、“行在律例中”、“行在真理中”。准确地说，“行”是指关乎真理，因而关乎信或信之教义的路。从下列经文可在某种程度上明白“行”（walking）在圣言中的意义。<br />②在弥迦书：<br />世人哪，耶和华已指示你何为善，他向你所要的是什么呢？只要你行公义，好怜悯，存谦卑的心，与你的神同行。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥6.8.htm">6:8</a>）<br />这里的“与神同行”表示依照指示而生活，然而，此处说到“与神”（with God）所用的词，与论到以诺时表示“与神”（from with God）所用的词不同，这种表述容易引起歧义。诗篇：<br />你救护我的脚不跌倒，使我在生命的光中行在神面前。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗56.13.htm">56:13</a>）<br />“行在神面前”就是行在信的真理中，这真理就是“生命的光”。同样在以赛亚书：<br />在黑暗中行走的百姓看见了大光。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.2.htm">9:2</a>）<br />所以主藉着摩西说：<br />我要在你们中间行走，作你们的神，你们要作我的子民。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.12.htm">26:12</a>）<br />这表示他们当照律法的教导生活。<br />③耶利米书：<br />他们要将它们（骸骨）抛散在日头、月亮和天上众星之下，就是他们从前所喜爱、所侍奉、所随从、所求问的。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶8.2.htm">8:2</a>）<br />在此对爱的事物和信的事物作了明显区分；爱的事物用“喜爱和侍奉”来表述，信的事物则用“随从和求问”来表述。所有先知书中的用词精准，不能随意用其它词替代。但在圣言中，“与耶和华同行”或“在耶和华面前”表活出仁爱的生活。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]519.</strong> There were at that time people who developed a theology out of the things perceived by the earliest church and the churches that followed. They designed it to serve as a standard by which everyone could judge what was good and true. The people who did this were called Enoch, and what they did was symbolized by the words and Enoch walked with God. They also used the name for the theology or set of teachings itself, which is what the name Enoch — "teach" — means.{*1} Additional evidence for this signification is the symbolism of the word walk and the fact that he is said to have walked with God, not with Jehovah. Walking with God is teaching the doctrine concerning faith and living by it, while walking with Jehovah is living a life of love.<br />Walk is a figure of speech for living, in such phrases as walk in the law, walk in the statutes, and walk in truth.{*2} At its most basic level, walking has to do with a path, and a path relates to truth and consequently to faith, or to the doctrine concerning faith.<br />[2] What walking symbolizes in the Word can be established to some extent from the following passages. In Micah:<br />He has pointed out to you, friend, what is good; and what is Jehovah requiring of you but to carry out judgment and the love of mercy and to be humble walking with your God? (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_519/bible_king-james-version_micah_6_8" target=_top>Micah 6:8</a>)<br />Walking with God here too symbolizes living — living by the things "pointed out." The expression with God appears, but the same phrase in regard to Enoch employs a different [Hebrew] word, one that can also mean from beside (God); so it is ambiguous.{*3} In David:<br />You rescued my feet from tripping, to walk before God in the light of the living. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_519/bible_king-james-version_psalms_56_13" target=_top>Psalms 56:13</a>)<br />Walking before God means walking in religious truth — the "light of the living." Likewise in Isaiah:<br />The people walking in darkness now see great light. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_519/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_9_2" target=_top>Isaiah 9:2</a>)<br />The Lord says in Moses:<br />I will walk in your midst and become your God, and you will become my people. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_519/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_26_12" target=_top>Leviticus 26:12</a>)<br />This stands for the idea that they would live according to the teachings of the law.<br />[3] In Jeremiah:<br />They will spread them out to the sun and to the moon and to the armies of the heavens — those that they loved, and that they served, and that they walked after, and that they sought. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_519/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_8_2" target=_top>Jeremiah 8:2</a>)<br />A clear distinction is being made here between the activity of love and the activity of faith. That of love is loving and serving; that of faith is walking and seeking. The prophets pay close attention to words and never replace one word with another.<br />Walking with or before Jehovah, on the other hand, when it comes up in the Word, means living a life of love.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the name Enoch see note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_519/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_401" target=_top>401</a>.

There were some at that time who framed doctrines from the things that had been matters of perception in the most ancient and succeeding churches, in order that such doctrine might serve as a rule whereby 
to know what was good and true: such persons were called "Enoch." This is what is signified by the words, "and Enoch walked with God;" and so did they call that doctrine; which is likewise signified 
by the name "Enoch" which means to "instruct." The same is evident also from the signification of the expression to "walk" and from the fact that he is said to have "walked with God" not "with Jehovah:" 
to "walk with God" is to teach and live according to the doctrine of faith, but to "walk with Jehovah" is to live the life of love. To "walk" is a customary form of speaking that signifies to 
live, as to "walk in the law" to "walk in the statutes" to "walk in the truth." To "walk" has reference properly to a way, which has relation to truth, consequently to faith, or the doctrine of faith. 
What is signified in the Word by "walking" may in some measure appear from the following passages.  [2] In Micah: </p>
<p>     He hath showed thee, O man, what is good, and what doth Jehovah require of thee, 
but to do judgment and the love of mercy, and to humble thyself by walking with thy God? (Micah 6:8), where to "walk with God" signifies to live according to the things here indicated; here, however, 
it is said "with God" while of Enoch another word is used which signifies also "from with God" so that the expression is ambiguous. In David: </p>
<p>     Thou hast delivered my feet from impulsion, that 
I may walk before God in the light of the living (Ps. 56:13),      where to "walk before God" is to walk in the truth of faith, which is the "light of the living." In like manner in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The 
people that walk in darkness see a great light (Isa. 9:1).  So the Lord says by Moses: </p>
<p>     I will walk in the midst, and will be your God, and ye shall be My people (Lev. 26:12), signifying that 
they should live according to the doctrine of the law.  [3] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     They shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and to the armies of the heavens, whom they have loved, and whom they 
have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought (Jer. 8:2),  where a manifest distinction is made between the things of love, and those of faith; the things of love being 
expressed by "loving" and "serving;" and those of faith by "walking" and "seeking." In all the prophetical writings every expression is used with accuracy, nor is one term ever used in the place of another. 
But to "walk with Jehovah" or "before Jehovah" signifies, in the Word, to live the life of love. </p>

At that time there were people who formulated doctrine out of what had been matters of perception in the Most Ancient Church and in the Churches that came after it, and this doctrine was to serve as 
a yardstick by which people could recognize what good and truth were. Such people were called 'Enoch', and this is meant by these words, 'and Enoch walked with God'. They also applied this name to that 
doctrine of theirs, for this indeed was meant by the name Enoch, which is 'instructing'. The matter is also clear from the meaning of the expression walking' and from the fact that he is said to have 
walked, not with Jehovah, but 'with God'. 'Walking with God' is teaching and living according to the doctrine of faith, whereas 'walking with Jehovah' is leading a life of love. 'Walking' is a customary 
expression to mean living, as in the phrases walking in the law, walking in statutes, walking in the truth. Strictly speaking, walking has regard to the path of truth, and therefore of faith or the 
doctrine of faith. From the places that are quoted below it becomes to some extent clear what 'walking' means in the Word.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In Micah,  </p>
<blockquote>
He has shown you, O man, what is good; and what does 
Jehovah require of you but to carry out judgement and the love of mercy, and to humble yourself by walking with your God? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Micah%206:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Micah 6:8</a>.   
</blockquote>
Here too 'walking with God' means living according to the requirements 
set out here. But although the expression 'with God' is used here the preposition employed is different from the one used in reference to Enoch, which really means 'from with God', and so is 
a phrase which is ambiguous.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> In David,  </p>
<blockquote>
 You have delivered my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2056:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 56:13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'walking before God' is walking in the 
truth of faith, which is 'the light of the living'. Similarly in Isaiah,   The people walking in darkness see a great light. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%209:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 9:2</a>.  </p>
<p>In Moses the Lord says,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will walk in your midst and 
be your God, and you will be My people. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2026:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 26:11</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This stood for the requirement that they should live according to the teaching of the law.  </p>
<p>In Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
They will spread them<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> before the 
sun and the moon and all the hosts of heaven, which they have loved and which they have served, and which they have walked after, and which they have sought. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%208:2%20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 8:2 </a> 
</blockquote>
<p>A clear distinction is made 
here between the things that belong to love and those that belong to faith. Those that belong to love are referred to by 'loving and serving', those that belong to faith by 'walking and seeking after'. 
For in the Prophets careful attention is paid to the use of words; one word is nowhere used in place of another In the Word 'walking with Jehovah' or 'before Jehovah' means leading a life of love.

Fuerant illo tempore qui ex perceptivis Antiquissimae Ecclesiae et sequentium faciebant doctrinam ut serviret pro norma et sciretur inde quid bonum et verum; ii qui tales, vocati sunt 'Hanoch'; quod 
significatur per haec verba, 'et ambulavit sibi Hanoch cum Deo'; ita etiam vocabant illi doctrinam istam; quae significata quoque est per nomen Hanoch, quod est instruere: constat quoque ex significatione 
vocis 'ambulare,' et ex eo quod dicatur ambulavisse 'cum Deo,' non cum Jehovah; 'ambulare cum Deo' est docere et vivere secundum doctrinam fidei, at 'ambulare cum Jehovah' est vivere vitam amoris: 
ambulare est formula sollemnis significans vivere, sicut ambulare in lege, ambulare in statutis, ambulare in veritate: ambulare proprie spectat viam quae est veritatis, proinde quae est fidei seu doctrinae 
fidei: quid ambulare significat in Verbo, ex his quae sequuntur locis aliquantum constare potest; [2] apud Micham, 	Indicavit tibi, homo, quid bonum, et quid Jehovah requirens a te, nisi facere 
judicium et amorem {1} misericordiae, et humiliare se, ambulando cum Deo tuo? vi 8; </p>
<p>hic 'ambulare cum Deo' significat quoque vivere secundum illa quae indicata sunt; sed hic 'cum Deo' dicitur, sed 
de Hanocho alia vox, quae significat quoque a cum Deo, ita ut vox ambigua sit: apud Davidem, 	Eripuisti... pedes meos ab impulsione, ad ambulandum coram Deo in luce viventium, Ps. lvi 14 [A.V. 13]; </p>
<p>ubi 
'ambulare coram Deo' est in veritate fidei, quae est lux viventium: similiter apud Esaiam, 	Populus, ambulantes in tenebris, vident lucem magnam, ix 1[A.V.2]: </p>
<p>Dominus apud Mosen, 	Ambulabo in 
medio, et ero vobis in Deum, et vos eritis mihi in populum, Lev. xxvi 12; </p>
<p>pro ut viverent secundum doctrinam legis: [3] apud Jeremiam,           	Expandent ea ad solem et ad lunam, et ad exercitus 
caelorum, quae amaverunt, et quibus serviverunt, et post quae ambularunt, et quae quaesiverunt, viii 2; </p>
<p>hic manifeste distinguitur inter illa quae sunt amoris et quae sunt fidei; quae sunt amoris, sunt 
'amare et servire'; quae sunt fidei, sunt 'ambulare et quaerere'; apud Prophetas accurate voces observantur nec usquam una loco alterius sumitur.  Sed 'ambulare cum Jehovah' seu 'coram Jehovah' in 
Verbo significat vivere vitam amoris. @	1 This is Sch. translation. In n. 2180 and 10143 S. has amare misericordiam.$ </p>
