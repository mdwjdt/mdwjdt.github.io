<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10575节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10575</strong>.“祂说，我要使我的一切美善都在你面前经过”表使构成天堂和教会的一切神性都从与内在分离的外在（就是与摩西和他所领导的民族同在的外在）经过。这从“使……在他面前经过”和“耶和华的一切美善”的含义清楚可知：“使……在他面前经过”是指向与内在分离的外在，就是诸如与摩西和他所领导的民族同在的外在如此行，因为“你面（即脸）”表示敬拜、教会和圣言的敬拜的外在，这外在含有一个内在或内在实质，而“使……经过”表示使它经过这外在；“耶和华的一切美善”是指构成天堂和教会的一切神性。此处的情形从前面关于摩西和他所领导的民族的阐述和说明可以看出来，即：他们的兴趣在于与内在之物分离的外在事物，这意味着当进行敬拜时，他们只是执行表面的神圣行为，根本不思想任何内在事物。由于一种内在的神圣仍旧存在，尽管它并未进入这个民族的表面神圣，所以显而易见耶和华宣称“祂要使祂的一切美善在他面前经过”是什么意思。诚然，这个民族拥有心智的内在层面，但这内在由于爱自己爱世界而是肮脏的，充满污秽。然而，当他们进行敬拜时，这内在就被关闭，以防止天堂、教会和敬拜里面的神性遭到玷污。因为如果这神性被他们心智的内在玷污，那么当他们进行敬拜并阅读圣言时，与他们同在的外在之物与天堂根本不会有任何联系。关于这些问题，可参看前面的阐述和说明（<a href="10454.htm">10454</a>-<a href="10457.htm">10457</a>，<a href="10462.htm">10462</a>-<a href="10466.htm">10466</a>，<a href="10492.htm">10492</a>，<a href="10498.htm">10498</a>，<a href="10500.htm">10500</a>，<a href="10533.htm">10533</a>，<a href="10549.htm">10549</a>-<a href="10551.htm">10551</a>，<a href="10570.htm">10570</a>节），那里充分解释这些事。</p>

And He said, I will make all My good pass by over thy faces. That this signifies all the Divine of heaven and of the church above the external separate from the internal, in which external were Moses 
and the nation over which he presided, is evident from the signification of "making pass by over his faces," as being above the external separate from the internal in which were Moses and the nation 
over which he presided, for by "thy faces" is signified the external of worship, of the church, and of the Word, in which there is an internal, and by "making pass by" is signified above it; and from 
the signification of "all the good of Jehovah" as being all the Divine of heaven and of the church. How the case herein is can be seen from what has been said and shown above concerning Moses and the 
nation over which he presided, namely, that they were in external things separate from what is internal, by which is meant that while in worship they were in holy external things without anything internal; 
and as there was nevertheless present a holy internal, but which did not enter into their holy external, it is therefore plain what is signified by "Jehovah making all His good to pass by over his 
faces." There was indeed an internal in that nation, but it was filthy and full of uncleanness from the love of self and of the world. This, however, was closed when they were in worship, to the end 
that the internal Divine of heaven, of the church, and of the Word should not be defiled; for if this had been defiled by the internal of that nation, there would have been no communication whatever 
of their external with heaven while they were engaged in worship and in reading the Word (on which subject see what has been said and shown in n. 10454-10457, 10462-10466, 10492, 10498, 10500, 10533, 
10549-10551, 10570, where these things have been more fully unfolded). </p>

'And He said, I will cause all My goodness to pass by your face' means causing everything Divine which composes heaven and the Church to pass by the external separated from the internal as it existed 
with Moses and the nation he headed. This is clear from the meaning of 'causing to pass by his face' as doing so to the external separated from the internal as it existed with Moses and the nation he 
headed, for 'your face' means the outward form that worship, the Church, and the Word take, which has an inner substance, while 'causing to pass' means making it pass by this; and from the meaning of 
'all the goodness of Jehovah' as everything Divine composing heaven and the Church. The implications of all this may be recognized from what has been stated and shown above regarding Moses and the nation 
he headed. There it has been shown that their interest lay in external things separated from what was internal, by which is meant that when engaged in worship they performed outwardly holy acts without 
thought of anything internal. And since an inner holiness was nevertheless present, though it did not enter into that nation's outward holiness, it is evident what the meaning is of Jehovah's declaration 
that He would cause all His goodness to pass by his face. That nation did have, it is true, an internal level of mind, but this was foul, full of uncleanness as a result of self-love and love 
of the world. It was closed however when they engaged in worship, to prevent the defilement of what was within, belonging to heaven, the Church, and the Word. For if this had been defiled by their 
internal level of mind that which was external with them would not have had any connection at all with heaven when they engaged in worship and read the Word. See what has been stated and shown previously 
regarding these matters, in <a href="10454.htm">10454</a>-<a href="10457.htm">10457</a>, <a href="10462.htm">10462</a>-<a href="10466.htm">10466</a>, <a href="10492.htm">10492</a>, <a href="10498.htm">10498</a>, <a href="10500.htm">10500</a>, <a href="10533.htm">10533</a>, <a href="10549.htm">10549</a>-<a href="10551.htm">10551</a>, <a href="10570.htm">10570</a>, where they have been explained fully.  </p>

`Et dixit, Ego pertransire faciam omne bonum Meum super facies tuas': quod significet Omne Divinum caeli et Ecclesiae super externum separatum ab interno, in quo Moscheh et gens tui praeerat, constat 
ex significatione `pertransire facere super facies ejus' quod sit super externum separatum ab interno, in quo Mosche et gens tui praeerat, nam per `facies tuas' significatur externum cultus, Ecclesiae, 
et Verbi, in quo {1}internum, et per `(x)pertransire facere' significatur super id; et ex significatione `omnis boni Jehovae' quod sit omne Divinum caeli et Ecclesiae. Quomodo cum his se habet, constare 
potest ex illis quae supra de Mosche et de gente cui praeerat, dicta et ostensa sunt, quod nempe in externis separatis ab interno essent; per quod intelligitur quod in externis sanctis {2}absque 
interno essent cum in cultu, {3}et quia usque sanctum internum aderat, sed non intrabat in sanctum externum eorum; inde patet quid significatur per quod Jehovah pertransire faceret omne bonum super 
facies {4}ejus; fuit quidem (t)isti genti internum, sed hoc erat foedum, plenum immunditie ex amore sui et mundi; verum hoc clausum fuit cum in cultu erant, ex causa ne Divinum internum caeli, Ecclesiae, 
et Verbi conspurcaretur; nam si id per internum eorum conspurcaretur, nulla prorsus communicatio {5}externi eorum fuisset cum caelo quando in cultu et in lectione Verbi, de {6}qua re videantur quae
