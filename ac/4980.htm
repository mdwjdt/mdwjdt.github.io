<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4980节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4980.</strong>“耶和华就因约瑟的缘故赐福与那埃及人的家”表此时神性将属天-属世层赋予那真理。这从“赐福”和“埃及人的家”的含义清楚可知：“赐福”是指富有属天和属灵的良善，因此“耶和华赐福”表示神性的赋予；“埃及人的家”是指属世心智的良善，如前所述（<a href="4973.htm">4973</a>节）。由此可知，“耶和华赐福与那埃及人的家”表示这时神性将属天-属世层赋予那真理。属天-属世层是指与理性层的良善相对应，也就是与“约瑟”所表示的来自理性层的属灵层的属天层相对应的属世层里面的良善（<a href="4963.htm">4963</a>节）。<br />和属灵层一样，属天层既涉及理性层，也涉及属世层，也就是说，既涉及内在人，即理性人，也涉及外在人，即属世人。因为就其本质而言，属灵层是从主发出的神性真理，属天层是这神性真理里面的神性良善。当包含神性良善的神性真理被理性人或内在人接受时，它就被称为理性层中的属灵层；当被属世人或外在人接受时，它被称为属世层中的属灵层。同样，当存在于神性真理里面的神性良善理性人或内在人接受时，它被称为理性层中的属天层；当被属世人或外在人接受时，它被称为属世层中的属天层。对人来说，这二者既直接从主流入，也间接经由天使和灵人流入；但对主来说，当祂在世间时，它们从祂自己流入，因为神性存在于祂里面。</p>

That Jehovah blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake. That this signifies that from the Divine it then had the celestial natural, is evident from the signification of "being blessed," as being 
to be enriched with celestial and spiritual good, and that it was from the Divine is signified by its being said that "Jehovah blessed;" and from the signification of the "Egyptian's house," as being 
the good of the natural mind (as above, n. 4973). Hence it follows that by "Jehovah blessed the Egyptian's house" is signified that from the Divine it then had the celestial natural. The celestial natural 
is the good in the natural which corresponds to the good of the rational, that is, which corresponds to the celestial of the spiritual from the rational, which is "Joseph" (n. 4963). [2] The celestial 
as well as the spiritual is predicated of both the rational and the natural, that is, of the internal man, which is the rational man, and of the external, which is the natural man; for in its 
essence the spiritual is the Divine truth which proceeds from the Lord, and the celestial is the Divine good which is in this Divine truth. When Divine truth in which is Divine good is received by the 
rational or internal man, it is called the spiritual in the rational; and when received by the natural or external man, it is called the spiritual in the natural. In like manner when the Divine good 
which is in Divine truth is received by the rational or internal man, it is called the celestial in the rational; and when received by the natural or external man, it is called the celestial in the natural. 
Both flow in with man from the Lord immediately, as well as mediately through angels and spirits; but with the Lord when He was in the world, the inflow was from Himself, because the Divine was in Him. </p>

That Jehovah blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake' means that at this point the Divine imparted the celestial-natural to that truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'being blessed' as being 
enriched with celestial and spiritual good, so that an imparting by the Divine is meant by 'Jehovah blessed'; and from the meaning of 'the Egyptian's house' as the good dwelling in the natural mind, 
as above in <a href="4973.htm">4973</a>. From this it follows that the words 'Jehovah blessed the Egyptian's house' mean that at this point the Divine imparted the celestial-natural to it. The celestial-natural is good present 
in the natural which corresponds to the good belonging to the rational, that is, which corresponds to the celestial of the spiritual from the rational, meant by 'Joseph', <a href="4963.htm">4963</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The term celestial, 
like spiritual, is used in reference both to the rational and to the natural, that is, both to the internal man, which is the rational man, and to the external, which is the natural man. For 
essentially, the spiritual is Divine Truth which goes forth from the Lord, while the celestial is Divine Good present within that Divine Truth. When Divine Truth containing Divine Good is received by 
the rational, or by the internal man, it is called the spiritual within the rational, but when it is received by the natural, or by the external man, it is called the spiritual within the natural. The 
same is so with Divine Good present within Divine Truth. When this good is received by the rational, or by the internal man, it is referred to as the celestial within the rational, but when it is received 
by the natural, or by the external man, it is referred to as the celestial within the natural. In man's case these two flow in both directly from the Lord and indirectly from Him through angels 
and spirits; but in the Lord's case while He was in the world they flowed in from Himself because the Divine existed within Him. </p>

`Et benedixit Jehovah domui Aegyptii propter Josephum': </p>
<p>quod significet quod ex Divino tunc ei caeleste naturale, constat ex significatione `benedici' quod sit locupletari bono caelesti et spirituali; 
quod ex Divino, significatur per `benedixit Jehovah'; </p>
<p>et ex significatione `domus Aegyptii' quod sit bonum mentis naturalis, ut supra n. 4973; in sequitur quod per `benedixit Jehovah domui Aegyptii' 
significetur quod ex Divino tunc ei caeleste naturale. Caeleste naturale est bonum in naturali quod correspondet bono rationalis, hoc est, quod correspondet caelesti spiritualis e rationali, 
quod est `Josephus', n. 4963.  [2] Caeleste sicut {1} spirituale praedicatur et de rationale et de naturali, hoc est de interno homine qui est rationalis homo, et de externo qui est naturalis homo; 
spirituale enim in sua essentia est Divinum Verum quod procedit a Domino, et caeleste est Divinum Bonum quod est in Divino illo Vero; Divinum Verum in quo Divinum Bonum cum recipitur a rationali 
seu ab interno homine, dicitur spirituale in rationali, et cum recipitur a naturali seu ab externo homine, dicitur spirituale in naturali; Divinum Bonum quod est in Divino Vero, similiter; id cum 
recipitur a rationali seu interno homine, vocatur caeleste in rationali, et cum recipitur a naturali seu externo homine, vocatur caeleste in naturali; apud hominem influit utrumque a Domino tam immediate 
quam mediate per angelos et spiritus; at apud Dominum cum fuit in mundo, influebat ab Ipso quia Divinum fuit in Ipso. @1 i etiam$  </p>
