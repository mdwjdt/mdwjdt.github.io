<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7363节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7363.</strong>他们与我谈论了他们星球的居民如何生活。他们说，那里的人不受任何政权的控制；相反，他们被分成大大小小的社群，在这些社群中与性情相似的人来往。他们从别人的脸上和言语中立刻就知道他的心思是否与自己的一致，他们在这一点上很少弄错。然后，他们立刻成为朋友。不过，他们并不反感其他人，因为他们没有反感，更没有仇恨。他们还说，他们的交往令人快乐，他们彼此讨论他们社群里正在发生的事，尤其讨论天堂里正在发生的事；因为他们当中有许多人享有与天堂天使的公开接触。相信这一点并不难，因为他们具有这种性质，并且他们彼此交往的方式是这样：整个火星的所有社群合在一起代表一个总体的天使社群。那里的社群虽各不相同，但主通过天堂的形式将它们都联结起来，以构成一个整体；因为一个整体是由适合被排列成一个整体形式的各个部分构成的。</p>

They spoke with me about the life of the inhabitants in their earth, in that they are not under commands, but are distinguished into larger and smaller societies, and that they there associate with themselves 
such as agree with them in disposition. This they know at once from the face and speech, in which they are rarely deceived, and then they are forthwith friends. But they feel no aversion to 
others, for they have no aversion, still less hatred. They also said that their consociations are delightful, and that they converse together about what is being done in the societies, especially what 
is being done in heaven; for many of them have open communication with the angels in heaven. This is easy to believe, as they are of such a nature and so associated, that their societies, taken together 
through that earth, represent a general angelic society. The societies there are all various, but the Lord conjoins them all by the heavenly form, so as to be a one; for a one is made of various particulars 
suitably arranged into a form. </p>

They talked to me about the life of the inhabitants on their planet. They said that people there are not under the control of any regime; rather they are divided into individual communities, large and 
small, and in these they associate with the kind of people whose minds match their own. They know in an instant from another's face and speech whether his mind matches theirs, and in this they are rarely 
mistaken. Such people become friends in an instant; but they feel no aversion to everyone else, for there is no aversion, still less any hatred. They went on to say that their associations are delightful, 
and that they discuss with one another things that are happening in their communities, and especially those that are happening in heaven, since a large number of them enjoy open contact with 
the angels in heaven. One can also well believe this because they are such, and their manner of associating with one another is such, that all their communities throughout that planet taken together 
represent a general angelic community. For all the communities vary from one another, but the Lord links them all together by means of the heavenly form to make a single whole; for a single whole is 
made up of various parts properly assembled to produce the overall form. </p>

</p><b>7363.</b>
Locuti sunt mecum de vita incolarum in tellure sua, quod non sub imperiis sint, sed quod distincti in societates majores et minores, et quod ibi sibi consocient tales qui conveniunt animis; et quod 
hoc sciant ilico ex facie et loquela; quodque {1}id illos raro fallat; sunt tunc ilico amici; at ceteros non aversantur, nam nulla aversatio est, minus odium.  Dicebant quoque quod consociationes (c)illorum 
sint jucundae et quod inter se loquantur de iis rebus quae in societatibus fiunt, imprimis quae in caelo; nam plures illorum communicationem manifestam habent cum angelis qui in caelo.  Credibile 
etiam est, quia tales sunt, ac ita consociati, quod societates illorum simul sumptae per tellurem illam repraesentent societatem communem angelicam, nam societates ibi omnes variae sunt, sed Dominus 
conjungit omnes per caelestem formam ut unum sint; unum enim {2}fit ex variis in formam convenienter dispositis. 	@1 hoc$ 	@2 nusquam existit ex pluribus, unis seu iisdem, sed$ </p>
