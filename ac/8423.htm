<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8423节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8423.</strong>“是天天所收集的两倍”表这些良善将要被联结起来。这从“两倍”、“收集”和“天天”的含义清楚可知：“两倍”是指被联结起来，“两倍”之所以表示被联结起来，是因为“二”表示结合（参看<a href="1686.htm">1686</a>，<a href="3519.htm">3519</a>，<a href="5194.htm">5194</a>节）；“收集”是指领受（<a href="8418.htm">8418</a>节）；“天天”，也就是每一天，是指不断地（<a href="8418.htm">8418</a>节）。“二”之所以表示结合，是因为宇宙万物都与两样事物有关，即良善和真理，或也可说，爱和信；因为良善本质上是爱，真理本质上是信。也正因如此，人有两样事物构成他的生命，即意愿和理解力。人的意愿是为了领受良善或爱而形成的，理解力是为了领受真理或信而形成的。这二者的结合被称为一个“婚姻”，因为结合在起的这二者就像已婚的伴侣：它们彼此相爱、孕育并生产；它们的后代被称为果实。由此可见为何“二”或“两倍”表示结合，因为没有这二者的结合，无物可以诞生或产生。应该附带说明，由此可以清楚看出，信若无爱或仁，是无法产出任何果实的；这果实必是这二者结合在一起的产物。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8423</b></p><p><b>8423.</b>
And there shall be double over what they gather day by day. That this signifies that the goods are to be conjoined, is evident from the signification of "there being double," as being to be conjoined 
(that to be conjoined is signified by "double," is because "two" denotes conjunction, see n. 1686, 3519, 5194); from the signification of "gathering," as being to receive (n. 8418); and from the signification 
of "day by day," that is, on each day, as being continually (also n. 8418). That "two" denotes conjunction, is because there are two things to which all things in the universe bear relation, 
namely, good and truth, or what is the same, love and faith; for good is of love, and truth is of faith. Hence also there are two things with man which make his life, namely the will and understanding. 
The will with man has been formed to receive good or love, and the understanding to receive truth or faith. The conjunction of these two is called a "marriage," for these two when conjoined are circumstanced 
in like manner as are a married pair: they love each other; they conceive and bring forth; and the consequent offspring is called "fruit." From this it is now plain why "two" or "double" signifies 
conjunction, for without the conjunction of these two nothing is ever born or produced. It may be added that from all this it can be plainly seen that without love or charity faith can produce 
no fruit; but that fruit must be from the two conjoined. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8423</b></p><p><b>8423.</b>
'And it shall be double to what they shall gather day by day' means that they are to be joined together. This is clear from the meaning of 'being double' as being joined together, the reason why being 
joined together is meant by 'double' being that 'two' means conjunction, dealt with in <a href="1686.htm">1686</a>, <a href="3519.htm">3519</a>, <a href="5194.htm">5194</a>; from the meaning of 'gathering' as receiving, as above in <a href="8418.htm">8418</a>; and from the meaning of 'day 
by day', or every single day, as continually, as also above in <a href="8418.htm">8418</a>. The reason why 'two' means conjunction is that there are two realities to which everything that exists is related. Those two are goodness 
and truth, or what amounts to the same thing, love and faith since intrinsically good is love and truth is faith. Therefore also a person has two entities composing his life, namely will and understanding. 
A person's will has been fashioned to receive goodness or love, and his understanding to receive truth or faith. When the two are joined together it is called a marriage. For the two joined 
together resemble married partners, loving each other, conceiving and giving birth; and their offspring are called the fruit. From all these considerations one may now see why 'two' or 'double' means 
conjunction, for unless those two realities have been joined together nothing is ever born or produced. Let it be said in addition that those considerations prove plainly that faith without love or 
charity cannot produce any fruit; rather, fruit must be the product of both joined together. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 8423</b>
</p><b>8423.</b>
`Et erit duplum super quod colligent die die': quod significet quod conjungenda, constat (c)a significatione `esse duplum' quod sit conjungi; quod conjungi per duplum significetur, est quia `duo' sunt 
conjunctio, de qua n. 1686, 3519, 5194; et ex significatione `colligere' quod sit recipere, ut supra n. 8418; et ex significatione `die die' seu singulo die, quod sit jugiter, ut quoque supra n. 8418. 
 Quod `duo' sint conjunctio, est quia duo sunt ad quae omnia {1}se in universo referunt, nempe bonum et verum, seu quod idem, amor et fides, nam bonum est amoris et verum est fidei; inde quoque duo 
apud hominem sunt {2}quae faciunt vitam illius, nempe voluntas et intellectus, voluntas apud hominem formata est ad recipiendum bonum seu amorem, et intellectus ad recipiendum verum seu fidem; conjunctio 
duorum illorum vocatur conjugium, nam duo illa conjuncta (t)se similiter sicut conjuges habent, amant se mutuo, concipiunt et gignunt, proles inde vocatur fructus; ex his nunc patet cur `duo' seu 
`duplum' {3}significat conjunctionem, nam absque conjunctione duorum illorum nusquam aliquid nascitur seu producitur.  Adjicere licet quod ex his manifeste constare possit quod fides absque amore seu 
charitate nullum fructum possit producere, sed quod fructus erit ab utroque conjuncto. 	@1 After universo$ 	@2 ad quae omnia vitae ejus se referunt$ 	@3 significet$ </p>
