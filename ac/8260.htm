<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">内义</h4><br />8260.出埃及记15:1，2.那时，摩西和以色列人向耶和华唱这歌说，他们说，我要向耶和华歌唱，因祂高举自己；将马和骑马的投在海中。耶是我的力量、诗歌，也成了我的拯救。这是我的神，我要为祂预备一个住处；是我父亲的神，我要尊崇祂。<br />“那时，摩西和以色列人向耶和华唱这歌”表那些属于属灵教会的人因得释放而将荣耀归与主。“说，他们说”表由于流注。“我要向耶和华歌唱”表这荣耀唯独属于主。“因祂高举自己”表祂已经在祂的人性里面彰显了神性。“将马和骑马的投在海中”表仅仅因为祂的同在，邪恶所生的虚假就受到诅咒，并被投入地狱。“我的力量”表整个能力的源头是主自己。“耶是诗歌”表整个信和由此而来的荣耀的源头是来源于祂的神性真理。“也成了我的拯救”表拯救由此而来。“（这是我的神，）我要为祂预备一个住处”表在来源于祂自己的良善里面，祂就如同在祂的天堂里面。“是我父亲的神”表古代的教会没有别神。“我要尊崇祂”表现在神性敬拜也要献给祂。</p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE Verses 1, 2. Then sang Moses and the sons of Israel this song to Jehovah, and they said, saying, I will sing to Jehovah, because exalting He hath exalted; the horse and his rider 
hath He cast into the sea. My strength and song is Jah, and He hath been my salvation; this is my God, and I will prepare Him a habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt Him. "Then sang Moses and 
the sons of Israel this song to Jehovah," signifies a glorification of the Lord by those who are of the spiritual church, on account of liberation; "and they said, saying," signifies in this manner from 
influx; "I will sing to Jehovah," signifies that to the Lord alone is the glory; "because exalting He hath exalted," signifies that He has manifested His Divine in the Human; "the horse and his rider 
hath He cast into the sea," signifies in the fact that by His mere presence the falsities from evil were damned and cast into hell; "My strength," signifies that everything of power is from Him; "and 
song is Jah," signifies that everything of faith and of the consequent glory is from the Divine truth which is from Him; "and He hath been my salvation," signifies that salvation is from thence; "and 
I will prepare Him a habitation," signifies that in the good which is from Him, He shall be as in His heaven; "my father's God," signifies that there was no other Divine in the Ancient Churches; "and 
I will exalt Him," signifies that now also He has Divine worship. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE </p>
<p>Verses 1, 2 Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to Jehovah, and said - they said, I will sing to Jehovah, for He has highly exalted [Himself]; the horse and its 
rider He has thrown into the sea. My strength and song is Jah, and He has become my salvation. This is my God, and I will establish a dwelling-place for Him; my father's God, and I will exalt Him. </p>
<p>'Then 
Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to Jehovah' means that those belonging to the spiritual Church ascribed glory to the Lord because of their deliverance. 'And said - they said' means 
as a result of influx. 'I will sing to Jehovah' means that glory belongs to the Lord alone. 'For He has highly exalted [Himself]' means that He has displayed His Divinity within His Humanity. 'The 
horse and its rider He has thrown into the sea' means in that as a result simply of His presence falsities arising from evil have been damned and cast into hell. 'My strength' means that the source of 
the whole of power is the Lord Himself. 'And song is Jah' means that the source of the whole of faith and of the glory resulting from it is Divine Truth which originates in Him. 'And He has become my 
salvation' means that from this comes salvation. '[This is my God,] and I will establish a dwelling-place for Him' means that when He is within good, which originates in Himself, He will be as if in 
His heaven. 'My father's God' means that there was no other Deity in the ancient Churches. 'And I will exalt Him' means that now also will Divine worship be offered to Him. </p>

SENSUS INTERNUS </p>
<p>Vers. 1, 2.  Tunc cecinit Moscheh et filii Israelis canticum hoc Jehovae, et dixerunt dicendo, Cantabo Jehovae, quia exaltando exaltavit; equum et equitem ejus projecit in mare.  
Virtus mea, et canticum Jah, et fuit mihi ad salutem; Hic Deus meus, et habitaculum constituam Illi, Deus patris mei, et exaltabo Ipsum.  `Tunc cecinit Moscheh et filii Israelis canticum hoc Jehovae' 
significat glorificationem Domini ab illis qui ab Ecclesia spirituali propter liberationem: `et dixerunt dicendo' significat ita ex influxu: `(x)Cantabo Jehovae' significat quod Domino soli gloria: `quia 
exaltando exaltavit' significat quod manifestaverit Divinum Suum in Humano: `equum et equitem ejus projecit in mare' significat in eo quod ex sola praesentia Ipsius falsa ex malo damnata sint et conjecta 
in infernum: `virtus mea' significat quod omne potentiae ab Ipso: `et canticum Jah' significat quod omne fidei et inde gloriae sit ex Divino Vero quod ab Ipso: `et fuit mihi ad salutem' significat 
quod inde salvatio: `et habitaculum constituam Illi' significat quod in bono quod ab Ipso, erit ut in caelo Suo: `Deus patris mei' significat quod non aliud Divinum fuerit in Ecclesiis antiquis: 
`et exaltabo Ipsum' significat quod etiam nunc Ipsi cultus Divinus. </p>
