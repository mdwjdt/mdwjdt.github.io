<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10585节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>星空中的第四颗星球<br /><strong>10585</strong>.我没有像到其它星球那样被转到这个星球；相反，是来自这个星球的灵人自己被带到我这里。当距离尚远时，他们看上去就像长长的一卷，这卷不是连续的，而是由独立的部分组成；因为他们有很多人，分成了各个小组。一开始，他们朝较低部分钻去；如我所察觉的，他们从那里试图攀爬，从而到我这里来；但他们却不能。因此，他们继续前进，略微左转，直奔火星；他们从那里奋力上来，也做到了，尽管困难重重。这一切之所以必须以这种方式实现，是因为他们具有与我们星球的灵人完全不同的天性或性情；具有不同天性的人通过许多不同的途径被引领，好让实现联结所经由的灵人能与他们交往。因为将灵人和天使联结起来或分开的，是情感和思维；其情感和思维在何等程度上不同，他们就彼此分开到何等程度。但即便如此，当主乐意时，他们仍能通过中间灵人被联结起来。这就是为何这些灵人被径直带到火星。</p>

CONCERNING THE FOURTH EARTH IN THE STARRY HEAVEN.           To this earth, now to be described, I was not conveyed as to other earths; but the spirits themselves who were from that earth were brought 
to me. And when they were at a distance they were seen as a roll stretched out in length, not continuous, but in distinct parts; for there were many of them, and they were in companies. At first they 
were carried toward the lower parts, and it was perceived that they were trying to rise up from thence, and thus to come to me; but that they could not. Wherefore they proceeded a little to the left 
in front even to the earth Mars, and there they strove to rise up, which was done, but with difficulty. The reason of this was that they were of a totally different genius from the spirits of our earth; 
and those who are of a different genius are conveyed through various ways, so that spirits may be associated with them by means of whom conjunction may be effected. For it is the affections and thoughts 
that conjoin and disjoin spirits and angels. Insofar as they differ in respect to these, so far they appear separated from one another; but still they are conjoined by means of intermediate spirits, 
when it so pleases the Lord. This was the reason why they were brought as far as the earth Mars. </p>

THE FOURTH PLANET OUT IN SPACE  </p>
<p>I was not conveyed to this planet, dealt with in what now follows, as I was to others; instead the spirits themselves who were from that planet were brought to me. 
When they were a long way off they looked like a very long roll, which was not continuous but consisted of separate parts; for they were very many, divided into groups. At first they bore towards the 
lower parts, from where, as I perceived, they then tried to climb and so come towards me; but they were unable to. Consequently they carried on forwards, veering slightly to the left, straight on to 
the planet Mars; and from there they strove to come up, which they also succeeded in doing, though with difficulty. The reason why it all had to be done in this way was that they were of a completely 
different genius or disposition from spirits belonging to our planet; and those of a different genius are led by many different routes in order that spirits through whom links may be established can affiliate 
with them. For affections and thoughts are what link spirits and angels together or set them apart; and to the extent that their affections and thoughts are different, to the same extent they 
appear set apart from one another. But even so, they can still be linked together by means of intermediaries, when it so pleases the Lord. This was why those spirits were led straight on to the planet Mars.  </p>

</p><b>10585.</b>
Ad hanc tellurem, de qua in nunc sequentibus, non advectus sum sicut ad alias; sed ipsi spiritus qui ex tellure illa erant adducti sunt ad me; et cum ad distantiam aberant, visi sunt sicut volumen in 
longum extensum, non continuum sed discretum; plures enim erant et in cohortes; ferebantur primum versus inferiora, et perceptum quod inde ascendere conarentur; et sic ad me venire, sed quod non possent; 
quapropter pergebant paullo ad sinistrum antrorsum, usque ad tellurem Martis, et ibi nitebantur emergere, quod etiam factum sed cum difficultate. Causa quod ita fieret, erat quia prorsus alio genio 
erant quam nostrae telluris spiritus; et qui alio genio sunt, illi per varias vias feruntur ut associetur illis spiritus per quos conjunctio fiat, sunt enim affectiones et cogitationes quae conjungunt 
et disjungunt spiritus et angelos; quantum quoad illas differunt, tantum ab invicem separati apparent, sed usque conjunguntur per intermedios, cum ita Domino placet; haec causa erat quod usque ad 
Martis tellurem ducerentur. </p>
