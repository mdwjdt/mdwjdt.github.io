Verses 9-13. And Moses spoke thus unto the sons of Israel; and they heard not Moses for distress of spirit, and for hard service. And Jehovah spoke unto Moses, saying, Come, speak unto Pharaoh king of 
Egypt, and let him send the sons of Israel out of his land. And Moses spoke before Jehovah, saying, Behold the sons of Israel have not heard me; and how shall Pharaoh hear me, and I uncircumcised in 
lips? And Jehovah spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a command unto the sons of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt. "And Moses spoke 
thus unto the sons of Israel," signifies exhortation from the law Divine to those who are of the Lord's spiritual kingdom; "and they heard not Moses," signifies that they did not receive from faith 
and obedience; "for distress of spirit," signifies by reason of a state near to despair; "and for hard service," signifies by infestations from mere falsities; "and Jehovah spoke unto Moses, saying," 
signifies a continuation; "Come, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt," signifies a warning to those who infest by mere falsities; "and let him send the sons of Israel out of his land," signifies that they 
may go away and leave them; "and Moses spoke before Jehovah, saying," signifies the law from the Divine, and the thought thence derived; "Behold the sons of Israel have not heard me," signifies that 
the spiritual have not received the things announced to them; "and how shall Pharaoh hear me?" signifies that they who are in falsities will not receive; "and I uncircumcised in lips," signifies that 
to these I am impure; "and Jehovah spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron," signifies instruction anew from the law Divine, and at the same time from doctrine; "and gave them a command unto the sons of Israel," 
signifies concerning the mandate to those who are of the Lord's spiritual kingdom; "and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt," signifies a warning to those who infest by mere falsities; "to bring the sons 
of Israel out of the land of Egypt," signifies that they are to be liberated. </p>

Verses 9-13 And Moses spoke in this way to the children of Israel, and they did not hear<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> Moses, for shortness of breath and for hard<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> servitude. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, Come, speak to Pharaoh

<p>'And 
Moses spoke in this way to the children of Israel' means an exhortation from the law of God to those who belonged to the Lord's spiritual kingdom. 'And they did not hear Moses' means that 
they did not receive it in faith and obedience. 'For shortness of breath' means because of the state in which they were close to despair. 'And for hard servitude' means as a result of molestations by 
utter falsities. 'And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying' means a continuation. 'Come, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt' means a warning to those who molest by means of utter falsities. 'To send the children 
of Israel out of his land' means to go away and leave them. 'And Moses spoke to Jehovah, saying' means the law from God and thought from it. 'Behold, the children of Israel have not heard me' means 
that those who are spiritual have not received the things which have been declared to them. 'And how will Pharaoh hear me' means that those steeped in falsities are not going to accept me. 'And I am 
uncircumcised in the lips' means that to them I am impure. 'And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron' means instruction once again from the law of God and at the same time from doctrinal teachings. 'And 
gave them orders for the children of Israel' means regarding the command to be issued to those belonging to the Lord's spiritual kingdom. 'And for Pharaoh king of Egypt' means the warning to be given 
to those who molest by means of utter falsities. 'To lead the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt' means that they are to be delivered.

Vers. 9-13.  Et locutus Moscheh ita ad filios Israelis, et non audiverunt ad Moschen, prae angustia spiritus, et prae servitio duro.  Et locutus Jehovah ad Moschen, dicendo, Veni, loquere ad Pharaonem 
regem Aegypti, et mittat filios Israelis e terra sua.  Et locutus Moscheh coram Jehovah, dicendo, Ecce filii Israelis non audiverunt ad me, et quomodo audiet me Pharao, et ego praeputiatus labiis? 
 Et locutus Jehovah ad Moschen et ad Aharonem, et praecepit illis ad filios Israelis, et ad Pharaonem regem Aegypti, ad educendum filios Israelis e terra Aegypti.  `Et locutus Moscheh ita ad filios Israelis'

dicendo' significat legem a Divino et inde cogitationem: `Ecce filii Israelis non audiverunt ad me' significat quod spirituales non receperint quae illis annuntiata sunt: `et quomodo audiet ad me 
Pharao' significat quod non recepturi qui in falsis: et ego praeputiatus labiis' significat quod his sim impurus: `et locutus Jehovah ad Moschen et ad Aharonem' significat e novo instructionem ex lege 
Divina et simul ex doctrina: `et praecepit illis ad filios Israelis' significat de mandato ad illos qui e regno spirituali Domini: `et ad Pharaonem regem Aegypti' significat admonitionem ad illos qui
