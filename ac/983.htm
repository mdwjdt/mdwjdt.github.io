<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>983.</strong>“繁殖”表仁之善，“增多”表信之真，它们现在要增加。这从这两个词在圣言中的含义清楚可知，其中“繁殖”或结实通常论及仁，而“增多”通常论及信，如前所述（<a href="43.htm">43</a>，<a href="55.htm">55</a>节），我们再引用以下圣言经文来进一步证实，耶利米书：<br />背道的儿女啊，回来吧；我也必将合我心的牧者赐给你们，他们必以知识和智慧牧养你们，你们在这陆地繁殖增多。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶3.14.htm">3:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶3.16.htm">16</a>）<br />此处，“增多”明显表知识和智慧，即信的增长，而“繁殖”表仁之善。事实上，这些话描述了教会的建立，其中信或“增多”首先到来。<br />同一先知书：<br />我要将我羊群中所余剩的，从我赶他们到的所有陆地内招聚出来，领他们归回本圈，他们也必繁殖增多。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.3.htm">23:3</a>）<br />这论及已建立的教会，因而必在仁之善方面“繁殖”，在信之真方面“增多”。摩西五经：<br />我要眷顾你们，使你们繁殖增多，也要坚定我与你们所立的约。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.9.htm">26:9</a>）<br />此处就内义而言，主题是属天的教会，因此“繁殖”论及爱与仁之善，“增多”论及信的善与真。撒迦利亚书：<br />我必救赎他们，他们必增多，如从前增多一样。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚10.8.htm">10:8</a>）<br />从他们必被救赎的应许明显可知，“增多”在此论及信之真理。<br />耶利米书：<br />城必建造在山冈，必有忏悔和玩耍之人的声音从他们发出，我要使他们增多，不至减少；它的众子必如古时一样。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶30.18.htm">30:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶30.20.htm">20</a>）<br />这论及对真理和信之真理的情感。对真理的情感用“忏悔和玩耍之人的声音”来表述，而信之真理的增加用“增多”来表述。“众子”在此也表真理。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]983.</strong> The symbolism of reproducing as the good effects of charity and of multiplying as the true ideas of faith, which now increased, can be seen from the symbolism of both terms in the Word. Everywhere in the Word, reproducing (that is, bearing fruit){*1} is used in connection with charity, and multiplying in connection with faith. See earlier statements about their symbolism in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_983/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_43" target=_top>43</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_983/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_55" target=_top>55</a>. For even stronger confirmation of that symbolism, let me cite the following passages. In Jeremiah:<br />Come back, rebellious children. I will give you shepherds after my own heart, and they will pasture you with knowledge and understanding. And it will come about that you will multiply and reproduce on the earth. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_983/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_3_14" target=_top>Jeremiah 3:14</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_983/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_3_15" target=_top>15</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_983/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_3_16" target=_top>16</a>)<br />The multiplying clearly stands for growth in knowledge and understanding, that is, in faith, and reproducing stands for growth in the good effects of charity. The passage is talking about the planting of a church, and faith (multiplication) comes first in this process.<br />[2] In the same author:<br />I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the lands to which I dispersed them, and I will bring them back to their folds, and they will reproduce and multiply. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_983/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_23_3" target=_top>Jeremiah 23:3</a>)<br />This is about a church that has been planted, saying that it will reproduce or be fruitful in regard to the good effects of charity and multiply in regard to the true ideas of faith. In Moses:{*2} What is more, I will look on you and make you reproduce and make you multiply. And I will set up my compact with you. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_983/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_26_9" target=_top>Leviticus 26:9</a>)<br />The inner meaning here has to do with a heavenly type of church, so that the good inspired by love and kindness is said to reproduce, while the good impulses and true concepts of faith are said to multiply. In Zechariah:<br />I will redeem them, and they will multiply as they used to multiply. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_983/bible_king-james-version_zechariah_10_8" target=_top>Zechariah 10:8</a>)<br />The use of multiply in this verse to describe religious truth is evident from the fact that they were to be redeemed.<br />[3] In Jeremiah:<br />The city will be rebuilt on its own [ruin] mound, and praise will come out of them, as will the sound of people frolicking, and I will make them multiply, and they will not dwindle; and [Jacob's] offspring will be as they once were. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_983/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_30_18-19" target=_top>Jeremiah 30:18-19</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_983/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_30_20" target=_top>20</a>)<br />This passage is about positive responses to truth and about religious truth. Praise and the sound of people frolicking indicate positive responses to truth. Multiplication indicates an increase in the amount of religious truth. Here too the offspring, or sons, stand for truth.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The Latin word here translated "reproducing" is fructificare, which Swedenborg glosses according to its component parts: fructus, meaning "fruit;" and a verbal suffix -fico, related to facere, meaning "make" (or in this context, "bear"). [LHC, SS]<br />{*2} As was the custom in his day, Swedenborg refers to the Pentateuch (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy) as the books of Moses. [Editors] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 983</b></p><p><b>983.</b>
That "be fruitful" signifies the good of charity, and "multiply" the truths of faith, which were now about to be increased, is evident from the signification of these two expressions in the Word, where 
"to be fruitful" or to produce fruit, is constantly predicated of charity, and "to multiply" of faith, as was shown above, n. 43, 55, and in further confirmation of which we may adduce the following 
passages from the Word: </p>
<p>     Turn, O backsliding sons; I will give you shepherds according to Mine heart, and they shall feed you with knowledge and intelligence and it shall be that ye shall be multiplied 
and made fruitful in the earth (Jer. 3:14-16), where "to be multiplied" manifestly denotes growth in knowledge and intelligence, that is, in faith, and "to be made fruitful" denotes the goods 
of charity; for it there treats of the implantation of the church, in which faith or "multiplication" comes first. Again: </p>
<p>     I will gather the remnant of My flock out of all lands whither I have 
driven them, and will bring them again to their folds, and they shall be fruitful and multiplied (Jer. 23:3), speaking of a church already planted, consequently to be "made fruitful" as to the goods 
of charity and to be "multiplied" as to the truths of faith. So in Moses: </p>
<p>     Moreover I will look to you, and make you to be fruitful, and I will make you to be multiplied, and establish My covenant 
with you (Lev. 26:9), speaking in the internal sense of the celestial church, wherefore "to be fruitful" is predicated of the goods of love and charity, and "to be multiplied" of the goods and truths 
of faith. In Zechariah: </p>
<p>     I will redeem them, and they shall be multiplied as they have been multiplied (Zech. 10:8); </p>
<p>that "to be multiplied" is here predicated of the truths of faith, is evident 
from their being to "be redeemed." In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     The city shall be builded upon her own heap, and out of them shall proceed confession, and the voice of them that make merry, and I will cause 
them to be multiplied, and they shall not be diminished; their sons also shall be as aforetime (Jer. 30:18-20),speaking of the affections of truth, and of the truths of faith; the former being denoted 
by "confession, and the voice of them that make merry" and the latter by "being multiplied;" "sons" also here denote truths. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 983</b></p><p><b>983.</b>
'being fruitful' means goods stemming from charity, and 'multiplying' means truths of faith which they were now to receive as increases. This is clear from the meaning of both expressions in the Word 
where 'being fruitful', or bearing fruit, always has reference to charity, while 'multiplying' has reference to faith. See what has been stated already about the meaning of these two expressions in <a href="43.htm">43</a> 
and <a href="55.htm">55</a>. And by way of further confirmation let the following places from the Word be brought forward: In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Return, O estranged children; I will give you shepherds after My own heart, and 
they will feed you with knowledge and intelligence, and it will be that you will be multiplied and you will be fruitful in the land. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%203:14-16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 3:14-16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'being multiplied' manifestly stands for the 
growth of knowledge and intelligence, that is, of faith, while 'being fruitful' stands for goods stemming from charity. Indeed these words describe the establishment of the Church, in which faith or 'multiplying' 
comes first. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
I will gather the remnant of My flock out of all the lands where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their folds, and they will be 
fruitful and be multiplied. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2023:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 23:3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Church which has been established, and so is 'to be fruitful' as regards the goods of charity and 'to be multiplied' as regards the truths 
of faith. In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Furthermore I will have regard for you and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will establish My covenant with you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2026:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 26:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The subject at this point in the internal 
is the celestial Church, and sense therefore 'being fruitful' has reference to goods of love and charity, 'being multiplied' to goods and truths of faith. In Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will redeem them, and 
they will be multiplied as they have been multiplied. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%2010:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 10:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>It is evident from the promise that they are to be redeemed that 'being multiplied' here has reference to truths of faith. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In 
Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The city will be built upon its mound, and out of them will come confession and the voice of those who are playing, and I will multiply them and they will not grow fewer; and its sons will 
be as they were of old. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2030:18-20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 30:18-20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the affections for truth and to the truths of faith. Affections for truth are expressed by 'confession and the voice of those who are playing', 
while increases in truths of faith are expressed by 'being multiplied'. Here 'sons' also stands for truths. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 983</b>

Quod per 'fructificari' significentur bona charitatis, per 'multiplicari' vera fidei quae nunc incrementa caperent, constat a significatione utriusque vocis in Verbo, ubi 'fructificare,' seu fructus 
facere, ubique praedicatur de charitate, et 'multiplicare' de fide; videantur quae de significatione eorum prius dicta sunt, n. 43 et 55; quae ut adhuc magis confirmentur, ex Verbo licet sequentia loca 
afferre; apud Jeremiam, 	Revertimini filii aversi;... dabo vobis pastores juxta cor Meum, et pascent vos cognitione et intelligentia; et erit quod multiplicabimini et fructificabimini in terra, iii 
14-16; </p>
<p>ubi manifeste 'multiplicari' pro crescere cognitione et intelligentia, hoc est, fide; et 'fructificari' pro bonis charitatis; ibi enim de Ecclesia plantanda agitur apud quam praecedit fides 
seu multiplicatio: [2] apud eundem,                                                           	Ego congregabo reliquias gregis Mei, ex omnibus terris, quo dispuli eos; et reducam eos ad caulas suas, 
et 	fructificabuntur et multiplicabuntur, xxiii 3;                                     ubi de Ecclesia plantata; ita 'fructificari' quoad bona charitatis, et 'multiplicari' quoad vera fidei: apud Mosen, 
                        	Insuper aspiciam ad vos, et fructificari faciam vos, et multiplicari faciam vos; et erigam foedus Meum vobiscum, Lev. xxvi 9; </p>
<p>in sensu interno ibi de Ecclesia caelesti, 
quare 'fructificari' de bonis amoris et charitatis, 'multiplicari' de bonis et veris fidei, praedicatur: apud Zachariam,                                                   	Redimam eos; et multiplicabuntur, 
sicut multiplicati 	fuerunt, x 8;                                                            quod ibi 'multiplicari' praedicetur de veris fidei, patet inde quod redimendi: [3] apud Jeremiam, 	Aedificabitur 
civitas super cumulo suo,... et exibit ex illis confessio, et vox ludentium; et multiplicari faciam 	eos et non diminuentur;... et erunt filii ejus sicut olim, 	xxx 18-20;       ubi de 
affectionibus veri et de veris fidei; affectiones veri per 'confessionem et vocem ludentium,' incrementa veritatum fidei per 'multiplicari' exprimuntur; 'filii' ibi etiam pro veris. </p>
