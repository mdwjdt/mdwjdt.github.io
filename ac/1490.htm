<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1490.</strong>创世记12:18. 法老就召了亚伯兰来说，你向我作的是什么？你为什么不告诉我她是你的妻子呢？<br />“法老就召了亚伯兰来”表主的回忆。“说，你向我作的是什么”表这回忆令祂悲伤。“（你为什么不告诉我）她是你的妻子呢”表当主意识到祂应当拥有与属天之物联结的真理，而非其它真理之时。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1490.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1490/bible_king-james-version_genesis_12_18" target=_top>Genesis 12:18</a>. And Pharaoh called Abram and said, "What is this you have done to me? Why didn't you point out to me that she was your wife?"<br />And Pharaoh called Abram means that the Lord remembered. And said, "What is this you have done to me?" means that it caused him anguish. "That she was your wife" means when he realized that it would not be right for him to have any truth but truth that was wedded to something heavenly. </p>

Verse 18. And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? Why didst thou not tell me that she is thy wife? "And Pharaoh called Abram," signifies that the Lord bethought 
Himself; "and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me?" signifies that it grieved Him; "Why didst thou not tell me that she is thy wife?" signifies seeing that He knew that He ought not to have 
any other truth than that which would be conjoined with what is celestial. </p>

Verse 18 And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she is your wife? 'And Pharaoh called Abram' means that the Lord recalled to mind. 'And said, 
What is this you have done to me?' means that it grieved Him. '[Why did you not tell me] that she is your wife?' means when He recognized that He ought to possess no other truth than that which was 
to be joined to the celestial. </p>

</p><b>1490.</b>
Vers. 18.  Et vocavit Pharaoh Abramum, et dixit, Quid hoc fecisti mihi? quare non indicasti mihi, quod uxor tua illa? 'Et vocavit Pharaoh Abramum' significat quod Dominus recordatus: 'et dixit, Quid 
hoc fecisti mihi? 'significat quod ipsi indoluit: '[quare non indicasti mihi] quod uxor tua illa' significat cum nosset quod non aliud verum habere deberet quam quod conjungeretur caelesti. </p>
