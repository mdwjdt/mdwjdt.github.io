<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2960节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2960.</strong>“在你我中间还算什么呢”表他同意了，但仍渴望凭自己实现它，也就是说，被预备和改造。这从适用于论述改造的内义时的字义清楚可知。前面以弗仑说“那田地我给你，其中的洞我也给你” （23:11），这表示他们愿意在构成教会和信仰的那些事上预备自己，也就是说，改造自己。因为那些正被改造之人的最初状态就是如此（参看<a href="2946.htm">2946</a>节）。但当在真理或信仰的认知上进一步发展时，他们便进入第二个状态。在这种状态下，他们固然表示同意，但仍渴望凭自己实现它。这就是本节所论述的状态；接下来则描述了第三个状态，也就是当他们相信自己被主改造时的状态。<br />他们一开始就是这样，其原因在前面说过（<a href="2946.htm">2946</a>节）。当在真理或信仰的认知上日益发展时，他们的确承认自己被主改造，但仍渴望凭自己实现它。其中一个原因是，无知的云层只能逐渐被驱散；另一个原因是，对真理的确认需要花时间来强化；还有一个原因是，良善随着真理认知的获得而得以完善。有真理植入其中的良善本身不仅引导人们承认，而且还相信改造来自主。这就是第三个状态，随后就是第四个状态，也就是他们觉察到改造来自主时的状态。然而，很少有人在肉身生活期间获得这种状态，因为这是天使的状态。不过，那些重生之人在来世能获得它。由此明显可知，就内义而言，此处描述的是属灵教会成员，包括他尚未发展时其状态的性质，开始发展时其状态的性质，以及充分发展时其状态的性质。</p>

What is that between me and thee? That this signifies that he gave his assent, but still desired it to be from himself, namely, his being prepared or reformed, is evident from the sense of the letter 
when applied to the internal sense which treats of reformation. Above, it was said by Ephron, "The field give I thee, and the cave that is therein I give it thee" (verse 11), by which was signified that 
they desired to prepare themselves in regard to the things which are of the church and of faith, that is, reform themselves; that such is the first state of those who are being reformed may be seen 
above (n. 2946). But when they progress further in the knowledges of truth or of faith, then comes their second state, in which they indeed give assent, but still desire it to be from themselves; this 
is the state treated of in this verse; but a third state is presently described, namely, the state of belief that they are reformed by the Lord. The cause of their being such in the beginning was stated 
above (n. 2946). But that when they advance in the knowledges of truth or of faith they indeed acknowledge that they are reformed by the Lord, but still desire it to be from themselves, is for the 
reason that the cloud of ignorance is only gradually dispersed, and that the confirmations of truth are strengthened with time, and that good is perfected by imbuements of the knowledges of truth. 
It is the good itself in which the truth has been implanted that causes them not only to acknowledge but also to believe that reformation is from the Lord. This is the third state; and it is followed 
by a fourth, namely, that in which they perceive it to be from the Lord. But there are few who come into this state in the life of the body, for it is an angelic state; but they who are regenerate come 
into it in the other life. Hence it is evident that in the internal sense is here described the man of the spiritual church, and what his state is while he is yet immature; also what it is when he begins 
to mature, and at last when he has matured. </p>

'What is that between me and you?' means that he gave his assent yet still wished to achieve it by himself, that is to say, to be prepared or reformed. This becomes clear from the sense of the letter 
when applied to the internal sense in which reformation is the subject. Above, Ephron said, 'The field I give to you, and the cave that is in it I give to you' verse 11, and by this was meant their will 
to prepare themselves as regards those things that constitute the Church and faith, that is, to reform themselves. For the first state of those who are being reformed is such, see <a href="2946.htm">2946</a>; but when they 
are more advanced in cognitions of truth or faith, they have entered their second state. Then they do indeed give assent, yet they still wish to achieve it by themselves. It is this state which is 
dealt with in this verse, while the third state when they believe that their reformation is effected by the Lord will be described next. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason these people are such at first has been stated 
above in <a href="2946.htm">2946</a>. But when they become more advanced in cognitions of truth or faith they do indeed acknowledge that their reformation is effected by the Lord, yet they still wish to achieve it by themselves. 
One reason for this is that the cloud of ignorance is dispersed only gradually; another is that it takes time for truth to be corroborated; and another is that the perfection of good comes with 
the acquisition of cognitions of truth. Good itself that has truth implanted in it leads people not only to acknowledge but also to believe that reformation comes from the Lord. This state is the third, 
and a fourth follows it, that is to say, a state when they perceive that it comes from the Lord. Few however attain it during their lifetime since it is an angelic state; but those who are regenerate 
do attain it in the next life. From this it is evident that in the internal sense here the member of the spiritual Church is described - the nature of his state when he has yet to develop, the nature 
of it when he starts to develop, and at length when he has developed. </p>

Quod `inter me et inter te quid hoc?' significet quod annueret sed vellet usque a semet, nempe praeparari seu reformari, constare potest a sensu litterae applicato ad sensum internum in quo agitur de 
reformatione; supra dictum ab Ephrone, `Agrum do tibi, et speluncam quae in illo do tibi illam,' vers. 11, quibus significatum, quod vellent praeparare semet quoad illa quae sunt Ecclesiae et fidei, 
hoc est, se reformare; quod status primus illorum qui reformantur, sit talis, videatur n. 2946, at cum ulterius progrediuntur in cognitionibus veri seu fidei, tunc secundus illorum status est, quod quidem 
annuant, sed usque velint a semet; de hoc statu in hoc versu agitur; at tertius status mox describitur, quod credant reformari a Domino.  Quod tales sint in principio, causa dicta est supra n. 2946; 
quod autem cum progrediuntur in cognitionibus veri seu fidei, agnoscant quidem se reformari a Domino, sed usque velint a semet, causa est quia nubes ignorantiae successive discutitur, et quia confirmationes 
veri tempore corroborantur, et quia per imbuitiones cognitionum veri perficitur bonum; ipsum bonum cui implantatum est verum, facit ut non solum agnoscant, sed etiam credant, quod reformatio 
sit a Domino; hic status est tertius, quem sequitur status quartus, nempe quod percipiant quod a Domino; sed pauci sunt qui ad hunc statum veniunt in vita corporis, est enim angelicus; at qui regenerati 
sunt, in eum statum veniunt in altera vita.  Inde patet quod in sensu interno hic describatur homo Ecclesiae spiritualis, qualis ejus status est cum adhuc immaturus, et qualis cum maturescere incipit, 
et tandem cum maturuit. </p>
