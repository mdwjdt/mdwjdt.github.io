<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7985节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7985.</strong>经上说：“以色列人住在埃及共有四百三十年”，又补充说：“正当四百三十年终了这一天，耶和华的所有军队都从埃及地出来了”。而事实上，雅各下埃及，直到此时他的后代离开，以色列人住了不到一半的时间，也就是不到215年，这从圣经的年代顺序很明显地看出来。暗兰生摩西，哥辖生暗兰，利未生哥辖；哥辖与他的父亲一同来到埃及（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创46.11.htm">46:11</a>）。哥辖一生的岁数是133岁（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出6.18.htm">6:18</a>），生亚伦和摩西的暗兰一生的岁数是137岁（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出6.20.htm">6:20</a>），摩西站在法老面前时，是80岁的人（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出7.7.htm">7:7</a>）。经上没有提到暗兰出生时哥辖的岁数，也没有提到摩西出生时暗兰的岁数。不过，人能看出那百姓在埃及的时间跨度明显不到430年，因为甚至这三人的年龄加起来也不到430年，只有350年，只要把哥辖的岁数133、暗兰的岁数137，以及摩西站在法老面前的岁数80加起来就能看出这一点；如果按着从父亲出生到儿子出生的年岁加起来，时间更短。这个时间跨度是215年，这一点从年代顺序可以看出来。不过，从亚伯拉罕下埃及到以色列人离开这段时间是430年，这一点也能从年代顺序看出来。由此清楚可知，430年在此表示自亚伯拉罕开始，而不是自雅各开始的一整个时期。这些年被标明出来，并被称为“以色列人住在埃及的年数”是由于内义。就内义而言，这些年表示一个完全的状态，以及那些属于属灵教会并滞留在低地，直到主降临，也就是他们被释放之时的人所经历的荒凉持续的时间（<a href="6854.htm">6854</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>，<a href="7035.htm">7035</a>，<a href="7091.htm">7091</a>，<a href="7828.htm">7828</a>，<a href="7932.htm">7932</a>节）。</p>

It is said that "the dwelling of the sons of Israel which they dwelt in Egypt was thirty years and four hundred years," and further that "at the end of the thirty years and four hundred years, in this 
same day, all the armies of Jehovah went out from the land of Egypt," when yet the dwelling of the sons of Israel, from the going down of Jacob into Egypt, to the going out of his descendants at this 
time, was not more than half the time, namely, two hundred and fifteen years, as is very manifest from the chronology of the Holy Scripture. For Moses was born of Amram, Amram of Kohath, and Kohath 
of Levi; and Kohath together with his father Levi came into Egypt (Gen. 46:11). The age of the life of Kohath was 133 years (Exod. 6:18), and the age of the life of Amram, from whom were Aaron and Moses, 
was 137 years (Exod. 6:20), and Moses was a man of 80 years when he stood before Pharaoh (Exod. 7:7). It is not mentioned in what year of the age of Kohath Amram was born, nor in what year of the 
age of Amram Moses was born; but it can be seen that there were not 430 years, for even the years of their ages do not amount to 430, but only to 350, as appears from adding the years of the age of Kohath, 
133, to the years of the age of Amram, 137, and these to the 80 years of Moses when he stood before Pharaoh; still less if the years from their births be added together. That they were 215 years 
can be seen from the chronology. But from the going down of Abraham into Egypt to the going out of the sons of Israel, there were 430 years, as can also be seen from the chronology. From this then it 
is evident that by "four hundred and thirty years" is here meant the entire period of time from Abraham, and not from Jacob. That these years were designated, and were called "the years of the dwelling 
of the sons of Israel in Egypt," is on account of the internal sense, in which by these years is signified a full state, and the duration of the vastation of those who had been of the spiritual church, 
and were detained in the lower earth until the coming of the Lord, and were then liberated (n. 6854, 6914, 7035, 7091, 7828, 7932a). </p>

It says that 'the dwelling of the children of Israel, when they dwelt in Egypt, lasted four hundred and thirty years', and in addition to this that 'at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, 
even on this same day, all the hosts of Jehovah went out of the land of Egypt'. But in actual fact the dwelling of the children of Israel from Jacob's going down into Egypt until the departure of his 
descendants at this time lasted no more than half that time, no more than <a href="215.htm">215</a> years, as is evident from chronological references in Sacred Scripture. For Moses was begotten by Amram, Amram by Kohath, 
and Kohath by Levi; and Kohath came into Egypt along with Levi his father, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2046:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 46:11</a>. Kohath lived <a href="133.htm">133</a> years, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%206:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 6:18</a>; Amram, who beget Aaron and Moses, lived <a href="137.htm">137</a> years, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%206:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 6:20</a> and Moses was eighty 
years old when he stood before Pharaoh, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%207:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 7:7</a>. No mention is made of Kohath's age in years when Amram was born, or of Amram's when Moses was born. But the length of time the people were in Egypt 
was clearly not <a href="430.htm">430</a> years, since the ages of these three do not add up to as much as <a href="430.htm">430</a> years, only to <a href="350.htm">350</a>, as one may see by adding the <a href="133.htm">133</a> years of Kohath's life to the <a href="137.htm">137</a> years of Amram's, and 
then these to Moses' <a href="80.htm">80</a> years when he stood before Pharaoh. And they are less than that if one adds the years from father's birth to son's. The length of time was <a href="215.htm">215</a> years, as chronological references 
show. But the time from Abraham's going down into Egypt to the departure of the children of Israel was <a href="430.htm">430</a> years, as again chronological references show. And from this it now becomes clear that <a href="430.htm">430</a> 
years here is used to mean the whole period of time beginning right back with Abraham, not with Jacob. These years have been marked out and referred to as 'the years of the dwelling of the children 
of Israel in Egypt' on account of the internal sense. In the internal sense those years mean a state made complete and the duration of vastation undergone by those belonging to the spiritual Church who 
were held back on the lower earth until the Lord's Coming, when they were delivered, matters regarding which, see <a href="6854.htm">6854</a>, <a href="6914.htm">6914</a>, <a href="7035.htm">7035</a>, <a href="7091.htm">7091</a>, <a href="7828.htm">7828</a>, <a href="7932.htm">7932</a>. </p>

Dicitur quod `habitatio filiorum Israelis qua habitaverunt in Aegypto fuerint triginta anni et quadringenti anni,' et porro quod `a fine triginta annorum et quadringentorum annorum, in eodem die hoc, 
{1}exiverint omnes exercitus Jehovae e terra Aegypti,' cum tamen habitatio filiorum Israelis a Jacobi descensu in Aegyptum ad exitum posterorum ejus nunc, non fuerit plus quam dimidium illius temporis, 
nempe 215 annorum, ut patet manifeste a chronologicis Scripturae Sacrae; fuit enim Moscheh natus ex Amram, et Amram ex Kehath, ac Kehath ex Levi, ac Kehath simul cum Levi patre suo venit in Aegyptum, 
Gen. xlvi 11; {2}aetas vitae Kehath {3}fuit 133 annorum, Exod. vi 18, {2}ac aetas vitae Amaram, ex quo Aharon et Moscheh, 137 annorum, ibid. vers. 20; et Moscheh fuit vir 80 annorum cum stetit coram 
Pharaone, Exod. vii 7; non memoratur quo anno aetatis Kehathi natus est Amram, nec quo anno aetatis Amrami natus est Moscheh; at quod non fuerint {4}430 anni, constare potest, nam anni aetatum illorum 
ne quidem ad {4}430 assurgunt, sed ad 350; quod sciri potest si addantur anni aetatis Kehathi 133 cum annis aetatis Amrami 137, et hi cum annis Moschis 80 cum stetit coram Pharaone; {5}minus si addantur 
anni a nativitatibus illorum; quod fuerint 215 anni, ex chronologicis videri potest.  Sed ab Abrahami descensu in (x)Aegyptum ad {6}exitum filiorum Israelis fuerunt 430 anni, de quibus etiam videantur 
chronologici; inde nunc constare potest quod per 430 annos hic intelligatur integra periodus temporis usque ab Abrahamo et non a Jacobo; quod hi anni designati sint, ac dicti anni habitationis 
filiorum Israelis in Aegypto, est {7}ob sensum internum, in quo per illos significatur status plenus ac (t)duratio vastationis illorum qui ab Ecclesia spirituali fuerunt, ac in terra inferiore usque 
ad Adventum Domini detenti, ac tunc liberati, de quibus videatur n. 6854, 6914, 7035, 7091, 7828, 7932. 	@1 exiverunt$ 	@2 ac anni$ 	@3 fuerunt$ 	@4 415$ 	@5 minus anni nativitatum qui quod sint
