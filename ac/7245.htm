<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7245节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7245.</strong>“看哪，我口中没受割礼”表它是不洁的，也就是说，神的律法对那些沉浸于虚假的人来说是不洁的。<br />7245a.“法老怎肯听我呢”表因此，那些沉浸于虚假的人不会接受它。这从前面（<a href="7224.htm">7224</a>，<a href="7225.htm">7225</a>节）所述清楚可知，那里有相同的话。当摩西自称“口中没受割礼”时，按照前面（<a href="7225.htm">7225</a>节）的说明，内义上的意思是，神的律法在那些沉浸于虚假的人看来是不洁的。然而，就历史意义而言，摩西作为首领代表雅各的后代，以及凡属于他们当中的教会之物，如前所示（<a href="7041.htm">7041</a>节），“口中没受割礼”表示这个民族当中的神性敬拜具有这个性质。事实上，这个民族当中的敬拜是不洁的，因为他们敬拜外在事物，完全弃绝内在事物，也就是信与仁。而且，他们把内在事物的实际知识吐出来，正如他们对宗教仪式所表示和代表的一切所行的那样。由于这个民族具有这种性质，所以他们的敬拜是不洁的；事实上，他们出于爱自己爱世界，而非爱主爱邻敬拜耶和华。就历史意义而言，摩西自称“口中没受割礼”表示这种敬拜，但就内义而言，意思就如前面（<a href="7225.htm">7225</a>节）所解释的那样。</p>

Behold, I am uncircumcised in lips. That this signifies that it is impure, namely, the law Divine to those who are in falsities, and that and how shall Pharaoh hear me, signifies that thus they who are 
in falsities will not receive, is evident from what was said above (n. 7224, 7225), where are the same words. Moses calling himself "uncircumcised in lips," in the internal sense signifies that the 
law Divine appears impure to those who are in falsities (according to what was shown above, n. 7225); but in the historic sense, in which Moses as the head represents the posterity from Jacob, and that 
which is of the church with them (as above, n. 7041), "uncircumcised in lips" signifies that the Divine worship with that nation was such. For the worship with that nation was impure, because they 
worshiped external things, and utterly rejected internal ones, which are faith and charity; nay, they spat out the very knowledges of internal things, just as they did all those things which the rituals 
signified and represented. And as they were of this nature, their worship was impure, for they worshiped Jehovah from the love of self and the love of the world, but not from love to Him and from love 
toward the neighbor. In the historic sense, this worship is signified by Moses calling himself "uncircumcised in lips," but in the internal sense the signification has been unfolded above (n. 7225). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7245</b></p><p><b>7245.</b>
'behold, I am uncircumcised in the lips' means that it is impure, that is to say, the law of God is impure to those who are steeped in falsities. </p>
<p><a href="7245.htm">7245</a>a 'And how will Pharaoh hear me?' means that for 
that reason those steeped in falsities are not going to accept it. This is clear from what was stated above in <a href="7224.htm">7224</a> and <a href="7225.htm">7225</a>, where the same words occur. When Moses says that he is 'uncircumcised in 
the lips' the meaning in the internal sense, according to what has been shown in <a href="7225.htm">7225</a>, is that the law of God is seen to be impure by those steeped in falsities. In the historical sense however, in 
which Moses as the head stands for the descendants of Jacob and whatever there is of the Church among them, as shown above in <a href="7041.htm">7041</a>, 'uncircumcised in the lips' means that Divine worship among that nation 
was of such a nature. For the worship among that nation was impure, since they venerated outward things and totally rejected inner values, which are faith and charity. Indeed they spurned any actual 
recognition of inner realities, such as all those which religious observances served to mean and represent. And because that nation was like this their worship was impure; for they were led to worship 
Jehovah by self-love and love of the world, not by love to Him and love towards the neighbour. This impure worship is meant in the historical sense when Moses says that he is 'uncircumcised in the 
lips'; but the meaning in the internal sense is as explained above in <a href="7225.htm">7225</a>. </p>

`Ecce ego praeputiatus labiis':  quod significet quod impura, nempe lex Divina, illis qui in falsis. </p>
<p>7245a.  `Et quomodo audiet ad me Pharao?': quod significet quod sic non recepturi qui in falsis, 
constat ex illis quae supra n. 7224 et 7225 dicta sunt, ubi eadem verba.  Quod Moscheh se dicat praeputiatum labiis, in sensu interno significat quod lex Divina impura appareat illis qui in falsis, 
secundum illa quae n. 7225 ostensa sunt; in sensu autem historico, in quo Moscheh ut caput refert posteritatem ex Jacobo ac id quod est Ecclesiae apud illos, ut supra n. 7041; `praeputiatus labiis' significat 
quod cultus Divinus apud gentem illam talis esset; erat enim cultus apud illam gentem {1} impurus, nam externa colebant ac interna prorsus rejiciebant, quae {2}sunt fides et charitas; immo ipsas 
cognitiones rerum internarum respuebant sicut omnia illa quae ritualia significabant (c)et repraesentabant; et quia tales erant, cultus erat impurus, colebant enim Jehovam ex amore sui et amore mundi, 
non autem ex amore in Ipsum et ex amore erga proximum; hic cultus in sensu historico significatur per quod `Moscheh se dicat praeputiatum labiis,' at in sensu interno significatur prout explicatum
