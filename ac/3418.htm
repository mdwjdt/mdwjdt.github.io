<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3418.</strong>创世记26:18.在他父亲亚伯拉罕的日子他们所挖的水井，因非利士人在亚伯拉罕死后塞住了，以撒就回来又挖出来，仍照他父亲给它们起的名字，叫它们的名字。<br />“在他父亲亚伯拉罕的日子他们所挖的水井，以撒就回来又挖出来”表主揭示了古人所具有的那些真理。“因非利士人在亚伯拉罕死后塞住了”表只有认知的记忆知识之人拒绝承认这些真理。“叫它们的名字”表它们的本质。“仍照他父亲给它们起的名字”表真理的有意义的符号。</p>

Verse 18. And Isaac returned, and digged again the wells of waters which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; and the Philistines stopped them up after the death of Abraham; and he called 
their names after the names which his father called them. "And Isaac returned, and digged again the wells of waters which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father," signifies that the Lord 
opened those truths which were with the ancients; "and the Philistines stopped them up after the death of Abraham," signifies that they who were in the mere memory-knowledge of knowledges denied those 
truths; "and he called their names," signifies their quality; "after the names which his father called them," signifies significatives of truth. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3418</b></p><p><b>3418.</b>
Verse 18 And Isaac came back and dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father and which the Philistines had been stopping up after Abraham's death; and he called 
them names, according to the names which his father had called them. </p>
<p>'Isaac came back and dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father' means that the Lord disclosed 
the truths that had existed with the Ancients. 'And which the Philistines had been stopping up after Abraham's death' means that people who had no more than a knowledge of cognitions refused to 
recognize those truths. 'And he called them names' means the essential nature of them. 'Like the names which his father had called them' means meaningful signs of truth. </p>

</p><b>3418.</b>
Vers. 18.  Et redibat Jishak, et refodit puteos aquarum, quos foderunt in diebus Abrahami patris ejus, et obturabant illos Philistaei post mortem Abrahami, et vocavit illis nomina, secundum nomina, 
quae vocavit illis pater ejus. `Redibat Jishak et refodit puteos aquarum quos foderunt in diebus Abrahami patris ejus' significat quod Dominus illa vera aperiret quae apud antiquos: `et obturabant illos 
Philistaei post mortem Abrahami' significat quod qui in sola scientia cognitionum, illa negarent: `et vocavit illis nomina' significat quale illorum: `sicut nomina quae vocavit illis pater ejus' significat 
veri significativa. </p>
