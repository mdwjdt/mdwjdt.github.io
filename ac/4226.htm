<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4226节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4226.</strong>新来的灵人活在世上时内在就是邪恶，只是表面上凭着他们为了自己和尘世的缘故向别人所行的而披上良善的外装。他们有时抱怨自己不被允许进入天堂。因为他们对天堂没有任何概念，以为只要“凭着恩典”允许即可。他们有时得到这样的答复：天堂不拒绝任何人；他们若愿意，就会得到恩准。其中一些灵人也确实被允许进入最接近入口的天上社群；但一到那里，如前所述，他们就感觉呼吸停顿，并陷入地狱般的痛苦和折磨中，这一切都是因为他们生命的对立和抵制性。所以他们向后踉跄，退了回来，后来声称，对他们来说，天堂就是地狱，他们永远想不到他们所看到的天堂竟是这个样子。</p>

Spirits recently arrived, who when they lived in the world had been inwardly evil, but had outwardly assumed the appearance of good by means of the works which they had done to others for the sake of 
themselves and the world, have sometimes complained that they were not admitted into heaven; for they had no other notion about heaven than that of admission from favor. But they have sometimes received 
for answer that heaven is denied to no one; and that if they desire it, they will be admitted. Some have also been admitted into the heavenly societies nearest the entrance; but on arriving there, 
they, as before said, observed a cessation of their breathing on account of the contrariety and resistance of their life, together with distress and torment as it were infernal, and they cast themselves 
down and afterwards said that to them heaven was hell, and that they would never have believed heaven to be of such a character. </p>

Spirits recently arrived there who have been inwardly evil during their life in the world but who outwardly have tried to acquire an appearance of good by means of works which they had done to others 
for selfish and worldly reasons, have sometimes complained about not being allowed into heaven. For they had no other concept of heaven than of being allowed in 'by grace'. They have been told in reply 
sometimes that heaven is not denied to anyone and if they so desire they will be let in. Some of them have indeed been let into the heavenly communities situated nearest the entrance; but having entered 
those spirits realized that their breathing had stopped, in the way described above, and that they were seized with a hell-like pain and torment, all of which was due to the contrary and antagonistic 
nature of their life. So they reeled back from there, saying finally that to them heaven was hell, and that they would never have believed that heaven was what they now saw it to be like. </p>

{1}  Quandoque conquesti sunt recentes spiritus, qui interius mali fuerunt (o)cum in mundo vixerunt, sed exterius apparentiam boni aucuparunt per opera quae fecerunt aliis sui et mundi causa, quod 
non admittantur in caelum, illi enim non aliam opinionem de caelo habuerunt quam admissionis ex gratia; sed illis quandoque responsum est quod nulli negetur caelum, et si cupiunt quod admittendi, 
etiam aliqui admissi in societates caelestes proximas quae ad introitum, sed cum illuc venerunt, ex contrarietate et repugnantia vitae perceperunt, ut dictum, respirationis cessationem, angorem, et 
cruciatum sicut infernalem, et se dejecerunt inde; dicentes dein quod caelum illis infernum esset, et quod nusquam crediderint caelum tale esse.      @1 This [ ] was written, after 4228 but has directions
