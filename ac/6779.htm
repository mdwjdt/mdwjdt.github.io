<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6779节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6779.</strong>“有牧羊的人来把她们赶走了”表沉浸于邪恶的教导者反对他们。这从“牧羊的人”、“赶走”和女儿的含义清楚可知：“牧羊的人”是指那些进行教导并引向仁之良善的人（参看<a href="343.htm">343</a>，<a href="3795.htm">3795</a>，<a href="6044.htm">6044</a>节），在此是指那些虽进行教导，但因沉浸于邪恶而未引向仁之良善的人，如下文所述；“赶走”是指反对；女儿，即此处他们所赶走的人，是指属于教会的事物，如前所述（<a href="6775.htm">6775</a>节）。“牧羊的人”在此表示那些虽进行教导，却未引向仁之良善的人，因为他们沉浸于邪恶。事实上，那些沉浸于邪恶的人从来就不承认仁爱及其行为有助于救恩，因为他们无法承认违背他们生活的东西，这样做就是违背他们自己。他们因沉浸于邪恶，因此甚至不知道何为仁爱，故而也不知道何为仁爱的行为。他们教导信仰，声称他们因这信而称义，因这信而有天堂的应许。他们就是那些反对取自圣言的仁之教义，因而反对处于简单良善的真理之人的人；处于简单良善的真理之人由“米甸祭司的女儿”来表示；她们打了水，并打满槽给羊群喝之后，牧羊的人把她们从井旁赶走。</p>

And the shepherds came, and drove them away. That this signifies that the teachers who were in evils set themselves in opposition, is evident from the signification of "shepherds," as being those who 
teach and lead to the good of charity (see n. 343, 3795, 6044), here those who teach, but as they are in evils do not lead to the good of charity (of which hereafter); from the signification of "driving 
away," as being to set themselves against; and from the signification of "daughters," who are those whom they drove away, as being the things of the church (of which above, n. 6775). By "shepherds" 
are here indeed signified those who teach, but who do not lead to the good of charity, because they are in evils. For those who are in evils never acknowledge that charity and its works contribute to 
salvation, because they cannot acknowledge what is contrary to their life, as this would be contrary to themselves. And because they are in evils, they do not even know what charity is, nor therefore 
what the works of charity are. They teach faith; by this they justify; and by it they promise heaven. These are they who set themselves against the doctrine of charity which is from the Word, consequently 
against those who are in the truth of simple good, who are signified by the "daughters of the priest of Midian," whom the shepherds drove away from the well, after they had drawn and filled the 
troughs to give drink to the flock. </p>

'And the shepherds came and drove them away' means that teachers steeped in evils set themselves against them. This is clear from the meaning of 'the shepherds' as those who teach and lead to the good 
of charity, dealt with in <a href="343.htm">343</a>, <a href="3795.htm">3795</a>, <a href="6044.htm">6044</a>, here those who teach but, being steeped in evils, do not lead to the good of charity, dealt with below; from the meaning of 'driving away' as setting themselves 
against; and from the meaning of the daughters, the ones whom they drove away, as things belonging to the Church, dealt with above in <a href="6775.htm">6775</a>. Here 'shepherds' does indeed mean those who teach, but 
they are those who do not lead to the good of charity because they are steeped in evils. For those steeped in evils never acknowledge that charity and its works contribute to salvation, because they 
are incapable of acknowledging things contrary to the life they lead. To do so would be to go against themselves. Being steeped in evils they are not even aware of what charity is, or thus of what the 
works of charity are. Faith is what they teach, saying that faith is what makes people righteous and what holds the promise of heaven. These are the ones who set themselves against the teachings about 
charity drawn from the Word, and therefore against people guided by the truth that goes with simple good - the people meant by the daughters of the priest of Midian who, after they had drawn water and 
filled the troughs to water the flock, were driven away by the shepherds from the well. </p>

`Et venerunt pastores, et depulerunt illas': {1}quod significet docentes qui in malis, quod se opponerent, constat ex significatione `pastorum' quod sint qui docent et ducunt ad bonum charitatis, de 
qua n. 343, 3795, 6044, hic qui docent, sed {2}quia in {3}malis sunt, non ducunt ad bonum charitatis, de {4}qua sequitur; ex significatione `depellere' quod sit se opponere; et ex significatione `filiarum,' 
quae {5} sunt quas depulerunt, quod sint quae Ecclesiae, de qua supra n. 6775.  Per `pastores' hic quidem significantur qui docent, sed qui non ducunt ad bonum charitatis quia in malis sunt; {6}nam 
qui in malis sunt nusquam agnoscunt quod charitas et ejus opera {7} ad salutem faciant non enim agnoscere possunt quae contra vitam eorum sunt, nam hoc foret contra semet; et quia in malis sunt, 
ne quidem sciunt quid charitas, ita nec quid charitatis opera; fidem docent, per illam justificant, et per illam pollicentur caelum; hi sunt qui se opponunt doctrinae charitatis quae ex Verbo, {8}proinde 
illis qui in vero simplici boni, {9}qui significantur per `filias sacerdotis Midianis' quas e puteo postquam hauserunt et impleverunt canaliculos ad potandum gregem, pastores depulerunt. 	@1 o in
