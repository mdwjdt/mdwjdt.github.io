<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9386节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9386.</strong>“摩西将耶和华的一切话都写下来”表此后把它们铭刻在生命上。这从“摩西”的代表，以及“写”和“耶和华的一切话”的含义清楚可可知：“写”是指铭刻在生命上，如下文所述；“摩西”是指圣言方面的主（参看<a href="9372.htm">9372</a>，<a href="9382.htm">9382</a>节）；“耶和华的一切话”是指来自圣言的真理（<a href="9383.htm">9383</a>节）。由此明显可知，“摩西将耶和华的一切话都写下来”表示被主铭刻在生命上的神之真理。当真理成为意愿，并由此成为行为的事时，就说它们被铭刻在生命上。只要仍停留在记忆中，并且只要仅在知识层面上被看待，它们就不会铭刻在生命上。不过，一旦用意愿来领受它们，它们就变成生命的一部分，因为意愿和随之而来的行为是一个人生命的真正本质。在此之前，这些真理不会变成此人自己的。<br />“写”之所以表示铭刻在生命上，是因为写的目的就是给所有后代作纪念。铭刻在一个人生命上的事物也是如此。可以说人有两本书，他的一切思维和行为都写在其中。这两本书就是他的两种记忆，即外部记忆和内部记忆。写在他内部记忆中的事物会永远存留，永远不会被抹去。它们主要是那些已变成意愿，就是变成爱的一部分的事物；因为被爱的事物就是意愿的一部分。这种记忆就是每个人的生命册所表示的（参看<a href="2474.htm">2474</a>节）。</p>

And Moses wrote all the words of Jehovah. That this signifies an impressing thereafter on the life, is evident from the signification of "writing," as being to impress on the life (of which in what follows); 
from the representation of Moses, as being the Lord in respect to the Word (see n. 9372, 9382); and from the signification of "all the words of Jehovah," as being truths from the Word (n. 9383). 
From this it is evident that by "Moses wrote all the words of Jehovah," are signified truths Divine impressed on the life by the Lord. Truths are said to be impressed on the life, when they become 
of the will and from this of the act. So long as they stay merely in the memory, and so long as they are looked at only intellectually, they have not been impressed on the life; but as soon as they are 
received in the will, they become of the life, because the very being of man's life is to will, and from this to act; and before this they have not been appropriated to the man.  [2] That "to write" 
denotes to impress on the life, is because the purpose of writings is remembrance to all posterity. So is it with the things impressed on a man's life. Man has as it were two books, in which have been 
written all his thoughts and acts. These books are his two memories, the exterior and the interior. The things written on his interior memory remain to all eternity, and are never blotted out, and 
are chiefly those which have become of the will, that is, of the love; for the things of the love are of the will. It is this memory which is meant by every man's book of life (see n. 2474). </p>

'And Moses wrote all Jehovah's words' means imprinting them at the same time on the life. This is clear from the meaning of 'writing' as imprinting them on the life, dealt with below; from the representation 
of 'Moses' as the Lord in respect of the Word, as above in <a href="9372.htm">9372</a>, <a href="9382.htm">9382</a>; and from the meaning of 'all Jehovah's words' as truths from the Word, also dealt with above, in <a href="9383.htm">9383</a>. From this it is evident 
that 'Moses wrote all Jehovah's words' means God's truths imprinted by the Lord on the life. Truths are said to have been imprinted on the life when they become matters of will and consequently 
of action. As long as they remain fixed solely in the memory, and as long as they are regarded on solely an intellectual level, they have not been imprinted on the life. But as soon as they are accepted 
with the will they are made part of the life, because willing and consequent action are the real essence of the life of a person. Till then those truths have not become the person's own.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The 
reason why 'writing' means imprinting on the life is that written accounts of things exist for the sake of remembrance by every future generation. It is similar with the things that have been imprinted 
on a person's life. A person has two books so to speak in which all his thoughts and deeds have been written down. These books are his two memories, the exterior one and the interior one. The things 
written down in his interior memory are those which remain to all eternity and can never be blotted out. They are primarily those things which have been made part of the will, that is, of love since 
things that are loved are part of the will. This memory is what someone's 'book of life' is used to mean, see <a href="2474.htm">2474</a>.  </p>

</p><b>9386.</b>
`Et scripsit (x)Moscheh omnia verba Jehovae':  quod significet impressionem tunc vitae, constat ex significatione `scribere' quod sit imprimere vitae, de qua sequitur, ex repraesentatione `Moschis' 
quod sit Dominus quoad Verbum, ut supra n. 9372, 9382, et ex significatione `omnium verborum Jehovae' quod sint vera ex Verbo, de qua etiam supra n. 9383; inde patet quod per `scripsit Moscheh omnia verba 
Jehovae' significentur vera Divina impressa vitae a Domino.  Vera dicuntur impressa vitae quando fiunt voluntatis et inde actus; quamdiu solum in memoria haerent, et quamdiu solum spectantur intellectualiter, 
tamdiu non impressa vitae sunt; sed ut primum recipiuntur voluntate, tunc fiunt vitae, quoniam ipsum esse vitae hominis est velle et inde agere; prius nec appropriata sunt homini. 2 Quod 
`scribere' sit imprimere vitae, est quia scripturae sunt ob reminiscentiam in omnem posteritatem; similiter quae impressa sunt hominis vitae; sunt homini bini quasi libri, quibus inscripta sunt omnia 
ejus cogitata et acta; libri illi sunt binae ejus memoriae, exterior et interior; quae inscripta sunt ejus memoriae interiori, illa in omnem aeternitatem permanent nec usquam delentur; sunt praecipue 
illa quae voluntatis facta sunt, hoc est, quae amoris, nam quae amoris sunt voluntatis sunt; illa memoria est quae intelligitur per `librum vitae' cujusvis, videatur n. 2474. </p>
