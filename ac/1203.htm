<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1203节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1203.</strong>“赫”表对属天事物的外在认知。这从前面所述清楚可知。在先知书中，属灵和属天事物通常联在一起，也就是说，论述属灵事物时，也会论述属天事物。原因在于，一个源于另一个，若它们没有联在一起，完美性就会有所缺失。所以，天堂婚姻的形像存在于圣言的每一个事物中。由此，以及由圣言的其它地方明显可知，“西顿”表对属灵事物的外在认知，“赫”表对属天事物的外在认知。它们具有双重含义，也就是说，既用于没有内在事物时，也用于有内在事物时，还单纯表示外在认知。如前面频繁所述，属灵事物就是那些属于信的事物，属天事物则是那些属于意愿的事物。“赫”表缺乏内在的外在认知，这一点明显可见于以西结书：<br />主耶和华对耶路撒冷如此说，你的根源，你的出身，是在迦南陆地；你的父亲是亚摩利人，母亲是赫人。你正是你母亲的女儿，厌弃丈夫和儿子；你正是你姐妹的姐妹，厌弃丈夫和儿子。你母亲是赫人，你父亲是亚摩利人。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.3.htm">16:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.45.htm">45</a>）<br />此处缺乏内在的外在敬拜是指“迦南”；“厌弃丈夫和儿子”是指拒绝接受善与真，这就是为何他们的母亲被称为“赫人”的原因；此外，在圣言中，“赫”还表在好的那方面对属天事物的认知，如几乎所有国、城、民族和人的名字那样，至于原因，前面已解释过了。关于“赫”的这种含义，蒙主怜悯，容后再述。对属灵事物的认知是指那些关乎信，因而关乎教义的认知，而对属天事物的认知则是那些关乎爱，因而关乎生活的认知。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1203.</strong> The fact that Heth symbolizes a superficial knowledge of heavenly attributes follows logically. The prophets customarily link spiritual and heavenly ideas; where they speak of spiritual properties, they also speak of heavenly ones. The one set comes from the other, so a certain perfection is missing unless they are joined. A further purpose is to bring an image of the heavenly marriage into each and every part of the Word.{*1} These considerations (not to mention other illustrative passages in the Word) show that Sidon symbolizes a shallow knowledge of spiritual qualities while Heth symbolizes a shallow knowledge of heavenly ones. They symbolize this knowledge in both senses — both with and without deeper knowledge. In addition they stand simply for superficial knowledge.<br />Spiritual entities, as noted many times before, are aspects of faith, and heavenly entities are aspects of love. Again, spiritual traits belong to the intellect, heavenly ones to the will.{*2} [2] The symbolism of Heth as shallow knowledge devoid of deeper knowledge can be seen in Ezekiel:<br />This is what the Lord Jehovih has said to Jerusalem: "Your trading and your birth origins belong to the land of Canaan. Your father is an Amorite and your mother a Hittite.{*3} You are the daughter of your mother, who showed disgust for her man and her children; and the sister of your sisters, who showed disgust for their husbands and their children. Your mother is a Hittite and your father an Amorite." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1203/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_16_3" target=_top>Ezekiel 16:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1203/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_16_45" target=_top>45</a>)<br />In this passage, outward worship without inward is Canaan. Showing disgust for their husbands and children is spurning things that are good and true, which is why their mother is called a Hittite.<br />Heth in the Word is also taken to stand for a relatively superficial knowledge of heavenly attributes in a good sense. Almost all the names of lands, cities, nations, and individuals do have a good sense, for the reason given earlier [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1203/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1151" target=_top>1151:1</a>].

That "Heth" signifies exterior knowledges of celestial things is consequently evident. It is customary in the Prophets for spiritual and celestial things to be joined together, that is, where spiritual 
things are treated of, celestial things are also treated of; for the reason that the one is from the other, and there is a certain want of perfection if they are not conjoined; so that there is an 
image of the heavenly marriage in each and all things of the Word. It is also evident from this, as well as from the Word in other places, that by "Zidon" are signified exterior knowledges of spiritual 
things, and by "Heth" exterior knowledges of celestial things, in both senses-that is to say, without internal things, and with internal things-and also simply exterior knowledges. Spiritual things, 
as has often been said before, are those which are of faith; and celestial things are those which are of love; and again, spiritual things are those which are of the understanding, and celestial things 
are those which are of the will. That "Heth" signifies exterior knowledges without internal, is evident in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Thus saith the Lord Jehovih unto Jerusalem, Thy tradings and thy nativity are 
of the land of Canaan; thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother a Hittite. Thou art thy mother's daughter, that loatheth her man [vir] and her sons; and the sister of thy sisters, that loathed their 
husbands and their sons. Your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite (Ezek. 16:3, 45). Here external worship without internal is "Canaan;" to "loathe husbands and sons," is to reject goods 
and truths. Hence her mother is called "a Hittite." But "Heth" is also taken in the Word for exterior knowledges of celestial things in a good sense, as are nearly all names of countries, cities, nations, 
and persons, for a reason already explained. Concerning this signification of "Heth," by the Divine mercy of the Lord hereafter. Knowledges of spiritual things are those which have regard to faith, 
consequently to doctrine; and knowledges of celestial things are those which have regard to love, and thus to life. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1203</b></p><p><b>1203.</b>
'Heth' means exterior cognitions of celestial things, as is clear from what is said above. In the Prophets it is common for spiritual and celestial things to be linked together, that is, when spiritual 
things are dealt with so are celestial things, the reason being that one stems from the other, and perfection is somewhat lacking if they are not linked together. Consequently a likeness to the heavenly 
marriage exists in every single part of the Word. From this as well as other places in the Word it is also clear that Sidon means exterior cognitions of spiritual things, while Heth means exterior 
cognitions of celestial things. They are used in both senses, that is to say, either when internals are missing or when they are present, as well as being used to stand simply for exterior cognitions. 
As stated frequently already, spiritual things are those that belong to faith, celestial things those that belong to love. Spiritual things are also those that belong to the understanding, and celestial 
those that belong to the will. That 'Heth' means exterior cognitions devoid of internal is clear in Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said the Lord Jehovih to Jerusalem, Your tracings and your nativity are of the 
land of Canaan Your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite. You are the daughter of your mother who loathes her husband and her sons; and you are the sister of your sisters who loathed their 
husbands and their sons. Your mother is a Hittite and your father an Amorite. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2016:3,%2045&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 16:3, 45</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here external worship devoid of internal is 'Canaan'. 'Loathing husbands and sons' is spurning goods 
and truths, and this is why their mother is called 'a Hittite'. In addition to this 'Heth' in the Word also stands for exterior cognitions of celestial things in a good sense, as, for reasons dealt with 
already, almost all names of lands, cities, nations, and persons are so used. In the Lord's Divine mercy the meaning of 'Heth' will be dealt with later on Cognitions of spiritual things are those 
that have regard to faith, and so to doctrine, while cognitions of celestial things are those that have regard to love, and so to life. </p>

</p><b>1203.</b>
Quod 'Heth' significet cognitiones exteriores caelestium, inde constat; apud Prophetas sollemne est quod spiritualia et caelestia conjungantur, seu ubi agitur de spiritualibus, etiam de caelestibus, 
ex causa quia unum est ab altero, et non perfectio quaedam est nisi conjuncta sint, utque instar conjugii caelestis sit in omnibus et singulis Verbi; inde quoque constat, praeter a Verbo alibi, quod 
per 'Zidonem' significentur cognitiones exteriores spiritualium, per 'Hethum' vero cognitiones exteriores caelestium, in utroque sensu, nempe tam absque internis quam cum internis, ut et simpliciter pro 
cognitionibus exterioribus:  spiritualia sunt, ut saepe prius dictum, quae sunt fidei, caelestia quae sunt amoris; tum, spiritualia sunt quae intellectus, et caelestia quae voluntatis; quod 'Heth' 
cognitiones exteriores absque internis significet, constat apud Ezechielem,@Sic dixit Dominus Jehovih Hierosolymae, Negotiationes tuae, et natales tui de terra Canaane, pater tuus Emoraeus, et mater Hittaea.... 
 Filia matris tuae tu, fastidientis virum suum et filios suos; et soror sororum tuarum, quae fastidiverunt maritos suos, et filios suos, mater vestra Hittaea, et pater vester Emoraeus, xvi 
3, 45;@ubi cultus externus absque interno est 'Canaan'; 'fastidire maritos et filios' est respuere bona et vera, inde mater eorum vocatur 'Hittaea.'  Praeterea 'Heth' in Verbo quoque pro cognitionibus 
exterioribus caelestium in bono sensu accipitur, sicut fere omnia nomina terrarum urbium, gentium, personarum, ex causa de qua prius; de qua significatione Hethi, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in {1}sequentibus. 
 Cognitiones spiritualium sunt quae spectant fidem, ita doctrinam, cognitiones autem caelestium sunt quae spectant amorem, ita vitam.@@1 See n. 2913, 4447, etc.$ </p>
