<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8943节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8943.</strong>“就把坛污秽了”表在这种情况下敬拜是不存在的。这从“污秽”的含义清楚可知，“污秽”是指造成没有任何敬拜存在。自我聪明的产物本身缺乏生命，事实上在属灵层面是死的，因为人的自我或人自己无非是邪恶。因此，如果对神的敬拜源于自我，那么这种敬拜无非是对一个偶像、雕像或铸像的敬拜；它们没有灵，也就是没有生命在里面。但是，唯有源于圣言的东西才能服务于向神所献上的敬拜，因为这种东西本身是活的。事实上，圣言的每一个部分里面都有一个灵义，这灵义论述的是主的国度；这内义里面则有神性，因为圣言在其至内在意义上只论述主。圣言的圣洁和生命唯源于此，而非来自其它任何源头。圣言好比一个神性人；字义可以说是他的身体，而内义则可以说是他的灵魂；由此明显可知，字义通过内义接受生命。表面上看，字义似乎通过内义消失或死去了；但事实恰恰相反。它不会消失，更不会死去；相反，它通过内义而活或接受生命。由此清楚可知，对神的真正敬拜来源于圣言的事物，根本不来源于那些出于自我聪明的事物。正因如此，“你在上头一动凿子，就把坛污秽了”表示如果你制造了诸如要构成对神的敬拜的那类事物，但这些事物不是圣言，而是自我聪明的产物，那么敬拜是不存在的。</p>

Thou wilt profane it. That this signifies that then there will be no worship, is evident from the signification of "profaning," as being to cause that there is not any worship. For that which is from 
self-intelligence is in itself void of life, nay, is spiritually dead, for man's own is nothing but evil; and therefore if Divine worship is performed from it, this worship is nothing else than the worship 
of an idol, graven or molten, wherein there is no spirit, that is, no life. But that which is from the Word is alone serviceable for Divine worship, because it is in itself alive. For within everything 
of the Word there is a spiritual sense, which treats of the Lord's kingdom; and within this sense is the Divine, because the Word in its inmost sense treats of the Lord alone; from this is the 
sanctity and the life of the Word, and not from any other source. The Word is like a Divine man; the literal sense is as it were his body, but the internal sense is as it were his soul; which shows 
that the literal sense has life through the internal sense. It appears as if the literal sense vanishes or dies through the internal sense; but on the contrary it does not vanish, still less dies; but 
through the internal sense it lives. From all this it is now evident that worship truly Divine has its existence from those things which are of the Word, and in no case from those things which are of 
self-intelligence. Hence it is that by "if thou move a tool upon the altar thou wilt profane it," is signified, if thou devise not from the Word, but from self-intelligence such things as must be of 
Divine worship, there is no worship. </p>

'You will profane it' means that no worship in that case exists. This is clear from the meaning of 'profaning' as bringing about the nonexistence of any worship. For in itself the product of self- intelligence 
is devoid of life, indeed is spiritually dead, since the human proprium or self is nothing but evil. Consequently if the worship of God has its origin in the self that worship is no different 
at all from the worship of an idol or a graven or molten image, which have no spirit, that is, no life, within them. But what springs from the Word, only this can be of service for offering worship 
to God, since this is in itself living. For within the Word, in every single part, there is a spiritual sense, which deals with the Lord's kingdom; and within that internal sense there is the Divine, 
since the Word in its inmost sense deals with the Lord alone. This is the source of the holiness and life of the Word; it derives them from no other source. The Word may be likened to a Divine human 
being; the literal sense is so to speak his body, while the internal sense is so to speak his soul, from which it is evident that the literal sense receives life through the internal sense. It seems as 
though the literal sense disappears or dies through the internal sense; but the contrary is the reality. It does not disappear, still less does it die; rather it receives life through the internal sense. 
From all this it is now clear that a true worship of God has its origin in things of the Word and not at all in those of self- intelligence. So it is that 'if you move a chisel over the altar, you 
will profane it' means that if you have fashioned such things as are to constitute the worship of God, and they are not products of the Word but of self-intelligence, no worship exists. </p>

</p><b>8943.</b>
`Et profanabis illud': quod significet quod tunc nullus cultus, constat ex significatione `profanare' quod sit facere ut non sit aliquis cultus; quod enim ex propria intelligentia est, hoc in se expers 
vitae est, immo spiritualiter mortuum, nam proprium hominis non est nisi quam malum; quapropter si ex eo fit cultus Divinus, is cultus non aliud est quam sicut cultus idoli, sculptilis seu fusilis, 
in quibus non spiritus, hoc est, non vita; at quod ex Verbo est, id solum pro cultu Divino inservit, est enim id in se vinum; intus enim in singulis Verbi est sensus spiritualis, qui agit de regno Domini, 
et intus in illo sensu est Divinum, nam Verbum in intimo suo sensu agit de solo Domino; inde est sanctitas et vita Verbi, et non aliunde; Verbum est sicut Divinus homo, sensus litteralis est ejus 
quasi corpus, at sensus internus est ejus quasi anima; inde patet quod vivat sensus litteralis per sensum internum.  Apparet sicut sensus litteralis evanescat seu moriatur per sensum internum; sed 
contrarium est, non evanescit, minus moritur, sed per sensum internum vivit.  Ex his nunc constat quod ex illis quae sunt Verbi, existat cultus vere Divinus et nullatenus ex illis quae sunt intelligentiae 
propriae; inde est quod per `si moveris caelum super altari, profanabis illud' significetur, si non ex Verbo, sed ex propria intelligentia finxeris talia quae (x)cultus Divini erunt, quod nullus 
cultus sit. </p>
