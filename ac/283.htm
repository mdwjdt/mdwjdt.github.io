<p><strong>[NCE]283.</strong> The fourth generation, among whom earthly good began to disappear. Had they been created anew or been taught the heavenly ideas involved in faith, they would have perished. This is the force of the words, "Perhaps people will put out their hand and take from the tree of lives as well, and live forever" (verse 22). </p>

Of the fourth posterity, in which natural good began to be dissipated, and which, had they been created anew or instructed in the celestial things of faith, would have perished, which is meant by, "Lest 
he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of lives, and eat, and live to eternity" (verse 22). </p>

The fourth generation among whom natural good began to melt away is dealt with in verse 22. Had they been created anew or received instruction in heavenly matters of faith they would have perished, which
