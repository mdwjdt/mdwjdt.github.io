<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3293节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3293.</strong>“两族在你肚里”表属世人的内部和外部良善，也就是怀孕。这从“（民）族”的含义清楚可知，“（民）族”是指良善，尤指教会的良善（参看<a href="1159.htm">1159</a>，<a href="1258.htm">1258</a>，<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>，<a href="1416.htm">1416</a>，<a href="1849.htm">1849</a>节）。此处表示属世人中的良善，这一点从以下事实明显可知：当时在肚子里的以扫和雅各代表主的神圣属世人，这从下文论述他们的地方很明显地看出来。和理性人一样，属世人也是由良善与真理构成的。属世人中的良善是指属于属世情感并被称为快乐的一切；而属世人中的真理是指属于记忆并被称为记忆知识的一切。这二者必须存在于属世人中，以便它成为属世人。若凭着自己，脱离属于情感的快乐，记忆知识根本什么也不是，因为属世人正是从它里面的快乐获得自己的生命，也正是从这快乐获得认识事物的能力。而快乐，也就是属世人的良善，没有记忆知识，尽管仍是某种事物，但只是诸如婴儿所具有的那种活力。因此，属世人要成为人，就必须由这两个元素构成，并且这一个被那一个所完善。但它从良善接受生命本身。<br />关于此处所论述的良善。这良善是双重的，既有内部的，也有外部的。内部良善与内层人，即理性人相通；而外部良善则与外在人，即属于肉体的事物相通，并给外在感官，以及行动带来生命。若没有这种双重沟通，人无论就理性而言，还是就肉体而言，都无法存活。死后与人同居，然后构成其属世生命的，正是这内部沟通。灵人也有属世生命，其属灵生命就止于作为其终极层的属世层中。因为人死后若不通过属于其属世层的事物，就不能立刻作属灵的思考。然而，外部沟通是人活在肉身时所拥有的东西，它会随着肉体的死亡而终结。所有这一切表明“两族在你肚里”是什么意思，也就是表示属世人的内部和外部良善。“在肚里”（womb）就内义而言，表示怀孕，故此处在论及那良善时，经上说“怀了孕”。</p>

Two nations are in thy womb. That this signifies the natural as to interior and exterior good, that there is conception, is evident from the signification of "nations," as being goods, especially the 
goods of the church (see n. 1159, 1258, 1260, 1416, 1849); and that here the goods which are in the natural are signified, is evident from the fact that Esau and Jacob, who were then in the womb, represent 
the Lord's Divine natural, as will become very evident from what follows, where they are treated of. The natural, like the rational, consists of good and truth; the good in the natural is all that 
which is of natural affection, and is called delight; but the truth is all that which is of the memory, and is called memory-knowledge. These two must be in the natural for there to be any natural. 
By itself, memory-knowledge abstractedly from any delight which is of affection, is not anything; for the natural has its life from the delight within it; and from this derives its ability to know anything; 
whereas delight, which is the good of the natural, is something without memory-knowledge; but only such a vitality as infants have. In order therefore for the natural to be human it must consist 
of both, the one being perfected by the other; but it has its real life from good.  [2] As regards this good which is here treated of, it is twofold, interior and exterior; the interior good communicates 
with the interior man, that is, with the rational; while the exterior good communicates with the external man, that is, with the things of the body, and makes the life in the external senses, 
and also in the actions. Without this twofold communication, man cannot live either as to the reason or as to the body. It is the interior communication which abides with man after death, and then makes 
his natural life, for a spirit also has natural life, inasmuch as his spiritual life is terminated in the natural as in an ultimate plane; for immediately after death a man is not able to think spiritually, 
except from the things that belong to his natural. The exterior communication, however, is that which a man has while he lives in the body, but this ceases by the death of the body. All this 
shows what is signified by "two nations in the womb," namely the natural as to interior and exterior good. "In the womb," in the internal sense, signifies conception, therefore it is here said "that 
there is conception." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3293</b></p><p><b>3293.</b>
'Two nations are in your womb' means the natural as regards good, interior and exterior, which is conception. This is clear from the meaning of 'nations' as goods, in particular of the Church, dealt 
with in <a href="1159.htm">1159</a>, <a href="1258.htm">1258</a>, <a href="1260.htm">1260</a>, <a href="1416.htm">1416</a>, <a href="1849.htm">1849</a>. Here goods within the natural are meant, as is evident from the consideration that Esau and Jacob, who at that time were in the womb, represent the Lord's Divine 
Natural, as will be quite clear from what follows in the part where they are the subject. As with the rational the natural consists of good and of truth. The good within the natural includes all that 
which goes with natural affection and is called delight, whereas the truth within the natural includes all that which is part of knowledge and is termed factual knowledge. These two must be present in 
the natural for it to be the natural. By itself and isolated from the delight which belongs to affection, factual knowledge is not anything at all - it being from delight that the natural gets its life, 
since it is from this that the natural may come to know anything. However, if delight, which is the good of the natural, is devoid of factual knowledge, it is nevertheless something, though only a 
vital spark, as it is in young children. For the natural to be human therefore it has to consist of both elements, the one perfecting the other. But life itself it receives from good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As for the 
good which is the subject here, it is twofold - interior and exterior. Interior good communicates with the interior man, that is, with the rational, while exterior good communicates with the external, 
that is, with the things that belong to the body, bringing life to the external senses as well as to actions. Without such communication in both parts no one is able to live as a rational being or 
as a physical organism. Interior communication is what remains with a person after death and then constitutes his natural life, for a spirit too possesses natural life since his spiritual life is encompassed 
in the natural as the ultimate level of it. For no one is able to think spiritually immediately after death except from the things that belong to his natural. Exterior communication however is 
what a person has while he is living in the body, but it comes to an end with the death of the body. From these considerations it may now be seen what 'two nations in the womb' means, namely the natural 
as regards good, interior and exterior. 'In the womb' means, in the internal sense, conception, and this is why at this point the expression 'which is conception' is used in reference to that good. </p>

`Duae gentes in utero tuo': quod significet naturale quoad bonum interius et exterius, quod conceptio, constat ex significatione `gentium' quod sint bona, imprimis Ecclesiae, de qua n. 1159, 1258, 1260, 
1416, 1849, hic quod sint bona quae in naturali, patet ex eo quod `Esau et Jacob,' qui tunc in utero, repraesentent Divinum Naturale Domini, ut manifeste constabit ex sequentibus ubi de illis agitur; 
naturale sicut rationale consistit ex bono et vero; bonum in naturali est omne id quod affectionis naturalis est, et jucundum {1}vocatur, verum autem omne id quod scientiae est, et scientificum dicitur; 
haec bina erunt in naturali, ut sit naturale; ipsum scientificum per se {2}abstracte a jucundo quod est affectionis, non est aliquid; a jucundo {3}illo habet naturale suam vitam, {4}nam ex illo 
habet, {5}ut scire aliquid possit; jucundum autem quod est bonum naturalis absque scientifico est aliquid, sed modo est vitale, quale {6}apud infantes; ut itaque naturale sit humanum, ex utroque consistet, 
{7}perficitur unum ab altero, sed ipsam vitam habet a bono. [2] Quod autem hoc bonum concernit, de quo hic agitur, est duplex, interius et exterius; interius communicat cum interiore homine, hoc 
est, cum rationali, exterius {8}cum {9}externo, hoc est, cum illis quae sunt corporis, et facit vitam sensibus externis, tum quoque actionibus; absque communicatione utrinque non potest homo ratione 
vivere, nec potest corpore; communicatio interior est, quae manet homini post mortem, et ibi facit vitam ejus naturalem, nam spiritus etiam vitam naturalem {10}habet, vita enim {11}ejus spiritualis 
terminatur in naturali ut in plano ultimo, nam non potest homo statim post mortem spiritualiter cogitare nisi ex illis quae sunt naturalis ejus; communicatio autem exterior est, quae est homini cum vivit 
in corpore, sed ea cessat per corporis mortem; ex his nunc constare potest quid per `duas gentes in utero' significatur, nempe naturale quoad bonum interius et exterius. `In utero' significat in sensu 
interno conceptionem, ideo hic dicitur quod sit conceptio. @1 dicitur$  @2 i seu$  @3 ibi I$  @4 et quoque$  @5 quod$  @6 i est$  @7 i et$  @8 i autem$  @9 externis$  @10 habent$  @11 
illorum$  </p>
