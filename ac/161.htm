<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第161节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>161.</strong>上古教会的这一代依然是良善的，但是他们渴望进入外在，活在自我中，主就许了他们，并慈悲地把属灵属天之性注入其中。要了解内在和外在是如何协作一致，看似一体的，得先了解内在是如何流入外在的。拿人的行为来说，若无仁慈亦即爱与信在行为中，并主在爱与信中，该行为就不能称为仁慈之行或信心之果。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]161.</strong> This later generation of the earliest church was not evil; they were still good. And because they were eager to live in their outer being or selfhood, the Lord granted them their wish. In his mercy, though, he wove a heavenly-spiritual quality into their self-sufficiency.<br />In order to understand how the inner and outer being act in concert, or appear as one, it is necessary to know how the one exerts an influence on the other. To form at least some idea of this, take action as an example. An action that does not have charity (or love and faith) behind it and the Lord behind that is not an action that can be called either a charitable deed or the fruit of faith. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 161</b></p><p><b>161.</b>
This posterity of the Most Ancient Church was not evil, but was still good; and because they desired to live in the external man, or in their Own, this was permitted them by the Lord, what is spiritual 
celestial, however, being mercifully insinuated therein. How the internal and external act as a one, or how they appear as a one, cannot be known unless the influx of the one into the other is known. 
In order to conceive some idea of it, take for example an action. Unless in an action there is charity, that is, love and faith, and in these the Lord, that action cannot be called a work of charity, 
or the fruit of faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 161</b></p><p><b>161.</b>
These descendants of the Most Ancient Church were not evil; they were still good people. And since they desired to live in the external man or proprium, the Lord did allow it; but He mercifully instilled 
something celestial-spiritual. How the internal and external act as one, or how they appear to be one, cannot be known unless it is known how one flows into the other. To gain some idea of this, 
take, for example, an action. Unless charity, or love and faith, lies within it, and the Lord within these, the action is not an action that can be called a work of charity or the fruit of faith.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 161</b>
</p><b>161.</b>
Posteritas haec Antiquissimae Ecclesiae non erat mala sed usque bona; et quia cupivit vivere in externo homine seu in proprio, ei datum quoque a Domino, sed ex misericordia insinuatum caeleste spirituale. 
 Quomodo internum et externum unum agunt, seu quomodo apparent tanquam unum, non sciri potest nisi sciatur influxus unius in alterum; ut solum idea ejus capiatur, sit exemplo actio, in qua nisi 
insit charitas, seu amor et fides, et Dominus in illis, actio non est actio quae dici potest opus charitatis aut fructus fidei. </p>
