<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10703节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10703</strong>.“就揭去帕子，直到他出来为止”表那时的一种光照的状态。这从“揭去帕子”的含义清楚可知。“揭去帕子”是指使内在之物显现，因为当揭去帕子时，他的脸和面皮发光就变得显而易见了；“脸”表示内层事物，“发光”表示来自这些内层事物、在外在之物里面的光。“脸”表示内层事物（参看<a href="9546.htm">9546</a>节提到的地方）；“摩西面皮发光”表示来自圣言的内在、在圣言的外在里面的闪耀或光（<a href="10691.htm">10691</a>节）。它之所以被称为光，是因为光照人的内在的光是从主发出的神性真理。这真理就是天堂之光，因而是天使和灵人观看所凭借的光，也是被光照的人所拥有的感知和聪明的源头（参看<a href="9548.htm">9548</a>，<a href="9684.htm">9684</a>节提到的地方）。它被称为“在来自圣言内在的圣言外在里面的光”；但这句话的意思是说，当人阅读圣言时，在来自其心智内在的心智外在里面的光。因为圣言只在一个处于来自内在的光之人的眼前闪耀；圣言本身只是写下来的文字。由此明显可知摩西的面皮为何发光，以及这在内义上表示什么。</p>

He removed the veil until he went out. That this signifies a state of enlightenment then, is evident from the signification of "removing the veil," as being the appearing of the internal, for when the 
veil was removed, the faces and the shining of their skin appeared; and by the "faces" are signified the interiors; and by the "shining" is signified the light therefrom in the external. That the "faces" 
denote the interiors may be seen at the places cited in n. 9546; and that the "shining of the skin of Moses' faces" denotes the shining forth, or the light from the internal, in the external of 
the Word, n. 10691. It is said "light" because the light which illumines the internal of man is the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord. That this is the light of heaven, thus the light from which 
angels and spirits see, and also that from which the man who is enlightened has perception and intelligence, may be seen at the places cited in n. 9548, 9684. It is said "light in the external of the 
Word from its internal," but there is meant light in the external of man from its internal when he is reading it, for the Word does not shine from itself except before the eyes of a man who is in light 
from the internal. Without this the Word is merely the letter. From this then it is evident whence came the shining of the skin of Moses' faces, and what this signifies in the internal sense. </p>

'He took the veil off until he was going to come out' means a state of enlightenment then. This is clear from the meaning of 'taking the veil off' as causing what is inward to appear; for when the veil 
was taken off, his face and the gleaming of its skin was evident, and 'the face' means interior things and 'the gleaming' the light from these within what is outward.  </p>
<p>'The face' means interior 
things, see in the places referred to in <a href="9546.htm">9546</a>.  'The gleaming of the skin of Moses' face' means the shining forth or the light from the inward level of the Word within the outward, <a href="10691.htm">10691</a>.  </p>
<p>It is called 
light because the light which enlightens a person inwardly is Divine Truth emanating from the Lord. For more about this Truth as the light of heaven, consequently as the light by which angels and 
spirits see things, and also as the source of the perception and intelligence in the person who is enlightened, see in the places referred to in <a href="9548.htm">9548</a>, <a href="9684.htm">9684</a>. But though it is called light within the 
outward level of the Word coming from its inward level, this should be taken to mean light in the outward level of the human mind coming from its inward level when the person reads it. For the Word does 
not shine forth except before the eyes of one who sees things in light from an inner level; by itself the Word is merely something written down. From all this it is now evident why it was that the 
skin of Moses' face gleamed and what this means in the internal sense.  </p>

`Removit velamen usque ad exire illum':  quod significet statum illustrationis tunc, constat ex significatione `removere velamen' quod sit apparentia interni, nam cum removebatur velamen, patebant facies 
et coruscatio {1}cutis earum, et per `facies' significantur interiora, (c)ac per `coruscationem' lux inde in externo; quod `facies' sint interiora, videatur in locis citatis n. 9546, et quod `coruscatio 
cutis facierum Moschis' sit elucentia seu lux ab interno in externo Verbi, n. 10691.  Lux dicitur quia lux quae illuminat internum hominis, est Divinum Verum procedens a Domino; quod hoc sit 
lux caeli, ita e qua angeli et spiritus vident, et quoque e qua homo qui illustratur {2}perceptionem et intelligentiam habet, videatur in locis citatis n. 9548, 9684.  (m)Dicitur lux in externo Verbi 
ab interno ejus, sed intelligitur lux in externo hominis ab interno ejus cum legit illud, nam Verbum non lucet ex se nisi coram homine qui in luce ab interno est; absque illo est Verbum modo littera.(n) 
 Inde {3}nunc patet unde `coruscatio cutis facierum Moschis,' et quid in sensu interno significat. @1 ibi$ @2 percipiat$ @3 manifeste$ </p>
