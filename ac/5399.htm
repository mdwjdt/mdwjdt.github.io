<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5399.</strong>创世记42:1-5.雅各见埃及有谷子，雅各就对儿子们说，你们为什么彼此观望呢？他又说，看哪，我听见埃及有谷子，你们可以下到那里，从那里给我们买，使我们可以存活，不至于死。于是，约瑟的十个哥哥都下去，从埃及买五谷。但约瑟的兄弟便雅悯，雅各没有打发他和哥哥们同去，因为雅各说，恐怕他遭害。在前来的人当中，以色列的儿子们也来要买，因为迦南地也有饥荒。<br />“雅各见”表构成信的事物，“雅各”表就教会所知的真理而言的属世层。“埃及有谷子”表通过记忆知识，也就是“埃及”获得真理的意图。“雅各就对儿子们说”表对总体真理的觉知。“你们为什么彼此观望呢”表为何他们将注意力集中在这些东西上，或为何他们犹豫不决。“他又说，看哪，我听见埃及有谷子”表真理能通过记忆知识获得。“你们可以下到那里，从那里给我们买”表通过那记忆知识将它们变成它自己的。“使我们可以存活，不至于死”表由此所得的属灵生命。“于是，（约瑟的十个哥哥）都下去”表努力和行动，或目标和努力。“约瑟的十个哥哥”表诸如教会所知的彼此一致的那类真理。“从埃及买五谷”表通过记忆知识将真理的良善变成它自己的。“但约瑟的兄弟便雅悯”表属天层的属灵层，也就是居间层。“雅各没有打发他和哥哥们同去”表它们没有这居间层。“因为雅各说，恐怕他遭害”表没有属灵层的属天层，也就是“约瑟”，这居间层就会灭亡。“在前来的人当中，以色列的儿子们也来要买”表它渴望通过记忆知识获得属灵真理，就像获得其它一切真理一样。“因为迦南地也有饥荒”表就属世层中的教会事物而言，荒凉的存在。</p>

Verses 1-5. And Jacob saw that there was produce in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons, Why do ye look at one another? And he said, Behold I have heard that there is produce in Egypt; get you down thither, 
and buy for us from thence; and we shall live, and not die. And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn from Egypt. And Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, 
Peradventure mischief may befall him. And the sons of Israel came to buy in the midst of those that came; for the famine was in the land of Canaan. "And Jacob saw," signifies the things which are 
of faith ("Jacob" signifies the natural as to the truth which is of the church); "that there was produce in Egypt," signifies a disposition to procure truths by means of memory-knowledges, which are 
"Egypt;" "and Jacob said to his sons," signifies perception regarding truths in general; "Why do ye look at one another?" signifies why did they hesitate; "and he said, Behold I have heard that there 
is produce in Egypt," signifies that truths can be procured by means of memory-knowledges; "get you down thither, and buy for us from thence," signifies appropriation by means of them; "and we shall live, 
and not die," signifies spiritual life thereby; "and they went down," signifies endeavor and act; "Joseph's ten brethren," signifies such truths of the church as corresponded; "to buy corn from Egypt," 
signifies to appropriate to themselves the good of truth by means of memory-knowledges; "but Benjamin, Joseph's brother," signifies the spiritual of the celestial, which is the intermediate; "Jacob 
sent not with his brethren," signifies that they were without this intermediate; "for he said, Peradventure mischief may befall him," signifies that without the celestial of the spiritual, which 
is "Joseph," it would perish; "and the sons of Israel came to buy in the midst of those that came," signifies that it desired that spiritual truths, like all others, should be procured by means of memory-knowledges; 
"for the famine was in the land of Canaan," signifies that there was desolation as to the things of the church in the natural. </p>

Verses 1-5 And Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt; and Jacob said to his sons, Why do you look at one another? And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt; go down there, and buy 
for us from there, and let us live and not die. And Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt. And Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob did not send with his brothers, for he said, Perhaps 
harm may come to him. And the sons of Israel came to buy in the midst of others who came; for the famine was in the land of Canaan. </p>
<p>'And [Jacob] saw' means the things that constitute faith. 'Jacob' 
means the natural so far as truth known to the Church is concerned. 'That there was corn in Egypt' means the intention to acquire truths to itself through factual knowledge, which is 'Egypt'. 'And 
Jacob said to his sons' means perception regarding truths as a general whole. 'Why do You look at one another?' means, Why did they fix their attention on these? 'And he said, Behold, I have heard that 
there is corn in Egypt' means that truths can be acquired through factual knowledge. 'Go down there, and buy for us from there' means making them its own through that knowledge. 'And let us live and 
not die' means spiritual life received from this. 'And Joseph's ten brothers] went down' means an aim and endeavour. 'Joseph's ten brothers' means such truths known to the Church as were in agreement 
with one another. 'To buy grain from Egypt' means to make the good of truth its own through factual knowledge. 'And Benjamin, Joseph's brother' means the spiritual of the celestial, which is the intermediary. 
'Jacob did not send with his brothers' means without that intermediary. 'For he said, Perhaps harm may come to him' means that without the celestial of the spiritual, which is 'Joseph', that 
intermediary will perish. 'And the sons of Israel came to buy in the midst of others who came' means the wish to acquire spiritual truths, like all other truths, through factual knowledge. 'For the famine 
was in the land of Canaan' means that desolation existed so far as things of the Church in the natural were concerned. </p>

Vers. 1-5.  Et vidit Jacob quod esset annona in Aegypto, et dixit Jacob filiis suis, Quare aspicitis vos?  Et dixit, Ecce audivi quod sit annona in Aegypto, descendite illuc, et emite nobis in de, et 
vivamus et non moriamur.  Et descenderunt fratres Josephi decem, ad emendum frumentum ex Aegypto.  Et Benjaminem fratrem Josephi non misit Jacob cum fratribus ejus, quia dixit, Forte obveniat illi damnum. 
 Et venerunt filii Israelis ad emendum in medio venientium, quia fuit fames in terra Canaan.  `Et vidit' significat illa quae fidei: `Jacob' significat naturale quoad verum quod Ecclesiae: `quod 
esset annona in Aegypto' significat animum comparandi sibi vera per scientifica quae sunt `Aegyptus': `et dixit Jacob filiis suis' significat perceptionem de veris in communi: `Quare aspicitis vos?' 
significat cur haererent: `et dixit, Ecce audivi quod sit annona in Aegypto' significat quod comparari queant vera per scientifica: `descendite illuc et emite nobis inde' significat appropriationem per 
illa: `et vivamus et non moriamur' significat inde vitam spiritualem: `et descenderunt' significat conatum et actum: `fratres ,Josephi decem' significat talia vera Ecclesiae quae corresponderent: `ad 
emendum frumentum ex Aegypto' significat ad appropriandum sibi bonum veri per scientifica: `et Benjaminem fratrem Josephi' significat spirituale caelestis quod medium: `non misit Jacob cum fratribus 
ejus' significat quod absque illo medio: `quia dixit, Forte obveniat illi damnum' significat quod id absque caelesti spiritualis quod `Josephus', periturum:  `et venerunt filii Israelis ad emendum in 
medio venientium' significat quod vellet ut spiritualia vera aeque compararentur per scientifica, sicut reliqua: `quia fuit fames in terra Canaan' significat quod desolatio quoad illa quae sunt Ecclesiae 
in naturali. </p>
