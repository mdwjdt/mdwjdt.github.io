<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>739.</strong>“诸水的泛滥”表试探的开始。这一点从以下事实清楚可知：此处所阐述的试探涉及觉知之物，如前所述，这种试探首先到来，相对温和。所以它被称为“诸水的泛滥”，而不是象17节那样被简单称为一场洪水。因为“水”的原义是人的属灵事物，信的觉知之物，还表示它们的对立面，即虚假，如圣言中大量经文所证实的。<br />②诸水的泛滥或淹没表示试探，这一点从本章开篇的介绍（<a href="705.htm">705</a>节）和以西结书清楚可知。以西结书：<br />主耶和华如此说：我要使狂风吹裂我的墙，在我的愤怒中使暴雨漫过，又发烈怒降下大冰雹毁灭这墙，我必拆毁你们用石灰水所涂抹过的墙。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结13.13.htm">13:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结13.14.htm">14</a>）<br />“狂风”和“暴雨”表虚假的凄凉，“用石灰水所涂抹过的墙”表看似真理的编造。以赛亚书：<br />耶和华神作躲暴风雨的避难所，作避炎热的阴凉，因为强暴人如同暴风直吹墙壁。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛25.4.htm">25:4</a>）<br />“暴风”表涉及觉知之物的试探，这种试探完全不同于被称为“炎热”的涉及意愿之物的试探。<br />③同一先知书：<br />看哪，主有一大能大力者，像一阵冰雹，像毁灭的暴风，像涨溢的大水。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛28.2.htm">28:2</a>）<br />这描述的是试探的程度。<br /><br />你从水中经过，我必与你同在；你趟过江河，水必不漫过你；你从火中行过，必不被烧，火焰也不着在你身上。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛43.2.htm">43:2</a>）<br />“水”和“河”表虚假和幻想，“火”和“火焰”表邪恶和恶欲。诗篇：<br />因此，凡虔诚人都当趁你可寻找的时候祷告你。大水泛溢的时候，必不能到他那里。你是我藏身之处，你必拯救我脱离苦难。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗32.6.htm">32:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗32.7.htm">7</a>）<br />“大水泛溢”表试探，在同一篇章中还被称为洪水，如：<br />洪水泛滥之时，耶和华坐着为王；耶和华坐着为王，直到永远。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗29.10.htm">29:10</a>）<br />这些引文和本章开篇的介绍（<a href="705.htm">705</a>节）表明，洪水或诸水的泛滥无非表示试探和消磨，尽管按着上古之人的习俗，它被描述为历史事件。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]739.</strong> The symbolism of the flood of water on the earth as the onset of trial follows from the fact that the present subject is struggles in respect to intellectual issues — struggles that come first and are relatively slight, as explained. For this reason it is called a flood of water, not simply a flood, as it is in verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_739/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_17" target=_top>17</a> below. Water mainly symbolizes our spiritual possessions, the intellectual elements of faith, and the opposites of these, which are falsities. The Word contains many passages that support this meaning.{*1} [2] The symbolism of a flood of water as times of trial can be seen from the evidence offered in the preface to this chapter [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_739/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_705" target=_top>705</a>]. It can also be seen in Ezekiel:<br />This is what the Lord Jehovih has said: "I will make a stormy wind break out in my wrath, and in my anger a flooding downpour will take place, and hail stones in my rage, until their full end, so that I destroy the wall that you coated with your foolish plaster." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_739/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_13_11" target=_top>Ezekiel 13:11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_739/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_13_13-14" target=_top>13-14</a>)<br />The stormy wind and flooding downpour stand for the ruination that falsity causes. The wall coated with foolish plaster stands for a fiction that seems to be the truth. In Isaiah:<br />Jehovah God is a shelter from the flood, a shade from the heat, for the spirit of the violent is like a flood against a wall. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_739/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_25_4" target=_top>Isaiah 25:4</a>)<br />The flood stands for a challenge to our way of thinking, and it differs from a challenge to the intentions of our will, which is called heat.<br />[3] In the same author:<br />Indeed, the Lord has someone who is strong and mighty, like a flood of hail, a storm of obliteration, like a flood of strong, overflowing water. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_739/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_28_2" target=_top>Isaiah 28:2</a>)<br />This describes different levels of distress. In the same author:<br />When you cross through the water, I will be with you, and [when you cross] through the rivers, they will not flood over you. When you go through fire, you will not be burned, and flame will not scorch you. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_739/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_43_2" target=_top>Isaiah 43:2</a>)<br />The water and rivers stand for falsity and fantasies, the fire and flame for evil and cravings. In David:<br />All the godly will pray to you over this at the time when they find you, so in a flood of many waters, [the waters] will not reach them. You are a hiding place for me; you will save me from anguish. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_739/bible_king-james-version_psalms_32_6-7" target=_top>Psalms 32:6-7</a>)<br />The flood of waters stands for trials. Another word for flood{*2} is also applied to them in the same author:<br />Jehovah sits by the flood, and Jehovah sits as monarch forever. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_739/bible_king-james-version_psalms_29_10" target=_top>Psalms 29:10</a>)<br />These passages and those prefacing the chapter [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_739/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_705" target=_top>705</a>] show clearly that a flood of water simply symbolizes times of trial and of devastation, even though described as if part of a story, according to the custom of the earliest people.{*3} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For Bible passages relating to water, see the verses quoted in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_739/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_28" target=_top>28</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_739/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_108" target=_top>108-109</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_739/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_680#subsection-2-3" target=_top>680:3</a>, and 790. [LHC]<br />{*2} The Latin word translated "flood" or "overflow" in all the other quotations here and in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_739/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_705" target=_top>705</a> is inundatio (or one of its variants). The one used in the quotation of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_739/bible_king-james-version_psalms_29_10" target=_top>Psalms 29:10</a> is diluvium, which is the same word that Swedenborg uses in quotations from Genesis. These distinctions reflect differences in the original language; the Hebrew word used in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_739/bible_king-james-version_psalms_29_10" target=_top>Psalms 29:10</a> (מַבּוּל [mabbûl]) is the same as that used in Genesis and is different from the term used anywhere else in the Old Testament.

That by the "flood of waters" is signified the beginning of temptation, is evident from temptation as to things of the understanding being here treated of, which temptation precedes, and, as before said, 
is light; and for this reason it is called a "flood of waters" and not simply "a flood" as in the seventeenth verse. For "waters" signify especially the spiritual things of man, the intellectual 
things of faith, and the opposites of these, which are falsities; as may be confirmed by very many passages from the Word.  [2] That a "flood" or "inundation" of waters signifies temptation, is evident 
from what was shown in the introduction to this chapter. So also in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Thus saith the Lord Jehovih, I will make a stormy wind to break through in My fury, and an inundating rain shall there 
be in Mine anger, and hailstones in wrath, unto the consummation, that I may destroy the wall that ye have daubed with what is unfit (Ezek. 13:13-14). Here a "stormy wind" and an "inundating rain" 
denote the desolation of falsities; the "wall daubed with what is unfit" denotes fiction appearing as truth. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>    Jehovah God is a protection from inundation, a shadow from the heat, for 
the breath of the violent is as an inundation against the wall (Isa. 25:4). An "inundation" here denotes temptation as to things of the understanding, and is distinguished from temptation as to things 
of the will, which is called "heat."  [3] Again: </p>
<p>     Behold the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, as an inundation of hail, a destroying storm, as an inundation of mighty waters, overflowing (Isa. 
28:2), where degrees of temptation are described. And again:       When thou passest through the waters I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee; when thou walkest 
through the fire thou shalt not be burned, and the flame shall not kindle upon thee (Isa. 43:2). "Waters" and "rivers" here denote falsities and phantasies, "fire" and "flame" evils and cupidities. 
In David: </p>
<p>      For this shall everyone that is holy pray unto Thee at a time of finding; so that in the inundation of many waters they shall not reach unto him; Thou art my hiding place; Thou wilt 
preserve me from trouble (Ps. 32:6-7),where the "inundation of waters" denotes temptation which is also called a "flood." In the same: </p>
<p>     Jehovah sitteth at the flood; yea, Jehovah sitteth King forever 
(Ps. 29:10). From these passages, and from what was premised at the beginning of this chapter, it is evident that a "flood" or "inundation" of waters signifies nothing else than temptations and 
vastations, although described historically, after the manner of the most ancient people. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 739</b></p><p><b>739.</b>
'A flood of waters' means the onset of temptation. This is clear from the fact that the temptation dealt with here regards things of the understanding, which temptation, as has been stated, comes first 
and is mild. Consequently it is called 'a flood of waters' and not simply a flood, as in verse 17 below. For the primary meaning of 'waters' is man's spiritual things, matters of faith in the understanding, 
and also their opposites, which are falsities, as may be confirmed from so many places in the Word. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That a flood of waters or a deluge means temptation is clear from what has been shown 
in the preliminary section of this chapter,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and also in Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said the Lord Jehovah, I will make a stormy wind<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> break out in My wrath, and there will be a deluging rain in My anger, and 
hailstones in rage to consume it, so that I may break down the wall you daub with whitewash. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2013:11,%2013,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 13:11, 13, 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'stormy wind<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> and 'deluging rain' stand for the desolation of falsity, 'a wall 
daubed with whitewash' for a fabrication which looks like the truth. In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah God is a shelter from the deluge, a shade from the heat, for the spirit of violent men is like a deluge against 
a wall. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2025:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 25:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'deluge' stands for temptation as regards things of the understanding, which is quite different from temptation as regards things of the will, which is called 'heat'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, the Lord has one who is mighty and strong, like a deluge of hail, a destroying tempest, like a deluge of mighty overflowing waters. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2028:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 28:2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
This describes 
degrees of temptation. In the same prophet, When you pass through the waters I will be with you; and through the rivers, they will not deluge you. When you go through fire you will not be burned, and 
the flame will not consume you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2043:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 43:2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'waters' and 'rivers' stand for falsities and delusions,' fire' and 'flame' for evils and evil desires. In David,  </p>
<blockquote>
Therefore everyone who is holy 
will pray to You at a time of discovering. In the deluge of many waters they will not reach him. You are a hiding-place for me, You will save me from distress. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2032:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 32:6, 7</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'deluge of waters' 
stands for temptation, which is also called a flood in the same author, Jehovah sits over the flood; and Jehovah sits as King for ever. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2029:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 29:10</a>. </p>
<p>These quotations and those given in the preliminary 
section of this chapter<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> show that a flood or deluge of waters means nothing other than temptations and vastations, even though according to the custom of the most ancient people the description 
is of historical events.

Quod per 'diluvium aquarum' significetur tentationis incohamentum, inde constat quod hic de tentatione quoad intellectualia agatur, quae tentatio praecedit et levis est, ut dictum; quare appellatur 
'diluvium aquarum,' non simpliciter diluvium, ut seq. vers. 17; 'aquae' enim imprimis significant spiritualia hominis, intellectualia fidei, tum illis opposita, seu falsa, ut permultis a Verbo confirmari 
potest. Quod diluvium aquarum seu inundatio significet tentationem constat ab illis quae in praemissis hujus capitis ostensa sunt, tum quoque apud Ezechielem, Sic dixit Dominus Jehovih, Faciam perrumpere 
spiritum procellarum in excandescentia Mea; et imber inundans in ira Mea fiet, et lapides grandinis in fervore, ad consummationem, ut destruam parietem, quem incrustatis inepto, xiii 11, 13, 
14; </p>
<p>ubi 'spiritus procellarum, et imber inundans' pro desolatione falsi; 'paries incrustatus inepto' pro ficto apparente sicut verum: apud Esaiam, Jehovah Deus protectio ab inundatione, umbraculum ab 
aestu, nam spiritus violentorum sicut inundatio parietis, xxv 4; </p>
<p>ibi 'inundatio' pro tentatione quoad intellectualia, et distinguitur a tentatione quoad voluntaria, quae vocatur 'aestus': apud eundem, Ecce 
validus et robustus Domino, sicut inundatio grandinis, procella excisionis, sicut inundatio aquarum validarum superinundantium, xxviii 2; </p>
<p>ibi gradus tentationis descripti: apud eundem, Cum 
transieris per aquas, tecum Ego, et per flumina, non inundabunt te; cum iveris per ignem, non adureris, et flamma non comburet te, xliii 2; </p>
<p>ubi 'aquae et flumina' pro falsis et phantasiis, 'ignis et 
flamma' pro malis et cupiditatibus: apud Davidem, Super hoc precabitur omnis sanctus ad Te tempore inveniendi; unde in inundatione aquarum multarum ad illum non pertingent; tu latibulum mihi, ab angustia 
servabis me, Ps. xxxii 6, 7; </p>
<p>ubi 'inundatio aquarum' pro tentatione; quae etiam appellatur diluvium: apud eundem, Jehovah ad diluvium sedet; et sedet Jehovah Rex in aeternum, Ps. xxix 10. Ex 
his et a praemissis ante hoc caput, patet quod 'diluvium seu inundatio aquarum' nihil aliud significet quam tentationes et vastationes, tametsi historice, secundum morem antiquissimorum, descriptum. </p>
