The Internal Sense.	 Verses 1-5. And the famine became grievous in the land. And it came to pass when they had finished the eating of the produce which they had brought from Egypt, and their father 
said unto them, Go back, buy us a little food. And Judah spoke unto him, saying, Protesting the man did protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my faces except your brother be with you. If thou wilt 
send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food. And if thou wilt not send, we will not go down; for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my faces except your brother be with you. "And 
the famine became grievous," signifies desolation from want of spiritual things; "in the land," signifies about the things that were of the church; "and it came to pass," signifies what is new; "when 
they had finished the eating of the produce," signifies when truths failed; "which they had brought from Egypt," signifies which were from memory-knowledges; "and their father said unto them," signifies 
perception from the things of the church; "Go back, buy us a little food," signifies that in order to live they must procure for themselves the good of spiritual truth; "and Judah spoke unto him," 
signifies the good of the church; "saying, Protesting the man did protest unto us," signifies that the spiritual derived from the internal was averse to them; "saying, Ye shall not see my faces," signifies 
that there will be no compassion; "except your brother be with you," signifies unless there is an intermediate for you; "if thou wilt send our brother with us," signifies that if it is so done by 
the church that adjunction shall take place, there must be an intermediate; "we will go down and buy thee food," signifies that then the good of truth will be procured there; "and if thou wilt not send 
him," signifies if not; "we will not go down," signifies that it cannot be procured; "for the man said unto us," signifies perception concerning the spiritual; "Ye shall not see my faces," signifies 
that there will be no compassion; "except your brother be with you," signifies unless there is an intermediate for you. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE </p>
<p>Verses 1-5 And the famine grew more serious in the land. And it happened, when they had finished eating the corn which they had brought from Egypt, that their father said to them, 
Turn back, buy a little food for us. And Judah said to him - he said, The man issued a solemn warning to us, saying, You will not see my face unless your brother is with you. If you are willing to 
send our brother with us, we will go down and buy food for you. And if you are not willing to send him, we will not go down; for the man said to us, You will not see my face unless your brother is with 
you.  </p>
<p>'And the famine grew more serious' means the desolation resulting from the dearth of spiritual things. 'In the land' means in the case of the integral parts of the Church. 'And it happened' 
means a new situation. 'When they had finished eating the corn' means when there was a deficiency of truths. 'Which they had brought from Egypt' means which had been obtained from factual knowledge. 
'That their father said to them' means a perception received from the things that constituted the Church. 'Turn back, buy a little food for us' means that, so as to have life, they should acquire the 
good of spiritual truth. 'And Judah said to him' means the good which existed in the Church. 'He said, The man issued a solemn warning to us' means the turning away from them of the spiritual from the 
internal. 'Saying, You will not see my face' means that no compassion will show itself. 'Unless your brother is with you means unless the intermediary is with you. 'If you are willing to send our brother 
with us' means if the Church desires a linking to take place, the intermediary must be there. 'We will go down and buy food for you' means that in this case the good of truth will be acquired. 'And 
if you are not willing to send him' means if that is not so. 'We will not go down' means that it cannot be acquired. 'For the man said to us' means a perception regarding the spiritual. 'You will not 
see my face' means that no compassion will show itself. 'Unless your brother is with you' means unless the intermediary is with you. </p>

SENSUS INTERNUS   Vers. 1-5.  Et fames ingravescebat in terra. Et factum, sicut absolvissent comedere annonam, quam adduxerunt ex Aegypto, et dixit ad illos pater illorum, Revertimini, emite nobis 
parum cibi. Et dixit ad eum Jehudah, dicendo, Contestando contestatus in nos vir, dicendo, Non videbitis facies meas absque quod frater vester vobiscum. Si sis tu mittens fratrem nostrum nobiscum, descendemus 
et ememus tibi cibum. Et si non tu mittens, non descendemus, quia vir dixit ad nos, Non videbitis facies meas absque quod frater vester vobiscum. `Et fames ingravescebat' significat desolationem 
ex indigentia spiritualium: `in terra' significat circa illa quae erant Ecclesiae: `et factum' significat novum: `sicut absolvissent  comedere  annonam'  significat cum vera deficerent: `quam adduxerunt 
ex Aegypto' significat quae ex scientificis: `et dixit ad illos pater illorum' significat perceptionem ab illis quae Ecclesiae:  `Revertimini, emite nobis parum cibi' significat quod, ut vivant, 
comparent sibi bonum veri spiritualis: `et dixit ad eum Jehudah' significat bonum Ecclesiae: `dicendo, Contestando contestatus in nos vir' significat quod illis aversum spirituale ab interno: `dicendo, 
Non videbitis facies meas' significat quod nulla commiseratio: `absque quod frater vester vobiscum' significat nisi sit medium vobis: `si sis tu mittens fratrem nostrum nobiscum' significat si ita 
ab Ecclesia sit ut adjungatur quod erit medium: `descendemus et ememus tibi cibum' significat quod tunc ibi comparabitur bonum veri: `et si non tu mittens significat si non: `non descendemus' significat 
quod comparari nequeat: `quia vir dixit ad nos' significat perceptionem de spirituali: `Non videbitis facies meas' significat quod nulla commiseratio: `absque quod frater vester vobiscum' significat 
nisi sit medium vobis. </p>
