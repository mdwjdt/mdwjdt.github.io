<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10522</strong>.由此明显可知，当一个人拿饼，就是主的身体时，他便通过从祂所获得的对祂的爱之良善与祂结合；当此人拿酒，也就是主的血时，他便通过从祂所获得的对祂的信之良善与祂结合。但要知道，人们只有拥有从主所获得的对主的爱之良善和对主的信之良善在自己里面，才能通过圣餐礼与主结合。圣餐是这种结合的标志和印记。</p>

From all this it is evident that when a man takes the bread, which is the body, he is conjoined with the Lord through the good of love to Him from Him; and when he takes  </p>
<p>the wine, which is the blood, 
he is conjoined with the Lord through the good of faith to Him from Him. But be it known that conjunction with the Lord through the sacrament of the Supper is effected solely with those who are in 
the good of love and of faith to the Lord from the Lord. The Holy Supper is the seal of this conjunction.            EXODUS 33 </p>
<p>     1. And Jehovah spoke unto Moses, Go, go up from hence, thou and 
the people which thou hast made to come up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land of which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, To thy seed will I give it; </p>
<p>     2. And I will send 
an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; </p>
<p>     3. Unto a land flowing with milk and honey; for I will 
not go up in the midst of thee; because thou art a stiffnecked people. Perchance I should consume thee in the way.      4. And the people heard this evil word, and they mourned; and they put not any 
man his ornament upon him.      5. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto the sons of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people; I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and will consume thee; therefore 
now bring down thine ornaments from upon thee, and I shall know what I will do to thee.      6. And the sons of Israel stripped themselves of their ornament, by Mount Horeb.      7. And Moses 
took a tent, and stretched it for himself without the camp, afar off from the camp; and he called it the tent of meeting. And it was that everyone requiring of Jehovah went out unto the tent of meeting 
that was outside the camp.      8. And it was that when Moses went out unto the tent, all the people rose up, and stood every man at the door of his tent, and looked after Moses, until he had entered 
into the tent.      9. And it was that when Moses entered into the tent, the pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the door of the tent, and spoke with Moses.      10. And all the people saw the 
pillar of cloud standing at the door of the tent; and all the people rose up and bowed themselves, every man at the door of his tent.      11. And Jehovah spoke unto Moses faces to faces, as a man 
speaketh unto his neighbor. And he returned unto the camp; and his minister Joshua the son of Nun, a boy, moved not out of the midst of the tent.      12. And Moses said unto Jehovah, See, Thou sayest 
unto me, Make this people come up; and Thou hast not made known to me whom Thou wilt send with me. And Thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in Mine eyes.      13. And 
now I pray, if I have found grace in Thine eyes, make known to me I pray Thy way, that I may know Thee, because I have found grace in Thine eyes; and see that this nation is Thy people.      14. And 
He said, My faces shall go, and I will make thee to rest.      15. And he said unto Him, If Thy faces go not, do not make us go up from hence.      16. And wherein shall it ever become known that 
I have found grace in Thine eyes, I and Thy people? is it not in Thy going with us? And we shall be rendered pre-eminent, I and Thy people, above all the people that are upon the faces of the ground.  
    17. And Jehovah said unto Moses, I will do this word also that thou hast spoken; because thou hast found grace in Mine eyes, and I know thee by name.      18. And he said, Make me see, I pray, 
Thy glory.      19. And He said, I will make all My good pass by over thy faces, and will call on the name of Jehovah before thee; and I will show grace to whom I show grace, and I will show mercy to 
whom I show mercy.      20. And He said, Thou canst not see My faces; because a man shall not see Me and live.      21. And Jehovah said, Behold a place with Me, and thou shalt stand upon the rock; </p>
<p> 
    22. And it shall be when My glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover the palm of My hand over thee, until I have passed by.      23. And I will remove the 
palm of My hand, and thou shalt see My back parts; and My faces shall not be seen. </p>

From all this it is evident that when the person takes the bread, which is the Lord's body, he is joined to Him through the good of love to Him received from Him; and when the person takes the wine, 
which is the Lord's blood, he is joined to Him through the good of faith in Him received from Him. But it should be remembered that people are joined to the Lord through the sacrament of His Supper only 
if they have within themselves the good of love to the Lord and the good of faith in Him, which they have received from Him. The Holy Supper is the sign and seal of that joining together.  </p>

Ex his patet quod homo cum sumit panem, qui est corpus, conjungatur Domino per bonum amoris in Ipsum ab Ipso; et cum sumit vinum quod est sanguis, conjungatur Domino per bonum fidei in Ipsum ab Ipso. 
 Sed sciendum est quod conjunctio cum Domino per sacramentum Cenae fiat solum apud illos qui in bono amoris et fidei in Dominum a Domino sunt.  Sancta Cena est sigillum illius conjunctionis. </p>

                           CAPUT XXXIII 1.  Et locutus est JEHOVAH ad Moschen, Vade, ascende abhinc, tu et populus quem ascendere fecisti e terra Aegypti, ad terram quam juravi Abrahamo, Jischako, et 
Jacobo, dicendo, Semini tuo dabo illam. 2.  Et mittam ante te angelum, et expellam Canaanitam, Emoritam, et Chittitam, et Perisitam, Chivitam, et Jebusitam. 3.  Ad terram fluentem lacte et melle, quia 
non ascendam in medio tui, quia populus durus cervice tu, forte consumpsero te in via. 4.  Et audivit populus verbum malum hoc, et luxerunt, et non posuerunt aliquis (x)ornatum suum super se. 5. 
 Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Moschen, Dic ad filios Israelis, Vos populus durus cervice, momento uno ascendero in medio tui, et consumpsero te; et nunc descendere fac ornatum tuum desuper te, et cognoscam quid 
faciam tibi. 6.  Et abripuerunt filii Israelis ornatum suum, a monte Choreb. 7.  Et Moscheh accepit tentorium, et tetendit sibi extra castra, elongando a castris, et vocavit illud tentorium conventus; 
et fuit, omnis interrogans JEHOVAM exivit ad tentorium conventus quod extra castra. 8.  Et fuit, cum exivit Moscheh ad tentorium, surrexerunt omnis populus, et steterunt quisque ad ostium tentorii 
ejus, et spectarunt post Moschen usque ad intrare illum in tentorium. 9.  Et fuit, cum intravit Moscheh tentorium, descendit columna nubis, et stetit ad ostium tentorii, et loquebatur cum Moscheh. 10. 
 Et vidit omnis populus columnam nubis stantem ad ostium tentorii, et surrexit omnis populus, et incurvaverunt se quisque ad ostium tentorii ejus. 11.  Et locutus est JEHOVAH ad Moschen facies 
ad facies, quemadmodum loquitur vir ad proximum suum; et reversus est ad castra, et minister ejus Jehoschua filius Nunis puer non emovit se e medio tentorii. 12.  Et dixit Moscheh ad JEHOVAM, Vide, 
Tu dicis ad me, Ascendere fac populum hunc, et Tu non notum fecisti mihi quem missurus es cum me, et Tu dixisti, Novi te nomine, et quoque invenisti gratiam in oculis Meis. 13.  Et nunc si quaeso inveni 
gratiam in oculis Tuis, (x)notam fac mihi quaeso viam Tuam, et cognoscam Te, quoniam inveni gratiam in oculis Tuis, et vide quod populus Tuus gens haec. 14.  Et dixit, Facies Meae ibunt, et quiescere 
faciam te. 15.  Et dixit ad Ipsum, Si non facies Tuae euntes, ne ascendere facias nos abhinc. 16.  Et in quo notum fiet usquam quod invenerim gratiam in oculis Tuis, ego et populus Tuus, nonne 
in eundo Te cum nobis?  et praestantes reddemur ego et populus Tuus prae omni populo qui super faciebus humi. 17.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Moschen, Etiam verbum hoc quod locutus es faciam, quia invenisti 
gratiam in oculis Meis, et cognosco te nomine. 18.  Et dixit, Fac videre mihi quaeso gloriam Tuam. 19.  Et dixit, Ego pertransire faciam omne bonum Meum super facies tuas, et invocabo nomen JEHOVAE 
coram te, et gratiam faciam cui gratiam facio, et misericordiam faciam cui misericordiam facio. 20.  Et dixit, Non potes videre facies Meas, quia non videt Me homo et vivit. 21.  Et dixit JEHOVAH, 
Ecce locus Mecum, et stabis super petra. 22.  Et erit, in pertransire gloriam Meam, et ponam te in fissura petrae, et obtegam volam Meam super te, usque dum pertransivero. 23.  Et removebo volam Meam, 
et videbis posteriora Mea, et facies Meae non videbuntur. </p>
