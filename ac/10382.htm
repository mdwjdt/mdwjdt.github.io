<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10382</strong>.后来，我与那些保持一定距离的灵人交谈，问他们当中的坏人是什么情况。他们说，在他们星球上，任何人都不允许作恶；如果有人真的思想并做出恶事，他就会遭到某个灵人的斥责；如果他坚持这样做，这个灵人就会用死亡来威胁他。他若还坚持，就会昏厥而死；这个星球上的人以这种方式受到保护，免遭邪恶的污染。这种灵人当中有一个被送到我这里，像与恶人那样和我交谈。此外，他还在我的腹部造成一定程度的疼痛，他和我说话，就像和他们说话一样；此外，他还在我的腹部造成某种疼痛，声称他就是如此对待那些思想并做出恶事之人的；他还用死亡威胁他们。不过，这个灵人是一个斥责灵；他站在我脑后，从那里用一种像波浪一样起伏的声音向我说话。</p>

I afterward spoke with these spirits at a distance; and I asked what became of those among them who are evil. They said that on their earth it is not allowable to be wicked; but that if anyone thinks 
and does what is evil, he is chided by a certain spirit who threatens him with death if he persists in so doing; and if he still persists, he dies by a swoon; and by this means the men of that earth 
are preserved from the contagion of evils. A certain spirit of this kind was sent to me, speaking with me as he does with them; and he also induced somewhat of pain in the region of the abdomen, saying 
that he does so to those who think and do what is evil, and whom he threatens with death. But this spirit was a chiding spirit. He stood behind my head, and from thence talked with me in a vibratory way. </p>

Afterwards I spoke to those spirits who were keeping themselves at a distance, asking them what happens to those among them who are bad. They said that on their planet no one is allowed to be wicked; 
but if anyone does contemplate and do what is evil he is rebuked by a certain spirit who threatens him with death if he continues in such ways. If he does continue in them, they said, he has a fainting 
fit from which he dies; and in this way people on that planet are protected from the contamination of evils. A certain spirit of their kind was sent to me, who spoke to me as he would have done to 
them, in addition to which he caused some sort of pain in the area of my abdomen, saying that he did this kind of thing to those who contemplate and do what is evil, and threatened them with death. But 
this spirit was a rebuking spirit; he stood at the back of my head, and spoke to me from there with a voice which rose and fell like waves.  </p>

Postea locutus sum cum spiritibus illis ad distantiam, et quaesivi quid fit cum illis qui apud eos mali sunt; dicebant quod in tellure {1}illorum non liceat improbum esse, at si quis male cogitat et 
male facit, quod increpetur a spiritu quodam, qui ei denuntiat mortem, si in illis persistit; et quoque si persistit quod moriatur per deliquium; et quod hoc modo homines illius telluris conserventur 
a contagiis malorum. Quidam talis spiritus ad me missus est, mecum loquens sicut cum illis; ac insuper inducebat regioni abdominis aliquid doloris, dicens quod sic faciat illis qui male cogitant et male 
faciunt, et quibus denuntiat mortem. Sed hic spiritus erat spiritus increpator; adstitit ad occipitium, et inde mecum loquebatur undulatorie. @1 eorum T$ </p>
