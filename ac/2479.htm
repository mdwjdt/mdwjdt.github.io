<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2479节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2479.</strong>有一个新来的灵人很生气，因为他想不起自己活在肉身时所知道的很多事，并为所失去的快乐而悲伤，他曾在其中得到莫大乐趣。但他被告知，其实他什么也没失去，而且仍知道他所曾知道的一切；然而，在来世，他不可以提取这类事。他现在能更好、更完美地思考和言谈，而不是象以前那样，将他的理性沉浸于在他现在所进入的国度中一点用处也没有的稠密、模糊、物质和肉体之物，就足够了。至于存在于尘世国度中的事物，他被告知，这些东西都被遗留在尘世，他现在所拥有的一切，都适合永生之用；只有这样他才能变得幸福快乐。因此，认为在不用肉体记忆的来世聪明会消失，是无知的结果。然而，真相却是，心智越从感官或肉体之物中退出，就越被提升到属灵和属天之物那里。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2479</b></p><p><b>2479.</b>
A certain newly arrived spirit was indignant that he did not remember many things which he knew in the life of the body, grieving on account of the delight which he had lost, and with which he had been 
very greatly pleased. But he was told that he had lost nothing at all, and that he knew everything he had known; but that in the other life it is not permitted to draw forth such things; and that it 
is sufficient that he is now able to think and speak much better and more perfectly, without immersing his rational as before in dense, obscure, material, and corporeal things which are of no use in 
the kingdom into which he has now come; and that the things which were in the kingdom of the world had been left behind; and that he now has whatever conduces to the use of eternal life; and that thus 
and not otherwise can he become blessed and happy; thus that it is a result of ignorance to believe that in the other life intelligence perishes with the disuse of the corporeal memory; when yet the 
case is that insofar as the mind can be withdrawn from sensuous or corporeal things, so far is it elevated to spiritual and heavenly things. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2479</b></p><p><b>2479.</b>
A certain person who had recently become a spirit was angry because he could not remember many of the things he had known during his lifetime. He grieved for the delight which he had now lost and in 
which he had taken very great pleasure. But he was told that he had lost absolutely nothing and still knew every single one of them, but that in the next life he was not allowed to summon such things 
up. It was sufficient that he was now able to think and speak far better and more perfectly and was unable to submerge the rational side of himself, as had happened previously, in dense, obscure, material, 
and bodily things which were of no use in the kingdom he had now entered. As for the things that existed in the kingdom of the world he was told that they were left behind, and that now he possessed 
whatever was suited to use in eternal life and that he could become blessed and happy in no other way. Thus anybody is wanting in knowledge who believes that in the next life, where the physical 
memory is not used, intelligence ceases. The reality is that to the extent the mind can be drawn from sensory and bodily interests it is lifted up to spiritual and celestial things. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2479</b>
</p><b>2479.</b>
Quidam recens spiritus, indignatus quod non meminisset plurium quae in vita corporis novit, dolens ob jucundum quod amisit, quo maxime delectatus fuerat; sed dictum ei quod prorsus nihil amiserit, et 
quod sciat omnia et singula, sed quod in altera vita non liceat ei talia depromere; et quod satis sit quod nunc possit multo melius et perfectius cogitare et loqui, nec rationale suum immergere, ut 
prius, densis obscuris, materialibus et corporei quae nullius usus sunt in regno in quod nunc venit, et quod illa quae in regno mundi fuerunt, relicta sint, et nunc habeat quicquid ad usum vitae aeternae 
conducat, et quod sic non aliter possit beatus et felix fieri: ita quod ignorantiae sit credere quod in altera vita cum non usurpatione memoriae corporea intelligentia pereat, cum tamen ita se habet 
quod quantum abduci potest memoriae a sensualibus et corporeis, tantum elevetur ad spiritualia et caelestia. </p>
