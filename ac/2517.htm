<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2517节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2517.</strong>“她是嫁了丈夫的”表正信的教义是属灵的，其内容与属天之物结合在一起。这从“嫁了丈夫的”的含义清楚可知。当圣言中提及“丈夫”这个词时，它表示良善，“妻子”表示真理。当这个丈夫被称为“男人”时，情况则不然，因为这时“男人”表示真理，妻子表示良善（参看<a href="915.htm">915</a>节）。故此处“她是嫁了丈夫的”表示那真理与良善结合在一起，真理以这种方式也是良善。这同样从作为妻子的“撒拉”和“亚伯拉罕”的含义清楚可知：作为妻子的“撒拉”是指属灵的真理，而“亚伯拉罕”是指属天的良善，这二者都是神性（参看<a href="2501.htm">2501</a>，<a href="2507.htm">2507</a>节）。由于“撒拉”表神性属灵真理，故正信的教义本身也由“他的妻子撒拉”来表示，因为教义来自真理。由此明显可知，“嫁了丈夫的”表示正信的教义是属灵的，其内容与属天之物结合在一起。</p>

For she is married to a husband. That this signifies that the doctrine of true faith is spiritual, and that its contents are conjoined with the celestial, is evident from the signification of being "married 
to a husband." "Husband," when mentioned in the Word, signifies good, and "wife" then signifies truth. It is otherwise when the husband is called the "man;" for then "man" signifies truth, and 
"wife" good (see n. 915, and elsewhere). Here therefore her being "married to a husband" signifies that truth is conjoined with good, and in such a manner that the truth also is good. The same is also 
evident from the signification of "Sarah as a wife," as being spiritual truth, and of "Abraham," as being celestial good, both Divine (see n. 2501, 2507). And as "Sarah" signifies Divine spiritual truth, 
the doctrine itself of true faith is also meant by "Sarah a wife;" for the doctrine is from truths. It is plain from this that her being "married to a husband" means that the doctrine of true faith 
is spiritual, and that its contents are conjoined with the celestial. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2517</b></p><p><b>2517.</b>
'She is married to a husband' means that the doctrine of true faith is spiritual and the contents of it are joined to the celestial. This is clear from the meaning of 'married to a husband'. When the 
expression 'husband' is used in the Word it means good, and 'wife' means truth. It is different when the husband is called 'man'. In this case 'men' means truth and 'wife' good, see <a href="915.htm">915</a> and elsewhere. 
Here therefore 'married to a husband' means that truth has been joined to good, so that the truth also is good. This is clear in addition from the meaning of 'Sarah his wife' as spiritual truth, and 
of 'Abraham' as celestial good, both of which are Divine, dealt with in <a href="2501.htm">2501</a>, <a href="2507.htm">2507</a>. And because 'Sarah' means Divine spiritual truth, the doctrine itself of true faith is also meant by 'Sarah his wife', 
for doctrine is obtained from truths. From this it is evident that 'married to a husband' means that the doctrine of true faith is spiritual and the contents of it are joined to the celestial. </p>

Quod `illa maritata marito' significet quod doctrina verae fidei spiritualis sit, et quae ibi, conjuncta caelesti, constat (c)a significatione `maritari marito'; `maritus' cum nominatur in Verbo, significat 
bonum, et tunc `uxor' verum, secus `dum maritus vocatur vir; tunc `vir' significat verum, et `Uxor' bonum, videatur n. 915, et alibi; hic ideo `maritata marito' significat quod verum sit conjunctum 
bono, ita ut quoque verum sit bonum: constat etiam ex significatione `Sarae uxoris' quod sit verum spirituale, et `Abrahami' quod sit bonum caeleste, utrumque Divinum, de qua n. 2501, 2507; et 
quia `Sarah' significat verum spirituale Divinum, ipsa doctrina verae fidei' etiam per `Saram uxorem' intelligitur, nam doctrina est ex veris: inde patet quod `maritata marito' sit quod doctrina verae 
fidei spiritualis sit, et quae ibi, conjuncta caelesti. 	@1 i ac.$ 	@2 i quae spiritualis.$ </p>
