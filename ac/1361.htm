<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1361.</strong>这个教会由于偶像崇拜而变得具有代表性。没人知道这一事实，除非他知道何为代表物。在犹太教会和圣言中，所代表的事物都是主及其国，因而是爱的属天事物和信的属灵事物：这些就是所代表的事物，此外还有属于这些的许多事物，如教会的一切事物。那些作为代表物的，要么是人，要么是这个世界或地上的事物；总之，就是系感官物体的所有事物，以致没有一个物体不能成为一个代表物。然而，代表的一般法则是，不要关注代表的人或物，而要关注所代表的实际对象本身。<br />例如，犹大和以色列，甚至埃及以及别处的每个国王，无论他是谁，都能代表主。他们的王权本身就是具有代表性的事物。因此，所有国王中最坏的也能作为代表，如派约瑟治理埃及地的法老，巴比伦的尼布甲尼撒（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.37.htm">2:37</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.38.htm">38</a>），扫罗，以及犹大和以色列的其他国王，无论他们具有何种秉性。膏油本身（他们由此被称为耶和华的受膏者）具有代表性。所有祭司，无论他们有多少，同样都代表主；祭司职责本身是具有代表性的事物；邪恶和不洁的祭司也是；因为在代表物中要关注的不是行代表的这个人的品性。不仅人类，动物也具有代表性，如用于献祭的所有动物；羔羊和绵羊代表属天事物，鸽子和斑鸠代表属灵事物；同样，公绵羊、公山羊、小公牛和公牛代表低级的属天和属灵之物。<br />如前所述，具有代表性的，不仅包括有生命之物，还包括无生命的物体，如祭坛、甚至祭坛上的石头；以及约柜、会幕及其中的一切；众所周知的神殿及其中的一切，如灯台、饼、亚伦的衣服。除了这些事物外，犹太教会的一切仪式也具有代表性。在古教会，代表物涉及一切感官物体，如大山小冈、山谷、平原、河流、小溪、泉水、水池，总体的森林、树林和具体的每棵树，以致每种树都有某种确定的含义；后来，当有重要意义的教会终结时，这些事物就变成代表物。由此可见何谓代表物。由于不仅人类，无论是谁，品性如何，而且动物、甚至无生命的物体，都能代表属天、属灵之物，就是那些属于主在天堂的国度之物和那些属于主在地上的国度之物，所以显而易见何为代表性教会。<br />代表物具有这样的功效：凡按仪式规定所执行的一切在灵人和天使面前都显为圣洁。例如，大祭司在用水清洗自己、穿上主教服、站在点燃的蜡烛前之时，无论他是哪种人，哪怕内心是最无德的偶像崇拜者。其他祭司也一样，因为如前所述，在代表物中，不要关注这个人，而要关注所代表的实际事物本身。这种实际物完全从这个人抽象出来，如从献祭的公牛、小公牛、羔羊，或祭坛周围所洒的血，亦或祭坛本身等抽象出来一样。<br />在一切内在敬拜都丧失，敬拜不仅完全变得外在，甚至成了偶像崇拜后，代表性教会就开始建立，以便天与地能有某种结合，即主可以藉着天堂与人类结合。藉着敬拜的内在事物的结合消亡后，这种结合随之而来。至于这种唯独藉着代表物的结合是何性质，蒙主怜悯，以后再讨论。代表物要等到下一章才开始，自下章起，一切事物，无论总体还是细节，都是纯粹的代表物。此刻所论述的主题是那些作为其祖先之人的状态，也就是其中一些人及其后代变成代表物之前的状态。前面说过，他们的敬拜都是偶像崇拜。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1361.</strong> Idolatry turned the church into a representative religion, but no one can see this without knowing what it means to be representative. What was represented in the Jewish religion and what is represented in the Word are the Lord and his kingdom and therefore the heavenly qualities of love and the spiritual properties of faith. These and many other things related to them are what is being represented, as is everything having to do with religion.<br />The things that represent them are either people or various objects that exist in the world or on earth — in short, everything that is perceptible to the senses. In fact there is hardly any perceptible thing that cannot serve a representative role.<br />A general rule of representation, however, is that it implies nothing about the person or thing that does the representing, only about the phenomenon represented.<br />[2] For example, every monarch, no matter who it was — in Judah or Israel, even in Egypt and elsewhere — was able to represent the Lord. The monarchy itself of these people was representative. So the Lord could be represented by the worst sovereign of all, such as the pharaoh who set Joseph up over the land of Egypt, or Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1361/bible_king-james-version_daniel_2_37-38" target=_top>Daniel 2:37-38</a>), or Saul, or the other monarchs of Judah and Israel, whatever they were like. Their actual anointing (because of which they were referred to as "Jehovah's anointed") involved this representation.{*1} All the priests without exception similarly represented the Lord. Priesthood itself is representative. Priests who were evil and impure represented the Lord as well, because with representative roles there is no implication concerning the character of the actual person.<br />Not only people played a representative role but animals too, such as all the sacrificial ones. Lambs and sheep represented heavenly qualities; pigeons and turtledoves represented spiritual ones. Rams, he-goats, young cattle, and adult cattle did too, but the heavenly and spiritual qualities they represented were of a lower order.<br />[3] What is more, not only animate beings played a representative role, as noted, but inanimate objects too. Examples are the altar and even the altar stones, the ark and the tabernacle with all that was in it, the Temple with all that was in it as well (as anyone can recognize), and so the lamps, the loaves of bread, and Aaron's garments.{*2} And not only were these items representative but all the rituals of the Jewish religion were too.<br />In the ancient churches, [which were steeped in symbolism,] symbolic items{*3} included all the objects of the senses, such as mountains and hills; valleys, plains, rivers, brooks, springs, and wells; groves of trees; trees in general; and every tree in particular, to the point where each individual tree meant something specific. Later, when the symbolic church ended, such objects became representative. These remarks show what "representative objects" means.<br />Again, not only humans — without regard to their identity or character — but also animals and inanimate objects were capable of representing heavenly and spiritual attributes (that is, attributes of the Lord's kingdom in the heavens and of the Lord's kingdom on earth). And from this, one can deduce what a representative church is.<br />[4] Because of the way the representative relationship worked, any activity that met the requirements laid down for ritual appeared holy in the eyes of spirits and angels. This was true, for instance, when the high priest washed with water, wore the priestly garb as he ministered, and stood in front of the burning lamps. It did not matter what he was like, even if he was extremely impure and an idolater at heart. The same was true for the other priests as well. To repeat, when it comes to representative items, they imply nothing about the actual person, only about the quality itself that is being represented, in complete isolation from the person. The quality is just as separate from the person as it was from the adult cattle, young cattle, and lambs that were sacrificed, or from the blood that was poured out around the altar, or from the altar itself, and so on.<br />[5] This representative religion was established after all inward worship had died out and become not merely shallow but even idolatrous. It was established in order to maintain some connection between heaven and earth, or rather between the Lord and humankind through heaven. This occurred after the bond created by the deeper elements of worship had broken. However, the nature of this connection created only by representative elements will be told later [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1361/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3478" target=_top>3478-3480</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1361/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4311" target=_top>4311</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1361/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_8588#subsection-2-5" target=_top>8588:5-6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1361/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_8788" target=_top>8788</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1361/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_9457" target=_top>9457</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1361/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_9481" target=_top>9481</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1361/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_10500" target=_top>10500</a>], by the Lord's divine mercy.<br />Representative meanings do not start till the next chapter, but each and every detail from there on is purely representative. The present verse deals with the circumstances of the forefathers before some of them (and their descendants) came to serve representative roles. The fact that they practiced idolatrous worship is shown above [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1361/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1358" target=_top>1358</a>].<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the anointing of sacred persons, see note 3 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1361/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1001" target=_top>1001</a>.

That from being idolatrous the church became representative, no one can know unless he knows what a representative is. The things that were represented in the Jewish Church, and in the Word, are the 
Lord and His kingdom, consequently the celestial things of love, and the spiritual things of faith: these are what were represented, besides many things that pertain to these, such as all things that 
belong to the church. The representing objects are either persons or things that are in the world or upon the earth; in a word, all things that are objects of the senses, insomuch that there is scarcely 
any object that cannot be a representative. But it is a general law of representation that there is no reflection upon the person or upon the thing which represents, but only upon that thing itself 
which is represented. </p>
<p>[2] For example, every king, whoever he was, in Judah and Israel, and even in Egypt and elsewhere, could represent the Lord. Their royalty itself is what is representative. So 
that the worst of all kings could represent, such as the Pharaoh who set Joseph over the land of Egypt, Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon (Dan. 2:37-38), Saul, and the other kings of Judah and of Israel, of 
whatever character they were. The anointing itself-from which they were called Jehovah's anointed-involved this. In like manner all priests, how many soever they were, represented the Lord; the priestly 
function itself being what is representative; and so in like manner the priests who were evil and impure; because in representatives there is no reflection upon the person, in regard to what his quality 
is. And not only did men represent, but also beasts, such as all that were offered in sacrifice; the lambs and sheep representing celestial things; the doves and turtledoves, spiritual things; 
and in like manner the rams, goats, bullocks, and oxen represented lower celestial and spiritual things.  [3] And not only were animate things used as representatives, but also inanimate things, such 
as the altar and even the stones of the altar, the ark and the tabernacle with all that was in them, and, as everyone may know, the temple with all that was therein, such as the lamps, the breads, and 
the garments of Aaron. Nor these things only, but also all the rites in the Jewish Church were representative. In the Ancient Churches, representatives extended to all the objects of the senses, to 
mountains and hills, to valleys, plains, rivers, brooks, fountains, and pools, to groves and trees in general, and to every tree in particular, insomuch that each tree had some definite signification; 
all which, afterwards, when the significative church had ceased, were made representatives. From all this it may be seen what is meant by representatives. And as things celestial and spiritual-that is-the 
things of the Lord's kingdom in the heavens, and of the Lord's kingdom on earth could be represented not only by men, whosoever and of what quality soever they were, but also by beasts, and even 
by inanimate things, it may now be seen what a representative church is.  [4] The representatives were of such an efficacy that all things that were done according to the rites commanded appeared holy 
before the spirits and angels, as for instance when the high priest washed himself with water, when he ministered clothed in his pontifical garments, when he stood before the burning lights, no matter 
what kind of man he was, even if most impure, and in his heart an idolater. The case was the same with all the other priests. For, as before said, in representatives the person was not reflected upon, 
but only the thing itself that was represented, quite abstractly from the person, as it was abstractly from the oxen, the bullocks, and the lambs that were sacrificed, or from the blood that was 
poured round about the altar, and also abstractly from the altar itself; and so on. [5] This representative church was instituted-after all internal worship was lost, and when worship had become not 
only merely external, but also idolatrous-in order that there might be some conjunction of heaven with earth, that is, of the Lord through heaven with man, even after the conjunction by the internal things 
of worship had perished. But what kind of conjunction this is by representatives alone, shall of the Lord's Divine mercy be told in what follows. Representatives do not begin until the following 
chapter; in which, and in those that follow, all things in general and in particular are purely representative. Here, the subject treated of is the state of those who were the fathers, before certain 
of them and their descendants became representative; and it has been shown above that they were in idolatrous worship. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1361</b></p><p><b>1361.</b>
The fact that the Church became representative as the result of idolatry nobody is able to know unless he knows what a representative is. The things that were represented in the Jewish Church, and in 
the Word, are the Lord and His kingdom, and therefore the celestial things of love and the spiritual things of faith. These are the things that are represented, in addition to many things that go with 
them, such as everything belonging to the Church. Those that represent are either persons or else things in the universe or on this earth; in short, all things that are objects of the senses, so much 
so that scarcely any object is incapable of being representative. It is a general law of representation however that no attention is paid to the representative person or thing, but to the actual subject 
being represented. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 For example: Every king who has lived - in Judah or Israel, or even in Egypt and elsewhere - could represent the Lord Their royal status itself is representative, and thus 
the worst king of all was able to represent Him, such as the Pharaoh who promoted Joseph over the land of Egypt, or Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%202:37,%2038&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 2:37, 38</a>, or Saul and all the other kings of Judah 
and Israel, no matter what kind of men they were. The anointing of them, by virtue of which they were called 'Jehovah's anointed', carried that representation with it. In the same way all priests, however 
many there were, represented the Lord. Their priestly status itself is representative. This applies even to priests who were evil and immoral, for in representatives no attention is paid to the 
character of the person involved. And not only human beings but also animals were representative, for example all those used in sacrifice. Lambs and sheep represented celestial things, doves and turtle 
doves spiritual, as did rams, he-goats, young bulls, and oxen, though these latter represented lower types of celestial and spiritual things. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Nor, as has been stated, was it just living creatures 
that were representative but also inanimate objects, such as the altar and even the stones of the altar; also the Ark and the Tabernacle together with everything in it; and the Temple too together 
with everything in it, a fact that anyone is capable of seeing. The lamps, the loaves, and Aaron's garments were accordingly representative. And not only these but also all the religious ceremonies 
in the Jewish Church. In the Ancient Churches representatives extended to every object of the senses, such as mountains and hills, and valleys, plains, rivers, streams, springs, reservoirs, woods, trees 
in general, and every kind of tree in particular, so that every single tree had some definite meaning. Once the Church of meaningful signs had come to an end these things became representatives. These 
considerations make clear what is to be understood by representatives. And seeing that not only human beings, no matter who or of what character, but also animals and even inanimate objects, could 
represent celestial and spiritual things - which are things belonging to the Lord's kingdom in heaven and those belonging to the Lord's kingdom on earth - it is consequently clear what a representative 
Church is. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Representatives were such that to spirits and angels all things that were carried out according to the prescribed ritual appeared holy, as when the high priest, who had washed himself 
with water, ministered dressed in the robes of his office, and stood before the lighted candles, no matter what kind of man he was, even the most immoral and an idolater at heart. And the same applied 
to all other priests, for, as has been stated, in representatives no attention is paid to the person, but only to the actual thing being represented. The representation was completely abstracted 
from the person, as it was from the oxen, young bulls, or lambs that were sacrificed, or from the blood that was poured out around the altar, or again from the altar itself, and so on. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 This representative 
Church was established after all internal worship had perished, when worship became not only wholly external but also idolatrous It was established so that heaven might be joined in some 
measure to the earth, that is, the Lord might be joined to human beings by means of heaven. And this came about after conjunction by means of the internal things of worship had perished. The nature of 
this conjunction by means of representatives alone will in the Lord's Divine mercy be discussed later on. Representatives do not start until the next chapter, where every single thing from then on is 
purely representative. At the moment the subject is the state of those who were their forefathers, before some of them and their descendants became representative, whose worship, as shown above, was 
idolatrous. </p>

</p><b>1361.</b>
Quod ex idololatria Ecclesia repraesentativa facta sit, nullus scire potest nisi sciat quid repraesentativum est; quae in Ecclesia Judaica repraesentabantur, et quae in Verbo, est Dominus, ac Ipsis 
regnum, proinde caelestia amoris, et spiritualia fidei; haec sunt quae repraesentantur, praeter plura quae ad illa pertinent, sicut omnia quae sunt Ecclesiae:  repraesentantes sunt vel personae, vel res 
quae sunt in mundo aut super tellure, verbo omnia quae sunt objecta sensuum, usque adeo ut vix aliquid objectum sit quod non repraesentativum esse possit:  sed generalis lex repraesentationis est quod 
nihil reflectatur super personam aut super rem quae repraesentat, sed super illud ipsum quod repraesentatur; ut pro exemplo:  [2] omnis rex quicumque fuit, in Juda et Israele, immo in Aegypto, et 
alibi, potuit repraesentare Dominum; ipsum regium eorum est repraesentativum; ita potuit rex omnium pessimus, sicut Pharaoh qui erexit Josephum super terram Aegypti; Nebuchadnezzar in Babele, Dan. ii 
37, 38, Saul et ceteri reges Jehudae et Israelis, qualescumque fuerunt; ipsa unctio, unde appellati uncti Jehovae, hoc involvit.  Similiter omnes sacerdotes quotcumque fuerunt, repraesentabant Dominum; 
ipsum sacerdotale est repraesentativum; sacerdotes qui fuerunt mali et immundi, similiter; quia in repraesentativis nihil reflectebatur super personam qualis fuit.  Nec solum homines repraesentabant 
sed etiam bestiae, sicut omnes quae sacrificabantur; 'agni et oves' repraesentabant caelestia, 'columbae et turtures' spiritualia; 'arietes, hirci, juvenci et boves' similiter sed caelestia et spiritualia 
inferiora.  [3] Nec solum animata, ut dictum, repraesentabant sed etiam inanimata, sicut altare, immo lapides altaris, tum arca et tentorium cum omnibus quae ibi, ut et templum cum omnibus quae 
ibi, quod cuivis notum esse potest; ita lucernae, panes, vestes Aharonis:  nec solum haec repraesentativa fuerunt sed etiam omnes ritus qui fuerunt in Ecclesia Judaica.  In Antiquis Ecclesiis repraesentativa 
se extendebant ad omnia objecta sensuum, sicut ad montes et colles, adque valles, planities, fluvios, rivos, fontes, cisternas, ad lucos, ad arbores in genere, et ad quamcumque arborem in specie, 
usque adeo ut unaquaevis arbor aliquid certum significaret, quae postea cum Ecclesia significativa cessavit, facta sunt repraesentativa; ex his constare potest quid per repraesentativa intelligatur: 
 et quia non solum per homines, quicumque et qualescumque essent sed etiam per bestias, tum etiam per inanimata, repraesentari potuerunt caelestia et spiritualia, illa nempe quae sunt regni Domini 
in caelis, et quae sunt regni Domini in terris, inde constat quid Ecclesia repraesentativa.  [4] Repraesentativa se habuerunt quod coram spiritibus et angelis apparerent omnia sancta quae fiebant secundum 
ritus mandatos, ut cum summus sacerdos lavasset se aquis, amictu pontificali indutus ministraret, coram candelis accensis staret, utcumque ille fuisset, etiam si vel immundissimus et corde suo idololatres; 
ita quoque ceteri sacerdotes; nam, sicut dictum, in repraesentativis non reflectebatur super personam sed super ipsum illud quod repraesentabatur, prorsus abstracte a persona, sicut abstracte 
a bovibus, juvencis, agnis quae sacrificabantur, aut a sanguine qui effundebatur circum altare, ut et abstracte ab ipso altari, et sic porro.  [5] Ecclesia haec repraesentativa instituta est postquam 
omnis cultus internus periit, et cum factus non solum mere externus sed etiam idololatricus, ob causam ut aliqua conjunctio caeli foret cum terra, seu Domini per caelum cum homine; et hoc postquam 
periit conjunctio per interna cultus:  sed qualis conjunctio haec sit per sola repraesentativa, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, dicetur in sequentibus.  Repraesentativa non prius incohantur quam in capite 
sequente, ubi omnia et singula quae ibi et in sequentibus, pure repraesentativa sunt:  hic agitur de statu illorum qui patres fuerunt, antequam quidam ex illis et posteri eorum repraesentativi facti, 
qui quod in idololatrico cultu fuerint, supra ostensum est. </p>
