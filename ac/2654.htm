<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2654节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2654.</strong>“戏笑”表不赞同或不支持神圣理性。这从“戏笑”的含义清楚可知，“戏笑”是违背不赞同或不支持人的自我之物的一种情感的产物。在前一节，经上说“孩子渐长，就断了奶，给以撒断奶的日子，亚伯拉罕设摆了盛大的筵席”，这句经文的意思是，当主的理性变成神性时，最初存在的理性就被分离出去。结果，紧接着经上就提到了表示第一理性的埃及人夏甲的儿子，这在前面有关创世记16章的解读中有所说明，那里论述的主题就是以实玛利和夏甲。由此也明显可知，在内义中的这些细节相继联结起来，成为一个连续的系列。<br />不过，就主的第一理性而言，它因和其他人的一样出生，也就是说，通过知识和认知出生，故不可避免地处于真理的表象中，而真理的表象本身并非真理，这一点从前面所示（<a href="1911.htm">1911</a>，<a href="1936.htm">1936</a>，<a href="2196.htm">2196</a>，<a href="2203.htm">2203</a>，<a href="2209.htm">2209</a>，<a href="2519.htm">2519</a>节）明显可知。并且，由于它处于真理的表象中，故如神性真理那样没有表象的真理无法赞同或支持它，既因第一理性无法理解它们，也因它们反对第一理性。下面举例说明。<br />人类理性，也就是通过经由感官印象所得来的世俗事物，以及后来凭借知识和认知对世俗事物的分析而形成的理性，若被告知，它并非靠<br />自己活着，只是看似靠自己活着，就会预备加以取笑或嘲弄。若被告知，人越不信他靠自己活着，就越真正地活着，即越有智慧聪明，也越幸福快乐，它也会嘲笑。若被告知，这就是天使，尤其那些属天和至内在的，或与主最接近的天使所拥有的生活，因为这些天使知道，没人能靠自己活着，唯独耶和华，就是主除外，它同样会嘲笑。<br />这理性若被告知，它没有任何属于自己的东西，它拥有自己的东西不过是一个错觉或表象，还是会嘲笑。若被告知，它越处于它拥有自己的东西这样的谬见中，它拥有的就越少，反之亦然，它尤其会嘲笑。同样，若被告知，凡它通过自己的东西所思所做的任何事都是邪恶，哪怕就效果而言，它是善的，还被告知，它没有任何智慧，除非它相信并发觉一切恶皆来自地狱，一切善皆来自主，它就会嘲笑。所有天使都具有这样的信仰，事实上具有这样的直觉；然而，他们仍拥有自我感，甚至比所有其他人都要丰富。不过，他们知道并发觉，其自我感来自主，尽管它完全看似他们自己的。<br />若被告知，在天堂，最大的是最小的；最有智慧的就是相信并发觉自己最没有智慧的；最快乐的就是想把最大的快乐给予他人，把最小的快乐给予自己的；天堂就在于想在所有人之下，而地狱则在于想在所有人之上；因此，天堂的荣耀中绝没有任何事物与这个世界的荣耀所具有的事物一样，这理性又会嘲笑。<br />若被告知，来世根本没有空间和时间，只有状态，那里有取决于状态的时空表象；生命越变得属天，它距离时空之物就越远，距离永恒之物则越近；因为永恒之物绝没有任何来自时间概念的事物，这理性照样会嘲笑。若被告知无数其它事，情形也一样。<br />主发现，这类事就存在于纯粹的人类理性中，人类理性因此会嘲笑神性事物。主通过神性属灵之物发现这一点，这就是“撒拉看见埃及人夏甲的儿子”所表示的（<a href="2651.htm">2651</a>，<a href="2652.htm">2652</a>节）。人能从内探究自己里面在下的事物，这一事实是那些拥有直觉的人，甚至那些拥有良知的人通过经验所熟知的。因为他们足以清楚地发现，他们会为自己的想法而感到自责。因此，重生之人能看到他们的理性在重生之前是何性质。对人来说，这种直觉来自主，而主的直觉则来自祂自己。</p>

Mocking. That this signifies not in agreement with or favoring the Divine rational, is evident from the signification of "mocking," as being that which comes of an affection contrary to what does not 
agree with and favor one's self. In the preceding verse it was said that the child grew, and was weaned, and that Abraham made a great feast when he weaned Isaac; by which is signified that when the 
Lord's rational was made Divine, the former rational was separated. Therefore there now immediately follows that which concerns the son of Hagar the Egyptian, by whom this rational is meant, as was shown 
in the explication at the sixteenth chapter, where Ishmael and Hagar are treated of. From this it is likewise manifest that the things which are in the internal sense follow together in a continuous 
series. [2] But in regard to the Lord's first rational, seeing that it was born as with another man, namely, by means of knowledges [per scientias et cognitiones], it could not but be in appearances 
of truth which are not truths in themselves, as is evident from what has been shown before (n. 1911, 1936, 2196, 2203, 2209, 2519); and as it was in appearances of truth, truths without appearances, 
such as Divine truths are, could not agree with it or favor it, both because this rational does not comprehend them, and because they oppose it. But take examples for illustration. [3] The human rational-that 
namely which has its birth* from worldly things through impressions of sense, and afterwards from analogies of worldly things by means of knowledges [per scientifica et cognitiones] - is ready 
to laugh and mock if told that it does not live of itself, but only appears to live so; and that one lives the more, that is, the more wisely and intelligently, and the more blissfully and happily, 
the less he believes that he lives of himself; and that this is the life of angels, especially of those who are celestial, and inmost, or nearest to the Lord; for they know that no one lives of himself 
except Jehovah alone, that is, the Lord. [4] This rational would mock also if it were told that it has nothing of its own, and that its having anything of its own is a fallacy or an appearance; 
and still more would it mock if told that the more it is in the fallacy that it has anything of its own, the less it has; and the converse. So too would it mock if told that whatever it thinks and does 
from what is its own is evil, although it were good; and that it is not wise until it believes and perceives that all evil is from hell, and all good from the Lord. In this belief, and even in this 
perception, are all the angels; who nevertheless have what is their own more abundantly than all others; but they know and perceive that this is from the Lord, although it altogether appears as theirs. [5] 
Again: this rational would mock if it were said that in heaven the greatest are they who are least, the wisest they who believe and perceive themselves to be the least wise, and the happiest they 
who desire others to be the most happy, and themselves the least so; that it is heaven to wish to be below all, but hell to wish to be above all; consequently that in the glory of heaven there is absolutely 
nothing the same as in the glory of the world. [6] In the same way would that rational mock, if it were said that in the other life there is nothing of space and time, but that there are states, 
according to which there are appearances of space and time; and that life is the more heavenly the further it is from what is of space and time, and the nearer it is to what is eternal; in which, 
namely, in what is eternal, there is nothing at all from the idea of time, nor from anything analogous to it: and so with numberless other things. [7] That there were such things in the merely human 
rational, and that therefore this rational mocked at Divine things, the Lord saw, and indeed from the Divine spiritual (which is signified by Sarah's seeing the son of Hagar the Egyptian, n. 2651, 2652). 
That man is able to look from within into the things in himself which are below, is known by experience to those who are in perception, and even to those who are in conscience; for they see so far 
as to reprove their very thoughts. Hence the regenerate can see what is the quality of the rational which they had before regeneration. With man such perception is from the Lord; but the Lord's was 
from Himself. * Natura, probably a misprint for natum. [Rotch ed.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2654</b></p><p><b>2654.</b>
'Mocking' means not in agreement with or favourably disposed towards the Divine Rational. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'mocking' as the product of an affection contrary to that which is not 
in agreement with or favourably disposed towards oneself. In the previous verse it was said that 'the boy grew and was weaned' and that 'Abraham made a great feast when he weaned Isaac', the meaning 
of which was that when the Lord's rational was made Divine the rational that existed first was separated. There now follows immediately therefore a reference to the son of Hagar the Egyptian, who is used 
to mean that first rational, as has been shown in the explanation of Chapter <a href="16.htm">16</a> where Ishmael and Hagar are the subject. From this it is also evident that the details in the internal sense follow, 
linked together in a continuous chain. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But as regards the Lord's first rational, because it was born as with any other, that is to say, by means of knowledge and cognitions, it was inevitably 
immersed in appearances of truth, which are not in themselves truths, as may become clear from what has been presented in <a href="1911.htm">1911</a>, <a href="1936.htm">1936</a>, <a href="2196.htm">2196</a>, <a href="2203.htm">2203</a>, <a href="2209.htm">2209</a>, <a href="2519.htm">2519</a>. And because it was immersed in appearances 
of truth, truths devoid of appearances, as Divine truths are, were not able to agree with it nor to be favourably disposed towards it, not only because that rational can have no grasp of them but also 
because they are opposed to it. Let the following examples illustrate the matter: </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The human rational - that is to say, the rational formed from images of worldly things received through the senses, 
and later on from images of things analogous to actual worldly ones, such as are received from factual knowledge and from cognitions - virtually laughs or mocks if it is told that it does not live 
of itself but only appears to itself to do so. It likewise laughs if it is told that the less anyone believes that he lives of himself, the more he is truly living, that is, the more wise and intelligent 
he is, and the more blessed and happy. And it also laughs if it is told that that life is the life which angels possess, especially those who are celestial and are inmost or nearest to the Lord; 
for these know that nobody except Jehovah alone, that is, the Lord, lives of himself. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 This rational would also mock if it were told that it has nothing of its own, and that its possessing anything 
of its own is an illusion or an appearance. Still more would it mock if it were told that the more it is subject to the illusion that it possesses anything of its own the less it in fact possesses, 
and vice versa. It would likewise mock if it were told that whatever it thinks and does from what is its own is evil, even though it was good [in its effect], and if it were told that it has no wisdom 
until it believes and perceives that all evil comes from hell and all good from the Lord. This is a conviction, indeed a perception, that exists in all angels, yet they possess selfhood or a proprium 
in fuller measure than all others. But they realize and perceive that their selfhood comes from the Lord, even though it seems to be completely their own. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 This rational would again mock if 
it were told that in heaven the greatest are those who are least; that the wisest are those who believe and perceive that they themselves are the least wise; that the happiest are those who wish the 
greatest happiness to others and the least to themselves; that heaven consists in wishing to be below everyone else, but hell in wishing to be above everyone else; and that consequently the glory of 
heaven does not hold within it anything at all of that which the glory of the world holds. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 This rational would similarly mock if it were told that in the next life space and time do not exist at 
all but states in accordance with which there are appearances of space and time, and that life becomes more heavenly the further removed it is from the things that belong to space and time and the closer 
it comes to that which is eternal - for that which is eternal has absolutely nothing within it that is received from the notion of time or anything analogous to it. In the same way would the rational 
mock at countless other things it could be told. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 The Lord saw that such things were present in the merely human rational and that this rational therefore mocked Divine things. He did so from 
the Divine spiritual, which is meant by the words 'Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian', <a href="2651.htm">2651</a>, <a href="2652.htm">2652</a>. The fact that a person is able from within to have insight into the things residing with him 
that are below is well known from experience to those who have perception, and also to those who have conscience, for they see clearly enough to reproach themselves for what they think. This exemplifies 
how regenerate persons are able to see what their rational prior to regeneration is like. In man's case however such perception is received from the Lord, but in the Lord's case it was Self-derived. </p>

`Illudentem': quod significet non congruum et favens Divino Rationali, constare potest a significatione `illudere' quod affectionis contra id quod non sibi congruit et favet. In versu praecedente dictum 
quod `crevit natus, et ablactatus' et quod `Abraham fecerit convivium magnum cum ablactavit Jishakum,' per quae significatum quod cum Rationale Domini Divinum fieret, rationale quod prius, separaretur: 
ideo nunc immediate sequitur de filio Hagaris Aegyptiae, per quem quod illud rationale intelligatur, in explicatione ad cap. xvi Gen. ubi de Ismaele et Hagare agitur, ostensum est; inde quoque 
patet quod illa quae in sensu interno, continua serie consequantur.  [2] Quod autem rationale primum Domini attinet, hoc quia natum sicut apud alium hominem, nempe per scientias et cognitiones, non potuit 
quin in veri apparentiis esset, quae non vera sunt in ut constare potest ab illis quae n. 1911, 1936, 2196, 2203, 2209, 2519 allata sunt; et quia in veri apparentiis, non potuerunt ei congruere nec 
favere vera absque apparentiis, qualia sunt Divina, tam quia illa non capit, quam quia ei adversantur:  [3] sed illustrationi sint exempla.  Rationale humanum, quod scilicet natum {1} a mundanis per 
sensualia et dein ab analogis mundanorum per scientifica et cognitiones, paene irridet hoc seu illudit, si ei diceretur quod non viveret ex se, sed quod ei appareat sicut viveret ex se; et quod plus 
vivat, hoc est, sapientius et intelligentius, beatius et felicius, qui minus credit quod {2} vivat (c)ex se, et quod haec vita sit angelorum, imprimis illorum qui caelestes sunt, ac intimi seu proximi 
Domino; sciunt enim quod nullus vivat a se, quam solus Jehovah, hoc est, Dominus.  [4] Rationale illud illuderet  quoque, si ei diceretur quod nullum ei proprium sit, sed quod fallacia aut apparentia 
sit quod habeat; et adhuc magis, si (o)ei diceretur quod quo plus in fallacia sit quod proprium ei, eo minus habeat, ac vicissim; pariter quicquid ex proprio cogitat et agit, quod sit malum tametsi 
{3} esset bonum; et quod non prius sapiat quam cum credit et percipit quod omne malum ab inferno, et omne bonum a Domino; in illa fide, immo perceptione, sunt omnes angeli, qui tamen proprium abundantius 
quam omnes habent, sed sciunt et percipiunt quod illud a Domino, at quod prorsus appareat sicut eorum.  [5] Adhuc rationale illud illuderet, si diceretur quod in caelo maximi sint qui minimi; quod 
sapientissimi, qui se minime sapientes esse credunt et percipiunt; quod felicissimi, qui alios maxime felices, se autem minime, esse volunt; quod caelum sit infra omnes velle esse, at infernum supra 
omnes; consequenter quod in gloria caeli sit prorsus nihil quod est in gloria mundi.  [6] (m)Similiter illuderet rationale illud, si diceretur quod in altera vita nihil spatii et temporis sit, sed quod 
sint status secundum quos sunt apparentiae; et quod vita eo caelestior sit, quo longius ab illis quae sunt spatii et temporis abest, et (o)quo propius est ad illa quae sunt aeternum, in quo, nempe aeterno, 
nihil prorsus (c)ab idea temporis, nec ab analogo ejus, inest(n): ita in innumerabilibus aliis.  [7] Quod talia in rationali mere humano essent, et quod ideo hoc rationale Divina illuderet, vidit 
Dominus, et quidem ex Divino spirituali, quod significatur per quod `vidit Sarah filium Hagaris Aegyptiae,' n. 2651, 2652: quod homo ex interiore possit intueri in illa apud se quae infra sunt, ab 
experientia notum est illis qui in perceptione sunt, etiam illis qui in conscientia, nam vident eousque, ut ipsas suas cogitationes redarguant; inde possunt regenerati videre quoque eorum rationale quod 
iis ante regenerationem, sit; sed talis perceptio apud hominem est a Domino; verum Domini fuit ex Se Ipso. 	@1 natura I.$ 	@2 A had quo minus credit et sic quo minus ei apparet quod but alters first 
quo to qui.$ 	@3 A had tametsi esset bonum quod faceret but d quod faceret. The meaning is evidently that `what was done' may be good but that `the man's action' is bad.$ </p>
