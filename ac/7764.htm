THE INTERNAL SENSE.      Verses 1-3. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Yet one plague more will I bring upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterward he will let you go from hence; when he lets everything go, 
driving he shall drive you out from hence. Say now in the ears of the people, and let them ask a man from his companion, and a woman from her companion, vessels of silver and vessels of gold. And Jehovah 
gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians. Moreover, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of Pharaoh's servants, and in the eyes of the people. "And Jehovah said 
unto Moses," signifies instruction; "Yet one plague more will I bring upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt," signifies the end of vastation, which is damnation; "afterward he will let you go from hence," signifies 
that then they will be left; "when he lets everything go, driving he shall drive you out from hence," signifies that they will leave them completely, and will hold them in aversion, and shun their 
presence; "say now in the ears of the people," signifies instruction and obedience; "and let them ask a man from his companion, and a woman from her companion, vessels of silver and vessels of gold," 
signifies that the memory-knowledges of truth and good taken away from the evil who have been of the church, will be bestowed upon the good who are of it; "and Jehovah gave the people favor in the 
eyes of the Egyptians," signifies the fear of those who are in evils on account of those who are of the spiritual church, by reason of the plagues; "moreover, the man Moses was very great in the land 
of Egypt," signifies respect now for truth Divine; "in the eyes of Pharaoh's servants, and in the eyes of the people," signifies with those who were in subordination there. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE </p>
<p>Verses 1-3 And Jehovah said to Moses, One more plague I will bring onto Pharaoh and onto Egypt; afterwards he will send you away from here. When he sends everything away he will 
surely drive you out from here. Say now in the ears of the people, and let them ask, a man from his companion and a woman from her companion, vessels of silver and vessels of gold. And Jehovah gave the 
people favour<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> in the eyes of the Egyptians. Also the man Moses was exceedingly great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of Pharaoh's servants and in the eyes of the people. </p>
<p>'And Jehovah said to 
Moses' means instruction. 'One more plague I will bring onto Pharaoh and onto Egypt' means the final stage of vastation, which is damnation. 'Afterwards he will send you away from here' means that then 
they will be left alone. 'When he sends everything away he will surely drive you out from here' means that they will leave them completely, and will loathe and shun their presence. 'Say now in the ears 
of the people' means instructions and obedience. 'And let them ask, a man from his companion and a woman from her companion, vessels of silver and vessels of gold' means that factual knowledge of 
truth and of good must be removed from the evil who have belonged to the Church and be assigned to the good who belong to it. 'And Jehovah gave the people favour in the eyes of the Egyptians' means fear, 
on account of the plagues, which those immersed in evils had of those who belonged to the spiritual Church. 'Also the man Moses was exceedingly great in the land of Egypt' means respect for God's 
truth now. 'In the eyes of the servants and in the eyes of the people' means with those who were in subordinate positions there.

SENSUS INTERNUS </p>
<p>Vers. 1-3.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Adhuc plagam unam adducam super Pharaonem, et super Aegyptum; post ita dimittet vos abhinc; sicut dimittere illum omne, expellendo expellet 
vos abhinc.  Dic age in auribus populi, et petant vir ex socio suo, et mulier ex socia sua, vasa argenti et vasa auri.  Et dedit Jehovah gratiam populi in oculis Aegyptiorum; etiam vir Moscheh magnus 
valde in terra Aegypti, in oculis servorum Pharaonis, et in oculis populi.  `Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen' significat instructionem: `Adhuc plagam unam adducam super Pharaonem, et super Aegyptum' significat 
finem vastationis, qui damnatio: `post ita dimittet vos abhinc' significat quod tunc relinquentur: `sicut dimittere illum omne, expellendo expellet vos abhinc' significat quod relinquent plane, 
ac aversabuntur et fugient praesentiam illorum: `dic age in auribus populi' significat informationem et oboedientiam: `et petant vir ex socio suo, et mulier ex socia sua, vasa argenti et vasa auri' 
significat quod scientifica veri et boni, adempta malis qui fuerunt ab Ecclesia, addicanda erunt bonis qui inde: `et dedit Jehovah gratiam populi in oculis Aegyptiorum' significat timorem illorum qui 
in malis pro illis qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, propter plagas: `etiam vir Moscheh magnus valde in terra Aegypti' significat respectum pro vero Divino nunc: `in oculis servorum, et in oculis populi' significat 
apud illos qui ibi in subordinatione erant. </p>
