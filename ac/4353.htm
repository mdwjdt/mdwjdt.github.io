<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4353节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4353.</strong>“亲他”表出于爱的内在结合。这从“亲”的含义清楚可知，“亲”是指出于爱的内在结合（参看<a href="3573.htm">3573</a>，<a href="3574.htm">3574</a>，<a href="4215.htm">4215</a>节），在此是指内在结合。本节总体上论述了“以扫”所表神性属世良善与“雅各”所表属世真理的结合；不过，接下来的几节详细论述了这种结合。关于这种结合本身，正是该结合实现人的重生；因为人通过以下事实重生：他里面的真理与良善结合，也就是属于信仰的事物与属于仁爱的事物结合。本节和接下来的几节充分描述了这个过程。诚然，所论述的主题是主，即祂如何使其属世层变成神性，因而如何将神性良善联结到属世层里面的真理上。不过，由于人的重生是主荣耀的形像（<a href="3138.htm">3138</a>，<a href="3212.htm">3212</a>，<a href="3296.htm">3296</a>，<a href="3490.htm">3490</a>节），所以这种重生同时也是内义上所论述的主题。还由于相比获得主荣耀的概念，人更容易获得重生的概念。主的荣耀可通过人的重生来说明。<br />从所给出的解释明显可知，藉以实现重生的良善与真理的结合，是一个越来越向内发展的过程，也就是说，真理逐渐越来越内在地与良善结合。因为重生的目的是：内在人能与外在人结合，因而属灵人能通过理性人与属世人结合。没有这二者的结合，就没有重生。这种结合是不可能实现的，除非良善首先被联结到属世层里面的真理上；因为属世层必须作为基础层面存在，属世层里面的事物必须与它们之上的事物相对应。这就是为何当属世层正在重生时，良善与真理的结合逐渐变得越来越内在的原因。因为属灵层首先与属世层里面的至内在之物结合，然后通过这些与那些更外在的事物结合。人的内在也无法与其外在结合，除非外在里面的真理变成真理的良善，也就是变成意愿和行为中的真理（<a href="4337.htm">4337</a>节）。只有那时它们才能首次结合，因为主通过祂的内在人，事实上通过那里的良善流入人里面。这种良善能与外在人里面的良善结合，但不能直接与真理结合。<br />由此可见，在理性人与属世人，或内在人与外在人能够结合之前，人里面的真理必须首先变成意愿与行为中的真理，也就是真理的良善。至于真理如何变成真理的良善，凡注意这一点的人必能清楚看出来。一切神性真理皆关注这两条诫命：爱神高于一切，爱邻如己。真理就源于这两条诫命并为之而存在，并且这两条诫命也是真理所通向的目的，无论是远还是近。因此，当真理被付诸行动时，它们就逐渐被引入其初始和目的，也就是说，被引入对邻之仁和对主之爱，真理由此变成良善，也就是所谓的真理之良善。当这一切发生时，真理就能与内在人结合，这种结合随着越来越内在的真理被植入在这良善里面而逐渐变得越来越内在。行为首先到来，人对它的意愿随之而来。因为人出于理解力所行的，他最后会出于意愿来行，直到最终作为一种习惯而具有它。当这一点达到时，它就被引入理性人或内在人；一旦它被引入，此人就不再出于真理，而是出于良善行善。因为他现在开始感受到它里面的某种祝福，可以说是某种天上的事物。这一切在他死后仍留在他身上，主通过它将其举升天堂。</p>

And kissed him. That this signifies interior conjunction from love, is evident from the signification of "kissing," as being conjunction from love (see n. 3573, 3574, 4215), here interior conjunction. 
In this verse the conjunction of the Divine good of the natural which is "Esau," with the truth there which is "Jacob," is treated of in general; but in what follows this conjunction is described specifically. 
As regards the conjunction itself, it is this which effects man's regeneration; for man is regenerated by the fact that the truths in him are being conjoined with good, that is, that the things 
which belong to faith are being conjoined with those which belong to charity. The process is fully described in these and the following verses. The Lord is indeed the subject treated of how He made 
His natural Divine, consequently how He united Divine good to the truth in His natural. But as man's regeneration is an image of the Lord's glorification (n. 3138, 3212, 3296, 3490), this regeneration 
is also treated of at the same time in the internal sense. And as regeneration can fall into man's idea, but not so fully the Lord's glorification, the latter may be illustrated by the former. [2] 
It is manifest from what has been explained that the conjunction of good with truths (by which regeneration is effected) progresses more and more interiorly; that is, truths are successively conjoined 
more interiorly with good. For the end of regeneration is that the internal man may be conjoined with the external, thus the spiritual with the natural through the rational. Without the conjunction 
of both of these there is no regeneration. Nor can this conjunction be effected until good has first been conjoined with truths in the natural; for the natural must be the plane, and the things that 
are in the natural must correspond. This is the reason why when the natural is being regenerated, the conjunction of good with truths becomes successively more interior. For the spiritual conjoins itself 
first with the things which are inmost in the natural, and then by means of these with those which are more exterior. Nor can man's internal conjoin itself with his external, unless the truth in 
the external becomes the good of truth, that is, truth in will and act (n. 4337); for then for the first time they can be conjoined, inasmuch as the Lord flows in with man through his internal man, and 
in fact through the good therein. This good can be conjoined with good in the external man, but not good with truth immediately.  [3] From this it may be seen that the truth in man must first become 
truth in will and act (that is, the good of truth), before the conjunction of the rational with the natural, or the internal man with the external, can take place. But how truth becomes the good of 
truth, must be evident to everyone who pays attention. All Divine truth regards these two precepts-to love God above all things, and the neighbor as one's self. It is these precepts from which and for 
the sake of which truths are, and to which truths tend, more nearly and more remotely. Therefore when truths are put into act, they are instilled successively into their beginning and their end, namely, 
into charity toward the neighbor, and into love to the Lord; and thereby truth becomes good, which is called the good of truth; and when this takes place, it can then be conjoined with the internal 
man, which conjunction becomes successively more interior, in proportion as more interior truths are implanted in this good. Act precedes, man's willing follows; for that which a man does from the understanding, 
he at last does from the will, and finally puts it on as a habit; and it is then instilled in his rational or internal man. And when it has been instilled in this, the man no longer does 
good from truth, but from good; for he then begins to perceive therein somewhat of blessedness, and as it were somewhat of heaven. This remains with him after death, and by means of it he is uplifted 
into heaven by the Lord. </p>

'And kissed him' means an interior joining together brought about by love. This is clear from the meaning of 'kissing' as a joining together brought about by love, dealt with in <a href="3573.htm">3573</a>, <a href="3574.htm">3574</a>, <a href="4215.htm">4215</a>, in 
this case an interior joining together. The present verse deals with the joining of Divine Natural Good, meant by 'Esau', to Natural Truth, meant by 'Jacob'. It deals with this in general, whereas the 
verses which follow deal more specifically with that joining together. As regards the actual joining together, it is that which brings about a person's regeneration, for he is regenerated through the 
joining of the truths he knows to the good he cherishes, that is, through the joining of matters of faith to the deeds of charity The process of that joining together is described fully in this verse 
and in those that follow. The subject, it is true, is the Lord - how He made His Natural Divine and therefore how He united Divine Good to Truth within the Natural; but because the regeneration of man 
is an image of the glorification of the Lord, <a href="3138.htm">3138</a>, <a href="3212.htm">3212</a>, <a href="3296.htm">3296</a>, <a href="3490.htm">3490</a>, that regeneration too is at the same time the subject in the internal sense. And because man can get an idea of regeneration more 
easily than he can of the Lord's glorification, let His glorification be illustrated by means of man's regeneration. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It is evident from the explanations which have been given that the joining 
together of good and truths which leads to regeneration is a process that grows more and more interior; that is, truths are joined step by step more interiorly to good. For the object of regeneration 
is that the internal man may be joined to the external, and so the spiritual man be joined to the natural through the rational Unless the two are joined together no regeneration is accomplished. Nor 
can that joining together be effected until good has first been joined to the truths within the natural; for the natural has to exist as the underlying groundwork, and things within the natural have to 
exist in correspondence with those above them. This is the reason why, when the natural is being regenerated, the joining together of good and truths becomes step by step more interior; for the spiritual 
first joins itself to the things that are inmost in the natural, and after that through these to those that are more exterior. Nor can man's internal join itself to his external unless the truth 
within that external becomes the good of truth, that is, becomes truth in will and action, <a href="4337.htm">4337</a>. Only then can they be joined together, for the Lord flows into a person through his internal man, especially 
through the good there. The good there is able to be joined to the good in the external man, but not directly to the truth </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From this it becomes clear that the truth residing with man must 
first of all become truth in will and action, that is, become the good of truth, before the joining together of the rational and the natural, or of the internal man and the external, can come about. 
But in what way truth becomes the good of truth may be clear to anyone who gives his attention to it. Every Divine truth is related to the following two commandments: Love God above all things, and love 
your neighbour as yourself. These two commandments are the base from which truths are derived, the reason why truths exist, and the end to which truths lead - immediately or remotely. Therefore when 
truths are translated into action they are introduced step by step into their beginning and into their end, that is to say, into charity towards the neighbour and love to the Lord, and as a consequence 
truth becomes the good which is called the good of truth. Once truth becomes such it is able to be joined to the internal man, a conjunction which becomes step by step more interior as truths that 
are more interior are implanted within that good. Action comes first, then the desire for it in the person's will follows. For when a person is led by his understanding to carry out any action, he is 
at length led by his will to do it, till at last he has taken it on as an action performed habitually. When this point is reached it is introduced into the rational or internal man; and once it has 
been introduced, truth is no longer that which motivates him when he does a good action but good. For now he begins to feel within it something of what is blessed and so to speak of heaven. This remains 
with him after death, and by means of it the Lord raises him up to heaven. </p>

`Et osculatus eum':  quod significet conjunctionem interiorem ex amore, constat ex significatione `osculari' quod sit conjunctio ex amore, de qua n. 3573, 3574, 4215, hic conjunctio interior.  Agitur 
in hoc versu in genere de conjunctione Boni Divini naturalis, quod `Esau,' cum vero ibi quod `Jacob'; in sequentibus `autem' de conjunctione illa in specie agitur.  Quod ipsam conjunctionem attinet, 
est illa quae facit regenerationem apud hominem, nam homo regeneratur per id quod vera apud illum conjungantur bono, hoc est, quod illa quae sunt fidei, conjungantur illis quae sunt charitatis; 
processus hic et in sequentibus plene {1} describitur; agitur quidem de Domino quomodo Ipse Naturale Suum Divinum fecerat, proinde quomodo Ipse Divinum Bonum univerat Vero in Naturali; sed quia 
regeneratio hominis est imago glorificationis Dominis n. 3138, 3212, 3296, 3490, etiam de illa in sensu interno simili agitur; et quia regeneratio in ideam hominis cadere potest, non autem ita glorificatio 
Domini, licet hanc illustrare per illam.  [2] Ex illis quae explicata sunt, patet quod conjunctio boni cum veris per quam regeneratio, interius et interius progrediatur hoc est, vera interius 
successive conjungantur cum bono; finis enim regenerationis est ut conjungatur internus homo cum externo, ita spiritualis per rationale cum naturali; absque conjunctione utriusque nulla est regeneratio; 
nec potest illa conjunctio fieri antequam bonum cum veris in naturali (o)prius conjunctum est; </p>
<p>naturale enim erit planum et quae in naturali sunt, correspondebunt; haec causa est quod cum 
naturale regeneratur, conjunctio boni cum veris interior successive fiat; nam spirituale se conjungit primum cum illis quae intima sunt in naturali, et dein per haec cum illis quae exteriora sunt: 
nec potest internum hominis se conjungere cum externo ejus nisi verum in hoc fiat veri bonum, hoc est, voluntate et actu verum, n. 4337, tunc enim primum conjungi possunt, nam Dominus {2} influit 
apud hominem per internum hominem et quidem per bonum ibi; bonum ibi cum bono in externo homine conjungi potest, non autem bonum cum vero immediate; [3] inde constare potest quod verum apud hominem 
prius fieri debeat voluntate et actu verum, hoc est, veri bonum, antequam conjunctio rationalis cum naturali, (o)seu interni hominis cum externo, existere potest; quomodo autem verum fit veri bonum, 
constare potest cuivis qui attendit; omne verum Divinum spectat bina haec praecepta, nempe amare Deum supra omnia, et proximum sicut semet; </p>
<p>illa praecepta sunt ex quibus vera, et propter quae vera, 
et ad quae vera, propius et remotius; quapropter cum vera in actum mittuntur, tunc insinuantur {3} successive in principium et finem suum, nempe in charitatem erga proximum et in amorem in Dominum, 
et inde verum fit bonum quod vocatur veri bonum; quod cum fit, tunc conjungi illud potest cum interno homine, quae conjunctio fit interior successive quo interiora vera implantantur illi bono: </p>
<p>actus 
praecedit, velle hominis succedit, nam quod agit homo ex intellectu, hoc tandem agit ex voluntate, et demum per habitum induit illud; et tunc insinuatur rationali seu interno homini; et cum 
illi insinuatum est, tunc non magis ex vero bonum agit sed ex bono; incipit enim tunc percipere aliquid beati, et sicut aliquid caeli in illo; hoc manet illum {4} post mortem, et per id elevatur in 
caelum a Domino.      @1 i in sensu interno$      @2 Dominus enim$      @3 i illa$      @4 A d illum$ </p>
