<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6004节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6004.</strong>“你不要怕下埃及去”表属世真理及其所属一切必须被引入教会所知的记忆知识。这从雅各的代表，以及“下去”和“埃及”的含义清楚可知：雅各，即被吩咐要下埃及去的人，是指属世真理，如刚才所述（<a href="6001.htm">6001</a>节）；“下去”是指被引入，因为能代表这种引入，雅各与属于他的一切都下埃及去；“埃及”是指教会所知的记忆知识（<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>，<a href="4749.htm">4749</a>，<a href="4964.htm">4964</a>，<a href="4966.htm">4966</a>节）。<br />至于被引入教会所知的记忆知识的真理，情况是这样：那时，教会的记忆知识就是其仪式的代表和有意义的符号，因为教会的一切仪式皆源于这些代表和符号，帮助教会成员理解仁之教义的记忆知识也是如此。他从这些记忆知识得知穷人、穷乏的、患难的、困苦的、受压迫的、寡妇、孤儿、寄居的、坐监的、赤身露体的、患病的、饥饿的、口渴的、瘸腿的、瞎眼的、聋子、残废的，以及他们将邻舍所分成的许多其它种类都是指谁。他们通过这种区分教导当如何实行仁爱。这就是那时其记忆知识的样子。但如今，这些记忆知识完全被抹去了，这一点从以下事实明显看出来：当圣言提及上述人时，几乎没有人知道别的，只知道他们是字面上所指的人，如当提及“寡妇”时，就是指字面上的寡妇，当提及“寄居的”时，就是指字面上的“寄居的”，当提及“坐监的”时，就是指字面上的“坐监的”，等等。此处所提及的这类记忆知识在埃及蓬勃发展；这就是为何“埃及”表示记忆知识。属世真理，即“雅各”需要被引入这类记忆知识，这一点由雅各和他一切所有的都下埃及去来代表。<br />当真理被聚集到这类记忆知识中，以至于存在于它们里面时，就说真理被引入记忆知识。成就这一切是为了当一个记忆知识进入思维时，被聚集到它里面的真理同时被忆起。例如，当想起一个“寄居的”时，鉴于“寄居的”表示那些将要接受教导的人，故向这类人实行仁爱的各种方法就会立刻涌入脑海，也就是说，真理会涌入脑海。当想到其他人时，情况也一样。当记忆知识充满这些真理时，凡基于这些知识的思维就会扩散并传播得越来越广，同时抵达天堂的众多社群。事实上，这样的记忆知识因由包含在它自己里面的如此众多的真理构成，故在人不知不觉的情况下以这种方式展开。不过，它们必须是在它们里面的真理。<br />内层事物要聚集到外层事物中，或也可说，在先之物要聚集到在后之物中，因而最终一切在先之物都要聚集到最后和最低之物中，并与之共存，这也是神性秩序的一个基本特征。整个自然界都是这种情况。若非如此，没有人能完全重生；因为通过真理在记忆知识里面的这样一种聚集，内层事物与外层事物一致存在，并行如一体；否则，它们就不一致。如果它们不一致，此人就无法处于良善，因为他缺乏诚意。此外，记忆知识所居之光与人的肉体视觉所居的低劣之光几乎完全相同。这种低劣之光具有这种性质：它若不从里面被真理之光光照，就会导致虚假，尤其导致从感官幻觉或谬误所产生的虚假，还导致虚假所产生的邪恶。这一事实从关于各章末尾所讲述的流注的经历可以看出来。</p>

Fear not to go down into Egypt. That this signifies that natural truth with all things appertaining to it must be initiated into the memory-knowledges of the church, is evident from the representation 
of Jacob, who is he that was to go down into Egypt, as being natural truth (of which just above, n. 6001); and from the signification of "going down," as being to be initiated, for in order that this 
initiation might be represented, Jacob with all that appertained to him went down into Egypt; and from the signification of "Egypt," as being the memory-knowledges of the church (n. 1462, 4749, 4964, 
4966). [2] In regard to truth being initiated into the memory-knowledges of the church, the case is this. The memory-knowledges of the church were at that time the representatives and significatives 
of their rituals, for all the rituals of the church were from such things, as also were the memory-knowledges which served as their doctrinals of charity. From these memory-knowledges they knew who 
are meant by the poor, the needy, the miserable, the afflicted, the oppressed, widows, orphans, sojourners, the bound in prison, the naked, the sick, the hungry, the thirsty, the lame, the blind, the 
deaf, the maimed, and by many other classes into which they distinguished the neighbor, and thus taught how charity was to be exercised. Such were the memory-knowledges of that time. That at this day 
these are altogether blotted out of remembrance is evident from the fact that where the above are mentioned in the Word, scarcely anyone knows but that such are meant as are so called-as that widows are 
meant where "widows" are mentioned, sojourners where "sojourners" are mentioned, the bound in prison where these are mentioned, and so on. Such memory-knowledges flourished in Egypt; and therefore 
by "Egypt" are signified memory-knowledges. That natural truth which is "Jacob" was to be initiated into such memory-knowledges, is represented by Jacob's going down into Egypt with all that belonged 
to him. [3] Truths are said to be initiated into such memory-knowledges when they are brought into them, so as to be in them. This is effected for the reason that when a memory-knowledge comes into the 
thought, the truths which have been brought into it may come at the same time into remembrance; as for example, when a sojourner is presented to the thought, seeing that by him are signified those 
who are to be instructed, that there should instantly come into thought all the exercises of charity toward such, thus truths. In like manner in all other cases. When memory-knowledges are thus filled, 
then when anyone is thinking from them, the thought extends and diffuses itself far and wide, and indeed to many societies in the heavens at the same time. For such a memory-knowledge, consisting as 
it does of so many truths within itself, unknown to the man, unfolds itself in this way; but it is necessary that truths be in them. [4] It is also of Divine order for interior things to bestow themselves 
in exterior ones, or what is the same, prior things in posterior ones, thus at last all prior things in the ultimates, and for them to be together there. This is the case in universal nature. Unless 
this is done the man cannot be fully regenerated, for by such a bringing of truths into memory-knowledges, things interior and exterior agree together and make a one which otherwise would be in 
disagreement; and if they are in disagreement, the man is not in good, because he is not in what is sincere. Moreover memory-knowledges are in a light nearly the same as that in which is the sensual of 
man's sight, and this light is such that unless it is enlightened within by the light which is from truths, it leads into falsities, especially into those derived from the fallacies of the senses; and 
also into evils from falsities. That this is the case will be seen from the experience about influx that is related at the close of the chapters. </p>

'Do not be afraid of going down to Egypt' means that natural truth and all that accompanies it must be introduced into the facts known to the Church. This is clear from the representation of Jacob, the 
one who is told that he should 'go down to Egypt', as natural truth, dealt with just above in <a href="6001.htm">6001</a>; from the meaning of 'going down' as being introduced into, for in order that the introduction might 
be represented Jacob went down into Egypt together with all who were his; and from the meaning of 'Egypt' as the facts known to the Church, dealt with in <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>, <a href="4749.htm">4749</a>, <a href="4964.htm">4964</a>, <a href="4966.htm">4966</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 What an introduction 
of truth into the facts known to the Church implies is this: The Church's factual knowledge at that time consisted of representatives and meaningful signs contained in ritual observances, for 
all the ritual observances of the Church sprang from those representatives and signs, as also did the factual knowledge which helped members of the Church to understand teachings about charity. From 
that factual knowledge they knew who were really meant by the poor, the needy, the wretched, the afflicted, the oppressed, widows, orphans, strangers, those bound in prison, the naked, the sick, the hungry, 
the thirsty, the lame, the blind, the deaf, the maimed, and many others whom they identified as distinct kinds of the neighbour. By making such distinctions they taught how charity should be exercised. 
This was what their factual knowledge at that time was like. But at the present day that knowledge has been completely wiped out, as is evident from the consideration that where these deprived 
persons are mentioned in the Word scarcely anyone knows more than that those who are literally so deprived are meant, for example that those who are literally widows are meant when 'widows' are mentioned, 
those literally strangers when 'strangers' are mentioned, those literally in prison when they are mentioned, and so on. The kind of knowledge spoken of here flourished in Egypt, which is why 'Egypt' 
means factual knowledge. The need for natural truth, which is 'Jacob', to be introduced into such knowledge is represented by Jacob's going down into Egypt with all that was his.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Truths 
are said to be introduced into factual knowledge when they are gathered together into it so as to exist within it. This is done to the end that when some fact comes to mind the truths that have been gathered 
into it may be recollected at the same time. When for example someone thinks of a stranger, then because 'a stranger' means people who are to receive instruction, all the ways of exercising charity 
towards such people instantly spring to mind, which is to say that truths spring to mind. The same thing happens when he thinks of any of the other kinds of deprived persons. Once known facts have 
been filled with those truths any thought based on those facts expands and spreads far and wide, reaching indeed into many communities in heaven simultaneously. For since such factual knowledge consists 
of so many truths contained within itself, it opens out in that way without the person's being aware of it. But they must be truths that are held within it. It is also an essential feature of Divine 
order that interior things should gather themselves into exterior ones, or what amounts to the same, prior things into posterior ones, so that finally everything prior should be gathered into what 
is last and lowest and coexist with it. This is what happens in the entire natural creation. If this were not true, no one could be fully regenerated; for such a gathering of truths within known facts 
enables interior things and exterior ones, which would otherwise be at variance, to exist in agreement and act as one. If they are at variance the person cannot be governed by good because he lacks 
sincerity. Besides, factual knowledge dwells in virtually the same inferior light as a person's physical sight. This inferior light is such that, unless it is brightened from within by the light received 
from truths, it leads to falsities, especially those that are a product of the illusions of the senses, and to evils that are a product of falsities. The truth of this will be seen from my experience 
presented at the ends of chapters under Influx. </p>

`Ne timeas a descendendo Aegyptum':  quod significet quod verum naturale cum omnibus ejus initiabitur in scientifica  Ecclesiae, constat ex repraesentatione `Jacobi' qui est qui `descenderet Aegyptum', 
quod sit verum naturale, de qua mox supra n. 6001; a significatione `descendere' quod sit initiari, nam ut haec initiatio repraesentaretur, Jacob cum omnibus ejus descendit in Aegyptum; et a significatione 
`Aegypti' quod sint scientifica Ecclesiae, de qua n. 1462, 4749, 4964, 4966.  [2]Cum hoc quod verum initiabitur in scientifica Ecclesiae, ita se habet:  scientifica Ecclesiae fuerunt eo tempore 
repraesentativa et significativa ritualium, nam omnia ritualia Ecclesiae erant ex talibus, tum quoque erant scientifica quae inserviebant doctrinalibus charitatis quae apud illos, {1}ex his scientificis 
sciebant quinam  intelliguntur per pauperes, (x)egenos, miseros, afflictos, oppressos, viduas, pupillos, peregrinos, vinctos in carcere, nudos, aegrotos, esurientes, sitientes, claudos, caecos, 
surdos, mutilos, et per plures alios in quos distinxerunt proximum, et sic docuerunt quomodo charitas exercenda; talia fuerunt scientifica illius temporis; quae quod hodie prorsus obliterata sint, patet 
ex eo quod ubi nominantur in Verbo, vix aliquis sciat quam quod {2}intelligantur tales qui ita vocantur, ut ubi nominantur `viduae', quod sint viduae, ubi `peregrini' quod sint peregrini, ubi `vincti 
in carcere' quod sint illi,  et sic porro; talia scientifica floruerunt in Aegypto, quapropter per `Aegyptum' significantur scientifica; quod in talia scientifica {3}initiaretur  verum naturale quod 
est `Jacob', repraesentatur per quod `Jacob cum omni suo descenderet in Aegyptum'.  [3]Vera in scientifica initiari dicuntur cum in illa conferuntur, ut ibi sint; {4}quod fit ob illam causam ut cum 
in cogitationem venit scientificum, simul in recordationem veniant vera quae illata sunt; ut pro exemplo, cum peregrinus, quia per illum significantur qui instruendi {5}, quod obveniant ilico omnia charitatis 
exercitia erga tales {6}; ita vera; similiter in reliquis; cum scientifica illis impleta sunt, tunc cum cogitatur ex scientificis, extendit et effundit se cogitatio late et quidem ad plures 
societates simul in caelis; nam tale scientificum, quia consistit ex tam multis veris intus in se, explicat se ita homine nesciente; sed vera erunt quae in illis; [4]ex ordine Divino etiam est ut interiora 
se conferre debeant in exteriora seu quod idem, priora in posteriora, ita omnia priora tandem in ultima, et ibi simul erunt; ita fit in universa natura; nisi ita fiat, homo non plene regenerari 
potest, nam per talem illationem verorum in scientifica concordant ac unum faciunt interiora et exteriora quae alioquin discreparent, et si discreparent, homo non est in bono quia non in sincero:  {7} 
praeterea scientifica sunt in lumine paene in quo sensuale visus hominis, et hoc lumen tale est ut nisi illustratum {8}fit intus a luce quae est a veris, {9}inducat in falsa, imprimis ex fallaciis sensuum, 
et quoque in mala ex falsis; quod ita sit, videbitur ab experientia ad finem capitum de {10}Influxu. @1 inde$ @2 per viduas intelliguntur viduae, per peregrinos peregrini, per claudos et caecos
