<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5246节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5246.</strong>“他们便急忙带他出坑”表迅速抛弃诸如属于试探的状态、系一种阻碍的那类事物，以及随之所发生的变化。这从“坑”和“急忙带他出坑”的含义清楚可知：“坑”是指消磨和试探的状态（参看<a href="4728.htm">4728</a>，<a href="4744.htm">4744</a>，<a href="5038.htm">5038</a>节）；“急忙带他出坑”是指迅速抛弃诸如属于它，也就是属于试探状态的那类事物。因为当“坑”表示试探的状态时，“急忙带某人出坑”就表示除去诸如属于这种状态的那类事物，因而是指抛弃它们，这从下文明显看出来，即：他抛弃了坑里的一切，也就是剃头，刮胡子，换衣裳。<br />试探的状态与随后的状态相比，就像坑中或监牢中的境况，肮脏、污秽。因为当人经历试探时，污灵就在他旁边，包围他。他们激起与他同在的邪恶和虚假，还把他摁在里面，夸大它们，直到他感到绝望。正因如此，在这种时候，此人便住在肮脏、污秽当中。此外，当这种状态在来世显为可见时（因为在那里，一切属灵状态的性质都能显为可见），它看似从污秽之地冒出的浓雾；还能闻到从那里发出的恶臭。像这样的气场就包围着经历试探的人，以及经历消磨的人，也就是在低地的坑里之人（参看<a href="4728.htm">4728</a>节）。<br />不过，当试探的状态结束时，云雾就会散去，天空变得晴朗。原因是，通过试探，与人同在的邪恶和虚假便暴露无遗，并被除去；当它们暴露时，那云雾就会显现；而当它们被除去时，晴空便出现。约瑟“剃头，刮胡子，换衣裳”也表示这种状态的变化。<br />此外，试探的状态好比人落入强盗当中时的状态；当他逃出来时，蓬头垢面，衣衫褴褛。他若在试探中屈服，就仍留在这种状态；不过，他若在试探中得胜，那么在脸色镇静下来，梳头换上衣裳后，就会进入幸福、平安的状态。此外，在这些时候，还有地狱的灵人和魔鬼像强盗一样包围并攻击此人，使他受试探。由此明显可知，“他们便急忙带他出坑”表示迅速抛弃诸如属于试探的状态、系一种阻碍的那类事物，以及随之所发生的变化。</p>

And they brought him hastily out of the pit. That this signifies a speedy rejection of such things as from the state of temptation were a hindrance; and thereby a change, is evident from the signification 
of a "pit," as being a state of vastation and also of temptation (see n. 4728, 4744, 5038); and from the signification of "bringing him hastily out of it," as being a speedy rejection of such things 
as are from it, that is, from a state of temptation. For when a "pit" denotes a state of temptation, "to bring anyone hastily out of it" denotes to remove such things as are from that state, and 
consequently to reject them, as is plain also from what follows; for he rejected what was of the pit, inasmuch as he shaved himself and changed his garments. [2] A state of temptation in respect to the 
state after it is also like the condition of a pit or prison-squalid and unclean; for when man is being tempted, unclean spirits are near him, and surround him, and excite the evils and falsities with 
him, and also hold him in them and exaggerate them, even to despair. Hence it is that the man is then in squalor and uncleanness. Moreover when this state is presented to view in the other life (for 
all spiritual states can there be presented to the sight) it appears like a thick mist exhaled from unclean places, and a stench from it is also perceived. Such is the appearance of the sphere that 
encompasses one who is in temptation, and also in vastation, that is, who is in a pit in the lower earth (see n. 4728).  [3] But when the state of temptation ceases, the mist is dispersed, and the sky 
clears. The reason of this is that by means of temptation the falsities and evils with man are laid open and removed; when they are laid open that mist appears, but when they are removed the clear 
sky appears. The change of this state is also signified by Joseph's "shaving himself and changing his garments." [4] Moreover, a state of temptation may be compared to the state of a man when among robbers; 
on escaping from which his hair is disheveled, his countenance wild, and his clothing torn. If he yields in temptation, he remains in a state like this; but if he conquers in temptation, then 
after he has composed his face, combed his hair, and changed his clothing, he comes into a cheerful and serene state. Moreover, there are infernal spirits and genii, who like robbers surround and attack 
the man at these times, and bring on the temptations. From this it is now plain that by their "bringing him hastily out of the pit" is signified a speedy rejection of such things as from the state 
of temptation were a hindrance, and thereby a change. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5246</b></p><p><b>5246.</b>
'And they hurried him out of the pit' means a hasty casting aside of such things as, belonging to a state of temptation, were a hindrance, and a consequent change that was made. This is clear from the 
meaning of 'the pit' as a state in which vastation and also temptation take place, dealt with in <a href="4728.htm">4728</a>, <a href="4744.htm">4744</a>, <a href="5038.htm">5038</a>; and from the meaning of 'hurrying him out of it' as a hasty casting aside of such things 
as belong to this - to a state of temptation. For as 'the pit' describes a state of temptation, 'hurrying someone out of it' describes the removal of such things as belong to that state, consequently 
the casting aside of them, as is evident from what follows next - he cast aside what belonged to the pit, that is, he clipped [his hair and beard] and changed his clothes. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In comparison with 
the state that follows it, a state in which temptation takes place is like conditions in a pit or prison - squalid and unclean. For when a person undergoes temptation unclean spirits are near him 
and round about him. They activate the evils and falsities residing with him; and they also confine him to these, increasing them to the point where he reaches despair. So it is that the person dwells 
at such times amid uncleanness and squalor; and when a visual presentation of that state is made in the next life (for there they can present visually the nature of any spiritual state) it is seen as 
a cloud issuing from filthy places. And one also smells the stench emanating from the same source. A sphere such as this is what surrounds someone undergoing temptation and also someone undergoing vastation, 
that is, one who is in the pit on the lower earth, dealt with in <a href="4728.htm">4728</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But when the state involving temptation comes to an end the cloud is dispersed and the air is made clear. The reason 
this happens is that temptations are the means by which the evils and falsities residing with a person are exposed and removed, the cloud presenting itself while they are being exposed, the clear 
air when they are being removed. The change that takes place in that state is also meant by Joseph clipping [his hair and beard] and changing his clothes. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 One may also compare the state in which 
temptation takes place to a person's condition when he falls among robbers. When he gets away his hair is dishevelled, his face is rough, and his clothes are tom. If he yields in temptation he remains 
in that state; but if he overcomes in temptation his condition is happy and peaceful once he has attended to his face, combed his hair, and changed his clothes. What is more, there are hellish spirits 
and genii who, behaving at such times like robbers, surround and attack him, and so subject him to temptations. From all this it is now evident that 'they hurried him out of the pit' means a hasty 
casting aside of such things as, belonging to a state of temptation, were a hindrance, and a consequent change that was made. </p>

`Et acceleraverunt eum e fovea':  quod significet festinam  rejectionem talium quae impediverunt ex statu tentationis, et inde  mutationem, constat ex significatione `foveae' quod sit status vastationis 
et quoque tentationis, de qua n. 4728, 4744, 5038; et ex significatione `accelerare eum ex (c)illa' quod sit festina rejectio talium quae inde, nempe ex statu tentationis; cum enim `fovea' est status 
tentationis, tunc `accelerare aliquem ex illa' est removere talia quae ex illo statu, consequenter rejicere, ut quoque a nunc sequentibus patet, illa enim quae erant foveae rejecit, totondit enim 
se, et mutavit vestes; [2]status   tentationis {1} respective ad statum post illum, {2}est quoque sicut status foveae seu carceris, squalidus et immundus; cum enim tentatur homo, tunc immundi spiritus 
prope {3}illum sunt, et circumcingunt, et excitant (t)mala et falsa quae apud illum, et quoque detinent illum in illis et exaggerant usque ad desperationem; inde est quod homo tunc in immundo et squalido 
sit {4}; etiam status ille cum sistitur videndus in altera vita, (status omnes spirituales ad visum ibi exhiberi possunt) tunc apparet ille sicut nimbus exhalatus e locis sordidis, et quoque fetor 
inde percipitur; talis apparet sphaera qua circumcingitur   is qui in tentatione est, et quoque qui in vastatione, hoc est, qui in fovea {5} in terra inferiore, de qua n. 4728.  [3]At cum status tentationis 
cessat, tunc dissipatur ille nimbus et fit serenum; causa est quia falsa et mala apud hominem per tentationes aperiuntur et removentur; cum aperiuntur apparet illud nimbosum, et cum removentur, 
apparet serenum; status illius mutatio etiam significatur per quod `Josephus totonderit', et quod `mutaverit vestes'.  [4]Comparari etiam status tentationis potest cum illo statu in quo homo est cum 
inter latrones, a quo cum venit, est horridus quoad comas, asper quoad faciem, et ruptus quoad vestes; si in tentatione succumbit, manet in tali statu, at si in tentatione vincit, tunc postquam reposuit 
faciem, pectinavit   comas et mutavit vestes, in statum hilarem et serenum venit; sunt   quoque spiritus et genii infernales qui instar latronum tunc circumdant   et aggrediuntur, et inducunt tentationes. 
Ex his nunc patet quod   per `acceleraverunt eum e fovea' significetur festina rejectio talium quae impediverunt ex statu tentationis, et inde mutatio. @1 i etiam talis est$ @2 quod sit$ @3 
A d illum$ @4 i sicut qui in fovea$ @5 i quae$ </p>
