<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1100节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1100.</strong>面已说明，“雅弗”表相应的外在教会，还说明何谓外在教会，即外在敬拜，因而那些不知道何为内在人及属内在人之物，但仍过着仁爱生活之人。对这些人而言，主的临在是同等的，因为主在凡有仁爱的地方经由仁爱作工。这与小孩子的情形差不多，尽管这些孩子不知道何为仁爱，更不知道何为信，但主的临在程度远远超过在成人身上的临在程度，尤其在小孩子过着相互仁爱的生活之时。祂以同样的方式与拥有纯真、仁爱和怜悯的简单人同在。若不照着所知道的东西生活，知道很多事对人来说一点用处也没有。因为知道的唯一目的在于人能由此变得善良。一旦变得善良，他拥有的远比知道得非常多，然而却不善良的人要多，因为后者通过大量知识所寻求的东西，后者早已拥有。然而，知道很多真理和良善，同时又拥有仁爱和良知之人的情形则完全不同。因为这种人是内在教会成员，就是“闪”。那些知道得很少，然而拥有良知之人会在来生得到启示，甚至他们会成为天使，拥有无法形容的的聪明智慧。“雅弗”就是指这些人。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1100.</strong> I have already said that Japheth symbolizes the corresponding outer church [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1100/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1062" target=_top>1062</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1100/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1083" target=_top>1083</a>]. What is meant by "the outer church" has also been stated; to be specific, it is outward worship, and consequently it is those who do not know what the inner self is, or what belongs to the inner self, but who still live in charity. The Lord is equally present with these people, because he operates through charity, wherever it exists.<br />The situation resembles that of little children, who have no idea what charity is, still less what faith is, despite which the Lord's presence is much stronger with them than with adults, especially when the children live a life of shared kindness. It is the same with simple-thinking people who have innocence, charity, and mercy.<br />Knowing a lot makes no difference if we do not live by what we know, since the only point in knowing anything is to be shaped by it — specifically, into good people. When we have become good, we gain far more than people who know countless facts without being good, because what they seek to obtain from their vast knowledge, we already possess. It is quite different, though, with a person whose knowledge of truth and goodness is deep and broad, who at the same time has charity and conscience, and who is part of the inner church, or in other words, is Shem.<br />People who know little but possess a conscience become enlightened in the next life — so enlightened that they turn into angels; and then their wisdom and understanding is beyond words. These are the people symbolized by Japheth. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1100</b></p><p><b>1100.</b>
That by "Japheth" is signified a corresponding external church, has been already stated, and also what is meant by an external church, namely, external worship, and thus those who do not know what the 
internal man is, nor anything that belongs to the internal man, and yet live in charity. With these the Lord is equally present, for the Lord works through charity, wherever charity exists. The case 
in this respect is the same as it is with little children, with whom, although they do not know what charity is, still less what faith is, the Lord is nevertheless much more present than with adults, 
especially when the little children live together in charity. And the case is the same with the simple who have innocence, charity, and mercy. It is utterly useless for a man to know many things if he 
does not live according to what he knows. For knowing has no other end than that the man may thereby become good. When he has become good, he has much more than one who knows innumerable things and 
yet is not good; for what the latter seeks by much knowledge, the former already has. Very different, however, is the case with one who knows many truths and goods, and at the same time has charity and 
conscience; for such a one is a man of the internal church, or "Shem." Those who know little and yet have conscience are enlightened in the other life, insomuch that they become angels, and possess 
wisdom and intelligence inexpressible. These are signified by "Japheth." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1100</b></p><p><b>1100.</b>
That 'Japheth' means a corresponding external Church has been discussed already; so also has what is meant by an external Church, namely that it is external worship, and so people who do not know what 
the internal man is and what belongs to the internal man, but who nevertheless lead charitable lives. With them the Lord is just as much present, for the Lord works by means of charity wherever charity 
exists. It is as with young children. Although these do not know what charity is, still less what faith is, the Lord is nevertheless far more present with them than with adults, especially when young 
children lead mutually charitable lives. He is in the same way present with simple people who have innocence, charity, and mercy within them. A person's knowing much counts for nothing if he does 
not live in accordance with what he knows, for the sole purpose of knowledge is that by means of it a person may become good. Once he has become good he possesses far more than someone who knows a vast 
amount and yet is not good, for what the latter seeks to find through many channels, the former possesses already. It is altogether different in the case of one who knows many truths and goods, and 
who at the same time has charity and conscience and is a member of the internal Church, which is 'Shem'. People who know little but have conscience are enlightened in the next life even to the point of 
their becoming angels whose wisdom and intelligence are beyond description. These people are meant by 'Japheth'. </p>

Quod per 'Japhetum' significetur Ecclesia externa correspondens, prius dictum, tum quid per Ecclesiam externam intelligatur, nempe quod cultus externus, ita illi qui nesciunt quid internus homo et quae 
sunt interni hominis, et usque vivunt in charitate; apud hos Dominus aeque praesens est; nam Dominus per charitatem operatur, ubicumque charitas est; se habet hoc sicut cum infantibus, qui tametsi 
nesciunt quid charitas, et minus adhuc quid fides, usque tamen apud eos Dominus multo praesentior est quam apud adultos, cumprimis quando infantes mutuo vivant in charitate; ita apud simplices quibus 
est innocentia, charitas et misericordia; nihil facit quod homo (x)multa sciat si non vivat secundum illa quae scit, nam scire non alium finem habet quam ut inde fiat, nempe bonus; cum factus est bonus, 
multo plus habet quam qui innumera scit et adhuc non bonus est, nam quod hic per multa scire quaerit, ille habet; aliter vero qui multa vera et bona novit, et simul charitatem et conscientiam habet 
et est internae Ecclesiae homo seu 'Shem': qui parum sciunt et conscientiam habent, ii in altera vita illustrantur, usque adeo ut fiant angeli, quorum tunc sapientia et intelligentia est inexpressibilis; 
hi per 'Japhetum' significantur. </p>
