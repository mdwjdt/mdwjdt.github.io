<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3296节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3296.</strong>“大的必服事小的”表真理的良善有一段时间是服从的。这从“大的”、“服事”和“小的”的含义清楚可知：“大的”是指良善；“服事”是指服从；“小的”是指真理。其中的情形从下文可以看出来，因为下文通过以扫和雅各对该情形予以描述。因为如前所述，以扫代表良善，雅各代表真理。针对优先权和统治权所产生的这种相争或争斗在内义上以雅各从以扫那里窃取长子名分，以及他的赐福来描述。然而，这种情况只持续一段时间，这一事实从以撒关于以扫的预言明显看出来：<br />你必倚靠刀剑度日，又必事奉你的兄弟；到你强盛的时候，必从你颈项上挣开他的轭。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创27.40.htm">27:40</a>）<br />很明显，本节所说的这些事具有内义，并且没有内义，没有人能知道它们是什么意思，也就是说，“两族在你肚里，两民从你腹中分立，这民必强于那民，大的必服事小的”是什么意思。它们表示前面所说的那些事，这一事实从下文详细论述该主题的地方明显看出来。此外，人很难相信这段经文包含这类事，除非他了解良善与真理的情况，知道这一个如何从那一个出生，以及人在重生时所经历的状态变化。事实上，就内义而言，主题是主，此处论述的是主如何使祂的属世人变成神性。然而，就代表意义而言，主题是人的重生，因为人的重生就是主之荣耀的形像（<a href="3043.htm">3043</a>，<a href="3138.htm">3138</a>，<a href="3212.htm">3212</a>节），也就是说，人在重生的过程中如同在某个形像中那样看到主如何荣耀祂的人性，或也可说，如何使其变成神性。祂怎样将其人性状态完全变为神性状态，那么在重生人的时候，也就怎样完全改变此人的状态，因为主将他的旧人变为新人。</p>

And the elder shall serve the younger. That this signifies that for a time the good of truth should be inferior, is evident from the signification of the "elder," as being good; from the signification 
of "serving," as being inferior; and from the signification of the "younger," as being truth. How the case herein is may be seen from what follows, where it is described under the representation of 
Esau and Jacob; for as before said by Esau is represented good, and by Jacob, truth. That there was struggling or combat concerning priority and dominion, is described in the internal sense by Jacob's 
taking away from Esau the birthright, and also his blessing; yet that this was done only for a time is manifest from Isaac's prophecy concerning Esau. And upon thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve 
thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck (Gen. 27:40). [2] That these things have an internal sense, and that what 
they signify cannot be known without the internal sense (namely, what is signified by two nations being in the womb, and by two peoples being separated from the bowels, and by one people prevailing 
over the other, and the elder serving the younger), is evident; and that they signify what has been said, is evident from what follows, where much will be said on this subject. Moreover it can with difficulty 
be believed that these expressions involve such things unless it is known how the case is with good and truth, and concerning the birth of the one from the other, and the change of state in 
man when he is being regenerated. In the internal sense indeed the Lord is treated of, and here how He made His natural Divine; nevertheless in the representative sense the regeneration of man is also 
treated of; for man's regeneration is an image of the Lord's glorification (n. 3043, 3138, 3212); that is, in regeneration as in a certain image it appears how the Lord glorified His Human, or what is 
the same, made it Divine. For as the Lord altogether changed His human state into the Divine, so also in man, when He regenerates him, the Lord utterly changes the man's state, for He makes his old man new. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3296</b></p><p><b>3296.</b>
'And the greater will serve the less' means that the good of truth must for a time be subordinate. This is clear from the meaning of 'the greater' as good, from the meaning of 'serving' as being subordinate, 
and from the meaning of 'the less' as truth. This matter may be seen from what follows, being described there by means of Esau and Jacob. For as has been stated, 'Esau' represents good, and 'Jacob' 
truth. The rise of a struggle or conflict over priority and over lordship is described in the internal sense by Jacob's stealing the birthright from Esau and also the blessing. But the fact that 
this situation would last for a time only is evident from Isaac's prophecy concerning Esau, </p>
<blockquote>
And by your sword you will live, and you will serve your brother; and it will be, when you have dominion 
over him, that you will break his yoke from above your neck. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2027:40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 27:40</a>.

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that the things said in this verse have an internal sense, and that without that internal sense nobody can know 
what they mean, is quite evident, that is to say, what is meant by 'two nations are in your womb, and two peoples will be separated from your bowels', and by '[one] people will prevail over [the other] 
people, and the greater will serve the less'. The fact that they do mean the things that have been stated is clear from what follows where the subject is dealt with extensively. Furthermore one can 
scarcely credit that these statements embody such things unless one knows about good and truth, about the birth of the first from the second, and about the change of state with a person when being 
regenerated. In the internal sense the subject is indeed the Lord, here how the Lord made His Natural Divine. But in the representative sense the subject is the regeneration of man, for man's regeneration 
is an image of the Lord's glorification, <a href="3043.htm">3043</a>, <a href="3138.htm">3138</a>, <a href="3212.htm">3212</a> - that is, in regeneration one sees as in a certain image the manner in which the Lord glorified His Human, or what amounts to the same, 
made it Divine. For as the Lord changed completely His human state into a Divine one, so also does the Lord when He is regenerating man change his state completely, for He turns his old man into a new man. </p>

</p><b>3296.</b>
`Et major serviet minori': quod significet quod bonum veri inferius erit ad tempus, constat ex significatione `majoris' quod sit bonum; a significatione `servire' quod sit inferius esse; et a significatione 
`minoris' quod sit verum. Hoc quomodo se habet, constare potest a sequentibus, nam ibi describitur {1}per Esavum et Jacobum, nam, ut dictum{2}, per `Esavum' repraesentatur bonum, per `Jacobum' 
verum;quod collisio seu pugna exstiterit de prioritate et dominatu, in sensu interno describitur per Jacobum quod primogenituram sustulerit Esavo, tum quod quoque benedictionem, sed usque quod hoc factum 
sit modo ad tempus, patet ex prophetico Jishaki de Esavo,           Et super gladio tuo vives, et fratri tuo servies, et erit      cum dominaris, disrumpes jugum illius desuper collo tuo, Gen.  
    xxvii 40. [2] Quod haec internam sensum habeant, et quod absque sensu interno non sciri possit quid significant, patet, nempe quid quod `duae gentes in utero, et duo populi ex visceribus separabuntur,' 
et quod `populus prae populo valebit, et major serviet minori'; quod tamen significent illa quae dicta sunt, constat a sequentibus in quibus de illa re multum agitur; et praeterea aegre potest 
credi quod illa talia involvant, nisi sciatur quomodo se habet cum bono et vero, deque unius nascentia ex altero, et de status mutatione apud hominem cum regeneratur; in sensu interno agitur quidem 
de Domino, et hic quomodo Dominus Naturale Suum Divinum fecit, sed usque in sensu repraesentativo etiam agitur de regeneratione hominis; est enim regeneratio in hominis imago glorificationis Domini, 
n. 3043, 3138, 3212, hoc est, in regeneratione ut in quadam imagine apparet quomodo Dominus Humanum Suum glorificavit, seu quod idem, Divinum fecit; sicut enim Dominus statum Suum humanum prorsus mutavit 
in Divinum, ita etiam Dominus apud hominem, cum regenerat illum, statum ejus prorsus mutat, {3}nam veterem ejus hominem facit novum. @1 i in sequentibus$  @2 i est$  @3 et ex veteri homine facit 
illum novum$  </p>
