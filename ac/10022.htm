<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10022节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10022</strong>.“会幕前”表为洁净，对来自天堂的真理的接受，以及它与良善的结合。这从“会幕”的含义清楚可知，“会幕”是指主所在的天堂（参看<a href="9457.htm">9457</a>，<a href="9481.htm">9481</a>，<a href="9485.htm">9485</a>节）。之所以在此也表示洁净，真理的植入，以及它与良善的结合，是因为小公牛被牵到那个地方被献祭，献祭不仅表示洁净，还表示真理与良善的植入，以及它们的结合。献祭代表洁除邪恶与虚假，以及赎罪（参看<a href="9990.htm">9990</a>，<a href="9991.htm">9991</a>节）；被称为会幕门口的会幕前面的地方，代表真理与良善的结合，该结合被称为天堂的婚姻（<a href="10001.htm">10001</a>节）。正因如此，“你要把小公牛牵到会幕前”表诸如在幼年时期的外在人或属世人致力于洁除邪恶与虚假，因而致力于接受来自天堂的真理，并将它与良善相结合。<br />由于本章接下来的内容涉及祭牲和燔祭，所以必须阐明它们一般代表什么。燔祭和祭牲一般代表邪恶与虚假的洁除；由于所代表的是洁除，所以也代表来自主的良善与真理的植入，以及它们的结合。因为当一个人洁除了邪恶与虚假，这种洁除通过移走它们实现时，来自主的良善与真理就会流入；在这种状态下，良善与真理在何等程度上流入，就在何等程度上被植入并结合。事实上，主不断以良善和真理与每个人同在，但祂只在邪恶和虚假被移走的程度内，因而在此人洁除它们的程度内被接受。真理与良善的结合就是重生。由此可见燔祭和祭牲一般代表什么；至于每一个具体代表什么，这从献上的各种不同的动物或活物清楚看出来。<br />祭牲和燔祭因代表这三者，即邪恶与虚假的洁除，真理与良善的植入，以及它们的结合，故也表示源于信之真理和爱之良善的一切敬拜（<a href="6905.htm">6905</a>，<a href="8680.htm">8680</a>，<a href="8936.htm">8936</a>节）；因为一切敬拜的目的都在于一个人可以洁除邪恶与虚假，因而在于来自主的良善与真理可以植入他，从而使他可以重生，重生通过良善与真理的结合实现。它们的结合构成与人同在的天堂或主的国。</p>

Before the Tent of meeting. That this signifies for purification, the reception of truth from heaven, and its conjunction with good, is evident from the representation of "the Tent of meeting," as being 
heaven where the Lord is (see n. 9457, 9481, 9485). That purification, the implanting of truth, and its conjunction with good are also signified here, is because the bullock was brought thither to 
be sacrificed, and by sacrifices are signified both purification and the implanting of truth and of good, and their conjunction. (That by sacrifices were represented purifications from evils and falsities, 
and also expiations, see n. 9990, 9991; and that by the place before the Tent, which is called the door thereof, is represented the conjunction of truth and good, which is called the heavenly marriage, 
n. 10001.) From this then it is that by "bringing the bullock near before the Tent of meeting" is signified the application of the external or natural man, such as he is in his infancy, to his 
purification from evils and falsities, and thus to the reception of truth from heaven, and its conjunction with good.  [2] As what now follows in this chapter concerns sacrifices and burnt-offerings, 
it must be told what was in general represented by them. By burnt-offerings and sacrifices in general was represented purification from evils and falsities; and because purification was represented, 
there was also represented the implanting of good and truth from the Lord, and likewise their conjunction. For when a man has been purified from evils and falsities, which is effected by their removal, 
then good and truth from the Lord flow in, and insofar as good and truth flow in, in this state, so far they are implanted, and so far they are conjoined; for the Lord is continually present with 
good and truth with every man, but He is not received except insofar as evils and falsities are removed, thus insofar as the man is purified from them. The conjunction of truth and good is regeneration. 
From this it can be seen what was in general represented by burnt-offerings and by sacrifices; but what was specifically represented is evident from the animals of different kinds that were sacrificed. [3] 
As these three things, namely, purification from evils and falsities, the implanting of truth and good, and the conjunction of these, were represented by the sacrifices and burnt-offerings, 
therefore by them is also signified all worship from the truth of faith and the good of love (n. 6905, 8680, 8936); for all worship has as its end that the man may be purified from evils and falsities, 
consequently that goods and truths from the Lord may be implanted in him, and that thus he may be regenerated, which is effected by their conjunction. Their conjunction is heaven or the Lord's kingdom 
with the man. </p>

'Before the tent of meeting' means to purification, the reception of truth from heaven, and the joining of it to good. This is clear from the representation of 'the tent of meeting' as heaven where the 
Lord is, dealt with in <a href="9457.htm">9457</a>, <a href="9481.htm">9481</a>, <a href="9485.htm">9485</a>. The reason why purification, the implantation of truth, and the joining of it to good are also meant here is that the young bull was led to that place to be 
sacrificed, and by sacrifices not only purification but also the implantation of truth and good and joining together of them are meant. For sacrifices represented purifications from evils and falsities, 
and expiations, see <a href="9990.htm">9990</a>, <a href="9991.htm">9991</a>, and the place before the tent, called its door, represented the joining together of truth and good, which is called the heavenly marriage, <a href="10001.htm">10001</a>. So it is then that 
'you shall bring the young bull near before the tent of meeting' means the time when the external or natural man, as this exists in its infancy, applies itself to being purified from evils and falsities, 
and so to receiving truth from heaven and joining it to good.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Since sacrifices and burnt offerings are the subject in what follows directly after this in the present chapter, what was represented 
by them in general must be stated. Burnt offerings and sacrifices in general represented purification from evils and falsities; and since purification was represented, so too was the implantation 
of goodness and truth from the Lord, and also the joining together of them. For when a person has been purified from evils and falsities, which is brought about by the removal of them, goodness and 
truth from the Lord flow in; and to the extent that goodness and truth flow in, in that state, they are implanted and joined together. For the Lord is unceasingly present with goodness and truth with 
every person, but He is received only to the extent that evils and falsities are removed, thus to the extent that the person is purified from them. The joining together of truth and good is regeneration. 
From this it may be seen what burnt offerings and sacrifices in general represented; but what each represented specifically is clear from the different kinds of living creatures that were  sacrificed.

<p><b>[3]</b>
 Because these three - purification from evils and falsities, the implantation of truth and good, and the joining together of them - were represented by sacrifices and burnt offerings, 
all worship springing from the truth of faith and the good of love is also meant by them, <a href="6905.htm">6905</a>, <a href="8680.htm">8680</a>, <a href="8936.htm">8936</a>; for the end in view of all worship is that a person may be purified from evils and falsities, 
consequently that he may have forms of goodness and truth from the Lord implanted in him, and so may be regenerated, which is accomplished by the joining together of that goodness and truth. These 
joined together constitute heaven or the Lord's kingdom with a person.  </p>

`Ante tentorium conventus': quod significet ad purificationem, receptionem veri e caelo, et conjunctionem ejus cum bono, constat ex repraesentatione `tentorii conventus' quod sit caelum ubi Dominus, 
de qua n. 9457, 9481, 9485; quod purificatio, implantatio veri, et conjunctio ejus cum bono, hic quoque significetur, est quia juvencus adducebatur illuc ut sacrificaretur, et per sacrificia significatur 
tam purificatio quam implantatio veri (c)et boni, et conjunctio illorum; quod per sacrificia repraesentatae fuerint purificationes a malis et falsis, ac expiationes, videatur n. 9990, 9991, et quod 
per locum ante tentorium, qui vocatur ostium ejus, repraesentaretur {1} conjunctio veri et boni, quae conjugium caeleste vocatur, n. 10,001; inde nunc est quod per `appropinquare facies juvencum ante 
tentorium conventus' significetur applicatio externi seu naturalis hominis qualis in sua infantia, ad purificationem (o)ejus a malis et falsis, et sic ad receptionem veri e caelo, et conjunctionem 
ejus cum bono. 	[2] Quia de sacrificiis et holocaustis in nunc sequentibus in hoc capite agitur, dicetur quid per illa in genere repraesentatum est: per holocausta et {2} sacrificia in genere repraesentata 
(o)est purificatio a malis et falsis, et quia purificatio repraesentata est {3}, etiam repraesentata est implantatio boni et veri a Domino, et quoque conjunctio eorum; nam quando homo purificatus 
est a malis et falsis, quod fit per remotionem eorum, tunc influit bonum et verum a Domino, et quantum bonum et verum (o)in eo statu influunt, tantum implantantur, et tantum conjungantur; Dominus enim 
jugiter adest cum bono et vero apud unumquemvis hominem, sed non recipitur nisi quantum mala et falsa removentur, ita quantum homo ab illis purificatur; conjunctio veri et boni {4} est regeneratio; 
inde constare potest quid per holocausta et per sacrificia in genere repraesentatum fuit {5}; quid autem in specie, constat ex diversae speciei animalibus quae sacrificabantur. 	[3] Quia illa tria, 
nempe purificatio a malis et falsis, implantatio veri et boni, ac conjunctio eorum, repraesentata sunt per sacrificia et holocausta, ideo per illa etiam significatur omnis cultus ex vero fidei et {6} 
bono amoris, n. 6905, 8680, 8936, nam omnis cultus pro fine habet ut homo a malis et falsis purificetur, consequenter ut ei bona et vera a Domino implantentur, et sic regeneretur, quod fit per conjunctionem 
eorum; conjunctio eorum est caelum seu regnum Domini {7} apud hominem. @1 repraesentatur AIT$ @2 i per$ @3 per illa repraesentata est purificatio$ @4 eorum$ @5 fuerit$ @6 ex$ @7 Dei$ </p>
