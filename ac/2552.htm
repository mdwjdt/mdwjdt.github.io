<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2552.</strong>“亚伯拉罕说”表作为答复的直觉。这从“说”在圣言历史部分中的含义清楚可知，前面已多次解释了“说”的含义（<a href="1791.htm">1791</a>，<a href="1815.htm">1815</a>，<a href="1819.htm">1819</a>，<a href="1822.htm">1822</a>，<a href="1898.htm">1898</a>，<a href="1919.htm">1919</a>，<a href="2061.htm">2061</a>，<a href="2080.htm">2080</a>，<a href="2238.htm">2238</a>，<a href="2260.htm">2260</a>，<a href="2271.htm">2271</a>，<a href="2287.htm">2287</a>节）。至于“亚比米勒又对亚伯拉罕说”表主出于信之教义的思维；“亚伯拉罕说”表作为答复的直觉，情况乃是这样：直觉是更高级的事物，主通过神性本身拥有直觉；而思维则是较为低级的事物，主通过理解力本身拥有思维。由于祂的思维源于直觉，故思维的答复也源于直觉。这一点可通过人身上的类似事实来说明。属天之人若不通过直觉就无法思考，而属灵之人若不通过良知就无法思考（<a href="2515.htm">2515</a>节）。属天之人的直觉类似属灵之人的良知，来源于主，尽管在这个人自己看来，它来自何处并不明显；不过，他的思维源于理性，在他看来似乎来源于他自己。同样的，当人通过理性思考问题时，答复或他思维里的结论要么出自直觉，要么出自良知。所以，他从主那里所接受的答复取决于他自己的生命状态，他的情感，以及所植入或印刻、与这些相一致的教义真理。</p>

Abraham said. That this signifies a perception which is an answer, is evident from the signification of "saying" in the historicals of the Word, as explained many times before (n. 1791, 1815, 1819, 1822, 
1898, 1919, 2061, 2080, 2238, 2260, 2271, 2287). With regard to the Lord's thought from the doctrine of faith being signified by the words "Abimelech said to Abraham;" and the perception which was 
an answer being meant by "Abraham said," the case is this: perception is a higher thing, and the Lord had it from the Divine Itself; whereas thought is a lower thing, and the Lord had it from the intellectual 
itself; and as it was perception from which He had the thought, so the answer of the thought was from perception. This may be illustrated by something similar with man. The celestial man cannot 
think except from perception, nor the spiritual man except from conscience (n. 2515). The perception of the former, like the conscience [of the latter] is from the Lord, and it is not apparent to 
the man himself whence it is; but his thought is from the rational, and appears to him as from himself. And so again, when a man is thinking concerning any subject from the rational, then the conclusion 
of the thought, or the answer, comes either from perception or from conscience; consequently an answer is given him by the Lord in accordance with his state of life, his affection, and the truth of 
doctrine implanted or impressed in agreement therewith. </p>

'Abraham said' means a perception, which constituted a reply. This is clear from the meaning in historical narratives of the Word of 'saying', dealt with many times already, as in <a href="1791.htm">1791</a>, <a href="1815.htm">1815</a>, <a href="1819.htm">1819</a>, <a href="1822.htm">1822</a>, <a href="1898.htm">1898</a>, <a href="1919.htm">1919</a>, <a href="2061.htm">2061</a>, <a href="2080.htm">2080</a>, <a href="2238.htm">2238</a>, <a href="2260.htm">2260</a>, <a href="2271.htm">2271</a>, <a href="2287.htm">2287</a>. As regards the Lord's thought from the doctrine of faith being meant by the expression 'Abimelech said to Abraham' but a perception which constituted 
a reply, by the expression 'Abraham said', the position is that perception is something higher, which in the Lord's case was from the Divine itself, whereas thought is something lower, which in the 
Lord's case was from the understanding itself. And because it was perception from which His thought sprang, so was the reply possessed by His thought derived from perception. This may be illustrated 
by means of something similar with man. The celestial man is unable to think except from perception, and the spiritual is unable to do so except from conscience, <a href="2515.htm">2515</a>. The perception of the celestial 
man, like the conscience [of the spiritual], originates in the Lord, though to the individual himself it is not apparent where it comes from; but his thought springs from the rational and seems to him 
to originate in himself. Thus again when he thinks about any matter from the rational the conclusion within his thought, or the reply, comes either from perception or from conscience. Consequently any 
reply which he receives from the Lord is conditioned by his own state of life, by his affection, and by the truth of doctrine implanted or imprinted in conformity with these. </p>

`Dixit Abraham': quod significet perceptionem quae responsum, constat ex significatione `dicere' in historicis Verbi; {1} de qua multoties prius, ut n. 1791, 1815, 1819, 1822, 1898, 1919, 2061, 2080, 
2238, 2260, 2271, 2287.  Quod cogitatio Domini ex doctrina fidei significetur per quod `dixit Abimelech ad Abrahamum,' at perceptio quae responsum, per quod `(t)dixit Abrahamus,' ita se habet: perceptio 
est superius et fuit Domino ex ipso Divino, sed cogitatio est inferius, et fuit Domino ex ipso intellectuali; et quia perceptio erat ex qua cogitatio, ita {2} responsum cogitationis erat ex perceptione; 
hoc illustrari potest per aliquod instar apud hominem; homo caelestis non `potest cogitare' nisi ex {3} perceptione, et homo spiritualis non nisi ex {3} conscientia, n. 2515; perceptio illius 
sicut conscientia est ex Domino, et non ipsi apparet unde est, sed cogitatio ejus est ex rationali et apparet ei sicut ex se; ita quoque cum cogitat de aliqua re ex rationali, tunc conclusio cogitationis 
seu responsum venit ex perceptione seu ex conscientia; proinde respondetur ei a Domino secundum statum ejus vitae, affectionem, et doctrinae verum conformiter implantatum seu impressum. 	@1 i quod 
sit percipere et cogitare.$ 	@2 inde.$ 	@3 i quam.$ </p>
