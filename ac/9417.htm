<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9417节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9417.</strong>“并律法和诫命”表真理，无论总体还是具体。这从“律法”和“诫命”的含义清楚可知：“律法”是指总体的真理；“诫命”是指具体的真理。在圣言中，律法被分成了“诫命”、“典章”和“律例”；其中“诫命”表示生活的律法，“典章”表示公民国家的律法，而“律例”表示敬拜的律法（<a href="8972.htm">8972</a>节）。然而，所有这些一起被统称为“律法”；律法的具体要求被称为“诫命”，这从圣言中的许多经文明显看出来。正因如此，当提到“律法和诫命”时，所表示的是总体和具体的真理。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9417</b></p><p><b>9417.</b>
And the law and the commandment. That this signifies truth in general and in particular, is evident from the signification of "the law," as being truth in general; and from the signification of "the 
commandment," as being truth in particular. In the Word a distinction is made between "commandments," "judgments," and "statutes;" and by "commandments" are meant those things which are of life, by "judgments" 
those which are of the civil state, and by "statutes" those which are of worship (n. 8972). But all these are called by the general term "law;" and the particulars of the law are called "commandments," 
as is evident from many passages in the Word. Consequently when mention is made of "law and commandment," there is meant truth in general and in particular. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9417</b></p><p><b>9417.</b>
'And the law and the commandment' means truth in general and in particular. This is clear from the meaning of 'the law' as truth in general; and from the meaning of 'the commandment' as truth in particular. 
In the Word laws are divided up into commandments, judgements, and statutes, 'commandments' being used to mean laws of life, 'judgements' to mean laws of the civic state, and 'statutes' to mean 
laws of worship, <a href="8972.htm">8972</a>. However, all these together are called by the general term 'the law', and the individual requirements of the law are called 'commandments', as is clear from a large number of 
places in the Word. So it is that when the expression 'the law and the commandment' is used, truth in general and in particular is meant.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 9417</b>
</p><b>9417.</b>
`Et legem et praeceptum':  quod significet verum in communi et in particulari, constat ex significatione `legis' quod sit verum in communi, et ex significatione `praecepti' quod sit verum in particulari; 
in Verbo distinguitur inter praecepta, judicia, et statuta, et per `praecepta' intelliguntur illa quae sunt vitae, per `judicia' quae sunt status civilis, et per `statuta' quae sunt cultus, n. 8972; 
sed omnia illa communi voce vocantur lex, et singula quae legis sunt vocantur praecepta, prout ex pluribus locis in Verbo constat; inde est cum dicitur `lex et praeceptum,' quod intelligatur verum 
in communi et in particulari. </p>
