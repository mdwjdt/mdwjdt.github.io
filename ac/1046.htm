<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1046节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1046.</strong>创世记9:14-15.我使云彩遮盖地的时候，必有彩虹现在云彩中，我便记念在我与你们并凡有血肉的一切活的灵魂之间所立的约，诸水就不会再成为洪水，毁灭一切有血肉的了。<br />“我使云彩遮盖地的时候”表当由于人的自我中心的意愿部分，仁之信没有出现的时候。“必有彩虹现在云彩中”表人尚能重生之时。“我便记念在我与你们之间所立的约”表主尤其怜悯已重生之人和能重生之人。“凡有血肉的一切活的灵魂”表整个人类。“诸水就不会再成为洪水，毁灭一切有血肉的了”表人心智的觉知部分不可能再充满使他象上古教会的最后一代那样灭亡的那类信念了。这几节经文涉及总体上的所有人。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1046.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1046/bible_king-james-version_genesis_9_14-15" target=_top>Genesis 9:14-15</a>. "And it will happen in my clouding the earth over with cloud that a bow will be seen in the cloud. And I will remember my pact, which is between me and you and every living soul within all flesh, and no more will there be water as a flood to destroy all flesh."<br />And it will happen in my clouding the earth over with cloud means when our self-will blocks any view of a loving faith. That a bow will be seen in the cloud means when we are nevertheless the kind of people who can be reborn. And I will remember my pact, which is between me and you, symbolizes the Lord's mercy, specifically toward people who have been and people who can be reborn. And every living soul within all flesh symbolizes the entire human race. And no more will there be water as a flood to destroy all flesh means that our intellectual faculty will no longer be able to absorb delusions so terrible that it will be destroyed, as the descendants of the earliest church were.<br />These things have to do with all people in general. </p>

Verses 14, 15. And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud, and I will remember My covenant, which is between Me and you and every living soul 
of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. "And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth" signifies when on account of the Own of man's will 
part the faith of charity does not appear; "that the bow shall be seen in the cloud" signifies when man is still such that he can be regenerated; "and I will remember My covenant, which is between Me 
and you" signifies the mercy of the Lord specifically toward the regenerate and those who can be regenerated; "and every living soul of all flesh" signifies the whole human race; "and the waters shall 
no more become a flood to destroy all flesh" signifies that man's intellectual part should no more be able to put on such a persuasion for its destruction as did the posterity of the Most Ancient Church. 
These things regard all men in general. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1046</b></p><p><b>1046.</b>
Verses 14, 15 And when I cloud over the earth with cloud, and the bow is seen in the cloud, I will remember My covenant which is between Me and you and every living soul in all flesh. And the waters 
will no more be a flood to destroy all flesh.  </p>
<p>'And when I cloud over the earth with cloud' means a time when, the will part of man's proprium being what it is, faith that flows from charity does not 
appear. 'And the bow is seen in the cloud' means when man is still such as to be able to be regenerated. 'And I will remember My covenant which is between Me and you' means the Lord's mercy specifically 
towards those who have been regenerated, and those who are able to be. 'And with every living soul in all flesh' means the entire human race. 'And the waters will no more be a flood to destroy all 
flesh' means that it will not be possible any more for the understanding part of his mind to soak up the kind of persuasion that would cause him to perish as the [final] descendants of the Most Ancient 
Church did. These verses have regard to all people in general. </p>

</p><b>1046.</b>
Vers. 14, 15.  Et erit in obnubilando Me nube super terram, et videtur arcus in nube. Et recordabor foederis Mei, quod inter Me et inter vos, et inter omnem animam vivam in omni carne; et non erit amplius 
aquae in diluvium ad perdendum omnem carnem. 'Et erit in obnubilando Me nube super terram' significat quando propter proprium voluntarium hominis non apparet fides charitatis: 'et videtur arcus 
in nube' significat quando usque homo talis est ut regenerari queat: 'et recordabor foederis Mei, quod inter Me et inter vos' significat misericordiam Domini in specie erga regeneratos et qui regenerari 
possunt: 'et inter omnem animam vivam in omni carne' significat universum genus humanum: 'et non erit amplius aquae in diluvium ad perdendum omnem carnem' significat quod intellectuale ejus non amplius 
talem Persuasionem imbuere poterit ut pereat sicut posteritas Ecclesiae Antiquissimae. Haec spectant omnem hominem in genere. </p>
