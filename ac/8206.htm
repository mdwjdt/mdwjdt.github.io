<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8206节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8206.</strong>“水在他们的左右给他们作了墙垣”表他们被阻离四面八方的虚假。这从“水”、“给他们作墙垣”和“在他们的左右”的含义清楚可知：“水”，即红海的水，是指由邪恶所生的虚假（参看<a href="8137.htm">8137</a>，<a href="8138.htm">8138</a>节）；“给他们作墙垣”是指被阻离这些虚假，如下文所述；“在他们的左右”是指四面八方。当论及表示虚假的水时，“给他们作墙垣”之所以表示被阻离虚假，是因为人的处境是这样：当一个人被主保守在良善和真理中时，虚假和邪恶就被移除；它们被移除后像一堵墙那样立在他周围，因为它们无法进入良善和真理所在的区域。原因在于，主存在于良善和真理中，主的同在会将邪恶和虚假驱逐到周边；因为良善和真理与邪恶和虚假完全对立，故无法与它们共存，否则彼此就会毁灭对方。<br />伴随真理的良善的确会摧毁，也就是移除伴随虚假的邪恶，因为前者来自神，因而拥有一切能力，而后者来自地狱，因而根本没有能力。前者作用于内在层面，而后者作用于外在层面。当与人同在的伴随虚假的邪恶被移除时，它们就像一堵墙那样立在他周围，如前所述。它们不断企图冲进他里面，但无法做到，因为在良善和真理里面的主之同在赶走他们。这一切就是在他们左右给他们作墙垣的水所表示的。人通过被主保守在良善和真理中而被阻离邪恶和虚假（参看<a href="1581.htm">1581</a>，<a href="2406.htm">2406</a>，<a href="4564.htm">4564</a>节）。然而，没有人能被阻离邪恶，被保守在良善中，除非他通过在世上实行仁爱而接受这种能力。这一切通过良善的生活，或照信之真理所过的生活，因而通过对良善的情感或爱实现。通过自己所过的生活而拥有对良善的爱和情感的人就能处于良善和真理的气场；但通过自己所过的生活披上邪恶性质的人则不能。</p>

And the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left. That this signifies that they were withheld from falsities on every side, is evident from the signification of "the waters" 
of that sea, as being falsities from evil (see n. 8137, 8138); from the signification of "were a wall to them," as being to be withheld from them (of which below); and from the signification of "on their 
right hand and on their left," as being on every side. That "to be a wall to them," when said of waters by which are signified falsities, denotes to be withheld from falsities, is because the case 
with man is this. When a man is kept by the Lord in good and truth, then falsities and evils are removed, and being removed they stand round like a wall, for they cannot enter into the sphere where good 
and truth are. The reason is, that in good and truth the Lord is present, and the presence of the Lord puts away evil and falsity on every side; for good and truth are absolutely opposite to evil 
and falsity, and therefore they cannot be together without one destroying the other. But indeed good with truth destroys, that is, removes, evil with falsity, because the former is Divine and consequently 
has all power, whereas the latter is infernal and consequently has no power. The former acts from things internal, but the latter from things external. When evils with falsities are removed in a 
man, they as before said stand round like a wall, and are in the perpetual endeavor to rush in; but this they cannot do, because the presence of the Lord, which is in good and truth, wards them off. This 
is what is signified by the waters being a wall unto them on their left hand and on their right. That man is withheld from evil and falsity by being kept in good and truth by the Lord, see n. 1581, 
2406, 4564. But no one can be withheld from evil and kept in good, unless he has received this capacity by means of the exercise of charity in the world. This is effected by means of a life of good, 
or a life according to the truths of faith, consequently by means of the affection or love of good. He who by reason of his life has the love and affection of good, can be in the sphere of good and truth; 
but not he who by his life has put on a nature of evil. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8206</b></p><p><b>8206.</b>
'And the waters were a wall for them on their right and on their left' means that they were held back from falsities on every side. This is clear from the meaning of 'the waters' - the waters of that 
sea - as falsities arising from evil, dealt with in <a href="8137.htm">8137</a>, <a href="8138.htm">8138</a>; from the meaning of 'being a wall for them' as being held back from those falsities, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'on their 
right and on their left' as on every side. The reason why 'being a wall for them' - when said of 'the waters', by which falsities are meant - denotes being held back from falsities is that the situation 
with a person is as follows: When he is maintained by the Lord in goodness and truth falsities and evils are removed. Having been removed they stand around him like a wall, for they cannot enter 
the area where goodness and truth are. The reason for this is that goodness and truth have the Lord present within them, and the Lord's presence repels evil and falsity, on every side; for goodness and 
truth are the complete opposites of evil and falsity and therefore cannot exist together with them without one destroying the other. </p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Goodness accompanied by truth destroys, that is, removes evil 
accompanied by falsity, because goodness is from God and consequently possesses all power, whereas evil is from hell and therefore possesses no power at all. Goodness acts on internal levels, whereas 
evil acts on external ones. When the evils accompanied by falsities residing with a person are removed they stand around him, as stated, like a wall. They are constantly attempting to rush in on him, 
but they cannot do so because the Lord's presence, residing in the goodness and truth, holds them back. These are the considerations meant by the waters being like a wall for them on the left and on 
the right. Regarding a person's being held back from evil and falsity through being maintained by the Lord in goodness and truth, see <a href="1581.htm">1581</a>, <a href="2406.htm">2406</a>, <a href="4564.htm">4564</a>. Yet no one can be held back from evil and maintained 
in good unless he has received that ability through exercising charity in the world. A life of good, that is, a life led in accordance with the truths of faith, and therefore an affection for or 
a love of good, achieves this. The person who has a love of and affection for good as a result of the life he leads can be in a sphere of goodness and truth, but not one who through the life he leads 
has taken on the nature of evil. </p>

`Et aquae illis murus a dextra illorum et a sinistra illorum': quod significet quod a falsis detenti fuerint undequaque, constat ex significatione `aquarum,' nempe illius maris, quod sint falsa ex malo, 
de qua n. {1}8137, 8138; ex significatione `esse illis murus' quod sit detineri ab illis, de qua sequitur; et a significatione `a dextra illorum et a sinistra illorum' quod sit undequaque.  Quod 
`esse illis murus,' cum de aquis, per quas significantur falsa, `dicitur,' sit detineri a falsis, est quia ita cum homine se habet: is cum a Domino tenetur in {2}bono et vero, tunc falsa et mala removentur, 
{3}ac remota circumstant sicut murus, {4} ingredi enim in sphaeram ubi {5}bonum et verum non possunt; causa est quia in {2}bono et vero (t)Dominus est praesens, et praesentia Domini amovet undequaque 
{6}malum et falsum, bonum enim et verum sunt prorsus opposita malo et falso, 2 quare non simul possunt esse quin unum destruat alterum; sed bonum cum vero destruit, hoc est, removet malum cum falso, 
quia illud Divinum est, {7}et inde omnem potentiam habet, hoc autem infernale {8}ac ideo nihil potentiae habet; illud ab internis agit, hoc autem ab externis; (m)cum removentur {9} mala cum falsis 
apud hominem, sicut murus, ut dictum est, circumstant, (c)ac in perpetuo conatu irruendi sunt, sed irruere non possunt quia praesentia Domini, quae est in bono et vero, arcet {10};(n) haec sunt quae 
significantur per quod `aquae illis essent sicut murus a sinistra et a dextra.'  Quod homo detineatur a malo et falso per quod teneatur in bono et vero a Domino, videatur n. 1581, 2406, 4564; sed a 
malo detineri et in bono teneri nemo potest nisi {11} per exercitium charitatis in mundo {12}receperat illam facultatem; vita boni seu vita secundum vera fidei hoc facit, inde affectio seu amor boni; 
{13} is cui amor et affectio boni ex vita {14} potest in sphaera boni et veri esse, {15} non autem {16}ille qui per vitam {17}induerat naturam mali. 	@1 3137, 8138, IT  cp n. 8200 footnote 1.$ 	@2 vero
