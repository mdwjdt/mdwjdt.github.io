<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第481节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>481.</strong>创世记5:3 亚当活到一百三十岁，生了一个儿子，形像样式和自己相似，就给他起名叫塞特。<br />“一百三十岁”表示一个新教会兴起前的时期，由于该教会与上古教会略有不同，便说“形像样式和自己相似”。然而，此处的“样式”与信相关，“形像”与爱相关。该教会被称作“塞特”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]481.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_481/bible_king-james-version_genesis_5_3" target=_top>Genesis 5:3</a>. And the human lived one hundred thirty years, and he fathered [a child] in his likeness, after his image, and called his name Seth.<br />One hundred thirty years symbolizes the interval before the new church came into being. Because this church was not very different from the earliest one, it says that it was born in his likeness and after his image; but a likeness now has regard to faith and an image to love. This church was referred to as Seth. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 481</b></p><p><b>481.</b>
Verse 3. And Man lived a hundred and thirty years, and begat into his likeness, after his image, and called his name Seth. By a "hundred and thirty years" there is signified the time before the rise 
of a new church, which, being not very unlike the Most Ancient, is said to be born "into its likeness, and after its image;" but the term "likeness" has relation to faith, and "image" to love. This church 
was called "Seth." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 481</b></p><p><b>481.</b>
Verse 7 And Man lived a hundred and thirty years. And he beget in his own likeness, according to his own image, and called his name Seth.  </p>
<p>'A hundred and thirty years' means the period of time prior 
to the rise of a new Church which, being little different from the Most Ancient Church, is said to have been 'born in his likeness, and according to his image.' 'Likeness' however has regard to faith 
and 'image' to love. This Church was called Seth.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 481</b>
</p><b>481.</b>
Vers. 3.  Et vixit Homo triginta et centum annis; et genuit ii similitudinem suam, secundum imaginem suam; et vocatur nomen ejus Sheth.  Per 'triginta et centum annos' significatur tempus antequam nova 
Ecclesia orta, quae quia non ita absimilis fuit Antiquissimae dicitur quod 'nata in similitudinem ejus, et secundum imaginem ejus' sed 'similitudo' spectat fidem et 'imago' amorem; haec Ecclesia dicta 
est 'Sheth.' </p>
