<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3858节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3858.</strong>由于接下来的几节论述的主题是雅各的十二个儿子，并且以色列的十二支派以他们的名字命名，并以他们为祖，故此处预先说明支派是什么意思，为何有十二个。至今无人知道其中所隐藏的奥秘，因为人们一直以为，圣言的历史纯粹是历史，除了讨论神圣事物时能用来当例子外，再没有更多神性之物在里面。因此，他们还以为，这十二支派无非表示以色列人被划分为众多民族或普通宗族，而事实上，这些支派包含神性之物。也就是说，这些支派表示信与爱的众多普遍划分，因而表示构成主在天上和地上国度的事物。每个支派则具有表示某种普遍划分。不过，至于准确来说，各个支派分别表示什么，这从接下来的几节明显可知，这几节论述了雅各的儿子们，这些支派就是以他儿子们的名字命名的。总的来说，这十二支派表示构成真理与良善，或信与爱的教义的一切事物；这些（也就是真理与良善，或信与爱）构成主的国度；因为真理或信的事物本质上就是那里思维的全部，良善或爱的事物本质上是情感的全部。并且由于犹太教会的建立是为了它可以代表主的国度，故那百姓被划分为十二支派就表示主国度的这些事。这是此前从未披露的一个奥秘。<br />“十二”表示总体上的全部事物，如前所示（<a href="577.htm">577</a>，<a href="2089.htm">2089</a>，<a href="2129.htm">2129</a>，<a href="2130.htm">2130</a>，<a href="3272.htm">3272</a>节）；而“支派”表示真理与良善，或信与爱的事物，因此“十二支派”表示这些的全部事物。在分别描述“十二支派”之前，它们的这层含义在此通过圣言来证明。启示录：<br />圣城新耶路撒冷有十二个门，门上有十二位天使，门上又写着以色列人十二个支派的名字。城墙有十二根基，根基上有羔羊十二使徒的名字。他用苇子量那城，共有一万二千斯他丢；又量了城墙，按着人的尺寸，就是天使的尺寸，共有一百四十四肘。十二个门是十二颗珍珠。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.12.htm">21:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.16.htm">16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.17.htm">17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.21.htm">21</a>）<br />“圣城”，或新耶路撒冷表示主的新教会，这一点从这段描述的每个细节明显看出来。此前几章描述了教会在终结之前会是何状态；这一章则论述了一个新教会。因此，“门”、“城墙”和“根基”无非表示构成教会的事物，就是仁与信的事物，因为这些构成教会。<br />谁都能由此看出，上述经文频繁提到的“十二”，以及“支派”，还有“使徒”并非指十二、支派或使徒，“十二”是指在一个整体中的全部事物（参看<a href="577.htm">577</a>，<a href="2089.htm">2089</a>，<a href="2129.htm">2129</a>，<a href="2130.htm">2130</a>，<a href="3272.htm">3272</a>节）。“一百四十四”这个数字也一样，因为这个数字是十二乘十二。由于“十二”表示全部事物，故显然，“十二支派”表示构成教会的全部事物；这些事物就是真理与良善，或信与爱，如前所述。“十二使徒”同样如此，他们也代表教会的全部事物，也就是信与爱的全部事物（参看<a href="2129.htm">2129</a>，<a href="3354.htm">3354</a>，<a href="3488.htm">3488</a>，<a href="3857.htm">3857</a>节）。因此，这个数字被称为“人的尺寸，就是天使的尺寸”，以此表示真理与良善的一个状态。因为“尺寸”表示状态（参看<a href="3104.htm">3104</a>节）；“人”表示构成教会之物，这一点从有关“人”（man）这个含义的论述明显可知（<a href="478.htm">478</a>，<a href="479.htm">479</a>，<a href="565.htm">565</a>，<a href="768.htm">768</a>，<a href="1871.htm">1871</a>，<a href="1894.htm">1894</a>节），并且从以下事实也能看出来，即：主的国度被称作大人，它被如此称呼凭的是出自主的良善与真理。关于这个主题，可参看各章节的末尾（<a href="3624.htm">3624</a>-<a href="3649.htm">3649</a>，<a href="3741.htm">3741</a>-<a href="3750.htm">3750</a>节）。“天使”也有同样的含义（参看<a href="1705.htm">1705</a>，<a href="1754.htm">1754</a>，<a href="1925.htm">1925</a>，<a href="2821.htm">2821</a>，<a href="3039.htm">3039</a>节）。<br />和启示录一样，旧约的先知书所论述的新耶路撒冷同样表示主的新教会，如以赛亚书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.18.htm">65:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.19.htm">19</a>等）；撒迦利亚书（14章）；尤其以西结书（40-48章），在那里，新耶路撒冷、新殿和新地在内义上描述了主在天上的国度，以及主在地上的国度，也就是教会。以西结书的这些章节比别处更清楚地表明“地”、“耶路撒冷”和“圣殿”，以及它们里面的一切事物是什么意思，还有“十二支派”表示什么。因为这些章节所论述的主题就是那地和那地的居民照着各支派的划分，以及那城和城墙，根基、门和属于那里圣殿的一切事物。我们在此只能从这些章节引用关于支派的内容：<br />主耶和华说，这是你们按以色列十二支派分地为业的地界。你们要按着以色列的支派分这地。要拈阄分这地为业，归与自己和你们中间寄居的外人。他们在以色列支派中要同你们拈阄分得产业。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.13.htm">47:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.21.htm">21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.23.htm">23</a>）<br />至于这地：<br />这地在以色列中必归王为业；我所立的王必不再欺压我的民，他们却要按支派将地分给以色列家。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结45.8.htm">45:8</a>）<br />关于这产业，以及它们如何分配给那里也以名字所提及的各个支派，可参看以西结书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/结48.1.htm">48:1</a>等）。关于以以色列的支派命名的城门，可参看同一章（48:31-34）。<br />很明显，那里所说的“支派”不是指支派，因为那时，十个支派早已分散到世界各地，并且后来也没有回来。他也不可能回来，因为他们已然变成外邦人了。然而，每个支派都提到了，以及他们应如何分这地，各自的地界是哪份，即：但支派的地界是哪份（48:2）；亚设支派的地界是哪份（48:3）；拿弗他利，玛拿西，以法莲，流便，犹大的地界又是哪份；利未人的产业；便雅悯，西缅，以萨迦，西布伦，迦得的地界是哪份（48:4-29）。另外，该章还声明那城有十二个城门，按以色列支派的名字命名：北面有三门，即流便门、犹大门、利未门；东面有三门，即约瑟门、便雅悯门、但门；南面有三门，即西缅门、以萨迦门、西布伦门；西面有三门，即迦得门、亚设门、拿弗他利门（48: 31-34）。由此明显可知，“十二支派”表示属于主国度的全部事物，或信与爱的全部事物，因为如前所述，这些构成主的国度。<br />“十二支派”因表示主国度的一切事物，故也以其营地和起行而代表该国度。对此，我们在摩西五经中读到：他们要按着各支派对着会幕的四围安营；在东边，有犹大、以萨迦、西布伦；在南边，有流便、西缅、迦得；在西边，有以法莲、玛拿西、便雅悯；在北边，有但、亚设、拿弗他利；他们就这样安营起行（民数记2章）。他们在这一切事上都代表主的国度，这一点从巴兰的预言中很明显地看出来：<br />巴兰举目，看见以色列人照着支派居住，神的灵就临到他身上。他便题起诗歌说，雅各啊，你的会幕何等华美！以色列啊，你的居所何其华丽！如接连的山谷，如河旁的园子，如耶和华所栽的沉香木，如水边的香柏树。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.2.htm">24:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.6.htm">6</a>）<br />巴兰通过耶和华说这些话，这一事实在民数记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/民22.8.htm">22:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民22.18.htm">18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民22.19.htm">19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民22.35.htm">35</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民22.38.htm">38</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.5.htm">23:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.12.htm">12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.16.htm">16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.26.htm">26</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.2.htm">24:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.13.htm">13</a>）中说得很清楚。<br />由此明显可知按着各支派所得的迦南地业代表什么，对此，我们在摩西五经中读到：摩西要将以色列人的全会众，按他们的父家，凡二十岁以外能加入以色列军队的，计算总数；那地要拈阄分；他们要按着祖宗各支派的名字承受为业（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民26.2.htm">26:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民26.7.htm">7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民26.56.htm">56</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民33.54.htm">33:54</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民34.19.htm">34:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民34.29.htm">29</a>）。约书亚按着支派拈阄分地（约书亚记13，15-19）。从这些具体细节明显可知，所代表的是主的国度，如前所述；因为“迦南地”表示该国度（参看<a href="1585.htm">1585</a>，<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="3038.htm">3038</a>，<a href="3481.htm">3481</a>，<a href="3705.htm">3705</a>节）。<br />以色列人被称为“军队”，经上说他们要按着“军队”安营，并且还要按着“军队”起行（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民2.4.htm">2:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民2.6.htm">6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民2.8.htm">8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民2.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民2.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民2.15.htm">15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民2.19.htm">19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民2.21.htm">21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民2.23.htm">23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民2.26.htm">26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民2.28.htm">28</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民2.30.htm">30</a>）。这是因为，“军队”有同样的含义（和“支派”一样），即表示真理与良善（参看<a href="3448.htm">3448</a>节）。而且，主就被称为“万军之耶和华”（Jehovah Zebaoth），或“众军之耶和华”（Jehovah of Armies）（<a href="3448.htm">3448</a>节）。因此，他们在出埃及时，被称为“耶和华的军队”，如摩西五经：<br />正当四百三十年终了的这一天，耶和华的军队都从埃及地出来了。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.41.htm">12:41</a>）<br />谁都能意识到，在埃及和之后的旷野，这百姓除了以一种代表意义外，并未称作“耶和华的军队”，因为他们没有良善或真理，反而是所有民族中最坏的。<br />由此也很清楚地明白被称作乌陵和土明的亚伦胸牌上的“十二支派的名字”表示什么。关于这胸牌，我们在摩西五经中读到：<br />要在上面镶上四行，宝石要有十二块，这些宝石要按着以色列儿子的名字，十二块都要按着他们的名字；各在名字上为十二个支派刻印章。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.17.htm">28:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.21.htm">21</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出39.14.htm">39:14</a>）<br />因为亚伦代表主的神性祭司职份，因此他作为大祭司所穿戴的一切都表示神性属天和属灵之物。至于它们的确切含义，蒙主的神圣怜悯，等到论述它们的时候就会清楚明了。胸牌本身是最神圣的，所以它的名字代表了对主之爱和信的一切本质特征：这些就是乌陵和土明。名字之所以被刻在宝石上，是因为“石”一般表示真理（<a href="1298.htm">1298</a>，<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>节），而“宝石”表示从良善透现出来的真理（<a href="114.htm">114</a>节）。由于各支派的名字表示某种本质特征，故每个支派都分配了一种具体的石头（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.17.htm">28:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.20.htm">20</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出39.10.htm">39:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出39.13.htm">13</a>），这种石头凭颜色和透明度来表现每个支派所表示的品质。这就是耶和华或主如何通过乌陵和土明给出答复。<br />以弗得两条肩带上的“两块红玛瑙石”所代表的也一样，只是比胸牌上的十二样宝石所代表的更低级。因为“肩”表一切能力，因而表主的全能（<a href="1085.htm">1085</a>节）；而“胸”或“心与肺”表神性属天和属灵之爱；“心”表神性属天之爱；“肺”表神性属灵之爱；这一切可参看前文（<a href="3635.htm">3635</a>节）和本章末尾，那里论述了大人，以及它与心肺区域的对应关系。关于“以弗得肩带上的两块石头”，我们在摩西五经中读到：<br />要取两块红玛瑙石，在上面刻以色列儿子的名字，六个名字在这块宝石上，六个名字在那块宝石上，都照他们出生的次序。要将这两块石头安在以弗得的肩带上，为以色列人作纪念石。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.9.htm">28:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.10.htm">10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.12.htm">12</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出39.6.htm">39:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出39.7.htm">7</a>）<br />支派表示属于真理和良善，或信和爱之物，并且每个支派都表示其某种共性，利未支派表示爱（这从下面34节的解释明显看出来）。故由此可知，他们各自按着各支派把杖存在会幕内，并且唯独利未的杖开花结熟杏是什么意思。对此，我们在摩西五经中读到：<br />取十二根杖，他们父家的族长要各有一根杖，要把这些杖存在会幕内；并要将亚伦的名字写在利未的杖上。亚伦的杖也在这些杖当中。第二天，看哪，利未支派亚伦的杖已经发了芽，生了花苞，开了花，结了熟杏。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民17.2.htm">17:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民17.8.htm">8</a>）<br />这些事表示，爱是主国度中全部事物的本质和首要事物，爱是一切结实的源头。之所以将亚伦的名字写在杖上，是因为亚伦代表主的神性祭司职份。主的祭司职份表示神性良善，神性良善本质上就是主的爱与仁慈；主的王权则表示源自神性良善的神性真理（参看<a href="1728.htm">1728</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="3670.htm">3670</a>节）。<br />从目前所引证的这一切可以看出，以下经文中的“支派”和“十二支派”表示什么。启示录：<br />我听见受印的数目有十四万四千，都是以色列人各支派中受印的。犹大支派中受印的有一万二千；流便支派中有一万二千；迦得支派中有一万二千；亚设支派中有一万二千；拿弗他利支派中有一万二千；玛拿西支派中有一万二千；西缅支派中有一万二千；利未支派中有一万二千；以萨迦支派中有一万二千；西布伦支派中有一万二千；约瑟支派中有一万二千；便雅悯支派中受印的有一万二千。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启7.4.htm">7:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启7.8.htm">8</a>）<br />摩西五经：<br />你当追想上古之日，思念历代之年。至高者将地业赐给列族，将世人分开，就照以色列人的数目，立定万民的疆界。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.7.htm">32:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.8.htm">8</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />耶路撒冷被建造，如同连络整齐的一座城。众支派，就是耶和华的支派，上那里去，以色列的证据，称赞耶和华的名。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗122.3.htm">122:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗122.4.htm">4</a>）<br />约书亚记：<br />看哪！全地之主的约柜必在你们的前面过去，到约旦河里。你们要从以色列支派中拣选十二个人，每支派一人。当抬耶和华全地之主约柜的祭司，脚掌踏入约旦河水里的时候，约旦河的水，必然中断，立起成垒。（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书3.11.htm">3:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/书3.13.htm">13</a>）<br /><br />你们从约旦河中间、祭司脚站定的地方，取十二块石头带过去，按着以色列人十二支派的数目，每人取一块石头扛在肩上；这可作约旦河的水中断的记号。约书亚另把十二块石头立在约旦河中间，在抬约柜的祭司脚站立的地方。（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书4.3.htm">4:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/书4.9.htm">9</a>）<br /><br />以利亚照雅各子孙支派的数目，取了十二块石头，耶和华的话曾临到雅各说，你的名要叫以色列；他就用这些石头奉耶和华的名筑一座坛。（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上18.31.htm">18:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上18.32.htm">32</a>）<br />“支派”表爱之善和信之真，这一点也可从主在马太福音中的话明显看出来：<br />那时，人子的兆头要显现，地上的众支派都要哀哭。他们要看见人子有能力，有大荣耀，驾着天上的云降临。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.30.htm">24:30</a>）<br />此处“地上的众支派都要哀哭”表示对真理的承认和良善的生命不复存在，因为所论述的主题是时代的终结。同样，在启示录：<br />看哪！祂驾云降临，众目要看见祂，连刺祂的人也要看见他，地上的众支派都要因祂哀哭。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.7.htm">1:7</a>）<br />“驾着天上的云降临”表示什么，这可见于创世记18章的序言。另外，也可参看关于“十二”这个数字通过经历向我所作的指示（<a href="2129.htm">2129</a>，<a href="2130.htm">2130</a>节）。<br />信与爱的全部事物被称为“支派”的原因在于，这个词在原文也表示“权杖”和“杖”。“权杖”和“杖”表示权能，蒙主的神圣怜悯，这一点将在别处予以说明。因此，“支派”这个名词具有这样的观念：良善与真理拥有来自主的一切权能在里面。由于这个原因，天使还被称为“大能”（powers）和“王权”（sovereignties或principalities），因为“君王”（或族长princes）表示仁与信的首要事物，如源于以实玛利的“十二个族长” （创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创25.16.htm">25:16</a>，参看<w1>2089<w2>2089<w3>节），以及作为支派领袖的族长（民数记七章；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民13.4.htm">13:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民13.16.htm">16</a>）。<br />从关于十二支派的所有上述内容可知，为何后来被称作“使徒”的主的门徒共有十二个；和支派一样，他们代表主教会的良善与真理（<a href="2129.htm">2129</a>，<a href="3354.htm">3354</a>，<a href="3488.htm">3488</a>，<a href="3857.htm">3857</a>节）。“彼得”代表信，“雅各”代表仁，“约翰”代表仁爱的行为（参看18至22章的序言，以及<a href="3750.htm">3750</a>节）。这一点也可从主论到他们并对他们所说的话很清楚地看出来。</p>

As in what now follows the twelve sons of Jacob are treated of, and the twelve tribes of Israel were named from them as their fathers, it is here to be premised what the tribes signify, and why there 
were twelve. No one has yet known the arcanum herein concealed, because it has been believed that the histories of the Word are bare histories, and that there is no more of the Divine therein than that 
they can serve as examples for the application of holy things. Hence also it has been believed that the twelve tribes signify nothing but divisions of the Israelitish people into so many distinct nations 
or general families, when yet they involve Divine things; that is to say, so many universal divisions of faith and love, consequently things relating to the Lord's kingdom in the heavens and on 
earth, each tribe involving some distinct universal; but what each signifies will appear from what presently follows, where the sons of Jacob are treated of, from whom these tribes were named. In general 
the twelve tribes signified all things of the doctrine of truth and good, or of faith and love; for these (that is, truth and good, or faith and love) constitute the Lord's kingdom; for the things 
of truth or faith are the all of thought therein, and the things of good or love are the all of affection; and because the Jewish Church was instituted in order that it might represent the Lord's kingdom, 
therefore the divisions of that people into twelve tribes signified these things. This is a mystery never before disclosed. [2] That "twelve" signifies all things in general, was shown above (n. 
577, 2089, 2129, 2130, 3272); but that "tribes" signify those things which are of truth and good, or of faith and love, thus that the "twelve tribes" signify all things of these, may be here confirmed 
from the Word, before they are described separately. In John: </p>
<p>     The holy city New Jerusalem had twelve gates, and over the gates twelve angels; and names written thereon which are the names of 
the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel; and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. He measured the city with the reed unto twelve thousand furlongs; and he measured the wall thereof, 
a hundred and forty and four cubits, which is the measure of a man, that is of an angel. The twelve gates were twelve pearls (Rev. 21:12, 14, 16-17, 21). That the holy city, or New Jerusalem, is the 
Lord's New Church, is manifest from all the particulars thereof. In some of the foregoing chapters the state of the church is described, as it would be before its end. This chapter treats of the New Church, 
and therefore the gates, wall, and foundations of the city are nothing else than things of the church, which are those of charity and faith, for these constitute the church. [3] Everyone can see 
that by the "twelve" so often mentioned in the above passage, and also by the "tribes," and likewise the "apostles," are not meant twelve, or tribes, or apostles, but by "twelve" all things in one 
complex (as may be seen above, n. 577, 2089, 2129, 2130, 3272); and in like manner by the number "a hundred and forty and four," for this is twelve times twelve. And as by "twelve" are signified all things, 
it is evident that by the "twelve tribes" are signified all things of the church; which as before said are truths and goods, or faith and love; and in like manner by the "twelve apostles," who 
also represented all things of the church, that is, all things of faith and love (as may be seen above, n. 2129, 3354, 3488, 3857. This number is therefore called the "measure of a man, that is, of an 
angel," by which is meant a state of truth and good. (That "measure" signifies state, see above, n. 3104. That "man" signifies that which is of the church, is evident from what was said above concerning 
the signification of "man," n. 478, 479, 565, 768, 1871, 1894; and also from the fact that the Lord's kingdom is called the Grand Man, and this by virtue of good and truth which are from the Lord, 
on which subject see at the close of the chapters, n. 3624-3648, 3741-3750. That "angel" signifies the same, may be seen above, n. 1705, 1754, 1925, 2821, 3039.) [4] As in John, so also in the Prophets 
of the Old Testament is the New Jerusalem treated of, and there in like manner it signifies the Lord's New Church-as in Isa. 65:18-19 seq.; in Zech. 14; especially in Ezek. 40-48; where by the "New 
Jerusalem," the "new temple," and the "new earth," are described in the internal sense the Lord's kingdom in the heavens, and His kingdom on earth which is the church. From what is said in these chapters 
in Ezekiel it is plainer than elsewhere what is signified by "earth," by "Jerusalem," by "temple," and by all things therein, and also what by the "twelve tribes;" for the division of the land is 
treated of, and its inheritance according to tribes, and also the city, its walls, foundations, and gates, and all things that will belong to the temple therein. From these passages we may here quote 
only what is said concerning the tribes: </p>
<p>     The Lord Jehovih said, This is the border whereby ye shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel. Ye shall divide this land according 
to the tribes of Israel. And it shall come to pass that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you, and to the sojourners who sojourn in the midst of you. They shall cast lot with you for 
an inheritance in the midst of the tribes of Israel (Ezek. 47:13, 21-23). As for the land, it shall be to the prince for a possession in Israel; and My princes shall no more afflict My people and they 
shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes (Ezek. 45:8). Concerning the inheritances, and how they were assigned to the several tribes, which are there also mentioned by 
name, see chap. 48:1, etc. And concerning the gates of the city, according to the names of the tribes of Israel, see the same chapter, verses 31 to 34. [5] That by "tribes" there, are not meant tribes, 
is very plain, for the ten tribes were already at that time dispersed through the whole earth, neither did they afterwards return, nor can they ever return, for they are become Gentiles; and yet mention 
is made of each tribe, and how they should inherit the land, and what should be the boundaries of each; namely, what boundary for the tribe of Dan (verse 2); what for the tribe of Asher (verse 3); 
what for Naphtali, Manasseh, Ephraim, Reuben, Judah; what should be the inheritance of the Levites; what the boundary of Benjamin; what of Simeon, of Issachar, of Zebulun, and of Gad (verses 4-29); 
also that the city should have twelve gates according to the names of the tribes of Israel; that three should be toward the north, for Reuben, Judah, and Levi; three toward the east, for Joseph, Benjamin, 
and Dan; three toward the south, for Simeon, Issachar, and Zebulun; and three toward the west, for Gad, Asher, and Naphtali (verses 31-34). Thus it is evident that by the "twelve tribes" are signified 
all things of the Lord's kingdom, or all things of faith and love, for these as before said constitute the Lord's kingdom.  [6] Because the "twelve tribes" signified all things of the Lord's kingdom, 
therefore also the twelve tribes by their encampments, and also by their journeyings, represented that kingdom. Concerning these we read in Moses that they should encamp according to the tribes 
around the tent of the assembly; toward the east, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun; toward the south, Reuben, Simeon, and Gad; toward the west, Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin; and toward the north, Dan, 
Asher, and Naphtali; and that as they encamped, so they journeyed (Num. 2). That in this they represented the Lord's kingdom, is very plain from the prophecy of Balaam: </p>
<p>     When Balaam lifted up his 
eyes, and saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes, the spirit of God came upon him, and he uttered his enunciation and said, How goodly are thy tabernacles, O Jacob, thy habitations, O Israel! 
As the valleys are they planted, as gardens by the river side, as the lignaloes which Jehovah hath planted, as cedar trees beside the waters (Num. 24:2-6). That Balaam spoke these words from Jehovah, 
is expressly stated (Num. 22:8, 18-19, 35, 38; 23:5, 12, 16, 26; 24:2, 13). [7] From all this it is evident what was represented by the inheritances of the land of Canaan according to the tribes, 
concerning which we read in Moses that Moses was to take the sum of the congregation of the sons of Israel according to their fathers' houses, from twenty years old, everyone that went forth into the 
army of Israel; and that the land should be distributed by lot; according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they should receive inheritance (Num. 26:7-56; 33:54; 34:19-29); and that the land 
was divided by Joshua, by lot, according to the tribes (Josh. 13, 15-19). That as before said the Lord's kingdom was thus represented is manifest from all the particulars; for the "land of Canaan" signifies 
this kingdom (see n. 1585, 1607, 3038, 3481, 3705). [8] The reason why the sons of Israel are called "armies," and it is said that they should "encamp according to their armies," and should "journey 
according to their armies" (Num. 2:4-30), is that an "army" signified the same, namely, truths and goods (see n. 3448); and the Lord is called "Jehovah Zebaoth," that is, "Jehovah of Armies" (n. 
3448). Hence they were called the "armies of Jehovah" when they went forth out of Egypt; as in Moses: </p>
<p>     It came to pass at the end of four hundred and thirty years, even the self-same day it came 
to pass, that all the armies of Jehovah went out from the land of Egypt (Exod. 12:41). It must be evident to everyone that they who were of such a quality in Egypt, and afterwards in the wilderness, 
were called the "armies of Jehovah" only representatively, for they were in no good or truth, being the worst of all nations. [9] From the same ground it is very plain what is signified by the "names 
of the twelve tribes" in Aaron's breastplate, which was called the Urim and Thummim, concerning which we read in Moses that there should be four rows therein, that there should be twelve stones, and 
these stones according to the names of the sons of Israel, twelve according to their names; and that the engravings of a signet should be to each over its name for the twelve tribes (Exod. 28:21; 39:14); 
for Aaron represented the Lord's Divine priesthood; for which reason all the things with which he was invested signified Divine celestial and spiritual things. But what they signified will of the 
Lord's Divine mercy appear where they are treated of. In the breast plate itself, inasmuch as it was most holy, there were representations of all things that are of love and faith in the Lord: these 
are the Urim and Thummim. The reason why the names were engraved on precious stones was that "stones" in general signify truths (n. 1298, 3720); and "precious stones," truths which are transparent from 
good (n. 114); and as the "names" of the several tribes signified the quality, therefore a particular kind of stone was assigned for each tribe (Exod. 28:17-20; 39:8, 10-13), which stone by its color 
and transparency expressed the quality that was signified by each tribe; hence it was that Jehovah or the Lord gave answers by the Urim and Thummim.  [10] By the "two onyx stones" that were on the 
two shoulders of the ephod were represented the same, but in a lesser degree than by the twelve stones on the breastplate; for the "shoulders" signified all power, thus the omnipotence of the Lord (n. 
1085); but the "breast," or the "heart and lungs," signified Divine celestial and spiritual love; the "heart," Divine celestial love; and the "lungs," Divine spiritual love; as may be seen above (n. 
3635), and at the end of this chapter, where the Grand Man is treated of, and its correspondence with the province of the heart and with that of the lungs. Concerning the "two stones on the shoulder 
of the ephod," we read in Moses: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt take two onyx stones, and grave on them the names of the sons of Israel; six of their names on the one stone, and the names of the six that remain on 
the other stone, according to their generations. Thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulders of the ephod, stones of memorial for the sons of Israel (Exod. 28:9-10, 12; 39:6-7). [11] Because the 
tribes signified what is of truth and good, or of faith and love, and each tribe signified some universal thereof, and the tribe of Levi signified love (as will appear from the explication of verse 
34 of this chapter), it may from this be known what was signified by placing rods, one for each tribe, in the tent of assembly, and by Levi's rod alone blossoming with almonds; concerning which we read 
in Moses: </p>
<p>     Take twelve rods, one rod for each head of their fathers' houses, and let them be left in the tent of meeting; and thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi. And the rod of 
Aaron was in the midst of the rods. On the morrow, behold the rod of Aaron for the tribe of Levi blossomed, and brought forth a blossom so that the flower flowered, and bare almonds (Num. 17:2-8); </p>
<p>this 
signified that love is the essential and the principal of all things in the Lord's kingdom, and that from it is all fructification. The reason why Aaron's name was upon it, was that Aaron represented 
the Lord as to His Divine priesthood. (That by the "Lord's priesthood" is signified the Divine good, which is of His love and mercy; and by the "Lord's royalty," the Divine truth which is from the 
Divine good, may be seen above, n. 1728, 2015, 3670.)  [12] From what has now been adduced it may be seen what "tribes" and "twelve tribes" signify in the following passages. In John: </p>
<p>     I heard the 
number of them which were sealed, a hundred forty and four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of Israel. Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand; of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve 
thousand; of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand; of the tribe of Asher were sealed twelve thousand; of the tribe of Naphtali were sealed twelve thousand; of the tribe of Manasseh were sealed 
twelve thousand; of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand; of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand; of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand; of the tribe of Zebulun 
were sealed twelve thousand; of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand; of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand (Rev. 7:4-8). In Moses: </p>
<p>     Remember the days of eternity; understand 
the years of generation and generation. When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, when He separated the sons of man, He set the bounds of the peoples according to the number of 
the sons of Israel (Deut. 32:7-8). In David: </p>
<p>     Jerusalem is built as a city which is compact together; whither the tribes go up, the tribes of Jah, a testimony unto Israel, to confess unto the name 
of Jehovah (Ps. 122:3-4). [13] In Joshua: </p>
<p>     Behold the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth before you into Jordan. Take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of 
every tribe a man. And it shall come to pass, when the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of Jehovah, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of 
Jordan shall be cut off; they shall stand in one heap (Josh. 3:11-13). Again: </p>
<p>     Take out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood ready, twelve stones, and carry them 
over with you, every man a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of Israel; that this may be a sign that the waters of Jordan were cut off. Moreover Joshua set up twelve stones 
in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests that bare the ark of the covenant stood (Josh. 4:3-9). Again: </p>
<p>     Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes 
of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of Jehovah came, saying, Israel shall be thy name; and he built an altar in the name of Jehovah (1 Kings 18:31-32). [14] That "tribes" signify the goods 
of love and truths of faith, is evident also from the Lord's words in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Then shall appear the sign of the Son of man and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the 
Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and glory (Matt. 24:30); </p>
<p>where by "all the tribes of the earth mourning," is signified that there would no longer be any acknowledgment of truth 
and of the life of good, for the subject treated of is the consummation of the age. In like manner in John: </p>
<p>     Behold He cometh with the clouds, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced 
Him and all the tribes of the earth shall mourn because of Him (Rev. 1:7). What is signified by "coming in the clouds of heaven" may be seen in the preface to the eighteenth chapter; see further 
what was shown me from experience concerning twelve (n. 2129, 2130).  [15] The reason why all things of faith and love are called "tribes," is that the same expression in the original tongue signifies 
also a "scepter" and a "staff." That a "scepter," and also a "staff," signifies power, will of the Lord's Divine mercy be shown elsewhere. Hence the name "tribe" involves in it that goods and truths 
have within them all power from the Lord. For this reason also the angels are called "powers," and likewise "sovereignties," for "princes" signify the primary things of charity and faith, as do the 
"twelve princes" descended from Ishmael (Gen. 25:16-see n. 2089, 3272), and also the "princes" who presided over the tribes (Num. 7; 13:4-16). [16] From what has been hitherto said concerning the twelve 
tribes, it may be known why the Lord's disciples, who were afterwards called "apostles," were twelve in number; and that they represented the church of the Lord as to goods and truths in like manner 
as did the tribes (n. 2129, 3354, 3488, 3857). That Peter represented faith; James, charity; and John, the works of charity, may be seen above (preface to chapter 18 and to chapter 22, also n. 3750). 
This likewise is very plain from what the Lord said concerning them and to them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3858</b></p><p><b>3858.</b>
Since the subject in the verses that follow now is the twelve sons of Jacob, and since the twelve tribes of Israel were named after them as their fathers, let an introductory statement be made here about 
what the tribes mean and why there were twelve. Nobody as yet has known the arcanum lying within these considerations, for people have believed that the historical descriptions of the Word are purely 
history and hold nothing more of the Divine within them than their ability to be made to apply to matters of a holy nature when these are under discussion. Consequently they have also believed that 
the twelve tribes meant nothing else than the divisions of the Israelitish people into so many separate nations or general families, when in fact Divine realities are implied in those tribes. That 
is to say, those tribes mean so many universal divisions of faith and love and so mean things that constitute the Lord's kingdom in heaven and on earth, each tribe in particular meaning some universal 
division. But what exactly each tribe means will be evident from the verses that follow directly after this, where the subject is the sons of Jacob after whom the twelve tribes were named. In general 
the twelve tribes meant everything constituting the doctrine of truth and good, that is, of faith and love; for these - that is to say, truth and good, or faith and love - constitute the Lord's kingdom, 
since what are essentially matters of truth or faith constitute the whole of thought there, and what are essentially matters of good or love constitute the whole of affection. And because the Jewish 
Church was established so as to represent the Lord's kingdom the divisions of that people into twelve tribes therefore meant those things of His kingdom. This is an arcanum which has not previously 
been disclosed. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Twelve means all things in general, as shown already in <a href="577.htm">577</a>, <a href="2089.htm">2089</a>, <a href="2129.htm">2129</a>, <a href="2130.htm">2130</a> (end), <a href="3272.htm">3272</a>, while 'tribes' means matters of truth and good, or of faith and love, so that 'the twelve 
tribes' means all of these. Let this meaning of 'the twelve tribes' be substantiated here from the Word before each one is dealt with individually. In John, </p>
<blockquote>
The holy city New Jerusalem, having 
twelve gates, and above the gates twelve angels, and names written which are those of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel. The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the names of the 
twelve apostles of the Lamb. He measured the city with the measuring rod, twelve thousand stadia. And he measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, which is the measure of a man, that is, of 
an angel. The twelve gates were twelve pearls. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2021:12,%2014,%2016,%2017,%2021&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 21:12, 14, 16, 17, 21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The holy city', or the New Jerusalem, means the Lord's new Church, as is evident from each detail of this description. 
Previous chapters refer to what the condition of the Church was going to be like before its end; this chapter refers to a new Church. That being so, 'the gates', 'the wall', 'the foundations' mean nothing 
else than things constituting the Church, which are those of charity and faith since these constitute the Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From this it may be clear to anyone that 'twelve' used so many times in that 
description, also 'tribes', and 'apostles' too, are not used to mean twelve, or tribes, or apostles, but that 'twelve' is used to mean all things in their entirety; see what has been shown in <a href="577.htm">577</a>, <a href="2089.htm">2089</a>, <a href="2129.htm">2129</a>, <a href="2130.htm">2130</a> (end), <a href="3272.htm">3272</a>. The same is true of the number 'a hundred and forty-four', for this is twelve twelves. And since 'twelve' means all things it is evident that 'the twelve tribes' means all 
things constituting the Church, which, as stated above, are truth and good, or faith and love. The same is also true of 'the twelve apostles' who as well represented all things constituting the Church, 
that is, all things of faith and love, see <a href="2129.htm">2129</a>, <a href="3354.htm">3354</a>, <a href="3488.htm">3488</a>, <a href="3857.htm">3857</a>. That number is therefore called 'the measure of a man, that is, of an angel', by which is meant a state of truth and good. For 'measure' 
means state, see <a href="3104.htm">3104</a>, and 'man' means that which constitutes the Church, as is evident from things said about the meaning of 'man' in <a href="478.htm">478</a>, <a href="479.htm">479</a>, <a href="565.htm">565</a>, <a href="768.htm">768</a>, <a href="1871.htm">1871</a>, <a href="1894.htm">1894</a>, and also from the fact that 
the Lord's kingdom is called the Grand Man, which it is called by virtue of good and truth which come from the Lord, dealt with at the ends of chapters in <a href="3624.htm">3624</a>-<a href="3649.htm">3649</a>, <a href="3741.htm">3741</a>-<a href="3750.htm">3750</a>. And 'angel' has the

<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 As in John, so also in the Prophets, in the Old Testament Word, is the new Jerusalem referred to, where in a similar way the Lord's new Church is meant, 
as in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isaiah%2065:18,%2019&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isaiah 65:18, 19</a>, and following verses; in Zechariah <a href="14.htm">14</a>; and in particular in Ezekiel, Chapters <a href="40.htm">40</a>-<a href="48.htm">48</a>, where the new Jerusalem, the new Temple, and a new earth describe in the internal sense 
the Lord's kingdom in heaven, and the Lord's kingdom on earth, which is the Church. The contents of those chapters, plainer than anywhere else, show what 'earth', 'Jerusalem', 'Temple', and everything 
in them meant, and also what 'the twelve tribes' means. For the subject of those chapters is the division of the land and the inheritance of it according to tribes, as well as the city and its walls, 
foundation, and gates, and everything that was to go with the Temple there. From those chapters let simply matters relating to the tribes be quoted here, </p>
<p>The Lord Jehovih said, This is the boundary 
of your inheritance of the land, according to the twelve tribes of Israel. You shall divide this land according to the tribes of Israel. But you shall divide it by lot as an inheritance, and for sojourners 
sojourning in your midst. They shall cast lots with you for an inheritance in the midst of the tribes of Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2047:13,%2021-23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 47:13, 21-23</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
As regards the land, it will be for the prince as a possession 
in Israel. And the princes will no longer oppress My people, and the land they will give to the house of Israel according to their tribes. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2045:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 45:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Concerning inheritances and how they were 
assigned to individual tribes which are also referred to there by name, see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2048:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 48:1</a> 
</blockquote>
and following verses; and concerning the gates of the city which are named after the tribes of Israel, verses 
31-34 of the same chapter. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Quite plainly, when the tribes are spoken of here it is not the tribes who are meant, for by that time ten tribes had long since been scattered throughout the whole 
world, and had not subsequently returned. Nor can they possibly return, for they have become gentiles. And yet reference is made to each individual tribe, and to how it was to inherit the land and what 
its boundary was to be. What the boundary for the tribe of Dan was to be is stated in verse 2; what the boundary for the tribe of Asher was to be in verse 3; what those of Naphtali, Manasseh, Ephraim, 
Reuben, and Judah were to be, and concerning the inheritance of the Levites; and what the boundaries of Benjamin, Simeon, Issachar, Zebulun, and Gad were to be in verses 4-29. In addition to all this 
that chapter declares that the city was to have twelve gates named after the tribes of Israel - three gates facing north, those of Reuben, Judah, and Levi; three gates facing east, those of Joseph, 
Benjamin, and Dan; three gates facing south, those of Simeon, Issachar and Zebulun; and three gates facing west, those of Gad, Asher, and Naphtali, in verses 31-34. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 From all this it is evident 
that 'the twelve tribes' means all things that belong to the Lord's kingdom, and so all that are matters of faith and love, for these constitute the Lord's kingdom, as stated above. Because the twelve 
tribes meant all things of the Lord's kingdom they also represented that kingdom by their encampments and by their travellings. In Moses it is said that they were to encamp according to the tribes around 
the Tent of Meeting - to the east, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun; to the south, Reuben, Simeon, and Gad; to the west, Ephraim Manasseh, and Benjamin; and to the north, Dan, Asher, and Naphtali, and 
as they were encamped so they travelled, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%202:1-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 2:1-end</a>. In all this they represented the Lord's kingdom, as is quite evident from Balaam's prophecy, </p>
<blockquote>
When Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel 
dwelling according to tribes, the Spirit of God came upon him and he delivered his utterance, and said, How good your tabernacles are, O Jacob; your dwelling-places, O Israel! They are like valleys that

 From this also it is evident what the inheritances of the land of Canaan according to tribes represented, in connection 
with which it is said in Moses that he was to take a census of the congregation of the children of Israel, according to their fathers' houses; a census of those twenty or more years old, everyone 
going into the army of Israel. The land was to be distributed by lot; according to the names of their fathers' tribes they were to receive an inheritance, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2026:2,%207-56;%2033:54;%2034:19-29&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 26:2, 7-56; 33:54; 34:19-29</a>. And Joshua's 
actual division of the land by lot according to tribes is described in Chapters <a href="13.htm">13</a>, <a href="15.htm">15</a>-<a href="19.htm">19</a> of the Book of Joshua. From these particular details it is evident that the Lord's kingdom was represented, 
as has been stated; for the land of Canaan meant that kingdom, see <a href="1585.htm">1585</a>, <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>, <a href="3038.htm">3038</a>, <a href="3481.htm">3481</a>, <a href="3705.htm">3705</a>. </p>

 The reason why they are called 'armies' and why it is said that 'they encamped according to their 
armies and travelled according to their armies', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%202:4,%206,%208,%2011,%2013,%2015,%2019,%2021-23,%2026,%2028,%2030&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 2:4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 15, 19, 21-23, 26, 28, 30</a>, is that 'an army' had the same meaning [as 'a tribe'], namely truths and goods, see <a href="3448.htm">3448</a>. And the 
Lord is called Jehovah Zebaoth or 'Jehovah of Armies (or Hosts)' <a href="3448.htm">3448</a>. They were for these reasons called 'the armies of Jehovah' when they departed from Egypt, as in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
It happened at the end 
of the four hundred and thirty years, on that same day it happened that all the armies of Jehovah were to come out of the land of Egypt. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2012:41&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 12:41</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone may recognize that such people in Egypt, 
and after that in the wilderness, were not called 'the armies of Jehovah' except in a representative sense, for no good or truth was present in them, the worst of all nations. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 From this it is 
also quite evident what was meant by the names of the twelve tribes on Aaron's breastplate, which was called the Urim and Thummim. Concerning the breastplate the following is said in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
There 
shall be four rows in it and twelve stones. These stones shall be according to the names of the sons of Israel, twelve according to their names. The engravings of a signet, for each one over its name, 
there shall be for the twelve tribes. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2028:17,%2021;%2039:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 28:17, 21; 39:14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>For 'Aaron' represented the Lord's Divine priesthood, and therefore all the vestments worn by him as high priest meant Divine celestial 
and spiritual things. But the exact meaning of those vestments will in the Lord's Divine mercy be clear where they are the subject. Since the breastplate itself was most holy, the names of it were 
representations of all the essential characteristics of love and faith in the Lord. These are the Urim and Thummim. The reason why the names were engraved on the precious stones was that 'stones' in general 
meant truths, <a href="1298.htm">1298</a>, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>, and 'precious stones' truths shining through from good, <a href="114.htm">114</a>. And because the name of each individual tribe meant some essential characteristic, a specific stone was also 
allocated for each tribe, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2028:17-20;%2039:10-13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 28:17-20; 39:10-13</a>, which expressed by means of its colour and transparence the characteristic meant by that tribe. This was how Jehovah or the Lord gave answers by 
means of the Urim and Thummim. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[10]</b>
 The two shoham stones which were on the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod had a similar representation but in a lesser degree than the twelve stones on the breastplate. 
For 'the shoulders' meant all power, and so the Lord's omnipotence, <a href="1085.htm">1085</a>, whereas 'the breast' or heart and lungs meant Divine celestial and spiritual love - 'the heart' Divine celestial love, 
'the lungs' Divine spiritual love, see <a href="3635.htm">3635</a> and the end of the present chapter where the Grand Man and its correspondence with the province of the heart and the province of the lungs is the subject. The 
two stones on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod are referred to in Moses as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
You shall take two shoham stones and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel, six of the names on one 
stone and the remaining six names on the other stone, according to their births. You shall put two stones on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, stones of remembrance for the sons of Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2028:9-12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 28:9-12</a>; 
39:6, <a href="7.htm">7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[11]</b>
 Because 'the tribes' meant what are essentially matters of truth and good, or faith and love, and each tribe meant some universal aspect of these, and since the tribe of Levi meant 
love, as will be evident from the explanation at verse 34 below, one can therefore recognize what was meant by their placing rods, one for each tribe, in the Tent of Meeting and by Levi's rod alone 
blossoming with almonds. All this is described in Moses as follows, </p>
<p>He was told to take twelve rods, one rod for each head of their fathers' houses, and these were to be left in the Tent of Meeting, 
the name of Aaron being written on the rod of Levi. Aaron's rod was placed in the middle of them. And the next day, behold, Aaron's rod for the tribe of Levi had blossomed; it had produced buds,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> so 
that it flowered and produced almonds. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2017:2-8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 17:2-8</a>. </p>
<p>These occurrences meant that love was the essential, also the first and foremost, thing of all in the Lord's kingdom and that love is the source 
of all fruitfulness. And the reason why Aaron's name was on the rod was that Aaron represented the Lord as regards His Divine priesthood. For by the Lord's priesthood is meant Divine Good, which essentially 
is His love and mercy, and by the Lord's kingship is meant Divine Truth which stems from Divine Good, see <a href="1728.htm">1728</a>, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a> (end), <a href="3670.htm">3670</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[12]</b>
 From what has been introduced so far one may now see what 
'tribes' and 'the twelve tribes' mean in the following places: In John, </p>
<p>I heard the number of the sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand sealed out of every tribe of Israel - twelve thousand 
sealed out of the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand sealed out of the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand sealed out of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand sealed out of the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand 
sealed out of the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand sealed out of the tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousand sealed out of the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand sealed out of the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand 
sealed out of the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand sealed out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand sealed out of the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand sealed out of the tribe of Benjamin. Rev. 
7:4-8. </p>
<p>In Moses, </p>
<p>Remember the days of old, understand the years of generation after generation. </p>
<blockquote>
When the Most High gave to the nations an inheritance, when He separated the sons of man, He 
fixed the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the sons of Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2032:7,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 32:7, 8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Jerusalem, built as a city which is closely compacted together, to which the tribes 
go up, the tribes of Jah, a testimony to Israel, to confess the name of Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20122:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 122:3, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[13]</b>
 In Joshua, who was told, </p>
<blockquote>
The Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of all the earth is going to pass 
over before you into the Jordan. Take twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man from each tribe. And it will happen when the soles of the feet of the priests bearing the Ark of Jehovah, the Lord 
of all the earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan will be cut off. They will stand in one heap. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%203:%2011-17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 3: 11-17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And further, </p>
<p>Take out of the midst of the Jordan, 
from the places where the priests' feet stood, twelve stones which you are to prepare and carry with you. And let each man take a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of Israel, 
that it may be a sign that the waters of the Jordan were cut off. Moreover Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, beneath the places where the feet of the priests bearing the Ark of 
the Covenant had stood. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%204:%201-9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 4: 1-9</a>. </p>
<p>Also in the description about Elijah, </p>
<p>Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word had come, Israel 
shall be your name; and he built an altar to the name of Jehovah. <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 18:31, <a href="32.htm">32</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[14]</b>
 That 'the tribes' means the goods of love and the truths of faith is also clear from the Lord's words 
in Matthew, </p>
<p>Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and glory. Matt. 
24:30. </p>
<p>Here 'all the tribes of the earth will mourn' means that the acknowledgement of truth and the life of good will not exist any longer, for the subject in that chapter is the close of the age. 
Similarly in John, </p>
<p>Behold, He is coming with clouds, and every eye will see Him, and those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the earth will wail over Him. Rev. 1:7. </p>
<p>What 'coming in the clouds 
of heaven' means, see Preface to Gen. <a href="18.htm">18</a>. See in addition what I have been shown from experience about the number 'twelve', in <a href="2129.htm">2129</a>, <a href="2130.htm">2130</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[15]</b>
 The reason why all things of faith and love are 
called 'tribes' is that the same expression in the original language also means a sceptre and a rod. For 'a sceptre' and also 'a rod' mean power, as will in the Lord's Divine mercy be shown elsewhere. 
For this reason the noun 'tribe' entails the idea that forms of good and truth possess within them all power from the Lord. And angels too are therefore referred to as 'powers' and also 'principalities', 
for 'princes' means the first and foremost aspects of charity and faith, such as the twelve princes descended from Ishmael, Gen. 25:16, see <a href="2089.htm">2089</a>, as well as the princes who were leaders of the tribes, 
Num. 7:1-end; 13:4-16. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[16]</b>
 From what has been said up to now about the twelve tribes one can recognize why the Lord's disciples, who later on were called apostles, were twelve in number, and 
that like the tribes they represented the Lord's Church as regards goods and truths, <a href="2129.htm">2129</a>, <a href="3354.htm">3354</a>, <a href="3488.htm">3488</a>, <a href="3857.htm">3857</a>. 'Peter' represented faith, 'dames' charily, and 'John' the works that flow from charity, see 
the Prefaces to Gen. <a href="18.htm">18</a> and <a href="22.htm">22</a>, and also <a href="3750.htm">3750</a>. This is also quite evident from the things which the Lord said about them and to them.

Quia in nunc sequentibus agitur de duodecim filiis Jacobi, et ex illis ut patribus duodecim tribus Israelis nominatae sunt, in antecessum hic dicendum quid `tribus' significant, et cur duodecim fuerint; 
nemo adhuc novit arcanum quod in his latet, quia historica Verbi crediderunt nude historica esse, et non in illis plus Divini {1}, quam quod servire potuerint ad applicationes cum de rebus sanctis 
agitur; inde etiam crediderunt quod duodecim tribus nihil aliud significaverint quam partitiones populi Israelitici in tot distinctas gentes seu familias communes, cum tamen Divina involvant, 
nempe tot partitiones universales fidei et amoris, proinde quae regni Domini in caelis et in terris sunt, et {2}quidem unaquaevis tribus aliquod universale; quid autem unaquaevis {3}significat, 
ex mox sequentibus patebit ubi de filiis Jacobi a quibus tribus illae nominatae sunt, agitur; in genere `{5}duodecim tribus' significarunt omnia doctrinae veri et boni, seu fidei et amoris, haec enim, 
nempe verum et bonum, seu fides et amor, faciunt regnum Domini, nam illa quae sunt veri seu fidei, sunt omne cogitationis ibi, et illa quae sunt boni seu amoris, sunt omne affectionis; et quia 
Ecclesia Judaica fuit instituta ut repraesentaret regnum Domini, ideo {5}partitiones populi illius in duodecim tribus illa {6}significabant: hoc est arcanum quod prius non detectum fuit; [2]quod `duodecim' 
significent omnia in genere, prius n. 577, 2089, 2129, 2130 f., 3272 ostensum est; quod autem `tribus' significent illa quae sunt veri et boni, seu fidei et amoris, ita `duodecim tribus' omnia 
illorum, licet hic antequam de singulis in specie agitur, ex Verbo confirmare; apud Johannem,            Civitas sancta Hierosolyma nova habens portas duodecim et      super portis angelos duodecim, 
et nomina scripta quae sunt      duodecim tribuum filiorum Israelis; munus civitatis habebat      fundamenta duodecim, et in iis nomina duodecim apostolorum      Agni. . . . Mensus est civitatem 
calamo in stadiis duodecies      mille, . . . et mensus est murum ejus centum quadraginta      quatuor cubitorum, quae est mensura hominis, hoc est, angeli,      duodecim portae duodecim margaritae, 
Apoc. xxi 12, 14, 16, 17,      21; </p>
<p>quod `civitas sancta,' seu Nova Hierosolyma, sit nova Ecclesia Domini, patet a singulis quae ibi; in illis quae praecedunt, agitur de statu Ecclesiae qualis 
ante finem ejus futurus, hic de nova Ecclesia; et quia ita, sunt `portae, murus, fundamenta' non aliud quam quae sunt Ecclesiae, quae sunt illa quae charitatis et fidei, haec enim Ecclesiam faciunt;[3]inde 
unicuivis constare potest quod per `duodecim' toties ibi nominata, tum per `tribus,' ut et per `apostolos,' non duodecim, nec tribus, nec apostoli intelligantur, sed quod per `duodecim' 
omnia in uno complexu, ut ostensum videatur n. 577, 2089, 2129, 2130 f., 3272; similiter per numerum centum quadraginta quatuor, hic enim est duodecies duodecim; et quia per duodecim significantur 
omnia, inde patet quod per `duodecim tribus' significentur omnia quae sunt Ecclesiae, quae quod sint verum et bonum, seu fides et amor, {7}supra dictum est; similiter per `duodecim apostolos,' per 
quos quoque quod omnia Ecclesiae, hoc est, omnia fidei et amoris repraesentata sint, videatur n. 2129, 3354, 3488, 3857; inde nunc dicitur numerus ille `mensura hominis, hoc est, angeli,' per quod 
intelligitur status veri et boni; quod `mensura' sit status, videatur n. 3104; quod `homo' sit id quod Ecclesiae, patet ab illis quae de significatione hominis, n. 478, 479, 565, 768, I871, 1894 dicta 
sunt, et quoque ex eo quod regnum Domini dicatur Maximus Homo, et hoc ex bono et vero, quae a Domino, de quo ad finem capitum n. 3624-3649, 3741-3750; quod `angelus' sit idem, n. 1705, 1754, 1925, 
2821, 3039. [4]Similiter {8}ut apud Johannem, etiam apud Prophetas in Veteri Testamento agitur de nova Hierosolyma, et per illam similiter significatur nova Ecclesia Domini, ut apud Esaiam lxv 
18, 19, seq: apud Zachariam xiv; </p>
<p>imprimis apud Ezechielem xl-xlviii, ubi per novam Hierosolymam, per novem Templum, et per novam terram describitur in sensu interno regnum Domini in caelis, et regnum 
Domini in terris, quod est Ecclesia; ex illis ibi constare potest manifestius quam alibi quid per `terram,' per `Hierosolymam,' per Templum, et per omnia quae ibi significata sunt, et quoque quid 
per `duodecim tribus,' nam de divisione terra' et `hereditate ejus secundum tribus' agitur, et quoque de `civitate, et ejus muris, fundamento, portis,' et de omnibus quae `Templi' ibi erunt, a quibus 
solum illa quae de tribubus dicuntur {9}, hic afferre licet,           Dixit Dominus Jehovih, Hic est terminus ad quem      hereditabitis terram, juxta duodecim tribus Israelis: . . .

<p>et de portis civitatis 
juxta nomina tribuum Israelis, ibid. vers. 31-34; [5]quod per tribus ibi non (t)tribus intellectae sint, evidenter patet, decem enim tribus jamdum tunc fuerunt per universum terrarum orbem {10}dispersae, 
et postea nec redierunt, nec usquam redire possunt, nam gentes factae sunt, et tamen singulae nominantur quomodo hereditaturae terram, et qui termini cuivis, quis nempe terminus tribui Danis,

Gadis, ibid. vers. 4-29; tum quoque quod ibi duodecim portae juxta nomina tribuum Israelis, quod portae tres versus septentrionem, Reubenis, Jehudae, Levi; portae tres versus orientem, Josephi, Benjaminis, 
Danis; </p>
<p>portae tres versus meridiem, Shimeonis, Jisascharis, Zebulonis; </p>
<p>portae tres versus occidentem, Gadis, Asheris, Naphtali, ibid. vers. 31-34;  [6]inde patet quod per `duodecim tribus' significentur 
omnia illa quae sunt regni Domini, proinde quod sint omnia fidei et amoris, quia haec faciunt regnum Domini, ut supra dictum. Quia duodecim tribus omnia regni Domini significabant, etiam 
duodecim tribus per `castrametationes' et quoque per `profectiones' illud repraesentabant, de quibus apud Mosen           Quod castrametarentur juxta tribus circum Tentorium      conventus,

quod repraesentatum sit regnum Domini, ut dictum, a singulis patet, terra enim Canaan illud significavit, videatur n. 1585, 1607, 3038, 3481, 3705: [8]{14}quod vocentur `exercitus,' et dicatur quod 
`secundum exercitus castrametarentur, et secundum exercitus proficiscerentur,' Num. ii 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 15, 19, 21, (22), 23, 26, 28, 30, est quia `exercitus' idem significabat, nempe vera et bona, 
videatur n. 3448; et `Dominus' Jehovah Zebaoth seu Jehovah Exercituum, n. 3448; `exercitus Jehovae' inde appellati sunt eum exierunt {16}Aegypto, ut apud Mosen,           Factum a fine triginta 
annorum et quadringentorum      annorum, factum est in ipso die hoc exirent omnes exercitus      Jehovae e terra Aegypti, Exod. xii 41; </p>
<p>quisque scire potest quod qui {17}tales fuerunt in Aegypto, 
et dein tales in deserto, non appellati sint `exercitus Jehovae' quam repraesentative in nullo enim bono nec vero fuerunt, pessima gens inter omnes. [9]Inde quoque manifeste patet quid per nomina duodecim 
tribuum in pectorali Aharonis, quod Urim et Thummim dictum, significatum sit, de quo ita apud Mosen,           Erunt ibi quatuor ordines, duodecim lapides, lapides hi      erunt juxta nomina 
filiorum Israelis, duodecim juxta nomina      eorum; sculpturae sigilli cuivis supra nomen ejus erunt pro      duodecim tribubus, Exod. xxviii (17), 21; xxxix 14; </p>
<p>`Aharon' enim repraesentabat 
Divinum sacerdotium Domini, quare etiam omnia illa quibus indutus fuit, Divina caelestia et spiritualia significabant, {18}at quae significaverint, {19}ex Divina Domini Misericordia, constabit ubi 
de illis agendum; {20}in ipso pectorali quia sanctissimum fuit, repraesentationes erant omnium quae amoris et fidei in Dominum sunt; haec sunt Urim et Thummim; quod lapidibus pretiosis insculpta essent 
nomina, erat quia `lapides' in genere significant vera, n. 1298, 3720; `lapides pretiosi' vera quae pellucent a bono, n. 114; et quia singularum tribuum nomina significabant quale, idcirco etiam 
designabatur lapis specialis pro unaquavis tribu, Exod. xxviii 17-20; xxxix (x)10-13, qui lapis per colorem et pellucidum suum exprimebat quale quod significabatur per unamquamvis tribum; inde erat 
quod Jehovah seu Dominus per Urim et Thummim responsa dederit. [10]Per binos lapides {21}Shoham, qui super binis humeris ephodi, simile etiam repraesentabatur, sed in minore gradu quam per duodecim 
super pectorali; `humeri' enim significabant omnem potentiam, ita omnipotentiam Domini, n. 1085; `pectus' autem, seu `cor et pulmones,' {22}amorem Divinum caelestem et spiritualem, `cor' amorem 
Divinum caelestem `pulmones' amorem Divinum spiritualem, videatur n. 3635, et ad finem hujus capitis ubi de Maximo Homine et de correspondentia ejus cum provincia cordis et cum provincia pulmonum 
agitur; de binis lapidibus super humeris ephodi ita apud Mosen,           Sumes duos lapides shoham, et sculpes super illis nomina      filiorum Israelis, sex de nominibus super lapide uno, et  
    nomina sex reliqua super lapide altero, juxta generationes      eorum; . . . pones duos lapides super humeris ephodi, lapides      recordationes filiorum Israelis, Exod. xxviii 9-11, (12); </p>
<p>    
 xxxix 6, 7. [11]{23}Quia `tribus' significabant illa quae sunt veri et boni, seu quae sunt fidei et amoris, et (x)unaquaevis tribus universale quoddam eorum, et `tribus Levi' amorem, ut patebit ab 
explicatione ad vers. 34 hujus capitis, inde sciri potest quid significabatur per quod baculos, unum pro unaquavis tribu, ponerent in Tentorio conventus, et quod solum baculus Levi floruerit amygdalis, 
de quibus ita apud Mosen,           Acciperet duodecim baculos, anum baculum pro capite domus      patrum eorum, . . . et relinquerentur in Tentorio conventus,      et nomen Aharonis scriberet 
super baculo Levi,. . . baculus      Aharonis ponebatur in medio eorum: . . . postridie ecce      effloruit baculus Aharonis pro tribu Levi, produxit florem, ut      floreret flos, et ferret amygdala, 
Num. xvii 17-23; </p>
<p>significabatur quod amor omnium essentiale et principale esset in regno Domini, et quod inde omnis fructificatio; et quod Aharonis nomen super illo esset, erat quia Aharon repraesentabat 
Dominum quoad Divinum sacerdotium Ipsius; quod per sacerdotium Domini significetur Divinum Bonum, quod est amoris et (x)misericordiae Ipsius, et per regium Domini, Divinum Verum quod 
ex Divino Bono, videatur n. 1728, 2015 f., 3670. [12]Ex his nunc quae allata sunt, constare potest quid per `tribus,' et per `duodecim tribus,' in sequentibus locis significatur; ut apud Johannem,  
         Audivi numerum obsignatorum, centum quadraginta quatuor      millia obsignati ex omni tribu Israelis, ex tribu Jehudae      duodecim millia obsignati; ex tribu Reubenis duodecim millia  
    obsignati ex tribu Gad duodecim millia obsignati; ex tribu      Asher duodecim millia obsignati; ex tribu Naphtalim duodecim      millia obsignati; ex tribu Menasheh duodecim millia obsignati; </p>
<p> 
    ex tribu Shimeonis duodecim millia obsignati; ex tribu Levi      duodecim millia obsignati; ex tribu Jisaschar duodecim millia      obsignati; ex tribu Zebulon duodecim millia obsignati; ex   
   tribu Joseph duodecim millia obsignati; ex tribu Benjamin      duodecim millia obsignati, Apoc. vii 4-8: </p>
<p>apud Mosen,           Memento dierum aeternitatis, intelligite annos      generationis et 
generationis, . . . cum hereditatem daret      Altissimus gentibus, cum separaret filios hominis, constituit      terminos populorum, secundum numerum filiorum Israelis, Deut.      xxxii 7, 8: </p>
<p>apud 
Davidem,           Hierosolyma aedificata sicut civitas quae cohaeret sibi      una, eo ascendunt tribus, tribus Jah, testimonium Israeli, ad      confitendum nomini Jehovae, Ps. cxxii 3, 4: </p>
<p>[13]apud 
Joshuam,           Cum transiret arca foederis Domini totius terrae coram      vobis in Jordanem, sumeret duodecim viros de tribubus,      Israelis, virum unum de tribu; fiet quando quieverint 
plantae      pedum sacerdotum portantium arcam Jehovae Domini totius terrae      in aquis Jordanis, aquae Jordanis exscindentur, . . .      consistent cumulo uno, iii 11-177 porro           Tollite 
e medio Jordanis, de statione pedum sacerdotum,      praeparando duodecim lapides, quos transferetis vobiscum,         . . . et vir lapidem unum super humero suo, juxta numerum      tribuum 
Israelis, ut sit in signum, . . . quod excisae sint      aquae Jordanis. . . . Insuper duodecim lapides erexit Joshua      in medio Jordanis, sub statione pedum sacerdotum portantium      arcam foederis, 
iv 1-9: </p>
<p>tum, quod           Elias sumpserit duodecim lapides, juxta numerum tribuum      filiorum Jacobi, ad quem factum est verbum, Israel erit nomen      tuum, ac struxerit altare in nomen 
Jehovae, 1 Reg. xviii 31,      32. [14](m)Quod `tribus' sint bona amoris et vera fidei, etiam constat ex Domini verbis apud Matthaeum,           Tunc apparebit signum Filii hominis, et tunc plangent  
    omnes tribus terrae, et videbunt Filium hominis venientem in      nubibus caeli cum virtute et gloria, xxiv 30; </p>
<p>ubi per quod `plangent omnes tribus terrae significatur quod nulla amplius 
agnitio veri et vita boni, agitur enim ibi de consummatione saeculi: similiter apud Johannem,           Ecce venit cum nubibus, et videbit Ipsum omnis oculus, et      qui Ipsum perfoderunt, et lugebunt 
super Ipso omnes tribus      terrae, Apoc. i 7; </p>
<p>quid sit `venite in nubibus caeli,' videatur Praefatio ad cap. xviii Gen.(n)  Praeterea videantur quae per experientiam de `duodecim' mihi ostensa 
sunt, de qua n. 2129, 2130. [15]Quod omnia fidei et amoris dicta sint `tribus,' est inde (x)quia eadem vox in lingua originali etiam significat sceptrum et baculum; quod `sceptrum' ut et `baculus' 
sit potentia, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, alibi ostendetur; exinde involvit nomen tribus id quod bonis et veris insit omnis potentia a Domino; {24}ideo quoque angeli `potentiae' nominati sunt, 
et quoque `principatus,' nam principes significat primaria charitatis et fidei, ut duodecim principes qui ab Ishmaele, Gen. xxv 16, videatur {25}2089, tum principes qui tribubus praeerant, Num. 
 vii 1 ad f., xii 4-16.  [16](m)Ex his, quae hactenus de duodecim tribubus dicta sunt, sciri potest cur discipuli Domini, qui postea vocati sunt apostoli, numero duodecim fuerint, et quod illi repraesentaverint 
Ecclesiam Domini quoad bona et vera similiter ac tribus, n. (x)2129, 3354, 3488, (x)3857; quod `Petrus' repraesentaverit fidem, `Jacobus' charitatem, et `Johannes' opera charitatis, 
videatur Praefatio ad cap. xviii, et Praef. ad cap. xxii Gen.; tum n. 3750; quod etiam manifeste patet ab iis quae Dominus de illis et cum illis {26}locutus est.(n) @1 i inesse$ @2 sic$ @3 significet$ @4
