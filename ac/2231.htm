<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2231节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2231.</strong>“为要叫他吩咐他的众子和随从他的家属遵守耶和华的道，秉公行义”表仁与信的全部教义皆来自祂。这从“众子”、“家属”、“道”、“公义”、“公平”的含义清楚可知，这几个词的含义综括起来，或合在一起，就表示仁与信的全部教义。因为“众子”表处于真理的所有人，“家属”表处于良善的所有人，“道”表他们被教导的信之教义，“义”表涉及良善的教义，而“公”表涉及真理的教义。涉及良善的教义是仁之教义，而涉及真理的教义是信之教义。<br />一般来说，教义只有一种，也就是说，只有仁爱的教义。因为如前所述（<a href="2228.htm">2228</a>节），信的一切事物皆关注仁爱。仁与信之别无非是意愿善事和思想善事之别（凡意愿善事者也思想善事），因而无非是意愿与理解力之别。人若深思这个问题，就会知道，意愿是一回事，理解力是另一回事。这一点在学术界也是众所周知的，并且从那些意愿恶事，却出于思维谈论善事之人身上明显看出来。谁都能通过这种人清楚看出，意愿是一回事，理解力是另一回事，因而人类心智被分裂为两个部分，此时，这两个部分没有合为一体。然而，人是以这种方式被造的，即：这两个部分要构成一个心智，并且它们之间不应有其它区别，打个比方说，意愿与理解力的区别只不过是火和火所发之光的区别。对主之爱和对邻之仁就像火，一切感知和思维就像这火所发之光。因此，爱与仁构成感知与思维的全部，也就是说，存在于它们的每一个部分中。被称为信的，就是有关爱与仁的本质的感知或思维。<br />但由于人类开始意愿恶事、仇恨邻舍，并且实施报复和残忍行为，以致被称为意愿的心智部分彻底败坏，所以人们开始区别仁与信，并将属于其宗教的所有教义都归于信，还冠之以“信”。最终，他们走得越来越远，以至于声称，人们仅凭信（他们所说的信是指其教义）就能得救。他们还声称，不管他们过什么样的生活，只要信这些教义就能得救。仁由此与信分离，当出现这种情形时，打个比方说，这信无非是一种没有火的光，就像冬天里的光，这光如此冰冷，以至于地上的植被都枯萎凋亡。而源于仁的信就像春夏之光，这光使万物发芽开花。<br />这一点也可从以下事实得知，即：爱与仁是属天之火，而信是这火所发的属灵之光。它们以这种方式在来世变得能感知并可见。因为在来世，主的属天之物在天使面前显为如同那太阳所发出的火光，而主的属灵之物则显为这光辉所发的光亮。这光辉和光亮照着天使和灵人所具有的爱与仁的生活从内在作用于他们。这就是来世的喜乐和幸福及其一切变化的源头。所有这一切表明唯信得救的断言是怎么一回事。</p>

Because he will command his sons, and his house after him, and they will keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and judgment. That this signifies that all the doctrine of charity and faith is from 
Him, is evident from the signification of a "son," of a "house," of a "way," of righteousness," and of "judgment;" which when summed up, or gathered into one sense, signify all the doctrine of charity 
and faith. For by "sons" are signified all who are in truths, by "house" all who are in goods, by a "way" the doctrine by which they are instructed, which doctrine in regard to good is signified 
by "righteousness," and in regard to truth by "judgment." Doctrine concerning good is the doctrine of charity, and doctrine concerning truth is the doctrine of faith. [2] In general, there is only one 
doctrine, namely, the doctrine of charity, for (as before said, n. 2228) all things of faith look to charity. Between charity and faith there is no other difference than that between willing what is 
good and thinking what is good (for he who wills what is good also thinks what is good), thus than that between the will and the understanding. They who reflect, know that the will is one thing and the 
understanding another. This is also known in the learned world, and it plainly appears with those who will evil and yet from thought speak well; from all which it is evident to everyone that the will 
is one thing, and the understanding another; and thus that the human mind is distinguished into two parts, which do not make a one. Yet man was so created that these two parts should constitute one 
mind; nor should there be any other distinction (to speak by comparison) than such as there is between a flame and the light from it (love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor being like the flame, 
and all perception and thought being like the light from it); thus love and charity should be the all of the perception and thought, that is should be in each and all things of them. Perception 
or thought concerning the quality of love and charity is that which is called faith. [3] But as the human race began to will what is evil, to hate the neighbor, and to exercise revenges and cruelties, 
insomuch that that part of the mind which is called the will was altogether destroyed, men began to make a distinction between charity and faith, and to refer to faith all the doctrinal matters that 
were of their religion, and call them by the single term faith; and at length they went so far as to say that they could be saved by faith alone-by which they meant their doctrinal things-provided they 
merely believed these, no matter how they might live. Thus was charity separated from faith, which is then nothing else whatever (to speak by comparison) than a kind of light without flame, such as 
is wont to be the light of the sun in time of winter, which is cold and icy, insomuch that the vegetation of the earth grows torpid and dies; whereas faith from charity is like the light in the time 
of spring and summer, by which all things germinate and bloom. [4] This may also be known from the fact that love and charity are celestial flame, and that faith is the spiritual light therefrom. In 
this manner also do they present themselves to perception and sight in the other life; for there the Lord's celestial manifests itself before the angels by a flaming radiance like that of the sun, and 
the Lord's spiritual by the light from this radiance, by which also angels and spirits are affected as to their interiors, in accordance with the life of love and charity that appertains to them. This 
is the source in the other life of joys and happinesses with all their varieties. And all this shows how the case is with the statement that faith alone saves. </p>

'That he will command his sons, and his house after him, and they will keep the way of Jehovah to do righteousness and judgement' means that from Him comes the entire doctrine of charity and of faith. 
This becomes clear from the meaning of 'son', 'house', 'way', 'righteousness', and 'judgement', which in short, or when their several meanings are converted into one, mean the entire doctrine of charity 
and of faith. For 'sons' means all who are governed by truths, 'house' all who are governed by goods, 'way' means the doctrine of faith which they are taught, 'righteousness' that doctrine in regard 
to good, 'judgement', in regard to truth. Doctrine regarding good is the doctrine of charity, while doctrine regarding truth is the doctrine of faith. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In general there is only one doctrine, 
that is to say, the doctrine of charity, for, as stated in <a href="2228.htm">2228</a>, all things of faith have charity in view. No other difference exists between charity and faith than that which exists between willing 
what is good and thinking what is good - for one who wills what is good also thinks what is good - thus than that which exists between will and understanding. People who reflect on the matter know that 
the will is one thing and the understanding another. The same is also well recognized in the learned world, and it is plain to see in the case of those who will what is evil and yet from thought utter 
what is good. From such persons it is evident to anyone that the will is one thing and the understanding another, and thus that the human mind is divided into two parts which do not then make a single 
whole. Yet man was created in such a way that those two parts should constitute one single mind, and no other difference should exist between them than, to use a comparison, between that of a flame 
and the light shining from it. Love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour were to be like the flame, and all perception and thought like the light shining from it. Thus love and charity were 
to constitute the whole of perception and thought, that is, to exist in every single part. Perception or thought regarding the essential nature of love and charity is that which is called faith. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
But because the human race started to will what was evil, to hate the neighbour, and to practice revenge and cruelty, with the result that the part of the mind called the will was completely corrupted, 
men started to make a distinction between charity and faith, and to attribute to faith all those matters of doctrine which belonged to their religion and to refer to them by the single term faith. 
At length they went so far as to say that people could be saved by faith alone, by which they meant their doctrine. They said that provided they believed that doctrine people could be saved no matter 
how they lived. Charity was accordingly separated from faith, and when that happens it is nothing else, to use a comparison, than some kind of light that has no flame, like sunlight in winter-time which 
is so cold and icy that the earth's vegetation languishes and dies. But faith that is derived from charity is like the light of spring-time and summer-time which causes all things to sprout and come 
into flower. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The same may also be recognized from the fact that love and charity are celestial flame, while faith is the spiritual light that shines from it. This is also how faith and charity 
make a perceptible and visual presentation of themselves in the next life, for in that life the Lord's celestial manifests itself before the angels by means of a flaming radiance like that of the 
sun, while the Lord's spiritual manifests itself by means of the light shining from this; and that radiance and light act upon the angels and spirits interiorly according to the life of love and charity 
existing with them. This is the source of the joy and happiness in the next life with all their variations. These considerations show the implications of the assertion that faith alone saves. </p>

`Propterea quod praecipiet filiis suis, et domui suae post se, et custodient viam Jehovae ad faciendum justitiam et judicium': quod significet quod ab Ipso omnis doctrina charitatis et fidei, constare 
potest a significatione `filii, domus, viae, justitiae, et judicii' quae in summam seu in unum sensum redacta significant omnem doctrinam charitatis et fidei; per `filios' enim significantur omnes 
qui sunt in veris, per `domum' omnes qui in bonis, per `viam' doctrina' qua instruuntur, quae doctrina de bono significatur per `justitiam,' et de vero per `judicium'; doctrina de bono est doctrina charitatis 
et doctrina de vero est doctrina fidei: [2] in genere est modo una doctrina, nempe doctrina charitatis, nam charitatem, ut dictum n. 2228, spectant omnia fidei; inter charitatem et fidem non 
alia intercedit differentia quam quae est inter velle bonum et cogitare bonum; qui vult bonum, is quoque cogitat bonum; ita quae est inter voluntatem et intellectum; qui reflectunt, sciunt quod aliud 
sit voluntas et aliud intellectus; in orbe erudito hoc etiam {3} notum est, et apparet manifeste {4} apud (c)eos qui volunt male et tamen ex cogitatione loquuntur bene; ex quibus cuivis patet quod aliud 
sit voluntas et aliud intellectus, et sic quod mens humana sit in binas partes distincta quae non unum faciunt; homo tamen ita creatus est, quod illae binae partes unam mentem constituerent, nec alia 
distinctio esset quam ut comparative {5} dicatur, qualis est inter flammam et lucem inde; amor in Dominum et charitas erga proximum foret sicut flamma, et omnis perceptio et cogitatio foret sicut lux 
inde, ita quod amor et charitas foret omne perceptionis et cogitationis, hoc est, in omnibus et singulis ejus; perceptio aut {6} cogitatio de qualitate amoris et charitatis est quod vocatur fides: 
[3] sed quia genus humanum coepit malum velle, odio habere proximum, et exercere vindictas et crudelitates, usque adeo ut illa pars mentis quae voluntas dicitur, prorsus deperdita sit, (m)(t)coeperunt 
distinguere' inter charitatem (c)et fidem, et ad fidem referre omnia doctrinalia, quae religionis (c)illorum fuerunt, et illa una voce appellare fidem, et tandem eo usque processerunt ut dicerent quod 
salvari possent per solam fidem, per quam intellexerunt doctrinalia sua, si modo illa crederent, utcumque viverent; ita separata est charitas a fide, quae tunc usque non aliud est, (n)ut comparative 
dicatur, quam lux quaedam absque flamma, qualis solet esse lux solis tempore hiemis, quae frigida et gelida (o)est in tantum ut vegetata telluris torpescant et emoriantur; cum tamen fides ex charitate 
est sicut lux tempore veris et aestatis, per quam omnia germinant et florent: [4] hoc sciri potest (o)etiam ex eo quod amor et charitas sit flamma caelestis et quod fides sit lux spiritualis inde; similiter 
etiam {7} se sistunt percipienda et videnda in altera vita, nam ibi caeleste Domini se manifestat coram angelis per flammeum jubar sicut solis, et spirituale Domini per lucem inde, quibus etiam 
afficiuntur angeli et spiritus quoad interiora secundum amoris et charitatis vitam apud eos; inde gaudia et felicitates cum illos differentiis in altera vita: ex his constare potest quomodo se habet 
cum hoc quod dicitur quod sola fides salvet. 	@1 i quae salvat.$ 	@2 i quae vivit.$ 	@3 before erudito.$ 	@4 i hoc.$ 	@5 comparativa I.$ 	@6 haec seu.$ 	@7 enim.$ </p>
