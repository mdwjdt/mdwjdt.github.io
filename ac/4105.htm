<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4105节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4105.</strong>“又带走他一切的产业，所积蓄的一切财物”表从拉班所属之物那里获得的真理与良善的分离。这从“带走”、“产业”和“财物”的的含义清楚可知：“带走”是指分离；“产业”（acquisition）是指真理；“财物”（substance）是指良善。“所积蓄的”涉及用来获得它们的拉班及其羊群。之所以“产业”表示真理，“财物”表示良善，是因为在原文，“产业”是一个还表示一般的小牲畜的词，而当“羊群”表示良善时，“牲畜”尤表真理。在这种情况下，“财物”就表示所有这些真理与良善从中被获取的资源。因为当几乎意思一样的这两样事物在圣言中被提及时，一个论及真理，另一个论及良善，因为真理与良善的天上婚姻就存在于圣言的每一个细节中（参看<a href="683.htm">683</a>，<a href="793.htm">793</a>，<a href="801.htm">801</a>，<a href="2173.htm">2173</a>，<a href="2516.htm">2516</a>，<a href="2712.htm">2712</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4105</b></p><p><b>4105.</b>
And he carried away all his acquisition, and all his substance which he had gathered. That this signifies the separation of the truth and good derived from what was Laban's, is evident from the signification 
of "carrying away," as being to separate; from the signification of "acquisition," as being truth; and from the signification of "substance," as being good. "Which he had gathered," has regard 
to Laban and his flock, by means of which they had been procured. The reason why "acquisition" denotes truth, and "substance" good, is that in the original language "acquisition" is a word which also 
signifies cattle in general, and by "cattle" specifically are signified truths, when by "flocks" are signified goods; and by "substance" is signified the resources from which all these are procured. 
For when two things of nearly similar signification are mentioned in the Word, the one is predicated of truth, and the other of good, on account of the heavenly marriage of truth and good in every particular 
of the Word (see n. 683, 793, 801, 2173, 2516, 2712). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4105</b></p><p><b>4105.</b>
'And he brought away all his cattle and all his substance which he had gathered' means the separation of truth and good acquired from what belonged to Laban. This is clear from the meaning of 'bringing 
away' as separating; from the meaning of 'castle' as truth; and from the meaning of 'substance' as good. The phrase 'which he had gathered' has regard to Laban and his flock by means of which they 
had been acquired. The reason why 'cattle' means truth and 'substance' good is that the word used in the original language for 'acquisition' also means small cattle in general, by which truths are meant 
specifically when 'frocks' means goods. And 'substance' in this case means the resources from which those truths and goods are acquired. For when two things are mentioned in the Word which have almost 
the same meaning, the first has reference to truth but the second to good. They do so because of the heavenly marriage, which is the marriage of truth and good, present in every detail of the Word, 
see <a href="683.htm">683</a>, <a href="793.htm">793</a>, <a href="801.htm">801</a>, <a href="2173.htm">2173</a>, <a href="2516.htm">2516</a>, <a href="2712.htm">2712</a>. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 4105</b>
</p><b>4105.</b>
`Et abduxit omnem acquisitionem suam, et omnem substantiam suam quam comparavit': quod significet separationem veri et boni quae sunt a Labanis, constat a significatione `abducere' quod sit separare; 
a significatione `acquisitionis' quod sit verum; et a significatione `substantiae' quod sit bonum; `quam comparavit' spectat Labanem et ejus gregem, per quem illa. Quod `acquisitio' sit verum, 
et `substantia' sit bonum, est quia acquisitio in lingua originali est vox quae quoque significat pecora in communi, per quae in specie vera significantur cum per `greges' bona; et per `substantiam' 
facultates ex quibus illa; cum enim in Verbo bina similis paene significationis dicuntur, tunc unum praedicatur de vero, alterum autem de bono, ob conjugium caeleste quod est veri et boni, in singulis 
Verbi, videatur n. 683, 793, 801, 2173, 2516, 2712. </p>
