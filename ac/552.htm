<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第552节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>552.</strong>大量经历向我表明，天堂的所有幸福快乐唯独来自主，在此举出其中一例。我看见一些天使灵全神贯注地制作一个灯台，并装饰最精美的灯和鲜花以荣耀主。我蒙允许观察了一两个小时，看他们如何费尽心思制作，以便每一个细节优美而富有代表性。在做这件事时，他们以为是凭自己做的。但我被赋予觉察得知，他们凭自己根本无法设计出任何东西。几个钟头后，他们说，他们制作了一个非常漂亮、又有代表性的灯台以荣耀主，他们从内心深处感到快乐。但我告诉他们说，他们凭自己根本无法设计或创造任何东西，唯独主替他们这样制作。起初，他们几乎难以相信，但因为他们是天使灵，所以他们得到启示，承认说，的确如此。这同样适用于所有其它代表性事物、所有情感与思维（无论总体还是细微），以及天堂的幸福快乐。它们的点点滴滴全都源自独一的主。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]552.</strong> Many experiences have shown me that all joy and happiness in heaven come from the Lord alone. At this point, let me recount just one such experience.<br />I saw that certain angelic spirits, using the greatest possible care, were making an ornate lampstand, with its lamps and flowers, in the Lord's honor. For an hour or two I was allowed to observe how hard they worked to make absolutely everything beautiful and full of significance. They felt that the labor was their own, but I was able to sense clearly that they could invent nothing by their own power.<br />Finally, several hours later, they said they had succeeded in making a gorgeous lampstand, with all its representative art, in honor of the Lord, and at this they rejoiced from the depths of their being. I told them, however, that at no time had they designed or created anything on their own but that it was the Lord alone who had done this for them. At first they were scarcely willing to believe it, but being angelic spirits, they received enlightenment and confessed that it was so.<br />The same is true for all their other representative objects, for all their feelings and thoughts without exception, and so for heavenly joy and happiness; the least of them all come from the Lord alone. </p>

That all the joy and happiness in heaven are from the Lord alone, has been shown me by many experiences, of which the following may be related. I saw that with the utmost diligence some angelic spirits 
were fashioning a lampstand with its lamps and flowers of the richest ornamentation in honor of the Lord. For an hour or two I was permitted to witness with what great pains they labored to make everything 
about it beautiful and representative, they supposing that they were doing it of themselves. But to me it was given to perceive that of themselves they could devise nothing at all. At last after 
some hours they said that they had formed a very beautiful representative candelabrum in honor of the Lord, whereat they rejoiced from their very hearts. But I told them that of themselves they had 
devised and formed nothing at all, but the Lord alone for them. At first they would scarcely believe this, but being angelic spirits they were enlightened, and confessed that it was so. So it is with 
all other representative things, and with everything of affection and thought in both general and particular, and also with heavenly joys and felicities-the very smallest bit of them is from the Lord alone. </p>

I have been shown by means of many experiences that all joy and happiness in heaven come from the Lord alone. Let one of those experiences be recounted here. I was watching certain angelic spirits who 
were totally absorbed in making a lampstand with its lamps and flowers fashioned most decoratively to the honour of the Lord. I was allowed to observe for an hour or two how much work they put into 
it so that every single detail might be beautiful and representative. While they were doing it they thought that they were acting of themselves. But I was given to perceive quite clearly that of themselves 
they could not possibly design anything. At last after several hours they said that they had made a very beautiful representative lampstand to the honour of the Lord, which delighted them from the 
depths of their being. But I said that they had in no way designed or created anything of themselves. The Lord alone had done so on their behalf. At first they were hardly willing to believe it, but 
because they were angelic spirits, they saw the light and confessed that it was true. The same applies to all other representatives, and to affection and thought in every part, and so to heavenly joys 
and happiness. The smallest of them all derive from the Lord alone.  </p>

</p><b>552.</b>
Quod omne gaudium et felix in caelo, a solo Domino, ostensum mihi est per plures experientias, quarum hanc hic loci licet referre.  Videbam quod quidam spiritus angelici summo studio formare candelabrum 
cum suis lucernis et floribus ornatissime in honorem Domini; videre datum per unam alteramve horam quantum laborabant ut omnia et singula pulchra et repraesentativa essent, opinantes quod a semet; 
sed mihi manifeste appercipere datum quod nihil usque invenire possent a semet; tandem post aliquot horas dicebant quod formaverint pulcherrimum candelabrum repraesentativum in honorem Domini, inde 
ex intimis gavisi; sed dicebam quod nihil usquam ex semet invenerint et formaverint sed solus Dominus pro iis; primum illud vix credere volebant; sed quia spiritus angelici erant, illustrati sunt et fassi 
quod ita sit.  Similiter se habet cum repraesentativis ceteris, et cum omnibus et singulis affectionis et cogitationis, et sic cum gaudiis caelestibus et felicitatibus, quod omnium minima eorum a 
solo Domino. </p>
