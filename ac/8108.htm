<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8108节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8108.</strong>“夜间，在火柱中给他们光明”表当有一种模糊状态时，它就被来自良善的启示缓和。这从“夜间”、“火”和“给光明”的含义清楚可知：“夜间”是指一种模糊的状态（参看<a href="1712.htm">1712</a>，<a href="6000.htm">6000</a>节）；“火”是指爱之良善（<a href="934.htm">934</a>，<a href="4906.htm">4906</a>，<a href="5215.htm">5215</a>，<a href="6314.htm">6314</a>，<a href="6832.htm">6832</a>，<a href="6834.htm">6834</a>，<a href="6849.htm">6849</a>，<a href="7324.htm">7324</a>，<a href="7852.htm">7852</a>节）；“给光明”是指启示。耶和华或主之所以在日间云柱，夜间火柱中出现或领路，是因为由此可以代表天堂的状态。天堂有永不停止的状态的变动和变化；因为天使不断被完善，若没有状态的这种持续不断的变化，这种完善是不可能实现的。总的来说，这些变动和变化就像世上的周期性变化；如一年四季的循环，即春、夏、秋、冬，又是春；一天四时的循环，即早、午、晚、夜，又是早。当理解力正被主启示时，天上就是早晨和中午；不过那时，这种启示被如同云一样的真理模糊所缓和。理解力变得模糊时，那里就是晚上和夜间；不过，这种模糊被主通过如同发光的火一样的爱之良善所缓和。这些就是在旷野与以色列人同在的日间云柱和夜间火柱所代表的事。</p>

And by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light. That this signifies that when there was a state of obscurity, it was tempered by enlightenment from good, is evident from the signification of "night," 
as being a state of obscurity (see n. 1712, 6000); from the signification of "fire," as being the good of love (n. 934, 4906, 5215, 6314, 6832, 6834, 6849, 7324, 7852); and from the signification 
of "giving light," as being enlightenment. That Jehovah or the Lord appeared or went before in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night, was because thereby was represented the state 
of heaven, for in heaven there are never-ceasing variations and changes of state; for the angels are continually being perfected, which cannot possibly be done without unceasing changes of states. 
In general these variations and changes are like the changes of times in the world; namely, the changes of the times of the year; spring, summer, autumn, winter, and again spring; and the changes of the 
times of the day-morning, noon, evening, night, and again morning. When it is morning and noon in heaven, there is enlightenment of the understanding from the Lord, but this enlightenment is then tempered 
by obscurity of truth as by a cloud; and when it is evening and night there, they have obscurity of understanding, but this is tempered by the Lord by means of the good of love, as by a fire which 
gives light. These are the things which were represented by the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night with the sons of Israel in the wilderness. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8108</b></p><p><b>8108.</b>
'And by night in a pillar of fire to give them light' means that when there was a state of dimness, this was moderated by enlightenment from good. This is clear from the meaning of 'night' as a state 
of obscurity or dimness, dealt with in <a href="1712.htm">1712</a>, <a href="6000.htm">6000</a>; from the meaning of 'fire' as the good of love, dealt with in <a href="934.htm">934</a>, <a href="4906.htm">4906</a>, <a href="5215.htm">5215</a>, <a href="6314.htm">6314</a>, <a href="6832.htm">6832</a>, <a href="6834.htm">6834</a>, <a href="6849.htm">6849</a>, <a href="7324.htm">7324</a>, <a href="7852.htm">7852</a>; and from the meaning of 'giving light' 
as enlightenment. The reason why Jehovah or the Lord appeared or led the way in a pillar of cloud during the daytime and in a pillar of fire by night was that the state of heaven was represented 
thereby. In heaven variations and changes of state occur unceasingly; for angels are being perfected constantly, and without unceasing changes of states this perfecting could not possibly take place. 
In general those variations and changes are like the cyclic changes in the world - like the round of yearly seasons, which are spring, summer, autumn, winter, and spring again, and like the round of 
times of day, which are morning, midday, evening, night, and morning again. Morning and midday in heaven occurs when the understanding is being enlightened by the Lord; but in this state the light is 
moderated by a dimming of truth, as if by a cloud. And evening and night there occur when the understanding grows dim; but the Lord moderates that dimness by means of the good of love, as if by means 
of a fire giving light. These provisions by the Lord are what were represented by the pillar of cloud during the daytime, and the pillar of fire by night, present with the children of Israel in the wilderness. </p>

`Et noctu in columna ignis ad illuminandum illos': quod significet cum status obscuritatis quod temperatus per illustrationem a bono, constat (c)a significatione `noctis' quod sit status obscuritatis, 
de qua n. 1712, 6000; ex significatione `ignis' quod sit bonum amoris, de qua n. 934, 4906, 5215, 6314, 6832, 6834, 6849, 7324, 7852; et ex significatione `illuminare' quod sit illustratio.  Quod Jehovah 
seu Dominus apparuerit {1}seu praeiverit in columna nubis interdiu, et in columna ignis noctu, erat quia per illa repraesentabatur status caeli; ibi enim sunt perpetuae variationes et mutationes 
status, continuo enim perficiuntur angeli, quod absque perpetuis statuum mutationibus nullatenus fieri potest; in genere {2} variationes et mutationes illae se habent sicut vices temporum in mundo, 
nempe sicut vices temporum anni, quae sunt ver, aestas, autumnus, {3} hiems, (c)et iterum ver; (c)ac sicut vices temporum diei, quae sunt mane, meridies, vespera, nox, et iterum mane; cum ibi {4} mane
