<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2311节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2311.</strong>这就是圣言的性质，它由此与其它一切着作显着不同。这一点也可从以下事实明显看出来：即不仅所有名字都表示真实事物（如前所示，<a href="1224.htm">1224</a>，<a href="1264.htm">1264</a>，<a href="1876.htm">1876</a>，<a href="1888.htm">1888</a>节），而且所有表述都具有属灵意义，因而在天堂表示不同于它们在世上所表示的某种事物。这在预言部分和历史部分中是最始终如一的。当这些名字和表述以一种天堂的含义照着它们在整部圣言中所具有的意义被解读时，内义，也就是天使当中的圣言，就会显露出来。圣言的这两种意义的关系如同身体与灵魂的关系，字义就象身体，内义则象灵魂。正如身体凭灵魂活着，字义则凭内义活着。主的生命照着读它的这个人的情感而流入字义。这表明圣言何等神圣，尽管它在世俗的心智看来并非如此。</p>

That the Word is of such a nature, and that it is in this way distinct from all other writing, may be seen also from the fact that not only do all the names signify actual things (as shown above, n. 
1224, 1264, 1876, 1888), but all the words also have a spiritual sense; and they thus signify another thing in heaven from what they do on earth, and this most constantly, in both the prophetical and 
the historical parts. When these names and words are set forth in their heavenly sense in accordance with their constant signification in the whole Word, there comes forth an internal sense which is the 
angelic Word. This twofold sense of the Word is circumstanced as are the body and the soul; the literal sense is like the body, and the internal sense is like the soul; and as the body lives by means 
of the soul, so does the literal sense by means of the internal sense. Through the internal sense the Lord's life inflows into the literal sense, in accordance with the affection of him who is reading 
it. Hence it is evident how holy is the Word, although it does not appear so to worldly minds.            GENESIS 19 </p>
<p>     1. And the two angels came to Sodom in the evening; and Lot was sitting 
in the gate of Sodom; and Lot saw, and rose up to meet them, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.      2. And he said, Behold I pray my lords, turn aside, I pray, to the house of your 
servant, and pass the night, and wash your feet; and in the morning ye shall rise, and go on your way; and they said, Nay, for we will pass the night in the street.      3. And he urged them exceedingly; 
and they turned aside unto him, and came to his house; and he made them a feast, and baked unleavened [bread]; and they did eat.      4. Scarcely yet were they lain down when the men of the city, 
the men of Sodom, compassed the house about, from a boy even to an old man, all the people from the uttermost part.      5. And they cried unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men that came unto 
thee this night? Bring them out unto us, that we may know them.      6. And Lot went out unto them to the door and shut the door behind him.      7. And he said, I pray you, my brethren, do not 
wickedly.      8. Behold I pray I have two daughters, who have not known man; let me I pray bring them out unto you, and ye may do unto them as is good in your eyes; only unto these men do not anything; 
for therefore are they come under the shadow of my roof.      9. And they said, Come on. And they said, Is one come to sojourn, and shall he judge indeed? Now will we do worse to thee than to them. 
And they pressed upon the man, upon Lot, exceedingly; and drew near to break open the door.      10. And the men put forth their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut the door.  
    11. And the men who were at the door of the house they smote with blindness, from small even to great; and they labored to find the door.      12. And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou yet anyone 
here? Son-in-law, thy sons, and thy daughters, and whomsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of the place.      13. For we will destroy this place, because their cry is become great before Jehovah; 
and Jehovah hath sent us to destroy it.      14. And Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law that were to marry his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place, for Jehovah will destroy 
the city. And he was in the eyes of his sons-in-law as one that jested.      15. And when the dawn arose the angels pressed Lot to hasten, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters that 
are found, lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.      16. And he lingered; and the men laid hold of his hand, and of the hand of his wife, and of the hand of his two daughters, in the clemency 
of Jehovah upon him, and they led him forth, and set him without the city.      17. And it came to pass, when they were leading them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not back 
behind thee, and stay not in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.      18. And Lot said unto them, Nay I pray my lords.      19. Behold I pray thy servant hath found grace 
in thine eyes, and thou hast made thy mercy great, which thou hast done with me, to make alive my soul, and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest peradventure evil cleave to me, and I die.      20. 
Behold I pray this city is near to flee thither, and it is a little one; let me, I pray, escape thither-is it not a little one? And my soul shall live.      21. And he said unto him, Behold I have 
accepted thy face as to this word also, that I will not overthrow the city of which thou hast spoken.      22. Hasten, escape thither, for I cannot do anything until thou be come thither. Therefore he 
called the name of the city Zoar.      23. The sun was gone forth upon the earth, and Lot came to Zoar.      24. And Jehovah caused it to rain upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from 
Jehovah out of heaven.      25. And He overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and the growth of the ground.      26. And his wife looked back behind him, and 
became a pillar of salt.      27. And Abraham rose up early in the morning, unto the place where he had stood before Jehovah.      28. And he looked against the faces of Sodom and Gomorrah, and against 
all the faces of the land of the plain, and he saw and behold the smoke of the land went up, as the smoke of a furnace.      29. And it came to pass when God destroyed the cities of the plain, 
that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt.      30. And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his 
two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar; and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.      31. And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is no man in 
the earth to come unto us according to the way of all the earth.      32. Come, let us make our father drink wine, and let us lie with him, and let us quicken seed from our father.      33. And they 
made their father drink wine that night; and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose.      34. And it came to pass on the morrow, that the 
firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I, lay yesternight with my father; let us make him drink wine this night also, and go thou in and lie with him, and let us quicken seed from our father.   
   35. And they made their father drink wine that night also; and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he knew not when she lay down nor when she arose.      36. And the two daughters of Lot conceived 
by their father.      37. And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: he is the father of Moab even unto this day.      38. And the younger she also bare a son, and called his name 
Ben-ammi: he is the father of the sons of Ammon unto this day. </p>

That such is the nature of the Word and that in this way it differs from all other literature is also evident from the consideration that not only all names mean real things, as shown already in <a href="1224.htm">1224</a>, <a href="1264.htm">1264</a>, <a href="1876.htm">1876</a>, <a href="1888.htm">1888</a>, but also that all expressions possess a spiritual sense and so mean in heaven something different from what they do on earth. And this is quite invariably so in both the prophetical 
parts and in the historical sections. When these names and expressions are interpreted in a heavenly sense according to the meaning they have throughout the whole of the Word, the internal sense, which 
is the Word among angels, emerges. The relationship of these two senses of the Word is like that of the body and the soul - the literal sense being like the body, the internal sense like the soul. 
Just as the body lives by means of the soul so does the literal sense by means of the internal sense. By way of the internal sense the Lord's life flows into the letter according to the affection of 
the person reading it. This shows how holy the Word is, though it does not seem so to worldly minds. </p>

to his house. And he made a feast for them and baked unleavened bread; and they ate. <LI value='4'> Scarcely had they lain down when the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, from boy even to 
old man, all the people from furthest away. <LI value='5'> And they cried out to Lot, and said to him, Where are the men who came to you in the night? Bring them out to us and let us know them.  <LI value='6'> And Lot went 
out to them to the door (janua) and shut the door (ostium) behind him. <LI value='7'> And he said, No, my brothers, do not act wickedly. <LI value='8'> Behold now, I have two daughters, who have not known a man; let me now bring 
them out to you and you may do to them as is good in your eyes; only do nothing to those men, for they have come under the shadow of my roof. <LI value='9'> And they said, Stand back. And they said, Did not 
this one come to sojourn, and will he surely judge? Now we will do more harm to you than to them. And they pressed on the man, on Lot forcefully, and came near to break down the door (ostium). <LI value='10'> And 
the men reached out their hand and brought Lot into the house to them and shut the door. <LI value='11'> And the men who were at the door of the house they struck with blindness, both small and great; and these 
strove to find the door (janua). <LI value='12'> And the men said to Lot, Whom have you here still? Son-in-law, and your sons, and your daughters, and everyone you have in the city - bring [them] out of the place. 
 <LI value='13'> For we are destroying this place, for their cry has become great before Jehovah; and Jehovah has sent us to destroy it. <LI value='14'> And Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law who were marrying his 
daughters, and said, Rise up, go out of this place, for Jehovah is destroying the city. But he was in the eyes of his sons-in-law like one who was jesting. <LI value='15'> As dawn ascended the angels pressed Lot 
to hurry, saying, Rise up, take your wife and your two daughters found [here], lest you are consumed in the iniquity of the city. <LI value='16'> And he lingered; and the men grasped his hand, and his wife's hand, 
and his daughters' hands, because of Jehovah's compassion for him, and they led him away, and placed him outside the city. <LI value='17'> And so it was, when they were leading them away outside, that [one of the 
two] said, Escape for your life<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>; do not look back behind you, and do not halt in all the plain; escape into the mountain, lest you are consumed. <LI value='18'> And Lot said to them, Not so, my Lords. <LI value='19'> Behold 
now, your<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> servant has found grace in your eyes, and you have magnified your mercy which you have shown to me in causing my soul to live. But I shall not be able to escape into the mountain in case 
the evil clings to me and I die. <LI value='20'> Behold now, this city is near to flee to it, and it is small. Let me, I beg you, escape to it (is it not small?) and let my soul live. <LI value='21'> And he said to him, Behold, 
I have accepted you<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> as regards this matter also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken.  <LI value='22'> Make haste, escape to it, for I cannot do anything until you come to it. Therefore 
he called the name of the city Zoar. <LI value='23'> The sun had gone forth over the earth, and Lot came to Zoar. <LI value='24'> And Jehovah rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Jehovah out of heaven. <LI value='25'> 
And He overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew in the ground. <LI value='26'> And his wife looked back behind him, and she became a pillar of

of the land of the plain; and he saw, and behold the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace. <LI value='29'> And so it was, when God was destroying the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, 
and sent Lot away out of the midst of the overthrowing when He was overthrowing the cities in which Lot dwelt. <LI value='30'> And Lot went up out of Zoar and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with 
him, for he was afraid to dwell in Zoar. And he dwelt in a cave - he, and his two daughters. <LI value='31'> And the firstborn said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is no man in the land to come to 
us, according to the way of all the earth. <LI value='32'> Come, let us make our father drink wine, and let us lie with him, and let us keep seed alive by our father. <LI value='33'> And they made their father drink wine that 
night, and the firstborn came and lay with her father; and he did not know when she lay down and when she rose up. <LI value='34'> And so it was on the next day, that the firstborn said to the younger, Behold, 
I lay last night with my father; let us make him drink wine again tonight, and come, lie with him, and let us keep seed alive by our father. <LI value='35'> And they made their father drink wine that night also; 
and the younger rose up and lay with him; and he did not know when she lay down and when she rose up. <LI value='36'> And the two daughters of Lot conceived by their father. <LI value='37'> And the firstborn gave birth to a 
son and called his name Moab; he is the father of Moab even to this day. 38 And the younger also gave birth to a son and called his name Benammi; he is the father of the children of Ammon even to this 
day.

Quod Verbum tale sit, et sic distinctum ab omni alio scripto, constare potest etiam ex eo quod non solum omnia nomina significent res, ut ostensum prius n. 1224, 1264, 1876, 1888, sed etiam omnes voces 
sensum spiritualem habeant, ac ita quod aliud significent in caelo quam in terra et hoc constantissime tam in Propheticis quam in Historicis; quae nomina et quae voces cum in sensum caelestem secundum 
significationem eorum in toto Verbo constantem exponuntur, prodit sensus internus qui est Verbum angelicum: duplex hic sensus Verbi se habet instar corporis et animae; sensus litteralis est instar 
corporis, et sensus internus instar animae; et sicut corpus per animam vivit, ita sensus litteralis per internum; per hunc vita Domini influit in illum secundum affectionem illius qui legit: inde patet

<p>                            CAPUT XIX 	1.  ET venerunt duo angeli Sodomam in vespera, et Lot sedens in porta Sodomae, 
et vidit Lot, et surrexit obviam illis, et incurvavit se facies in terram. 	2.  Et dixit, Ecce quaeso Domini mei, declinate quaeso ad domum servi vestri, et pernoctate, et lavate pedes vestros, et mane 
surgatis, et eatis in viam vestram; et dixerunt, Non, quia in platea pernoctabimus. 	3.  Et urgebat eos valde, et declinaverunt ad eum, et venerunt ad domum ejus, et fecit eis convivium, et azyma 
coxit, et comederunt. 	4.  Vix adhuc cubuerunt, et viri urbis, viri Sodomae, circumdederunt domum, a puero et usque ad senem, omnis populus ab extremo. 	5.  Et clamaverunt ad Lot, et dixerunt ei, Ubi 
viri qui venerunt ad te noctu? Educ eos ad nos, et cognoscamus eos. 	6.  Et exivit ad eos Lot ad januam, et ostium clausit post se. 	7.  Et dixit, Ne quaeso, fratres mei, malefaciatis. 	8.  Ecce 
quaeso mihi duae filiae, quae non cognoverunt virum, educam quaeso eas ad vos, et faciatis eis sicut bonum in oculis vestris; tantum viris illis ne faciatis quicquam, quia propterea venerunt in umbram 
trabis meae. 	9.  Et dixerunt, Accede ultra, et dixerunt, Num unus venit ad peregrinandum, et judicabit judicando? Nunc malefaciemus tibi prae illis; et urserunt in virum, in Lot valde, et accesserunt 
ad effringendum ostium. 	10.  Et emiserunt viri manum suam, et introduxerunt Lotum ad se in domum, et ostium clauserunt. 	11.  Et viros, qui januae domus, percusserunt caecitatibus, a parvo et usque 
ad magnum, et laboraverunt ad inveniendum januam. 	12.  Et dixerunt viri ad Lotum, Adhuc quis tibi hic? generum, et filios tuos, et filias tuas, et omnem qui tibi in urbe, educ e loco. 	13.  Quia 
perdentes nos locum hunc, quia magnus factus est clamor eorum coram JEHOVAH, et misit nos JEHOVAH ad perdendum eum. 	14.  Et exivit Lot, et locutus est ad generos suos accipientes filias suas, et dixit, 
Surgite, exite e loco isto, quia perdens JEHOVAH urbem; et fuit sicut ludens in oculis generorum ejus. 	15.  Sicuti aurora ascendit, et ad festinandum adigebant angeli Lotum, dicendo, Surge, accipe 
uxorem tuam, et duas filias tuas inventas, ne forte consumaris in iniquitate urbis. 	16.  Et moratus, et apprehenderunt viri manum ejus, et manum uxoris ejus, et manum duarum filiarum ejus, in clementia 
JEHOVAH super eum, et eduxerunt eum, et statuerunt eum extra urbem. 	17.  Et fuit, cum educerent ii illos foras, et dixit, Eripe te super anima tua, ne respicias post te, et ne consistas in 
omni planitie; in montem eripe te, ne forte consumaris. 	18.  Et dixit Lot ad eos, Ne quaeso, Domini mei. 	19.  Ecce quaeso invenit servus tuus gratiam in oculis tuis, et magnam fecisti misericordiam 
tuam, quam fecisti mecum, ad vivificandum animam meam; et ego non potero eripere me in montem, ne forte adhaereat mihi malum, et moriar. 	20.  Ecce quaeso urbs haec propinqua ad fugiendum illuc, et 
ea parva, eripiam me quaeso illuc, annon parva ea? et vivat anima mea. 	21.  Et dixit ad eum, Ecce acceptavi faciem tuam, etiam quoad verbum hoc, quod non evertam urbem, de qua locutus [es.] 	22.  
Festina, eripe te illuc, quia non possum facere quicquam usque venire te illuc; propterea vocavit nomen urbis Zoar. 	23.  Sol egressus super terram, et Lot venit Zoarem. 	24.  Et JEHOVAH pluere fecit 
super Sodomam et super Amoram sulphur et ignem a cum JEHOVAH e caelo. 	25.  Et evertit urbes illas, et Omnem planitiem, et omnes habitatores urbium, et germen agri. 	26.  Et respexit uxor ejus post 
eum {1}, et facta statua salis. 	@1 A. alters post se to post eum, see n. 2454.$ 	27.  Et surrexit Abraham in matuta, ad locum quo steterat ibi coram JEHOVAH. 	28. Et prospexit contra facies Sodomae 
et Amorae, et contra Omnes facies terrae planitiei; et vidit, et ecce ascendit fumus terrae, sicut fumus fornacis. 	29.  Et fuit in perdendo DEUS urbes planitiei, et recordatus est DEUS Abraham, 
et emisit Lotum e medio eversionis, in evertendo urbes, in quibus habitavit Lot. 	30.  Et ascendit Lot e Zoar, et habitavit in monte, et duae filiae ejus cum eo, quia timuit habitare in Zoar; et habitabat 
in spelunca is, et duae filiae ejus. 	31.  Et dixit Primogenita ad minorem, Pater noster senex, et vir nullus in terra, ad veniendum ad nos, secundum viam totius terrae. 	32.  Veni, propinemus 
patri nostro vinum, et cubemus cum eo, et vivificemus de patre nostro semen. 	33.  Et Propinaverunt patri suo vinum in nocte illa, et venit primogenita et cubuit cum patre suo, et non cognovit in cubare 
ejus in surgere ejus. 	34.  Et fuit a crastino, et dixit primogenita ad minorem, Ecce cubui heri cum patre meo, propinemus ei vinum etiam nocte hac, et veni, cuba cum eo, et vivificemus de patre 
nostro semen. 	35.  Et propinaverunt etiam in nocte illa patri eorum vinum, et surrexit minor, et cubuit cum eo, et non cognovit in cubare ejus et in surgere ejus. 	36.  Et conceperunt binae filiae 
Loti de patre suo. 	37.  Et peperit primogenita filium, et vocavit nomen ejus Moab; is pater Moabi usque ad diem hunc. 	38.  Et minor etiam illa peperit filium, et vocavit nomen ejus Ben-ammi; is pater 
filiorum Ammonis usque ad diem hunc. </p>
