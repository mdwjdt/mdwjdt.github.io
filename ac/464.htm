<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>464.</strong>名为“以诺”的教会，被描述为出于揭示给上古教会、并为他们所直觉的东西而产生的教义，尽管这教义在当时没有用，但仍被保存下来，以备后世所用。这就是“以诺不在了，因为神将他取去”的含义（22-24节）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]464.</strong> The church called Enoch is described as developing doctrine out of the things revealed to and perceived by the earliest church. Although this doctrine was not of any use at that point, it was preserved for use by later generations. This is expressed in the words Enoch was no more, because God took him (verses 22, 23, 24). </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 464</b></p><p><b>464.</b>
The church called "Enoch" is described as framing doctrine from what was revealed to and perceived by the Most Ancient Church, which doctrine, although of no use at that time, was preserved for the use 
of posterity. This is signified by its being said that "Enoch was no more, because God took him" (verses 22-24). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 464</b></p><p><b>464.</b>
The Church called Enoch is described as one that produced doctrine out of what had been revealed to, and perceived by, the Most Ancient Church. Although this doctrine had no use at that time, it was 
nevertheless preserved for use among their descendants. This is the meaning of the statement 'Enoch was no more, for God took him', verses 22-24.  </p>

Ecclesia Hanoch dicta describitur, quod ex revelatis perceptis Antiquissimae Ecclesiae doctrinam fecerit; quae tametsi illo tempore nulli usui fuit, usque conservata in usum posteritatis quod est, quod 
'Hanoch non amplius, quia sumpsit illum Deus,' vers. 22-24. </p>
