<p><strong>[NCE]1534.</strong> In the other life, the most miraculous things present themselves to the eyesight of spirits and angels, thanks to light radiating from its heavenly and spiritual origin in the Lord. These sights include parks, cities, palaces, houses, the most beautiful kinds of atmosphere, and much else besides. See the continuation concerning light at the end of the present chapter [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1534/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1619" target=_top>1619-1633</a>]. </p>

That by the aid of the light from a celestial and spiritual origin from the Lord, there are in the other life presented before the sight of spirits and angels most wonderful objects, such as paradises, 
cities, palaces, dwellings, the most beautiful atmospheres, and others besides, see the "Continuation concerning Light" at the end of this chapter.       GENESIS 13      1. And Abram went up out 
of Egypt, he and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, toward the south.      2. And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.      3. And he went according to his journeys 
from the south and even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent was at the first, between Bethel and Ai.      4. Unto the place of the altar which he had made there in the beginning; and there Abram 
called on the name of Jehovah.      5. And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flock and herd, and tents.      6. And the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together, for their substance 
was great, so that they could not dwell together.      7. And there was strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle; and the Canaanite and the Perizzite were then 
dwelling in the land.      8. And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no contention, I pray, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen, for we are men brethren.      9. Is not the 
whole land before thee? Separate, I pray, from me; if to the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if to the right hand, then I will go to the left.      10. And Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw 
all the plain of Jordan, that it was all well watered, before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt in coming to Zoar.      11. And Lot chose him 
all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed from the east; and they were separated, a man from his brother.      12. Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain, and pitched 
his tent as far as Sodom.      13. And the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners against Jehovah exceedingly.      14. And Jehovah said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift 
up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward.      15. For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed, forever.  
    16. And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth; so that if anyone can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.      17. Arise, walk through the land, in 
the length of it and in the breadth of it; for unto thee will I give it.      18. And Abram pitched his tent, and came, and dwelt in the oak-groves of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built there an 
altar unto Jehovah. </p>

At the end of this chapter, where the subject of light is continued, it may be seen that in the next life, thanks to the light coming from the Lord - from a celestial and spiritual origin - absolutely 
marvellous sights present themselves before spirits' and angers' sense of sight, such as the paradise gardens, cities, palaces, homes, most beautiful skies, and many other things besides. </p>

<p>CAPUT XIII 1.  Et ascendit Abram ex Aegypto, ipse et uxor illius, et omne quod illi, et Lot cum 
illo, versus meridiem. 2.  Et Abram gravis valde pecore, argento et auro. 3.  Et ivit secundum itinera sua, a meridie et usque Bethelem, usque ad locum, ubi fuit tentorium illius in initio, inter 
Bethel et inter Ai. 4.  Ad locum altaris quod fecit ibi in principio; et invocavit ibi Abram nomen JEHOVAH. 5.  Et etiam Loto eunti cum Abramo, fuit grex et armentum, et tentoria. 6.  Et non ferebat 
illos terra ad habitandum simul, quia fuit acquisitio illorum magna, et non potuerunt habitare simul. 7.  Et fuit lis inter pastores pecoris Abrami, et inter pastores Pecoris Loti: et Canaanita et 
Perizzita tunc habitans in terra. 8.  Et dixit Abram ad Lotum, Ne quaeso sit contentio inter me et inter te, et inter pastores meos et inter pastores tuos, quia viri fratres nos. 9.  Nonne tota terra 
coram te? separare quaeso a me, si ad sinistram et ibo dextram, et si ad dextram et ibo sinistram. 10.  Et sustulit Lot oculos suos, et vidit omnem planitiem Jardenis, quod tota ea irrigua, antequam 
perdidit JEHOVAH Sodomam et Amoram, sicut hortus JEHOVAE, sicut terra Aegypti veniendo Zoar. 11.  Et elegit sibi Lot omnem planitiem Jardenis; et profectus Lot ab oriente, et separabantur vir a fratre 
suo. 12.  Abram habitabat in terra Canaanis, et Lot habitavit in urbibus planitiei, et tentoriavit usque ad Sodomam. 13.  Et viri Sodomae mali et peccatores JEHOVAE valde. 14.  Et JEHOVAE dixit 
ad Abram, postquam separatus Lot ab Tolle quaeso oculos tuos, et vide e loco quo tu ibi, versus septentrionem, et versus meridiem, et versus orientem, et versus occidentem. 15.  Quia omnem terram quam 
tu vides, tibi dabo illam, et semini tuo usque in aeternam. 16.  Et ponam semen tuum sicut pulverem terrae, quod si possit quis numerare pulverem terrae, etiam semen tuum numerabitur. 17.  Surge, 
ambula per terram, secundum longitudinem ejus, et secundum latitudinem ejus, quia tibi dabo illam. 18.  Et tentoriavit Abram, et venit et habitavit in quercetis Mamre quae in Hebron, et aedificabat 
ibi altare Jehovae. </p>
