THE INTERNAL SENSE Verses 1-4. And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the sons of Israel, that they turn back and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal-zephon; 
over against it shall ye encamp by the sea. And Pharaoh will say of the sons of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut upon them. And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he shall 
follow after them; and I will be glorified in Pharaoh, and in all his army; and the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah. And they did so. "And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying," signifies instruction 
by the Divine by means of Divine truth; "Speak unto the sons of Israel," signifies the influx of truth Divine with those who are of the spiritual church; "that they turn back," signifies that 
they were not yet prepared; "and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal-zephon," signifies the beginning of a state for undergoing temptations; "over against it shall ye encamp 
by the sea," signifies that the influx of temptation is thence; "and Pharaoh will say of the sons of Israel," signifies the thought of those who are in damnation concerning the state of those who 
are of the spiritual church; "They are entangled in the land," signifies that they are in confusion in respect to the things of the church; "the wilderness hath shut upon them," signifies that obscurity 
has taken possession of them; "and I will harden Pharaoh's heart," signifies that they who were in falsities from evil would still be determined; "and he shall follow after them," signifies that they 
would still endeavor to subjugate them; "and I will be glorified," signifies that they should see a Divine effect from the Divine Human of the Lord in the dissipation of falsity; "in Pharaoh, and 
in all his army," signifies the immersion in hell of those who were in falsities from evil, and an environment there by falsities as by waters; "and the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah," signifies 
that from this it will be known that the Lord is the only God; "and they did so," signifies obedience. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE </p>
<p>Verses 1-4 And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to the children of Israel, and let them turn back and encamp before Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal Zephon; 
over against it you are to encamp, close to the sea. And Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are enmeshed in the land; the wilderness has shut them in. And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, 
and he will pursue them, and I will be glorified in Pharaoh and in all his army; and the Egyptians will know that I am Jehovah. And they did so </p>
<p>'And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying' means instruction 
received from the Divine through Divine Truth. 'Speak to the children of Israel' means the influx of God's truth among those belonging to the spiritual Church. 'And let them turn back' means that 
they have not yet been prepared. 'And encamp before Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal Zephon' means the beginning of the state for undergoing temptations. 'Over against it you are 
to encamp, close to the sea' means that the influx of temptation comes from there. 'And Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel' means the thought of those lost in damnation regarding the state of 
those belonging to the spiritual Church. 'They are enmeshed in the land' means that they are in a state of confusion so far as things of the Church are concerned. 'The wilderness has shut them in' means 
that obscurity has taken hold of them. 'And I will harden Pharaoh's heart' means that the obstinacy of those steeped in falsities arising from evil would still remain. 'And he will pursue them' means 
that they would go on trying to bring them under their control. 'And I will be glorified' means that they were about to see a Divine feat, accomplished by the Lord's Divine Human, in the dispersion 
of falsity. 'In Pharaoh and in all his army' means the submersion into hell of those steeped in falsities arising from evil, and their encompassment there by falsities as if by waters. 'And the Egyptians 
will know that I am Jehovah' means that it will thereby be made known that the Lord is the only God. 'And they did so' means obedience. </p>

SENSUS INTERNUS </p>
<p>Vers. 1-4.  Et locutus est Jehovah ad Moschen, dicendo, Loquere ad filios Israelis, et revertantur et (x)castrametentur ante Pi-Chiroth, inter Migdal et inter mare, ante Baal-Zephon, 
e regione ejus castrametemini juxta mare.  Et dicet Pharao de filiis Israelis, Perplexi illi in terra, conclusit super illos desertum.  Et indurabo cor Pharaonis, et persequetur post illos, et glorificabor 
in Pharaone et in omni exercitu illius; et scient Aegyptii quod Ego Jehovah: et fecerunt ita.  `Et locutus est Jehovah ad Moschen, dicendo' significat instructionem a Divino per Divinum Verum: 
`Loquere ad filios Israelis' significat influxum veri Divini apud illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali: `et revertantur' significat quod nondum praeparati: `et castrametentur ante Pi-Chiroth, inter Migdal 
et inter mare, ante Baal-Zephon' {1}significat principium status ad subeundas tentationes: `e regione ejus castrametemini juxta mare' significat quod inde tentationis influxus: `et dicet Pharao de 
filiis Israelis' significat cogitationem illorum qui in damnatione de statu illorum qui ab Ecclesia spirituali: `Perplexi illi in terra' significat quod in confuso sint quoad illa quae sunt Ecclesiae: 
`conclusit super illos desertum' significat quod obscuritas illos occupaverit: `et indurabo cor Pharaonis' significat quod obstinarent se adhuc qui in falsis a malo: `et persequetur post illos' significat 
quod adhuc conarentur subjugare illos: `et glorificabor' significat quod visuri effectum Divinum ex Divino Humano Domini in dissipatione falsi: `in Pharaone et in omni exercitu illius' significat 
immersionem illorum qui in falsis ex malo in infernum, {2}et obstipationem ibi a falsis sicut ab aquis: `et scient Aegyptii quod Ego Jehovah' significat quod inde notum quod Dominus sit solus Deus: 
`et fecerunt ita' significat oboedientiam. 	@1 quod significet$ 	@2 ac falsorum obstinationem, ac in falsa illorum$ </p>
