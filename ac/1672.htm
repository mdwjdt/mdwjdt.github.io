<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1672节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1672.</strong> “与他结盟的王”表伴随这良善的表面真理。这从圣言中“王”的含义清楚可知。在圣言的历史和预言部分，“列王”、“列国”和“列民”表真理和属真理之物，这可通过大量经文得以证实。在圣言中，要仔细区分人民（people）和民族：“人民”表真理，“民族”表良善，如前所示（<a href="1259.htm">1259</a>，<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>节）。列王涉及列民，不怎么涉及列族。以色列人在寻求王之前，是一个民族；但他们渴求并接受一个王后，就变成了“人民”，不再代表良善或属天之物，而是代表真理或属灵之物，这就是为何这被视为是他们过错的原因（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上8.7.htm">8:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上8.22.htm">22</a>）。对此，蒙主怜悯，将在别处予以解释。由于本节论及“基大老玛”，然后经上又补充“与他结盟的王”，故既表良善，也表真理：“基大老玛”表良善，诸“王”表真理。前面已阐明，主的试探开始时它是哪种良善与真理。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1672.</strong> The symbolism of and the kings who were with him as apparent truth linked with that goodness can be seen from the symbolism of kings in the Word. In the narrative and prophetic parts of the Word, monarchs, kingdoms, and peoples symbolize truth and everything connected with truth, as a great deal of evidence can confirm.{*1} The Word carefully distinguishes between a people and a nation; a people symbolizes truth, and a nation, goodness, as shown previously, in 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1672/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1259" target=_top>1259</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1672/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1260" target=_top>1260</a>. Peoples are said to have monarchs; nations for the most part are not. Before the children of Israel agitated for kings, they were a nation and represented goodness, or a heavenly quality. After they sought and received a king, they became a people and represented not goodness (or a heavenly quality) but truth (or a spiritual quality). This was the reason it counted against them as a flaw (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1672/bible_king-james-version_1-samuel_8_7-22" target=_top>1 Samuel 8:7-22</a>). I will have more to say on this elsewhere, with the Lord's divine mercy.{*2} Because the text here mentions Chedorlaomer and adds "the kings who were with him," both goodness and truth are symbolized 钬?goodness, by Chedorlaomer; truth, by the kings. But the nature of that goodness and truth at the threshold of the Lord's trials has been described above [搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1672/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1661" target=_top>1661</a>].<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For a list of the narrative and prophetic books of the Word, see 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1672/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2606" target=_top>2606</a>, or note 1 in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1672/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_64" target=_top>64</a>.

And the kings that were with him. That this signifies the apparent truth which is of that good, is evident from the signification of "kings" in the Word. "Kings," "kingdoms," and "peoples," in the historical 
and the prophetical parts of the Word, signify truths and the things which are of truths, as may be abundantly confirmed. In the Word an accurate distinction is made between a "people" and a 
"nation;" by a "people" are signified truths, and by a "nation" goods, as before shown (n. 1259, 1260). "Kings" are predicated of peoples, but not so much of nations. Before the sons of Israel sought 
for kings, they were a nation, and represented good, or the celestial; but after they desired a king, and received one, they became a people, and did not represent good or the celestial, but truth or 
the spiritual; which was the reason why this was imputed to them as a fault (see 1 Sam. 8:7-22, concerning which subject, of the Lord's Divine mercy elsewhere). As Chedorlaomer is named here, and it is 
added, "the kings that were with him," both good and truth are signified; by "Chedorlaomer," good, and by "the kings," truth. But what was the quality of the good and truth at the beginning of the Lord's 
temptations has already been stated.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1672</b></p><p><b>1672.</b>
'And the kings who were with him' means the apparent truth that goes with that good. This is clear from the meaning of 'kings' in the Word. Kings, kingdoms, and peoples in the historical and prophetical 
sections of the Word mean truths and the things that belong to truths, as may be confirmed from many places. In the Word a careful distinction is made between people and nation, 'people' meaning truths, 
'nation' goods, as shown already in <a href="1259.htm">1259</a>, <a href="1260.htm">1260</a>. Kings have reference to peoples, and not so much to nations. The children of Israel, before they sought to have kings, were 'a nation' and represented 
good, or that which is celestial; but after they desired a king and received one, they became 'a people' and represented not good or that which is celestial, but truth or that which is spiritual, 
and this was the reason why this was ascribed to them as a fault in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1%20Sam%208:7-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">1 Sam 8:7-end</a>. This, in the Lord's Divine mercy, will be explained elsewhere. In the present verse, since 'Chedorlaomer' is referred 
to, and then the phrase 'the kings who were with him' is added, both good and truth are meant- good by 'Chedorlaomer' and truth by 'the kings'. But what kind of good and truth it was when the Lord's 
temptations first began has been stated above. </p>

'Et reges qui cum illo': quod significent verum apparens quod est boni illius, constat ex significatione 'regum' in Verbo; 'reges, regna, et populi' in historicis et propheticis Verbi significant vera 
et quae veritatum sunt, quod multis confirmari potest; in Verbo accurate distinguitur inter populum et gentem; per 'populum' significantur vera, per 'gentem' bona, ut ostensum prius n. 1259, 1260; 
reges praedicantur de populis, non ita de gentibus; filii Israelis antequam reges ambiebant, fuerunt 'gens,' et repraesentabant bonum seu caeleste; at postquam cupiverunt regem et acceperunt, facti sunt 
'populus,' et non repraesentabant bonum seu caeleste, sed verum seu spirituale, quae causa fuit quod hoc illis imputatum sit in vitium, 1 Sam. viii 7 ad fin., de qua re, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, 
alibi: hic quia nominatur Kedorlaomer et additur 'reges qui cum illo,' significatur tam bonum quam verum, per 'Kedorlaomerum' bonum, per 'reges' verum, sed quale fuit bonum et verum in principio tentationum 
Domini supra dictum. </p>
