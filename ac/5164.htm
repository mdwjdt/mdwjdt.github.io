<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5164节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5164.</strong>“在众臣仆当中”表在那些存在于外层属世层里面的事物当中之物。这从“在当中”和“臣仆”的含义清楚可知：“在当中”是指在这些事物当中；“臣仆”，即仆人是指在外层属世层里面的事物，如刚才所述（<a href="5161.htm">5161</a>节）。在圣言中，凡在下面，因而处于次要地位并服从高级事物之物都被称为“仆人”。存在于外层属世层里面的事物，或那里的感官印象相对于内层属世层，就是这种情况；而存在于这内层属世层里面的事物相对于理性层也被称为“仆人”。因此，人里面的一切事物，无论总体还是细节，同样无论是至内在的还是至外在的，相对于神性都被称为“仆人”，因为神性是至高无上的。<br />此处“臣仆”是指宫里的王公贵族，法老王在他们当中审判酒政和膳长。相对于王，这些人之所以和其它各阶层的臣民一样被称为仆人（这也如今每个国家的情形），是因为王权代表神性真理方面的主（参看<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>，<a href="3009.htm">3009</a>，<a href="3670.htm">3670</a>，<a href="4581.htm">4581</a>，<a href="4966.htm">4966</a>，<a href="5068.htm">5068</a>节）。相对于主，所有人都是一样的仆人，无论他们属于哪个社会阶层。事实上，在主的国度，也就是在天堂，那些最大，也就是至内在的人比其他人更是仆人，因为他们的顺服是最大的，他们的谦卑比其他人的更大。他们就是最大的最小之人和首先的末后之人所指的人：<br />首先的必成了末后的，末后的必成了首先的！（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太19.30.htm">19:30</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.16.htm">20:16</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.31.htm">10:31</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.30.htm">13:30</a>）<br />你们中间最小的，他便为大。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.48.htm">9:48</a>）<br />他们也是“作用人的大人”和“作仆人的为首之人”所指的人：<br />你们中间，谁愿为大，就必作你们的用人；在你们中间，谁愿为首，就必作众人的仆人。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.44.htm">10:44</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.26.htm">20:26</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.27.htm">27</a>）<br />相对于源于主的神性真理，他们被称为“仆人”；相对于源于主的神性良善，他们被称为“用人”。“为首的末后之人”之所以比其他人更是仆人，是因为他们知道、承认并发觉他们所拥有的全部生命，因而全部能力皆源于主，丝毫不源于他们自己；而那些因没有如此大的承认而没有发觉这一点的人也是仆人，然而更多地是因为这承认是他们口头上的承认，而非发自他们内心的承认。但是，那些态度完全相反的人相对于神性也自称仆人，然他们的真实愿望是要作主人。事实上，如果神性不支持他们，可以说顺从他们，他们就会生气发怒，最终反对神性，将一切能力从神性那里夺走，将一切事物归于自己。像这样的人在教会里比比皆是；他们不接受主，尽管他们声称自己承认一位至高无上的存在。</p>

In the midst of his servants. That this signifies that were among those things that were in the exterior natural, is evident from the signification of "in the midst," as being among them; and from the 
signification of "servants," as being the things in the exterior natural (of which just above, n. 5161). In the Word all things are called "servants" that are beneath and are therefore subordinate and 
subject to what is higher, just as those things which are of the exterior natural, or the sensuous things therein, are in respect to the interior natural; and the things of the latter also are called 
"servants" in respect to the rational; and consequently all things in man both in general and in particular, and equally so whether inmost or outmost, are called "servants" relatively to the Divine, 
for this is supreme.  [2] The "servants" here, in the midst of whom Pharaoh the king executed judgment upon the butler and the baker, were the princes and grandees of the palace; and the reason why 
these, like other subjects of every condition, are called "servants" relatively to the king (as is also the case in every kingdom at this day) is that royalty represents the Lord as to Divine truth (see 
n. 2015, 2069, 3009, 3670, 4581, 4966, 5068), in respect to whom all are alike servants, whatever their condition may be; and in the Lord's kingdom or heaven they who are the greatest (that is, they 
who are inmost) are servants more than others, because they are in the greatest obedience, and in deeper humiliation than the rest; for these are they who are meant by the "least that shall be greatest," 
and by the "last that shall be first": </p>
<p>	The first shall be last, and the last shall be first (Matt. 19:30; 20:16; Mark 10:31; Luke 13:30). 	He that is least among you, the same shall be great 
(Luke 9:48); </p>
<p>and also by the "great who should be ministers," and by the "first who should be servants": </p>
<p>	Whosoever would be great among you shall be your minister; and whosoever would be first of 
you, shall be servant of all (Mark 10:44; Matt. 20:26-27). [3] They are called "servants" relatively to the Divine truth which is from the Lord, and "ministers" relatively to the Divine good which is 
from Him. The reason why the "last who are first" are servants more fully than others is that they know, acknowledge, and perceive, that everything of life, and consequently everything of power which 
they have, is from the Lord and not at all from themselves; whereas they who do not perceive this, because they do not so acknowledge, are also servants, yet more in the acknowledgment of the lips than 
of the heart. But they who are in what is contrary call themselves "servants" relatively to the Divine, and yet desire to be masters; for they are indignant and angry if the Divine does not favor them 
and as it were obey them; and at last they are opposed to the Divine, and take away all power from the Divine, and attribute all things to themselves. There are very many of this character within 
the church, who deny the Lord, and say they acknowledge one supreme Being. </p>

'in the midst of his servants' means which were among the things present in the exterior natural. This is clear from the meaning of 'in the midst' as among those things; and from the meaning of 'servants' 
as the things within the exterior natural, dealt with just above in <a href="5161.htm">5161</a>. In the Word all things that occupy a lower position and are therefore subordinate and subject to higher ones are called 
'servants'. This is so in the case of things present in the exterior natural - that is, the sensory impressions there - when considered in relation to the interior natural. The things present in this 
interior natural, when considered in relation to the rational, are also referred to as 'servants'. Consequently every single thing present in a person, inmost ones no less than outermost, are called such 
when considered in relation to the Divine, since the Divine is the highest of all. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The servants here in whose midst Pharaoh the king passed judgement on the cupbearer and the baker were chief 
courtiers and nobles. The reason why these, like other subjects belonging to any other rank of society, are called servants when considered in relation to the king is that, as is the case in any kingdom 
even today, kingship represents the Lord as regards Divine Truth, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="2069.htm">2069</a>, <a href="3009.htm">3009</a>, <a href="3670.htm">3670</a>, <a href="4581.htm">4581</a>, <a href="4966.htm">4966</a>, <a href="5068.htm">5068</a>. Considered in relation to Him all are equally servants, no matter what rank of society 
they belong to. Indeed in the Lord's kingdom, that is, in heaven, those who are the greatest there, that is, who are the inmost ones, are pre-eminently servants because their obedience is the greatest 
of all, and their humility is greater than that of any others. These are the ones who are meant by the least who will be the greatest, and the last who will be the first, </p>

 They 
are called 'servants' in relation to the Divine Truth which originates in the Lord and 'ministers' in relation to the Divine Good which originates in Him. The reason 'the last who are the first' are 
servants, and more so than any others, is that they know, acknowledge, and perceive that the whole of their life, and therefore the whole of the power which they possess, originates in the Lord, and 
none at all in themselves; and those who do not perceive this because their acknowledgement of it is not so great are 'servants' too, though more because that acknowledgement is one that is on their lips 
rather than in their hearts. Those however whose attitude is completely the reverse also call themselves servants in relation to the Divine; yet their real wish is to be masters. For they are annoyed 
and angry if the Divine does not show them favour or so to speak does not obey them, and at length they set themselves against the Divine, when they take away all power from Him and attribute everything 
to themselves. Very many like these exist within the Church; they do not accept the Lord, though they do say that they acknowledge a supreme being. </p>

`In medio servorum suorum': quod significet quae inter illa quae in exteriore naturali, constat ex significatione `in medio' quod sit inter illa; et ex significatione `servorum' quod sint illa quae 
in exteriore naturali, de qua mox supra n. 5161; `servi' in Verbo vocantur omnia quae infra sunt, et inde subordinata et subjecta superioribus, sicut illa quae sunt naturalis exterioris, seu sensualia 
ibi, respective ad interius naturale, etiam ea quae sunt hujus naturalis dicuntur `servi' respective ad rationale; et consequenter omnia et singula apud hominem, aeque ejus intima quam extima, 
respective ad Divinum, nam hoc supremum est. (m)Servi hic in quorum medio 2 Pharaoh rex judicium fecit super pincernam et pistorem, fuerunt principes aulici et magnates; quod hi similiter ac alii 
subditi, ex quacumque conditione, respective ad regem dicantur servi, sicut fit in omni regno etiam hodie,(n) est causa quia `regium' repraesentat Dominum quod Divinum Verum, n. 2015,2069, 3009, 
3670, 4581, 4966, 5068, ad Quem respective, ex quacumque conditione sint, omnes aeque servi sunt; immo in regno Domini seu caelo illi qui ibi maximi sunt, hoc est, qui intimi, sunt servi prae aliis 
quia illi in maxima oboedientia sunt, et prae reliquis in humiliatione; sunt enim illi qui intelliguntur per minimos qui maximi, et per novissimos qui primi,           Primi erunt novissimi, et novissimi 
erunt primi, Matth. xix 30; xx 16; Marc. x 31; Luc. xiii 30: </p>
<p>          Qui minimus inter omnes vos existit,  {2}is erit magnus, Luc. ix 48: </p>
<p>{3}tum per magnos qui ministri, et per primos qui 
servi,           Quisquis voluerit esse magnus inter vos, erit minister vester; et quicumque voluerit vestrum esse primus, erit omnium servus, Marc. x 44; Matth. xx 26, 27; </p>
<p>`servi' dicuntur respective 
ad Divinum Verum quod a Domino, et 3 `ministri' respective ad Divinum Bonum ab Ipso; causa quod `novissimi qui primi' sint servi prae aliis, est quia sciunt, agnoscunt, et percipiunt quod omne 
vitae, proinde quod omne potestatis quae illis, sit a Domino, et prorsus nihil a semet; at qui hoc non percipiunt quia non ita agnoscunt, sunt quoque `servi', sed plus agnitione oris quam cordis; 
qui autem in contrario sunt, illi se quoque servos seu famulos respective ad Divinum vocant, sed usque volunt esse domini; indignantur enim et irascuntur si Divinum illis non favet et quasi oboedit, 
et tandem contra Divinum sunt, et tunc Divino omnem potentiam derogant et sibi omnia tribuunt plerique tales sunt intra Ecclesiam, qui negant Dominum et dicunt se agnoscere unum ens supremum. @1
