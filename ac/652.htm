<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第652节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>652.</strong>“窗户”表觉知部分，“门”表聆听，因此本节的主题是人的觉知部分。这一点从前面所述清楚可知，即该教会成员以下列方式被改造：人里面有两个生命，一个属意愿，另一个属觉知。当意愿不存在，恶欲取而代之时，它们就变成两个生命。能被改造的是第二或觉知部分，然后新的意愿通过这觉知被赋予，以便这二者，即仁与信，仍构成一个生命。由于人目前的情况是没有意愿，取而代之的是纯粹的恶欲，故属意愿的这部分被关闭了，如14节所述，而第二或觉知部分则被打开。这就是本节的主题。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]652.</strong> The symbolism of the window as the ability to understand and of the door as hearing the message, and the resulting theme of this verse as a person's intellectual side, are indicated by what was said above. To be specific, the intellect was said to be the means of reformation for the people of that church [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_652/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_641" target=_top>641</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_652/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_642" target=_top>642</a>].<br /> [Nowadays] people have two kinds of life, one belonging to the will and the other to the intellect. These become two kinds of life when will is absent and desire takes its place. The second, intellectual half is the part then capable of reforming. When the intellect has been reformed, we are able to receive a new will through it, allowing the two (that is, charity and faith) to continue as a single force in our lives.<br />Since at this point people were such that they had no will, but mere desire instead, the volitional side was closed off, as noted at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_652/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_14" target=_top>14</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_652/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_640" target=_top>640-642</a>], and the other, intellectual side opened up, as described in the current verse. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 652</b></p><p><b>652.</b>
That the "window" signifies the intellectual part, and the "door" hearing, and thus that in this verse the intellectual part of man is treated of, is evident from what has been stated before: that the 
man of that church was reformed in this way. There are two lives in man; one is of the will, the other of the understanding. They become two lives when there is no will, but cupidity in place of a will. 
Then it is the other or intellectual part that can be reformed; and afterwards through this a new will can be given, so that the two may still constitute one life, namely, charity and faith. Because 
man was now such that he had no will, but mere cupidity in place of it, the part which belongs to the will was closed-as stated at verse 14-and the other or intellectual part was opened; which is 
the subject treated of in this verse. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 652</b></p><p><b>652.</b>
That 'window' means the understanding part, and 'door' hearing, and thus the subject in this verse is man's understanding part, becomes clear from what has been stated already, namely that the member 
of this Church was reformed in the following way: In man life is twofold, one life being that of the will, the other that of the understanding. They come to be two when no will is present and evil desire 
takes the place of will. The second or understanding part is the one that is able in those circumstances to be reformed, and through this reformed understanding a new will can subsequently be conferred, 
with the result that they - that is to say, charity and faith - constitute one life. Now because man was such that no will was present and wholly evil desire existed instead, that part which is 
that of the will was closed, as stated at verse 14, while the second or understanding part was open; this is the subject in the present verse. </p>

</p><b>652.</b>
Quod 'fenestra' significet intellectuale, et 'janua' auditionem, et sic in hoc versu agatur de parte hominis intellectuali, constare potest ab illis quae prius dicta sunt, quod nempe homo hujus Ecclesiae 
reformabatur ita: sunt in homine binae vitae, una est voluntatis, altera est intellectus; binae vitae fiunt, cum nulla voluntas, sed pro voluntate cupiditas; pars altera seu intellectualis est quae 
tunc potest reformari, et postea per eam dari nova voluntas, sic ut usque unam vitam constituant, nempe charitas et fides: quia nunc homo talis erat ut nulla voluntas, sed pro ea mera cupiditas, ea 
pars quae voluntatis est, clausa erat, sicut ad vers. 14 dictum, et altera pars seu intellectualis aperiebatur, de qua in hoc versu agitur. </p>
