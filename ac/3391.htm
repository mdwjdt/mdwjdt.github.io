<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3391节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3391.</strong>“非利士人的王亚比米勒从窗户里往外观看”表关注含有认知的理性事物的信之教义。这从“亚比米勒”的代表，以及“非利士人的王”和“窗户”的含义清楚可知：“亚比米勒”是指关注理性事物的信之教义（<a href="2504.htm">2504</a>，<a href="2509.htm">2509</a>，<a href="2510.htm">2510</a>，<a href="2533.htm">2533</a>节）；“非利士人的王”是指教义事物（<a href="3365.htm">3365</a>节）；“窗户”是指心智的理解力部分（<a href="655.htm">655</a>，<a href="658.htm">658</a>节），因而是指内在视觉，因为这在前面由“窗户”来表示。因此，“从窗户里往外观看”是指发觉通过内视所看到的事物。一般来说，这些事物属于外在人的认知。但理性事物，或也可说，真理的表象，就是属灵的真理（<a href="3368.htm">3368</a>节），并非认知，而是含有认知，因为它们属于理性，因而属于内在人，正是内在人关注外在人的事物，因而关注含有认知的真理。由于认知属于属世人，所以它们是接受理性事物的器皿。因为神圣真理流入心智的理性部分，并经由这理性部分流入属世部分，在属世部分像许多物体所产生的形像映在镜中那样呈现自己（参看<a href="3368.htm">3368</a>节）。<br />“窗户”表构成内视，也就是理解力的事物，这些事物用“智性概念”（intellectual concept）这样一个术语来称谓。这一点从前面（<a href="655.htm">655</a>节）所引用的圣言经文，以及下列经文明显看出来。约珥书：<br />他们蹦上城，蹿上墙，爬进房屋，像盗贼由窗户进去。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.9.htm">2:9</a>）<br />这论及教会末日的邪恶与虚假。“爬进房屋”表摧毁意愿的良善，“房屋”表意愿的良善（参看<a href="710.htm">710</a>，<a href="2233.htm">2233</a>，<a href="2234.htm">2234</a>节）；“由窗户进去”表摧毁真理及其属于理解力的认知。西番雅书：<br />耶和华必伸手攻击北方，毁灭亚述；群畜，就是各类的野兽，必卧在其中。鹈鹕和鱼鹰要在其石榴树上过夜；在窗户内有鸣叫的声音。门槛都必毁坏。香柏木已经露出。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番2.13.htm">2:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/番2.14.htm">14</a>）<br />这论及信之真理因推理，就是“亚述”而毁灭（<a href="119.htm">119</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>节）。“在窗户内有鸣叫的声音”表真理的荒凉，因而理解真理的能力的荒凉。<br />士师记：<br />西西拉的母亲，从窗户里往外观看，从窗棂中呼叫，他的战车为何迟迟不来？（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士5.28.htm">5:28</a>）<br />这些话是对底波拉和巴拉的预言，与属灵教会的复兴有关。“从窗户里往外观看”表通过那些否认真理，从而摧毁属教会的事物之人的推理；因为这类推理就是反面意义上的智性概念。耶利米书：<br />那凭不义盖房、凭不公建室，有祸了！他说，我要为自己盖广大的房、宽敞的室，为它开窗户；它以香柏木为墙板，漆上丹红色。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶22.13.htm">22:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶22.14.htm">14</a>）<br />“凭不义盖房、凭不公建室”表通过非良善与真理之物构筑一个宗教体系，“公义和公平”是指良善与真理（参看<a href="2235.htm">2235</a>节）。“为它开窗户，它以香柏木为墙板，漆上丹红色”表伪造智性和属灵的真理。耶路撒冷圣殿的窗户无非代表诸如构成智性、因而属灵概念的那类事物。以西结书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/结40.16.htm">40:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结40.22.htm">22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结40.25.htm">25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结40.33.htm">33</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结40.36.htm">36</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结41.16.htm">41:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结41.26.htm">26</a>）所提到的新圣殿的窗户具有同样的含义，因为谁都能看出，该先知书所描述的新圣殿、新耶路撒冷、新地无非表示主的国度；因此所提到的有关它们的细节就是诸如属于其国度的那类事物。</p>

And Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out through a window, and saw. That this signifies the doctrine of faith looking to rational things in knowledges, is evident from the representation of Abimelech, 
as being the doctrine of faith that looks to rational things (n. 2504, 2509, 2510, 2533); from the signification of "king of the Philistines" as being doctrinal things (n. 3365); and from the 
signification of a window," as being the intellectual faculty (n. 655, 658), consequently the internal sight, for this was formerly signified by "windows." Thus to "look out through a window" is to 
perceive those things which appear by means of the internal sight, which in general are knowledges such as are of the external man. Rational things, or what is the same, appearances of truth, that is, 
truths spiritual, are not knowledges, but are in knowledges, for they belong to the rational, thus to the internal man, and it is the internal man which looks to the things of the external man, thus 
to truths in knowledges. For as knowledges are of the natural man, they are vessels that receive rational things (that truths Divine flow into the rational, and through this into the natural, and in this 
latter are exhibited as an image of many things in a mirror, may be seen above, n. 3368). [2] That "windows" signify the things of the internal sight-that is, of the understanding-which in one word 
are called intellectual things, is evident from those passages of the Word which were adduced in n. 655; and further from the following. In Joel: </p>
<p>     They shall run to and fro in the city, they shall 
run upon the wall, they shall climb up into the houses, they shall enter in by the windows as a thief (Joel 2:9); </p>
<p>speaking of the evils and falsities of the last days of the church; "climbing up 
into the houses" denotes destroying the goods of the will (that "house" denotes the goods of the will may be seen above, n. 710, 2233, 2334); and "entering in by the windows" denotes destroying truths 
and their knowledges which are of the understanding. In Zephaniah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah will stretch out His hands upon the north, and destroy Asshur; herds shall lie down in the midst of her; every wild animal 
of his kind; both the pelican and the osprey, shall pass the night in the pomegranates thereof; a voice shall sing in the windows, drought shall be upon the threshold, because he hath laid bare 
the cedar (Zeph. 2:13-14); </p>
<p>where the destruction of the truths of faith by reasonings, which are "Asshur," is treated of (n. 119, 1186); that a "voice shall sing in the windows" signifies the desolation 
of truth, thus of the intellectual faculty as to truth. [3] In the book of Judges: </p>
<p>     Through the window she looked forth, and the mother of Sisera cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot 
so long in coming? (Judg. 5:28); </p>
<p>this is the prophecy of Deborah and Barak concerning the resuscitation of a spiritual church; "looking forth through a window" denotes through the reasonings of those 
who deny truths and thus destroy what is of the church; for such reasonings are intellectual things in the opposite sense. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Woe unto him that buildeth his house without righteousness, 
and his chambers without judgment; that saith, I will build me a roomy house and spacious chambers; and cutteth him out windows; and it is ceiled with cedar, and painted with vermilion (Jer. 22:13-14); </p>
<p>"building 
a house without righteousness, and chambers without judgment" denotes building up a religious system from what is not good and not true (that "righteousness and judgment" are good and 
truth may be seen above, n. 2235); "cutting him out windows and ceiling with cedar, and painting with vermilion," denotes falsifying intellectual and spiritual truths. The windows of the temple at Jerusalem 
represented nothing but that which belongs to intellectual and thus to spiritual things. The like is signified by the windows of the new temple described in Ezekiel (40:16, 22, 25, 33, 36; 41:16, 
26); for anyone can see that in this Prophet the new temple, the new Jerusalem, and the new earth, are nothing else than the Lord's kingdom; thus that the things mentioned in regard to them are such 
as belong to His kingdom. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3391</b></p><p><b>3391.</b>
'That Abimelech the king of the Philistines looked through a window and saw' means the doctrine of faith which has regard to rational concepts held within cognitions. This is clear from the representation 
of 'Abimelech' as the doctrine of faith which has regard to rational concepts, dealt with in <a href="2504.htm">2504</a>, <a href="2509.htm">2509</a>, <a href="2510.htm">2510</a>, <a href="2533.htm">2533</a>; from the meaning of 'the king of the Philistines' as matters of doctrine, dealt 
with in <a href="3365.htm">3365</a>; and from the meaning of 'a window' as the understanding part of the mind, dealt with in <a href="655.htm">655</a>, <a href="658.htm">658</a>, and therefore internal sight, for this in former times was meant by 'windows'. Thus 'looking 
through a window' is perceiving things that are seen through internal sight. In general those things are cognitions which belong to the external man; but rational concepts - or what amounts to 
the same, appearances of truth, which are spiritual truths, <a href="3368.htm">3368</a> - are not cognitions but are held within cognitions since they belong to the rational man, and so to the internal man. And it is characteristic 
of the internal man to regard the things belonging to the external man, and so to regard the truths held within cognitions. Since cognitions belong to the natural man they are consequently the 
recipient vessels for rational concepts. For Divine truths flow into the rational part of the mind and by way of the rational into the natural, where they present themselves like an image produced 
by many objects reflected in a mirror, see <a href="3368.htm">3368</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That 'windows' means the things that constitute internal sight, that is, the understanding, which are referred to by the single term 'intellectual 
concepts' is clear from the places in the Word introduced in <a href="655.htm">655</a>, as well as from the following: In Joel, </p>
<blockquote>
They will run about the city, they will run on the wall, they will climb into the houses, 
they will go in through the windows like a thief. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%202:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 2:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the evils and falsities present in the final days of the Church. 'Climbing into the houses' stands for destroying goods 
which belong to the will - 'houses' being goods that belong to the will, see <a href="710.htm">710</a>, <a href="2233.htm">2233</a>, <a href="2234.htm">2234</a>; and 'going in through the windows' for destroying truths and cognitions of those which belong to the understanding. 
In Zephaniah, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah will stretch out His hand over the north and will destroy Asshur. Herds will lie down in the midst of her, every wild beast of that nation. The spoonbill also and the 
duck will lodge in its pomegranates.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> A voice will sing in the window, dryness will be on the threshold, for the cedar has been laid bare. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zeph%202:13,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zeph 2:13, 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the destruction of the truths 
of faith by means of reasonings, meant by Asshur, <a href="119.htm">119</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>. 'A voice will sing in the window' stands for the desolation of truth, and so of the ability to understand what is true.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the 
Book of Judges, </p>
<blockquote>
She looked through the window, and the mother of Sisera exclaimed through the lattices, Why is his chariot so long in coming? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%205:28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 5:28</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>These words come in the prophecy of Deborah 
and Barak and have to do with the resurgence of the spiritual Church. 'Looking through the window' stands for the reasonings of those who deny truths and in so doing destroy things that belong to 
the Church; for such reasonings are intellectual concepts in the contrary sense. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Woe to him who builds his house without righteousness, and his upper rooms without judgement, who says, 
I will build myself a wide house and spacious upper rooms, and he cuts out windows for himself, panelling it with cedar, and paints it with vermilion. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2022:13,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 22:13, 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Building a house without righteousness, 
and upper rooms without judgement' stands for building a religion out of what is not good and not truth - 'righteousness and judgement' meaning good and truth, see <a href="2235.htm">2235</a>. 'Cutting out windows 
for oneself, panelling it with cedar, and painting it with vermilion' stands for falsifying truths, intellectual and spiritual. The windows of the Temple in Jerusalem represented nothing else than 
such things as constitute intellectual and thus spiritual concepts. The windows of the new temple that are mentioned in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezekiel%2040:16,%2022,%2025,%2033,%2036;%2041:16,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezekiel 40:16, 22, 25, 33, 36; 41:16, 26</a>, have a similar meaning, for anyone may 
see that the new temple, the new Jerusalem, and the new earth described in that prophet mean nothing else than the Lord's kingdom, and that accordingly the details mentioned concerning them are the 
kind of things that belong to that kingdom.

`Et prospexit Abimelech rex Philistaeorum trans fenestram, et vidit': quod significet doctrinam fidei spectantem rationalia in cognitionibus, constat ex repraesentatione `Abimelechi' quod sit doctrina 
fidei spectans rationalia, de qua n. 2504, 2509, 2510, 2533; et a significatione `regis Philistaeorum' quod sint doctrinalia, de qua n. 3365; et a significatione `fenestrae' quod sit intellectuale, 
de qua n. 655, 658, proinde visus internus, nam hic olim significatus est per `fenestras'; ita `prospicere trans fenestram' est percipere illa quae per visum internum apparent; haec in genere sunt cognitiones 
quae sunt externi hominis; rationalia, seu quod idem, apparentiae veri, hoc est, vera spiritualia {1}, non sunt cognitiones sed in cognitionibus, sunt enim rationalis, ita interni hominis, ac 
internus homo est qui spectat illa quae sunt externi, ita vera in cognitionibus; nam cognitiones quia sunt naturalis hominis, sunt vasa recipientia rationalium; quod vera Divina influant in rationale, 
et per hoc in naturale, et in hoc sistantur sicut multorum imago in speculo, videatur n. 3368. [2] Quod `fenestrae' sint illa quae sunt visus interni, hoc est, intellectus, quae una voce intellectualia 
vocantur, constat ab illis locis Verbi quae n. 655 allata sunt, et adhuc ab his; apud Joelem,           In urbe discurrent, in muro current, in domos ascendent,      per fenestras ingredientur 
sicut fur, ii 9; </p>

et `ingredi per fenestras' pro destruere vera ac eorum cognitiones quae sunt intellectus: apud Zephaniam,           Extendet Jehovah manum Suam super septentrionem, et      perdet Asshurem, cubabunt 
in medio ejus catervae, omnis fera      ejus gentis, etiam platea et anataria in malogranatis ejus      pernoctabunt, vox cantabit in fenestra, siccitas in limine,      quia cedrum denudavit, ii 14; </p>

Judicium,           Per fenestram prospexit, et exclamavit mater Siserae per      cancellos, Quare tardat currus ejus venire? v 28; </p>
<p>propheticum Deborae et Baraki de Ecclesiae spiritualis resuscitatione; 
`per fenestram prospicere' pro per ratiocinia {4}illorum qui vera negant, et sic illa quae Ecclesiae sunt, destruunt, illa enim sunt intellectualia in opposito sensu: apud Jeremiam,           
Vae aedificanti domum suam sine justitia, et hyperoa sua      sine judicio, qui dicit, Aedificabo mihi domum mensurarum, et      hyperoa spatiosa, et exscindit sibi fenestras, et tabulata      cedro,
