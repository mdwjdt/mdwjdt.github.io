<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1044.</strong>“这就可作我与地立约的记号了”表主以仁爱临在的标志，“地”在此指人的自我中心。这从前面所述清楚可知。“地”表人的自我中心，这一点从内义和整个思路清楚可知。前面说到，“这是在我与你们之间，并同你们一起的一切活的灵魂之间立约的记号”表凡已重生之物；而此处经上的措辞不同：“这就可作为我与地立约的记号了”。从这里，并从“立约的记号”这句话的重复明显可知，此处表示不同的事物。事实上，“地”表凡不重生和无法重生之物，也就是人自我中心的意愿部分。<br />当人重生后，就其心智的觉知部分而言，他属于主，但就其心智的意愿部分而言，他属于他自己。这两个部分在属灵之人里面是彼此对立的。不过，尽管人自我中心的意愿部分是对立的，但它的持续存在仍是不可避免的。事实上，觉知中的一切昏暗，即云层的一切厚度皆源于此。它不断从那里流入，并且随着它的流注，其觉知部分中的云层变厚；不过，随着它被移走，这云层变薄。这就是为何“地”在此表人的自我中心。前面已说明，“地”表人的身体部分，也表很多其它事物。<br />意愿和觉知之间的关系就象这样的两个部分：它们先通过友谊的盟约结合在一起（如上古教会成员的意愿和觉知的情形），然后友谊破裂，敌意产生，如人完全败坏他的意愿部分时所发生的情况；之后，当重新立约时，敌对部分呈现出来，仿佛圣约与它同在，但圣约不是与它立的，因为它是完全对立和相反的，圣约是与从它那里所流入之物立的（如前所述），即与自我中心的觉知部分立的。立约的标志或记号乃是这样：主在自我中心的觉知部分临在的程度，就是它的意愿部分被移除的程度。这二者的关系恰似天堂和地狱。重生之人的觉知部分凭着主所临在的仁爱而成为天堂，而他的意愿部分则是地狱。主在这天堂临在的程度，就是这地狱被移除的程度。因为人靠自己存活，就是在地狱，而靠主存活，则在天堂。人不断从地狱被提升天堂，并且他被提升到什么程度，其地狱就被移除到什么程度。所以，主临在的记号或标志在于人自己的意愿部分正在被移除。这种移除只有藉着试探和很多其它重生的手段才有可能实现。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1044.</strong> And it will serve as a sign of the pact between me and the earth means an indication of the Lord's presence in charity, and the earth here means human selfhood, as statements above show [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1044/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1036" target=_top>1036</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1044/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038" target=_top>1038</a>]. The symbolism of the earth as human selfhood can be seen from the inner meaning, too, and also from the sequence of thoughts. Earlier the text said, "This is the sign of the pact between me and you and every living soul that is with you," which symbolizes whatever has been reborn. Here, however, the phrasing changes: "It will serve as a sign of the pact between me and the earth." The change — and the repetition of the sign of the pact as well — shows that the present verse has another meaning. It shows, in fact, that the earth is that which has not been reborn and cannot be reborn, and this is human self-will.<br />[2] So far as their intellectual side goes, regenerate people are the Lord's, but so far as their voluntary side goes, they are their own. These two sides in a spiritual person are opposed to each other, but although a person's voluntary part is opposed, its presence is still unavoidable. All the darkness in spiritual people's intellectual part, all the thickening of their cloud, comes from the will side. The darkness constantly streams in from their will side, and the more it does, the more the cloud in their intellectual part thickens. On the other hand, the more the darkness withdraws, the more the cloud thins. That is the reason the earth in this case symbolizes human selfhood. (It was shown earlier that the earth symbolizes our bodily concerns and much else besides [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1044/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_16" target=_top>16</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1044/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_17" target=_top>17</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1044/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_28" target=_top>28</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1044/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_29" target=_top>29</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1044/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_82" target=_top>82</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1044/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566" target=_top>566</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1044/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_620" target=_top>620</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1044/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_662" target=_top>662</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1044/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_800" target=_top>800</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1044/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_895" target=_top>895</a>].)<br />[3] The situation resembles that of two people who were once bound together in a pact of friendship, as will and intellect were among the people of the earliest church. When the friendship breaks down and enmity arises — as it did when humanity completely perverted its power of will — and a new pact is entered into, the hostile party then takes center stage, as if it were the party with which the pact had been struck. The pact is not with this side of our mind, however (since it is diametrically opposed and contrary), but with what streams from it, as noted earlier [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1044/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1023" target=_top>1023</a>] — with intellectual selfhood, that is. The sign or indication of the pact is this: the larger the Lord's presence in our intellectual selfhood, the more remote our self-will.<br />The case is just like that of heaven and hell. A regenerate person's intellectual half is heaven because of the charity in which the Lord is present. But such a person's will side is hell. The more present the Lord is in heaven, the more hell moves away. When we depend on ourselves, we are in hell. When we depend on the Lord, we are in heaven and are always being lifted up from hell into heaven. The higher we rise, the greater the distance between us and our hell.<br />The sign or indication that the Lord is present, then, is the withdrawal of our own will. Times of trial and many other means of regeneration work to distance it. </p>

And it shall be for a sign of a covenant between Me and the earth. That this signifies a sign of the presence of the Lord in charity, and that the "earth" here denotes the Own of man, is evident from 
what has been already said. That the "earth" signifies the Own of man, is evident also from the internal sense and from the connection in which it here occurs. For it was said before: "this is the sign 
of the covenant which I make between Me and you and every living soul that is with you" by which was signified whatever has been regenerated. But here it is said, differently: "it shall be for a sign 
of a covenant between Me and the earth." From this, and also from the repetition of the words "sign of a covenant" it is plain that here something else is signified, and in fact that the "earth" means 
that which is not and cannot be regenerated, which is the Own of man's will part.  [2] For man when regenerated is as to the intellectual part the Lord's, but as to his will part is his own, these 
two parts in the spiritual man being opposed. But though the will part of man is opposed, yet it cannot but be present; for all the obscurity in his intellectual part, or all the density of his cloud, 
is from it. It continually flows in from it, and in proportion as it flows in, the cloud in his intellectual part is thickened; but in proportion as it is removed, the cloud is made thin. Thus it is 
that by the "earth" is here signified the Own of man. (That by the "earth" is signified the corporeal part of man, as well as many other things, has been shown before.)  [3] This condition of things 
between the will and the understanding is as if two who were formerly conjoined by a covenant of friendship, as were the will and the understanding in the man of the Most Ancient Church, had their friendship 
broken, and enmity had arisen-as took place when man wholly corrupted his will part-and then when a covenant is again entered into, the hostile part is set forth as if the covenant were with 
it, but it is not with it, because it is utterly opposite and contrary, but it is with that which flows in from it-as already said-that is, with the Own of the understanding. The "token" or "sign" of 
the covenant is this, that in proportion as there is the presence of the Lord in the Own of the understanding, in the same proportion the Own of the will will be removed. The case herein is exactly as 
it is with heaven and hell. The intellectual part of the regenerated man, from charity, in which the Lord is present, is heaven; his will part is hell. So far as the Lord is present in this heaven, 
so far is this hell removed. For of himself man is in hell, and of the Lord is in heaven. And man is being continually uplifted from hell into heaven, and so far as he is uplifted, so far his hell is 
removed. The "sign" therefore, or indication, that the Lord is present, is that man's will part is being removed. The possibility of its removal is effected by means of temptations, and by many other 
means of regeneration. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1044</b></p><p><b>1044.</b>
'And it will be for a sign of the covenant between Me and the earth' means a token of the Lord's presence in charity, 'the earth' here being a person's proprium. This is clear from what has been stated 
already. That 'the earth' means a person's Proprium is clear from the internal sense and from the whole train of thought. Above it was stated that 'this is the sign of the covenant between Me and you 
and every living soul that is with you' meant whatever has been regenerated; but here the wording is different - 'it will be for a sign of the covenant between Me and the earth'. From this, and also 
from the repetition of 'sign of the covenant', it is evident that something different is meant here, and indeed that 'the earth' is that which has not been regenerated, and which is incapable of being, 
namely the will part of a person's proprium. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 When somebody is regenerate he belongs to the Lord so far as the understanding Part of his mind is concerned but belongs to himself so far as the 
will part of it is concerned. These two parts in the spiritual man are opposed to each other. But although the will part of a person's proprium is opposed, its continuing presence is nevertheless inevitable. 
Indeed all the obscurity in the understanding part, that is, all the thickness of his cloud, originates there. It is constantly flowing in from there, and in the measure it flows in so the cloud 
in the understanding part thickens; but in the measure it is taken away, the cloud thins out. This is why 'the earth' here means a person's proprium. That 'the earth' means the bodily part of man's 
nature as well as having many other meanings has been shown already. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The relationship between those two parts is like two parties who were first of all joined together by a covenant of friendship 
- as will and understanding were in the member of the Most Ancient Church - and then the friendship was broken off and hostility arose, as happened when man corrupted totally the will part of him. 
After that, when the covenant is renewed, the hostile part presents itself as though the covenant were with it. But no covenant is made with it because it is utterly opposed and contrary. It is made 
instead with that which flows in from it, as has been stated, that is, with the understanding part of the proprium. The sign or token of the covenant is this, that to the extent the Lord is present 
in the understanding part of the proprium the will part of it will be taken away. The relationship between the two is just like that of heaven and hell. The understanding part of a regenerate person, 
by virtue of the charity in which the Lord is present, is heaven, while the will part of him is hell. To the extent the Lord is present in heaven, hell is removed; for when he subsists from himself man 
is in hell, but when he does so from the Lord he is in heaven. Man is constantly being raised up from hell into heaven, and so far as he is raised up his hell is taken away from him. The sign or token 
therefore that the Lord is present rests in the fact that man's own will is taken away. The possibility of that removal is achieved by means of temptations and many other means of regeneration. </p>

'Et erit in signum foederis inter Me et inter terram quod significet indicium praesentiae Domini in charitate, et quo 'terra' hic sit proprium hominis, constat ab illis quae prius dicta sunt et quod 
'terra' significet proprium hominis, constat ex sensu interno ipsaque serie rerum; prius enim dictum 'hoc signum foederis inter Me et inter vos, et inter omnem animam vivam, quae vobiscum quibus significatum 
quicquid regeneratum est; hic autem aliter, 'erit in signum foederis inter Me et inter terram,' inde, ut et ex repetitione 'signi foederis,' patet quod hic significetur aliud, et quidem quod 
'terra' id quod non regeneratum est et quod non regenerari potest, [2] quod est proprium voluntarium hominis.  Homo enim regeneratus quoad partem intellectualem est Domini, sed quoad partem voluntariam 
suam est sui, quae binae partes in homine spirituali sunt oppositae; sed pars voluntaria hominis tametsi opposita est, usque tamen non potest non adesse; omne enim obscurum in parte ejus intellectuali, 
seu omnis densitas ejus nubis, est inde, continue inde influit, et quantum influit tantum densatur nubes in parte intellectuali, at quantam removetur tantum attenuatur nubes; inde est quod per 'terram' 
hic significetur proprium hominis; quod per terram significetur corporeum hominis praeter multa alia, prius ostensum est: [3] se habet hoc sicut bini qui prius amicitiae foedere conjuncti sunt, 
ut fuit voluntas et intellectus apud hominem Antiquissimae Ecclesiae; cum amicitia rupta, et inimicitia orta, ut factum cum homo corrupit prorsus voluntarium suum, cum iterum foedus initur, tunc sistitur 
pars inimica coram sicut cum ea foedus, sed non est foedus cura ea quia prorsus opposita et contraria, sed cum illo quod inde influit, ut dictum, hoc est, cum proprio intellectuali; signum seu indicium 
foederis hoc est, ut quantum praesentiae Domini in proprio intellectuali tantum removebitur proprium voluntarium; se habent haec prorsus sicut caelum et infernum; hominis regenerati pars intellectualis, 
ex charitate in qua Dominus est praesens, est caelum, ejus pars voluntaria est infernum; quantum Dominus est praesens in caelo, tantum removetur infernum; ex se enim homo est in inferno, ex Domino 
est in caelo, et continue homo elevatur ab inferno in caelum, et quantum elevatur tantum removetur ejus infernum: signum ergo seu indicium quod Dominus sit praesens, est quod voluntarium hominis 
removeatur, quod ut removeri possit, fit per tentationes, et per plura alia media regenerationis. </p>
