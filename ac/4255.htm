<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4255节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4255.</strong>“我先前只拿着我的杖过这约旦河，如今我却成了两营了”表祂从拥有极少到现在拥有很多。这从“杖”、“约旦河”和“两营”的含义清楚可知：“杖”是指能力，论及真理（参看<a href="4013.htm">4013</a>，<a href="4015.htm">4015</a>节）；“约旦河”是指引入对良善与真理的认知，如下文所述；“两营”是指良善与真理（参看<a href="4250.htm">4250</a>节），因为两营在此是指人口和羊群、牛群、骆驼，他将这些分成两组。由此可见，这些话在近似意义上表示什么，即当被引入认知时，雅各所代表的祂只有极少量的真理，后来拥有大量真理与良善；或也可说，祂从拥有极少到现在拥有很多。从目前所给出的解释明显可知，就内义而言，所论述的主题一直是主，即祂如何使自己里面的人身变成神性，并且这一过程是照着次序逐渐进行的。因此，主题一直是祂向着聪明和智慧的发展，最终向着神性聪明和智慧的发展。这一切表明“从拥有极少到拥有很多”这句话是什么意思。<br />“约旦河”之所以表示引入对良善与真理的认知，是因为约旦河是迦南地的一个边界。迦南地的所有边界都表示主国度中首先和末后的事物，以及教会中首先和末后的事物，因而表示构成主国度及其教会的属天和属灵之物里面首先和末后的事物（参看<a href="1585.htm">1585</a>，<a href="1866.htm">1866</a>，<a href="4116.htm">4116</a>，<a href="4240.htm">4240</a>节）。因此，约旦河因是一个边界，故表示引入对良善与真理的认知，因为这些认知首先到来；但当人最终变成一个教会，或主的国度时，它们就成了末后的。<br />“约旦河”表示首先的事物和末后的事物，这一点从圣言中的其它经文明显看出来，如诗篇：<br />我的神啊，我的灵魂在我里面下拜，所以我从约旦地、从黑门岭、从米萨山记念你。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗42.6.htm">42:6</a>）<br />“从约旦地记念”表示出于末后之物、因而出于谦卑如此行。<br />犹大为祂的圣所，以色列为祂所统治的；沧海看见它就奔逃，约旦河也倒流。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗114.2.htm">114:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗114.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗114.5.htm">5</a>）<br />“犹大”表示属天之爱的良善，“以色列”表示属灵之爱的良善（<a href="3654.htm">3654</a>节）；“海”表示对真理的认知（28节）；“约旦河”表示对良善的认知，当爱之良善掌权时，经上就说这些认知“倒流”，因为在这种情况下，根据前面频繁所述，是从这良善来看待认知，而不是从这些认知来看待良善，<br />士师记：<br />基列人安居在约旦河外。但人为何惧怕在船只？（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士5.17.htm">5:17</a>）<br />“基列人”表示感官良善或乐趣，人首先通过这些良善或乐趣被引入他的重生之路（<a href="4117.htm">4117</a>，<a href="4124.htm">4124</a>节）；“安居在约旦河外”表示那些用来引入的事物，因而表示教会和主国度中首先和末后的事物。这些用来引入的事物还由以色列人进入迦南地时的约旦河（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书3.14.htm">3:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/书3.17.htm">17</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/书4.1.htm">4:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/书4.24.htm">24</a>）来代表。因为“迦南地”代表主的国度（<a href="1413.htm">1413</a>，<a href="1437.htm">1437</a>，<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="3038.htm">3038</a>，<a href="3481.htm">3481</a>，<a href="3686.htm">3686</a>，<a href="3705.htm">3705</a>节）。约旦河被分开，他们从干地穿过，表示邪恶与虚假的移除，以及那些处于良善与真理的人被准许进入主的国度。以利亚升天时将约旦河水分开 （列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下2.8.htm">2:8</a>）；以及以利沙接替以利亚担当先知角色时将约旦河水分开（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下2.14.htm">2:14</a>），意思也一样。<br />乃缦照以利沙的吩咐，在约旦河中沐浴七次使他的大麻风得医治（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下5.1.htm">5:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下5.14.htm">14</a>），这种医治就代表洗礼；因为洗礼表示引入教会和那些属于教会的事物，因而表示引入重生和属于重生的事物。并不是说谁都能通过洗礼得到重生，而是说这是他应当记住的重生的标志。由于洗礼表示教会的事物，而约旦河与洗礼所表相同，如前所述，故百姓在约旦河受约翰的洗（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太3.6.htm">3:6</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可1.5.htm">1:5</a>）。主也愿意在约旦河受约翰的洗（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太3.13.htm">3:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太3.17.htm">17</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可1.9.htm">1:9</a>）。<br />约旦河表示主国度和教会中首先和末后的事物，如对良善与真理的认知，因为这些有助于将人引入祂的国度和教会，因此，约旦河也作为新地或圣地的边界被提及（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.18.htm">47:18</a>）。新地或圣地表示主的国度，以及新教会，也就是主在地上的国度（参看<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>e，<a href="3355.htm">3355</a>e节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4255</b></p><p><b>4255.</b>
For in my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am in two camps. That this signifies that from little there was much, is evident from the signification of a "staff," as being power, and as being 
predicated of truth (see n. 4013, 4015); from the signification of "Jordan," as being initiation into the knowledges of good and truth, concerning which in what follows; and from the signification of 
"two camps," as being goods and truths (see above, n. 4250); for the two camps here are the people, the flock, the herd, and the camels, which he halved. From this it is evident what is signified by 
these words in the proximate sense, namely, that he who is represented by Jacob had but little truth when he was being initiated into knowledges, and that he afterwards had many truths and goods; or what 
is the same, that from little he had much. From the explications already given, it is manifest that in the internal sense the subject treated of has been the Lord, how He made the human in Himself 
Divine-and this by successive steps according to order-and thus His progress into intelligence and wisdom, and at last into what was Divine. From this is manifest what is meant by "from little to much." 
[2] That the "Jordan" denotes initiation into the knowledges of good and truth, is because it was a boundary of the land of Canaan. That all the boundaries of that land signified things that are first 
and last of the Lord's kingdom, and those also that are first and last of His church, and thus those that are first and last of the celestial and spiritual things which constitute His kingdom and 
His church, may be seen above (n. 1585, 1866, 4116, 4240). Hence the Jordan, because it was a boundary, signified initiation into the knowledges of good and truth, for these are first; and at last, when 
the man becomes a church, or a kingdom of the Lord, they become last.  [3] That the "Jordan" signifies these things is also evident from other passages in the Word, as in David: </p>
<p>     O my God, my 
soul is bowed down upon me, therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan and of the Hermons, from the mountain of littleness (Ps. 42:6); </p>
<p>"to remember from the land of Jordan" denotes from 
what is last, thus from what is low. Again: </p>
<p>     Judah became His sanctuary, Israel His dominion; the sea saw it and fled, Jordan turned itself away backwards (Ps. 114:2-3, 5); </p>
<p>where "Judah" denotes 
the good of celestial love, and "Israel" the good of spiritual love (n. 3654); the "sea" denotes the knowledges of truth (n. 28); "Jordan" the knowledges of good, which are said to "turn themselves 
backwards" when the good of love obtains the dominion; for then knowledges are regarded from this good, but not good from them-according to what has been often shown above.  [4] In the book of Judges: 
      Gilead dwelleth in the passage of the Jordan; and Dan, why shall he fear ships? (Judg. 5:17); </p>
<p>"Gilead" denotes sensuous good, or pleasure, by which man is first initiated when being regenerated 
(n. 4117, 4124); "to dwell in the passage of the Jordan" denotes in those things which are for initiation, and which are thus the first and the last of the church and kingdom of the Lord. These were 
also represented by the Jordan when the sons of Israel entered into the land of Canaan (Josh. 3:14-17; 4:1-24). For by the land of Canaan was represented the kingdom of the Lord (n. 1413, 1437, 1607, 
3038, 3481, 3686, 3705). And by the Jordan's being divided, and their passing over on dry ground, was signified the removal of evils and falsities, and the admission of those who are in goods and truths. 
Similar is the meaning of the waters of the Jordan being divided by Elijah when he was taken up into heaven (2 Kings 2:8); and by Elisha when he entered upon the prophetic office in Elijah's place 
(2 Kings 2:14).  [5] Naaman's being healed of his leprosy by washing himself seven times in the Jordan according to the command of Elisha (2 Kings 5:1-14), represented baptism; for baptism signifies 
initiation into the church and into those things which are of the church; thus regeneration and the things of regeneration. Not that anyone is regenerated by baptism, but that this is the sign of 
it, which he should remember. And as the things of the church are signified by baptism, and the same by the Jordan, as stated above, the people were therefore baptized in the Jordan by John (Matt. 3:6; 
Mark 1:5). And the Lord also willed to be Himself baptized in it by John (Matt. 3:13-17; Mark 1:9).  [6] Because the Jordan signifies the things which are first and last of the Lord's kingdom and church, 
such as the knowledges of good and truth (for by these man is introduced), the Jordan is also mentioned as a boundary of the New Earth or Holy Land, in Ezekiel 47:18. That the New Earth or Holy 
Land is the Lord's kingdom, and also the New Church, which is the Lord's kingdom on the earth, may be seen above (n. 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118e, 3355e). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4255</b></p><p><b>4255.</b>
'For with just my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I have become two camps' means that from having little He now had much. This is clear from the meaning of 'a staff' as power - a word used in 
reference to truth, and dealt with in <a href="4013.htm">4013</a>, <a href="4015.htm">4015</a>; from the meaning of 'Jordan' as introduction into cognitions of good and truth, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'two camps' as goods and truths, 
as above in <a href="4250.htm">4250</a> - the two camps referred to here consisting of the people, flocks, herds, and camels, which he split into two groups. From this one may see what these words mean in the proximate 
sense - that when being introduced into cognitions He had only a small amount of truth but subsequently He had many truths and goods; or what amounts to the same, from having little He now had much. 
From the explanations given up to now it is evident that the subject in the internal sense has been the way in which the Lord made the Human within Him Divine, doing so step by step in keeping with 
order. So the subject has been His advance into intelligence and wisdom, at length into Divine intelligence and wisdom. This shows what the phrase 'from having little He now had much' is used to mean. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
The reason 'the Jordan' means introduction into cognitions of good and truth is that it was a boundary to the land of Canaan. For all the boundaries of that land meant things that are first and 
last in the Lord's kingdom, and also those that are first and last in the Church, and so those that are first and last in the celestial and spiritual things which constitute the Lord's kingdom and His 
Church, see <a href="1585.htm">1585</a>, <a href="1866.htm">1866</a>, <a href="4116.htm">4116</a>, <a href="4240.htm">4240</a>. Therefore, being a boundary, 'the Jordan' meant introduction into cognitions of good and truth, for these come first; but when at length a person becomes in himself 
a Church or the Lord's kingdom they come to be last. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That 'the Jordan' means things that are first and those that are last may be seen from other places in the Word, as in David, </p>
<blockquote>
O my God, 
my soul bows itself down within me;<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> therefore I remember You from the fund of Jordan, and the Hermons from the little mountain. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2042:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 42:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Remembering from the land of Jordan' stands for doing so 
from what is last and so from a position of humbleness. In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
Judah became His sanctuary, Israel His dominions. The sea saw and fled; the Jordan turned about backwards. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20114:2,%203,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 114:2, 3, 5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Judah' stands for the good of celestial love, and 'Israel' for the good of spiritual love, <a href="3654.htm">3654</a>. 'The sea' stands for cognitions of truth, <a href="28.htm">28</a>, 'the Jordan' stands for cognitions of good which 
are said 'to turn about backwards' when the good of love gains dominion, for in that case cognitions are viewed from that good, not the good from those cognitions - in accordance with the things that 
have often been shown already. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the Book of Judges, </p>
<blockquote>
Gilead dwelling at the crossing of the Jordan; and Dan, why will he fear ships? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%205:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 5:17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Gilead' stands for the sensory good or 
pleasure by means of which a person is first introduced into the path of his regeneration, <a href="4117.htm">4117</a>, <a href="4124.htm">4124</a>. 'Dwelling at the crossing of the Jordan' stands for the things effecting that introduction, and so 
things that are first and last in the Church and the Lord's kingdom. These introductory things were also represented by 'the Jordan' when the children of Israel entered the land of Canaan <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%203:14-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 3:14-end</a>; 
4:1-end; for 'the land of Canaan' represented the Lord's kingdom, <a href="1413.htm">1413</a>, <a href="1437.htm">1437</a>, <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>, <a href="3038.htm">3038</a>, <a href="3481.htm">3481</a>, <a href="3686.htm">3686</a>, <a href="3705.htm">3705</a>. And the dividing of the Jordan and their passing through on dry ground meant the removal 
of evils and falsities and the admission into the Lord's kingdom of those who are governed by goods and truths. Similar in meaning is the dividing of the waters of the Jordan by Elijah when he was carried 
up into heaven, <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 2:8, and by Elisha when he entered in place of Elijah into the prophetic role, <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 2:14. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 The cure of Naaman's leprosy, effected by his having washed himself seven 
times in the Jordan according to Elisha's command, <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 5:1-14, represented baptism, for baptism means introduction into the Church and into the things that belong to the Church, and so into regeneration 
and the things that belong to regeneration. Not that anyone is regenerated by baptism; rather it is the sign of it, which he should call to mind. And because the things which constitute the 
Church are meant by baptism, and baptism is meant by 'the Jordan', as mentioned above, it was the Jordan therefore in which people were baptized by John, Matt. 3:6; Mark 1:5. And the Lord too was willing 
to be baptized in it by John, Matt. 3:13-17; Mark 1:9. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 Because 'the Jordan' means things that are first and last in the Lord's kingdom and in the Church - such as the cognitions of good and 
truth, since these serve to introduce a person into His kingdom and Church - the Jordan is also for that reason referred to as a boundary of the new earth or holy land, in Ezekiel 47:18. The new earth 
or holy land means the Lord's kingdom and also the new Church which is the Lord's kingdom on earth, see <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="1850.htm">1850</a>, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>, <a href="2118.htm">2118</a> (end), <a href="3355.htm">3355</a> (end).

`Quia in baculo meo transivi Jordanem hunc, et nunc sum in duo castra': quod significet quod ab exiguo multum, constat a significatione `baculi' quod sit potentia et quod praedicetur de vero, de 
qua n. 4013, 4015; a significatione `Jordanis' quod sit initiatio in cognitiones boni et veri, de qua sequitur; et a significatione `duorum castrorum quod sint bona et vera, ut supra n. 4250, nam duo 
castra hic sunt populus, grex, armentum, et cameli, quae dimidiavit; inde patet quid per illa verba in sensu proximo significatur, quod nempe paucum veri ipsi esset cum initiaretur in cognitiones, 
et quod dein multa vera et bona, seu quod idem, quod ab exiguo multum; ex illis quae hactenus explicata sunt, patet quod actum sit in sensu interna de Domino quomodo Ipse Humanum in Se Divinum fecit, 
et hoc successive {1} secundum ordinem; ita de progressu in intelligentiam et sapientiam, tandem in Divinam; inde patet quid per ab exiguo ad multum intelligitur.  [2] Quod `Jordanes' sit initiatio 
in cognitiones boni et veri, est inde quia erat terminus terrae Canaanis; quod omnes termini illius terrae significaverint illa quae prima (c)et ultima sunt regni Domini, tum quae prima (c)et 
ultima sunt Ecclesiae, ita quae prima et ultima sunt caelestium et spiritualium quae regnum Domini et Ecclesiam Ipsius constituunt, videatur n. 1585, 1866, 4116, 4240; </p>
<p>inde `Jordanes' quia erat terminus, 
significabat initiationem in cognitiones boni et veri, nam hae sunt prima, et tandem cum homo fit Ecclesia seu regnum Domini, fiunt ultima.  [3] Quod `Jordanes' illa significet, etiam ab aliis 
locis in Verbo constare potest, ut apud Davidem,           Deus mi, super me anima mea incurvat se, propterea      recordabor Tui e terra Jordanis, et Hermonim e monte      exiguitatis, Ps xlii 
7 [A V. 6]; </p>

<p>`Jehudah' pro bono amoris caelestis, et `Israel' pro bono amoris spiritualis, n. 3654, `mare' pro cognitionibus veri, n. 28; </p>
<p>`Jordanes' pro cognitionibus 
boni, quae dicuntur `se vertere retrorsum' quando bonum amoris dominium obtinet, nam tunc cognitiones a bono illo {4} spectantur, non autem bonum ab illis, secundum ea quae saepius prius ostensa 
sunt: in Libro Judicum,           Gilead in transitu Jordanis habitans, et Dan cur  timebit naves? v 17; </p>

filii Israelis in terram Canaanem, Jos. iii 14 ad fin.; iv 1 ad fin.; nam per `terram Canaanem' repraesentatum fuit regnum Domini, n. 1413, 1437, 1607, 3038, 3481, 3705, 3686; et [per] quod `divisus 
esset Jordanes, et illi in sicco transirent' significata est remotio malorum et falsorum, (c)ac admissio illorum qui in bonis et veris [sunt]; similiter quod `Jordanis aquae divisae sint ab Elia 
cum ille sublatus est in caelum, Reg. ii 8, et ab Elisha cum is loco Eliae intraret munus propheticum, ibid. vers. 14.  [5] Quod Naaman sanatus sit ex lepra, per quod lavisset se septem vicibus in 
Jordane, secundum mandatum Elishae, 2 Reg. v 1-14, repraesentabat baptismum, nam baptismus significat initiationem in Ecclesiam et in illa quae sunt Ecclesiae, ita regenerationem et quae regenerationis 
sunt; non quod per baptismum aliquis regeneretur, sed quod signum ejus sit cujus recordetur; et quia illa {5} quae sunt Ecclesiae, significantur {6} per baptismum, ac simile per `Jordanem,' ut
