Verse 18. And the sons of Noah, that went forth from the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth; and Ham is the father of Canaan. "The sons of Noah, that went forth from the ark" signify those who constituted 
the Ancient Church; "that went forth from the ark" signifies those who are regenerate; "Shem" signifies the internal church; "Ham" signifies the church corrupted; "Japheth" signifies the external 
church; "and Ham is the father of Canaan" signifies that from the corrupted church sprang worship in externals without internals, which worship is signified by "Canaan." </p>

Verse 18 And Noah's sons who went out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And Ham was the father of Canaan.  </p>
<p>'Noah's sons who went out of the ark' means those who constituted the Ancient Church, 
'who went out of the ark' meaning those who had been regenerated. 'Shem' means the internal Church, 'Ham' the corrupted Church, 'Japheth' the external Church. 'Ham was the father of Canaan means that 
from the corrupted Church arose worship in external things devoid of internal, which worship is meant by Canaan.  </p>

Vers. 18.  Et fuerunt filii Noahi egressi ex arca, Shem, et Ham, et Japheth, et Ham is pater Canaanis. 'Fuerunt filii Noahi egressi ex arca' significant illos qui constituerunt Ecclesiam Antiquam; 'egressi 
ex arca' significant qui regenerati: 'Shem' significat Ecclesiam internam: 'Ham' significat Ecclesiam corruptam: 'Japheth' significat Ecclesiam externam: 'Ham is pater Canaanis' significat quod 
ex Ecclesia corrupta ortus sit cultus in externis absque internis, qui significatur per 'Canaan.' </p>
