Verses 31-35. And the flax and the barley were smitten; for the barley was a ripening ear, and the flax was a stalk. And the wheat and the spelt were not smitten, because they were hidden. And Moses 
went out of the city from before Pharaoh, and spread out his palms unto Jehovah; and the voices and the hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth. And Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail 
and the voices had ceased, and he sinned yet more, and made heavy his heart, he and his servants. And the heart of Pharaoh was made firm, and he did not let the sons of Israel go, as Jehovah had spoken 
by the hand of Moses. "And the flax," signifies the truth of the exterior natural; "and the barley," signifies its good; "were smitten," signifies that they were destroyed; "for the barley was a 
ripening ear, and the flax was a stalk," signifies that this good and truth stood forth and looked downward; "and the wheat and the spelt," signifies the good of the interior natural and its truth; "were 
not smitten," signifies that they were not destroyed; "because they were hidden," signifies because they did not stand forth, and because they tended inward; "and Moses went out of the city from 
before Pharaoh," signifies separation from them; "and spread out his palms unto Jehovah," signifies intercession; "and the voices and the hail ceased," signifies that there was an end of this state; "and 
the rain was not poured upon the earth," signifies that these falsities no more appeared; "and Pharaoh saw," signifies a noticing; "that the rain and the hail and the voices had ceased," signifies 
that there was an end of this state; "and he sinned yet more," signifies as yet a withdrawal; "and made heavy his heart, he and his servants," signifies obstinacy; "and the heart of Pharaoh was made 
firm," signifies that from evil they were determined; "and he did not let the sons of Israel go," signifies that they did not leave them; "as Jehovah had spoken," signifies according to the prediction; 
"by the hand of Moses," signifies by means of the law from the Divine. </p>

<p>'And the flax' means the truth of the exterior natural. 'And the barley' means its good. 'Were struck' means that they were destroyed. 'For the barley was a ripening 
ear, and the flax a stem' means that that good and truth were conspicuous and looked downwards. 'And the wheat and the spelt' means the good of the interior natural and its truth. 'Were not struck' 
means that they were not destroyed. 'For they were hidden' means because they were not conspicuous and because they turned in an inward direction. 'And Moses went out from Pharaoh, from the city' 
means a separation from them. 'And spread out his palms towards Jehovah' means intercession. 'And the voices and the hail ceased' means the end of that state. 'And the rain was not poured on the earth' 
means that those falsities no longer made their appearance. 'And Pharaoh saw' means a discernment. 'That the rain and the hail and the voices had ceased' means that it was the end of that state. 'And 
he continued to sin' means a departure still further away. 'And made his heart stubborn, he and his servants' means obstinacy. 'And Pharaoh's heart was made unyielding' means that evil was the cause 
of their obstinate behaviour. 'And he did not send the children of Israel away' means so that they did not leave. 'As Jehovah had spoken' means as accorded with what had been foretold. 'Through the 
hand of Moses' means by means of the law from God.

Vers. 31 ad fin.  Et linum et hordeum percussum est, quia hordeum spica maturescens, et linum culmus.  Et triticum et zea non percussa sunt, quia abdita illa.  Et egressus Moscheh a cum Pharaone, urbe, 
et expandit palmas suas ad Jehovam, et cessaverunt voces et grando, et pluvia non effusa est terram.  Et vidit Pharao quod cessavit pluvia, et grando, et voces, et addidit peccare; et aggravavit cor 
suum, ille et servi illius.  Et obfirmatum cor Pharaonis, et non dimisit filios Israelis, quemadmodum locutus Jehovah per manum Moschis.  `Et linum' significat verum naturalis exterioris: `et hordeum' 
significat bonum ejus: `percussum est' significat quod destructa: `quia hordeum spica maturescens, et linum culmus' significat quod bonum et verum illud exstarent et spectarent deorsum: `et triticum 
et zea' significat bonum interioris naturalis et verum ejus: `non percussa sunt' significat quod non destructa sint: `quia abdita illa' significat quia non exstarent, et quia vergerent introrsum: `et 
egressus Moscheh a cum Pharaone, urbe' significat separationem ab illis: `et expandit palmas suas ad Jehovam' significat intercessionem: `et cessaverunt voces et grando' significat quod finis illius 
status: `et pluvia non effusa terram' significat quod falsa illa non magis apparerent: `et vidit Pharao' significat apperceptionem: `quod cessavit pluvia, et grando, et voces' significat quod finis 
esset status illius: `et addidit peccare' significat recessionem adhuc: `et aggravavit cor suum, ille et servi illius' significat obstinationem: `et obfirmatum cor Pharaonis' significat quod ex malo obstinarent 
se: `et non dimisit filios Israelis' significat {1}ut non relinquerent: `quemadmodum locutus Jehovah' significat secundum praedictionem: per manum Moschis' significat media lege a Divino. {2} 	@1
