<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8878节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8878.</strong>“恨我的”表那些彻底弃绝主的神性之人。这从“恨神的人”的含义清楚可知，“恨神的人”是指那些陷入邪恶并由此陷入虚假的人。因为他们就是那些弃绝主的神性之人；他们陷入邪恶并由此陷入虚假到何等程度，就在何等程度上不仅弃绝它，而且还憎恨它。他们所弃绝的，之所以是主的神性，是因为那些陷入邪恶的人不是在天堂之光，而是在属世之光中看事物，最终只在来自肉体的感官之光中看事物。他们凭这种低劣之光，绝无可能看见主的人身，只会视之为人。他们无法认识到何为神性人身，因为对于神性，他们有一种完全空洞且毫无意义的概念。如果他们被告知，神性本身就是神性之爱，神性之爱就是一切生命的本质存在，主凭祂的成孕而为这爱，这爱因此是祂生命的至内在存在或本质存在，也就是耶和华；如果他们被告知，祂荣耀了祂的人身，使之变成祂的样式，也就是使它变成神性，那么他们当中那些被赋予某种洞察力的人的确能在某种程度上理解这一切。即便如此，他们仍不相信；因为当从他们在其中看见事物的理智之光降到他们自己的属世和感官之光时，他们就在这个真理上陷入完全和纯粹的黑暗，并由此陷入对它的否认。</p>

Of them that hate Me. That this signifies who absolutely reject the Divine of the Lord, is evident from the signification of "them that hate God," as being those who are in evil and thence in falsity, 
for these are they who reject the Divine of the Lord; and so far as they are in evil and thence in falsity, so far they not only reject it, but also hold it in hatred. That it is the Divine of the Lord 
which they reject, is because they who are in evil are not in heavenly light, but in natural light, and finally are in sensuous light which is from the corporeal. From this light they cannot possibly 
see the Human of the Lord otherwise than as human, for they cannot perceive what the Divine Human is, because they have an idea about the Divine that is utterly empty and worthless. If they are told 
that the Divine Itself is Divine love, that the Divine love is the being of all life, and that from conception the Lord was this love, which was thus the inmost being of His life, thus was Jehovah, 
and that He glorified His Human to the likeness of this, that is, made it Divine, all this may indeed be in some measure apprehended by those who are endowed with some intellectual penetration; but still 
they do not believe it, for when they descend from the intellectual light in which they then are, into their own natural and sensuous light, they fall into mere thick darkness in respect to this 
truth, and from this into denial. </p>

'Of those who hate Me' means those who completely reject the Lord's Divinity. This is clear from the meaning of 'those who hate God' as those who are ruled by evil and therefore by falsity For these 
are they who reject the Lord's Divinity; and to the extent that they are ruled by evil and therefore by falsity they not merely reject but also hate it. The reason why the Lord's Divinity is what they 
reject is that those ruled by evil do not see things in heavenly light, only in natural light, and eventually only in the light of sensory awareness provided by the body. In this inferior light these 
people cannot possibly see the Lord's Human as anything more than human. They are unable to recognize what the Divine Human is, because they have an altogether empty and meaningless notion of the Divine. 
If they are told that the Divine itself is Divine Love, and that Divine Love is the Essential Being (Esse) of all life; if they are told that by virtue of His conception the Lord was that Love, which 
was thus the Essential Being of His life, that is, was Jehovah; and if they are told that He glorified, that is, made Divine, His Human to be the likeness of Him, then those of them who are endowed 
with some intellectual ability may indeed be able to some extent to grasp all this. Even so, they do not believe it; for when they pass from the intellectual light in which they are then seeing things 
into their natural and sensory light, they sink into complete and utter darkness regarding this truth, and consequently into denial of it. </p>

</p><b>8878.</b>
`Osoribus Meis': quod significet qui Divinum Domini plane rejiciunt, constat ex significatione `osorum Dei' quod sint qui in malo et inde (d)in falso sunt, nam hi sunt qui Divinum Domini rejiciunt, 
et quantum in malo sunt et inde falso, tantum non modo (o)id rejiciunt sed etiam odio habent; quod Divinum Domini sit quod rejiciunt, est quia illi qui in malo sunt non in luce caelesti sunt sed in luce 
naturali et tandem in luce sensuali quae ex corporeo; hi ex eo lumine nequicquam videre possunt Humanum Domini aliter ac Humanum, nam non percipere possunt {1} quid Divinum Humanum, (o)quia de Divino 
prorsus vacuam et inanem ideam habent; si illis dicitur quod ipsum Divinum sit Divinus Amor, et quod Divinus Amor sit Esse omnis vitae, et quod Dominus ex conceptione fuerit ille Amor, qui sic fuit 
intimum Esse Ipsius vitae, ita Jehovah, et quod {2} ad similitudinem Ejus glorificaverit Humanum Suum, hoc est, {3} Divinum fecerit, haec quidem illi qui aliquo acumine intellectuali pollent, aliquantum 
capere possunt sed usque non credunt; nam cum {4} (c)ex intellectuali luce in qua tunc sunt delabuntur in lucem suam naturalem et sensualem, labuntur in meram caliginem de hoc vero, ac inde in negationem 
{5}. @1 i quid Divinum, ita non$ @2 i sic$ @3 et inde Hoc quoque$ @4 dum$ @5 labuntur in caliginem de veris, quae inducta est illis per mala et inde falsa, quae in illa luce habitant$ </p>
