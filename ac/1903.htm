<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1903节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1903.</strong>创世记16:3. 这样，亚伯兰在迦南地住了十年之后，亚伯兰的妻子撒莱才带来自己的埃及婢女夏甲，撒莱将她给了自己的丈夫亚伯兰为妾。<br />“亚伯兰的妻子撒莱才带来”表对真理的情感，就是真正意义上的“妻子撒莱”。“自己的埃及婢女夏甲”表外层人的生命和对知识的情感。“亚伯兰在迦南地住了十年之后”表主为自己所获得的良善及其衍生真理的余留，这理性凭这余留被孕育。“撒莱将她给了自己的丈夫亚伯兰为妾”表由对真理的情感所促成的联结。</p>

Verse 3. And Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, after ten years of Abram's dwelling in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram, her man, for a woman to him. "Sarai, Abram's 
wife, took," signifies the affection of truth, which in the genuine sense is "Sarai the wife;" "Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid," signifies the life of the exterior man, and the affection of memory-knowledges; 
"after ten years of Abram's dwelling in the land of Canaan," signifies the remains of good and of the derivative truth which the Lord procured to Himself, and by means of which that rational 
was conceived; "and gave her to Abram, her man, for a woman to him," signifies conjunction through the incitation of the affection of truth. </p>

Verse 3 And Sarai, Abram's wife (uxor), took Hagar her Egyptian servant-girl, after Abram had been dwelling ten years in the land of Canaan, and she gave her to Abram her husband (vir) as his wife (mulier). </p>
<p>'Sarai, 
Abram's wife, took' means the affection for truth, which in the genuine sense is 'Sarai the wife'. 'Hagar her Egyptian servant-girl' means the life of the exterior man and the affection 
for knowledge. 'After Abram had been dwelling ten years in the land of Canaan' means the remnants of good and of truth deriving from that good which the Lord acquired to Himself and by means of which 
this rational was conceived. 'And she gave her to Abram her husband as his wife' means a joining together prompted by the affection for truth. </p>

Vers.  3.  Et accepit Sarai uxor Abrami Hagarem Aegyptiam ancillam suam, a fine decem annorum ab habitando Abram in terra Canaan, et dedit eam Abramo viro suo, illi in mulierem {1}. `Accepit Sarai uxor 
Abrami' significat affectionem veri quae in genuino sensu est `Sarai uxor': `Hagarem Aegyptiam ancillam suam' significat vitam hominis exterioris et affectionem scientiarum: `a fine decem amorum ab 
habitando Abram in terra Canaan' significat reliquias boni et inde veri quas sibi comparavit Dominus, per quas conceptum rationale illud: `et dedit eum Abramo viro suo, illi in mulierem' significat 
conjunctionem incitante affectione veri. 	@1 A d uxorem, i mulierem.$ </p>
