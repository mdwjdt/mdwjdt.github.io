<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2196节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2196.</strong>“那人后边”表接近那时存在于理性中，并由于理性里面有人性的东西而与它分离的良善。这从以下事实清楚可知，论到撒拉所站的门口，经上说它在“那人后边”。“在那人后边”表示没有联结起来，而是在他背后。凡与某人分离之物皆由一种可以说被抛在身后的东西来代表，这从来世的代表明显可知（对此，可参看<a href="1393.htm">1393</a>，<a href="1875.htm">1875</a>节）。这种分离就是此处经上说撒拉所站的门口在“那人后边”所表达的。<br />当将祂自己与神性联结起来时，那时祂所具有的纯人性的理性真理（human rational truth）便与祂分离。关于这纯人性的理性真理，情况是这样：人性的理性真理理解不了神性事物，因为这些事物超出它的理解范畴。事实上，这种真理与属世人里面的记忆知识相通，它越通过这些记忆知识来看待在它之上的事物，就越不承认它们。因为这类真理处在它无法摆脱的表象中，这些表象由感官经验产生，而感官事物会使人误以为神性事物本身似乎也具有同样的性质。然而事实上，它们不受一切表象限制。当阐述这类神性事物时，这理性真理绝不可能相信它们，因为它无法理解。<br />例如，有人说若非拥有来自主之物，人就没有任何生命可言。这理性凭表象就会以为，在这种情况下，人似乎凭自己无法存活。而事实上，当他发觉他通过主拥有生命时，他才首次真正活着。<br />这理性凭表象以为人所行之善来自他自己；而事实上，良善丝毫不源于自我，全都源于主。<br />这理性凭表象以为人行善事时配得救恩；而事实上，人凭自己什么也不配得，一切功德都是主的。<br />人凭表象以为当他靠主从恶中退离，并被主保守在良善中时，他所具有的便只是良善、公义，甚至圣洁；而事实上，人里面只有邪恶、不义和亵渎。<br />人凭表象以为，他出于仁爱行善事时，是出于自己的意愿这样做；而事实上，这种事并非来自其意愿部分，而来自其被植入仁爱的理解力部分。<br />人凭表象以为除了世俗的荣耀之外再没有任何荣耀；而事实上，天堂的荣耀中没有一丝世俗的荣耀。<br />人凭表象以为没人能爱邻胜己，一切爱皆始于自我；而事实上，天堂之爱中没有一丝自我之爱。<br />人凭表象以为除了尘世之光之外再没有任何光；而事实上，天堂中没有一丝尘世之光，然而，这光却如此之大，以至于比世上正午之光还要明亮上千倍。<br />人凭表象以为主绝不可能作为一轮太阳在整个天堂面前闪耀；而事实上，天上的一切光皆来自祂。<br />人凭表象无法理解来世会有各种活动；而事实上，那里的人觉得自己和世人一样四处活动，如在自己的居所、庭院和花园里活动。若被告知，如此显现的这些活动只是状态的变化，他更加不能理解。<br />人凭表象无法理解在我们眼前不可见的灵人和天使能被看到；也不理解他们能与世人对话；而事实上，他们在内视，即灵的视觉面前，比世人看世人看得还要清楚；他们的声音同样清晰可闻。诸如此类的事还有成千上万，人的理性凭自己那由感官经验产生并由此变暗的光，根本不可能相信它们。事实上，处在属世事物本身中的这理性是瞎的。例如，它不能理解住在地球正对面的人如何双脚站立并行走，或不能理解其它许多自然现象。那么，这理性在属灵和属天的事物上必是何等盲目呢？这些事物远在属世事物之上。<br />由于人的理性具有这样的性质，故此处才说，当拥有神性直觉的主与神性融合时，它便被分离出去。这就是这句话，即撒拉（她在此表这理性真理）“站在那人后边的帐棚门口”所表示的。</p>

And it was behind him. That this signifies near the good in which the rational then was, and separated from it insofar as anything of the human was in it, is evident from the fact that it is said of 
the door where Sarah was that it was "behind him." To be "behind him" signifies not to be conjoined, but at his back. That which is separated from anyone is represented by a kind of rejection as it were 
to the back, as is evident from the representatives in the other life (concerning which from experience, n. 1393, 1875). This is here expressed by its being said that the door where Sarah was, was 
"behind him."  [2] As regards the merely human rational truth which was then with the Lord being separated from Him when He conjoined Himself with the Divine, the case is this. Human rational truth does 
not apprehend Divine things, because these are above the sphere of its understanding, for this truth communicates with the memory-knowledges which are in the natural man, and in so far as it looks 
from these at the things which are above itself, so far it does not acknowledge them. For this truth is in appearances, which it is not able to put off; and appearances are born from sensuous things, 
which induce a belief as if Divine things themselves also were of a like nature, when yet these are exempt from all appearances, and when they are stated, this rational truth cannot possibly believe 
them, because it cannot apprehend them.  [3] If for example it is stated that man has no life except what is from the Lord, the rational supposes from appearances that in that case man cannot live as 
of himself; whereas he for the first time truly lives when he perceives that he does so from the Lord.  [4] The rational supposes from appearances that the good which man does is from himself, and yet 
there is nothing of good from self, but all is from the Lord. [5] From appearances the rational supposes that man merits salvation when he does what is good; whereas of himself man can merit nothing, 
but all merit is the Lord's.  [6] From appearances man supposes that when he is withheld from evil and is kept in good by the Lord, there is nothing with him but what is good and just, nay, holy; 
whereas there is nothing in man but what is evil, unjust, and profane.  [7] From appearances man supposes that when he does what is good from charity, he does it from his will; whereas it is not from 
his will part, but from his intellectual part, in which charity has been implanted.  [8] From appearances man supposes that there can be no glory without the glory of the world; whereas in the glory 
of heaven there is not a particle of the world's glory.  [9] From appearances man supposes that no one can love his neighbor more than himself, but that all love begins from self; when yet in heavenly 
love there is nothing of the love of self.  [10] From appearances man supposes that there can be no light but that which is from the light of the world; whereas in the heavens there is not one whit 
of the light of the world, and yet the light is so great that it surpasses the world's noon day light a thousand times.  [11] From appearances man supposes that the Lord cannot shine before the universal 
heaven as a sun; when yet all the light of heaven is from Him.  [12] From appearances man cannot apprehend that in the other life there are motions forward; whereas those who are there appear 
to themselves to move forward just as do men on earth-in their dwellings, courts, and paradises; and still less can he apprehend if it is said that these movings forward are changes of state, which so 
appear.  [13] Nor can man from appearances apprehend that spirits and angels, who are invisible before our eyes, can be seen; nor that they can speak with man; when yet they appear to the internal sight, 
or that of the spirit, more manifestly than man does to man on earth; and their voices are heard as distinctly; besides thousands of thousands of such things, which man's rational, from its own 
light, born from things of sense, and thereby darkened, cannot possibly believe. Nay, the rational is blinded in natural things themselves, not being able to apprehend, for instance, how those who dwell 
on the opposite side of the globe can stand on their feet and walk; and it is the same with very many other things. How blind then must the rational not be in spiritual and heavenly things, which are 
far above natural things? [14] As the human rational is of such a character, it is here said of it that it was separated when the Lord in Divine perception was united to the Divine, which is signified 
by the standing of Sarah (who is here such rational truth) at the door of the tent, and by this being behind him. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2196</b></p><p><b>2196.</b>
'And this was behind him' means close to the good which existed with the rational at that time, and separated from it insofar as anything of the human was in it. This is clear from what is said regarding 
the door where Sarah stood - that it was 'behind him'. 'Being behind him' means not joined together but behind his back. That which is separated from someone is represented by that which has been 
cast so to speak behind the back, as may become clear from the representatives in the next life described from experience in <a href="1393.htm">1393</a>, <a href="1875.htm">1875</a>. This separation is expressed here by its being said that the door 
where Sarah stood was behind him. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The situation so far as merely human rational truth - which resided with the Lord at that time and was separated from Him when He joined Himself to the Divine 
- is that human rational truth has no grasp of Divine things because these are above its range of understanding. Such truth does indeed communicate with the facts which are present in the natural 
man; but insofar as it looks from those facts at the things that exist above itself it does not acknowledge these things. For such truth is immersed in appearances of which it cannot rid itself; and appearances 
are born from the evidence of the senses - which leads one to believe as though Divine things themselves are also of a similar nature, when in fact they are free of all appearances. When such 
Divine things are stated this rational truth cannot possibly believe them because it cannot have any grasp of them. Let some examples be given. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 If it is stated that a person has no life except 
that which he receives from the Lord, the rational, seeing from appearances, imagines in that case that he is not able to live as if from himself, when in fact he is for the first time truly living 
when he perceives that he does so from the Lord. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Seeing from appearances the rational imagines that the good which a person does springs from himself, when in fact nothing good at all springs 
from self, but from the Lord. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Seeing from appearances the rational imagines that a person merits salvation when he does what is good, when in fact of himself a person can merit nothing - all merit 
being the Lord's. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 Seeing from appearances a person imagines that when he is being withheld from evil and maintained in good by the Lord, nothing but good, righteousness, and indeed holiness 
are present with him, when in fact present in man there is nothing except evil, unrighteousness, and profanity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 Seeing from appearances a person imagines that when he does what is good from charity 
his will is the source of his actions, when in fact it is not his will that is the source but his understanding in which charity has been implanted. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 Seeing from appearances a person imagines 
that no glory can exist without the glory of the world, when in fact the glory of heaven does not have one trace of the world's glory within it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 Seeing from appearances a person imagines that 
nobody can love the neighbour more than he loves himself, but that all love begins from self, when in fact heavenly love has no self-love at all within it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[10]</b>
 Seeing from appearances a person 
imagines that no light can exist apart from that which flows from the light of this world, when in fact not a ray of the world's light shines in heaven, though the light there is a thousand times brighter 
than the midday light of the world. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[11]</b>
 Seeing from appearances a person imagines that the Lord cannot possibly shine before the whole of heaven as a sun, when in fact the entire light of heaven 
comes from Him. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[12]</b>
 Seeing from appearances no one can grasp the idea that developments take place in the next life, when in fact those there seem to themselves to be making developments - as 
anyone does on earth - in for example, their homes, courtyards, and gardens. Still less can man grasp it if he is told that these are changes of state which manifest themselves outwardly in such developments. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[13]</b>
Seeing from appearances a person cannot grasp that it is because they are not visible before his eyes that spirits and angels are not able to be seen; nor can he grasp that they are able 
to talk to-man, when in fact they are seen more clearly before internal sight, or the sight of the spirit, than man sees man on earth. And their utterances are also in like manner clearly audible. </p>
<p>Besides 
these there are thousands upon thousands of things such as these which man's rational, seeing from its own light, which is born from the evidence of the senses and consequently is darkened, 
cannot possibly believe. Indeed even in natural things the rational is blinded. It is unable to grasp, for example, how those living on the opposite side of the world can stand erect and walk, or to 
grasp very many other natural phenomena. How blind must the rational be then in spiritual and celestial things which are far above those that are natural. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[14]</b>
 Such being the nature of the human rational, 
it is here spoken of as being separated when the Lord, while possessing Divine Perception, was united to the Divine. This is meant by the statement that Sarah, who here is such rational truth, 
'stood at the tent door, and this was behind him'. </p>

`Et ea post illum': quod significet juxta bonum in quo tunc rationale, et separatum ab illo quantum humani ei inerat, constat inde quod dicatur de janua ubi Sarah, quod `fuerit post illum'; `esse post 
illum' significat non conjunctum esse, sed a tergo ejus; quod separatur ab aliquo, hoc repraesentatur per rejectionem quandam quasi in tergum, ut constare potest a repraesentativis {1} in altera vita, 
de quibus ab experientia n. 1393, 1875; hoc nunc exprimitur per quod `janua ubi Sarah, esset post illum.'  [2] Quod verum rationale mere humanum quod tunc apud Dominum, ab Ipso separatum sit cum se 
conjunxit cum Divino, ita se habet: verum rationale humanum non capit Divina quia haec supra ejus intellectus sphaeram sunt, verum enim hoc communicat cum scientificis quae in naturali homine, et quantum 
ex his intuetur illa quae supra se sunt, tantum non agnoscit; est enim verum hoc in apparentiis quas exuere nequit; et apparentiae sunt illa quae nata sunt ex sensualibus, quae inducunt fidem sicut 
ipsa Divina quoque talia sint, cum tamen sunt omnibus apparentiis exempta, quae cum dicuntur, rationale hoc verum nusquam potest credere quia non potest capere.  [3] Sicut pro exemplis: quod nulla 
vita homini nisi quae a Domino; rationale ex apparentiis putat tunc non vivere posse sicut a se, cum tamen tunc primum vere vivit cum percipit quod a Domino {2}: [4] rationale ex apparentiis putat bonum 
quod facit, esse ex semet, cum tamen nihil boni a se sed a Domino: [5] rationale ex apparentiis putat quod mereatur salutem cum bonum facit, cum tamen homo nihil a se mereri possit, sed omne meritum 
sit {3} Domini: [6] homo ex apparentiis putat quod cum detinetur a malo et tenetur in bono a Domino, nihil nisi bonum, et justum, immo sanctum, apud eum, cum tamen in homine nihil nisi malum, injustum, 
et profanum [est]: [7] homo ex apparentiis putat, cum facit bonum ex charitate, quod ex voluntario in se faciat, cum tamen non ex voluntario ejus, sed ex intellectuali cui implantata est charitas: 
[8] homo ex apparentiis putat non dari posse gloriam absque gloria mundi, cum tamen in gloria caeli ne hilum gloriae mundi sit: [9] homo ex apparentiis putat quod nemo possit amare proximum plus quam 
se, sed quod omnis amor incipiat a se, cum tamen in amore caelesti {4} nihil amoris sui insit: [10] homo ex apparentiis putat quod nulla lux dari queat nisi quae ex luce mundi, cum tamen in caelis ne 
hilum lucis mundi sit, et usque tanta lux ut {5} lucem meridianam mundi millies excedat: [11] homo ex apparentiis putat quod Dominus non lucere possit coram universo caelo sicut sol, cum tamen omnis 
lux caeli ab Ipso: [12] homo ex apparentiis non capere potest quod progressiones sint in altera vita, cum tamen apparent sibi progredi prorsus sicut homo in terris, ut in suis habitaculis, atriis, paradisis; 
minus si dicatur quod haec sint mutationes status quae sic apparent: [13] homo ex apparentiis nec capere potest quod spiritus et angeli, quia inconspicui coram oculis, non videri queant, nec 
quod possint loqui cum homine, cum tamen apparent manifestius coram visu interno seu spiritus quam homo homini in terra; et quoque audiuntur loquelae eorum similiter: praeter millia millia talium quae 
rationale hominis nusquam ex suo lumine nato ex sensualibus, et inde obfuscato, potest {6} credere: (m)immo in ipsis naturalibus caecutit rationale, sicut quod capere nequeat quomodo illi qui e diametro 
oppositi sunt incolae, possint pedibus insistere et ambulare, praeter in perplurimis aliis; quid non {7} in spiritualibus et caelestibus, quae longe supra naturalia sunt?(n)  [14] Quia rationale humanum 
tale est, hic dicitur de tali quod separatum fuerit, cum Dominus unitus Divino in Perceptione Divina fuit, quod significatur per quod `Sarah' quae hic est tale verum rationale, `steterit ad januam
