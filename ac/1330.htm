<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1330节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1330.</strong>“以下这些是闪的后代”表第二代古教会的衍生物。这从“后代”的含义清楚可知，“后代”是指教义和敬拜形式的起源和衍生，如前所述（<a href="1145.htm">1145</a>节）。在圣言中，无论此处还是别处，“后代”仅指构成教会的事物，因而指教义和敬拜形式。圣言的内义并不包含别的事物；因此，只要教会产生，经上就说“以下这些是它的后代”，如上古教会产生时，经上说：“以下这些是天与地的后代”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创2.4.htm">2:4</a>）；洪水前随后的教会也一样：“以下这些是后代的族谱”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创5.1.htm">5:1</a>）。洪水后的三代教会同样如此：第一代名为挪亚，第二代名为希伯，第三代名为雅各，后来的教会则以犹大和以色列命名。经上描述第一代古教会时，以同样的方式开始记载：“以下这些是挪亚儿子的后代”（10:1）.所以，对于本节名为希伯的这第二代古教会，经上说：“以下这些是闪的后代”。对本章27节的第三代教会，经上也是这样说的：“以下这些是他拉的后代”。因此，“后代”无非表所描述教会的教义和敬拜形式的起源和衍生。这第二代教会为何源于“闪”，或为何它的开始用“闪”来描述，其原因在于，“闪”表内在敬拜，在此表该教会的内在敬拜。不是因为该教会内在敬拜的性质和前一章“闪”所表示的一样，仅仅因为它是该教会的内在敬拜。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1330.</strong> The symbolism of these are the births of Shem, as developments in the second ancient church is established by the symbolism of births as the origin and development of doctrinal matters and forms of worship. This symbolism was mentioned before, at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1330/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1145" target=_top>1145</a>.<br />Births here and elsewhere in the Word are simply phenomena in the church and consequently are matters of doctrine and worship. The Word's inner meaning involves nothing else. So when a church is born, the text says that its births are such-and-such. When the earliest church was born, for instance, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1330/bible_king-james-version_genesis_2_4" target=_top>Genesis 2:4</a> said, "These are the births of the heavens and the earth." Again, when the other churches that came after that one but before the Flood were born, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1330/bible_king-james-version_genesis_5_1" target=_top>Genesis 5:1</a> said, "This is the book of the births." Likewise with the churches after the Flood, of which there were three: a first, called Noah; a second, named for Eber; and a third, named for Jacob and later for Judah and Israel. When the previous chapter describes the first of these churches, it starts the same way, at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1330/bible_king-james-version_genesis_11_1" target=_top>1</a>: "These are the births of Noah's sons." This second church, named for Eber, is described in similar words in the present verse: "These are the births of Shem." And verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1330/bible_king-james-version_genesis_11_27" target=_top>27</a> of the present chapter says of the third, "These are the births of Terah." So the core meaning of births is the origin and development of the church's doctrinal matters and forms of worship that are being described.<br />The reason that the births of this second church are credited to Shem, or in other words, that the church is described as starting with Shem, is that he symbolizes inward worship. Here he symbolizes the inward worship of this church. The implication is not that the inward devotions of this church were like those symbolized by Shem in the last chapter. It is just that these were the inward devotions of this particular church. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1330</b></p><p><b>1330.</b>
These are the births of Shem. That this signifies the derivations of the Second Ancient Church, is evident from the signification of "births," as being the origin and derivation of doctrinal things and 
of worships (as before said, n. 1145). Here, and elsewhere in the Word, the "births" are no other than those of the church, that is, of doctrinal things and of worships. The internal sense of the Word 
enfolds nothing else; and therefore when any church is born, it is said that "these are its births," as for instance when the Most Ancient Church was born: "These are the births of the heavens and 
of the earth" (Gen. 2:4); and in like manner with the other churches which followed, before the flood: "This is the book of the births" (Gen. 5:1). In like manner with the churches after the flood, which 
were three-the First called Noah, the Second named from Eber, the Third from Jacob, and afterwards from Judah and Israel. When the First of these churches is described, the record begins in a similar 
manner: "These are the births of the sons of Noah" (verse 1 of the preceding chapter). So with this Second church, named from Eber, in this verse: "These are the births of Shem." And with the Third 
also, in the twenty-seventh verse of this chapter: "These are the births of Terah." So that "births" signify nothing else than the origins and derivations of the doctrinal things and of the worships 
of the church that is being described. The reason why the births of this Second church are derived from Shem, or why its beginning is described by "Shem," is that "Shem" signifies internal worship, 
here, the internal worship of this church. Not that the internal worship of this church was such internal worship as that which was signified by "Shem" in the preceding chapter; but merely that it is 
the internal worship of the church.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1330</b></p><p><b>1330.</b>
That 'these are the generations of Shem' means the derivatives of the second Ancient Church is clear from the meaning of 'generations' as the origin and derivation of forms of doctrine and of worship, 
as stated already in <a href="1145.htm">1145</a>. Here and elsewhere in the Word 'generations' are nothing other than the things that constitute the Church, thus forms of doctrine and of worship. The internal sense of the 
Word encompasses nothing else. Consequently when any Church is born the generations of it are mentioned, as with the Most Ancient Church in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%202:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 2:4</a>, 'These are the generations of the heavens and of 
the earth'; and likewise with the other Churches that succeeded it before the Flood, 'This is the book of the generations', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%205:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 5:1</a>. The same is true of the Churches after the Flood which were three 
in number - the first called Noah, the second taking its name from Eber, the third from Jacob and subsequently from Judah and Israel. Verse 1 of the previous chapter, where the first Church is described, 
starts in similar fashion, 'These are the generations of the sons of Noah', as does the present verse in reference to this second Church taking its name from Eber, 'These are the generations of Shem', 
and in reference to the third as well, in verse 27 below, 'These are the generations of Terah'. Consequently 'generations' means nothing other than the origins and derivatives of forms of doctrine 
and of worship in the Church that is being described. The reason why the generations of this second Ancient Church are traced back to Shem, that is, why its beginning is described from Shem onwards, 
is that 'Shem' means internal worship, here the internal worship of this Church. Not that the nature of the internal worship of this Church was the same as that meant by 'Shem' in the previous chapter, 
but only that it is the internal worship of this Church. </p>

'Hae nativitates Shemi':  quod significent derivationes alterius Ecclesiae Antiquae, constat a significatione 'nativitatum' quod sit origo et derivatio doctrinalium et cultuum, ut dictum prius n. 1145; 
'nativitates' hic et alibi in Verbo non aliae sunt quam quae sunt Ecclesiae, ita quae sunt doctrinalium et cultuum; internus sensus Verbi nihil aliud involvit; quare cum Ecclesia aliqua nascitur, 
dicitur quod 'nativitates illius sint,' ut cum Ecclesia Antiquissima Gen. ii 4, 'Hae nativitates caelorum et terrae':  pariter cum ceterae Ecclesiae ante diluvium quae successerunt, v vers. 1, 'Hic liber 
nativitatum'; similiter Ecclesiae post diluvium quae tres fuerunt, prima Noahus dicta, altera ab Ebero nominata, tertia a Jacobo, haec postea a Jehuda et Israele; prima Ecclesia cum describitur, similiter 
incohatur, cap. praec. vers. 1, 'Hae nativitates filiorum Noahi'; haec altera ab Ebero nominata, similiter in hoc versu, 'Hae nativitates Shemi'; tertia quoque versu 27 hujus capitis, 'Hae nativitates 
Terahi':  quare 'nativitates' nihil aliud significant quam origines et derivationes doctrinalium et cultuum Ecclesiae quae describitur.  Quod nativitates secundae hujus Ecclesiae a Shemo ducantur, 
seu quod initium ejus describatur a Shemo, causa est quia 'Shemus' significat cultum internum, hic cultum internum hujus Ecclesiae; non quod cultus internus hujus Ecclesiae fuerit talis cultus 
internus qualis in cap. praec. significatus est per 'Shemum,' sed modo quod sit cultus internus hujus Ecclesiae. </p>
