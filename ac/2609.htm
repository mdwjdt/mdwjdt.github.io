<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2609.</strong>但是，关于生活的律例，如十诫，以及律法和先知里的很多律例，因有助于人的生活，故无论在字义上还是内义上，都是有用处的。包含在字义中的事适合那个时期的百姓和各民，因为他们不理解内在事物；而包含在内义中的事则适合天使，因为天使根本不关心外在事物。十诫若不包含内义，永远不会以如此大的奇迹在西奈山上被颁布。因为它所包含的一切事，如当孝敬父母、不可偷盗、不可杀人、不可奸淫、不贪恋他人的东西等，都是连外邦人也知道，并且也是他们的法律所规定的事。这些律法即便不在西奈山颁布，作为人类成员的以色列也很熟悉它们。但是，这些律例在两种意义上服务于生活，并且如同内在所产生的外在形式，内在与外在彼此对应，所以它们以如此大的奇迹从天上降到西奈山上，并且就其内义而言，在天堂被宣布和听到，就其字义而言，则在世上被宣布和听到。<br />以这一诫命为例，即当孝敬父母，使他们的日子在地上得以长久：天上的天使将“父母”理解为主；将“地”理解为祂的国度，那些出于爱与信敬拜主的人必永远作为儿子和继承者而拥有它；而世人则将“父母”理解为生身父母；将“地”理解为迦南地；将“他们的日子长久”理解为他们的寿命。再以不可偷盗的诫命为例，即：天上的天使将其理解为不可拿走主的任何东西，不可将功义归给自己；而世人则理解为不可偷东西。由此可见，这些律例在这两种意义上都是对的。同样以不可杀人的诫命为例：天上的天使将其理解为不可仇恨任何人，不可毁灭任何人所具有的任何良善与真理；而世人则理解为不可杀他们的朋友。其它诫命也一样。</p>

But as regards the Precepts of Life, such as all things in the Decalogue, and many in the Law and the Prophets-these, being of service to man's very life, are of use in both senses, both the literal 
and the internal. The things contained in the literal sense were for the people and peoples of that period, who did not apprehend internal things; and the things contained in the internal sense were for 
the angels, who have no care for external things. Unless the precepts of the Decalogue contained internal things also, they would never have been promulgated on Mount Sinai with so great a miracle; 
for such things as it contains, such as that parents are to be honored, that men must not steal, must not kill, must not commit adultery, must not covet what is another's, are things which the Gentiles 
also know and have prescribed in their laws; and which the sons of Israel as men must have been well acquainted with, without such a promulgation. But as those precepts were for the service of life, 
in both senses, and were as external forms produced from internal, that corresponded to each other-this was the reason why they came down out of heaven upon Mount Sinai with so great a miracle, and 
in their internal sense were uttered and heard in heaven, while in their external sense they were uttered and heard on earth. [2] Take as an example the promise that they who honor their parents shall 
have their days prolonged upon the land: by "parents" the angels in heaven perceived the Lord; by the "land," His kingdom, which those who worship Him from love and faith should eternally possess as 
sons and heirs; whereas by "parents" men on earth understood parents; by "land," the land of Canaan; by the "prolongation of their days," the years of their life. Take again the precept that men must 
not steal: by this the angels who were in heaven perceived that they should take nothing away from the Lord, and should not claim anything of righteousness and merit for themselves; whereas men on earth 
understood that they must not steal; from which we can see that these precepts are true in both senses. Take again the precept that men must not kill: by this the angels in heaven perceived that they 
should not hate anyone, and should not extinguish anything of good and truth with anyone; whereas men on earth understood that their friends must not be killed. The case is the same with all the other 
precepts.            GENESIS 21 </p>
<p>     1. And Jehovah visited Sarah, as He had said; and Jehovah did unto Sarah as He had spoken.      2. And Sarah conceived and bare Abraham a son in his old 
age, at the appointed time, as God had spoken with him.      3. And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.      4. And Abraham circumcised Isaac his 
son, a son of eight days, as God had commanded him.      5. And Abraham was a son of a hundred years when Isaac his son was born unto him.      6. And Sarah said, God hath made laughter for me, everyone 
that heareth will laugh with me.      7. And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, Sarah shall suckle sons? For I have borne a son to his old age.      8. And the child grew, and was weaned; 
and Abraham made a great feast, on the day when he weaned Isaac.      9. And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne unto Abraham, mocking.      10. And she said unto Abraham, 
Cast out this handmaid and her son; for the son of this handmaid shall not inherit with my son, with Isaac.      11. And the word was evil exceedingly in the eyes of Abraham, on account of his son.  
    12. And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be evil in thine eyes because of the boy, and because of thine handmaid; all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her voice, for in Isaac shall 
thy seed be called.      13. And also the son of the handmaid I will make a nation, because he is thy seed.      14. And Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and 
gave to Hagar, and put them on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away; and she went and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.      15. And the water was spent out of the bottle, and she cast 
the child under one of the shrubs.      16. And she went and sat by herself over against him, withdrawing about a bowshot; for she said, Let me not see the death of the child; and she sat over against 
him; and she lifted up her voice, and wept.      17. And God heard the voice of the child, and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? Fear not, 
for God hath heard the voice of the child where he is.      18. Arise, lift up the child, and strengthen thy hand in him, for I will make him a great nation.      19. And God opened her eyes, and 
she saw a well of water, and she went and filled the bottle with water, and gave the child drink.      20. And God was with the child, and he grew, and he dwelt in the wilderness, and became a shooter 
of the bow.      21. And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran; and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.      22. And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain 
of his army said unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest.      23. And now swear unto me here by God, that thou wilt not be false to me, nor to my son, nor to my son's son; 
according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.      24. And Abraham said, I will swear.      25. And Abraham reproved Abimelech, 
because of the well of water which Abimelech's servants had taken away.      26. And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this word, neither didst thou tell me, neither heard I of it, but 
today.      27. And Abraham took flock and herd, and gave to Abimelech, and they two struck a covenant.      28. And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.      29. And Abimelech 
said unto Abraham, What are these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?      30. And he said, Because these seven ewe lambs thou shalt take from my hand, that it may be a witness unto me 
that I have digged this well.      31. Therefore he called that place Beersheba, because there they sware both of them.      32. And they struck a covenant at Beersheba; and Abimelech rose up, and 
Phicol the captain of his army, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.      33. And he planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the God of eternity.      34. And Abraham 
sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days. </p>

But as regards commandments to do with life<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> - as all the Ten Commandments are, and as very many in the Law and the Prophets are because the service which these perform is to man's very life, they are 
of use in both senses, the literal sense and the internal. The things that exist in the literal sense were for the people and peoples of that period, who had no understanding of things that were internal, 
while the things that exist in the internal sense were for the angels, who have no interest in things that are external. Unless the Ten Commandments also contained internal things, they would never 
have been declared on Mount Sinai by means of so great a miraculous event; for everything contained in them, such as the commands to honour one's parents, not to steal, not to murder, not to commit 
adultery, not to covet what belongs to another, is known to gentiles also and has been laid down for them in their laws. And the children of Israel too, being members of the human race, ought to have 
known the same without any such declaration from Sinai. But it was because those commandments in both senses were to be of service to man's life, and were as external forms produced from internal, 
which corresponded to one another, that they came down out of heaven on Mount Sinai by means of so great a miraculous event - being declared and heard in heaven in the internal sense and declared and 
heard on earth in the external sense. </p>

 Take, for example, the words that those who honoured their parents would have their days prolonged upon the land. By 'parents' the angels in heaven perceived 
the Lord, and by 'land' His kingdom, which those who worship Him in love and faith would possess for ever as sons and heirs. People on earth however understood parents by 'parents', the land of Canaan 
by 'the land', and years of life by 'the prolonging of their days'. By 'do not steal' angels in heaven perceived that they were not to take anything away from the Lord nor to ascribe any righteousness 
and merit at all to themselves. People on earth however understood that they were not to steal. From this it is clear that these commandments are true in both senses. Or take the commandment 'not 
to murder'; angels in heaven perceived that they were not to hate anyone nor to destroy any good and truth existing with another. But people on earth perceived that friends must not be murdered. And 
so it is with all the other commandments. <A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> i.e. as distinct from those to do with worship </p>

Quod autem praecepta vitae attinet, ut sunt omnia Decalogi, et plura in Lege et Prophetis, illa quia ipsi vitae hominis inserviunt, sunt usui in utroque sensu, tam in litterali quam in interno: quae 
in sensu litterali, fuerunt pro populo et populis istius temporis, qui interna non capiebant; quae in sensu interno, fuerunt pro angelis, qui externa non curant: nisi praecepta Decalogi etiam continerent 
interna, nusquam cum tanto miraculo promulgata fuissent in monte Sinai; talia enim quae ibi, ut quod honorandi parentes, non furandum, non occidendum, non adulterandum, non concupiscenda alterius, 
sunt {1} quae etiam gentiles norunt, et in suis legibus praescripta habent, et quae filii Israelis quatenus homines novisse debuerunt absque tali promulgatione; sed quia praecepta illa inserviebant 
vitae in utroque sensu, et erant sicut formae externae productae ab internis, quae sibi correspondent, ideo e caelo super monte Sinai cum tanto miraculo descendebant, ac in sensu interno dicta et audita 
in caelo, at in sensu externo dicta et audita in terra; [2] ut pro exemplo, quod qui honorarent parentes, iis prolongarentur dies super terra; angeli qui in caelo, per `parentes' percipiebant Dominum, 
per `terram' Ipsius regnum, quod in aeternum sicut filii et heredes possiderent qui Ipsum ex amore et fide colunt; homines autem in terra per `parentes' intelligebant parentes, per `terram' terram 
Canaanem, per `prolongationem dierum' annos vitae; {2} quod `non furandum,' angeli qui in caelo, percipiebant quod nihil adimerent Domino, (c)et sibi justitiae et meriti aliquid tribuerent; homines autem 
in terra, quod non furandum; haec quod vera sint in utroque sensu, constat: adhuc, quod `non occidendum,' angeli in caelo percipiebant quod non odio aliquem haberent, et quod non exstinguerent aliquid

 ET JEHOVAH visitavit Saram, quemadmodum dixit; et fecit JEHOVAH Sarae, quemadmodum locutus est. 	2.  Et concepit et peperit Saram, Abrahamo filium senectuti illius, ad tempus statum, ut locutus fuit 
cum illo DEUS. 	3.  Et vocavit Abraham nomen filii sui nati sibi, quem peperit ei Sarah, Jishak. 	4.  Et circumcidit Abraham Jishakum filium suum, filium octo dierum, quemadmodum praecepit illi DEUS. 	5. 
 Et Abraham filius centum annorum, cum nasceretur illi Jishak filius ejus. 	6.  Et dixit Sarah, Risum fecit mihi DEUS, omnis audiens ridebit mihi. 	7.  Et dixit, Quis dixisset Abrahamo, Lactabit 
filios Sarah? quia peperit filium senectuti illius. 	8.  Et crevit natus, et ablactatus, et fecit Abraham convivium magnum, in die cum ablactavit Jishakum. 	9.  Et vidit Sarah filium Hagaris Aegyptiae, 
quem peperit Abrahamo, illudentem. 	10.  Et dixit Abrahamo, Ejice ancillam hanc, et filium ejus, quia non hereditabit filius ancillae hujus cum filio meo, cum Jishako. 	11.  Et malum fuit verbum 
valde in oculis Abrahami, ob causas filii sui. 	12.  Et dixit DEUS ad Abrahamum, Ne malum sit in oculis tuis super puerum, et super ancillam tuam; omne quod dicit ad te Sarah, audi voci ejus, quia 
in Jishako vocabitur tibi semen. 					*	*	* 	13.  Et etiam filium ancillae in gentem ponam eum, quia semen tuum. 	14.  Et mane surrexit Abraham in matutino, et accepit panem et lagenam aquae, et 
dedit ad Hagar, posuit super humero ejus, puerum, et emisit illam; et ivit et erravit in deserto Beersheba. 	15.  Et consumptae sunt aquae e lagena, et conjecit puerum sub unum fruticum. 	16.  Et 
ivit, et sedit sibi e regione, elongando se circiter jactum arcus, quia dixit, Ne videam mortem pueri, et sedit e regione, sustulit vocem suam; et flevit. 	17.  Et audivit DEUS vocem pueri, et clamavit 
angelus DEI Hagarem e caelo, et dixit ei, Quid tibi Hagar? ne timeas, quia audivit DEUS vocem pueri, in quo ille ibi. 	18.  Surge, tolle puerum, et corrobora manum tuam in illo, quia in gentem magnam 
ponam illum. 	19.  Et aperuit Deus oculos ejus, et vidit puteum aquae, et ivit, et implevit lagenam aquae, et potavit puerum. 	20.  Et fuit DEUS cum puero, et crevit, et habitavit in deserto, et 
fuit jaculator arcus. 	21.  Et habitavit in deserto Paran; et accepit illi mater ejus uxorem e terra Aegypti. 					*	*	* 	22.  Et fuit in tempore illo, et dixit Abimelech, et Phicol princeps exercitus 
ejus, ad Abrahamum, dicendo, Deus tecum in omnibus quae tu faciens. 	23.  Et nunc jura mihi in DEUM hic, si mentitus fueris mihi, et filio meo, et nepoti meo; secundum benignitatem, quam feci tecum, 
facias mecum, et cum terra, in qua peregrinatus es. 	24.  Et dixit Abraham, Ego jurabo. 	25.  Et redarguit Abraham Abimelechum, ob causas putei aquae, quem eripuerunt servi Abimelechi. 	26.  Et 
dixit Abimelech, Non novi quis fecit verbum hoc, et etiam tu non indicasti mihi, et etiam ego non audivi, praeter quam hodie. 	27.  Et accepit Abraham gregem et armentum, et dedit Abimelecho, et percusserunt 
ambo illi foedus. 	28.  Et statuit Abraham septem agnas gregis solas eas. 	29.  Et dixit Abimelech ad Abrahamum, Quid hae septem agnae illae, quas statuisti solas? 	30.  Et dixit, Quia septem 
agnas accipies e manu mea, propterea sit mihi in testimonium, quod fodi puteum hunc. 	31.  Propterea vocavit locum illa Beersheba, quia ibi juraverunt ambo illi. 	32.  Et percusserunt foedus in 
Beersheba; et surrexit Abimelech, et Phicol princeps exercitus illius; et reversi sunt ad terram Philistaeorum. 	33.  Et plantavit lucum in Beersheba; et invocavit ibi nomen DEI aeternitatis. 	34. 
 Et peregrinatus est Abraham in terra Philistaeorum diebus multis. </p>
