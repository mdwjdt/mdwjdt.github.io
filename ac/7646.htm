<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7646节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7646.</strong>“并且吞吃那逃脱的余剩物，就是冰雹所剩给你们的”表含有任何真理成分在里面的一切事物的消耗。这从“吞吃”和“那逃脱的余剩物，就是冰雹所剩的”的含义清楚可知：“吞吃”是指消耗；“那逃脱的余剩物，就是冰雹所剩的”是指被“冰雹”所表示的以前那种虚假消耗或毁灭的真理。“冰雹”表示虚假（参看<a href="7553.htm">7553</a>，<a href="7574.htm">7574</a>节）。“冰雹”所表示的虚假是外层属世层中的虚假；而“蝗虫”所表示的虚假是指它的最外面部分中的虚假。这后一类虚假就是那消耗最总体的真理和良善的；因为相对外在的事物也相对总体，最外在的事物是最总体的。当总体事物被毁时，具体事物就会散开；因为前者是盛纳的容器，而后者是它们的盛纳物。</p>

And it shall devour the residue of that which is escaped that is left to you from the hail. That this signifies the consuming of all things that have anything from truth, is evident from the signification 
of "to devour," as being to be consumed; and from the signification of "the residue of that which is escaped that is left from the hail," as being the truth not consumed by the former falsity which 
is signified by the "hail." (That "hail" denotes falsity, see n. 7553, 7574.) The falsities which the "hail" signifies are falsities in the exterior natural; but the falsities which the "locust" signifies 
are falsities in its extremes, and these falsities are what consume the most general truths and goods; for what is exterior is also more general, and what is external is most general. When the 
generals have been destroyed, the particulars are dispersed; for it is generals that contain, and particulars that are contained.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7646</b></p><p><b>7646.</b>
'And they will devour the residue of what escaped and was left to you from the hail' means the consumption of all things that have any element of truth in them. This is clear from the meaning of 'devouring' 
being consumed; and from the meaning of 'the residue of what escaped and was left from the hail' as truth that was not consumed or destroyed by the previous kind of falsity that is meant by 'the 
hail'. For the meaning of 'the hail' as falsity, see <a href="7553.htm">7553</a>, <a href="7574.htm">7574</a>. The falsities meant by 'the hail' are falsities in the exterior natural, but the falsities meant by 'the locusts' are falsities in the 
outermost parts of it. The latter falsities are what consume the most general truths and forms of good; for comparatively external things are also comparatively general, and the most external ones 
are the most general. When general things have been destroyed particular ones are scattered, for the former are the containers, and the latter are their contents. </p>

`Et comedet residuum evasionis relictae vobis a grandine': quod significet consumptionem omnium quae aliquid (c)ex vero habent, constat ex significatione `comedere' quod sit {1}consumi; et a significatione 
`residui evasionis relictae a grandine' quod {2}sit verum non consumptum a priore falso, quod per `grandinem' significatur; {3}quod `grando' sit falsum, videatur n. 7553, 7574; falsa quae `grando' 
significat sunt falsa in exteriore naturali, at falsa quae `locusta' significat sunt falsa in extremis ejus; haec falsa sunt quae consumunt vera et bona communissima; nam exteriora sunt quoque communiora, 
et {4}externa sunt communissima; quando communia destructa sunt, particularia dissipantur, nam communia sunt quae continent, et particularia quae continentur. 	@1 consumtio$ 	@2 significet$ 	@3 
Grando enim significabat falsa quae consumebant vera et bona in exteriori naturali; at locusta significat falsa quae consumunt vera et bona en extremis ejus, ita quae consumunt communissima$ 	@4 extrema$ </p>
