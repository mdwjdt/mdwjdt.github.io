Verses 46-49. And Joseph was a son of thirty years when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from before Pharaoh, and passed over into all the land of Egypt. And the earth made 
gatherings in the seven years of abundance of produce. And he gathered together all the food of the seven years that were in the land of Egypt, and put the food in the cities, the food of the field of 
the city, that which was round about it, put he in the midst thereof. And Joseph heaped up corn as the sand of the sea, exceeding much, until he ceased to number, because it was without number. "And 
Joseph was a son of thirty years," signifies a full state of remains; "when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt," signifies when its presence was in the natural; "and Joseph went out from before Pharaoh," 
signifies when the natural in general belonged to the celestial of the spiritual; "and passed over into all the land of Egypt," signifies when it made everything therein subordinate and submissive; 
"and the earth made gatherings in the seven years of abundance of produce," signifies the first states when truths are multiplied in series; "and he gathered together all the food of the seven years," 
signifies the preservation of truth adjoined to good multiplied during the first times; "that were in the land of Egypt," signifies in the natural; "and put the food in the cities," signifies that 
it stored up in the interiors; "the food of the field of the city," signifies things that belong and are suitable to them; "that which was round about it he put in the midst thereof," signifies the 
things previously in the exterior natural, it stored up in the interiors of the interior natural; "and Joseph heaped up corn as the sand of the sea, exceeding much," signifies the multiplying of truth 
from good; "until he ceased to number, because it was without number," signifies such as had in it the celestial from the Divine. </p>

Verses 46-49 And Joseph was a son of thirty years when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt; and Joseph came out from before Pharaoh, and went through all the land of Egypt. And in the seven years of

<p>'And Joseph was a son 
of thirty years' means a state when the quantity of remnants was complete. 'When he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt' means the presence of the celestial of the spiritual in the natural. 'And Joseph 
came out from before Pharaoh' means when the natural in general belonged to it. 'And went through all the land of Egypt' means when it made each thing there subordinate and submissive. 'And in the seven 
years of abundance of corn the land yielded bunches' means initial states when series of truths were multiplied. 'And he gathered all the food of the seven years' means the preservation of truth 
linked to good, multiplied in the initial phases. 'Which were in the land of Egypt' means within the natural. 'And laid up food in the cities' means that it stored them in the interior parts. 'The food 
of the field of a city' means that these were proper to and suitable for those interior parts. 'Which was round about it he laid up in the midst of it' means what existed first in the exterior natural 
was stored away by it in the interior parts of the interior natural. 'And Joseph stored up grain like the sand of the sea, very much' means a multiplication of truth derived from good. 'Until he left 
off numbering, because it was beyond number' means such as holds the celestial from the Divine within it.

Vers. 46-49.  Et Joseph filius triginta annorum in stando eo coram Pharaone rege Aegypti, et exivit Joseph a coram Pharaone, et transivit in omnem terram Aegypti. Et fecit terra in septem annis abundantiae 
annonae collectiones. Et congregavit omnem cibum septem annorum, qui fuerunt in terra Aegypti, et dedit cibum in urbibus, cibum agri urbis quae circumcirca illam, dedit in medio illius. Et congessit 
Joseph frumentum sicut arenam maris multum valde, usque quod cessavit ad numerandum, quia nullus numerus. `Et Joseph filius triginta annorum' significat statum plenum reliquiarum: `in stando eo 
coram Pharaone rege Aegypti' significat cum praesentia ejus in naturali: `et exivit Joseph a coram Pharaone' significat cum ipsius esset naturale in communi: `et transivit in omnem terram Aegypti' significat 
cum subordinaret et submitteret singula ibi: `et fecit terra in septem annis abundantiae annonae collectiones' significat primos status cum multiplicata vera in series: `et congregavit omnem 
cibum septem annorum' significat conservationem veri bono adjuncti, multiplicati primis temporibus: `qui fuerunt in terra Aegypti' significat quod in naturali: `et dedit cibum in urbibus' significat quod 
reposuerit in interioribus:  `cibum agri urbis' significat quae propria eis et convenientia: `quae circumcirca illam dedit in medio illius' significat quae prius in exteriore naturali fuerunt, recondit 
in interioribus interioris naturalis: `et congessit Joseph frumentum sicut arenam maris multum valde' significat multiplicationem veri a bono: `usque quod cessavit ad numerandum, quia nullus numerus' 
significat tale in quo caeleste a Divino.  </p>
