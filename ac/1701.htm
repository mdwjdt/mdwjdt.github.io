<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1701.</strong>“有一个逃出来的人，告诉希伯来人亚伯兰”表主凭祂的内层人（Interior Man）发觉，这从“希伯来人亚伯兰”的含义清楚可知，它就是稍后所论述的要与内在人（Internal）或神性人（Divine Man）结合的内层人。由于这些描述在内义上论及主，且这些历史细节具有代表性，故显而易见，“有一个逃出来的人，告诉”无非表示主发觉。内层人能直觉外在人中正在发生的一切，就象有人告知一样。主拥有对正发生的一切事的直觉，祂非常清楚发生在自己身上的这些事的性质和源头。例如，若有恶事占据外在人的情感，或谬论占据它的思维，祂必清楚它的性质和源头。祂甚至知道是哪类恶灵激活了这些事，如何做的等等。因为诸如此类的事和不计其数的其它事都瞒不住天使，几乎也瞒不住拥有属天直觉的世人，它们在主面前更是一览无余。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1701.</strong> An escapee came and told Abram the Hebrew means that the Lord sensed things in his intermediate self, which can be seen from the symbolism of Abram the Hebrew as his intermediate self, united to his inward self. This will be discussed directly below. Because the inner meaning of these words has to do with the Lord, and because the historical events represent him, it is clear that an escapee came and told only means that the Lord sensed something.<br />Our intermediate self senses what is going on in our outward self as if someone were reporting on it. The Lord was aware of everything that was happening and recognized clearly the nature and source of everything that emerged in him. If any evil monopolized the emotions of his outer self or any false idea monopolized his thinking, for instance, he inevitably knew what its nature was and where it came from. He could also tell exactly which evil spirits were stirring it up, and how, besides much else. These kinds of details and countless others are not hidden from angels and are only barely concealed from people on earth who have a heavenly type of perception. Still less would they escape the Lord. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1701</b></p><p><b>1701.</b>
And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew. That this signifies that the Lord perceived from His interior man, is evident from the signification of "Abram the Hebrew," as being the 
interior man conjoined with the internal, explained just below. And as in the internal sense these things are predicated of the Lord, and the historicals are representative, it is evident that the coming 
of one who had escaped, and his telling, signifies nothing else than that the Lord perceived. The interior man perceives what is going on in the external man just as if one were to tell it. The 
Lord, who had a perception of all things that were taking place, knew very clearly the quality and the source of all that took place in connection with Himself, as for example if anything of evil were 
taking possession of the affections of His external man, or anything of falsity of its thoughts, He could not but know what it was, and whence; and also what evil spirits were exciting the evil and the 
falsity; and how they were exciting them, besides other things; for such things, and others beyond number, are not concealed from the angels, and scarcely from men who have celestial perception, still 
less from the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1701</b></p><p><b>1701.</b>
That 'one who had escaped came and told it to Abram the Hebrew' means that the Lord perceived from His Interior Man is clear from the meaning of 'Abram the Hebrew' as the Interior Man when joined to 
the Internal Man, dealt with just below. As in the internal sense these descriptions have reference to the Lord, and the historical details are representative, it is evident that 'one who had escaped 
came and told it' means nothing else than that the Lord perceived. The Interior Man perceives what is going on in the External Man, just as if someone were to tell of that activity. The Lord, who had 
a perception of all things that were taking place, knew very clearly the nature and the origin of the things that were occurring with Himself. For example, if something evil was taking possession of the 
affections of the External Man or if something false was taking possession of its cognitions, He inevitably knew the nature and the origin of it. He even knew which evil spirits were activating those 
things and how they did it, and many other things besides. For matters such as these, and countless others, do not lie hidden from angels, and scarcely so from men who have celestial perception. Still 
less were they hidden from the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1701</b>
</p><b>1701.</b>
Quod 'venit evasor et indicavit Abramo Hebraeo' significet quod perciperet Dominus ex Interiore Ipsius Homine, constat a significatione 'Abrami Hebraei' quod sit Interior Homo conjunctus Interno, de 
qua mox infra; et quia in interno sensu praedicantur haec de Domino, et historica sunt repraesentativa, patet quod 'veni evasor et indicavit' non aliud significet quam quod Dominus perceperit: quod in 
Externo Homine peragitur, Interior Homo percipit sicut foret quasi quis indicaret; Dominus Qui perceptionem omnium quae fiebant, habuit, manifeste novit qualia et unde illa quae apud Ipsum existebant; 
ut si quid mali occuparet Externi Hominis affectiones aut si quid falsi ejus cognitiones; non potuit non nosse quale esset et unde, sed etiam quinam spiritus mali excitarent illa, et quomodo excitarent, 
praeter plura; nam talia et innumerabilia alia non latent angelos, et vix homines qui perceptionem caelestem habent, minus Dominum. </p>
