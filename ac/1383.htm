<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">第12章  关于来世灵人和天使所拥有的直觉，以及气场</h4><br />1383.来世的奇迹之一就是直觉。直觉分为两种：一种是天使般的直觉，它在于直觉什么是真与善，什么是出于主的，什么是出于自我的，以及源于自我的思维、话语和行为的来源和性质；另一种是所有人共有的直觉，它在于别人一靠近，人就知道他的品性，最完美的天使，以及灵人们根据各自的品质都拥有这种直觉。</p>

One exists with angels: they perceive what is true and good, what comes from the Lord and what from themselves, and what the source and nature of their thoughts, words, and deeds is, when these come from themselves. The other kind is one that is common to everyone — to angels at the peak of perfection and to spirits according to their quality: as soon as another person approaches, they know what that person is like. </p>

CHAPTER 12      CONCERNING THE PERCEPTION OF SPIRITS AND OF ANGELS AND CONCERNING SPHERES IN THE OTHER LIFE. Among the wonderful things in the other life are perceptions, of which there are two kinds. 
One kind, which is angelic perception, consists in perceiving what is true and good, and what is from the Lord, and what from the persons themselves; and also in perceiving the source and quality 
of their thoughts, words, and actions, when these are from themselves. The other kind is common to all, to angels in the highest perfection, and to spirits according to their respective qualities, and 
consists in knowing the quality of another on his first approach. </p>

<p>THE PERCEPTION SPIRITS AND ANGELS HAVE; ALSO SPHERES IN THE NEXT LIFE </p>
<p>Among the marvels in the next life are perceptions, of which there are two kinds. The first, which is angelic, consists 
in the angels perceiving what is true and good, perceiving what is from the Lord and what from self, and also perceiving the source and nature of their own thoughts, speech, and actions when these spring 
from self. The second kind is one that is common to all - with angels to the height of perfection, and with spirits according to the particular character of each one - and consists in knowing the 
character of another as soon as he approaches. </p>

GENESEOS CAPUT DUODECIMUM De Perceptione Spirituum et Angelorum: deque Sphaeris in altera vita </p>
<p>INTER mirabilia in altera vita, sunt perceptiones; quarum duo genera sunt; unum quod est angelicum 
quod percipiant quid verum et bonum, et quid a Domino, quid a semet, tum quod cogitant, loquuntur et agunt, cum a semet, unde et quale sit: alterum genus est quod commune omnibus, angelis in summa perfectione, 
et spiritibus secundum qualitatem ejus, quod ad primum adventum alterius, sciant qualis est. </p>
