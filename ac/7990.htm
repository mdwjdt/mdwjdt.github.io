<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7990节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7990.</strong>“因耶和华领他们出了埃及地”表从属灵的囚禁中被释放出来。这从“领出”和“埃及地”的含义清楚可知：“领出”是指释放；“埃及地”是指他们被恶人侵扰所在之地，因而是指他们陷入属灵囚禁所在之地，正如前面所引用的内容（<a href="6854.htm">6854</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>，<a href="7035.htm">7035</a>，<a href="7091.htm">7091</a>，<a href="7828.htm">7828</a>，<a href="7932.htm">7932</a>，<a href="7985.htm">7985</a>节）。当人们的内层被主保守在良善和真理中，而外层却被地狱拘守在邪恶和虚假中时，就说他们陷入属灵的囚禁，由此有了外在人与内在人的争战。那些正遭受侵扰的人就处于这种状态；在此期间，主通过经由他们内层的流注代表他们而与来自地狱的邪恶和虚假的流向争战。这时，他们像囚犯一样被关押；因为由于来自主的流注，他们想要处于良善和真理，但由于来自地狱的流向，他们觉得自己似乎不能。这种争战的发生，是为了外在人能顺服内在人，属世事物以这种方式能从属于属灵事物。</p>

For leading them forth from the land of Egypt. That this signifies liberation from spiritual captivity, is evident from the signification of "leading forth," as being to liberate; and from the signification 
of "the land of Egypt," as being where they were infested by the evil, thus where they were in spiritual captivity, according to what has been adduced (n. 6854, 6914, 7035, 7091, 7828, 7932a, 
7985). They are said to be in spiritual captivity who as to their interiors are kept by the Lord in good and truth, but as to their exteriors are kept by hell in evil and falsity, whence there is a combat 
of the external man with the internal. In this state are those kept who are being infested; and then the Lord by influx through the interiors fights for them against the afflux of evil and falsity 
from the hells. They are then kept as it were captive, for through influx from the Lord they desire to be in good and truth, but through the afflux from the hells they seem to themselves not to be able. 
This combat takes place to the end that the external man may be reduced to obedience to the internal, and thus natural things be made subordinate to spiritual things. </p>

'To lead them out of the land of Egypt' means deliverance from spiritual captivity. This is clear from the meaning of 'leading out' as delivering; and from the meaning of 'the land of Egypt' as the place 
where they were molested by the evil, thus where they were in spiritual captivity, as accords with the matters introduced in <a href="6854.htm">6854</a>, <a href="6914.htm">6914</a>, <a href="7035.htm">7035</a>, <a href="7091.htm">7091</a>, <a href="7828.htm">7828</a>, <a href="7932.htm">7932</a>, <a href="7985.htm">7985</a>. People are said to be in spiritual 
captivity when inwardly they are maintained by the Lord in goodness and truth, but outwardly they are kept by hell in evil and falsity, as a result of which there is conflict between the external 
man and the internal man. This is the state in which those who are being molested are held. During it, by an influx (or flowing into them) by way of their interiors, the Lord fights on their behalf 
against the afflux (or flowing towards them) of evil and falsity from the hells. At this time they are held like captives; for as a result of the influx from the Lord they wish to be guided by truth 
and good, but the afflux from the hells makes it seem to them that they are incapable of it. This conflict takes place to the end that the external man may be brought into obedience to the internal man, 
and in that way natural things may be made subordinate to spiritual ones. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 7990</b>
</p><b>7990.</b>
`Ad educendum illos e terra Aegypti': quod significet liberationem ex captivitate spirituali, constat ex significatione `educere' quod sit liberare; et ex significatione `terrae Aegypti' quod sit ubi 
infestati a malis, ita ubi fuerunt in captivitate spirituali, secundum illa quae n. 6854, 6914, 7035, 7091, 7828, 7932, 7985, allata sunt.  In captivitate spirituali dicuntur esse qui quoad interiora 
tenentur a Domino in bono et vero, sed quoad exteriora ab inferno in malo et falso; unde pugna externi hominis cum interno; in hoc statu tenentur qui infestantur; et tunc Dominus per influxum per interiora 
pugnat pro illis contra affluxum mali et falsi ab infernis; tenentur tunc sicut captivi, nam per influxum a Domino volunt in bono et vero esse, sed per affluxum ab infernis videntur sibi non posse. 
 Haec pugna fit ob finem ut externus homo redigatur ad oboedientiam interni, et sic naturalia subordinentur spiritualibus. </p>
