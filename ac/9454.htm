<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9454节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9454.</strong>这些怜悯就是约翰福音中这些话的意思：<br />凡接待祂的，就是信祂名的人，祂就赐他们权柄，作神的儿女。这等人不是从血生的，不是从肉欲生的，也不是从人意生的，乃是从神生的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.12.htm">1:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.13.htm">13</a>）<br />“从血生的”是指那些反对信与仁之良善的人；“从肉欲生的”是指那些沉浸于源于爱自己爱世界的邪恶之人；“从人意生的”是指那些沉浸于由这些邪恶所产生的虚假之人；“从神生”是指被重生。没有人能进入天堂，除非他重生，这一点在约翰福音也有教导：<br />我实实在在地告诉你：人若不重生，就不能见神的国。我实实在在地告诉你：人若不是从水和灵生的，就不能进神的国。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.3.htm">3:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.5.htm">5</a>）<br />“从水生”表示通过信之真理；“从灵生”表示通过爱之良善。由此可见罪得赦免的，到底是谁；罪不得赦免的，又是谁。</p>

This is what is meant in John: </p>
<p>     As many as received Him, to them gave He power to be sons of God, to them that believe in His name; who were born, not of bloods, nor of the will of the flesh, nor 
of the will of man, but of God (John 1:12, 13); </p>
<p>"of bloods" denotes those who are opposed to the goods of faith and of charity; "of the will of the flesh" denotes those who are in evils from the loves 
of self and of the world; "of the will of man" denotes those who are in falsities thence derived; to be "born of God" denotes to be regenerated. That no one can come into heaven unless he is regenerated, 
is taught in the same: </p>
<p>     Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of 
the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God (John 3:3, 5); </p>
<p>"to be born of water" denotes through the truth of faith; and "to be born of the spirit" denotes through the good of love. From all 
this it can now be seen who they are whose sins have been forgiven; and who they are whose sins have not been forgiven. </p>
<p>     EXODUS 25 </p>
<p>     1. And Jehovah spoke unto Moses, saying,      2. Speak 
unto the sons of Israel, and let them take for Me a collection; from every man whom his heart hath moved willingly ye shall take My collection.      3. And this is the collection which ye shall take 
from them; gold, and silver, and brass; </p>
<p>     4. And blue, and crimson, and scarlet double-dyed, and fine linen, and goats' wool; </p>
<p>     5. And skins of red rams, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood; </p>
<p> 
    6. Oil for the luminary, spices for the oil of anointing, and for the incense of spices; </p>
<p>     7. Onyx stones, and stones for filling, for the ephod, and for the breastplate.      8. And let 
them make for Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell in the midst of them.      9. According to all that I show thee, the form of the Habitation, and the form of all the vessels thereof, even so shall ye 
make it.      10. And let them make an ark of shittim wood; two cubits and a half the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.      11. 
And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, from within and from without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a border of gold round about.      12. And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for 
it, and put them upon the four corners thereof; and two rings shall be on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it.      13. And thou shalt make staves of shittim wood, and overlay them 
with gold.      14. And thou shalt put the staves into the rings on the sides of the ark, to carry the ark withal.      15. The staves shall be in the rings of the ark; they shall not be removed 
from it.      16. And thou shalt put into the ark the Testimony which I shall give thee.      17. And thou shalt make a propitiatory [mercy seat] of pure gold; two cubits and a half the length thereof, 
and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof.      18. And thou shalt make two cherubs, of solid gold shalt thou make them, at the two ends of the propitiatory [mercy seat].      19. And make one 
cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end; out of the propitiatory [mercy seat] shall ye make the cherubs upon the two ends thereof.      20. And the cherubs shall spread out their wings 
upward, covering with their wings over the propitiatory [mercy seat], and their faces a man's to his brother; toward the propitiatory [mercy seat] shall be the faces of the cherubs.      21. And thou 
shalt put the propitiatory [mercy seat] upon the ark from above; and unto the ark thou shalt put the Testimony that I shall give unto thee.      22. And there I will meet with thee, and I will speak 
with thee from above the propitiatory [mercy seat], from between the two cherubs which are over the ark of the Testimony, all that I shall command thee for the sons of Israel.      23. And thou shalt 
make a table of shittim wood; two cubits the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.      24. And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make 
thereto a border of gold round about.      25. And thou shalt make unto it a closure of a hand-breadth round about, and thou shalt make a border of gold for the closure thereof round about.      26. 
And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the four corners that are on the four feet thereof.      27. Over against the closure shall the rings be, for houses for the staves 
to carry the table.      28. And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, and the table shall be carried with them.      29. And thou shalt make the little dishes 
thereof, and the cups thereof, and the salvers thereof, and the little brooms thereof, with which it shall be covered; of pure gold shalt thou make them.      30. And thou shalt set upon the table 
the bread of faces, unto My faces continually.      31. And thou shalt make a lampstand of pure gold; solid shall the lampstand be made, its shaft, and its reed; its cups, its pomegranates, and its flowers, 
shall be out of it; </p>
<p>     32. And there shall be six reeds going out of the sides thereof; three reeds of the lampstand out of the one side thereof, and three reeds of the lampstand out of the 
other side thereof; </p>
<p>     33. Three almond-shaped cups in one reed, a pomegranate and a flower; and three almond-shaped cups in one reed, a pomegranate and a flower; so for the six reeds going out of 
the lampstand.       34. And in the lampstand four almond-shaped cups, its pomegranates and its flowers.      35. And a pomegranate under two reeds out of it, and a pomegranate under two reeds out 
of it, and a pomegranate under two reeds out of it, for the six reeds going out of the lampstand.      36. Their pomegranates and their reeds shall be out of it, all of them, one solid of pure gold.  
    37. And thou shalt make the lamps thereof seven; and it shall make its lamps go up, to give light over against the faces of it.      38. And the tongs thereof, and the basins thereof, shall be 
of pure gold.      39. A talent of pure gold shall it be made, with all these vessels.      40. And see and make them in the form which thou wast made to see in the mountain. </p>

These mercies are what is meant in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
As many as received Him, to them He gave power to be sons of God, to those believing in His name, who were born, not of blood,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> nor of the will of the flesh, 
nor of the will of man (vir), but of God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:12, 13</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Those born 'of blood' are people who are opposed to forms of the good of faith and charity, 'of the will of the flesh' those who are immersed 
in evils springing from self-love and love of the world, and 'of the will of man' those who are steeped in falsities arising from those evils. Being 'born of God' means being regenerated. The truth 
that no one can enter heaven unless he is being regenerated is stated in the same gospel,  </p>
<blockquote>
Truly, truly I say to you, Unless a person is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God. Truly, truly 
I say to you, Unless a person has been born of water and the spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:3,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3:3, 5</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Being born of water' means through the truth of faith, and 'being born of 
the spirit' through the good of love. All this now makes it clear who exactly they are whose sins have been forgiven, and who exactly they are whose sins have not been forgiven.  <A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> lit. bloods  </p>
