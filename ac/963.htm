<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第963节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>963.</strong>一种常见的惩罚形式是“面纱叠加”：遭受这类惩罚的人受制于幻觉，通过这幻觉，他们似乎在一个延伸得相当远的面纱下面。这面纱就象紧紧附着的云，并且云的厚度随着幻觉而增加。在面纱之下，他们在强烈欲望的爆发刺激下，以各种速度四处奔跑，直到筋疲力尽。这通常会持续差不多一个小时，并照着渴望挣脱的程度而伴随着不同程度的折磨。这种面纱是为了那些虽然看到真理，却由于我欲不愿承认它，并为真理应当这样而不断感到愤怒的精灵。有些人在面纱下面感到如此焦虑和恐惧，以致他们对于解脱的所有可能性感到绝望。有一个人从那个地方被释放出来，这一切是他告诉我的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]963.</strong> One of the more common penalties involves throwing a shroud over a spirit. In it, spirits gain the impression, from delusions they have brought on themselves, that they are under a shroud stretching far out around them. It is like a blanket of fog that thickens as they fantasize about it. Ablaze with the desire to break loose, they run back and forth under it at varying speeds until they grow exhausted. The experience usually lasts an hour, more or less, and entails pain of different kinds, depending on the intensity of their eagerness to free themselves.<br />The shroud is the lot of those who see the truth but still do not want to admit to it, because they love themselves, and who take constant offense that the truth should be what it is.<br />Some of the people under the shroud feel such anxiety and terror that they lose hope of ever gaining their freedom, as one who escaped once told me. </p>

Among punishments a frequent one consists in the throwing over the sufferers of a veil, and is as follows. By means of phantasies that are impressed on them the sufferers seem to themselves to be under 
a veil that is stretched out to a great distance. It is like a closely clinging cloud that increases in density in proportion to the phantasy, and under which, incited by the desire to burst out of 
it, they run hither and thither at various rates of speed, until they are wearied out. This usually lasts for the space of an hour, more or less, and is attended with different degrees of torment in 
proportion to the degree of the desire for extrication. The veil is for those who although they see the truth, yet under the influence of the love of self are unwilling to acknowledge it, and feel constant 
indignation that the truth should be so. When under the veil some feel such anxiety and terror that they despair of the possibility of their deliverance, as I was informed by one who had himself 
been delivered from it. </p>

A frequent form of punishment is 'the superimposing of the veil', which is this: Through the delusions to which those suffering such punishment are subject, they seem to themselves to be beneath a veil 
which extends quite a distance. It is like a clinging cloud which thickens in proportion to the delusion. Beneath the veil they scurry this way and that in a burning desire to break out, doing so at 
varying speeds until they are exhausted. This usually goes on for an hour, more or less, the accompanying torment varying according to the degree of desire to break loose. The veil is for spirits who, 
though they see the truth, are nevertheless unwilling because of self-love to acknowledge it, and are continually angry that the truth should be so. Such is the anxiety and dread experienced by some 
beneath the veil that they despair of all possibility of being set free. This I was told by one who had been set free from that place. </p>

</p><b>963.</b>
Inter punitiones frequens est 'superinjectio veli'; hoc tale est quod per phantasias sibi impressas videantur sibi sub velo in multam distantiam extenso esse; est quasi nubes cohaerens, quae densatur 
secundum phantasiam; sub illo discurrunt huc illuc, accensa cupidine inde erumpendi, velocitate diversa usque dum defatigati sunt; hoc perstare solet per horae spatium, magis aut minus, et fit cum cruciatu 
diverso secundum gradum cupiditatis se extricandi.  Velum est pro illis, qui tametsi vident veritatem, usque tamen non volunt agnoscere, ex amore sui, et indignantur continue quod ita sit.  Quidam 
sub velo habent talem anxietatem et terrorem ut desperent num usquam liberari possint; quod mihi dicebat quidam qui liberatus inde. </p>
