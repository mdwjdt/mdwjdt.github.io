<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2328节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2328.</strong>创世记19:2. 说，看哪，我主啊，请你们转到仆人家里，住一夜，洗洗脚，清早起来再赶路。他们说，不，我们要在街上过夜。<br />“说，看哪，我主啊”表对主的神圣人性和神圣活动的一种内在承认和表白。“请你们转到仆人家里，住一夜”表邀请到他家里作客。“请你们转到仆人家里”表居于仁之善。“洗洗脚”表适应其属世层。“清早起来再赶路”表以这种方式得以巩固在良善与真理中。“他们说，不”表质疑，这在试探期间是很常见的。“我们要在街上过夜”表祂可以说愿意通过真理审判。</p>

Verse 2. And he said, Behold I pray my lords, turn aside I pray to the house of your servant, and pass the night, and wash your feet; and in the morning ye shall rise and go on your way; and they said, 
Nay, for we will pass the night in the street. "And he said, Behold I pray my lords," signifies an interior acknowledgment and confession of the Lord's Divine Human and Holy proceeding; "turn aside 
I pray to the house of your servant, and pass the night," signifies an invitation to have an abode with him; "to the house of a servant," means in the good of charity; "and wash your feet," signifies 
application to his natural; "and in the morning ye shall rise and go on your way," signifies confirmation thereby in good and truth; "and they said, Nay," signifies a doubting, which is wont to attend 
temptation; "for we will pass the night in the street," signifies that He was as it were willing to judge from truth. </p>

Verse 2 And he said, Behold now, my Lords, turn aside now to your servant's house and spend the night, and wash your feet. And in the morning you may rise up and go your way. And they said, No, for we 
will spend the night in the street. </p>
<p>'And he said, Behold now, my Lords' means interior acknowledgement and confession of the Lord's Divine Human and His Holy proceeding. 'Turn aside now to your servant's 
house and spend the night' means an invitation to stay with him -'to your servant's house' means abiding in the good of charity. 'And wash your feet' means accommodation to his natural. 'And 
in the morning you may rise up and go your way' means being strengthened in this way in good and truth. 'And they said, No' means the doubting which is usually present during temptation. 'For we will 
spend the night in the street' means that He was willing, so to speak, to judge from truth. </p>

Vers. 2.  Et dixit, Ecce quaeso Domini mei, declinate quaeso ad domum servi vestri, et pernoctate, et lavate pedes vestros, et mane eatis, et eatis in viam vestram; et dixerunt, Non, quia in platea 
pernoctabimus. `Et dixit, Ecce quaeso Domini mei' significat interiorem agnitionem et confessionem Divini Humani et Sancti procedentis Domini: `declinate quaeso ad domum servi vestri, et pernoctate' significat 
invitationem ut apud se mansionem habeat; `ad domum servi vestri' est in bono charitatis: `et lavate pedes vestros' significat applicationem ad ejus naturale: `et mane surgatis, et eatis in 
viam vestram' significat confirmationem sic in bono et vero: `et dixerunt, Non' significat dubitationem quae solet esse tentationis: `quia in platea pernoctabimus' significat quod ex vero quasi vellet 
judicare. </p>
