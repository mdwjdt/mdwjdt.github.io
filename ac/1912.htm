<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1912节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1912．创世记16:5.</strong> 撒莱对亚伯兰说，我因你受屈，我将我的婢女放在你怀中，她见自己有了孕就小看我，愿耶和华在你我中间判断。<br />“撒莱对亚伯兰说”表对真理的情感如此直觉。“我因你受屈，我将我的婢女放在你怀中”表它不愿承受任何责备。“她见自己有了孕”表理性的最初生命。“就小看我”和前面一样，在此表这理性在孕育时就轻视与良善联结的真理本身。“愿耶和华在你我中间判断”表主的义愤。</p>

Verse 5. And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee; I gave my handmaid into thy bosom, and she saw that she conceived, and I am despised in her eyes; Jehovah judge between me and thee. "Sarai 
said unto Abram," signifies that the affection of truth so perceived; "My wrong be upon thee; I gave my handmaid into thy bosom," signifies unwillingness to take blame to itself; "and she saw that she 
conceived," signifies the first life of the rational; "and I am despised in her eyes," signifies here as before that this rational at its conception lightly esteemed truth adjoined to good; "Jehovah 
judge between me and thee," signifies the Lord's indignation. </p>

Verse 5 And Sarai said to Abram, May the wrong done to me be on you! I gave my servant-girl into your bosom, and she saw that she had conceived, and I am despised in her eyes. May Jehovah judge between 
me and you! </p>
<p>'Sarai said to Abram' means that the affection for truth so perceived. 'May the wrong done to me be on you! I gave my servant-girl into your bosom' means its unwillingness to take any 
blame. 'And she saw that she had conceived' means the initial life of the rational. 'And I am despised in her eyes' means here, as previously, that at its conception this rational despised truth itself 
that was allied to good. 'May Jehovah judge between me and you!' means the Lord's righteous anger. </p>

Vers. 5.  Et dixit Sarai ad Abram, Injuria mea super te, ego dedi ancillam meam in sinum tuum, et vidit quod concepit, et vilis sum in oculis ejus, judicet Jehovah inter me et inter te. `Dixit Sarai 
ad Abram' significat quod affectio veri ita perceperit: `injuria mea super te, ego dedi ancillam meam in sinum tuum' significat quod illa non culpam in se accipere vellet: `et vidit quod concepit' significat 
vitam primam rationalis: `et vilis sum in oculis ejus' significat, hic ut prius, quod rationale hoc in conceptione sua vilipenderet ipsum verum adjunctum bono: `judicet Jehovah inter me et inter 
me significat indignationem Domini. </p>
