<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2771.</strong>创世记22:2.神说，带着你的儿子，你独生的儿子，你所爱的以撒，往摩利亚地去，在我所要指示你的一座山上，把他献为燔祭。<br />“神说，带着你的儿子”表从祂所生的神圣理性。“你独生的儿子，你所爱的”表全宇宙中独一无二的那一个，祂要藉此拯救人类。“以撒”表该理性的本质。“往摩利亚地去”表试探的地方和状态。“把他献为燔祭”表祂要将自己圣化为神性。“在一座山上”表神性之爱。“我所要指示你的”表如祂要发觉的。</p>

Verse 2. And He said, Take I pray thy son, thine only one, whom thou lovest, even Isaac, and get thee to the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I 
will tell thee of. "He said, Take I pray thy son," signifies the Divine rational begotten by Him; "thine only one, whom thou lovest," signifies the sole one in the universe by which He was to save the 
human race; "even Isaac," signifies its quality; "and get thee to the land of Moriah," signifies a place and state of temptation; "and offer him there for a burnt- offering," signifies that He should 
sanctify Himself to the Divine; "upon one of the mountains," signifies the Divine Love; "which I will tell thee of," signifies as He should perceive. </p>

Verse 2 And He said, Take now your son, your only one, whom you love, Isaac, and get you to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I tell you. 'He 
said, Take now your son' means the Divine Rational begotten from Him. 'Your only one, whom you love' means the 'only one' in the entire universe by which He was to save the human race. 'Isaac' means 
the essential nature of that Rational. 'And get you to the land of Moriah' means a place and state of temptation. 'And offer him there as a burnt offering' means that He was to sanctify Himself to the 
Divine. 'On one of the mountains' means Divine love. 'Of which I tell you' means as He would perceive. </p>

Vers. 2.  Et dixit, Accipe quaeso filium tuum, unicum tuum, quem amas, Jishakum, et vade tibi ad terram Moriah, et offer eum ibi in holocaustum, super uno montium, quem dico ad te. `Dixit, Accipe quaeso 
filium tuum' significat Divinum Rationale ab Ipso genitum: `unicum tuum, quem amas' significat solum in universo, quo salvaturus genus humanum: `Jishakum' significat quale ejus: `et vade tibi ad 
terram Moriah' significat locum et statum tentationis: `et offer eum ibi in holocaustum' significat quod sanctificaret ipsum Divino: `super uno montium' significat amorem Divinum: `quem dico tibi' significat 
sicut percepturus sit. </p>
