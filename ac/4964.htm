<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4964节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4964.</strong>“被带下埃及去”表被带下教会所拥有的记忆知识。这从“埃及”的含义清楚可知，“埃及”是指记忆知识，也就是总体上的记忆知识，如前所述（<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>，<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>节）；但尚未解释“埃及”严格来说所表示的记忆知识是何性质。古教会有教义知识，也有记忆知识。教义知识涉及对神之爱和对邻之仁；而记忆知识涉及自然界与灵界的对应关系，以及属灵和属天事物在属世和尘世事物中的代表。这就是那些在古教会之人的记忆知识。<br />埃及是古教会所在的那些地区和国家之一（<a href="1238.htm">1238</a>，<a href="2385.htm">2385</a>节）；但由于在埃及，代代相传的，主要是记忆知识，所以“埃及”就表示总体上的记忆知识。也正因如此，圣言的预言部分经常论及埃及，“埃及”尤表这种知识。而且，埃及人的巫术也源于此，因为他们熟悉自然界和灵界的对应关系，后来，当他们中间的教会走向尽头时，这些对应关系因转变为巫术而被滥用。由于他们拥有这类知识，也就是教导对应关系，以及代表和有意义符号的知识，并且这些知识服务教会的教义事物，尤其服务于对他们圣言中所说的那些话的理解（古教会也有一部圣言，既预言性的，也有历史性的，类似于今天的圣言，然而这却是一部不同的圣言，对此，可参看<a href="2686.htm">2686</a>节），所以“被带下埃及去”表示被带下教会所拥有的记忆知识。<br />由于“约瑟”代表主，而经上在此说约瑟“被带下埃及去”，故意思是说，当主荣耀祂的内在人，也就是使它变成神性时，祂首先充满吸收消化教会所拥有的记忆知识，然后从这种知识开始并利用这种知识向越来越内在的事物发展，最终甚至发展到那些神性事物。因为祂乐意照祂使人重生，也就是使他变得属灵所遵循的次序荣耀祂自己，也就是使祂自己变成神性（<a href="3138.htm">3138</a>，<a href="3212.htm">3212</a>，<a href="3296.htm">3296</a>，<a href="3490.htm">3490</a>，<a href="4402.htm">4402</a>节）。也就是说，从外在事物，即记忆知识和信之真理逐渐发展到内在事物，即对邻之仁和对主之爱的观念。由此明显可知下面这些话是什么意思：<br />当以色列尚为孩童时，我就爱了他，就从埃及召出我的儿子来。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何11.1.htm">11:1</a>）<br />这些话论及主（参看马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太2.15.htm">2:15</a>）。</p>

Was brought down to Egypt. That this signifies to the memory-knowledges [scientifica] of the church is evident from the signification of "Egypt" as being memory-knowledge (that is, memory-knowledge in 
general), treated of in n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462; but what the nature of that memory-knowledge was which is properly signified by "Egypt," has not as yet been explained. In the Ancient Church there 
were doctrinal things and there were memory-knowledges. The doctrinal things treated of love to God and of charity toward the neighbor; but the memory-knowledges treated of the correspondences of the 
natural world with the spiritual world, and of the representatives of spiritual and celestial things in things natural and earthly. Such were the memory-knowledges of those who were in the Ancient Church. 
 [2] Egypt was one of those countries and kingdoms where the Ancient Church was (1238, 2385); but as in Egypt it was chiefly memory-knowledges that were handed down to posterity, therefore such 
knowledge in general is signified by "Egypt;" and it is for this reason also that Egypt is so often treated of in the prophetic Word, and by it such knowledge is specifically meant. The very magic of 
the Egyptians also had its origin thence; for they were acquainted with the correspondences of the natural world with the spiritual, and afterward, when the church among them was at an end, these correspondences 
were abused by being turned to magical things. Now because they had such knowledges (that taught correspondences, and also representatives and significatives) and as these knowledges were 
of service to the doctrinal things of the church, especially to the understanding of those things which were said in their Word (that the Ancient Church had a Word both prophetic and historic, similar 
to the present Word, but yet a different one, can be seen in n. 2686); therefore by "being brought down to Egypt" is signified to the memory-knowledges of the church. [3] As the Lord is represented 
by Joseph, its being here said that Joseph was "brought down to Egypt," signifies that when the Lord glorified His internal man, that is made it Divine, He was first imbued with the memory-knowledges 
of the church, and from and by them advanced to things more and more interior, and at last even to those which are Divine. For it pleased Him to glorify Himself, that is, to make Himself Divine, according 
to the same order as that in which He regenerates man, that is, makes him spiritual (n. 3138, 3212, 3296, 3490, 4402), namely, from external things, which are memory-knowledges and the truths of 
faith, successively to internal things, which are of charity toward the neighbor and of love to Him. From this it is plain what is signified by the following words in Hosea: </p>
<p>	When Israel was a child, 
then I loved him, and called My son out of Egypt (Hos. 11:1); </p>
<p>that these words were spoken of the Lord can be seen in Matthew 2:15. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4964</b></p><p><b>4964.</b>
'Was made to go down to Egypt' means to factual knowledge which the Church possessed. This is clear from the meaning of 'Egypt' as knowledge, or factual knowledge in general, dealt with in <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>, <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>. But no explanation of the essential nature of that factual knowledge properly meant by 'Egypt' has been provided as yet. In the Ancient Church there was doctrinal knowledge and there was 
factual knowledge. Doctrinal knowledge had regard to love to God and charity towards the neighbour, whereas factual knowledge had to do with the correspondences of the natural world with the spiritual 
world, and with the representations of spiritual and heavenly realities within natural and earthly ones. Such was the factual knowledge of those in the Ancient Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Egypt was one of those 
parts of the world and one of those kingdoms where the Ancient Church also existed, <a href="1138.htm">1138</a>, <a href="1385.htm">1385</a>; but since in that land mainly factual knowledge was handed down from one generation to another, 'Egypt' 
means factual knowledge in general. This also explains why frequent reference is made to Egypt in the prophetical part of the Word, where that knowledge is meant specifically by 'Egypt'. What is more, 
the actual magic practised by the Egyptians had its origin in the same knowledge; for they were acquainted with the correspondences of the natural world with the spiritual, and at a later time, after 
the Church among them had come to an end, they misused these in magical practices. Now because such factual knowledge existed among them - that is to say, knowledge which taught correspondences, and 
also representatives and meaningful signs - and because this factual knowledge was the servant of the doctrinal teachings of the Church, especially in their understanding of things stated in their Word 
(for the Word of the Ancient Church was both prophetical and historical, like the Word that exists today, though this is a different Word, see <a href="2686.htm">2686</a>) 'he was made to go down to Egypt' consequently means 
made to go down to the factual knowledge which the Church possessed. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Because the Lord is represented by 'Joseph' and the words 'Joseph was made to go down to Egypt' are used here, the meaning 
is that when the Lord was to glorify His Internal Man, that is, make it Divine, He first of all assimilated the factual knowledge possessed by the Church. Then, starting from and using that knowledge 
He advanced towards things increasingly interior and at length even to those that were Divine. For it pleased Him to glorify or make Himself Divine in conformity with the same kind of order as that 
by which He regenerates the human being or makes him spiritual, <a href="3138.htm">3138</a>, <a href="3212.htm">3212</a>, <a href="3296.htm">3296</a>, <a href="3490.htm">3490</a>, <a href="4402.htm">4402</a>. That is to say, there is a gradual advance from external ideas, which are known facts and the truths of faith, 
towards internal ones, which are ideas of charity towards the neighbour and of love to Him. From this one may see what is meant by the following words in Hosea,  </p>
<blockquote>
When Israel was a boy I loved 
him, and out of Egypt I called My son. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%2011:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 11:1</a>.  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
These words refer to the Lord, see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%202:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 2:15</a>.

`Descendere factus Aegyptum':  quod significet ad scientifica quae Ecclesiae, constat ex significatione `Aegypti' quod sit scientia, seu scientificum in communi, de qua n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462; 
sed quale id scientificum {1}fuit quod per `Aegyptum' proprie significatur, nondum explicatum est. In Antiqua Ecclesia fuerunt doctrinalia et fuerunt scientifica; doctrinalia agebant de amore in Deum 
et de charitate erga proximum, scientifica autem de correspondentiis mundi naturalis cum mundo spirituali, et de repraesentativis (t)spiritualium et caelestium in naturalibus et terrestribus; haec 
fuerunt scientifica illorum qui in Ecclesia Antiqua;  [2] Aegyptus fuit inter illas regiones et inter illa regna ubi etiam Antiqua Ecclesia fuit, n. 1238, 2385, sed quia ibi {2}imprimis scientifica 
tradebantur, idcirco per `Aegyptum' significatur scientificum in genere; et ideo quoque in Verbo prophetico toties de Aegypto agitur, et ibi tale scientificum per illam in specie intelligitur; 
ipsa magia Aegyptiaca etiam inde originem habuit; noverunt enim correspondentias naturalis mundi cum spirituali, quibus dein postquam Ecclesia apud illos cessavit, ad magica abusi sunt. Quia nunc 
talia scientifica apud illos fuerunt, nempe quae docebant correspondentias, et quoque repraesentativa et significativa, et quia haec inserviebant doctrinalibus Ecclesiae, imprimis ad intelligendum 
illa quae in Verbo illorum dicta fuerunt (quod Verbum Antiquae Ecclesiae fuerit tam propheticum quam historicum, simile huic Verbo sed aliud, videatur n. 2686), inde est quod per `descendere factus 
Aegyptum' significentur ad scientifica quae Ecclesiae.  [3] Quia Dominus per `Josephum' repraesentatur, et hic dicitur quod `Josephus descendere factus sit Aegyptum', significatur quod Dominus cum 
Internum Suum Hominem glorificaret, hoc est, Divinum faceret, primum imbuerit scientifica Ecclesiae, et ab illis et per illa progressum fecerit ad interiora magis et magis, et tandem usque ad Divina; 
placuit enim Ipsi secundum talem ordinem {3}Se Ipsum glorificare seu Divinum facere, secundum qualem hominem regenerat seu spiritualem facit, n. 3138, 3212, 3296, 3490, 4402, nempe ab externis 
quae sunt scientifica et vera fidei, successive ad interna quae sunt charitatis erga proximum et amoris in Ipsum. Inde patet quid significatur per haec verba apud Hosheam,      Cum puer Israel, tunc 
amavi illum, et ex Aegypto vocavi filium      Meum, xi 1; </p>
<p>quod haec de Domino, videatur Matth. ii 15. @1 fuerit placed after significatur$  @2 non ita doctrinalia tradebantur sicut alibi, sed scientifica$ 
 @3 Seipsum$  </p>
