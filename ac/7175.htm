<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7175节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7175.</strong>过了一段时间，水星居民中的一个女人被指给我看。她的脸很漂亮，但比我们地球女人的脸要小；她身材也更苗条，不过个子一样高。她头戴一块亚麻布，虽不美观，但很整洁。我还看见来自该星球的一个男人，他同样比我们地球的男人身材苗条。我所看见的这个男人身穿一件贴身的深蓝色衣服，两边没有褶皱。不过，这个星球的居民很少思想肉体，这一点通过以下事实向我显明：当进入来世成为灵人时，他们不像我们地球灵那样想要显为人，而是想显为水晶球。他们之所以想如此显现，是因为他们可以远离物质观念；此外，在来世，非物质事物的知识以水晶来代表。</p>

After some time there was shown me a woman of the inhabitants of the earth Mercury; she had a beautiful face, but it was smaller than that of a woman of our earth; she was also more slender, but of equal 
height. She wore linen on her head, put on without art, yet becomingly. I also saw a man from that earth, who likewise was more slender in body than the men of our earth; he who appeared was clad 
in a garment of dark blue, closely fitted to his body, without folds or prominences on either side. But that the inhabitants of that earth think little about their bodies, was evident to me from the 
fact that when they come into the other life, and become spirits, they do not wish to appear as men, like the spirits of our earth, but as crystal balls. The reason they desire so to appear is that they 
may remove from themselves material ideas; moreover the knowledges of things immaterial are represented in the other life by crystals. </p>

After some time I was shown a woman from among the inhabitants of the planet Mercury. She had a beautiful face, though it was smaller than that of a woman belonging to our planet; she was also slimmer, 
but the same height. On her head she wore a piece of linen, arranged not artistically but nevertheless tidily. A man too from that planet appeared before me; he also had a slimmer body than men belonging 
to our planet have. The man I saw was clothed in a dark blue garment, close fitting without any tucks or pleats here and there. The inhabitants of that planet give little thought to their bodies, 
as was clear to me from the fact that when they enter the next life and become spirits they do not wish to appear as people, as spirits belonging to our planet do, but as globes made of crystal. The 
reason why they wish to look like this is in order that they may banish material ideas from themselves. For knowledge about non-material things is represented in the next life by rock crystals. </p>

Post aliquod tempus ostensa (t)fuit mihi una femina incolarum telluris Mercurii; illa erat pulchra facie at minor facie quam feminae nostrae telluris, gracilior etiam, sed altitudine aequali; capite 
erat amicta linteo non arte posito sed usque decenter.  {1}Vir etiam mihi visus est ex tellure illa, qui etiam erat corpore graciliore quam sunt {2}viri nostrae telluris; ille qui apparuit indutus erat 
veste obscure caerulea, ad corpus stricte aptata absque plicis et prominentiis hinc illinc.  Ast quod incolae illius telluris parum cogitent de corpore suo, constabat mihi ex eo quod cum in alteram 
vitam veniunt (c)et fiunt spiritus, tunc non apparere velint ut homines, sicut spiritus nostrae telluris, sed {3}ut globi crystallini; quod ita apparere velint, est ut removeant a se ideas materiales, 
et quoque cognitiones rerum immaterialium repraesentantur in altera vita per {4}crystalla. 	@1 Homo$ 	@2 homines$ 	@3 sicut$ 	@4 d chrystalla i vitram chrystallina$ </p>
