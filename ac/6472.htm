<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6472.</strong>这两种生命，即来自主的思维之生命和意愿之生命是何性质，我已通过启示得知。也就是说，我被指示，主以两种方式流入，即：间接经由天堂，直接从祂自己；祂从自己既流入人心智的理性层，就是他的内层事物，也流入其心智的属世层，就是他的外层事物。从主流入的，是爱之良善和信之真理，因为从主发出的，是含有神性良善在里面的神性真理。但人接受它们的方式却各不相同，也就是说，他的独特个性决定了它们如何被接受。<br />主不强迫人去接受从祂自己所流入的东西，而是在自由中引导他；在此人允许的情况下通过自由把他引向良善。因此，主照他的快乐，也照他的幻觉和由此产生的错误设想而引导他；不过，主会逐渐把他从这些东西中引导出来；在此人看来，好像是他把自己引导出来的。因此，主不破碎这些东西，因为这会侵犯此人的自由；然而，为叫此人能得以改造，自由必须存在（参看<a href="1937.htm">1937</a>，<a href="1947.htm">1947</a>，<a href="2875.htm">2875</a>，<a href="2876.htm">2876</a>，<a href="2881.htm">2881</a>，<a href="3145.htm">3145</a>，<a href="3146.htm">3146</a>，<a href="3158.htm">3158</a>，<a href="4031.htm">4031</a>节）。主以这种方式流入人，即：不仅间接经由天堂，还直接从祂自己流入人心智的内层和外层；这是一个至今不为人知的奥秘。</p>

How the case is with the influx of each life, namely, of the life of the thought and the life of the will from the Lord, has been given to know by revelation; namely, that the Lord inflows in two ways: 
through heaven mediately, and from Himself immediately; and that from Himself He flows both into man's rational things, which are his interior things, and into his natural things, which are his exterior 
ones. That which flows in from the Lord is the good of love and the truth of faith, for that which proceeds from the Lord is the Divine truth in which is the Divine good; but these are variously 
received with man, namely, in accordance with his quality. [2] The Lord does not compel man to receive what flows in from Himself; but leads in freedom, and so far as man allows, through freedom leads 
to good. Thus the Lord leads man according to his delights, and also according to fallacies and the principles received therefrom; but gradually He leads him out from these; and this appears to the 
man as if it were from himself. Thus the Lord does not break these things, for this would be to do violence to freedom, which however must needs exist, in order that the man may be reformed (see n. 1937, 
1947, 2875, 2876, 2881, 3145, 3146, 3158, 4031). That the Lord flows in with man in this manner, namely, not only mediately through heaven, but also immediately from Himself, both into the interior 
and the exterior things in the man, is a secret hitherto unknown. </p>

The nature of the influx of both kinds of life - the life of thought and the life of the will coming from the Lord - has been made known to me through revelation. That is to say, I have been shown that 
the Lord flows in in two ways - indirectly by way of heaven, and from Himself directly - and that the influx from Himself is both into the rational levels of a person's mind, which are his interior 
ones, and into the natural levels of it, which are his exterior ones. What flows in from the Lord is the good of love and the truth of faith, for what goes forth from the Lord is Divine Truth holding 
Divine Good within it. But the way a person receives them varies, that is to say, his particular character determines how they are received. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The Lord does not compel a person to accept what flows 
in from Himself but leads him in freedom; and so far as the person allows He leads him by means of freedom to good. Thus the Lord leads a person in accordance with his delights. He also leads him 
in accordance with his illusions and resulting false assumptions; but from these He gradually leads him away, though it seems to the person as though he leads himself away. Thus the Lord does not shatter 
those assumptions, for that would violate the person's freedom, which must of necessity exist if a person is to be reformed, <a href="1937.htm">1937</a>, <a href="1947.htm">1947</a>, <a href="2875.htm">2875</a>, <a href="2876.htm">2876</a>, <a href="2881.htm">2881</a>, <a href="3145.htm">3145</a>, <a href="3146.htm">3146</a>, <a href="3158.htm">3158</a>, <a href="4031.htm">4031</a>. The fact that the 
Lord flows into a person in this way - not only indirectly by way of heaven, but also from Himself directly, both into the interior levels of a person's mind and into the exterior ones - is an arcanum 
that has remained unknown up to now. </p>

Quomodo se habet cum influxu utriusque vitae, nempe vitae cogitationis et vitae voluntatis a Domino, hoc scire datum est per revelationem, quod nempe Dominus influat duplici modo, nempe per caelum mediate 
et ex Se immediate, et {1}quod ex Se influat tam in rationalia hominis quae sunt interiora ejus, quam in naturalia ejus quae sunt exteriora; quod influit a Domino est bonum amoris et verum fidei, 
nam quod procedit a Domino, est Divinum Verum in quo Divinum Bonum; [2] sed haec varie recipiuntur apud hominem, nempe secundum quale ejus; Dominus non cogit hominem ad recipiendum quod a Se influit, 
sed ducit in libero, et quantum {2}sinit homo, per liberum ducit ad bonum; (m)ita Dominus ducit hominem secundum ejus jucunda, (x)tum quoque secundum fallacias et inde capta principia, sed sensim inde 
educit; et hoc apparet homini sicut a se; ita Dominus non frangit illa, nam hoc foret violare liberum,(n) quod tamen necessario erit, ut homo reformari possit, n. 1937, 1947, 2875, 2876, 2881, 3145, 
3146, 3158, 4031.  Quod Dominus ita influat apud hominem, nempe non solum mediate per caelum, sed etiam immediate ex Se tam in interiora quam in exteriora apud hominem, est arcanum hactenus ignotum. @1
