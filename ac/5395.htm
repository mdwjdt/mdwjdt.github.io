<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5395节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5395.</strong>有些人活着不是为自己的国家及其社区提供有用的服务，只是为了他们自己。他们不以公务为乐，只喜欢得到荣光、受人尊敬，这是他们寻求职务的目的。另外，他们还以吃、喝、游戏和社交活动为乐，然而却没有其它目的，只为自己高兴。在来世，这些人绝无可能留在善灵的团体，更不会在天使当中。因为对善灵和天使来说，有用的服务或功用才是他们快乐的源头；他们所提供的服务或功用决定了他们所得快乐的量和质。事实上，主的国无非是有用服务或功用的国；即便在地上的国，每个人也是照其功用而受到重视和尊敬，天国更是这种情况！那些只为自己和自己的快乐活着，没有任何有用目的之人也在臀部之下，照其快乐和目的的种类而在不洁之物中消磨时光。</p>

There are some who live not for the sake of any use to their country or to its communities, but with a view to live for themselves, taking no delight in public employments, but only in being honored 
and courted (to which end they indeed seek office); and also in eating, drinking, making merry and conversing with no other end than pleasure. Such in the other life cannot possibly be in the company 
of good spirits, still less in that of angels; for with these the use causes the delight, and according to the uses is the amount and quality of the delight. For the Lord's kingdom is nothing but a kingdom 
of uses; and if in an earthly kingdom everyone is valued and honored according to his use, how much more is this the case in the heavenly kingdom! They who have lived solely for themselves and pleasure, 
without any useful end, are also under the buttocks, and pass their time in things unclean in accordance with the kinds of their pleasures and their ends. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5395</b></p><p><b>5395.</b>
There are some who live not for the sake of any useful service they may render to their country and its communities, only for themselves. They find no delight in the holding of offices, only in being 
honoured and respected, which is why they seek office. In addition they take delight in eating, drinking, games, and social intercourse, yet for no other reason than their own pleasure. In the next life 
these people cannot by any means remain in groups of good spirits, let alone among angels. For with good spirits and angels useful service is the source of their delight; and the services they perform 
determine the amount and the essential nature of the delight they receive. For the Lord's kingdom is nothing else than a kingdom of useful services. Since in an earthly kingdom the extent to which 
anyone is esteemed and honoured is determined by the useful purpose he serves, how much more must this be so in the case of the heavenly kingdom. Those who have lived solely for themselves and their 
own pleasure, without any useful purpose in view, are also beneath the buttocks; and in keeping with the types of pleasure they have sought and with their ends in view they spend their time in filth. </p>

</p><b>5395.</b>
Sunt qui non propter aliquem usum patriae nec societatum ibi, sed propter sibi, nihil jucundi habentes in officiis sed solum in honorari et coli, propter quem finem etiam officia ambiunt, et praeterea 
in edere, bibere, ludere, conversari, ob nullum alium quam voluptatis finem; illi in altera vita nullatenus interesse possunt consortiis bonorum spirituum, minus angelorum; apud hos enim usus facit 
jucundum, et secundum usus quoque est eis quantum et quale {1} jucundi; regnum enim Domini non est nisi quam regnum usuum; cum in regno terrestri quisque aestimatur {2} et honoratur secundum usum, quid 
non in regno caelesti?  Illi qui vixerunt {3} solum sibi et voluptati, absque fine alius usus, etiam sub natibus sunt, et secundum voluptatum species et fines, degunt in sordibus. </p>
