<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1475节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1475.</strong>“求你说，你是我的妹子”表智性真理，就是“妹子”。这从“妹子”的含义清楚可知，“妹子”表智性真理，而“妻子”则表属天真理，对此，后面会进一步说明。这些事是这样的：知识的性质就是只渴望将自身引入属天之物，并探究它们；但是，这违反次序，因为以这种方式使用知识会对属天之物造成暴力。正确的次序是：属天之物藉着属灵之物将自身引入理性，再以这种方式进入知识，使这知识适应它自己。除非遵循这样的次序，否则不可能有任何智慧。本节经文还包含以下奥秘：主如何照着全备的次序被祂的父所教导；因而祂的外在人如何与祂的内在人结合，即祂的外在人如何变成神性，如内在人那样；因此，祂如何在两个本质（人性本质和神性本质）方面变成耶和华。这一切通过作为手段的认知实现。没有作为手段的认知，外在人甚至无法成为真正的人。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1475.</strong> The symbolism of please say you are my sister as intuitive truth, which is a sister, can be seen from the symbolism of a sister as intuitive truth, when heavenly truth is a wife. More will be said about this symbolism below.{*1} The situation is this: Secular knowledge by its very nature wants nothing more than to thrust itself into heavenly affairs and explore them, but this goes against proper procedure, since it means doing violence to heavenly matters. The proper procedure is for a heavenly idea to insert itself by means of a spiritual idea into our rational thinking and by means of this into some fact that we know, and to fit the fact to its purposes. If this procedure is not followed, no wisdom is at all possible.<br />This verse again holds secrets about the way the Lord's Father taught him in a completely orderly way. Consequently it also holds secrets about the way his outer self united with his inner, that is, the way his outer self became divine, just like his inner self, so that he became Jehovah in regard to both of his essential qualities.{*2} This was accomplished through religious concepts, which are a means. Without these concepts as a means, a person's outer self could not even become human.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For more on the intuitive truth symbolized by a sister, see 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1475/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1495" target=_top>1495</a>.

Say, I pray, thou art my sister. That this signifies intellectual truth, which is a "sister," is evident from the signification of a "sister," as being intellectual truth when celestial truth is a "wife," 
concerning which hereafter. These things stand thus: it is the nature of memory-knowledge to desire nothing more than to introduce itself into celestial things and explore them; but this is contrary 
to order, for it thus does violence to celestial things. Order itself is that the celestial by means of the spiritual introduces itself into the rational, and thus into the memory-knowledge [in scientificum], 
and adapts this to itself; and unless this order is observed, there cannot possibly be any wisdom. In the passage before us are also contained the arcana as to how the Lord was instructed 
by His Father according to all order; and thus how His external man was conjoined with His internal, that is, how His external man was made Divine, like the internal; thus how He became Jehovah as to 
each essence; which was done by means of knowledges, which are the means. Without knowledges as means, the external man cannot even become man. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1475</b></p><p><b>1475.</b>
'Say, now, you are my sister' means intellectual truth, which is 'a sister'. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'sister' as intellectual truth when celestial truth is meant by 'wife', which meaning 
of 'sister' is shown further on. The implications here are as follows: Knowledge is of such a nature that it desires nothing more than to introduce itself into celestial things and examine them. But 
this is contrary to order, for if knowledge is used in this way it does violence to celestial things. The proper order is for the celestial to introduce itself by way of the spiritual into the rational 
and in this manner into factual knowledge, and to adapt this to itself. Unless this order is kept no wisdom can possibly exist. Also contained in the present section there are arcana as to how the 
Lord was taught by His Father according to order in its completeness, and so how His External Man was joined to His Internal - that is, how His external Man was made Divine, even as His Internal Man 
was essentially Divine, and so how He became Jehovah as regards both Essences This was accomplished by means of cognitions, which are the means. Without cognitions as means the external man cannot indeed 
become truly man. </p>

'Dic quaeso, soror mea tu': quod significet intellectuale verum, quod est 'soror,' constare potest a significatione 'sororis' quod sit intellectuale verum cum caeleste verum est 'uxor'; de qua ejus 
significatione in sequentibus.  Haec ita se habent: scientia talis est ut nihil magis cupiat quam se immittere in caelestia et illa explorare; sed hoc est contra ordinem, sic enim violat caelestia; ipse 
ordo est ut caeleste per spirituale se immittat in rationale et sic in scientificum, et id sibi adaptet; qui ordo nisi observetur, nusquam aliqua sapientia. Continentur (x)etiam hic illa arcana quomodo 
Dominus instructus est a Patre Ipsius secundum omnem ordinem, et sic quomodo Externus Ipsius Homo conjunctus sit Interno, hoc est, quomodo Externus Ipsius Homo similiter ac Internus factus Divinus, 
sic quoad utramque Essentiam Jehovah; quod factum per cognitiones quae sunt media; absque cognitionibus ut mediis, homo externus ne quidem fieri potest homo. </p>
