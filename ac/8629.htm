<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8629节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8629.</strong>有一个灵人从低地上来，到我跟前说，他听到我对其他灵人所说的话，但几乎不明白所说关于属灵生命和属灵之光的任何话。我问他是否愿意学习这些东西；可他说，他来不是为这个目的；我由此断定，他不愿意。他极其愚蠢。天使告诉我说，他活在世上时，是以学问而闻名的人之一。他很冷漠，这一点从他的呼吸明显感觉出来。这是一个标志，表明他在纯属世之光，根本不在属灵之光中看事物，因此他没有利用知识为自己打开通向天堂之光的道路，反而把它关闭了。</p>

A certain spirit ascending from the lower earth came to me and said that he had heard my conversation with the other spirits, but that he had understood scarcely anything that had been said about spiritual 
life and light. I asked him whether he wished to learn these things. He said he had not come with that intention; from which it might be inferred that he was unwilling. He was very stupid. The 
angels said that this man, during his life in the world, had been one of those who are celebrated for their learning. He was cold, as was plainly felt from his afflatus, which was a sign of merely natural 
light and of no spiritual light; thus that by means of the sciences he had not opened, but had closed for himself, the way to the light of heaven. </p>

A certain spirit rising up from the lower earth came to me and said that he had heard the things I had spoken to the other spirits, but that he had understood scarcely anything of what had been said 
about spiritual life and light. I asked him whether he wished to learn about those things; he said he had not come with the intention of doing so, from which I concluded that he did not wish to. He was 
extremely stupid. Angels told me that when he lived as a person in the world he had been one of those quite famous for their learning. He was a cold person, which I became clearly aware of from his 
breath. This was an indication that he saw things in merely natural and not at all in spiritual light, thus that knowledge served not to open but to close the way to the light of heaven for him. </p>

</p><b>8629.</b>
Quidam spiritus ex inferiore terra ascendens ad me venit, et dixit quod audiverit illa quae cum aliis spiritibus locutus sum, sed quod vix aliquid intellexerit quae dicta sunt de vita {1}et luce spirituali; 
interrogabatur num illa discere vellet; dicebat quod non eo animo venerit, ex quo concludi potuit quod non vellet; erat valde stupidus; dictum ab angelis quod ille cum in mundo vixit homo, fuerit 
inter celebratiores propter eruditionem; erat frigidus, quod ab afflatu manifeste sentiebatur, quod signum erat luminis mere naturalis, et nullius spiritualis, ita quod per scientias non aperuerit 
sed occluserit sibi viam ad lucem caeli. 	@1 spirituali ac coelesti$ </p>
