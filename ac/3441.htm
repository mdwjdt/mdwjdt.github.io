<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3441节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3441.</strong>“并要为我仆人亚伯拉罕的缘故”表由于主的神性人。这从“亚伯拉罕”的代表和“我仆人”的含义清楚可知：“亚伯拉罕”是指主的神性，也指祂的神性人（<a href="2833.htm">2833</a>，<a href="2836.htm">2836</a>，<a href="3251.htm">3251</a>节）；“我仆人”论及主时，是指神性人。不是说神性人是一个仆人，因为这神性人也是耶和华（<a href="1736.htm">1736</a>，<a href="2156.htm">2156</a>，<a href="2329.htm">2329</a>，<a href="2921.htm">2921</a>，<a href="3023.htm">3023</a>，<a href="3035.htm">3035</a>节），“我仆人”之所以表示神性人，是因为主藉着这神性人服侍人类。事实上，正是藉着这神性人，人才得救，因为若非主将人性与神性联结，以便人能以其心智仰望并敬拜主的人性，从而靠近神性，他绝不能得救。人与被称为“父”的神性本身联结是通过被称为子的神性人，因而通过主实现的，属灵之人将主理解为人性，而属天之人则将祂理解为神性本身。由此明显可知为何神性被称为仆人，即因为它服侍神性，以便人能接受祂自己，还因为它为了人类的救赎而服侍人类。<br />这就是“我仆人亚伯拉罕”所表示的，如诗篇：<br />祂仆人亚伯拉罕的种，祂所拣选雅各的子孙哪，你们要记念祂所行的奇妙作为和祂的奇事，并他口中的判语。祂打发祂的仆人摩西和祂所拣选的亚伦。祂记念祂的圣言和祂的仆人亚伯拉罕。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗105.5.htm">105:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗105.6.htm">6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗105.26.htm">26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗105.42.htm">42</a>）<br />此处“祂的仆人亚伯拉罕”表示主的神性人。就至高意义而言，“仆人以色列”、“仆人雅各”和“仆人大卫”同样表示主的神性人。“仆人以色列”表示主的神性人，以赛亚书：<br />惟你以色列我的仆人，雅各我所拣选的，我朋友亚伯拉罕的种；你是我从地极抓来的，从地角所召来的，且对你说，你是我的仆人，我拣选了你。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛41.8.htm">41:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛41.9.htm">9</a>）<br />此处“以色列我的仆人”在至高意义上是指属灵教会内在事物方面的主，“雅各”是指该教会外在事物方面的主。<br />祂对我说，你是我的仆人以色列，我必因你得荣耀。现在他说：“你作我的仆人，使雅各众支派复兴，使以色列中得保全的归回，尚为小事；我还要使你作外邦人的光，叫你施行我的救恩，直到地极。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.3.htm">49:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.6.htm">6</a>）<br />此处“仆人以色列，我必因你得荣耀”明显代表主的神性人。显然，祂被称为“仆人”是由于祂所履行的服务，因为经上说“你作我的仆人，使雅各众支派复兴，使以色列中得保全的归回”。<br />“我的仆人雅各”也表示主的神性人，这明显可见于以下经文，以赛亚书：<br />我要将暗中的宝物和隐密处的宝藏赐给你，因我仆人雅各、我所拣选以色列的缘故。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.3.htm">45:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.4.htm">4</a>）<br />此处“我仆人雅各、我所拣选以色列”表示主，“我仆人雅各”与教会的外在事物有关，“我所拣选以色列”与教会的内在事物有关。<br />“我仆人大卫”也表示主的神性人，以西结书：<br />我要从四围聚集以色列人。我的仆人大卫必作他们的王，众人必归一个牧人。他们必住在我赐给我仆人雅各的地上，他们和他们的子孙，并子孙的子孙，都永远住在那里。我的仆人大卫必作他们的首领，直到永远。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.21.htm">37:21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.24.htm">24</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.25.htm">25</a>）<br />“我的仆人大卫”明显表主的神性人（<a href="1888.htm">1888</a>节），并且是凭着“王”，就是此处的“大卫”（<a href="1728.htm">1728</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="3009.htm">3009</a>节）所表示的神圣真理而表主的神性人。相对于良善，真理本身也是仆人（参看<a href="3409.htm">3409</a>节）。正因如此，主自己称自己为那服务或服事的，马可福音：<br />你们中间，谁要为大，就必作你们的用人；在你们中间，谁要为首，就必作众人的仆人。因为人子来，并不是要受人的服事，乃是要服事人。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.43.htm">10:43</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.45.htm">45</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.26.htm">20:26</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.28.htm">28</a>）<br />路加福音：<br />是谁为大？是坐席的呢？是服事人的呢？岂不是坐席的么？然而，我在你们中间如同服事人的。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.27.htm">22:27</a>）</p>

For the sake of Abraham my servant. That this signifies from the Lord's Divine Human is evident from the representation of Abraham, as being the Lord's Divine, and also the Divine Human (n. 2833, 2836, 
3251); and from the signification of "my servant," when predicated of the Lord, as being the Divine Human; not that the Divine Human is a servant, because this also is Jehovah (n. 1736, 2156, 2329, 
2921, 3023, 3035), but because the Lord by this serves the human race; for by this man is saved, inasmuch as unless the Lord had united the Human to the Divine, so that man might be enabled with his 
mind to look upon and adore the Human of the Lord and thus have access to the Divine, he could not possibly have been saved. The conjunction of man with the Divine itself which is called the "Father" 
is through the Divine Human which is called the "Son"; thus through the Lord, by whom the spiritual man understands the Human, but the celestial man the Divine Itself. Hence it is evident why the Divine 
Human is called a "servant," namely, because it serves the Divine, in order that man may have access thereto, and because it serves mankind for their salvation. [2] This then is what is signified 
by "Abraham my servant" as also in David: </p>
<p>     Remember his marvelous works that He hath done, his wonders and the judgments of His mouth, O ye seed of Abraham His servant, ye sons of Jacob, His chosen 
ones. He sent Moses His servant, Aaron whom He hath chosen. He remembered the word of His holiness with Abraham His servant (Ps. 105:5-6, 26, 42); </p>
<p>where by "Abraham his servant" is meant the Lord 
as to the Divine Human. In like manner also the Lord as to the Divine Human is meant in the supreme sense by "Israel his servant," by "Jacob his servant," and by "David his servant"; by Israel his servant, 
in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Thou Israel my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham My friend; thou whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the wings thereof, 
and said unto thee, Thou art My servant, I have chosen thee (Isa. 41:8-9); </p>
<p>where "Israel my servant" in the supreme sense is the Lord in respect to the internal things of the spiritual church; and 
"Jacob" as to the external things of this church. Again: </p>
<p>     He said unto me, Thou art My servant Israel, in whom I will be glorified. It is a light thing that thou shouldest be My servant to raise 
up the tribes of Jacob, and to bring back the preserved of Israel; and I have given thee for a light of the Gentiles, that thou mayest be My salvation unto the end of the earth (Isa. 49:3, 6); </p>
<p>where 
"Israel, in whom I will be glorified," manifestly represents the Lord's Divine Human. That he is called "servant" from serving is manifest, for it is said, "that thou shouldest be My servant to raise 
up the tribes of Jacob, and to bring back the preserved of Israel." [3] That the Lord as to his Divine Human is meant also by "Jacob my servant" is evident in the following passage from Isaiah: </p>
<p>   
  I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, for Jacob My servant's sake, and Israel My chosen (Isa. 45:3, 4); </p>
<p>where by "Jacob My servant, and Israel My chosen" is 
meant the Lord, "Jacob My servant" having respect to the external things of the church, and "Israel My chosen" to the internal things of the church. [4] The same is also signified by "David my servant" 
in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     I will gather the sons of Israel from every side. My servant David shall be king over them; there shall be to them all one shepherd. They shall dwell upon the land which I have 
given unto Jacob My servant, and they shall dwell therein, they and their sons and their sons' sons even forever; and David My servant shall be their prince forever (Ezek. 37:21, 24-25). "David My servant" 
plainly denotes the Lord's Divine Human (n. 1888), and this from Divine truth, which is signified by "king," and here by "David" (n. 1728, 2015, 3009). That truth itself also is relatively a servant, 
may be seen above (n. 3409); and because it is so, the Lord Himself calls Himself one that serveth" or "ministereth," in Mark: </p>
<p>     Whosoever would become great among you shall be your minister; 
and whosoever would be first among you shall be servant of all. For the Son of man also came not to be ministered unto, but to minister (Mark 10:43-45; Matt. 20:26-28). And in Luke: </p>
<p>     Which is 
the greater, he that reclineth at meat, or he that ministereth? Is not he that reclineth at meat? But I am in the midst of you as he that ministereth (Luke 22:27). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3441</b></p><p><b>3441.</b>
'For the sake of Abraham My servant' means because of the Lord's Divine Human. This is clear from the representation of 'Abraham' as the Lord's Divine, and also His Divine Human, dealt with in <a href="2833.htm">2833</a>, <a href="2836.htm">2836</a>, <a href="3251.htm">3251</a>, and from the meaning of 'My servant', when used in reference to the Lord, as the Divine Human. Not that the Divine Human is a servant, for the Divine Human also is Jehovah, <a href="1736.htm">1736</a>, <a href="2156.htm">2156</a>, <a href="2329.htm">2329</a>, 
<a href="2921.htm">2921</a>, <a href="3023.htm">3023</a>, <a href="3035.htm">3035</a>, but 'My servant' means the Divine Human because by means of that Divine Human the Lord serves the human race. Indeed it is by means of the Divine Human that a person is saved, for 
unless the Lord had united the Human to the Divine so that man could with his mind behold and worship the Lord's Human, and in so doing approach the Divine, he could not possibly be saved. The joining 
of man to the Divine Himself, called the Father, is effected through the Divine Human, called the Son, and so through the Lord, by whom one who is spiritual understands the Human, but one who is celestial 
understands the Divine Himself. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 From these considerations it is evident why the Divine Human is called a servant, namely that it serves the Divine for the purpose of giving man access to 
Himself, and it serves the human race in their salvation. This then is what is meant by 'Abraham My servant', as also in David, Remember His marvellous acts that He has done, the signs and the judgements 
of His mouth, O seed of Abraham His servant, O sons of Jacob His chosen ones. He sent Moses His servant, Aaron whom He had chosen. He remembered His Holy word, with Abraham His servant. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20105:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 105:5</a>, 
<a href="6.htm">6</a>, <a href="26.htm">26</a>, <a href="42.htm">42</a>. </p>
<p>Here 'Abraham His servant' is used to mean the Lord's Divine Human. In a similar way the Lord's Divine Human is also meant in the highest sense by 'servant Israel', 'servant Jacob', and 
'servant David': </p>
<p> SERVANT ISRAEL </p>
<p>In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
You, Israel, My servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham My friend, you whom I took from the ends of the earth, and called from the 
extremities<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of it, and said to you, You are My servant, I have chosen you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2041:8,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 41:8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here, in the highest sense, 'Israel My servant' is the Lord in relation to </p>
<p>the internal aspects of the spiritual 
Church, and 'Jacob' to the external aspects of that Church. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
He said to me, You are My servant Israel in whom I will be rendered glorious. It is a light thing that You 
should be a servant to Me to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to bring back the preserved of Israel. And I have given You as a light of the nations, that You may be My salvation right to the ends of the 
earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2049:3,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 49:3, 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'servant Israel in whom I will be rendered glorious' clearly stands for the Lord's Divine Human. Plainly He is called 'a servant' from the service He performs, for it is 
said 'that You may be a servant to Me to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to bring back the preserved of Israel'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 SERVANT JACOB </p>
<p>In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will give you the treasures of darkness and 
the secret riches of hiding-places for the sake of My servant Jacob, and of Israel My chosen. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2045:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 45:3, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'servant Jacob' and 'Israel the chosen' are used to mean the Lord - 'servant Jacob' 
in relation to the external Church, 'Israel the chosen' in relation to the internal Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 SERVANT DAVID </p>
<p>In Ezekiel, </p>
<p>I will gather the children of Israel from all around. My servant David 
will be king over them, and they will all have one shepherd. They will dwell in the land which I gave to My servant Jacob. And they will dwell in it, they and their sons, and their sons' sons even for 
ever. And David My servant will be their pence for ever. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2037:21,%2024,%2025&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 37:21, 24, 25</a>. </p>
<p>'Servant David' clearly stands for the Lord's Divine Human, <a href="1888.htm">1888</a>, and does so by virtue of Divine Truth which is meant 
by 'the king', who is David in this case, <a href="1728.htm">1728</a>, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="3009.htm">3009</a>. Also, in relation to good truth itself is the servant, see <a href="3409.htm">3409</a>. This being so the Lord calls Himself one who serves or ministers, in Mark, </p>
<blockquote>
Whoever 
would be great among you must be your minister; and anyone who would be first among you must be the servant of all, even as the Son of Man did not come to be ministered to but to minister. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2010:43-45&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 10:43-45</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2020:26-28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 20:26-28</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
Who is the greater, one who sits at table or one who ministers? Is it not the one who sits at table? But I am in the midst of you as one who ministers. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2022:27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 22:27</a>.

nusquam potuisset salvari; conjunctio hominis cum Ipso Divino quod Pater vocatur, est per Divinum Humanum quod Filius; ita per Dominum, per Quem a spirituali homine intelligitur Humanum, sed a
