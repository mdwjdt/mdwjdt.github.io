<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第918节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>918.</strong>“出了方舟”还象征自由的状态。这一点从前面有关“出方舟”（8:16）的论述清楚可知。属灵之人的自由所具有的性质从以下事实清楚看出来，即他被主藉着良知主导。凡被主藉着良知主导，即照良知行事的，就是在自由中行事。没有什么比违背良知行事更令他厌恶的了。对他来说，违背良知行事就是地狱，而照良知行事就是天堂。由此可见，照良知行事就是自由。主藉着对善与真的良知主导属灵之人。如前所述，这良知在其心智的觉知部分形成，因而与属于其意愿之物分离。由于它与其意愿之物彻底分离，故显而易见，人凭自己永远不会行出善事。既然一切信之真皆源于信之善，那么显然，人凭自己永远不会思想真理，而唯独通过主才能思想真理。诚然，他看似凭自己做这些事，但这只是表象。由于这是实情，所以真正的属灵之人承认的确如此。由此明显可知，被主赐予属灵之人的良知可以说是一个新意愿，因而人若重新受造，就会被赐予一个新意愿，由此被赐予一个新觉知。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]918.</strong> The fact that going out of the ark also involves a condition of freedom can be seen from remarks just above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_918/bible_king-james-version_genesis_8_16" target=_top>16</a> about going out of the ark [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_918/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_905" target=_top>905</a>].<br />The nature of a spiritual person's freedom is indicated by the fact that the Lord governs such people through conscience. Those whose conscience governs them, or who act in accord with their conscience, act freely. Nothing repels them more than violating their conscience. Acting against conscience is hell to them; obeying conscience is heaven. From this anyone can see that the latter is freeing.<br />The Lord governs spiritual people through a conscience that shows them what is good and true. This conscience, as noted [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_918/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_310#subsection-2-2" target=_top>310:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_918/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_393" target=_top>393</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_918/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_875#subsection-2-3" target=_top>875:3</a>], is formed in the intellectual part of their mind and so is separate from the contents of their will. Since conscience is totally separate from the urges of our will, we obviously can never do anything good on our own. And since all religious truth comes from religious good, we obviously never think anything true on our own, only under the Lord's power. The appearance that we do it on our own is only an appearance. Moreover, as this is how things work, a person who is truly spiritual also acknowledges and believes it.<br />From this it stands to reason that the spiritual person's conscience is a gift from the Lord, that it is like a new will, and therefore that the person who has been created anew is supplied with a new will and from this a new intellect. </p>

Went forth out of the ark. That this involves also a state of freedom, is evident from what was said above (at verse 16) about going out of the ark. The quality of the freedom of the spiritual man appears 
from the consideration that he is ruled by the Lord through conscience. He who is ruled by conscience, or who acts according to conscience, acts freely. Nothing is more repugnant to him than to 
act against conscience. To act against conscience is hell to him, but to act according to conscience is heaven to him; and from this anyone may see that acting according to conscience is freedom.  The 
Lord rules the spiritual man through a conscience of what is good and true; and this conscience is formed, as already said, in man's understanding, and is thus separated from what is of his will. And 
because it is wholly separated from what is of the will, it is very evident that man never does anything good of himself; and since all the truth of faith is from the good of faith, it is evident that 
man never thinks anything true from himself, but that this is from the Lord alone. That he seems to do these things from himself is only an appearance; and because it is so, the really spiritual man 
acknowledges and believes it. From this it is evident that conscience given to the spiritual man by the Lord is as it were a new will, and thus that the man who has been created anew is endowed with 
a new will and from this with a new understanding. </p>

'Going out of the ark' also embodies a state of freedom. This is clear from what has just been stated at verse 16 above about going out of the ark. The nature of the spiritual man's freedom becomes clear 
from the fact that he is governed by the Lord by means of conscience. Anyone who is governed by means of conscience, that is, who acts according to conscience, is acting in freedom. Nothing is more 
repugnant to him than acting contrary to conscience. For him acting contrary to conscience is hell, while acting according to it is heaven. From this anyone may see that acting according to it is freedom. 
The Lord governs the spiritual man by means of a conscience for good and truth. This conscience, as has been stated, is formed in the understanding part of his mind, and so separated from things 
belonging to his will. Now because it has been totally separated from the things of his will, it is perfectly clear that a person never performs anything good from himself. And since every truth of 
faith derives from the good of faith it is clear that a person never thinks anything true from himself, but does so from the Lord alone. He does indeed seem to do these things from himself, but that 
is only the appearance. Such being the reality of the situation, the truly spiritual man acknowledges and believes it to be so. From this it is evident that the conscience which the Lord grants to the 
spiritual man is so to speak a new will, and thus that a person who has been created anew is provided with a new will and from this with a new understanding. </p>

</p><b>918.</b>
Quod 'exire ex arca' etiam statum libertatis involvat, constat ex illis quae mox supra ad vers. 16 de exire ex arca dictum.  Qualis libertas hominis spiritualis sit, constare potest inde quod is per 
conscientiam regatur a Domino; qui per conscientiam regitur, seu qui secundum conscientiam agit, libere agit; nihil magis repugnat quam agere contra conscientiam; agere contra conscientiam ei est infernum, 
at agere secundum conscientiam ei est caelum; ex quo quisque videre potest quod hoc liberum sit.  Dominus hominem spiritualem regit per conscientiam boni et veri, quae, ut dictum, formata est in 
parte ejus intellectuali, et sic separata a voluntariis hominis; et quia prorsus separata est a voluntariis hominis, constare potest manifeste quod nusquam homo ex se faciat aliquod bonum; et quia omne 
verum fidei ex bono fidei est, constat quod nusquam homo a se cogitet aliquod verum, sed quod a Domino solo sit; quod videantur a se fieri, est solam apparentia; et quia ita se res habet, homo vere 
spiritualis etiam hoc agnoscit et credit. Inde patet quod conscientia homini spirituali a Domino donata, sit quasi nova voluntas, et sic quod homo qui e novo creatus est, praeditus sit nova voluntate 
et inde novo intellectu. </p>
