<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2398节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2398.</strong>创世记19:14. 罗得就出去，告诉将要娶他女儿的女婿们，说，你们起来离开这地方，因为耶和华要毁灭这城。但他在女婿们眼里却是开玩笑的。<br />“罗得就出去”表那些具有仁之善的人，以及仁之善本身。“告诉将要娶他女儿的女婿们”表连同那些被能与对良善的情感相联结的真理所主导的人。“说，你们起来离开这地方”表他们不能继续留在邪恶的状态。“因为耶和华要毁灭这城”表他们必要灭亡。“但他在女婿们眼里却是开玩笑的。</p>

Verse 14. And Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, that were to marry his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place, for Jehovah will destroy the city. And he was in the eyes of his sons-in-law 
as one that jested. "Lot went out," signifies those who are in the good of charity, and also the good itself of charity; "and spoke to his sons-in-law, that were to marry his daughters," signifies 
with those who were in truths, with which the affections of good could be adjoined; "and said, Up, get you out of this place," signifies that they should not remain in a state of evil; "for Jehovah 
will destroy the city," signifies that they must needs perish; "and he was in the eyes of his sons-in-law as one that jested," signifies derision. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2398</b></p><p><b>2398.</b>
Verse 14 And Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law who were marrying his daughters, and said, Rise up, go out of this place, for Jehovah is destroying the city. But he was in the eyes of his sons-in-law 
like one who was jesting. </p>
<p>'Lot went out' means people with whom the good of charity is present, and also means the good itself that flows from charity. 'He spoke to his sons-in-law who were 
marrying his daughters' means together with those governed by truths to which affections for good could be allied. 'And said, Rise up, go out of this place' means that they were not to remain in a state 
of evil. 'For Jehovah is destroying the city' means that they would inevitably perish. 'But he was in the eyes of his sons-in-law like one who was jesting' means cause for laughter. </p>

Vers. 14.  Et exivit Lot, et locutus est ad generos suos, accipientes filias suas, et dixit, Surgite, exite e loco isto, quia perdens Jehovah urbem; et fuit sicut ludens in oculis generorum ejus. `Exivit 
Lot' significat illos qui in bono charitatis, tum ipsum bonum charitatis; `locutus est ad generos suos accipientes filias suas' significat quod cum illis qui in veris quibus adjungi potuissent affectiones 
boni: `et dixit, Surgite, exite e loco isto' significat quod non manerent in statu mali: `quia perdens Jehovah urbem' significat quod non potuissent non perire: `et fuit sicut ludens in oculis 
generorum ejus' significat irrisionem. </p>
