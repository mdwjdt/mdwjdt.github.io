THE INTERNAL SENSE.      Verses 1-3*. If a thief be caught while digging through, and be smitten, and he die, bloods shall not be shed for him. If the sun have risen upon him, bloods shall be shed for 
him; repaying he shall repay; if he have nothing, he shall be sold for his theft. If finding the theft be found in his hand, from an ox even to an ass, even to one of the small cattle, living, he shall 
repay double. "If a thief be caught while digging through," signifies if it is not apparent that good or truth is being taken away; "and be smitten, and he die," signifies if then it is so injured 
as to be extinguished; "bloods shall not be shed for him," signifies that he is not guilty of the violence that is done; "if the sun have risen upon him," signifies if he shall see it clearly from within; 
"bloods shall be shed for him," signifies that he is guilty; "repaying he shall repay," signifies the amendment and restoration of the truth and good that have been taken away; "if he have nothing," 
signifies if nothing remains; "he shall be sold for his theft," signifies alienation; "if finding the theft be found in his hand," signifies if there be anything remaining of truth and good by which 
restoration can be made; "from an ox even to an ass," signifies whether from exterior good or truth; "even to one of the small cattle," signifies or from interior truth and good; "living," signifies 
in which there is spiritual life; "he shall repay double," signifies restoration to the full. * Verses 2 to 4 in the English Bible. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE  </p>
<p>Verses 2-4 If a thief is caught digging through<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and is struck, and he dies, there shall be no bloodguilt for him.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> If the sun has risen on him, there shall be bloodguilt for 
him - [the thief] must surely make repayment; if he has nothing, he shall be sold for his theft. If the theft is certainly found in his hand, whether it is ox or ass, or member of the flock,<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> [and they 
are] alive, he shall repay double.  </p>
<p>'If a thief is caught digging through' means if it is not apparent that good or truth is being taken away. 'And is struck, and he dies' means if in this situation 
harm is done to it, so great that it is wiped out. 'There shall be no bloodguilt for him' means that he is not guilty of the violence done. 'If the sun has risen on him' means if he sees it clearly 
from a more internal level. 'There shall be bloodguilt for him' means that he is guilty. '[The thief] must surely make repayment' means making amends and undertaking restoration for the truth or good 
that has been taken away. 'If he has nothing' means if nothing remains. 'He shall be sold for his theft' means alienation. 'If the theft is certainly found in his hand' means if any truth or good 
is left by means of which restoration can be made. 'Whether it is ox or ass' means whether it is exterior good or truth. 'Or member of the flock' means or it is interior truth and good. '[And they are] 
alive' means which have spiritual life within them. 'He shall repay double' means restoration to the complete amount.

SENSUS INTERNUS </p>
<p>Vers. 1-3.  Si in perfossione deprehensus fuerit fur, et percussus, et moriatur, non illi sanguines.  Si exortus fuerit sol super eo, sanguines illi, rependendo rependet; si nihil 
illi, et vendetur pro furto [suo].  Si inveniendo inventum fuerit in manu illius furtum, a bove usque ad asinum, usque ad pecudem, viventes, duplum rependet.  `Si in perfossione deprehensus fuerit fur' 
significat si non appareat quod bonum aut verum {1} auferatur: `et percussus, et moriatur' significat si tunc damno afficitur usque ut exstinguatur: `non illi sanguines' significat non reum violentiae 
illatae: `si exortus fuerit sol super eo' significat si viderit illud clare ex interiore: `sanguines illi' significat reum esse: `rependendo rependet' significat emendationem et restitutionem veri 
et boni ablati: `si nihil illi' significat si non aliquid supersit: `vendetur pro furto suo' significat abalienationem: `si inveniendo inventum fuerit in manu illius furtum' significat si ex vero et 
bono supersit per quod restitui possit: `a bove usque ad asinum' significat si ex bono aut vero exteriore: `usque ad pecudem' significat si ex vero et bono interiore: `viventes' significat quibus inest 
vita spiritualis: `duplum rependet' significat restitutionem ad plenum. @1 verum aut bonum$ </p>
