<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9149节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9149.</strong>“人若将银钱或器皿给同伴看守”表记忆中源于良善的真理，以及与它们相一致的记忆知识。这从“银钱”、“器皿”和“看守”的含义清楚可知：“银钱”是指源于良善的真理（参看<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="2954.htm">2954</a>，<a href="5658.htm">5658</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>，<a href="6917.htm">6917</a>，<a href="7999.htm">7999</a>，<a href="8932.htm">8932</a>节）；“器皿”是指记忆知识（参看<a href="3068.htm">3068</a>节），之所以表示相一致的记忆知识，是因为一切属灵真理都存在记忆知识里面，如同存在自己的器皿中（<a href="3079.htm">3079</a>节），一切记忆知识皆与它们所包含的真理相一致；“看守”是指保留在记忆中。就论述真理和记忆知识的灵义而言，“看守”表示被保存在记忆中，因为这是它们被安全保管的地方。“人将某物给同伴看守”表示将它存在他自己的记忆中，因为当字义论到两个不同的人，如在此论到人和同伴时，内义上所指的是一个人。事实上，两个真理，或说真理与符合它的记忆知识可以作为人和同伴存在于一个人里面。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9149</b></p><p><b>9149.</b>
When a man shall give to his companion silver or vessels to take care of. That this signifies truths from good and the corresponding knowledges in the memory, is evident from the signification of "silver," 
as being truth from good (see n. 1551, 2954, 5658, 6914, 6917, 7999, 8932); from the signification of "vessels," as being memory-knowledges (see n. 3068); that corresponding memory-knowledges are 
meant is because all spiritual truths are stored up in memory-knowledges as in their vessels (n. 3079); and all memory-knowledges correspond to the truths which are contained; and from the signification 
of "to take care of," as being to be in the memory; for in the spiritual sense, in which truths and memory-knowledges are treated of, "to be taken care of" denotes to be kept in the memory, because 
it is in this that such things are taken care of. "A man giving to his companion to take care of," denotes to store up within himself in the memory, for that which in the sense of the letter is said 
of one person and another, as here of a man and his companion, in the internal sense is understood of one; for two truths, as also a truth and the corresponding memory-knowledge, are in a human being 
as a man and his companion. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9149</b></p><p><b>9149.</b>
'When a man delivers to his companion silver or vessels for safe keeping' means truths derived from good, and factual knowledge that accords with them, in the memory. This is clear from the meaning of 
'silver' as truth derived from good, dealt with in <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="2954.htm">2954</a>, <a href="5658.htm">5658</a>, <a href="6914.htm">6914</a>, <a href="6917.htm">6917</a>, <a href="7999.htm">7999</a>, <a href="8932.htm">8932</a>; from the meaning of 'vessels' as factual knowledge, dealt with in <a href="3068.htm">3068</a>, the reason why accordant factual 
knowledge is meant being that all spiritual truths are stored within known facts as their vessels, <a href="3079.htm">3079</a>, and all factual knowledge accords with the truths it contains; and from the meaning of 'for safe 
keeping' as for retention in the memory. For in the spiritual sense, in which truths and factual knowledge are the subject, 'being placed in safe keeping' means being held in the memory, since this 
is where they are placed in safe keeping. 'A man's delivery of something to his companion for safe keeping' means storing it in his own memory; for when the sense of the letter speaks of two different 
persons, as it does here of a man and of a companion, one person is meant in the internal sense. For the two truths - or else truth and the factual knowledge that accords with it - can exist within a 
person as man and companion.  </p>

`Quando dederit vir socio suo argentum aut vasa ad custodiendum': quod significet vera ex bono et scientifica correspondentia in memoria, constat ex significatione `argenti' quod sit verum ex bono, 
de qua n. 1551, 2954, 5658, 6914, 6917, 7999, 8932; ex significatione `vasorum' quod sint scientifica, de qua n. 3068; quod sint scientifica correspondentia, est quia omnia vera spiritualia reconduntur 
{1} in scientificis ut in suis vasis, n. 3079; et omnia scientifica {2} correspondent veris quae continentur; et ex significatione `ad custodiendum' quod sit in memoria, nam `custodiri' in sensu spirituali, 
in quo agitur {3} de veris et de scientificis, est teneri in memoria, quoniam {4} in illa custodiuntur talia; `dare vir socio suo ad custodiendum' est reponere penes se in memoria, nam quod in 
sensu litterae dicitur de uno et (o)de altero, ut hic vir et socius, in sensu interno intelligitur de {5} uno, nam duo vera, ut et verum et scientificum correspondens {6}, sunt in homine vir et socius. @1
