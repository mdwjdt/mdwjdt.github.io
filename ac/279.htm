<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第279节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>279.</strong>综上所述，将这段经文连贯起来，就是：感官与属天之性颠倒（14节），主要降临世间，好将两者重新结合起来（15节），外在颠倒，产生冲突（16节），导致痛苦（17节）、罪责（18节），最后落入地狱（19节）。这些后果，一个接一个，从该教会第四代直到洪水发生。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]279.</strong> The idea involved, then, when all these verses are taken in sequence, is this: The sensory capacity turned away from the heavenly side (verse 14). The Lord was to come into the world to reunite the sensory and the heavenly (verse 15). Because the outer self turned away, conflict arose (verse 16), resulting in misery (verse 17), damnation (verse 18), and, in the end, hell (verse 19). These consequences followed one another in that church from the time of the fourth generation through to the Flood. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 279</b></p><p><b>279.</b>
All these verses then, taken in a series, involve that the sensuous part averted itself from the celestial (verse 14); that the Lord would come into the world for the purpose of reuniting them (verse 
15); that combat arose in consequence of the external man averting itself (verse 16); whence resulted misery (verse 17); condemnation (verse 18); and at length hell (verse 19). These things followed 
in succession in that church, from the fourth posterity down to the flood.      ______________________________      20. And the man [homo] called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all 
living.      21. And Jehovah God made for the man and for his wife coats of skin, and clothed them.      22. And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, knowing good and evil; and 
now lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of lives, and eat, and live to eternity,       23. Therefore Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which 
he was taken.      24. And He cast out the man; and He made to dwell from the east toward the garden of Eden cherubim, and the flame of a sword turning itself, to keep the way of the tree of lives. </p>

What all these verses in sequence embody is this: The sensory part turned away from what is celestial, verse 14. The Lord would come into the world to unite them, verse 15. Because the external man turned 
away, conflict resulted, verse 16. This led to wretchedness, verse 17, condemnation, verse 18, and at length hell, verse 19. These followed consecutively in that Church from the fourth generation 
down to the Flood.    </p>

Involvunt nunc omnes hi versus in serie, quod sensuale se averterit a caelesti, vers. 14: quod Dominus venturus in mundum, Qui uniret, vers. 15: quod, quia avertit se extemus homo, pugna inde, vers. 
16: quod miseria inde, vers. 17: quod damnatio inde, vers. 18: quod tandem infernum inde, vers. 19.  Haec successerunt in Ecclesia ista a quarta posteritate usque ad diluvium. *	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	* 	20. 
 Et vocavit homo nomen uxoris suae Havah, quia illa erit mater omnis viventis. 	21.  Et fecit JEHOVAH DEUS homini et uxori ejus tunicas pellis, et vestivit eos. 	22.  Et dixit JEHOVAH DEUS, 
Ecce homo fuit sicut unus e nobis, sciendo bonum et malum; et nunc forte mittet manum suam, et sumet etiam ab arbore vitarum, et edat, et vivat in aeternum. 	23.  Et emisit eum JEHOVAH DEUS ex horto 
Eden, ad colendum humum, ex qua sumptus. 	24.  Et ejecit hominem: et habitare fecit ab oriente ad hortum 'Eden cherubos; et flammam gladii vertentis se, ad custodiendum viam arbor is vitarum. </p>
