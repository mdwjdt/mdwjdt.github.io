<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4422节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">第34章</h4><br />最后的审判（续）<br />4422.本章头几节继续解释主在马太福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.42.htm">24:42</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.51.htm">51</a>）中的话。马太福音这一章的最后几节论述了世代的末了，或主的降临，字面上的内容如下：<br />所以，你们要警醒，因为你们不知道你们的主什么时候来到。但这一点你们要晓得：家主若知道几更天有贼来，就必警醒，不容人挖透房屋。所以，你们也要预备，因为你们想不到的时候，人子就来了。谁是忠心有见识的仆人，为主人所派，管理家里的人，按时分粮给他们呢？主人来到，看见他这样行，那仆人就有福了。我实在告诉你们：主人要派他管理自己的一切财产。倘若那恶仆心里说，我的主人必来得迟；就动手击打同做奴仆的，又和醉酒的人一同吃喝；在料想不到的日子，不知道的时辰，那仆人的主人要来，铲除他，定他和假冒为善的人同分。在那里必要哀哭切齿了。<br />从整个思路可以看出这些话所包含的内容，因为该福音书整个这一章所论述的主题是教会的末期，在内义上是世代的末了和主的降临。事实的确如此，这从对该章全部内容的解释明显可知，如从此前创世记各章的头几节可以看出来（即<a href="353.htm">353</a>-<a href="3356.htm">3356</a>，<a href="3486.htm">3486</a>-<a href="3489.htm">3489</a>，<a href="3650.htm">3650</a>-<a href="3655.htm">3655</a>，<a href="3751.htm">3751</a>-<a href="3757.htm">3757</a>，<a href="3897.htm">3897</a>-<a href="3901.htm">3901</a>，<a href="4056.htm">4056</a>-<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>，<a href="4229.htm">4229</a>-<a href="4231.htm">4231</a>，<a href="4332.htm">4332</a>-<a href="4335.htm">4335</a>节，就是创世记26-33章的头几节）。<br />该福音书的这一章所包含的思维顺序在这些章节也有所阐述，顺序如下：<br />（1）人们开始不知道何为良善与真理，并开始彼此争论它们。<br />（2）他们藐视它们。<br />（3）接着他们发自内心不承认它们。<br />（4）后来他们亵渎它们。<br />（5）由于信之真理和仁之良善仍存留在某些被称为“选民”的人当中，故将要描述的是那时的信之状态。<br />（6）然后描述的是仁之状态。<br />（7）最后论述的是一个新教会的开始。<br />（8）以及当这个教会被抛弃，一个新教会被采用时，在这个所谓教会中良善与真理的状态。<br />从这个思维顺序可以看出上面所列出的马太福音24章最后几节所包含的内容。也就是说，它们都是劝诫教会中人的话，即：他们要持守信之良善，否则，他们必灭亡。</p>

Genesis 34 </p>
<p>     THE LAST JUDGMENT </p>
<p>Prefatory to this chapter the Lord's words in Matthew 24, verse 42 to the end, remain to be unfolded. These words are the last in that chapter which treat of the 
consummation of the age, or the advent of the Lord, and which in the letter are these: Watch therefore, for ye know not what hour your Lord cometh. But know this, that if the master of the house had 
known in what watch the thief would come, he would assuredly have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken through. Therefore be ye also ready, for in an hour that ye think not the 
Son of man will come. Who therefore is the faithful and prudent servant, whom his lord hath set over his domestics, to give them their food in due season? Blessed is that servant whom his lord when 
he cometh shall find so doing. Verily I say unto you, that he will set him over all his goods. But if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth to come; and shall begin to beat his fellow 
servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken; the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour when he knoweth not, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint 
his portion with the hypocrites; there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. What these words involve may be seen from the series of things, for the subject treated of in this whole chapter of the 
evangelist is the last period of the church, which in the internal sense is the consummation of the age and the advent of the Lord. That this is the case is evident from the explication of all the contents 
of the chapter, as may be seen in the prefaces to the immediately preceding chapters of Genesis (namely, 26, n. 3353-3356; 27, n. 3486-3489; 28, n. 3650-3655; 29, n. 3751- 3757; 30, n. 3897-3901; 
31, n. 4056-4060; 32, n. 4229-4231; 33, n. 4332-4335). [2] What these contents are in a series has also been there stated, namely, that when the Christian Church that was set up after the Lord's 
coming began to vastate itself, that is, to recede from good, then: (1) They began not to know what good and truth are, but disputed about them. (2) They despised them. (3) Next they did not at heart 
acknowledge them. (4) Afterwards they profaned them. (5) And as the truth of faith and the good of charity were still to remain with some, who are called the "elect," the state of faith at that time is 
described. (6) And then the state of charity. (7) Lastly, the beginning of a new church is treated of; and, (8) The state as to good and truth within the so-called church, when that church is being 
rejected and a new church is being adopted. From this series it may appear what is involved in the words that have been transcribed above, and are the last of the chapter, namely, that they are words 
of exhortation to those in the church, that they should be in the good of faith, and that if not they must perish. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4422</b></p><p><b>4422.</b>
In the preliminary section of this chapter the Lord's words in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matthew%2024:42-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matthew 24:42-end</a> come up for explanation. These last verses in that chapter concerning the close of the age or the coming of the Lord read 
in the letter as follows, </p>
<p>Watch therefore, for you do not know at what hour your Lord is coming. But know this, if the master of the house knew at which period of the night the thief is coming, 
he would watch, and would not let his house be broken into. Therefore you also, be ready, for the Son of Man will come at an hour you do not expect. Who then is the faithful and careful servant, whom 
his master has set over his household, to give them food at the proper time? Blessed is that servant whom his master, when he comes, will find doing so. Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all 
his goods. But what if that wicked servant shall say in his heart, My master is delaying his coming, and he shall begin to beat his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with drunkards? The master of 
that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and in an hour he does not know. And he will cut him off and assign him his part with the hypocrites, where there is wailing and gnashing of 
teeth. </p>
<p>What these words hold within them may be seen from the train of thought, for the subject throughout this chapter in the gospel has been the last days of the Church, by which in the internal 
sense are meant the close of the age and the coming of the Lord. This can be seen plainly in the explanation of every statement in that chapter, in the preliminary sections of the chapters of Genesis 
immediately previous to this. That is to say, see <a href="3353.htm">3353</a>-<a href="3356.htm">3356</a>, <a href="3486.htm">3486</a>-<a href="3489.htm">3489</a>, <a href="3650.htm">3650</a>-<a href="3655.htm">3655</a>, <a href="3751.htm">3751</a>-<a href="3757.htm">3757</a>, <a href="3897.htm">3897</a>-<a href="3901.htm">3901</a>, <a href="4056.htm">4056</a>-<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>, <a href="4229.htm">4229</a>-<a href="4231.htm">4231</a>, and <a href="4332.htm">4332</a>-<a href="4335.htm">4335</a>, the preliminary sections of Chapters <a href="26.htm">26</a>-<a href="33.htm">33</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The sequence 
of thought contained in this chapter of the gospel has also been stated in those paragraphs, that sequence being as follows: When the Christian Church established after the Lord's Coming began 
to ruin itself, that is, to depart from good, </p>
<p><a href="1.htm">1</a> People ceased to know what good or truth was and began to argue with one another about them. </p>
<p><a href="2.htm">2</a> They treated them with contempt. </p>
<p><a href="3.htm">3</a> Then they did 
not in their hearts acknowledge them.  </p>
<p><a href="4.htm">4</a> After that they profaned them. </p>
<p><a href="5.htm">5</a> And because the truth of faith and the good of charity were still to remain in existence with some who are called the elect, 
the state of faith as this will be at that time is described. </p>
<p><a href="6.htm">6</a> Then the state of charity as this will be.  </p>
<p><a href="7.htm">7</a> Finally the beginning of a new Church is dealt with, and </p>
<p><a href="8.htm">8</a> The state of good 
and truth within the Church, so called, when that Church is set aside and the new one adopted. </p>
<p>From this sequence of thought one may come to see what is included within the final verses of Matthew <a href="24.htm">24</a>, which are set out above. That is to say, they contain an exhortation to those within the Church to keep to the good of faith or else they will perish. </p>

GENESEOS                       CAPUT TRIGESIMUM QUARTUM </p>
<p>Ante hoc caput veniunt explicanda verba Domini apud Matthaeum xxiv a vers. 42 ad finem, quae sunt ultima in illo capite de 
consummatione saeculi seu adventu Domini, quae sunt (o)haec in littera           Vigilate ergo, quia non scitis qua hora Dominus vester      venit {1}.  Illud vero scitote, quoniam {2} si sciret  
    paterfamilias, qua custodia {3} fur venit {4}, vigilaret      utique, et non sineret perfodi domum suam.  Propterea etiam      vos estote parati, quia qua hora non putatis, Filius hominis  
    veniet.  Quis ergo est fidelis servus et prudens, quem      constituit {5} dominus ejus super famulitium suum, ad dandum      {6} illis cibum in tempore? Beatus servus ille {7}, quem      veniens 
dominus ejus invenerit facientem ita.  Amen dico      vobis {8}, quod super omnia bona sua constituet {9} eum.  Si      vero dixerit malus servus ille in corde suo, Moratur dominus      meus 
venire, ceperitque {10} percutere conservos, edere vero      et bibere cum ebriosis.  Veniet dominus servi hujus in die      quo non exspectat, et in hora qua {11} non novit.  Et  dividet {12} eum, 
et partem ejus cum hypocritis ponet: ibi est planctus et stridor dentium. Quid haec involvunt, constare potest a serie rerum; actum enim est in toto hoc capite apud evangelistam de ultimo tempore 
Ecclesiae, quod in sensu interno est consummatio saeculi, et adventus Domini; </p>
<p>quod ita sit, ab explicatione omnium illorum quae in illo capite, patere potest, quae videantur in praemissis ante capita 
quae proxime praecedunt, nempe ante caput xxvi, n. 3353-3356; xxvii, n. 3486-3489; xxviii, n. 3650-3655; xxix, n. 3751-3757; xxx, n. 3897-3901; xxxi, n. 4056-4060; xxxii, n. 4229-4231; xxxiii, n. 4332-4335: 
[2] quid in serie continuerunt {13}, ibi etiam dictum est {14}, nempe, cum Ecclesia Christiana post adventum Domini instaurata se vastare inciperet, hoc est, recedere a bono,, (o)quod tunc 
I. Non inciperent scire quid bonum et verum, sed litigarent de illis: II. Quod contemnerent illa: III. Quod (o)dein non corde agnoscerent: IV. (o)Postea quod profanarent: V. Et quia adhuc permansurum 
verum fidei et bonum charitatis apud quosdam qui electi vocantur, describitur status fidei tunc: VI. Et dein status charitatis: VII. Demum agitur de initio novae Ecclesiae: et VIII. De statu 
quoad bonum et verum intra Ecclesiam sic dictam, cum illa rejicitur et nova adoptatur: ex hac serie constare potest quid illa verba quae supra exscripta sunt, et ultima illius capitis sunt, involvunt; 
quod nempe sint exhortationis ad illos qui in Ecclesia, ut in bono fidei sint, et {15} si non, quod perituri.      @In A S copied this passage exactly from Sch but later altered all words in
