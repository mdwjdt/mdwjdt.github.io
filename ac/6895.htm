<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6895节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6895.</strong>“说，我实在眷顾了你们”表祂降临到那些属于属灵教会的人那里。这从“眷顾”的含义清楚可知，“眷顾”（visiting，经上或译为降罚，追讨，刑罚等）是指先于教会末期的主的降临，在圣言中，这个时间被称为“最后的审判”。关于“眷顾”表示审判的这层含义，可参看前文（<a href="2242.htm">2242</a>，<a href="6588.htm">6588</a>节）。该审判被称为主的降临，这一点从马太福音中的这些话明显看出来：<br />门徒对耶稣说，请告诉我们，什么时候有这些事？你降临和时代的完结，有什么预兆呢？（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.3.htm">24:3</a>）<br />然后，主将教会的末期告诉门徒，这从前面的解释可以看出来（<a href="3353.htm">3353</a>-<a href="3356.htm">3356</a>，<a href="3486.htm">3486</a>-<a href="3489.htm">3489</a>，<a href="3897.htm">3897</a>-<a href="3901.htm">3901</a>，<a href="4056.htm">4056</a>-<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>，<a href="4229.htm">4229</a>-<a href="4231.htm">4231</a>，<a href="4422.htm">4422</a>-<a href="4424.htm">4424</a>节）。当这一切发生时，祂说：<br />那时，人子的兆头要显在天上，地上的众支派都要哀哭。他们要看见人子，有能力，有大荣耀，驾着天上的云降临。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.30.htm">24:30</a>）<br />“主的降临”不是指祂同天使驾着云出现，而是指人们通过爱和信从心里承认、接受祂（参看<a href="3353.htm">3353</a>，<a href="3900.htm">3900</a>节）；还有，祂从圣言的里面出现，圣言的至内或至高意义唯独论述主（<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>节）。这种降临才是当一个旧教会被废除，一个新教会被主建立时主的降临所指的。由于教会的一个新阶段现即将在雅各的后代中间建立，故经上说“我实在眷顾了你们”，就像约瑟临死时所说的那些话：<br />约瑟对他弟兄们说，我要死了；但神必定眷顾你们，领你们从这地上去，到祂起誓所应许给亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各之地。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创50.24.htm">50:24</a>）<br />就字义而言，“必定眷顾你们”在此表示从在埃及为奴役的状态中被解救出来，引入迦南地；然而，这不是圣言的属灵内容，而是属世内容。圣言的属灵内容论述主，祂的国度和教会，以及爱和信。因此，“实在眷顾”在灵义上表示从虚假中被解救出来，从而引入属于教会和主国度的事物，也就是说，主在爱与信中降临到那些将属于新教会的人中间。</p>

Saying, Visiting I have visited you. That this signifies His coming to those who are of the spiritual church, is evident from the signification of "visiting," as being the coming of the Lord, which precedes 
the last time of the church, which time in the Word is called the "Last Judgment." (That this is meant by "visitation," see n. 2242, 6588.) That this is called "the Lord's coming," is plain from 
these words in Matthew: </p>
<p>     The disciples said unto Jesus, Tell us when shall these things shall be? and what is the sign of Thy coming, and of the consummation of the age? (Matt. 24:3); </p>
<p>and then 
the Lord instructed the disciples about the last time of the church, as can be seen from what has been unfolded above (n. 3353-3356, 3486-3489, 3897-3901, 4056-4060, 4229-4231, 4422-4424); and He said 
that when all these things should come to pass, "then shall appear the sign of the Son of man, and then shall all the tribes of the earth wail, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds 
of heaven with power and glory" (Matt. 24:30). [2] That by the "coming of the Lord" is not meant His appearing with angels in the clouds, but acknowledgment in hearts by love and faith (see n. 3353, 
3900); also His appearing from the Word, the inmost or supreme sense of which treats of the Lord alone (n. 4060). This coming is meant by the coming of the Lord which takes place when an old church 
is rejected, and a new church is set up again by the Lord. And as newness of the church was now to be restored with the posterity of Jacob, it is said, "Visiting I have visited you," as was also said 
by Joseph when he died: </p>
<p>     Joseph said unto his brethren, I die; and visiting God will visit you, and will make you come up out of this land unto the land which He sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to 
Jacob (Gen. 50:24); </p>
<p>by "visiting to visit you," in the sense of the letter, is here signified liberation from slavery in Egypt, and introduction into the land of Canaan; but this is not the spiritual 
content of the Word, but the natural. The spiritual of the Word treats of the Lord, of His kingdom and church, and of love and faith; and therefore by "visiting to visit" in the spiritual sense is 
meant liberation from falsities, and thus initiation into what is of the Lord's church and kingdom, thus the coming of the Lord in love and faith with those who will be of the new church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6895</b></p><p><b>6895.</b>
'Saying, I have certainly visited you' means His coming to those who belong to the spiritual Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'visiting' as the Lord's coming, which precedes the final period 
of the Church, the period which is spoken of in the Word as a final judgement. Regarding the meaning of 'visitation' as that judgement, see <a href="2242.htm">2242</a>, <a href="6588.htm">6588</a>; and the fact that that judgement is called the 
Lord's coming is evident from the following words in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
The disciples said to Jesus, Tell us, when will those things take place, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the close of the 
age? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2024:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 24:3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord was telling the disciples then about the final period of the Church, as may be seen from the explanations given in <a href="3353.htm">3353</a>-<a href="3356.htm">3356</a>, <a href="3486.htm">3486</a>, <a href="3489.htm">3489</a>, <a href="3897.htm">3897</a>-<a href="3901.htm">3901</a>, <a href="4055.htm">4055</a>-<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>, <a href="4229.htm">4229</a>-<a href="4231.htm">4231</a>, <a href="4422.htm">4422</a>-<a href="4424.htm">4424</a>. He said that when all those things happen,  </p>
<blockquote>
The sign of the Son of Man will appear, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn; and they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds 
of heaven with power and glory. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2024:30&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 24:30</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 'The Lord's coming' is not used to mean His appearance together with angels in the clouds, but the acceptance of Him in people's hearts through 
love and faith, see <a href="3353.htm">3353</a>, <a href="3900.htm">3900</a>, and also His appearance from within the Word, the inmost or highest sense of which deals with the Lord alone, <a href="4060.htm">4060</a> This coming is meant by 'the Lord's coming', which takes 
place at the time when an old Church is done away with and a new one is established by the Lord. And because a new phase of the Church was to be established now among the descendants of Jacob, the 
words 'I have certainly visited you' are used, like those spoken by Joseph when he was about to die,  </p>
<blockquote>
Joseph said to his brothers, I am dying; and God will certainly visit you and cause you to go 
up out of this land to the land which He swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2050:24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 50:24</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Certainly visiting you' here means in the sense of the letter deliverance from slavery in Egypt and introduction 
into the land of Canaan. This however is not the spiritual subject matter contained in the Word but the natural. The spiritual subject matter in the Word has to do with the Lord, His kingdom and 
the Church, and love and faith. Consequently 'certainly visiting' is used to mean in the spiritual sense deliverance from falsities and thus introduction into things that belong to the Church and the 
Lord's kingdom, that is, the Lord's coming in love and faith among those who will belong to the new Church.  </p>

`Dicendo, Visitando visitavi vos': quod significet adventum Ipsius ad illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, constat ex significatione `visitare' quod sit adventus Domini, qui praecedit ultimum tempus Ecclesiae, 
quod tempus in Verbo ultimum judicium vocatur; quod `visitatio id sit, videatur n. 2242, 6588; quod id adventus Domini dicatur, patet ab his apud Matthaeum, Discipuli dixerunt ad Jesum, Dic 
nobis quando ista fient, quodnam signum Tui adventus, et consummationis saeculi, xxiv 3; </p>
<p>ac instruebat tunc Dominus discipulos de ultimo tempore Ecclesiae, ut constare potest ab illis quae n. 3353-3356, 
3486-3489, 3897-3901, 4056-4060, 4229-(x)4231, 4422-4424, explicata sunt; et dicebat quod cum omnia illa existerent, Appareret signum Filii hominis; et tunc plangent omnes tribus terrae, et videbunt 
Filium hominis venientem in nubibus caeli cum virtute et gloria, ibid. vers. 30; </p>
<p>2 quod per `adventum Domini' non intelligatur apparitio Ipsius cum angelis in nubibus, sed agnitio in cordibus per 
amorem et fidem, videatur n. 3353, 3900; tum {1}apparitio Ipsius e Verbo, {2}cujus sensus intimus seu supremus de solo Domino {3}agit, n. 4060; hic adventus intelligitur per `adventum Domini,' qui tunc 
fit quando Ecclesia vetus rejicitur et nova a Domino instauratur; et quia nunc apud posteros Jacobi novum Ecclesiae instauraretur, dicitur `visitando visitavi vos'; ut quoque a Josepho cum moreretur, Dixit 
Joseph ad fratres suos, Ego morior, et Deus visitando visitabit vos, et ascendere faciet vos e terra hac ad terram quam juravit Abrahamo, Jischako, et Jacobo, Gen. 1 24. Per `visitando visitare 
vos' in sensu litterae hic significatur liberatio a servitute in Aegypto, et introductio in terram Canaanem; sed hoc non est spirituale quod in Verbo sed est naturale; spirituale quod in Verbo agit 
de Domino, de Ipsius regno et Ecclesia, deque amore et fide, quapropter {4}`per visitando visitare' in sensu spirituali intelligitur liberatio a falsis, et sic initiatio in illa quae sunt Ecclesiae 
et regni Domini, ita adventus Domini in amore et fide apud illos qui ab Ecclesia nova erunt. 	@1 revelatio$ 	@2 nam in Verbi sensu intimo seu supremo$ 	@3 agitur AI$ 	@4 After spirituali$ </p>
