<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4096节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4096.</strong>“拉结和利亚回答雅各说”表对真理的情感的回应。这从“回答”的含义，以及“拉结和利亚”的代表清楚可知：当给予同意时，“回答”是指互相的事（<a href="2919.htm">2919</a>节）和接受（<a href="2941.htm">2941</a>，<a href="2957.htm">2957</a>节）；“拉结”是指对内层真理的情感，“利亚”是指对外在真理的情感（参看<a href="3758.htm">3758</a>，<a href="3782.htm">3782</a>，<a href="3793.htm">3793</a>，<a href="3819.htm">3819</a>节）。就此前几节的内义而言，所论述的主题一直是正与“拉班”所表示的居间良善分离时的属世层良善，该良善由“雅各”来表示，以及这属世层的良善如何与“拉结和利亚”所表示的真理情感联结。现在论述的主题则是在这些真理情感的良善方面的互相运用。这种运用就包含在拉结和利亚现在所说这些话的内义中。<br />不过，这些事具有这样的性质，它们不在任何人的理解范畴之内，除非他得到有关它们的教导，并以知道这类事为乐，因而以洞察属灵之事为目的。其他人则对这类事毫无兴趣，甚至都无法把心思用到它们上面。因为那些以世俗和尘世事物为目的的人，无法将自己的思维和感觉从这些事物中挣脱出来；即便挣脱出来，他们也不会在这类事上感觉到快乐；因为在这种情况下，他们会从他们以之为目的，也就是他们所爱的事物那里离开并退出。可以让具有这种性质的人自我检测一下，看看他是否愿意知道良善如何将它自己与对真理的情感联结起来，对真理的情感如何将它们自己运用于那良善，并且知道这一切是否让他心烦。那时，他会说，这类知识术语对他一点用处没有，他又不能从中得到什么东西。<br />但是，如果有人和他谈论与他在世上的生意有关的事，无论这些事多么复杂，或者他被告知另一人情感的性质，以及他如何能由此通过心理和口头上的迎和而与那人建立联系，那么他不但理解被告知的事，还能察觉它里面所含的进一步的想法。一个渴望并努力探索知识的深奥领域之人也一样。他喜欢观察，并且的确看到比刚才所提到的那人被告知之事里面的东西更复杂的事。但当提及属灵的良善与真理时，他却觉得它令人心烦，并背过身去。说这些事是为了让人们知道，如今的教会成员是什么样子。<br />至于通过情感将自己与真理联结的良善，和将自己运用于良善的真理，对它们的整个概念，在想象力或思维专注于良善与真理时，不如在它专注于这些良善与真理流入所经过的灵人和天使的社群时显得更清晰。因为如前所述（<a href="4067.htm">4067</a>节），人的意愿和思维出自这些社群，也就是从他们那里流入，看上去仿佛他们就存在于他里面。要知道这些灵人和天使社群所扮演的角色，就得知道真正的起因；要知道天使天堂所扮演的角色，就得知道这些起因后面的目的。还有一些历史细节补充进来，以说明这些事，使它们显得更清楚。<br />内义论述良善与真理联结，以及这些真理用于属世层里面的良善。因为如前面频繁所述，“雅各”是指属世层里面的良善，“他的妻子”是指对真理的情感。属于爱与仁的良善从主流入，并且通过与人同在的天使流入；但不流入任何其它事物，而是流入他的认知。由于良善固定在这些认知里面，所以思维便专注于他由此所知的真理上，许多与它们有关并和谐一致的事物就通过这些被唤起。这种活动会持续到此人认为事情的确如此，并出于情感意愿它，因为它是千真万确的。当到了这一步时，良善便将自己与真理联结起来，真理也自由地运用自己；因为一切情感皆带来自由（<a href="2870.htm">2870</a>，<a href="2875.htm">2875</a>，<a href="3158.htm">3158</a>，<a href="4031.htm">4031</a>节）。<br />即使到了这一步，已经与那人联结的灵人仍会激起怀疑，有时甚至激起否认。不过，情感越是占上风，他就越被引入肯定态度，同时通过这些怀疑和否认确认真理。当良善以这种方式流入时，就没有它经由天使而来的感觉，因为它通过内在途径流入，并进入其心智中因世俗和肉体兴趣而变暗的部分。不过，要知道，良善并非从天使流入，而是从主经由天使流入。所有天使都承认这一点，因此他们从不声称良善是他们的；当有人将其归给他们时，他们甚至会发怒。从这一切，如同从起因本身，可以看出良善与真理联结，以及这些真理将自己运用于良善，也就是此处在内义上所论述的主题是何情形。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4096</b></p><p><b>4096.</b>
And Rachel and Leah answered, and said unto him. That this signifies the reciprocity of the affections of truth, is evident from the signification of "answering" when assent is given, as being what is 
reciprocal (see n. 2919), and as being reception (n. 2941, 2957); and from the representation of Rachel, as being the affection of interior truth; and of Leah, as being the affection of external truth 
(see n. 3758, 3782, 3793, 3819). In the internal sense of what has gone before the subject treated of has been the good of the natural, which is signified by "Jacob," when it was being separated from 
the mediate good, which is "Laban," and how this good of the natural adjoined to itself the affections of truth, which are signified by "Rachel and Leah." The subject now treated of is the reciprocal 
application to good of these affections of truth. This application is contained in the internal sense of the words which Rachel and Leah now say. [2] But these things are of such a nature that they 
do not fall into any understanding except that which has been instructed, and which perceives delight in the memory-knowledge of such things, and which therefore has spiritual knowledges as its end. 
Others care nothing for such things, and cannot even apply their minds to them. For they who have worldly and earthly things as their end, cannot withdraw their senses from them; and even if they did 
so, they would perceive what is undelightful; in which case they would be departing and withdrawing from the things they have as their end, that is, which they love. Let anyone who is of such a nature 
put himself to the test, as to whether he desires to know how good adjoins itself to the affections of truth; and how the affections of truth apply themselves to good; and whether knowing this is irksome 
to him or not; and he will say that such things are of no benefit to him, and that he apprehends nothing about them.  [3] But if such things are told him as relate to his business in the world, 
even though they are of the most abstruse character, or if he be told the nature of another man's affections, and how he may thereby join the man to himself by adapting himself both mentally and orally, 
this he not only apprehends, but also has a perception of the interior things connected with the matter. In like manner he who studies from affection to investigate the abstruse things of the sciences, 
loves to look and does look into things still more intricate. But when spiritual good and truth are in question, he feels the subject irksome and turns his back on it. These things have been said 
in order that the quality of the existing man of the church may be known. [4] But how the case is with good when it adjoins truths to itself by affections, and with truths when they apply themselves 
to it, cannot so well appear when the idea or thought is directed to good and truth, but better when it is directed to the societies of spirits and angels through which these flow in; for as before 
said (n. 4067), man's willing and thinking come from these societies, that is, flow in from them, and appear as if they were in him. To know how the case herein is from the societies of spirits and angels, 
is to know it from causes themselves; and to know it from the heaven of angels is to know it from the ends of these causes. There are also historical things which adjoin themselves, and illustrate 
these things, causing them to appear more plainly.  [5] The internal sense treats of the adjunction of good to truths, and of the application of these latter, in the natural; for as often before said 
Jacob is the good in the natural, and his women are the affections of truth. The good which is of love and charity flows in from the Lord, and does so through angels who are with man; but not into 
anything else in him than his knowledges. And as good is there fixed, the thought is kept in the truths of the knowledges; and from these many things are called up which are related and are in agreement; 
and this until the man thinks that it is so, and until he wills it from affection because it is so. When this is being done, good conjoins itself with truths, and the truths apply themselves in freedom; 
for all affection causes freedom (n. 2870, 2875, 3158, 4031). [6] Even then, however, doubts and sometimes denials are excited by the spirits who have been joined to the man; but insofar as affection 
prevails, so far he is led to the affirmative, and he is then confirmed in truths by these very things. When good flows in in this manner, it is not perceived that it comes through angels, because 
it flows in so interiorly, and into the man's obscurity which he has from worldly and corporeal things. Be it known however that good does not flow in from the angels, but through the angels from 
the Lord; and this all the angels confess, and therefore they never claim for themselves any good, and are even indignant when anyone attributes it to them. From all this then, as from causes themselves, 
it may be seen how the case is with the adjoining of good to truths, and with the application of these latter, which are the subjects here treated of in the internal sense. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4096</b></p><p><b>4096.</b>
'Rachel answered, and Leah, and they said to him' means a reciprocation by the affections for truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'answering', when assent is being given, as that which is reciprocal, 
dealt with in <a href="2919.htm">2919</a>, and as receptivity, <a href="2941.htm">2941</a>, <a href="2957.htm">2957</a>; and from the representation of 'Rachel' as the affection for interior truth, and of 'Leah' as the affection for external truth, dealt with in <a href="3758.htm">3758</a>, <a href="3782.htm">3782</a>, <a href="3793.htm">3793</a>, <a href="3819.htm">3819</a>. In the sections previous to this the subject in the internal sense has been the good of the natural meant by 'Jacob' when it was being separated from intermediate good meant by 
'Laban', and how that good of the natural linked to itself the affections for truth which are meant by 'Rachel and Leah'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The subject now is the reciprocal application to good of those affections 
for truth. This application is contained in the internal sense of the words which Rachel and Leah utter now. But these matters are such that they do not come within the range of anyone's understanding 
unless he has been informed about them and takes delight in knowing about such things, and consequently has the discernment of spiritual matters as his end in view. All others have no interest at 
all in such matters and cannot even direct their minds towards them. For having worldly and earthly things as their end in view all others cannot detach their thoughts and feelings from those things; 
and if they did detach them they would not take any delight in doing so, for in that case they would be departing from and removing themselves from the things which they have as their end in view, that 
is, which they love. Let anybody like this put himself to the test, to see whether he has any wish to know how good links itself to affections for truth and how affections for truth apply themselves 
to that good, and whether knowing this irritates him or not. He will then say that such items of knowledge are of no use to him, and also that he does not get anything out of them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But if someone 
discusses with him the kind of things that are connected with his business in the world, no matter how very complex these matters may be, and he is told where another's affections lie and also how 
he can use these to draw that person to himself by bending his own mind and words in his direction, he not only grasps what he is told but also perceives further ideas within it. It is similar with 
one who desires and strives to investigate the abstruse areas of knowledge. He loves to look at, and does look at, more complicated things than those within what is told to the person just mentioned above. 
But when spiritual good and truth are referred to he finds it a bore and also turns away from it. These things have been stated so that people may know what the member of the Church is like at the 
present day. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 But the whole idea of good linking itself to truths by means of affections, and of truths applying themselves to good, is less clear when imagination or thought is focused on good 
and on truth than when it is focused on the communities of spirits and angels through which good and truth flow in. For as stated in <a href="4067.htm">4067</a>, that which man wills and thinks originates in these, that 
is, it flows in from them, and appears as if it existed within him. To know the part played by those communities of spirits and angels in this case is to know the actual causes; and to know the part played 
by the heaven of angels is to know the ends behind these causes. There are also the historical details which are added to illustrate the matter and so enable it to be seen more plainly. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In 
the internal sense the subject is the linking of good to truths, and the application of those truths to good within the natural. For as has often been stated, 'Jacob' is the good in the natural, and 
'his wives' affections for truth. Good which is the good of love and charity flows in from the Lord, doing so through the angels present with man. It does not flow into anything else with man than the 
cognitions discerned by him. And good being established in these, thought is concentrated on the truths thus known to him, and from these further things are aroused which are related to them and harmonize 
with them. And this activity continues until the person thinks that a thing is true and from affection wills it because it is true. When this point is reached the good joins itself to the truths 
and the truths apply themselves in freedom; for all affection leads to freedom, <a href="2870.htm">2870</a>, <a href="2875.htm">2875</a>, <a href="3158.htm">3158</a>, <a href="4031.htm">4031</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 But even when this point is reached, the spirits who have become linked to that person 
arouse doubts, and sometimes even denials. But insofar as affection prevails he is brought to an affirmative attitude and is at the same time confirmed in truths through those very doubts and denials. 
When good enters in this manner there is no perception of its doing so through angels, since it enters by such an interior way and passes into the parts of his mind that are darkened by worldly and bodily 
interests. But it should be realized that good does not flow in from angels but through them from the Lord. This all the angels also confess, and for that reason never claim that anything good is 
theirs; indeed they are angry when anyone attributes it to them. From all that has been said then, as from causes themselves, some idea may be had of what happens when good is linked to truths, and 
when these apply themselves to good, the subject at this point in the internal sense. </p>

`Respondit Rachel et Leah, et dixerunt ei': quod significet reciprocum affectionum veri, constat a significatione `respondere' cum annuitur, quod sit reciprocum, de qua n. 2919, et quod sit receptio, 
n. 2941, 2957; et ex repraesentatione `Rachelis' quod sit affectio veri interioris, et `Leae' quod sit affectio veri externi, de quibus n. 3758, 3782, 3793, 3819. In illis quae praecedunt, actum 
est in sensu interno de bono naturalis quod per `Jacobum' significatur, cum separaretur a bono medio, quod est `Laban,' quomodo illud, nempe bonum naturalis, adjungeret sibi affectiones veri, quae 
per Rachelem et Leam' significantur; [2] agitur nunc de applicatione affectionum veri reciproca ad bonum; haec applicatio continetur in sensu interno verborum quae Rachel et Leah nunc dicunt; sed 
haec talia sunt ut non cadant in intellectum nisi illum qui instructus est, et qui jucundum percipit in scientia talium, proinde qui pro fine habet spirituales cognitiones; ceteri nihil talia curant, 
et eo usque intendere mentem non possunt, qui enim pro fine habent mundana et terrestria, non abducere possunt inde sensus, et si abducerent, injucundum perciperent, nam tunc discederent et se 
removerent ab illis quae pro fine habent, hoc est, quae amant; experiatur quisque apud se qui talis, num scire velit quomodo bonum se adjungit affectionibus veri et quomodo affectiones veri se applicant, 
et annon hoc scire molestum ei, et dicturus quod talia ei non conducant, tum quod nihil de illis capiat; [3] at si talia ei dicuntur quae ejus negotii sunt in mundo, tametsi reconditissima 
sunt, et qualis alter sit quoad affectiones, tum quomodo per illas sibi illum adjungere possit, se applicando animo et dictis, hoc non modo capit, sed etiam interiora percipit: similiter qui abstrusa 
scientiarum indagare ex affectione studet, is intricatiora quam haec intueri amat et quoque intuetur; </p>
<p>at cum de spirituali bono et vero agitur, taedium sentit et quoque aversatur: haec dicta sunt 
ut sciatur qualis homo Ecclesiae hodie est.  [4] Sed quomodo se habet cum bono cum adjungit sibi vera per affectiones, et cum veris cum se applicant, non ita constare potest cum tenetur idea seu 
cogitatio in bono et in vero, sed melius cum in societatibus spirituum et angelorum per quas influunt, nam ut n. 4067 dictum est, hominis velle et cogitare inde venit, seu inde influit, et apparet 
sicut in illo: ex illis, nempe societatibus spirituum et angelorum, scire quomodo se res habet, est ex ipsis causis, et ex caelo angelorum, est ex finibus causarum, sunt etiam {1} historica quae se 
adjungunt, et illustrant, ita apparent manifestius: [5] in sensu interno agitur de adjunctione boni ad {2} vera, et de applicatione horum in naturali, `Jacob' enim est bonum ibi, ut saepius dictum, 
et `muliere' ejus' sunt affectiones veri; </p>
<p>bonum quod est amoris et charitatis, Domino influit, et quidem per angelos qui apud hominem, et non in alia apud hominem quam in cognitiones quae {3} apud 
illum; et quia ibi figitur bonum, tenetur cogitatio in veris quae sunt cognitionum et inde excitantur plura quae affinia sunt et convenientia, et hoc tam diu usque dum cogitat quod ita sit et usque 
dum vult quia ita est ex affectione; cum hoc fit, tunc conjungit se bonum veris, et applicant se vera, in libero, omnis enim affectio facit liberum, n. 2870, 2875, 3158, 4031: [6] sed cum hoc fit, 
etiam a spiritibus qui ei adjuncti sunt, excitantur dubia, quandoque etiam negativa, sed quantum affecti praevalet, tantum ad affirmativum ducitur, et simul tunc per illa i veris confirmatur: bonum 
cum sic influit {4}, non percipitur quod sit per angelos, quia influit ita interius et in obscurum ejus quod ei e mundanis et corporeis est: sed sciendum quod bonum non influat ab angelis sed per 
angelos a Domino; hoc fatentur etiam omnes angeli, quapropter etiam sibi nunquam {5} vindicant aliquod bonum, immo indignantur cum aliquis eis illud tribuit. Ex his nunc, ut ex ipsis causis, videri 
potest quomodo se res habet cum adjunctione boni a vera, et de horum applicatione, de quibus hic in sensu interno.      @1 i tunc$      @2 A d conjunctione... cum, i adjunctione... ad$      @3
