<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10729节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10729</strong>.“六日要作工”表一个人被主重生的第一个状态，以及至高意义上主之人身荣耀的第一个状态。这从“六日”的含义清楚可知，第七日或安息日之前要作工的“六日”是指一个人被主重生的第一个状态，就是一个人拥有真理，通过真理被引向良善并卷入争战时的状态（参看<a href="8510.htm">8510</a>，<a href="8888.htm">8888</a>，<a href="9431.htm">9431</a>，<a href="10360.htm">10360</a>节）。它还表示主在世用神性真理与地狱争战，使地狱和天堂里的一切事物都恢复秩序时，其人身的荣耀的状态（参看<a href="10360.htm">10360</a>节）。因为人在被主重生时，会经历两种状态；第一种状态存在于他拥有真理，并通过真理被引向良善之时，第二种状态存在于他拥有良善，并出于良善看到并热爱真理之时。在第一种状态下，诚然，此人被主引导，然而是通过他自己的东西被引导的；因为出于真理行动就是出于人里面的那些东西行动；而出于良善行动就是出于主行动。<br />由此明显可知，人在何等程度上允许自己被通过真理引向良善，就在何等程度上被主引导并引向主。因为结合在一起的一切事物都有作用和回应，作用的是良善，回应的是真理。然而，真理从来不会自动作出回应，只是被良善驱使作出回应。因此，只要真理接受良善，它就对良善作出回应；只要作出回应，它就与良善结合。由此也可推知，在一个人与主结合之前，主通过真理鞭策他朝向自己；只要此人允许自己被引导，他就与主结合。事实上，神的真理具有这样的性质：它们合乎良善，因为真理出自良善。此人由此拥有感知，而感知本身就是一种回应，或说本质上是一种回应的形式。允许自己被鞭策，或通过真理被引向良善，就是照真理生活。提及这些事是为了叫人们在某种程度上知道，“六日作工或劳碌”所表示的一个正在重生之人的第一个状态是怎么回事。</p>

Six days shall work be done. That this signifies the first state of the regeneration of man by the Lord, and in the supreme sense the first state of the glorification of the Lord's Human, is evident 
from the signification of the "six days" which precede the seventh or Sabbath, and in which work is to be done, as being the first state of the regeneration of man by the Lord, which state is when the 
man is in truths, and is led by means of truths to good, and is then in combats (see n. 8510, 8888, 9431, 10360. That it also denotes the state of the glorification of the Lord's Human while He was in 
the world and fought from Divine truth against the hells, and reduced all things there and in the heavens into order, may be seen in n. 10360.) For man has two states while he is being regenerated by 
the Lord. The former is when he is in truths, and is being led by means of truths to good. The latter is when he is in good, and from good sees and loves truths. In the former state the man is indeed 
led by the Lord, but by means of what is his own. For to act from truths is to act from those things which are with man; but to act from good is to act from the Lord. From this it is evident that insofar 
as a man suffers himself to be led by means of good to truths, so far he is led by the Lord and to the Lord.  [2] For there is action and reaction in all things that are conjoined. The agent is 
good, and the reagent is truth. But truth never reacts from itself; but from good, consequently insofar as truth receives good, so far it reacts; and insofar as it reacts, so far it is conjoined with 
good. From this it also follows that before a man is being conjoined with the Lord, the Lord impels him to Himself by means of truths; and insofar as the man suffers himself to be brought to Him, so 
far he is conjoined. For truths Divine are of such a nature that they can be fitted to good, because truths come forth from good. From this the man now has perception, which in itself is a reacting. To 
suffer one's self to be impelled [agi], or brought to good by means of truths, is to live according to them. These things have been said in order that it may in some measure be known how the case is 
in regard to the first state of the man who is being regenerated, which is signified by the "six days of labor." </p>

'Six days shall work be done' means the first state in the regeneration of a person by the Lord, and in the highest sense the first in the glorification of the Lord's Human. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'six days' - which come before the seventh or the sabbath, and during which work must be done - as the first state in the regeneration of a person by the Lord, a state when a person is in possession 
of truths and is being led by means of them towards good, and is engaged in conflicts, dealt with in <a href="8510.htm">8510</a>, <a href="8888.htm">8888</a>, <a href="9431.htm">9431</a>, <a href="10360.htm">10360</a>. As regards its further meaning as a state in the glorification of 
the Lord's Human when He was in the world, employing Divine Truth to fight the hells, and restoring all things there and in the heavens to a state of order, see <a href="10360.htm">10360</a>. There are two states which a person 
passes through while being regenerated by the Lord; the first exists when he is in possession of truths and is being led by means of them towards good, the second when he is in possession of good 
and from good sees and loves truths. In the first state the person is, it is true, being led by the Lord, yet by means of what is his own; for when people are motivated by truths they are motivated by 
something in themselves, but when they are motivated by good they are motivated by the Lord. </p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 From this it is evident that so far as a person allows himself to be led by means of truths towards good 
he is led by the Lord and towards the Lord; for in all things which have been joined together there is action and response, good being that which acts and truth that which responds. Truth however is 
never moved to respond of its own accord; it is moved to do so only by good. Consequently so far as truth is receptive of good it acts in response to it, and so far as it acts in response, it is joined 
to it. From this it also follows that before a person is joined to the Lord, the Lord spurs him on towards Himself by means of truths; and so far as the person allows himself to be led he is joined 
to the Lord, for God's truths are by nature such that they conform with good, because truths are conformable to good. As a result the person possesses perception, which is essentially a form of response. 
Allowing oneself to be spurred on or led by means of truths towards good implies living in accordance with them. These things have been mentioned in order that people may have some idea of what 
the first state of a person being regenerated is like, meant by 'six days of labour'.  </p>

`Sex diebus fiet opus': quod significet statum primum regenerationis hominis a Domino, et in supremo sensu glorificationis Humani Domini, constat ex significatione `sex dierum' qui praecedunt septimum 
seu sabbatum, et in quibus fiet opus, quod sit status primus regenerationis hominis a Domino, qui status est cum homo est in veris et per vera ducitur ad bonum, et tunc in pugnis, de qua n. 8510, 8888, 
9431, 10,360; quod etiam sit status glorificationis Humani Domini cum Ipse in mundo fuit, et ex Divino Vero pugnavit contra inferna, et redegit omnia ibi et in caelis in ordinem, videatur n. 10,360; 
sunt enim bini status homini cum regeneratur a Domino, prior cum in veris est et per vera ducitur ad bonum, posterior cum in bono est et ex bono videt et amat vera; homo in priore statu quidem ducitur 
a Domino, sed per {1}suum proprium, nam agere {2}ex veris est ex illis quae sunt apud hominem, sed agere ex bono est a Domino; inde patet quod quantum homo se patitur per {3}vera duci ad {4}bonum, 
tantum ducatur a Domino et ad Dominum, est enim actio et reactio in omnibus quae conjuncta sunt;{5} [2] agens est bonum {6}et reagens est verum; at verum nusquam reagit ex se sed ex bono, inde quantum 
verum recipit bonum tantum reagit, et quantum reagit tantum ei conjungitur;inde etiam sequitur quod Dominus, antequam conjungitur Ipsi homo, agat illum per vera ad Se; et quantum homo patitur se adduci 
tantum conjungatur; vera enim Divina talia sunt ut aptari possint bono, quoniam vera existunt ex bono; inde nunc homini perceptio, quae in se est reagentia; pati se agi seu adduci per vera ad bonum 
est vivere secundum illa.  Haec dicta sunt ut aliquo modo sciatur quomodo se habet cum primo statu hominis qui regeneratur, qui significatur per `sex dies laboris.' @1 proprium hominis$ @2 ex veris 
est ab homine altered to per vera est per illa quae sunt apud hominem$ @3 bonum IT$ @4 vera IT$ @5 i actio seu$ @6 reactio seu$ </p>
