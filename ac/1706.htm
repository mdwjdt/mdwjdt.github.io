And Abram heard that his brother had been captured, and he mustered his trainees, offspring of his household, three hundred eighteen of them, and pursued all the way to Dan.<br />Abram heard that his brother had been captured means that his intermediate self sensed what kind of state his outer self was in. And he mustered his trainees, offspring of his household, symbolizes the goodness in his outward self that was now free of slavery's yoke. Three hundred eighteen of them symbolizes the quality of that goodness. And he pursued all the way to Dan symbolizes the beginning of purification. </p>

was taken captive," signifies that the interior man perceived in what state was the external man; "and he hastened his trained men that were born in his house," signifies those goods in the external 
man that were now delivered from the yoke of servitude; "three hundred and eighteen," signifies their quality; "and pursued unto Dan," signifies the commencement of purification. </p>
