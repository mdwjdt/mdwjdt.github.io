<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1026节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1026.</strong>“与同你们一起的一切活的灵魂”一般表人里面已重生的一切事物。这从前后文，以及“活的”的含义清楚可知。凡从主接受生命的，都被称“活的”；而重生之人里面通过主存活的一切事物都被称为“活的灵魂”。重生之人里面的一切事物因着他所接受的生命而成为活的，包括其理性之物和情感之物。这生命在天使眼里而非世人眼里明显可见于他的思维和言语。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1026.</strong> With every living soul that is with you symbolizes everything in general that has been reborn in us. This can be seen from statements above and below [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1026/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1022" target=_top>1022</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1026/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1036" target=_top>1036</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1026/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1040" target=_top>1040</a>] and from the symbolism of living. Everything that receives life from the Lord is called living; everything in regenerate people that lives from that life is called a living soul. The extent to which we receive life when we are regenerate determines the extent to which individual elements inside us — both our reasoned ideas and our feelings — have life. This living force in the individual aspects of all we think and say is evident to angels, although it is not very evident to human beings. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1026</b></p><p><b>1026.</b>
And with every living soul that is with you. That this signifies in general all things in man that are regenerated, is evident from what precedes and from what follows, and also from the signification 
of "living." Everything is called "living" that has received life from the Lord, and everything a "living soul" that lives therefrom in the regenerate man. For according to the life which the regenerate 
man receives, everything in him is living, as well the things of his reason as his affections; and this life is apparent in everything of his thought and speech in the sight of angels, but not in 
that of man. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1026</b></p><p><b>1026.</b>
'With every living soul that is with you' means in general all things which with a person have been regenerated. This becomes clear from what comes before and after, and also from the meaning of the 
Living One. The expression 'living' is used for everything that has received life from the Lord, and 'living soul' for everything with the regenerate person which lives from Him. For it is according to 
the life that a regenerate person receives that every part of him has life, every part of his rational thought as well as of his affections. This life as it exists in every part of his thought and speech 
is visible to angels but not to man. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1026</b>
</p><b>1026.</b>
'Cum omni anima viva quae cum vobis': quod significent in genere omnia quae apud hominem regenerata sunt, constare potest ab illis quae praecedunt et ab illis quae sequuntur, tum a significatione vivi; 
vivum dicitur omne quod vitam accepit a Domino, 'anima viva omne quod apud hominem regeneratum inde vivit; nam secundum vitam quam accipit regeneratus, singula apud eum vivunt, tam ejus rationalia 
quam ejus affectiones; quae vita in singulis ejus cogitationi et loquelae apparet coram angelis, non ita coram homine. </p>
