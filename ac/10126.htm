<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10126节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10126</strong>.“使坛分别成圣”表因而那里的主。这从“分别为圣”的含义清楚可知，“分别为圣”是指代表主和来自主的神圣事物，因而代表祂在天堂和教会里的同在（参看<a href="10111.htm">10111</a>节）。当所代表的是一个实物时，在内义上所表示的就是这个实物。圣言的文字由属于天堂和教会的属天和属灵事物的代表构成，故在内义上所表示的就是这些事物。因此，主的圣言可称作在最低层的一种天堂；因为在天堂最低层所见所闻的一切事物都是高层天堂天使所言所思的那类事物的代表，这类事物都与信之真理和爱之良善有关，这类代表性事物之所以呈现在天堂的最低层，是因为那些在天堂最低层的人没有领悟天使智慧的更内在方面的能力，只能明白诸如代表它们的那类事物。此外，按照神性秩序，当高层事物降至低层时，它们就会转化为与它们具有相似性的形像，以这种方式呈现给外在感官，从而适合各人领悟它们的能力。正因如此，在其最低层，也就是字义上的圣言是存在于高层天堂中的属天和属灵事物的代表，并因此用来表示这些事物；通过这种手段，圣言也以一种适合世人领悟它的能力的形式而呈现给世人。以这种方式它还作为一个基础和根基而服务于众天堂。</p>

To sanctify it. That this signifies thus the Lord there, is evident from the signification of "sanctifying," as being to represent the Lord and the holy things which are from Him, thus His presence in 
heaven and in the church (see above, n. 10111). That which is represented is signified in the internal sense. The Word in the letter consists of representatives of celestial and spiritual things, which 
are of heaven and the church, and therefore in the internal sense these are signified. Hence the Word of the Lord may be called as it were heaven in ultimates, for in the ultimates of heaven all things 
which are seen and heard are representatives of such things as angels in the higher heavens are speaking and thinking, all which bear relation to the truths of faith and to the goods of love. That 
in the ultimates of heaven such things are representative, is because they who are in the ultimates of heaven do not apprehend the interior things of angelic wisdom, but only such things as represent 
them. It is also according to Divine order that when higher things fall down into lower, they are turned into such as are similar, and are thus presented before the external senses, thus accommodated 
to the apprehension of everyone. From this it is that the Word in ultimates, that is, in the sense of the letter, is representative, and consequently significative, of celestial and spiritual things 
which are in the higher heavens, and is hereby presented in a form accommodated to the apprehension of men. In this way it is also of service to the heavens as a basis and foundation. </p>

'To sanctify it' means thus the Lord there. This is clear from the meaning of 'sanctifying' as representing the Lord and the holy things that come from him, and so His presence in heaven and in the Church, 
dealt with above in <a href="10111.htm">10111</a>. When a reality is represented that same reality is meant in the internal sense. The letter of the Word consists of descriptions representative of the celestial and spiritual 
realities that belong to heaven and the Church, and therefore those realities are meant in the internal sense. Consequently the Word of the Lord may be called a kind of heaven on lowest levels; 
for all the things that are seen and heard on heaven's lowest levels are representative of what angels in higher heavens speak and think, all of which has regard to the truths of faith and forms of 
the good of love. The reason why such representative things are present on heaven's lowest levels is that those who are on heaven's lowest levels have no ability to grasp the more internal aspects of 
angelic wisdom, only such things as represent them. Furthermore it is in keeping with Divine order that when the higher realities pass down to lower levels they are converted into images bearing a similarity 
to them and are in this way presented to the outward senses, and so are accommodated to everyone's ability to grasp them. So it is that the Word on its lowest levels, that is, in the sense of 
the letter, is representative of and consequently serves to mean the celestial and spiritual realities that exist in the higher heavens, and that by this means the Word is also presented to people on 
earth in a form accommodated to their ability to grasp it. Thus it also serves as a base and foundation for the heavens.  </p>

</p><b>10126.</b>
`Ad sanctificandum illud': quod significet sic Dominus ibi, constat ex significatione `sanctificare' quod sit repraesentare Dominum et sancta quae ab Ipso, ita praesentiam Ipsius in caelo et in Ecclesia, 
de qua supra n. 10,111; quod repraesentatur, hoc in sensu interno significatur; Verbum {1} in littera consistit ex repraesentativis caelestium et spiritualium, quae sunt caeli et Ecclesiae, et ideo 
in sensu interno significant illa; (o)inde vocari potest Verbum Domini (o)quasi caelum in ultimis, nam in ultimis caeli omnia quae videntur et audiuntur {2} sunt repraesentativa talium quae loquuntur 
et cogitant angeli in caelis superioribus, quae omnia se referunt ad vera fidei et ad bona amoris; causa quod in caeli ultimis talia {3} repraesentativa {4} sint, est quia illi qui in ultimis caeli 
sunt non capiunt interiora sapientiae angelicae, sed modo talia quae repraesentant illa; etiam secundum ordinem Divinum est ut (t)cum superiora delabuntur in inferiora, vertantur in similia {5} et sic 
sistantur coram sensibus externis, ita accommodata cujusvis captui; inde est quod Verbum in ultimis, (o)hoc est, in sensu litterae sit repraesentativum, et inde significativum caelestium et spiritualium 
quae in caelis superioribus, et quod per id quoque sistatur accommodatum captui hominum; sic etiam inservit pro basi et fundamento caelis. </p>
