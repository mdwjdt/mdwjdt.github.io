<p><strong>[NCE]623.</strong> The fact that the land is described as full of violence because of unclean desires — especially the desires stemming from self-love, or flagrant arrogance — can also be seen from the Word. Violence is the name for the damage people inflict on holy things when they profane them. That is what these pre-Flood people did when they submerged doctrinal concepts in cravings of every kind. In Ezekiel, for example:<br />I will turn my face from them, and they will profane my hiding place. And if burglars enter it, they will profane it. Make a chain, because the land is full of judgment on [crimes of] blood, and the city is full of violence. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_623/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_7_22-23" target=_top>Ezekiel 7:22-23</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_623/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_7_24" target=_top>24</a>)<br />This describes the violent, identifying them as the kind of people depicted. In the same author:<br />They will eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water in desolation, so that the land of [Jerusalem] may be stripped of its abundance, on account of the violence of all those living in it. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_623/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_12_19" target=_top>Ezekiel 12:19</a>)<br />The bread they will eat with anxiety is heavenly food, and the water they will drink in desolation is spiritual drink, both of which they treated violently, that is, profaned.<br />[2] In Isaiah:<br />Their webs will not be for clothing, and they will not be dressed in their works. Their works are works of wickedness, and the perpetration of violence is in the palms of their hands. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_623/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_59_6" target=_top>Isaiah 59:6</a>)<br />The webs and clothes refer to objects of mental activity, or of thought, the wickedness and violence to products of the will, or of works. In Jonah:<br />May they each be turned from their evil way and from the violence that is in the palms of their hands. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_623/bible_king-james-version_jonah_3_8" target=_top>Jonah 3:8</a>)<br />The evil way refers to falsities in the intellect, and the violence, to evil in the will. In Jeremiah:<br />Within a year will come rumor and violence in the land. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_623/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_51_46" target=_top>Jeremiah 51:46</a>)<br />Rumor stands for properties of the intellect, violence for those of the will. In Isaiah:<br />No violence has he done, and no deceit is in his mouth. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_623/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_53_9" target=_top>Isaiah 53:9</a>)<br />Violence has to do with traits of the will, deceit in the mouth with those of the intellect. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 623</b></p><p><b>623.</b>
The earth was filled with violence. That this is said on account of their foul cupidities, and most of all on account of those which come of the love of self, or of inordinate arrogance, is evident from 
the Word. It is called "violence" when men do violence to holy things by profaning them, as did these antediluvians who immersed the doctrinal things of faith in all kinds of cupidities. As in Ezekiel: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>My faces will I turn from them, and they shall profane My secret [place], and robbers shall enter into it and profane it. Make the chain; for the land is full of the judgment of bloods, and 
the city is full of violence (Ezek. 7:22-23). </p>
</blockquote>
<p> 
    The "violent" are here described as to who they are, and that they are such as we have stated. Again: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>They shall eat their bread in solicitude, and 
drink their waters in desolation, that her land may be devastated from its fullness, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein (Ezek. 12:19). 
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>     The "bread which they shall eat in solicitude" 
is the celestial things, and the "waters which they shall drink in desolation" are the spiritual things, to which they have done violence, or which they have profaned. </p>
<p>     [2] In Isaiah: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Their 
webs shall not be for garments; neither shall they be covered in their works; their works are works of iniquity, and the deed of violence is in their hands (Isa. 59:6).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>     Here "webs" and "garments" are 
predicated of things of the understanding, that is, of the thought; "iniquity" and "violence" of things of the will, that is, of works. In Jonah: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Let them turn everyone from his evil way, and 
from the violence that is in their hands (Jonah 3:8),</p>
</blockquote>
<p>     where the "evil way" is predicated of falsities, which are of the understanding; and "violence" of evils, which are of the will. In Jeremiah: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>A rumor shall come in one year, and violence in the land (Jer. 51:46). 
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  
   "A rumor" denotes things which are of the understanding, "violence" those which are of the will. In Isaiah: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>He hath done 
no violence, neither was there any deceit in His mouth (Isa. 53:9). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>     Here also "violence" denotes the things of the will; "deceit in His mouth" those of the understanding. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 623</b></p><p><b>623.</b>
It is clear from the Word that 'the earth' is said to be 'filled with violence' on account of their filthy desires, most of all on account of the desires constituting self-love, or extreme arrogance. 
It is called 'violence when people do violence to holy things by desecrating them, as those before the Flood did, who immersed doctrinal matters concerning faith in every possible kind of evil desire. 
As in Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
I will turn My face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> away from them, and they will profane My secret place. And let robbers come into it and they will profane it. Make the chain, for the land is full of the judgement 
of blood, and the city is full of violence. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%207:22-24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 7:22-24</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This describes who the violent are, and that they are such as mentioned. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
They will eat their bread in anxiety, 
and drink their waters in desolation, that her land may be devastated of the fullness that is in it, on account of the violence of all who dwell in it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2012:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 12:19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The bread which they will eat 
in anxiety' means celestial things, the waters which they will drink in desolation' the spiritual things, which they did violence to, that is, profaned. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Their webs will not become 
clothing, nor will they be covered in their works. Their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2059:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 59:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'webs' and 'clothing' have reference to the things 
of the understanding or thought, while 'iniquity' and 'violence' have reference to those of the will or actions. In Jonah, </p>
<blockquote>
Let every one turn from his evil way, and from the violence which is in his 
hands. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jonah%203:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jonah 3:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'evil way' has reference to falsities constituting the understanding, and 'violence' to evils constituting the will. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
There will come in a year, rumour and 
violence in the land. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2051:46&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 51:46</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Rumour' stands for things of the understanding, 'violence' for those of the will. In Isaiah, He did no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2053:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 53:9</a>. </p>
<p>Here 
'violence' concerns things of the will, 'deceit in his mouth' those of the understanding.
