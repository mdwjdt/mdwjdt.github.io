<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1798节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1798.</strong>“亚伯兰又说，你看，你没有给我种”表没有教会的内在，也就是爱和信。这从“种”和下文“后嗣”的含义清楚可知：前面已说明，“种”是指爱和信（<a href="255.htm">255</a>，<a href="256.htm">256</a>，<a href="1025.htm">1025</a>节）。前面多次阐明，爱和源于爱的信构成教会的内在。构成教会内在的信并非指其它信，而是指作为爱或仁之产物的信，也就是说，这信源于爱或仁。<br />一般意义上的信是指教会所教导的一切事物。然而，脱离爱或仁的教义绝不构成教会的内在，因为教义无非是存在于记忆中的知识。即便最坏的人，哪怕地狱里的人也具有这种知识。但源于或属于仁爱的教义构成教会的内在，因为这内在本质上是教会的生命。生命本身构成一切敬拜的内在方面，因而就是从仁爱的生命所流出的一切教义。此处所指的正是这些属于信的教义。教会的内在就是这种信，这仅从以下考虑就能看出来：凡过着仁爱生活的人都能意识到信的一切事物。若愿意，仅仅检查一下教义，你就能明白它们的性质和品质。它们岂不全都涉及仁爱，因而涉及源于仁爱之信吗？<br />仅以十诫为例。其中第一诫是当敬拜主神。凡拥有爱或仁爱生活的人都敬拜主神，因为这是他的生命。另一条诫命说要守安息日，凡拥有爱或仁爱生活的人都遵守神圣的安息日，因为对他来说，没有比敬拜主，每天荣耀祂更甜蜜的事了。“不可杀人”这条诫命则完全涉及仁爱，凡爱邻如己者都对伤害邻人的事感到不寒而栗，更不用说杀他了。“不可偷盗”这条诫命也一样，因为凡拥有仁爱生活的人宁愿把自己的东西给邻人，也不会拿走邻人的东西。“不可奸淫”这条诫命同样如此，凡拥有仁爱生活的人都愿保护邻人的妻子，以免有人对她造成伤害，并视通奸为违背良知的罪恶，就是诸如摧毁婚姻之爱及其责任的那类罪恶。觊觎邻人的东西也有违那些拥有仁爱生活之人的良心，因为仁爱的本质就是通过自己和自己的东西对他人意愿良善。因此，这种人绝不会觊觎别人的东西。<br />这些诫命就包括在十诫中，是相对外在的信之教义。它们不仅仅作为知识停留在拥有仁爱及其生活者的记忆中，而是在他心里。它们还铭刻在他身上，因为它们就在他的仁爱中，因而在他的真生命中。此外，他同样唯独通过仁爱认识其它具有教义性质的事物，因为他照着正义的良知生活。对于无法以这种方式理解和查究的正义和真理，他都会简单地，即出于简单的心思相信就是如此，因为主曾这样说过。凡具有这种信念的人都不会做错事，哪怕他所接受的本身并非真正的真理，只是表面的真理。<br />以相信主会发怒、惩罚、试探等等之人为例，或许他们还相信圣餐里的饼和酒具有某种灵义，或肉和血以某种方式存在于他们所能解释的事物中。无论他们这样说还是那样说，都没什么关系。事实上，很少有人思考这类问题，即便思考，只要出于简单的心思，也没什么关系。因为他们就是这样被教导的，但仍过着仁爱的生活。当这些人听说饼和酒的内义表示主对全人类的爱，和属于这爱的事物，以及人回以主和邻人的爱时，他们立刻相信，欣然接受。然而，那些拥有教义但缺乏仁爱的人则不然。他们争论一切事，并谴责凡不照着他们所说的（他们称其为“信”）说话之人。谁都能由此看出，对主之爱和对邻之仁就是教会的内在。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1798.</strong> Abram said, "Here, you have not given me seed," means that the church had no inner dimension, which is love and faith. This is established by the symbolism of seed as love and faith, discussed earlier, in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1798/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_255" target=_top>255</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1798/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_256" target=_top>256</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1798/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1025" target=_top>1025</a>. It can also be seen from the symbolism of an heir, discussed below.<br />It has been stated and shown several times before that love and the faith it inspires is the inner core of the church.{*1} In describing faith as the inner core of the church, I mean no other faith than the faith of love or charity, that is, the faith that comes of love or charity.<br />[2] In a broad sense, faith is everything the church teaches. A teaching devoid of love or charity, however, makes no part of the church's core. A doctrine is merely a piece of knowledge, and knowledge is memorization. The worst people — even those in hell — can memorize. When a doctrine develops out of charity, though, or is imbued with charity, it does go to make up the inner core, because it is part of life. Life itself is the inner core of all worship, so whenever a doctrinal teaching rises out of a life of thoughtfulness, it is the kind of teaching that belongs to the faith meant here.<br />The idea that this faith is the kind that forms the inner core of religion can be seen from a single fact: anyone who lives a life of love for others knows everything there is to know about faith. If you wish, simply look at various doctrines to see what they teach and where they tend. Do they not all lead to love for our neighbor? So do they not all belong to the faith that comes from neighborly love?<br />[3] Take just the Ten Commandments. The first is to worship the Lord our God. Those who live a life of love or kindness worship the Lord God, because a life of love or kindness is his life. The second is to keep the Sabbath. Those who live a life of love, or live in charity, keep the Sabbath reverently, because nothing is sweeter to them than worshiping the Lord and glorifying him every day. The commandment against murder is all about charity. Those who love their neighbor as themselves would be aghast at doing anything to hurt others, let alone killing them. The ban on theft is the same. Those who live a life of kindness give what they have to their neighbor rather than take anything away. The ban on adultery likewise. Those who take up a life of kindness would rather protect their neighbor's wife, to prevent anyone from inflicting that kind of harm on her.{*2} They also look on adultery as a crime against conscience — one that destroys both the love between married partners and the duties they owe each other. Coveting what belongs to their neighbor also offends those who live a life of charity, because charity involves wanting others to benefit from us and our possessions. So people like this never covet what belongs to someone else.<br />[4] These are the commandments of the Decalogue, which are among the more accessible religious teachings. People who have charity and live thoughtful lives do not know these commandments by rote but hold them in their heart and have them written on their soul, because the commandments are an integral part of charity and therefore of a charitable life.<br />The church does have other official doctrines, and people who love their neighbor know these simply as a result of their love too, because they live by what they know is right. If they cannot fully understand or figure out a given claim of rightness or truth, they still believe it in simplicity, or with a simple heart. They think, "This is so, because the Lord has said it." No one who has this kind of belief is doing anything wrong, even if the belief is not true in and of itself but only appears to be true.<br />[5] Take for example the idea that the Lord feels angry at us, punishes us, tests us, and so on. Take also the idea that the bread and wine of the Holy Supper is symbolic; or else that Christ's flesh and blood are actually present in some way that "they" explain. None of this matters, whether the authorities say one thing or the other.{*3} (Few even think about it, though. Those who do just need to make sure their thoughts come from an innocent heart.) None of it matters to people who love their neighbor because that is simply how they have been taught, and they live lives of kindness anyway. When they hear that bread and wine on an inner level symbolize the Lord's love for the whole human race — and everything entailed in this love, as well as the love we return to the Lord and our neighbor — they immediately believe and rejoice in it.<br />Not so those who devote themselves to doctrine rather than to a life of love. They quibble about everything and condemn anyone who does not speak (they use the word believe) as they do.<br />From this anyone can see that love for the Lord and charity for our neighbor is the inner core of religion.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For more on love and faith as the inner core of the church, see, for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1798/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_768#subsection-2-3" target=_top>768:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1798/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_809" target=_top>809</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1798/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_916" target=_top>916</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1798/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1083" target=_top>1083</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1798/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1098" target=_top>1098</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1798/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1100" target=_top>1100</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1798/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1102" target=_top>1102</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1798/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1151" target=_top>1151</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1798/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1153" target=_top>1153</a>. [LHC]<br />{*2} The Latin word here translated "her," ei, may also mean "him." If it does so, Swedenborg may be following the Bible here in seeing the offense primarily from the man's point of view: "You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1798/bible_king-james-version_exodus_20_17" target=_top>Exodus 20:17</a>; New Revised Standard Version). The next sentence in the translation, which speaks of harm to both partners, portrays the situation more from the points of view of both husband and wife. [RS]<br />{*3} Swedenborg is alluding to the longstanding debate over the nature of the "Real Presence" in the Eucharist: that is, whether the bread and wine were literally transformed into the body and blood of Christ (a concept known as transubstantiation), as opposed to being merely symbols of his body and blood. The Catholic Church upholds the doctrine of transubstantiation and the Real Presence. (See The New Catholic Encyclopedia 2003, under "transubstantiation.") Martin Luther taught a modified version of this doctrine, holding that the body and blood of Christ were present in, with, and under the forms of bread and wine — a doctrine sometimes called consubstantiation. See The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church 2005, under "consubstantiation" and "Eucharist." [RS] </p>

Abram said, Lo to me Thou hast not given seed. That this signifies that there was no internal of the church, is evident from the signification of "seed," which is love and faith, spoken of above (n. 
255, 256, 1025), and from the signification of an heir, as explained in what follows. That love and the faith derived from it are the internal of the church, has already been several times said and shown. 
No other faith is meant as being the internal of the church than that which is of love or charity, that is, which is from love or charity.  [2] Faith, in a general sense, is all the doctrinal teaching 
of the church. But doctrine [doctrinale] separated from love or charity, by no means makes the internal of the church, for doctrine is only knowledge which is of the memory, and this exists also 
with the worst men, and even with infernals. But the doctrine that is from charity, or that is of charity, does make the internal of the church, for this is of the life. The life itself is the internal 
of all worship; and so is all doctrine that flows from the life of charity and it is this doctrine that is of faith which is here meant. That it is this faith which is the internal of the church, 
may be seen from this consideration alone, that he who has the life of charity is acquainted with all things of faith. If you will, just examine all doctrinal things, and see what and of what quality 
they are; do they not all pertain to charity, and consequently to the faith that is from charity?  [3] Take only the Precepts of the Decalogue. The first of these is to worship the Lord God. He who has 
the life of love or of charity worships the Lord God, because this is his life. Another precept is to keep the Sabbath. He who is in the life of love, or in charity, keeps the Sabbath holy, for nothing 
is more sweet to him than to worship the Lord, and to glorify Him every day. The precept, "Thou shalt not kill," is altogether of charity. He who loves his neighbor as himself, shudders at doing 
anything that injures him, still more at killing him. So too the precept, "Thou shalt not steal;" for he who has the life of charity would rather give of his own to his neighbor, than take anything away 
from him. And so with the precept, "Thou shalt not commit adultery;" he who is in the life of charity the rather guards his neighbor's wife, lest anyone should offer her such injury, and regards adultery 
as a crime against conscience, and such as destroys conjugial love and its duties. To covet the things that are the neighbor's is also contrary to those who are in the life of charity; for it is 
of charity to desire good to others from one's self and one's own; such therefore by no means covet the things which are another's.  [4] These are the precepts of the Decalogue which are more external 
doctrinal things of faith; and these are not only known in the memory by him who is in charity and its life, but are in his heart; and he has them inscribed upon himself, because they are in his charity, 
and thus in his very life; besides other things of a dogmatic nature which he in like manner knows from charity alone; for he lives according to a conscience of what is right. The right and the 
truth which he cannot thus understand and explore, he believes simply or from simplicity of heart to be so because the Lord has said so; and he who so believes does not do wrong, even though what he 
thus accepts is not true in itself, but apparent truth.  [5] As for example, if anyone believes that the Lord is angry, punishes, tempts, and the like. Or if he holds that the bread and wine in the 
Holy Supper are significative, or that the flesh and blood are present in some way in which they explain it-it is of no consequence whether they say the one thing or the other, although there are few 
who think about this matter, or even if they do think about it, provided this is done from a simple heart, because they have been so instructed, and nevertheless live in charity: these, when they hear 
that the bread and wine in the internal sense signify the Lord's love toward the whole human race, and the things which are of this love, and man's reciprocal love to the Lord and the neighbor, they 
forthwith believe, and rejoice that it is so. Not so they who are in doctrinal things and not in charity; these contend about everything, and condemn all whoever they may be that do not say (they call 
it "believe") as they do. From all this everyone can see that love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor are the internal of the church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1798</b></p><p><b>1798.</b>
That 'Abram said, See, to me You have not given seed' means that there was no internal dimension of the Church, [which is love and faith,] is clear from the meaning of 'seed' as love and faith, dealt 
with already in <a href="255.htm">255</a>, <a href="256.htm">256</a>,<a href="1025.htm">1025</a>, and in what follows below from the meaning of 'an heir'. The fact that love and faith deriving from love constitute the internal dimension of the Church has been stated 
and shown frequently already. No other kind of faith that constitutes the internal dimension of the Church is meant than the faith which is a product of love or charity, that is, which originates in 
love or charity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In a general sense faith embraces everything that is taught by the Church; but doctrinal teachings separated from love or charity do not in any way constitute the internal dimension 
of the Church, for such teachings are no more than knowledge which is present in the memory and which also exists with the worst of people, even with those in hell. But doctrinal teachings which 
originate in charity, that is, which are a product of charity, do constitute the internal dimension of the Church, for this dimension is essentially its life. The life itself constitutes the internal 
aspect of all worship, and so too do all doctrinal teachings that flow from the life that belongs to charity. It is these teachings when they comprise faith that are meant here, and it is faith such 
as this that constitutes the internal dimension of the Church, as may become clear from the single consideration that anyone who is leading a charitable life has an awareness of all things of faith. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
Just examine, if you care to do so, any doctrinal teachings, so that you may see what they are and what they are like. Do they not all have regard to charity, and so to faith that derives from charity? 
Take simply the Ten Commandments, the first of which is that you should worship the Lord God. Anyone who possesses the life of love or charity worships the Lord God, for it is in this that the 
life within him consists. Another commandment says that you should keep the Sabbath. Anyone in whom the life of love, that is, in whom charity, is present keeps the Sabbath holy since nothing delights 
him more than worshipping the Lord and declaring His glory day by day. The commandment that you should not kill has regard entirely to charity. Anyone who loves his neighbour as himself shudders at 
doing him any injury whatever, and even more at killing him. Likewise with the commandment that you should not steal, for the person who possesses the life of charity would rather give from what is his 
own to his neighbour than take away anything from him. Equally the commandment that you should not commit adultery. A man in whom the life of charity is present is minded rather to protect his neighbour's 
wife lest anyone should do such great harm to her, and regards adultery as a crime committed against conscience, such as destroys conjugial love and the responsibilities that go with it. Coveting 
things that belong to the neighbour is also contrary to the mind of those in whom the life of charity is present, for the essence of charity is to will good to others from oneself and what is one's 
own, thus they in no way covet what belongs to another. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 These Commandments, included among the Ten, are more external matters of doctrine concerning faith, which are not simply retained as knowledge 
in the memory of him in whom charity and the life of charity are present, but are in his heart. They are also inscribed upon him because they are grounded in his charity and so in his very life, 
in addition to other things of a dogmatic nature that are inscribed upon him which in a similar way he knows from charity alone. For he lives in accordance with a conscience for that which is right. 
Anything right or true which he is unable to understand and examine in this fashion he nevertheless believes in simplicity - that is, in simplicity of heart - to be right or true because the Lord has 
so said. Nor is anything wrong with such belief, even if that which is believed is not in itself true, only an appearance of truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 People may believe for example that the Lord can be angry, punish, 
tempt, and the like. Also, they may believe that in the Holy Supper the bread and wine have some spiritual meaning, or that flesh and blood are present in some way or other which they are able 
to explain. But whether they express the one or the other of these views about the Holy Supper, it makes no difference provided that two things are characteristic of these persons: Few people in fact 
give the matter any thought at all, and if any do give it any thought it makes no difference which view is held provided, a) It is done from a simple heart because it is what they have been taught, and 
b) They are leading charitable lives. When they hear that the bread and wine mean in the internal sense the Lord's love towards the whole human race, and the things that go with that love, and man's 
reciprocated love to the Lord and towards the neighbour, they believe it instantly and rejoice that it really is so. This is never the case with those who possess doctrine yet lack charity. They dispute 
everything and condemn anyone who does not speak- though they say it is to believe - as they do. From these considerations it may become clear to anyone that love to the Lord and charity towards the 
neighbour constitute the internal dimension of the Church. </p>

Quod 'dixit Abram, En mihi non dedisti semen' significet quod non internum Ecclesiae, constat a significatione 'seminis' quod sit amor et fides, de qua prius n. 255, 256, 1025, et in sequentibus a significatione 
'heredis': quod amor et inde fides sit internum Ecclesiae, prius aliquoties dictum et ostensum est; non alia fides quae internum Ecclesiae est, intelligitur quam quae est amoris seu charitatis,

est solum scientia quae est memoriae, quae datur quoque apud pessimos, etiam apud infernales; sed doctrinale quod est ex charitate seu quod est charitatis, hoc facit internum, nam hoc est vitae;

praecepta decalogi, cujus primum est 'ut colas Dominum Deum'; qui vitam amoris seu charitatis habet, is colit Dominum Deum, quia hoc est vita ipsius: alterum, 'ut Sabbatum observes'; qui in amoris 
vita est, seu in charitate, is sancte observat Sabbatum, nam nihil ei dulcius est quam colere Dominum, et glorificare Ipsum omni die: praeceptum 'ne occidas,' hoc prorsus est charitatis; qui amat proximum 
ut semet, horret quicquam facere quod illum laedit, magis illum occidere: 'ne fureris,' similiter; qui enim vitam charitatis habet, is potius ex suo dat proximo quam ut quicquam ei auferat: 'ne 
adulteris,' pariter; qui in charitatis vita est, proximi uxorem potius custodit, De aliquis tale damnum ei inferat, et adulterium spectat ut facinus contra conscientiam, et tale quod amorem conjugialem 
et ejus debita destruit: 'concupiscere quae sunt proximi,' (x)est quoque contra illos qui in charitatis vita sunt, nam charitatis est velle aliis bonum ex se et suo, ita nusquam concupiscunt quae alterius 
sunt: [4] haec sunt praecepta decalogi quae exteriora doctrinalia fidei, quae ab illo qui in charitate et ejus vita est, non memoria tenus sciuntur sed sunt in corde ejus, et illa habet sibi inscripta, 
quia sunt in charitate, ita in ipsa ejus vita: praeter alia quae dogmatica sunt, quae similiter novit ex sola charitate, vivit enim secundum conscientiam recti; rectum et verum, quod non ita 
potest intelligere et explorare, hoc credit simpliciter seu ex simplici corde quod ita sit quia Dominus ita dixit, et qui ita credit, is non malum facit, tametsi non esset verum in se sed verum apparens; 
[5] ut pro exemplo, quod Dominus irascatur, puniat, tentet, et similia; tum quoque, quod in Sacra Cena panis et vinum sit significativum quid, vel quod caro et sanguis adsit aliquo modo quo explicant, 
hoc nihil facit sive unum sive alteram dicant, tametsi pauci sunt qui de hoc cogitant, sique cogitant, modo fiat ex simplici corde, quia ita instructi, et usque in charitate vivunt; ii cum audiunt 
quod panis et vinum in sensu interno significent amorem Domini erga universum genus humanum et quae amoris sunt, et reciprocum hominis in Dominum et erga proximum, ilico credunt, et gaudent quod ita 
se habeat; nusquam illi qui in doctrinalibus sunt et non in charitate; hi litigant de omni, et damnant quoscumque qui non dicunt, quod vocant Credere, sicut illi: ex his constare unicuivis potest quod 
amor in Dominum et charitas erga proximum sit internum Ecclesiae. </p>
