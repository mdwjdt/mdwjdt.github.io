<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8511节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8511.</strong>出埃及记16:28-31.耶和华对摩西说，你们不肯守我的诫命和律法要到几时呢？你们看！耶和华既将安息日赐给你们，所以第六天祂赐给你们两天的食物，第七天各人要在自己的地方休息，不许什么人从自己的地方出去。于是，百姓第七天休息了。以色列家给它起名叫吗哪，样子像芫荽的种子，白色，味道如同蜜饼。<br />“耶和华对摩西说”表神性的显现已经变得模糊。“你们不肯守我的诫命和律法要到几时呢”表因为他们不照神性秩序行事。“你们看”表他们当留意并反思。“耶和华既将安息日赐给你们”表良善与真理被主结合。“所以第六天祂赐给你们两天的食物”表因此，甚至直到前一个状态的结束，祂通过真理所赐良善的量和此后这种结合实现时的一样大。“各人要在自己的地方休息”表一种平安的状态。“第七天不许什么人从自己的地方出去”表这时他们必须保持这种状态。“于是，百姓第七天休息了”表这时在一种平安状态下良善与真理结合的一个代表。“以色列家给它起名叫吗哪”表它在他们中间的本质。“样子像芫荽的种子，白色”表它里面的真理，它是纯净的。“味道如同蜜饼”表良善是令人快乐的，因为它一开始是真理，但通过快乐被作成了良善。</p>

Verses 28-31. And Jehovah said unto Moses, How long do ye refuse to keep My commandments and My laws? See ye, because Jehovah hath given you the Sabbath, therefore He giveth you on the sixth day the 
bread of two days; rest ye everyone in his place, let no one go forth from his place on the seventh day. And the people rested on the seventh day. And the house of Israel called the name of it Manna; 
and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like that of a cake in honey. "And Jehovah said unto Moses," signifies the appearing of the Divine obscured; "How long do ye refuse to keep 
My commandments and My laws?" signifies on account of their not acting according to Divine order; "see ye," signifies that they should pay attention and reflect; "because Jehovah hath given you the 
Sabbath," signifies the conjunction of good and truth by the Lord; "therefore He giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days," signifies that on this account even to the end of the former state 
He gives as much good through truth as will afterward effect this conjunction; "rest ye everyone in his place," signifies a state of peace; "let no one go forth from his place on the seventh day," signifies 
that they must then remain in this state; "and the people rested on the seventh day," signifies a representative then of the conjunction of good and truth in a state of peace; "and the house of 
Israel called the name of it Manna," signifies its quality in respect to them; "and it was like coriander seed, white," signifies the truth therein that it was pure; "and the taste of it was like that 
of a cake in honey," signifies that the good was delightful because it had been made good from truth by means of delight. </p>

Verses 28-31 And Jehovah said to Moses, How long do you refuse to keep My commandments and My laws? See! Because Jehovah has given you the sabbath, therefore on the sixth day He gives you the bread of 
two days; rest, each of you in his place,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> let no one go out of his place on the seventh day. And the people rested on the seventh day. And the house of Israel called its name Man;<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> and it was like 
coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like that of a cake with honey. </p>
<p>'And Jehovah said to Moses' means that the appearance of the Divine had become obscured. 'How long do you refuse to keep 
My commandments and My laws?' means because their actions were not in keeping with Divine order. 'See!' means that they should pay attention and stop to reflect. 'Because Jehovah has given you the 
sabbath' means the joining together of goodness and truth by the Lord. 'Therefore on the sixth day He gives you the bread of two days' means that for this reason right at the end of the former state 
He imparts so great an amount of good through truth that the joining together takes place after that. 'Rest, each of you in his place' means a state of peace. 'Let no one go out of his place on the seventh 
day' means that they must now remain in that state. 'And the people rested on the seventh day' means that the joining together of goodness and truth in a state of peace was now represented. 'And 
the house of Israel called its name Man' means its essential nature among them. 'And it was like coriander seed, white' means the truth within it, that it was pure. 'And the taste of it was like that 
of a cake with honey' means that the good was delightful, like that which began as truth but was made into good by means of delight.

Vers. 28-31.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Quousque renuitis custodire praecepta Mea, et leges Meas?  Videte quia Jehovah dedit vobis sabbatum, propterea Ille dat vobis in die sexto panem duorum dierum; 
quiescite quisque sub se, ne exeat quisquam e loco suo in die septimo.  Et quieverunt populus in die septimo.  Et vocaverunt domus Israelis nomen ejus man; et hoc sicut semen coriandri album, et 
sapor ejus sicut placentae in melle.  `Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen' significat apparentiam Divini obscuratam: `Quousque renuitis custodire praecepta Mea, et leges Meas?' significat propter quod non secundum 
ordinem Divinum agerent:  `videte' significat ut advertant et reflectant: `quia Jehovah dedit vobis sabbatum' significat conjunctionem boni et veri a Domino: `propterea Ille dat vobis in die sexto 
panem duorum dierum' significat quod ideo usque ad finem status prioris tantum boni per verum det, ut conjunctio dein fiat: `quiescite quisque sub se' significat statum pacis: `ne exeat quisquam e 
loco suo in die septimo' significat quod manendum tunc in statu: `et quieverunt populus in die septimo' significat repraesentativum tunc conjunctionis boni et veri in statu pacis: `et vocaverunt domus 
Israelis nomen ejus man' significat quale ejus (x)apud illos: `et hoc sicut semen coriandri album' significat verum inibi quod purum: `et (x)sapor ejus sicut placentae in melle' significat bonum quod 
jucundum, sicut quod ex vero per jucundum factum bonum. </p>
