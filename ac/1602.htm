<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1602.</strong>“耶和华对亚伯兰说”表耶和华如此对主说。这从圣言的内义清楚可知，“亚伯兰”的内义是指主；还从那时主所在的状态本身可知，也就是说，造成妨碍的外在事物已除去。这就是“罗得离别亚伯兰以后”这句话所表示的。就内在人而言，主是神性，因为祂是从耶和华生的；所以当外在人那一方没有任何妨碍时，祂因此看到将要发生的一切事。那时看似耶和华说的原因是，这事发生在外在人面前。就内在人而言，主与耶和华为一，如主本人在约翰福音中所亲自教导的：<br />腓力说，将父显给我们看。耶稣对他说，腓力，我与你们同在这样长久，你还不认识我吗？人看见了我，就是看见了父，你怎么说，将父显给我们看呢？我在父里面，父在我里面，你不信吗？你们当信我，我在父里面，父在我里面。 （约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.6.htm">14:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.8.htm">8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.11.htm">11</a>）</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1602.</strong> Jehovah said to Abram means this is the way Jehovah talked to the Lord, as can be seen from the inner sense of the Word, in which Abram means the Lord. It can also be seen from the actual state he was then in, which is depicted here. The state was one in which superficial traits that would get in the way were put aside, and it is symbolized by the words "after Lot separated from him."<br />The Lord's inner being was divine, because he was born of Jehovah. So naturally when there were no obstacles on the part of his outer self, he saw the whole future.<br />The reason this presented itself at the time as speech by Jehovah is that the viewpoint was that of his outer self. In regard to his inner self, he was one with Jehovah, as the Lord himself teaches in John:<br />Philip said, "Show us the Father." Jesus said to him, "After all the time I've spent with you, don't you know me, Philip? Whoever sees me sees the Father. How then can you say, 钬楽how us the Father'? Don't you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me."

Jehovah said unto Abram. That this signifies that Jehovah thus spoke to the Lord, may be seen from the internal sense of the Word, in which the Lord is meant by "Abram;" and also from the state itself 
in which He then was, which is also described here, namely, that the external things that impeded had been removed, which is signified by the words "after that Lot was separated from him." In respect 
to the internal man, the Lord was Divine, because born from Jehovah; and therefore when nothing impeded on the part of the external man, it follows that He saw all things that were to come; and that 
this then appeared as if Jehovah spoke is because it appeared before the external man. In respect to His internal man the Lord was one with Jehovah, as He Himself teaches in John: </p>
<p>     Philip said, 
Show us the Father. Jesus said, Have I been so long time with you, and hast thou not known Me, Philip? He that seeth Me seeth the Father; how sayest thou, then, Show us the Father? Believest thou not 
that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me? Believe Me that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me (John 14:6, 8-11). </p>

That 'Jehovah said to Abram' means that Jehovah so spoke to the Lord becomes clear from the internal sense of the Word, in which the Lord is meant by 'Abram', and also from the very state that was His 
at that time and which is also described here, that is to say, a state in which external things that obstructed were removed. This is what is meant by the statement 'after Lot had been separated from 
him'. The Lord was Divine as regards His Internal Man because He was begotten from Jehovah, and so when there was no obstruction on the part of the External Man, He consequently saw all things to come. 
The reason this then seemed to be 'Jehovah saying' is that it took place in the presence of the External Man. As regards the Internal Man He was One with Jehovah, as the Lord Himself teaches in John, </p>
<blockquote>
Philip 
said, Show us the Father. Jesus said to him, Have I been with you so long and yet you do not know Me, Philip? He who sees Me sees the Father So why do you say, Show us the Father? Do you 
not believe that I am in the Father and the Father in Me? Believe Me, that I am in the Father and the Father in Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:6,%208-11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:6, 8-11</a>.

Quod 'Jehovah dixit ad Abram' significet quod Jehovah ita locutus ad Dominum, constare potest ex sensu interno Verbi, in quo Dominus per 'Abramum' intelligitur; tum quoque ex ipso statu in quo tunc 
fuit, qui hic quoque describitur quod nempe externa quae impedirent, remota sint, quae significantur per haec, 'postquam separatus est Lot ab illo': Dominus quoad Internum Hominem fuit Divinus quia natus 
a Jehovah, quare cum nihil impediret a parte Externi Hominis, sequitur quod viderit omnia ventura: et quod hoc apparuerit tunc sicut 'locutus Jehovah,' est quia coram Externo Homine; quoad Internum 
Hominem Unus erat cum Jehovah, sicut Ipse Dominus docet apud Johannem, </p>
<p>	Dixit Philippus, Monstra nobis Patrem;... dixit ei Jesus, Tantum temporis vobiscum sum, non nosti Me, Philippe? qui videt Me, 
videt Patrem; quomodo ergo tu dicis, Monstra nobis Patrem? nonne credis, quod Ego in Patre, et Pater in 	Me sit?... credite Mihi, quod Ego in Patre, et Pater in Me, 	xiv 6, 8-11. </p>
