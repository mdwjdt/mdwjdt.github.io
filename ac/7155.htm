<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7155节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7155.</strong>“以色列人的官长就见他们遭遇祸患了”表他们发现自己接近诅咒。这从“见”、“官长”和“祸患”的含义清楚可知：“见”是指发觉（<a href="2150.htm">2150</a>，<a href="3764.htm">3764</a>，<a href="4567.htm">4567</a>，<a href="4723.htm">4723</a>，<a href="5400.htm">5400</a>节）；“官长”是指那些最近距离地接受并传递侵扰之人（<a href="7111.htm">7111</a>，<a href="7136.htm">7136</a>节）；“祸患”是指诅咒，因为就本身而言，祸患（即邪恶）就是地狱（<a href="6279.htm">6279</a>节），因而是诅咒。“遭遇祸患”（即陷入邪恶）之所以表示接近诅咒，是因为那些最近距离地接受并传递侵扰之人会受到伤害，这一点由他们受督工责打来表示（<a href="7136.htm">7136</a>节），还因为不断引入的虚假的侵扰甚至使他们陷入绝望（<a href="7147.htm">7147</a>节）。正因如此，“他们就见他们遭遇祸患了”表示他们发觉自己接近诅咒。事实上，那些陷入绝望的人以为自己再也经不起它们的攻击，故以为他们除了像囚犯一样向虚假投降外，别无选择。这就是绝望的状态；然而，在这种状态下，他们开始如释重负，从中被提升上来，可以说从黑暗被引入光明。</p>

And the officers of the sons of Israel saw that they were in evil. That this signifies that they saw themselves near damnation, is evident from the signification of "seeing," as being to perceive (n. 
2150, 3764, 4567, 4723, 5400); from the signification of the "officers," as being those who most closely receive and communicate the infestations (n. 7111, 7136); and from the signification of "evil," 
as being damnation for regarded in itself evil is hell (n. 6279), thus damnation. That "to be in evil" denotes to be near damnation, is because those who most closely received and communicated the infestations 
were injured, which is signified by their being beaten by the taskmasters (n. 7136), and because through the falsities that were continually injected they were infested even to despair (n. 
7147). Hence it is that by "they saw that they were in evil" is signified that they perceived themselves to be near damnation. For as those who are in despair suppose that they can no longer endure the 
assaults, they think that they must needs deliver themselves up as captives to falsities, such being the state of despair; but then they begin to be relieved, and to be led as it were out of thick 
darkness into light. </p>

'And the officers of the children of Israel saw themselves to be in evil' means being close to damnation. This is clear from the meaning of 'seeing' as discerning, dealt with in <a href="2150.htm">2150</a>, <a href="3764.htm">3764</a>, <a href="4567.htm">4567</a>, <a href="4723.htm">4723</a>, <a href="5400.htm">5400</a>; from the meaning of 'the officers' as those in the nearest position to receive  molestations and pass them on, dealt with in <a href="7111.htm">7111</a>, <a href="7136.htm">7136</a>; and from the meaning of 'evil' as damnation, for regarded 
in itself evil is hell, <a href="6279.htm">6279</a>, thus damnation. The reason why 'being in evil' means being close to damnation is that those who were in the nearest position to receive the molestations and pass them 
on suffered harm, meant by their being beaten by the taskmasters, <a href="7136.htm">7136</a>, and that the molestation of falsities that were constantly introduced brought them even to the point of despair, <a href="7147.htm">7147</a>. So it is 
that 'they saw themselves to be in evil' means their discernment that they were close to damnation. For because those who are at the point of despair suppose that they can no longer withstand the attacks 
made on them, they think that they cannot do anything else but surrender like prisoners to falsities. This is what the state of despair is like; yet in that state they begin to be lifted out of it 
and be led so to speak from thick darkness into light. </p>

`Et viderunt moderatores filiorum Israelis semet in malo': quod significet quod prope damnationem, constat ex significatione `videre' quod sit appercipere, de qua n. 2150, 3764, 4567, 4723, 5400; ex 
significatione `moderatorum' quod sint qui infestationes proxime recipiunt et communicant, de qua n. 7111, 7136; et ex significatione `mali' quod sit damnatio; nam malum in se spectatum est infernum, 
n. 6279, ita damnatio.  Quod `esse in malo' sit esse prope damnationem, est quia illi qui infestationes proxime receperunt et communicarunt fuerint laesi, quod significatur per quod `percussi sint ab 
exactoribus,' n. 7136, et quod per falsa continue injecta {1} usque ad desperationem {2}sint infestati, n. 7147; inde est quod per `viderunt semet in malo' significetur quod apperciperent se prope damnationem 
esse; qui enim in desperatione {3}sunt, quia insultus non amplius se sustinere posse putant, cogitant quod non possint aliter quam se tradere falsis sicut captivos, nam talis status est desperationis, 
sed tunc incipiunt illi sublevari, et duci quasi e caligine {4} in lucem. 	@1 i sic$ 	@2 infestarentur A, sint infesta I$ 	@3 This and other verbs to end of   are all singular in A.$ 	@4
