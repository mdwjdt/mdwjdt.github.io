<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>245.</strong>对于“蛇受咒诅，比一切的牲畜和田间的走兽更甚”表示感官与属天之性颠倒，转向肉体，自招咒诅，这从圣经的内义可知。耶和华神，亦即主，从不咒诅任何人。他不发怒，不试探，不惩罚，更别说咒诅。这一切都来自魔鬼，因为它不可能出于慈悲、平安、良善之源。<br />圣经多处说耶和华神转脸，发怒，施罚，试探，乃至毁灭、咒诅，这是为了叫人相信主掌管、安排宇宙万有，就连罪恶、惩罚、试探也在他掌握之中。人若接受这种笼统的观念，以后就可以学习主是如何通过将惩罚和试探转变为良善来掌管、安排宇宙万有的。教导和学习圣经，必须从笼统的真理开始。正因如此，圣经字面的意思尽是这种笼统性的真理。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]245.</strong> The inner sense of the Word establishes fairly clearly the symbolism of he said to the snake, "A curse on you, above every beast and above every wild animal of the field!" The meaning is that the sensory level of their mind turned away from what was heavenly toward what was bodily, damning itself, or bringing a curse on itself. Jehovah God — the Lord — never curses anyone, is never angry at anyone, never leads anyone into crisis. He does not even punish us, let alone curse us. It is the Devil's crew that does such things. Nothing of the sort could ever come from the fountain of mercy, peace, and goodness.{*1} This passage and many others in the Word describe Jehovah God as not only turning his face away, being angry, punishing, and testing, but even killing — and, yes, cursing.{*2} This was in order to foster the belief that the Lord controls and arranges every last detail in the universe, including evil itself, punishments, and times of trial. After accepting this very general idea, people would learn just how he controls and arranges things. They would see that he transforms the evil involved in punishment and in our ordeals into good.<br />All scriptural teaching and learning begins with the most general things; for this reason the literal meaning abounds in broad ideas.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg here states what will become a recurring if minor theme of his theology: The common biblical description of divine action in the language of human emotion is in fact merely a subjective redescription in terms we understand rather than an objective statement about the nature of the divine. (Among many passages, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_245/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_357" target=_top>357</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_245/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_588" target=_top>588:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_245/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1093" target=_top>1093</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_245/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1408#subsection-2-3" target=_top>1408:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_245/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1874" target=_top>1874</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_245/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2553" target=_top>2553</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_245/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3425#subsection-2-4" target=_top>3425:4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_245/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3605#subsection-2-4" target=_top>3605:4</a> could be cited; for a fuller list, see Swedenborg's references to Secrets of Heaven in the footnote to <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_245/swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_545" target=_top>Heaven and Hell 545</a>.) This preliminary instance of the theme is unusual in its ascription of evil events to "the Devil's crew," a phrase that must be taken figuratively, as Swedenborg does not subscribe to the notion of the Devil as an independent being (see note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_245/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_154" target=_top>154</a>). His reiterated denial of the anger of God is a response both to the frequency of such anthropomorphizing in the Bible and to the criticisms of contemporary atheists and Deists (see note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_245/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_179" target=_top>179</a>) that the God of the Bible is implausibly capricious and unforgiving. These critics cited instances of an apparently cruel and wrathful God in the Bible, or the sanctioning of cruel human conduct by God, as evidence that the Scriptures were not divine revelation but the product of human minds.

That "He said to the serpent, Thou art cursed above every beast, and above every wild animal of the field" signifies that the sensuous part averted itself from that which is heavenly, turned itself to 
that which is of the body, and thus cursed itself, may be clearly shown from the internal sense of the Word. Jehovah God or the Lord never curses anyone. He is never angry with anyone, never leads anyone 
into temptation, never punishes anyone, and still less does He curse anyone. All this is done by the infernal crew, for such things can never proceed from the Fountain of mercy, peace, and goodness. 
The reason of its being said, both here and in other parts of the Word, that Jehovah God not only turns away His face, is angry, punishes, and tempts, but also kills and even curses, is that men 
may believe that the Lord governs and disposes all and everything in the universe, even evil itself, punishments, and temptations; and when they have received this most general idea, may afterwards learn 
how He governs and disposes all things by turning the evil of punishment and of temptation into good. In teaching and learning the Word, the most general truths must come first; and therefore the 
literal sense is full of such things. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 245</b></p><p><b>245.</b>
'He said to the serpent, Cursed are you, more than every beast and more than every wild animal of the field' means that the sensory part turned away from the heavenly and towards the bodily, and in so 
doing brought condemnation, that is, a curse, upon itself. This becomes quite clear from the internal sense of the Word. Jehovah God or the Lord never curses anyone, is never angry with anyone, never 
leads anyone into temptation, and never punishes, let alone curses anybody. It is the devil's crew who do such things. Such things cannot possibly come from the fountain of mercy, peace, and goodness. 
The reason why here and elsewhere in the Word it is said that Jehovah God not only turns His face away, is angry, punishes, and tempts, but also slays and even curses, is that people may believe that 
the Lord rules over and disposes every single thing in the whole world, including evil itself, punishments, and temptations. And after people have grasped this very general concept, they may then learn 
in what ways He rules and disposes, and how He converts into good the evil inherent in punishment and the evil inherent in temptation. In teaching and learning the Word very general concepts have 
to come first; and therefore the sense of the letter is full of such general concepts. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 245</b>
</p><b>245.</b>
Quod 'dixerit ad serpentem, Maledictus tu prae omni bestia et prae omni fera agri' significet quod sensuale averterit se a caelesti et converterit se ad corporeum, ac ita semet damnaverit seu sibi maledixerit, 
constare satis potest a sensu interno Verbi; Jehovah Deus seu Dominus nunquam alicui maledicit, nunquam alicui irascitur, nunquam aliquem in tentationem inducit, nullum punit, minus maledicit; 
sed quod diabolica turba talia faciat; a fonte misericordiae, pacis et bonitatis, talia nusquam venire possunt. At quod hic et passim in Verbo dicatur quod Jehovah Deus non solum avertat facies, 
irascatur, puniat, tentet, sed etiam occidat, immo maledicat, est causa ut crederent quod Dominus omnia et singula in universo regat et disponat, etiam ipsum malum, poenas, tentationes; et postquam communissimam 
hanc ideam acceperint, quod dein discerent quomodo regit et disponit, et quod malum poenae et malum tentationis vertat in bonum: ordo docendi et discendi in Verbo est a communissimis; quare 
sensus litterae communissimis talibus abundat. </p>
