<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1460节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1460.</strong>“那地遭遇饥荒”表主在孩童时仍缺乏认知。这从前面所述清楚可知。童年时期，人所具有的认知并非出自内在事物，而是出自感官，尤其出自听觉。因为如前所述，外在人中有被称为记忆之物的接受容器。如众所周知的，这些容器是藉着认知形成的，也就是内在人流入并帮助形成的。所以，对认知的学习及其在记忆中的植入是照着内在人的流入程度进行的。主在孩童时的情形也是如此，因为祂象其他人一样出生，并和其他人一样接受教导。但对祂而言，内层是属天的，它们使得容器适合接受认知，之后，这些认知就变成接受神性的容器。祂的内层是神性，来自耶和华祂的父，而外层是人性，来自玛利亚祂的母亲。由此清楚可知，和所有其他人一样，主在孩童时，其外在人中缺乏认知。<br />“饥荒”表缺乏认知，这从圣言别处清楚可知。如以赛亚书：<br />他们不顾念耶和华的作为，也不留心祂手所做的。所以我的百姓因无知而流亡。他们的尊贵人甚是饥饿，群众极其干渴。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.12.htm">5:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.13.htm">13</a>）<br />“尊贵人甚是饥饿”表缺乏属天的认知，“群众极其干渴”表缺乏属灵的认知。耶利米书：<br />关乎耶和华他们说了虚谎的话，这并不是祂，灾祸必不临到我们，刀剑和饥荒，我们也看不见。先知必成为风，道也不在他们里面。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶5.12.htm">5:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶5.13.htm">13</a>）<br />“刀剑和饥荒”表被夺去对真理和良善的认知。“先知”表那些教导的人，“道不在他们里面”。“被刀剑和饥荒烧毁”表被夺去对真理和良善的认知，这些与荒凉有关，“刀剑”涉及属灵事物，“饥荒”涉及属天事物，这从圣言的很多部分清楚可知（如耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶14.13.htm">14:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶14.16.htm">16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶14.18.htm">18</a>；耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀4.9.htm">4:9</a>等等）。<br />在以西结书中也是如此：<br />我要加增你们的饥荒，断绝你们所倚靠的粮食；要使饥荒和恶兽到你那里，叫你丧子。我也要使刀剑临到你。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结5.16.htm">5:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结5.17.htm">17</a>）<br />“饥荒”表丧失属天的认知，或对良善的认知，由此出现虚假与邪恶。诗篇：<br />他命饥荒降在那地上，将所倚靠的粮食全行断绝。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗105.16.htm">105:16</a>）<br />“将所倚靠的粮食全行断绝”表正丧失属天的滋养，因为维持善灵和天使生命的粮食仅仅是对良善和真理的认知，以及良善和真理本身。饥荒和粮食的内义就源于此。<br />祂使渴慕的灵魂得以满足，使饥饿的灵魂得饱美物。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗107.9.htm">107:9</a>）<br />这表示那些渴求认知的人。耶利米哀歌：<br />你的孩童在各街头受饿发昏，你要为他们的性命向主举手祷告。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.19.htm">2:19</a>）<br />“受饿”表缺乏认知，“街”表真理。以西结书：<br />他们要安然居住，无人惊吓。我必给他们兴起有名的植物，他们在境内不再为饥荒所灭。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结34.28.htm">34:28</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结34.29.htm">29</a>）<br />这表示他们不再丧失对良善和真理的认知。<br />启示录：<br />他们不再饥、不再渴。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启7.16.htm">7:16</a>）<br />这论及主的国，“不再饥”表他们在那里拥有充足的一切属天认知和良善，“不再渴”表拥有充足的属灵认知和真理。主在约翰福音中说过类似的话：<br />我就是生命的粮，到我这里来的，必定不饿；信我的，永远不渴。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.35.htm">6:35</a>）<br />路加福音：<br />你们饥饿的人有福了，因为你们将要饱足！（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路6.21.htm">6:21</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />叫饥饿的得饱美食。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.53.htm">1:53</a>）<br />这论及属天的良善和对这些的认知。“饥荒”表缺乏认知，这一点明显可见于阿摩司书中的一段经文：<br />看哪，日子将到，我必命饥荒降在地上。人饥饿非因无饼，干渴非因无水，乃因不听耶和华的话。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩8.11.htm">8:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩8.12.htm">12</a>）</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1460.</strong> The symbolism of there was famine in the land as the scarcity of knowledge that still affected the Lord when he was young can be seen from remarks above.{*1} In our youth, the knowledge we have never comes from inside but from the objects of the senses, especially from what we hear. As noted [搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1460/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1458#subsection-2-5" target=_top>1458:5</a>], our outer self contains receiving vessels, which are called vessels of memory. Knowledge forms these vessels, as anyone can see, and does so under the influence and with the help of the inner self. So knowledge is learned and planted in the memory to the extent that the inner self exerts an influence. This was true for the Lord too, when he was young, because he was born like the rest of us and was taught like the rest of us. His inner capacities, however, were heavenly ones, which adapted the vessels so that they could receive knowledge, and so that the various points of knowledge could then become vessels for receiving divinity. His inner aspects were divine ones from Jehovah, his Father; his outer aspects were human ones from Mary, his mother.<br />This demonstrates that in the Lord, just as in other people, the outer self suffered a shortage of knowledge in his youth.<br />[2] The symbolism of a famine as a scarcity of knowledge can be seen in other passages of the Word. In Isaiah, for example:<br />The work of Jehovah they do not examine, and the product of his hands they do not see. Therefore my people will go into exile because they lack knowledge. And their nobility will be victims of famine; and their multitude will be parched with thirst. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1460/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_5_12-13" target=_top>Isaiah 5:12-13</a>)<br />Victims of famine stand for a dearth of heavenly knowledge; a multitude parched with thirst stands for a dearth of spiritual knowledge. In Jeremiah:<br />They lied against Jehovah and said, "He does not exist, and evil will not come on us, and sword and famine we will not see. And the prophets will become wind, and no word will come to them." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1460/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_5_12-13" target=_top>Jeremiah 5:12-13</a>)<br />Sword and famine stand for being deprived of the knowledge of truth and goodness. The prophets stand for people who teach but do not have "the word" in them. Passages throughout the Word show that being devoured by sword and famine is being deprived of the knowledge of truth and goodness. They also show that sword and famine are purgative; a sword is that which purges our spiritual elements, while famine is that which purges our heavenly elements. Examples are <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1460/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_14_13" target=_top>Jeremiah 14:13</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1460/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_14_14" target=_top>14</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1460/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_14_15-16" target=_top>15-16</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1460/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_14_18" target=_top>18</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1460/bible_king-james-version_lamentations_4_9" target=_top>Lamentations 4:9</a>; and so on.<br />[3] Ezekiel contains another example:<br />And more famine I will bring on you, and I will break the staff of bread for you.{*2} And I will send famine on you, and the evil wild animal, and they will bereave you; and a sword I will bring on you. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1460/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_5_16-17" target=_top>Ezekiel 5:16-17</a>)<br />Famine stands for being bereft of heavenly knowledge, or of the knowledge of what is good. The result is falsity and evil. In David:<br />And [Jehovah] called down a famine on the land; the whole staff of bread he broke. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1460/bible_king-james-version_psalms_105_16" target=_top>Psalms 105:16</a>)<br />Breaking the staff of bread stands for being deprived of heavenly nourishment. For good spirits and angels, no other bread sustains life than the knowledge of what is good and true, and goodness and truth itself. This fact leads to the inner-level symbolism of famine and bread. In the same author:<br />He has satisfied the longing soul, and the starving soul he has filled with good [food]. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1460/bible_king-james-version_psalms_107_9" target=_top>Psalms 107:9</a>)<br />The starving soul stands for people who desire knowledge. In Jeremiah:<br />Lift the palms of your hands over the soul of your children, who faint with hunger at the head of all your streets. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1460/bible_king-james-version_lamentations_2_19" target=_top>Lamentations 2:19</a>)<br />Hunger stands for a lack of knowledge, and streets for truth. In Ezekiel:<br />They will live securely, and no one to terrify them. And I will raise a sapling up for them, for a name, and they will no longer be devoured by the famine in the land. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1460/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_34_28-29" target=_top>Ezekiel 34:28-29</a>)<br />This stands for the fact that they will no longer be deprived of the knowledge of goodness and truth.<br />[4] In John:<br />They will no longer starve and no longer thirst. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1460/bible_king-james-version_revelation_7_16" target=_top>Revelation 7:16</a>)<br />This is speaking of the Lord's kingdom, whose inhabitants enjoy a wealth of all heavenly knowledge and benefits (no starving) and a wealth of spiritual knowledge and truth (no thirst). The Lord likewise said in John:<br />I am the bread of life; no one who comes to me will starve and no one who believes in me will ever thirst. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1460/bible_king-james-version_john_6_35" target=_top>John 6:35</a>)<br />In Luke:<br />Fortunate are those of you who starve now, because you will be satisfied. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1460/bible_king-james-version_luke_6_21" target=_top>Luke 6:21</a>)<br />In the same author:<br />The starving he has filled with good [food]. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1460/bible_king-james-version_luke_1_53" target=_top>Luke 1:53</a>)<br />This passage speaks of heavenly good and the knowledge of that good. The symbolism of famine as a scarcity of knowledge is mentioned openly in Amos:<br />Watch! The days are coming, and I will send famine into the land; not starvation for bread, and not thirst for water, but for hearing Jehovah's words. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1460/bible_king-james-version_amos_8_11-12" target=_top>Amos 8:11-12</a>)<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} It is not clear what passages Swedenborg is referring to when he mentions previous remarks on a lack of knowledge in the Lord's early life, but he may perhaps intend 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1460/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1450" target=_top>1450-1451</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1460/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453" target=_top>1453:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1460/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1457" target=_top>1457</a>.

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1460</b></p><p><b>1460.</b>
There was a famine in the land. That this signifies a scarcity of knowledges as yet with the Lord when a child, is evident from what has been already said. During childhood the knowledges in a man never 
come from that which is interior, but from the objects of the senses, especially from the hearing. For, as before said, there are in the external man receiving vessels, called the things of the memory, 
and these are formed by means of knowledges-as everybody may know-the internal man flowing in and helping; consequently knowledges are learned and are implanted in the memory in accordance with 
the influx of the internal man. Thus also was it with the Lord when He was a child-for He was born as are other men and was instructed as are other men-but with Him the interiors were celestial, which 
adapted the vessels for the reception of the knowledges, and in such a way that the knowledges should afterwards become vessels to receive the Divine. The interiors with Him were Divine, from Jehovah 
His Father; the exteriors were human, from Mary His mother. Hence it may be seen that with the Lord, equally as with other men, there was in His external man, during His childhood, a scarcity of knowledges. 
 [2] That "famine" signifies a scarcity of knowledges, is evident from the Word in other places, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     They do not look into the work of Jehovah, and see not the doing of His hands. 
Therefore My people go into captivity because they have no knowledge [cognitio], and their glory are mortals of famine, and their multitude are parched with thirst (Isa. 5:12-13); </p>
<p>"mortals of famine" 
denote a scarcity of the knowledges of celestial things; a "multitude parched with thirst," a scarcity of the knowledges of spiritual things. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     They have lied against Jehovah, and 
have said, It is not He; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine; and the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them (Jer. 5:12-13); </p>
<p>"sword and famine" 
denote the deprivation of the knowledges of truth and of good; "the prophets" are those who teach, in whom the word is not. That "to be consumed by the sword and famine," is to be deprived of the knowledges 
of truth and of good; and that vastation is denoted, by "the sword" as to spiritual things, and by "famine" as to celestial things, is evident in various places in the Word (as Jer. 14:13-16, 18; 
Lam. 4:9; and elsewhere).  [3] So too in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     And I will increase famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread; and I will send upon you famine, and the evil wild beast; and they 
shall bereave thee, and I will bring the sword upon thee (Ezek. 5:16-17); </p>
<p>"famine" denotes the deprivation of the knowledges of celestial things, or of the knowledges of good, whence come falsities and 
evils. In David: </p>
<p>     And He called for a famine upon the land, He broke the whole staff of bread (Ps. 105:16); </p>
<p>"to break the staff of bread," signifies to be deprived of heavenly food; for the life 
of good spirits and angels is sustained by no other food than the knowledges of good and truth, and the goods and truths themselves, whence comes the signification of "famine" and of "bread," in the 
internal sense. Again: </p>
<p>     He hath satisfied the longing soul, and hath filled the hungry soul with good (Ps. 107:9); </p>
<p>denoting those who desire knowledges. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Lift up thy hands for 
the soul of thy young children, who faint for hunger at the head of all the streets (Lam. 2:19); </p>
<p>"hunger" denotes the lack of knowledges; "the streets," truths. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     They shall dwell 
confidently, and none to make afraid.* And I will raise up for them a plant for a name, and they shall be no more consumed with famine in the land (Ezek. 34:28-29), denoting that they shall no longer 
be made destitute of the knowledges of good and truth.  [4] In John: </p>
<p>     They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore (Rev. 7:16); </p>
<p>concerning the Lord's kingdom, where there is an abundance 
of all celestial knowledges and goods, which is "not to hunger;" and of spiritual knowledges and truths, which is "not to thirst." In like manner spoke the Lord in John: </p>
<p>     I am the Bread of life he 
that cometh to Me shall never hunger, and he that believeth on Me shall never thirst (John 6:35). And in Luke: </p>
<p>     Blessed are ye that hunger now, for ye shall be filled (Luke 6:21). And again: </p>
<p> 
    He hath filled the hungry with good things (Luke 1:53); </p>
<p>where celestial goods and their knowledges are treated of. That "famine" signifies a scarcity of knowledges, is plainly said in Amos: </p>
<p>  
   Behold, the days are coming, that I will send a famine upon the land; not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for waters, but of hearing the words of Jehovah (Amos 8:11-12). * The Latin says, "None doing 
good," but benefaciens is evidently a misprint for terrefaciens, as it reads correctly in Apocalypse Explained, 388:8, 650:51. [Reviser.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1460</b></p><p><b>1460.</b>
That 'there was a famine in the land' means a lack of cognitions which still existed with the Lord when He was a boy is clear from what has been stated already. In childhood the cognitions that reside 
with man never come from that which is interior but from the objects of the senses, most of all from hearing; for, as has been stated, with the external man there are recipient vessels which are called 
those of the memory. Those vessels, as anyone may know, are formed by means of cognitions, the internal man flowing in and assisting that formation. Consequently the learning of cognitions and their 
implantation in the memory take place in the measure that the internal man is flowing in. So also with the Lord when a boy, for He was born as any other and received instruction as any other. But in 
His case the interiors were celestial, which fashioned the vessels to receive cognitions, and after that these cognitions to become vessels for receiving the Divine. The interiors with Him were Divine, 
being from Jehovah His Father, but the exteriors were human, being from Mary His mother. From this it becomes clear that in childhood a lack of cognitions within His external man existed with the 
Lord as much as with all others. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That 'famine' means a lack of cognitions is clear from elsewhere in the Word, as in Isaiah, </p>
<p>They do not look closely at the work of Jehovah, and they do not 
regard what His hands have done. Therefore My people will go into exile because they have no knowledge, and their honourable men will be famished,' and their multitude parched with thirst. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%205:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 5:12, 13</a>. </p>
<p>'Honourable men famished<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> stands for a lack of celestial cognitions, 'multitude parched with thirst' for a lack of spiritual cognitions. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
They have lied against Jehovah and said, 
It is not He; and no evil will come upon us; neither shall we see sword and famine. And the prophets will become wind, and the word is not in them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%205:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 5:12, 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Sword and famine' stands for becoming 
robbed of cognitions of truth and good. 'Prophets' stands for those who teach, in whom 'the word is not'. That 'being consumed by sword and famine' means becoming robbed of cognitions of truth and 
good, and that these have to do with vastation, 'sword' as to spiritual things, 'famine' as to celestial things, is clear from many parts of the Word, such as <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2014:13-16,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 14:13-16, 18</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lam%204:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lam 4:9</a>; and elsewhere. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
So also in Ezekiel, </p>
<p>I will bring more famine upon you, and will break for you the staff of bread; and I will send famine and evil beasts upon you, and they will rob you of your children. 
And I will bring the sword upon you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%205:16,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 5:16, 17</a>. </p>
<p>'Famine' stands for when one has been robbed of celestial cognitions, or cognitions of good, and therefore falsities and evils occur. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
And 
He summoned a famine over the land, He broke every staff of bread. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20105:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 105:16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Breaking the staff of bread' stands for being deprived of celestial nourishment, for the life of good spirits 
and of angels is sustained by no other food than cognitions of good and truth, and by goods and truths themselves. This is the origin of the meaning in the internal sense of famine and bread. In the 
same author, </p>
<blockquote>
He has satisfied the longing soul, and the hungry soul He has filled with good. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20107:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 107:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This stands for those desiring cognitions. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Lift up your hands for the soul 
of your little children who faint from famine at the head of every street. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lam%202:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lam 2:19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Famine' stands for an absence of cognitions, 'streets' for truths. In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
They will dwell securely and 
not be made afraid; and I shall raise up for them a plant for renown, and they will no more be consumed with famine in the land. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2034:28,%2029&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 34:28, 29</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This stands for their being deprived no longer of 
the cognitions of good and truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In John, </p>
<blockquote>
They will not hunger any more, nor thirst any more. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%207:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 7:16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord's kingdom where they have an abundance of all celestial 
cognitions and goods, meant by 'not hungering', and of spiritual cognitions and truths, meant by 'not thirsting'. The Lord said something similar, in John, </p>
<blockquote>
I am the Bread of life; he who comes to 
Me will not hunger, and he who believes in Me will never thirst. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%206:35&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 6:35</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
Blessed are you that hunger now, for you will be satisfied. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%206:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 6:21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
He has filled 
the hungry with good things. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%201:53&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 1:53</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to celestial goods and the cognitions of these. In Amos there is a plain statement that 'famine' means the lack of cognitions, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, the days 
are coming, when I will send a famine on the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%208:11,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 8:11, 12</a>.

</p><b>1460.</b>
'Fuit fames in terra':  quod significet penuriam cognitionum quae adhuc apud Dominum cum puer, constat ex illis quae prius dicta sunt; cognitiones apud hominem nusquam veniunt in pueritia ex interiore, 
sed ab objectis sensuum, cumprimis ab auditione; sunt enim, ut dictum, apud externum hominem vasa recipientia, quae vocantur memoriae; illa formantur per cognitiones, ut cuivis notum esse potest, 
interno homine influente et adjuvante; proinde cognitiones discuntur et implantantur memoriae secundum influxum interni hominis; ita quoque apud Dominum cum puer, nam natus est sicut alius homo et instructus 
ut alius; sed interiora apud Ipsum fuerunt caelestia, quae aptabant vasa ut reciperentur cognitiones, et ut cognitiones fierent dein vasa ad recipiendum Divinum; interiora apud Ipsum erant Divina 
ex Jehovah Patre Ipsius, exteriora erant humana ex Maria matre Ipsius:  inde constare potest quod apud Dominum aeque sicut apud alios homines penes externum Ipsius hominem in pueritia fuerit penuria 
cognitionum.  [2] Quod 'fames' significet penuriam cognitionum, constat ex Verbo alibi, ut apud Esaiam, Opus Jehovae non introspiciunt, et factum manuum Ipsius non vident, propterea exulabit populus 
Meus ob non cognitionem, et gloria ejus mortales famis, et multitudo illius sicca siti, v [12], 13; </p>
<p>'{1}mortales famis' pro penuria cognitionum caelestium, 'multitudo sicca siti' pro penuria cognitionum 
spiritualium:  apud Jeremiam, Mentiti sunt in Jehovam, et dixerunt, Non Ipse, et non veniet super nos malum, ac gladium et famem non videbimus; et prophetae erant in ventum, et verbum non iis, 
v 12, 13; </p>
<p>'Gladius et fames' pro orbari cognitionibus veri et boni:  'prophetae' pro iis qui docent, in quibus 'non verbum':  quod 'gladio et fame consumi' sit orbari cognitionibus veri et boni, et 
quod sint vastationis, 'gladius' quoad spiritualia, 'fames' quoad caelestia, constat passim in Verbo, ut Jer. xiv 13-16, 18, Thren. iv 9, et alibi; [3] ut quoque apud Ezechielem, Et famem addam super 
vos, et frangam vobis baculum panis; et mittam super vos famem, et feram malam, et orbabunt te,... et gladium adducam super te, v 16 [17]; </p>
<p>'fames' pro orbatione cognitionum caelestium seu cognitionum 
boni, inde falsa et mala:  apud Davidem, Et vocavit famem super terram, omnem baculum panis fregit, Ps. cv 16; </p>
<p>'baculum panis frangere' pro privari victu caelesti; vita enim spirituum bonorum et angelorum 
non alio cibo sustentatur quam cognitionibus boni et veri, ipsisque bonis et veris, inde significatio famis et panis in sensu interno:  apud eundem, Saturavit animam appetentem, et animam famelicam 
implevit bono, Ps. cvii 9; </p>
<p>pro desiderantibus cognitiones:  apud Jeremiam, Tolle volas tuas super animam infantum tuorum, qui deficiunt fame in capite omnium platearum, Thren. ii 19; </p>
<p>'fames' 
pro defectu cognitionum, 'plateae' pro veritatibus: apud Ezechielem, Habitabunt confidenter, et non (x)terrefaciens, et suscitabo illis plantam in nomen, et non erunt amplius consumpti fame in terra, 
xxxiv 28, 29; </p>
<p>[4] pro quod non amplius destituentur cognitionibus boni et veri:  apud Johannem, Non esurient amplius, nec sitient amplius, Apoc. vii 16; </p>
<p>de regno Domini, ubi in abundantia omnium 
cognitionum et bonorum caelestium, quod est 'non esurire,' et cognitionum ac veritatum spiritualium, quod est 'non sitire.'  Similiter Dominus dixit, apud Johannem, Ego, sum Panis vitae, qui venit ad 
Me, non esuriet, et qui credit in Me, non sitiet unquam, vi 35: </p>
<p>apud Lucam, Beati esurientes nunc, quia saturabimini, vi 21:  apud eundem, Esurientes implevit bonis, i 53; </p>
<p>ubi de bonis caelestibus 
et illorum cognitionibus.  Quod 'fames' significet penuriam cognitionum, manifeste dicitur apud Amos, Ecce dies venientes, et mittam famem in terram, non famem ad panem, et non sitim ad aquas, sed 
ad audiendum verba Jehovae, viii 11, 12. @1 mortales for Heb.      (methim) = 'men, males.'  S. has mortales for methim also in n. 4605, but in n. 5897, 8568 and 10540 he has 'homines.'$ </p>
