<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5058节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5058.</strong>还有一个人在世时相当尊贵，那时我也认识他，只是不了解他的内在品质。然而在来世，其生命状态经历众多变化后，却显明他是个骗子。在来世，有一段时间他在骗子们当中，并在那里受了艰难，于是就想和他们分开。我听他当时说，他想上天堂，并且也相信接受是靠着纯粹的怜悯。但他被告知，即便到那里，他也无法留在那里；并且他会像那些在世时垂死挣扎的人一样遭受折磨。尽管被告知这一切，他仍坚持己见，于是被允许进入一个由住在前方头顶上的简单善人所组成的社群。可一进入这个社群，他就开始照他所过的生活行诡诈、欺骗。结果，在一个小时之内，该社群里的简单善人就开始抱怨说，他正在夺走他们对良善与真理的觉知，从而夺走他们的快乐，进而摧毁他们的状态。就在这时，来自内层天堂的某种光被允许进入。在这光里，他看似一个魔鬼，鼻子上半部分因一道可怕、肮脏的伤口而丑陋不堪。他也开始从内在受到折磨；当他感觉到这种痛苦时，就将自己扔下地狱。由此明显可知，通向天堂的，不是靠着怜悯的拣选和接纳，而是人的生活。然而，就那些在世时接受怜悯的人而言，由良善构成的生活和由真理构成的信仰方方面面靠着怜悯。对他们来说，被接入天堂就是一种怜悯的行为，并且他们才是那被称为“选民”的人（参看<a href="3755.htm">3755</a>e，<a href="3900.htm">3900</a>节）。</p>

There was also a certain person who in the world had been a man of position, and who was then known to me, although not as to his inner quality; but in the other life, after some revolvings of the state 
of his life, it became evident that he was deceitful. When he had been for some time among the deceitful in the other life, and had suffered hard things there, he desired to be separated from them. 
I heard him then saying that he desired to come into heaven; and he too had believed that reception is of mere mercy. But he was told that if he got there he could not stay there, and that he would 
be tormented like those who in the world are in the death agony. Nevertheless he insisted, and was therefore admitted into a society consisting of the simple good who are in front above the head; but 
as soon as he arrived he began to act craftily and deceitfully, according to his life. The result was that within an hour the good in that society, who were simple, began to lament, saying that he took 
away from them their perception of good and of truth, and consequently their delight, thus destroying their state. Then some light from the interior heaven was admitted, in which he appeared as a devil, 
with the upper part of his nose loathsomely furrowed with a foul wound. He also began to be inwardly tortured; and when he felt this, he cast himself down into hell. From this it is plain that it 
is not election and reception from mercy, but the life, that makes heaven; nevertheless all things of the life of good and of the faith of truth are from mercy given to those who receive mercy in the 
world; and with these there is reception from mercy, and they are those who are called the "elect" (see n. 3755e, 3900). </p>

There was another spirit who in the world had been one of the quite distinguished. I had been acquainted with him then, though not with what he was like inwardly. In the next life however, after his 
state of life underwent a number of changes, he was shown to be deceitful. Having been some while among deceitful ones in the next life and having suffered severely there, he wished to be parted from 
them. I heard him saying at this time that he wished to enter heaven, for he too had believed that acceptance there was attributable to mercy alone. But he was told that if he entered heaven he would 
not be able to remain there and that he would suffer torment like those in the world experiencing death-throes. But in spite of being told this he persisted with his desire. He was allowed into a community 
where some of the simple good dwelt, in front overhead. But once he entered that community he began, in keeping with the life he had led, to act cunningly and deceitfully. Soon after this the simple 
good there started to complain that he was taking away their perception of what was good and true and consequently their delight, and that he was destroying their state as he did so. At that point 
some light from a more internal heaven was let in. In that light he looked like a devil, with the upper part of his nose horribly disfigured from some dreadful wound; and he also began to suffer torment 
within himself. Having experienced that torment he thrust himself away from there into hell. From this it is evident that what leads to heaven is not election and acceptance attributable to mercy, 
but a person's life. Yet every aspect of a life consisting of goodness and every aspect of a faith composed of truth is, so far as those in the world who are recipients of mercy are concerned, attributable 
to mercy. To them being accepted into heaven is an act of mercy, and these are the ones who are called the elect, <a href="3755.htm">3755</a> (end), <a href="3900.htm">3900</a>. </p>

Erat etiam quidam qui in mundo inter digniores fuerat, tunc mihi notus sed non qualis esset intus, verum in altera vita post aliquas revolutiones status ejus vitae, manifestatus quod dolosus esset; 
is cum aliquantisper inter dolosos in altera vita fuerat et ibi dura passus, voluit ab illis separari; audiebam illum (t)tunc dicentem quod vellet venire in caelum, is quoque crediderat quod solum 
esset receptio ex misericordia, sed dicebatur ei, si illuc veniret quod non posset ibi morari et quod ibi cruciaretur sicut illi qui in mundo in agone mortis sunt, sed usque instabat; is quoque 
admissus est in societatem ubi simplices boni, qui antrorsum supra caput; at cum illuc venit, secundum vitam suam incepit agere per astus et dolos; inde {1} post horulae tempus coeperunt boni ibi qui 
simplices erant, lamentari quod iis perceptionem boni et veri adimeret, (c)ac inde eorum jucundum, destruendo sic statum illorum; </p>
<p>tunc aliquid lucis a caelo interiore admittebatur, in qua apparebat {2} 
ibi sicut diabolus, et ejus nasi pars superior foede insulcata cum foedo {3} vulnere; ac coepit quoque intus cum cruciari; quod cum sensit, projecit se inde in infernum.  Inde patet quod non electo 
et receptio sit {4} ex misericordia, sed quod vita sit quae facit caelum; ast omnia vitae boni et fidei veri ex misericordia sunt illis in mundo qui (o)misericordiam recipiunt, et illis est receptio 
ex misericordia, et sunt illi qui electi vocantur, (o)n. 3755 f, 3900. </p>
