<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1793节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1793.</strong>“主耶和华（Jehovih）”是指相对于内层人的内在人。这从有关主的内在人的论述清楚可知，也就是说，这内在人就是耶和华自己，主从祂成孕，是祂的独生子，并且母体人性（maternal human），即源于母亲的人性通过试探的争战被净化后，主的人性要与祂融合。在圣言中，“主耶和华（Jehovih）”出现的频率非常高，事实上，和耶和华（Jehovah）被称为“主”的次数一样多，故祂不是被称为“主Jehovah”，而是被称为“主Jehovih”，尤其论述试探之时。如以赛亚书：<br />看哪，主耶和华（Jehovih）必像大能者临到，祂的膀臂必为祂掌权。看哪，祂的赏赐在祂那里，祂的报应在祂面前。祂必像牧人牧养自己的羊群，用膀臂聚集羊羔抱在怀中，慢慢引导那乳养小羊的。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.10.htm">40:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.11.htm">11</a>）<br />此处“主耶和华（Jehovih）必像大能者临到”论及试探争战中的胜利。“祂的膀臂必为祂掌权”表祂凭自己的力量战胜它。本章第一节所提到的“赏赐”就是此处经文所陈述的，也就是说，这赏赐就是全人类的救赎，即“祂必像牧人牧养自己的羊群，用膀臂聚集羊羔抱在怀中，慢慢引导那乳养小羊的”，所有这些事都属于至内在或神性之爱。<br />同一先知书：<br />主耶和华（Jehovih）开通我的耳朵，我并没有违背，也没有退后。我将我的背转给打击我的人，把我的腮转给扯我胡须的人；人辱我，吐我，我并不掩面。主耶和华必帮助我。看哪，主耶和华必帮助我。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛50.5.htm">50:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛50.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛50.9.htm">9</a>）<br />这明显论及试探。此外还有其它经文。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1793.</strong> The fact that the Lord Jehovih is his inner self in relation to his intermediate can be seen from previous statements about the Lord's inner self: His inner self was Jehovah himself, from whom he was conceived and whose one child he was; and his human side eventually became one with this inner self, after he purified his maternal part (everything he inherited from his mother) by means of his struggles and trials [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1793/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1414" target=_top>1414</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1793/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1444" target=_top>1444</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1793/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1573" target=_top>1573</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1793/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1602" target=_top>1602-1603</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1793/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1607" target=_top>1607</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1793/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1707#subsection-2-5" target=_top>1707:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1793/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1725#subsection-2-2" target=_top>1725:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1793/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1733#subsection-2-2" target=_top>1733:2</a>].<br />The name Lord Jehovih comes up fairly often in the Word. In fact every time Jehovah is called the Lord, the name used is not the Lord Jehovah but the Lord Jehovih, especially in passages dealing with his trials.<br />[2] In Isaiah, for instance:<br />Watch! The Lord Jehovih comes in might, and his arm is ruling for him. Look! His reward is with him and his work before him. He will pasture his flock like a shepherd; he will gather the lambs into his arm and carry them on his chest; he will lead the unweaned. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1793/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_40_10-11" target=_top>Isaiah 40:10-11</a>)<br />"The Lord Jehovih comes in might" is about victory in his spiritual battles. "His arm will rule for him" stands for the fact that he used his own power. This passage tells what the "reward" of the last verse is: the salvation of the whole human race — that is, pasturing his flock like a shepherd, gathering the lambs into his arm, carrying them on his chest, and leading the unweaned. All these are acts of the deepest love, or divine love.<br />[3] In the same author:<br />The Lord Jehovih has opened my ear for me, and I have not rebelled; I have not drawn back. My body I have given to those striking it, and my jaws to those plucking them. My face I have not hidden from their insults and spit, and the Lord Jehovih will help me. Watch: the Lord Jehovih will help me. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1793/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_50_5" target=_top>Isaiah 50:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1793/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_50_6" target=_top>6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1793/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_50_7" target=_top>7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1793/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_50_9" target=_top>9</a>)<br />This is obviously about his trials. There are other passages too. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1793</b></p><p><b>1793.</b>
That the "Lord Jehovih" is the internal man relatively to the interior, is evident from what has been said concerning the Lord's internal man, namely, that it was Jehovah Himself, from whom He was conceived, 
and whose only Son He was, and to whom the Lord's Human became united after He had by the combats of temptation purified the maternal human, that is, that which He derived from the mother. The 
appellation "Lord Jehovih" occurs very often in the Word; indeed, as often as Jehovah is called "Lord" He is not called "Lord Jehovah," but "Lord Jehovih," and this especially where temptations are 
treated of.  [2] As in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Behold, the Lord Jehovih cometh in strength, and His arm shall rule for Him; behold, His reward is with Him, and His work before Him. He shall feed His flock like 
a shepherd, He shall gather the lambs in His arm, and carry them in His bosom, and shall lead those that give suck (Isa. 40:10-11), where "the Lord Jehovih cometh in strength," relates to His victory 
in the combats of temptations; "His arm shall rule for Him," means that it is from His own power. What the reward is that is mentioned in the first verse of this chapter is here declared, namely, that 
it is the salvation of the whole human race, that is to say, "He feeds His flock like a shepherd, gathers the lambs in His arm, carries them in His bosom, and leads those that give suck;" all of which 
things pertain to inmost or Divine love.  [3] Again in the same Prophet: </p>
<p>     The Lord Jehovih hath opened Mine ear, and I was not rebellious; I have not turned away backward. I gave My body to 
the smiters, and My cheeks to them that plucked off the hair; I hid not My face from shame and spitting; and the Lord Jehovih will help Me; behold the Lord Jehovih will help Me (Isa. 50:5-7, 9), where 
temptations are manifestly treated of. Besides other passages. </p>

That 'the Lord Jehovih' is the Internal Man in relationship to the Interior Man is clear from what has been stated about the Lord's Internal Man, namely that it was Jehovah Himself, from whom He was 
conceived, whose only Son He was, and to whom the Lord's Human became united after the maternal human, that is, the human derived from the mother, had been purified by means of the conflicts brought about 
by temptations. In the Word 'Lord Jehovih' occurs quite often; indeed for as many times as Jehovah is called the Lord He is not named 'Lord Jehovah' but 'Lord Jehovih'; and especially so when temptations 
are the subject, as in Isaiah, </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Behold, the Lord Jehovih is coming with might, and His arm will exercise dominion for Him; behold, His reward is with Him, and His work before Him. He will 
pasture His flock like a shepherd, He will gather the lambs in His arm, and will carry them in His bosom, and will lead those that give suck. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2040:10,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 40:10, 11</a>. </p>
<p>Here 'the Lord Jehovih is coming with 
might' has reference to victory in the conflicts brought about by temptations. 'His arm will give Him dominion' stands for His winning it by His own power. What the 'reward' is that is referred to in 
the previous verse is stated here, namely that it is the salvation of the whole human race, that is, 'He pastures His flock like a shepherd, gathers the lambs in His arm, carries them in His bosom, 
and leads those giving suck', all of which things belong to inmost or Divine love. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The Lord Jehovih opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, I turned not backwards. I gave 
my body to the smiters, and my cheeks to those who pluck them. I hid not my face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> from insults and spitting; and the Lord Jehovih will help me. Behold, the Lord Jehovih will help me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2050:5-7,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 50:5-7, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This 
plainly refers to temptations. And there are other examples besides these.

Quod 'Dominus Jehovih' sit Internus respective ad Interiorem, constat ex illis quae de Interno Homine Domini dicta sunt, quod nempe fuerit Ipse Jehovah, a Quo conceptus, et cujus unicus Filius, cui 
Domini Humanum unitum factum, postquam maternum, hoc est, illud quod a matre traxit, per pugnas tentationum purificaverit; in Verbo saepius occurrit Dominus Jehovih, immo quoties Jehovah Dominus dicitur, 
appellatur non Dominus Jehovah sed Dominus Jehovih, et hoc imprimis ubi de tentationibus agitur, ut apud Esaiam, 	[2] Ecce Dominus Jehovih in forti venit, et brachium Ipsius dominans Ipsi, ecce merces 
Ipsius cum Ipso, et opus Ipsius coram Ipso; sicut pastor gregem suum pascet, in 	brachium suum colliget agnos, et in gremio suo portabit, lactentes ducet, xl 10, 11; </p>
<p>ubi 'Dominus Jehovih in forti 
venit' de victoria in pugnis tentationum: 'brachium Ipsius dominabitur Ipsi' pro quod ex propria potentia; quid 'merces,' de qua in vers. praec. hic dicitur, nempe quod salus colligat agnos, in gremio 
portet, lactentes ducat,' quae universi generis humani, hoc est, 'ut pastor gregem pascat, in brachium colligat agnos, in gremio portet, lactentes ducat,' quae omnia sunt amoris intimi seu Divini; 
[3] apud eundem, 	Dominus Jehovih aperuit mihi aurem, et ego non 	rebellavi, retro non recessi, corpus meum dedi percutientibus, et maxillas meas vellicantibus, facies meas non occultavi ab ignominiis 
et sputo, et Dominus Jehovih auxiliabitur mihi;     ecce Dominus Jehovih auxiliabitur mihi, l 5-7, 9; </p>
<p>ibi manifeste de tentationibus, praeter alibi.
