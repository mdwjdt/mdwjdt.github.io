Verses 24-26. And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die; and visiting God will visit you, and will make you go up out of this land unto the land which He sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. And 
Joseph took an oath of the sons of Israel, saying, Visiting God will visit you, and ye shall make my bones go up from hence. And Joseph died, a son of a hundred and ten years; and they embalmed him, and 
he was put in an ark in Egypt. "And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die," signifies a prediction that the internal of the church will cease; "and visiting God will visit you," signifies that the last 
time will come; "and will make you go up out of this land unto the land which He sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob," signifies that they will come to the state of the church in which the ancients 
were; "and Joseph took an oath of the sons of Israel," signifies a binding; "Visiting God will visit you," signifies when this last of the church will come; "and ye shall make my bones go up from 
hence," signifies that there will be the representative of a church, but not a representative church, which must be in the internal also; "and Joseph died," signifies that the internal of the church 
ceased to be; "a son of a hundred and ten years," signifies the state then; "and they embalmed him," signifies preservation still; "and he was put in an ark in Egypt," signifies concealment in the memory-knowledges 
of the church. </p>

Verses 24-26 And Joseph said to his brothers, I am dying; and God will certainly visit you and cause you to go up out of this land to the land which He swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And Joseph 
made the children of Israel swear, saying, God will certainly visit you, and you shall cause my bones to go up from here. And Joseph died, a hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed him, and he was 
put in an ark in Egypt. </p>
<p>'And Joseph said to his brothers, I am dying' means a foretelling that the internal of the Church is about to come to an end. 'And God will certainly visit you' means that 
the final period is about to come. 'And cause you to go up out of this land to the land which He swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob' means that they are about to come into the state of the Church that 
the ancients lived in. 'And Joseph made the children of Israel swear, saying' means an obligation. 'God will certainly visit you' means since that final period of the Church is about to come. 'And you 
shall cause my bones to go up from here' means that there will be a representative of the Church but not a representative Church which also exists on an internal level. 'And Joseph died' means that 
the internal of the Church ceased to exist. 'A hundred and ten years old' means the state at that time. 'And they embalmed him' means preservation still. 'And he was put in an ark in Egypt' means a concealment 
within the Church's factual knowledge. </p>

Vers. 24-26.  Et dixit Joseph ad fratres suos, Ego morior, et Deus visitando visitabit vos, et ascendere faciet vos e terra hac ad terram quam juravit Abrahamo, Jishako et Jacobo.  Et adjuravit Joseph 
filios Israelis, dicendo, Visitando visitabit Deus vos, et ascendere facietis ossa mea exhinc.  Et moriebatur Joseph filius centum et decem annorum; et condierunt ejus, et ponebatur in arca in Aegypto. 
 `Et dixit Joseph ad fratres suos, Ego morior' significat praedictionem quod cessaturum internum Ecclesiae; `et Deus visitando visitabit vos' significat quod ultimum tempus venturum: `et ascendere 
faciet vos e terra hac ad terram quam juravit Abrahamo, Jishako et Jacobo' significat quod ad statum Ecclesiae venturi, in quo fuerunt antiqui: `et adjuravit Joseph filios Israelis {1}dicendo', significat 
obstrictionem: `Visitando visitabit Deus vos' significat cum id ultimum Ecclesiae venturum: et ascendere facietis ossa mea exhinc' significat quod repraesentativum Ecclesiae erit, non autem Ecclesia 
repraesentativa quae etiam in interno: `et moriebatur Joseph' significat quod internum Ecclesiae cessavit esse: `filius centum et decem annorum' significat statum tunc:  `et condierunt eum' significat 
praeservationem usque:  `et ponebatur in arca in Aegypto' significat occultationem in scientificis Ecclesiae. @1 AI o here and 6590$ </p>
