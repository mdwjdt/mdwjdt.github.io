Verses 27-30. Fulfill this week, and we will give thee her also, for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years. And Jacob did so, and fulfilled this week, and he gave him Rachel 
his daughter for a woman. And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be to her for a handmaid. And he came also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with 
him yet seven other years. "Fulfill this week," signifies a succession of the study; "and we will give thee her also, for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years," signifies 
that then there would be a full state of study; "and Jacob did so, and fulfilled this week," signifies the effect of this; "and he gave him Rachel his daughter for a woman," signifies now the conjunction 
of good with the affection of interior truth; "and Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be to her for a handmaid," signifies the exterior affections which are the bonds or subservient 
means; "and he came also unto Rachel," signifies conjunction with the affection of internal truth; "and he loved also Rachel more than Leah," signifies the love of internal truth more than of 
external truth; "and served with him yet seven other years," signifies holy study. </p>

Verses 27-30 Complete this week, and we will give you this one also for the service which you render with me for another seven years. And Jacob did so, and completed this week, and he gave him Rachel 
his daughter for his wife. And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, Bilhah his servant-girl - to her to be a servant-girl. And he came [in] also to Rachel, and he loved Rachel also, more than Leah; and 
he served with him yet another seven years. </p>
<p>'Complete this week' means the continuance of the diligent effort. 'And we will give you this one also for the service which you render with me for another 
seven years' means that in that case it would be a complete state of diligent effort. 'And Jacob did so, and completed this week' means the fulfilment of these things. 'And he gave him Rachel his 
daughter for his wife' means the joining of good at that point to the affection for interior truth. 'And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, Bilhah his servant-girl - to her to be a servant-girl' means 
exterior affections which are subservient bonds or means. 'And he came [in] also to Rachel' means a joining to the affection for internal truth. 'And he loved Rachel also, more than Leah' means greater 
love for internal truth than for external. 'And he served with him yet another seven years' means holy diligent effort. </p>

Vers. 27-30. Imple septimanam hanc, et dabimus tibi etiam illam in servitium, quod servias cum me adhuc septem annis aliis. Et fecit Jacob ita, et implevit septimanam hanc, et dedit ei Rachelem, 
filiam suam ei in mulierem. Et dedit Laban Racheli filiae suae Bilham ancillam suam illi ad ancillam. Et venit etiam ad Rachelem, et amavit etiam Rachelem prae Leah; et servivit cum eo adhuc septem 
annis aliis. `Imple septimanam hanc,' significat adhuc studii successionem: `et dabimus tibi etiam illam in servitium, quod servias cum me adhuc septem annis aliis' significat quod tunc status plenus 
studii: `et fecit Jacob ita, et implevit septimanam hanc' significat effectum illorum `et dedit ei Rachelem filiam suam ei in mulierem' significat tunc conjunctionem boni cum affectione veri interioris: 
`et dedit Laban Racheli filiae suae Bilham ancillam suam illi ad ancillam' significat exteriores affectiones quae vincula seu media inservientia: `et venit etiam ad Rachelem' significat conjunctionem 
cum affectione veri interni: `et amavit etiam Rachelem prae Leah' significat amorem veri interni prae vero externo: `et servivit cum eo adhuc septem annis aliis' significat studium sanctum. </p>
