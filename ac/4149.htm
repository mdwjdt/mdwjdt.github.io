<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4149节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4149.</strong>“至于你的神明，你在谁那里搜出来，谁就在我们弟兄面前不得存活”表那真理不是“拉班的”，“拉班”的真理不可能居于“雅各的”良善中。这从“神明”的含义清楚可知，“神明”，就是此处的家中神像，是指真理（参看<a href="4111.htm">4111</a>节），然而不是属于“拉班”所表良善的真理，而是属于“拉结”所代表的情感的真理。正因这些真理在此由“神明”来表示，故经上补充说是拉结偷了它们。下文有关于它们的详细内容，如果这个行为不包含唯独显明在内义中的奥秘，经上是不会记载这些详细内容的。由于此处所论述的真理不是属于“拉班”所表良善的真理，而是属于“拉结”所代表对真理的情感的真理，故“至于你的神明，你在谁那里搜出来，谁就在我们弟兄面前不得存活”这些话表示那真理不是“拉班”的，“拉班”的真理不可能居于“雅各”的良善中。<br />关于这个奥秘，情况是这样：一切属灵良善都有自己的真理，因为该良善在哪里，它自己的真理就在哪里。就本身而言，良善是一个单一整体，但它通过真理变得多种多样。事实上，真理好比构成某种身体器官的纤维。正是这些纤维所取的形式决定了器官、因而其功能的性质。而它的功能只有凭借经由灵魂所流入的生命才能运行；而这生命就出自源于主的良善。因此，尽管良善是一个单一整体，但它因每个个体而各不相同；并且如此各异以致它永远不会在哪两个人身上是一模一样的。这也是为何一个人的真理绝无可能居于另一个人的良善中。因为凡处于良善社群的人所具有的一切真理都是互通的，并产生某种形式。因此，这个人的真理无法被转到那个人里面；它若被转入，就会进入接受者所特有的形式中，并披上不同的表象。不过，这个奥秘太深了，以至于无法用一两句话解释清楚。由此可知，没有哪两个人的心智是完全一样的；人数有多少，人之情感和思维方式的区别就有多少。这也解释了为何整个天堂由无穷多样性的天使形式组成。这些形式被主排列成天堂所取的形式，故行如一个单一整体。没有哪种单一整体由相同事物构成，而是都由形式上各不相同的事物构成；这些各种不同事物照其形式而构成一体。这一切表明“拉班”的真理无法居于“雅各”的良善中是什么意思。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4149</b></p><p><b>4149.</b>
With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall not live before our brethren. That this signifies that the truth was not his [Laban's], and that his truth could not subsist in his [Jacob's] good, is 
evident from the signification of "gods," here the teraphim, as being truths (see n. 4111), yet not the truths of the good signified by "Laban," but those of the affection represented by Rachel. As these 
truths are here signified by "gods," it is therefore stated that Rachel stole them, and more is said of them in what follows, which would not have been told if that deed had not involved arcana that 
are manifest only in the internal sense. And as the truths which are here the subject treated of are not those of the good signified by "Laban," but those of the affection of truth represented by Rachel, 
therefore by the words, "with whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall not live before our brethren," is signified that the truth was not his, and that his truth could not subsist in his [Jacob's] 
good.  [2] With this arcanum the case is this: Every spiritual good has its own truths; for where this good is, there are its truths. Regarded in itself good is one, but it becomes various by means 
of truths; for truths may be compared to the fibers that compose one of the bodily organs, in accordance with the form of which fibers there results the organ, and consequently its operation, which 
operation is effected by means of the life that flows in through the soul; and this life is from the good which is from the Lord. It is thus that good, although one, is yet various with every individual, 
so various as never to be similar in every respect with one as with another. Hence also it is that the truth of one can never subsist in the good of another. For all the truths with everyone who 
is in good communicate with one another, and produce a certain form, and therefore the truth of one cannot be transferred into another; but when it is transferred, it passes into the form of him who 
receives it, and puts on another aspect. But this arcanum is too deep to be expounded in a few words. From this it follows that the mind of one is never altogether like that of another; but that great 
as is the number of men, so great is the variety in respect to affections and thoughts; and also that the universal heaven consists of angelic forms in perpetual variety, which being disposed by the 
Lord into the heavenly form act as and produce a one. For a one is never composed of the same things, but of things various in form, which make a one according to their form. From all this it is now 
evident what is meant by his [Laban's] truth not subsisting in his [Jacob's] good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4149</b></p><p><b>4149.</b>
'Anyone with whom you find your gods shall not live in the presence of our brothers' means that that truth was not 'Laban's', and that what was 'Laban's' truth could not reside in his - 'Jacob's' - good. 
This is clear from the meaning of 'gods' which in this case are the teraphim, as truths, dealt with in <a href="4111.htm">4111</a>, not however the truths belonging to the good meant by 'Laban' but to the affection which 
'Rachel' represents. It is because those truths are meant by 'gods' here that the reference to Rachel's having stolen them is added. And more concerning them appears further on which would not have 
been recorded if that deed of hers had not entailed arcana which are evident solely in the internal sense. And because the truths under discussion here were not truths belonging to the good meant by 
'Laban' but those belonging to the affection for truth which 'Rachel' represents, the words 'Anyone with whom you find your gods shall not live in the presence of our brothers' therefore mean that that 
truth was not 'Laban's', and that what was 'Laban's' truth could not reside in his - 'Jacob's' - good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The implication of this arcanum is that all spiritual good has its own truths, for wherever 
that good exists truths are present also. Regarded in itself good is a single whole, but it is made various by means of truths. Indeed truths may be compared to the fibres which compose some organ 
of the body. It is the form which these fibres take that determines the nature of the organ and therefore of its function. And this - that is to say, its function - is dependent on the life which flows 
in through the soul, a life that comes from good which originates in the Lord. So although good is a single whole it nevertheless varies with each individual; it is so varying that it is never exactly 
the same with one person as with another. This also is why one person's truth cannot possibly abide in another person's good. For all the truths residing with someone in whom good is present intercommunicate 
and produce some form or other. For this reason one person's truth cannot be transferred to another, for when it is transferred it passes into the form that is peculiar to the recipient and 
takes on a different appearance. But this arcanum demands exploration which is too deep to enable it to be revealed in just a few words. This explains why the mind of one person is never exactly like 
another's, but that the differences in people's affections and ways of thinking are as numerous as the people themselves. It also explains why the whole of heaven consists of angelic forms which are 
endlessly varying. Arranged by the Lord into the form heaven takes, those forms act as a single whole. For no single whole is ever composed of parts that are identical but of those that are various existing 
in a single form and which make one in keeping with that form. This now shows what is meant by the statement that what was 'Laban's' truth could not reside in his own - 'Jacob's' - good. </p>

`Cum quo invenis deos tuos, non vivet coram fratribus nostris': quod significet quod verum non ejus esset, et quod ejus verum non subsisteret in suo bono, constat a significatione `deorum hic teraphim, 
quod sint vera, de qua n. 4111, at vera non boni per `Labanem' significati, sed affectionis quae per `Rachelem' repraesentatur; quia per deos {1} hic illa vera significantur, ideo memoratur 
quod `Rachel illos furata,' et de illis in sequentibus plus agitur, quod non memoratum nisi illud factum involvisset arcana quae solum patent in {2} sensu interno; et quia vera illa de quibus hic agitur, 
non boni per `Labanem' significati essent sed affectionis veri quae per `Rachelem' repraesentatur, ideo per illa verba, nempe `cum quo invenis deos tuos, non vivet coram fratribus nostris,' 
significatur quod verum non ejus esset, et quod ejus verum non subsisteret in suo bono. [2] Cum arcano hoc ita se habet: </p>
<p>omne bonum spirituale habet sua vera, nam ubi id bonum, ibi vera; </p>
<p>bonum in se 
spectatum unum est, sed varium fit per vera; vera enim comparari possunt fibris quae organum quoddam corporis componunt; </p>
<p>secundum formam fibrarum fit organum, proinde ejus operatio, quae, nempe operatio, 
fit per vitam {3} quae per animam influit, et vita a bono quod a Domino; inde est quod bonum tametsi unum, usque apud unumquemvis varium sit, et tam varium ut nusquam omnimode simile apud 
unum ut apud alterum; inde etiam est quod unius verum nusquam subsistere possit in alterius bono; omnia enim vera apud unumquemvis qui in bono est, communicant inter se et faciunt quandam formam, quare 
transferri unius verum in alterum non potest, sed cum transfertur, tunc transit in formam ejus qui recipit, et induit aliam faciem; sed hoc arcanum est altioris indaginis quam ut paucis exponi 
possit; inde est quod unius mens nusquam alterius prorsus similis sit, sed quot homines, tot alii quoad affectiones et cogitationes; tum quod universum caelum consistat ex formis angelicis quae in 
perpetua varietate sunt; quae in formam caelestem a Domino dispositae unum agunt, omne enim unum nusquam ex iisdem componitur, sed ex variis in forma, quae unum secundum formam faciunt; inde nunc 
patet quid intelligitur per quod ejus verum non subsisteret in suo bono.      @1 A d teraphim, i deos, d and i teraphim$      @2 ex$      @3 existit a vita$ </p>
