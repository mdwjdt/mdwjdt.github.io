<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3323节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3323.</strong>创世记25:31-33. 雅各说，你如今日那样把长子的名分卖给我吧。以扫说，看哪，我将要死，这长子的名分于我有什么益处呢？雅各说，你如今日那样对我起誓吧；以扫就对他起了誓，把长子的名分卖给雅各。 <br />“雅各说”表真理的教义。“你如今日那样把长子的名分卖给我吧”表短期内从表面上看，真理的教义优先。“以扫说，看哪，我将要死”表然后他会复活。“这长子的名分于我有什么益处呢”表这个时候没有必要优先。“雅各说”表真理的教义。“你如今日那样对我起誓吧；以扫就对他起了誓”表确认。“把长子的名分卖给雅各”表与此同时，优先权也让出去了。</p>

Verses 31-33. And Jacob said, Sell me as this day thy birthright. And Esau said, Behold I am going to die, and for what is this birthright to me? And Jacob said, Swear to me as this day; and he sware 
unto him, and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. "And Jacob said," signifies the doctrine of truth; "sell me as this day thy birthright," signifies that as to time the doctrine of truth was apparently 
prior; "and Esau said, Behold I am going to die," signifies that he would afterwards rise again; "and for what is this birthright to me," signifies that in this case there would be no need of priority; 
"and Jacob said," signifies the doctrine of truth; "swear to me as this day, and he swore unto him" signifies confirmation; "and he sold his birthright unto Jacob," signifies that in the meantime 
priority was granted. </p>

Verses 31-33 And Jacob said, Sell me - as if today - your birthright. And Esau said, Behold, I am going to die; so what is this birthright to me? And Jacob said, Swear to me, as if today; and he swore 
to him, and he sold his birthright to Jacob. </p>
<p>'Jacob said' means the doctrine of truth. 'Sell me - as if today - your birthright' means that in the short term the doctrine of truth was apparently 
prior. 'And Esau said, Behold, I am going to die' means that [the good of the natural] would after that rise again 'So what is this birthright to me?' means that at this time there is no need for that 
good to be prior. 'And Jacob said' means the doctrine of truth. 'Swear to me, as if today; and he swore to him' means confirmation. 'And he sold his birthright to Jacob' means that in the meantime priority 
was conceded [to the doctrine of truth]. </p>

Vers. 31-33.  Et dixit Jacob, Vende sicut hodie primogenituram tuam mihi. Et dixit Esau, Ecce ego vadens ad moriendum, et ad quid hoc mihi, primogenitura? Et dixit Jacob, Jura mihi sicut hodie, et juravit 
illi, et vendidit primogenituram suam Jacobo. `Dixit Jacob' significat doctrinam veri: `vende sicut hodie primogenituram tuam mihi' significat quod quoad tempus prior esset doctrina veri apparenter: 
`et dixit Esau, Ecce ego vadens ad moriendum' significat quod resurgeret dein: `et ad quid hoc mihi, primogenitura?' significat quod tunc non opus sit prioritate: `et dixit Jacob' significat doctrinam 
veri: `Jura mihi sicut hodie; et juravit illi' significat confirmationem: `et vendidit primogenituram suam Jacobo' significat quod prioritas interea concessa. </p>
