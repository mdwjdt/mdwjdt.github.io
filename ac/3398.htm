<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3398节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3398.</strong>“民中险些有人和你的妻子同寝，那你就给我们带来罪过了”表神圣真理有可能已经被玷污，从而被亵渎。这从“同寝”、“民中有人”、“妻子”和“罪过”的含义清楚可知：“同寝”是指被败坏或玷污；“民中有人”是指属于教会，也就是属灵教会的某个人（<a href="2928.htm">2928</a>节）；“妻子”是指神圣真理，就是此处的利百加，是指神圣真理，如前所述；“罪过”是指亵渎真理的罪责。由此明显可知，“民中险些有人和你的妻子同寝，那你就给我们带来罪过了”表教会里的某个人有可能已经轻易地玷污了神圣真理，给自己招来亵渎真理的罪责。前面已说明（<a href="3386.htm">3386</a>节） ，亚伯拉罕两次称自己的妻子为妹子，第一次在埃及，第二次在与亚比米勒共同居住的基拉耳；以撒同样称自己的妻子利百加为妹子，并且那时也是与亚比米勒住在一起，这三次都被记录在圣言中，其中的原因是一个非常深的奥秘。这些话所蕴含的真实奥秘从内义明显看出来，也就是说：“妹子”表理性真理，“妻子”表神圣真理；理性真理被如此称呼，即被称为“妹子”，是为了防止神圣真理，也就是“妻子”（即此处的利百加）被玷污，从而遭到亵渎。<br />至于对真理的亵渎，情况是这样：神圣真理绝不可能遭到亵渎，除了那些曾经承认过它的人之外。因为这些人首先通过承认和信仰进入真理，从而被引入真理。如果他们后来背离真理，那么他们里面仍继续存留着它的永恒印记，这印记会与邪恶并虚假同时被忆起。于是，这真理因附着在这些邪恶与虚假上而遭到亵渎。所以，有这种情况的人不断有遣责他们的东西、因而有自己的地狱在里面。事实上，当地狱里的人靠近良善与真理所在的气场时，他们会立刻感觉到自己的地狱，因为他们进入到自己所恨的东西中，由此进入折磨中。因此，亵渎真理的人会永远与折磨他们的东西住在一起，折磨的强度取决于亵渎的程度。正因如此，主特别规定，不可亵渎神圣良善与真理。尤其对于忍不住亵渎它们的人，主通过使他们尽可能远离对真理和良善的承认和信仰而如此规定。因为如前所述，除了曾承认并信过的人外，没有人能亵渎它们。<br />这就是为何内在真理没有被透露给雅各的后代，就是以色列人和犹太人的原因。甚至连人里面有内在事物，因而有内在敬拜也没有向他们公开，并且几乎没有告知他们有关死后生命、主的天国，或他们所期待的弥赛亚的任何事。原因在于，以色列人和犹太人具有这样的秉性，如所预见到的，一旦这些事透露给他们，他们就忍不住亵渎之，因为他们只渴望世俗事物。由于这个种族具有这样的性质，并且如今还是这种性质，故他们仍被允许根本不信内在真理。他们一旦承认，后来又反悔，就必然陷入最糟糕的地狱。<br />这也是为何在他们还具有一丝良善，甚至是属世良善之前，主没有降世揭示圣言的内在事物的原因。因为到那时，他们无法再以内在承认接受任何真理（接受真理的，是良善），从而无法亵渎它。这就是先知书大量论述的“日期满了”、“时代的终结”和“末日”所表示的状态。由于同样的原因，圣言内义的奥秘如今正被揭开，因为如今信仰也几乎不存在了，因为仁爱不存在，因此，这就是时代的终结。当出现这种情况时，这些奥秘就能被揭开，而不用冒亵渎的危险，因为它们没有从内在得到承认。<br />正是由于这个奥秘，圣言才会提到亚伯拉罕和以撒同亚比米勒住在基拉耳时，都称他们的妻子为妹子。关于这个主题，可进一步参看前面的相关阐述和说明，大意是：能亵渎的，是那些承认的人，而非那些不承认的人，更不是那些不知道的人（<a href="593.htm">593</a>，<a href="1008.htm">1008</a>，<a href="1010.htm">1010</a>，<a href="1059.htm">1059</a>节）。亵渎圣物和圣言何等危险（<a href="571.htm">571</a>，<a href="582.htm">582</a>节）。教会中人能亵渎圣物，教会外的人则不能（<a href="2051.htm">2051</a>节）。主规定不可出现亵渎的情况（<a href="1001.htm">1001</a>，<a href="2426.htm">2426</a>节）。敬拜变得外在，是为了防止亵渎内在敬拜（<a href="1327.htm">1327</a>，<a href="1328.htm">1328</a>节）。人们被保守在无知中，是为了防止信之真理遭到亵渎（<a href="301.htm">301</a>-<a href="303.htm">303</a>节）。</p>

That one of the people might lightly have lain with thy woman, and thou wouldst have brought guilt upon us. That this signifies that Divine truth might have been adulterated and thus profaned, is evident 
from the signification of "lying with," as being to be perverted or adulterated; from the signification of "one of the people," as being some one of the spiritual church (n. 2928); from the signification 
of "woman" who here is Rebekah, as being Divine truth (concerning which see above); and from the signification of "guilt," as being the blame of the profanation of truth; so that by "one of the 
people might lightly have lain with thy woman, and thou wouldst have brought guilt upon us," is signified that someone of the church might easily have adulterated Divine truth, and have brought upon 
himself the blame of the profanation of truth. It was said above (n. 3386) that as Abraham twice called his wife Sarah his sister, first in Egypt, and afterwards in Gerar with Abimelech; and that as 
Isaac in like manner called his woman Rebekah his sister, also with Abimelech; and as these three cases are recorded in the Word, there must be some very deep secret involved thereby. This very secret 
is seen in the internal sense, namely, that by "sister" is signified rational truth, and by "woman" Divine truth; and this was called rational truth (that is, "sister"), lest Divine truth (here called 
the "woman" who was Rebekah) should be adulterated, and thus profaned.  [2] In regard to the profanation of truth the case is this: Divine truth cannot possibly be profaned except by those who have 
first acknowledged it; for when those who have first entered into truth by acknowledgment and belief, and have thus been initiated into it, afterwards recede from it, there continually remains an impression 
of it stamped within, which is recalled at the same time with the falsity and evil; and hence by adhering to these the truth is profaned. Therefore those with whom this is the case have continually 
in themselves that which condemns them; thus their own hell; for when the infernals approach a sphere where good and truth are, they are instantly sensible of their own hell, because they come 
into that which they hold in hatred, consequently into torment. Therefore those who have profaned truth dwell continually with that which torments them, and this according to the degree of the profanation. 
For this reason it is most especially provided by the Lord that Divine good and truth may not be profaned; and this is provided chiefly by the circumstance that the man who is such that he cannot 
but profane is withheld as far as possible from the acknowledgment and belief of truth and good; for as before said no one can profane except the man who has first acknowledged and believed. [3] This 
was the reason why internal truths were not disclosed to Jacob's descendants the Israelites and Jews, who were not openly told even that there is anything internal in man, thus that there is any internal 
worship; and scarcely anything was said to them about the life after death, and the Lord's heavenly kingdom; or about the Messiah whom they expected. The reason was that they were of such a character 
that it was foreseen that if such things had been disclosed to them they could not have helped profaning them, because they desired nothing but earthly things and because that race was of this 
nature and so remains, it is still permitted that they should be in utter unbelief; for if they had once acknowledged, and had afterwards gone back, they must needs have brought upon themselves the most 
grievous of all hells.  [4] This was also the reason why the Lord did not come into the world and reveal the internal things of the Word until there was no good whatever remaining with them, not even 
natural good, for they could then no longer receive any truth with internal acknowledgment (because it is good that receives truth), and therefore they could not profane it. Such was the state meant 
by the "fullness of time," and by the "consummation of the age," and also by the "last day" so much treated of in the Prophets. It is for the same reason that the arcana of the internal sense of the 
Word are now being revealed; for at this day there is scarcely any faith, because not any charity; thus because it is the consummation of the age and when this is the case, then these arcana can be 
revealed without danger of profanation, because they are not interiorly acknowledged.  [5] It is for this secret reason that it is related in the Word concerning Abraham and Isaac that when in Gerar 
with Abimelech they called their wives their sisters. (See further what has been stated and shown above on this subject; namely, That those can profane who acknowledge, but not those who do not acknowledge, 
still less those who do not know, n. 593, 1008, 1010, 1059: What danger there is from a profanation of holy things and of the Word, n. 571, 582: That they who are within the church can profane 
holy things; but not they who are without the church, n. 2051: That it is provided by the Lord that profanation may not take place, n. 1001, 2426: That worship becomes external in order to prevent internal 
worship from being profaned, n. 1327, 1328: That men are kept in ignorance, lest the truths of faith should be profaned, n. 301-303.) </p>

'One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us' means that it could have been adulterated and so profaned. This is clear from the meaning of 'lying wish' 
as being perverted or adulterated; from the meaning of 'one of the people' as one who belongs to the Church, that is to say, to the spiritual Church, dealt with in <a href="2928.htm">2928</a>; from the meaning of 'wife' 
- who is Rebekah here - as Divine Truth, dealt with above; and from the meaning of 'guilt' as blame for the profanation of truth. From this it is evident that 'one of the people might easily have lain 
with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us' means that Divine Truth could easily have been adulterated by someone within the Church and so he would have made himself culpable of the profanation 
of truth. It has been stated above in <a href="3386.htm">3386</a> that the reason why Abraham on two occasions spoke of Sarah his wife as his sister - first of all in Egypt, and then, when dwelling with Abimelech, 
in Gerar - and why Isaac in a similar way spoke of Rebekah his wife as his sister, when he too was dwelling with Abimelech, and why those three occasions are mentioned in the Word, is a very deep arcanum. 
The actual arcanum contained in these words is evident in the internal sense, and it is this: 'A sister' means rational truth, and 'a wife' Divine Truth; and rational truth is called this - that 
is, 'a sister' - to prevent Divine Truth, which is 'a wife' (Rebekah in this case) from being adulterated and so perverted. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 With regard to the profanation of truth the position is that Divine Truth 
cannot possibly be profaned except by those who have already acknowledged it. For these people have first of all, through acknowledgement and faith, come to the truth, and so have been introduced 
into it. If after this they depart from that truth there remains within them a permanent imprint of it, which is recalled together with falsity and evil whenever these are recalled. And being attached 
to falsity and evil that truth is consequently made profane. People therefore with whom this happens have within them permanently that which is condemning, and so the hell which is their own. Indeed 
when those in hell draw near a sphere where good and truth are present they instantly experience their own hell, for they run into that which they hate, and as a consequence into torment. People therefore 
who have profaned truth dwell permanently with that which torments them - the intensity of torment depending on the degree of profanation. This being so, the Lord makes the greatest provision to 
prevent Divine Good and Truth being made profane. He does so especially with anyone who is such that he cannot help profaning them, by keeping him as far back as possible from acknowledgement of and 
faith in truth and good. For as has been stated, no one is able to profane them except him who has already acknowledged and come to believe them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 This was the reason why internal truths were not 
disclosed to the descendants of Jacob - to the Israelites and Jews. Not even the existence of anything internal within man, nor thus any kind of internal worship was openly declared to them, and scarcely 
anything about life after death, or about the heavenly kingdom of the Lord or the Messiah whom they awaited. The reason why these truths were not declared was, as foreseen, that if they had been 
disclosed to them, the Jews and Israelites were such as could not help profaning them; for they had no desire for anything other than what was earthly. And because those descendants were such, and are 
so still, they are still allowed to remain without any belief at all in internal truths. For if at one point they had given their assent to them and then had withdrawn it they would inevitably have 
ended up in the worst hell of all. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 This was also the reason why the Lord did not come into the world and reveal the internal features of the Word until the time when no good at all, not even natural 
good, remained with them. For at that point they were no longer capable of receiving any truth and acknowledging it internally - for good is what receives - and so were no longer capable of profaning 
it. It is this state that is meant by the fulness of time, and by the close of the age, and also by the last day, spoken of many times in the Prophets. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 It is for the same reason also that 
at the present time the arcana belonging to the internal sense of the Word are being revealed, for today scarcely any faith exists because charity is non-existent, so that the close of the age is here. 
When these conditions prevail these arcana can be revealed without any risk of profanation since they are not acknowledged interiorly. It is for the sake of this arcanum that in the Word mention is 
made of Abraham and of Isaac, of how, when dwelling in Gerar with Abimelech, each called his wife his sister. See in addition what has been stated and shown already on the same subject, to the effect 
that those who acknowledge are able to profane, but not those who do not acknowledge, still less those who do not even know, <a href="593.htm">593</a>, <a href="1008.htm">1008</a>, <a href="1010.htm">1010</a>, <a href="1059.htm">1059</a>. How much danger lies in profaning sacred things and 
the Word, see <a href="571.htm">571</a>, <a href="582.htm">582</a>. People inside the Church are able to profane sacred things, but not those outside, <a href="2051.htm">2051</a>. The Lord provides against the occurrence of profanation, <a href="1001.htm">1001</a>, <a href="2426.htm">2426</a>. Worship may become 
external to prevent the profaning of internal worship, <a href="1327.htm">1327</a>, <a href="1328.htm">1328</a>. People are kept in ignorance to prevent the truths of faith being made profane, <a href="301.htm">301</a>-<a href="303.htm">303</a>. </p>

`Ut parum cubaret unus populi cum muliere tua, et adduxisses super nos reatum': quod significet quod adulterari potuisset et sic profanari, constat a significatione `cubare' quod sit perverti seu adulterari; 
a significatione `unius populi' quod sit aliquis ab Ecclesia, nempe spirituali, de qua n. 2928; a significatione `mulieris,' hic Rebeccae, quod sit Divinum Verum, de qua supra; et a significatione 
`reatus' quod sit culpa profanationis veri; inde patet quod `ut parum cubaret unus populi cum {1}uxore tua, et adduxisses super nos reatum' sit quod Divinum Verum ab aliquo in Ecclesia facile potuisset 
adulterari, et {2}culpam profanationis veri sibi inducere. Supra n. 3386 dictum, quod quia Abrahamus bis Saram uxorem suam dixerit sororem, primum in Aegypto, et dein in Gerar apud Abimelechum, 
et quod Jishakus similiter Rebeccam mulierem suam dixerit sororem etiam apud Abimelechum, et quia tria illa in Verbo quoque memorantur, quod arcanissimum quoddam sit, cur ita; {3}ipsum arcanum in his 
in sensu interno patet, nempe quia per `sororem' significatur rationale, et per `mulierem' Divinum Verum, et quod rationale dictam, hoc est, `soror,' ne Divinum Verum quod est `mulier,' hic Rebecca, 
adulteraretur et sic profanaretur. [2] Cum profanatione veri ita se habet quod Divinum Verum nequaquam possit profanari quam ab illis qui prius id agnoverunt, illi enim primum intrarunt per agnitionem 
et fidem in verum, et sic ei initiati sunt; cum dein recedunt ab illo, tunc continue manet vestigium ejus intus impressum, quod simul revocatur quando falsum et malum, inde verum quia illis adhaerescit, 
profanatur; ideo illi, apud quos hoc fit, in se continue habent quod damnat, ita sui infernum; infernales enim cum ad sphaeram ubi bonum et verum, approximant, ilico sentiunt suum infernum, nam 
veniunt in illud quod odio habent, consequenter in cruciatum; qui itaque profanarunt verum, habitant continue cum illo quod eos cruciat, et hoc secundum {4}gradum profanationis: quia ita est, summopere 
providetur a Domino ne Divinum Bonum et Verum profanetur; et providetur imprimis per id quod homo qui talis est ut non possit aliter quam profanare, detineatur tam procul ab agnitione et fide veri et 
boni quantum possit, nam, ut dictum, nemo profanare potest quam qui prius agnovit et credidit: [3] illa causa fuit quod posteris Jacobi, Israelitis et Judaeis, non detecta fuerint vera interna, ne quidem 
aperte dictum quod aliquid internum in homine esset, ita quod aliquis internus cultus sit, et vix aliquid de vita post mortem, et de regno caelesti Domini, seu Messiae quem exspectarunt; causa fuit 
quia tales erant quod praevisum, quod si illis detecta fuissent, non potuissent aliter quam illa profanavisse, non enim aliud voluerunt quam terrestria; et quia generatio illa talis fuit, et quoque 
talis est, permittitur etiam adhuc ut sint prorsus in incredulitate; si enim semel agnovissent, et dein recessissent {5}, tunc non potuissent aliter quam {6}inducere sibi omnium gravissimum infernum. 
[4] Illa quoque causa fuit quod Dominus non prius in mundum venerit, et interna Verbi revelaverit, quam cum prorsus nullum bonum, ne quidem bonum naturale, apud illos residuum {7}esset, tunc enim amplius 
non recipere potuerunt aliquod verum usque ad agnitionem internam, nam bonum est quod recipit, ita non profanare; {8}talis status erat qui intelligitur per plenitudinem temporum {9}, et per consummationem 
saeculi, etiam per ultimum diem, de quo (t)multis apud Prophetas: eadem etiam causa est quod nunc revelentur arcana sensus interni Verbi, quia hodie vix aliqua fides est, quia non aliqua charitas, 
ita quia consummatio saeculi est; [5] et cum haec, tunc revelari possunt {10}absque periculo profanationis, quia non interius agnoscuntur. Propter hoc arcanum est quod in Verbo memoretur de Abrahamo 
et de Jishako quod uxores suas in Gerare apud Abimelechum vocaverint sorores. Videantur porro illa quae prius de eadem re dicta et ostensa sunt, nempe quod profanare possint qui agnoscunt, non 
autem qui non agnoscunt, minus qui non sciunt, n. 593, 1008, 1010, 1059: quid periculi a profanatione sanctorum et Verbi, n. 571, 582: quod qui intra Ecclesiam sunt, profanare possint sancta, non autem 
qui extra, n. 2051: quod provideatur a Domino ne profanatio fiat, n. 1001, 2426: quod cultus fiat externus ne profanetur internus, n. 1327, 1328: quod teneantur in ignorantia, ne profanentur vera fidei, 
n. 301-303. @1 muliere$  @2 i sic$  @3 A has ipsum arcanum quodnam sit, ex his in sensu interno patet, nempe quia per sororem significatur rationale, et per mulierem Divinum Verum, et quod soror 
dicta ne Divinum Verum, quod repraesentatur per Rebeccam, adulteraretur, et sic prophanaretur. Cum prophanatione veri ita se habet, quod Divinum Verum nequaquam possit prophanari, quam ab illis 
qui prius id agnoscunt, illi enim primum intrarunt per agnitionem et fidem in verum ac sic ei initiati sunt, cum dein recedunt ab illo, tunc continue manet vestigium ejus intus impressum, quod simul 
revocatur, cum falso et malo, inde quia adhaerescit verum falso et malo, nec separari potest, prophanatur, et etiam apud quos hoc fit in se continue habet illud quod damnat, proinde infernum infernales
