<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10517节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10517</strong>.此外，他们是诚实善良的人，以至于可称作美德的典范；他们忍受着施加给他们的伤害，却丝毫没有报复的感觉。他们一遇到那些思想肉体和尘世事物的人就感到不安；一靠近那些思想天上事物的人就感到欢喜、快乐。我也明显发觉他们所感到的不安，是由我周围的地球灵在场引起的，因为他们具有相反的性情。我们地球灵很少思想天上的事物，却大量思想肉体和尘世的事物。当思想天上的事物时，他们把注意力集中在真理上，却不集中在良善上；而来自这个星球的灵人却集中思想良善，很少思想真理。这解释了为何这个星球的居民喜欢树木种植园和用这些树所建的圣殿；厌恶石块和用它们所建的房屋。因为树木和木头因其对应关系而表示良善，而石头和用它们所建的房屋则表示真理（<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>节）。人都有这样的性情，他喜欢与他内心情感相对应的事物，尽管他活在世上时没有意识到这一点。</p>

Besides all this they are upright, insomuch that they may be called probities. They bear the injuries done them without any revengeful feeling. They become anxious as soon as they approach those who 
think about bodily and earthly things, but glad and cheerful on approaching those who think about heavenly things. The anxiety excited in them by the spirits of our earth who were about me, on account 
of these being of a contrary nature, was plainly perceived. For the spirits of our earth think little about heavenly things, and much about bodily and earthly things; and when they think about heavenly 
things, they think about truths, and not about good; whereas the spirits from that earth think about good, and but little about truths. From this it is that the inhabitants of that earth love plantations 
of trees, and their sacred edifice made of trees; and that they hold in aversion works of stone and houses of stone; for trees and wood from the correspondence signify goods, whereas stones and 
houses built of stone signify truths (n. 3720). Moreover, man is such that he loves those things which correspond to his interior affections, although during his life in the world he does not know this. </p>

Furthermore they are honest and virtuous people, so that they may be called paragons of virtue; they endure the wrongs that are done to them without any thought of getting their own back. They feel uneasy 
as soon as they encounter those whose thoughts are focused on bodily and earthly things, and cheerful and glad when they encounter those whose thoughts are focused on heavenly ones. I became aware 
also of the uneasiness they felt, caused by the presence of the spirits belonging to our planet who were around me, because they were of a contrary disposition. For spirits belonging to our planet 
give little thought to heavenly things and much thought to bodily and earthly ones. And when they do give thought to heavenly things, they focus their attention on truths and not on good, whereas spirits 
from that planet out in space focus on good and little on truths. This explains why the inhabitants of that planet love plantations of trees and their temple consisting of them, and loathe blocks 
of stone and houses made from them. For trees and wood by virtue of their correspondence mean forms of good, but stones and houses made from them mean truths, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>. Also a person is by disposition such 
that he loves objects which correspond to his inner affections, though he is not conscious of this while he lives in the world.  </p>

</p><b>10517.</b>
Praeterea probi sunt, ut dici queant probitates; patiuntur injurias, quae sibi inferuntur, absque animo vindicandi.  Anxii fiunt ut primum veniunt ad illos qui de corporeis et terrestribus cogitant, 
ac laeti et hilares cum ad illos qui de caelestibus; percepta etiam est anxietas illorum ex spiritibus nostrae telluris qui circum me erant, quia ex indole contraria; nostrae enim telluris spiritus parum 
cogitant de caelestibus, et multum de corporeis et terrestribus; et cum de caelestibus, de veris cogitant et non de bono; spiritus autem ex illa tellure de bono cogitant, et parum de veris.  Inde 
est quod incolae illius telluris ament arboreta, ac aedem suam ex illis, et aversentur lapidea et domos ex illis; arbores enim et ligna ex correspondentia significant bona, at lapides et domus ex illis 
significant vera, n. 3720; homo etiam talis est ut amet illa quae affectionibus ejus interioribus correspondent, (x)tametsi cum in mundo vivit, id nescit. </p>
