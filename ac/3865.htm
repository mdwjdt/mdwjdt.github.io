<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3865节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3865.</strong>“如今我的男人必爱我”表真理的良善就出自该状态。这从“爱”和“男人”的含义清楚可知，爱是指出自该状态的良善，因为一切良善都是爱的产物，因而在此由“爱”来表示；“男人”是指真理（<a href="3134.htm">3134</a>节）。至于何为真理的良善，这在前面已反复解释过了，即：它是为了生活而对真理的情感；因为生活就是在真理里面被那些后来重生的人所看到的良善。没有照着真理的生活，真理与良善就不会联结起来，因而良善就无法变成人自己的。<br />只要注意一下那些过着邪恶生活的人和那些过着良善生活的人，谁都能非常清楚地看出这一点。检查一下那些过着邪恶生活的人就会发现，他们尽管在童年和青少年时期在教会的教义上接受过教导，却根本不相信关于主的任何事，也不信祂和教会的真理；而那些过着良善生活的人，则人人都信他们视为真理的那些真理。然而，那些像教会领袖那样教导真理，然而却过着邪恶生活的人的确声称他们相信，其实他们发自内心不信。<br />其中有些人具有一种说服之信，这种信是正信的仿品，只不过是所确认的纯记忆知识。他们确认这种知识不是因为它是真理，乃因声称忠于它会提升他们的地位、荣耀和利益。这种知识也就从耳朵进入记忆，再从记忆传到嘴上，而不会进入内心，并由此进入对它的承认。由此明显可知，只有生活才能表明对真理的这种承认的性质，也就是信的性质。他们还表明，脱离生活良善的信声称，一个人无论生活如何，都能凭恩典得救；并且这种信还反对这一教导：每个人的生命死后仍旧存留。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3865</b></p><p><b>3865.</b>
For now my man will love me. That this signifies that hence would come the good of truth, is evident from the signification of "will love," as being the good therefrom; for all good is of love, and is 
therefore here signified by "loving;" and from the signification of "man," as being truth (n. 3134). What the good of truth is, has often been explained above, namely, that it is the affection of truth 
for the sake of life; for life is the good which is regarded in the truth by those who are afterwards regenerated. Without a life according to truth, no conjunction of truth with good is effected, 
consequently no appropriation. [2] Everyone can plainly see this by directing his attention to those who live ill, and to those who live well: they who live ill, even although like others they have 
been instructed during childhood and youth in the doctrines of the church, are nevertheless found on examination to believe nothing at all concerning the Lord, or concerning faith in Him and the truths 
of the church; whereas they who live well have everyone of them faith in the truths which they believe to be truths. They, however, who teach truths, as do the overseers of the church, and live ill, 
may indeed profess to believe, yet still at heart they do not believe. [3] With some of these there is a persuasion which has the semblance of faith, amounting to no more than mere memory-knowledge 
confirmed, not because it is truth, but because it is expedient to make profession of it for the sake of one's office, honor, and gain. This penetrates no deeper than through the ears into the memory, 
and from the memory it goes forth into the lips, but not into the heart, and from this into confession. From this it is evident that it is the life which shows the quality of the acknowledgment of truth; 
that is, the quality of the faith; and that it is faith separated from the good of life which declares that however a man lives he may nevertheless be saved through grace; and which argues against 
the doctrine that everyone's life remains with him after death. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3865</b></p><p><b>3865.</b>
'For now my husband will love me' means that from this state would come the good of truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'will love' as the good coming from this state, for all good is the product 
of love and is therefore the meaning of 'love' at this point; and from the meaning of 'husband' (vir) as truth, dealt with in <a href="3134.htm">3134</a>. What the good of truth is has been explained frequently already, namely 
an affection for truth for the sake of life, for life is the good seen within truth by those who are subsequently regenerated. Without life in accordance with truth no truth can ever become joined 
to good nor consequently can good be made one's own. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This can be seen quite clearly by anyone if he turns his attention to those who lead evil lives and to those who lead good lives. Those who 
lead evil lives, though instructed in the teachings of the Church during childhood and youth like everybody else, will be found on examination to believe nothing at all about the Lord, about faith 
in Him, or about the truths of the Church, whereas those who lead good lives will be found in every case to have faith in those truths which they believe to be truths. Those however who teach truths, 
as Church leaders do, and yet lead evil lives will indeed say that they believe, yet they do not believe in their hearts. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 With some a persuasive faith exists which is an imitation of true faith, 
but that faith is no more than factual knowledge which has been corroborated by them not because it is the truth but because by declaring their allegiance to it they improve their chances of personal 
position, honour, and gain. That knowledge goes no further than through the ears into the memory, and from the memory passes out on to the lips. It does not enter the heart and from there into a confession 
of it. From these considerations it is evident that the life is the guide to what kind of acknowledgement of truth exists, that is, to what kind of faith. They also show that faith separated from 
the good of life declares that no matter how a person lives he can still be saved by grace, and that such faith argues against the teaching that everyone's life remains with him after death. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 3865</b>
</p><b>3865.</b>
`Quia nunc amabit me vir meus': quod significet quod inde bonum veri, constat a significatione `amabit' quod sit inde bonum, omne enim bonum est amoris, quare id per amare hic significatur; et ex 
significatione `viri' quod sit verum, de qua n. 3134.  Quid bonum veri, prius aliquoties explicatum est, quod nempe sit affectio veri {1} propter vitam, nam vita est bonum quod spectatur in vero ab 
illis qui postea regenerantur; absque vita secundum verum {2} nulla fit conjunctio veri cum bono, proinde nulla appropriatio: hoc evidenter constare potest unicuivis, si attendat ad illos qui male 
vivunt et ad illos qui bene vivunt, quod nempe qui male vivunt, tametsi in pueritia et in juventute doctrinalia Ecclesiae aeque ac alii calluerint, usque si explorentur quid credant de Domino, de 
fide in Ipsum, et de veris Ecclesiae, comperies quod ne hilum credant; at qui bene vivunt, quod quisque eorum fidem veris quae credunt vera esse, habeant: qui autem docent vera, ut antistites Ecclesiae, 
et male vivunt, quidem  se dicent credere, sed usque corde non credunt; apud quosdam est persuasivum quod mentitur fidem, sed persuasivum est tale quod sit scientificum confirmatum non propter 
quod verum sit, sed propter quod id profitendum sui officii, honoris et lucri causa; hoc non altius vadit quam per aures in memoriam, et a memoria exit in labia, non autem in cor et inde in confessionem. 
 Inde patet quod vita doceat qualis agnitio veri sit, hoc est, qualis fides; et quod fides separata a bono vitae dicat quod utcumque homo vivit, usque ex gratia salvari possit; et quod ratiocinetur 
contra illud doctrinae quod unumquemvis vita ejus maneat post mortem. @1 ejus$ @2 vitae bono$ </p>
