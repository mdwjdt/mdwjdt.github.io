<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2045节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2045.</strong>“都要受割礼”表洁净。这从“割礼”的代表和含义清楚可知，“割礼”是指从污秽的爱中洁净，如前面所解释的（<a href="2039.htm">2039</a>节）。沉浸于我欲和物欲中的人根本不相信他们身处如此污秽和不洁的事物中，事实上，他们的确身处其中。因为有某种愉悦和快乐会哄骗、支持、诱惑、促使他们去爱那种生活，去偏爱它过于偏爱所有其它生活，从而使他们以为它里面根本没有任何邪恶之物，因为凡支持人的爱及由此而来的生活之物都被视为良善。为此，理性也同意并制造确认的虚假，而这虚假所导致的盲目如此巨大，以致他们根本看不见有关天堂之爱性质的任何事物。即使看见，他们也会发自内心说，这是悲惨的事，或毫无价值的事，或某种具有幻觉性质的事；而这种幻觉会占据头脑，如同头脑患病一样。<br />但我欲和物欲的生活，连同它的愉悦和快乐是污秽和不洁的。若人愿意通过早已赋予他的理性能力思考，谁都能看出这一点。我欲是摧毁文明社会的一切罪恶的源头。一切仇恨、一切报复、一切残忍，甚至一切淫乱皆从我欲，如同从一个污坑涌出。凡爱自己的人都会鄙视、辱骂和仇恨不服侍、尊重或支持他的所有人。他在仇恨中只会照着爱自己的程度呼出报复和残忍。由于这些原因，这爱对社会和人类都具有毁灭性。这就是它的性质，对此，可参看第一卷有关该主题的论述（<a href="693.htm">693</a>，<a href="694.htm">694</a>，<a href="760.htm">760</a>，<a href="1307.htm">1307</a>，<a href="1308.htm">1308</a>，<a href="1321.htm">1321</a>，<a href="1506.htm">1506</a>，<a href="1594.htm">1594</a>，<a href="1691.htm">1691</a>，<a href="1862.htm">1862</a>节） 。在来世，我欲是最污秽的，它与构成天堂的相爱截然对立。对此，蒙主怜悯，容后再述。<br />由于我欲是仇恨、报复、残忍和淫乱的源头，故它也是被称为罪孽、罪行、可憎和亵渎的一切事物的源头。因此，当我欲存在于人类理性，并存在于外在人的欲望和幻觉中时，从主而来的天堂之爱的流注就不断被排斥、滥用或玷污。它就像恶臭的排泄物，驱散、甚至污染一切甜味；还像不断将所流入的光线转变为阴暗、丑恶色彩的物体；又像老虎或毒蛇，排斥一切爱抚，咬杀或毒杀给它提供食物的人；或像恶毒的人，他甚至将别人的好意和纯粹的善行转变为应受谴责和邪恶的东西。由此明显可知，这些爱（即我欲和物欲）就是那要被割去的包皮所代表和表示的。</p>

Shall be circumcised unto you. That this signifies purification, is evident from the representation and signification of "circumcision," as being purification from filthy loves (explained above, n. 2039). 
They who are in the loves of self and of the world cannot possibly believe that they are in things so filthy and unclean as they actually are in, for there is a certain pleasure and delight that 
soothes, favors, and allures, and causes them to love that life, to prefer it to all other life, and thereby to suppose that there is nothing of evil in it; for whatever favors anyone's love and the 
life thence derived is believed to be good. Hence also the rational consents, and suggests falsities which confirm and cause such blindness that they see nothing of the nature of heavenly love; and if 
they were to see it they would say in their hearts that it is a wretched affair, or a thing of naught, or something of the nature of a phantasy that takes hold of the mind, as in sickness.  [2] But 
that the life of the love of self and of the world, together with its pleasures and delights, is filthy and unclean, may be seen by everyone who is willing to think from the rational faculty with which 
he is gifted. The love of self is the source of all the evils that destroy civic society. From it as from an unclean pit spring all hatreds, all revenges, all cruelties, nay, all adulteries; for he 
who loves himself, despises, vituperates, or hates, all others who do not serve him, or do him honor, or favor him; and when he hates, he breathes nothing but revenges and cruelties, and this in proportion 
to the degree in which he loves himself, so that this love is destructive of society and of the human race. (That such is its nature may be seen also from what is said of it in Part First, n. 693, 
694, 760, 1307, 1308, 1321, 1506, 1594, 1691, 1862.) That in the other life the love of self is most filthy, and that it is diametrically opposite to the mutual love in which heaven consists, shall 
of the Lord's Divine mercy be told in what follows.  [3] And as the love of self is the source of hatreds, revenges, cruelties, and adulteries, it is the source of all things that are called sins, wickednesses, 
abominations, and profanations, and therefore when this love is in the rational part of man, and is in the cupidities and phantasies of his external man, the influx of heavenly love from 
the Lord is continually repelled, perverted, and contaminated. It is like foul excrement, which dissipates, nay, defiles, all sweet odor; it is like an object that turns the continually inflowing rays 
of light into dark and repulsive colors; and it is like a tiger, or a serpent, which repels all fondling, and kills with bite and poison those who offer it food; or like a vicious man who turns even 
the best intentions of others, and their very kindnesses, into what is blameworthy and malicious. Hence it is evident that these loves-of self and of the world-are what are represented and signified by 
the foreskins that were to be cut off. </p>

'Shall be circumcised among you' means purification. This is clear from the representation and meaning of 'circumcision' as purification from filthy loves, dealt with above in <a href="2039.htm">2039</a>. People who are immersed 
in self-love and love of the world are quite incapable of believing that they are under the influence of such filthy and unclean loves as in fact they are. Indeed a certain pleasure and delight 
exists which coaxes, encourages, and allures, and causes them to love that life, to prefer it to every other kind of life, and so to imagine that there is nothing bad about it at all. For whatever encourages 
anyone's love and resulting life is considered to be good. For this reason also the rational agrees to and produces confirmatory falsities which lead to blindness so great that people see nothing 
at all of what heavenly love is. And if they did see it they would in their hearts say that it was something wretched, or not really anything at all, or something in the nature of a delusion which 
takes possession of the mind as it does in sickness. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That the life which belongs to self-love and love of the world, together with its pleasures and delights, is filthy and unclean may become 
clear to anyone if he is willing to think from the powers of reason which have been given to him. Self-love is the source of all the evils that destroy civilized society. From it, as from a filthy pit, 
all forms of hatred, revenge, and cruelty stream forth, and indeed of adultery. For anyone who loves himself either holds in contempt or reviles or hates everybody else who does not serve him or who 
does not further his interests or who fails to show him favour; and in hating he breathes nothing but revenge and cruelty - doing so in the measure that he loves himself. Such love is for these reasons 
destructive of society and of the human race. That this is its nature, see also what has been stated in Volume One on the same subject, in <a href="693.htm">693</a>, <a href="694.htm">694</a>, <a href="760.htm">760</a>, <a href="1307.htm">1307</a>, <a href="1308.htm">1308</a>, <a href="1321.htm">1321</a>, <a href="1506.htm">1506</a>, <a href="1594.htm">1594</a>, <a href="1691.htm">1691</a>, <a href="1862.htm">1862</a>. 
That self-love is in the next life utterly filthy and diametrically opposed to the mutual love that constitutes heaven will in the Lord's Divine mercy be discussed later on. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 And since that love 
is the source of all hatred, revenge, cruelty, and adultery, it is the source of all things that are called sins, crimes, abominations, and profanations. When therefore self-love is present in a person's 
rational, and in the desires and delusions of his external man, the influx of heavenly love from the Lord in that case is constantly intercepted, degraded, and defiled. It is like foul excrement 
which dispels, indeed pollutes, every pleasant odor. It also resembles an object which is constantly converting inflowing rays of light into dark and hideous colours. Or it is like a tiger or a serpent 
that hisses when fondled and kills with its bite or poison those who feed it. Or else it is like a villain who converts even the best intentions of other people, and sheer acts of kindness, into what 
is reprehensible and wicked. From this it is clear that those loves - self-love and love of the world - are what were represented and meant by the foreskins that were to be cut off. </p>

`Circumcidetur vobis': quod significet purificationem constat a repraesentatione et significatione `circumcisionis' quod sit purificatio ab amoribus spurcis, de qua supra n. 2039.  Qui in amoribus sui 
et mundi sunt, nusquam credere possunt quod in tam spurcis et immundis sint, sicut actualiter sunt: quoddam enim volupe et jucundum est quod mulcet, favet, et adblanditur, et facit ut vitam eam ament: 
praeferant omni alii vitae, et sic putent nihil mali inesse; nam quicquid favet alicujus amori et inde vitae, creditur esse bonum; inde etiam rationale consentit et suggerit falsa quae confirmat, 
quae occaecant in tantum ut nihil {1} videant quid amor caelestis, et si viderent, corde suo dicerent esse quoddam miserum, aut (o)quoddam nihil, aut quoddam phantasiae simile, quod animum tenet sicut 
in aegritudine: [2] sed quod vita amoris sui et mundi cum ejus voluptariis et jucundis sit spurca et immunda, constare potest cuivis {2} si ex rationali facultate qua donatus est, cogitare velit; amor 
sui est ex quo omnia mala quae destruunt societatem civilem; ex illo ut ex immundo puteo scaturiunt omnia odia, omnes vindictae, omnes crudelitates, immo omnia adulteria; qui enim se amat, alios omnes 
qui sibi non serviunt aut honorem praestant aut favent, vel contemnit vel vituperat vel odio habet, et cum odio habet, non spirat nisi vindictas et crudelitates, et hoc quantum se amat; ita amor ille 
est destructivus societatis et generis humani; quod talis sit, videantur etiam quae in Parte Prima de eodem dicta sunt n. 693, 694, 760, 1307, 1308, 1321, 1506, 1594, 1691, 1862: quod amor sui sit 
spurcissimus in altera vita, et e diametro oppositus amori mutuo in quo caelum consistit, in sequentibus etiam, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, dicetur; [3] et quia inde sunt odia, vindictae, crudelitate: 
et adulteria, inde sunt omnia quae peccata, scelera, abominationes, et profanationes vocantur; quare cum ille in rationali hominis est, inque ejus externi hominis cupiditatibus et phantasiis, tunc 
influxus amori, caelestis a Domino continuo arcetur, pervertitur et contaminatur; est sicut foedum excrementum {3}, quod omnem odorem suavem dissipat: immo conspurcat; et est sicut objectum quod radios 
lucis continue influentes in tetros et nigros colores vertit; et est sicut tigris et serpens qui adblandimenta respuit, et eos qui cibos porrigunt, morsu et veneno necat; aut sicut homo facinorosus 
qui intentiones etiam optimas aliorum, ipsaque beneficia in vituperia et malitias vertit: inde constat quod amores illi, nempe sui et mundi, sint qui per praeputia repraesentantur et significantur quae 
abscindenda. 	@1 nihilum.$ 	@2 qui.$ 	@3 excrementitium.$ </p>
