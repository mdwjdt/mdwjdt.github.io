<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10497节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10497</strong>.“到了第二天”表这种敬拜一直持续到教会结束的时间。这从“第二天”的含义清楚可知。“第二天”是指持续、永恒之物；但当论及犹太民族时，是指一直持续到教会结束之物。“第二天”之所以表示持续、永恒之物，是因为“明天”当论及诸如表示神性属天和属灵的真实事物的那类事物时，表示持续、永恒之物（<a href="3998.htm">3998</a>，<a href="9939.htm">9939</a>节）。然而，此处之所以表示一直持续到教会结束的时间，是因为这个词论及犹太民族及其敬拜，当主降世时，这种敬拜就结束了，正如但以理书所预言的：<br />为你的人民和你的圣城，已经定了七十个七，要结束罪过，封住罪恶，赎尽罪孽，引进永义，封住异象和预言，并膏至圣者。一七中间，他必使祭祀与供献止息。最终必有荒凉临到那可憎的鸟；直到所定的结局倾在那荒凉者身上为止。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但9.24.htm">9:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但9.27.htm">27</a>）<br />主在马太福音中预言，当欧洲的当今教会结束之时，这个民族的敬拜的残余将会结束：<br />我实在告诉你们，这世代还没有过去，这些事都要成就。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.34.htm">24:34</a>）<br />这一章论述的主题是时代的完结，也就是这个教会的结束，正如创世记26-40章的开头部分所说明和看到的。</p>

And it came to pass on the day after. That this signifies the duration of such worship even to the end of the church, is evident from the signification of "on the day after," as being what is perpetual 
and eternal, but when said concerning the Jewish nation as being even to the end of the church. The reason why "the day after" denotes what is perpetual and eternal, is that by "the morrow," when said 
of such things as signify Divine, celestial, and spiritual things, is signified what is perpetual and eternal (n. 3998, 9939); but the reason why it denotes duration even to the end of the church, 
is that it is said of the Jewish nation and its worship, which worship came to an end when the Lord came into the world, according to the prediction in Daniel: </p>
<p>     Seventy weeks have been decreed upon 
thy people and upon thy city of holiness, to consummate the transgression, and to seal up sins, and to expiate iniquity, and to bring in the righteousness of the ages, and to seal up vision and prophet, 
and to anoint the holy of holies. In the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease; finally upon the bird of abominations shall be desolation; and even with the consummation 
and the decree, it shall drop upon the devastation (Dan. 9:24, 27).      And that the residue of the worship of that nation will come to an end together with the end of the present church 
in Europe, is foretold by the Lord in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Verily I say unto you, this generation shall not pass away until all these things come to pass (Matt. 24:34); </p>
<p>the subject treated of in this chapter 
is the consummation of the age, which is the end of this church, as can be seen shown in the introductions to Genesis, chapters 26 to 40. </p>

'And it happened on the next day' means the duration of such worship right to the end of the Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'the next day' as that which is perpetual and eternal; but when 
the Jewish nation is the subject that which continues right to the end of the Church is meant. The reason why the expression 'the next day' means that which continues perpetually and into eternity is 
that when 'the morrow' is mentioned in connection with such things as serve to mean Divine celestial and spiritual realities it means that which is perpetual and eternal, see <a href="3998.htm">3998</a>, <a href="9939.htm">9939</a>. Here however 
the duration right to the end of the Church is meant because that expression has reference to the Jewish nation and its worship, which had an end when the Lord came into the world, as foretold in Daniel, 
 </p>
<blockquote>
Seventy weeks have been decreed concerning your people and your holy city to bring transgression to a close and to seal up sins and to atone for iniquity, and to bring everlasting righteousness, 
and to seal up vision and prophet, and to anoint the Holy of Holies. In the middle of the week he will cause sacrifice and offering to cease. At length upon the bird of abominations will come desolation; 
until the close and the decree will it drop upon the devastation. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%209:24,27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 9:24,27</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And the fact that what still remains of the worship of that nation will have an end at the end of the present-day 
Church in Europe is foretold by the Lord in Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2024:34&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 24:34</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>That chapter deals with the close 
of the age, which is the end of this Church, as has been shown and may be seen in the preliminary sections to Genesis <a href="26.htm">26</a>-<a href="40.htm">40</a>.  </p>

`Et factum postridie': quod significet durationem cultus talis usque ad finem Ecclesiae, constat ex significatione `postridie' quod sit perpetuum et aeternum, at cum de gente Judaica, quod sit usque 
ad finem Ecclesiae; quod `postridie' sit in perpetuum et in aeternum, est quia per `crastinum' cum id dicitur de talibus quae significant {1} Divina (o)caelestia et spiritualia, perpetuum ac aeternum 
{2} significatur, videatur n. 3998, 9939; quod autem sit duratio usque ad finem Ecclesiae: est quia dicitur de gente {3} Judaica et ejus cultu, qui finem habuit cum Dominus in mundum venit, secundum 
praedictionem apud Danielem,      	Septimanae septuaginta decisae sunt super populum tuum, et super urbem sanctitatis tuam, ad consumendum praevaricationem, et ad obsignandum peccata, et ad expiandum 
iniquitatem, et ad adducendum justitiam saeculorum, et ad obsignandum visionem et prophetam, et ad ungendum sanctum sanctorum; in medio septimanae cessare faciet sacrificium et oblationem; tandem super 
avem abominationum desolatio, et usque ad consummationem et decisum, stillabit super devastationem, ix 24, 27: </p>
<p>et quod residuum cultus illius gentis finem habiturum sit fine Ecclesiae hodiernae in 
Europa, praedicit Dominus apud Matthaeum {4},      	Amen dico vobis, Non praeteribit generatio haec, donec omnia haec fiunt, xxiv 34; </p>
