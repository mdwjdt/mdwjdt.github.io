<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6667节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6667.</strong>“严严地”表没有任何怜悯。这是显而易见的，无需解释；事实上，刚才（<a href="6666.htm">6666</a>节）所说的那些人没有怜悯，因为他们没有对邻之爱，只有自我之爱。看似存在于他们中间的对邻之爱无非是自我之爱。因为只要别人偏向他们，也就是说，站在他们那一边，他们就会爱他；但是，只要他不偏向他们，或不站在他们那一边，他们就会弃绝他；即便他以前曾是他们的朋友，他们仍仇恨他。像这样的态度就隐藏在自我之爱中，尽管它们没有在世上，而在来世表现出来；在来世，它们会公然爆发出来。它们之所以在那里爆发出来，是因为在那里，外在被拿走；当它们被拿走时，就能看见一个人内在是什么样子。</p>

With cruelty. That this signifies unmercifulness can be seen without explication; for they who have just been treated of have no mercy, because they have no love of the neighbor, but only the love of 
self. The love of the neighbor which appears with them is nothing but the love of self; for insofar as another favors them, that is, so far as he is theirs, so far he is loved; but insofar as he does 
not favor them, or insofar as he is not theirs, so far he is rejected; and if he had previously been a friend, so far he is hated. Such things lie hidden in the love of self, nor do they show themselves 
in the world, but in the other life, where they burst forth. The reason why they there burst forth is that externals are there taken away, and then it appears what the man has been inwardly. </p>

'With rigour' means without showing any mercy. This becomes clear without explanation, for those spoken of immediately above in <a href="6666.htm">6666</a> have no mercy because they have no love of the neighbour, only self-love. 
Love of the neighbour which seems to be present among them is nothing else than self-love. For as long as another is favourably disposed towards them, that is, is on their side, they love him; 
but as long as he is not favourably disposed towards them or not on their side they reject him, and if previously their friend they hate him. Attitudes such as this lie concealed in self-love, though 
they do not reveal themselves in the world, only in the next life, where they burst out into the open. The reason why they burst out there is that there outward appearances are taken away; and when they 
are taken away, one sees what a person has been like inwardly. </p>

</p><b>6667.</b>
`In saevitia': quod significet immisericordiam, constare potest absque explicatione; nam illis, de quibus mox supra n. 6666, nulla misericordia est quia nullus amor proximi, sed solum amor sui; amor 
proximi qui apud illos apparet nec aliud est quam amor sui, nam quantum alter favet, hoc est, quantum is suus est, tantum amatur; at quantum non favet, seu quantum non suus est, tantum rejicitur, et 
si prius fuerat amicus, tantum odio habetur, {7}talia latent' i amore sui; nec se {8}manifestant in mundo, sed in altera vita, ubi {8}erumpunt; causa quod ibi {8}erumpant, est quia externa ibi auferuntur; 
et tunc patet qualis homo interius fuerat. 	@1 hoc odium latet$ 	@2 Singular verbs$ </p>
