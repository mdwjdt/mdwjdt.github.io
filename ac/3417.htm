<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3417节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3417.</strong>“在基拉耳谷扎营，住在那里”表主回到低级的理性事物，也就是舍弃内层表象，转向外层表象。这从“扎营”、“基拉耳谷”和“住”的含义清楚可知：“扎营”是指排列成序；“基拉耳谷”是指低级的理性事物，或真理的外层表象，因为“谷”表低级，或也可说外层事物（<a href="1723.htm">1723</a>节），而“基拉耳”表信的事物，因而表真理的事物（<a href="1209.htm">1209</a>，<a href="2504.htm">2504</a>，<a href="3365.htm">3365</a>，<a href="3384.htm">3384</a>，<a href="3385.htm">3385</a>节）；“住”是指存在和生活（<a href="3384.htm">3384</a>节）。由此明显可知，他“在基拉耳谷扎营，住在那里”表示主将真理排列成序，以使它们能适合那些不怎么关注生活，却关注信的教义事物之人的理解和性情。这一点从圣言可以看出来，在圣言中，真理同样适合人们的理解力。<br />例如：关注教义事物，却不怎么关注生活的人只知道天国类似世上的国，因为人们因统治其他人而变得伟大。由此而来的快乐是他们所知道的唯一快乐，比起其它一切快乐，他们更热衷于这种快乐。因此，主在圣言中照着这表象说话，如马太福音：<br />凡遵行这诫命，又教训人的，他在天国要称为大的。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.19.htm">5:19</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />我曾说，你们是神，都是至高者的儿子。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗82.6.htm">82:6</a>；约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.34.htm">10:34</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.35.htm">35</a>）<br />一开始，甚至连门徒自己对天国也没有其它概念，只知道伟大、地位高于别人，和世上一样。这一点明显可见于马太福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太18.1.htm">18:1</a>）、马可福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/可9.34.htm">9:34</a>）、路加福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.46.htm">9:46</a>），他们还以为自己会坐在王的右手边和左手边（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.20.htm">20:20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.21.htm">21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.24.htm">24</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.37.htm">10:37</a>）。因此，当他们争论他们当中谁为大时，主也就照他们的理解和心里所想的回答说：<br />叫你们在我国里，坐在我的席上吃喝，并且坐在宝座上，审判以色列十二个支派。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.30.htm">22:30</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太19.28.htm">19:28</a>）<br />因为当时他们不知道天堂之乐不是伟大、地位高于别人的快乐，而是谦卑和对服侍他人的情感的快乐，因而这快乐在于渴望成为最小的，而不是最大的，如主在路加福音中所教导的：<br />你们中间最小的，他便为大。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.48.htm">9:48</a>）<br />因此，拥有认知的记忆知识，却没有仁爱生活的人，除了地位高于别人所产生的快乐外，不可能知道还有其它快乐的存在。由于唯有这种快乐占据他们的心思，构成其全部生命，故他们完全不知道由谦卑和对服侍别人的情感所产生的天堂快乐。也就是说，他们不知道对主之爱和对邻之仁，以及随之而来的祝福和幸福的快乐。这就是为何主调整祂的话，以适应他们不完美的见解，由此唤醒他们，把他们引入良善，从而学习、教导并行出良善。同时，祂也教导在天堂什么叫伟大和有地位（如马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太19.30.htm">19:30</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.16.htm">20:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.25.htm">25</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.28.htm">28</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.31.htm">10:31</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.42.htm">42</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.45.htm">45</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.48.htm">9:48</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.30.htm">13:30</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.25.htm">22:25</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.28.htm">28</a>）。这些，以及类似观念都是低级的真理表象，因为与其他人相比，天堂里的人的确被尊为大，有地位，对别人有权柄和权威，单单一个天使就比上万个地狱灵更有权柄，然而，却不是凭自己，而是凭主。他照着对他凭自己没有任何权柄，因而他是最小者的相信程度而通过主拥有权柄。并且他照着存在于他里面的谦卑和对服侍别人的情感的程度，也就是照着对主之爱和对邻之仁的良善存在于他里面的程度而能够拥有这样的信仰。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3417</b></p><p><b>3417.</b>
And encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. That this signifies that He betook Himself to lower rational things, that is, from interior appearances to exterior, is evident from the signification 
of "encamping," as being to dispose into order; and from the signification of the "valley of Gerar," as being lower rational things, or exterior appearances of truth, for a "valley" signifies lower, 
or what is the same, exterior things (n. 1723), and "Gerar" those which are of faith, thus which are of truth (n. 1209, 2504, 3365, 3384, 3385); and from the signification of "dwelling" as being 
to be and to live (n. 3384); so that by his "encamping in the valley of Gerar and dwelling there" is signified that the Lord so disposed truths that they might be adapted to the                     comprehension 
and genius of those also who are not much in life, but in the doctrinal things of faith; as may be seen from the Word, where also truths are thus adapted. [2] For example: they who are in 
doctrinal things, and not so much in life, do not know otherwise than that the heavenly kingdom is similar to kingdoms on earth, in that men become great by ruling over others, this delight being the 
only one with which they are acquainted, and which they prefer to every other delight; and therefore the Lord spoke in the Word according to this appearance, as in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Whosoever shall do and 
teach, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 5:19); </p>
<p>and in David: </p>
<p>     I said, Ye are gods, and all of you sons of the Most High (Ps. 82:6; John 10:34, 35). And because 
even the disciples themselves had at first no other opinion respecting the heavenly kingdom than that of greatness and preeminence, as on earth-as is evident in Matthew 18:1; Mark 9:34; Luke 9:46-and 
also had an idea of sitting on the right hand and the left of a king (Matt. 20:20, 21, 24; Mark 10:37), therefore also the Lord replied according to their apprehension and their spirit, saying, when 
there was a contention among them as to which of them should be greatest: </p>
<p>     Ye shall eat and drink at My table in My kingdom; and shall sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel (Luke 
22:30; Matt. 19:28); </p>
<p>for at that time they did not know that heavenly delight is not the delight of greatness and preeminence, but is the delight of humiliation and of the affection of serving others; 
thus of desiring to be least, and not greatest; as the Lord teaches in Luke: </p>
<p>     Whosoever is least among you all, the same shall be great (Luke 9:48). [3] Thus they who are in the memory-knowledge 
of knowledges, and not in the life of charity, cannot know that there is any other delight than that which results from preeminence; and because this is the only delight that is seated in their minds, 
and makes all their life, therefore they are utterly ignorant of the heavenly delight that results from humiliation and the affection of serving others-that is, the delight of love to the Lord and 
of charity toward the neighbor-consequently of the blessedness and happiness thence derived. This is the reason why the Lord spoke in adaptation to their infirmity, that thereby they might be aroused 
and introduced to good, so as to learn, and to teach, and to do it. At the same time He teaches the nature of greatness and preeminence in heaven (Matt. 19:30; 20:16, 25-28; Mark 10:31, 42-45; Luke 
9:48; 13:30; 22:25-28). These and the like are the appearances of truth of a lower degree; for they do become relatively great, preeminent, powerful, and of authority, seeing that a single angel has greater 
power than myriads of infernal spirits, yet not from himself, but from the Lord; and he has it from the Lord in the proportion that he believes that he has no power from himself, thus that he is 
the least; and this he can believe insofar as he is in humiliation and in the affection of being of service to others, that is, insofar as he is in the good of love to the Lord, and of charity toward 
the neighbor. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3417</b></p><p><b>3417.</b>
'And camped in the Valley of Gerar and dwelt there' means that He did so for lower rational concepts, that is, He abandoned interior appearances for exterior. This is clear from the meaning of 'camping' 
as arranging into order, from the meaning of 'the Valley of Gerar' as lower rational concepts or exterior appearances of truth - for 'a valley' means lower things, or what amounts to the same, exterior 
things, <a href="1723.htm">1723</a>, while 'Gerar' means matters of faith and so of truth, <a href="1209.htm">1209</a>, <a href="2504.htm">2504</a>, <a href="3365.htm">3365</a>, <a href="3384.htm">3384</a>, <a href="3385.htm">3385</a>; and from the meaning of 'dwelling' as having one's being and life, dealt with in <a href="3384.htm">3384</a>. From this 
it is evident that 'he camped in the Valley of Gerar and dwelt there' means that the Lord arranged truths so that they would also be suitable for the mental grasp and the disposition of those who are 
not concerned so much with life as they are with matters of doctrine concerning faith, as may be seen from the Word, in which likewise truths are suited to people's ability to grasp them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 For 
example, people who are concerned with matters of doctrine and not so much with life do not know anything other than this, that the heavenly kingdom is like kingdoms on earth, in that people are made 
great there when they govern others. The delight that comes from this is the only delight they know of; and this they prefer to all other delight. For this reason the Lord has also spoken in the Word 
according to that appearance, as in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
He who does and teaches so will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%205:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 5:19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in David, </p>
<blockquote>
I said, You are gods, and sons of the Most High, 
all of you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2082:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 82:6</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2010:34,%2035&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 10:34, 35</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
And because at first the disciples themselves did not have any other conception of the heavenly kingdom than that of greatness and position over others, like 
that on earth - as is clear in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2018:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 18:1</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%209:34&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 9:34</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%209:46&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 9:46</a>, and also the idea of their sitting on the right hand and on the left of a king, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2020:20,%2021,%2024&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 20:20, 21, 24</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2010:37%20-&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 10:37 -</a> 
</blockquote>
the Lord therefore replied 
according to their mental grasp and also inclination of mind when an argument arose among them about which one of them was to be greatest, </p>
<blockquote>
You will eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and 
you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2022:24,%2030&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 22:24, 30</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2019:28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 19:28</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>For at that time they did not know that the delight of heaven is not the delight that goes with being great 
and having position over others, but the delight that goes with being humble and with the affection for serving others; and so it does not consist in wishing to be the greatest but to be the least, 
as the Lord teaches in Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
Whoever presents himself as least among you all will be great. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%209:48&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 9:48</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Thus people who have a knowledge of cognitions but are devoid of the life of charity 
cannot know of the existence of any other delight than that which results from having position over others. And since that delight alone occupies their minds and constitutes the whole of their life, therefore 
they do not have any knowledge at all of the heavenly delight which results from humility and from the affection for serving others. That is, they do not know the delight that accompanies love 
to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour, and the consequent bliss and happiness. The reason why the Lord adapted what He had to say to their imperfect outlook was so that they could be aroused 
and led on to good, to learn it, to teach it, and to do it. And yet He does teach what greatness and position actually are in heaven, as in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2019:30;%2020:16,%2025-28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 19:30; 20:16, 25-28</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2010:31,%2042-45&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 10:31, 42-45</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%209:48;%2013:30;%2022:25-28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 9:48; 13:30; 22:25-28</a>. These and other ideas like them belong to the lower degree of appearances of truth, for in relation to others those in heaven are made great, and are given positions, power, and authority 
over others, in that one single angel is more powerful than ten thousands of spirits in hell, yet not so from himself but from the Lord. And he has that power from the Lord in the measure that he believes 
he can achieve nothing from himself and is accordingly the least. And he is able to have such a belief in the measure that humility and an affection for serving others exist in him, that is, insofar 
as the good that is essentially love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour is present in him. </p>

`Et castrametatus est in valle Geraris, et habitabat ibi': quod significet quod ad rationalia inferiora, seu ab interioribus apparentiis ad exteriores, constat ex significatione `castrametari' quod

et habitabat ibi' significet quod Dominus disposuerit vera, ut quoque adaequata essent captui et genio illorum qui non ita in vita sed in doctrinalibus fidei sunt; ut constare potest a Verbo, ubi 
quoque vera ita sunt. [2] Sit {1}exemplo: qui in doctrinalibus sunt, non ita in vita, non sciunt aliter quam quod regnum caeleste sit simile regnis in tellure in eo quod magni ibi fiant imperando aliis; 
jucundum inde est unicum {2}jucundum quod sciunt, et quod omni alii jucundo praeferunt, quapropter Dominus secundum apparentiam quoque illam in Verbo locutus est, ut apud Matthaeum,           Qui 
facit et docet, hic magnus vocabitur in regno      caelorum, v 19; </p>
<p>et apud Davidem,           Ego dixi, Dii vos, et filii Altissimi omnes vos, Ps.      lxxxii 6; Joh. x 34, 35; </p>
<p>et quia nec ipsi 
discipuli aliam opinionem in principio habuerunt de regno caelesti quam magnitudinis et praeeminentiae, sicut in terra, ut constat apud Matth. xviii 1; Marc. ix 34; Luc. ix 46; et quoque ideam sedentium 
ad dextram et sinistram regis, Matth. xx 20, 21, 24; Marc. x 37, ideo quoque secundum captum et quoque animum illorum {3}respondit Dominus, dicens, (m)cum contentio inter illos existeret quis illorum 
esset maximus,           Comedetis et bibetis super mensa Mea in regno Meo, et      sedebitis super thronis judicantes duodecim tribus Israelis,      Luc. xxii 24, 30; Matth. xix 28;(n) tunc enim 
non sciverunt quod jucundum caeleste non esset jucundum magnitudinis et praeeminentiae, sed jucundum humiliationis et affectionis inserviendi aliis, ita non maximum sed minimum esse velle, ut Dominus 
docet apud Lucam,           Quicumque minimus inter omnes vos existit, hic erit      magnus, ix 48; </p>
<p>[3] ita qui in scientia cognitionum et non in vita charitatis sunt, illi non scire possunt aliud
