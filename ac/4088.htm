<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4088节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4088.</strong>“凡拉班向你所作的，我都看见了”表“拉班”所表示的良善的自我并不是诸如凭它自己行事的那种。这从“拉班”的代表清楚可知，“拉班”是指居间良善，如前面频繁所述。那良善的自我并不是诸如凭它自己行事的那种，就是“凡拉班向你所作的，我都看见了”这句话的意思。这个意思从对内义上的主题的洞察，以及处于这类良善的社群明显看出来。该良善的性质可从这些社群很清楚地看出来，因为他们是充当手段和沟通媒介的灵人社群（参看<a href="4047.htm">4047</a>节）。他们不是那么出于自己和其自我行事的那一类，而是允许自己被其他人引领，因而被天使引向良善，被恶灵引向邪恶。这种特征从此处所记载有关拉班的历史细节，尤其从下文显而易见。这一切表明“拉班”所表示的良善的自我是什么意思，即该良善并不具有凭自己行事的性质。这几节（6-12节）在内义上所包含的这些事只粗略地予以解释，因为它们与前一章所论述的那些事很相似，在那里它们有详细解释。</p>

For I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee. That this signifies the own of the good signified by "Laban," that it is not such as to act from itself, is evident from the representation of Laban, as 
being mediate good, often spoken of before. That its own is not such as to act from itself, is signified by the words, "I have seen all that he doeth unto thee." That this is the signification is evident 
from a mental view of the subject in the internal sense, and also from the societies which are in such good, for from these the quality of this good can be manifestly seen, because they are societies 
of spirits which serve as means and for communication (see n. 4047). These are not such as to do much from themselves and their own, but suffer themselves to be led by others, thus to good by angels, 
and to evil by evil spirits; as is also apparent in the story here told of Laban, especially from what follows. All this shows what is meant by the own of the good signified by "Laban," in that 
this good is not of such a nature as to act of itself. The internal contents of these verses (6-12), have been unfolded only in a summary manner, because they are similar to those which have been treated 
of in the foregoing chapter, where they have been explained more fully. </p>

'For I have seen everything that Laban is doing to you' means that the proprium of the good meant by 'Laban' was not such as acted of itself. This is clear from the representation of 'Laban' as intermediate 
good, often dealt with already. The proprium of that good not being such as acted of itself is the meaning of the statement 'I have seen everything that he is doing to you'. This meaning is evident 
from a discernment of things in the internal sense, and also from the communities which are governed by that kind of good. For the nature of that good can be seen clearly from those communities, 
since they are communities of spirits which serve as means and as a medium of communication, dealt with in <a href="4047.htm">4047</a>. They are not the kind that act very much from themselves and their proprium, but allow 
themselves to be led by others and so to be led to good by angels and to evil by evil spirits. This feature shines even out of the historical details recorded here concerning Laban, and especially out 
of those which follow. This shows what is meant by the proprium of the good meant by 'Laban' - that it is not the kind that acts of itself. These matters which verses 6-12 contain in the internal sense 
have been explained only cursorily, the reason being that they are similar to those dealt with in the previous chapter, where they have been explained more fully. </p>

`Quia vidi omne quod Laban facit tibi': quod significet proprium boni per `Laban' significati, quod non tale ut ex se, constat ex repraesentatione `Labanis' quod sit bonum medium, de qua saepius 
prius: quod ejus proprium non tale sit ut ex se, significatur per `vidi omne quod facit tibi'; quod haec significatio sit, patet ex intuitione rerum in sensu interno, tum ex societatibus quae in tali 
bono sunt, ex his enim manifeste videri potest quale illud bonum est, sunt enim societates (o)spirituum quae inserviunt pro mediis et pro communicatione, de quibus n. 4047; illae non tales sunt 
ut ex se et proprio multum {1} faciant sed patiantur se duci ab aliis, ita ad bonum ab angelis, et ad malum a spiritibus malis, quod etiam elucet ex historicis hic de Labane, imprimis ex illis quae 
sequuntur; inde patet quid intelligitur per proprium boni per `Laban' significati, quod non tale sit ut ex se.  Haec quae in versibus 6-12 in sensu interno continentur, summatim explicata sunt, ex 
causa quia similia sunt illis de quibus in capite praecedente actum est ubi illa plenius explicata sunt {2}.      @1 A d aliquid, i multum$      @2 videantur$ </p>
