<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10189节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10189</strong>.“在它两肋”表与一个方向上的真理，也就是说，与一个方向上的真理结合，并通过它们保存。这从“两肋”的含义清楚可知。当用来表示两旁或两边（sides）时，“两肋”是指真理；因为被称为“两肋”的两旁面向南北，而“南”表示住在光明中的真理（参看<a href="9462.htm">9462</a>节），而“北”表示住在阴影中的真理（<a href="3708.htm">3708</a>节）。但原本意义上的“两旁或两边”表示良善，因为它们面向东西，而“东”表示清晰中的良善，“西”表示模糊中的良善（<a href="3708.htm">3708</a>，<a href="9653.htm">9653</a>节）。故经上在此说：“要从坛边下面给它作两个金环，在它两肋。要在坛两旁作它们”。原本意义上的“两旁或两边”面向东西，而被称为“两肋”的两旁或两边面向南北，这一点明显可见于出埃及记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.13.htm">26:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.26.htm">26:26-27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.35.htm">26:35</a>）。此外，“两肋”因可以支撑胸部，故表示支撑良善的真理。<br />然而，天堂里的布局是这样的：那些住在真理的光明中，因而住在南方的天使在右边，而那些住在真理的阴影中，因而住在北方的天使在左边。那些对良善的感知清晰，因而住在东方的天使在面前，而那些对良善的感知模糊，因而住在西方的天使在背后。住在良善区域的这些天使构成主的属天国度；而住在真理区域的那些天使则构成主的属灵国度。这就是那里的天使看待所布置的一切事物的方式，无论他们转向哪个方向；因为天使拥有常在他们面前的主。但地狱里的人正好相反，因为他们拥有常在他们背后的主。<br />在来世，四个方位不像在世上那样取决于固定区域，而是取决于固定的主导爱。<br />因为一位天使或一个灵人就是他自己的爱，这爱在哪里，他就转向哪里。那些处于对主之爱和对邻之仁，并由此处于信的人看见主在自己面前，无论他们的脸和身体转向哪里。因为主将他们转向祂自己；祂经东方的路进入他们，使他们不断注视祂自己。结果，他们的外在视觉受属于其理解力的内在视觉的控制，这内在视觉则受属于其意愿的爱的控制，所以他们的外在视觉顺着这爱把它带到的方向观看。就构成其灵的内层而言，世人也一样。此外，在来世，所有人都照着他们所转向的方向而被区分开来。来世的空间和位置就具有上面所描述的这种性质，它们由此而表示状态（参看<a href="2625.htm">2625</a>，<a href="2837.htm">2837</a>，<a href="3356.htm">3356</a>，<a href="3387.htm">3387</a>，<a href="4321.htm">4321</a>，<a href="4882.htm">4882</a>，<a href="5605.htm">5605</a>，<a href="7381.htm">7381</a>，<a href="9440.htm">9440</a>，<a href="9667.htm">9667</a>，<a href="10146.htm">10146</a>节）。</p>

Upon its two ribs. That this signifies conjunction with truths on the one side, and preservation by means of them, is evident from the signification of "ribs," when by them are meant sides, as being 
truths; for the sides which are called "ribs" look to the south and the north, and by the "south" is signified truth in light (see n. 9462), and by the "north" truth in shade (n. 3708). But by "sides" 
properly so called is signified good, because they look to the east and the west, and by the "east" is signified good in clearness, and by the "west" good in obscurity (n. 3708, 9653). Therefore it is 
here said, "thou shalt make for it two rings of gold from beneath the border, upon the two ribs thereof thou shalt make them, upon the two sides thereof." That the sides properly so called look to the 
east and the west, but that the sides which are called "ribs" look to the south and the north, is plain in Exodus 26:13, 26, 27, 35. Moreover "ribs," being supports of the breast, signify the truths 
that support good. [2] In heaven however the case is this. On the right are those who are in the light of truth, thus who are in the south; but on the left are those who are in the shade of truth, 
thus who are in the north; before the face are those who are in the clear perception of good, thus who are in the east; but at the back are those who are in the obscure perception of good, thus who are 
in the west. These, who are in good, constitute the celestial kingdom of the Lord; and the former, who are in truth, constitute His spiritual kingdom. This is the appearance to the angels there in whatever 
direction they turn themselves, for the angels have the Lord, who is the very East, continually before the face; but the contrary is the case with those who are in hell, for these have the Lord 
continually at the back. [3] For in the other life the quarters are not determined toward fixed regions, as they are in the world; but according to fixed and ruling loves.  [4] For an angel or a spirit 
is his own love, and where the love is, thither he turns himself; they who are in love to the Lord and in charity toward the neighbor, and from this in faith, look at the Lord before them wherever 
they turn their bodies and their faces. For the Lord turns them to Himself, because He enters by the way of the east into them, and constantly keeps them in a determination toward Himself. Hence their 
external sight, determined by the internal sight that belongs to the understanding, and this by the love that belongs to the will, looks in the direction in which the love carries it. It is similar 
with men in the world in respect to their interiors that belong to their spirit. Moreover, in the other life all are distinguished according to the way in which each one turns himself. (That the spaces 
and places in the other life are of this nature, and that from this they signify states, see n. 2625, 2837, 3356, 3387, 4321, 4882, 5605, 7381, 9440, 9667, 10146.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10189</b></p><p><b>10189.</b>
'On its two ribs' means with truths lying in one direction, that is to say, a joining together with them and preservation by means of them. This is clear from the meaning of 'the ribs', when used to 
mean the sides, as truths; for the sides that are called 'the ribs' face the south and the north, and 'the south' means truth dwelling in light, <a href="9642.htm">9642</a>, while 'the north' means truth dwelling in shade, <a href="3708.htm">3708</a>. But by 'the sides' which are properly the sides good is meant since these face the east and the west, and 'the east' means good set in clearness and 'the west' good set in obscurity, <a href="3708.htm">3708</a>, <a href="9653.htm">9653</a>. 
Therefore it says here,  </p>
<p>Two rings of gold you shall make for it under the rim; on its two ribs you shall make them, on its two sides.  </p>
<p>The fact that the sides which are properly the sides face 
the east and the west, whereas the sides which are called 'the ribs' face the south and the north is evident in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2026:13,26,27,35&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 26:13,26,27,35</a><A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>. Furthermore since the ribs serve to reinforce the chest truths giving 
support to good are meant by them.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In heaven however the layout is such that to the right there are those who dwell in the light of truth, thus who are in the south, but to the left those 
who dwell in the shade of truth, thus who are in the north. Before one's face there are those whose perception of good is clear, thus who are in the east, but behind one's back there are those whose 
perception of good is dim, thus who are in the west. These angels dwelling in the regions of good constitute the Lord's celestial kingdom, but the others dwelling in the regions of truth constitute the 
Lord's spiritual kingdom. This is how the angels there, whichever way they turn, see everything to be laid out; for angels have the Lord, who is the East, unceasingly in front of their face. But the 
contrary is so with those in hell, for they have the Lord unceasingly behind their back. </p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the next life the four quarters are not determined, as they are in the world, by where fixed regions lie, 
but by ruling loves that remain fixed. </p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 For his love makes an angel or a spirit what he is, and where that love is, in that direction he turns. Those in whom love to the Lord and charity towards 
the neighbour reign, and therefore in whom faith is present, behold the Lord in front of themselves whichever way they turn their face and body. For the Lord turns them towards Himself; He enters them 
by the way from the east and keeps them fixed unceasingly on Himself. As a consequence - since their outward sight is under the control of the inward sight belonging to their understanding, and this 
inward sight is under the control of the love belonging to their will - their outward sight looks in the direction in which that love bears it. It is similar with people in the world so far as their 
interiors, which constitute their spirit, are concerned. Also, all in the next life are identified, every one, by the direction in which they turn.  </p>
<p>As regards things of a spatial nature and locations 
in the next life, that they are of the same nature as those described above, and that they therefore mean states, see <a href="2625.htm">2625</a>, <a href="2837.htm">2837</a>, <a href="3356.htm">3356</a>, <a href="3387.htm">3387</a>, <a href="4321.htm">4321</a>, <a href="4882.htm">4882</a>, <a href="5605.htm">5605</a>, <a href="7381.htm">7381</a>, <a href="9440.htm">9440</a>, <a href="9967.htm">9967</a>, <a href="10146.htm">10146</a>.

`Super duabus costis ejus': quod significet cum veris ab una parte, nempe conjunctio, et per illa conservatio, constat ex significatione `costarum' cum per illas intelliguntur latera, quod sint vera, 
nam latera, quae costae {1}vocantur, spectant meridiem et septentrionem, et per `meridiem' (x)significatur verum in luce, n. (x)9642, et per `septentrionem' verum in umbra, n. 3708; at per `latera,' 
quae proprie latera vocantur, significatur bonum, quoniam illa spectant orientem et occidentem, et per `orientem' significatur bonum in claro et per `occidentem' bonum in obscuro, n. 3708, 9653; ideo 
hic dicitur, Duos annulos auri facies ei desub limbo, super duabus costis ejus facies, super duobus lateribus ejus. Quod latera quae proprie latera, spectent orientem et occidentem, at latera quae costae 
dicuntur, spectent meridiem et (x)septentrionem, patet in Exodo xxvi 13, 26, 27, 35; etiam per `costas,' quia sunt fulcimina pectoris, significantur vera sustentantia bonum. 	[2] In caelo autem 
ita se habet: ad dextram ibi sunt illi qui in luce veri sunt, ita qui in meridie, ad sinistrum autem illi qui in umbra veri, ita qui in septentrione; ante faciem sunt illi qui in {2}clara perceptione 
boni, ita qui in oriente, ad tergum autem qui in {3}obscura perceptione boni, ita qui in occidente; hi qui in bono sunt constituunt regnum caeleste Domini, {4}illi autem qui in vero sunt constituunt regnum 
spirituale Domini; haec apparentia est angelis ibi quocumque se vertunt, nam angeli ante faciem jugiter habent Dominum, Qui est ipse Oriens; contrarium autem est illis qui in inferno sunt, nam hi 
ad tergum jugiter 3habent Dominum; {5}nam in altera vita non sunt plagae sicut in mundo, determinatae ad statas regiones, sed secundum statos et regnantes amores; {6}angelus enim et spiritus est suus 
amor, et ubi ille est, illuc se 4vertit; qui in amore in Dominum sunt et in charitate erga proximum, et inde in fide, spectant ante se Dominum in omni versione sui corporis {7}cum sua facie; Dominus 
enim illos ad Se vertit, intrat enim per viam orientis in illos, et tenet illos jugiter in determinatione ad Se; inde visus externus illorum determinatus a visu interno, qui est intellectus, et hic ab 
amore qui est voluntatis, spectat quo fert amor; similiter se habet cum hominibus in mundo quoad interiora (d)eorum, quae sunt spiritus eorum; ex versione cujusvis etiam internoscuntur omnes in {8}altera 
vita. Quod spatia et loca in altera vita non aliter se habeant et quod inde significent status, videatur n. 2625, 2837, (x)3356, 3387, 4321, 4882, (x)5605, 7381, 9440, 9967, 10,146. @1 dicuntur$ @2
