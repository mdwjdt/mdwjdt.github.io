<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10049节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10049</strong>.“洗净肠”表最低事物的洁净。这从“洗净”和“肠”的含义清楚可知：“洗净”是指洁净（参看<a href="3147.htm">3147</a>，<a href="5954.htm">5954</a>e，<a href="9089.htm">9089</a>节），洗净所代表的洁净是指从邪恶与虚假中洁净，因为这些就是灵义上的污垢；“肠”是指最低事物（参看<a href="10030.htm">10030</a>节）。经上之所以说要洗净肠和腿，是因为它们表示最低事物和属世事物，最低或属世的事物被邪恶与虚假玷污，比内层事物更甚。事实上，这些邪恶与虚假基于世界，是最低的感官事物，暴露于世界，因而直接接受世界上的东西，或说受世界影响。他们所接受的东西或影响就是爱自己爱世界的快乐，连同感官的快乐和幻觉。但内层事物则不然，因为这些并不基于世界，而是基于天堂。此外，世界的事物无法进入天堂的事物，因为物质的流注不可能存在；相反，天堂事物能进入与人同在的世界事物。因此，一旦外在人想要进入内在，这种事是通过出于爱自己爱世界的快乐和感官幻觉做到的，内在人就被关闭；主规定这一切。因此，当一个人正在重生时，内在人的洁净就在天堂由主实现。因此，人在世时看不到重生期间在他的内在人中正在达成的事。这就是主在约翰福音中所说这些话的意思：<br />灵随着意思吹，你听见它的响声，却不晓得它从哪里来，往哪里去；凡从灵生的，也是如此。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.8.htm">3:8</a>）<br />“灵”是指经由信而来的仁之生活</p>

And shalt wash its intestines. That this signifies the purification of the lowest things, is evident from the signification of "washing," as being to purify (see n. 3147, 5954, 9089); the purification 
that was represented by washing is purification from evils and falsities, for these are impurities in the spiritual sense; and from the signification of the "intestines," as being the lowest things 
(see above, n. 10030). It is said that the intestines and the legs were to be washed, because by them are signified lowest and natural things, and lowest or natural things are more defiled with evils 
and falsities than the interior ones; for those evils and falsities are in the world, and sensuous things, which are lowest, stand forth in the world, and therefore immediately receive what is in the 
world. The things which they receive are the delights of the loves of self and of the world, together with the delights of the senses and their fallacies. But the interior things are not so, for these 
are not in the world, but in heaven, and the things which are of the world cannot enter into those which are of heaven, physical influx being impossible; whereas the things of heaven can enter into those 
which are of the world with man.  Therefore as soon as the external man seeks to enter into the internal, which is done by means of reasonings from the loves of self and of the world, and from the 
fallacies of the senses, the internal man is closed. Thus does the Lord provide; and therefore the purification of the internal man during man's regeneration is effected in heaven by the Lord. Consequently, 
while a man is in the world he does not perceive what is being accomplished in his internal man during regeneration. This is what is meant by the words of the Lord in John: </p>
<p>     The spirit 
bloweth where it will, and thou hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh, and whither it goeth; so is everyone that is born of the spirit (John 3:8); </p>
<p>"the spirit" denotes the life 
of charity through faith. </p>

'And wash the intestines' means purification of the lowest things. This is clear from the meaning of 'washing' as purifying, dealt with in <a href="3147.htm">3147</a>, <a href="5954.htm">5954</a>(end), <a href="9088.htm">9088</a> (the purification that was represented 
by washing is a purification from evils and falsities, for these are what dirt is in the spiritual sense); and from the meaning of 'the intestines' as lowest things, dealt with above in <a href="10030.htm">10030</a>. The reason 
why it says that the intestines and legs had to be washed is that lowest things and natural things are meant by them, and lowest and natural things are sullied by evils and falsities, more so than 
interior ones. For they are based in the world, and the things of the senses - the lowest of all - stand exposed to the world and are therefore in direct receipt of influences from the world. Those 
influences enter them as the delights of self-love and love of the world, along with the delights of the senses and the illusions of the senses. But this is not so with interior things, for these are 
not based in the world but in heaven. Furthermore the things of the world cannot pass into those of heaven, for there is no such thing as physical influx; but the things of heaven can pass into those 
of the world present with a person. Therefore as soon as the external man wishes to enter the internal, which is done by means of reasonings that are products of self-love and love of the world, and products 
of the illusions of the senses, the internal man is closed; the Lord sees to this. Therefore when a person is being regenerated the purification of the internal man is effected in heaven by the 
Lord, with the consequence that while in the world the person does not see what is being accomplished in his internal man. These things are the ones that should be understood by the Lord's words in 
John,  </p>

The spirit breathes where it wishes, and you hear its voice; but you do not know where it comes from and where it goes away to. So is everyone who is born from the spirit. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3:8</a>.

<p>'The 
spirit' is the life of charity through faith.  </p>

`Et lavabis intestina': quod significet purificationem infimorum, constat ex significatione `lavare' quod sit purificare, de qua n. 3147, 5954 fin., (x)9088; purificatio, quae per lavationem repraesentabatur 
{1}, est purificatio a malis et falsis, nam haec sunt sordes in spirituali sensu; et ex significatione intestinorum, quod sint infima, de qua supra n. (x)10,030.  Quod dicatur quod intestina 
et crura lavanda essent, est quia per illa significantur infima et naturalia, ac infima et naturalia sunt conspurcata malis et falsis prae interioribus; sunt enim illa in mundo, ac sensualia {2}, quae 
sunt infima, exstant mundo, ac ideo {3} immediate recipiunt illa quae in mundo sunt; (o)illa quae recipiant sunt jucunda amorum sui et mundi cum jucundis sensuum et eorum fallaciis; interiora autem 
non ita, nam haec {4} non sunt in mundo, sed in caelo; ac illa quae mundi sunt non intrare possunt in illa quae caeli sunt, influxus enim physicus non datur, sed illa quae caeli sunt intrare possunt in 
illa quae mundi (o)apud hominem; quapropter ut primum externus homo vult se immittere in internum, quod fit per ratiocinia ex amoribus sui et (o)mundi, atque ex fallaciis sensuum, clauditur internus 
homo; ita providet Dominus; quapropter purificatio interni hominis, cum regeneratur homo, fit in caelo a Domino; inde est quod homo cum in mundo est, non percipiat quid peragitur in interno suo homine 
cum regeneratur; haec sunt quae intelliguntur {5} per Domini verba apud Johannem,      	Spiritus ubi vult spirat, et vocem ejus audis, atqui non scis unde venit et quo abit; sic est omnis qui generatus 
est a spiritu, iii 8; </p>
<p>`spiritus' est vita charitatis per fidem. @1 significatur$ @2 i externa$ @3 inde$ @4 ea$ @5 hoc est quo intelligitur$ </p>
