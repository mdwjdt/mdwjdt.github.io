<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8805节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8805.</strong>“摩西下山往百姓那里去”表通过从神来的真理的运用和准备，以便真理能在良善里面被接受。这从“下”和“山”的含义，以及“摩西”和“以色列人”的代表清楚可知：当论及代表从神来的真理的“摩西”时，“下”是指通过这真理的运用，以及准备；“摩西”是指从神来的真理（参看<a href="8760.htm">8760</a>，<a href="8787.htm">8787</a>节），也指一个中间人（<a href="8787.htm">8787</a>节），因而同样指准备和运用；“山”是指天堂里的神性，因而是指天使本身；“以色列人”是指那些属于属灵教会的人，因而是指那些处于良善到来所经由的真理，以及真理所源于的良善，在此即真理要在其中被接受的良善之人。知道“西乃山”具体表示什么，以及“以色列人”代表什么，同样出埃及记中本章和随后章节中的“摩西”代表什么，是很重要的。<br />具体来说，“西乃山”表示天堂，真理由主那里从天堂流入；因此，“耶和华降临那山”表示祂在天堂的同在。由于“西乃山”表示天堂，耶和华，也就是主在其中，所以它也表示与那里的神性真理合一的神性良善；因为使得天堂成为天堂的，就是这神性良善。<br />这山旁的“以色列人”代表信之真理要被植入其中的良善方面的属灵教会。前面早已说明，那些属于属灵教会的人经历两种状态。第一种或前一种状态是在他们通过真理被引向良善之时，第二种或后一种状态则在他们处于良善，并通过良善处于真理之时。目前这种状态是他们处于信之真理要被植入其中的良善之时的状态，这种状态是前一种状态和后一种状态，或说第一种状态和第二种状态之间的一个中间状态。被植入良善的真理就包含在主从西乃山所宣布，以及摩西向百姓所传达的那些事里面。<br />在本章和随后章节，“摩西”代表在天堂之下、与天堂里的神之真理相结合的从神来的真理。因此，他代表天堂里的神性与真理要被植入其中的良善，就是属灵教会的良善之间的中间人，因而代表主与这百姓之间的中间人。知道这些事对于理解出埃及记中接下来的经文是很重要的。由此也可以看出，“摩西下山往百姓那里去”表示通过从神来的真理的运用和准备，以便真理能在良善里面被接受。</p>

And Moses went down from the mountain unto the people. That this signifies application and preparation through truth from the Divine for receiving truths in good, is evident from the signification of 
"going down," when said of Moses, by whom is represented truth from the Divine, as being application, and also preparation, through it; from the representation of Moses, as being truth from the Divine 
(see n. 8760, 8787), and also as being what mediates (n. 8787), thus likewise what prepares and applies; from the signification of "the mountain," as being the Divine in heaven, thus heaven; and from 
the representation of the sons of Israel, as being those who are of the spiritual church, thus those who are in truth through which is good, and in good from which is truth, here in the good in which 
truths are to be received. It is important to know what is specifically signified by "Mount Sinai;" and also what is represented by the people Israel, and likewise what by Moses in this chapter and 
in the following chapters of the book of Exodus. [2] By "MOUNT SINAI" is specifically signified heaven, out of which truths flow in from the Lord; therefore by "the coming down of Jehovah upon that mountain" 
is signified His presence in heaven. And as heaven, in which Jehovah is, that is, the Lord, is signified by "Mount Sinai," by it is also signified Divine good united to Divine truth there, for 
from this heaven is heaven. [3] But by the "PEOPLE ISRAEL" near this mountain is represented the spiritual church as to the good in which the truths of faith are to be implanted; for it has been already 
shown that they who are of the spiritual church have two states; the former when they are led through truths to good, the latter when they are in good and from good in truths; in the present case, 
when they are in the good in which truths are to be implanted, which state is a middle state between the former and the latter. The truths which are implanted in good are contained in those things 
which were promulgated from Mount Sinai by the Lord, and were communicated by Moses to the people. [4] By "MOSES" in this chapter and in the following chapters is represented truth from the Divine beneath 
heaven conjoined with truth Divine in heaven, and consequently mediating between the Divine in heaven and the good in which truths are to be implanted which belongs to the spiritual church, thus 
mediating between the Lord and the people. It is important to know these things for the sake of understanding what follows in the book of Exodus. From all this it can also be seen that by "Moses went 
down from the mountain unto the people" is signified application and preparation by means of truth from the Divine for receiving truths in good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8805</b></p><p><b>8805.</b>
'And Moses went down from the mountain to the people' means application and preparation by the truth from God, in order that truths may be received within good. This is clear from the meaning of 'going 
down' - when said of 'Moses', who represents the truth from God - as application and also preparation by that truth; from the representation of 'Moses' as the truth from God, dealt with in <a href="8760.htm">8760</a>, <a href="8787.htm">8787</a>, 
which also acts as an intermediary, <a href="8787.htm">8787</a>, thus which also prepares and applies; from the meaning of 'the mountain' as the Divine within heaven, thus heaven itself; and from the representation of 'the 
children of Israel' as those belonging to the spiritual Church, thus those guided by truth through which good comes, and governed by good from which truth springs, at this point good in which truths 
are to be received. It is important to know what is meant specifically by 'Mount Sinai' in this and subsequent chapters of the Book of Exodus, also what is represented by 'the people Israel', and what 
by 'Moses' as well. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Specifically Mount Sinai means heaven, out of which truths flow in from the Lord. Consequently 'Jehovah came down onto that mountain' means His presence in heaven. And since 
heaven - in which Jehovah, that is, the Lord, is present - is meant by 'Mount Sinai', Divine Good united to Divine Truth there is also meant by it; for these are what make it heaven. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But The 
People Israel beside this mountain represent the spiritual Church in respect of good in which the truths of faith are to be implanted. It has been shown already that those belonging to the spiritual 
Church pass through two states. The first is when they are led by means of truths to good, and the second state is when they are governed by good and consequently by truths. At this point the state 
is one when they are governed by good in which truths are to be implanted, which state is an intermediate state that comes between those first and second ones. The truths that are implanted within good 
are contained in those which were declared by the Lord from Mount Sinai and conveyed by Moses to the people. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Moses in this and subsequent chapters represents the truth from God below heaven joined 
to God's truth in heaven. He therefore represents the intermediary between the Divine in heaven and the good in which truths are to be implanted, the spiritual Church's good, and so represents the 
intermediary between the Lord and the people. </p>
<p>It is important to know these things for the understanding of what follows below in the Book of Exodus. All this also shows that 'Moses went down from 
the mountain to the people' means application and preparation through the truth from God for truths to be received within good. </p>

`Et descendit Moscheh de monte ad populum': quod significet applicationem et praeparationem per verum a Divino ad recipiendum vera in bono, constat ex significatione `descendere' cum dicitur de `Mosche,' 
per quem repraesentatur verum a Divino, quod sit applicatio et quoque praeparatio per illud; ex repraesentatione `Moschis' quod sit verum a Divino, de qua n. 8760, 8787, et quoque quod sit medians, 
n. 8787, ita quoque praeparans et applicans; ex significatione `montis' quod sit Divinum in caelo, ita caelum; et ex repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis' quod sint qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, ita 
qui in vero per quod bonum, et in bono ex quo verum, hic in bono in quo recipienda vera.  Interest {1}scire quid in specie significatur per `montem Sinai,' tum quid {2}repraesentatur per `populum Israelem,' 
ut et quid per `Moschen' {3}in hoc capite et in sequentibus Libri Exodi. 	2 Per {4}`montem Sinai' in specie significatur caelum, e quo a Domino vera influunt; inde per quod `Jehovah descendit 
super montem illum' significatur praesentia Ipsius in caelo; et quia caelum, in quo Jehovah, hoc est, Dominus, per `montem Sinai' significatur, etiam per illum significatur Divinum Bonum unitum Divino 
Vero ibi, nam inde caelum est caelum. 	3 Per {4}`populum' autem {4}`Israelem' juxta hunc montem repraesentatur Ecclesia spiritualis quoad bonum in quo vera fidei implantanda sunt, nam prius ostensum 
est quod illis qui ab Ecclesia spirituali bini status sint, prior cum per vera ducuntur ad bonum, posterior cum in bono sunt et ex illo in veris; hic cum in bono cui vera implantanda sunt, qui status 
est status medius inter priorem et posteriorem; vera quae implantantur bono continentur in illis quae e monte Sinai a Domino promulgata sunt, et per Moschen communicata populo. 	4 Per {4}`Moschen' repraesentatur 
in hoc capite et in sequentibus verum a Divino infra caelum conjunctum vero Divino in caelo, (c)ac inde medians inter Divinum in caelo ac inter bonum cui implantanda vera, quod est Ecclesiae 
spiritualis, ita medians inter Dominum et populum.  Haec scire interest propter intellectum sequentium in Libro Exodi.  Ex his {5}etiam constare potest quod per `descendit (x)Moscheh de monte ad 
populum' significetur applicatio et praeparatio per verum a Divino ad recipiendum vera in bono. 	@1 ut sciatur$ 	@2 quoque$ 	@3 hic repraesentatur, nam quae ab hoc capite ad finem libri Exodi continentur 
sunt illa quae a Jehovah e monte promulgata sunt, et per Moschen communicata populo$ 	@4 Printed in capital letters in IT$ 	@5 nunc$ </p>
