<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8168节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8168.</strong>“不要管我们，容我们服事埃及人”表他们不会从投降中被拉回来。这从“不要管我们”和“服事埃及人”的含义清楚可知：当论及侵扰时，“不要管我们”是指不阻止、不拉回来；“服事埃及人”是指像被打败的人一样向那些通过虚假侵扰的人投降。“不要管我们”当在一种侵扰的状态下，以及在一种试探和由“摩西”所代表的神之真理流注的状态下来说时，表示不阻止，不拒绝，这是因为在这些状态下，有两种力量或能力在他们里面起作用：其中一种来自地狱注入外在人的虚假，一种来自主灌输给内在人的真理（<a href="8164.htm">8164</a>节）。这两种力量相互作用。地狱所注入的虚假从人里面的自我之爱和尘世之爱获得自己的力量和能力；而主所灌输的真理则从对邻之爱和对主之爱获得自己的力量和能力。当人得胜时，内在力量和能力总是占上风，因为这是神性；它不允许虚假所拥有的力量或能力变得太过强大，以至于它无法被击退。因此，当这两种力量起作用时，来自主的内在力量可以说不断把此人拉回来，阻止他，免得虚假把他拖下来，从而使他屈服。因为一个普遍规则是：当两种力量相互对立时，一种向前拉，一种向后拉。在灵界，力量是属于各种不同爱的情感；它们起作用所用的工具是真理，在反面意义上是虚假。</p>

Cease from us, and let us serve the Egyptians. That this signifies that they would not be withheld from surrendering, is evident from the signification of "to cease from us," when said of infestations, 
as being not to hinder, and not to withhold; and from the signification of "serving the Egyptians," as being to surrender to those who infest by means of falsities. That "to cease from us," when said 
in a state of infestations, and also in a state of temptations, of the influx of truth Divine represented by Moses, denotes not to hinder, and not to withhold, is because in these states two forces 
or powers are acting, one of which is from the falsities that are injected from the hells into the external man, and the other of which is from truths that are insinuated by the Lord into the internal 
man (n. 8164). These two forces act reciprocally against each other. The falsities injected from the hells have their force and power from the love of self and of the world, which are in the man; but 
the truths insinuated by the Lord have their force and power from love toward the neighbor and love to the Lord. When the man conquers, the internal force or power always prevails, because this is Divine; 
and it does not admit the force or power from falsities to be increased further than it can be repelled. Therefore when these two forces act, the internal force which is from the Lord continually 
as it were withholds the man and hinders him, lest the falsities drag him down, thus causing him to yield; for it is a general rule that when two forces act in opposition to each other, one draws and 
the other draws back. In the spiritual world, forces are the affections which are of the loves; and the instrumentalities by which they act are truths, and in the opposite sense, falsities. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8168</b></p><p><b>8168.</b>
'Leave us alone, and let us serve the Egyptians' means that they would not be drawn back from surrendering themselves. This is clear from the meaning of 'leaving us alone', when said with regard to molestations, 
as not preventing and not drawing back; and from the meaning of 'serving the Egyptians' as giving themselves up, like those who have been vanquished, to those who molest by means of falsities, 
thus that they would surrender themselves. The reason for the meaning of 'leaving us alone' - when addressed, in a state of molestations and also in a state of temptations, to the influx of God's 
truth, which 'Moses' represents - as not preventing and not drawing back is that two forces or powers are at work in them. One comes from the falsities cast by the hells into the external man, the other 
from the truths instilled by the Lord into the internal man, <a href="8164.htm">8164</a>. These two forces act one against the other. The falsities which are cast in by the hells derive their force and power from the self-love 
and love of the world that are within a person; but the truths which are instilled by the Lord derive their force and power from love towards the neighbour and love to the Lord. When a person 
is victorious the internal force and power is always prevalent, because it is Divine; and it does not allow the force or power the falsities possess to become too great for it to be repulsed. When therefore 
those two forces act the internal force from the Lord is constantly drawing the person back so to speak; it prevents falsities from dragging him down and his consequently going under. For it is 
a general rule that when two forces act in opposition to each other, one is drawing forward, the other back. In the spiritual world forces are affections belonging to different kinds of love; the instruments 
by means of which they act are truths, and in the contrary sense falsities. </p>

`Cessa a nobis, et serviamus Aegyptiis': quod significet quod non retraherentur quin se dedant, constat (c)a significatione `cessare a nobis' quod sit cum de infestationibus dicitur, non inhibere et 
non retrahere {1}; et (c)ex significatione `servire Aegyptiis' quod sit se dare victos illis qui per falsa infestant, ita quin se dedant.  Quod `cessare a nobis,' cum {2}in statu infestationum et quoque 
in statu tentationum dicitur de influxu veri Divini, quod per `Moschen' repraesentatur, sit non inhibere et non retrahere, est quia binae vires seu potentiae in illis agunt, una quae {3}ex falsis 
quae injiciuntur ab infernis in externum hominem, altera quae est (c)ex veris quae insinuantur a Domino in internum, n. (x)8164; hae binae vires agunt contra se mutuo; falsa quae injiciuntur ab infernis 
vim et potentiam suam habent ab amore sui et mundi {4}qui in homine; at vera quae insinuantur a Domino vim et potentiam suam habent ab amore erga proximum et in Dominum; cum vincit homo, tunc praevalet 
semper vis {5}et potentia interna, quia haec est Divina; quae nec admittit ut vis seu potentia a falsis ultra augeatur quam ut repelli queat; cum itaque binae hae vires agunt, tunc vis interna {6},
