<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1441.</strong>“示剑”表示这些事物。这从以下事实也清楚可知，示剑可以说是从叙利亚或哈兰启程前往迦南地后所到的第一站；由于“迦南”表示爱的属天事物，故显而易见，“示剑”表示属天事物显现的第一个阶段。当雅各从哈兰回到迦南地时，他同样来到示剑，这从以下经文明显可知：<br />雅各就往疏割去，在那里为自己盖造房屋，又为牲畜搭棚；因此那地方名叫疏割（就是“棚”的意思）。雅各从巴旦亚兰回来的时候，到了迦南地的示剑城，在城的前面支搭帐棚。他在那里筑了一座坛。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创33.17.htm">33:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创33.20.htm">20</a>）<br />“示剑”在此也表第一道光。诗篇：<br />神已经指着祂的圣洁说，我要欢乐，我要分开示剑，丈量疏割谷。基列是我的，玛拿西也是我的，以法莲是我的头盔，犹大是我的杖，摩押是我的沐浴盆，我要向以东抛鞋。我要向非利士人唱凯歌。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗60.6.htm">60:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗60.8.htm">8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗108.7.htm">108:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗108.9.htm">9</a>）<br />“示剑”在此也有相同的含义。这些名字，包括“示剑”，无非表示真实事物。这从关于大卫的这些预言明显看出来，否则它们只不过是一堆名字而已。示剑也因此成为逃城（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书20.7.htm">20:7</a>），以及祭司的城（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书21.21.htm">21:21</a>），并在那里立约（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书24.1.htm">24:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/书24.25.htm">25</a>）等等。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1441.</strong> The symbolism of Shechem as these qualities can also be seen from the consideration that Shechem is the first stopping place in the land of Canaan as you come from Syria, or Haran. Because the land of Canaan symbolizes love's heavenly aspects, it stands to reason that Shechem symbolizes the first disclosure of heavenly attributes. When Jacob returned from Haran to the land of Canaan, he too came to Shechem, as these verses show:<br />Jacob traveled to Succoth and built himself a house, and for his livestock he made shelters; so he called the name of the place Succoth.{*1} And Jacob came to Salem (the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan) when he came from Paddan-aram, and he camped in front of the city and raised an altar there. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1441/bible_king-james-version_genesis_33_17" target=_top>Genesis 33:17</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1441/bible_king-james-version_genesis_33_18" target=_top>18</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1441/bible_king-james-version_genesis_33_19" target=_top>19</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1441/bible_king-james-version_genesis_33_20" target=_top>20</a>)<br />Here again Shechem symbolizes first light.<br />[2] In David:<br />God has spoken in his holiness: "I will exult. I will cleave Shechem, and the valley of Succoth I will measure out. I own Gilead, and I own Manasseh, and Ephraim is the strength of my head.{*2} Judah is my lawgiver. Moab is my wash basin. On Edom I will set my shoe; over Philistia I will trumpet." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1441/bible_king-james-version_psalms_60_6-7" target=_top>Psalms 60:6-7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1441/bible_king-james-version_psalms_60_8" target=_top>8</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1441/bible_king-james-version_psalms_108_7-8" target=_top>108:7-8</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1441/bible_king-james-version_psalms_108_9" target=_top>9</a>)<br />Shechem has a similar kind of symbolism here too. These prophetic words of David's clearly illustrate the fact that names, including that of Shechem, have no meaning but a symbolic one; otherwise the prophecy would be hardly anything besides a conglomeration of names.<br />Shechem became a city of refuge (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1441/bible_king-james-version_joshua_20_7" target=_top>Joshua 20:7</a>) and a city of priests as well (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1441/bible_king-james-version_joshua_21_21" target=_top>Joshua 21:21</a>), and a pact was struck there (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1441/bible_king-james-version_joshua_24_1" target=_top>Joshua 24:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1441/bible_king-james-version_joshua_24_25" target=_top>25</a>). These facts involve something similar.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Succoth is a Hebrew word (住只讻旨谠止转 [sukk艒峁痌) for temporary shelters made of interwoven branches, most commonly associated with the so-called "Feast of Booths" described in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1441/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_23_34-43" target=_top>Leviticus 23:34-43</a>.

[LHC]<br />{*2} The Latin robur capitis mei, here translated "the strength of my head," is a literal rendering of the underlying Hebrew, 诪指注谠止讝钬?钬ㄖ棺愖┳佒醋?(m腻钬樏磟 r艒拧卯). It may be understood as a figurative reference to a helmet. [LHC] </p>

That these things are signified by "Shechem," is also evident from the fact that Shechem is as it were the first station in the land of Canaan, in journeying from Syria, or from Haran; and as the celestial 
things of love are signified by "the land of Canaan," it is evident that their first appearing is signified by Shechem. When Jacob returned from Haran into the land of Canaan, he in like manner 
came to Shechem, as is evident from the following passage: </p>
<p>     Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him a house, and made booths for his cattle; therefore he called the name of the place Succoth. 
And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram, and encamped before the city. And he erected there an altar (Gen. 33:17-20); </p>
<p>where also by 
" Shechem" is signified the first of light. In David: </p>
<p>     God hath spoken in His holiness I will exult, I will divide Shechem, and will mete out the valley of Succoth; Gilead is Mine and Manasseh is 
Mine and Ephraim is the strength of Mine head; Judah is My lawgiver; Moab is My wash-pot; upon Edom will I cast My shoe; over Philistia will I sound in triumph (Ps. 60:6-8; 108:7-9); </p>
<p>where the signification 
of "Shechem" is similar. That names signify nothing else than actual things [res], and that so also does "Shechem," may be plainly seen from these prophetic sayings of David; for otherwise they 
would be little but an accumulation of names. That Shechem was made a city of refuge (Josh. 20:7), and also a city of the priests (Josh. 21:21), and that a covenant was made there (Josh. 24:1, 25), 
involve also what is similar. </p>

That these things are meant by 'Shechem' becomes clear also from the fact that Shechem is so to speak the first stopping-place in the land of Canaan that one comes to when journeying from Syria, or Haran. 
And since 'the land of Canaan' means the celestial things of love it is clear that 'Shechem' means the first stage in the appearance of celestial things When Jacob returned from Haran to the land 
of Canaan he likewise came to Shechem, as becomes clear from the following, </p>
<blockquote>
Jacob travelled on to Succoth and built a house for himself, and made shelters<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> for his cattle; therefore he called the 
name of the place Succoth. And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-Aram; and he camped before the city. And he set up an altar there. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2033:17-20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 33:17-20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'Shechem' means the first appearance of light. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
God has spoken in His holiness, I will exult, I will divide up Shechem and portion out the valley of Succoth. Gilead 
is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine; and Ephraim is the strength of My head, Judah is My lawgiver, Moab is My washbasin, upon Edom I will cast My shoe, over Philistia I will make a loud noise. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2060:6%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 60:6 8</a>; 
108:7, <a href="9.htm">9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'Shechem' has a similar meaning. That names, including Shechem therefore, mean nothing other than real things becomes quite clear from these prophetic utterances of David Otherwise 
they would be scarcely more than a heap of names. References to Shechem becoming a city of refuge, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%2020:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 20:7</a>, and also a priestly city, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%2021:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 21:21</a>, and a place where the covenant was made, Josh. 
24:1, <a href="25.htm">25</a>, also embody the same.

Quod haec significentur per 'Shechem,' constare quoque potest ex eo quod Shechem sit prima quasi statio in terra Canaane quo pervenitur a Syria seu a Harane; et quia per 'terram Canaanem' significatur 
caelestia amoris, constat quod per 'Shechemum' significetur prima apparitio caelestium; Jacobus cum ex Harane in terram Canaanem rediit, pariter ad Shechemum venit, ut ex his constare potest, Jacob 
profectus est in Succoth, et aedificavit sibi domum, et pecori suo fecit tentoria, ideo vocavit nomen loci Succoth; et venit Jacob Shalem, urbem Shechemi, quae in terra Canaan, cum venit ille ex Padan 
Aram, et castrametatus est ante urbem,... 	et erexit ibi altare, Gen. xxxiii 17-20; </p>
<p>ubi quoque per 'Shechem' primum lucis significatur:  apud Davidem, Deus locutus est in sanctitate Sua; Exsultabo, 
partiar Shechemum, et vallem Succoth dimetiar.  Mihi Gilead et Mihi Menasseh; et Ephraim robur capitis Mei, Jehudah legislator Meus. Moabus pelvis lotionis Meae, super Edomum mittam calceum Meum, 
super Philistaea clangam, Ps. lx 8-10 [A.V. 6-8]; cviii 8-10 [A.V. 7-9]; </p>
<p>ubi per 'Shechemum' quoque simile quid significatur:  quod nomina nihil aliud significent quam res, ita etiam Shechem, manifeste 
ex his Davidis propheticis constare potest, alioquin vix nisi nominum congeries forent.  Quod Shechem facta urbs refugii, Jos. xx 7, et quoque urbs sacerdotum, Jos. xxi 21, et quod ibi foedus, Jos. 
xxiv 1, 25, simile etiam involvit. </p>
