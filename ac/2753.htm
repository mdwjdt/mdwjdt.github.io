<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2753节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2753.</strong>在世上有些男人被引诱处女行淫的欲望所牵引，无论在什么地方（无论在修道院，家里，还是与父母生活的地方），还引诱有夫之妇；他们用诡计和奉承钻进来。由于他们已习惯于这类勾当，并由此形成自己的本性，故在来世，他们仍保留这种通过奉承和伪装钻进各个社群的能力。不过，由于其思维是敞开的，故他们遭到拒绝。于是，他们从一个社群转到另一个社群，但到处被拒绝。他们还受到惩罚，因为他们试图窃取别人的幸福快乐。最终，他们不再获准进入任何社群，在受到严厉惩罚后，他们便被带到地狱的同类那里去了。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2753</b></p><p><b>2753.</b>
There are some in the world who are carried away by the lust of seducing virgins to whoredom, wherever they may be: in nunneries, in families, or with their parents, and also wives; and they insinuate 
themselves by crafty modes and with flatteries. As they are accustomed to such things, and have formed their nature from them, they retain in the other life the ability to insinuate themselves into 
societies by flatteries and simulations; but as their thoughts lie plainly open, they are rejected. They thus pass from one society to another, but are everywhere rejected: they are also treated with 
severity, for they study to steal away the delights and blessedness of others. At length they are admitted into no societies, but after having endured severe punishments, are associated with their like in hell. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2753</b></p><p><b>2753.</b>
There are certain men in the world who are carried away by the desire to lure virgins into whoredom, wherever these may be - in convents, in families, living with parents - and to lure wives also, using 
crafty methods and flattery to worm their way in. And because they have become accustomed to such goings on, and have therefore acquired such a disposition, they retain in the next life their ability 
to worm their way into social groups by means of flattery and presence. But because their thoughts lie open to view they are turned away. They thus pass from one social group to another, but wherever 
they go they are turned away. They are also subjected to chastisement, for they endeavour to steal other people's forms of delight and blessedness. At length they do not gain admittance into any such 
groups, but after being severely punished they are then brought into association with others like themselves in hell. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2753</b>
</p><b>2753.</b>
Sunt quidam in mundo qui cupiditate feruntur pellicere virgines ad scortationes, ubicumque loci sint, in monasteriis, in familiis, apud parentes, etiam uxores, et se insinuant astutis modis et blanditiis; 
ii quia talibus assuefacti, et inde naturam imbuerunt, in altera vita retinent quod in societates se insinuare possint per blanda et simulata, sed quia cogitata eorum patent, rejiciuntur; transeunt 
sic ab una societate ad alteram, sed ubivis rejiciuntur, etiam mulctantur, surripere enim jucunda et beata aliorum student; tandem in nullas societates admittuntur, sed postquam graves poenas sustinuerunt, 
associantur similibus in inferno. </p>
