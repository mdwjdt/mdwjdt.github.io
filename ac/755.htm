<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第755节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>755.</strong>从目前所述可以推知，“当挪亚活了六百岁那一年，二月十七日那一天”表试探的第二状态。因为从第6节到第11节一直在阐述试探的最初状态，也就是涉及觉知之物的状态。现在阐述的是第二状态，即涉及意愿之物的试探。这就是为何重复他的年龄的原因。前面说他是“六百岁的儿子”，这里说在他“活了六百岁那一年，二月十七日那一天”，大洪水来袭。没人会想到，被精确到年、月、日的挪亚的年龄表示涉及意愿之物的试探的状态。但如前所述，这就是上古之人言说和写作的风格。他们的最大乐趣就在于能指定时间与名字，由此构筑类似真实历史的叙事。他们的智慧就在于此。<br />②前面说过（7:6），“六百岁”无非表示试探的最初状态，这里同样提到了“六百岁”。不过，为了使它可以表示试探的第二状态，就加上了“月”和“日”。实际上，两个月或“二月”均表示争战本身，这一点从本章第二节的解读中数字“2”的含义明显可知，那里说明了它和“6”有相同的含义，都表示劳碌、争战，以及驱散。但数字“17”既表试探的开始，也表试探的结束，因为它是数字7和10的和。当这个数字表示试探的开始时，它牵涉“七天”或七期（a week of seven days）。前面说过（7:4），“七天”（或七期）表示试探的开始。但当它表示试探的结束（如8:4）时，七就是一个神圣的数字，于是加上了表示余留的十，因为没有余留，人无法重生。<br />③十七表试探的开始，这一点可清楚见于耶利米书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶32.9.htm">32:9</a>），耶利米被吩咐向住在亚拿突的堂兄哈拿篾买了块地，平了十七舍客勒银子给他。该章接下来的经文表明，这个数字也表巴比伦的囚禁，巴比伦的囚禁象征有信之人的试探和无信之人的毁灭。事实上，它还表试探的开始，同时表试探的结束，即释放。耶利米书提到了囚禁（32:36），还提到了释放（32:37等）。这种数字若不象所有其它话那样涉及隐藏的含义，它决不会出现在这先知书中。<br />④十七表试探的开始，这一点还可从约瑟的年龄清楚可知。他被打发到他哥哥那里，并被卖到埃及时，正好十七岁（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创37.2.htm">37:2</a>）。他被卖到埃及象征同样的事，蒙主慈悲，这一点将在那一章予以说明。那里的代表性历史事件照所描述的真实发生了，但这里的历史事件是虚构的，具有属灵之义，并未照着字义所描述的那样真实发生。然而，前者涉及天堂的奥秘，甚至每一句话都是如此，和此处虚构的历史一样。这一事实不免显得奇怪，因为当有历史事件出现时，头脑就会局限于文字，并且无法从中脱离，因此认为这些历史事件并非表示和象征其它事。<br />⑤然而，凡有悟性者都能清楚看出，拥有圣言生命的某种内义就存在于其中，但并不存在于文字中，缺乏内义的文字是死的。若无内义，圣言中的历史叙事和世俗作者所讲述的历史有何区别？若不涉及天堂的奥秘，当大洪水来袭时，知道挪亚的准确年龄，或月份、日子又有什么用？谁看不出“大深渊的泉源都裂开了，天上的水闸也敞开了”是一句预言？更不用说其它类似考虑了。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]755.</strong> The symbolism of the six hundredth year, second month, and seventeenth day as the next stage of their trials follows from what has been said so far. From verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_755/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_6" target=_top>6</a> up to this point, verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_755/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_11" target=_top>11</a>, the text has dealt with the first stage of trial, which was a challenge to the concerns of the intellect, but the present passage deals with the next stage, a challenge to the concerns of the will. This is the reason for the restatement of Noah's age. It is expressed the first time as the fact that he was a son of six hundred years but here as the fact that the Flood took place in the six hundredth year of his life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day.<br />No one can possibly guess that the years of Noah's life, specified down to the year, month, and day, mean a condition of struggle in respect to the promptings of the will, but this was the way the earliest people spoke and wrote, as noted [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_755/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_66" target=_top>66</a>]. They took particular delight in being able to specify periods and names in order to construct an authentic-sounding history. This is what their wisdom consisted in.<br />[2] I have already shown, at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_755/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_6" target=_top>6</a> above [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_755/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_737" target=_top>737</a>], that six hundred years simply symbolize the first stage of trial. The six hundred years here have a similar meaning, but the months and days are added in order to symbolize the second stage. In fact, two months (or in the second month) is added, symbolizing the actual combat, as can be seen from the symbolism of the number two, given above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_755/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_2" target=_top>2</a> of this chapter. It was shown to have the same symbolism as six: hard work, combat, and dispersing something. (See the demonstration there.){*1} The number seventeen, however, symbolizes both the beginning and the end of trial, because it is composed of seven and ten. When seven symbolizes the beginning of trial, it implies the phrase in seven days, or a seven-day week, which was shown above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_755/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_4" target=_top>4</a> of this chapter [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_755/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_728" target=_top>728</a>] to symbolize the beginning of trial. But when seven symbolizes the end of trial, as it does below in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_755/bible_king-james-version_genesis_8_4" target=_top>Genesis 8:4</a>, it is a holy number. Ten, symbolizing the things that remain, is added to the seven because without a remnant we cannot be reborn.<br />[3] The symbolism of seventeen as the beginning of trial can be seen in Jeremiah, where he was commanded to buy a field in Anathoth from Hanamel, his father's brother. Jeremiah weighed out silver for him, seventeen shekels of silver (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_755/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_32_9" target=_top>Jeremiah 32:9</a>). This number also symbolized the people's captivity in Babylon, which represented the trials suffered by the faithful and the devastation suffered by the faithless. In fact it represented the start of trial and at the same time the end of trial, or liberation. All this can be seen from later verses in the same chapter of Jeremiah: verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_755/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_32_36" target=_top>36</a> concerns their captivity, and the next, verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_755/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_32_37" target=_top>37</a>, their liberation. A number like this would never have shown up in Jeremiah had it not, like all the other details, entailed secrets from heaven.<br />[4] The symbolism of seventeen as the start of trial can also be seen from Joseph's age — he was a "son of seventeen years" — when he was sent to his brothers and sold into Egypt (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_755/bible_king-james-version_genesis_37_2" target=_top>Genesis 37:2</a>). The fact that he was sold into Egypt has a similar representation, as will be demonstrated in the appropriate place [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_755/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4670" target=_top>4670</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_755/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4788" target=_top>4788</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_755/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5886" target=_top>5886</a>], with the Lord's divine mercy.<br />That passage in Genesis contains historical details with a representative meaning, and events happened according to the description there. The events of the current passage, though, are made-up history with a symbolic meaning and did not happen according to the literal description here. Yet the components of Joseph's story down to the individual words still involve heavenly secrets as much as those of Noah's story do.<br />This fact necessarily seems strange, because anywhere that an item of true or made-up history occurs, the mind lingers over the literal meaning, unable to extricate itself, and it therefore believes no symbolism or representation exists beyond the letter.<br />[5] But any intelligent person can see that the Word has some kind of inner meaning in which its life resides. (Its life is not in the letter, which apart from the inner meaning is dead.) Without a deeper meaning, how does a historical fact [in the Word] differ from one reported by any secular author? What use would it be to know in what year, month, and day of Noah's life the Flood took place, if this did not involve some heavenly mystery? Can anyone fail to see that all the springs of the great abyss burst and heaven's floodgates opened is a prophetic turn of speech? Other similar arguments could be offered.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The equivalence of two and six is explained at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_755/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_2" target=_top>2</a> (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_755/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_720" target=_top>720</a>); the actual meaning of six is treated more fully at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_755/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_6" target=_top>6</a> (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_755/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_737" target=_top>737</a>).

That by "the six hundredth year, the second month, and seventeenth day" is signified the second state of temptation, follows from what has hitherto been said; for from the sixth verse to this eleventh 
verse the first state of temptation is treated of, which was temptation as to things of his understanding. And that now the second state is treated of, namely, as to things of the will, is the reason 
why his age is told again. It was said before that he was "a son of six hundred years" and here that the flood came "in the six-hundredth year of his life, in the second month, and in the seventeenth 
day." No one could suppose that by the years of Noah's age, of which the years, months, and days are specified, a state of temptation as to things of the will is meant. But as has been said, such was 
the manner of speech and of writing among the most ancient people; and especially were they delighted in being able to specify times and names, and thereby construct a narrative similar to actual history; 
and in this consisted their wisdom.  [2] Now it has been shown above, at verse 6, that the "six hundred years" signify nothing else than the first state of temptation, and so do the "six hundred 
years" here; but in order that the second state of temptation might be signified, "months" and "days" are added; and indeed two months or "in the second month" which signifies combat itself, as is 
evident from the signification of the number "two" in the second verse of this chapter, where it is shown that it signifies the same as "six" that is, labor and combat, and also dispersion. But the number 
"seventeen" signifies both the beginning of temptation and the end of temptation, because it is composed of the numbers seven and ten. When this number signifies the beginning of temptation, it involves 
the days up to seven, or a week of seven days; and that this signifies the beginning of temptation has been shown above, at the fourth verse of this chapter. But when it signifies the end of temptation 
(as at verse 4 of chapter 8), then "seven" is a holy number; to which "ten" (which signifies remains) is adjoined, for without remains man cannot be regenerated.  [3] That the number "seventeen" 
signifies the beginning of temptation, is evident in Jeremiah, when that prophet was commanded to buy a field from Hanamel his uncle's son, which was in Anathoth; and he weighed him the money, seventeen 
shekels of silver (Jer. 32:9). That this number also signifies the Babylonish captivity, which represents the temptation of the faithful and the devastation of the unfaithful, and so the beginning 
of temptation and at the same time the end of temptation, or liberation, is evident from what follows in the same chapter-the captivity in the thirty-sixth verse, and the liberation in the thirty-seventh 
and following verses. No such number would have appeared in the prophecy if it had not, like all the other words, involved a hidden meaning.  [4] That "seventeen" signifies the beginning of 
temptation, is also evident from the age of Joseph, who was a "son of seventeen years" when he was sent to his brothers and sold into Egypt (Gen. 37:2). His being sold into Egypt has a similar signification, 
as of the Lord's Divine mercy will be shown in the explication of that chapter. There the historical events are representative, which actually took place as described; but here significative 
historical incidents are composed, which did not take place as described in the sense of the letter. And yet the actual events involve arcana of heaven, in fact every word of them does so, exactly as 
do these made-up histories. It cannot but appear strange that this is so, because where any historical fact or statement is presented, the mind is held in the letter and cannot release itself from it, 
and so thinks that nothing else is signified and represented.  [5] But that there is an internal sense in which the life of the Word resides (and not in the letter, which without the internal sense 
is dead), must be evident to every intelligent man. Without the internal sense how does any historical statement in the Word differ from history as told by any profane writer? And then of what use would 
it be to know the age of Noah, and the month and day when the flood took place, if it did not involve a heavenly arcanum? And who cannot see that this saying: "all the fountains of the great deep were 
broken up, and the cataracts of heaven were opened" is a prophetical one? Not to mention other like considerations. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 755</b></p><p><b>755.</b>
That 'the six hundredth year, the second month, and the seventeenth day' means the second state of temptation follows from what has been stated so far, for verse 6 down to this present verse 11 has dealt 
with the first state of temptation, which was temptation involving things of his understanding. Now however the second state is dealt with, namely temptation involving things of the will. This is 
the reason why his age is repeated. Previously it was said that 'he was a son of six hundred years', here that the Flood took place in 'the six hundredth year of his life, in the second month, on the 
seventeenth day'. No one would ever imagine that Noah's age, worked out to the exact year, month, and day, is used to mean a state of temptation involving things of the will. Yet, as has been stated, 
this was how the most ancient people spoke and wrote. And they found their chief delight in being able to work out periods of time and names and then to organize them into a semblance of history. It 
was in this that their wisdom consisted. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It was shown at verse 6 above however that 'six hundred years' means nothing other than an initial state of temptation. Here similarly 'six hundred years' 
is mentioned. But so that it might mean a second state of temptation, months and days have been added - two months in fact, or rather 'in the second month', which means conflict itself, as becomes 
clear from the meaning of the number two given already at verse 6 of this chapter. As has been shown and may be seen there, two has the same meaning as six, that is, labour and conflict and also dispersion. 
The number seventeen however means not only the onset of temptation but also the end of temptation, the reason being that it is the sum of the numbers seven and ten. When this number means the 
onset of temptation it then entails 'seven days' or a week, which means the onset of temptation, as shown already at verse 4 of this chapter. But when it means the end of temptation, as it does later 
on in 8:4, seven is then a holy number to which ten, meaning remnants, has been added; for without remnants nobody is able to be regenerated.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That seventeen means the onset of temptation is clear 
in Jeremiah's being commanded to buy the field from Hanamel his cousin who was in Anathoth, and to weigh out seventeen shekels of silver, Jer. 32:9. What comes after that in this chapter of the prophet 
shows that this number also means their captivity in Babylon, which represents the temptation of people who have faith and the devastation of those who have not. Indeed it represents the onset of 
temptation and at the same time the end of temptation, which is liberation. That captivity is mentioned in Jer. 32:36, and the liberation in verse 37 onwards. Such a number, like every other word that 
is used, would never have appeared in this prophet if it did not embody arcana.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 That seventeen means the onset of temptation becomes clear also from the age of Joseph, who was seventeen years 
old when he was sent off to his brothers and was sold into Egypt, Gen. 37:2. His being sold into Egypt represents the same kinds of things, as will in the Lord's Divine mercy be shown in that chapter. 
There the representative historical events did take place as described; here however they are made-up historical events carrying a spiritual meaning, which did not actually take place as described 
in the sense of the letter. Nevertheless the former embody arcana of heaven, right down to every word, as is the case here. This is bound to seem strange, for when any historical event occurs, true or 
made-up, the mind (animus) is confined to the letter from which it cannot extricate itself. Hence the conviction that nothing else is meant or represented. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Yet it may become clear to anyone who 
is intelligent that some internal sense exists which has the life of the Word in it, but not in the letter, which devoid of the internal sense is dead. Without the internal sense what would any historical 
description be but history as found in any secular author? And so what would be the use of knowing Noah's exact age, or the month and day when the Flood took place, if it did not embody a heavenly 
arcanum? And who cannot see that 'all the fountains of the great deep were split open, and the floodgates of heaven were opened' is a prophetic utterance, as is much else besides?  </p>

Quod per 'annum sexcentesimum, mensem secundum, et diem decimum septimum' significetur alter status tentationis, sequitur ex illis quae hactenus dicta sunt, nam a vers. 6 ad hunc 11 actum est de primo 
statu tentationis, qui fuit quoad ejus intellectualia, nunc autem agitur de altero statu, nempe quoad voluntaria, quae causa est quod iterum dicatur aetas ejus, prius quod 'fuerit filius sexcentorum

et inde historiam vero similem concinnare; in eo sapientia eorum constabat. Quod autem 'sexcenti anni' non significent aliud quam statum tentationis primum, ostensum est supra ad vers. 6; hic similiter 
'anni sexcenti,' sed ut alter status tentationis significaretur, additi sunt menses et dies, et quidem menses duo, seu 'in mense secundo,' qui significant ipsam pugnam, ut constare potest a significatione 
numeri 'duo' prius ad vers. 2 hujus capitis, nempe quod significent idem ac sex, hoc est, laborem et pugnam, tum dispersionem, ut ibi ostensum videatur. Numerus autem 'septendecim' significat 
tam principium tentationis quam finem tentationis, ex causa quia compositus est ex numero septenario et decem; qui numerus cum significat principium tentationis tunc involvit 'ad dies septem,' seu 
septimanam septem dierum, quae quod significet principium tentationis, prius ad vers. 4 hujus capitis ostensum est; at cum significat finem tentationis, ut cap. seq. viii vers. 4, tunc 'septem' est

Babylonicam, per quam repraesentatur tentatio fidelium et devastatio infidelium, et quidem principium tentationis et simul finis tentationis, seu liberatio, constare potest a sequentibus in capite 
illo apud Prophetam; quod captivitas ad vers. 36 ibi, quod liberatio a vers. 37 seq. ibi; talis numerus nusquam apud Prophetam exstaret nisi arcana, sicut omnia reliqua, involveret.  Quod 'septendecim' 
significent principium tentationis, etiam constare potest ab aetate Josephi, qui septendecim annorum filius erat cum missus ad fratres et venditus in Aegyptum, Gen. xxxvii 2; 'quod venditus in Aegyptum'

se non ita habent sicut describuntur in sensu litterae; sed usque illa involvunt arcana caeli, et quidem unaquaevis vox, sicut haec: quod ita se habeant, non potest non peregrinum apparere, quia ubi 
aliquod historicum verum aut historicum factum occurrit, animus detinetur in littera, e qua se abstrahere nequit; inde credit quod nihil aliud significet et repraesentet; sed quod internus aliquis 
sensus sit, in quo vita Verbi, non autem in littera, quae absque sensu interno mortua est, unicuique intelligenti constare potest; absque sensu interno quid historicum aliud est quam historicum apud aliquem 
profanum scriptorem? ita quid utilitatis foret scire annum Noahi, et mensem et diem, cum diluvium factum, nisi arcanum caeleste involvat? et quis non potest videre quod 'omnes fontes abyssi magnae 
disrupti, et cataractae caeli apertae' sit locutio prophetica? praeter alia similia.   1 I has siclorum, probably a printer's misreading. </p>
