<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7560节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7560.</strong>“不收回家”表凡未妥善保管的。这从“不收回家”的含义清楚可知，“不收回家”是指未妥善保管。因为“家”表示良善和真理所住的内层属世心智，以及理性心智，因而这个人自己（<a href="3538.htm">3538</a>，<a href="4973.htm">4973</a>，<a href="5023.htm">5023</a>，<a href="7353.htm">7353</a>节）。因此，“收回家”是指收集在里面，在那里储存起来。主将良善和真理储存在里面，并在那里妥善保管，甚至在恶人里面也是这样，是为了叫使得他们成为人的某种事物仍能保留下来；因为没有良善和真理，没有人真正是一个人。事实上，被储存起来并妥善保管的，是良善和真理。人通过它们与天堂交流；人在何等程度上拥有与天堂的交流，就在何等程度上是一个人。诚然，恶人，包括地狱里的人，也与天堂交流，但绝不会通过良善和真理与它联结。因为良善和真理一从天堂流下来并进入地狱，就被转变成邪恶和虚假，结合立刻被打破。这就是他们的交流是什么样子。不过，尽管联结通过被储存起来并妥善保管在内层中的良善和真理而存在；然而，储存在恶人的内层里面的真理和良善不会产生任何效果，只能使他们在感官层面进行推理、思考，进而谈论，由此证实虚假，保卫邪恶。再没有更多东西能从储存并妥善保管在他们里面的良善和真理中被释放出来，因为若真有更多东西被释放出来，真理和良善就会被毁，因而恶人里面剩不下丝毫人性之物。</p>

And shall not be brought to the house. That this signifies which is not reserved, is evident from the signification of "not being brought to the house," as being not to be reserved; for the "house" denotes 
the interior natural mind where good is with truth, and also the rational mind, and thus the man himself (n. 3538, 4973, 5023, 7353); hence "to be brought to the house" denotes to be collected 
within, and there stored up. Good and truth are stored up within, and are there reserved by the Lord, even with the evil, in order that there may still be something human left; for man without these is 
not man, because the things stored up and reserved are good and truth, and by these man has communication with heaven; and insofar as man has communication with heaven, so far he is man. There is indeed 
a communication with heaven of the evil, even of those who are in hell, but no conjunction by good and truth; for as soon as good and truth flow down from heaven and come into hell, they are turned 
into evil and falsity, whence the conjunction is at once broken. Such is the communication. But although there is conjunction through the good and truth which are stored up and reserved in the interiors; 
yet the truths and goods in the interiors of those who are evil effect nothing more than to enable them to reason, and to think and speak from the sensuous, thus to confirm what is false and defend 
what is evil. Nothing more can be let out from the goods and truths stored up and reserved within them, for if more were let out, the truths and goods would perish, and thus nothing human would be 
left in them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7560</b></p><p><b>7560.</b>
'And will not be gathered home' means which is not in safe keeping. This is clear from the meaning of 'not being gathered home' as not being placed in safe keeping. For 'home' or 'house' is the inner 
part of the natural mind where goodness and truth reside, and it is also the rational mind, and so where the real person is, dealt with in <a href="3578.htm">3578</a>, <a href="4973.htm">4973</a>, <a href="5023.htm">5023</a>, <a href="7353.htm">7353</a>. Therefore 'being gathered home' is being 
gathered to an inward position and stored away there. Goodness and truth are stored away inwardly and placed in safe keeping there by the Lord, even in the evil, in order that something of what makes 
them human may still remain; for without goodness and truth nobody is truly a human being. What are stored away and placed in safe keeping are indeed goodness and truth. Through them communication 
is effected with heaven; and to the extent that a person is in communication with heaven he is a human being. The evil, including those in hell, are - it is true - in communication with heaven; but 
they are in no way linked to it through goodness and truth. For the moment that goodness and truth flow down from heaven and enter hell they are turned into evil and falsity, and the link is instantly 
broken. This is what their communication is like. But through the goodness and truth stored away and placed in safe keeping interiorly a link does exist. With the evil however the truths and forms of 
good stored away there do no more than enable them to engage in reasoning, think and consequently speak on a sensory level, and thereby substantiate falsity and defend evil. Of all the goodness and truth 
that have been stored away and placed in safe keeping within them, no more than this can be released; for if more were released the truths and forms of good would be destroyed and so the evil would 
be left with nothing human at all. </p>

`Et non colligetur domum': quod significet quod non reservatur, constat ex significatione `non colligi domum' quod sit non reservari, `domus' enim est mens interior naturalis ubi bonum {1}cum vero, 
tum quoque est mens rationalis, ac ita ipse homo, de qua n. 3538, 4973, 5023, 7353; inde `colligi domum' est colligi {2}intro et ibi recondi.  Quod bonum et verum recondantur intus, et {3}ibi reserventur 
a Domino, etiam apud malos, est ut usque aliquid humani residuum sit; homo enim absque illis non est homo, {4}quae enim reconduntur et reservantur sunt bonum et verum; per haec communicatio est cum 
caelo; et quantum communicationis homo habet cum caelo, tantum est homo; est quidem communicatio malorum, {5}etiam qui in inferno sunt cum caelo, sed non aliqua conjunctio per bonum et verum, nam ilico 
ut bonum et verum defluunt e caelo, et veniunt in infernum, vertuntur illa in malum et falsum, inde actutum dirumpitur conjunctio; talis communicatio est; at per bonum et verum quae reconduntur et 
reservantur in interioribus est conjunctio; sed {6}vera et bona ibi apud malos non plus efficiunt quam ut possint ratiocinari et ex sensuali cogitare et inde loqui et sic confirmare falsum et defendere 
malum; plus non ex {7}bonis et veris apud illos reconditis et reservatis (x)emitti potest, nam si plus emitteretur, {8}perirent vera et bona, et sic nihil humani illis superesset. 	@1 et verum$ 	@2
