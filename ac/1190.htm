<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1190节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1190.</strong> “尼尼微、迦拉中间的利鲜”表他们还为自己制定生活的教义，“利鲜”表教义所包含的衍生虚假。这从刚才有关尼尼微和迦拉，以及上下文的连贯性清楚可知，因为前一节论述教义的虚假，本节论述生活的虚假。这是圣言的风格，尤其是预言的风格，因为当论述理解力之物时，圣言也会论述意愿之物。前一节论述理解力之物，或教义的虚假；而本节论述生活的虚假，也就是“利鲜”所表示的。由于圣言没有再提及利鲜，所以这个问题不大那么容易得以证实，除了通过以下事实，即利鲜被建在尼尼微和迦拉之间，即在理论的虚假和产生虚假生活的恶欲的虚假之间；还有它被称为“大城”的事实，因为所有这一切都来自理解力的虚假和意愿的虚假。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1190.</strong> Resen, between Nineveh and Calah, means that they also created doctrines for themselves about how to live, and Resen symbolizes the false doctrines that resulted. This is established by the evidence given directly above concerning Nineveh and Calah. It is also established by the logical progression: The last verse [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1190/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1188" target=_top>1188</a>] spoke of falsity in doctrine; the present one, of falsity in a person's life. The writing mode of the Word, especially in the prophets, requires that matters of the will be addressed whenever matters of intellect are. The last verse talked about something intellectual — falsity in doctrine — but the present one talks about the falsity we live by, which is what Resen symbolizes. Since the Word does not mention Resen anywhere else, the meaning cannot really be proved, except by two pieces of evidence. One is the fact that Resen was built between Nineveh and Calah, or in other words, between the falsity that comes of faulty reasoning and the falsity that comes of our cravings — a combination producing falsity that we actually live by. The other is the fact that it is called the great city because it rises out of falsity in both the intellect and the will. </p>

And Resen, between Nineveh and Calah. That this signifies that they also formed for themselves doctrinals of life; and that the false doctrinals thence derived are signified by "Resen," may be seen from 
what has just been shown respecting Nineveh and Calah; and also from the connection, in that in the preceding verse falsities of doctrine, and here falsities of life are treated of. For such is the 
style of the Word, especially the prophetical style, that when it treats of things of the understanding it treats also of those of the will. In the preceding verse things of the understanding, or falsities 
of doctrine, are treated of; but here falsities of life, which are signified by "Resen." As no further mention is made of Resen in the Word, this cannot so well be confirmed, except from the fact 
of Resen's being built between Nineveh and Calah, that is, between falsity from reasonings and falsity from cupidities, which produces falsity of life; and from its being called the "great city," 
because it is from falsities both of the understanding and of the will. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1190</b></p><p><b>1190.</b>
'Resen between Nineveh and Calah' means that they also formulated for themselves doctrinal teachings concerning life -'Resen' means derivative falsities contained in doctrinal teachings. This becomes 
clear from what has just been shown concerning Nineveh and Calah, and also from the train of thought, in that the previous verse dealt with falsities of doctrine, the present verse with falsities of 
life. For the style of the Word is such, especially the prophetical style, that when matters of the understanding are dealt with, those of the will are dealt with as well. The previous verse dealt with 
those of the understanding, that is, with falsities of doctrine, whereas the present verse deals with falsities of life, meant by 'Resen'. As no further mention is made of 'Resen' in the Word this matter 
cannot so easily be confirmed, except from the fact that 'Resen was built between Nineveh and Calah' - that is, between falsity arising from reasonings and falsity arising from evil desires which 
produces falsity of life- and also from the fact that it is called 'a great city' since all this is the product of falsities both of the understanding and of the will. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1190</b>
</p><b>1190.</b>
Quod 'Resen inter Niniven et Calah' significet quod quoque formaverint sibi doctrinalia vitae, et quod per 'Resen' significentur doctrinalia falsa inde, constare ex illis quae mox prius de Ninive et 
Calah ostensa sunt; tum a serie rerum, quod in versu priore actum sit de falsis doctrinae, hic nunc de falsis vitae; nam stilus Verbi talis est, imprimis propheticus, quod cum de intellectualibus, etiam 
de voluntariis agatur; in versu priore de intellectualibus seu falsis doctrinae, hic autem de falsis vitae, quae per 'Resen' significantur cujus quia mentio non fit amplius in Verbo, non ita confirmari 
potest, solum ex eo quod 'aedificata sit Resen inter Niniven et Calah,' hoc est, inter falsum ex ratiociniis, et falsum a cupiditatibus quod producit falsum vitae; tum ex eo quod vocetur 'urbs magna,' 
quia ex falsis tam intellectus quam voluntatis. </p>
