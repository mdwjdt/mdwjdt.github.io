<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3814节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3814.</strong>“雅各就和他同住了一个月”表生活的新状态。这从“住”和“月”的含义清楚可知：“住”是指生活（参看<a href="1293.htm">1293</a>，<a href="3384.htm">3384</a>，<a href="3613.htm">3613</a>节）；“一个月”是指一个新状态。所有时间都表示状态（参看<a href="1274.htm">1274</a>，<a href="1382.htm">1382</a>，<a href="2625.htm">2625</a>，<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="2837.htm">2837</a>，<a href="3254.htm">3254</a>，<a href="3356.htm">3356</a>，<a href="3404.htm">3404</a>节），因此年、月、日都表示状态。至于表示哪种状态，这从它们的确切数字明显可知。不过，当年、月或日以单数被提及时，它表示整个状态，因而表示前一个状态的结束和下一个状态的开始，这一点在各处的解释已经说明。故此处“月”表示前一个状态的结束和下一个状态的开始，因而表示一个新状态，这在圣言的其它部分也一样。如以赛亚书：<br />每逢月朔、安息日，凡有血气的必来在我面前下拜。这是耶和华说的。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛66.23.htm">66:23</a>）<br />启示录：<br />他又指示我一道纯净的生命水的河，明亮如水晶，从神和羔羊的宝座流出来。在城内街道当中，就是河这边与那边有生命树，结十二样果子，每月都结果子。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.1.htm">22:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.2.htm">2</a>）<br />“每月都结果子”表在接受并随之实践良善方面永远有新的状态。<br />摩西五经：<br />你要照利未人父系的家室、宗族数点他们。凡一个月和以外的男子都要数点。你要从以色列人中数点一个月和以外凡头生的男子，把他们的名字记下。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民3.15.htm">3:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民3.40.htm">40</a>）<br />正因为“月”表示前一个状态的结束和下一个状态（即一个新的状态）的开始，故经上吩咐要数点“一个月和以外”的人。<br />若在被掳的人中见有形体美貌的女子，恋慕她，要娶她为妻，她要脱去被掳时所穿的衣服，住在你家里哀哭父母一个整月，然后可以进去与她同房；她作你的妻子。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申21.11.htm">21:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申21.13.htm">13</a>）<br />此处“一个整月”明显表示前一个状态的结束和下一个或新的状态的开始。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3814</b></p><p><b>3814.</b>
And he dwelt with him a month of days. That this signifies a new state of life, is evident from the signification of "dwelling," as being life (see n. 1293, 3384, 3613); and from the signification of 
a "month of days," as being a new state. (That all "times" denote states, see above, n. 1274, 1382, 2625, 2788, 2837, 3254, 3356, 3404; and therefore so do "years," "months," and "days;" but the quality 
of the states signified is evident from the numbers affixed.) But when a "year," "month," or "day" is mentioned in the singular number, it signifies an entire state; thus the end of the preceding 
and the beginning of the subsequent state, as has been shown above throughout the explications. Here therefore by a "month" is signified the end of the preceding and the beginning of the subsequent state, 
thus a new state, as also in other parts of the Word. As in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     At last it shall come to pass from month to its month, and from sabbath to sabbath, all flesh shall come to bow themselves 
down before Me, saith Jehovah (Isa. 66:23). In John: </p>
<p>     He showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, going forth from the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the midst of the street 
of it, and of the river, on this side and on that, was the tree of life, bearing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit every month (Rev. 22:1-2); </p>
<p>"yielding its fruit every month" signifies a state ever 
new, in regard to the reception of good, and the practice thence resulting. [2] In Moses: </p>
<p>     Number the sons of Levi by their fathers' house and by their families, every male from a month old and 
upward thou shalt number them. Number every firstborn male of the sons of Israel, from the son of a month and upward, and take the number of their names (Num. 3:15, 40); </p>
<p>it was because the end of a 
preceding and the beginning of a subsequent state (that is, a new state), was signified by a "month," that it was commanded that their numbering should be "from the son of a month and upward." Again: </p>
<p> 
    If thou seest among the captives a woman beautiful in form, and thou hast a desire unto her, and wouldest take her to thee to wife, she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and 
shall sit in thy house, and bewail her father and her mother a month of days, and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and shalt know her; and she shall be unto thee for a wife (Deut. 21:11, 13); </p>
<p>where 
a "month of days" plainly denotes the end of a preceding, and the beginning of a subsequent or new state. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3814</b></p><p><b>3814.</b>
'And he dwelt with him for a full month' means a new state of life. This is clear from the meaning of 'dwelling' as life, dealt with in <a href="1293.htm">1293</a>, <a href="3384.htm">3384</a>, <a href="3613.htm">3613</a>, and from the meaning of 'a full month' as a new 
state. All periods of time mean states, see <a href="1274.htm">1274</a>, <a href="1382.htm">1382</a>, <a href="2625.htm">2625</a>, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="2837.htm">2837</a>, <a href="3254.htm">3254</a>, <a href="3356.htm">3356</a>, <a href="3404.htm">3404</a>, so that years, months, and days mean such. What kind of states are meant however is clear from the numbers 
attached to them. When however year, month, or day is used in the singular, an entire state is meant, and so the end of the previous state and the beginning of the next, as has also been shown in various 
places in the explanations. Here therefore 'month' means the end of the previous state and the beginning of the next, and so means a new state, as in other places in the Word, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
At 
length from month to its month, and from sabbath to sabbath, all flesh will come to bow down before Me, said Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2066:23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 66:23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In John, </p>
<blockquote>
He showed me a pure river of the water of life, bright 
as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the middle of its street, and of the river, on this side and on that, was the tree of life bearing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each 
month. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2022:1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 22:1, 2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Yielding its fruit each month' stands for a state for ever new as regards the reception of good and the consequent practice of it. In Moses, Count the sons of Levi according 
to their father's house and according to their families. Every male a month old and over shall you count. Count every firstborn male of the children of Israel, a month old and over, and take the number 
of their names. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%203:15,40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 3:15,40</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It was because the end of the previous state and the beginning of the next, that is, a new state, was meant by 'a month' that they were ordered to count those 
who were 'a month old and over'. In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
If you see among captives a beautiful woman, and have a desire for her so that you would take her to yourself for a wife, she shall remove the clothing 
of her captivity from upon her, and she shall sit in your house and lament her father and her mother for a full month. After that you shall go in to her and know her, and she shall be your wife. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2021:11,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 21:11, 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'a full month' clearly stands for the end of the previous and the beginning of the next or new state. </p>

`Et habitavit cum eo mensem dierum':  quod significet vitae statum novum, constat a significatione `habitare' quod sit vita, de qua n. 1293, 3384, 3613; et ex significatione `mensis dierum' quod sit 
status novus; quod omnia tempora sint status, videatur n. 1274, 1382, 2625, 2788, 2837, 3254, 3356, 3404, ita anni, menses et dies;  quales autem status significent, constat ex numeris (c)eis appositis; 
cum autem in singulari dicitur annus, mensis aut dies, significatur integer status, ita finis prioris et principium sequentis, ut quoque in explicationibus passim ostensum; hic itaque per 
`mensem' finis prioris status et principium sequentis, ita status novus; ut quoque alibi in Verbo, ut apud Esaiam,      Tandem fiet de mense in mensem suum, et de sabbato in       sabbatum, veniet 
omnis caro ad incurvandum se coram Me,  dixit      Jehovah, lxvi 23: </p>
<p>apud Johannem,      Ostendit mihi purum fluvium aquae vitae, splendidum  sicut      crystallum, exeuntem e throno Dei et Agni; 
in medio plateae      ejus et fluvii hinc et illinc arbor vitae faciens fructus      duodecim, juxta mensem quemvis reddens fructum suum, Apoc.      xxii 1, 2; </p>
<p>`juxta mensem quemvis reddens fructum 
suum' pro novo semper statu quoad boni receptionem, et inde exercitium:  apud Mosen,      Recense filios Levi, juxta domum patris eorum, et juxta      familias eorum, omnem masculum, a filio mensis 
et supra      recensebis illos....Recense omnem primogenitum masculum      filiorum Israelis a filio mensis et supra, et tolle numerum      nominum eorum, Num. {1}iii 15, 40; </p>
<p>quia finis prioris 
status et principium sequentis, [2]seu novus status, per `mensem' significabatur, mandatum est ut recensio eorum fieret `a filio mensis et supra':  apud eundem,      Si videris in captivitate mulierem 
pulchram forma, et      desideraveris illam, ut accipias tibi in uxorem, ...removebit      vestem captivitatis suae desuper se, et sedebit in domo tua,      et deflebit patrem suum, et matrem 
suam mense dierum,      ...postea intrabis ad illam, et cognosces illam, et erit tibi      in uxorem, Deut. xxi 11, 13; </p>
<p>hic manifeste `mensis dierum' pro fine status prioris et principio sequentis 
seu novi. @1 AI have Num. xi 18, 19, 20, but this refers, not to the sons of Levi but to the eating of quails `not for one day...but for a whole month.'$ </p>
