<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6279节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6279.</strong>“救赎我脱离一切邪恶的那使者”表主的神性人身，把人从地狱解救出来的拯救者。这从“使者”、“救赎”和“邪恶”的含义清楚可知：“使者”是指主的神性人身，如下文所述；“救赎”是指解救，如下文所述；“邪恶”是指地狱。“邪恶”之所以表示地狱，是因为地狱本身无非是邪恶；事实上，无论你说地狱里的所有人都是邪恶，或地狱是邪恶，都是一回事。当提及“邪恶（经上或译为祸患）”时，就灵义而言，所指的是地狱；事实上，那些知道灵义的人，如天上的天使，在思考和谈论时，并不涉及任何特定的人，而是从人抽象出来，因为他们关心的是普遍和总体；因此，对他们来说，邪恶就是地狱。<br />当“罪”这个词用来表示主导恶时，这同样适用于它，如创世记：<br />耶和华对该隐说，你若行得不好，罪就伏在门前。他必恋慕你，你却要制伏他。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创4.6.htm">4:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创4.7.htm">7</a>）<br />此处“罪”表示地狱，当一个人行恶时，地狱就在眼前。而且，人里面的邪恶本身无非是地狱，因为它从地狱流入他里面；这时，此人便是一个微型地狱，甚至每个地狱居民都是一个微型地狱。反过来也一样，人里面的良善本身无非是他里面的天堂；因为良善从主经由天堂流入；处于良善的人就是一个微型天堂，甚至每个天堂居民都是一个微型天堂。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6279</b></p><p><b>6279.</b>
The Angel who redeemeth me from all evil. That this signifies the Lord's Divine Human by which is effected deliverance from hell, is evident from the signification of "angel," as being the Lord's Divine 
Human (of which below); from the signification of "redeeming," as being to deliver (of which also below); and from the signification of "evil," as being hell. The reason why "evil" denotes hell is 
that hell itself is nothing but evil; for whether you say that all in hell are evil, or that hell is evil, it is the same. In the spiritual sense, when "evil" is mentioned, hell is meant, for they who 
are in the spiritual sense, as are the angels in heaven, think and speak abstractedly from persons, because universally, and therefore to them evil is hell. It is the same with "sin," when thereby is 
meant the ruling evil, as in Genesis: </p>
<p>     Jehovah said unto Cain, If thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door; and unto thee is his desire, and thou shall rule over him (Gen. 4:6, 7); </p>
<p>where 
"sin" denotes hell, which is at hand when a man does evil. The very evil with man is nothing else than hell, for it inflows therefrom, and the man is then a hell in the least form, as also is everyone 
there. So on the other hand, the very good in man is nothing else than heaven in him; for good flows in through heaven from the Lord; and the man who is in good, is heaven in the smallest image, as also 
is everyone in heaven. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6279</b></p><p><b>6279.</b>
'The angel redeeming me from every evil' means the Lord's Divine Human, the deliverer from hell. This is clear from the meaning of 'the angel' as the Lord's Divine Human, dealt with below; from the meaning 
of 'redeeming' as delivering, also dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'evil' as hell. The reason why 'evil' means hell is that hell itself is nothing but evil; for whether you say that all 
in hell are evil or that hell is evil, it amounts to the same thing. When the word 'evil' is used hell is meant in the spiritual sense; for whenever those who know the spiritual sense, as the angels 
in heaven do, think and express themselves, they do so without reference to any specific persons because they are concerned with the general and overall. This is why for them 'evil' means hell. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
The same applies to the word 'sin', when it is used to mean a dominant evil, as in Genesis <a href="4.htm">4</a>, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah said to Cain, If you do not do well, sin is lying at the door. To you is his desire, and you 
will have dominion over him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%204:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 4:6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'sin' stands for hell, which is at hand when a person does what is evil. Also the evil present in a person is itself nothing else than hell, for it flows 
into him from there, making him at this time a miniature hell, even as each of its inhabitants is one. It is like the contrary situation when the good present with a person is itself nothing else 
than heaven in him, for good flows into him from the Lord through heaven, making the person with whom good resides a miniature heaven, even as each inhabitant of heaven is one. </p>

`Angelus redimens me ab omni malo':  quod significet Divinum Humanum Domini a quo liberatio ab inferno, constat a significatione `angeli' quod sit Divinum Humanum Domini, de qua sequitur; {1}ex significatione 
`redimere' quod sit liberare, de qua etiam sequitur; et a significatione `mali' quod sit infernum; quod `malum' sit infernum est quia ipsum infernum non est nisi quam malum; sive enim dicas 
quod omnes in inferno sint mali, sive dicas quod infernum sit malum, idem est; in sensu spirituali, cum dicitur malum, intelligitur infernum, nam qui in sensu spirituali sunt ut sunt angeli in caelo, 
abstracte a personis quia universaliter, cogitant et loquuntur, ita malum illis est infernum; [2] similiter peccatum, cum per id intelligitur malum dominans, ut Gen. iv, Dixit Jehovah ad Cain,... Si 
non benefacis, ad januam  peccatum cubat, {1} ad te desiderium ejus, et tu domineris ei, vers.  6, 7; </p>
<p>ibi `peccatum' pro inferno, quod praesto est cum homo malum facit; ipsum etiam malum apud hominem 
non est nisi quam infernum, nam influit inde, et est homo tunc in minima imagine infernum, ut quoque est unusquisque ibi; sicut vicissim ipsum bonum apud hominem non est nisi quam caelum in illo, nam 
bonum per caelum influit a Domino; et est homo qui in bono, in minima imagine caelum, ut quoque est unusquisque {2}in caelo'. @1 i et$ @2 qui ibi$ </p>
