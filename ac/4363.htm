<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4363.</strong>创世记33:8-11.以扫说，我所遇见的这些营是什么意思呢？雅各说，是要在我主眼前蒙恩的。以扫说，兄弟啊，我的已经够了，你的仍归你吧！雅各说，不然，我若在你眼前蒙恩，就求你从我手里收下这礼物，因为我见了你的面，如同见了神的面，并且你容纳了我。求你收下我带来给你的祝福礼，因为神施恩给我，使我一切充足。雅各再三地求他，他才收下了。<br />“以扫说，我所遇见的这些营是什么意思呢”表出自真理之良善的具体事物。“雅各说，是要在我主眼前蒙恩的”表蒙恩的引入。“以扫说，兄弟啊，我的已经够了，你的仍归你吧”表默示接受，以便祂能以这种方式注入对从真理发展而来的良善的情感。“雅各说，不然”表该情感的诞生。“我若在你眼前蒙恩，就求你从我手里收下这礼物”表该情感的回应，以便它能被注入。“因为我见了你的面，如同见了神的面，并且你容纳了我”表它藉以相应被注入的觉知里面的情感本身。“求你收下我带来给你的祝福礼”表要被联结到神性属世良善上的神性良善与真理。“因为神施恩给我”表圣治（Providence）所赋予的。“使我一切充足”表祂的属灵财富。“雅各再三地求他，他才收下了”表源于真理之良善的这情感通过神性良善所激发的情感被注入。</p>

Verses 8-11. And he said, What to thee are all these camps which I met? And he said, To find grace in the eyes of my lord. And Esau said, I have much, my brother, be to thee what is to thee. And Jacob 
said, Nay I pray, if I pray I have found grace in thine eyes, then accept my present from my hand; for because that I have seen thy faces like seeing the faces of God, and thou hast accepted me. Take 
I pray my blessing that is brought to thee, because God hath graciously bestowed upon me, and because I have all. And he urged him, and he took it. "And he said, What to thee are all these camps which 
I met?" signifies the special things which are thence derived; "and he said, To find grace in the eyes of my lord," signifies grateful initiation; "and Esau said, I have much, my brother, be to thee 
what is to thee," signifies tacit acceptance, in order that he might thus instill the affection of the good from truth; "and Jacob said, Nay I pray," signifies the first beginning of affection; "if 
I pray I have found grace in thine eyes, then accept my present from my hand," signifies the reciprocal of affection in order that it might be instilled; "for because that I have seen thy faces like seeing 
the faces of God, and thou hast accepted me," signifies the affection itself in the perception with which it was reciprocally instilled; "take I pray my blessing that is brought to thee," signifies 
the Divine things that were to be adjoined to Divine good natural; "because God hath graciously bestowed upon me," signifies from Providence; "and because I have all," signifies His spiritual riches; 
"and he urged him, and he took it," signifies that from the good of truth this affection was instilled by means of affection inspired by Divine good. </p>

Verses 8-11 And he said, What do you mean by all this camp which I met? And he said, To find favour in the eyes of my lord. And Esau said, I have much, my brother; let what is yours be yours. And Jacob 
said, No, I beg of you; if now I have found favour in your eyes, then take my gift from my hand; inasmuch as I have seen your face, as though seeing the face of God, and you have accepted me. Take 
now my blessing which is brought to you, because God has graciously bestowed much on me, and because I have everything. And he urged him, and he took it. </p>
<p>'He said, What do you mean by all this camp 
which I met?' means the specific things which came from the good of truth. 'And he said, To find favour in the eyes of my lord' means an introduction that went favourably. 'And Esau said, I have much, 
my brother; let what is yours be yours' means a tacit acceptance, in order that in this way He might instill the affection for good that develops out of truth. 'And Jacob said, No, I beg of you' means 
the birth of that affection. 'If now I have found favour in your eyes, then take my gift from my hand' means the reciprocation of that affection, in order that it might be instilled. 'Inasmuch as I 
have seen your face, as though seeing the face of God, and you have accepted me' means the affection itself within that perception by which it was instilled reciprocally. 'Take now my blessing which 
is brought to you' means the Divine goods and truths which were to become linked to Divine Natural Good. 'Because God has graciously bestowed much on me' means conferred by Providence. 'And because I 
have everything' means his spiritual riches. 'And he urged him, and he took it' means that that affection originating in the good of truth was instilled by means of affection inspired by Divine Good. </p>

Vers. 8-11.  Et dixit, Quae tibi omnia castra illa quibus occurri? et dixit, Ad inveniendum gratiam in oculis domini mei. Et dixit Esau, Est mihi multum, frater mi, sit tibi quod tibi.  Et dixit 
Jacob, Ne quaeso, si quaeso inveni gratiam in oculis tuis, et accipias munus meum e manu mea, quia propterea quod vidi `facies tuas sicut videre facies Dei, et acceptasti me.  Accipe quaeso benedictionem 
meam, quae adducta tibi, quia gratiose largitus mihi Deus, et quia est mihi omne; et ursit (c)illum, et accepit.  `Dixit, Quae tibi omnia castra illa quibus occurri' significat specialia quae

spirituales: `et ursit illum, et accepit' significat quod a veri bono illa per affectionem inspiratam a Divino Bono insinuaretur. </p>
