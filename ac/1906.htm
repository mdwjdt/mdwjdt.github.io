<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1906.</strong>“亚伯兰在迦南地住了十年之后”表主为自己所获得的良善及其衍生真理的余留，这理性凭这余留被孕育。这从“十”的含义、以及有关余留的阐述和说明（<a href="468.htm">468</a>，<a href="530.htm">530</a>，<a href="560.htm">560</a>，<a href="561.htm">561</a>，<a href="660.htm">660</a>，<a href="661.htm">661</a>，<a href="798.htm">798</a>，<a href="1050.htm">1050</a>节）清楚可知，前面说明，“十”表余留（<a href="576.htm">576</a>节）。也就是说，它们全都是对善与真的情感的状态，主自人的襁褓时代，直至生命结束，便将这些状态赐给了他。它们被储存在他里面，以备他死后的生命所用。因为在来世，其生命的所有状态会依次返回，然后被主所赋予他的善与真的状态所调和。因此，人在世时所接受的余留，即所获得的善与真越多，他其余的状态返回时就显得越快乐、美丽。人若认真思考这个问题，这一事实是很明显的。人生来凭自己根本没有一丝良善，而是被遗传之恶全然玷污。一切良善，如他对父母、保姆、玩伴的爱，都是流入的，这种流注来自纯真。这些就是从主经由纯真和平安的天堂，也就是至内在的天堂所流入之物，这就是在人还是婴幼儿时它们被赋予他的方式。<br />后来，随着他长大，婴幼儿的这种良善、纯真、平安的状态渐渐消退。只要他被引入这个世界，就会进入它的乐趣和快乐，因而进入邪恶中，而婴幼儿的属天或良善之物便开始消散。不过，它们仍旧存留，人后来所具有或获得的状态就是被它们所调和。若没有它们，人永远不可能成为人。因为恶欲或邪恶的状态若不被对良善的情感的状态所调和，会比任何动物的更残暴、可怕。这些良善的状态就是所谓的余留，主在人不知不觉的情况下将这些余留赐予人，并植入在他的属世性情中。<br />在以后的生活中，他还会被赐予新的状态。但这些状态与说是良善的状态，不如说是真理的状态。因为随着他长大，他逐渐充满真理，这些真理同样被储存在他的内层人中。凭借主的属灵事物的流注所产生的这些余留，也就是真理的余留，人能思考，也能理解何为文明道德生活的善与真，还能接受属灵真理或信。但他只能凭借婴幼儿时所接受的良善的余留做到这一切。人全然不知余留的存在，也不知它们被储存在人里面，就在他的内层理性中。因为他以为没有什么东西流入进来，一切事物天生就在他里面，因而在他还是婴幼儿时就存在于他里面。然而，事实完全不是这样。余留在圣言中多有提及，它们表示人借以成为人的那些状态，这一切来自独一的主。<br />然而，属于主的余留全都是祂为自己所获得的神性状态，祂凭这些状态将人性本质与神性本质融合起来。这些余留决不可与属于人的余留相提并论，因为后者并非神性，而是人性。属于主的余留就是“亚伯兰在迦南地住了十年”所表示的。天使倾听圣言时，并不知道“十”是什么，但人一提及十，他们就会想到余留。因为在圣言中，“十”和“十分之一”均表示余留，这从前面所述（<a href="576.htm">576</a>，<a href="1738.htm">1738</a>节）明显可知。当领悟“亚伯兰在迦南地住了十年”时，他们会想到主，同时想到主在世时所具有的余留所表示的无数事物。</p>

After ten years of Abram's dwelling in the land of Canaan. That this signifies the remains of good and of the derivative truth which the Lord procured to Himself, and by means of which that rational 
was conceived, is evident from the signification of "ten," as being remains, spoken of before (n. 576). What remains are, has been stated and shown above (n. 468, 530, 560, 561, 661, 798, 1050), namely, 
that they are all the states of the affection of good and truth with which a man is gifted by the Lord, from earliest infancy even to the end of life; which states are stored up for him for the use 
of his life after death; for in the other life all the states of his life return in succession, and are then tempered by the states of good and truth with which he has been gifted by the Lord. The more 
remains therefore that a man has received in the life of the body, that is, the more of good and truth, the more delightful and beautiful do the rest of his states appear when they return. That this 
is really so may be evident to everyone, if he will consider. When a man is born he has not a particle of good of himself, but is wholly defiled throughout with hereditary evil, and all that is good 
flows in, such as his love for his parents, his nurses, his companions; and this from innocence. Such are the things that flow in from the Lord through the heaven of innocence and peace, which is the 
inmost heaven, and thus is man imbued with them in his infancy.  [2] Afterwards, when he grows up, this good, innocent, and peaceful state of infancy recedes little by little; and so far as he is introduced 
into the world, he comes into its pleasures, and into cupidities, and thus into evils; and so far the celestial or good things of the age of infancy begin to disappear; but still they remain, 
and the states which the man afterwards puts on or acquires are tempered by them. Without them a man can never be a man, for the states of the cupidities, or of evil, if not tempered by states of the 
affection of good, would be more atrocious than those of any animal. These states of good are what are called remains, given by the Lord and implanted in one's natural disposition, and this when the 
man is not aware of it.  [3] In after life he is also gifted with new states; but these are not so much states of good as states of truth, for as he is growing up he is imbued with truths, and these 
are in like manner stored up in him in his interior man. By these remains, which are those of truth, born of the influx of spiritual things from the Lord, man has the ability to think, and also to understand 
what the good and the truth of civic and moral life are, and also to receive spiritual truth or faith; but he cannot do this except by means of the remains of good that he had received in infancy. 
That there are remains, and that they are stored up in a man in his interior rational, is wholly unknown to man; and this because he supposes that nothing flows in, but that everything is natural 
to him, and born with him, thus that it is all in him when an infant, when yet the real case is altogether different. Remains are treated of in many parts of the Word, and by them are signified those 
states by which man becomes a man, and this from the Lord alone.  [4] But the remains that appertained to the Lord were all the Divine states which He procured for Himself, and by which He united the 
Human Essence to the Divine Essence. These cannot be compared to the remains that pertain to man, for the latter are not Divine, but human. It is the remains appertaining to the Lord that are signified 
by the "ten years in which Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan." When angels hear the Word, they do not know what the number ten is, but as soon as it is named by man the idea of remains occurs to them; 
for by "ten" and "tenths" in the Word are signified remains, as is evident from what was shown above (n. 576, 1738); and when a perception comes to them based on the idea of the end of the ten years 
that Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, the idea of the Lord comes to them, and at the same time innumerable things that are signified by the remains in the Lord during the time that He was in the world. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1906</b></p><p><b>1906.</b>
'After Abram had been dwelling ten years in the land of Canaan' means the remnants of good and of truth deriving from that good which the Lord acquired to Himself and by means of which this rational 
was conceived. This is clear from the meaning of 'ten' as remnants, dealt with already in <a href="576.htm">576</a>. What remnants are has been stated and shown in <a href="468.htm">468</a>, <a href="530.htm">530</a>, <a href="560.htm">560</a>, <a href="561.htm">561</a>, <a href="660.htm">660</a>, <a href="661.htm">661</a>, <a href="798.htm">798</a>, <a href="1050.htm">1050</a>; that is to say, they 
are all the states of affection for good and truth conferred by the Lord on a person from earliest childhood right through to life's end. These states are stored away within him for the use of his 
life after death, for in the next life all the states of his life return one after another and at that time they undergo modification through the states of good and truth which the Lord has conferred 
on him. The more remnants he acquires therefore during his lifetime, or the more good and truth he acquires, the happier and more beautiful the rest of his states seem to be when they actually return. 
The truth of this may become clear to anyone if he gives the matter careful consideration. At birth no one of himself possesses any good at all, but is wholly defiled with hereditary evil. Everything 
good flows in, such as his love for parents, nursemaids, and playmates, this influx being from innocence. These are the gifts which flow in from the Lord through the heaven of innocence and peace, which 
is the inmost heaven, and this is the manner in which they are imparted to him during early childhood. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Later on, when he grows up, this good, innocent, and peaceful state of early childhood 
departs from him little by little; and insofar as he is introduced into the world, he enters into its pleasures and delights, and so into evils, and the heavenly things or the goods of early childhood 
start to be dispersed. Yet they still remain, it being by means of these that the states are moderated which a person takes to himself and acquires later on. Without them he cannot possibly be truly 
human, for states in which evil desires or any evils occur, if not moderated by means of states in which the affection for good is present, would be more dreadful than those of any animal. Those states 
of good are what are called remnants, which are conferred by the Lord and implanted in a person's natural disposition, this being done when the person is not aware of it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In later life he has 
further new states conferred on him; but these are not so much states of good as of truth, for as he grows up he has truths bestowed on him, and these in a similar way are stored away within his interior 
man. By means of these remnants, which are those of truth, and which have been born from the influx of spiritual things from the Lord, a person has the ability to think, and also to understand 
what the good and truth of civil or public life and moral or private life are, and also to receive spiritual truth, that is, the truth of faith. Yet he has no ability to do these things except by means 
of the remnants of good which he received in early childhood. Of the existence of remnants, and the fact that they are stored away in man in his interior rational, man is completely unaware. That unawareness 
is due to thinking that nothing flows in but that everything is innate within him, and thus present within him when he is an infant, though the reality is altogether different from that. Remnants 
are referred to in various places in the Word, and by them are meant those states by which a person becomes human, and this from the Lord alone. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The remnants which resided with the Lord however 
were all the Divine states which He acquired to Himself and by means of which He united the Human Essence to the Divine Essence. These are in no way comparable with the remnants that reside with 
man, for the latter are not Divine but human. The remnants the Lord had are what is meant by the ten years Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan. When angels hear the Word they have no knowledge of what 
'ten' is; but the moment ten is mentioned by man the idea of remnants comes to them, for 'ten' and 'tenths' in the Word mean remnants, as is clear from what has been stated and shown in <a href="576.htm">576</a>, <a href="1738.htm">1738</a>. And 
when they perceive that 'Abram had been dwelling ten years in the land of Canaan' the idea of the Lord comes to them, and with it simultaneously countless things meant by the remnants residing with 
the Lord when He was in the world. </p>

`A fine decem annorum ab habitando Abram in terra Canaan': quod significet reliquias boni et inde veri (o)quas Sibi comparavit Dominus, per quas conceptum rationale illud, constat ex significatione 
`decem' quod sint reliquiae, de qua prius n. 576; quid reliquiae, dictum et ostensum est n. 468, 530, 560, 561, 660, 661, 798, 1050, quod nempe sint omnes status affectionis boni et veri, quibus donatur 
homo a Domino a prima infantia usque ad finem vitae, qui status reconduntur illi in usum vitae ejus post mortem, nam omnes ejus vitae status in altera vita successive redeunt, et tunc temperantur ii 
per status boni et veri quibus a Domino donatus est; quo itaque plus reliquiarum in vita corporis accepit, seu plus boni et veri, eo jucundiores et pulchriores apparent status ejus ceteri cum redeant: 
quod ita se res habeat, unicuique constare potest si expendat; homo dum nascitur, ne hilum boni ex se ipso habet, sed {1} totus quantus malo hereditario conspurcatus est, at omne bonum influit, ut 
quod amet parentes, nutrices, similes sui, et hoc ex innocentia; haec sunt quae a Domino per caelum innocentiae et pacis, quod intimum est, influant; et sic homo, dum infans est, illis imbuitur; [2] postea 
cum adolescit, paullatim bonum, innocens, et pacificum hoc infantile recedit; et quantum in mundum introducitur, tantum in voluptates inde et in cupiditates, ita in mala, et tantum aetatis infantilis 
caelestia seu bona disparari incipiunt, sed usque remanent et per eos temperantur status quos postea homo induit et sibi acquirit; absque illis nusquam homo potest esse homo; status enim cupiditatum 
seu mali absque temperatura per status affectionis boni, forent atrociores quam ullius animalis; status illi boni sunt qui appellantur reliquiae, a Domino donatae et ejus indoli implantatae, et hoc 
cum homo nescit; [3] in sequente aetate etiam novis donatur, sed ii status non ita sunt boni sed veri, nam cum adolescit, imbuitur veris, et similiter apud eum in interiore ejus homine reconduntur; 
per has reliquias quae sunt veri, natas ex influxu spiritualium a Domino, homo habet quod cogitare possit, ut et intelligere quid bonum et verum vitae civilis et moralis, tum etiam recipere verum spirituale 
seu fidei, sed hoc nequit nisi per reliquias boni quas in infantia accepit: quod reliquiae sint, et quod eae recondantur homini in ejus interiore rationali, prorsus nescit homo, ex causa quia 
putat nihil influere, sed quod omne sit naturale quoddam ei connatum, ita quod (o)omne sit in se cum infans, cum tamen prorsus aliter se res habeat; de reliquiis passim agitur in Verbo, et per illas significantur 
status illi per quos homo fit homo et hoc a solo Domino.  [4] Reliquiae autem quae apud Dominum, fuerunt omnes status Divini quos Sibi Ipsi comparavit, et per quos Humanam Essentiam univit 
Divinae; non comparandae (o)sunt cum reliquiis apud hominem, nam hae non sunt Divinae sed humanae: illae reliquiae sunt quae significantur per `decem annos quibus Abram habitavit in terra Canaan cum 
angeli audiunt Verbum, non sciunt quid `decem,' sed ilico cum {2} nominantur ab homine, obvenit illis idea reliquiarum, nam per `decem et decimas' in Verbo significantur reliquiae, ut constat {3} ab 
illis quae dicta et ostensa sunt n. 576, 1738; et cum percipiunt quod `fuerit a fine decem annorum, quo habitavit Abram in terra Canaan,' obvenit idea Domini, et simul innumera quae significantur per 
reliquias apud Dominum cum fuit in mundo. 	@1 nam.$ 	@2 dum.$ 	@3 i etiam.$ </p>
