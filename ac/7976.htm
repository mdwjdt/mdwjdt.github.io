<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7976节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7976.</strong>“和他们一同上去”表加入之物。这从“和他们一同上去”的含义清楚可知，“和他们一同上去”当论及良善和真理时，是指它们加入了。因为对一个属灵人来说，非纯正的真理和良善的确从纯正的良善和真理那里被分离出去了，但没有被带走，而是加到周边，就是它们被抛弃的地方（参看<a href="7975.htm">7975</a>节）。主在外邦人当中的教会也是这种情况，他们没有纯正的真理。在天堂，这些民族也加入到那些拥有纯正真理和良善的人当中。</p>

Went up with them. That this signifies which was adjoined, is evident from the signification of "going up with them," when said of goods and truths, as being that they were adjoined; for truths and goods 
not genuine are indeed separated from the genuine goods and truths with the spiritual man, but are not taken away, remaining adjoined at the side whither they are rejected (see n. 7975). The case 
is similar with the Lord's church among the Gentiles, who have not genuine truths; these also in heaven are adjoined to those who are in genuine truths and goods. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7976</b></p><p><b>7976.</b>
'Went up with them' means which were joined on. This is clear from the meaning of 'going up with them', when said of forms of good and truths, as the fact that they were joined on. For with a spiritual 
person truths and forms of good that are not genuine are indeed separated from the forms of good and the truths which are genuine; but they are not taken away. They remain, joined on at the sides, 
where they have been cast, <a href="7975.htm">7975</a>. A similar situation exists with the Lord's Church among gentile nations in possession of truths that are not genuine. Those nations in heaven too are joined on to those 
who are in possession of genuine truths and forms of good. </p>

</p><b>7976.</b>
`Ascendit cum illis': quod significet quae adjuncta, constat ex significatione `ascendere cum illis' cum dicitur de bonis et veris, quod sit quod {1} adjuncta, nam vera et bona non genuina separantur 
quidem a bonis et veris genuinis apud hominem spiritualem, sed non auferuntur; remanent adjuncta a latere quo rejecta, n. 7975 fin.  Similiter se habet cum Ecclesia Domini inter gentes {2}quibus vera 
non genuina; illae in caelo etiam adjunctae sunt illis qui in veris et bonis genuinis sunt. 	@1 i sunt$ 	@2 ubi non vera genuina; (m)sunt in coelo adjunctae illis qui in bonis genuinis sunt(n)$ </p>
