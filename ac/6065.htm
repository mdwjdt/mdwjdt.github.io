<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6065节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6065.</strong>“以及他们的羊群、牛群”表真理的内层和外层良善。这从“羊群”和“牛群”的含义清楚可知，“羊群”是指内层良善，“牛群”是指外层良善（参看<a href="5913.htm">5913</a>，<a href="6048.htm">6048</a>节）。之所以表示真理之良善，是因为“以色列”所代表的属灵良善是真理之良善（<a href="4598.htm">4598</a>节）。存在于天堂或与人同在的良善有两种不同的来源；也就是说，它们或源于意愿，或源于理解力。源于意愿的良善存在于属于属天教会的上古之人当中，而源于理解力的良善则存在于属于属灵教会的古人当中。第一种良善存在于至内或第三层天堂的天使当中，而第二种良善则存在于中间或第二层天堂的天使当中。我们在这些解释中已多次说明它们之间的区别是什么，以及这种区别是何性质。源于意愿的良善是真理所来自的良善，而源于理解力的良善则是来自真理的良善，或真理之良善。该良善本身无非是行为中的真理，或说付诸实践的真理。</p>

And their flocks, and their herds. That this signifies the interior and the exterior goods of truth, is evident from the signification of "flocks," as being interior goods, and of "herds," as being exterior 
goods (see n. 5913, 6048). The reason why the goods of truth are signified, is that spiritual good, which is represented by Israel, is the good of truth (n. 4598). The goods which are in heaven 
and with man are from a double origin, namely, from an origin in the will and from an origin in the understanding. In the good that originates in the will were the most ancient people who were of the 
celestial church, but in the good that originates in the understanding were the ancient people who were of the spiritual church. In the former good are they who are in the inmost or third heaven, but 
in the latter good are they who are in the middle or second heaven. What and of what nature is the difference has been frequently told in these explications. The good which originates in the will is 
the good from which is truth; but the good which originates in the understanding is the good which is from truth, or the good of truth. In itself this good is nothing else than truth in act. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6065</b></p><p><b>6065.</b>
'Their flocks and their herds' means forms of the good of truth, interior and exterior ones. This is clear from the meaning of 'flocks' as interior forms of good, and of 'herds' as exterior forms of 
good, both dealt with in <a href="5913.htm">5913</a>, <a href="6048.htm">6048</a>. The reason forms of the good of truth are what is meant is that spiritual good, which is represented by 'Israel', is the good of truth, <a href="4598.htm">4598</a>. Forms of good as they 
exist in heaven or with man have two different origins; that is to say, they originate in the will or in the understanding. Good that originated in the will existed among the most ancient people who 
belonged to the celestial Church, whereas good that originated in the understanding existed among the ancients who belonged to the spiritual Church. The first kind of good exists with those in the inmost 
or third heaven, the second kind with those in the middle or second heaven. What the difference is between them, and the nature of that difference, has been stated many times in explanations. Good 
that has its origin in the will is good from which truth is derived, whereas good that has its origin in the understanding is good which is a product of truth, that is, it is the good of truth. Essentially 
this good is nothing else than truth put into practice. </p>

`{1}Greges eorum et armenta eorum':  quod significet veri bona interiora et exteriora, constat ex significatione `gregum' quod sint bona interiora, et `armentorum' quod sint bona exteriora, de quibus 
n. 5913, 6048; quod sint veri bona quae significantur, est quia bonum spirituale quod repraesentatur per `Israelem', est veri bonum, n. 4598.  Bona quae in caelo et apud hominem, sunt ex duplici origine, 
nempe ex origine in voluntate et ex origine in intellectu; in bono ex origine in voluntate fuerunt Antiquissimi qui ab Ecclesia caelesti, at in bono ex origine in intellectu fuerunt Antiqui qui 
ab Ecclesia spirituali; in illo bono sunt qui in intimo seu tertio caelo, in hoc autem sunt qui in medio seu secundo caelo; quae et qualis differentia, pluries in explicationibus dictum est; bonum quod 
ex origine in voluntate, est bonum ex quo verum, at bonum quod ex origine in intellectu, est bonum quod ex vero seu bonum veri; hoc bonum in se non est nisi quam verum actu. @1 see p. 447, ftnote I$ </p>
