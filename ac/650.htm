<p><strong>[NCE]650.</strong> The symbolism of the length as the holiness of the remnant, of the width as its truth, and of the height as its goodness, expressed in numbers, is not so easy to prove by the Word, because the meanings of each relate to the object or entity being described. Length, for example, when ascribed to time symbolizes what lasts to eternity, as in the phrase length of days (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_650/bible_king-james-version_psalms_23_6" target=_top>Psalms 23:6</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_650/bible_king-james-version_psalms_21_4" target=_top>21:4</a>). But when ascribed to distance, length symbolizes something holy, and this meaning follows from the former. The case with width and height is similar.<br />All earthly things have three dimensions, but the same dimensions cannot be applied to heavenly and spiritual things. When applied to something heavenly or spiritual — in abstraction from the dimensions — they mean more perfection or less, and also the nature or amount of the thing. So in the present verse the measurements imply the nature (they were traces) and amount (there were only a few). </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 650</b></p><p><b>650.</b>
That "length" signifies the holiness, "breadth" the truth, and "height" the good of whatever things are described by the numbers, cannot so well be confirmed from the Word, because they are each and 
all predicated according to the subject or thing treated of. Thus "length" as applied to time signifies perpetuity and eternity, as "length of days" in Ps. 23:6, and 21:4; but as applied to space it denotes 
holiness, as follows therefrom. And the same is the case with "breadth" and "height." There is a trinal dimension of all earthly things, but such dimensions cannot be predicated of celestial and 
spiritual things. When they are predicated, greater or less perfection is meant, apart from the dimensions, and also the quality and quantity; thus here the quality, that they were remains; and the 
quantity, that they were few. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 650</b></p><p><b>650.</b>
'Length' means the holiness, 'breadth' the truth, and 'height' the good, of the remnants described by the numbers. This cannot be confirmed so easily from the Word because every single thing has reference 
to the particular subject or thing under discussion. For example, when 'length' applies to time it means perpetual and eternal, as in 'length of days' <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2023:6;%2021:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 23:6; 21:4</a>, but when it applies to space 
it means consequent holiness. The situation is the same with 'breadth' and 'height'. All earthly objects are three-dimensional, but no such dimensions can be used in reference to celestial and spiritual 
things. When they are used to refer to these they mean the degree of perfection, greater or less, independent of the dimensions given, as well as identity and quantity. In this case they are identified 
as remnants, which are few in quantity. </p>

</p><b>650.</b>
Quod 'longitudo' significet illarum sanctum, 'latitudo' illarum verum, et 'altitudo' illarum bonum, quae describuntur per numeros, non ita confirmari potest ex Verbo, quia praedicantur omnia et singula 
ex subjecto aut re, de qua agitur; sicut 'longitudo' applicate ad tempus significat perpetuum et aeternum, ut 'longitudo dierum,' Ps. xxiii 6; Ps. xxi 5 [A.V.4]; at applicate ad spatium significat 
sanctum quod inde sequitur: ita quoque se habet cum 'latitudine, et altitudine': trina dimensio omnium est in terrestribus, sed tales dimensiones non praedicari possunt de caelestibus et spiritualibus; 
cum praedicantur, abstracte a dimensionibus intelligitur perfectio major et minor, tum ejus quale et quantum; ut hic quale quod sint reliquiae, et earum quantum quod sint paucae. </p>
