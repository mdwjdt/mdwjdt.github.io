<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1442.</strong>“摩利橡树那里”表最初的直觉。这也可从事件的顺序清楚看出来。显然，一旦耶和华向主显明祂的属天事物，主就获得直觉；一切直觉皆来自属天事物。至于何为直觉，我在前面已阐述并说明（<a href="104.htm">104</a>，<a href="202.htm">202</a>，<a href="371.htm">371</a>，<a href="483.htm">483</a>，<a href="495.htm">495</a>，<a href="503.htm">503</a>，<a href="521.htm">521</a>，<a href="536.htm">536</a>，<a href="865.htm">865</a>节）。人若获得属天事物，就能从主获得直觉。凡变成诸如上古教会成员那样的属天之人的，都会获得直觉，如前所示（<a href="125.htm">125</a>，<a href="597.htm">597</a>，<a href="607.htm">607</a>，<a href="784.htm">784</a>，<a href="895.htm">895</a>节）。然而，凡变成属灵之人的，即从主那里获得仁爱的，都拥有类似直觉的某种东西，也就是良知的声音，或强或弱，视这类人所具有的仁爱的属天事物而定。仁爱的属天事物就带有这种直觉；因为主唯独存在于这些事物里面，并在其中向人显现。这种直觉必然更多地适合主，祂自婴幼儿时就逐渐向耶和华发展，与祂联结并融合，以致祂们为一。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1442.</strong> The symbolism of all the way to the oak grove of Moreh as the dawn of perception can also be seen from the course of progress here. It is plain that as soon as Jehovah appeared to the Lord in his heavenly aspects, the Lord acquired perception. All perception results from heavenly traits.

Those who became heavenly people, as members of the earliest church did, all received perception (as demonstrated before, in 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1442/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_125" target=_top>125</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1442/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_597" target=_top>597</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1442/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_607" target=_top>607</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1442/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_784" target=_top>784</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1442/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_895" target=_top>895</a>). Those who become spiritual people 钬?that is, who receive from the Lord the gift of neighborly love 钬?have something analogous to perception. Or they hear the voice of conscience, which speaks more or less clearly, depending on the extent to which they become heavenly in their love for others. This is an inherent result of loving others in a heavenly way, since the Lord is present only in the heavenly aspects of charity, which also reveal him to our eyes. How much more true this was for the Lord, who developed from being an infant into being Jehovah, and who was joined and united with Jehovah to the point of being one with him. </p>

Unto the oak-grove Moreh. That this signifies the first perception, is also evident from the order. As soon as Jehovah appeared to the Lord in His celestial things it is evident that He attained perception; 
all perception is from celestial things. What perception is, has been declared and shown before (n. 104, 202, 371, 483, 495, 503, 521, 536, 865). Everyone receives perception from the Lord when 
he comes to celestial things. They who have become celestial men, such as those of the Most Ancient Church, have all received perception, as before shown (n. 125, 597, 607, 784, 895). They who become 
spiritual men, that is, who receive charity from the Lord, have something analogous to perception, or rather they have a dictate of conscience, more or less clear, in proportion as they are in the celestial 
things of charity. The celestial things of charity are attended with this; for in them alone the Lord is present, and in them He appears to man. How much more must this have been the case with 
the Lord, who from infancy advanced to Jehovah, and was conjoined and united to Him, so that they were One. </p>

'As far as the oak-grove of Moreh' means a first perception. This too becomes clear from the sequence of events. It is clear that as soon as Jehovah appeared to the Lord in His celestial things the Lord 
had attained perception. Celestial things are the source of all perception What perception is has been stated and shown already in <a href="104.htm">104</a>, <a href="202.htm">202</a>, <a href="371.htm">371</a>, <a href="483.htm">483</a>, <a href="495.htm">495</a>, <a href="503.htm">503</a>, <a href="521.htm">521</a>, <a href="536.htm">536</a>, <a href="865.htm">865</a>. When anyone attains 
to celestial things he acquires perception from the Lord. All who have become celestial people, such as members of the Most Ancient Church, have acquired perception, as shown already in <a href="125.htm">125</a>, <a href="597.htm">597</a>, <a href="607.htm">607</a>, <a href="784.htm">784</a>, <a href="895.htm">895</a>. All who become spiritual people, however, that is, who acquire charity from the Lord, have something akin to perception, namely the voice of conscience, strong or weak, in the measure that 
the celestial things of charity exist with such persons. This is how it is with the celestial things of charity, for it is in these alone that the Lord is present, and in these that He manifests Himself 
to man. How much more must this have applied to the Lord, who from infancy moved closer to Jehovah, and was joined and united to Him so that they were one? </p>

'Usque ad quercetum Moreh':  quod significet primam perceptionem, constare quoque potest ab ordine; ut primum Jehovah apparuit Domino in Ipsius caelestibus, constat quod perceptionem adeptus; ex caelestibus 
est omnis perceptio: quid perceptio, dictum et ostensum est prius n. 1O4, 2O2, 371, 483, 495, 5O3, 521, 536, 865; quisque dum venit ad caelestia, perceptionem accipit a Domino; qui caelestes 
homines facti, ut qui ab Antiquissima Ecclesia, omnes perceptionem acceperunt, quod ostensum prius n. 125, 597, 607, 784, 895; qui spirituales homines fiunt, hoc est, qui charitatem a Domino accipiunt, 
analogon perceptionis habent, aut dictamen conscientiae, magis et minus, sicut in caelestibus charitatis sunt, perspicuum; caelestia charitatis hoc secum habent, nam in illis solis est Dominus praesens, 
et in illis apparet homini: quanto magis Dominus, Qui progressus ab infantia ad Jehovam, et Ipsi conjunctus et unitus, ut anus essent. </p>
