<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7957节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7957.</strong>“连你们带以色列人”表与从神来的真理，并引向良善的真理，以及源于良善的真理一起。这从“摩西”和“以色列人”的代表清楚可知：“摩西”是指从神来的真理，如刚才所述（<a href="7955.htm">7955</a>节）；“以色列人”是指那些属于属灵教会的人，如前面频繁所述，因而是指那些处于引向良善的真理和源于良善的真理之人。因为属灵教会与属天教会的区别在于，它通过信之真理被引入仁之良善，因此，它视真理为它的本质。对他们来说，与良善的最初接触是通过真理实现的，因为真理教导他们当做什么；当他们践行这真理时，这真理就被称为良善。一旦接触这良善，他们以后就会从该良善来看待真理，这会进一步指示他们当如何行事。由此明显可知，无论你说“那些属于属灵教会的人”，还是说“那些处于引向良善的真理和源于良善的真理之人”，都是一回事。</p>

Both ye and the sons of Israel. That this signifies with that truth from the Divine, and with the truth through which is good, and with the truth which is from good, is evident from the representation 
of Moses, as being truth from the Divine (of which just above, n. 7955); and from the representation of the sons of Israel, as being those who are of the spiritual church (of which frequently above), 
thus those who are in truth through which is good, and in truth which is from good. For the spiritual church is distinguished from the celestial church in this, that through truth which is of faith 
it is introduced into the good which is of charity, thus that it has truth for its essential. The initiation is effected through truth, for through truth they are instructed what must be done, and when 
they do this truth, it is called good. From this good, when they have been initiated, they afterward see truths, according to which they again act. From this it is evident that whether you say "those 
who are of the spiritual church," or "those who are in truth through which is good, and in truth which is from good," it is the same. </p>

'Both you and the children of Israel' means together with their truth from God, and with truth that leads to good and truth which springs from good. This is clear from the representation of 'Moses' as 
the truth from God, dealt with just above in <a href="7955.htm">7955</a>; and from the representation of 'the children of Israel' as those belonging to the spiritual Church, dealt with often, thus those guided by truth that 
leads to good and by truth which springs from good. For the spiritual Church differs from the celestial Church in that it is brought to the good of charity by means of the truth of faith, which being 
so it considers truth to be the essential thing. Initial contact with that good for them is effected through truth, for truth teaches them what they ought to do; and when they do that truth it is called 
good. This good, once they have been brought in contact with it, becomes the standpoint from which they see truths, that show them further how to act. From this it is evident that whether you say 
those belonging to the spiritual Church or those guided by truth through Which good is done, and by truth seen from the standpoint of good, it amounts to the same thing. </p>

`Etiam vos, etiam filii Israelis': quod significet cum vero {1}illorum a Divino, et cum vero per quod bonum, et cum vero quod ex bono, constat ex repraesentatione `Moschis' quod sit verum a Divino, 
de qua mox supra n. 7955; et ex repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis' quod sint qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, de qua saepe, ita qui in vero per quod bonum, et in vero quod ex bono; Ecclesia enim spiritualis 
distinguitur ab Ecclesia caelesti in eo quod per verum quod fidei introducatur in bonum quod charitatis, ita quod pro essentiali habeat verum; initiatio fit per verum, nam per id instruuntur quid 
faciendum, et cum faciunt {2}id verum vocatur id bonum; ex hoc bono dein cum initiati sunt, vident vera secundum quae iterum agant; inde patet, {3} sive dicas {4}illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, sive 
illos qui in vero per quod bonum et in vero quod ex bono, idem sit. 	@1 illo I$ 	@2 illud vocatur bonum$ 	@3 i quod$ 	@4 Ecclesiam spiritualem, sive verum per quod bonum, et verum$ </p>
