<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7081节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7081.</strong>人的生命本质上是他的爱；他的爱如何，他的生命就如何；事实上，整个人就如何。然而，构成人或塑造他性格的，是他里面的主导爱，或占统治地位的爱，也就是他以之为目的的爱。这爱拥有许多源于它并从属于它的特定和具体形式的爱；尽管这些爱呈现出不同于主导爱的一个形状或外表，但主导爱仍存在于它们当中的每一个里面，指导它们，通过它们如同通过居间目的关注并对准它自己的目的，也就是首先和末后的目的。它以直接和间接两种方式做到这一切。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7081</b></p><p><b>7081.</b>
The very life of man is his love; and such as his love is, such is his life; nay, such is the whole man. But it is the ruling or reigning love, that is, the love of that which he has as the end, which 
makes the man. This love has subordinate to itself many particular and singular loves, which are derivations, and appear under a different shape; but still the ruling love is in each one of them, and 
directs them, and through them, as through mediate ends, looks to and aims at its end, which is the first and last of them all; and this both directly and indirectly. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7081</b></p><p><b>7081.</b>
A person's life consists essentially of his love, and what his love is like determines what his life, indeed his entire personality is like. It is however the dominant or ruling love in him, that is, 
his love of whatever he sees as his chief objective, that molds his character. That love has numerous particular and specific forms of love deriving from it and subordinate to it. And although these 
may take on a different appearance from the dominant love it is nevertheless present in each one. It directs them, and it employs them as intermediate objectives in looking towards and aiming at its own 
objective, which is the first and last of all. This it does in both direct and indirect ways. </p>

</p><b>7081.</b>
Ipsa vita hominis est ejus amor, et qualis est amor, talis est vita ejus, immo talis est totus homo.  Sed amor dominans seu regnans, hoc est, amor rei quae pro fine habetur, est {1}qui facit hominem; 
ille amor sibi (x)subordinatos habet plures amores particulares et singulares qui sunt derivationes, et sub alia specie apparent, sed usque {2}singulis his amor dominans inest et dirigit (c)eos, et 
per (c)eos, ut per fines medios, spectat et intendit finem suum, qui {3}est omnium primarius et ultimus; et hoc tam directe quam indirecte. 	@1 quae I$ 	@2 i in singulis illis$ 	@3 After ultimus$ </p>
