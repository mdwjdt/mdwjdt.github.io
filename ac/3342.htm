<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3342节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3342.</strong>灵人与天使也是藉着代表与其他人进行交流的。他们通过奇妙的光影变化，将自己的想法活生生地展现在与其交谈的那人的内在视觉与外在视觉面前，并通过那人情感状态的微妙变化而引入这些想法。出现这类交谈中的代表不像是以前所描述的那些，而是连同所交流的观念在一瞬间快速产生。它们就像以长长的系列来描述的某种事物，而同时这种事物却以一种形像展现在眼前。说来奇妙，一切属灵事物本身，无论是什么，都能通过远远超出人的理解范畴的各种形象以代表的形式展现出来；对真理的直觉之物，甚至更为内在的对良善的直觉之物就在这些形象中。<br />这类事物也存在于世人里面，因为世人是披着肉身的灵人。这从以事实明显可知：耳朵所感知到的一切谈话内容在朝内层上升的过程中，会逐渐变成形式或心理影像，与可见物体的形像没什么不同，并从这些形式或影像逐渐变成概念性的观念，人以这种方式逐渐理解这些话的意思。凡正确反思这些事的人都能从中知道，他的灵就在他里面，这灵就是他的内在人；还能知道脱离肉体后，他仍有交流沟通的能力，因为在世时，他就具有这种能力，尽管由于尘世、肉体和世俗事物所引发的模糊和黑暗，这种能力对他来说并不明显。</p>

All the speech of spirits and of angels is also effected by means of representatives; for by wonderful variations of light and shade they vividly present before the internal and at the same time before 
the external sight of him with whom they speak, all they are thinking about, and insinuate it by suitable changes of the state of the affections. The representations that come forth in such speech 
are not like those before described, but are quick and instantaneous, being simultaneous with the ideas that belong to their speech. They are like something that is described in a long series, while at 
the same time it is exhibited in an image before the eyes, for, wonderful to say, all spiritual things themselves whatever can be representatively exhibited by forms of imagery that are incomprehensible 
to man, within which are things of the perception of truth, and still more interiorly those of the perception of good. Such things are also in man (for man is a spirit clothed with a body); as is 
evident from the fact that all speech perceived by the ear, on ascending toward the interiors, passes into forms [ideas]* not unlike those of sight, and from these into intellectual forms or ideas, and 
thus becomes a perception of the sense of the expressions. Whoever rightly reflects upon these things may know from them that there is in himself a spirit which is his internal man, and also that after 
the separation of the body he will possess such a speech, because he is in the very same during his life in the world, although it does not appear to him that he is in it, by reason of the obscurity 
and darkness which earthly, bodily, and worldly things induce. * Here Swedenborg uses the term idea in its original Greek sense of form. Compare Doctrine of Faith n. 34 with True Christian Religion 
n. 2; and see also the note to n. 1013:4 of the present work, and n. 3216. </p>

Furthermore spirits and angels communicate everything to others by means of representatives. By means of wonderful variations of light and shade they bring their own thoughts in a vivid way before the 
internal sight and at the same time before the external sight of the one with whom they are communicating, and subtly introduce those thoughts by effecting appropriate changes in his affectional state. 
The representations manifested in their communications with others are not like those described already, but they are produced without delay and in an instant, together with the ideas conveyed in 
their communications. It is like a lengthy description of something, accompanied at the same time by the presentation before the eyes of a visual image of that thing. For amazing as it is, by means of 
varying kinds of images that are quite beyond man's comprehension any spiritual reality at all can be set forth in representative form in which inwardly there are things that go with the perception of 
truth, and still more inwardly those that go with the perception of good. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 Such things also exist within man - for man is a spirit clothed with the body - as becomes clear from the fact that when 
anything spoken that is perceived by the ear rises up towards the more interior parts, it passes into mental images not unlike those of visual objects, and from these into conceptual ideas, and in 
this way one comes to perceive the sense of the words. Anyone who reflects on these matters properly may recognize from them that within him there is his spirit, which is his internal man, and also that 
he has this kind of ability to communicate following his separation from the body, for the same ability exists with him though this is not evident to him in his lifetime because of the obscurity, 
indeed the thick darkness brought about by earthly, physical, and worldly things. </p>

Omnis loquela spirituum et angelorum etiam per repraesentativa fit; sistunt enim per mirabiles lucis et umbrae variationes illa quae cogitant, vive coram visu interno et simul externo illius cum quo 
loquuntur, et per mutationes status affectionum convenientes insinuant illa. Repraesentationes quae in loquelis existunt, non sunt similes illis de quibus prius dictum, sed sunt citae et momentaneae 
una cum ideis quae sunt loquelae illorum: sunt sicut cum describitur aliquid longa serie, et simul illud coram oculis exhibetur imagine; nam quod mirum, ipsae res spirituales quaecumque possunt per species 
imaginum quae incomprehensibiles sunt homini, repraesentative sisti, {1}in quibus intus sunt, quae perceptionis veri, et adhuc interius quae perceptionis boni sunt: [2] talia etiam in homine sunt, 
nam homo est spiritus corpore amictus; ut constare ex eo potest quod omnis loquela percepta aure cum ascendit versus interiora, transeat in ideas visualium non absimiles, et ab his in intellectuales, 
et sic fit perceptio sensus vocum: qui super his rite reflectit, inde scire potest quod in ipso spiritus sit, qui internus ejus homo est, (c)et quoque quod talis illi loquela sit post corporis separationem, 
quia in eadem est cum vivit sed non patet ei quod in illa sit, propter obscurum, immo caliginosum, quod terrestria, corporea et mundana inducunt. @1 quae intellectus veri sunt, et intus in 
illis sunt et adhuc interius, quae sunt perceptionis boni$  </p>
