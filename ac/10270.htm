<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10270节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10270</strong>.“桌子与桌子的一切器具”表在源于属天良善、属于第二层天堂的属灵良善里面，并在服务这属灵良善的良善和真理里面。这从帷帐之外的会幕、上面有脸饼或陈设饼的“桌子”和“器具”的含义清楚可知：帷帐之外的会幕，就是这桌子所在的地方，是指第二层天堂（参看<a href="9457.htm">9457</a>，<a href="9481.htm">9481</a>，<a href="9485.htm">9485</a>节）；上面有脸饼或陈设饼的“桌子”是指源于属天良善的属灵良善，因为“饼”表示属天良善（<a href="9545.htm">9545</a>节），摆放它们的“桌子”表示属灵良善（<a href="9684.htm">9684</a>，<a href="9685.htm">9685</a>节）；桌子的“器具”是指关于属天良善和真理的认知或知识（参看<a href="9544.htm">9544</a>节），因而是指服务这属灵良善的良善和真理，因为认知或知识像仆人一样事奉。这些话之所以表示源于属天良善、由上面有脸饼或陈设饼的桌子所表示的属灵良善，是因为帷帐之外的会幕代表第二层天堂，对邻之仁的良善在该层天堂掌权，被称为属灵良善，并在它拥有属天良善，也就是对主之爱的良善在里面的程度内而为良善。事实上，有三种良善构成三层天堂。被称为属天良善的对主之爱的良善构成至内层天堂；被称为属灵良善的对邻之仁的良善构成第二层天堂；被称为属灵-属世良善的信之良善构成最低层天堂。 主从祂的神性人身直接流入属于至内层天堂的属天良善；主从祂的神性人身流入属于第二层天堂的属灵良善，也间接通过属天良善流入；主从祂的神性人身流入属于最低层天堂的属灵-属世良善，又再次间接流入。之所以说“也间接”，是因为主不仅间接，还直接流入这些天堂的良善，这一点从前面关于神性流注，无论直接还是间接的说明可以看出来（<a href="9682.htm">9682</a>节提到的地方）。</p>

And the table, and all the vessels thereof. That this signifies in spiritual good from the celestial, which belongs to the second heaven, and in the ministering goods and truths, is evident from the 
signification of "the Tent of meeting outside the veil," where was this table, as being the second heaven (see n. 9457, 9481, 9485); from the signification of "the table upon which were the breads of 
faces," as being spiritual good from the celestial; for the "breads" signify celestial good (n. 9545); and the "table" upon which these were signifies spiritual good (n. 9684, 9685); and from the signification 
of its "vessels," as being the knowledges of celestial good and truth (see n. 9544), thus ministering goods and truths, for knowledges minister. The reason why these words signify spiritual 
good from the celestial (which is signified by "the table upon which were the breads of faces"), is that by the Tent of meeting outside the veil was represented the second heaven, in which reigns the 
good of charity toward the neighbor, which is called spiritual good, and this good is so far good as there is in it celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord. For there are three kinds of 
good which make the three heavens. There is the good of love to the Lord, which is called celestial good; this makes the inmost heaven. There is the good of charity toward the neighbor, which is called 
spiritual good, and which makes the second heaven. And there is the good of faith, which is called spiritual natural good, and makes the ultimate heaven. The Lord inflows immediately from His Divine 
Human into the celestial good which is of the inmost heaven. The Lord inflows from the Divine Human into the spiritual good which is of the second heaven, and also mediately through celestial good. And 
the Lord inflows from the Divine Human into the spiritual natural good, which is of the ultimate heaven, and again also mediately. It is said "also mediately," because the Lord not only flows into 
the goods of these heavens mediately, but also immediately (as can be seen from what was shown concerning Divine influx immediate and mediate in the numbers cited in n. 9682). </p>

'And the table and all its vessels' means within spiritual good springing from celestial, which belongs to the second heaven, and within the forms of good and the truths which are of service to that 
spiritual good. This is clear from the meaning of the tent of meeting outside the veil, where that table stood, as the second heaven, dealt with in <a href="9457.htm">9457</a>, <a href="9481.htm">9481</a>, <a href="9485.htm">9485</a>; from the meaning of 'the table', on 
which the loaves of the Presence were laid, as spiritual good springing from celestial, for celestial good is meant by 'the loaves', <a href="9545.htm">9545</a>, and spiritual good by 'the table' on which they were laid, <a href="9684.htm">9684</a>, <a href="9685.htm">9685</a>; and from the meaning of 'its vessels' as cognitions or knowledge of celestial good and truth, dealt with in <a href="9544.htm">9544</a>, and so the forms of good and the truths of service to that spiritual good 
since cognitions act as servants. The reason why spiritual good springing from celestial is what 'the table', on which the loaves of the Presence were laid, means is that the tent of meeting outside the 
veil represented the second heaven, in which the good of charity towards the neighbour reigns. This good is called spiritual good, and is good in the measure that it has celestial good, which is the 
good of love to the Lord, within it. For there are three kinds of good that compose the three heavens. There is the good of love to the Lord, called celestial good, composing the inmost heaven; there 
is the good of charity towards the neighbour, called spiritual good, composing the second heaven; and there is the good of faith, called spiritual-natural good, composing the lowest heaven. Into the 
celestial good belonging to the inmost heaven the Lord flows from His Divine Human directly; into the spiritual good belonging to the second heaven the Lord flows from His Divine Human, and indirectly 
as well through the celestial good; and into the spiritual-natural good belonging to the lowest heaven the Lord flows from His Divine Human, and again indirectly as well. The expression indirectly as 
well is used because the Lord flows not only indirectly but also directly into these heavens' kinds of good, as may be recognized from what has been shown regarding Divine influx, direct and indirect, 
in the places referred to in <a href="9682.htm">9682</a>.  </p>

`Et mensam et omnia vasa ejus': quod significet in bono spirituali {1} ex caelesti, quod secundi caeli, (c)ac in bonis et veris ministrantibus, constat ex significatione `tentorii conventus extra velum, 
ubi mensa illa' quod sit caelum secundum, de qua n. 9457, 9481, 9485, ex significatione `mensae super qua panes facierum' quod sit bonum spirituale ex caelesti, `panes' enim significant bonum caeleste, 
n. 9545, et `mensa' super qua illi bonum spirituale, n. 9684, 9685, et ex significatione `vasorum ejus' quod sint cognitiones boni et veri caelestis, de qua n. 9544, ita bona et vera ministrantia, 
nam cognitiones ministrant. Quod sit bonum spirituale ex caelesti quod significatur per `mensam super qua panes facierum' est quia per tentorium conventus extra velum repraesentatum est caelum secundum, 
in quo bonum charitatis erga proximum regnat, quod bonum vocatur bonum spirituale, et hoc bonum tantum est bonum, quantum in eo est bonum caeleste, quod est bonum amoris in Dominum; sunt enim tria 
genera bonorum quae faciunt tres caelos; est bonum amoris in Dominum, quod vocatur bonum caeleste, hoc facit intimum caelum; {2}est bonum charitatis erga proximum, quod vocatur bonum spirituale, {3}et 
facit secundum caelum; et est bonum fidei, quod vocatur bonum naturale spirituale, hoc facit ultimum caelum; in bonum caeleste, quod est intimi caeli, influit Dominus ex Divino Humano immediate; 
in bonum spirituale, quod est secundi caeli, influit Dominus ex Divino Humano, etiam mediate per bonum caeleste; et in bonum naturale spirituale, quod est ultimi caeli, influit Dominus ex Divino Humano,
