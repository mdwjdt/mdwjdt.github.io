<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第989节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>989.</strong>至于战胜虚假，这与战胜邪恶的情形一样，即人凭自己根本战胜不了虚假。由于此处的主题是重生之人战胜恶欲，即“地上的牲畜”，和虚假，即“空中的飞鸟”，故应清醒地认识到，没人能说他已重生了，除非他承认并相信仁是构成其信的首要之物，并且他被感动去爱和怜悯他的邻舍。他的新意愿正是通过仁爱形成，主也正是经由仁爱，而非无仁之信运行源于仁爱的良善和真理。有些人实践仁爱行为仅仅出于服从，即因为这是主所要求的，他们也未重生。只要不在行为中妄行正义，这些人在来生会重生。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]989.</strong> In regard to mastery over falsities, it is like mastery over evil; that is to say, we have not the least ability to overcome false thinking on our own.<br />The discussion here is about the mastery regenerate people exercise over their corrupt desires (the beast of the earth) and their falsities (the bird of the sky). In view of this, it needs to be known that we have no right at all to say we have regenerated until we acknowledge and believe that charity is the most important part of our faith and until we feel love for our fellow humans and show mercy to them. Love for others forms the regenerate person's new will. Love for others — and not faith devoid of love — is the means by which the Lord does good in the world and puts the resulting truth to work.<br />Some people do acts of kindness purely out of obedience, because the Lord commanded it, even though they are not regenerate. If they avoid the attitude that good deeds make us righteous, they regenerate in the other life. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 989</b></p><p><b>989.</b>
As regards dominion over falsities, it is the same as with dominion over evils: man cannot of himself have the least dominion over them. Since the subject here is the dominion of the regenerated man 
over cupidities, or the "beast of the earth" and over falsities, or the "bird of heaven" it is to be known that no one can ever say that he is regenerate unless he acknowledges and believes that charity 
is the primary thing of his faith, and unless he is affected with love toward the neighbor, and has mercy on him. Of charity his new will is formed. Through charity the Lord brings about good, and 
thereby truth, but not through faith without charity. There are some who perform works of charity from obedience alone, that is, because it is so commanded by the Lord, and yet are not regenerate. These 
if they do not place righteousness in their works are regenerated in the other life. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 989</b></p><p><b>989.</b>
As regards ruling over falsities the same applies as with ruling over evils, namely that of himself no one is able in the slightest to rule over falsity. Since the subject here is the regenerate person' 
s rule over evil desires, which are 'the beast of the earth' and over falsities, which are 'the bird of the air',<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> it should be recognized that nobody can possibly say he has been regenerated unless 
he acknowledges and believes that charity is the primary constituent of his faith and unless he is moved to love his neighbour and pity him. It is from charity that his new will is formed, and it is 
by means of charity that the Lord works good and truth deriving from it, and not by means of faith devoid of charity. There are people who practise the works of charity solely out of a sense of obedience, 
that is, because it has been so commanded by the Lord, but who are nevertheless not regenerate. Provided they do not presume any righteousness to lie in their works, these people are regenerated 
in the next life.

</p><b>989.</b>
Quod dominium super falsa attinet, similiter se habet ac dominium super mala, quod nempe homo ne minimum ex se dominari queat super falsum: hic quia agitur de dominio hominis regenerati super cupiditates 
seu 'bestiam terrae,' et super falsitates seu 'avem caeli,' sciendum quod nusquam aliquis dicere possit quod regeneratus sit, nisi agnoscat et credat quod charitas sit primarium ejus fidei et nisi 
afficiatur amore erga proximum et misereatur ejus. Ex charitate formatur ejus nova voluntas; per charitatem operatur Dominus bonum et inde verum, non autem per fidem absque charitate. Sunt qui ex sola 
oboedientia exercent charitatis opera, hoc est, quia ita mandatum est a Domino, et usque non regenerati sunt; hi, si non in operibus ponunt justitiam, in altera vita regenerantur. </p>
