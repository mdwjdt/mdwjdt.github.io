<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1365.</strong>创世记11:28. 哈兰死在他父亲他拉的面前，死在他的出生地迦勒底的吾珥。<br />“哈兰死在他父亲他拉的面前，死在他的出生地迦勒底的吾珥”表内在敬拜被抹除，完全变成了偶像崇拜，“哈兰”表内在的偶像崇拜，“他父亲他拉”和前面一样，表总体上的偶像崇拜，“他的出生地”表它所起源的源头，“迦勒底的吾珥”表含有虚假的外在敬拜。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1365.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1365/bible_king-james-version_genesis_11_28" target=_top>Genesis 11:28</a>. And Haran died in the presence of Terah, his father, in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans.<br />Haran died in the presence of Terah, his father, in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans, means that deeper worship was obliterated and became purely idolatrous. Haran symbolizes deeper idolatrous worship; Terah, his father, symbolizes idolatrous worship in general, as before; the land of his birth symbolizes the source from which it developed. Ur of the Chaldeans symbolizes outward worship that involves falsities. </p>

Verse 28. And Haran died upon the faces of Terah his father, in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees. "And Haran died upon the faces of Terah his father, in the land of his nativity, in Ur 
of the Chaldees," signifies that interior worship was blotted out and became merely idolatrous; by "Haran" is signified interior idolatrous worship; by "Terah his father," as before, idolatrous worship 
in general; by "the land of his nativity," the origin whence it was derived; by "Ur of the Chaldees," external worship in which there are falsities. </p>

Verse 28 And Haran died in the presence<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of Terah his father, in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans. </p>
<p>'Haran died in the presence' of Terah his father, in the land of his birth, in Ur of 
the Chaldeans' means that interior worship was erased and became wholly idolatrous, 'Haran' meaning interior idolatrous worship, 'Terah his father', as previously, meaning idolatrous worship in general, 
'land of his birth' the source from which it derived, and 'Ur of the Chaldeans' external worship containing falsities.

Vers. 28. Et mortuus est Haran super facies Terahi, patris sui, in terra nativitatis suae in Ur Chaldaeorum. 'Mortuus est Haran super facies Terahi, patris sui, in terra nativitatis suae, in Ur Chaldaeorum' 
significat quod interior cultus obliteratus sit et factus mere idololatricus; per 'Haran' significatur cultus idololatricus interior; per 'Terahum patrem ejus,' ut prius, cultus idololatricus 
in genere; per 'terram nativitatis' origo unde derivatus; per 'Ur Chaldaeorum' significatur cultus externus in quo falsa. </p>
