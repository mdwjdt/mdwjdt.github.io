<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6058.</strong>但流注具有这样的性质：它始于主的神性，并进入每位天使、每个灵人和每个世人；主以这种方式不仅在总体上，还在最小细节上掌管每个人。祂不仅直接从祂自己，还间接通过灵界如此行。为使这种流注的性质为人所知，我们已经大量阐述了人的各个部位与大人，即天堂的对应关系；同时大量阐述了属灵实物在属世事物中的代表。我们在23-43章末尾论述了这些事；后来在44和45章末尾阐述了与人同在的天使并灵人，现在接着阐述流注，以及灵魂与身体的相互作用这个主题。不过，该主题必须通过经历来说明；否则，因着猜测而如此不为人知并变得如此模糊的这个主题无法被带入光明。我们将在以下几章末尾阐述这些用来说明的经历。目前所说的这些不能算作这些经历的引子。</p>

But influx is of such a nature that there is an influx from the Divine of the Lord into every angel, into every spirit, and into every man, and that in this way the Lord rules everyone, not only in the 
universal, but also in the veriest singulars, and this immediately from Himself, and also mediately through the spiritual world. In order to make known the existence of this influx, much has already 
been said about the correspondence of man's parts with the Grand Man, that is, with heaven; and at the same time about the representation of spiritual things in natural; at the close of chapters 23 
to 43, and afterward about the angels and spirits with man, at the close of chapters 44 and 45; and this is now to be followed with a specific exposition of the subject of influx and the interaction of 
the soul and the body. But this subject must be illustrated by experiences, for otherwise things so much unknown and rendered so obscure by hypotheses cannot be brought forth into the light. The illustrative 
experiences shall be presented at the close of some of the following chapters. Let what has been said thus far serve as an introduction.       </p>
<p>     Genesis 47 </p>
<p>     1. And Joseph came 
and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, have come out of the land of Canaan; and behold they are in the land of Goshen.      
2. And from among his brethren he took five men, and set them before Pharaoh.      3. And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What are your works? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are a shepherd 
of the flock, both we and our fathers.      4. And they said unto Pharaoh, To sojourn in the land have we come; for there is no pasture for thy servants' flock; for the famine is grievous in the land 
of Canaan; and now I pray let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.      5. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren have come unto thee: </p>
<p>     6. The land of Egypt before 
thee is it; in the best of the land make thy father and thy brethren dwell; let them dwell in the land of Goshen; and if thou knowest, and there be among them, men of activity, then set them as princes 
over my cattle.      7. And Joseph brought Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.      8. And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How many are the days of the years of thy 
life?      9. And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my sojournings are a hundred and thirty years; few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained 
to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their sojournings.      10. And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.      11. And Joseph made his father and his 
brethren dwell, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.      12. And Joseph sustained his father, and his brethren, 
and all his father's house, with bread, according to the mouth of the babe.      13. And there was no bread in all the land; because the famine was very grievous, and the land of Egypt and the land 
of Canaan labored by reason of the famine.      14. And Joseph gathered together all the silver that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the produce which they bought; and 
Joseph brought the silver into Pharaoh's house.      15. And when the silver was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all Egypt came unto Joseph, saying, Give us bread; for why 
should we die beside thee because the silver faileth?      16. And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if silver fail.      17. And they brought their cattle unto 
Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread [in exchange] for the horses, and for the cattle of the flock, and for the cattle of the herd, and for the asses; and he provided them with bread [in exchange] for all 
their cattle in this year.      18. And when this year was ended, they came unto him in the second year, and said to him, We will not hide from my lord how that the silver is spent; and the herd of 
the beast is to my lord; there is naught left before my lord besides our body and our ground.      19. Wherefore should we die before thine eyes, both we and our ground? buy us and our ground for bread, 
and we shall live, and our ground, servants to Pharaoh; and give seed, that we may live, and not die, and the ground be not laid waste.      20. And Joseph bought all the ground of Egypt for Pharaoh; 
for the Egyptians sold everyone his field, because the famine grew strong upon them; and the land was Pharaoh's.      21. And as for the people, he removed it to the cities from one end of the 
border of Egypt even to the other end thereof.      22. Only the ground of the priests bought he not; because a portion was appointed for the priests by Pharaoh, and they ate their appointed portion 
which Pharaoh had given them; wherefore they sold not their ground.      23. And Joseph said unto the people, Behold I have bought you this day and your ground for Pharaoh; lo here is seed for you, 
and ye shall sow the ground.      24. And it shall be in the in-gatherings that ye shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts shall be for you, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them 
in your houses, and for food for your babes.      25. And they said, Thou hast made us live; let us find grace in the eyes of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.      26. And Joseph made 
it a statute even unto this day, concerning the ground of Egypt, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the ground of the priests, only theirs, was not Pharaoh's.      27. And Israel dwelt in the land 
of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they had a possession therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.      28. And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; so the days of Jacob, 
the years of his life, were seven years, and a hundred and forty years.      29. And the days of Israel drew near to die; and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If I pray I have found grace 
in thine eyes, put I pray thy hand under my thigh, and do mercy and truth with me; bury me not I pray in Egypt.      30. And I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and 
bury me in their sepulcher. And he said, I will do according to thy word.      31. And he said, Swear to me: and he sware to him. Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head. </p>

But the nature of the inflowing is such that it begins in the Lord's Divine Being and passes into every angel, every spirit, and every man, and in this way the Lord governs everyone not only in an overall 
sense but also in the smallest details. He does so both directly from Himself and indirectly through the spiritual world. So that the existence of this inflowing may be known much has been stated 
already regarding the correspondence of the parts of the human being with the Grand Man, that is, with heaven, and at the same time regarding the representation of spiritual realities with natural things. 
These matters were dealt with at the ends of Chapters <a href="23.htm">23</a>-<a href="43.htm">43</a>. After that the subject, the angels and spirits present with a person, was dealt with at the ends of Chapters <a href="44.htm">44</a> and <a href="45.htm">45</a>. It now follows 
that the specific matters of influx and the interaction of the soul and the body should be dealt with. But they are matters that need to have the light of experience thrown on them, otherwise a subject 
about which people are so ignorant and which they place in the dark by conjecturing about it cannot be brought out into the light. Experiences that throw light on these matters will be related at 
the ends of several chapters following this. What has been stated so far may serve instead of an introduction to those experiences. </p>

Sed influxus est talis quod a Divino Domini sit influxus in omnem angelum, in omnem spiritum, et in omnem hominem, et quod sic Dominus regat unumquemvis non solum in universali sed etiam in singularissimis, 
et hoc immediate a Se Ipso, et quoque mediate per mundum spiritualem.  Ut sciatur quod ille influxus sit, plura praemissa sunt de correspondentia partium hominis cum Maximo Homine, hoc est, cum 
caelo, et simul ibi de repraesentatione spiritualium in naturalibus, de quibus ad finem capitum xxiii ad xliii; et dein de angelis et spiritibus apud hominem, ad finem capitum xliv et xlv.  Sequitur

this chapter and its explanations are missing from A.  The endorsement of the preceding chapter is Geneseos Caput xlvii, n. 5994 ad 6058, but xlvii is altered to xlvi.$ 1.  Et venit Joseph, et indicavit 
Pharaoni, et dixit, Pater meus et fratres mei, et greges eorum et armenta eorum, et omnia quae illis, venerunt e terra Canaan, et ecce illi in terra Goshen.  2.  Et e parte fratrum suorum accepit 
quinque viros, et statuit illos coram Pharaone. 3.  Et dixit Pharaoh ad fratres ejus, Quid opera vestra? et dixerunt ad Pharaonem, Pastor gregis servi tui, etiam nos, etiam patres nostri. 4.  Et dixerunt 
ad Pharaonem, Ad peregrinandum in terra venimus, quia nullum pascuum gregi qui servis tuis, quia gravis fames in terra Canaan, et nunc habitent quaeso servi tui in terra Goshen. 5.  Et dixit Pharaoh 
ad Josephum, dicendo, Pater tuus et fratres tui venerunt ad te. 6.  Terra Aegypti coram te haec, in optimo terrae habitare fac patrem tuum et fratres tuos, habitent in terra Goshen; et si nosti, 
et sit in illis viri strenuitatis, et ponas illos principes pecoris super quod mihi. 7.  Et venire fecit Joseph Jacobum patrem suum, et statuit illum coram Pharaone; et benedixit Jacob Pharaoni. 8. 
 Et dixit Pharaoh ad Jacobum, Quot dies annorum vitae tuae? 9.  Et dixit Jacob ad Pharaonem, Dies annorum peregrinationum mearum triginta et centum anni; parum et mali fuerunt dies annorum vitae meae, 
et non attigerunt dies annorum vitae patrum meorum, in diebus peregrinationum illorum. 10.  Et benedixit Jacob Pharaoni, et egressus a coram Pharaone.  11.  Et habitare fecit Joseph patrem suum 
et fratres suos, et dedit illis possessionem in terra Aegypti in optimo terrae, in terra Rameses, quemadmodum praecepit Pharaoh.  12.  Et sustentavit Joseph patrem suum et fratres suos, et totam domum 
patris sui pane ad os infantis.  13.  Et panis nullus in omni terra, quia gravis fames valde, et laborabat terra Aegypti et terra Canaan a coram fame. 14.  Et collegit Joseph omne argentum inventum 
in terra Aegypti et in terra Canaan, in annona, quam illi ementes, et venire fecit Joseph argentum domum Pharaonis. 15.  Et consumptum argentum e terra Aegypti et e terra Canaan, et venerunt omnis 
Aegyptus ad Josephum, dicendo, Da nobis panem, et cur moriemur juxta te, quia deficit argentum? 16.  Et dixit Joseph, Date pecora vestra, et dabo vobis in pecoribus vestris, si (x)deficit argentum. 17. 
 Et venire fecerunt pecora sua ad Josephum, et dedit illis Joseph panem pro equis, et pro pecore gregis, et pro pecore armenti, et pro asinis, et providit illos pane pro omni pecore eorum, in anno 
hoc. 18.  Et finitus annus hic, et venerunt ad illum in anno altero, et dixerunt ei, Non celabimus a domino, siquidem consumptum argentum, et pecus bestiae, ad dominum, non relictum coram domino praeter 
quam corpus nostrum et humus nostra. 19.  Quare moriemur ad oculos tuos, etiam nos, etiam humus nostra? eme nos et humum nostram pro pane, et vivemus nos et humus nostra servi Pharaoni, et da semen, 
et vivamus et non moriamur, et humus non vastata sit. 20.  Et emit Joseph omnem humum Aegypti Pharaoni, quia vendiderunt Aegyptii quisque agrum suum, quoniam invaluit super illos fames; et fuit 
terra Pharaoni. 21.  Et populum transtulit illum ad urbes a fine termini Aegypti et ad finem illius. 22.  Solum humum sacerdotum non emit, quia pars statuta sacerdotibus a Pharaone, et comederunt partem 
statutam suam, quam dederat illis Pharaoh, propterea non vendiderunt humum suam. 23.  Et dixit Joseph ad populum, Ecce emi vos hodie, et humum vestram, Pharaoni, en vobis semen, et seratis humum. 24. 
 Et erit, in proventibus et dabitis quintam Pharaoni, et quatuor partes erit vobis ad semen agri, et ad cibum vestrum, et illis in domibus vestris, et ad cibum infantibus vestris. 25.  Et dixerunt, 
Vivificasti nos, inveniamus gratiam in oculis domini, et erimus servi Pharaoni. 26.  Et posuit illud Joseph ad statutum usque ad diem hunc super humum Aegypti Pharaoni ad quintam; solum humus 
sacerdotum, tantum illorum non fuit Pharaoni. 27.  Et habitavit Israel in terra Aegypti, in terra Goshen, et possessionem habuerunt in illa; et fructificarunt se, et multiplicati valde. 28.  Et dixit 
Jacob in terra Aegypti septendecim annis; et fuit dies Jacobi anni vitae illius septem anni et quadraginta et centum anni. 29.  Et appropinquaverunt dies Israelis ad moriendum, et vocavit filium suum 
Josephum, et dixit ei, Si quaeso inveni gratiam in oculis tuis, pone quaeso manum tuam sub femore meo, et facias mecum misericordiam et veritatem, ne quaeso sepelias me in Aegypto.  30.  Et cubem 
cum patribus meis, et feras me ex Aegypto, et sepelias me in sepulcro illorum; et dixit, Ego faciam secundum verbum tuum. 31.  Et dixit, Jura mihi; et juravit ei; et incurvavit se Israel super caput lecti. </p>
