<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2905节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2905.</strong>“一百二十七岁”表它们的完结。这从“一百”、“二十”和“七”的含义清楚可知：“一百”是指完满之物（参看<a href="2636.htm">2636</a>节）；“二十”或十的两倍也是指完满之物（参看<a href="1988.htm">1988</a>节）；“七”是指神圣之物（参看<a href="395.htm">395</a>，<a href="433.htm">433</a>，<a href="716.htm">716</a>，<a href="881.htm">881</a>节）。它是指此处所表示的教会所属神圣之物的完结或终结。在圣言中，所有数字都表示真实事物（参看<a href="482.htm">482</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="647.htm">647</a>，<a href="648.htm">648</a>，<a href="755.htm">755</a>，<a href="813.htm">813</a>，<a href="1963.htm">1963</a>，<a href="1988.htm">1988</a>，<a href="2075.htm">2075</a>，<a href="2252.htm">2252</a>节）。<br />它们的完结，也就是教会的状态和时间的完结表示它们的终结。因为教会所经历的各个阶段就好比人的各个年龄段。第一个年龄段是童年，第二个是青少年，第三个是成年，第四个是老年；这最后一个年龄段，即老年就被称为完结或终结。教会的各个阶段还好比一年的各个季节和状态，第一个季节是春季，第二个是夏季，第三个是秋季，第四个是冬季；这最后一个季节就是一年的终结。教会的各个阶段又好比一天当中的各个时间段和状态，第一个时间段是黎明，第二个是正午，第三个是傍晚，第四个是夜间；这最后一个时间段就是一天的完结或终结。在圣言中，教会的各个状态被比作人的各个年龄段，一年四季，一日四时，并由它们来表示，因为时间就表示状态（参看<a href="2625.htm">2625</a>，<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="2837.htm">2837</a>节）。<br />那些属教会的人所具有的良善与真理便以这种方式减少。当良善与真理荡然无存，或如前所述，当信荡然无存，也就是说仁荡然无存时，教会就迈入老年，或冬天，或夜晚。这个时间和状态被称为结局、终结和完结（参看<a href="1857.htm">1857</a>节）。关于在时代的完结，或结局到来时降世的经文就具有相同的含义，因为那时，良善，甚至连属世之善，因而真理都荡然无存了。这就是本节经文所说这些事的具体含义。</p>

A hundred years and twenty years and seven years. That this signifies their fullness, is evident from the signification of a "hundred," as being what is full (see n. 2636); and of "twenty," or twice 
ten, as being also what is full (see n. 1988); and of "seven," as being what is holy (see n. 395, 433, 716, 881); thus it is the fullness or the end of what is holy belonging to the church that is here 
signified. (That numbers in the Word all signify things, may be seen above, n. 482, 487, 647, 648, 755, 813, 1963, 1988, 2075, 2252.) [2] Their fullness, that is, the fullness of the states and times 
of the church, signifies their end; for the case with the church is like that of the ages of man, of which the first is childhood, the second youth, the third adult age, the fourth old age; the last, 
or old age, being called the fullness or end. It is also like the times and states of the year; of which the first is spring, the second summer, the third autumn, and the fourth winter; and this last 
is the end of the year. It is also like the times and states of the day, the first of which is dawn, the second noon, the third evening, and the fourth night; and when this has come, there is fullness 
or the end. To all these are the states of the church compared in the Word, and they are signified by the same; for by times are signified states (see n. 2625, 2788, 2837). [3] The good and truth 
with those who are of the church are wont to decrease in this manner; and when there are no longer any good and truth (or as is said, when there is no longer any faith, that is, no charity) then the 
church has come to its old age, or its winter, or its night; and its time and state then are called "decision," "consummation," and "fulfillment" (see n. 1857). The same is signified when it is said of 
the Lord that He came into the world in the fullness of times, or when there was fullness; for there was then no longer any good, not even natural good; and consequently there was no truth. These are 
the things specifically signified by what is said in this verse. </p>

'A hundred and twenty-seven years' means their completion. This is clear from the meaning of 'a hundred' as that which is complete, dealt with in <a href="2636.htm">2636</a>, and from the meaning of 'twenty' also, which is 
twice ten, as that which is complete, <a href="1988.htm">1988</a>, and from the meaning of 'seven' as that which is holy, <a href="395.htm">395</a>, <a href="433.htm">433</a>, <a href="716.htm">716</a>, <a href="881.htm">881</a>. Thus it is the completion or conclusion of the holy state of the Church that is 
meant here. For all numbers in the Word mean real things, see <a href="482.htm">482</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="647.htm">647</a>, <a href="648.htm">648</a>, <a href="755.htm">755</a>, <a href="813.htm">813</a>, <a href="1963.htm">1963</a>, <a href="1988.htm">1988</a>, <a href="2075.htm">2075</a>, <a href="2252.htm">2252</a>. The completion of them, that is to say, of the states and periods of time of the Church, 
means their conclusion. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The Church passes through different phases that are like the ages of man. The first of these is early childhood, the second youth, the third adult years, and the fourth 
old age. The last of these - old age - is called the completion or conclusion. The phases of the Church are also like the times and seasons of the year, the first of which is spring, the second summer, 
the third autumn, and the fourth winter. The last of these is the conclusion of the year. The phases of the Church are also like the times and divisions of the day, the first being the dawn, the 
second midday, the third evening, and the fourth night. The last of these is the completion or conclusion of the day. In the Word too the states of the Church are compared to the ages of man, the seasons 
of the year, and the divisions of the day, and are meant there by the same because periods of time mean states, <a href="2625.htm">2625</a>, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="2837.htm">2837</a>. Good and truth with those who belong to the Church usually diminish 
in this fashion. And when good and truth do not exist any longer, or, as is said, when faith does not exist any longer, that is to say, when charity does not exist any longer, the Church has reached 
its old age, or its winter, or its night. And that period of time or state is called the settlement, close, and fulfilment, see <a href="1857.htm">1857</a>. Statements about the Lord coming into the world in the fullness 
of time, or when completion had been reached, have the same meaning, for at that time no good existed any longer, not even natural good, nor consequently any truth. This is the specific meaning of the 
things stated in this verse. </p>

`Centum anni et viginti anni et septem anni':  quod significet plenitudinem illorum, constat a significatione `centum' quod sit plenum, de qua n. 2636, et a `viginti' seu his decem, quod etiam plenum, 
n. 1988, et a `septem' quod sanctum, n. 395, 433, 716, 881, ita quod sit plenitudo seu finis sancti Ecclesiae qui hic significatur; quod numeri in Verbo omnes significent res, videatur n. 482, 487, 
647, 648, 755, 813, 1963, 1988, 2075, 2252.  Plenitudo illorum, nempe statuum et temporum Ecclesiae, significat finem eorum; [2] Ecclesia se habet sicut aetates hominis, quarum prima est infantia, altera 
est adolescentia, tertia est adulta aetas, quarta est senectus; haec, nempe senectus, dicitur plenitudo seu finis; etiam se habet sicut tempora et status anni, quorum primus est ver, alter est aestas, 
tertius est autumnus, et quartus est hiems; haec est finis anni; se habet etiam sicut tempora et status diei, primus est aurorae, alter est meridiei, tertius est vesperae, et quartus est noctis; 
cum haec, est plenitudo seu finis:  illis et his quoque in Verbo status Ecclesiae comparantur, et per eosdem significantur quia per `tempora' significantur status, n. 2625, 2788, 2837.  Bonum et verum 
apud illos qui sunt ab Ecclesia, ita solet decrescere; et cum nullum amplius bonam et verum, seu, ut dicitur, nulla amplius fides, hoc est, nulla charitas, tunc Ecclesia ad suam senectutem, seu ad suam 
hiemem, seu ad suam noctem, pervenit, et dicitur ejus tempus et status tunc decisio, consummatio, et impletio, videatur n. 1857.  Quod de Domino dicatur quod venerit in mundum in plenitudine temporum, 
seu cum plenitudo, idem significat, nam tunc non amplius fuit aliquod bonum, ne quidem bonum naturale, inde nec aliquod verum:  haec sunt quae in specie significantur per haec quae in hoc versu. </p>
