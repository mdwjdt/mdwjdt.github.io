<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">第14章  关于灵人和天使的言语</h4><br />1634.由主的圣言可知，以前有很多人与灵人、天使对话，他们耳闻目睹了很多来世的事物；但后来天堂仿佛关闭了，因为如今几乎没人相信灵人和天使的存在，更不用说世人能与他们对话这种事了；人们认为与不可见的人，以及与那些他们发自内心否认的人对话是不可能的。但蒙主怜悯，如今我被许可与灵人并天使交谈已有数年，几乎从未间断，并与他们来往，如同他们当中的一员，所以我能讲述我得以了解到的他们彼此间的这种言语。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1634.</strong> THE Lord's Word makes it clear that many people used to talk with spirits and angels, and that they heard and saw much in the other world, but that heaven was later shut, so to speak. It was closed so tightly that today hardly anyone believes spirits and angels exist, let alone that anyone can talk with them. To most people's way of thinking, speech with invisible beings (whose existence they deny at heart) is impossible.<br />In the Lord's divine mercy, however, I have been granted the almost continuous opportunity for several years now to hold conversations with them and to go among them as one of them.{*1} Let me report here, then, what I have had the privilege of learning about the way they talk to each other.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For more details on the dates of Swedenborg's spiritual awakening, see note 1 in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1634/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5" target=_top>5</a>.

CHAPTER 14 CONCERNING THE SPEECH OF SPIRITS AND ANGELS It is known from the Word of the Lord that many persons formerly spoke with spirits and angels, and that they heard and saw many things that are 
in the other life; but that afterwards heaven was as it were shut, insomuch that at the present day the existence of spirits and angels is scarcely credited, and still less that anyone can speak with 
them; for men regard it as impossible to speak with the unseen, and with those whose existence they in their hearts deny. But as of the Lord's Divine mercy I have now for some years been permitted 
to hold converse with spirits and angels almost continually, and to be in companionship with them as one of themselves, I may now relate what it has been given me to learn concerning their speech with 
one another. </p>

<p>THE SPEECH OF SPIRITS AND ANGELS </p>
<p>It is well known from the Word of the Lord that many in former times spoke to spirits and angels, and that those people heard and saw many things that exist 
in the next life; but that after those times heaven was so to speak closed, so completely that at the present day there is scarcely any belief in the existence of spirits and angels, let alone in anyone 
being able to talk to them. For people today suppose that to talk to those who cannot be seen, and to those whose existence they deny in their hearts, is an impossibility. But since in the Lord's Divine 
mercy I have been allowed for some years now almost constantly to hold conversations with them and to enjoy their fellowship as one among them, let me now relate what I have been given to know about 
their speech with one another </p>

GENESEOS 					CAPUT DECIMUM QUARTUM 				De Loquela Spirituum et Angelorum </p>
<p>Notum est ex Verbo Domini quod plures olim locuti sint cum spiritibus et angelis quodque audiverint 
et viderint plura quae in altera vita; sed quod postea quasi clausum sit caelum, usque adeo ut hodie vix credatur quod spiritus et angeli sint, minus quod aliquis cum illis loqui possit, putante' 
quod loqui cum inconspicuis, et quos in corde suo negant, sit impossibile: sed quia, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, concessum est inibi nunc per aliquot annos paene continue sociare cum illis sermones, 
et cum illis in consortio esse sicut unus eorum, quid de loquela illorum inter se scire datum est, licet nunc referre. </p>
