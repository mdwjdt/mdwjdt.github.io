<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10698节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10698</strong>.“随后，以色列众人都近前来”表所有兴趣在于没有内在事物的外在事物，然而又代表内在事物的人。这从“以色列人”的代表清楚可知，“以色列人”是指那些兴趣在于没有内在之物的外在事物之人，如刚才所述（<a href="10692.htm">10692</a>节）。之所以也表示那些代表内在事物的人，是因为摩西为这个民族赢得许可，即：该民族可以代表教会，即便他们具有这样的性质：教会不可能建立在他们中间。教会不可能建立在那些兴趣在于没有内在之物的外在事物的人中间，因为教会在人的内在里面，不在没有这内在的外在里面。事实上，人通过内在与天堂和主相联系；当这内在不存在时，也就是说，当它被关闭时，他就与地狱相联系。不过，尽管以色列人具有这种性质：他们不可能通过内在与天堂发生任何联系，但他们仍能代表诸如属于教会和天堂的那类事物。这一切唯独通过与内在事物相对应的外在事物实现。也正因如此，他们被接纳。这个民族当中没有教会，只有一个教会的代表（可参看<a href="9320.htm">9320</a>e，<a href="10396.htm">10396</a>节提到的地方）；与天堂的联系通过代表内在事物的外在事物实现（可参看<a href="9320.htm">9320</a>e，<a href="10396.htm">10396</a>节提到的地方，以及<a href="10492.htm">10492</a>，<a href="10500.htm">10500</a>，<a href="10549.htm">10549</a>-<a href="10551.htm">10551</a>，<a href="10570.htm">10570</a>，<a href="10575.htm">10575</a>，<a href="10602.htm">10602</a>，<a href="10629.htm">10629</a>节）。</p>

And afterward all the sons of Israel came near. That this signifies all who were in external things without what is internal and yet represented internal things, is evident from the representation of 
the sons of Israel, as being those who are in external things without what is internal (of which just above, n. 10692). That it also signifies those who represented internal things, is because Moses 
obtained permission for the church to be represented among that nation, although they were of such a character that no church could be instituted among them. For there can be no church among those who 
are in external things without what is internal, because the church is in the internal of man, and not in the external without this; for man's communication with heaven and with the Lord is through the 
internal. When there is no internal, that is, when it has been closed, there is then communication with hell. But although the sons of Israel were of such a character that no communication of heaven 
with them was possible through the internal, nevertheless they could represent such things as were of the church and of heaven, which is effected solely by means of external things to which internal 
things correspond, and for this reason they were received. (That with that nation there was not a church, but only the representative of a church, may be seen at the places cited in n. 9320, 10396; and 
that communication with heaven was effected by means of external things that represented internal things, may be seen at the places cited in n. 9320, 10396; also n. 10492, 10500, 10549-10551, 10570, 
10575, 10602, 10629.) </p>

'And afterwards all the children of Israel approached' means all who, although their interest lay in things on an outward level devoid of what was inward, would nevertheless represent those on an inward 
level. This is clear from the representation of 'the children of Israel' as those whose interest lay in things on an outward level devoid of those on an inward one, dealt with just above in <a href="10692.htm">10692</a>. 
The reason why those who would represent things on an inward level is also meant is that Moses won for that nation the concession that it should represent the Church even though they were by nature such 
that no Church could be established among them. No Church can exist among those whose interest lies in things on an outward level devoid of what is inward, because the Church resides with a person 
on an inward level and not on an outward one devoid of the inward. For a person is in contact with heaven and with the Lord through the inward level; when this does not exist, that is, when it has been 
closed off, he is in contact with hell. But although the children of Israel were by nature such that it was impossible for them to have any contact with heaven through the inward level, they were nevertheless 
able to represent such things as belonged to the Church and heaven. This was accomplished solely by means of outward things to which inward ones correspond; and it was on account of this that 
they were accepted.  </p>
<p>No Church existed among that nation, only a representative of the Church, see in the places referred to in <a href="9320.htm">9320</a>(end), <a href="10396.htm">10396</a>.  Through the outward things which represented 
inward ones contact with heaven was effected, see again in the places referred to in <a href="9320.htm">9320</a>(end), <a href="10396.htm">10396</a>, and also what is said in <a href="10492.htm">10492</a>, <a href="10500.htm">10500</a>, <a href="10549.htm">10549</a>-<a href="10551.htm">10551</a>, <a href="10570.htm">10570</a>, <a href="10575.htm">10575</a>, <a href="10602.htm">10602</a>, <a href="10629.htm">10629</a>.  </p>

`Et postea accesserunt omnes filii Israelis':  quod significet omnes qui in externis absque {1}interno, et usque repraesentarent interna, constat ex repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis' quod sint qui 
in externis absque {2}interno, de qua mox supra n. 10692; quo etiam sit qui repraesentarent interna, est quia Moscheh obtinuit, ut apud gentem illam repraesentaretur Ecclesia, tametsi erant tales ut 
apud illos nulla Ecclesia institui posset; qui enim in externis absque interno sunt, apud illos non dari potest Ecclesia, quia Ecclesia est in interno hominis et non in externo absque illo; communicatio 
enim hominis cum caelo et cum Domino est per internum; quando hoc non est, hoc est, quando id occlusum est, tunc communicatio est cum inferno; sed tametsi filii Israelis tales erant ut {3}non per 
internum apud illos {4} communicatio cum caelo dari posset, usque (x)repraesentare potuerunt talia quae Ecclesiae et caeli erant; quod fit solum per externa {5}quibus correspondent interna, ideo recepti 
sunt; quod {6}apud illam gentem non Ecclesia fuerit sed modo repraesentativum Ecclesiae, videatur in locis citatis n. 9320 fin., 10396, et quod per externa, quae repraesentaverunt interna, facta sit 
communicatio cum caelo, in locis citatis etiam n. 9320 fin., 10396, tum n. 10492, 10500, 10549-10551, 10570, 10575, 10602, 10629. @1 interno altered to internis cp n. 10684$ @2 internis$ @3 After
