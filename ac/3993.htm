<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3993节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3993.</strong>“从羊群中挑出一切有点有斑的羊”表“拉班”所表示的良善与真理，凡与“点”所表示的邪恶混杂，或与“斑”所表示的虚假混杂的，都要被分离出去。这从“挑出”（removing）和“羊”的含义清楚可知：“挑出”是指分离；“羊群中的羊”（此处是山羊和羔羊）是指良善与真理（<a href="1824.htm">1824</a>，<a href="3519.htm">3519</a>节）。这些细节和本章接下来的细节含有奥秘在里面，这一事实可从以下分析看出来：它们若非含有比字面上所看到的还要深的奥秘，绝大多数在神性圣言中是不值一提的；如：雅各要求以山羊当中有斑有点的，羔羊当中黑色的为他的工价；然后他将皮剥成白纹的榛树和梧桐树的嫩枝插在水沟里，正对着当时发热的拉班的羊群；至于羔羊，他使羊群面对拉班羊群中有纹和黑色的；他由此以邪恶的伎俩，而非正当的手段变得富有。这些事并未表现出任何神性之物，而圣言的一切事物，无论总体还是细节，直至一点一划，都是神性。此外，知道知道这一切对救恩毫无用处；然而，圣言因是神性，故里面所包含的事物无不有助于救恩和永生。<br />通过这些，以及其它类似细节，谁都能断定，它们里面隐藏着某个奥秘，尽管从字义上看，它们是那种不值一提的事实，然而其中的每一个细节都蕴含着更为神性的观念。不过，若不通过内义，也就是若不知道天使如何理解这些事，谁也看不出这些观念准确来说是什么；当世人看到历史的属世意义时，天使觉察到的是属灵意义。这两种意义表面看似相距甚远，而事实上，它们彼此联结得十分紧密；这一点从前面所解释的历史细节，以及所有其它此类细节很清楚地看出来。诚然，包含在此处和随后本章中那些细节的奥秘本身从前面关于拉班和雅各的阐述能在某种程度上得知，即：“拉班”表示诸如能服务于引入纯正良善与真理的那类良善，而“雅各”表示真理的良善。然而，很少有人知道何为对应于属灵良善的属世良善，更少有人知道何为属灵良善，并且这二者之间必存在一个对应关系，罕有人知道仅看似良善的那类良善是用来引入纯正良善与真理的手段。既如此，那么论述这些事的奥秘就无法轻易解释清楚，因为它们会落入理解力或认知的阴影中。确切地说，这就像是有人以外语来谈论，无论把这个事情解释得多么清楚，听者都不会明白的。尽管如此，还是要让人们知道隐藏在圣言内义中的事，此处细节里面的真正奥秘如今要揭开。<br />就至高意义而言，此处论述的主题是主，即祂如何使自己的属世层变成神性；就代表意义而言，主题则是人里面的属世层，即主如何重生这属世层，并使它与人的内层人，也就是那肉体死后继续活着、那时被称为人之灵的相对应。当从肉身被释放出来时，除了肉和骨之外，人的灵会将外在人的一切都带走。内在人与外在人的这种对应关系若不在时间，或在肉身生活中实现，以后就不会实现了。此处在内义上所论述的主题就是主通过重生将这二者结合起来。<br />前几节论述了人在能重生之前必须接受并承认的一般真理，这些真理由雅各和利亚并使女所生的十个儿子来表示；然后论述了（此人接受并承认这些真理后）外在人与内层人，也就是属世人与“约瑟”所表示的属灵人的结合。现在按照这个次序，所论述的主题是良善的繁殖和真理的增多，一旦理性人与属灵人结合，这种情形就开始照着它们结合的程度出现。这就是雅各通过拉班的羊群为自己所获得的“羊群”所表示的。“羊群”在此表示良善与真理，如在圣言别处频繁所表示的。“拉班的羊群”表示“拉班”所代表的良善，其性质早已阐述过。“雅各的羊群”表示通过拉班代表的良善所获得的纯正良善与真理。<br />此处便描述了获得这些纯正良善与真理的方式。然而，这种方式绝不被理解，除非知道“斑”、“点”、“黑”、“白”在内义上表示什么，因而必须先在此解释它们。有斑的，或有点的，就是由黑和白构成的。一般来说，“黑”表示邪恶，尤表人的自我（proprium），因为这自我无非是邪恶。但是，“暗”（dark）表示虚假，尤表虚假原则。“白”在内义上表示真理，严格来说，表示主的公义和功德（Righteousness and Merit），由此表示主在人里面的公义和功德。这种白被称为“亮白”，因为它从主所放射的光闪耀出来。但在反面意义上，“白”表示自我公义，或人自己的功德。事实上，没有良善的真理都具有这种自我功德在里面，因为当人的善行并非源于真理的良善时，他总是渴望得到某种回报，因他行善是为了自己。而当良善隐藏人所付诸实践的真理后面时，这真理就会被主所放射的光照亮。由此可见“斑”和“点”分别表示什么，即“斑”表示与虚假混杂的真理；“点”表示与邪恶混杂的良善。<br />来世所看到的实际色彩如此美丽和明亮，以至于无法描述（<a href="1053.htm">1053</a>，<a href="1624.htm">1624</a>节）。它们就是白与黑里面的光影混杂的产物。不过，尽管那里的光在肉眼面前显为光，却和世上的光不一样。天上的光含有聪明和智慧在里面，因为来自主的神性聪明和智慧在那里就显为光，并且光照整个天堂（<a href="2776.htm">2776</a>，<a href="3138.htm">3138</a>，<a href="3167.htm">3167</a>，<a href="3190.htm">3190</a>，<a href="3195.htm">3195</a>，<a href="3222.htm">3222</a>，<a href="3223.htm">3223</a>，<a href="3225.htm">3225</a>，<a href="3339.htm">3339</a>-<a href="3341.htm">3341</a>，<a href="3485.htm">3485</a>，<a href="3636.htm">3636</a>，<a href="3643.htm">3643</a>，<a href="3862.htm">3862</a>节）。同样，来世的阴影尽管看似阴影，却和世上的阴影不一样；因为那里的阴影就是光的缺乏，因而是聪明和智慧的缺乏。由于在来世，白和黑是含有聪明和智慧在里面的光之产物，以及缺乏聪明和智慧的阴影之产物，故显而易见，“白”和“黑”就表示诸如前面所阐述的那类事物。结果，色彩是由白与黑所构成的表面里面的光影变化，因此这就是被称为色彩的这些变化所产生的多样性（<a href="1042.htm">1042</a>，<a href="1043.htm">1043</a>，<a href="1053.htm">1053</a>节）。<br />由此可见，“有斑的”，也就是标有或布满黑白点的表示什么，即表示与邪恶混杂的良善；以及“有点的”表示什么，即表示与虚假混杂的真理。这些就是取自拉班良善的事物，以便服务于引入纯正的良善与真理。不过，至于它们能以哪种方式服务于这一目的，这是一个奥秘；事实上，这个奥秘能清楚地呈现在那些处于天堂之光的人面前，因为如前所述，这光含有聪明在里面；但它却无法清楚呈现在那些处于尘世之光的人面前，除非他们的尘世之光被天堂之光照亮，如那些已重生之人的情形。因为每一个重生之人都在自己那来自天堂之光的属世之光里面看见良善与真理，因为天堂之光会给他的理解或认知带来视觉，而尘世的劣质之光则赋予他属世的视觉。<br />有必要补充几句话，以进一步解释此中情形。人里面没有纯粹的良善，或不与邪恶混杂的良善；也没有纯粹的真理，或不与虚假混杂的真理。这是因为人的意愿无非是邪恶，虚假由此不断流入他的理解或认知；众所周知，人通过遗传接受他祖祖辈辈逐渐累积来的邪恶，又由此制造了实际的邪恶，将其变成自己的，并把他自己的邪恶进一步添加到这遗传上。但居于人身上的邪恶各种各样；有些邪恶不能与良善混杂，有些邪恶则能与良善混杂；这同样适用于虚假。若非如此，绝没有人能够重生。不能与良善并真理混杂的邪恶与虚假就是违背对神之爱与对邻之爱的那类；即仇恨、报复、残忍，随之与自己相比对他人的蔑视，以及由此而来的虚假说服。但能与良善并真理混杂的邪恶与虚假则是不违背对神之爱与对邻之爱的那类。<br />例如：若有人爱自己胜过他人，并出于这爱而努力在私下和公众生活中胜过别人，在知识和教义上胜过他们，被提升到比别人更重要的位置上，以及比别人更富有，同时又承认和敬拜主，发自内心向邻人做善事，出于良知行公义公平，那么属于其自我之爱的邪恶就是能与良善并真理混杂的那种。因为这是一种人自己的邪恶，因邪恶而与生俱来。突然将这邪恶从他身上拿走，就会扑灭他里面最初燃烧的生命之火。但若有人爱自己胜过他人，并出于这爱与自己相比蔑视他人，仇恨那些不尊重他，可以说崇拜他的人，因而在报复和残忍中享受仇恨的快乐，那么这种爱的邪恶就是无法与良善并真理混杂的那种，因为它们是对立面。<br />再举一例：若有人自以为从罪中洁净，因而被清洗干净，就像有人用大量的水洗去污秽一样，一旦他悔改，执行了所规定的处罚，或他进行忏悔并听到听告解神父说他脱离了罪恶后，或领受圣餐后，过上一种新生活，并处于对良善与真理的情感，那么这虚假就是能与良善混杂的那种。但是，若他仍和以前一样，继续过着肉欲和世俗的生活，那么这虚假就是无法与良善混杂的那种。<br />若有人以为人凭着相信良善，而非凭着意愿良善而得救，然而又意愿良善，进而行善，那么这虚假就是能依附于良善与真理的那种；但是，若他不意愿良善，进而行善，就是不能依附的那种。同样，若有人不知道人死后会再次兴起，进而不信复活，或有人知道但仍怀疑或几乎否认它，然而却活在真理与良善中，那么良善与真理也能与这虚假混杂。但是，若他活在虚假与邪恶中，真理与良善就无法与这虚假混杂，因为它们是对立面；并且这虚假会摧毁真理，邪恶则会摧毁良善。<br />以良善为目的的伪装和城府，无论这良善是邻舍的良善，还是国家或教会的良善，就是谨慎；与它们混在一起的邪恶就能通过并为了这目的而与良善混杂。但是，以邪恶为目的的伪装和城府则不是谨慎，而是诡诈和欺骗。良善绝无可能与它们结合，因为具有邪恶目的的欺骗会将属地狱之物带入人的一切事物，无论还是细节，将邪恶置于中间，将良善丢到周边。这种次序就是地狱的次序本身。其它无数例子也一样。<br />有些邪恶与虚假是能依附于良善与真理的，这一点仅从以下事实就能看出来：虽然有如此众多不同的信条和教义存在，其中许多完全是异端的，然而每一种中都有人得救。这一点也可从以下事实看出来：主的教会甚至存在于教会之外的外邦人当中；虽然他们处于虚假，但那些过着仁爱生活的人仍能得救（<a href="2589.htm">2589</a>-<a href="2604.htm">2604</a>节）。若非有能与良善混杂的邪恶，并能与真理混杂的虚假，这种情形是绝无可能的。因为能与良善混杂的邪恶，并能与真理混杂的虚假，能被主奇妙地排列成序。它们不是结合起来，更不是合而为一，而是相互毗邻，彼此相接，并且是以这种方式，良善连同真理占据中间，可以说占据核心，而邪恶与虚假则占据向外辐射，直到周边区域或四围的位置。因此，前者被后者光照，也就是邪恶与虚假从良善与真理接受光，并像从中间或核心放射的光所制造的白与黑的斑点那样斑驳。这就是天上的次序。这些就是“斑”和“点”在内义上所表示的事。</p>

Removing from thence every small cattle that is speckled and spotted. That this signifies that all the good and truth that is His will be separated wherewith there is mingled evil (signified by the "speckled"), 
and falsity (signified by the "spotted"), is evident from the signification of "removing," as being to separate; and from the signification of a "flock" (here one of goats and lambs), as being 
goods and truths (see n. 1824, 3519). That there are arcana in these and the following verses of this chapter, may be seen from many of the things being such as would not be worthy of mention in 
the Divine Word, unless there were within them things more arcane than appear in the letter; as that Jacob asked for his reward or hire the speckled and spotted among the goats, and the black among the 
lambs; that he then placed in the gutters rods of hazel and plane-tree with the bark peeled off to the white before the flocks of Laban when they grew warm, and that as regards the lambs, he set the 
face of the flock toward the variegated and the black in Laban's flock; and that he thus became rich, not by a good but by an evil art. In these things there does not appear anything Divine, whereas 
all things of the Word both in general and in particular, down to the smallest jot, are Divine. Moreover to know all this is not of the slightest avail for salvation; and yet the Word, being Divine, contains 
within it nothing that is not conducive to salvation and eternal life.  [2] From all this, and the like things elsewhere, everyone may conclude that some arcanum is contained within, and that 
each one of the particulars, notwithstanding its being of such a character in the letter, yields things more Divine within. But what they yield within cannot possibly appear to anyone, except from the 
internal sense; that is, unless he knows how these things are perceived by the angels, who are in the spiritual sense while man is in the historic natural sense. And how remote these two senses appear 
from each other, although most closely conjoined, may be clearly seen from the particulars already explained and from all the rest. The arcanum itself contained in this and the following verses of 
this chapter, can indeed be known in some degree from what has been already said concerning Laban and Jacob, namely, that "Laban" is such good as can serve to introduce genuine goods and truths, and that 
"Jacob" is the good of truth. But as few persons know what the natural is that corresponds to spiritual good, and still fewer what spiritual good is, and that there must be a correspondence between 
them; and as still fewer know that a kind of good which only appears to be good is the means of introducing genuine goods and truths, the arcana that treat of these things cannot be easily explained 
to the apprehension, for they fall into the shade of the understanding, and it is as if one were speaking in a foreign language, so that however clearly the matter may be set forth, the hearer does not 
understand. Nevertheless it is to be set forth, because that which the Word stores up in its internal sense is now to be opened. [3] In the supreme sense the subject here treated of is the Lord, how 
He made His natural Divine; and in the representative sense the natural in man, how the Lord regenerates it, and reduces it to correspondence with the man that is within; that is, with him who will 
live after the death of the body, and is then called the spirit of the man, which when released from the body takes with it all that belongs to the outward man, except the bones and the flesh. Unless 
the correspondence of the internal man with the external has been effected in time, or in the life of the body, it is not effected afterwards. The conjunction of the two by the Lord by means of regeneration 
is here treated of in the internal sense.  [4] The general truths that man must receive and acknowledge before he can be regenerated have been treated of heretofore-being signified by the ten 
sons of Jacob and Leah and the handmaids-and, after the man has received and acknowledged these truths, the conjunction of the external man with the interior, or of the natural with the spiritual signified 
by "Joseph" is treated of. And now in accordance with the order the subject treated of is the fructification of good and the multiplication of truth, which come forth for the first time when this 
conjunction has been effected, and precisely so far as it is effected. This is what is signified by the "flock" that Jacob acquired by means of the flock of Laban. By "flock" here is signified good 
and truth, as elsewhere frequently in the Word; and by the "flock of Laban," the good represented by Laban, the nature of which has been already stated. The "flock of Jacob" signifies the genuine good 
and truth procured by means of the good represented by Laban, and there is here described the manner in which these genuine goods and truths are acquired. [5] But this cannot by any means be comprehended 
unless it is known what is signified in the internal sense by "speckled," by "spotted," by "black," and by "white," which therefore must now be explained in the first instance. That which is speckled 
and spotted is that which is composed of black and white; and in general "black" signifies evil, and specifically what is man's own, because this is nothing but evil. But "dark" signifies falsity, 
and specifically the principles of falsity. "White" in the internal sense signifies truth, properly the Lord's righteousness and merit, and derivatively the Lord's righteousness and merit in man. 
This white is called "bright white," because it shines from the light that is from the Lord. But in the opposite sense "white" signifies man's own righteousness, or his own merit; for truth without good 
is attended with such self-merit, because when anyone does good, not from the good of truth, he always desires to be recompensed, because he does it for the sake of himself; whereas when anyone does 
truth from good, this good is then enlightened by the light that is from the Lord. This shows what is signified by "spotted," namely, the truth with which falsity is mingled; and what by "speckled," 
namely, the good with which evil is mingled.  [6] Actual colors are seen in the other life, so beautiful and resplendent that they cannot be described (see n. 1053, 1624); and they are from the variegation 
of light and shade in white and black. But although the light there appears as light before the eyes, it is not like the light in this world. The light in heaven has within it intelligence and 
wisdom; for Divine intelligence and wisdom from the Lord are there presented as light, and also illumine the universal heaven (n. 2776, 3138, 3167, 3190, 3195, 3222, 3223, 3225, 3339-3341, 3485, 3636, 
3643, 3862). And in like manner although the shade in the other life appears as shade, it is yet not like the shade in this world; for the shade there is absence of the light, and accordingly is lack 
of intelligence and wisdom. As therefore the white and black there come forth from a light that has intelligence and wisdom within it, and from a shade that is lack of intelligence and wisdom, it is 
evident that by "white" and "black" are signified such things as have been stated above. Consequently as colors are modifications of light and shade in whites and blacks, as in planes, it is the variegations 
thus produced that are called colors (n. 1042, 1043, 1053). [7] From all this we can now see that that which is "speckled," that is, that which is marked and dotted all over with black and white 
points, signifies the good with which evil is mingled; and also that that which is "spotted" signifies the truth with which falsity is mingled. These are the things that were taken from the good 
of Laban in order to serve for introducing genuine goods and truths. But how these can serve this purpose is an arcanum which can indeed be presented clearly before those who are in the light of heaven, 
because as before said within this light there is intelligence; but it cannot be clearly presented before those who are in the light of the world, unless their light of the world has been enlightened 
by the light of heaven, as is the case with those who have been regenerated; for every regenerate person sees goods and truths in his natural light from the light of heaven, because the light of heaven 
produces his intellectual sight, and the light of the world his natural sight.  [8] A few words shall be added to further explain how the case herein is. In man there is no pure good, that is, good 
with which evil is not mingled; nor pure truth, with which falsity is not mingled. For man's will is nothing but evil, from which there continually flows falsity into his understanding; because, as 
is well known, man receives by inheritance the evil successively accumulated by his progenitors, and from this he produces evil in an actual form, and makes it his own, and adds thereto more evil of 
himself. But the evils with man are of various kinds; there are evils with which goods cannot be mingled, and there are evils with which they can be mingled; and it is the same with the falsities. Unless 
this were so, no man could possibly be regenerated. The evils and falsities with which goods and truths cannot be mingled are such as are contrary to love to God and love toward the neighbor; namely, 
hatreds, revenges, cruelties, and a consequent contempt for others in comparison with one's self; and also the consequent persuasions of falsity. But the evils and falsities with which goods and 
truths can be mingled are those which are not contrary to love to God and love toward the neighbor. [9] For example: If anyone loves himself more than others, and from this love studies to excel others 
in moral and civic life, in memory-knowledges and doctrinal things, and to be exalted to dignities and wealth in pre-eminence to others, and yet acknowledges and adores God, performs kind offices to 
his neighbor from the heart, and does what is just and fair from conscience; the evil of this love of self is one with which good and truth can be mingled; for it is an evil that is man's own, and that 
is born hereditarily; and to take it away from him suddenly would be to extinguish the fire of his first life. But the man who loves himself above others, and from this love despises others in comparison 
with himself, and hates those who do not honor and as it were adore him, and therefore feels a consequent delight of hatred in revenge and cruelty-the evil of such a love as this is one with which 
good and truth cannot be mingled, for they are contraries. [10] To take another example: If anyone believes himself to be pure from sins, and thus washed clean, as one who is washed from filth by 
much water; when such a man has once performed repentance and has done the imposed penance, or after confession has heard such a declaration from his confessor, or after he has partaken of the Holy 
Supper-if he then lives a new life, in the affection of good and truth, this falsity is one with which good can be mingled. But if he lives a carnal and worldly life, as before, the falsity is then one 
with which good cannot be mingled. [11] Again: The man who believes that a man is saved by believing well, and not by willing well; and yet wills well and in consequence does well-this falsity is one 
to which good and truth can be adjoined; but not so if he does not will well and therefore do well. In like manner if anyone is ignorant that man rises again after death, and consequently does not 
believe in the resurrection; or if he is aware of it, but still doubts, and almost denies it, and yet lives in truth and good-with this falsity also good and truth can be mingled; but if he lives in falsity 
and evil, truth and good cannot be mingled with this falsity, because they are contraries; and the falsity destroys the truth, and the evil destroys the good. [12] Again: The simulation and cunning 
that have what is good as their end, whether it is that of the neighbor, or that of our country, or of the church, are prudence; and the evils that are mixed up with them can be mingled with good, 
from and for the sake of the end. But the simulation and cunning that have evil as their end, are not prudence, but are craft and deceit, with which good can by no means be conjoined; for deceit, which 
is an end of evil, induces what is infernal upon all things in man both in general and in particular, places evil in the middle, and rejects good to the circumference; which order is infernal order 
itself. And it is the same in numberless other cases.  [13] That there are evils and falsities to which goods and truths can be adjoined, may be seen from the mere fact that there are so many diverse 
dogmas and doctrines, many of which are altogether heretical, and yet in each there are those who are saved; and also that the Lord's church exists even among the Gentiles who are out of the church; 
and although they are in falsities, nevertheless those are saved who live a life of charity (n. 2589-2604); which could by no means be the case unless there were evils with which goods, and falsities 
with which truths, can be mingled. For the evils with which goods and the falsities with which truths can be mingled, are wonderfully disposed into order by the Lord; for they are not conjoined together, 
still less united into a one; but are adjoined and applied to one another, and this in such manner that the goods together with the truths are in the middle and as it were in the center, and by 
degrees toward the circumferences or circuits are such evils and falsities. Thus the latter are lighted up by the former, and are variegated like things white and black by light from the middle or center. 
This is heavenly order. These are the things that are signified in the internal sense by the "speckled" and the "spotted." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3993</b></p><p><b>3993.</b>
'Removing from it every speckled and spotted member of the flock' means that everything good and true that is meant by 'Laban' and which - when mingled with evil, meant by 'speckled', or mingled with 
falsity, meant by 'spotted' - will be separated. This is clear from the meaning of 'removing' as separating, and from the meaning of 'member of the flock', in this case she-goats and lambs, as goods 
and truths, dealt with in <a href="1824.htm">1824</a>, <a href="3519.htm">3519</a>. The fact that these details and those that follow in this chapter hold arcana within them may be recognized from the consideration that for the most part they would 
not be worth mentioning in the Divine Word if they did not include any deeper arcana than those to be seen in the letter, such as the following: For his wages Jacob asked for the speckled and the spotted 
among the she-goats and for the black among the lambs; and after this, in the runners he placed rods - which he had peeled down to the white and which were of hazel and of plane - in front of Laban's 
flocks when these came on heat, and in the case of the lambs he set the faces of the flock towards the variegated and the black in Laban's flock, thereby making himself rich not by the use of a 
good skill but of an evil one. These details do not seem to hold anything Divine within them, and yet the Word is Divine in every single part, even to the smallest part of a letter. And what is more, 
knowing all these details does not contribute one tiny bit to a person's salvation, yet being Divine the Word does not contain within itself anything else than such things as lead to salvation and eternal 
life. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 From these details and others like them elsewhere anyone may come to the conclusion that some arcanum is concealed within them, and that although in the literal sense they are the kind 
of facts that are not worth mentioning, those details - every single one - are pregnant with ideas much more Divine. But what exactly these ideas may be cannot possibly be seen by anyone except from 
the internal sense, that is, unless he knows the way in which angels perceive these matters; for they perceive the spiritual sense when man sees the historical natural sense. How remote these two senses 
seem to be from each other when in fact they are closely linked to one another may become quite evident from the historical details explained above and from all other such details. The actual arcanum 
present within the details here and in those after them in this chapter may, it is true, be known to some extent from what has been stated already about Laban and Jacob - about 'Laban' meaning the 
kind of good by means of which genuine goods and truths are able to be introduced, while 'Jacob' means the good of truth. Yet few know what natural good corresponding to spiritual good is, even fewer 
what spiritual good is and that a correspondence ought to exist between the two, and fewer still that a type of good which merely looks like good is the means for introducing genuine goods and truths. 
This being so, the arcana which describe these matters cannot be explained easily and intelligibly since they fall within the poorly lit parts of the understanding. It is rather like someone talking 
in a foreign language, in that no matter how clearly the thing is explained in that language the hearer does not understand. Even so, because what is concealed in the internal sense of the Word is 
to be made known, the actual arcanum within the details here has to be discussed. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the highest sense the subject at this point is how the Lord made His own Natural Divine, and in the representative 
sense how the Lord regenerates the natural as it exists with man and brings it into correspondence with his interior man, that is, with that which is going to live after the death of the body. 
At that point it is called man's spirit which, when released from the body, takes with it every part of the external man except the flesh and bones. If the correspondence of the internal man with the 
external has not been effected in the temporal state, that is, during a person's life in the body, it is not effected after that. The Lord's joining of the two together through regeneration is the subject 
in the internal sense here. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Previous sections have dealt with the general truths which a person ought to receive and acknowledge before he can be regenerated, those truths being meant by Jacob's 
ten sons by Leah and the servant-girls; then they deal - after he has received and acknowledged them - with the joining of the external man to the interior, that is, of the natural man to the spiritual, 
which was meant by 'Joseph'. Now in the sequence of ideas the subject is the fruitfulness of good and the multiplication of truth which begin to occur once the rational man has been joined to 
the spiritual, and in the measure that they are so joined. These are the considerations meant by the flock which Jacob acquired to himself by means of Laban's flock. 'Flock' here means good and truth, 
as it does many times elsewhere in the Word. 'Laban's flock' means the good that is represented by 'Laban', the nature of which has been stated above; 'Jacob's flock' means the genuine good and truth 
which is acquired by means of that good represented by Laban.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 It is the way in which genuine goods and truths are acquired that is described here. Yet this cannot by any means be comprehended 
unless one knows what is meant in the internal sense by 'speckled', 'spotted', 'black' and 'white', and therefore these must first be dealt with here. That which is speckled or that which is spotted 
consists of black and of white. In general 'black' means that which is evil, in particular man's proprium since this is nothing but evil. 'Dark' however means that which is false, and in particular 
false assumptions. 'White' in the internal sense means truth; strictly speaking it means the Lord's Righteousness and Merit, and from this the Lord's righteousness and merit as these exist with man. This 
whiteness is called bright because it shines from the light that radiates from the Lord. But 'white' in the contrary sense means self-righteousness or one's own merit. Indeed truth devoid of good 
has such merit within it, for when any good action performed by a person does not stem from the good of truth that person always desires something in return since he acts for the sake of himself. But 
when good lies behind the truth that a person carries into effect, that truth is enlightened by the light which radiates from the Lord. From this one may see what is meant by 'spotted', namely truth with 
which falsity has been mingled, and what by 'speckled', namely good with which evil has been mingled. </p>

 Actually visible in the next life are colours so beautiful and bright that they defy description, <a href="1053.htm">1053</a>, <a href="1624.htm">1624</a>. They are the product of the variegation of light and shade within white and black. But although it appears before the eyes as light, the light there is unlike the light in the world. 
The light in heaven includes intelligence and wisdom, for Divine Intelligence and Wisdom from the Lord manifest themselves there as light and also light up the whole of heaven, <a href="2776.htm">2776</a>, <a href="3138.htm">3138</a>, <a href="3167.htm">3167</a>, 
<a href="3190.htm">3190</a>, <a href="3195.htm">3195</a>, <a href="3222.htm">3222</a>, <a href="3223.htm">3223</a>, <a href="3225.htm">3225</a>, <a href="3339.htm">3339</a>-<a href="3341.htm">3341</a>, <a href="3485.htm">3485</a>, <a href="3636.htm">3636</a>, <a href="3643.htm">3643</a>, <a href="3862.htm">3862</a>. Shade likewise in the next life, although it appears as shade, is unlike shade in the world, since the shade in that life is the absence 
of light and as a consequence the lack of intelligence and wisdom. So because the white and the black are in the next life a product of light which has intelligence and wisdom within it, and a product 
of the shade which is the lack of these, it is evident that white and black mean such things as have been stated above. Consequently, since colours are the modifications of light and shade within 
surfaces consisting of white and black, it is the variegations produced by those modifications that are called colours, <a href="1042.htm">1042</a>, <a href="1043.htm">1043</a>, <a href="1053.htm">1053</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 From all this one may see what is meant by speckled, or 
marked and dotted with black and white specks, namely good with which evil has been mingled, and also what is meant by spotted, namely truth with which falsity has been mingled. These are the things 
that were taken from 'Laban good' to serve in the introducing of genuine goods and truths. But in what way they are able to serve is an arcanum which can indeed be presented clearly to those who see in 
the light of heaven because this light, as has been stated, holds intelligence within it, but not to those who see in the light of the world unless their light of the world is lit up by the light of 
heaven, as it is with those who are regenerate. For every regenerate person sees goods and truths within his own natural light from the light of heaven, because the light of heaven brings sight to his 
understanding even as the inferior light of the world gives him natural sight. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 But all this needs to be taken a little further. No pure good, or good with which evil is not mingled, exists with 
anyone. Neither does any pure truth, or truth with which falsity is not mingled, exist with him. This is because man's will is nothing but evil, from which falsity is constantly passing into his understanding; 
for as is well known, he possesses by inheritance the evil that has been accumulated consecutively by his forefathers. From this inheritance he brings out evil into his own actions and makes 
it his own, adding further evil from himself to the inheritance. But the evils residing with man are of various kinds. There are evils with which goods cannot be mingled and there are evils with which 
they can. And the same applies to falsities. If this were not so nobody could ever have been regenerated. The evils and falsities with which goods and truths cannot be mingled are ones that are contrary 
to love to God and love towards the neighbour - forms of hatred, revenge, and cruelty, and consequent contempt for others in comparison with oneself, and also consequent false persuasions. But 
the evils and falsities with which goods and truths can be mingled are ones that are not contrary to love to God and love towards the neighbour. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 Take for example anyone who loves himself more 
than others and because of that love strives to excel others in private life and in public life, to excel them in knowledge and doctrine, and to be promoted to positions of greater importance than others, 
and also to greater affluence than others. If at the same time he acknowledges and adores the Lord, from the heart performs acts of kindness to the neighbour, and from conscience behaves justly and 
fairly, the evil that belongs to his self-love is such that good and truth can be mingled with it. For this is an evil which belongs to a person as his own and into which he is born by heredity. And 
to take that away from him suddenly would be to put out the fire of life that burns in him at first. But in the case of someone who loves himself more than others and because of that love despises others 
in comparison with himself, hates those who do not hold him in esteem and so to speak adore him, and therefore enjoys the feelings of hatred that are present in revenge and cruelty, the evil of 
that love is such that good and truth cannot be mingled with it because they are contraries. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[10]</b>
 Take as another example anyone who believes that he is pure from sins, and so is cleansed like somebody 
from whom dirt has been washed away by means of much water, once he has repented and carried out the prescribed penances, or after he has made his confession and heard the confessor declare him free 
from sins, or after he has been to the Holy Supper. If he leads a new life, being stirred by an affection for good and truth, that falsity is such that good can be mingled with it. But if he goes 
on leading a carnal and worldly life as before, it is in that case a falsity with which good cannot be mingled. Also, with anyone who believes that man is saved by virtue of believing what is good and 
not of willing it, and yet who does will what is good and therefore does it, that falsity is such that good and truth can be attached to it. But not so if he does not will what is good and therefore 
does not do it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[11]</b>
 Take yet another example. If anyone does not know that man rises again after death and consequently does not believe in the resurrection, or else if anyone who does know but nevertheless 
doubts or practically denies it, and yet each one leads a life of truth and goodness, good and truth can be mingled with that falsity also. But if a person leads a life of falsity and evil 
they cannot be mingled with that same falsity because they are contraries. The falsity destroys the truth, and the evil destroys the good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[12]</b>
 And still another example. Pretence and shrewdness which 
have a good end in view, whether the good of the neighbour, or of one's country, or of the Church, constitute prudence. The evils that are mixed up with them can be mingled with good by reason of 
and for the sake of the end in view. But presence and shrewdness which have an evil end in view do not constitute prudence but trickery and deceit. Good cannot possibly be joined to these, for deceit 
which goes with an evil end in view brings what is of hell into every single part of a person, sets evil in the middle, and casts good away to the circumferences. This order is the order itself of hell. 
And so with countless other examples that could be taken. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[13]</b>
 The fact that there are some evils and falsities to which goods and truths can be attached may be seen merely from the consideration 
that so many different dogmas and teachings exist, many of them totally heretical, and yet subscribing to each one there are people who are saved. The same may also be seen from the consideration that 
among gentiles outside of the Church there is another Church that is the Lord's, and that those are saved who lead charitable lives, even though falsities exist with them, <a href="2589.htm">2589</a> <a href="2604.htm">2604</a>. This could by 
no means be the case if there were no evils with which goods can be mingled, and no falsities with which truths can be mingled. For the evils with which goods are mingled, and the falsities with which 
truths are mingled, are wonderfully arranged into order by the Lord. For they are not combined with one another, still less are they made into one, but lie adjacent to and touch one another, so that 
in fact the goods together with the truths occupy the middle, at the central point so to speak, while the evils and falsities occupy positions radiating outwards to the surrounding areas or circumferences. 
Consequently the evils and falsities receive light from the goods and truths, and are variegated like patches of white and black created by light radiating from the middle or centre. This constitutes 
heavenly order. These are the things meant in the internal sense by 'speckled' and 'spotted'. </p>

Jacob pro mercede petierit pecus punctatum et maculosum in capris, et nigrum in agnis; quod dein in canaliculis posuerit baculos ex corylo et platano decorticatos ad album ante greges Labanis; cum 
incalescerent, et quoad agnos quod dederit facies gregis ad variegatum et nigrum in grege Labanis; et quod sic non bona sed {2}mala arte dives factus; in his non aliquid Divinum apparet, cum tamen 
Verbum in omnibus et singulis et quoad minimam iotam Divinum est; et praeterea hoc scire nihil prodest, ne quidem minimum ad salutem, cum tamen Verbum quia Divinum, non nisi quam talia quae conducunt 
ad salutem et ad vitam aeternam, in se continet; [2] {3}ex illis et ex similibus alibi, quisque concludere potest quod arcanum inibi sit, et quod singula, tametsi talia sunt in sensu litterae, 
diviniora ferant intus; quid autem intus ferunt, nusquam alicui constare potest nisi ex sensu interno, hoc est, nisi sciat quomodo haec percipiuntur ab angelis, {4}ii enim in sensu spirituali sunt 
cum homo in historico naturali; qui bini sensus, quam remoti appareant a se invicem, tametsi conjunctissimi sunt, ab his et reliquis luculenter patere potest.  Ipsum arcanum quod in his et sequentibus 
hujus capitis inest, quidem aliquatenus sciri potest ab illis quae prius de Labane et de Jacobo dicta sunt, quod nempe `Laban' sit tale bonum per quod bona et vera genuina introduci possint, et 
quod `Jacob' sit bonum veri; sed quia pauci sciunt quid sit naturale correspondens bono spirituali, et pauciores quid bonum spirituale, et quod correspondentia esse debeat, et adhuc pauciores quod 
bonum quoddam apparens ut bonum sit medium introducendi bona et vera genuina, ideo arcana quae de illis agunt, non facile ad captum possunt exponi, nam in umbram intellectus cadunt, et est sicut {5}quis 
aliena lingua loquitur, et in ea utcumque clare exponit rem, usque audiens non intelligit; sed tametsi ita est, usque dicendum quia quid Verbum in sensu interno recondit, aperiendum est.  Agitur 
hic in sensu supremo de Domino quomodo Ipse Naturale Suum Divinum fecit; et in sensu {6}repraesentativo de naturali apud hominem quomodo Dominus id regenerat, et redigit ad correspondentiam cum 
interiore ejus homine, hoc est, cum illo qui victurus post obitum corporis, {7}et tunc spiritus hominis vocatur, qui cum solutus est a corpore, secum habet omnia quae externi hominis sunt, praeter 
ossa et carnem; nisi correspondentia interni hominis cum externo facta {8}fuerit in tempore seu in vita corporis, postmodum non fit; de conjunctione utriusque per regenerationem a Domino in sensu 
interno hic agitur. [4] Actum est de communibus veris, quae homo recipere et agnoscere debet antequam regenerari potest; per `decem filios Jacobi ex Lea et ancillis' illa significata sunt; et postquam 
illa receperit et agnoverit, de conjunctione externi hominis cum interiore, seu naturalis cum spirituali, quod significatum est per `Josephum'; </p>
<p>nunc secundum ordinem agitur de fructificatione 
boni et multiplicatione veri, quae tunc primum existit quando conjunctio facta est, et tantum existit quantum conjunctio fit; haec sunt quae significantur per gregem quem sibi Jacobus comparavit per 
gregem Labanis; `grex' ibi significat bonum et verum, ut alibi multoties in Verbo, `grex Labanis' bonum quod per Labanem repraesentatur, quod quale sit, supra dictum est; `grex Jacobi' significat 
bonum et verum genuinum, quod comparatur per illud.  [5] Sed quomodo bona et vera genuina comparantur, hic describitur; sed hoc nullatenus comprehendi potest nisi sciatur quid per punctatum, quid 
per maculosum, quid per nigrum, et quid per album, in sensu interno significatur, quapropter hic primum de illis agendum: punctatum et maculosum est quod ex nigro et albo; `nigrum' significat in genere malum, 
in specie proprium hominis, quia hoc non nisi quam malum est; `tenebricosum' autem significat falsum, et in specie principia falsi; `album' in sensu {9}interno significat verum, proprie Justitiam 
et Meritum Domini, et inde justitiam et meritum Domini apud hominem; hoc album vocatur candidum, splendet enim a luce quae a Domino; `album' autem in opposito sensu significat justitiam propriam, 
seu meritum proprium; verum enim absque bono secum habet tale meritum, nam cum quis facit bonum, non ex bono veri, tunc semper vult retribui, nam propter se facit, at cum {10}verum facit ex 
bono, tunc illustratur {11}illud ex luce quae a Domino; inde patet quid `maculosum,' quod nempe sit verum cum quo mixtum falsum; </p>
<p>et quid `punctatum,' quod nempe sit bonum cum quo mixtum malum. [6] Apparent 
actualiter colores in altera vita tam pulchri et splendidi ut non describi queant, n. 1053, 1624; sunt illi ex variegatione lucis et umbrae in albo et nigro, sed lux ibi, tametsi ut lux 
coram oculis apparet, non tamen est sicut lux in mundo; lux in caelo in se habet intelligentiam et sapientiam, nam Divina Intelligentia et Sapientia a Domino ut lux ibi sistitur, et quoque illuminat universum 
caelum, n. 2776, 3138, 3167, 3190, 3195, 3222, 3223, 3225, 3339-3341, 3485, 3636, 3643, 3862; umbra etiam in altera vita, tametsi ut umbra apparet, non tamen est sicut umbra in mundo, umbra 
enim ibi est absentia lucis, proinde carentia intelligentiae et sapientiae; inde nunc album et nigrum, quae quia ex luce ibi in qua est intelligentia et sapientia, et ex umbra quae est carentia earum, 
existunt, patet quod per illa, nempe per album et nigrum, significentur talia quae supra dicta sunt; inde nunc colores qui sunt modificationes lucis et umbrae in albis et nigris, ut in planis, 
variegationes inde sunt quae vocantur colores, n. 1042, 1043, 1053; [7] {12}ex his nunc constare potest quid punctatum, seu signatum et discretum punctis, nempe nigris et albis, quod sit bonum 
cum quo mixtum malum, tum quid maculosum quod sit verum cum quo mixtum falsum; haec sunt quae ex bono Labanis desumpta sunt, inservitura introducendis bonis et veris genuinis; sed quomodo haec inservire 
possint, est arcanum, quod quidem clare sisti potest coram illis qui in luce caeli sunt, quia in hac, ut dictam, est intelligentia, sed non clare coram illis qui in luce mundi sunt, nisi lux 
mundi illorum illustrata sit a luce caeli, ut apud illos qui regenerati sunt; quisque enim regeneratus videt bona et vera in naturali suo lumine ex luce caeli, nam lux caeli facit visum ejus intellectualem, 
et lumen mundi visum naturalem; at quomodo se habent, paucis usque dicendum est; [8] apud hominem non datur bonum purum, seu bonum cum quo non mixtum est malum, nec verum purum, seu verum 
cum quo non mixtum est falsum; voluntarium enim hominis non est nisi quam malum, e quo continue in intellectuale ejus influit falsum, nam sicut notum est, homo hereditario secum trahit malum successive 
a parentibus cumulatum; ex hoc {13}ipse actualiter producit malum et facit suum, et adhuc malum a se superaddit; sed mala apud hominem sunt varii generis; sunt mala cum quibus bona non misceri 
possunt, et sunt mala cum quibus possunt; similiter falsa; </p>
<p>nisi hoc foret, nusquam aliquis homo potuisset regenerari; mala et falsa cum quibus non misceri possunt bona et vera, sunt quae contraria 
sunt amori in Deum, et amori erga proximum, sicut sunt odia, vindictae, crudelitates, et inde contemptus aliorum prae se; </p>
<p>tum quoque inde persuasiones falsi; at mala et falsa cum quibus misceri 
possunt bona et vera, sunt quae non contraria sunt amori in Deum et amori erga proximum, ut pro exemplo: [9] si quis amat se prae aliis, et ex illo amore studet excellere aliis in vita morali et 
civili, in scientificis et doctrinalibus, et ad dignitates evehi, et quoque ad opes prae aliis et tamen agnoscit et adorat Deum, officia ex corde praestat proxima ac justum et aequum ex conscientia 
agit, malum illius amoris sui es cum quo bonum et verum misceri possunt; est enim {14}malum quod proprium est hominis, (x)in quod hereditario nascitur, quod si ei cito auferretur, foret ignem vitae 
ejus primae exstinguere; at qui amat se prae aliis, et ex illo amore contemnit alios prae se, odio habet qui non honorant, et quasi adorant, et jucundum odii in vindicta e crudelitate propterea sentit, 
talis amoris malum est cum quo bonum et verum misceri non possunt, nam sunt contraria.  [10] Sit quoque pro exemplo, si quis credit se purum esse a peccatis, et ita abstersum sicut qui per aquas 
abluitur a sordibus, cum semel paenitentiam egit, et (x)poenitentialia imposita absolvit, aut post confessionem enuntiatum tale a confessore audivit, aut postquam sacram cenam frequentavit is 
si novam vitam vivit, in affectione boni et veri, illud falsum est cum quo bonum mixtum esse potest; at {15}si vivit vitam carnis et mundi, ut prius, tunc est falsum cum quo bonum misceri nequit.  
Porro, qui credit salvari hominem ex bene credere, et non ex bene velle, et tamen bene vult et inde bene facit, id falsum est cui adjungi potest bonum et verum, non autem si non bene vult et inde bene 
facit.  [11] Tum, si quis ignorat quod resurgit homo post mortem et inde non credit resurrectionem, ut et qui novit sed usque dubitat et paene negat, et tamen in vero et bono vivit, cum illo falso 
etiam misceri potest bonum et verum; at qui in falso et malo vivit, tunc cum falso illo non misceri potest, quia contraria sunt, et falsum destruit verum, et malum destruit bonum. [12] (m)Adhuc, 
simulatio et astutia quae pro fine habet bonum, sive proximi, sive patriae, sive Ecclesiae, est prudentia; mala quae ei admixta sunt, misceri possunt cum bono, ex fine et propter finem; </p>
<p>at simulatio 
et astutia quae pro fine habet malum, non est prudentia, sed est astus et dolus; cum hoc bonum nullatenus potest conjungi, nam dolus qui est finis mali, inducit infernale omnibus et singulis quae 
apud hominem, ac in medio ponit malum, (c)et ad peripherias rejicit bonum, qui ordo est ipse ordo infernalis(n): </p>
<p>ita in innumerabilibus aliis.  [13] Quod sint mala et falsa {16}quibus adjungi {17}queunt 
bona et vera, solum constare potest ex eo quod tot diversa dogmata et doctrinalia sint quorum {18}plura sunt prorsus haeretica, et tamen in unoquovis {19}sunt qui salvantur: tum quod inter 
gentes quae extra Ecclesiam sunt, etiam sit Ecclesia Domini, et tametsi in falsis sunt, usque illi qui {19}vitam charitatis vivunt, salventur n. 2589-2604, quod fieri nequicquam potuisset nisi mala 
sint cum quibus misceri {20}possunt bona, et falsa cum quibus vera; mala enim cum quibus miscentur bona, et falsa cum quibus vera, mirabiliter in ordinem disponuntur a Domino, non enim conjunguntur, 
minus uniuntur, sed adjunguntur et applicantur, et quidem ita ut in medio quasi in centro sint bona cum veris, et per gradus ad circuitus seu peripherias, talia mala et falsa; inde est quod haec 
illustrentur ab illis, et variegentur sicut alba et nigra a luce e medio aut e centro; {21}hic est ordo caelestis.  Haec sunt quae per `punctata et maculosa' in sensu interno significantur. @1 after
