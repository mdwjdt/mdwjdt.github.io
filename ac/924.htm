<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>924.</strong>创世记8:21．耶和华闻了那安息的气味，耶和华就心里说：“我不再因人的缘故咒诅土地，因为人心的妄想从小就是邪恶。我也再不照我所作的打击一切生物了。<br />“耶和华闻了那安息的气味”表源于仁和仁之信的敬拜讨主喜悦。“耶和华就心里说”表这事再也不会发生。“我不再咒诅土地”表人再不会这样远离了。“因人的缘故”表如属上古教会后代之人所做的那样。“因为人心的妄想从小就是邪恶”表人心智的意愿部分全然是恶。“我也再不照我所作的打击一切生物了”表人再也不会如此毁灭自己了。</p>

And Jehovah smelled a restful smell, and Jehovah said in his heart, "I will never again curse the ground on the human being's account, because what human hearts fabricate is evil from their youth. And I will never again strike every living thing as I have done."<br />Jehovah smelled a restful smell means that worship rising out of those things was pleasing to the Lord. And Jehovah said in his heart means that it would no longer happen this way. I will never again curse the ground means that humanity would no longer turn its back in this way. On the human being's account means in the way people among the earliest church's descendants had done. Because what human hearts fabricate is evil from their youth means that the volitional side of the human mind is completely evil. I will never again strike every living thing as I have done means that people could no longer destroy themselves in this way. </p>

Verse 21. And Jehovah smelled an odor of rest; and Jehovah said in His heart, I will not again curse the ground anymore on man's account; because the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; 
neither will I again smite anymore everything living, as I have done. "And Jehovah smelled an odor of rest" signifies that worship therefrom was grateful to the Lord, that is, worship from charity and 
the faith of charity; "and Jehovah said in His heart" signifies that it would happen so no more; "I will not again curse the ground anymore" signifies that man would not anymore so turn himself away; 
"on man's account" signifies as did the man of the posterity of the Most Ancient Church; "because the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth" signifies that man's will is altogether evil; 
"neither will I again smite anymore everything living, as I have done" signifies that man would not be able anymore so to destroy himself. </p>

Verse 21 And Jehovah smelled the odour of rest, and Jehovah said in His heart, I will curse the ground no more on account of man, for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his childhood. And I 
will no more strike every living thing, as I have done.  </p>
<p>'Jehovah smelled the odour of rest' means that worship stemming from these was pleasing to the Lord. 'And Jehovah said in His heart' means that 
it would never happen again. 'I will curse the ground no more' means that never again would man thus turn himself away. 'On account of man' means as the people who belonged to the descendants of the 
Most Ancient Church had done. 'For the imagination of man's heart is evil from his childhood' means that the will part of man's mind is totally evil. 'I will no more strike every living thing, as I 
have done' means that man would never again be able to destroy himself in that way. </p>

Vers. 21.  Et odoratus Jehovah odorem quietis, et dixit Jehovah in corde Suo, Non addam maledicere amplius humo, propter hominem, quia figmentum cordis hominis malum a pueritia ejus et non addam amplius 
percutere omne visum sicut feci. 'Odoratus Jehovah odorem quietis' significat quod gratus fuerit Domino cultus inde: 'et dixit Jehovah in corde Suo' significat quod ita non amplius fieret: 'non addam 
maledicere' amplius humo, significat quod homo non amplius ita se avertet: 'propter hominem' significat sicut homo e posteritate Antiquissimae Ecclesiae: 'quia figmentum cordis hominis malum a pueritia 
ejus' significat quod voluntarium hominis sit prorsus malum: 'non addam amplius percutere omne vivum sicut feci' significat quod homo non amplius ita se perdere poterit. </p>
