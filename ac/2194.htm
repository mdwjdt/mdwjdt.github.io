<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2194节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2194.</strong>“看哪，你的妻子撒拉必生一个儿子”表将要成为神圣理性。这从“儿子”、“撒拉”，以及“以撒”的含义清楚可知：“儿子”、“撒拉”，以及“以撒”均表示属于主的理性之物。“儿子”表真理（参看<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>节），“撒拉”表理性真理（参看<a href="2173.htm">2173</a>节），“以撒”表神圣理性（参看<a href="1893.htm">1893</a>，<a href="2066.htm">2066</a>，<a href="2083.htm">2083</a>节）。每个人所具有的人性都始于其理性的至内在部分，如前所述（<a href="2106.htm">2106</a>节）；主的人性也是如此：耶和华自己就在这人性之上，这和其他人的情况完全不同。由于人性始于理性的至内在部分，也由于主将祂自己所具有的一切人性都变成神性，故祂首先将这理性本身从其至内在变成神性。如前所述，“以撒”就代表和表示那已变成神性的理性。</p>

Behold, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. That this signifies the rational that was to be Divine, is evident from the signification of a "son" and of "Sarah," and also of "Isaac" who should be born to 
her. Both "son" and "Sarah," and also "Isaac," signify that which is of the Lord's rational. (That a "son" is truth may be seen above, n. 489, 491, 533, 1147; also that "Sarah" signifies rational truth, 
n. 2173; and that "Isaac" signifies the Divine rational, n. 1893, 2066, 2083.) The human with every man begins in the inmost of his rational (as before said, n. 2106); and so also the Lord's Human: 
that which was above it was Jehovah Himself, differently from any other man whatever. As the human begins in the inmost of the rational, and as the Lord made all the Human that was with Himself Divine, 
He first made the rational itself so from its inmost, which, when made Divine is represented and signified (as before said) by "Isaac." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2194</b></p><p><b>2194.</b>
'And behold, Sarah your wife will have a son' means the Rational that was to be Divine. This is clear from the meaning of 'a son', also of 'Sarah', and of 'Isaac' as well, who was to be born to her. 
Both 'a son' and 'Sarah', and 'Isaac' too, mean that which is a feature of the Lord's Rational; for '<a href="5011.htm">5011</a>' means truth, see <a href="489.htm">489</a>, <a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="533.htm">533</a>, <a href="1147.htm">1147</a>, 'Sarah' rational truth, <a href="2173.htm">2173</a>, and 'Isaac' the Divine Rational, <a href="1893.htm">1893</a>, <a href="2066.htm">2066</a>, <a href="2083.htm">2083</a>. With everyone the human has its beginnings in the inmost part of the rational, as stated in <a href="2106.htm">2106</a>, so that the Lord's Human too had its beginnings there. That which was above 
it was Jehovah Himself, which is not the case with anyone else at all. Since the human has its beginnings in the inmost part of the rational, and since the Lord made the whole of the human with Him Divine, 
He first made the rational itself Divine from the inmost. And that rational, having been made Divine, is represented and meant, as has been stated, by 'Isaac'. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2194</b>
</p><b>2194.</b>
`Et ecce filius Sarae uxori tuae': quod significet Rationale Divinum futurum, constat ex significatione `filii,' tum `Sarae,' ut et `Isaci' qui ei nasceretur; tam filius, quam Sarah, tum quoque Isacus, 
significat illud quod est Rationalis Domini; quod `filius' verum, videatur n. 489, 491, 533, 1147; quod `Sarah' verum rationale, n. 2173; quodque `Isacus' Rationale Divinum, n. 1893, 2066, 2083.  
Humanum apud unumquemvis hominem incohat in intimo ejus rationalis, ut n. 2106 dictum, ita quoque Humanum Domini; quod supra illud, fuit Ipse Jehovah, secus ac apud alium quemlibet hominem: quia in intimo 
rationalis incohat humanum, et Dominus omne humanum apud se Divinum fecit, ita ipsum rationale primo ab intimo ejus; quod cum Divinum factum, repraesentatur et significatur, ut dictum, per `Isacum.' </p>
