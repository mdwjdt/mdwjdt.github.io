<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5386.</strong>身体的其它地方也有分泌和排泄器官。脑里面有排出粘性物质的心室和乳突。此外各个部位还有腺体，如脑袋里面分泌粘液和唾液的腺体，以及体内的许多其它腺体；还有紧贴皮肤角质层、用来排泄汗液和用尽了的微小物质的无数腺体。在灵界，一般来说，与这些相对应的，是顽固坚持自己意见的灵人，以及在无关紧要的问题上一丝不苟的灵人。在这些灵人中间，有的出现在头顶上的半空中；他们具有这样的性质，他们会细致地探究那些根本无需作出这种探究的问题。因此，他们因背负着简单人的良心，故被称为“良心贩子”。然而，他们并不知道何为真正的良心，因为他们把一切问题都变成良心的问题。事实上，如果一件事稍微受到一点点质疑或怀疑，头脑又专注于此，为此焦虑，那么强化这种怀疑并使之成为沉重负担的想法永远不会缺乏。当这类灵人出现时，他们也在横膈膜之下的腹部造成一种焦虑感。在试探期间，他们也与人同在。我曾与他们交谈过，并且发现他们的思维并没有延伸到对更有用或更重要的问题的任何关注上。他们不能注意它们所提供的理由，因为他们顽固坚持自己的意见。</p>

There are also secretories and excretories in other parts of the body: in the brain there are ventricles and mammillary processes which carry off the phlegmy substances there; and there are also little 
glands everywhere, as the mucous and salivary glands in the head, and very many others in the body, and myriads next the cuticles, by which the sweat and more subtle used-up matters are thrown off. 
To these correspond in the spiritual world-to speak generally-tenacities of opinions, and also conscientious scruples in unimportant matters. Some of these spirits appear at a moderate distance above 
the head, and are such that they raise scruples in matters where there need be none; hence because they burden the consciences of the simple, they are called conscience-mongers. What true conscience 
is, they know not, because they make everything that comes up a matter of conscience; for when any scruple or doubt is suggested, if the mind is anxious and dwells on it, there are never wanting things 
to strengthen the doubt and make it burdensome. When such spirits are present they also induce a sensible anxiety in the part of the abdomen immediately under the diaphragm. They are also present with 
man in temptations. I have talked with them, and noticed that they have not enough extension of thought to acquiesce in the more useful and necessary things; for they were unable to give attention 
to reasons, being tenaciously set in their own opinion. </p>

Elsewhere in the body there are other secretory and excretory organs. In the brain there are ventricles and mamillary processes which drain away viscid substances. In addition to this there are glands 
in all parts, such as those producing mucus and saliva in the head, and very many in the body. Also there are millions next to the skin through which sweat and more minute used matter are excreted. 
Those who in the spiritual world correspond to these are in general spirits who hold on tenaciously to their point of view and also spirits who take a conscientious stand on issues that are not vitally 
important. Some of these are seen midway overhead; their nature is such that they make meticulous enquiries into matters into which no such enquiries at all ought to be made. Consequently, because they 
burden the consciences of simple people they are called 'the conscientious ones'. Yet they have no knowledge of what true conscience is, because they make all issues into matters of conscience. For 
if a thing is subjected to minute questioning or to doubt and the mind is anxiously fixed on such, ideas supporting this attitude and weighing the mind down are never absent. When such spirits are present 
they also bring a feeling of anxiety that registers in the part of the abdomen located immediately beneath the diaphragm. They are also present with a person during temptations. I have talked to 
them and have noticed that their thoughts do not extend to any concern for matters that have greater purpose or that are vitally important. They were incapable of paying any attention to reasons offered 
to them because they persisted in holding on tenaciously to their own opinion. </p>

Sunt etiam alibi in corpore secretoria et excretoria, in cerebro sunt ventriculi et processus mamillares, qui abducunt pituitosa ibi; et praeterea glandulae ubivis, {1} mucosae et salivales in capite, 
et perplures in corpore, ac myriades juxta cuticulas, per quas sudores et obsoleta subtiliora excernuntur; illis correspondent in mundo spirituali in genere tenacitates opinionum, tum quoque conscientiosa 
in rebus non necessariis; apparent aliqui eorum supra caput ad mediam distantiam, qui tales sunt ut scrupulos moveant in rebus in quibus nihil scrupuli esse debet; inde quia gravant conscientias 
simplicium, vocantur conscientiosi, {2} quid vera conscientia, non sciunt, nam {3} in omni quod obvenit, ponunt conscientiam; posito enim aliquo scrupulo aut dubio, si anxia mens sit et inhaeret, nusquam 
desunt confirmantia et sic gravantia; tales cum adsunt, etiam inducunt anxietatem sensibilem parti abdominis proxime sub diaphragmate; adsunt quoque in tentationibus apud hominem; locutus sum cum 
illis, et appercepi quod illis non sit aliqua cogitationum extensio ut acquiescant in utilioribus et necessariis, nam non potuerunt ad rationes attendere quia tenaciter permanebant in sua opinione. </p>
