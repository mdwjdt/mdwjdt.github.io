<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第761节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>761.</strong>前面说过，发生在人身上的属灵试探是恶灵和同他在一起的天使之间的争战，这种争战通常在他的良知中被感受到。关于这争战，当知道，天使不断保护人，阻止恶灵针对他的邪恶。他们甚至保护人内的虚假与邪恶，因为他们非常清楚其虚假与邪恶来自何处，即来自恶灵和魔鬼。人凭自己无法制造任何虚假与邪恶，而是与他同在的恶灵制造了它们，同时使此人相信这些东西源于他。这就是他们的恶毒，而且，一旦他们将这种信念注入进去，并使他信服，就会指控和谴责他，我通过大量经历确认这一点。人若不信主，就无法在这类事上得到启示，因此会将邪恶归给自己，从而变得象那些与他同在的恶灵。这就是人的情形。由于天使清楚这一点，故而在人经历重生的试探期间，他们也保护他的虚假与邪恶，否则他必会屈服。因为人里面无非是邪恶和衍生的虚假，甚至他纯粹是一大团邪恶和衍生的虚假。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]761.</strong> I have already said [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_761/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_741" target=_top>741</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_761/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_751" target=_top>751</a>] that spiritual struggle is a battle inside us between the evil spirits and angels present with us, and that we sense this conflict indistinctly in our conscience.<br />Further vital information about this combat is that angels constantly defend us and deflect the evil that the evil spirits intend against us. They even defend the falsity and evil we have in us, because they know very well where we obtained the falsity and evil: from evil spirits and demons. We never produce anything misguided or wicked out of ourselves. It is the evil spirits with us who produce it and at the same time cause us to believe that it comes from us. Such is their malevolence. What is more, at the same instant that they are filling us with these things and making us believe this way, they are also accusing and condemning us. I can back this claim with many different experiences.<br />Those lacking faith in the Lord cannot receive light dispelling this belief that they are the source of evil, so they adopt the evil as their own and become just like the evil spirits who accompany them. That is the human condition.<br />As angels are aware of this, during the trials of regeneration they even defend our falsity and evil. Otherwise we would suffer defeat, since we have nothing in us that is not evil and therefore false and are accordingly nothing more than a heap and conglomeration of evils and resulting falsities. </p>

That spiritual temptation in man is a combat of the evil spirits with the angels who are with him, and that this combat is commonly felt in his conscience, has been stated before, and concerning this 
combat it should also be known that angels continually protect man and avert the evils which evil spirits endeavor to do to him. They even protect what is false and evil in a man, for they know very 
well whence his falsities and evils come, namely, from evil spirits and genii. Man does not produce anything false and evil from himself, but it is the evil spirits with him who produce it, and at the 
same time make the man believe that he does it of himself. Such is their malignity. And what is more, at the moment when they are infusing and compelling this belief, they accuse and condemn him, as 
I can confirm from many experiences. The man who has not faith in the Lord cannot be enlightened so as not to believe that he does evil of himself, and he therefore appropriates the evil to himself, and 
becomes like the evil spirits that are with him. Such is the case with man. As the angels know this, in the temptations of regeneration they protect also the falsities and evils of a man, for otherwise 
he would succumb. For there is nothing in a man but evil and the falsity thence derived, so that he is a mere assemblage and compound of evils and their falsities. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 761</b></p><p><b>761.</b>
It has been stated already that spiritual temptation when it takes place in someone is a conflict between the evil spirits and the angels residing with that person, and that he ordinarily feels that 
conflict in his conscience. As regards such conflict it should be recognized in addition that the angels are protecting man constantly and are warding off the evils that evil spirits direct against him. 
They protect even the falsities and the evils with a person, for they are fully aware of where the person's falsities and evils come from - from evil spirits and genii. Man in no sense produces any 
falsity and evil from himself. Instead it is the evil spirits residing with him who produce them, and as they do so they also convince him that these originate in himself. Such is the nature of their 
wickedness. And what is more, the moment they instill this into him and convince him, they also accuse and condemn him. This I can confirm from a multitude of experiences. Anyone who has no faith in 
the Lord is incapable of being enlightened in the matter; he inevitably believes that an evil is from himself. Consequently he makes the evil his own and becomes like those evil spirits residing with 
him. Such is the situation with man. And as the angels are aware of it they protect even a person's falsities and evils while he is undergoing the temptations that are part of regeneration. Otherwise 
he would go under, for with man there is nothing but evil and derivative falsity, so that he is just a heap and conglomeration of evils and derivative falsities. </p>

</p><b>761.</b>
Quod tentatio spiritualis apud hominem sit pugna spirituum malorum cum angelis qui apud hominem, et quod illa pugna communiter in ejus conscientia sentiatur, prius dictam est: de qua pugna porro hoc 
sciendum est, quod angeli {1}continue defendant hominem et avertant mala quae mali spiritus ei intendunt; etiam quae falsa sunt et mala apud hominem defendunt, nam norunt optime unde homini falsa et 
mala, nempe quod a malis spiritibus et geniis; homo nusquam producit a se aliquid falsum et malum, sed sunt mali spiritus qui apud eum, qui producunt et simul faciunt homini credere quod ex ipsomet; talis 
est malignitas eorum; et adhuc magis, momento cum infundunt et faciunt credere, etiam accusant et damnant; quod multis experientiis confirmare possum. Homo qui non fidem habet in Dominum, non potest 
illustrari, quin credat quod malum sit ab ipso; quare etiam appropriat sibi malum, et fit similis spiritibus istis malis qui apud eum; ita se res habet cum homine: hoc quia angeli norunt, etiam in 
tentationibus regenerationis falsa et mala hominis defendunt; alioquin succumberet, quia apud hominem nihil nisi quam malum est et inde falsum, sic ut sit malorum et inde falsorum mera congeries et compositio.
