<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3632节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3632.</strong>神序，以及由此衍生的天堂次序终止于人内，终止于与他的身体有关的事物，即他的举止、行动、表情、言语、外在感觉，以及它们的快乐中，而不是超出它们。这类身体事物是次序的终端，也是流注的终端，它们是最远的极限。但流入的内层事物却不是它们在外在事物中所显现的样子，而是具有完全不同的面孔、表情、感觉和快乐。对应关系则教导了内层事物，以及代表的性质，如前所述。它们是不同的，这一事实从由意愿所流出的行为和由思维所流出的言语清楚看出来。身体行为不是它们在意愿中的样子，言语也不是它们在思维中的样子。由此也明显可知，属世行为是从属灵之物流出的，因为意愿之物和思维之物都是属灵的；属灵之物以对应的方式在这些属世行为中呈现出自己的形像，即便它们本身截然不同。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3632</b></p><p><b>3632.</b>
Divine order, and the heavenly order thence derived, are not terminated except in man, in what is of his body, namely, in his gestures, actions, looks, speech, external sensations, and their delights. 
These are the extremes of order, and the extremes of influx, which are then terminated; but the interior things which flow in are not such as they appear in externals, but have altogether a different 
appearance, a different countenance, a different sensation, and a different pleasure. Correspondences teach of what sort these are, and also representations, which have been described. That there is 
such a difference may be seen from the actions which flow from the will, and from the speech which flows from the thought-the actions of the body are not such in the will, nor are the expressions of 
speech such in the thought. Hence also it is manifest that natural acts flow from spiritual, for that which is of the will and of the thought is spiritual; and that these spiritual are effigied in those 
natural acts correspondently, but still differently. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3632</b></p><p><b>3632.</b>
Divine order and consequent heavenly order do not extend beyond man as their furthest limit - beyond the things related to his body, namely his gestures, actions, facial expressions, speech, external 
sensations, and the delights that go with these. Such bodily things are the furthest limits to which order extends and to which influx extends. But the interior things which flow in are not in themselves 
such as they are seen to be in external things but have a totally different face, countenance, sensation, and delight. Correspondences teach the nature of interior things, as do representations, 
dealt with already. The fact that they are different is clear from actions which flow from the will, and from utterances which flow from thought. Actions of the body are not such as they are in the will, 
nor are verbal utterances such as they are in thought. From this it is also evident that natural acts flow from spiritual, since things of the will and those of thought are spiritual; and that spiritual 
things in a correspondential way present a likeness of themselves in natural, even though in themselves they are quite different. </p>

Ordo Divinus et inde caelestis non terminatur quam apud hominem in ejus corporeis, nempe in ejus gestibus, actionibus, vultibus faciei, loquela, sensationibus externis, inque illorum jucundis; haec sunt 
extrema ordinis et extrema influxus, quae tunc finiuntur; sed interiora quae influunt, non sunt talia qualia in externis apparent, sed sunt prorsus alia facie, alio vultu, alia sensatione, et alia 
voluptate; correspondentiae docent qualia sunt, tum quoque repraesentationes, de quibus actum.  Quod alia sint, constare potest ab actionibus quae fluunt a voluntate, et a loquelis quae fluunt a cogitatione; 
actiones corporis non tales sunt in voluntate, et loquelae vocum {1}non tales sunt in cogitatione; inde etiam patet quod naturales actus fluant (c)a spiritualibus, {2}quae enim voluntatis sunt 
et quae cogitationis, spiritualia sunt; et quod effigientur {3}haec in illis correspondenter, sed usque aliter. @1 nec I$ @2 sed quae cogitationis et voluntatis sunt$ @3 illa in his$ </p>
