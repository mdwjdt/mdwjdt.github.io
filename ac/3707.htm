<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3707节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3707.</strong>“你的种必像地上的尘沙”表神圣的属世真理必如同属世良善。这从“种”和“地上的尘沙”的含义清楚可知：“种”是指真理（参看<a href="3706.htm">3706</a>节），因此“你的种”或雅各的种是指神圣的属世真理，因为如前所示，雅各代表主的神圣属世层；“地上的尘沙”是指良善（参看<a href="1610.htm">1610</a>节）。因此，“你的种必像地上的尘沙”在内义上表示神圣的属世真理必如同神圣的属世良善。“地上的尘沙”之所以表示良善，是因为“地”表主的国度，因而表良善，如前所示（<a href="3705.htm">3705</a>节）。故“地上的尘沙”表良善，但表属世良善，因为也如前所示，“地”表主国度较为低级的事物，因而表属世层；而“天”也被提及时，表示内层之物，或理性层之物。这就为何在圣言中，良善的繁殖和真理的增多通篇以“种必如同天上的众星和地上的尘沙”来描述的原因。在那里，“天上的众星”表理性事物，而“地上的尘沙”表属世事物，它们以这种方式增长。至于何谓属世真理如同属世良善，蒙主怜悯，这个问题将在以后予以解释。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3707</b></p><p><b>3707.</b>
And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth. That this signifies that Divine truth natural would be as natural good, is evident from the signification of "seed," as being truth (see above, n. 3706); 
hence "thy seed," or the seed of Jacob, is Divine truth natural, for by Jacob is represented the Lord's Divine natural, as shown above-and from the signification of the "dust of the earth," as being 
good (see n. 1610). Therefore "thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth," signifies in the internal sense that Divine truth natural should be as Divine good natural. That the "dust of the earth" signifies 
good, is because by "earth" is signified the Lord's kingdom, consequently good, as shown above (n. 3705); the "dust of that earth" therefore signifies good, but natural good, because by "earth," 
as also shown above, is signified that which is lower in the Lord's kingdom, thus the natural; while "heaven," when it also is mentioned, signifies that which is interior, or the rational. This is 
the reason why fructification of good and multiplication of truth are expressed in the Word throughout by "seed becoming as the stars of the heavens and as the dust of the earth." By the "stars of the 
heavens" are there signified rational things; and by the "dust of the earth," natural things, which thus increase. What is meant by natural truth being as natural good, will of the Lord's Divine mercy 
be explained hereafter. </p>

'And your seed will be as the dust of the earth' means that Divine natural Truth would be as natural good. This is clear from the meaning of 'seed' as truth, dealt with immediately above in <a href="3706.htm">3706</a>, 'your 
seed' - that is, Jacob's - consequently meaning Divine natural Truth, for as shown above 'Jacob' represents the Lord's Divine Natural; and from the meaning of 'the dust of the earth' as good, dealt 
with in <a href="1610.htm">1610</a>. Consequently 'your seed will be as the dust of the earth' means in the internal sense that Divine natural Truth will be as Divine natural Good. The reason 'the dust of the earths means 
good is that 'the earth' means the Lord's kingdom and accordingly good, as shown just above in <a href="3705.htm">3705</a>. 'The dust of the earth' therefore means good, though natural good since the earth, as also shown in 
that place, means that which is lower in the Lord's kingdom, thus the natural, while heaven when mentioned as well means that which is interior, or the rational. This is why the fruitfulness of good 
and the multiplication of truth are described in various places by means of expressions stating that someone's seed will be as the stars of heaven and as the dust of the earth. 'The stars of heaven' in 
that case means rational concepts, and 'the dust of the earth' natural images, which will increase in this fashion. What is meant by natural truth becoming as natural good will in the Lord's Divine 
mercy be explained later on. </p>

Quod `erit semen tuum sicut pulvis terrae' significet quod Divinum Verum naturale esset sicut bonum naturale, constat a significatione `seminis' quod sit verum, de qua mox supra n. 3706, inde `semen 
tuum' seu Jacobi, est Divinum Verum Naturale, per `Jacobum' enim repraesentari Divinum Naturale Domini, supra ostensum est; et ex significatione `pulveris terrae' quod sit bonum, de qua n. 1610; 
inde `erit semen tuum sicut pulvis terrae' est in sensu interno quod Divinum Verum naturale erit sicut Divinum Bonum naturale.  Quod `pulvis terrae' significet bonum, inde est quia per `terram' significatur 
regnum Domini, {1}proinde bonum, ut mox supra n. 3705 ostensum; pulvis illius terrae (t)est ideo bonum, sed bonum naturale, quia per terram, ut quoque ibi ostensum, significatur id quod 
inferius est in regno Domini, ita naturale, cum caelum, quando quoque nominatur, id quod interius (2)seu rationale:  inde est quod fructificatio boni et multiplicatio veri passim in Verbo exprimatur 
per quod (t)semen erit sicut stellae caelorum, et sicut pulvis terrae; per `stellas caelorum' tunc significantur rationalia, et per `pulverem terrae' naturalia, quae ita crescent.  Quid sit, quod 
verum naturale erit sicut bonum naturale, in sequentibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, explicabitur. @1 et inde bonum amoris$ @2 i est$ </p>
