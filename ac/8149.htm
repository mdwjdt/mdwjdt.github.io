<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8149节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8149.</strong>“和埃及所有的战车”表以及支持从属于它们的虚假的教义事物。这从“法老的战车”的含义清楚可知，“法老的战车”是指支持其它一切虚假所从属的虚假的首要教义事物；因此，“埃及的战车”表示支持从属于它们的虚假的教义事物，如刚才所述（<a href="8148.htm">8148</a>节）。因为王和他的战车表示首要事物，而百姓，也就是“埃及人”及其“战车”表示次要事物。那些过着邪恶生活之人当中的教会教义事物被称为支持虚假的教义事物，尽管它们可能在某种程度上，或多或少包含真理。原因在于，与那些过着邪恶的人同在的真理，只要与这些人在一起，就不是真理；事实上，当被应用邪恶的生活时，它们就脱去了真理的本质，并披上虚假的性质，因为它们看向与它们结合的邪恶。真理不可能与邪恶结合，除非它们被歪曲，这种歪曲是通过曲解，因而通过对它们的扭曲导致的。正因如此，在这些人当中，教会的教义事物被称为支持虚假的教义事物，尽管它们曾是真理。因为这是一条律法或准则：在那些过着邪恶生活的人当中，真理会变得虚假；而在那些过着良善生活的人当中，虚假会变得真实。他们当中的虚假之所以会变得真实，是因为它们被用来与良善保持一致，虚假的粗劣以这种方式被抹去（<a href="8051.htm">8051</a>节）。</p>

And all the chariots of Egypt. That this signifies also the doctrinal things of falsity that are of service to them, is evident from the signification of "the chariots of Pharaoh," as being the chief 
doctrinal things of falsity on which the others depend; consequently by "the chariots of Egypt" are signified the doctrinal things of falsity which are of service to them (of which just above, n. 8148); 
for by a king and his chariots are signified principal things, but by the people, that is, "the Egyptians," and their "chariots," are signified secondary things. The doctrinal things of the church 
with those who are in evil of life are called doctrinal things of falsity, although it is possible that as to some part, greater or less, they are true. The reason is that with those who are in evil 
of life, truths, insofar as such people are concerned, are not truths, because by application to the evil which is of the life they put off the essence of truth, and put on the nature of falsity, for 
they look to evil, with which they conjoin themselves. Truths cannot be conjoined with evil unless they are falsified, which is done by means of wrong interpretations, and thus perversions. Hence it is 
that with such the doctrinal things of the church are called doctrinal things of falsity, even although they had been truths; for it is a canon that with those who are in evil of life truths are falsified, 
and with those who are in good of life falsities are made true. The reason why with these falsities are made true, is that they are applied so as to agree with good, and in this way the crudities 
of the falsity are wiped away (n. 8051). </p>

'And all the chariots of Egypt' means also doctrinal teachings upholding falsity that were subservient to these. This is clear from the meaning of 'Pharaoh's chariots' as the chief doctrinal teachings 
that uphold falsity, to which all others are subordinate, so that 'the chariots of Egypt' means doctrinal teachings upholding falsity that were subservient to them, dealt with immediately above in <a href="8148.htm">8148</a>. 
For 'the king' and 'his chariots' mean the chief things, while 'the people' or the Egyptians and 'their chariots' mean the secondary ones. The Church's teachings among those who lead a life of evil 
are called doctrinal teachings that uphold falsity, even though in part, to a greater or a lesser extent, they may contain the truth. The reason for this is that truths residing with those who lead 
a life of evil are not truths insofar as they exist with those people; for when they are applied to evil in life they lose the essential quality of truth and take on the nature of falsity, because they 
look towards the evil to which they are joined. Truths cannot be joined to evil without being falsified, which comes about through misinterpretations and so perversions of them. So it is that the Church's 
teachings among those people are called doctrinal teachings that uphold falsity, even though they have been truths. For it is a law or principle that truths among people who lead a life of evil 
are made false, and falsities among those who lead a life of good are made true. The reason why falsities among them are made true is that they are used to accord with good, and when that is done the 
crudities of falsity are wiped away, see <a href="8051.htm">8051</a>. </p>

`Et omnes currus Aegypti': quod significet etiam doctrinalia falsi {1}servient illis, constat ex significatione `curruum Pharaonis' quod sint doctrinalia falsi praecipua, a quibus reliqua dependent, 
inde per `currus {2}Aegypti' significantur doctrinalia falsi quae illis inserviunt, de quibus nunc supra n. (x)8148; nam per `regem et illius currus' significantur principalia, at per `populum' seu per 
`Aegyptios,' et `illorum currus,' significantur secundaria.  (s)Doctrinalia Ecclesiae apud illos qui in malo vitae sunt dicuntur doctrinalia falsi, tametsi possunt esse quoad partem, minorem aut majorem, 
vera; causa est quia vera apud illos qui in malo vitae sunt, quantum ad illos, non sunt vera, per applicationem enim ad malum quod vitae, exuunt essentiam veri, et induunt naturam falsi, nam spectant 
ad malum cui se conjungunt; malo conjungi vera nequeunt, nisi haec falsificentur, quod fit per interpretationes sinistras et sic perversiones; inde est quod doctrinalia Ecclesiae apud illos dicantur 
doctrinalia falsi, tametsi vera fuerint; nam canon est quod vera apud illos qui in malo vitae sunt falsificentur; ac falsa apud illos qui in bono vitae sunt verificentur; quod falsa apud hos verificentur, 
est quia applicantur ut concordent bono, {3}sic ipsae ruditates falsi absterguntur, videatur n. 8051.(s) 	@1 inservientia I$ 	@2 Aegyptios$ 	@3 S first wrote et sic them d sic and i after falsi$ </p>
