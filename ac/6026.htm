Verses 28-30. And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to show before him unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. And Joseph harnessed his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, 
to Goshen; and he was seen of him, and fell upon his necks, and wept upon his necks a long while. And Israel said unto Joseph, Let me die this time, after that I have seen thy faces, that thou art yet 
alive. "And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph," signifies the communication of the good of the church with the internal celestial; "to show before him unto Goshen," signifies with respect to the

his father," signifies influx; "to Goshen," signifies into the midst in the natural; "and he was seen of him," signifies perception; "and fell upon his necks," signifies conjunction; "and wept upon

after the noticing of mercy; "that thou art yet alive," signifies the noticing of the consequent life in himself. </p>
