<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4148节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4148.</strong>“雅各回答拉班说，因为我怕呀；我说，恐怕你把你的女儿从我强夺去”表若分离在那良善的自由中，或经那良善自由同意进行，状态的性质，因为就对真理的情感而言，这会造成伤害。这从前文清楚可知，那里论述了对“拉班”所表示的良善这一方来说，在自由中或经它自由同意的分离，此处则对此给出了答复。就内义而言，此处每句话都包含天上的奥秘，只是这些奥秘由于刚才所说的原因（<a href="4136.htm">4136</a>节）而无法详细阐述。显然，它们表示若分离在那良善的自由中或经它自由同意而进行，将会具有的状态性质。在这种情况下，对真理的情感就会受到伤害，这一点由“恐怕你把你的女儿从我强夺去”这句话来表示；因为“女儿”，就是此处的拉结和利亚，表示对真理的情感，如多次所说明的。从接下来的内容可以更清楚地看出这一切的含义。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4148</b></p><p><b>4148.</b>
And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid, for I said, Perchance thou wilt take away thy daughters from me by force. That this signifies the state if the separation were made in the 
freedom of that good, in that it would be injured in respect to the affections of truth, is evident from what precedes, where the separation in freedom on the part of the good signified by "Laban" has 
been treated of, to which an answer is here given. In the internal sense each word involves heavenly arcana, which cannot be expounded for the reason stated just above (n. 4136). It is evident that there 
is here signified the state that would exist if the separation had been effected in the freedom of that good; and that the affections of truth would in that case be injured is signified by the words, 
"Perchance thou wilt take away thy daughters from me by force;" for by "daughters" (here Rachel and Leah) are signified the affections of truth, as has already been frequently shown. How the case 
herein is can be better seen from what now follows. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4148</b></p><p><b>4148.</b>
'Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid; for I said, Perhaps you will take your daughters from me by force' means the nature of the state if the separation had taken place with the free 
consent of that good, in that harm would have been done to it so far as affections for truth were concerned. This is clear from what has gone before where separation with the free consent on the part 
of the good meant by 'Laban' was the subject, and to which an answer is recorded here. All the words used here - each one - include heavenly arcana within them in the internal sense, but these cannot 
be disclosed for the reason discussed just above in <a href="4136.htm">4136</a>. Yet they mean, it is evident, the nature of the state if the separation had taken place with the free consent of that good. And the consideration 
that the affections for truth would in that case be harmed is meant by 'Perhaps you will take your daughters from me by force', for 'daughters', who in this case are Rachel and Leah, means affections 
for truth, as shown many times already. The implications of all this are shown more clearly by what follows next. </p>

</p><b>4148.</b>
`Respondit Jacob et dixit Labani, Quia timui, quia dixi, Forte rapies filias tuas a mecum': quod significet statum si ex libero boni illius separatio facta, quod quoad affectiones veri laederetur, 
constat ex illis quae praecedunt ubi de separatione ex libero a parte boni per `Labanem' significati, actum est, quibus hic respondetur; singula verba involvunt in sensu interno arcana caelestia, 
quae exponi nequeunt ob causam de qua mox supra n. 4136: </p>
<p>quod significetur status si ex libero boni illius separatio facta esset, patet; et quod tunc affectiones veri laederentur, significatur per 
`forte rapies filias tuas a mecum,' per `filias' enim, hic Rachelem et Leam, significantur affectiones veri, ut prius multoties ostensum: quomodo haec se habent, a nunc sequentibus melius constare potest. </p>
