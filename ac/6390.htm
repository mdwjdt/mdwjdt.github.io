<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6390节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6390.</strong>“卧在重驮之间”表行为当中的生命。这从“卧”和“重驮”的含义清楚可知：“卧”是指生命，不过是模糊的生命，只有极少的光；“重驮”是指行为。“重驮”之所以表示这类行为，是因为此处所描述的人行善不是出于对邻之爱的情感，而是出于对自我之爱的情感。从自我之爱的情感所流出的行为就像卑贱驴子所载的重驮，因为这种人属最卑贱的仆人之列。事实上，一切奴役皆出于爱自己爱世界的情感，一切自由皆出于爱主爱邻的情感。原因在于，前一种爱的情感是从用暴力来命令人的地狱流入的，而后一种爱的情感是从主流入的，主从不命令人，而是引导人。由此也明显可知，那些为了回报而行善的人是最低级的仆人，他们的行为是“重驮”。士师记中的“重驮”具有相同的含义：<br />以萨迦的首领与底波拉同来，以萨迦怎样，巴拉也怎样；他在山谷中必被置于脚下，归入流便的种类，以决心为大。你为何坐在重驮之间，听羊群的嘘声呢？（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士5.15.htm">5:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/士5.16.htm">16</a>）<br />此处“以萨迦”表示那些渴望因行为而获得回报的人；“在山谷中被置于脚下”表示以最低级的方式进行服务；“流便的种类”表示那些拥有信之真理的知识之人，此处“以萨迦”所代表的那些人便在他们当中，实际上还在他们之下；“听羊群的嘘声”表示对“羊群”所表示的那些处于仁之良善之人的蔑视；“坐在重驮之间”表示在自我邀功的行为之列。</p>

Lying down between the burdens. That this signifies a life among works, is evident from the signification of "lying down," as being life, but obscure life; and from the signification of "burdens," as 
being works. That "burdens" denote such works is because those here treated of do not do goods from the affection of love toward the neighbor, but from the affection of love toward self. The works which 
flow from the affection of this love are like the burdens carried by the meaner asses, for they belong to the lowest services. For all servitude is from the affection of the love of self and of the 
world, and all freedom is from the affection of love to the Lord and toward the neighbor. The reason is that the affection of the former love flows in from hell, which commands with violence; whereas 
the affection of the latter love flows in from the Lord, who does not command, but leads. Hence again it is plain that they who do what is good for the sake of reward are lowest services, and their 
works are "burdens." The like is signified by "burdens" in the book of Judges: </p>
<p>     The princes in Issachar were with Deborah; and Issachar so with Barak; in the valley he shall be put under his feet, 
in the classes of Reuben great as to the resolves of heart. Why satest thou between the burdens, to hear the hissings of the flocks? (Judg. 5:15, 16); </p>
<p>here also "Issachar" denotes those who desire 
to be rewarded for works; "to be put in the valley under the feet" is to serve in lowest things; the "classes of Reuben" denote those who are in the knowledges of the truth of faith, among whom are those 
here signified by "Issachar," but in a place beneath them; "to hear the hissings of the flocks" denotes contempt from those who are in the good of charity, who are the "flocks;" to "sit between burdens" 
denotes among self-meritorious works. </p>

'Lying down between burdens' means life among works. This is clear from the meaning of 'lying down' as life, but life with little light; and from the meaning of 'burdens' as works. The reason why such 
works are meant by 'burdens' is that the people described here are not motivated, when they perform good deeds, by an affection that goes with love towards the neighbour but by an affection that goes 
with love towards themselves. Works motivated by the second affection are like the burdens carried by lowly asses, for such people are among the most menial servants. All servitude arises out of an 
affection that goes with self-love and love of the world, and all freedom arises out of an affection that goes with love to the Lord and love towards the neighbour. The reason for this is that the first 
affection enters in from hell, which is violently domineering, whereas the second comes from the Lord, who is not domineering but one who leads. This again shows that those who do good for the sake 
of recompense are the lowest-ranking servants, and that their works are 'burdens'. 'Burdens' has a similar meaning in the Book of Judges, </p>
<blockquote>
Princes in Issachar were with Deborah; and as was Issachar, 
so was Barak; in the valley he will be sent under his feet<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> - in the divisions of Reuben, great as to decrees of the heart. Why should you sit between burdens, to hear the hissings of the flocks? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%205:%2015,%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 5: 15, 16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'Issachar' stands for those who wish to receive recompense for their works. 'In the valley being sent under his feet' stands for serving in the lowest ways. 'The divisions 
of Reuben' stands for those who have a knowledge of matters that constitute the truth of faith, among whom - yet placed beneath whom - there are those represented by 'Issachar'. 'Hearing the hissings 
of the flock' stands for contempt on the part of those with whom the good of charity is present, who are meant by 'the flocks'. 'Sitting between burdens' stands for among merit-seeking works.

`Cubans inter sarcinas': quod significet vitam inter opera, constat a significatione `cubare' quod sit vita sed vita obscura; et ex significatione `sarcinarum' quod sint opera; quod sarcinae sint talia 
opera, est quia non ex affectione amoris erga proximum bona faciunt sed ex affectione amoris erga se; opera quae ex hujus amoris affectione fluunt, sunt sicut sarcinae quas viliores asini portant, 
nam  sunt servitia inter vilissima: {1}omne enim servum est ex affectione amoris sui et mundi, ac omne liberum (c)ex affectione amoris in Dominum et erga proximum; causa est quia illius amoris affectio 
influit ab inferno, quod violenter imperat; at hujus amoris affectio a Domino, Qui non imperat sed ducit; inde iterum patet quod qui bonum faciunt remunerationis causa, sint servitia infima, et illorum 
opera `sarcinae'.  Per sarcinas simile significatur in Libro Judicum, Principes ii, Jisaschar cum Debora, et Jisaschar sic cum Barako, in valle mittetur sub pedibus ejus, in classibus Reubenis magni 
statuta cordis: quare sederes inter sarcinas, ad audiendum exsibilationes gregum? v 15, 16; </p>
<p>`Jisaschar' hic quoque pro illis qui pro operibus remunerari volunt; `in valle mitti sub pedibus' pro 
servire in infimis; `classes Reubenis' pro illis qui in cognitionibus veri fidei, inter quos sunt sed in loco infra {2}illos; `audire exsibilationes gregum' pro contemptu ab illis qui in bono charitatis 
sunt, qui sunt `greges'; `sedere inter sarcinas' pro inter opera meritoria. @1 nam sciendum, quod omne servum sit$ @2 alios$ </p>
