<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2228节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>2228．“地上的万族都必因他得福”表凡拥有仁爱者都会因祂得救。这从“得福”的含义清楚可知，“得福”是指被赐予具有天堂来源的一切良善，如前面所解释的（<a href="981.htm">981</a>，<a href="1096.htm">1096</a>，<a href="1420.htm">1420</a>，<a href="1422.htm">1422</a>节）。人若被赐予具有天堂来源的良善，即属天之善和属灵之善，如刚才所述（参看<a href="2227.htm">2227</a>节），也会被赐予永恒的救恩，即得救。“地上的万族”在内义上是指那些拥有爱与仁之善的人，这从“民族”的含义清楚可知，“民族”是指良善（<a href="1159.htm">1159</a>，<a href="1258.htm">1258</a>-<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>，<a href="1416.htm">1416</a>，<a href="1849.htm">1849</a>节）。谁都能清楚看出，“地上的万族”并非指全世界所有人，因为他们当中还有很多不能得救的人。只有那些拥有仁爱，即获得仁爱生命的人才能得救。<br />为了人人都能知晓人死后其救恩的整个情形，现对此作以简要说明。有很多人声称人凭信得救，或照他们的话说，只要有信就能得救。但他们绝大部分并不知道何为信。有的以为信纯粹是思想，有的以为信就是承认应当相信的某事，有的以为信就是应当相信的信的整个教义等等。因此，光是在何为信的认识上，他们就犯了错误，结果在何为使人得救的信上也犯了错误。然而，信并非纯粹的思想，亦非承认应当相信的某事，也不是知道构成信之教义的全部内容。没有人凭这种思想、承认或知道得救，因为它们无法深深地扎根下来，仅止于思想。但使人得救的并非思想，而是此人在世时通过信的认知为自己所获得的生命。这生命会存留下来，而不符合这生命的一切思想则会消失，甚至化为乌有。在天堂，使得人们彼此交往的是他们的生活，而非与人的生活毫无关系的思想。与人的生活无关的思想是虚伪的，会彻底被弃绝。<br />生活一般分为两种，一种是地狱的生活，一种是天堂的生活。地狱的生活通过从自我之爱、因而从对邻之恨所流出的一切意图、思想和行为获得；而天堂的生活则通过属于对邻之爱的一切意图、思想和行为获得。这天堂的生活就是被称为信的一切事物所关注，并凭信的一切事物所获得的生活。由此清楚可知何为信，即信就是仁爱，因为凡被说成是信之教义一部分的一切事物都通向仁爱。它们全都包含在仁爱中，它们也全都源于仁爱。肉身生命结束后，灵魂就是诸如它的爱所是的样子。</p>

All the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him. That this signifies that all who are in charity will be saved by Him, is evident from the signification of being "blessed," as being to be endowed 
with all goods which are from a heavenly origin (as explained n. 981, 1096, 1420, 1422). They who are endowed with goods from a heavenly origin, that is, with both celestial and spiritual goods (concerning 
which just above, n. 2177), are also endowed with eternal salvation, that is, are saved. By "all the nations of the earth" are meant in the internal sense those who are in the good of love and 
of charity, as is evident from the signification of a "nation," as being good (n. 1159, 1258-1260, 1416, 1849). That all men in the whole globe are not meant by "all the nations of the earth," is evident 
to everyone, because there are very many among them who are not saved, but only those who are in charity, that is, who have attained the life of charity. [2] That none may be unaware how the case 
is with the salvation of men after their decease, it shall be briefly stated. There are many who say that man is saved by faith, or, in their words, if he only has faith; but for the most part they 
are those who do not know what faith is. Some suppose that it is mere thought; some that it is an acknowledgment of something to be believed; some that it is the whole doctrine of faith, which is to be 
believed; and others otherwise. Thus in the bare knowledge of what faith is they wander in error; consequently in the knowledge of what that is by which man is saved. Faith, however, is not mere thought, 
nor is it an acknowledgment of something to be believed, nor a knowledge of all things which belong to the doctrine of faith. By these no one can be saved; for they can take root no deeper than 
in the thought, and thought saves no one, but the life which the man has procured for himself in the world by means of the knowledges of faith. This life remains; whereas all thought which does not accord 
with the life perishes, even so as to become none at all. The heavenly consociations are according to lives, and by no means according to thoughts which are not of the life. Thoughts which are not 
of the life are counterfeit, and such are altogether rejected. [3] In general, life is twofold, being on the one hand infernal, on the other heavenly. Infernal life is acquired from all those ends, 
thoughts, and works which flow from the love of self, consequently from hatred against the neighbor; heavenly life, from all those ends, thoughts, and works which are of love toward the neighbor. The 
latter is the life to which all things that are called faith have regard, and which is procured by all things of faith. All this shows what faith is, namely, that it is charity, for to charity all things 
lead which are said to be of the doctrine of faith; in it they are all contained, and from it they are all derived. The soul, after the life of the body, is such as its love is. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2228</b></p><p><b>2228.</b>
'And in him all the nations of the earth will be blessed' means that from Him all who have charity will be saved. This is clear from the meaning of 'being blessed' as being endowed with all goods that 
have a heavenly origin, dealt with in <a href="981.htm">981</a>, <a href="1096.htm">1096</a>, <a href="1420.htm">1420</a>, <a href="1422.htm">1422</a>. People who are endowed with goods from a heavenly origin, that is, with celestial goods and spiritual goods, which have been referred to 
immediately above in <a href="2227.htm">2227</a>, are also endowed with eternal salvation, that is, they are saved. 'All nations of the earth' is used to mean in the internal sense those with whom the goods exist that flow 
from love and charity, as is clear from the meaning of 'nation' as good, dealt with in <a href="1159.htm">1159</a>, <a href="1258.htm">1258</a>-<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>, <a href="1416.htm">1416</a>, <a href="1849.htm">1849</a>. That 'all the nations of the earth' does not mean all people throughout the whole world 
may become clear to anyone, for there are so many among them who are not saved. Only those who have charity, that is, who have acquired the life of charity, are saved. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 So that the whole matter 
of the salvation of people after they have died does not remain hidden from anyone, let a brief discussion of it follow here. There are many who declare that man is saved through faith, or as they 
say, if he merely has faith. But the majority of such people do not know what faith is. Some imagine that it is mere thought; some that it is the acknowledgement of something which ought to be believed; 
others that it is the entire doctrine of faith, which ought to be believed; and others something different again. Thus in their mere knowledge of what faith is they are mistaken, and as a consequence 
they are mistaken as to what it is that saves a person. Faith however is not mere thought; nor is it the acknowledgement of something that ought to be believed; nor is it a knowledge of all that constitutes 
the doctrine of faith. Nobody can be saved by such thought, acknowledgement, or knowledge that cannot send down roots any deeper than thought. Thought does not save anyone, but the life which 
he acquires to himself in the world through the cognitions of faith Such life remains, but all thought that is not in keeping with his life dies away, even to the point of becoming none at all. In 
heaven that which brings people into association with one another is their lives, not thoughts that are not related in any way to a person's life. Thoughts which are unrelated to a person's life are spurious 
and are totally rejected. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In general there are two kinds of life, the first being the life of hell, the second that of heaven. The life of hell is derived from all those intentions, thoughts, 
and deeds that flow from self-love, consequently from hatred against the neighbour. The life of heaven is derived from all those intentions, thoughts, and deeds that belong to love towards the 
neighbour. This heavenly life is that to which all things called faith have regard and is acquired by means of all things of faith. From this it becomes clear what faith is, namely that it is charity, 
for all things that are said to be part of the doctrine of faith lead to charity. Charity embraces them all and from charity they are all derived. After the life of the body, the soul is such as its love is. </p>

Quod `benedicentur in illo omnes gentes terrae' significet quod ab Ipso omnes qui in charitate sunt, salvabuntur, constat a significatione `benedici' quod sit domini omnibus bonis quae sunt a caelesti 
origine, de qua n. 981, 1096, 1420, 1422: qui donantur bonis a caelesti origine, hoc est, bonis caelestibus et bonis spiritualibus, de quibus mox supra n. (x)2227, illi quoque donantur salute aeterna, 
hoc est, salvantur: per `omnes gentes terrae' intelliguntur in sensu interno illi qui in bonis amoris et charitatis sunt, ut constat a significatione `gentis' quod sit bonum, [de qua] n. 1159, 1258-1260, 
1416, 1849: quod per `omnes gentes terrae' non significentur omnes in universo terrarum orbe, constare potest cuivis, quia permulti inter illos sunt qui non salvantur, sed modo illi qui in charitate 
sunt, hoc est, qui charitatis vitam adepti sunt.  [2] Ne quemquam lateat quomodo se habet cum salvatione hominum post decessum, paucis dicendum; sunt plures qui dicunt quod salvetur homo per fidem 
aut, ut aiunt, si modo fidem habeat, sed inter illos plurima pars est qui non sciunt quid fides; putant aliqui quod sit mera cogitatio, aliqui quod sit agnitio alicujus credendi, alii quod sit tota 
doctrina fidei, quae credenda, alii aliter; ita in sola cognitione quid sit fides, errant, consequenter in eo quid sit quo salvetur homo: sed usque non est mera cogitatio, nec est agnitio credendi, 
nec cognitio omnium quae sunt doctrinae fidei; ex illis nemo salvari potest, nam non altius radicem possunt agere quam in cogitationem; cogitatio non aliquem salvat, sed est vita quam sibi in mundo comparavit 
per cognitiones fidei; haec vita manet, at omnis cogitatio quae non convenit vitae ejus, perit, usque adeo ut fiat nulla; consociationes caelestes sunt secundum vitas et nusquam secundum cogitationes 
quae non sunt vitae; cogitationes quae non sunt vitae, sunt simulatoriae quae prorsus rejiciuntur: [3] in genere duplex est vita, una infernalis, altera caelestis; vita infernalis contrahitur 
ex omnibus illis finibus, cogitationibus et operibus quae fluunt ex amore sui, consequenter ex odio contra proximum; vita caelestis ex omnibus illis finibus, cogitationibus et operibus quae sunt amoris 
erga proximum; haec vita est quam spectant omnia quae `fides' vocantur, et comparatur per omnia fidei; inde constare potest quid fides {1}, nempe quod sit charitas, nam ad illam ducunt omnia quae doctrinae 
fidei vocantur, in illa sunt omnia illa, et ex illa derivantur omnia illa: anima {2} post vitam corporis [talis] est qualis ejus amor. </p>
