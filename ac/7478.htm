<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7478节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7478.</strong>有一次，当提到主时，我发现这些灵人的谦卑如此内在和深沉，以至于无法形容。他们的谦卑包含这样的想法：他们凭自己身陷地狱；因此，他们完全不配仰望主，因为主是圣洁本身。由他们的信仰所生的这种想法对他们的影响如此深刻，以致他们可以说有些失常，这使得他们不断屈膝下跪，直到主把他们扶起来，这时，可以说把他们从地狱中拉出来。当如此从谦卑当中走出来时，他们就充满良善和爱，由此充满内心的喜乐。当如此谦卑自己时，他们并不面向主，因为这时他们不敢这样做，而是转向别处。我周围的灵人说，他们从来没有见过这样的谦卑。</p>

Once when the Lord was mentioned, I saw that those spirits humbled themselves so inmostly and profoundly that it cannot be described, for in their humiliation they had the thought that of themselves 
they are in hell, and that thus they are altogether unworthy to look to the Lord, who is the Holy itself. They were so profoundly in this thought from faith that they were as it were out of themselves, 
and in it they remained on their knees until the Lord lifted them up, and then as it were drew them out from hell. When they thus emerge from humiliation, they are full of good and of love, and hence 
of joy of heart. When they so humble themselves they do not turn the face to the Lord, for this they dare not then do, but turn it away. The spirits who were around me said that they never saw such 
humiliation. </p>

Once when the Lord was mentioned I saw that those spirits adopted a humbled attitude, so deep and profound as to be indescribable. For in their humility their thought was that if left to themselves they 
were in hell, which being so they were totally unworthy of setting eyes on the Lord, who is Holiness itself. This thought arising from their belief affected them so profoundly that they were so to 
speak beside themselves, and it kept them on their knees until the Lord raised them up and so to speak pulled them out of hell. When they accordingly rise from that humbled condition those spirits are 
full of goodness and love, and consequently of heartfelt joy. But when they adopt that humbled attitude they do not, because they dare not, turn their faces to the Lord; instead they turn them away. 
Spirits who were around me said that they had never seen any humility like it. </p>

Quondam cum nominabatur Dominus, vidi quod spiritus illi humiliarent se tam intime et {1} profunde ut describi nequeat; in humiliatione enim eorum erat illis cogitatio, quod illi ex se in inferno sint, 
et quod sic prorsus indigni ut spectent ad Dominum, Qui Ipsum Sanctum est; in illa cogitatione ex fide ita profunde {2}erant, ut essent quasi extra se, inque illa {3}permanserunt super genubus, usque 
dum Dominus elevaret illos, et tunc quasi extraheret ab inferno; cum sic ex humiliatione emergunt, sunt pleni bono et amore, et inde gaudio cordis.  Cum ita se humiliant, non faciem convertunt ad 
Dominum, hoc enim tunc non audent, sed {4}avertunt.  Spiritus qui circum me erant dicebant quod talem humiliationem nusquam viderint. 	@1 i tam$ 	@2 sunt, ut sint$ 	@3 permanent$ 	@4 aversi$ </p>
