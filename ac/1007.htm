<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1007节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1007.</strong>“向人”表通过他的全部意愿，“向人的兄弟”表通过他的全部觉知。这从“人”的含义清楚可知，因为人的本质和生命就是他的意愿，事实上，意愿的性质就决定了这个人的性质；也从“人的兄弟”的含义可知，因为居于人内的觉知被称为“人的兄弟”，如前所述（<a href="367.htm">367</a>节）。无论居于那里的觉知是真还是假，它都被称为“人的兄弟”。事实上，觉知被称为“人”（<a href="158.htm">158</a>，<a href="265.htm">265</a>节）和意愿的兄弟（<a href="367.htm">367</a>节）。污秽的意愿和污秽的觉知在此被称为“人”和“人的兄弟”，是因为此处的主题是亵渎，在天堂，只是提及亵渎，因而有亵渎的表现都是不能容忍的，会立即被厌恶地拒绝。因此，这里采用了相对温和的表述。本节经文的含义可以说以模棱两可的方式被表述出来，这是为了防止天堂里的那些人知道这一节包含这类事物。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1007.</strong> At the hand of a human means by everything in that person's will, and at the hand of a man, one's brother, means by everything in the person's intellect. This is established by the symbolism of a human, because the essential nature and life of human beings is their will, although the character of the will determines what kind of people they are. It is also established by the symbolism of a man, one's brother. Our intellectual side is called a man and brother, as shown above in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1007/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_367" target=_top>367</a>.{*1} Whether it is a true intellect, a sham one, or a misguided one, it is still called a man and brother, because the intellect is called a man (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1007/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_158" target=_top>158</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1007/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_265" target=_top>265</a>) and the brother of the will (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1007/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_367" target=_top>367</a>).<br />The reason the terms a human and a man, a brother, are used here to refer to a polluted will and polluted intellect is that the current passage is talking about profanation. Heaven cannot bear to hear profanation mentioned or see it represented without rejecting it vigorously and immediately. That is why such mild words appear here and why the meaning of the words in this verse is fairly ambiguous: so that heaven need not even see that this is the burden of the passage.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The passage Swedenborg cites here, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1007/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_367" target=_top>367</a>, does not, strictly speaking, give the intellect as the symbolism of brotherhood; rather, it identifies faith and charity as symbolic brothers. However, the intellect is in several passages correlated with men and with faith, so by extension the intellect apparently may be considered to be included under the symbolism of a brother. See, for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1007/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_476" target=_top>476</a>, where the symbolism of the male as the intellect and thus as a symbol of "the qualities of faith" is mentioned. A similar extrapolation is necessary when <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1007/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_367" target=_top>367</a> is cited below in support of the symbolism of the intellect as the brother of the will. For more on the complex and variable meaning of the sexes in Swedenborg's theology, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1007/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_915" target=_top>915</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1007/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1468" target=_top>1468</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1007/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4434#subsection-2-9" target=_top>4434:9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1007/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4823#subsection-2-2" target=_top>4823:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1007/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5198" target=_top>5198:1</a>.

From the hand of man [homo]. That this is from all of his will, and that "from the hand of the "brother man" [viri fratris] is from all of his intellectual, is evident from the signification of "man"-for 
the essential and life of man is his will, and such as the will is, such is the man-and from the signification of a "brother man." The intellectual in man is called "brother man" as shown before 
(n. 367). Whether it be a true intellectual, a spurious intellectual, or a false intellectual, it is still called a "brother man"; for the understanding is called "man" [vir] (n. 158, 265), and the "brother" 
of the will (n. 367). "Man [homo]" and "man [vir] brother" are here mentioned, and the unclean will and unclean intellectual are so called, because profanation is here treated of, no mention or 
representation of which is tolerated in heaven, but is at once rejected. For this reason such mild terms are here used, and the meaning of the words of this verse is in a manner ambiguous, that it may 
not be known in heaven that such things are contained in it. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1007</b></p><p><b>1007.</b>
'At the hand of man' means from his entire will, and 'at the hand of brother man' from his entire understanding. This is clear from the meaning of 'man' (homo), for the essential element and life of 
a person is his will - indeed the character of the will determines that of the person; and from the meaning of 'brother man' (vir), for where the understanding resides in man it is called 'brother man', 
as shown already in <a href="367.htm">367</a>. Whether the understanding residing there is true, spurious, or false, it is still called 'brother man'. In fact the understanding is called 'a man' (vir), <a href="158.htm">158</a>, <a href="265.htm">265</a>, and 'the 
brother' of the will, <a href="367.htm">367</a>. The reason why a defiled will and a defiled understanding are here called 'a man' (homo) and 'brother man' (vir) is that the subject here is profanation, the mere mention 
and consequent representation of which is not tolerated in heaven but instantly rejected with disgust. This is why such mild expressions are employed here. The sense of the words of the verse can be taken 
two different ways so to speak, so as to prevent those in heaven knowing that this verse contains such matters. </p>

'E manu hominis' quod sit ab omni ejus voluntario, et 'e manu viri fratris' quod sit ab omni ejus intellectuali, constat a significatione 'hominis,' nam essentiale et vita hominis est ejus voluntas, 
sed qualis voluntas talis homo; et a significatione 'viri fratris,' intellectuale apud hominem vocatur 'vir frater,' quod ostensum prius n. 367; sive intellectuale verum sit, sive intellectuale spurium, 
sive intellectuale falsum, usque vocatur 'vir frater,' intellectus {1} enim vocatur 'vir,' n. 158, 265, et 'frater' voluntatis, n. 367.  Homo et vir frater hic dicitur, ac ita vocatur spurcum voluntarium 
et spurcum intellectuale, ex causa quia hic de profanatione agitur, cujus mentio et inde repraesentatio non toleratur in caelo sed ilico respuitur, ideo hic tam mites voces, tum quoque verborum 
hujus versus ambiguus quasi sensus, ut ne vel sciatur in caelo quod talia hic contineantur.   	@1 From next line frater voluntatis it seems that intellectus here is genitive.$ </p>
