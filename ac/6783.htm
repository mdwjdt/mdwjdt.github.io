<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6783节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6783.</strong>“他说，今日你们为何来得这么快呢”表对现在确定结合的一种觉知。这从“说”和“来得快”的含义清楚可知：在圣言的历史中，“说”是指觉知，如前面频繁所述；“来得快”是指确定结合。因为“快”表示确定（参看<a href="5284.htm">5284</a>节）；“来”是指结合（<a href="6782.htm">6782</a>节）。此处所指的确定结合并非通过女儿们很快来到她们父亲来实现的，而是通过“摩西”所代表的从神来的律法所拥有的真理实现的。这就是所觉知到的东西。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6783</b></p><p><b>6783.</b>
And he said, Wherefore hasted ye to come today? That this signifies perception that now conjunction was sure, is evident from the signification of "saying," in the historicals of the Word, as being perception 
(of which often above); and from the signification of "hasting to come," as being sure conjunction. (That "to hasten" denotes what is sure, see n. 5284; and that "to come" is conjunction, n. 
6782.) Here sure conjunction is not meant by the daughters hasting to come to their father, but by the truth which is of the law from the Divine, which is represented by Moses: this is what was perceived. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6783</b></p><p><b>6783.</b>
'And he said, Why have you hastened to come today?' means a perception that now it was a certain joining together. This is clear from the meaning of 'said', in the historical narratives of the Word, 
as perception, dealt with often; and from the meaning of 'hastening to come' as a certain joining together. For the meaning of 'hastening' as certainty, see <a href="5284.htm">5284</a>, and for 'coming' as a joining together, 
immediately above in <a href="6782.htm">6782</a>. What is meant here is not a certain joining together that was effected through the daughters' hastening to come to their father but one that was effected through truth that 
the law from God possessed, represented by 'Moses'. This is what was perceived. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 6783</b>
</p><b>6783.</b>
`Et dixit, Quapropter festinastis venire hodie?': quod significet perceptionem quod nunc certa conjunctio, constat ex significatione `dixit' in historicis Verbi, quod sit perceptio, de qua saepius; 
et ex significatione `festinare venire' quod sit certa conjunctio; quod `festinare' sit certum, videatur n. 5284, et quod `venire' sit conjunctio, mox supra n. 6782; (m)hic non intelligitur certa conjunctio 
per quod filiae festinaverint venire ad patrem suum, sed per verum quod legis a Divino, quod per Mosen repraesentatur; hoc est quod perceptum.(n) </p>
