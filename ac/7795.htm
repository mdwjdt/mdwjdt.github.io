<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7795节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7795.</strong>“使我的奇事在埃及地多起来”表好叫他们能确证这一事实：他们没有信，而是被邪恶主宰。这从“神迹”和“奇事”的含义清楚可知，在埃及所行的“神迹”和“奇事”是指荒凉的阶段和随之对他们被邪恶主宰的确证（<a href="7633.htm">7633</a>节）。因为所有这些“奇事”表示教会里那些熟知关于诸如属于信的那类事物的记忆知识，然而却过着邪恶生活的人所经历的同样多的荒凉阶段。由于他们就是那些在来世侵扰正直人的人，故此处表示的是他们现在的状态（<a href="7465.htm">7465</a>节）。这些“奇事多起来”表示这些状态的连续阶段。之所以有如此多的阶段，是为了叫恶人确证这一事实：他们被邪恶主宰；也是为了将那些过着邪恶生活之人的状态启示给善人（<a href="7633.htm">7633</a>节）。若不是由于这些原因，恶人就会毫不迟延地被诅咒，并且不用经历如此多连续的状态变化就被下入地狱。 <br />恶人在被诅咒并下入地狱之前会经历众多状态，这在世上完全不为人知。人们以为人要么立刻被诅咒，要么立刻得救，这一切无需任何过程就能完成。但事实并非如此。在那里掌权的是公道，没有人被诅咒，直到他自己知道，并从内心确信他被邪恶主宰，他在天堂是完全不可能的。他自己的邪恶也向他显明，正如主在路加福音中所说的：<br />掩盖的事，没有不露出来的；隐藏的事，没有不被人知道的。因此，你们在暗中所说的，将要在明处被人听见；在内室附耳所说的，将要在房顶上被人宣扬。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路12.2.htm">12:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路12.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路12.9.htm">9</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.26.htm">10:26</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可4.22.htm">4:22</a>）<br />更重要的是，这个人也被警告停止作恶。但当他由于被邪恶主宰而无法做到时，通过歪曲真理和伪装良善作恶的能力就从他那里被夺走。这种能力分一个接一个的阶段被移除，最终到来的是诅咒和下入地狱。当他进入其生命的邪恶时，这一切就会发生。<br />生命的邪恶就是意愿和由此而来的思维的邪恶。也就是说，这就是他的内在品质，并且如果法律，或对丧失财富、地位，甚至生命的惧怕不阻碍他，这也会是他外在的品质。死后跟随每个人的，是他意愿和思维的生命，而不是他的外在生命，除非这外在生命是从内在生命发出的。因为人外表会假装反面；因此，当一个人死后在外在事物上经历荒凉时，他在意愿和思维上的品质是什么样就变得显而易见了。每个恶人都通过荒凉的各个阶段而沦落到这种状态；因为在来世，一切荒凉都从外在发展到内在。由此可见来世的公正是何性质，以及一个恶人在被诅咒之前的过程是何性质。由此明显可知，“使我的奇事在埃及地多起来”表示好叫恶人能确证这一事实：他们没有信，而是被邪恶主宰。至于被邪恶主宰的人没有信，可参看前文（<a href="7778.htm">7778</a>节）。</p>

That My wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt. That this signifies that it may be confirmed that they had been in no faith, but in evil, is evident from the signification of the "wonders" and 
"signs" that were done in Egypt, as being vastations and consequent confirmations that they were evil (n. 7633); for these "wonders" signified so many degrees of the vastation of those who within the 
church had been in the memory-knowledge of such things as are of faith, and yet had lived evilly; and because these are they who infest the upright in the other life, it is their state now which is 
here signified (n. 7465). By these "wonders being multiplied" are signified the successive degrees of their states. The reason why there are so many degrees is in order that the evil may be confirmed 
in the fact that they are in evil; and also that the good may be enlightened concerning the state of those within the church who have lived evilly (n. 7633). Except for these reasons, the evil might be 
condemned and let down into hell without so many successive changes of states.  [2] That before the evil are condemned and let down into hell they undergo so many states is altogether unknown in the 
world. It is believed that man is at once either condemned or saved, and that this is effected without any process; but the case is otherwise. Justice reigns there, and no one is condemned until he 
himself knows, and is inwardly convinced, that he is in evil, and that it is utterly impossible for him to be in heaven. His own evils are also laid open to him, according to the words of the Lord in 
Luke: </p>
<p>     There is nothing covered up, that shall not be revealed; or hidden, that shall not be known. Wherefore whatsoever ye have said in the darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye 
have spoken in the ear in the bed chambers shall be proclaimed upon the housetops (Luke 12:2-3; Matt. 10:26-27; Mark 4:22); </p>
<p>and what is more, he is also warned to desist from evil; but when he cannot 
do this because of the dominion of evil, the power is then taken away from him of doing evil by falsifications of truth and pretenses of good, which is effected successively from one degree to another, 
and finally condemnation follows and the letting down into hell. This takes place when he comes into the evil of his life. [3] The evil of the life is evil of the will and of the thought thence 
derived; thus it is the man's inward quality and what would be his quality outwardly if he were not hindered by the laws, and likewise by fears of the loss of gain, of honor, of reputation, and of life. 
This is the life which follows every man after death, but not the outward life, except that which proceeds from the inward life; for in outward things a man pretends what is contrary; and therefore 
when a man after death is being vastated in respect to outward things, it then plainly appears what had been his quality both in will and in thought. To this state every evil person is reduced by means 
of degrees of vastation, for all vastation in the other life advances from outward to inward things. From all this it can be seen what is the nature of the justice in the other life, and what the nature 
of the process before an evil person is condemned. From this it is evident that by "My wonders being multiplied in the land of Egypt," is signified that the evil may be confirmed in the fact that 
they have been in no faith, but in evil. (That they who are in evil have no faith, see above, n. 7778.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7795</b></p><p><b>7795.</b>
'So that My wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt' means in order that they may receive corroboration that they have had no faith but are ruled by evil. This is clear from the meaning of the 
wonders and signs that were performed in Egypt as stages of vastation and consequent corroborations that they are ruled by evil, dealt with in <a href="7633.htm">7633</a>. For all those wonders were signs of an equal number 
of stages in the vastation undergone by those within the Church who had been acquainted with such things as are matters of faith and yet had led an evil life. And since these are the ones who molest 
the upright in the next life their state now is what is meant here, <a href="7465.htm">7465</a>. 'Multiplying these wonders means the consecutive stages of those states. The reason why there are so many stages is that they 
serve to corroborate for the evil that they are ruled by evil and also to enlighten the good regarding the state of those within the Church who have led an evil life, <a href="7673.htm">7673</a>. If these reasons had not stood 
in the way the evil could have been damned without delay and let down into hell without going through so many consecutive changes of states. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that the evil pass through so many states 
before they are damned and let down into hell is completely unknown in the world. People think that a person is either damned or saved immediately, and that this is done without his having to go through 
anything. But the truth of the matter is different from that. Justice reigns there; no one is damned before he himself knows and is inwardly convinced that he is ruled by evil and cannot by any 
means have his being in heaven. His evils are also made plain to him, as accords with the Lord's words in Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
Nothing has been hidden that will not be revealed, or concealed that will not be made 
known. Therefore whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light; and what you have spoken in the ear in bedchambers will be proclaimed on the housetops. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2012:2,%203,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 12:2, 3, 9</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2010:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 10:16</a>; 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%204:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 4:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And what is more, that person is also warned to refrain from evil. But when he cannot do so because he is ruled by evil the power to do ill through falsifications of truth and semblances 
of good is taken away from him. It is removed in stages, one after another; and eventually damnation follows, and being let down into hell, which happens when he comes into the evil of his life. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
The evil of a person's life is evil constituting his will and consequently his thought. That is, it is what he is like inwardly, and would be like outwardly if laws did not stand in the way, or the 
fear that he might lose wealth, position, reputation, and even life. The life of his will and thought is what follows everyone after death, not his outward life, unless it emanates from his inward life. 
For outwardly a person feigns the opposite of his inner self; therefore when after death he undergoes vastation of externals, what he has been like in both will and thought made evident. This state 
is what every evil person is reduced to through the stages of vastation; for all vastation in the next life moves from externals to internals. All this shows what justice is like in the next life and 
what kind of experiences an evil person goes through before he is damned.  </p>
<p>From this it is evident that 'multiplying My signs in the land of Egypt' means in order that they may receive corroboration 
that they have no faith but are ruled by evil. Regarding the absence of faith in those ruled by evil, see above in <a href="7778.htm">7778</a>. </p>

`Propterea ut multiplicari prodigia Mea in terra Aegypti': quod significet ut confirmetur quod in nulla fide fuerint, sed in malo, constat ex significatione `prodigiorum et signorum' quae facta sunt 
in Aegypto, quod {1}sint vastationes et inde confirmationes quod in malo sint, de qua n. 7633; `prodigia' enim illa significabant totidem {2}gradus vastationis illorum qui intra Ecclesiam in scientia 
{3}talium quae fidei fuerunt et tamen vixerunt male, et quia illi sunt qui probos in altera vita infestant, est status illorum {4}nunc qui hic significatur, n. 7465; per `multiplicari illa prodigia' 
{5}significantur gradus successivi illorum statuum; causa quod {6}totidem gradus sint, est ut confirmentur mali quod in malo sint, et quoque ut boni illustrentur de statu illorum qui intra Ecclesiam male 
vixerunt, n. 7633; nisi forent illae causae, potuissent mali absque tot statuum mutationibus successivis ilico damnari et demitti in infernum. 	2 Quod mali antequam damnantur (c)et mittuntur in infernum, 
subeant tot status, prorsus ignotum est in mundo; creditur quod homo statim vel damnetur vel salvetur, et quod hoc fiat absque omni processu; sed res aliter se habet; justitia ibi regnat; non 
damnatur aliquis priusquam ipse scit ac interius evictus est quod in malo sit, et quod prorsus in caelo esse nequeat; aperiuntur {7}quoque illi mala sua, secundum Domini verba apud Lucam, Nihil occultatum 
est quod non revelabitur, aut absconditum quod non cognoscetur: ideo quaecumque in tenebris dixeritis, in luce audientur; et quod in aurem locuti fueritis in cubiculis, praedicabitur super tectis, 
xii 2, 3, 9; Matth. x 26; Marc. iv 22; </p>
<p>et {8}quod magis, etiam (x)admonetur ut a malo desistat, sed cum hoc nequit propter dominium mali, tunc adimitur illi potentia malum faciendi per falsificationes 
veri et simulationes boni, quod fit successive ab uno {9}gradu in alterum, et tandem sequitur damnatio, ac {10}demissio in infernum; hoc fit cum venit in {11}malum (t)suae vitae. 	3 Malum vitae 
est malum voluntatis et cogitationis {12}inde; ita qualis homo est interius, et qualis foret exterius, si non obstarent leges, nec timores jacturae lucri, honoris, famae, et quoque vitae; illa est vita 
quae unumquemvis {13}sequitur post mortem; non autem {14}vita externa, nisi quae procedit ex interna; homo enim in externis simulat contrarium; quare cum {15}homo post mortem quoad externa vastatur, 
tunc patet qualis fuit et voluntate et cogitatione; ad hunc statum unusquisque malus per vastationis gradus redigitur, omnis enim vastatio in altera vita progreditur ab externis ad interna; ex his constare 
potest qualis justitia est in altera vita, et {16}qualis processus antequam damnatur malus.  Inde patet quod per `multiplicari prodigia Mea in terra Aegypti' significetur ut confirmentur quod 
in nulla fide fuerint, sed in malo; quod illis qui in malo nulla fides sit, videatur supra n. 7778. 	@1 fuerint ut cognoscerent mali$ 	@2 status$ 	@3 doctrinalium$ 	@4 quos significabant$ 	@5 significatur
