<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1173节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1173.</strong>创世记10:8，9.古实又生宁录。他开始成为地上的勇士。他在耶和华面前是个猎取的勇士；所以俗语说，像宁录在耶和华面前是个猎取的勇士。<br />和前面一样，“古实”在此表对属灵和属天事物的内在认知。“宁录”表那些使内在敬拜变得外在之人，因而表这类外在敬拜。“古实又生宁录”表那些具有对内在事物的认知之人是这类敬拜的发起者。“他开始成为地上的勇士”表这类宗教信仰在教会中变得更为普遍，“地”是指教会，和前面一样。“他在耶和华面前是个猎取的勇士”表他说服了很多人。“所以俗语说，像宁录在耶和华面前是个猎取的勇士”表由于这么多人被说服，所以这类言辞成为俗语。另外，它还表这类宗教信仰很容易迷惑人们的心智。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1173.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1173/bible_king-james-version_genesis_10_8-9" target=_top>Genesis 10:8-9</a>. And Cush fathered Nimrod; he began to be mighty on the earth. He was mighty in hunting before the face of Jehovah. For this reason there was a saying: "Like Nimrod, mighty in hunting before the face of Jehovah."<br />Cush here as before symbolizes the knowledge of spiritual and heavenly attributes on a fairly deep level. Nimrod symbolizes those who made internal worship external, and so he symbolizes this kind of external worship. Cush fathered Nimrod means that people who possessed a knowledge of deeper things founded this kind of worship. He was mighty on the earth means that this kind of religion grew rife in the church; the earth is the church, as before. He was mighty in hunting before the face of Jehovah means that this religion persuaded many people. For this reason there was a saying: "Like Nimrod, mighty in hunting before the face of Jehovah," means that since so many people were swayed, this became a stock phrase; a further meaning is that this kind of religion ensnares people's minds very easily. </p>

Verses 8, 9. And Cush begat Nimrod; he began to be a mighty one in the earth. He was mighty in hunting before Jehovah; wherefore it was said, As Nimrod mighty in hunting before Jehovah. By "Cush" are 
signified here as before, interior knowledges of things spiritual and celestial; by "Nimrod" are signified those who made internal worship external; thus by "Nimrod" is signified such external worship. 
"Cush begat Nimrod," means that they who had knowledges of interior things instituted such worship. He was "a mighty one in the earth," signifies that such a religion prevailed in the church, "the 
earth" being the church, as before. "He was mighty in hunting before Jehovah," signifies that he persuaded many; "wherefore it was said, As Nimrod mighty in hunting before Jehovah," signifies that because 
so many were persuaded, such a form of speech became proverbial; and further, it signifies that such a religion easily captivates the minds of men. </p>

Verses 8, 9 And Cush begot Nimrod. He began to be a mighty man in the land. He was mighty in hunting before Jehovah; therefore it used to be said, Like Nimrod, mighty in hunting before Jehovah. </p>
<p>Here, 
as previously, 'Cush' means interior cognitions of spiritual and celestial things. 'Nimrod' means those who made internal worship external, and so means such external worship. 'Cush begot Nimrod' 
means that those who had cognitions of interior things were the instigators of such worship. 'He was a mighty man in the land' means that this kind of religion in the Church became more prevalent - 'land' 
is the Church, as previously. 'He was mighty in hunting before Jehovah' means that he persuaded many people. 'Therefore it used to be said, Like Nimrod, mighty in hunting before Jehovah' means that 
since so many were being persuaded this became a proverbial expression. In addition to this it means that such a religion easily captivates people's minds. </p>

Vers. 8, 9.  Et Cush genuit Nimrodum; is coepit esse potens in terra.  Is fuit potens venatione coram Jehovah; propterea dicebatur, Sicut Nimrod potens venatione coram Jehovah.  Per 'Cush' significantur 
hic, ut prius, cognitiones interiores rerum spiritualium et caelestium:  per 'Nimrodum' significantur illi qui internum cultum fecerunt externum; ita per Nimrodum significatur talis externus cultus; 
'quod Cush genuerit Nimrodum' est quod qui cognitiones interiorum habuerunt, talem cultum instituerint:  'is fuit potens in terra' significat quod talis religio in Ecclesia invaluit; 'terra' est Ecclesia, 
ut prius:  'is fuit potens venatione coram Jehovah' significat quod multis persuaserit:  'propterea dicebatur, Sicut Nimrod potens venatione coram Jehovah' significat, quia tam multi persuadebantur, 
quod talis formula sollemnis facta, et porro significat quod talis religio facile animos hominum captet. </p>
