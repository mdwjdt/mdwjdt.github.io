A continuation of the subject of situation, place, distance, and time, in the other life, will be found at the end of this chapter.      CHAPTER 11.            1. And the whole earth was of one lip, 
and their words were one.      2. And it came to pass when they journeyed from the east, that they found a valley in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there.      3. And they said a man to his fellow, 
Come, let us make bricks, and let us burn them to a burning. And they had brick for stone, and bitumen had they for mortar.      4. And they said, Come, let us build us a city and a tower, and 
its head in heaven; and let us make us a name, lest peradventure we be scattered upon the faces of the whole earth.      5. And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of man 
were building.      6. And Jehovah said, Behold, the people are one, and they all have one lip, and this is what they begin to do; and now nothing will be withholden from them of all which they have 
thought to do.      7. Come, let us go down, and there confound their lip, that they hear not a man the lip of his fellow.      8. And Jehovah scattered them from thence upon the faces of all the earth; 
and they left off to build the city.      9. Therefore He called the name of it Babel, because there did Jehovah confound the lip of all the earth; and from thence did Jehovah scatter them upon 
the faces of all the earth.      10. These are the births of Shem: Shem was a son of a hundred years, and begat Arpachshad, two years after the flood.      11. And Shem lived after he begat Arpachshad 
five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.      12. And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and begat Shelah.      13. And Arpachshad lived after he begat Shelah four hundred and three 
years, and begat sons and daughters.      14. And Shelah lived thirty years, and begat Eber.      15. And Shelah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.  
    16. And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg.      17. And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.      18. And Peleg lived 
thirty years, and begat Reu.      19. And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.      20. And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug.     
 21. And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.      22. And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor.      23. And Serug lived after he begat Nahor 
two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.      24. And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah.      25. And Nahor lived after he begat Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begat 
sons and daughters.      26. And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.      27. And these are the births of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.  
    28. And Haran died upon the faces of Terah his father, in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.      29. And Abram and Nahor took them wives; the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; 
and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. 30. And Sarai was barren, she had no offspring.      31. And Terah took Abram his son; and 
Lot the son of Haran, his son's son; and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came even unto 
Haran, and stayed there.      32. And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years; and Terah died in Haran. </p>

De situ, loco, distantia, et tempore, in altera vita, videatur ad finem hujus capitis continuatio. </p>
<p>                            CAPUT XI 	1.  ET fuit tota terra labium unum, et verba una. 	2.  Et 
fuit, cum proficiscerentur ii ab oriente, et invenerunt vallem in terra Shinar, et habitaverunt ibi. 	3.  Et dixerunt vir ad socium suum, Age, laterificemus lateres, et aduramus in adustum; et fuit 
iis later pro lapide, et bitumen fuit iis pro luto. 	4.  Et dixerunt, Age, aedificemus nobis urbem et turrim, et caput ejus in caelo; et faciamus nobis nomen, ne forte dispergamur super facies totius 
terrae. 	5.  Et descendit JEHOVAH ad videndum urbem et turrim, quam aedificabant filii hominis. 	6.  Et dixit JEHOVAH, En populus unus, et labium unum omnibus illis, et hoc inceptum eorum ad faciendum; 
et nunc non prohiberetur ab iis omne quod cogitarunt facere. 	7.  Age, descendamus, et confundamus ibi labium eorum, ut non audiant vir labium socii sui. 	8.  Et dispersit JEHOVAH eos inde super 
facies totius terrae; et cessarunt aedificare urbem. 	9.  Propterea vocavit nomen ejus Babel, quia ibi confudit JEHOVAH labium totius terrae; et inde dispersit eos JEHOVAH super facies totius terrae. 	10. 
 Hae nativitates Shemi; Shem filius centum annorum, et genuit Arpachshad, duobus annis post diluvium. 	11.  Et vixit Shem, postquam genuit illum Arpachshad, quingentis annis; et genuit filios 
et filias. 	12.  Et Arpachshad vixit quinque et triginta annis, et genuit Shelahum. 	13.  Et vixit Arpachshad, postquam genuit illum Shelahum, tribus annis et quadringentis annis; et genuit filios 
et filias. 	14. Et Shelah vixit triginta annis, et genuit Eberum. 	15.  Et vixit Shelah, postquam genuit illum Eberum, tribus annis et quadringentis annis; et genuit filios et filias. 	16.  Et vixit 
Eberus quatuor et triginta annis, et genuit Pelegum.  	17.  Et vixit Eberus, postquam genuit illum Pelegum, triginta annis et quadringentis annis; et genuit filios et filias. 	18.  Et vixit Peleg 
triginta annis, et genuit Reu. 	19.  Et vixit Peleg, postquam genuit illum Reu, novem annis et ducentis annis; et genuit filios et filias. 	20.  Et vixit Reu duobus et triginta annis, et genuit Serugum. 	21. 
 Et vixit Reu, postquam genuit illum Serugum, septem annis et ducentis annis; et genuit filios et filias. 	22.  Et vixit Serug triginta annis, et genuit Nahorem. 	23.  Et vixit Serug, 
postquam genuit illum Nahorem, ducentis annis; et genuit filios et filias. 	24.  Et vixit Nahor novem et viginti annis, et genuit Terahum. 	25.  Et vixit Nahor, postquam genuit illum Terahum, novendecim 
annis et centum annis; et genuit filios et filias. 	26.  Et vixit Terah septuaginta annis, et genuit Abramum, Nahorem et Haranem. 	27.  Et hae nativitates Terahi; Terah genuit Abramum, Nahorem, 
et Haranem; et Haran genuit Lotum. 	28.  Et mortuus est Haran super facies Terahi, patris sui, in terra nativitatis suae, in Ur Chaldaeorum. 	29.  Et accepit Abram et Nahor sibi uxores; nomen uxoris 
Abrami Sarai, et nomen uxoris Nahoris Milkah, filia Haranis, patris Milkae, et patris Jiskae. 	30.  Et fuit Sarai sterilis, nulla ei proles. 	31.  Et accepit Terah Abramum, filium suum, et Lotum filium 
Haranis, filium filii sui, et Sarai nurum suam, uxorem Abrami filii sui; et exiverunt cum illis ex Ur Chaldaeorum, ad eundum in terram Canaan; et venerunt usque ad Haran, et manserunt ibi. 	32. 
 Et fuerunt dies Terahi, quinque anni et ducenti anni; et mortuus est Terah in Haran. </p>
