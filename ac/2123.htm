<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2123节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2123.</strong>末世即将来临。这也可从以下来世的事实看出来：从主经由天堂流入灵人界的一切良善在灵人界立刻被转变为邪恶、淫秽和亵渎之物，一切真理立刻被转变为虚假。因此，相爱被转变为仇恨，诚实被转变为欺骗，诸如此类。结果，他们再也不能接受任何良善与真理。同样的情形也报应在人身上，因为他通过灵人被管理，与那些在灵人界的灵人相联。我通过大量经历十分清楚这一点，若将它全部讲述出来，必占用大量篇幅。我经常蒙允许觉察并倾听从天上来的善与真如何被转变为恶与假，以及转变的程度和性质。</p>

That the last time is at hand may also be seen from this fact in the other life, that all the good which flows in from the Lord through heaven into the world of spirits, is there turned in a moment into 
what is evil, obscene, and profane, and that all the truth is turned in a moment into falsity; thus mutual love is turned into hatred, sincerity into deceit, and so on; so that those who are there 
are no longer capable of perceiving anything of what is good and true; and the like redounds upon man, who is governed through spirits with whom those who are in the world of spirits have communication. 
The certainty of this I have learned by much experience, which, if all advanced, would fill many pages. I have very frequently been permitted to perceive and hear how what is good and true from heaven 
is turned into what is evil and false, together with the amount and the nature of the change. </p>

The imminence of this final period is also made clear in the next life by the fact that all good flowing in from the Lord by way of heaven into the world of spirits is in that world instantly converted 
into what is evil, disgusting, and profane, and all truth instantly converted into falsity. Thus mutual love is converted into hatred, honesty into deceit, and so on. As a result they are no longer 
capable of receiving anything good and true. The same situation is spilling over on to man, who is governed by means of spirits with whom those in the world of spirits are in communication. This I have 
been made fully aware of from much experience, which, if I were to relate it all, would fill many pages. I have been allowed very often to perceive and to hear how good and truth coming from heaven 
have been converted into evil and falsity, and also the extent and nature of this conversion. </p>

Quod ultimum tempus instet, etiam inde in altera vita constare potest quod omne bonum quod a Domino per caelum influit in mundum spirituum, momento ibi vertatur in malum, obscenum et profanum, et quod 
omne verum momento in falsum; ita amor mutuus in odium, sincerum in dolosum, et sic porro; ita ut non amplius receptibiles {1} sint alicujus boni et veri simile redundat in hominem qui regitur per 
spiritus, cum quibus communicationem habent illi qui ibi: hoc multa experientia mihi notissimum factum est, quam omnem si afferrem, multas paginas impleret; datum persaepe appercipere et audire bonum 
et verum quod e caelo, quomodo versum in malum et falsum, tum in quantum et in quale. 	@1 perceptibiles I.$ </p>
