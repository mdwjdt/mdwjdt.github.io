<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5028节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5028.</strong>“他就把衣裳丢在我这里”表证据。这从“把他的衣裳丢在她那里”的含义清楚可知，也就是说，“把他的衣裳丢在她那里”是一个证据，证明它曾靠近过（<a href="5019.htm">5019</a>节）。“衣裳”在内义上表示真理，“丢下衣裳”表示夺走最外层的真理（<a href="5008.htm">5008</a>节）。它在此之所以表示证据或见证，证明它曾靠近过，是因为最外层的真理当被丢弃或夺走时，就为属世人提供了反对属灵人的证据。属世人似乎通过最外层的真理与属灵人结合，而实际上并未结合（参看<a href="5009.htm">5009</a>节）；原因在于，当属灵人解释这真理时，这二者之间缺乏任何相似性就变得显而易见了。<br />前面（<a href="5008.htm">5008</a>节）所引证的例子有助于说明这一点。<br />属灵人和属世人一样，也会说要向穷人、寡妇、孤儿行善；但属灵人却认为不可向邪恶，或自称贫穷，其实却很富有的穷人、寡妇或孤儿行善；因为在这种情况下，他们就被这些纯粹的名称迷惑了。属灵人由此得出以下结论：在圣言中，“穷人”、“寡妇”和“孤儿”表示那些灵性上如此的人。但属世人却认为要向字面上所称呼的穷人、寡妇和孤儿行善；圣言所指的就是这些人，而非其他人；他也不关心他们是恶的，还是善的，不知道，也不想知道何为属灵层面的穷人、寡妇和孤儿。由此明显可知，这最外层的真理，即要向穷人、寡妇、孤儿行善，对属灵人和属世人来说，看似一样；但当加以解释时，这种相似性便不存在了。当缺乏任何相似性，这二者由此彼此分离时，最外层的真理作为证明属灵人曾靠近过的证据或见证而服务于属世人。因此，属世人会说谎反对不再拥有任何用来保护自己的事物的属灵人。所以，这个例子也有助于说明“衣裳”为何并以哪种方式表示证据或见证。<br />再举一例。属灵人也像属世人那样说，要向邻舍行善，又说每个人都是邻舍；然而，他却认为一个人成为邻舍的那个方面和程度不同于另一个人的；因恶人自称邻舍而向恶人行善，便是向邻舍行恶。在认同最外层的真理，即要向邻舍行善，以及每个人都是邻舍等真理方面，属世人与属灵人相结合。但属世人认为凡支持他的，就是邻舍，却不关心他是善的，还是恶的。由此也明显可知，就这个最外层的真理而言，这二者表面上结合在一起；然而，真正的结合并不存在；一解释这个真理，他们就会彼此分离。一旦他们分离，最外层的真理作为反对属灵人的证据，证明属灵人一直在拿它开玩笑而服务于属世人。其它例子（<a href="5008.htm">5008</a>节）也一样。</p>

That he left his garment by me. That this signifies testification, is evident from the signification of "leaving his garment by her," that is to say, as a witness that it made an approach (n. 5019). 
A "garment" in the internal sense signifies truth, and "leaving the garment," taking away ultimate truth (n. 5008). That it here signifies a witness or testification that it made an approach, is because 
ultimate truth, when it is left or taken away, is a witness to the natural man against the spiritual. That the natural man is as it were conjoined with the spiritual man by ultimate truth, but still 
is not conjoined, may be seen above (n. 5009); for when the spiritual man unfolds this truth, the dissimilarity becomes apparent. [2] The examples adduced above (n. 5008), may serve for illustration. 
The spiritual man as well as the natural says that aid should be given to the poor, to widows, and to orphans; but the spiritual man thinks that aid should not be given to the poor, to widows, and 
to orphans who are evil, and who call themselves needy and yet are rich, for in this way they would deceive by mere names; and so he concludes that by the "poor," the "widows," and the "orphans" in the 
Word, are meant those who are spiritually so. But the natural man thinks that aid should be given to the poor, widows, and orphans who are so called, and that these and no others are meant in the Word; 
neither does he care whether they are evil or good, not knowing nor wishing to know what it is to be so spiritually. It is plain from this that the ultimate truth, that aid should be given to the 
poor, widows, and orphans, appears similar to both; but when unfolded, it is dissimilar; and when it becomes dissimilar and causes disjunction, it serves the natural man as a witness or testification 
that the spiritual man had made an approach; hence he speaks what is false against the spiritual man, who no longer has anything by which to defend himself. So it is clear whence and in what respect a 
"garment" signifies also a witness or testification.  [3] Let us take also this example. The spiritual man as well as the natural man says that aid should be given to the neighbor, and he also says 
that everyone is the neighbor; but he thinks that one person is the neighbor in a different respect and degree than another, and that to give aid to an evil person because he calls himself neighbor, is 
to do harm to the neighbor. The natural man conjoins himself with the spiritual in the ultimate truth that aid should be given to the neighbor, and also in this, that every man is the neighbor; but 
he thinks that he who favors him is the neighbor, not caring whether he is good or evil. From this too it is plain that in this ultimate truth they are apparently conjoined, but that nevertheless there 
is no conjunction; and that as soon as the matter is explained, there is disjunction. And then this ultimate truth serves the natural man as a witness against the spiritual man for as it were mocking 
at him. So in all other cases. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5028</b></p><p><b>5028.</b>
That he left his garment with me' means proof. This is clear from the meaning of 'leaving his garment with her' as evidence that an approach had been made, dealt with in <a href="5019.htm">5019</a>. 'A garment' in the internal 
sense means truth, and 'leaving a garment' means removing outermost truth, <a href="5008.htm">5008</a>. The reason why evidence or proof that an approach had been made is meant here is that when outermost truth is left 
behind or removed it supplies to the natural man evidence against the spiritual man. For it seems as though the spiritual man is joined to the natural man by means of outermost truth, but it is not in 
fact so joined, see <a href="5008.htm">5008</a> - the reason being that when the spiritual man explains that truth the lack of any similarity between the two becomes apparent. But let the examples introduced previously in <a href="5008.htm">5008</a> serve to illustrate this. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The spiritual man says, just as the natural man does, that good should be done to the poor, widows, and orphans; but the spiritual man thinks that good should not 
be done to the poor, widows, or orphans who are evil, or who call themselves poor when in fact they are rich; for then they would mislead simply by the words they use. From this the spiritual man is 
led to deduce that the poor, widows, and orphans mentioned in the Word mean those who are spiritually so. But the natural man thinks that good should be done to the poor, widows, and orphans who are 
literally called such, and that none other than these are meant in the Word; nor is he interested in whether they are evil or good people. What the poor, widows, and orphans may be on a spiritual level 
he neither knows nor wishes to know. From this one may see that this outermost truth - that good should be done to the poor, widows, and orphans - appears to be the same with both the spiritual man 
and the natural man; but when it is explained no such similarity exists. But when the lack of any similarity comes out, the two are consequently parted from each other, and then outermost truth serves 
the natural man as evidence or proof that an approach has been made. Therefore it speaks falsely against the spiritual man who no longer has anything with which to protect himself. Accordingly this example 
too serves to show why and in what way 'a garment' means evidence or proof.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Take another example. The spiritual man says, just as the natural man does, that good should be done to the neighbour. 
He also says that everyone is his neighbour, yet he thinks that one person is his neighbour in a different respect and degree from another, and that to do good to an evil person because he calls 
himself his neighbour is to do evil to the neighbour. The natural man joins the spiritual man in subscribing to that outermost truth - the truth that good should be done to the neighbour, and also 
the truth that everyone is the neighbour. But he supposes that the neighbour is anyone who is favourably disposed towards him; and he has no interest in whether that person is good or evil. This example 
too shows that the two appear to be joined together so far as outermost truth is concerned, but that there is no real joining together, also that as soon as that truth is explained they become parted 
from each other. Once they are parted outermost truth serves the natural man as evidence against the spiritual man that the latter has been making sport of it so to speak. The same can be seen in 
all the other examples [in <a href="5008.htm">5008</a>]. </p>

`Et reliquit vestem suam apud me': quod significet testificationem, constat (c)a significatione `relinquere vestem suam apud se' quod sit testis quod accesserit, de qua {1} n. 5019; </p>
<p>`vestis' in sensu 
interno significat verum, et `relinquere vestem' abstrahere verum ultimum, n. 5008; quod hic significet testem seu testificationem quod accesserit, est quia velim ultimum cum relinquitur seu abstrahitur 
testis est naturali homini contra spiritualem; quod spiritualis homo cum naturali homine quasi conjungatur per verum ultimum, at quod usque non conjungatur {2}, videatur n. (x)5008; cum 
enim spiritualis homo explicat illud verum, tunc apparet dissimilitudo; (o)sed illustrationi sint exempla, quae prius n. 5008 allata sunt: [2] spiritualis homo aeque ac naturalis dicit quod pauperibus, 
viduis (o)et pupillis benefaciendum, sed (t)spiritualis homo cogitat quod non benefaciendum pauperibus, viduis (o)et pupillis qui mali sunt, et qui se vocant tales et usque divites sunt, sic enim 
per sola nomina deciperent; et inde concludit quod per pauperes, viduas (o)et pupillos in Verbo intelligantur qui spiritualiter tales sunt; </p>
<p>naturalis vero homo cogitat quod benefaciendum pauperibus, 
viduis et pupillis qui ita nominantur, et quod illi non alii intelligantur in Verbo, et num mali sint vel boni, non curat; quid spiritualiter talis esse, non scit nec scire vult; inde patet quod 
ultimum verum, nempe quod benefaciendum pauperibus, viduis et pupillis, utrique appareat simile, sed cum explicatur quod sit dissimile; et cum fit dissimile et inde disjunctio, inservit id naturali 
homini pro teste seu testificatione quod accesserit, inde falsum loquitur contra spiritualem hominem, qui non amplius quid habet per quod se defendat; liquet sic unde et in quo respectu `vestis' 
etiam significat {3} testem seu testificationem.  [3] Sit quoque exemplum: spiritualis homo aeque ac naturalis homo dicit quod proximo benefaciendum, et quoque dicit quod omnis homo sit proximus sed 
cogitat quod unus in alio respectu et gradu proximus sit quam alter, et quod benefacere malo quia se vocat proximum, sit malefacere proximo; naturalis homo se conjungit cum spirituali in ultimo 
illo vero quod nempe benefaciendum proximo, et quoque in illo quod omnis homo sit proximus, sed cogitat quod ille proximus sit qui ei favet, non curans sive bonus sit sive malus; inde quoque patet 
quod in ultimo vero apparenter conjungantur, sed usque quod nulla conjunctio sit et {4}, ut primum explicatur, {5} sit disjunctio; inservit tunc ultimum illud verum naturali homini pro teste contra 
spiritualem quod sicut illuserit.  Similiter in omnibus reliquis. @1 i supra$ @2 i sed appareat naturali homini quasi conjungatur$ @3 significet$ @4 at$ @5 i quod$ </p>
