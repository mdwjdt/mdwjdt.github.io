<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9227.</strong>“第八天你要把它归给我”表在下一个状态的初始阶段，就是他们过着一种良善生活之时，他们与主同住。这从“第八天”和“归给耶和华”的含义清楚可知：“第八天”是指下一个状态的初始阶段（参看<a href="2044.htm">2044</a>，<a href="8400.htm">8400</a>e节）；“归给耶和华”是指归给主，因为在圣言中，“耶和华”表示主（<a href="1736.htm">1736</a>，<a href="2921.htm">2921</a>，<a href="3023.htm">3023</a>，<a href="3035.htm">3035</a>，<a href="5663.htm">5663</a>，<a href="6303.htm">6303</a>，<a href="6945.htm">6945</a>，<a href="6956.htm">6956</a>，<a href="8274.htm">8274</a>，<a href="8864.htm">8864</a>节）。这句话之所以表示当一个人过着一种良善生活时，他就与主同住，是因为在内义上论述的一个正在重生的人所经历的两种状态。第一种状态是当他正通过信之真理被引向仁之良善时；第二种是当他进入这良善时。由于这时此人与主同住，所以“你要把它归给我”表示这些事。人在重生期间有两种状态，第一种就是当他正通过信之真理被引向仁之良善时，第二种是当他进入仁之良善时（参看<a href="7923.htm">7923</a>，<a href="7992.htm">7992</a>，<a href="8505.htm">8505</a>-<a href="8506.htm">8506</a>，<a href="8510.htm">8510</a>，<a href="8512.htm">8512</a>，<a href="8516.htm">8516</a>，<a href="8643.htm">8643</a>，<a href="8648.htm">8648</a>，<a href="8658.htm">8658</a>，<a href="8685.htm">8685</a>，<a href="8690.htm">8690</a>，<a href="8701.htm">8701</a>节）；当一个人进入仁之良善时，他就在天堂，因而与主同住（<a href="8516.htm">8516</a>，<a href="8539.htm">8539</a>，<a href="8722.htm">8722</a>，<a href="8772.htm">8772</a>，<a href="9139.htm">9139</a>节）。<br />有必要用几句话说一说一个正在重生的人所经历的这两种状态是何性质。前面（<a href="9224.htm">9224</a>节）已说明，被称为信之真理的真理通过外在途径进入人，系仁之良善的良善则通过内在途径进入。外在途径在于通过听觉进入记忆，从记忆进入理解力；因为理解力是人的内视。必属于信的真理通过外在途径进入，是为了使它们可以被引入意愿，从而变成人自己的。通过内在途径从主流入的良善流入意愿，因为意愿是人的内在。来自主的良善在共同边界处，或意愿的外围，与通过外在途径进入的真理相遇，并通过与它们结合而使真理转化为良善。这一切发生到何等程度，秩序就在何等程度上被翻转过来，也就是说，此人就在何等程度上不被真理，而是被良善引导，因而在何等程度上被主引导。<br />由此可见，一个人在重生期间，是如何从世界被提升到天堂的。因为通过听觉进入的一切都从世界进入的；被存在记忆中，然后从记忆而来，并呈现给理解力的事物出现在被称为属世之光的世界之光中。而进入意愿，或属于意愿的事物在天堂之光中，天堂之光就是来自主的良善之真理。当这些事物从意愿出来进入行为时，它们就回到世界之光中；但此时它们以完全不同的形式出现在这光中。因为之前世界存在于这些事物的每一个里面，但后来天堂存在于每一个里面。这些考虑也表明为何一个人在出于意愿真理，因而出于对它们的仁爱和情感而行真理之前，不在天堂。</p>

On the eighth day thou shalt give it to Me. That this signifies that at the beginning of the following state, when the man lives from good, he is with the Lord, is evident from the signification of "the 
eighth day," as being the beginning of the following state (see n. 2044, 8400); and from the signification of "giving to Jehovah," as being to the Lord, for by "Jehovah" in the Word is meant the Lord 
(n. 1736, 2921, 3023, 3035, 5663, 6303, 6945, 6956, 8274, 8864). The reason why these words signify that when a man lives from good he is with the Lord, is that in the internal sense the subject treated 
of is the two states of the man who is being regenerated; and the first state is when he is being led through the truths of faith to the good of charity; and the second is when he is in this good. 
And as he is then with the Lord, this is signified by "thou shalt give it to Me." (That there are two states with man when being regenerated; the first when he is being led through the truths of faith 
to the good of charity, and the second when he is in the good of charity, see n. 7923, 7992, 8505-8506, 8510, 8512, 8516, 8643, 8648, 8658, 8685, 8690, 8701; and that the man is in heaven, thus with 
the Lord, when he is in the good of charity, n. 8516, 8539, 8722, 8772, 9139.) [2] A few words more shall be said about these two states with the man who is being regenerated. It has been already 
shown (n. 9224) that the truths called the truths of faith enter into man by an external way, and that the good which is of charity and love enters by an internal way. The external way is through the 
hearing into the memory, and from the memory into the understanding; for the understanding is man's internal sight. The truths which must be of faith enter by this way, to the end that they may be brought 
into the will, and thus be appropriated to the man. The good which flows in from the Lord by the internal way, flows into the will, for the will is the internal of man. The good which is from the 
Lord meets there at the common boundary the truths which have entered by the external way, and through conjunction with them causes the truths to become good. Insofar as this is effected, so far the 
order is inverted, that is, so far the man is not led by truths, but by good; and consequently insofar he is led by the Lord. [3] From this it can be seen how during his regeneration a man is raised 
from the world into heaven. For all things that enter through the hearing, enter from the world; and those which are stored up in the memory, and appear there before the understanding, appear in the 
light of the world, which is called natural light. But those things which enter the will, or which become of the will, are in the light of heaven, which light is the truth of good from the Lord. When 
these things come forth from the will into act, they return into the light of the world; but they then appear in this light under a totally different form; for previously the world was within everything; 
whereas afterward heaven is so. What has here been said shows also why a man is not in heaven until he does truths from willing them, thus from the affection of charity. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9227</b></p><p><b>9227.</b>
'On the eighth day you shall give it to Me' means that in the initial phase of the following state when they lead a life of good they dwell with the Lord. This is clear from the meaning of 'the eighth 
day' as the initial phase of the following state, dealt with in <a href="2044.htm">2044</a>, <a href="8400.htm">8400</a> (end); and from the meaning of 'giving to Jehovah' as giving to the Lord since 'Jehovah' is used in the Word to mean the Lord, <a href="1736.htm">1736</a>, <a href="2921.htm">2921</a>, <a href="3023.htm">3023</a>, <a href="3035.htm">3035</a>, <a href="5663.htm">5663</a>, <a href="6303.htm">6303</a>, <a href="6945.htm">6945</a>, <a href="6956.htm">6956</a>, <a href="8274.htm">8274</a>, <a href="8864.htm">8864</a>. The reason why when they lead a life of good they dwell with the Lord is meant is that the internal sense deals with both states experienced 
by a person who is being regenerated. The first state is when the person is led by means of the truths of faith towards the good of charity, and the second state is when he has come into that good. 
Since the person then dwells with the Lord, these things are therefore meant by 'you shall give it to Me'.  </p>
<p>A person has two states while being regenerated, the first when he is led by means of 
the truths of faith towards the good of charity, and the second when he has come into the good of charity, see <a href="7923.htm">7923</a>, <a href="7992.htm">7992</a>, <a href="8505.htm">8505</a>, <a href="8506.htm">8506</a>, <a href="8510.htm">8510</a>, <a href="8512.htm">8512</a>, <a href="8516.htm">8516</a>, <a href="8643.htm">8643</a>, <a href="8648.htm">8648</a>, <a href="8658.htm">8658</a>, <a href="8685.htm">8685</a>, <a href="8690.htm">8690</a>, <a href="8701.htm">8701</a>.  A person 
is in heaven and so dwells with the Lord when he has come into the good of charity, <a href="8516.htm">8516</a>, <a href="8539.htm">8539</a>, <a href="8722.htm">8722</a>, <a href="8772.htm">8772</a>, <a href="9139.htm">9139</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Something more must be stated briefly concerning the nature of these two states 
with a person who is being regenerated. It has been shown already in <a href="9224.htm">9224</a> that truths which are called matters of faith enter by the external route with a person, and that good which is the good of 
charity and love enters by the internal route. The external route lies through hearing into the memory, and from the memory into the person's understanding, the understanding being a person's inward sight. 
The truths which are to become matters of faith enter by the external route to the end that they may be introduced into the will and so be made the person's own. The good which flows in from the 
Lord by the internal route flows into the will, for the will is the person's inward self. The good coming from the Lord meets, in the outer reaches of the will, the truths that have entered by the external 
route, and by joining itself to them causes the truths to be converted into good. And to the extent that this takes place order is turned around, that is, the person is not led by truths but by 
good, consequently is led by the Lord.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From all this one may see the way in which a person is raised from the world to heaven when being regenerated. For everything that enters through hearing 
enters in from the world; and the things that have been deposited in the memory, then come from the memory and present themselves to the understanding, are seen in the light of the world, which is called 
natural illumination. But the things which enter the will or come to belong to the will are in the light of heaven, the light of heaven being the truth of good from the Lord. When these things go 
out of the will into actions they go back into the light of the world; but they now take on in this light a completely different appearance. For initially the world was present within each one of those 
things, but afterwards heaven is present within each one. These considerations also show why a person is not in heaven until he does truths because he wills them, and so because he has charity and 
affection for them.  </p>

`Die octavo dabis illud Mihi': quod significet principium status sequentis cum ex bono vivitur, quod tunc apud Dominum, constat ex significatione `diei octavi' quod sit principium status sequentis, 
de qua n. 2044, 8400 fin., et ex significatione `dare Jehovae' quod sit Domino, nam per `Jehovam' in Verbo intelligitur Dominus, n. 1736, 2921, 3023, 3035, 5663, 6303, 6945, 6956, 8274, 8864; quod sit 
cum ex bono vivitur quod tunc apud Dominum, est quia in sensu interno agitur de bino statu hominis qui regeneratur, et primus status est cum ducitur per vera fidei ad bonum charitatis, et secundus status 
est cum in bono illo est; quia tunc est apud Dominum, ideo haec per {1}'dabis illud Mihi' significantur; {2}quod bini status sint homini cum regeneratur, primus cum ducitur per vera fidei ad bona 
charitatis, et secundus cum in bono charitatis est, videatur n. 7923, 7992, 8505, 8506, 8510, 8512, 8516, 8643, 8648, 8658, 8685, 8690, 8701, et quod homo in caelo {3}sit, ita apud Dominum, cum in bono 
charitatis est, n. 8516, 8539, 8722, 8772, 9139. 2 Paucis adhuc dicetur quomodo se habet cum bino illo statu apud hominem qui regeneratur: prius n. (x)9224 ostensum est quod vera quae fidei vocantur, 
per viam externam apud hominem intrent, et quod bonum quod charitatis et amoris, per viam internam; via externa est per auditum in memoriam, et a memoria in ejus intellectum, {4} intellectus (d)enim 
est visus hominis internus; per hanc viam intrant vera quae fidei erunt ob finem ut introducantur in voluntatem et sic approprientur homini; bonum quod {5}a Domino influit per viam internam, influit 
in voluntatem, nam voluntas est internum hominis; {6}bonum quod a Domino in confinio ibi occurrit veris quae intraverunt per viam externam, et per conjunctionem, facit ut vera fiant bonum; et quantum 
hoc fit tantum invertitur ordo, hoc est, tantum non ducitur homo per vera sed per bonum; proinde tantum ducitur a Domino. 3 Ex his constare potest quomodo homo e mundo elevatur in caelum quando regeneratur; 
omnia enim quae per auditum intrant e mundo intrant; et quae in memoria reposita sunt, et {7}ex memoria apparent coram intellectu, in luce mundi, quae lumen naturale vocatur, apparent; at quae

prorsus sub alia forma apparent; prius enim in singulis fuit mundus intus, postea autem in singulis est caelum intus.  Ex his quoque patet cur homo non prius in caelo sit quam cum facit vera ex velle
