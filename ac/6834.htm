<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6834节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6834.</strong>“荆棘却没有烧毁”表属世层中联结于神性良善的神性真理。这从“荆棘”和“没有被火烧毁”的含义清楚可知：“荆棘”是指真正的记忆知识，或记忆知识的真理，如前所述（<a href="6832.htm">6832</a>，<a href="6833.htm">6833</a>节），在此因论及主，故表示属世层中的神性真理（之所以是指属世层，是因为真理在那里以记忆知识的形式出现）；“没有被火烧毁”是指没有被神性之爱的良善消散或化为乌有，“火”是指神性之爱的良善（参看<a href="6832.htm">6832</a>节）。因此，它被联结于它，即在属世层中神性真理被联结于神性良善。这就是这些话在论述主的至高意义上的含义。此中情形是这样：在来世，神性之爱的神性良善是真正的太阳之火。这火如此炽热，以致如果它的热真的落到某个人身上，哪怕落到至内层天堂的一位天使身上，中间没有一个缓和的防护物，那么他会丧失所有意识感觉，从而被毁灭。主的神性之爱就是如此炽热。但当主在世，并将人身本质与神性本质联结起来时，祂在自己的人身里面接受这爱之火，并将它与当祂将祂自己变成神之律法时的真理相联结。这就是属世层中神性真理被联结神性良善的意思。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6834</b></p><p><b>6834.</b>
And the bramble was in no wise consumed. That this signifies Divine truth united to Divine good in the natural, is evident from the signification of a "bramble," as being the truth of memory-knowledge 
(of which above, n. 6832, 6833); here being said of the Lord, it denotes Divine truth in the natural, and the natural is signified because the truth of memory-knowledge is there; and from the signification 
of "not being consumed by fire," as being not to be dissipated by the good of Divine love (that "fire" is the good of Divine love, see just above, n. 6832), thus that it is united, namely, Divine 
truth with Divine good in the natural. This is the signification of these words in the supreme sense, in which the Lord is treated of. The case herein is this. The Divine good of the Divine love is 
the very solar fire in the other life, which fire is so ardent that if it were to light on anyone without an intermediate tempering, even on an angel of the inmost heaven, he would be deprived of all 
sense, and would perish. Such is the ardor of the Lord's Divine love. But when the Lord was in the world, and united the human essence to the Divine essence, He received the fire of this love in His 
Human, and united it to the truth there when He made Himself the law Divine. This then is what is meant by the Divine truth being united to the Divine good in the natural. </p>

'And the bramble bush was not at all being consumed' means Divine Truth united to Divine Good in the natural. This is clear from the meaning of 'the bramble bush' as true factual knowledge, dealt with 
above in <a href="6831.htm">6831</a>, <a href="6833.htm">6833</a>, but in this instance as Divine Truth in the natural, since the description has reference to the Lord (the natural is meant because there truth takes the form of factual knowledge); 
and from the meaning of 'not being consumed by the fire' as not being reduced to nothing by the good of Divine Love, 'fire' being the good of Divine Love, see just above in <a href="6832.htm">6832</a> Thus the fact that 
it was united to it, that is to say, Divine Truth was united to Divine Good in the natural, is what is meant by the words used here. It is their meaning in the highest sense, in which the Lord is the 
subject. The implications of this are as follows: The Divine Good of Divine Love is the actual fire of the sun in the next life. That fire is so hot that if its heat were to fall on someone, even on 
an angel of the inmost heaven, without a shield to moderate it, he would be deprived of all conscious feeling and would be destroyed. This is how hot God's love is in the Lord. But when the Lord was in 
the world and united the Human Essence to the Divine Essence, He received in His Human the fire of that love and there united it to truth when He made Himself the law of God. This then is what one should 
understand by the statement that Divine Truth was united to Divine Good within the natural. </p>

`Et rubus nullatenus consumebatur':  quod significet Divinum Verum unitum Divino Bono in naturali, constat ex significatione `rubi' quod sit verum scientificum, de qua supra n. 6832, 6833, hic quia 
de Domino {1}, est Divinum Verum in naturali; naturale significatur quia ibi est {2}verum scientifice; et ex significatione `non consumi igne' quod sit non dissipari a bono {3}Divini Amoris; quod `ignis' 
sit bonum {4}Divini Amoris, videatur mox supra n. 6832, ita quod {5}unitum sit, nempe Divinum Verum cum Divino Bono in naturali; haec significatio horum verborum {6}est in sensu supremo, in quo agitur 
de Domino.  Cum hoc ita se habet: Divinum Bonum Divini {7}Amoris est ipse ignis solaris in altera vita, qui ignis talis ardoris est ut si absque intermedia temperatura incideret in aliquem, etiam 
si in angelum intimi caeli, orbaretur is omni sensu ac periret; tali ardore est amor Divinus Domini; Dominus autem, cum fuit in mundo ac univit Essentiam Humanam Divinae, hujus amoris ignem in Humano 
Suo recepit, ac univit vero ibi cum Se fecit legem Divinam; hoc nunc est quod intelligitur per quod Divinum Verum unitum sit Divino Bono in naturali. 	@1 i est$ 	@2 scientificum, omnia enim scientifica 
sunt mentis naturalis$ 	@3 amoris Divini$ 	@4 amoris Divini$ 	@5 unita sint$ 	@6 Before horum$ 	@7 amoris$ </p>
