<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1877节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1877.</strong>在灵人界的灵魂或灵人，尤其恶灵，一开始会保持他们活在肉身时所具有的事物，也就是尘世、肉体和世俗之物，以及他们先入为主的定见。那些不想听到有关圣言内义的任何事物，只想听字义之人就在这些灵人之列。他们甚至以为十二使徒将坐在十二个宝座上审判以色列的十二个支派，还以为除了穷人、不幸者和受到迫害的人外，没人能进入天堂。而事实上，凡过着仁爱的生活并信主的有钱、有权之人都在天堂有一席之地。由于这类灵人因自己的功德而声称天堂是他们的，所以我看到他们四处奔走，无论到哪里，都取笑属于圣言内义的事物，因为这些事物违背他们的信念和欲望。他们渴望配上天堂，并凌驾于其他所有人之上。但他们就象流入血液、充满静脉和动脉、污染绝大部分血液的败坏和有害之物。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1877.</strong> At first, people who are souls or spirits in the world of spirits (especially the bad ones) hold on to what they had during their physical life: earthly, bodily, and worldly concerns, and along with them, any principles they had adopted. Such people include those who are unwilling to hear anything about the Word's inner sense but only about the literal meaning. They even believe that the twelve apostles will sit on twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel. Again, they believe that the only people who can go to heaven are those who are poor, unhappy, and persecuted.{*1} The truth is that both the rich and the powerful go there, if they have lived a life of charity and faith in the Lord.<br />Since people like this demand heaven as their just reward, they run around making fun of the message of the Word's inner meaning wherever they go, because it opposes their delusions and cravings. I saw them do so. What they want is to earn heaven and to be promoted above everybody else, but they resemble diseases and poisons that enter the bloodstream, spread through the veins and arteries, and pollute the whole supply of blood.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the judgment of the twelve tribes by the apostles, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1877/bible_king-james-version_matthew_19_28" target=_top>Matthew 19:28</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1877/bible_king-james-version_luke_22_30" target=_top>Luke 22:30</a>. The reference to the poor, unhappy, and persecuted is an allusion to the Beatitudes: "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted... . Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1877/bible_king-james-version_matthew_5_3" target=_top>Matthew 5:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1877/bible_king-james-version_matthew_5_4" target=_top>4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1877/bible_king-james-version_matthew_5_10" target=_top>10</a>; New Revised Standard Version).

The souls or spirits who are in the world of spirits, especially the wicked, retain at first the things which they had in their life of the body, that is, things earthly, corporeal, and worldly, and 
with them the principles which they had taken up. Among these spirits are those who are not willing to hear anything concerning the internal sense of the Word, but only concerning the literal sense, which 
they carry so far as to believe that the twelve apostles are to sit upon twelve thrones and to judge the twelve tribes of Israel; and also that none but the poor, the miserable, and they that have 
suffered persecutions can enter into heaven; when yet both the rich and the powerful who have lived in charity and in faith in the Lord are there. As such persons claim heaven for themselves on account 
of their merits, I have seen them running hither and thither, and wherever they went they derided the things which are of the internal sense of the Word, for the reason that these are contrary to 
their persuasions and cupidities, in that they desire to merit heaven and to be preferred before all others. But they are like the corrupt and noxious things that flow into the blood, and pervade the 
veins and arteries, and pollute the mass of the blood.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1877</b></p><p><b>1877.</b>
Those souls or spirits - especially evil ones - who are in the world of spirits retain to begin with the things which they had during their lifetime, that is, things that are earthly, bodily, and worldly, 
and together with these whatever assumptions they have adopted. Among these spirits are those who do not wish to hear anything about the internal sense of the Word, but only about the literal sense. 
Indeed they go so far as to believe that the twelve apostles are to sit on twelve thrones and to judge the twelve tribes of Israel. They believe too that none but the poor, the wretched, and those 
who have suffered persecution can enter heaven, when in fact both the wealthy and the powerful who have led lives of charity and faith in the Lord have their place in heaven. Since such spirits claim 
that heaven is theirs because they deserve it by their merits, I have seen them running this way and that, and whichever way they go they laugh scornfully at the things which belong to the internal 
sense of the Word, because these things are contrary to their persuasions and desires, in that they wish to merit heaven and to be placed above all others. But they are like the corrupt and harmful things 
which enter into the bloodstream, pass through the veins and arteries, and contaminate most of the blood. </p>

</p><b>1877.</b>
Qui in mundo spirituum sunt animae seu spiritus, imprimis mali retinent primum illa quae habuerant in vita corporis eorum, nempe terrestria corporea, et mundana, et cum illis principia quae captarunt; 
inter quos sunt illi qui nihil de sensu interno Verbi audire volant, sed solum de sensu litterali immo usque adeo ut credant quod duodecim apostoli sessuri sint super duodecim thronis et judicaturi 
duodecim tribus Israelis; pariter quod nulli intrare possint in caelum nisi pauperes, miseri et persecutiones passi; cum tamen ibi sint tam divites quam potentes, qui in charitate et fide in Dominum 
vixerunt; tales quia vindicant sibi caelum ex meritis, vidi quod discurrant, et ubicumque veniunt, subsannent illa quae sunt sensus interni Verbi, quia contra eorum persuasiones et cupiditates, quod mereri 
velint caelum et praeferri omnibus aliis; sed comparantur illi vitiosis et noxiis quae influunt in sanguinem, et pervadunt venas et arterias, ac massam sanguinis inquinant. </p>
