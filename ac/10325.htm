The books of the Word are all those which have an internal sense; and those which have not an internal sense are not the Word. The books of the Word in the Old Testament are the five books of Moses, 
the book of Joshua, the book of Judges, the two books of Samuel, the two books of Kings, the Psalms of David, the Prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, 
Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi; and in the New Testament the four Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John; and Revelation.            EXODUS 31 </p>
<p>     1. And 
Jehovah spoke unto Moses, saying,      2. See, I have called by name Bezalel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; </p>
<p>     3. And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, 
and in intelligence, and in knowledge, and in all work; </p>
<p>     4. To think thoughts, to make in gold, and in silver, and in brass; </p>
<p>     5. And in graving of stone for filling, and in carving of wood, 
to do in all work.      6. And I, behold I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of everyone that is wise in heart I have put wisdom; and they shall 
make all that I have commanded thee; </p>
<p>     7. The Tent of meeting, and the ark for the Testimony, and the propitiatory that is thereupon, and all the vessels of the Tent; </p>
<p>     8. And the table and 
its vessels, and the pure lampstand and all its vessels, and the altar of incense; </p>
<p>     9. And the altar of burnt-offering and all its vessels, and the laver and its base; </p>
<p>     10. And the garments 
of the ministry, and the garments of holiness for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office; </p>
<p>     11. And the oil of anointing, and the incense of spices for 
the holy; according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.      12. And Jehovah said unto Moses, saying,      13. And speak thou unto the sons of Israel, saying, But yet ye shall keep My 
Sabbaths; for it is a sign between Me and you to your generations, to know that I am Jehovah who maketh you holy.      14. And ye shall keep the Sabbath; for this is holy to you; he that profaneth it, 
dying he shall die; for everyone that doeth work on that day, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of his peoples.      15. Six days shall work be done; and on the seventh day is the Sabbath of 
the Sabbath, holy to Jehovah; everyone that doeth work on the Sabbath day, dying he shall die.      16. And the sons of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to perform the Sabbath to their generations, a 
covenant of an age.      17. This is a sign between Me and the sons of Israel to an age; for in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day He rested, and took breath.      18. And 
He gave unto Moses, in His completing to speak with him on Mount Sinai, the two tables of the Testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God. </p>

<p>CAPUT XXI 1.  Et locutus est Jehovah ad Moschen, dicendo, 2.  Vide vocavi nomine Bezaleelem filium Uri 
filii Churi tribui Jehudae. 3.  Et implevi illum Spiritu Dei, in sapientia, et in intelligentia, et in scientia, et in omni opere. 4.  Ad excogitandum excogitationes, ad faciendum in auro, et in argento, 
et in aere. 5.  Et in sculptura lapidis ad implendum, et in sculptura ligni ad faciendum in omni opere. 6.  Et Ego ecce dedi cum illo Aholiabum filium Achisamachi tribui Dan; et in corde omnis 
sapientis corde dedi sapientiam; et facient omnia quae praecepi tibi. 7.  Tentorium conventus, et arcam testimonio, et propitiatorium quod super illa, et omnia vasa tentorii. 8.  Et mensam et vasa 
ejus, et candelabrum purum et omnia vasa ejus, et altare suffimenti. 9.  Et altare holocausti et omnia vasa ejus, et labrum et basin ejus. 10.  Et vestes ministerii, et vestes sanctitatis Aharoni sacerdoti, 
et vestes filiorum ejus, ad fungendum sacerdotio. 11.  Et oleum unctionis, et suffimentum aromatum pro sancto; juxta omnia quae praecepi tibi, facient. 12.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, dicendo, 13. 
 Et tu loquere ad filios Israelis, dicendo, Verumtamen sabbata Mea custodietis, quia signum id inter Me et inter vos generationibus vestris, ad sciendum quod Ego Jehovah sanctificans vos. 14. 
 Et custodietis sabbatum, quia sanctum hoc vobis; profanans illud moriendo morietur; quia omnis faciens in illo opus, et exscindetur anima illa e medio populorum suorum. 15.  Sex diebus fiet opus, 
et in die septimo sabbatum sabbati, sanctum Jehovae; omnis faciens opus in die sabbati moriendo morietur. 16.  Et custodient filii Israelis sabbatum ad faciendum sabbatum generationibus illorum, foedus 
saeculi. 17.  Inter Me et inter filios Israelis signum hoc in saeculum; quia sex diebus fecit Jehovah caelum et terram, et in die septimo quievit et respiravit. 18.  Et dedit ad Moschen in absolvendo 
Ipso ad loquendum cum illo in monte Sinai, duas tabulas testimonii, tabulas lapidis, scriptas digito Dei. </p>
