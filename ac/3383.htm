<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3383节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3383.</strong>创世记26:6，7. 以撒就住在基拉耳，那地方的人问到他的妻子，他便说，她是我的妹子。原来他怕说：她是我的妻子；恐怕这地方的人为利百加的缘故杀我，因为她甚是好看。 <br />“以撒就住在基拉耳”表相对于要联结的理性事物，主在信之事物上的状态。“那地方的人问到他的妻子”表人们询问关于神圣真理的问题。“他便说，她是我的妹子”表理性真理。“原来他怕说：她是我的妻子；恐怕这地方的人为利百加的缘故杀我”表他不可能自己透露神圣真理，因为这样神圣良善就不会被接受。“因为她甚是好看”表它因被称为神性而有可能很容易被接受。</p>

Verses 6, 7. And Isaac dwelt in Gerar. And the men of the place asked him concerning his woman; and he said, She is my sister, because he feared to say, She is my woman; lest the men of the place should 
kill me for Rebekah; because she was good to look upon. "And Isaac dwelt in Gerar," signifies the Lord's state in regard to the things of faith relatively to the rational things that were to be adjoined; 
"and the men of the place asked him concerning his woman," signifies the investigations of men concerning Divine truth; "and he said, She is my sister," signifies rational truth; "because he feared 
to say, She is my woman; lest the men of the place should kill me for the sake of Rebekah," signifies that he could not open Divine truths themselves, for thus Divine good would not be received; 
"because she was good to look upon," signifies that it may easily be received from its being called Divine.  </p>

Verses 6, 7 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar. And the men of the place asked about his wife, and he said, She is my sister. For he was afraid to say, My wife, [thinking,] The men of the place may perhaps kill 
me on account of Rebekah; for she was good-looking. </p>
<p>'Isaac dwelt in Gerar' means the Lord's state as regards matters of faith in respect to rational concepts which were to be allied. 'And the men 
of the place asked about his wife' means questions that people ask about Divine Truth. 'And he said, She is my sister' means rational truth. 'For he was afraid to say, My wife, [thinking,] The men of 
the place may perhaps kill me on account of Rebekah' means that it was impossible for Divine Truths themselves to be disclosed, and so for Divine Good to be received. 'For she was good-looking' means 
that it could be received without difficulty because of its being called Divine. </p>

Vers. 6, 7.  Et habitabat Jishak in Gerar. Et interrogaverunt viri loci ad mulierem ejus; et dixit, Soror mea illa, quia timuit dicere, Mulier mea; forte occidant me viri loci propter Rebeccam, quia 
bona aspectu illa. `Habitabat Jishak in Gerar' significat statum Domini quoad illa quae sunt fidei respective ad rationalia quae adjungenda: `et interrogaverunt viri loci ad mulierem ejus' significat 
disquisitiones hominum de Divino Vero: `et dixit, Soror mea illa' significat verum rationale: `quia timuit dicere, Mulier mea; forte occidant me viri loci propter Rebeccam' significat quod non potuit 
aperire ipsa Divina Vera, sic Divinum Bonum non reciperetur: `quia bona aspectu illa' significat quod facile recipi posset ex eo quod Divinum dicatur. </p>
