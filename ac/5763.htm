<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5763节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5763.</strong>“在谁那里找着了，谁就作我的奴仆”表与这事物同在的人将永远没有自己的自由。这从“奴仆”的含义清楚可知，“奴仆”是指没有自己的自由，如前所述（<a href="5760.htm">5760</a>节）。情况是这样：按照约瑟的吩咐放在便雅悯那里的约瑟的银杯表示内层真理（参看<a href="5736.htm">5736</a>，<a href="5747.htm">5747</a>节）。凡拥有内层真理都知道，一切真理与良善皆来自主；还知道人自己或源于人自己的一切自由都是地狱的自由。因为当一个人凭自己的自由思考或行事时，他所思所行的，无非是邪恶。因此，他是魔鬼的奴仆，因为一切邪恶都是从地狱流入的。他在这种自由中也感觉到快乐，因为它迎合他所沉浸并生于其中的邪恶。因此，他必须脱去他自己的自由，披上天堂的自由以取而代之；天堂的自由就在于意愿良善，因而践行良善，在于渴慕真理，因而思考真理。当一个人获得这种自由时，他就是主的奴仆或仆人，在这种情况下便享有真自由，不是在以前所在、看似自由的奴役中。这就是永远没有人自己的自由的意思。至于自由的性质和源头，可参看前文（<a href="2870.htm">2870</a>-<a href="2893.htm">2893</a>节）；真自由在于被主引导（<a href="2890.htm">2890</a>节）。</p>

He with whom it is found shall be to me a servant. That this signifies that he with whom it is, shall be forever without his own freedom, is evident from the signification of a "servant," as being to 
be without one's own freedom (as above, n. 5760). The case is this. Joseph's silver cup, placed by his order with Benjamin, signifies interior truth (see n. 5736, 5747). He who is in interior truth knows 
that all truth and good are from the Lord, and also that all freedom from his own, or from the man himself, is infernal; for when a man thinks or does anything from his own freedom, he thinks and 
does nothing but evil. In consequence he is a servant of the devil, for all evil flows in from hell. He also feels delight in such freedom, because it agrees with the evil in which he is, and into which 
he was born. Wherefore this freedom from one's own must be put off, and heavenly freedom must be put on instead, which consists in willing what is good and thence doing it, and in desiring what is 
true and thence thinking it. When a man receives this freedom he is a servant of the Lord, and is then in freedom itself, and not in the bondage in which he was before, and which appeared like freedom. 
This then is what is meant by being forever without one's own freedom. (The nature and source of freedom may be seen above, n. 2870-2893; and also that freedom itself is to be led by the Lord, n. 2890.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5763</b></p><p><b>5763.</b>
'He with whom it is found will be my slave' means that the one with whom that thing is present will forever be without his freedom. This is clear from the meaning of 'slave' as being without one's freedom, 
as above in <a href="5760.htm">5760</a>. The implications of this are as follows: Joseph's cup made of silver, placed on Joseph's orders with Benjamin, means interior truth, <a href="5736.htm">5736</a>, <a href="5747.htm">5747</a>. Anyone in possession of interior 
truth knows that everything true and good comes from the Lord, also that all freedom of one's own or originating in a person himself is hellish freedom. For when a person is motivated by his own freedom 
to do or think something, he does and thinks nothing but evil. He is consequently the devil's slave, hell being the origin of all evil that flows in. He also has a feeling of delight in that freedom, 
because it fits in with the evil in which he is steeped and into which he was born. Consequently he needs to rid himself of the freedom which is his own and take on heavenly freedom instead, which 
consists in willing what is good and therefore doing what is good, and in desiring what is true and therefore thinking what is true. When a person receives this freedom he is the Lord's slave or servant, 
in which case he enjoys true freedom and is not in the slavery in which he had been previously and which seemed like freedom. This is what is meant by being forever without his own freedom. What 
the essence and origin of freedom are, see <a href="2870.htm">2870</a>, <a href="2893.htm">2893</a>; true freedom consists in being led by the Lord, <a href="2890.htm">2890</a>. </p>

`Cum quo invenitur, erit {1}servus meus':  quod significet quod apud quem id, is in perpetuum absque proprio libero erit, constat ex significatione `servi' quod sit absque proprio libero esse, ut supra 
n. 5760.  Cum hoc ita se habet:  scyphus argenti Josephi, positus jussu Josephi apud Benjaminem, significat verum interius, n. 5736, 5747; qui in vero interiore est, is novit quod omne verum et bonum 
sit a Domino, et quoque quod omne liberum ex proprio seu ex ipso homine, sit infernale; homo enim cum ex proprio libero aliquid facit et cogitat, non nisi quam malum facit et cogitat, inde est servus 
diaboli, ex inferno enim {2}omne malum influit; jucundum etiam in illo libero sentit, quia convenit malo in quo est et in quod natus est; quapropter proprium illud liberum exuendum est et pro illo 
induendum liberum caeleste, quod est velle bonum et inde facere bonum, (c)ac desiderare verum et inde cogitare verum; hoc liberum cum accipit, tunc est servus Domini, et tunc est in ipso libero, non 
autem in servo in quo prius quod apparuit ut liberum; hoc nunc est esse in perpetuum absque proprio libero; (x)quid liberum et unde, videatur n.{3} 2870-2893; et quod ipsum liberum sit duci a Domino,
