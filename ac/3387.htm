<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3387节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3387.</strong>“原来他怕说：她是我的妻子；恐怕这地方的人为利百加的缘故杀我”表他不可能自己透露神圣真理，因为这样神圣良善就不会被接受。这从“怕说”、“妻子”、“杀我”和“这地方的人”的含义清楚可知：“怕说”是指不能透露；“妻子”，就是此处的利百加，是指主的神圣理性的神圣真理（<a href="3012.htm">3012</a>，<a href="3013.htm">3013</a>，<a href="3077.htm">3077</a>节）；“杀我”是指良善不被接受，因为此处“我”所指的以撒代表主之理性的神圣良善（<a href="3012.htm">3012</a>，<a href="3194.htm">3194</a>，<a href="3210.htm">3210</a>节），当良善不被接受时，就说它被杀，或灭亡，因为它在不接受它的人身上不复存在；“这地方的人”是指那些拥有信之教义事物的人（<a href="3385.htm">3385</a>节）。从这些含义明显可知这些话的内义是什么，即：如果神圣真理本身被透露出去，它们就不会被那些拥有信之教义的人接受 ，因为这些真理超出他们一切理性领悟力，因而超出他们的全部信仰，结果，良善根本无法从主流入。因为来自主的良善，或神圣良善只能流入真理，真理是良善的器皿，如前面多次所示。<br />真理或真理的表象被赋予人，是为了神圣良善能形成他的理解力，从而形成这个人自己。真理存在的目的，是为了使良善能够流入，没有器皿或容器，良善就找不到居所，因为它找不到与自己相对应的状态。因此，哪里没有真理，或哪里真理不被接受，哪里就没有任何理性或人性的良善，结果这个人就没有任何属灵的生命。所以，为了人能拥有真理，从而拥有属灵的生命，真理的表象照各人的领悟力被赋予每个人；这些表象被视为真理，因数它们能含有神性事物在里面。<br />为了让人们了解何为表象，并且它们是诸如代替神圣真理而服务于人的那类事物，我们举例说明。若人被告知，在天堂，天使没有地方的概念，因而没有距离的概念，取而代之的是状态的概念，他绝不能理解这一点，因为这会使他以为那里没有独特和不同的事物，而是一切事物都融合在一起，也就是说，所有天使都在一个地方。然而，那里的一切事物都如此独特和不同，以致再没有更独特和不同的了。存在于自然界的地方、距离和空间在天堂作为状态存在（参看<a href="3356.htm">3356</a>节）。由此明显可知，凡圣言中关于地方和空间的论述，以及通过并藉由它们所形成的观念都是真理的表象；除非一切事物通过这类表象来陈述，否则，它根本不会被接受，结果几乎什么也不是；因为只要他在这个世界，也就是在时空之中，时空的观念就存在于人思维的几乎每一个细节中。<br />圣言照着涉及空间的表象说话，这一事实从圣言中几乎一切事物明显看出来，如马太福音：<br />耶稣问他们说，那么大卫怎么说，主对我主说：你坐在我的右手边，等我把你仇敌放在你的脚凳下。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.43.htm">22:43</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.44.htm">44</a>）<br />此处“坐在右手边”就出于空间的概念，因而是照着表象说的，而事实上，此处描述的是主的神性权能的状态。<br />耶稣，从今以后，你们要看见人子坐在那权能者的右手边，驾着天上的云降临。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.64.htm">26:64</a>）<br />此处“坐在右手边”，以及“驾着云降临”同样源于世人所具有的地方的概念；而天使所具有的概念是主之权能的状态的概念。马可福音：<br />西庇太的儿子对耶稣说，赐我们在你的荣耀里，让我们一个坐在你右手边，一个坐在你左手边。耶稣回答说，只是坐在我的右手边还是左手边，不是我可以赐的，乃是为谁预备的，就赐给谁。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.37.htm">10:37</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.40.htm">40</a>）<br />由此明显可知门徒对于主的国度持有何种观念，也就是说，一个坐在右手边，一个坐在左手边。由于他们具有这样的观念，故主也根据他们的理解力和他们所看到的表象回答他们。<br />诗篇：<br />他如同新郎出洞房，又如勇士欢然奔路。他从天这边出来，绕到天那边。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗19.5.htm">19:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗19.6.htm">6</a>）<br />这论及主，其神性权能的状态在此被描述为诸如属于空间的那类事物。以赛亚书：<br />路西弗啊，你这早晨之子何竟从天坠落！你心里曾说，我要升到天上！我要高举我的宝座在天上众星以上；我要升到高云之上。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.12.htm">14:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.14.htm">14</a>）<br />此处“从天坠落”、“升到天上”、“高举宝座在天上众星以上”、“升到高云之上”全都是源于空间或地方概念和表象的表述，用来描述自我之爱亵渎神圣事物。由于属天和属灵之物通过并照着此类可见物体呈现给世人，故天堂也被描述为在高处，而事实上，它并不在高处，而是在内在之物中（<a href="450.htm">450</a>，<a href="1380.htm">1380</a>，<a href="2148.htm">2148</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3387</b></p><p><b>3387.</b>
Because he feared to say, She is my woman; lest the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah. That this signifies that He could not open Divine truths themselves, because thus Divine good would not 
be received, is evident from the signification of "fearing to say," as being not to be able to open; from the signification of "woman," who here is Rebekah, as being the Lord's Divine rational as to 
Divine truth (n. 3012, 3013, 3077); from the signification of "slaying me," as being that good is not received, for by Isaac, who here is "me," is represented the Divine good of the Lord's rational (n. 
3012, 3194, 3210), for good is said to be slain, or to perish, when it is not received, because with him who does not receive it, it is nullified; and from the signification of the "men of the place," 
as being those who are in the doctrinal things of faith (n. 3385). From all this it now appears what is the internal sense of these words, namely, that if Divine truths themselves were to be opened, 
they would not be received by those who are in the doctrinal things of faith, because they surpass all their rational apprehension, thus all their belief, and consequently nothing of good from the 
Lord could flow in. For good from the Lord, or Divine good, can inflow solely into truths, because truths are the vessels of good, as often shown.  [2] Truths or appearances of truth are given man to 
the intent that Divine good may be able to form his understanding, and thus the man himself. For truths exist to the end that good may flow in; for without vessels or receptacles good finds no place, 
because it finds no state corresponding to itself; and therefore where there are no truths, or where they are not received, there is no rational or human good, consequently the man has no spiritual life. 
In order therefore that man may nevertheless have truths, and thereby have spiritual life, appearances of truth are given to everyone according to his apprehension; which appearances are acknowledged 
as truths, because they are such that Divine things can be in them. [3] In order that it may be known what appearances are, and that they are such things as serve man instead of truths Divine, let 
us take examples for illustration. If it should be said that in heaven there is no idea of place, thus none of distance, but that instead of these there are ideas of state, this could not possibly 
be apprehended by man, for this would cause him to believe that there nothing is distinct, but that everything is confused, that is, all in one, or together; when yet all things there are so distinct 
that nothing can be more so. (That the places, distances, and spaces, which exist in nature, are in heaven states, may be seen above, n. 3356.) Hence it is manifest that whatever is said in the Word concerning 
places and spaces, and from them and by means of them, is an appearance of truth; and unless it were said by means of such appearances, it would not be received at all, consequently would be 
scarcely anything; for so long as he is in the world, that is, in space and time, the idea of space and of time is within almost everything of man's thought, both in general and in particular. [4] That 
the language of the Word is according to appearances of space appears from almost everything in it; as in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Jesus asked them saying, How then doth David say, The Lord said to my Lord, 
Sit Thou on My right hand till I make Thine enemies Thy foot stool (Matt. 22:43, 44) where to "sit on the right hand" comes from the idea of place, thus according to appearance, when nevertheless what 
is here described is the state of the Lord's Divine power. Again: </p>
<p>     Jesus said, Henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming upon the clouds of heaven (Matt. 
26:64); </p>
<p>here in like manner "sitting on the right hand," and also "coming upon the clouds," are derived from the idea of place with men; but with angels the idea is of the Lord's power. In Mark: </p>
<p> 
    The sons of Zebedee said to Jesus, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on Thy right hand, and the other on Thy left hand, in Thy glory. Jesus answered, To sit on My right hand, and on My left, 
is not Mine to give, except to those for whom it hath been prepared (Mark. 10:37, 40). From this it is manifest what sort of an idea the disciples had concerning the Lord's kingdom, namely, that it was 
to sit on His right hand and on His left; and because they had such an idea, the Lord also answered them according to their apprehension, thus according to what appeared to them. [5] In David: </p>
<p>  
   He is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run his course. His going forth is from the end of the heavens and His circuit unto the ends of it (Ps. 19:5-6); </p>
<p>speaking 
of the Lord, whose state of Divine power is here described by such things as are of space. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the dawning! Thou saidst in thine 
heart, I will ascend into the heavens, I will exalt my throne above the stars of heaven;* I will ascend above the heights of the cloud (Isa. 14:12-14); </p>
<p>where "falling from heaven," "ascending into the 
heavens," "exalting the throne above the stars of heaven," "ascending above the heights of the cloud," all of which are expressions descriptive of the love of self profaning holy things, are all derived 
from the idea and appearance of space or place. Inasmuch as celestial and spiritual things are presented before man by means of such things as appear to men, and in accordance with such things, 
therefore heaven is also described as being on high, when yet it is not on high, but is in what is internal (n. 450, 1380, 2148). * The Hebrew is "stars of God;" and so Swedenborg renders the expression 
in Arcana Coelestia n. 257, 3708, 5313, 7375, 8678, and other places. The present reading therefore may be a slip of the pen, yet it is found also in Apocalypse Explained 1029, and 1108. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3387</b></p><p><b>3387.</b>
'For he was afraid to say, My wife, [thinking,] The men of the place may perhaps kill me on account of Rebekah' means that it was impossible for Divine Truths themselves to be disclosed, and so for Divine 
Good to be received. This is clear from the meaning of 'being afraid to say' as an inability to disclose; from the meaning of 'wife', who is Rebekah here, as the Lord's Divine Rational in respect 
to Divine Truth, dealt with in <a href="3012.htm">3012</a>, <a href="3013.htm">3013</a>, <a href="3077.htm">3077</a>; from the meaning of 'killing me' as good not being received, for 'Isaac', to whom 'me' refers here, represents the Divine Good of the Lord's Rational, <a href="3012.htm">3012</a>, <a href="3194.htm">3194</a>, <a href="3210.htm">3210</a> - good being said 'to be killed' or to perish when it is not received, for it ceases to exist with that person; and from the meaning of 'the men of the place' as people who possess 
matters of doctrine concerning faith, dealt with just above in <a href="3385.htm">3385</a>. From these meanings it is now evident what the internal sense of these words is, namely: If Divine truths themselves were disclosed 
they would not be received by those who possess matters of doctrine concerning faith because those truths go beyond the whole range of their rational grasp of things, and so go beyond the whole of their 
faith, and as a consequence of this no good at all could flow in from the Lord. For good from the Lord, or Divine good, cannot flow in except into truths, for truths are the vessels for good, as shown 
many times. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Truths or appearances of truth are given to a person to enable Divine Good to develop the understanding part of his mind, and so the person himself, for truths exist to the end 
that good may flow in. Indeed without vessels or receptacles good has nowhere to go, for it can find no condition answering to itself. Where no truths exist therefore, that is, where they have not been 
received, neither does any rational or human good exist; and as a consequence the person does not possess any spiritual life. Therefore, so that a person may nevertheless possess truths, and from these 
receive spiritual life, appearances of truth are given, to everyone according to his ability to grasp them; and these appearances are acknowledged as truths because they have the capacity to hold 
Divine things within them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 So that it may be known what appearances are and that they are what serve a person as Divine truths, let the following be used by way of illustration: If man were told 
that in heaven angels have no concept of place, and so no concept of distance, but that instead they have concepts of state, he could not possibly grasp it, for he would suppose from this that nothing 
distinct and separate existed but that everything was fused together, that is to say, all the angels were together in a single place. Yet everything there is so distinct and separate that nothing 
could ever be more so. Places, distances, and intervals of space which exist in the natural order exist in heaven as states, see <a href="3356.htm">3356</a>. From this it is evident that all the things that are stated in the 
Word about places and intervals of space between objects, also ideas that are formed from these and expressed through them, are appearances of truth; and unless everything were stated by means of those 
appearances it would in no way be received and would as a consequence be scarcely anything; for the concept of space and time is present in almost every single detail of a person's thought as long 
as he is in the world, that is, living within space and time. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The fact that the Word speaks according to appearances involving space is clear from almost every single part of it, as in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus 
said, How is it that David says, The Lord [said] to my Lord, Sit at My right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2022:43,%2044&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 22:43, 44</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the expression 'sitting at the right hand' 
is derived from the concept of place and so according to the appearance - when in fact it is a state of the Lord's Divine power which is described by that expression. In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus 
said, Hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2026:64&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 26:64</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here similarly 'sitting at the right hand' and also 'coming on clouds' 
are expressions derived from men's concept of place, whereas the concept angels have is one of the state of the Lord's power. In Mark, </p>
<blockquote>
The sons of Zebedee said to Jesus, Grant us to sit in Your glory, 
one on Your right hand and the other on Your left. Jesus replied, To sit at My right hand and at My left is not Mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2010:37,%2040&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 10:37, 40</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From 
this it is evident what kind of concept the disciples had of the Lord's kingdom, that is to say, one that involved sitting on the right hand and on the left. Such being the concept they had of 
it the Lord also replied to them in a way they could understand and so by an appearance that could be seen by them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, he rejoices as a mighty 
man to run the course. From the end of the heavens is His going forth, and His circuit to the ends of them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2019:5,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 19:5, 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord, the state of whose Divine power is described 
by means of such things as belong to space. In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
How you have fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the dawn! You said in your heart, I will go up into the heavens, above the stars of God<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> I 
will raise my throne. I will go up above the heights of the clouds. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2014:12-14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 14:12-14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Falling from heaven', 'going up the heavens', 'raising a throne above the stars of God', 'going up above the heights 
of the clouds' are all expressions derived from the concept and appearance of space or a place, and are used to describe self-love profaning holy things. Since celestial and spiritual things are presented 
to man by means of and according to visual objects like these, heaven too is therefore described as being on high when in fact it is not on high but in that which is internal, <a href="450.htm">450</a>, <a href="1380.htm">1380</a>, <a href="2148.htm">2148</a>.

`Quia timuit dicere, Mulier mea; forte occidant me viri loci propter Rebeccam': quod significet quod non potuit aperire ipsa Divina Vera, sic Divinum Donum non reciperetur, constat ex significatione 
`timere dicere' quod sit {1}non posse aperire; ex significatione `mulieris,' hic Rebeccae, quod sit Divinum Rationale quoad Divinum Verum, de qua n. 3012, 3013, 3077; ex significatione `occidere me' 
quod sit non recipi bonum, per `Jishakum' enim, qui hic est `me,' repraesentatur Divinum Bonum Rationalis Domini, n. 3012, 3194, 3210; tunc enim bonum dicitur `occidi' seu perire cum non recipitur, nam 
fit nullum apud eum; et ex significatione `virorum loci' quod sunt illi qui in doctrinalibus fidei, de qua mox supra n. 3385; ex his nunc patet quis sensus internus illorum verborum est, nempe si aperirentur 
ipsa Vera Divina, quod ab illis qui in doctrinalibus fidei, non reciperentur, quia omnem eorum rationalem captum, ita omnem eorum fidem, excedunt, et consequenter nihil boni a Domino influere 
posset; bonum enim a Domino, seu Bonum Divinum, non influere potest nisi in vera, sunt enim vera vasa boni, ut multoties ostensum; [2] (m){2}vera seu apparentiae veri sunt homini data propterea ut Divinum 
Bonum queat intellectuale ejus formare, ita ipsum hominem, nam ob finem ut influere possit bonum, sunt vera; bonum enim absque vasis seu receptaculis non invenit locum, {3}quia non statum sibi 
correspondentem, (n) quapropter ubi non vera, seu ubi illa non recepta, ibi nec bonum rationale {4}aut humanum, consequenter non homini aliqua vita spiritualis; ut itaque usque homini sint vera, et illi 
inde vita spiritualis, dantur apparentiae veri, et quidem cuivis secundum suum captum, quae apparentiae agnoscuntur pro veris quia sunt tales ut in illis Divina possint esse. [3] Ut sciatur quid apparentiae 
et quod illae sint quae pro veris Divinis homini inserviunt, sint illustrationi exempla: si diceretur quod in caelo nulla idea loci, ita nulla distantiae sit, sed quod pro illis sint ideae status, 
hoc ab homine nequaquam capi posset, sic enim crederet quod nihil distinctum foret, sed confusum, omnes nempe in uno seu simul, cum tamen omnia ibi tam distincta sunt ut nusquam distinctius dari 
queat; quod loca, distantiae et spatia quae in natura, sint status in caelo, videatur n. 3356; inde patet quod quicquid usque in Verbo dicitur de locis et spatiis, et ex illis, (c)et per illa, sint 
apparentiae veri, et nisi per apparentias illas diceretur, nusquam reciperetur, consequenter vix aliquid, nam idea {5}spatii et temporis inest paene omnibus et singulis cogitationis apud hominem, {6}quamdiu 
est in mundo, hoc est, in spatio et tempore: [4] quod secundum apparentias spatii locutum sit in Verbo, constat paene ab omnibus et singulis ibi, ut apud Matthaeum,           Dixit Jesus, Quomodo 
dicit David, Dominus Domino meo,      Sede a dextris Meis, donec posuero inimicos tuos scabellum      pedum tuorum? xxii 41, 42 [A.V. 43, 44]; </p>
<p>ubi `sedere a dextris' est ex idea loci, ita secundum 
apparentiam, cum tamen est status potentiae Divinae Domini qui {7}sic describitur: apud eundem,            Jesus dixit, Ex nunc videbitis Filium hominis sedentem ex      dextris  potentiae, et venientem 
super nubibus caeli, xxvi 64; </p>
<p>similiter hic `sedere a dextris' ut et `venire super nubibus' sunt ex idea loci hominibus, sed {8}est idea status potentiae Domini angelis: apud Marcum,       
    Filii Zebedaei dixerunt ad Jesum, Da nobis ut unus a      dextris Tuis, et alter a sinistris Tuis sedeamus in gloria      Tua: Jesus respondit, Sedere a dextris Meis, et (c)a      sinistris Meis, 
non est Meum dare, sed quibus paratum est, x      37, 40; </p>
<p>inde patet qualem ideam de regno Domini {9}habuerunt discipuli, quod nempe esset `sedere a dextris et a sinistris'; et quia illis talis idea, 
etiam Dominus secundum captum eorum respondit, ita secundum quod apparuit illis: [5] apud Davidem,           Hic sicut sponsus exiens e conclavi suo, gaudet sicut      heros ad currendum viam, 
a fine caelorum exitus Ipsius, et      circuitio Ipsius ad fines eorum, Ps. xix 6, 7 [A.V. 5, 6]; </p>
