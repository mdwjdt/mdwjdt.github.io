<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1782节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1782.</strong>“母牛犊”、“母山羊”、“公绵羊”代表教会的属天之物，而“斑鸠”和“雏鸽”则代表该教会的属灵之物（9节）。教会在这一边，主在那一边（10节）。主会驱散邪恶与虚假（11节）。但虚假仍会继续骚扰它（12，13节）。必有从这些虚假当中的一个解脱（14节）。因此，主会得到安慰（15节）。然而，邪恶会占据它（16节）。最终只有虚假和恶欲在那里居于主导地位（17节）。这时，主的国会到来，经上描述了一个新教会及其延伸（18节）。经上提到的那些民族是指要从该教会被逐出的邪恶与虚假（19-21节）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1782.</strong> The heifer, she-goat, and ram represent the church's heavenly aspects, while the turtledove and chick represent its spiritual aspects (verse 9). The church is on one side and the Lord on the other (verse 10). The Lord routed evil and falsity (verse 11), but falsity still plagued the church (verses 12, 13). The church was delivered from falsity (verse 14), so the Lord was comforted (verse 15). Evil would seize control, however (verse 16), and in the end, false ideas and evil cravings would be in complete control (verse 17). Then the Lord's kingdom and a new religion would arrive, whose extent is described (verse 18). The false thoughts and evil urges to be driven out are meant by the nations mentioned (verses 19, 20, 21). </p>

The "heifer," "she-goat," and "ram," are the representatives of the celestial things of the church; the "turtledove" and the "young pigeon" are the representatives of its spiritual things (verse 9). 
The church was on one side, and the Lord on the other (verse 10). The Lord would dissipate evils and falsities (verse 11). But the falsities would still infest it (verses 12, 13). From these there should 
be deliverance (verse 14). Thus the Lord received consolation (verse 15). But that evils would take possession (verse 16). And at last nothing but falsities and cupidities would reign (verse 17). 
Then would come the Lord's kingdom, and a new church, the extension of which is described (verse 18). The falsities and evils to be expelled from it are the nations named (verses 19-21). </p>

The heifer, she-goat, and ram are representatives of the celestial things of the Church, while the turtle dove and the fledgling are representatives of the spiritual things of the same, verse 9. The 
Church was on one side, the Lord on the other, verse 10. The Lord would disperse evils and falsities, verse 11. But falsities would continue to infest it, verses 12, 13. From those falsities there would 
be deliverance, verse 14, and so the Lord would experience comfort, verse 15. Evils however would take possession of it, verse 16, and in the end nothing but falsities and evil desires would reign 
there, verse 17. At this point the Lord's kingdom would come, and a new Church, the extension of which is described, verse 18. The falsities and evils that were to be expelled from it are the nations 
mentioned in verses 19-21. </p>

dissiparet, vers. 11: sed quod usque falsa infestarent illam, vers. 12, 13: a quibus liberatio, vers. 14 ita Domino consolatio, vers. 15: sed quod mala occupatura, vers. 16: et ultimo non nisi quam 
falsitates et cupiditates regnaturae, vers. 17: quod tunc regnum Domini, et nova Ecclesia, cujus extensio describitur, vers. 18: falsa et mala inde expellenda sunt 'gentes' nominatae, vers. 19-21. </p>
