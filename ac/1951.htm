<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1951节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1951.</strong>“他必住在众兄弟的对面”表关于信之事物的不断争斗，但理性真理仍将是征服者。在圣言中，论及以实玛利后代的那些话对这个问题描述得更充分：<br />他们居住的是从哈腓拉直到埃及对面的书珥，正在亚述的道上。（他的命运）专门跟他的众兄弟作对。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创25.18.htm">25:18</a>）<br />这些话的内义从哈腓拉、书珥、埃及、亚述的含义明显看出来：“哈腓拉”表属聪明之物，这从前面的说明清楚可知（<a href="115.htm">115</a>节）；“书珥”表源于记忆知识的真理（如前所述，<a href="1928.htm">1928</a>节）；“埃及”表属知识的一切（<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>，<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>节）；“亚述”表属理性之物（<a href="119.htm">119</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>节）；从所有这些名字（当用在一起以至于表现为一个概念时）的含义明显可知，以实玛利代表这样的理性。在来世，这种真理以种种方式来代表，不过，总表现为强劲、有力、坚硬之物，以至于它根本不可抗拒。灵人仅仅想到这种真理，就会感到恐惧。因为它的性质就是不屈服，因而不后退。由此我们也可以明白“必住在众兄弟的对面”表示什么。谁都知道这段描述里面隐藏着一个奥秘，但它的性质至今不为人知。</p>

He shall dwell against the faces of all his brethren. That this signifies that there will be continual contentions about matters of faith, but that nevertheless it will be a conqueror, is evident from 
what has just been said; which is yet more fully described where the Word tells of the posterity of Ishmael, in these words: </p>
<p>     They dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is toward the faces of Egypt, 
as one comes to Asshur, (his lot) fell toward the faces of all his brethren (Gen. 25:18), of which words the internal sense is evident from the signification of Havilah, Shur, Egypt, and Assyria. 
"Havilah" signifies that which is of intelligence (as appears from what has been shown in n. 115); "Shur" signifies truth proceeding from memory-knowledges (spoken of above, n. 1928); "Egypt," all that 
is of memory-knowledge (n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462); and "Assyria," that which belongs to reason (n. 119, 1186); from the significations of all which, when reduced into one general meaning, it is evident 
that by Ishmael is represented such a rational. This very kind of truth is represented in the other life in various ways, and always as what is strong, powerful, and hard; insomuch that it cannot 
be resisted at all. When spirits merely think of such truth, something of terror comes over them, because it is its nature not to yield, and thus not to recede; from which also we may see what is meant 
by "dwelling against the faces of all his brethren." Anyone may know that an arcanum lies hidden in this description, but of what nature has hitherto been unknown. </p>

'And he will dwell in opposition to<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> all his brothers' means incessant strife against things of faith, but rational truth will nevertheless be the conqueror. This is clear from what has just been stated, 
and the matter is described more fully still where the descendants of Ishmael are referred to, in these words, </p>
<blockquote>
They dwelt from Havilah to Shur which is opposite Egypt<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> as you come towards Asshur. 
(His lot) fell opposite all his brothers.<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2025:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 25:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The internal sense of these words is evident from the meaning of Havilah, Shur, Egypt, and Assyria. 'Havilah' means that which is connected 
with intelligence, as is evident from what has been shown in <a href="115.htm">115</a>. 'Shur' means truth stemming from facts, dealt with above in <a href="1928.htm">1928</a>, 'Egypt' everything that is connected with knowledge, <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>, <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>, and 'Assyria' that which is connected with reason, <a href="119.htm">119</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>. From the meanings of these names when used together so as to present a single concept it is clear that Ishmael represents such 
a rational. In the next life such truth is represented in various ways, but always as that which is strong, powerful, and hard, to such a degree that it cannot be resisted at all. The mere thought 
of such truth produces in spirits a sense of terror for the reason that its nature is such that it does not yield, and so does not retreat. These considerations also show what is meant by 'dwelling in 
opposition to<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> all his brothers'. Anyone may recognize that an arcanum lies within this description, but up to now the nature of it has not been known.

Quod `contra facies omnium fratrum suorum habitabit' significet quod continuae contentiones in iis quae fidei sunt sed quod usque victor erit, constat ex illis quae nunc dicta sunt, quod adhuc plenius 
describitur ubi de Ismaelis posteris agitur, his verbis, 	Habitaverunt a Havilah usque ad Shur, quod ad fac Aegypti, qua venitur in Asshur, ad facies omnium fratrum cecidit (sors), Gen. xxv 18; </p>
<p>quorum 
sensus internus paret a significatione Havilah, Shur, Aegypti et Assyriae {2}; `Havilah' significat illud quod est intelligentiae, ut patet ab illis quae ostensa n. 115: `Shur' verum {1} procedens 
a scientificis, qua supra n. 1928; `Aegyptus' omne quod est scientiae, n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462; et `Assyriae {2}' quod est rationis, n. 119, 1186; ex quorum significationibus in unum sensum redactis 
constat quod per `Ismaelem' tale rationale repraesentetur.  Ipsum tale verum in altera vita repraesentative variis modis sistitur, et semper ut forte, validum, durum, adeo ut prorsus resisti nequeat; 
dum modo (t)spiritus cogitant de tali vero, obvenit quoddam terroris, ex causa quia natura ejus est ut non cedat, ita nec recedat; ex quibus etiam constare potest, quid per `habitare contra facies 
omnium fratrum' [significatum] sit: quisquis scire potest quod in descriptione hac arcanum lateat, sed quale, hucusque nescitum. 	@1 i quod sit.$ 	@2 Aschur.$ </p>
