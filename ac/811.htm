<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>811.</strong>“它们都从地上被除灭了”表终结，即上古教会断了气。“只留下挪亚和那些与他同在方舟里的”表那些组成新教会的人被保存下来。“那些与他同在方舟里的”表属于新教会的所有事物。所有这些含义自明，无须多说。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]811.</strong> They were obliterated from the earth sums it up by saying that the earliest church passed away. Noah alone was left, and what was with him in the ark, means that those who made up the new church were kept alive, what was with him in the ark being everything that belonged to the new church. These things also need no further explanation, because they are self-evident. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 811</b></p><p><b>811.</b>
And they were destroyed from the earth. That this is the conclusion, namely, that the Most Ancient Church expired; and that by "Noah only was left, and that which was with him in the ark" is signified 
that they were preserved who constituted the new church; and that by "that which was with him in the ark" are signified all things that were of the new church, needs no further explication, being self-evident. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 811</b></p><p><b>811.</b>
'They were wiped out from the earth' is the finish, namely that the Most Ancient Church breathed its last. 'Noah alone remained and that which was with him in the ark' means that those who constituted 
the new Church were preserved. And 'that which was with him in the ark' means all the things which belonged to that new Church. No further explanation of these statements is necessary- since they are 
self-evident. </p>

</p><b>811.</b>
Quod 'deleta sunt e terra' sit conclusio, quod Antiquissima Ecclesia exspiraverit, et quod 'relictus tantum Noah et quod cum illo in arca' significent quod conservati qui novam Ecclesiam constituerunt; 
et quod 'cum illo in arca' significent omnia quae novae Ecclesiae, nec opus habent explicatione ulteriore, quia ex se patent. </p>
