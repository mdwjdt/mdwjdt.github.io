<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第583节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>583.</strong>“伟人”就是基于我欲的所谓“勇士”。这一点也可从圣言的很多经文清楚看出来，在这些经文中，这类人被称为“勇士”，如耶利米书：<br />巴比伦的勇士止息争战，藏在坚垒之中。他们的勇力衰尽，好像妇女一样。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.30.htm">51:30</a>）<br />此处“巴比伦的勇士”是指那些被我欲吞噬的人。耶利米书：<br />有刀剑临到说谎的人，他们就疯狂。有刀剑临到她的勇士，他们就惊惶。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.36.htm">51:36</a>）<br />我已看见它。他们惊惶，转身退后。他们的勇士被碾碎，拼命逃离，并不回头，四周惶恐！快跑的不能逃避，勇士不能逃脱。骑上你的马匹，架上你的车辆疯狂急行吧！勇士，就是古实人、弗人、路德族，都出去吧！（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶46.5.htm">46:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶46.6.htm">6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶46.9.htm">9</a>）<br />这是指推理出来的信服。耶利米书：<br />你们怎么说，我们是勇士，是有勇力打仗的呢？摩押变为荒场。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶48.14.htm">48:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶48.15.htm">15</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />加略被攻取，保障也被占据。到那日，摩押的勇士心中疼痛如临产的妇人。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶48.41.htm">48:41</a>）<br />耶利米49:22同样说到“以东勇士的心”。耶利米书：<br />因耶和华救赎了雅各，救赎他脱离比他更强之人的手。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.11.htm">31:11</a>）<br />这里对“勇士”有不同的表述。亚纳人起源于伟人，被说成是“勇士”，这一事实在摩西五经中清楚可见：<br />你今日要过约旦河，进去赶出比你又大又多的国民，得着广大坚固、高得顶天的城邑。那民是亚衲人的众子，又大又高，是你所知道的；也曾听见有人指着他们说：谁能在亚衲人的众子面前站立得住呢？（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申9.1.htm">9:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申9.2.htm">2</a>）</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]583.</strong> The fact that the Nephilim are called mighty men from their love for themselves can be seen in many places in the Word where such people are referred to as strong. In Jeremiah, for instance:<br />The mighty of Babylon stopped fighting; they sit in their strongholds; their might fails; they have turned into women. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_583/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_51_30" target=_top>Jeremiah 51:30</a>)<br />The mighty of Babylon stand for those who have fallen into the trap of self-love. In the same author:<br />A sword against liars — and they will lose their minds; a sword against its mighty — and they will feel dismay. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_583/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_50_36" target=_top>Jeremiah 50:36</a>)<br />In the same author:<br />I saw: they were dismayed and turned back. Their mighty were crushed; they fled madly and did not look back. Terror all around! The swift will not flee nor the mighty escape. Go up, horses,{*1} and run mad, chariots. Let your mighty ones leave, Cush, Put,{*2} and Lydians. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_583/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_46_5-6" target=_top>Jeremiah 46:5-6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_583/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_46_9" target=_top>9</a>)<br />This is about using rationalization to delude oneself. In the same author:<br />How can you say, "We are mighty ones and men strong in war"? Moab has been devastated. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_583/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_48_14-15" target=_top>Jeremiah 48:14-15</a>)<br />In the same author:<br />The city was captured, as were its fortifications; it was occupied. And the heart of the mighty of Moab on that day became like the heart of a woman in agony. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_583/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_48_41" target=_top>Jeremiah 48:41</a>)<br /><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_583/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_49_22" target=_top>Jeremiah 49:22</a> similarly mentions "the heart of the mighty of Edom." In the same author:<br />Jehovah has ransomed Jacob and won him back from the hand of one mightier than he. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_583/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_31_11" target=_top>Jeremiah 31:11</a>)<br />This passage uses a different [Hebrew] word for "mighty."{*3} It can be seen in Moses that the Anakim (who were offspring of the Nephilim) were described as strong:<br />You are crossing the Jordan today, arriving to take possession of nations larger and more numerous than you, of cities large and fortified to the sky, of a people large and tall, the children of the Anakim, whom you know. And you have heard, "Who will stand up to the children of the Anakim?" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_583/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_9_1-2" target=_top>Deuteronomy 9:1-2</a>)<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The translation here is based on reading "Go up, horses" (ascendite equi) for the first Latin edition's "Mount the horses" (ascendite equos). The reading "Go up, horses" occurs when this same biblical passage is quoted in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_583/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1164" target=_top>1164:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_583/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1195" target=_top>1195</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_583/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2799#subsection-2-16" target=_top>2799:16</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_583/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5321#subsection-2-11" target=_top>5321:11</a>. [LHC]<br />{*2} "Cush" here refers to Ethiopia (see note 4 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_583/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_73" target=_top>73</a>) and "Put" to Libya. [LHC]<br />{*3} The Hebrew word for "mighty" in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_583/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_4" target=_top>Genesis 6:4</a> and in the previous quotes from Jeremiah is גִבּוֹר (gibbôr). The word in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_583/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_31_11" target=_top>Jeremiah 31:11</a> is חָזָק (ḥāzāq). The former word, gibbôr, is related to גֶּבֶר (geḇer), "man," and is used exclusively of males — whether human or animal. The second of the two words for "mighty," ḥāzāq, seems to have a connotation of hardness and is used of metals, wind, sounds, and swords as well as of people, animals, and God. [LHC, GFD] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 583</b></p><p><b>583.</b>
That the Nephilim are called "mighty men" from the love of self, is evident from various passages of the Word, where such are called "mighty"; as in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>The mighty ones of Babel have ceased to 
fight, they sit in their holds, their might faileth, they are become as women (Jer. 51:30), where the "mighty ones of Babel" denote those who are eaten up with the love of self. In the same: </p>
<p>     A 
sword is against the liars, and they shall be insane, a sword is against her mighty ones, and they shall be dismayed (Jer. 50:36). Again: </p>
<p>     I saw them dismayed, and turning away back, their mighty 
ones were broken in pieces, and have been put to flight, and looked not back; fear was round about; the swift shall not flee away, nor the mighty one escape; come up, ye horses, and rage, ye chariots, 
and let the mighty ones go forth, Cush, Put, the Lydians (Jer. 46:5-6, 9), speaking of persuasion from reasonings. Again: </p>
<p>     How say ye, We are mighty, and men of strength for war? Moab is laid 
waste (Jer. 48:14-15). Again: </p>
<p>     The city is taken, and the strongholds, it has been seized, and the heart of the mighty men of Moab in that day is become as the heart of a woman in her pangs (Jer. 
48:41). In like manner it is said: </p>
<p>     The heart of the mighty ones of Edom (Jer. 49:22). Again: </p>
<p>     Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob, and hath avenged him from the hand of him that was mightier 
than he (Jer. 31:11), where "mighty" is expressed by another term. That the Anakim, who were of the Nephilim, were called "mighty ones" is evident from Moses: </p>
<p>     Thou passest over Jordan today, to 
go in to possess nations greater and more numerous than thyself, cities great and fortified to heaven, a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard; 
who shall stand before the sons of Anak? (Deut. 9:1-2). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 583</b></p><p><b>583.</b>
'The Nephilim' were called 'mighty' on account of their self-love. This too is clear from many passages in the Word where such people are called 'mighty', as in Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
The mighty ones of Babel 
have ceased fighting; they are seated in their strongholds; their might is deserting them, they have become like women. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2051:30&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 51:30</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'the mighty ones of Babel' stands for those who are eaten 
up with self-love. In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
A sword against the liars, and they will go mad. A sword against her mighty ones, and they will be thrown into confusion. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2050:36&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 50:36</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, 
 </p>
<blockquote>
I have seen it. They have been thrown into confusion and are turning backward. Their mighty ones have been crushed and have surely fled, and they have not looked back - terror all around! 
The swift will not flee away, nor the mighty one escape. Mount your horses, and drive your chariots madly on; let the mighty ones go forth - Cush, Put, the Ludim. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2046:5,%206,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 46:5, 6, 9</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to persuasion 
resulting from reasonings. In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
How do you say, We are mighty, and men of strength for war? Moab has been laid waste. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2048:14,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 48:14, 15</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
The city 
has been taken and its strongholds, possession has been taken of it. The heart of the mighty ones of Moab on that day will be like the heart of a woman in labour. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2048:41&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 48:41</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Chapter 49:22 similarly 
speaks of 'the heart of the mighty ones of Edom'. In the same prophet,  </p>
<p>Jehovah has redeemed Jacob, and has reclaimed him from the hand of one mightier than himself. Jer 31:11.  </p>
<p>Here a different 
[Hebrew] expression is used for 'mighty'. The fact that the Anakim, who descended from the Nephilim, were spoken of as 'mighty ones' is clear in Moses,  </p>
<p>You are crossing the Jordan today, going 
to dispossess nations greater and more numerous than yourself, cities great and fortified up to heaven, a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim whom you know, and of whom you have heard it said, 
Who will stand before the sons of Anak? Deut. 9:1, <a href="2.htm">2</a>.
