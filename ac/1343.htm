<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1343节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1343.</strong>“希伯”是一个民族，即希伯来民族，它以其祖先希伯为名，表示第二代古教会大体上的敬拜。这从圣言历史部分中有关它的论述清楚可知。由于一种新的敬拜形式始于这个民族，故具有类似敬拜的人都被称为希伯来人。他们的敬拜属于后来在雅各后代中重新恢复的那一种。其主要特征是，他们呼求他们的神耶和华，并且他们也有祭祀。上古教会一致承认主，称祂为耶和华，这从创世记头几章，以及圣言其它经文明显看出来。古教会，也就是洪水后的这个教会也承认主，称祂为耶和华，尤其那些具有内在敬拜、被称为“闪的儿子”之人。剩下的人，也就是具有外在敬拜的人也承认耶和华，并敬拜祂。但当内在敬拜变得外在，尤其变成偶像崇拜，各个民族都有了自己所拜的神明时，希伯来民族仍保留了耶和华这个名，称他们的神是耶和华，并因此与其它民族区分开来。<br />雅各的后代，包括摩西本人，连同外在敬拜一起迷失在埃及，他们甚至不知道他们的神叫耶和华。所以，他们首先被教导，耶和华是希伯来人的神，是亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各的神，这从摩西书清楚可知：<br />耶和华对摩西说，你和以色列的长老要去见埃及王，对他说，耶和华希伯来人的神遇见了我们，现在求你容我们往旷野去，走三天的路程，为要祭祀耶和华我们的神。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出3.18.htm">3:18</a>）<br /><br />法老说，耶和华是谁，使我听他的话，容以色列人去呢？我不认识耶和华，也不容以色列人去。他们说，希伯来人的神遇见了我们，求你容我们往旷野去，走三天的路程，祭祀耶和华我们的神。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出5.2.htm">5:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出5.3.htm">3</a>）<br />雅各的后代，连同这敬拜一起迷失在埃及，他们甚至不知道耶和华的名。这从摩西书清楚可知：<br />摩西对神说，看哪，我到以色列人那里，对他们说，你们祖宗的神打发我到你们这里来。他们若问我说，祂叫什么名字？我要对他们说什么呢？神对摩西说，我是自有永有的。又说，你要对以色列人这样说，那自有的打发我到你们这里来。神又对摩西说，你要对以色列人这样说，耶和华你们祖宗的神，就是亚伯拉罕的神，以撒的神，雅各的神，打发我到你们这里来。耶和华是我的名，直到永远。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出3.13.htm">3:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出3.15.htm">15</a>）<br />由此明显可知，就连摩西也不知道这一点，他们因耶和华的名，就是希伯来人的神而与其他人区分开来。因此，耶和华在别处也被称为希伯来人的神，出埃及记：<br />你要对法老说，耶和华希伯来人的神打发我来见你。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出7.16.htm">7:16</a>）<br />你进去见法老，对他说，耶和华希伯来人的神这样说。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出9.1.htm">9:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出9.13.htm">13</a>）<br />摩西、亚伦就进去见法老，对他说，耶和华希伯来人的神这样说。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出10.3.htm">10:3</a>）<br />约拿书：<br />我是希伯来人，我敬畏耶和华，那天上的神。（约拿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/拿1.9.htm">1:9</a>）<br />撒母耳记：<br />非利士人听见欢呼的声音，就说，在希伯来人营里大声欢呼，是什么缘故呢？随后就知道耶和华的约柜到了营中。非利士人说，我们有祸了！谁能救我们脱离这些大能之神的手呢？从前在旷野用各样灾殃击打埃及人的，就是这些神。非利士人哪，你们要作大丈夫，免得作希伯来人的奴仆。（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上4.6.htm">4:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上4.8.htm">8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上4.9.htm">9</a>）<br />此处也很明显，各民族因他们所呼求的神之名而彼此区分，希伯来人因耶和华的名而被区分开来。<br />希伯来民族敬拜的第二个本质特征是祭祀，这也可从上面所引及的经文（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出3.18.htm">3:18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出5.2.htm">5:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出5.3.htm">3</a>）明显看出来，还可从以下事实看出：埃及人由于这种敬拜形式而厌恶希伯来民族，这从摩西书清楚可知：<br />摩西说，这样行本不相宜，因为我们要把埃及人所厌恶的祭祀耶和华我们的神；看哪，若把埃及人所厌恶的，在他们眼前献为祭，他们岂不拿石头打死我们吗？（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出8.26.htm">8:26</a>）<br />所以，埃及人也十分厌恶希伯来民族，以致他们拒绝“和希伯来人一同吃饭”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创43.32.htm">43:32</a>）。由此还明显可知，构成希伯来民族的不仅有雅各的后代，还包括凡具有这类敬拜的所有人。这也是为何在约瑟时代，迦南地被称为希伯来人之地：<br />约瑟说，我实在是从希伯来人之地被拐来的。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创40.15.htm">40:15</a>）<br />迦南地的偶像崇拜者有祭祀，这从很多经文清楚可知，因为他们祭祀自己的神，如巴力等。而且，来自叙利亚，即希伯曾生活的地方，就是希伯来民族的发源地，并在雅各的后代之前进入迦南地的巴兰，不仅以祭祀拜神，而且称他的神为耶和华。至于巴兰来自叙利亚，即希伯来民族发源地的事实，可参看民数记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.7.htm">23:7</a>）；他也祭祀（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民22.39.htm">22:39</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民22.40.htm">40</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.1.htm">23:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.29.htm">29</a>）；他称他的神为耶和华（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民22.18.htm">22:18</a>）等等。创世记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/创8.20.htm">8:20</a>）提到挪亚向耶和华向燔祭，尽管这不是真实的历史，而是虚构的历史，因为“燔祭”表敬拜的圣洁，这可见于那里的故事。由此明显可知“希伯”或“希伯来民族”所表之义。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1343.</strong> The fact that Eber was a nation, called the Hebrew nation after its forefather, and that it symbolizes this second ancient church's worship in general, can be seen from the Word's narrative parts, which mention the Hebrew nation in many places.{*1} Since a new form of worship began with that nation, everyone who worshiped in a similar way was called Hebrew. Their worship was like the type of worship later restored among Jacob's descendants. Its leading characteristic was its practice of referring to its God as Jehovah and offering sacrifices.<br />With one heart the earliest church acknowledged the Lord and called him Jehovah, as can be seen from the early chapters of Genesis and other places in the Word.{*2} The ancient church (the church that followed the Flood) — and especially the individuals in it whose worship had depth and who were called Shem's children — also acknowledged the Lord and called him Jehovah. The rest, who engaged in shallow worship, acknowledged and worshiped Jehovah as well. But that church's inward worship eventually turned shallow and, even worse, idolatrous, and each nation began to have its own god that it worshiped. Then the Hebrew nation kept the name of Jehovah and used that name for their God, which distinguished them from the other nations.<br />[2] Jacob's descendants in Egypt lost not only their outward form of worship but also the knowledge that their God was called Jehovah. Even Moses himself did. So first of all they were informed that Jehovah was the God of the Hebrews, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as the following words in Moses show:<br />Jehovah said to Moses, "You shall go in — you and the elders of Israel — to the king of Egypt and say to him, ‘Jehovah, God of the Hebrews, has come to meet us; and now let us go, please, on a journey of three days into the wilderness and sacrifice to Jehovah our God.'" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1343/bible_king-james-version_exodus_3_18" target=_top>Exodus 3:18</a>)<br />In the same author:<br />Pharaoh said, "Who is Jehovah that I should listen to his voice, to send Israel away? I do not know Jehovah and will not send Israel away, either." And they said, "The God of the Hebrews has come to meet us. Please let us go a journey of three days into the wilderness, and let us sacrifice to Jehovah our God." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1343/bible_king-james-version_exodus_5_2-3" target=_top>Exodus 5:2-3</a>)<br />[3] The following words in Moses show that along with losing their form of worship, Jacob's descendants in Egypt also lost the knowledge of Jehovah's name:<br />Moses said to God, "But when I come to the children of Israel and tell them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they say to me, ‘What is his name?' — what should I tell them?" And God said to Moses, "I Am Who I Am." And he said, "This is what you shall say to the children of Israel: ‘I Am has sent me to you.'" And God said further to Moses, "This is what you shall say to the children of Israel: ‘Jehovah, the God of your ancestors — the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob — has sent me to you.' This is my name forever." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1343/bible_king-james-version_exodus_3_13-14" target=_top>Exodus 3:13-14</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1343/bible_king-james-version_exodus_3_15" target=_top>15</a>)<br />[4] This makes it clear that Moses too did not know, and that Jacob's descendants were distinguished from all others by use of the name Jehovah, God of the Hebrews. That is why Jehovah is called God of the Hebrews in other places as well:<br />"You shall say to Pharaoh, ‘Jehovah, God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you.'" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1343/bible_king-james-version_exodus_7_16" target=_top>Exodus 7:16</a>)<br />"Go in to Pharaoh and speak to him: ‘This is what Jehovah, God of the Hebrews, has said.'" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1343/bible_king-james-version_exodus_9_1" target=_top>Exodus 9:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1343/bible_king-james-version_exodus_9_13" target=_top>13</a>)<br />Moses went in — as did Aaron — to Pharaoh, and they said to him, "This is what Jehovah, God of the Hebrews, has said." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1343/bible_king-james-version_exodus_10_3" target=_top>Exodus 10:3</a>)<br />In Jonah:<br />I am a Hebrew, and I fear Jehovah, God of the heavens. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1343/bible_king-james-version_jonah_1_9" target=_top>Jonah 1:9</a>)<br />In Samuel as well:<br />The Philistines heard the sound of shouting. They said, "What is the sound of this great shouting in the camp of the Hebrews?" And they realized that the ark of Jehovah had come to the camp. The Philistines said, "Alas for us! Who will free us from the hand of these majestic gods? These are the gods that struck the Egyptians with every plague in the wilderness. Turn into men, Philistines, or you will be slaves to the Hebrews." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1343/bible_king-james-version_1-samuel_4_6" target=_top>1 Samuel 4:6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1343/bible_king-james-version_1-samuel_4_8-9" target=_top>8-9</a>)<br />Here too it is evident that the nations were identified by their gods, whom they would name, and that the Hebrew nation was identified with Jehovah.<br />[5] The fact that sacrifices constituted the other essential feature of worship in the Hebrew nation is evident in the passages quoted above — <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1343/bible_king-james-version_exodus_3_18" target=_top>Exodus 3:18</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1343/bible_king-james-version_exodus_5_2-3" target=_top>5:2-3</a>. Consider too that the Egyptians abhorred the Hebrew nation on account of this ritual, as can be seen from the following in Moses:<br />Moses said, "It is not right to do so, because we would be sacrificing what the Egyptians abhor to Jehovah our God. Look, were we to sacrifice what the Egyptians find abhorrent in their eyes, wouldn't they stone us?" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1343/bible_king-james-version_exodus_8_26" target=_top>Exodus 8:26</a>)<br />So the Egyptians loathed the Hebrew nation, and loathed it so much that they also refused to eat bread with Hebrews (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1343/bible_king-james-version_genesis_43_32" target=_top>Genesis 43:32</a>). This too shows that Jacob's descendants included not only the Hebrew nation but all nations that practiced this type of worship. That is also why the land of Canaan was called the land of the Hebrews in Joseph's time:<br />Joseph said, "I was stolen from the land of the Hebrews." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1343/bible_king-james-version_genesis_40_15" target=_top>Genesis 40:15</a>)<br />[6] Much evidence indicates that sacrifice existed among idolaters in the land of Canaan, since people there sacrificed to their own gods — baals and others. In addition, consider Balaam, who was from Syria, where Eber lived, or in other words, where the Hebrew nation came from before Jacob's descendants entered into the land of Canaan. Balaam not only offered sacrifices but also called his God Jehovah. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1343/bible_king-james-version_numbers_23_7" target=_top>Numbers 23:7</a> shows that Balaam was from Syria, where the Hebrew nation originated.{*3} <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1343/bible_king-james-version_numbers_22_39-40" target=_top>Numbers 22:39-40</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1343/bible_king-james-version_numbers_23_1-2" target=_top>23:1-2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1343/bible_king-james-version_numbers_23_3" target=_top>3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1343/bible_king-james-version_numbers_23_14" target=_top>14</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1343/bible_king-james-version_numbers_23_29" target=_top>29</a> show that he offered sacrifices. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1343/bible_king-james-version_numbers_22_1-41" target=_top>Numbers 22</a>, verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1343/bible_king-james-version_genesis_11_18" target=_top>18</a> and other verses there show that he called his God Jehovah.)<br /><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1343/bible_king-james-version_genesis_8_20" target=_top>Genesis 8:20</a> says that Noah offered burnt offerings to Jehovah, yet this is not a true but rather a made-up story, because burnt offerings symbolized the holiness of worship; see the sections where that verse is discussed [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1343/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_919" target=_top>919-923</a>].<br />These remarks now demonstrate what Eber — that is, the Hebrew nation — symbolizes.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The Scripture quotations that follow in this section contain several references to the Hebrew nation.

That "Eber" was a nation called, from Eber as its father, the Hebrew nation, and that thereby is signified the worship in general of the Second Ancient Church, is evident from those historical parts 
of the Word wherein it is spoken of. From that nation, because the new worship commenced there, all were called Hebrews who had a similar worship. Their worship was of the kind that was afterwards restored 
among the descendants of Jacob; and its chief characteristic consisted in their calling their God "Jehovah," and in their having sacrifices. The Most Ancient Church with unanimity acknowledged the 
Lord, and called Him Jehovah, as is evident from the first chapters of Genesis, and elsewhere in the Word. The Ancient Church, that is, the church after the flood, also acknowledged the Lord, and called 
Him Jehovah, especially those who had internal worship, and were called "sons of Shem." The others, who were in external worship, also acknowledged Jehovah, and worshiped Him. But when internal 
worship became external, and still more when it became idolatrous, and when each nation began to have its own god whom it worshiped, the Hebrew nation retained the name Jehovah, and called their God Jehovah; 
and hereby were distinguished from the other nations.  [2] Together with their external worship, the descendants of Jacob in Egypt lost this also-that they called their God Jehovah; nay, Moses 
himself did so; and therefore they were instructed first of all that Jehovah was the God of the Hebrews, and the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob; as may be seen from these words in Moses: </p>
<p>  
   Jehovah said unto Moses, Thou shalt come in, thou and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, Jehovah the God of the Hebrews hath met with us; and now let us go, we pray 
thee, a three days' journey into the wilderness, and we will sacrifice to Jehovah our God (Exod. 3:18). Again: </p>
<p>     Pharaoh said, Who is Jehovah, that I should hearken unto His voice to let Israel 
go? I know not Jehovah, and moreover I will not let Israel go. And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us; let us go, we pray thee, a three days' journey into the wilderness, and we will 
sacrifice to Jehovah our God (Exod. 5:2-3). [3] That together with the worship the descendants of Jacob in Egypt lost also the name of Jehovah, may be seen from these words in Moses: </p>
<p>     Moses said 
unto God, Behold, when I come unto the sons of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you, and they shall say to me, What is His name? what shall I say unto them? 
And God said unto Moses, I AM WHO I AM. And He said, Thus shalt thou say unto the sons of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the sons of Israel, 
Jehovah the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you this is My name to eternity (Exod. 3:13-15). [4] From these words it is evident 
that even Moses did not know Jehovah; and that they were distinguished from others by the name of Jehovah the God of the Hebrews. Hence in other places also Jehovah is called the God of the Hebrews: </p>
<p> 
    Thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Jehovah the God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee (Exod. 7:16).      Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith Jehovah the God of the Hebrews (Exod. 9:1, 13).  
    And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah the God of the Hebrews (Exod. 10:3). And in Jonah: </p>
<p>     I am a Hebrew; and I fear Jehovah the God of the heavens 
(Jonah 1:9). And also in Samuel: </p>
<p>     The Philistines heard the voice of the shouting, and said, What meaneth the voice of this great shouting in the camp of the Hebrews? And they knew that the 
ark of Jehovah was come into the camp. And the Philistines said, Woe unto us! Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these august gods? These are the gods that smote the Egyptians with all manner of 
plagues in the wilderness. Be like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews (1 Sam. 4:6, 8-9). Here also it is evident that the nations were distinguished by the gods on whose 
name they called, and the Hebrew nation by Jehovah.  [5] That the second essential of the worship of the Hebrew nation consisted in sacrifices, is also evident from passages cited above (Exod. 3:18, 
5:2, 3); as well as from the fact that the Egyptians abominated the Hebrew nation on account of this worship, as is evident from these words in Moses: </p>
<p>     Moses said, It is not right so to do, for we 
shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Jehovah our God; lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us? (Exod. 8:26). For this reason 
the Egyptians so abominated the Hebrew nation that they would not eat bread with them (Gen. 43:32). It is also evident from all this that the posterity of Jacob was not the only Hebrew nation, but 
all who had such worship; and therefore in Joseph's time the land of Canaan was called the land of the Hebrews: </p>
<p>     Joseph said, I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews (Gen. 40:15). [6] 
That there were sacrifices among the idolaters in the land of Canaan, may be seen from many passages, for they sacrificed to their gods-to the Baals and others; and moreover Balaam, who was from Syria 
where Eber dwelt and whence the Hebrew nation came, not only offered sacrifices before the descendants of Jacob came into the land of Canaan, but also called Jehovah his God. That Balaam was from Syria, 
whence came the Hebrew nation, see Numbers 23:7; that he offered sacrifices, 22:39-40; 23:1-3, 14, 29; that he called Jehovah his God, 22:18, and throughout the chapter. What is said of Noah (Gen. 
8:20), that he offered burnt-offerings to Jehovah, is not true history, but is history so made up, because by burnt-offerings there is signified the holy of worship, as may there be seen. From all this 
it is now evident what is signified by "Ber," or by the Hebrew nation. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1343</b></p><p><b>1343.</b>
That 'Eber' was a nation, the Hebrew nation, which took its name from 'Eber' as its forefather, and which means the worship in general of the second Ancient Church, is clear from the references to him 
in the historical sections of the Word. Because a new form of worship began with that nation, all those were called Hebrews whose worship was similar to it. Their worship was like that re-established 
at a later time among the descendants of Jacob, its chief features being that they called their God Jehovah and held sacrifices. The Most Ancient Church was of one mind in acknowledging the Lord and 
calling Him Jehovah, as is clear also from the early chapters of Genesis and elsewhere in the Word. The Ancient Church, that is, the Church after the Flood also acknowledged the Lord and called Him Jehovah, 
especially those who possessed internal worship and were called 'the sons of Shem'. The remainder whose worship was external also acknowledged Jehovah and worshipped Him. But when internal worship 
became external, and still more when it became idolatrous, and when each nation started to have its own god to worship, the Hebrew nation retained the name of Jehovah and called their own God Jehovah. 
In this they were different from all other nations </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Along with external worship, Jacob's descendants in Egypt, including Moses himself, lost knowledge even of this fact, that their God was 
called Jehovah Consequently they had first of all to be taught that Jehovah was the God of the Hebrews, and the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as becomes clear from the following in Moses, </p>
<p>Jehovah 
said to Moses, You and the elders of Israel shall go in to the king of Egypt, and you shall say to him, Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has met with us; and now let us go, pray, a three days' journey 
into the wilderness, and let us sacrifice to Jehovah our God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%203:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 3:18</a>. </p>
<p>In the same author, </p>
<p>Pharaoh said, Who is Jehovah that I should hearken to His voice to send Israel away? I do not know 
Jehovah, and moreover I will not send Israel away And they said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us; let us go, pray, a three days' journey into the wilderness, and let us sacrifice to Jehovah our 
God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%205:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 5:2, 3</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The fact that Jacob's descendants lost in Egypt, along with the worship, even the name of Jehovah becomes clear from the following in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Moses said to God, Behold, 
when I come to the children of Israel and say to them, The God of your fathers has sent me to you, and they say to me, What is His name? What shall I tell them? And God said to Moses, I Am Who I Am. And 
He said, Thus shall you say to the children of Israel, I Am has sent me to you. And God said moreover to Moses, Thus shall you say to the children of Israel, Jehovah the God of your fathers, the God 
of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you; this is My name for ever. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%203:13-15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 3:13-15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 From this it is evident that even Moses did not know it and that they were distinguished 
from everyone else by the name of Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews. Hence also Jehovah is elsewhere called the God of the Hebrews, </p>
<blockquote>
You shall say to Pharaoh, Jehovah the God of the Hebrews 
has sent me to you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%207:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 7:16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Go in to Pharaoh and say to him, Thus said Jehovah the God of the Hebrews. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%209:1,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 9:1, 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh and said to him, Thus said Jehovah the 
God of the Hebrews <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2010:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 10:3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Jonah, </p>
<blockquote>
I am a Hebrew, and I fear Jehovah, the God of heaven. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jonah%201:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jonah 1:9</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And also in Samuel, </p>
<blockquote>
The Philistines heard the noise of the shouting and said, 
What does the noise of this great shouting in the camp of the Hebrews mean? And they learned that the Ark of Jehovah had come to the camp. The Philistines said, Woe to us! Who will deliver us from the 
hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who smote the Egyptians with every sort of plague in the wilderness. Acquit yourselves like men, O Philistines, lest you be slaves to the Hebrews. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1%20Sam%204:6,%208,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">1 Sam 4:6, 8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here also it is evident that nations were distinguished from one another by the gods whose names they called on, and that the Hebrew nation was distinguished by that of Jehovah. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 The 
fact that sacrifices were the second essential feature of the worship of the Hebrew nation is also evident from the words from <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%203:18;%205:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 3:18; 5:2, 3</a>, quoted above, as well as from the fact that the Egyptians 
abhorred the Hebrew nation on account of this form of worship, as is clear from the following in Moses, </p>
<p>Moses said, It is not right to do so, for we would be sacrificing to Jehovah our God what 
is abhorrent to the Egyptians; behold, we would be sacrificing what is abhorrent to the Egyptians in their eyes; will they not stone us? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%208:26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 8:26</a>. </p>
<p>Consequently the Egyptians also abhorred the 
Hebrew nation so much that they refused even 'to eat breed' with them, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2043:32&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 43:32</a>. From this it is also evident that not merely the descendants of Jacob constituted the Hebrew nation but everybody who 
possessed that kind of worship. This also was why in Joseph's day the land of Canaan was called the land of the Hebrews, </p>
<blockquote>
Joseph said. By theft I have been taken away out of the land of the Hebrews. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2040:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 40:15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 The fact that sacrifices took place among the idolaters in the land of Canaan becomes clear from many references, for they used to sacrifice to their gods - to the baals and to others 
What is more, Balaam, who came from Syria where Eber had lived, that is, where the Hebrew nation had originated, before Jacob's descendants entered the land of Canaan, not only offered sacrifices 
but also called his God Jehovah. As to the fact that Balaam came from Syria where the Hebrew nation had originated, see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2023:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 23:7</a>; that he offered sacrifices, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2022:39,%2040;%2023:1-3,%2014,%2029&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 22:39, 40; 23:1-3, 14, 29</a>; that he 
called his God Jehovah, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2022:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 22:18</a>, and elsewhere in those chapters. And <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%208:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 8:20</a> speaks of Noah offering burnt offerings to Jehovah - though this is not true history but made-up history - for 'burnt 
offerings' means the holiness of worship, as may be seen in that story. These considerations now show what 'Eber' or 'the Hebrew nation' means. </p>

Quod 'Eberus' fuerit gens, quae gens Hebraea ut a suo patre nominata, et quod per eam significetur Ecclesiae secundae Antiquae cultus in genere, constat a Verbi historicis ubi passim nominatur; ex illa 
gente quia ibi cultus novus incohatus, omnes vocati sunt Hebraei qui similem cultum habuerunt:  cultus eorum fuit qualis postea restauratus apud Jacobi posteros; et ejus praecipuum constabat in eo 
quod Deum suum appellaverint Jehovam et quod sacrificia habuerint.  Antiquissima Ecclesia unanimiter agnovit Dominum, et Ipsum Jehovam nominavit, ut constat quoque a primis capitibus Geneseos et alibi 
in Verbo:  Antiqua Ecclesia, hoc est, illa quae fuit post diluvium, etiam agnovit Dominum, et Ipsum appellavit Jehovam, illi imprimis qui internum cultum habuerunt et dicti sunt 'filii Shemi'; ceteri 
qui in externo cultu fuerunt, agnoverunt quoque Jehovam, et Ipsum coluerunt; sed cum cultus internus factus est externus, et magis cum idololatricus, et cum unaquaevis gens habere coepit suum deum quem 
coluit, gens Hebraea retinuit nomen Jehovae, et appellavit Deum suum Jehovam, et in hoc distinguebantur a ceteris gentibus:  [2] Jacobi posteri in Aegypto, cum cultu externo, etiam perdiderunt hoc 
quod Deus eorum appellaretur Jehovah, immo ipse Moses; quare instructi sunt omnium primum quod Jehovah esset Deus Hebraeorum, et Deus Abrahami, Isaci et Jacobi, ut constare potest ab his apud Mosen, Jehovah 
dixit ad Mosen, Intrabis tu et seniores Israelis ad regem Aegypti, et dicetis ad eum, Jehovah Deus Hebraeorum obviam venit nobis; et nunc eamus, quaeso, iter trium dierum in desertum, et sacrificemus 
Jehovae Deo nostro, Exod. iii 18: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Dixit Pharaoh, Quis Jehovah, cujus audiam vocem, ad dimittendum Israelem?  non novi Jehovam, etiamque Israelem non dimittam; et dixerunt, Deus 
Hebraeorum obviam venit nobis; eamus, quaeso, iter trium dierum in desertum, et sacrificemus Jehovae Deo nostro, Exod. v 2, 3. [3] Quod Jacobi posteri perdiderint in Aegypto, cum cultu, etiam nomen 
Jehovae, constare potest ab his apud Mosen, Dixit Moses ad Deum, Ecce ego cum venero ad filios Israelis, et dixero ad illos, Deus patrum vestrorum misit me ad vos, et dixerint mihi, Quodnam nomen illius? 
 quid dicam ad eos?  et dixit Deus ad Mosen, Sum Qui Sum; et dixit, Ita dices filiis Israelis, Sum misit me ad vos; et dixit amplius Deus ad Mosen, Ita dices ad filios Israelis, Jehovah Deus patrum 
vestrorum, Deus Abrahami, Deus Isaci, et Deus Jacobi, misit me ad vos; hoc Nomen Meum in aeternum, Exod. iii 13-15; </p>
<p>[4] inde patet quod etiam Moses nesciverit, et quod distinguerentur a ceteris per 
nomen Jehovae Dei Hebraeorum; inde etiam alibi Jehovah nominatur Deus Hebraeorum, Dices ad Pharaonem, Jehovah Deus Hebraeorum misit me ad te, Exod. vii 16: </p>
<p>Intra ad Pharaonem, et loquere ad eum, Sic 
dixit Jehovah Deus Hebraeorum, Exod. ix 1, 13: </p>
<p>Intravit Moses et Aharon ad Pharaonem, et dixerunt ad eum, Ita dixit Jehovah Deus Hebraeorum, Exod. x 3: </p>
<p>apud Jonam, Hebraeus ego, et Jehovam Deum 
caelorum ego timens, i 9: </p>
<p>tum quoque apud Samuelem, Audiverunt Philistaei vocem acclamationis, dixerunt, Quae vox acclamationis magnae hujus in castris Hebraeorum?  et cognoverunt quod arca Jehovae 
venisset ad castra; Philistaei... dixerunt,... Vae nobis, quis liberabit nos e manu Deorum magnificorum horum?  hi illi dii, qui percusserunt Aegyptios omni plaga in deserto; estote in viros, Philistaei,... 
ne serviatis Hebraeis, 1 Sam. iv 6, 8, 9; </p>
<p>ibi quoque patet quod gentes distinguerentur per deos quos nominarent et quod gens Hebraea per Jehovam.  [5] Quod alterum essentiale cultus gentis Hebraea 
constituerint sacrificia, patet quoque a locis supra adductis Exod. iii 18; v, 2, 3; tum ex eo quod Aegyptii abominati sint gentem Hebraeam propter hunc cultum, ut constat ex his apud Mosen, Dixit 
Moses, Non rectum ad faciendum sic, quia abominationem Aegyptiorum sacrificaremus Jehovae Deo nostro; ecce sacrificaremus abominationem Aegyptiorum in oculis eorum, nonne lapidabunt nos?  Exod. viii 
22 [A.V. 26]; </p>
<p>quare etiam Aegyptii abominati sunt gentem Hebraeam, usque adeo ut nec cum iis comedere panem vellent, Gen. xliii 32; inde quoque patet quod posteritas Jacobi non sola fuerit gens Hebraea, 
sed omnes qui talem cultum habuerunt, quare etiam terra Canaan vocatur terra Hebraeorum tempore Josephi, Josephus dixit, Furto ablatus sum e terra Hebraeorum, Gen. xl 15. [6] Quod sacrificia apud 
idololatras in terra Canaane fuerint, multis constare potest; sacrificabant enim suis diis, Baalibus et aliis; praeter quod Bileamus, qui fuit e Syria ubi Eberus, seu unde gens Hebraea antequam posteri 
Jacobi venerunt in terram Canaanem, non modo sacrificia obtulit, sed etiam Jehovam Deum suum vocavit; quod 'Bileamus e Syria, unde gens Hebraea,' Num. xxiii 7; quod 'sacrificia obtulit,' Num. xxii 
39, 40; xxiii 1-3, 14, 29; quod 'Jehovam Deum suum vocavit,' Num. xxii 18, et passim ibi.  Quod de Noaho, cap. viii vers. 20, dicatur quod obtulerit holocausta Jehovae, non est historicum verum, sed 
historicum factum, quia per 'holocausta' significatum sanctum cultus, ut ibi videatur.  Ex his nunc patet quid per '(x)Eberum' seu per 'gentem Hebraeam' significetur. </p>
