Verses 4, 5. When a man shall desolate a field, or a vineyard, and shall let his beast go in, and it shall desolate in the field of another; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, 
he shall repay. When a fire shall go forth, and shall catch hold of thorns, and a stack is consumed, or the standing crop, or a field; he that kindleth the fire, repaying shall repay. "When a 
man shall desolate a field, or a vineyard" signifies the deprivation of the good and the truth of the church through cupidities; "and shall let his beast go in," signifies if he does this with but little 
knowledge; "and it shall desolate in the field of another," signifies the consuming of the cohering goods; "of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, he shall repay," signifies 
restoration from goods and truths still unimpaired; "when a fire shall go forth," signifies anger from the affection of evil; "and shall catch hold of thorns," signifies which betakes itself into 
falsities; "and a stack is consumed," signifies injury to the goods and truths of faith that have been received; "or the standing crop, or a field," signifies also to the goods and truths of faith 
in their conception; "he that kindleth the fire repaying shall repay," signifies the restoration of what was taken away through anger from the affection of evil. </p>

Verses 5, 6 When a man devastates a field or a vineyard, sending in his beast of burden and causing devastation<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> in another's field, he shall make repayment from the best of his own field or from the 
best of his own vineyard. When fire breaks out and catches hold of thorns, and a stack of grain is consumed, or standing grain, or a field, the one kindling what is kindled shall surely make repayment. 
 </p>
<p>'When a man devastates a field or a vineyard' means a stripping away of the Church's goodness and truth by evil desires. 'Sending in his beast of burden' means if he does it with little self-awareness. 
'And causing devastation in another's field' means consuming interconnected forms of good. 'He shall make repayment from the best of his own field or from the best of his own vineyard' means 
undertaking restoration with forms of good and with truths that are still intact. 'When fire breaks out' means anger arising from an affection for evil. 'And catches hold of thorns' means which spreads 
into falsities. 'And a stack of grain is consumed' means harm done to accepted truths and forms of the good of faith. 'Or standing grain, or a field' means or to truths and forms of the good of faith 
in the process of being conceived. 'The one kindling what is kindled shall surely make repayment' means undertaking restoration for the things taken away by the anger arising from an affection for evil.
