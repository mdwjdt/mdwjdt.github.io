<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5034节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5034.</strong>“他的怒气就发作了”表对属灵真理的憎恶。这从“怒气”的含义清楚可知，“怒气”是指违背仁之良善（<a href="357.htm">357</a>节），因而是指憎恶，在此是指对属灵真理的憎恶，因为该真理是此处所论述的主题。“怒气”之所以表示憎恶，是因为只要人向别人发怒，他就会对这个人感到厌恶；事实上，当有人或有事物冒犯人藉以与某人或某个具体事物联结的爱时，怒气就会发作或激起。当这种联结被打破时，此人就会发怒或怒不可遏，仿佛他生命中某种赋予他快乐的东西，因而其生命的某种东西丧失了。这种难过会转变为悲伤，而悲伤则转变为愤怒。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5034</b></p><p><b>5034.</b>
That his anger was kindled. That this signifies aversion to spiritual truth, is evident from the signification of "anger," as being a receding from the good of charity (n. 357), thus aversion, and here 
aversion to spiritual truth, because this is the subject treated of. That "anger" denotes aversion, is because so long as a man is in anger against anyone, he averts his mind from him; for anger exists 
or is excited when anyone or anything is contrary to one's love, by which there is conjunction with anyone or anything. When this conjunction is broken, the man becomes angry or wrathful, as if something 
were lost from the delight of his life, and consequently from his life. This sadness is turned into grief, and the grief into anger. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5034</b></p><p><b>5034.</b>
That his anger flared up' means an aversion to spiritual truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'anger' as a departure from the good of charity, dealt with in <a href="357.htm">357</a>, and so an aversion, in this case 
an aversion to spiritual truth since that truth is the subject here. The reason 'anger' means an aversion is that as long as a person is angry with another he feels averse to him; for anger arises or 
is aroused in someone when the love linking him to some other person, or to some particular object, is offended by that person or object. When the link is broken, that person flares up or becomes angry, 
as though something in his life that gives him delight, and thus something of his own life, has been lost. This sorrow turns into grief, and the grief into anger. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 5034</b>
</p><b>5034.</b>
`Et accensa ira illius': quod significet aversionem a vero spirituali, constat ex significatione `irae' quod sit recessio a bono charitatis, de qua n. 357, ita aversio, hic a vero spirituali quia 
de hoc agitur; quod `ira' sit aversio, est quia homo quamdiu est in ira contra aliquem, avertat animum ab illo; ira enim existit seu excitatur cum aliquis seu aliquid contrariatur alicujus amori, per 
quem conjunctio est cum aliquo seu cum aliqua re; cum conjunctio illa rumpitur, tunc excandescit seu irascitur homo, sicut aliquid ex suae vitae jucundo, proinde aliquid ex sua vita amissum sit, 
hoc triste vertitur in dolorem et dolor in iram. </p>
