<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1543.</strong>“亚伯兰从埃及上来”表远离那些离开主的记忆知识。这从“亚伯兰”、“埃及”、“上来”的含义清楚可知：“亚伯兰”代表主；“埃及”表知识；“当从低级事物上升到高级事物时，就会用“上来”这样的表述，因此，“从埃及上来到迦南地”这句话经常出现在圣言中，它就包含类似观念。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1543.</strong> Abram went up from Egypt means that the Lord rose above facts, which took leave of him, as can be seen from the symbolism of Abram, in that he represents the Lord. It is also established by the symbolism of Egypt as factual knowledge, and by the symbolism of going up. "Going up" is the expression used when one rises up out of lower things (facts) toward higher things (heavenly qualities). So in the Word, going up from Egypt into the land of Canaan 钬?an activity mentioned frequently 钬?involves the same idea. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1543</b></p><p><b>1543.</b>
And Abram went up out of Egypt. That this signifies from memory-knowledges, which left the Lord, is evident from the signification of "Abram," as representing the Lord; and also from the signification 
of "Egypt," which is memory-knowledge; and also from the signification of "going up," for this expression is used of emerging from the lower things, which are the memory-knowledges, to the higher, which 
are the celestial things; and therefore, in the Word, "to go up from Egypt into the land of Canaan"-an expression which often occurs-involves the like things. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1543</b></p><p><b>1543.</b>
That 'Abram went up out of Egypt' means away from facts which went away from the Lord is clear from the meaning of 'Abram' as one who represents the Lord, then from the meaning of 'Egypt' as knowledge, 
and also from the meaning of 'going up', for 'going up' is used when a rising up takes place from the lower things that are factual to the higher ones that are celestial. Consequently in the Word 'going 
up from Egypt into the land of Canaan', an expression that occurs frequently, embodies similar ideas. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1543</b>
</p><b>1543.</b>
Quod 'ascendit Abram ex Aegypto' significet quod a scientificis quae Dominum reliquerunt, constat a significatione 'Abrami' quod per illum repraesentetur Dominus; tum a significatione 'Aegypti' quod 
sit scientia; etiam a significatione 'ascendere,' nam ascendere praedicatur, cum ab inferioribus quae sunt scientifica, emergit ad superiora quae sunt caelestia, quare in Verbo 'ascendere ab Aegypto 
in terram Canaan,' quod saepe occurrit, similia involvit. </p>
