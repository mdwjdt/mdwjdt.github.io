<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4829.</strong>“犹大娶妻”表为他的后代所建的教会。这从他玛的代表清楚可知，他玛，就是此处的“妻”，是指教会，如下文所述。犹大为长子珥娶她，好叫珥由此拥有后代，就表示这个教会是为犹大的后代而建的。</p>

And Judah took a woman. That this signifies the church which was for his posterity, is evident from the representation of Tamar, who is the "woman" here, as being the church, of which in what follows. 
That it was for the posterity of Judah, is signified by his taking her for Er his first-born, that he might have descendants thence. </p>

'Judah took a wife' means the Church which was for his descendants. This is clear from the representation of Tamar, to whom 'e wife' refers here, as the Church, dealt with below. Its being for his descendants 
is meant by the fact that he took her for Er his firstborn, so as to have descendants from them. </p>

`Accepit Jehudah mulierem': quod significet Ecclesiam quae posteritati ejus, constat ex repraesentatione `Tamaris' quae hic `mulier', quod sit Ecclesia, de qua in sequentibus; quod posteritati Jehudae, 
significatur per quod acceperit illam Ero primogenito suo ut inde ei posteri {1}.      @1 posteri illi$ </p>
