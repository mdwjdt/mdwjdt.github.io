<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5256节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5256.</strong>“说，这不在乎我”表它并非只来源于人。这从“不在乎我”的含义清楚可知。“不在乎我”，或不属于他，当论及“约瑟”所代表的主时，是指它并非只来源于人，而是来源于神性；因为神性预见、因而知道某个事物里面包含的东西。主在世时的确拥有预见和提供；这二者虽存在于人身里面，却来源于神性。但自祂得了荣耀之后，这些只来源于神性，因为这得了荣耀的人身就是神性。就其本身而言，这人身无非是从神性接受生命的一个形式；而主荣耀了的人身，或祂的神性人身，并非从神性接受生命的一个形式，而是那生命的实际内在存在；由此发出之物就是生命。这就是天使们对主所持的观念；但如今基督教会成员进入来世后，思想主时几乎都如同思想其他人，或说对主的概念如同对其他人的概念。他们不仅认为主与神性分离，尽管他们的确将神性归于祂；还认为祂与耶和华分离。此外，他们还认为主与从祂发出的那圣者是分离的。诚然，他们也说“一神”，但却思想三；并实际上将神性分为三。因为他们将神性划分为独立的位格，称每个位格为神，并将一个明晰的权属归于每个位格。因此，在来世，据说基督徒拜三位神，因为他们思想三位，无论他们如何谈论一位。<br />但那些曾是外邦人，并皈依基督教的人在来世只崇拜主；这是因为他们认为，这不可能是别的人，只能是那在世上将自己显为一个人的至高神，这至高神就是一个神性人。他们还认为，他们若没有对至高神的这种观念，就根本不可能有任何观念，因而不能思想神，进而不能认识祂，更不可能爱祂。</p>

Saying, Not unto me. That this signifies that it was not from the human alone, is evident from the signification of "not unto me," or not belonging to him, when said of the Lord, who is represented by 
Joseph, as being not to be from the human alone, but from the Divine; for the Divine foresees, consequently knows what is therein. For when the Lord was in the world He indeed had foresight and providence 
in the human, but from the Divine; but since His glorification these are from the Divine alone; for the Human glorified is the Divine. Regarded in itself the human is nothing but a form receptive 
of life from the Divine; but the Lord's glorified Human, or His Divine Human, is not a form recipient of life from the Divine, but is the very being of life; and that which proceeds therefrom is life. 
Such is the idea that the angels have in regard to the Lord; but they who at this day come from the Christian Church into the other life have nearly all an idea of the Lord as being like any other 
man, not only separate from the Divine (though indeed they adjoin what is Divine to Him), but also separate from Jehovah, and what is more, separate even from the holy that proceeds from Him. They do 
indeed say "one God," but still they think of three; and they actually divide the Divine among three; for they distinguish it into persons, calling each God, and attribute to each a distinct property. 
Consequently it is said of Christians in the other life that they worship three gods, because they think of three, however much they may say one. But they who have been Gentiles and have been converted 
to Christianity, in the other life adore the Lord alone; and this for the reason that they have believed that it could not but be that the Supreme God has manifested Himself on earth as a man, and 
that the Supreme God is a Divine man; and that if they had not this idea of the Supreme God they could have none at all, and so could not think about God, consequently could not know Him, still less 
love Him. </p>

'Saying, It is not mine' means that it does not have a purely human origin. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'it is not mine' or not belonging to himself - when these words refer to the Lord, who 
is represented by 'Joseph' - as that it does not have a purely human origin but a Divine one; for the Divine foresees and consequently knows what something holds within it. When He was in the world 
the Lord possessed foresight and providence; the two were indeed present in the human, but they had their origin in the Divine. After that time however, once He was glorified, they had their origin in 
the Divine alone, for the Human, having been glorified, is Divine. Regarded in itself the human is nothing else than a form that receives life from the Divine; but the Lord's glorified Human, or His 
Divine Human, is not a form that receives life from the Divine but is the actual inner Being (Esse) of that life and so the source from which it comes forth. This is the kind of idea about the Lord that 
angels have. But as for members of the Christian Church at the present day who enter the next life, almost all think of the Lord as they do of any other human being. Not only do they have an idea 
of Him separate from the Divine, though they do attribute Divinity to Him; they also have an idea of Him separate from Jehovah. In addition they have an idea of Him separate from the holy one that goes 
forth from Him. They talk, it is true, about one God, yet they think of three and in practice divide the Divine into three. For they distinguish the Divine into separate persons, calling each one God 
and attributing a distinct property to each. Consequently Christians are said in the next life to worship three Gods, for their thoughts are of three however much they may talk about one. </p>

 But 
those who are gentile converts to Christianity worship the Lord alone in the next life. They do so because they believed that it could have been none else than the supreme Deity who revealed Himself 
on earth as man and that this supreme Deity is a Divine Man. They also believed that if they did not have that idea of the supreme Deity they could not have any idea at all and so could not have any thought 
about God, nor consequently have any knowledge of Him, let alone love for Him. </p>

`Dicendo, Non ad me': quod significet quod non ex humano solo, constare potest ex significatione `non ad me', seu non pertinens ad se, cum agitur de Domino, Qui repraesentatur per Josephum, quod sit 
non ex humano solo sed ex Divino, nam Divinum praevidet, proinde novit quid inest; Domino enim (t)praevidentia et providentia fuit cum in mundo, {1}quidem in humano, sed ex Divino; at dein cum glorificatus, 
est ex solo Divino, nam humanum glorificatum est Divinum; humanum in se spectatum non est nisi quam forma recipiens vitae a Divino, at Humanum glorificatum Domini, seu Divinum Humanum Ipsius, 
non est forma recipiens vitae a Divino sed est Ipsum Esse vitae, et quod inde procedit, est vita; talem ideam de Domino habent angeli; at qui ab Ecclesia Christiana hodie in alteram vitam veniunt, paene 
omnes ideam de Domino sicut de alio homine habent, non modo separatam a Divino, tametsi Ipsi Divinum quoque adjungunt, sed etiam separatam a Jehovah, et quod magis, separatam etiam a sancto quod procedit 
ab Ipso; unum quidem Deum dicunt sed usque cogitant tres, et actualiter Divinum inter tres partiuntur; distinguunt enim in personas, et quamlibet Deum vocant, {2}et cuique proprium distinctum 
tribuunt; inde de Christianis dicitur in altera vita quod tres Deos colant, quia tres cogitant utcumque unum dicunt. [2] Qui autem gentiles fuerunt et conversi ad Christianismum, illi in altera vita Dominum 
solum adorant, et hoc ex causa quia crediderunt quod non potuerit aliud esse quam quod supremus Deus se manifestaverit in terra sicut homo, et quod supremus Deus sit Divinus Homo; et si de supremo 
Deo non illam ideam haberent quod nullam possent habere, sic nec cogitare de Deo, consequenter non cognoscere Illum, minus amare Illum.  @1 non ex$ @2 cui$ </p>
