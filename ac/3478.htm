<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3478.</strong>帐幕和约柜也展现在一些灵人面前。因为他们在世时就以圣言为大乐，这类事物便活生生地呈现给他们。这就是帐幕及其所属一切，它的院子、四围的帘子、里面的幔子、金坛或香坛、陈设饼的桌子、灯台，以及上有基路伯的施恩座的情形。同时，这些正直的灵人得以感知到每个具体事物表示什么：帐幕代表三层天堂，上有施恩座的法柜里面的石版代表主自己。随着他们的视觉被打开，他们在这些物体中看到越来越属天和神性的事物，都是他们在世时根本就不知道的。说来奇妙，那里的每一个最小事物，哪怕每个钩、环，无不是代表。<br />例如桌子上的饼。他们在饼中如在一个代表和符号中那样感知到天使赖以存活的食物，从而感知到属天和属灵之爱，以及天使所享受的一切幸福快乐。他们从这些爱和幸福快乐中感知到主自己就是那天上的饼或吗哪。此外，他们从饼的形状、位置和数量，以及它们周围的金子，照亮这些事物并进一步展示无法形容之物的代表的灯台中感知到更多细节。帐幕的其它事物也一样。由此可见，犹太教会的一切宗教仪式或代表包含了基督教会的一切奥秘；并且旧约的代表和有意义的符号被揭示给的那些人在世期间就能知道并发觉属于主在地上国度的奥秘。等到了来世，他们就能知道并发觉属于主在天上国度的奥秘中的奥秘。</p>

There was also represented before certain spirits the tabernacle with the ark; for they who during their abode in the world have been greatly delighted with the Word, have such things actually presented 
to view. Such was the case with the tabernacle, together with all its appurtenances, its courts, its curtains round about, its veils within, the golden altar, or altar of incense, the table with the 
loaves upon it, the lampstand, the mercy-seat with the cherubim. At the same time it was given to the well-disposed spirits to perceive what each thing signified: that the three heavens were represented 
by the tabernacle, and the Lord Himself by the Testimony in the ark on which was the mercy-seat; and in proportion as their sight was opened, they saw therein things more and more heavenly and Divine, 
of which they had no knowledge in the life of the body; and wonderful to say there was not the smallest thing there that was not representative, even to the hooks and rings. [2] For instance, 
the bread that was on the table-in this as in a representative and symbol they perceived that food by which angels live, thus celestial and spiritual love together with their joys and felicities; and 
in these loves and joys they perceived the Lord Himself, as the bread or manna from heaven; besides many particulars from the form, position, and number of the loaves; and from the gold encompassing the 
table, and from the lampstand, by which these things when illuminated exhibited still further representations of things unspeakable; and the same with everything else; from all which it might also 
appear that the rituals or representatives of the Jewish Church contained within them all the arcana of the Christian Church; and likewise that they to whom the representatives and significatives of the 
Word of the Old Testament are opened may know and perceive the arcana of the Lord's Church on earth while they live in the world; and the arcana of arcana which are in the Lord's kingdom in the heavens 
when they come into the other life. </p>

To some there was also represented the tabernacle with the ark, for to those who, when they lived in the world, have taken very great delight in the Word such things are presented to them visually. So 
on the occasion referred to they saw the tabernacle with all its furnishings; that is to say, they saw its courts, its curtains round about, its veils inside, the golden altar or altar of incense, the 
table where the loaves were placed, the lampstand, and the mercy-seat with the cherubim. At the same time these upright spirits were allowed to perceive what each particular thing meant. It was the 
three heavens that were represented by the tabernacle, and the Lord Himself by the testimony inside the ark, above which there was the mercy-seat. And to the extent their sight was opened they saw within 
those objects more heavenly and Divine things, of which they had had no knowledge at all during their lifetime. And what was amazing, every least thing there, even every hook or ring, was representative. 
Consider merely the bread placed on the table. Within this as within a representative and symbol they perceived the food on which angels live, and so perceived celestial and spiritual love together 
with all the bliss and happiness that the angels enjoy. And within that love, also that bliss and happiness, they perceived the Lord Himself as the bread or manna from heaven. They perceived more 
besides from the shape, position, and number of the loaves, and from the gold which was around them, and from the lampstand which lit up those things and displayed further representations of things 
that are indescribable. The same was so with everything else in the tabernacle. From all this one might also see that the religious observances or the representatives of the Jewish Church contained all 
the arcana of the Christian Church, and also that those to whom the representatives and meaningful signs of the Old Testament Word are disclosed are able, while living in the world, to know and perceive 
the arcana which belong to the Lord's Church on earth. And when they enter the next life they are able to know and perceive the arcana of arcana which belong to the Lord's kingdom in heaven. </p>

Etiam repraesentabatur coram quibusdam tabernaculum cum arca; qui enim Verbo summopere delectati fuerunt cum vixerunt in mundo, illis talia {1}quoque sistuntur videnda; ita tunc tabernaculum cum omni 
ejus apparatu, nempe cum atriis, aulaeis circum, velis intus, altari aureo seu suffitus, mensa ubi panes, candelabro, propitiatorio cum cherubis; et tunc simul spiritibus probis dabatur percipere quid 
singula significarent; erant tres caeli, qui per tabernaculum repraesentati sunt, et Ipse Dominus per testimonium in arca super qua propitiatorium; et quantum illis aperiebatur visus, tantum in illis 
caelestiora ac Diviniora videbant, quorum nullam cognitionem habuerunt in vita corporis, et quod mirum, non erat minimum ibi quod non esset repraesentativum, usque ad uncos et annulos; ut solum in 
pane qui super mens, in illo ut in repraesentativo et symbolico percipiebant illum victum a quo angeli vivunt, ita amorem caelestem et spiritualem cum eorum faustis et felicibus, ac in illo et in his 
Ipsum Dominum, ut panem seu mannam e caelo, praeter plura ex panum forma, positione, numero, et ex auro quod ibi circum, et ex candelabro e quo illa illuminata adhuc exhibebant repraesentationes rerum* 
ineffabiliarum; ita in reliquis; ex quibus constare quoque potuit quod ritualia seu repraesentativa Ecclesiae Judaicae in se continuerint omnia arcana Ecclesiae Christianae, tum quod illi quibus repraesentativa 
et significativa Verbi Veteris Testamenti aperiuntur, arcana Ecclesiae Domini in terris, cum vivunt in mundo, et arcanorum arcana quae in regno Domini in caelis, cum in alteram vitam veniunt, 
scire et percipere possint. @1 i in altera vita$  </p>
