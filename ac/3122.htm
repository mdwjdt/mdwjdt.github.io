<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3122节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3122.</strong>至于这表示仁爱的真理，情况是这样：属天的上古之人将主的怜悯和真理仅仅理解为对主之爱和由此衍生的对邻之仁的流注的接受；而属灵的古人则将他们所具有的主的怜悯和真理理解为仁与信。这是因为属天之人从不思想那些属于信或真理的事物，只思想那些属于爱或良善的事物。这从前面有关属天之人的论述（<a href="202.htm">202</a>，<a href="337.htm">337</a>，<a href="2669.htm">2669</a>，<a href="2715.htm">2715</a>节）清楚可知。此外，属天之人在经历改造和重生时，是通过对邻之仁被引入对主之爱的。故显而易见，主的怜悯无非表示对主之爱的流注的直觉；而“真理”则表示来自那流入之爱的对邻之仁的流注。<br />属灵之人的情况则不然。这些人思想信的事物，在经历改造和重生时，通过信的事物被引入对邻之仁。所以，当论述的主题是属灵之人时，“主的怜悯”表示对邻之仁的流注，“真理”表示信的流注。不过，一旦属灵之人重生，这信就变成仁。因为此时，他出于仁爱行事，以致凡不出于仁爱行事者，都未重生；凡出于仁爱行事者都已重生。在这种情况下，他毫不关心信或真理的事物，因为他的生命源于信之善，而不再源于信之真。事实上，真理已与良善结合，以致除了作为善所取的形式显现外，它不再显现，也就是说，信可以说只是仁所取的形式。由此可见上古之人和古人如何理解圣言所频繁提及的“怜悯和真理”的。如诗篇：<br />王必永远坐在神面前；愿你预备怜悯和真理保佑他。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗61.7.htm">61:7</a>）<br /><br />怜悯和真理彼此相遇；公义和平安彼此亲吻。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗85.10.htm">85:10</a>）<br /><br />主啊，你是有丰盛的怜悯和真理的神。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗86.15.htm">86:15</a>）<br /><br />我的真理和我的怜悯要与祂同在。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗89.24.htm">89:24</a>）<br /><br />耶和华记念祂向以色列家所发的怜悯和真理。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗98.3.htm">98:3</a>）<br /><br />耶和华啊，荣耀不要归与我们，要因你的怜悯和真理归在你的名下！（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗115.1.htm">115:1</a>）<br />弥迦书：<br />耶和华神必按古时日子起誓应许我们列祖的话，向雅各发真理，向亚伯拉罕施怜悯。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥7.20.htm">7:20</a>）<br />此处“雅各”表主的外在人，“亚伯拉罕”表在人性方面的内在人。何西阿书：<br />耶和华与这地的居民争辩，因这地上无真理，无怜悯，无人认识神。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何4.1.htm">4:1</a>）<br />“无真理”表没有对于仁爱流注的接受，“无怜悯”表没有对于爱之流注的接受，“无人认识神”表没有对信之真理流注的接受。</p>

Moreover in regard to this truth by which is signified charity, the case is this: The most ancient people, who were celestial, by mercy and truth from the Lord understood nothing else than the reception 
of the influx of love to the Lord, and of the derivative charity toward the neighbor. But the ancients, who were spiritual, by the mercy and truth from the Lord with themselves, understood charity 
and faith; the reason of which is, that the celestial never thought concerning those things which are of faith or truth, but concerning those which are of love or good, as may be seen from what has been 
said above concerning the celestial man (n. 202, 337, 2669, 2715). Moreover celestial men when being reformed and regenerated were introduced into love to the Lord through charity toward the neighbor. 
It is evident therefore that by "mercy from the Lord" nothing else is signified than a perception of the influx of love to Him; and by "truth," a derivative influx of charity toward the neighbor. [2] 
But it is otherwise with the spiritual; these think concerning the things of faith; and when being reformed and regenerated they are introduced by means of the things of faith into charity toward 
the neighbor. And therefore when the spiritual are treated of, by "mercy from the Lord" is meant an influx of charity toward the neighbor; and by "truth" is meant an influx of faith. But still this 
faith, when the spiritual man has been regenerated, becomes charity; for he then acts from charity; insomuch that one who does not act from charity is not regenerate, but he who acts from charity is regenerate; 
and in this case he is not solicitous about the things of faith or truth, for he lives from the good of faith, and no longer from its truth; for truth has so conjoined itself with good that 
it no longer appears, except merely as the form of good, that is, faith is not otherwise than as the form of charity.  
[3] From what has been said we can see what the most ancient people, and what the ancients, understood by "mercy and truth," so frequently 
mentioned in the Word. As in David: </p>
<p>     The king shall dwell before God forever; O prepare mercy and truth, that they may preserve him (Ps. 61:7). Again: </p>
<p>     Mercy and truth shall meet together, 
righteousness and peace shall kiss each other (Ps. 85:10). Again: </p>
<p>     Thou O Lord art a God great in mercy and truth (Ps. 86:15). Again: </p>
<p>     My truth and My mercy shall be with Him (Ps. 89:24). Again: </p>
<p> 
    Jehovah hath remembered His mercy and His truth toward the house of Israel (Ps. 98:3). Again: </p>
<p>     O Jehovah, not unto us, but unto Thy name give glory, for Thy mercy and for Thy truth's 
sake (Ps. 115:1). In Micah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah God will give the truth to Jacob, the mercy to Abraham, which Thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old (Micah 7:20); </p>
<p>where "Jacob" denotes 
the Lord's external man, and "Abraham" the internal, as to the Human. In Hosea: </p>
<p>     Jehovah hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, and no mercy, and no knowledge 
of God (Hos. 4:1). "No truth" denotes no reception of the influx of charity; "no mercy," no reception of the influx of love; "no knowledge of God," no reception of the influx of the truth of faith. </p>

With regard to this truth, by which charity is meant, there is more to be said: The most ancient people, who were celestial, understood nothing else by mercy and truth from the Lord than the reception<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> 
of the influx of love to the Lord and from this of charity towards the neighbour; but the ancients, who were spiritual, took mercy and truth present with them from the Lord to mean charity and faith. 
The reason for this was that those who were celestial never thought about the things that are matters of faith or truth but about those that are matters of love or good, as becomes clear from what 
has been stated already about the celestial man in <a href="202.htm">202</a>, <a href="337.htm">337</a>, <a href="2669.htm">2669</a>, <a href="2715.htm">2715</a>. Furthermore it was by means of charity towards the neighbour that celestial people were led into love to the Lord when they were 
being reformed and regenerated. From this it is evident that 'mercy from the Lord' is used to mean nothing else than a perception of the influx of love to Him, and 'truth' to mean the influx of charity 
towards the neighbour from that inflowing love. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 With those who are spiritual however it is different. These do think about the things that are matters of faith, and when they are being reformed 
and regenerated it is by means of the things which are matters of faith that they are led into charity towards the neighbour. Consequently when spiritual people are the subject 'mercy from the Lord' 
is used to mean the influx of charity towards the neighbour, and 'truth' to mean the influx of faith. Nevertheless once the spiritual man has been regenerated this faith becomes charity, for now he 
acts from charity, so much so that anyone among them who does not act from charity is not regenerate, whereas anyone who does act from charity is regenerate. Also, he now has no interest at all in matters 
of faith or truth, for his life springs from the good of faith, and no longer from the truth of faith. Indeed truth has now so joined itself to good that it ceases to be seen except as the form 
which good takes, that is, faith is now nothing else so to speak than the form which charity takes. </p>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 From this one may see what the most ancient people meant, and what the ancients meant, by mercy 
and truth which are mentioned so many times in the Word, as in David, </p>
<blockquote>
The king will dwell for ever before God. Prepare mercy and truth, let them watch over him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2061:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 61:7</a>.

<p>In the same author, </p>
<p>Mercy 
and truth will meet, righteousness and peace will kiss each other. Ps. <a href="85.htm">85</a> <a href="10.htm">10</a>. </p>
<p>In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
The Lord God is great in mercy and truth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2086:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 86:15</a>.

<p>In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
My truth

<p>In the same author, </p>

O Jehovah, not to us, but 
to Your name give glory, for the sake of Your mercy and Your truth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20115:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 115:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Micah, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah God will give truth to Jacob, mercy to Abraham, which You have sworn to our fathers from days 
of old. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Micah%207:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Micah 7:20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'Jacob' stands for the Lord's external man, 'Abraham' for the internal as regards the human. In Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah's controversy with the inhabitants of the land because there 
is no truth, and no mercy, and no knowledge of God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%204:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 4:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'No truth' stands for no reception of the influx of charity, 'no mercy' for no reception of the influx of love, 'no knowledge of God' 
for no reception of the influx of the truth of faith.

Praeterea ita se habet cum veritate hac, per quam significatur charitas; quod antiquissimi qui fuerunt caelestes, per misericordiam et veritatem quae a Domino, non aliud intellexerint quam {1}receptionem 
influxus amoris in Dominum et inde charitatis erga proximum; at antiqui qui fuerunt spirituales, per misericordiam et veritatem a Domino apud se, intellexerunt charitatem et fidem; causa est quia 
caelestes nusquam de illis quae sunt fidei seu veri cogitarunt, sed de illis quae sunt amoris seu boni, ut constare potest ex illis quae prius de caelesti homine, n. 202, 337, 2669, 2715 dicta sunt; 
etiam caelestes homines per charitatem erga proximum, {2}introducebantur in amorem in Dominum cum reformabantur et regenerabantur, inde patet quod per `misericordiam a Domino' non aliud intelligatur 
quam perceptio influxus amoris in Ipsum, et per `veritatem' influxus charitatis erga proximum inde: [2] at spirituales aliter, ii de illis quae sunt fidei cogitant, (c)ac cum reformantur (c)et regenerantur 
per illa quae sunt fidei, introducuntur in charitatem erga proximum; quare cum de illis agitur, per misericordiam a Domino intelligitur influxus charitatis erga proximum, et per veritatem influxus 
fidei; at usque fides haec, cum regeneratus est homo spiritualis, fit charitas, nam tunc a charitate agit, et hoc usque adeo ut qui illorum non a charitate agit, non regeneratus sit, at qui a charitate 
agit, is regeneratus est, et tunc quae fidei seu veri sunt {3}nihil curat, nam ex bono fidei vivit, non amplius ex vero ejus, verum enim se ita conjunxit bono ut non amplius appareat, nisi modo sicut 
forma boni, hoc est, fides non aliter quam sicut forma charitatis: [3] inde constare potest quid antiquissimi, et quid antiqui, {4}intellexerunt per misericordiam et veritatem, quae toties in Verbo 
nominantur, ut apud Davidem,           Rex habitabit aeternum coram Deo, misericordiam et      veritatem para, custodiant illum, Ps. lxi 8 [A.V. 7]: </p>
