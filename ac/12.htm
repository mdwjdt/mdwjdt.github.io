<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第12节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>12.</strong>在第六个阶段，人本乎信心和爱心，言说真理，奉行良善。此时，人的言行举止被称为“活物”或“牲畜”，因为他不仅持信而行，也奉爱而行，成了属灵之人（spiritual man），被称为“神的形像”，其灵魂在信仰认知和仁爱行为中找到乐趣和滋养，这些被称作他的“食物”，但就肉身而言，他依然对感官刺激感兴趣，以致造成冲突，直等爱占据主导，成为属天之人（celestial man）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]12.</strong> In the sixth stage, we act with conviction and therefore with love in speaking truth and doing good. What we then produce is called a living soul and a beast. Because we begin to act as much from love as from conviction, we become spiritual people, who are called [God's] image.<br />In regard to our spiritual lives, we now find pleasure and nourishment in religious knowledge and acts of kindness; and these are called our food. In regard to our earthly lives, we still find pleasure and sustenance in things relating to our body and our senses, which cause strife until love takes charge and we develop a heavenly character. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 12</b></p><p><b>12.</b>
The sixth state is when, from faith, and thence from love, he speaks what is true, and does what is good: the things which he then brings forth are called the "living soul" and the "beast." And as he 
then begins to act at once and together from both faith and love, he becomes a spiritual man, who is called an "image." His spiritual life is delighted and sustained by such things as belong to the knowledges 
of faith, and to works of charity, which are called his "food;" and his natural life is delighted and sustained by those which belong to the body and the senses; whence a combat arises, until 
love gains the dominion, and he becomes a celestial man. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 12</b></p><p><b>12.</b>
The sixth state is when he utters truths and performs good deeds from faith and consequently from love. What he brings forth at this point are called a living creature and a beast. And because at this 
point he starts to act from faith and also simultaneously from love, he becomes a spiritual man, who is called an image. The spiritual life of that man finds its delight in, and is sustained by, the 
things which are associated with cognitions of faith and with charitable acts, which are called his food; and his natural life finds its delight in, and is sustained by, those which belong to the body 
and the senses. The latter give rise to conflict until love rules and he becomes a celestial man.

</p><b>12.</b>
Sextus status est cum ex fide et inde ex amore, vera loquitur et bona facit: quae tunc producit, vocantur 'anima vivens et bestia.' Et quia tunc incipit simul ac ex fide, etiam ex amore agere, fit homo 
spiritualis, qui vocatur 'imago.' Ejus vita spiritualis delectatur eI sustentatur illis quae sunt cognitionum fidei et quae sunt operum charitatis, quae vocantur 'ejus cibi': et ejus vita naturalis 
delectatur et sustentatur iis quae sunt corporis et sensuum, ex quibus pugna, usque dum amor regnat et fit homo caelestis.
