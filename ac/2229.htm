<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2229节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2229.</strong>创世记18:19. 因为我知道他，为要叫他吩咐他的众子和随从他的家属遵守耶和华的道，秉公行义，好叫耶和华将祂指着亚伯拉罕所应许的话都归给他。<br />“因为我知道他”表这是真实的。“为要叫他吩咐他的众子和随从他的家属遵守耶和华的道，秉公行义”表仁与信的全部教义皆来自祂；“众子”是指处于真理的人，“家属”是指处于良善的人，“道”是指教义，“义”与良善相关，“公”与真理相关。“好叫耶和华将祂指着亚伯拉罕所应许的话都归给他”表人性本质会为此被联结于神性本质。</p>

Verse 19. For I know him, because he will command his sons, and his house after him, and they will keep the way of Jehovah to do righteousness and judgment; that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham that which 
He hath spoken concerning him. "For I know him," signifies that it is true; "because he will command his sons, and his house after him, and they will keep the way of Jehovah to do righteousness and 
judgment," signifies that all the doctrine of charity and faith is from Him; "sons" are they who are in truths, "house," they who are in goods, "way" is doctrine, "righteousness" has regard to good, 
"judgment" to truth; "that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham that which He hath spoken concerning him," signifies that the Human Essence will for this reason be adjoined to the Divine Essence. </p>

Verse 19 For I know him that he will command his sons, and his house after him, and they will keep the way of Jehovah to do righteousness and judgement, in order that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham that 
which He has spoken concerning him. </p>
<p>'For I know him' means that it is true. 'That he will command his sons, and his house after him, and they will keep the way of Jehovah to do righteousness and 
judgement' means that from Him comes the entire doctrine of charity and of faith, 'sons' meaning people governed by truths, 'house' those governed by goods, 'the way' doctrine, 'righteousness' in regard 
to good, 'judgement' to truth. 'In order that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham that which He has spoken concerning him' means that the Human Essence will for that reason be joined to the Divine Essence. </p>

Vers. 19.  Quia noti illum, propterea quod praecipiet filiis suis, et domui suae post se, et custodient viam Jehovae ad faciendum justitiam et judicium; propterea ut adducat Jehovah super Abrahamum 
illud quod locutus est super illum. `Quia novi illum' significat verum esse: `propterea quod praecipiet filiis suis, et domui suae post se, et custodient viam Jehovae ad faciendum justitiam et judicium' 
significat quod ab Ipso omnis doctrina charitatis et fidei; `filii' sunt qui in veris; `domus' qui in bonis; `via' est doctrina'; `justitia' est de bono; `judicium' de vero: `propterea ut adducat Jehovah 
super Abrahamum illud quod locutus est super illum' significat quod ideo Humana Essentia adjuncta erit Divinae. </p>
