<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>967.</strong>恶人受罚时，天使总在场，以节制惩罚，缓解那些可怜的不幸之人所遭受的痛苦。然而，他们无法免除这些痛苦，因为在来生，万事万物之间存在一种平衡，使得罪恶必自招惩罚。若不通过惩罚消除罪恶，这种人无法被永远禁闭在某个地狱。若不被禁闭和惩罚，他们必骚扰善人社群，搅乱主所建立的以确保整个宇宙安定的秩序。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]967.</strong> When the evil are being punished, angels are always present, tempering the punishment and easing the anguish of the wretched. They cannot eliminate the pain, though, because everything in the other world is balanced in such a way that evil punishes itself. Unless wickedness was removed from wicked people by punishment, they would have to be kept in some hell forever.{*1} Otherwise they would infest communities of good people and inflict violence on the system of order established by the Lord, which ensures the welfare of the universe.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The idea that the punishments of hell are not necessarily eternal is rare but not unknown in the Christian tradition. It was considered by Origen, who wrote of the possibility that "there is a resurrection of the dead, and there is punishment, but not everlasting. For when the body is punished the soul is gradually purified, and so is restored to its ancient rank * * For all wicked men, and for daemons too, punishment has an end, and both wicked men and daemons shall be restored to their former rank" (Origen On First Principles 2:10 [Origen 1966, 146]; asterisks indicate a lacuna in the text). Swedenborg's position on whether a given individual in hell stays there forever or is eventually released appears to change markedly over time. The current section is one of several written early in his theological period in which he seems to incline toward the view that the punishment of the wicked in hell leads eventually to the purging of their evil intentions and actions (see, for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_967/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_955" target=_top>955</a> above), a cleansing that enables them to be raised up out of hell and into heaven. Other notable examples occur in Spiritual Experiences (Swedenborg 1998-2002) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_967/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_228" target=_top>228</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_967/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_2582" target=_top>2582-2583</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_967/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_2826" target=_top>2826-2827</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_967/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_3489" target=_top>3489</a>. All of these passages except the last are dated in 1748, the year before the first volume of Secrets of Heaven was published, and the last was written in either 1748 or 1749. However, as early as <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_967/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1276" target=_top>1276:1</a> of the present work Swedenborg states that in the afterlife, "Everyone's place remains fixed, never changing to eternity." As Secrets of Heaven progresses, this assertion is applied to the permanency of hell (see, for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_967/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_7541" target=_top>7541</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_967/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_8637" target=_top>8637</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_967/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_10596" target=_top>10596</a>), and near the end of the final volume Swedenborg states categorically that "those who enter hell remain there forever, and those who enter heaven remain there forever" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_967/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_10749" target=_top>10749</a>). This idea is repeated a number of times in his later works — sometimes in the form of a statement that a person's volition or dominant love, which determines the person's residency in either heaven or hell, can never be changed to eternity. Examples can be found in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_967/swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_480" target=_top>Heaven and Hell 480</a>; New Jerusalem 177, 227, 239; Spiritual Experiences (Swedenborg 1978) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_967/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_5830" target=_top>5830</a>; Revelation Explained (Swedenborg 1994-1997a) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_967/swedenborg_apocalypse-explained-whitehead_383" target=_top>383</a>.

When the evil are being punished, angels are always present who moderate the punishment and alleviate the pains of the sufferers, but cannot take them away. For there is such an equilibrium of all things 
in the other life that evil punishes itself, and unless it could be taken away by means of punishment, those in whom it exists could not but be kept in some hell to eternity, for they would otherwise 
infest the societies of the good, and offer violence to the order instituted by the Lord, wherein lies the safety of the universe. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 967</b></p><p><b>967.</b>
When the evil are being punished, angels are always present who moderate the punishment and alleviate the sufferings of those poor wretches. They cannot however take away the sufferings. In the next 
life all things are counterbalanced in such a way that evil punishes itself, and if it were not removed by means of punishments such persons could not be confined for ever in any one particular hell; 
for if not so confined and punished they would infest the communities of the good and do violence to that order established by the Lord on which the safety of the whole world depends. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 967</b>
</p><b>967.</b>
Cum puniuntur mali, semper adsunt angeli qui moderantur poenam, et dolores miserabilium leniunt, sed non auferre possunt; quia tale aequilibrium est omnium in altera vita ut ipsum malum se puniat, quod 
nisi per punitiones auferretur, tales non possent non in inferno aliquo detineri in aeternum; nam alioquin infestarent societates honorum, et ordini a Domino instituto in quo salus universi, violentiam 
inferrent. </p>
