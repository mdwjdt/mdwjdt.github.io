<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3438节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3438.</strong>“当夜耶和华向他显现，说”表主对于这模糊的直觉。这从“耶和华显现说”和“夜”的含义清楚可知。当论及主时，“耶和华显现说”是指通过神性发觉，“耶和华向他显现”是指出于神性的直觉（参看<a href="3367.htm">3367</a>节），“说”是指发觉（<a href="2862.htm">2862</a>，<a href="3395.htm">3395</a>节）；因为耶和华在祂里面，因此只要这人性尚未得着荣耀，耶和华显现就是一种神性直觉，或出于神性的直觉；故“耶和华向他显现”就具有通过神性发觉这样的含义。“夜”是指幽暗或模糊的状态（<a href="1712.htm">1712</a>节）。圣言的字义就表示这种模糊，因为字义之于内义，犹如幽暗之于光明。<br />为让人们更清楚地知道圣言字义的情形，现予以简要说明。内义与字义之间的关系就像人的内层与外层之间的关系，也就是他里面的属天、属灵之物与属世、肉体之物之间的关系。他的内层居于天堂之光，而他的外层则居于尘世之光。至于天堂之光与尘世之光之间、因而属天堂之光的事物与属尘世之光的事物之间有何不同，可参看前文（<a href="1521.htm">1521</a>-<a href="1533.htm">1533</a>，<a href="1619.htm">1619</a>-<a href="1632.htm">1632</a>，<a href="1783.htm">1783</a>，<a href="1880.htm">1880</a>，<a href="2776.htm">2776</a>，<a href="3138.htm">3138</a>，<a href="3167.htm">3167</a>，<a href="3190.htm">3190</a>，<a href="3195.htm">3195</a>，<a href="3222.htm">3222</a>，<a href="3223.htm">3223</a>，<a href="3225.htm">3225</a>，<a href="3337.htm">3337</a>，<a href="3339.htm">3339</a>，<a href="3341.htm">3341</a>，<a href="3413.htm">3413</a>节）。也就是说，这种不同就像白昼的光明和夜间的幽暗之间的不同。人因处在这幽暗中，不想知道来自主的真理拥有光明在里面，故必认为他的幽暗就是光明，反之光明就是幽暗。因为他就像猫头鹰，在夜间的幽暗中飞行时，以为自己在光明中，而在白昼的光明中飞行时，反以为自己在幽暗中。事实上，对这种人来说，人藉以向内看的内眼（internal eye，也就是理解力）没有其它形状，因为他的内眼就是这样成形的。他向下看，就是注视世俗和肉体之物时，就打开它；而向上看，就是注视属灵和属天之物时，则关闭它。对这些人而言，圣言也是这种情形。他们认为显现在字义中的事物属于光明，而显现在内义中的事物属于幽暗。真相却是，圣言的内义相对于它的字义，就如同天堂之光相对于尘世之光（<a href="3086.htm">3086</a>，<a href="3108.htm">3108</a>节），即如同白昼之光相对于夜间之光。<br />内义里面存在个体细节，数百万个体细节一起构成出现在字义中的一个具体特征，或也可说，内义里面存在具体特征，数百万具体特征一起构成出现在字义中的一个整体。人所看到的，就是这个整体，而不是存在于它里面并构成它的具体特征。但人仍能在这个整体中看到将这些具体特征联在一起的秩序，尽管是照着他自己的本质看到的。这秩序就是激发他情感的圣洁。</p>

And Jehovah appeared to him in that night, and said. That this signifies the Lord's perception concerning that obscurity, is evident from the signification of "Jehovah appearing and saying," when predicated 
of the Lord, as being to perceive from the Divine (that by "Jehovah appearing to him" is signified from the Divine, may be seen above, n. 3367; and that "saying" denotes perceiving, n. 2862, 3395); 
for Jehovah was in Him; thus so long as the human was not yet glorified, the appearing of Jehovah was Divine perception, or perception from the Divine; and therefore by "Jehovah appearing to him 
and saying" this is signified; and from the signification of "night," as being a state of shade or obscurity (n. 1712). By this obscurity is signified the literal sense of the Word, for relatively to 
the internal sense this is as shade to light. [2] A few words shall be said in order that it may be further known how the case is with the literal sense of the Word. Relatively to the literal sense, 
the internal sense is like the interior or celestial and spiritual things of a man relatively to his exterior or natural and bodily things, his interiors being in the light of heaven, and his exteriors 
in the light of the world. What the difference is between the light of heaven and the light of the world, consequently between what is of the light of heaven and what is of the light of the world, 
may be seen above (n. 1521-1533, 1619-1632, 1783, 1880, 2776, 3138, 3167, 3190, 3195, 3222, 3223, 3225, 3337, 3339, 3341, 3413), namely, that it is like the difference between the light of day and the 
shade of night.  Man, being in this shade, and not being willing to know that in truth from the Lord there is light, cannot believe otherwise than that his shade is light, and also on the other hand 
that the light is shade; for he is like a bird of night, which as it flies in the shade of night thinks that it is in the light but when in the light of day, that it is in the shade. For with such a 
person the internal eye (that is, the understanding), by which man sees interiorly, has been formed no differently than this, because he has not formed it differently; for he opens it when he looks downward, 
that is, to worldly and bodily things, and shuts it when he should look upward, that is, to spiritual and heavenly things. With such persons the case is the same in respect to the Word-that which 
appears in its literal sense they believe to be of light; but that which appears in the internal sense they believe to be of shade (for the Word appears to everyone in accordance with his quality); 
the fact being that relatively to its literal sense the internal sense of the Word is as the light of heaven to the light of the world (n. 3086, 3108); that is, as the light of day to the light of night. 
 [3] In the internal sense there are singulars, myriads of which together make one particular that is presented in the literal sense; or what is the same, in the internal sense there are particulars, 
myriads of which together make in the literal sense one general; and it is this general that is seen by man, but not the particulars which are in it and which constitute it. Nevertheless the order 
of the particulars in the general is apparent to man, but in accordance with his quality; and this order is the holiness that affects him. </p>

'Jehovah appeared to him that night, and said' means the Lord's perception regarding that obscurity. This is clear from the meaning of 'Jehovah's appearing and saying' - when it has reference to the 
Lord - as perceiving from the Divine ('Jehovah's appearing to him' is perception from the Divine, see <a href="3367.htm">3367</a>, and 'laying' is perceiving, <a href="2862.htm">2862</a>, <a href="3395.htm">3395</a>. For Jehovah was within Him, and so long as the Human 
was not yet glorified, Jehovah's 'appearing' was a Divine perception - or perception from the Divine. Therefore 'Jehovah's appearing to him and saying' has this meaning of perceiving from the Divine); 
and from the meaning of 'night' as a state of shade or obscurity, dealt with in <a href="1712.htm">1712</a>. By that obscurity is meant the literal sense of the Word, for the relationship of that sense to the internal sense 
is that of shade to light. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 To enable people to have a clearer knowledge of what the situation is with the literal sense of the Word, let this be discussed briefly: The relationship of the internal 
sense to the literal is like the relationship between the interiors and the exteriors of the human being, that is, between all that is celestial or spiritual in him and all that is natural or bodily. 
His interiors dwell in the light of heaven, but his exteriors in the light of the world. For the nature of the difference between the light of heaven and the light of the world, consequently for 
the difference between things belonging to the light of heaven and those belonging to the light of the world, see <a href="1521.htm">1521</a>-<a href="1533.htm">1533</a>, <a href="1619.htm">1619</a>-<a href="1632.htm">1632</a>, <a href="1783.htm">1783</a>, <a href="1880.htm">1880</a>, <a href="2776.htm">2776</a>, <a href="3138.htm">3138</a>, <a href="3167.htm">3167</a>, <a href="3190.htm">3190</a>, <a href="3195.htm">3195</a>, <a href="3222.htm">3222</a>, <a href="3223.htm">3223</a>, <a href="3225.htm">3225</a>, <a href="3337.htm">3337</a>, <a href="3339.htm">3339</a>, <a href="3341.htm">3341</a>, <a href="3413.htm">3413</a>. That is to say, the difference is like that existing between the light of day and the shade of night. Since man dwells in that shade and does not wish to know that truth from the 
Lord has light within it he inevitably believes that his shade is light, and indeed the reverse also - that his light is shade. For he is like the owl which, when flying in the shade of night, imagines 
it is in the light, but when flying in the light of day imagines it is in the shade. Indeed the internal eye - that is, the understanding - by means of which a person sees interiorly, assumes no other 
shape with someone like that, such being exactly how he has shaped it. For he opens it when he looks downwards, that is, to worldly and bodily things, and shuts it when he looks upwards, that is, 
to spiritual and celestial. With these people it is similar with the Word. That which appears in its literal sense they imagine to belong to the light but that which appears in the internal sense they 
imagine to belong to the shade. For how the Word appears to anyone depends on his own essential nature. In reality the internal sense of the Word in relation to its literal sense is like the light of 
heaven to the light of the world, <a href="3086.htm">3086</a>, <a href="3108.htm">3108</a>, that is, it is like the light of day to the light of night. </p>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 Within the internal sense there are individual details, millions of which together constitute 
one particular feature that occurs in the literal sense. Or what amounts to the same, within the internal sense there exist particular features, millions of which together constitute just one 
general whole that occurs in the literal sense. This general whole is what is seen by man, but not the particular features which are present within it and which constitute it. Nevertheless man can see 
within the general whole the order that holds the particular features together, though he sees it according to his own essential nature. That order is the holiness which stirs his affections. </p>

`Apparuit ad eum Jehovah in nocte illa, et dixit': quod significet perceptionem Domini de obscuro illo, constat a significatione `apparere Jehovah et dicere' cum praedicatur de Domino, quod sit ex Divino 
percipere; quod `apparere ad eum Jehovah' sit ex Divino, videatur n. 3367, et quod `dicere' sit percipere, n. 2862, 3395; Jehovah enim fuit in Ipso, ita quamdiu Humanum nondum glorificatum fuit, 
apparitio Jehovae fuit perceptio Divina seu perceptio ex Divino, quare per apparere ad eum Jehovah et dicere, {1}id significatur; ex significatione `noctis' quod sit status umbrae seu obscurum, de qua 
n. 1712; per obscurum illud significatur sensus litteralis Verbi, se enim ille respective ad sensum internum habet sicut umbra ad lucem: [2] ut adhuc sciatur quomodo se habet cum sensu litterali Verbi, 
paucis dicendum: se habet sensus internus ad sensum litteralem, sicut apud hominem ejus interiora, seu caelestia et spiritualia, ad ejus exteriora seu naturalia et corporea; interiora ejus in luce 
caeli sunt, at exteriora in luce mundi; inter lucem caeli et lucem mundi, consequenter inter illa quae lucis caeli et illa quae lucis mundi sunt, qualis differentia sit, videatur n. 1521-1533, 1619-1632, 
1783, 1880, 2776, 3138, 3167, 3190, 3195, 3222, 3223, 3225, 3337, 3339, 3341, 3413, nempe quod talis, qualis est inter lucem diei et umbram noctis; homo quia est in umbra illa et non scire vult quod 
in vero a Domino sit lux, non aliter credere potest quam quod umbra ejus sit lux, immo etiam vicissim quod lux sit umbra; est enim velut noctua, quae cum in umbra noctis volat, putat se esse in luce, 
at cum in luce diei, putat se esse in umbra; oculus enim internus, hoc est, intellectus, per quem {2}homo interius videt, apud talem non aliter est formatus, nam illum non aliter formavit, aperit 
enim eum cum deorsum spectat, hoc est, ad mundam et corporea, et claudit illum cum sursum, hoc est, ad spiritualia et caelestia; apud illos Verbum simile est, quod in ejus sensu litterali apparet; hoc 
credunt esse lucis, at quod in sensu interno, id credunt esse umbrae; apparet enim Verbum cuivis {2}secundum quale ejus; cum tamen sensus internus Verbi se habeat respective ad sensum ejus litteralem, 
sicut lux caeli ad lucem mundi, n. 3086, 3108, hoc est, sicut lux diei ad lucem noctis. [3] In sensu interno sunt singularia quorum myriades simul faciunt unum particulare quod in sensu litterali sistitur; 
seu quod idem, in sensu interno sunt particularia quorum myriades simul faciunt unum commune quod in sensu litterali est; hoc commune est quod apparet homini, non autem particularia quae insunt 
et quae constituunt; usque tamen ordo particularium in communi apparet homini, sed secundum ejus quale; ordo ille est sanctum quod afficit. </p>
