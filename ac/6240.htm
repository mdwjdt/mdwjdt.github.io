<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6240节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6240.</strong>“就是你的”表它们将在来自内在，或存在于内在里面的理性层中。这从以下事实清楚可知：“约瑟”所代表的内在属天层存在于理性层中（参看<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>，<a href="4963.htm">4963</a>节）；因此，“是你的”表示它们将在理性层中，正如前面“是我的”表示它们将在属世层中，“雅各”所代表的属世层的真理就存在于这属世层中（<a href="6236.htm">6236</a>节）。有必要阐述一下何为理性层。内在人里面的理解力区域被称为理性层，而外在人里面的理解力区域被称为属世层；因此，理性层是内在的，属世层是外在的；这二者彼此完全不同，互相分离。一个真正理性的人正是那被称为属天人的人；这种人享有对良善的觉知，并通过这良善享有对真理的觉知。而没有这种觉知，只有一种意识，即某事是真的，因为他就是如此被教导的，并由此拥有一种良知的人不是一个真正理性的人，而是一个内层属世人。那些属于主的属灵教会的人就是这种人。他们不同于属天人，犹如月光不同于日光；因此，主向属灵天使显为一轮月亮，向属天天使显为一轮太阳（参看<a href="1521.htm">1521</a>，<a href="1529.htm">1529</a>-<a href="1531.htm">1531</a>，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>，<a href="4696.htm">4696</a>节）。<br />许多世人以为一个理性人就是一个能娴熟地推理许多主题，并将他的推理联结起来，好使他的结论看似真理的人。但这种能力甚至出现在非常坏的人当中，他们擅长推理，能说服人相信邪恶是良善，虚假是真理，或良善是邪恶，真理是虚假。凡停下来反思的人都能看出，这是一种恶毒的幻想，并非理性。理性在于从内在看出并发觉良善就是良善，由此看出并发觉真理就是真理；因为这种人的看见和觉知来自天堂。那些属于主的属灵教会的人之所以是内层属世人，是因为他们只承认他们从父母和老师那里所接受，并且后来自己又确认的东西为真理；除了通过他们自己所确认的东西外，他们无法通过其它任何源头从内在看见并发觉一件事是不是真的。属天人则不然，正因如此，后者是理性人，而前者是内层属世人。“约瑟”所代表的内在属天层存在于理性层中；而“以色列”所代表的属灵良善存在于内层属世层中（<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>节）；因为他们是“以色列”所代表的属灵人和“约瑟”所代表的属天人。</p>

Shall be thine. That this signifies that they shall be in the rational, which is the internal, is evident from the fact that the internal celestial which is represented by Joseph, is in the rational 
(see n. 4286, 4963); and therefore by "being thine" is signified that they shall be in the rational, as before by "being mine" was signified that they should be in the natural, in which is the truth of 
the natural which is represented by Jacob (n. 6236). What the rational is shall be briefly told. The intellectual of the internal man is called "rational," but the intellectual of the external man is 
called "natural;" thus the rational is internal, and the natural is external; and they are perfectly distinct from each other. But a truly rational man is no other than he who is called a celestial 
man, and who has perception of good, and from good perception of truth; whereas he who has not this perception, but only the knowledge that a thing is true because he is so instructed, and from this has 
conscience, is not truly a rational man, but is an interior natural man. Such are they who are of the Lord's spiritual church. They differ from the celestial as the light of the moon differs from the 
light of the sun; and therefore the Lord appears to the spiritual as a moon, but to the celestial as a sun (see n. 1521, 1529-1531, 4060, 4696). [2] Many in the world suppose that a rational man is 
one who can reason acutely about many things, and so join his reasonings together that his conclusions may appear like truth; but this is found in the very worst of men, who are able to reason skillfully 
and persuade that evils are goods, and that falsities are truths; and the reverse. But he who reflects can see that this is vicious phantasy, and not what is rational. The rational consists in inwardly 
seeing and perceiving that good is good, and from this that truth is truth; for the sight and perception of such men are from heaven. That they who are of the Lord's spiritual church are interiorly 
natural, is because they only acknowledge as truth that which they have received from their parents and masters, and afterward have confirmed in themselves; and do not see inwardly, and perceive, 
whether it is true from any other source than that they have confirmed it in themselves. It is otherwise with the celestial; and it is from this that the latter are rational, but the former interiorly 
natural. The internal celestial which is represented by Joseph, is in the rational; whereas the spiritual good which is represented by Israel, is in the interior natural (n. 4286); for it is the spiritual 
who are represented by Israel, and the celestial who are represented by Joseph. </p>

'Will be yours' means that they will be in the rational which is within the internal. This is clear from the consideration that the internal celestial represented by 'Joseph' exists in the rational, <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>, <a href="4963.htm">4963</a>, and therefore 'will be yours' means that they will be in the rational, just as previously 'they are mine' meant within the natural, in which the truth of the natural represented by 'Jacob' 
exists, <a href="6236.htm">6236</a>. </p>
<p>Let a brief statement be made about what the rational is The area of understanding within the internal man is called the rational, while the area of understanding in the external man 
is called the natural, so that the rational is internal and the natural is external; and the two are completely distinct and separate from each other. A truly rational person is none other than one who 
is called a celestial person; that person enjoys a perception of what is good, and from that good a perception of what is true. But a person who does not have such perception but merely an awareness 
that a thing is true, because he has been taught that it is, and has a conscience as a result of that awareness, is not truly a rational person but an interiorly natural one. He is what those who belong 
to the Lord's spiritual Church are like. These two kinds of people are as different from each other as the light of the moon is from the light of the sun; and that also is why the Lord is seen by 
spiritual angels as the moon but by celestial ones as the sun, <a href="1521.htm">1521</a>, <a href="1529.htm">1529</a>-<a href="1531.htm">1531</a>, <a href="4060.htm">4060</a>, <a href="4696.htm">4696</a>. Very many in the world imagine that a rational person is one who can reason with skill on many subjects and 
link one piece of reasoning to another in such a way that the conclusion he draws seems to be the truth. But that ability occurs even in very wicked people who are expert reasoners and can make the 
deduction that evil things are good and false ideas are true, or that good things are evil and true ideas are false. But anyone who stops to reflect can that this is wicked imagination and not rationality. 
Rationality consists in seeing inwardly and perceiving that what is good is indeed good, and from this that what is true is indeed true; for such vision and perception of these things comes from 
heaven. The reason why those who belong to the Lord's spiritual Church are interiorly natural people is that they acknowledge as true only what they have learned from parents and teachers and later on 
firmly established for themselves. There is nothing else from which they can see inwardly or perceive whether a thing is true except what they have thus firmly established for themselves - unlike those 
who are celestial; which is why the latter are rational people, whereas the former are interior natural ones. The internal celestial, which 'Joseph' represents, exists in the rational, but spiritual 
good, which 'Israel' represents, exists in the interior natural, <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>; for they are spiritual people who are represented by' Israel', and celestial ones who are represented by 'Joseph'. </p>

`Tibi erunt': quod significet quod in rationali quod in  interno, constat ex eo quod caeleste internum quod repraesentatur per `Josephum', sit in rationali, n. 4286, 4963; ac ideo per `tibi erunt' significatur 
quod in rationali, ut prius per `mihi illi' {1} quod in naturali, in quo verum naturalis quod per `Jacobum' repraesentatur, n. 6236.  Quid rationale {2} paucis dicendum: intellectuale interni 
hominis dicitur rationale, at intellectuale externi hominis dicitur naturale; ita rationale est internum et naturale {3} externum; suntque inter se distinctissima; sed vere rationalis homo non est 
nisi quam qui caelestis homo vocatur, et qui perceptionem habet boni, et ex bono {4}perceptionem veri; at qui non perceptionem illam habet, sed modo cognitionem quod verum sit, quia ita instructus, ac 
inde conscientiam, non vere est rationalis homo sed est homo interior naturalis; qui a spirituali Domini Ecclesia sunt, tales sunt; {5} differunt inter se sicut differt lumen lunae a lumine solis; quapropter 
etiam Dominus apparet spiritualibus ut luna, at caelestibus ut sol, n. 1521, 1529-1531, 4060, 4696. (s){6}Plures in mundo putant quod rationalis homo sit qui ingeniose potest ratiocinari de 
multis, et ratiocinia ita conjungere ut quod concludit, appareat {7}sicut verum; sed hoc cadit etiam in pessimos, qui (x)ratiocinari possunt solerter et inducere quod mala sint bona, et quod falsa sint 
vera, et quoque vice versa; sed quod hoc sit phantasia prava, non autem rationale, qui reflectit, potest {8}videre: rationale est intus videre et percipere quod bonum sit bonum, et inde quod verum sit 
verum, visus enim illorum et perceptio est e caelo; quod illi qui ab Ecclesia `Domini spirituali' sint interius naturales, est quia id modo pro vero {9} agnoscunt quod a parentibus et magistris hauserunt, 
et {10} postea ipsi apud se confirmarunt, {11}et non vident intus et percipiunt {12}num verum sit aliunde quam ex eo quod apud se id confirmarunt; aliter caelestes; inde est quod (s)hi sint rationales, 
illi autem interius naturales. (s) Caeleste internum quod repraesentatur per `Josephum', est in rationali; at bonum spirituale quod repraesentatur per `Israelem', est in interiore naturali, 
n. 4286; sunt enim spirituales qui repraesentantur per `Israelem', et caelestes qui per `Josephum'. @1 i significatur$ @2 i etiam$ @3 i est$ @4 quid verum$ @5 i ac$ @6 in A directions are given 
to insert this separate sheet at end of number, so that the last sentence Caeleste internum etc. would come here.$ @7 ut$ @8 scire$ @9 i et bono$ @10 i quod$ @11 ita$ @12 num id quod agnoscunt suo
