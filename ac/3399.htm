<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3399节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3399.</strong>就内义而言，“和你的妻子同寝”表败坏和玷污真理，此处的真理是神性，因为“妻子”或利百加代表神圣真理，如前所示。这从以下事实可以看出来：在圣言中，“同寝”、“淫行”和“妓女”无非表示对良善的玷污和对真理的歪曲（<a href="2466.htm">2466</a>，<a href="2729.htm">2729</a>节）。这是因为淫行与婚姻之爱完全相反，以至于它们是对婚姻之爱的毁灭；婚姻之爱源于良善与真理的婚姻（<a href="2508.htm">2508</a>，<a href="2618.htm">2618</a>，<a href="2727.htm">2727</a>-<a href="2759.htm">2759</a>，<a href="3132.htm">3132</a>节）。因此，那些违反良善与真理，或毁灭它们的事物在圣言中就被称为“淫行”。<br />但要知道，那些属于属灵教会的人无法将良善玷污到亵渎它的程度，因为他们对良善的接受程度到不了像属天之人那样能直觉它的程度。然而，他们能亵渎真理，因为他们能承认真理。不过，在教会的末期，他们甚至不能承认真理，因为那时所盛行的是，他们普遍不信主、死后生命和内在人。所盛行的这种普遍不信能防止他们深入信的内在真理。这种普遍盛行在每个人身上的东西限制并阻止他们更深地进入到这类事物中，无论是在此人没有意识到这种普遍不信的时候，还是在他以为自己相信的时候。<br />但属于属天教会的人却能亵渎良善，因为这些人能接受良善，甚至于能直觉它。这就是大洪水前之人的情形，因此他们与其他人隔离开，被关在与其他人的地狱隔离的地狱中（对此，参看<a href="1265.htm">1265</a>-<a href="1272.htm">1272</a>节）。经上说“那人赶出伊甸园，耶和华又从伊甸园的东边安设基路伯，还有剑的火焰自行转动，要把守生命树的道路”，就表示防止亵渎良善的情况再次发生（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创3.24.htm">3:24</a>；参看<w1>308<w2>308<w3>，<w1>310<w2>310<w3>节）。</p>

That in the internal sense "to lie with a woman" denotes to pervert and adulterate truth (here truth Divine, because by the "woman" or Rebekah is represented Divine truth, as shown above) is evident 
from the fact that by "lying with," by "adultery," and by "harlotry" in the Word, nothing else is signified than perversions of good and falsifications of truth (n. 2466, 2729); and this for the reason 
that adulteries are diametrically contrary to conjugial love, insomuch that they are destructive of it; and conjugial love is from the marriage of good and truth (n. 2508, 2618, 2727-2759, 3132); and 
therefore those things which are contrary to good and truth, or which destroy them, are in the Word called "adulteries."  [2] Be it known, however, that they who are of the spiritual church cannot 
adulterate good so as to profane it, because they cannot receive good so as to have a perception of it, like the celestial; and yet they can profane truth, because this they can acknowledge. But in the 
last time of the church they cannot even acknowledge truth, because there then universally reigns with them unbelief concerning the Lord, concerning the life after death, and concerning the internal 
man; and an unbelief that universally reigns, prevents the truths of faith from penetrating interiorly. With everyone that which is universal limits and hinders such things from entering deeply, both 
when the man is ignorant of them, and also when he supposes that he believes them. [3] But they who are capable of profaning good are those of the celestial church, for these can receive good even to 
perception. This was the case with the antediluvians, who were therefore secluded from all others, and who are confined in a hell separate from the hells of others (n. 1265-1272); and that the profanation 
of good should not any longer take place is signified by its being said that when man was cast out of Eden, Jehovah caused to dwell at the east of the garden of Eden cherubim, and the flame of 
a sword that turned itself, to keep the way of the tree of lives (Gen. 3:24; see n. 308, 310). </p>

The expression 'lying with a wife' means in the internal sense perverting and adulterating truth, here truth that is Divine, because 'a wife' - Rebekah - represents Divine Truth, as shown above. This 
may be seen from the consideration that instances of lying together, adultery, and prostitution in the Word do not mean anything other than perversions of good and falsifications of truth, as shown in <a href="2466.htm">2466</a>, <a href="2729.htm">2729</a>. The reason why they do so is that all adultery is absolutely contrary to conjugial love, so much so that it is destructive of it; and conjugial love originates in the marriage of good and 
truth, <a href="2508.htm">2508</a>, <a href="2618.htm">2618</a>, <a href="2727.htm">2727</a>-<a href="2759.htm">2759</a>, <a href="3132.htm">3132</a>. Consequently things that are contrary to good and truth, or that destroy them, are in the Word called forms of adultery. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But it should be realized that those 
who belong to the spiritual Church are not able to adulterate good to such an extent that they profane it, for the reason that they are not able to receive good so far as to perceive it, as those who 
are celestial do. They are able however to profane truth because they are able to acknowledge it. Yet in the final period of the Church they are not able even to acknowledge truth, because at that 
time universal disbelief prevails concerning the Lord, concerning life after death, and concerning the internal man. And the disbelief which reigns universally makes it impossible for them to penetrate 
into the interior truths of faith. That which prevails with everyone universally limits them and keeps them back from entering more deeply into such things, even when the person is unaware of that universal 
disbelief and also when he supposes that he does believe. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But those who are able to profane good are such as belong to the celestial Church, for they are able to receive it so as to perceive 
it, as was done by those living before the Flood who have consequently been segregated from everyone else and are kept in a hell separated from the hells of others - regarding which see <a href="1265.htm">1265</a>-<a href="1272.htm">1272</a>. 
The prevention of the occurrence ever again of the profanation of good is meant by the reference to Jehovah expelling man and causing cherubim to dwell away from the east towards the garden of Eden, 
and the flame of a sword turning this way and that to guard the way of the tree of life, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%203:24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 3:24</a>. On these matters, see <a href="308.htm">308</a>, <a href="310.htm">310</a>. </p>

</p><b>3399.</b>
Quod `cubare cum muliere' in sensu interno sit pervertere et adulterare verum, hic Verum Divinum quia per `mulierem' seu Rebeccam repraesentatur Divinum Verum, ut supra ostensum, constare potest ex 
eo quod per concubitus, adulteria et meretricatus in Verbo non aliud significetur quam perversiones boni et falsificationes veri, ut n. 2466, 2729 ostensum; et hoc ex causa quia adulteria sunt prorsus 
contra amorem conjugialem, adeo ut sint ejus destructiva, et amor conjugialis est ex conjugio boni et veri, n. 2508, 2618, 2727-2759, 3132, ideo illa quae contra bonum et verum sunt, seu quae illa destruunt, 
vocantur in Verbo adulteria. [2] Sed sciendum quod illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali sunt, non possint adulterare bonum usque adeo ut profanent illud, ex causa quia non possunt recipere bonum usque 
ad perceptionem ejus, sicut caelestes; sed quod possint profanare verum quia hoc possunt agnoscere; sed {1}ultimo tempore Ecclesiae, nec possunt agnoscere verum quia tunc apud illos universaliter 
regnat incredulitas de Domino, {2}de vita post mortem, (c)et de interno homine, et incredulitas quae universaliter regnat, facit ut vera fidei non interius penetrent; universale apud unumquemvis limitat 
et arcet ne talia penitius intrent, etiam homine nesciente, et quoque cum autumat se credere: [3] at qui profanare bonum possunt, sunt {3}ab Ecclesia caelesti, illi enim usque ad perceptionem possunt 
recipere illud; ut quoque factum est ab antediluvianis, qui ideo seclusi ab omnibus detinentur in inferno {4}separato ab infernis aliorum, de quibus videatur n. 1265-1272; et ne profanatio boni amplius 
existeret, {5}significatur per quod           Jehovah, ejecto homine, habitare fecerit ab oriente ad      hortum Edenis cherubos, et flammam gladii vertentis se, ad      custodiendum viam arboris 
vitarum, Gen. iii 24, de quibus n. 308, 310. @1 i in$  @2 deque$  @3 i qui$  @4 after aliorum$  @5 dicitur$  </p>
