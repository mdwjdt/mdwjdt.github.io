<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8979节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8979.</strong>“他若是一个女人的主人”表与快乐联结的真理。这从“主人”和“女人”的含义清楚可知：“主人”是指真理，如下文所述；“女人”是指良善，但在此是指快乐，也如下文所述。“主人”之所以是指真理，是因为“主人”在此是指作为一个女人的男人（或丈夫）的奴仆，“奴仆”和“女人的男人（或丈夫）”在内义上都表示真理（关于“奴仆”表示真理，参看<a href="8974.htm">8974</a>节；关于“男人”也表示真理，参看<a href="3134.htm">3134</a>，<a href="3309.htm">3309</a>，<a href="3459.htm">3459</a>，<a href="7716.htm">7716</a>节）。“女人”之所以表示快乐，是因为“男人的女人（或妻子）”在内义上表示良善（<a href="915.htm">915</a>，<a href="2517.htm">2517</a>，<a href="4823.htm">4823</a>，<a href="6014.htm">6014</a>，<a href="8337.htm">8337</a>节）。但由于来自以色列人的奴仆代表虽拥有教义真理，却没有相应的良善的外在教会成员（<a href="8974.htm">8974</a>节），因为他行真理不是为了真理，行良善不是为了良善，而是为了回报，故他所行的真理或良善里面有自我的思想；这种思想与良善无关，只与快乐有关；因为就灵义而言，除了属于爱主爱邻的东西外，没有什么东西可被称为良善。诚然，这种良善在属世人里面也表现为快乐；但使它成为良善的，却是它里面的属灵之物。<br />为进一步了解这一切的性质，要牢记这一点：内在教会成员的行为源于仁爱，因而源于对邻舍的爱与情感；而外在教会成员的行为不是源于仁之良善，而是源于信之真理，因而不是源于对邻舍的爱与情感，而是源于服从，因为这类行为是被命令的。因此，内在教会成员是自由的，而外在教会成员相对来说就是一个奴仆；因为出于爱与情感行事的人是出于自由行事（<a href="2870.htm">2870</a>-<a href="2893.htm">2893</a>节）；而出于服从行事的人则不是出于自由行事，因为服从不是自由。这就是出于仁之良善行事的人是一个真正的属灵教会成员的原因；故在圣言中，他由以色列来代表。然而，出于信之真理，而非仁之良善行事的人并不是一个真正的属灵教会成员，而是相对来说是属灵教会成员的奴仆；故他由被称为“希伯来奴仆”的奴仆来代表，因为他是从以色列人那里买来的。</p>

If he is master* of a woman. That this signifies truth with delight conjoined, is evident from the signification of "master," as being truth (of which below) and from the signification of "a woman," 
as being good, but here delight (of which also below). That "a master" denotes truth, is because by "master" is here meant the manservant as the woman's man, and in the internal sense by a "manservant," 
as also by a woman's "man," is signified truth. (That truth is signified by "a manservant," see n. 8974; also that it is signified by "a man," n. 3134, 3309, 3459, 7716.) That "a woman" denotes delight 
is because by the woman of a man is signified in the internal sense good (n. 915, 2517, 4823, 6014, 8337). But as by a manservant from the Israelitish people is represented a man of the external 
church, who indeed has truth of doctrine, but not the corresponding good (n. 8974), because he does not do truth for the sake of truth, nor good for the sake of good, but that he may be recompensed; therefore 
in the truth and good which he does, there is the idea of self, and this idea does not belong to good, but to delight; for in the spiritual sense nothing is called "good" except that which belongs 
to love to the Lord and to love toward the neighbor. This good does indeed appear also as delight in the natural man; but it is the spiritual that is within it that makes it to be good. [2] That 
it may be further known how the case is in regard to this, it is to be borne in mind that the man of the internal church acts from charity, thus from the affection which is of love toward the neighbor; 
whereas the man of the external church does not act from the good of charity, but from the truth of faith; thus not from the affection which is of love toward the neighbor, but from obedience, because 
it has been so commanded. It flows from this that the man of the internal church is free, but the man of the external church is relatively a servant; for he who acts from the affection which is of 
love, acts from freedom (n. 2870-2893); but he who acts from obedience does not act from freedom, for to obey is not freedom. This is the reason why he who acts from the good of charity is a true man 
of the spiritual church, and therefore in the Word is represented by Israel, whereas he who does not act from the good of charity, but from the truth of faith, is not a true man of the spiritual church, 
but is relatively his servant; and he was therefore represented by the manservant who was called a "Hebrew servant," because bought from the sons of Israel. * "Master" is dominus all through this 
chapter. [REVISER] </p>

'If he is master of a woman' means truth together with delight linked to it This is clear from the meaning of 'master' as truth, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'a woman omen' as good, but 
at this point as delight, also dealt with below. The reason why 'master' is truth is that 'master' in this instance is used to refer to the slave as the man (or husband) of a woman, and in the internal 
sense both 'slave' and 'man (or husband) of a woman' mean truth - regarding 'slave', see above in <a href="8974.htm">8974</a>, and regarding 'man', <a href="3134.htm">3134</a>, <a href="3309.htm">3309</a>, <a href="3459.htm">3459</a>, <a href="7716.htm">7716</a>. The reason why 'a woman' is delight is that 'the 
woman (or wife) of a man' in the internal sense means good, <a href="915.htm">915</a>, <a href="2517.htm">2517</a>, <a href="4823.htm">4823</a>, <a href="6014.htm">6014</a>, <a href="8337.htm">8337</a>. But since a member of the external Church, who indeed possesses the truth of religious teachings but not its complementary 
good, is represented by a slave from the Israelite people, <a href="8974.htm">8974</a>; and since he does not do the truth for its own sake, or good for its own sake, but for reward, there lies within the truth 
or good he does the thought of self. This thought of self has no association with good, only with delight; for nothing else is called good in the spiritual sense except that which is a form of love to 
the Lord and love towards the neighbour. This good does, it is true, present itself also as delight in the natural man; but the spiritual within it is what causes it to be good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 To know more about 
the nature of all this it should be kept in mind that the actions of a member of the internal Church spring from charity, thus from affection and love towards the neighbour, whereas the actions of 
a member of the external Church do not spring from the good of charity but from the truth of faith, thus not from affection and love towards the neighbour but from obedience because such actions are 
commanded. Consequently the member of the internal Church is free, whereas the member of the external Church in comparison is a slave; for one whose actions spring from love and affection acts in freedom, <a href="2870.htm">2870</a>-<a href="2893.htm">2893</a>. But someone whose actions spring from obedience does not act in freedom, for acting in obedience is not freedom. This is the reason why one whose actions spring from the good of charity 
is a true member of the spiritual Church; he therefore is represented in the Word by Israel. Someone however whose actions do not spring from the good of charity but from the truth of faith is not 
a true member of the spiritual Church, but is in comparison one who serves him. He therefore was represented by the slave who was called 'a Hebrew slave' because he had been bought from the children of Israel. </p>

`Si dominus mulieris ille': quod significet verum cum {1}adjuncto jucundo, constat ex significatione `domini' quod sit verum, de qua sequitur, et ex significatione `mulieris' quod sit bonum, hic autem 
jucundum, de qua etiam sequitur. Quod `dominus' sit verum, est quia per `dominum' hic intelligitur servus ut vir mulieris, et in sensu interno per `servum,' ut et per `virum mulieris,' significatur 
verum; quod per `servum,' videatur supra n. 8974, et quod per `virum, n. 3134, 3309, 3459, 7716.  Quod `mulier' sit jucundum, est quia per `mulierem viri' in sensu interno significatur bonum, n. 915, 
2517, 4823, 6014, (x)8337; sed quia per servum ex {2}populo Israelitico repraesentatur externae Ecclesiae homo, cui quidem verum doctrinae est sed non bonum correspondens, n. 8974, quia non facit verum 
propter verum nec bonum propter bonum, sed ut remuneretur, idcirco in vero (c)et bono quae facit est idea sui; haec idea non est boni sed est jucundi, nam non aliud in sensu spirituali dicitur bonum 
quam quod est amoris in Dominum et amoris erga proximum; hoc bonum apparet quidem etiam ut jucundum in naturali homine, sed spirituale quod inest facit ut bonum sit. 	2 Ut sciatur (x)ulterius quomodo 
cum hoc se habet, tenendum est quod internae Ecclesiae homo ex charitate agat, ita ex affectione quae amoris erga proximum; externae autem Ecclesiae homo non ex bono charitatis agit sed ex vero fidei, 
ita non ex affectione quae amoris erga proximum sed ex oboedientia, quia ita mandatum; inde fluit quod internae Ecclesiae homo liber sit, at externae Ecclesiae homo respective servus, nam qui ex affectione 
quae amoris {3}, is ex libero agit, n. 2870- 2893; at qui ex oboedientia, is non ex libero agit, nam oboedire non est liberum; haec causa est quod qui ex bono charitatis agit sit verus Ecclesiae 
spiritualis homo; is ideo in Verbo per Israelem repraesentatur; at qui non ex bono charitatis sed ex vero fidei agit non sit verus Ecclesiae spiritualis homo, sed ejus servus respective; is ideo 
per servum, qui vocatus est servus Hebraeus quia emptus ex filiis Israelis, repraesentatus est. @1 conjuncto IT$ @2 filiis Israelis$ @3 i agit$ </p>
