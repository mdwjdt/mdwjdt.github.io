<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第803节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>803.</strong>“飞鸟、牲畜、野兽和地上的一切爬行物”表他们的信念，其中“飞鸟”是对虚假的情感，“牲畜”是恶欲，“野兽”是乐趣，“爬行物”是肉体和世俗的兴趣。这一点从前面有关飞鸟(<w1>40<w2>40<w3>节，<x1>创7.14<x2>7:14-15<x3>）和牲畜(<x1>创7.14<x2>7:14-15<x3>，以及<w1>45<w2>45-46<w3>，<w1>142<w2>142-143<w3>，<w1>246<w2>246<w3>节）的含义清楚可知。由于飞鸟表觉性、理性和知识，故它们也表这些事物的反面，诸如败坏理性之物，虚假和对虚假的情感。此处全面描述了大洪水前之人的信念，也就是说，他们里面有对虚假的情感、恶欲、乐趣、肉体和世俗的兴趣。所有这些事物皆存在于信念中，而人却没有直接意识到这一点，因为他以为虚假的原则或虚假的信念只是某种简单物，或普通物。然而，他大错特错了，因为情况恰恰相反。人的每一个情感都从其觉知之物，同时从其意愿之物获得其存在和性质，以至于就其觉知的一切事物和意愿的一切事物而言，整个人存在于其每一个情感中，甚至就在其情感的最个别或最小之物中。<br />我通过大量经历已十分清楚这一点。例如（仅举一例），在来生（灵界），一个精灵（或灵）的品质单单通过他思想的一个观念就能得知。事实上，天使通过主拥有这样的能力：他们只是看看某个人，就能立刻知道他的秉性，毫无差池。由此明显可知，一个人的每一个观念，每一个情感，甚至其每一丁点情感都是他自己的一个形像和一个样式，也就是说，其中都包含或近或远地来自其全部觉知和其全部意愿的某种东西。大洪水前之人的可怖信念是这样来描述的：他们有对虚假的情感，也有对邪恶的情感，也就是恶欲，还有乐趣，以及最终所有肉体和世俗的兴趣。所有这些都存在于这类信念中，不仅存在于总体的信念中，而且存在于信念的最个别或最小之物中，其中肉体和世俗之物居于主导地位。若人知道一个虚假原则或一个虚假信念包含多少东西，他必会不寒而栗。它是一副地狱的形像。不过，若它们是纯真或无知的产物，那他里面的虚假就能轻易被驱散。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]803.</strong> Including the bird and the beast and the wild animal and every crawling thing crawling on the earth symbolizes their self-deceptions. Birds symbolize an attachment to falsity, the beast symbolizes corrupt desires, the wild animal symbolizes sensual pleasure, the crawling thing crawling symbolizes bodily and earthly yearnings, and these different impulses are contained within the self-deceptions. The symbolism here is established by earlier demonstrations of the meaning of birds and beasts. A treatment of birds appeared at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_803/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_40" target=_top>40</a> and above at verses <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_803/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_14-15" target=_top>14-15</a> of this chapter [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_803/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_776" target=_top>776-778</a>]. A treatment of beasts also appeared in the latter place [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_803/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_774" target=_top>774</a>] and at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_803/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_45" target=_top>45</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_803/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_46" target=_top>46</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_803/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_142" target=_top>142</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_803/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_143" target=_top>143</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_803/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_246" target=_top>246</a> as well.<br />Because birds symbolize matters of understanding, reason, and fact, they also symbolize the opposites of these — corrupt reasoning, falsity, and attachment to falsity.<br />These words portray the self-deceptions of a pre-Flood person in their entirety, specifically the feelings of attachment to falsity, corrupt desires, sensual pleasures, and bodily and earthly yearnings that their self-deceptions carried with them. All these impulses are inherent in a person's delusions, although no one realizes it. We tend to consider a false premise or conviction an irreducible unit, or else a single generalized concept, but we are very wrong. The situation is completely otherwise. Each of our feelings derives its manifestation and its nature from resources in our intellect and in our will. Our whole being, then, with all that we understand and all that we will, enters into every emotion that we have and in fact into the most detailed, minute aspects of our emotions.<br />This has become clear to me from a wealth of experience.<br />[2] To mention a single example, in the other life spirits can be recognized by just one of the individual ideas that go into their thinking. The angels even receive from the Lord an ability merely to look at a person and fathom immediately what the person's character is, without making the slightest mistake.{*1} This shows clearly that every one of our ideas, every one of our feelings, and indeed every shred of feeling in us, no matter how small, is an image and portrait of us. To put it another way, each of these contains an element — whether closely or distantly related — of every thought in our intellect and every impetus of our will.<br />These verses, then, describe the appalling convictions of a pre-Flood person and how they carry with them attachment to falsity, attachment to evil (corrupt desires), sensual pleasure, and bodily and earthly yearnings. All these impulses are inherent in such convictions, in which bodily and earthly yearnings predominate — and not only in those convictions as a whole but in the most detailed, minute aspects of them.<br />If we realized the extent of the consequences for one false assumption or one false persuasion, we would be horrified. Each is like an effigy of hell. But if we adopt it in all innocence or ignorance, the falsity of it is easily dispelled.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg emphasizes that while it is possible to tell lies on earth, it is not possible to do so in heaven, where "no one can conceal inner character by facial expression and pretend." This is because angels can see the quality of others "instantly, from their faces" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_803/swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_48" target=_top>Heaven and Hell 48</a>). Moreover, as indicated in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_803/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_925#subsection-2-2" target=_top>925:2</a>, in heaven it is even possible to discern the nature of a being from his or her aura.

As to fowl, and as to beast, and as to wild animal, and as to every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. That these signify the persuasions of those in whom "fowl" signifies affections of what 
is false, "beast" cupidities, "wild animal" pleasures, and "creeping thing" things corporeal and earthly, is evident from what has been already shown respecting the signification of "fowls" and of "beasts" 
(concerning "fowls" in n. 40, and above at verses 14 and 15 of this chapter; concerning "beasts" also in the same place, and in n. 45, 46, 142, 143, and 246). As "fowls" signify things of understanding, 
of reason, and of memory-knowledge, they signify also the contraries of these, as what is of perverted reason, falsities, and affections of what is false. The persuasions of the antediluvians 
are here fully described, namely, that there were in them affections of what is false, cupidities, pleasures, things corporeal and earthly. That all these are within persuasions, man is not aware, 
believing a principle or a persuasion of what is false to be but a simple thing, or one general thing; but he is much mistaken, for the case is very different. Every single affection of a man derives 
its existence and nature from things of his understanding and at the same time from those of his will, so that the whole man, both as to all things of his understanding and all things of his will, is 
in his every affection, and even in the most individual or least things of his affection.  [2] This has been made evident to me by numerous experiences, as for example (to mention only one) that the 
quality of a spirit can be known in the other life from one single idea of his thought. Indeed angels have from the Lord the power of knowing at once, when they but look upon anyone, what his character 
is, nor is there any mistake. It is therefore evident that every single idea and every single affection of a man, even every least bit of his affection, is an image of him and a likeness of him, that 
is, there is present therein, nearly and remotely, something from all his understanding and from all his will. In this way then are described the direful persuasions of the antediluvians: that there 
were in them affections of what is false, and affections of what is evil, or cupidities, and also pleasures, and finally things corporeal and earthly. All these are within such persuasions; and not only 
in the persuasions in general, but also in the most individual or least things of the persuasions, in which things corporeal and earthly predominate. If man should know how much there is within one 
principle and one persuasion of what is false, he would shudder. It is a kind of image of hell. But if it be from innocence or from ignorance, the falsities therein are easily shaken off. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 803</b></p><p><b>803.</b>
'Birds, beasts, wild animals, and every creeping thing that creeps over the earth' means their persuasions, among which 'birds' means affections for falsity, 'beasts' evil desires, wild animals' pleasures, 
'creeping thing that creeps' bodily and earthly interests. This becomes clear from what has been shown already about the meaning of birds and beasts - about birds in <a href="40.htm">40</a>, and above at verses 14, 15, of this chapter, and about beasts as well in those same verses, and also in <a href="45.htm">45</a>, <a href="46.htm">46</a>, <a href="142.htm">142</a>, <a href="143.htm">143</a>, <a href="246.htm">246</a>. Since birds mean intellectual concepts, rational concepts, and factual knowledge, they also mean 
things that are the contrary, such as perverted rational concepts, falsities, and affections for falsity. The persuasions of the people before the Flood are described fully here, that is to say, they 
had within them affections for falsity, evil desires, pleasures, and bodily and earthly interests. All of these things are present in persuasions, though a person is not directly conscious of this, for 
he imagines that a false assumption, or persuasion of falsity, is some uncomplicated or quite general entity. He is much mistaken however, for the situation is altogether different. Every one of a 
person's affections derives its existence and character from the things of his understanding and at the same time from those of his will. As a result the whole person as regards all things of his understanding 
and all those of his will is present in every one of his affections, indeed in the most individual or least parts of them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This has been made quite clear to me from many experiences. 
For example, to mention but one, a spirit in the next life is able to recognize a person's character from merely one idea in that person's thinking. Indeed angels have the ability from the Lord to know 
anyone's character in an instant by merely looking at him; and they never make a mistake. From this it is clear that every one of a person's ideas, every affection, indeed every least part of his affection, 
is an image and replica of himself. That is, it contains something, closely or remotely, of the whole of his understanding and of the whole of his will. This then is how the dreadful persuasions 
of the people before the Flood are described: They had within them affections for falsity, also affections for evil (which are evil desires), as well as pleasures, and last of all bodily and earthly 
interests. All of these are present within such persuasions; and not only within persuasions in general but also within the most individual or least parts of persuasions, in which bodily and earthly 
interests are predominant. If anyone knew how much one false assumption or one persuasion of falsity contained he would be horrified. It is in a way an image of hell. But if they are the product of 
innocence or of ignorance, those falsities in him are easily dispersed. </p>

'Quoad avem, et quoad bestiam, et quoad feram, et quoad omne reptile reptans super terra': quod significent persuasiones eorum, quibus 'aves' affectiones falsi, 'bestia' cupiditates, 'fera' voluptates, 
'reptile reptans' corporea et terrestria, constare potest ex illis quae prius de significatione avium et bestiarum ostensa sunt; de avibus, n. 40, et supra ad vers. 14, 15, hujus capitis; de bestiis 
etiam ibi, tum n. 45, 46, 142, 143, 246. 'Aves' quia intellectualia, rationalia et scientifica significant, (x)etiam significant contraria, ut perversa rationalia, falsa, et affectiones falsi.  Persuasiones 
antediluvianorum hic plene describuntur, nempe quod in illis affectiones falsi, cupiditates, voluptates, corporea et terrestria; omnia haec insunt persuasionibus, quod homo nescit, putans principium 
falsi seu persuasionem falsi esse modo simplex quoddam aut unum commune quoddam, sed multum fallitur, prorsus aliter se res habet; unaquaevis affectio hominis trahit suam existentiam et naturam 
ex ejus intellectualibus et simul ex ejus voluntariis, ita ut totus homo quoad omnia sua intellectualia et omnia sua voluntaria sit	unaquavis ejus affectione, immo in affectionis ejus singularissimis 
seu minimus; [2] quod constare mihi potuit manifeste a pluribus experientiis, ut memorem solum id, quod spiritus in altera vita ex modo unica idea cogitationis ejus cognosci possit qualis est, immo 
angeli a Domino habent, ut cum modo inspiciunt in aliquem, norunt ilico qualis est, nec fallit quicquam; inde constat quod unaquaevis hominis idea, et quod unaquaevis affectio, immo unumquodvis minimum 
ejus affectionis, sit imago ejus et effigies ejus, hoc est, quod eis insit aliquid proxime et remote ab omni ejus intellectuali et ab omni ejus voluntario. Ita nunc descriptae sunt antediluvianorum 
dirae persuasiones, quod in iis fuerint affectiones falsi, tum affectiones mali seu cupiditates, ut et voluptates, demum corporea et terrestria; omnia haec insunt talibus persuasionibus, et non solum 
persuasionibus in communi, sed etiam persuasionum singularissimis seu minimus, in quibus corporea et terrestria dominantur: si sciret homo quantum uni principio falsi ac uni persuasioni falsi insit, 
horresceret; est quaedam imago inferni: sed si ex innocentia aut ex ignorantia, falsa ibi facile discutiuntur. </p>
