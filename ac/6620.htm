<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6620节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6620.</strong>由此可知，圣言的每一个事物也含有无限细节在里面。因为圣言是从主经由天堂降下来的。然而，在那些观念已关闭的人看来，圣言似乎极其简单，并不复杂。我曾与否认圣言里面藏有任何事物的灵人谈论这个话题。我说，有无限且无法描述的事物存在于圣言中，它们无法被那些观念关闭的人感知到。因此，我说，这种人除了字义外什么也不接受；他们把字义解释得符合他们预先设想的观念和自己的欲望，由此关闭了通往隐藏在圣言里面之物的道路；对于自己的任何观念，他们要么清空，要么严严地封锁起来。这时，一个思维观念在封闭时是什么样，在打开时又是什么样，也得到证明；因为这在天堂之光中是很容易证明的。被封闭的观念看似一个黑点，里面什么也看不见；而打开的观念就像一片光明，里面有如同火焰般的某种事物，一切具体事物都仰望这个事物。火焰代表主，仰望祂的事物代表天堂；据说，从主所领受的每个观念都包含整个天堂的形像，因为它来自系天堂的主。</p>

From all this it may be known how infinite are the contents also in everything of the Word (for the Word descends from the Lord through heaven), although it appears to those whose ideas have been closed, 
as a very simple thing. On this subject I once talked with spirits who denied that anything lies hidden in the Word; and I said that there are infinite and unutterable things therein, which cannot 
be perceived by those whose ideas are closed, and who admit nothing but the literal sense, which they interpret in favor of their own principles and cupidities, and thereby close to themselves access 
to what is stored within, and they either empty out their own ideas, or else close them tight. There was then also shown how an idea of thought appears when it has been enclosed, and how when it has 
been opened, for this can be easily shown in the light of heaven: the closed idea appeared like a black point, in which nothing was visible; but the opened idea appeared like a light in which there was 
something as of flame, and toward which everything there looked. The flame represented the Lord, and the things that looked to Him represented heaven; and it was said that in every idea which is from 
the Lord, there is an image of the whole heaven, because it is from Him who is heaven. </p>

From all this one may now know that every item in the Word also holds infinite details within it, for the Word has come down from the Lord by way of heaven. Yet to those whose ideas are closed it seems 
to be utterly simple, without complexity. I once talked about this matter to spirits who refused to accept that anything lies concealed inwardly in the Word. I said that things infinite and indescribable 
were present within it that are indiscernible by those who possess ideas that are closed. As a consequence, I said, such people accept nothing else than the literal sense, which they interpret 
to suit their own pre-conceived ideas and own desires, and in so doing they block off access to what lies concealed within the Word; and as for any ideas they do have, they either rid themselves of them 
or lock them away. What an idea looks like when it is closed, and what it looks like when open, was also demonstrated at this time; for this is easy to demonstrate in the light of heaven. A closed 
idea appeared looking like a black spot in which nothing else could be seen; but an open idea looked like an area of light in which there was so to speak a fiery glow towards which every particular thing 
there was directed. The fiery glow represented the Lord, and the things looking towards it represented heaven. It was said that every idea received from the Lord contains an image of the entire heaven, 
because it comes from Him who is heaven. </p>

Ex illis {1}sciri potest quam infinita quoque insunt unicuique rei Verbi, nam hoc a Domino per caelum descendit, tametsi illud apparet iis quibus clausae sunt ideae, sicut simplicissimum.  De hac re 
quondam locutus sum cum spiritibus qui negarunt aliquid intus in Verbo latere, et dicebam quod infinita (c)et ineffabilia inibi essent quae ab illis non {2}possunt percipi qui habent ideas clausas, quare 
{3}non aliud quam sensum litteralem admittunt, quem interpretantur ad favorem suorum principiorum et cupiditatum, et sic praecludunt sibi aditum ad illa quae inibi recondita sunt, ac ipsas suas ideas 
vel exinaniunt vel compingunt.  Tunc quoque {4}ostendebatur qualis idea cogitationis apparet cum clausa est, et qualis cum aperta, hoc enim in luce caeli {5}facile ostendi potest; idea clausa apparuit 
instar puncti nigri in quo non aliquid visibile; at idea aperta sicut lucidum in quo velut flammeum ad quod singula ibi spectabant; flammeum repraesentabat Dominum, et quae ad illum spectabant, 
repraesentabant caelum; et dictum quod in unaquavis idea quae a Domino, sit imago totius caeli, quia ab Ipso Qui est caelum. @1 constare$ @2 possent$ @3 nec$ @4 ostensum$ @5 manifeste$ </p>
