<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9470节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9470.</strong>“母山羊毛”表由此而来的良善，也就是说，来自相爱之良善的良善。“母山羊毛”之所以表示这种良善，是因为“母山羊”表示外在人或属世人中的纯真之良善（参看<a href="3519.htm">3519</a>，<a href="7840.htm">7840</a>节）；“羊毛”表示属于该良善的真理。然而，由于此处所表示的是良善，而非真理，所以原文其实没有说“母山羊毛”，只说“母山羊”，在其它地方也是这种情况，如下列出埃及记的经文：<br />凡手艺精巧的妇女把所纺的蓝色、紫色、染过两次的朱红色线和细麻都拿了来。凡有智慧心里受感的妇女就纺母山羊。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出35.25.htm">35:25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出35.26.htm">26</a>）<br />“纺母山羊”表示由母山羊毛所织成的东西。<br />“羊毛”表示来自一个属天源头的真理，这真理本身是良善，这一点从圣言中提到它的经文明显看出来，如何西阿书：<br />他们的母亲行了淫乱。她说，我要随从我所爱的，我的饼、水、羊毛、麻都是他们给的。因此，到了收割的时候，我必回来收回我的五谷，也必将我的羊毛和麻夺回来。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何2.5.htm">2:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/何2.9.htm">9</a>）<br />此处论述的是一个败坏的教会，它在此被称为“母亲”；经上所说的与她行淫乱的“所爱的”是指那些扭曲良善和真理的人；“饼和水”表示爱的内在良善和信的内在真理；“羊毛”和“麻”所表相同，不过是外在的。<br />但以理书：<br />我观看，直到宝座设立，上头坐着亘古常在者，祂的衣服洁白如雪，头发如纯净的羊毛。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.9.htm">7:9</a>）<br />这论及就一切信之真理而言已经荒废，然后又被主恢复的教会；“宝座设立”表示它已完全荒废；“亘古常在者”是指属天良善方面的主，就是诸如存在于上古教会中的属天良善，上古教会是一个属天教会。在圣言中，属天良善被称为“亘古”，“洁白如雪”的衣服表示它的外在真理；“如纯净羊毛”的头发表示它的外在良善。类似的话出现在启示录：<br />七灯台中间有一位好像人子。祂的头与发皆白，如白羊毛、如雪。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.13.htm">1:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.14.htm">14</a>）<br />这种真理本身是良善，因为它是属天良善的外在形式；在这些经文中，“羊毛”也表示这种真理：<br />大马色人就拿黑本酒和察哈尔羊毛与你交易。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.18.htm">27:18</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />你们的罪虽像染过两次的，必变白如雪；虽红如朱红，必如羊毛。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛1.18.htm">1:18</a>）<br />由于亚伦的衣服代表诸如属于主的属灵国度的那类事物，因而代表属于真理的属灵事物，所以他的“圣衣”是亚麻布，而不是羊毛制成的；因为“亚麻布”是指属灵真理，而“羊毛”是指属天真理，相比之下，这真理是良善。因此，经上在以西结书中说：<br />祭司利未人撒督的子孙，他们进内院门必穿亚麻衣；羊毛必不临到他们身上。他们头上要戴细麻布裹头巾，腰穿细麻布裤子。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结44.15.htm">44:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结44.17.htm">17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结44.18.htm">18</a>）<br />亚伦的衣服不是由羊毛，而是由亚麻布制成的，这一点从利未记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.4.htm">16:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.32.htm">32</a>）清楚看出来。<br />由此可见，“亚麻布”表示属灵真理，也就是信之良善的真理；而“羊毛”表示属天真理，也就是爱之良善的真理。由于那些被赋予后一种真理的人无法被赋予前一种真理，故经上规定不可穿羊毛、亚麻布搀杂做的衣服（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申22.11.htm">22:11</a>）。属天之物和属灵之物之间就存在这种区别，这二者无法在同一个人里面在一起（参看<a href="9277.htm">9277</a>节所引用的地方）。</p>

And goats' wool. That this signifies the good thence derived, namely, from the good of mutual love, is evident from the signification of a "she-goat," as being the good of innocence in the external or 
natural man (see n. 3519, 7840); and from the signification of the "wool" thereof, as being the truth of this good. But as good is here signified, and not truth, therefore in the original tongue it 
is not said "goats' wool," but only "goats," as also in other passages; as in the following in Exodus: </p>
<p>     All the women that were wise brought that which they had spun, the blue, the crimson, the scarlet 
double-dyed, the fine linen. And they whose heart stirred them up, spun goats (Exod. 35:25, 26); </p>
<p>"to spin goats" denotes what was made from the wool of goats. [2] But that "wool" denotes truth 
from a celestial origin, which in itself is good, is evident from the passages in the Word where it is mentioned; as in Hosea: </p>
<p>     She said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my 
water, my wool and my flax. Therefore will I return, and take my grain in its time, and will rescue My wool and My flax (Hos. 2:5, 9); </p>
<p>the perverted church is here treated of, which is here called the 
"mother;" the "lovers" with whom she is said to have "committed whoredom," denote those who pervert goods and truths; "bread and water" denote the internal goods of love and truths of faith; "wool 
and flax" denote the same, but external. [3] In Daniel: </p>
<p>     I beheld till the thrones were cast forth, and the Ancient of Days did sit; His garment was like the white snow, and the hair of His head 
was like the clean wool (Dan. 7:9); </p>
<p>the vastation of the church in respect to all the truth of faith, and its restoration by the Lord, are here treated of; a complete vastation is signified by "the 
thrones being cast forth;" "the Ancient of Days" denotes the Lord as to celestial good, such as was in the Most Ancient Church, which was a celestial church, and which in the Word is called "ancient;" 
its external truth is signified by the "garment that was like the white snow;" and its external good by the "hair of the head that was like the clean wool." In like manner in John: </p>
<p>     In the midst 
of the seven lampstands was one like to the Son of man; His head and His hair were white as white wool, as snow (Rev. 1:13, 14). [4] Such truth, which being a form of celestial good, is in itself good, 
is also signified by "wool" in these passages: </p>
<p>Damascus was thy merchant in wine of Helbon, and wool of Zachar (Ezek. 27:18).      Though your sins be as double-dyed, they shall be as white as snow; 
though they be red like scarlet, they shall be as wool (Isa. 1:18). [5] As by the garments of Aaron were represented such things as belong to the Lord's spiritual kingdom, thus the spiritual things 
of truth, his garments of holiness were of linen, and not of wool; for "linen" denotes spiritual truth, but "wool" celestial truth, which relatively is good. For this reason it is said in Ezekiel: </p>
<p> 
    The priests, the Levites, the sons of Zadok, when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall put on garments of linen; and no wool shall come upon them. Linen turbans shall be upon 
their heads, breeches of linen upon their loins (Ezek. 44:15, 17, 18). That the garments of Aaron also were not of wool, but of linen, is evident from Leviticus 16:4, 32. [6] From all this it can 
be seen that "linen" signifies spiritual truth, which is the truth of the good of faith; but that "wool" signifies celestial truth, which is the truth of the good of love; and as those who are in the 
latter truth cannot be in the former truth, for the two differ as do the light from the sun and the light from the stars, therefore it was decreed that "a mixed garment of wool and linen was not to be 
worn" (Deut. 22:11). (That there is such a distinction between the celestial and the spiritual, and that the two are not together in one subject, see the citations in n. 9277.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9470</b></p><p><b>9470.</b>
'And wool of she-goats' means the good from this, that is to say, from the good of mutual love. The reason why 'wool of she-goats' means this good is that 'a she-goat' means the good of innocence in 
the external or natural man, <a href="3519.htm">3519</a>, <a href="7840.htm">7840</a>, and therefore 'wool' means the truth belonging to that good. However, since not truth but good is meant, the original language does not actually say 'wool of she-goats', 
only 'she-goats', as is also the case in other places, such as in the following words in Exodus,  </p>
<blockquote>
All the skilled<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> women brought what they had spun, violet, purple, twice-dyed scarlet, [and] 
fine linen thread; and all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun she-goats. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2035:25,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 35:25, 26</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Spinning she-goats' stands for producing things woven from the wool of she-goats. 
 </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that 'wool' means truth from a celestial origin, which in itself is good, is clear from places in the Word where the actual word is used, as in Hosea,  </p>
<blockquote>
[Their mother has committed 
whoredom.] She said, I will go after my lovers, those giving me my bread and my water, my wool and my linen. Therefore I will return and take back My grain in its season, and I will snatch away My wool 
and My linen. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%202:5,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 2:5, 9</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to a corrupted Church, meant here by 'mother'. 'The lovers' with whom she is said to have committed whoredom are those who pervert forms of good and truths. 
'Bread' and 'water' mean internal forms of the good of love, and the internal truths of faith; 'wool' and 'flax' mean external ones.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Daniel,  </p>
<blockquote>
I saw until thrones were placed, and the 
Ancient of Days was seated. His clothing was white as snow, and the hair of His head like pure wool. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%207:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 7:9</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Church laid waste so far as every truth of faith was concerned, and 
then restored by the Lord, its having been completely laid waste being meant in the words 'thrones were placed'. 'The Ancient of Days' is the Lord in respect of celestial good as this existed in the 
Most Ancient Church, which was a celestial Church. In the Word that good is called 'ancient', its external truth being meant by clothing which was 'white as snow', and its external good by hair of the 
head which was 'like pure wool'. Similar words occur in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
... in the midst of the seven lampstands one like the Son of Man. His head and hair were white, like white wool, like snow. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%201:13,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 1:13, 14</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 This kind of truth, being in itself good because it is the outward form of celestial good, is again meant by 'wool' in Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
Damascus was your merchant in the wine of Helbon and 
the wool of Zachar.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2027:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 27:18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Though your sins are like twice-dyed, they will be as white as snow. Though they are as red as scarlet, they will be as wool. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%201:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 1:18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
Because Aaron's garments represented the kinds of realities that belong to the Lord's spiritual kingdom, thus the spiritual realities that belong to truth, his 'holy garments' were made of linen and 
not of wool. For 'linen' is spiritual truth, whereas 'wool' is celestial truth, which in comparison is good. On this account it says in Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
The priests, the Levites, the sons of Zadok, when 
they enter the gates of the inner court they shall put on the linen garments, and no wool shall come upon them. The linen turbans shall be on their heads, the linen undergarments shall be over their 
loins. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2044:17,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 44:17, 18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The fact that Aaron's garments were made not of wool but of linen is clear from <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2016:4,%2032&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 16:4, 32</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 From all this it becomes clear that 'linen' means spiritual truth, which 
is the truth of the good of faith, whereas 'wool' means celestial truth, which is the truth of the good of love. And since those endued with the latter kind of truth cannot be endued with the former, 
because the two are as different as the light of the sun is from the light of the stars, it was laid down that no one should wear a garment made of wool and linen mixed together, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2022:10,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 22:10, 11</a>. 
The fact that between what is celestial and what is spiritual there is such a difference, and that both cannot be together in one and the same person, see the places referred to in <a href="9277.htm">9277</a>.

`Et lana caprarum': quod significet bonum inde, nempe ex bono amoris mutui; quod `lana caprarum' id bonum sit, est qui; `capra' significat bonum innocentiae in externo seu naturali homine n. 3519, 7840, 
ac inde `lana' est verum boni illius; {1}sed quoniam non verum sed bonum significatur, ideo in lingua originali non dicitur lana caprarum, sed solum caprae, sicut etiam alibi, ut iri sequentibus in 
Exodo, 	Omnes mulieres sapientes attulerunt netum, hyacinthinum purpuram, coccineum dibaphum, byssinum; et omnes mulieres quas impulit, cor (c)illarum in sapientia, neverunt capras, xxxv 25, 26; </p>
<p>`nere 
capras' pro texta ex lana caprarum. 	2 Quod autem `lana' sit verum ex origine caelesti, quod in se est bonum, constat ex locis in Verbo ubi nominatur, ut apud Hoscheam, 	Dixit, Ibo post amasios 
meos, dantes panem meum et aquas meas, lanam meam et linum meum: ideo revertar, et accipiam frumentum meum in tempore suo, et eripiam lanam meam et linum meum,ii 5,9; </p>
<p>agitur ibi de Ecclesia perversa, 
quae ibi `mater'; 'amasii' cum quibus dicitur scortata, sunt qui pervertunt bona et vera, `panis et aquae' sunt bona amoris et vera fidei interna, `lana et linum' sunt eadem sed externa: apud Danielem, 	Videns 
fui usque dum throni projecti sunt, et antiquus dierum sedit; vestis ejus sicut nix alba, et crinis capitis ejus sicut lana munda, vii 9; </p>
<p>agitur ibi de vastatione Ecclesiae quoad omne verum 
fidei, et de restauratione ejus a Domino; vastatio plenaria significatur per quod throni projecti sint; `antiquus dierum' est Dominus quoad bonum caeleste {2} quale fuit in antiquissima Ecclesia, 
quae Ecclesia caelestis fuit, et in Verbo `antiquum' vocatur; ejus verum externum significatur per `vestem quae sicut nix alba,' et ejus bonum externum significatur per `crinem capitis qui sicut lana 
munda': similiter apud Johannem, 	In medio septem candelabrorum similis Filio hominis, caput Ejus et capilli albi sicut lana alba, sicut nix, Apoc. i 13, 14. Tale verum, quod quia est forma boni caelestis, 
in se est bonum, 4 etiam {3}per `lanam' significatur apud Ezechielem, 	Damascus negotiatrix tua in vino {4}Chelbonis et lana Zacharis, xxvii 18: </p>
<p>et apud Esaiam, 	Si fuerint peccata vestra sicut 
dibapha, sicut nix albescent; si rubra fuerint sicut coccinum, sicut lana erunt, i 18. Quoniam per vestes Aharonis repraesentabantur talia quae sunt 5 regni spiritualis Domini, ita spiritualia quae 
sunt veri, ideo vestes sanctitatis ejus erant ex lino et non ex lana; linum enim est spirituale verum, lana autem caeleste verum, quod respective est bonum; ob illam causam (x)dicitur apud Ezechielem, 	Sacerdotes 
Levitae, filii Zadochi, quando intrabunt ad portas atrii interioris, vestes lini induent, nec ascendet super eos lana; cidares lini erunt super capite corum, femoralia lini erunt super 
lumbis eorum, xliv 17, 18; </p>
<p>quod {5} vestes Aharonis non ex lana sed ex lino fuerint, constat {6}ex Lev. xvi 4, 32; ex his constare potest quod `linum' significet verum 6 spirituale quod est verum 
boni fidei, `lana' autem verum caeleste quod est verum boni amoris; et quoniam illi qui in hoc vero sunt non possunt esse in illo vero, differunt enim sicut lux ex sole, et lux ex stellis; ideo {7}statutum 
erat quod non indueretur vestis mixta ex lana et lino simul, Deut. xxii 10, 11; quod inter caeleste et spirituale tale discrimen sit, et quod utrumque in uno subjecto non simul sint, videantur citata
