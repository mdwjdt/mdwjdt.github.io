<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4235节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4235.</strong>“神的使者遇见他”表出自良善的启示。这从“神的使者”的含义清楚可知，“神的使者”是指主之神性的某个方面，在此是指主里面的神性，因为被称为父的神性本身在主里面。主的生命本质（这生命本质在人里面被称为灵魂）就来自神性，就是祂自己。这种神性通常被称作神性性质（Divine nature），确切地说，被称为主的神性本质（Divine essence）。因为在圣言中，“神的使者（或天使）”表示主的某个方面（参看<a href="1925.htm">1925</a>，<a href="2319.htm">2319</a>，<a href="2821.htm">2821</a>，<a href="3039.htm">3039</a>，<a href="4085.htm">4085</a>节）。“神的使者遇见他”在最近似意义上表示神性进入属世层的流注，以及由此所带来的启示；因为一切启示皆出自神性流注。由于所论述的主题是主的属世层里面状态的颠倒，以便良善能占据第一位，真理占据第二位；还由于本章这第一部分所论述的主题是在属世层里面真理植入良善（<a href="4232.htm">4232</a>节），又由于这一切若没有来自神性的启示，是根本不可能实现的，故此处首先论述由真理将要被植入其中的良善所带来的启示</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4235</b></p><p><b>4235.</b>
And the angels of God ran to meet him. That this signifies enlightenment from good, is evident from the signification of the "angels of God," as being something of the Lord; here, the Divine which was 
in the Lord; for in the Lord was the Divine Itself which is called the "Father." The very essence of life (which in man is called the soul) was therefrom, and was Himself. This Divine is what is called 
in common speech the Divine nature, or rather the Lord's Divine essence. (That something of the Divine of the Lord is signified in the Word by the "angels of God," may be seen above, n. 1925, 2319, 
2821, 3039, 4085.) By "the angels of God running to meet him" is signified in the proximate sense the influx of the Divine into the natural, and the consequent enlightenment; for all enlightenment is 
from the influx of the Divine. As the subject treated of is the inversion of state in the Lord's natural, in order that good might be in the first place, and truth in the second; and as the subject 
treated of in this first part of the chapter is the implantation of truth in good therein (n. 4232), and as this could not be effected without enlightenment from the Divine, therefore the first thing 
treated of is the enlightenment effected by the good into which truth was to be implanted. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4235</b></p><p><b>4235.</b>
'And the angels of God met him' means enlightenment coming from good. This is clear from the meaning of 'the angels of God' as some aspect of the Lord, in this case the Divine which is within the Lord, 
for within the Lord there was the Divine itself which is called the Father. The very Essence of the Lord's life, which with man is termed the soul, was from the Divine and was Himself. That Divine 
is what is normally referred to as the Divine Nature, or rather the Lord's Divine Essence. For in the Word 'the angels of God' means some aspect of the Lord's Divine, see <a href="1925.htm">1925</a>, <a href="2319.htm">2319</a>, <a href="2821.htm">2821</a>, <a href="3039.htm">3039</a>, <a href="4085.htm">4085</a>. 
This statement about the angels of God meeting him means in the proximate sense an inflowing of the Divine into the Natural, which brought enlightenment; for all enlightenment comes about from an influx 
of the Divine. As the subject is a turning round of the state within the Lord's Natural, so that good came to occupy the first place and truth the second, and the implanting of truth within good there, 
dealt with in <a href="4232.htm">4232</a>; and as this could not be effected without enlightenment from the Divine, enlightenment from the good in which the truth was to be implanted is here dealt with first. </p>

`Et occurrerunt in eum angeli Dei': quod significet illustrationem a bono, constat a significatione `angelorum Dei' quod sit aliquid Domini, hic Divinum {1} quod in Domino, nam in Domino fuit Ipsum 
Divinum quod `Pater' vocatur; ipsa Essentia vitae [Domini,] quae apud hominem {2} dicitur anima, fuit inde, et fuit Ipse; illud Divinum est quod in communi sermone vocatur Natura Divina, potius 
Essentia Divina Domini; quod per `angelos (o)Dei' in Verbo aliquid Divini Domini significetur, videatur n. 1925, 2319, 2822, 3039, 4085: per quod `angeli Dei occurrerunt {3} in eum' significatur in 
sensu proximo `influxus Divini' in Naturale, inde illustratio, nam omnis illustratio est ab influxu Divini.  Quia de inversione status in Naturali Domini, ut bonum primo loco esset, et verum secundo, 
et hic de implantatione veri in bono ibi, agitur n. 4232, et id absque illustratione a Divino non fieri potuit, ideo hic primum agitur de illustratione a bono, in quo verum implantaretur.     
 @1 aliquod Divinum quod Domini, hic$      @2 homines$      @3 angeli occurrerint$ </p>
