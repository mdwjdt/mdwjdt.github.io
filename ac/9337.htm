<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9337节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9337.</strong>“等到你多结果实”表照良善的增长。这从“多结果实”的含义清楚可知，“多结果实”是指良善的增长（参看<a href="43.htm">43</a>，<a href="55.htm">55</a>，<a href="913.htm">913</a>，<a href="983.htm">983</a>，<a href="2846.htm">2846</a>，<a href="2847.htm">2847</a>节）。邪恶和虚假的移走照良善的增长而实现，这一点从前面频繁的说明清楚看出来。主通过良善流入一个人，并通过它将真理排列有序，但反过来不行；真理在何等程度上通过良善被排列有序，邪恶和虚假就在何等程度上被移走。圣言处处将人比作一棵树，叶子表示他的信之真理（<a href="885.htm">885</a>节），果实则表示他的爱之良善（<a href="3146.htm">3146</a>，<a href="7690.htm">7690</a>节）。由此明显可知，不仅“多结果实”表示良善的增长，而且良善也是一个人最重要的特征，就像果实是一棵树最重要的特征一样。诚然，先长出来的，是叶子，但叶子是为了作为目的的果实而长出来的。作为目的的东西不仅是末后的，也是首先的，因为它是手段里面所关注的唯一事物，因而它是全部。爱之良善和信之真理的关系也是这种情况。<br />这就是“无花果树”的含义，对此，我们在下列经文中读到：<br />回城的时候，耶稣饿了。看见路旁有一棵无花果树，就走到跟前，在树上找不着什么，只有叶子。就对树说，从今以后，你永不再结果子。那无花果树就立刻枯干了！（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.18.htm">21:18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.19.htm">19</a>）<br />路加福音：<br />一个人有一棵无花果树栽在葡萄园里。他来，在树上找果子，却找不着。就对管葡萄园的说，看哪，我这三年来在这无花果树上找果子，竟找不着。把它砍了吧，何必使地不结果呢！（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.6.htm">13:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.7.htm">7</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />凡树木凭它的果子就可以认出来。人不是从荆棘上收无花果，也不是从蒺藜里收葡萄。善人从他心里的善之库房就发出善来；恶人从他心里的恶之库房就发出恶来。你们为什么称呼我主啊，主啊，却不遵我的话行呢？（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路6.44.htm">6:44</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路6.46.htm">46</a>）<br />由此明显可知，信的果子，如它被称呼的，是信最重要的方面或说首要事物；没有果子，也就是没有生活良善的信只是叶子；因此，当此处“树”所表示的人长满叶子，却没有果实时，他就是那枯干并被砍掉的无花果树。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9337</b></p><p><b>9337.</b>
Until thou be fruitful. That this signifies according to the increase of good, is evident from the signification of "being fruitful," as being the increase of good (see n. 43, 55, 913, 983, 2846, 2847). 
That removal from evils and falsities is effected according to the increase of good, is evident from what has been frequently shown above; for the Lord flows into man by means of good, and by means 
of it He disposes truth into order; but not the converse; and insofar as truths are disposed into order by means of good, so far evils and falsities are removed. In the Word throughout man is likened 
to a tree, and his truths of faith are signified by the leaves (n. 885), and his goods of love by the fruits (n. 3146, 7690). From this it is plain not only that "to be fruitful" denotes an increase 
of good; but also that good is man's chief thing, even as the fruit is the chief thing of a tree. The leaves are indeed put forth first, but for the sake of the fruit as the end. That which is the end 
is not only the last, but it is also the first thing, because it is the one and only thing regarded in the means, thus it is everything. The case is similar with the good of love relatively to the truths 
of faith. [2] Such was the signification of "a fig-tree," of which we read in the following passages: </p>
<p>     As Jesus returned to the city, He hungered. And seeing a fig-tree in the way, He came 
to it, but found nothing thereon, except leaves only; and He said unto it, Let no fruit grow from thee henceforward forever; whereupon the fig-tree withered away (Matt. 21:18, 19).      A certain man 
had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard; he came therefore seeking fruit thereon, but found none; he said therefore unto the vinedresser, Behold these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree, 
but find none: cut it down; why rendereth it the land unfruitful? (Luke 13:6, 7).      Every tree is known by its fruit. Of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes. 
The good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; but the evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil. Why call ye Me, Lord, Lord, 
and do not the things which I say? (Luke 6:44-46.) From all this it is evident that the fruit of faith, as it is called, is the primary thing of faith; and that faith without fruit, that is, without 
the good of life, is only a leaf; and thus that when a man (here meant by "the tree") abounds in leaves without fruit, he is the fig-tree which withers away and is cut down. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9337</b></p><p><b>9337.</b>
'Until you become fruitful' means in keeping with the increase of good. This is clear from the meaning of 'becoming fruitful' as the increase of good, dealt with in <a href="43.htm">43</a>, <a href="55.htm">55</a>, <a href="913.htm">913</a>, <a href="983.htm">983</a>, <a href="2846.htm">2846</a>, <a href="2847.htm">2847</a>. The 
fact that a removal from evils and falsities is accomplished in keeping with the increase of good is evident from things that have often been shown before. The Lord flows in with a person through good, 
and arranges truths into order through it, but not vice versa; and to the extent that truths are arranged into order through good, evils and falsities are removed. Various places in the Word liken a 
person to a tree; and in those places his truths of faith are meant by 'the leaves', <a href="885.htm">885</a>, and forms of the good of love by 'the fruit', <a href="3146.htm">3146</a>, <a href="7690.htm">7690</a>. From this it is evident not only that 'becoming fruitful' 
means the increase of good but also that the most important feature of a person is good, just as the most important feature of a tree is the fruit. The leaves, it is true, grow first, but they 
do so for the sake of the fruit as the end in view. That which is the end is not only last but also first since it is the one and only thing in view within the means, making it the be-all. The situation 
is similar with the relationship of the good of love to the truths of faith.  </p>

 Such was meant by 'the fig tree' referred to in Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus returning to the city was hungry, and seeing 
a fig tree by the wayside went to it but found nothing on it but leaves only; therefore He said to it, Let no fruit from now on ever be born from you! Therefore the fig tree withered at once. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2021:18,%2019&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 21:18, 19</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And in Luke,  </p>
<blockquote>
A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; therefore he came seeking fruit on it, but did not find [any]. Consequently he said to the vine-dresser, Behold, for 
three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, but do not find [any]. Cut it down; why must it make the land unfruitful?<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2013:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 13:6, 7</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Again in the same gospel,  </p>
<blockquote>
Every tree is known by its 
own fruit; people do not collect figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble-bush. A good person out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good, but a bad person out of the bad 
treasure of his heart brings forth bad. Why do you call Me, Lord, Lord, and do not do what I say? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%206:44-46&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 6:44-46</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>From these quotations it is evident that the fruit of faith, as it is termed, is 
the most important aspect of faith, and that faith devoid of fruit, that is, of the good of life, is mere foliage, and that therefore when a person, who is a tree, is covered with leaves but devoid of 
fruit, he is the fig tree that withers and is cut down.

`Usque dum fructificeris':  quod significet secundum incrementum boni, constat ex significatione `fructificari' quod sit incrementum boni, de qua n. 43, 55, 913, 983, 2846, 2847.  Quod remotio a malis 
et falsis fiat secundum incrementum boni, patet ab illis quae prius saepe ostensa sunt; Dominus enim per bonum influit apud hominem, et per illud disponit vera in ordinem, non autem vice versa; et 
quantum vera per bonum disponuntur in ordinem, tantum mala et falsa {1} removentur.  (s)Homo in Verbo passim assimilatur arbori, `et tunc ejus fidei vera significantur per folia, n. 885, ac bona amoris 
per fractus, n. 3146, 7690; inde patet non solum quod `fructificari' sit incrementum boni sed etiam quod praecipuum hominis sit bonum, sicut praecipuum arboris est fructus; folia quidem primum enascuntur, 
sed propter fructum ut finem; quod finis est, hoc non solum ultimum est sed etiam primum, quoniam est in mediis unicum quod spectatur, ita omne; similiter se habet cum bono amoris respective ad 
vera fidei; [2] tale significatur per `ficum,' de qua apud Matthaeum, 	Jesus revertens in urbem esurivit, et videns ficum unam in via, venit ad eam, sed nihil invenit in ea nisi folia tantum, ideo dixit 
illi, Ne posthac ex te fructus nascatur in aeternum; unde arefacta est ex tempore ficus, xxi 18 [, 19]: </p>
<p>et apud Lucam, 	Ficum habebat aliquis in vinea sua plantatam; venit ergo fructum quaerens 
in ea sed non invenit; dixit itaque ad vinitorem, Ecce tres annos venio quaerens fructum in ficu hae, non autem invenio; exscinde illam; ut quid terram infrugiferam faciet? xiii 6, 7: </p>
<p>tum {3} apud eundem, 	Omnis 
arbor ex proprio fructu cognoscitur; non ex spinis colligunt ficus, neque ex rubo vindemiant uvam; bonus homo ex bono thesauro cordis sui profert bonum, (x)at pravum homo ex pravo thesauro 
cordis sui profert pravum.  Quid Me vocatis, Domine, Domine, et non facitis quae dico? vi 44-46. ex his patet quod fructus fidei, sicut vocatur, sit primarium fidei, et quod fides absque fructu, 
hoc est, absque bono (m)vitae, sit modo folium, et (o)sic quod homo qui arbor, luxurians foliis absque fructu, sit ficus quae exarescit {4} et exscinditur.(n)(s) @1 falsa et mala$ @2 et ejus vera fidei, 
significantur per ramos et folia, bona amoris autem per fructus, n. 885$ @3 et$ @4 arescit$ </p>
