<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2493节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2494.</strong>具有对主之爱和对邻之仁的人活在世上时，就有天使般的聪明智慧与他们同在，并存在于他们里面。不过，它被储存在其内部记忆的至内层。等到他们脱去肉体之物以前，这聪明智慧不可能向他们显明。一旦脱去肉体之物，上述对细节的记忆就会休眠；他们会醒来进入内部记忆，之后逐渐进入天使般的记忆本身。</p>

I have spoken with the angels concerning the memory of things past, and the consequent anxiety regarding things to come; and I have been instructed that the more interior and perfect the angels are, 
the less do they care for past things, and the less do they think of things to come; and also that from this comes their happiness. They say that the Lord gives them every moment what to think, and this 
with blessedness and happiness; and that they are thus free from cares and anxieties. Also, that this was meant in the internal sense by the manna being received daily from heaven; and by the daily 
bread in the Lord's Prayer; and likewise by the instruction not to be solicitous about what they should eat and drink, and wherewithal they should be clothed. But although the angels do not care for 
past things, and are not solicitous about things to come, they nevertheless have the most perfect recollection of past things, and the most perfect mental view of things to come; because in all their 
present there are both the past and the future. Thus they have a more perfect memory than can ever be thought of or expressed. </p>

I have spoken to angels about the memory of things of the past and about consequent anxiety concerning things of the future, and I have been informed that the more interior and perfect angels are the 
less do they care about things of the past or think about those of the future, and that this is also the origin of their happiness. They have said that the Lord provides them every moment with what to 
think, accompanied by blessing and happiness, and that this being so they have no cares and no worries. This also is what is meant in the internal sense by the manna being received 'day by day' from 
heaven, and by the 'daily [provision] of bread' in the Lord's Prayer, as well as by the statement that they must not worry about what they are to eat and drink, or what clothes they are to put on. But 
although angels have no care about things of the past and are not worried about those of the future they nevertheless have a most perfect recollection of things of the past and a most perfect insight 
into those of the future, because their entire present includes both the past and future within it. Thus they possess a more perfect memory than can possibly be imagined or put into words. </p>

</p><b>2493.</b>
Locutus cum angelis de memoria praeteritorum, et inde anxietate futurorum, et instructus sum quod quo interiores et perfectiores angeli sunt, eo minus praeterita curent et de futuris cogitent, et quod 
inde etiam felicitas eorum; dicendo quod Dominus iis quovis momento det quid cogitent, et hoc cum beato et felici, et quod sic absque curis et sollicitis sint, tum quod hoc in sensu interno intellectum 
sit per quod mannam `quotidie' acceperint e caelo et per `quotidianum' {1} panis in Oratione Domini; tum quod non solliciti erunt quid edant et bibant, et quibus vestiantur: at {2} tametsi praeterita 
non curant et de futuris non solliciti sunt, quod usque perfectissimam reminiscentiam praeteritorum et intuitionem futurorum habeant, quia in omni eorum praesenti inest tam praeteritum quam futurum; 
ita habent memoriam perfectiorem quam usquam cogitari et exprimi potest. 	@1 A had panem quotidianum but changed to quotidianum panis.$ 	@2 et.$ </p>
