<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8091.</strong>出埃及记13:17，18.法老容百姓去的时候，神却不领他们从非利士人之地的路走，虽然那里近，因为神说，恐怕百姓遇见打仗后悔，就回埃及去。所以神领百姓绕道而行，走红海旷野的路。以色列人出埃及地，都武装着上去。<br />“法老容百姓去的时候”表当那些侵扰的人离开那些属于属灵教会之人的时候。“神却不领他们从非利士人之地的路走”表神性确保他们不可转向并非源于良善的信之真理。“虽然那里近”表虽然它首先出现。“因为神说”表神性的预见。“恐怕百姓遇见打仗后悔”表他们会因攻击而偏离真理。“就回埃及去”表由此陷入与信之真理和良善完全对立的虚假。“所以神领百姓绕道而行，走旷野的路”表在神性指引之下，他们通过试探被引导确认或坚定接受信之真理和良善。“红海”表他们首先不得不经历的诅咒。“以色列人出埃及地，都武装着上去”表他们被带离侵扰的状态，由此准备经历试探。</p>

Verses 17, 18. And it was in Pharaoh's letting the people go, that God led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines, because that was near; for God said, Perchance the people will repent when 
they see war, and return to Egypt. And God led the people about, by the way of the wilderness, the sea Suph; and the sons of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt. "And it was in Pharaoh's 
letting the people go," signifies when they who had infested left those who were of the spiritual church; "that God led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines," signifies that it was provided 
by the Divine that they should not pass to truth of faith which is not from good; "because that was near," signifies that it first comes up; "for God said," signifies the Divine foresight; "Perchance 
the people will repent when they see war," signifies that they will turn aside from truth by reason of assaults; "and will return to Egypt," signifies that from this there would be a fall into falsities, 
which are utterly contrary to the truths and goods of faith; "and God led the people about, by the way of the wilderness," signifies that under the Divine auspices they were brought to confirm 
the truths and goods of faith through temptations; "the sea Suph," signifies the damnation which they were first to pass through; "and the sons of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt," signifies 
that they were taken away from a state of infestations, and thus prepared to undergo temptations. </p>

Verses 17,18 And so it was when Pharaoh sent the people away, that God did not lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, although<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> that was near; for God said, Perhaps the people will change 
their minds when they see war, and will return to Egypt. And God led the people around by the way of the wilderness, the Sea Suph. And the children of Israel went up equipped for battle, out of the 
land of Egypt. </p>
<p>'And so it was when Pharaoh sent the people away' means when those who molested left those belonging to the spiritual Church. 'That God did not lead them by the way of the land of the 
Philistines' means that the Divine saw to it that they should not pass on to the truth of faith that does not spring from good. 'Although that was near' means that this is the first to present itself. 
'For God said' means Divine foresight. 'Perhaps the people will change their minds when they see war' means that they will fall away from the truth as a result of attacks. 'And may return to Egypt' 
means a consequent relapse into falsities which are entirely opposed to the truths and forms of the good of faith. 'And God led the people around by the way of the wilderness' means that under Divine 
guidance they were led by means of temptations to firm acceptance of the truths and forms of the good of faith. 'The Sea Suph' means the damnation which they first had to pass through. 'And the children 
of Israel went up equipped for battle, out of the land of Egypt' means that they had been released from the state in which they underwent molestations and so had been made ready to suffer temptations.

Vers. 17, 18.  Et fuit in dimittere Pharao populum, et non duxit illos Deus via terrae Philistaeorum, quia propinqua illa, quia dixit Deus, Forte paenitebit populum in videre illos bellum, et revertentur 
Aegyptum.  Et circumduxit Deus populum via deserti, mare Suph; et accincti ascenderunt filii Israelis e terra Aegypti.  `Et fuit in dimittere Pharao populum' significat cum illi qui infestarunt 
relinquerent illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali: `et non duxit illos Deus via terrae Philistaeorum' significat quod a Divino provisum ne transirent ad verum fidei quod non ex bono: `quia propinqua illa' 
significat quod primum (x)obveniat: `quia dixit Deus' significat praevidentiam Divinam: `Forte paenitebit populum in videre illos bellum' significat quod a vero declinabunt per oppugnationes: `et revertatur 
Aegyptum' significat quod inde lapsus in falsa quae prorsus contra vera et bona fidei: `et circumduxit Deus populum via deserti' significat quod ex auspicio Divino perducti ad confirmanda vera 
et bona fidei per tentationes: mare Suph' significat damnationem quam primum transirent: `et accincti ascenderunt filii Israelis e terra Aegypti' significat quod ex statu infestationum exempti sint, 
et sic parati ad sustinendas tentationes. </p>
