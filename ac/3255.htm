<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3255节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3255.</strong>“（亚伯拉罕）被收殓归他本民那里”表这些事涉及亚伯拉罕。这从“被收殓归他本民那里”的含义清楚可知，“被收殓归他本民那里”是指不再是主题。事实上，被收殓归他本民那里是指离开那些一直与他同住的人，转到他自己人那里去，因而在此是指不再是一个代表。当有人死去时，古人习惯说，他被收殓归他祖先或本民那里。他们将这句话理解为，他正去往来世他父母、血亲和姻亲那里。这种说法是从属天的上古之人那里传下来的，因为他们在世时就与天上的天使同在，因而知道情况是怎么回事。也就是说，他们知道，凡具有相同良善的人都会在来世相遇并在一起，凡具有相同真理的人也一样。论到前者，他们声称他们“被收殓归他祖先那里”；而论到后者，则声称他们“被收殓归他本民那里”。因为对他们来说，“祖先”表良善（<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>节），“本民”表真理（<a href="1259.htm">1259</a>，<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>节）。由于上古教会之人都具有相同的良善，所以他们如今在天堂一起生活（<a href="1115.htm">1115</a>节）；古教会的许多人也是这种情况，他们具有相同的真理（<a href="1125.htm">1125</a>，<a href="1127.htm">1127</a>节）。<br />此外，人活在肉身时，就其灵魂而言，一直在来世的某个灵人社群（<a href="1277.htm">1277</a>，<a href="2379.htm">2379</a>节）。恶人在地狱灵人的社群，而善人在天使社群。因此，每个人都在诸如要么在良善与真理方面，要么在邪恶与虚假方面与其一致的那类灵人的社群中；并且死后他就进入这个社群（<a href="687.htm">687</a>节）。这些就是古人说他们被收殓归他们祖先那里，或归他们本民那里这句话所表示的事。这种说法在此用在了气绝的亚伯拉罕，以及本章以实玛利（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创25.17.htm">25:17</a>）身上，还用在以撒（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创35.29.htm">35:29</a>）、雅各（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.29.htm">49:29</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.33.htm">33</a>）、亚伦（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民20.24.htm">20:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民20.26.htm">26</a>）、摩西（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民27.13.htm">27:13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民31.2.htm">31:2</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.50.htm">32:50</a>）和进入迦南地的第一代人（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士2.10.htm">2:10</a>）身上。不过，就圣言的内义而言，当主题与人的生活是代表有关时，“被收殓归他本民那里”就表示他不再是主题，如前所述。</p>

And was gathered to his peoples. That this signifies that these things were concerning Abraham, is evident from the signification of being "gathered to his peoples," as being to be no longer the subject; 
for to be gathered to his peoples is to go away from those among whom he has been hitherto, and pass to his own; thus in the present case to be no longer a representative. It was customary with the 
ancients when anyone died, to say that he was gathered to his fathers or to his peoples, and they understood by this form of expression that he actually went to his parents, relations, and kinsfolk 
in the other life. They derived this form of speech from the most ancient people, who were celestial men, for while living on earth these were at the same time with the angels in heaven, and thus knew 
how the case is, namely, that all who are in the same good meet and are together in the other life, and likewise all who are in the same truth. Of the former they said that they were "gathered to their 
fathers," but of the latter that they were "gathered to their peoples;" for with them "fathers" signified goods (n. 2803), and "peoples" signified truths (n. 1259, 1260). As the people of the Most 
Ancient Church were all in similar good, they dwell together in heaven (n. 1115); and the case is the same with many of the people of the Ancient Church, who were in similar truth (n. 1125, 1127). [2] 
Moreover while a man lives in the body he is always as to his soul in some society of spirits in the other life (n. 1277, 2379); the man who is evil is in a society of infernal spirits; and the man 
who is good is in a society of angels. Thus everyone is in a society of such spirits as he is in agreement with, either as to good and truth, or as to evil and falsity; and into this same society the 
man comes when he dies (n. 687). This is what among the ancients was signified by being "gathered to their fathers," or "to their peoples," as is here said of Abraham when he expired, and of Ishmael 
in this same chapter (Gen. 25:17); of Isaac (Gen. 35:29); of Jacob (Gen. 49:29, 33); of Aaron (Num. 20:24, 26); of Moses (Num. 27:13; 31:2; Deut. 32:50); and of the first generation that entered into 
the land of Canaan (Judges 2:10). But in the internal sense of the Word, when anyone's life is treated of representatively, by being "gathered to his peoples" is signified that he is no longer the subject, 
as before said. </p>

'He was gathered to his peoples' means that these things involving Abraham [were completed]. This is clear from the meaning of 'being gathered to his peoples' as his ceasing to be the subject any longer. 
In fact being gathered to his peoples means taking leave of those among whom he had been until then, passing over to his own, and so here ceasing to represent. Among the ancients it was customary 
when somebody was dying to speak of his being gathered to his fathers or to his peoples. By this they meant that he was in the process of going to his parents, blood relatives, and relatives by marriage 
in the next life. This saying had come down to them from the most ancient people who were celestial, for while they were living on earth they were simultaneously present with angels in heaven and 
so knew all about this. That is to say, they knew that all who are governed by the same good meet and remain together in the next life, as do all who are governed by the same truth. They spoke of the 
former as being 'gathered to their fathers', but of the latter as being 'gathered to their peoples'; for with them 'fathers' meant goods, <a href="2803.htm">2803</a>, and 'peoples' truths, <a href="1259.htm">1259</a>, <a href="1260.htm">1260</a>. Furthermore because a 
like good was present in those who belonged to the Most Ancient Church they now live together in heaven, <a href="1115.htm">1115</a>; and so too do many of those live together who belonged to the Ancient Church and in whom 
a like truth dwelt, <a href="1125.htm">1125</a>, <a href="1127.htm">1127</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 What is more, while he lives in the body a person's soul is always present in some community of spirits in the next life, <a href="1277.htm">1277</a>, <a href="2379.htm">2379</a> - one who is evil in a community 
of hellish spirits, one who is good in a community of angels. Accordingly, everyone is present in a community consisting of the kind of people with whom he agrees so far as good and truth, or evil 
and falsity, are concerned. And into that same community a person comes when he dies, <a href="687.htm">687</a>. These are the things that were meant among the ancients by their being gathered to their fathers, or gathered 
to their peoples, as is said here of Abraham when he breathed his last, and of Ishmael in verse 17 of this same chapter, of Isaac in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2035:29&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 35:29</a>, of Jacob in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2049:29,%2033&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 49:29, 33</a>, of Aaron in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2020:24,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 20:24, 26</a>, of Moses in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2027:13;%2031:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 27:13; 31:2</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2032:50&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 32:50</a>, and of the first generation which entered the land of Canaan, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%202:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 2:10</a>. But in the internal sense of the Word when the subject has to do with anyone's 
life being representative, 'being gathered to his peoples', as stated above, in that case means that he ceases to be dealt with any longer. </p>

Quod `collectus ad populos suos' significet quod haec de Abrahamo, constat a significatione `colligi ad populos suos' quod sit non amplius de ipso; colligi enim ad populos suos, est abire ab illis inter 
quos prius fuit, et transire ad suos; ita hic non amplius repraesentare. Antiquis sollemne fuit dicere, cum aliquis moreretur, quod `colligeretur ad patres suos,' aut `ad populos suos,' et intellexerunt 
per id, quod actualiter venirent ad parentes suos, ad cognatos, et affines, in altera vita; ab antiquissimis, qui caelestes homines fuerunt, hoc habuerunt, illi enim cum vivebant in terra, etiam 
simul cum angelis fuerunt in caelo, ac ita noverunt quomodo se res haberet; nempe, quod omnes qui in eodem bono sunt, in altera vita conveniant (c)et simul sint, et quoque omnes qui in eodem vero sunt; 
de illis dicebant quod `congregarentur ad suos patres,' de his autem quod `colligerentur ad suos populos'; `patres' enim apud illos significabant bona, n. 2803 et `populi' significabant vera, n. 
1259, 1260; etiam illi qui fuerunt ab Antiquissima Ecclesia, quia in simili bono fuerunt, simul in caelo cohabitant, n. 1115; et quoque plures ex illis qui ab Antiqua Ecclesia, {1}et in simili vero, inter 
se, n. 1125, 1127: [2] et praeterea homo dum in corpore vivit, semper quoad animam suam in aliqua societate spirituum est in altera vita, n. 1277, 2379, homo qui malus est, in societate spirituum 
infernalium, qui bonus, in societate angelorum, ita quisque in societate talium cum quibus quoad bonum et verum, vel quoad malum et falsum, convenit; in eandem hanc societatem venit homo cum moritur, 
n. 687; haec sunt quae apud antiquos significabantur per quod {2}congregarentur ad patres, aut colligerentur ad populos suos; {3}sicut hic dicitur de Abrahamo cum exspiravit, et in eodem hoc capite de 
Jishmaele, vers. 17, de Jishako, Gen. xxxv 29; de Jacobo, Gen. xlix 29, 33; de Aharone, Num. xx 24, 26; de Mose, Num. xxvii 13; xxxi 2; Deut. xxxii 50; de generatione prima quae intrabat in terram Canaanem, 
Jud. ii 10. At in sensu interno Verbi, ubi agitur de vita alicujus, quod repraesentaverit, tunc per `colligi ad populos' significatur quod non amplius de illo, ut supra dictum. @1 inter se, 
qui in simili vero$  @2 colligerentur$  @3 sicut etiam legitur de Jischmaele in hoc cap. vers.17.$  </p>
