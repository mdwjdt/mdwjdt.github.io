<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8932节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8932.</strong>“你们不可作银神、金神与我同在”表他们要完全避开外在形式上看似真理和良善，内在形式上却是虚假和邪恶的那类事物。这从“作神”、“银”和“金”的含义清楚可知：“作神”是指敬拜，因为凡为自己造神明的人都是为了拜它们而造的；“银”是指真理，因而在反面意义上是指虚假；“金”是指良善，因而在反面意义上是指邪恶（参看<a href="113.htm">113</a>，<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="1552.htm">1552</a>，<a href="2954.htm">2954</a>，<a href="5658.htm">5658</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>，<a href="6917.htm">6917</a>，<a href="7999.htm">7999</a>节）。这些之所以是那些外在形式上看似真理和良善，内在形式上却是虚假和邪恶的事物，是因为经上说“你们不可作它们与我同在”，也就是与耶和华同在。神性真理本身和神性良善本身处于内在，同样处于外在；但内在的神性真理体现在代表形像或类型中；因为构成一种类型或形像的外在事物表示并代表内在事物。外在事物当与内在事物分离时，就是虚假和邪恶，它们被视为神圣或被敬拜；然而，它们仍看似真理和良善，因为它们代表真理和良善。“作银神、金神与耶和华神同在”就表示这些事。<br />这条诫命紧跟在十诫之后，因为以色列和犹太人民是这种人：他们视脱离内在事物的外在事物为神圣，并把它们完全当作神性来拜（<a href="3479.htm">3479</a>，<a href="3769.htm">3769</a>，<a href="4281.htm">4281</a>，<a href="4293.htm">4293</a>，<a href="4307.htm">4307</a>，<a href="4314.htm">4314</a>，<a href="4316.htm">4316</a>，<a href="4433.htm">4433</a>，<a href="4680.htm">4680</a>，<a href="4825.htm">4825</a>，<a href="4832.htm">4832</a>，<a href="4844.htm">4844</a>，<a href="4847.htm">4847</a>，<a href="4865.htm">4865</a>，<a href="4903.htm">4903</a>，<a href="6304.htm">6304</a>，<a href="6832.htm">6832</a>，<a href="8814.htm">8814</a>，<a href="8819.htm">8819</a>节）。为进一步了解那些外在形式上看似真理和良善，内在形式上却是虚假和邪恶的事物是什么，具有何种性质，我们以犹太教会的一切仪式为例；如祭祀、烧香、洗濯，以及其它许多仪式。就外在形式而言，它们都是真理和良善，但不是凭它们本身，而是因为它们是表示并代表内在真理和良善，也就是对主的爱和信的各个方面的类型或形像。当属于这类仪式的外在形式上的这类事物被视为神圣，尤其被敬拜时，如它们被成为偶像崇拜者，利用它们来拜外邦神的犹太人和以色列人敬拜时的情形，它们就不再与它们所表示并代表的真理和良善有任何关系，它们在内在形式上是虚假和邪恶。<br />在这人民当中作为天上和神性事物的类型或代表形像的其它一切事物也是这种情形。因为一旦代表内在事物的外在事物被用来拜别神，它们变成了他们所拜的偶像，或他们所作与耶和华神同在的“银神和金神”。事实上，那时这些事物在外在形式上看似真理和良善，但在内在形式上却是虚假和邪恶。<br />一般来说，“银神和金神”是指敬拜的一切虚假和衍生的邪恶，它们通过对圣言的错误利用和曲解，同时通过出于自我聪明的推理而被造得看似真理和良善。在以下经文中，“银神和金神”就表示这类事物。以赛亚书：<br />在以下经文中，“银神和金神”就表示这类事物。以赛亚书：<br />到那日，人必将他们为自己所造去跪拜的银偶像、金偶像抛给鼹鼠和蝙蝠；好进入磐石缝中和岩石隙里。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛2.20.htm">2:20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛2.21.htm">21</a>）<br />“鼹鼠和蝙蝠”表示那些在黑暗中，也就是沉浸于虚假和衍生的邪恶之人。<br />同一先知书：<br />到那日，各人必将他银偶像、金偶像，就是你们亲手为自己所造的，一个罪，都抛弃了。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛31.7.htm">31:7</a>）<br />“手所造的”表示那些出于自我聪明的事物。<br />匠人铸造雕像，金匠用金包裹它，为它铸造银链。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.19.htm">40:19</a>）<br />“雕像”是指那些出于人自己的东西（参看<a href="8869.htm">8869</a>节）；“用金包裹”表示使这些东西表面上看似良善；“铸造银链”表示使它们连贯起来，好像与真理连在一起。“金”表示良善，“银”表示真理，这一点可见于前面所引用的章节。<br />在耶利米书也是如此：<br />列族的习俗都是虚空。他从森林中砍下木头，是工匠的手工。他用银金妆饰它；他们用钉子和锤子钉稳它，使它不动摇。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶10.3.htm">10:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶10.4.htm">4</a>）<br />何西阿书：<br />现今以法莲人犯罪越来越多，用银子为自己作铸像，就是照自己的聪明造偶像，都是匠人的工作。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何13.2.htm">13:2</a>）<br />“以法莲”表示教会的理解力（<a href="5354.htm">5354</a>，<a href="6222.htm">6222</a>，<a href="6234.htm">6234</a>，<a href="6238.htm">6238</a>，<a href="6267.htm">6267</a>节）；“银铸像”表示看似真理的虚假，这就是为何经上说“照自己的聪明”；“都是匠人的工作”表示这一切都是通过出于自我或自己的推理产生的。<br />哈巴谷书：<br />对木头说，醒起！对哑巴石头说，这个必能教训人，那人有祸了！看哪！这是包裹金银的，它中间毫无气息。（哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈2.19.htm">2:19</a>）<br />“木头”表示邪恶；“石头”表示虚假；“包裹金银”表示通过应用所给予的良善和真理的表象。但以理书：<br />伯沙撒说，当他喝酒欢畅的时候，他们要把他的父尼布甲尼撒从在耶路撒冷的殿中所掠的金银器皿拿来，王与贵胄、皇后、妃嫔好用这器皿饮酒。他们饮酒，赞美金、银、铜、铁、木、石所造的神。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但5.2.htm">5:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但5.4.htm">4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但5.23.htm">23</a>）<br />“来自耶路撒冷殿的金、银的器皿”代表主的教会和国度的良善和真理；“用它们饮酒”表示通过邪恶和虚假，也就是“金、银所造的神”亵渎它们。<br />诗篇：<br />他们的偶像是银和金，是人手所造的。它们有口却不能言，有眼却不能看。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗115.4.htm">115:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗115.5.htm">5</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗135.15.htm">135:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗135.16.htm">16</a>）<br />“银和金，也就是偶像”表示虚假和邪恶；“人手所造的”表示它们是自我聪明的产物。摩西五经：<br />列族神明的雕像，你们要用火焚烧；其上的金银你不可贪图，也不可取为己有，这原是耶和华你神所憎恶的。可憎的物，你不可带进家去，免得你成了受诅咒的，与那物一样；你要十分憎嫌它。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.25.htm">7:25</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.26.htm">26</a>）<br />“雕像上的银金”表示被当作真理和良善来敬拜的虚假和邪恶，因为它们被造得看似真理和良善。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8932</b></p><p><b>8932.</b>
Ye shall not make with Me gods of silver and gods of gold. That this signifies that they should wholly abstain from such things as in the external form appear as true and good, but in the internal form 
are false and evil, is evident from the signification of "making gods," as being to worship, for he who makes unto himself gods does it for the sake of worship; from the signification of "silver," 
as being truth, consequently in the opposite sense, falsity; and from the signification of "gold," as being good, and consequently in the opposite sense, evil (see n. 113, 1551, 1552, 2954, 5658, 6914, 
6917, 7999). That those things are meant which appear true and good in the external form, but in the internal are false and evil, is because it is said, "Ye shall not make them with Me," that is, with 
Jehovah God; for Divine truth itself and Divine good itself are in internals and are likewise in externals; but in externals Divine truth and good are in representative types; for external things in 
a type have reference to and represent internal things. External things are false and evil whenever, being separate from internal things, they are accounted holy or are worshiped; and yet they still 
appear as true and good, because they represent what is true and good. These things are signified by "making with Jehovah God gods of silver and gods of gold." [2] This commandment follows immediately 
after the ten commandments, for the reason that the Israelitish and Jewish people was such that it accounted holy, and worshiped altogether as Divine, external things separated from internal (n. 3479, 
3769, 4281, 4293, 4307, 4314, 4316, 4433, 4680, 4825, 4832, 4844, 4847, 4865, 4903, 6304, 6832, 8814, 8819). That it may be further known what and of what quality are those things which in the external 
form appear as true and good, but in the internal are false and evil, let us take as an example all the rites of the Jewish Church; as the sacrifices, incenses, washings, and many others. In the 
external form these were true and good, not of themselves, but because in a type they had reference to or represented internal truths and goods, which are of love and faith in the Lord. When such things 
were accounted holy in the external form, and especially when they were worshiped, as by the Jews and Israelites when becoming idolaters they applied them to the worship of strange gods, they then 
retained nothing of the truths and goods which in a type they had reference to or represented, except the appearance, because in the internal form they were falsities and evils. [3] The case was similar 
with all the other things which with that people were types representative of heavenly and Divine things. For as soon as the external things which represented internal things were applied to the 
worship of other gods, they became idols which they worshiped, or gods of silver and of gold which they made with Jehovah God; for then in external form they appeared as true and good, but in the internal 
they were false and evil. [4] In general "gods of silver and of gold" denote all the falsities and derivative evils of worship, which are rendered like truth and good by wrong applications and interpretations 
of the Word, and at the same time by reasonings from self-intelligence. Such things are signified by "the gods of silver and of gold" in the following passages. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     In that 
day a man shall cast forth his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made for themselves to bow down to, to the moles and to the bats; to enter into the clefts of the rocks, and into the 
clefts of the crags (Isa. 2:20, 21). "Moles and bats" denote those who are in darkness, that is, in falsities and in the derivative evils. [5] Again in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     In that day they shall cast away 
every man his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your hands have made for you, a sin (Isa. 31:7). "Which the hands have made" denotes those things which are from self-intelligence. Again: </p>
<p> 
    The craftsman casteth a graven image, and the caster overlayeth it with gold, and casteth silver chains (Isa. 40:19). </p>
<p>"Graven images" denote those things which are from one's own (see n. 8869); 
"to overlay with gold" denotes to make them appear good in the external form; "casting silver chains," denotes to make them cohere together as if connected with truths. (That "gold" denotes good, 
and "silver" truth, may be seen in the passages cited above.) [6] In like manner in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     The statutes of the nations are vanity: surely he cutteth out wood from the forest, the work of the 
hands of the workman. He decketh it with gold and with silver; they fasten them with nails and with hammers, that it sway not to and fro (Jer. 10:3, 4). In Hosea: </p>
<p>     The Ephraimites sin more and 
more, and make them a molten image of silver, idols in their intelligence, all the work of the craftsmen (Hos. 13:2). "Ephraim" denotes the intellectual of the church (n. 5354, 6222, 6234, 6238, 6267); 
"a molten image of silver" denotes falsity appearing as truth, wherefore it is said "in their intelligence"; "all the work of the craftsmen" denotes that all was through reasonings from their own. [7] 
In Habakkuk: </p>
<p>     Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, This shall teach. Behold this is fixed with gold and silver, but there is no breath in the midst of it (Hab. 2:19). "Wood" 
denotes evil; "stone" falsity; "fixed with gold and silver" denotes the appearance of good and truth by means of applications. In Daniel: </p>
<p>     Belshazzar said while he well tasted the wine, 
that they should bring the vessels of gold and of silver which his father Nebuchadnezzar had brought out of the temple that was in Jerusalem; that the king and his great ones, his wives and his concubines, 
might drink therefrom. And they drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, of stone (Dan. 5:2-4, 23). "The vessels of gold and of silver, which were 
from the temple of Jerusalem," represented the goods and truths of the church and kingdom of the Lord; "to drink wine out of them" signified to profane by means of evils and falsities, which are "the 
gods of gold and of silver." [8] In David: </p>
<p>     Their idols are silver and gold, the work of a man's hands. They have a mouth, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not (Ps. 115:4, 5; 135:15-16). "The 
silver and gold which are idols" denote falsities and evils; "the work of a man's hands" denote that they are from self-intelligence. In Moses: </p>
<p>     The graven images of the gods of the 
nations shall ye burn with fire; thou shalt not covet the silver and the gold that is on them, to take it unto thee, for that is an abomination to Jehovah thy God; therefore thou shalt not bring an 
abomination into thy house, that there become what is accursed, like unto it, thou shalt utterly abhor it (Deut. 7:25-26). "The silver and gold upon graven images" denote the falsities and evils which 
are worshiped as truths and goods by reason of the appearance that is induced on them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8932</b></p><p><b>8932.</b>
'You shall not make [to be] with Me gods of silver and gods of gold' means that they are to avoid completely things which to outward appearances look like truths and forms of good but inwardly are falsities 
and evils. This is clear from the meaning of 'making gods' as worshipping, since someone who makes gods for himself does so in order to worship them; from the meaning of 'silver' as truth, and 
therefore in the contrary sense as falsity, and from the meaning of 'gold' as good, and therefore in the contrary sense as evil, both dealt with in <a href="113.htm">113</a>, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="1552.htm">1552</a>, <a href="2954.htm">2954</a>, <a href="5658.htm">5658</a>, <a href="6914.htm">6914</a>, <a href="6917.htm">6917</a>, <a href="7999.htm">7999</a>. The 
reason why these are things which to outward appearances look like truths and forms of good, but inwardly are falsities and evils, is that the words 'making them with Me', that is, with Jehovah God, are 
used Actual Divine Truth and Goodness reside on an inner level; they reside on an outer level as well, but then they are embodied in types or representative images. For the outward things composing 
a type or image stand for and represent inner realities. Outward things are falsities and evils when, separated from inner realities, they are held to be holy and are worshipped; and yet they still look 
like truths and forms of good because they represent those realities. These things are meant by 'making [to be] with Jehovah God gods of silver and gods of gold'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This commandment follows immediately 
after the Ten Commandments because the Israelite and Jewish people were the sort that held outward things separated from inward realities to be holy and worshipped them as being altogether 
Divine, <a href="3479.htm">3479</a>, <a href="3769.htm">3769</a>, <a href="4281.htm">4281</a>, <a href="4293.htm">4293</a>, <a href="4307.htm">4307</a>, <a href="4314.htm">4314</a>, <a href="4316.htm">4316</a>, <a href="4433.htm">4433</a>, <a href="4680.htm">4680</a>, <a href="4825.htm">4825</a>, <a href="4832.htm">4832</a>, <a href="4844.htm">4844</a>, <a href="4847.htm">4847</a>, <a href="4865.htm">4865</a>, <a href="4903.htm">4903</a>, <a href="6304.htm">6304</a>, <a href="6832.htm">6832</a>, <a href="8814.htm">8814</a>, <a href="8819.htm">8819</a>. To gain more definite knowledge of what those things are which look to outward 
appearances like truths and forms of good but inwardly are falsities and evils, and what those things are like, take as examples all the ritual practices of the Jewish Church, such as sacrifices, burning 
incense, washings, and many other practices. Outwardly they were truths and forms of good, not in themselves but because they were types or images that stood for and represented inward truths and 
forms of good, which are aspects of love to the Lord and faith in Him. When the outward objects belonging to such practices were held to be holy, and especially when they were worshipped, as they were 
by the Jews and Israelites when they became idolaters and used them in the worship of strange gods, they no longer had any connection with the truths and forms of good which they stood for and represented, 
because inwardly they were falsities and evils. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The situation was the same with all other things that were types or representative images of heavenly and Divine realities among that people. 
For as soon as outward things which represented inner realities were used in the worship of other gods they became idols worshipped by them or 'gods of silver and gold which they made [to be] with 
Jehovah God'. For then those things looked to outward appearances like truths and forms of good, but inwardly they were falsities and evils. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In general 'gods of silver and gold' are all the falsities 
and derivative evils in worship which are made to look like truth and good through wrong usages and misinterpretations of the Word, and at the same time through reasonings that are the product 
of self-intelligence. Such things are meant by 'gods of silver and gold' in the following places: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
On that day a person will cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold which they 
made for themselves to bow down to, to the moles and bats, to go into the clefts<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the rocks and into the fissures of the crags. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%202:20,%2021&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 2:20, 21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Moles and bats' stands for those who are in darkness, 
that is, are steeped in falsities and derivative evils. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
On that day a man will cast aside his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your hands have made for 
you - a sin. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2031:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 31:7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Which your hands have made' stands for things which are the product of self-intelligence. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The craftsman casts a graven image, and a goldsmith overlays 
it with gold and casts silver chains for it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2040:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 40:19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Graven images' are things which are products of the proprium or self, <a href="8869.htm">8869</a>. 'Overlaying with gold' stands for making things look to outward 
appearances like forms of good, 'casting silver chains' stands for making them seem to hang together as if linked to one another with truths, good being meant by 'gold' and truth by 'silver', see 
the paragraphs referred to above. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 Similarly in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The customs<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> of the nations are vanity. Since indeed one cuts out wood from the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, he 
decorates it with silver and gold; they make it firm with pegs and hammers, so that it is not unsteady. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2010:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 10:3, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
The Ephraimites sin more and more, and make for themselves a molten 
image from silver, idols by their own intelligence, completely the work of craftsmen. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%2013:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 13:2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Ephraim' stands for the Church's understanding, <a href="5354.htm">5354</a>, <a href="6222.htm">6222</a>, <a href="6234.htm">6234</a>, <a href="6238.htm">6238</a>, <a href="6267.htm">6267</a>; 'a molten image made 
from silver' stands for falsity that looks like truth, which is why it says 'by their own intelligence'; and 'completely the work of craftsmen' stands for the fact that it is all brought about through 
reasonings which are a product of the proprium or self. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 In Habakkuk, </p>
<blockquote>
Woe to him who says to a piece of wood, Awake! or to a dumb stone, Wake up, this will teach! Behold, this is bound in 
gold and silver, but there is no spirit in the midst of it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hab%202:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hab 2:19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'A piece of wood' stands for evil, 'a stone' for falsity. 'Bound in gold and silver' stands for applications used to give the 
appearance of what is good and true. In Daniel, </p>
<blockquote>
Belshazzar said, when he had properly tasted the wine, that they were to bring the vessels of gold and silver which his father Nebuchadnezzar had brought 
from the temple that [had been] in Jerusalem, in order that the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines might drink from them And they would drink wine, and praise the gods of gold and 
silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%205:2-4,%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 5:2-4, 23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The vessels of gold and silver from the temple of Jerusalem' represented the forms of good and the truths which belonged to the Church and to 
the Lord's kingdom; 'drinking wine from them' meant desecrating them by means of evils and falsities, which are 'the gods of gold and silver'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Their idols are silver and gold, the

<p>'Silver and gold, which are idols' stands for falsities and evils; 'the work 
of human hands' stands for the fact that they are the product of self-intelligence. In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
You shall burn the graven images of the gods of the nations with fire; you shall not covet the silver 
and the gold that are on them, so that you take them to yourself; for it is an abomination to Jehovah your God. Therefore you shall not bring an abomination into your house, lest you become<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> an accursed

<p>'Silver and gold on graven images' stands for falsities and evils which are worshipped as truths and forms of good because they have 
been made to look like these.

`Non facietis cum Me deos argenti et deos auri': quod significet ut abstineant prorsus a talibus quae in forma externa apparent ut vera et bona, sed in interna sunt falsa et mala, constat ex significatione 
`facere deos' quod sit colere, nam qui facit sibi deos, est propter cultum, ex significatione `argenti' quod sit verum, et inde in opposito sensu falsum, et ex significatione `auri' quod sit bonum, 
et inde {1} in opposito sensu malum, de quibus n. 113, 1551, 1552, 2954, 5658, 6914, 6917, 7999; quod sint quae apparent vera et bona in forma externa, at {2} in interna sunt falsa et mala, est 
quia dicitur `facere illos cum Me,' hoc est, cum Jehovah Deo, nam ipsum Divinum Verum et Bonum est in internis, et est quoque in externis, sed in his est Divinum Verum et Bonum in typis repraesentativis, 
nam externa typo referunt et {3} repraesentant interna; externa sunt falsa et mala cum ab internis separata pro sanctis habentur seu coluntur, et tamen (o)usque apparent sicut vera et bona, quia repraesentant 
illa {4}; haec significantur per `facere cum Jehovah Deo deos argenti et deos auri.' 	[2] Sequitur hoc praeceptum immediate post decem praecepta ex causa quia populus Israeliticus et Judaicus 
talis erat ut externa separata ab internis sancta haberet et (o)prorsus ut Divina coleret, n. 3479, 3769, 4281, 4293, 4307, 4314, 4316, 4433, 4680, 4825, 4832, 4844, 4847, 4865, 4903, 6304, 6832, 
8814, 8819.  Ut ulterius sciatur quaenam et qualia sunt illa quae in forma externa apparent ut vera et bona, sed [in] interna sunt falsa et mala, sint exemplo {5} omnes ritus Ecclesiae Judaicae, sicut 
sacrificia, suffitus, lavationes, et plures: (o)illi in forma externa erant {6} vera et bona, non ex se sed quia in typo referebant seu repraesentabant vera et bona interna, quae sunt amoris et fidei 
in Dominum; cum talia in externa forma pro sanctis habebantur, et magis cum colebantur, sicut a Judaeis (o)et Israelitis, cum facti idololatrae s applicuerunt {7} ad cultum deorum alienorum, tunc non 
aliud retinebant a veris et bonis quae typo referebant seu repraesentabant quam apparentiam, quia in forma interna erant falsa et mala. 	[3] Similiter se habebat cum reliquis, quae erant typi repraesentativi 
caelestium et Divinorum apud populum illum; externa `enim' quae repraesentabant interna, ut primum applicabantur ad cultum deorum aliorum, erant idola quae colebant, seu dii argenti et auri 
quos cum Jehovah Deo faciebant, nam tunc in forma externa apparebant ut vera et bona, sed in interna erant falsa et mala. 	[4] In genere `dii argenti et auri' sunt omnia falsa et inde mala cultus, 
quae redduntur similia vero et bono per sinistras applicationes (c)et interpretationes Verbi, et simul per ratiocinia ex propria intelligentia; talia significantur {8} per `deos argenti et auri' in sequentibus 
(o) his locis: apud Esaiam, 	In die illo projiciet homo idola argenti sui et idola auri sui quae fecerunt sibi ad incurvandum se, talpis et vespertilionibus, ad intrandum in fissuras petrarum 
et in fissuras rupium, ii 20, 21; </p>
<p>(o)`talpae et vespertiliones' pro illis qui in tenebris, hoc est, in falsis et inde malis:' [5] apud eundem, 	In die illo rejicient vir idola argenti sui et idola 
auri sui, quae fecerunt vobis manus vestrae, peccatum, xxxi 7; </p>
<p>`quae fecerunt manus' pro quae {9} ex propria intelligentia:  apud eundem, 	Sculptile fundit artifex, et conflator auro obducit, et catena 
argenti conflat, xl 19; </p>
<p>`sculptilia' pro illis quae ex proprio, n. 8869, `auro obducere' pro facere ut in (x)externa forma appareant bona, `catenas argenti conflare' pro facere ut cohaereant quasi 
nexa cum veris; quod `aurum' sit bonum et `argentum' verum, videantur loca supra citata:  [6] similiter apud Jeremiam, 	Statuta gentium vanitas illa; siquidem lignum de silva excidit, opus manuum 
fabri, argento et auro {10} exornat illud; clavis et malleis firmant illa, ut non vacillet, x 3, 4: </p>
<p>apud Hoscheam, 	(x)Ephraimii addunt peccare, et faciunt sibi fusile ex argento in intelligentia sua 
idola, opus artificum totum, xiii 2; </p>
<p>`Ephraim' pro intellectuali Ecclesiae, n. 5354, 6222, 6234, 6238, 6267 `fusile ex argento' pro falso apparente ut vero, quare dicitur `in intelligentia sua,' `opus 
artificum totum' pro (x)quod omne (o)per ratiocinia ex proprio: [7] apud Habakuk, 	Vae dicenti ligno, Expergiscere; Evigila, lapidi silenti, hic docebit! hic ecce fixus auro et argento, sed spiritus 
non in medio ejus, ii 19; </p>
<p>`lignum' pro malo, `lapis' pro falso; `fixus auro et argento' pro apparentia boni et veri per applicationes: apud Danielem, 	Belschazar dixit, cum probe gustabat vinum, 
ut adducerent vasa auri et argenti quae adduxerat Nebuchadnezar pater illius e templo quod in Hierosolyma, ut biberent ex iis rex et magnates ejus, uxores ejus et paelices ejus; et biberent vinum, et 
laudarent deos auri et argenti, aeris, ferri, ligni, lapidis, v 2-4, 23; </p>
<p>`vasa auri et argenti quae ex templo Hierosolymae {11}' repraesentabant bona et vera Ecclesiae ac regni Domini, `bibere vinum' 
ex illis significabat {12} profanare per mala et falsa, quae sunt `dii auri (x)et argenti': [8] apud Davidem, 	Idola eorum argentum et aurum, opus manuum hominis; os illis sed non loquuntur, oculi 
illis sed non vident, Is. cxv 4, 5; Ps. cxxxv 15, 16; </p>
<p>argentum et aurum, quae idola' pro falsis et malis, `opus manuum hominis' pro quod ex propria intelligentia {13}: apud Moschen, 	Sculptilia deorum 
gentium comburetis igne; non concupisces argentum et aurum super illis ut accipias tibi; abominatio namque Jehovae Dei tui illud; ideo non inferes abominationem in domum tuam, ut fiat devotio, sicut 
illud; abominando abominaberis illud, Deut. vii 25, 26; </p>
<p>argentum et aurum super sculptilibus' pro falsis et malis quae coluntur ut vera et bona ex apparentia illis inducta. @1 d et i inde$ @2 sed$ @3
