<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9472节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9472.</strong>“皂荚木”表从主发出，因而唯独属于主的功德之善。这从“木”的含义清楚可知，“木”是指功德之善（参看<a href="1110.htm">1110</a>，<a href="2784.htm">2784</a>，<a href="2812.htm">2812</a>，<a href="4943.htm">4943</a>，<a href="8740.htm">8740</a>节）。功德之善是指从主的神性人身发出的良善，也就是基督良善，或与人同在的属灵良善。人正是凭这种良善而得救；事实上，从任何其它源头发出的良善都不是良善，因为它没有神，因而也没有天堂，进而没有救恩的任何东西在里面。皂荚木是最优质的香柏木；而“香柏树”表示属灵教会。皂荚木是一种香柏树，这一点明显可见于以赛亚书：<br />我要在旷野栽植皂荚香柏树、桃金娘树和油木。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛41.19.htm">41:19</a>）<br />此处“皂荚香柏树”表示属灵良善，“油木”表示属天良善。由于唯独属于主的功德之善是唯一在天堂掌权并构成天堂的良善，所以这种木头是用来建造代表天堂的帐幕的唯一木头。例如，它被用来制造盛有法版的柜子本身；抬柜的杠子；摆有陈设饼的的桌子，抬桌子的杠子；居所的竖板；遮盖的闩和柱子；以及祭坛和坛杠；这从本章（25:10，13，23，28）和下一章（26:15，26，37），以及27章（27:1，6）清楚看出来。</p>

And shittim wood. That this signifies the goods of merit which are from the Lord and thus of the Lord alone, is evident from the signification of "wood," as being the good of merit (see n. 1110, 2784, 
2812, 4943, 8740). The good of merit is the good that proceeds from the Divine Human of the Lord, which is Christian good, or spiritual good with man. It is this good by which man is saved; for good 
which proceeds from any other source is not good, because the Divine is not in it, thus neither is heaven in it, consequently salvation is not in it. Shittim wood was the wood of the most excellent cedar; 
and by the "cedar" is signified the spiritual of the church. That shittim wood was a species of cedar, is evident in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     I will set in the wilderness the cedar of Shittah, and the myrtle, 
and the wood of oil (Isa. 41:19); </p>
<p>where "the cedar of Shittah" denotes spiritual good, and "the wood of oil" celestial good. As the good of merit that belongs to the Lord alone is the only good that 
reigns in heaven, and that makes heaven, therefore this wood was the only wood employed in the construction of the tabernacle (by which heaven was represented); as for instance for the ark itself, 
in which was the testimony; for its staves; for the table upon which were the breads of faces, and its staves; for the planks of the Habitation; for the bars and pillars of the covering; and also for 
the altar and its staves; as is evident from verses 10, 13, 23, 28 of this chapter; from verses 15, 26, 37 of the following chapter; and verses 1 and 6 of chapter 27. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9472</b></p><p><b>9472.</b>
'And pieces of shittim wood' means good deeds worthy of merit that proceed from the Lord, and so are the Lord's alone. This is clear from the meaning of 'pieces of wood' as the good of merit, dealt with 
in <a href="1110.htm">1110</a>, <a href="2784.htm">2784</a>, <a href="2812.htm">2812</a>, <a href="4943.htm">4943</a>, <a href="8740.htm">8740</a>. The good of merit is good proceeding from the Lord's Divine Human, which is Christian good, or spiritual good present with a person. This good is the one by means 
of which a person is saved; for good which proceeds from any other source is not good since it has nothing of God in it, nor thus of heaven, nor therefore any health or salvation in it. Shittim wood was 
the wood of the most excellent kind of cedar, and 'the cedar' means the spiritual Church. The fact that shittim wood was a species of cedar is clear in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will plant<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> in the wilderness the 
cedar of shittah, and the myrtle, and the oil tree.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2041:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 41:19</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the cedar of shittah' stands for spiritual good, 'the oil tree' for celestial good. Since the good worthy of merit, which 
is the Lord's alone, is the one and only good that reigns in heaven and makes heaven, that wood was the one and only wood that was used in the construction of the tabernacle, by which heaven was represented. 
It was used for example to make the actual ark, which had the Testimony in it; its poles; the table on which the loaves of the Presence were laid, and its poles; the boards for the dwelling-place; 
the poles and the pillars of the covering; and also the altar and its poles, as is clear from verses 10, 13, 23, 28, of the present chapter, and from <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2026:15,%2026,%2037;%2027:1,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 26:15, 26, 37; 27:1, 6</a>.

`Et ligna schittim': quod significent bona meriti quae a Domino, ita solius Domini, constat ex significatione `lignorum' quod sint bonum meriti, de qua n. 1110, 2784, 2812, 4943, 8740; bonum meriti 
est bonum procedens a Divino Humano Domini, quod est bonum Christianum, seu bonum spirituale apud hominem; hoc bonum est per quod homo salvatur; nam bonum quod aliunde procedit non est bonum, {1}nam non 
est Divinum in eo, ita {2}nec caelum in eo, proinde non est salus in eo. Lignum schittim erat lignum cedri praestantissimae et per `cedrum' significatur spirituale Ecclesiae; quod lignum schittim fuerit 
species cedri, constat apud Esaiam, 	Dabo in deserto cedrum schittae, et (x)myrtum, et lignum olei xli 19; </p>
<p>ubi `cedrus schittae' pro bono spirituali, `lignum olei' pro bono caelesti.  Quia bonum 
meriti, quod solius Domini, est unicum bonum quod regnat in caelo et quod facit caelum, ideo id lignum erat unicum lignum quod adhibebatur ad constructionem {3}tabernaculi', per quod repraesentabatur 
caelum; prout ad ipsam arcam, in qua testimonium, ad vectes ejus, ad mensam super qua panes facierum, et ad hujus vectes, ad asseres pro habitaculo, ad vectes et ad columnas tegumenti, tum ad altare 
et ejus vectes; ut constat ex hujus capitis vers. 10, 13, 23, 28, et ex seqq. xxvi 15, 26, 37, xxvii i, 6. @1 non enim$ @2 non est$ @3 tentorii$ </p>
