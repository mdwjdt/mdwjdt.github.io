<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第936节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>936．“昼与夜”表这个重生之人，或凡重生之人在属其觉知之物方面的状态，该状态的交替如同昼与夜。这一点从刚才所述清楚可知。“夏与冬”论及意愿之物，因为它们象意愿之物那样具有热和冷的表现，而“昼与夜”论及觉知之物，因为它们象觉知之物那样具有明和暗的表现。由于这些事物不证自明，故没有必要通过圣言的类似经文加以证实。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]936.</strong> The symbolism of day and night as the condition of this same regenerate person in respect to concepts in the intellect, which alternate the way day and night do, is established by statements just above.<br />Summer and winter have to do with the contents of the will because of the warmth and cold involved, since matters of the will grow warm or cold. But day and night have to do with the contents of the intellect because of the light and dark involved, since matters of the intellect exist in light or darkness.<br />Because the statements made here are self-evident, they need no confirmation from similar passages in the Word. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 936</b></p><p><b>936.</b>
That "day and night" signify the state of the same, that is, of the regenerate man, as to the things of the understanding, the alternations of which are as day and night, is evident from what has just 
been said. "Summer and winter" are predicated of what is of the will, from their cold and heat; for so it is with the things of the will. But "day and night" are predicated of what is of the understanding, 
from their light and darkness; for so it is with the things of the understanding. As these things are self-evident, there is no need to confirm them by other like passages from the Word. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 936</b></p><p><b>936.</b>
'Day and night' means the state of the same person, that is, of one who is regenerate, as regards things belonging to his understanding, which alternate as day and night do. This is clear from what has 
just been stated. Summer and winter have reference to things of the will because like things of the will, they are manifestations of heat and of cold, whereas day and night have reference to things 
of the understanding because, like things of the understanding, they are manifestations of light and darkness. Since these matters are self-evident there is no need to confirm them from similar examples 
in the Word. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 936</b>
</p><b>936.</b>
Quod 'dies et nox' significent statum ejusdem seu regenerati quoad intellectualia quorum vices se habent sicut dies et nox, ex illis quae nunc dicta sunt, constat: 'aestas et hiems' praedicatur de voluntariis, 
ex calore et frigore, nam voluntaria se ita habent; 'dies' autem et 'nox' de intellectualibus, ex luce et tenebris, nam intellectualia se ita habent: haec quia ex se manifesta sunt, non opus 
est similibus ex Verbo confirmare. </p>
