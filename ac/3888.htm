<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3888节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3888.</strong>这两个国度通过人里面的那两个国度显现在人里面。人里面的那两个国度就是意愿的国度和认知的国度，这两个国度构成人的心智，事实上构成这个人自己。意愿与心跳相对应，而认知则与肺呼吸相对应。因此，人体同样有两个国度，即心脏国度和肺脏国度。人若知道这个奥秘，也就能知道意愿如何流入认知，认知如何流入意愿，因而知道人如何重生。但仅仅局限于肉体观念，也就是以邪恶为其意愿的目标，以虚假为其认知的目标之人无法理解这些事。因为他们若离了感官和肉体，就无法思想属灵和属天之物。因此，他们只能通过天堂之光（即信之真理）的事物的黑暗和天堂之火（即爱之良善）的事物的冷漠来思想这些事。这二者，即黑暗和冷漠彻底抹去属天和属灵之物，以至于在这些人看来，它们似乎什么也不是。</p>

These two kingdoms are presented to view in man by means of the two kingdoms that are in him, namely, the kingdom of the will, and the kingdom of the understanding, which two kingdoms constitute the 
mind of man, nay, the man himself. The will is that to which corresponds the pulsation of the heart; and the understanding is that to which corresponds the respiration of the lungs. For this reason there 
are likewise in the body of man two kingdoms, namely, those of the heart and the lungs. He who knows this mystery may also know how the case is with the influx of the will into the understanding, 
and of the understanding into the will; consequently with the influx of the good of love into the truth of faith, and vice versa; thus how the case is with the regeneration of man. But they who are only 
in corporeal ideas, that is, who are in the will of what is evil and the understanding of what is false, cannot apprehend these things; for they cannot think of spiritual and celestial things otherwise 
than sensuously and corporeally, consequently not otherwise than from darkness of the things of heavenly light (or of the truth of faith), and from cold of the things of heavenly flame (or of the 
good of love). This darkness and cold so extinguish celestial and spiritual things that these appear to such persons to have no existence. </p>

Those two kingdoms manifest themselves in man through the two kingdoms which exist within him - the kingdom of the will and the kingdom of the understanding which constitute man's mind, indeed man himself. 
It is the will to which the beating of the heart corresponds, and the understanding to which the breathing of the lungs corresponds. Those two kingdoms also manifest themselves in man's body, where 
again there are two kingdoms - that of the heart and that of the lungs. Anyone who knows this arcanum is also able to know about the influx of the will into the understanding and of the understanding 
into the will and consequently to know about the influx of the good of love into the truth of faith, and vice versa, and so about the regeneration of man. But people who are restricted solely to 
bodily ideas, that is, people who have evil as the object of their will and falsity the object of their understanding cannot grasp these matters, for they cannot think about spiritual and celestial things 
except with the senses and the body. Consequently they cannot think of those things except from a thick darkness concerning the things that constitute heavenly light, which is the truth of faith, 
and from a coldness concerning the things that constitute heavenly flame, which is the good of love. Those two - the thick darkness and the coldness - so blot out celestial and spiritual things that 
they do not seem to those people to be anything. </p>

</p><b>3888.</b>
Bina illa regna sistuntur in homine per bina illa regna quae apud illum, nempe per regnum voluntatis et per regnum intellectus, quae bina constituunt hominis mentem, immo ipsum hominem; voluntas 
est cui correspondet pulsus cordis, et intellectus est cui correspondet respiratio pulmonis; inde quoque est quod in corpore hominis etiam sint bina regna, nempe cordis et pulmonum; qui hoc arcanum 
novit, etiam nosse potest quomodo se habet cum influxu voluntatis in intellectum, ac intellectus in voluntatem, consequenter cum influxu boni amoris in verum fidei, et reciproce, ita quomodo se habet 
cum regeneratione hominis; sed qui in ideis corporeis solum sunt, hoc est, qui in voluntate mali et intellectu falsi, haec non capere possunt, ii enim de spiritualibus et caelestibus non aliter 
cogitare possunt quam sensualiter et corporee, proinde non nisi quam ex caligine de illis quae sunt lucis caelestis seu veri fidei, et ex frigore de illis quae sunt flammae caelestis seu boni amoris, 
utrumque, nempe caligo illa et frigus illud, exstinguit adeo caelestia et spiritualia ut appareant eis sicut nulla. </p>
