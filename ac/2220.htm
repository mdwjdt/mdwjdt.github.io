<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2220节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>2220．“所多玛”是指一切源于自我之爱的罪恶。这从圣言中“所多玛”的含义清楚可知。虽然从下一章来看，所多玛似乎表示最严重的奸淫罪恶，但它在内义上无非表示源于自我之爱的一切邪恶。在圣言中，从自我之爱涌出的可怕事物也表现为各种奸淫。“所多玛”一般表示源于自我之爱的一切邪恶，而“蛾摩拉”则表示由此而来的一切虚假。这一点在第一卷有所说明（<a href="1212.htm">1212</a>，<a href="1663.htm">1663</a>，<a href="1682.htm">1682</a>，<a href="1689.htm">1689</a>节），并且从以下圣言经文看得更清楚。耶利米书：<br />耶和华说，要像我倾覆所多玛、蛾摩拉和邻近的城邑一样，有刀剑临到迦勒底人和巴比伦的居民。必无人住在那里，也无人在其中寄居。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.35.htm">50:35</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.40.htm">40</a>）<br />这论及迦勒底所表示的那些人，其敬拜就在于亵渎的虚假（参看<a href="1368.htm">1368</a>节）；也论及巴比伦所表示的那些人，其敬拜在于亵渎的邪恶（参看<a href="1182.htm">1182</a>，<a href="1326.htm">1326</a>节）。他们的刑罚被描述为“所多玛”的倾覆，即总体邪恶的倾覆，和“蛾摩拉”的倾覆，即总体虚假的倾覆。因为他们的敬拜也在于源于自我之爱的罪恶，和由此而来的虚假。<br />阿摩司书：<br />我倾覆你们，如同我从前倾覆所多玛、蛾摩拉一样，使你们好像从火中抽出来的一根柴。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩4.11.htm">4:11</a>）<br />这论及撒玛利亚，它表败坏的属灵教会，就违背仁之善的总体邪恶而言，它被称为“所多玛”，就违背信之真的总体虚假而言，它被称为“蛾摩拉”，就这二者而言（此处和前面一样），它被称为“神的倾覆”。西番雅书：<br />摩押必像所多玛，亚扪人必像蛾摩拉，都变为刺草、盐坑、永远荒废之地。这事临到他们是因他们骄傲，自夸自大，毁谤万军之耶和华的百姓。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番2.9.htm">2:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/番2.10.htm">10</a>）<br />此处“所多玛”表源于自我之爱的邪恶，“蛾摩拉”表由此而来的虚假，这二者在此被描述为“荒废”，和前面一样被“倾覆”。“骄傲”是指自我之爱，“毁谤万军之耶和华的百姓”是指以邪恶对抗真理，“自夸自大”是指以虚假对抗它们。<br />以西结书：<br />你的姐姐是撒玛利亚，她和她的女儿们住在你左边；你的妹妹是所多玛，她和她的女儿们住在你右边。你妹妹所多玛、她和她的女儿们，尚且没有行过你和你的女儿们所行过的事呢。看哪，你妹妹所多玛的罪孽是这样：她和她的众女都心骄气傲，粮食饱足，大享安逸，并没有扶助困苦和穷乏人的手。她们狂傲，在我面前行可憎的事。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.46.htm">16:46</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.50.htm">50</a>）<br />这论及耶路撒冷的可憎之事，它被描述为“撒玛利亚”和“所多玛”；“撒玛利亚”取代蛾摩拉，用来描述涉及虚假的可憎之事，“所多玛”则用来描述涉及邪恶的可憎之事。此处还提到“所多玛”特指什么，因为经上说，“所多玛的罪孽是这样”，即它是指自我之爱，就是此处“心骄气傲”所表示的。他们转离仁之善，以“粮食饱足”来表示；他们满足于这些事物（即虚假与邪恶），以“大享安逸”来表示；他们缺乏同情心被描述为他们“没有扶助困苦和穷乏人的手”；由此产生的一切欲望充满自我之爱，以他们的女儿们“狂傲”来表示；“女儿”表示这类欲望。<br />由此明显可知“所多玛”是什么意思，即它的意义和下一章的历史意义不一样。在下一章，所多玛在内义上是指诸如此处以西结书所描述的这类事物，即属于自我之爱的事物。但此处对所多玛的描述相对温和，因为所论述的耶路撒冷的可憎之事比所多玛的更大，这从主在马太福音中所说的话明显可知：<br />我实在告诉你们：当审判的日子，所多玛和蛾摩拉之地所受的，比那城还容易受呢！（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.15.htm">10:15</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可6.11.htm">6:11</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.12.htm">10:12</a>）<br />启示录：<br />他们的尸首就倒在那大城的街道上，这城按着灵意叫所多玛，又叫埃及。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启11.8.htm">11:8</a>）<br />此处很明显，“所多玛”并非指所多玛，“埃及”也并非指埃及，因为经上说，“这城按着灵意叫所多玛，又叫埃及”；“所多玛”表源于自我之爱的一切邪恶，“埃及”取代蛾摩拉表源于此的一切虚假。</p>

That "Sodom" is all evil from the love of self, is evident from the signification of "Sodom" in the Word. Although in the following chapter it appears as if the evil of the worst adultery was signified 
by "Sodom," nevertheless in the internal sense nothing else than evil from the love of self is signified by it. In the Word also the abominations that well forth from the love of self are represented 
by adulteries of various kinds. That "Sodom" signifies in general all evil from the love of self, and "Gomorrah" all falsity therefrom, has been shown in volume 1 (n. 1212, 1663, 1682, 1689), and is 
further evident from the following passages in the Word. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     A sword upon the Chaldeans, and upon the inhabitants of Babel, as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and the neighbor 
cities thereof, saith Jehovah, there shall not a man dwell there, and there shall not a son of man sojourn therein (Jer. 50:35, 40). This passage treats of those signified by the Chaldeans, who are such 
as have profane falsity in their worship (see n. 1368); and of those signified by Babel, who are such as have profane evil in their worship (see n. 1182, 1326). Their condemnation is described by 
the "overthrow of Sodom," that is, of evil in general, and by the "overthrow of Gomorrah," that is, of falsity in general; because they also have in their worship the evil of the love of self, and the 
derivative falsity. [2] In Amos: </p>
<p>     I have overthrown you as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah; and ye became as a brand plucked out of the burning (Amos 4:11), where Samaria is treated of, 
by which is signified the perverted spiritual church, and which in respect to evils in general contrary to the goods of charity is called "Sodom," and in respect to falsities in general contrary to the 
truths of faith is called "Gomorrah;" and in respect to both (here as previously) is called the "overthrowing of God." In Zephaniah: </p>
<p>     Moab shall be as Sodom, and the sons of Ammon as Gomorrah, 
a forsaken place of the nettle, and a pit of salt, and a desolation even to eternity; this shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and have enlarged upon the people of Jehovah Zebaoth 
(Zeph. 2:9-10), where "Sodom" denotes evil from the love of self, and "Gomorrah" the derivative falsity, of both of which "desolation" is here predicated, as previously was "overthrow." "Pride" 
is the love of self; to "reproach the people of Jehovah Zebaoth," is to bring evil upon truths; and to "enlarge upon the people," is to bring falsity upon them. [3] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Thine elder sister 
is Samaria, that dwelleth at thy left hand, she and her daughters; and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters. Thy sister Sodom hath not done, she and her 
daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters. Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom; pride, satiety of bread, and security of ease, were in her and her daughters, and she did not strengthen 
the hand of the wretched and needy; and they became haughty, and committed abomination before Me (Ezek. 16:46-50), where the abominations of Jerusalem are treated of, and are described by "Samaria" 
and "Sodom"; by "Samaria," instead of Gomorrah, as to falsities, and by "Sodom" as to evils; and it is stated what is specifically signified by "Sodom," for it is said, "this was the iniquity 
of Sodom," to wit that it was the love of self, which is there signified by "pride." That they turned away from the goods of charity, is signified by the "satiety of bread;" that they had acquiesced 
in these things, is signified by the "security of ease;" that they had no mercy, is described by their "not having strengthened the hand of the poor and needy;" and that all the cupidities thence derived 
are imbued with the love of self, is signified by their "daughters having become haughty;" the "daughters" are cupidities.  [4] Hence it is manifestly evident what "Sodom" is, thus that it is not 
according to the historic sense in the following chapter, but that such things are there signified in the internal sense as are described here by the prophet, namely, those which are of the love of self. 
But Sodom is here described more mildly because the abominations of Jerusalem are treated of as having been greater than those of Sodom, as is also evident from the Lord's words in Matthew: </p>
<p>    
 Verily I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city (Matt. 10:15; Mark 6:11; Luke 10:12). In John: </p>
<p>     Their bodies shall 
lie upon the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt (Rev. 11:8), where it is evident that by "Sodom" is not meant Sodom, nor Egypt by "Egypt," for it is said that it is 
"spiritually called Sodom and Egypt;" "Sodom" denotes all evil from the love of self, and "Egypt" (instead of Gomorrah) all derivative falsity. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2220</b></p><p><b>2220.</b>
That 'Sodom' is every evil that stems from self-love is clear from the meaning of 'Sodom' in the Word. Although in the next chapter it seems as if Sodom means the evil that consists in the worst form 
of adultery, nevertheless nothing else is meant by it in the internal sense than evil that stems from self-love. In the Word also the dreadful things that well up out of self-love are represented by 
various kinds of adultery. That 'Sodom' means in general every evil that stems from self-love, and 'Gomorrah' every falsity derived from this, has been shown in Volume One, in <a href="1212.htm">1212</a>, <a href="1663.htm">1663</a>, <a href="1682.htm">1682</a>, <a href="1689.htm">1689</a>, 
and may become clearer still from the following places in the Word: In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
A sword over the Chaldeans and over the inhabitants of Babel as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and its neighbours, 
said Jehovah. No man will live there, and no son of man will abide in it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2050:%2035,%2040&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 50: 35, 40</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to those meant by 'the Chaldeans' whose worship consists in profane falsity, as shown already 
in <a href="1368.htm">1368</a>, and also to those meant by 'Babel' whose worship consists in profane evil, <a href="1182.htm">1182</a>, <a href="1326.htm">1326</a>. Their condemnation is described by the overthrow of Sodom, that is, of evil in general, and by the 
overthrow of Gomorrah, that is, of falsity in general, since their worship too consists in evil that stems from self-love, and in falsity derived from this. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In Amos, </p>
<blockquote>
I overthrew you, as when 
God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you became as a brand plucked out of the burning. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%204:-11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 4:-11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Samaria, by which is meant the perverted spiritual Church, which as regards evils 
in general contrary to the goods of charity is called 'Sodom', as regards falsities in general contrary to truths of faith is called 'Gomorrah', and as regards both is described here, as in the previous 
quotation, as 'the overthrowing of God'. In Zephaniah, </p>
<blockquote>
Moab will be like Sodom, and the children of Ammon like Gomorrah, a place abandoned to the nettle, and a saltpit, and a desolation even 
for ever. This will be theirs for their arrogance because they taunted and magnified themselves against the people of Jehovah Zebaoth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zeph%202:%209,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zeph 2: 9, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'Sodom' stands for evil stemming from self-love, 
and 'Gomorrah' for falsity derived from this, both of which are referred to here as 'a desolation', as they were 'an overthrowing' in the two previous quotations. 'Arrogance' is self-love, 'taunting 
the people of Jehovah Zebaoth' is bringing evil against truths, and 'magnifying themselves against the people' is bringing falsity against them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Your elder sister is Samaria, 
she and her daughters, dwelling on your left hand; and your younger sister, dwelling on your right hand, is Sodom and her daughters Your sister Sodom has not done, she and her daughters, as you have 
done, you and your daughters. Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom; she and her daughters had pride, surfeit of bread, and prosperous ease, but she did not strengthen the hand of the 
wretched and needy. And they became haughty and did abominable things before Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2016:%2046,%2048-50&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 16: 46, 48-50</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the abominations of Jerusalem, which are described as Samaria and Sodom 'Samaria', 
used instead of Gomorrah, describing the abominations involving falsities, and 'Sodom' those involving evils. What is meant specifically by 'Sodom' is also stated, for it is said, 'this was the iniquity 
of Sodom', namely that it was self-love, meant here by 'pride'. Their rejection of the goods of charity is meant by 'surfeit of bread', and their satisfaction taken in those [falsities and evils] 
by 'prosperous ease'. Their lack of compassion is described by the statement that they did not strengthen the hand of the poor and needy, and the impregnation with self-love of their desires resulting 
from this is described by the statement that the daughters became haughty - such desires being meant by 'daughters'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 From this it is quite clear what Sodom means - that its meaning is not the 
same as what occurs in the historical sense in the next chapter, and that by Sodom in the next chapter such things are meant in the internal sense as are described here in Ezekiel, namely things belonging 
to self-love. But the description of Sodom here is milder because reference is made to the abominations of Jerusalem having been greater than those of Sodom, as is evident also from the Lord's 
words in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Truly I say to you, It will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgement than for that city. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2010:%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 10: 15</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%206:%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 6: 11</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2010:-12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 10:-12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In John, </p>
<blockquote>
Their 
bodies will lie in the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2011:%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 11: 8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here it is clear that 'Sodom' is not used to mean Sodom nor 'Egypt' to mean Egypt, for 
it is said that 'spiritually it is called Sodom and Egypt'. 'Sodom' stands for every evil stemming from self-love, and 'Egypt', used instead of Gomorrah, for every falsity derived from this. </p>

Quod `Sodoma' sit omne malum ex amore sui, constat ex significatione `Sodomae' in Verbo; tametsi in capite sequente appareat sicut per `Sodomam' significetur malum pessimi adulterii, usque tamen per 
eam in sensu interno, nihil aliud quam malum ex amore sui significatur; in Verbo etiam abominationes ex amore sui scaturientes, per adulteria diversi generis repraesentantur.  Quod `Sodoma' significet 
in genere omne malum ex amore sui, et `Amora' omne falsum inde, in Parte Prima n. 1212, 1663, 1682, 1689 ostensum est; et porro constare potest ex his locis in Verbo: apud Jeremiam, 	Gladius super 
Chaldaeos,... et super habitatores Babelis,... juxta eversionem Dei, Sodomam et Amoram, et vicinas ejus, dictum Jehovae, Non habitabit ibi vir, et non commorabitur in ea filius hominis, l 35, 40; </p>
<p>agitur 
ibi de illis qui significantur per `Chaldaeos,' qui sunt in quorum cultu falsum profanum, [est,] ut prius n. 1368 ostensum; tum de (c)illis qui per `Babelem,' qui sunt in quorum cultu est malum profanum, 
n. 1182, 1326; illorum damnatio describitur per eversionem Sodomae, hoc est, mali in genere, et per eversionem Amorae, hoc est, falsi in genere, quia etiam in illorum cultu est malum amoris sui 
et falsum inde: [2] apud Amos, 	Subverti vos juxta eversionem Dei, Sodomam et Amoram, et facti sicut torris erutus ex incendio, iv 11; </p>
<p>ubi de Samaria, per quam significatur perversa Ecclesia spiritualis 
quae quoad mala in genere contra bona charitatis vocatur `Sodoma' et quoad falsa in genere contra vera fidei vocatur `Amora'; et quoad utrumque, hic ut prius, `eversio Dei': apud Zephaniam, 	Moab 
sicut Sodoma erit, et filii Ammonis sicut Amora, locus derelictus urticae, et fovea salis, et desolatio usque in aeternum:... hoc illis propter superbiam eorum, quod opprobrio affecerunt, et dilatarunt 
super populum Jehovae Zebaoth, ii 9, 10; </p>
<p>ubi `Sodoma' pro malo ex amore sui, et `Amora' pro falso inde, de quibus hic praedicatur `desolatio,' sicut prius eversio; `superbia' est amor sui; `opprobrio 
afficere populum Jehovae Zebaoth' est malum inferre veris, et `dilatare super populum' est falsum: [3] apud Ezechielem, 	Soror tua major Samaria, ipsa et filiae ejus, habitans administram tuam; 
et soror tua minor prae te, habitans a dextra tua, Sodoma et filiae ejus:... non fecit Sodoma soror tua, ipsa et filiae ejus, quemadmodum fecisti tu et filiae tuae: ecce haec fuit iniquitas Sodomae 
sororis tuae, superbia, saturitas panis, et securitas otii, fuit illi et filiabus ejus, et manum miseri et egeni non confirmavit; et elatae factae sunt, et fecerunt abominationem coram Me {1}, xvi 46, 
48-50; </p>
