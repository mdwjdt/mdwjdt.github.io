<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3908节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3908.</strong>“不然我就死了”表否则，（对内在真理的情感）就不会复活得生命。这从“死”的含义清楚可知，“死”是指不复活得生命。古时，妻子若生不出一儿半女，就自称死了；她们还相信自己死了，因为关于她们的记忆，可以说生命没有留给后代。她们如此自称和相信其实是由于世俗的原因。但每个原因都是先于它自己的另一个原因的显现，因而自然界所存在原因的方方面面就是灵界所存在原因的产物，所提到这个原因也是如此。灵界所存在的原因来源于良善与真理的天堂婚姻，该婚姻除了信之真理和仁之良善的生产外，没有别的生产。这些真理与良善就是在灵界所生的众子和众女，在圣言中也以众子和众女来表示。凡没有这些生产，也就是没有生出信之真理和仁之良善的人，可以说都是死的，因为他就属于没有复活，也就是没有得生命或进入天堂的死人之列。由此可见，拉结所说的“不然我就死了”这句话是什么意思。</p>

And if not, I am dead. That this signifies that thus there would be no rising again, is evident from the signification of "dying," as being not to rise again into life. In ancient times wives called 
themselves "dead" when they did not bring forth a son or a daughter; and they also believed themselves to be so, because no memory of them, or as it were no life, would be left to posterity. Their so 
calling and believing themselves was indeed for worldly causes; but as every cause comes forth from a cause prior to itself, and thus everything of cause in the natural world from a cause in the spiritual 
world, so also does this. The cause in the spiritual world was the heavenly marriage of good and truth, in which there are no other births than truths of faith and goods of charity. These there are 
"sons and daughters," and are also signified by "sons and daughters" in the Word. Whoever has not these births, that is, truths of faith and goods of charity, is as it were dead, that is, is among 
the dead who do not rise again to life or heaven. From this we may see what is signified by these words of Rachel: "If not, I am dead." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3908</b></p><p><b>3908.</b>
'If you do not, I am [in]' means that otherwise [the affection for interior truth] would not rise again. This is clear from the meaning of 'dying' as not rising again into life. In ancient times wives 
used to call themselves dead when they did not bear any son or daughter and also believed themselves to be so since no memory of them - no life so to speak - would remain for posterity. But the reason 
why they called and believed themselves to be such lay in fact in worldly causes. But since every cause is the manifestation of another cause prior to itself, and thus every aspect of a cause existing 
in the natural world is the product of a cause in the spiritual world, so too is the cause referred to. The cause existing in the spiritual world originated in the heavenly marriage of good and truth, 
in which marriage no other births take place than the truths of faith and the goods of charity. Those truths and goods are the sons and daughters born in that world, and are also meant by sons and 
daughters in the Word. Anyone who does not give birth to these - to the truths of faith and the goods of charity - is so to speak dead. For he belongs among the dead who do not rise again, that is to 
say, into life or heaven. From this one may see what is meant by Rachel's words, If you do not, I am dead. </p>

</p><b>3908.</b>
`Et si non, mortua ego': quod significet quod sic non resurgeret, constat ex significatione `mori' quod sit non resurgere in vitam; uxores antiquis temporibus se dicebant mortuas, cum non filium 
seu filiam parerent, et quoque se ut tales credebant; quia nulla sui memoria seu quasi vita, in posteritate relicta maneret; </p>
<p>sed quod tales se dicerent et crederent, erat quidem ob causas in mundo; 
sed quia omnis causa existit a causa priore se, ita omne causae in mundo naturali a causa in mundo spirituali, ita etiam haec; causa in mundo spirituali erat ex conjugio caelesti boni et veri, in 
quo partus non alii sunt quam vera fidei et bona charitatis, illa et haec ibi sunt filii et filiae, et quoque per filios et filias in Verbo significantur, {1}is cui illi partus, nempe vera fidei et 
bona charitatis, non sunt, quasi mortuus est,' hoc est, inter mortuos qui non resurgunt, nempe ad vitam seu caelum; inde constare potest quid per illa verba Rachelis `si non, mortua ego' significatur. @1 
qui partus nempe vera fidei et bona charitatis si non sint, quasi mortui sunt$ </p>
