<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9457节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9457.</strong>“耶和华晓谕摩西说”表关于将要被代表的天堂神圣事物的指示。这从接下来的经文清楚可知，因为耶和华晓谕摩西的事表示将要被代表的天堂的神圣事物。在以色列人当中，一个教会正在建立，其中外在形式以一种代表性的方式来展示属于爱之良善的属天事物，以及属于信之良善和真理的属灵事物，就是诸如存在于天堂，并且也应当存在于教会中的那类事物。由此明显可知，“耶和华晓谕”表示关于将要被代表的天堂神圣事物的指示。由于接下来描述的事物是在天堂来自主的属天和属灵事物，故有必要说一说何为代表性教会，以及它为何存在。<br />天堂有三层：至内层或第三层；中间或第二层；最低层或第一层。对主之爱的良善在至内层天堂掌权；对邻之仁的良善在中间天堂；在中间和至内层天堂所思、所言和产生的事物则在最低层天堂被代表。在这层天堂，代表是不计其数的，如天堂乐园、园子、森林、田野、平原，以及城市、宫殿和房屋；还有羊群和牛群，以及各种各样的动物和鸟类；此外还有无数其它现象。在该层天堂，这些事物就出现在天使灵眼前，比出现在地上正午之光中的类似事物更清晰；令人震惊的是，这些灵人还能认出所出现的事物表示什么真实事物。<br />当先知们的内视，也就是灵的视觉被打开时，这类现象也显现给他们；如撒迦利亚所看见的马（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚6.1.htm">6:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚6.8.htm">8</a>）；系基路伯的四活物，后来，但以理所看见的新殿和其中的一切事物（以西结书1，9，10，40-48章）；约翰所看见并在启示录中所描述的灯台、宝座、也是基路伯的活物、马、新耶路撒冷和其它许多事物；还有以利沙的仆人所看见的火马火车（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下6.17.htm">6:17</a>）。在天堂，诸如此类的事物不断出现在灵人和天使眼前。它们是属世形式，天堂的内在事物就终止于其中，并被赋予形状。以这种方式在灵人和天使的实际眼睛面前呈为可见的事物就是代表。<br />因此，当源于主并仰望主的爱与信的神圣内在事物通过世上的可见形式来呈现，如本章和接下来的几章所论述的事物，即柜子、施恩座、基路伯、那里的桌子、灯台和帐幕的其它一切事物时，一个代表性教会就会存在。因为这个帐幕是以这种方式建造的：它可以代表三层天堂和那里的一切事物；盛有法版的柜子代表至内层天堂和那里的主自己。这就是为何当摩西在山上被指示它应取的样式时，耶和华同时说，他们要为祂造个圣所，使祂可以住在他们中间（25:8）。凡具有一点深层次的思考能力的人都能明白，耶和华不可能住在一个帐幕中；相反，祂住在天堂；这个帐幕也不可能被称为一个圣所，除非它表现天堂的形像，以及那里的属天和属灵事物。让每个人都扪心自问，如果不是天堂和天堂的事物在那里以外在形式被代表，耶和华，天地的创造者会住在一个用黄金包裹、用帘子围上的木制小居所吗？<br />因为以外在形式被代表的事物的确以类似形式出现在最低层或第一层天堂，出现在那里的灵人面前；但在高层天堂的人却感知被代表的内在事物，这些事物就是属于对主之爱的属天事物和属于对主之信的属灵事物。当摩西和百姓被外在圣洁打动，崇拜帐幕如同耶和华自己的居所时，充满天堂的，正是这种性质的事物。由此明显可知何为一个代表，以及天堂，因而主通过它而与人类同在。<br />所以当古教会完结时，一个代表性教会在以色列人当中建立，以便通过这些代表，天堂，因而主能与人类结合。如果主不通过天堂与人们结合，他们将不复存在；因为人们正是凭这种结合而拥有自己的生命。然而，这些代表只是服务于结合的外在手段，主以神奇的方式将天堂与这些代表相结合（参看<a href="4311.htm">4311</a>节）。但当通过这些手段所实现的结合即将灭亡时，主就降世，打开被代表的内在事物本身，也就是属于对主之爱和信的内在事物。现在实现这种结合的，是这些内在事物。不过，如今实现这种结合的唯一手段仍是圣言，因为圣言是以这种方式写成的：它的每一个部分都有一个对应关系，因而代表并表示存在于诸天堂的神性事物。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9457</b></p><p><b>9457.</b>
And Jehovah spoke unto Moses, saying. That this signifies instruction concerning the holy things of heaven that were to be represented, is evident from what follows; for by "what Jehovah spoke unto Moses" 
are signified the holy things of heaven that were to be represented. For among the Israelitish people there was instituted a church in which were to be representatively presented in an external 
form the celestial things of the good of love and the spiritual things of the good and truth of faith, such as are in heaven, and such as must be in the church. From this it is evident that by "Jehovah 
spoke," is signified instruction concerning the holy things of heaven that were to be represented. Inasmuch as the things that follow are representative of the celestial and spiritual things which are 
in the heavens from the Lord, it shall be told what a representative church is, and why it was instituted. [2] There are three heavens: the inmost or third; the middle or second; and the ultimate 
or first. In the inmost heaven reigns the good of love to the Lord; in the middle heaven, the good of charity toward the neighbor; and in the ultimate heaven are represented the things which are thought, 
said, and come forth in the middle and inmost heavens. The representatives in this heaven are countless, consisting of paradises, gardens, forests, fields, plains; also of cities, palaces, houses; 
likewise of flocks and herds, animals and birds of many kinds, besides numberless other things. These things appear before the eyes of the angelic spirits there more clearly than similar things appear 
in the light of noon on earth; and wonderful to say, their signification also is perceived.  [3] Such things appeared also to the prophets when their interior sight, which is the sight of the spirit, 
was opened; as horses to Zechariah (Zech. 6:1-8); animals that were cherubs, and afterward the new temple with all things belonging to it, to Ezekiel (Ezek. 1, 9, 10, 40-48); a lampstand, thrones, 
animals that also were cherubs, horses, the New Jerusalem, and many other things, to John, as described in Revelation; in like manner horses and chariots of fire to the young man of Elisha (2 Kings 6:17). 
Things like these appear constantly in heaven before the eyes of spirits and angels, and they are natural forms in which the internal things of heaven terminate, and in which they are portrayed, 
and are thus presented to view before the very eyes. These things are representations. [4] A church is therefore representative when the internal holy things of love and faith from the Lord and to the 
Lord are presented to view by means of forms visible in the world; as in this chapter and the following by the ark, the propitiatory[mercy seat], the cherubs, the tables there, the lampstand, and all 
the other things of the tabernacle. For this tabernacle was so constructed as to represent the three heavens and all things therein; and the ark, in which was the Testimony, so as to represent the inmost 
heaven and the Lord Himself therein. Wherefore its form was shown to Moses in the mountain, Jehovah then saying that they should "make for Him a sanctuary, and He would dwell in the midst of them" 
(verse 8). Everyone who has some capacity of thinking interiorly can perceive that Jehovah could not dwell in a tent, but that He dwells in heaven; and that this tent could not be called a sanctuary 
unless it referred to heaven, and to the celestial and spiritual things therein. Consider what it would be for Jehovah, the Creator of heaven and earth, to dwell in a small habitation of wood, overlaid 
with gold and surrounded with curtains, unless heaven and the things of heaven had been there represented in a form. [5] For the things represented in a form do indeed appear in a like form in the 
lowest or first heaven before the spirits who are there; but in the higher heavens are perceived the internal things which are represented, and which as before said are the celestial things of love to 
the Lord, and the spiritual things of faith in the Lord. Such were the things that filled heaven when Moses and the people were in a holy external, and adored this tent as the habitation of Jehovah 
Himself. From this it is plain what a representative is, and also that through it heaven, thus the Lord, was present with man.  [6] Therefore when the Ancient Church ceased, a representative church was 
instituted among the Israelitish people, in order that by means of such representatives there might be the conjunction of heaven, thus of the Lord, with the human race; for without the conjunction 
of the Lord through heaven, man would perish, because he has his life by virtue of this conjunction. These representatives, however, were only external means of conjunction, with which the Lord miraculously 
conjoined heaven (see n. 4311). But when the conjunction through these things also perished, the Lord came into the world and opened the internal things themselves that were represented, which 
are those of love and faith in Him. These internal things now effect the conjunction; nevertheless at the present day the only means of conjunction is the Word, because it has been so written that each 
and all things therein correspond, and thus represent and signify the Divine things that are in the heavens. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9457</b></p><p><b>9457.</b>
'And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying' means instructions regarding the holy things of heaven which had to be represented. This is clear from the verses that follow, for the things which Jehovah told Moses 
mean the holy things of heaven that were to be represented. Among the Israelite people a Church was being established in which outward forms would exist displaying in a representative fashion the 
celestial realities belonging to the good of love, and the spiritual realities belonging to the good and truth of faith, as such realities exist in heaven and ought to do so in the Church. From all this 
it is clear that 'Jehovah spoke' means instructions regarding the holy things of heaven which had to be represented. Since the matters described in the verses that follow are representative of the 
celestial and spiritual realities from the Lord in the heavens, something needs to be said about what a representative Church is and why it exists.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 There are three heavens - the inmost or third, 
the middle or second, and the lowest or first. In the inmost heaven the good of love to the Lord reigns, in the middle heaven the good of charity towards the neighbour reigns, and in the lowest the 
things which are thought, spoken, and come into being in the middle and inmost heavens are represented. The representatives there are countless, such as paradise parks, gardens, forests, fields, plains, 
as well as cities, palaces, and houses; also flocks and herds, as well as very many kinds of animals and birds; and countless other phenomena. These appear before the eyes of angelic spirits in that 
heaven more plainly than any such things do on earth in the light at midday; and what is astonishing, those spirits also discern what realities are meant by the things which appear.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Such phenomena 
also appeared to prophets when their inner sight, which is the sight of the spirit, had been opened, for instance the horses that appeared to <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zechariah%206:1-8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zechariah 6:1-8</a>; the living creatures which were 
cherubs, and afterwards the new temple and everything in it that appeared to Ezekiel, Chapters <a href="1.htm">1</a>, <a href="9.htm">9</a>, <a href="10.htm">10</a>, <a href="40.htm">40</a>-<a href="48.htm">48</a>; the lampstand, thrones, living creatures (which again were cherubs), horses, new Jerusalem, 
and very many other phenomena, which appeared to John and are described in the Book of Revelation; and similarly the fiery horses and chariots that appeared to Elisha's servant, <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 6:17. Things 
such as these are constantly making their appearance in heaven before the eyes of spirits and angels. They are natural forms in which the inward things of heaven terminate and are given shape. The 
things which present themselves visually before the spirits and angels' actual eyes in this way are representations.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 A representative Church exists therefore when the holy, inner realities of 
love and faith which are derived from the Lord and look towards the Lord present themselves by means of visual forms in the world, such as those which are the subject in this and following chapters - 
the ark, the mercy-seat, the cherubs, the tables there, the lampstand, and everything else that was part of the tabernacle. For that tabernacle was constructed in such a way that it might represent the 
three heavens and everything there, the ark which contained the Testimony representing the inmost heaven and the Lord Himself there. This is why, when Moses was shown on the mountain the form it should 
take, Jehovah said at the same time, To the end that they may make for Him a sanctuary and He may dwell in their midst, verse 8. Everyone endowed with any ability to think on a deeper level can see 
that Jehovah could not have dwelt in a tent but that He dwells in heaven, and that this tent is called the sanctuary only because it presents an image of heaven, and the celestial and spiritual realities 
there. Let everyone ask himself, What would it have been for Jehovah, Creator of heaven and earth, to dwell in a small dwelling-place that was made of wood, overlaid with gold, and surrounded by 
curtains, if heaven and the things of heaven had not been represented there in outward forms? </p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 For the realities which are represented in outward forms do indeed reveal themselves in a similar way 
in the lowest or first heaven before the spirits there. But those in the higher heavens perceive the inner things that are being represented, which, as has been stated, are the celestial realities belonging 
to love to the Lord and the spiritual realities belonging to faith in the Lord. It was things of this nature that filled heaven when Moses and the people, moved by outward holiness, venerated 
that tent as the dwelling-place of Jehovah Himself. From this it is evident what a representative was, and also that by means of it heaven, and so the Lord, was present with mankind.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 A representative 
Church therefore was established among the Israelite people, when the ancient Church came to an end, in order that by means of such representatives heaven, and so the Lord, might be joined to 
the human race. (If the Lord did not join Himself to people through heaven they would cease to exist; for it is as a result of this joining of Himself to them that people possess the life they have.) 
Those representatives however were no more than outward means serving to conjoin, yet to which the Lord joined heaven in a wondrous manner, <a href="4311.htm">4311</a>. But when the joining together through those means also 
was about to perish the Lord came into the world and laid bare the actual realities which were being merely represented up to then, that is, the inner realities which belong to love to and faith in 
Him. These realities themselves now effect that joining together. But the only means by which such a joining together is effected at the present day is still the Word, since this has been written in such 
a way that every single part of it has a correspondence and as a consequence represents and serves to mean the Divine realities present in the heavens.  </p>

`Et locutus est Jehovah ad Moschen, dicendo': quod significet informationem de sanctis caeli quae repraesentanda, constat ex illis quae sequuntur, nam quae locutus est Jehovah ad Moschen sunt sancta 
caeli quae repraesentarentur; instituebatur enim apud populum Israeliticum Ecclesia in qua in externa forma sisterentur repraesentative caelestia, quae sunt boni amoris, et spiritualia, quae sunt boni 
et veri fidei, qualia sunt in caelo, et qualia erunt in Ecclesia; ex quibus constat quod per `locutus est Jehovah' significetur informatio de sanctis caeli quae repraesentanda. Quoniam illa quae sequuntur 
sunt repraesentativa caelestium et spiritualium quae a Domino in caelis, ideo dicetur quid Ecclesia repraesentativa et cur illa: sunt tres caeli, intimum seu 2 tertium, medium seu secundum, ac 
ultimum seu primum; in intimo caelo regnat bonum amoris in Dominum, in medio caelo regnat bonum {1}charitatis erga proximum, {2} in ultimo repraesentantur illa quae in medio ac intimo caelo cogitantur, 
dicuntur, et existunt; repraesentativa quae ibi sunt innumerabilia, sicut paradisi, horti, silvae, agri, campi, tum urbes, palatia, domus, ut et greges et armenta, tum animalia et aves plurium generum, 
praeter {3}innumeralia; haec apparent coram oculis spirituum angelicorum ibi clarius quam similia in luce medii diei in tellure, et quod mirum, appercipitur etiam quid 3 significant; (m)talia etiam 
apparuerunt prophetis quando interior eorum visus, qui est visus spiritus, apertus fuit, sicut equi Sachariae, vi 1-(x)8; animalia quae cherubi, {4}et dein novum templum cum omnibus ejus, Ezechieli, 
i, ix, x, xl-xlviii; candelabrum, throni, animalia quae etiam cherubi, equi, nova Hierosolyma, {5}et plura alia, Johanni, de quibus in Apocalypsi; similiter equi et currus ignei puero Elisaei, 2 Reg. 
vi 17; similia apparent continue in caelo {6}coram oculis spirituum et angelorum,(n) {7}et sunt formae naturales in quas interna caeli desinunt et in quibus figurantur, quae sic sistuntur visibiles coram 
ipsis oculis, haec sunt 4 repraesentationes; Ecclesia itaque repraesentativa est cum sancta interna, quae sunt amoris et fidei a Domino et in Dominum, sistuntur per formas visibiles in mundo, sicut 
in hoc capite et in sequentibus, per arcam, propitiatorium, cherubos, per mensas ibi, per candelabrum, et per reliqua tabernaculi; tabernaculum enim illud ita construebatur ut repraesentaret tres caelos, 
et omnia quae ibi; et {8} arca, in qua testimonium, caelum intimum, ac Ipsum Dominum ibi; quapropter forma ejus ostensa est Moschi in monte, dicente tunc Jehovah, Ut faciant sibi sanctuarium, et 
habitet in medio illorum, vers. 8; quisque qui aliqua facultate interius cogitandi pollet percipere potest quod Jehovah non habitare potuerit in tentorio, sed quod in caelo, et quod tentorium illud 
non dicatur sanctuarium nisi referat caelum, (c)ac caelestia (c)et (x)spiritualia quae ibi; cogitet quisque secum, {9}quid foret pro Jehovah Creatore caeli et terrae habitare in parvo habitaculo facto 
ex lignis, obducto auro, et circumtecto aulaeis, nisi caelum, et quae caeli sunt, 5repraesentata ibi fuissent in forma? quae enim (x)repraesentantur in forma, illa quidem in simili apparent in ultimo 
seu primo caelo coram spiritibus qui ibi, sed in caelis superioribus percipiuntur interna quae repraesentantur, quae, ut dictum est, sunt caelestia quae amoris in Dominum, et spiritualia quae sunt fidei 
in Dominum; talia {10}erant quae implebant caelum quando Moscheh cum populo in sancto externo erant, et adorabant id sicut habitaculum Ipsius Jehovae; inde patet quid repraesentativum, tum quod per 
id esset caelum praesens apud hominem, ita Dominus. 	Ecclesia itaque repraesentativa, cum desiit antiqua, instituta est 6 apud populum Israeliticum ut per talia conjunctio esset caeli, ita Domini cum 
humano genere, nam absque conjunctione Domini per caelum, periret homo, homo enim ex conjunctione illa vitam suam habet; sed repraesentativa illa erant solum media conjunctionis externa cum quibus 
Dominus miraculose conjunxit caelum, n. 4311; at cum per illa quoque conjunctio periret, tunc Dominus in mundum venit, et aperuit ipsa interna quae repraesentabantur, quae sunt amoris et fidei in Ipsum; 
haec nunc conjungunt; sed usque unicum medium conjunctionis hodie est Verbum, quoniam id ita conscriptum est ut omnia et singula ibi correspondeant, {11}et inde repraesentent et significent Divina 
quae in caelis. @1 fidei in Dominum$ @2 i et$ @3 innumera alia$ @4 tum$ @5 praeter$ @6 ultimo$ @7 haec$ @8 i ipsa$ @9 quod$ @10 sunt$ @11 proinde$ </p>
