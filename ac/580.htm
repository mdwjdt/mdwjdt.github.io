<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>580.</strong>创世记6:4 那时候有伟人在地上。后来神的众子和人的众女交合生子，那就是上古英武有名的人。<br />“伟人”是指那些由于认定自己高尚优越而无视一切神圣与真实之物的人。“后来神的众子和人的众女交合生子”表示当他们将信的教义事物浸没于自己的恶欲、形成虚假的信念时，就会出现这种情况。他们就是基于我欲的所谓“勇士”。“那就是上古英武有名的人”表示这种人以前就存在过。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]580.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_580/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_4" target=_top>Genesis 6:4</a>. The Nephilim were in the land in those days and for a very long time after the sons of God went in to the daughters of humankind, who bore children to them. These were mighty men, who for ages had been men with a name.<br />The Nephilim symbolize those who placed no value on anything holy or true because of delusions about their own importance and superiority. For a very long time after the sons of God went in to the daughters of humankind, who bore children to them, means that they became so at the point when they merged the teachings about faith with their appetites and convinced themselves of false ideas. They are called mighty men from their love for themselves. For ages they had been men with a name means that they had been like this before as well. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 580</b></p><p><b>580.</b>
Verse 4. There were Nephilim in the earth in those days; and especially after the sons of God went in unto the daughters of man, and they bare to them, the same became mighty men, who were of old, men 
of renown. By "Nephilim" are signified those who through a persuasion of their own loftiness and preeminence made light of all things holy and true; "and especially after the sons of God went in unto 
the daughters of man, and they bare to them" signifies that this occurred when they immersed the doctrinals of faith in their cupidities, and formed persuasions of what is false; they are called "mighty 
men" from their love of self; "of old, men of renown" signifies that there had been such before. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 580</b></p><p><b>580.</b>
Verse 4 The Nephilim were in the land in those days, very much so after the sons of God went in to the daughters of man, who bore children to them; they were mighty men (vir) who from of old were men 
(vir) of the name.  </p>
<p>'The Nephilim' means those who, persuaded of their own prominence and superiority, treated everything holy and true as being worthless. 'Very much so after the sons of God went 
in to the daughters of man, who bore children to them' means at that time when they immersed doctrinal matters concerning faith in their own evil desires and formed false persuasions. They are called 
'mighty men' on account of their self-love, and 'from of old, men of the name' means that such people had also existed previously.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 580</b>
</p><b>580.</b>
Vers. 4.  Nephilim fuerunt in terra in diebus istis, et quam maxime postquam intrabant filii Dei ad filias hominis, et genuerunt eis; hi viri fortes, qui a saeculo viri nominis.  Per 'Nephilim' significantur 
qui ex persuasione suae altitudinis et praeeminentiae nihili fecerunt omnia sancta et vera: 'quam maxime postquam intrarunt filii Dei ad filias hominis et genuerunt eis' significat quod tunc, 
cum doctrinalia fidei immerserint suis cupiditatibus, et persuasiones falsi formaverint: 'viri fortes' vocantur ex amore sui; 'a saeculo viri nominis' significat quod prius quoque tales fuerint. </p>
