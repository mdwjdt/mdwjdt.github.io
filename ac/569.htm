<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第569节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>569.</strong>创世记6:2 神的众子看见人的众女美丽，就随意挑选，娶作妻子。<br />“神的众子”表信的教义事项，而此处的“众女”和前面一样，表恶欲。“神的众子看见人的众女美丽，就随意挑选，娶作妻子”表示他们将信的教义事项与恶欲联结起来，事实上，与所有恶欲联结起来。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]569.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_569/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_2" target=_top>Genesis 6:2</a>. And the sons of God saw the daughters of humankind, that they were good, and they took wives for themselves from among all whom they chose.<br />The sons of God symbolize the teachings of faith. Daughters here as before symbolize cravings. The sons of God saw the daughters of humankind, that they were good, and they took wives for themselves from among all whom they chose, means that they forged ties between the teachings of faith and their own appetites — appetites of any kind whatever. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 569</b></p><p><b>569.</b>
Verse 2. And the sons of God saw the daughters of man that they were good, and they took to themselves wives of all that they chose. By the "sons of God" are signified the doctrinal things of faith. 
By "daughters" here as before, cupidities. By the "sons of God seeing the daughters of man that they were good, and taking to themselves wives of all that they chose" is signified that the doctrinal things 
of faith conjoined themselves with cupidities, in fact with any cupidities whatever. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 569</b></p><p><b>569.</b>
Verse 2 And the sons of God saw the daughters of man that they were fair, and took wives for themselves from all whom they chose.  </p>
<p>'The sons of God' means doctrinal matters concerning faith, while 
'daughters' here, as previously, means evil desires. 'The sons of God saw the daughters of man that they were fair, and took wives for themselves from all whom they chose' means that they joined doctrinal 
matters concerning faith to evil desires, indeed to every such desire.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 569</b>
</p><b>569.</b>
Vers. 2.  Et viderunt filii Dei {x}filias hominis, quod bonae illae, et acceperunt sibi uxores ab omnibus quas eligebant.  Per 'filios Dei' significantur doctrinalia fidei: per 'filias' hic ut prius, 
cupiditates: 'quod filii Dei viderint filias hominis quod bonae, et acceperint sibi uxores ab omnibus quas eligebant' significat quod doctrinalia fidei conjunxerint cum cupiditatibus, et quidem cum 
quibuscumque. </p>
