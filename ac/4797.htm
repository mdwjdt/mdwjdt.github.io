<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4797节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4797.</strong>情感状态的变化活生生地显现在天使的脸上，当他们在自己的社群中时，就处于自己的脸；但当他们进入别的社群时，他们的脸就照着对该社群的良善与真理的情感而发生变化。然而，他们自己那真正的脸如同一个平面或基本面，在所发生的这一切变化里面可以被辨认出来。我曾亲眼目睹过与他们所交流社群的情感相一致的连续变化，因为每一位天使都在大人的某个区域中，因而与处于同一区域的所有人有普遍而广泛的交流，尽管他自己也在他所具体对应的该区域的一个部分中。我见过他们通过从情感这一极变到另一极而使自己的脸发生变化；然而，我发现他们的脸总体上保持不变，以便主导情感在他们的每一个<br />变化中闪耀出来。因此，他们的脸全方位地展现全部情感。<br />更为神奇的是，情感从幼年到成年所经历的变化也通过脸的变化来展现。我被允许看到幼儿的东西有多少能被保存到成年，正是幼儿的东西将人性本身赋予成年。因为外在形式的纯真就存在于幼儿里面，而纯真就是人性本身；事实上，纯真可以说是爱与仁能从主流入其中的基本属性。当人正在重生，变得智慧时，外在的幼儿纯真就变得内在。正因如此，真正的智慧只居于纯真（参看<a href="2305.htm">2305</a>，<a href="2306.htm">2306</a>，<a href="3183.htm">3183</a>，<a href="3994.htm">3994</a>节）；而且，没有人能进入天堂，除非他拥有某种纯真，正如主所说：]<br />你们若不变成小孩子的样式，断不得进天国。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太18.3.htm">18:3</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.15.htm">10:15</a>）</p>

The changes of state of the affections appear to the life in the face of angels. When they are in their own society they are in their own face, but when they come into another society their faces are 
changed according to the affections of good and truth of that society; and yet the genuine face is as a plane, which is recognized in these changes. I have seen the successive variations according to 
the affections of the societies with which they were communicating, for every angel is in some province of the Grand Man, and thus communicates generally and widely with all who are in the same province, 
though he himself is in the part of that province to which he properly corresponds. I have seen that they varied their faces by changes from one limit of affection to another; but it was observed 
that the same face in general was retained, so that the ruling affection always shone forth with its variations, and thus the faces of the whole affection in its extension were shown. [2] And what is 
more wonderful, the changes of affections from infancy even to adult age were also shown by means of variations of the face, and it was given me to know how much of infancy it had retained in adult 
age, and that this was the human itself of it. For in an infant there is innocence in external form, and innocence is the human itself, for into it as into a plane flow love and charity from the Lord. 
When man is being regenerated and becoming wise, the innocence of infancy, which was external, becomes internal. It is for this reason that genuine wisdom dwells in no other abode than innocence (see 
n. 2305, 2306, 3183, 3994); also that no one can enter heaven unless he has something of innocence, according to the Lord's words, "Except ye become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom 
of the heavens" (Matt. 18:3; Mark 10:15). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4797</b></p><p><b>4797.</b>
The changes that take place in the state of their affections are also clearly visible in angels' faces. When they are in their own community the face they present is their own particular one; but when 
they enter another community the affections for goodness and truth belonging to this other community bring a change to their faces. Yet their own true face is so to speak the basic surface, which is 
identifiable within all the changes that take place. I have witnessed the consecutive variations taking place in keeping with the affections of the communities with which they were communicating. For 
every angel is in some province of the Grand Man and so communicates generally and widely with all throughout the same province, even though he is in one part of that province to which he specifically 
corresponds. I have seen them bringing variations to their faces by changing from one border-line of affection to another; yet I observed that they preserved the same faces in general, so that the ruling 
affection shone out in every variation of them. Thus their faces displayed the full range of that entire affection. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 And what was quite astonishing, the changes which affections undergo from 
young childhood to adult life were also shown by variations in the face. I was allowed to see how much of young childhood was preserved in adult life, and that it was this that gave adult life its 
essentially human quality. For innocence - the external form of it - is present in a young child, and innocence constitutes that essentially human quality; indeed innocence is so to speak the basic attribute 
into which love and charity from the Lord can enter. When a person is being regenerated and becoming wise the innocence of infancy which has been external becomes internal. Consequently true wisdom 
resides in no other abode than innocence, <a href="2305.htm">2305</a>, <a href="2306.htm">2306</a>, <a href="3183.htm">3183</a>, <a href="3994.htm">3994</a>; also, no one can enter heaven except one who has some degree of innocence, according to the Lord's words, </p>

Unless you become as 
young children you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2018:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 18:3</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2010:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 10:15</a>.

Mutationes status affectionum in facie angelorum etiam ad vivum apparent; eum in sua societate sunt, tunc in sua facie sunt, at eum in aliam societatem veniunt, tunc secundum affectiones boni et 
veri illius societatis mutantur facies illorum, at usque genuina facies est sicut planum, quae {1} mutationibus illis cognoscitur; </p>
<p>variationes vidi successivas secundum affectiones societatum eum quibus 
communicabant; nam unusquisque angelus est provincia quadam Maximi Hominis, et sic communiter et late communicat cum omnibus qui {2} in eadem provincia, tametsi is in parte istius provinciae est 
cui is proprie correspondet. Vidi quod facies suas variarent per mutationes ab uno limite affectionis ad alterum, sed observatum quod usque eadem fac in genere retineretur, sic ut eluceret semper affectio 
dominans cum ejus variationibus; ita ostensae sunt facies totius affectionis in sua extensione {3}.  (s)Et quod mirabilius, etiam ostensae sunt mutationes affectionum ab infantia usque ad adultam 
aetatem per variationes faciei; et dabatur cognoscere in hac aetate quantum infantiae retinuerat, et quod haec esset ipsum ejus humanum; apud infantem enim est innocentia in externa forma, et 
innocentia est ipsum humanum, in illam enim ut in planum influit amor et charitas a Domino; cum regeneratur homo et fit sapiens, tunc innocentia infantiae quae fuit externa, fit interna {4}; inde est 
quod genuina sapientia non in alia aede quam in innocentia habitet, n. 2305, 2306, 3183, 3994; tum quod nemo nisi qui aliquid innocentiae habet {5}, intrare possit in caelum, secundum Domini verba,  
         Nisi fiatis sicut infantes, non ingrediemini in regnum      caelorum Matth. xviii 3; Marc. x 15. (s)      @1 i etiam$      @2 quae probably referring to societates$      @3 extenso$
