<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">（一）经文</h4><br />（1）神记念挪亚和同他在方舟里的一切野兽和一切牲畜。神使风吹地，水势渐落。<br />（2）深渊的泉源和天上的水闸都关闭了，天上的雨也止住了。<br />（3）水从地上来回渐退，过了一百五十天，水就消退了。<br />（4）七月十七日，方舟停在亚拉腊山上。<br />（5）水向下流、不断减退，直到十月；到了十月初一，山顶都露出来了。<br />（6）过了四十天，挪亚开了他所造的方舟的窗户。<br />（7）他放出一只乌鸦，那乌鸦飞来飞去，直到水在地上都干了。<br />（8）他又从他自己那里放出一只鸽子，要看看水从土地面上减退没有。<br />（9）鸽子找不着落脚之地，就回到方舟挪亚那里，因为整个地面上都是水，挪亚伸手抓住鸽子，把它带到自己这里进入方舟。<br />（10）他又等了七天，再继续把鸽子从方舟放出去。<br />（11）到了晚上，鸽子回到他那里，看哪，嘴里衔着一片啄下来的橄榄叶。挪亚就知道水从地上退了。<br />（12）他又等了七天，放出鸽子，鸽子就再没有回到他那里。<br />（13）到挪亚六百零一岁，正月初一日一开始，地上的水都干了，挪亚移开方舟的盖观看，看哪，土地面干了。<br />（14）到了二月二十七日，地就都干了。<br />（15）神向挪亚讲话，说：<br />（16）你和你的妻子，你的儿子和儿媳都要和你出方舟。<br />（17）和你在一起凡有血肉的一切野兽，就是飞鸟、牲畜和一切爬在地上的爬行物，你也要带出来，叫它们分散到地上结果，在地上繁殖。<br />（18）于是，挪亚出来了，他的儿子、妻子和儿媳都与他一起出来了。<br />（19）一切野兽，一切爬行物，一切飞鸟和一切爬在地上的物，各从其类，它们也都出了方舟。<br />（20）挪亚筑了一座祭坛给耶和华，拿各类洁净的牲畜、各类洁净的飞鸟献在祭坛上为燔祭。<br />（21）耶和华闻了那安息的气味，耶和华就心里说：“我不再因人的缘故咒诅土地，因为人心的妄想从小就是邪恶。我也再不照我所作的打击一切生物了。<br />（22）尽地所有的日子，播种与收割、冷与热、夏与冬、昼与夜，就永不停息了。<br /><br /><h4 align="center">（二）概览</h4><br /><strong>832.</strong>按照上下文，接下来的主题是被称为“挪亚”的新教会成员；事实上，主题是他受试探后直到重生，以及之后的状态。</p>

And God remembered Noah, and every wild animal and every beast that was with him in the ark. And God made a wind pass over the earth, and the waters subsided.<br />2. And the springs of the abyss and the floodgates of heaven were stopped up, and the downpour from the sky was held back.<br />3. And the waters receded off the earth, going and coming back, and the waters disappeared at the end of one hundred fifty days.<br />4. And the ark came to rest in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat.<br />5. And the waters were going and disappearing till the tenth month; in the tenth [month], on the first of the month, the heads of the mountains appeared.<br />6. And it happened at the end of forty days that Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made.<br />7. And he sent out a raven, and it went out, going and coming back till the water dried up off the earth.<br />8. And he sent a dove out from him, to see whether the water might have lessened off the face of the ground.<br />9. And the dove did not find a resting place for the sole of its foot, and it returned to him, to the ark, because there was water over the face of the whole earth; and he put his hand out and took it and brought it in to himself, into the ark.<br />10. And he waited yet another seven days and proceeded to send the dove out from the ark.<br />11. And the dove returned to him at evening time, and look: the torn-off leaf of an olive tree in its mouth! And Noah realized that the water had lessened off the earth.<br />12. And he waited yet another seven days and sent a dove out, and it never returned to him again.<br />13. And it happened in the six hundred first year, in the beginning, on the first of the month, that the water drained off the earth; and Noah removed the roof of the ark and looked, and indeed the face of the ground had dried up!<br />14. In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth dried up.<br />15. And God spoke to Noah, saying,<br />16. "Go out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and your sons' wives with you,<br />17. every wild animal that is with you, of all flesh, including the bird and the beast and every creeping thing creeping on the earth. Take them out with you, and let them swarm throughout the earth and reproduce and multiply on the earth."<br />18. And Noah went out, as did his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him,<br />19. every wild animal, every creeping thing, and every bird — everything creeping on the earth. By their families they went out of the ark.<br />20. And Noah built an altar to Jehovah and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar.<br />21. And Jehovah smelled a restful smell, and Jehovah said in his heart, "I will never again curse the ground on the human being's account, because what human hearts fabricate is evil from their youth. And I will never again strike every living thing as I have done.<br />22. Throughout all the days of the earth to come, sowing and reaping and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night will not end."<br /><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_832/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_959" target=_top>959</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_832/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1983" target=_top>1983</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_832/swedenborg_conjugial-love-rogers_505#subsection-2-2" target=_top>Marriage Love 505:2</a>; and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_832/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_80" target=_top>True Christianity 80:1</a>.
