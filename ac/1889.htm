<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1889节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>1889．本章亚伯兰、撒莱、夏甲、以实玛利的名字也一样。这些名字所包含的事物从概览和下文对每个名字的解读清楚可知。然而，它们都是诸如难以轻易理性解读的那类事物。因为这些名字所论及的主题是主的理性，它如何被孕育和生出，以及在它与主的内在，就是耶和华联结之前具有什么样的性质。这个主题无法轻易理性解读出来，原因在于：现在的人不知道何为内在人，何为内层人或外层人。若论及理性或理性人，人们或许对它有某种概念。但若说理性介于内在和外在之间，就很少有人理解了。然而，就内义而言，此处所论述的主题是主的理性人，以及它如何经由内在人进入外在人的流注被孕育和生出，而这些问题就包含在有关亚伯兰、夏甲、以实玛利的历史事件中。所以，为防止下面的解读变得令人费解、不可思议，有必要让人们知道：每个人都有一个内在人，一个介于中间的理性人，和一个外在人。这三者截然不同，彼此分离。关于这些问题，可参看前文（<a href="978.htm">978</a>节）。</p>

In this chapter it is the same with the names Abram, Sarai, Hagar, and Ishmael; and what they involve may be seen from the CONTENTS, and further on from the explication of each name in its place. But 
these matters are of a nature that does not admit of easy explication, for the subject treated of in connection with these names is the Lord's rational, and how it was conceived and born, and what its 
quality was before it was united to the Lord's Internal, which was Jehovah. The reason why this subject is not of easy explication, is that at this day it is not known what the internal man is, what 
the interior, and what the exterior. When the rational is spoken of, or the rational man, some idea can be formed of it; but when it is said that the rational is the intermediate between the internal 
and the external, few if any comprehend it. Yet as the subject here treated of in the internal sense is the Lord's Rational Man, and how it was conceived and born by the influx of the internal man into 
the external, and as it is these very matters that are involved in the historical facts stated concerning Abram, Hagar, and Ishmael, therefore in order to prevent what we have to say in the following 
explication from being utterly unintelligible, be it known that in every man there is an internal man, a rational man which is intermediate, and an external man, and that these are most distinct from 
one another. (Concerning this subject see what was said above, n. 978.)             GENESIS 16      1. And Sarai, Abram's wife, did not bear unto him; and she had a handmaid, an Egyptian, and her 
name was Hagar.      2. And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold I pray, Jehovah hath shut me up from bearing; go in I pray unto my handmaid; it may be that I shall be built up by her. And Abram harkened 
to the voice of Sarai.      3. And Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, after ten years of Abram's dwelling in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram, her man, for a woman to 
him.       4. And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived; and she saw that she had conceived, and her mistress was despised in her eyes.      5. And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee; 
I gave my handmaid unto thy bosom; and she saw that she conceived, and I am despised in her eyes; Jehovah judge between me and thee.      6. And Abram said unto Sarai, Behold thy handmaid is in thy 
hand, do to her that which is good in thine eyes; and Sarai humbled her, and she fled from her face.      7. And the Angel of Jehovah found her by a fountain of waters in the wilderness, by the fountain 
in the way to Shur.      8. And he said, Hagar, Sarai's handmaid, whence comest thou? and whither goest thou? And she said, From the face of Sarai, my mistress, am I fleeing.      9. And the Angel 
of Jehovah said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and humble thyself under her hands.      10. And the Angel of Jehovah said unto her, In multiplying I will multiply thy seed, and it shall not be 
numbered for multitude.      11. And the Angel of Jehovah said unto her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son, and thou shalt call his name Ishmael; because Jehovah hath heard thine affliction.  
    12. And he will be a wild-ass man; his hand against all, and the hand of all against him and he shall dwell against the faces of all his brethren.      13. And she called the name of Jehovah 
that was speaking unto her, Thou God seest me; for she said, Have I also here seen after Him that seeth me?      14. Therefore she called the fountain, The fountain of the Living One who seeth 
me; behold it is between Kadesh and Bared.      15. And Hagar bare Abram a son; and Abram called the name of his son that Hagar bare, Ishmael.      16. And Abram was a son of eighty years and six years, 
when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram. </p>

It is similar in this chapter with the names Abram, Sarai, Hagar, and Ishmael. What these include within themselves becomes clear from the Contents and after that from the explanation of each name in 
what follows. They are however things such as cannot be explained easily and intelligibly, for the subject covered by those names is the Lord's Rational - how it was conceived and born, and the nature 
of it before it had been united to the Lord's Internal, which was Jehovah. The reason this cannot be explained easily and intelligibly is that people at the present day do not know what the internal 
man is, what the interior man is, or what the exterior man is. When one speaks of the rational or of the rational man some idea can be formed of these, but when one speaks of the rational as that which 
lies between the internal and the external, few if any can grasp it. Nevertheless since the subject in the internal sense of this chapter is the way in which the Lord's Rational Man was conceived and 
born from an influx of the Internal Man into the External Man - for this is the subject embodied within the historical descriptions involving Abram, Hagar, and Ishmael and yet to prevent the ideas 
presented in the explanation that follows from becoming utterly strange and unintelligible, let it be recognized that with everyone there exists an internal man, there exists a rational man which is situated 
in between, and there exists an external man, and that these three are quite distinct and separate from one another. For these matters see what has been stated already in <a href="978.htm">978</a>. </p>

Similiter se habet in hoc capite cum nominibus Abrami, Sarai, Hagaris et Ismaelis; quae autem illa involvunt, constare potest a Contentis, dein ab explicatione singulorum in sequentibus; sed talia sunt 
quae non facile ad captum explicari possunt; agitur enim sub illis de Rationali Domini quomodo illud conceptum et natum, et quale fiat antequam unitum Domini Interno, quod erat Jehovah quod non facile 
ad captum explicabile sit, causa est quia hodie non scitur quid internus homo, quid interior, et quid exterior; cum dicitur `rationale,' aut `rationalis homo,' tunc aliqua idea habetur, at cum dicitur 
quod rationale sit medium inter internum et externum, hoc pauci si ulli capiunt; sed usque quia in sensu interno hic agitur de Rationali Homine apud Dominum quomodo conceptus et natus ab Interni 
Hominis influxu in Externum, et haec sunt quae historica de Abramo, Hagare et Ismaele involvunt, ne prorsus peregrina obveniant quae in explicatione sequuntur, sciendum quod apud unumquemvis hominem 
sit internus homo, sit rationalis qui medius, et sit externus; et quod hi inter se distinctissimi sint, de quibus videantur quae prius dicta n. 978. 	                       CAPUT XVI 	1.  ET Sarai uxor 
Abrami non peperit illi; et ei ancilla Aegyptia, et nomen ejus Hagar. 	2.  Et dixit Sarai ad Abram, Ecce quaeso conclusit me JEHOVAH a pariendo, ingredere quaeso ad ancillam meam forte aedificabor 
ab ea et; et auscultavit Abram voci Sarai. 	3.  Et accepit Sarai uxor Abrami Hagarem Aegyptiam ancillam suam, a fine decem annorum ab habitando Abram in terra Canaan, et dedit Abramo viro suo, illi 
in mulierem. 	4. Et ingressus ad Hagarem, et concepit; et vidit quod conceperit, et vilis fuit domina ejus in oculis ejus. 	5. Et dixit Sarai ad Abram, Injuria mea super te, ego dedi ancillam meam 
in sinum tuum, et vidit quod concepit, et vilis sum in oculis ejus, judicet JEHOVAH inter me et inter te. 	6.  Et dixit Abram ad Sarai, Ecce ancilla tua in manu tua, fac ei quod bonum in oculis tuis; 
et humiliavit eam Sarai, et fugit a facie ejus. 	7.  Et invenit eam angelus JEHOVAE ad fontem aquarum in deserto, ad fontem in via Shur. 	8.  Et dixit, Hagar, ancilla Sarai, unde venis?  et quo vadis? 
 et dixit, A facie Sarai dominae meae ego fugio. 	9.  Et dixit ei angelus JEHOVAE, Revertere ad dominam tuam, et humilia te sub manibus illius. 	10.  Et dixit ei angelus JEHOVAE, Multiplicando multiplicabo 
semen tuum, et non numerabitur prae multitudine. 	11.  Et dixit ei angelus JEHOVAE, Ecce tu gravida, et paries filium, et appellabis nomen ejus Ismael, quia audivit JEHOVAH ad afflictionem 
tuam. 	12.  Et is erit onager homo, manus ejus in omnes, et manus omnium in eum, et contra facies omnium fratrum suorum habitabit. 	13.  Et vocavit nomen JEHOVAE loquentis ad se, TU DEUS videns me, 
quia dixit, Num etiam hic vidi post videntem me? 	14.  Propterea vocavit fontem, fons Vivo videnti me; ecce inter Kadesh et inter Bared. 	15.  Et peperit Hagar Abramo filium, et vocavit Abram nomen 
filii sui, quem peperit Hagar, Ismael. 	16.  Et Abram filius octoginta annorum et sex annorum, in pariendo Hagar Ismaelem Abramo. </p>
