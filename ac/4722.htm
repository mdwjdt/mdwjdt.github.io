Verses 18-22. And they saw him afar off, and before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to cause him to die. And they said a man to his brother, Behold this lord of dreams cometh. Come 
now therefore and let us slay him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, An evil wild beast hath devoured him; and we shall see what his dreams will be. And Reuben heard, and rescued him 
out of their hand, and said, Let us not smite him, the soul. And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood; cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him; that he might rescue 
him out of their hand, to bring him back to his father. "And they saw him afar off," signifies perception of the Lord's Divine Human remotely; "and before he came near unto them, they conspired against 
him to cause him to die," signifies that they wished to extinguish the Divine spiritual which is from the Lord's Divine Human; "and they said a man to his brother," signifies their mutual thoughts; 
"behold, this lord of dreams cometh," signifies that those things were empty; "come now therefore and let us slay him," signifies the extinction of the essential of doctrine concerning the Lord's Divine 
Human; "and cast him into one of the pits," signifies among falsities; "and we will say an evil wild beast hath devoured him," signifies a lie from a life of cupidities; "and we shall see what will 
become of his dreams," signifies that the preachings concerning it would thus be false and would appear so; "and Reuben heard," signifies confession of the faith of the church in general; "and rescued 
him out of their hand," signifies liberation; "and said let us not smite him, the soul," signifies that it must not be extinguished, because it is the life of religion; "and Reuben said unto them," 
signifies exhortation; "shed no blood," signifies that they should not do violence to what is holy; "cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness," signifies that they should conceal it meanwhile 
among their falsities; "but lay no hand upon him," signifies that they should not do violence to it; "that he might rescue him out of their hand, to bring him back to his father," signifies that it 
might claim it for the church. </p>

Verses 18-22 And they saw him from a distance; and before he drew near to them they plotted against him, to put him to death. And they said, a man to his brother, Behold, that dreamer<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> is coming. So 
now come, and let us kill him, and let us throw him into one of the pits, and let us say, An evil wild animal has devoured him; and we shall see what his dreams are going to be. And Reuben heard it and 
rescued him out of their hands, and said, Let us not strike him, [as to his] soul.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> And Reuben said to them, Do not shed blood; throw him into this pit in the wilderness and do not lay a hand on him 
- so that he might therefore rescue him out of their hands, to return him to his father. </p>
<p>'They saw him from a distance' means the Lord's Divine Human perceived remotely. 'And before he drew near 
to them they plotted against him, to put him to death' means that they desired to annihilate the Divine Spiritual which proceeded from the Lord's Divine Human. 'And they said, a man to his brother' means 
the thoughts held mutually by them. 'Behold, that dreamer is coming' means those futile ideas. 'So now come, and let us kill him' means an annihilation of the essential teaching regarding the Lord's 
Divine Human. 'And let us throw him into one of the pits' means among falsities. 'And let us say, An evil wild animal has devoured him' means a lie invented out of a life of evil desires. 'And we shall 
see what his dreams are going to be' means that declarations concerning Him were by their reckoning false ones and were seen by them as such. 'And Reuben heard it' means the Church's confession of 
faith in general. 'And rescued him out of their hands' means deliverance. 'And said, Let us not strike him, [as to his] soul' means that it must not be annihilated because it is the life of religion. 
'And Reuben said to them' means an exhortation. 'Do not shed blood' means not to do violence to what is holy. 'Throw him into this pit in the wilderness'' means that for the time being they should conceal 
it among their falsities. 'And do not lay a hand on him' means, and should not do any violence to it. 'So that he might therefore rescue him out of their hands, to return him to his father' means 
so that it might lay claim to it for the Church.

Vers. 18-22.  Et viderunt eum e longinquo, et antequam appropinquavit ad illos, et machinati sunt ei ad mori faciendum eum.  Et dixerunt vir ad fratrem suum, Ecce dominus somniorum iste venit.  Et 
nunc ite, et occidamus eum, et mittamus eum in unam fovearum, et dicamus, Fera mala comedit eum; et videbimus quid erunt somnia ejus.  Et audivit Reuben, et eripuit eum e manu illorum, et dixit, 
Non percutiamus eum, anima.  Et dixit ad illos Reuben, Ne effundatis sanguinem, mittite eum ad foveam illam quae in deserto, et manum ne mittatis in eum; propterea ut eriperet eum e manu illorum, ad 
reducendum eum ad patrem ejus. `Viderunt eum e longinquo' significat perceptionem Divini Humani Domini remote: `et antequam appropinquavit ad illos, et machinati sunt ei ad mori faciendum eum' significat 
quod exstinguere vellent Divinum Spirituale quod ex Divino Humano Domini: `et dixerunt vir ad fratrem suum' significat cogitationes eorum mutatus; `Ecce dominus somniorum iste venit' significat 
quod vana illa: `et nunc ite, et occidamus eum' significat exstinctionem essentialis doctrinae de Divino Humano Domini: `et mittamus eum in unam fovearum' significat inter falsa: `et dicamus, 
Fera mala comedit eum' significat mendacium ex vita cupiditatum: `et videbimus quid erunt somnia ejus' significat quod praedicationes de Ipso sic falsae et viderentur: `et audivit Reuben' significat 
confessionem fidei Ecclesiae in communi: `et eripuit eum e manu illorum' significat liberationem: `et dixit, Non percutiamus eum, anima' significat quod non exstinguendum quia vita religionis: `et 
dixit ad illos Reuben' significat adhortationem:  `Ne effundatis sanguinem' significat ne violent sanctum: `mittite eum ad foveam illam quae in deserto' significat quod absconderent interea inter 
sua falsa: `et manum ne mittatis in eum' significat ne violarent: `propterea ut eriperet eum e manu illorum ad reducendum eum ad patrem ejus' significat ut vindicaret Ecclesiae. </p>
