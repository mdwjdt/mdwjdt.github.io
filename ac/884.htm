<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>884.</strong>“看哪，嘴里衔着一片啄下来的橄榄叶”表些许信之真理：“叶”表真理；“橄榄”表源于仁爱的良善；“啄下来”表信之真理源于仁爱的事实；“嘴里”表它显为可见的事实。这一点从橄榄树的含义清楚可知，也可从这几句话本身明显看出来。只有“些许”从仅有一片叶子的事实清楚看出来。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]884.</strong> And look: the torn-off leaf of an olive tree in its mouth, symbolizes a very small quantity of religious truth. The leaf means truth, an olive tree means the goodness that charity inspires, torn off means that this is the source of religious truth, and in its mouth means that it became visible. This can be seen from the symbolism of an olive tree, and it shines out from the words themselves. The fact that it was only a leaf indicates the meagerness of the amount. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 884</b></p><p><b>884.</b>
And lo in her mouth an olive leaf plucked off. That this signifies some little of the truth of faith; that "leaf" is truth, and "olive" the good of charity; that "plucked off" means the truth of faith 
therefrom, and "in her mouth" that it was shown, is evident from the signification of an olive tree, and is obvious from the very words. And that there was only a little, appears from there being only a leaf. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 884</b></p><p><b>884.</b>
'And behold, in its mouth an olive leaf plucked off' means a small measure of the truth of faith; 'leaf' meaning truth, 'olive' good that stems from charity, 'plucked off' the fact that the truth of 
faith derives from that charity, and 'in its mouth' the fact that it was made visible. This is clear from the meaning of 'olive' and is evident from the very words themselves. That a tiny quantity is 
meant is clear from the fact that it was a leaf and no more. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 884</b>
</p><b>884.</b>
'Et ecce folium olivae decerptum in ore ejus': quod significent aliquantulum veri fidei, quod 'folium' sit verum, 'oliva' sit bonum charitatis, 'decerptum' quod verum fidei inde, 'in ore ejus' quod 
ostensum, constat a significatione 'olivae,' et ex ipsis verbis elucet; et quod pauxillum, ex eo quod solum esset 'folium.' </p>
