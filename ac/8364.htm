<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8364节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8364.</strong>“我就不将所加与埃及人的一切疾病加在你们身上”表他们要被阻离存在于那些陷入分离之信并过着邪恶生活之人中间的邪恶。这从“疾病”和“不加在你身上”的含义，以及“埃及人”的代表清楚可知：“疾病”是指邪恶，如下文所述；“埃及人”是指那些坚持分离之信并过着邪恶生活的人（参看<a href="7097.htm">7097</a>，<a href="7317.htm">7317</a>，<a href="7926.htm">7926</a>，<a href="8148.htm">8148</a>节）；当涉及表示邪恶的“疾病”时，“不加在你身上”是指他们要被阻离邪恶。因为耶和华，也就是主不拿走邪恶，而是使人退离它，把人保持在良善中（<a href="929.htm">929</a>，<a href="1581.htm">1581</a>，<a href="2256.htm">2256</a>，<a href="2406.htm">2406</a>，<a href="4564.htm">4564</a>，<a href="8206.htm">8206</a>节）。正因如此，“不将疾病加在他们身上”表示他们要被阻离邪恶。<br />“疾病”之所以表示疾病，是因为就内义而言，所表示的是攻击属灵生命的那类事物。攻击这生命的疾病是邪恶，被称为恶欲和情欲；信和仁构成属灵生命。当虚假取代信之真理，邪恶取代仁之良善时，这生命就患病了；因为它们导致该生命的死亡，这死亡被称为属灵的死亡，是诅咒，正如疾病导致属世生命的死亡。这就是为何“疾病”在内义上表示邪恶；“埃及人的疾病”则表示那些坚持分离之信并过着邪恶生活的人将自己所投入，并用来侵扰正直人的邪恶；前文论述埃及灾殃的地方论述了这些邪恶。<br />在圣言的其它地方，“疾病”也表示邪恶，如在摩西五经：<br />你要谨守遵行我今日所吩咐你的诫命、律例、典章。耶和华必将一切的疾病从你身上除去，你所知道埃及各样的恶疾，祂不加在你身上，只加在恨你的人身上。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.11.htm">7:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.15.htm">15</a>）<br /><br />你若不听从耶和华你神的话，不谨守遵行祂的一切诫命律例，耶和华必在你手里所办的一切事上，使咒诅、扰乱、责罚临到你，直到你被毁灭，都因你行为之败坏、就是你离弃了我的缘故。耶和华必使瘟疫贴在你身上，直到祂将你从地上灭绝。耶和华要用痨病、热病、火症、高烧、干旱、枯槁、霉烂攻击你，这都要追袭你，直到你灭亡。耶和华必用埃及的疮并痔疮、牛皮癣与疥攻击你，使你不能医治。耶和华必用癫狂、眼瞎、心惊攻击你。你因眼中所看见的，必致疯狂。耶和华必攻击你，使膝上腿上，从脚掌到头顶，长毒疮无法医治。祂必将埃及一切的疾病，以及没有写在这律法书上的各样病症、灾殃降都扔回你身上。耶和华却使你心发颤，眼目憔悴，灵魂忧伤。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申28.15.htm">28:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申28.20.htm">20</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申28.22.htm">22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申28.27.htm">27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申28.28.htm">28</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申28.34.htm">34</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申28.35.htm">35</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申28.60.htm">60</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申28.61.htm">61</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申28.65.htm">65</a>）<br />此处所提到的一切疾病皆表示属灵的疾病，也就是毁灭意愿良善的生命的邪恶和毁灭理解真理的生命的虚假；简言之，就是毁灭信和仁所构成的属灵生命的事物。属世疾病还对应于这类事物，因为人类当中出现的一切疾病都来源于属灵疾病，因为每一种都由于罪而存在（<a href="5712.htm">5712</a>，<a href="5726.htm">5726</a>节）。此外，每种疾病都对应于自己的邪恶；原因在于，构成人生命的一切皆来源于灵界。因此，如果人的属灵生命患病了，邪恶就由此蔓延至他的属世生命，并在那里变成一种疾病。关于疾病与邪恶的对应关系，可参看通过经历所作出的说明（<a href="5711.htm">5711</a>-<a href="5727.htm">5727</a>节）。<br />其它地方的“疾病或病症”也表示这些事物，如摩西五经：<br />你们要敬拜耶和华你们的神，祂必赐福与你的粮与你的水；我必从你们中间除去疾病。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出23.25.htm">23:25</a>）.<br />利未记：<br />如果你们弃绝我的律例，灵魂厌恶我的典章，不遵行我一切的诫命，使我的约失效，我必命定惊惶，叫眼目干瘪、折磨灵魂的痨病、热病临到你们。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.15.htm">26:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.16.htm">16</a>）<br />“痨病”表示真理的减少和虚假的增多；“热病”表示邪恶的欲望。还有以下经文：<br />你们为什么一再背叛呢？满头患病，全心发昏。从脚掌到头顶，没有一处完全的，尽是伤口、疤痕与新打的伤痕，未曾挤净，未曾包扎，也没有用油滋润。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛1.5.htm">1:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛1.6.htm">6</a>）<br />没有人能明白此处“患病”、“伤口”、“疤痕”、“伤痕”表示罪。在以西结书也一样：<br />祸哉！以色列的牧人，瘦弱的羊，你们没有养壮；有病的，你们没有医治；受伤的，你们没有包扎。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结34.2.htm">34:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结34.4.htm">4</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />我的罪孽高过我的头，因我的愚昧，我的伤腐烂殆尽。我满腹烧灼，我的肉无一完全。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗38.4.htm">38:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗38.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗38.7.htm">7</a>）<br />由于“疾病”表示属灵生命的紊乱和邪恶，所以各种的疾病也表示该生命的各种紊乱和邪恶。“瘟疫”表示良善和真理的荒凉或荒谬（参看<a href="7102.htm">7102</a>，<a href="7505.htm">7505</a>节）；“麻风病”表示对真理的亵渎（<a href="6963.htm">6963</a>节）。一般来说，“疾病”表示罪，这也可见于以赛亚书：<br />一个多受痛苦，熟悉病患的人；人因此好像掩面不顾祂；祂被藐视，我们也不尊重祂。祂诚然担当我们的病患，背负我们的痛苦；因祂受的鞭伤，我们得医治。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛53.3.htm">53:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛53.5.htm">5</a>）<br />这论及主。<br />由于疾病代表不义之道和属灵生命的邪恶，所以主所医治的疾病表示从侵扰教会和人类，并导致属灵死亡的各种邪恶和虚假当中得释放。神迹与其它奇迹的区别在于以下事实：它们涉及并关注教会和天国的状态；这就是为何主的神迹主要是医治疾病，这主向施洗约翰打发来的门徒所说的话就表示这一点：<br />你们把所听见、所看见的事告诉约翰：就是瞎子看见，瘸子行走，长大麻疯的洁净，聋子听见，死人复活，穷人有福音听。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太11.4.htm">11:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太11.5.htm">5</a>）<br />这就是为何经上如此频繁地说，主在百姓中间医治各样疾病和病症（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太4.23.htm">4:23</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太9.35.htm">9:35</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太14.14.htm">14:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太14.35.htm">35</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太14.36.htm">36</a>路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路4.40.htm">4:40</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路5.15.htm">5:15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路6.17.htm">6:17</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路7.21.htm">7:21</a>马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可1.32.htm">1:32</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可1.34.htm">34</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/可3.10.htm">3:10</a>）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8364</b></p><p><b>8364.</b>
All the disease that I have put on the Egyptians, I will not put upon thee. That this signifies that they are to be withheld from the evils that pertain to those who are in faith separate and in a life 
of evil, is evident from the signification of "disease," as being evil (of which below); from the representation of the Egyptians, as being those who are in faith separate and in a life of evil (see 
n. 7097, 7317, 7926, 8148); and from the signification of "not to put upon thee," when said of disease, by which evil is signified, as being that they are to be withheld from evil; for Jehovah, that 
is, the Lord, does not take away evil; but withholds man from it, and keeps him in good (n. 929, 1581, 2256, 2406, 4564, 8206). From this it is that by "not to put disease upon them" is signified that 
they are to be withheld from evils. [2] That "disease" denotes evil, is because in the internal sense are signified such things as affect the spiritual life. The diseases which affect this life are 
evils, and are called cupidities and concupiscences. Faith and charity make the spiritual life. This life sickens when falsity takes the place of the truth which is of faith, and evil takes the place 
of the good which is of charity; for these bring this life unto death, which is called spiritual death, and is damnation, as diseases bring the natural life unto its death. Hence it is that by "disease" 
is signified in the internal sense evil; and by "the diseases of the Egyptians," the evils into which those cast themselves who had been in faith separate and in a life of evil, whereby they had infested 
the upright, which evils have been treated of in what precedes, where the plagues in Egypt were treated of. [3] Evils are also meant by "diseases" in other passages in the Word, as in Moses: </p>
<p> 
    If thou wilt keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, Jehovah will remove from thee all sickness, and will not put upon thee all the evil weaknesses 
of Egypt, which thou hast known; but will give them upon thy haters (Deut. 7:11, 15).      If thou wilt not obey the voice of Jehovah thy God, by keeping to do all His commandments and His statutes, 
Jehovah will send on thee the curse, the disquiet, and the rebuke, in every putting forth of thy hand which thou doest, until thou be destroyed, because of the wickedness of thy works, whereby thou 
hast forsaken Me. Jehovah shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until He has consumed thee from upon the land; Jehovah shall smite thee with consumption, and with a hot fever, and with a burning 
fever, and with a raging fever, and with drought, and with blasting, and with jaundice, which shall pursue thee until thou perish: Jehovah shall smite thee with the ulcer of Egypt, and with the hemorrhoids, 
and with the scab, and with the itch, that thou canst not be healed. Jehovah shall smite thee with fury, and with blindness, and with amazement of heart. Thou shalt become mad from the look 
of thine eyes. Jehovah shall smite thee with a sore ulcer, upon the knees, and upon the thighs, whereof thou canst not be healed, from the sole of the foot unto the crown of thy head. He will throw back 
on thee all the weakness of Egypt, also every disease, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law. Jehovah shall give thee a trembling heart, consumption of eyes, and grief of 
soul (Deut. 28:15, 20-22, 27, 28, 34, 35, 60, 61, 65). By all the diseases here named are signified spiritual diseases, which are evils destroying the life of the will of good, and falsities destroying 
the life of the understanding of truth; in a word, destroying the spiritual life which is of faith and charity. Moreover natural diseases correspond to such things, for every disease in the human race 
is from this source, because from sin (n. 5712, 5726). Moreover every disease corresponds to its own evil; the reason is that everything of man's life is from the spiritual world; and therefore if 
his spiritual life sickens, evil is derived therefrom into the natural life also, and becomes a disease there. (See what has been said from experience about the correspondence of diseases with evils, 
n. 5711-5727.) [4] Like things are signified by "diseases" in other passages, as in Moses: </p>
<p>     Ye shall worship Jehovah your God, that He may bless thy bread, and thy waters; and I will take disease 
away from the midst of thee (Exod. 23:25).      If ye shall reject My statutes, and if your soul loathe My judgments, so that ye will not do all My commandments, while ye make My covenant vain, I 
will enjoin terror upon you, with consumption, and with burning fever, that shall consume the eyes, and torment the soul (Lev. 26:15, 16); </p>
<p>signifying the decrease of truth, and the increase of falsity; 
"burning fever" denotes the cupidity of evil. Further in these passages: </p>
<p>     Wherefore will ye add a going back? the whole head is diseased, and the whole heart faint. From the sole of the foot even 
unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wound, and scar, and flesh blow, not pressed out, and not bandaged, and not mollified with oil (Isa. 1:5, 6); </p>
<p>that here by "disease," "wound," "scar," 
and "blow," are meant sins, is hidden from no one.      Woe to the shepherds of Israel, the feeble sheep have ye not strengthened, the sick one have ye not healed, and the broken one have ye not bandaged 
(Ezek. 34:2, 4).      Mine iniquities are gone over my head, my wounds have putrefied, they have consumed away, because of my foolishness, for my bowels are filled with burning, and there is 
no soundness in my flesh (Ps. 38:4, 5, 7). [5] As by "diseases" are signified the corruptions and evils of spiritual life, therefore by the various kinds of diseases are signified also the various kinds 
of corruptions and evils of that life. (That by "pestilence" is signified the vastation of good and truth, see n. 7102, 7505; and by "leprosy," the profanation of truth, n. 6963.) That in general 
by "diseases" are signified sins, can also be seen in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     A man of sorrows, and known of disease; whence is as it were a hiding of faces from Him. He was despised, and we esteemed Him not: nevertheless 
He hath borne our diseases, and hath carried our griefs, and through His wounds health hath been given us (53:3-5); </p>
<p>speaking of the Lord. [6] As diseases represented the hurtful and evil 
things of the spiritual life, therefore by the diseases which the Lord healed is signified liberation from various kinds of evil and falsity which infested the church and the human race, and which would 
have led to spiritual death. For Divine miracles are distinguished from other miracles by the fact that they involve and have regard to states of the church and of the heavenly kingdom. Therefore 
the Lord's miracles consisted chiefly in the healing of diseases. This is meant by the Lord's words to the disciples sent by John: </p>
<p>     Tell John the things which ye hear and see: the blind see, and 
the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead rise again, and the poor hear the gospel (Matt. 11:4, 5). Hence it is that it is so often said that the Lord "healed all disease and 
weakness" (Matt. 4:23; 9:35; 14:14, 35, 36; Luke 4:40; 5:15; 6:17; 7:21; Mark 1:32-34; 3:10). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8364</b></p><p><b>8364.</b>
'I will not put on you any sickness that I put on the Egyptians' means that they are to be withheld from the evils present among those who uphold separated faith and lead a life of evil. This is clear 
from the meaning of 'sickness' as evil, dealt with below; from the representation of 'the Egyptians' as those who uphold separated faith and lead a life of evil, dealt with in <a href="7097.htm">7097</a>, <a href="7317.htm">7317</a>, <a href="7926.htm">7926</a>, <a href="8148.htm">8148</a>; 
and from the meaning of 'not putting on you' - when used in association with 'sickness', which means evil - as withholding from evil. For Jehovah, that is, the Lord, does not take away evil but withholds 
a person from it and maintains him in good, <a href="929.htm">929</a>, <a href="1581.htm">1581</a>, <a href="2256.htm">2256</a>, <a href="2406.htm">2406</a>, <a href="4564.htm">4564</a>, <a href="8206.htm">8206</a>. So it is that 'not putting a sickness on them' means that they are to be withheld from evils. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why 
'sickness' means evil is that in the internal sense the kinds of things that attack spiritual life are meant. The sicknesses which attack it are evils, and they are called evil desires and cravings; 
and the components of spiritual life are faith and charity. That life is sick when falsity exists instead of the truth of faith and evil instead of the good of charity, because they lead to the death 
of that life, which is called spiritual death and is damnation, just as sicknesses lead to the death of natural life. This is why in the internal sense 'sickness' means evil, and 'the sicknesses of the 
Egyptians' means the evils which those upholding separated faith and leading a life of evil cast themselves into, and which they used to molest the upright. Those evils have been dealt with in what 
has gone before, where the plagues in Egypt were the subject. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Evils are again meant by 'sicknesses' elsewhere in the Word, as in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
If you keep the commandments and the statutes and the 
judgements which I am commanding you today, Jehovah will take away all sickness from you, and will not put on you any of the evil diseases of Egypt which you have known, but will lay them on [all] who 
hate you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%207:11,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 7:11, 15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>

and rebuke in all that you set your hand to do,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> until you are destroyed, because of the wickedness of your deeds by which you have forsaken Me. Jehovah will make the pestilence cling to you, until 
He has consumed you from upon the land. Jehovah will strike you with consumption, and hot fever, and burning fever, and raging fever, and drought, and blight, and mildew, which will pursue you until 
you perish. Jehovah will strike you with the sores of Egypt, and with hemorrhoids, and the scab, and the itch, so that you cannot be healed. Jehovah will strike you with madness, and blindness, and

</blockquote>
<p>All the sicknesses mentioned here mean spiritual sicknesses, which are evils destructive of the life of 
a will desiring what is good and falsities destructive of the life of an understanding seeing what is true, in short things destructive of spiritual life composed of faith and charity. Natural sicknesses 
also correspond to such things, for every sickness present among the human race has its origin in spiritual ones, because each exists as a result of sin, <a href="5712.htm">5712</a>, <a href="5726.htm">5726</a>. Each sickness furthermore corresponds 
to its own evil. The explanation for this is that everything composing a person's life originates in the spiritual world. If therefore his spiritual life is sick, evil spreads from it into his 
natural life and becomes a sickness there. See what has been stated from experience in <a href="5711.htm">5711</a>-<a href="5727.htm">5727</a> about the correspondence of sicknesses with evils. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The same things are meant by 'sicknesses' elsewhere, 
as in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
You shall worship Jehovah your God, in order that He may bless your bread and your water; and I will take sickness out of your midst. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2023:25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 23:25</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
If 
you despise My statutes, and if your soul abhors My judgements, so that you do not do all My commandments, while you make void My covenant, I will appoint terror over you, along with consumption, and 
burning fever, which will consume the eyes and torment the soul. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2026:15,%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 26:15, 16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Consumption' stands for the decrease of truth and the increase of falsity, 'burning fever' for the desire for evil. 
Further still, in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Why will you also defect?<A name="fntext5"></a><A href="#fn5"><sup>e</sup></a> The whole head [departs] into sickness, and the whole heart is diseased. From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness 
in it, but wounds, and scars, and recent blows. They are not pressed out, nor bound up, nor softened with oil. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%201:5,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 1:5, 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here nobody can fail to see that 'sickness', 'wounds', 'scars', and 'blows' 
are used to mean sins. Similarly in Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Woe to the shepherds of Israel! The weak sheep you have not strengthened, the sick you have not healed, and the broken you have not bound up. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2034:2,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 34:2, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In David, </p>
<blockquote>
My iniquities have gone over my head. My wounds have become putrid, they have rotted away because of my foolishness. For my intestines are full of burning, and there is no soundness 
in my flesh. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2038:4-7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 38:4-7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Since the disorders and evils of spiritual life are meant by 'sicknesses', the various kinds of disorders and evils of that life are meant by the various kinds of 
sicknesses. 'Pestilence' means the vastation or laying waste of goodness and truth, see <a href="7102.htm">7102</a>, <a href="7505.htm">7505</a>; and 'leprosy' means the profanation of truth, <a href="6963.htm">6963</a>. In general 'sicknesses' means sins, as may also 
be seen in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
... a man of sorrows, and acquainted with sickness, on account of which as it were men hid their faces from Him. He was despised, so that we did not esteem Him. Nevertheless He 
has borne our sicknesses and carried our sorrows, and through His wounds healing has been given to us. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2053:3-5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 53:3-5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 Since sicknesses represented the unrighteous ways 
and the evils of spiritual life the sicknesses which the Lord healed have as their meaning deliverance from the different kinds of evil and falsity that were molesting the Church and human race and that 
would have brought spiritual death. Divine miracles are distinguishable from other miracles by the fact that they involve and have regard to states of the Church and the heavenly kingdom; and this 
is why the Lord's miracles were primarily healing of sicknesses. These miracles are meant by the Lord's words addressed to the disciples sent by John, </p>
<blockquote>
Tell John the things which you hear and see: 
the blind see and the lame walk; lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear; the dead rise again and the poor hear the gospel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2011:4,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 11:4, 5</a>.

<blockquote>
This is why it says so many times that the Lord healed every 
sickness and every disease among the people, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%204:23;%209:35;%2014:14,%2035,%2036&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 4:23; 9:35; 14:14, 35, 36</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%204:40;%205:15;%206:17;%207:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 4:40; 5:15; 6:17; 7:21</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%201:32-34;%203:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 1:32-34; 3:10</a>.

</p><b>8364.</b>
`Omnem morbum quem posui in Aegyptios, non ponam super te': quod significet quod detinendi a malis quae illis qui in fide separata et in vita mali, constat ex significatione `morbi' quod sit malum, 
de qua sequitur; ex repraesentatione `Aegyptiorum' quod sint qui in fide separata et in vita mali, de qua n. 7097, 7317, 7926, 8148; et ex significatione `non ponere super te,' cum dicitur de `morbo,' 
per quem significatur malum, quod sit quod detinendi a malo, nam Jehovah, hoc est, Dominus, non aufert malum sed detinet hominem ab illo et tenet in bono, n. 929, 1581, 2256, 2406, 4564, 8206; inde est 
quod per `non ponere morbum super illos' significetur quod detinendi a malis. 	2 Quod `morbus' sit malum, est quia in sensu interno {1}significantur talia quae afficiunt vitam spiritualem; morbi qui 
illam afficiunt sunt mala, et vocantur cupiditates et concupiscentiae; vitam spiritualem facit fides et charitas; illa vita aegrotat cum falsum est loco veri quod fidei, et malum loco boni quod charitatis; 
haec enim (x)perducunt illam vitam ad mortem quae vocatur mors spiritualis, {2}et est damnatio, sicut morbi perducunt vitam naturalem ad suam mortem; inde est quod per `morbum' in sensu interno 
significetur malum, et per `morbos Aegyptiorum' mala in quae illi qui in fide separata et in vita mali se conjecerunt, per quod infestaverint probos; quae mala in praecedentibus ubi de plagis in Aegypto 
actum est. 	3 Mala {3} intelliguntur per morbos etiam alibi in Verbo, ut apud Moschen, Si {4}custodiveris praecepta et statuta et judicia quae Ego praecipiens tibi hodie, removebit Jehovah a te 
omnem morbum, et omnes languores Aegypti malos, quos nosti; non ponet super te, sed dabit eos super osores tuos, Deut. vii 11, 15: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Si non oboediveris voci Jehovae Dei tui, custodiendo 
ad faciendum omnia praecepta Ipsius et statuta Ipsius, mittet Jehovah in te maledictionem, conturbationem, et increpationem, in omni missione manus tuae quam facies, usque dum perdaris; propter malitiam 
operum tuorum, quibus deseruisti Me; adhaerere faciet Jehovah tibi pestem, donec consumpserit te desuper terra; percutiet te Jehovah tabe, et febri calida, et febri ardente, et febri aestuante, et 
siccitate, et uredine, et aurigine, quae persequentur te, usque dum pereas: percutiet te Jehovah ulcere Aegypti, et {5}haemorrhoidis, et scabie, et prurigine, ut non possis sanari: percutiet te Jehovah 
furore, et caecitate, et stupore cordis: fies insanus ab aspectu oculorum tuorum: percutiet te Jehovah ulcere malo, super genubus, et super femoribus, a quibus non possis sanari, a vola pedis tui usque 
ad verticem tuum: rejiciet in te omnem languorem Aegypti, etiam omnem morbum et omnem plagam, quae non scripta in libro Legis hujus: dabit tibi Jehovah cor trepidans, consumptionem oculorum, et dolorem 
animae, Deut. xxviii 15, 20-22, 27, 28, 34, 35, 60, 61, 65; </p>
<p>per omnes morbos hic nominatos significantur morbi spirituales, (x)qui sunt mala destruentia vitam voluntatis boni et falsa destruentia 
vitam intellectus veri, verbo, destruentia vitam spiritualem quae est fidei et charitatis; morbi naturales etiam talibus correspondent, nam omnis morbus in genere humano est inde, quia ex peccato, 
n. 5712, 5726; unusquisque etiam morbus correspondet suo malo; causa est quia omne vitae hominis est ex spirituali mundo; quare si vita ejus spiritualis aegrotat, etiam derivatur inde malum in vitam 
naturalem, {6}quod ibi fit morbus; videantur quae de correspondentia morborum cum malis ab experientia, n. 5711-5727. 	4 Similia per `morbos' {7} significantur alibi, ut apud Moschen, Coletis Jehovam 
Deum vestrum, ut benedicat pani tuo et aquis tuis, et amoveam morbum e medio tui, Exod. xxiii 25: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Si statuta Mea reprobaveritis, sique judicia Mea fastidiverit anima vestra, ut non faciatis 
omnia praecepta Mea, dum irritum feceritis foedus Meum, mandabo super vobis terrori, cum tabe et cum ardente febri, quae consumptura oculos et cruciatura animam, Lev. xxvi 15, 16; </p>
<p>{8}`tabes' pro 
{9}decrescentia veri et {10}increscentia falsi; `ardens febris' pro cupiditate mali: porro apud Esaiam, Quare addetis recessionem? totum caput in morbum, et totum cor languidum; a vola pedis usque 
ad caput non in eo integritas, vulnus, et cicatrix, et plaga recens; non expressa, et non obligata, et non emollita (x)oleo, i [5,] 6; </p>
<p>quod hic per `morbum, vulnus, cicatricem, et plagam' intelligantur 
peccata, {11}neminem latet': similiter apud Ezechielem, Vae pastoribus Israelis! oves infirmas non confirmastis, (x)aegrotam non sanastis et fractam non obligastis, xxxiv [2,] 4: </p>
<p>apud Davidem, Iniquitates 
meae transiverunt caput meum, computruerunt, contabuerunt vulnera mea, propter stultitiam meam, nam intestina mea repleta sunt ardore, nec integritas in carne mea, Ps. xxxviii 5-7, [8] [A.V. 
4-7]. 	5 Quia per `morbos' significantur vitia et mala vitae spiritualis, idcirco per morborum varia genera significantur etiam varia genera vitiorum et malorum illius vitae; quod per `pestem' significetur 
vastatio boni et veri, videatur n. 7102, 7505; et quod per `lepram' profanatio veri, n. 6963.  Quod in genere per `morbos' significentur peccata, constare etiam potest apud Esaiam, Vir dolorum, 
et notus morbi; unde quasi occultatio facierum ab Ipso; contemptus ut non reputaverimus Ipsum; verumtamen morbos nostros Ille tulit, et dolores nostros portavit, et per vulnera Ipsius sanitas data 
nobis, liii 3-5; </p>
<p>ubi de Domino. 	6 Quia `morbi' repraesentabant iniqua et mala vitae spiritualis, idcirco per morbos quos Dominus sanavit (x)significatur liberatio a {12} variis generibus mali et 
falsi quae Ecclesiam et humanum genus infestabant, et quae mortem spiritualem {13}inductura essent; miracula enim Divina a miraculis aliis distinguuntur per id quod illa involvant et spectent status Ecclesiae 
et regni caelestis; propterea miracula Domini imprimis fuerunt sanationes morborum; haec intelliguntur per Domini verba ad discipulos a Johanne missos, Annuntiate Johanni quae auditis et videtis; 
caeci vident et claudi ambulant, leprosi mundantur et surdi audiunt, mortui resurgunt et pauperes audiunt evangelium, Matth. xi 4, 5; </p>
<p>inde est quod toties dicatur quod Dominus `omnem morbum et 
languorem populi sanaverit,' {14} Matth. iv 23, ix 35, xiv 14, 35, 36; Luc. iv 40, v 15, vi 17, vii 21; Marc. i 32-34, iii 10. 	@1 intelliguntur$ 	@2 estque$ 	@3 i quoque$ 	@4 custodias$ 	@5 haemorrhoidibus
