<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3862节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3862.</strong>前面已经说明（<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>节），“十二支派”表示真理与良善，或信与爱的全部事物。现在逐一论述各支派以之为名的雅各的儿子们，故此处又有一个奥秘要揭开，即每个儿子所具有的含义。在天堂，一切属天和属灵之热，或爱与仁，在外在形式上被感觉为太阳的火焰；而一切属天和属灵之光，或信在外在形式上则被看为太阳之光。而且，这属天和属灵之热含有智慧在里面，由此而来的光含有聪明在里面，这是因为它们从主流出，而主是天堂的太阳（<a href="1053.htm">1053</a>，<a href="1521.htm">1521</a>-<a href="1533.htm">1533</a>，<a href="1619.htm">1619</a>-<a href="1632.htm">1632</a>，<a href="2441.htm">2441</a>，<a href="2495.htm">2495</a>，<a href="2776.htm">2776</a>，<a href="3138.htm">3138</a>，<a href="3167.htm">3167</a>，<a href="3190.htm">3190</a>，<a href="3195.htm">3195</a>，<a href="3222.htm">3222</a>-<a href="3223.htm">3223</a>，<a href="3338.htm">3338</a>-<a href="3339.htm">3339</a>，<a href="3341.htm">3341</a>，<a href="3413.htm">3413</a>，<a href="3485.htm">3485</a>，<a href="3636.htm">3636</a>，<a href="3643.htm">3643</a>节）。由此明显可知，一切良善皆来自从显为太阳的主那里所流出的热，一切真理皆来自由此而来的光。由此还明显可知，爱或良善所具有的一切情感就是从主所流出的属天和属灵之热的变化，这就是状态变化的来源；还有，真理或信所具有的一切思维就是从主所流出的属天和属灵之光的变化，这就是聪明的来源。天上的所有天使都沐浴在这热和光中，他们的情感和思维没有其它源头，也不是别的什么东西。这一点从天使所使用的不同交流形式明显看出来，由于这些交流形式源于天堂的热和光，所以它们由含有天堂之热的天堂之光的变化或改动构成，因此无法描述，并且如此多样化和完全，以至于远远超出人的理解（<a href="3342.htm">3342</a>，<a href="3344.htm">3344</a>，<a href="3345.htm">3345</a>节）。<br />为了让这些事物能以代表的形式在世上呈现出来，给雅各的每个儿子所取的名字就表示良善与真理，或爱与信的普遍划分；因而表示属天和属灵之热的变化，以及由此而来的光之变化的显现。这些普遍显现的实际次序就确定了火焰的强度和它所衍生的辉煌。当这次序从爱开始时，在纯正次序中随爱而来的一切事物就显为火焰；但当这次序从信开始时，在纯正次序中随之而来的一切事物就充满光，不过，一切不同取决于随之而来的事物。然而，如果它们不是照着纯正次序随之而来，那么一切事物都是模糊的，并且模糊的方式千差万别。蒙主的神圣怜悯，这种次序和由此导致的不同以后予以讨论。这解释了主如何通过乌陵和土明给出回答，以及他们如何根据所讨论的真实事物的状态凭借光及其通过刻有十二支派名字的透明宝石的闪烁接受答复。因为如前所述，主国度中爱与信的普遍划分，因而在天堂代表爱与信划分的火焰和光的普遍显现就铭刻在这些名字上。<br />因此，首先可从圣言证实，所提及支派名字的次序在圣言中是有变化的，其次序的每次变化都取决于所论述主题的状态。由此可知，主藉着乌陵和土明所给出的回答就是光照着正讨论的事物的状态因着次序的闪烁。因为天堂的一切光都照着该事物所经历的不同状态而发生变化，这些状态又照着良善与真理的次序而发生变化。至于每个名字表示真理或良善的哪个方面，这从正在给出的解释明显可知。也就是说，“流便”表示从主而来的信；“西缅”表示从主所接受的意愿之信；“利未”表示属灵之爱，也就是仁爱；“犹大”表示爱的神性和主的属天国度。其他八个儿子的含义将在下一章予以阐述。此处描述的是他们出生的次序，该次序如下：流便、西缅、利未、犹大、但、拿弗他利、迦得、亚设、以萨迦、西布伦、约瑟、便雅悯（参看<a href="http://39-27.cn/创29.32.htm">29:32</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创29.35.htm">35</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/创30.6.htm">30:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创30.8.htm">8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创30.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创30.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创30.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创30.20.htm">20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创30.24.htm">24</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/创35.18.htm">35:18</a>）。这个次序是由此处所论述的主题，就是人之重生的状态决定的，因为重生始于“流便”所表示的信之真理，由此向“西缅”所表示的对真理的意愿发展，由此向“利未”所表示的仁爱发展，如此向主发展，就至高意义而言，主由“犹大”来代表。属灵的怀孕和生产，或重生从外在之物行进到内在之物，如前所述（<a href="3860.htm">3860</a>节）；也就是从信之真理行进到爱之良善。<br />在雅各来到幔利（基列亚巴）他父亲以撒那里之前，这十二个儿子以下列次序命名：流便、西缅、利未、犹大、以萨迦、西布伦、约瑟、便雅悯、但、拿弗他利、迦得、亚设（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创35.23.htm">35:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创35.26.htm">26</a>）。在这种情况下，先提及的名字是利亚和拉结所生的儿子，后提及的是婢女所生的儿子，这是由那里所论述主题的状态决定的。当起行下埃及时（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创46.9.htm">46:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创46.19.htm">19</a>）；他们按另一种次序被列举出来；当雅各，那时叫以色列，在死前祝福他们（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.3.htm">49:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.27.htm">27</a>）时，又是一种次序；当摩西祝福他们（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.6.htm">33:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.24.htm">24</a>）时，同样是另外一种次序。当他们在会幕四围安营时，他们是按着以下次序：在东边，是犹大、以萨迦、西布伦；在南边，是流便、西缅、迦得；在西边，是以法莲、玛拿西、便雅悯；在北边，是但、亚设、拿弗他利（民数记2章）。至于他们站在基利心山上为百姓祝福，以及站在以巴路山宣布咒诅时的次序，这可见于申命记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/申27.12.htm">27:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申27.13.htm">13</a>）。当从各支派所选的首领被打发窥探那地时，他们按以下次序被列出：流便、西缅、犹大、以萨迦、以法莲、便雅悯、西布伦、约瑟或玛拿西、但、亚设、拿弗他利、迦得（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民13.4.htm">13:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民13.16.htm">16</a>）。但要分地为业的首领则按另一种次序被列出（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民34.19.htm">34:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民34.29.htm">29</a>）。至于拈阄分地为业所循的次序，这可见于约书亚记（13-19章）。<br />当以西结书描述各支派所要承受的新地或圣地的地界时，他们按以下次序被提及：但，亚设，拿弗他利，玛拿西，以法莲，流便，犹大，便雅悯，西缅，以萨迦，西布伦，迦得。所有地界都是按着从东头到西头或海来描述的，迦得除外，他在朝南的南头（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结48.1.htm">48:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结48.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结48.23.htm">23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结48.26.htm">26</a>）。当论述新城或圣城时，他们按以下次序被提及：北面有流便、犹大、利未这三门；东面有约瑟、便雅悯、但这三门；南面有西缅、以萨迦、西布伦这三门；西面有迦得、亚设、拿弗他利这三门（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结48.31.htm">48:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结48.34.htm">34</a>）。<br />那些受印的人，就是各支派中的一万二千的次序可见于启示录（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启7.5.htm">7:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启7.8.htm">8</a>）。在所有这些经文中，各支派完全按着所论述主题的状态来列举，次序就与这种状态相对应。这种状态从前后文可以看出来。<br />圣言提到并描述了乌陵和土明中宝石的次序，但没有提及每种宝石对应哪个支派。因为这些宝石代表天上火焰所放射的光的全部事物，也就是源于良善的真理的全部事物，或源于仁的信的全部事物。由于它们代表这些事物，故天上的光本身照着一问一答所论述主题的状态以奇迹般的方式通过它们闪耀。闪烁的亮光代表关于良善与真理的肯定回答，这光伴随着宝石色彩照着良善与真理状态的不同而发生的变化。就像天堂里的情形，在那里，一切属天和属灵之物都通过光及其不同来表达，并且以世人无法形容、完全不能理解的方式来表达。因为如前反复说明的，天上的光含有来自主的生命，因而含有智慧和聪明。所以，光的不同就包含构成生命的一切事物，也就是构成智慧和聪明的一切事物，而火焰及其闪烁和辉煌的不同则包含构成良善的生命和来自这良善的真理之生命，也就是对主之爱和源于这爱之信的一切事物。这就是放在亚伦以弗得的胸牌和心上的乌陵和土明。它们的性质从以下事实明显看出来：“乌陵和土明”这两个词表示光和觉知，他们所戴的胸牌被称为“决断胸牌”，因为“决断”就是聪明和智慧（<a href="2235.htm">2235</a>节）。它还放在亚伦的心上，这是因为“心”表示神性之爱（参看<a href="3635.htm">3635</a>节和本章末尾）。因此，这些宝石镶在金槽中，因为“金”在内义上表示爱之良善（<a href="113.htm">113</a>，<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="1552.htm">1552</a>节），“宝石”表示从良善闪耀出来的真理（<a href="114.htm">114</a>节）。<br />关于乌陵和土明，我们在摩西五经中读到：<br />你要用巧工做一个决断的胸牌。要和以弗得一样的作法，用金线和蓝色、紫色、朱红色线，并捻的细麻作成。这胸牌要四方的、叠为两层，要在上面镶宝石，宝石有四行；它们都要镶在金槽中。这些宝石都要按着以色列儿子的名字，十二块都要按着他们的名字；<br />你要用巧工做一个决断的胸牌。要和以弗得一样的作法，用金线和蓝色、紫色、朱红色线，并捻的细麻作成。这胸牌要四方的、叠为两层，要在上面镶宝石，宝石有四行；它们都要镶在金槽中。这些宝石都要按着以色列儿子的名字，十二块都要按着他们的名字；如同刻印章，每一颗有自己的名字，代表十二个支派。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.15.htm">28:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.17.htm">17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.21.htm">21</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出39.8.htm">39:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出39.14.htm">14</a>）<br />这些章节还具体指明每行要镶上哪些宝石。还有：<br />胸牌不可从以弗得上脱下来；亚伦进圣所的时候，要将决断胸牌上以色列儿子们的名字，放在心上，在耶和华面前常作纪念。又要将乌陵和土明放在决断的胸牌里；亚伦进到耶和华面前的时候，它们要放在他的心上；亚伦在耶和华面前常将以色列人的决断牌放在他心上。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.28.htm">28:28</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.30.htm">30</a>；利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利8.7.htm">8:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利8.8.htm">8</a>）<br />耶和华或主通过乌陵被求问并给出回答，这一事实可见于摩西五经：<br />耶和华对摩西说，你要选取嫩的儿子约书亚，又将你的尊荣给他，使以色列全会众都听从他。他要站在祭司以利亚撒面前，以利亚撒要凭乌陵的判断，在耶和华面前为他求问。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民27.18.htm">27:18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民27.20.htm">20</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民27.21.htm">21</a>）<br />撒母耳记：<br />扫罗求问耶和华，耶和华却不借梦，或乌陵，或先知回答他。（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上28.6.htm">28:6</a>）</p>

It has been shown above (n. 3858) that the "twelve tribes" signified all things of truth and good, or of faith and love; and as the sons of Jacob from whom the tribes were named are now treated of one 
by one, therefore another arcanum is here to be opened, namely, what is involved in them. That all celestial and spiritual heat, or love and charity, is perceived in external form in heaven as a flaming 
from the sun; and that all celestial and spiritual light, or faith, in the external form in heaven appears as light from the sun; also, that this celestial and spiritual heat has within it wisdom; 
and that the light therefrom has within it intelligence, and this because they are from the Lord, who is there the sun, may be seen above (n. 1053, 1521-1533, 1619-1632, 2441, 2495, 2776, 3138, 3167, 
3190, 3195, 3222-3223, 3338-3339, 3341, 3413, 3485, 3636, 3643). From this it is evident that all good is from the heat which is from the Lord as a sun; and that all truth is from the light therefrom; 
and it is further evident that all affections, which are of love or good, are variations of that celestial and spiritual heat which is from the Lord, and that thence come the changes of state; and 
that all thoughts, which are of faith or truth, are variegations of that celestial and spiritual light which is from the Lord, and that thence comes intelligence. In this heat and light are all the angels 
in heaven, and their affections and thoughts are from no other source, and are nothing else. This is manifest from their speech, which in consequence of this origin consists of variegations or modifications 
of heavenly light, within which there is heavenly heat, and is therefore also unutterable, and so various and full as to be beyond comprehension (n. 3342, 3344, 3345).  [2] In order that 
these things might be exhibited representatively in the world, such names were given to the several sons of Jacob as would signify the universals of good and truth, or of love and faith, thus universals 
in respect to the variations of celestial and spiritual heat, and as to the variegations of the derivative light. The very order of these universals is that which determines the flame and its derivative 
resplendence. When the order begins from love, everything which follows thence in genuine order appears flaming; but when the order begins from faith, everything which follows in genuine order appears 
lucid; but with every difference according to the things which follow. But if the order in which they follow is not genuine, everything appears obscure, with every difference. Concerning this order 
and the difference thence resulting, of the Lord's Divine mercy something shall be said hereafter. This explains how it was that the Lord gave answers by the Urim and Thummim, and that according 
to the state of the matter in question they received answers by means of lights and their radiance from the precious and pellucid stones, on which were inscribed the names of the twelve tribes; for as 
before said, on the names were inscribed the universals of love and faith in the Lord's kingdom, consequently the universals of flame and light whereby the things of love and faith are represented in 
heaven. [3] It may therefore be first confirmed from the Word that the order in which the names of the tribes are mentioned is various in the Word, and this in accordance with the state of the subject 
treated of; and that from this it may be known that the answers from the Lord given by the Urim and Thummim were shinings forth of light according to the state of the matter in question from order; 
for all the light of heaven varies according to the states of the subject; and the states of the subject vary according to the order of good and truth. But what of truth and good is signified by each 
son of Jacob, will be seen from the explication; namely, that by "Reuben" is signified faith from the Lord; by "Simeon" faith of the will which is from the Lord; by "Levi" spiritual love or charity; 
by "Judah" the Divine of love and the Lord's celestial kingdom. What is signified by the eight remaining sons, will be stated in the following chapter. Their order according to birth is what is here described, 
which is as follows: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, Benjamin (see verses 32-35 of this chapter, and verses 6, 8, 11, 13, 18, 20, 24 of chapter 
30, and verse 18 of chapter 35). This order is according to the state of the subject here treated of, which is the regeneration of man; for in this case the commencement is from the truth of faith, 
which is "Reuben;" and progression is thence made to willing what is true, which is "Simeon;" and thence to charity, which is "Levi;" thus to the Lord, who in the supreme sense is represented by Judah. 
That spiritual conception and birth, or regeneration, proceeds from what is external to what is internal, was stated above (n. 3860); that is, from the truth of faith to the good of love. [4] Previous 
to Jacob's coming to his father Isaac, in Mamre (Kiriath-arba), the twelve sons are named in the following order: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, Benjamin, Dan, Naphtali, 
Gad, Asher (Gen. 35:23-26); in which enumeration the sons born of Leah and Rachel are named first, and last those born of the handmaids, and this according to the state of the subject there treated of. 
They are enumerated in a still different order when they journeyed and came to Egypt (Gen. 46:9-19); and in another order when they were blessed by Jacob, at that time Israel, before his death (Gen. 
49:3-27); and in another when they were blessed by Moses (Deut. 33:6-24). They were in the following order when they encamped around the tent of assembly: to the east, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun; to the 
south, Reuben, Simeon, Gad; to the west, Ephraim, Manasseh, Benjamin; to the north, Dan, Asher, Naphtali (Num. 2). In what order they stood for blessing the people on Mount Gerizim and for cursing 
on Mount Ebal, may be seen in Deut. 27:12-13. When the princes chosen from each tribe were sent to explore the land, they are enumerated in this order: Reuben, Simeon, Judah, Issachar, Ephraim, Benjamin, 
Zebulun, Joseph or Manasseh, Dan, Asher, Naphtali, Gad (Num. 13:4-16). But the princes who were to give the land for inheritance are enumerated in another order (Num. 34:19-29). In what order the 
lot was cast and came forth when the land was given for inheritance, may be seen in Joshua 13 to 19. [5] When in Ezekiel the boundaries of the new or holy land which the tribes were to inherit are described, 
they are mentioned in this order: Dan, Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh, Ephraim, Reuben, Judah, Benjamin, Simeon, Issachar, Zebulun, Gad, all from the corner eastward to the corner of the sea or west, 
except Gad, who was at the corner of the south, toward the south (48:2-8, 23-26); and when treating of the gates of the new or holy city, they are mentioned in this order: toward the north three gates, 
of Reuben, Judah, and Levi; toward the east three gates, of Joseph, Benjamin, and Dan; toward the south three gates, of Simeon, Issachar, and Zebulun; toward the west three gates, of Gad, Asher, 
and Naphtali (Ezek. 48:31-34). The order of those who were sealed, twelve thousand out of every tribe, may be seen in Rev. 7:5-8. In all these passages the enumeration of the tribes is altogether according 
to the state of the specific subject that is being treated of, to which the order corresponds; this state being seen from the things that precede and that follow.  [6] What was the order of the 
precious stones in the Urim and Thummim is mentioned and described in the Word, but to what tribe each stone corresponded is not mentioned, for the stones represented all things of light from celestial 
flame, that is, all things of truth from good, or all things of faith from love; and because they had this representation, heavenly light itself shone through in a miraculous manner in accordance 
with the state of the subject concerning which there was question and answer, being glowing and shining for an affirmative of what was good and true, together with variegations of colors according to 
the differences of the state of that which was good and true; just as takes place in heaven, where all celestial and spiritual things are expressed by means of lights and their differences, and this in 
a manner ineffable and altogether incomprehensible by man; for as before shown within heavenly light there is life from the Lord, consequently wisdom and intelligence, and therefore in the differences 
of the light there is everything that belongs to the life of truth, that is, everything that belongs to wisdom and intelligence; and in the differences of the flame and of its glowing and resplendence, 
there is everything that belongs to the life of good and to the life of truth from good, or to love to the Lord and the derivative faith.  Such were the Urim and Thummim that were on the breastplate 
of the ephod and on the heart of Aaron, as is also evident from the fact that the words "Urim and Thummim" mean "Lights and Perfections," and that the breastplate, on which they were placed, was 
called the "breastplate of judgment," because "judgment" is intelligence and wisdom (n. 2235). The reason why this was on Aaron's heart, was that by the "heart" is signified the Divine love (see above, 
n. 3635, and at the end of this chapter). Hence those precious stones were in settings of gold, for in the internal sense "gold" is the good of love (n. 113, 1551, 1552); and "precious stone," the truth 
that is transparent from good (n. 114). [7] Concerning the Urim and Thummim we read in Moses: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt make a breastplate of judgment, a work of designing, like the work of the ephod thou 
shalt make it, of gold, of blue, and of crimson, and of scarlet double-dyed, and of fine twined linen, shalt thou make it. Foursquare it shall be doubled, and thou shalt set in it settings of stone, 
four rows of stone shall there be; sockets of gold shall there be in their settings. And the stones shall be according to the names of the sons of Israel, twelve according to their names; the engravings 
of a signet, everyone according to his name, they shall be for the twelve tribes (Exod. 28:15-17, 20; 39:8-14).      The stones that were to be in each row are also there designated. And further: </p>
<p> 
    The breastplate shall not depart from off the ephod; and Aaron shall bear the names of the sons of Israel in the breastplate upon his heart, when he goeth in unto the holy place, for a memorial 
before Jehovah continually. And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron's heart when he goeth in before Jehovah; and Aaron shall bear the 
judgment of the sons of Israel upon his heart before Jehovah continually (Exod. 28:28-30; Lev. 8:7-8). That Jehovah or the Lord was inquired of and gave answers by means of the Urim, may be seen in Moses: </p>
<p> 
    Jehovah said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, and thou shalt put of thy glory upon him, that all the congregation of the sons of Israel may obey. He shall stand before Eleazar 
the priest, and he shall inquire for him in the judgment of the Urim before Jehovah (Num. 27:18, 20-21). And in Samuel: </p>
<p>     Saul inquired of Jehovah, and Jehovah answered him not, neither by dreams, 
nor by Urim, nor by prophets (1 Sam. 28:6). </p>

In <a href="3858.htm">3858</a> above it was shown that 'the twelve tribes' meant all things forming part of truth and good, or of faith and love. In this present paragraph, now that the sons of Jacob individually after whom 
the tribes were named are the subject, a second arcanum is to be brought to light, namely the meaning which each son carries. In heaven all celestial and spiritual warmth, or love and charity, is in 
its external form felt as the glow from the sun, and in heaven all celestial and spiritual light, or faith, is in its external form seen as the light from the sun. Also that celestial and spiritual warmth 
holds wisdom within itself, and the light from that source holds intelligence, and they do so because they flow from the Lord, who is the Sun of heaven, see <a href="1053.htm">1053</a>, <a href="1521.htm">1521</a>-<a href="1533.htm">1533</a>, <a href="1619.htm">1619</a>-<a href="1632.htm">1632</a>, <a href="2441.htm">2441</a>, <a href="2495.htm">2495</a>, <a href="2776.htm">2776</a>, <a href="3138.htm">3138</a>, <a href="3167.htm">3167</a>, <a href="3190.htm">3190</a>, <a href="3195.htm">3195</a>, <a href="3222.htm">3222</a>, <a href="3223.htm">3223</a>, <a href="3338.htm">3338</a>, <a href="3339.htm">3339</a>, <a href="3341.htm">3341</a>, <a href="3413.htm">3413</a>, <a href="3485.htm">3485</a>, <a href="3636.htm">3636</a>, <a href="3643.htm">3643</a>. These paragraphs show that all good is a product of the warmth which flows from the Lord as the Sun, and that all 
truth is a product of the light from that source. They also show that all affections which go with love or good are variations of that celestial and spiritual warmth flowing from the Lord, and that this 
is the origin of changes of state. They show too that all thoughts which go with truth or faith are variations of that celestial and spiritual light which flows from the Lord, and that this is the 
origin of intelligence. All angels in heaven are bathed in that warmth and light. Their affections and thoughts have no other source, nor are they anything else. This is evident from the different forms 
of communication employed by the angels, in that because those forms of communication have their origin in heavenly warmth and light, they consist of variations and modifications of heavenly light 
containing heavenly warmth, and are therefore indescribable and so varying and complete as to be quite beyond one's comprehension, <a href="3342.htm">3342</a>, <a href="3344.htm">3344</a>, <a href="3345.htm">3345</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 So that these things might be manifested in 
a representative way in the world names were given to each of the sons of Jacob which meant the universal divisions of good and truth, or of love and faith, and so the universal manifestations of variation 
in celestial and spiritual warmth and of variation in light from that source. What determines the intensity of the flame and the brightness from it is the actual order of those universal manifestations. 
When love comes first in such order, everything which follows within genuine order from that love is flaming, but when faith comes first everything which follows within genuine order is full 
of light, yet with all the differences that the things which follow entail. If however they do not follow according to genuine order everything is obscure, and in ever differing ways. But this order 
and resulting differences will in the Lord's Divine mercy be discussed later on. This then is how the Lord gave answers by means of the Urim and Thummim and how according to the state of the actual thing 
in question they received answers by means of lights and their flashes from the precious and transparent stones on which the names of the twelve tribes had been inscribed. For as has been stated, 
inscribed on the names were the universal divisions of love and faith which exist in the Lord's kingdom and so the universal manifestations of flame and light by which those divisions of love and faith 
are represented in heaven. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 First therefore let evidence from the Word be presented to confirm that the order of the names in which the tribes are mentioned varies in the Word, and that each variation 
of their order is determined by the particular state of the subject under discussion there. And from such evidence one may see that the answers from the Lord given by means of the Urim and Thummim 
were radiations of light determined by the particular states of the thing - such variations being due to the order of all that was involved. For the entire light of heaven is made to vary by the 
different states which that thing passes through, and those states are made to vary by the order in which good and truth come. But which aspect of truth or good is meant by each name will be evident 
from the explanation that is being given. That is to say, Reuben means faith from the Lord; Simeon faith possessed by the will which is received from the Lord; Levi spiritual love, which is charity; Judah 
the Divinity of love, and the Lord's heavenly kingdom. What the other eight mean will be stated in the next chapter. Described here is the order in which they were born, which was as follows: Reuben, 
Simeon, Levi, Judah, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, Benjamin - see verses 32-35 of the present chapter, and <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=then%2030:6,%208,%2011,%2013,%2018,%2020,%2024;%2035:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">then 30:6, 8, 11, 13, 18, 20, 24; 35:18</a>. This order is determined 
by the state of the subject that is being dealt with at this point, which is that of the regeneration of man, for this starts with the truth of faith, meant by 'Reuben', progresses from this towards 
the willing of truth, meant by 'Simeon', and from this to charity, meant by 'Levi', and so on to the Lord, who is meant in the highest sense by 'Judah'. The progression of spiritual conception and birth, 
or regeneration, from what is external to what is internal has been stated immediately above in <a href="3860.htm">3860</a>; that is, the progression is from the truth of faith to the good of love. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Before Jacob 
came to Isaac his father in Mamre, or Kiriath Arba, his sons are mentioned in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2035:23-26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 35:23-26</a> in the following order: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, Benjamin, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, 
Asher. In this case those by Leah and Rachel come first, and those by the servant-girls last, this being determined by the state of the subject dealt with at that point. They are listed in yet another 
order when they travelled and came into Egypt, in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2046:9-19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 46:9-19</a>; in another when before his death they were blessed by Jacob, who by then was Israel, in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2049:3-27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 49:3-27</a>; and in another again when blessed 
by Moses, in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2033:6-24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 33:6-24</a>. And when they encamped around the Tent of Meeting they did so in the following order: To the east Judah, Issachar, Zebulun; to the south Reuben, Simeon, Gad; to the west 
Ephraim, Manasseh, Benjamin; to the north Dan, Asher, Naphtali, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%202:1-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 2:1-end</a>. In what order they stood on Mount Gerizim to bless the people, or on Mount Ebal to curse them, see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2027:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 27:12, 13</a>. When 
the princes chosen from each tribe were sent to spy out the land they are listed in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2013:4-16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 13:4-16</a> in the following order: Reuben, Simeon, Judah, Issachar, Ephraim, Benjamin, Zebulun, Joseph or Manasseh, 
Dan, Asher, Naphtali, Gad. But there is a different order to the princes who were to divide the land for inheritance, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2034:19-29&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 34:19-29</a>. In what order the lot fell when it was cast, at the time that the 
land was divided for inheritance, see Chapters <a href="13.htm">13</a>-<a href="19.htm">19</a> of Joshua. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 When the boundaries of the new or holy land which the tribes were to inherit are referred to in Ezekiel the tribes are mentioned 
in the following order: Dan, Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh, Ephraim, Reuben, Judah, Benjamin, Simeon, Issachar, Zebulun, Gad. All are described from the corner pointing east to the corner pointing to the 
sea or west, except Gad which was situated at the south corner pointing towards the south, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2048:1-7,%2023-26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 48:1-7, 23-26</a>. And where the gates of the new or holy city are referred to they are mentioned in the following 
order: Facing north the three gates of Reuben, Judah, and Levi; facing east the three gates of Joseph, Benjamin, and Dan; facing south the three gates of Simeon, Issachar, and Zebulun; facing 
west the three gates of Gad, Asher, and Naphtali, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2048:31-34&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 48:31-34</a>. For the order of those sealed, twelve thousand from each tribe, see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%207:5-8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 7:5-8</a>. In all these places the listing of the tribes depends 
completely on the state of the subject dealt with, to which the order corresponds. That particular state is evident from what comes before and after. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 The order of the precious stones in the Urim 
and Thummim is mentioned and described in the Word, but which tribes individual stones corresponded to is not mentioned. For those stones represented all things belonging to the light shed by heavenly 
flame, that is, all aspects of truth originating in good, or of faith originating in charity. And because they represented these things heavenly light itself shone through them in a miraculous way 
in accordance with the state of the subject concerning which a question was asked and an answer was given. Flashing and bright light stood for a positive answer concerning good and truth, which light 
was accompanied by variations of the stones' colours according with the differences of the state of good and truth, as in heaven where all celestial and spiritual things are expressed by means of lights 
and their differences, and in a way beyond description and completely incomprehensible to man. For as has been shown frequently, heavenly light includes life from the Lord, and so includes wisdom 
and intelligence. Consequently the differences in light include everything that constitutes the life, that is, everything that constitutes wisdom and intelligence, while the differences in flaming, flashing, 
and shining include everything that constitutes the life of good and the life of truth received from good, that is, of love to the Lord and of faith derived from that love. Such then were the 
Urim and Thummim which were on the breastplate of the ephod and were over Aaron's heart. The nature of them is also evident from the fact that the terms Urim and Thummim mean lights and perfections, and 
that the breastplate in which they were set is called the breastplate of judgement, because judgement consists in intelligence and wisdom, <a href="2235.htm">2235</a>. The reason it was worn over Aaron's heart was that 'the 
heart' means Divine love, see <a href="3635.htm">3635</a> and the section at the end of the present chapter. For this reason also those precious stones were placed in settings of gold, for 'gold' in the internal sense means 
good which is an attribute of love, <a href="113.htm">113</a>, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="1552.htm">1552</a>, and 'precious stone' truth which shines through from good, <a href="114.htm">114</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 The Urim and Thummim are spoken of in Moses as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
You shall make 
the breastplate of judgement, the work of designing, like the work of the ephod you shall make it; out of gold, violet, and purple, and twice-dyed scarlet, and of fine-twined linen you shall make it. 
It shall be square when doubled. And you shall set within it stone-settings, four rows of stones shall there be. There shall be sockets of gold in their settings. And the stones shall be according 
to the names of the sons of Israel, twelve according to their names. The engravings of a signet, each one according to its name, there shall be for the twelve tribes. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2028:15-21;%2039:8-14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 28:15-21; 39:8-14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Which 
stones had to be set in each row is also specified in those chapters. And further, </p>
<blockquote>
The breastplate shall not come away from the ephod. And Aaron shall bear the names of the sons of Israel on the breastplate 
of judgement over his heart when he goes into the holy place, for a remembrance before Jehovah continually. And you shall put into the breastplate of judgement the Urim and Thummim, and they 
shall be over Aaron's heart when he goes in before Jehovah. And Aaron shall bear the judgement of the sons of Israel over his heart before Jehovah continually. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2028:28-30&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 28:28-30</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%208:7,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 8:7, 8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The fact 
that Jehovah or the Lord was inquired of and gave answers by means of the Urim is seen in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah said to Moses, Take Joshua the son of Nun. You shall place some of your glory on him, so 
that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient. He shall stand before Eleazar the priest, and he shall inquire for him in the judgement of the Urim before Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2027:18,%2020&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 27:18, 20</a>, 
<a href="21.htm">21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in Samuel, </p>
<blockquote>
Saul inquired of Jehovah, but Jehovah did not answer him by dreams, or by the Urim, or by prophets. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1%20Sam%2028:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">1 Sam 28:6</a>.

Supra n. 3858 ostensum est quod `duodecim tribus' significaverint omnia veri et boni, seu fidei et amoris, nunc quia de singulis Jacobi filiis, ex quibus tribus nominatae sunt, agitur, ideo hic alterum 
arcanum aperiendum est, quid nempe involvunt.  Quod omnis calor caelestis et spiritualis, seu amor et charitas, in externa forma in caelo percipiatur sicut flammeum a sole, et quod omnis lux 
caelestis et spiritualis, seu fides, in externa forma in caelo appareat sicut lux quae a sole, tum quod calor ille caelestis et spiritualis in se habeat sapientiam, et quod lux inde in se habeat intelligentiam, 
et hoc quia a Domino, Qui ibi est Sol, videatur n. 1053, 1521-1533, 1619-1632, 2441, 2495, 2776, 3138, 3167, 3190, 3195, 3222, 3223, 3338, 3339 3341, 3413, 3485, 3636, 3643; inde patet 
quod omne bonum sit ex calore qui a Domino ut Sole, et quod omne verum sit ex luce inde; et quoque inde patet quod omnes affectiones quae sunt amoris seu boni, sint variationes caloris illius caelestis 
et spiritualis qui a Domino, et quod inde sint mutationes status; et quod omnes cogitationes quae sunt fidei seu veri, sint variegationes lucis illius caelestis et spiritualis quae a Domino, 
et quod inde sit intelligentia; in his sunt omnes angeli qui in caelo; eorum affectiones et cogitationes non aliunde sunt, et non aliud; hoc patet ab (c)eorum loquelis, quae quia inde {1}, sunt variegationes 
seu modificationes caelestis lucis {2}in qua caelestis calor, quare etiam ineffabiles sunt, et tali varietate (c)ac plenitudine ut incomprehensibiles, n. 3342, 3344, 3345.  [2]Ut haec 
repraesentative sisterentur in mundo, singulis Jacobi filiis indita sunt nomina, {3}quae universalia boni et veri, seu amoris et fidei, significarent, ita universalia quoad variationes caloris caelestis 
et spiritualis, et quoad variegationes lucis inde; ipse ordo universalium illorum est qui determinat flammam et splendorem inde; cum ordo incohat ab amore, tunc flammeum apparet omne quod in 
genuino ordine inde sequitur, cum autem ordo incohat a fide, tunc lucidum apparet omne quod in genuino ordine sequitur, sed cum omni differentia secundum illa quae sequuntur; (m){4}at si non secundum 
genuinum ordinem, quod obscurum cum omni differentia;(n) sed de ordine et inde differentia, in sequentibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, dicetur; inde nunc est quod Dominus per Urim et Thummim 
dederit responsa, et quod secundum statum rei responsa tulerint, per luces et earum exsplendescentiam ex lapidibus pretiosis et pellucidis, quibus nomina duodecim tribuum inscripta fuerunt; nam, ut 
dictum, nominibus inscripta fuerunt universalia amoris et fidei quae in regno Domini, proinde universalia flammae et lucis, per quas illa quae amoris et fidei sunt, in caelo repraesentantur. [3]Primum itaque

veri et boni per unumquemvis significatur, patebit ab explicatione, quod nempe per Reuben significetur fides a Domino, per Shimeonem fides voluntatis quae a Domino; per Levi amor spiritualis seu charitas; </p>
<p>per 
Jehudam  Divinum amoris et caeleste regnum Domini, quid autem per octo reliquos, in capite sequente dicetur.  Ordo eorum secundum nativitatem est qui hic describitur, in quo ita sequuntur:

statum rei de (x)qua hic agitur, qui est regenerationis hominis, tunc enim a vero fidei incohatur quod est `Reuben,' et progressus fit inde ad velle verum quod est `Shimeon': inde ad charitatem {1}quae 
est Levi; ita ad Dominum, Qui in supremo sensu est `Jehudas'; quod conceptio et partus spiritualis seu regeneratio sit ab externo ad internum, mox supra n. 3860 dictum, hoc est, a vero fidei 
ad bonum amoris. [4]Antequam venit Jacob ad Jishakum patrem suum in Mamre Kiriath Arba, in hoc ordine nominantur: Reuben Shimeon, Levi, Jehudas, Jisaschar, Zebulon, Joseph, Benjamin, Dan, Naphtali, 
Gad, Asher, Gen. xxxv 23-26, ubi primo loco sunt qui a Leah et Rachele, et postremo qui ab ancillis, et hoc secundum statum rei, de qua ibi agitur.  Alio adhuc ordine recensentur, cum profecti venerunt Aegyptum,

Naphtali, Num. ii 1 ad fin. {6}(m)Quo ordine steterunt ad benedicendum populo super monte Gerizim, et ad maledicendum super monte Ebal, videatur Deut. xxvii 12, 13. (n)Cum principes viri singuli: de

<p>ipse status rei patet ab illis quae ibi praecedunt et quae sequuntur.  [6] Qualis ordo lapidum pretiosorum in Urim et Thummim fuerit, in Verbo 
memoratur et describitur, sed quibusnam tribubus singuli lapides corresponderent, non memoratur; erant enim omnia lucis e flamma caelesti, hoc est, omnia veri ex bono, seu omnia fidei ex amore, quae

xxxix 8-14; </p>
<p>lapides quinam in unoquovis ordine, etiam ibi designantur; et porro,      Non recedet pectorale a super ephodo; et portabit Aharon      nomina filiorum Israelis in pectorali judicii 
super corde suo,      in ingrediendo illo ad sanctum, in memoriale coram Jehovah      jugiter et dabis ad pectorale judicii Urim et Thummim, et      erunt super corde Aharonis in ingrediendo illo coram 
Jehovah; </p>
<p>     et portabit Aharon judicium filiorum Israelis super corde suo      coram Jehovah jugiter, Exod. xxviii 28-30; Lev. viii 7, 8. Quod Jehovah seu Dominus per Urim interrogatus sit et 
responsa dederit, apud Mosen,      Dixit Jehovah ad Mosen, Sume Joshuam filium Nunis,... dabis de      gloria tua super eum, ut oboediat omnis congregati filiorum      Israelis: coram Eleazare sacerdote 
stabit, et interrogabit eum      in judicio Urim coram Jehovah, Num. xxvii 18, 20, 21: </p>
