Verses 59-61. And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant and his men. And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Our sister, be thou for thousands of ten thousands, 
and may thy seed inherit the gate of those that hate thee. And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man, and the servant took Rebekah and went away. "They 
sent away Rebekah their sister," signifies separation from the affection of Divine truth; "and her nurse," signifies from the innocence pertaining thereto; "and Abraham's servant and his men," signifies 
from Divine things in the natural man; "and they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her," signifies devout wishes from Divine enlightenment; "Our sister, be thou for thousands of ten thousands," signifies 
the fructification of the affection of truth to infinitude; "and may thy seed inherit the gate of those that hate thee," signifies the Lord's spiritual kingdom from the marriage of good and truth 
in the Divine Human, to which kingdom belong charity and faith where before were evil and falsity; "and Rebekah arose," signifies the elevation of the affection of truth, and the consequent separation; 
"and her damsels," signifies the subservient affections; "and they rode upon the camels," signifies the intellectual part elevated upon natural memory-knowledges; "and followed the man," signifies 
under the auspices of Divine truth natural; "and the servant took Rebekah and went away," signifies that Divine good natural performed the initiation. </p>

Vers. 59-61.  Et miserunt Rebeccam sororem suam, et nutricem ejus, et servum Abrahami, et viros ejus. Et benedixerunt Rebeccae, et dixerunt illi, Soror nostra tu sis in millia myriadis, et hereditet 
semen tuum portam osorum {1}tuorum. Et surrexit Rebecca, et puellae ejus, et equitabant super camelis, et ibant post virum; et accepit servus Rebeccam, et ivit. `Miserunt Rebeccam sororem suam' significat

{1}tuorum significat regnum spirituale Domini ex conjugio boni et veri in Divino Humano cui regno charitas et fides, ubi prius malum et falsum: `et surrexit Rebecca' significat affectionis veri elevationem 
et separationem inde: `et puellae ejus' significat affectiones inservientes: `et equitabant super camelis' significat intellectuale elevatum super scientifica naturalia: `et ibant post virum' 
significat ex auspicio Divini Veri naturalis: `et accepit servus Rebeccam et ivit' significat quod Divinum Bonum naturale initiaret. @1 Heb.=suorum$  </p>
