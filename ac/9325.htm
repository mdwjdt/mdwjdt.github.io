<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9325.</strong>“你的地上必没有坠胎的、不生育的”表良善和真理将按自己的适当次序，以连续的过程发展。这从“坠胎或不生育”和“地上”的含义清楚可知：“坠胎或不生育”是指按适当次序重生的过程，因而是指良善和真理将按自己的适当次序，以连续的过程发展，如下文所述；“地上”是指在教会中。在圣言中，“地”表示教会（参看<a href="566.htm">566</a>，<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>，<a href="1067.htm">1067</a>，<a href="1262.htm">1262</a>，<a href="1413.htm">1413</a>，<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>e，<a href="2571.htm">2571</a>，<a href="2928.htm">2928</a>，<a href="3355.htm">3355</a>，<a href="3368.htm">3368</a>，<a href="3379.htm">3379</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="4535.htm">4535</a>，<a href="5577.htm">5577</a>，<a href="8011.htm">8011</a>，<a href="8732.htm">8732</a>节）；“地”表示教会的原因是，它是指迦南地，教会存在的地方，事实上，自上古时期起，教会就一直存在于那里（<a href="3686.htm">3686</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="4454.htm">4454</a>，<a href="4516.htm">4516</a>，<a href="4517.htm">4517</a>，<a href="5136.htm">5136</a>，<a href="6516.htm">6516</a>，<a href="8317.htm">8317</a>节）。此外，在灵界，当提到地时，没有人会想到一块地，而是会想到住在那地的是什么人，以及他们的宗教信仰是何性质。因此，当圣言提到“地”，并且所指的是迦南地时，所想到的，就是教会。由此可见在圣言主的预言部分，“新天新地”表示什么，即：内在教会和外在教会（<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="3355.htm">3355</a>，<a href="4535.htm">4535</a>节）；因为既有内在人，也有外在人。<br />“地上必没有坠胎的、不生育的”之所以表示良善和真理将按自己的适当次序，以连续的过程发展，是因为就圣言的内义而言，凡与出生有关的一切，都表示诸如与属灵出生，因而与重生有关的那类事物（<a href="2584.htm">2584</a>，<a href="3860.htm">3860</a>，<a href="3905.htm">3905</a>，<a href="3915.htm">3915</a>节）。与属灵出生或重生有关的事物是信之真理和仁之良善，因为一个人通过这些被孕育和新生。“出生”表示这类事物，这一点从圣言中的许多经文，以及主对尼哥底母所说的话明显看出来：<br />耶稣对他说，我实实在在地告诉你：人若不重生，就不能见神的国。尼哥底母说，人已经老了，如何能出生呢？岂能再进母腹生出来吗？耶稣说，我实实在在地告诉你：人若不是从水和圣灵生的，就不能进神的国。从肉身生的，就是肉身；从灵生的，就是灵。尼哥底母说，怎能有这些事呢？耶稣回答说，你是以色列人的老师，还不明白这事吗？（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.3.htm">3:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.6.htm">6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.10.htm">10</a>）<br />“从水和圣灵生的”表示通过信之真理和爱之良善重生（参看<a href="9274.htm">9274</a>节所提到的章节）。<br />在圣言中，“出生”表示这类事物起源于地上婚姻和天上婚姻，也就是良善和真理的婚姻的对应关系（关于这种对应关系，可参看<a href="2727.htm">2727</a>-<a href="2759.htm">2759</a>节）。但如今，几乎没有人知道，恐怕几乎没有人愿意承认，真正的婚姻之爱是从该婚姻降下来的；因为尘世和肉体事物就在人们眼前，这些东西会抑制和窒息关于这种对应关系的一切思维。此外，由于真正的婚姻之爱来自这个源头，所以就圣言的内义而言，“出生”和“世代”表示与主所实现的新生和世代有关的事物。也正因如此，父亲、母亲、儿子、女儿、女婿、儿媳、孙子，以及源于婚姻的其他许多亲属，表示良善和真理，以及它们的衍生物，如在解释他们的章节多次所说明的。<br />由此可见“地上必没有坠胎的、不生育的”表示良善和真理将按自己的适当次序，以连续的过程发展。“坠胎的”和“不生育的”表示灵义上的坠胎和不生育，即对良善和真理的败坏，以及对它们的毁坏和彻底弃绝，这一点从下列经文明显看出来：<br />我看以法莲直达推罗，它栽于美地。以法莲却要将自己的儿子带出来，交与行杀戮的人。耶和华啊，求你加给他们胎坠乳干。因他们的恶行，我要把他们从我的家里赶出来。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何9.13.htm">9:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何9.15.htm">15</a>）<br />人若不知道“以法莲”、“推罗”、“杀戮的人”、“儿女”、“胎坠”、“乳干”在内义上表示什么，根本不可能知道这些预言含有什么意思。“以法莲”是指教会的理解力，也就是在从圣言所获得的信之真理和良善上被光照的一种理解力（参看<a href="3969.htm">3969</a>，<a href="5354.htm">5354</a>，<a href="6222.htm">6222</a>，<a href="6234.htm">6234</a>，<a href="6238.htm">6238</a>，<a href="6267.htm">6267</a>节）；“推罗”是指关于真理和良善的认知或知识（<a href="1201.htm">1201</a>节）。由此明显可知“我看以法莲直达推罗，它栽于美地”表示什么。“杀戮的人”是指一个剥夺别人的属灵生命，也就是真理和良善所提供的生命之人（参看<a href="3607.htm">3607</a>，<a href="6767.htm">6767</a>，<a href="8902.htm">8902</a>节）；“儿子”是指信之真理（<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>，<a href="2623.htm">2623</a>，<a href="2813.htm">2813</a>，<a href="3373.htm">3373</a>，<a href="3704.htm">3704</a>，<a href="4257.htm">4257</a>节）。由此明显可知“以法莲却要将自己的儿子带出来，交与行杀戮的人”表示什么。“乳（房）”是指对良善和真理的情感（参看<a href="6432.htm">6432</a>节），因此，“乳干”是指情感的缺乏或没有情感，取而代之的是败坏的恶欲。由此明显可知“胎坠”表示什么，即对良善和真理的败坏。所有这些话都表示与属灵生命有关的事物，这是显而易见的，因为经上说“因他们的恶行，我要把他们从我的家里赶出来”。“从耶和华的家里出来”是指从教会和天堂里出来（<a href="2233.htm">2233</a>，<a href="2234.htm">2234</a>，<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>，<a href="5640.htm">5640</a>节）。<br />玛拉基书：<br />我必为你们斥责吞噬者，不容他毁坏你们的土产。你们田间的葡萄树也不掉果子。众族都必称你们为有福的，你们必成为喜乐之地！（玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛3.11.htm">3:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛3.12.htm">12</a>）<br />“田间的葡萄树不掉果子”这句预言表示那些在教会里的人当中的信之真理和良善将按自己的适当次序发展；因为“葡萄树”表示属灵教会的真理和良善（<a href="1069.htm">1069</a>，<a href="6375.htm">6375</a>，<a href="6376.htm">6376</a>，<a href="9277.htm">9277</a>节）；“田”是指教会（<a href="2971.htm">2971</a>，<a href="3766.htm">3766</a>，<a href="7502.htm">7502</a>，<a href="9139.htm">9139</a>，<a href="9295.htm">9295</a>节）。“喜乐之地”是指主所喜悦的一个教会；因为在教会中，已经通过真理和良善重生的每个人都是一个教会。这表明“你们必成为喜乐之地”表示什么，“地”是指教会（参看前面）。<br />摩西五经：<br />你们若听从我的典章，谨守遵行，必蒙福胜过万民，在你中间没有不能生育的男女，在你的牲畜中也没有不能生育的。耶和华必使一切的病症、埃及各样的恶疾离开你。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.12.htm">7:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.15.htm">15</a>）<br />“没有不能生育的男女”表示不缺乏真理和良善所提供的生命；因此，这是一个应许，即：他们必在灵性上拥有生命。由于“不生育”具有这种含义，所以在古代的教会，女人若不生育，就觉得自己没有生命。拉结就是这样，她向雅各如此论到自己：<br />拉结见自己不给雅各生子，对雅各说，你给我儿子，不然我就死了。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创30.1.htm">30:1</a>；<w1>3908<w2>3908<w3>节）<br />“不生育”还表示那些因没有真理而没有良善，然而却渴望真理，以便能处于良善的人，如教会之外正直民族的情形。以赛亚书就有这种含义的例子：<br />你这不怀孕、不生育的要歌唱！你这未曾经过产难的要以歌唱回应，以喜乐呼喊！因为凄凉独居者的儿子比已婚的更多。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛54.1.htm">54:1</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />耶和华从灰尘里抬举压伤之人，从粪堆中提拔穷乏人，使他与祂百姓的首领同坐。祂使不能生育的妇人安居家中，为多子的乐母。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗113.7.htm">113:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗113.9.htm">9</a>）<br />在哈拿生了撒母耳之后的预言中：<br />饱足的，作雇工求食；饥饿的，再不饥饿。不生育的，生了七个儿子；多有儿女的，反倒衰微。（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上2.5.htm">2:5</a>）<br />在这些经文中，“不生育的”表示正被召唤到教会的外邦民族，当旧教会结束时，也就是说，当以前属于教会的人因没有任何仁爱而不再有信仰时，教会就转交给他们。这旧教会由“多有儿女，反倒衰微的”和“已婚的”来表示；而外邦民族当中的新教会则由“不生育，多有儿女的凄凉独居者”，以及“不能生育、安居家中，为多子乐母的妇人”来表示。“生七个”表示完全重生，因为在这段预言中，“七”并非表示七个，而是表示完全（参看<a href="9228.htm">9228</a>节）。由此明显可知主所说的下面这些话表示什么：<br />日子要到，人必说，不生育的，没有生产过的母腹，和未曾乳养过的胸，有福了！（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路23.29.htm">23:29</a>）<br />这论及时代的完结，也就是教会的末期。<br />列王纪下：<br />耶利哥城的人对以利沙说，看哪，这城的地势美好，只是水恶劣，地不能生产。以利沙吩咐他们拿一个新盘，将盘里的盐倒在水源。于是那水治好了，再也没有死亡或不能生产的事从它而来了。（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下2.19.htm">2:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下2.21.htm">21</a>）<br />若不通过内义，没有人知道这段描述包含着什么；因为圣言中所描述的一切奇迹都含有发生在主国度或教会中的那类事在里面（<a href="7337.htm">7337</a>，<a href="7465.htm">7465</a>，<a href="8364.htm">8364</a>，<a href="9086.htm">9086</a>节）。因此，有必要知道“以利沙”代表什么，“耶利哥城”表示什么，“恶劣的水和不能生产的地”、“一个新盘和盘里的盐”，以及他们要将盐所倒进的水源分别表示什么。“以利沙”代表圣言方面的主（参看<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>节）；“水”表示信之真理（<a href="28.htm">28</a>，<a href="2702.htm">2702</a>，<a href="3058.htm">3058</a>，<a href="3424.htm">3424</a>，<a href="4976.htm">4976</a>，<a href="5668.htm">5668</a>，<a href="6346.htm">6346</a>，<a href="7307.htm">7307</a>，<a href="8137.htm">8137</a>，<a href="8138.htm">8138</a>，<a href="8568.htm">8568</a>节），所以“恶劣的水”表示没有良善的真理；而“不能生产的地”表示因此不是活着的教会良善；“一个新盘”或一个新器皿表示关于良善和真理的记忆知识或认知（<a href="3068.htm">3068</a>，<a href="3079.htm">3079</a>，<a href="3316.htm">3316</a>，<a href="3318.htm">3318</a>节）；“盐”表示真理对良善的渴望（<a href="9207.htm">9207</a>节）；“水源”表示接受关于真理和良善的认知或知识，并被真理对良善的渴望改善的人的属世层。<br />由此明显可知，这个奇迹包含什么，即：教会及其生命被主的圣言和由此而来的真理对良善的渴望改善。当此人的属世层由于这种渴望而从圣言接受真理时，这种改善就实现了。这个奇迹之所以发生在耶利哥城，是因为该城距离约旦河不远；而“约旦河”表示在一个教会成员里面那首先接受真理的，也就是属世层（<a href="1585.htm">1585</a>，<a href="4255.htm">4255</a>节）。正是人的属世层首先从主接受存在于圣言中的真理，但最后重生的，也就是它；它重生了，整个人就重生了。主给门徒洗脚时，对彼得所说的话就表示这一点：<br />耶稣说，凡洗过澡的人，只要把脚一洗，全身就干净了。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.10.htm">13:10</a>）<br />“脚”是指属世人的事物，一般是指属世层本身（参看<a href="2162.htm">2162</a>，<a href="3147.htm">3147</a>，<a href="3761.htm">3761</a>，<a href="3986.htm">3986</a>，<a href="4280.htm">4280</a>，<a href="4938.htm">4938</a>-<a href="4952.htm">4952</a>，<a href="5327.htm">5327</a>，<a href="5328.htm">5328</a>节）。如果一个人要重生，那么属世人或外在人就必须与属灵人或内在人保持一致；因此，只有等到属世人重生，人才会重生（参看<a href="2850.htm">2850</a>，<a href="3167.htm">3167</a>，<a href="3286.htm">3286</a>，<a href="3321.htm">3321</a>，<a href="3470.htm">3470</a>，<a href="3493.htm">3493</a>，<a href="3508.htm">3508</a>，<a href="3509.htm">3509</a>，<a href="3518.htm">3518</a>，<a

There shall not be one miscarrying, or barren, in thy land. That this signifies that goods and truths will proceed in their order in continual progression, is evident from the signification of "not miscarrying, 
or being barren," as being the progress of regeneration in its order, consequently that goods and truths will proceed in their order in continual progression (of which below); and from the 
signification of "in the land," as being in the church (That "land" in the Word denotes the church, see n. 566, 662, 1066, 1067, 1262, 1413, 1607, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 2571, 2928, 3355, 3368, 3379, 
4447, 4535, 5577, 8011, 8732.) The reason why "the land" signifies the church, is that the land of Canaan is meant, where the church was, and where it had been from the most ancient times (n. 3686, 
4447, 4454, 4516, 4517, 5136, 6516, 8317); and in the spiritual world when a land is mentioned, no land is perceived, but the quality of the nation therein in respect to religion. Therefore when "land" 
is mentioned in the Word, and the land of Canaan is meant, the church is perceived. From all this it can be seen what is meant in the prophetical parts of the Word by "a new heaven and a new land," 
namely, the church internal and external (n. 1850, 3355, 4535); for there are internal men and external men. [2] That by "there shall not be one miscarrying, or barren, in the land" is signified that 
goods and truths proceed in their order in continual progression, is because by all things belonging to birth are meant in the internal sense of the Word such things as belong to spiritual birth, thus 
to regeneration (n. 2584, 3860, 3905, 3915). The things that belong to spiritual birth or regeneration are the truths of faith and the goods of charity, for by means of these a man is conceived and 
born anew. That such things are signified by "births," is plain from many passages in the Word, and openly from the words of the Lord to Nicodemus: </p>
<p>     Jesus said to him, Verily, verily, I say unto 
thee, Except a man be born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus saith, How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born? Jesus answered, 
Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the spirit 
is spirit. Nicodemus said, How can these things be? Jesus answered, Art thou a teacher in Israel, and knowest not these things? (John 3:3-6, 9, 10); </p>
<p>"to be born of water and the spirit" denotes through 
the truths of faith and the good of love (see the passages cited in n. 9274). [3] That such things are signified in the Word by "births," is from the correspondence of marriages on earth with the 
heavenly marriage, which is the marriage of good and truth (of which correspondence see above, n. 2727-2759). But at the present day scarcely anyone knows, and perhaps scarcely anyone is willing to acknowledge, 
that love truly conjugial descends from thence, for the reason that earthly and bodily things are before the eyes, and these extinguish and suffocate all thought about such a correspondence. 
As love truly conjugial is from this source, therefore in the internal sense of the Word "births," and "generations," signify the things of the new birth and generation from the Lord. Hence also it 
is that "father," "mother," "sons," "daughters," "sons-in-law," "daughters-in-law," "grandsons," and many other relations derived from marriages, signify goods and truths and their derivations, as frequently 
shown in these explications. From all this it can now be seen that by "there shall not be one miscarrying, or barren, in the land" is signified that goods and truths shall proceed in their order 
in continual progression. [4] That "one miscarrying," and "one barren," signify what belongs to miscarriage and barrenness in a spiritual sense, namely, perversions of good and truth, and also vastations 
and denials of good and truth, is evident from the following passages: </p>
<p>     Ephraim, when I have seen it even to Tyre, was planted in beauty; but Ephraim shall bring forth his sons to the slayer. 
Give them, O Jehovah, a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. Because of the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of My house (Hos. 9:13-15); </p>
<p>unless it is known what is signified in the 
internal sense by "Ephraim," "Tyre," "a slayer," "sons," "a miscarrying womb," and "dry breasts," it cannot in the least be known what these prophetic words involve. That "Ephraim" denotes the intellect 
of the church, which is an intellect enlightened in respect to the goods and truths of faith derived from the Word, may be seen above (n. 3969, 5354, 6222, 6234, 6238, 6267); and also that "Tyre" 
denotes the knowledges of truth and good (n. 1201). From this it is plain what is signified by "Ephraim, when I have seen it even to Tyre, was planted in beauty." That "a slayer" denotes one who deprives 
of spiritual life, that is, of the life from truth and good, may also be seen above (n. 3607, 6767, 8902); and that "sons" denote the truths of faith (n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 2813, 3373, 3704, 
4257). From this it is plain what is signified by "Ephraim bringing forth his sons to the slayer." That "the breasts" denote the affections of good and truth, may also be seen (n. 6432); consequently 
"breasts that are dry" denote no affections; but in their place evil desires to pervert. From this it is plain what is meant by "a miscarrying womb," namely, the perversion of good and truth. That 
all these expressions signify things of spiritual life is evident, for it is declared, "because of the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of My house." "Out of the house of Jehovah" denotes 
out of the church and of heaven (n. 2233, 2234, 3720, 5640).  [5] In Malachi: </p>
<p>     I will rebuke the devourer for you, that he may not spoil for you the fruit of the land; neither shall the vine 
in the field miscarry for you. All nations shall proclaim you blessed; and ye shall be a well-pleasing land (Mal. 3:11-12); </p>
<p>by "the vine in the field not miscarrying" is signified that the truths and 
goods of faith with those who are in the church shall proceed in their order; for "the vine" denotes the truth and good of the spiritual church (n. 1069, 6375, 6376, 9277); and "the field" denotes the 
church (n. 2971, 3766, 7502, 9139, 9295). "A well-pleasing land" denotes a church that is pleasing to the Lord; for everyone within the church who has been regenerated through truth and good is a church; 
which shows what is meant by "ye shall be a well-pleasing land." (That "land" denotes the church, may be seen above.) [6] In Moses: </p>
<p>     If ye hearken to My judgments to keep and do them, thou 
shalt be blessed above every people; there shall not be in thee, nor in thy beast, any male unfruitful, or any female barren. Jehovah will take away from thee all sickness, and all the evil diseases 
of Egypt (Deut. 7:12, 14, 15); </p>
<p>that "there shall not be any male unfruitful, or any female barren" denotes not any without life from truth and good; thus that they shall be spiritually alive. As "barren" 
had this signification, the women in the ancient churches deemed themselves devoid of life when they were barren; as did Rachel, who thus spoke of herself to Jacob: </p>
<p>     Rachel saw that she did 
not bear to Jacob, and she said to Jacob, Give me sons, and if not, I am dead (Gen. 30:1; n. 3908). [7] By "the barren" are also signified those who are not in good because not in truths, and yet long 
for truths that they may be in good; as is the case with upright nations outside the church; as in these passages: </p>
<p>     Sing, O barren, that didst not bear; break forth into singing and shout for 
joy, that didst not bring forth; for more are the sons of her that is desolate than the sons of her that is married (Isa. 54:1).      Jehovah raiseth up the worn one out of the dust, He exalteth the 
needy one from the dunghill; to place him with the prince of his people. He maketh her that is barren to keep house, a glad mother of sons (Ps. 113:7-9). [8] In the prophecy of Hannah after she had borne 
Samuel: </p>
<p>      The full have hired themselves out, and the hungry have ceased; until the barren one hath borne seven, and she that hath many children hath failed (1 Sam. 2:5). In the above passages 
by "the barren" are meant the Gentiles who are summoned to the church, and to whom the church is transferred when the old church ceases, that is, when those who before had been of the church are no 
longer in faith, because in no charity. This church is what is meant by "her that hath many children and hath failed," and also by "her that is married," in the passage from Isaiah. But the other church, 
that is, the new church of the Gentiles, is meant by the "barren one" and "her that is desolate" who shall have many sons, and also by "her that is barren keeping house, a glad mother of sons." 
"To bear seven" denotes to be regenerated to the full; for "seven" there does not mean seven, but to the full (see n. 9228). From all this it is evident what is meant by the following words of the Lord: </p>
<p> 
    The days come in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that have not brought forth, and the breasts that have not given suck (Luke 23:29); </p>
<p>where the subject treated of 
is the consummation of the age, which is the last time of the church. [9] In the second book of Kings: </p>
<p>     The men of Jericho said unto Elisha, Behold the situation of this city is good; but the waters 
are evil, and the land is barren. Then Elisha said that they should put salt in a new cruse, and should cast the salt therefrom at the outlet of the waters; and the waters were healed, neither came 
there any more death or barrenness (2 Kings 2:19-21). No one can know what these words infold within them except from the internal sense; for all the miracles related in the Word infold within them 
such things as are in the Lord's kingdom, or in the church (n. 7337, 7465, 8364, 9086); and therefore it is necessary to know what was represented by Elisha, what was signified by the city of Jericho, 
what by the evil waters and the barren land, what by a new cruse and the salt in it, and also what by the outlet of the waters into which they were to cast the salt. That Elisha represented the Lord 
as to the Word, see n. 2762; that "waters" signify the truths of faith, n. 28, 2702, 3058, 3424, 4976, 5668, 6346, 7307, 8137, 8138, 8568; thus "evil waters" signify truths without good, and "a barren 
land" signifies the good of the church consequently not alive; "a new cruse," that is, a new vessel, signifies knowledges of good and truth (n. 3068, 3079, 3316, 3318); "salt" signifies the longing 
of truth for good (n. 9207); "the outlet of the waters" signifies the natural of man which receives the knowledges of truth and good, and which is amended by the longing of truth for good. [10] From 
all this it is evident that this miracle infolded within it the amendment of the church and of the life by the Lord through the Word, and through the consequent longing of truth for good; which amendment 
is effected when from such a longing the man's natural receives truths from the Word. That this took place near the city of Jericho, was because this city was situated not far from the Jordan; and 
by "the Jordan" is signified that in the man of the church which first receives truths, thus the natural (n. 1585, 4255). That it is man's natural which first receives truths out of the Word from the 
Lord, and that it is the last to be regenerated, and that when it has been regenerated, the whole man is regenerated, was signified by the Lord's words to Peter, when He washed the disciples' feet: </p>
<p> 
    Jesus said, He that is washed needeth not save to have his feet washed, and is clean every whit (John 13:10); </p>
<p>(that the "feet" denote the things of the natural man, and in general the natural itself, 
see n. 2162, 3147, 3761, 3986, 4280, 4938-4952, 5327, 5328). (That for a man to be regenerated, the natural or external man must be in correspondence with the spiritual or internal man; thus that 
he is not regenerate until the natural has been regenerated, see n. 2850, 3167, 3286, 3321, 3470, 3493, 3508, 3509, 3518, 3573, 3576, 3579, 3620, 3623, 3671, 3882, 3969, 4353, 4588, 4612, 4618, 5168, 
5326, 5373, 5651, 6299, 6454, 7442, 7443, 8742-8747, 9043, 9046, 9061.) </p>

'None will suffer miscarriage or be barren in [your] land' means that forms of good and truths will develop in their proper order, in continuous progression. This is clear from the meaning of 'none will 
suffer miscarriage or be barren' as the process of regeneration in its proper order, and therefore the development of forms of good and of truths in their proper order, in continuous progression, 
dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'in the land' as in the Church. In the Word 'the land' or 'the earth' means the Church, see <a href="566.htm">566</a>, <a href="662.htm">662</a>, <a href="1066.htm">1066</a>, <a href="1067.htm">1067</a>, <a href="1262.htm">1262</a>, <a href="1413.htm">1413</a>, <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>, <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="1850.htm">1850</a>, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>, <a href="2118.htm">2118</a> (end), <a href="2571.htm">2571</a>, <a href="2928.htm">2928</a>, <a href="3355.htm">3355</a>, <a href="3368.htm">3368</a>, <a href="3379.htm">3379</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="4535.htm">4535</a>, <a href="5577.htm">5577</a>, <a href="8011.htm">8011</a>, <a href="8732.htm">8732</a>; and the reason why 'the land' means the Church is that it implies the land of Canaan, where the Church existed, indeed where it had existed 
since most ancient times, <a href="3686.htm">3686</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="4454.htm">4454</a>, <a href="4516.htm">4516</a>, <a href="4517.htm">4517</a>, <a href="5136.htm">5136</a>, <a href="6306.htm">6306</a>, <a href="6516.htm">6516</a>, <a href="8317.htm">8317</a>. In the spiritual world furthermore, when a land is spoken of no one envisages a land but what the people and their religion 
in a land are like. Consequently when 'the land' is mentioned in the Word and it implies the land of Canaan, the Church is envisaged. All this goes to show what a new heaven and a new earth is 
used to mean in the prophetical parts of the Word, namely the internal Church and the external Church, <a href="1850.htm">1850</a>, <a href="3355.htm">3355</a>, <a href="4535.htm">4535</a>; for there are internal people and there are external people.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason 
why 'none will suffer miscarriage or be barren in the land' means that forms of good and truths will develop in their proper order, in continuous progression, is that all things connected with childbirth 
are used in the internal sense of the Word to mean such things as are connected with spiritual birth, thus such as are connected with regeneration, <a href="2584.htm">2584</a>, <a href="3860.htm">3860</a>, <a href="3868.htm">3868</a>, <a href="3905.htm">3905</a>, <a href="3915.htm">3915</a>. The things connected 
with spiritual birth or regeneration are the truths of faith and forms of the good of charity; for through these a person is conceived and born anew. It is evident from a large number of places in 
the Word that such things are meant by 'births', and plainly so from the Lord's words to Nicodemus,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said to him, Truly, truly I say to you, Unless a person is born again he cannot see the 
kingdom of God. Nicodemus said, How can a person be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born? Jesus answered, Truly, truly I say to you, Unless a person has been 
born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which has been born of the flesh is flesh, but that which has been born of the Spirit is spirit. Nicodemus said, How can these 
things happen? Jesus answered, Are you a teacher in Israel, and do not know these things? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:3-6,%209,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3:3-6, 9, 10</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Being born through water and the Spirit' means being born again through the truths of 
faith and the good of love, see the places referred to in <a href="9274.htm">9274</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The origin of this meaning of 'births' in the Word lies in the correspondence of marriages on earth with the heavenly marriage, 
which is the marriage of goodness and truth. Regarding this correspondence, see <a href="2727.htm">2727</a>-<a href="2759.htm">2759</a>. But scarcely anyone at the present day knows, and perhaps scarcely anyone is willing to recognize that truly 
conjugial love comes down from that marriage; for earthly and bodily things are before people's eyes, and those things have a dampening and smothering effect when they think about such correspondence. 
Furthermore, since that is the source of truly conjugial love, 'births' and 'generations' in the internal sense of the Word mean things connected with new birth and generation effected by the Lord. 
So it is also that father, mother, sons, daughters, sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, grandsons, and many more who are the product of marriages, mean forms of good and truths, and derivations from them, 
dealt with many times in explanatory sections.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 From all this it now becomes clear that 'none will suffer miscarriage or be barren in the land' means that forms of good and truths will develop 
in their proper order, in continuous progression. The fact that 'one suffering miscarriage' and 'one who is barren' mean instances of miscarriage and barrenness in a spiritual sense, that is, the perversions 
of goodness and truth, and also the destruction and total rejections of them, is evident from the following places: In Hosea,  </p>
<blockquote>
Ephraim, when I saw it reaching as far as Tyre, was planted in 
a beautiful [place]; and Ephraim must lead out its sons to the killer. Give them, O Jehovah, a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. On account of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of 
My house. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%209:13-15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 9:13-15</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Unless people know what it is that 'Ephraim', 'Tyre', 'the killer', 'sons', 'a miscarrying womb', and 'dry breasts' mean in the internal sense, they cannot have any knowledge 
at all of what those prophetic statements imply. 'Ephraim' is the Church's power of understanding, which is an understanding enlightened in regard to the truths and forms of the good of faith obtained 
from the Word, see <a href="3969.htm">3969</a>, <a href="5354.htm">5354</a>, <a href="6222.htm">6222</a>, <a href="6234.htm">6234</a>, <a href="6238.htm">6238</a>, <a href="6267.htm">6267</a>; 'Tyre' is the cognitions or knowledge of truth and good, <a href="1201.htm">1201</a>; and from this it is evident what 'Ephraim, when I saw it reaching as far as Tyre, 
was planted in a beautiful place' means. 'A killer' is one who deprives another of spiritual life, that is, the life provided by truth and good, <a href="3607.htm">3607</a>, <a href="6767.htm">6767</a>, <a href="8902.htm">8902</a>; 'sons' are the truths of faith,

'Breasts' are affections for goodness and truth, <a href="6432.htm">6432</a>, so that 
'dry breasts' are the absence of affections, and desires to pervert instead; and from this it is evident what 'a miscarrying womb' means, namely a perversion of goodness and truth. Things connected with 
spiritual life are clearly meant by all these words, for it says, 'On account of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of My house', 'out of Jehovah's house' meaning out of the Church 
and out of heaven, <a href="2233.htm">2233</a>, <a href="2234.htm">2234</a>, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>, <a href="5640.htm">5640</a>.  </p>

 In Malachi,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will rebuke the devourer for you, so that he does not ruin for you the fruit of the land, nor will the vine in the field miscarry 
for you. All the nations will declare you blessed, and you will be a land of delight. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mal%203:11,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mal 3:11, 12</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>The prophecy that the vine in the field would not miscarry means that the truths and forms of 
the good of faith among those who are within the Church will develop in their proper order; for 'the vine' is the spiritual Church's truth and good, <a href="1069.htm">1069</a>, <a href="6375.htm">6375</a>, <a href="6376.htm">6376</a>, <a href="9277.htm">9277</a>, and 'the field' is the Church,

'A land of delight' is a Church pleasing to the Lord; for everyone within the Church who has been regenerated through truth and good is an embodiment of the Church. From 
this it is evident what it is that 'you will be a land of delight' means, 'a land' being the Church, see above.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
If you hear My judgements, to keep and do them, you will be blessed 
above every people; none will be unfruitful or barren among you, or among [your] beasts. Jehovah will take away all sickness from you, and all the evil diseases of Egypt. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%207:12,%2014,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 7:12, 14, 15</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'None 
will be unfruitful or barren' stands for not being devoid of the life provided by truth and good; thus it is a promise that spiritually they will have life. Since 'barrenness' had such a meaning, 
women in the ancient Churches did not think of themselves as being alive if they were barren. This was so with Rachel, who spoke of herself to Jacob - see <a href="3908.htm">3908</a> - in the following words,  </p>
<blockquote>
Rachel 
saw that she was not bearing Jacob [any children]; and she said to Jacob, Give me sons; if you do not, I am dead. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2030:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 30:1</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 'The barren' also means those who are without good because they do 
not possess truths, yet have a desire for truths in order that they may be governed by good, as with upright nations outside the Church. An example of this meaning occurs in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Sing, O barren 
one that did not bear; resound with singing and cry out with joy, O one that has not been in travail, for the sons of her that is desolate will be more than the sons of her that was married. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2054:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 54:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In David,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah lifts one who is crushed out of the dust, He raises the needy one from the dunghill, to set him with the princes of His people. He causes the barren one of the house to dwell 
as a joyful mother of children. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20113:7-9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 113:7-9</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 In Hannah's prophetic utterance after she had given birth to Samuel,  </p>
<blockquote>
The full have been hired out [for bread], and the hungry have ceased [to 
be hungry], till she who was barren has borne seven, while the one who has many children has become feeble. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1%20Sam%202:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">1 Sam 2:5</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In these places 'the barren' is used to mean gentile nations who are being 
summoned to the Church, and to whom the Church is transferred when the old Church has come to an end, that is, when those who formerly belonged to the Church no longer possess faith because they do 
not have any charity. This old Church is meant by 'the one who has many children has become feeble' and by 'her that was married', while the new one among gentile nations is meant by 'her that is barren 
and desolate who will have many more sons' and by 'the barren one of the house [who dwells as] a joyful mother of children'. 'Bearing seven' means being regenerated completely, for 'seven' in this 
prophetic utterance does not mean seven but to completion, <a href="9228.htm">9228</a>. From all this it is evident what the following words spoken by the Lord serve to mean,  </p>
<blockquote>
The days will come in which they will say, Blessed 
are the barren, and the wombs that have not borne, and the breasts which have not nursed! <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2023:29&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 23:29</a>.

<p>This refers to the close of the age, which is the final period of the Church.  </p>

<p><b>[9]</b>
 In 
the second Book of Kings,  </p>
<p>The men of Jericho said to Elisha, Behold, the city's situation is good, but the water is bad and the land barren. Then Elisha told them to put salt in a new dish and to 
throw the salt from it into the source of the water. And the water was healed, and no more death or barrenness came from it. <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 2:19-21.  </p>
<p>No one can know what this description holds within it 
except from the internal sense; for all the miracles described in the Word hold within them the kinds of things that happen within the Lord's kingdom, that is, within the Church, <a href="7337.htm">7337</a>, <a href="7465.htm">7465</a>, <a href="8364.htm">8364</a>, <a href="9086.htm">9086</a>. 
A person needs to know therefore what 'Elisha' represented, what 'the city of Jericho' meant, what 'bad water and barren land' meant, what 'a new dish and salt in it' meant, and also what 'the source 
of the water' into which they were to throw the salt meant. 'Elisha' represented the Lord in respect of the Word, see <a href="2762.htm">2762</a>. 'Water' means the truths of faith, <a href="28.htm">28</a>, <a href="2702.htm">2702</a>, <a href="3058.htm">3058</a>, <a href="3424.htm">3424</a>, <a href="4976.htm">4976</a>, <a href="5668.htm">5668</a>, <a href="6346.htm">6346</a>,

knowledge and cognitions of goodness and truth, <a href="3068.htm">3068</a>, <a href="3079.htm">3079</a>, <a href="3316.htm">3316</a>, <a href="3318.htm">3318</a>. 'Salt' means truth's desire for good, <a href="9207.htm">9207</a>. 'The source of the water' means the human natural which receives the cognitions 
or knowledge of truth and good and is improved by truth's desire for good.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[10]</b>
 From all this it is evident what that miracle held within it, namely the improvement of the Church and its life by 
the Lord's Word and by truth's desire for good from there. The improvement is brought about when the human natural receives truths from the Word as a result of such a desire. The reason why the miracle 
took place at the city of Jericho was that this city was located not far from the Jordan, and 'the Jordan' means that with a member of the Church which first receives truths, which is the natural, <a href="1585.htm">1585</a>, 
<a href="4255.htm">4255</a>. The human natural is the first to receive truths from the Lord which are present in the Word, but it is regenerated last; and when it has been regenerated the whole person has been regenerated. 
This was meant by the Lord's words to Peter when He washed the disciples' feet,  </p>
<p>Jesus said, He who has been washed has no need except to wash his feet, and the whole person is clean. John 13:10. 
 </p>
<p>'The feet' are those things that belong to the human natural, and in general are the natural, see <a href="2162.htm">2162</a>, <a href="3147.htm">3147</a>, <a href="3761.htm">3761</a>, <a href="3986.htm">3986</a>, <a href="4280.htm">4280</a>, <a href="4938.htm">4938</a>-<a href="4952.htm">4952</a>, <a href="5327.htm">5327</a>, <a href="5328.htm">5328</a>.

`Non erit abortiens et sterilis in terra [tua]': quod significet quod bona et vera suo ordine in continua progressione procedent, constat ex significatione `non abortiens et {1} sterilis esse' quod 
sit regenerationis progressivum in suo ordine, proinde quod bona et vera suo ordine in continua progressione procedent, de qua sequitur, et ex significatione `in terra' quod sit in Ecclesia; quod `terra' 
in Verbo sit Ecclesia, videatur n. 566, 662, 1066, 1067, 1262, 1413, 1607, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118 fin., 2571, 2928, 3355, 3368, 3379, 4447, 4535, 5577, 8011, 8732; quod `terra' significet Ecclesiam 
{2}, est quia intelligitur terra Canaan, ubi (t)Ecclesia erat, et ab antiquissimis temporibus fuerat, n. 3686, 4447, 4454, 4516, 4517, (x)5136, 6306, 6516, 8317; et in spirituali mundo cum nominatur 
terra, non percipitur terra, sed gentis quale ibi quoad (d)suum religiosum; inde cum terra nominatur {3} in Verbo et per eam intelligitur terra Canaan, percipitur Ecclesia; ex his {4} constare potest 
quid in propheticis Verbi intelligitur per novum caelum et novam terram, quod nempe Ecclesia interna et externa, n. 1850, 3355, 4535, sunt enim {5} homines interni et homines externi. 	[2] Quod `non 
erit abortiens et sterilis in terra' significet quod bona et vera suo ordine in continua progressione procedant {6}, est quia per omnia quae sunt `partus' in Verbi sensu interno intelligantur talia quae 
sunt partus spiritualis, ita quae sunt regenerationis, n. 2584, 3860, 3868, 3905, 3915; quae sunt partus spiritualis seu {7} regenerationis, sunt vera fidei et bona charitatis, nam per haec homo e 
novo concipitur et nascitur; quod talia per `partus' significentur, patet a pluribus locis in Verbo, et manifeste a Domini verbis ad Nicodemum, 	Jesus dixit illi, Amen, amen, dico tibi, Nisi quis generatur 
denuo, non potest videre regnum Dei; dixit Nicodemus, Quomodo potest homo (x)generari' cum senex est? num potest in uterum matris suae secundo ingredi, et generari? respondit Jesus, Amen, amen, 
dico tibi, Nisi quis generatus fuerit ex aqua et Spiritu, non potest ingredi in regnum Dei; quod natum est ex carne, caro est, sed quod generatum est a Spiritu, spiritus est; dixit Nicodemus, Quomodo 
possunt haec fieri? respondit Jesus, Tune es magister in Israel, et haec non nosti? Joh. iii 3-6, 9, 10; </p>
<p>`generari per aquam et Spiritum' est per vera fidei et bonum amoris, videantur loca citata n. 
9274; [3] quod talia significentur per `partus' in Verbo, est ex correspondentia conjugiorum in terris cum conjugio caelesti, quod est conjugium boni et veri, de qua correspondentia videatur n. 2727-2759; 
sed quod inde amor vere conjugialis descendat, vix hodie aliquis novit, et forte vix aliquis agnoscere vult, quia terrena et corporea ante oculos sunt, quae exstinguunt et suffocant {8}, quando 
{9} de tali correspondentia cogitant; quia amor vere conjugialis inde est, ideo quoque per `partus et {10} generationes' in sensu Verbi interno `significantur' quae sunt partus et generationis novae 
a Domino; inde quoque est quod pater, mater, filii, filiae, generi, nurus, nepotes, et plures qui sunt ex conjugiis, significent bona et vera ac derivationes eorum, de quibus pluries in explicationibus. 
 Ex his nunc constare potest quod per `non erit abortiens et sterilis in terra' significetur quod bona et vera suo ordine in continua progressione procedent. 	[4] Quod `abortiens et sterilis' significent 
{11} illa quae sunt abortus et sterilitatis in sensu spirituali, quae sunt perversiones boni et veri, tum vastationes et negationes (c)eorum, patet ea sequentibus his locis: apud Hoscheam, 	Ephraim 
quando vidi usque ad Tyrum, plantata in pulchro; et Ephraim ad educendum ad occisorem filios suos; da illis, Jehovah, vulvam abortientem et ubera arentia: propter malitiam operum illorum expellam 
illos e domo Mea, ix 13-15; </p>
<p>nisi sciatur quid significatur per `Ephraim,' per `Tyrum,' per `occisorem,' per `filios,' per `vulvam abortientem,' per `ubera arentia,' in sensu interno, prorsus non 
sciri potest quid prophetica illa involvunt; quod `Ephraim' sit intellectuale Ecclesiae, quod est intellectuale illustratum de veris et bonis fidei ex Verbo, videatur n. 3969, 5354, 6222, (x) 6234, 6238, 
6267, quod `Tyrus' sint cognitiones veri et boni, n. 1201, inde patet quid significatur per `Ephraim quando vidi usque ad Tyrum, plantatum in pulchro'; quod `occisor' sit qui deprivat vita spirituali 
seu vita ex vero et bono {12}, n. 3607, 6767, 8902, et quod `filii' sint vera fidei, n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 2813, 3373, 3704, 4257, inde patet quid significatur per `Ephraim ad educendum ad 
occisorem filios suos'; quod `ubera' sint affectiones boni et veri, n. 6432, inde `ubera arentia' (o)sunt nullae affectiones sed loco earum cupiditates pervertendi; inde patet quid `vulva abortiens,' 
quod nempe sit perversio boni et veri; quod illa quae vitae spiritualis sunt per (d)omnia ea significentur, constat {13}, nam dicitur `propter malitiam operum expellam eum e domo Mea'; `e domo Jehovae' 
est ex Ecclesia et ex caelo, n. 2233, 2234, (x)3720, 5640: [5] apud Malachiam, 	Increpabo vobis absumentem ut non corrumpat vobis fructum terrae, neque abortiverit vobis vitis in agro; praedicabunt 
vos beatos omnes gentes, (o)et eritis vos terra beneplaciti, iii 11, 12; </p>
<p>quod non abortiret vitis in agro, significat {14} quod vera et bona fidei apud illos qui in Ecclesia suo ordine procedent, 
`vitis' enim est verum et bonum Ecclesiae spiritualis, n. 1069, 6375, 6376, 9277, et `ager' est Ecclesia, n. 2971, 3766, 7502, 9139, 9295; `terra beneplaciti' est Ecclesia Domino grata, nam unusquisque 
intra Ecclesiam qui regeneratus est per verum et bonum, est Ecclesia; inde patet quid sit (o)quod `eritis (x)terra beneplaciti'; quod `terra' sit Ecclesia, videatur supra: [6] apud Moschen, 	Si audiveritis 
judicia Mea, ut custodiatis et faciatis ea, benedictus eris prae omni populo {15}, non erit in te infecundus nec sterilis, et in bestia; removebit Jehovah a te omnem morbum, et omnes languores 
Aegypti malos, Deut. vii (x)12, 14, 15; </p>
<p>`non erit infecundus et sterilis' pro non absque vita ex vero et bono,ita quod erunt spiritualiter vivi: quia `sterilis' id significabat, ideo mulieres in antiquis 
Ecclesiis reputabant se non vivas cum steriles, prout Rachel, quae de se ita dixit ad Jacobum, 	{16} Vidit Rachel quod non pareret Jacobo; et dixit ad Jacobum, Da mihi filios, et si non, mortua 
ego, Gen. (x)xxx 1; n. 3908. 	[7] Per `steriles' etiam significantur qui non in bono sunt quia non in veris, et usque desiderant vera {17} ut in bono sint, prout gentes probae quae extra Ecclesiam, 
ut apud Esaiam, 	Canta, sterilis non (x)pepererat; persona cantu et jubila non parturivit, quia multi filii desolatae prae filiis maritatae, liv 1: </p>
<p>apud Davidem, 	Jehovah erigit ex pulvere attritum, 
e sterquilinio exaltat egenum, ad collocandum cum principibus populi Sui, Qui habitare facit sterilem domus, matrem filiorum laetam, Ps. (x)cxiii 7-9: </p>
<p>[8] in prophetico Channae postquam pepererat 
Samuelem, 	Saturi conducti sunt, et famelici cessarunt, usque dum sterilis peperit septem, multiprolis autem defecit, 1 Sam. ii 5; </p>
<p>in illis locis per `steriles' intelliguntur gentes quae arcessuntur 
ad Ecclesiam, et ad quas transfertur Ecclesia quando vetus (x)desiit, hoc est, quando illi qui prius ab Ecclesia fuerunt non amplius in fide sunt quia in nulla charitate; haec Ecclesia est quae intelligitur 
per `multiprolem quae defecit' et per `maritatam,' illa autem, nempe (o)nova gentium, per `sterilem et desolatam cui {18} erunt multi filii,' (o)et per `sterilem domus matrem filiorum laetam'; 
`parere septem' est regenerari ad plenum, nam `septem' ibi non significant septem sed ad plenum, n. 9228; ex his patet quid intelligitur per haec Domini verba, 	Venient dies in quibus dicent, Beatae 
steriles, et ventres qui non genuerunt, et ubera quae non lactarunt, Luc. xxiii 29; </p>
<p>agitur ibi de consummatione saeculi, quae est ultimum tempus Ecclesiae. 	[9] In Libro 2 Regum, 	Viri Jerichuntis 
dicebant ad Elisaeum, Ecce sedes urbis bona, at aquae malae et terra sterilis; tunc Elisaeus dixit ut (x)mitterent in paropside nova salem, et projicerent inde salem ad exitum aquarum; et sanatae aquae, 
nec venit amplius mors aut sterilitas, ii 19-21; </p>
<p>quid haec involvunt, nemo scire potest nisi ex sensu interno; omnia enim miracula quae in Verbo, involvunt talia quae in regno Domini seu in Ecclesia, 
n. 7337, 7465, 8364, 9086; quapropter sciendum est quid repraesentabat `Elisaeus,' quid significabat `urbs Jericho,' quid `aquae malae et terra sterilis,' quid `paropsis nova et sal in ea,' tum quid 
`exitus aquarum in quem projicerent salem'; quod `Elisaeus' repraesentaverit Dominum quoad Verbum, videatur n. 2762, quod `aquae' significent vera fidei, n. 28, 2702, 3058, 3424, 4976, 5668, (x)6346, 
7307, 8137, 8138, 8568; inde `aquae malae' (d)significant vera absque bono, et `terra sterilis' bonum Ecclesiae inde non vivum {19}, `paropsis nova' seu vas novum (o)scientifica et cognitiones boni 
et veri, n. 3068, 3079, 3316, 3318, `sal' desiderium veri ad bonum, n. 9207, `exitus aquarum' significat naturale hominis quod recipit cognitiones veri (o)et boni, et quod emendatur per desiderium veri 
ad bonum; [10] ex his patet quid miraculum illud involvebat, quod nempe emendationem Ecclesiae et vitae per Verbum a Domino, et per desiderium veri ad bonum inde; et quod emendatio fiat cum naturale 
hominis ex tali desiderio recipit vera {20} ex Verbo; quod hoc factum sit ad urbem Jericho, erat quia illa urbs non procul a Jordane sita est, et per `Jordanem' significatur id apud hominem Ecclesiae 
quod primum recipit vera, ita naturale, n. 1585, 4255; quod naturale (o)hominis sit primum quod recipit vera ex Verbo a Domino, et quod ultimo regeneratur, et quod cum id regeneratum est, totus homo 
regeneratus sit, significatum est per Domini verba ad Petrum cum lavit pedes discipulorum, 	Dixit Jesus, Qui lotus est non opus habet nisi ut quoad pedes lavetur, et mundus est totus, Joh. xiii 10; </p>
<p>quod 
`pedes' sint illa quae sunt naturalis hominis, in genere naturale, videatur n. 2162, 3147, 3761, 3986, (x)4280, 4938-4952, 5327, 5328.  Quod naturalis seu externus homo in correspondentia (t)debeat 
esse cum spirituali (m)seu interno ut homo regeneratus sit, ita quod {21} non prius regeneratus sit quam cum naturale regeneratum est, videatur n. 2850, 3167, 3286, 3321, 3470, 3493, 3508, 3509, 
3518, 3573, 3576, 3579, 3620, 3623, 3671, 3882, 3969, 4353, (x)4588, 4612, 4618, 5168, 5326, 5373, 5651, 6299, 6454, 7442, 7443, 8742-8747, 9043, 9046, 9061.(n) @1 i non$ @2 sit Ecclesia$ @3 dicitur$ @4
