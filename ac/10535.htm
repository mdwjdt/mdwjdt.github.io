<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10535节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10535</strong>.“百姓听见这凶信就悲哀”表他们悲伤是因为，他们没有占据超越他人的地位。这从“听见这凶信就悲哀”的含义清楚可知，“听见这凶信就悲哀”是指悲伤。它是指因为他们没有占据超越他人的地位而导致的悲伤，这一点从前面关于这个民族的说明清楚看出来，即：他们坚持让教会建在他们中间，但他们的这种坚持只是为了他们可以占据超越全世界所有民族的地位，因为他们比其它民族更陷入自我之爱，无法被提升到超越其它民族的地位，除非耶和华，因而教会与他们同在；因为耶和华，也就是主在哪里，教会就在哪里。这就是他们的目的，这一点从圣言中的许多经文，以及本章的这些话明显看出来：<br />摩西说，要在什么事上得以知道我和你的百姓在你眼中蒙恩呢？岂不是因你与我们同去，所以我和你的百姓才比地面上的所有人民都要尊贵？（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出33.16.htm">33:16</a>）<br />这不是因为他们被拣选，而是因为他们被允许拥有建在他们当中的教会；然而，住在这个民族本身里面的，不是一个教会，只是一个教会的代表（参看<a href="10396.htm">10396</a>e节提到的地方）。</p>

And the people heard this evil word, and they mourned. That this signifies their grief at not being pre-eminent to others, is evident from the signification of "hearing this evil word and mourning." 
That it denotes grief at not being pre-eminent to others, is plain from what has been already shown concerning that nation, namely, that they were insistent that a church should be instituted among them, 
but merely in order that they might be pre-eminent to all the nations in the whole world; for they were in the love of self more than other nations, and they could not be raised to eminence above 
them in any other way than by Jehovah being with them, thus also the church, for where Jehovah is, that is, the Lord, there is the church. That this was their end is evident from many passages in the 
Word, as also from these words in this chapter: </p>
<p>     Moses said, And wherein shall it ever be known that I have found grace in Thine eyes, I and Thy people? Is it not in Thy going with us? so that we 
be rendered pre-eminent, I and Thy people, above all the people that are upon the faces of the earth? (Exod. 33:16.) (That it was not by choice, but by permission, that a church was instituted among 
them, and yet that in the nation itself there was not a church, but only the representative of a church, see the places cited in n. 10396.) </p>

'And the people heard this bad news, and mourned' means their grief because they do not occupy a position above others. This is clear from the meaning of 'hearing this bad news and mourning' as grief. 
The fact that it is grief because they do not occupy a position above others is evident from what has been shown previously regarding that nation. That is to say, it has been shown that they insisted 
on the Church's being established among themselves. But they insisted on this with no other end in view than that they might occupy a position above all nations throughout the entire world; for they 
were ruled by self-love more than others were, and could not be raised to a position above those nations unless Jehovah, and therefore also the Church, was with them; for where Jehovah - that is, the 
Lord - is, so is the Church. That such was their end in view is clear from a large number of places in the Word, and also from the following verse in the present chapter,  </p>
<blockquote>
Moses said, How will it 
ever be made known that I have found grace in Your eyes, I and Your people? Will it not be in Your going with us? And I and Your people will be made more distinguished than all the people who are on the 
face of the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2033:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 33:16</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>It was not because they were chosen, rather because they were allowed to have the Church established among them; yet the Church did not reside within the actual 
nation, only that which was representative of the Church did so, see in the places referred to in <a href="10396.htm">10396</a>(end).  </p>

`Et audivit populus verbum malum hoc, et luxerunt':  quod significet dolorem eorum ob non eminentiam super alios, constat ex significatione `audire verbum malum hoc et lugere'; {1} quod sit dolor ob 
non eminentiam super alios, patet ex illis quae prius de illa gente ostensa sunt, quod nempe institerint quod apud illos (d)Ecclesia instituenda esset, sed hoc (t)ob non alium finem quam ut eminerent 
supra omnes gentes in universo terrarum orbe, nam in amore sui fuerunt prae illis, et ad eminentiam super illas non per aliud extolli potuerunt quam ut apud illos esset Jehovah, ita quoque Ecclesia, 
nam ubi Jehovah, hoc est, Dominus, ibi Ecclesia.  Quod hic finis fuerit, constat a pluribus locis in Verbo, ut quoque ab his in hoc capite, 	Dixit Moscheh, In quo notum fiet usquam quod invenerim gratiam 
in oculis Tuis ego et populus Tuus, nonne in eundo Te cum nobis?  et praestantes reddemur ego et populus Tuus prae omni populo qui super faciebus terrae, vers. 16; </p>
<p>quod non electio fuerit, sed permissio 
quod Ecclesia apud illos instituta fuerit, sed quod usque in ipsa gente (t)Ecclesia non fuerit, {2}verum modo repraesentativum Ecclesiae, videatur in locis citatis n. 10396 fin. @1 quod sit
