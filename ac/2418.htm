<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2418节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2418.</strong>“也不可在全平原站住”表不要停留在这些教义的任何一个上。这从“平原”的含义清楚可知，“平原”是指稍后所论述的教义性质的方方面面。至于不要停留在这些教义的任何一个上是怎么回事，这会在26节予以阐明，那里提到了罗得的妻子，因为她在罗得后边回头看。在圣言中，“平原”表教义性质的方方面面，这一点明显可见于耶利米书：<br />行毁灭的必来到各城，并无一城幸免。山谷必败落，平原必被毁坏。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶48.8.htm">48:8</a>）<br />此处“城”表虚假的教义，“平原”表该教义的方方面面。启示录：<br />那一千年完了，撒但必从监牢里被释放，出来要迷惑地上列族，就是歌革和玛各，叫他们聚集争战。他们的人数多如海沙。他们上来遍满了全地的平原，围住圣徒的营，就有火由神那里从天降下，烧灭了他们。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.7.htm">20:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.9.htm">9</a>）<br />此处“歌革和玛各”表那些其敬拜是缺乏内在的外在敬拜，因而变成偶像崇拜的人（<a href="1151.htm">1151</a>节）；“全地的平原”表他们已荒废的教会教义；“圣徒的营”表爱与仁之善；他们被“由神那里从天降下的火烧灭了”与24节论及所多玛和蛾摩拉人的话意思一样。还有，在耶利米书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶33.13.htm">33:13</a>）中，仁爱的教义被称为“山地的城邑”，信的教义则被称为“平原的城邑”。</p>

Stay not in all the plain. That this signifies that he should not linger in any of these doctrinal matters, is evident from the signification of a "plain," as being everything of a doctrinal nature, 
concerning which presently. How the case stands with his not lingering in any of these doctrinal matters shall be stated at verse 26, where Lot's wife is treated of in that she looked back behind him. 
That in the Word a "plain" signifies all things of a doctrinal nature, is evident in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     He that layeth waste shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape, and the valley shall perish, 
and the plain shall be destroyed (Jer. 48:8); </p>
<p>where "city" denotes false doctrine; and the "plain" all things that belong to that doctrine. In John: </p>
<p>     When the thousand years are finished, 
Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, and shall go forth to seduce the nations, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to war, the number of whom is as the sand of the sea; and they went up upon all 
the plain of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and fire came down from God out of heaven, and consumed them (Rev. 20:7-9); </p>
<p>where "Gog and Magog" denote those who are in external 
worship without internal, thus worship become idolatrous (n. 1151); the "plain of the earth," the doctrinal things of the church, which they lay waste; the "camp of the saints," the goods of love and 
of charity; their being "consumed by fire from God out of heaven" means the same as when this is said of the men of Sodom and Gomorrah, in verse 24. Again: the doctrinal things of charity are called 
the "cities of the mountain," and the doctrinal things of faith the "cities of the plain," in Jeremiah 33:13. </p>

'Do not halt in all the plain' means he was not to linger over any one of these. This is clear from the meaning of 'a plain' as every aspect of doctrine, dealt with immediately below. What not lingering 
over any one of them entails will be stated at verse 26, where Lot's wife is referred to as looking back behind him. That 'a plain' in the Word means all aspects of that doctrine is clear in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
He 
who lays waste will come to every city, and no city will escape; and the valley will perish, and the plain will be destroyed. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2048:%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 48: 8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'City' stands for false doctrinal teaching, 'the 
plain' for all aspects of that doctrine. In John, </p>
<blockquote>
When the thousand years have come to an end Satan will be loosed from his prison, and will come out to deceive the nations which are at the four corners 
of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle; their number is like the sand of the sea. They went up therefore over the whole plain of the earth, and surrounded the camp of the saints; 
but fire came down from God out of heaven and consumed them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2020:%207-9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 20: 7-9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'Gog and Magog' stands for people whose worship was external devoid of internal and so had become idolatrous, <a href="1151.htm">1151</a>. 
'The plain of the earth' stands for the Church's matters of doctrine which they lay waste, 'the camp of the saints' for goods that flow from love and charity. 'Consumed by fire from God out of heaven' 
is similar in meaning to that regarding the men of Sodom and Gomorrah, in verse 24. Also in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jeremiah%2033:%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jeremiah 33: 13</a> matters of doctrine regarding charity are called 'cities of the mountain' and matters of doctrine 
regarding faith 'cities of the plain'. </p>

Quod `ne consistas in omni planitie' significet quod non in ullo eorum moraretur, constat a significatione `planitiei' quod sit omne doctrinalis, de qua mox: quomodo se habet quod non moraretur in ullo 
eorum, dicetur ad vers. 26, ubi de uxore Loti, quod respexerit post eum.  Quod `planities' in Verbo significet omnia doctrinalis, constat apud Jeremiam, 	Veniet vastator ad omnem urbem, et urbs non 
evadet, et peribit vallis, et perdetur planities, xlviii 8; </p>
<p>`urbs' pro doctrinali falso, `planities' pro omnibus quae sunt istius doctrinalis: apud Johannem, 	Quando consummati {1} fuerint mille 
anni, solvetur Satanas e custodia sua, et exibit ad seducendum gentes [quae in quatuor angulis terrae', Gogum et Magogum, ut congreget eos in bellum, quorum numerus sicut arena maris; ascenderunt itaque 
super omnem planitiem terrae, et circumdederant castra sanctorum, sed descendit ignis a Deo e caelo, et consumpsit eos, Apoc. xx 7-9; </p>
<p>ubi `Gogus et Magogus' pro iis qui in cultu externo absque {2} 
interno, sic facto idololatrico, n.  1151; `planities terrae' pro Ecclesiae doctrinalibus quae illi vastant {3}, `castra sanctorum' pro bonis (o)amoris et charitatis; `consumpti igne a Deo e caelo' similiter 
se habet ac cum viris `Sodomae et Amorae,' vers. 24: praeterea doctrinalia charitatis vocantur `urbes montis,' et doctrinalia fidei `urbes planitiei,' apud Jeremiam xxxiii 13. 	@1 consumti I.$ 	@2 
separato ab.$ 	@3 vastabunt.$ </p>
