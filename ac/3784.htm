<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3784节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3784.</strong>创世记29:7，8.雅各说，看哪，日头还高，不是牲畜聚集的时候，你们不如饮羊，去放牧吧。他们说，我们不能，必等羊群聚齐，他们把石头从井口滚开，我们才可饮羊。<br />“雅各说，看哪，日头还高”表现在状态正在发展。“不是牲畜聚集的时候”表教会和教义事物的良善和真理尚不能集为一体。“你们不如饮羊，去放牧吧”表由此而来的教导还是要被赋予少数人。“我们不能，必等羊群聚齐”表它们当在一起。“他们把石头从井口滚开”表圣言的事物以这种方式被披露。“我们才可饮羊”表那时他们就会接受教导。</p>

Verses 7, 8. And he said, Behold as yet the day is great, it is not time for the cattle to be gathered together: water ye the flock, and go and feed them. And they said, We cannot until all the droves 
are gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then shall we water the flock. "And he said, Behold as yet the day is great," signifies that now the state was advancing; "it is 
not time for the cattle to be gathered together," signifies that the goods and truths of the churches and of doctrinal things could not as yet be gathered into a one; "water ye the flock and go and feed 
them," signifies instruction therefrom to a few; "and they said, We cannot until all the droves are gathered together," signifies that they ought to be together; "and they roll the stone from the 
well's mouth," signifies that thus the things of the Word are disclosed; "then shall we water the flock," signifies that then they are instructed. </p>

Verses 7, 8 And he said, Behold, it is still high day; it is not time for the cattle to be gathered together; water the flock, and go and pasture them. And they said, We cannot until all the droves are 
gathered together, and they have rolled the stone from over the mouth of the well, and we water the flock. </p>
<p>'He said, Behold, it is still high day' means that the state was now in progress. 'It is 
not time for the cattle to be gathered together' means that goods and truths constituting the Churches and their matters of doctrine were not yet gathered into one. 'Water the flock, and go and pasture 
them' means instruction from these was nevertheless to be given to a few. 'And they said, We cannot until all the droves are gathered together' means that they ought to be all together. 'And they 
have rolled the stone from over the mouth of the well' means that in this way things of the Word are disclosed. 'And we water the flock' means that at that point they receive instruction. </p>

Vers. 7, 8.  Et dixit, Ecce adhuc dies magnus, non tempus colligi pecudes {1}, potate gregem, et ite, pascite.  Et dixerunt, Non possumus usque quod colligantur omnes catervae, et devolvant lapidem 
a super ore putei, et potabimus gregem.  `Dixit, Ecce adhuc dies magnus' significat quod nunc status procedens: `non tempus colligi pecudes {2} significat quod nondum in unum bona et vera Ecclesiarum 
et doctrinalium: `potate gregem, et ite, pascite' significat usque instructionem inde paucis: `et dixerunt, Non possumus usque quodque colligantur omnes catervae' significat quod simul esse debeant: 
 `et devolvant lapidem a super ore putei' significat quod sic retegantur illa quae sunt Verbi: `et potabimus gregem' significat quod tunc instruantur. @1 singular A$ @2 pecudem AI$ </p>
