<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7450.</strong>出埃及记8:21-28.法老召了摩西、亚伦来，说，你们去，在这地祭祀你们的神吧！摩西说，这样行本不相宜，因为我们要把埃及人所厌恶的祭祀耶和华我们的神；看哪，若把埃及人所厌恶的，在他们眼前献为祭，他们岂不拿石头打死我们吗？我们要走三天的路程进到旷野，照着祂所吩咐我们的祭祀耶和华我们的神。法老说，我容你们去，在旷野祭祀耶和华你们的神，只是不要走得很远，求你们为我祈祷。摩西说，看哪，我要从你这里出去，祈求耶和华，使讨厌的苍蝇明天离开法老和法老的臣仆并法老的百姓；只是法老却不可再行愚弄，不容百姓去祭祀耶和华。于是摩西从法老那里出来，去祈求耶和华。耶和华就照摩西的话行，叫讨厌的苍蝇离开法老和他的臣仆并他的百姓，一个也没有留下。这一次法老又使他的心发沉，不容百姓去。<br />“法老召了摩西、亚伦来”表神之律法的出现。“说，你们去，在这地祭祀你们的神吧”表他们不会反对他们敬拜他们的神，但他们必须在附近的地方如此行。“摩西说”表回答。“这样行本不相宜，因为我们要把埃及人所厌恶的祭祀耶和华我们的神”表地狱的肮脏和污秽会流入。“看哪，若把埃及人所厌恶的，在他们眼前献为祭”表如果当着他们的面祭献，神性敬拜将被这类事物侵扰。“他们岂不拿石头打死我们吗”表他们将由此拆毁与敬拜有关的信之真理。“我们要走三天的路程进到旷野”表他们要完全离开，以便处于自由之中。“祭祀耶和华我们的神”表以这种方式才会有敬拜。“照着祂所吩咐我们的”表照着祂所吩咐的。“法老说，我容你们去，在旷野祭祀耶和华你们的神”表他们将离开或释放他们，不侵扰他们，好叫他们可以在自由中敬拜他们的神。“只是不要走得很远”表尽管他们就在附近。“求你们为我祈祷”表他们要代求。“摩西说，看哪，我要从你这里出去”表神的真理在他们当中的显现的移除。“祈求耶和华”表代求。“使讨厌的苍蝇离开法老和法老的臣仆并法老的百姓”表好叫涉及恶毒虚假的这种状态能有一个结束。“明天”表永远。“只是法老却不可再行愚弄，不容百姓去祭祀耶和华”表只要他不以谎言进行欺骗，离开他们，好叫他们在自由中敬拜他们的神。“于是摩西从法老那里出来”表神的真理在那些沉浸于恶毒虚假之人当中的显现的移除。“去祈求耶和华”表代求。“耶和华就照摩西的话行”表这是照着主的话而如此行的。“叫讨厌的苍蝇离开法老和他的臣仆并他的百姓”表虚假的这种状态的结束。“一个也没有留下”表一种完全移除。“这一次法老又使他的心发沉”表再一次的固执。“不容百姓去”表他们不会离开那些属于属灵教会的人。</p>

Verses 21-28. And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land. And Moses said, It is not meet to do so, for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians 
to Jehovah our God; lo, we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians unto their eyes, and will they not stone us? We will go a way of three days into the wilderness, and will sacrifice to Jehovah 
our God, as He hath said unto us. And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, and ye shall sacrifice to Jehovah your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: supplicate for me. And Moses 
said, Behold, I go forth from thee, and I will supplicate unto Jehovah that He may remove the noisome fly from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow; only let not Pharaoh mock any 
more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to Jehovah. And Moses went out from before Pharaoh, and he supplicated unto Jehovah. And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; and He removed the 
noisome fly from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there was not one left. And Pharaoh made heavy his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go. "And Pharaoh called Moses and 
Aaron" signifies the presence of the law Divine; "and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land," signifies that they would not oppose their worshiping their God, but it must be done in their 
neighborhood; "and Moses said," signifies the answer; "it is not meet to do so, for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Jehovah our God," signifies that infernal foulness and filthiness 
would flow in; "lo, we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes," signifies that Divine worship would be infested by such if done in their presence; "and will they not stone 
us?" signifies that thus they would extinguish the truths of faith which are of worship; "we will go a way of three days into the wilderness," signifies that they would utterly depart so as to be 
in freedom; "and will sacrifice to Jehovah our God," signifies that in this way there would be worship; "as He hath said unto us," signifies as He has commanded; "and Pharaoh said, I will let you go, 
and ye shall sacrifice to Jehovah your God in the wilderness," signifies that they would leave them, and not infest them, so that they may worship their God in freedom; "only ye shall not go very far 
away," signifies although they are in the neighborhood; "supplicate for me," signifies that they should intercede; "and Moses said, Behold, I go forth from thee," signifies the removal of the appearance 
of truth Divine among them; "and I will supplicate unto Jehovah," signifies intercession; "that He may remove the noisome fly from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people" signifies that there 
may be an end of this state in respect to the falsities of malevolence; "tomorrow," signifies forever; "only let not Pharaoh mock anymore in not letting the people go to sacrifice to Jehovah," signifies 
provided he does not deceive by a lie, and does not [fail to] leave them to worship their God in freedom; "and Moses went out from Pharaoh" signifies the removal of the appearance of truth Divine 
among those who are in falsities of malevolence; "and he supplicated unto Jehovah," signifies intercession; "and Jehovah did according to the word of Moses," signifies that it was so done according 
to the word of the Lord; "and he removed the noisome fly from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people," signifies the end of this state of falsity; "there was not one left," signifies a full 
removal; "and Pharaoh made heavy his heart this time also," signifies obstinacy again; "and he did not let the people go," signifies that they would not leave those who were of the spiritual church. </p>

Verses 21-28 And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said, Go, sacrifice to your God in the land. And Moses said, It is ill-advised to do so, for we would be sacrificing the abomination of the Egyptians 
to Jehovah our God. Behold, should we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, will they not stone us? We will go a way of three days<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Jehovah 
our God, as He has said to us. And Pharaoh said, I will send you away to sacrifice to Jehovah your God in the wilderness; only you must certainly not go far away. Plead for me. And Moses said, Behold, 
I go out from you, and I will plead with Jehovah to remove the noxious flying insects from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow; only do not let Pharaoh act deceitfully again 
in not sending the people away to sacrifice to Jehovah. And Moses went out from Pharaoh and pleaded with Jehovah. And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; and He removed the noxious flying insects 
from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. Not one was left. And Pharaoh made his heart stubborn this time also, and did not send the people away.  </p>
<p>'And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron' 
means the presence of the law of God. 'And said, Go, sacrifice to your God in the land' means that they would not stand in the way of their worshipping their God, provided that they did so in a 
place near them. 'And Moses said' means the reply. 'It is ill-advised to do so, for we would be sacrificing the abomination of the Egyptians to Jehovah our God' means that what was vile, foul, and hellish 
would enter in. 'Behold, should we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes' means that if offered in their presence Divine worship would be molested by such things. 'Will they 
not stone us?' means that they would thereby demolish the truths of faith that related to worship. 'We will go a way of three days into the wilderness' means that they would remove themselves altogether, 
so as to be in freedom. 'And sacrifice to Jehovah our God' means that then there would be worship. 'As He has said to us' means as He had commanded. 'And Pharaoh said, I will send you away to sacrifice 
to Jehovah your God in the wilderness' means that they would leave them and not molest them, in order that they might worship their God in freedom. 'Only you must certainly not go far away' means 
although they would remain nearby. 'Plead for me means that they should intercede. 'And Moses said, Behold, I go out from you ' means the removal of the appearance of God's truth among them. 'And 
I will plead with Jehovah' means intercession. 'To remove the noxious flying insects from Pharaoh, from his servants, [and] from his people' means in order that there may be an end to that state involving 
the malevolent falsities. 'Tomorrow' means for evermore. 'Only do not let Pharaoh act deceitfully again in not sending the people away to sacrifice to Jehovah' means provided that he does not deceive 
with lies and fail to leave, so that they may worship their God in freedom. 'And Moses went out from Pharaoh' means the removal of the appearance of God's truth among those steeped in malevolent 
falsities. 'And pleaded with Jehovah' means intercession. 'And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses' means that it was so done according to the Lord's word. 'And He removed the noxious flying insects 
from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people' means the end of this state of falsity. 'Not one was left' means a complete removal. 'And Pharaoh made his heart stubborn this time also' means 
obstinacy once again. 'And did not send the people away' means that they did not leave those who belonged to the spiritual Church.

(x)  Vers. 21-28.  Et vocavit Pharao Moschen et Aharonem, et dixit, Ite, sacrificate Deo vestro in terra.  Et dixit Moscheh, Non consultum facere ita, quia abominationem Aegyptiorum sacrificaremus Jehovae 
Deo nostro; ecce sacrificaremus abominationem Aegyptiorum ad oculos illorum, nonne lapidabunt nos?  Viam trium dierum ibimus in desertum, et sacrificabimus Jehovae Deo nostro, quemadmodum dixit ad 
nos.  Et dixit Pharao, Ego dimittam vos, et sacrificetis Jehovae Deo vestro in deserto, tantum elongando non elongetis vos ad (x)eundum; supplicate pro me.  Et dixit Moscheh, Ecce [ego] egredior a cum 
te, et supplicabo ad Jehovam, (x)et removeat volatile noxium a Pharaone, a servis illius, et a populo illius, cras; tantum ne addat Pharao illudere, quo minus dimittat populum ad sacrificandum Jehovae. 
 Et egressus Moscheh a cum Pharaone, et supplicavit ad Jehovam.  Et fecit Jehovah secundum verbum Moschis, et removit volatile noxium a Pharaone, a servis illius, et a populo illius; non relictum 
unum.  Et aggravavit Pharao cor suum etiam vice hac, et non dimisit populum.  `Et vocavit Pharao Moschen et Aharonem' significat praesentiam legis Divinae: `et dixit, Ite, sacrificate Deo vestro in terra' 
significat quod non obstarent quin colant Deum suum, sed in propinquitate apud illos: `et dixit Moscheh' significat responsum: `Non consultum facere ita, quia abominationem Aegyptiorum sacrificaremus 
Jehovae Deo nostro' significat quod influeret taetrum et spurcum infernale: `ecce sacrificaremus abominationem Aegyptiorum ad oculos illorum' significat quod si in praesentia illorum, cultus Divinus 
talibus infestaretur: `nonne lapidabunt nos?' significat quod sic vera fidei, quae cultus, exstinguerent: `viam trium dierum ibimus in desertum' significat quod prorsus elongarent se ut in libero 
sint: `et sacrificabimus Jehovae Deo nostro' significat quod sic cultus: `quemadmodum dixit ad nos' significat prout praeceperat: `et dixit Pharao, Ego dimittam vos, et sacrificetis Jehovae Deo vestro 
in deserto' significat quod relinquerent illos, et non infestarent, ut colant Deum suum in libero: `tantum elongando non elongetis vos ad eundum' significat tametsi in propinquitate sint: `supplicate 
pro me' significat ut intercedant: `et dixit Moscheh, Ecce ego egredior a cum te' significat remotionem apparentiae veri Divini apud illos: `et supplicabo ad Jehovam' significat intercessionem: `et 
removeat volatile noxium a Pharaone, a servis illius, a populo illius' significat ut finis sit illius status quoad falsa malevolentiae: `cras' significat in perpetuum: tantum ne addat Pharao {1}illudere, 
quo minus dimittat populum ad sacrificandum Jehovae' significat modo ne per mendacium fallat, et non relinquat ut in libero colant Deum suum: `et egressus Moscheh a cum Pharaone' significat remotionem 
apparentiae veri Divini apud illos qui in falsis malevolentiae: `et supplicavit ad Jehovam' significat intercessionem: {2} `et fecit Jehovah secundum verbum Moschis' significat quod ita factum secundum 
verbum Domini: `et removit volatile noxium a Pharaone, a servis illius, et a populo illius' significat status hujus falsi finem: `non relictum unum' significat remotionem plenam: et aggravavit 
Pharao cor suum etiam vice hac' significat obstinationem iterum: `et non dimisit populum' significat quod non relinquerent illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali. 	@1 eludere I$ 	@2 7406 written in m of this v$ </p>
