<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4289节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4289.</strong>“天黎明了，容我去吧”表示在雅各的后代进入迦南地的代表之前，纯正的代表角色将离开他们。这从内在历史意义上的思路清楚看出来，这层意义论述的是雅各的后代。就教会的事物而言，他们的状态在圣言中也被描述为晚上、黑夜、早晨或黎明，当他们进入迦南地时，就被描述为黎明，因而进入那地的教会代表。其中的情形是这样：在他们彻底荒废，也就是对内在事物一无所知之前，教会的代表无法在他们当中建立。他们若对内在事物有所了解，就有可能对它们拥有一种情感，从而亵渎它们。因为能亵渎神圣事物，也就是内在真理与良善的，是那些知道并承认它们的人，尤其是那些对它们拥有一种情感的人，而不是那些不承认它们的人。可参看前面关于亵渎的阐述和说明，即：能亵渎神圣事物的，是那些知道并承认它们的人，而不是那些不知道并承认它们的人（<a href="593.htm">593</a>，<a href="1008.htm">1008</a>，<a href="1010.htm">1010</a>，<a href="1059.htm">1059</a>，<a href="3398.htm">3398</a>，<a href="3898.htm">3898</a>节）；教会之内的人能亵渎神圣事物，教会之外的人则不能（<a href="2051.htm">2051</a>节）；因此，凡不能长久持守在良善与真理中的人都尽可能远离对它们的承认和信仰（<a href="3398.htm">3398</a>，<a href="3402.htm">3402</a>节）；他们被保守在无知当中，是为了防止他们亵渎（<a href="301.htm">301</a>-<a href="303.htm">303</a>节）；亵渎圣物会有什么样的危险（<a href="571.htm">571</a>，<a href="582.htm">582</a>节）；敬拜变得外在，是为了防止内在之物遭到亵渎（<a href="1327.htm">1327</a>，<a href="1328.htm">1328</a>节）；因此，内在真理没有透露给犹太人（<a href="3398.htm">3398</a>节）。<br />所以，主规定，纯正的教会代表，也就是教会的任何内在代表，在雅各的后代进入迦南地的代表之前，要远离他们，好让他们对于主的事一无所知。诚然，他们知道弥赛亚要降世，可他们以为祂降世是为了把他们提升到胜过全世界所有民族的荣耀和优越中，而不是永远拯救他们的灵魂。他们也不知道有关天国、死后生命，甚至仁与信的任何事。为了让他们变得如此无知，他们在埃及被关了好几个世纪；当从那里被召唤出来时，他们甚至不知道耶和华这个名（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出3.12.htm">3:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出3.14.htm">14</a>）。而且，他们已经失去了代表教会的一切敬拜，以致十诫从西乃山当着他们的面颁布之后，他们不到一个月就回到埃及敬拜，也就是对金牛犊的崇拜（出埃及记32章）。<br />由于从埃及被带出来的这个民族具有这样的性质，所以他们都死在了旷野。事实上，对他们的要求只是在外在形式上持守典章和律例，因为在外在形式上持守这些就是在扮演教会代表的角色。然而，那些在埃及长大的人无法适应这一角色，但他们的孩子却能，尽管有困难，一开始要利用神迹，后来利用恐惧和被掳，这从约书亚记和士师记明显看出来。由此明显可知，所有纯正或内在的教会代表在他们进入迦南地，也就是教会的外在代表以完全的形式在他们中间开始所在的地方之前，都要远离他们。迦南地是教会的代表能被引入所在的实际之地，因为这地的所有地方和所有边界自古以来就是代表（参看<a href="3686.htm">3686</a>节）。</p>

That by "Let me go, for the dawn ariseth," is signified that what is representative would depart from the posterity of Jacob, before they came into the representatives of the land of Canaan, is evident 
from the series of things in the internal historical sense, in which Jacob's posterity are treated of. Their state in respect to the things of the church is also described in the Word by evening, by 
night, and by morning or dawn - by the latter when they came into the land of Canaan, consequently into the representative of a church there. The case herein is that the representative of a church could 
not be instituted among them until they had been altogether vastated, that is, until they had no knowledge of internal things; for if they had had a knowledge of internal things they could have been 
affected by them, and thus would have profaned them. For holy things (that is, internal truths and goods) can be profaned by those who know and acknowledge them, and still more by those who are affected 
by them, but not by those who do not acknowledge them. But see what has been previously said and shown about profanation, namely: That those can profane holy things who know and acknowledge them, 
but not those who do not (n. 593, 1008, 1010, 1059, 3398, 3898): That those who are within the church can profane holy things, but not those who are without (n. 2051): That therefore so far as is possible 
those are withheld from the acknowledgment and belief of good and truth who cannot remain therein permanently (n. 3398, 3402): That these are also kept in ignorance lest they should profane (n. 
301-303): What danger there is from the profanation of holy things (n. 571, 582): That worship becomes external lest what is internal should be profaned (n. 1327, 1328): And that therefore internal 
truths were not disclosed to the Jews (n. 3398).  [2] It was therefore provided by the Lord that the genuine representative of a church (that is, what is internal) should depart from the posterity of 
Jacob before they came into the representatives of the land of Canaan, insomuch that they did not know anything at all concerning the Lord. They did indeed know that the Messiah was to come into the 
world, but to the end that He should exalt them to glory and eminence over all nations of the whole earth - not to save their souls to eternity. Neither did they know anything about the heavenly kingdom, 
nor about the life after death, and not even about charity and faith. In order that they might be reduced to this ignorance they were kept some hundreds of years in Egypt; and when they were called 
out thence, they did not know even the name of Jehovah (Exod. 3:12-14). Moreover, they had lost all the worship of the representative church, insomuch that after the commandments of the Decalogue had 
been promulgated before them from Mount Sinai, within a month they fell back to the Egyptian worship, which was that of a golden calf (Exod. 32). [3] And because the brood that had been brought out 
of Egypt was of such a character, they all perished in the wilderness. For nothing more was required of them than to keep the statutes and precepts in the outward form, because this was to act as the 
representative of a church; but those who had grown up in Egypt could not be reduced to this; yet their children could, although with difficulty, in the beginning by miracles, and afterwards by fears 
and captivities, as is manifest from the books of Joshua and Judges. From this it is evident that all genuine or internal representation of the church had departed from them before they came into the 
land of Canaan, where the external representative of the church was begun among them in full form. For the land of Canaan was the veriest land of all where the representatives of the church could be 
presented, because all the places and all the boundaries of this land had been representative from ancient times (see n. 3686). </p>

'Let me go, for the dawn is coming up' means that the genuine representative role would depart from the descendants of Jacob before they entered into the representatives connected with the land of Canaan. 
This becomes clear from the train of thought in the internal historical sense in which the descendants of Jacob are the subject. Their state in regard to things of the Church is also described in 
the Word as evening, night, and morning or dawn - dawn being used to describe the time when they entered the land of Canaan and as a consequence into that which was a representative of the Church in 
that land. The implications of this are as follows: A representative of the Church could not be established among them until they had been completely vastated, that is, until no knowledge of internal 
things existed with them. For if knowledge of internal things had existed with them it would have been possible for them to have an affection for them, in which case they would have profaned them For 
the ability to profane holy things, that is, internal truths and goods, exists with those who know and acknowledge them, more so with those who have an affection for them, but not with those who do not 
acknowledge them. But see what has been stated and shown already about profanation: </p>
<p> People who know and acknowledge holy things are able to profane them, but not those who do not know and acknowledge 
them, <a href="593.htm">593</a>, <a href="1008.htm">1008</a>, <a href="1010.htm">1010</a>, <a href="1059.htm">1059</a>, <a href="3398.htm">3398</a>, <a href="3898.htm">3898</a>. </p>
<p>People inside the Church are capable of profaning holy things, but not those outside, <a href="2051.htm">2051</a>. </p>
<p>Therefore all who are unable to remain steadfast in goodness 
and truth are kept as far as possible from an acknowledgement of and faith in them, <a href="3398.htm">3398</a>, <a href="3402.htm">3402</a>; and they are kept in ignorance to prevent their profanation of them, <a href="301.htm">301</a>-<a href="303.htm">303</a>. </p>
<p>What danger comes 
from profaning holy things, <a href="571.htm">571</a>, <a href="582.htm">582</a>. </p>
<p>Worship becomes external to prevent what is internal being profaned, <a href="1327.htm">1327</a>, <a href="1328.htm">1328</a>. Therefore internal truths were not disclosed to the Jews, <a href="3398.htm">3398</a>. </p>

 The Lord 
therefore made provision so that anything genuinely representative of the Church, that is, any internal representation of it, would have departed from the descendants of Jacob before they entered 
into the representatives connected with the land of Canaan. It so departed that they did not know anything at all about the Lord. They knew, it is true, that the Messiah was to come into the world, but 
they supposed that the reason for His coming would be to promote them to glory and pre-eminence over all nations in the whole world, but not that He would save their souls for ever. Neither indeed did 
they know anything whatever about the heavenly kingdom, nor anything about the life after death, nor even anything about charity and faith. To reduce them to such ignorance they were kept for several 
centuries in Egypt, and when summoned from there did not even know the actual name Jehovah, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%203:12-14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 3:12-14</a>. What is more, they had lost all the worship of the representative Church, so much so that 
a month after the Ten Commandments had been publicly declared in their presence from mount Sinai they reverted to Egyptian worship, which was that of the golden calf, Exod. <a href="32.htm">32</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 And this being the 
nature of the nation which had been brought out of Egypt they all died in the wilderness. For nothing more was required of them than to keep ordinances and commands in the outward form these took, 
because to keep these in their outward form was to play the part of a representative of the Church. Those who had grown up in Egypt however could not be fitted for that part, but their children could, 
though with difficulty, at first by means of miracles and after that by terrors and captivities, as is evident from the Books of Joshua and Judges. From this it becomes clear that the entire genuine 
or internal representative of the Church had departed from them before they entered the land of Canaan where the full form of an external representative of the Church was begun among them; for the land 
of Canaan was the actual land where the representatives of the Church could be introduced. For all the places and all the boundaries had, since ancient times, been representative in that land, see <a href="3686.htm">3686</a>. </p>

Quod per `mitte me quia ascendit aurora' significetur quod repraesentativum antequam venirent in terrae Canaanis repraesentativa, a Jacobi posteris discederet, constare potest ex serie rerum in sensu 
interno historico, in quo de Jacobi posteris agitur; status eorum quoad illa quae sunt Ecclesiae, in Verbo etiam describitur per `vesperam,' per `noctem,' et per `mane' seu auroram, et per hanc, 
eum venerunt in terram Canaanem, proinde in repraesentativum Ecclesiae ibi.  Cum his ita se habet: </p>
<p>repraesentativum Ecclesiae apud illos non prius institui potuit quam cum prorsus vastati essent, 
hoc est, cum nulla illis cognitio internorum, si enim illis cognitio internorum fuisset, potuissent affici illis, et sic profanavissent illa; profanari enim possunt sancta, hoc est, vera et bona 
interna, ab iis qui sciunt et agnoscunt illa, et magis ab iis qui afficiuntur illis, non autem ab iis qui non agnoscunt; sed videantur quae de profanatione prius dicta et ostensa sunt, nempe quod profanare 
queant sancta qui sciunt et agnoscunt illa, non autem qui non sciunt et agnoscunt, n. 593, 1008, 1010, 1059, 3398, 3898: quod qui intra Ecclesiam, profanare possint sancta, non autem qua extra, 
n. 2051: quod ideo detineantur quantum possibile ab agnitione et fide boni et veri qui non permanere in illis possunt n. 3398, 3402 quodque teneantur in ignorantia ne profanent, n. 301-303 quid 
periculi a profanatione sanctorum, n. 571, 582: quod cultus fiat externus ne profanetur internum, n. 1327, 1328: quod ideo Judaeis non detecta fuerint vera interna, n. 3398. [2] Ideo provisum fuit 
a Domino ut genuinum repraesentativum Ecclesiae hoc est, internum, discederet a Jacobi posteris antequam venirent in terrae Canaanis repraesentativa; </p>
<p>usque adeo ut prorsus non sciverint aliquid 
de Domino, quidem quod Messias venturus {1} in mundum sed ob finem ut eveheret illos ad gloriam et eminentiam super omne gentes totius terrae, non autem ut salvaret animas illorum in aeternum immo 
nec quicquam sciverunt de regno caelesti, nec de vita post mortem, ne quidem de charitate et fide: ut in ignorantiam illam redigerentur, tenebantur per aliquot centum annos in Aegypto, e cum inde evocarentur, 
nesciverant ipsum nomen Jehovae,{2} Exod iii 12-14; et praeterea perdiderunt omnem cultum Ecclesiae repraesentativae, usque adeo ut postquam praecepta decalogi coram illi promulgata fuissent 
e monte Sinai, post mensem dierum ad cultum Aegyptiacum qui fuit vituli aurei, recurrerent, Exod. xxxii; [3] et quia talis erat gens illa quae educta erat ex Aegypto, ideo omnes in deserto perierunt, 
non enim amplius ab illis requirebatur quam ut statuta e praecepta in externa forma custodirent, nam id erat agere repraesentativum Ecclesiae, sed ad (c)id non redigi potuerunt illi qui adoleverunt 
in Aegypto, sed potuerunt, (o)tametsi aegre, infantes eorum, principio per miracula et postea per timores et captivitates, ut patet ex libri Joshuae et Judicum: inde constare potest quod 
omne repraesentativum genuinum seu internum Ecclesiae ab illis discesserit antequam venerunt in terram Canaanem, ubi repraesentativum externum Ecclesiae apud illos in plena forma inceptum est; terra 
enim Canaan erat ipsissima terra ubi repraesentativa Ecclesiae potuerunt sisti; omnia enim loca et omnes termini, ab antiquis temporibus, ibi repraesentaverunt, videatur n. 3686.      @1 i quidam$  
    @2 A had et cum inde evocati, nesciverunt nomen Jehovae, but altered to ubi ita vastabantur ut cum inde evocarentur, nesciverint ipsum nomen Jehovae, Possibly the ubi ita vastabantur ut was accidentally 
omitted in copying.$ </p>
