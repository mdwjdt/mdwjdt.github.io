<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2535节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2535.</strong>“他要为你祷告”表它因此受到启示。这从“祷告”的含义清楚可知。就其本身而言，“祷告”就是与神交谈，同时是对所祷告之事的某种内观（internal view）。对此的回应则带有某种类似进入直觉或这个人心智思维的流注之物，以致这个人的内层在某种程度上向神开放。不过，这种经验因这个人的状态，以及他所祷告的主题而异。若这个人出于爱和信，完全为了属天和属灵之物而祷告，那么类似启示的某种事物就会存在于他的祷告中，它会显现在祷告者的情感中，表现为希望、安慰或某种内在的喜悦。这就是为何“祷告”的内义表受到启示。此处这种意义尤为明显，因为经上说祷告的是先知，“先知”表示主，主的祷告无非是与神性的的内在交谈，同时也是启示。当祂祷告时，就会有启示。这一点明显可见于路加福音：<br />耶稣受了洗，正祷告的时候，天就开了。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路3.21.htm">3:21</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />耶稣带着彼得、约翰、雅各上山去祷告。正祷告的时候，祂的面貌就改变了，衣服洁白放光。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.28.htm">9:28</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.29.htm">29</a>）<br />在约翰福音，祂祷告时说：<br />父啊，荣耀你的名。当时就有声音从天上来说，我已经荣耀了我的名，还要再荣耀。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.27.htm">12:27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.28.htm">28</a>）<br />显然，此处主的祷告就是与神性交谈，同时也是启示。</p>

He shall pray for thee. That this signifies that it will thus be revealed, is evident from the signification of "praying." Prayer, regarded in itself, is speech with God, and some internal view at the 
time of the matters of the prayer, to which there answers something like an influx into the perception or thought of the mind, so that there is a certain opening of the man's interiors toward God; but 
this with a difference according to the man's state, and according to the essence of the subject of the prayer. If the man prays from love and faith, and for only heavenly and spiritual things, there 
then comes forth in the prayer something like a revelation (which is manifested in the affection of him that prays) as to hope, consolation, or a certain inward joy. It is from this that to "pray" 
signifies in the internal sense to be revealed. Still more is this the case here, where praying is predicated of a prophet, by whom is meant the Lord, whose prayer was nothing else than internal speech 
with the Divine, and at the same time revelation. That there was revelation is evident in Luke: </p>
<p>     It came to pass when Jesus was baptized, and prayed, that the heaven was opened (Luke 3:21). In 
the same: </p>
<p>     It came to pass that He took Peter, James, and John, and went up into the mountain to pray; and as He prayed, the fashion of His countenance was altered, and His raiment became white 
and glistening (Luke 9:28-29). In John: </p>
<p>     When He prayed, saying, Father glorify Thy name, then came there a voice from heaven: I have both glorified, and will glorify again (John 12:27-28); </p>
<p>where 
it is plain that the Lord's "praying" was speech with the Divine, and revelation at the same time. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2535</b></p><p><b>2535.</b>
'He will pray for you' means that it will thus be revealed. This is clear from the meaning of 'praying'. Regarded in itself prayer is talking to God and at the same time some inner view of the things 
that are being prayed for. Answering to this there is something akin to an influx into the perception or thought of the person's mind, which effects a certain opening of his internals towards God. But 
the experience varies according to the person's state and according to the essence of whatever he is praying for. If his prayer springs from love and faith, and if they are wholly celestial and spiritual 
things about which and for which he prays, something like a revelation is present within his prayer which manifests itself in the affection of the one praying in the form of hope, comfort, or some 
inward joy. This is why 'praying' in the internal sense means to be revealed. Here such a meaning is all the greater since it is a prophet who, it is said, will pray, and 'prophet' is used to mean 
the Lord, whose prayer was nothing else than an internal speaking to the Divine, and at the same time revelation. That there was revelation when He prayed is evident in Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
It happened, when Jesus 
was baptized and prayed, that heaven was opened. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%203:-21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 3:-21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
It happened, when Jesus took Peter, James, and John, He went up on the mountain to pray. When He was praying the 
appearance of His face was altered, and His clothing became dazzling white. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%209:-28,%2029&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 9:-28, 29</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Also in John, He said when praying, </p>
<blockquote>
Father, glorify Your name. Then a voice came from heaven, I have 
both glorified it and will glorify it again. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2012:-27,%2028&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 12:-27, 28</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here it is evident that the Lord's praying consisted in a talking to the Divine and at the same time in revelation. </p>

</p><b>2535.</b>
Quod `orabit pro te' significet quod sic revelabitur, constat a significatione `omne': oratio in se spectata est locutio cum Deo, et tunc aliqua intuitio interna eorum quae sunt orationis, cui correspondet 
quoddam simile influxus in perceptionem seu cogitationem ejus mentis, sic ut sit quaedam aperitio internorum hominis versus Deum; sed hoc cum differentia secundum statum hominis, `et secundum 
rei essentiam quae est orationis; si ex amore et fide, et modo caelestia et spiritualia sunt, de quibus et pro quibus oratur, tunc in oratione existit aliquid instar revelationis, quod manifestatur in 
orantis affectione quoad spem, solatium, aut internum quod gaudium; inde est quod `orare' in sensu interno significet revelari hic adhuc magis, quia dicitur de propheta, et {1} per `prophetam' intelligitur 
Dominus, cujus oratio non aliud fuit quam loquela interna cum Divino, et simul tunc revelatio; quod revelatio, patet apud Lucam 	Factum est,... cum Jesus baptizaretur, et oraret, quod aperiretur 
caelum, iii 21: </p>
<p>{2} apud eundem, 	Factum est,... cum Jesus assumens Petrum, Jacobum et Johannem, ascendit in montem ad orandum; cum Ipse oraret, facta est species faciei Ipsius alia, et vestimentum 
Ipsius album fulgurans, ix 28, 29: </p>
<p>{3} apud Johannem, cum oraret dicendo, 	Pater glorifica Tuum nomen; exiit tunc vox e caelo, Et glorificavi, et rursus glorificabo, xii 27, 28; </p>
<p>ubi quod oratio 
Domini fuerit loquela cum Divino, ac tunc revelatio, patet. 	@1 i hic.$ 	@2 i et.$ 	@3 `i tum.$ </p>
