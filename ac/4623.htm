But be it known that the life of sense with spirits is twofold, namely, real and not real. The one is distinguished from the other by the fact that everything is real which appears to those who are in 
heaven, whereas everything is unreal which appears to those who are in hell. For whatever comes from the Divine (that is, from the Lord) is real, because it comes from the very being of things, and 
from life in itself, but whatever comes from a spirit's own is not real, because it does not come from the being of things, nor from life in itself. They who are in the affection of good and truth are 
in the Lord's life, thus in real life, for the Lord is present in good and truth through the affection; but they who are in evil and falsity through the affection, are in the life of what is their own, 
thus in a life not real, for the Lord is not present in evil and falsity. The real is distinguished from the not real in this-that the real is actually such as it appears, and that the not real is 
actually not such as it appears. [2] They who are in hell have sensations equally with others, and are not aware but that everything is really or actually just as it appears to their senses; and yet 
when they are looked at by the angels, the same things appear as phantasms, and disappear, and they themselves do not appear as men, but as monsters. It has also been given me to speak with them on this 
subject, and some of them said that they believe things to be real because they see and touch them, adding that sense cannot deceive. But it was given me to reply that no matter how real these things 
may appear to them, they nevertheless are not real, and this because they themselves are in things contrary or opposite to the Divine, namely, in evils and falsities, and moreover are themselves nothing 
but phantasies insofar as their thoughts are concerned, to the extent that they are in cupidities of evil and persuasions of falsity; and to see anything from phantasies is to see things that are 
real as not real, and things that are not real as real; and that unless it were given them of the Lord's Divine mercy to have their senses affected in this manner, they would have no sensitive life, 
consequently no life at all, because that which is sensitive constitutes the whole of life. To adduce all my experience on these subjects would be to fill many pages. [3] Therefore when you enter the 
other life beware of being deceived, for evil spirits know how to conjure up illusions of many kinds before those who come fresh from the world, and if they cannot deceive them, they nevertheless thereby 
endeavor to persuade them that nothing is real, but that all things are ideal, even those which are in heaven. </p>

But it should be recognized that with spirits the life of their senses is of two different kinds - that which is real and that which is not real. One is distinguished from the other by the fact that 
everything seen by those in heaven is real, whereas everything seen by those in hell is not real. Whatever comes from the Divine, that is, from the Lord, is real since it comes from the Essential Being 
(Esse) itself within things and from self-existent Life; but whatever comes from a spirit's proprium is not real since it does not come from the Essential Being (Esse) within things nor from self-existent 
Life. Those who have an affection for goodness and truth have the Lord's life, and so the life that is real, within themselves; for the Lord is present within goodness and truth through the affection 
for these. But those who are governed by evil and falsity through their affection for these have the life of the proprium within them and so the life that is not real; for the Lord is not present 
within evil and falsity. The real is distinguishable from that which is not real by this- that the real is in actual fact what it appears to be, whereas that which is not real is not in actual fact 
what it appears to be. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 Those in hell have the five senses no less than anyone else, and are not aware of things being in reality or in actual fact anything other than what they perceive them to 
be with their senses. Yet when the angels look at the selfsame things these look to them like phantoms which then disappear, while the spirits themselves do not look like human beings but like monsters. 
I have also been allowed to talk to those in hell about this matter, and certain of them have said that they believe things are real when they can see and touch them, adding that the senses cannot 
mislead one. But I have been led to reply that no matter how real such things were seen to be by those spirits they were not real because those spirits themselves were governed by what was contrary 
or opposed to the Divine, that is to say, by evils and falsities. Furthermore, insofar as evil desires and false notions existed with those spirits, every thought they had was nothing else than an illusion. 
And when illusions lie behind one's view of anything, one sees real things as those which are not real, and those which are not real as those which are real. Also, unless the Lord in His Divine 
mercy gave them the use of the five senses they would not have any life that depends on sensory experience, nor therefore any life at all; for the whole of life involves the use of the senses. But to 
include every experience I have had in these matters would fill up very many pages. </p>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 Let people therefore be on their guard when they enter the next life, so that they are not deceived; for evil 
spirits know all kinds of ways to deceive the eyes of those recently arrived there from the world. Or if they are unable to delude them, those evil spirits nevertheless try by means of their deceptions 
to convince recent arrivals that nothing is real but that all things, including those in heaven, are no more than mental abstractions. </p>

Sed sciendum quod vita sensitiva spirituum duplex sit, nempe realis et non realis; distincta est una ab altera in eo quod omne id reale sit quod apparet illis qui in caelo, sed omne id non reale 
quod illis qui in inferno; quicquid enim venit ex Divino, hoc est, a Domino, hoc reale est, nam venit ab ipso Esse rerum et ex Vita in se; sed quicquid venit ex proprio spiritus, hoc non reale est, 
quia (t)non venit ex Esse {1}rerum et non ex Vita in se; qui in affectione boni et veri sunt, illi in vita Domini sunt, ita in vita reali, nam in bono et vero per affectionem Dominus est praesens, 
sed qui in malo et falso sunt per affectionem, illi in vita proprii sunt, ita in vita non reali, nam in malo et falso Dominus non est praesens.  Reale a non reali in eo distinguitur quod reale actualiter 
sit qualiter apparet, et quod non reale actualiter non ita sit qualiter apparet.  Qui in inferno sunt, habent aeque sensationes, et non sciunt 2 aliter quam quod realiter seu actualiter ita 
sit prout sentiunt, sed usque cum inspectantur ab angelis, tunc apparent eadem sicut phantasmata (c)et disparantur, et ipsi non sicut homines, sed sicut monstra; loqui etiam datum est cum illis de 
hac re, et quidam eorum dixerunt quod credant realia esse, quia vident et tangunt illa, addentes quod sensus non possit fallere; sed respondere datum quod usque non realia sint, et hoc esse inde quia 
in contrariis sunt seu in oppositis Divino, nempe in malis et falsis, utcumque {2}illa ut realia iis apparent; et praeterea ipsi, quatenus in cupiditatibus {3}mali et in persuasionibus falsi sunt, 
non {4}sint nisi quam phantasiae quoad cogitationes, et ex phantasiis aliquid videre est videre illa quae realia sunt ut non realia, et illa quae non realia ut realia; et nisi, ex Divina Domini 
misericordia, illis donatum esset ita sentire, nullam vitam sensitivam haberent, proinde nullam vitam, nam sensitivam facit omne vitae: omnem experientiam de his afferre, foret perplures 3 paginas 
implere.  Caveant itaque sibi {5}cum in alteram vitam veniunt, ne illudantur; sciunt enim mali spiritus coram illis qui recentes e mundo veniunt, varias illusiones sistere, et si non possunt fallere, 
usque tentant per illas persuadere quod nihil reale sit, sed quod idealia omnia, etiam quae in caelo.      @1 in se$      @2 illis illa ut realia apparent$      @3 et falsitatibus$      @4 sunt$
