Verses 11, 12. And Joseph made his father and his brethren dwell, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. And Joseph 
sustained his father, and his brethren, and all his father's house, with bread, according to the mouth of the babe. "And Joseph made his father and his brethren dwell," signifies the life of spiritual 
good and of the truths of the church from the internal celestial; "and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land," signifies in the inmost of the natural mind where memory-knowledges 
are; "in the land of Rameses," signifies the inmost of the mind and its quality; "as Pharaoh had commanded," signifies with the consent of the natural where memory-knowledges are; "and Joseph 
sustained his father, and his brethren, and all his father's house, with bread," signifies that from the internal celestial there was a continuous influx of good into spiritual good and the truths 
of the church in the natural, whence was their life; "according to the mouth of the babe," signifies each according to the quality of the good of innocence. </p>

Verses 11,12 And Joseph caused his father and his brothers to dwell, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Ramases, as Pharaoh had commanded. And Joseph

<p>'And Joseph caused his father and his brothers to dwell' means the 
life which spiritual good and the Church's truths received from the internal celestial. 'And gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land' means in the inmost part of the natural 
mind where factual knowledge resides. 'In the land of Rameses' means the inmost part of the mind and the essential nature of it. 'As Pharaoh had commanded' means with the acquiescence of the natural, 
where factual knowledge resides. 'And Joseph sustained his father, and his brothers, and all his father's household with bread' means that from the internal celestial there was a constant influx of 
good into spiritual good and the Church's truths in the natural, which gave them their life. 'According to the mouth of a young child' means each one in keeping with the essential nature of the good 
of innocence.

Vers. 11, 12.  Et habitare fecit Joseph patrem (x)suum et fratres suos, et dedit illis possessionem in terra Aegypti in optimo terrae, in terra Rameses, quemadmodum praecepit Pharaoh.  Et sustentavit 
Joseph patrem suum, et fratres suos, et totam domum patris (x)sui pane, ad os infantis.  `Et habitare fecit Joseph patrem suum et fratres suos' significat vitam boni spiritualis et verorum Ecclesiae 
a caelesti interno: `et dedit illis possessionem in terra Aegypti in optimo terrae' significat in intimo mentis naturalis ubi scientifica: `in terra Rameses' significat intimum mentis et quale ejus: 
`quemadmodum praecepit Pharaoh' significat consentiente naturali ubi scientifica: `et sustentavit Joseph patrem suum, et fratres suos, et totam domum patris sui pane' significat quod a caelesti interno
