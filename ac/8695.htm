<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8695节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8695.</strong>“我又叫他们知道神的典章和祂的律法”表他们从这个源头被教导，或说它教导他们何为真理，何为良善。这从“叫……知道”、“典章”和“律法”的含义清楚可知：“叫……知道”是指教导；“典章”是指真理（<a href="2235.htm">2235</a>，<a href="6397.htm">6397</a>节）；“律法”是指良善之真理。“律法”之所以是指良善之真理，是因为从广泛意义上说，“律法”表示整个圣言；从不怎么广泛的意义上说，是指圣言的历史部分；从狭义上说，是指摩西所写的圣言；从极狭义上说，是指十诫（<a href="6752.htm">6752</a>节）。因此，由于圣言是从主的神性良善发出的神性真理，所以“律法”是指良善之真理。良善之真理是源于良善的真理，本身就是良善，因为它们不断从良善获得自己的存在。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8695</b></p><p><b>8695.</b>
And I make known the judgments of God, and His laws. That this signifies that from this source they are taught what is true and what is good, is evident from the signification of "making known," as being 
to teach; from the signification of "judgments," as being truths (n. 2235, 6397); and from the signification of "laws," as being the truths of good. That "laws" denote the truths of good, is because 
in a wide sense "the law" signifies the whole Word, in a less wide sense the historic Word, in a close sense the Word which was written by Moses, and in the closest sense the ten commandments of the 
Decalogue (n. 6752). Consequently as the Word is the Divine truth which proceeds from the Divine good of the Lord, "laws" denote the truths of good. The truths of good are truths which are from good, 
and in themselves are goods, because they derive their spring from good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8695</b></p><p><b>8695.</b>
'And I make known the judgements of God and His laws' means that it teaches them what truth is and what good is This is clear from the meaning of 'making known' as teaching; from the meaning of 'judgements' 
as truths, dealt with in <a href="2235.htm">2235</a>, <a href="6397.htm">6397</a>; and from the meaning of 'laws' as the truths of good The reason why 'laws' are the truths of good is that in a broad sense 'the Law' means the whole Word, 
in a narrower sense the historical section of the Word, in a restricted sense the Word written through Moses, and in a very restricted sense the Ten Commandments, see <a href="6752.htm">6752</a>. Consequently, since the Word 
is Divine Truth which goes forth from the Lord's Divine Good, 'laws' are the truths of good. The truths of good are truths which spring from good, and are in themselves good since they derive their 
existence continually from good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 8695</b>
</p><b>8695.</b>
`Et nota facio judicia Dei et leges Ipsius': quod significet quod inde doceantur quid verum et quid bonum, constat ex significatione `nota facere' quod sit docere, ex significatione `judiciorum' quod 
sint vera, de qua n. 2235, 6397, et ex significatione `legum' quod sint vera boni; quod `leges' sint vera boni, est quia lex in lato sensu significat totum Verbum, in minus lato Verbum historicum, in 
stricto Verbum quod per Moschen scriptum est, et in strictissimo decem praecepta decalogi, videatur n. 6752; inde, quia Verbum est (t)Divinum Verum quod procedit ex Divino Bono Domini, inde leges sunt 
vera boni; vera boni sunt vera quae ex bono, et in se sunt bona, quia (t)suum existere ex bono trahunt. </p>
