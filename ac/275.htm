<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>275.</strong>创世记3:19 你必汗流满面才能得粮，直到你归了土，因为你是从土里出来的。你本是尘埃，仍要归于尘埃。<br />“汗流满面才能得粮”表厌恶属天之物，“回归所出之土”表重新落入外在，如重生前那样，“你本是尘埃，仍要归于尘埃”，表示他是被谴责的，属地狱的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]275.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_275/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_19" target=_top>Genesis 3:19</a>. "In the sweat of your face will you eat bread, until you return to the ground, because from it you were taken. For you are dirt, and to dirt you will return."<br />Eating bread in the sweat of his face means rejecting what is heavenly. Returning to the ground from which he was taken means returning to the external person as it was before regeneration. Being dirt and returning to dirt means being damned and resembling hell. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 275</b></p><p><b>275.</b>
Verse 19. In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken; for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. By "eating bread in the sweat 
of the face" is signified to be averse to what is celestial; to "return to the ground from whence he was taken" is to relapse into the external man, such as he was before regeneration; and "dust 
thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return" signifies that he is condemned and infernal. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 275</b></p><p><b>275.</b>
Verse 19 With sweat on your brow you will eat bread, till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you will return.  </p>
<p>'Eating bread with sweat on the brow' 
means strong dislike of what is celestial. 'Returning to the ground from which he was taken' is reverting to the external man, such as he was before regeneration took place. 'He was dust and would 
return to dust' means that he was condemned and hellish.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 275</b>
</p><b>275.</b>
Vers. 19.  In sudore vultus tui edes panem, usque dum redis in humum, quia ex ea sumptus es; quia pulvis tu, et ad pulverem redibis.  Per 'edere panem in sudore vultus' significatur aversari quod caeleste 
est: 'redire ad humum ex qua sumptus' est ad externum hominem qualis fuit ante regenerationem: 'quod pulvis et ad pulverem rediret' est quod damnatus et infernalis. </p>
