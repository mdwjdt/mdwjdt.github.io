<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5096节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5096.</strong>“就是被囚在监”表在虚假当中的。这从“被囚在监”的含义清楚可知，“被囚在监里”是指在虚假当中（参看<a href="4958.htm">4958</a>，<a href="5037.htm">5037</a>，<a href="5038.htm">5038</a>，<a href="5085.htm">5085</a>节）。那些陷入虚假的人，尤其那些陷入邪恶的人就被称为“被囚”、“在监里”，不是因为他们有任何肉体的束缚，而是因为他们不在自由中；事实上，那些不在自由中的人从内在被囚。因为他们一旦认同虚假，就再拥有任何选择并接受真理的自由；那些强烈认同的人甚至没有看见真理的任何自由主，更没有承认并相信真理的自由，因为他们深信虚假是真理，真理是虚假。这种信念在他们里面如此有力量，以致它剥夺了思想其它东西的一切自由，并且如此强烈，以致它把他们的实际思维束缚起来，可以说将其囚在监里。这一点已通过来世那些因在自己里面确认而深信虚假之人当中的大量经验向我清楚显明。他们就是那种根本不信奉任何真理，却远离或驱赶真理的人；他们在做这种事时的冷酷无情与他们的信服程度相称。当这种虚假是邪恶的产物时，也就是当邪恶使他们确信虚假时，尤其如此。他们就是主在马太福音的比喻中所指的人：<br />有些种子落在硬路上，飞鸟来吃尽了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.4.htm">13:4</a>）<br />“种子”是指神性真理；“硬磐石”是指信念；“飞鸟”是指虚假原则。<br />像这样的人甚至意识不到自己被囚或在监里，因为他们对自己的虚假充满感情，并因产生它的邪恶而热爱它。这使他们以为自己处于自由，因为凡他们对其有感情或热爱之物似乎都使他们感到自由。但那些并未真正认同虚假的人，也就是那些没有深信它的人则很容易信奉真理。他们看见并选择它们，对它们充满感情，然后可以说俯视虚假，还看到那些深信虚假的人如何被囚。他们因拥有这样的自由，故可以说能在整个天堂漫游，以寻求无数真理。但没有人能处于这种自由，除非他处于良善；因为人凭良善而在天堂；真理凭良善而在天堂显现。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5096</b></p><p><b>5096.</b>
Who were bound in the prison house. That this signifies which were among falsities, is evident from the signification of "being bound in a prison house," as being to be among falsities (see n. 4958, 
5037, 5038, 5085). They who are in falsities, and still more they who are in evils, are said to be "bound," and in "prison"-not that they are in any bond, but for the reason that they are not in freedom, 
for those who are not in freedom are interiorly bound. For they who have confirmed themselves in falsity are no longer in any freedom to choose and receive truth; and they who have much confirmed 
themselves therein are not even in freedom to see truth, still less to acknowledge and believe it; for they are in the persuasion that falsity is truth, and truth falsity. This persuasion is such that 
it takes away all freedom to think anything else, and consequently holds the very thought in bonds and as it were in prison. This has become evident to me from much experience with those in the other 
life who have been in persuasion of falsity through confirmations in themselves. [2] They are such as not at all to admit truths, but to reflect or strike them back again, and this with hardness according 
to the degree of the persuasion, especially when the falsity is from evil, or when evil has persuaded them. These are they who are meant in the Lord's parable in Matthew: </p>
<p>	Some seeds fell upon 
the hard way, and the birds came and devoured them (Matt. 13:4); </p>
<p>the "seeds" are Divine truths; the "hard rock" is persuasion; the "birds" are principles of falsity. They who are such do not even know 
that they are in bonds or in prison, for they are affected with their own falsity, and love it for the sake of the evil from which it springs; hence they suppose that they are in freedom, for whatever 
is of the affection or love appears free. But they who are not in confirmed falsity-that is, in the persuasion of falsity-easily admit truths, and see and choose them, and are affected with them, 
and afterward see falsities as it were beneath themselves, and also see how they who are in the persuasion of falsity are bound. These are in so much freedom that in view and thought they can as it were 
range through the whole heaven to innumerable truths; but no one can be in this freedom unless he is in good; for from good man is in heaven, and in heaven truths appear from good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5096</b></p><p><b>5096.</b>
'Who were bound in the prison house' means which were among falsities. This is clear from the meaning of 'being bound in the prison-house' as being among falsities, dealt with in <a href="4958.htm">4958</a>, <a href="5037.htm">5037</a>, <a href="5038.htm">5038</a>, <a href="5085.htm">5085</a>. 
Those who are engrossed in falsities, more so those steeped in evils, are called 'the bound" and 'in prison', not because they are held in any physical bonds but because they are not in freedom; for 
people who are not in freedom are inwardly in bonds. Indeed once they subscribe to falsity they no longer have any freedom to choose or receive what is true; and those who subscribe heavily to it do 
not have any freedom even to see it, let alone acknowledge it and believe it, because they are quite convinced that what is false is true and what is true is false. That conviction is so powerful in 
them that it removes all freedom to think anything different, and is so strong that it holds their actual thought in bonds, in prison so to speak. This has been made clear to me from considerable experience 
among those in the next life who have become quite convinced of falsity by harbouring ideas that serve to prove to it. They are the kind of people who do not entertain any truths at all but turn 
or drive these away, doing so with a degree of ruthlessness which matches the intensity of their conviction. This is primarily so when such falsity is the product of evil, that is, when evil causes 
them to be convinced of it. These are the ones who are meant in the Lord's parable in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Other seeds fell on the hard path, and the birds came and devoured them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Seeds' means 
Divine truths, 'hard rock' conviction, and 'birds' false assumptions. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 People like these are not even aware that they are in bonds or in prison, for they are full of affection for their falsity, 
loving it because of the evil which produces it. This leads them to think that they are in freedom, since everything they have an affection for or love seems to make them feel free. But those who have 
not really subscribed to falsity, that is, who have not become convinced of it, entertain truths easily. They see them, choose them, and are full of affection for them, after which they look down on 
falsities so to speak, and then see how those convinced of falsity have come to be in bonds. Having such freedom they are able in their contemplation and thought to roam so to speak through the whole 
of heaven in search of countless truths. But nobody can have this freedom except one who is governed by good; for it is by virtue of good that he is in heaven and by virtue of good that truths are seen there. </p>

</p><b>5096.</b>
`Qui vincti in domo carceris': quod significet quae inter falsa, constat ex significatione `vinctus esse in domo carceris' quod sit esse inter falsa, de qua n. 4958, 5037, 5038, 5085; qui in falsis 
sunt, et magis qui in malis, dicuntur `vincti' et `in carcere', non quod in aliquo vinculo sint, sed quia non in libero, qui enim non in libero sunt, ii sunt {1} interius vincti; nam qui in falso 
se confirmaverunt, non amplius in aliquo libero sunt eligendi et acceptandi verum, et qui multum se confirmaverunt, ne quidem in libero sunt videndi illud, minus agnoscendi et credendi, sunt enim 
in persuasione quod falsum sit verum et verum falsum; </p>
<p>persuasio talis est ut auferat omne liberum cogitandi aliud, consequenter ut ipsam cogitationem in vinculo et quasi in carcere teneat; hoc constare 
mihi potuit ex plure experientia apud illos in altera vita qui in persuasione falsi fuerunt per confirmationes apud se; sunt tales ut nequaquam admittant vera, reflectunt seu repercutiunt illa, 
et hoc duriter secundum persuasionis gradum; </p>
<p>imprimis cum falsum est ex malo, seu cum malum persuasit; sunt illi qui in parabola Domini intelliguntur apud Matthaeum, </p>
<p>          Alia semina ceciderunt 
super viam duram, et venerunt      aves et comederunt ea, xiii 4; </p>
<p> `semina' sunt vera Divina, `petra dura' est persuasio, `aves' sunt principia falsi.(n)  Qui tales sunt, ne quidem sciunt quod 
in vinculo sint, seu in carcere, afficiuntur enim falso suo, et amant illud propter malum ex quo; inde in libero se putant esse, quicquid enim est affectionis seu amoris, apparet liberum.  At qui 
non in falso confirmato, hoc est, in persuasione falsi {2} sunt, illi admittunt facile vera, et vident illa, et eligunt illa, et afficiuntur illis, et dein vident falsa sicut infra se, et quoque quomodo 
illi qui in persuasione falsi, vincti sunt; in tanto libero sunt ut possint intuitione et cogitatione exspatiari quasi per totum caelum, ad innumerabilia vera; sed in hoc libero nemo potest esse 
nisi qui est {3} in bono; ex bono enim est in caelo, et ex bono in caelo apparent vera. </p>
