<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6601节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6601.</strong>一天早晨，我被明显指示，任何一个观念或小的情感都拥有无数事物，这些观念和情感也渗透到我周围的社群。有一段时间，我被保持在某种情感和由此产生的思维中；在此期间，我被指示与这情感和思维一致的社群何等之多。有五个社群通过活生生的言语显明出来。他们阐述了自己的想法，还发现我也有同样的想法。另外，他们说，他们知道我所注意的事，也就是我们正在思想的问题背后的原因，以及这些的目的。我的思维所延伸到的其它众多社群没有如此清楚地显明出来，它们也更加遥远。<br />思维从它的对象，就是一个人正在思想的事物那里的延伸就像视觉对象的情形。来自视觉对象的光线传播到相当远的距离；这些光线进入人的视觉，并且无论距离是长是短，都能进入，这取决于视觉对象的明亮和发光度。因为若视觉对象在发光，那么它就能在比若它暗淡和幽暗的情况下远得多的距离处被看见。内在视觉，就是思维的视觉，和从内在视觉的对象发出的东西也一样。该视觉对象不像世上的物体那样是物质的，而是属灵的；因此，它们将光线传播到诸如属于灵界的那类事物中，因而传播到那里的真理和良善中，进而传播到充满这些真理和良善的社群中。正如这个世上的发光物体所发的光辐射得很远，在灵界，良善和对良善的情感也是如此；因为发光的火焰对应于对良善的情感。由此可见，人之生命的品质完全与他的思维和情感所延伸到的社群相匹配，也完全与这种延伸的质和量相匹配。</p>

One morning it was plainly shown that there are countless things in every idea and little affection, and also that these ideas and affections penetrate into societies. I was kept for some time in a certain 
affection and consequent thought, and it was then shown how many societies concurred. There were five societies that plainly showed themselves by living discourse. They told what they were thinking, 
and also that they had noticed that the same thoughts were in me; and they said in addition that they knew things I paid no attention to, namely, the causes of the things being thought of, and also 
the ends of these. The rest of the societies (which were many) to which my thought was extended, were not so plainly shown; and were also more remote. The extension of the thought from the objects 
which are the things being thought of, is circumstanced as are the objects of sight. From these a sphere of rays diffuses itself to a considerable distance, which falls into a man's sight, and this to 
a greater or less distance according to the brightness and flaming in the object; for if the object is flaming, it is seen at a much greater distance than if it is cloudy and dusky. It is the same with 
the internal sight (which is that of the thought) from its objects. The objects of this sight are not material, like objects in this world; but they are spiritual, and therefore they diffuse themselves 
to such things as are in the spiritual world, thus to truths and goods there, consequently to the societies which are in these truths and goods; and just as a flaming object in this world shines 
around far and wide, so does good and its affection in the spiritual world; for flame corresponds to the affection of good. From all this it can be seen that the quality of a man's life is altogether 
according to the societies into which his thought and affection extend themselves, and according to the quality and amount of this extension. </p>

One morning I was shown plainly that any one idea or small affection had countless facets, and also that such ideas and affections reached into those communities round about me. I was kept for some time 
in some affection or other and in the thought that arose from it, during which time I was shown how many communities were in agreement with that affection and thought. There were five communities 
that revealed themselves by means of actual speech. They stated what they were thinking and also that they recognized that I had the same thoughts. In addition they said that they knew about things to 
which I myself paid no attention - the causes behind the matters we were thinking about, and also the ends in view. The rest of the communities, which were very many, to which my thought spread were 
not so plainly revealed; they were also more distant. </p>

 The way thought extends from its objects - the things a person is thinking about - is like the situation regarding the objects of sight. From 
the latter rays disseminate themselves all around, reaching a considerable way out. Those rays enter a person's sight, and can do so at a longer or shorter distance, as the shine and glow of the object 
determine. For if it has a glow it can be seen from much further away than if it is dull and dark. Similar to this is inner sight, which belongs to thought, and what radiates from the objects of 
that sight. Its objects are not material like objects in the world, but are spiritual and therefore disseminate rays to such things as belong to the spiritual world - to truths and forms of good there, 
consequently to the communities which are imbued with those truths and forms of good. And just as a glow in the world radiates a very long way, so does good and the affection for it in the spiritual 
world; for a glowing flame corresponds to an affection for good. From all this it becomes clear that the character of a person's life matches exactly the communities into which his thought and affection 
extend as well as matching the nature and amount of that extension. </p>

Mane quodam ostensum est manifeste quod {1}unicuique ideae et affectiunculae innumerabilia inessent, {2}tum quod illae penetrarent in societates; tenebar in quadam affectione et inde cogitatione {3} 
per aliquod tempus, et tunc ostensum quot societates concurrerent; erant quinque societates quae se manifestabant per vivum sermonem; dicebant quid cogitabant, et quoque quod {4}apperceperint quod cogitationes 
illae apud me essent; praeter quod etiam scirent, ad quae ego non attendi, causas rerum quae cogitabantur, et quoque fines; reliquae societates, quae erant plures, ad quas {5}extendebatur cogitatio, 
non {6}ita manifestatae sunt, erant etiam remotiores.  [2]Cum extensione cogitationis ab objectis, quae sunt res de quibus cogitatur, se habet sicut cum objectis visus; ab his se diffundit sphaera 
radiorum ad multam distantiam, quae incidit in visum hominis, et hoc ad majorem et minorem distantiam secundum rutilum et flammeum in objecto; si enim flammeum, apparet hoc multo longinquius quam 
nubilum et fuscum; similiter visus internus, qui est cogitationis, a suis objectis; hujus visus objecta non sunt materialia sicut objecta in mundo, sed sunt spiritualia, ac ideo se diffundunt ad talia 
quae in mundo spirituali sunt, ita ad vera et bona ibi, proinde ad societates quae in illis sunt; et sicut flammeum in mundo se longissime circumfundit, ita bonum et ejus affectio in mundo spirituali, 
nam affectioni boni flamma correspondet.  Ex his constare potest quod qualitas vitae hominis se habeat prorsus secundum societates in quas cogitatio et affectio ejus se extendit, et secundum extensionis 
quale et quantum {7}. @1 unicuivis$ @2 et$ @3 i continue$ @4 apperciperent$ @5 se extendebat$ @6 tunc apperceptae sunt, quia erant$ @7 i inde est homini vel obscurum, vel clarum$ </p>
