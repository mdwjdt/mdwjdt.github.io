<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3034节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3034.</strong>创世记24:7.耶和华天上的神，曾带领我离开父家和本族之地，对我说话，向我起誓说，我要将这地赐给你的种，祂必差遣使者在你面前，你就可以从那里为我儿子娶一个妻子。<br />“耶和华天上的神”表主的神性本身。“曾带领我离开父家和本族之地”表主正是凭这神性本身摆脱了从母亲那里所接受的邪恶与虚假。“对我说话，向我起誓说”表其神圣意愿和理解力出自神性本身。“我要将这地赐给你的种”表属于主之人性的神圣真理。“祂必差遣使者在你面前”表神的旨意（Divine Providence）。“你就可以从那里为我儿子娶一个妻子”表对真理的情感的确出自那里，但却出自一个新的源头。</p>

Verse 7. Jehovah the God of heaven, that took me from my father's house, and from the land of my nativity, and that spoke unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land, 
He shall send His angel before thee, and thou shalt take a woman for my son from thence. "Jehovah the God of heaven," signifies the Lord's Divine Itself; "that took me from my father's house, and from 
the land of my nativity," signifies by virtue of which it was that the Lord freed Himself from the things of the mother as to evils and falsities; "and that spoke unto me, and that sware unto me, saying," 
signifies by virtue of which was His Divine willing and understanding; "Unto thy seed will I give this land," signifies the Divine truth pertaining to the Lord's Human; "He shall send His angel 
before thee," signifies the Divine providence; "and thou shalt take a woman for my son from thence," signifies that the affection of truth was indeed thence, but from a new source. </p>

Verse 7 Jehovah, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house and from the land of my nativity, and who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, To your seed I will give this land, He will 
send His angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there. </p>
<p>'Jehovah, the God of heaven' means the Lord's Divine itself. 'Who took me from my father's house and from the land of my 
nativity' means the Divine itself by whom the Lord freed Himself from the evils and from the falsities received from the mother. 'And who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying' means the Divine itself 
from whom came His Divine will and understanding. 'To your seed I will give this land' means the Divine Truth which belonged to the Lord's Human. 'He will send His angel before you' means Divine Providence. 
'And you shall take a wife for my son from there' means that the affection for truth came indeed from there, yet from a new source. </p>

Vers. 7.  Jehovah Deus caeli, Qui accepit me e domo patris mei, et e terra nativitatis meae, et Qui locutus est mihi, et Qui juravit mihi dicendo, Semini tuo dabo terram hanc, Ipse mittet angelum Suum 
coram te, et accipies mulierem filio meo inde.  `Jehovah Deus caeli' significat ipsum Divinum Domini: `Qui accepit me e domo patris mei, et e terra nativitatis meae' significat ex Quo Dominus liberavit 
Seipsum a maternis quoad mala et quoad falsa: `et Qui locutus est mihi, et Qui juravit mihi, dicendo' significat ex Quo Divinum Ipsius velle et intelligere: `semini tuo dabo terram hanc' significat 
Divinum Verum quod Humano Domini: `Ipse mittet angelum Suum coram te' significat Divinam Providentiam: `et accipies mulierem filio meo inde' significat quod affectio veri quidem inde sed ex ortu novo. </p>
