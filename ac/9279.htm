<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9279.</strong>“第七日要停止”表良善的状态，就是当人处于内在事物之时，以及那时他的和平与安宁。这从“第七日”或安息日和“停止”或停工的含义清楚可知：“第七日”或安息日是指当一个人处于良善，并被主通过良善引导的时候（参看<a href="8495.htm">8495</a>，<a href="8510.htm">8510</a>，<a href="8890.htm">8890</a>，<a href="8893.htm">8893</a>节）；“停止”或停工是指那时的和平与安宁。关于这种状态，可参看前面的阐述和说明（<a href="9274.htm">9274</a>，<a href="9278.htm">9278</a>节）。<br />必须简要说明为何当一个人处于良善时，他就处于内在事物。 一个人的外在事物照世界的形像形成，而他的内在事物则照天堂的形像形成（参看<a href="6057.htm">6057</a>节）。也正因如此，他的外在事物接受属于世界的一切事物，而他的内在事物接受属于天堂的一切事物。属于世界的外在事物从童年到成年在人里面逐渐被打开；他的内在事物也是如此。不过，外在事物是通过属于世界的事物被打开的，而内在事物则是通过属于天堂的事物被打开的。如此被打开的事物有两种，即理解力的事物和意愿的事物。理解力的事物通过与真理有关的事物被打开，意愿的事物则通过与良善有关的事物被打开；因为宇宙万物，无论世界上的事物还是天堂里的事物，都与真理和良善有关。与真理有关的事物被称为知识，与良善有关的事物被称为爱和情感。由此清楚可知打开人之生命的事物是什么，具有何种性质。<br />至于内在人，它是照着天堂的形像而形成的，如前所述；从主所获得的信，因而对主之信之真理和良善的知识，打开其理解力的事物。对真理和良善的情感，也就是从主所获得的爱，因而对主之爱的属性，打开其意愿的事物，从而在他里面形成天堂，进而形成主的一个形像；因为天堂就是主的一个形像。正因如此，天堂被称为大人（<a href="1276.htm">1276</a>，<a href="2996.htm">2996</a>，<a href="2998.htm">2998</a>，<a href="3624.htm">3624</a>-<a href="3649.htm">3649</a>，<a href="3741.htm">3741</a>-<a href="3750.htm">3750</a>，<a href="4218.htm">4218</a>-<a href="4228.htm">4228</a>节）；人是照着天堂的形像和世界的形像被造的（<a href="3628.htm">3628</a>，<a href="4523.htm">4523</a>，<a href="4524.htm">4524</a>，<a href="6013.htm">6013</a>，<a href="6057.htm">6057</a>节）；一个重生之人和一位天使就是最小形式的一个天堂和一个教会（<a href="1900.htm">1900</a>，<a href="3624.htm">3624</a>ff，<a href="3634.htm">3634</a>ff，<a href="3884.htm">3884</a>，<a href="4040.htm">4040</a>，<a href="4041.htm">4041</a>，<a href="4292.htm">4292</a>，<a href="4625.htm">4625</a>，<a href="6013.htm">6013</a>，<a href="6057.htm">6057</a>，<a href="6605.htm">6605</a>，<a href="6626.htm">6626</a>，<a href="8988.htm">8988</a>节）。由此可见为何当一个人处于良善时，他就处于内在事物。关于打开人的内在和外在事物，蒙主的神性怜悯，我将在下文予以详述。</p>

And on the seventh day thou shalt cease. That this signifies the state of good when the man is in internal things, and his tranquility of peace then, is evident from the signification of "the seventh 
day," or "Sabbath," as being when the man is in good, and is led by the Lord by means of good (see n. 8495, 8510, 8890, 8893); and from the signification of "ceasing," or "resting from works," as being 
the tranquility of peace then. (Concerning this state see what has been said and shown above, n. 9274, 9278.) [2] But it shall be briefly stated why, when a man is in good, he is in internal things. 
Man's External Things have been formed according to the Image of the World, and his Internal Things according to the Image of Heaven (see n. 6057); wherefore also his external things receive those 
which are of the world, but his internal things those which are of heaven. The external things which are of the world are opened in man successively from infancy even to manhood; in like manner the internal 
things. But the external things are opened by means of those which are of the world, whereas the internal things are opened by means of those which are of heaven. The things thus opened are twofold, 
namely, those of the understanding, and those of the will. The things of the understanding are opened by means of those which bear relation to truth, and the things of the will by means of those 
which bear relation to good; for all things in the universe, both those in the world and those in heaven, bear relation to truth and to good. Those which bear relation to truth are called knowledges; 
and those which bear relation to good are called loves and affections. From this it is clear what, and of what nature, are the things which open the life of man. [3] As regards the internal man, which 
as above said has been formed according to the image of heaven, it is the knowledges of the truth and good of faith from the Lord, and consequently of faith in the Lord, that open the things of its 
understanding; and it is the affections of truth and good, which are of love from the Lord, and consequently of love to the Lord, that open the things of its will, and consequently form within him heaven, 
thus the Lord in an image, for heaven is an image of the Lord. From this it is that heaven is called the Grand Man (n. 1276, 2996, 2998, 3624-3649, 3741-3750, 4218-4228); that man has been formed 
according to the image of heaven and the image of the world (n. 3628, 4523, 4524, 6013, 6057); and that a regenerate man, and an angel, is a heaven and a church in the least form (n. 1900, 3624, 3634, 
3884, 4040, 4041, 4292, 4625, 6013, 6057, 6605, 6626, 8988). From all this it can be seen why, when a man is in good, he is in internal things. But concerning the opening of man's internal and external 
things, of the Lord's Divine mercy more in what follows. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9279</b></p><p><b>9279.</b>
'And on the seventh day you shall cease' means a state of good, when the person is governed by internal things, and [his] peace and serenity then. This is clear from the meaning of 'the seventh day', 
or the sabbath, as a time when a person is governed by good and is led by the Lord by means of good, dealt with in <a href="8495.htm">8495</a>, <a href="8510.htm">8510</a>, <a href="8890.htm">8890</a>, <a href="8893.htm">8893</a>; and from the meaning of 'ceasing', or resting from work, as 
peace and serenity then. Regarding this state, see what has been stated and shown above in <a href="9274.htm">9274</a>, <a href="9278.htm">9278</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But a brief statement must be made to show why it is that when a person is governed by good 
he is governed by internal things. A PERSON'S EXTERNALS HAVE BEEN CREATED SO AS TO CONFORM TO AN IMAGE OF THE WORLD, BUT HIS INTERNALS TO CONFORM TO AN IMAGE OF HEAVEN, see <a href="6057.htm">6057</a>. Therefore also his 
externals receive things that belong to the world, but his internals those that belong to heaven. A person's externals belonging to the world are gradually opened up as he progresses from early childhood 
on into adult life; so are his internals. But the externals are opened up by things belonging to the world, whereas the internals are opened up by those belonging to heaven. Areas of the mind opened 
up in this way are of two kinds, those in the understanding and those in the will. Those in the understanding are opened up by things connected with truth, and those in the will by things connected 
with good; for everything in the whole created order, both in the world and in heaven, has connection with truth and good. The things connected with truth are called matters of knowledge and discernment, 
but those connected with good are called matters of love and affection. This shows exactly what those things are which open up a person's life and what they are like.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 As regards the internal 
man, which has been created so as to conform to an image of heaven, as has been stated, discernments of the truth and good of faith received from the Lord, and therefore of faith in the Lord, are 
what open up the areas in the understanding there. And affections for truth and good, which are attributes of love received from the Lord, and therefore of love offered to the Lord, are what open up 
the areas in the will, consequently form heaven and so an image of the Lord with him; for heaven is an image of the Lord. So it is that heaven is called the Grand Man, see <a href="1276.htm">1276</a>, <a href="2996.htm">2996</a>, <a href="2998.htm">2998</a>, <a href="3624.htm">3624</a>-<a href="3649.htm">3649</a>, <a href="3741.htm">3741</a>-<a href="3751.htm">3751</a>, <a href="4218.htm">4218</a>-<a href="4228.htm">4228</a>, and that the human being has been created so as to conform to an image of heaven and an image of the world, <a href="3628.htm">3628</a>, <a href="4523.htm">4523</a>, <a href="4524.htm">4524</a>, <a href="6013.htm">6013</a>, <a href="6057.htm">6057</a>, and a person who has been regenerated and 
an angel are heaven and the Church in their smallest form, <a href="1900.htm">1900</a>, <a href="3624.htm">3624</a>ff, <a href="3634.htm">3634</a>ff, <a href="3884.htm">3884</a>, <a href="4040.htm">4040</a>, <a href="4041.htm">4041</a>, <a href="4292.htm">4292</a>, <a href="4625.htm">4625</a>, <a href="6013.htm">6013</a>, <a href="6057.htm">6057</a>, <a href="6605.htm">6605</a>, <a href="6626.htm">6626</a>, <a href="8989.htm">8989</a>. From all this it becomes clear why it is that when a person 
is governed by good he is governed by internal things. But regarding the opening up of a person's internals and externals, more will in the Lord's Divine mercy be stated further on.  </p>

`Et die septimo cessabis': quod significet statum boni quando in internis, et [illius] tranquillum pacis tunc, constat ex significatione `diei septimi' seu sabbati, quod sit cum homo in bono est, et 
per bonum ducitur a Domino, de qua n. 8495, 8510, 8890, 8893, et ex significatione `cessare' seu quiescere ab operibus, quod sit tranquillum pacis tunc; de hoc statu videantur {1} quae supra, n;. 9274, 
(x)9278, dicta et ostensa sunt {2}. 	[2] Sed paucis dicetur unde id quod homo cum in bono, tunc in internis sit: EXTERNA HOMINIS FORMATA SUNT AD IMAGINEM MUNDI, INTERNA AUTEM AD IMAGINEM CAELI, {3} 
videatur n. 6057; quapropter etiam externa recipiunt illa quae mundi sunt, interna autem quae caeli sunt; externa quae mundi sunt aperiuntur apud hominem ab infantia usque ad virilem aetatem successive, 
pariter interna, sed externa aperiuntur per illa quae mundi sunt, at interna per illa quae caeli sunt; sunt bina quae ita aperiuntur, nempe intellectualia et voluntaria; intellectualia aperiuntur 
per illa quae se referunt ad verum, et voluntaria per illa quae se referunt ad bonum; omnia enim quae in universo sunt,, tam quae in mundo quam quae in caelo, se referunt ad verum et ad bonum; illa quae 
se referunt ad verum vocantur scientifica et cognitiones, quae autem se referunt ad bonum vocantur amores et affectiones; inde patet quaenam sunt et  qualia sunt quae aperiunt {4} vitam hominis. 	[3] 
Quod internum hominem attinet, qui (o)ut dictum est, ad imaginem caeli formatus est, (o)sunt cognitiones veri et boni fidei a Domino, (c)et inde amoris in Dominum, quae aperiunt intellectualia ejus; 
et sunt affectiones veri et boni, quae sunt amoris a Domino, (c)et inde amoris in Dominum, quae aperiunt voluntaria ejus, consequenter formant caelum, ita in imagine Dominum, (o)apud illum, nam caelum 
est imago Domini; inde est quod caelum dicatur Maximus Homo, videatur n. 1276, 2996, (x)2998, 3624-3649, 3741-3751, (x)4218-4228, et quod homo ad imaginem caeli et ad imaginem mundi formatus sit,
