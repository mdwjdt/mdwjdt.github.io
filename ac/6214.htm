<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6214节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6214.</strong>让一个人相信灵人知道他的思维何等困难，这一点已通过下面的经历向我证明了。在我与灵人交谈之前，有一个灵人向我简要说了说我正在思考的事。一个灵人竟然知道我的想法，这令我目瞪口呆；我原以为这类想法是隐藏的，只有神知道。后来，当我开始与灵人交谈时，气愤地发现，我根本没有他们所不知道的任何想法，这令我很是烦恼。但过了几天我就习惯了。最后我发现，灵人不仅能察觉存在于一个人的思维和意愿中的一切事物，还能察觉远远比此人自己所察觉到的还要多的事物；天使察觉到的，甚至比这还多，也就是说，他们察觉他的意图和目的，从最初的通过中间的，直到最后的；主不仅知道整个人的品质，还知道他的品质直到永远是什么样。由此明显可知，绝对没有什么东西是隐藏的；相反，人的内心想法和图谋在来世如同在晴天白日之下那样清晰可见。</p>

How difficult it is for man to believe that spirits know his thoughts, was made evident to me by the following circumstance. Before I spoke with spirits it happened that a certain spirit said a few words 
to me about that of which I was thinking. It amazed me that a spirit should know this; because I supposed that such things were hidden, and known only to God. Afterward, when I began to speak with 
spirits, I was indignant that I could not think anything that they did not know, and because this would be troublesome to me. But after I had been accustomed to it for a few days it became familiar 
to me. At last I found that spirits not only perceive all things of man's thought and will, but also many more things than the man himself perceives; and that the angels perceive still more, namely the 
intentions and ends, from the first through the middle to the last; and that the Lord knows not only the quality of the whole man, but also what his quality will be to eternity. From this it is evident 
that nothing whatever is hidden; but that what a man inwardly thinks and plots is in the other life made manifest as in clear day. </p>

How difficult it is for a person to believe that spirits know his thoughts has been proved to me by the following experience. Before I talked to spirits some spirit happened to address me briefly on 
the matters I was thinking about. I was dumbfounded by this, that a spirit could know my thoughts, for I had supposed that such thoughts lay hidden and were known to God alone. After that, when I began 
to talk to spirits, I was indignant that I could not have any thought at all which they did not know and that this was going to prove irksome to me. But then over several days I grew accustomed to it. 
At length I also came to know that spirits not only discern everything present in a person's thought and will, but also far more than the person himself discerns; that the angels discern even more 
than that, namely his intentions and ends in view from the primary, through the intermediate, to the final ones; and that the Lord knows not only what the entire person is like now but also will be for 
evermore. This has proved to me that absolutely nothing is hidden, but that a person's inward thought and designs are as plain to see in the next life as if in broad daylight.  </p>

</p><b>6214.</b>
Quam difficile sit ut homo credat quod spiritus sciant cogitationes ejus, constare mihi potuit ex eo; antequam loquebar cum spiritibus, contigit quod spiritus quidam me alloqueretur paucis verbis de 
illis quae cogitabam; inde obstupefactus sum quod spiritus id sciret, quia putabam quod talia recondita essent et soli Deo nota.  Dein cum inciperem loqui cum spiritibus, indignatus sum quod nihil cogitare 
potuissem quod non illi scirent, et quod id mihi molestum futurum esset; sed postea per aliquot dierum assuetudinem familiare mihi factum est.  Tandem etiam notum quod spiritus non solum omnia 
cogitationis et voluntatis hominis appercipiant, sed etiam multo plura quam ipse homo; et quod angeli adhuc plura, quod nempe intentiones ac fines a primis per medios ad ultimos; et quod Dominus sciat 
non solum qualis homo totus est sed etiam qualis futurus in aeternum.  Inde constare potest quod prorsus nihil absconditum sit, sed quod homo intus cogitat et machinatur, pateat in altera vita ut in 
clara die. </p>
