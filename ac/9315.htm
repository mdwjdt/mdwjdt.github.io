<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9315节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9315.</strong>“我的使者要走在你前面”表一种遵从主诫命的生活。这从“走在你面前”和“耶和华的使者”的含义清楚可知：“走在你面前”当论及主，即此处“耶和华的使者”时，是指教导信仰和生活的诫命，因而也指一种遵从这些诫命的生活，“走”和“寄居”都表示生活（参看<a href="1293.htm">1293</a>，<a href="3335.htm">3335</a>，<a href="4882.htm">4882</a>，<a href="5493.htm">5493</a>，<a href="5605.htm">5605</a>，<a href="8417.htm">8417</a>，<a href="8420.htm">8420</a>，<a href="8557.htm">8557</a>，<a href="8559.htm">8559</a>节）；“耶和华的使者”是指主的神性人身，如前所述（<a href="9303.htm">9303</a>，<a href="9306.htm">9306</a>节）。“使者”（angel，经上或译为天使），之所以表示主的神性人身，是因为在主降世之前显现的许多天使或使者就是一个人的形式，也就是一位天使或使者形式的耶和华自己。这一点从以下事实很明显地看出来，显现的天使或使者被称为“耶和华”，如那些亚伯拉罕显现的天使或使者被称为“耶和华”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创18.1.htm">18:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创18.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创18.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创18.17.htm">17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创18.20.htm">20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创18.26.htm">26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创18.33.htm">33</a>）；向我们在士师记中所读到的基甸显现的使者也被称为“耶和华”（6:12，14，16，22-24）；此外还有其它地方。人的形式了，或也可说一位天使或使者形式的耶和华自己就是主。<br />那时，祂的神性人身显为一位天使或使者；对此，主自己在约翰福音中说：<br />耶稣说，亚伯拉罕欢欢喜喜地仰望我的日子，既看见了，就快乐。我实实在在地告诉你们：还没有亚伯拉罕就有了我。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.56.htm">8:56</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.58.htm">58</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />父啊，现在求你使我同你自己享荣耀，就是未有世界以先，我同你所有的荣耀。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.5.htm">17:5</a>）<br />耶和华无法其它任何方式显现，这一点也可从主在约翰福音中的话明显看出来：<br />你们从来没有听见父的声音，也没有看见祂的形状。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.37.htm">5:37</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />这不是说有人看见过父，惟独与父同在的，祂看见过父。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.46.htm">6:46</a>）<br />由此可见“永恒之主”是什么意思。<br />主之所以乐意出生为人，是为了祂能实实在在地披上人性，并使之变成神性，好拯救人类。因此，要知道，主就是耶和华自己，或一个人形式的父，主自己在约翰福音中所教导了这一点：<br />我与父为一。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.30.htm">10:30</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />耶稣说，从今以后，你们认识并且已经看见父。人看见了我，就是看见了父。你们当信我，我在父里面，父在我里面。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.7.htm">14:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.11.htm">11</a>）<br /><br />凡是我的都是你的，你的也是我的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.10.htm">17:10</a>）<br />约翰福音中的这些话描述了这一伟大奥秘：<br />太初有圣言，圣言与神同在，圣言就是神。祂太初与神同在。万物是藉着祂造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是藉着祂造的。圣言成了肉身，住在我们中间。我们也见过祂的荣光，正是父独生子的荣光。从来没有人看见神，只有在父怀里的独生子将祂表明出来。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.18.htm">18</a>）<br />“圣言”表示揭示给人类的神性真理；因为它若不通过作为一个人的耶和华，也就是通过一个人形式的耶和华，因而通过主，就无法被揭示出来，故经上说“太初有圣言，圣言与神同在，圣言就是神”。在教会，众所周知，“圣言”表示主，因为经上说得很明确：“圣言成了肉身，住在我们中间。我们也见过祂的荣光，正是父独生子的荣光”。神性真理若不通过一个人形式的耶和华，就无法被揭示给人类，经上也清楚说明了这一点，即：“从来没有人看见神，只有在父怀里的独生子将祂表明出来”。<br />由此明显可知，永恒之主就是一个人形式的耶和华，或父；但在肉身上不是如此，因为一位天使没有这种肉身。由于耶和华或父愿意披上整个人身，好拯救人类，所以祂也取了肉身。这就是为何说“圣言就是神，圣言成了肉身”。路加福音：<br />你们看我的手，我的脚，是我自己；摸我看看！灵无肉无骨，你们看，我是有的。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.39.htm">24:39</a>）<br />主以这些话教导，祂不再是一位天使形式的耶和华；祂是作为人的耶和华。这一点也是主的这些话所表示的：<br />我从父出来，到了世界；我又离开世界，往父那里去。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.28.htm">16:28</a>）<br />主在世时，使祂的人身变成神性（参看<a href="1616.htm">1616</a>，<a href="1725.htm">1725</a>，<a href="1813.htm">1813</a>，<a href="1921.htm">1921</a>，<a href="2025.htm">2025</a>，<a href="2026.htm">2026</a>，<a href="2033.htm">2033</a>，<a href="2034.htm">2034</a>，<a href="2083.htm">2083</a>，<a href="2523.htm">2523</a>，<a href="2751.htm">2751</a>，<a href="2798.htm">2798</a>，<a href="3038.htm">3038</a>，<a href="3043.htm">3043</a>，<a href="3212.htm">3212</a>，<a href="3241.htm">3241</a>，<a href="3318.htm">3318</a>e，<a href="3637.htm">3637</a>，<a href="3737.htm">3737</a>，<a href="4065.htm">4065</a>，<a href="4180.htm">4180</a>，<a href="4211.htm">4211</a>，<a href="4237.htm">4237</a>，<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>，<a href="4585.htm">4585</a>，<a href="4687.htm">4687</a>，<a href="4692.htm">4692</a>，<a href="4724.htm">4724</a>，<a href="4738.htm">4738</a>，<a href="4766.htm">4766</a>，<a href="5005.htm">5005</a>，<a href="5045.htm">5045</a>，<a href="5078.htm">5078</a>，<a href="5110.htm">5110</a>，<a href="5256.htm">5256</a>，<a href="6373.htm">6373</a>，<a href="6700.htm">6700</a>，<a href="6716.htm">6716</a>，<a href="6849.htm">6849</a>，<a href="6864.htm">6864</a>，<a href="6872.htm">6872</a>，<a href="7014.htm">7014</a>，<a href="7211.htm">7211</a>，<a href="7499.htm">7499</a>，<a href="8547.htm">8547</a>，<a href="8864.htm">8864</a>，<a href="8865.htm">8865</a>，<a href="8878.htm">8878</a>节）；祂抛弃了从母亲所获得的一切人身之物，直到最后祂不是马利亚的儿子（<a href="2159.htm">2159</a>，<a href="2649.htm">2649</a>，<a href="2776.htm">2776</a>，<a href="4963.htm">4963</a>，<a href="5157.htm">5157</a>；尤其<a href="3704.htm">3704</a>，<a href="4727.htm">4727</a>，<a href="9303.htm">9303</a>，<a href="9306.htm">9306</a>节）；在所引用的章节（<a href="9194.htm">9194</a>，<a href="9199.htm">9199</a>节）有关于这些事的说明。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9315</b></p><p><b>9315.</b>
When Mine angel shall go before thee. That this signifies a life in accordance with the commandments of the Lord, is evident from the signification of "going before thee," when said of the Lord, who 
is here the "angel of Jehovah," as being to teach the commandments of faith and of life, thus also a life in accordance with these commandments (that "to go," and "to journey," denote to live, see n. 
1293, 3335, 4882, 5493, 5605, 8417, 8420, 8557, 8559); and from the signification of "the angel of Jehovah," as being the Lord as to the Divine Human (of which above, n. 9303, 9306). That the Lord as 
to the Divine Human is meant by the "angel," is because the many angels who appeared before the coming of the Lord into the world were Jehovah Himself in a human form, that is, in the form of an angel. 
This is very evident from the fact that the angels who appeared were called "Jehovah," as for instance those who appeared to Abraham and were called "Jehovah" (Gen. 18:1, 13, 14, 17, 20, 26, 33); also 
the angel who appeared to Gideon, of whom we read in Judges, and who also was called "Jehovah" (6:12, 14, 16, 22-24); besides others elsewhere. Jehovah Himself in the human form, or what is the same, 
in the form of an angel, was the Lord. [2] At that time His Divine Human appeared as an angel; of which the Lord Himself speaks in John: </p>
<p>     Jesus said, Abraham rejoiced to see My day; and he saw 
it, and was glad. Verily, verily, I say unto you, before Abraham was, I am (John 8:56, 58).      Father, glorify Thou Me with Thine own self with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was 
(John 17:5). That Jehovah could not appear in any other way, is evident also from the words of the Lord in John: </p>
<p>     Ye have not heard the voice of the Father at any time, nor seen His shape (John 
5:37).      Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he who is with the Father, he hath seen the Father (John 6:46). From these passages it may be known what is meant by the Lord from eternity. [3] 
The reason why it pleased the Lord to be born a man, was that He might put on the Human actually, and make it Divine, in order to save the human race. Know therefore that the Lord is Jehovah Himself 
or the Father in a human form, which also the Lord Himself teaches in John: </p>
<p>     I and the Father are one (John 10:30).      Jesus said, From henceforth ye have known and have seen the Father; 
He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father. Believe Me that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me (John 14:7, 9, 11).      All things that are Mine are Thine, and all Thine are Mine (John 17:10). [4] 
This great mystery is stated in John in these words: </p>
<p>     In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. The same was in the beginning with God. All thing were made 
by Him; and without Him was not anything made that was made. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father. No man hath seen 
God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath set Him forth (John 1:1-3, 14, 18); </p>
<p>"the Word" denotes the Divine truth which has been revealed to men; and because 
this could not be revealed except by Jehovah as a Man, that is, except by Jehovah in a human form, thus by the Lord, therefore it is said, "in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, 
and God was the Word." It is known in the church that by "the Word" is meant the Lord, because this is plainly said: "the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory 
as of the only-begotten of the Father." That the Divine truth could not be revealed to men except by Jehovah in a human form, is also clearly stated: "no man hath seen God at any time; the only-begotten 
Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath set Him forth."  [5] From all this it is evident that the Lord from eternity was Jehovah, or the Father, in a human form; but not yet in the flesh, 
for an angel has no "flesh." And because Jehovah or the Father willed to put on the whole human, for the salvation of the human race, therefore He took on the flesh also. Wherefore it is said "God was 
the Word, and the Word was made flesh." And in Luke: </p>
<p>     Behold My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself; handle Me and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see Me have (Luke 24:39); </p>
<p>by 
these words the Lord taught that He was no longer Jehovah under the form of an angel; but that He was Jehovah Man, which is also meant by these words of the Lord: </p>
<p>     I came out from the Father, 
and am come into the world; again I leave the world, and go unto the Father (John 16:28). (That the Lord when in the world made His Human Divine, see n. 1616, 1725, 1813, 1921, 2025, 2026, 2033, 2034, 
2083, 2523, 2751, 2798, 3038, 3043, 3212, 3241, 3318, 3637, 3737, 4065, 4180, 4211, 4237, 4286, 4585, 4687, 4692, 4724, 4738, 4766, 5005, 5045, 5078, 5110, 5256, 6373, 6700, 6716, 6849, 6864, 6872, 
7014, 7211, 7499, 8547, 8864, 8865, 8878; also that He expelled all the human that was from the mother, until at last He was not the son of Mary, n. 2159, 2649, 2776, 4963, 5157; see especially n. 3704, 
4727, 9303, 9306, and what has been shown about these things in the passages cited in n. 9194, 9199.) </p>

'When My angel goes before you' means a life in keeping with the Lord's commandments. This is clear from the meaning of 'going before you' - when it refers to the Lord, who is 'the angel of Jehovah' 
here - as teaching the commandments of faith and life, and therefore also a life in keeping with those commandments, ('going' and 'travelling on' mean living, see <a href="1293.htm">1293</a>, <a href="3335.htm">3335</a>, <a href="4882.htm">4882</a>, <a href="5493.htm">5493</a>, <a href="5605.htm">5605</a>, <a href="8417.htm">8417</a>, <a href="8420.htm">8420</a>, <a href="8557.htm">8557</a>, <a href="8559.htm">8559</a>); and from the meaning of 'the angel of Jehovah' as the Lord's Divine Human, dealt with above in <a href="9303.htm">9303</a>, <a href="9306.htm">9306</a>. The reason why the Lord's Divine Human is meant by 'the angel' is that the 
numerous angels who appeared in times before the Lord's Coming into the world were Jehovah Himself in human form, that is, in that of an angel. This is plainly evident from the fact that angels who appeared 
were called Jehovah, such as those who appeared to Abraham and are spoken of in Genesis <a href="18.htm">18</a>. The fact that they were called Jehovah may be seen in verses 1, 13, 14, 17, 20, 26, 33, of that chapter, 
as was the one who appeared to Gideon and is spoken of in Judges <a href="6.htm">6</a>. The fact that this angel too was called Jehovah may be seen in verses 12, 14, 16, 22-24, of that chapter. The same may be seen in 
other places besides these. Jehovah Himself in human form, or what amounts to the same thing, in that of an angel, was the Lord. </p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 His Divine Human appeared in those times as an angel, of whom the 
Lord Himself speaks in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said, Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and saw it and was glad. Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham was, I am. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%208:56,%2058&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 8:56, 58</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And in the same gospel, 
 </p>
<blockquote>
Father, glorify Me in Your Own Self with the glory I had with You before the world was. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2017:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 17:5</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Jehovah could not have appeared in any other way, as is again clear from the Lord's words, in 
John,  </p>
<blockquote>
You have never heard the Father's voice nor seen His shape. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%205:37&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 5:37</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And in the same gospel,  </p>
<blockquote>
No one has seen the Father except Him who is with God,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> He has seen the Father. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%206:46&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 6:46</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From all this one may see what is meant by 'the Lord from eternity'.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The reason why the Lord was pleased to be born as Man (Homo) was in order that He might in reality take on a Humanity 
and make it Divine, to save the human race. Know therefore that the Lord is Jehovah Himself or the Father in human form, as yet again the Lord Himself teaches in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
I and the Father are one. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2010:30&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 10:30</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the same gospel,  </p>
<p>Jesus said, From now on you know and have seen the Father. He who has seen Me has seen the Father. Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me. John 
14:7, <a href="9.htm">9</a>, <a href="11.htm">11</a>.  </p>
<p>And in the same gospel,  </p>
<blockquote>
All Mine are Yours, and all Yours are Mine. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2017:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 17:10</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 This great mystery is described in John in the following words,  </p>
<blockquote>
In the beginning was 
the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made. And the Word became flesh 
and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, glory as of the Only Begotten from the Father. Nobody has ever seen God; the only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, He has made Him known. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:1-3,%2014,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:1-3, 14, 18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The Word' is Divine Truth which has been revealed to mankind; and since it could not have been revealed except by Jehovah as Man, that is, except by Jehovah in human form, thus 
by the Lord, it says, 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'. It is well known in the Church that 'the Word' is used to mean the Lord, for it is explicitly 
stated, 'The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, glory as of the Only Begotten from the Father'. The fact that Divine Truth could not have been revealed to mankind except by 
Jehovah in human form is also clearly stated, 'Nobody has ever seen God; the only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, He has made Him known'.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 From all this it is evident that the 
Lord from eternity was Jehovah or the Father in human form, but not yet so in earthly flesh, for an angel does not have such flesh. And since Jehovah or the Father wished to take on everything human in 
order to save the human race, He also took flesh. This is why it says, The Word was God, and the Word became flesh, and in Luke,  </p>
<blockquote>
See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself; handle Me and see; 
for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see Me have. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2024:39&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 24:39</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>By this the Lord taught that He was no longer Jehovah under the form of an angel but that He was Jehovah as Man. This is 
also what the following words spoken by the Lord serve to mean,  </p>
<blockquote>
I came out from the Father and have come into the world; again I am leaving the world and going off to the Father. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2016:28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 16:28</a>.

`Cum iverit angelus Meus ante te': quod significet vitam secundum praecepta Domini, constat ex significatione `ire ante te' cum de Domino, Qui hic est `angelus Jehovae,' quod sit docere praecepta fidei 
et vitae, ita quoque vita secundum illa praecepta; quod `ire et proficisci' sit vivere, videatur n. 1293, 3335, 4882, 5493, (x)5605, 8417, 8420, 8557, 8559; et ex significatione `angeli Jehovae' quod 
sit Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum, de qua supra n. 9303, (x)9306.  Quod Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum per `angelum' intelligatur, est quia (o)plures angeli qui apparuerunt ante Adventum Domini in 
mundum, fuerunt Ipse Jehovah in forma humana, seu in forma angeli; quod patet manifeste ex eo quod vocaverint angelos qui apparuerunt, Jehovam, sicut qui apparuerunt Abrahamo, de quibus in Gen. xviii; 
quod illi Jehovah (x)appellati sint, videatur ibi vers. 1, 13, 14, 17, 20, 26, 33, et qui apparuit Guideoni, de quo in Jud. vi; quod ille etiam Jehovah appellatus sit, videatur ibi vers. 12, 14, 16, 
22-24, praeter etiam alibi; Ipse Jehovah in forma humana, seu quod idem, in forma angeli, erat Dominus; [2] Divinum Humanum Ipsius apparuit tunc sicut angelus, de quo Ipse Dominus loquitur apud Johannem, 	(m)Jesus 
dixit, Abraham exsultavit ut videret diem Meum, et vidit et gavisus est: amen, amen, dico vobis, Priusquam Abraham fuit, Ego sum, viii 56, 58: </p>
<p>et apud eundem, 	Glorifica Me Tu, Pater, 
apud Te Ipsum gloria quam habui antequam mundus esset apud Te, xvii 5. Quod Jehovah aliter non potuerit apparere, constat quoque ex Domini verbis apud Johannem, 	Non vocem Patris audivistis unquam, 
neque speciem Ipsius vidistis, v 37: </p>
<p>(m)et apud eundem, 	Non quod Patrem viderit quis, nisi qui {1} apud Deum {2}, hic vidit Patrem, (x)vi 46.(n) Ex his sciri potest quid Dominus ab aeterno. 	[3] 
Quod placuerit Domino nasci Homo, fuit ut actualiter indueret Humanum et hoc Divinum faceret ad salvandum genus humanum.  Scias itaque quod Dominus sit Ipse Jehovah seu Pater in forma humana, quod etiam 
Ipse (o)Dominus docet apud Johannem, 	Ego et Pater unum sumus, (x)x 30: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Jesus dixit, Patrem abhinc cognovistis et vidistis; qui vidit Me vidit Patrem:{3} credite Mihi quod Ego in 
Patre et Pater in Me, xiv (o)7, 9, 11: </p>
<p>et apud eundem, 	Omnia Mea Tua sunt, et omnia Tua Mea, xvii 10. 	[4] {4} Hoc magnum mysterium describitur apud Johannem, his verbis, 	In principio erat Verbum, 
et Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum; Hoc erat in principio apud Deum: omnia per Ipsum facta sunt, et sine Ipso jactum est nihil quod factum est.  Et Verbum caro factum est et habitavit inter 
nos, et vidimus gloriam Ipsius, gloriam ut Unigeniti a Patre.  Deum nemo vidit usquam; Unigenitus Filius, Qui in sinu Patris est, Ipse exposuit, i 1-3, 14, 18; </p>
<p>Verbum est Divinum Verum quod hominibus 
revelatum est, et quia hoc revelari non potuit nisi a Jehovah ut homine, hoc est, nisi a Jehovah in humana forma, ita a Domino, ideo dicitur `in principio erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud Deum, et 
Deus erat Verbum'; in Ecclesia notum est quod per `Verbum' intelligatur Dominus, quia (o)hoc aperte dicitur, `Verbum caro factum est et habitavit inter nos, et vidimus gloriam Ipsius, gloriam ut Unigeniti 
a Patre'; quod Divinum Verum non potuerit revelari hominibus nisi a Jehovah in humana forma, etiam clare dicitur, `Deum nemo vidit usquam; Unigenitus Filius, Qui in sinu Patris, Ipse exposuit.' 	[5] 
Ex his patet quod Dominus ab aeterno fuerit Jehovah seu Pater in forma humana, sed nondum in carne, nam angelus non habet carnem; et quia Jehovah seu Pater voluit induere omne humanum propter salvationem 
generis humani, ideo quoque assumpsit carnem, quare dicitur, Deus erat Verbum, et Verbum caro factum est; et apud Lucam, 	Videte manus Meas, et pedes Meos, quod Ipse Ego sim; palpate Me et 
videte; nam spiritus carnem et ossa non habet, sicut Me videtis habere {5}, xxiv 39; </p>
<p>Dominus per haec docuit quod non amplius esset Jehovah sub forma angeli, sed quod esset Jehovah Homo: (m)quod etiam 
intelligitur per haec Domini verba, 	Exivi a Patre et veni in mundum: iterum relinquo mundum et abeo ad Patrem, Joh. xvi 28.(n) Quod Dominus Humanum Suum, cum fuit in mundo, Divinum fecerit, videatur
