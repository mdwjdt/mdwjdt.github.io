<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7836节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7836.</strong>“按着灵魂的数目；你们要按各人所吃的饭量来计算羔羊”表按着吸收纯真所需的确切数量以良善之真理来填满良善，由此使得良善足以满足纯真。这从“灵魂的数目”、“各人所吃的饭量”和“羔羊”的含义清楚可知：“灵魂的数目”是指如此多的良善之真理，因为在圣言中，“数目”论及真理，“灵魂”论及属灵良善；、“各人所吃的饭量”是指照着吸收它所需的量，“吃”表示吸收或变成人自己的（参看<a href="3168.htm">3168</a>，<a href="3513.htm">3513</a>，<a href="3596.htm">3596</a>，<a href="3832.htm">3832</a>节）；“羔羊”是指纯真（<a href="7832.htm">7832</a>节）。通过填满良善而使良善足以满足纯真，由“从隔壁邻舍家”取足以满足羔羊的数目来表示，“家”表示良善（参看<a href="7833.htm">7833</a>节）。当此处说到“良善之真理”时，所指的是源于良善的真理。因为当那些属于属灵教会的人正在重生时，他们通过信之真理被引入仁之良善；不过，一旦他们被引入仁之良善，之后由该良善所生的真理就被称为良善之真理。<br />但是，没有人知道当如何理解本节所包含的这些事，除非他知道天堂里的社群是如何彼此联结的；因为以色列人照着支派、家族和家庭生活来往的方式就代表了这些社群。至于天堂里的社群，情况是这样：作为一个整体的天堂是一个社群，主将该社群作为一个人来掌管。那里的总体社群和人的肢体、脏腑、器官数量一样多；而具体社群与每个脏腑、肢体、器官的组成部位数量一样多；个体社群则如同构成较大部位的较小部位一样多。情况就是这样，这从人及其肢体、器官、脏腑与大人，就是天堂的对应关系明显看出来，我们在众多章节末尾已经通过经历论述了这种对应关系。由此可见在天堂，社群的区分是何情形。<br />不过，至于个体的每个社群，情况是这样：它是由在良善方面一致的众多天使组成的；这些良善各种各样，因为每位天使都有其特有的良善；但主将这些各种各样、彼此和谐一致的良善组织成这样一种形式：他们一起呈现为一个良善。这些社群就由以色列人当中的父家来代表。这就是以色列人不仅被划分为各个支派，还被划分为各个家族和家庭的原因。这也是为何当在圣言中，经上以名字提及他们时，也依次提及他们列祖的名字，甚至回到他们所属的支派。例如，经上论到撒母耳的父亲说，他来自以法莲山，“名叫以利加拿”，“是苏弗的玄孙、托户的曾孙、以利户的孙子、耶罗罕的儿子”（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上1.1.htm">1:1</a>）；还论到扫罗的父亲说，他来自便雅悯，“名叫基士，是便雅悯人亚斐亚的玄孙、比歌拉的曾孙、洗罗的孙子、亚别的儿子”（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上9.1.htm">9:1</a>）；以及关于许多其它父亲的类似细节。如此提及是为了叫天堂里的人知道这位父亲所代表的良善种类的具体性质，因为它是从第一种连续衍生而来的。<br />此外，天堂里的情形是这样：如果一个社群没有如它应该的那样完整，就会从别处，从某个邻近社群取新成员，所取数目刚好使该良善的形式完整起来。数目多寡取决于每个状态及其变化中的需要；因为良善的形式照状态的变化而各异。然而，要进一步知道，在第三层或至内层天堂（它在紧邻属灵天使所在的天堂之上，因为这些天使构成中间或第二层天堂），掌权的是纯真，因为作为完美纯真本身的主直接流入该天堂；但主与纯真间接，也就是经由第三层天堂流入第二层天堂，就是属灵天使所在的地方。<br />这种流注就是第二层天堂的社群照其良善被组织或排列成秩序所用的手段。因此，纯真的流注带来良善状态的变化，随之带来那里的社群彼此联结的变化。由此可见，当如何理解本节在内义上的内容，即：如果某人的特定类型的良善不足以满足纯真，与最近的真理之良善的联结就要得以实现，好使良善能得以填满，以足以满足纯真；用来填满良善的良善之真理，其数量要恰好满足吸收纯真的需要。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7836</b></p><p><b>7836.</b>
In the number of the souls, everyone for the month of his eating* shall ye count for the lamb. That this signifies thus the filling up of the good, conformably to the innocence, from so many truths of 
good, according to the appropriation of the innocence, is evident from the signification of "the number of the souls," as being so many truths of good, for "number" in the Word is predicated of truth, 
and "soul" of spiritual good; from the signification of "for the mouth of his eating," as being according to the appropriation of it (that "to eat" denotes appropriation, see n. 3168, 3513, 3596, 3832); 
and from the signification of a "lamb," as being innocence (n. 7832). The filling up of the good conformably to the innocence, is signified by "taking from the house of a near neighbor" such a number 
as may be sufficient for the lamb. (That "house" denotes good, see above, n. 7833.) It is said, "the truth of good," and by this is meant the truth which is from good. For when they who are of the 
spiritual church are being regenerated, they are introduced to the good of charity by means of the truth of faith; but when they have been introduced to the good which is of charity, the truths which 
are afterward born thence are called the "truths of good." [2] But how the case is with what is contained in this verse cannot possibly be known unless it is known how it is with the societies in 
heaven; for the consociations of the sons of Israel according to tribes, families, and houses represented these societies. With the societies in heaven the case is this. The universal heaven is one society, 
which is ruled by the Lord as one man; the general societies there are as many as are the members, the viscera, and the organs in man; but the specific societies are as many as are the little viscera 
contained within each viscus, member, and organ; and the particular societies are as many as in these little viscera there are lesser parts constituting a greater one. That this is the case is 
plain from the correspondences of man, and of his members, organs, and viscera, with the Grand Man, that is, with heaven, which has been treated of from experience at the end of many chapters. From all 
this it can be seen how the case is with the distinctions of societies in heaven. [3] But with each society in particular the case is this: it consists of many angels who are in agreement in respect 
to goods; these goods are various, for each angel has his peculiar good; but these various concordant goods are disposed by the Lord into such a form that together they present one good. Such societies 
were represented by the houses of the fathers among the sons of Israel. This is the reason why the sons of Israel were distinguished not only into tribes, but also into families and houses; and when 
they are mentioned, that the names of their fathers in order even to the tribe are mentioned; as of the father of Samuel, that he was of Mount Ephraim, whose "name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, 
the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph" (1 Sam. 1:1); also of the father of Saul, that he was "of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the 
son of Aphiah, the son of a man a Benjamite" (1 Sam. 9:1); and so of very many others. Such mention was made in order that in heaven might be known the quality of the good which, being successively 
derived from the first, was represented by the one spoken of. [4] Moreover, in heaven the case is this. If a society is not complete, as it should be, there are then taken from elsewhere, from some 
neighboring society, as many as will fill up the form of that good, according to the necessity in each state, and its changes; for the form of the good varies as the state is changed. But be it further 
known that in the third or inmost heaven, which is next above the heaven where the spiritual are (for these constitute the middle or second heaven), innocence reigns, because the Lord, who is innocence 
itself, flows in immediately into that heaven; whereas into the second heaven, where the spiritual are, the Lord flows in with innocence mediately, namely, through the third heaven. [5] This influx 
is that by which the societies in the second heaven are disposed or arranged in order according to their goods; and therefore the states of the good are changed according to the influx of innocence; 
and consequently the conjunctions of the societies there are varied. From all this it can be seen how is to be understood that which is in this verse in the internal sense, namely, that if the particular 
good of anyone is not sufficient for the innocence, conjunction shall be effected with the nearest good of truth, in order that the good may be filled up, conformably to the innocence, from so many 
truths of good, according to the appropriation of the innocence. * That is, the months were to be counted. [Reviser.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7836</b></p><p><b>7836.</b>
'By the number of the souls, [each of them] according to the mouth of his eating, you shall make your count for the member of the flock' means making the good sufficient for innocence by filling it out 
with truths of good in the exact quantity needed for assimilating innocence. This is clear from the meaning of 'the number of the souls' as the exact quantity of the truths of good, since 'the number' 
in the Word has reference to truth, and 'a soul' to spiritual good; from the meaning of according to the mouth of his eating' as the amount needed for assimilating it, 'eating' meaning assimilating 
or making one's own, see <a href="3168.htm">3168</a>, <a href="3517.htm">3517</a>, <a href="3596.htm">3596</a>, <a href="3832.htm">3832</a>; and from the meaning of 'the member of the flock' as innocence, dealt with above in <a href="7832.htm">7832</a> Making the good sufficient for innocence by filling it out is 
meant by the command to take from the house of an immediate neighbour the number that would be enough for the member of the flock, 'the house' meaning good, see above in <a href="7873.htm">7873</a>. When the expression 'the 
truth of good' is used here truth springing from good is meant. For when those who belong to the spiritual Church are being regenerated they are brought to the good of charity by means of the truth 
of faith; but once they have been brought to the good of charity, the truths born from it subsequently are called the truths of good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But how to understand these matters contained in this verse 
no one can possibly know unless he knows how the communities in heaven exist in relation to one another; for those communities were represented by the ways in which the children of Israel lived in association 
with one another according to tribes, families, and households. The communities of heaven are interrelated in a similar way, as follows: Heaven as a whole is one community, which the Lord governs 
as a single human being. The general communities there are the same in number as the members and various organs a person has, while the specific communities are the same in number as the component 
parts of each organ or member. And the individual communities are just so many as the smaller parts constituting larger ones. The truth of this is evident from the correspondences of the human being 
and of his members and various organs with the Grand Man, that is, with heaven, which have been described from experience at the ends of quite a number of chapters. From all this one may see what heaven 
is like so far as its organization into separate communities is concerned. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But as regards what each community individually is like, it consists of a large number of angels who accord with 
one another in their types of good. The types of good are varying, for each one's good is peculiar to himself; yet those varying types of good that are in accord with one another are organized by the 
Lord into the kind of form in which they stand together as a single body of good. Such communities were represented by the fathers' houses among the children of Israel. This is the reason why the children 
of Israel were divided not only into tribes but also into families and households. And it is also why, when people are mentioned by name [in the Word], the names of their fathers are mentioned in 
order, right back to the tribe they belong to. It says, for example, of Samuel's father in <a href="1.htm">1</a> Sam.l:1 that he was from Mount Ephraim, and that his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, 
the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph; and <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1%20Sam%209:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">1 Sam 9:1</a> states that Saul's father was from Benjamin, and that his name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, 
the son of a Jeminite man.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> Similar details concerning very many other fathers are given. When such were mentioned it was to the end that heaven might know the particular nature of the kind of good 
represented by that father, as it derived in consecutive degrees from the first.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In heaven furthermore, if a community is not complete as it ought to be, then new members are taken from elsewhere, 
from some neighbouring community, just the number that will complete the form of that good. As many are taken as are needed in each state and in the changes it undergoes; for the form of good varies 
as the state changes. It should nevertheless be recognized that in the third or inmost heaven - which is immediately above the heaven where those who are spiritual are, since these constitute the 
middle or second heaven - innocence reigns. For the Lord, who is perfect innocence, flows directly into that heaven.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 But in the second heaven, where those who are spiritual are, the Lord flows 
in with innocence indirectly, that is to say, by way of the third heaven. This inflow is the means by which the communities in the second heaven are organized or arranged into order in respect of their 
types of good. Therefore the inflow of innocence is what leads to changes in the states of good and to consequent variations of the patterns linking communities to one another there. From this it 
becomes clear how one ought to understand the contents of this verse in the internal sense, namely as follows: If someone's individual type of good is insufficient for innocence, it must be joined to 
the nearest good of truth, in order to make the good sufficient for the innocence by filling it out with truths of good in the exact quantity needed for assimilating innocence.

`In numero animarum, ad os comedere illius, numerabitis super pecudem': quod significet sic impletionem boni pro innocentia ex totidem veris boni secundum appropriationem ejus, constat ex significatione 
`numeri animarum' quod sint totidem vera boni; `numerus' enim in Verbo praedicatur de vero, et `anima' de bono spirituali; ex significatione `ad os comedere illius' quod sit secundum appropriationem 
ejus, quod `comedere' sit appropriatio, videatur n. 3168, 3513, 3596, 3832; et ex significatione `pecudis' quod sit innocentia, de qua supra n. 7832; impletio boni pro innocentia significatur per 
quod `ex domo vicini propinqui {1}acciperetur eo numero, ut satis {2}esset pro pecude'; quod `domus' sit bonum, videatur supra n. 7833.  Verum boni dicitur, et per id intelligitur verum quod ex bono, 
qui enim ab Ecclesia spirituali sunt, cum regenerantur, introducuntur ad bonum charitatis per verum fidei; cum autem introducti sunt ad bonum quod charitatis, vera quae inde postea nascuntur dicuntur 
vera boni. 	2 Sed quomodo haec quae in hoc versu continentur se habent, nequaquam sciri potest nisi sciatur quomodo se habet cum societatibus in caelo; {3}illas enim consociationes filiorum Israelis 
secundum tribus, familias, et {4}domos repraesentabant; cum societatibus in caelo ita se habet: universum caelum est una societas, quae sicut unus homo regitur a Domino; societates generales ibi sunt 
totidem quot membra, viscera, et organa in homine; societates autem speciales sunt totidem quot viscerula intra quodlibet contentum visceris, membri, {5}et organi; et societates particulares sunt quot 
in his sunt partes minores majorem constituentes; (m)quod ita sit, patet ex correspondentiis hominis et ejus membrorum, organorum, et viscerum cum Maximo Homine, hoc est, caelo, de quibus ab experientia 
ad finem plurium capitum actum est;(n) ex his constare potest quomodo se habet cum societatum distinctionibus in caelo. 	3 At cum unaquavis societate in particulari ita se habet: consistit illa ex 
pluribus angelis qui concordant quoad bona; bona sunt varia, nam unicuique peculiare bonum est; sed varia illa bona concordantia in formam talem a Domino disponuntur ut simul unum bonum sistant; tales 
societates repraesentabant domus patrum apud filios Israelis; haec causa est quod filii Israelis non solum in tribus distincti fuerint sed etiam in familias et domos; cumque nominantur, (quod nomina 
patrum illorum ordine usque ad tribum memorentur, sicut de patre Samuelis quod fuerit De monte Ephraim, cujus nomen Elkanah, filius Jerochami, filii Elihu, filii (x)Tochu, filii Zuph, 1 Sam. i 1; </p>

de patre Schaulis quod fuerit ex Benjamine, nomen ejus Kisch, filius Abiel, filii Zeror, filii Bechorath, filii Aphiach, filii viri Jeminitae, 1 Sam. ix 1; </p>
<p>ita de perpluribus aliis;) memoratio talis 
erat ut in caelo sciretur quale boni, quod ex primo successive derivatum, per illum repraesentabatur. 	4 Porro in caelo ita se habet: si societas non completa sit sicut debet, {6}quod tunc assumantur 
aliunde ex aliqua societate vicina, totidem ut impleant formam illius boni, secundum necessitatem in unoquovis statu et ejus mutationibus, nam variatur forma boni sicut mutatur status.  Sed adhuc 
sciendum quod in tertio seu intimo caelo, quod est proxime supra caelum ubi spirituales, hi enim medium seu' secundum caelum constituunt, regnet innocentia, nam Dominus, 5 Qui est Ipsa Innocentia, immediate 
in id caelum influit; at in caelum secundum, ubi spirituales, influit Dominus cum innocentia mediate, nempe per caelum tertium; hic influxus est per quem disponuntur seu ordinantur societates 
in secundo caelo quoad bona sua; quapropter secundum influxum innocentiae mutantur status boni, et consequenter variantur conjunctiones societatum ibi.  Ex his constare potest quomodo intelligenda quae 
in hoc versu in sensu interno sunt, nempe quod si bonum {7}particulare alicujus non satis sit pro innocentia, conjunctio fiet cum bono veri proximo, ut impleatur bonum pro innocentia ex totidem veris
