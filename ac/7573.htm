<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7573.</strong>“耶和华就发声”表与那些处于良善和真理之人的交流的撤回和中断。这从“声（音）”的含义清楚可知，“声（音），也就是打雷的声音，是指启示并完善天堂里的人，使地狱里的人受惊吓并荒凉的神之真理；它们因使后者荒凉，故表示与那些处于良善和真理之人的交流的撤回和中断，因为他们以这种方式被荒凉。至于这一切是如何发生的，这从前面（<a href="7502.htm">7502</a>，<a href="7541.htm">7541</a>，<a href="7542.htm">7542</a>，<a href="7545.htm">7545</a>，<a href="7554.htm">7554</a>节）所述明显可知，即：那些曾属于教会，并由此从圣言吸收真理和良善的认知，然而却过着邪恶生活的人，通过他们从世界，就是他们在教会所在的地方带来的真理和良善与天堂交流。一个人会将凡他在世上所知道，事实上所看见、听见、思想、谈论、意愿、行出的一切都带入来世（参看<a href="2474.htm">2474</a>，<a href="2475.htm">2475</a>，<a href="2481.htm">2481</a>-<a href="2486.htm">2486</a>，<a href="7398.htm">7398</a>节）。当他们正经历荒凉时，被夺走的，就是这种交流；当这种交流被夺走时，真理和良善，连同对它们的认知也一并被除去。因为凡灵人，甚至天使所知道的一切，皆从主经由天堂，因而通过交流流入（参看<a href="6053.htm">6053</a>-<a href="6058.htm">6058</a>，<a href="6189.htm">6189</a>-<a href="6215.htm">6215</a>，<a href="6307.htm">6307</a>-<a href="6327.htm">6327</a>，<a href="6466.htm">6466</a>-<a href="6495.htm">6495</a>，<a href="6613.htm">6613</a>-<a href="6626.htm">6626</a>节）。由此明显可知，与那些处于真理和良善之人的交流的撤回和中断是什么意思。神的真理（这真理由“声音”来表示）在天堂和地狱的情况，和地上的阵阵雷声一样。在高山上，雷声听上去就像温和轻柔的声音；但在下面的地上，它们听上去就像可怕的巨响。同样，神的真理在天堂是温和轻柔的，而在地狱是可怕的。<br />“声音”，也就是雷声表示启示并完善天堂里的人，使地狱里的人受惊吓并荒凉的神之真理，这一点从以下经文明显看出来：<br />心中喜乐，像人吹笛，上耶和华的山，到以色列的磐石那里。耶和华必使人听祂荣耀的声音，又使祂的膀臂看见平静；在忿怒的忿恨，并吞灭的火焰与霹雷、洪水、冰雹中。亚述人必因耶和华的声音惊惶。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.29.htm">30:29</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.31.htm">31</a>）<br />此处“耶和华的声音”表示神之真理，它启示并光照那些处于良善的人，使那些陷入邪恶的人受惊吓并荒凉。约珥书：<br />地在祂面前震动，日月昏暗，星宿也不发光；耶和华在祂军旅前发声，祂的营地甚大；成就祂话语的，不可胜数；因为耶和华的日子大而可畏。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.10.htm">2:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.11.htm">11</a>）<br />此处的意思也一样。<br />同一先知书：<br />耶和华必从锡安吼叫，从耶路撒冷发声；天地都要震动；耶和华却要作祂百姓的避难所，作以色列人的保障。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥3.16.htm">3:16</a>）<br />此处“耶和华的声音”同样表示神之真理；经上之所以说“从耶路撒冷”，是因为“耶路撒冷”表示主的属灵国度，就是那些从真理处于良善，从良善处于真理的人所住的国度。<br />诗篇：<br />耶和华也在天上的打雷，至高者发出声音，便有冰雹火炭；祂射出箭来，使他们四散；多多发出闪电，使他们扰乱。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗18.13.htm">18:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗18.14.htm">14</a>）<br />“发出声音”、“冰雹”和“火炭”表示真理和良善通过虚假和恶欲而荒凉。<br />云中倒出水来，天空发出声音，你的箭也射出云，你的雷声响彻大地，闪电照亮世界。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗77.17.htm">77:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗77.18.htm">18</a>）<br />“声音”表示启示那些属教会之人的神之真理。<br /><br />耶和华的声音发在水上，荣耀的神打雷，耶和华在大水之上；耶和华的声音大有能力；耶和华的声音满有威严。耶和华的声音震破香柏树，耶和华打碎黎巴嫩的香柏树；耶和华的声音使火焰分岔；耶和华的声音震动旷野；耶和华的声音心动母鹿落胎，使森林脱落净光。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗29.3.htm">29:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗29.9.htm">9</a>）<br />此处“耶和华的声音”表示神的真理和它所拥有的能力，因而也表示圣言，因为圣言是神的真理。<br />启示录：<br />一位大力的天使降下，大声呼喊，呼喊完了，就有七雷发声。我正要写出来，就听见从天上有声音对我说，七雷所说的事你要封上，不可写出来。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启10.1.htm">10:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启10.3.htm">3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启10.4.htm">4</a>）<br />“声音”表示神的真理；“雷声”表示那些传达真理，并把它从天上带到地上的人。谁都能看出，“雷声”和“声音”表示神性事物，而不指雷声和声音；由于它们表示神性事物，被称为“耶和华的声音”，故显而易见，它们是指神性真理。这就是为何当耶和华降临西乃山，宣告神性真理时，有声音，有闪电，有雷轰（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出19.16.htm">19:16</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出20.18.htm">20:18</a>）；并且祂从火中说话（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申4.11.htm">4:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申4.12.htm">12</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申5.22.htm">5:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申5.25.htm">25</a>）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7573</b></p><p><b>7573.</b>
And Jehovah gave voices of thunder. That this signifies the withdrawal and separation of the communication with those who are in good and truth is evident from the signification of the "voices," which 
are those of thunders, as being truths Divine that enlighten and perfect those who are in heaven, and that terrify and devastate those who are in hell; and because they devastate these latter, they 
signify the withdrawal and separation of the communication of those who are in good and truth, for in this way they are devastated. How this takes place is plain from what was said before (n. 7502, 7541, 
7542, 7545, 7554), namely, that they who have been of the church, and from this have imbibed knowledges of truth and good from the Word, but have lived a life of evil, have communication with heaven 
through the truths and goods which they have brought with them from the world by having been in the church (that a man brings with him in the other life whatever he has known in the world, nay, whatever 
he has seen, heard, thought, spoken, willed, and done, see n. 2474, 2475, 2481-2486, 7398). This is the communication which is taken away when they are being devastated; and when this communication 
has been taken away, then also the truths and goods together with the knowledges thereof have also been taken away. For whatever is known by spirits, nay, by the angels, flows in through heaven from 
the Lord, thus by means of communications (see n. 6053-6058, 6189-6215, 6307-6327, 6466-6495, 6613-6626). From all this it is evident what is meant by the withdrawal and separation of the communication 
with those who are in truth and good. As regards truth Divine in heaven and in hell, which truth is signified by the "voices," the case is the same as it is with thunders on earth. On high mountains 
thunders are heard as a mild and gentle sound, whereas below on the earth they are heard as a terrific noise; and in the same way in heaven truth Divine is mild and gentle, but in hell is terrible. [2] 
That "voices" which are thunders signify truths Divine that enlighten and perfect those who are in heaven, and that terrify and devastate those who are in hell, is plain from the following passages: </p>
<p> 
    There shall be joy of heart; as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountains of Jehovah, unto the Rock of Israel; then shall Jehovah cause the glory of His voice to be heard, and 
shall make His arm see rest; in the indignation of anger, and the flame of a devouring fire, in scattering, and in inundation, and in hailstone. For by the voice of Jehovah shall Asshur be dismayed (Isa. 
30:29-31); </p>
<p>here "the voice of Jehovah" denotes truth Divine, which enlightens and perfects those who are in good, and terrifies and devastates those who are in evil. In Joel: </p>
<p>     The earth quaked 
before Him, the sun and the moon were blackened, and the stars withdrew their shining; and Jehovah uttered His voice before His army, His camp is very great; for numberless is he that doeth His word; 
for the day of Jehovah is great and very terrible (Joel 2:10-11); </p>
<p>where the meaning is similar. [3] In the same: </p>
<p>     Jehovah shall roar from Zion, and shall utter His voice from Jerusalem; and 
the heavens and the earth shall shake; but Jehovah shall be a refuge for His people, and a stronghold to the sons of Israel (Joel 3:16). Here in like manner the "voice of Jehovah" denotes truth Divine; 
that it is said to be "from Jerusalem" is because by "Jerusalem" is signified the Lord's spiritual kingdom, in which are they who are in good from truth, and in truth from good. [4] In David: </p>
<p>   
  Jehovah thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered His voice, hailstone and coals of fire; so that He sent out His arrows and scattered them; and many thunderbolts, and troubled them (Ps. 18:13-14); </p>
<p>"to 
utter His voice," "hailstone," and "coals of fire," denote the devastation of truth and good through falsities, and the evils of cupidities. In the same: </p>
<p>     The clouds dropped waters, 
the skies uttered a voice, Thine arrows also went abroad, the voice of Thy thunder into the world, the lightnings lightened the world (Ps. 77:17-18); </p>
<p>"a voice" denotes truth Divine, which enlightens 
those who are of the church. [5] In the same: </p>
<p>     The voice of Jehovah is upon the waters, the God of glory thundereth, even Jehovah upon great waters: the voice of Jehovah is in power: the voice 
of Jehovah is with honor: the voice of Jehovah breaketh the cedars, Jehovah hath broken in pieces the cedars of Lebanon: the voice of Jehovah cleaveth as flames of fire: the voice of Jehovah maketh the 
wilderness to tremble: the voice of Jehovah maketh the hinds to calve, and strippeth the forests (Ps. 29:3-9); </p>
<p>here "the voice of Jehovah" denotes truth Divine and its power, thus also the Word, because 
this is truth Divine. [6] In John: </p>
<p>     A strong angel coming down cried with a great voice, and when he cried the seven thunders uttered their voices. I was about to write, but I heard a voice 
from heaven saying to me, Seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not (Rev. 10:1, 3-4); </p>
<p>"voices" denote truth Divine; "thunders," those who carry it and bring it from heaven 
to earth. Everyone can see that by "thunders" and "voices" are signified Divine things, not thunders and sounds; and because they signify Divine things, and are called "the voices of Jehovah," it 
is evident that they denote Divine truth. It was for this reason that when Jehovah descended upon Mount Sinai and promulgated Divine truth there were voices, lightnings, and thunders (Exod. 19:16; 20:18); 
and He spoke out of the midst of the fire (Deut. 4:11-12; 5:22-25). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7573</b></p><p><b>7573.</b>
'And Jehovah gave forth voices' means the departure and severance of communication with those governed by good and guided by truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'voices', which are claps of thunder, 
as God's truths which enlighten and perfect those in heaven, but frighten those in hell and subject them to vastation; and since they devastate the latter they mean the departure and severance of 
communication with those governed by good and guided by truth, this being the way in which they are devastated. The situation in all this is evident from what has been stated already in <a href="7502.htm">7502</a>, <a href="7541.htm">7541</a>, <a href="7542.htm">7542</a>, <a href="7545.htm">7545</a>, <a href="7554.htm">7554</a>. In these places it was shown that those who have belonged to the Church and consequently absorbed cognitions of truth and good from the Word, yet have led an evil life, have a line of 
communication with heaven through the truths and forms of good which they have brought with them from their time in the world, where they were in the Church. (A person brings with him into the next life 
whatever he knew in the world, indeed whatever he saw, heard, thought, spoke, willed, or did, see <a href="2474.htm">2474</a>, <a href="2475.htm">2475</a>, <a href="2481.htm">2481</a>-<a href="2486.htm">2486</a>, <a href="7398.htm">7398</a>). This communication is what is taken away when they undergo vastation; 
and when communication has been taken away, so are truths and forms of good, and cognitions of them, removed. For whatever spirits, and indeed angels know flows in from the Lord by way of heaven, thus 
through communications that are made, see <a href="6053.htm">6053</a>-<a href="6058.htm">6058</a>, <a href="6180.htm">6180</a>, <a href="6215.htm">6215</a>, <a href="6307.htm">6307</a>-<a href="6717.htm">6717</a>, <a href="6466.htm">6466</a>-<a href="6495.htm">6495</a>, <a href="6613.htm">6613</a>-<a href="6626.htm">6626</a>. All this shows what is meant by a departure and severance of communication with those who are guided 
by truth and governed by good. The situation with God's truth in heaven and in hell - the truth that is meant by 'voices' - is like that with claps of thunder on earth. On high mountains claps of thunder 
are heard as no more than a gentle, quiet sound; but on the land lying below they are heard as a frightening crash. In the same way God's truth in heaven is gentle and mild, whereas in hell it is 
frightening. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The meaning of 'voices', which are claps of thunder, as God's truths that enlighten and perfect those in heaven, and that frighten those in hell and subject them to vastation, is 
evident from the following places: In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
You will have joy of heart, as when one marches with a pipe to come to the mountain of Jehovah, to the Rock of Israel. Then Jehovah will cause His glorious 
voice<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> to be heard, and will cause His arm to see repose, in the indignation of [His] anger, and the flame of a devouring fire, [in] scattering, and deluging, and hailstones. For by the voice of 
Jehovah Asshur will be dismayed. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2030:29-31&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 30:29-31</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the voice of Jehovah' stands for God's truth which enlightens and perfects those who are governed by good but frightens those under the influence 
of evil and subjects them to vastation. In Joel, </p>
<blockquote>
The earth quaked before Him, the sun and moon were darkened, and the stars withdrew their shining; and Jehovah uttered His voice before His army, 
His camp is exceedingly great; for that which executes His word is uncountable. For great is the day of Jehovah, and extremely frightening. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%203:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 3:16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the meaning is similar. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the 
same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah will roar from Zion, and from Jerusalem will give forth His voice; and the heavens and the earth will be shaken. But Jehovah will be a shelter for His people, and a fortification 
for the children of Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%203:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 3:16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The voice of Jehovah' likewise stands for God's truth. It is given forth 'from Jerusalem' because that city means the Lord's spiritual kingdom, inhabited 
by those who are moved by truth to be governed by good and moved by good to be guided by truth.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah thundered in the heavens, and the Most High gave forth His voice, hail, and 
coals of fire, so that He sent His arrows and scattered them, and many thunder-bolts, and threw them into confusion. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2018:13,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 18:13, 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Giving forth voice, hail, and coals of fire' stands for the devastation 
of truth and good by means of falsities and evil desires. In the same author,  </p>
<blockquote>
The clouds dropped water, the skies gave voice, also Your arrows went out, the voice of Your thunder into the 
earth; the lightnings lit up the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2077:16-18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 77:16-18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'A voice' stands for God's truth which enlightens those who belong to the Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
The voice of Jehovah is upon 
the waters, the God of glory causes it to thunder, Jehovah is over great waters; the voice of Jehovah is powerful; the voice of Jehovah is majestic; the voice of Jehovah breaks the cedars, Jehovah breaks 
to pieces the cedars of Lebanon; the voice of Jehovah strikes as flames of fire; the voice of Jehovah causes the wilderness to shake; the voice of Jehovah causes the hinds to calve, and strips the 
forests bare. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2029:3-11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 29:3-11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the voice of Jehovah' stands for God's truth and the power it has. Thus it also stands for the Word since this is God's truth.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In John, </p>
<blockquote>
A mighty angel coming 
down called out with a loud voice; and when he called out, seven thunders uttered their voices. I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Seal up the things which the seven 
thunders uttered, and do not write them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2010:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 10:3, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Voices' stands for God's truth, 'thunders' for those who convey it, bringing it from heaven to earth. No one can fail to see that 'thunders 
and 'voices' mean things that are Divine, not thunders and crashes. And since they mean Divine things and are called Jehovah's voices it is evident that they are Divine Truth. This was why, when Jehovah 
came down on Mount Sinai and proclaimed Divine Truth, there were voices, lightnings, and thunders, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2019:16;%2020:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 19:16; 20:18</a>, and why He spoke out of the midst of the fire, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%204:11,%2012;%205:22-24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 4:11, 12; 5:22-24</a>.

illustrant et perficiunt illos qui in caelo, et quae terrificant et devastant illos qui in inferno, patet ab his locis: apud Esaiam, Erit gaudium cordis, sicut incedentis cum fistula ad veniendum in 
montem Jehovae ad petram Israelis, tunc audiri faciet Jehovah gloriam vocis suae, et quietem brachium Ipsius videre faciet; in indignatione irae, et flamma ignis comedentis, dispersione, et inundatione, 
et lapide grandinis, nam a voce Jehovae consternabitur Aschur, xxx 30, 31; </p>
<p>hic `vox Jehovae' pro vero Divino quod illustrat et perficit illos qui in bono, (c)ac terrificat (c)et devastat illos qui 
in malo: apud Joelem, Coram Ipso commota est terra, sol et luna atrati sunt, et stellae contraxerunt splendorem suum; et Jehovah edit vocem Suam coram exercitu Suo, magna valde castra Ipsius, quia

apud eundem, Stillarunt aquas nubes, vocem dederunt aetheres, etiam tela Tua iverunt, vox tonitru Tui in orbem, illustrarunt fulgura orbem, Ps. lxxvii 17-19 [A.V. 16-18]; </p>
<p>`vox' pro vero Divino 
quod illustrat illos qui ab Ecclesia: apud 5 eundem, Vox Jehovae super aquis, Deus gloriae tonare facit, Jehovah super aquis magnis: vox Jehovae in virtute: vox Jehovae cum honore: vox Jehovae frangens 
cedros, confregit Jehovah cedros Libani: vox Jehovae incidens flammae ignis: vox Jehovae trepidare facit desertum: vox Jehovae parturire facit cervas, et denudat silvas, Ps. xxix 3-11; </p>
<p>ibi `vox Jehovae' 
pro vero Divino ac illius potentia; ita quoque pro 6 Verbo, nam hoc est verum Divinum: apud Johannem, Angelus fortis descendens, clamavit voce magna; et cum clamavit, locuta sunt septem tonitrua 
voces suas; scripturus eram, sed audivi vocem e caelo dicentem mihi, Obsigna quae locuta septem tonitrua, et haec ne scribas, Apoc. x 3, 4; </p>
<p>`voces' pro vero Divino, `tonitrua' pro vehentibus illud, 
et ferentibus e caelo {9}in terram.  Quod per `tonitrua et voces' significentur Divina, non tonitrua et {10}sonitus, nemo non videre potest, et quia Divina significant ac `Jehovae voces' vocantur, 
patet quod sint Divinum Verum; inde erat cum Jehovah descendit super monte Sinai, ac Divinum Verum promulgavit, quod `essent voces, fulmina, et tonitrua,' Exod. xix 16, xx 15; et quod `locutus sit e medio 
ignis,' Deut. iv 11, 12, v 19-22. 	@1 adempta$ 	@2 et illorum cognitiones ademptae$ 	@3 i enim$ 	@4 i 6598-6126,$ 	@5 bono et vero$ 	@6 After significatur$ 	@7 seu$ 	@8 sicut$ 	@9 ad$ 	@10
