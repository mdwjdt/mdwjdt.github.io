<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6415节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6415.</strong>从以色列在关于但、迦得、亚设、拿弗他利的这些预言中所说的话很清楚地看出内义的存在，没有这内义，人几乎什么也不明白，不知道真正的含义。如“但必作道上的蛇，路中的箭蛇，咬伤马蹄，使骑马的向后坠落”；“必有敌军毁坏迦得，他必毁坏脚跟”；“亚设的食物必定肥美；他必出君王的美味”；“拿弗他利是被释放的母鹿；他出嘉美的言语”。没有内义所提供的钥匙，谁能知道这些话是什么意思？它们并非指着雅各的儿子们，或各支派说的；这一点可从以下事实看出来：像这样的事在“末后之日”无一临到他们；然而，以色列却说他要把他们末后之日必遇的事告诉他们（49:1）。由于他的话不是指着他们说的，故可知，这些话是指着诸如他们所代表的那类事物说的。这些事物的性质已经在前文解释过了。</p>

From what was said by Israel in this prophetic utterance about Dan, Gad, Asher, and Naphtali, it is very plain that there is an internal sense and that without this sense scarcely anything can be understood 
and known; such as that "Dan shall be a serpent upon the way, an arrow-snake upon the path, biting the horse's heels, and that his rider shall fall backward;" that "a troop shall ravage Gad, and 
he shall ravage the heel;" that "Asher's bread shall be fat, and he shall give the delights of a king;" and that "Naphtali is a hind let loose, giving discourses of elegance." Who without the key from 
the internal sense can know what these things mean? That they were not said of the sons of Jacob, nor of the tribes, may be seen from the fact that nothing of the kind here described befell them in 
the "end of days," when yet Israel says that he would tell them what should then befall them (verse 1); and as they were not said of them, it follows that they were said of such things as are represented 
by them, the nature of which has been unfolded above. </p>

From the things stated by Israel in these prophetic utterances concerning Dan, Gad, Asher, and Naphtali the existence of an internal sense is plainly evident, as is the fact that without that sense one 
can scarcely understand anything or know what is really meant. How does one understand for example the statements 'Dan will be a serpent on the road, a darting serpent on the path, biting the horse's 
heels; and its rider will fall backwards', 'a troop will ravage Gad, and he will ravage the heel', 'fat will be Asher's bread, and he will yield a king's delights', or 'Naphtali is a hind let loose, 
making elegant utterances'? Who can know what these statements mean without the key provided by the internal sense? They are not really things said about the sons of Jacob, or about the tribes, as becomes 
clear from the fact that nothing like those things happened to them 'at the end of days', even though Israel says in verse 1 that he will tell them what is going to happen to them at that time. 
And since what he said was not really about them it follows that he spoke about things such as were represented by them. The nature of those things has been explained above in what has gone before. </p>

Ex illis quae in hoc prophetico de Dane, Gade, Ashere,et Naphtali, ab Israele dicta sunt, patet manifeste quod sensus internus sit, et quod absque {1}sensu interno vix aliquid intelligi queat (c)et 
sciri quid sit, sicut quod `Dan serpens super via, serpens jaculus super semita, mordens calcaneos equi, cadet eques ejus retrorsum':  quod `turma depopulabitur Gadem, et is depopulabitur calcaneum': 
 quod `Asheri pinguis erit panis, et is dabit delicias regis:  et quod `Naphtali cerva dimissa, dans sermones elegantiae':  quis illa {2}scire potest quid sint, absque clave ex sensu interno; quod non 
de {3}filiis Jacobi dicta sint, nec de tribubus, constare potest ex eo quod nihil tale illis contigerit in postremitate dierum; cum tamen `Israel dicit' quod indicaret quid (t)illis tunc continget, vers. 
1; et quia non de illis, sequitur quod de talibus dicta sint, quae per illos repraesentantur; quae qualia sunt, in praecedentibus explicatum est. @1 illo sensu$ @2 nosse$ @3 illis$ </p>
