<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8063节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8063.</strong>“在你四境之内”表在源于良善的真理范围之内。这从“四境”的含义清楚可知，“四境”或边界是指源于良善的真理的范围。因为每一个真理都有自己的范畴，这有时通过一个气场表现出来；它因有自己的范围，故有自己的“四境”或边界。属于真理范围的气场取决于良善的质和量；因为良善就像一团火焰，而真理就像这团火焰发出的光。在灵界，一个气场能延伸到周围的社群；它的范围决定了那里交流的范围（参看<a href="6598.htm">6598</a>-<a href="6613.htm">6613</a>节）。在天堂，每个人都照着延伸的气场，也就是照着它的力量，同时照着它的品质而拥有聪明、智慧，以及幸福。由此可见，“在你四境之内”在灵义上表示什么，即在此表示良善必没有任何虚假在里面。因为虚假在气场之外，它们始于真理消失之地。它们即便进入气场，也会被同化。“在你四境之内不可见有发酵之物在你那里，也不可见有酵在你那里”就表示它们不可进入。</p>

In all thy border. That this signifies so far as the truth which is from good extends itself, is evident from the signification of "border," as being the extension of truth from good; for all truth has 
its extension, which is sometimes manifested by a sphere; and because it has extension, it has its borders. The sphere of the extension of truth is according to the quality and the amount of good; 
for good is like flame, and truth is like light. The sphere of extension in the spiritual world is to the societies which are round about; and so far as the sphere extends into them, so far there is communication 
(see n. 6598-6613). In heaven everyone has intelligence and wisdom, and has happiness, according to the sphere of extension; that is, according to its amount and at the same time its quality. 
From all this it can be seen what is signified in the spiritual sense by "in all thy border," here, that in good there must not be any falsity; for falsities are outside of the sphere, because they 
begin where truths leave off; whereas if they enter the sphere, they are appropriated. That they must not enter is signified by its being said "there shall no leavened thing, or leaven, be seen with 
thee in all thy border." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8063</b></p><p><b>8063.</b>
'Within all your borders' means within the range of truth that springs from good. This is clear from the meaning of 'borders' as the range of truth springing from good. For every truth has its own range, 
which is sometimes manifested in a sphere; and because it has its own range it has its own 'borders'. The sphere belonging to the range of truth is subject to the nature and amount of good, for good 
is like a flame and truth like the light from it. In the spiritual world a sphere extends to communities round about, and its range determines the range of communication there, see <a href="6598.htm">6598</a>-<a href="6613.htm">6613</a>. Everyone 
in heaven has intelligence and wisdom, also happiness, in proportion to that extending sphere, that is, in proportion to the strength and at the same time the character of it. From this one may see 
what 'in all the borders' means in the spiritual sense, here that good must have nothing false within it. For false ideas lie outside the sphere; they begin where the truths leave off. But if they 
enter the sphere they are assimilated. The idea that they must not enter is meant by the words 'nothing made with yeast shall be seen among you' nor 'yeast within all your borders'. </p>

</p><b>8063.</b>
`In omni termino tuo': quod significet quousque se extendit verum quod ex bono, constat ex significatione `termini' quod sit extensio veri a bono; omne enim verum suam extensionem habet, quae extensio 
quandoque manifestatur per sphaeram; et quia habet extensionem, habet suos terminos; sphaera extensionis veri est secundum quale et quantum boni; est enim bonum sicut flamma ac verum sicut lux {1}; 
sphaera extensionis in spirituali mundo est ad societates quae circumcirca; quousque ibi se extendit sphaera eo usque est communicatio, de {2}hoc videatur n. 6598-6613.  Secundum sphaeram extensionis 
{3} in caelo (t)est cuivis intelligentia et sapientia, et est felicitas, nempe secundum {4}quantum et simul quale ejus.  Ex his constare potest quid per `in omni termino' in sensu spirituali significatur, 
hic quod (5}in bono non aliquid falsum; falsa enim sunt extra sphaeram, nam excipiunt ubi vera desinunt, at si intrant sphaeram, tunc appropriantur; quod non intrabunt, significatur per quod `non 
videbitur tibi fermentatum aut fermentum in omni termino tuo.' 	@1 i supra$ 	@2 vera et purificari$ 	@3 status plenus et involvat sancta, ut quoque$ 	@4 at$ 	@5 i et bonum$ </p>
