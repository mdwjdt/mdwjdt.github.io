<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5205节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5205.</strong>“站在河岸上那其它母牛旁边”表它们在真理所在的边界。这从“站在河岸上”和“母牛”的含义清楚可知：“站在河岸上”是指在边界，“河”是指边界（参看<a href="5196.htm">5196</a>，<a href="5197.htm">5197</a>节）；“母牛”是指属世层的真理，如前所述（<a href="5198.htm">5198</a>节）。其中的情形，即虚假站在真理所在的边界上，从下文，尤其等到我们解释埃及地的七个荒年在内义上表示什么，以及七只长相丑陋、肌肉干瘦的母牛和又细弱又被东风吹焦的七个穗子预言和表示什么时明显看出来。</p>

And stood by the kine upon the bank of the river. That this signifies that they were in the boundaries where truths were, is evident from the signification of "standing by upon the bank of the river," 
as being in the boundaries (that a "river" is a boundary, see above, n. 5196, 5197); and from the signification of "kine," as being truths of the natural (of which also above, n. 5198). How the case 
herein is, that falsities stood in the boundaries where truths were, will appear from what follows, specifically when we come to unfold what is signified in the internal sense by the seven years of famine 
in the land of Egypt, predicted and signified by the seven kine evil in look and thin in flesh, and also by the seven ears of corn thin and blasted with the east wind. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5205</b></p><p><b>5205.</b>
'And stood by the [other] cows on the bank of the river' means at the boundaries where the truths were present. This is clear from the meaning of 'standing by, on the bank of the river' as at the boundaries, 
'the river' meaning a boundary, see <a href="5196.htm">5196</a>, <a href="5197.htm">5197</a>; and from the meaning of 'the cows' as the truths belonging to the natural, dealt with above in <a href="5198.htm">5198</a>. The implications of this - of falsities standing 
at the boundaries where truths were - will be evident from what appears further on, in particular at the point where the meaning in the internal sense of the seven years of famine in the land of 
Egypt comes up for explanation, those seven years being foretold and meant by the seven cows that were bad in appearance and thin-fleshed, and also by the seven heads of grain that were thin and scorched 
by an east wind. </p>

`Et steterunt juxta vaccas super ripa fluvii': quod significet quod in terminis ubi vera, constat ex significatione `stare juxta {1} super ripa fluvii' quod sit in terminis; quod `fluvius' sit terminus, 
videatur n. 5196, 5197; et ex significatione `vaccarum' quod sint vera naturalis, de qua supra n. 5198. Quomodo cum his se habet, nempe quod falsa steterint in terminis ubi vera, ex sequentibus patebit, 
in specie ubi explicandum venit quid in sensu interno significatur per `septem annorum famem in terra Aegypti', quae praedicta et significata fuit per `septem vaccas malas aspectu et graciles 
carne', tum per `septem aristas graciles et exustas euro'. @1 i et$ </p>
