<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8983节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8983.</strong>“这个女人和她的孩子要归他的主人”表被属灵层附于真理的良善，以及从这良善衍生而来的真理和良善必不归于真理当作它自己的。这从“女人”、“孩子”和“要归他的主人”的含义清楚可知：“女人”是指争战期间被附于真理的属灵良善，如前所述（<a href="8981.htm">8981</a>节）；“孩子”是指衍生的真理和良善，如刚才所述（<a href="8982.htm">8982</a>节）；“要归他的主人”是指它们必属于它们所源自的属灵层，而不属于真理。因为“主人”是指属灵层（<a href="8981.htm">8981</a>节），“奴仆”是指没有相应良善的真理（<a href="8974.htm">8974</a>节），这就是为何这些事物必不归于这真理。“男人和女人”在内义上表示真理与真理的结合，因为世上的婚姻代表天上的婚姻，也就是良善与真理的婚姻；此外，婚姻之爱对应于这婚姻（<a href="2727.htm">2727</a>-<a href="2759.htm">2759</a>，<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>节）。<br />不过，一个奴仆和他主人所给他的一个女人之间是没有婚姻的，只有一种像男人与妾那样的结合，这种结合不与天上的婚姻相对应。因此，当奴仆出去时，这种结合就终止了；因为这时女人和孩子都成了主人的了。这种结合之所以会发生，是因为“奴仆”所代表的真理存在于外在人中，而“女人”所代表的良善存在于内在人中；属于内在人的良善无法与属于外在人的真理结合，除非结合先在内在人中实现。在此之前，它们无法结合在一起，因为奴仆代表纯粹的外在人，这外在人没有相应的良善，并且这良善也无法被归与它。从前面关于人之重生的说明（<a href="3321.htm">3321</a>，<a href="3469.htm">3469</a>，<a href="3493.htm">3493</a>，<a href="3573.htm">3573</a>，<a href="3616.htm">3616</a>，<a href="3882.htm">3882</a>，<a href="4353.htm">4353</a>节）可以看出，内在人的良善与外在人的真理如何不可能结合在一起，除非结合先在内在人中实现；因为重生就是良善与真理的结合。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8983</b></p><p><b>8983.</b>
The woman and her children shall be his master's. That this signifies that good adjoined to truth by the spiritual, together with the truths and goods thence derived, shall not be appropriated to truth, 
is evident from the signification of "the woman," as being spiritual good adjoined to truth when in combat (of which above, n. 8981); from the signification of "children," as being derived truths 
and goods (of which just above, n. 8982); and from the signification of "shall be his master's," as being that they shall belong to the spiritual from which they are, and not to truth (for "the master" 
denotes the spiritual, n. 8981, and "the manservant," truth without the corresponding good, n. 8974; consequently that they shall not be appropriated to this truth). For in the internal sense by "man 
and woman" is signified the conjunction of truth and good, because marriage on earth represents the heavenly marriage which is that of good and truth; and moreover conjugial love corresponds to this 
marriage (n. 2727-2759, 2803). [2] But between a manservant and a woman given him by his master there is no marriage, but only a coupling like that of a concubine with a man, which coupling does not 
correspond to the heavenly marriage; and therefore it is dissolved when the manservant goes forth, for then the woman together with the children become the master's. The reason why such a coupling takes 
place, is that the truth which is represented by the manservant is in the external man, and the good which is represented by the woman is in the internal man; and the good of the internal man cannot 
be conjoined with the truth of the external unless conjunction has been previously effected in the internal man. This cannot be done, because the manservant represents the merely external man who has 
not the corresponding good, and to whom it cannot be appropriated. That the good of the internal man cannot be conjoined with the truth of the external unless conjunction has been first effected in 
the internal man, can be seen from what has been already said about the regeneration of man (n. 3321, 3469, 3493, 3573, 3616, 3882, 4353); for regeneration is the conjunction of good and truth. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8983</b></p><p><b>8983.</b>
'The woman and her children shall be her master's' means that the good attached by the spiritual to truth, and the truths and the forms of good derived from that good, must not be assigned to truth as 
its own. This is clear from the meaning of 'the woman' as spiritual good attached to truth during conflict, dealt with above in <a href="8981.htm">8981</a>; from the meaning of 'the children' as derived truths and forms of 
good, dealt with immediately above in <a href="8982.htm">8982</a>; and from the meaning of 'shall be her master's' as that they must belong to the spiritual from which they spring, and not to truth. For 'the master' is the 
spiritual, <a href="8981.htm">8981</a>, and 'the slave' is truth without complementary good, <a href="8974.htm">8974</a>, which is why those things must not be assigned to this truth. 'Man and woman' in the internal sense means good and truth joined 
together; for marriage on earth represents the heavenly marriage, which is that of good and truth, and also conjugial love corresponds to this marriage, <a href="2727.htm">2727</a>-<a href="2759.htm">2759</a>, <a href="2803.htm">2803</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But between a slave 
and a woman provided by his master there is no marriage, only a coupling together like that of man and concubine; and this coupling does not correspond to the heavenly marriage. Therefore also it is 
dissolved when the slave goes out; for then the woman and children become the master's. The reason why their relationship is only a coupling is that the truth represented by 'the slave' exists in the 
external man, while the good represented by 'the woman' exists in the internal man; and the good belonging to the internal man cannot be joined to the truth belonging to the external man unless a joining 
together has taken place first in the internal man. Till then they cannot be joined together because the slave represents the merely external man, which does not possess compatible good and cannot 
have such assigned to it. What has been stated about human regeneration in <a href="3321.htm">3321</a>, <a href="3469.htm">3469</a>, <a href="3493.htm">3493</a>, <a href="3573.htm">3573</a>, <a href="3616.htm">3616</a>, <a href="3882.htm">3882</a>, <a href="4353.htm">4353</a>, shows how impossible it is for the good of the internal man to be joined to the 
truth of the external man unless a joining together has taken place first in the internal man; for regeneration involves the joining together of goodness and truth. </p>

`Mulier et nati hujus erit domino ejus': quod significet {1}quod bonum vero a spirituali adjunctum cum veris et bonis inde derivatis non vero erit appropriatum, constat ex significatione `mulieris' 
quod sit bonum spirituale vero adjunctum cum in pugna, de qua supra n. 8981,{2} ex significatione `natorum' quod sint vera et bona derivata, de qua mox supra n. (x)8982, et ex significatione `erit domino 
ejus' quod sit quod {3}pertinebunt ad spirituale a quo, et non ad verum, `dominus' enim est spirituale, n. 8981, et `servus' verum absque bono correspondente, n. 8974, proinde quod non erunt huic 
vero appropriata; nam per `virum et mulierem' in sensu interno significatur conjunctio veri et boni, conjugium enim in {4}terris (x)repraesentat conjugium caeleste, quod est boni et veri, et quoque amor 
conjugialis correspondet illi conjugio, n. 2727-2759, 2803; at inter servum et 2 mulierem a domino suo datam non est conjugium, sed copulatio qualis concubinae cum viro, quae copulatio non correspondet 
conjugio caelesti, quapropter etiam solvitur cum servus exit, {5}nam tunc' mulier cum natis {6} fit domini; causa quod talis copulatio {7}sit, est quia verum quod per `servum' repraesentatur est 
in externo homine, et bonum quod per `mulierem' est in interno; et bonum interni hominis non potest cum vero externi conjungi nisi {8}prius conjunctio facta sit in interno; hoc non fieri potest, quia 
servus repraesentat mere externum hominem cui bonum (x)correspondens non est nec appropriari potest; quod bonum interni hominis non possit cum vero externi conjungi (m)nisi prius conjunctio facta sit 
in interno, constare potest ex illis quae de regeneratione hominis n. 3321, 3469, 3493, 3573, 3616 3882, 4353, dicta sunt, nam regeneratio est conjunctio boni et veri.(n)  @1 A first had quod bona...erunt 
appropriata then bona was altered to bonum but erunt appropriata remained unaltered.IT here read quod bonum... erunt appropriata but cp n. 8973.$ @2 i et$ @3 pertinebunt ad bonum spirituale a
