<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2349节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2349.</strong>“从最外面来的所有人”表它们中的每一个。这从刚才所述清楚可知，即“少”与“老”表新近和被确认的假与恶，故此处“从最外面来的人”表它们中的每一个。而且，“人”（people）这个词一般表虚假（参看<a href="1259.htm">1259</a>，<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>节）。<br />此处描述了那些反对仁之善，因而反对主（因为一个必牵涉另一个）的教会中人；若不通过爱与仁，没人能与主结合。爱是属灵的结合本身，这从爱的本质可以看出来；凡不与主结合的，也不会承认祂。他们若不处于良善，就不可能承认主，即信祂，这明显可见于约翰福音：<br />光来到世间，世人因自己的行为是恶的，不爱光倒爱黑暗；凡作恶的便恨光，并不来就光，恐怕他的行为受责备；要显明他所行的是靠神而行。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.19.htm">3:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.21.htm">21</a>）<br />由此明显可知，反对仁之善的，也反对主；或也可说，凡作恶的便恨光，并不来就光。“光”就是信主，并且就是主自己，这一点从约翰福音明显看出来（1:9-10；12:35-36，46）。<br />这一点同样从约翰福音的其它地方看出来：<br />世人不能恨你们，却是恨我，因为我指证他们的行为是恶的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约7.7.htm">7:7</a>）<br />这一点在马太福音看得更清楚：<br />祂要向那左边的说，你们这被咒诅的人，离开我，因为我饿了，你们不给我吃；渴了，你们不给我喝；我作客旅，你们不留我住；我赤身露体，你们不给我穿；我病了，我在监里，你们不来看顾我。我实在告诉你们，这些事你们既不做在这些中一个最小的身上，就是不做在我身上了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.41.htm">25:41</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.43.htm">43</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.45.htm">45</a>）<br />这些话表明那些反对仁之善的人如何反对主；也表明每个人受审判是照着仁之善，而非照着脱离良善的信之真。这在马太福音别的地方也有所说明：<br />人子要在祂父的荣耀里，同着众使者降临；那时候，祂要照各人的行为报应各人。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.27.htm">16:27</a>）<br />“行为”表从仁爱发出的良善；仁爱的行为也被称为信的果子。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2349</b></p><p><b>2349.</b>
All the people from the uttermost part. That this signifies all and each of them, is evident from what precedes (that by "boys" and "old men" are signified falsities and evils both recent and confirmed), 
so that here the "people from the uttermost part" signifies all and each of these. Moreover the term "people" in general signifies falsities (see n. 1259, 1260). [2] Here then there is described 
the first state of those within the church who are against the good of charity, and consequently against the Lord, for the one involves the other, because no one can be conjoined with the Lord except 
through love and charity. Love is spiritual conjunction itself, as can be seen from the essence of love; and whoever cannot be conjoined with Him, also cannot acknowledge Him. That they who are not in 
good cannot acknowledge the Lord, that is, have faith in Him, is evident in John: </p>
<p>     The light is come into the world, but men loved the darkness rather than the light, because their works were evil; 
for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his works should be reproved; but he that doeth the truth cometh to the light, that his works may be made manifest, 
because they have been wrought in God (John 3:19-21); </p>
<p>from which it is evident that they who are against the good of charity are against the Lord; or what is the same, that they who are in evil hate 
the light, and do not come to the light. That the "light" is faith in the Lord, and is the Lord Himself, is evident in John (1:9-10; 12:35-36, 46). [3] In like manner in the same elsewhere: </p>
<p>     The 
world cannot hate you, but Me it hateth, because I testify of it that its works are evil (John 7:7). More plainly still in Matthew: </p>
<p>     He shall say unto them on the left hand, Depart from Me, ye 
cursed for I was hungry, and ye gave Me not to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave Me not to drink; I was a stranger, and ye took Me not in; naked, and ye clothed Me not; sick, and in prison, and ye visited 
Me not. Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to Me (Matt. 25:41-43, 45). [4] These words show in what manner those are against the Lord who 
are against the good of charity; and also that everyone is judged according to the good of charity, and not according to the truth of faith when this is separated from good. So also again in Matthew: </p>
<p> 
    The Son of man shall come in the glory of His Father with His angels; and then shall He render to everyone according to his deeds (Matt. 16:27); </p>
<p>"deeds" denote the goods which proceed from charity; 
and the things which are of charity are also called the fruits of faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2349</b></p><p><b>2349.</b>
'All the people from furthest away' means every single one of them. This is clear from what is said immediately above, that there 'boys and old men' means falsities and evils, recent as well as confirmed, 
so that at this point 'people from furthest away' means every single one of them. Also, the word 'people' in general means falsities, see <a href="1259.htm">1259</a>, <a href="1260.htm">1260</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The description at this point then is 
of the initial state of those inside the Church who are opposed to the good of charity and who are as a consequence opposed to the Lord, for one entails the other. Indeed nobody can be joined to the 
Lord except by means of love and charity. Love is spiritual conjunction itself, as may become clear from the essence of love, and anybody who is unable to be joined to Him is unable to acknowledge Him 
either. That those with whom good does not exist cannot acknowledge the Lord, that is, cannot have faith in Him, is clear in John, </p>
<blockquote>
Light has come into the world, but men preferred darkness rather 
than light, because their deeds were evil. He who performs evil deeds hates the light and does not come to the light lest his deeds should be exposed. He however who does the truth comes to the light, 
so that his deeds may be clearly seen, because they have been wrought in God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:-19-21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3:-19-21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From these words it is evident that people who are opposed to the good of charity are opposed to the Lord, 
or what amounts to the same, people immersed in evil hate the light and do not come to the light. That 'the light' is faith in the Lord, and is the Lord Himself, is evident in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:%209,%2010;%2012:%2035,%2036,%2046&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1: 9, 10; 12: 35, 36, 46</a> </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The same point is made in another part of the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me because I testify of it that its works are evil. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%207:-7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 7:-7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And it is said 
more plainly still in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
He will say to those On His left hand, Depart from Me, you cursed; for I was hungry and you gave Me no food; I was thirsty and you gave Me no drink; I was a stranger 
and you did not take Me in, naked and you did not clothe Me, sick and in prison and you did not visit Me. Truly I say to you, Insofar as you did not do it to one of the least of these you did not do it 
to Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2025:%2041-43,%2045&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 25: 41-43, 45</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 This shows in what way they are opposed to the Lord who are opposed to the good of charity. It also shows that everyone is judged according to good that flows from 
charity, not according to the truth of faith when the latter has been separated from good, as is also shown elsewhere in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
The Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father together with 
His angels, and at that time He will repay everyone according to his deeds. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2016:%2027&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 16: 27</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Deeds' stands for the good actions which flow from charity. The deeds of charity are also called the fruits 
of faith. </p>

</p><b>2349.</b>
`Omnis populus ab extremo': quod significet omnia et singula eorum, constat ab illis quae praecedunt, quod per `pueros et senes' significentur falsa et mala tam recentia quam confirmata, inde nunc `populus 
ab extremo' omnia et singula eorum; `populus' in genere etiam significat falsa, videatur n. 1259, 1260.  [2] Hic nunc describitur primus status eorum intra Ecclesiam qui contra bonum charitatis 
sunt et consequenter contra Dominum, nam unum involvit alterum; nemo enim conjungi potest Domino nisi per amorem et charitatem; amor est ipsa conjunctio spiritualis, ut constare potest ab essentia amoris, 
et qui Ipsi non conjungi potest, Ipsum nec potest agnoscere; quod qui non in bono sunt, nec possint Dominum agnoscere, hoc est, fidem in Ipsum habere, constat apud Johannem, 	Lux venit in mundum, 
sed dilexerunt homines tenebras magis quam lucem, erant enim opera eorum mala; qui mala facit, odit lucem, et non venit ad lucem, ne coarguantur opera ejus; qui autem facit veritatem, venit ad lucem, 
ut manifestentur opera ejus, quoniam in Deo facta sunt, iii 19-21; </p>
<p>ex quibus patet quod qui contra bonum charitatis sunt, contra Dominum sint, seu quod idem, qui in malo sunt, quod odio habeant lucem 
nec veniant ad lucem; quod `lux' sit fides in Dominum, et Ipse Dominus, patet apud Johannem i 9, 10; xii 35, 36, 46: [3] similiter alibi apud eundem, 	Non potest mundus odisse vos, Me autem odit, 
quia Ego testor de illo, quod opera ejus mala sint, vii 7: </p>
<p>manifestius adhuc apud Matthaeum, 	Dicet iis qui e sinistris, Discedite a Me, maledicti, nam esurivi et non dedistis Mihi quod ederem; sitivi 
et non 	potastis Me; peregrinus eram et non collegistis Me; nudus, 	et non circuminduistis Me; aegrotus et in custodia, et non visitastis Me;... amen dico vobis, in quantum non fecistis uni ex istis 
minimus, neque mihi fecistis, xxv 41-43, 45. [4] Inde patet quomodo contra Dominum sunt qui contra bonum charitatis; tum quod unusquisque judicetur secundum bonum quod est charitatis, non secundum 
verum quod est fidei dum hoc separatum est a bono; ut quoque alibi apud Matthaeum, 	Venturus Filius hominis in gloria Patris Sui cum angelis Suis, et tunc reddet unicuique juxta facta ejus, xvi 27; </p>
<p>`facta' 
pro bonis quae procedunt a charitate; quae {1} charitatis sunt, etiam fructus fidei vocantur. 	@1 i dum.$ </p>
