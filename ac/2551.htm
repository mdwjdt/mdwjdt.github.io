<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2551节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2551.</strong>“你见了什么才作这事呢”表追查原因。这一点是显而易见的，无需解释，也可从下文清楚看出来，那里讲述了原因。主觉察和思考信之教义，以及是否要请教理性的方式，以特定的秩序呈现在内义中。其原因在于，对于这些事的天使思维就处于这样的序列中。圣经的内义尤其为天使存在，因此适合他们的直觉和思维。对天使来说，当他们思考主，祂的神性与祂的人性，以及人性如何变成神性时，这些就是快乐、喜悦和幸福的体验；因为此时他们被充满主的属天和属灵气场所包围，以致经上论到他们说，他们在主里面。所以，没有什么比根据属于那个气场及其衍生情感而思考更令他们幸福快乐的了。<br />而且与此同时，他们还得到教导和完善，尤其在这方面：即主如何随着自己长大而逐渐并凭自己的力量使祂生来所进入的人身变成神性，因而如何凭祂揭示给自己的知识和认知完善自己的理性，逐渐驱散它的幽暗，并将其引入神性之光中。当圣言被阅读时，这些及无数其它事实，连同生命之光中成千上万的代表物，以属天和属灵的方式一起呈现给众天使。这些事对天使来说极其珍贵，但在世人看来却无足轻重，因为它们远远超出他们的理解，因而处于其理解力的幽暗中。反过来，对世人来说很珍贵的事，如那些含有世俗事务的事，在天使看来则无足轻重，因为它们远在其状态之下，因而处于天使智慧的幽暗中。因此，说来奇妙，进入世人心智的幽暗区域，并且几乎进入他的蔑视中的那些事，会传入天使所享有的光中，并传入他的情感中，属于圣言内义的很多事都是这种情形。</p>

What sawest thou that thou hast done this word? That this signifies a looking into the cause, is evident without explication; as well as from what follows, where the cause is stated. The reason of there 
being thus presented in regular order, in the internal sense, how the Lord perceived and thought concerning the doctrine of faith, and concerning the rational as to whether it should be consulted, 
is that it is angelic to think of these things in such a series. The internal sense of the Word is especially for the angels; and therefore is adapted to their perceptions and thoughts. They are in their 
delightful, nay, in their blessed and happy states, when they are thinking about the Lord, His Divine and His Human, and how the Human was made Divine; for they are encompassed with a celestial and 
spiritual sphere which is full of the Lord; so that it may be said that they are in the Lord. Hence nothing is more blessed and happy to them than to think in accordance with the things that belong 
to that sphere and its derivative affection. [2] At the same time, moreover, they are instructed and perfected, especially in this: how the Lord by degrees and of His own power, as He grew up, made 
Divine the human into which He was born; and thus how, by means of the knowledges that He revealed to Himself He perfected His rational, dispersed by successive steps its shadows, and introduced it into 
Divine light. These and innumerable other things are presented before the angels in a celestial and spiritual manner, with a thousand and a thousand representatives, in the light of life, when the 
Word is being read. But these things, which are so precious to the angels, are to men as of no importance, because above their comprehension, and thus in the shade of their understanding; and on the other 
hand, the things that are precious to men, such as those which contain within them worldly matters, are of no importance to the angels, because below their state and thus in the shade of their wisdom. 
Thus, wonderful to say, the things that come to shade with man, and almost into contempt, with the angels pass into light, and into their affection, as is the case with many things of the internal 
sense of the Word. </p>

'What did you see, that you have done this thing?' means a looking into the cause. This is evident without explanation, as well as from what follows where the cause is stated. The reason ideas of how 
the Lord perceived and thought regarding the doctrine of faith, and regarding the rational, whether it should be consulted, are presented in that particular order in the internal sense is that it is 
angel-like to think about them in such a sequence. The internal sense of the Word exists in particular for angels, and has accordingly been rendered suitable to their perceptions and thoughts. For them 
these are experiences of delight, indeed of bliss and of happiness, when they are thinking about the Lord, about His Divinity and His Humanity, and about how the latter was made Divine. For when thinking 
about these they are encompassed by a celestial and spiritual sphere which is filled with the Lord, so that it may be said of them that they are in the Lord. Consequently nothing is more blissful 
and happy for them than to think in accordance with those things which belong to that sphere and to the affection resulting from this. What is more, they are at the same time instructed and perfected, 
in particular in the matter of how as He grew up the Lord by degrees and from His own power made Divine the human into which He had been born, and thus how, by means of knowledge and cognitions which 
He revealed to Himself, He perfected His rational, gradually dispelled its shadows, and brought it into Divine light. When the Word is being read, these and countless other realities are presented 
to angels in a celestial and spiritual fashion, together with thousands and thousands of representatives in the light of life. But these matters which to angels are so precious are to men of little importance 
since they are above and beyond them and so are lost in the darkened parts of their understanding. Conversely those which are precious to men, such as hold worldly matters within them, are to 
angels of little importance since they are beneath their state of existence and so are lost in the darkened parts of their wisdom. Thus, wondrous to tell, the very things which enter the darkened parts 
of man's mind, and almost into his contempt, pass into the light angels enjoy and into their affection, as do many things which belong to the internal sense of the Word. </p>

`Quid vidisti quod feceris verbum hoc?': quod significet intuitionem in causam, patet absque explicatione, tum ab iis qua sequuntur ubi causa dicitur.  Quod ita ordine in sensu interno sistatur quomodo 
Dominus perceperit et cogitaverit de doctrina fidei, et de rationali num consuleretur, causa est quia angelicum est de illis in tali serie cogitare.  Verbi sensus internus (t)est imprimis pro angelis, 
ita eorum perceptionibus et cogitationibus adaptatus; in suis delectabilibus, immo beatis et felicibus sunt, cum de Domino, Ipsius Divino e Humano, et de hoc quomodo Divinum factum, cogitant, nam 
circumfunduntur sphaera caelesti et spirituali quae plena est Domino, ita ut dici queat quod sint in Domino, inde nihil beatius et felicius es illis quam secundum illa quae sphaerae sunt et affectionis 
inde, cogitare simul etiam tunc instruuntur et perficiuntur, in eo imprimis quomodo Dominus per gradus sicut adolevit, humanum in quod natus, Divinum ex propria potentia fecerit, ita quomodo per scientias 
et cognitione' quas Sibi Ipsi revelavit, rationale Suum perfecit, umbras ejus successive discussit, et illud in Divinam lucem immisit: haec et innumerabili alia sistuntur coram angelis caelesti 
et spirituali modo cum mille e mille repraesentativis in luce vitae, cum Verbum legitur.  Sed haec quae angelis tam pretiosa, sunt hominibus sicut levia, quia supra captum, ita in umbra eorum intellectus 
{1}; et vicissim, quae (o)sunt hominibus pretiosa, ut sunt illa in quibus mundana, sunt angelis levia, quia infra statum, ita in umbra eorum sapientiae; (m)ita {2}, quod mirus' quae veniunt in umbram 
hominis, et paene in ejus contemptum, illa transeunt in lucem angelorum et in affectionem, ut sunt plura quae sensus interni Verbi sunt.' 	@1 i sunt.$ 	@2 nam.$ </p>
