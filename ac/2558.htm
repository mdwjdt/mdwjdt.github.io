<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2558节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2558.</strong>“后来作了我的妻子”表属灵真理以理性为媒介与属天之物联结起来。这从作为亚伯拉罕妻子的撒拉和作为他妹子的撒拉的代表清楚可知：作为亚伯拉罕妻子的撒拉是指与属天良善结合的属灵真理（参看<a href="2507.htm">2507</a>节）；作为他妹子的撒拉是指理性真理（<a href="2508.htm">2508</a>节）。因此，撒拉从妹子变成妻子，表示属灵真理以理性为媒介与属天之物结合。从上一节明显可知所有这一切蕴涵着什么。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2558</b></p><p><b>2558.</b>
And she became my wife. That this signifies that spiritual truth was conjoined with the celestial by the mediumship of rationality, is evident from the representation of Sarah as Abraham's wife, as being 
spiritual truth conjoined with celestial good (see n. 2507); and from the representation of the same as his sister, as being rational truth (n. 2508). Hence that she became his wife, from being his 
sister, signifies that by rationality as a medium spiritual truth was conjoined with the celestial. (How these things are circumstanced is evident from what has been said just above, n. 2557.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2558</b></p><p><b>2558.</b>
'She became my wife' means that spiritual truth was joined to the celestial, with rationality serving as the means. This is clear from the representation of 'Sarah' when Abraham's 'wife' as spiritual 
truth joined to celestial good, dealt with in <a href="2507.htm">2507</a>, and from the representation of the same character when 'a sister' as rational truth, dealt with in <a href="2508.htm">2508</a>. Consequently the statement that from being 
'a sister' she became 'a wife' means that spiritual truth was joined to the celestial, with rationality serving as the means. What is implied in all this becomes clear from what has been stated immediately 
above in <a href="2557.htm">2557</a>. </p>

</p><b>2558.</b>
Quod `facta mihi in uxorem' significet quod verum spirituale conjunctum sit caelesti media rationalitate, constat a repraesentatione `Sarae' ut uxoris Abrahami quod sit verum spirituale conjunctum bono 
caelesti, de qua n. 2507; et ex repraesentatione ejusdem ut sororis quod sit verum rationale, de qua n. 2508; inde significatur per quod ex `sorore' facta sit `uxor,' quod media rationalitate cerum 
spirituale conjunctum sit caelesti: quomodo haec se habent, constare potest ex illis quae mox supra n. 2557 dicta sunt. </p>
