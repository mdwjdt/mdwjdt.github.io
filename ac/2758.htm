<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2758节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2758.</strong>真正的婚姻之爱就是天堂，这一事实在自然界中得到体现。因为一般来说，整个自然界没有一物不以某种方式代表主的国度，自然界的全部源头都来自灵界。没有一个先于自身的源头之物什么也不是。与原因，因而与目的无关的事物是不存在的。没有这种关联的事物会瞬间崩塌，不再是任何事物。在自然界中的主国度的代表物由此而来。婚姻之爱就是天堂，这一事实从毛虫蜕变成蛹或茧，然后变成飞行生物明显看出来。因为当它们的婚礼到来时，也就是当它们摆脱早期形体，或毛虫状态，并装上翅膀、变成飞行生物时，它们就飞升空中，也就是它们的天堂；然后在空中一起玩耍、结婚、产卵，并吸食花汁滋养自己。就在这时，它们也处于自己的美丽当中，因为其翅膀点缀了金、银，以及其它鲜艳的色彩。诸如此类的事就是婚姻中成双成对的倾向在这类微不足道的小生物中所产生的。</p>

That genuine conjugial love is heaven, is represented in the kingdoms of nature; for there is nothing in all nature that does not in some way represent the Lord's kingdom in general, since the natural 
kingdom derives all its origin from the spiritual. What is without an origin prior to itself is nothing. Nothing exists that is unconnected with a cause, and thus with an end. What is unconnected falls 
away in a moment, and becomes nothing; from this then are the representatives of the Lord's kingdom in the kingdoms of nature. That conjugial love is heaven, is manifest from the transformation of 
little worms into nymphs and chrysalides, and thus into winged insects; for when their time of nuptials comes-which is when they put off their earthly form, or their worm-like form, and are embellished 
with wings and become flying creatures-they are then elevated into the air, which is their heaven; and there they sport with each other, perform their marriage rites, lay eggs, and nourish themselves 
on the juices of flowers. They are then also in their beauty; for they have wings decorated with golden, silver, and other elegantly marked colors. Such things does the marriage principle produce among 
such vile little worms. </p>

The truth that genuine conjugial love is heaven is represented in the kingdoms of nature, for nothing exists in the whole natural order which is not in some way representative of the Lord's kingdom in 
general, since the natural kingdom has its entire origin in the spiritual kingdom. That which is without an origin prior to itself is nothing, for nothing exists without connection from a cause and 
so from an end. That which is without such connection collapses in an instant and ceases to be anything. This then explains where the representatives of the Lord's kingdom within the kingdoms of nature 
have their origin. The truth that conjugial love is heaven is evident from the metamorphosis of caterpillars into pupae or chrysalises and then into creatures that fly. For when the time arrives for 
them to be wedded - which is when they shed their earthly form, or their caterpillar state - they are adorned with wings and become creatures that fly, at which point they are raised up into the air, 
which is their heaven. In the air they play together, make marriages, lay eggs, and are nourished by the juices from flowers. At that time also they exist in their beauty, for their wings are tinged 
with gold, silver, and other lovely shades. Such things as these are what the inclination to pair off in marriage produces among such insignificant and tiny creatures. </p>

{1}  Quod genuinus amor conjugialis sit caelum, repraesentatur regnis naturae, nam nihil in universa natura datur quod non aliquo modo repraesentat regnum Domini in communi, naturale enim omnem suam 
originem e regno spirituali ducit {2}; quod absque origine se priore est, est nihil, non datur aliquod inconnexum a causa, ita a fine, quod inconnexum dilabitur momento, et fit nihil; inde nunc repraesentativa 
regni Domini in regnis naturae: amor conjugialis quod caelum, ex transformatione vermiculorum in nymphas seu {3} chrysallides, et sic in volatilia, patet, cum enim tempus eorum nuptiarum venit, 
quod est cum exuunt formam terrestrem, quae est eorum vermicularis, insigniuntur alis, ac fiunt volatilia, tuae elevantur in atmosphaeram, suum caelum; ibi inter se ludunt, conjugia agunt, ponunt 
ova, et succis e floribus nutriuntur; in pulchritudine etiam sua tunc sunt, alas enim habent coloribus aureis, argenteis, aliisque venuste discretis, decoratas: talia producit conjugia apud tam vilia 
animalcula. 	@1 n. 2758 and 2759 were written and numbered in reverse order, but directions are inserted for their transposition.$ 	@2 habet.$ 	@3 et.$ </p>
