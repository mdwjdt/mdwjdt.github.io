<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>189.</strong>此后，有缓缓上升的道路出现，表示他随着认识真理与良善，承认自我的本质，将逐步被引入天堂。因为人若不了解自我，不认识真理与良善，就不能被引入天堂。在本章的结尾处，我将继续阐述这一话题。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]189.</strong> Then some gently rising paths become visible, symbolizing the fact that we will be led gradually toward heaven by a knowledge of truth and goodness and an acknowledgment of our own nature. Unless we acknowledge who we are and learn what is true and good, we can never be led there.<br />See the continuation at the end of this chapter [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_189/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_314" target=_top>314-319</a>]. </p>

Afterwards pathways were seen sloping gently upward, which signify that by the knowledges of what is true and good, and by self-acknowledgment, he should be led by degrees toward heaven; for no one can 
be conducted thither without such self-acknowledgment, and the knowledges of what is true and good. A continuation of this subject may be seen at the end of this chapter. </p>
<p>     GENESIS 3      1. 
And the serpent was more subtle than any wild animal of the field which Jehovah God had made; and he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?      2. And 
the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the tree of the garden;     3. But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither 
shall ye touch it, lest ye die.      4. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die.      5. For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, 
and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.      6. And the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to give intelligence, and she 
took of the fruit thereof and did eat, and she gave also to her man [vir] with her, and he did eat.      7. And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves 
together, and made themselves girdles.      8. And they heard the voice of Jehovah God going to itself in the garden in the air of the day; and the man and his wife hid themselves from the 
face of Jehovah God in the midst of the tree of the garden.      9. And Jehovah God cried unto the man [homo], and said unto him, Where art thou?      10. And he said, I heard Thy voice in the garden, 
and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.      11. And He said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?  
    12. And the man [homo] said, The woman whom Thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.      13. And Jehovah God said unto the woman, Why hast thou done this? And the woman 
said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. </p>

After this he sees paths gently sloping upwards. These mean that he is to be led to heaven little by little, by means of cognitions of truth and good and by self-acknowledgement. For without self-acknowledgement 
and without cognitions of truth and good, nobody can be brought to that place. For a continuation of the subject, see the end of this chapter.  </p>

Postea visae semitae obliquae sursum lente, significantes quod per cognitiones veri et boni perque agnitionem sui sensim duceretur versus caelum; nam absque agnitione sui et cognitionibus veri et boni 
nemo illuc duci potest. Continuatio videatur in fine hujus capitis. </p>
<p>CAPUT III 1.  Et serpens fuit astutus prae omni fera agri, quam fecit JEHOVAH DEUS; et dixit ad mulierem, Etiamne dixit DEUS, 
Non comedetis de omni arbore horti? 2.  Et dixit mulier ad serpentem, De fructu arboris horti comedemus. 3.  Et de fructu arboris, quae in medio horti, dixit DEUS, Non comedetis de illo, nec tangetis 
illum, ne inde moriamini. 4.  Et dixit serpens ad mulierem, Non moriendo morimini. 5.  Quia novit DEUS, quod in die quo editis de eo, et aperiantur oculi vestri, et sitis sicut DEUS, scientes bonum 
et malam. 6.  Et vidit mulier, quod bona arbor ad esum, et quod appetibilis ea oculis, et desiderabilis arbor ad dandum intelligentiam, et sumpsit ex fructu ejus, et edit; et dedit etiam viro suo 
secum, et comedit. 7.  Et aperti sunt oculi amborum, et cognoverunt quod nudi ii, et consuerunt folium ficus, et fecerunt sibi cingula. 8.  Et audiverunt vocem JEHOVAE DEUS,sibi euntem in horto, ad 
auram diei; et occultavit se homo, et uxor ejus, a facie JEHOVAE DEI, in medio arboris horti. 9.  Et clamavit JEHOVAH DEUS ad hominem, et dixit ei, Ubi tu?     10.  Et dixit, Vocem Tuam audivi in horto, 
et timui, quia nudus ego, et occultavi me. 11.  Et dixit, Quis indicavit tibi, quod nudus tu? annon de arbore, de qua praecepi tibi ut non edas de ea, edisti? 12.  Et dixit homo, Mulier, quam dedisti 
mecum, ea dedit mihi de arbore, et comedi. 13.  Et dixit JEHOVAH DEUS mulieri, Quare hoc fecisti?  Et dixit mulier, Serpens decepit me, et edi. </p>
