<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1688节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1688.</strong>“西订谷有许多沥青坑”表虚假与恶欲的不洁。这从“西订”、“坑”和“沥青”的含义清楚可知：“西订”是指不洁（如前所述，3节），“坑”是指虚假，“沥青”是指恶欲。虚假被称为“坑”，因为坑里面有污水，恶欲被称为“沥青”，因为这水散发出恶臭的硫磺味。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1688.</strong> The valley of Siddim was pit after pit (or full of pits) of tar symbolizes dirty lies and dirty cravings. This can be seen from the symbolism of Siddim as filth (discussed above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1688/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_3" target=_top>3</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1688/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1666" target=_top>1666</a>]). It can also be seen from the symbolism of pits as lies and of tar as cravings. Lies are called pits here because of the dirty water these pits held, and cravings are called tar because of the foul, sulfurous smell in that water. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1688</b></p><p><b>1688.</b>
The valley of Siddim was pits, pits [or, full of pits] of bitumen. That this signifies the uncleanness of the falsities and cupidities, is evident from the signification of "Siddim," which is uncleanness 
(as stated above at verse 3); also from the signification of "pits," as being falsities and of "bitumen," as being cupidities. Falsities are called "pits," from the unclean water in them; and cupidities 
are called "bitumen," from the foul sulphurous smell in such water. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1688</b></p><p><b>1688.</b>
That 'the valley of Siddim was pits after pits - or was full of pits - of bitumen' means the uncleanness of falsities and evil desires is clear from the meaning of 'Siddim' as uncleanness, dealt with 
above at verse 3, and also from the meaning of 'pits' as falsities, and of 'bitumen' as evil desires. Falsities are called 'pits' on account of the filthy water these contain, and evil desires are called 
'bitumen' on account of the foul sulphurous stench of such water. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1688</b>
</p><b>1688.</b>
'Vallis Siddim putei putei, seu plena puteis, bituminis quod significet immundum falsitatum et cupiditatum, constat significatione 'Siddim' quod sit immundum, de qua supra ad vers. 3 tum a significatione 
'puteorum' quod sint falsitates, et 'bituminis' quod sint cupiditates; 'putei' vocantur falsitates ex immunda aqua et 'bitumen' cupiditates ex foedo sulphureo nidore in tali aqua. </p>
