<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8273节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8273.</strong>“耶和华是战士”表主提供保护，免受来自地狱的一切邪恶和虚假的伤害。这从“战士”的含义清楚可知，“战士”是指与虚假和邪恶，也就是地狱争战并战胜它们的人，在此是指保护人免受它们伤害的人。因为如前所示，当地狱攻击人时，主独自为他争战，并保护他；主不断如此行，尤其在试探期间，试探就是属灵的争战。主被称为“战士”，主是是由于这一事实：当主在世时，祂独自，也就是说，祂全凭自己与地狱争战；那时，地狱大部分是敞开的，并且攻击进入来世的所有人，无一例外，企图掌控他们。那时，魔鬼团伙，也就是地狱之所以如此猖獗，是因为经过天堂的神性，也就是在主降临之前的神性人身，还没有强大到足以反对剧增的邪恶和虚假的地步。因此，神性乐意为给自己取一个人形，使之成为神性。同时，通过祂允许自己所遭受的争战，祂将魔鬼团伙投入地狱，关在那里，使他们服从天堂；同时还恢复天堂本身的秩序。这些争战是主被称为“战士”的首要原因。争战过后，当祂由此战胜地狱，使自己成为公义时，仍被称为“战士”，这是因为祂凭神性能力保护人们，并且不断如此行，尤其在试探的争战期间。<br />主全凭自己独自与地狱争战并战胜他们，这一真理可见于以赛亚书：<br />公平转而退后，公义站在远处；真理在街上仆倒，正直也不得进入。真理被夺；离恶的人反为疯狂。耶和华看见了，没有公平，这在祂眼里为恶。祂见无人，竟无人代求，甚为诧异，就用自己的膀臂为祂施行拯救，祂的公义将祂扶起。祂穿上公义为铠甲， 戴上救恩为头盔。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.14.htm">59:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.17.htm">17</a>）<br />这描述了那时两个世界的情况，并声明主全凭自己独自重建陷入崩溃状态的事物。这一点在以赛亚书的别处也有阐述：<br />这从以东的波斯拉来，穿溅了血的衣服，服装华丽、能力广大、大步行走的是谁呢？就是我，是凭公义说话，以大能施行拯救。我独自踹酒榨，众民中无一人与我同在，他们的血溅在我衣服上；因为报仇之日在我心中，我赎回之年已经来到。我四周张望，但没有人帮助；我诧异，没有人扶持。所以我的膀臂为我施行拯救。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.1.htm">63:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.3.htm">3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.5.htm">5</a>）<br />从这些话可以看出，主在世时独自与地狱争战并战胜它们。<br />至于与地狱争战并战胜它们，情况是这样：凡一次战胜它们的人就永远战胜它们；事实上，通过得胜，他为自己获得战胜它们的能力，因为他在同等程度上在自己里面强化了爱之良善和信之真理，并将其变成自己的，地狱后来不敢对这些良善和真理做什么。当主在世时，祂允许自己承受来自所有地狱的试探的争战，并通过这些争战在自己里面将人身变成神性，同时永远使地狱处于服从的状态（参看<a href="1663.htm">1663</a>，<a href="1668.htm">1668</a>，<a href="1690.htm">1690</a>，<a href="1692.htm">1692</a>，<a href="1737.htm">1737</a>，<a href="1813.htm">1813</a>，<a href="1820.htm">1820</a>，<a href="2776.htm">2776</a>，<a href="2786.htm">2786</a>，<a href="2795.htm">2795</a>，<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>，<a href="2814.htm">2814</a>，<a href="2816.htm">2816</a>，<a href="4287.htm">4287</a>节）。正因如此，主独自永远拥有掌控地狱的权柄；并凭神性能力为人争战。这解释了为何主在此被称为“战士”，以及在这些经文中被称为“勇士”：<br />耶和华必像勇士出去，必像战士激起热情，要用战胜仇敌。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.13.htm">42:13</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />这荣耀的王是谁呢？就是有强有力的耶和华，一个勇士，耶和华是战场上的勇士。这荣耀的王是谁呢？万军之耶和华。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗24.8.htm">24:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗24.10.htm">10</a>）<br />在圣言中，凡提及“战争或战场”的地方，在内义上都表示反对虚假和邪恶的属灵战争；或也可说，反对魔鬼，也就是地狱（<a href="1664.htm">1664</a>，<a href="2686.htm">2686</a>节）的属灵战争。主反对地狱的战争或争战就是圣言的历史和预言部分在内义上所论述的主题；同样的主题是主为了人的战争或争战。在有主的教会存在于其中的古人当中也有一部圣言，这部圣言既有历史，也有预言，只是如今不存在了。该圣言的历史部分被称为“耶和华战记”，预言部分被称为“诗歌”（Enunciations或Utterances）。摩西五经（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.14.htm">21:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.27.htm">27</a>）提到过这部圣言。民数记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.27.htm">21:27</a>）所提到的这个词（诗歌）表示预言，这一点从民数记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.7.htm">23:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.18.htm">18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.3.htm">24:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.15.htm">15</a>）所给出的这个词的含义明显看出来。在那部圣言中，“耶和华的战争”表示主在世时与地狱的争战和胜利，以及随后祂为了人、教会和其国度的永恒争战和胜利。地狱总想要自高自大，因为他们只渴望统治；但唯独主管治他们。他们展示自己的尝试就像沸腾的气泡，或弯腰拱背的人。不过，每当他们尝试这种事时，他们当中大量的人就被扔得更深。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8273</b></p><p><b>8273.</b>
Jehovah is a man of war. That this signifies that the Lord protects against all evils and falsities that are from the hells, is evident from the signification of "a man of war," as being one who fights 
against falsities and evils, that is, against the hells, and conquers them, here who protects man against them; for, as before shown, the Lord alone fights for man and protects him when he is assaulted 
by the hells, and this continually, especially in temptations, which are spiritual combats. The Lord is called "a man of war" primarily from the fact that when He was in the world, He alone, that 
is, from Himself, fought against the hells, which were then for the most part open, and attacked and endeavored to subjugate all who came into the other life. The reason why the diabolical crew-that 
is, the hells-were at that time so rampant, was that the Divine passing through heaven, which before the coming of the Lord was the Divine Human, did not avail against evils and falsities, then so immensely 
increased. Therefore it pleased the Divine Itself to assume the Human and to make this Divine, and then at the same time through combats admitted into Himself to cast that diabolical crew into 
the hells, and shut them in there, and to make them subject to the heavens; and at the same time also to reduce the heavens themselves into order. From these combats the Lord is first called "a man of 
war," and also afterward, because when He had thus conquered the hells and had become righteousness, He protects men by His Divine power, and this continually, and especially in the combats of temptations. [2] 
That the Lord alone and from Himself fought against the hells and overcame them, see in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Judgment hath been cast backward, and righteousness stood afar off; for truth hath stumbled 
in the street, and uprightness cannot approach; while truth hath been taken away; and he that departeth from evil is insane: Jehovah saw, and it was evil in His eyes that there was no judgment; 
and He saw that there was no man, and He was amazed that there was no one interceding; therefore His arm wrought salvation for Him; and His righteousness stirred Him up; hence He put on righteousness 
as a breast-plate, and a helmet of salvation upon His head (59:14-17); </p>
<p>there is here described the state of that time in both worlds, and that the Lord from Himself alone restored the fallen estate. 
In like manner elsewhere in the same: </p>
<p>     Who is this that cometh from Edom, with sprinkled garments from Bozrah? this that is honorable in his apparel, marching in the multitude of his strength? I 
that speak in righteousness, great for salvation; I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the peoples not a man with Me, whence their victory hath been sprinkled upon My garments; for the day of vengeance 
is in My heart, and the year of My redeemed had come; I looked around, but there was no one helping; and I was amazed, but there was no one supporting; therefore Mine arm wrought salvation for 
Me (Isa. 63:1, 3-5); </p>
<p>from these words it can be seen that in the world the Lord fought alone against the hells, and overcame them. [3] As regards combats and victories over the hells, the case is this. 
He who once overcomes them overcomes them perpetually; because through victory he procures for himself power over them, for in the same proportion he confirms in himself, and appropriates to himself, 
the good which is of love and the truth which is of faith, against which the hells afterward dare nothing. When the Lord was in the world He admitted combats of temptations into Himself from all 
the hells, and through these He made the Human in Himself Divine, and at the same time He forever reduced the hells to obedience (see n. 1663, 1668, 1690, 1692, 1737, 1813, 1820, 2776, 2786, 2795, 2803, 
2814, 2816, 4287). From this it is that the Lord alone has power over the hells eternally; and from Divine power fights for man. From this then it is that the Lord is called "a man of war," and also 
a "Hero," as also in these passages: </p>
<p>     Jehovah shall go forth like a Hero, He shall stir up zeal like a man of wars, He shall prevail over His enemies (Isa. 42:13).       Who is this King of glory? 
Jehovah strong and a Hero, Jehovah a Hero of war. Who is this King of glory? Jehovah Zebaoth [of armies] (Ps. 24:8, 10). [4] In the Word, where mention is made of "war," in the internal sense there 
is meant spiritual war, which is against falsities and evils; or what is the same, which is against the devil, that is, the hells (n. 1664, 2686). The wars or combats of the Lord against the hells 
are treated of in the internal sense in both the historicals and the propheticals of the Word; in like manner the wars and combats of the Lord for man. Among the ancients with whom was the Lord's church, 
there was also a Word both historic and prophetic, which at this day is not extant. The historic Word was called "The Book of the Wars of Jehovah," and the prophetic Word, "The Enunciations." This 
Word is mentioned in Moses (Num. 21:14, 27). That by this word ["Enunciations"], used in the 27th verse, are signified prophetical things, is evident from the meaning of this word [here "parable"] in 
Num. 23:7, 18; 24:3, 15. By "the wars of Jehovah" were there meant the Lord's combats and victories against the hells when He was in the world, and also His subsequent perpetual combats and victories 
for man, for the church, and for His kingdom. For the hells continually wish to raise themselves up, because they breathe nothing but domination; but they are repressed by the Lord alone. Their attempts 
to force their way out appear like bubblings up, and like the dorsal ejections from man; but as often as they attempt this, so often many of them are cast down more deeply there. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8273</b></p><p><b>8273.</b>
'Jehovah is a man of war' means that the Lord provides protection against all evils and falsities, which come from the hells. This is clear from the meaning of 'a man of war' as one who fights against 
falsities and evils, that is, against the hells, and overcomes them, at this point one who provides a person protection against them. For as shown already, the Lord alone fights on behalf of a person 
and protects him when he is under attack from the hells; He does so constantly, especially in temptations, which are spiritual conflicts. The Lord is called 'a man of war', primarily because when He 
was in the world He fought alone, that is, all by Himself, against the hells, which at that time were for the most part open. They were attacking and attempting to bring under their control all without 
exception who were entering the next life. The reason why the devil's crew, that is, the hells, were prowling around in that way then was that the Divine passing through heaven, which was the Divine 
Human before the Lord's Coming, was not powerful enough to oppose the evils and falsities which had increased so enormously. Therefore the Divine was pleased to take upon Himself a Human Form and make 
it Divine. At the same time - through the conflicts to which He allowed Himself to be subjected - He cast the devil's crew into the hells, shut them in there, and made them subject to the heavens; 
also at the same time He restored the heavens themselves to order. These conflicts are the primary reason for calling the Lord 'a man of war'. And after them, when He had thereby conquered the hells and 
made Himself righteousness, He has been called such because with Divine power He provides people protection, doing so constantly, and especially in the conflicts brought by temptations. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The 
truth that the Lord alone, all by Himself, fought against the hells and overcame them is presented in the following way in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Judgement is cast away backwards, and justice stands afar off, for 
truth has stumbled in the street, and uprightness cannot come in; while truth has been removed, and he who retreats from evil is insane. Jehovah saw, and it was evil in His eyes that there was no judgement. 
And He saw that there was no man (vir), and wondered that there was no intercessor therefore His own arm brought salvation to Him, and His righteousness lifted Him up. Consequently He put on righteousness 
as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation upon His head. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2059:14-17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 59:14-17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This describes conditions at that time in both worlds and declares that the Lord all by Himself, alone, re-established 
things that were in a state of collapse. The like is stated elsewhere in the same prophet, </p>
<p>Who is this who comes from Edom, with spattered clothes from Bozra, He that is glorious in His apparel, 
marching in the vast numbers of His strength? I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save. I have trodden the winepress alone, and from the peoples not a man (vir) was with Me. Consequently their 
victory<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> has been sprinkled on My clothes. For the day of vengeance was in My heart, and the year of My redeemed had come. I had looked around, but there was no helper, and <a href="7.htm">7</a> wondered, but there was 
no one to uphold; therefore My own arm brought salvation to Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2063:1-5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 63:1-5</a>. </p>
<p>These quotations make it clear that when in the world, the Lord fought alone against the hells and overcame them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
So far as conflicts with and victories over the hells are concerned, the truth is that anyone who overcomes them once does so for evermore; for through victory he gains power over them, since in the 
same measure he consolidates within himself, and makes his own, the good of love and the truth of faith against which the hells afterwards do not dare to attempt anything. When He was in the world 
the Lord allowed Himself to endure conflicts brought by temptations from all the hells, and through those conflicts He made Divine the Human within Him and at the same time reduced the hells to a state 
of obedience for evermore, see <a href="1663.htm">1663</a>, <a href="1668.htm">1668</a>, <a href="1690.htm">1690</a>, <a href="1692.htm">1692</a>, <a href="1737.htm">1737</a>, <a href="1813.htm">1813</a>, <a href="1820.htm">1820</a>, <a href="2776.htm">2776</a>, <a href="2786.htm">2786</a>, <a href="2795.htm">2795</a>, <a href="2803.htm">2803</a>, <a href="2814.htm">2814</a>, <a href="2816.htm">2816</a>, <a href="4287.htm">4287</a>. So it is that the Lord alone has power over the hells for ever, and with Divine power 
fights on behalf of a person. This now explains why the Lord is called 'a man of war' and also 'a mighty man', as again in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah will go forth as a mighty man, as a man of wars He will 
arouse zeal; He will prevail over His enemies. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2042:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 42:13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in David, </p>
<blockquote>
Who is this King of glory? Jehovah strong and a mighty man, Jehovah a mighty man of war. Who is this King of glory? Jehovah 
Zebaoth (Jehovah of Hosts or Armies). <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2024:8,10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 24:8,10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Wherever 'war' is mentioned in the Word, spiritual war against falsities and evils - or what amounts to the same thing, against the devil, 
that is, the hells - is meant in the internal sense, <a href="1664.htm">1664</a>, <a href="2686.htm">2686</a>. The wars or battles which the Lord fought against the hells are the subject in the internal sense both in the historical sections of the 
Word and in its prophetical parts; and no less the subject are the Lord's wars or battles fought on behalf of man. With the Ancients, with whom the Lord's Church existed, there also existed a Word, 
having both a historical section and a prophetical part, which is not extant at the present day. Its historical section was called The Book of the Wars of Jehovah and its prophetical part The Utterances. 
That Word is referred to in Moses, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2021:14,%2027&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 21:14, 27</a>. The fact that the expression used in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2021:27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 21:27</a> means prophetical utterances is evident from the meaning the expression is given at <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2023:7,%2018;%2024:3,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 23:7, 18; 24:3, 15</a>. The Wars of Jehovah in that Word meant the Lord's battles against and His victories over the hells when He was in the world. They also meant the battles fought after that, and the everlasting 
victories won by Him, on behalf of man, the Church, and His kingdom. The hells desire constantly to puff themselves up, for they yearn only to dominate; but they are kept in check by the Lord alone. 
Their attempts to exert themselves are seen as bubbles boiling up or as a person arching his back. But every time they attempt such a thing a large number of them are cast further down.

`Jehovah vir belli': quod significet quod Dominus contra omnia mala et falsa, quae ab infernis, tutetur, constat ex significatione `viri belli' quod sit qui contra falsa et mala, hoc est, contra inferna, 
pugnat et vincit, hic qui hominem contra illa tutatur, nam, ut prius ostensum est, Dominus solus pugnat pro homine et tutatur illum cum {1}impugnatur ab infernis, et hoc continue, imprimis in tentationibus, 
quae sunt pugnae spirituales; Dominus `vir belli' appellatur ex eo primum quod, cum in mundo fuit, solus, hoc est, ex Se, pugnaverit contra inferna, quae tunc quoad plurem partem aperta fuerunt, 
et omnes quotcumque in alteram vitam veniebant, aggrediebantur et subjugare conabantur.  Causa quod diabolica turba, hoc est, {2}inferna, tunc ita grassarentur, erat quia Divinum transiens per 
caelum, quod ante Adventum Domini Divinum Humanum fuit, non valuit contra mala et falsa quae tam immensum aucta fuerunt; idcirco (d)Ipsi Divino placuit Humanum assumere, et Hoc Divinum facere, et tunc 
simul per pugnas in Se admissas turbam illam diabolicam in inferna conjicere, et ibi includere, (c)ac subjicere caelis, et simul {3}etiam ipsos caelos in ordinem redigere; ex his pugnis Dominus primum 
vocatur `vir belli'; et postea quod, cum ita vicerat inferna et justitia factus, ex Divina potentia tutetur homines et hoc continue, et imprimis in pugnis tentationum. 	2 Quod Dominus solus et ex 
Se pugnaverit contra inferna et vicerit illa, ita apud Esaiam, Rejectum est retro judicium, et justitia e longinquo stetit, nam impegit in platea veritas, et rectitudo non potest advenire; dum veritas 
sublata est, et recedens a malo insanus; vidit Jehovah, et malum fuit in oculis Ipsius quod non judicium; et vidit quod non vir, et obstupuit quod non intercedens; ideo salutem praestitit Ipsi brachium 
Suum, et justitia Ipsius suscitavit Ipsum; unde induit justitiam sicut loricam, et galeam salutis super caput Suum, lix 14-17; </p>
<p>describitur hic status illius temporis (d)in utroque mundo, et quod 
Dominus {4}ex Se solus rem lapsam restituerit: pariter alibi apud eundem, Quis hic qui venit ex Edom, conspersus vestes ex Bozra? Hic honorabilis in vestitu Suo, incedens in multitudine roboris Sui? 
 Ego Qui loquor in justitia, magnus ad {5}salutem; torcular calcavi solus, et de populis non vir Mecum, unde sparsa est victoria illorum super vestes Meas; (m)nam dies vindictae in corde Meo, et annus 
redemptorum Meorum venerat:(n) circumspexeram sed non auxilians, et obstupui sed non suffulciens, ideo salutem (t)Mihi praestitit brachium Meum, lxiii 1-5; </p>
<p>ex his constare potest quod Dominus in mundo 
pugnaverit solus contra inferna ac illa vicerit; cum pugnis et victoriis super inferna ita 3 se habet: qui semel illa vincit perpetuo illa vincit, nam per victoriam comparat sibi potentiam super illa, 
{6}tantum enim in se confirmat et tantum sibi appropriat bonum quod amoris et verum quod fidei, contra quae postea inferna nihil audent; Dominus cum in mundo fuit, tentationum pugnas in Se ab omnibus

2803, 2814, 2816, 4287;(n) inde est quod solus Dominus super inferna potentiam habeat in aeternum, et ex Divina {7} potentia pro homine {8} pugnet.  Inde nunc est quod Dominus dicatur `vir belli,' et
