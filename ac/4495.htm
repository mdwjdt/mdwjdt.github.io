<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4495节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4495.</strong>“到第三天”表甚至持续到结束。这从“第三天”的含义清楚可知，“第三天”是指从开始到结束的完整事物（参看<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>节），因而也表连续事物。那些视圣言的历史为纯粹的世俗历史，之所以神圣仅仅是因为它们出现在圣卷中的人，几乎难以相信“第三天”具有这样的的含义。但是，前面的解释已说明，不仅圣言的历史本身包含并未显现在文字中的属灵和属天事物在里面，而且一切话，甚至一切数字也是如此。蒙主的神性怜悯，这一真相在预言部分看得更加清楚，因为字义中的预言部分不像历史部分那样把心思与一系列事件联系得那么紧密。但是，凡认真研究圣言内在内容的人必能逐渐看出，数字“三”，以及数字“七”、“十二”含有更深层的秘密在里面。如果这些数字含有如此充分的含义，那么可知，出现在圣言中的其它一切数字也含有某种更深层次的东西，因为圣言处处是神圣的。<br />有时，当与天使交谈时，看似所写的数字就出现在我眼前，仿佛在大白天的一张纸上；我意识到他们正在谈论的属灵实体逐渐变成这样的数字。我从这个经历还得知，圣言中所提到的一切数字都含有某种奥秘在里面。这一点从以下经文很明显地看出来：<br />他又量了圣耶路撒冷的城墙，按着人的尺寸，就是天使的尺寸，共有一百四十四肘。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.17.htm">21:17</a>）<br />别处：<br />凡有聪明的，可以算计兽的数目，因为这是人的数目。他的数目是六百六十六。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.18.htm">13:18</a>）<br />显然，首先提到的数字，即“144”是12乘12的结果；数字“666”则包含3或6；但从数字“12”（参看<a href="577.htm">577</a>，<a href="2089.htm">2089</a>，<a href="2129.htm">2129</a>e，<a href="2130.htm">2130</a>e，<a href="3272.htm">3272</a>，<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="3913.htm">3913</a>节）和数字“3”（<a href="720.htm">720</a>，<a href="901.htm">901</a>，<a href="1825.htm">1825</a>，<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="4010.htm">4010</a>节）的神圣可以看出，它们包含何等神圣的事物在里面。<br />数字“三”因表示甚至直到结束的完整事物，因而表示一段时期，无论这个时期是长还是短，故在代表教会中被接受，并且每当需要传达这种含义时就会被用到。这个数字以同样的方式用在圣言中，而圣言中的每个细节都具有一个属灵含义，这从下面的例子可以看出来：<br />他们必走三天的路程，为要祭祀。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出3.18.htm">3:18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出5.3.htm">5:3</a>）<br />到第三天要预备好了，因为第三天耶和华要降临在西乃山上。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出19.11.htm">19:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出19.15.htm">15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出19.16.htm">16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出19.18.htm">18</a>）<br />所剩下的祭肉，要留到第三天。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利7.16.htm">7:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利7.18.htm">18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利19.6.htm">19:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利19.7.htm">7</a>）<br />在第三天和第七天，要把这除污秽的水洒在不洁净的人身上。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民19.11.htm">19:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民19.22.htm">22</a>）<br />凡摸了战争中被杀的，第三日、第七日，都要洁净自己。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民31.19.htm">31:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民31.25.htm">25</a>）<br />约书亚吩咐百姓三日之内过这约旦河。（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书1.11.htm">1:11</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/书3.2.htm">3:2</a>）<br />耶和华三次呼唤撒母耳，撒母耳三次跑到以利那里，第三次以利才明白是耶和华呼唤撒母耳。（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上3.1.htm">3:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上3.8.htm">8</a>）<br />约拿单叫大卫藏在田野，直到第三日晚上。明日，就是第三日，约拿单打发人到大卫那里，透露他父亲的意思。约拿单要向磐石旁边射三箭；这事以后，大卫在约拿单面前俯伏在地，拜了三拜。（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上20.5.htm">20:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上20.12.htm">12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上20.19.htm">19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上20.20.htm">20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上20.35.htm">35</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上20.36.htm">36</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上20.41.htm">41</a>）<br />有三样灾给大卫选择：这地有七年的饥荒；他在敌人面前被追赶三个月；这地有三日的瘟疫。（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下24.11.htm">24:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下24.13.htm">13</a>）<br />罗波安对求从他父亲的重轭得轻松的以色列的会众说：他们要离去三天再来；他们在第三日来见罗波安；他们遵着王所说你们第三日再来见我的命令，第三日来见罗波安。（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上12.5.htm">12:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上12.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上12.12.htm">12</a>）<br />以利亚三次伏在寡妇的孩子身上。（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上17.21.htm">17:21</a>）<br />以利亚吩咐百姓第三次倒水在燔祭上和柴上，他们就倒第三次。（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上18.34.htm">18:34</a>）<br />约拿在鲸鱼腹中三日三夜。（约拿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/拿1.17.htm">1:17</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.40.htm">12:40</a>）<br />主论到说，有人栽了一个葡萄园，三次打发仆人去，后来打发他的儿子去。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.2.htm">12:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.4.htm">4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.6.htm">6</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路20.12.htm">20:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路20.13.htm">13</a>）<br />祂论到彼得说，他要三次不认祂。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.34.htm">26:34</a>；约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.38.htm">13:38</a>）<br />祂三次对彼得说，你爱我吗？（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约21.15.htm">21:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约21.17.htm">17</a>）<br />从这些，以及圣言中许多其它经文可以看出，数字“3”含有某个奥秘在里面，因此这个数字在古代众教会当中作为一个有意义的符号而被采用。显然，它表示教会和教会事物的一个完整时期，无论这个时期是长还是短；因此，它还表示完整的事物，以及甚至持续到结束的事物，这一点明显可见于何西阿书：<br />过两天耶和华必使我们苏醒，第三天祂必使我们兴起，我们就在祂面前得以存活。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何6.2.htm">6:2</a>）</p>

And it came to pass on the third day. That this signifies what is continuous even to the end, is evident from the signification of the "third day," as being what is complete from beginning to end (see 
n. 2788), thus also what is continuous. That this is the signification of the "third day," can scarcely be believed by those who regard the historicals of the Word as mere worldly histories, holy merely 
because they are in the sacred volume. But that not only the historicals of the Word themselves enfold within them spiritual and heavenly things which are not apparent in the letter, but that so 
also do all the words, and even all the numbers, has been shown in the preceding explications; that such is really the case will of the Lord's Divine mercy become still more evident in the prophetic parts, 
which do not keep the mind so closely engaged with the succession of statements in the sense of the letter as do the historical parts. But that the number "three," also the number "seven," and the 
number "twelve," enfold deep secrets within them, must be evident to everyone who examines the Word in regard to its interiors; and if these numbers are so full of significance, it follows that there 
must be something deeply hidden in all the other numbers that occur in the Word, for the Word is holy throughout. [2] Sometimes when speaking with angels, as it were written numbers appeared before 
my eyes like those seen on paper in bright day, and I perceived that the very things they were speaking of fell into such numbers; and from this experience I learned that every number mentioned in the 
Word holds within it some mystery, as is very evident from the following passages: </p>
<p>     He measured the wall of the Holy Jerusalem a hundred and forty-four cubits, which is the measure of a man, that 
is, of an angel (Rev. 21:17).      He that hath intelligence let him compute the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred and sixty six (Rev. 13:18). That 
the number first mentioned-"144"-results from the multiplication of twelve into itself, and that the number "666" is a product of three and six, is manifest, but what holy thing they enfold within them 
may appear from the holiness of the number "twelve" (see n. 577, 2089, 2129, 2130, 3272, 3858, 3913), and of the number "three" (n. 720, 901, 1825, 2788, 4010). [3] This latter number-"three"-being 
significative of what is complete even to the end, thus of one period, great or small, was received in the representative church, and was employed whenever such a thing was signified; and also in the 
Word (in which all things have a signification both in general and in particular) as may be seen from the following instances: </p>
<p>     That they should go three days' journey and should sacrifice (Exod. 
3:18; 5:3).      That they should be ready against the third day, because on the third day Jehovah would come down upon Mount Sinai (Exod. 19:11, 15-16, 18).      That nothing should be left of 
the flesh of the sacrifice until the third day (Lev. 7:16-18; 19:6-7).      That the water of separation should be sprinkled upon the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day (Num. 19:11-22).  
    That they who touched one slain in war should be purified on the third day and on the seventh day (Num. 31:19-25).  That Joshua commanded the people to pass over Jordan within three days (Josh. 
1:11; 3:2).      That Jehovah called Samuel three times, and Samuel ran to Eli three times, and Eli understood the third time that Jehovah had called Samuel (1 Sam. 3:1-8).      That Jonathan said 
to David that he should hide himself in the field unto the third day at even, and that Jonathan sent to him on the third morrow, and revealed the disposition of his father; and that Jonathan then shot 
three arrows at the side of the stone; and that after this David bowed himself three times to the earth before Jonathan (1 Sam. 20:5, 12, 19,20, 35,36, 41).      That three things were offered to David 
to chose from: that there should come seven years of famine, that he should flee three months before his enemies, or that there should be three days' pestilence in the land (2 Sam. 24:11-13).    
  That Rehoboam said to the congregation of Israel who sought to be relieved from the yoke of his father, that they should go away three days, and come again; and that they came to Rehoboam the third 
day, as the King bade, saying, Come to me again the third day (1 Kings 12:5, 12).      That Elijah stretched himself upon the widow's son three times (1 Kings 17:21).      That Elijah told the people 
to pour water upon the burnt-offering and the wood the third time, and they did it the third time (1 Kings 18:34).      That Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights (Jonah 1:17; 
Matt. 12:40).      That the Lord spoke of a man who planted a vineyard and sent his servants three times, and afterwards his son (Mark 12:2, 4-6; Luke 20:12-13).      That He said of Peter that 
he should deny Him thrice (Matt. 26:34; John 13:38).      That He said to Peter three times, Lovest thou Me? (John 21:15-17). From these and many other places in the Word it may be seen that there 
was some mystery in the number "three," and that therefore this number was received among the significatives in the ancient churches. That it signifies an entire period of the church and of the things 
in the church, whether great or small, is manifest; and that it consequently signifies what is complete and also continuous to the end, is very plain in Hosea: </p>
<p>     Jehovah will vivify us after two 
days; on the third day He will raise us up, and we shall live before Him (Hos. 6:2). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4495</b></p><p><b>4495.</b>
'It happened on the third day' means that which is continuous even to the end. This is clear from the meaning of 'the third day' as that which is complete from beginning to end, dealt with in <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, and 
so also as that which is continuous. People who suppose that the historical events described in the Word are no more than the facts of earthly history and are holy only because they appear in a sacred 
book are scarcely able to believe that 'the third day' has that meaning. But, as shown in preceding explanations, it is not only the actual historical narratives that include spiritual and celestial 
things which are not plainly visible in the letter, but also every word and every number too. The truth of this will in the Lord's Divine mercy be seen far more clearly in the prophetical sections 
which in the sense of the letter do not hold the mind to the sequence of events in the way that the historical sections do. But anyone who looks carefully into the interior contents of the Word comes 
to see that the number three, like the number seven, and also the number twelve, holds some arcanum. And if these numbers hold such it follows that every other number in the Word holds the same, for the 
Word is holy in every part. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Sometimes, when I have been talking to angels, I have seen in front of me what looked like numbers written, as if on a sheet of paper, in broad daylight, and I have 
realized that the spiritual entities about which the angels spoke pass into numbers like these. From this experience I have also been given to know that each number in the Word contains some arcanum. 
This may be seen plainly from the following in John, </p>
<blockquote>
He measured the wall of the holy Jerusalem, a hundred and forty-four cubits, which is the measure of a man, that is, of an angel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2021:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 21:17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And 
elsewhere, </p>
<blockquote>
Let him who has intelligence reckon the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, that is, its number is six hundred and sixty-six. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2013:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 13:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>It is evident that the 
first of these numbers, namely a hundred and forty-four, is the product of twelve times twelve, and that the number six hundred and sixty-six is a product of that involving three or six; but what degree 
of holiness is implied by them may be seen from the holiness associated with the number twelve, concerning which number see <a href="577.htm">577</a>, <a href="2089.htm">2089</a>, <a href="2129.htm">2129</a> (end), <a href="2130.htm">2130</a> (end), <a href="3272.htm">3272</a>, <a href="3858.htm">3858</a>, <a href="3913.htm">3913</a>; and concerning the 
holiness associated with the number three, <a href="720.htm">720</a>, <a href="901.htm">901</a>, <a href="1825.htm">1825</a>, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="4010.htm">4010</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Because the number three meant that which is complete even to the end, and so an entire period, whether long or short, it 
was therefore adopted in the representative Church and used whenever such a meaning needed to be conveyed. It is also used in the same way in the Word, in which every detail carries a spiritual meaning, 
as may be seen from the following places: </p>
<p> They were to go a three days' journey and to offer sacrifice. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%203:18;%205:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 3:18; 5:3</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
They were to be ready on the third day, for on the third day Jehovah 
would come down onto Mount Sinai. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2019:11,%2015,%2016,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 19:11, 15, 16, 18</a>.

Nothing from the flesh of a sacrifice was to be left until the third day. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%207:16-18;%2019:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 7:16-18; 19:6, 7</a>.

 From these and many other places in the Word it becomes clear that the number three holds an arcanum within 
it, and that for this reason this number was adopted within the ancient Churches as a meaningful sign. It is evident that it means the entire period of a Church and of things within a Church, whether 
long or short, and therefore that which is complete and also that which is continuous even to the end, as is plain in Hosea, </p>
<p>Jehovah will revive us after two days, on the third day He will raise 
us up, and we shall live before Him. Hosea 6:2. </p>

{8} potest ab his apud Johannem,           Mensus est murum sanctae Hierosolymae centum      quadraginta quatuor cubitorum, quae est mensura hominis, hoc      est, angeli, Apoc. xxi 17: </p>
<p>et alibi,  
         Qui habet intelligentiam, computato numerum bestiae,      numerus enim hominis est, nempe numerus ejus est sexcenta      sexaginta sex, xiii 18; </p>
<p>quod prior numerus, nempe centum quadraginta 
quatuor sit ex duodecim in se multiplicatis et quod numerus sexcenta sexaginta sex sit ex numero ternario (o)et seno, patet; quid `sancti autem' involvant, constare potest ex sancto numeri duodecim, 
de quo {9} videatur n. 577, 2089, 2129 f., 2130 f., 3272, 3858, 3913, et de sancto numeri ternarii, n. 720, 901, 1825, 2788, 4010; [3] hic numerus, `nempe' ternarius, quia significabat {10} completum 
usque ad finem, ita unam periodum magnam vel parvam, ideo in Ecclesia repraesentativa receptus est, et adhibebatur quoties tale significaretur, (o)etiam in Verbo in quo omnia et singula significant, 
ut constare potest ab his locis {11; </p>
<p>          (m)Quod irent iter trium dierum et sacrificarent,      Exod. iii 18: v 3: </p>
<p>          quod parati essent ad (t)diem tertium, quia die tertio  
    descenderet Jehovah super montem Sinai, Exod. xix 11, 15,      16, 18: </p>

<p>          quod 
super immundum spargeretur aqua separationis die      tertio et die septimo, Num. xix 11 ad fin.: </p>
<p>          et quod qui tetigerunt occisum in bello, mundarentur      die tertio et die septimo, Num. 
xxxi 19-25(n): </p>
<p>          [4] quod Joshua mandaverit populo ut intra tres dies      transirent Jordanem, Jos. i 11; iii 2: </p>
<p>          quod Jehovah ter vocaverit Samuelem, et ter Samuel      cucurrerit 
ad Eli, et quod tertia vice intellexerit Eli quod      Jehovah vocaret Samuelem, 1 Sam. iii 1-8: </p>
<p>          quod Jonathan diceret ad Davidem, quod occultaret se in      agro ad vesperam tertiam; 
(o)et quod Jonathan mitteret ad      illum crastino tertio, et revelaret animum patris sui: et      quod Jonathan tunc ad latus lapidis jacularetur tres      sagittas: et quod post illud David se 
incurvaverit tribus      vicibus ad terram coram Jonathane, 1 Sam. xx 5, 12, 19, 20,      35, 36, 41: </p>
<p>          quod tria proposita sint Davidi, ut ex illis unum      eligeret, vel quod ventura fames 
septem annis, vel tribus      mensibus fugiturus pro hostibus, vel futura tribus diebus      pestis in terra, 2 Sam. xxiv 11-13           [5] quod Rehabeam diceret ad coetum Israelis, qui     
 petebant ut allevarentur a jugo patris ejus, quod abirent      tres dies et reverterentur; et quod venerint ad Rehabeamum      die tertio, sicut dixit rex, Revertimini ad me die tertio, 1      Reg. 
xii 5, 12: </p>
<p>          quod Elias se mensus super filium viduae tribus vicibus,      1 Reg. xvii 21: </p>
<p>          quod Elias dixerit, ut funderent aquam super      holocaustum et ligna tertia vice, et 
tertia vice fecerunt, 1      Reg. xviii 34           quod Jonas fuerit in ventre ceti tribus diebus et      tribus noctibus, Jon. ii 1 [A.V. i 17]; Matth. xii (x)40: </p>
<p>          quod Dominus locutus 
de homine qui plantavit vineam,      quod miserit tribus vicibus servos, et postea filium, Marc.      xii 2, 4-6; Luc. xx 12, 13           quod de Petro, quod ter abnegaturus Ipsum, Matth. xxvi  
    34; Joh.xiii 38: </p>
<p>          quod dixerit ad Petrum tribus vicibus, Amasne Me? Joh.      xxi 15-17. [6]  Ex his {12} et pluribus aliis in Verbo constare potest quod in numera ternario fuerit arcanum, 
et quod numerus ille {13} inde inter significativa {14} in Ecclesiis antiquis receptus sit; quod significet integram periodum Ecclesiae ac rerum in Ecclesia, ita magnam vel parvam, patet, proinde 
completum et quoque continuum usque ad finem; ut manifeste apud Hosheam,           Jehovah vivificabit nos post biduum, in {15} die tertio eriget {16} nos, et vivemus coram Ipso, vi 2.
