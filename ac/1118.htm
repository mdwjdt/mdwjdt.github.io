<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1118节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1118.</strong>凭借无法形容的某种流注，我还见识了那些人在世时所用的语言类型。它不象我们这个时代的有声语言那样发出声来，而是几不可闻，因为它是通过内呼吸而非外呼吸产生的。我还被允许感知其内呼吸的性质。它出自肚脐和心脏之间，然后经过嘴唇，没有任何声音。它不通过外在途径进入，震动所谓的耳膜，而是通过口内某个途径，实际上就是现代人所说的咽鼓管那个部位。我还得以见识到，他们用这种语言所能表达的内心情感和思想观念，远远比通过发声，或说话所表达的丰富得多，有声语言同样借助呼吸，不过，借助的却是外呼吸。若不借助呼吸，一个音节也无法传递。但对那些上古教会的人来说，做到这一点的方式要完美得多，因为是通过内呼吸完成的。由于内呼吸更加完美，所以它更适用和适合思想观念。此外，他们甚至通过嘴唇的动作和面部表情的相应变化来交流。因是属天之人，凡他们所思想的一切都从面部和眼睛的相应变化闪现出来。他们一点也不能做出与其思维不一致的面部表情来。伪装，尤其欺骗，在他们看来，是无法容忍的可怕罪孽。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1118.</strong> By means of a kind of inspiration I cannot describe, I was shown how they had talked when they were alive in the world. Their speech was not articulated, as the verbal speech we use today is, but silent, produced not by external but by internal breathing. I also had the opportunity to sense what their internal breathing was like. It moved from the navel to the heart and then out through the lips without a sound. It did not enter another person's ear from outside and vibrate on the part called the ear drum but traced a path through the mouth and in fact through a passageway there that we now call the Eustachian tube.<br />I was shown that this kind of speech enabled them to express the thoughts of their heart and the ideas in their minds much more fully than articulated sounds or audible words ever could. Audible sounds too travel on the breath (external breath, though), because no word contains any element that can be conveyed without the use of breath. But the process was much more perfect with them, because it relied on internal breathing. Since internal breathing takes place on a deeper plane, it is more perfect and better adapted to the actual ideas in our heads.<br />In addition, they used subtle motions of the lips and corresponding facial changes. Since they were a heavenly kind of people, everything they thought shone out from their face and eyes, which altered to suit the thought. They were completely incapable of any facial expression that did not agree with their thinking. They considered pretense a heinous crime and deceit even worse. </p>

There was shown me by a certain influx which I cannot describe, what the nature of their speech was when they lived in this world-that it was not articulate, like the vocal speech of our time, but tacit; 
and was produced not by external but by internal respiration. It was also granted me to perceive the nature of their internal respiration-that it advanced from the navel toward the heart, and so 
through the lips, without sound; and that it did not enter into the ear of another and strike upon what is called the drum of the ear by an external way, but by a certain way within the mouth, in fact 
by a passage there which is now called the Eustachian tube. And it was shown me that by such speech they could much more fully express the sentiments of the mind and the ideas of thought than can possibly 
be done by articulate sounds, or vocal words, which likewise are directed by the respiration, but external. For there is nothing in any word that is not directed by applications of the respiration. 
But with them this was done much more perfectly, because by the internal respiration; which, from the fact that it is interior, is at once far more perfect, and more applicable and conformable to 
the very ideas of thought. Besides, they also conversed by slight movements of the lips, and correspondent changes of the face; for being celestial men, whatever they thought shone forth from their faces 
and eyes, which were varied conformably. They could by no means put on an expression of countenance different from that which was in agreement with their thoughts. Simulation, and still more deceit, 
was to them a monstrous iniquity. </p>

By means of a certain influx that I am unable to describe I have been shown the type of speech which those people employed when they lived in the world. It was not articulated, like the vocal speech 
of our own times, but was non-audible, produced not by external breathing but by means of internal breathing. I have also been allowed to ascertain the nature of their internal breathing. It came from 
between the navel and the heart and so through the lips without any sounds It did not enter someone else's ear by an external route, striking what is called the ear-drum, but by a certain route inside 
the mouth, and in point of fact by that part inside it which is nowadays called the Eustachian tube. I have also been shown that by means of this type of speech they were able to express far more fully 
the feelings present in the mind (animus) and the ideas comprising their thought (cogitatio) than can possibly be done by articulated sounds or spoken words, which are similarly delivered by means 
of breath, which however is external For not one syllable of any spoken word is delivered without the use of breath. But with those people of the Most Ancient Church it was delivered in a far more perfect 
way because it was done by means of internal breathing And because this interior breathing is also far more perfect, it is more applicable and appropriate to the actual ideas comprising thought. 
In addition they even communicated by movements of the lips and by corresponding changes of facial expression. For, being celestial people, whatever they were thinking shone out of their face and eyes 
which altered correspondingly. They were quite incapable of assuming facial expressions that did not accord with what they were thinking. Pretence, and still more deception, was to them something absolutely 
outrageous. </p>

Ostensum mihi per influxum quendam quem describere non possum, qualis illorum loquela fuit cum vixerunt in mundo, quod non articulata sicut loquela vocum nostri temporis sed quod tacita, quae fiebat 
non per respirationem externam sed per internam; appercipere etiam datum, qualis illorum respiratio interna fuit, quod processerit ab umbilico versus cor, et sic per labia, absque sonoro, et quod non 
intraverit in alterius aurem per viam externam et pulsaverit in quoddam quod vocatur tympanum auris, sed per viam quandam intra os, et quidem per quoddam ibi quod vocatur hodie tuba Eustachiana:  et 
ostensum, quod per talem loquelam multo plenius potuerint exprimere sensa animi et ideas cogitationis quam usquam fieri potest per sonos articulatos aut voces sonoras, quae similiter diriguntur per respirationem, 
sed externam; nam nihil in aliqua voce est quod non dirigitur per applicationes respirationis; sed apud illos multo perfectius, quia per respirationem internam; quae quia interior etiam multo 
perfectior est, et ipsis ideis cogitationis applicabilior et conformior.  Praeter etiam per labiorum motiunculas, et correspondentes faciei mutationes; nam, quoniam caelestes homines fuerunt, quicquid 
cogitabant, hoc a facie et oculis illorum elucebat, quae conformiter variabantur; nusquam potuerunt alium vultum praeferre quam secundum illa quae cogitabant; simulatio et magis adhuc dolus iis 
fuit facinus enorme. </p>
