<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4742节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4742.</strong>“就是他身上那件彩衣”表由源于良善的真理之性质所决定的表象之性质。这从“彩衣”的含义清楚可知，“彩衣”是指藉以认识并辨别属世层的属灵层的真理表象（<a href="4677.htm">4677</a>节），故在此是指这些表象的性质；因此，经上两次提到“（外）衣”，即“他们就剥了约瑟的外衣，就是那件彩衣”。这些表象的性质取决于源自良善的真理的性质，这一事实从在天堂之光，也就是在来世清晰可见的真理表象可知。来世除了经由天堂来自主，并从祂的神性真理发出的光外，并没有其它光；因为这神性真理在天使眼前显为光（<a href="2776.htm">2776</a>，<a href="3190.htm">3190</a>，<a href="3195.htm">3195</a>，<a href="3222.htm">3222</a>，<a href="3339.htm">3339</a>，<a href="3340.htm">3340</a>，<a href="3636.htm">3636</a>，<a href="3643.htm">3643</a>，<a href="3993.htm">3993</a>，<a href="4302.htm">4302</a>，<a href="4413.htm">4413</a>，<a href="4415.htm">4415</a>节）。这光照着对它的接受因各天使而异。天使的全部思维通过这光的多样性而形成，世人的思维也是如此，尽管世人没有意识到这一点；因为对世人来说，这光落入在他的属世人或外在人中来自尘世之光的物质形像或观念。因此，天堂之光在他里面模糊到他几乎不知道其理解力里面的光和视觉来自天堂之光的地步。但在来世，当眼睛的视觉不再依赖于尘世之光，而是依赖于天堂之光时，他的思维来自这一源头就变得显而易见。<br />当这光从天堂进入灵人界时，它在那里便以各种颜色的表象来显明自己，这些颜色的美丽、多样性和可爱，远远超越由尘世之光所产生的颜色（参看根据经历所阐述的颜色，<a href="1053.htm">1053</a>，<a href="1624.htm">1624</a>，<a href="3993.htm">3993</a>，<a href="4530.htm">4530</a>，<a href="4677.htm">4677</a>节）。由于来世的颜色由天堂之光形成，所以它们在起源上无非是源于良善的真理之表象。事实上，真理凭自己无法闪耀，因为唯独凭自己，它没有任何火焰；相反，良善是它的源头，或说它凭良善而闪耀，因为良善就像发光的火焰。因此，良善的性质决定了从它显现的真理的性质，真理的性质和它闪耀所凭的良善的性质是一样的。由此可见，“彩衣”在内义上是什么意思，即：表象的性质取决于源自良善的真理的性质；因为如前所示，这外衣所属的“约瑟”代表神性真理。</p>

The tunic of various colors that was on him. That this signifies the quality of the appearances as to truths from good, is evident from the signification of a "tunic of various colors," as being the 
appearances of truth by which the spiritual of the natural is known and distinguished (n. 4677), here therefore the quality of the appearances; for which reason also a tunic is twice mentioned - "they 
stripped Joseph of his tunic, the tunic of various colors." That the quality of appearances is according to the truths from good, may be seen from the appearances of truth when presented to view in the 
light of heaven, that is, in the other life, where there is no other light than that which comes through heaven from the Lord, and which comes forth from His Divine truth; for this before the eyes 
of angels appears as light (n. 2776, 3190, 3195, 3222, 3339, 3340, 3636, 3643, 3993, 4302, 4413, 4415). This light is varied with everyone according to the reception. All the thought of the angels is 
effected through the variegation of this light, as also is the thought of man, although he is not aware of it; because with man this light falls into material images or ideas, which, being in his natural 
or external man, are from the light of the world. Thus the light of heaven is obscured in him to such a degree that he scarcely knows that his intellectual light and sight are from it. But in the 
other life, when the sight of the eye is no longer in the light of the world, but in the light of heaven, it becomes manifest that his thought is from this source. [2] When this light passes from heaven 
into the world of spirits, it is there presented under the appearance of various colors, which in beauty, variety, and loveliness immeasurably surpass the colors which are from the light of the world. 
(See what was said above in regard to colors, from experience, n. 1053, 1624, 3993, 4530, 4677.) As the colors in the other life are from this source, they are in their origin nothing else than appearances 
of truth from good. For truth does not shine from itself, because there is nothing flaming in it alone; but it shines from good, for good is like a flame which gives forth light. Such therefore 
as the good is, such does the truth from it appear; and such as the truth is, in such a manner does it shine from good. From this it is evident what is signified in the internal sense by the tunic 
of various colors, namely, the quality of appearances as to truths from good; for by Joseph, to whom the tunic belonged, is represented Divine truth, as before shown. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4742</b></p><p><b>4742.</b>
'The tunic of various colours that was on him' means the nature of the appearances which is determined by that of the truths derived from good. This is clear from the meaning of 'the tunic of various 
colours' as appearances of truth by which the spiritual of the natural is recognized and distinguished, dealt with in <a href="4677.htm">4677</a>, here therefore the nature of those appearances; and for this reason the word 
'tunic' is used twice - 'they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the tunic of various colours'. The fact that the nature of these appearances is determined by that of the truths derived from good may be 
known from appearances of truth when these are manifested visually in the light of heaven, that is, in the next life. There no other light exists than that which comes from the Lord by way of heaven and 
which emanates from His Divine Truth; for this appears before the eyes of the angels as light, <a href="2776.htm">2776</a>, <a href="3190.htm">3190</a>, <a href="3195.htm">3195</a>, <a href="3222.htm">3222</a>, <a href="3339.htm">3339</a>, <a href="3340.htm">3340</a>, <a href="3636.htm">3636</a>, <a href="3643.htm">3643</a>, <a href="3993.htm">3993</a>, <a href="4302.htm">4302</a>, <a href="4413.htm">4413</a>, <a href="4415.htm">4415</a>. This light varies with each angel, 
depending on his reception of it. Angels' entire thought is formed by the variegation of that light, as also is man's thought, though he is not conscious of this because in man's case that light 
falls onto material images or ideas present in his natural or external man which are formed from the light of the world. </p>
<p>Consequently in his case the light of heaven is dimmed to such an extent that 
he scarcely knows that the light and sight in his understanding are a product of the light of heaven. But in the next life when the sight of the eye is no longer reliant on the light of the world but 
on that of heaven it is then obvious that his thought is formed from the latter. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 When this light passes from heaven into the world of spirits it manifests itself there in the form of various 
colours, the beauty, variation, and loveliness of these colours being immensely superior to the colours produced by the light of the world; see what has already been presented from experience regarding 
colours, in <a href="1053.htm">1053</a>, <a href="1624.htm">1624</a>, <a href="3993.htm">3993</a>, <a href="4530.htm">4530</a>, <a href="4677.htm">4677</a>. Because colours in the next life are formed from the light of heaven they are in origin nothing else than appearances of truth derived from good. The source 
from which truth shines is not truth itself because by itself alone it does not possess any flame; rather, good is the source of it since this is like the flame from which light shines. The nature of 
good therefore determines the nature of the truth that appears from it, and the nature of the truth is the same as that of the good from which it shines. From this one may see what is meant in the internal 
sense by 'the tunic of various colours' - that the nature of the appearances is determined by that of the truths derived from good; for as shown already, 'Joseph', to whom the tunic belonged, represents 
Divine Truth. </p>

`Tunica variorum colorum, quae super eum':  quod significet apparentiarum quale quoad vera ex bono, constat ex significatione `tunicae variorum colorum' quod sint apparentiae veri, ex quibus spirituale 
naturalis cognoscitur et distinguitur, de qua n. 4677, hic ideo apparentiarum quale, quapropter etiam bis dicitur tunica, nempe `exuebant Josephum tunica sua, tunica variorum colorum.'  Quod 
apparentiarum quale se habeat secundum vera ex bono, constare potest ex apparentiis veri, cum ad visum sistuntur in luce caeli, hoc est, in altera vita, ubi non alia lux est quam quae venit per caelum 
a Domino, et quae existit ex Divino Ipsius Vero, hoc enim coram oculis angelorum apparet ut lux, (o)n. 2776, 3190, 3195, 3222, 3339, 3340, 3636, 3643, 3993, 4302, 4413, 4415; variatur haec lux 
apud unumquemvis secundum receptionem; omnis cogitatio angelorum fit per variegationem illius lucis, sicut etiam cogitatio hominis, tametsi homo hoc nescit quia apud hominem cadit lux illa in imagines 
seu ideas materiales quae in naturali seu externo ejus homine sunt ex luce mundi; inde apud eum in tantum obscuratur illa lux ut vix sciat quod lux et visus ejus intellectualis sit inde; at in 
altera vita, cum visus oculi non amplius est in luce mundi sed in luce caeli, tunc se manifestat quod cogitatio ejus sit inde.  [2] Haec lux cum e caelo transit in mundum spirituum, sistitur ibi sub 
specie variorum colorum, qui colores pulchritudine, varietate et amoenitate {1} immensum excedunt colores qui sunt ex luce mundi, videantur quae prius de coloribus ab experientia n. 1053, 1624, 3993, 
4530, 4677 allata sunt; quia colores in altera vita inde existunt, sunt in origine sua non aliud quam apparentiae veri ex bono; verum enim ex se non lucet quia ei soli nihil flammeum inest, sed 
ex bono, hoc enim est instar flammae ex qua lux, quale itaque est bonum tale inde apparet verum, et quale est verum taliter a bono lucet.  Inde patet quid per `tunicam variorum colorum' in sensu 
interno significatur, quod nempe apparentiarum quale quoad vera ex bono; per `Josephum' enim cui tunica, repraesentatur Divinum Verum, ut prius ostensum.      @1 amoenitate, pulchritudine et varietate$ </p>
