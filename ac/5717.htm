<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5717节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5717.</strong>有些灵人不仅与大脑中极其黏稠的物质，也就是大脑中的废物有关，而且还知道如何用类似毒药的东西污染这些物质。这类灵人一到来，就冲进颅骨里面，甚至由此继续一刻不停地直入脊髓。那些内层还没有打开的人感觉不到这一点；但我蒙允许清楚感觉到他们的侵入，以及毁灭我的努力；然而，这一切都是徒劳的，因为主正在保护我。他们企图夺走我的全部理解力；我明显感觉到他们的活动，以及由此而来的痛苦；然而，这痛苦很快就停止了。后来，我与这些灵人交谈，他们被迫坦白他们从哪里来。他们说，他们住在黑暗的森林里；在那里，他们根本不敢对他们的同伴做任何事，因为如果他们胆敢做任何事，他们的同伴就被允许残忍地对待他们。他们就这样被关了起来；他们都很丑陋，脸就像野兽，并且浑身是毛。<br />我被告知，他们就像从前杀戮整个军队的人，如我们在圣言中所读到的。他们冲进每个人的脑细胞，在那里制造恐惧，连同叫人彼此杀戮的那种疯狂。如今，这类灵人被关在他们自己的地狱里，没有被放出来。这些灵人还与颅骨里面的头部恶性肿瘤有关。我在前面说过，他们冲进颅骨里面，由此继续一刻不停地直入脊髓；但要知道，这些灵人自己冲进来只是一种表象。事实上，他们是沿着身体之外对应于身体里面的这些区域的路径而来的；但感觉好像他们的力量在里面。这种感觉是由对应造成的，因为对应使得他们的运作能集中于它所针对的人。</p>

There are some who not only relate to the most viscid substances of the brain, which are its excremental things, but also know how to infect them as if with poisons. When such spirits arrive they rush 
within the skull, and thence by continuity even into the spinal marrow. This cannot be felt by those whose interiors are not open. It has been given me plainly to feel the inroad, and also the effort 
to destroy me; but this was vain, because I was protected by the Lord. They strove to take away from me all the capacity of the intellect. I plainly felt their operation, and felt also pain from it, 
which however soon ceased. I afterward spoke to them, and they were compelled to confess whence they were. They said that they lived in dark forests, where they durst not injure their companions, because 
in that case their companions were allowed to treat them cruelly. Thus they are kept in bonds. They are ugly, having the face of a wild beast, and hairy. I was told that they are such as had formerly 
slain whole armies, as we read in the Word; for they rushed into the chambers of everyone's brain, and inspired terror, together with such madness that they killed each other. At the present day 
such spirits are kept shut up within their own hell, and are not let out. These too bear relation to deadly tumors of the head within the skull. It was said above that they rush within the skull and by 
continuity therefrom even into the spinal marrow; but be it known that it is only an appearance that the spirits themselves rush in, they being borne along outside by a way which corresponds to the 
spaces in question within the body, which is felt within as if there were an inroad. This sensation is caused by correspondence, from which their operation is easily brought to bear upon the man to whom 
it is directed. </p>

There are spirits who not only correlate with the very sticky substances in the brain, which are its waste products, but who also know how to infect those substances with what are like poisons. On arrival 
spirits of this kind charge inside the skull and continue without stopping right on into the spinal cord. This is not something that people whose interiors have not been opened are able to feel; 
but I have been allowed to feel them entering in, and to feel their endeavour to destroy, which however was to no avail because the Lord was protecting me. Their intention was to remove my entire power 
of understanding from me; I felt their activity clearly as well as the resulting pain, which however soon ceased. When I spoke to those spirits subsequently they were compelled to confess where they 
were from. They said they lived in dark forests where they do not dare to do anything at all to their companions, for if they do do anything their companions are allowed to treat them cruelly. Thus 
they are kept in bonds; and they are ugly, having faces that look like wild beasts, and they are covered with hair. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 I have been told that those in former times who slew entire armies, such as one 
reads about in the Word, were like them. They charged into the cells of each man's brain and introduced terror there, together with a kind of madness that caused one man to slay another. At the present 
day such spirits are kept locked up in their own hell and are not let out. They also correlate with malignant swellings of the head inside the skull. I have described those spirits as ones that charge 
inside the skull and continue without stopping right on into the spinal cord; but it should be realized that this charging in by them is an appearance. They are actually conveyed along a route outside 
the body which corresponds to those areas inside it; but it feels as though the force of them were inside. Correspondence is the explanation for this, for it enables the operation they are carrying 
out to be concentrated on the person at whom it is directed. </p>

Sunt quidam qui non solum viscosissima cerebri quae excrementitia ejus sunt, referunt, sed etiam sciunt inficere illa quasi venenis; tales cum alluunt, irruunt intra cranium et inde per continuum usque 
in medullam spinalem; hoc sentire non possunt illi quibus interiora non aperta sunt; mihi dabatur manifeste sentire illapsum, et quoque conatum, nempe interimendi, sed incassum quia tutus a Domino; 
intendebant omnem facultatem intellectualem mihi auferre, sensi manifeste operationem eorum et quoque inde dolorem, qui tamen mox cessabat; postea cum illis locutus sum, et coacti sunt fateri unde essent; 
narrabant se vivere in obscuris silvis ubi non audent quicquam sociis inferre, quoniam tunc licet sociis immaniter illos tractare; ita tenentur in vinculis; sunt deformes, facie ferina, hirsuti. 
[2]Dictum mihi quod tales fuerint qui olim integros exercitus necarunt, sicut legitur in Verbo; irruerunt enim in cameras cerebri cujusvis, et intulerunt terrorem, una cum tali insania ut unus necaret 
alterum; tales hodie intra infernum suum clausi tenentur nec emittuntur.  Referunt etiam tubera lethalia capitis intra cranium (m)Dictum quod irruant intra cranium et inde per continuum usque in medullam 
spinalem, sed sciendum quod apparentia sit quod ipsi spiritus irruant; feruntur extra per viam quae in corpore illis spatiis correspondet, quod sentitur sicut illapsus foret intra; correspondentia 
hoc facit; inde operatio eorum facile derivatur in hominem ad quem determinatur.(n) </p>
