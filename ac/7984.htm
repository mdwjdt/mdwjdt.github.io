<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7984.</strong>“共有四百三十年”表它们的性质和状态。这从“三十”和“四百”的含义清楚可知：“三十”是指一个完全的余留状态，或说余留的数量变得完全之时的一种状态，因为这个数字是三和十的乘积，而“三”表示一个完全状态（<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="4495.htm">4495</a>，<a href="7715.htm">7715</a>节），“十”表示余留（<a href="576.htm">576</a>，<a href="1906.htm">1906</a>，<a href="2284.htm">2284</a>节），接下来就会解释何为一个完全状态；“四百”是指荒凉持续的时间（<a href="2959.htm">2959</a>，<a href="2966.htm">2966</a>节），由此是指良善与真理的结合（<a href="4341.htm">4341</a>节）。所有数字都表示真实事物和状态，一个复合数字具有和构成它的简单数字相似的含义（参看<a href="7973.htm">7973</a>节）。<br />至于“四百年”所表示的荒凉，荒凉有两种，即邪恶和虚假的荒凉，以及良善和真理和荒凉。对那些遭受诅咒的人来说，这是良善和真理的荒凉；但对那些正在得救的人来说，这是邪恶和虚假的荒凉；荒凉就是剥夺这些事物。前面早已说明，曾属于教会的恶人经受一切良善和真理的荒凉；埃及的灾殃就表示一个接一个的荒凉阶段。但善人经受邪恶和虚假的荒凉；与他们同在的邪恶和虚假逐渐被分离出去，也就是被抛到周边；良善和真理则被聚集到中间。“余留”这个词就用来描述良善和真理的这种聚集；当他们的余留状态变得完全时，善人就被提入天堂。这种状态就是“三十”所表示的，而荒凉则是“四百”所表示的。对善人来说，邪恶和虚假的荒凉，并良善和真理的灌输是通过侵扰和试探实现的。通过这一个，虚假和邪恶被移除；通过那一个，良善和真理被披上或嵌入；这个过程一直持续到状态变得完全。<br />必须简要解释一下何为一个完全状态。每个人，无论受到诅咒的还是得救的，都有能变得完全的一定量。恶人或那些受到诅咒的人有邪恶和虚假的一定的量；善人或那些得救的人则有良善和真理的一定的量。在来世，每个人所拥有的这个量都会变得完全；只是有些人的量可能变得相当大，而有些人的量则变得相当小。在世上，人们通过属于其爱的情感获得这个量。人越爱邪恶和邪恶所生的虚假，他们为自己所获得的量就越大；人越爱良善和源于这良善的真理，他的量就越大。这个量所能延伸到的极限和程度在来世是显而易见的，并且在那里无法被超越；但它们能被充满，事实上也被充满了。也就是说，对那些拥有对良善和真理的情感之人来说，他们的量充满良善和真理；而对那些拥有对邪恶和虚假的人来说，他们的量充满邪恶和虚假。由此明显可知，这个量是在世上要么为了接受邪恶和虚假，要么接受良善和真理所获得的一种能力或习性。<br />这种状态就是“一个完全的状态”所指的，也是“三十”所表示的。主在马太福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.14.htm">25:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.30.htm">30</a>）中以他连得的比喻，在路加福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路19.12.htm">19:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路19.27.htm">27</a>）中以锭的比喻，最后以这些话描述了该状态：<br />凡有的，还要给他，叫他充足有余。没有的，连他所有的，也要从他夺过来。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.29.htm">25:29</a>）<br />路加福音：<br />祂就对旁边站着的人说，夺过他这一锭来，给那有十锭的。他们对他说，主啊，他已经有十锭了。我告诉你们，凡有的，还要加给他；没有的，连他所有的也要夺过来。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路19.24.htm">19:24</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路19.26.htm">26</a>）<br />每个人的量都会充满，变得完全，主在路加福音的另一处也教导了这一点：<br />你们要给人，就必有给你们的，必用好的量器，连摇带按，上尖下流地倒在你们怀里。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路6.38.htm">6:38</a>）<br />由此可见一个完全的状态是什么意思。</p>

Was thirty years and four hundred years. That this signifies the quality and state of these, is evident from the signification of "thirty," as being a full state of remains, for this number is the product 
of three and ten multiplied together, and by "three" is signified a full state (n. 2788, 4495, 7715), and by "ten," remains (n. 576, 1906, 2284); what a full state is shall be told presently; and 
from the signification of "four hundred," as being the duration of vastation (n. 2959, 2966), and the consequent conjunction of good and truth (n. 4341). (That all numbers signify things and states, 
and that a compound number has a similar signification to that of the simple numbers of which it is compounded, see above, n. 7973.) [2] As regards the vastation which is signified by "four hundred 
years," it is twofold, namely, the vastation of evil and falsity, and the vastation of good and truth. With those who are being damned it is the vastation of good and truth; but with those who are saved, 
it is the vastation of evil and falsity. Vastation is deprivation. That the evil who had been of the church were vastated as to all good and truth, has already been shown; for the successive degrees 
of vastation were signified by the plagues in Egypt. But the good are vastated as to evil and falsity; with them these are successively separated, that is, rejected to the sides, and goods and truth 
are brought together toward the midst. This collecting together of good and truth is meant by "remains;" and when they have a full state of remains, they are then raised into heaven. This state is that 
which is signified by "thirty," and the vastation by "four hundred." The vastation of evil and falsity, and the instilling of good and truth, with the good, are effected by means of infestations, 
and by means of temptations. By the one, falsities and evils are removed; and by the other, goods and truths, are put on; and this even until the state becomes full. [3] It must also be told briefly 
what a full state is. Everyone, whether damned or saved, has a certain measure which is capable of being filled. The evil, or they who are damned, have a certain measure of evil and falsity; and the good, 
or they who are saved, have a certain measure of good and truth. In the other life this measure is filled with everyone; but some have a greater measure, some a less. This measure is acquired in 
the world by means of the affections which are of the love. The more anyone has loved evil and the derivative falsity, the greater is the measure he has gained for himself; and the more anyone has loved 
good and the derivative truth, the greater is his measure. The limits and degrees of the extensions of this measure are clearly seen in the other life, and cannot there be surmounted, but they can 
be filled, and also actually are filled, namely, with goods and truths in the case of those who have been in the affection of good and truth, and with evils and falsities in the case of those who have 
been in the affection of evil and falsity. Hence it is evident that this measure is the faculty gained in the world for receiving either evil and falsity, or good and truth. [4] This state is what is 
meant by a "full state," and is signified by "thirty." It is described by the Lord in the parables of the talents in Matt. 25:14-30, and of the pounds in Luke 19:12-27, and finally in these words: </p>
<p> 
    To everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance, but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away from him (Matt. 25:29).      He said unto them that stood 
by, Take away from him the pound, and give it to him who hath the ten pounds: they said to him, Lord, he hath ten pounds. I say to you, that unto everyone that hath shall be given; but from him that 
hath not even that which he hath shall be taken from him (Luke 19:24-26). That everyone's measure is filled, the Lord also teaches in another place in Luke: </p>
<p>     Give, and it shall be given unto you; 
good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, shall they give into your bosom (Luke 6:38). From all this it is now evident what is meant by a full state. </p>

'Four hundred and thirty years' means the essential nature and state of them. This is clear from the meaning of 'thirty' as a state when the quantity of remnants is complete, for that number is the product 
of three and ten multiplied, and 'three' means a state made complete, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="4495.htm">4495</a>, <a href="7715.htm">7715</a>, and 'ten' means remnants, <a href="576.htm">576</a>, <a href="1906.htm">1906</a>, <a href="2284.htm">2284</a> (what a state made complete is will be explained below); and from 
the meaning of 'four hundred' as the duration of vastation, dealt with in <a href="2959.htm">2959</a>, <a href="2966.htm">2966</a>, and from this the joining together of goodness and truth, <a href="4341.htm">4341</a>, The fact that all numbers mean real things and 
states, and that a compound number is similar to the simple ones of which it is a product, see above in <a href="7973.htm">7973</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards vastation, meant by 'four hundred years', there are two kinds, namely the 
vastation of evil and falsity and the vastation of goodness and truth. With those suffering damnation it is the vastation of goodness and truth, but with those who are being saved it is the vastation 
of evil and falsity, vastation being the taking away of those things. So far it has been shown that the evil who have belonged to the Church undergo vastation of all goodness and truth, for stages of 
vastation one after another are meant by the plagues in Egypt. But the good undergo vastation of evil and falsity. Evil and falsity residing with them are gradually separated, that is, removed to the 
sides, and forms of good and truths are gathered towards the middle. The term 'remnants' is used to describe goodness and truth gathered together in that way. And when their state of remnants has been 
made complete the good are raised to heaven. This state is what is meant by 'thirty', and vastation what is meant by 'four hundred'. With the good the vastation of evil and falsity and the instilling 
of goodness and truth is effected by means of molestations and by means of temptations. By means of both these, falsities and evils are removed and forms of good and truths are inserted; and this process 
continues until the state is made complete. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 What a state made complete is must also be explained briefly. Everyone, whether damned or saved, has a certain measure that can be made complete. 
The evil, or those who are damned, have a certain measure of evil and falsity, while the good, or those who are saved, have a certain measure of goodness and truth. This measure that everyone has 
is made complete in the next life, though with some the measure may be quite large, with others rather small. People acquire that measure in the world through the affections belonging to their love. The 
more anyone has loved evil and the falsity arising from it, the greater is the measure acquired by him; and the more anyone has loved good and the truth springing from it, the greater is his measure. 
The breadths and heights to which that measure can go are clearly apparent in the next life. These limits cannot be exceeded there, but they can be reached, and in fact are reached; that is to say, 
those whose affection has been for goodness and truth have their measure made complete with forms of good and truths, while those whose affection has been for evil and falsity have theirs made complete 
with evils and falsities. From this it is evident that this measure is a propensity acquired in the world to receive either evil and falsity or goodness and truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 This state is what a state 
made complete refers to and what is meant by 'thirty'. It is described by the Lord in the parable of the talents, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matthew%2025:14-30&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matthew 25:14-30</a>, and in that of the minas, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2019:11-27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 19:11-27</a>, and at length by these words 
in Matthew, </p>
<p>To everyone who has, it will be given, so that he may have in abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2025:29&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 25:29</a>. </p>
<p>And in Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
To those standing 
by he said, Take the mina from him, and give to him who has ten minas. They said, Sir, he has ten minas. I say to you, that to everyone who has, it will be given; but from him who does not have, even 
what he has will be taken away from him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2019:24-26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 19:24-26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
That everyone's measure is made complete is the Lord's teaching elsewhere in the same gospel, Give, and it will be given to you; good measure, 
pressed down, shaken together, and running over they will give into your bosom. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%206:38&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 6:38</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From all this one may now see what is meant by a state made complete. </p>

`Triginta anni et (x)quadringenti anni': quod significet quale et statum illarum, constat ex significatione `triginta' quod sit status plenus reliquiarum, exsurgit enim ille numerus ex tribus et decem 
in se multiplicatis, et per `tria' significatur status plenus, n. 2788, 4495, 7715, perque `decem' reliquiae, n. 576, 1906, 2284; quid status plenus, in sequentibus dicetur; et ex significatione `quadringentorum' 
quod sint vastationis duratio, de qua n. 2959, 2966, et inde conjunctio boni et veri, n. 4341; quod omnes numeri significent res et status, et quod numerus compositus simile cum simplicibus 
ex quibus compositus est, videatur supra n. 7973. 	2 Quod vastationem, quae per `quadringentos annos' significatur, attinet, est illa duplex, nempe vastatio mali et falsi, et vastatio boni et veri; 
{1}apud illos qui damnantur est vastatio boni et veri, {2}at {1}apud illos qui salvantur est vastatio mali et falsi; vastatio est privatio; quod mali qui {3}ab Ecclesia fuerunt vastati sint quoad 
omne bonum et verum, hactenus ostensum est, nam {4}vastationis gradus successivi significati sunt per plagas in Aegypto; boni autem vastantur quoad malum et falsum; haec apud illos successive separantur, 
hoc est, rejiciuntur ad latera, ac bona et vera colligantur ad medium; haec collectio boni et veri intelligitur per `reliquias'; cumque status plenus reliquiarum illis est, tunc elevantur in caelum; 
hic status est qui significatur per `triginta,' (c)et vastatio per `quadringenta'; vastatio mali et falsi, ac {5}insinuatio boni et veri apud bonos, fit {6} per infestationes, {7}et per tentationes; 
per illas et has removentur falsa et mala, ac {8}induntur bona et vera; et hoc usque dum status plenus fit. 	3 Quid status plenus, paucis etiam dicendum est: unusquisque qui vel damnatur vel salvatur 
habet certam mensuram quae impleri potest; mali, seu qui damnantur, habent certam mensuram mali et falsi, ac boni, seu qui salvantur, habent certam mensuram boni et veri; haec mensura apud unumquemvis 
impletur in altera vita; {9}sed aliquibus est mensura major, aliquibus autem minor; mensura illa comparatur in mundo per affectiones quae sunt amoris, quo quis plus amaverat malum ac inde falsum, 
eo mensuram sibi majorem comparaverat; et quo quis plus amaverat bonum et inde verum, eo mensura illi major est; limites et gradus extensionis illius mensurae in altera vita manifeste apparent, ac non 
possunt ibi transcendi, sed possunt impleri, et quoque actualiter implentur, nempe bonis et veris apud illos qui in affectione boni et veri fuerunt, ac malis et falsis apud illos qui in affectione mali 
et falsi; inde patet quod mensura illa sit facultas recipiendi vel malum et falsum, vel bonum et verum, comparata in mundo; hic status est qui intelligitur per statum plenum, 4 et significatur per 
`triginta'; describitur ille a Domino in parabolis de talentis apud Matthaeum xxv 14-(x)30, et de minis apud Lucam xix (x)11-27; et tandem his verbis apud Matthaeum, Habenti omni dabitur ut abundet,
