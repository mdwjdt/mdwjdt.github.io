<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7831节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7831.</strong>“本月初十”表内层启动的状态。这从“初十”的含义清楚可知，“初十”（即“日”）是指内层的状态。因为“日”表示状态（<a href="23.htm">23</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="488.htm">488</a>，<a href="493.htm">493</a>，<a href="575.htm">575</a>，<a href="893.htm">893</a>，<a href="1738.htm">1738</a>，<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="3462.htm">3462</a>，<a href="3785.htm">3785</a>，<a href="4850.htm">4850</a>，<a href="5672.htm">5672</a>节），“十”表示余剩（<a href="576.htm">576</a>，<a href="1906.htm">1906</a>，<a href="2284.htm">2284</a>节），也就是被主储存在人之内层的真理和良善（<a href="1050.htm">1050</a>，<a href="1906.htm">1906</a>，<a href="2284.htm">2284</a>，<a href="5135.htm">5135</a>，<a href="5897.htm">5897</a>，<a href="7560.htm">7560</a>，<a href="7564.htm">7564</a>节）。由于余剩在内层中，人通过它们得到预备，并开始接受来自主的良善和真理，所以“初十日”在此表示内层启示的状态。人通过余剩重生，从而通过它们开始接受来自主的良善和真理的流注（参看<a href="5342.htm">5342</a>，<a href="5898.htm">5898</a>，<a href="6156.htm">6156</a>节）；人也通过它们与天堂接触（<a href="7560.htm">7560</a>节），因为这些良善和真理来自主，而非来自人（<a href="7564.htm">7564</a>节）。“月”表示从开始到结束的一个完整状态（<a href="3814.htm">3814</a>节），因而表示释放的整个状态，逾越节整体上表示释放。由此明显可知，“本月初十日”表示内层启动的状态。这种状态，即内层启动的状态，从这个月的初十日持续到该月的十四日；在这些日子里，逾越节羔羊要留着。“逾越节羔羊”表示纯真的良善，它是至内在的；因此，在此期间，这种至内在的良善，连同它所居住的内层要与诸如玷污它的那类事物隔绝，并远离它们。这种状态就是内层启动的状态，也就是预备接受来自主的良善与真理的流注的状态。这就是包含在这些话中的神圣含义；因为若没有这种神圣含义深藏在它们里面，经上就不会吩咐要在本月初十日取逾越节的动物，还要留到十四日；也不会吩咐之后要在在两个傍晚之间把它宰了；要必须用火烤，断不可用水煮；不可剩下一点留到早晨；要把剩下的用火烧了；它的骨头一根也不可折断；以及其它细节。凡深思这些要求的人都能知道，它们必涉及迄今为止谁也不知道的神圣事物；这些神圣事物是属教会和天堂，与神性有关的属灵事物，而圣言的每一个细节都是从神性降下来的。</p>

In the tenth of this month. That this signifies a state of initiation of the interiors, is evident from the signification of "the tenth" (namely "day") as being the state of the interiors; for by "day" 
is signified state (n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 575, 893, 1738, 2788, 3462, 3785, 4850, 5672), and by "ten" are signified remains (n. 576, 1906, 2284), that is, truths and goods stored up by the Lord in 
the interiors of man (n. 1050, 1906, 2284, 5135, 5897, 7560, 7564); and as remains are in the interiors, and by them man is prepared and initiated to receive good and truth from the Lord, therefore by 
"the tenth day" is here signified a state of initiation of the interiors. (That man is regenerated by means of remains, consequently is by them initiated into receiving the influx of good and truth from 
the Lord, see n. 5342, 5898, 6156; and that by means of them man communicates with heaven, n. 7560; for these goods and truths are from the Lord, and not from man, n. 7564.) By a "month" is signified 
an entire state from its beginning to its end (n. 3814), thus the whole state of liberation which is signified by the passover in the complex. From all this it is evident that by "in the tenth of 
this month" is signified a state of initiation of the interiors. This state, namely, of the initiation of the interiors, was from the tenth day of that month even to the fourteenth day thereof, within 
which days the paschal lamb was to be kept. By the paschal animal is signified the good of innocence, which is the inmost; thus it is signified that this inmost, together with the interiors in which 
it is, should meanwhile be secluded and withheld from such things as defile. This state is a state of initiation of the interiors, that is, of preparation to receive the influx of good and truth from 
the Lord. This is the holy thing which is contained in these words; for without something holy stored up within, it would not have been commanded that in the tenth day of the month the paschal animal 
should be taken, and should be kept even to the fourteenth, day; nor that afterward it should be killed between the evenings; and should be eaten roast with fire, not boiled with water; that they should 
not leave anything of it until the morning; that they should burn what was left with fire; that they should not break a bone of it; and other particulars, which everyone who ponders upon it may know 
must involve holy things hitherto unknown to anyone; and that these holy things are spiritual things, which are of the church and of heaven, and which relate to the Divine, from which every detail of 
the Word has come down. </p>

'On the tenth of this month' means the state of the initiation of the interiors. This is clear from the meaning of 'the tenth' - day, that is to say - as the state of the interiors. For 'day' means state, <a href="23.htm">23</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="488.htm">488</a>, <a href="493.htm">493</a>, <a href="576.htm">576</a>, <a href="893.htm">893</a>, <a href="1738.htm">1738</a>, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="3462.htm">3462</a>, <a href="3785.htm">3785</a>, <a href="4850.htm">4850</a>, <a href="5672.htm">5672</a>, and 'ten' means remnants, <a href="576.htm">576</a>, <a href="1906.htm">1906</a>, <a href="2284.htm">2284</a>, that is, the truths and forms of good stored away by the Lord in a person's interiors, 
<a href="1050.htm">1050</a>, <a href="1906.htm">1906</a>, <a href="2284.htm">2284</a>, <a href="5135.htm">5135</a>, <a href="5897.htm">5897</a>, <a href="7560.htm">7560</a>, <a href="7564.htm">7564</a>. And since the remnants reside in his interiors, and they are used to prepare the person for and initiate him into receiving goodness and truth from the Lord, 
'the tenth day' here means the state of the initiation of the interiors. With regard to a person's being regenerated by means of remnants, and so to his being initiated by means of them into receiving 
the inflow of goodness and truth from the Lord, see <a href="5342.htm">5342</a>, <a href="5898.htm">5898</a>, <a href="6156.htm">6156</a>, and with regard to his contact with heaven through them, <a href="7560.htm">7560</a>, for those forms of good and truths originate in the Lord, not in 
man, <a href="7564.htm">7564</a>. 'Month' is used to mean a whole state from start to finish, <a href="7814.htm">7814</a>, thus the complete state of deliverance, which the Passover in its entirety means. From all this it is evident that 'on the 
tenth of this month' means the state of the initiation of the interiors. This state - of the initiation of the interiors - lasted from the tenth day of that month through to the fourteenth day of it, 
between which days the Passover animal was to be held in safe keeping. 'The Passover animal' means the good of innocence, which is inmost; thus this good which is inmost, together with the interiors in 
which it resides, was in the meantime to be isolated and kept away from such things as defile it. This state is the state of the initiation of the interiors, that is, of being made ready to receive 
the inflow of goodness and truth from the Lord. This is the holy meaning contained in the words under consideration, for without that holy meaning deeply concealed within them no command would have been 
given for the Passover animal to be taken on the tenth of the month and held in safe keeping until the fourteenth day, or for it to be slaughtered after that between the evenings, and to be eaten roasted 
with fire and not boiled in water. Nor would they have been commanded not to leave any of it till morning, to burn with fire what remained, not to break a bone of it, and much else. These regulations, 
as anyone who ponders on them may recognize, have to do with things of a holy nature which no one is as yet acquainted with; and these holy things are spiritual ones that belong to the Church 
and heaven, and that are concerned with the Divine from whom every detail of the Word has come down. </p>

`In decimo mensis hujus': quod significet statum initiationis interiorum, constat ex significatione `decimi,' nempe diei, quod sit status interiorum, per `diem' enim significatur status, n. 23, 487, 
88, 493, 576 , 893, 1738, 2788, 3462, 3785, 4850, 5672, et per `decem' significantur reliquiae, n. 576, 1906, 2284, hoc est, {1}vera et bona in interioribus hominis a Domino recondita, {2} n. 1050, 1906, 
2284, 5135, 5897, 7560, 7564; et quia reliquiae sunt in interioribus, et homo per illas praeparatur et initiatur ad recipiendum bonum et verum a Domino, ideo per `decimum diem' hic significatur status 
initiationis interiorum; quod homo per reliquias regeneretur, proinde initietur ad recipiendum influxum boni et veri a Domino, videatur n. 5342, 5898, 6156, et quod per illas homo communicet cum 
caelo, n. 7560, nam {3}bona et vera illa sunt a Domino, et non ab homine, n. 7564; per `mensem' intelligitur status integer a principio ad finem ejus, n. 3814, ita status totus liberationis, qui per 
`Paesach' in {4}complexu significatur; ex his patet quod per `in decimo mensis hujus' significetur status initiationis interiorum; hic status, nempe initiationis interiorum, erat a die decimo mensis illius 
usque ad diem decimum quartum ejus, intra quos dies pecus paschalis in custodia esset; per `pecudem paschalem' significatur bonum innocentiae, quod intimum est, ita quod intimum hoc cum interioribus 
in quibus est interea secluderetur ac detineretur a talibus quae inquinant; hic status est status initiationis interiorum, hoc est, praeparationis ad recipiendum boni et veri influxum a Domino.  
Hoc sanctum est quod continetur in his verbis, nam absque sancto intus recondito, non mandatum fuisset quod in decimo mensis acciperetur pecus paschalis et custodiretur usque ad diem decimum quartum, 
nec postea quod mactaretur inter vesperas, quodque comederetur assa igne non cocta aquis, quod non de illa aliquid ad mane relinquerent, quod residuum igne comburerent, non frangerent os ejus, et plura 
quae quod involvant sancta quae nemo adhuc novit, quisque scire potest qui expendit; et quod sancta illa sint spiritualia quae Ecclesiae et caeli, quaeque se ad Divinum referunt, a Quo descenderunt
