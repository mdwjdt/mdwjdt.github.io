THE INTERNAL SENSE.      Verses 1-4. And Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. And Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, 
saw her and took her, and lay with her, and forced her. And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spoke upon the heart of the damsel. And Shechem said unto 
Hamor his father, saying, Get me this girl for a woman. "And Dinah went out," signifies the affection of all things of faith, and the church thence derived; "the daughter of Leah, whom she bare unto 
Jacob," signifies in externals; "to see the daughters of the land," signifies to become acquainted with the affections of truth and the churches thence derived; "and Shechem saw her," signifies truth; 
"the son of Hamor the Hivite," signifies from the ancients; "the prince of the land," signifies what is primary among the churches; "and he took her, and lay with her, and forced her," signifies that 
in no other way could this truth be conjoined with the affection of the truth signified by the sons of Jacob her brothers; "and his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob," signifies an inclination 
to conjunction; "and he loved the damsel, and spoke upon her heart," signifies love; "and Shechem said unto Hamor his father," signifies thought from the truth that was among the ancients; "saying, 
Get me this girl for a woman," signifies that it desired to be conjoined with the affection of that truth. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE </p>
<p>Verses 1-4 And Dinah went out, the daughter of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob, to see the daughters of the land. And Shechem saw her, the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the 
land; and he took her, and lay with her, and ravished her. And his soul clung to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young woman and spoke comfortingly to the young woman.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> And Shechem spoke 
to Hamor his father, saying, Get me this girl for a wife. </p>
<p>'Dinah went out' means the affection for all things of faith, and also means the Church arising from that affection. 'The daughter of Leah, 
whom she bore to Jacob' means in things that are external. 'To see the daughters of the land' means to get to know the affections for truth, and the Churches which arise from these. 'And Shechem 
saw her' means truth. 'The son of Hamor the Hivite' means received from the Ancients. 'The prince of the land' means which was first and foremost among the Churches. 'And he took her, and lay with her, 
and ravished her' means that there was no other way in which it could be joined to the affection for truth meant by the sons of Jacob, her brothers. 'And his soul clung to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob' 
means the inclination to be joined to it. 'And he loved the young woman and spoke comfortingly to her' means love. 'And Shechem spoke to Hamor his father' means thought from truth among the Ancients. 
'Saying, Get me this girl for a wife' means that it wished to be joined to the affection for that truth.

SENSUS INTERNUS </p>
<p>Vers. 1-4.  Et exivit Dinah, filia Leae, quam peperit Jacobo, ad videndum filias terrae.  Et vidit illam Shechem filius Hamoris Hivaei, principis terrae, et sumpsit eam, et cubuit 
cum ea, et compressit puellam, et locutus super cor puellae.  Et dixit Shechem ad Hamor patrem suum, dicendo, Accipe mihi natam hanc ad mulierem.  `Exivit Dinah' significat affectionem omnium fidei, 
et Ecclesiam inde: `filia Leae, quam peperit Jacobo' significat in externis: `ad videndum filias terrae' significat ad cognoscendum affectiones veri, et Ecclesias quae sunt inde: `et vidit illam Shechem' 
significat verum: `filius Hamoris Hivaei' significat ab antiquis: `principis terrae' significat primarium inter Ecclesias: </p>
<p>`et sumpsit eam, et cubuit cum ea, et compressit eam' significat quod 
non aliter posset conjungi cum affectione veri per `filios Jacobi fratres ejus' significati: `et adhaerebat anima illius in Dinam, filiam Jacobi' significat propensionem ad conjunctionem: `et amavit 
puellam, et locutus super cor ejus' significat amorem: `et dixit Shechem ad Hamor patrem suum' significat cogitationem ex vero apud antiquos: `dicendo, Accipe mihi natam hanc ad mulierem' significat 
quod conjungi vellet cum affectione illius veri. </p>
