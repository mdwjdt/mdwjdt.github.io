<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1089.</strong>创世记9:24 挪亚醒了酒，知道他小儿子向他所作的事。<br />“挪亚醒了酒”表此时他得到更好的指教。“知道他小儿子向他所作的事”表脱离内在敬拜的外在敬拜就是诸如嘲讽之类的。</p>

And Noah woke up from his wine and realized what his younger son had done to him.<br />Noah woke up from his wine means when they had learned better. And realized what his younger son had done to him means that external worship cut off from internal worship is by nature contemptuous. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1089</b></p><p><b>1089.</b>
Verse 24. And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. "And Noah awoke from his wine" signifies when he was better instructed; "and knew what his younger son had done 
unto him" signifies that external worship separate from internal is such that it derides. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1089</b></p><p><b>1089.</b>
Verse 24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and realized what his younger son had done to him. </p>
<p>'Noah awoke from his wine' means when he was better informed. 'And realized what his younger son had done 
to him' means that external worship separated from internal is such as mocks. </p>

</p><b>1089.</b>
Vers. 24.  Et expergefactus Noah e vino suo, et rescivit quod fecit ei filius ejus minor. 'Expergefactus Noah e vino suo' significat dum melius instructus: 'et rescivit quod fecit ei filius ejus minor' 
significat quod talis sit cultus externus separatus ab interno ut irrideat. </p>
