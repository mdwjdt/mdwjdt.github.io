Verses 20-25. And Jehovah came down upon Mount Sinai, unto the head of the mountain; and Jehovah called Moses unto the head of the mountain; and Moses went up. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go down, charge 
the people, lest perchance they break through unto Jehovah to see, and many of them fall. And the priests also, who come near unto Jehovah shall sanctify themselves, lest perchance Jehovah make 
a breach in them. And Moses said unto Jehovah, The people cannot come up unto Mount Sinai; for Thou didst charge us, saying, Set bounds to the mountain, and sanctify it. And Jehovah said unto him, Go, 
get thee down; and come up thou, and Aaron with thee; and let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto Jehovah, lest perchance He make a breach in them. And Moses went down unto the 
people, and told them. "And Jehovah came down upon Mount Sinai," signifies the presence of the Lord in heaven; "unto the head of the mountain," signifies in the inmost heaven; "and Jehovah called Moses 
unto the head of the mountain, and Moses went up," signifies the conjunction of truth from the Divine there; "and Jehovah said unto Moses," signifies exhortation from the Divine; "Go down, charge 
the people, lest perchance they break through unto Jehovah to see," signifies lest they who are of the spiritual church should desire to ascend into the heaven where the Divine celestial is; "and many 
of them fall," signifies that so they would perish; "and the priests also who come near unto Jehovah shall sanctify themselves," signifies that those who are in spiritual good in which is the Divine 
are to be covered over; "lest perchance Jehovah make a breach in them," signifies consequently separation from good; "and Moses said unto Jehovah," signifies the thought of truth from the Divine; "The 
people cannot come up unto Mount Sinai," signifies that they cannot raise themselves to the celestial kingdom; "for Thou didst charge us," signifies because they have been cautioned by the Divine; "saying, 
Set bounds to the mountain," signifies by the fact that the spiritual sphere of good ceases below; "and sanctify it [the people]," signifies that thus they may be kept off from the Divine; "and 
Jehovah said unto him," signifies further admonition; "Go, get thee down," signifies influx; "and come up thou, and Aaron with thee," signifies conjunction with truth from the Divine internal and external; 
"and let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto Jehovah," signifies lest they who are in spiritual good and truth desire to ascend into the celestial heaven; "lest perchance 
He make a breach in them," signifies separation from truth and good; "and Moses went down unto the people," signifies the influx of the Divine through truth from the Divine; "and told them," signifies 
thus admonition. </p>

Verses 20-25 And Jehovah came down onto Mount Sinai to the top of the mountain; and Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up. And Jehovah said to Moses, Go down, warn the people 
so that they do not perhaps break through to Jehovah to see [Him], and many of them fall. And also the priests coming near Jehovah must sanctify themselves, so that Jehovah does not perhaps make 
a breach in them. And Moses said to Jehovah, The people cannot go up to Mount Sinai; for You have warned us, saying, Set bounds to the mountain and sanctify it. And Jehovah said to him, Go! go down; and 
you are to come up, you and Aaron with you. And do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to Jehovah, so that He does not perhaps make a breach in them. And Moses went down to 
the people and told them. </p>
<p>'And Jehovah came down onto Mount Sinai' means the Lord's presence in heaven. 'To the top of the mountain' means in the inmost. 'And Jehovah called Moses to the top of the 
mountain, and Moses went up' means the joining of the truth from God there. 'And Jehovah said to Moses' means admonition from the Divine. 'Go down, warn the people so that they do not perhaps break through 
to Jehovah to see [Him]' means that those belonging to the spiritual Church should not desire to go up to the heaven where the Divine celestial is. 'And many of them fall' means that in so doing 
they would perish. 'And also the priests coming near Jehovah must sanctify themselves' means that those governed by spiritual good, which has the Divine within it, are to be covered over. 'So that Jehovah 
does not perhaps make a breach in them' means a consequent separation from good. 'And Moses said to Jehovah' means thought engaged in by the truth from God. 'The people cannot go up to Mount Sinai' 
means that they are unable to raise themselves to the celestial kingdom. 'For You have warned us' means because the Divine has cautioned them. 'Saying, You are to set bounds to the mountain' means 
by declaring that the spiritual sphere of good comes to an end below [the celestial kingdom]. 'And sanctify it' means that they are thereby held back from the Divine. 'And Jehovah said to him' means 
further admonition. 'Go! go down' means influx. 'And come up, you and Aaron' means being joined to the truth from God, inward and outward. 'And do not let the priests and the people break through to 
come up to Jehovah' means that those governed by spiritual good and truth should not desire to go up into the celestial heaven. 'So that He does not perhaps make a breach in them' means separation from 
truth and good. 'And Moses went down to the people' means influx of the Divine through the truth from God. 'And told them' means admonition through it. </p>

Vers. 20-25.  Et descendit Jehovah super montem Sinai ad caput montis, et vocavit Jehovah Moschen ad caput montis, et ascendit Moscheh.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Descende, obtestare populum ne forte 
perrumpant ad Jehovam ad videndum, et cadat de eo multus. Et etiam sacerdotes accedentes ad Jehovam sanctificabunt se, ne forte rupturam faciat in illis Jehovah.  Et dixit Moscheh ad Jehovam, Non 
potest populus ascendere ad montem Sinai, quia Tu contestatus es in nos, dicendo, Terminos pone monti, et sanctifica eum.  Et dixit ad illum Jehovah, Abi, descende, et ascendas tu et Aharon tecum, et 
sacerdotes et populus ne perrumpant ad ascendendum ad Jehovam, ne forte rupturam faciat in illis.  Et descendit Moscheh ad populum, et dixit ad illos.  `Et descendit Jehovah super montem Sinai' significat 
praesentiam Domini in caelo: `ad caput montis' significat in intimo: `et vocavit Jehovah Moschen ad caput montis, et ascendit Moscheh' significat conjunctionem veri a Divino ibi: `et dixit Jehovah 
ad Moschen' significat exhortationem a Divino:  `Descende, obtestare populum ne forte perrumpant ad Jehovam ad videndum' significat ne illi qui a spirituali Ecclesia cupiant in caelum ubi Divinum caeleste: 
`et cadat de eo multus' significat quod sic perirent:  `et etiam sacerdotes accedentes ad Jehovam sanctificabunt se' significat illos qui in bono spirituali, in quo Divinum, {1}quod obtegendi: 
`ne forte rupturam faciat in {2}illis Jehovah' significat inde separationem a bono: `et dixit Moscheh ad Jehovam' significat cogitationem veri a Divino: `Non potest populus ascendere ad montem Sinai' 
significat quod ad caeleste regnum nequeant se elevare: `quia Tu contestatus es in nos' significat quia a Divino cautum: `dicendo, Terminos ponas monti' significat per quod sphaera spiritualis boni 
infra desinat: `et sanctifica eum' significat quod sic ex Divino arceantur: `et dixit ad illum Jehovah' significat admonitionem usque:  `Abi, descende' significat influxum: `et ascende tu et Aharon' significat 
conjunctionem cum vero a Divino, interno et externo: `et sacerdotes et populus ne perrumpant ad ascendendum ad Jehovam' significat ne qui in bono et vero spirituali cupiant in caelum caeleste: 
`ne forte rupturam faciat in illis' significat separationem a vero et bono: `et descendit Moscheh ad populum' significat influxum Divini per verum a Divino: `et dixit ad illos' significat sic admonitionem. @1
