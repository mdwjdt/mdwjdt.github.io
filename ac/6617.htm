<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6617节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6617.</strong>一个观念含有无数细节在里面，这一点也从以下事实向我证明：天使仅仅通过听见说话，或检查思维，就能在瞬间察觉一个灵人或一个世人的生命；低层天堂的天使能看到这一切，高层天堂的天使更能看到。一个善灵被提到第一层天堂，从那里与我说话。他说，他看见我那时在圣言中所读到的东西里面有无数事物；然而，关于这个主题，我自己只有一个简单的思维。后来，他被提到一个更内在的天堂，他从那里说，他现在看见更多事物，如此之多，以至于相比之下，他之前所看见的东西在他看来显得很粗俗。接着他又被提到还要更内在的一个天堂，就是属天天使所在的地方，他从那里说，与他现在看见的事物相比，他之前看到的东西几乎可以忽略不计。当这一切持续的时候，各种事物流入进来，我被来自那里的各种事物深深打动。</p>

That there are countless things in one idea, has also been made evident to me from the fact that the angels perceive in a moment the life of a spirit and of a man by merely hearing him speak, or by looking 
into his thought; the angels of a lower heaven can see this, and still more the angels of a higher one. A certain good spirit was taken up into the first heaven, and speaking with me from thence 
he said that he saw infinite things in what I was then reading in the Word; when yet I myself had only a simple thought on the subject. Afterward he was taken up into a more interior heaven, and he 
said from thence that he now saw still more things, and so many that what he had seen before were comparatively gross to him. He was next taken up into a heaven still more interior, where the celestial 
angels are, and he said from thence that what he had before seen was scarcely anything compared with the things he now saw. While this continued, various things flowed in, and I was affected with the 
various things that came from thence. </p>

The fact that one idea holds countless details within itself has also been proved to me by the consideration that angels perceive in an instant the life led by a spirit or a man; they perceive it when 
they merely listen to him speaking or when they examine his thought. This is something the angels of a lower heaven are able to see; and the angels of a higher heaven can see still more. Some good spirit 
was taken up to the first heaven and spoke to me from there. He said that he saw an infinite number of things in what I was reading in the Word at that time; yet to me my thought on the subject 
lacked any such complexity. After this he was taken up to a more internal heaven, from which he said that he now saw still more, so much more that in comparison with it what he had seen previously seemed 
gross to him. After this he was therefore taken up to a yet more internal heaven, where the celestial angels are, and from there he said that what he had seen previously was hardly anything compared 
with what he saw now. While all this lasted, various things flowed in, and the various ones which were from there stirred me with affection. </p>

</p><b>6617.</b>
Quod uni ideae innumerabilia insint, etiam constare mihi potuit ex eo quod angeli momento percipiunt apud spiritum et apud hominem ejus vitam, modo cum audiunt illum loquentem, aut cum inspiciunt cogitationem 
ejus; hoc videre possunt angeli inferioris caeli, et adhuc plura angeli superioris.  Quidam spiritus bonus sublatus est in primum caelum, et inde locutus mecum dicebat quod infinita videret 
in illis quae tunc legebam {1}in Verbo, cum tamen de illa re modo mihi simplex cogitatio esset; postea in interius caelum sublatus est, et inde dicebat quod nunc videret adhuc plura, et tam multa ut 
priora quae viderat ei crassa sint respective; inde dein adhuc interius sublatus est, ubi angeli caelestes, et inde dicebat quod quae prius viderat, vix aliquid essent respective ad illa quae nunc videret; 
cum hoc perstabat, varia influebant, et variis afficiebar quae erant inde. @1 ex$ </p>
