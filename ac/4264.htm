<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4264节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4264.</strong>“奶崽子的骆驼三十只，各带着崽子；母牛四十只，公牛十只，母驴二十匹，驴驹十匹”表服务、一般和特殊的事物。这从“骆驼和它们的崽子”、“母牛和公牛”，以及“母驴和它们的驴驹”的含义清楚可知，它们是指属于属世人的事物。前面数次提到过这些事物，如骆驼（<a href="3048.htm">3048</a>，<a href="3071.htm">3071</a>，<a href="3143.htm">3143</a>，<a href="3145.htm">3145</a>节）、公牛（<a href="1824.htm">1824</a>，<a href="1825.htm">1825</a>，<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>，<a href="2781.htm">2781</a>，<a href="2830.htm">2830</a>节）、母驴（<a href="2781.htm">2781</a>节）。相对于其它事物，属于属世人的这些事物都是用来服务的（参看<a href="1486.htm">1486</a>，<a href="3019.htm">3019</a>，<a href="3020.htm">3020</a>，<a href="3167.htm">3167</a>节）。所以，此处所提到的这些动物表示服务、一般和特殊的事物。至于动物的数量，如母山羊二百只，公山羊二十只，母绵羊二百只，公绵羊二十只，骆驼和它们的崽子三十只，母牛四十只，公牛十只，母驴二十匹，驴驹十匹等，这些都是奥秘，若不详加解释、充分推论，就无法被揭开。因为在圣言中，所有数字都表示真实事物（<a href="482.htm">482</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="575.htm">575</a>，<a href="647.htm">647</a>，<a href="648.htm">648</a>，<a href="755.htm">755</a>，<a href="813.htm">813</a>，<a href="1988.htm">1988</a>，<a href="2075.htm">2075</a>，<a href="2252.htm">2252</a>，<a href="3252.htm">3252</a>节）；至于它们表示什么，这在前几章它们出现的地方已经说明。<br />有时令我感到惊讶的是，天使间的交谈降至灵人界时，会以各种数字来显示；而且，当在圣言中读到数字时，天使将其理解为真实事物。事实上，数字从来不会渗透到天堂，因为数字是空间和时间的度量，这些属于尘世和自然界，与天上的状态及其变化相对应。上古之人是属天的，并与天使交流，他们就知道每个简单数字表示什么，甚至知道复合数字表示什么。这些数字的含义从他们传到他们的后代，以及古教会成员那里。这些都是些令当今教会成员难以置信的事，除了圣言字面上显现的东西外，他们根本不相信圣言里面还蕴藏着更神圣的事物。</p>

Thirty milch camels and their colts, forty heifers and ten bullocks, twenty she-asses and ten foals. That this signifies things of service general and special, is evident from the signification of "camels 
and their colts," and of "heifers and bullocks," also of "she-asses and their foals" as being the things which are of the natural man (concerning which see above - as to camels, n. 3048, 3071, 3143, 
3145; bullocks, n. 1824, 1825, 2180, 2781, 2830; and she-asses, n. 2781). That the things which are of the natural man are relatively things of service, may also be seen above (n. 1486, 3019, 3020, 
3167). Hence it is that by these animals are signified things of service general and special. As regards the number, of she-goats two hundred, of he-goats twenty, of ewes two hundred, of rams twenty, 
of camels and their colts thirty, of heifers forty, of bullocks ten, of she-asses twenty, and of their foals ten, these are arcana which cannot be opened without much explication and ample deduction; 
for all numbers in the Word signify actual things (n. 482, 487, 575, 647, 648, 755, 813, 1988, 2075, 2252, 3252); and what they signify has been shown in the foregoing pages where they have occurred. 
 [2] I have sometimes wondered that when the speech of the angels fell down into the world of spirits, it fell also into various numbers; and also that where numbers were read in the Word, real things 
were understood by the angels. For number never penetrates into heaven, because numbers are measures of both space and of time, these being of the world and of nature, to which in the heavens correspond 
states and changes of states. The most ancient people, who were celestial men and had communication with angels, knew what was signified by every number, even by the compound ones; and from them 
their signification was handed down to their posterity, and to the sons of the Ancient Church. These are things which will hardly be credited by the man of the church at this day, who believes nothing 
to have been stored up in the Word more holy than what appears in the letter. </p>

'Thirty milking camels and their colts; forty young cows and ten young bulls; twenty she-asses and ten foals' means things that are subservient, general and specific. This is clear from the meaning of 
'camels and their colts', also of 'young cows and young bulls' as well as of 'she-asses and their foals' as things which belong to the natural man. These things have been referred to several times already 
- 'camels' in <a href="3048.htm">3048</a>, <a href="3071.htm">3071</a>, <a href="3143.htm">3143</a>, <a href="3145.htm">3145</a>; 'young bulls' in <a href="1824.htm">1824</a>, <a href="1825.htm">1825</a>, <a href="2180.htm">2180</a>, <a href="2781.htm">2781</a>, <a href="2830.htm">2830</a>; 'she-asses' in <a href="2781.htm">2781</a>; and these things which belong to the natural man, in relation to other things are subservient, 
see <a href="1486.htm">1486</a>, <a href="3019.htm">3019</a>, <a href="3020.htm">3020</a>, <a href="3167.htm">3167</a>. Consequently things that are subservient, general and specific, are meant by the animals mentioned here. As regards the numbers of the animals being <a href="200.htm">200</a> she-goats, <a href="20.htm">20</a> he-goats, <a href="200.htm">200</a> sheep, <a href="20.htm">20</a> rams, <a href="30.htm">30</a> camels and their colts, <a href="40.htm">40</a> young cows, <a href="10.htm">10</a> young bulls, <a href="20.htm">20</a> she-asses and <a href="10.htm">10</a> foals, these are arcana which cannot be revealed without much explanation and an extensive 
drawing of inferences. For all numbers used in the Word mean real things, <a href="482.htm">482</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="575.htm">575</a>, <a href="647.htm">647</a>, <a href="648.htm">648</a>, <a href="755.htm">755</a>, <a href="813.htm">813</a>, <a href="1988.htm">1988</a>, <a href="2075.htm">2075</a>, <a href="2252.htm">2252</a>, <a href="3252.htm">3252</a>; and what they mean has been shown where they have occurred in previous 
chapters. </p>

 I have sometimes been amazed that when angels' conversing together came down into the world of spirits their conversation revealed itself in various numbers, and also that when 
numbers have been read in the Word the angels have understood real things. For no numerical value ever penetrates into heaven since numbers belong to measurements both of space and of time, and these 
belong to the world and to the natural order to which, in the heavens, states and changes of states correspond. The most ancient people, who were celestial and had communication with angels, were aware 
of what simple numbers and also compound numbers meant. The meanings of these were conveyed from those people to their descendants and to members of the Ancient Church. These are things which find scarcely 
any acceptance in the member of the Church at the present day who believes that nothing holier is concealed in the Word apart from that which is seen in the letter. </p>

`Camelas lactantes et filios illarum triginta, juvencas quadraginta et juvencos decem, asinas viginti et pullos decem': </p>
<p>quod significet servitia communia et specialia, constat ex significatione `camelarum 
et filiorum (c)illarum,' tum `juvencarum et juvencorum,' ut et `asinarum et pullorum illarum,' quod sint illa quae sunt naturalis hominis, de quibus aliquoties prius, (m)de camelis n. 3048, 
3071, 3143, 3145; de juvencis n. 1824, 1825, 2180, 2780, 2830; de asinabus, n. 2781; quod illa quae sunt naturalis hominis sint respective servitia, videatur n. 1486, 3019, 3020, 3167; inde est 
quod per illa {1} significentur servitia communia et specialia.  Quod attinet numerum caprarum quod ducentae {2}, caprorum quod viginti, ovium quod ducentae, arietum quod viginti, camelarum et filiorum 
earum quod triginta, juvencarum quod quadraginta, juvencorum quod decem, asinarum quod viginti, et pullorum illarum quod decem, sunt arcana quae absque multa explicatione et ampla deductione, 
aperiri nequeunt; omnes enim numeri in Verbo significant res, n. 482, 487, 575, 647, 648, 755, 813, 1988, 2075, 2252, 3252, et quid significant, ostensum est ubi in praecedentibus occurrerunt: [2] 
et quoque miratus (o)sum quandoque quod loquela angelorum cum in mundum spirituum delapsa, etiam in varios numeros ceciderit; tum quod ubi numeri in Verbo lecti sunt, ab angelis intellectae sint res; 
numerus enim nusquam penetrat in caelum, nam numeri sunt mensurae et spatii, tum temporis, et haec sunt mundi et naturae, quibus in caelis correspondent status et statuum mutationes: antiquissimi 
qui caelestes homines fuerunt et communicationem cum angelis habuerunt, noverunt quid per singulos numeros, etiam per compositos significaretur, inde significatio illorum derivata est ad posteros, et 
ad filios Antiquae Ecclesiae: haec sunt quibus homo Ecclesiae (o)hodie, qui nihil sanctius in Verbo credit reconditum esse quam quod in littera apparet, fidem vix adhibeat.      @1 i omnia$
