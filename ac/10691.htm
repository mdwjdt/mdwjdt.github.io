<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10691节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10691</strong>.“摩西不知道在他与耶和华说话的时候，他的面皮发光”表圣言的内在在其外在里面闪耀，而外在却没有发觉。这从“摩西”的代表，以及“不知道”、“发光”、“皮”、“面”和“说话”的含义清楚可知：“摩西”是指包含内在之物的圣言的外在形式（参看<a href="10563.htm">10563</a>，<a href="10571.htm">10571</a>，<a href="10607.htm">10607</a>，<a href="10614.htm">10614</a>节）；“不知道”是指没有发觉；“发光”是指闪耀，因为摩西的面皮发光是来自内在之物的一种闪耀；“皮”是指真理和良善的外在层面（<a href="3540.htm">3540</a>，<a href="5554.htm">5554</a>，<a href="8980.htm">8980</a>节）；“面”是指内层事物（参看<a href="9546.htm">9546</a>节提到的地方），因此，“面皮发光”表示内层事物在外在之物里面的一种闪耀，在此表示在圣言所取的外在形式，也就是圣言字义里面的一种闪耀，因为摩西代表包含内在之物的圣言的外在形式；“说话”是指流注，因为当论及耶和华时，“说话”就表示流注（可参看<a href="2951.htm">2951</a>，<a href="5743.htm">5743</a>，<a href="5797.htm">5797</a>，<a href="7270.htm">7270</a>，<a href="8128.htm">8128</a>，<a href="8660.htm">8660</a>节）。由此明显可知，“摩西不知道在他与耶和华说话的时候，他的面皮发光”表示圣言的内在在其外在里面闪耀，而外在却没有发觉。要知道，圣言的内层在外在之物里面的闪耀是指内在意义在外在意义里面闪耀。因为内在意义不断在外在意义里面闪耀和发光，但只被那些对内在事物拥有情感的人发现。它没有被那些对包含内在之物的外在事物拥有情感的人，也就是那些被称为外在教会成员的人发现。然而，他们不知道的是，这层意义与他们同在，感染他们。那些对圣言、教会和敬拜的内在拥有情感的人究竟是谁，那些对含有内在之物在里面的它们的外在拥有情感的人又是谁，可参看前文（<a href="10683.htm">10683</a>节）。不过，当人们的兴趣在于没有内在的外在，如以色列民族那样时，他们根本无法忍受内在的任何事物，或它在外在里面的光。这解释了为何在接下来的经文中，经上说，他们害怕挨近摩西，当摩西与他们说话时，就用帕子蒙上脸。内在意义之所以闪耀，是因为诸如存在于天堂中的神性真理在那里，从主发出的神性真理向天使显为光，还构成天堂之光（关于这个问题，可参看<a href="9548.htm">9548</a>，<a href="9684.htm">9684</a>节提到的地方）。</p>

That Moses knew not that the skin of his faces shone when he spoke with Him. That this signifies the internal of the Word shining forth in its external without the external perceiving it, is evident 
from the representation of Moses, as being that external of the Word in which is the internal (see n. 10563, 10571, 10607, 10614); from the signification of "knowing not," as being not to perceive; from 
the signification of "shining," as being to shine forth, for the shining of the skin of Moses' faces was from a shining forth from within; from the signification of "the shining," as being what is 
external of truth and of good (n. 3540, 5554, 8980); and from the signification of "the faces," as being the interiors (see at the places cited in n. 9546); thus by the "shining of the skin of the faces" 
is signified the shining forth of the interiors in the external, here in the external of the Word which is the sense of its letter, because by Moses is represented that external of the Word in which 
is the internal; and from the signification of "speaking," as being influx. (That when said of Jehovah "to speak" denotes influx, may be seen in n. 2951, 5743, 5797, 7270, 8128, 8660.) From this it 
is evident that by "Moses knowing not that the skin of his faces shone when he spoke with Him" is signified the internal of the Word shining forth in its external without the external perceiving it. 
Be it known that by the shining forth of the interiors of the Word in the external is meant the internal sense in the external; for the internal sense continually shows itself and shines in the external, 
but is noticed by those only who are in internal things; and it is not perceived by those who are in that external in which is an internal, as are those who are called men of the external church; 
nevertheless, unknown to them, it is present, and affects them. (Who those are that are in the internal of the Word, of the church, and of worship; and who those are that are in the external in which 
is the internal, may be seen above, n. 10683.) But those who are in the external that is devoid of the internal, as was the Israelitish nation, cannot endure anything whatever of the internal, or of its 
light in the external; and therefore it is said of them below that they were afraid to come near unto Moses; and that when Moses spoke with them he put a veil on his faces. The reason why the internal 
sense shines, is that Divine truth is there, such as there is in the heavens, and the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord appears to the angels as light, and moreover, is the light of heaven 
(as may be seen at the places cited in n. 9548, 9684). </p>

'That Moses did not know that the skin of his face gleamed while he talked to Him' means the inward level or aspect of the Word within the outward, shining forth without any perception of it by the outward. 
This is clear from the representation of 'Moses' as the outward form of the Word containing what is inward, dealt with in <a href="10563.htm">10563</a>, <a href="10571.htm">10571</a>, <a href="10607.htm">10607</a>, <a href="10614.htm">10614</a>; from the meaning of 'not knowing' as not perceiving; 
from the meaning of 'gleaming' as shining forth, for the gleaming of the skin of Moses' face is a shining forth from what is inward; from the meaning of 'the skin' as the outward level of truth 
and good, dealt with in <a href="3540.htm">3540</a>, <a href="5554.htm">5554</a>, <a href="8980.htm">8980</a>; from the meaning of 'face' as interior things, dealt with in the places referred to <a href="9546.htm">9546</a>, so that 'the gleaming of the skin of the face' means a shining 
forth of the interior things within what is external or outward, at this point within the outward form the Word takes, which is its literal sense, since Moses represents the outward form of the Word containing 
what is inward; and from the meaning of 'talking' as influx, for 'talking', when it has regard to Jehovah, means influx, see <a href="2951.htm">2951</a>, <a href="5743.htm">5743</a>, <a href="5797.htm">5797</a>, <a href="7270.htm">7270</a>, <a href="8128.htm">8128</a>, <a href="8660.htm">8660</a>. From all this it is evident that 
'Moses did not know that the skin of his face gleamed while he talked to Him' means the inward level of the Word within the outward, shining forth without any perception of it by the outward. It should 
be recognized that by a shining forth of the interiors of the Word within what is outward the internal sense within the external should be understood. The internal sense shines forth unceasingly 
and gleams within the external, yet it is discerned only by those whose affection is for inward things. It is not discerned by those whose affection is for the outward that contains what is inward, that 
is, by those people who are called members of the external Church. Nevertheless that sense is present with them, without their awareness, and exerts an influence on them. Who exactly they are whose 
affection is for the inward level or aspect of the Word, the Church, and worship, and who exactly they are whose affection is for the outward level or aspect of them that has the inward within it, see 
above in <a href="10683.htm">10683</a>. But when people's interest lies in the outward level devoid of the inward, as was so with the Israelite nation, they cannot at all abide the inward level of them or the light from them 
within the outward. This explains why in the verses that follow it says that they were afraid to approach Moses and that when Moses talked to them he put a veil over his face. The reason why the internal 
sense shines forth is that Divine Truth as it exists in the heavens resides in that sense, and Divine Truth emanating from the Lord appears to angels as light and also constitutes the light of 
heaven. For this matter, see in the places referred to in <a href="9548.htm">9548</a>, <a href="9684.htm">9684</a>.  </p>

`Et Moscheh non novit quod coruscaret cutis facierum ejus in loquendo illo cum Ipso':  quod significet internum Verbi in externo ejus elucens absque quod externum percipiat, constat ex repraesentatione 
`Moschis' quod sit externum Verbi, in quo internum:  de qua n. 10563, 10571, 10607, 10614; ex significatione `non nosse' quod sit non percipere; ex significatione `coruscare' quod sit elucere nam 
{1}coruscatio cutis facierum Moschis est {2} ex {3} elucentia ab interno; ex significatione `cutis' quod sit externum veri et boni, de qua n. 3540, 5554, 8980; et ex significatione `facierum' quod sint 
interiora de qua in locis citatis n. 9546; inde per `{4}coruscationem' cutis facierum' significatur elucentia interiorum in externo, hic in externo Verbi, quod est sensus litterae ejus, quia per Moschen 
{5}repraesentatur externum Verbi in quo internum; et ex significatione `loqui' quod sit influxus; quod `loqui' cum de Jehovah, sit influxus, videatur n. 2951, 5743, 5797, 7270, 8128, (a)8660; inde 
patet quod per `Moscheh non novit quod coruscaret cutis facierum ejus in loquendo illo cum Ipso' significetur internum Verbi in externo ejus elucens absque quod externum percipiat.  Sciendum est quod 
per elucentiam interiorum Verbi in externo intelligatur sensus internus in externo; ille sensus {6}continuo elucet et coruscat in hoc, sed non appercipitur ab aliis quam qui in internis sunt; ab illis 
autem qui in externo sunt in quo internum, qui sunt qui externae Ecclesiae homines vocantur, non percipitur, sed usque adest, illis insciis, ac afficit; quinam sunt qui in interno Verbi, Ecclesiae, 
et cultus {7}, et quinam (x)in externo in quo internum, videatur supra n. 10683; at qui in externo sunt absque interno, ut fuit gens Israelitica, prorsus non sustinent internum, seu lucem inde in externo; 
quapropter de illis dicitur infra quod timerent ab accedere ad Moschen, et quod Moscheh quando cum illis loquebatur, dederit super facies suas velamen.  Quod sensus internus luceat, est quia ibi 
est Divinum Verum quale in caelis, et Divinum Verum procedens a Domino apparet angelis ut lux, et quoque est lux caeli, de qua videatur in locis citatis n. 9548, 9684. @1 cum coruscat$ @2 i id$ @3
