<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2886节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2886.</strong>就人的情感和思维而言，情况乃是这样：没有人，无论是谁，无论世人，灵人还是天使，能通过自己意愿和思考，而是通过其他人这样做。这些其他人也无法通过他们自己，而全都再次通过其他人意愿和思考，依此类推。因此，每个个体都通过生命的最初源头，也就是主意愿和思考。凡与在先的源头没有联系的事物都是不存在的。邪恶与虚假与地狱相联，因此，那些沉浸于邪恶与虚假之人的意愿和思维，及其爱、情感和快乐，因而其自由皆来自地狱。而良善与真理与天堂相联，那些具有良善与真理之人的意愿和思维，及其爱、情感和快乐，因而其自由皆来自天堂。由此可见，这种自由源自哪里，那种自由源自哪里。这一事实在来世是众所周知的，但如今却不为世人所知。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2886</b></p><p><b>2886.</b>
As to man's affections and thoughts, the case is this: No one, whoever he may be, whether man, spirit, or angel can will and think from himself; but from others; nor can these others will and think from 
themselves, but all again from others, and so on; and thus each one from the First of life, which is the Lord. That which is unconnected has no existence. Evils and falsities have connection with 
the hells; from the hells come the willing and thinking of those who are in evils and falsities; and also their love, affection, and delight, consequently their freedom. But goods and truths have connection 
with heaven, and the willing and thinking of those who are in them is from heaven, and so also are their love, affection, and delight, and therefore their freedom. From this we may see whence comes 
the one freedom, and whence the other. That the case is really so is most fully known in the other life, but is at this day altogether unknown in the world. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2886</b></p><p><b>2886.</b>
With regard to man's affections and to his thoughts, the position is that no one at all, whether man, spirit, or angel, is able to will or to think from himself, but does so from others. Nor are those 
others themselves the source of anything they will or think, but others again, and so on with these. Thus each individual wills and thinks from the First Source of life, who is the Lord. Anything that 
is not connected to a prior source cannot occur. Evils and falsities have a connection with the hells, and so the hells are the source of the thinking and willing of people immersed in evils and falsities, 
and also the source of their love, affection, and delight, and consequently of their freedom. But goods and truths have a connection with heaven, and so heaven is the source of the thinking and 
willing of people with whom goods and truths are present, and also the source of their love, affection, and delight, and consequently of their freedom. From this it becomes clear where the first type 
of freedom originates and where the second. The truth of this is very well known in the next life, but it is totally unknown at the present time in the world. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2886</b>
</p><b>2886.</b>
Cum homine quoad ejus affectiones et quoad ejus cogitationes, ita se habet:  nullus quicumque sit, sive homo, sive spiritus, sive angelus, potest velle et cogitare a se sed ab aliis, nec hi alii a se, 
sed omnes iterum ab aliis, et sic porro, ita singuli a Primo vitae, Qui est {1}Dominus; quod {2}inconnexum est, non existit; mala et falsa nexum habent cum infernis; inde eorum qui in illis sunt, velle 
et cogitare, et inde eorum amor, affectio et jucundum, proinde eorum liberum; at bona et vera nexum habent cum caelo{3}; inde eorum qui in illis, velle et cogitare, et inde eorum amor, affectio et 
jucundum, proinde eorum liberum:  exinde constare potest unde est liberum unum et liberum alterum:  quod ita se res habeat, notissimum est in altera vita, sed hodie prorsus ignotum in mundo. @1 i in 
omnes est influxus$ @2 i a Primo vitae seu Domino$ @3 i ita cum Domino$ </p>
