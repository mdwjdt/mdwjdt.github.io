<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5044节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5044.</strong>“监狱长”表在试探状态中进行掌管的真理。这从“长”和“监狱”的含义清楚可知：“长”（prince，经上或译首领、君、君王、族长、王子等）是指首要真理，因而是指进行掌管的真理，如下文所述；“监狱”是指虚假的消磨或荒废，因而是指试探，如前所述（<a href="5038.htm">5038</a>，<a href="5039.htm">5039</a>，<a href="5043.htm">5043</a>节）。必须先讨论一下何谓在试探状态下进行掌管的真理。对经历试探的所有人来说，真理从主那里正在流入；这真理掌管并主导他们的思维，每当他们陷入怀疑，甚至感到绝望时，便鼓舞他们。这真理就是那进行掌管的真理，是他们从圣言或教义所学来，并且自己已经确认的那种真理。诚然，在这种时候，其它真理也能被回想起来；但这些真理并不主导内层。有时，进行掌管的真理并未清晰地呈现在理解力面前，而是藏在模糊中；然而，它仍进行掌管。因为主的神性流入这进行掌管的真理，并在如此行的过程中将心智的内层保持在它掌控的范围内；因此，当它出来进入光明时，经历试探的这个人便从它得到安慰，并被它鼓舞。<br />主掌管那些经历试探之人所用的，不是这真理本身，而是对它的情感；因为神性只流入那些属于情感的事物。被植入并扎根于人之内层的真理是通过情感被植入并扎根下来的；没有情感，绝没有任何东西在那里生长。通过情感被植入并扎根下来的真理紧紧依附于心智，并通过对它的情感被回想起来。此外，当这真理被如此回想起来时，它便表现为与它结合的情感；这情感就是此人相应的情感。由于这就是经历试探之人的情形，所以没有人被允许进入任何属灵的试探，除非他已成年，并如此获得能主导他的某种真理。若没有这种真理，他会在试探中倒下；在这种情况下，他末后的景况比先前更不好。从这些事可以看出，“监狱长”所表示的在试探状态下进行掌管的真理是什么意思。<br />“长”（prince，经上或译首领、君、君王、族长、王子等）之所以表示首要真理，是因为“王”在内义上表示真理本身（参看<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="1728.htm">1728</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>，<a href="3009.htm">3009</a>，<a href="3670.htm">3670</a>，<a href="4575.htm">4575</a>，<a href="4581.htm">4581</a>，<a href="4789.htm">4789</a>，<a href="4966.htm">4966</a>节）；因此，“长”（prince，经上或译首领、君、君王、族长、王子等）因是王的主要臣宰，或王的儿子，故表示那真理的首要特征。“长”（prince，经上或译首领、君、君王、族长、王子等）具有这种含义（参看<a href="1482.htm">1482</a>，<a href="2089.htm">2089</a>节）；然而，由于这两段没有从圣言中的许多其它经文说明这层含义，所以此处引用一些经文。以赛亚书：<br />因有一婴孩为我们而生，有一子赐给我们；政权必担在祂的肩头上-和平的君。祂的政权与平安必加增无穷。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.6.htm">9:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.7.htm">7</a>）<br />这论及主。“担在祂肩头上的政权”是指源于祂的天堂里的一切神性真理；因为天堂照着源于良善的真理而被分为各个独立君国，这也解释了为何天使被称为“君”。“平安”表示天堂里蒙福的状态，这种状态从至内层感染良善与真理（<a href="3780.htm">3780</a>节）。这就是为何主被称为“和平的君”，又为何经上说“祂的政权与平安必加增无穷”。<br />同一先知书：<br />琐安的首领，法老大有智慧的谋士极其愚昧。你们怎敢对法老说，我是智慧人的儿子，我是古王的子孙？琐安的首领都变为愚昧，挪弗的首领都受了迷惑；当支派房角石的，使埃及人走错了路。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.11.htm">19:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.13.htm">13</a>）<br />这论及埃及，埃及表示教会的记忆知识（<a href="4749.htm">4749</a>节），因而表示属世真理，也就是次序的最末和最低层。由于同样的原因，埃及在此被称为“支派房角石”，因为“支派”是指整体上真理的各个方面或一切事物（<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="3862.htm">3862</a>，<a href="3926.htm">3926</a>，<a href="3939.htm">3939</a>，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>节）。但在这段经文中，“埃及”是指败坏教会真理的记忆知识，因而是指被歪曲的处于次序最低层的真理，这真理由“琐安的首领”和“挪弗的首领”来表示。他之所以自称“是古王的子孙”，是因为埃及的记忆知识来自古教会的真理。“王”表示真理本身，如前所示；“古王”表示古教会的真理。<br /><br />亚述却不这样思想；他心里并不这样打算；他心里倒想毁灭、剪除不少的民族。因为他说，我的首领不都是君王吗？（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.7.htm">10:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.8.htm">8</a>）<br />“亚述”表示推理神性真理，虚假由此产生，因而表示败坏的推理（<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>节）。“他说，我的首领不都是君王吗”表示被如此歪曲的真理，也就是通过推理产生，并看上去完全就像的真理的虚假。只要人的心智专注于历史的字义，他就无法看出，因而相信“亚述”表示推理，他那 “为君王的首领”表示被视为至高真理的首要虚假。他若不肯接受这种观念：神性的圣言里面有比字义上所看到的更神圣、更普遍的某种东西，则更不相信这一点。然而，就内义而言，在圣言中，“亚述”无非表示理性和推理，“王”表示真理本身，“首领”表示真理的首要特征。天堂里的人对亚述一无所知，天使也将对王和首领的观念从自己那里抹去；当在人里面察觉到它时，他们便将它转向主，并理解为从主发出并属于天堂里的主之物，即从祂的神性良善发出的神性真理。<br /><br />亚述人必倒在剑下，并非人的；有剑，并非人的，要将他吞灭；他的磐石必因惊吓挪去，他的首领必因大旗惊惶。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛31.8.htm">31:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛31.9.htm">9</a>）<br />这也论及埃及，埃及表示被败坏的教会的记忆知识。“亚述”表示基于记忆知识对于神性真理的推理，这推理导致败坏和歪曲；“首领”表示这些被败坏和歪曲的真理；让亚述倒下的“剑”是指与真理进行争战并毁灭真理的虚假（<a href="2799.htm">2799</a>，<a href="4499.htm">4499</a>节）。<br />法老的力量必作你们的羞辱；投在埃及的荫下，要为你们的惭愧，他们的首领已在琐安。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.3.htm">30:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.4.htm">4</a>）<br />“琐安的首领”表示被歪曲的真理，因而表示歪曲，如前所述。<br /><br />鹈鹕、箭猪却要占据它；猫头鹰、乌鸦要住在其间；祂必将空虚的准绳、混沌的线铊拉在其上。让他们召它那里没有一国的贵胄，它的所有首领也都归于无有。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛34.11.htm">34:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛34.12.htm">12</a>）<br />“鹈鹕”、“箭猪”、“猫头鹰”和“乌鸦”表示当圣言中的神性真理被视为一文不值时所产生的虚假的不同种类；“空虚的准绳和混沌的线铊”表示真理的荒凉和荒废；“首领”表示虚假，对于此处所描述的人来说，它们就是首要真理。又<br />我要辱没圣所的首领，使雅各成为咒诅，使以色列成为辱骂。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛43.28.htm">43:28</a>）<br />“辱没圣所的首领”表示亵渎神圣真理；“使雅各成为咒诅，使以色列成为辱骂”表示外在和内在教会的真理的毁灭；“雅各”是指外在教会，“以色列”是指内在教会（参看<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>节）。<br />耶利米书：<br />那时就有坐大卫宝座的君王和首领，他们与他们的首领，或坐车，或骑马进入这城的各门。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶17.25.htm">17:25</a>）<br />凡根据历史意义理解此处圣言的人不可能知道有比以下观念更深层、更神圣的东西隐藏在这些话里面，即：君王和首领或坐车，或骑马通过城门进入，他由此总结出所指的是这国的持续时间。但人若知道“城”、“君王”、“首领”、“大卫的宝座”、“坐车”、“骑马”在内义上分别表示什么，就会看出这段描述含有更深层、更神圣的东西；因为“城”或耶路撒冷表示主的属灵国度（<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="3654.htm">3654</a>节）；“君王”表示神性真理，如前所示；“首领”表示真理的首要特征；“大卫的宝座”表示主的天堂（<a href="1888.htm">1888</a>节）；“坐车和骑马”表示教会的属灵理解（<a href="2760.htm">2760</a>，<a href="2761.htm">2761</a>，<a href="3217.htm">3217</a>节）。<br /><br />有剑临到迦勒底人和巴比伦的居民并她的首领与智慧人。有剑临到说谎的人。有剑临到她的马匹、车辆。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.35.htm">50:35</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.37.htm">37</a>）<br />“剑”表示与虚假争战的真理，并与真理争战并荒废它的虚假（<a href="2799.htm">2799</a>，<a href="4499.htm">4499</a>节）；“迦勒底人”表示那些亵渎真理的人；“巴比伦的居民”表示那些亵渎良善的人（<a href="1182.htm">1182</a>，<a href="1283.htm">1283</a>，<a href="1295.htm">1295</a>，<a href="1304.htm">1304</a>，<a href="1307.htm">1307</a>，<a href="1308.htm">1308</a>，<a href="1321.htm">1321</a>，<a href="1322.htm">1322</a>，<a href="1326.htm">1326</a>，<a href="1327.htm">1327</a>e节）；“首领”表示虚假，对这种人来说，这些虚假是首要的真理；“马匹”表示教会所拥有的理解，“车辆”表示教会的教义，“有剑临到马匹、车辆”表示对这些的荒废。<br /><br />主何竟发怒，使云遮蔽锡安城！主吞灭雅各一切的住处，并不顾惜；祂发怒拆毁犹大女子的保障，使这保障坍倒在地；祂辱没这国和其中的首领；锡安的门，都陷入地内，祂将门闩毁坏折断。君王和首领落在列族中。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.1.htm">2:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.9.htm">9</a>）<br />“锡安和犹大的女子”表示属天教会，在此是指这被毁的教会；“国”表示其中的教义真理（<a href="2547.htm">2547</a>，<a href="4691.htm">4691</a>节）；“君王”表示真理本身，“首领”表示这真理的首要特征。<br /><br />因饥饿爆发，我们的皮肤就黑如炉。他们在锡安玷污妇人，在犹大的城邑玷污处女，他们吊起首领的手。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀5.10.htm">5:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀5.12.htm">12</a>）<br />“首领的手被吊起”表示真理遭到亵渎，因为“吊起”代表亵渎的诅咒；由于这种代表，当这百姓随从巴力毗珥犯奸淫，并拜他们的神时，耶和华吩咐将族长对着日头悬挂（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民25.1.htm">25:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民25.4.htm">4</a>）；因为随从随从巴力毗珥犯奸淫，并拜他们的神就是亵渎神圣。以西结书：<br />君王要悲哀，官长要披凄凉为衣，那地人民的手都发颤；我必照他们的行径待他们。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结7.27.htm">7:27</a>）<br />此处“王”同样表示总体上的真理，“官长”表示它的首要特征。<br /><br />他们中间的君必在天黑的时候将物件搭在肩头上带出去。他们要挖通了墙，从其中带出去。他必蒙住脸，眼看不见地。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结12.12.htm">12:12</a>）<br />显而易见，“君”在此并非表示一个君，而表示教会的真理；当论及这真理，经上说它“必在天黑的时候将物件搭在肩头上”时，意思是说，尽全力在虚假当中传下真理，因为“黑暗”表示虚假；“蒙住脸”表示根本看不见真理；他“眼看不见地”表示丝毫看不见教会的东西；“地”表示教会（参看<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>，<a href="1068.htm">1068</a>，<a href="1262.htm">1262</a>，<a href="1413.htm">1413</a>，<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>e，<a href="2928.htm">2928</a>，<a href="3355.htm">3355</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="4535.htm">4535</a>节）。何西阿书：<br />以色列人也必坐多日，无君王、无首领、无祭祀、无柱像、无以弗得、无家中的神像。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何3.4.htm">3:4</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />王女在里面极其荣华，她的衣服是用金线绣的。她要穿锦绣的衣服，被引到王前；你的子孙要接续你的列祖，你要立他们在全地作王子。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗45.13.htm">45:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗45.16.htm">16</a>）<br />“王女”表示主的属灵国度，它凭主的神性真理而被称为祂的属灵国度，在此被描述为“她的衣服是用金线绣的”和“锦绣的衣服”；“子孙”是指源于主的神性的那国的真理，这些真理必作“王子”，也就是首要真理或真理的首要特征。以西结书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/结44.3.htm">44:3</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结45.7.htm">45:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结45.8.htm">8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结45.17.htm">17</a>；<a

href="http://39-27.cn/结46.18.htm">18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结48.21.htm">48:21</a>）所描述的“君王”（prince）（即他和他在新耶路撒冷和新地的地业）表示总体上源于主之神性的真理；因为那里的“新耶路撒冷”、“新殿”和“新地”表示主在天上和地上的国度；在以西结书，这国通过诸如在圣言其它部分所见到的那类代表来描述。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5044</b></p><p><b>5044.</b>
And the prince of the prison house. That this signifies truth governing in a state of temptations, is evident from the signification of a "prince," as being primary truth, thus the governing truth, of 
which presently; and from the signification of a "prison house" as being the vastation of falsity, and consequently temptation (of which above, n. 5038, 5039, 5043). What is meant by truth governing 
in a state of temptations must first be told. With all who are in temptations there flows in truth from the Lord, which rules and governs the thoughts and raises up the sufferers whenever they fall into 
doubts and even into despair. This governing truth is that truth and such truth as they have learned from the Word or from doctrine, and have confirmed in themselves. Other truths are indeed at such 
times also called to mind, but they do not govern the interiors. Sometimes the truth which governs is not presented visibly before the understanding, but lies hid in obscurity, yet it still governs; 
for the Divine of the Lord flows into it, and thus keeps the interiors of the mind in it, and therefore when it comes into light, the person who is in temptation receives consolation and is relieved. 
 [2] It is not this truth itself, but the affection of it, by which the Lord governs those who are in temptations; for the Divine flows only into those things which are of the affection. The truth 
which is implanted and rooted in a man's interiors is implanted and rooted by affection, and not at all without affection; and the truth which has been implanted and rooted by affection, clings there, 
and is recalled by affection; and when this truth is so recalled, it presents the affection that is conjoined with it, which is the man's reciprocal affection. As such is the case with the man who is 
in temptations, therefore no one is admitted into any spiritual temptation until he reaches adult age, and has thus become imbued with some truth by which he can be governed; otherwise he sinks under 
the temptation, and then his latter state is worse than the first. From these things it may be seen what is meant by truth governing in a state of temptations, which is signified by the "prince of the 
prison house." [3] That a "prince" denotes primary truth, is because a "king" in the internal sense signifies truth itself (see n. 1672, 1728, 2015, 2069, 3009, 3670, 4575, 4581, 4789, 4966); hence 
"princes," because they are the sons of a king, signify the primary things of that truth. That "princes" have this signification may be seen above in n. 1482 and 2089, but as this was not there proved 
from many other passages in the Word, some may be cited here. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>	Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given; and the principality shall be upon His shoulder-the Prince of peace. Of the 
multiplying of His principality and peace there shall be no end (Isa. 9:6-7); </p>
<p>which is said of the Lord. The "principality upon the shoulder" is all Divine truth in the heavens from Him; for the heavens 
are distinguished into principalities according to truths from good, whence also the angels are called "principalities." Peace is a state of blessedness in the heavens, affecting with good and truth 
from the inmosts (n. 3780); hence the Lord is called the "Prince of peace," and it is said that "of the multiplying of His principality and peace there shall be no end." [4] Again in the same prophet: </p>
<p>	The 
princes of Zoan are foolish, the wise, the counselors of Pharaoh. How say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of the kings of antiquity? The princes of Zoan are become fools, 
the princes of Noph are deceived; and they have seduced Egypt, the corner stone of the tribes (Isa. 19:11, 13); </p>
<p>treating of Egypt, by which is signified the memory-knowledge of the church (n. 4749), 
thus natural truth, which is the ultimate of order; wherefore also Egypt is here called the "corner stone of the tribes," for the "tribes" are all things of truth in one complex (n. 3858, 3862, 3926, 
3939, 4060). But in this passage "Egypt" is the memory-knowledge which perverts the truths of the church, thus truths in the ultimate of order falsified, which are the "princes of Zoan" and the "princes 
of Noph." He calls himself the "son of the kings of antiquity," because the memory-knowledges in Egypt were from the truths of the Ancient Church. The truths themselves are signified by "kings," 
as was shown above, and the truths of the Ancient Church are signified by the "kings of antiquity." [5] Again: </p>
<p>	Asshur thinketh not right, and his heart doth not meditate right; for his heart is to 
destroy, and to cut off nations not a few. For he saith, Are not my princes kings? (Isa. 10:7-8); </p>
<p>"Asshur" denotes reasoning about Divine truths, from which come falsities, thus perverse reasoning (n. 
1186). The truths thus falsified, or falsities, which are produced by reasoning and which appear as the veriest truths, are signified by his saying, "Are not my princes kings?" That "Asshur" is reasoning, 
and that his "princes who are kings" are primary falsities which are believed to be the veriest truths, cannot be seen and thence believed so long as the mind is kept in the historic sense of 
the letter, and still less if it is in the negative as to there being anything more holy and more universal in the Divine Word than what appears in the letter; and yet in the internal sense by "Asshur" 
nothing else than reason and reasoning is understood in the Word, and by "kings" truths themselves, and by "princes" the primary things of truth. Nothing is known in heaven of Asshur, and the angels 
also reject from themselves the idea of a king and a prince; and when they perceive it in man, they transfer it to the Lord, and perceive that which proceeds from the Lord and is the Lord's in heaven, 
namely, the Divine truth from His Divine good.  [6] Again: </p>
<p>	Asshur shall fall with the sword, not of a man; and the sword, not of a man, shall devour him; his rock shall also pass away by reason of 
dread, but his princes shall be dismayed by the ensign (Isa. 31:8-9); </p>
<p>also said of Egypt, which is the memory-knowledge of the church perverted. Reasoning from memory-knowledges about Divine truths, 
from which come perversion and falsification, is "Asshur," these truths perverted and falsified are the "princes," the "sword with which Asshur shall fall" is falsity battling with and vastating truth 
(n. 2799, 4499). Again: </p>
<p>	The strength of Pharaoh shall become to you for a shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt for a reproach, when his princes shall be in Zoan (Isa. 30:3-4); </p>
<p>the "princes 
in Zoan" denote truths falsified, thus falsities, as above. [7] Again: </p>
<p>	The pelican and the bittern shall possess it; and the owl and the raven shall dwell therein; he shall stretch over it the line 
of emptiness, and the plummet of a waste. The nobles thereof are not there, they shall call a kingdom, and all her princes shall be nothing (Isa. 34:11-12); </p>
<p>the "pelican," the "bittern," the "owl," 
and the "raven," denote the different kinds of falsity which come into existence when the Divine truths that are in the Word become of no account. The desolation and vastation of truth are signified 
by the "line of emptiness, and the plummet of a waste;" and the falsities, which to them are primary truths, are signified by "princes." Again: </p>
<p>	I will render profane the princes of holiness, and I 
will give Jacob for a curse, and Israel for reproaches (Isa. 43:28); </p>
<p>"to profane the princes of holiness" denotes to profane holy truths; the extirpation of the truth of the external and the internal 
church is signified by "giving Jacob for a curse, and Israel for reproaches"; that "Jacob" is the external church, and "Israel" the internal, may be seen above (n. 4286). [8] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>	There shall 
enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariot and on horses, they and their princes (Jer. 17:25); </p>
<p>one who here understands the Word in the 
historic sense, cannot be aware that the words store within them anything more deep and holy than that kings and princes would enter in by the gates of the city in chariots and on horses, and he gathers 
from it that the duration of the kingdom is referred to; but he who knows what a "city," "kings," "princes," the "throne of David," and "riding in chariot and on horses" signify in the internal 
sense, sees there things more deep and holy; for the "city" or Jerusalem signifies the spiritual kingdom of the Lord (n. 2117, 3654); "kings" signify Divine truths (as shown above); "princes," the primary 
things of truth; the "throne of David," the heaven of the Lord (n. 1888); "riding in chariot and on horses," the spiritual understanding of the church (n. 2760, 2761, 3217). [9] Again: </p>
<p>	O sword 
against the Chaldeans, and against the inhabitants of Babylon, and against her princes and against her wise men. O sword against the liars. O sword against her horses and against her chariots (Jer. 50:35-37); </p>
<p>a 
"sword" denotes truth fighting against falsity, and falsity fighting against truth and vastating it (n. 2799, 4499); the "Chaldeans" denote those who profane truths; and the "inhabitants 
of Babylon," those who profane good (n. 1182, 1283, 1295, 1304, 1307, 1308, 1321, 1322, 1326, 1327e); "princes" denote the falsities which to such are primary truths; "horses," the intellectual of the 
church, and "chariots," its doctrine, the vastation of which is signified by a "sword against the horses and against the chariots." [10] Again: </p>
<p>	How doth the Lord in His anger cloud over the daughter 
of Zion! The Lord hath swallowed up, He hath not spared, all the habitations of Jacob; He hath destroyed in His wrath the stronghold of the daughter of Judah; He hath cast them forth to the earth; 
He hath profaned the kingdom and the princes thereof; the gates have sunk into the earth, and He hath broken the bars in pieces; the king and the princes are among the nations (Lam. 2:1-2, 9); </p>
<p>the "daughter 
of Zion and of Judah" denotes the celestial church, here this church destroyed; the "kingdom," the truths of doctrine therein (n. 2547, 4691); the "king," the truth itself, and the "princes," 
its primaries. [11] Again: </p>
<p>	Our skins have been blackened like an oven, because of the storms of famine. They ravished the women in Zion, the virgins in the cities of Judah, the princes were hanged 
up by their hand (Lam. 5:10-12); </p>
<p>"the princes being hanged up by their hand" denotes that truths are profaned, for hanging represented the damnation of profanation; and because of this representation, 
it was also commanded when the people committed whoredom after Baalpeor and worshiped their gods, that the princes should be hanged up before the sun (Num. 25:1-4); for to commit whoredom after Baalpeor, 
and to worship their gods, was to profane worship. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>	The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with astonishment, and the hands of the people of the land shall be terrified; 
I will deal with them after their way (Ezek. 7:27); </p>
<p>where the "king" in like manner denotes truth in general, and the "prince," its primaries. [12] Again: </p>
<p>	The prince that is in the midst of them 
shall be borne upon the shoulder in the dark, and shall go forth; they shall dig through the wall to bring out through it; he will veil over his faces that he see not the earth at his eye (Ezek. 12:12); </p>
<p>that 
a "prince" here does not mean a prince, but the truth of the church, is very manifest; and when it is said of this that it shall be "borne on the shoulder in the dark," it means that with 
all their might it should be conveyed down among falsities, for "darkness" is falsities; "to veil over the faces" denotes that truth should not be seen at all; his "not seeing the earth at his eye," means 
that nothing of the church would be seen. (That the "earth" is the church may be seen above, n. 662, 1066, 1068, 1262, 1413, 1607, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118e, 2928, 3355, 4447, 4535.) In Hosea: </p>
<p>	The 
sons of Israel shall sit many days, there is no king, and no prince, and no sacrifice, and no pillar, and no ephod, and no teraphim (Hos. 3:4). [13] And in David: </p>
<p>	The king's daughter is all glorious 
within; and of inweavings of gold is her garment, in needlework shall she be brought to the king; instead of thy fathers shall be thy sons, thou shalt set them for princes in the whole earth (Ps. 
45:13-16); </p>
<p>the "king's daughter" is the Lord's spiritual kingdom, which is called His spiritual kingdom from the Lord's Divine truth, here described by her garment of inweavings of gold and of needlework; 
"sons" are the truths of that kingdom which are from the Lord's Divine, which must be "princes," that is, primary truths. The "prince" who together with his possessions in the New Jerusalem and 
in the new earth is described in Ezekiel (44:3; 45:7, 8, 17; 46:8, 10, 12, 16, 18; 48:21) signifies in general the truth which is from the Lord's Divine; for by the "New Jerusalem," the "new temple," 
and the "new earth" there, is meant the Lord's kingdom in heaven and on earth, which is there described by representatives such as are found in other parts of the Word. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5044</b></p><p><b>5044.</b>
'And the governor of the prison-house gave' means the truth governing in a state of temptations. This is clear from the meaning of 'the governor (or the prince)' as the primary and so governing truth, 
dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'the prison-house' as the laying waste of falsity, and therefore temptation, dealt with above in <a href="5038.htm">5038</a>, <a href="5039.htm">5039</a>, <a href="5043.htm">5043</a>. What the truth governing in a state of temptations 
is must first be discussed. With all who are undergoing temptations truth from the Lord is flowing in, and this truth rules and governs their thoughts, uplifting them every time they are given 
to doubt and also to feelings of despair. This truth is what that governing truth is, and it is the kind of truth which they have learned from the Word and from doctrine and which they themselves have 
confirmed. Other kinds of truth may also be called on at such times, but these do not govern those persons interiorly. Sometimes the truth governing them does not make itself clearly visible in their 
understanding but lies obscured, yet continues to govern. For the Lord's Divine flows into that governing truth and in so doing keeps the interior parts of the mind within its domain, so that when 
it comes out into the light the person undergoing temptation receives comfort from it and is uplifted by it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Not the actual truth but an affection for it is what the Lord uses to govern those 
undergoing temptations; for the Divine does not flow into anything except that which is regarded with affection. Truth that has been implanted and become rooted in a person interiorly has been implanted 
and become rooted there through affection. Absolutely nothing grows there without affection. Truth that has been implanted and become rooted through affection sticks in the mind, and it is recollected 
through an affection for it. Furthermore when that truth is recollected it also manifests the affection attached to it, an affection which in that person is a reciprocal one. This being what goes 
on in a person who undergoes temptations, no one is therefore allowed to experience any spiritual temptation until he reaches adult years and so has acquired some truth by means of which he may be governed. 
Without that truth he goes under, in which case his latter state is worse than his former one. From all this one may see what is implied by the truth governing in a state of temptations, meant 
by 'the governor of the prison-house'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The reason 'a prince (or a governor)' means a primary truth is that 'a king' in the internal sense means the truth itself, <a href="1672.htm">1672</a>, <a href="1728.htm">1728</a>, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="2069.htm">2069</a>, <a href="3009.htm">3009</a>, <a href="3670.htm">3670</a>, <a href="4575.htm">4575</a>, <a href="4581.htm">4581</a>, <a href="4789.htm">4789</a>, <a href="4966.htm">4966</a>, and consequently because 'princes' are the king's chief subjects the primary features of that truth are meant by them. For this meaning of 'princes', see <a href="1482.htm">1482</a>, <a href="2089.htm">2089</a>; yet because 
those two paragraphs have not shown that meaning from other places in the Word, let some be introduced here: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
To us a boy is born, to us a son is given, on whose shoulder will be the 
government<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> - the prince of peace, increasing government<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> and peace [to which] there will be no end. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%209:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 9:6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord. 'The government upon his shoulder' means all Divine Truth 
in the heavens originating in Him, for the heavens are distinguished into separate principalities in keeping with the varieties of truth derived from good, which also explains why angels are called 
principalities. 'Peace' means the state of bliss in the heavens which inmostly affects what is good and true, <a href="3780.htm">3780</a>. This is why the Lord is called 'the prince of peace' and why it speaks of Him 'increasing 
government and peace to which there will be no end'. </p>

<p>This refers to 
Egypt, by which the Church's factual knowledge is meant, <a href="4749.htm">4749</a>, and so natural truth, which is the last and lowest degree of order. For the same reason Egypt is here called 'the corner-stone of the tribes',

Here however 'Egypt' is factual knowledge that perverts the truths known to the Church, and 
so is truths in the lowest degree of order that have been falsified, meant by 'the princes of Zoan and the princes of Noph'. The reason Egypt calls itself 'a son of the kings of old' is that the factual 
knowledge which existed in that land had its origin in the truths known to the Ancient Church. Actual truths are meant by 'kings', as shown above, and the truths known to the Ancient Church by 'the

</blockquote>
<p>'Asshur' stands for reasoning about Divine truths which gives rise to falsities, and so stands for perverted reason, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>. Truths falsified in this way, 
that is, falsities, which are the product of reasoning and look altogether like truths, are meant when Asshur says 'Are not my princes kings?' As long as a person's mind is fixed on the historical sense 
of the letter he cannot see or consequently believe that 'Asshur' means reasoning, and that 'princes who are kings' means major falsities which are regarded as supreme truths. Still less can he believe 
this if he refuses to entertain the idea that there is something holier and more universal within the Divine Word than that which is seen in the literal sense. Yet in the internal sense 'Asshur' 
is used to mean in the Word nothing else than reason and reasoning, and 'kings' to mean actual truths, 'princes' the primary features of truth. Also, those in heaven have no knowledge as to what or 
who 'Asshur' may be, besides which angels put away from themselves the idea of a king or a prince; and when they detect this idea residing with man they transfer it to the Lord and then perceive that 
which goes forth from the Lord and which is the Lord's in heaven, namely His Divine Truth going forth from His Divine Good.  </p>

<p>This too refers to Egypt, by which 
the Church's factual knowledge once it has been perverted is meant. Reasoning based on known facts regarding Divine truths which leads to perversion and falsification is meant by 'Asshur', those perverted

<p>'The spoon-bill', 'the duck',

<p>'Rendering the princes of holiness profane' refers to holy truths. The annihilation of

 Quia ita cum homine qui in tentationibus est, se habet, ideo nullus in tentationem aliquam spiritualem admittitur priusquam in adulta aetate est et imbuerat ita aliquod verum per quod gubernari 
queat; si non id, succumbit, et tunc status ejus posterior fit pejor priore.  Ex his constare potest quid intelligitur per verum gubernans in statu tentationum, quod significatur per `principem domus 
carceris'.  [3] Quod `princeps' sit primarium verum, est quia `rex' in sensu interno significat ipsum verum, n. 1672, 1728, 2015, 2069, 3009, 3670, 4575, 4581, 4789, 4966; inde `principes' quia 
sunt regis, significant primaria illius veri; quod principes illa significent, videatur n. 1482, 2089; sed quia ibi ex aliis locis in Verbo non ita ostensum est, licet hic aliqua afferre; apud Esaiam, </p>

         Puer natus est nobis, filius datus est nobis, super      cujus humero principatus:... princeps pacis, multiplicans      {3} principatum, et pacem, non erit finis, ix 5, 6 [A.V.    
  6, 7]; </p>
<p>                                ibi de Domino; `principatus super humero' est omne Divinum Verum in caelis ab Ipso, caeli enim distincti sunt in principatus secundum vera ex bono, inde quoque 
angeli vocantur principatus; </p>
<p>`pax'est status beatitudinis in caelis afficiens bonum et verum ab intimis, n. 3780, inde Dominus vocatur `princeps pacis' et dicitur `multiplicans principatum et 
pacem, quibus non finis': [4] apud eundem, </p>
<p>          Stulti sunt principes Zoanis, sapientes, consiliarii      Pharaonis:... quomodo dicitis ad Pharaonem, Filius      sapientum ego, filius regum 
antiquitatis?... infatuati      principes Zoanis, decepti principes Noph; et seduxerunt      Aegyptum angularem lapidem tribuum, xix 11, 13; </p>
<p> ibi de Aegypto, per quam significatur scientificum Ecclesiae, 
n. 4749, ita verum naturale quod ultimum ordinis est, quare etiam Aegyptus hic vocatur `angularis lapis tribuum'; `tribus' enim sunt omnia veri in uno complexu, n. 3858, 3862, 3926, 3939, 
4060; hic autem `Aegyptus' est scientificum quod pervertit vera Ecclesiae, ita vera in ultimo ordinis falsificata, quae sunt `principes Zoanis et principes Noph'; quod dicat se `filium regum antiquitatis' 
est quia scientifica ibi fuerunt ex veris Antiquae Ecclesiae; ipsa vera significantur per `reges', ut supra ostensum, et vera Ecclesiae Antiquae per `reges antiquitatis': [5] apud eundem, </p>
<p> 
         Asshur non rectum cogitat, et cor illius non rectum      meditatur, nam ad perdendum cor ejus, et ad exscindendum      gentes non paucas, nam dicit, Nonne principes mei sunt      reges? 
x 7, 8; </p>
<p> `Asshur' pro ratiocinatione de veris Divinis, unde falsitates, ita pro ratione perversa, n. 1186; vera inde falsificata seu falsa, quae per ratiocinationem fiunt et apparent (o)sicut ipsissima 
vera, significantur per quod dicat `nonne principes mei sunt reges?'; </p>
<p>quod `Asshur' sit ratiocinatio, et quod `principes qui {4} reges', sint primaria falsa quae creduntur esse ipsissima vera, 
non videri potest et inde {5} credi quamdiu mens in sensu litterae historico tenetur, et adhuc minus si in negativo est quod sanctius quid et universalius Verbo Divino insit, quam quod in littera 
apparet; cum tamen in sensu interno per `Asshurem' nihil aliud quam ratio (c)et ratiocinatio in Verbo intelligitur, et per `reges' ipsa vera, perque `principes' primaria veri; ignoratur etiam in 
caelo quid Asshur, et quoque angeli (t)a se rejiciunt ideam regis et principis, et cum appercipiunt illam apud hominem, transferunt illam ad Dominum, et percipiunt id quod procedit a Domino et quod est 
Domini in caelo, nempe Divinum Verum a Divino Bono Ipsius: [6] apud eundem, </p>
<p>          Cadit Asshur gladio non viri, et gladius non hominis      comedet illum,... etiam petra ejus prae formidine  
    transibit, et consternabuntur a vexillo principes ejus,      xxxi, 8, 9; </p>
<p> ibi etiam de Aegypto, quae est scientificum (o)Ecclesiae perversum; </p>
<p>ratiocinatio a scientificis de veris Divinis 
unde perversio et falsificatio, est `Asshur'; vera illa perversa et falsificata sunt `principes'; (m)`gladius quo (o)Asshur cadet' est falsum pugnans et vastans verum, n. 2799, </p>
<p>          Fiet 
vobis robur Pharaonis in pudorem et fiducia in      umbra Aegypti in ignominiam, cum fuerint in Zoan      principes ejus, xxx 3, 4; </p>
<p> [7] `in Zoan principes' pro veris falsificatis, ita pro falsis, 
ut supra: apud eundem, </p>
<p>          Possidebunt eam platea et anataria, ac noctua et      corvus habitabunt in ea; extendet super eam lineam      inanitatis et per habitabunt nobiles ejus non ibi, 
regnum      vocent, et perpendicula vastitatis; nobilis ejus non ibi,      regnum vocent, et omnes principes ejus erunt nihil, xxxiv      11, 12; </p>
<p> `platea, anataria, noctua, corvus' pro generibus 
falsi quae existunt cum vera Divina quae in Verbo, nihili fiunt; desolatio et vastatio veri significatur per `lineam inanitatis et perpendicula vastitatis', et falsa quae illis primaria vera, per 
principes': </p>
<p>apud eundem, </p>
<p>          Profanos reddam principes sanctitatis, et dabo in      devotionem Jacobum, et Israelem in opprobria, xliii 28; </p>
<p> `profanos reddere principes sanctitatis' pro 
sancta vera; </p>
<p>exstirpatio veri Ecclesiae externae et internae significatur per `dare in devotionem Jacobum, et Israelem in opprobria'; quod `Jacob' sit Ecclesia externa et `Israel' interna, videatur 
n. 4286: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam, </p>
<p>          Intrabunt per portas civitatis hujus reges et      principes sedentes super throno Davidis, equitantes in      curru et super equis, ipsi et principes illorum, 
xvii 25; </p>
<p> qui Verbum in, sensu historico hic intelligit, is non scire potest quod aliquid altius et sanctius in his reconditum sit quam quod reges et principes intrabunt per portas civitatis in 
curru et super equis, et colligit inde quod significetur regni duratio, sed qui novit quid in sensu interno significat civitas, quid reges, quid principes, quid thronus Davidis, et quid equitare in 
curru et super equis, is videt altiora et sanctiora ibi; `civitas' enim seu Hierosolyma significat regnum Domini spirituale, n. 2117, 3654; `reges' Divina Vera, ut supra ostensum; </p>
<p>`principes' primaria 
veri, `thronus Davidis' caelum Domini, n. 1888, `equitare in curru et super equis' intellectuale spirituale Ecclesiae, n. 2760, 2761, {6} 3217: [9] apud eundem, </p>
<p>          Gladie contra Chaldaeos,... 
et contra habitatores      Babelis, et contra principes ejus, et contra sapientes      ejus; gladie contra mendaces,... gladie contra equos      ejus, et contra currus ejus, l 35-37; </p>
<p> `gladius' 
pro vero pugnante contra falsum, et pro falso pugnante contra verum et id vastante, n. 2799, 4499; `Chaldaei' pro illis qui profanant vera {7}, et `habitatores Babelis' qui profanant bonum, 
n. 1182, 1283, 1295, 1304, {8} 1307, 1308, 1321, 1322, 1326, 1327 f; `principes' pro falsis quae illis primaria vera; `equi' pro intellectuali Ecclesiae, `currus' pro doctrinali ejus, quorum vastatio 
significatur per `gladium contra equos et contra currus': </p>
<p>[10] apud eundem, </p>
<p>          Quomodo obnubilat in ira Sua Dominus filiam Zionis,      absorpsit Dominus, non pepercit omnibus habitaculis  
    Jacobi, destruxit in excandescentia Sua munimenta filiae      Jehudae, projecit in terram, profanavit regnum et      principes ejus;... subsederunt iri terram portae {9}, et      confregit 
vectes {9}, rex et principes {9} inter gentes,      Thren. ii 1, 2, 9; </p>
<p> `filia Zionis et {10} Jehudae' pro Ecclesia caelesti, hic pro illa destructa; `regnum' pro veris doctrinae ibi, n. 2547, 
4691; `rex' pro ipso vero, `principes' pro primariis ejus: [11] apud eundem, </p>
<p>          Cutes nostrae sicut clibanus denigratae sunt propter      procellas famis, mulieres in Zione compresserunt,  
    virgines in urbibus Jehudae, principes manu eorum      suspensi sunt, Thren. v 10-12; </p>
<p> `principes manu eorum suspensi' pro quod vera profanata, suspensio enim repraesentabat damnationem profanationis; 
et quia suspensio illam {11} repraesentabat, etiam mandatum (o)est </p>
<p>          Cum populus scortatus post Baalpeorem et adorarent      deos eorum, ut principes suspenderentur ante solem, 
Num.      xxv 1-3, [4]; </p>
<p> `scortari enim post Baalpeorem et adorare deos eorum' erat profanare cultum: apud Ezechielem </p>
<p>          Rex lugebit, et princeps induetur stupore, et manus      populi 
terrae perterrebuntur, ex via (c)illorum agam cum      illis, vii 27; </p>
<p> `rex' similiter pro vero in genere, et `princeps' pro primariis ejus: [12] apud eundem, </p>
<p>          Princeps qui in medio eorum 
super humero portabitur      sub tenebras et exibit, parietem perfodient ad educendum      per eum, facies ejus obvelabit ut non videat ad oculum      ille terram, xii 12; </p>
<p> quod `princeps' hic 
non sit princeps, manifeste patet, sed quod `sit' verum Ecclesiae, de quo cum dicitur quod `super humero portabitur sub tenebras', est quod omni potentia deferatur {12} inter falsa, `tenebrae' enim 
sunt falsa; `facies obvelare' est quod verum prorsus non videatur; ut `non videat ad oculum terram' est quod nihil Ecclesiae; quod `terra' sit Ecclesia, videatur n. 662, 1066, 1067, 1262, 1413, 
1607, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118 f, 2928, 3355, 4447, 4535: apud Hosheam, </p>
<p>          Dies multos sedebunt filii Israelis, non rex et non      princeps, et non sacrificium, et non statua, et non     
 ephodus, et non teraphim, iii 4: </p>
<p> [13] et apud Davidem, </p>
<p>          Tota gloriosa filia regis intus, et de implexis auri      vestis ejus, in acupictis adducetur regi, loco patrum      tuorum erunt 
filii tui, pones eos in principes in      universa terra, Ps. xlv 14, 15, 17 [A. V. 13, 14, 16]; </p>
<p> `filia regis' est regnum Domini spirituale; regnum Ipsius spirituale dicitur a vero Divino Domini, 
quod ibi {13} describitur per `vestem ex implexis auri et ex acupictis'; `filii' sunt vera illius regni quae a Divino Domini, quae `principes,' hoc est, primaria erunt.  Per `principem', de quo 
et de cujus possessione in Nova Hierosolyma et in nova terra agitur apud Ezechielem xlv 3; xiv 7, 8, 17; xlvi 8, 10, 12, 16, 18; xlviii 21, significatur in genere verum quod a Divino Domini; per 
`Novam enim Hierosolymam' ibi, et per `Novum Templum', et per novam terram' intelligitur regnum Domini in caelis et in terris, quod (o)ibi per repraesentativa qualia alibi in Verbo, describitur. </p>
