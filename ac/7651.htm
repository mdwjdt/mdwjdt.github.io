<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7651.</strong>出埃及记10:7-11.法老的臣仆对他说，这事为我们的网罗要到几时呢？打发这些人去，让他们事奉耶和华他们的神吧！埃及已经败坏了，你还不知道吗？于是摩西、亚伦被召回到法老那里；法老对他们说，你们去事奉耶和华你们的神，但谁和谁要去呢？摩西说，我们要和我们的孩子、我们的老人、儿子女儿同去，且把羊群牛群一同带去，因为这是耶和华为我们设的节期。法老对他们说，我容你们和你们的小孩子去的时候，耶和华与你们同在吧！看，灾祸就在你们面前。不可都去，你们这壮年人去事奉耶和华吧！因为这是你们所求的。于是，把他们从法老面前撵出去。<br />“法老的臣仆对他说”表来自那些陷入恐惧之人的一个警告。“这事为我们的网罗要到几时呢”表这样他们将被自己的邪恶所掳。“打发这些人去，让他们事奉耶和华他们的神吧”表建议离开他们，好叫他们敬拜主他们的神。“埃及已经败坏了，你还不知道吗”表从所发生的事就能知道凡给那些简单人制造麻烦的人都被丢进地狱，地狱是无处可逃的。“于是摩西、亚伦被召回到法老那里”表结果，神之真理的出现。“法老对他们说”表一种意向。“你们去事奉耶和华你们的神”表要离开他们，好叫他们敬拜主。“但谁和谁要去呢”表是否还有人留下来。“摩西说”表回答。“我们要和我们的孩子、我们的老人同去”表简单人和智慧人。“儿子女儿”表那些对真理拥有一种情感的人和那些对良善拥有一种情感的人。“且把羊群牛群一同带去”表那些处于内层良善的人和那些处于外层良善的人。“因为这是耶和华为我们设的节期”表每一个人对主的敬拜。“法老对他们说”表嘲笑。“我容你们和你们的小孩子去的时候，耶和华与你们同在吧”表要是离开他们，好像主就会与他们同在。“看，灾祸就在你们面前”表他们所渴望的东西里面没有良善。“不可都去”表拒绝。“你们这壮年人去事奉耶和华吧”表要离开那些处于确证真理的人，好叫他们敬拜主。“因为这是你们所求的”表这样他们就拥有自己想要的东西。“于是，把他们从法老面前撵出去”表侵扰者的意愿与神的真理完全对立。</p>

Verses 7-11. And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, and let them serve Jehovah their God; knowest thou not yet that Egypt is perishing? And Moses 
and Aaron were brought back unto Pharaoh; and he said unto them, Go ye, serve Jehovah your God; who and who are going? And Moses said, We will go with our boys, and with our old men; with our sons 
and with our daughters, with our flock and with our herd, will we go, because we have a feast of Jehovah. And he said unto them, So shall Jehovah be with you when I let you go, and your babe; see ye 
that evil is before your faces. Not so; go I pray, ye that are young men, and serve Jehovah; because this ye seek. And he drove them out from the faces of Pharaoh. "And Pharaoh's servants said unto him," 
signifies a warning from those who are in fear; "How long shall this man be a snare to us?" signifies that thus they would be caught by their own evil; "let the men go, and let them serve Jehovah 
their God," signifies that it would be prudent to leave them, so that they may worship the Lord their God; "knowest thou not yet that Egypt is perishing?" signifies that from what has happened it can 
be known that all who harass those simple ones are cast down into hell, whence there is no escape; "and Moses and Aaron were brought back unto Pharaoh," signifies the presence of truth Divine in consequence; 
"and he said unto them," signifies inclination; "Go ye, serve Jehovah your God," signifies that they shall be left, so that they may worship the Lord; "who and who are going?" signifies whether 
any would remain; "and Moses said," signifies the answer; "We will go with our boys, and with our old men," signifies the simple and the wise; "with our sons and with our daughters," signifies those 
who are in the affection of truth, and those who are in the affection of good; "with our flock and with our herd will we go," signifies those who are in interior good, and those who are in exterior good; 
"because we have a feast of Jehovah," signifies the worship of the Lord by all and each; "and he said unto them," signifies derision; "So shall Jehovah be with you when I let you go, and your babe," 
signifies as if the Lord would be with them if they were left; "see ye that evil is before your faces," signifies that in the desire there is no good; "not so," signifies denial; "go I pray, ye that 
are young men, and serve Jehovah," signifies that they who are in confirmed truths shall be left so that they may worship the Lord; "because this ye seek," signifies that thus they have what they wish; 
"and he drove them out from the faces of Pharaoh," signifies that the will of the infesters was quite contrary to truth Divine. </p>

Verses 7-11 And Pharaoh's servants said to him, How long will this thing be a snare to us? Send the men away, and let them serve Jehovah their God. Do you not yet know that Egypt is perishing? And Moses 
and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh, and he said to them, Go, serve Jehovah your God. But just who will be going?<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> And Moses said, We shall go with our children and with our old people; with our 
sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds we shall go; for it is a feast of Jehovah for us. And he said to them, So Jehovah will be with you when I send you and your little children 
away! See that evil is on your faces. Not so! Go now, you young men, and serve Jehovah; for this is what you seek. And he drove them out from Pharaoh's face.  </p>
<p>'And Pharaoh's servants said to 
him' means a warning from those subject to fear. 'How long will this thing be a snare to us?' means that by behaving in that way they would be held captive by their own evil. 'Send the men away, and let 
them serve Jehovah their God' means that it is advisable to leave them, in order that they may worship the Lord their God. 'Do you not yet know that Egypt is perishing?' means that the things which 
have taken place go to show that all who give those simple people trouble are cast into hell, from where there is no escape. 'And Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh' means the presence of God's 
truth as a result. 'And he said to them' means a readiness. 'Go, serve Jehovah your God' means that they will be left alone in order that they may worship the Lord. 'But just who will be going?' 
means Would not some be remaining? 'And Moses said' means the reply. 'We shall go with our children and with our old people' means the simple and the wise. 'With our sons and with our daughters' means 
those who have an affection for truth and those who have an affection for good. 'With our flocks and with our herds we shall go' means those governed by good, interior and exterior. 'For it is a feast 
of Jehovah for us' means worship of the Lord offered by every single one. 'And he said to them' means mockery. 'So Jehovah will be with you when I send you and your little children away!' means As though 
the Lord would be with them if they were left alone! 'See that evil is on your faces' means that no good resides in what they desire. 'Not so!' means a refusal. 'Go now, you young men, and serve 
Jehovah' means that those guided by truths that have been corroborated will be left alone, in order that they may worship the Lord. 'For this is what you seek' means that then they have what they desire. 
'And he drove them out from Pharaoh's face' means that the will of the molesters was totally opposed to God's truth.

Vers. 7-11.  Et dixerunt servi Pharaonis ad illum, Quousque erit hoc nobis ad laqueum? dimitte viros, et serviant Jehovae Deo illorum; an nondum scis quod pereat Aegyptus?  Et reductus Moscheh et Aharon 
ad Pharaonem, et dixit ad illos, Ite, servite Jehovae Deo vestro; quis et quis eunt?  Et dixit Moscheh, Cum pueris nostris et cum senibus nostris ibimus, cum filiis nostris et cum filiabus nostris, 
cum grege nostro et cum armento nostro ibimus, quia festum Jehovae nobis.  Et dixit ad illos, Erit sic Jehovah cum vobis, quando dimisero vos et infantem vestrum; videte quod malum apud facies vestras. 
 Non ita, ite quaeso juvenes, et servite Jehovae, quia hoc vos quaeritis; et expulit illos ex faciebus Pharaonis.  `Et dixerunt servi Pharaonis ad illum' significat admonitionem ab illis qui in timore 
{1}: `Quousque erit hoc nobis ad laqueum?' significat quod sic caperentur a malo suo: `dimitte viros, et serviant Jehovae Deo illorum' significat quod consultum sit relinquere illos ut colant Dominum 
Deum suum: `an nondum scis quod pereat Aegyptus?' significat (m)quod ex factis sciri possit quod omnes qui simplices illos lacessunt dejiciantur in infernum, unde nulla evasio:(n) `et reductus Moscheh 
et Aharon ad Pharaonem' significat praesentiam veri Divini inde: `et dixit ad illos' significat inclinationem: `Ite, servite Jehovae Deo vestro' significat quod relinquentur ut colant Dominum: 
`quis et quis eunt?' significat num remanerent aliqui: `et dixit Moscheh' significat responsum: `Cum pueris nostris et cum senibus nostris ibimus' significat simplices et sapientes: `cum filiis nostris 
et cum filiabus nostris' significat qui in affectione veri et (d)in affectione boni: cum grege nostro et cum armento nostro ibimus' significat qui in bono interiore et exteriore: `quia festum Jehovae 
nobis' significat cultum Domini omnibus et singulis: `et dixit ad illos' significat subsannationem: `Erit sic Jehovah cum vobis, quando dimisero vos et infantem vestrum' significat sicut Dominus apud 
illos foret si relinquantur: `videte quod malum apud facies vestras' significat in desiderio non bonum: `non ita' significat negationem: `ite quaeso juvenes, et servite Jehovae' significat quod relinquentur 
qui in veris (x)confirmatis, ut colant Dominum: `quia hoc vos quaeritis' significat quod sic habeant quod volunt: `et expulit illos ex faciebus Pharaonis' significat quod voluntas infestantium 
prorsus contrariaretur vero Divino. 	@1 i sunt$ </p>
