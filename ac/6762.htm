<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6762节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6762.</strong>“把他藏在沙土里”表他把它赶到虚假所在的地方。这从“藏”和“沙”的含义清楚可知：“藏”是指驱赶；“沙”是指真正的记忆知识，在反面意义上是指虚假的记忆知识。“沙”之所以具有这种含义，是因为沙子所形成的“石头”具有这两种含义（参看<a href="1298.htm">1298</a>，<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>，<a href="3769.htm">3769</a>，<a href="3771.htm">3771</a>，<a href="3773.htm">3773</a>，<a href="3789.htm">3789</a>，<a href="3798.htm">3798</a>，<a href="6426.htm">6426</a>节）。在摩西五经，“沙”也表示真理：<br />西布伦和以萨迦要将万民召到山上，在那里献公义的祭，因为他们要吸取海里的丰富，并沙中所藏的秘密珍宝。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.18.htm">33:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.19.htm">19</a>）<br />“将万民召到山上”表示使真理变成良善，或使信变成仁；因为“（人）民”表示信之真理，“山”表示仁之良善；“献公义的祭”表示源于仁爱的敬拜；“吸取海里的丰富”表示富有真正的记忆知识；“沙中所藏的秘密珍宝”表示藏在真正记忆知识里面的奥秘。“沙”因表示真正的记忆知识，故也在反面意义上表示虚假的记忆知识；因为在圣言中，大多数事物也具有反面意义，从正面意义就能知道这反面意义是什么。至于此处的解释，即“把他藏在沙土里”所表示的赶到虚假当中，情况是这样：当深陷虚假的地狱灵在灵人界，在那里试图毁灭存在于那些经历试探之人中间的真理时，他们在沦落地狱之后，就再也出不来了。众多经历使我知道这一点。这就是赶到虚假当中的含义。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6762</b></p><p><b>6762.</b>
And hid him in the sand. That this signifies that he banished it to where falsities are, is evident from the signification of "hiding," as being to banish; and from the signification of "sand," as being 
true memory-knowledge, and in the opposite sense false memory-knowledge. That "sand" has this signification, is because "stone," from which is sand, signifies both (see n. 1298, 3720, 3769, 3771, 
3773, 3789, 3798, 6426). Truth is also signified by "sand" in Moses: </p>
<p>     Zebulun and Issachar shall call the peoples into the mountain, and shall sacrifice sacrifices of righteousness; for they shall 
suck the affluence of the sea, and the hidden things of the secrets of the sand (Deut. 33:18-19); </p>
<p>"to call the peoples into the mountain" denotes to cause truths to become goods, or faith charity; 
for "peoples" denote the truths of faith, and "mountain" the good of charity; "to sacrifice the sacrifices of righteousness" denotes worship from charity; "to suck the affluence of the sea" denotes to 
abound in true memory-knowledges; "the hidden things of the secrets of the sand" denote the arcana of true memory-knowledges. And as the "sand" signifies true memory-knowledge, it also signifies in the 
opposite sense false memory-knowledge; for most things in the Word have also an opposite sense, and what the opposite sense is, is known from the genuine sense. As regards this removal among falsities, 
which is signified by "he hid him in the sand," the case is this. When infernal spirits who are in falsities have been in the world of spirits, and have there attempted to destroy truths with those 
who are in temptation, they are afterward banished into the hells, whence they can no longer go out. This it has been given me to know by many experiences. Such is the signification of banishment among 
falsities. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6762</b></p><p><b>6762.</b>
'And hid him in the sand' means that he banished it to where falsities were. This is clear from the meaning of 'hiding' as banishing; and from the meaning of 'the sand' as true factual knowledge, or 
in the contrary sense false factual knowledge. The reason why these are meant by 'the sand' is that 'stone', from which the sand is formed, has both those meanings, <a href="1298.htm">1298</a>, <a href="7720.htm">7720</a>, <a href="3769.htm">3769</a>, <a href="3771.htm">3771</a>, <a href="3773.htm">3773</a>, <a href="3789.htm">3789</a>, <a href="3798.htm">3798</a>, <a href="6426.htm">6426</a>. Truth is meant by 'the sand' in Moses, Zebulun and Issachar will call peoples to the mountain; there they will offer sacrifices of righteousness, because they will suck the plentifulness 
of the sea, and the hidden treasures of the secrets of the sand. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2033:18,%2019&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 33:18, 19</a>. </p>
<p>'Calling peoples to the mountain' stands for acting so that truths may become forms of good, or faith become charity; 
for 'peoples' are the truths of faith, and 'the mountain' is the good of charity. 'Offering sacrifices of righteousness' stands for worship that springs from charity, 'sucking the plentifulness of 
the sea' for abounding in true factual knowledge, and 'the hidden treasures of the secrets of the sand' for the arcana concealed within true factual knowledge. Now since 'the sand' means true factual 
knowledge, it also means in the contrary sense false factual knowledge; for the majority of things in the Word also have a contrary meaning, and what that contrary meaning is like may be recognized from 
the genuine one. With regard to the explanation here, a banishment among falsities - which are meant by 'he hid him in the sand' - the situation is this: When hellish spirits who are steeped in falsities 
have been in the world of spirits, trying to destroy the truths present with those undergoing temptation, they are after that relegated to hells from which they cannot ever again come out. Very 
many experiences have allowed me to know of this. An operation such as this is what is meant by a relegation to a place among falsities. </p>

`Et abscondidit illum in arena': quod significet quod ablegaverit ubi falsa, constat a significatione `abscondere' quod sit ablegare; et a significatione `arenae' quod sit scientificum verum, et in 
opposito sensu scientificum falsum; quod `arena' id sit, est quia `lapis,' ex quo arena est, significat utrumque, {1} n. 1298, 3720, 3769, 3771, 3773, 3789, 3798, 6426; verum etiam per `arenam' significatur 
apud Mosen, Sebulon et Jisaschar populos in montem vocabunt, {2}ibi sacrificabunt sacrificia justitiae, quia affluentiam maris sugent, et obtecta occultorum arenae, Deut. xxxiii 18, 19; </p>
<p>`populos 
in montem vocare' pro facere ut vera fiant bona, seu fides charitas, `populi' enim sunt vera fidei, `mons' bonum charitatis; `sacrificare sacrificia justitiae' pro cultu ex charitate; `affluentiam 
maris sugere' pro abundare veris scientificis; `obtecta occultorum arenae' pro scientificorum verorum arcanis; et quia `arena' significat scientificum verum, etiam in opposito sensu significat scientificum 
falsum, nam pleraque in Verbo etiam oppositum sensum habent, et qualis {3}est sensus oppositus, cognoscitur ex genuino.  Cum hoc quod ablegaverit inter falsa quae significantur per `abscondidit 
illum in arena' ita se habet: spiritus infernales qui in falsis sunt, cum in mundo spirituum fuerunt et ibi destruere conati sunt vera apud illos qui in tentatione sunt, relegantur dein in inferna unde 
amplius exire nequeunt; hoc per {4}experientias plures mihi scire datum est; tale est quod significatur per relegationem inter falsa {5}. 	@1 i videatur$ 	@2 et I$ 	@3 sit$ 	@4 vivas experientias$ 	@5
