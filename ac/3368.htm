<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3368节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3368.</strong>“你不要下埃及去，要住在我所指示你的地”表不要求助于记忆知识，而要求助于理性事物，它们被神性启示后而成为真理的表象。这从“埃及”和“地”的含义清楚可知：“埃及”是指记忆知识（<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>-<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>，<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>节）；“地”在此是指被神性启示后而成为真理的表象的理性事物。事实上，此处的“地”是指“基拉耳”，就是非利士人的王亚比米勒所在之地，而“基拉耳”表信；“亚比米勒”表关注理性事物的信之教义；“非利士人的王”表教义事物（<a href="3363.htm">3363</a>，<a href="3365.htm">3365</a>节）。因此，“地”，也就是亚比米勒所在的基拉耳在内义上没有其它含义。<br />因为“地”或“陆地”有各种含义（<a href="620.htm">620</a>，<a href="636.htm">636</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>节），它表示它所论及之地的民族的品性（<a href="1262.htm">1262</a>节）。但严格来说，“地”或“陆地”表教会（<a href="3355.htm">3355</a>节）；并且它因表教会，故也表属于教会的事物，就是构成人里面的教会之物，由此表示仁与信的教义事物，从而也表示被神性启示后而成为真理的表象的理性事物；因为这些表象是教会的真理，因而是其教义事物（参看<a href="3364.htm">3364</a>，<a href="3365.htm">3365</a>节）。无论你说被神性启示的理性事物，还是说真理的表象，或诸如存在于主在天上的国度，或天堂，以及诸如存在于主在地上的国度，或教会中的那类属天和属灵的真理，都是一回事。这些事物也被称为教义事物，不过，这是因为它们里面所含有的真理。天使和人类的理性因被神性所启示的真理表象而存在并被称为理性。没有这些表象，理性就不存在，因此理性事物就是这些真理表象。<br />经上之所以在此说“不要下埃及去”，就是不要求助于记忆知识，原因在于，记忆知识早就论述过了，因为亚伯拉罕寄居在埃及就代表主童年时在记忆知识方面所接受的教导（参看<a href="1502.htm">1502</a>节）。至于这个奥秘，就是不要下埃及去，而要寄居在基拉耳地，也就是说，不要求助于记忆知识，而要求助于理性，情况是这样：含有神性在里面的一切真理表象属于理性，以致理性真理和真理表象是一回事；而记忆知识属于属世人，以致属世真理和记忆真理是一回事。若不通过神性进入理性，并经由理性事物进入属于属世人的记忆知识的流注，理性真理或真理的表象绝不可能存在和显现。那时，在理性中所产生的事物就显现在属世人中，就像许多事物的形像一起显现在一面镜中那样。这就是它们呈现给世人，以及天使的方式；然而，对天使来说，理性事物在属世人中呈现得不像在那些身处灵人界和属灵-属世区域的人身上那样明显，因此，这些人拥有真理的代表。<br />每个人的情况也是这样，因为如前所述，处于良善的人就是一个小天堂，或也可说，就是大天堂的一个形像。由于神圣真理无法直接流入属于属世人的记忆知识，只能经由理性事物流入，如前所述，故经上在此说以撒不要下埃及去，而要住在基拉耳地。不过，若不知道流注的性质，以及观念的性质，就不可能对这些事有清晰的概念；故蒙主的神圣怜悯，这些事会在各章末尾讲述记事的地方予以论述。</p>

Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land of which I tell thee. That this signifies that He should not go down to memory-knowledges, but to rational things which being enlightened by the Divine are appearances 
of truth, is evident from the signification of "Egypt," as being memory-knowledge (n. 1164-1165, 1186, 1462); and from the signification of "land," as being here rational things which when 
enlightened by the Divine are appearances of truth; for the land which is here meant is Gerar, where Abimelech king of the Philistines was, and by "Gerar" is signified faith; by "Abimelech," the doctrine 
of faith that looks to rational things; and by the "king of the Philistines," doctrinal things (n. 3363, 3365); so that the "land," namely, Gerar where Abimelech was, has the above signification in 
the internal sense.  [2] For the signification of "land" is various (n. 620, 636, 1066), denoting the quality of the nation of which it is predicated (n. 1262). But in the proper sense "land" signifies 
the church (n. 3355); and because it signifies the church, it signifies also those things which are of the church, consequently the doctrinal things of charity and faith; thus also rational things 
which being enlightened by the Divine are appearances of truth; for that these appearances are the truths of the church, thus its doctrinal things, may be seen above (n. 3364, 3365). Whether you say 
rational things enlightened by the Divine, or appearances of truth, or celestial and spiritual truths such as are in the Lord's kingdom in the heavens, or in heaven, and such as are in His kingdom on 
the earths, or in the church, comes to the same thing; and the same are also called doctrinal things, but this from the truths that are in them. The angelic and human rational is and is called rational 
from appearances of truth that are enlightened by the Divine, and without these it is not rational; thus rational things are these appearances of truth. [3] The reason why it is here said that He 
should not go down into Egypt, that is, not to memory-knowledges, is that memory-knowledges have already been treated of; for Abraham's sojourning in Egypt represented the Lord's instruction in His childhood 
in memory-knowledges (n. 1502). As regards the arcanum that He should not go down into Egypt, but should sojourn in the land of Gerar, that is, that He should not look to memory-knowledges, but 
to rational things, the case is this: All appearances of truth that have what is Divine in them belong to the rational, insomuch that rational truths and appearances of truth are the same; whereas memory-knowledges 
belong to the natural, insomuch that natural truths and memory-truths are the same. Rational truths, or appearances of truth, cannot possibly be and come forth except from the influx 
of the Divine into the rational, and through rational things into the memory-knowledges which are of the natural. The things which then take place in the rational appear in the natural; just as an image 
of many things appears all together in a mirror; and thereby they are presented before the man, and also before an angel; before an angel however they are not presented so evidently in the natural 
as they are with those who are in the world of spirits and are in the spiritual natural, and hence these have representatives of truth.  [4] The case is similar with every man, for as before said the 
man who is in good is a little heaven, or what is the same is an image of the Grand Heaven; and because Divine truth cannot inflow immediately into memory-knowledges, which are of the natural man, but 
only through rational things, as before said, therefore it is here said that Isaac should not go down into Egypt, but should reside in the land of Gerar. But a clear idea cannot be had concerning these 
things unless the nature of influx is known, and also the nature of ideas; and therefore of the Lord's Divine mercy these things will be treated of at the close of the chapters, where experiences 
are related. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3368</b></p><p><b>3368.</b>
'Do not go down to Egypt; dwell in the land of which I tell you' means not resorting to facts but to rational concepts which, when enlightened from the Divine, are appearances of truth. This is clear 
from the meaning of 'Egypt' as facts, dealt with in <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>, <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>, and from the meaning of 'the land' here as rational concepts which, when enlightened from the Divine, are appearances of truth. 
'The land' meant here is in fact Gerar, where Abimelech the king of the Philistines was, and 'Gerar' means faith, 'Abimelech' the doctrine of faith that has regard to rational concepts, and 'the 
king of the Philistines' matters of doctrine, see <a href="3364.htm">3364</a>, <a href="3365.htm">3365</a>. 'The land' therefore, that is to say, Gerar where Abimelech was, has no other meaning in the internal sense. For 'the land' or 'the earth' 
varies in meaning, see <a href="620.htm">620</a>, <a href="636.htm">636</a>, <a href="1066.htm">1066</a>, since it means the character of the nation whose land it is said to be, <a href="1262.htm">1262</a>, though in the proper sense it means the Church, <a href="3355.htm">3355</a>; and as it means the Church it 
also means the things that belong to the Church, that is, the things which with anyone constitute the Church. Consequently it means the matters of doctrine concerning charity and faith, and so also 
the rational concepts which, when enlightened from the Divine, are appearances of truth; for these appearances are the truths of the Church, and so its matters of doctrine, see above in <a href="3364.htm">3364</a>, <a href="3365.htm">3365</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
Whether you speak of rational concepts enlightened from the Divine, or of appearances of truth, or of celestial and spiritual truths as these exist in the Lord's kingdom in the heavens, or in heaven, 
and as they exist in the Lord's kingdom on earth, or in the Church, it amounts to the same. The same are also called matters of doctrine, but this is so because of the truths they hold within them. 
The rational, both in angels and in men, has its being and is called rational from appearances of truth that have been enlightened from the Divine. Devoid of those appearances the rational has no existence, 
so that rational concepts are appearances. The reason it is said here that he was not to go down to Egypt, that is, not to resort to facts, is that facts have been dealt with already, in that 
Abraham's sojourning in Egypt represented the Lord's instruction in facts during childhood; see <a href="1502.htm">1502</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The implications of the arcanum that he was not to go down into Egypt but was to sojourn 
in the land of Gerar, that is, He was not to have regard to facts but to rational concepts, are that all appearances of truth that hold the Divine within them belong to the rational, so much so that rational 
truths and appearances of truth are one and the same, whereas facts belong to the natural, so much so that natural truths and factual truths are one and the same. Rational truths, or appearances 
of the truth, cannot possibly exist or manifest themselves except from an influx of the Divine into the rational, and by way of rational concepts into the facts that belong to the natural. That which 
is produced at that time in the rational is seen in the natural as an image produced by many objects reflected simultaneously in a mirror. This is how they present themselves to men and to angels also, 
though with angels the presentation of rational concepts in the natural is not very manifest, as it is with those in the world of spirits and the spiritual-natural realm, who therefore have representatives 
of truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 It is similar with men, with every one, for as stated already anyone who is governed by good is a miniature heaven, or what amounts to the same, an image of heaven as a whole. 
And because Divine Truth is unable to flow directly into the facts that are present in the natural man, but only - as has been stated - by way of rational concepts it is therefore said here, Do not 
go down to Egypt, but dwell in the land of Gerar. But as no clear idea of these matters is possible unless one knows the nature of influx, and also the nature of ideas, therefore they are in the Lord's 
Divine mercy to be dealt with at the ends of chapters, where experiences to do with influx will be described. </p>

`Ne descendas Aegyptum, reside in terra quam dico ad te': quod significet quod non ad scientifica, sed ad rationalia, quae a Divino illustrata sunt apparentiae veri, constat a significatione `Aegypti' 
quod sint scientifica, de qua n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462; et a significatione `terrae' quod hic sint rationalia quae a Divino illustrata sunt apparentiae veri, terra enim quae hic intelligitur, est 
Gerar ubi Abimelech rex Philistaeorum, et per `Gerarem' significatur fides, perque `Abimelechum' doctrina fidei spectans rationalia, et per `regem Philistaeorum' doctrinalia, videatur n. 3364, 3365; ideo 
per `terram,' nempe Gerarem ubi Abimelechus, non aliud in sensu interno significatur; significatio enim terrae est varia, videatur n. 620, 636, (x)1066, et significat quale gentis de qua praedicatur 
n. 1262; in proprio autem sensu significat Ecclesiam, n. 3355, et quia Ecclesiam, etiam significat illa quae sunt Ecclesiae, hoc est, illa quae apud hominem faciunt Ecclesiam, proinde doctrinalia charitatis 
et fidei, ita quoque rationalia quae a Divino illustrata sunt apparentiae veri; hae enim quod sint Ecclesiae vera, ita ejus doctrinalia, videatur supra n. 3364, 3365; [2] sive dicas rationalia 
a Divino illustrata, sive apparentias veri, sive vera caelestia et spiritualia, qualia in regno Domini in Caelis seu in caelo, et qualia in regno Domini in terris seu in Ecclesia, idem est; eadem quoque 
dicuntur doctrinalia, sed hoc a veris quae in illis; rationale angelicum et humanum est et vocatur rationale ex apparentiis veri illustratis a Divino; absque illis non est rationale; ita rationalia 
sunt illae. Quod hic dicatur quod `ad Aegyptum non descenderet,' hoc est, quod non ad scientifica, est quia de scientificis prius actum est, peregrinatio enim Abrahami in Aegypto, repraesentabat instructionem 
Domini in scientificis in pueritia, videatur n. 1502: cum arcano quod `non descenderet in Aegyptum, sed peregrinaretur in terra Geraris,' hoc est, quod non spectaret ad scientifica sed ad 
rationalia, ita se habet: [3] omnes apparentiae veri in quibus Divinum, sunt rationalis, usque adeo ut vera rationalia et apparentiae veri sint idem, scientifica autem sunt naturalis, usque adeo ut naturalia 
et vera scientifica {1}sint idem; vera rationalia, seu apparentiae veri, nusquam possunt esse et existere nisi ex influxu Divini in rationale, et per {2}rationalia in scientifica quae naturalis 
sunt; quae tunc fiunt in rationali apparent in naturali sicut multorum imago simul in speculo; ac ita sistuntur {3}coram homine, etiam coram angelo; sed coram angelo non ita evidenter in naturali, 
sed {4}apud illos qui in mundo spirituum, {5}et in spirituali naturali sunt, inde his repraesentativa veri; [4] similiter se habet apud unumquemvis hominem, nam, ut prius dictum, qui in bono est, exiguum 
caelum est, seu quod idem, imago caeli maximi, et quia Divinum Verum non immediate influere potest in scientifica quae sunt naturalis ejus hominis, sed per rationalia, ut dictum, ideo hic dicitur 
quod `non descenderet Aegyptum, sed resideret in terra Geraris': sed de his non potest clara idea haberi nisi sciatur {6}qualis influxus est, ut et quales ideae, quapropter de illis, ex Divina Domini 
Misericordia, ad finem capitum, ubi experientiae, agendum. @1 i quoque$  @2 rationale$  @3 i vera$  @4 i in commune$  @5 qui$  @6 i prius$  </p>
