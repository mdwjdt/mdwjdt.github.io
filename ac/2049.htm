<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2049节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2049.</strong>“不属于你种的一切外人”表那些教会外的人。这从“外人”的含义清楚可知，“外人”是指那些并非生在教会内、因而并非由信之善与真所主导的人，因为他们不知道信之善与真。“外人”也表示那些具有外在敬拜的人，如前所述（参看<a href="1097.htm">1097</a>节），尽管那里论述的主题是教会内的人。然而，此处的主题就广泛意义而言，是主的教会，故“外人”表那些并非生在教会内的人，如外邦人。教会外的外邦人可能拥有真理，但没有信之真理。他们的真理类似十诫，如当孝敬父母，不可杀人，不可偷盗，不可奸淫，不可贪恋他人财物，以及要敬拜神。然而，信之真理是关乎永生、主的国度和主自己的一切教导。外邦人不可能知道这类教导，因为他们没有圣言。<br />这些人就是“不属你种的外人”所表示的人，然而他们也要受割礼，即被洁净。由此明显可知，他们和教会中人一样，也能被洁净，这种洁净由他们受割礼来代表。当他们抛弃污秽的爱，彼此生活在仁爱中时，他们就被洁净。因为那时，真理会在他们的生活中发挥一定作用，因为所有真理都属于仁爱，但这类真理属于上述两种类型中的第一种。当这些真理在他们的生活中发挥一定作用时，他们很容易吸收信之真理，即便活在肉身时没能吸收，在来世也能吸收，因为信之真理是仁爱的内在真理。事实上，那时他们只渴望被引入仁爱的内在真理。构成主国度的，就是仁爱的内在真理（参看<a href="932.htm">932</a>，<a href="1032.htm">1032</a>，<a href="1059.htm">1059</a>，<a href="1327.htm">1327</a>，<a href="1328.htm">1328</a>，<a href="1366.htm">1366</a>节）。<br />在来世，仅有信之认知的知识毫无用处，因为最坏的人，甚至地狱里的人也能拥有这类知识，有时知道的比其他人还要多。照着这些认知所过的生活才是有用的，因为一切认知都以生活为目的。学习知识若不是为了生活，那么这些知识毫无用处，仅仅能使人们谈论它们，由此被视为世间有学问的人，被授予各种荣誉、赚取名利。由此明显可知，与信之认知一致的生活无非是仁爱的生活。事实上，爱主爱邻构成律法和先知，即信的全部教义，连同信的一切认知。谁都能从主的话（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.34.htm">22:34</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.39.htm">39</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.28.htm">12:28</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.35.htm">35</a>）清楚看出这一点。<br />然而，教义，或信之认知对于仁爱生命的形成是至关重要的。没有它们，仁爱的生命无法形成。这是死后救人的生命。没有仁爱生命的信之生命从来就不存在，因为没有仁爱，信的生命是不可能的。爱与仁居于其中的人有主的生命在里面。没人能凭其它生命与主结合。由此也明显可知，信之真理若不被植入在仁爱中，绝无法被视为真理；也就是说，承认它们是不可能的，除非表面上或口头上，因为它们从内在或从内心被否认。如前所述，一切信之真理都以仁爱为目的，若仁爱不存在于它们里面，那么它们会从内在被拒绝。外在之物被拿走（如来世的情形）后，内在事物的性质就会显明；也就是说，它们与一切信之真理完全相反。人在世时若没有接受仁爱的生命，那么在来世接受它是根本不可能的，因为他们厌恶并憎恨它。死后，诸如在世时与他们同在的生命会归于他们。事实上，他们厌恶并憎恨相爱。这种人仅仅靠近具有相爱生活的社群就会颤抖、战栗，感到痛苦。<br />这种人虽然生在教会内，但仍被称为“身心未受割礼的外邦人”，他们不会被允许进入圣所，即进入主的国度。以西结书所指的也是他们：<br />身心未受割礼的外邦人不可入圣所。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结44.7.htm">44:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结44.9.htm">9</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />在这样荣耀威势上，在伊甸园诸树中，谁能与你相比呢？然而你要与伊甸的诸树一同下到阴府，在未受割礼的人中与被刀杀的人一同躺卧。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结31.18.htm">31:18</a>）<br />这论及法老，法老表示总体上的记忆知识（<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>，<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>节）。他们要与之一同下到阴府的“伊甸诸树”也表记忆知识，不过是指那些信之认知的知识。由此明显可知，就内义而言，“未受割礼的”表示什么，即，是指处于污秽的爱欲和属于这些爱欲的生命之人。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2049</b></p><p><b>2049.</b>
From every son that is a stranger who is not of thy seed. That this signifies those who are outside the church, is evident from the signification of "son that is a stranger," as being those who are not 
born within the church, thus are not in the goods and truths of faith, because not in the knowledges of them. "Sons that are strangers" also signify those who are in external worship (concerning whom, 
n. 1097); but where this is the meaning, those who are within the church are treated of, whereas in the passage before us the Lord's church in the universal is treated of, and therefore "sons that 
are strangers" signify those who are not born within the church, as is the case with the Gentiles. Gentiles, who are outside the church, may be in truths, but not in the truths of faith. Their truths, 
like the precepts of the Decalogue, are that parents are to be honored, that men are not to kill, steal, commit adultery, or covet things that belong to others; also that the Deity is to be worshiped. 
But the truths of faith are all doctrinal things concerning eternal life, the Lord's kingdom, and the Lord Himself, which cannot be known to the Gentiles because they have not the Word.  [2] These 
are they who are signified by "sons that are strangers who are not of thy seed," and yet were to be circumcised, that is purified, together with them. This shows that they can be purified, equally with 
those within the church; as was represented by their being circumcised. They are purified when they reject filthy loves, and live with one another in charity; for then they live in truths, since all 
truths are of charity; but in the truths already mentioned. They who live in these truths readily imbibe the truths of faith, if not in the life of the body, yet in the other life, because the truths 
of faith are the interior truths of charity, and they then love nothing more than to be admitted into the interior truths of charity. The interior truths of charity are those in which the Lord's kingdom 
consists (see n. 932, 1032, 1059, 1327, 1328, 1366)  [3] In the other life a memory-knowledge of the knowledges of faith is of no avail, for the worst, nay, the infernals, can be in the memory-knowledge 
of them, sometimes more than others; but that which avails is a life according to the knowledges, for all knowledges have life as their end. Unless knowledges were learned for the sake of life, 
they would be of no use except that men might talk about them, and thereby be esteemed learned in the world, be exalted to honors, and gain reputation and wealth. From this it is evident that a life 
of the knowledges of faith is no other than a life of charity; for the Law and the Prophets, that is, the universal doctrine of faith together with all its knowledges, consists in love to the Lord and 
in love toward the neighbor; as is manifest to all from the Lord's words in Matthew 22:34-39 and Mark 12:28-35. [4] But still doctrinal things, that is, the knowledges of faith, are most necessary 
for forming the life of charity, which cannot be formed without them. This is the life that saves after death, and by no means any life of faith without it; for without charity there cannot be any life 
of faith. They who are in the life of love and charity are in the Lord's life, and by no other life can anyone be conjoined with Him. Hence also it is evident that the truths of faith can never be 
acknowledged as truths, that is, the acknowledgment of them so much talked of is impossible, except outwardly, and by the mouth, unless they are implanted in charity; for inwardly or in the heart they 
are denied, since, as already said, they all have charity as their end; and if this is not within them they are inwardly rejected. When the exteriors are taken away-as is done in the other life-the interiors 
are manifest in their true character, in that they are utterly contrary to all the truths of faith. When men have had no life of charity-that is, no mutual love-during their bodily life, it is 
utterly impossible to receive it in the other life, because they are averse to and hate it, for after death the same life remains with us that we have lived here. When such persons merely approach a 
society where there is the life of mutual love, they tremble, shudder, and feel torture.  [5] Such persons, although born within the church, are called "sons that are strangers, uncircumcised in heart 
and uncircumcised in flesh," who are not to be admitted into the sanctuary, that is, into the Lord's kingdom; and who are also meant in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     No son that is a stranger, uncircumcised in heart 
and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into My sanctuary (Ezek. 44:7, 9). Again: </p>
<p>     To whom art thou thus become like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? and thou shalt be brought 
down with the trees of Eden into the lower earth, thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword (Ezek. 31:18); </p>
<p>where Pharaoh is treated of, by whom are signified 
memory-knowledges in general (n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462); by "the trees of Eden" with which they should go down into the lower earth, are also signified memory-knowledges, but those of the knowledges 
of faith. All this shows what "the uncircumcised" is in the internal sense, namely, one who is in filthy loves and the life of them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2049</b></p><p><b>2049.</b>
'From every son who is a foreigner and not of your seed' means those outside the Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'son who is a foreigner' as those who are not born inside the Church and so 
are not governed by goods and truths of faith because they have no knowledge of them. 'Sons who are foreigners' also means people whose worship is external, dealt with in <a href="1097.htm">1097</a>, though in that context 
people inside the Church are the subject. Here however, the subject being the Lord's Church in its widest extent, 'sons who are foreigners' means those who, like gentiles, are not born inside the Church. 
Gentiles outside the Church can possess truths, but not the truths of faith. Their truths, like the Ten Commandments, are that parents should be honoured; that people should not murder, steal, commit 
adultery, or covet the things that belong to others; and also that they should worship God. Truths of faith consist however of all doctrinal teachings concerning eternal life, the Lord's kingdom, 
and the Lord. Such teachings cannot be known by gentiles because they do not possess the Word. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 These are the people who are meant by 'sons who are foreigners and not of your seed' but who are to 
be circumcised, that is to be purified. From this it is evident that they are just as much capable of being purified as those inside the Church, which purification was represented by being circumcised. 
They are purified when they cast aside filthy loves and live among one another in charity, for in their case truths have a part to play in their lives because charity and all truths go together, though 
such truths belong to the first of the two types mentioned above. When these truths play a part in their lives they then absorb the truths of faith with ease, if not during this life then in the 
next, because truths of faith are the interior truths of charity. Indeed at that point there is nothing they desire more than to be introduced into the interior truths of charity. Interior truths of 
charity are what constitute the Lord's kingdom. Regarding these, see <a href="932.htm">932</a>, <a href="1032.htm">1032</a>, <a href="1059.htm">1059</a>, <a href="1327.htm">1327</a>, <a href="1328.htm">1328</a>, <a href="1366.htm">1366</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the next life mere knowledge of the cognitions of faith is of no value at all, for the 
worst people, even those in hell, can have such knowledge, sometimes a better knowledge than others have. Leading a life in accordance with those cognitions is what matters, for all cognitions have life 
as their end in view. If life was not the reason for learning them they would have no use, apart from enabling people to discuss them and as a result to be considered learned in the world, to be raised 
to positions of importance, and to enhance reputation and wealth. From this it is clear that a life in keeping with the cognitions of faith is nothing other than the life of charity. Indeed love 
to the Lord and love towards the neighbour constitute the Law and the Prophets, that is, the doctrine of faith in its entirety together with all the cognitions of it, as is plain to anyone from the Lord's 
words in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2022:35-40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 22:35-40</a>, and <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2012:28-35&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 12:28-35</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Matters of doctrine, or cognitions of faith, are nevertheless absolutely vital for the formation of the life of charity; it cannot be formed without 
them. This is the life which saves a person after death. The life of faith never exists without the life of charity, for without charity the life of faith is impossible. People in whom the life 
of love and charity dwells have the Lord's life within them. Nobody can be joined to Him by means of any other life. From this it is also clear that the truths of faith cannot possibly be acknowledged 
as truths - that is, no acknowledgement of what they are saying is possible - other than outwardly or with the lips, if they are not implanted within charity, since inwardly or at heart they are denied. 
For as has been stated, all truths of faith have charity as their end in view, and if charity is not present within them then inwardly they are rejected. The nature of the things that are interior 
is plain to see when those that are exterior are taken away, as is done in the next life, namely that they are utterly contrary to all the truths of faith. No people can possibly receive the life of 
charity, or mutual love, in the next life, when they have had none in this life; but their life as it has been with them in the world remains with them after death. Indeed they are averse to and hate 
mutual love. When merely approaching a community where the life that belongs to mutual love exists they quiver and shake, and experience torment. </p>

 Although people such as these are born inside the 
Church, they are called 'sons who are foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in the flesh' who are not to be allowed into the sanctuary, that is, into the Lord's kingdom. They are also 
meant in Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
No son who is a foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter the sanctuary. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2044:7,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 44:7, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Whom have you thus become 
like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? You will be made to go down with the trees of Eden into the nether world; you will lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with those slain by the 
sword. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2031:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 31:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Pharaoh who means types of knowledge in general, <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>, <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>. 'The trees of Eden' with which they were to go down into the nether world also means types 
of knowledge, but knowledge of the cognitions of faith. From this it is now evident what 'one uncircumcised' means in the internal sense, namely one in whom filthy loves and the life belonging to these 
are present. </p>

`Ab omni filio alienigena, qui non e semine tuo ille': quod significet illos qui extra Ecclesiam sunt, constat a significatione `filii alienigenae' quod sint illi qui non nati intra Ecclesiam, ita non 
in bonis et veris fidei quia non in cognitionibus illorum; `filii alienigenae' etiam significant illos qui in externo cultu sunt, de quibus n. 1097, sed tunc agitur de illis qui intra Ecclesiam sunt; 
hic vero, quia de Ecclesia Domini in universali, sunt `filii alienigenae' illi qui non nati intra Ecclesiam, sicut sunt gentes: gentes quae extra Ecclesiam, possunt esse in veris sed non in veris fidei; 
vera eorum sunt sicut praecepta decalogi, quod honorandi parentes, quod non occidendum, non furandum, non adulterandum, non concupiscenda quae sunt aliorum, tum quod numen colendum; sed vera fidei 
sunt omnia doctrinalia de vita aeterna, de regno Domini, et de Domino; haec illis non possunt nota esse quia Verbum non habent; [2] hi sunt qui per `filios alienigenas, qui non e semine,' et qui {1} 
circumcidendi, hoc est, purificandi, significantur; inde {2} patet quod illi aeque purificari queant ac qui intra Ecclesiam, quod repraesentabatur per circumcidi; purificantur quando rejiciunt spurcos 
amores et vivunt inter se in charitate, tunc enim vivant in veris, nam omnia vera sunt charitatis, sed in veris de quibus prius; qui cum in his veris vivunt, facile hauriunt vera fidei, si non in vita 
corporis, usque in altera vita, quia vera fidei sunt interiora vera charitatis, nihil enim plus tunc amant quam in interiora vera charitatis admitti; interiora charitatis sunt, in quibus consistit 
regnum Domini, de illis videatur n. 932, 1032, 1059, 1327, 1328, 1366.  [3] In altera vita nihil facit scientia cognitionum fidei, pessimi enim, immo infernales, possunt esse in scientia illarum, quandoque 
prae aliis, sed est vita secundum cognitiones, nam omnes cognitiones pro fine habent vitam; nisi addiscerentur propter vitam, nullius usus forent, praeter quod loqui possint de iis, et inde docti 
haberi in mundo, in honores evehi, et lucrari famam et opes; inde constat quod vita cognitionum fidei non alia sit quam vita charitatis, Lex enim et Prophetae, hoc est, universa doctrina fidei cum 
omnibus ejus cognitionibus, consistit {3} in amore in Dominum, et in amore erga proximum, ut manifestum est unicuivis ex Domini verbis apud Matth. xxii 34-39, (o)et apud Marc. xii 28-35; [4] (m)at doctrinalia 
seu cognitiones fidei usque maxime necessariae sunt ad formandam vitam charitatis, quae absque illis formari nequit(n); haec vita est quae salvat {4} post mortem; nusquam aliqua vita fidei absque 
illa, nam absque charitate non dabilis est vita fidei; qui in vita amoris et charitatis sunt, in Domini vita sunt; Ipsi conjungi nemo potest per aliam; (m)inde quoque constat quod vera fidei nusquam 
agnosci queant ut vera, hoc est, dari agnitio illorum, de qua loquuntur, quam exterius aut {5} ore, nisi sint implantata in charitate, interius enim aut corde negantur, nam, ut dictum, omnia pro fine 
habent charitatem, quae si non inest, interius rejiciuntur; interiora patent qualia sunt cum auferuntur exteriora, ut fit in altera vita, quod nempe prorsus contraria sint omnibus veris fidei(n);

cum {6} modo approximant ad societatem ubi vita amoris mutui, tremunt, horrent et cruciatu afficiuntur(n): [5] tales tametsi intra Ecclesiam nati sunt, dicuntur `filii alienigenae praeputiati corde 
et praeputiati carne' qui non admittendi in sanctuarium, hoc est, in regnum Domini, qui etiam intellecti apud Ezechielem, 	Ullus filius alienigena, praeputiatus corde, et praeputiatus carne, non intrabit
