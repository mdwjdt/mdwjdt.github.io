<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6401节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6401.</strong>“使骑马的向后坠落”表一种远离（真理）。这从“向后坠落”和“骑马的”的含义清楚可知：“向后坠落”是指远离，即远离真理；“骑马的”是指那些陷入从最低级的属世层那里所获得的谬念之人。“马”表示这些谬念（参看<a href="6400.htm">6400</a>节）；因此，“骑马的”表示那些陷入这些谬念的人。此中含义是何性质，可参看刚才的讨论。由于“但”表示教会中那些诸如刚才（<a href="6400.htm">6400</a>节）所描述的那种人，他们因此在主国度的最低级部分，故“但”也表示那些从谬念当中孵化虚假，并散布它们的人。在耶利米书，这些人的虚假也被称为“马”，他们对真理和良善的推理被称为“蛇”：<br />从但那里听见他的马喷鼻气；他的壮马发嘶声，全地就都震动；因为他们来吞灭这地和其上所有的，吞灭这城与其中的居民。因为看哪！我必打发蛇、毒蛇到你们中间，是不服法术的，必咬你们。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶8.16.htm">8:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶8.17.htm">17</a>）</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6401</b></p><p><b>6401.</b>
And his rider shall fall backward. That this signifies that hence comes a receding, is evident from the signification of "falling backward," as being to recede, namely, from truth; and from the signification 
of "rider," as being one who is in fallacies from lowest nature. (That these fallacies are signified by "horse" may be seen above, n. 6400; and therefore by "rider" are signified they who are 
in fallacies. How the case herein is, has just been shown.) As by "Dan" are signified those within the church who are such as were described above (n. 6400), and who thus are among the last in the Lord's 
kingdom, therefore by "Dan" are also signified those who from fallacies hatch falsities and spread them about. Their falsities are also called "horses," and their reasonings about truth and good, 
"serpents," in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan; at the voice of the neighing of his strong ones the whole land trembled; and they are come and have devoured the land and 
the fullness thereof, the city and those that dwell therein. For behold I send among you serpents, vipers, which will not be charmed; and they shall bite you (Jer. 8:16-17). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6401</b></p><p><b>6401.</b>
'And its rider will fall backwards' means a receding from [truth]. This is clear from the meaning of 'falling backwards' as a receding from - a receding from truth; and from the meaning of 'rider' as 
those subject to false notions received from lowest nature. 'Horse' means those false notions, see immediately above in <a href="6400.htm">6400</a>, and therefore 'rider' means those subject to them, the nature of which meanings 
has been discussed immediately above. Since 'Dan' means those within the Church who are the kind of people described just above in <a href="6396.htm">6396</a> and who are accordingly among the lowest in the Lord's kingdom, 
'Dan' also means those who hatch false teachings out of false notions and disseminate them. These people's false teachings are also called 'horses', and their reasonings about truth and good are 
called 'serpents', in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
From Dan the snorting of his horses was heard; at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones the whole earth quaked. And they came and devoured the land and the 
fullness of it, the city and those dwelling in it. For behold, I send into you poisonous serpents which do not respond to charming; and they will bite you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%208:16,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 8:16, 17</a>.

`Et cadet eques ejus retrorsum': quod significet quod inde recessio, constat a significatione `cadere retrorsum' quod sit recedere, nempe a vero; et a significatione `equitis' quod sit qui in fallaciis 
ex infima natura; quod {1} per `equum' fallaciae illae significentur, videatur mox supra n. 6400, quare per `equitem' significantur illi qui in fallaciis sunt; haec quomodo se habent, mox supra dictum 
est.  (s)Quia per `Danem' significantur illi intra Ecclesiam qui tales sunt sicut descripti mox supra n. 6396, et qui sic {2}inter ultimos sunt in regno Domini, idcirco per `Danem' etiam significantur 
qui falsa ex fallaciis excludunt et circumspargunt; horum falsa quoque vocantur `equi', et {3}ratiocinationes de vero et bono `serpentes', {4}apud Jeremiam, A Dane auditus fremitus equorum ejus, 
a voce hinnituum fortium ejus, contremuit omnis terra, et venerunt et consumpserunt terram et plenitudinem ejus, urbem et habitantes in ea; quia ecce Ego mitto in vos serpentes regulos, quibus non incantatio, 
et mordebunt vos, viii (x)16, 17.(s) @1 i enim$ @2 in ultimis$ @3 ratiocinia$ @4 i et quod illa consumant ea quae Ecclesiae sunt,$ </p>
