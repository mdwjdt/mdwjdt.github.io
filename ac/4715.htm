<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4715节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4715.</strong>“于是打发他出希伯仑谷”表从神性属世和感官层发出。这从“打发”、“谷”和“希伯仑”的含义清楚可知：“打发”是指发出并教导（<a href="4710.htm">4710</a>节）；“谷”是指那些在下面的事物（<a href="1723.htm">1723</a>，<a href="3417.htm">3417</a>节）；“希伯仑”是指主之教会的良善（<a href="2909.htm">2909</a>节）。因此，这些话在此表示它要教导教会的低级事物，因为人们不理解高级事物。事实上，教导信，不教导仁的人绝无可能发觉教会的高级或内在事物；因为他没有引导他看见，并指示他某个具体观念是不是信仰的一部分，或是不是真理的必要资本。但是，他若教导仁爱，就会拥有良善。这良善对他来说就是真理，并引导他；因为一切真理皆源于良善，并与良善有关；或也可说，信的一切皆源于仁，并与仁有关。仅凭属世之光，谁都能知道，教义的一切事物都关注生活。<br />这些话表示从神性属世和感官层发出，这层含义就是它们的高级意义。因为“教会的低级事物”用来描述那些来源于主的神性属世和感官层的事物。并不是说在主里面，这些事物都是低级的，因为在主及其神性人身里面，一切事物都是无限的；事实上，祂在两个本质上都是耶和华（<a href="2156.htm">2156</a>，<a href="2329.htm">2329</a>，<a href="2921.htm">2921</a>，<a href="3023.htm">3023</a>节）。这些事物之所以低级，是因为对人来说，情形就是如此。那些系感官人的人凭感官来理解在主里面并从主发出的事物，而属世之人则以属世观念来理解它们。之所以这么说是由于接受者的性质。然而，那些系属天人，因而真正理性的人能觉察到内在事物。对于他们，可以说，他们出于主的神性理性层教导人。如前所述，这就是这些话的高级意义。<br />“谷”表示教会的低级事物，这一点从圣言中的其它经文明显看出来。如以赛亚书：<br />论异象谷的预言：有什么事使你们上去，全都上房顶呢？因为主万军之耶和华使异象谷有溃乱、践踏、烦扰的日子。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛22.1.htm">22:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛22.5.htm">5</a>）<br />“异象谷”表示关于属灵事物的谬念或幻想，这些谬念是由感官印象，因而由低级事物形成的。<br />你佳美的谷遍满战车，也有马兵在城门前排列。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛22.7.htm">22:7</a>）<br />“佳美的谷”表示属世人或外在人里面的良善与真理。<br />在旷野有人声喊着说，预备耶和华的路，修平我们神的道。一切山谷都要填高。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.3.htm">40:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.4.htm">4</a>）<br />“谷”表示低级事物。<br />耶利米书：<br />你怎能说，我没有玷污，没有随从众巴力？你看你谷中的路，就知道你所行的如何。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.23.htm">2:23</a>）<br />“谷”表示记忆知识或事实知识和感官印象，也就是他们用来败坏真理的低级事物。<br />耶和华说，住山谷和平原磐石上的居民，我与你们为敌；你们说：谁能下来攻击我们？（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶21.13.htm">21:13</a>）<br />“住山谷和平原磐石上的居民”表示没有仁在里面的信。<br />行毁灭的必来到各城，并无一城得免。山谷必至败落，平原必被毁坏。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶48.8.htm">48:8</a>）<br />此处意思也一样。<br />背道的女子哪，你们为何因有山谷，就是水流的山谷夸张呢？（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.4.htm">49:4</a>）<br />“山谷”表示敬拜中的外在事物，也就是最低层。<br />以西结书：<br />我必在以色列给歌革一块坟地，就是他们所经过的谷；在那里，他们必葬埋歌革和他的群众，就称那地为哈们歌革谷。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结39.11.htm">39:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结39.15.htm">15</a>）<br />“歌革”表示那些处于没有内在的外在敬拜之人（<a href="1151.htm">1151</a>节），他的坟地因此被称为“他们所经过的谷”和“哈们歌革谷”。诗篇：<br />我虽然行过幽谷，也不怕遭害。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗23.4.htm">23:4</a>）<br />“幽谷”表示低级事物，相对来说，这些事物在幽暗中。<br />由于山谷在大山和小山之间，并且在它们下面，故“山谷”表示教会的低级或外在事物；因为“小山”和“大山”表示它的高级或内在事物，“小山”表示仁爱的事物，“大山”表示对主之爱的事物（<a href="795.htm">795</a>，<a href="1430.htm">1430</a>，<a href="2722.htm">2722</a>，<a href="4210.htm">4210</a>节）。由于“迦南地”表示主的国度和祂的教会，所以教会被称为“有山有谷，天上的雨水滋润之地”（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申11.11.htm">11:11</a>）。此处之所以说约瑟被打发出希伯仑谷，是因为他被差遣到那些教导信的人那里（参看<a href="4705.htm">4705</a>节）。那些处于信，却未处于仁的人执守低级事物；因为在他们当中，信只存于记忆，由此挂在嘴上，而不是存于内心，由此存于行为。</p>

And he sent him out of the valley of Hebron. That this signifies from the natural and sensuous Divine, is evident from the signification of "to be sent," as being to proceed and to teach (see n. 4710); 
and from the signification of a "valley" as being those things which are below (n. 1723, 3417); and from the signification of "Hebron" as being the Lord's church as to good (n. 2909). Thus by these 
words is signified that it taught the lower things of the church, and this because they did not comprehend higher things. For he who teaches faith, and not charity, is unable to notice the higher or 
interior things of the church; because he has nothing to guide him, and to dictate whether this or that is of faith, or is true. But if he teaches charity, he then has good, and this is to him a dictate 
and guides him; for all truth is from good and treats of good, or what is the same, everything of faith is from charity and treats of charity. Everyone, from mere natural light, can know that everything 
of doctrine has regard to life. [2] That by these words is signified from the natural and sensuous Divine, is the higher sense; for the lower things of the church are said to be from the Lord's 
natural and sensuous Divine; not that in the Lord these things are lower, because in the Lord and in His Divine Human all is infinite, inasmuch as He is Jehovah as to each essence (n. 2156, 2329, 2921, 
3023), but because it is so in man. For those who are sensuous men apprehend sensuously the things which are in the Lord and from Him, and those who are natural apprehend them naturally. It is so said 
because of the quality of those who receive. But those who are celestial men, and thence truly rational, perceive interior things, and it is said of them that they are taught from the Lord's rational 
Divine. This as before said is the higher sense signified by the words. [3] That a "valley" is the lower things of the church, is evident from other passages in the Word, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The 
prophecy of the valley of vision. What hast thou here, that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops? It is a day of tumult, and of treading down, and of perplexity, to the Lord Jehovih Zebaoth, in the 
valley of vision (Isa. 22:1, 5); </p>
<p>the "valley of vision" denotes phantasies concerning spiritual things from sensuous, thus from lower things. Again: </p>
<p>     The choice of thy valleys were full of chariots, 
and the horsemen placing placed themselves at the gate (Isa. 22:7); </p>
<p>the "choice of the valleys" denotes good and true things in the natural or external man. Again: </p>
<p>     The voice of one crying 
in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of Jehovah, make level in the solitude a pathway for our God; every valley shall be exalted (Isa. 40:3-4); </p>
<p>a "valley" denotes low things.  [4] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p> 
    How sayest thou, I am not defiled, I have not gone after the Baalim? See thy way in the valley, acknowledge what thou hast done (Jer. 2:23); </p>
<p>where "valley" denotes things of the memory and of the 
senses, which are lower things by which they perverted truths. Again:  I am against thee O inhabitress of the valley, and rock of the plain, saith Jehovah; who say, Who will come down against us? (Jer. 
21:13); </p>
<p>the "inhabitress of the valley and rock of the plain" denote faith in which there is no charity. Again: </p>
<p>     The waster shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape; but the valley 
shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed (Jer. 48:8); </p>
<p>with a similar meaning. Again: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt not glory in the valleys; thy valley hath flowed away, O perverse daughter (Jer. 49:4); </p>
<p>"valley" 
denotes external things in worship, which are also the lowest. [5] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     I will give to Gog a place for burial in Israel, the valley of them that pass through, and there shall they 
bury Gog and all his multitude; whence they shall call it, The valley of the multitude of Gog (Ezek. 39:11, 15); </p>
<p>"Gog" denotes those who are in external worship without internal (n. 1151), whence 
his burial place is called "the valley of them that pass through," and "the valley of the multitude of Gog." In David: </p>
<p>     Yea, when I walk through the valley of shadow I will fear no evil (Ps. 23:4); </p>
<p>where 
the "valley of shadow" denotes lower things, which are relatively in shade. [6] As valleys were between mountains and hills, and below them, therefore by "valleys" are signified the lower 
or exterior things of the church, because by hills and mountains are signified its higher or interior things, by "hills" things which are of charity, and by "mountains" those which are of love to the 
Lord (n. 795, 1430, 2722, 4210); and as by the land of Canaan is signified the Lord's kingdom and His church, therefore it is called "a land of mountains and valleys, that drinketh water of the rain of 
heaven" (Deut. 11:11). That Joseph is here said to have been sent out of the valley of Hebron is because the mission was to those who taught concerning faith (see n. 4705); for those who are in faith, 
and not in charity, are in lower things; because with them faith is only in the memory and thence in the mouth, but not in the heart and thence in the work. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4715</b></p><p><b>4715.</b>
'And he sent him out of the Valley of Hebron' means going forth from the Divine Natural and Sensory degrees. This is clear from the meaning of 'being sent' as going forth and teaching, dealt with above 
in <a href="4710.htm">4710</a>; from the meaning of 'a valley' as things that are low, dealt with in <a href="1723.htm">1723</a>, <a href="3417.htm">3417</a>; and from the meaning of 'Hebron' as the Lord's Church as regards good, dealt with in <a href="2909.htm">2909</a>. The words used at 
this point accordingly mean that it was to teach the lower things of the Church, for the reason that people would not grasp the higher ones. Indeed one who teaches faith and not charity cannot possibly 
discern the higher and more internal things of the Church since he does not possess the wherewithal that leads him to see and lays down for him whether a particular idea is part of faith or is the 
truth. But if he teaches charity he is in that case in possession of good. Good lays down the truth for him and leads him, for all truth stems from good and has to do with good; or what amounts to the 
same, every aspect of faith stems from charity and has to do with charity. The fact that everything taught by doctrine has regard to life anybody can recognize from natural enlightenment alone. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
The meaning 'going forth from the Divine Natural and Sensory degrees' carried by the words used here is their higher meaning. For the expression 'lower things of the Church' is used to describe those 
which have their origin in the Lord's Divine Natural and Sensory degrees. Not that within the Lord these things are lower ones - for within the Lord and within His Divine Human everything is Infinite, 
indeed He is Jehovah as regards both Essences, <a href="2156.htm">2156</a>, <a href="2329.htm">2329</a>, <a href="2921.htm">2921</a>, <a href="3023.htm">3023</a>. Those things are lower because of what the situation is with man. People who are sensory-minded rely on ideas as grasped by the 
senses to think of things which exist within the Lord and which go forth from the Lord, and those who are natural-minded rely on natural ideas. The nature of the recipients is the reason for the way 
any matter is stated. People however who are heavenly-minded and are as a consequence truly rational do perceive interior things. These are the ones of whom it is said that they teach from the Lord's 
Divine Rational. This, as has been stated, is the higher meaning which these words carry. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The meaning of 'a valley' as the lower things of the Church may be seen from other places in the Word, 
as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The prophecy of the valley of vision. What is this, that you have gone up, every one onto the housetops? The Lord Jehovih Zebaoth has a day of tumult and of trampling and of confusion 
in the valley of vision <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2022:1,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 22:1, 5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The valley of vision' stands for false notions about spiritual things - notions formed from sensory impressions, and so from lower things. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The 
choicest of your valleys were filled with chariots, and the horsemen positioned themselves at the gate. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2022:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 22:7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p> 'The choicest of the valleys' stands for goods and truths within the 
natural or external man. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of Jehovah; make plain in the lonely place a highway for our God; every valley will be lifted 
up. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2040:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 40:3, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Valley' stands for things that are lowly. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
How will you say, I have not been defiled, I have not gone after the baalim. Look at your way in the valley; acknowledge 
what you have done. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%202:23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 2:23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The valley' stands for factual knowledge and sensory impressions, which are lower things, by means of which they would pervert truths. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
I 
am against you, O inhabitant of the volley, O rock of the plain, said Jehovah, you who say, Who will come clown against us? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2021:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 21:13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Inhabitant of the valley' and 'rock of the plain' stand 
for faith which has no charity in it. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
He who lays waste will come upon every city, and no city will escape; but the valley will perish, and the plain will be destroyed. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2048:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 48:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the meaning is similar. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
You will not boast of valleys; your valley has flowed away, O perverse daughter. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2049:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 49:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Valley' stands for the external things within 
worship which are also the lowest. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
I will give to Gog a place for burial in Israel, the valley of those that pass over. There they will bury Gog and all his multitude, from 
which they will call it the valley of the multitude of Gog. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2039:11,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 39:11, 15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Gog' stands for those whose worship is external devoid of internal, <a href="1151.htm">1151</a>, which is why the expressions 'his grave', 'the 
valley of those that pass over', and 'the valley of his multitude' are used. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Even when I walk in the valley of the shadow I will fear no evil. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2023:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 23:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The valley of the shadow' stands 
for lower things which, compared with others, are in shadow. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 Because valleys lay between mountains and hills and beneath them, 'valleys' therefore means the lower or more external things of 
the Church; for 'hills' and 'mountains' mean the higher or more internal things of it, 'hills' things of charity and 'mountains' those of love to the Lord, <a href="795.htm">795</a>, <a href="1430.htm">1430</a>, <a href="2722.htm">2722</a>, <a href="4210.htm">4210</a>. And because 'the land 
of Canaan' means the Lord's kingdom and His Church, that Church is therefore called, </p>
<blockquote>
A land of mountain's and valleys, on the arrival of the rain of heaven it drinks water. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2011:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 11:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The reason 
Joseph is said at this point of have been sent out of the Valley of Hebron is that he was sent to those who taught about faith, <a href="4705.htm">4705</a>.  Those who are governed by faith, not by charity, adhere to 
lower things, for with them faith exists merely in the memory and consequently on the lips, not in the heart and consequently in action. </p>

`Et misit eum e valle Hebronis': quod significet ex Naturali et Sensuali Divino, constat ex significatione `mitti' quod sit procedere et docere, de qua supra n. 4710 ex significatione `vallis' quod 
sint illa quae infra sunt, de qua n. 1723, 3417; et ex significatione `Hebronis' quod sit Ecclesia Domini quoad bonum, de qua n. 2909, ita per illa verba significatur quod doceret illa quae inferiora 
Ecclesiae sunt, et hoc ideo quia superiora non caperent; qui enim fidem docet et non charitatem, is nusquam superiora seu interiora Ecclesiae appercipere potest, non enim habet quicquam quod 
ducit, et quod dictat {1} num hoc fidei sit vel num hoc verum, at si docet charitatem, tunc habet bonum; hoc ei dictamen est et eum ducit, nam omne verum est ex bono et agit de bono, seu quod idem, 
omne fidei est ex charitate et agit de charitate; quod omne doctrinae spectet vitam, unusquisque ex solo lumine naturali scire potest.  [2] Quod per illa verba significetur ex Naturali et Sensuali

Humano omne est Infinitum, est enim Jehovah quoad utramque Essentiam, n. 2156, 2329, 2921, 3023, sed quia ita est apud hominem; qui enim sensuales homines sunt, sensualiter capiunt illa quae in Domino 
sunt et quae ex Domino, et qui naturales naturaliter; ex qualitate (c)illorum qui recipiunt, ita dicitur; qui autem caelestes homines sunt et inde vere rationales, illi interiora percipiunt de 
illis dicitur quod doceantur ex Rationali Divino Domini; hic es sensus superior, ut dictum, qui per illa verba significatur {2}.  [3] Quod `vallis' sint inferiora Ecclesiae, constare potest ab aliis
