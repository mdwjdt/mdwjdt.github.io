<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5849节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5849.</strong>与人相联的两个灵人使他与地狱交流，而两位天使则使他与天堂交流。没有与天堂并地狱的交流，人甚至片刻不能存活。如果这些交流被夺走，此人就会像一根木头那样仆倒死亡。因为如果它们被夺走，与最初存在或存在的最初源头，也就是主的联系就会被夺走。这一点也通过大量经历向我证明。与我同在的灵人被挪离了一点，然后随着他们离开，我几乎快要死了；事实上，如果不把他们送回来，我早就气绝身亡了。不过我知道，很少有人相信有什么灵人与他们同在，甚至不相信灵人的存在。这主要是由于如今没有了信仰，因为没有了仁爱；因此，没有人相信地狱的存在，甚至没有人相信天堂的存在，因而死后生命的存在。另外一个原因是，他们没有亲眼看见灵人，因为他们说：“我若看见，就会相信；我所看见的，是存在的；但我没有看见的，我不知道是否存在。”然而，他们知道或能知道人的肉眼如此粗糙和有限，以致它甚至看不见属世创造的可观察的细节，这从使得这类细节可见的显微镜明显看出来。那么，它又如何能看见存在于灵人和天使所在的更纯粹创造中的事物呢？人若不用其内在人的眼睛，是看不见这些人的；因为内在人的眼睛适应看这类事物。但这眼睛的视见因种种原因而没有向活在世上的人打开。由此明显可知，当今的信仰距离古时的信仰何等遥远。古时的信仰是，每个人都有自己的天使与他同在。</p>

The two spirits adjoined to man cause him to be in communication with hell, and the two angels cause him to be in communication with heaven. Without communication with heaven and hell, man could not 
live even a moment. If these communications were taken away, the man would fall dead as a stock; for then would be taken away the connection with the First Esse, that is, with the Lord. This has also 
been shown me by much experience. The spirits with me were removed a little, and then as they were removed I began as it were to expire, and indeed should have expired if they had not been sent back. 
But I know that few will believe there is any spirit with them, nor even that there are any spirits; and this chiefly for the reason that at this day there is no faith, because no charity, and thus it 
is not believed that there is a hell, nor even that there is a heaven, nor consequently that there is any life after death. Another reason is that they do not see spirits with their eyes; for they say, 
"If I should see, I would believe; what I see, this is; but what I do not see, I do not know whether it is." When yet they know, or might know, that man's eye is so dull and gross that it does not 
even see many things that exist in ultimate nature, as is evident from microscopes which make them visible. How then could it see what is within even purer nature, where spirits and angels are? These 
man cannot see except with the eye of his internal man, for this is accommodated to such vision. But the sight of this eye is not opened to man while he is in this world, for many reasons. From all this 
it is evident how far distant is the faith of this day from the faith of ancient times, when it was believed that every man had his angel with him. </p>

The two spirits who are linked to a person provide a communication with hell, while the two angels provide a communication with heaven. Without the communication with heaven and hell a person could not 
go on living for even a moment. If the two lines of communication were taken away the person would fall down lifeless as a log, for if they were removed his connection with the Primary Source of Being, 
which is the Lord, would be taken away. I have also had this demonstrated to me by experience. The spirits with me began to be taken a little distance away; and then as they departed I began almost 
to expire, and I would have expired if they had not been sent back. But I realize few believe that any spirit is present with them, or indeed that spirits exist at all. The chief reason for this is 
that at the present day there is no faith because there is no charity, and therefore no one believes in the existence of hell, or indeed of heaven either, or consequently in life after death. A further 
reason for that lack of belief is that they do not see spirits with their eyes; for they say, 'If I could see them I would believe in them; what I can see exists, but whether what I cannot see exists 
I do not know'. Yet they do know or are capable of knowing that the human eye is so deficient and limited that it cannot see even the more observable details of the natural creation, as is made evident 
from optical devices which make such details visible. So how is the eye going to be able to see things that exist within an even purer creation where spirits and angels are? These cannot be seen 
by a person except with the eye of his internal man; for that eye is suited to beholding such things. But the sight of this eye is not opened for a person while he is in the world, for a number of reasons. 
All this shows how far removed belief is at the present day from the belief of old. The belief of old was that each individual person had his own angel residing with him. </p>

Bini illi spiritus qui adjuncti sunt homini, faciunt ut communicatio sit cum inferno, et bini illi angeli faciunt ut communicatio sit cum caelo; homo absque communicatione cum caelo et inferno ne quidem 
momento vivere posset; si {1}communicationes illae auferrentur, caderet homo mortuus sicut stipes, nam tunc auferretur nexus cum Primo {2}Esse, hoc est, cum Domino. Hoc quoque mihi per experientiam 
ostensum est; removebantur paulum spiritus apud me, et tunc secundum remotionem quasi exspirare coepi, et quoque exspiravissem nisi remissi fuissent. (s)Sed scio quod pauci credant quod aliquis spiritus 
sit {3}apud se, immo quod aliqui spiritus sint; ex causa praecipue quod hodie nulla fides quia nulla charitas, inde nec creditur quod infernum sit, immo nec quod caelum, consequenter non vita post 
mortem; altera causa est quia oculis suis non vident spiritus, dicunt enim, `Si viderem, crederem; quod video, id est; quod autem non video, non scio an sit': cum tamen sciunt aut scire possunt quod 
oculus hominis tam hebes et crassus sit ut ne quidem videat exstantiora quae in ultima natura, quod patet (c)a vitris artificialibus per quae talia apparent; quomodo tunc videre poterit quae sunt intra 
naturam etiam puriorem ubi sunt spiritus et angeli; hos {4}homo non videre potest nisi {5}oculo interni sui hominis, {5}ille enim {5}est accommodatus talibus videndis; sed hujus oculi visus non aperitur 
homini cum est in mundo, ex pluribus causis. Ex his constare potest quantum fides hodierna distat a fide antiqua, fides antiqua fuit quod unusquisque homo haberet apud se suum angelum.(s) @1 communicatio
