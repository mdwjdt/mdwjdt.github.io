<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6494节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6494.</strong>多年来，我一直仔细观察，以查看是否有诸如运气之类的事发生。我发现是有的，在这种情况下，小心谨慎是无济于事的。此外，凡长时间地思考这个问题的人都知道并承认这是真的，尽管他们不知道事情为什么会是这样。几乎没有人知道运气来源于灵界；然而，灵界的确是它的源头。在一次社交聚会上，我曾玩过一个碰运气的掷骰游戏；与我同在的灵人对我说了游戏中的运气。他们说，好运向他们显为一团亮云，霉运则显为一团乌云；当乌云在我身边出现时，我不可能赢。他们通过这个迹象还向我预言了这个游戏中的运气变化。我由此得以知道人们归于运气的事，哪怕是游戏中的，都来源于灵界；人在一生中所遇到的命运变迁更是如此。被称为运气的事是由圣治或天命在终极秩序中的流注产生的，它在终极秩序中就显为运气。因此，正是圣治或天命在一切事的最具体方面运行，照主的话说，神若不愿意，连一根头发也不会从头上掉落。</p>

For a number of years I have carefully observed whether fortune is anything, and I have found that it is, and that sagacity then availed nothing. Moreover all who have long reflected on this subject, 
know and confess this, but they do not know whence it is: scarcely anyone knows that it is from the spiritual world, when yet this is the source of it. I once played in company a common game of chance 
with dice, and the spirits who were with me spoke to me about fortune in games, and said that what is fortunate was represented to them by a bright cloud, and what is unfortunate by a dusky cloud; and 
that when a dusky cloud appeared with me, it was impossible for me to win; moreover by this sign they predicted to me the turns of fortune in that game. From this it was given me to know that what 
is attributed to fortune, even in games, is from the spiritual world; much more that which befalls man in relation to the vicissitudes in the course of his life; and that what is called fortune is from 
the influx of Providence in the ultimates of order, where it so comes forth; thus that Providence is in the veriest singulars of all things, according to the Lord's words, that not even a hair falls 
from the head without the will of God. </p>

For many years I watched carefully to see whether there was any such thing as fortune. I discovered that there was, and that prudence was not in that case of any avail. Furthermore all who have reflected 
on the matter for a long time know and confess this to be true, though they do not know why it is so. Scarcely anyone knows that fortune has its origin in the spiritual world; yet that is where it 
does indeed originate. In a social gathering I once played a commonly known game of chance in which dice are used, while the spirits present with me spoke to me about fortune in games. They said that 
good fortune was represented to them by means of a bright cloud, and ill fortune by means of a sombre one, and that when a sombre cloud was seen near me I could never win. Seeing that sign they were 
also foretelling to me the changes of fortune that took place in the game. From this I wished to know that what people attribute to fortune, even in games, has its origin in the spiritual world; this 
is even more true with regard to the changing fortunes that befall a person during the course of his life. What is called fortune results from the entry of Providence into the last and lowest degrees 
of order, in which it manifests itself as fortune. Thus it is that Providence is at work in the most specific aspects of everything, as accords with the Lord's words that not even a hair falls from one's 
head unless God wills it. </p>

Per plures annos sedulo observavi num fortuna esset aliquid,  et compertus sum quod esset, et quod prudentia tunc nihil faceret; omnes etiam qui diu super id reflexerunt, hoc sciunt et fatentur, sed 
non sciunt unde id; quod sit e spirituali mundo via aliquis novit, cum tamen inde est.  Quondam cum ludi ludum familiarem {1}aleae cum talis in conversatione, {2}spiritus qui apud me, loquebantur mecum 
de fortuna in ludis, et dicebant quod fortunatum illis repraesentaretur per nubem candidam, et quod infortunatum per nubem fuscam; et cum apud me appareret nubes fusca quod {3}nequaquam vincere possem; 
et quoque ex illo indicio praedicebant mihi fortunae vices in illo ludo; inde scire datum quod id quod tribuitur fortunae, etiam in ludis, sit ex spirituali mundo; magis id quod homini contingit quoad 
vices in ejus vitae cursu; et quod id quod fortuna vocatur sit {4}ex influxu Providentiae in ultimis ordinis ubi ita existit; ita quod Providentia sit in omnium singularissimis, secundum Domini verba, 
quod `ne quidem capillus decidat de capite absque voluntate {5}Dei'. @1 in alea conversatione cum talis$ @2 erant apud me, et$ @3 nullatenus$ @4 influxus$ @5 A d Ipsius i Dei$ </p>
