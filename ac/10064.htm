<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10064节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10064</strong>.“并要把血洒在坛的周围”表神性真理与神性良善的合一。这从“血”和“坛”的含义清楚可知：当论及祭牲和燔祭时，“血”是指神性真理（参看<a href="10026.htm">10026</a>，<a href="10033.htm">10033</a>节）；“坛”是指神性良善方面的主的一个代表（<a href="9964.htm">9964</a>节）。当提到神性良善时，也是指神性之爱，因为一切良善皆属于爱；事实上，凡人们所爱的，他们都感觉为良善，并因此也称之为良善。但一切真理皆属于信；因为凡人们所信的，他们都视为真理，也称之为真理。由此可推知，那些构成人的理解力的事物属于信，那些构成意愿的事物属于爱，因为人的理解力致力于接受属于信的真理，他的意愿致力于接受属于爱的良善。因此，构成人的理解力的真理如何，这理解力就如何，或说人的理解力的性质取决于构成它的真理的性质；构成人的意愿的良善，以及对这些良善的爱如何，这意愿就如何，或说人的意愿的性质取决于构成它的良善的性质，以及他对这些良善的爱。就反面意义而言，对邪恶的爱和对虚假的信，以及由这些所构成的一个意愿和理解力也是存在的。不过，构成理解力的虚假，以及对虚假的信如何，这理解力就如何，或说理解力的性质取决于构成它的虚假的性质，以及对这虚假之信的性质；构成意愿的邪恶，对这邪恶的爱如何，这意愿就如何，或说意愿的性质取决于构成它的邪恶的性质，以及对该邪恶的爱之性质。由邪恶构成的意愿和由虚假构成的理解力来自地狱，它们构成与人同在的地狱，这是不言而喻的，因为它们与由真理构成的理解力和由良善构成的意愿对立，而这样的理解力和意愿来自天堂，源于主，因而构成与人同在的天堂。</p>

And thou shalt sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. That this signifies the unition of Divine truth with Divine good, is evident from the signification of "blood," when said of the sacrifice 
and burnt-offering, as being Divine truth (see above, n. 10026, 10033); and from the signification of "the altar," as being a representative of the Lord as to Divine good (n. 9964). When Divine good 
is mentioned, Divine love is also meant, because all good is of love, for whatever is loved is perceived as good, and consequently is also called good. But all truth is of faith; for whatever is believed 
is perceived as truth, and is also so called. From this it follows that those things which form the understanding of man are of faith, and those which form the will are of love, for the understanding 
of man has been set apart to receive the truths of faith, and his will to receive the goods of love. The understanding of man is therefore such as are the truths which form it, and such as is the 
faith of these truths; and the will of man is such as are the goods which make it, and such as is the love of these goods. In the opposite sense there are the love of evil and the faith of falsity, and 
from these also a will and understanding; but the understanding is such as is the falsity which forms it, and as is the faith of the falsity; and the will is such as is the evil which makes it, and 
as is the love of the evil. That the will of evil and the understanding of falsity are from hell, and that they are hell with man, is evident, because they are opposite to the understanding of truth 
and the will of good, which are from heaven from the Lord, and thus make heaven with man. </p>

'And you shall sprinkle the blood over the altar round about' means the uniting of Divine Truth to Divine Good. This is clear from the meaning of 'the blood', when it refers to the sacrifice and burnt 
offering, as Divine Truth, dealt with above in <a href="10026.htm">10026</a>, <a href="10033.htm">10033</a>; and from the meaning of 'the altar' as that which is representative of the Lord in respect of Divine Good, dealt with in <a href="9964.htm">9964</a>. When the words 
'Divine Good' are used Divine Love is also meant. For all good belongs to love; indeed whatever people love they perceive to be good and therefore also call it good. But all truth belongs to faith; 
for whatever people believe they perceive to be and also call the truth. From this it follows that the things which compose the human understanding belong to faith and those that compose the will belong 
to love; for a person's understanding is dedicated to receiving truths that belong to faith and his will to receiving forms of good that belong to love. The character therefore of a person's understanding 
is determined by that of the truths which compose it and by that of his belief in them; and the character of a person's will is determined by that of the forms of good which constitute it and 
by that of his love of them. In the contrary sense there is a love of evil and belief in falsity, and also a will and understanding consisting of these. But the character of the understanding is determined 
by that of the falsity which composes it and by that of the belief in this falsity; and the character of the will is determined by that of the evil which constitutes it and by that of the love 
of this evil. The fact that a will consisting of evil and an understanding consisting of falsity come from hell, and that they constitute hell with a person, is self-evident, for they are the opposites 
of an understanding consisting of truth and a will consisting of good, which come from heaven and originate in the Lord, and so which constitute heaven with a person.  </p>

`Et sparges sanguinem super altare circumcirca': quod significet unitionem Divini Veri cum Divino Bono, constat ex significatione `sanguinis' cum de sacrificio et holocausto, quod sit Divinum Verum, 
de qua supra n. 10,026, 10,033, et ex significatione `altaris' quod sit `repraesentativum Domini quoad Divinum Bonum', de qua n. 9964; cum dicitur Divinum Bonum, intelligitur etiam Divinus Amor, nam 
omne bonum est amoris, quicquid enim amatur, hoc percipitur (o)ut bonum, et (o)inde quoque vocatur bonum; omne autem verum est fidei, nam quicquid creditur, hoc appercipitur et quoque dicitur verum; inde 
sequitur quod illa quae intellectum hominis formant sint fidei, et illa quae voluntatem, sint amoris, nam intellectus hominis dicatus est recipiendis veris quae fidei, ac voluntas ejus dicata est 
recipiendis bonis quae amoris; talis itaque est intellectus hominis qualia' sunt vera quae formant illum, et qualis est fides (c)eorum; et talis est voluntas hominis qualia sunt bona quae faciunt illam, 
et qualis est amor illorum; in opposito sensu est amor mali et fides falsi, inde etiam voluntas et intellectus {2}, sed talis est intellectus quale est falsum quod format illum, et qualis est fides 
falsi; ac talis est voluntas quale est malum quod facit illam, et qualis est amor mali; quod voluntas mali ac intellectus falsi {3} sint ex inferno, ac (o)quod sint infernum apud hominem, patet, quia 
sunt opposita intellectui (o)veri et voluntati (o)boni, quae sunt ex caelo a Domino, et sic quae faciunt caelum apud hominem. @1 Divinum Bonum, nam erat repraesentativum Divini Humani Domini quoad Divinum 
Bonum$ @2 voluntatis et fides falsi intellectus$ @3 haec voluntas et hic intellectus$ </p>
