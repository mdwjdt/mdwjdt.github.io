<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10503节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10503</strong>.“为自己造了金的神明”表并且他们培养一种地狱的快乐。这从“为自己造神明”和“金”的含义清楚可知：“为自己造神明”是指敬拜；“金”是指外在的爱之快乐，因而是指地狱的快乐（参看<a href="10402.htm">10402</a>节）。圣言提到四种偶像，即用石头所造的偶像，用木头所造的偶像，用银子所造的偶像和用金子所造的偶像。石头偶像表示由包含在教义中的虚假构成的一种崇拜，木头偶像表示由包含在教义中的邪恶构成的一种崇拜，银偶像表示教义和生活上的虚假的崇拜，金偶像表示教义和生活上的邪恶的崇拜。因此，金偶像表示最坏的崇拜。那些进行这种崇拜的人不仅歪曲真理，还玷污良善；因为他们称邪恶为良善，称由此产生的虚假为真理。所有被自我之爱主宰，却又相信圣言的人都进行这种崇拜；因为他们利用圣言的字义来支持他们所想所做的一切，从而支持对他们自己的崇拜或敬拜。</p>

And have made them gods of gold. That this signifies, and they worship infernal delight, is evident from the signification of "making them gods" as being worship; and from the signification of "gold," 
as being the delight of external loves, thus infernal delight (see above, n. 10402). Mention is made in the Word of four kinds of idols, namely, idols of stone, of wood, of silver, and of gold. Idols 
of stone signify worship from falsities of doctrine; those of wood signify worship from evils of doctrine; those of silver signify worship of falsity both in doctrine and in life; and those of gold 
signify worship of evil both in doctrine and in life. Consequently idols of gold signified worship the worst of all. They who were in this worship not only falsified truths, but also adulterated goods; 
for evils they called goods, and the derivative falsities they called truths. All those are in such worship who are in the love of self and yet believe the Word, for they apply the sense of the letter 
of the Word in favor of all the things which they think and do, thus in favor of the worship of self. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10503</b></p><p><b>10503.</b>
'And they have made gods of gold for themselves' means, and they cultivate a hellish delight. This is clear from the meaning of 'making gods for themselves' as cultivating; and from the meaning of 'gold' 
as delight belonging to external kinds of love, thus delight that is hellish, dealt with above in <a href="10402.htm">10402</a>. Four kinds of idols are mentioned in the Word - those made of stone, those made of wood, those 
made of silver, and those made of gold. Idols made of stone served to mean a cult consisting of falsities contained in religious teachings, and those made of wood a cult consisting of evils contained 
in them; idols made of silver served to mean the cult of what was false in both teachings and life, and those made of gold the cult of what was evil in both. Consequently idols made of gold served 
to mean the worst cult of all. Those who practised it not only falsified truths but also adulterated forms of good; for they called evils forms of good, and resulting falsities truths. All people who 
are ruled by self-love and nevertheless believe the Word practise this cult; for they use the literal sense of the Word to lend support to everything they think and do, thus to the cult or worship of 
themselves.  </p>

`Et fecerunt sibi deos auri': quod significet et colant jucundum infernale, constat ex significatione `facere sibi deos' quod sit cultus, et ex significatione `auri' quod sit jucundum amorum externorum, 
ita jucundum infernale, de qua supra n. 10,402.  Memorantur in Verbo quattuor genera idolorum, nempe ex lapide, ex ligno, ex argento, et ex auro; (o)idola quae ex lapide significabant {1} cultum 
ex falsis doctrinae, quae ex ligno cultum ex malis doctrinae, quae ex argento cultum falsi tam doctrina quam vita, et quae ex auro cultum mali tam doctrina quam vita; inde idola ex auro significabant 
cultum omnium pessimum; {2} qui in hoc cultu erant, non modo falsificabant vera sed etiam adulterabant bona, mala enim vocabant bona, ac inde falsa vera; omnes illi in eo cultu sunt qui in amore sui sunt 
et usque Verbum credunt, applicant enim sensum litterae Verbi ad favorem omnium quae cogitant et quae faciunt, ita ad cultum sui. @1 significant IT$ @2 i nam$ </p>
