And there shall be six branches going out of its sides, three branches of the lampstand out of one side of it, and three branches of the lampstand out of the other side of it. There shall be three almond-shaped 
cups on one branch, a pomegranate and a flower, and three almond-shaped cups on one branch,<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> a pomegranate and a flower - thus for the six branches going out of the lampstand. And on [the 
shaft of] the lampstand there shall be four almond-shaped cups, its pomegranates and its flowers. And there shall be a pomegranate under [the first] two branches out of it, and a pomegranate under [the 
second] two branches out of it, and a pomegranate under [the third] two branches out of it - for the six branches going out of the lampstand. Their pomegranates and their branches shall be of one piece 
with it,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> all [shall be part] of it - one solid [piece made] from pure gold.

'From pure gold' means that it must spring from celestial good. 'Solid shall the lampstand be made' means that all of it must spring from good. 'Its shaft and its branch, its cups' means the spiritual 
entities within the natural. 'Its pomegranates' means factual knowledge of good. 'And its flowers' means factual knowledge of truth. 'Shall be of one piece with it' means that both must form part 
of the spiritual springing from celestial good. 'And there shall be six branches going out of its sides' means all the capacities of truth derived from good in their entirety. 'Three branches of the 
lampstand out of one side of it, and three branches of the lampstand out of the other side of it' means completeness so far as good and truth are concerned. 'There shall be three almond-shaped cups' means 
completeness so far as factual knowledge derived from good is concerned. 'On one branch' means the power of truth derived from good. 'A pomegranate and a flower' means a known fact about good and 
a known fact about truth. 'And three almond-shaped cups on one branch, a pomegranate and a flower' has the same meaning. 'Thus for the six branches going out of the lampstand' means the power of truth

comes from the Lord. 'One solid [piece made] from pure gold' means unblemished and perfect because it all consists of the same good. 'And you shall make its seven lamps' means the holy spiritual things 
from it. 'And let it cause its lamps to go up' means the light of the spiritual heaven. 'And give light before its faces' means from the Divine Good of the Lord's Divine Human. 'And its tongs and 
its trowels' means things in the natural that serve to purify and clean out. '[Shall be made] from pure gold' means that these too must consist of good. 'A talent of pure gold shall [be used to] make
