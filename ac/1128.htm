<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1128节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1128.</strong>有一个人出现了，好象笼罩在云层中，脸上有许多游荡的星星，这些星星表示虚假。我被告知，当古教会开始灭亡时，其后代就是这样，尤其那些通过祭祀和图像敬拜的人。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1128.</strong> I saw someone wreathed in a kind of cloud, on whose face were quite a few wandering stars,{*1} which symbolize falsities. It was said that this was what the descendants of the ancient church were like when it started to die out, especially among those who established a cult involving the use of sacrifices and images.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} See <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1128/bible_king-james-version_jude_1_13" target=_top>Jude 1:13</a>, in which certain evil people are compared to wandering stars.

There appeared one veiled over as with a cloud, about whose face were many wandering stars, which signify falsities. I was told that such were the posterity of the Ancient Church when it began to perish, 
especially among those who instituted worship by sacrifices, and by images. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1128</b></p><p><b>1128.</b>
A certain person appeared who was enveloped so to speak with a cloud. On his face were many stars wandering around, which mean falsities. It was said that the descendants of the Ancient Church were such 
when it started to perish, especially among those who established worship by means of sacrifices and images. </p>

</p><b>1128.</b>
Visus est quidam obvelatus quasi nube, in cujus facie plures stellae errantes, quae significant falsitates; dicebatur quod talis fuerit posteritas Antiquae Ecclesiae cum perire inciperet, cumprimis 
apud eos qui cultum instituebant per sacrificia et per imagines. </p>
