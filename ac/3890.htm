<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3890节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3890.</strong>前面已频繁说明，天堂或大人被分为无数社群，并且总体上和身体内的器官并脏腑一样多；每个具体社群都属于这些器官和脏腑中的一个（参看<a href="3745.htm">3745</a>节）。还说明，这些社群虽然数不清，并且各种各样，但仍行如一体；就像身体内的一切事物尽管各种各样，但仍行如一体一样。属于心脏区域的天堂社群是属天社群，位于中间或至内层。而属于肺脏区域的天堂社群是属灵社群，在周边或外层。从主而来的流注经由属天社群进入属灵社群，或经由中间进入周边，即经由至内层进入外层。这是因为主经由爱和仁慈流入，这是其国度中一切属天之物的源头。祂经由爱和仁慈流入信之良善，这是其国度中一切属灵之物的源头。所有这一切还有一种无法言传的多样性，不过，这种多样性不是由流注，而是由接受产生的。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3890</b></p><p><b>3890.</b>
It has been occasionally observed above that heaven or the Grand Man is distinguished into innumerable societies, and in general into as many as there are organs and viscera in the body; and that each 
particular society belongs to one of these organs and viscera (see n. 3745). Also that the societies, although innumerable and various, nevertheless act as a one; just as all things in the body, although 
these are various, act as a one. The heavenly societies that belong to the province of the heart are the celestial societies, and are in the midst, or in the inmosts; but those which belong to the 
province of the lungs are the spiritual societies, and are round about, and are in the exteriors. The influx from the Lord is through the celestial societies into the spiritual ones, or through the 
middle into the circumferences, that is, through inmosts to exteriors. The reason of this is that the Lord inflows through love or mercy, whence comes all that is celestial in His kingdom; and through 
love or mercy He inflows into the good of faith, whence comes all that is spiritual in His kingdom; and this with unspeakable variety; but the variety does not arise from the influx, but from the reception. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3890</b></p><p><b>3890.</b>
It has been stated frequently already that heaven or the Grand Man is distinguished into countless separate communities, and into as many broad divisions as there are organs and viscera in the body; 
and that each individual community belongs to one of those broad divisions, <a href="3745.htm">3745</a>. It has also been stated that, though countless and varying, communities nevertheless act as one, just as all things within 
the body, though varying, act as one. The communities in heaven which belong to the province of the heart are celestial communities and are situated in the middle or the inmost parts. But the communities 
in heaven which belong to the province of the lungs are spiritual and are situated round about or more externally. Influx from the Lord passes by way of the celestial communities into the spiritual 
ones or from the middle into what is surrounding; that is, it flows from inmost parts to more external. The reason for this is that the Lord flows in by way of love or mercy, and this is the source 
of everything celestial in His kingdom. And by way of love and mercy He flows into the good of faith, and this is the source of everything spiritual in His kingdom. There is also an indescribable 
variety to all this, but that variety is not a product of the influx but of the reception of it. </p>

Prius aliquoties dictum est quod caelum seu Maximus Homo in innumerabiles societates distinctum sit, et in genere in totidem quot sunt organa et viscera in corpore, et quod singulae societates ad 
unum illorum pertineant, n. 3745; tum quod societates, tametsi innumerabiles sunt et variae, usque unum agant, sicut omnia quae in corpore {1}, tametsi varia sunt unum, societates quae inibi {2} ad cordis 
provinciam pertinent, caelestes societates sunt, et sunt in medio seu in intimis; quae autem ad pulmonum provinciam inibi pertinent, spirituales sunt, et sunt circumcirca et in exterioribus; 
influxus a Domino est per caelestes in spirituales, seu per mediam in circuitus, hoc est, per intima ad exteriora; hoc inde est quia Dominus per amorem seu misericordiam influit {3}, inde omne caeleste 
quod in regno Ipsius, et per amorem seu misericordiam in bonum fidei, inde omne spirituale quod in regno Ipsius, et hoc cum ineffabili varietate, sed varietas non existit ex influxu, sed e 
receptione. @1 homine$ @2 A d inibi, i in unoquovis$ </p>
