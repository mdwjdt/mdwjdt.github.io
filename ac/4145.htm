<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4145节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4145.</strong>“既然渴想你的父家”表渴望与直接流入的神性良善结合。这从“父家”的含义清楚可知。“父家”（即以撒和亚伯拉罕的家）是指直接流入的良善。“家”（house）表示良善（参看<a href="2233.htm">2233</a>，<a href="2234.htm">2234</a>，<a href="3652.htm">3652</a>，<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>节）；“父”也表示良善（<a href="3703.htm">3703</a>节）；“以撒”表示理性层的良善（参看<a href="3012.htm">3012</a>，<a href="3194.htm">3194</a>，<a href="3210.htm">3210</a>节）。另外，亚伯拉罕和以撒一起代表流入的神性良善，拉班表示旁系良善（Collateral good），或非直接流入的良善（参看<a href="3665.htm">3665</a>，<a href="3778.htm">3778</a>节）。旁系良善或非直接流入的良善是指被称为居间或中间良善的良善，因为该良善从看似良善，却并非良善的世俗事物那里获取了许多事物；而直接流入的良善则直接出自主，或从主经由天堂而来，是脱离了刚才所提到的那类世俗良善的神性良善。<br />凡正在重生的人首先处于居间或中间良善，以便该良善能服务于引入纯正的良善与真理；不过，一旦提供了这种功用，它就被分离出去；此人便被引向更直接流入的良善。因此，正在重生的人就逐渐被完善。例如，正在重生的人一开始都以为他所思所行的良善来自他自己，应得到某种回报；因为他还不知道，或即使知道也不理解，良善能从其它某个源头流入。他也不知道或理解除了他应得到回报之外还有什么其它的可能性，因为他凭自己行了善事。他若一开始不这样想，就永远不会行任何善事。但以这种方式，他不仅被引入对行善的情感，还被引入对良善，以及功德的认知。一旦以这种方式被引入对行善的情感，他就开始以不同的方式思考和相信；也就是说，他开始思考和相信，良善从主流入，他凭出于小我所行的良善不配得到任何东西；最终当真正的情感藏在他的意愿和行善后面时，他就会完全弃绝功德，甚至憎恶它，并被为了良善而对良善的情感所打动。当抵达这种状态时，良善就会直接流入。<br />再以婚姻之爱为例。首先到来并引入的良善外表好看，或举止良好，或表面相容，或条件相当，或是一种理想状态。这些良善是婚姻之爱最初的居间或中间良善。此后心智的结合便到来，在这种结合中，一方如对方那样去意愿，并以取悦对方为乐。这是第二个状态；然后之前的良善虽仍旧存在，但不再被关注。最后到来的是涉及属天良善和属灵真理的合一。也就是说，一方如对方那样去相信，并且一方如对方那样被对良善的情感所打动。当这种状态到来时，双方便一起体验天上的婚姻，也就是良善与真理的婚姻，从而体验婚姻之爱，因为婚姻之爱并非别的。与此同时，主流入这二者的情感，如同流入一个单一情感。这就是直接流入的良善；而之前间接流入的良善则充当引入该良善的手段。</p>

Because longing thou hast longed toward thy father's house. That this signifies a longing for conjunction with Divine good that flows in directly, is evident from the signification here of "father's 
house" (that is, the house of Isaac and Abraham), as being the good that inflows directly. (That "house" denotes good, see above, n. 2233, 2234, 3652, 3720; that "father" also denotes good, n. 3703; that 
"Isaac" is the good of the rational, see n. 3012, 3194, 3210.) and besides, Abraham together with Isaac represents the Divine good that inflows directly, and Laban collateral good, or that which does 
not inflow directly (see n. 3665, 3778). Collateral good, or that which does not inflow directly, is that good which has been called mediate good, for this good derives many things from worldly things 
which appear as goods, but are not goods; while the good that flows in directly is that which comes immediately from the Lord, or from the Lord mediately through heaven, and is Divine good separated 
from such worldly good as just referred to.  [2] Every man who is being regenerated is first in mediate good, in order that it may serve for introducing genuine goods and truths; but after it has 
served this use, this good is separated, and the man is brought to good which flows in more directly. Thus the man who is being regenerated is perfected by degrees. For example: he who is being regenerated 
believes at first that the good which he thinks and does is from himself, and that he also merits something; for he does not yet know, and if he knows he does not comprehend, that good can flow 
in from some other source, nor that it can be otherwise than that he should be recompensed, because he does it from himself. Unless at first he believed this, he would never do any good. But by this 
means he is initiated not only into the affection of doing what is good, but also into knowledges concerning good and also concerning merit; and when in this manner he has been led into the affection 
of doing what is good, he then begins to think differently and to believe differently, namely, that good flows in from the Lord, and that by the good which he does from his own he merits nothing; and 
at last when he is in the affection of willing and doing what is good, he altogether rejects self-merit, and even has an aversion for it, and is affected with good from good. When he is in this state, 
good flows in directly. [3] Take also as an example conjugial love: the good which precedes and initiates is beauty, or agreement of manners, or an outward adaptation of the one to the other, or equality 
of condition, or a desired condition. These goods are the first mediate goods of conjugial love. Afterwards comes conjunction of minds, wherein the one wills as the other, and perceives delight 
in doing that which pleases the other. This is the second state; and then the former things, though still present, are no longer regarded. Finally there follows a unition in respect to celestial good 
and spiritual truth, in that the one believes as the other, and the one is affected by the same good as the other. When this state comes, both are together in the heavenly marriage, which is that of good 
and truth, and thus are in conjugial love-for conjugial love is nothing else-and the Lord then flows into the affections of both as into one affection. This is the good that flows directly; but 
the former goods, which flowed in indirectly, served as means of introduction to this. </p>

'Because you longed greatly for your father's house' means a longing to be joined to Divine good flowing in down a direct line. This is clear from the meaning here of 'father's house' - that is, Isaac 
and Abraham's house - as good flowing in along the direct line of descent. For 'house' means good, see <a href="2233.htm">2233</a>, <a href="2234.htm">2234</a>, <a href="3652.htm">3652</a>, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>; 'father' too means good, <a href="3703.htm">3703</a>; 'Isaac' means the good of the Rational, <a href="3012.htm">3012</a>, <a href="3194.htm">3194</a>, <a href="3210.htm">3210</a>. In addition to this 'Abraham together with Isaac' represents Divine good flowing along the direct line of descent, and 'Laban' parallel good or good which does not flow in along the 
direct line, <a href="3665.htm">3665</a>, <a href="3778.htm">3778</a>. Parallel good or that which does not flow in along the direct line is the good which has been called intermediate good, for this good derives very much from things that are worldly 
which seem to be good but are not. Good flowing in along the direct line comes immediately from the Lord or else from the Lord by way of heaven as an intermediary; it is also Divine good separated 
from the kind of worldly good just mentioned. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 With everyone who is being regenerated good is at first intermediate good, for the purpose that it may serve in the introduction of genuine goods 
and truths. But once it has served that use it is separated; and that person is guided towards good which flows in along the direct line of descent. So a person who is being regenerated is perfected 
gradually. For example: a person who is being regenerated believes at first that the good which he thinks and which he does begins in himself, and also that he earns some reward, for he does not yet 
know, or if he does know does not comprehend, that good is able to flow in from some other source. Neither does he know of or comprehend any other possibility than that he should be rewarded because he 
does it of himself. If he did not believe this at first he would never do anything good. But by this means he is introduced not only into the affection for doing good but also into cognitions concerning 
good and also concerning merit. And once he has been guided in this way into the affection for doing good he starts to think differently and to believe differently. That is to say, he starts to think 
and to believe that good flows in from the Lord and that he merits nothing through good which he does from the proprium. And when at length true affection lies behind his willing and doing of what 
is good he rejects merit altogether and indeed loathes it, and he is moved by an affection for good for the sake of what is good. When this state is reached good is flowing in down a direct line. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
Take as another example conjugial love. The good which comes first and is introductory is good looks, or good manners, or outward compatibility, or similarity of social class, or aspiration. These 
forms of good are the first intermediate ones of conjugial love. After this comes the joining together of minds (animus) in which one wills as the other does and finds delight in doing that which is 
pleasing to the other. This is the second state, and although those initial forms of good are still present they are no longer kept in view. Finally there follows a uniting involving celestial good and 
spiritual truth. That is to say, one believes as the other believes, and one is moved by an affection for good as the other is moved. When this state is reached both together experience the heavenly 
marriage, which is a marriage of good and truth, and so experience conjugial love since conjugial love is nothing else. At the same time the Lord is flowing into the affections of them both as into 
a single affection. This is a good which flows in down a direct line, whereas the previous kind of good which had flowed in down an indirect line had served as the means of introduction to this good. </p>

`Quia desiderando desideravisti ad domum patris tui': quod significet desiderium conjunctionis cum bono Divino directe influente, constat ex significatione `domus patris' hic, hoc est, Jishaki et 
Abrahami, quod sit bonum directe influens; quod `domus' sit bonum, videatur n. 2233, 2234, (x)3652, 3720; quod etiam `pater' sit bonum, n. 3703; quod `Jishakus' sit bonum Rationalis, n. 3012, 3194, 
3210; et praeterea `Abraham cum Jishako' repraesentat bonum Divinum directe influens, et `Laban' bonum collaterale seu quod non directe influit, n. 3665, 3778: bonum collaterale seu quod non directe 
influit, est id bonum quod bonum medium dictum est, nam trahit hoc bonum plurima ex mundanis quae apparent ut bona sed non sunt bona; at bonum directe influens est quod immediate a Domino, aut 
mediate {1} per caelum a Domino, (x)estque bonum Divinum separatum a bono mundano tali ut modo dictum: [2] unusquisque homo qui regeneratur, primum in bono medio est, ex causa ut inserviat hoc pro 
introducendis bonis et veris genuinis, at postquam hoc inserviverat illi usui, separatur, et perducitur ad bonum quod directius influit; ita `homo qui regeneratur', per gradus perficitur; ut pro exemplo: 
qui regeneratur, primum credit quod bonum quod cogitat et quod facit sit {2} a seipso, et quoque quod aliquid mereatur, nondum enim scit, (o)et si scit non capit, quod bonum possit aliunde influere, nec 
quod possit quin retribuatur quia ex seipso id facit; nisi hoc primum crederet, nusquam faceret bonum; sed initiatur per id, tam in affectionem faciendi bonum quam in cognitiones de bono 
et quoque de merito; cumque in affectionem faciendi bonum ita perductus est, tunc incipit aliud cogitare et aliud credere, nempe quod bonum influat a Domino et quod per bonum quod ex proprio facit, 
nihil mereatur et tandem cum est in affectione volendi et faciendi bonum, tunc prorsus rejicit meritum, immo aversatur, et afficitur bono ex bono; cum in hoc statu est, tunc bonum directe influit. 
`Sit quoque pro exemplo amor conjugialis: [3] bonum quod praecedit et initiat, est pulchritudo, aut convenientia morum, aut applicatio externa unius versus alterum, aut conditio utrinque par, (o)aut 
conditio desiderata; haec bona sunt bona media prima amoris conjugialis; </p>
<p>postmodum venit conjunctio animorum, quod unus velit sicut alter, et jucundum percipiat in faciendo quod alteri placet; 
hic status est alter et tunc priora tametsi adsunt, usque non spectantur; </p>
<p>demum succedit unitio quoad bonum caeleste et verum spirituale, quod nempe unus credat sicut alter, (o)et unus afficiatur 
bono quo alter; cum hic status est, tunc uterque simul est in conjugio caelesti quod est boni et veri, ita in amore conjugiali, nam amor conjugialis non aliud est, et tunc Dominus influit in affectiones utriusque 
sicut in unam; hoc bonum est quod directe influit, priora autem quae indirecte influxerunt, inserviverant pro mediis introducendi ad hoc.      @1 i quod$      @2 fit I$ </p>
