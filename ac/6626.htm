<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6626节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6626.</strong>让我来讲述一些奇事。唯独主是人，天使、灵人和地上的居民由于主而被称为人。祂通过自己进入天堂的流注而使得整个天堂呈现并类似一个人；通过既经由天堂，又直接从祂自己进入那里的每个个体的流注，祂使得每一个看上去都是一个人，使天使看上去在一个比任何人所能描述的还要美丽、光彩的形式中。祂也通过流入世人的灵而为世人如此行。事实上，对一位天使、一个灵人和一个活在对邻之仁和对主之爱的世人来说，其思维的所有最小事物都类似一个人，因为这仁和这爱都源于主，凡源于主之物都类似一个人。此外，正是这些品质构成一个人。而地狱正好相反，因为那里的人都陷入仁爱和属天堂之爱的对立面。诚然，在他们自己的光中，他们看上去像人；但在天堂之光中，却看似可怕的怪物；其中一些人身上几乎看不出任何人形之物。原因在于，主经由天堂的流注不被接受，而是要么被弃绝，要么被窒息或扼杀，要么被扭曲，由此使得他们看似这类怪物。其思维，或观念的最小事物同样具有这类形式；因为人整体上是什么样，部分上也是什么样。这些人所显现的形式也是他们所在地狱的形式。因为每个地狱都有自己的形式，在天堂之光中，该形式类似一个怪物；看见通过这光显现的这些人当中的任何一个，就能凭他的形式认出他所来自的地狱。我曾在通向灵人界的大门处看见过他们，他们在那里看似各种不同的怪物。关于地狱之门通向灵人界，可参看前文（<a href="5852.htm">5852</a>节）。（第八卷结束）</p>

I will relate some wonderful things. The Lord, who alone is Man, and from whom angels, spirits, and the inhabitants of earth are called men, does Himself, by His influx into heaven cause the universal 
heaven to represent and bear relation to a man, and by influx through heaven and from Himself immediately into the individuals there, cause each one to appear as a man, the angels in a more beautiful 
and resplendent form than can be described; and in like manner by His influx into the spirit of man. Nay, with an angel, a spirit, and a man who lives in charity toward the neighbor and in love to the 
Lord, the very smallest things of thought bear relation to a man, for the reason that this charity and this love are from the Lord, and whatever is from the Lord bears relation to a man. Moreover it 
is these things that make man. On the other hand, in hell, because they who are there are in things contrary to charity and celestial love, in their own light they do indeed appear like men, but in 
the light of heaven as dreadful monsters, in some of whom scarcely anything of the human form is recognizable. The reason is that the Lord's influx through heaven is not received, but is either rejected, 
or extinguished, or perverted, causing them to have such an appearance. They are in like manner such forms in the smallest things of their thought or in their ideas; for such as anyone is in the whole, 
such he is in part; these being analogous and homogeneous. That form in which they appear is also the form of the hell in which they are; for every hell has its own form, which in the light of heaven 
is like a monster; and those of them who appear from this light show by their form from what hell they are. They have appeared to me at the gates which opened into the world of spirits, and they 
were seen as monsters, with much variety. That the gates of hell open into the world of spirits may be seen above (n. 5852). </p>

Let me recount some marvels. The Lord alone is Man, and it is owing to Him that angels, spirits, and inhabitants of the world are called men. By His own flowing into heaven He causes the whole of heaven 
to represent and resemble one human being; and through an influx both by way of heaven and directly from Himself into each individual there He causes all to be seen as men, and angels to be seen in 
a form more beautiful and dazzling than anyone can possibly describe. He does the same for people on earth by flowing into their spirits. Indeed with an angel, spirit, or man who leads a life of charity 
towards the neighbour and love to the Lord the smallest aspects of all that belong to his thought resemble a human being, for the reason that that charity and that love originate in the Lord, and 
whatever originates in the Lord resembles a human being. Those qualities are also what constitute a human being. But the contrary applies in hell, because those who are there are fired by the opposites 
of charity and heavenly love. They do, it is true, look like human beings when seen in their own inferior light, but in the superior light of heaven they look like horrible monsters, in some of whom 
scarcely anything of the human form is recognizable. The reason for this is that the inflow of the Lord by way of heaven is not accepted but is turned away, or smothered, or perverted, which therefore 
causes them to be seen as such monsters. And the smallest aspects of their thought, that is, their ideas, similarly possess forms such as these; for what anyone is like as a whole, so he is in part, 
since the whole and the part are the same in type and nature. The form in which those people are seen is also the form of the hell in which they exist. For every hell has its own form, which in the 
light of heaven resembles a monster; and when one sees any of those who are from it one recognizes from their form which hell they are from. I have seen them in the gates that lie open into the world 
of spirits, where they looked like many different kinds of monsters. Regarding the gates of hell, that they lie open into the world of spirits, see <a href="5852.htm">5852</a>.

Mirabilia referam:  Dominus Qui (t)solus est Homo, ex Quo angeli, spiritus et incolae telluris, homines vocantur {1}; {2}Ipse per influxum Suum in caelum facit ut universum caelum repraesentet et referat 
unum hominem, et per influxum per caelum et a Se immediate in singulos ibi facit ut unusquisque appareat ut homo, angeli in pulchriore et splendidiore forma quam ut describi queat; similiter per 
influxum in spiritum hominis; immo apud angelum, spiritum et hominem, qui in charitate erga proximum et in amore in Dominum vivit, omnium minima cogitationis referunt hominem, ex causa quia charitas 
illa et amor ille est a Domino, et quicquid a Domino est, hoc refert hominem; illa etiam sunt quae faciunt hominem.  Vice versa autem in inferno, quia illi qui ibi, in contrariis charitati et amori caelesti 
sunt, in suo lumine quidem apparent sicut homines, at in luce caeli sicut monstra horrenda in quorum quibusdam vix aliquid humanae formae cognoscitur; causa est quia influxus Domini per caelum 
non recipitur, sed rejicitur, vel exstinguitur, vel pervertitur, unde tales apparent; similiter in minimis eorum cogitationis, seu in ideis, tales formae sunt, nam qualis quis est in toto, talis est in 
parte, sunt enim analoga et homogenea; illa forma in qua apparent, est etiam forma inferni in quo sunt; quodlibet enim infernum habet suam formam quae in luce caeli est instar monstri, et qui eorum 
inde apparent, dignoscuntur ex forma e quo inferno sunt; apparuerunt mihi in portis, quae patuerunt in mundum spirituum, et visi sunt sicut monstra multa varietate; quod portae inferni in mundum spirituum 
pateant, videatur n. 5852. @1 i et apparent homines$ @2 Dominus$ FINIS LIBRI GENESEOS
