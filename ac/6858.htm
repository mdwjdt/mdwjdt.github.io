<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6858节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6858.</strong>“就是到迦南人、赫人的地方”表由虚假产生的邪恶所占据的区域。这从“迦南人”和“赫人”的代表清楚可知：“迦南人”是指由邪恶的虚假所产生的邪恶（参看<a href="4818.htm">4818</a>节）；“赫人”是指邪恶所来自的虚假（<a href="2913.htm">2913</a>节）。此处和别处（如创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创15.18.htm">15:18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创15.19.htm">19</a>；出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出23.23.htm">23:23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出23.28.htm">28</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出33.2.htm">33:2</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.11.htm">34:11</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.1.htm">7:1</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申20.17.htm">20:17</a>；约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书3.10.htm">3:10</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/书24.11.htm">24:11</a>；士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士3.5.htm">3:5</a>）所列举的迦南地的各个民族表示各种各样的邪恶和虚假。有必要说明一下何谓由虚假产生的邪恶所占据的区域，以及其它各种各样的邪恶和虚假。在主降世之前，邪恶的魔鬼和灵人占据了那些属灵人后来被提入的整个天堂区域。因为在主降临之前，这类人当中有很大一部分人正在鬼鬼祟祟地四处走动，侵扰善人，尤其侵扰在低地的属灵人。但主降临之后，他们都被推下自己的地狱，那片区域就得以释放，作为一个产业被交与那些属于属灵教会的人。我经常发现，某个地方一旦被善灵遗弃，就会被恶灵占据；但恶灵会从那里被赶出去；一旦他们被赶出去，它就会再次被交与那些处于良善的人。原因在于，从地狱来的人有一种不断燃烧的欲望，想要毁灭天堂事物，尤其毁灭他们所反对的那些事物。因此，当某个地方被遗弃时，由于那时没有保护，所以它立刻被恶人占据。如前所述，这一切是邪恶和虚假所占据的区域尤其所指的意思，这个区域由将要被赶出去的各个民族所在的地方来表示。这一切，连同前面所述（<a href="6854.htm">6854</a>节）是一个很深的大奥秘，没有启示是不可能知道的。</p>

Unto the place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite. That this signifies the region occupied by evils from falsities, is evident from the representation of the Canaanites, as being evils from the falsities 
of evil (see n. 4818); and from the representation of the Hittites, as being falsities from which are evils (n. 2913). (By the nations in the land of Canaan which are enumerated here and also in other 
places, as Gen. 15:18, 19; Exod. 23:23, 28; 33:2; 34:11; Deut. 7:1; 20:17; Josh. 3:10; 24:11; Judges 3:5, are signified all kinds of evil and falsity.) What is meant by the region occupied by evils 
from falsities, and also by the other kinds of evil and falsity, must be told. Before the coming of the Lord into the world, evil genii and spirits occupied all that region of heaven to which the spiritual 
were afterward taken up; for before the coming of the Lord many such roamed at large and infested the good, especially the spiritual who were in the lower earth; but after the coming of the Lord 
they were all thrust down into their hells, and that region was set free, and was given for an inheritance to those who were of the spiritual church. It has been frequently observed that as soon as 
any place is left by good spirits it is occupied by evil ones; and that the evil are driven out of it, and as soon as this is done it again passes to those who are in good. The reason is that the infernals 
continually burn to destroy the things of heaven, especially those to which they are in opposition; and therefore when any place is left, being then without protection, it is immediately occupied 
by the evil. As before said, this is especially meant by the region occupied by evils and falsities, which is signified by the place where the nations were that were to be driven out. This, together 
with what was said above (n. 6854) is a great mystery, which cannot be known without being revealed. </p>

'To the place of the Canaanite and the Hittite' means the region occupied by evils that arise from falsities. This is clear from the representation of 'the Canaanites' as evils that arise from the falsities 
of evil, dealt with in <a href="4818.htm">4818</a>; and from the representation of 'the Hittites' as falsities from which evils arise, dealt with in <a href="2913.htm">2913</a>. By the nations in the land of Canaan that are listed here as 
well as in other places, such as <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2015:18,19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 15:18,19</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2023:23,%2028;%2033:2;%2034:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 23:23, 28; 33:2; 34:11</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%207:1;%2020:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 7:1; 20:17</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%203:10;%2024:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 3:10; 24:11</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%203:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 3:5</a>, are meant all kinds of evil and falsity. What one should understand by a 
region occupied by evils that arise from falsities, and also by all the other kinds of evil and falsity, must be stated. Before the Lord's Coming into the world evil genii and spirits occupied the entire 
region of heaven to which those who were spiritual were subsequently raised. For before the Lord's Coming a large part of those kinds of beings were freely prowling about and molesting the good, especially 
spiritual people who were on the lower earth. But after the Lord's Coming they were all thrust down into their own hells, and that region was liberated and given as an inheritance to those who 
belonged to the spiritual Church. I have often noticed that as soon any place is abandoned by good spirits it is occupied by evil ones, but that the evil spirits are driven out of it; and that once 
they have been driven out it is handed over again to those who are governed by good. The reason for this is that those from hell have a constant burning desire to destroy the things of heaven, in particular 
those things that are their opposites. Consequently when some place is abandoned, then because it is unprotected it is instantly occupied by the evil. This, as has been stated, is what one should 
understand specifically by a region occupied by evils and falsities, which is meant by the place inhabited by the nations who were to be driven out. This together with the things mentioned above in <a href="6854.htm">6854</a> is a deep mystery which cannot be known about without revelation. </p>

`Ad locum Cananaei et Chittaei': quod significet regionem occupatam a malis ex falsis, constat ex repraesentatione `Cananaeorum quod sint mala ex falsis mali, de qua n. 4818; et ex repraesentatione 
Chittaeorum quod sint falsa ex quibus mala, de qua n. 2913.  Per gentes in terra Canaane quae enumerantur hic et quoque alibi, ut Gen. xv 18, 19; Exod. xxiii 23, 28, xxxiii 2, xxxiv 11; Deut. vii I, xx 
17; Jos. iii 10, xxiv 11; Jud. iii 5, significantur omnia genera mali et falsi.  Quid per regionem occupatam a malis ex falsis, et quoque a reliquis generibus mali et falsi, intelligitur, dicendum: 
ante Adventum Domini in mundum mali genii et spiritus omnem illam regionem caeli occupabant ad quam postea elevati sunt spirituales; nam ante Adventum Domini multa pars talium libere grassabatur, et infestabat 
bonos, imprimis spirituales qui in inferiore terra; sed post Adventum Domini {1} omnes in sua inferna detrusi sunt, et regio illa liberata est, (c)ac in hereditatem data {2} illis qui ab Ecclesia 
spirituali; saepius {3} observatum est quod, ut primum aliquis locus a spiritibus bonis relinquitur, occupetur a malis, et quod mali inde expellantur, {4}quibus expulsis quod iterum cedat illis 
qui in bono; causa est quia infernales continue ardent destruere illa quae caeli sunt, in specie illa quibus in opposito sunt; quapropter cum locus alicubi relinquitur, quia tunc absque tutela, occupatur 
is ilico a malis.  Hoc intelligitur in specie, ut dictum, per regionem occupatam a malis et falsis, quae significatur per locum ubi gentes quae expellendae.  Hoc, una cum illis quae supra n. 6854, 
est mysterium magnum quod absque revelatione notum esse non potest. 	@1 i mali$ 	@2 i est$ 	@3 i enim$ 	@4 et$ </p>
