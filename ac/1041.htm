<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1041节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1041.</strong>“万代”表所有不断重新受造的人。这从“万代”的含义明显可知。“代”是来自在先之物的后代，如来自其父母的后代。“万”是不断延续之物。此处的主题是那些已重生之物，因此，“万代”用来表示那些正不断以这种方式重生之人，即正在重新受造的人。就内义而言，一切事物的含义皆取决于所论述的主题。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1041.</strong> To everlasting generations means all who are created anew, without end, as can be seen from the symbolism of everlasting generations. Generations are offspring that result from earlier events — their "parents." Everlasting means what has no end. The subject here is things that have been regenerated, so everlasting generations mean people who are constantly being reborn out of those things, that is, who are being created anew. (The inner meaning depends entirely on the topics under discussion.) </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1041</b></p><p><b>1041.</b>
For the generations of an age. That this signifies all perpetually who are being created anew, is evident from the signification of the "generations of an age." "Generations" are posterities which are 
from those which have preceded, as from their parents. "Of an age" is what is perpetual. The subject here is the things that have been regenerated, and therefore by the "generations of an age" are meant 
those who thereby are perpetually being regenerated, that is, who are being created anew. In the internal sense, all things bear a signification that is determined by what is being treated of. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1041</b></p><p><b>1041.</b>
'Into the generations of an age' means all unceasingly who are being created anew. This is clear from the meaning of 'generations of an age'. 'Generations' means descendants of those going before as 
their parents. 'An age' is that which continues unceasingly. Here the subject is those things that have been regenerated and therefore 'the generations of an age' is used to mean those people who are 
unceasingly being regenerated in this way, that is, who are being created anew. In the internal sense the meaning of everything is determined by the subject under discussion. </p>

</p><b>1041.</b>
'In generationes saeculi': quod significet perpetuo omnes qui e novo creantur, constat a significatione 'generationum saeculi'; 'generationes' sunt posteritates, quae a prioribus, ut a suis parentibus, 
sunt; 'saeculum' est perpetuum; hic agitur de illis quae regenerata sunt, quare per regenerationes saeculi intelliguntur illi qui inde perpetuo regenerantur, hoc est, qui e novo creantur; omnia in 
sensu interno se habent praedicate ad illa de quibus agitur. </p>
