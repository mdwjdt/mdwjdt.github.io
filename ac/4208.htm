<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4208节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4208.</strong>“雅各就指着他父亲以撒所敬畏的起誓”表出自神性人身的确认，在这种状态下，神性人身被称为“所敬畏的”。这从“起誓”和“以撒所敬畏的”的含义清楚可知：“起誓”是指确认（参看<a href="2842.htm">2842</a>，<a href="3375.htm">3375</a>节）；“以撒所敬畏的”是指主的神性人身（<a href="4180.htm">4180</a>节）。当人们起誓时，他们就是以主的神性人身之名起誓（参看<a href="2842.htm">2842</a>节）。<br />此处之所以说“亚伯拉罕的神，拿鹤的神，他们父亲（即他拉）的神”和“以撒（即雅各的父亲）所敬畏的”，是因为他拉的子孙承认众多神灵；事实上，他们是偶像崇拜者（<a href="1353.htm">1353</a>，<a href="1356.htm">1356</a>，<a href="1992.htm">1992</a>，<a href="3667.htm">3667</a>节）。那个家族的主要特征是，每个家庭敬拜自己的神明。这就是为何此处说“亚伯拉罕的神，拿鹤的神，他们父亲的神”和“以撒所敬畏的”原因。虽然亚伯拉罕的家人被命令承认耶和华为他们的神，然而他们承认祂，就如同承认用来将他们与外邦人区别开来的另一个神，只是祂的名字不同而已。正因如此，他们经常向别神俯伏下拜，这一点从圣言的历史部分可以看出来。这种纯名义上承认的原因在于，他们唯独处于外在事物，根本不知道何为内在事物，也不想知道。<br />就他们的关注点而言，其教会的宗教仪式纯粹是偶像崇拜，因为它们脱离了内在事物；事实上，当脱离内在事物时，教会的一切宗教仪式都是偶像崇拜。然而，这些人仍有可能代表教会的纯正之物，因为代表与进行代表的人无关，只与所代表的事物有关（<a href="665.htm">665</a>，<a href="1097.htm">1097</a>e，<a href="1361.htm">1361</a>，<a href="3147.htm">3147</a>节）。但为了一个代表性教会可以产生，并且以这种方式主与人通过天堂的某种交流可以存在，把他们保持在即便不是发自内心，仅仅口头上对耶和华的承认中尤为重要。因为他们当中的代表不是发自内在事物，而是发自外在事物。他们以这种方式与主交流；这与纯正教会截然不同，因为在纯正的教会，交流是通过内在事物实现的。因此，他们的神性敬拜对他们的灵魂根本没有任何影响，也就是说，并不能给予他们来世的祝福，只给予今世的繁华。<br />因此，为了把他们保持在这些外在事物中，他们当中才会有如此多的神迹发生；如果他们一直处于内在事物，这些神迹绝不会发生。由于同样的原因，他们还多次通过惩罚、被掳和威胁而被强迫敬拜耶和华；尽管主不会强迫任何人进行内在敬拜，因为内在敬拜只能在自由的状态下被植入（<a href="1937.htm">1937</a>，<a href="1947.htm">1947</a>，<a href="2874.htm">2874</a>-<a href="2881.htm">2881</a>，<a href="3145.htm">3145</a>，<a href="3146.htm">3146</a>，<a href="3158.htm">3158</a>，<a href="4031.htm">4031</a>节）。要求他们的主要外在做法是，他们要承认耶和华的名；因为耶和华就是主，在教会的一切事物中，所代表的都是主。耶和华就是主（参看<a href="1343.htm">1343</a>，<a href="1736.htm">1736</a>，<a href="2921.htm">2921</a>，<a href="3035.htm">3035</a>节）。</p>

And Jacob sware by the Dread of his father Isaac. That this signifies confirmation from the Divine Human, which in this state is called "the Dread," is evident from the signification of swearing," as 
being confirmation (see n. 2842, 3375) and from the signification of the "Dread of Isaac," as being the Lord's Divine Human (n. 4180). (That oaths were made in the name of the Lord's Divine Human may 
be seen above, n. 2842.) [2] The reason why it is here said, "the God of Abraham, the God of Nahor, the God of their father" (that is, of Terah) and "the Dread of Isaac," Jacob's father, is that the 
sons of Terah acknowledged this number of gods, for they were idolaters (n. 1353, 1356, 1992, 3667). And it was a peculiarity in that house that each family worshiped its own god. This is the reason 
why it is here said, "the God of Abraham, the God of Nahor, the God of their father, and the Dread of Isaac." Nevertheless it was enjoined upon the family of Abraham to acknowledge Jehovah as their God; 
and yet they did not acknowledge Him otherwise than as another god, by whom they might distinguish themselves from the Gentiles, thus they acknowledged Jehovah merely as to the name, and it was in 
consequence of this that they so often fell away to other gods, as may be seen from the historic parts of the Word. The reason of this merely nominal acknowledgment was that they were solely in externals, 
and what internal things were they knew not at all, and did not desire to know.  [3] Insofar as they were concerned the very rituals of their church were merely idolatrous, because they were separated 
from internal things; for when separated from its internal every ritual of the church is idolatrous. Nevertheless what is genuine of the church could be represented by them; for representations 
do not regard the person, but the thing (n. 665, 1097, 1361, 3147). Yet in order that a representative church might come into existence, and that there might thus be some communication of the Lord through 
heaven with man, it was of especial importance that they should be kept in the acknowledgment of Jehovah, if not in heart, still with the mouth; for with them the representatives did not issue from 
internal, but from external things; and it was in this way that they had communication with the Lord; quite otherwise than in the genuine church, in which the communication is effected by means of 
internal things. For this reason their Divine worship did not at all affect their souls, that is, did not make them blessed in the other life, but only prosperous in this world. [4] Therefore in order 
that they might be kept in these external things, there were so many miracles performed among them, which would never have taken place if they had been in internal things; and for this reason they 
were so many times driven to their worship by punishments, captivities, and threats; whereas no one is driven by the Lord to internal worship, but this is implanted through freedom (n. 1937, 1947, 2874-2881, 
3145, 3146, 3158, 4031). Their principal external was that they should confess Jehovah; for Jehovah was the Lord, who was represented in all things of that church. (That Jehovah was the Lord may 
be seen above, n. 1343, 1736, 2921, 3035.) </p>

'And Jacob swore by the Dread of his father Isaac' means confirmation from the Divine Human, which in that state is called 'the Dread'. This is clear from the meaning of 'swearing' as confirmation, dealt 
with in <a href="2842.htm">2842</a>, <a href="3375.htm">3375</a>; and from the meaning of 'the Dread of Isaac' as the Lord's Divine Human, dealt with in <a href="4180.htm">4180</a>. The fact that when people swore oaths they did so by the Lord's Divine Human, see <a href="2842.htm">2842</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason for the use here of the expressions 'the God of Abraham, the God of Nahor, the God of their father (who was Terah)' and 'the Dread of Isaac, Jacob's father' is that Terah's sons 
acknowledged just so many gods, for they were idolaters, <a href="1353.htm">1353</a>, <a href="1356.htm">1356</a>, <a href="1992.htm">1992</a>, <a href="3667.htm">3667</a>. It was also a peculiar feature of that house that each family worshipped its own individual god. This is why at this 
point the expressions 'the God of Abraham', 'the God of Nahor', 'the God of their father', and 'the Dread of Isaac' are used. Abraham's family however was commanded to acknowledge Jehovah as its God. 
All the same, they did not acknowledge Him to be anything more than just another god by whom they could distinguish themselves from the gentiles, and so only His name was different. This also accounts 
for their defection on so many occasions to other gods, as is made clear in the historical sections of the Word. The reason why they defected was that they were interested solely in things of an external 
nature. What things of an internal nature were they did not know at all and did not wish to know. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 So far as those people's participation in them was concerned, the religious practices of their 
Church were wholly idolatrous because they had been separated from the things of an internal nature; for every religious practice of the Church when separated from what is internal is idolatrous. 
Yet it was still possible for those people to represent the genuine condition of the Church since representations have nothing to do with the person who represents, only with the thing represented, <a href="665.htm">665</a>, 
<a href="1097.htm">1097</a> (end), <a href="1361.htm">1361</a>, <a href="3147.htm">3147</a>. But in order that a representative Church might come into being, and in this way some kind of communication between the Lord and man through heaven might exist, it was particularly 
necessary for them to be kept in their acknowledgement of Jehovah, if not in their hearts yet with their lips. For among them representatives were not an expression of internal entities but of 
external ones. And this was the kind of communication they had, different from that in the genuine Church in which communication was effected through things of an internal nature. For this reason also 
their Divine worship made no difference to their souls, that is, it did not yield them blessings in the next life, only prosperity in the world. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In order that they might be kept in external 
things so many miracles were therefore performed among them which would never have taken place if things of an internal nature had had a place among them. For the same reason they were also compelled 
on many occasions to worship Jehovah through the imposition of punishments, captivities, and threats, though no one is compelled by the Lord to engage in internal worship, for this is implanted only in 
a state of freedom, <a href="1937.htm">1937</a>, <a href="1947.htm">1947</a>, <a href="2874.htm">2874</a>-<a href="2881.htm">2881</a>, <a href="3145.htm">3145</a>, <a href="3146.htm">3146</a>, <a href="3158.htm">3158</a>, <a href="4031.htm">4031</a>. The chief external practice required of them was that they should confess the name Jehovah, for Jehovah was the Lord who was represented 
in all the practices of that Church. On the point that Jehovah was the Lord, see <a href="1343.htm">1343</a>, <a href="1736.htm">1736</a>, <a href="2921.htm">2921</a>, <a href="3035.htm">3035</a>. </p>

`Et juravit Jacob in Pavorem patris sui Jishaki': quod significet confirmationem a Divino Humano quod `Pavor' dicitur in illo statu, constat a significatione `jurare' quod sit confirmatio, de qua 
n. 2842, 3375; et ex significatione `pavoris Jishaki' quod sit Divinum Humanum Domini, de qua n. 4180; quod juramenta fierent per Divinum Humanum Domini, {1} n. 2842.  [2] Quod hic dicatur `Deus Abrahami, 
Deus Nahoris, Deus patris eorum' seu Terahi, et `Pavor Jishaki patris Jacobi' est quia filii Terahi totidem agnoscerent deos, fuerunt enim idololatrae, n. 1353, 1356, 1992, 3667; et peculiare 
fuit in illa domo quod unaquaevis familia suum deum coleret, inde hic dicitur Deus Abrahami, Deus Nahoris, Deus patris eorum, et pavor Jishaki; familiae tamen Abrahami injunctum fuit ut agnoscerent 
Jehovam pro suo Deo; sed usque Ipsum non agnoscebant aliter quam sicut alium deum per quem se distinguerent a gentibus, ita quoad solum nomen; quapropter etiam toties desciverunt ad alios deos, 
ut constare potest ab historicis Verbi; </p>
<p>causa fuit quia solum in externis erant; quid interna, prorsus non sciebant, nec {2} scire volebant; [3] ipsa ritualia Ecclesiae eorum respective ad illos 
non fuerunt aliter quam idololatrica, quia separata erant ab infernis, omne enim rituale Ecclesiae separatum ab interno est idololatricum; at usque potuit genuinum Ecclesiae per illos repraesentari, 
nam repraesentationes non spectant personam sed rem, n. 665, 1097 f., 1361, 3147; {3} verum ut repraesentativa Ecclesia existeret, et sic aliqua communicatio Domini per caelum cum homine, teneri 
debuerunt imprimis in eo ut agnoscerent Jehovam, si non corde usque ore; repraesentativa enim apud illos non exibant ab internis sed ab externis et sic se communicabant, aliter ac in Ecclesia genuina 
in qua per interna fit communicatio; quapropter etiam cultus eorum Divinus nihil animas (c)eorum affecit, hoc est, beatos fecit in altera vita, sed solum faustos in mundo: [4] ut itaque in externis 
tenerentur, ideo toties miracula apud illos, quae nusquam exstitissent si in internis fuissent; et ideo toties cogebantur per punitiones, per captivitates et per minas ad cultum, cum tamen nemo
