<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4073节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4073.</strong>“雅各就打发人，叫拉结和利亚到田野他的羊群那里去”表对真理的情感与现由“雅各”所表示的良善联结，这种联结是通过该良善本身实现的；以及当这良善离开时，这些情感被运用于的用途。这从“雅各”、“拉结和利亚”的代表清楚可知：“雅各”是指属世层的良善，如前面频繁所述；“拉结和利亚”是指对与该良善联结的真理的情感，“拉结”是指对内层真理的情感，“利亚”是指对外在真理的情感（参看<a href="3758.htm">3758</a>，<a href="3782.htm">3782</a>，<a href="3793.htm">3793</a>，<a href="3819.htm">3819</a>节）。显然，“打发人，叫她们到田野他的羊群那里去”表示将它们与自身联结起来。“田野”表示构成良善的事物，以及有良善存在之地（<a href="2971.htm">2971</a>，<a href="3196.htm">3196</a>，<a href="3310.htm">3310</a>，<a href="3317.htm">3317</a>节）；“羊群”表示现已获得的良善与真理本身，当这良善离开时，拉结和利亚所表示的真理情感就被运用于这些良善与真理。在本章，雅各代表属世层的良善，它离与神性的结合越来越近（<a href="4069.htm">4069</a>节），因为它处于准备使自己分离的状态，并且实际上已经与“拉班”所表示的良善分离了（参看前面关于雅各的论述，<a href="3775.htm">3775</a>节）。因为代表取决于良善与真理所发生的状态的改变；状态的改变则取决于灵人和处于这类良善与真理的天使的改变，如前所述（<a href="4067.htm">4067</a>节）。<br />随着灵人和处于居间良善的天使的社群离开，处于更完美的良善的新社群就会接近。人的状态完全取决于他在其中拥有其存在的灵人和天使的社群。这些社群决定了其意愿，以及其思维的状态。但是，当他自己为自己选择这些社群，也就是他将自己与它们联在一起时，他所经历的状态改变完全不同于主将这些社群与他联在一起时所经历的。当他将自己与它们联在一起时，邪恶在便他里面掌权；而当主将它们与其联在一起时，良善在他里面掌权。当良善在他里面掌权时，诸如有助于改造其生命的那类良善便通过这些社群流入进来。就内义而言，此处所说的事涉及“雅各”所代表的良善，“拉结和利亚”所表示的对真理的情感，以及当雅各离开“拉班”所表示的良善时，这些情感的用途；这些事就是这些社群及其改变的生动写照。 天使从这些社群来察觉人所具有的状态，由此察觉其良善与真理的性质，因而察觉在此人看来几乎如同一个整体的无数细节。因此，天使能意识到真正的起因，因为他们看见并觉察到与人同在的社群，而人能意识到结果，却看不见这些社群，只具有通过源于这些社群的状态改变所获得的对它们的一种模糊感知。对于良善与真理所发生的事，他什么也看不见，什么也觉察不到，除非他被主通过天使启示。</p>

And Jacob sent, and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock. That this signifies the adjunction of the affections of truth by the good now meant by "Jacob," and application at the time when 
it departed, is evident from the representation of Jacob, as being the good of the natural, often spoken of above; and from the representation of Rachel and Leah, as being the affections of truth that 
are adjoined to that good; "Rachel" the affection of interior truth; and "Leah" the affection of external truth (see n. 3758, 3782, 3793, 3819). That "sending to these and calling them to the field 
unto his flock," denotes to adjoin them to itself is manifest. "Field" signifies what is of good, and where there is good (n. 2971, 3196, 3310, 3317); and "flock" the goods and truths themselves which 
were now acquired, and to which the affections of truth meant by Rachel and Leah were applied when the good departed. Jacob in this chapter represents the good of the natural, in that it drew nearer 
to conjunction with the Divine (n. 4069), because it was in readiness to separate itself, and was in the act of separation, from the good signified by "Laban" (see what is said concerning Jacob above, 
n. 3775). For representations are according to the changes of state as to good and truth; and changes of state are according to the changes of spirits and angels who are in such good and truth, as was 
shown above (n. 4067). [2] When the societies of spirits and angels which are in mediate good recede, then new societies which are in a more perfect good draw near. Man's state is altogether according 
to the societies of spirits and angels in the midst of whom he is; such is his will, and such his thought. But his changes of state are quite different when he adjoins the societies to himself, or 
himself to them, from what they are when the societies are adjoined to him by the Lord. When he adjoins himself to them, he is in evil; but when they are adjoined to him by the Lord, he is in good. 
When he is in good, such good as serves for the reformation of his life flows in through the societies. What is here said in the internal sense respecting the good represented by Jacob, the affections 
of truth, which are "Rachel and Leah," and the application of these when he departed from the good signified by "Laban," is in exact accordance with the societies and their changes. From the societies 
the angels perceive the states the man has, thus the quality of his goods and truths, and consequently innumerable things which scarcely appear to the man as one general thing. Thus the angels are in 
the very causes, for they see and perceive the societies with the man, while the man is in the effects and does not see them, but has only an obscure perception of them, through some changes of state 
thence resulting; and sees nothing in regard to what is good and true, unless he is enlightened through angels by the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4073</b></p><p><b>4073.</b>
'Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field, to his flock' means a linking of the affections for truth to the good now meant by 'Jacob' - achieved by that good itself; also the use to which those 
affections were applied when that good departed. This is clear from the representation of 'Jacob' as the good of the natural, often dealt with already, and from the representation of 'Rachel and 
Leah' as affections for truth which were linked to that good - 'Rachel' the affection for interior truth, and 'Leah' the affection for external truth, dealt with in <a href="3758.htm">3758</a>, <a href="3782.htm">3782</a>, <a href="3793.htm">3793</a>, <a href="3819.htm">3819</a>. The fact that 
sending to them and calling them to the field, to his flock, means linking them to itself is self-evident. 'Field' means the things that constitute good, and the place where good exists, <a href="2971.htm">2971</a>, <a href="3196.htm">3196</a>, <a href="3310.htm">3310</a>, <a href="3317.htm">3317</a>, while 'flock' means the actual goods and truths which had now been acquired and to which the affections for truth meant by 'Rachel' and 'Leah' were to be applied when that good departed. 
'Jacob' in this chapter represents the good of the Natural which was to become joined more closely to the Divine, <a href="4069.htm">4069</a>, since it was in a state of readiness to separate itself, and was actually doing 
so, from the good meant by 'Laban' - see what is said about Jacob in <a href="3775.htm">3775</a>. For representations are conditioned by the changes of state that happen to good and truth, and changes of state are conditioned 
by the changes which spirits and angels who are governed by such good and truth undergo, discussed above in <a href="4067.htm">4067</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
  With the departure of the communities of spirits and angels that are governed 
by intermediate good new communities draw nigh which are governed by a more perfect type of good. Man's state is altogether conditioned by the communities of spirits and angels in whose midst he has 
his being. These determine the state of his will and also that of his thought. But when he himself chooses those communities for himself, that is, when he links himself to them, the changes of state 
which he undergoes are entirely different from when those communities are linked to him by the Lord. When he links himself to them evil reigns in him, but when they are linked to him by the Lord good 
reigns in him. When good reigns in him the kind of good that flows in by way of those communities is such as contributes to the reformation of his life. The things that are stated here in the internal 
sense about the good represented by 'Jacob', about the affections for truth meant by 'Rachel' and 'Leah', and about the use to which these affections were applied when that good departed from the good 
meant by 'Laban', give an exact and vivid picture of the communities and the changes they undergo. From these communities angels perceive the states which exist with man, and so perceive the nature 
of his goods and truths. Consequently they perceive countless details which are seen by man as little more than a single whole. Angels therefore are aware of actual causes since they see and perceive 
those communities, whereas man is aware of effects and does not see those communities, but has merely a dim perception of them gained through some changes of state which originate in those communities. 
He sees and perceives nothing regarding what is happening to good and truth, unless he is enlightened by the Lord through angels. </p>

`Et misit Jacob et vocavit Rachelem et Leam agrum ad gregem suum': quod significet adjunctionem affectionum veri a bono per `Jacobum' nunc intellecto et applicationem tunc cum discederet, constat 
a repraesentatione `Jacobi' quod sit bonum naturalis, de qua saepius prius; et a repraesentatione `Rachelis et Leae' quod sint affectiones veri illi bono adjunctae, `Rachel' affectio veri interioris, 
et {1} `Leah' affectio veri externi, de qua n. 3758, 3782, 3793, 3819; quod `mittere ad illos et vocare agrum ad gregem suum' sit adjungere sibi, patet; `ager' significat illa quae boni sunt, et 
ubi bonum, n. 2971, 3196, 3310, 3317; et `grex' ipsa bona et vera quae nunc acquisita sunt, quibus affectiones veri per `Rachelem et Leam' intellectae applicarentur, cum discederet: </p>
<p>`Jacob' in hoc 
capite repraesentat bonum Naturalis quod propius accederet ad conjunctionem cum Divino, n. 4069, quia in procinctu se separandi fuit, (o)et in separatione, a bono per `Labanem' significato, videatur 
de Jacobo n. 3775; repraesentationes enim se habent secundum mutationes status quoad bonum et verum, ac mutationes status secundum mutationes spirituum et angelorum qui in tali bono et vero sunt, 
secundum illa quae supra n. 4067 dicta sunt: [2] cum societates spirituum et angelorum quae in bono medio sunt: recedunt, tunc societates novae accedunt quae in perfectiore bono sunt; status hominis 
prorsus se habet secundum societates spirituum et angelorum in quorum medio est; talis est ejus voluntas et talis ejus cogitatio; sed mutationes ejus status se prorsus aliter habent cum ipse sibi 
societates illas adsciscit seu ipse se illis adjungit, et aliter cum societates illae adjunguntur ei a Domino; cum ipse se illis adjungit, tunc est in malo; cum autem ei adjunguntur a Domino, tunc 
est in bono; cum in bono, (o)tunc per societates illas influit tale bonum quale inservit ejus vitae reformationi: quae hic in sensu interno dicuntur de bono per `Jacobum' repraesentato, de affectionibus 
veri quae sunt `Rachel et Leah' et de applicatione harum cum discederet a bono per `Labanem' significato, se prorsus ita ad vivum cum societatibus et earum mutationibus habent; ex illis angeli 
percipiunt status qui apud hominem sunt, ita ejus bona et vera qualia sunt; proinde innumerabilia quae homini vix ut unum commune apparent; inde angeli sunt in ipsis causis nam societates illas 
{2} vident et percipiunt, homo autem in effectibus et non illas videt, sed modo obscure percipere potest per aliquas status mutationes quae sunt inde, et nihil quoad bonum et verum nisi illustretur 
per angelos a Domino.      @1 at$      @2 ipsas societates$ </p>
