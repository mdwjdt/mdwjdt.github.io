<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5380节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5380.</strong>从肾脏直到膀胱的一系列分泌物和排泄物的存在是众所周知的。在这个系列中，肾脏在首，然后输尿管在中间，膀胱则在末。构成大人里的这些区域的人以同样的方式存在于一个系列中；尽管他们属于同一个属，然而就这个属里面的种类而言，他们彼此还是有区别的。他们说话时，声音沙哑、粗糙，好像裂成两道。他们还渴望进入身体；不过，这仅仅停留在他们的这种尝试或努力中。他们相对于人体的位置如下：与肾脏有关的，离肘部下面的左侧身体很近；与输尿管有关的，离左侧身体较远；与膀胱有关的，离得更远。他们一起在左侧前方几乎形成一条抛物线；因为他们在左侧前方伸展成这样的形状，并在如此行的过程中占据了相当长的区域。这条路是通向地狱的常见路径，而另一条路则经过肠道；因为这两条路都终止于地狱。那些在地狱里的人就对应于诸如经由肠子和膀胱排泄出去的那类废物；他们所陷入的邪恶与虚假在灵义上无非是尿液和粪便。</p>

It is known that there are secretions and excretions, in a series, from the kidneys down to the bladder. In the first of the series are the kidneys, in the middle of it are the ureters, and in the last 
is the bladder. They who constitute these provinces in the Grand Man are in like manner in a series; and although they are of one genus, they differ as do the species of this genus. They speak with 
a raucous voice as if cracked, and desire to introduce themselves into the body; but this is only an endeavor. Their situation in respect to the human body is as follows. They who relate to the kidneys 
are on the left side close to the body under the elbow; they who relate to the ureters are to the left farther off from the body; and they who relate to the bladder are still farther away. Together 
they form almost a parabola from the left side toward the front; for in this way they project themselves from the left toward the front; thus in a rather long course. This is one common way to the hells, 
the other is through the intestines, for both these ways end in the hells; for they who are in the hells correspond to such things as are excreted by the intestines and the bladder, the falsities 
and evils in which they are being nothing but urine and excrement in a spiritual sense. </p>

It is well known that there are secretions and excretions and that there is a sequence of these extending from the kidneys through to the bladder. The kidneys come first in the sequence, then the ureters 
in the middle, and the bladder at the end of it. Those constituting these provinces in the Grand Man exist in a similar way in a sequence. But although they all belong to the same genus, they nevertheless 
differ from one another so far as species within that genus are concerned. When they speak their voices sound rough, as though split in two. They also have the desire to get into the body; but 
this remains as no more than their attempt to do so. Their position in relation to the rest of the human body is as follows: Those who correlate with the kidneys are very close to the body on the left 
hand side beneath the elbow; those who correlate with the ureters are further away from the body on the left hand side; and those who correlate with the bladder are still further away. All these together 
form, at the front on the left hand side, a virtual parabola; for they distend themselves into a shape like this at the front on the left hand side and in so doing occupy quite an elongated area. 
This path is the general one that leads to the hells, while another one passes through the intestines; for both these paths terminate in the hells. Those in the hells correspond to the kinds of waste 
products that are excreted through the intestines and bladder, the falsities and evils present with them being nothing else in the spiritual sense than urine and excrement. </p>

Notum est quod secretiones et excretiones sint, et illae in serie, a renibus usque in vesicam; in primo seriei sunt renes, in medio ejus ureteres,et in ultimo vesica; illi qui in Maximo Homine provincias 
illas constituunt, {1} similiter sunt in serie, et tametsi unius generis sunt, usque sicut species illius generis differunt; {2} loquuntur voce rauca sicut bifida, et inferre se cupiunt in corpus 
{3}, verum est modo conatus; situs eorum respective ad humanum corpus est talis: qui renes referunt, a latere sinistro proxime ad corpus sunt sub ulna; qui ureteres, sunt versus sinistrum abinde a corpore 
longius; qui vesicam adhuc longius, formant simul a latere sinistro versus anteriora paene parabolam, nam sic se projiciunt versus anteriora a sinistris, ita satis longo tractu; haec via communis 
una est versus inferna, altera est per intestina, nam terminatur utrobivis in infernis; correspondent (t)enim illi qui in infernis talibus quae excernuntur per intestina et per vesicam {4}; falsa enim 
et mala in quibus sunt, non sunt, nisi quam lotium {5} et excrementa in sensu spirituali. @1 before illi$ @2 qui mediam secretionem referunt, sunt, infra ulnam prope ad latus$ @3 intus$ @4 sunt 
excrementa, sicca quae intestinorum, et liquida quae vesicae, quibus etiam correspondent, nempe falsa ibi excrementis liquidis seu urinis, et mala excrementis siccis, in talibus etiam degere sibi videatur 
quia talia in altera vita amant, et illa amant quia correspondent, nam quae correspondent etiam concordant sicut id quod in effectu est ex causa, inde$ @5 faeces$ </p>
