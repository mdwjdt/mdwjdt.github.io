<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第645节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>645.</strong>“内外都要抹上柏油”表从恶欲的洪流中解脱出来，这一点从前面所述明显可知。因为首先要改造的是该教会成员的觉知之物，因此他从毁灭整个救赎行为的恶欲洪流中被解脱出来。事实上，原文并非说“抹上柏油”，而是用了一个表示“保护”的词，这个词源于“遮罪”或“安抚” 的词根，因此它含有同样的意思。主的遮罪或安抚就是从邪恶的洪流中解脱出来。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]645.</strong> The symbolism of tarring it inside and out with tar as being preserved from a flood of desire can be seen from what was said above [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_645/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_641" target=_top>641-642</a>]: the people of this church first needed to reform the functioning of their intellect and so were preserved from a flood of desire, which would destroy all the work of reformation.<br />The original [Hebrew] text does not actually say "tar with tar" but uses a term that refers to protection. The term comes from one for atone or appease and therefore involves similar ideas.{*1} Atonement, or the appeasement of the Lord, is protection from a flood of evil.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg is saying (in the previous sentence) that the Hebrew text actually reads "protect it with tar" rather than "tar it with tar." The question, then, is why he chose to translate the verb as "tar" rather than as "protect." The verb at issue, כָּפַרְתָּ (kāṕartā), may be etymologically related either to the noun for tar, כֹּפֶר (kōṕer), or to כִּפֶּר (kipper), a verb whose concrete meaning is "cover" but whose more common, abstract meaning is "atone" or "appease" (see note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_645/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_308" target=_top>308</a>). Though dictionaries disagree on the point, Swedenborg clearly accepts both connections. On the basis of the relationship with kōṕer, "tar," he feels justified in translating it simply with the verb "to tar." However, on the basis of the verb's relationship with kipper, "cover" or "atone," he identifies the real meaning as "protect," for two possible reasons. One is that covering the ark with tar is the same as protecting it with tar. The other is that Swedenborg describes atonement as a form of protection (see the following sentence in the section). This meaning, "protect," provides a parallel with the symbolism of preservation that Swedenborg gives for the expression "tarring with tar." No matter whether kāṕartā is in fact related by etymology to kōṕer or kipper, it is associated with both by sound, since all three Hebrew words are based on the same string of consonants. [LHC] </p>

That to "pitch it within and without with pitch" signifies preservation from an inundation of cupidities, is evident from what has been said before. For the man of this church was first to be reformed 
as to the things of his understanding, and therefore he was preserved from an inundation of cupidities, which would destroy all the work of reformation. In the original text it is not indeed said that 
it was to be "pitched with pitch" but a word is used which denotes "protection" derived from "expiate" or "propitiate" and therefore it involves the same. The expiation or propitiation of the Lord 
is protection from the inundation of evil. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 645</b></p><p><b>645.</b>
'Bitumening it inside and out with bitumen' means preservation from the deluge of evil desires. This is clear from what has been stated already. In fact the member of this Church had first of all to 
be reformed as regards the things of his understanding. This was why he was preserved from the deluge of evil desires which would have destroyed the whole work of reformation. The original text does not 
in fact read 'bitumened with bitumen', but uses an expression which denotes protection and is derived from a root meaning to make satisfaction or to appease, and so embodies the same idea. Satisfying 
or appeasing the Lord is protection from the deluge of evil.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 645</b>
</p><b>645.</b>
Quod per 'bituminare eam intus et extus bitumine' significetur conservatio a cupiditatum inundatione, constat ab illis quae prius dicta sunt: homo enim hujus Ecclesiae reformandus prius erat quoad ejus 
intellectualia; quare conservatus est ab inundatione cupiditatum, quae omne reformationis opus destruerent.  In textu originali non quidem legitur quod bitumine bituminaretur; sed adhibetur vox {1} 
quae denotat protectionem, derivata ab expiare aut propitiare, quare simile involvit; expiatio seu propitiatio Domini est protectio ab inundatione mali. 	@1 In the Heb. there is a remarkable and significant 
resemblance between [ ] (gopher)=? cypress, [ ], (kopher)=? cypress, and [ ] (kaphar)=cover, forgive (sins).  All these occur in this verse; 'pitch' may be derived from cypress but it is not 
actually mentioned.$ </p>
