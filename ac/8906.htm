<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8906节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8906.</strong>不可偷盗表不可将人的属灵良善或财产从他那里夺走，不可将属于主的事物归于自己。这从“偷盗”的含义清楚可知，“偷盗”是指从某人那里夺走属灵良善或财产。“偷盗”之所以具有这些含义，是因为财物和财富在灵义上是指关于良善和真理的认知或知识，总体上构成信和仁，也就是一个人所拥有的属灵生命的一切。因此，从某人那里夺走这些东西就是“偷盗”在灵义上所表示的。由于一切属灵良善，也就是信和仁的一切，完全来自主，绝非来自人，故“偷盗”还表示将属于主的东西归于自己。在约翰福音中，凡如此行的人还被称为“贼和强盗”：<br />我实实在在地告诉你们：人进羊圈，不从门进去，倒从别处爬进去，那人就是贼，就是强盗。从门进去的，才是羊的牧人。我就是门，凡从我进来的，必然得救，并且可进出，找到草场。盗贼来，无非要偷窃、杀害、毁坏；我来了，是要叫人得生命，并且得的更丰盛。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.1.htm">10:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.10.htm">10</a>）<br />“从门进羊圈”是指从主进入，因为主是“门”，如祂自己所说的；“羊”是指那些拥有仁，由此拥有信的人。当这些人承认，信和仁的一切皆来自祂，或说祂是构成信和仁的一切的源头时，他们就是从主进入的；因为这时，这些从祂流入。但将它们归于其他人，尤其归于自己，就是把它们夺走，因而是“杀害、毁坏”它们。将属于主的东西完全归于自己的人还认为功德在于行为中，认为自己是公义的（参看<a href="1110.htm">1110</a>，<a href="1877.htm">1877</a>，<a href="2027.htm">2027</a>，<a href="2273.htm">2273</a>，<a href="2340.htm">2340</a>，<a href="2373.htm">2373</a>，<a href="2400.htm">2400</a>，<a href="3816.htm">3816</a>，<a href="4007.htm">4007</a>e，<a href="4174.htm">4174</a>，<a href="4943.htm">4943</a>，<a href="6388.htm">6388</a>-<a href="6390.htm">6390</a>，<a href="6392.htm">6392</a>，<a href="6393.htm">6393</a>，<a href="6478.htm">6478</a>节）。这就是灵义上的“偷盗”，当世人在圣言中读到“偷盗”时，天上的天使就会想到这层含义；因为天使完全在一个属灵层面上理解圣言。<br />在何西阿书，“贼”具有同样的含义：<br />我医治以色列的时候，以法莲的罪孽和撒马利亚的罪恶就显露出来。他们行事虚谎，贼人到来，强盗成群包围房子。他们所行的现在缠绕他们，都在我面前；他们以自己的恶行使君王欢喜，用自己的虚谎叫首领喜乐。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何7.1.htm">7:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何7.3.htm">3</a>）<br />约珥书：<br />耶和华的日子将到。它前面有火吞噬，它后面有火焰燃烧；地在它面前如伊甸园，它后面却有荒凉的旷野。它的形状如马的形状；它们奔跑如马兵，在山顶上跳跃，如战车的响声。它们在城里来回奔跑，蹿上墙，爬进房屋，从窗户进来，如同盗贼。大地将在祂面前震动，诸天将要颤抖，日月昏暗，星星也不再发光。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.1.htm">2:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.10.htm">10</a>）<br />此处论述的主题是教会的荒凉，这时虚假闯入并摧毁真理；这些虚假就是“爬进房屋，从窗户进来的盗贼”。难道会没有人想知道为什么经上说“耶和华的日子将如马的形状”、那时“它们奔跑如马兵，在城里来回奔跑，蹿上墙，爬进房屋，从窗户进来”、“大地将要震动，诸天颤抖，日月昏暗，星星也不再发光”？对内义一无所知，从心里对圣言的神圣性产生怀疑的人会说，这些纯粹是没有任何神的东西隐藏在里面的简单话；他或许还会声称这些话毫无意义，没有价值。但相信圣言是最神圣的，因为它是神性，而且还知道有一个论述教会、天堂和主自己的内义之人，则会声称其中的每一个词都有自己的分量。因此，下面对这段经文中的词句表示什么给出一个简要的解释。<br />“耶和华的日子”是指教会的末后状态或末期，这时不再有任何真理，相反，虚假取代了真理；“它前面吞噬的火”是指对邪恶的欲望；“它后面燃烧的火焰”是指由此而来的对虚假的欲望；“马的形状”是指出于推理如同出于真理那样进行推理的理性能力；“奔跑的马兵”是指推理者；“战车”是指支持虚假的教义事物；“城”是指教义本身；“它们所蹿上的墙”是指一种虚假的本质；“它们所爬进的房屋”是指一个人的意愿；“他们进来所经由的窗户”是指理性概念；“盗贼”是指夺走真理的虚假；“在祂面前震动的大地”是指教会，“将要颤抖的诸天”也是；“日”是指对主之爱；“月”是指对主之信，当它们不再显现时，经上说它们“昏暗”；“星星”是指关于良善和真理的认知或知识，这些认知或知识不再从信和爱，因而从天堂拥有光，这一点由“它们不再发光”来表示。由此可见这些话总体上是什么意思，以及那日或教会的末后状态在哪层意义上被称为将要“爬进房屋，从窗户进来的盗贼”，即：那时，正是虚假将要占据整个人，占据他的意愿和理解力，从而夺走一切真理和良善。俄巴底亚书中的“盗贼”具有类似含义：<br />主耶和华对以东说，盗贼若来到你那里，或倾覆的人趁夜间而来（你何竟被剪除），岂不偷窃，直到够了呢？（俄巴底亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/俄1.1.htm">1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/俄1.5.htm">5</a>）<br />撒迦利亚书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚5.1.htm">5:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚5.4.htm">4</a>）、诗篇（<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗50.18.htm">50:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗50.20.htm">20</a>）、马太福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太6.19.htm">6:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太6.20.htm">20</a>）中的“盗贼”或“偷窃的人”具有类似含义。<br />由于主吩咐给以色列人的一切律例都建立在存在于天堂的秩序律法之上，也就是说，它们从灵界获得自己的存在和本质，所以关于盗贼所制定的律法也是如此，如这一律例：人若偷牛并卖了，就要赔五只，四羊赔一羊（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出22.1.htm">22:1</a>）；还有这些律法：<br />盗贼若闯进来被击打，那人是没有流人血之罪的。若太阳已经出来，就有流人血之罪了。贼必要赔还或被卖。若发现他所偷的在他手下，他就要加倍赔还。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出22.2.htm">22:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出22.4.htm">4</a>）<br />出埃及记：<br />窃取人，或是把他卖了，若被发现还在他手下，必要把他处死。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出21.16.htm">21:16</a>）<br />申命记：<br />若遇见人从以色列人中窃取他弟兄中的一个灵魂，卖了他从他身上谋利，那贼就必处死。这样，便将那恶从你们中间除掉。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申24.7.htm">24:7</a>）<br />“以色列人中的人”在内义上是指那些处于信之真理和良善的人，因而在抽象意义上是指信之真理和良善（<a href="5414.htm">5414</a>，<a href="5879.htm">5879</a>，<a href="5951.htm">5951</a>节）；因此，“窃取以色列人中的人”是指把这些夺走，“卖他”是指疏远或扔掉它们，以及使它们陷入奴役的状态。事实上，信之真理和良善因来自主，故处于自由的状态，唯独事奉主；但当它们被扔掉或疏远时，就陷入奴役的状态，因为它们事奉爱自己或爱世界的某种邪恶，因而事奉某种肉体情欲。上述（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申24.7.htm">24:7</a>中的）律法便源于这一点，并与其相对应；由于教会的真理和良善从自由变成了奴役，因而从活的变成了死的，所以作为后果的惩罚就是“死”。</p>

Thou shalt not steal. That this signifies that no one's spiritual goods must be taken away from him, and that those things which belong to the Lord are not to be attributed to self, is evident from the 
signification of "stealing," as being to take away spiritual goods from anyone. That this is signified by "stealing," is because riches and wealth in the spiritual sense are the knowledges of good 
and truth, in general all those things which are of faith and charity, that is, which are of spiritual life in man. Wherefore to take these things away from anyone is "to steal" in the spiritual sense. 
And because all spiritual goods, that is, all things of faith and charity, are from the Lord alone, and absolutely nothing from man, therefore by "stealing" is also signified to attribute to oneself 
what belongs to the Lord. They who do this are also called "thieves and robbers" in John: </p>
<p>     Verily I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other 
way, the same is a thief and a robber; but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. I am the door; by Me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out, and find 
pasture. The thief cometh not but that he may steal, and slay, and destroy; I came that they may have life, and may have abundance (John 10:1, 2, 9, 10). "To enter by the door into the sheepfold" 
denotes to enter by the Lord, for the Lord is the "door," as He Himself says; "the sheep" are they who are in charity and thence in faith. These enter by the Lord when they acknowledge that from Him is 
everything of faith and charity, for then these flow in from Him. But to attribute them to others, especially to themselves, is to take them away, thus "to slay and to destroy." They who attribute to 
themselves what is the Lord's, also place merit in works, and make themselves righteousness (see n. 1110, 1877, 2027, 2273, 2340, 2373, 2400, 3816, 4007, 4174, 4943, 6388-6390, 6392, 6393, 6478). This 
then is "stealing" in the spiritual sense, and this comes to the angels in heaven when man reads in the Word about "stealing," for the angels understand the Word only spiritually. [2] The like is 
signified by "stealing" in Hosea: </p>
<p>     When I healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was revealed, and the evils of Samaria; because they wrought a lie; and the thief cometh, the troop spreadeth 
itself abroad; now do their works encompass them before My faces; they make the king glad by their wickedness, and the princes by their lies (Hos. 7:1-3). And in Joel: </p>
<p>     The day of Jehovah cometh. 
A fire devoureth before it, and after it a flame burneth; the land is as the garden of Eden before it, but after it a waste wilderness. The appearance thereof is as the appearance of horses; and as 
horsemen, so do they run, as the sound of chariots on the tops of the mountains; they run to and fro in the city, they run on the wall, they climb up into the houses, they enter in through the windows 
like a thief. The earth quaked before Him, the heavens trembled, the sun and the moon were made black, and the stars withdrew their shining (Joel 2:1-10). The subject here treated of is the desolation 
of the church, when falsities break in and destroy truths; these falsities are the "thieves who climb up into houses and enter in through the windows." Who can help wondering why it is said that "the 
day of Jehovah will be as the appearance of horses," and that then "they shall run like horsemen, they shall run to and fro in the city, they shall run on the wall, shall climb up into the houses, 
shall enter in through the windows, the earth shall quake, the heavens shall tremble, the sun and the moon shall be made black, and the stars shall withdraw their shining?" He who knows nothing of the 
internal sense, and who in his heart calls the holiness of the Word into doubt, will say that these are mere words devoid of anything Divine stored up within them, and perhaps will call them worthless 
sayings. But he who believes that the Word is most holy, because it is Divine, and who moreover knows that there is an internal sense which treats of the church, of heaven, and of the Lord Himself, 
will confess that every word herein has its own weighty import. It shall therefore be briefly unfolded what the words and sayings in this passage signify. [3] "The day of Jehovah" denotes the last state, 
or last time, of the church, when there is no longer any truth, but falsity in the place of truth; "the fire which devours before it" denotes the desire of evil; "the flame which burns after it" 
denotes the consequent desire of falsity; "the appearance of horses" denotes the intellectual reasoning from falsity as if from truth; "the horsemen who run" denote reasoners; "the chariots" denote doctrinal 
things of falsity; "a city" denotes the doctrine itself; "the wall upon which they run" denotes essential falsity; "the houses into which they climb" denotes the will of man; "the windows through 
which they enter in" denote intellectual things; "the thief" denotes the falsity which takes away truth; "the earth which will quake before Him" denotes the church, so also do "the heavens which 
will tremble;" "the sun" denotes love to the Lord; "the moon," faith in Him, these are said to be "made black" when they no longer appear; "the stars" denote the knowledges of good and truth which will 
no longer have light from faith and love, thus from heaven, and this is meant by "withdrawing their shining." From all this it can be seen what these words involve in general, and also in what sense 
"that day," or the last state of the church, is called "a thief who will climb up into the houses, and enter in through the windows," namely, that it is falsity, which will then take possession of the 
whole man, both of his will and of his understanding, and thus will take away all truth and good. The like is signified by a "thief" in Obadiah: </p>
<p>     The Lord Jehovih said to Edom, If thieves came 
to thee, if destroyers by night (how art thou cut off!), will they not steal till they have enough? (Obad. 1, 5).      In like manner by a "thief," or "one who steals," in Zech. 5:1-4; Ps. 50:18-20; 
Matt. 6:19, 20. [4] As all the statutes commanded the sons of Israel by the Lord were founded on the laws of order which are in heaven, that is, derived their existence and essence from the spiritual 
world, so for the same reason were the statutes which were enacted concerning theft; as that he who stole an ox and sold it should restore five, if a sheep four (Exod. 22:1); also that if a thief be 
smitten in breaking in, there shall be no blood; but if the sun be risen, there shall be blood; the thief shall repay or shall be sold; if the theft be found in his hand, he shall restore double (Exod. 
22:2-4).      He that stealeth a man, and selleth him, but if he be found in his hand, dying he shall die (Exod. 21:16).      If a man be found who hath stolen a soul of his brethren, of the sons 
of Israel, and hath made gain in him, while he sold him, that thief shall be killed; that thou mayest put away the evil from the midst of thee (Deut. 24:7). in the internal sense "the men of the sons 
of Israel" denote those who are in the truths and goods of faith, thus in the abstract sense they denote the truths and goods of faith (n. 5414, 5879, 5951); and therefore "to steal a man of the sons 
of Israel" denotes to take these away, and "to sell him" denotes to cast them off, and also to make them serve. For the truths and goods of faith, being from the Lord, are in a free state, and serve 
the Lord alone; but when they are cast off, they then come into a servile state, for they serve any evil of the love of self or of the love of the world, thus any bodily cupidity; whence come the derivation 
and correspondence of the above law. And as then from being free the truth and good of the church become servile, thus from being alive become dead, therefore the penalty which is the effect, is "death." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8906</b></p><p><b>8906.</b>
'You shall not steal' means that no one's spiritual goods or possessions must be taken away from him, and that things which are the Lord's must not be attributed to self. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'stealing' as taking spiritual goods or possessions away from someone. The reason why 'stealing' has these meanings is that wealth and riches in the spiritual sense are cognitions or knowledge of 
goodness and truth, in general everything that composes the faith and charity, that is, the spiritual life a person has. Therefore taking these away from someone is what 'stealing' means in the spiritual 
sense. And since all spiritual goods or possessions, that is, everything composing faith and charity, come wholly from the Lord and not at all from man, 'stealing' also means attributing to self 
things which are the Lord's. People who do this are also called 'thieves' and 'robbers' in John, </p>
<blockquote>
Truly I say to you, he who does not enter by the door into the sheepfold but climbs in by another way, 
that man is a thief and a robber. But he who is entering by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. I am the door of the sheep. All who were before Me were thieves and were robbers, but the sheep did 
not hear them. I am the door; if anyone enters through Me he will be saved, and will go in and out, and find pasture. The thief does not come except to steal and to kill and to destroy. I have come 
in order that they may have life, and may have it abundantly <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2010:1-13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 10:1-13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Entering by the door into the sheepfold' doing so through the Lord, for the Lord is 'the door', as He Himself says. 'The 
sheep' are those who have charity and consequently faith, and they enter the fold through the Lord when they acknowledge that He is the source of everything composing faith and charity; for then these 
flow in from Him. But to attribute them to others, especially to self, is to take them away, which is 'to kill and destroy' them. People who attribute entirely to themselves those things which are the 
Lord's also assume that merit lies in works and consider themselves righteous; such people are dealt with in <a href="1110.htm">1110</a>, <a href="1877.htm">1877</a>, <a href="2027.htm">2027</a>, <a href="2273.htm">2273</a>, <a href="2340.htm">2340</a>, <a href="2373.htm">2373</a>, <a href="2400.htm">2400</a>, <a href="3816.htm">3816</a>, <a href="4007.htm">4007</a> (end), <a href="4174.htm">4174</a>, <a href="4943.htm">4943</a>, <a href="6388.htm">6388</a>-<a href="6390.htm">6390</a>, <a href="6392.htm">6392</a>, <a href="6393.htm">6393</a>, <a href="6478.htm">6478</a>. This then is 'stealing' in the spiritual sense, and it is what comes to mind with angels in heaven when a person reads in the Word about 'stealing'; for angels understand the Word wholly 
on a spiritual level. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 'Stealing' has a like meaning in Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
When I healed Israel the iniquity of Ephraim was revealed, and the evils of Samaria; for they practiced a lie, and a thief came, 
a band [of robbers] encircles the house.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> Now their own works surround them before My face; they make a king glad through their wickedness, and princes through their lies. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%207:1-3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 7:1-3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in Joel, </p>
<blockquote>
The 
day of Jehovah comes. Fire devours before him, and behind him a flame burns; like the garden of Eden is the land before him, but behind him there is a desert waste. Its appearance is like the 
appearance of horses, and like horsemen, so they run. Like the noise of chariots over the peaks of mountains [they leap]. They run about the city, they run on the wall, they climb up into the houses, 
they go in through the windows like a thief. The earth quaked before him, the heavens trembled. The sun and the moon were darkened, and the stars withdrew their shining. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%202:1-10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 2:1-10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to 
the desolation of the Church, when falsities break in and destroy truths. These falsities are 'the thieves that climb up houses and go in through the windows'. Will anyone fail to wonder why it says 
that the day of Jehovah will be 'like the appearance of horses', and that at this time 'like horsemen, so they will run', 'they will run about the city, run on the wall, climb up into the houses, and 
go in through the windows', and 'the earth will quake, the heavens will tremble, the sun and moon will be darkened, and the stars will withdraw their shining'? The person who does not know anything about 
the internal sense and in his heart calls into doubt the holiness of the Word will say that these are simply words without anything of God concealed in them; and he will perhaps call the sayings 
meaningless. But the person who believes that the Word is most holy because it is Divine, and furthermore knows that there is an internal sense, in which the Church, heaven, and the Lord Himself are the 
subject, will profess that every word there carries weight. Therefore let a brief explanation be given of what the words and sayings there mean. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 'The day of Jehovah' is the final state or final 
period of the Church, when there is no longer truth but falsity instead. 'The fire' which devours before him is the desire for evil, and 'the fire' which burns after him is the resulting desire for 
falsity. 'The appearance of horses' is intellectual powers that reason from falsity as if from truth; 'the horsemen' who run are reasoners; 'chariots' are matters of doctrine that uphold falsity; 'the 
city' is doctrine itself; 'the wall' on which they run is a false essential; 'the houses' which they will climb up are a person's will; 'the windows' which they will go in through are intellectual 
concepts; 'a thief' is falsity which takes away truth; 'the earth' which will quake before him is the Church, and so are 'the heavens' which will tremble; 'the sun' is love to the Lord, 'the moon' faith 
in Him, which are said 'to be darkened' when they are no longer apparent; 'the stars' are cognitions or knowledge of goodness and truth which will no longer possess light from faith and love, thus 
from heaven, meant by 'withdrawing their shining'. From all this one may recognize what these words in general imply, and also in what sense that day or final state of the Church is called 'a thief' who 
will climb up houses and go in through the windows - falsity which will at that time take possession of the entire person, of both his will and his understanding, and so will take away all truth and 
goodness. 'A thief' has a like meaning in Obadiah, </p>
<p>The Lord Jehovih said to Edom, If thieves come to you, if those who overturn in the night - how you will have been cut off! - will they not steal 
that which is enough for themselves? Obad. verses 1, 5. </p>
<p>'A thief' or 'one who steals' has a like meaning in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%205:1-4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 5:1-4</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2050:18-20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 50:18-20</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%206:19,%2020&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 6:19, 20</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 As all the regulations which the Lord 
commanded the children of Israel were founded on the laws of order which exist in heaven, that is, they sprang from the spiritual world and derived their essential nature from there, this was no less 
so with the laws laid down regarding thefts, such as the law, </p>
<blockquote>
Anyone who has stolen an ox and sells it shall repay five, or four if one of the flock. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2021:37&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 21:37</a>.

Anyone who steals a man and sells him - and he is found in his hand - shall surely die. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2021:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 21:16</a>.

<blockquote>
If there is found a man who has stolen a soul from 
his brothers, from the children of Israel, and has made profit on him, when he has sold him, that thief shall be killed, so that you remove evil from the midst of you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2024:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 24:7</a>.

<p>'Men from the children 
of Israel' in the internal sense are those who are governed by the truths and forms of the good of faith. Accordingly in the abstract sense they are the truths and forms of good themselves, <a href="5414.htm">5414</a>, 
<a href="5879.htm">5879</a>, <a href="5951.htm">5951</a>, so that 'stealing a man from the children of Israel' means taking these away, and 'selling him' means alienating them and also reducing them to a state of servitude. For since truths and 
forms of the good of faith come from the Lord they exist in a state of freedom, and are subservient to none except the Lord alone; but when they are alienated they come into a state of servitude since 
they are subservient to some evil of self-love or love of the world, thus to some bodily desire. This is how that law [in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2024:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 24:7</a>] was derived and what it corresponds to; and since from being in 
freedom the Church's truth and good is reduced to subservience, and so from being living is made dead, the punishment, which is the outcome, is death.

</p><b>8906.</b>
`Non furaberis': quod significet quod non alicui ejus bona spiritualia auferenda sint, et quod sibi non tribuenda quae Domini sunt, constat ex significatione `furari' quod sit (x)auferre alicui bona 
spiritualia; quod haec per `furari' significentur, est quia divitiae et opes in spirituali sensu sunt cognitiones boni et veri, in genere omnia illa quae fidei et charitatis, hoc est, quae vitae spiritualis 
apud hominem sunt, quapropter illa alicui auferre est in sensu spirituali furari'; et quia omnia bona spiritualia, hoc est, omnia fidei et charitatis, sunt unice a Domino et prorsus nihil ab homine, 
idcirco per `furari' etiam significatur sibi tribuere quae Domini sunt; qui hoc faciunt vocantur etiam {1} `fures' et `praedones' apud Johannem, 	Amen dico vobis, Qui non (t)ingrediens est per 
januam in caulam ovium, sed `ascendit' aliunde, is est fur et latro; qui vero ingrediens est per januam, pastor est ovium; Ego sum janua [ovium; omnes qui ante Me fuerunt, fures fuerunt et latrones fuerunt, 
sed non, audiverunt illos oves.  Ego sum janua] per Me si quis introiverit, salvabitur, et ingredietur et egredietur, et pascuum inveniet; fur non venit nisi ut furetur et mactet et perdat; Ego 
veni ut vitam habeant, et abundantiam habeant, x 1-13; </p>
<p>`ingredi per januam in caulam ovium' est per Dominum, nam Dominus est `janua,' ut Ipse dicit; `oves' sunt qui in charitate et inde in fide; hi 
per `Dominum' ingrediuntur cum agnoscunt quod ab Ipso omne fidei et charitatis, nam haec tunc ab Ipso influunt {2}; </p>
<p>at aliis tribuere illa, imprimis sibi, est auferre illa, ita `mactare et perdere'; 
qui (x)sibimetipsis tribuunt illa quae Domini sunt, etiam in operibus ponunt meritum, et semet {3} faciunt justitiam, de quibus n. 1110 (x), 1877, 2027, 2273, 2340, 2373, 2400, 3816, 4007 fin., 4174, 
4943, 6388-6390, 6392, 6393,  (x)6478; hoc nunc est `furari' in (t)spirituali sensu, (m)et hoc obvenit angelis in caelo cum ab homine legitur in Verbo `furari,' nam angeli Verbum non nisi quam spiritualiter 
intelligunt {4}.(n) 	[2] Simile per `furari' significatur {5} apud Hoscheam, 	Quando sanavi Israelem, tunc revelata est iniquitas Ephraimi, et mala Samariae, quia fecerunt mendacium, et fur 
venit, diffundit se turma foras; (x)nunc circumdant illos opera illorum coram faciebus Meis; per malitiam suam laetificant regem, et per mendacia sua principes, vii 1-3: </p>
<p>et apud Joelem, 	Venit dies 
Jehovae, ante eum comedit ignis, et post eum inflammat flamma, sicut hortus Eden terra ante eum, sed post eum desertum vastitatis; sicut aspectus equorum aspectus illius, et sicut equites ita currunt, 
sicut sonitus curruum super verticibus montium; in urbe discurrunt, in muro currunt, in domos ascendunt, per fenestras ingrediuntur sicut fur; coram illo commota est terra, contremuerunt caeli, sol et 
luna atrati sunt, et stellae contraxerunt splendorem, ii 1-10; </p>
<p>agitur ibi de Ecclesiae desolatione, cum falsa irrumpunt et destruunt vera; falsa haec {6} sunt `fures qui ascendunt domos et per fenestras 
ingrediuntur'; quis non miraturus est cur dicitur quod `dies Jehovae erit sicut aspectus equorum' et quod tunc `sicut equites [ita] current, in urbe discurrent, in muro current, in domos ascendent, 
per fenestras ingredientur, commovebitur terra, contremiscent caeli, atrabuntur sol et luna, et contrahent splendorem stellae?' qui non de sensu interno aliquid scit, et qui in corde suo sanctitatem 
Verbi in dubium vocat, is dicet quod haec solum voces sint absque Divino inibi recondito, et forte vocabit {7} dictiones inanes; at qui credit quod Verbum sanctissimum sit, quia Divinum, et insuper 
(o)qui novit quod sensus internus sit, qui agit de Ecclesia, de caelo, deque Ipso Domino, {8} is fatebitur quod singulae voces ibi singula pondera sint; quid itaque voces et dictiones ibi significant, 
paucis explicandum: [3] `dies Jehovae' est ultimus status seu ultimum tempus' Ecclesiae, cum `non amplius' verum sed loco veri falsum, `ignis qui ante eum comedit {9} est mali cupido, `flamma quae post 
eum [inflammabit]' est falsi cupido inde, `aspectus equorum' est intellectuale ratiocinans ex falso sicut ex vero, `equites qui currunt {10}' sunt ratiocinatores, `currus' sunt doctrinalia falsi, 
`urbs' est ipsa doctrina, `murus in quo currunt' est essentiale falsum, `domus quas ascendent' est voluntarium hominis, `fenestrae per quas ingredientur' sunt intellectualia, `fur' est falsum quod aufert 
verum, terra quae coram illo commovebitur' est Ecclesia, etiam `caeli qui contremiscent,' `sol' est amor in Dominum, `luna' est fides in Ipsum, illa `atrari' dicuntur cum `non amplius' apparent, `stellae' 
sunt cognitiones boni et veri quae non amplius ex fide et amore, ita e caelo, lucem habebunt, quod est `contrahere splendorem'; ex his constare potest quid haec in communi involvunt, tum in quo 
sensu dies ille, seu {11} ultimus status Ecclesiae dicitur `fur qui ascendet domos et ingredietur per fenestras,' quod nempe sit falsum quod tunc {12} occupabit totum hominem, tam ejus voluntarium 
quam ejus intellectuale, et sic auferet omne verum et bonum.  Simile per `furem' significatur apud Obadiam, 	Dixit Dominus Jehovih Edomo, Si fures venerint tibi, si eversores noctu, quomodo excisus eris? 
nonne furabuntur quod illis satis? vers. [1,] 5: </p>
<p>similiter per `furem' seu `furantem,' Sach. v 1-4: {13} l 17-19 [A.V. 18-20]; {14} Matth. vi 19, 20. 	[4] Sicut omnia statuta a Domino mandata filiis 
Israelis fundata sunt in legibus ordinis quae in caelo, hoc est, existentiam et essentiam suam traxerunt e mundo spirituali, idcirco etiam illa quae de furtis lata sunt; sicut quod 	Qui furatus 
bovem et vendens, quinque rependet, si pecudem quattuor, Exod. (x)xxi 37 [A.V. xxii 1]: </p>
<p>tum, 	Fur in perfossione percussus, {15} non sanguis; orto autem {16} sole sanguis, fur rependet vel vendetur; 
si invenitur in manu ejus, restituet duplum, Exod. xxii 1-3 [A.V. 2-4]: </p>
<p>	Qui furatus fuerit virum eumque vendiderit, sed inventus fuerit in manu ejus, moriendo morietur, Exod. xxi 16: </p>
<p>	Si inventus 
{17} vir qui furatus {18} fuerit animam de fratribus suis, de filiis Israelis, et quaestum fecerit in eo, dum vendiderit eum, occidetur fur hic, ut removeas malum e medio tui, Deut. xxiv 7; </p>
<p>`viri ex 
filiis Israelis' in sensu interno sunt qui in veris et bonis fidei, ita in sensu abstracto sunt fidei vera et bona, (o)n. 5414, 5879, 5951, quare `furari virum ex filiis Israelis' est auferre illa, et 
`vendere illum' est abalienare, et quoque facere ut serviant; vera enim et bona fidei, quia a Domino, in statu libero sunt, nec serviunt nisi Soli Domino; at cum abalienantur, tunc in statum servum 
veniunt, nam serviunt alicui {19} malo amoris sui vel mundi, ita {20} alicui cupiditati corporeae; inde legis hujus derivatio et correspondentia; et quia tunc verum et bonum (o)Ecclesiae e libero fit 
servum, ita e vivo fit mortuum, ideo {21} poena, quae effectus, est mors {22}. @1 d illi vocantur i illi etiam$ @2 et per Ipsum ingredi, est agnoscere quod ab Ipso omne fidei et charitatis sit, nam
