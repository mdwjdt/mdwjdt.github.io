As is the case with possessions, so also is it with honors in the world; everyone is at liberty to provide himself with these also, yet not for the sake of himself, but for the sake of the neighbor; 
he who provides them for the sake of himself, provides ill for himself; but he who provides them for the sake of the neighbor, provides well for himself. For he who turns his ends to himself turns himself 
toward hell; but he who turns his ends from himself to the neighbor, turns himself toward heaven.            EXODUS 4 </p>
<p>     1. And Moses answered, and said, And behold they will not believe me, 
and will not hear my voice; for they will say, Jehovah hath not been seen of thee.      2. And Jehovah said unto him, What is that in thy hand? And he said, A rod.      3. And He said, Cast it to 
the earth. And he cast it to the earth, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.      4. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Put forth thy hand, and take hold of its tail; and he put forth his 
hand, and took hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand.      5. In order that they may believe that Jehovah hath been seen of thee, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, 
and the God of Jacob.      6. And Jehovah said further to him, Bring now thy hand into thy bosom. And he brought his hand into his bosom, and brought it out, and behold his hand was leprous as snow.  
    7. And He said, Bring back thine hand unto thy bosom; and he brought back his hand unto his bosom; and brought it forth out of his bosom, and behold it was turned again as his flesh.      8. 
And it shall be, if they do not believe thee, and hear the voice of the former sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.      9. And it shall be, if they do not believe also these 
two signs, and do not hear thy voice, that thou shalt take of the waters of the river, and pour out on the dry land, and the waters which thou hast taken out of the river, they shall become blood in the 
dry land.      10. And Moses said unto Jehovah, In me, my Lord, I am not a man of words, even from yesterday, even from the day before yesterday, even from now in Thy speaking unto Thy servant, because 
heavy of mouth, and heavy of tongue am I.      11. And Jehovah said unto him, Who maketh man's mouth? Or who hath made him dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I Jehovah?      12. And 
now go, and I will be with thy mouth, and I will teach thee what thou shalt speak.      13. And he said, In me, my Lord, send I pray by the hand Thou wilt send.      14. And the anger of Jehovah was 
kindled against Moses, and He said, Is there not Aaron, thy brother, the Levite? I know that speaking he will speak. And also behold he goeth forth to meet thee; and he will see thee, and he will be 
glad in his heart.      15. And thou shalt speak unto him, and shalt put the words in his mouth; and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.      16. And 
he shall speak for thee unto the people; and it shall be that he shall be to thee for a mouth, and thou shalt be to him for God.      17. And thou shalt take in thy hand this rod, wherewith thou shalt 
do the signs.      18. And Moses went, and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, Let me go, I pray, and return unto my brethren who are in Egypt, and I shall see whether they yet live. 
And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.      19. And Jehovah said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt; because all the men seeking thy soul are dead.      20. And Moses took his wife and 
his sons, and made them ride upon the ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt; and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.      21. And Jehovah said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, 
see all the wonders which I have put in thy hand, and thou shalt do them before Pharaoh; and I will harden his heart, and he will not send away the people.      22. And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, 
Thus said Jehovah, My son, My firstborn, is Israel.      23. And I say unto thee, Send My son away, that he may serve Me; and if thou refuse to send him away, behold I will slay thy son, thy firstborn.  
    24. And it came to pass in the way, in the inn, that Jehovah met him, and sought to kill him.      25. And Zipporah took a stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and made it touch his 
feet; and she said, Because a bridegroom of bloods art thou to me.      26. And He ceased from him. Then she said, A bridegroom of bloods as to circumcisions.      27. And Jehovah said unto Aaron, Go 
to meet Moses, into the wilderness. And he went, and met him in the mountain of God, and kissed him.      28. And Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah, wherewith He had sent him, and all the signs 
which He had commanded him.      29. And Moses went, and Aaron, and gathered together all the elders of the sons of Israel.      30. And Aaron spoke all the words which Jehovah had spoken unto 
Moses, and did the signs before the eyes of the people.      31. And the people believed; and they heard that Jehovah had visited the sons of Israel, and that He had seen their affliction, and they bent 
themselves, and bowed themselves down. </p>

What applies to wealth applies no less to important positions in the world. Anyone may procure these for himself, but for his neighbour's benefit, not for his own. Whoever does so for his own benefit 
provides badly for himself, whereas he who does so for his neighbour's benefit provides well for himself; for the person who turns his ends in his own direction turns towards hell, whereas one who turns 
away from himself in his neighbour's direction turns towards heaven. </p>

dixit, Et ecce non credent mihi, et non audient vocem meam, quia dicent, Non visus ad te JEHOVAH. 	2.  Et dixit ad illum JEHOVAH, Quid istud in manu tua? et dixit, Baculus. 	3.  Et dixit, Projice illum 
terram; et projecit illum terram, et factus in serpentem, et fugit Moscheh a coram eo. 	4.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Moschen, Mitte manum tuam, et prehende caudam ejus; et misit manum suam, et apprehendit 
eum, et factus in baculum in vola illius. 	5.  Propterea ut credant quod visus ad te JEHOVAH, DEUS patrum eorum, DEUS Abrahami, DEUS Jischaki, et DEUS Jacobi. 	6.  Et dixit JEHOVAH illi adhuc, 
Adduc nunc manum tuam in sinum tuum; et adduxit manum suam in sinum suum, et eduxit illam, et ecce manus ejus leprosa sicut nix. 	7.  Et dixit, Reduc manum tuam ad sinum tuum; et reduxit manum suam 
ad sinum suum, et eduxit illam e sinu suo, et ecce reversa sicut caro illius. 	8.  Et erit, si non credunt tibi, et non audiunt vocem signi prioris, et credent voci signi posterioris. 	9.  Et erit, 
si non credunt etiam binis signis illis, et non audiunt vocem tuam, et accipias de aquis fluvii, et effundas in aridam, et erunt aquae quas accepisti e fluvio, et erunt in sanguinem in arida. 	10.  Et 
dixit Moscheh ad JEHOVAM, In me, DOMINE, non vir verborum ego, etiam ab heri, etiam a nudius tertius, etiam a nunc loqui Te ad servum Tuum, quia gravis ore, et gravis lingua ego. 	11.  Et dixit JEHOVAH 
ad illum, Quis ponit os homini, aut quis posuit mutum, aut surdum, aut videntem {1}, aut caecum, nonne Ego JEHOVAH? 	@1 i (vide Hebr:)$ 	12.  Et nunc vade, et Ego ero cum ore tuo, et docebo te 
quae loqueris. 	13.  Et dixit, In me, DOMINE, mitte quaeso, per manum mittas. 	14.  Et accensa ira JEHOVAE in Moschen, et dixit, Annon Aharon frater tuus Levita? novi quod loquendo loquetur (x)ille; 
et etiam ecce ille exit obviam tibi, et videbit te, et laetabitur in corde suo. 	15.  Et loquaris ad illum, et ponas verba in ore illius, et Ego ero cum ore tuo, et cum ore ejus, et docebo vos quae 
facietis. 	16.  Et loquetur ille tibi ad populum, et fiet, ille erit tibi ad os, et tu eris illi ad deum. 	17.  Et baculum hunc accipias in manu tua, quo facies signa. 	18.  Et ivit Moscheh, et reversus 
ad Jethronem socerum suum, et dixit ei, Ibo quaeso, et revertar ad fratres meos qui in Aegypto, et videbo num adhuc illi vivunt; et dixit Jethro Moschi, Vade in pace. 	19.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad 
Moschen in Midian, Vade, revertere Aegyptum, quia mortui sunt omnes viri {1} quaerentes animam tuam. 	@1 i (viri anaschim).  Anaschim is a transliteration of Heb.      , plural of     ('ish), usually 
rendered by S as vir; Heb      (adham) is usually rendered as homo.$ 	20.  Et accepit Moscheh uxorem suam, et filios suos, et equitare fecit illos super asino, et reversus terram Aegypti; et accepit 
Moscheh baculum DEI in manu sua. 	21.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Moschen, In eundo te ad revertendum Aegyptum, vide omnia portenta quae posui in manu tua, et facias illa coram Pharaone; et Ego obfirmabo cor 
illius, et non mittet populum. 	22.  Et dicas ad Pharaonem, Ita dixit JEHOVAH, Filius Meus, primogenitus Meus, Israel. 	23.  Et dico ad te, Dimitte filium Meum, et (x)serviat Mihi, et renuis dimittere 
illum, ecce Ego occido filium tuum, primogenitum tuum. 	24.  Et fuit in via in diversorio, et occurrit illi JEHOVAH, et quaesivit occidere illum. 	25.  Et accepit Zippora petram, et abscidit praeputium 
filii sui, et tangere fecit pedes ejus, et dixit, Quod sponsus sanguinum tu mihi. 	26.  Et cessavit ab illo; tunc dixit, Sponsus sanguinum ad circumcisiones. 	27.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Aharonem, 
Vade obviam Moschi desertum; et ivit, et occurrit illi in monte DEI, et osculatus illum. 	28.  Et indicavit Moscheh Aharoni omnia verba JEHOVAE, quibus misit illum, et omnia signa quae praecepit 
illi. 	29.  Et ivit Moscheh et Aharon, et congregaverunt omnes seniores filiorum Israelis. 	30.  Et locutus Aharon omnia verba quae locutus JEHOVAH ad Moschen, et fecit signa ad oculos populi. 	31. 
 Et credidit populus, et audiverunt quod visitaverit JEHOVAH filios Israelis, et quod viderit afflictionem illorum; et inflexerunt se et incurvaverunt se. </p>
