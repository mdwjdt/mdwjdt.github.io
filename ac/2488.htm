<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2489.</strong>内部记忆里的事物在来世会通过某种气场显现，通过该气场从远处就能知道灵人的本性，也就是知道他们情感和信念的性质。这种气场是从内部记忆里的事物的活动发出的（关于这些气场，可参看<a href="1048.htm">1048</a>，<a href="1053.htm">1053</a>，<a href="1316.htm">1316</a>，<a href="1504.htm">1504</a>等等）。</p>

Before I had been instructed by living experience, I had supposed, as do others, that no spirit could possibly know the things in my memory and in my thought; but that they were solely in my possession, 
and were hidden. But I can assert that the spirits with man know and take note of the smallest things of his memory and thoughts; and this much more clearly than the man himself; and that the angels 
know and take note of the ends themselves, how they bend themselves from good to evil, and from evil to good; and of many more things than the man knows; such as those which he has immersed in his 
delights, and thus as it were in his nature and disposition; for when this is done such things no longer appear, because he no longer reflects upon them. Let no man therefore any longer believe that his 
thoughts are hidden, and that he is not to render an account of his thoughts, and of his deeds according to the degree and the quality of the thoughts that have been in them; for the deeds have their 
quality from the thoughts, and the thoughts from the ends. </p>

Before I had learned otherwise through actual experiences, I like others had imagined that no spirit could possibly know the contents of my memory and of my thought, but that these were solely my own 
and hidden away. But I can positively declare that the spirits present with a person know about and detect the smallest contents of his memory and thoughts, doing so far more clearly than man himself 
does. And angels know and detect the ends in view there - how they bend from good to evil, and from evil to good, and many things more than man knows of, such as the things which he immerses in his pleasures, 
and thus so to speak in his nature and disposition. And when this happens they are no longer apparent because he does not reflect on them any more. Let no one from now on suppose therefore that 
his thoughts lie hidden away and that he will not have to account for his thoughts, or for his deeds insofar as these have his thoughts within them and are qualified by them. For the true nature of 
deeds is determined by the thoughts, and the thoughts by the ends in view. </p>

Autumavi, antequam per vivas experientias instructus fui, ego sicut alii, quod nusquam aliquis spiritus posset scire quae in memoria mea, et quae in cogitatione, (m)sed quod illa solam penes me essent, 
et abscondita; (n)sed asseverare possum quod spiritus qui apud hominem, minima ejus memoriae et cogitationum sciant et animadvertant, et hoc multo clarius quam ipse homo; et quod angeli ipsos fines, 
quomodo se flectunt a bono in malum, et a malo in bonam, et multo plura quam homo novit, prout illa quae immersit jucundis, et sic quasi natura et indoli {1}, quod cum fit, non amplius apparent quia 
supra ea non amplius reflectit. Ne itaque credat homo amplius quod cogitationes ejus sint occultae, et quod non cogitationum rationem redditurus, et factorum {2} quantam et quale cogitationum in illis 
fuerunt; facta enim a cogitationibus (habent suum quale, et cogitationes a finibus. 	@1 naturae et indolis.$ 	@2 ipsa cogitata sunt quae aperiuntur in altera vita, et facta. Facta was later changed 
to factorum.$ </p>
