<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3461.</strong>创世记26:32，33.那一天，以撒的仆人来，将他们挖井的事告诉他，对他说，我们找到水了。他就给那井起名叫示巴，因此那城名叫别是巴，直到今日。<br />“那一天”表那状态。“以撒的仆人来”表理性事物。“将他们挖井的事告诉他，对他说，我们找到水了”表通过这些事物所获得的内层真理。“他就给那井起名叫示巴”表确认的真理藉着它们的结合。“因此那城名叫别是巴”表由那结合所产生的教义的本质。“直到今日”表状态的永久性。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3461</b></p><p><b>3461.</b>
Verses 32, 33. And it came to pass in that day that the servants of Isaac came and showed him concerning the well which they had digged; and they said unto him, We have found waters. And he called it 
Shibah; therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day. "And it came to pass in that day," signifies that state; "that the servants of Isaac came," signifies things rational; "and showed him 
concerning the well which they had digged; and they said unto him, We have found waters," signifies interior truths by means of these things; "and he called it Shibah," signifies the conjunction of 
confirmed truth thereby; "therefore the name of the city is Beersheba," signifies the quality of the derivative doctrine; "unto this day," signifies the perpetuity of the state. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3461</b></p><p><b>3461.</b>
Verses 32, 33 And so it was on that day, that Isaac's servants came and pointed out to him the reasons for the well which they had dug, and they said to him, We have found water. And he called it Shibah; 
therefore the name of the city is Beersheba even to this day. </p>
<p>'So it was on that day' means that state. 'That Isaac's servants came' means rational concepts. 'And pointed out to him the reasons 
for the well which they had dug; and they said to him, We have found water' means interior truths obtained by means of these. 'And he called it Shibah' means the conjunction of confirmed truth by means 
of them. 'Therefore the name of the city is Beersheba' means the essential nature of the doctrine resulting from that conjunction. 'Even to this day' means the perpetuity of the state. </p>

</p><b>3461.</b>
Vers. 32, 33.  Et fuit in die illo, et venerunt servi Jishaki, et indicaverint ei super causas putei quem foderunt, et dixerunt ei, Invenimus aquas. Et vocavit eum Shibba, propterea nomen urbis Beersheba, 
usque ad diem hunc. `Fuit in die illo' significat statum illum: et venerunt servi Jishaki' significat rationalia: `et indicaverunt ei super causas putei quem foderunt, et dixerunt ei, Invenimus 
aquas' significat vera interiora per illa: `et vocavit (c)eum Shibba' significat confirmati veri conjunctionem per illa:  `propterea nomen urbis Beersheba' significat doctrinae quale inde: `usque ad 
diem hunc' significat status perpetuum. </p>
