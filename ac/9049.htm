<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9049节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9049.</strong>“就要以命偿命”表秩序的律法，即你愿邻舍怎样待你，就怎样待邻舍，因此，你向别人所行的，都会行在你身上。这从以下事实清楚可知：“以命偿命，以眼还眼，以牙还牙”等等，表示你向别人所行的，都会行在你身上。这条律法之所以被赋予以色列人，是因为这也是灵界的律法。在灵界，凡发自内心向别人行善的人都会得到同样的良善；所以凡发自内心向别人行恶的人也会得到同样的邪恶。因为发自内心所行的良善都带有自己的赏赐，而发自内心所行的邪恶则带有自己的惩罚。因此，天堂是对善人的赏赐，地狱是对恶人的惩罚。我通过大量经历得以知道这是事实。此中情形是这样：对发自内心行善的人来说，良善从天堂的四面八方流入他的内心和灵魂，大大激励他去做他所做的事。同时对邻舍，就是他行善的对象的爱与情感在增长，伴随这爱与情感的无法形容的天堂快乐也在增长。这一切之所以发生，是因为在天堂，来自主的爱之良善处处掌权，照着它被给予别人的程度而不断流入。发自内心向别人行恶的人也一样。四面八方的邪恶从地狱流入他的内心，大大刺激他去做他所做的事。同时，爱与情感在增长，伴随它们的对那些不服从他之人的仇恨和报复的快乐也在增长。这一切之所以发生，是因为在地狱，爱自己的邪恶处处掌权，照着它被给予别人的程度而不断流入。当这种情况发生时，惩罚者立刻出现，他们会粗暴对待作恶者。邪恶及其快乐以这种方式得到控制。<br />这些事情之所以如此，是因为来世的秩序律法不像在世人中间那样，是从书本上学来的，然后存在记忆中。相反，它们是写在心上的律法，邪恶的律法写在恶人的心上，良善的律法写在善人的心上。因为每个人都将他通过世上的生活而系在心上的东西带到来世；也就是说，恶人带着邪恶，善人则带着良善。<br />这些事所遵循的秩序律法就是主在马太福音中所教导的：<br />无论何事，你们愿意人怎样待你们，你们也要怎样待人，因为这就是律法和先知。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.12.htm">7:12</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路6.31.htm">6:31</a>）<br />秩序来自从主发出的神性真理。在天堂，秩序的律法就是源于良善的真理；而在地狱，它们则是与良善分离的真理。说它们分离不是由于主，而是由于人。当良善未被接受时，它就被分离了。<br />被称为“报应法”的律法在利未记中被描述如下：<br />打死牲畜性命的，必赔上牲畜，以命偿命。人若在他邻舍身上造成残疾，他怎样行，也要照样向他行：以骨还骨，以眼还眼，以牙还牙。他怎样在人身上造成残疾，也要照样向他行。打死牲畜的，必赔上牲畜；打死人的，必被处死。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利24.18.htm">24:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利24.21.htm">21</a>）<br />由于邪恶自带惩罚，所以主说“不可抵抗邪恶”。同时，在以下马太福音中的话中，祂解释了在灵界，对与陷入邪恶的人相处的那些处于良善的人来说，这条律法意味着什么：<br />你们听见有话说，以眼还眼，以牙还牙。只是我告诉你们，不要抵抗恶人。有人打你的右颊，连左颊也转过来由他打；有人想要告你，要拿你的里衣，连外衣也由他拿去；有人强逼你走一里路，你就同他走二里；有求你的，就给他；有向你借贷的，不可推辞。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.38.htm">5:38</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.42.htm">42</a>）<br />谁看不出这些话不可照字义来理解？谁会把左颊转过来给那打他右颊的？谁会把外衣给那想要拿他里衣的？谁会把自己所有的给凡求它的？谁不抵抗邪恶？若不知道“右颊”、“左颊”、“里衣”、“外衣”，以及“一里”、“借贷”等等表示什么，没有人能明白这些话。这几节所论述的主题是属灵的生活，或信之生活，而不是属世的生活，也就是世上的生活。主在这一章和下一章揭开属于天堂的内层事物，不过，是通过存在于世上的那类事物揭开的。祂利用这类事物，是为了叫属世界的人不明白，只叫属天堂的人明白。之所以不叫属世界的人明白，是为了防止他们亵渎圣言的内层事物；因为他们若如此行，就会把自己扔进最可怕的地狱，也就是亵渎圣言者的地狱。这解释了为何主在路加福音中说：<br />神国的奥秘只叫你们知道；至于其他的人，就用比喻，叫他们看也看不见，听也听不明。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.10.htm">8:10</a>）<br />约翰福音：<br />以赛亚书说，主叫他们瞎了眼、硬了心，免得他们眼睛看见，心里明白，回转过来，我医治他们。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.39.htm">12:39</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.40.htm">40</a>）<br />经上说“免得我医治他们”，是因为那些得了医治，又回到虚假和邪恶的人就会犯亵渎罪。他们就是马太福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.43.htm">12:43</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.45.htm">45</a>）中所指的人。<br />但必须说明上面所引用的主的话在内义上表示什么。就内义而言，他们 是指那些想要利用虚假摧毁信之真理，也就是摧毁当一个人正在经历试探或遭受迫害时与他同在、当善灵受到恶灵侵扰时与他们同在的属灵生命之人。“脸颊”表示对内层真理的情感，“右颊”是指对源于良善的真理的情感；“打”表示伤害这种情感的行为；“里衣”和“外衣”表示外在形式的真理（<a href="4677.htm">4677</a>，<a href="4741.htm">4741</a>，<a href="4742.htm">4742</a>节）；“告”表示努力或试探摧毁；“一里”表示通向真理的东西，因为“一里”和“路”所表相同，“路”表示通向真理的东西（参看<a href="627.htm">627</a>，<a href="2333.htm">2333</a>，<a href="3477.htm">3477</a>节）；“借给”表示告知。由此明显可知“凡有求的，就给他”表示什么，即表示公布构成人对主之信的一切。因此，“不可抵抗邪恶”的原因是，邪恶对那些处于真理和良善的人根本造不成任何伤害，因为他们受到主的保护。<br />这些就是隐藏在主所说的这些话之下的东西；正因如此，主只是简单地说，“你们听见有话说，以眼还眼，以牙还牙”，没有再多说什么；因为“眼”表示信的内层真理，“牙”表示信的外层真理，这从下文可以看出来。这一切表明主在世时以什么样的方式说话，即：就像在旧约圣言的各个地方一样，祂同时为天上的天使和世人说话。事实上，祂的话语本身是神性，是属天堂的，因为它源于神性，并由经天堂而来。不过，为了呈现祂所说的真理，祂使用了诸如世上与它们相对应的那类事物。内义则教导了这类事物所对应的东西。<br />“打下颚”或“打脸颊”表示摧毁真理，这一点从圣言中提到“打脸颊或下颚”的地方明显看出来。由于它在真正的意义上表示真理的毁灭，故在相反的意义上表示虚假的毁灭；在这个意义上，它出现在以下经文中：<br />你必击打我一切仇敌的脸颊，敲碎恶人的牙齿。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗3.7.htm">3:7</a>）<br />弥迦书：<br />他们要用杖击打以色列审判者的脸颊。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥5.1.htm">5:1</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />使人错行的嚼环必在众民的脸颊上。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.28.htm">30:28</a>）<br />“脸”表示情感（<a href="4796.htm">4796</a>，<a href="4797.htm">4797</a>，<a href="4799.htm">4799</a>，<a href="5102.htm">5102</a>，<a href="5695.htm">5695</a>，<a href="6604.htm">6604</a>节）。因此，脸的各个部分表示诸如属于情感，并与它们的功能和用途相对应的那类事物；如“眼睛”表示对真理的理解，“鼻子”表示对真理的感知；嘴的各个部分，如“下颚”、“嘴唇”或“舌头”表示诸如属于真理话语的那类事物（<a href="4796.htm">4796</a>-<a href="4805.htm">4805</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9049</b></p><p><b>9049.</b>
Then thou shalt give soul for soul. That this signifies the law of order that thou shalt do to thy neighbor as thou wouldest have another do to thee, consequently that what thou doest to another shall 
be done to thee, is evident from the fact that "to give soul for soul, eye for eye, tooth for tooth," and so forth, denotes that as thou hast done to another so shall it be done to thee. The reason 
why this law was given to the sons of Israel, is that such is the law in the spiritual world. He who there does good to another from the heart, receives the like good. Consequently he who does evil to 
another from the heart, receives the like evil. For good that is from the heart is conjoined with its reward, and evil that is from the heart is conjoined with its punishment; consequently there is heaven 
for the good, and hell for the evil. That this is so, it has been given me to know from much experience. The case herein is this. With him who does good from the heart, there inflows from heaven 
on every side, good into the heart and soul of him who does it, and by inspiring inspires it; and then at the same time the affection of love for the neighbor to whom he does good is increased, and with 
this affection a delight which is heavenly and unutterable. The cause of this is that in heaven the good of love from the Lord reigns universally, and constantly flows in according to the degree in 
which it is practiced toward another. The case is similar in respect to evil. With him who from the heart does evil to another, there inflows from hell on every side evil into the heart of him who does 
it, and by exciting excites it; and then at the same time the affection of the love of self is increased, and with it the delight of hatred and revenge against those who do not submit themselves. 
The cause of this is that in hell the evil of the love of self reigns universally, and constantly flows in according to the degree in which it is practiced toward another. When this occurs, the punishers 
are at once present, who ill-treat the offender; and thereby the evil with its delight is restrained. [2] These things are so for the reason that the laws of order in the other life are not learned 
from books, and stored up therefrom in the memory, as with men in the world, but are written on hearts, the laws of evil on the heart of the evil, and the laws of good on the heart of the good. For 
every man carries with him into the other life that which by his life in the world he had set in his heart; namely, evil with the evil; and good with the good. [3] The law of order from which these 
things flow is that which the Lord taught in Matthew: </p>
<p>     All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them; this is the law and the prophets (Matt. 7:12; Luke 6:31). Order 
is from the Divine truth which proceeds from the Lord. The laws of order in heaven are truths from good, and in hell are truths separated from good. They are said to be separated, not by reason 
of the Lord, but by reason of man. Good is separated by the nonreception of it. [4] The law which is called "the law of retaliation," is thus described in Leviticus: </p>
<p>     He that smiteth the soul of 
a beast shall restore it, soul for soul; if a man shall cause a blemish in his neighbor; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him; breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he shall cause 
a blemish in a man, so shall it be rendered unto him. He that smiteth a beast shall restore it; and he that smiteth a man shall be killed (Lev. 24:18-21). As evil carries with it its penalty, it is 
therefore said by the Lord that "evil must not be resisted," and at the same time in the following words in Matthew it is explained how the case is with this law in the spiritual world, with those who 
are in good, relatively to those who are in evil: </p>
<p>     Ye have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth; but I say unto you, Resist not evil; but whosoever shall strike thee 
on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if any man would drag thee to law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. And whosoever shall compel thee to go one mile, go with him 
twain. Give to everyone that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away (Matt. 5:38-42). [5] Who cannot see that these words are not to be understood according to the sense 
of the letter? For who will turn the left cheek to him who deals a blow on the right cheek? And who will give his cloak to him who would take away his coat? And who will give his property to all 
who ask? And who will not resist evil? But no one can understand these words who does not know what is signified by "the right cheek" and "the left cheek," what by "a coat" and "a cloak," also what by 
"a mile," and likewise by "borrowing," and so on. The subject there treated of is spiritual life, or the life of faith; not natural life, which is the life of the world. The Lord there opens, and also 
in this chapter, and the following, the interior things that belong to heaven, but by means of such things as are in the world. The reason why He did so by such things, was that not worldly men, but 
only heavenly men, should understand. The reason why worldly men were not to understand, was lest they should profane the interior things of the Word, for by so doing they would cast themselves into 
the most frightful hell of all, which is the hell of the profaners of the Word. Therefore it is said by the Lord in Luke: </p>
<p>     Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God; but to 
the rest in parables; that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not hear (Luke 8:10). And in John: </p>
<p>     Isaiah said, He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they may not 
see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and should convert themselves, and I should heal them (John 12:39, 40). It is said "lest I should heal them," because they who are healed and return 
again to falsities and evils, commit profanation. These are they who are meant in Matthew 12:43-45. [6] But it shall now be told what is meant in the internal sense by the words of the Lord above 
quoted. In this sense it there treats of those who wish to destroy by means of falsities the truths of faith, thus the spiritual life with a man when he is in temptations, and in persecutions; and in 
good spirits when they are in infestations by evil spirits. By "the cheek" is signified the affection of interior truth, by "the right cheek" the affection of truth from good; by "dealing a blow" is 
signified the act of injuring this affection; by "coat" and "cloak" is signified truth in the external form (n. 4677, 4741, 4742); by "dragging to law" is signified the endeavor to destroy; by "a mile" 
is signified that which leads to truth, for the like is signified by "a mile" as by "a way" (that "a way" denotes that which leads to truth, see n. 627, 2333, 3477); by "lending" is signified to instruct. 
From this it is plain what is signified by "giving to all who ask," namely, to confess all things of one's faith in the Lord. The reason therefore why evil ought not to be resisted, is that evil 
does no harm to those who are in truth and good, for they are protected by the Lord. [7] These are the things which have been hidden under the above words of the Lord; and this being the case, the 
Lord only says, "Ye have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth," but says no more; because by "an eye" is signified the interior truth of faith; and by "a tooth," the exterior 
truth of faith, as will be seen in what follows. From all this it is evident in what manner the Lord spoke when He was in the world, namely, that He spoke, as everywhere in the Word of the Old Testament, 
at the same time for the angels in heaven, and for men in the world; for His speech was in itself Divine and heavenly, because it was from the Divine, and through heaven. But the things which 
He spoke were presented by means of such things as corresponded in the world. What they correspond to, the internal sense teaches. [8] That "to deal a blow" or "to smite the cheek" denotes to destroy 
truths, is plain from passages in the Word where mention is made of "smiting the cheek." And because in the genuine sense this signifies the destruction of truth, therefore in the opposite sense it 
signifies the destruction of falsity, in which sense it occurs in these passages: </p>
<p>     Thou wilt smite all mine enemies on the cheek; Thou wilt break the teeth of the wicked (Ps. 3:7).      They shall 
smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek (Mic. 5:1).      The bridle of him that leadeth astray shall be on the cheeks of the peoples (Isa. 30:28). For "the face" signifies the affections 
(n. 4796, 4797, 4799, 5102, 5695, 6604), consequently those things which belong to the face signify such things as belong to the affections, and correspond to their functions and uses; as the "eye" 
signifies the understanding of truth, the "nostrils" the perception of truth, those things which belong to the mouth, as the "jaws," the "lips," the "tongue," signify such things as relate to the utterance 
of truth (n. 4796-4805). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9049</b></p><p><b>9049.</b>
'You shall pay soul for soul' means the law of order that you shall do to your neighbour as you wish him to do to you, and therefore that it shall be done to you as you do to another. This is clear from 
the fact that paving soul for soul, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, and so on, means having clone to you what you would do to another. The reason why this law was given to the children of Israel was 
that a similar law exists in the spiritual world. Anyone there who does good to another with all his heart receives good in like measure; and therefore one who does evil to another with all his heart 
receives evil in like measure. For good done with all one's heart carries its own reward together with it, and evil done with all one's heart carries its own punishment together with it So it is that 
heaven is the reward for good people, and hell the punishment for evil ones. Considerable experience has allowed me to know that this is so. The situation with both groups is as follows With someone 
who does good with all his heart good is flowing in from heaven on every side into his heart and soul and inspiring him greatly to act as he does. At the same time love and affection for the neighbour 
to whom he does the good is increasing, and with this love and affection a delight that is heavenly delight, beyond description. The reason why all this happens is that the good of love from the Lord 
reigns everywhere in heaven, flowing in unceasingly in the same measure as it is being given out to another. Similarly with someone evil who does evil to another with all his heart. Evil on every side 
is flowing in from hell into his heart and spurring him on greatly to act as he does. At the same time selfish love and affection is increasing, and with them the delight born of hatred and vengeance 
against those unsubmissive to him. The reason why all this happens is that the evil of self-love reigns everywhere in hell, flowing in unceasingly in the same measure as it is given out to another. 
When this happens those who punish are immediately present, and they deal roughly with the evil-doer. In this way evil along with its delight is kept in check. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 These things are so because the laws 
of order in the next life are not learned from books and then stored away in the memory, as they are with people in the world. Rather they are laws written on the heart, laws of evil on the heart 
of those who are evil, and laws of good on the heart of those who are good. For everyone takes with him into the next life that which has been fixed in his heart by his life in the world, that is to say 
evil in the case of evil people and good in the case of good ones. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The law of order from which these things follow is that which the Lord has taught in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
All things whatever you wish 
people to do to you, do also to them; this is the Law and the Prophets. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%207:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 7:12</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%206:31&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 6:31</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Order arises out of Divine Truth which comes from the Lord. In heaven the laws of order are truths 
springing from good, but in hell they are truths separated from good. They are said to be separated not on account of what the Lord does but of what man does. Good is separated when it is unreceived. 
 </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The law called the law of retaliation is set out in Leviticus as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
Whoever strikes the soul of a beast shall make restitution, soul for soul. If a man has caused disfigurement in his 
neighbour as he has done, so shall it be done to him - fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. As he has caused disfigurement in a person, so shall it be paid out to him. One striking a 
beast shall make restitution, and one striking a human being shall be killed. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2024:17-21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 24:17-21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Since evil carries its own punishment with it the Lord says that one should not resist evil. At the same 
time He explains what this law means for those in the spiritual world who are governed by good, in their relations with those ruled by evil, in the following words in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
You have heard that 
it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. But I say, Evil is not to be resisted. But whoever smacks you on your right jaw, turn the other to him also. And if anyone wishes to drag you to 
court and take away your tunic, let him have your cloak also. Whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two. Give to everyone asking from you, and from him desiring to receive a loan from you, 
do not turn away. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%205:38-42&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 5:38-42</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Who can fail to see that these words should not be taken literally? Who is going to turn his left jaw to one who has smacked him on the right jaw? Who is going 
to give his cloak to one who wishes to take away his tunic? Who is going to give what he has to all who ask for it? And who will not resist evil? But these words cannot be understood by anyone who does 
not know what the right jaw and the left, tunic and cloak, a mile, a loan, and all the rest are being used to mean. The subject in these verses is spiritual life or the life of faith, not natural life, 
which is the life of the world. In this chapter and the next the Lord reveals things of a more internal nature that belong to heaven; but He has done so by means of the kinds of things that exist 
in the world. He used such things in order that worldly-minded people might not understand them, only heavenly-minded people. And the reason why the worldly- minded people should be prevented from understanding 
was so that they would not profane the more internal truths of the Word; for by profaning these truths those people would cast themselves into the most horrible hell of all, which is the hell 
of profaners of the Word. This explains why the Lord has said in Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to everyone else in parables, that seeing they may 
not see, and hearing they may not hear. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%208:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 8:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in John, </p>
<blockquote>
Isaiah said, He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, lest they should see with their eyes and understand with their 
heart, and should be converted and I should heal them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2012:40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 12:40</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>It says 'lest I heal them' because those who are healed but then go back to falsities and evils commit profanation. These are the 
ones who are meant in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matthew%2012:43-45&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matthew 12:43-45</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 But what the Lord's words quoted above are used to mean in the internal sense must be stated now. They refer in the internal sense to those who wish to 
use falsities to destroy the truths of faith, that is, to destroy the spiritual life with a person when he is undergoing temptation, or suffering persecution, and with good spirits when they are subject 
to molestations from evil spirits. 'The jaw' means an affection for interior truth, 'the right jaw' being an affection for truth derived from good; 'smacking' means the act of injuring that affection; 
'tunic' and 'cloak' mean truth in an outward form, <a href="4677.htm">4677</a>, <a href="4741.htm">4741</a>, <a href="4742.htm">4742</a>; 'dragging to court' means trying to destroy; 'mile' means that which leads to truth, for 'mire' is similar in meaning to 'way', 
which means that which leads to truth, see <a href="627.htm">627</a>, <a href="2333.htm">2333</a>, <a href="3477.htm">3477</a>; and 'giving a loan' means informing, which shows what 'giving to all who ask' means, namely declaring everything composing one's belief in 
the Lord. The reason therefore why 'evil should not be resisted' is that evil can have no harmful effect at all on those governed by truth and good, for they are protected by the Lord. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 These are 
the things that lie concealed beneath those words spoken by the Lord, which being so, the Lord says simply, 'You have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth', quoting no 
further than this. He goes no further because 'an eye' means more internal truth of faith, and 'a tooth' more external truth of faith, as will be seen below. This shows in what way the Lord used words 
when He was in the world, that is to say, in the same way as they were used everywhere in the Old Testament Word - at the same time both for angels in heaven and for people in the world. For in itself 
His speech was Divine and heavenly, since it sprang from the Divine and came by way of heaven. But to present the truths He spoke He used such things as corresponded to them in the world. What such 
things correspond to is taught by the internal sense. </p>

 The fact that 'smacking the jaw' or striking it means destroying truths is evident from places in the Word in which the expression 'striking 
the jaw' is used. And since in the genuine sense it means the destruction of truth, in the contrary sense it means the destruction of falsity, in which sense it occurs in David, </p>
<blockquote>
You will strike all 
my enemies on the jaw, You will break the teeth of the wicked. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%203:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 3:7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Micah, </p>
<blockquote>
With a rod they will strike the judge of Israel on the jaw. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Micah%205:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Micah 5:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The bridle of one 
that leads astray will be on the jaws of peoples. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2030:28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 30:28</a>.

<p>'The face' means the affections, <a href="4796.htm">4796</a>, <a href="4797.htm">4797</a>, <a href="4799.htm">4799</a>, <a href="5102.htm">5102</a>, <a href="5695.htm">5695</a>, <a href="6604.htm">6604</a>. Consequently parts of the face mean such things as belong to the affections 
and correspond to the functions and uses they perform. The eye for example corresponds to the understanding of truth, the nostrils to the perception of truth, and parts of the mouth - the jaws, 
lips, throat, or tongue - to such things as belong to the utterance of truth, <a href="4796.htm">4796</a> <a href="4805.htm">4805</a>. </p>

{1}  `Et dabis animam pro anima': quod significet legem ordinis, quod ita facies proximo sicut vis ut {2}ille tibi faciat, proinde quod {3}tibi fiet quod alteri facis, constat ex eo quod dare animam pro 
anima, oculum pro oculo, dentem pro dente, et sic porro, sit fieri {3}tibi sicut feceras alteri.  Quod haec lex data sit filiis Israelis, erat quia lex talis est in mundo spirituali; qui ibi bonum 
facit alteri ex corde, bonum simile recipit; {4}inde qui malum facit alteri ex corde, malum simile recipit; bonum enim ex corde conjunctum est cum sua remuneratione, et malum ex corde conjunctum est cum 
sua punitione, inde est caelum bonis, et infernum malis; quod ita sit, ex multa experientia scire datum est; cum illis sic se habet: qui bonum facit ex corde, influit e caelo ab undequaque {5}bonum 
in cor et animam ejus qui facit, ac id inspirat inspirando, et augetur tunc simul affectio amoris pro proximo cui bonum facit, {6}et cum illa affectione jucundum {7}, quod est jucundum caeleste, ineffabile; 
causa quod ita fiat, est quia bonum amoris a Domino est in caelo universaliter regnans, (c)ac influit jugiter secundum gradum quo expromitur in alterum; similiter se habet cum malo qui malum 
alteri ex corde facit, influit ex inferno malum ab undequaque in cor ejus qui facit ac id excitat excitando; augetur tunc simul affectio amoris sui, et cum illo jucundum odii ac vindictae contra illos 
qui se non submittunt; causa quod ita fiat, est quia malum amoris sui est in inferno universaliter regnans, et influit jugiter secundum gradum quo expromitur in alterum; cum hoc fit, statim adsunt punitores 
qui illum male tractant; per hoc, malum cum suo jucundo coercetur. 2 Haec inde sunt quia leges ordinis in altera vita non sunt doctae ex libris et inde repositae in memoria, sicut apud homines 
in mundo, sed sunt inscriptae cordibus, {8}leges mali in corde malorum, et leges boni in corde bonorum, nam unusquisque homo {9} in alteram vitam secum portat id quod per vitam in mundo indiderat cordi 
suo, nempe malum apud malos et bonum apud bonos. 3 Lex ordinis ex qua illa fluunt, est quam Dominus docuit apud Matthaeum, Omnia quaecumque volueritis ut faciant vobis homines, sic et vos facite 
illis; haec est Lex et Prophetae, vii 12; Luc. vi (x)31;  ordo est {10} Divino Vero quod procedit a Domino; leges ordinis sunt vera ex bono in caelo, et vera separata a bono in inferno; separata dicuntur, 
non (c)ex Domino sed (c)ex homine; {11} separatur bonum per non receptionem ejus. 4 Lex {12} quae lex juris talionis vocatur ita describitur in Levitico, Qui percusserit animam bestiae restituet 
eam, animam pro anima; si vir dederit defectum in proximo suo, quemadmodum fecit sic fiet illi, fractura pro fractura, oculus pro oculo, dens pro dente; quemadmodum defectum dederit in homine, 
sic dabitur in illo; percutiens bestiam restituet eam, et percutiens hominem occidetur, xxiv 17-21. Quia malum habet secum poenam, ideo {13}dicitur a Domino quod `non resistendum sit malo'; et simul 
explicatur quomodo cum hac lege se habet in mundo spirituali apud illos qui in bono sunt respective ad illos qui in malo, his verbis apud Matthaeum, Audivistis quod dictum sit, Oculum pro oculo, 
et dentem pro dente; Ego vero dico, Non resistendum esse malo; sed quicumque impegerit tibi alapam in dextram tuam maxillam, obverte illi etiam alteram; et si quis velit te in jus trahere et tunicam tuam 
auferre, permitte etiam illi pallium; quisquis adegerit te ad miliare unum, abito cum illo duo; (x)omni a te petenti dato, et cupientem mutuum accipere a te, ne averseris, (x)v 38-41 [,42]; </p>
<p>quis 
non videre potest quod haec verba non secundum sensum litterae 5 sint intelligenda? nam quis obversurus est maxillam sinistram ei qui impegerit alapam in maxillam dextram? et quis daturus pallium ei qui 
vult auferre tunicam? et quis daturus sua omnibus qui petunt? et quis malo non resistet? sed haec nemo intelligere potest qua non scit quid significat maxilla dextra et sinistra, quid tunica et pallium, 
tum quid miliare, ut et mutuum, cum reliquis; {14}agitur ibi de vita spirituali seu de vita fidei, non de vita naturali, quae est vita mundi; aperit {15}ibi Dominus in hoc capite et in sequenti 
interiora quae caeli sunt, sed per talia quae in mundo; quod per talia, erat causa ne homines mundani intelligerent, sed solum homines caelestes; quod homines mundani non intelligerent, erat ideo ne interiora 
Verbi profanarent, {16}nam sic in omnium atrocissimum infernum, quod est infernum profanatorum Verbi, se conjicerent; idcirco a Domino dictum est apud Lucam, Vobis datum est cognoscere mysteria 
regni Dei, reliquis vero in parabolis, ut videntes non videant, et audientes non audiant, viii 10: </p>
<p>et apud Johannem, Dixit Esaias, Excaecavit illorum oculos, et obturavit illorum cor, ut non videant 
oculis suis, et intelligant corde, et convertant se, et sanem illos, xii 40; </p>
<p>`ne sanem illos' dicitur quia qui sanantur et iterum redeunt ad falsa et mala, illi profanant; qui sunt illi intelliguntur 
apud Matthaeum xii 43-45. Sed dicetur nunc quid per Domini verba supra allata in sensu 6 interno intelligitur: agitur ibi in illo sensu de illis qui per falsa volunt destruere vera fidei, ita {17} 
vitam spiritualem apud hominem cum in tentationibus est, {18} in persecutionibus, (m)et apud spiritus bonos cum in infestationibus a spiritibus malis sunt;(n) per `maxillam' significatur affectio 
veri interioris, per `dextram maxillam' affectio veri ex bono, per `alapam infligere' significatur actus laedendi illam, per `tunicam' et `pallium' significatur verum in forma externa, n. 4677, 4741, 
4742, per `trahere in jus' significatur conatus destruendi, per `miliare' significatur id quod ducit ad verum, simile enim per miliare quod per viam; quod via sit quod ducit ad verum, videatur n. 627, 
2333, 3477; per `mutuum dare' significatur instruere; inde patet quid significatur per `dare omnibus qui petunt,' nempe confiteri omnia suae fidei in Dominum; quod itaque `non resistendum sit malo,' 
est quia malum nihil nocet illis qui in vero et bono sunt, tuti enim sunt a Domino. 7 Haec sunt quae sub illis Domini verbis recondita sunt; et quia illa sunt, solum dicit Dominus, `Audivistis quod dictum 
sit, Oculum pro oculo, et dentem pro dente,' non autem plura; quia per `oculum' significatur verum interius fidei, et per `dentem' verum exterius fidei, ut in sequentibus videbitur.  Ex his patet 
quomodo Dominus cum fuit in mundo, locutus {19}est, quod nempe sicut ubivis in Verbo Veteris Testamenti, simul pro angelis in {20} caelo et simul pro hominibus in mundo, nam loquela Ipsius fuit in se 
Divina (c)et caelestis, quia {21} ex Divino et per caelum; sed quae locutus, sistebantur per talia quae correspondebant in mundo; illa quae correspondent, docet sensus internus. 8 Quod `alapam infligere' 
seu `percutere maxillam' sit destruere {22}vera, patet a locis in Verbo ubi {23}'percutere maxillam' dicitur; et quia id in genuino sensu significat destructionem veri, ideo in opposito significat 
destructionem falsi, in quo sensu occurrit apud Davidem, Percuties omnes hostes meos maxillam, dentes impiorum confringes, Ps. iii 8 [A.V.7]: </p>
<p>apud Micham, Virga (x)percutient super maxillam judicem 
Israelis, iv 14[A.V.   v 1]: </p>
<p>et apud Esaiam, Frenum seducentis super maxillis populorum, xxx 28;  `facies' enim significat affectiones, n. 4796, 4797, 4799, 5102, 5695, 6604; inde {24}illa quae 
sunt faciei significant talia quae sunt affectionum et correspondent eorum functionibus {25}et usibus, {26}sicut oculus intellectum veri, nares perceptionem veri; illa quae oris sunt, sicut maxillae, 
labia, guttura, lingua, talia quae enuntiationis veri sunt, n. 4796-4805. @1 9048 IT$ @2 alter AIT$ @3 sibi AI$ @4 et$ @5 After influit$ @6 at$ @7 i ejus inde$ @8 hoc est malo in corde mali,
