<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8214节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8214.</strong>“使埃及人的营混乱了”表结果，由邪恶所生虚假的延伸又回到他们身上。这从“使埃及人的营混乱”的含义清楚可知，“使埃及人的营混乱”是指他们企图施加在那些处于真理和良善之人身上的邪恶所生的虚假回到他们身上。这些话之所以表示这些事，是因为主在恶人中间的同在就会引发这种效果。事实上，想通过注入虚假和邪恶而向善人施暴的恶人使自己受到报应性的惩罚，也就是说，他们企图施加在别人身上的虚假和邪恶转而回到他们自己身上。这种被称为报应性惩罚的惩罚来自存在于天堂中的以下秩序律法：<br />无论何事，你们愿意人怎样待你们，你们也要怎样待人，因为这就是律法和先知。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.12.htm">7:12</a>）<br />因此，那些出于良善或从心里行善事的人从别人那里接受善事；而另一方面，那些出于邪恶或从心里行坏事的人也从别人那里接受坏事。正因如此，一切良善都附有自己的赏赐，一切邪恶都附有自己的惩罚（<a href="696.htm">696</a>，<a href="967.htm">967</a>，<a href="1857.htm">1857</a>，<a href="6559.htm">6559</a>节）。由此明显可知，“使埃及人的营混乱了”表示由邪恶所生虚假的延伸又回到他们身上，并造成混乱。在恶人中间引发这一切的，是主的同在（参看<a href="7989.htm">7989</a>节）。</p>

And troubled the camp of the Egyptians. That this signifies that the consequent extensions of falsity from evil returned upon them, is evident from the signification of "troubling the camp of the Egyptians," 
as being the return upon them of the falsities from evil which they were endeavoring to inflict on those who were in truth and good. These things are signified by these words because the presence 
of the Lord with the evil leads to this effect; for the evil who by means of injections of falsity and evil desire to inflict violence on the good, cast themselves into the penalty of retaliation, 
which is, that the falsities and evils which they endeavor to inflict, fall back on themselves. This punishment, which is called the punishment of retaliation, comes from the following law of order 
in heaven: "All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: this is the law and the prophets" (Matt. 7:12); and therefore they who do what is good from good, or from the 
heart, receive what is good from others; and also on the other hand, they who do what is evil from evil, or from the heart, receive what is evil from others. Hence it is that every good has its reward 
attached to it, and every evil its punishment (n. 696, 967, 1857, 6559). From all this it is now evident that by "Jehovah troubled the camp of the Egyptians," is signified that the extensions of falsity 
from evil returned upon them, and caused the trouble. That this arises with the evil through the presence of the Lord, see n. 7989. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8214</b></p><p><b>8214.</b>
'And troubled the camp of the Egyptians' means that as a result all their reaching out with falsity arising from evil recoiled on them. This is clear from the meaning of 'troubling the camp of the Egyptians' 
as the recoiling on them of the falsities arising from evil which they attempted to inflict on those governed by truth and goodness. The reason why such things are meant by these words is that 
the Lord's presence among the evil produces that effect. For the evil who wish to do violence to the good by introducing falsity and evil on them expose themselves to retaliatory punishment, which involves 
the recoiling on themselves of the falsities and evils which they aim to inflict on others. This punishment, called retaliatory punishment, has its origin in the following law of order existing 
in heaven, </p>
<blockquote>
All things whatever you wish people to do to you, do also to them; this is the Law and the Prophets. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%207:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 7:12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore those who are moved by good, or from the heart, to do good 
receive good from others; and also conversely, those who are moved by evil, or from the heart, to do evil receive evil from others. So it is that all good has its reward attached to it, and all evil 
its punishment, <a href="696.htm">696</a>, <a href="967.htm">967</a>, <a href="1857.htm">1857</a>, <a href="6559.htm">6559</a>. From all this it is now evident that 'Jehovah troubled the camp of the Egyptians' means that all their reaching out with falsity arising from evil recoiled on them, 
and that this was the reason for their being troubled. The Lord's presence is what gives rise to this among the evil, see <a href="7989.htm">7989</a>. </p>

`Et perturbavit castra Aegyptiorum': quod significet quod inde extensiones falsi ex malo relaberentur super illos, constat ex significatione `perturbare castra Aegyptiorum' quod sit relapsus falsorum 
ex malo super illos, quae conabantur inferre illis qui in vero et bono; quod haec per illa verba significentur, est quia praesentia Domini apud malos illum effectum sistit; mali enim qui per injectiones 
falsi et mali violentiam inferre bonis volunt se conjiciunt in poenam talionis, quae est quod falsa et mala quae intendunt inferre relabantur in illos; poena haec, quae poena talionis vocatur, venit 
ex hac lege ordinis in caelo, Omnia quaecumque volueritis ut faciant vobis homines, sic et vos facite illis; haec est lex et prophetae, Matth. vii 12; </p>
<p>quapropter qui bonum faciunt ex bono seu ex 
corde bonum recipiunt ab aliis {1}, et quoque vicissim, qui malum faciunt ex malo seu ex corde, malum recipiunt ab aliis; inde est quod cuivis bono adjuncta sit remuneratio ejus, et cuivis malo punitio 
ejus, n. 696, 967, 1857, 6559; ex his nunc patet {2} quod per quod `Jehovah (x)perturbavit castra Aegyptiorum' significetur quod extensiones falsi ex malo relaberentur super illos, inde illis perturbatio; 
quod {3}hoc existat apud malos per praesentiam Domini, videatur n. 7989. 	@1 i; imo in illos influit felix sicut ab universo coelo$ 	@2 i unde est$ 	@3 tale$ </p>
