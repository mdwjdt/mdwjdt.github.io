<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2998.</strong>多年来，这种对应关系的存在对我来说再熟悉不过了。尽管事实上，人并不知道对应关系的存在，也不相信他与灵界有任何关联。然而，他的一切联系皆来自灵界，没有这种联系，无论他自己还是他的任何部位，都无法存活片刻。因为他的一切持续存在皆依赖于这种联系。我还得知哪些天使社群属于哪个人体的具体部位，以及它们具有何种性质。例如，哪些社群属于心脏区域及其性质，哪些社群属于肺脏区域及其性质，哪些社群属于肝脏区域及其性质，以及哪些社群属于诸如眼、耳、舌等感觉器官及其性质。对此，蒙主怜悯，我们将单独予以论述。</p>

That such correspondences exist has become so familiar to me in the course of years that hardly anything can be more so; though the fact itself is such that man does not know of its existence, nor believes 
that he has any connection with the spiritual world; when yet all his connection is from this correspondence; and without this connection neither himself nor any part of him could subsist a moment; 
for all his subsistence is from it. It has also been given me to know what angelic societies belong to each province of the body, and also of what quality they are; as for instance what societies 
and of what quality belong to the province of the heart; what and of what quality to the province of the lungs; what and of what quality to the province of the liver; and also what and of what quality 
belong to the different sensories, as to the eye, to the ears, to the tongue, and the rest; concerning which, of the Lord's Divine mercy we shall speak singly. </p>

The existence of such correspondences has for many years been made something so familiar to me that scarcely anything could be more so. This has happened to me even though man's condition is such that 
he does not know of the existence of that correspondence and does not believe that he has any connection with the spiritual world. Yet all his connection is from that world and without it neither he 
nor any part of him could continue to exist for a single moment. On that connection depends the whole continuance of his existence. I have also been given to know which angelic communities belong to 
which particular part of the body, and also to know what they are like. I have been given to know, for example, which communities belong to the region of the heart, and what these are like; which ones 
belong to the lungs, and what these are like; which communities belong to the liver, and what they are like; and which ones belong to the sensory organs, such as the eye, the ears, the tongue, and the 
rest, and what those communities are like. In the Lord's Divine mercy these will be dealt with as a separate subject. </p>

Quod tales correspondentiae sint, per plures annos ita mihi familiare factum est ut vix aliquid familiarius, tametsi tale sit ut homo non sciat quod sit, {1}nec credat quod aliquem nexum habeat cum 
mundo spirituali, cum tamen omnis nexus ejus est inde, et ne quidem subsistere potest momento, nec aliqua pars in illo, absque hoc nexu; inde {2}omnis ejus subsistentia.  Etiam scire mihi datum, quaenam 
societates angelicae ad unamquamvis provinciam corporis pertinent, tum quales sunt{3}, ut {4}quaenam et quales ad provinciam cordis; {4}quaenam et quales ad provinciam pulmonum, tum {4}quaenam et quales 
ad hepatis{5}; tum {4}quaenam et quales ad sensoria, ut ad oculum, ad aures, ad linguam, et ad reliqua; {6}de quibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, singillatim. @1 et I but A had et credat quod
