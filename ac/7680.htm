<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7680节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7680.</strong>“整整一昼一夜”表侵扰者的一切觉知，无论模糊的还是不模糊的，也就是说，有了毁灭。这从“昼”和“夜”的含义清楚可知：“昼”是指不模糊的觉知的状态；“夜”是指模糊觉知的状态。因为白天的时间段，即早晨、中午、晚上和夜间，对应于属聪明和智慧的启示状态（参看<a href="5672.htm">5672</a>，<a href="6110.htm">6110</a>节），因而对应于觉知的状态，总体上的昼夜也是如此。“昼夜”在此之所以被称为觉知的状态，而非启示的状态，是因为侵扰的恶人没有启示，尽管他们仍有觉知。只要他们仍留有从自己所生活的教会那里获得的真理和良善的任何知识，他们就拥有觉知。因为他们通过真理和良善与那些住在天堂里的人交流。不过，一旦他们被剥夺这些知识，如他们经历荒凉时的情形，他们就不再拥有任何觉知。诚然，地狱里的人能证明他们的邪恶是正当的，也能证明他们的虚假是正确的；但这不是觉知。觉知就是看到真理就是真理，良善就是良善；以及邪恶就是邪恶，虚假就是虚假。而视真理为虚假，视良善为邪恶并非觉知；反之，视邪恶为良善，视虚假为真理也并非觉知。凡如此行的人都没有觉知，只有幻想；这幻想产生一种觉知的表象，这些人由此知道如何通过诸如显明给感官并支持恶欲的那类观念来使得虚假和邪恶合理化。</p>

All that day, and all the night. That this signifies in everything of the perception both obscure and not obscure with the infesters, namely, there was destruction, is evident from the signification 
of "day," as being a state of perception not obscure; and from the signification of "night," as being a state of obscure perception; for the times of the day, morning, noon, evening, and night, correspond 
to the states of enlightenment that belong to intelligence and wisdom (see n. 5672, 6110), thus to perceptions; and so in general do day and night. It is here said "perceptions," not "states of enlightenment," 
because the evil who infest have no enlightenment, and yet have perception; but they have perception only so long as any knowledge of truth and good from the church in which they have lived 
remains with them, for by means of truth and good they communicate with those who are in heaven. But when they have been deprived of these knowledges, which is done when they have been devastated, 
they then no longer have any perception. The infernals can indeed confirm their evils, and also their falsities, but this is not perception. Perception is to see that truth is truth, and good good; 
and also that evil is evil, and falsity falsity; but it is not perception to see truth as falsity and good as evil; or the reverse, evil as good and falsity as truth. They who do this, instead of perception, 
have phantasy, which produces an appearance of perception, whereby such know how to confirm falsities and evils by such things as are obvious to the senses and are in favor of concupiscences. </p>

'The whole of that day and the whole of that night' means all the perception, both that which was darkened and that which was not darkened, of the molesting ones - that is to say, it was all destroyed. 
This is clear from the meaning of 'day' as a state of undarkened perception; and from the meaning of 'night' as a state of darkened perception. For periods of the day - morning, midday, evening, and 
night - correspond to degrees of enlightenment, that is, of intelligence and wisdom, <a href="5672.htm">5672</a>, <a href="6110.htm">6110</a>, and so to degrees of perception. In general day and night are called degrees of perception, not of enlightenment, 
because the evil who molest have no enlightenment, though they may still have perception. They have it for as long as there remains with them any knowledge at all of truth and goodness which 
they had acquired from the Church in which they had lived. For through truth and goodness they have contact with those who are in heaven. But once they have been deprived of such knowledge, as happens 
when they have undergone vastation, they no longer have any perception. Those in hell are, it is true, able to justify their evils, and also their falsities; but this is not perception. Perception 
is seeing that truth is truth and good is good, and also that evil is evil and falsity is falsity. But it is not perception when people see truth as falsity, or good as evil, and conversely see evil 
as good or falsity as truth. Those who do this have delusion instead of perception. That delusion takes on the appearance of perception, in that people such as they know how to justify falsities and 
evils by means of the kinds of ideas that suggest themselves to the senses and lend support to their evil longings. </p>

`Toto die illo et tota nocte illa': quod significet omne perceptionis, tam obscurae quam non obscurae, apud infestantes, nempe quod destructum, constat ex significatione `diei' quod sit status perceptionis 
non obscurae; et ex significatione `noctis' quod sit status perceptionis obscurae; nam tempora diei, ut mane, meridies, vespera, et nox, correspondent illustrationibus quae sunt intelligentiae 
et sapientiae, n. 5672, 6110, ita perceptionibus; in genere dies et nox perceptiones dicuntur, non illustrationes, quia malis qui infestant non est illustratio, sed usque est perceptio; sed tamdiu illis 
est perceptio, quamdiu apud illos aliquid cognitionis veri et boni {1}ab Ecclesia in qua vixerant remanet, nam per verum et bonum communicant cum illis qui in caelo; at cum deprivati sunt cognitionibus 
illis, {2}quod fit quando devastati sunt, {3}tunc non amplius illis est aliqua perceptio; possunt quidem infernales confirmare sua mala et quoque sua falsa; sed hoc non est perceptio; {4} perceptio 
est videre quod verum sit verum et bonum bonum, tum quod malum sit malum et falsum falsum, sed non perceptio est videre verum ut falsum, ac bonum ut malum, {5}}tum vicissim, malum ut bonum, et falsum 
ut verum; {6}illis qui hoc faciunt loco perceptionis est phantasia, quae facit apparentiam perceptionis, {7}per quod tales sciant confirmare falsa et mala per talia quae {8} sensibus obvia sunt et
