<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8148节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8148.</strong>“他带着六百辆特选的战车”表在自己秩序中的、支持属于分离之信的虚假的一切和每个教义事物。这从“六百”和“战车”的含义清楚可知：“六百”是指集为一体的信之真理和良善的每一个和一切方面，因而在反面意义上是指与仁分离之信的虚假和邪恶的每一个和一切方面（“六百”的这种含义从前面关于数字“六十万”说明可以看出来<a href="7973.htm">7973</a>节）；“战车”是指信之教义事物，在此是指分离之信的教义事物（参看<a href="8146.htm">8146</a>节）。“特选的战车”表示这信的主要教义事物，其余的皆从属于它们。从属或服务于它们的教义事物由接着六百辆特选的战车所提到的“埃及的战车”，就是接着提到的六百来表示。<br />要知道，此处“法老的军队、百姓”，以及他的“战车、马匹和马兵”所表示的这些虚假尤指那些陷入说服性信仰的人，也就是说服自己相信他们所在的教会教义事物是真的，然而却过着邪恶生活之人的虚假。和得救之信不同，这种说服性信仰是与生活的邪恶同在的；因为说服性信仰是一种说服，即人们说服自己相信属教会教义的一切都是真的，然而他们如此相信不是为了真理，或生活，甚至不是为了得救（他们几乎不信这一点），只是为了他们自己的利益，也就是为了获得重要地位、财富和由这些所带来的名声。他们学习教义事物是为了获得这些利益，因而不是为了他们能服务于教会和灵魂的拯救，而是为了服务于他们自己和属他们的人。因此，对他们来说，这些教义事物是真是假都一样，没什么区别。他们对此毫不关心，更不用说去费心探求发现了；因为他们没有为了真理而对真理的情感。无论它们是哪种教义事物，他们都赞同；当赞同它们时，他们就会说服自己说，它们是真的，却想不到虚假能和真理一样被认可或确认（<a href="4741.htm">4741</a>，<a href="5033.htm">5033</a>，<a href="6865.htm">6865</a>，<a href="7012.htm">7012</a>，<a href="7680.htm">7680</a>，<a href="7950.htm">7950</a>节）。<br />这就是说服性信仰的起源。这种信仰因不视邻舍和邻舍的良善，因而不视主为目标，只以自我和世界，也就是重要地位和物质利益为目的，故与生活的邪恶结合，而不是与生活的良善结合。因为信在与这良善结合时，就是得救之信。这种信是由主赐下的，而另一种信则来源于人自己。主所赐下的信存到永远，而另一种则在来世消散，甚至如果他们不能因这信获得什么，在世上就会消散。不过，只要人们能从中得利，他们就会为它而战，如同为天堂本身而战，尽管事实上，他们如此行不是为了那信，而是为了他们自己。因为属于信，也就是教义的事物对这些人来说，只是达到目的，也就是获得显赫和富足的手段。在世上，持守这种信的人与持守得救之信的人难以区分，因为他们也出于一种激情说话和讲道；这种激情似乎属于真正的热情，但它是由爱自己爱世界所激发的激情。<br />他们就是“法老和埃及人”尤其所表示的人，在来世，他们会经历这种信的荒凉。当这种信彻底荒凉时，他们就会沉浸于邪恶所生的纯粹虚假，因为那时虚假从恶人身上爆发出来。虚假之所以爆发出来，是因为每种邪恶都伴有自己的虚假；事实上，这二者结合在一起。当这些人置身于其生活的邪恶时，这些虚假就会显现。那时，这邪恶就像一团火，而虚假则像这团火发出的光。这种邪恶和它所产生的虚假，完全不同于其它邪恶和衍生的虚假。它比其它一切邪恶都更可憎，因为它违背信之良善和真理；因此，这种邪恶含有亵渎在里面。亵渎就是承认真理和良善，然而却又过着违背它们的生活（<a href="593.htm">593</a>，<a href="1008.htm">1008</a>，<a href="1010.htm">1010</a>，<a href="1059.htm">1059</a>，<a href="2051.htm">2051</a>，<a href="3398.htm">3398</a>，<a href="3898.htm">3898</a>，<a href="4289.htm">4289</a>，<a href="4601.htm">4601</a>，<a href="6959.htm">6959</a>，<a href="6963.htm">6963</a>，<a href="6971.htm">6971</a>节）。</p>

And he took six hundred chosen chariots. That this signifies all and each of the doctrinal things of falsity which are of faith separate, in their order, is evident from the signification of the number 
"six hundred," as being each and all things of the truth and good of faith in one complex, thus in the opposite sense each and all things of the falsity and evil of faith separate from charity (that 
these are signified by "six hundred" can be seen from what has been shown concerning the number "six hundred thousand," n. 7973); and from the signification of "chariots," as being doctrinal things 
of faith, here of faith separate (see just above, n. 8146). By "chosen chariots" are signified the chief doctrinal things of this faith, on which the rest depend; those which depend on them, or serve 
them, being signified by "the chariots of Egypt" (of which presently).  [2] Be it known that these falsities, which are here signified by "Pharaoh, his army, and his people," also by his "chariots, horses, 
and horsemen," are especially the falsities of those who are in persuasive faith, that is, who persuade themselves that the doctrinal things of the church in which they are, are true, and yet are 
in a life of evil. Persuasive faith exists together with evil of life, but not saving faith; for persuasive faith is a persuasion that all things that belong to the doctrine of the church are true, 
not for the sake of truth, nor for the sake of life, nor even for the sake of salvation, for in this they scarcely believe; but for the sake of self-advantage, that is, for the sake of getting honors 
and wealth, and for the sake of reputation with a view to these. They learn doctrinal things in order to acquire such things, thus not to the end that they may be of service to the church and the salvation 
of souls, but to serve themselves and those who belong to them; and therefore it is all the same to them whether these doctrinal things are true, or false; this they care nothing about, still less 
inquire into, for they are in no affection of truth for the sake of truth. No matter what kind of doctrinal things they may be, they confirm them; and when they have confirmed them, they persuade 
themselves that they are true, not considering that falsities can be confirmed equally as well as truths (n. 4741, 5033, 6865, 7012, 7680, 7950).  [3] This is the source of persuasive faith, which, because 
it has not for its end, and does not regard, the neighbor and his good, thus not the Lord, but self and the world, that is, honors and self-advantage, is conjoined with evil of life, but not with 
good of life; for assuredly the faith that is conjoined with this is saving faith. This faith is given by the Lord, but the other is from the man himself. The one remains to eternity; the other is 
dissipated in the other life, and is also dissipated in the world if nothing is gained by it. But so long as men profit by it, they fight for it as for heaven itself, although it is not for that faith, 
but for themselves; for the things of faith, that is, of doctrine, are to them as means to an end; that is, to eminence and opulence. They who are in this faith in the world can with difficulty be distinguished 
from those who are in saving faith, for they speak and preach from an ardor as of zeal for the doctrine; but it is an ardor from the fire of the love of self and of the world.  [4] These 
are they who are especially signified by "Pharaoh and the Egyptians," and in the other life they are vastated in respect to this faith; and this being vastated, they are in mere falsities from evil, 
for falsities then burst forth from the evil. Every evil is attended with its falsity, for they are joined together; and the falsities appear when they are left to the evil of their life. The evil is 
then like a fire, and the falsities are like the light from it. This kind of evil and the consequent falsity is quite different from other kinds of evils and the consequent falsities, being more detestable 
than all others, because it is contrary to the goods and truths of faith, and therefore there is profanation in this evil. (Profanation is the acknowledgment of truth and good and yet a life contrary 
thereto, n. 593, 1008, 1010, 1059, 2051, 3398, 3898, 4289, 4601, 6959, 6963, 6971.) </p>

'And he took six hundred chosen chariots' means each and every doctrinal teaching that upholds falsity belonging to separated faith, in their own order. This is clear from the meaning of the number 'six 
hundred' as each and every aspect of the truth and good of faith taken all together, and so in the contrary sense as each and every aspect of the falsity and evil of faith separated from charity (this 
meaning of 'six hundred' may become clear from what has been shown regarding the number 'six hundred thousand' in <a href="7973.htm">7973</a>); and from the meaning of 'chariots' as doctrinal teachings upholding faith, 
in this instance separated faith, dealt with just above in <a href="8146.htm">8146</a>. 'Chosen chariots' means the chief doctrinal teachings that uphold that faith, to which all other teachings are subordinate. Those that 
are subordinate to them or serve them are meant by 'the chariots of Egypt', referred to immediately after the six hundred chosen ones. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It should be recognized that these falsities - the ones that 
are meant here by Pharaoh, his army and people, and also his chariots, horses, and horsemen - are chiefly falsities present with people whose faith is no more than persuasion, that is, people who 
persuade themselves that the teachings of the Church they are in are true and who nevertheless lead a life of evil. This kind of faith, unlike saving faith, goes together with evil in life, because it 
is a faith in which people persuade themselves that everything the Church teaches is true, yet do so not for the sake of truth, or for the sake of life, or even for the sake of salvation (since they 
have scarcely any belief in this), only for their own advantage, that is, to acquire important positions and wealth, and reputation because of these. It is to gain such advantages that they imbibe religious 
teachings. Thus they do not learn them to the end that they may be of service to the Church and the salvation of souls, but to themselves and their dependents. Therefore it makes no difference 
to them whether those teachings are true or false. They do not care which they are, much less do they bother to find out; for they have no affection for truth because it is the truth. They endorse those 
teachings regardless of the character of them; and when they have endorsed them they tell themselves that they are true, without stopping to think that falsities can be endorsed just as much as truths, <a href="4741.htm">4741</a>, <a href="5033.htm">5033</a>, <a href="6865.htm">6865</a>, <a href="7012.htm">7012</a>, <a href="7680.htm">7680</a>, <a href="7950.htm">7950</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 This is how faith that is no more than persuasion arises. And since it does not see the neighbour and the good of the neighbour, or therefore the Lord, 
as the end in view, only self and the world, that is, important positions and material gain, that kind of faith is linked to evil in life, and not to good in life. For faith, when linked to this good, 
is saving faith. This kind of faith is imparted by the Lord, but the other has its origin in people themselves. Faith imparted by the Lord remains forever, the other kind melts away in the next life. 
It even melts away in the world if they can gain nothing by it. As long as they can gain anything they fight for it as if for heaven itself, though in fact they do so not for that faith but for themselves. 
For the things that belong to faith, which are religious teachings, are for those people simply the means to an end, which is high position and wealth. People in the world with this type of faith 
are scarcely distinguishable from those possessing saving faith, since they speak and proclaim in favour of religious teachings with an ardour that seemingly belongs to true zeal, but is an ardour 
fired by selfish and worldly love. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 These are the people who are meant in particular by 'Pharaoh' and 'the Egyptians', who in the next life undergo vastation of that kind of faith. When that vastation 
is completed they are steeped in utter falsities arising from evil, for falsities now burst out of evil. Falsities do so because all evil has falsity present with it, since the two have been joined 
together. Those falsities make their appearance when such people are left exposed to the evil in their life. That evil is then like fire, and the falsities are like the light coming from a fire. 
This kind of evil, and the falsity arising from it, is altogether different from other kinds of evil and derivative falsities. It is more loathsome than all the rest, because it is contrary to the forms 
of good and the truths of faith, and that kind of evil consequently holds profanation within it. Profanation consists in acknowledging truth and good and yet living contrary to them, <a href="593.htm">593</a>, <a href="1008.htm">1008</a>, <a href="1010.htm">1010</a>,

Ecclesiae {4}in qua sunt vera sint, et tamen in vita mali sunt; fides persuasiva datur cum malo vitae, non autem fides salvifica, nam fides persuasiva est persuasio quod vera sint omnia quae
