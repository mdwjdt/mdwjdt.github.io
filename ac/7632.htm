<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7632节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7632.</strong>“我使他的心发沉，使他臣仆的心发沉”表他们仍旧固执，并且彼此都是一样的。这从“发沉”、“刚硬”、“使心坚硬”的含义，以及法老的代表清楚可知：“发沉”、“刚硬”、“使心坚硬”是指固执（参看<a href="7272.htm">7272</a>，<a href="7300.htm">7300</a>，<a href="7305.htm">7305</a>节）；心发沉的法老是指那些进行侵扰的人，当经上说“他和他臣仆”时，所表示的是彼此都是一样的，因为臣仆和他一起构成他的家。当经上说“耶和华使法老的心发沉”时，内义上的意思是说，法老使自己的心发沉。古时，为了简单人的缘故，所有坏事都被归与耶和华；这是因为简单人不可能知道，并且大多数也不明白所生的事，其源头除在耶和华里面外，还能在哪里。他们也不知道如何理解这一真理：耶和华容许魔鬼团伙造成邪恶，并不阻止他们，尽管祂拥有一切能力。由于简单人不明白这些事，甚至连聪明人也几乎不明白，所以才照着多数人所认为的说，甚至邪恶也源于耶和华。这是圣言的一个共同特征，圣言的字义适合简单人的信仰。在圣言中被归与耶和华的邪恶来源于人（参看<a href="2447.htm">2447</a>，<a href="6071.htm">6071</a>，<a href="6991.htm">6991</a>，<a href="6997.htm">6997</a>，<a href="7533.htm">7533</a>节）。</p>

For I have made heavy his heart, and the heart of his servants. That this signifies that they all in general were determined, is evident from the signification of "making heavy," "making hard," and "making 
firm, the heart," as being to be determined (see n. 7272, 7300, 7305); and from the representation of Pharaoh, whose heart was made heavy, as being those who infest; and when it is said "he and 
his servants," all in general are signified, for the servants together with him constitute the household. Its being said that Jehovah "made heavy the heart of Pharaoh," in the internal sense signifies 
that Pharaoh made heavy his own heart. In ancient times, for the sake of the simple, all evil was attributed to Jehovah; and this because the simple could not know, and most of them could not comprehend, 
how that which came to pass could come from any other source than Jehovah; nor how it is to be understood that Jehovah permits the diabolical crew to occasion evil, and why He does not prevent it, 
when yet He has all power. As the simple could not apprehend this, nor scarcely even the intelligent, it was therefore said, as believed by many, that even evil had sprung from Jehovah. This is a common 
thing in the Word, the sense of the letter of which is in accordance with the faith of the simple. (That the evil which in the Word is attributed to Jehovah, is from man, see n. 2447, 6071, 6991, 
6997, 7533.) </p>

'For I have made his heart stubborn, and the heart of his servants' means that they remained obstinate, all in common with one another. This is clear from the meaning of 'making the heart stubborn', 
'hardening it', and 'making it unyielding' as remaining obstinate, dealt with in <a href="7271.htm">7271</a>, <a href="7300.htm">7300</a>, <a href="7305.htm">7305</a>; and from the representation of Pharaoh, whose 'heart was made stubborn', as those engaged in molestation 
- all in common with one another being meant when it says 'he and his servants', because the servants and he together make up his house. When it says that Jehovah made Pharaoh's heart stubborn the 
meaning in the internal sense is that he himself made his heart stubborn. In ancient times everything bad was for simple people's benefit attributed to Jehovah. It was attributed to Him because simple 
people could not have known, and most of them could not have understood either, how the origin of things that happened could lie anywhere else than in Jehovah. Nor could they have known how to understand 
the truth that Jehovah permits the devil's crew to inflict evil and does not stop them, when yet He is all-powerful. Since simple people could not have grasped these matters, and also the intelligent 
could have scarcely done so, it was said, in keeping with what very many believed, that Jehovah was the author even of what was bad or evil. This is a common feature of the Word, whose literal sense 
is accommodated to the beliefs of simple people. The evil that is attributed in the Word to Jehovah has its origin in man, see <a href="2447.htm">2447</a>, <a href="6071.htm">6071</a>, <a href="6991.htm">6991</a>, <a href="6997.htm">6997</a>, <a href="7533.htm">7533</a>. </p>

`Quia Ego aggravavi cor illius et cor servorum illius': quod significet quod obstinaverint se communiter omnes, constat ex significatione `aggravare, indurare, et obfirmare cor' quod sit obstinare se, 
de qua n. 7272, 7300, 7305; ex repraesentatione `Pharaonis,' cujus cor {1}aggravabatur, quod sint qui infestant; et cum dicitur `ille et servi illius' significantur communiter omnes: {2}nam servi cum 
illo domum constituunt.  Quod dicatur quod `{3}Jehovah aggravaverit cor Pharaonis,' in sensu interno significat quod ille aggravaverit cor suum; antiquis temporibus propter simplices tribuebatur Jehovae 
omne {4} malum; et hoc fuit ob causam quia simplices non potuerunt scire, et {5}plerique nec comprehendere, quomodo quae eveniebant, aliunde possent {6}evenire quam a Jehovah; tum quomodo intelligendum 
quod Jehovah permittat ut turba diabolica inferat malum, et non inhibeat, cum tamen Ipsi (x)omnis potestas; quia simplices illa non potuerunt capere, et quoque vix intelligentes, idcirco dictum 
est {7}ut pluribus creditum quod a Jehovah etiam malum existeret; hoc commune est in Verbo, cujus sensus litterae est secundum fidem simplicium.  Quod malum quod Jehovae tribuitur in Verbo sit ab homine, 
videatur n. 2447, (x)6071, 6991, 6997, 7533. 	@1 aggravatum$ 	@2 per Pharaonem enim repraesentantur qui infestant in communi, inde per Pharaonem et servos illius significantur omnes in communi,
