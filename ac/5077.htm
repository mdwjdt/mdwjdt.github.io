<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5077节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5077.</strong>“埃及王的酒政”表在受心智的理解力部分支配的身体事物当中。这从“酒政”和“埃及王”的含义清楚可知：“酒政”是指受内在人的理解力部分支配的外在感觉或身体感觉，如下文所述；“埃及王”是指属世人，如下文所述（<a href="5079.htm">5079</a>节）。由于接下来的几节论述的主题是酒政和膳长，而他们表示属于身体的外在感官事物，故有必要说一说这些感官事物。众所周知，外在或身体感觉有五种，即：视觉、听觉、嗅觉、味觉和触觉；这些感觉构成身体的整个生命。因为没有这些感觉，身体根本没有生命可言；因此，当丧失它们时，身体就会死亡，变成一具尸体。所以，人的实际身体部分无非是感官印象，和随之由此产生的生命接受者。感官所扮演的角色是主体性的，而身体所扮演的角色是辅助性的。辅助性的东西若离开它适合服务的主体，甚至不能被称为人活在世上时所携带的身体；但辅助性的东西与它的主体在行如一体时就能被如此称呼。因此，这二者一起构成身体。<br />人的一切外在感觉都与他的内在感觉直接相关，因为它们被赋予人并被置于他的身体中，以便他活在世上时服务于他的内在人，并受这内在人的感官能力或感官事物支配。因此，当人的外在感觉开始主导他的内在感觉时，他就完了。当这种情况发生时，他的内在感官能力就仅仅被视为仆人，这仆人的功能就是强化或确认凡外在感官事物带着权威所迫切需要的东西。当外在感官事物处于这种状态时，它们便陷入刚才所说的颠倒次序（<a href="5076.htm">5076</a>节）。<br />如前所述，人的外在感觉与他的内在感觉直接相关，一般与理解力并意愿相关。所以，有些外在感官事物受人类心智的理解力部分支配，有些受意愿部分支配。有一种感官能力尤其受理解力支配，那就是视觉；还有一种感官能力受理解力支配，之后受意愿支配，那就是听觉；嗅觉，尤其味觉同时受这二者支配；而受意愿支配的能力则是触觉。大量证据表明，外在感官事物受理解力和意愿支配；还表明它们如何受支配；不过，要解释到这种程度需占用大量篇幅。然而，所涉及的某些事实可从前面各章节末尾有关这些感官的对应关系的说明得知。<br />另外，要知道，被称为信之真理的一切真理皆属于理解力部分，属于爱与仁的一切良善则与意愿部分一起存在。因此，理解力的功能是相信、承认、知道并看见真理，以及良善。而意愿的功能是感受到对真理的一种情感，并热爱它；凡人从中感受到一种情感并热爱之物就是良善。不过，至于当真理进入良善时，理解力如何影响意愿，以及当它将那良善付诸实践时，意愿如何影响理解力，这些都是需要更深入探究的问题。关于这些问题，蒙主的神性怜悯，我们将在不同的地方进一步予以讨论。<br />“酒政”之所以表示受内在人的理解力部分支配的感官，是因为用来喝的一切，或诸如此类的消费物，如酒、奶、水等，都与真理有关；真理喂养理解力，因而属于理解力。由于外在或身体感官起服务作用，故“酒政”表示那些感官或它们所感知到的东西。因为总的来说，“喝”与喂养理解力的真理有关（<a href="3069.htm">3069</a>，<a href="3071.htm">3071</a>，<a href="3168.htm">3168</a>，<a href="3772.htm">3772</a>，<a href="4017.htm">4017</a>，<a href="4018.htm">4018</a>节）；“酒”的具体含义是源于良善的真理，或源于仁的信（<a href="1071.htm">1071</a>，<a href="1798.htm">1798</a>节）；而“水”表示真理（<a href="680.htm">680</a>，<a href="2702.htm">2702</a>，<a href="3058.htm">3058</a>，<a href="3424.htm">3424</a>，<a href="4976.htm">4976</a>节）。由此可见“酒政”表示什么。</p>

The butler of the king of Egypt. That this signifies in those things in the body which are subject to the intellectual part, is evident from the signification of a "butler," as being that external sensuous, 
or sensuous of the body, which is subordinate or subject to the intellectual part of the internal man (of which hereafter); and from the signification of the "king of Egypt," as being the natural 
man (of which below, n. 5079). As the butler and the baker are treated of in the following verses, and as they signify the external sensuous things which are of the body, something must first be said 
about these sensuous things. It is known that the external or bodily senses are five, namely, sight, hearing, smelling, taste, and touch, and that these constitute all the life of the body; for without 
these senses the body does not live at all, and therefore when deprived of them it dies and becomes a corpse; so that the very bodily part of man is nothing else than a receptacle of sensations, 
and consequently of the life from them. The sensitive is the principal, and the bodily is the instrumental. The instrumental without its principal to which it is adapted cannot even be called that bodily 
with which man is invested during his life in the world; but only the instrumental together with the principal, when they act as one. This therefore is the bodily part. [2] All the external sensuous 
things of man bear relation to his internal sensuous things, for they are given to man and placed in his body in order that they may serve the internal man while it is in the world, and be subject 
to its sensuous things; and therefore when a man's external sensuous things begin to rule over his internal sensuous things, the man is lost; for then the internal sensuous things are considered to 
be mere servants, to serve for confirming those things which the external sensuous things command with authority. When the external sensuous things are in this state, they are in the inverted order spoken 
of just above (n. 5076).  [3] As before said, the external sensuous things of man bear relation to his internal sensuous things; in general, to his intellectual part and to his will part; there 
are therefore external sensuous things which are subject or subordinate to his intellectual part, and there are those which are subject to his will part. That sensuous which is especially subject to the 
intellectual part is the sight; that which is subject to the intellectual part and secondarily to the will part is the hearing; that which is subject to both together is the sense of smell, and still 
more the taste; but that which is subject to the will part is the touch. That the external sensuous things are subject to these parts, and in what manner, might be abundantly shown; but to enter upon 
the investigation of this now would lead us too far afield; yet the facts may in some measure be known from what has been shown concerning the correspondence of these senses, at the end of the preceding 
chapters. [4] And be it known further that all the truths which are said to be of faith pertain to the intellectual part; and that all the goods which are of love and charity are of the will part. 
Consequently it belongs to the intellectual part to believe, to acknowledge, to know, and to see truth and also good, but to the will part to be affected with and to love these; and that which man 
is affected with and loves, is good. But how the intellect flows into the will, when truth passes into good; and how the will flows into the intellect, when it acts upon it, are matters of still deeper 
investigation, concerning which, of the Lord's Divine mercy more will be said below as occasion offers.  [5] The reason why a "butler" signifies that sensuous which is subject or subordinate to the 
intellectual part of the internal man, is that everything which serves for drinking, or which is drunk-as wine, milk, water-bears relation to truth, which is of the intellectual part, thus bears relation 
to the intellectual part; and because it is an external sensuous, or sensuous of the body, that subserves, therefore by a "butler" is signified this sensuous, or this part of the sensuous things. 
(That "to give to drink" and "to drink" are in general predicated of the truths which are of the intellectual part, may be seen above, n. 3069, 3071, 3168, 3772, 4017, 4018; and that specifically they 
are predicated of the truth which is from good, or of the faith which is from charity, n. 1071, 1798; and that "water" is truth, n. 680, 2702, 3058, 3424, 4976.) From all this it may now be seen what 
is signified by a "butler." </p>

'The cupbearer of the king of Egypt' means among the things of the body which are subject to the understanding Part of the mind. This is clear from the meaning of 'the cupbearer' as the external or bodily 
senses that are subordinate or subject to the understanding part of the internal man, dealt with in what follows below; and from the meaning of 'the king of Egypt' as the natural man, dealt with 
below in <a href="5079.htm">5079</a>. Since the cupbearer and the baker are the subject of the narrative that follows and these mean the external senses belonging to the body, something must first be said about these. It is 
well known that the external or bodily senses are five in number - sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch - and also that these constitute the entire life of the body. For without those senses the 
body has no life at all, for which reason also when deprived of them it dies and becomes a corpse. The actual bodily part of the human being therefore is nothing else than a receiver of sensory impressions 
and consequently of the life resulting from these. The part played by the senses is the principal one and that by the body the instrumental. The instrumental without its principal which it is fitted 
to serve cannot even be called the body that a person carries around while living in the world; but the instrumental together with its principal, when they act as one, can be called such. The two 
together therefore constitute the body. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 A person's external senses are directly related to his internal ones, for they have been given to a person and placed within his body to serve his internal 
man while he is in the world and to exist subject to the sensory powers of that internal man. Consequently when a person's external senses begin to rule his internal ones he is done for. When this 
happens his internal sensory powers are regarded as no more than servants whose function is to reinforce whatever the external senses imperiously demand. When this is the state in which the external 
senses operate, order in their case has become turned around, a situation dealt with immediately above in <a href="5076.htm">5076</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 A person's external senses are, as stated, directly related to his internal ones, 
in general to the understanding and to the will. Consequently some external senses are subject or subordinate to the understanding part of the human mind, others are subject to the will part. One sensory 
power specifically subject to the understanding is sight; another subject to the understanding, and after that to the will also, is hearing. Smell, and more especially taste, are subject to both 
simultaneously, while the power subject to the will is touch. Much evidence could be introduced to show that the external senses are subject to the understanding and the will, and also to show how they 
are subject; but it would take up too much space to carry the explanation so far. Something of what is involved may be recognized from what has been shown at the ends of preceding chapters about the 
correspondence of those senses.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In addition it should be recognized that all truths that are called the truths of faith belong to the understanding part, and that all forms of good which are 
those of love and charity go with the will part. Consequently it is the function of the understanding to believe, acknowledge, know, and see truth - and good also. But the function of the will is to 
feel an affection for that truth and to love it; and whatever a person feels an affection for and loves is good. But how the understanding influences the will when truth passes into good, and how the 
will influences the understanding when it puts that good into effect, are matters for still deeper examination- In :he Lord's Divine mercy those matters will be discussed at various points further on. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
The reason 'the cupbearer' means the senses subject or subordinate to the understanding Part of the internal man is that everything which serves as drink, or which is consumed as such, for example, 
wine, milk, or water, is related to truth, which feeds the understanding and so belongs to the understanding Also, because the external or bodily senses play a ministering role, 'a cupbearer' therefore 
means those senses or what is perceived by them. For in general 'drinking' has reference to truths which feed the understanding, see <a href="3069.htm">3069</a>, <a href="3071.htm">3071</a>, <a href="3168.htm">3168</a>, <a href="3772.htm">3772</a>, <a href="4017.htm">4017</a>, <a href="4018.htm">4018</a>; the specific meaning of 
'wine' is truth deriving from good, or faith from charity, <a href="1071.htm">1071</a>, <a href="1798.htm">1798</a>, while 'water' means truth, <a href="680.htm">680</a>, <a href="2702.htm">2702</a>, <a href="3058.htm">3058</a>, <a href="3424.htm">3424</a>, <a href="4976.htm">4976</a>. From all this one may now see what 'the cupbearer' means. </p>

`Pincerna regis Aegypti': quod significet apud illa in corpore quae subjecta sunt parti intellectuali, constat ex significatione `pincernae' quod sit sensuale externum seu sensuale corporis quod 
subordinatum seu subjectum est parti intellectuali interni hominis, de qua sequitur; et ex significatione `regis Aegypti' quod sit naturalis homo, de {1}qua infra n. 5079. Quia in sequentibus agitur 
de `pincerna et pistore', et per illos significantur sensualia externa quae corporis, primum aliquid de sensualibus his dicendum est quod sensus externi seu corporis sint quinque, nempe visus, auditus, 
olfactus, gestus et tactus, notum est, et quoque quod hi constituant omne vitale corporis; corpus enim absque {2}illis sensibus prorsus non vivit, quapropter etiam quando privatur illis, moritur 
et fit cadaver; ipsum itaque corporeum hominis non aliud est quam receptaculum sensationum, consequenter vitae ex illis; principale est sensitivum, et instrumentale est corporeum, instrumentale 
absque suo principali cui adaptatum est, ne quidem dici potest corporeum quale circumfert homo cum vivit in mundo, sed instrumentale simul cum principali, 2 quando haec unum agunt hoc itaque est 
corporeum. Sensualia externa hominis omnia se referunt ad sensualia interna ejus, data enim sunt homini et posita in corpore, ut interno homini inserviant dum est in mundo, et {3}ejus sensualibus subjecta 
sint; quapropter cum sensualia hominis externa incipiunt dominari super sensualia hominis interna, actum est cum homine; tunc enim sensualia interna non aliter considerantur quam famulitia 
quae inserviant confirmandis illis quae sensualia externa ex imperio jubent; cum in hoc statu sunt sensualia externa, tunc in inverso ordine sunt, de quo mox supra n. 5076. 3 Sensualia externa hominis 
se referunt, ut dictum, ad interna, in genere ad intellectuale et ad voluntarium; </p>
<p>quapropter sensualia externa sunt quae subjecta seu subordinata sunt parti hominis intellectuali et quae subjecta 
sunt parti ejus voluntariae; sensuale quod subjectum est parti intellectuali est imprimis visus, quod parti intellectuali et dein voluntariae est auditus, quod utrique simul est odoratus, et adhuc 
magis gustus, quod autem parti voluntariae est tactus; quod sensualia externa illis partibus subjecta sint, multis ostendi potest, et quoque quomodo subjecta sunt; sed nimis prolixum est illuc explicationem hic 
extendere; aliquatenus {4}sciri potest ab illis quae de correspondentia illorum sensuum ad finem capitum praecedentium ostensa sunt. 4     Porro sciendum {5} quod omnia vera quae fidei dicuntur, 
pertineant ad partem intellectualem, et quod bona quae amoris et charitatis sunt, sint partis voluntariae; consequenter partis intellectualis est credere, agnoscere, scire et videre 
verum et quoque bonum, sed partis voluntariae est affici illo et amare illud, et quo homo afficitur et quod amat, est bonum; sed quomodo intellectuale influit in voluntarium cum verum transit in bonum, 
et quomodo voluntarium influit in intellectuale cum agit illud, est adhuc altioris indaginis, de quibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus passim dicetur. Quod `pincerna' sit sensuale 
quod subjectum seu subordinatum 5 est parti intellectuali interni hominis, est quia omne quod potui inservit, seu quod propinatur, sicut `vinum, lac, aqua', se refert ad verum, quod est partis intellectualis, 
ita ad partem intellectualem, et quia sensuale externum seu corporis est quod subministrat, idcirco per `pincernam' id sensuale seu id sensualium significatur; quod `potare et bibere' 
in genere praedicetur de veris quae partis intellectualis, videatur n. 3069, 3071, 3168, 3772, 4017, 4018; </p>
<p>quod in specie '{6}vinum' sit verum quod ex bono, seu fides quae ex charitate, n. 1071, 
1798; et quod `aqua' sit verum, n. 680, 2702, 3058, 3424, 4976; ex his nunc constare potest quid `pincerna.' @1 quo$ @2 his$ @3 hujus$ @4 scire I$ @5 i est$ @6 enim I$ </p>
