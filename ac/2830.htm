<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2830节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2830.</strong>“看见一只公绵羊”表人类中的属灵成员。这从下文所解释的“公绵羊”的含义清楚可知。在教会，众所周知，在犹太人和以色列人的代表性教会中，燔祭和祭物表主的神性人。不过，以羊羔为燔祭和祭物表示一回事，以母绵羊和母山羊为祭表示另一回事，以小山羊、公绵羊和公山羊，以及公牛、公牛犊、牛犊和斑鸠、雏鸽为祭则又表示另一回事，素祭和奠祭也是如此。一般来说，这些献为祭品的事物表示主的神性属天、神性属灵和神性属世之物，并由此表示从主而来、存在于系主国度的每个人里面的属天、属灵和属世之物。这从取代燔祭和祭物的圣餐可以看出来。其中，面包和酒表示主的神性人：面包表祂的神性属天之物，酒表祂的神性属灵之物；因此它们表主对全人类的爱，以及反过来全人类对主的爱（<a href="2343.htm">2343</a>，<a href="2359.htm">2359</a>节）。由此明显可知，燔祭和祭物包含源于对主之爱的属天敬拜，和源于对邻之仁、因而源于对主之信的属灵敬拜（<a href="922.htm">922</a>，<a href="923.htm">923</a>，<a href="1823.htm">1823</a>，<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>节）。至于何为属天之物，何为属灵之物，也就是说，在主的国度或教会中，哪些人组成属天成员，哪些人组成属灵成员，这在前面已多次阐明（参看<a href="1155.htm">1155</a>，<a href="1577.htm">1577</a>，<a href="1824.htm">1824</a>，<a href="2048.htm">2048</a>，<a href="2088.htm">2088</a>，<a href="2184.htm">2184</a>，<a href="2227.htm">2227</a>，<a href="2669.htm">2669</a>，<a href="2708.htm">2708</a>，<a href="2715.htm">2715</a>节）。<br />因此，“公绵羊”表主的神性属灵之物，因而表人里面的属灵之物，或也可说，人类中的属灵成员。这从以公绵羊为燔祭和祭物可以看出来。例如，当亚伦和他的儿子成圣，供祭司职份，也就是举行就职仪式时，他们要取一只公牛犊献为赎罪祭，把它的血抹在坛的四角上，剩下的倒在坛脚；还要再宰杀一只公绵羊，把它的血洒在坛的周围，然后将这只公绵羊，即全羊献为燔祭；要另外宰杀一只公绵羊，把它的血抹在亚伦的耳垂、大拇指和大脚趾上；然后用它作摇祭，烧在燔祭上（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.1.htm">29:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.35.htm">35</a>；利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利8.1.htm">8:1</a>至末尾；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利9.2.htm">9:2</a>至末尾）。显然，所有这些仪式都是神圣的，之所以神圣，是因为它们代表和表示神圣事物。若不是这个原因，宰杀公牛犊，把它的血洒在坛角上，剩下的倒在坛脚；宰杀一只公绵羊、把它的血抹在亚伦的耳垂、大拇指和大脚趾上，把它献为摇祭，并烧在燔祭上等等，所有这些仪式都没有任何神圣性可言，因而不会产生任何敬拜，除非它们代表神圣事物。至于每个细节代表什么，若不通过内义，没有人清楚明白。献为赎罪祭的公牛犊表主的神性属世之物，公绵羊表祂的神性属灵之物，同时表人类中的属灵成员。就任祭司职份的仪式通过属灵之物来进行，因为人通过属灵之物被引入属天之物，或也可说，通过信之真理被引入爱之良善。同样，当亚伦进入圣所时，他也要献一只公牛犊为赎罪祭，献一只公绵羊为燔祭（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.2.htm">16:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.3.htm">3</a>）。<br />当拿细耳人满了离俗的日子时，他要献一只没有残疾、一岁的公羊羔作燔祭，一只没有残疾、一岁的母羊羔作赎罪祭，和一只没有残疾的公绵羊作平安祭（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民6.13.htm">6:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民6.17.htm">17</a>）。这是因为拿细耳人代表作为主之样式的属天之人（<a href="51.htm">51</a>，<a href="52.htm">52</a>，<a href="1013.htm">1013</a>节）。属天之人是这样：他具有属天之爱，也就是对主之爱，并由此具有属天的真理（<a href="202.htm">202</a>，<a href="337.htm">337</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>，<a href="2715.htm">2715</a>，<a href="2718.htm">2718</a>节）。这就是为何拿细耳人要献表示属天之物的公羊羔和母羊羔为祭，还献表示属灵之物的公绵羊为祭。节日期间，要献公牛犊、公绵羊和羊羔为祭。如，在除酵节的第一天，要献两只公牛犊、一只公绵羊、七只羊羔及其素祭为燔祭（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.18.htm">28:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.20.htm">20</a>）。在初熟的日子，也要献两只公牛犊、一只公绵羊、七只羊羔及其素祭为燔祭（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.26.htm">28:26</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.28.htm">28</a>）。在月朔，要献两只公牛犊、一只公绵羊、七只羊羔及其素祭为燔祭（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.11.htm">28:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.12.htm">12</a>）。七月初一日，要献一只公牛犊、一只公绵羊、七只公羊羔及其素祭为燔祭；七月十五日，要献十三只公牛犊、两只公绵羊，十四只公羊羔为燔祭，等等（参看民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.1.htm">29:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.12.htm">12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.17.htm">17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.20.htm">20</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.22.htm">22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.24.htm">24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.26.htm">26</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.36.htm">36</a>）。“公牛犊”和“公绵羊”表属灵之物，而“羊羔”表属天之物。因为他们在节日要通过属灵之物被圣化，并被引入这种状态。<br />由于“公绵羊”表主的神性人的神性属灵之物，也表人里面的属灵之物，故在以西结书，经上论到新殿和新耶路撒冷所在的地方，也就是主的属灵国度时，说：洁净了坛，就要献一只公牛犊为赎罪祭，献一只公绵羊为燔祭；并且七日内，每日要预备一只公山羊为赎罪祭，也要预备一只公牛犊和公绵羊为燔祭（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结43.23.htm">43:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结43.25.htm">25</a>）。而且，“当那日”，王要为众民预备公牛犊为燔祭，在这节的七日，每日预备七只公牛犊、七只公绵羊及素祭为燔祭（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结45.22.htm">45:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结45.24.htm">24</a>）；在安息日，他要预备六只羊羔和一只公绵羊（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结46.4.htm">46:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结46.6.htm">6</a>）。<br />普遍来说，新殿和新耶路撒冷表主的国度（参看<a href="402.htm">402</a>，<a href="940.htm">940</a>）；具体来说，表一个新教会（<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>节）。众所周知，那里既没有燔祭，也没有祭物。由此明显可知，燔祭和祭物表爱的属天之物和信的属灵之物。因为这些事物属于主的国度，因此这类事物就是此处“公牛犊”、“公绵羊”和“公羊羔”所表示的。“公牛犊”和“公绵羊”表属灵之物，这从以西结书这一部分内义上的每个细节明显可知，一般从以下事实可以看出来：即“新殿”和“新耶路撒冷”表主的属灵国度，而“锡安”表属天国度。<br />“公绵羊”表属灵之物，或也可说，表那些属灵之人。这也明显可见于但以理书。但以理看见一只双角的公绵羊站在河边，然后又看见一只公山羊抵触公绵羊，折断它的两角，践踏它（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.3.htm">8:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.4.htm">4</a>等）。此处，“公绵羊”无非表属灵教会，“公山羊”表那些被脱离仁的信，即脱离良善的真理所主宰的人，他们一步步起来反对良善，最后反对主，正如所描述的。撒母耳记：<br />撒母耳对扫罗说，耶和华喜悦燔祭和祭物，岂如喜悦听从耶和华的声音呢？看哪，听命胜于献祭，顺从胜于公羊的脂油。（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上15.22.htm">15:22</a>）<br />此处论述的是顺从，故论述的是属灵的真理；这些话是对王说的，而王也表真理（<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>节）。所以，经上没有说“胜于公牛（或羔羊）的脂油”，而是说“胜于公羊的脂油”。<br />诗篇：<br />以色列出了埃及，雅各家离开说异言之民，那时，犹大为主的圣所，以色列为祂所治理的国度。沧海看见它就奔逃，约旦河也倒流；大山踊跃如公羊，小山跳舞如羊羔。沧海啊，什么使你奔逃？约旦哪，你为何倒流？大山哪，你为何踊跃如公羊？小山哪，你为何跳舞如羊羔？大地啊，在主的面前，在雅各神的面前，震动吧！祂叫磐石变为水池，叫坚石变为水泉。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗114.1.htm">114:1</a>至末尾）<br />就内义而言，此处论述的主题是重生后的属灵之善，描述了这善的性质。其属天-属灵的性质被描述为“踊跃如公羊的大山”，其属天-属世的性质被描述为“跳舞如羊羔的小山”，“大山”表爱的属天之物（参看<a href="795.htm">795</a>，<a href="1430.htm">1430</a>节）。谁都能看出，这些话，和诗篇其余的话一样，都包含神圣事物，不过，这神圣事物包含在内义中；“踊跃如公羊的大山”、“如羊羔的小山”、“在主的面前震动的大地”均表某种属灵之物。若没有内义，这些事物都是些毫无意义的话。<br />摩西书中的这些话也是如此：<br />耶和华使他乘驾地的高处，得吃田间的土产；又使他从磐石中咂蜜，从坚石中吸油；也吃牛的奶油、羊的奶、羊羔的脂油，就是巴珊所出的公绵羊和公山羊，与上好麦子的脂油，也喝未与酒混合的葡萄汁。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.13.htm">32:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.14.htm">14</a>）<br />此处“巴珊所出的公绵羊”表属天-属灵之物。至于何为属天-属灵之物，可参看前文（<a href="1824.htm">1824</a>节）。诗篇：<br />我要把肥牛作燔祭，连同公绵羊的馨香祭献给你，又把公牛和公山羊献上。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗66.15.htm">66:15</a>）<br />“肥牛的燔祭”表爱的属天之物，“公绵羊的馨香祭”表信的属灵之物。<br />以西结书：<br />亚拉伯人和基达的一切首领都是你手里的客商，用羊羔、公绵羊、公山羊与你交易。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.21.htm">27:21</a>）<br />这论述的是推罗，它表示那些具有对良善与真理的认知之人（<a href="1201.htm">1201</a>节）；“亚拉伯人”表他们的智慧；“基达的首领”表他们的聪明；“羊羔”表属天之物；“公绵羊”表属灵之物；“公山羊”表属世之物，它们依次而来。以赛亚书：<br />基达的羊群都必聚集到你这里，尼拜约的公绵羊要供你使用；它们必上我的祭坛蒙悦纳，我必荣美我荣美的殿。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.7.htm">60:7</a>）<br />这论述的是主的神性人；“基达的羊群”表神性属天之物；“尼拜约的公绵羊”表神性属灵之物。综上所述，明显可知“公绵羊”在内义上表主的神性属灵之物，并由此表人里面的属灵之物，或也可说人类中的属灵成员。</p>

And behold a ram. That this signifies the spiritual from the human race, is evident from the signification of a "ram," as explained in what follows. It is known within the church that the burnt-offerings 
and sacrifices in the representative Jewish and Israelitish Church signified the Lord's Divine Human; but the burnt-offerings and sacrifices from lambs signified one thing, those from sheep and she-goats 
another, and those also from kids, rams, and he-goats, and from oxen, bullocks, and calves, and from turtledoves and the young of pigeons, other things; and in like manner the meat-offerings 
and libations. In general they signified the Divine celestial, Divine spiritual, and Divine natural things which belong to the Lord; and hence they signified the celestial, spiritual, and natural things 
which are from Him in His kingdom, consequently in everyone who is a kingdom of the Lord; which may also be seen from the Holy Supper, which succeeded the burnt-offerings and sacrifices. The bread 
and wine therein signify the Lord's Divine Human; the bread His Divine celestial, and the wine His Divine spiritual; they consequently signify His love toward the universal human race; and on the other 
hand the love of the human race to the Lord (n. 2343, 2359). Hence it is manifest that the burnt-offerings and sacrifices involved celestial worship from love to the Lord, and spiritual worship from 
charity toward the neighbor and the derivative faith in the Lord (n. 922, 923, 1823, 2180). What the celestial is, and what the spiritual, or what are the celestial and the spiritual in the Lord's kingdom 
or in His church, has been frequently stated (see n. 1155, 1577, 1824, 2048, 2088, 2184, 2227, 2669, 2708, 2715).  [2] That a "ram" therefore signifies the Lord's Divine spiritual, and consequently 
the spiritual with man, or what is the same, those of the human race who are spiritual, may be seen from the burnt-offerings and sacrifices made from rams; in that when Aaron and his sons were sanctified 
to perform the ministry, that is, when they were inaugurated, they were to offer one bullock for sin, the blood of which was to be sprinkled upon the horns of the altar, and the rest poured at 
the bottom of it; also that one ram was to be killed, and his blood sprinkled round the altar, and then the whole ram was to be burnt for a burnt-offering; and that the blood of the other ram that was 
killed was to be sprinkled upon the tip of Aaron's ear, and upon the thumb of his hand and the great toe of his foot; and that after it was waved, it was to be burnt upon the burnt-offering (Exod. 
29:1-35; Lev. 8:1 to the end; 9:2 to the end). That all these rites were holy is evident; but they were holy from their representing and signifying holy things. Otherwise to slaughter a bullock and to 
sprinkle his blood upon the horns of the altar and pour the rest at its base, and to slaughter one ram and sprinkle his blood round the altar and then to burn him, and to sprinkle the blood of the other 
ram upon the tip of Aaron's ear and the thumb of his hand and the great toe of his foot, also to wave it, and to burn it upon the burnt-offering - all these things would have had no holiness and thus 
would have effected no worship unless they had represented holy things. But what each particular represented can be evident to no one except from the internal sense. That the bullock which was for 
sin signified the Lord's Divine natural, and the ram His Divine spiritual, and that it signified also those who are spiritual of the human race, may be seen from the signification of a "bullock" and 
a "ram" in the Word. Inaugurations into the priesthood were made by spiritual things, for by spiritual things a man is introduced into celestial things; or what is the same, by the truths of faith into 
the good of love. In like manner when Aaron entered into the holy place, he was to offer a bullock for sin, and a ram for a burnt-offering (Lev. 16:2, 3).  [3] That the Nazirite, when the days of his 
Naziriteship were fulfilled, was to offer a whole lamb a son of a year, for a burnt-offering, and one ewe-lamb a daughter of a year, entire, for sin, and one whole ram for peace-offerings (Num. 6:13-17), 
was because the Nazirite represented the celestial man, who is a likeness of the Lord (n. 51, 52, 1013). The celestial man is such that he is in celestial love, that is, in love to the Lord, and 
thence in celestial truth (n. 202, 337, 2069, 2715, 2718); he was therefore to sacrifice a lamb and a ewe-lamb, by which the celestial was signified; and also a ram, by which the spiritual was signified. 
At the festivals, bullocks, rams, and lambs were sacrificed-as on the first day of the feast of the unleavened bread, two bullocks, one ram, and seven lambs, with their meat-offering, for a burnt-offering 
(Num. 28:18-20). On the day of the firstfruits also, two bullocks, one ram, and seven lambs, with their meat-offering, for a burnt-offering (Num. 28:26-25). On the new moons, two bullocks, 
one ram, and seven lambs, with their meat-offering, for a burnt-offering (Num. 28:11, 12). In the seventh month, on the first of the month, one bullock, one ram, and seven lambs, with their meat-offering. 
On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, thirteen bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs. (See also Num. 29:1, 2, 12-14, 17, 18, 20-22, 24, 26-36.) The "bullocks" and the "rams" signified spiritual 
things, but the "lambs" celestial things; for at the feasts they had to be sanctified and introduced by spiritual things.  [4] As "rams" signified the Divine spiritual of the Lord's Divine Human, 
as also the spiritual things with man, therefore where the new temple and New Jerusalem, that is, the Lord's spiritual kingdom, is spoken of, it is said in Ezekiel, that when they had made an end of 
cleansing the altar there, they were to offer a bullock for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, and were to offer the goat of the sin-offering every day for seven days, and a bullock and 
a ram (Ezek. 43:23-25); and that on this day the prince should prepare the bullock of the sin-offering for all the people, and on the seven days of the feast seven bullocks, and seven rams, with the meat-offering, 
for a burnt-offering (Ezek. 45:22-24); and that on the day of the sabbath he should prepare six lambs and a ram (Ezek. 46:4, 6).  [5] That by the new temple and the New Jerusalem in the 
universal sense is signified the Lord's kingdom, may be seen above (n. 402, 940); in particular the New Church (n. 2117). That there are not burnt-offerings and sacrifices there, may be known to everyone, 
which shows that by these are signified the celestial things of love, and the spiritual things of faith; for these are of the Lord's kingdom; and thus such things are here signified by "bullocks," 
"rams," and "lambs." That "bullocks" and "rams" signify spiritual things, is evident from the several particulars in the internal sense; in general from this, that by the "new temple" and the "New 
Jerusalem" the Lord's spiritual kingdom is specifically signified, but by "Zion" the celestial kingdom.  [6] That a "ram" signifies that which is spiritual, or what is the same, those who are spiritual, 
is plain also in Daniel; in that a ram was seen by him standing before the river, which had two horns; afterwards a he-goat of the goats, which smote him, broke his horns, and trampled him down (Dan. 
8:3, 4, and the following verses); where nothing else is meant by the "ram" than the spiritual church, and by the "he-goat of the goats" than those who are in faith separated from charity, or in truth 
separate from good, who by successive steps uplift themselves against good, and at length against the Lord-which is also described. In Samuel: </p>
<p>     Samuel said to Saul, Hath Jehovah as great pleasure 
in burnt-offerings and sacrifices as in hearkening to the voice of Jehovah? Behold to hearken is better than sacrifice, and to obey than the fat of rams (1 Sam. 15:22); </p>
<p>where because obedience 
is treated of, so is truth, which is spiritual; and these words were said to the king, by whom also is signified truth (n. 1672, 2015, 2069). It is not therefore said, "better than the fat of oxen," or 
of "lambs," but "better than the fat of rams."  [7] In David: </p>
<p>     When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language, Judah became His sanctuary, Israel His dominion. 
The sea saw it, and fled, and the Jordan turned back; the mountains leaped like rams, the hills like the sons of the flock. What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleest? thou Jordan, that thou 
turnest back; ye mountains, that ye skip like rams? ye hills, like the sons of the flock? Thou travailest, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob, who turned the rock 
into a pool of waters, and the flint into a fountain of waters (Ps. 114:1 to the end); </p>
<p>here in the internal sense the subject treated of is spiritual good after regeneration, and it is described in 
respect to its quality; its celestial spiritual by the "mountains leaping like rams;" and its celestial natural by the "hills like the sons of the flock." (That "mountains" are the celestial things of 
love, may be seen above, n. 795, 1430.) Everyone may know that in these, as in the rest of the words of David, there are holy things, but in the internal sense; and that something is signified by the 
mountains skipping like rams, and the hills like the sons of the flock, and by the earth travailing at the presence of the Lord; which things, without the internal sense, are words of no meaning.  [8] 
So with these words in Moses: </p>
<p>     He maketh him ride on the high places of the earth, and to eat the increase of the earth, and He maketh him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flint 
of the rock; butter of kine and milk of the flock, with fat of lambs, and of rams the sons of Bashan, and he-goats with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and of the blood of grapes thou shalt drink unmixed 
wine (Deut. 32:13-14); </p>
<p>"rams the sons of Bashan" denotes celestial spiritual things (what celestial spiritual things are, may be seen above, n. 1824). In David: </p>
<p>     I will offer unto Thee burnt-offerings 
of fatlings with the incense of rams, I will offer bullocks with goats (Ps. 66:15); </p>
<p>"burnt-offerings of fatlings" denotes the celestial things of love; and the "incense of rams," the spiritual 
things of faith.  [9] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Arabia and all the princes of Kedar were the merchants of thy hand: in lambs, in rams, and he-goats (Ezek. 27:21); </p>
<p>where Tyre is treated of, by which those 
are signified who are in the knowledges of good and truth (n. 1201); "Arabia" denotes their wisdom; the "princes of Kedar," their intelligence; "lambs," celestial things; "rams," spiritual things; 
and "he-goats," natural things, which follow in order. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     All the flock of Kedar shall be gathered together unto Thee, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto Thee; they shall come up 
with acceptance on Mine altar, and I will adorn the house of My adornment (Isa. 60:7); </p>
<p>here the Lord's Divine Human is treated of; the "flock of Kedar" denotes Divine celestial things; and the "rams 
of Nebaioth," Divine spiritual things. From all this it is now evident that a "ram" in the internal sense signifies the Lord's Divine spiritual, and hence the spiritual in men, or what is the same, those 
of the human race who are spiritual. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2830</b></p><p><b>2830.</b>
'And behold, a ram' means spiritual members of the human race. This is clear from the meaning of 'a ram', dealt with below. Within the Church it is well known that the burnt offerings and sacrifices 
in the representative Jewish and Israelite Church meant the Lord's Divine Human. But the burnt offerings and sacrifices of the lambs meant one thing, those of sheep and she-goats another, and those of 
kids, rams, and he-goats, of oxen, young bulls, and calves, and of turtle doves and young pigeons meant yet other things, as also did the minchahs and drink offerings. In general these things that were 
sacrificed meant the Divine celestial, Divine spiritual, and Divine natural things which are the Lord's; and from meaning these they meant celestial, spiritual, and natural things which exist from 
Him within His kingdom, and so within every individual who is the Lord's kingdom. This may be seen also from the Holy Supper which superseded burnt offerings and sacrifices. In it the bread and the wine 
mean the Lord's Divine Human - the Bread His Divine celestial, the Wine His Divine spiritual - and consequently mean His love towards the whole human race, and in turn the love of the whole human race 
for the Lord, <a href="2343.htm">2343</a>, <a href="2359.htm">2359</a>. From this it is evident that burnt offerings and sacrifices contained within them celestial worship springing from love to the Lord, and spiritual worship springing from 
charity towards the neighbour, and therefore from faith in the Lord, <a href="922.htm">922</a>, <a href="923.htm">923</a>, <a href="1823.htm">1823</a>, <a href="2180.htm">2180</a>. What the celestial is and what the spiritual is, that is, who constitute the celestial members and who the spiritual 
within the Lord's kingdom or Church, has been stated rather often, see <a href="1155.htm">1155</a>, <a href="1577.htm">1577</a>, <a href="1824.htm">1824</a>, <a href="2048.htm">2048</a>, <a href="2088.htm">2088</a>, <a href="2184.htm">2184</a>, <a href="2227.htm">2227</a>, <a href="2669.htm">2669</a>, <a href="2708.htm">2708</a>, <a href="2715.htm">2715</a>. </p>

 That 'a ram' then means the Lord's Divine spiritual, and 
so that which is spiritual with man, or what amounts to the same, spiritual members of the human race, may become clear from the burnt offerings and sacrifices that were made from rams. For example, 
when Aaron and his sons were consecrated to the function they performed, that is, when they were inaugurated, they were to offer one young bull for a sin offering, sprinkle its blood over the horns 
of the altar, and pour the remainder at the base of it. Also they were to slaughter one ram and to sprinkle its blood around the altar, and after that they were to burn the ram - the whole of it - as 
a burnt offering. And the blood of the second ram which had been slaughtered was to be sprinkled over the tip of Aaron's ear, and over his thumb and big toe, and after that they were to make a wave offering 
of it and burn it on top of the burnt offering, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2029:%201-35&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 29: 1-35</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%208:%201-end;%209:%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 8: 1-end; 9: 2</a> and following verses. Clearly all these observances were holy, but they were holy for the reason that they represented 
and meant holy things. Other than for this reason, none of these observances - slaughtering a young bull, sprinkling its blood over the horns of the altar and pouring the remainder at the base 
of it, slaying one ram and sprinkling its blood around the altar and after that burning it, and sprinkling the blood of the second ram over the tip of Aaron's ear and over his thumb and big toe and 
also making a wave offering of it and burning it on top of the burnt offering - would have possessed any holiness, nor thus any worship, unless they had represented holy things. But what each observance 
represented does not become clear to anyone except from the internal sense. That the young bull offered as a sin offering meant the Lord's Divine natural, and the ram His Divine spiritual, and at 
the same time spiritual members of the human race, may become clear from the meaning of a young bull and of a ram in the Word. Inaugurations into the priesthood were effected by means of spiritual things, 
for by means of spiritual things man is initiated into those which are celestial, or what amounts to the same, by means of the truths of faith he is initiated into good that stems from love. In a 
similar way when Aaron entered the Holy Place he was to offer a young bull as a sin offering and a ram as a burnt offering, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2016:%202,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 16: 2, 3</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 When a Nazirite was completing the period of his Naziriteship 
he was to offer one male lamb a year old without a blemish as a burnt offering, and one ewe-lamb a year old without a blemish as a sin offering, and one ram without blemish as a peace offering, 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%206:%2013,%2014,%2016,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 6: 13, 14, 16, 17</a>. The reason for these observances was that a Nazirite represented the celestial man, who is the likeness of the Lord, <a href="51.htm">51</a>, <a href="52.htm">52</a>,<a href="1013.htm">1013</a>. The celestial man is such that he is moved 
by celestial love, that is, by love to the Lord, and from this by celestial truth, <a href="202.htm">202</a>, <a href="337.htm">337</a>, <a href="2069.htm">2069</a>, <a href="2715.htm">2715</a>, <a href="2718.htm">2718</a>. This was why the Nazirite was required to sacrifice a male lamb and a ewe-lamb, meaning that 
which is celestial, and also to sacrifice a ram, meaning that which is spiritual. Young bulls, rams, and lambs were sacrificed at festivals. For example, on the first day of the feast of unleavened 
bread, two young bulls, one ram, and seven lambs, together with their minchah, were to be offered as a burnt offering, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2028:%2018-20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 28: 18-20</a>. On the day of the firstfruits too, two-young bulls, one ram, and 
seven lambs, together with their minchah, were to be offered as a burnt offering, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2028:%2026-28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 28: 26-28</a>. At new moons two young bulls, one ram, and seven lambs, together with their minchah, were to be offered 
as a burnt offering, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2028:%2011,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 28: 11, 12</a>; in the seventh month, on the first of the month, one young bull, one ram, seven lambs, together with their minchah; and on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, 
thirteen young bulls, two rams, fourteen lambs; and so on, see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2029:%201,%202,%2012-14,%2017,%2018,%2020-24,%2026-36&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 29: 1, 2, 12-14, 17, 18, 20-24, 26-36</a>. Young bulls and rams meant spiritual things, while lambs meant celestial. For at festivals 
it was required that those taking part were to be sanctified and were brought into that condition by means of spiritual things. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Since 'rams' meant the Divine spiritual of the Lord's Divine Human, 
and also spiritual things residing with man, it is therefore said in Ezekiel, where the New Temple and the New Jerusalem, that is, the Lord's spiritual kingdom, are referred to, that when they had 
finished cleansing the altar they were to offer a young bull as a sin offering and a ram as a burnt offering; and for seven days they were to provide daily a he-goat for a sin offering, and a young 
bull and a ram, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2043:%2023-25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 43: 23-25</a>. Also 'on that day' the prince on behalf of all the people was to provide a young bull for a sin offering, and on the seven days of the feast seven young bulls and seven 
rams, together with the minchah, as a burnt offering, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2045:%2022-24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 45: 22-24</a>; and on the sabbath day he was to provide six lambs and a ram, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2046:%204;%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 46: 4; 6</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 As regards the New Temple and the New Jerusalem, 
these in the universal sense mean the Lord's kingdom, see <a href="402.htm">402</a>, <a href="940.htm">940</a>, and in particular a new Church, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>. There neither burnt offerings nor sacrifices are offered, as may be well known to all; 
and from this it is evident that burnt offerings and sacrifices mean the celestial things of love and the spiritual things of faith; for these things belong to the Lord's kingdom, and so are akin to 
the things meant here by young bulls, rams, and lambs. As regards the young bulls and rams, these mean spiritual things, as is clear from each detail in this part of Ezekiel in the internal sense - in 
general from the fact that specifically the New Temple and the New Jerusalem mean the Lord's spiritual kingdom, while Zion means the celestial kingdom. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 That 'a ram' means that which is spiritual, 
or what amounts to the same, those who are spiritual, is also evident in Daniel. Daniel saw a ram with two horns which was standing before the river; and then he saw a he-goat which struck the ram, 
broke its horns, and trampled on it, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%208:%203,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 8: 3, 4</a>, and following verses. Here 'the ram' is used to mean nothing else than the spiritual Church, and 'the he-goat' to mean those who are governed by faith 
separated from charity, that is, by truth separated from good, and who step by step rise up against what is good, and finally against the Lord - as is also described. In Samuel, </p>
<p>Samuel said to 
Saul, Does Jehovah delight as greatly in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in hearkening to the voice of Jehovah? Behold, to hearken is better than sacrifice, and to obey than the fat of rams. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1%20Sam%2015:%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">1 Sam 15: 22</a>. </p>
<p>Here, since it is obedience - and so truth, which is spiritual - that is spoken of, and since what was said was addressed to the king - who also means truth, <a href="1672.htm">1672</a>, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="2069.htm">2069</a> - the words used 
are not therefore 'better than the fat of oxen (or of lambs)' but 'better than the fat of rams'.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 In David, </p>
<blockquote>
When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a foreign people, Judah 
became His sanctuary, Israel His dominions. The sea looked and fled, and Jordan turned itself backwards. The mountains skipped like rams, the hills like the young of the flock. What ails you, O sea, that 
you flee? O Jordan, that you turn yourself backwards? O mountains, that you skip like rams? O hills, like the young of the flock? At the presence of the Lord, you are in labour, O earth; at the presence 
of the God of Jacob, who turns the rock into a pool of water, and the flint into a fountain of water. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20114:%201-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 114: 1-end</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers in the internal sense to spiritual good following regeneration 
and describes the nature of that good. The celestial-spiritual nature of it is described as the mountains skipping like rams, and the celestial-natural as hills doing so like the young of the flock 
- 'mountains' meaning the celestial things of love, see <a href="795.htm">795</a>, <a href="1430.htm">1430</a>. Anyone may see that these words, like all the rest of David's, contain matters that are holy, but within the internal sense, and that 
something spiritual is meant by the mountains skipping like rams, and the hills like the young of the flock, and by the earth going into labour at the presence of the Lord. Without the internal sense 
they would be expressions devoid of any real meaning. </p>

<p><b>[8]</b>
 Much the same applies to the following in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
He will cause him to ride over the heights of the land, and will cause him to eat the 
produce of the land, and will cause him to suck honey out of the crag, and oil out of the flinty rock - butter from the cattle, and milk from the flock, with the fat of lambs and rams, the breed<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of 
Bashan, and of goats, with the kidney-fat of wheat; and of the blood of the grape you will drink unmixed wine. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2032:%2013-15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 32: 13-15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Rams, the breed of Bashan' stands for celestial-spiritual things. As 
to what celestial-spiritual things are, see <a href="1824.htm">1824</a>. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
I will offer to You burnt offerings of things full of marrow, with the incense of rams; I will provide ox with he-goats. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2066:%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 66: 15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Burnt 
offerings of things full of marrow' stands for the celestial things of love, 'incense of rams' for the spiritual things of faith. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Arabia and all the princes of Kedar, these 
were the merchants of your hand in lambs, in rams and he- goats. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2027:%2021&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 27: 21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Tyre, which means those with whom cognitions of good and truth exist, <a href="1201.htm">1201</a>. 'Arabia' stands for their 
wisdom, 'princes of Kedar' for their intelligence, 'lambs' for celestial things, 'rams' for spiritual things, 'he-goats' for natural things, which come in order one after another. In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The whole 
flock of Kedar will be gathered to You, the rams of Nebaioth will minister to You; they will come up with acceptance on My altar, and I will beautify My beautiful house. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2060:%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 60: 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers 
to the Lord's Divine Human. 'The flock of Kedar' stands for Divine celestial things, 'the rams of Nebaioth' for Divine spiritual things. From all these references it may now become clear that 'a ram' 
in the internal sense means the Lord's Divine spiritual; and from this it means that which is spiritual with man, or what amounts to the same, it means spiritual members of the human race.

spiritualia, `agni' vero caelestia; nam in festis sanctificari debebant, et per spiritualia introduci {13}.  [4] Quia `arietes' {14}significabant Divinum Spirituale Divini Humani Domini, {15}tum 
spiritualia apud hominem, ideo ubi agitur de Novo Templo et de Nova Hierosolyma hoc est, de regno spirituali Domini, dicitur apud Ezechielem,           Cum ibi absolveris expiare altare, offerrent

et sacrificia, cuivis notum esse potest; inde patet quod per illa significentur caelestia quae sunt amoris, et spiritualia quae sunt fidei, nam haec sunt regni Domini ita hic {16}similia per 
juvencos, arietes, agnos; quod `juvenci et arietes' significent spiritualia, constat ex singulis ibi in sensu interno, genere ex eo quod per `Novum Templum' et `Novam Hierosolymam' significetur in specie 
regnum spirituale Domini, per `Zionem' autem regnum caeleste. [6] Quod `aries' significet spirituale, seu quod idem est spirituales, patet etiam apud Danielem,           Quod illi visus aries, stans 
ante flumen, cui duo       cornua;... dein hircus caprarum,...qui illum percussit, fregit      cornua ejus, et conculcavit, viii 3, 4 seq.; </p>
<p>ubi per `arietem' non aliud intelligitur quam Ecclesia 
spiritualis per `hircum caprarum' illi qui sunt in fide separata a charitate, in vero separato a bono, qui successive se extollunt contra bonum et demum contra Dominum, quod etiam describitur: apud 
Samuelem,           Samuel dixit ad Shaulem, Num complacet Jehovae in       holocaustis et sacrificiis, sicut auscultando voci Jehovae?      ecce auscultare prae sacrificio bonum, et oboedire prae 
adipe      arietum, I Sam. xv 22; </p>
<p>ubi quia agitur de oboedientia, ita de vero quod est spirituale, et illa erant ad regem per quem etiam verum significatur, n. 1672, 2015, 2069, ideo non dicitur prae 
adipe boum seu agnorum, sed `prae adipe arietum': [7] apud Davidem,            Cum exiret Israel ex Aegypto, domus Jacobi e barbarico,      factus est Jehudah in sanctuarium ejus, Israel dominia ejus; </p>
<p> 
    mare vidit et fugit, et Jordan avertit se retrorsum, montes      saltaverunt sicut arietes, colles sicut filii gregis.  Quid      tibi mare quod fugias, Jordan avertas te retrorsum? Montes  
    saltetis sicut arietes, colles sicut filii gregis?  A coram      Domino parturis terra, a coram Deo Jacobi, Qui convertit      petram in lacum aquarum, et silicem in fontem {17}ejus      aquarum, 
Ps. cxiv 1-fin.; </p>
<p>agitur ibi in sensu interno de bono spirituali post regenerationem, et describitur quale est, ejus caeleste spirituale per `montes quod saltaverint sicut arietes,' et caeleste 
naturale per quod `colles sicut filii gregis'; quod `montes' sint caelestia quae amoris, videatur n. 795, 1430; {18}quisque scire potest quod in his, sicut in ceteris Davidis, sancta sint, sed in sensu 
interno, et quod aliquid significet, quod `montes saltaverint sicut arietes, et colles sicut filii gregis,' et quod `coram Domino parturiat terra,' quae absque sensu interno sunt voces nullius rei: 
[8] similiter etiam haec, apud Mosen,           Equitare faciet eum super excelsis terrae, et comedere      faciet proventus terrae, et sugere faciet mel e rupe, et oleum      e silice petrae, butyrum 
armenti, et lac gregis, cum adipe      agnorum, et arietum filiorum Bashanis, et hircorum, cum adipe      renum tritici, et sanguinem uvarum bibes merum, Deut. xxxii      13-15; </p>
<p>`arietes filii 
Bashanis' pro caelestibus spiritualibus; quid caelestia spiritualia, videatur n. 1824: apud Davidem,                     Holocausta medullatorum offeram Tibi cum suffitu      arietum, faciam bovem 
cum hircis, Ps. lxvi 15; </p>
<p>`holocausta medullatorum' pro caelestibus quae sunt amoris, `suffitus arietum' pro spiritualibus quae sunt fidei: [9] apud Ezechielem,           Arabia et omnes principes 
Kedar, hi negotiatores manus      tuae, in agnis, in arietibus et hircis, xxvii 21;     ubi de `Tyro,' per quam significantur illi qui in cognitionibus boni et veri sunt, n. 1201; `Arabia' pro sapientia 
eorum, `principes Kedar' pro intelligentia eorundem, `agni' pro caelestibus, `arietes' pro spiritualibus, `hirci' pro naturalibus, quae ordine succedunt: apud Esaiam,                            Omnis 
grex Kedar congregabuntur Tibi, arietes Nebaioth      ministrabunt Tibi, ascendent ad beneplacitum altare Meum, et      domum decoris Mei decorabo, lx 7; </p>
<p>ibi de Domini Divino Humano; `grex Kedar' 
pro Divinis caelestibus `arietes Nebaioth' pro Divinis spiritualibus.  Ex his omnibus nunc constare potest quod `aries' in sensu interno significet Divinum Spirituale Domini, et inde spirituale
