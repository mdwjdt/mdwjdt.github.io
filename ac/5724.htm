<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5724节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5724.</strong>脑里面有些粘性物质混杂了某种灵性或赋予生命的东西。一旦这些物质从脑血液中排出，它们首先进入脑膜中间，然后进入纤维中间；其中一部分进入大的脑室，依此类推。通过对应与这些有某种灵性或赋予生命的东西在里面的粘性物质有关的灵人出现在头部中间几乎正上方相当远的距离处。这些灵人具有这样的性质：他们出于在肉身生活期间所获得的习惯激起良心的愧疚，在良心不起作用的地方引入这种愧疚，造成扰乱，以这种方式使简单人的良心负担过重。他们也不知道什么事应该成为良心的事，而是把所发生的一切都当成良心的事。这些灵人在横膈膜下面的腹部引发一种焦虑感。他们也出现在试探中，注入有时难以忍受的焦虑。他们当中那些对应于不怎么赋予生命的粘痰的灵人将人的思维固定在这些焦虑上。此外，当我与他们交谈，好叫我知道这些灵人的品质时，他们试图以种种方式使人的良心负担过重。这样做是他们生活的快乐；我被引导发现他们无法注意情理，也不能更全面地看待事情，以使他们能从中审视细节。</p>

There are in the brain viscidities in which is mingled something spirituous or vital, and these viscidities, expelled from the blood there, fall first among the meninges, then among the fibers, part 
of them into the great ventricles of the brain, and so on. The spirits who relate by correspondence to those viscidities which have something spirituous or some life in them, appear almost directly above 
the middle of the head at a mid distance, and are such that from habit acquired in the life of the body they stir scruples of conscience, and intrude in matters of no conscience, and in this way burden 
the conscience of the simple. Nor do they know what ought to engage the conscience, but make everything that occurs a matter of conscience. Such spirits induce a sensible anxiety in the part of 
the abdomen beneath the region of the diaphragm. They are also present in temptations, and inject anxieties, at times unbearable. Those of them who correspond to the viscous phlegm of less vitality then 
keep the thought fixed in these anxieties. Moreover, when I have been in discourse with them, in order to know their quality, they tried in various ways to burden the conscience. This had been the 
delight of their life; and it was given me to notice that they cannot attend to reasons, and that they do not possess that more universal view of things that would enable them to see the singular ones. </p>

In the brain there are viscous substances that have something spirituous or life-giving mixed into them. Once those substances have been expelled from the blood in the brain, they first of all move in 
among the meninges, then among the fibres; some of them move into the large ventricles in the brain, and so on. The spirits who are related by correspondence to those viscous substances that have something 
spirituous or life-giving in them are seen almost directly above the middle of the head, a fair distance away. They are the kind who, from habit acquired during their lifetime, raise conscientious 
objections, introducing them where conscience has no part to play, and thereby over-burdening the consciences of simple persons. They are unaware of what ought to be a matter of conscience; for they 
bring conscience into everything that happens to them. These spirits also introduce a feeling of anxiety that is located in the abdomen underneath the diaphragm. They are present too in temptations, 
introducing feelings of anxiety that are sometimes unbearable. Those among them who correspond to phlegm that is not so life-giving keep a person's thought fixed on such anxious feelings. I have also 
been with them in their discussions so that I might know what those spirits were like. They try by various methods to over-burden a person's conscience. To do this had been the delight of their lives, 
and I was led to observe that they could not pay attention to reasons presented to them, and that they were unable to take the overall view of things from which they might then look at specific details.  </p>

Sunt in cerebro viscosa quibus immixtum aliquid spirituosum seu   vitale, quae viscosa e sanguine ibi expuncta incidunt primum inter meninges, dein inter {1}fibras, pars eorum in ventriculos  {2]magnos 
in cerebro, et sic porro; spiritus qui ad viscosa illa in quibus aliquid spirituosi [3]seu aliquid vitae est, referuntur correspondenter; apparent supra medium caput directe fere, ad mediam distantiam, 
et tales sunt {4}ut ex more in vita corporis, scrupulos conscientiae moveant et insinuent in rebus nullius conscientiae, ita aggravant conscientiam simplicium, nec sciunt quid conscientiam {5}movere 
debeat, in omni quod obvenit, conscientiam ponentes.  Tales etiam anxietatem sensibilem inducunt parti abdominis sub regione diaphragmatis; in tentationibus etiam adsunt et anxietates inferunt quandoque 
intolerabiles; {6}qui illorum' phlegmati viscoso minus vitali correspondent, cogitationem tunc inhaerenter tenent in anxiis illis.  Cum illis etiam in sermone fui ut scirem quales essent; tentabant 
variis modis aggravare conscientiam; hoc jucundum vitae eorum fuerat, et observare datum quod non possent ad rationes attendere, et quod (t)illis non esset {7}rerum universalior intuitio, a qua
