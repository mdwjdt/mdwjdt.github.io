<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第725节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>725.</strong>“公与母”表示真理与良善。这一点从前面所述明显可知，即“男”与“公”表示真理，“妻”与“母”表示良善。然而，“公与母”论及觉知之物，而“男与妻”则论及意愿之物。因为男人与妻子代表婚姻，而公与母则不然。真理凭自己无法进入与良善的婚姻，而良善却能凭自己进入与真理的婚姻。不是良善的产物、并以此与良善结合的真理，从来就不曾存在过。若从真理那里拿走良善，就只剩下一堆空话。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]725.</strong> The symbolism of a male and a female as truth and goodness is established by statements made and evidence offered earlier to the effect that a man and a male symbolize truth while a wife and a woman symbolize good.{*1} Male and female are used of what belongs to the intellect, however, whereas man and wife are used of what belongs to the will. This is because a husband and wife represent marriage in a way that male and female do not. Truth acting on its own is completely unable to enter into marriage with goodness — it is possible only for goodness to join with truth — because no truth whatever exists that does not grow out of goodness and so is not coupled with goodness. If you extract goodness from truth, nothing remains but mere words.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the symbolism of a man or male, and of a wife or a woman, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_725/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_718" target=_top>718</a> and the sections referred to in note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_725/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_718" target=_top>718</a>.

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 725</b></p><p><b>725.</b>
That by "male and female" are signified truths and goods, is evident from what has been said and shown before, namely, that "man" and "male" signify truth, and "wife" and "female" good. But "male and 
female" are predicated of things of the understanding, and "man and wife" of things of the will, for the reason that marriage is represented by man and wife, and not so much by male and female. For truth 
can never of itself enter into marriage with good, but good can with truth; because there is no truth which is not produced from good and thus coupled with good. If you withdraw good from truth, 
nothing whatever remains but words. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 725</b></p><p><b>725.</b>
'Male and female' means truths and goods. This becomes clear from what has been stated and shown already about 'male' (vir) and 'male' (masculus) meaning truth, and 'mate' (uxor) and 'female' (femina) 
meaning good. 'Male and female' however has reference to things of the understanding, while 'male and mate'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> has reference to those of the will, the reason being that 'male and mate' represents marriage 
more than 'male and female' does. In fact, by itself truth cannot possibly enter into marriage with good; but good does so with truth, for no truth ever exists which is not the product of good and 
is in this way coupled to good. Take away good from truth and nothing remains whatever but mere words.

</p><b>725.</b>
Quod per 'masculum et feminam' significentur vera et bona, constare ab illis potest quae prius dicta et ostensa sunt, quod 'vir et masculus' significet verum, 'uxor et femina' bonum; sed 'masculus et 
femina' praedicatur de intellectualibus, at 'vir et uxor' de voluntariis, ex causa quod per virum et uxorem repraesentetur conjugium, non ita per masculum et feminam; verum enim nusquam potest ex se 
conjugium inire cum bono, sed bonum cum vero; quia nusquam datur aliquod verum quod non producitur a bono, et sic bono copulatur; si abstrahis bonum a vero, remanet nihil quicquam praeter voces. </p>
