<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4610节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4610.</strong>“这些是雅各的儿子，他是在巴旦亚兰给他生的”表它们的起源和它们此时的状态。这从关于雅各儿子们总体和具体的阐述清楚可知，即：他们表示总体上主的神性属世层里面的全部事物（<a href="4603.htm">4603</a>节），以致所有这些事物合在一起由现在的“雅各”来表示。它们的起源由他们生在巴旦亚兰，也就是生在对真理与良善的认知来表示，因为这些认知由“巴旦亚兰”来表示（<a href="3664.htm">3664</a>，<a href="3680.htm">3680</a>节）。由于所有这些合在一起由现在的“雅各”来表示，故在原文，经上在说“他是在巴旦亚兰给他生的”时，用的是单数形式。接下来所论述的主题是神性属世层与神性理性层的联结。这种联结由雅各来到他父亲那里来表示。</p>

These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan-aram. That this signifies their origin and their present state, is evident from what has already been said of the sons of Jacob both in general 
and specifically, namely, that by them are signified all things in the Lord's Divine natural in general (n. 4603), insomuch that all these things taken together are now "Jacob." Their origin is signified 
by their being born in Paddan-aram, or from the knowledges of truth and good, for these are signified by "Paddan-aram" (n. 3664, 3680). As all of these taken together are now "Jacob," it is therefore 
said in the original language, "who was born to him," in the singular. In what now follows the subject treated of is the conjunction of the Divine natural with the Divine rational. This conjunction 
is represented by Jacob's coming to Isaac his father. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4610</b></p><p><b>4610.</b>
'These are the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan Aram' means the origin and state of these at this point. This is clear from what has now been stated generally and specifically about the sons 
of Jacob, namely that in general they mean all things which were now present in the Lord's Divine Natural, <a href="4603.htm">4603</a>, so much so that all those things taken together are now meant by 'Jacob'. Where they 
originate is meant by the words 'born to him in Paddan Aram', that is, in cognitions of truth and good, these being meant by Paddan Aram, <a href="3664.htm">3664</a>, <a href="3680.htm">3680</a>. And because all taken together are now meant by 
'Jacob', the singular 'who was born to him' is therefore used in the original language. In what follows next the subject is the joining of the Divine Natural to the Divine Rational, that joining together 
being represented by Jacob's coming to his father Isaac. </p>

`Hi filii Jacobi qui nati illi in Paddan Aram': quod significet originem et statum eorum nunc, constat ex illis quae de filiis Jacobi in genere et in specie nunc dicta sunt, quod nempe per illo, 
significata sint in communi omnia quae in Divino Naturali Domini, n. 4603, adeo ut illa simul sumpta nunc sint `Jacobus': </p>
<p>origo eorum significatur per quod `nati illi in Paddan Aram', seu ex cognitionibus 
veri et boni, hae enim per Paddan Aram significantur n. 3664, 3680; quia omnia simul sumpta nunc sunt `Jacobus', ideo in lingua originali dicitur, `qui {1} natus illi', in singulari.  In nunc 
sequentibus agitur de conjunctione Divini Naturalis cum Divino Rationali; conjunctio illa per adventum Jacobi ad Jishakum patrem suum repraesentatur.      @1 quo I$ </p>
