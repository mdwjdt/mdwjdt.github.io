<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3905节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3905.</strong>“拉结见自己不给雅各生子”表内在真理尚未得到承认。这从“拉结”和“雅各”的代表，以及“生子”的含义清楚可知：“拉结”是指对内在真理的情感，或内在真理本身（<a href="3758.htm">3758</a>，<a href="3782.htm">3782</a>，<a href="3793.htm">3793</a>，<a href="3819.htm">3819</a>节）；“生子”是指在信仰和行为上承认，如下文所述；“雅各”是指属世真理的良善（如<a href="3669.htm">3669</a>，<a href="3677.htm">3677</a>，<a href="3829.htm">3829</a>节，以及整个前一章所述）。“生子”之所以是指在信仰与行为上承认，是因为在圣言中，“生产”表示属灵的生产（<a href="1145.htm">1145</a>，<a href="1255.htm">1255</a>，<a href="3860.htm">3860</a>，<a href="3868.htm">3868</a>节）。属灵的生产就是对真理与良善的承认与信仰；此处信仰与行为上的承认，即对内在真理的承认由“拉结”来代表。由于在此人照信仰生活之前，没有什么东西能在信仰上得到承认，因此我们才说“信仰和行为上的承认”。只是为了知道它们，而不是为了行出来所学到的信之真理会与邪恶与虚假的情感联结；由于这个原因，对学习它们，内心却与信仰背道而驰的人来说，它们并不是信之真理。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3905</b></p><p><b>3905.</b>
And Rachel saw that she did not bear to Jacob. That this signifies that interior truth was not yet acknowledged, is evident from the representation of Rachel, as being the affection of interior truth, 
or interior truth itself (n. 3758, 3782, 3793, 3819); from the signification of "bearing," as being to acknowledge in faith and also in act (concerning which below); and from the representation of Jacob, 
as being the good of natural truth (of which n. 3669, 3677, 3829, and in the whole of the preceding chapter). The reason why "to bear" is to acknowledge in faith and also in act, is that by "births" 
in the Word are signified spiritual births (n. 1145, 1255, 3860, 3868). Spiritual birth is the acknowledgment of and faith in truth and good; here, the acknowledgment in faith and also in act, namely, 
of the interior truth represented by Rachel. As nothing is acknowledged in faith until the man lives according to it, it is for this reason said, "the acknowledgment in faith and also in act." Truths 
of faith which are not learned for the sake of doing, but only for the sake of knowing them, join themselves to the affections of evil and falsity; for which reason they are not of faith with the 
man who has learned them, but are interiorly contrary to faith. </p>

'Rachel saw that she was not bearing Jacob [any children]' means that interior truth was not yet acknowledged. This is clear from the representation of 'Rachel' as the affection for interior truth, or 
as interior truth itself, dealt with in <a href="3758.htm">3758</a>, <a href="3782.htm">3782</a>, <a href="3793.htm">3793</a>, <a href="3819.htm">3819</a>; from the meaning of 'bearing' as acknowledging in action as well as in faith, dealt with below; and from the representation of 'Jacob' 
as the good of natural truth, dealt with in <a href="3669.htm">3669</a>, <a href="3677.htm">3677</a>, <a href="3829.htm">3829</a>, and in the whole of the previous chapter. The reason why 'bearing' means acknowledging in action as well as in faith is that births in the 
Word mean spiritual births, <a href="1145.htm">1145</a>, <a href="1255.htm">1255</a>, <a href="3860.htm">3860</a>, <a href="3868.htm">3868</a>. Spiritual birth is the acknowledgement of and faith in truth and good, in this verse acknowledgement in action as well as in faith, that is to say, 
an acknowledgement of the interior truth represented by 'Rachel'. Since something is not acknowledged in faith until a person is living according to it the phrase 'acknowledgement in action as well 
as in faith' is therefore used. Truths of faith which are not learned for the sake of putting them into action but solely for the sake of knowing them attach themselves to affections for evil and falsity, 
and as a consequence are not the truths of faith with the person who learns them but within him go against faith. </p>

</p><b>3905.</b>
`Vidit Rachel quod non pareret Jacobo': quod significet quod nondum interius verum agnitum, constat a repraesentatione `Rachelis' quod sit affectio veri interioris seu verum interius, de qua n. 3758, 
3782, 3793, 3819; ex significatione `parere' quod sit agnoscere fide tum actu, de qua sequitur; et ex repraesentatione `Jacobi' quod sit bonum veri naturalis, de qua n. 3669, 3677, {1} 3829, et 
in toto capite praecedente. Quod `parere' sit agnoscere fide tum actu, est quia per partus in Verbo significantur partus spirituales, n. 1145, 1255, 3860, 3868; spiritualis partus est veri et boni 
agnitio et fides, hic agnitio fide tum actu, nempe veri interioris per `Rachelem' repraesentati; quia non prius aliquid agnoscitur fide quam tum vivitur secundum id, idcirco dicitur agnitio fide 
tum actu; vera fidei quae non addiscuntur propter agere, sed solum propter scire, illa se adjungunt affectionibus mali et falsi, quare non sunt fidei apud illum qui addidicit, sed sunt interius contra 
fidem. @1 i 3775$ </p>
