<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8864节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8864.</strong>“我是耶和华你的神”表在良善和真理的每一个方面普遍掌权的神性人身方面的主。这从以下事实清楚可知：在圣言中，“耶和华”是指主，而非其他人（参看<a href="1343.htm">1343</a>，<a href="1736.htm">1736</a>，<a href="2921.htm">2921</a>，<a href="3023.htm">3023</a>，<a href="3035.htm">3035</a>，<a href="3448.htm">3448</a>，<a href="5663.htm">5663</a>，<a href="6280.htm">6280</a>，<a href="6281.htm">6281</a>，<a href="6303.htm">6303</a>，<a href="8274.htm">8274</a>节），“万军之耶和华”、“主耶和华”和“耶和华神”同样是指主（<a href="2921.htm">2921</a>，<a href="3023.htm">3023</a>，<a href="3448.htm">3448</a>，<a href="6303.htm">6303</a>节）；主凭神性良善，也就是神性存在被称为“耶和华”，凭神性真理，也就是神性显现被称为“神”（<a href="6905.htm">6905</a>，<a href="709.htm">709</a>，<a href="732.htm">732</a>，<a href="1096.htm">1096</a>，<a href="2586.htm">2586</a>，<a href="2769.htm">2769</a>，<a href="2807.htm">2807</a>，<a href="2822.htm">2822</a>，<a href="3921.htm">3921</a>e，<a href="4402.htm">4402</a>节）。“耶和华神”在此之所以表示主的神性人身，是因为在圣言中，“耶和华”和“神”都表示这神性人身方面的主：“耶和华”表示神性良善，祂在人身方面甚至也是神性良善；“神”表示神性真理，祂是神性真理，因为神性真理是从祂发出的。<br />“耶和华神”之所以表示主的神性人身，是因为在主里面的神性本身在天上是看不见的，甚至感知不到，因而无法以信和爱来接受；只有神性人身可以。神性本身无法被传给天上的天使，更无法传给世人，除非通过神性人身，这一点凭主在福音中所说的话而在教会是众所周知的；在福音书中，主说：祂是门；祂是中保；若不藉着祂，没有人能到父那里去；除了祂之外，没有人认识父；没有人看见过父，甚至见过祂所取的任何形状。由此明显可知，“耶和华神”在此所表示的，正是主。祂还是救赎人类，并把他们从地狱释放出来的那一位，这也是众所周知的。接下来的话，即：“我曾将你从埃及地为奴之家领出来”。由此明显可知，从西乃山上说话的耶和华是指神性人身方面的主。<br />这句话是主从西乃山上所说的第一个真理，因为它必在接下来的每一个和一切真理中普遍掌权。事实上，先说的话必被人牢记在心，并且必被视为普遍存在于接下来的一切话中的东西。下面会看到“普遍掌权”是什么意思。主说的真理都具有这种性质，即：先说的真理必在接下来所说的真理中掌权，并将它们包括在内；这些真理反过来必在之后的真理中掌权，并它们包括在内，依此类推。在本章，接下来所说的真理就是十诫，也就是内在真理，之后是律例，也就是外在真理。前者和后者必有主（祂的神性人身）在它们里面掌权，因为它们源于祂自己，就是祂自己。事实上，可以肯定的是，凡系从祂发出的真理的真理，以及从祂发出的事物都是祂自己。主的神性人身必在信的每一个部分中掌权，这在诸教会也是众所周知的；因为它们教导没有主，就没有救恩，一切信之真理和良善皆来自主。因此，祂既是信的源头，也就是与人同在的信；祂若是信，也是包含在来自圣言的信之教义中的一切真理。这也是主被称为“圣言”的原因。<br />先到来的真理必在接下来到来的事物中掌权，依次类推，如前所述；这一事实从主所说的一切话，尤其从祂的祷告，也就是“主祷文”明显看出来。在这个主祷文中，一切事物以这样的系列接踵而来，它们可以说构成一个从上到下逐渐变大的柱，并含有这个系列中的在先事物在自己里面。先在其中的事物是最内在的，然后依次到来的事物则逐渐添加到最内层，以这种方式逐渐变宽。最内在的事物在一切周围部分中掌权；它普遍掌权，也就是在一切细节中掌权，因为它对它们的存在都是至关重要的。</p>

I am Jehovah thy God. That this signifies the Lord as to the Divine Human universally reigning in each and all things of good and truth, is evident from the fact that in the Word no other than the Lord 
is meant by "Jehovah" (see n. 1343, 1736, 2921, 3023, 3035, 3448, 5663, 6280, 6281, 6303, 8274), in like manner by "Jehovah Zebaoth," by "the Lord Jehovih," by "Jehovah God" (n. 2921, 3023, 3448, 6303); 
and that the Lord is called "Jehovah" from the Divine good, which is the Divine Being, but "God" from the Divine truth, which is the Divine Coming-forth (n. 6905, also n. 709, 732, 1096, 2586, 2769, 
2807, 2822, 3921, 4402). That it is the Divine Human of the Lord which is here meant by "Jehovah God," is because the Lord as to this is meant in the Word both by "Jehovah" and by "God"-the Divine 
good, which He is even as to the Human, by "Jehovah;" and the Divine truth, which He is because it proceeds from Him, by "God." [2] That the Divine Human of the Lord is meant by "Jehovah God," is because 
the Divine Itself which is in the Lord cannot be seen in heaven, and not even perceived, thus cannot be received in faith and love, but the Divine Human only. That the Divine Itself cannot be communicated 
to the angels in heaven, and still less to men on earth, except through the Divine Human, is known in the churches from the words of the Lord in the Evangelists, where He says that He is the 
"door," that He is the "mediator," that "no one can come to the Father but through Him," that "no one knoweth the Father but He," and that "no one hath seen the Father," not even any "shape" of Him. 
From this it is plain that it is the Lord who is here meant by "Jehovah God." That it is He also who redeemed the human race and liberated it from hell is likewise known. This is signified by the words 
which follow: "who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of servants." From all this it is now plain that Jehovah God who spoke from Mount Sinai denotes the Lord as to the 
Divine Human. [3] That this is the first thing which is said by the Lord from Mount Sinai, is because this ought to reign universally in each and all things that follow; for what is said first must be 
kept in the memory in the things that follow, and must be regarded as the universal thing that is in them. What is meant by "universally reigning" shall be seen in what follows. The things said by the 
Lord are all of this nature, namely, that the things said first are to reign in the things which follow, and are to involve them, and so successively the things that follow in the series. The things 
which follow in this chapter are the commandments of the Decalogue, which are internal truths, and then the statutes, which are external truths. In both of these the Lord must reign as to the Divine 
Human, for they are from Him, and are Himself, because all truths that are truths proceed from Him, and the things which proceed from Him are Himself. That the Lord as to the Divine Human must reign 
in each and all things of faith, is also known in the churches, for it is there taught that without the Lord there is no salvation, and that all the truth and good of faith are from Him. Thus as He is 
the source of faith, He is the faith with man, and if the faith, He is also every truth that is contained in the doctrine of faith, which is from the Word. From this also it is that the Lord is called 
"the Word." [4] That the things which precede must reign in the things which follow, and thus in the series, as said above, is evident from everything which the Lord spoke, especially from His prayer, 
which is called "the Lord's Prayer." In this prayer all things follow on in such a series that they constitute as it were a column that grows larger from top to bottom, in the interiors of which are 
the things which precede in the series. What is first therein is inmost, and what succeeds in order adds itself to the inmost successively and thus grows. That which is inmost reigns universally in 
those things which are round about; that is, in each and all things; for from this is that which is essential to the existence of all things. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8864</b></p><p><b>8864.</b>
'I am Jehovah your God' means the Lord in respect of the Divine Human reigning universally, in every single aspect of goodness and truth. This is clear from the consideration that in the Word no one 
other than the Lord is meant by 'Jehovah', <a href="1343.htm">1343</a>, <a href="1736.htm">1736</a>, <a href="2921.htm">2921</a>, <a href="3023.htm">3023</a>, <a href="3035.htm">3035</a>, <a href="3448.htm">3448</a>, <a href="5663.htm">5663</a>, <a href="6280.htm">6280</a>, <a href="6281.htm">6281</a>, <a href="6303.htm">6303</a>, <a href="8274.htm">8274</a>, or likewise by 'Jehovah Zebaoth', 'the Lord Jehovih', and 'Jehovah God', <a href="2921.htm">2921</a>, <a href="3023.htm">3023</a>, <a href="3448.htm">3448</a>, <a href="6303.htm">6303</a>; and from the consideration that the Lord is called 'Jehovah' by virtue of the Divine Good, which is the Divine Being (Esse), and 'God' by virtue of Divine Truth, which is the Divine Coming-into-being 
(Existere), <a href="6905.htm">6905</a>, and also <a href="709.htm">709</a> <a href="732.htm">732</a>, <a href="1096.htm">1096</a>, <a href="2586.htm">2586</a>, <a href="2769.htm">2769</a>, <a href="2807.htm">2807</a>, <a href="2822.htm">2822</a>, <a href="3921.htm">3921</a> (end), <a href="4402.htm">4402</a>. The reason why the Lord's Divine Human is what 'Jehovah God' is used to mean here is that the Lord in respect 
of that Divine Human is meant in the Word both by 'Jehovah' and by 'God'. Divine Good, which He is also in respect of the Human is meant by 'Jehovah', while Divine Truth, which He is because it goes forth 
from Him, is meant by 'God'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why the Lord's Divine Human is meant by 'Jehovah God' is that the Divine Itself which is within the Lord cannot be seen in heaven or even perceived, 
thus cannot be received in faith and love; only the Divine Human can. The truth that the Divine Itself cannot be communicated to angels in heaven, skill less to people on earth, except through the Divine 
Human is well known in the Churches from the Lord's words in the Gospels, where He says that He is the Door; that He is the Mediator; that nobody can come to the Father except through Him; that no 
one except Himself knows the Father; and that no one has seen the Father, not even some shape He might take. From all this it is evident that it is the Lord who is meant here by 'Jehovah God'. It is 
also well known that He is also the one who has redeemed the human race and delivered them from hell. This truth is meant by the words that follow, by 'I brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of 
the house of slaves'. From all this it is now evident that Jehovah God, who spoke from Mount Sinai, is the Lord in respect of the Divine Human. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The reason why this is the first truth to be stated 
by the Lord from Mount Sinai is that it must be present, reigning universally in each and every truth that follows. For what is stated first must be held in mind and must be seen to reside universally 
in everything that follows. What 'universally reigning' describes will be seen below. The truths which were stated by the Lord are all of this nature. That is to say, truths stated first must reign 
in those stated next and incorporate them; these in turn must reign in and incorporate those after that, and so on sequentially. In the present chapter the truths stated next are the Ten Commandments, 
which are inward truths, and after these the statutes, which are outward truths. The latter and the former must have the Lord - His Divine Human - reigning within them, for they spring from Himself, 
and are Himself. For, to be sure, truths which are truths all emanate from Him; and the things which emanate from Him are Himself. The truth that the Lord's Divine Human is what must reign in every 
single part of faith is also well known in the Churches; for they teach that there is no salvation without the Lord, and that all the truth and good of faith comes from Him. Thus since He is the source 
of faith He is the faith present with a person; and if He is the faith He is also all the truth contained in teachings about faith that are drawn from the Word. This also is the reason why the Lord 
is called 'the Word'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The truth that what comes first must reign in what comes next, and so on sequentially, as stated above, is clear from the individual parts of the things spoken by the Lord, 
in particular from His prayer called the Lord's Prayer All its parts follow one another in such a sequence that they constitute a pillar so to speak, widening from the top down to the base and holding 
inside itself the things that appear earlier in the sequence. What is first there is inmost, and what comes after in sequence adds itself gradually to the inmost and in that way grows wider. What 
is inmost then reigns in all the surrounding parts; it reigns universally, that is, in every detail, for it is essential to the existence of them all. </p>

`Ego Jehovah Deus tuus': quod significet Dominum quoad Divinum Humanum universaliter regnans in omnibus et singulis boni et veri, constat ex eo quod in Verbo non alius per Jehovam intelligatur quam 
Dominus, n. 1343, 1736, 2921, 3023, 3035, 3448, 5663, 6280, (t)6281, 6303, 8274, pariter per Jehovam Zebaoth, per Dominum Jehovih, per Jehovam Deum, n. 2921, 3023, 3448, 6303; quodque Dominus (t)dicatur 
Jehovah ex Divino Bono, quod est Divinum {1} Esse, at Deus ex Divino Vero, quod est Divinum {1} Existere, n. 6905, tum n. 709, 732, 1096, 2586, 2769, 2807, 2822, 3921 fin., 4402; quod sit Divinum Humanum 
Domini, quod hic per `Jehovam Deum' intelligitur, est quia Dominus quoad illud in Verbo tam per `Jehovam' quam per `Deum' intelligitur, Divinum Bonum, quod Ipse est etiam quoad Humanum, per `Jehovam,' 
et Divinum Verum, quod Ipse est quia procedit ab Ipso, per `Deum.' 	[2] Quod Divinum Humanum Domini per `Jehovam Deum' intelligatur, est quia ipsum Divinum quod {2} in Domino, in caelo non potest 
videri et ne quidem percipi, ita `nec' recipi fide et amore, sed modo Divinum Humanum; quod ipsum Divinum non communicari possit cum angelis in caelo, et minus cum hominibus in terra, nisi per Divinum 
Humanum, notum est {3} in Ecclesiis ex Domini verbis (o)apud Evangelistas, ubi dicit quod Ipse sit janua, quod {4} sit mediator, quod nemo venire possit ad Patrem quam per Ipsum, quod nullus noscat 
Patrem quam Ipse, et quod nullus viderit Patrem, ne quidem aliquam speciem Ipsius; inde patet quod sit Dominus {5} Qui hic per `Jehovam Deum' intelligitur; quod etiam Ipse sit qui redemerit humanum 
genus et liberaverit ab inferno, etiam notum est; haec significantur per verba quae sequuntur, nempe per `eduxi te e terra Aegypti, e domo servorum'; ex his nunc patet quod Jehovah Deus, Qui locutus 
e monte Sinai, sit Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum. 	[3] Quod hoc primum sit quod e monte Sinai a Domino dicitur {6}, est quia hoc erit universaliter regnans in omnibus et singulis quae sequuntur, nam 
quod primum dicitur, hoc memoria tenebitur in sequentibus, et hoc spectabitur {7} ut universale quod in illis erit; quid universaliter regnans, videbitur in sequentibus; quae a Domino dicta sunt {8}, 
illa omnia sunt talia, quod nempe quae primum dicuntur, in sequentibus regnabunt, (c)ac involvent illa, ac ita successive illa quae in serie; quae (o)in hoc capite sequuntur sunt praecepta decalogi, 
quae sunt vera interna, et dein statuta, quae sunt vera externa; in his et (o)in illis regnabit Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum, nam sunt ex Ipso, et {9} sunt Ipse, quippe {10} vera quae vera sunt procedunt 
omnia ab Ipso, et quae procedunt ab Ipso sunt Ipse; quod Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum sit quod in omnibus et singulis fidei regnabit, etiam notum est in Ecclesiis, nam docetur quod absque Domino 
nulla salus, et quod omne verum et bonum fidei sit ab Ipso, ita quia Ipse est a Quo fides, est ipse fides apud hominem, et si fides, est etiam omne verum, quod doctrina fidei, quae e Verbo, continet; 
inde quoque est quod Dominus dicatur Verbum {11}. 	[4] Quod quae praecedunt regnabunt in sequentibus, et sic in serie, (o)ut supra dictum est, constat ex singulis quae Dominus locutus est, imprimis 
ex oratione Ipsius, quae Oratio Dominica vocatur; in illa omnia in tali serie consequuntur {12}, ut quasi constituant columnam a supremo ad imum crescentem, in cujus interioribus sunt quae in serie praecedunt;
