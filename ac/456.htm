<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第456节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>456.</strong>他们当中最精通者还说天堂之乐只在于赞美敬拜主，无需行出仁爱的善行，并且这才是积极的生活。然而，他们被告知，赞美敬拜主并不构成这种积极生活，而是这种生活的自然结果，因为主不需要任何赞美。他们还被告知，主盼望世人去实践仁爱的好行为，他们根据这些行为从主接受快乐。但这些精通者仍旧无法形成在仁爱行为中的喜乐的概念，只明白奴役的概念。不过，天使证实，这种生活才是绝对自由，它和难以形容的快乐连在一起。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]456.</strong> Some very well informed people claimed that heavenly joy lay in a life spent not in carrying out the good deeds prompted by charity but only in praising and celebrating the Lord. This life they called an active one. But I said that praising and celebrating the Lord is not an active life of the kind meant but a mere side effect of that life. The Lord has no need of praise but wants us to do the good things that charity calls on us to do. That is the activity that determines how happy the Lord can make us.<br />Those people, smart as they were, still could not find any promise of joy in the good deeds of charity, only the prospect of servitude. But to do such deeds is actually freeing and brings with it indescribable happiness, as the angels testified. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 456</b></p><p><b>456.</b>
The best instructed of them all said that heavenly joy consists solely in praising and glorifying the Lord, being a life destitute of any doing of the goods of charity, and that this is an active life. 
But they were told that praising and celebrating the Lord is not such an active life as is meant, but is an effect of that life; for the Lord has no need of praises, but wills that they should do the 
goods of charity, and that it is according to these that they will receive happiness from the Lord. But still these best instructed persons could form no idea of joy, but of servitude, in doing these 
goods of charity. But the angels testified that such a life is the freest of all, and that it is conjoined with happiness unutterable. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 456</b></p><p><b>456.</b>
Those who were the most well-versed have said that heavenly joy consisted in simply praising and blessing the Lord without performing good deeds of charity, and that this was an active life. They were 
told however that praising and blessing the Lord did not constitute such an active life, but was the outgrowth of that life, for the Lord has no need of any praises. They were also told that He wishes 
men to perform the good deeds of charity, and that in accordance with these they receive happiness from the Lord. But these very well-versed people were still unable to grasp any idea of joy, only 
of slavery, in the good deeds of charity. The angels testified however that such a life is absolute freedom, and that it is joined to indescribable happiness.  </p>

</p><b>456.</b>
Qui instructissimi fuerunt, gaudium caeleste consistere dixerunt in vita absque praestandis bonis charitatis, solum ut laudent et celebrent Dominum, et quod ea esset vita activa; sed dictum quod laudare 
et celebrare Dominum, non sit talis vita activa sed effectus illius vitae, nam laudibus non opus habet Dominus sed vult ut praestent bona charitatis; secundum illa accipiunt a Domino felicitatem. 
At instructissimi ii non usque potuerant habere in bonis illis charitatis aliquam ideam gaudii sed servitutis, veram quod liberrimum sit, et cum ineffabili felicitate conjunctum, testati sunt angeli. </p>
