THE INTERNAL SENSE Verse 1. And the two angels came to Sodom in the evening; and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom; and Lot saw, and rose up to meet them, and bowed himself with his face to the earth. 
"The two angels came to Sodom in the evening," signifies the visitation which precedes the Judgment; the "two angels" signify the Lord's Divine Human and Holy proceeding, to which Judgment belongs; 
"Sodom" signifies the evil, especially those within the church; "evening" is the time of visitation; "and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom," signifies those who are in the good of charity, but 
in external worship, who here are "Lot;" these are among the evil, but are separated from them, which is to "sit in the gate of Sodom;" "and Lot saw," signifies their conscience; "and rose up to meet 
them," signifies acknowledgment and a disposition of charity; "and bowed himself with his face to the earth" signifies humiliation. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE </p>
<p>Verse 1 And the two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of Sodom. And Lot saw and rose up to meet them, and bowed down with his face towards 
the ground. </p>
<p>'The two angels came to Sodom in the evening' means the visitation which takes place prior to judgement, 'the two angels' meaning the Lord's Divine Human and His Holy proceeding, to which 
judgement belongs; 'Sodom' meaning the evil, especially those inside the Church; 'evening' meaning the time when visitation takes place. 'And Lot was sitting in the gateway of Sodom' means those people 
with whom the good of charity exists but whose worship is external- people represented by 'Lot' here - who are among and yet separated from the evil, which is meant by his 'sitting in the gateway 
of Sodom'. 'And Lot saw' means their conscience. 'And he rose up to meet them' means acknowledgement, and a feeling of charity. 'And bowed down with his face towards the ground' means humiliation. </p>

illis, quod est `sedere in porta Sodomae' `et vidit Lot' significat conscientiam eorum: `et surrexit obviam illis' significat agnitionem et charitatis affectum: `et incurvavit se facies in {1} terram'
