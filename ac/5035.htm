<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5035节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5035.</strong>“约瑟的主拿住他”表来自属世层的试探。这从接下来的经文清楚可知，经上接下来提到约瑟被下在监牢里，以此在内义上描述了属世层里面的属灵良善所经历的试探。这就是“约瑟的主拿住他”这句话的含义，故也是这些话的灵义。试探分为两种，一种涉及真理，一种涉及良善。涉及真理的试探通过灵人实现，而涉及良善的试探通过魔鬼实现。在来世，灵人与魔鬼根据以下事实来区分：灵人作用于心智的理解力部分，因而作用于信的事物；而魔鬼作用于心智的意愿部分，因而作用于爱的事物。也就是说，这类灵人允许自己被看到，也通过说话来显示自己；而魔鬼却使自己隐于无形，若非因流入人的激情和欲望，就不会暴露自己。在来世，这二者保持分离，邪恶的地狱灵出现在前部，在低地之下的两边；而邪恶的地狱魔鬼则出现在后部，在低地之下后面的深处。如前所述，涉及真理的试探通过恶灵实现，涉及良善的试探通过恶魔实现。接下来的经文就论述了通过恶灵实现，因而涉及反对良善的谎言的那些试探。这些试探比通过恶魔实现的那些试探要温和，它们也在后者之前发生。</p>

And Joseph's lord took him. That this signifies temptation from the natural, is evident from what now follows, where it is told of Joseph that he was put into the prison house, by which is described 
in the internal sense the temptation of spiritual good in the natural; and because the words, "Joseph's lord took him" involve this, they also signify it. Temptations are of two kinds-as to truths, and 
as to goods. Temptations as to truths are effected by spirits, but temptations as to good are effected by genii. Spirits and genii in the other life are distinguished by the fact that spirits act into 
the intellectual part of the mind, consequently into those things which are of faith; while genii act into the will part, consequently into those things which are of love. Spirits present themselves 
to view, and also manifest themselves by speech; but genii make themselves invisible, and do not manifest themselves except by an influx into the desires and cupidities. In the other life the two are 
kept separate, evil or infernal spirits appearing in front and on both sides under the earth of the lower regions, while evil or infernal genii appear under the hinder part and behind the back deep 
down under the earth there. As already said, temptations as to truths are effected by evil spirits, and temptations as to goods by evil genii. In the following pages those temptations are treated of which 
are effected by evil spirits, and thus which are effected as to false-speaking against good. These temptations are milder than those which are effected by evil genii, and they also occur first. </p>

'And Joseph's lord took him' means temptation coming from the natural. This is clear from what follows immediately after this, for the narrative goes on to refer to the committal of Joseph to the prison-house, 
describing in the internal sense the temptation of spiritual good within the natural. This being the implication of the words 'Joseph's lord took him', it is also their spiritual meaning. There 
are two kinds of temptations - those which involve truths and those which involve forms of good. Temptations involving truths are the work of spirits, but those involving forms of good are the work 
of genii. Spirits in the next life are distinguished from genii by the fact that spirits act upon the understanding part of the mind, and so upon matters of faith, whereas genii act upon the will part 
and so upon matters of love. That is to say, such spirits allow themselves to be seen, and also reveal themselves by making utterances, but genii make themselves inconspicuous and do not reveal themselves 
except by their entry into a person's passions and desires. They also exist separated in the next life, for the evil or hellish spirits appear in front and to either side beneath the lower earth, 
whereas the evil or hellish genii are beneath and to the rear, deep down at the back underneath the lower earth. Temptations involving truths are the work, as stated, of evil spirits, but temptations 
involving forms of good are the work of evil genii. From here onwards the subject is temptations - those which are the work of evil spirits, and so ones that involve false-speaking against good. 
These temptations are milder than those which are the work of evil genii; they also arise before the latter kind do. </p>

`Et accepit dominus Josephi eum': quod significet tentationem a naturali, constat a nunc sequentibus, ibi enim agitur de Josepho quod missus in domum carceris, per quod tentatio boni spiritualis 
in naturali in sensu interno describitur; et quia illa verba, nempe `accepit dominus Josephi eum', id involvunt, etiam {1} significant.  Tentationes sunt duplicis generis, nempe quoad vera et quoad 
bona; tentationes quoad vera fiunt a spiritibus, at tentationes quoad bona fiunt a geniis; spiritus et genii in altera vita distinguuntur per id quod spiritus agant in intellectuale, proinde in illa 
quae sunt fidei, genii autem in voluntarium, proinde in illa quae sunt amoris; illi nempe spiritus se sistunt videndos, et quoque se manifestant per loquelam; genii autem se inconspicuos faciunt, 
nec se manifestant quam per influxum in desideria et cupiditates; separati etiam sunt in altera vita, mali seu infernales spiritus antrorsum et utrinque ad latera apparent sub terra inferiorum, mali 
autem seu infernales genii sub parte posteriore et post tergum profunde sub terra ibi; tentationes quoad vera fiunt, (t)ut dictum, a malis spiritibus, et {2} tentationes quoad bona fiunt a malis 
geniis; in sequentibus nunc agitur de tentationibus, sed de illis {3} quae fiunt a malis spiritibus, ita quae fiunt quoad falsiloquium contra bonum; hae tentationes mitiores sunt illis tentationibus 
quae fiunt a malis geniis; et quoque prius existunt. @1 i id$ @2 at$ @3 i hic$ </p>
