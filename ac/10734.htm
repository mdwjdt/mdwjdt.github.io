<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10734节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>星空中第五个星球<br /><strong>10734</strong>.我被带到我们太阳系之外的宇宙中的另一个星球，这一切是通过我心智的状态变化，因而我灵的变化实现的。因为如前面数次所说明的，灵从一个地方被带到另一个地方，只能通过其内层状态的变化而实现；但这些变化在他看来，就像从一个地方移动到另一个地方或旅行。在我从我的生命状态过渡到他们的生命状态，因而就灵而言，我被带到那里之前，我所经历的变化持续了大约十个小时。唯独主能以这种方式依次改变一个人的心智状态，直到它最终接近另一个距离如此遥远之人的心智状态。我被带到东边、左侧，似乎逐渐被提到水平面之上。我还被允许清楚观察到我远离原先的地方，直到最后我所离开的那些人消失不见了；与此同时，我在路上与陪同我的灵人谈论了各种话题。</p>

ON THE FIFTH EARTH IN THE STARRY HEAVEN. I was conducted to yet another earth that is in the universe beyond our solar world, which was effected by changes of the state of my mind, thus in respect to 
my spirit. For as already stated several times, a spirit is conducted from place to place no otherwise than by changes of the state of his interiors; but which changes appear to him as advancings from 
place to place, or as journeyings. These changes went on continuously for about ten hours before I came from the state of my life to the state of their life, thus before I was brought there in respect 
to my spirit. The Lord alone is able successively to change the state of mind in this way, so that at last it approaches the state of another person who is so far distant. I was carried toward the 
east and to the left, and I seemed to be gradually raised above the horizontal plane; and I was also allowed clearly to observe the progression and advancement from the former place, until finally those 
from whom I had departed were no longer in sight; and meanwhile as we went along I spoke about various matters to the spirits who were with me. </p>

THE FIFTH PLANET OUT IN SPACE  </p>
<p>I was conveyed to yet another planet in the universe outside our solar system, which was accomplished by means of changes in the state of my mind, thus changes as 
to my spirit. For as stated several times before, the only way in which a spirit is conveyed from one place to another is by means of changes in the state of the spirit's interiors, though these changes 
still seem to him to be like movements from place to place or journeys. The changes I experienced then went on continuously for about ten hours before I had passed from my state of life and arrived 
at their state of life, thus before I had been conveyed there as to my spirit. Such changes taking place one after another in the state of someone's mind until it approaches the state of the mind of 
another who is so far away can be accomplished only by the Lord. I was carried eastwards away to my left and seemed to be gradually lifted up above the horizontal plane. I was also given a clear view 
of my progress away from the previous place, till at length those from whom I had departed were no longer in sight; and in the meantime I talked on the way about various matters to the spirits who accompanied me.  </p>

</p><b>10734.</b>
Perductus sum adhuc ad aliam tellurem quae in universo extra mundum nostrum solarem, quod factum per mutationes status mentis meae, ita quoad spiritum, nam, ut prius (x)aliquoties dictum est, spiritus 
non aliter perducitur e loco in locum quam per mutationes status interiorum ejus, quae mutationes usque apparent ei sicut promotiones e loco in locum, seu sicut profectiones; perstabant illae mutationes 
continue per decem horas circiter antequam pervenirem a statu vitae meae ad statum vitae illorum, ita antequam quoad spiritum meum illuc perductus sum; mutare sic statum mentis successive usque 
ut accedat ad statum alterius qui tantum distat, solus Dominus potest.  Ferebar versus orientem ad sinistrum, et videbar sensim elevari a plano horizontali; etiam observare dabatur perspicue progressionem 
et promotionem a priore loco, usque tandem ut non apparerent amplius illi a quibus discessi; ac interea cum spiritibus qui una mecum erant, de variis in via locutus sum. </p>
