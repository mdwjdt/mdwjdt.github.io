<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9043节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9043.</strong>“以致胎儿掉了出来”表如果尽管如此，它仍在属世层中被确认。这从“出来”和“胎儿”的含义清楚可知：“出来”当论及正从真理形成的良善时，是指从内在人或属灵人进入外在人或属世人，如下文所述；“胎儿”是指从真理发展出来、在记忆和觉知中被承认，因而被确认的良善。因为“生育后代”在灵义上表示在信仰和行为上承认（<a href="3905.htm">3905</a>，<a href="3915.htm">3915</a>，<a href="3919.htm">3919</a>，<a href="6585.htm">6585</a>节）。此中情形是这样：一个重新成孕，可以说被带入子宫，也就是正在重生的人，首先从教会的教义，或从圣言学习信与仁的事物。这时，他把这些事物储存在属于外在人或属世人的记忆中的记忆知识当中。它们从那里被召唤到内在人中，并被储存在属于内在人的记忆中。至于人所拥有的这两种记忆，可参看前文（<a href="2469.htm">2469</a>-<a href="2494.htm">2494</a>节）。这就是与人同在的属灵生命的开始，不过，这个人还没有重生。为使他重生，他的外在人或属世人必须服从，由此必须与他的内在人保持一致。一个人只有等到他的外在人或属世人也重生之后才能重生（参看<a href="8742.htm">8742</a>-<a href="8747.htm">8747</a>节）；外在人通过内在人被主重生（<a href="3286.htm">3286</a>，<a href="3321.htm">3321</a>，<a href="3493.htm">3493</a>，<a href="4588.htm">4588</a>，<a href="5651.htm">5651</a>，<a href="6299.htm">6299</a>，<a href="8746.htm">8746</a>节）；以及当他的属世人重生时，整个人就重生了（<a href="7442.htm">7442</a>，<a href="7443.htm">7443</a>节）。<br />鉴于在圣言中，重生的各个方面通过世人从父母产生或出生的各个阶段来表述，故从上面所描述的重生过程可以看出“怀孕”、“被带入子宫”、“出胎”（即从子宫出来）和“胎儿”在灵义上表示什么，或当如何理解。也就是说，“出胎”表示从内在人进入外在人或属世人；“胎儿”表示属灵的良善，也就是由信之真理所形成的仁之良善，该良善从内在人出来进入外在人或属世人。当良善在属世人中时，此人就是一个新人；现在良善构成他的生命，从良善发出的真理构成他的外在形式。他就像一位天使，因为良善构成天使的生命，真理则构成他的外在形式，也就是人的形式。不过，这一点对属世人来说，是一个悖论，毫无意义。</p>

And her births go forth. That this signifies if nevertheless it is confirmed in the natural, is evident from the signification of "going forth," when said of the formation of good from truths, as being 
to go from the internal or spiritual man into the external or natural (of which below); and from the signification of "births," as being goods from truths acknowledged in memory and perception, and 
thus confirmed; for in the spiritual sense by "bringing forth" is meant to acknowledge in faith and act (n. 3905, 3915, 3919, 6585). The case herein is that the man who is conceived anew, carried as 
it were in the womb, and born, that is, who is being regenerated, first learns from the doctrine of the church, or from the Word, the things which are of faith and charity, which he then stores up among 
the memory-knowledges that are in the memory which belongs to the external or natural man. From this they are called forth into the internal man, and are stored up in its memory (that man has two memories 
see n. 2469-2494). This is the beginning of spiritual life with the man, but he is not yet regenerated. In order to be regenerated, the external or natural man must be in compliance, and consequently 
in agreement, with his internal man. (That a man has not been regenerated until his external or natural man has also been regenerated, see n. 8742-8747; and that the external man is regenerated 
through the internal by the Lord, n. 3286, 3321, 3493, 4588, 5651, 6299, 8746; and also that the whole man has been regenerated when his natural has been regenerated, n. 7442, 7443.) Seeing then that 
the things which belong to regeneration are expressed in the Word by the things which belong to the generation or birth of man from his parents in the world, it can be seen from the process of regeneration 
above described what is meant or signified in the spiritual sense by "conception," by "gestation in the womb," and what by "going forth from the womb," and by "birth;" namely, that "going forth 
from the womb" denotes to go from the internal man into the external or natural, and that "birth" denotes spiritual good, that is, the good of charity formed from the truths of faith, going forth from 
the internal man into the external or natural man. When good is in the natural man, the man is a new man; his life is then from good, and his form is from truths derived from good; and he is like an 
angel, for the angels have their life from good, and their form from truths, which form is the human form. But to the natural man this is a paradox. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9043</b></p><p><b>9043.</b>
'And her offspring come out' means if in spite of this it is made stronger in the natural. This is clear from the meaning of 'coming out' - when it refers to good that is being formed out of truths - 
as the passing of that good from the internal or spiritual man into the external or natural man, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'offspring' as forms of good that have developed out of truths 
and then been acknowledged because they are both known and perceived and thereby been made stronger. For 'bearing offspring' in the spiritual sense means acknowledging in faith and action, <a href="3905.htm">3905</a>, <a href="3915.htm">3915</a>, <a href="3919.htm">3919</a>, <a href="6585.htm">6585</a>. The situation is that a person who is conceived anew, carried so to speak in the womb, and born - that is, who is being regenerated - first of all takes in from the teachings of the Church 
or from the Word matters of faith and charity. These are stored away at this time among items of knowledge in the memory that belongs to the external or natural man. From there they are summoned 
into the internal man and stored away in the memory belonging to the internal man. Regarding both these memories a person possesses, see <a href="2469.htm">2469</a> <a href="2494.htm">2494</a>. This is the beginning of spiritual life with a person; 
but the person is not as yet regenerate. For him to be regenerate his external or natural man must be subservient, and as a result must be in agreement with his internal man. </p>
<p>A person has not been 
regenerated until his external or natural man has also been regenerated, see <a href="8742.htm">8742</a>-<a href="8747.htm">8747</a>. </p>
<p>The external man is regenerated by the Lord by means of the internal, <a href="3286.htm">3286</a>, <a href="3321.htm">3321</a>, <a href="3493.htm">3493</a>, <a href="4588.htm">4588</a>, <a href="5651.htm">5651</a>, <a href="6299.htm">6299</a>,

 Now seeing that aspects of regeneration are expressed in the Word by the phases of a person's generation or 
birth from his parents in the world, one may recognize from the process of regeneration described above what is understood or meant in the spiritual sense by 'conception', 'being carried in the womb', 
'going out of the womb', and 'offspring'. That is to say, 'going out of the womb' means passing from the internal man into the external or natural man; and 'offspring' means spiritual good, or the good 
of charity springing from the truths of faith, that comes from the internal man and is present in the external or natural. When good is present in the natural, then the person is new. Good now constitutes 
his life, and truths emanating from good constitute his outward form He is like an angel, for good constitutes angels' life and truths their outward form, which is the human form. But this makes 
no sense to the natural man. </p>

`Et exiverint partus ejus': quod significet si usque in naturali confirmatum, constat ex significatione `exire' cum de {1}formatione boni ex veris, quod sit ab interno seu spirituali homine in externum 
seu naturalem, de qua sequitur, et ex significatione `partuum' quod sint bona ex veris scientifice et perceptibiliter agnita et sic confirmata; per `parere' enim in spirituali sensu intelligitur agnoscere 
fide et actu, n. 3905, 3915, 3919, 6585.  Cum hoc ita se habet: homo qui e novo concipitur gestatur quasi in utero et nascitur, hoc est, qui regeneratur, primum haurit ex doctrina Ecclesiae vel 
ex Verbo illa quae fidei et charitatis sunt, quae tunc reponit inter scientifica in memoria quae est externi seu naturalis hominis; inde evocantur illa in internum hominem et reponuntur in ejus memoria; 
quod binae memoriae homini sint, videatur n. (x)2469-2494; hoc initium vitae spiritualis apud hominem est, sed nondum homo est regeneratus; ut regeneratus sit, {2}erit externus seu naturalis homo 
in obsequio, et inde in concordantia cum interno suo homine; quod homo non regeneratus sit antequam externus seu naturalis ejus homo etiam regeneratus est, videatur n. 8742-8747, (c)et quod regeneretur 
externus homo per internum a Domino, n. 3286, 3321, 3493, (x)4588, 5651, 6299, 8746, quodque totus homo regeneratus sit quando ejus naturalis, n. 7442, 7443. 2 Quia nunc illa quae regenerationis 
sunt exprimuntur {3}per illa in Verbo quae sunt generationis seu nativitatis hominis a suis parentibus in mundo, ex processu regenerationis supra (x)descripto constare potest quid intelligitur aut significatur 
per `conceptionem,' per `gestationem in utero,' quid per `exire ex utero,' et per `partum' in sensu spirituali, quod nempe `exire ex utero' sit ab interno homine in externum seu naturalem, et 
quod `partus' sit bonum spirituale, hoc est, bonum charitatis ex veris fidei, ab interno homine in externo seu naturali; cum bonum {4}in naturali est, {5}tunc homo est novus, est ejus vita tunc ex bono 
et forma ex veris a bono, et est sicut angelus, nam angelis est vita ex bono et forma ex veris, quae est forma humana; sed hoc est paradoxon homini naturali'. @1 bono$ @2 d here and i after cum
