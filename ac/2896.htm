<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2896节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2896.</strong>大洪水前上古教会的圣言并非书面圣言，而是被揭示给每一个上古教会成员。因为他们是属天之人，故如同与其相伴的天使那样，具有对良善与真理的直觉。因此，他们拥有写在自己心里的圣言。关于这些事，可参看前文（<a href="597.htm">597</a>，<a href="607.htm">607</a>，<a href="895.htm">895</a>，<a href="920.htm">920</a>，<a href="1114.htm">1114</a>-<a href="1125.htm">1125</a>节）。由于他们是属天之人，与天使相伴，故对他们来说，他们所看到并且无论以哪种感觉来领悟的一切事物都是主国度中属天和属灵之物的代表物和有意义的符号。因此，他们眼中所看到的，固然是世俗和地上之物，或以某种其它感觉来领悟，但他们通过并凭借这些事物所想到的，却是属天和属灵之物。他们能以这种方式，而非其它方式与天使对话，因为存在于天使当中的事物都是属天和属灵的。当这些事物降到人那里时，它们就落入诸如与人同在于尘世的那类事物中。从创世记第一章直到这里，我们一直在说明，世上的每一个事物都代表并表示天上的某种事物。这也是代表物和有意义的符号的起源，当与天使的交流开始消失后，这些代表物和有意义的符号就被名为“以诺”的人汇集起来。这就是以下这些话所表示的（参看<a href="521.htm">521</a>节）： <br />以诺与神同行，神将他取去，他就不在了。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创5.24.htm">5:24</a>）</p>

The Word in the Most Ancient Church which was before the flood was not a written Word, but was revealed to everyone who was of that church. For they were celestial men, and therefore were in the perception 
of good and truth, as the angels are (with whom moreover they were in company), so that they had the Word written on their hearts (concerning which things see n. 597, 607, 895, 920, 1114-1125). 
As they were celestial men, and had companionship with angels, all the things which they saw and apprehended by any of the senses were to them representative and significative of the celestial and spiritual 
things which are in the Lord's kingdom; so that they indeed saw worldly and earthly things with their eyes, or apprehended them by some other sense, but from them and by means of them they thought 
of celestial and spiritual things. In this way, and in no other, were they able to speak with angels; for the things with the angels are celestial and spiritual things, and when they come down to 
man they fall into such things as are with him in the world. That each one of the things in the world represents and signifies something in the heavens, has been shown from the first chapter of Genesis 
up to this point. Thence came the representatives and significatives which, when communication with angels began to cease, were collected by those meant by "Enoch," as was signified by the words (Gen. 
5:24) "Enoch walked by himself with God, and was no more, for God took him" (see n. 521). </p>

The Word in the Most Ancient Church before the Flood was not a written Word but one revealed to each member of the Church; for they were celestial people and so, like the angels in whose company they 
lived, knew through perception that which was good and true. Thus they had the Word written on their hearts. For these matters, see <a href="597.htm">597</a>, <a href="607.htm">607</a>, <a href="895.htm">895</a>, <a href="920.htm">920</a>, <a href="1114.htm">1114</a>-<a href="1125.htm">1125</a>. Because they were celestial people and 
lived in the company of angels, everything they saw and apprehended with any of their senses was to them a representative and a meaningful sign of celestial and spiritual things within the Lord's kingdom; 
so that they did indeed see worldly and earthly things with their eyes or apprehend them with one or other of their senses; but from and through those things their thoughts were of celestial and 
spiritual things. In this and no other way they were able to talk to angels, for the things that exist among angels are celestial and spiritual, and when these come down to man they descend into such 
things as exist with man in the world. The fact that particular objects in the world represent and mean those that exist in heaven has been shown all through from Genesis <a href="1.htm">1</a> to here. Such was also the 
origin of the representatives and meaningful signs, which, when communication with angels started to fade, were gathered together by the people meant by 'Enoch'. See <a href="521.htm">521</a>, where it is shown that the 
gathering of those things is meant by the following words, </p>
<blockquote>
Enoch walked with God, and he was no more, for God took him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%205:24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 5:24</a>.

Verbum in Ecclesia Antiquissima quae fuit ante diluvium, non fuit Verbum scriptum, sed revelatum unicuivis qui ab Ecclesia; fuerunt enim homines caelestes, ita in perceptione boni et veri, sicut angeli, 
cum quibus etiam consortium habuerunt; ita Verbum habuerunt cordibus suis inscriptum; de quibus videatur, n. 597, 607, 895, 920, 1114-1125.  Illi quia caelestes fuerunt, et consortium habuerunt cum 
angelis, omnia quae videbant et aliquo sensu capiebant, illis erant repraesentativa et significativa caelestium et spiritualium quae in regno Domini; sic ut mundana et terrestria quidem oculis viderent 
aut aliquo sensu caperent, sed ex illis et per illa cogitabant de caelestibus et spiritualibus; ita non aliter, loqui potuerunt cum angelis, nam quae apud angelos, caelestia et spiritualia sunt, 
et cum ad hominem, in talia quae apud hominem in mundo sunt, cadunt; quod singula quae in mundo, repraesentent et significent illa quae in caelis, hactenus a primo capite Geneseos huc usque ostensum est. 
 Inde repraesentativa et significativa venerunt, quae quando communicatio cessare incepit cum angelis, collecta fuerunt ab illis qui per Hanochum intelliguntur, {1}quae quod significata sint per haec 
verba,           Ambulavit sibi Hanoch cum Deo, et non amplius, quia       sumpsit illum Deus, Gen. V 24, videatur n. 521. @1 i et in usum posteritatis conservata$ </p>
