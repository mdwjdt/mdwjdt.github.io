<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7621节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7621.</strong>当这鸟在我头上盘旋，仍充满生命活力时，只见一个灵人从下面上来，通过腰部到了胸部，他想从那个地方带走这只鸟。不过，由于它太漂亮了，所以我周围的灵人阻止他，不让他这么做；因为他们正目不转睛地盯着它看。这时，从下面上来的这个灵人极力说服他们相信：主与他同在，因此，他是出于主这样做的。尽管我周围的灵人大部分不信这话，因为他是从下面上来的，但他们不再阻止他带走这鸟。可就在这时，天堂流入这鸟，他握不住，马上就让这只鸟从他手中挣脱飞走了。</p>

While the bird was flying about my head, and was still in the vigor of life, there was seen a spirit rising up from beneath, through the region of the loins to that of the breast, who desired to take 
away the bird from that place. But because it was so beautiful, the spirits around me prevented him from taking it away; for they all kept their eyes upon it. Then the spirit who rose up from beneath 
strongly persuaded them that the Lord was with him, and thus that he did this from the Lord. And although most of the spirits about me did not believe this, because he rose up from beneath, they no longer 
hindered him from taking away the bird; but as heaven then flowed in, he could not retain it, but presently let it fly out of his hand at liberty. </p>

While the bird was flying around my head and still full of life a spirit appeared, who rose up from underneath, coming by way of the region of the loins into that of the breast. He wished to remove the 
bird from there. But as it was so beautiful the spirits around me prevented him from doing so; for they all had their eyes fixed on it. But that spirit who had risen up from underneath then did all 
he could to convince them that the Lord was with him, thus that the Lord inspired him in what he was doing. Although most of them did not believe this because he had risen up from underneath, nevertheless 
the spirits around me no longer prevented him from removing the bird. However, because at this time heaven was flowing into it he could not keep hold of the bird and immediately let it go free out 
of his hand. </p>

Cum avis illa volabat circum caput, et adhuc in vitae vigore erat, visus {1}est spiritus, qui ex inferiore assurgebat, per regionem lumborum {2} ad regionem pectoris, is inde volebat auferre avem illam; 
sed quia tam pulchra erat, spiritus qui circum me inhibebant, ne illam auferret, visum enim suum in illa omnes tenebant; sed spiritus ille qui ex inferiore assurrexit tunc fortiter persuasit quod 
apud illum esset Dominus, et sic quod ex Domino id ageret; hoc tametsi plerique non credebant, quia ex inferiore assurgebat, usque tamen spiritus qui circum me non amplius inhibebant, quin auferret avem; 
{3}at quia tunc influebat caelum, non potuit retinere illam, sed mox remisit e manu liberam {4}. 	@1 erat$ 	@2 i usque$ 	@3 sed$ 	@4 i, et tunc ille subsidit ad inferiora unde fuit$ </p>
