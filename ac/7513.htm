<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7513节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7513.</strong>“法老派人去，看哪，以色列的牲畜连一个都没有死”表这事被那些进行侵扰的人知道。这从“法老”的代表清楚可知，“法老”是指那些进行侵扰的人，如前所述（<a href="7498.htm">7498</a>节）。“法老派人去，发现以色列的牲畜连一个都没有死”表示这事被他们知道，这是显而易见的，也就是说，他们已经知道，信之良善和真理丝毫没有在那些属于属灵教会的人中间灭亡。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7513</b></p><p><b>7513.</b>
And Pharaoh sent, and behold there was not so much as one of the cattle of Israel dead. That this signifies that this was made known to those who infest, is evident from the representation of Pharaoh, 
as being those who infest (of which above, n. 7498). That this was made known to them, namely, that nothing of the goods and truths of faith had perished among those who were of the spiritual church, 
is plainly signified by "he sent and found that there was not anything dead of the cattle of Israel." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7513</b></p><p><b>7513.</b>
'And Pharaoh sent, and behold, not even one of the livestock of Israel had died' means that it was made known to those engaged in molestation. This is clear from the representation of 'Pharaoh' as those 
who engage in molestation, dealt with above in <a href="7498.htm">7498</a>. The fact that his sending and discovering none whatever of Israel's livestock dead meant that it was made known to them is self-evident; that is 
to say, it was made known to them that none at all of the forms of good and truth of faith had perished among those who belonged to the spiritual Church. </p>

</p><b>7513.</b>
Et misit Pharao, et ecce non mortuum de pecore Israelis usque ad unum': quod significet quod id notum factum sit illis qui infestant, constat ex repraesentatione `Pharaonis' quod sint qui infestant, 
de qua supra n. 7498; quod illis notum factum sit, nempe quod nihil de bonis et veris fidei perierit apud illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali {1}, (x)significatur per quod miserit et invenerit quod non 
quicquam mortuum sit de pecore Israelis, patet. 	@1 i sunt$ </p>
