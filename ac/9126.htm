<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9126节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9126.</strong>“并被打死”表如果在这种情况下对它造成了如此大的伤害，以致它被消灭了。这从“被打”和“死”的含义清楚可知：“被打”当论及真理或良善时，是指受伤或遭受伤害（参看<a href="9034.htm">9034</a>，<a href="9058.htm">9058</a>节）；“死”是指被消灭。此处之所以指真理或良善，是因为“贼”或“偷来的东西”表示被夺走的东西，因而表示良善和真理，正如下面第3节经文所述：“他所偷来的，无论是牛、是驴、是羊群中的一只，若确实发现在他手中仍然活着”；“牛、驴、羊群中的一只”表示良善和真理的外层和内层；它们被称为“偷来的东西”，是因为它们是在贼的手里被发现的。这同样适用于“银子”和“器皿”（22:6），因为它们也表示内层和外层真理。“贼”和“偷来的东西”具有同样的含义，因为在从人抽象出来的意义上，“贼”就是偷来的东西，也就是被夺走的真理或良善（参看刚才<a href="9125.htm">9125</a>节）。</p>

And be smitten, and he die. That this signifies if then it is so injured as to be extinguished, is evident from the signification of "being smitten," when said of truth and good, as being to be injured 
or harmed (see n. 9034, 9058); and from the signification of "dying," as being to be extinguished. Truth and good are here meant, because by a "thief," or by "theft," is signified that which has been 
taken away, thus good and truth, as also in what follows: "if finding the theft be found in his hand, from an ox, even to an ass, even to one of the flock" (verse 3); an "ox," an "ass," and "one of 
the flock" signify goods and truths exterior and interior; and they are called "theft," because found in the hand of the thief; in like manner "silver" and "vessels" (verse 6), which also denote truths 
interior and exterior. The like is signified by "thief" as by "theft," because in the sense abstracted from person, "the thief" denotes the theft; that is, the truth and good that have been taken away 
(see just above, n. 9125). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9126</b></p><p><b>9126.</b>
'And is struck, and he dies' means if in this situation harm is done to it, so great that it is wiped out. This is clear from the meaning of 'being struck', when said of truth or good, as being injured 
or suffering harm, as in <a href="9034.htm">9034</a>, <a href="9058.htm">9058</a>; and from the meaning of 'dying' as being wiped out. The reason why truth and good are meant here is that 'the thief' or 'the theft' means that which has been taken 
away, thus good and truth, as also in the words that follow in verse 4, If the theft is certainly found in his hand, whether it is ox or ass, or member of the flock, [and they are] alive ... 'Ox', 
'ass', and 'member of the flock' mean exterior and interior forms of good and truths; and they are called 'the theft' because they are in the thief's hand. The like applies to silver and vessels in verse 7, in that these as well mean interior and exterior truths. 'The thief' has the same meaning as 'the theft' because in the abstract sense, in which things are understood in abstraction from a person, 
'the thief' is the theft, that is, the truth or good that has been taken away, see immediately above in <a href="9125.htm">9125</a>.  </p>

</p><b>9126.</b>
`Et percussus, et moriatur': quod significet si tunc damno afficitur usque ut exstinguatur, constat ex significatione `percuti' cum de vero (c)et bono, quod sit laedi aut {1} damno affici, ut n. 9034, 
9058, et ex significatione `mori' quod sit exstingui.  Quod verum ac bonum hic intelligantur, est quia per `furem' seu `furtum' significatur id quod ablatum est, ita bonum ac verum, ut quoque in sequentibus: </p>
<p>	Si 
inveniendo inventum fuerit in manu illius furtum a bove usque ad asinum, usque ad pecudem, viventes. vers. 3 {2}; </p>
<p>`bos,' `asinus,' et `pecus' significant {3} bona et vera exteriora et 
interiora, (o)et vocantur `furtum' (o)quia sunt in manu furis; pariter argentum et vasa, vers. 6, quae etiam vera interiora et exteriora sunt; simile per `furem' (o)quod per `furtum' significatur, quia 
{4} `fur' in sensu abstracto a persona est furtum, hoc est, verum et bonum ablatum, videatur mox supra n. 9125. </p>
