<p><strong>[NCE]187.</strong> Then we are welcomed into a community of good spirits. This is represented by a young adult astride a horse, directing it toward hell, although the horse is unable to move a step. We are represented by a young adult because as soon as we come into eternal life we find ourselves among angels and so seem to ourselves to be in the prime of our youth. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 187</b></p><p><b>187.</b>
His being next taken into the society of good spirits is represented by a young man sitting on a horse and directing it toward hell, but the horse cannot move a step. He is represented as a youth because 
when he first enters upon eternal life he is among angels, and therefore appears to himself to be in the flower of youth. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 187</b></p><p><b>187.</b>
His being received after this into a community of good spirits is represented by a youth seated on a horse which he is pointing in the direction of hell. But the horse cannot take a single step. The 
person is represented as a youth because he is among angels the moment he enters into eternal life, and so it seems to him as though he is in the bloom of youth.  </p>

</p><b>187.</b>
Quod exciperetur dein in societatem spirituum bonorum, repraesentatum est per juvenem insidentem equo, dirigentem eum versus infernum, sed non potest equus movere passum: sicut juvenis repraesentatur, 
quia ut primum in vitam aeternam venit, est inter angelos, ita sibi quasi in flore juventutis visus. </p>
