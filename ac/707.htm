<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第707节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>707.</strong>从这里到下面第5节，细节与前一章的几乎一样，只有些微的变化。接下来的内容也是这样。若不知道圣言的内义，势必会得出这样的结论：这只是在重述同一件事。类似例子出现在圣言的其它部分，尤其是先知书中，那里用其它不同的话讲述了相同的事。有时还会再次提起并描述同一件事。如前所述，其原因在于，人的意愿和觉知这两大本能彼此完全不同，圣言对这二者的论述是分开的，这就是为何存在重复的原因。从下文清楚可知，此处的情形也是如此。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]707.</strong> The text from here to verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_707/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_5" target=_top>5</a> almost restates the contents of the last chapter, without much change. The same is true beyond verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_707/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_5" target=_top>5</a>. One who is unaware of the inner meaning of the Word necessarily believes that this is mere repetition. It happens in other passages in the Word too, especially in the prophets, where the same idea is expressed by two different phrasings and sometimes is even taken up yet again and redescribed. The reason, though, is the one given before [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_707/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_590" target=_top>590</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_707/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_683" target=_top>683</a>]: that we have two very distinct faculties called intellect and will and that the Word deals with each individually; such is the cause of the repetition.<br />What follows will make it clear that this is the situation here. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 707</b></p><p><b>707.</b>
Here, as far as the fifth verse, are found almost the same things that were said in the previous chapter, merely changed in some little measure, and it is the same in the verses that follow. One who 
is not acquainted with the internal sense of the Word cannot but think that this is merely a repetition of the same thing. Similar instances occur in other parts of the Word, especially in the Prophets, 
where the same thing is expressed in different words; and sometimes is also taken up again and described a second time. But, as before said, the reason is that there are two faculties in man which 
are most distinct from each other-the will, and the understanding-and the two are treated of in the Word distinctively. This is the reason of the repetition. That this is the case here will be evident 
from what follows. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 707</b></p><p><b>707.</b>
From here down to verse 5 the details are almost identical with those stated in the previous chapter, with only minor changes; and the same applies to what comes after that. Anyone who is not aware of 
the internal sense of the Word is bound to conclude that it is mere repetition of the same thing. Similar instances occur in other parts of the Word, especially the Prophets, where the same matter is 
expressed in other and different words. And sometimes the matter is taken up again and described once more. The reason for this, as stated already, is that the two faculties with man of will and understanding 
are totally different from each other, and that the Word deals with both separately. This is the reason why repetitions exist. That the same applies here will be clear from what follows. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 707</b>
</p><b>707.</b>
Hic usque ad versum quintum fere eadem sunt quae in capite priore dicta, aliquantum modo mutata; similiter in sequentibus; qui non novit sensum internum Verbi, nusquam aliter opinari potest quam quod 
modo repetitio sit ejusdem rei; similia occurrunt alibi in Verbo, cumprimis apud Prophetas, ubi eadem res aliis et aliis vocibus exprimitur; et quandoque etiam reassumitur et iterum describitur: sed 
causa est, ut prius dictum, quod binae facultates apud hominem sint, inter se distinctissimae, intellectus et voluntas, et quod distincte in Verbo de utroque agatur; haec causa repetitionum: quod hic 
similiter, constabit ab illis quae sequuntur. </p>
