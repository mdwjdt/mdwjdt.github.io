<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第720节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>720.</strong>“每样一对”表示相对良善而言，它们是不洁净的。这一点从数字“二”的含义清楚可知。“一对”或“二”不仅表示天堂的婚姻（当用来表示天堂的婚姻时，它是一个神圣的数字），而且还与“六”有相同的含义，也就是说，“二”之于“三”，如同劳碌的六日之于休息的第七日，或圣日。因此，在圣言中，第三日也被视为第七日，意愿几乎一样，因为主在第三日复活。所以，主的降世、得着荣耀，以及出于祂的一切，既用第三日来描述，也用第七日来描述。因此缘故，之前的两天是不神圣的，相对来说不洁净。因此，何西阿书上说：<br />来吧，我们归向耶和华！祂撕裂我们，也必医治我们；祂击打我们，也必缠裹我们；过两天祂必使我们苏醒，第三天祂必使我们兴起，我们就在祂面前得以存活。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何6.1.htm">6:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何6.2.htm">2</a>）<br />撒迦利亚书：<br />耶和华说：“这全地的人，三分之二必剪除而断气；三分之一仍必存留。我要使这三分之一经火，熬炼他们，如熬炼银子。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚13.8.htm">13:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚13.9.htm">9</a>）<br />诗篇（<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗12.6.htm">12:6</a>）上说，银子炼过七次后，是最纯净的。上述经文表明，就象“每样七对”不是指每样七对，而是指神圣之物，同样，“每样一对”不是指每样两个，而是指相对不神圣之物。所以，这里的意思不是说，不洁净的牲畜，或恶情相对洁净的牲畜，或善情来说，是极少的，相当于二比七的比率，因为人里面的邪恶比良善要多得多。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]720.</strong> The symbolism of two each as things that are relatively profane can be seen from the symbolism of the number itself.<br />Two symbolizes marriage (and when it symbolizes the heavenly marriage it is a holy number), but it also symbolizes the same thing as six. Two has the same relation to three as the six days of labor have to the seventh, holy day of rest. So in the Word the third day is interchangeable with the seventh and involves almost the same meaning. This is because of the Lord's resurrection on the third day. For the same reason, just as the seventh day speaks of the Lord's entry into the world and into his glory (and all the other times he comes as well), so also does the third day. In consequence, the two preceding days are not holy but relatively profane, as in Hosea:<br />Come, let us return to Jehovah, because he has injured us and will heal us. He has struck us and will bandage us. He will bring us to life after two days; on the third day he will raise us up and we will live before him. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_720/bible_king-james-version_hosea_6_1-2" target=_top>Hosea 6:1-2</a>)<br />In Zechariah:<br />"It will come about in all the earth," says Jehovah, "that two parts in it will be cut off, will die, and a third will be left in it. And I will lead the third part through fire, and smelt them as silver is smelted." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_720/bible_king-james-version_zechariah_13_8-9" target=_top>Zechariah 13:8-9</a>)<br />And <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_720/bible_king-james-version_psalms_12_6" target=_top>Psalms 12:6</a> says that the silver would be very pure when purified seven times.<br />Just as seven each does not mean seven each but what is holy, then, two each plainly does not mean two each but what is relatively profane. In no way does this imply that the ratio of unclean animals (or negative emotions in those people) to clean animals (or good impulses) was as low as two to seven. On the contrary, we harbor immeasurably more evil than good. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 720</b></p><p><b>720.</b>
That "pairs" signify things relatively profane, is evident from the signification of the number "two." A "pair" or "two" not only signifies marriage (and is, when predicated of the heavenly marriage, 
a holy number), but it also signifies the same as "six." That is to say, as the six days of labor are related to the seventh day of rest, or the holy day, so is the number "two" related to "three;" and 
therefore the third day in the Word is taken for the seventh, and involves almost the same, on account of the Lord's resurrection on the third day. And hence the Lord's coming into the world, and in 
glory, and every coming of the Lord, is described equally by the "seventh" and by the "third" day. For this reason the two days that precede are not holy, but relatively are profane. Thus in Hosea: </p>
<p> 
    Come and let us return unto Jehovah, for He hath wounded, and He will heal us; He hath smitten and He will bind us up. After two days He will revive us; on the third day He will raise us up, and 
we shall live before Him (Hos. 6:1-2). And in Zechariah: </p>
<p>     It shall come to pass in all the land, saith Jehovah, that two parts therein shall be cut off and die, and the third shall be left therein; 
and I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined (Zech. 13:8-9). And that silver was most pure when purified seven times appears in Psalm 12:6; from all 
of which it is plain that as "seven" does not signify seven, but things that are holy, so by "pairs" are signified not pairs, but things relatively profane; and therefore the meaning is not that the 
unclean beasts, or evil affections, in comparison with the clean beasts, or good affections, were few in the proportion of two to seven, for the evils in man are far more numerous than the goods. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 720</b></p><p><b>720.</b>
'Fairs of each' means that in relation to goods they are unholy. This becomes clear from the meaning of that number. A pair or two means not only a marriage (and when the heavenly marriage is meant it 
is a holy number); it also has the same meaning as six. That is to say, two relates to three in the same way that the six days of labour do to the seventh or holy day of rest. This is why in the Word 
'the third day' takes on the same meaning as 'the seventh', and embodies almost the same, the reason being that the Lord's resurrection took place on the third day. This also is why the Lord's Coming 
into the world and into glory, and also every coming of the Lord, is described by the third day, as well as by the seventh day. The two days which go before therefore are not holy, but in relation to 
the third are unholy, as in Hosea,  </p>
<blockquote>
Come and we will return to Jehovah, for He has wounded and will heal us; He has stricken and will bind us up; He will revive us after two days, on the third day 
He will raise us up, and we shall live before Him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%206:1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 6:1, 2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
It will be in all the land, said Jehovah, that two parts in it will be cut off and breathe their last, and a 
third will be left in it. And I will lead the third part through the fire, and I will refine them as one refines silver. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%2013:8,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 13:8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
And <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2012:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 12:6</a> 
</blockquote>
speaks of silver being purest when it has been purified 
seven times. These quotations show that just as 'sevens of each' did not mean sevens of each but things that are holy, so 'pairs of each' does not mean two of each but those which in relation 
to the holy are unholy. Accordingly the meaning is not at all that unclean beasts, or man's evil affections, in relation to clean beasts, or goods, were fewer by a ratio of two to seven; for with man 
evils far outnumber goods. </p>

</p><b>720.</b>
Quod per 'bina' significentur respective profana, ex significatione numeri istius constare potest. 'Binum vel duo' significant non solum conjugium {1}(et quando conjugium caeleste, est numerus sanctus), 
sed etiam significant idem ac sex, nempe sicut sex dies laboris se habent ad septimum quietis seu sanctum, ita duo ad tres; quare 'tertius dies' in Verbo accipitur pro 'septimo,' et fere simile involvit, 
ex causa resurrectionis Domini die tertio; inde quoque Adventus Domini in mundum et in gloriam, tum omnis adventus Domini, sicut per 'diem septimum,' etiam per 'diem tertium,' describitur; inde 
'dies bini' qui antecedunt, non sunt sancti, sed respective profani, ut apud Hosheam, Ite et revertemur ad Jehovam, quia Ille sauciavit, et sanabit nos; percussit, et obligabit nos; vivificabit nos 
post biduum, in die tertio eriget nos, et vivemus coram Ipso, vi 1, 2: </p>
<p>et apud Zachariam, Erit in omni terra, dictum Jehovae, duae partes in ea exscindentur, exspirabunt; et tertia relinquetur in 
ea; et ducam tertiam partem per ignem, et conflabo eos juxta conflare argentum, xiii 8, 9; </p>
<p>et quod argentum purissimum esset, cum purificatum septies, Ps. xii 7 [A.V. 6]. Ex quibus patet quod, sicut 
per 'septena' non significata sunt septena sed sancta, ita per 'bina' non significata sint bina sed respective profana; ita nusquam quod immundae bestiae seu malae ejus affectiones tam paucae fuerint 
respective ad mundas bestias seu bona, ut duo ad septem; cum apud hominem mala innumera sunt prae bonis.   @1 Parentheses inserted, not in I.$ </p>
