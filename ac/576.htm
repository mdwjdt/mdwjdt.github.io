<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第576节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>576.</strong>数字十和十分之一均表示余留，这一点从以下经文清楚可知：<br />必有许多又大又美的房屋成为荒凉，无人居住。十亩葡萄园只出一罢特酒；一贺梅珥谷种只结一伊法粮食。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.9.htm">5:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.10.htm">10</a>）<br />这是指属灵属天事物的荒废。“十亩葡萄园只出一罢特酒”表示属灵事物的余留极其稀少，而“一贺梅珥谷种只结一伊法粮食”则表示属天事物的余留极其稀少：<br />陆地的中央撇下的地土很多。境内剩下的人若还有十分之一，也必被吞灭；它必被连根拔起。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛6.12.htm">6:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛6.13.htm">13</a>）<br />“陆地的中央”表内在人，“十分之一”表余留的贫乏。以西结书：<br />你们要用公道天平、公道伊法、公道罢特。伊法与罢特大小要一样。罢特可盛贺梅珥十分之一，伊法也可盛贺梅珥十分之一，都以贺梅珥的大小为准。所分定的油，按油的罢特，十罢特就是一贺梅珥。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结45.10.htm">45:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结45.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结45.14.htm">14</a>）<br />此处提及的数量与耶和华的圣物有关，它们表示各种不同的圣物。这里的“十”表属天事物的余留，因而表属灵事物的余留。若它们不蕴含神圣的奥秘，那么在上述经文和论及天堂耶路撒冷、新圣殿的44章，其它先知书，以及犹太教会的各种礼仪中以数字描述这么多的量有什么用或意图呢？<br />②阿摩司书：<br />以色列的处女跌倒，不得再起。主耶和华如此说：“以色列家的城，发出一千兵的，只剩一百；发出一百的，只剩十个”。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩5.2.htm">5:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩5.3.htm">3</a>）<br />论到余留，经上说剩下的极少，只有十分之一，或余留的余留。阿摩司书：<br />我憎恶雅各的荣华，厌弃他的宫殿；我必将关闭那城和其中所有。那时，若在一房之内剩下十个人，也都必死。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩6.8.htm">6:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩6.9.htm">9</a>）<br />“十”表几乎没有存留的余留。摩西五经：<br />亚扪人和摩押人不可入耶和华的会；他们的子孙虽过十代，也永不可入耶和华的会。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申23.3.htm">23:3</a>）<br />“亚扪人和摩押人”表亵渎信的属天属灵事物，前文阐述了它们的余留。<br />③由此清楚可知，“十分之一”表示余留，对此，玛拉基书上说：<br />你们要将当纳的十分之一全然送入仓库，使我家有粮，以此试试我是否为你们敞开天上的窗户，倾福与你们。（玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛3.10.htm">3:10</a>）<br />“使我家有粮”表示内在人中好比“粮”的余留，因为它们好象被暗中植入到这么多恶与假之中，所有祝福就是通过这些余留倾入。人的所有仁爱都是通过内在人中的余留进到人里面，这一事实也体现在犹太教会的律例中：他们一旦取了十分之一，就要分给利未人和寄居的与孤儿寡妇（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申26.12.htm">26:12</a>及下面几节）。<br />④由于余留唯独属于主，所以十分之一被称为“归给耶和华为圣的”，摩西五经提到它们说：<br />地上所有的，无论是地上的种子，是树上的果子，十分之一是耶和华的，是归给耶和华为圣的。凡牛群羊群中，一切从杖下经过的，每第十只要归给耶和华为圣。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利27.30.htm">27:30</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利27.32.htm">32</a>）<br />由十条诫命或十句圣言构成的十诫，与耶和华将它们写在石版上均表余留；耶和华的手写下它们的事实表示这余留唯独属于主。石版表示它们存在于内在人中。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]576.</strong> The following places establish the fact that ten, like a tenth, symbolizes a remnant. In Isaiah:<br />Many houses will become desolate — large, beautiful ones — without any inhabitant, since ten acres of vineyard will yield a single bath, and the sowing of a homer will yield an ephah.{*1} (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_576/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_5_9-10" target=_top>Isaiah 5:9-10</a>)<br />This concerns the devastation of spiritual and heavenly qualities. "Ten acres of vineyard will yield a bath" stands for the fact that so few traces of any spiritual quality remain. "The sowing of a homer will yield an ephah" stands for the fact that so few traces of any heavenly quality remain. In the same author:<br />And a great [portion] will be abandoned in the middle of the land, but a tenth will remain there and be converted; yet they are destined for eradication. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_576/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_6_12-13" target=_top>Isaiah 6:12-13</a>)<br />The middle of the land stands for the inner self, and the tenth part, for so small a remnant. In Ezekiel:<br />You shall have honest scales and an honest ephah and an honest bath. The measure of an ephah and of a bath will be the same, so that a bath may hold a tenth of a homer, and an ephah a tenth of a homer. Their measure will be according to the homer. And the statute for the oil — the bath for oil — is a tenth of a bath out of a kor,{*2} ten baths being a homer; for ten baths are a homer. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_576/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_45_10-11" target=_top>Ezekiel 45:10-11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_576/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_45_14" target=_top>14</a>)<br />This discusses holy attributes of Jehovah in terms of measures, which symbolize different categories of sacred qualities. Ten here symbolizes a remnant of heavenly traits and of the spiritual traits that grow out of them. What would be the point of all these measures and the numbers that specify them if they did not contain some hidden, sacred significance? This applies to chapter <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_576/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_45_1-25" target=_top>45</a> of Ezekiel and earlier chapters dealing with the heavenly Jerusalem and the new temple, to other prophets as well, and to various rituals in the Jewish religion.<br />[2] In Amos:<br />The virgin of Israel has fallen; she will not rise again. This is what the Lord Jehovih has said: "The city going out as a thousand will leave a remnant of one hundred, and the one going out as a hundred will leave a remnant of ten for the house of Israel." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_576/bible_king-james-version_amos_5_2-3" target=_top>Amos 5:2-3</a>)<br />Here a remnant is mentioned, of which the smallest part will remain, since it is only a tenth part, or in other words, a remnant of a remnant. In the same author:<br />Jacob's pride and his palaces I hate, and I will shut up the city and its abundance. And it will happen that if ten men have been left in one house they will die. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_576/bible_king-james-version_amos_6_8-9" target=_top>Amos 6:8-9</a>)<br />Ten stands for the remnant, which will hardly last. In Moses:<br />Neither an Ammonite nor a Moabite will come into Jehovah's assembly; not even the tenth generation of them shall ever come into Jehovah's assembly. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_576/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_23_3" target=_top>Deuteronomy 23:3</a>)<br />The Ammonite and Moabite stand for profanation of the heavenly and spiritual attributes of faith, the remnants of which were discussed earlier [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_576/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_468" target=_top>468</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_576/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_530" target=_top>530</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_576/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_560" target=_top>560-561</a>].<br />[3] The fact that tithes represent remaining traces can be seen from the discussion above. They are treated of this way in Malachi:<br />Bring all tithes to the treasure house to be plunder in my House, and let them test me, please, in this: if I do not open to you the floodgates of heaven and pour out on you a blessing. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_576/bible_king-james-version_malachi_3_10" target=_top>Malachi 3:10</a>)<br />"To be plunder in my House" stands for the remnant in our inner self. The remnant is compared to plunder because it is tucked away among all our evils and falsities, so to speak. Through the remnant come all blessings.<br />All feeling of charity in us, too, comes by way of the remnant in our inner self. This was represented in the religion of the Jews by their giving to the Levite, the immigrant, the orphan, and the widow after they had paid their tithes (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_576/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_26_12" target=_top>Deuteronomy 26:12</a> and following verses).<br />[4] Since the remnant is the Lord's alone, tithes are described as "holy to Jehovah," as in Moses:<br />All tithes of the land — from the seed of the land, from the fruit of the tree — they will be Jehovah's, holy to Jehovah. All tithes of herd and flock, everything that passes under the [shepherd's]{*3} crook — a tithe will be holy to Jehovah. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_576/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_27_30" target=_top>Leviticus 27:30</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_576/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_27_32" target=_top>32</a>)<br />The Decalogue was the Ten Commandments, or the Ten Words,{*4} which Jehovah wrote on tablets (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_576/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_10_4" target=_top>Deuteronomy 10:4</a>), and they symbolize a remnant. The fact that they were written by Jehovah's hand symbolizes that the remnant is the Lord's alone. The fact that they reside in the inner self was represented by the tablets.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} A bath (בַּת [baṯ]) is a Hebrew liquid measure equal to about twenty-four quarts or twenty-three liters. The statement "ten acres of vineyard will yield a single bath" consequently means that ten acres will produce enough grapes to make about twenty-four quarts of wine. The Latin word here translated "acre" (jugerum) and the Hebrew word for which it stands (צֶמֶד [ṣemeḏ]) mean the amount of land a yoke of oxen could plow in a day, which, according to Lewis and Short (1879; see under jugerum) is more like two-thirds of an acre. A homer (חֹמֶר [ḥōmer]) is a dry or liquid measure equal to ten ephahs or ten baths, so "the sowing of a homer will yield an ephah" means that the harvested seed will be only a tenth of the amount sown. An ephah (אֵיפָה ['êṕā]) is a dry measure equal to about twenty-one quarts or about twenty-three liters. (See Metzger and Coogan 1993, 796.) [LHC]<br />{*2} A kor (כֹּר [kōr] in Hebrew) is the same as the liquid measure called a homer (see note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_576/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_576" target=_top>576</a>); that is, about sixty gallons or 227 liters. [LHC]<br />{*3} This bracketed interpolation is Swedenborg's. [LHC]<br />{*4} The term Decalogue comes from the Greek for "ten words;" it reflects the underlying Hebrew word דְּבָרִים (dǝḇārîm), which literally means "words." The Hebrew, however, also has the meaning "commandments," and both senses are reflected in Swedenborg's gloss here, "the Ten Commandments, or the Ten Words" (Brown, Driver, and Briggs 1996, under דָּבָר).

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 576</b></p><p><b>576.</b>
That the number "ten" and also "tenths" signify remains, is evident from the following passages of the Word: </p>
<p>     Many houses shall be a desolation, great and fair, without an inhabitant; for ten acres 
of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of a homer shall yield an ephah (Isa. 5:9-10), speaking of the vastation of things spiritual and celestial: "ten acres of vineyard making a bath" signifies 
that the remains of things spiritual were so few; and "the seed of a homer yielding an ephah" signifies that there were so few remains of things celestial. In the same: </p>
<p>     And many things are 
forsaken in the midst of the land, yet in it shall be a tenth part, and it shall return, and nevertheless it shall be consumed (Isa. 6:12-13); </p>
<p>where the "midst of the land" signifies the internal 
man; a "tenth part" signifies the smallness of the remains. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Ye shall have balances of justice, and an ephah of justice, and a bath of justice: the ephah and the bath shall be of one 
measure, the bath to contain the tenth of a homer, and an ephah the tenth of a homer; the measure thereof shall be after the homer; and the ordinance of oil, a bath of oil, the tenth of a bath out of 
a kor, ten baths to the homer, for ten baths are a homer (Ezek. 45:10-11, 14); </p>
<p>in this passage the holy things of Jehovah are treated of by measures, whereby are signified the kinds of the holy things; 
by "ten" are here signified the remains of celestial and of the derivative spiritual things; for unless such holy arcana were contained herein, what could be the use or intent of describing so many 
measures determined by numbers, as is done in this and the former chapters in the same Prophet, where the subject is the heavenly Jerusalem and the New Temple? [2] In Amos: </p>
<p>     The virgin Israel is 
fallen, she shall no more rise. Thus saith the Lord Jehovih, The city that went out a thousand shall have a hundred remaining, and that which went out a hundred, shall have ten remaining to the house 
of Israel (Amos 5:2-3), where, speaking of remains, it is said that very little would be left, being only a "tenth part" or remains of remains. Again: </p>
<p>I abhor the pride of Jacob and his palaces, and 
will shut up the city, and its fullness, and it shall come to pass if there shall be left ten men in one house they shall even die (Amos 6:8-9), speaking of remains which should scarcely remain. In 
Moses: </p>
<p>     An Ammonite or Moabite shall not come into the congregation of Jehovah, even the tenth generation of them shall not come into the congregation of Jehovah to eternity (Deut. 23:3); </p>
<p>"an 
Ammonite and a Moabite" signify the profanation of the celestial and spiritual things of faith, the "remains" of which are spoken of in what precedes.  [3] Hence it appears also that "tenths" represent 
remains. And so in Malachi: </p>
<p>     Bring ye all the tithes [tenths] into the treasure-house, that there may be booty in My house, and let them prove Me, bestir ye in this, if I will not open for you 
the cataracts of heaven, and pour you out a blessing (Mal. 3:10); </p>
<p>"that there may be booty in My house" signifies remains in the internal man, which are compared to "booty" because they are insinuated 
as by stealth among so many evils and falsities; and it is by these remains that all blessing comes. That all man's charity comes by the remains which are in the internal man, was also represented 
in the Jewish Church by this statute: that when they had made an end of tithing all the tithes, they should give to the Levite, to the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow (Deut. 26:12 seq.). 
 [4] Inasmuch as remains are of the Lord alone, therefore the tenths are called "holiness to Jehovah"; as in Moses: </p>
<p>     All the tenths of the land, of the seed of the land, of the fruit of the tree, 
they are Jehovah's, holiness to Jehovah: all the tenths of the herd and of the flock, whatsoever passeth under the (pastoral) rod, the tenth shall be holiness to Jehovah (Lev. 27:30-31). That the 
Decalogue consisted of "ten" precepts, or "ten" words, and that Jehovah wrote them on tables (Deut. 10:4), signifies remains, and their being written by the hand of Jehovah signifies that remains are 
of the Lord alone; their being in the internal man was represented by the tables. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 576</b></p><p><b>576.</b>
That the number ten means remnants, just as tenths do, becomes clear from the following places: In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Many houses will be a desolation, large and beautiful ones, without inhabitant, for ten 
acres of vineyard will yield but one bath, and a homer of seed will yield an ephah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%205:9,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 5:9, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the vastation of spiritual and celestial things. 'Ten acres of vineyard will yield but 
one bath' stands for remnants of spiritual things being so few, while 'a homer of seed will yield an ephah' stands for remnants of celestial things being so few. In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
And there 
will be many forsaken places in the midst of the land; and yet there will be a tenth part in it, and this will return; it will be however an uprooting. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%206:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 6:12, 13</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The midst of the land' stands 
for the internal man, 'a tenth part' for such a small quantity of remnants. In Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
You shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath. The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, 
the bath containing a tenth of a homer; and the ephah a tenth of a homer, the measure for it shall be after the homer. And the fixed portion of oil, of the bath of oil, shall be a tenth of a bath 
from a cor, which is ten baths to the homer; for ten baths are a homer. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2045:10,%2011,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 45:10, 11, 14</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>The quantities mentioned here relate to holy things, which are Jehovah's. They mean different kinds 
of holy things. 'Ten' here means remnants of celestial things and so of spiritual things. For what are the specific numerical quantities mentioned in this and in previous chapters of this prophet where 
the heavenly Jerusalem and the new Temple are the subject, and in other prophets, and also in the various rites of the Jewish Church, if they do not contain sacred arcana?  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In Amos,  </p>
<blockquote>
She has 
fallen, no more to rise, the virgin of Israel. Thus said the Lord Jehovah, The city that goes forth a thousand will have remnants of a hundred, and that which goes forth a hundred will have remnants 
of ten to the house of Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%205:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 5:2, 3</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>The word 'remnants' is used here, of which only a fraction will remain, for this is only a tenth part, or the remnants of remnants. In the same prophet, 
 </p>
<blockquote>
I hate the pride of Jacob and his palaces, and I will shut up the city and all that is in it. And it will be that if ten men will have remained in one house, they will die. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%206:8,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 6:8, 9</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Ten' 
stands for remnants that are not likely to remain. In Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
The Ammonite and the Moabite shall not come into the assembly of Jehovah; even the tenth generation belonging to them shall not come 
into the assembly of Jehovah forever. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2023:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 23:3</a>.   
</blockquote>
'The Ammonite and the Moabite' stands for the profanation of the celestial and the spiritual things of faith, the remnants of which have been dealt 
with already.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From this it is clear that 'tenths' represents remnants, of which Malachi speaks as follows,  </p>
<blockquote>
Bring all the tithes<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> to the treasure-house, that there may be plunder in My house, 
and let them put Me to the test in this matter whether I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing for you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mal%203:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mal 3:10</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'That there may be plunder in My house stands 
for remnants in the internal man, which are likened to 'plunder' because they are implanted, so to speak, by stealth among so many evils and falsities; and by way of such remnants comes every blessing. 
The fact that the whole of a person's charity comes to him by way of the remnants that are in the internal man was also represented in the Jewish Church by the requirement that once they had paid their 
tithes,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> they were then to give to the Levite, the stranger, the orphan, and the widow, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2026:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 26:12</a> and following verses.   </p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Since remnants are the Lord' s alone, tenths are therefore called 
'Holiness to Jehovah', and are spoken of in Moses as follows,  </p>
<blockquote>
All the tithes<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the land - of the seed of the land, of the fruit of the tree - are Jehovah's; they are Holiness to Jehovah. All tithes<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> 
of the herd and of the flock, every tenth one that passes under the (herdsman's) staff shall be Holiness to Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2027:30,%2032&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 27:30, 32</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Since the Decalogue consisted of Ten Commandments, or Ten 
Words, and Jehovah wrote them on tablets, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2010:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 10:4</a>, remnants are meant; and the fact that they were written by the hand of Jehovah means that such remnants are the Lord's alone. Their presence in the 
internal man was represented by the tablets.

<p>          'medium terrae' pro interno homine, 'decima pars' pro reliquiis tantillis: apud Ezechielem,                                              	Lances justitiae, et ephah 
justitiae, et bath justitiae erit vobis: ephae et bathi mensura una erit, ad tollendum decimum homeris bathus, et decimum homeris ephah, ad homerem erit mensura ejus,... et statutum olei bathus olei, 
decimum bathi de koro, decem bathi homer, nam decem bathi homer, xlv 	10, 11, 14; </p>
<p>              ubi de sanctis Jehovae per mensuras agitur, per quas significantur sanctorum genera; per 'decem'  hic 
reliquiae caelestium et inde spiritualium; nam quid tot mensurae determinatae numeris, ut in hoc capite et prioribus apud hunc Prophetam ubi agitur de Hierosolyma caelesti et templo novo, et apud alios, 
tum circa ritus varios Ecclesiae Judaicae, nisi arcana sancta contineant? [2] apud Amosum, 	Cecidit, non addet surgere virgo Israel:... sic dixit Dominus Jehovih, Urbs exiens mille, reliquias faciet 
centum, et exiens centum reliquias faciet decem domui Israelis, v 2, 	3; </p>
<p>         ubi 'reliquiae' nominantur quarum minimum mansurum, quia modo decima pars, seu reliquiarum reliquiae: apud eundem, 
                      Ego superbiam Jacobi, et palatia ejus odi, et concludam urbem et plenitudinem ejus; et fiet, si relicti fuerint decem viri in domo una, et morientur, vi 8, 9;                
                pro reliquiis quae vix remansurae: apud Mosen,                       	Non veniet Ammonita et Moabita in congregationem Jehovae, etiam generatio decima non veniet illis in congregationem 
Jehovae usque in aeternum, Deut. xxiii 4 [A.V. 3]; </p>
<p>                         'Ammonita et Moabita' pro profanatione caelestium et spiritualium fidei, de quorum reliquiis prius.  [3] Quod 'decimae' 
repraesentent 'reliquias,' inde constat; de quibus ita apud Malachiam, 	Adducite omnes decimas ad domum thesauri, ut sit praeda in domo Mea, et probent Me, agite, in hoc, si non aperuero vobis cataractas 
caeli, et effudero vobis benedictionem, iii 10; </p>
<p>'ut sit praeda in domo Mea' pro reliquiis in interno homine, quae comparantur 'praedae' quia quasi furtim' insinuantur inter tot mala et falsa, 
per quas reliquias omnis benedictio. Quod per reliquias quae in interno homine, omnis charitas hominis, repraesentatum quoque fuit in Ecclesia Judaica per id quod 	Postquam dederint decimas, darent 
Levitae, peregrino, orphano et viduae, Deut. xxvi 12 seq. [4]	Quia reliquiae sunt solius Domini, ideo decimae vocantur 'Sanctitas Jehovae,' de quibus ita per Mosen, 	Omnes decimae terrae, de semine 
terrae, de fructu arboris, Jehovae illae, sanctitas Jehovae.... Omnes decimae armenti et gregis, omne quod transit sub baculo (pastoritio) decimum erit sanctitas Jehovae, Lev. xxvii 30, {x}32. 'Quod 
Decalogus fuerint Decem Praecepta, seu Decem Verba, et quod Jehovah scripserit illa super tabulis,' Deut. x 4, significat 'reliquias,' et 'quod scripta manu Jehovae,' significat quod reliquiae sint solius 
Domini; quod in interno homine repraesentatum est per tabulas. </p>
