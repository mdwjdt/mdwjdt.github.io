<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8732.</strong>“他就往本地去了”表到神性本身那里。这从“往本地去”的含义清楚可知，“往本地去”是指到了以前的状态，因而到了神性那里。此外，“地”在内义上表示教会，以及天堂；故在至高意义上表示神性。“地”在内义上表示教会，因而也表示主的天国（参看<a href="566.htm">566</a>，<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>，<a href="1067.htm">1067</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>，<a href="2928.htm">2928</a>，<a href="3355.htm">3355</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="4535.htm">4535</a>，<a href="5577.htm">5577</a>，<a href="8011.htm">8011</a>节）。“地”在至高意义上之所以表示神性，是因为叶忒罗代表神性良善，因而代表神性本身，回到神性那里在文字的历史意义上只能用“往本地去”来表达。因为圣言中的灵义会使自己适应所代表的事物；然而，真正属于一个词的意义仍然存在。例如“地”的含义，正确来说，“地”表示教会，因为当在圣言中读到“地”时，天上的人不会想到土地，而是会想到在这片土地上的民族的属灵状态，因而想到那里的宗教信仰。因此，当读到教会所在的地时，他们就会想到那里的教会；除了教会，他们还会想到主的国度，进而想到天堂；除了天堂，他们还会想到那里的神性。但当所代表的事物都与教会或天堂里的某种神圣事物有关时，这个事物就会被理解为“地”，如爱、仁、良善和信。由此明显可知，这个词的正确含义仍然存在。如当表示良善或爱或仁时，它作为教会的整体意义仍然存在；因为这些事物是教会的基本特征，并使得教会成为教会。</p>

And he went to himself unto his own land. That this signifies to the Divine Itself, is evident from the signification of "going unto his own land," as being to the former state, thus to the Divine. Moreover 
by "land" in the internal sense is signified the church, and also heaven; therefore in the supreme sense is signified the Divine. (That by "land" in the internal sense is signified the church, 
thus also the kingdom of the Lord in heaven, see n. 566, 662, 1066, 1067, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 2928, 3355, 4447, 4535, 5577, 8011.) That by "land" in the supreme sense is signified the Divine, is 
because Jethro represented the Divine good, thus the Divine Itself, the returning whereto cannot otherwise be expressed in the historic sense of the letter than by "going unto his own land." For the significatives 
in the Word accommodate themselves to the thing represented, the signification which properly belongs to the expression still remaining, as for instance the signification of "land," which 
properly signifies the church, for the reason that they who are in heaven do not think of land when it is read of in the Word, but of the spiritual state of the nation which is in the land, thus of 
the religion there; and therefore when a "land" is read of where the church is, then they have an idea of the church there; and when an idea of the church, they have also an idea of the Lord's kingdom, 
consequently of heaven; and when an idea of heaven, they have also an idea of the Divine there. But when the thing represented treats of any other holy thing in the church or in heaven, then that thing 
can be understood by "land"-as love, charity, good, faith. Hence it is evident that the signification still remains which properly belongs to the expression; as when good is signified, or love or 
charity, still through all there remains the signification of the church; for these things are the essentials of the church, and make it to be the church. </p>

'And he went his way to his own land' means to the Divine Himself. This is clear from the meaning of 'going to his own land' as to the former state, that is, to the Divine. Furthermore 'land' in the 
internal sense means the Church and also heaven, so that in the highest sense it means the Divine. As regards the meaning of land' in the internal sense as the Church, and so also the Lord's kingdom in 
heaven, see <a href="566.htm">566</a>, <a href="662.htm">662</a>, <a href="1066.htm">1066</a>, <a href="1067.htm">1067</a>, <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="1850.htm">1850</a>, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>, <a href="2118.htm">2118</a>, <a href="2928.htm">2928</a>, <a href="3355.htm">3355</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="4535.htm">4535</a>, <a href="5577.htm">5577</a>, <a href="8011.htm">8011</a>. But as regards the meaning of 'land' in the highest sense as the Divine, the explanation for this is that 
'Jethro' represented Divine Good, thus the Divine Himself; and going back to the Divine cannot be expressed in the historical narrative of the literal sense in any other way than by the words, 'going 
to his own land'. For spiritual meanings in the Word adapt themselves to whatever is being represented; yet the meaning which belongs properly to a word still remains. This is so with the meaning of 
'land'. Its proper meaning is the Church, the reason for this being that those in heaven do not think of a land when 'land' is referred to in the Word; rather they think of the spiritual state of the 
nation in that land and so of religion as it exists there. When therefore a land where the Church exists is referred to they think of the Church there; along with the Church they also think of the Lord's 
kingdom, and consequently of heaven; and along with heaven they also think of the Divine there. But when the thing represented has all to do with some holy reality existing in the Church or in heaven, 
then that reality is to be understood by 'land' - such as love, charity, good, or faith. From this it is evident that the proper meaning of that word still remains. When for example good is meant, 
or love, or charity, its overall meaning as the Church still remains; for those virtues are the essential characteristics of the Church, and cause it to be the Church. </p>

`Et ivit sibi ad terram suam': quod significet ad ipsum Divinum, constat ex significatione `ire ad terram suam' quod sit ad statum priorem, ita ad Divinum; praeterea per `terram' significatur in sensu 
interno Ecclesia, et quoque caelum, inde in sensu supremo significatur Divinum; quod per `terram' in sensu interno significetur Ecclesia, {1}ita quoque regnum Domini in caelo, videatur n. 566, 662, 
1066, 1067, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 2928, 3355, 4447, 4535, 5577, 8011; quod per `terram' in sensu supremo significetur Divinum, est quia `Jethro' repraesentabat Divinum Bonum, ita ipsum Divinum, ad 
quod redire, in sensu litterae historico, non aliter quam per `ire ad terram suam' exprimi potest; nam significativa in Verbo ad rem repraesentatam accommodate se habent, remanente tamen usque significatione 
quae proprie voci competit; sicut significatio `terrae,' quae proprie significat Ecclesiam, ex causa quia illi qui in caelo sunt non cogitant de terra cum illa in Verbo legitur, sed de statu spirituali 
gentis quae in terra, ita de religioso ibi, {2}quare cum legitur terra ubi est Ecclesia, tunc ideam Ecclesiae ibi habent, et cum ideam Ecclesiae, etiam ideam regni Domini, proinde caeli {3}, 
et cum caeli, etiam Divini ibi; at cum res repraesentata agit de {4}aliqua re sancta in Ecclesia, aut in caelo, tunc {5}illa res per terram potest intelligi, sicut amor, charitas, bonum, fides; inde 
patet quod usque significatio quae proprie voci competit remaneat, sicut cum significatur bonum, vel amor vel charitas, {6} usque universaliter {7}manet significatio Ecclesiae, nam {8}illa sunt essentialia 
Ecclesiae, et faciunt ut sit Ecclesia. 	@1 et Regnum Domini seu coelum$ 	@2 et cum nominatur terra ubi est Ecclesia, tunc ideam habent Ecclesiae$ 	@3 i habent$ 	@4 reliqua IT$ 	@5 per terram
