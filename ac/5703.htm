<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5703节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5703.</strong>“他们坐在约瑟面前”表他们按次序排列，这取决于他的在场。这从“坐”和“在约瑟面前”的含义清楚可知：“坐”是指按次序排列，因为他们被约瑟按次序安置，这从接下来的经文明显看出来，即：他们因头生的照着长子的名分，最小的照着他的年幼就坐而惊奇不已；“在约瑟面前”是指这取决于他的在场。<br />此中情形是这样：就至高意义而言，“约瑟”代表主，“以色列的儿子”代表属世层中的良善与真理。当主在场时，正是祂的在场将一切事物安排得井然有序。主就是次序本身；因此，祂在那里，哪里就有次序，哪里有次序，祂就在哪里。接下来的经文描述了这种次序本身，这个次序的目的就是要看到真理在良善之下按次序正确排列。</p>

And they sat before him. That this signifies that they were set in order by his presence, is evident from the signification of "sitting," as here being to be set in order, for they were placed in order 
by Joseph, as appears from what follows (for they were amazed that the firstborn should sit according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth); and from the signification of "before 
him," as being by his presence. The case herein is this. In the supreme sense by Joseph is represented the Lord, and by Israel's sons, the goods and truths in the natural; when the Lord is present, 
then all things are set in order by His very presence. The Lord is order itself; and therefore where He is present there is order, and where there is order He is present. The order itself is described 
in the pages that now follow, which is that truths be rightly set in order under good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5703</b></p><p><b>5703.</b>
'And they took their seats in front of him' means that they were ranged in order, as determined by his presence. This is clear from the meaning of 'taking one's seat' here as being ranged in order, for 
they were placed in order by Joseph, as is evident from what immediately follows - they were astonished that the firstborn took his seat according to his birthright, while the youngest took his according 
to his youth; and from the meaning of 'in front of him' as determined by his presence. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The truth of the matter is that in the highest sense 'Joseph' represents the Lord, 'the sons of Israel' 
the forms of good and the truths in the natural. When the Lord is present His very presence arranges everything into order. The Lord is order itself, and therefore wherever He is present order exists, 
and wherever order exists He is present. That order is described in what follows next, the aim of that order being to see that truths are properly arranged beneath good. </p>

`Et {1}consederunt coram eo':  quod significet quod disponerentur a sua praesentia, constat ex significatione `consedere' quod hic sit disponi; ordinabantur enim {2}a Josepho, ut patet a mox sequentibus, 
nam obstupuerunt quod consederet primogenitus secundum primogenituram suam et minorennis secundum minorennitatem suam; et a significatione `coram eo' quod sit a sua praesentia. [2]Cum hoc ita se 
habet:  per `Josephum' in supremo sensu repraesentatur Dominus, per `filios Israelis' (t)bona et vera in naturali; cum Dominus praesens est, tunc ab ipsa praesentia Ipsius disponuntur omnia in ordinem; 
Dominus est ipse ordo, quapropter {3}ubi est praesens ibi est ordo, et ubi est ordo ibi est praesens; ipse ordo describitur in nunc sequentibus, {4}qui est ut vera rite disponantur sub bono. @1 see 
p. 263, ft. 1$ @2 ab illo, nempe$ @3 non potest alicubi praesens esse, nisi ubi est ordo, aut nisi disponat in ordinem;$ @4 nempe quod primogenitus sederet secundum primogenituram suam et minorennis 
secundum minorennitatem suam, per quae significatur quod disponerentur secundum ordinem verorum$ </p>
