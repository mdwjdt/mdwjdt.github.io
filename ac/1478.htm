And it happened when Abram came into Egypt that the Egyptians saw the woman, that she was very beautiful.<br />It happened when Abram came into Egypt means when the Lord began to be taught. That the Egyptians saw the woman, that she was very beautiful, means that by its very nature the study of religious knowledge is pleasing for its own sake. </p>

Verse 14. And it came to pass when Abram was come into Egypt, that the Egyptians saw the woman, that she was very beautiful. "It came to pass when Abram was come into Egypt," signifies when the Lord 
began to be instructed; "and the Egyptians saw the woman, that she was very beautiful," signifies that the memory-knowledge of knowledges is of such a nature as to be highly pleasing to itself. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1478</b></p><p><b>1478.</b>
Verse 14 And it happened, when Abram came into Egypt, that the Egyptians saw the woman, that she was very beautiful. </p>
<p>'It happened, when Abram came into Egypt' means when the Lord started to receive 
instruction 'That the Egyptians saw the woman, that she was very beautiful' means that the knowledge which is comprised of cognitions is by nature such as to be to itself highly pleasing. </p>

</p><b>1478.</b>
Vers. 14.  Et factum, cum venit Abram in Aegyptum, et viderunt Aegyptii feminam, quod pulchra illa valde. 'Factum, cum venit Abram in Aegyptum' significat cum inciperet Dominus instrui: 'et viderunt 
Aegyptii feminam quod pulchra illa valde' significat scientiam cognitionum quod talis sit ut sibi perplaceat. </p>
