<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4028.</strong>创世记30:41，42.每到先聚集起来的羊群发热配合的时候，雅各就在羊群眼前把枝子插在水沟里，使它们对着枝子发热配合。只是在后聚集起来的羊群眼前不插枝子。这样，后聚集起来的就归拉班，先聚集起来的就归雅各。<br />“每到先聚集起来的羊群发热配合的时候”表自发的事物。“雅各就在羊群眼前把枝子插在水沟里，使它们对着枝子发热配合”表凭祂自己的能力被召唤并联结的事物。“只是在后聚集起来的羊群眼前不插枝子”表强迫的事物。“这样，后聚集起来的就归拉班”表这些事物被留下。“先聚集起来的就归雅各”表自发的事物，或那些出于自由的事物被联结起来。</p>

Verses 41, 42. And it came to pass in every growing warm of the flock of those that came together first, that Jacob put the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that it might grow warm at 
the rods. And to the flock that came together later he did not set them; and those that came together later were Laban's, and those that came together first were Jacob's. "And it came to pass in every 
growing warm of the flock of those that came together first," signifies the things that were spontaneous; "that Jacob put the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that it might grow warm 
at the rods," signifies things called forth and conjoined by His own power; "and to the flock that came together later he did not set them," signifies things that are compulsory; "and those that came 
together later were Laban's," signifies that these things were left behind; "and those that came together first were Jacob's," signifies that the spontaneous things, or those which were from his freedom, 
were conjoined. </p>

Verses 41, 42 And so it was, whenever those came on heat - those of the flock which came together first - that Jacob put the rods before the eyes of the flock in the runners, so that they could come 
on heat at the rods. And before [the eyes of those of] the flock which came together later he did not put [the rods] in. And those which came together later were Laban's, and those which came together 
first were Jacob's. </p>
<p>'So it was, whenever those came on heat - those of the flock which came together first' means the things that were spontaneous. 'That Jacob put the rods before the eyes of the 
flock in the runners, so that they would come on heat at the rods' means summoned and joined together by His own power. 'And before [the eyes of those of] the flock which came together later he did not 
put [the rods] in' means things that are compulsory. 'Those which came together later were Laban's' means that these things were left behind. 'And those which came together first were Jacob's' means 
that the spontaneous things - or those which were from his freedom - were joined together. </p>

Vers. 41, 42.  Et fuit in omni incalescere gregis primum coeuntium, et posuit Jacob baculos ad oculos gregis in canaliculis, ad incalescendum illum ad baculos.  Et ad dein coire gregem non posuit: 
et erat dein coeuntium Labani, et primum coeuntium Jacobo. `Fuit in omni incalescere gregis primum coeuntium' significat illa quae spontanea essent: `et posuit Jacob baculos ad oculos gregis in canaliculis 
ad incalescendum illum ad baculos' significat ex propria potentia evocata et conjuncta: `et ad dein coire gregem non posuit' significat coacta: `et erat dein coeuntium Labani' significat 
quod illa relinquerentur: `et primum coeuntium Jacobo' significat quod spontanea seu quae ex libero suo conjungerentur. </p>
