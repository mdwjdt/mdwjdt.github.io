<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6628节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6628.</strong>前面各处的解释已经说明，仁之教义是古代众教会的教义，该教义将所有教会都联结起来，从而使众多教会成为一个教会。因为他们将所有过着良善和仁爱生活的人都视为教会成员，并称其为弟兄，无论他们在如今被称为信之真理的真理方面有何等大的差别。人们彼此教导这些真理，这是他们的仁爱行为之一。如果一个人不赞同另一个人的观点，他们也不会愤慨；他们知道，每个人都是照着他处于良善的程度而领受真理。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6628</b></p><p><b>6628.</b>
In the preceding Explications it has been shown, as occasion offered, that the Doctrine of Charity was the doctrine in the Ancient Churches, and that this doctrine conjoined all the churches, and so 
made one out of many; for they acknowledged as men of the church all who lived in the good of charity, and called them brethren, however greatly they might be at variance in the truths which at this day 
are called the truths of faith. In these one instructed another, and this was among their works of charity; nor were they indignant if one did not accede to the opinion of another, knowing that everyone 
receives truth in proportion as he is in good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6628</b></p><p><b>6628.</b>
It has been shown in various places in the explanations given already that teachings about charity were the teachings in the Ancient Churches, and that these teachings linked all the Churches together 
and in so doing made one Church out of many. For they recognized as members of the Church all those people who led a good and charitable life, and they called them their brothers, no matter how much 
otherwise they differed from them in truths, which at the present day are called matters of faith. People informed one another about those truths, and this was one of their charitable works. Neither 
were they annoyed if one person did not go along with the opinion of another; they knew that everyone accepts the truth insofar as he is governed by good. </p>

</p><b>6628.</b>
In explicationibus quae praecedunt, passim ostensum est quod doctrina charitatis fuerit doctrina in Antiquis Ecclesiis, et quod illa doctrina conjunxerit omnes Ecclesias ac ita ex pluribus unam fecerit; 
pro hominibus enim Ecclesiae agnoscebant omnes illos qui in bono charitatis vixerunt, et vocabant fratres, utcumque praeterea in veris, quae hodie fidei vocantur, discreparent; in his unus alterum 
{1}instruebat quod erat inter opera eorum charitatis, et quoque non indignabantur si unus ad {2}alterius sententiam non accederet, scientes quod quisque tantum veri recipiat quantum in bono est. @1 
Before unus$ @2 d alterum i illius sententiam$ </p>
