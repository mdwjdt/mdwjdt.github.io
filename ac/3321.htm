<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3321节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3321.</strong>“我累昏了”表争战的状态。这从“累昏”或“疲惫”的含义清楚可知，“累昏”或“疲惫”是指争战的状态（参看<a href="3318.htm">3318</a>节）。此处再次提及累昏了，是为了确认良善与真理在属世人里面是通过属灵的争战，也就是试探实现的。至于良善与真理在属世人里面的联结，大体情况是这样：人的理性人先于其属世人接受真理，原因在于，主的生命，也就是如前所述，属于祂的爱之生命，可通过理性人流入属世人，并给属世人带来秩序，使它变得顺从。因为理性人更纯粹，而属世人更粗糙；或也可说，前者是内层，后者是外层。根据人有可能知道的秩序，内层或更纯粹的东西能流入外层或更粗糙的东西，或也可说，理性人能流入属世人，但反过来不行。<br />因此，人的理性人能适应真理并先于其属世人接受它们。这一点从以下事实明显看出来：对于要重生的人来说，理性人与属世人大大争战，或也可说，内在人与外在人大大争战。因为如众所周知的，内在人能看见真理，还能意愿它们；而外在人则拒绝看见并反对它们。因为属世人里面的记忆知识很大程度上源于感官幻觉，尽管它们都是假的，但他却信以为真。还有无数事物是属世人所不能理解的，因为相对于理性人，属世人处在阴影和浓密的黑暗中；对于所不理解的那些事，属世人要么认为不存在，要么认为不是这样。属世人里面还有属对自我和这个世界之爱的欲望，并且他将支持这些欲望的一切事物视为真理。当人屈服于它们时，由它们所产生的一切事物就都违背属灵真理。属世人里面同样有源于虚假的推理，这些虚假打小就被印刻上了。更重要的是，人在摆脱肉体之前，通过感官清楚理解存在于其属世人中的事物，却不怎么清楚理解存在于其理性人中的事物。这也致使他以为身体就是一切，也就是说，属世人就是全部；凡不在属世感官范围内的东西，他认为几乎什么也不是。<br />这些以及许多其它因素导致属世人接受真理时要比理性人更迟、更困难。所以才会有争战产生，而且争战会持续相当长的时间，在如前所示（<a href="3318.htm">3318</a>节），属世人中接受良善的器皿通过试探被软化之前，是不会停止的；因为真理无非是接受良善的器皿（<a href="1496.htm">1496</a>，<a href="1832.htm">1832</a>，<a href="1900.htm">1900</a>，<a href="2063.htm">2063</a>，<a href="2261.htm">2261</a>，<a href="2269.htm">2269</a>节），这些器皿随着人日益执着于上述事物而越发坚硬。若此人要重生，那么他越执着，争战或冲突就越严重。由于属世人的情形就是这样，即真理与良善在其中的联结通过试探的争战实现，故此处重复提到“我累昏了”。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3321</b></p><p><b>3321.</b>
For I am weary. That this signifies a state of combat, is evident from the signification of "weary," or of "weariness," as being a state of combat (see n. 3318). Mention is here again made of being weary, 
for the sake of confirmation that the conjunction of good with truth in the natural is effected by spiritual combats, that is, by temptations. In regard to the conjunction of good with truth in 
the natural, the case in general is this: Man's rational receives truths before his natural; and this to the end that the Lord's life, which as before said is of love, may flow in through the rational 
into the natural, and dispose the natural, and reduce it to obedience. For the rational is purer, and the natural grosser; or what is the same, the rational is interior and the natural exterior; and 
as may be known it is according to order that the interior or purer can flow into the exterior or grosser, but not the reverse. [2] Hence it is that man's rational can be accommodated to truths and receive 
them before his natural, as may be plainly seen from the fact that with one who is to be regenerated the rational man battles much with the natural; or what is the same, the internal man with the 
external. For as also is known, the internal man can see truths and also will them, but the external refuses assent and resists; for in the natural man there are memory-knowledges which are in a great 
measure derived from the fallacies of the senses, and which notwithstanding their being false the man believes to be true; there are also things innumerable which the natural man does not apprehend; 
for he is relatively in shade and thick darkness, and that which he does not apprehend, he believes either not to exist, or not to be so; there are likewise cupidities which are of the love of self 
and of the world, and all things that favor these he calls truths; and when the man yields to these the dominion, all things that result are contrary to spiritual truths. There are also in the natural 
man reasonings that are grounded in falsities impressed from infancy. Moreover, man apprehends by manifest sense what is in his natural man, but not so what is in his rational, until he has put off the 
body. This also causes him to believe the body to be everything; and all that does not fall into the natural sense, he scarcely believes to be anything.  [3] From such causes and many others, it results 
that the natural man receives truths much later, and with greater difficulty, than does the rational man. Hence arises combat, which continues for a considerable time, not ceasing until the vessels 
recipient of good in the natural man have been softened by temptations, as before shown (n. 3318); for truths are nothing but vessels recipient of good (n. 1496, 1832, 1900, 2063, 2261, 2269), which 
vessels are harder in proportion as man is more fixedly confirmed in the things which have been mentioned; and if the man is to be regenerated, the more fixedly he has been confirmed, the more grievous 
is the combat. As the case with the natural man is such that the conjunction of truths with good therein is effected through the combats of temptations, it is therefore here repeated, "I am weary." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3321</b></p><p><b>3321.</b>
'For I am weary' means a state of conflict. This is clear from the meaning of 'weary' or weariness as a state of conflict, dealt with above in <a href="3318.htm">3318</a>. A second reference occurs here to his being weary 
so as to confirm the point that the joining together of good and truth within the natural is effected by means of spiritual conflicts, that is, by means of temptations. With regard to the joining together 
of good and truth in the natural, the position in general is that man's rational receives truths before his natural receives them, the reason being that the Lord's life which, as has been stated, 
is the life of His love, may be able to flow in by way of the rational into the natural, bring order into it, and make it submissive. For the rational is purer, and the natural grosser, or what amounts 
to the same, the former is interior, the latter exterior. It is according to order - an order that one can know - that the rational is able to flow into the natural, but not the natural into the rational. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
Consequently a person's rational is able to be adjusted to truths and to receive them before the natural does. This becomes quite clear from the fact that the rational man with someone 
who is to be regenerated conflicts greatly with the natural, or what amounts to the same, the internal man does so with the external. For as is also well known, the internal man is able to see truths 
and also to will them, but the external man refuses to see them and stands opposed to them. For in the natural man there are facts, which are to a great extent derived from the illusions of the senses, 
and which, although they are falsities, he nevertheless believes to be truths. There are also countless things which the natural man does not grasp, since the natural man, compared with the rational 
man, is in shade and thick darkness; and the things which the natural man does not grasp are thought not to exist or not to be so. There are also desires in the natural man which are those of self-love 
and love of the world, and the things which support those desires he calls truths. And when a person gives in to them everything that arises from them is contrary to spiritual truths. Present also 
are reasonings derived from falsities imprinted since early childhood. What is more, a person comprehends plainly with his senses the things which exist in his natural man, but less so those which exist 
in his rational until he has shed the body. This also causes him to suppose that the natural constitutes the whole, and what does not fall within the compass of his natural senses he believes to be 
scarcely anything. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 These and many others are the factors which cause the natural man to receive truths much later and with greater difficulty than the rational man receives them. Consequently 
conflict occurs, which persists for rather a long time and does not end until the recipient vessels of good in the natural man have been softened by means of temptations, as shown above in <a href="3318.htm">3318</a>; for truths 
are nothing else than recipient vessels of good, <a href="1496.htm">1496</a>, <a href="1832.htm">1832</a>, <a href="1900.htm">1900</a>, <a href="2063.htm">2063</a>, <a href="2261.htm">2261</a>, <a href="2269.htm">2269</a>. The harder those vessels are the more firmly is a person settled in the things referred to above. And the more 
firmly settled he is, the more serious is the conflict if he is to be regenerated. This therefore being the situation with the natural man - that the joining of truths to good in the natural man is 
effected by means of the conflicts brought about by temptations - Esau's statement 'I am weary' occurs a second time here. </p>

`Quia lassus ego': quod significet statum pugnae, constat ex significatione `lassi seu lassitudinis' quod sit status pugnae, de qua supra n. (x)3318; quod hic iterum dicatur lassus, est confirmationis 
causa quod conjunctio boni cum vero in naturali fiat per pugnas spirituales, hoc est, per tentationes: cum conjunctione boni cum vero in naturali ita in genere se habet, quod rationale hominis prius 
recipiat vera quam naturale ejus, et hoc ob causam ut vita Domini, quae, ut dictum, est amoris, influere possit per rationale in naturale, et hoc disponere, (c)et redigere ad oboedientiam, {1}rationale 
enim est purius, et naturale crassius, seu quod idem, illud est interius, hoc exterius; secundum ordinem est, qui notus (t)esse potest, quod illud influere possit in hoc, non autem vicissim; [2] inde 
est quod rationale hominis prius {2}possit accommodari veris, et illa recipere, quam naturale; hoc manifeste constare potest ex eo quod rationalis homo, apud regenerandum, multum pugnet cum naturali, 
seu quod idem, internus cum externo; internus enim homo, ut quoque notum est, videre potest vera et quoque velle illa, sed externus renuit et resistit; sunt enim in naturali homine scientifica, quae 
{3}multam sui partem trahunt ex fallaciis sensuum, quae tametsi falsa sunt, usque credit esse vera; sunt quoque innumerabilia quae naturalis homo non capit, est enim in umbra et caligine respective, 
et quae non capit, credit vel non existere vel non ita esse: sunt cupiditates quae sunt amoris sui et mundi, et illa quae (c)iis favent, vocat vera; et cum homo (c)iis dominium cedit, sunt omnia quae 
inde, contraria veris spiritualibus: sunt quoque ratiocinia ex falsis ab infantia impressis: et praeterea homo illa quae in naturali suo homine {4}sunt, sensu manifesto capit, non autem ita illa quae 
in ejus rationali, priusquam exutus est corpore; hoc quoque facit quod credat id esse omne, et quod {5}non in sensum naturalem cadit, vix credat esse aliquid: [3] talia et plura faciunt quod naturalis 
homo multo serius et difficilius recipiat vera quam rationalis ejus; inde pugna, quae satis diu perstat, nec cessat priusquam vasa recipientia boni in naturali homine per tentationes emollita sint, 
ut supra n. (x)3318 ostensum; nam vera non sunt nisi quam vasa recipientia boni, n. 1496, 1832, 1900, 2063, 2261, 2269; quae vasa eo duriora sunt, quo homo obfirmatior (t)est in illis, de quibus dictum; 
et quo obfirmatior, eo gravior pugna, si regenerandus. {6}Ideo quia ita se habet cum naturali homine, ut in illo vera conjungantur bono, et hoc {7}fiat per pugnas tentationum, hic iterum dicitur quod
