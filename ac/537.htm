<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第537节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">关于天堂与天堂之乐（二）</h4><br /><strong>537.</strong>有个灵曾靠近我左边，问我是否知道他怎样才能进入天堂。我蒙允许告诉他，进天堂的许可单单属于主，唯有祂知道人的秉性。很多尘世来的人执意进天堂，丝毫不知何为天堂与天堂之乐，也不知天堂就是彼此相爱，天堂之乐就是由此衍生的喜乐。故，那些对此一无所知者首先会通过亲身体验获知这一切。例如，有一个尘世来的新灵同样渴望天堂，为了让他直觉天堂的性质，其本性的内在被打开，以使他感受一点天堂之乐。但一触及到它，这灵就开始呻吟挣扎，恳求释放，呼救说，他痛苦得无法存活。于是其朝向天堂的本性内在再次被关闭，他才恢复过来。这个例子表明，那些没有为天堂做好准备的人，哪怕被允许进入一点点都会遭受什么样的良心痛苦和垂死挣扎！</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]537.</strong> Heaven and Heavenly Joy (Continued)<br />A spirit once latched onto me at my left, asking whether I knew how he could get into heaven. I was permitted to answer that being allowed into heaven was up to the Lord alone, since only he knows what we are like.<br />A large number of people coming from the world seek nothing more than to enter heaven, not having the least idea what heaven or heavenly joy is. They do not realize that heaven is the sharing of love, or that heavenly joy is the joy this love imparts. Those who do not know are first taught what heaven and its joy are, and one of the ways they learn is through personal experience.<br />For example, one spirit who himself had recently arrived from the world shared the same desire for heaven [as the first spirit]. To give him a sense of heaven's nature, his inner recesses were opened up so that he could feel something of heavenly joy, but when he felt it, he started to wail and writhe, begging to be released. He was so distressed that survival was impossible, he said. As a result, his inner reaches were closed off to heaven and he then revived.<br />This demonstrates how anxiety and the gnawing of conscience torture people who are let in to heaven for just a short time, if they are not right for it. </p>

CONTINUATION CONCERNING HEAVEN AND HEAVENLY JOY. A certain spirit attached himself to my left side, and asked me whether I knew how he could get into heaven. I was permitted to tell him that admission 
into heaven belongs solely to the Lord, who alone knows what a man's quality is. Very many arrive from the world who make it their sole pursuit to get into heaven, being quite ignorant of what heaven 
is, and of what heavenly joy is, that heaven is mutual love, and that heavenly joy is the derivative joy. Therefore those who do not know this are first instructed about it by actual experience. For 
example, there was a certain spirit, newly arrived from the world, who in like manner longed for heaven, and in order that he might perceive what the nature of heaven is, his interiors were opened so 
that he should feel something of heavenly joy. But as soon as he felt it he began to lament and to writhe, and begged to be delivered, saying that he could not live on account of the anguish; and therefore 
his interiors were closed toward heaven, and in this way he was restored. From this instance we may see with what pangs of conscience and with what anguish those are tortured who not being prepared 
for it are admitted even but a little way. </p>

HEAVEN AND HEAVENLY JOY - continued    A certain spirit once positioned himself on my left side and asked whether I knew how he could get into heaven. I was allowed to reply that admission into heaven 
belongs to the Lord alone, for He alone knows a person's character. Many people coming from the world are like this spirit; their one request is that they may enter heaven, without knowing at all 
what heaven is and what heavenly joy is. They do not know that heaven is mutual love, and heavenly joy the joy resulting from this. Consequently those who do not know this are first of all acquainted 
with what heaven is and what heavenly joy is, even by actual experience. This was also the case with a certain spirit who had recently come from the world and who had a similar desire for heaven. So that 
he might perceive the nature of heaven, the interiors of his being were opened so as to give him some feeling of heavenly joy. Once he had felt it he began to moan and to writhe about, pleading that 
he be set free and saying that he could not live in such agony. So the interiors of his being that had been turned in heaven's direction were closed again, and in this way he was restored. This shows 
the nature of the pangs of conscience and of the agony that afflict those who, when admitted for only a short while, do not really belong in that place.  </p>

Continuatio de Caelo et Gaudio caelesti </p>
<p>QUIDAM spiritus se applicuit lateri meo sinistro, quaerens num scirem quomodo intrare posset in caelum, cui respondere datum quod admitti in caelum 
sit solius Domini, Qui solus novit qualis est.  Tales sunt perplures qui e mundo veniunt, quod nihil aliud quaerant quam ut veniant in caelum, nescientes prorsus quid caelum, et quid gaudium caeleste; 
quod caelum sit amor mutuus, et quod gaudium caeleste sit gaudium inde; quare qui nesciunt, informantur primum quid caelum, et quid gaudium caeleste, etiam per vivam experientiam. Sicut quidam spiritus 
recens quoque e mundo qui similiter cupiebat caelum, ut perciperet quale caelum, interiora ejus aperiebantur ut aliquid de caelesti gaudio sentiret, quo sentito incepit lamentari et torqueri, supplicans 
ut liberaretur, vivere se prae anxietate non posse dicens; quare clausa sunt interiora ejus versus caelum, et sic restitutus. Inde constare potest quali conscientiae morsu et quali anxietate 
torquentur illi qui modo parumper admittuntur, dum non tales sunt. </p>
