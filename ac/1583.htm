<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1583节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1583．创世记13:10.</strong> 罗得举目看见约旦河的全平原，都有水灌溉，那地在耶和华未灭所多玛、蛾摩拉以先，如同耶和华的园子，也像你到琐珥时的埃及地。<br />“罗得举目”表外在人从内在人接受光明。“看见约旦河的全平原”表外在人中的良善和真理。“都有水灌溉”表它们能在那里增长。“在耶和华未灭所多玛、蛾摩拉以先”表在外在人未被恶欲和谬念毁灭之前。“那地如同耶和华的园子”表外在人中的理性事物。“也像你到琐珥时的埃及地”表从对良善的情感所获得的知识。这些话表示，当与内在人结合时，外在人在主看来就是这般美丽。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1583.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1583/bible_king-james-version_genesis_13_10" target=_top>Genesis 13:10</a>. And Lot raised his eyes and saw the whole plain of the Jordan, that it was all well watered (before Jehovah had destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah), like the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt as you come to Zoar.<br />And Lot raised his eyes means that his outer self was enlightened by his inner self. And saw the whole plain of the Jordan symbolizes the goodness and truth that existed in his outer self. That it was all well watered means that they are able to grow there. Before Jehovah had destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah symbolizes the outer self as destroyed by evil cravings and false or distorted convictions. Like the garden of Jehovah symbolizes the rational ideas of the outer self. Like the land of Egypt as you come to Zoar symbolizes facts acquired as a result of the desire for what is good.<br />The symbolism here is that the Lord witnessed his outer self at its most beautiful, when united with his inner self. </p>

Verse 10. And Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of Jordan, that it was all well watered, before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt in 
coming to Zoar. "And Lot lifted up his eyes," signifies that the external man was illuminated by the internal; "and saw all the plain of Jordan," signifies the goods and truths that are in the external 
man; "that it was all well watered," signifies that these can increase there; "before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah," signifies the external man destroyed by the cupidities of evil and the persuasions 
of falsity; "like the garden of Jehovah," signifies its rational things; "like the land of Egypt in coming to Zoar," signifies memory-knowledges from the affections of good. These things signify 
that the external man appeared to the Lord such as it is in its beauty when conjoined with the internal man. </p>

Verse 10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and he saw all the plain of Jordan, that the whole of it was well-watered, before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Jehovah, like the land 
of Egypt as you come to Zoar. </p>
<p>'And Lot lifted up his eyes' means that the external man received light from the internal. 'And he saw all the plain of Jordan' means the goods and truths that resided 
with the external man. 'That the whole of it was well-watered' means that they are able to grow there. 'Before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah' means before the external man was destroyed by desires 
for evil and by persuasions of falsity. 'Like the garden of Jehovah' means rational concepts in the external man. 'Like the land of Egypt as you come to Zoar' means facts acquired from affections 
for good. These statements mean that the external Man appeared to the Lord as it is in its beauty when joined to the Internal Man. </p>

Vers. 10.  Et sustulit Lot oculos suos, et vidit omnem planitiem Jordanis {1}, quod tota ea irrigua, antequam perdidit Jehovah Sodomam et Amoram, sicut hortus Jehovae, sicut terra Aegypti veniendo Zoar. 
'Et sustulit Lot oculos suos' significat quod externus homo illuminatus ab interno: 'et vidit omnem planitiem Jordanis {1}' significat illa bona et vera quae apud externum hominem: 'quod tota ea 
irrigua' significat quod crescere ibi possint: 'antequam perdidit Jehovah Sodomam et Amoram' significat hominem externum cupiditatibus mali et persuasionibus falsi destructum: 'sicut hortus Jehovae' significat 
ejus rationalia: 'sicut terra Aegypti veniendo Zoar' significat scientifica ab affectionibus boni.  Haec significant quod apparuerit Domino Externus homo qualis est in sua pulchritudine, cum 
Interno conjunctus. 	@1 In these three places and in n. 1591, I has Jardenis, but always Jordanis elsewhere.$ </p>
