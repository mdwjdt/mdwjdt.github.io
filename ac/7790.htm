<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7790节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7790.</strong>“然后我要出去”表神之真理要离开。这从“出去”的含义和“摩西”的代表清楚可知：“出去”是指离开；“摩西”是指神之真理。这些话的意思是说，当那些侵扰正直人的人受到诅咒时，所有神之真理都会离开他们，因为那时他们处于其邪恶的状态，邪恶弃绝并清除所有神之真理。在此之前，即在他们受到诅咒之前，他们的确熟知信之真理；但即便如此，他们仍没有真理在自己里面。真理在他们嘴上，却不在他们心里。因此，当他们在这些真理方面经历荒凉时，邪恶就会保留下来，同时藏在他们里面虚假也露出来。因为尽管他们宣称信仰真理，却没有处于真理，而是陷入虚假。此外，他们对信仰真理的宣称并非源于它自己的源头，即源于良善，而是源于邪恶；因为他们做出这种宣称，是为了利益、要职和名声，因而为自我世界。源于这种源头的真理附着在表面，因此，当它们被荒凉时，真理就像就像鳞片一样脱落；当它们脱落时，就会留下由于那里的恶人所散发的虚假而具有可怕腐臭味的地方。这就是那些曾经知道信之真理，然而却过着违背它们的生活之人的命运，正如主在路加福音中所说的：<br />仆人知道主人的意思，却不预备自己，又不照他的意思行，必多受责打；惟有那不知道的，做了当受责打的事，必少受责打。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路12.47.htm">12:47</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路12.48.htm">48</a>）</p>

And thereafter I will go out. That this signifies that truth Divine will depart, is evident from the signification of "going out," as being to depart; and from the representation of Moses, as being truth 
Divine. These things signify that when those who have infested the upright are damned, all truth Divine departs from them; for they are then in the state of their evil, and evil rejects and extinguishes 
all truth Divine. Heretofore, previous to their damnation, they were indeed acquainted with the truths of faith; but nevertheless they had no truths in them; for truths were then in their mouth, 
but not in the heart; and therefore when they have been vastated as to these truths, evil remains, and then also the falsity of evil comes forth to view which had lain hidden within them; for although 
they had professed truths, they were nevertheless not in truths, but in falsities. Moreover, the very profession of truth did not descend from its own beginning, namely, from good; but from evil; 
for they had made it for the sake of gain, honors, and reputation, thus for the sake of themselves and the world. The truths which descend from such a beginning adhere on the surface, and therefore when 
they are being vastated the truths fall off like scales, and when they fall off, they leave places that are foul-smelling and putrid from the falsities which exhale from the evils there. Such is the 
lot of those who have known the truths of faith, and yet have lived contrary to them, according to the Lord's words in Luke: </p>
<p>     That servant who knoweth his Lord's will, but maketh not himself ready, 
nor doeth his will, shall be beaten with many stripes; but he that knoweth not, though he do things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few (Luke 12:47-48). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7790</b></p><p><b>7790.</b>
'And after that I will go out' means that God's truth will depart. This is clear from the meaning of 'going out' as departing; and from the representation of 'Moses' as God's truth. These words mean 
that when those who have molested the upright are damned all God's truth departs from them, for then their state is one in which their own evil reigns, and evil rejects and eliminates all God's truth. 
Previously, before they were damned, they were, it is true, acquainted with the truths of faith; but even so, they did not have truths within themselves. Truths were on their lips but not in their hearts. 
Consequently, when they underwent vastation of those truths evil remained, and the falsity of evil that had lain concealed within them emerged at the same time also. For although they declared a 
belief in truths they were not guided by them but by falsities. Their declaration of belief in what is true did not spring from its proper origin - from good - but from evil; for gain, important positions, 
and reputation, and so self and the world, were the reasons for its existence with them. Truths which spring from that kind of origin cling to the surface, and therefore, when they are laid waste, 
they fall off like scales; and when they fall off they leave behind places with a terrible, rotten stink because of the falsities that emanate from the evils there. Such is the fate of those who have 
been acquainted with the truths of faith and yet have led a life contrary to them, as accords with the Lord's words in Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
That servant who knows the Lord's will, but neither prepares himself 
nor does his will, will be beaten with many [blows]. But he who does not know, although he does things worthy of blows, will be beaten with few. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2012:47,%2048&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 12:47, 48</a>.

`Et post ita exibo': quod significet quod verum Divinum discedet, constat ex significatione `exire' quod sit discedere; et ex repraesentatione `Moschis' quod sit verum Divinum.  Haec significant quod 
ab illis qui infestarunt probos, {1}cum damnantur, omne verum Divinum {2} discedat, nam tunc in statu mali sui sunt, et malum rejicit et exstinguit omne verum Divinum; prius, antequam {3}damnati sunt, 
vera fidei quidem sciverunt, sed usque vera {4}in se non habuerunt; vera enim tunc in ore (c)illorum fuerunt, non autem in corde; quapropter cum {5}quoad illa vastati sunt, remanet malum, et tunc quoque 
prodit falsum mali, quod reconditum in illis jacuerat; nam tametsi professi sunt vera, in illis tamen non fuerunt, sed {6} in falsis; ipsa etiam {7} professio veri, nec a suo principio, nempe ex 
bono, descendit, sed ex malo, nam fuit illis propter lucrum, honores, et famam, ita propter se et mundum.  Vera quae ex tali principio descendunt haerent in superficie, et inde, cum vastantur, sicut 
squamae decidunt, et cum decidunt, relinquunt loca graveolentia et putentia ex falsis quae ex malis ibi exhalant; talis sors est illorum qui sciverunt vera fidei et tamen vixerunt contra illa, secundum 
Domini verba apud Lucam, Ille servus qui scit voluntatem Domini, sed neque parat se, neque facit voluntatem ejus, percutietur multis: qui vero non novit, licet faciat digna plagis, percutietur paucis, 
xii 47, 48. 	@1 postquam damnati sunt$ 	@2 i, hoc est, omne verum fidei,$ 	@3 missi in infernum$ 	@4 After habuerunt$ 	@5 vastati sunt quoad scientia veri et boni fidei, tunc remanet malum, et 
quoque falsum mali quae intra illos fuerunt$ 	@6 i fuerunt$ 	@7 In A the rest of this   reads vera, quae professi, nec a suo principio, nempe ex bono, descenderunt, sed ex malo, nam professio veri 
fuit illis propter lucrum, honores, et famam.  Vera quae ex tali principio descendunt, (m)quia sunt vera oris, haerent solum in superficie, ac inde cum vastantur sicut squamae decidunt, et cum decidunt 
loca illa ubi fuerant, repleta sunt malis, ex quibus falsa continue exspirant, sunt ibi quasi ulcera graveolentia secundum impressiones gradus fidei; talis est sors illorum qui sciverunt vera fidei, 
et tamen vixerant vitam mali, Luc. xii 47, 48.(n)$ </p>
