<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2379节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2379.</strong>“将罗得拉进屋去，到自己身边”表主保护那些具有仁之善的人。这从“罗得”的代表和“拉进屋去，到自己身边”的含义清楚可知：“罗得”是指那些具有仁之善的人，如前所述；而“拉进屋去，到自己身边”是指保护；“拉进屋去”是指被引入良善；凡被引入良善者皆被引入天堂；凡被引入天堂者皆被引向主；因此，他们得到保护，其灵魂免受一切侵扰。就灵魂而言，凡拥有良善之人皆与天使相联，所以虽然活在肉身，他却身处天堂，尽管当时他没有意识到这一点，并且由于处于肉体之物和预备的状态而未能觉察到天使的喜乐（参看<a href="1277.htm">1277</a>节）。 </p>

And brought Lot into the house to them. That this signifies that the Lord protects those who are in the good of charity, is evident from the representation of Lot as being those who are in the good of 
charity (spoken of above); and from the signification of "bringing into the house to them," as being to protect. To be "brought into the house" denotes to be brought into good; and they who are brought 
into good are brought into heaven; and they who are brought into heaven are brought to the Lord; hence they are protected from all infestation as to their souls. That the man who is in good is as 
to his soul in society with angels, and while living in the body is nevertheless in heaven (although at the time he is not aware of this, and is not able to perceive angelic joy in consequence of being 
in corporeal things and in a state of preparation), may be seen above (n. 1277). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2379</b></p><p><b>2379.</b>
'And brought Lot into the house to them' means that the Lord affords protection to those with whom the good of charity is present. This is clear from the representation of 'Lot' as those with whom the 
good of charity is present, dealt with above, and from the meaning of 'bringing into the house to them' as affording protection. 'Being brought into the house' means being brought into good; and those 
who are brought into good are brought into heaven; and those who are brought into heaven are brought to the Lord and are consequently protected against every assault on their souls. As to his soul, 
anyone with whom good is present is in communion with angels; and so while living in the body he is nevertheless in heaven, though he is not directly conscious of it and is unable to perceive angelic 
joy because he is engrossed in bodily things and undergoing preparation [for heaven], see <a href="1277.htm">1277</a>. </p>

</p><b>2379.</b>
Quod `introduxerunt Lotum ad se in domum' significet quod Dominus tutetur eos qui in bono charitatis sunt, constat a repraesentatione `Loti' quod sint qui in bono charitatis sunt, de qua supra; et a 
significatione `introducere ad se in domum' quod sit tutari; `introduci in domum' est in bonum, et qui in bonum, introducuntur in caelum, et qui in caelum, est ad Dominum, inde tuti ab omni infestatione 
quoad animas: quod homo qui in bono, quoad animam sit in societate cum angelis, et sic cum vivit in corpore, usque in caelo, tametsi id (t)tunc non novit, nec potest angelicum gaudium percipere quia 
est in corporeis et in praeparatione, videatur n. 1277. </p>
