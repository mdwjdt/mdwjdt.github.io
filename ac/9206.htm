<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9206节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9206.</strong>“你们的妻子要成为寡妇”表与他们同在的良善会消亡。这从“妻子”和“寡妇”的含义清楚可知：“妻子”是指良善（参看<a href="6014.htm">6014</a>，<a href="8337.htm">8337</a>节），妻子之所以表示良善，是因为一个男人和一个女人的婚姻代表结合在一起的真理和良善，“男人”表示真理，“女人”表示良善（参看<a href="4510.htm">4510</a>，<a href="4823.htm">4823</a>节）；“寡妇”是指那些拥有良善，没有真理，却渴望真理的人（<a href="9198.htm">9198</a>节），不过在此是指那些不渴望真理的人，因为所论述的主题是苦待寡妇的恶人。正因如此，“寡妇”在此表示那些与其同在的良善正在消亡的人。<br />此处的情况是这样：那些拥有良善，但不渴望真理之人的良善并非真正的良善，因为正是真理使得良善成为真正的良善。事实上，良善从真理获得自己的具体品质（<a href="9154.htm">9154</a>节）。“属灵的良善”指的是与真理结合的良善；因此，当与人同在的真理消亡时，良善也就消亡了；反之，当良善消亡时，真理也就消亡了；因为它们之间的结合被切断和解除了（<a href="3804.htm">3804</a>，<a href="4149.htm">4149</a>，<a href="4301.htm">4301</a>，<a href="4302.htm">4302</a>，<a href="5835.htm">5835</a>，<a href="6917.htm">6917</a>，<a href="7835.htm">7835</a>，<a href="8349.htm">8349</a>，<a href="8356.htm">8356</a>节）。故从以下事实可以认识良善，即：它拥有为了良善的功用，因而为了生活而对真理的一种渴望和一种情感。就本身而言，为了生活而对真理的真正渴望或情感是一种与它结合的情感。这就像为了结合而渴望水或酒的食物或饼；因为它们彼此结合才能提供营养。这也像光和热，因为与热结合的光使地上万物萌发生长；但是，如果这种结合被切断，那么所萌发并生长的东西就会消亡。<br />良善怎样，一切快乐、愉悦、甜蜜、一致与和谐就怎样；这些喜乐不是凭它们自己，而是凭包含在它们里面的事物而这样。结合在一起的良善和真理使它们这样，并决定它们的特性。不过，凡有理解力的人，只要认真思考一下，就能知道包含在它们里面的事物哪些与良善有关，哪些与真理有关；因为在世界和天堂中的一切事物，因而宇宙万物，都与良善和真理有关；由它们所产生的一切事物皆同时与这二者有关，因而与它们的结合有关。这解释了为何古人将一切事物都比作婚姻（<a href="54.htm">54</a>，<a href="55.htm">55</a>，<a href="1432.htm">1432</a>，<a href="5194.htm">5194</a>，<a href="7022.htm">7022</a>节）；又为何圣言的每一个细节都有良善和真理的婚姻在里面（<a href="683.htm">683</a>，<a href="793.htm">793</a>，<a href="801.htm">801</a>，<a href="2516.htm">2516</a>，<a href="2712.htm">2712</a>，<a href="4138.htm">4138</a>，<a href="5138.htm">5138</a>，<a href="5502.htm">5502</a>，<a href="6343.htm">6343</a>，<a href="7945.htm">7945</a>，<a href="8339.htm">8339</a>e节）。</p>

And your women shall become widows. That this signifies that the goods with them will perish, is evident from the signification of "women," as being goods (see n. 6014, 8337); that "women" denote goods 
is because by the marriage of a man and a woman is represented the conjunction of truth and good (that by "a man" is signified truth, and by "a woman" good, see n. 4510, 4823); and from the signification 
of "widows," as being those who are in good and not in truths, but who nevertheless long for truths (n. 9198); but here those who do not long for truths, because the evil are spoken of who afflict 
widows, consequently those are meant with whom goods are perishing. [2] The case herein is this. Those who are in good, and do not long for truth, are not in good. The reason is that good becomes 
good by means of truths, for good receives its quality from truths (n. 9154). It is good conjoined with truth that is meant by "spiritual good;" and therefore when truth perishes with a man, good also 
perishes; and conversely, when good perishes, truth also perishes; for the conjunction is drawn asunder and dispersed (n. 3804, 4149, 4301, 4302, 5835, 6917, 7835, 8349, 8356). Thus good is known from 
the fact that it longs for truth and is affected with truth for the sake of a good use, thus for the sake of life. Regarded in itself the very longing, that is, the very affection of truth for the 
sake of life, is the affection of conjunction. This is like the longing of food or bread for water or wine, for the sake of conjunction; for when they are conjoined they nourish. It is also like light 
and heat, in that light conjoined with heat produces all things on the earth, and causes them to grow; but if the conjunction is severed, that which has been produced and has grown, perishes.  [3] As 
it is with good, so it is with all delight, pleasantness, sweetness, consent, and harmony. These things are not such from themselves, but from the things which are in them, the conjunction causing them 
to be such, and they being such according to the conjunction. But what things therein bear relation to good, and what to truth, may be known to the intelligent if they consider. For all things whatsoever 
that are in the world and that are in heaven, thus that are in the universe, bear relation to good and truth; and everything produced by these bears relation to both together, and thus to their 
conjunction. For this reason the ancients likened all things to marriage (n. 54, 55, 1432, 5194, 7022); and in each particular of the Word there is the marriage of good and truth (n. 683, 793, 801, 
2516, 2712, 4138, 5138, 5502, 6343, 7945, 8339). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9206</b></p><p><b>9206.</b>
'And your wives will become widows' means that forms of good with them will perish. This is clear from the meaning of 'wives' (mulier) as forms of good, dealt with in <a href="6014.htm">6014</a>, <a href="8337.htm">8337</a>, the reason why they 
mean forms of good being that the marriage of a man (vir) and a woman (mulier) represents truth and good joined together ('a man' means truth, and 'a woman' good, see <a href="4510.htm">4510</a>, <a href="4823.htm">4823</a>); and from the meaning 
of 'widows' as those who have good but not truths, and still have a desire for truths, <a href="9198.htm">9198</a>. But those who have no desire for truths are meant here, since the evil who afflict widows are the subject. 
So it is that 'widows' is used here to mean those with whom forms of good perish.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The situation is that the good of people who have good but no desire for truth is not real good, because truths 
are what make good real good. For good receives its specific quality from truths, see <a href="9154.htm">9154</a>. Good joined to truth is what is meant by spiritual good; therefore when truth perishes with a person, so 
too does good, and conversely when good perishes, so too does truth. For the bond between them is severed and dissolved, see <a href="3804.htm">3804</a>, <a href="4149.htm">4149</a>, <a href="4301.htm">4301</a>, <a href="4302.htm">4302</a>, <a href="5835.htm">5835</a>, <a href="6917.htm">6917</a>, <a href="7835.htm">7835</a>, <a href="8349.htm">8349</a>, <a href="8356.htm">8356</a>. Consequently good is 
recognized from this, that it has a desire and an affection for truth for the sake of good and useful service, thus for life's sake. Regarded in itself, the actual desire or affection for truth for life's 
sake is an affection for being joined to it. It is like food or bread that desires water or wine for the sake of combining with it; for combined with each other they provide nourishment. It is also 
like heat and light. Light combined with heat causes all things on the planet to spring forth and grow up; but if the combination is dissolved that which has sprung forth and grown up dies.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
As it is with good, so it is with all delight, pleasantness, sweetness, agreement, and harmony; these joys are such not of themselves but by virtue of the things they hold within them. Good and truth 
joined together make them such and determine their specific character. But what it is within them that has connection with good and what with truth is something that people who have understanding may 
recognize if they ponder on the matter; for everything whatever in the world, and everything whatever in heaven, thus in the whole of creation, has connection with good and with truth. Everything that 
has sprung forth from them has connection with both at the same time, thus with both joined together. This explains why all things were likened by the ancients to marriages, see <a href="54.htm">54</a>, <a href="55.htm">55</a>, <a href="1432.htm">1432</a>, <a href="5194.htm">5194</a>, <a href="7022.htm">7022</a>, and why every detail of the Word has the marriage of goodness and truth within it, <a href="683.htm">683</a>, <a href="793.htm">793</a>, <a href="801.htm">801</a>, <a href="2516.htm">2516</a>, <a href="2712.htm">2712</a>, <a href="4138.htm">4138</a>(end), <a href="5138.htm">5138</a>, <a href="5502.htm">5502</a>, <a href="6343.htm">6343</a>, <a href="7945.htm">7945</a>, <a href="8339.htm">8339</a> (end).  </p>

`Et fient mulieres vestrae viduae': quod significet quod bona apud illos peribunt, constat ex significatione `mulierum' quod sint bona, de qua n. 6014, (x)8337; quod `mulieres' sint bona, est quia per 
conjugium viri et mulieris repraesentatur {1} conjunctio veri et boni; quod per `virum' significetur {2} verum, et per `mulierem' bonum, videatur n. 4510, 4823; et ex significatione `viduarum' quod 
sint qui in bono et non in veris, sed usque desiderant vera, n. 9198, hic autem qui non desiderant vera, quia de malis qui affligunt viduas {3}; inde est quod per `viduas' hic intelligantur apud quos 
bona pereunt. 	[2] Cum hoc ita se habet: qui in bono sunt et non desiderant verum, illi non in bono sunt; causa est quia bonum fit bonum per vera, nam bonum accipit suum quale a veris, videatur n. 9154; 
bonum conjunctum vero est quod intelligitur per bonum spirituale, quapropter cum perit verum apud hominem, etiam perit bonum, et vice versa, cum perit bonum etiam perit verum, nam distrahitur et 
dissipatur conjunctio, videatur n. 3804, 4149, 4301, 4302, 5835, 6917, 7835, 8349, 8356; (t)inde cognoscitur bonum ex eo quod desideret verum et afficiatur vero propter usum bonum, ita propter vitam; 
ipsum desiderium, seu ipsa affectio veri propter vitam, in se spectata est affectio conjunctionis; se habet hoc sicut cibus aut panis quod desiderent aquam aut vinum conjunctionis causa, conjuncta enim 
nutriunt; se habet {4} quoque sicut lux et calor, lux conjuncta calori producit et vegetat omnia in tellure, at si {5} dissipatur conjunctio, perit quod productum ac (x)vegetatum est. 	[3] Sicut se 
habet cum bono, ita se habet cum omni jucundo, amoeno, dulci, consentiente, et harmonico; illa non talia sunt ex se sed ex illis quae insunt; conjunctio facit ut talia sint, et secundum conjunctionem 
sunt; quae autem inibi se referunt ad bonum, et quae ad verum, intelligentes scire possunt si expendunt, nam omnia quaecumque in mundo sunt, et quaecumque in caelo, ita {6} quae in universo, se referunt 
ad bonum et ad verum; omne productum ab illis ad utrumque simul, ita ad conjunctionem eorum; inde est quod antiqui omnia assimilaverint conjugiis, videatur n. 54, 55, 1432, 5194, 7022, et quod in 
singulis Verbi sit conjugium boni et veri, n. 683, 793, 801, 2516, 2712, 4138 fin., 5138, 5502, 6343, 7945, 8339 fin. @1 repraesentetur$ @2 quae est conjugium coeleste; inde per virum significatur$ @3
