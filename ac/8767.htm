<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8767.</strong>“遵守我的约”表由此过一种良善的生活，随之与主结合。这从“遵守约”的含义清楚可知，“遵守约”是指照诫命生活，因而活在良善中，从而与主结合。“遵守约”之所以表示照诫命生活，因而活在良善中，从而与主结合，是因为约的条款全都是所命令的东西，这些东西被称为“法度”（testimonies）、“典章”（judgments）、“律法”（laws）和“律例”（statutes），尤其被称为十诫。这一切也被称为“约”，因为约是通过它们得以确立的。“遵守”它们是指照它们生活，这一点从圣言中“遵守”的含义清楚可知，因为经上经常提到听从诫命，遵守它们，“听从”表示在信仰上接受它们，“遵守”表示在生活上接受它们，也就是照它们生活。“遵守约”之所以还表示与主结合，是因为就普遍意义而言，“约”表示结合（参看<a href="665.htm">665</a>，<a href="666.htm">666</a>，<a href="1023.htm">1023</a>，<a href="1038.htm">1038</a>，<a href="1864.htm">1864</a>，<a href="1996.htm">1996</a>，<a href="2003.htm">2003</a>，<a href="2021.htm">2021</a>，<a href="6804.htm">6804</a>节）。它还具有进一步的含义，因为照诫命生活的人与主结合。事实上，诫命教导生活，也赋予生活，由此打开通往天堂的路，打开人的眼去看见主。</p>

And keep My covenant. That this signifies life in good and the consequent conjunction, is evident from the signification of "keeping the covenant," as being to live according to the commandments, thus 
in good, and thus to be conjoined with the Lord. That "keeping the covenant" denotes living according to the commandments, thus in good, and thus being conjoined with the Lord, is because the articles 
of the covenant were all the things that were commanded, which were called "testimonies," "judgments," "laws," and "statutes;" specifically, the ten commandments. All these were also called "the covenant," 
because by means of these it was made. That "to keep" these denotes to live according to them, is evident from the signification of "keeping," in the Word, for frequent mention is there made 
of "hearing the commandments," and "keeping them," and by "hearing" is signified receiving them in faith, and by "keeping" receiving them in the life, that is, living according to them. That "to keep 
a covenant" denotes to be conjoined, is because in the universal sense by "a covenant" is signified conjunction (see n. 665, 666, 1023, 1038, 1864, 1996, 2003, 2021, 6804). This is for the reason that 
he who lives according to the commandments is conjoined with the Lord; for the commandments teach life and also give life, and thus open the way to heaven, and the sight to the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8767</b></p><p><b>8767.</b>
'And keep My covenant' means thus leading a good life, and as a consequence being joined [to the Lord]. This is clear from the meaning of 'keeping the covenant' as leading a life in accordance with the 
commandments, thus a life governed by good, and so being joined to the Lord. The reason why 'keeping the covenant' means leading a life in accordance with the commandments, thus leading a good life, 
is that the stipulations of the covenant were all the things that had been commanded, which were called testimonies, judgements, laws, and statutes, in particular the Ten Commandments. All these were 
also called the covenant because it was established through them. The fact that keeping them is leading a life in accordance with them is evident from the meaning of 'keeping' in the Word. Many times 
it speaks of hearing the commandments and keeping them, and in those places 'hearing' means accepting them in faith, and 'keeping' accepting them in life, that is, leading a life in accordance with 
them. The reason why 'keeping the covenant' also means being joined [to the Lord] is that in an overall sense 'a covenant' means being joined together, <a href="665.htm">665</a>, <a href="666.htm">666</a>, <a href="1023.htm">1023</a>, <a href="1038.htm">1038</a>, <a href="1864.htm">1864</a>, <a href="1996.htm">1996</a>, <a href="2003.htm">2003</a>, <a href="2021.htm">2021</a>, <a href="6804.htm">6804</a>. 
It has this further meaning because a person who leads a life in accordance with the commandments is joined to the Lord. For the commandments teach about life and also impart life, thereby opening 
the way to heaven and opening one's eyes to see the Lord. </p>

`Et custodiveritis foedus Meum': quod significet vitam in bono et inde conjunctionem, constat ex significatione `custodire foedus' quod sit vivere secundum praecepta, ita in bono, {1}et sic conjungi 
Domino; quod `custodire foedus' sit vivere secundum praecepta, ita in bono, est quia pacta foederis erant omnia quae mandata sunt, quae testimonia, judicia, leges, et statuta dicta sunt, in specie decem 
praecepta; {2}haec et illa etiam vocabantur foedus, quia per illa pangebatur; quod (c)ea custodire sit secundum (c)ea vivere, patet ex significatione {3} `custodire' in Verbo, pluries enim dicitur 
audire praecepta et custodire illa, ac ibi per `audire' significatur recipere illa fide, et per `custodire' recipere illa vita, hoc est, vivere secundum illa; quod etiam `custodire foedus' sit {4}conjunctio, 
est quia per `foedus' in universali sensu significatur conjunctio, n. 665, 666, 1023, 1038, 1864, 1996, 2003, 2021, 6804; {5}hoc inde est quia qui vivit secundum praecepta conjungitur Domino;
