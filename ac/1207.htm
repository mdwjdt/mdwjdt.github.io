<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1207.</strong>创世记10:19.迦南的边界是从西顿向基拉耳的路上，直到迦萨；又向所多玛、蛾摩拉、押玛、洗扁的路上，直到拉沙。<br />此处和前面一样，“西顿”表外在认知。“基拉耳”表已揭示的有关信的事物。“迦萨”表已揭示的有关仁的事物。“迦南的边界是从西顿向基拉耳的路上，直到迦萨”表对真理和良善的认知朝那些具有缺乏内在的外在敬拜之人延伸。“又向所多玛、蛾摩拉、押玛、洗扁的路上，直到拉沙”表包围他们的虚假和邪恶。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1207.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1207/bible_king-james-version_genesis_10_19" target=_top>Genesis 10:19</a>. And the border of the Canaanites reached from Sidon as you come to Gerar, as far as Gaza, as you come to Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.<br />Here as earlier, Sidon symbolizes superficial knowledge. Gerar symbolizes information revealed about faith. Gaza symbolizes information revealed about charity. The border of the Canaanites reached from Sidon as you come to Gerar, as far as Gaza, symbolizes knowledge extending to include the truth and goodness in people who worship outwardly but not inwardly. As you come to Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, as far as Lasha, symbolizes the falsity and evil in which that knowledge ends. </p>

Verse 19. And the border of the Canaanite was from Zidon, in coming to Gerar, even unto Gaza, in coming to Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboiim, even unto Lasha. By "Zidon," here as before, exterior 
knowledges are signified; by "Gerar" are signified the things that are revealed concerning faith; by "Gaza" the things that are revealed concerning charity; "the border of the Canaanites was from 
Zidon, in coming to Gerar, even unto Gaza," signifies the extension of knowledges to truth and good, with those who have external worship without internal; "in coming to Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and 
Zeboiim, even unto Lasha," signifies the falsities and evils in which they terminate. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1207</b></p><p><b>1207.</b>
Verse 19 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon as you come towards Gerar, as far as Gaza, as you come towards Sodom and Gomorrah, and Admah and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha. </p>
<p>Here, as previously, 
'Sidon' means exterior cognitions. 'Gerar' means things that have been revealed concerning faith. 'Gaze' means things that have been revealed concerning charity. 'The border of the Canaanites was 
from Sidon as you come towards Gerar, as far as Gaza' means the extension of cognitions towards truth and good with those who have external worship devoid of internal. 'As you come towards Sodom, Gomorrah, 
Admah, Zeboiim, as far as Lasha' means the falsities and evils which encompass them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1207</b>
</p><b>1207.</b>
Vers. 19.  Et fuit terminus Canaanitarum a Zidone veniendo ad Gerar, usque ad Azzam, veniendo ad Sodomam, et Amoram, et Admam, et Zeboim, usque ad Lasha.  Per 'Zidonem' hic ut prius, significantur cognitiones 
exteriores:  per 'Gerar' significantur illa quae sunt revelata de fide:  per 'Azzam' illa quae sunt revelata de charitate:  'quod terminus Canaanitarum fuerit a Zidone  veniendo ad Gerar usque 
ad Azzam' significant extensionem cognitionum ad verum et bonum apud eos qui cultum externum absque interno habent:  'veniendo ad Sodomam, Amoram, Admam, Zeboim, usque ad Lasha' significant falsa 
et mala, in quibus terminantur. </p>
