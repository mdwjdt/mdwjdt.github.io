<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>364.</strong>其次说“你若行得不好，罪就伏在你门前”，意思是，若你所愿非善，就没有仁存在，而只有恶。谁都能看出，“罪就伏在你门前”是指恶预备好并渴望进入，因为哪里无仁，哪里就有残忍与仇恨，从而尽是恶。“罪”通常被称为魔鬼，当人缺乏仁时，魔鬼及其同伙就会临近。将魔鬼及其同伙逐出心门的唯一方法，就是爱主爱邻。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]364.</strong> The second phrase was if you do not do well, sin lies at your door, meaning if you do not wish well, there is no charity, but only evil. Anyone can see that when sin lies at the door it is an evil near at hand and eager to get in. When charity is missing, after all, ruthlessness and hatred and therefore every kind of evil are present.<br />The general term sin is taken to mean the Devil, and the Devil — or rather the Devil's crew — is nearby when we lack charity. The only thing that chases them from the door is love for the Lord and for our neighbor. </p>

Secondly, it is said, "If thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door" which signifies, If thou art not well disposed, there is no charity present, but evil. Everybody can see that "sin lying at the door" 
is evil ready and desirous to enter; for when there is no charity there are unmercifulness and hatred, consequently all evil. Sin in general is called the "devil" who, that is, his crew of infernals, 
is ever at hand when man is destitute of charity; and the only means of driving away the devil and his crew from the door of the mind, is love to the Lord and toward the neighbor. </p>

(<a href="2.htm">2</a>) 'If you do not do well, sin is lying at the door', which means that if your desires are not good charity does not exist, but evil. That 'sin lying at the door' means evil at hand and wishing to get 
in may become clear to anyone. Indeed when charity does not exist hatred and lack of compassion do so, which are the source of all evil. 'Sin' stands in general for the devil, and he, that is, his 
crew, is at hand when a person is devoid of charity. Only one thing will drive the devil and his crew away from the door, and that is love to the Lord and towards the neighbour.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 364</b>
</p><b>364.</b>
Alterum erat 'Si non benefacis, ad januam peccatum cubans,' quo significatur, si non benevis, quod charitas nulla, sed malum; quod 'peccatum' dum 'ad januam cubat,' sit malum, quod praesto est et intrare 
vult, unicuivis constare potest; dum enim nulla charitas, est immisericordia et odium, proinde omne malum. Peccatum in genere pro diabolo sumitur, qui, seu turba ejus, praesto est dum homo absque 
charitate est; unicum quod diabolum et ejus turbam a janua profugat, est amor in Dominum et erga proximum. </p>
