<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1875节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1875.</strong>我被恩准觉察关于主祷文中这些话的天使观念：“不叫我们遇见试探，救我们脱离凶恶”。离我最近的善灵开始通过我里面可觉察到的某种概念清除“试探”和“凶恶”，并且这一过程一直持续到只有纯粹的天使之物，即良善保留下来，而毫无试探和凶恶的概念，字义就这样完全消失了。在初次清除时，关于这善的无数观念被形成：例如，良善如何出自人的痛苦，而痛苦则源于这个人及其自带惩罚的邪恶。伴随这些观念的，还有对以下观点的一种义愤：即人以为试探及其邪恶出自其它源头，并且人在思想主时，也会有邪恶的想法。这些观念会随着它们上升而逐渐得到净化。这些上升由前面所描述的清除（<a href="1393.htm">1393</a>节）来代表，并且清除以难以描述的方式迅速完成，直到它们进入我思维的阴影中。那时，它们处于天堂，在那里，关于主的良善只有无法形容的天使观念。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1875.</strong> I was given the opportunity to perceive angels' ideas on the following words in the Lord's Prayer: "Do not lead us into crisis but free us from evil" [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1875/bible_king-james-version_matthew_6_13" target=_top>Matthew 6:13</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1875/bible_king-james-version_luke_11_4" target=_top>Luke 11:4</a>]. The good spirits nearest me discarded crisis and evil by a certain way of thinking perceptible to me. They rejected those ideas so thoroughly that what remained was purely angelic; specifically, what was left was goodness, without a hint of crisis or evil. In this way, the literal meaning died away completely. The first step of the process was to form countless ideas of this goodness — how something beneficial comes of our affliction, and yet the affliction rises out of us and our evil, which contains its own penalty. Attached to these ideas was a kind of indignation that anyone should think that crises and their evils come from anywhere else, and that anyone should think about evil when thinking about the Lord. These ideas were purified as they rose higher and higher. Their journey upward was represented by the discarding of certain elements, as also described in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1875/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1393" target=_top>1393</a>. These elements were discarded in a manner and with a speed that are impossible to express, until the ideas finally passed into an area of thought that was shadowy to me. Then they were in heaven, where the angels think only of the Lord's goodness, in thoughts that are ineffable. </p>

It was granted me to have a perception of angelic ideas about these words in the Lord's Prayer: "Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil." Temptation and evil were rejected by the nearest 
good spirits, by a certain idea perceptible within me, and this even until what is purely angelic, namely, Good,, remained, without any idea of temptation and evil; the literal sense thus perishing 
altogether. In the first rejection innumerable ideas were being formed respecting this Good-how good may come from man's affliction while the affliction still is from the man and his evil, in which there 
is punishment, and this with a kind of indignation joined with it that it should be thought that temptation and its evil come from any other source, and that anyone should have any thought of evil 
in thinking of the Lord. These ideas were purified in the degree of their ascent. The ascents were represented by rejections (spoken of also n. 1393), which were made with a rapidity and in a manner 
that were inexpressible, until they passed into the shade of my thought. They were then in heaven, where there are only ineffable angelic ideas concerning the Lord's good. </p>

I was allowed to see the angelic ideas surrounding these words in the Lord's Prayer, 'Do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil'. Good spirits nearest to me began to remove 'temptation' 
and 'evil' by a certain idea that was perceptible within me, and this they continued to do until that which was purely angelic, that is, good, remained, and no idea of temptation or evil was there - 
the literal sense thereby perishing altogether. Of that good countless ideas were being formed when that removal first began - ideas of how good may come out of a person's affliction when yet the affliction 
originates in that person and in his evil, which holds punishment within it. And coupled with these ideas there was a kind of indignation that people should suppose that temptation and the evil 
going with it should come from any other source, and that there should be any thought of evil when they thought about the Lord. These ideas were being purified every time they rose up higher. These 
risings were represented by removals, also described in <a href="1393.htm">1393</a>, which were carried out with a rapidity and in a manner that were indescribable, until they passed into the shadowy side of my thought. At 
that point they were in heaven where angelic ideas beyond words exist regarding that good which is the Lord's. </p>

</p><b>1875.</b>
Datum appercipere ideas angelicas in Oratione Domini circa haec verba, 'ne inducas nos in tentationem, sed libera nos a malo'; a spiritibus bonis proximis idea quadam apud me perceptibili rejiciebatur 
'tentatio et malum,' et hoc eo usque, dum pure angelicum, nempe 'bonum,' absque idea tentationis et mali, remaneret, pereunte sic prorsus sensu litterali; de quo bono in prima rejectione formabantur 
innumerabiles ideae, quomodo bonum ex afflictione hominis veniat, et usque afflictio ex homine et ejus malo cui inest poena, et hoc cum adjuncta specie indignationis quod opinarentur tentationem et 
ejus malum aliunde venire, et quod cogitandum de malo, cum de Domino; hae ideae purificabantur quo ascendebant altius; ascensus repraesentati sunt per rejectiones, de quibus etiam n. 1393, quae fiebant 
velocitate et modo inexpressibili, usque dum in umbram cogitationis meae transirent; tunc erant in caelo, ubi ideae angelicae ineffabiles solum de bono Domini. </p>
