<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5619节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5619.</strong>“带下去送给那人作礼物”表获得青睐。这从“送给那人作礼物”的含义清楚可知，“送给那人作礼物”（“那人”是约瑟，约瑟被称为那地的主人），是指获得青睐。古代代表性教会，因而犹太教会有一个习俗：当人们去见审判官，后来去见国王或祭司时，会送给他们一个礼物；事实上，人们被吩咐如此行。这种习俗的原因是，他们所送的礼物代表当靠近主时，诸如人里面应献给主的那类事物。这些礼物是人自由献出的，因而是真正出于他自己的礼物。因为他的自由就在于发自他内心的东西；发自他内心的，来自他的意愿；来自意愿的，来自属于爱的情感；来自属于爱的情感的，就是他的自由，因而是真正属于这个人自己的东西（参看<a href="1947.htm">1947</a>，<a href="2870.htm">2870</a>-<a href="2893.htm">2893</a>，<a href="3158.htm">3158</a>节）。这就是人在靠近主时要送礼物给主的由来。上述礼物就代表这种礼物，因为“王”代表神性真理方面的主（<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>，<a href="3009.htm">3009</a>，<a href="3670.htm">3670</a>，<a href="4581.htm">4581</a>，<a href="4966.htm">4966</a>，<a href="5044.htm">5044</a>节），而“祭司”代表神性良善方面的主（<a href="1728.htm">1728</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="3670.htm">3670</a>节）。这些礼物还起到引见的作用（参看<a href="4262.htm">4262</a>节）；引见是为了获得青睐。</p>

And carry down the man a present. That this signifies obtaining favor, is evident from the signification of "offering a present to the man," here to Joseph, who is called the "lord of the land," as being 
to obtain favor. It was customary in the Ancient representative Church, and thence in the Jewish, to give some present to judges, and at a later period to kings and priests, when they were approached; 
moreover, this was commanded. The reason was that the presents they gave them represented such things in man as ought to be offered to the Lord when He is approached, which are things that are from 
freedom, consequently from the man himself; for his freedom is what is from the heart, and what is from the heart is from the will, and what is from the will is from the affection which is of the 
love, and what is from the affection which is of the love is free, thus of the man himself (see n. 1947, 2870-2893, 3158). From this it is that a present should be given by man to the Lord on approaching 
Him. It was this present that was represented; for kings represented the Lord as to Divine truth (n. 1672, 2015, 2069, 3009, 3670, 4581, 4966, 5044), and priests as to Divine good (n. 1728, 2015, 
3670). That these presents were initiations, see n. 4262; and initiations are for obtaining favor. </p>

'And cause a gift to go down to the man' means to obtain favour. This is clear from the meaning of 'taking a gift to the man' - 'the man' being Joseph, who is called the lord of the land - as to obtain 
favour. It was customary in the representative Ancient Church, and so in the Jewish Church, when people went to the judges, and at a later time to the kings or priests, to present them with a gift; 
indeed the people were commanded to do this. The reason for the custom was that the gifts people presented to those men represented the kinds of things mankind possessed that ought to be offered to the 
Lord when any approach is made to Him. Such gifts are ones that a person offers in freedom and therefore ones that come truly from himself. For his freedom resides in what comes from his heart; and 
what comes from his heart comes from his will. Also what comes from his will comes from a desire arising out of his love; and a desire arising out of his love constitutes his freedom, thus what is truly 
his own, <a href="1947.htm">1947</a>, <a href="2870.htm">2870</a>-<a href="2893.htm">2893</a>, <a href="3158.htm">3158</a>. Such should be the origin of any gift made by man to the Lord when making any approach to Him. This kind of gift was represented by the gifts mentioned above, for 'kings' 
represented the Lord as regards Divine Truth, <a href="1672.htm">1672</a>, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="2069.htm">2069</a>, <a href="3009.htm">3009</a>, <a href="3670.htm">3670</a>, <a href="4581.htm">4581</a>, <a href="4966.htm">4966</a>, <a href="5044.htm">5044</a>, while 'priests' represented Him as regards Divine Good, <a href="1728.htm">1728</a>, <a href="201.htm">201</a>-<a href="5.htm">5</a>(end), <a href="3670.htm">3670</a>. Those gifts also served 
as introductions, see <a href="4262.htm">4262</a>, which were made to obtain favour. </p>

`Et descendere facite viro munus':  quod significet ad obtinendam gratiam, constat ex significatione `offerre munus' {1}viro hic Josepho, qui vocatur dominus terrae', quod sit ad obtinendam gratiam: 
 sollemne fuerat in Ecclesia repraesentativa Antiqua, et inde in Judaica, judicibus, et postea regibus et sacerdotibus dare aliquid muneris cum illos adirent, mandatum etiam hoc fuit; causa erat quia 
munera quae illis dabant, repraesentabant talia apud hominem quae offerri debent {2}Domino cum aditur, quae sunt quae ex libero, proinde ex ipso homine, nam liberum ejus est quod ex corde, et quod ex 
corde est ex voluntate, et quod ex voluntate est ex affectione quae amoris, et quod ex affectione quae amoris, est liberum, ita ipsius hominis, n. 1947,2870-2893, 3158; ex hoc ab homine dabitur munus 
{2}Domino cum aditur; hoc munus erat quod repraesentabatur; `reges' enim repraesentabant Dominum quoad Divinum Verum, n. 1672, 2015, 2069, 3009, (x)3670, 4581, 4966, 5044, {3}; et `{4} sacerdotes' quoad 
Divinum Bonum, n. 1728, 2015 fin., 3670; quod munera illa essent initiationes, videatur n. 4262; et initiationes {5}sunt ad obtinendam gratiam. @1 ei qui dominus erat terrae$ @2 Deo$ @3 i 5068$ @4
