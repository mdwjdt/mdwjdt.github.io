Verses 9-12. And Moses said unto Aaron, Say unto all the assemblage of the sons of Israel, Come ye near before Jehovah, for He hath heard your murmurings. And it was, as Aaron spake unto the whole assemblage 
of the sons of Israel, that they looked back unto the wilderness, and behold the glory of Jehovah was seen in the clouds. And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, I have heard the murmurings of 
the sons of Israel; speak unto them, saying, Between the evenings ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be sated with bread; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God.  "And Moses said unto 
Aaron," signifies the influx of truth Divine proceeding immediately from the Lord through the truth Divine which proceeds mediately; "Say unto all the assemblage of the sons of Israel," signifies 
instruction; "Come ye near before Jehovah," signifies a state of reception, and the application thereto; "for He hath heard your murmurings," signifies that He may bring aid on account of the suffering 
in the temptation; "and it was, as Aaron spake unto the whole assemblage of the sons of Israel," signifies instruction from the Divine by means of influx; "that they looked back unto the wilderness," 
signifies a recalling to mind of the state of temptation in which they had been; "and behold the glory of Jehovah was seen in the cloud," signifies the presence of the Lord in truth accommodated to 
the perception; "and Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying," signifies the truth which proceeds from the Divine of the Lord, and in which is the Lord's presence; "I have heard the murmurings of the sons of 
Israel," signifies that the complaints arising from the temptation will cease; "speak unto them, saying," signifies information by means of influx; "Between the evenings ye shall eat flesh," signifies 
that in the end of the state good will be appropriated by means of delight; "and in the morning ye shall be sated with bread," signifies that in the beginning of a new state they shall have as much 
good as they can receive; "and ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God," signifies that they may know that the Lord is the only God. </p>

Verses 9-12 And Moses said to Aaron, Say to all the assembly of the children of Israel, Come near before Jehovah, for He has heard your grumblings. And so it was, as Aaron was speaking to all the assembly 
of the children of Israel, that they looked back towards the wilderness, and behold, the glory of Jehovah was seen in the cloud. And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, I have heard the grumblings of 
the children of Israel. Speak to them, saying, At evening<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> you will eat flesh, and in the morning you will be filled with bread; and you will know that I am Jehovah your God. </p>
<p>'And Moses said to Aaron' 
means an influx of God's truth that goes forth directly from the Lord, expressing itself through God's truth that goes forth in an indirect way. 'Say to all the assembly of the children of Israel' 
means instruction. 'Come near before Jehovah' means a state in which that influx is accepted and applied. 'For He has heard your grumblings' means in order that He may bring help because of their grief 
in temptation. 'And so it was, as Aaron was speaking to all the assembly of Israel' means instruction received from the Divine through influx. 'That they looked back towards the wilderness' means 
recollecting the state of temptation in which they had been. 'And behold, the glory of Jehovah was seen in the cloud' means the Lord's presence within truth adjusted to their discernment. 'And Jehovah 
spoke to Moses, saying' means truth that goes forth from the Lord's Divine and holds the Lord's presence within it. 'I have heard the grumblings of the children of Israel' means that there will be an 
end to the complaints which the temptation gives rise to. 'Speak to them, saying' means instructions conveyed through influx. 'At evening you will eat flesh' means that at the end of a state good will 
become their own through delight. 'And in the morning you will be filled with bread' means that at the beginning of a new state they will have as much good as they can receive. 'And you will know that 
I am Jehovah' means in order that they may know that the Lord is the only God.

Vers. 9-12.  Et dixit Moscheh ad Aharonem', Dic ad omnem coetum filiorum Israelis, Appropinquate coram Jehovah, quia audivit murmurationes vestras.  Et fuit ut loqui Aharon ad omnem coetum filiorum 
Israelis, et respexerunt ad desertum, et ecce gloria Jehovae visa in nube.  Et locutus est Jehovah ad Moschen, dicendo, Audivi murmurationes filiorum Israelis; loquere ad illos, dicendo, Inter vesperas 
comedetis carnem, et in matuta satiabimini pane, et cognoscetis quod Ego Jehovah Deus vester.  `Et dixit Moscheh ad Aharonem' significat influxum veri Divini immediate a Domino procedentis per verum 
Divinum quod mediate: `Dic ad omnem coetum filiorum Israelis' significat instructionem: `Appropinquate coram Jehovah' significat statum receptionis et applicationem ad illum: `quia audivit murmurationes

significat recordationem status tentationis in quo fuerunt: `et ecce gloria Jehovae visa in nube' significat praesentiam Domini in vero accommodato ad apperceptionem: `et locutus est Jehovah ad Moschen,

principio status novi habebitur bonum quantum recipere possent: `et cognoscetis quod Ego, Jehovah' significat ut sciant quod Dominus solus Deus. </p>
