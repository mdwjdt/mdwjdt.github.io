Verses 10-16. And let them make an ark of shittim wood; two cubits and a half the length thereof and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. And thou shalt 
overlay it with pure gold, from within and from without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a border of gold round about. And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them upon the 
four corners thereof; and two rings shall be on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it. And thou shalt make staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold. And thou shalt put the 
staves into the rings on the sides of the ark, to carry the ark withal. The staves shall be in the rings of the ark; they shall not be removed from it. And thou shalt put into the ark the Testimony 
which I shall give thee. "And let them make an ark," signifies the inmost heaven; "of shittim wood," signifies righteousness; "two cubits and a half the length thereof," signifies all in respect to good; 
"and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof," signifies full in respect to truth; "and a cubit and a half the height thereof," signifies full in respect to degrees; "and thou shalt overlay it with 
pure gold," signifies that all these things must be founded on good; "from within and from without shalt thou overlay it," signifies everywhere; "and shalt make upon it a border of gold round about," 
signifies a fixing of the bounds by good, lest they be approached and injured by evils; "and thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it," signifies the Divine truth conjoined with Divine good that is 
round about on all sides; "and put them upon the four corners thereof," signifies stability; "and two rings shall be on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it," signifies the marriage 
of truth with good and of good with truth; "and thou shalt make staves of shittim wood," signifies the power thence derived; "and overlay them with gold," signifies good everywhere; "and thou shalt 
put the staves into the rings," signifies the power of the Divine sphere; "on the sides of the ark," signifies in ultimates; "to carry the ark withal," signifies thus the coming-forth and subsistence 
of heaven; "the staves shall be in the rings of the ark," signifies that the power shall endure from the Divine sphere of good and truth; "they shall not be removed from it," signifies forever, without 
change; "and thou shalt put into the ark the Testimony," signifies the Divine truth, which is the Lord in heaven; "which I shall give thee," signifies its representative. </p>

Verses 10-16 And they are to make an ark of shittim wood; two cubits and a half shall be its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height. And you shall overlay it with 
pure gold, on the inside and on the outside you shall overlay it; and you shall make on it a rim of gold round about. And you shall cast four rings of gold for it, and put them on its four corners; 
and two rings shall be on one side of it and two rings on the other side of it. And you shall make poles of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold. And you shall put the poles into the rings on the 
sides of the ark, to carry the ark on them. The poles must be in the rings of the ark; they must not be removed from it. And you shall put into the ark the Testimony which I shall give you.  </p>
<p>'And 
they are to make an ark' means the inmost heaven. 'Of shittim wood' means righteousness. 'Two cubits and a half shall be its length' means all so far as good is concerned. 'And a cubit and a half its 
breadth' means what is complete so far as truth is concerned. 'And a cubit and a half its height' means what is complete so far as degrees are concerned. 'And you shall overlay it with pure gold' means 
that all those aspects must be founded on good. 'On the inside and on the outside you shall overlay it' means everywhere. 'And you shall make on it a rim of gold round about' means a border of good, 
serving to defend them from the approach of evils and the harm these can do. 'And you shall cast four rings of gold for it' means Divine Truth joined to Divine Good, which lie in every direction round 
about. 'And put them on its four corners' means firmness. 'And two rings shall be on one side of it and two rings on the other side of it' means the marriage of truth to good and of good to truth. 'And 
you shall make poles of shittim wood' means power derived from this. 'And overlay them with gold' means good in all directions. 'And you shall put the poles into the rings' means the power of the 
Divine sphere. 'On the sides of the ark' means in the outermost parts. 'To carry the ark on them' means thereby bringing heaven into being and keeping it in being. 'The poles must be in the rings of the 
ark' means that the power must be established by the Divine sphere of goodness and truth. 'They must not be removed from it' means everlastingly and unalterably so. 'And you shall put into the ark 
the Testimony' means Divine Truth, which is the Lord in heaven. 'Which I shall give you' means its representative.  </p>

Vers.  10-16. Et faciant arcam lignorum schittim, duo cubiti et dimidius longitudo ejus, ac cubitus et dimidius latitudo ejus, ac cubitus et dimidius altidudo ejus.  Et obduces illam auro puro, ab intra

super latere ejus altero. Et facies vectes lignorum schittim, et obduces illos auro. Et induces vectes in annulos super lateribus arcae, ad portandum arcam in illis. In annulis arcae erunt vectes, {1}non
