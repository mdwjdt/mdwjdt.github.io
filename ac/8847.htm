<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8847节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8847.</strong>来自另一个星球的一个灵人与我同在（他来自木星），他请求我为他代祷，好叫他能进入天堂。他说，他没有意识到做了坏事，只是斥责了木星居民；又补充说，斥责之后他又教导了他们。他把自己放在我的左肘下，仿佛用哭丧似的声音说话。他还能唤起怜悯之情。然而，我能给予他的唯一回答是，我无法给予他任何帮助。我告诉他，进入天堂唯独依靠主。我也不能代祷，因为我不知道这是否有用；不过，他若配得，就有希望。这时，他被送回属他自己星球的正直灵人当中；但这些灵人却说，他不能和他们在一起，因为他和他们不一样。然而，他因出于强烈的渴望再三要求被允许进入天堂，故被送到这个星球的正直灵人的社群。可这些灵人也说，他不能和他们呆在一起。此外，在天堂之光中，他的颜色是黑的，尽管他自己声称这是黑色，而是红棕色。<br />我被告知，这就是这类人起初的样子，后来他们被接纳到那些构成精囊区域的人当中。精液（精子）积聚在这些囊泡中，周围包裹着适当物质，恰好可以防止它散失，并能在子宫颈处脱落，以便储存在里面的精子能有助于受孕，也就是使卵子受孕。因此，这种精液物质也含有一种努力在里面，可以说有一种燃烧的渴望，即：脱落自己，留下精子履行它的功用或说实现它的目的。类似的事也发生在这个灵人身上。他回到我这里，不过现在穿上了简陋的衣服。他又说他燃烧着上天堂的渴望，并且现在发觉自己适合留在那里。但我被引导对他说，这或许表明他将很快被接纳。这时天使叫他扔掉他的衣服；他出于他的渴望迅速把它扔掉，几乎没有比这更迅速的了。这代表那些在对应于精囊的区域里的人，其渴望是何性质。</p>

A certain spirit from another earth was with me (he was from the earth Jupiter) who earnestly begged me to intercede for him, that he might come into heaven. He said that he was not aware of having done 
what is evil, except that he had rebuked the inhabitants of that earth; adding that after he had rebuked, he instructed them. He applied himself to my left side under the elbow, and talked with as 
it were a broken voice, and he could move one to pity. But I could only reply that I could give him no help, and that this is of the Lord alone; and that I could not intercede, because I did not know 
whether it would be useful or not, but that if worthy he might hope. He was then sent back among the upright spirits from his own earth; but these said that he could not be in their company, because 
he was not such as they. Yet because with intense longing he importuned to be let into heaven, he was sent into a society of upright spirits of this earth; but they also said that he could not be with 
them. In the light of heaven he was of a black color, but he himself said that he was not of a black, but of a murrhine color. I was told that they are such in the beginning who are afterward received 
among those who constitute the province of the seminal vesicles; for in these vesicles the semen is collected and clothed around with a suitable material, fitted for preserving it from being dissipated, 
and which can be put off in the neck of the womb, that so what has been preserved within may serve for conception, that is, for the impregnation of the ovum. Hence also there is in this seminal matter 
an endeavor, and as it were a burning desire, to put itself off and leave the semen to perform its use. Something similar showed itself in this spirit. He came again to me, but in mean clothing, 
and again said that he was burning to come into heaven, and that he now perceived that he was fit for it; but I was given to tell him that perhaps this was an indication that he would soon be received. 
He was then told by the angels to cast off his garment, and in his longing he cast it off so quickly that scarcely anything could be quicker. By this was represented the nature of the ardent desires 
of those who are in the province to which the seminal vesicles correspond. </p>

A certain spirit from another planet was once present with me. (He belonged to the planet Jupiter.) He asked me earnestly to intercede on his behalf to enable him to enter heaven. He said he was not 
aware of having done what was evil, only of having reprimanded inhabitants of that planet. He added that after he reprimanded people he instructed them. He placed himself on my left side below my elbow; 
and as he spoke his voice seemed to crack. He also had the ability to arouse feelings of pity. The only answer I could give him however was that I was unable to help him in any way. Entrance into heaven, 
I told him, rested with the Lord alone. Nor could I intercede, since I did not know whether it would be useful or not; but if he was worthy he could entertain the hope of gaining it. At that point 
he was sent back to be among upright spirits who belonged to his own planet; but those spirits said that he could not remain in their company because he was not like them. Nevertheless because his 
intense desire made him demand that he should be let into heaven, he was sent to a community of upright spirits belonging to our own planet. But these too told him that he could not remain with them. 
In addition to this his colour seen in the light of heaven was black, though he himself said it was not black but a ruddy brown. </p>

 I was told that this is what people of this sort are like initially, 
before they are received among those who constitute the province of the seminal vesicles. For in these vesicles sperm (semen) is gathered together, where it is clothed with a suitable substance 
which is just right to preserve it from being dissipated and which can be shed at the cervix, so that the sperm stored inside may serve to bring about conception, that is, impregnation of the ovum. Therefore 
also that seminal substance holds within it the endeavour and so to speak burning desire to shed itself and leave the sperm to fulfill its purpose. Something similar was seen to happen to that 
spirit. He returned to me, but now he was dressed in humble clothing. He again said he had a burning desire to enter heaven and now recognized that he was in a fit state to remain there. But I was led 
to say to him that this was perhaps a sign that he would be received there shortly. At this point angels told him to cast aside his clothing, which in his desire to do so he cast aside so quickly that 
hardly anything could have been done more quickly. This represented the nature of the desires of those in the province to which the seminal vesicles correspond. </p>

Quidam spiritus ex alia tellure apud me fuit (erat ex tellure Jovis), is sollicite petiit ut intercederem pro eo ut venire posset in caelum; dicebat quod non sciat quod malum egerit, solum quod increpaverit 
incolas illius telluris; adjecit quod postquam increpavit, illos instruxerit; {1}applicuit se ad latas meum sinistrum sub ulna, et loquebatur {2} quasi bifide; is etiam potuit miserationem movere; 
sed non aliud potui {3} respondere quam quod nihil opis ferre possim, et quod id unice Domini sit, nec intercedere, quia non scio num utile vel non, {4}at si dignus quod posset sperare; {5} tunc 
remissus est inter spiritus probos qui ex sua tellure; {6}sed ii dicebant quod non posset esse in eorum consortio quia non talis; at quia usque ex intenso desiderio flagitabat ut intromitteretur in caelum, 
missus est in societatem proborum spirituum hujus telluris; verum etiam hi dicebant quod cum illis non esse possit; erat etiam nigri coloris in luce caeli, verum dixit ipse quod non esset coloris 
nigri sed murrhini. 	[2] {7}Dicebatur mihi quod tales sint principio qui dein recipiuntur inter illos qui constituunt provinciam vesicularum seminalium; in vesiculis enim illis colligitur semen, ac 
{8}circuminduitur materia conveniente, apta ad conservandum ne dissipetur, et quae exui potest in cervice uteri, ut sic, quod intus reservatum est, inservint conceptioni, hoc est, (x)impraegnationi 
ovuli; inde quoque seminali illi materiae est conatus et quasi flagrans desiderium se (x)exuendi, et relinquendi semen ut praestet usum; simile quid etiam apparuit apud illum spiritum; is venit adhuc 
ad me, sed in vestitu vili, et dicebat iterum quod arderet venire in caelum, et quod nunc apperciperet se talem esse; at dicere ei dabatur quod forte id indicium sit quod brevi recipiatur; dicebatur tunc 
ei ab angelis ut rejiceret vestem, is ex desiderio tam cito illam rejiciebat ut vix aliquid citius; per quod repraesentabatur qualia illorum desideria sunt qui in provincia cui vesiculae seminales 
correspondent. @1 applicabat$  @2 i tunc$  @3 i ei$  @4 et$  @5 i sed$  @6 at hi$  @7 mihi dictum$  @8 induitur$  </p>
