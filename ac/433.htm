<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第433节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>433.</strong>“若杀该隐，遭报七倍”表严禁侵犯“该隐”所象征的分离之信，如本章15节所示，“七十个七倍”表更加神圣不可侵犯，其后果就是罚入地狱，这一点从“七十个七倍”的含义明显可知。“七”是一个神圣的数字，这一点源于以下事实，即“第七日”表属天之人，属天的教会，属天的国度，在至高义上，表主自己。因此，在圣言中，凡出现数字“七”时，皆表神圣之物或最神圣的。这种神圣与圣洁就是所探讨事物的属性或取决于该事物。包含七个时代的数字“七十”的含义由此而来，因为在圣言中，一个时代就是十年。当表述最神圣或最圣洁的东西时，就说“七十个七倍”，如主说，当饶恕弟兄不是到七次，乃是到七十个七次（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太18.21.htm">18:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太18.22.htm">22</a>），以此表示饶恕他每一次的犯罪，以至于饶恕没有止境或是永远的，这就是神圣。此处，“杀拉麦，必遭报七十个七倍”表罚入地狱，因为侵犯了最神圣的东西。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]433.</strong> For the meaning of Cain will be avenged seven times as the placement of a sacred ban on violating the detached faith meant by Cain, see what was shown at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_433/bible_king-james-version_genesis_4_15" target=_top>15</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_433/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_392" target=_top>392-396</a>]. The symbolism of seventy-seven times as being far more sacrosanct and resulting in damnation can be seen from the symbolism of seventy-seven times.<br />Seven is a holy number because the seventh day symbolizes the heavenly person, the heavenly church, the heavenly kingdom, and in the highest sense the Lord himself. Therefore the number seven means something holy or sacrosanct wherever it occurs in the Word. The holiness or heinousness belongs to the qualities under discussion and is determined by them. Seventy is also holy because it covers seven "ages," an "age" in the Word being ten years.<br />When anything extremely holy or positively sacrosanct was expressed, the words seventy times seven times were used. The Lord, for instance, said that we should not forgive our brother or sister up to seven times but up to seventy times seven (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_433/bible_king-james-version_matthew_18_21-22" target=_top>Matthew 18:21-22</a>). This means that we should forgive as often as our brother or sister sins, without limit, or to eternity, which is holy. And the fact here that vengeance would be taken seventy-seven times means damnation, because violation was absolutely forbidden. </p>

That Cain's being "avenged sevenfold" signifies that it was sacrilege to do violence to that separated faith which is meant by "Cain" has been already shown at verse 15. And that by a "seventy and sevenfold 
avengement" is signified a far greater sacrilege the consequence of which is damnation, is evident from the signification of "seventy and sevenfold." That the number "seven" is holy, originates 
in the fact that the "seventh day" signifies the celestial man, the celestial church, the celestial kingdom, and, in the highest sense, the Lord Himself. Hence the number "seven" wherever it occurs 
in the Word, signifies what is holy, or most sacred; and this holiness and sanctity is predicated of, or according to, the things that are being treated of. From this comes the signification of the number 
"seventy" which comprises seven ages; for an age, in the Word, is ten years. When anything most holy or sacred was to be expressed, it was said "seventy-sevenfold" as when the Lord said that a man 
should forgive his brother not until seven times, but until seventy times seven (Matt. 18:22), by which is meant that they should forgive as many times as he sins, so that the forgiving should be without 
end, or should be eternal, which is holy. And here, that Lamech should "be avenged seventy and sevenfold" means damnation, because of the violation of that which is most sacred. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 433</b></p><p><b>433.</b>
'Cain's being avenged sevenfold' means that it was utterly forbidden to violate separated faith meant by Cain. See what has been shown at verse 15. 'Seventy-sevenfold' means that it was something even 
more inviolable on account of which condemnation follows the number seven is a holy number is that the seventh day means the celestial man, the celestial Church, the celestial kingdom, and in the highest 
sense the Lord Himself. Consequently whenever the number seven occurs in the Word it means that which is holy or utterly inviolable. And this holiness or inviolability has reference to, or else 
is determined by, the subject being dealt with. The same applies to the meaning of the number seventy consisting of seven ages (saecule),<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> for in the Word an age (saeculum) is a span of ten years. When 
anything extremely holy or utterly inviolable needed to be expressed people used the phrase 'seventy-sevenfold', as the Lord did, when He said that people were to forgive their brother not seven times 
but seventy times seven, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2018:21,%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 18:21, 22</a>. By this He meant that they were to forgive as often as he sinned. Their forgiveness was to know no limits, that is, was to be eternal and timeless, which is 
holy. In the present instance his being avenged seventy-sevenfold means condemnation, for it was utterly and completely forbidden to violate.

Quod 'septempliciter vindicari Cain' significet sacrosanctum esse violare fidem separatam per 'Cain' intellectam, videatur quod ostensum est ad vers. 15, et quod per 'septuagies et septies'  significetur 
quod multo magis sacrosanctum sit, et quod propterea damnatio, constare potest a significatione 'septuagies et septies.'  Quod septenarius numerus sit sanctus, inde est quod 'septimus die significet 
caelestem hominem, caelestem Ecclesiam, caeleste regnum in supremo sensu Ipsum Dominum; inde 'septenarius numerus' ubicumque occurrit in Verbo, significat sanctum seu sacrosanctum; et sanctum illud 
seu sacrosanctum praedicatur de iis aut secundum ea de quibus agitur; inde quoque numerus septuagenarius, qui septem saecula comprehendit, nam saeculum in Verbo est decem annorum quando aliquid maxime 
sanctum seu maxime sacrosanctum exprimeretur, tunc dicebatur 'septuagies septies,' sicut quod Domini dixit, 	Quod non remitterent fratri suo ad septies, sed usque ad septies septem, Matth. xviii 
21, 22; </p>
<p>per quod intelligitur quod toties remitterent quoties peccat, adeo ut sine fine esset, seu esset aeternum, quod est sanctum.  Et hic 'quod vindicaretur septuagies et septies' est damnatio quia 
maxime sacrosanctum erat violare. </p>
