<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3485节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3485.</strong>出现在来世中的代表都是表象，不过是活生生的表象，因为它们出自生命之光。生命之光就是唯独从主所接受的神圣智慧。因此，通过这光存在的一切事物，和通过尘世之光存在的一切事物不一样，它们是真实的。由于这个原因，在来世，人们有时会说，他们在那里看到的事物是真实的，而相比之下，世人所看到的事物反倒不真实。其原因在于，前者是活的，因而对他们的生命有直接影响；而后者不是活的，因而对他们的生命没有直接影响，除非他们头脑中属尘世之光的事物通过对应适当地与属天堂之光的事物相结合。由此明显可知何为代表，何为对应。</p>

The representations that come forth in the other life are appearances, but living ones, because they are from the light of life. The light of life is the Divine wisdom, which is from the Lord alone. 
Hence all things that come forth from this light are real; and are not like those things that come forth from the light of the world. Wherefore they who are in the other life have sometimes said that 
the things they see there are real things, and the things which man sees are in comparison not real; because the former things live, and thus immediately affect their life, while the latter things do 
not live, thus do not immediately affect the life, except insofar and in such a manner as the things in their minds which are of this world's light conjoin themselves fitly and correspondently with the 
things of the light of heaven. From all this it is now evident what representations are, and what correspondences. </p>

The representations that occur in the next life are appearances. But they are living representations because they come from the light of life. The light of life is Divine Wisdom, which is received from 
the Lord alone. Consequently all things that come into being from that light, unlike those from the light of the world, are real. For this reason people in the next life have said several times that 
the things they behold in that world are real, whereas those that man beholds are by contrast not real. The reason for this is that the former are living and so have a direct influence on their life, 
whereas the latter are not living and so have no direct influence on their life, except insofar as things with them belonging to the light of the world join themselves appropriately and by correspondence 
to those belonging to the light of heaven. From all these considerations it now becomes clear what representations are and what correspondences are. </p>

Repraesentationes quae in altera vita existunt, sunt apparentiae, sed vivae, quia a luce vitae sunt; lux vitae est Divina Sapientia, quae a solo Domino; inde omnia quae a luce illa existunt, sunt realia, 
non sicut illa quae a luce mundi; quapropter illi qui in altera vita sunt, aliquoties dixerunt quod quae ibi vident, sint realia, (c)et quae homo videt, respective non realia, quia illa vivunt et 
sic immediate afficiunt {1}vitam eorum, haec autem non vivunt, ita nec immediate afficiunt vitam, nisi qualiter et quantum apud eos illa quae lucis mundi sunt, se conjungunt adaequate et correspondenter 
cum illis quae lucis caeli sunt: inde nunc constare potest quid {2}repraesentationes et quid correspondentiae. @1 i ipsam$  @2 repraesentativa$  </p>
