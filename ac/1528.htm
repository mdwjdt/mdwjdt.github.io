<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1528节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1528.</strong>伴随恶欲及其乐趣的生命在恶灵当中显为煤火。主的爱与怜悯的生命流入他们后，就被转为这种火。其幻想的生命看似从它发出的光，这光是昏暗的，照不了多远。但是，当相爱的生命靠近时，燃烧的烈火就会熄灭，并转为寒冷，而那微弱之光则转为黑暗。因为恶灵就住在黑暗中，令人惊愕的是，有些恶灵甚至喜爱黑暗，憎恶光明。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1528.</strong> Sometimes, among evil spirits, a life devoted to the fulfillment of one's sensual desires resembles a coal fire. This semblance of fire is what the vitality of the Lord's love and mercy turns into when it flows into them. The vital energy of their hallucinations, on the other hand, looks like the light that comes from such a fire 钬?a dim light with no range whatever. When the living energy of mutual love approaches, the pseudo-fire is snuffed out and turns cold, while the weak light from it goes dark.<br />Evil spirits pass their lives in the dark. Astonishingly, some of them even love darkness and abominate light. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1528</b></p><p><b>1528.</b>
The life of cupidities and of the derivative pleasures sometimes appears among evil spirits like a coal fire. Into such a fieriness, as it were, is the life of the Lord's love and mercy changed that 
flows in with them; and the life of their phantasies appears as the light from it, which is a dim light that extends to no great distance; but at the approach of the life of mutual love, that fieriness 
is extinguished and turned into cold, and that dim light is turned into darkness. For evil spirits pass their lives in darkness; and, wonderful to say, some also love darkness, and hate light. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1528</b></p><p><b>1528.</b>
The life that goes with evil desires and resulting pleasures sometimes appears as a coal fire among evil spirits. The life of the Lord's love and mercy which flows into them is turned into this kind 
of fire The life of their delusions however looks like the glow from that fire - a glow that is dim and does not reach very far. But indeed when the life that stems from mutual love draws near, that burning 
is put out and converted into cold, while that dim light is converted into darkness. For evil spirits dwell in darkness, and what is astonishing, some even love darkness and detest the light. </p>

</p><b>1528.</b>
Vita cupiditatum et inde voluptatum apparet quandoque sicut ignis carbonarius apud spiritus malos; in tale quasi igneum vita amoris et misericordiae Domini quae apud eos influit, mutatur; vita autem 
phantasiarum eorum apparet sicut lumen inde, quod est obscurum ad nullam distantiam se extendens; at vero approximante vita amoris mutui, igneum illud exstinguitur et vertitur in frigus, et lumen illud 
obscurum vertitur in tenebras: nam mali spiritus degunt in tenebris, et mirum, quod etiam quidam ament tenebras et exosi sint lucem. </p>
