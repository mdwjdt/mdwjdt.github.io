<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3101节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3101.</strong>“要晓得耶和华赐他通达的道路没有”表关于神圣真理（的询问），即它是哪一类。这从“道路”的含义清楚可知，“道路”是指真理（参看<a href="627.htm">627</a>，<a href="2333.htm">2333</a>节）。那真理的性质是否是神性，由“耶和华赐通达的道路没有”来表示，这等于询问它是否来自耶和华，即来自神性。因此，所表示的是哪类真理。因为从属世人中被召唤出来进入理性人的真理不全都被接受；只有那些与理性人中的良善一致，并通过以这种方式被播种和植入而与那良善行如一体的真理才被接受。而剩下的，即便被提升之前它们看似真理，仍不被接受，因为它们得不到承认。良善承认自己的真理，真理承认自己的良善。从下文还明显可知，真理就是对它是哪一类的承认，这真理因此被接受。</p>

To know whether Jehovah had prospered his way or not. That this signifies inquiry concerning Divine truth, what it was, is evident from the signification of a "way," as being truth (see n. 627, 2333); 
whether it was Divine is signified by its being said "whether Jehovah had prospered it," which is the same as inquiring whether it was from Jehovah, or from the Divine, and thus what truth it was; for 
truths which are called forth from the natural man into the rational are not all received; but only those which agree with the good there, and thus by insemination and insertion act as one with it; 
the rest, although they had appeared as truths before they were elevated, still are not received, because they are not acknowledged. It is good that acknowledges its own truth, and it is truth that acknowledges 
its own good. That the truth was acknowledged for what it was, and that thus it was received, is also clear from what now follows. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3101</b></p><p><b>3101.</b>
'So as to know whether Jehovah had prospered his way or not' means regarding Divine Truth, as to what sort it was. This is clear from the meaning of 'way' as truth, dealt with in <a href="627.htm">627</a>, <a href="2333.htm">2333</a>. The Divine 
nature of that truth is meant by the words 'whether Jehovah had prospered' which amounts to the same as, whether it was from Jehovah, that is, from the Divine. Accordingly what sort of truth is meant, 
for the truths that are summoned from the natural man into the rational man are not all received, only those that accord with the good there, and on being sown and implanted in this way act as one 
with that good. The rest, even though they may have appeared as truths prior to being raised up, are nevertheless not received because they are not acknowledged. Good is that which acknowledges its own 
truth, and truth that which acknowledges its own good. That it was an acknowledgement of what sort of truth it was, and that thus this truth was received, is also evident from what follows next. </p>

</p><b>3101.</b>
`Ad sciendum, an prosperavisset Jehovah viam suam, vel non': quod significet de Divino Vero quodnam, constat a significatione `viae' quod sit verum, de qua n. 627, 2333; quod Divinum, significatur per 
id quod dicatur, `an prosperavisset Jehovah,' quod idem est, num ex Jehovah seu ex Divino; ita quodnam verum, nam vera quae e naturali homine evocantur in rationalem, non omnia recipiuntur, solummodo 
illa quae cum bono ibi concordant, ac sic per inseminationem et insertionem unum cum eo agunt; reliqua, tametsi ut vera apparuerint antequam elevata sunt, usque non recipiantur, quia non agnoscuntur; 
bonum est quod agnoscit suum verum, et verum est quod agnoscit suum bonum: quod agnitum quodnam verum ac sic receptum, patet quoque ab illis quae nunc sequuntur. </p>
