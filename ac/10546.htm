<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10546节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10546</strong>.“为自己支搭在营外，离营却远”表远离这个民族本身感兴趣的外在事物。这从“支搭帐棚”和“营”的含义清楚可知。“支搭帐棚”是指提供并有序地安排、布置属于教会和敬拜的事物，因为“帐棚”表示教会、敬拜和圣言的神圣之物，如刚才所述（<a href="10545.htm">10545</a>节）；因此，“支搭帐棚”表示提供并有序安排、布置这些事物。“营”是指天堂和教会产生并遵循的天堂秩序。由于天堂和教会的一切真理和良善都是该秩序的元素，故也表示包含它们的东西。“营”之所以表示这些事物，是因为形成营的“以色列人”表示整体上的一切真理和良善。但当以色列人敬拜牛犊而不是耶和华时，他们的“营”就有了反面意义，即表示地狱的秩序，以及包含构成地狱的虚假和邪恶的东西。无论你说没有任何内在之物的敬拜和教会的外在事物，还是说地狱，都是一回事；因为敬拜是外在而非内在的人都陷入自我之爱和尘世之爱，而自我之爱和尘世之爱来自地狱。由此明显可知为何摩西拿起帐棚，把它支搭在营外，离营却远，因为“帐棚”表示敬拜、教会和圣言的神圣，如前所述；又为何这些话表示远离以色列民族感兴趣的外在事物。<br />“营”表示天堂的秩序，“安营或扎营”表示按照天堂的秩序排列良善和真理（参看<a href="4236.htm">4236</a>，<a href="8103.htm">8103</a>e，<a href="8130.htm">8130</a>，<a href="8131.htm">8131</a>，<a href="8155.htm">8155</a>，<a href="8193.htm">8193</a>，<a href="8196.htm">8196</a>节）；因此，“营”表示天堂和教会，因为它们包含良善和真理（<a href="10038.htm">10038</a>节），在反面意义上则表示地狱（<a href="10458.htm">10458</a>节）；此外，与内在之物分离的敬拜和教会的外在构成地狱（参看<a href="10483.htm">10483</a>，<a href="10489.htm">10489</a>节）；因为那些兴趣在于与内在之物分离的外在事物之人根本不接受任何神性流注（<a href="10429.htm">10429</a>，<a href="10472.htm">10472</a>节），因而不能拥有任何对主之信或对主之爱（<a href="10396.htm">10396</a>，<a href="10400.htm">10400</a>，<a href="10411.htm">10411</a>节）；他们只看向自己的爱，因而看向地狱（<a href="10422.htm">10422</a>节），从而拜自己为神（<a href="10407.htm">10407</a>，<a href="10412.htm">10412</a>节）；以色列民族兴趣在于与内在之物分离的外在事物（参看<a href="9380.htm">9380</a>节提到的地方，以及<a href="9373.htm">9373</a>，<a href="9391.htm">9391</a>，<a href="10396.htm">10396</a>，<a href="10401.htm">10401</a>，<a href="10407.htm">10407</a>，<a href="10492.htm">10492</a>，<a href="10498.htm">10498</a>，<a href="10500.htm">10500</a>，<a href="10533.htm">10533</a>节的说明）。</p>

And stretched it for himself without the camp, afar off from the camp. That this signifies remote from the external things in which the nation itself was, is evident from the signification of "stretching 
the tent," as being to provide, dispose, and set in order the things which are of the church and of worship; for by the "tent" is signified what is holy of the church, of worship, and of the Word 
(see just above, n. 10545), consequently by "stretching it" is signified to provide, dispose, and set in order these things; and from the signification of "the camp," as being the heavenly order from 
which and according to which are heaven and the church; and as all the truths and goods of heaven and of the church belong to this order, there is consequently signified their containant also. The reason 
why these things are signified by "the camp," is that by "the sons of Israel," who formed the camp, are signified all truths and goods in the complex. But when the sons of Israel worshiped the calf 
instead of Jehovah, then by their "camp" was signified the opposite, thus infernal order, and also the containant of falsity and evil, which make hell. Whether you say "the external of worship and 
of the church without the internal," or "hell," it is the same thing; for they who are in the external of worship without the internal are in the loves of self and of the world, and the loves of self 
and of the world are from hell. From this it is evident why Moses took his tent and stretched it without the camp afar off from the camp; for as before said, by the "tent" was signified what is holy of 
worship, of the church, and of the Word; and also why by these words is signified what is remote from the external things in which the Israelitish nation was.  [2] (That by "the camp" is signified 
heavenly order, and by "encamping" the disposing of good and truth according to heavenly order, see n. 4236, 8103, 8130, 8131, 8155, 8193, 8196; and that consequently by "the camp" is signified heaven 
and the church insofar as they are the containant of these, n. 10038; and in the opposite sense hell, n. 10458; moreover, that the external of worship and of the church separate from what is internal 
is hell, see n. 10483, 10489; for the reason that those who are in external things separate from what is internal never receive any Divine influx, n. 10429, 10472; and consequently have nothing of faith 
in and of love to the Lord, n. 10396, 10400, 10411; because they look solely to their own loves, thus to hell, n. 10422; and consequently worship themselves for a god, n. 10407, 10412; that the Israelitish 
nation was in external things separate from what is internal, may be seen at the places cited in n. 9380, and also in n. 9373, 9391, 10396, 10401, 10407, 10492, 10498, 10500, 10533.) </p>

'And pitched it for himself outside the camp, far from the camp' means remote from the external things in which the interest of that actual nation lay. This is clear from the meaning of 'pitching the 
tent' as providing, arranging, and setting in order the things that belong to the Church and worship, for 'the tent' means the holiness of the Church, worship, and the Word, dealt with immediately above 
in <a href="10545.htm">10545</a>, so that 'pitching it' means providing, arranging, and setting those things in order; and from the meaning of 'the camp' as the heavenly order which heaven and the Church arise from and conform 
to. And since all the truths and forms of good of heaven and the Church are elements of that order, that which contains them is also meant. The reason why these elements are meant by 'the camp' 
is that by 'the children of Israel' who made up the camp all truths and forms of good in their entirety are meant. But when the children of Israel worshipped the calf instead of Jehovah their camp had 
a contrary meaning, namely hellish order and also that which contains the falsity and evil that compose hell. Whether you speak of the external things of worship and the Church without anything internal 
or you speak of hell, it amounts to the same thing; for people whose worship is external and not at all internal are ruled by self-love and love of the world, and self-love and love of the world 
come from hell. From this it is evident why 'Moses took his tent and pitched it outside the camp, far from the camp' - for 'the tent', as has been stated above, meant the holiness of worship, the Church, 
and the Word - and why those words mean remote from the external things in which the interest of the Israelite nation lay.  </p>
<p>'The camp' means heavenly order, and 'encamping' means arranging good 
and truth into heavenly order, see <a href="4236.htm">4236</a>, <a href="8103.htm">8103</a>(end), <a href="8130.htm">8130</a>, <a href="8131.htm">8131</a>, <a href="8155.htm">8155</a>, <a href="8193.htm">8193</a>, <a href="8196.htm">8196</a>.  </p>

 Consequently 'the camp' means heaven and the Church, in that they contain that good and truth, <a href="10038.htm">10038</a>, and in 
the contrary sense hell, <a href="10458.htm">10458</a>.  Also, the external side of worship and of the Church separated from the internal constitutes hell, <a href="10483.htm">10483</a>, <a href="10489.htm">10489</a>, because people whose interest lies in external things 
separated from what is internal never receive any Divine influx at all, <a href="10429.htm">10429</a>, <a href="10472.htm">10472</a>, and are therefore incapable of possessing any faith in the Lord or love to Him, <a href="10396.htm">10396</a>, <a href="10400.htm">10400</a>, <a href="10411.htm">10411</a>.  They look 
solely in the direction of their own loves, thus in the direction of hell, <a href="10422.htm">10422</a>, and consequently worship self as their god, <a href="10407.htm">10407</a>, <a href="10412.htm">10412</a>.  The interest of the Israelite nation lay in external things 
separated from what was internal, see in the places referred to in <a href="9380.htm">9380</a>, and also what is said in <a href="9373.htm">9373</a>, <a href="9381.htm">9381</a>, <a href="10396.htm">10396</a>, <a href="10401.htm">10401</a>, <a href="10407.htm">10407</a>, <a href="10492.htm">10492</a>, <a href="10498.htm">10498</a>, <a href="10500.htm">10500</a>, <a href="10533.htm">10533</a>.  </p>

`Et tetendit sibi extra castra, elongando a castris':  quod significet remotum ab externis in quibus ipsa gens, constat ex significatione `tendere tentorium' quod sit providere, disponere, et ordinare 
illa quae Ecclesiae et cultus sunt, per `tentorium' enim significatur sanctum Ecclesiae, cultus, et Verbi, de quo mox supra n. 10545, inde per `tendere illud' significatur providere, disponere, et 
ordinare illa; et ex significatione `castrorum' quod sint ordo caelestis, {1}ex quo et secundum quem est caelum et Ecclesia'; et quia omnia vera et bona caeli et Ecclesiae sunt ordinis illius, inde etiam 
significatur continens illorum; quod haec per `castra' significentur, est quia per `filios Israelis,' qui formabant castra, significantur omnia vera et bona in complexu; at cum filii Israelis colebant 
vitulum pro Jehovah, tunc per `castra' eorum significabatur contrarium, ita ordo infernalis, et quoque continens falsi et mali quae faciunt infernum; sive dicas externum cultus et Ecclesiae absque 
interno, sive infernum, idem est, nam qui in externo cultus sunt absque interno, in amoribus sui et mundi sunt, et amores sui et mundi ex inferno sunt; inde patet cur Moscheh accepit tentorium suum, 
et tetendit illud extra castra, elongando a castris, nam per `tentorium,' ut supra dictum est, significabatur sanctum cultus, Ecclesiae, et Verbi {2}, et cur per illa verba significatur remotum ab externis 
in quibus gens Israelitica erat. 	[2] Quod per `castra' significetur ordo caelestis, et per `castrametationem' dispositio boni et veri secundum ordinem caelestem, videatur n. 4236, 8103 fin.,
