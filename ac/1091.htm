<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1091节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1091.</strong>“知道他小儿子向他所作的事”表脱离内在敬拜的外在敬拜就是诸如嘲讽之类的。从字义或历史意义看，“小儿子”似乎是指含，但接下来的经文明显可知，“小儿子”是指迦南，因为经上说“迦南当受咒诅”，紧接着经上说迦南必“作奴隶的奴隶”（9:26-27）。接下来的这一节解释了为何只字未提含的原因。我们在此仅提一下为何顺序是这样的，即闪被命定是第一，含是第二，雅弗是第三，迦南是第四。闪所指的仁爱是教会的第一要素；含所指的信是第二要素；雅弗所指的出于仁爱的敬拜是第三要素；而迦南所指的缺乏信与仁的外在敬拜是第四要素。仁是信的兄弟，因此也是出于仁爱的敬拜；而缺乏仁爱的外在敬拜则是“奴隶的奴隶”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1091.</strong> What his younger son had done to him means that external worship cut off from internal worship is by nature contemptuous. In the literal meaning — the narrative — his younger son seems to mean Ham, but the next verse indicates that it means Canaan, because it says, "A curse on Canaan!" And the subsequent verses (26, 27) say that Canaan will be a slave. For the reason why Ham goes unmentioned, see what is said at the next verse [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1091/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1093#subsection-2-3" target=_top>1093:3</a>].<br />The only thing left to explain here is the reason for an arrangement that lists Shem first, Ham second, Japheth third, and Canaan fourth. Charity (Shem) is the first step of religion, faith (Ham) is the second, worship growing out of charity (Japheth) is the third, and an outward show of worship devoid of faith and charity (Canaan) is the fourth.<br />Charity is the brother of faith, and so too the worship that grows out of charity; but a show of worship without any base in charity is a slave of slaves. </p>

What his younger son had done unto him. This signifies that external worship separate from internal is such that it derides. From the literal or historic sense it appears as if Ham were meant by his 
younger son, but from the following verse it is evident that Canaan is meant, for it is said, "Cursed be Canaan" and in the subsequent verses (26 and 27), it is said that Canaan should be a servant. The 
reason nothing is said of Ham will be explained under the next verse. Here we shall merely mention why the order is such that Shem is named first, Ham second, Japheth third, and Canaan fourth. Charity 
is the first of the church, or Shem; faith is the second, or Ham; worship from charity is the third, or Japheth; worship in externals without faith and charity is the fourth, or Canaan. Charity is 
the brother of faith, and therefore so also is worship from charity; but worship in externals without charity is "a servant of servants." </p>

'What his younger son had done to him' means that external worship separated from internal is such as mocks. From the sense of the letter, which is the historical sense, 'younger son' seems to mean Ham, 
but from the verse following it is clear that Canaan is meant, for the phrase 'Cursed be Canaan' is used. And in the subsequent verses 26, 27, it is said that 'Canaan will be a slave'. The reason 
why nothing is mentioned concerning Ham may be seen in the following verse. All that need be mentioned here is why Shem is named first, Ham second, Japheth third, and Canaan fourth. Charity, meant by 
Shem, is the first thing of the Church; faith, meant by Ham, is the second; worship arising from charity, meant by Japheth, is the third; and worship in external things devoid of faith and charity, meant 
by Canaan, is the fourth. Charity is the brother of faith, and so too is worship arising from charity. But worship in external things devoid of charity is 'a slave of slaves'. </p>

</p><b>1091.</b>
Quod 'fecit ei filius minor' significet quod talis sit cultus externus separatus ab interno ut irrideat: ex sensu litterae seu historico apparet sicut per filium minorem intelligatur Ham sed ex sequenti 
versu constat quod intelligatur Canaan, nam dicitur 'maledictus Canaan'; etiam in versu subsequente, 26 et 27, quod 'Canaan erit servus'; et quod nihil de Hamo memoretur, causa in sequente versu 
videatur.  Hic modo memorandum, cur ordo talis sit quod primo loco nominetur Shem, secundo Ham, tertio Japheth, et quarto Canaan: charitas est primum Ecclesiae seu 'Shem'; fides est secundum seu 'Ham'; 
cultus ex charitate est tertium seu 'Japheth'; cultus in externis absque fide et charitate est quartum seu 'Canaan': charitas est 'frater' fidei, inde quoque cultus ex charitate, sed cultus in externis 
absque charitate est 'servus servorum.' </p>
