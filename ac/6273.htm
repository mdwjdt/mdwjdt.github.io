<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6273节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6273.</strong>“玛拿西原是长子”表因为良善的确占据第一位。这从“玛拿西”的代表和“长子名分”的含义清楚可知：“玛拿西”是指属于意愿的良善，如前所述；“长子名分”是指在先和更高位置（参看<a href="3325.htm">3325</a>节），因此，“长子”是指占据第一位的人。只要更高级的光稍微光照属世之光，谁不能仅凭这属世之光看出，良善占据第一位，就像人的意愿占据第一位一样；而真理占据第二位，就像人的思维占据第二位一样？谁还看不出，人的意愿使他以这种方式，而非另一种方式思考，因此，他所拥有的良善使他思考这个或那个是真的；因而那真理占据第二位，良善占据第一位？请思考并反思一下构成信仰的真理除了扎根于良善外，是否能扎根在别处；或信仰若不是扎根在那里，是否还是信仰。由此你就能得出以下结论：对教会，或有教会在里面的人来说，首要或本质的要素是什么。</p>

For Manasseh was the firstborn. That this signifies since indeed good is in the prior place, is evident from the representation of Manasseh, as being the good that is of the will (of which above); and 
from the signification of "birthright," as being priority and superiority (see n. 3325), thus the "firstborn" is one who is in the prior place. Who cannot see from natural light alone, provided it is 
enlightened a little, that good is in the prior place, as is also man's will; and that truth is in the posterior place, as is also man's thinking? And also that man's will causes him to think one way 
and not another, consequently that the good with a man causes this or that to be true; thus that truth is in the second place, and good in the first? Think and reflect whether the truth that is of faith 
can take root except in good, and whether faith is faith unless it is therein rooted. Hence you may conclude what is primary or essential to the church, that is, to the man in whom the church is. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6273</b></p><p><b>6273.</b>
'For Manasseh was the firstborn' means since good does indeed occupy the first place. This is clear from the representation of 'Manasseh' as good belonging to the will, dealt with before; and from the 
meaning of 'the birthright' as the prior and higher position, dealt with in <a href="3325.htm">3325</a>, so that 'the firstborn' is the one who occupies the first place. Is anyone incapable of seeing from natural light alone, 
provided a superior light brightens it a little, that good occupies the first place, as also do the intentions in a person's will, and that truth occupies the second, as also do the thoughts in his 
mind? Is anyone also incapable of seeing that the intentions in a person's will cause him to think in one particular way and no other, consequently that the good he possesses causes him to think that 
this or that is true; so that truth occupies the second place and good the first? Think and reflect on whether truth that composes faith can take root anywhere else than in good, or whether faith other 
than that which has taken root there is faith. From this you will be able to decide which is the primary or essential element for the Church, that is, for the person in whom the Church exists. </p>

</p><b>6273.</b>
`Quia Menasheh primogenitus': quod significet siquidem bonum est priore loco, constat ex repraesentatione `Menashis' quod sit bonum quod voluntarii, de qua prius; et ex significatione `primogeniturae' 
quod sit prioritas et superioritas, de qua n. 3325, ita `primogenitus' est qui in priore loco.  Quod bonum sit priore loco, ut quoque velle hominis, et quod verum sit posteriore, ut quoque cogitare 
hominis, quis non hoc potest ex solo naturali lumine modo paululum illustrato videre? tum quod velle hominis faciat ut ita non aliter cogitet, consequenter quod bonum apud hominem faciat ut cogitet quod 
hoc aut illud (t)sit verum, sic quod verum secundo loco sit, et bonum primo? cogita et reflecte num radicari {1}queat verum quod fidei nisi in bono, et num fides nisi ibi radicata sit fides; inde 
concludere poteris quid est primarium aut essentiale Ecclesiae, hoc est, homini in quo Ecclesia. @1 possit$ </p>
