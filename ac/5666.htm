<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5666.</strong>创世记43:24-28.那人就领这些人进约瑟的屋里，给他们水洗脚，又给他们的驴饲料。他们就预备那礼物，等候约瑟晌午来，因为他们听见他们要在那里吃饭。约瑟来到家里，他们就把手中的礼物拿进屋去给他，又俯伏在地，向他下拜。约瑟问他们安，又说，你们的父亲就是你们所说的那老人家平安吗？他还活着吗？他们说，你仆人我们的父亲平安。他还活着。于是他们俯伏下拜。<br />“那人就领这些人进约瑟的屋里”表与内在联结的引入阶段。“给水”表来自内在的真理的总体流注。“他们洗脚”表随之属世层的洁净。“又给他们的驴饲料”表关于良善的教导。“他们就预备那礼物”表灌输。“等候约瑟晌午来”表直等内在与光明一同出现。“因为他们听见他们要在那里吃饭”表对良善要与真理联结的洞察。”约瑟来到家里”表内在的出现。“他们就把手中的礼物拿进屋去给他”表尽可能地灌输。“又俯伏在地，向他下拜”表谦卑。“约瑟问他们安”表对一切安好的觉知。“又说，你们的父亲就是你们所说的那老人家平安吗”表也同属灵良善一道。“他还活着吗”表这良善有生命。“他们说，你仆人我们的父亲平安”表属世层从那里所获得的对于它所源于的良善一切安好的觉知。“他还活着”表它有生命。“于是他们俯伏下拜”表外在和内在的谦卑。</p>

Verses 24-28. And the man brought the men to Joseph's house, and gave waters, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender. And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon; 
for they heard that they should eat bread there. And Joseph came to the house, and they brought him the present which was in their hand to the house, and bowed down themselves to him to the earth. 
And he asked them to peace, and said, Is there peace to your father, the old man of whom ye spoke? Is he yet alive? And they said, There is peace to thy servant our father; he is yet alive. And they bent 
themselves and bowed themselves down. "And the man brought the men to Joseph's house," signifies initiation to conjunction with the internal; "and gave waters," signifies a general influx of truth 
from the internal; "and they washed their feet," signifies a consequent purifying of the natural; "and he gave their asses provender," signifies instruction concerning good; "and they made ready the 
present," signifies instilling; "against Joseph came at noon," signifies until the internal should be present with light; "for they heard that they should eat bread there," signifies a noticing that good 
would be adjoined to truths; "and Joseph came to the house," signifies the presence of the internal; "and they brought him the present which was in their hand to the house," signifies instilling as 
far as possible; "and bowed down themselves to him to the earth," signifies humiliation; "and he asked them to peace," signifies perception that it is well; "and said, Is there peace to your father, 
the old man of whom ye spoke," signifies also with spiritual good; "is he yet alive," signifies that it has life; "and they said, There is peace to thy servant our father," signifies a noticing therefrom 
of the natural that it is well with the good from which it comes; "he is yet alive," signifies and that it has life; "and they bent themselves and bowed themselves down," signifies outward and inward 
humiliation. </p>

Verses 24-28 And the man brought the men to Joseph's house and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave fodder to their asses. And they made ready the gift, until Joseph's coming at midday, 
for they heard that they would eat bread there. And Joseph came to the house, and they brought him the gift that was in their hand, to the house, and bowed down to him to the earth. And he questioned 
them about their peace,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and said, Does your father, the old man of whom you spoke, have peace? Is he still alive? And they said, Your servant our father has peace; he is still alive. And they 
bowed, and bowed down. </p>
<p>'And the man brought the men to Joseph's house' means an introductory stage to the joining to the internal. 'And gave them water' means a general influx of truth from the internal. 
'And they washed their feet' means a consequent purification of the natural. 'And he gave fodder to their asses' means instruction regarding good. 'And they made ready the gift' means an instillation. 
'Until Joseph's coming at midday' means up to when the internal would be present with light. 'For they heard that they would eat bread there' means a discernment that good was to be linked to 
the truths. 'And Joseph came to the house' means the presence of the internal. 'And they brought him the gift that was in their hand, to the house' means an instillation as far as this was possible. 'And 
bowed down to the earth' means an expression of humility. 'And he questioned them about their peace' means a perception that all is well. 'And he said, Does your father, the old man of whom you spoke, 
have peace?' means with spiritual good too. 'Is he still alive?' means that this has life. 'And they said, Your servant our father has peace' means a perception gained from there by the natural that 
all is well with the good from which it springs. 'He is still alive means and that it has life. 'And they bowed, and bowed down' means an expression of humility, exterior and interior.
