<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4530节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4530.</strong>在来世，我们也会看到各种颜色，其灿烂、辉煌远远超过世上颜色的光泽，以至于几乎没有任何可比性。这些颜色是由那里光与暗的变化而产生的；由于那里所存在的出自主的聪明和智慧，在天使和灵人眼前显为光，同时从内在光照他们的理解力，故就其本质而言，这些颜色就是聪明和智慧的变化，或可以说是聪明和智慧的修改。我几乎无数次看到那里的颜色，不仅包括装饰那些花的颜色，使得大气灿烂辉煌的颜色，产生各种彩虹的颜色，还包括那些以其它形式显现的颜色。它们的光辉源自属于聪明的真理，它们的灿烂源自属于智慧的良善，而这些颜色本身则是由其明与暗，因而由光明与阴影所产生的，和世上所产生的色彩一样。正因如此，在圣言中，经上所提到的颜色，如亚伦胸牌中和圣衣上的宝石的颜色；约柜所在会幕幔子的颜色；修饰新耶路撒冷根基的宝石的颜色（如启示录所描述的），以及别处提及的颜色，都代表诸如属于聪明和智慧之类的事物。至于这些颜色各自代表什么，蒙主的神性怜悯，等到解释这些经文时再予以说明。一般来说，来世所看到的颜色越包含光辉和洁白，就越出自聪明的真理；越拥有辉煌和紫红，就越出自智慧的良善。这些颜色来源于这些源头，也属于眼睛的区域。</p>

Colors also are seen in the other life which in splendor and refulgence surpass the luster of the colors of this world to such a degree that scarcely any comparison is possible. These colors are produced 
by the variegation of the light and shade there; and as it is the intelligence and wisdom that come from the Lord which there appear as light before the eyes of angels and spirits, and at the same 
time inwardly illumine their understandings, in their essence these colors are variations or so to speak modifications of intelligence and wisdom. The colors there--not only those with which the flowers 
are adorned, the atmospheres made brilliant, and the rainbows varied, but also those which are distinctly presented in other forms-have been seen by me an almost countless number of times. They have 
their brightness from the truth which is of intelligence, and their effulgence from the good which is of wisdom, and the colors themselves are produced from the whiteness and the darkness thereof, 
thus from light and shade, like the tints of color in this world. It is for this reason that the colors mentioned in the Word, such as those of the precious stones in Aaron's breast plate and upon his 
garments of holiness, and those of the curtains of the tent where the ark was, and those of the stones of the foundation of the New Jerusalem, described by John in Revelation, besides others mentioned 
elsewhere, represented such things as are of intelligence and wisdom. But what each of these colors represents shall of the Lord's Divine mercy be told in the explications. In general the colors seen 
in the other life have splendor and whiteness insofar as they come from the truth of intelligence; and they have refulgence and crimson insofar as they come from the good of wisdom. Those colors which 
derive their origin from these sources also belong to the provinces of the eyes. </p>

Colours are also seen in the next life whose splendour and brilliance so surpass the richness of the colours in the world that scarcely any comparison is possible. They are products of the variegation 
of light and shade there. And because intelligence and wisdom from the Lord exist there which are seen as light by the eyes of angels and spirits, and at the same time inwardly enlighten their understanding, 
the colours there are in essence variations, or one may say, modifications, of intelligence and wisdom. The colours there with which not only the flowers are adorned, different skies painted, 
and different rainbows produced, but also those which are manifested in other forms, I have seen so many times that I can hardly number them. Their splendour derives from the truth which belongs to 
intelligence, and their brilliance from the good which belongs to wisdom, while the colours themselves are products of the brightness and the dullness of these, and so are the products of light and shade, 
like the colourings produced in this world. Consequently the colours which are mentioned in the Word - such as those of the precious stones in Aaron's breastplate, and on his holy vestments; those 
in the curtains of the tent where the Ark was; those in the foundation-stones of the New Jerusalem which are described by John in the Book of Revelation; and those mentioned elsewhere in the Word - 
represented aspects of intelligence and wisdom, though what each represents individually will in the Lord's Divine mercy be stated in the explanations of those parts of the Word. In general to the extent 
that they contain splendour and derive from the shining brightness of light the colours there are products of the truth which belongs to intelligence, and to the extent they possess brilliance and 
derive from the purple glow of light they are products of the good which belongs to wisdom. Those colours which owe their origin to such sources also belong to the provinces of the eyes. </p>

Colores etiam visuntur in altera vita qui splendore et fulgore {1} excedunt in tantum nitorem colorum in mundo ut vix aliqua comparatio detur; sunt illi ex variegatione lucis et umbrae ibi; et quia 
ibi {2} est intelligentia et sapientia a Domino quae sicut lux apparet coram oculis angelorum et spirituum ac simul intus illuminat eorum intellectum, sunt colores ibi in sua essentia variationes, 
aut, ut ita dicatur {3}, modificationes intelligentiae (c)et sapientiae: colores ibi, non solum quibus decorantur flores, illustrantur atmosphaerae, et variantur irides, sed etiam qui in formis 
aliis discreti sistuntur, toties mihi visi sunt ut vices vix numerari possint; splendor illis est ex vero quod est intelligentiae, et fulgur ex bono quod est sapientiae, (c)et ipsi colores ex candido 
et obscuro {4} eorum; ita ex luce et umbra sicut colorationes in mundo.  [2] Inde est quod colores qui in Verbo memorantur, ut qui fuerunt lapidum pretiosorum in pectorali Aharonis, (c)ac super 
vestibus sanctitatis ejus; quique in aulaeis tentorii ubi Arca, et {5} qui in lapidibus fundamenti Novae Hierosolymae, de quibus apud Johannem in Apocalypsi, et alibi, repraesentaverint talia quae 
intelligentiae et sapientiae sunt: </p>
<p>quid autem singuli repraesentant {6}, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in explicationibus dicetur; in genere colores ibi quantum splendoris habent et ex candido trahunt, 
tantum ex vero quod est intelligentiae, et quantum fulguris habent et ex purpureo trahunt, tantum ex bono quod est sapientiae: illi qui inde ducunt originem, etiam ad oculorum provincias pertinent.
