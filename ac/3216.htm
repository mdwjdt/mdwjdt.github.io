<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3216节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3216.</strong>为更好地了解来世代表物的性质，也就是说，出现在灵人界的那些事物的性质，再举几个例子。当天使正在谈论仁与信的教义时，在相对应的灵人社群所在的较低领域有时会看到一座或数座城的形态或模型，城内有宫殿。这些宫殿的建筑设计如此巧妙，令人叹为观止，以至于你会说，这里就是建筑艺术的家乡、一切灵感所在之处，更不用说各种形状的房子了。说来奇妙，在每一座宫殿或每一间房子里面，甚至连最小的点或最细微的可见细节都无不代表天使观念和言谈的某个方面。由此清楚可知它们所包含的细节何等数不胜数，以及圣言中先知们所看到的城、圣城或新耶路撒冷、圣言的预言部分所提到的城是什么意思，也就是说，它们表示仁与信的教义（<a href="402.htm">402</a>，<a href="2449.htm">2449</a>） 。</p>

In order that it may be still better known how the case is with representatives in the other life, that is, with those things which appear in the world of spirits, take some further examples. When the 
angels are speaking about the doctrinal things of charity and faith, then sometimes in a lower sphere, where there is a corresponding society of spirits, there appears the form or pattern of a city 
or cities, with palaces therein exhibiting such skill in architecture as is amazing, so that you would say that the very art itself was there in its native home; not to mention houses of varied aspect; 
and wonderful to say in all these objects both in general and in particular there is not the smallest point, or visible atom, that does not represent something of the angelic idea and speech: so that 
it is evident what innumerable things are contained in these; and also what is signified by the cities seen by the prophets in the Word; and likewise what by the holy city or New Jerusalem; and what 
by the cities in the prophetic Word; namely, the doctrinal things of charity and faith (n. 402, 2449). </p>

So that an even better knowledge may be had of the nature of representatives in the next life, that is to say, of the things that are seen in the world of spirits, let several examples also be given. 
When with angels a discussion is taking place about matters of doctrine regarding charity and faith, there is sometimes seen in that lower sphere where the corresponding community of spirits is situated 
the visible idea of a city or of cities with palaces in them. The architecture of these is so astounding that you would say architectural art itself existed there and was the inspiration of everything 
there. In addition the houses there are of varying appearance. And the marvel of it is that in every single palace or house not even the smallest point or tiniest visible detail exists that does 
not represent some aspect of the idea and discussion among the angels. From this it becomes clear how countless the details are which they contain, and also what was meant in the Word by the cities seen 
by prophets - what is meant by the Holy City or New Jerusalem, and also by the cities mentioned in the prophetical part of the Word, namely matters of doctrine regarding charity and faith, <a href="402.htm">402</a>, <a href="2449.htm">2449</a>. </p>

Ut adhuc melius sciatur quomodo se habet cum repraesentativis in altera vita, nempe cum illis quae apparent in mundo spirituum, sint quoque hic aliquot exempla. Cum apud angelos sermo est de doctrinalibus 
charitatis et fidei, quandoque tunc in sphaera inferiore ubi est societas spirituum correspondens, apparet idea urbis seu urbium, cum palatiis inibi, tali arte architectonica ut stupendum, sic 
ut dicas ibi ac inde ipsam illam artem esse. praeter domos vario aspectu; et quod mirabile, in illis omnibus et singulis, non datur minimum punctum, aut minimum visibile, quod non aliquid ex idea ac sermone 
angelico repraesentat: exinde constare potest quam innumerabilia illi insunt; {1}tum quid significatum est per urbes visas prophetis in Verbo, ut quid per Civitatem Sanctam seu Novam Hierosolymam; 
{2}ut et quid per urbes in Verbo prophetico, quod nempe doctrinalia charitatis et fidei, n. (x)402, (x)2449. @1 et$  @2 et quoque$  </p>
