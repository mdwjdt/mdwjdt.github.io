<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第202节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>202.</strong>上古之人是属天之人，他们不仅不“吃分别善恶树”，亦即不通过感官和知识去了解信，甚至不触碰那树，亦即不通过感官和知识去思索信，免得从属天的生命落入属灵的生命，乃至不断堕落。属天的天使即是如此，其中更胜者甚至不提信，若他人提起信，他们将其领受为爱。当中的区别，只有他们自己明了。所以，凡有关于信的，他们皆觉知为爱。对信作推理，乃至将信知识化，他们就更加远离了。因为藉着爱，他们从主获得对良善与真理的觉知，凭此觉知，他们当下明了是与不是。<br />故此，当有人提说信，他们的回答就是简单的是或不是，因为他们从主拥有这份觉知。主说：“你们的话，是，就说是，不是，就说不是。若再多说，就是出于恶。”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.37.htm">5:37</a>）即是此义。<br />不可摸分别善恶树的果子，也正是此义。因为触碰它，就落入恶中，结果乃是“死”。不过，属天的天使也谈论各样的话题。他们交流的语言是发于爱的属天的语言，相比属灵的天使，其语言更加妙不可言。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]202.</strong> The earliest church, which was a heavenly person, was such that it did not eat from the tree of knowledge; it was not from sense impressions and facts that people learned what belongs to faith. In fact they were not allowed even to touch that tree; they were not allowed even to think about any matter of faith on the basis of sense impressions or facts. Had they done so, they would have slipped from a heavenly life into a spiritual life and lower.<br />Heavenly angels live this same way. Those who are more profoundly heavenly do not even allow faith to be mentioned, nor anything that has a spiritual [rather than heavenly] quality. (If others do mention faith, in its place they perceive love, in an altered form known to themselves alone; whatever has to do with faith they see as stemming from love and goodwill.) They have a still harder time listening to a logical treatment of faith, and least of all can they stand to hear a coldly factual treatment. This is because the Lord gives them a perception through love of what is good and true. From perception they recognize immediately whether a thing is so or not. Consequently when they hear any discussion of faith, they have no other response than "That's true" or "That's not true," because they perceive so from the Lord. Here lies the meaning of the Lord's words in Matthew:<br />Your conversation shall be "Yes, yes," "No, no." Anything beyond these comes from evil. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_202/bible_king-james-version_matthew_5_37" target=_top>Matthew 5:37</a>)<br />Such is the meaning of the prohibition on even touching the fruit of the tree of knowledge, since these humans would have fallen prey to evil if they had — which is to say they would have died from it.<br />Heavenly angels, by the way, discuss all kinds of things, just as others do, but their speech, being formed and derived from love, is heavenly. It is harder to describe than the speech of spiritual angels. </p>

The Most Ancient Church, which was a celestial man, was of such a character as not only to abstain from "eating of the tree of knowledge" that is, from learning what belongs to faith from sensuous things 
and memory-knowledges [scientifica], but was not even allowed to touch that tree, that is, to think of anything that is a matter of faith from sensuous things and memory-knowledges, lest they should 
sink down from celestial life into spiritual life, and so on downward. Such also is the life of the celestial angels, the more interiorly celestial of whom do not even suffer faith to be named, nor 
anything whatever that partakes of what is spiritual; and if it is spoken of by others, instead of faith they have a perception of love, with a difference known only to themselves; thus whatever is 
of faith they derive from love and charity. Still less can they endure listening to any reasoning about faith, and least of all to anything of memory-knowledge [scientificum] respecting it; for, through 
love, they have a perception from the Lord of what is good and true; and from this perception they know instantly whether a thing is so, or is not so. Therefore when anything is said about faith, they 
answer simply that it is so, or that it is not so, because they perceive it from the Lord. This is what is signified by the Lord's words in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Let your communication be Yea, yea; nay, 
nay; for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil (Matt. 5:37). This then is what was meant by their not being allowed to touch the fruit of the tree of knowledge; for if they touched it, they would 
be in evil, that is, they would in consequence "die." Nevertheless the celestial angels converse together on various subjects like the other angels, but in a celestial language, which is formed and 
derived from love, and is more ineffable than that of the spiritual angels. </p>

The Most Ancient Church, which was celestial man, was not only forbidden to eat from the tree of knowledge, that is, to learn that which comprised faith from sensory evidence and from facts; it was not 
even allowed 'to touch that tree', that is, even to think from sensory evidence and from facts about anything that was a matter of faith. This was to prevent them slumping from celestial to spiritual 
life, and in this way going down further still. The life of celestial angels is also the same. Those of them who are more interiorly celestial do not even allow faith to be mentioned or anything whatever 
which has a spiritual origin. If others mention it they perceive love instead of faith, with a difference known only to themselves. Thus anything that is a matter of faith they derive from love 
and charity. Still less do they allow themselves to listen to anything of a rational nature concerning faith, and least of all to anything of a factual nature; for they possess from the Lord by way of 
love a perception of what good and truth are. From perception they know instantly whether something is so or not so. Consequently when any statement about faith is made their response is either That 
is so, or That is not so, for they are perceiving from the Lord. This is what the Lord's words mean in Matthew,   Let your words be, YES, YES, NO, NO; anything beyond this is from evil.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%205:37&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 5:37</a>.  
 The present verse in Genesis says that they were not allowed even to touch the fruit of the tree of knowledge, for if they did touch it, they would be subject to evil, that is, they would consequently 
die. All the same, celestial angels, like others, discuss various matters among themselves, but they do so in celestial language that is formed by, and derived from, love, a language that is more 
indescribable than the language of spiritual angels.

Antiquissima Ecclesia, quae caelestis homo, talis erat ut non solum 'non comederet de arbore scientiae,' hoc est, disceret e sensualibus et scientificis quid fidei, sed ne quidem licebat eis 'tangere 
istam arborem,' hoc est, cogitare ex sensualibus et scientificis aliqui quod esset fidei, ne a vita caelesti in vitam spiritualem, et sic porro, delaberentur.  Talis quoque est vita angelorum caelestium; 
qui eorum intimus caelestes sunt, ne quidem admittunt ut nominetur fides aut quicquid aliquid a spirituali trahit; sique nominatur ab aliis, pro fide percipiunt amorem cum differentia iis solum 
cognita; ita quicquid est fidei, derivant ab amore et charitate; minus adhuc audire sustinent aliquid rationale et minime aliquid scientificum de fide; nam perceptionem habent a Domino per amorem quid 
bonum et verum; ex perceptione norunt ilico an ita sit vel non ita sit; quare cum de fide dicitur quid, non aliud respondent quam quod ita sit vel non ita sit, quia a Domino percipiunt: hoc est quod 
significant verba Domini apud Matthaeum, 	Erit sermo vester, Etiam etiam, Non non; quod ultra haec est, ex malo est, v 37; </p>
<p>hoc nunc est quod ne quidem tangere eis licuerit fructum arboris scientiae; 
nam si tangerent, in malo essent, seu inde morerentur. Praeterea, angeli caelestes inter se loquuntur sicut alii de variis, sed loquela caelesti, formata et derivata ex amore, quae ineffabilior est quam 
loquela angelorum spiritualium. </p>
