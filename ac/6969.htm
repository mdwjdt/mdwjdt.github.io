<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6969节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6969.</strong>出埃及记4:8，9.耶和华又说，将来他们若不信你，也不听前一个神迹的声音，他们必信后一个神迹的声音。将来他们若连这两个神迹也不信，也不听你的声音，你就从河里取些水，倒在旱地上，你从河里取的水必在旱地上变作血。<br />“将来他们若不信你”表他们若没有信。“也不听前一个神迹的声音”表他们若不遵从圣言所宣告的，就不是属灵和理性人，而是会变得不属灵、不理性。“他们必信后一个神迹的声音”表他们将信圣言所预先声明的，即他们将变成真理的亵渎者。“将来他们若连这两个神迹也不信”表他们若不信这类事会发生。“也不听你的声音”表他们若没有任何遵从的迹象。“你就从河里取些水”表含有虚假在里面的记忆知识，或虚假的记忆知识。“倒在旱地上”表将它注入属世层。“你从河里取的水”表状态的颠倒。“必在旱地上变作血”表对所有真理的歪曲，以及随之它在属世层中的匮乏。</p>

Verses 8, 9. And it shall be, if they do not believe thee, and hear not the voice of the former sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. And it shall be, if they do not believe also 
these two signs, and do not hear thy voice, that thou shalt take of the waters of the river, and pour out on the dry [land], and the waters which thou hast taken out of the river, they shall become blood 
in the dry [land]. "And it shall be, if they do not believe thee," signifies if they have not faith; "and hear not the voice of the former sign," signifies if they do not obey what is announced from 
the Word, that instead of spiritual and rational men they would become not spiritual and not rational; "that they will believe the voice of the latter sign," signifies that they would have faith in 
what had been foretold from the Word, namely, that they would become profaners of truth; "and it shall be, if they do not believe also these two signs," signifies if they should have no faith whatever 
that such things would come to pass; "and do not hear thy voice," signifies if they do not yield any obedience; "that thou shalt take of the waters of the river," signifies false memory-knowledges; 
"and pour out on the dry [land]," signifies insertion into the natural; "and the waters which thou hast taken out of the river," signifies inversion of the state; "they shall become blood in the dry 
[land]," signifies the falsification of all truth, and the consequent privation of it in the natural. </p>

Verses 8, 9 [And Jehovah said,] And so it will be, if they do not believe you and do not hear the voice of the former sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. And so it will be, if 
they do not believe even these two signs and do not hear your voice, that you are to take some of the water of the river and pour it out onto the dry land; and it will be water which you have taken from 
the river, and it will become blood on the dry land. </p>
<p>'And so it will be, if they do not believe you' means if they are not in possession of faith. 'And do not hear the voice of the former sign' 
means that if they did not obey what was declared by the Word, then instead of being spiritual and rational they would become people who were not  spiritual or rational. 'That they will believe the voice 
of the latter sign means that they would possess faith in what had been declared before-hand by the Word, that they would become profaners of truth. 'And so it will be, if they do not believe even 
these two signs' means if they possessed no faith at all that such things would come about. 'And do not hear your voice' means if they show no sign of obedience either. 'You are to take some of the 
water of the river' means factual knowledge that has falsities in it. 'And pour it out onto the dry land' means instilling it into the natural. 'And it will be water which you have taken' means an inversion 
of state. 'And it will become blood on the dry land' means the falsifying of all truth and a consequent deprivation of it in the natural. </p>

Vers. 8, 9.  Et erit, si non credunt tibi, et [non] audiunt vocem signi prioris, et credent voci signi posterioris.  Et erit, si non credunt etiam binis signis illis, et non audiunt vocem tuam, et accipias 
de aquis fluvii, et effundas in aridam, et erunt aquae quas accepisti e fluvio, et erunt in sanguinem in arida.  `Et erit, si non credunt tibi' significat si non fidem {1}habeant: `et non audiunt 
vocem signi prioris' significat si non oboediunt annuntiato ex Verbo, quod pro spirituali et rationali homine fierent non spirituales et non rationales: `et credent voci signi posterioris' significat 
quod fidem haberent praenuntiato ex Verbo, quod fierent veri profanatores: `et erit, si non credunt etiam binis signis illis significat si prorsus nullam haberent fidem, quod talia eventura: `et non 
audiunt vocem tuam' significat si nec aliquid oboedientiae praestant: `accipias de aquis fluvii' significat falsa scientifica: `et effundas in aridam' significat immissionem in naturale: et erunt aquae 
quas accepisti' significat inversionem status: `et erunt in sanguinem in arida' {2} significat falsificationem omnis veri et inde privationem ejus in naturali. 	@1 habeant altered to habent$ 	@2
