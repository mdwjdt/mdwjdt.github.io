Verses 27-30. And it came to pass in the time of her travail, and behold twins were in her womb. And it came to pass when she travailed, and one put out a hand; and the midwife took and bound double-dyed 
upon his hand, saying, This came out first. And it came to pass as he drew back his hand, that behold his brother came out; and she said, Wherefore hast thou broken upon thee a breach? And he called 
his name Perez. And afterward came out his brother, that had the double-dyed upon his hand; and he called his name Zerah. "And it came to pass in the time," signifies a following state; "of her travail," 
signifies acknowledgement on the part of internal truth; "and behold twins were in her womb," signifies both things of the church; "and it came to pass when she travailed," signifies production; 
"and one put out a hand," signifies power; "and the midwife took," signifies the natural; "and bound double-dyed upon his hand" signifies that she put a mark upon it-"double-dyed" denotes good; "saying, 
This came out first," signifies that it had the priority; "and it came to pass, as he drew back his hand," signifies that it concealed its power; "that behold his brother came out," signifies the 
truth of good; "and she said, Wherefore hast thou broken upon thee a breach?" signifies its apparent separation from good; "and he called his name Perez," signifies the quality; "and afterward came 
out his brother," signifies good actually prior; "that had the double-dyed upon his hand" signifies acknowledgment that it was good; "and he called his name Zerah," signifies the quality. </p>

Verses 27-30 And it happened at the time she was giving birth, that behold, there were twins in her womb. And it happened as she was giving birth, that one put out a hand; and the midwife took and bound 
on his hand a twice-dyed thread, saying, This one came out first. And it happened as he drew back his hand, that behold, his brother came out; and she said, Why have you made a breach upon yourself? 
And he called his name Perez. And afterwards his brother came out, on whose hand was the twice-dyed thread; and he called his name Zerah. </p>
<p>'It happened at the time' means the subsequent state. 'As 
she was giving birth' means acknowledgement on the part of internal truth. 'That behold, there were twins in her womb' means the two essentials of the Church. 'And it happened as she was giving birth' 
means a bringing forth. 'That one put out a hand' means power. 'And the midwife took' means the natural. 'And bound on his hand a twice-dyed thread' means that a sign was placed on it - 'twice-dyed' 
meaning good. 'Saying, This one came out first' means that it had priority of place. 'And it happened as he drew back his hand' means that it concealed its own power. 'That behold, his brother came 
out' means the truth of good. 'And she said, Why have you made a breach upon yourself?' means this truth's apparent separation from good. 'And he called his name Perez' means the essential nature of it. 
'And afterwards his brother came out' means good which in actual fact is prior. 'On whose hand was the twice-dyed thread' means the acknowledgement that good is such. 'And he called his name Zerah' 
means the essential nature of it. </p>

Vers. 27-30.  Et factum in tempore parere illam, et ecce gemini in utero illius. Et factum in parere illam, et dedit manum, et accepit obstetrix, et ligavit super manu ejus dibaphum, dicendo, Hic 
exivit prius. Et factum, sicut reducit manum suam, et ecce exivit frater ejus, et dixit, Quid rupisti super te rupturam? et vocavit nomen ejus Perez. Et postea exivit frater ejus, cujus super manu
