<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第887节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>887.</strong>“水从地上退了”表这些事物就是这样，因为现在造成阻碍的虚假少了。这一点从第8节中类似句子的含义清楚可知。至于在第二状态，也就是此处所论述的状态中造成阻碍的虚假比以前少了，实情乃是这样：人所获得的一切虚假都会保留下来，一个也不会被消灭，如前所述。不过，当人正在重生时，这些虚假会被主折向真理，而这些真理就被植入在他里面。因此，它们看上去似乎被驱散了，并且是被赋予他的良善所驱散。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]887.</strong> The meaning of the water had lessened off the earth is that these things were now possible because falsity was not so overpowering that it got in the way. This is established by the symbolism of the same words above in verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_887/bible_king-james-version_genesis_8_8" target=_top>8</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_887/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_871" target=_top>871</a>].<br />Regarding the fact that in the second stage (the stage referred to by this verse) falsity was not so overpowering that it got in the way, as it had previously, the situation is this: All the falsity we latch on to stays with us; as already mentioned [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_887/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_868" target=_top>868</a>], not one false idea is obliterated. But when we are being reborn, true ideas are sown in us, and the Lord bends our false thinking in the direction of those ideas. Then falsity seems to have been dispelled, and it is the goodness he gives us as a gift that accomplishes this. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 887</b></p><p><b>887.</b>
That the waters were abated from off the earth. That this signifies that these things were so because the falsities that impeded were less abundant than before, is evident from the signification of the 
same words above, at the eighth verse. As to the falsities that impeded being less abundant in the second state, which is now treated of, the case is that all the falsities which man has acquired remain, 
so that not one is abolished, as before said; but when man is being regenerated, there are truths implanted to which the falsities are bent by the Lord, and thus appear as if shaken off, and this 
by means of the goods with which the man is being gifted. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 887</b></p><p><b>887.</b>
The waters abated from over the earth' means that all this was so because the obstructive falsities were now fewer. This is clear from the meaning of the same words that have appeared already in verse 8. As regards the obstructive falsities being fewer than previously in this second state which is the subject here, all the falsities a person has acquired so remain with him that not one is done away 
with, as stated already. But when a person is being regenerated truths are planted in him towards which falsities are turned by the Lord. It thus appears as though they have been dispersed, dispersed 
by means of the goods which he is given. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 887</b>
</p><b>887.</b>
Quod 'diminutae aquae de super terra' significent quod haec ita, quia falsitates non tantae, quae impedirent, constat a significatione eorundem verborum prius, vers. 8. Quod falsitates non tantae, ut 
prius, quae impedirent, in secundo statu, de quo hic agitur, ita se habet; quod omnes falsitates quas sibi acquisivit homo, remaneant sic ut non una aboleatur, ut prius dictum; sed cum regeneratur homo, 
sunt vera quae inseminantur, ad quae falsa flectuntur a Domino, et sic apparent quasi discussae; et quidem per bona quibus donatur. </p>
