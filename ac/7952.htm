<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7952节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7952.</strong>“那一夜，法老和一切臣仆，并埃及众人都起来了”表所有受到诅咒的人，无一例外地被带入由邪恶所生的纯粹虚假的状态，他们对那些属于属灵教会的人感到厌恶和惧怕。这从“夜”、“法老”、“他的臣仆”和“埃及众人”的含义清楚可知：“夜”是指一种由邪恶所生的纯粹虚假的状态，如前所述（<a href="7947.htm">7947</a>节），因而是指诅咒，无论你说一种由邪恶所生的纯粹虚假的状态，还是说诅咒，都是一回事，因为那些陷入这种状态的人受到诅咒；“法老”、“他的臣仆”和“埃及众人”是指他们所有人，无一例外。它还表示他们对那些属于属灵教会的人感到厌恶和惧怕，这一点从接下来的经文明显看出来。因为下一节说，法老召摩西和亚伦来，叫他们“从他民中出去”；埃及人把他们赶出去（12:39）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7952</b></p><p><b>7952.</b>
And Pharaoh rose up in that night, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians. That this signifies that all and each of the damned, when they were let into mere falsity derived from evil, felt aversion 
and fear for those who were of the spiritual church, is evident from the signification of "night," as being a state of mere falsity from evil (as above, n. 7947), and hence damnation; for whether 
you say a state of mere falsity from evil, or damnation, it is the same, because they who are in this state are damned; and from the signification of "Pharaoh," of "his servants," and of "all the Egyptians," 
as being all and each one. That it is also signified that they felt aversion and fear for those who were of the spiritual church, is plain from what follows; for Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, 
and said that they should "go away from the midst of his people;" and the Egyptians drove them out (verse 39). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7952</b></p><p><b>7952.</b>
'And Pharaoh rose that night, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians' means that when all the damned without exception were brought into a state of nothing but falsity arising from evil they felt 
a loathing and fear of those belonging to the spiritual Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'night' as a state of nothing but falsity arising from evil, as above in <a href="7947.htm">7947</a>, and therefore damnation, 
for whether you say a state of nothing but falsity arising from evil or damnation it amounts to the same thing since those in that state have been damned; and from the meaning of 'Pharaoh, his servants, 
and all the Egyptians' as all of them without exception. The further meaning that they felt a loathing and fear of those belonging to the spiritual Church is evident from what follows. For [the 
next verse] says that Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and told them to go away from the midst of his people, and verse 39 that the Egyptians drove them out. </p>

</p><b>7952.</b>
`Et surrexit Pharao nocte ista, et omnes servi illius, et omnes Aegyptii': quod significet quod damnati omnes et singuli cum in merum falsum (c)ex malo immissi sunt, apperciperent aversationem (c)et 
timorem pro illis qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, constat ex significatione `noctis' quod sit status meri falsi ex malo, ut supra n. 7947, et inde damnatio; sive enim dicas statum meri falsi ex malo, sive 
{1}damnationem, idem est, nam qui in illo statu sunt damnati sunt; ex significatione `Pharaonis, servorum illius, et omnium Aegyptiorum' quod sint omnes et singuli; quod etiam significetur quod apperciperent 
aversationem ac timorem pro illis qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, patet a sequentibus; nam vocavit Pharao Moschen et Aharonem, et dixit quod abirent e medio populi sui; et {2}Aegyptii expulerunt 
illos, vers. 39. 	@1 damnationis$ 	@2 quod Aegyptii expellerent$ </p>
