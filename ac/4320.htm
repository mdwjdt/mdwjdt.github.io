<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4320节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4320.</strong>唯独从主而来的生命在每个人身上都看似在他自己里面，这由于主对全人类的爱或仁慈。也就是说，祂的旨意就是使祂自己的东西成为每个人自己的，并将永恒的幸福赐给每个人。众所周知，爱将它自己的东西赋予别人，因为它在对方里面显现自己，将使自己呈现在他里面。那么神性之爱的情形又会如何呢？恶人也接受出自主的生命，这种接受如同世上的物体；所有物体都从太阳接受光，并由此接受色彩；只是每种物体对它们的接受都取决于该物体所取的形式。吸收并扭曲这光的物体显出黑色或丑陋的颜色，然而它们是从太阳之光获得其黑色和丑陋。恶人当中出自主的光或生命也是如此；但这生命并不是生命，而是所谓的属灵死亡。</p>

That the life which is from the Lord alone appears with everyone as if it were in himself, is from the Lord's love or mercy toward the universal human race, in that He wills to appropriate to each one 
what is His own, and to give to everyone eternal happiness. It is known that love appropriates to another what is its own; for it presents itself within the other, and makes itself present in him. How 
much more the Divine love! That the evil also receive the life which is from the Lord, is as with objects in the world, all of which receive light from the sun, and thereby colors, but according to 
their forms. Objects which suffocate and pervert the light appear of a black or foul color, but yet have their blackness and foulness from the sun's light. So is it with the light or life from the Lord 
with the evil; but this life is not life, but is (as it is called) spiritual death. </p>

The reason why the life which comes from the Lord alone seems with everyone to be intrinsically his own lies in the Lord's love or mercy towards the whole human race. That is to say, His will is to make 
that which is His every person's own and to confer eternal happiness on every person. It is well known that love imparts that which is its own to another, for it manifests itself within that other 
and causes itself to be present within him. What then must the situation be with Divine love? The reception by the evil also of the life which comes from the Lord is like objects in the world, all of 
which receive light from the sun and as a result colours, though each object receives these according to the form it takes. Objects which absorb the light and pervert it appear black or hideous, and 
yet they acquire their black and hideous appearance from the light of the sun. So too with the light or life with the evil which comes from the Lord, though this life is not really life but, as it is 
also called, spiritual death. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 4320</b>
</p><b>4320.</b>
Quod vita quae a solo Domino, appareat apud unumquemque sicut foret in ipso, est ex amore seu misericordia Domini erga universum genus humanum, quod nempe unicuique velit appropriare quod Suum est, 
et unicuique dare felicitatem aeternam; quod amor appropriet alteri quod suum est, notum est, sistit enim se in altero, et praesentem in illo facit, quid non Amor Divinus?  Quod mali etiam recipiant 
vitam quae a Domino, se habet sicut objecta mundi, quae omnia recipiunt lucem a sole et inde colores, sed secundum formas; objecta quae suffocant lucem et pervertunt, apparent colore nigro aut 
foedo, at usque nigrum suum et foedum habent a luce solis; ita lux seu vita a Domino apud malos; at haec vita non est vita sed est, sicut vocatur, mors spiritualis. </p>
