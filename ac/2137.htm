<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2137.</strong>那时主人性中的直觉状态以“幔利橡树”来表示（1节）。祂在这种状态下发觉显现在其人性面前的神性（2节）。祂对此感到欣喜（3节）；并渴望神性通过披上某种属世之物而更接近祂的人性（4节），祂的人性则通过披上属天之物而更接近神性（5节）。祂所披戴的属天之物和由此衍生的属灵之物以作饼的“三斗细面”来表示（6节）。并且，在这种状态中，祂感觉舒适自然，这一点以“牛犊”来表示（7节）；结果就是舒适，以及神性与人性，并人性与神性的交流（8节）。</p>

The Lord's state of perception in the Human at that time is signified by the "oak-groves of Mamre" (verse 1); and that in this state He perceived the Divine which was manifesting itself before His Human 
(verse 2); at which He rejoiced (verse 3); and desired that the Divine should draw nearer to His Human by putting on something natural (verse 4), and His Human nearer to the Divine by putting on the 
celestial (verse 5). The celestial and the derivative spiritual, which He put on, are signified by the "three measures of meal of fine flour" of which the cakes were made (verse 6); and that He also 
put on a conforming natural, is signified by the "son of an ox" (verse 7); the result being conformation, and a communication of the Divine with the Human, and of the Human with the Divine (verse 8). </p>

The Lord's state of perception within the Human at that time is meant by the oak-groves of Mamre, verse 1. In this state He perceived the Divine, which was manifesting itself to His Human, verse 2 - 
at which He rejoiced, verse 3; also, in this state, He desired that the Divine should draw nearer to His Human by taking on something natural, verse 4, and that the Human should draw nearer to the Divine 
by taking on the celestial, verse 5 - the celestial, and the spiritual deriving from this, which He took upon Himself being meant by the three measures of the meal of fine flour from which the cakes 
were made, verse 6; and then, in this state, He put on a conformable natural, which is meant by the young bull, verse 7; as a result conformability existed and a communication of the Divine with the 
Human, and of the Human with the Divine, verse 8. </p>

Status perceptionis Domini in Humano tunc, significatur per `querceta Mamre,' vers. 1: in quo quod apperciperet Divinum quod se coram Humano (o)Ipsius' manifestaret, vers. 2: quo gavisus vers. 3: et 
quod vellet ut Divinum ad Ipsius Humanum propius accederet, induendo aliquid naturale, vers. 4: et quod Humanum Ipsius propius ad Divinum, induendo caeleste, vers. 5: caeleste e inde spirituale quod 
induit, significatur per `tria sata farinae similaginis ex quibus placentae,' vers. 6: et quod etiam induerit conforme naturale `quod' significatur per `filium bovis,' vers. 7: inde conformatio, e communicatio 
Divini cum Humano et Humani cum Divino, vers. 8 </p>
