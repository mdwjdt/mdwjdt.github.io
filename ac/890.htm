<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第890节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>890.</strong>“放出鸽子”表接受信之善与真的状态。这同样从前面所述（8:10）清楚可知，因为这些话是一样的，意义也相同，唯一区别在于，那一节的主题是第二状态，而本节的主题是第三状态。第三状态是用“鸽子没有回来”、以及“挪亚移开方舟的盖”和最后“他出了方舟”来描述的，因为土地面干了，地也都干了。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]890.</strong> The symbolism of and sent the dove out as the right conditions for receiving the goodness and truth of faith is likewise established by things said above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_890/bible_king-james-version_genesis_8_10" target=_top>10</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_890/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_882" target=_top>882</a>]. The words are the same and so is the meaning, except that the subject there is the second stage and here it is the third.<br />The third stage is depicted in the dove's not returning, Noah's removal of the ark's roof, and his eventual departure from the ark because the face of the ground, and the earth, had dried up. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 890</b></p><p><b>890.</b>
And sent forth the dove. That this signifies a state of receiving the goods and truths of faith, is likewise evident from what was said at the tenth verse, where are the same words and the same meaning, 
except that there the second state, and here the third state, is treated of. The third state is described by the dove's not returning, and also by Noah's removing the covering of the ark, and at length 
by his going forth from the ark because the face of the ground was dried and the earth was dry. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 890</b></p><p><b>890.</b>
'And he sent out the dove' means a state of receiving the goods and truths of faith. This similarly is clear from what has been stated at verse 10, for the words are the same and the sense too, the sole 
difference being that in that verse the subject is the second state, in this verse the third. The third state is described by 'the dove's not coming back', also by 'Noah's removing the covering from 
the ark', and lastly by 'his going out of the ark because the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the ground had dried up and the earth had dried out'.

</p><b>890.</b>
'Et emisit columbam': quod significet statum recipiendi bona et vera fidei, similiter constat ab illis quae dicta sunt ad vers. 10, nam eadem verba sunt et idem sensus, solum quod ibi de secundo statu, 
hic de tertio agatur.  Tertius status describitur per quod 'columba non redierit,' tum quod 'Noah removerit tectum arcae'; demum quod 'exiverit ex arca, quia arefactae facies humi, et exsiccata terra.' </p>
