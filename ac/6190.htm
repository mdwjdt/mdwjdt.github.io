<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6190节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6190.</strong>由于此处论述的主题是流注，并且流注这个词经常被提及，故有必要提前说一说何为流注。要说明何谓属灵的流注，最好的方式就是对照发生并出现在这个世界的属世流注。例如，太阳的热流入地上的万物，并照着一年四季和地上的气候而变化多样；光也是流入这些物体，并且不仅照着一日四时和一年四季而变化多样，还照着气候进一步发生变化。从以下事实可以看出何为流注：太阳的热流入地上的万物，产生植物生命；光也流入这些物体，支持这植物生命，还产生不同的色彩和美景。何为流注同样从这热流入我们身体的表面，以及光流入眼睛可以看出来；亦同样从声音流入耳朵，以及其它类似例子可以看出来；由此可以明白何为从主而来的生命的流注。主是天堂的太阳，是系爱之良善的天堂之热的源头，也是系信之真理的天堂之光的源头。人还能明显感受它们的流注，因为天堂之热，就是爱，产生存在于人里面的生命之热；天堂之光，就是信，产生他的理解力；事实上，从主发出的信之真理光照他的理解力。但这两种流注都具有多样化，因为它们的确切性质取决于人们接受它们的方式。</p>

As the subject here treated of is Influx, and this is mentioned so frequently, it is necessary to say in advance what influx is. What is meant by spiritual influx cannot be better seen than by means 
of the natural influxes which take place and appear in this world-as by the influx of heat from the sun into all things of the earth, with all variety in accordance with the seasons of the year and the 
climates of the earth; and by the influx of light into the same, with all variety likewise in accordance with the times of the days and also of the years, also in a varied manner according to the climates. 
From the influx of heat from the sun into all things of the earth, whence comes vegetative life; and from the influx of light into the same, whence comes support to that life, and also colors 
and displays of beauties; in like manner from the influx of the same heat into the surface of our bodies, and also of light into the eye; likewise from the influx of sound into the ear; and from other 
instances of a similar kind, it may be comprehended what is the influx of life from the Lord, who is the Sun of heaven, from whom comes heavenly heat, which is the good of love, and heavenly light, which 
is the truth of faith. The influx of these is also plainly felt, for heavenly heat which is love produces the vital heat which is in man, and heavenly light which is faith produces his understanding, 
because the truth of faith which proceeds from the Lord enlightens his intellectual; but in both cases with much variety, for it is according to the reception on the part of man. </p>

Since influx is the subject under discussion and the word is used so frequently, a preliminary statement must be made as to what influx is. There is no better way to show what is meant by spiritual influx 
than by comparison with natural kinds of influx that take place and reveal themselves in the world. There is for example the flow of heat from the sun into all earthly objects and all its variations 
that are determined by the seasons of the year and climates of the earth. Then there is the flow of light into those same objects and all its variations that are determined by the times of day as 
well as seasons of the year, further varied also by climates It can be seen from the fact that the flow of heat from the sun into all earthly objects gives rise to plant-life, and that the flow of light 
into the same objects assists that plant-life and also produces different colours and beautiful sights. What influx is may be recognized in a similar way from the flow of that same heat into the surface-area 
of our bodies, and also of light into the eye. Likewise from the flow of sound into the ear, and from other inflowings like it, one may understand what the influx of life from the Lord is. 
He is the Sun of heaven and the Source of heaven's heat, which is the good of love, and the Source of heaven's light, which is the truth of faith. One can also plainly feel the inflow of them, for heavenly 
heat, which is love, produces the vital heat that exists in a person, while heavenly light, which is faith, produces his power of understanding, since the truth of faith, which goes forth from 
the Lord, gives his understanding light. But there is much variation to both these kinds of influx, for the exact nature of them is determined by the ways people receive them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 6190</b>
</p><b>6190.</b>
Quia agitur de influxu, et is tam saepe nominatur, in antecessum est dicendum quid influxus:  quid per influxum spiritualem intelligitur, non melius constare potest quam per influxus naturales qui existunt 
et apparent in mundo:  sicut per influxum caloris a sole in omnia telluris cum omni varietate secundum anni tempora et telluris climata:  et per influxum lucis in eadem, etiam cum omni varietate 
secundum tempora dierum et quoque annorum, diversimode etiam secundum climata:  ex influxu caloris a sole in omnia telluris, unde vita vegetativa:  et ex influxu lucis in eadem, unde adjutorium vitae 
illius et quoque colores et pulchritudinum apparentiae:  similiter ex influxu ejusdem caloris in corporis nostri ambitum:  tum lucis in oculum:  pariter ex influxu soni in aurem, et ex parilibus aliis, 
comprehendi potest quid influxus vitae a Domino Qui est Sol caeli, a Quo calor caelestis qui est bonum amoris, et lux caelestis quae est verum fidei; influxus horum etiam manifeste sentitur, calor 
enim caelestis qui est amor, facit calorem vitalem qui est in homine, et lux caelestis quae est fides, facit ejus intellectum, nam verum quod fidei, quod procedit a Domino, illustrat ejus intellectuale; 
sed utrumque cum multa varietate, nam se habent secundum receptiones ab homine. </p>
