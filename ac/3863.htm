<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3863节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3863.</strong>“因为她说，耶和华看见”在至高意义上表预见，在内在意义上表信，在内层意义上表理解，在外在意义上表看见，在此表从主所接受的信。这从“看见”的含义清楚可知，如下文所述。前面的阐述表明，以雅各十二个儿子命名的十二支派表示真理与良善，或信与爱的全部事物，因而表示教会的全部事物；还表明，每个支派表示某种普遍划分，因而十二支派表示囊括和包含凡属教会的一切具体事物在里面的普遍划分，在普遍意义上表示属于主国度的一切事物。“流便”所表示的普遍划分是指，信是第一个普遍划分，这是因为人正在重生或变成教会时，他必须首先学习并吸收信，也就是属灵真理的事物，他正是藉着信或真理的教义被引入重生。因为人具有这样的性质，他凭自己不知道何为天上的良善，而是必须通过教义，也就是所谓的信之教义学习它。信的一切教义皆视生命为目的，并且它因拥有生命，故也拥有良善，因为良善是生命的总括和实质。<br />古人争论的焦点就是谁是教会头生的，是信之真理还是爱之良善。那些认为信之真理是头生的之人通过外在表象争论，并确定这种真理是头生的，因为它是并应是首先要学习的，还因为人通过它被引入良善。但他们不知道，良善本质上是头生的，它被主通过内在人被注入，以便内在人能采纳并接受通过外在人被引入的真理。他们也没有意识到，良善含有来自主的生命在里面，或真理若不经由良善而来，就没有任何生命可言，以至于良善就是真理的灵魂，并将真理归为己有，以真理为衣，如同灵魂以身体为衣。由此可见，在人重生期间，从外在表象上看，真理占据第一位，可以说是头生的；尽管本质上良善占据第一位，是头生的，并且一旦人重生了，它就实实在在地占据第一位。这就是真相（参看<a href="3539.htm">3539</a>，<a href="3548.htm">3548</a>，<a href="3556.htm">3556</a>，<a href="3563.htm">3563</a>，<a href="3570.htm">3570</a>，<a href="3576.htm">3576</a>，<a href="3603.htm">3603</a>，<a href="3701.htm">3701</a>节）。<br />本章和此前几章所论述的主题是属世层的重生，此处的主题是它的第一个状态，也就是通过真理被引入良善的状态，故雅各的头生子，或流便以“耶和华看见”为名，“耶和华看见”在内在意义上表示源于主的信。就本身而言，信包括理解中的信和意愿中的信。知道并理解信之真理被称作认知中的信，而意愿真理则被称作意愿中的信。前者，就是认知中的信就是“流便”所表示的信，而后者，就是意愿中的信，则是“西缅”所表示的信。谁都能看出，认知中的信，或理解真理的能力先于意愿中的信，或实际意愿真理而来。因为当一个人不知道诸如天上良善之类的事物时，他必须首先知道它的存在，然后在能意愿它之前理解它是什么。<br />“看见”在外在意义上表示看见，这是显而易见的，无需解释。“看见”在内层意义上表示理解，这同样是显而易见的，因为内在人的看见无非是理解，这也是为何在日常用语中，理解被称作内视，并且光这个词就用来论及它，以及外视，并被称作智性之光（intellectual light）。“看见”在内在意义上表示从主所接受的信，这一点从以下事实清楚看出来：内层认知除了以真理与良善为目标外，并没有其它目标，因为这些是信的目标。以信之真理为目标的这种内层认知或内视，并不像以涉及文明道德生活的真理为目标的认知那样显明自身，因为它存在于后者里面，居于天堂之光。只要人居于尘世之光，这天堂之光就处在模糊的状态。然而，它仍向那些重生之人揭示它自己，尤其藉着良知来揭示。“看见”在至高意义上明显表示预见，因为论及主的智慧是一种无限的智慧，这种智慧无非是预见。“流便”以之为名的“看见”在内在意义上表示从主所接受的信，这一点从圣言中的许多经文明显看出来。对此，引用以下经文：<br />耶和华对摩西说，你制造一条火蛇，挂在杆子上，凡被咬的，一望这蛇，就必得活。摩西便制造一条铜蛇，挂在杆子上，凡被蛇咬的，一望这铜蛇，就活了。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.8.htm">21:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.9.htm">9</a>）<br />铜蛇代表主的外在感官或属世直觉（参看<a href="197.htm">197</a>节）；“铜”表示属世之物（<a href="425.htm">425</a>，<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>节）。对祂的信由那些看见或望它的人活了来代表，对此，主自己在约翰福音中教导说：<br />摩西在旷野怎样举蛇，人子也必照样被举起来；叫一切信祂的，不至灭亡，反得永生。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.14.htm">3:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.15.htm">15</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />主说，你去对这百姓说，你们听是要听见，却不明白；看是要看见，却不晓得。要使这百姓心蒙脂油，耳朵发沉，眼睛昏迷。恐怕眼睛看见，耳朵听见，心里明白。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛6.9.htm">6:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛6.10.htm">10</a>）<br />很明显，“看见，却不晓得”在此表示理解真理，却不承认它。“眼睛昏迷，恐怕眼睛看见”表示剥夺他们对真理的认知；“看见”在此表示信主，这一点从主在马太福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.13.htm">13:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.14.htm">14</a>）和约翰福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.36.htm">12:36</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.37.htm">37</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.39.htm">39</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.40.htm">40</a>）中的话清楚可知。<br />以西结书：<br />人子啊，你住在悖逆的家中，他们有眼睛可以看，却看不见，有耳朵可以听，却听不见。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结12.2.htm">12:2</a>）<br />“有眼睛可以看，却看不见”表示他们能理解信之真理，却不意愿，这是由于“悖逆的家”所表示的邪恶，这邪恶会给虚假带来一种不真实的光，给真理带来黑暗，如以赛亚书中的这些话：<br />这是悖逆的百姓、说谎的儿女，不肯听从耶和华训诲的儿女；他们对先见说；不要看；对见异象的人说，不要为我们去见正直的事，要向我们说柔和的话，看虚幻的事。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.9.htm">30:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.10.htm">10</a>）<br /><br />在黑暗中行走的百姓看见了大光；住在死荫之地的人有光照耀他们。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.2.htm">9:2</a>）<br />“看见大光”表示接受并相信信之真理。经上说，天上的光照耀那些有信的人，因为天堂之光就是就是出自神性良善的神性真理。<br /><br />耶和华将沉睡的灵浇灌你们，封闭你们的眼，蒙盖你们的先知，你们的头就是先见。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛29.10.htm">29:10</a>）<br />“封闭眼”表封闭对真理的认知，“眼”表认知（参看<a href="2701.htm">2701</a>节）。“蒙盖先见”表蒙盖那些知道并教导信之真理的人。在过去，“先见”被称为“先知”，“先知”表那些施行教导的人，以及教义的真理（参看<a href="2534.htm">2534</a>节）。<br />祭司和先知因浓酒犯错；他们在那些看见的人当中犯错，在审判时跌跌撞撞。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛28.7.htm">28:7</a>）<br />此处的意思是一样的。他们跌跌撞撞所行的“审判”表示信之真理（参看<a href="2235.htm">2235</a>节）。<br />那能看的人，眼不再昏迷；能听的人，耳必得听闻。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛32.3.htm">32:3</a>）<br /><br />你的眼必见王的荣美，必见辽阔之地。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛33.17.htm">33:17</a>）<br />“见王的荣美”表出自主并凭良善被视为荣美的信之真理。“见辽阔之地”表爱之良善。因为“王”表信之真理（参看<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>，<a href="3009.htm">3009</a>，<a href="3670.htm">3670</a>节）；这真理凭良善而以“荣美”来论及（<a href="553.htm">553</a>，<a href="3080.htm">3080</a>，<a href="3821.htm">3821</a>节）；“地”表爱之良善（<a href="620.htm">620</a>，<a href="636.htm">636</a>，<a href="3368.htm">3368</a>，<a href="3379.htm">3379</a>节）。马太福音：<br />心里洁净的人有福了，因为他们必得见神。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.8.htm">5:8</a>）<br />此处很明显，“见神”是指相信祂，因而凭信看见祂；因为凡拥有信的人都通过信见神，因为神就在信里面，且在那构成正信之信里面。<br /><br />倘若你一只眼叫你跌倒，就把它剜出来；你只有一只眼进入永生，强如有两只眼被丢在火烧的地狱（希腊文：欣嫩子谷）。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太18.9.htm">18:9</a>）<br />此处也很明显，“眼”不是指眼睛，也不是说眼要被剜出来，因为叫人跌倒的，不是眼睛，而是此处“眼”所表示的对真理的理解（<a href="2701.htm">2701</a>节）。“只有一只眼进入永生，强如有两只眼被丢在火烧的地狱”表示不知道、理解信之真理强如知道、理解它们，却过着邪恶的生活。<br />同一福音书：<br />你们的眼睛是有福的，因为看见了；你们的耳朵也是有福的，因为听见了。我实在告诉你们：从前有许多先知和义人渴望看你们所看的，却没有看见。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.16.htm">13:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.17.htm">17</a>；约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.40.htm">12:40</a>）<br />此处“看见”表知道并理解构成对主之信的事物，因而表示信。因为他们有福不是因为他们看见了主，看见了祂的神迹，乃因他们信。这一点从约翰福音中的这些话可以看出来：<br />我对你们说过，你们已经看见我，还是不信。我父的意思是叫一切见子而信的人得永生。这不是说有人看见过父，惟独与父同在的，祂看见过父。我实实在在地告诉你们：信我的人有永生。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.36.htm">6:36</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.40.htm">40</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.46.htm">46</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.47.htm">47</a>）<br />“看见还是不信”表示知道信之真理还是不接受它们，“见而信”表示知道并接受它们。“不是说有人看见过父，惟独与父同在的，祂看见过父”表示神性良善若不藉着神性真理就无法得到承认。“父”是指神性良善，“子”是指神性真理（参看<a href="3704.htm">3704</a>节）。因此，内义就是，没有人能拥有属天良善，除非他承认主。<br />同样在同一福音书：<br />从来没有人见过神，除了父怀里的独生子将祂表明出来。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.18.htm">1:18</a>）<br /><br />耶稣说，人看见我，就是看见那差我来的。我到世上来，乃是光，叫凡信我的，不住在黑暗里。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.45.htm">12:45</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.46.htm">46</a>）<br />此处经上明确声称“看见”表示信，或拥有信。<br />耶稣说，你们若认识我，也就认识我的父。从今以后，你们认识祂，并且已经看见祂。人看见了我，就是看见了父。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.7.htm">14:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.9.htm">9</a>）<br /><br />就是真理的圣灵，乃世人不能接受的，因为不见祂，也不认识祂；我不撇下你们为孤儿，我必到你们这里来。还有不多的时候，世人不再看见我；你们却看见我，因为我活着，你们也要活着。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.17.htm">14:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.19.htm">19</a>）<br />此处“看见”表拥有信，因为唯独通过信才能看见主。实际上，信是爱的眼睛，因为主正是被爱经由信看见，爱是信的生活。因此，经上说“你们却看见我，因为我活着，你们也要活着”。<br /><br />耶稣说，我为审判到这世上来，叫不能看见的，可以看见；能看见的，反瞎了眼。法利赛就说，难道我们也瞎了眼吗？耶稣对他们说，你们若瞎了眼，就没有罪了；但如今你们说，我们能看见，所以你们的罪还在。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约9.39.htm">9:39</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约9.41.htm">41</a>）<br />此处“能看见的”表示那些自以为比别人更聪明的人，对于他们，经上说“反瞎了眼”，也就是不接受信。“不能看见”或“瞎了眼”论及那些处于虚假的人，以及那些无知之人（参看<a href="2383.htm">2383</a>节）。路加福音：<br />神国的奥秘只叫你们知道；至于别人，就用比喻，叫他们看也看不见，听也听不明。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.10.htm">8:10</a>）<br /><br />我实在告诉你们，站在这里的，有人在没尝死味以前，必看见神的国。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.27.htm">9:27</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可9.1.htm">9:1</a>）<br />“见神的国”表相信。<br />耶稣对门徒说，日子将到，你们巴不得看见人子的一个日子，却不得看见。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路17.22.htm">17:22</a>）<br />这论述的是时代的终结，或教会的末期，此时信不复存在。<br /><br />到了同他们坐席的时候，耶稣拿起饼来，祝谢了，掰开，递给他们。他们的眼睛开了，这才认出祂来。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.30.htm">24:30</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.31.htm">31</a>）<br />这次事件的意思是，主通过良善，而非没有良善的真理显现，因为“饼”表示爱之良善（<a href="276.htm">276</a>，<a href="680.htm">680</a>，<a href="2165.htm">2165</a>，<a href="2177.htm">2177</a>，<a href="3478.htm">3478</a>，<a href="3735.htm">3735</a>，<a href="3813.htm">3813</a>节）。从这些和其它经文明显可知，“看见”在内在意义上表示从主所接受的信，因为除了出自主的信外，其它信并非正信。这信能使人“看见”，也就是相信。而源于自我或人自己的东西之信并非信，因为它使人视虚假为真理，视真理为虚假；他若视真理为真理，却仍看不见，是因为他不信，因为他在它们里面看见他自己，而不是看见主。<br />“看见”表示拥有对主的信，这一点从前面关于天堂之光的反复说明很清楚地看出来，即天堂之光来自主，故含有聪明和智慧，因而含有对祂的信在里面，因为对主之信从内在存在于聪明和智慧里面。因此，如天使那样通过那光“看见”无非表示对主之信。主自己也在这光里面，因为这光从祂发出。这光也是在那些拥有对主的信之人的良知里面闪耀的光，尽管活在肉身时，此人并未意识到这一事实，因为那时这光被尘世之光模糊了。</p>

For she said, Because Jehovah hath seen. That in the supreme sense this signifies foresight, in the internal sense faith, in the interior sense understanding, and in the external sense sight, in the 
present case faith from the Lord, is evident from the signification of "seeing," concerning which in what follows. From what has been said above, it may be seen that the twelve tribes, named from the 
twelve sons of Jacob, signified all things of truth and good, or of faith and love, thus all things of the church, and that each tribe signified some universal; thus the twelve tribes signified the twelve 
universals which comprehend and include within them all things whatsoever that belong to the church; and in the universal sense, all things that belong to the Lord's kingdom. The universal which 
"Reuben" signifies, is faith. The reason why faith is the first universal, is that when man is being regenerated or becoming a church, he must first learn and become imbued with the things of faith, that 
is, of spiritual truth; for he is introduced by means of the doctrine of faith, or of truth. For man is of such a nature that of himself he does not know what heavenly good is, but must learn it from 
doctrine, which is called the doctrine of faith. Every doctrine of faith regards life as the end, and therefore good, for good is life. [2] It was a controverted point among the ancients, which was 
the firstborn of the church, the truth which is of faith, or the good which is of love. They who maintained that the truth which is of faith is the firstborn, argued from the external appearance, and 
determined this to be the first, because truth is and ought to be first learned, and because by means of it man is introduced to good. But they knew not that good is essentially the firstborn, and 
that it is insinuated by the Lord through the internal man, in order that it may adopt and receive the truth which is introduced through the external man; nor were they aware that in good there is life 
from the Lord, and that in truth there is no life but that which it has through good; thus that good is the soul of truth, and appropriates to itself and puts on truth as the soul does its body. From 
this we can see that according to the external appearance truth is in the first place, and is as it were the firstborn while man is being regenerated; although good is essentially in the first place, 
and is the firstborn, and is placed first when man has been regenerated. (That this is the case may be seen above, n. 3539, 3548, 3556, 3563, 3570, 3576, 3603, 3701.)  [3] As the subject treated of 
in this chapter, and in those which precede, is the regeneration of the natural, and here its first state, which is that of introduction by means of truth to good, therefore the first son of Jacob, or 
Reuben, was named from "Jehovah seeing," which in the internal sense signifies faith from the Lord. Regarded in itself, faith is a faith in the understanding and a faith in the will; to know and understand 
the truth which is of faith is called faith in the understanding; but to will the truth which is of faith is called faith in the will. Faith in the understanding is that which is signified by 
"Reuben;" but faith in the will is what is signified by "Simeon." That faith in the understanding, or the understanding of truth, precedes faith in the will, or the willing of truth, must be evident to 
everyone; for when anything is unknown to man (such as heavenly good), he must first know that it exists, and understand what it is, before he can will it. [4] That in the external sense "to see" signifies 
sight, is evident without explication; and that in the interior sense "to see" signifies understanding, may also be evident, for the sight of the internal man is nothing else than understanding, 
and therefore in common discourse understanding is called internal sight, and light is predicated of it, as of external sight, and is called intellectual light. That in the internal sense "to see" 
denotes faith from the Lord, is evident from the fact that the interior understanding has no other objects than those which are of truth and good, for these are the objects of faith. This interior understanding, 
or internal sight, which has for its objects the truths which are of faith, does not manifest itself so much as does the understanding which has for its objects the truths of civic and moral 
life, for the reason that it is within the latter, and is in the light of heaven, which light is in obscurity so long as man is in the light of the world. Nevertheless with those who have been regenerated, 
it reveals itself, especially by conscience. That in the supreme sense "to see" is foresight, must be evident, for the intelligence which is predicated of the Lord is infinite intelligence, 
which is nothing else than foresight. [5] That "seeing," from which Reuben was named, in the internal sense signifies faith from the Lord, is manifest from very many passages in the Word, of which the 
following may be adduced: </p>
<p>     Jehovah said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a standard; and it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten, and shall see it, shall live. 
Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it upon a standard; and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man, and he looked unto the serpent of brass, he lived again (Num. 21:8-9). That the brazen 
serpent represented the Lord as to the external sensuous or natural, may be seen above (n. 197); and that "brass" signifies the natural (n. 425, 1551). That faith in Him was represented by the living 
again of those who saw, or looked upon it, the Lord Himself teaches in John: </p>
<p>     As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up; that whosoever believeth 
in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life (John 3:14-15). [6] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The Lord said, Go and say unto this people, Hearing hear ye, but do not understand; and seeing see ye, 
and do not know; make the heart of this people fat, and their ears heavy, and blind their eyes; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and their heart should understand (Isa. 
6:9-10).      That "seeing and not knowing" here signifies understanding what is true and yet not acknowledging it, is manifest; and that "blinding the eyes, lest they should see with their eyes" signifies 
depriving them of the understanding of truth; and that "seeing" here signifies faith in the Lord, is evident from the Lord's words in Matthew 13:13-14; and in John 12:36-37, 39-40. [7] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p> 
    Son of man thou dwellest in the midst of the house of rebellion, who have eyes to see, but see not; who have ears to hear, and hear not (Ezek. 12:2); </p>
<p>"having eyes to see but not seeing" signifies 
that they were able to understand the truths of faith, but were not willing, and this because of evils (which are the "house of rebellion") inducing a deceptive light on falsities, and darkness 
on truths, according to these words in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     This is a people of rebellion, lying sons, sons that would not hear the law of Jehovah; who have said to the seers, See not; and to them that have 
vision, See not for us right things, speak to us smooth things, see illusions (Isa. 30:9-10). Again: </p>
<p>     The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light; they that dwelt in the land of 
the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined (Isa. 9:2); </p>
<p>where "seeing a great light" signifies receiving and believing the truths which are of faith. On those who are in faith heavenly light 
is said to "shine," for the light which is in heaven is Divine truth from Divine good. [8] Again: </p>
<p>     Jehovah hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes; the prophets 
and your heads, the seers hath He covered (Isa. 29:10); </p>
<p>"to close the eyes" denotes to close the understanding of truth (that "the eye" denotes the understanding, see above, n. 2701); "covering 
the seers" denotes to cover those who know and teach the truths of faith. Seers were formerly called "prophets," and that "prophets" denote those who teach, and also the truths of doctrine, may be seen 
above (n. 2534). Again: </p>
<p>     The priest and the prophet err through strong drink; they err among the seers; they stumble in judgment (Isa. 28:7); </p>
<p>where the sense is the same; that the "judgment" 
wherein they "stumble" is the truth of faith may be seen above (n. 2235). Again: </p>
<p>     The eyes of them that see shall not be closed, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken (Isa. 32:3). [9] Again: </p>
<p> 
    Thine eyes shall behold the king in his beauty, they shall see the land of far distances (Isa. 33:17); </p>
<p>"to behold the king in beauty" denotes the truths of faith which are from the Lord, which 
are called "beautiful" from good; "to see the land of far distances" denotes the good of love. (That a "king" is the truth of faith may be seen above, n. 1672, 2015, 2069, 3009, 3670; that "beautiful" 
is predicated from good, n. 553, 3080, 3821; and that "land" is the good of love, n. 620, 636, 3368, 3379.) In Matthew: </p>
<p>     Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God (Matt. 5:8); </p>
<p>where 
it is manifest that "to see God" is to believe in Him, thus to see Him by faith; for they who are in faith, from faith see God, because God is in faith, and is that in faith which constitutes true 
faith. [10] Again: </p>
<p>     If thine eye causeth thee to stumble, pluck it out; for it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the gehenna of fire 
(Matt. 18:9); </p>
<p>that in this passage the "eye" does not mean the eye, and that it is not to be plucked out, is manifest, for this does not cause to stumble; but the understanding of truth, which is 
here meant by the "eye" (n. 2701). That it is better not to know and apprehend the truths of faith, than to know and apprehend them and yet live a life of evil, is signified by its "being better to enter 
into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the gehenna of fire." [11] In the same: </p>
<p>     Blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear. Verily I say 
unto you, that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see the things which ye see, but did not see them (Matt. 13:16-17; John 12:40); </p>
<p>"seeing" here denotes knowing and understanding the things 
which are of faith in the Lord, thus faith; for they were not blessed because they saw the Lord, and saw His miracles, but because they believed; as may be seen from these words in John: </p>
<p>     I said 
unto you, that ye also have seen Me, and believe not. This is the will of Him that sent Me, that everyone who seeth the Son, and believeth on Him, should have eternal life. Not that anyone hath seen 
the Father, save He that is with the Father, He hath seen the Father. Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on Me hath eternal life (John 6:36, 40, 46-47); </p>
<p>     "seeing and not believing" 
denotes knowing the truths of faith and not receiving them; "seeing and believing" denotes knowing and receiving them; "no one having seen the Father save He that is with the Father" denotes that Divine 
good cannot be acknowledged except by means of Divine truth (That the "Father" is Divine good, and the "Son" Divine truth, may be seen above, n. 3704.) Hence the internal sense is that no one can 
have celestial good unless He acknowledges the Lord. [12] In like manner in the same Evangelist: </p>
<p>     No one hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He 
hath declared Him (John 1:18). And again: </p>
<p>     Jesus said, He that seeth Me, seeth Him that sent Me. I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth in Me should not abide in darkness (John 
12:45-46); </p>
<p>where it is said plainly that "to see" is to believe, or to have faith. Again: </p>
<p>     Jesus said, If ye had known Me, ye would have known My Father also; and from henceforth ye know Him 
and have seen Him. He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father (John 14:7, 9). Again: </p>
<p>     The Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him; I will not 
leave you orphans; I come unto you. Yet a little while, and the world seeth Me no more; but ye see Me; because I live ye shall live also (John 14:17-19); </p>
<p>where "seeing" signifies having faith, for 
the Lord is seen only by faith, because faith is the eye of love, the Lord being seen by love through faith, and love being the life of faith; wherefore it is said, "Ye see Me; because I live, ye shall 
live also." [13] Again: </p>
<p>     Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they who see not may see; and that they who see may be made blind. The Pharisees said, Are we also blind? Jesus 
said unto them, If ye were blind, ye would not have sin; but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth (John 9:39-41); </p>
<p>here "they who see" denote those who imagine themselves to be more intelligent 
than others, concerning whom it is said that they "should be made blind," that is, should not receive faith. (That "not to see," or "to be blind," is predicated of those who are in falsities, 
and also of those who are in ignorance, may be seen above, n. 2383.) In Luke: </p>
<p>     Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God; but to the rest in parables; that seeing they may 
not see and hearing they may not hear (Luke 8:10). Again: </p>
<p>     I say unto you, There be some standing here who shall not taste of death, until they see the kingdom of God (Luke 9:27; Mark 9:1); </p>
<p>"to 
see the kingdom of God" denotes to believe. Again: </p>
<p>     Jesus said unto His disciples, The days shall come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, but ye shall not see (Luke 
17:22); </p>
<p>where the consummation of the age, or last time of the church, is treated of, when there is no longer any faith. [14] Again: </p>
<p>     It came to pass when Jesus sat down with them, that He took 
the bread, and blessed, and breaking, gave to them; and their eyes were opened, and they knew Him (Luke 24:30-31); </p>
<p>by which was signified that the Lord appears by good, but not by truth without good, 
for "bread" is the good of love (n. 276, 680, 2165, 2177, 3478, 3735, 3813). From these and other passages it is evident that "seeing," in the internal sense, signifies faith from the Lord, for there 
is no other faith which is faith than that which comes from the Lord. This also enables man to "see," that is, to believe; but faith from self, or from what is man's own, is not faith, for it causes 
him to see falsities as truths, and truths as falsities; and if he sees truths as truths, still he does not see, because he does not believe, for he sees himself in them, and not the Lord.  [15] That 
"to see" is to have faith in the Lord, is very plain from what has been frequently said above concerning the light of heaven, namely, that being from the Lord, it is attended with intelligence and wisdom, 
consequently with faith in Him; for faith in the Lord is inwardly within intelligence and wisdom; wherefore "to see" from that light, as angels do, can signify nothing else than faith in the Lord. 
The Lord Himself also is in that light, because it proceeds from Him. It is that light also which shines within the conscience of those who have faith in the Lord, although while he lives in the body 
the man is unaware of the fact, for it is then obscured by the light of the world. </p>

'For she said, Because Jehovah has seen' in the highest sense means foresight, in the internal sense faith, in the interior sense understanding, and in the external sense sight - faith received from 
the Lord being meant here. This is clear from the meaning of 'seeing', dealt with below. What has been presented above shows that the twelve tribes, named after the twelve sons of Jacob, meant all things 
forming part of truth and good, or of faith and love, and so all aspects of the Church. It also shows that each tribe meant some universal division, and so the twelve tribes the twelve universal divisions 
which embrace and include within themselves every specific thing which is part of the Church, and in the universal sense everything that is part of the Lord's kingdom. The universal division 
meant by 'Reuben' is faith. The reason faith is the first universal division is that when a person is being regenerated, or becoming the Church, he must first learn and absorb aspects of faith, that is, 
of spiritual truth, for it is by means of doctrine about faith or truth that he is led into regeneration. For man is such that of himself he does not know what heavenly good is but has to learn about 
it from doctrine, which is called the doctrine of faith. Every doctrine of faith has life as the end in view, and because it has life it also has good in view, for good is the sum and substance of 
life. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Controversy existed among the ancients over which was the firstborn of the Church, whether it was the truth of faith or whether it was the good of love. Those who said that the truth of faith 
was the firstborn based their conclusions on the outward appearance and decided that such truth was the firstborn because it is and must be learned first and because a person is led by means of it 
into good. But they did not know that good is essentially the firstborn and that it is instilled by the Lord through the internal man so that he may adopt and accept the truth which is brought in by 
way of the external. They did not know that good holds life from the Lord within it, or that truth does not possess any life except that which comes through good, so that good is the soul of truth by 
making truth its own and clothing itself with it as the soul does the body. From this it may be seen that to outward appearance truth occupies first place and is so to speak the firstborn while a person 
is being regenerated, though essentially good occupies first place and is the firstborn, and does actually come to occupy it once he has been regenerated. For the truth of this, see <a href="3539.htm">3539</a>, <a href="3548.htm">3548</a>, <a href="3556.htm">3556</a>, <a href="3563.htm">3563</a>, <a href="3570.htm">3570</a>, <a href="3576.htm">3576</a>, <a href="3603.htm">3603</a>, <a href="3701.htm">3701</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The subject in this and previous chapters being the regeneration of the natural - at this point its first state, which is a state of being led by means of truth 
into good - the first son of Jacob, who was Reuben, was so named from the phrase Jehovah seeing, which in the internal sense means faith originating in the Lord. Regarded in itself faith consists in 
faith in the understanding and faith in the will. Knowledge and understanding of the truth of faith is called faith in the understanding, but willing the truth of faith is called faith in the will. The 
former - faith in the understanding - is the faith meant by 'Reuben', but the latter - faith in the will - is that meant by 'Simeon'. It may be seen by anyone that faith existing in the understanding, 
or the ability to understand truth, comes before faith existing in the will, or the actual willing of it. For when a person does not know of something, such as heavenly good, he must first come to 
know of its existence and then to understand what it is before he is able to will it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 'Seeing' in the external sense means sight, as is clear without explanation. 'Seeing' in the interior sense 
means the understanding, as is likewise clear, for the sight that the internal man has is nothing else than the understanding, which also is why in everyday speech the understanding is called internal 
sight, and the word light is used in reference to it as well as to external sight and is called the light of the understanding. 'Seeing' in the internal sense means faith received from the Lord, as 
is clear from the consideration that interior understanding has no other objects than those of truth and good, for these are the objects of faith. This interior understanding, or internal sight, which 
has truths of faith as its objects, does not show itself so plainly as the understanding does which has truths to do with public and private life as its objects, the reason being that it exists inside 
this latter understanding and dwells in the light of heaven, which light is in obscurity as long as a person dwells in the light of the world. Nevertheless it does reveal itself with those who are 
regenerate, in particular by means of conscience. 'Seeing' in the highest sense clearly means foresight, for the intelligence spoken of in reference to the Lord is an infinite intelligence, which is nothing 
else than foresight. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 That 'seeing' after which Reuben was named means in the internal sense faith received from the Lord is evident from very many places in the Word, of which let the following 
be brought forward: In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah said to Moses, Make a serpent and set it on a standard, and it will be that everyone who has been bitten, when he sees it, will live. And Moses made a 
serpent of bronze and set it on a standard. And so it was, if a serpent had bitten a man, when he looked at the serpent of bronze, that he was restored to life again. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2021:8,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 21:8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The bronze serpent' 
represented the Lord's external sensory perception, which is natural, see <a href="197.htm">197</a> - 'bronze' meaning that which is natural, <a href="425.htm">425</a>, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>. Faith in Him was represented by the restoration to life again of 
those who saw it, that is, looked at it, as the Lord Himself teaches in John, </p>
<blockquote>
As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that everyone who believes in Him 
may not perish but have eternal life. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:14,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3:14, 15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The Lord said, Go and say to this people, Hearing, hear - but do not understand; and seeing, see - but do not comprehend. Make 
the heart of this people fat and their ears heavy, and plaster over their eyes, lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and their heart understands. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%206:9,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 6:9, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here it is quite 
evident that 'seeing, see - but do not comprehend' means understanding what is true and yet not acknowledging. The words 'plastering over their eyes, lest they see with their eyes' means depriving 
them of the understanding of truth, faith in the Lord being meant in this case by 'seeing', as is clear from the Lord's words in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matthew%2013:13,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matthew 13:13, 14</a>, and in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2012:36,%2037,%2039,%2040&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 12:36, 37, 39, 40</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Son 
of man, you are dwelling in the midst of a rebellious house, who have eyes to see but they do not see, who have ears to hear but they do not hear. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2012:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 12:2</a> 
</blockquote>
<p>'Eyes to see but they do not see' 
stands for their being able to understand the truths of faith but not willing them. They do not will them on account of evils, meant by 'a rebellious house', which bring an untrue light to falsities and 
darkness to truths, in accordance with the following in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
They were a rebellious people, lying sons, sons who did not wish to hear the law of Jehovah, who said to the seers, Do not see; and 
to those who had visions, Do not see for us things that are right, tell us smooth things, see illusions. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2030:9,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 30:9, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
This people walking in darkness have seen a great light; those 
dwelling in the land of the shadow of death, upon them has the light shone out. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%209:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 9:2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Seeing a great light' stands for receiving and believing the truths of faith. It is over those who have 
faith that heavenly 'light' is said 'to shine out', for the light which is shed in heaven is Divine Truth coming from Divine Good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah has poured out over you a spirit 
of slumber, and has closed your eyes, the prophets and your heads, the seers, He has covered. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2029:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 29:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Closing the eyes' stands for closing the understanding of truth - 'the eye' meaning the 
understanding, see <a href="2701.htm">2701</a>. 'Covering the seers' stands for covering those who know and teach the truths of faith. 'Seers' in former times were called prophets, and prophets mean those who teach as well 
as meaning the truths of doctrine, see <a href="2534.htm">2534</a>. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The priest and the prophet err through strong drink, they err among those who see, they are tottery in judgement. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2028:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 28:7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 
the meaning is similar. 'The judgement in which they are tottery' means the truth of faith, see <a href="2235.htm">2235</a>. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The eyes of those who see will not be closed, and the ears of those who

</blockquote>
<p>'Beholding 
the king in his beauty' stands for beholding truths of faith which come from the Lord and are called beautiful by virtue of good. 'Seeing a land stretching far' stands for seeing the good of love. For 
'the king' means the truth of faith, see <a href="1672.htm">1672</a>, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="2069.htm">2069</a>, <a href="3009.htm">3009</a>, <a href="3670.htm">3670</a>, this being called beautiful by virtue of good, <a href="553.htm">553</a>, <a href="3080.htm">3080</a>, <a href="3821.htm">3821</a>; and 'a land' means the good of love, <a href="620.htm">620</a>, <a href="636.htm">636</a>, <a href="3368.htm">3368</a>, <a href="3379.htm">3379</a>.

</blockquote>
<p>Here it is quite evident that 'seeing God' means believing in Him, and so seeing Him by faith, for people who possess faith, 
from faith see God, since God is within faith and is that within faith which constitutes true faith. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[10]</b>
 In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
If your eye causes you to stumble pluck it out. It is better for 
you to enter into life one-eyed than having two eyes to be thrown into the Gehenna of fire. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2018:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 18:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here, as is quite evident, 'the eye' does not mean the eye. Nor does it mean that the eye 
has to be plucked out, for it is not the eye that causes the stumbling but the understanding of truth meant here by 'the eye', <a href="2701.htm">2701</a>. The law that it is better not to know and grasp the truths of faith 
than to know and grasp them and yet to lead a life of evil is what is meant by 'better to enter into life one-eyed than having two eyes to be thrown into the Gehenna of fire'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[11]</b>
 In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
Blessed

Truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see, but did not see. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:13-17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13:13-17</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2012:40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 12:40</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Seeing' 
stands for knowing and understanding the things that constitute faith in the Lord, and so stands for faith. For it was not their seeing the Lord and seeing His miracles that made them 'blessed' 
but their believing, as becomes clear from the following words in John, </p>
<blockquote>
I said to you that you have both seen Me and not believed. This is the will of Him who sent Me, that everyone who sees 
the Son and believes in Him may have eternal life. No one has seen the Father except Him who is with the Father; He has seen the Father. Truly, truly, I say to you, He who believes in Me has eternal 
life. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%206:36,%2040,%2046,%2047&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 6:36, 40, 46, 47</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Seeing and not believing' stands for knowing the truths of faith and not accepting them, 'seeing and believing' for knowing them and accepting them. The words 'No one 
has seen the Father except Him who is with the Father' stands for not being able to acknowledge Divine Good except through Divine Truth - 'the Father' being Divine Good and 'the Son' Divine Truth, see 
<a href="3704.htm">3704</a>. Consequently the internal sense is that nobody is able to possess heavenly good unless he acknowledges the Lord. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[12]</b>
 Similarly in the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
Nobody has ever seen God; the only begotten 
Son who is in the bosom of the Father, He has made Him known. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:18</a>.

<p>And in the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said, He who sees Me sees Him who sent Me. I have come as Light into the world in order 
that everyone who believes in Me may not remain in darkness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2012:45,%2046&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 12:45, 46</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here it is explicitly stated that 'seeing' means believing or possessing faith. And in the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said, 
If you know Me you know My Father also. And from now you know Him and have seen Him. He who has seen Me has seen the Father. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:7,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:7, 9</a>.

<p>In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
The Spirit of truth the world cannot 
receive because it neither sees Him nor knows Him. I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you. Yet a little while, the world will see Me no longer, but you will see Me; because I live you will 
live also. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:17-19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:17-19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Seeing' stands for possessing faith, for it is solely through faith that the Lord is seen. Actually faith is the eye of love, since it is from love through faith that 
the Lord is seen, love being the life of faith. Hence His statement, 'You will see Me; because I live you will live also'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[13]</b>

Jesus said to the disciples, The days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2017:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 17:22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to 
the close of the age or last period of the Church when no faith exists any longer. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[14]</b>
 In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
It happened, when Jesus was at table with them, that He took the bread and said a blessing, 
and broke it and gave to them. Then their eyes were opened and they recognized Him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2024:30,%2031&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 24:30, 31</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The meaning of this event was that the Lord comes into sight through good, but not through 
truth devoid of good; for 'bread' means the good of love, <a href="276.htm">276</a>, <a href="680.htm">680</a>, <a href="2165.htm">2165</a>, <a href="2177.htm">2177</a>, <a href="3478.htm">3478</a>, <a href="3735.htm">3735</a>, <a href="3813.htm">3813</a>. From these and many other places it is clear that 'seeing' in the internal sense means faith received 
from the Lord, for no other faith exists which is truly faith except faith which comes from the Lord. This is also the faith that enables a person to see, that is, to believe. But faith originating in 
self or a person's proprium is not truly faith, for it causes him to see falsities as truths and truths as falsities; or if he does see truths as truths he does not truly see them because he does not 
believe them. For in them he sees himself and not the Lord. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[15]</b>
 That 'seeing' means possessing faith in the Lord is quite evident from what has been stated often about the light of heaven, namely 
that because it flows from the Lord the light of heaven holds intelligence and wisdom within it, and so holds faith in Him since faith in the Lord is inwardly present in intelligence and wisdom. Consequently 
seeing by that light, as angels do, can mean nothing else than faith in the Lord. The Lord Himself too is within that light because it proceeds from Him. That light is also the light which shines 
within the conscience of those who possess faith in Him, though no one is directly conscious of its doing so as long as he lives in the body, for during that time the light of the world is obscuring 
that light. </p>

`Quia dixit, quod vidit Jehovah': quod significet i supremo sensu praevidentiam, in interno fidem, in interiore intellectum in externo visum, hic fidem a Domino, constat a significatione `videre', 
de qua sequitur.  Ex illis quae praemissa sunt, constare potest quo duodecim tribus ex duodecim filiis Jacobi nominatae, significaverint omnia veri et boni, seu fidei et amoris, ita omnia Ecclesiae, 
et quo unaquaevis tribus aliquod universale, ita duodecim tribus duodecim universalia, quae in se comprehendunt et {1} sub se concludunt omnia et singula quae sunt Ecclesiae et in universali sensu 
omnia quae sunt regni Domini; universale quod `Reuben' significat est fides; quo haec, nempe fides, sit primum universale, est ex eo quia homo cum {2} regeneratur seu (x)fit Ecclesia, primum discet 
et imbuet illa quae fidei sunt, hoc est, quae veri spiritualis, nam per doctrinam fidei seu veri introducitur; homo enim talis est ut ex se non sciat quid bonum caeleste, {3} sed hoc discet ex 
doctrina, quae doctrina fidei vocatur; [2] omnis {4} doctrina fidei spectat vitam ut finem, et quia vitam, spectat bonum, nam bonum est vitae {5}. Apud antiquos controversum fuit, quodnam primogenitum 
Ecclesiae sit, num verum quod est fidei, vel num bonum quod est amoris; qui verum quod est fidei primogenitum dixerunt, ex apparentia externa concluserunt, et id primogenitum statuerunt quia primum 
discitur et discendum est et quia homo per id introducitur ad bonum; sed nesciverunt quod bonum essentialiter primogenitum sit, et quod id a Domino per internum hominem insinuetur ut adoptet 
et recipiat verum quod per externum introducitur, et quod bono insit vita a Domino, et quod vero nulla vita nisi quae per bonum, sic ut bonum sit anima veri, (c)ac appropriet (c)et induat sibi verum, 
sicut anima corpus; inde constare potest quod secundum apparentiam externam verum primo loco sit, et quasi primogenitum, cum regeneratur homo, tametsi bonum essentialiter primo loco est et primogenitum, 
et fit quoque cum homo regeneratus est; quod ita sit, videatur n. 3539, 3546, 3556, 3563, 3570, 3576, 3603, 3701.  [3] Quia agitur in hoc capite et in illis quae praecedunt, de regeneratione 
naturalis, et hic {6} de primo ejus statu, qui est introductionis per verum ad bonum, ideo primus filius Jacobi seu Reuben nominatus est a `videre Jehovah,' quod in sensu interno significat fidem 
a Domino.  Fides in se spectata est fides intellectu et fides voluntate; scire et intelligere verum quod est fidei, dicitur fides intellectu, at velle verum quod est fidei, dicitur fides voluntate; 
illa, nempe fides intellectu, est quae significatur per `Reuben,' haec autem nempe fides voluntate, est quae significatur per `Shimeonem': quod fides intellectu, seu intelligere verum, praecedat 
fidem voluntate seu velle verum, {7} cuivis constare potest; quod enim homini ignotum est, ut est bonum caeleste, hoc prius scire debet quod sit et intelligere quid sit, antequam id velle potest. 
 [4] Quod videre in sensu externo significet visum, constat absque explicatione; </p>
<p>quod videre {8} in sensu interiore significet intellectum, etiam constare potest, visus enim interni hominis non aliud 
est quam intellectus, quare etiam intellectus in communi loquela vocatur visus internus, et de eo quoque praedicatur lux sicut de visu externo, et vocatur lux intellectualis: quod `videre' in sensu interno 
sit fides a Domino, constat ex eo quod intellectus interior non alia objecta habeat quam illa quae sunt veri et boni, haec enim sunt fidei; interior ille intellectus, seu internus {9} visus, (x)qui 
pro objectis habet vera quae sunt fidei, se non ita manifestat sicut intellectus qui pro objectis habet vera quae sunt vitae civilis et moralis, ex causa quia intra hunc est et in luce caeli, 
quae lux in obscuro est quamdiu homo est in luce mundi; at usque apud illos qui regenerati sunt, se {10} revelat: imprimis per conscientiam.  Quod `videre' in supremo sensu sit praevidentia, constare 
potest, nam intelligentia quae praedicatur de Domino, est intelligentia infinita, quae non aliud est quam praevidentia. [5] Quod per `videre,' ex quo Reuben nominatus est, in sensu interno 
significetur fides a Domino, patet a perplurimis locis in Verbo, quorum haec licet afferre; apud Mosen,      Dixit Jehovah ad Mosen, Fac tibi serpentem, et pone eum super      {11} signo, et erit, 
omnis qui morsus fuerit, et viderit illum      et vivet: fecit Moses serpentem aeris, et posuit eum super      signo {11} et fuit si momordit serpens virum, et inspexit      serpentem aeris revixit, 
Num. xxi 8, 9; </p>
<p>`serpens aeneus' quod repraesentaverit Dominum quoad sensuale externum, seu naturale, videatur n. 197; quod `aes' sit naturale, n. 425, 1551; (x)quod fides in Ipsum repraesentata 
sit per quod revixerint, qui viderunt, seu inspexerunt illum, Ipse Dominus docet apud Johannem      Sicut Moses exaltavit serpentem in deserto, ita oportet      exaltari Filium hominis, ut omnis 
qui credit in Ipsum non      pereat sed vitam aeternam habeat, iii 14, 15: </p>
<p>[6] apud Esaiam,      Dominus dixit, Abi et dic populo huic, Audite audiendo sed non      intelligite, et videte videndo, 
et ne cognoscite, impingua cor      populi hujus, et aures ejus aggrava, et oculos ejus obline, ne      forte videat oculis suis, et auribus suis audiat, et cor ejus      intelligat, vi 9, 10; </p>
<p>quod 
ibi `videre videndo et non cognoscere' sit intelligere quod verum et usque non agnoscere, patet; ac quod `oculos (x)oblinere ne forte videat oculis suis' sit privare intellectu veri, et quod fides 
in Dominum sit quae {12} hic per `videre' significatur, constat a Domini verbis apud Matthaeum xiii 13, 14; et apud Johannem xii 36, 37, 39, 40: [7] apud Ezechielem,      Fili hominis, in medio 
domus rebellionis tu habitans, quibus      oculi ad videndum, sed non vident, quibus aures ad audiendum      et non audiunt, xii 2; </p>
<p>{13} quod `oculi ad videndum sed non vident' pro quod possint intelligere 
vera quae fidei, sed non volunt, et hoc propter mala, quae sunt `domus rebellionis,' quae mendacem lucem falsis et tenebras veris inducunt, secundum haec apud Esaiam,      Populus rebellionis 
ille, filii mendaces, filii non voluerunt      audire legem Jehovae, qui dixerunt videntibus, Ne videatis; et      visionem habentibus, Ne videatis nobis recta, loquimini nobis      blanditias, 
videte illusiones, xxx 9, 10: </p>
<p>apud Esaiam,      Populus hic ambulantes in tenebris viderunt lucem magnam,      habitantes in terra umbrae mortis, lux effulsit super eos, ix      1 (A.V.2) `videre 
lucem magnam' pro vera quae sunt fidei, recipere et credere, super illos qui in fide sunt, `lux' caelestis dicitur `effulgere,' nam lux quae in caelo, est Divinum Verum a Divino Bono {14}: [8] 
apud eundem,      Effudit super vos Jehovah spiritum somnolentiae, et occlusit      oculos vestros, prophetas, et capita vestra, videntes,      obtexit, xxix 10; </p>
<p>`occludere oculos' pro intellectum 
veri; quod oculus sit intellectus, videatur n. 2701; `videntes obtegere' pro illos qui sciunt et docent vera fidei; `videntes' olim dicti sunt prophetae, qui quod sint docentes, tum vera doctrinae, 
videatur n. 2534 apud eundem,      Sacerdos et propheta errant per siceram,... errant inter      videntes, titubant judicio, xxviii 7; </p>
<p>similiter; quod judicium quo titubant, sit verum fidei, videatur 
n. 2235: apud eundem,      Non connivebunt oculi videntium, et aures audientium      auscultabunt, xxxii 3; </p>
<p>similiter: apud eundem,      Regem in pulchritudine sua spectabunt oculi tui, videbunt  
    terram longinquitatum, xxxiii 17; </p>
<p>`spectare regem in pulchritudine' pro vera fidei quae a Domino, quae pulchra dicuntur a bono; `videre terram longinquitatum' pro bonum amoris; quod `rex' 
sit verum fidei, videatur n. 1672, 2015, 2069, {15}, 3009, 3670; quod `pulchrum' dicatur a bono, n. 553, 3080, 3821; quod `terra' sit bonum amoris, n. 620, 636, 3368, 3379 apud Matthaeum,     
 Beati mundi corde, quia hi ipsi Deum videbunt, v 8; </p>
<p>`videre Deum' quod sit credere in Ipsum, ita fide Ipsum videre, patet; qui enim in fide sunt, ex fide vident Deum, nam Deus est in fide, et Deus 
id in fide quod vere fides est: [10] apud eundem,      Si oculus tuus scandalizaverit te, erue (c)illum,... bonum est      tibi luscum intrare in vitam quam duos habentem oculos mitti      in gehennam 
ignis, xviii 9; </p>
<p>hic quod `oculus' non sit oculus, nec quod is eruendus, patet, is enim non scandalizat, sed intellectus veri, qui hic est `oculus,' n. 2701; quod melius sit non scire et capere 
vera fidei, quam scire et capere illa, et usque vivere vitam mali, significatur per `bonum esse {16} luscum intrare in vitam quam duos habentem oculos mitti in gehennam ignis': [11] apud eundem,  
    Vestri beati sunt oculi quia vident, et aures vestrae quia      audiunt: amen dico vobis, quod multi prophetae et justi      desideraverint videre quae videtis, sed non viderunt, xiii      13-17; 
Joh. xii 40; </p>
<p>`videre' pro scire et intelligere illa quae sunt fidei in Dominum, ita pro fide; nam quod viderint Dominum, et viderint miracula Ipsius, non inde beati fuerunt, sed quod crediderint, 
ut constare potest ab his verbis apud Johannem, Dixi vobis, quod et videritis Me, et non credatis; haec est voluntas Ipsius Qui misit Me, ut omnis qui videt Filium, et credit in Ipsum, habeat vitam 
aeternam: </p>
<p>non quod Patrem viderit quis, nisi qui est apud Patrem, hic vidit Patrem; amen, amen, dico vobis, qui credit in Me, habet vitam aeternam, vi 36, 40, 46, 47; `videre et non credere' pro 
scire vera fidei et non recipere, `videre et credere' pro scire illa et recipere; quod `non Patrem viderit quis nisi qui apud Patrem' pro quod non agnosci possit Divinum Bonum nisi per Divinum Verum; 
quod `Pater' sit Divinum Bonum et `Filius' Divinum Verum, videatur n. 3704; inde sensus internus est quod nemo caeleste bonum possit habere nisi agnoscat Dominum: [12] similiter apud eundem,  
    Deum nemo vidit usquam {17}, Unigenitus Filius, Qui in sinu      Patris est, Ille exposuit, i 18: </p>
<p>et apud eundem,      Jesus dixit, Qui videt Me, videt Illum, Qui misit Me; Ego Lux      in mundum 
veni, ut omnis qui credit in Me, in tenebris non      maneat, xii 45, 46; </p>
<p>ibi quod `videre' sit credere seu fidem habere, manifeste dicitur: </p>
<p>et apud eundem,      Jesus dixit, Qui cognovistis 
Me, etiam Patrem Meum      cognovistis, et abhinc cognovistis Illum, et vidistis      Illum,... qui (x)vidit Me, vidit Patrem, xiv 7, 9: </p>
<p>apud eundem,      Spiritum veritatis mundus non potest recipere, 
quoniam non      videt illum neque cognoscit illum:... non relinquam vos      orphanos, venio ad vos, adhuc parum dum mundus Me non amplius      videbit, vos autem videbitis Me, quia Ego vivo, 
et vos      vivetis, xiv 17-19; </p>
<p>`videre' pro fidem habere, solum enim per fidem videtur Dominus, fides enim est {18} oculus amoris, nam ab amore per fidem videtur Dominus, est amor {19} vita fidei, 
quare dicitur, `vos videbitis Me, quia Ego vivo et vos vivetis': [13] apud eundem,      Dixit Jesus, In judicium Ego in mundum hunc veni, ut non      videntes videant, videntes vero caeci fiant; 
Pharisaei...      dixerunt, Num etiam nos caeci sumus? dixit illis Jesus, Si      caeci essetis, non haberetis peccatum, jam vero dicitis quod      videmus, ideo peccatum vestrum manet, ix 39-41; </p>
<p>videntes' 
pro illis qui putant se intelligentes esse prae reliquis, de quibus dicitur quod `caeci fient,' hoc est, non accepturi fidem; </p>
<p>quod `non videre' seu caecus esse praedicetur de illis qui in falsis, 
tum de illis qui in ignorantia, videatur n. 2383: apud Lucam,      Vobis datum est cognoscere mysteria regni Dei, reliquis vero      in parabolis, ut videntes non videant, et audientes non  
    audiant, viii 10; </p>
<p>similiter: apud eundem,      Dico vobis vere, Sunt quidam hic stantium, qui non gustabunt      mortem, donec viderint regnum Dei, ix 27; Marc. ix 1; </p>
<p>`videre regnum Dei' 
pro credere: apud eundem,      Jesus dixit ad discipulos, Venient dies, cum desiderabitis      unum dierum Filii hominis videre, sed non videbitis, xvii 22; </p>
<p>ibi de consummatione saeculi, seu de ultimo 
tempore Ecclesiae, quando non amplius aliqua fides: [14] apud eundem,      Factum est cum Jesus accumberet cum illis, accipiens panem      benedixit, et frangens tradidit illis, illorum autem aperti  
    sunt oculi, et cognoverunt Ipsum, xxiv 30, 31; </p>
<p>per hoc significatum est quod Dominus per bonum appareat, non autem per verum absque bono; `panis' enim est bonum amoris, n. 276, 680, 2165, 
2177, 3478, 3735, 3813. (s)Ex his et pluribus aliis locis constat quod `videre' in sensu interno sit fides a Domino, nam non alia datur fides quae est fides, quam quae a Domino, haec quoque {20} 
dat hominem videre, hoc est, credere; fides autem a se, seu a proprio hominis {21} non est fides, nam haec facit videre falsa ut vera, et vera ut falsa, et si vera ut vera, usque non videt quia non 
credit, videt enim se in illis, non autem Dominum.  [15] Quod `videre' sit fidem habere in Dominum, (x)patet manifeste ab illis quae de luce caeli saepius dicta sunt, quod nempe lux caeli quia est 
a Domino, secum habeat intelligentiam et sapientiam; proinde fidem in Ipsum, nam fides in Dominum intus in intelligentia et sapientia est, quapropter videre ex illa luce, sicut vident angeli non 
aliud potest significare quam fidem in Dominum; est etiam Ipse Dominus in luce illa quia procedit a Domino; illa lux etiam est quae lucet in conscientia illorum qui fidem in Ipsum habent, tametsi homo 
hoc nescit quamdiu in corpore vivit, nam tunc lux mundi illam lucem obscurat. (s) @1 aut$ @2 dum$ @3 et$ @4 i enim$ @5 vita I$ @6 ac$ @7 i quod est fidei$ @8 autem$ @9 intimus$ @10 before
