<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第488节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>488.</strong>“日子”（days）表总体状态，“年岁”（years）表具体状态，这从圣言中可以看出来。如以西结书：<br />使你的日子临近，你的年岁（years）来到。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结22.4.htm">22:4</a>）<br />论到那些行可憎的事和恶贯满盈者，其总体状态用“日子”表述，具体状态则用“年”表述。所以诗篇上说：<br />你要加添王的日子，他的年岁必存到世世。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗61.6.htm">61:6</a>）<br />论到主和祂的王国，“日子”和“年岁“也表其王国的状态。又如：<br />我追想古时之日，上古之年。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗77.5.htm">77:5</a>）<br />“古时之日”表上古教会的状态，“上古之年”表古教会的状态。以赛亚书：<br />报仇之日在我心中，救赎我民之年已经来到。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.4.htm">63:4</a>）<br />论到末期，“报仇之日”表诅咒的状态，而“救赎之年”则表祝福的状态。类似地，在同一先知书:<br />报告主的恩年，和我们神报仇的日子；安慰一切悲哀的人。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛61.2.htm">61:2</a>）<br />此处的“日”与“年”皆表状态。耶利米哀歌：<br />“复新我们的日子，像古时一样。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀5.21.htm">5:21</a>）<br />此处明显指状态。<br />②在约珥书：<br />耶和华的日子将到，已经临近；那日是黑暗、幽冥的日子，是密云、乌黑的日子；从来没有这样的，以后直到万代也必没有。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.1.htm">2:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.2.htm">2</a>）<br />这里的“日子”表黑暗、幽冥、密云、乌黑的状态，无论是具体的每一个，还是总体的全部。撒迦利亚书：<br />我要在一日之内除掉这地的罪孽；当那日，你们各人要请邻舍坐在葡萄树和无花果树下。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚3.9.htm">3:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚3.10.htm">10</a>）<br />那日，必是耶和华所知道的，不是白昼，也不是黑夜，到了晚上才有光明。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚14.7.htm">14:7</a>）<br />此处很明显指的是状态，因为经不上说，那日“不是白昼，也不是黑夜，到了晚上才有光明”。从以下十诫可以看出同样的意思：<br />当孝敬父母，使你的日子在耶和华你神所赐你的地上得以长久。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申5.16.htm">5:16</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申25.15.htm">25:15</a>）<br />“日子得以长久”并非寿命长，而是指幸福的状态。<br />③从字面上看，“日子”似乎应表时间，但就内义而言，它表状态。处于内义的天使并不知道什么时间，因为他们没有分别时间的太阳和月亮，因而也不知道何为年、日，只知道状态及其变化。所以在处于内义的天使面前，关乎物质、空间和时间的一切皆不复存在，如以西结书这节经文的字义：<br />那日子临近了，耶和华的日子临近了，就是密云之日，是列国受罚之期。（以西结书３０：３）<br />对此，在约珥书：<br />哀哉！耶和华的日子临近了，好像荒废临到。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥1.15.htm">1:15</a>）<br />“密云之日”表云或虚假；“列国之期”表列国或罪恶；“耶和华的日子”表荒废。当去除时间的概念后，就会留有存于那时事物状态的概念。本章频频提及的“日子”与“年”同样如此。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]488.</strong> The symbolism of days as general states and of years as specific states can also be seen in the Word, as I said [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_488/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_482" target=_top>482</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_488/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_487" target=_top>487</a>]. Take these words in Ezekiel:<br />You have made [the end of] your days approach and have come all the way to [the end of] your years. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_488/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_22_4" target=_top>Ezekiel 22:4</a>)<br />This is about people who do loathsome things and fill their quota of sin, so in regard to the state of such people, days describes its general outlines and years its specific nature. In David:<br />You will add days to the monarch's days; the monarch's years will be like those of generation after generation. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_488/bible_king-james-version_psalms_61_6" target=_top>Psalms 61:6</a>)<br />This is about the Lord and his kingdom. The days and years stand for the state of his kingdom. In the same author:<br />I thought about the ancient days, the years of old. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_488/bible_king-james-version_psalms_77_5" target=_top>Psalms 77:5</a>)<br />The ancient days are the states of the earliest church, and the years of old are the states of the ancient church. In Isaiah:<br />The day of vengeance is in my heart, and the year of my redeemed has come. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_488/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_63_4" target=_top>Isaiah 63:4</a>)<br />This stands for the final times; the day of vengeance stands for a state of damnation, and the year of the redeemed, for a state of blessing. In similar words from the same author:<br />... to proclaim a year of good pleasure for Jehovah and a day of vengeance for our God, to comfort all who mourn. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_488/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_61_2" target=_top>Isaiah 61:2</a>)<br />Here again, both the word day and the word year are used, and they symbolize states. In Jeremiah:<br />Renew our days as in ancient times. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_488/bible_king-james-version_lamentations_5_21" target=_top>Lamentations 5:21</a>)<br />Here the days obviously stand for the state of those people.<br />[2] In Joel:<br />The day of Jehovah has come, because it is near: a day of shadow and darkness, a day of cloud and haze. One like it has not occurred for ages, and after it one will not occur again for the years of generation after generation. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_488/bible_king-james-version_joel_2_1-2" target=_top>Joel 2:1-2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_488/bible_king-james-version_joel_2_11" target=_top>11</a>)<br />Here a day stands for a state of shadow, darkness, cloud, and haze for each person in particular and everyone in general. In Zechariah:<br />I will carry off the wickedness of that land in one day. On that day you will shout, a man to his companion, to [come] under the grapevine and under the fig tree. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_488/bible_king-james-version_zechariah_3_9-10" target=_top>Zechariah 3:9-10</a>)<br />And in another place:<br />There will be a single day; it is known to Jehovah; it is not day or night. And it will happen that at the time of evening there will be light. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_488/bible_king-james-version_zechariah_14_7" target=_top>Zechariah 14:7</a>)<br />Plainly this is about some state [of mind], because it says that there will be a day that is not day or night, and that there will be light at the time of evening.{*1} Statements in the Ten Commandments provide further evidence:<br />Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be lengthened and so that it may be well with you upon the ground. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_488/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_5_16" target=_top>Deuteronomy 5:16</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_488/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_25_15" target=_top>25:15</a>)<br />The lengthening of days does not symbolize long life but a happy state.<br />[3] On a literal level, no other meaning for a day can be seen than that of time, but in an inner sense it means a state. Angels, who focus on the inner meaning of the Word, do not know what time is. They have no sun or moon to divide time into units, so they do not know what a day or a year is, only what a state and changes in state are.{*2} For this reason, whatever partakes of matter, space, or time dissolves under the gaze of angels alive to the Word's inner meaning. The literal sense of these words from Ezekiel does so, for instance:<br />The day is near; yes, the day of Jehovah is near. The time of the nations will be a day of cloud. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_488/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_30_3" target=_top>Ezekiel 30:3</a>)<br />And from Joel:<br />Oh my, the day! For the day of Jehovah is near, and [it comes] as devastation. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_488/bible_king-james-version_joel_1_15" target=_top>Joel 1:15</a>)<br />The day of cloud stands for a cloud, or in other words, falsity. The day of the nations stands for the nations, or in other words, wickedness.{*3} The day of Jehovah stands for devastation. When the notion of time is laid aside, there remains the notion of the state that things were in at that time. The situation is the same for the days and years mentioned so frequently in this chapter.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} In other words, since the literal meaning is paradoxical, there must be another meaning. [LHC]<br />{*2} For more on this subject, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_488/swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_162" target=_top>Heaven and Hell 162-169</a>. Swedenborg's footnotes at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_488/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_165" target=_top>165</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_488/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_167" target=_top>167</a> there give extensive references back to various topics relating to state and time in Secrets of Heaven. [RS, SS]<br />{*3} Swedenborg assigns negative connotation to "the nations" in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_488/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_139" target=_top>139</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_488/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_249" target=_top>249</a> as well. In later sections, such as 1025:7, he sometimes assigns this expression a positive connotation. [LHC] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 488</b></p><p><b>488.</b>
That "days" signify states in general, and "years" states in special, appears from the Word, as in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years (Ezek. 22:4), speaking 
of those who commit abominations, and fill up the measure of their sins, of whose state in general are predicated "days" and in special "years." So in David: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt add days to the 
days of the king, and his years as of generation and generation (Ps. 61:6), speaking of the Lord and of His kingdom, where also "days" and "years" signify the state of His kingdom. Again: </p>
<p>     I 
have considered the days of old" the years of the ages (Ps. 77:5), where "days of old" signify states of the Most Ancient Church, and "years of the ages" states of the Ancient Church. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>   
  The day of vengeance is in My heart, and the year of My redeemed is come (Isa. 63:4), speaking of the last times, where the "day of vengeance" signifies a state of damnation, and the "year of the redeemed" 
a state of blessedness. Again: </p>
<p>     To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn (Isa. 61:2), where both "days" and "years" signify 
states. In Jeremiah: Renew our days as of old (Lam. 5:21), where state is plainly meant.  [2] In Joel: </p>
<p>     The day of Jehovah cometh, for it is nigh at hand, a day of darkness and of thick darkness, 
a day of cloud and of obscurity; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be after it, even to the years of generation and generation (Joel 2:1-2), where "day" signifies a state of darkness 
and of thick darkness, of cloud and of obscurity, with each one in particular, and with all in general. In Zechariah:     I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day; in that day shall 
ye cry a man to his companion under the vine, and under the fig tree (Zech. 3:9-10). And in another place: </p>
<p>     It shall be one day which is known to Jehovah, not day nor night, and it shall come to 
pass that at evening time it shall be light (Zech. 14:7), where it is plain that state is meant, for it is said that there shall be a day that is "neither day nor night, at evening time it shall be 
light." The same appears from expressions in the Decalogue: </p>
<p>     Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may be well with thee upon the ground (Deut. 5:16; 25:15), where 
to have the "days prolonged" does not signify length of life, but a happy state.  [3] In the literal sense it must needs appear as if "day" signifies time, but in the internal sense it signifies 
state. The angels, who are in the internal sense, do not know what time is, for they have no sun and moon that distinguish times; consequently they do not know what days and years are, but only what 
states are and the changes thereof; and therefore before the angels, who are in the internal sense, everything relating to matter, space, and time disappears, as in the literal sense of this passage 
in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     The day is near, even the day of Jehovah is near, a day of cloud; it shall be the time of the nations (Ezek. 30:3), and of this in Joel: </p>
<p>     Alas for the day for the day of Jehovah 
is at hand, and as vastation shall it come (Joel 1:15), where a "day of cloud" signifies a cloud, or falsity; the "day of the nations" signifies the nations, or wickedness; the "day of Jehovah" 
signifies vastation. When the notion of time is removed, there remains the notion of the state of the things which existed at that time. The case is the same with regard to the "days" and "years" that 
are so often mentioned in this chapter. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 488</b></p><p><b>488.</b>
As has been stated, 'days' means states in general, and 'years' states in particular. This too becomes clear from the Word, as in Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
You have brought your days near, and you have come even 
to your years. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2022:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 22:4</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to people who behave abominably and sin to the fullest extent, and so 'days' has reference in this case to such people's state in general, 'years' to that state 
in particular. In David,  </p>
<blockquote>
 You will add days to the king's days; and his years as generation after generation! <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2061:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 61:6</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord and His kingdom, where again 'days' and 'years' 
stand for the state of His kingdom. In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
I have considered the days of old, the years of long ago. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2077:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 77:5</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'days of old' is states of the Most Ancient Church, and 'years 
of long ago' states of the Ancient Church. In Isaiah,   The day of vengeance was in My heart, and the year of My redeemed has come. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2063:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 63:4</a>. </p>
<p>This stands for the final times, where 'the day of 
vengeance' stands for a state of condemnation, and 'the year of the redeemed' for a state of blessedness. Similarly, in the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
To proclaim the year of Jehovah's good pleasure, and the 
day of vengeance for our God; to comfort all who mourn. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2061:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 61:2</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here again 'days' and also 'years' are mentioned and mean states. In Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Renew our days as of old. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lam%205:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lam 5:21</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 
'days' plainly stands for state.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In Joel,  </p>
<blockquote>
The day of Jehovah is coming, for it is near, a day of darkness and thick darkness, a tiny of cloud and gloom, as has never happened of old, nor 
will be again after it through the years of generation after generation. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%202:1,%202,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 2:1, 2, 11</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'day' stands for a state of darkness, thick darkness, cloud and gloom - a state of individuals in particular 
and of all in general. In Zechariah,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will remove the iniquity of this land in a single day. On that day you will shout, each to his companion, under his vine and under his fig tree. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%203:9,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 3:9, 10</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere in Zechariah,  </p>
<blockquote>
There will be one tiny, it is known to Jehovah, which is neither day nor night, and at evening time there will be light. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%2014:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 14:7</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>State is clearly 
meant here, for it is said that 'it will be a day, which is neither day nor night; at evening time there will be light'. The same meaning is also clear from the following in the Decalogue,  </p>
<blockquote>
Honour 
your father and your mother, that your days may be prolonged, and that it may be well with you in the land. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%205:16;%2025:75&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 5:16; 25:75</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'a prolonging of days' does not mean living on into old age but 
a state that is happy.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the sense of the letter 'day' cannot be seen to mean anything other than a period of time, but in the internal sense it means a state. Angels, who abide in the internal 
sense of the Word, do not know what a period of time is, for the activity of the sun and moon with them does not produce divisions of time. As a consequence they do not know what a day or a year is, 
but only what states and changes of state are. This is why among angels, who abide in the internal sense of the Word, anything connected with matter, space, and time, goes unnoticed, as with the following 
usages in the sense of the letter in Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
The day is near, even the day of Jehovah is near, a day of cloud; it will be a time of the nations. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2030:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 30:3</a>.   
</blockquote>
And in Joel,  </p>
<blockquote>
Alas for 
the day! For the day of Jehovah is near, and as destruction. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%201:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 1:15</a>.   
</blockquote>
Here 'a day of cloud' stands for cloud or falsity, 'a day of the nations' for the nations or wickedness, and 'the day of Jehovah' 
for vastation. When the concept of time is removed there remains the concept of the state of the things existing during that period of time. The same applies to the days and the years that are mentioned 
so many times in this chapter.

 [3] In sensu litterae non aliter videri potest quam quod 'dies' significet tempus, sed in sensu interno significat statum; angeli, qui in sensu interno Verbi sunt, non sciunt quid tempus, nam 
illis non est sol et luna distinguens tempora, proinde non sciunt quid dies et annus, se quid status et ejus mutationes; quare coram angelis, qui in sensu interno Verbi sunt, quicquid est materiae, spatii 
et temporis, disparet ut quae in sensu litterae apud Ezechielem, 	Propinquus est dies, et propinquus dies Jehovae, dies nubis tempus gentium erit, xxx 3: </p>
<p>et apud Joelem, 	Ah diei, quia propinquus 
dies Jehovae, et sicut vastatio, i 15;  ubi 'dies nubis' pro nube seu falsitate; 'dies gentium' pro gentibus seu malitia; 'dies Jehovae' pro vastatione. Cum temporis noti removetur, manet notio 
status rerum, quae tempore illo fuerunt Similiter se habet cum 'diebus et annis' in hoc capite, qui toties nominantur.
