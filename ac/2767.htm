<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2767节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2767.</strong>“这些话以后”表这些事发生后。这是显而易见的，无需解释。前面已论述了这些事，它们与亚比米勒和亚伯拉罕有关。这二人在别是巴立了约，最后亚伯拉罕在别是巴种植果园，以此表示人类理性概念与本为神性的信之教义联结。此处论述的是主在理性方面所接受的试探，该理性由以撒来表示。因为主通过试探使其人性变成神性，从而使其理性变成神性，人类就始于其理性（<a href="2106.htm">2106</a>，<a href="2194.htm">2194</a>节）。祂使其理性变成神性的方式是：压制并逐出理性当中纯人性的一切事物，即母亲方面的一切事物。本节起到联结上下文的作用，故此处经上说“这些话以后，神要试验亚伯拉罕”。</p>

It came to pass after these words. That this signifies after the things just accomplished, is evident without explication. The things which have been treated of are those respecting Abimelech and Abraham, 
that they made a covenant in Beersheba, and lastly that Abraham raised up a grove in Beersheba, by which was signified that human rational things were adjoined to the doctrine of faith, which is 
in itself Divine. Here now the Lord's temptation as to the rational, which is signified by Isaac, is treated of; for by temptations the Lord made His Human Divine, and thus His rational, in which the 
human commences (n. 2106, 2194), by chastising and expelling all in the rational that was merely human, or the maternal human. This is the connection of the things of the preceding chapter with those 
in this chapter; whence it is said, "It came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham." </p>

That 'so it was after these events' means after these things had taken place is clear without explanation. These things, which have received explanation, are those to do with Abimelech and Abraham's 
making a covenant in Beersheba, and finally with Abraham's establishment of a grove in Beersheba, by which was meant that human rational ideas were allied to the doctrine of faith, which in itself is 
Divine. Now the subject becomes the temptation of the Lord as regards the Rational, meant by Isaac; for by means of temptations the Lord made His Human Divine, and thus His Rational in which the human 
has its beginnings, <a href="2106.htm">2106</a>, <a href="2194.htm">2194</a>. He made it Divine by suppressing and driving out everything in the rational which was merely human, that is, which was the maternal human. The present verse serves as 
the link between the matters dealt with in the previous chapter and those dealt with in this; hence the words that occur here, 'So it was after these events, that God tempted Abraham'. </p>

`Fuit post verba illa: quod significet res transactas, constat absque explicatione. Res de quibus actum est, sunt de Abimelecho et Abrahamo quod foedus pepigerint in Beersheba; et ultimo quod Abraham 
aedificaverit lucum in Beersheba, quibus significatum, quod rationalia humana adjuncta sint doctrinae fidei, quae in se est Divina; hic nunc agitur de tentatione Domini quoad Rationale, quod {1}significatur 
per `Isacum'; per tentationes enim Dominus Humanum Suum, ita Rationale in quo humanum incohat, n. 2106, 2194, Divinum fecit, castigando et expellendo omne quod in rationali mere humanum seu humanum 
maternum fuit; hic est nexus rerum praecedentis capitis cum his quae in hoc capite, unde dicitur, `Fuit post verba illa, et Deus tentavit Abrahamum.' @1 repraesentatur$ </p>
