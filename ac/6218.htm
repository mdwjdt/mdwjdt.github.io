The Internal Sense Verses 1, 2. And it came to pass after these words, that one said unto Joseph, Behold thy father is sick; and he took his two sons with him, Manasseh and Ephraim. And one told Jacob, 
and said, Behold thy son Joseph cometh unto thee; and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed. "And it came to pass after these words," signifies what follows from what has gone before; 
"that one said unto Joseph," signifies an eminent perception; "Behold thy father is sick," signifies what is successive of regeneration; "and he took his two sons with him, Manasseh and Ephraim," signifies 
the will of the church and the intellectual of the church born from the internal; "and one told Jacob," signifies a perception from the truth of the natural; "and said, Behold thy son Joseph cometh 
unto thee," signifies concerning the presence of the internal; "and Israel strengthened himself," signifies new forces through spiritual good; "and sat upon the bed," signifies that this was turned 
to the natural. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE </p>
<p>Verses 1, 2 And so it was after these things, that [someone] said to Joseph, Behold, your father is sick. And he took his two sons with him, Manasseh and Ephraim. And [someone] 
told Jacob and said, Behold, your son Joseph has come to you; and Israel strengthened himself and sat on the bed.  </p>
<p>'And so it was after these things' means what follows as a consequence of the affairs 
prior to this. 'That [someone] said to Joseph' means a preeminent perception. 'Behold, your father is sick' means the next stage towards regeneration. 'And he took his two sons with him, Manasseh 
and Ephraim' means the Church's will and the Church's understanding, born from the internal. 'And [someone] told Jacob' means a discernment by the truth of the natural. 'And said, Behold, your son Joseph 
has come to you' means regarding the presence of the internal. 'And Israel strengthened himself' means new powers received through spiritual good. 'And sat on the bed' means which was turned towards 
the natural. </p>
