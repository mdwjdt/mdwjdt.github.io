<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2093节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2093.</strong>“撒拉必给你生以撒”表与神性良善结合的神性真理，它将从这神性真理而生出。这从“撒拉”和“亚伯拉罕”清楚可知，“撒拉”代表神性真理（参看<a href="2063.htm">2063</a>，<a href="2081.htm">2081</a>节）；“亚伯拉罕”代表神性良善（参看<a href="2063.htm">2063</a>节等）。<br />至于主的第一理性如何孕育和生出，这在论述代表第一理性的“以实玛利”的前一章已予以说明。本章和下一章则论述该理性通过主变成神性，并且这事是通过如同神性良善与神性真理的婚姻那样的结合成就的。第一理性只能通过内在人流入外在人的知识情感而孕育，也只能通过知识情感生出，对知识的情感由撒拉的婢女夏甲来代表，如前一章所示（<a href="1896.htm">1896</a>，<a href="1902.htm">1902</a>，<a href="1910.htm">1910</a>节等）。<br />但是，第二理性或神圣理性的孕育和生出并非以这种方式，而是凭借内在人中真理与良善的结合，以及由此产生的流注。对主而言，这一切是凭源于神性本身，即耶和华的祂自己的能力成就的。前面屡次阐明，祂的内在人就是耶和华，“亚伯拉罕”所代表的良善本身属于内在人，如同“撒拉”所代表的真理本身也属于内在人一样。因此，这二者都变成神性，主的神圣理性就由它们孕育和生出。事实上，它通过良善流入真理、因而凭借这真理而孕育和生出，因为该理性的主要元素是真理，如前所述（<a href="2072.htm">2072</a>节）。所以，此处经上说“撒拉必给你生以撒”，它表示与良善结合的神性真理，神圣理性从神性真理而出。17节经文说，撒拉是“九十岁的女儿”，它表示与良善结合的真理必成就这一切。<br />对所有人而言，由于每个人都被造为神的样式和形像，故会有类似但不可相提并论的事发生，也就是说，人的第一理性也是通过他的内在人流入其外在人中知识情感的生命而孕育和生出的。他在重生时，便从主接受这第二理性，因为那时，他以其理性觉察何为信之良善与真理。对人而言，内在人在他的理性之上，是主的（参看<a href="1889.htm">1889</a>，<a href="1940.htm">1940</a>节）。</p>

Whom Sarah shall bear unto thee. That this signifies the Divine truth conjoined with the Divine good, from which it will come forth, is evident from the representation of "Sarah," as being the Divine 
truth (spoken of before, n. 2063, 2081); and from the representation of "Abraham," as being the Divine good (treated of, n. 2063, and in several other places).  [2] How the Lord's first rational was 
conceived and born, has been stated in the foregoing chapter, where "Ishmael" is treated of, by whom that rational was represented. But here, and also in the following chapter, that rational is treated 
of which was made Divine by the Lord, and this by the conjunction, as by marriage, of the Divine good with the Divine truth. The first rational cannot be conceived otherwise than by the influx of the 
internal man into the affection of memory-knowledges in the external man; nor can it be born otherwise than from the affection of memory-knowledges, which was represented by Hagar, Sarah's handmaid 
(as shown in the preceding chapter, n. 1896, 1902, 1910, etc.).  [3] But the second or Divine rational is not conceived and born in this way, but by means of the conjunction of the truth of the internal 
man with the good of the same, and the influx thence derived. With the Lord this was effected of His own proper power from the Divine itself, that is, from Jehovah. As has been repeatedly stated 
above, His internal man was Jehovah; and the good itself that was represented by Abraham belonged to His internal man, as also did the truth itself that was represented by Sarah, and therefore both were 
Divine. From this source therefore was the Lord's Divine rational conceived and born; and in fact from the influx of the good into the truth, and thus by means of the truth; for the chief characteristic 
of the rational is truth (as before said, n. 2072). On this account it is here said, "whom Sarah shall bear unto thee," which signifies Divine truth conjoined with Good, from which that Divine rational 
will come forth; and above (at verse 17) it was said that Sarah was a "daughter of ninety years," which signifies that the truth conjoined with good shall do this.  [4] With every man whatever 
because he has been created in the likeness and image of God, the like, but not the equal of this takes place, that is to say, his first rational is also conceived and born by means of the influx of 
his internal man into the life of the affection of memory-knowledges in his external man; but his second rational, from the influx of the good and truth from the Lord through his internal man. This second 
rational he receives from the Lord when he is being regenerated, for he then perceives in his rational what the good and the truth of faith are. In man the internal man is above his rational, and 
is the Lord's (see n. 1889, 1940). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2093</b></p><p><b>2093.</b>
'Whom Sarah will bear to you' means Divine Truth joined to Divine Good from which it will come forth into being. This is clear from the representation of 'Sarah' as Divine Truth, dealt with already in <a href="2063.htm">2063</a>, <a href="2081.htm">2081</a>, and from the representation of 'Abraham' as Divine Good, dealt with in <a href="2063.htm">2063</a> and in various places elsewhere. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The manner in which the Lord's first rational was conceived and born has 
been stated in the previous chapter where Ishmael, who represented that rational, was the subject. This chapter and the next deal with that Rational which was made Divine by the Lord, something He 
achieved through the marriage-like conjunction of Divine Good with Divine Truth. The only possible way the first rational can be conceived is by the influx of the Internal Man into the External Man's 
affection for knowledge. Nor can it be born from anything other than the affection for knowledge, an affection represented by 'Hagar, Sarai's servant-girl', as shown in the previous chapter, in <a href="1896.htm">1896</a>, 
<a href="1902.htm">1902</a>, <a href="1910.htm">1910</a>, and elsewhere in that chapter. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But the second or Divine Rational is not conceived and born in the same way but by the conjunction of Truth in the Internal Man with Good in the same, 
and the resulting influx. In the Lord's case this was achieved by His own power derived from the Divine itself, that is, from Jehovah. As stated in various places already, His Internal Man was Jehovah. 
And Good itself, represented by 'Abraham', belonged to the Internal Man, as also did Truth itself, represented by 'Sarah'. Both were on that account Divine, and from them both the Lord's Divine Rational 
was conceived and born. Indeed it was conceived and born from the influx of good into truth, and so by means of truth, for the principal element in the rational is truth, as stated above in <a href="2072.htm">2072</a>. 
Hence the statement here 'whom Sarah will bear to you', which means Divine Truth joined to Good from which it will come into being, and at verse 17 above the statement 'Sarah a daughter of ninety years' 
means that Truth joined to Good will accomplish this. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 With all human beings, since each has been created in the likeness and image of God, something similar yet not comparable takes place, 
in that his first rational too is conceived and born through the influx of his internal man into the life of his external man's affection for knowledge, but his second rational results from the influx 
of good and truth from the Lord by way of his internal man. This second rational he receives from the Lord when he is being regenerated, for at that time he senses within his rational what the good 
and truth of faith are. The internal man with anyone is above his rational, and is the Lord's. This is dealt with in <a href="1889.htm">1889</a>,<a href="1940.htm">1940</a>. </p>

`Quem pariet tibi Sarah': quod significet Divinum Verum conjunctum Divino Bono ex quo existet, constat ex repraesentatione `Sarah' quod sit Divinum Verum, de qua prius n. 2063, 2081, et ex repraesentatione 
`Abrahami' quod sit Divinum Bonum, de qua n. 2063, et passim alibi: [2] quomodo rationale primum {1} Domini conceptum et natum sit, in capite praecedente dictum est, ubi de Ismaele per quem rationale 
illud repraesentatum est; hic nunc et in sequenti capite agitur de Rationali illo quod Divinum factum a Domino, et hoc per conjunctionem, sicut per conjugium, Divini Boni cum Divino Vero; rationale 
primum non aliter concipi potest quam per influxum Interni Hominis in affectionem scientiarum Externi, nec aliter nasci quam ab affectione scientiarum, quae repraesentata est per `Hagarem ancillam 
Sarai,' ut ostensum in capite praecedente, n. 1896, 1902, 1910, et alibi ibi; [3] sed Rationale alterum seu Divinum, non ita concipitur et nascitur, sed per conjunctionem Veri Interni Hominis cum Bono 
ejusdem, et inde influxum; apud Dominum ex propria potentia ex Ipso Divino, hoc est, Jehovah; Internus Ipsius Homo fuit, ut prius passim dictum, Jehovah; et ipsum Bonum, repraesentatum per `Abraham,' 
fuit Interni Hominis, tum ipsum Verum, repraesentatum per `Sarah,' etiam fuit Interni Hominis, ita utrumque Divinum; inde nunc Rationale Divinum Domini conceptum et natum; (m)et quidem ex influxu 
boni in verum, ita per verum, rationalis enim praecipuum est verum, ut supra n. 2072 dictum; quare hic dicitur `quem pariet tibi Sarah,' quod significat Divinum Verum conjunctum Bono ex quo existet; et 
supra ad vers. 17 quod `Sarah filia nonaginta annorum' significet quod Verum conjunctum Bono hoc faciet.(n)  [4] Apud hominem quemcumque quia ad similitudinem et imaginem Dei creatus [est,] simile sed 
non compar existit, nempe quod rationale ejus primum etiam per influxum interni ejus hominis in vitam affectionis scientiarum externi ejus, concipiatur et nascatur, sed rationale ejus alterum, ex influxu 
boni et veri a Domino per internum ejus hominem; rationale hoc alterum accipit a Domino cum regeneratur, nam tunc in rationali suo sentit quid bonum et verum fidei: internus homo apud hominem est 
supra ejus rationale, estque Domini, de quo n. 1889, 1940. 	@1 A. had Rationale humanum Domini ip primum seu above, but humanum is then deleted.$ </p>
