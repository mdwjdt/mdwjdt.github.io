From what has been said it may be seen what hidden things the Word has stored within it; which can by no means come to anyone's knowledge except from the internal sense.            GENESIS 24 </p>
<p>  
   1. And Abraham being old was come into days; and Jehovah blessed Abraham in all things.      2. And Abraham said unto his servant, the elder of his house, who administered all that he had, Put I pray 
thy hand under my thigh.      3. And I will make thee swear by Jehovah the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a woman for my son of the daughters of the Canaanite, in 
the midst of whom I dwell; </p>
<p>     4. But thou shalt go unto my land, and to my nativity; and take a woman for my son for Isaac.      5. And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not 
be willing to follow me unto this land; bringing shall I bring back thy son unto the land whence thou camest out?      6. And Abraham said unto him, Beware that thou bring not back my son thither.  
    7. Jehovah the God of heaven, that took me from my father's house, and from the land of my nativity, and that spoke unto me, and that swear unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land, He 
shall send His angel before thee, and thou shalt take a woman for my son from thence.      8. And if the woman be not willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this mine oath; only thou 
shalt not bring back my son thither.      9. And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his lord, and sware to him concerning this word.      10. And the servant took ten camels, of the 
camels of his lord, and departed, and every good of his lord was in his hand; and he arose and went to Aram-naharaim, unto the city of Nahor.      11. And he made the camels kneel down, without the 
city, by the well of waters, about the time of evening, about the time the drawers go out.      12. And he said, O Jehovah God of my lord Abraham, cause to meet I pray before me this day; and do mercy 
with my lord Abraham.      13. Behold, I stand by the fountain of waters; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw waters.      14. And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom 
I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink, and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also, her hast Thou appointed for Thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I 
know that Thou hast done mercy with my lord.      15. And it came to pass that scarcely had he done speaking, when behold Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, 
Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.      16. And the damsel was exceeding good to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her; and she went down to the fountain, and filled 
her pitcher, and came up.      17. And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me I pray sip a little water from thy pitcher.      18. And she said, Drink, my lord; and she hasted, and let down 
her pitcher upon her hand, and made him drink.      19. And she finished making him drink, and she said, I will draw for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.      20. And she hasted, and 
emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.      21. And the man marveling at her, withheld himself, to know whether Jehovah had prospered 
his way or not.      22. And it came to pass when the camels had done drinking, that the man took a jewel of gold, of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands, ten of gold their weight.  
    23. And he said, Whose daughter art thou? Tell me I pray is there room in thy father's house for us to pass the night?      24. And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of 
Milcah, whom she bare unto Nahor.      25. And she said unto him, We have both straw and much provender, also room to pass the night.      26. And the man bent himself, and bowed himself down to Jehovah.  
    27. And he said, Blessed be Jehovah the God of my lord Abraham, who hath not forsaken His mercy and His truth from my lord. I being in the way, Jehovah hath led me to the house of my lord's 
brethren.      28. And the damsel ran, and told her mother's house according to these words.      29. And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban; and Laban ran out of doors unto the man, unto 
the fountain.      30. And it came to pass when he saw the jewel, and the bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spoke the man unto me, 
that he came unto the man; and behold he stood by the camels at the fountain.      31. And he said, Come thou blessed of Jehovah, wherefore standest thou without? For I have swept the house, and there 
is room for the camels.      32. And the man came into the house, and loosed the camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the feet of the men that were with 
him.      33. And there was set before him to eat; and he said, I will not eat until I have spoken my words. And he said, Speak.      34. And he said, I am Abraham's servant.      35. And Jehovah 
hath blessed my lord exceedingly, and hath made him great, and hath given him flock and herd, and silver and gold, and menservants and maidservants, and camels and asses.      36. And Sarah, my lord's 
wife, bare a son to my lord after she was old; and he hath given unto him all that he hath.      37. And my lord made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a woman for my son of the daughters of 
the Canaanite, in whose land I dwell.      38. But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my family, and take a woman for my son.      39. And I said unto my lord, Peradventure the woman will 
not follow me.      40. And he said unto me, Jehovah, before whom I have walked, will send His angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a woman for my son from my family, and from my 
father's house.      41. Then shalt thou be clear from my oath, when thou comest to my family; and if they give not to thee, thou shalt be clear from my oath.      42. And I came this day unto the 
fountain, and said, O Jehovah God of my lord Abraham, if now Thou do prosper my way wherein I do walk; </p>
<p>     43. Behold I stand by the fountain of waters; and let it come to pass that the maiden which 
cometh forth to draw, and to whom I shall say, Let me drink I pray a little water from thy pitcher; </p>
<p>     44. And she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels, let her be 
the woman whom Jehovah hath appointed for my lord's son.      45. I scarcely had done speaking in mine heart, when behold Rebekah came forth; and her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto 
the fountain and drew; and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray.      46. And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from upon her, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also; and I drank, 
and she gave drink to the camels also.      47. And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, the son of Nahor, whom Milcah bare unto him. And I put 
the jewel upon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands.      48. And I bent and bowed myself down to Jehovah, and blessed Jehovah God of my lord Abraham, who led me into the way of truth, to take 
the daughter of my lord's brother for his son.      49. And now if ye will do mercy and truth with my lord, tell me; and if not, tell me; and I will look to the right hand, or to the left.      50. 
And Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The word hath gone forth from Jehovah; we cannot speak unto thee evil or good.      51. Behold Rebekah is before thee; take her, and go, and let her be the woman 
of thy lord's son, as Jehovah hath spoken.      52. And it came to pass that when Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth unto Jehovah.      53. And the servant 
brought forth vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and garments, and gave to Rebekah; he gave also precious things to her brother and to her mother.      54. And they did eat and drink, he and the 
men that were with him; and they passed the night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my lord.      55. And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us 
days, at least ten; afterwards thou shalt go.      56. And he said unto them, Do not delay me, and Jehovah hath prospered my way; send me away, and I will go to my lord.      57. And they said, Let 
us call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.      58. And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.      59. And they sent away Rebekah their sister, 
and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.      60. And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Our sister, be thou for thousands of ten thousands; and may thy seed inherit the gate of those 
that hate thee.      61. And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man; and the servant took Rebekah, and went away.      62. And Isaac came from coming 
from Beer-lahai-roi; and he dwelt in the land of the south.      63. And Isaac went out to meditate in the field toward evening; and he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold there were camels coming.  
    64. And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and saw Isaac, and she alighted from off the camel.      65. And she said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the 
servant said, It is my lord. And she took a veil and covered herself.      66. And the servant told Isaac all the words that he had done.      67. And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent; 
and he took Rebekah, and she was to him for a woman, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother. </p>

</blockquote>
<p> <LI value='4'> But that you go 
to my land and to the place of my nativity; and you shall take a wife for my son Isaac. </p>
<p><LI value='5'> And the servant said to him, Perhaps the woman is not willing to go after me to this land: Must I take your 
son back to the land from which you came? </p>
<p><LI value='6'> And Abraham said to him, Beware that you do not by any chance take my son back there. </p>
<p><LI value='7'> Jehovah, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house 
and from the land of my nativity, and who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, To your seed I will give this land, He will send His angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from 
there. </p>
<p><LI value='8'> And if the woman is not willing to go after you, you are clear from this my oath; only do not take my son back there. </p>
<p><LI value='9'> And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, 
and swore to him concerning this matter. </p>
<p><LI value='10'> And the servant took ten camels from his master's camels, and went; and every good thing that was his master's was in his hand; and he rose up and went 
to Aram Naharaim, to the city of Nahor. </p>
<p><LI value='11'> And he made the camels kneel down outside and away from the city near a well of water, at evening time, at the time that women go out to draw water. </p>
<p><LI value='12'> 
And he said, O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, make it go right for me today<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> and deal mercifully with my master Abraham. </p>
<p><LI value='13'> Behold, I am standing beside a spring of water and the daughters 
of the men of the city are coming out to draw water. </p>
<p><LI value='14'> And let it be that the girl to whom I say, Let down now your pitcher and I will drink, and she says, Drink, and also I will give your camels 
a drink - let her be the one whom You have appointed for Your servant Isaac. And in this I shall know that You have dealt mercifully with my master. </p>
<p><LI value='15'> And so it was, before he had finished speaking, 
that behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, the son of Milkah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother; and her pitcher was on her shoulder. </p>
<p><LI value='16'> And the girl was very good looking, a 
virgin, and no man had known her. And she went down to the spring, and filled her pitcher, and went up. </p>
<p><LI value='17'> And the servant ran to meet her and said, Let me sip now a little water from your pitcher. </p>
<p><LI value='18'> 
And she said, Drink, my lord. And she hastened and lowered her pitcher on to her hand and gave him a drink. </p>
<p><LI value='19'> And she finished giving him the drink and said, I will draw for your camels also 
until they have finished drinking. </p>
<p><LI value='20'> And she hastened and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw, and drew for all his camels. </p>
<p><LI value='21'> And the man, wondering at her, 
remained silent so as to know whether Jehovah had prospered his way or not. </p>
<p><LI value='22'> And so it was, when the camels finished drinking, that the man took a gold nose-jewel, half a shekel in weight, and 
two bracelets to go on her hands, ten [shekels] of gold in weight. </p>
<p><LI value='23'> And he said, Whose daughter are you? Tell me now, is there at your father's house a place for us to spend the night? </p>
<p><LI value='24'> And 
she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milkah, whom she bore to Nahor. </p>
<p><LI value='25'> And she said to him, There is both straw and also much fodder with us, and a place to spend the night. </p>
<p><LI value='26'> 
And the man bowed, and bowed down to Jehovah. </p>
<p><LI value='27'> And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned His mercy and His truth towards my master. As for me, being 
on the way, Jehovah has led me to the house of my master's brethren. </p>
<p><LI value='28'> And the girl ran and told [those of] her mother's house all about these things. </p>
<p><LI value='29'> And Rebekah had a brother, and his name 
was Laban; and Laban ran to the man outside, to the spring. </p>
<p><LI value='30'> And so it was - when he saw the nose-jewel and the bracelets on his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, 
who said, Thus the man spoke to me - that he went to the man, and behold, he was standing with the camels at the spring. </p>
<p><LI value='31'> And he said, Come, O blessed of Jehovah; why do you stand outside? And 
I have swept the house, and there is a place for the camels. </p>
<p><LI value='32'> And the man came to the house. And he ungirded the camels, and gave straw and fodder to the camels, and water to wash his feet and 
the feet of the men who were with him. </p>
<p><LI value='33'> And [food] was set before him to eat, and he said, I am not eating until I have spoken my words. And he said, Speak on! </p>
<p><LI value='34'> And he said, I am Abraham's 
servant. </p>
<p><LI value='35'> And Jehovah has blessed my master greatly and has made him great, and has given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and male and female servants, and camels and asses. </p>
<p><LI value='36'> And 
Sarah my master's wife bore a son to my master in her old age; and to him he has given all that he has. </p>
<blockquote>
<LI value='37'> And my master made me swear, saying, You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters 
of the Canaanites, in whose land I am dwelling;
</blockquote>
<p> <LI value='38'> But you shall go to my father's house, and to my family, and you shall take a wife for my son. </p>
<p><LI value='39'> And I said to my master, Perhaps the woman 
is not going to follow me. </p>
<p><LI value='40'> And he said to me, Jehovah, before whom I have walked, will send His angel with you and will prosper your way; and you shall take a wife for my son from my family and 
from my father's house. </p>
<p><LI value='41'> Then you will be clear from my oath, because you have come to my family; and if they will not give her to you, you will be clear from my oath. </p>
<p><LI value='42'> And I came today to 
the spring and said, O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, if You will, prosper now my way which I am walking in. </p>
<p><LI value='43'> Behold, I am standing at a spring of water; and let it be that the young woman 
going out to draw, to whom I say, Give me a drink now of a little water from your pitcher, </p>
<p><LI value='44'> And she says to me, Drink, and I will also draw for your camels - let her be the woman whom Jehovah has 
appointed for my master's son.  </p>
<p><LI value='45'> I had scarcely finished speaking in my heart, and behold, Rebekah came out, with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down to the spring and drew, and I said 
to her, Give me a drink now. </p>
<p><LI value='46'> And she hastened and lowered her pitcher from upon her, and said, Drink, and also I will give your camels a drink; and I drank, and she gave the camels also a drink. </p>
<p><LI value='47'> 
And I asked her and said, Whose daughter are you? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milkah bore to him. And I put a jewel on her nose, and bracelets on her hands. </p>
<p><LI value='48'> 
And I bowed, and bowed down to Jehovah, and blessed Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who led me into the way of truth to take the daughter of my master's brother for his son. </p>
<p><LI value='49'> And now if 
you are going to show mercy and truth to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, and I will look to the right or to the left. </p>
<p><LI value='50'> And Laban answered, then Bethuel, and they said, From Jehovah has 
this thing come; we cannot speak to you bad or good. </p>
<p><LI value='51'> Behold, Rebekah is before you; take her and go, and let her be your master's son's wife, as Jehovah has spoken. </p>
<p><LI value='52'> And so it was, when Abraham's 
servant heard their words, that he bowed down to the earth to Jehovah. </p>
<p><LI value='53'> And the servant brought out vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah; and he gave 
precious things to her brother and to her mother. </p>
<p><LI value='54'> And they ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and stayed the night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me to my master. </p>
<p><LI value='55'> 
And her brother said, and her mother, Let the girl stay with us a week or ten days;<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> after that you will go. </p>
<p><LI value='56'> And he said to them, Do not delay me, since Jehovah has prospered my way. 
Send me away and let me go to my master. </p>
<p><LI value='57'> And they said, Let us call the girl and ask her personally.<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a> </p>
<p><LI value='58'> And they called Rebekah and said to her, Are you going to go with this man? And 
she said, I will go. </p>
<p><LI value='59'> And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant and his men. </p>
<p><LI value='60'> And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, Our sister, may you become thousands 
of myriads, and may your seed inherit the gate of those who hate you. </p>
<p><LI value='61'> And Rebekah rose up, and her maids, and they rode on the camels and went after the man. And the servant took Rebekah and 
went. </p>
<p><LI value='62'> And Isaac had come from<A name="fntext5"></a><A href="#fn5"><sup>e</sup></a> Beer Lahai Roi, and was dwelling in the land of the south. </p>
<p><LI value='63'> And Isaac came out to meditate in the field towards evening, and lifted up his eyes and saw, 
and behold, the camels were coming. </p>
<p><LI value='64'> And Rebekah lifted up her eyes and saw Isaac, and dropped down from upon the camel. </p>
<p>65 And she said to the servant, Who is that man there walking in the field 
to meet us? And the servant said, He is my master. And she took a veil and covered herself. </p>
<p>66 And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done. </p>
<p>67 And Isaac brought her into the tent 
of Sarah his mother; and he took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her. And Isaac was comforted after [the death of] his mother.

Inde videri potest quae recondita Verbum in se habet, quae nusquam in cognitionem alicujus venire possunt nisi ex sensu interno.                        CAPUT XXIV      1.  Et Abraham senex venit in 
dies, et JEHOVAH benedixit Abrahamo in omnibus.      2.  Et dixit Abraham ad servum suum seniorem domus suae, administrantem omnia quae ei, Pone quaeso manum tuam sub femore meo.      3.  Et adjurabo 
te in JEHOVAM DEUM caeli et DEUM terrae, quod non accipias mulierem filio meo e filiabus Canaanitae, cujus ego habito in medio.      4.  Sed ad terram meam, et ad nativitatem meam eas, et accipies 
mulierem filio meo Jishako.      5.  Et dixit ad eum servus, Forte non vult mulier ire post me ad terram hanc.  An reducendo reducam filium tuum ad terram, unde exivisti?      6.  Et dixit ad illum 
Abraham, Cave tibi ne forte reducas filium meum illuc.      7.  JEHOVAH DEUS caeli, Qui accepit me e domo patris mei, et e terra nativitatis meae, et Qui locutus est mihi, et Qui juravit mihi, dicendo, 
Semini tuo dabo terram hanc, Ipse mittet angelum Suum coram te, et accipies mulierem filio meo inde.      8.  Et si non vult mulier ire post te, et immunis es ab adjuratione mea hac, tantum filium 
meum non reducas illuc.      9.  Et posuit servus manum suam sub femore Abrahami domini sui; et adjuravit ei super verbo hoc.      10.  Et sumpsit servus decem camelos e camelis domini sui, et ivit, 
et omne bonum domini sui in manu sua, et surrexit, et ivit ad Aram Naharaim, ad urbem Nahoris.      11.  Et in genua procumbere fecit camelos ab extra urbem, ad puteum aquarum, juxta tempus vesperae, 
juxta tempus exire haustrices.      12.  Et dixit, JEHOVAH DEUS domini mei Abrahami, obvenire fac quaeso coram me hodie, et fac misericordiam cum domino mea Abrahamo.      13.  Ecce ego sto super 
ad fontem aquarum, et filiae virorum urbis exeuntes ad hauriendum aquas.      14.  Et sit, puella, ad quam dico, Declina quaeso cadum tuum, et bibam, et dicat, Bibe, et etiam camelos tuos potabo, 
illam destinasti servo tuo Jishako; et in hoc cognoscam, quod fecisti misericordiam cum domino meo.      15.  Et fuit, ille vix absolvit loqui, e ecce Rebecca exit, quae nata Bethueli filio Milkae uxoris 
Nahoris fratris Abrahami, et cadus ejus super humero ejus.      16.  Et puella bona aspectu valde, virgo, et vir non cognoverat illam et descendit ad fontem, et implevit cadum suum, et ascendit.  
    17.  Et cucurrit servus obviam illi, et dixit, Sorbere fac me quaeso parum aquae e cado tuo.      18.  Et dixit, Bibe domine mi, et festinavit et demisit cadum suum super manum suam, et potare 
fecit illum.      19.  Et absolvit potare facere illum, et dixit, Etiam camelis tuis hauriam, usque dum absolverint bibere.      20.  Et festinabat et evacuabat cadum suum ad canalem, et currebat adhuc 
ad puteum ad hauriendum, et hauriebat omnibus camelis illius.      21.  Et vir obstupescens illi continens se, ad sciendum an prosperavisset JEHOVAH viam suam, vel non.      22.  Et fuit, quando 
absolverunt cameli bibere, et accepit vir monile auri, dimidium sicli pondus ejus, et duas armillas super manus ejus, decem auri pondus earum.      23.  Et dixit, Filia cujus tu? indica quaeso mihi, 
an est domo patris tui locus nobis ad pernoctandum?      24.  Et dixit ad illum, Filia Bethuelis ego, filii Milkae, quem genuit Nahori.      25.  Et dixit ad illam, Etiam stramen, etiam pabulum multum 
nobiscum, etiam locus ad pernoctandum.      26.  Et inflexit se vir, et incurvavit se JEHOVAE.      27.  Et dixit, Benedictus JEHOVAH DEUS domini mei Abrahami, Qui non dereliquit misericordiam 
Suam, et veritatem Suam a eum domino meo; ego in via, duxit me JEHOVAH domum fratrum domini mei.      28.  Et cucurrit puella, et indicabat domui matris suae juxta verba illa.      29.  Et Rebeccae 
frater, et nomen ejus Laban, et currebat Laban ad virum foras ad fontem.      30.  Et fat, ut videre monile et armillas super manibus sororis suae, et ut audire eum verba Rebeccae sororis suae, dicendo, 
Ita locutus ad me vir; et venit ad virum, et ecce stans apud camelos apud fontem.      31.  Et dixit, Veni benedicte JEHOVAE, quare stas foris? Et ego verri domum, et locus camelis.      32.  Et 
venit vir domum, et solvit camelos, et dedit stramen et pabulum camelis, et aquam ad lavandum pedes ejus, et pedes virorum qui cum illo.      33.  Et ponebatur coram illo ad edendum, et dixit, Non edo, 
usque dum locutus sum verba mea, et dixit, Loquere.      34.  Et dixit, Servus Abrahami ego.      35.  Et JEHOVAH benedixit domino meo valde, et magnificavit et dedit ei gregem et armentum, et argentum 
et aurum, et servos et ancillas, et camelos et asinos.      36.  Et peperit Sarah uxor domini mei filium domino meo post senectutem suam, et dedit illi omnia quae ei.      37.  Et adjuravit 
me dominus meus, dicendo, Non accipies mulierem filio meo e filiabus Canaanitae, cujus ego habito in terra.      38.  Non nisi ad domum patris mei ibis, et ad familiam meam et accipies mulierem filio 
meo.      39.  Et dixi ad dominum meum, Forte non eat mulier post me.      40.  Et dixit ad me, JEHOVAH, Quo ambulavi coram, mittet angelum Suum cum te, et prosperabit viam tuam, et accipias mulierem 
filio meo, e familia mea, et e domo patris mei; </p>
<p>     41.  Tunc immunis eris ab obsecratione mea, quod veneris ad familiam meam; et si non dederint tibi, et eris immunis ab obsecratione mea.      
42.  Et veni hodie ad fontem, et dixi, JEHOVAH DEUS domini mei Abrahami, si sit Tibi quaeso prosperans viam meam, qua ego ambulans super.      43.  Ecce ego sto apud fontem aquarum, et sit adolescentula 
exiens ad hauriendum, et dico ad illam, Fac potare me quaeso parum aquae e cado tuo.      44.  Et dicat ad me, Etiam tu bibe, et etiam camelis tuis hauriam, illa mulier quam destinavit JEHOVAH filio 
domini mei.      45.  Ego vix absolvi loqui ad cor meum, et ecce Rebecca exit, et cadus ejus super humero ejus, et descendit ad fontem, et haurit, et dixi ad illam, Fac potare me quaeso.      46. 
 Et festinabat et demittebat cadum suum desuper se, et dicebat, Bibe, et etiam camelos tuos potabo; et bibi, et etiam camelos potavit.      47.  Et interrogabam illam, et dicebam, Filia cujus tu? Et 
dixit, Filia Bethuelis filii Nahoris, quem peperit illi Milkah: et posui monile super nasum illius, et armillas super manus illius.      48.  Et inflexi et incurvavi me JEHOVAH, et benedixi JEHOVAE 
DEO domini mei Abrahami, Qui duxit me in viam veritatis ad accipiendum filiam fratris domini mei filio suo.      49.  Et nunc si sitis vos facientes misericordiam et veritatem cum domino meo, indicate 
mihi, et si non, indicate mihi, et spectabo ad dextram vel ad sinistram.      50.  Et respondit Laban et Bethuel, et dixerunt, A JEHOVAH exivit verbum, non possumus loqui ad te malum vel bonum.  
    51.  Ecce Rebecca coram te, accipe et vade, et sit mulier  filio domini tui, quemadmodum locutus JEHOVAH.      52.  Et fuit, ut audivit servus Abrahami verba illorum, et incurvavit se ad terram JEHOVAE.  
    53.  Et eduxit servus vasa argenti et vasa auri, et vestes, et dedit Rebeccae; et pretiosa dedit fratri ejus, et matri ejus.      54.  Et ederunt et biberunt ille et viri qui cum illo, 
et pernoctarunt, et surrexerunt in mane, et dixit, Mittite me domino meo.      55.  Et dixit frater ejus, et mater ejus, Maneat puella cum nobis dies aut decem, post ibis.      56.  Et dixit ad illos, 
Ne moremini me, et JEHOVAH prosperavit viam meam, mittite me, et vadam domino meo.      57.  Et dixerunt, Vocemus puellam, et interrogemus os illius.      58.  Et vocarunt Rebeccam, et dixerunt ad 
illam, An eas cum viro hoc? et dixit, Ibo.      59.  Et miserunt Rebeccam sororem suam, et nutricem ejus, et servum Abrahami, et viros ejus.      60.  Et benedixerunt Rebeccae, et dixerunt illi, Soror 
nostra tu sis in millia myriadis, et hereditet semen tuum portam osorum {1}tuorum. @1 Heb.=suorum$       61.  Et surrexit Rebecca, et puellae ejus, et equitabant super camelis, et ibant post virum; 
et accepit servus Rebeccam, et ivit.      62.  Et Jishak venit a veniendo Beer-lahai-roi, et ille habitans in terra meridiei.      63.  Et exivit Jishak ad meditandum in agro, versus vesperam, 
et sustulit oculos suos, et vidit, et ecce cameli venientes.      64.  Et sustulit Rebecca oculos suos, et vidit Jishakum, et cecidit desuper camelo.      65.  Et dixit ad servum, Quis vir ille ibi 
ambulans in agro obviam nobis? et dixit servus, Ille dominus meus; et accepit peplum et obtexit se.      66.  Et narrabat servus Jishako omnia verba quae fecit.      67.  Et introduxit illam Jishak 
in tentorium Sarae matris suae; et accepit Rebeccam, et erat ei in mulierem, et amavit illam; et consolatus est Jishakus post matrem suam. </p>
