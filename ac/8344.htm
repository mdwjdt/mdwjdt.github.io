<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8344.</strong>出埃及记15:22-26.摩西叫以色列人从红海往前行，他们出去到书珥的旷野，在旷野走了三天，找不着水。到了玛拉，因苦不能喝水，因为它们是苦的，所以他给它起名叫玛拉。百姓就向摩西发怨言说，我们喝什么呢？摩西呼求耶和华，耶和华指示他一块木头，他把木头丢在水里，水就变甜了。耶和华为他定了律例、典章，在那里试验他。又说，你若顺服听从耶和华你神的声音，又行祂眼中看为正的事，听从祂的诫命，守祂一切的律例，我就不将所加与埃及人的一切疾病加在你们身上，因为我是耶和华，你的医治者。<br />“摩西叫以色列人从红海往前行”表他们经过一片地狱区域之后，符合神之真理秩序的下一个阶段。“他们出去到书珥的旷野”表他们接下来被引入的试探状态。“在旷野走了三天，找不着水”表真理是缺乏的，最后完全缺乏。“到了玛拉”表一个试探的状态。“因苦不能喝水，因为它们是苦的”表在他们看来，真理是令人不快的，因为缺乏对良善的情感。“所以他给它起名叫玛拉”表这个试探的状态和本质。“百姓就向摩西发怨言”表试探的苦楚所造成的悲伤。“说，我们喝什么呢”表他们无法忍受真理，因为这些真理由于缺乏对良善的情感而令他们不快。“摩西呼求耶和华”表由于悲伤而向主祈求。“耶和华指示他一块木头”表主安置良善。“他把木头丢在水里”表他用良善充满真理。“水就变甜了”表这些真理由此变得令人愉快。“耶和华为他定了律例、典章”表那时秩序的真理被揭示出来。“在那里试验他”表在总体上的试探方面。“又说”表指示。“你若顺服听从耶和华你神的声音”表信主的诫命。“又行祂眼中看为正的事”表照诫命生活。“听从祂的诫命”表顺服并照信之良善，也就是教会的内在事物生活。“守祂一切的律例”表照信之真理，也就是教会的外在事物生活。“我就不将所加与埃及人的一切疾病加在你们身上”表他们要被阻离存在于那些陷入分离之信并过着邪恶生活之人中间的邪恶。“因为我是耶和华，你的医治者”表唯独主保护他们免受邪恶伤害。</p>

Verses 22-26. And Moses made Israel set out from the sea Suph, and they went out to the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no waters. And they came to Marah, and 
they could not drink the waters for bitterness, because they were bitter; therefore he called the name thereof Marah. And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? And he cried 
unto Jehovah, and Jehovah showed him a piece of wood, and he cast it to the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There He set for him a statute and a judgment, and there He tempted him. And He said, 
If hearing thou wilt hear the voice of Jehovah thy God, and wilt do what is right in His eyes, and wilt hearken to His commandments, and wilt keep all His statutes, all the disease that I have put 
on the Egyptians, I will not put upon thee, because I am Jehovah thy healer. "And Moses made Israel set out from the sea Suph," signifies what is successive according to the order of truth Divine after 
they had passed through a region of hell; "and they went out to the wilderness of Shur," signifies the state of temptation into which they were next brought; "and they went three days in the wilderness, 
and found no waters," signifies that truths failed, and at last wholly; "and they came to Marah," signifies a state of temptation; "and they could not drink the waters for bitterness, because they 
were bitter," signifies that truths appeared to them undelightful, because devoid of the affection of good; "therefore he called the name thereof Marah," signifies the state and quality of this temptation; 
"and the people murmured against Moses," signifies grief from the bitterness of the temptation; "saying, What shall we drink?" signifies that they could not endure truths, because they were undelightful 
by reason of no affection of them; "and he cried unto Jehovah," signifies supplication to the Lord from grief; "and Jehovah showed him a piece of wood," signifies that the Lord inspired good; 
"and he cast it into the waters," signifies with which He affected the truths; "and the waters were made sweet," signifies that from this truths were made delightful; "there He set for him a statute 
and a judgment," signifies the truth of order then revealed; "and there He tempted him," signifies in respect to temptations in general; "and He said," signifies instruction; "If hearing thou wilt hear 
the voice of Jehovah thy God," signifies faith in the Lord's commandments; "and wilt do what is right in His eyes," signifies a life according to them; "and wilt hearken to His commandments," signifies 
obedience, and a life according to the goods of faith, which are the interior things of the church; "and wilt keep all His statutes," signifies a life according to the truths of faith, which are 
the exterior things of the church; "all the disease that I have put on the Egyptians, I will not put upon thee," signifies that they are to be withheld from the evils that pertain to those who are in 
faith separate and in a life of evil; "because I am Jehovah thy healer," signifies that the Lord alone preserves from evils. </p>

Verses 22-26 And Moses caused Israel to travel on from the Sea Suph, and they went out to the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness and did not find water. And they came to Marah, 
and they could not drink the waters for bitterness; for they were bitter. Therefore he called the name of it Marah. And the people grumbled against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? And he cried 
to Jehovah; and Jehovah showed him [some] wood, and he threw it into the waters, and the waters became sweet. There He established for him a statute and a judgement, and there He tempted him. And He 
said, If you obediently hear the voice of Jehovah your God, and do what is right in His eyes, and hearken to His commandments, and keep all His statutes, I will not put on you any sickness that I put 
on the Egyptians; for I, Jehovah am your Healer. </p>
<p>'And Moses caused Israel to travel on from the Sea Suph' means a further stage in accordance with the order made known by God's truth, after they 
had passed through a region of hell. 'And they went out to the wilderness of Shur' means a state of temptation into which they were led after that. 'And they went three days in the wilderness and did 
not find water' means that truths were lacking, and at length were plainly so. 'And they came to Marah' means a state of temptation. 'And they could not drink the waters for bitterness; for they were 
bitter' means that truths seemed to them to be unpleasant, as being devoid of an affection for good. 'Therefore he called the name of it Marah' means the state and essential nature of that temptation. 
'And the people grumbled against Moses' means grief caused by the bitterness of the temptation. 'Saying, What shall we drink?' means that they cannot tolerate truths because, as a result of their lack 
of affection [for good], they find them unpleasant. 'And he cried to Jehovah' means pleas made to the Lord as a result of the grief. 'And Jehovah showed him [some] wood' means that the Lord instilled 
good. 'And he threw it into the waters' means with which he suffused the truths. 'And the waters became sweet' means that as a result the truths were made pleasant. 'There He established for him a statute 
and a judgement' means the truth of order, such as was revealed at that time. 'And there he tempted him' means in respect of temptations in general. 'And He said' means instruction. 'If you obediently 
hear the voice of Jehovah your God' means faith in the Lord's commandments. 'And do what is right in His eyes' means a life in keeping with them. 'And hearken to His commandments' means obedience 
and a life in keeping with forms of the good of faith, which are interior aspects of the Church. 'And keep all His statutes' means a life in keeping with the truths of faith, which are exterior aspects 
of the Church. 'I will not put on you any sickness that I put on the Egyptians' means that they are to be withheld from the evils present among those who uphold separated faith and lead a life of 
evil. 'For I, Jehovah, am your Healer' means that the Lord alone preserves them from evils. </p>

Vers. 22-26.  Et proficisci fecit Moscheh Israelem a mari Suph, et exiverunt ad desertum Schur, et iverunt tres dies in deserto, et non invenerunt aquas.  Et venerunt ad Marah, et non potuerunt bibere 
aquas prae amaritudine, quia amarae illae; propterea vocavit nomen ejus Marah.  Et murmuraverunt populus contra Moschen, dicendo, Quid bibemus?  Et clamavit ad Jehovam, et monstravit illi Jehovah lignum, 
et projecit ad aquas, et dulces factae aquae; ibi posuit (x)illi statutum et judicium, et ibi tentavit illum.  Et dixit, Si audiendo audiveris vocem Jehovae Dei tui, et rectum in oculis Ipsius 
feceris, et auscultaveris praeceptis Ipsius, et custodiveris omnia statuta Ipsius, omnem morbum quem posui in Aegyptios, non ponam super te, quia Ego Jehovah sanator tuus.  `Et proficisci fecit Moscheh 
Israelem a mari Suph' significat successivum secundum ordinem veri Divini, postquam transiverunt regionem inferni: `et exiverunt ad desertum Schur' significat statum tentationis in quem dein perducti: 
`et iverunt tres dies in deserto, et non invenerunt aquas' significat quod vera deficerent, et tandem plane: `et venerunt ad Marah' significat statum tentationis: `et non potuerunt bibere aquas prae 
amaritudine, quia amarae illae' significat quod vera illis apparerent injucunda, quia absque affectione boni: `propterea vocavit nomen Marah' significat statum et quale illius tentationis: `et murmuraverunt 
populus contra Moschen' significat indolentiam ex tentationis acerbitate: `dicendo, Quid bibemus?' significat quod non sustineant vera, quia injucunda ex nulla illorum (x)affectione: `et clamavit 
ad Jehovam' significat supplicationem ad (x)Dominum ex indolentia: `et monstravit illi Jehovah lignum' significat quod Dominus bonum inspiraverit: `et projecit in aquas' significat quo affecit vera: 
`et dulces factae aquae' significat quod inde vera jucunda facta: `ibi posuit illi statutum et judicium' significat verum ordinis tunc revelatum: `et ibi tentavit illum' significat quoad tentationes 
in genere: `et dixit' significat instructionem: `Si audiendo audiveris vocem Jehovae Dei tui' significat fidem praeceptorum Domini: `et rectum in oculis Ipsius feceris' significat vitam secundum illa: 
`et auscultaveris praeceptis Ipsius' significat oboedientiam et vitam secundum bona fidei quae sunt interiora Ecclesiae: `et custodiveris omnia statuta Ipsius' significat vitam secundum vera fidei 
quae sunt exteriora Ecclesiae: `omnem morbum quem posui in Aegyptios non ponam super te' significat quod detinendi a malis quae illis qui in fide separata et in vita mali: `quia Ego Jehovah sanator tuus' 
significat quod Dominus solus praeservet a malis. </p>
