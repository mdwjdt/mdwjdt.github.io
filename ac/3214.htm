<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3214节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3214.</strong>属灵和属天之物有时以长长的序列显现，持续一两小时，并且它们以奇迹般的秩序不断接踵而至。有些社群会出现这些代表物，我曾被允许与它们在一起好几个月。但这些代表具有这样的性质，即照其顺序单单讲述并描述其中一个，就得占用大量篇幅。它们非常令人愉悦，因为意想不到的新事物不断接连到来，并且代表的这种序列会持续到正在呈现的事物完全并完美地被展示出来为止。然后，一旦所有事物都被完美展示出来，人就可以将它们作为一个整体来审视，同时注意到每个细节表示什么。善灵还以此方式被引入属灵和属天的概念中。</p>

Representatives of things spiritual and celestial sometimes come forth in a long series, continued for an hour or two, in such an order successively as is marvelous. There are societies in which these 
representatives take place; and it has been given me to be with them for many months. But these representations are of such a nature that it would take many pages to relate and describe a single one 
of them in its order. They are very delightful, for something new and unexpected continually follows in succession, and this until what is represented is being fully perfected; and when all things have 
been perfectly represented, it is possible to contemplate everything in one view; and then it is at the same time given to take note of what is signified by each detail. Moreover good spirits are in 
this way initiated into spiritual and celestial ideas. </p>

Representatives of spiritual and celestial things sometimes manifest themselves in a lengthy sequence lasting one or two hours, and they follow consecutively in an order that is a marvel. There are communities 
among which those representatives are produced, and where I have been allowed to go for many months. But those representations are such that if I were to mention and describe just one of them 
in its sequence it would fill many pages. They are utterly delightful, for something new and unexpected is constantly occurring. And the sequence of representations continues until that which is being 
represented is displayed completely and perfectly. Then once all things have been displayed perfectly, one is allowed to look at them as a single whole, and at the same time to discern what each individual 
thing means by itself. Good spirits are also introduced to spiritual and celestial ideas in this fashion. </p>

Repraesentativa spiritualium et caelestium existunt quandoque longa serie, per tempus horarium aut bihorium continuata, ordine tali successive ut mirabile; sunt societates apud quas {1}illa fiunt; ac 
datum est mihi per plures menses cum illis esse; sed illae repraesentationes tales sunt ut si modo unam suo ordine memorarem et describerem, plures paginae implerentur; sunt perquam jucundae, nam continue 
aliquid novum inexspectatum succedit; et hoc usque dum illud quod repraesentatur, plene perficitur; {2}cumque omnia perfecta sunt, contemplari illa licet uno intuitu, et tunc simul datur appercipere 
quid singula {3}significant. Spiritus boni in ideas spirituales et caelestes ita quoque initiantur. @1 illae$  @2 et cum$  @3 significabant$  </p>
