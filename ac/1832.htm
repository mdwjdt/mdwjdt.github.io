<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1832节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1832.</strong>“只有鸟没有劈开”表属灵事物没有这种平行和对应。这从“鸟”的含义和他没有从中间将鸟劈开的事实清楚可知。如刚才说的（9节），“鸟”是指（有别于属天之物的）属灵之物。因此，属灵之物没有这种平行和对应。如所常说的，属灵之物是指构成信的一切事物，因而是指一切教义。因为这些被称为信的事物，尽管在与仁爱结合之前它们并不属于信。这些事物与主之间不存在任何平行和对应，因为它们不是如爱与仁之物那样经由内在指示和良知流入的那类事物。它们通过教导、因而通过聆听流入，因此并非通过相对内在之物，而是通过相对外在之物流入，并以这种方式在人里面形成它们的容器或接受器。<br />它们多半看似真理，但并非真理。如那些属于圣言字义的事物，它们是真理的代表物和有意义的符号，因而本身并非真理。其中一些甚至是虚假，不过，这些虚假可充当容器和接受器。但主里面只有纯全和本质上的真理，因此，对这些表面真理而言，平行和对应并不存在。然而，它们仍适合充当属爱与仁的属天之物的容器。这些表面真理就是构成前面所说的理解力部分的云层之物，主将仁爱注入到这理解力部分，从而形成良知。<br />例如，那些持守圣言字义之人以为是主引入试探，然后折磨人的良心，还以为由于主容许邪恶，故祂是邪恶的起因，并且祂将恶人扔进地狱等等。这些都是表面真理，故平行和对应并不存在。然而，主使它们在人里面原封不动，并凭借仁爱奇迹般地调适它们，以使其能充当属天之物的容器。这同样适用于敬拜、教导、宗教活动，甚至诚实的外邦人的偶像。主同样使这些事物保持原样，然而却凭借仁爱调适它们，以使其能充当容器。在古教会和后来的犹太教会，很多仪式就是这种情形。它们本身无非是没有真理的仪式，但却被容忍和允许，甚至是所规定的。因为这些仪式被父母遵为神圣，而且自他们孩提时起，就被如此植入并作为真理被铭刻在他们心上。<br />鸟没有劈开这句话所表示的，就是这些及其它类似事物。因为事物一旦被植入在人的信念中，并被尊为神圣，只要不违背神序，主就会使它们保持原样。尽管平行和对应并不存在，但主仍会调适它们。犹太教会献祭时所用的没有劈开的鸟所表示的，就是这些事物。因为劈开就是使两个部分以完全对应的方式彼此对应。但由于所论及的这些事物没有完全对应，故在来世，对那些允许自己接受教导之人而言，它们会被抹去，然后真理本身被植入在他们对良善的情感中。在犹太教会，由于这种代表和含义的缘故，鸟没有劈开。这一点从摩西书明显看出来：<br />人奉给耶和华的供物，若以鸟为燔祭，就要献斑鸠或是雏鸽为供物。要拿着鸟的两个翅膀，把鸟撕开，只是不可撕断。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利1.14.htm">1:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利1.17.htm">17</a>）<br />赎罪祭也是如此（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利5.7.htm">5:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利5.8.htm">8</a>）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1832.</strong> But the fowl he did not split means that spiritual things lack this symmetry and correspondence. This can be seen from the symbolism of fowl as something spiritual, as dealt with at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1832/bible_king-james-version_genesis_15_9" target=_top>9</a> just above [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1832/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1826" target=_top>1826-1827</a>]. It can also be seen from the fact that Abram did not divide the fowl in half, so that there is no symmetry or correspondence of this kind.<br />As noted many times before,{*1} "spiritual" means everything that has to do with faith. Consequently it means all doctrine, since doctrine is called the teachings of faith, even though these teachings are not a part of faith until they are united with charity, or love for others. There is no parallelism or correspondence between these spiritual entities and the Lord, because they are not the kinds of things that enter us by way of an inner voice or conscience, as attributes of love and charity do. Instead they enter us by way of instruction, and so by hearing.{*2} In other words, they enter not from inside but from outside and therefore create their own vessels or containers in us.<br />[2] For the most part they seem to be true and yet are not, such as literal statements in the Word that either represent true ideas or symbolize true ideas and therefore are not true in themselves. Some are even false and yet are capable of serving as vessels and containers. In the Lord, though, they are pure truth, truth in its essence. So there is no parallelism or correspondence between the two. However, spiritual elements can still be molded to serve as vessels for heavenly contents, which are matters of love and charity. Spiritual things make up the cloud in our intellectual half that the Lord injects with charity in order to create conscience, as discussed earlier [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1832/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1043" target=_top>1043</a>].<br />[3] Some people, for instance, restrict themselves to the literal level of the Word and believe that the Lord is the one who leads us into crisis and at the same time tortures our conscience. Because he permits evil, they consider him the cause of evil. They think he sends sinners to hell, and so on. To them these ideas seem true, but they are not, and because they are not strictly true, there is no symmetry or correspondence. Yet the Lord leaves them intact in such a person and adapts them in a miraculous way, by means of charity, to serve as vessels for heavenly impulses.<br />It is the same with the worship, doctrines, and moral code — even the idols — of honest non-Christians. These the Lord leaves equally intact, at the same time adapting them too, by means of charity, to serve as vessels.<br />It was the same with very many rituals in the ancient church and later in the Jewish religion. Of themselves these rituals were completely devoid of truth, but they were tolerated and allowed, and even ordered, because ancestors of the people in these religions had held them sacred. As a result, they had been grafted and etched onto these people's minds from infancy as being full of truth.<br />[4] These and other things like them are what are symbolized by the fact that the fowl were not split. Once an idea has been planted in our mind and we come to view it as holy, the Lord leaves it intact, as long as it does not violate divine order. Although it may not be parallel or correspond, he still adapts it.<br />These things are also what were symbolized in the Jewish religion by the practice of not splitting birds in sacrifice. Dividing something is putting the parts opposite each other so that like corresponds to like. Because the kinds of things being discussed here have no like to correspond to, in the other world they are erased from consciousness in people who allow themselves to be taught, and genuine truth is transplanted into their positive emotions.<br />It can be seen in Moses that birds were not divided in the Jewish religion, because of this representation and symbolism:<br />If their offering to Jehovah is the burnt offering of a bird, they shall bring some turtledoves or some offspring of a pigeon and shall cleave it with its wings, not divide it.{*3} (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1832/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_1_14" target=_top>Leviticus 1:14</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1832/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_1_17" target=_top>17</a>)<br />Likewise in sacrifices for a sin offering{*4} (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1832/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_5_7-8" target=_top>Leviticus 5:7-8</a>).<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For passages identifying spirituality with faith, see, for instance, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1832/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_52" target=_top>52</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1832/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_418" target=_top>418-419</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1832/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_790" target=_top>790</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1832/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1096#subsection-2-3" target=_top>1096:3</a>. [LHC]<br />{*2} This is likely an allusion to <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1832/bible_king-james-version_romans_10_17" target=_top>Romans 10:17</a>.

[LHC]<br />{*3} The instruction to cleave the bird but not divide it seems contradictory, but the idea may be that the priest was to cut the bird open without splitting it completely in two. See the rendering of the New Revised Standard Version, for instance: "He shall tear it open by its wings without severing it." [LHC]<br />{*4} Jewish Law distinguishes between a burnt offering and a sin offering. The burnt offering was a sacrifice of worship proper: the entire animal was consumed by the fire and went up "in the flame of the altar to God expressing the ascent of the soul in worship" (Brown, Driver, and Briggs 1996, page 750 left column, under עֹלָה [‘ōlā], Strong's 5930). The sin offering, by contrast, was offered specifically to atone for sin (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1832/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_4_2" target=_top>Leviticus 4:2</a> and following). The entire animal was not burnt at once; it was partly burnt on the altar, and then either was carried outside the sanctuary and burnt there or was eaten by the priests (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1832/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_4_12" target=_top>Leviticus 4:12</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1832/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_5_13" target=_top>5:13</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1832/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_16_27" target=_top>16:27</a>; Brown, Driver, and Briggs 1996, pages 309 left column to 310 left column, under חַטָּאת [ḥaṭṭāṯ], Strong's 2403, definition 4).

And the birds he did not divide. That this signifies spiritual things, and that in them there is not such a parallelism and correspondence, is evident from the signification of "birds," as being what 
is spiritual [as distinguished from what is celestial], and as treated of in verse 9, just above; and from the statement that he did not divide the birds in the midst; consequently that there is not 
such a parallelism and correspondence. By spiritual things are signified, as often said before, all the things of faith, consequently all doctrinal things, for these are called things of faith, although 
they are not of faith until they have been conjoined with charity. Between these and the Lord there is not a parallelism and correspondence, for they are such things as do not flow in by internal dictate 
and conscience, as do those which are of love and charity, but they flow in by instruction, and so by hearing, thus not from the interior, but from the exterior, and in this way they form their 
vessels or recipients in man.  [2] The greater part of them appear as if they were truths, but are not truths, such as those things which are of the literal sense of the Word, and are representatives 
of truth and significatives of truth, and thus are not in themselves truths; some of them even being falsities, which however can serve as vessels and recipients. But in the Lord there are none but 
truths that are essentially such; and therefore with these there is no parallelism and correspondence on the part of those apparent truths, but still they may be so adapted as to serve as vessels for 
the celestial things which are of love and charity. These apparent truths are what constitute the cloud of the intellectual part, before spoken of, into which the Lord insinuates charity, and so makes 
conscience.  [3] For example: with those who remain in the sense of the letter of the Word, and suppose that it is the Lord who leads into temptation and who then torments man's conscience, and who 
suppose that because He permits evil He is the cause of evil, and that He thrusts the evil down into hell, with other similar things: these are apparent truths, but are not truths; and because they are 
not truths that are such in themselves, there is no parallelism and correspondence. Still the Lord leaves them intact in man, and miraculously adapts them by means of charity so that they can serve 
celestial things as vessels. So also with the worship, the religious teachings and morals, and even with the idols, of the well-disposed Gentiles; these likewise the Lord leaves intact, and yet adapts 
them by means of charity so that they also serve as vessels. The case was the same in regard to the very numerous rites in the Ancient Church, and afterwards in the Jewish Church; which in themselves 
were nothing but rituals in which there was not truth, but which were tolerated and permitted, and indeed commanded, because they were held as sacred by parents, and so were implanted in the minds of 
children and impressed upon them from infancy as truths.  [4] These and other such things are what are signified by the statement that the birds were not divided. For the things that are once implanted 
in a man's opinion, and are accounted as holy, the Lord leaves intact, provided they are not contrary to Divine order; and although there is no parallelism and correspondence, still He adapts them. 
These same things are what was signified in the Jewish Church by the birds not being divided in the sacrifices; for to divide is to place the parts opposite to each other in such a manner that they 
may adequately correspond; and because the things which have been spoken of are not adequately in correspondence, they are obliterated in the other life with those who suffer themselves to be instructed, 
and truths themselves are implanted in their affections of good. That in the Jewish Church for the sake of this representation and signification the birds were not divided, is evident in Moses: </p>
<p> 
    If his offering to Jehovah be a burnt-offering of birds, then he shall bring his offering of turtle-doves or of the sons of the pigeon. And he shall cleave it with its wings, he shall not divide it 
(Lev. 1:14, 17). And the same in the case of the sacrifices for sin (Lev. 5:7-8). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1832</b></p><p><b>1832.</b>
'But the birds he did not cut apart' means that no such parallelism and correspondence existed in the case of spiritual things. This is clear from the meaning of 'birds' as that which is spiritual, dealt 
with just above in verse 9, and from the fact that he did not part the birds down the middle, which consequently means that no such parallelism and correspondence existed in their case. By spiritual 
things, as has often been stated already, are meant all those things that constitute faith, consequently all those things which are matters of doctrine, as these are called matters of faith even though 
in fact they are not so until they have been joined to charity. Between these and the Lord no parallelism and correspondence exists, for they are not such as flow in through an internal dictate 
and through conscience - as matters of love and charity do - but such as flow in through the reception of teaching and so through hearing, thus not from what is more internal, but from that which is more 
external; and in this way they form in man their vessels or recipients. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The majority of these have the appearance of being truths but in fact they are not so - like those things which belong 
to the literal sense of the Word, being also representatives of truth, and meaningful signs of truth, and so not in themselves truths. Some are even falsities, which nevertheless are able to serve as 
vessels and recipients. With the Lord however only those exist which are wholly and essentially truths, and therefore no parallelism or correspondence exists involving those apparent truths. Yet they 
may be rendered suitable to serve celestial things - which are matters of love and charity - as vessels. These apparent truths are what constitute the cloud in the understanding part of the mind, dealt 
with already, into which the Lord infuses charity and so forms conscience. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Take, for example, people who keep to the sense of the letter of the Word and imagine that it is the Lord who brings 
on temptation, that it is He who at such times tortures a person's conscience, and who imagine that because He permits evil He is the author of evil, that He thrusts the wicked down into hell, and 
similar ideas. These are not truths, but apparent truths. And because they are not in themselves truths there is no parallelism and correspondence. Nevertheless the Lord leaves these things in man as 
they are and in a remarkable fashion adapts them by means of charity so that they may serve as vessels for celestial things. The same applies as well to the worship, the teachings, the practices, even 
the idols, of honest gentiles. In the same way the Lord leaves these things as they are, yet adapts them by means of charity so that they too may serve as vessels. The same was true of so many of the 
forms of ritual in the Ancient Church, and subsequently in the Jewish Church. In themselves they were nothing more than religious observances that contained no truth in them and which were tolerated 
and permitted, even prescribed, because they had been held sacred by parents, and so had been implanted in and impressed upon their minds as truths since they were children. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 These and other such 
things are what are meant by the statement that the birds were not divided. For the things that are once implanted in a person's beliefs and are held sacred, provided they are not contrary to Divine 
order, are left by the Lord as they are; and although no parallelism or correspondence exists He nevertheless adapts them. The same things were also meant in the sacrifices of the Jewish Church by the 
birds not being divided, for to divide is to set one part opposite the other so that they exactly correspond. But because those things to which reference has been made are not exactly correspondent, 
they are in the next life blotted out in the case of those who allow themselves to be taught, and truths themselves are implanted in their affections for good. For the sake of this representation and 
meaning, birds in the Jewish Church were not divided, as is clear in Moses, </p>
