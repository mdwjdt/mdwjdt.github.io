<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1047.</strong>“我使云彩遮盖地的时候”表当由于人的自我中心的意愿部分，仁之信没有出现的时候。这一点从刚才有关“地”，即人的自我中心的意愿部分的论述清楚可知。这意愿部分具有这种性质，它不断将昏暗或虚假倾注到觉知部分，这就是“云彩遮盖”，也是一切虚假的源头。这从以下事实很明显地看出来，即属于人之意愿的我欲和物欲无非是仇恨。人有多爱自己，就有多恨邻人。由于这些爱与天堂之爱背道而驰，故诸如违反相爱之类的事物必然不断从他们那里流入。觉知部分中的所有这些事物都是虚假，那里的一切昏暗和黑暗皆由它们产生。虚假遮蔽真理，犹如乌云遮蔽阳光。由于虚假与真理无法共存，就象黑暗与光明无法共存一样，故明显可知一个会随着另一个的到来而离开。这种情形会交替发生，所以此处经上说“我使云彩遮盖地的时候”，即仁之信，或真理及其衍生的良善不再出现的时候，尤其良善及其衍生的真理不再出现的时候。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1047.</strong> The fact that and it will happen in my clouding the earth over with cloud means when our self-will blocks any view of a loving faith can be seen from statements directly above concerning the earth, or human self-will. Human self-will, it was noted, is such that it pours a continuous stream of darkness (falsity) into our intellectual side, which is the clouding over. That is where all falsity comes from.<br />The fact of the matter is fairly evident from this: All selfishness and materialism — which are matters of human will — are simply forms of hatred, because the more we love ourselves the more we hate our neighbor. Since love for ourselves and love of worldly gain are therefore opposed to heavenly love, they necessarily pour out a constant stream of impulses that go against mutual love. These impulses, as they exist on the intellectual side, are all falsities. From them comes all our darkness and shadow. Falsity clouds truth, exactly as a dark cloud obscures sunlight. And since falsity and truth cannot coexist — just as darkness and light cannot — obviously the one recedes as the other approaches. This happens in cycles, and that is why it says here, "in clouding the earth with cloud," which speaks of times when self-will blocks any view of a loving faith, or of truth and the good it leads to, let alone of goodness and the truth it leads to. </p>

And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth. That this signifies when on account of the Own of man's will part the faith of charity does not appear, is evident from what has been said 
just above about the earth-or the Own of man's will part-namely, that it is of such a nature that it continually pours into the intellectual part of man what is obscure, or false, which is a "clouding 
over" and is the source of all falsity. This is sufficiently evident from the fact that the loves of self and of the world-which are of man's will-are nothing but hatred. For insofar as anyone loves 
himself, so far he hates the neighbor. And because these loves are so contrary to heavenly love, such things must needs continually flow in from them as are contrary to mutual love, and in the intellectual 
part all these are falsities. Thence comes all its darkness and obscurity. Falsity beclouds truth, just as a dark cloud does the light of the sun. And because falsity and truth cannot be together, 
just as darkness and light cannot, it plainly follows that the one departs as the other comes. And since this happens with alternation, it is therefore said here, "When I bring a cloud over the 
earth" that is, when through the Own of the will part, the faith of charity, or truth with its derivative good, does not appear, and still less good with its derivative truth. </p>

That 'and when I cloud over the earth with cloud' means a time when, the will part of man's proprium being what it is, faith that flows from charity does not appear, is clear from what has been stated 
just above regarding 'the earth', that is, about the will part of man's proprium being such that it is constantly introducing obscurity, or falsity, into the understanding part. This is 'a clouding 
over'. All falsity originates in this way, as becomes quite clear from the fact that self-love and love of the world which belong to man's will are nothing else than hatred. For insofar as anyone loves 
himself he hates the neighbour. Because these loves are so contrary to heavenly love, it is inevitable that such things as are contrary to mutual love should be constantly flowing in from them. All 
of those things in the understanding part are falsities, and from them arises all the obscurity and darkness that is there. Falsity 'clouds over truth just as a dark cloud does to the light of the sun. 
And because falsity and truth cannot be present simultaneously any more than darkness and light, it follows plainly that one goes out as the other comes in. And this being an alternating occurrence 
reference is therefore made here to 'clouding over the earth with cloud', that is, a time when through the will part of the proprium no faith accompanying charity, or truth and derivative good, appears, 
still less good and derivative truth. </p>

</p><b>1047.</b>
'Et erit in obnubilando Me nube super terram': quod significet quando propter proprium voluntarium hominis non apparet fides charitatis, constat ex illis quae mox supra dicta sunt de 'terra seu proprio 
voluntario hominis, quod nempe tale sit ut continue infundat in partem intellectualem hominis obscurum seu falsum quod est 'obnubilatio'; omnis falsitas est inde; quod satis manifeste constare potest 
ex eo quod amores sui et mundi qui sunt voluntatis hominis, non sint nisi odia, nam quantum quis semet amat tantum odit proximum; qui amores quia ita contrarii sunt amori caelesti: non potest quin 
continuo inde influant talia quae contraria sunt amori mutuo, quae omnia in parte intellectuali sunt falsitates, inde ejus omne obscurum et tenebrosum; falsum 'obnubilat' verum prorsus sicut obscura 
nubes lucem solis; et quia falsum et verum non possunt simul esse, sicut non tenebrae et lux; inde manifeste sequitur quod unum discedat veniente altero; et quia hoc per vices fit, ideo hic dicitur, 'in 
obnubilando nube terram,' hoc est, quando per proprium voluntarium non apparet fides charitatis, seu verum et inde bonum, minus bonum et inde verum. </p>
