<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2634节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2634.</strong>“照着神所吩咐他的”表照着神序。这从“神所吩咐的”或神的诫命的含义清楚可知。神的诫命，或神所吩咐的事就是构成神序的全部事物，无论总体还是细节；以致神序无非是神的永恒诫命。所以，照神的诫命生活，并活在神的诫命里面，就是照神序生活，并活在神序里面。正因如此，“照着神所吩咐的”意思就是照着神序。按照神序，凡男性都要在出生后第八天行割礼；这割礼本身没有任何效果，受割礼者不会优先于未受割礼者而进入神的国；但是，按照神序，由于在代表性教会中，这种宗教仪式对应于心里的洁净（蒙主怜悯，这种对应关系将在别处予以说明），故按照神序，内心，也就是人的内在当从存在于其欲望中的邪恶，和存在于这些欲望所产生的妄想中的虚假当中逐渐并不断被洁净。有关心里洁净的诫命就构成神序的全部事物，无论总体还是细节。因此，人越活在这些诫命里面，就越活在神序里面；越活在神序里面，他里面的一切事物，无论理性的还是记忆的，越被主照着起源于祂、存在于天堂的秩序而排列。人就这样变成对应于大天堂的小天堂。</p>

As God had commanded him. That this signifies according to Divine order, is evident from the signification of "God commanding," or of His precepts. God's precepts, or the things which God has commanded, 
are all things that are of Divine order both in general and in particular; so that Divine order is nothing but the perpetual precept of God; and therefore to live according to the precepts of God, 
and to live in the precepts of God, is to live according to Divine order and in Divine order. Hence it is that by "as God commanded," is signified according to Divine order. It was according to Divine 
order that every male should be circumcised on the eighth day from his birth; not that circumcision was of any avail, or that they who were circumcised would enter into the kingdom of God before the 
uncircumcised; but because in the representative church such a rite corresponded to the purification of the heart; which correspondence will of the Lord's Divine mercy be spoken of elsewhere. It is of 
Divine order that the heart, that is, man's interiors, should be purified gradually and continually from the evils of cupidities, and from the falsities of the phantasies thence derived. The precepts 
relating to the purification of the heart are all things of Divine order both in general and in particular. Insofar therefore as a man lives in those precepts, so far he lives in Divine order; and insofar 
as he lives in this, so far all things in him, both of reason and memory, are disposed by the Lord according to the order which is from Him in the heavens. Hence the man becomes a little heaven 
corresponding to the greatest. </p>

'As God had commanded' means according to Divine order. This is clear from the meaning of 'God commending' or of commandments. God's commandments, or the things which God has commanded, constitute Divine 
order wholly and in every single detail, so much so that Divine order is nothing else than the everlasting commandment of God. Consequently living according to God's commandments and within God's 
commandments is doing so according to Divine order and within Divine order. Hence the phrase used here - 'God commanded' - means according to Divine order. It was according to Divine order that every 
male should be circumcised on the eighth day after he had been born. It was not that circumcision in itself would accomplish anything or that those who had been circumcised would enter the kingdom of 
God before the uncircumcised did; but it was according to Divine order because such a religious practice in the representative Church corresponded to purification of the heart - which correspondence 
will in the Lord's Divine mercy be spoken of elsewhere. It is according to Divine order that the heart, that is, a person interiorly, should be purified gradually and constantly from the evils present 
in his desires and from the falsities present in the delusions resulting from those desires. Commandments concerning the purification of the heart constitute Divine order wholly and in every single detail. 
To the extent therefore that a person is living within those commandments he lives within Divine order; and to the extent he is living within Divine order, all that resides with him is arranged 
by the Lord according to the order, originating in Him, which exists in the heavens. That is to say, both the person's rational concepts and his factual knowledge are so arranged by Him. In this way 
a person becomes a miniature heaven corresponding to the larger one. </p>

`Quemadmodum praecepit Deus: quod significet secundum ordinem Divinum, constat ex significatione `praecipere Deus,' seu praeceptorum; praecepta Dei, seu quae praecepit Deus, sunt omnia et singula Divini 
ordinis, usque adeo ut Divinus ordo non sit nisi perpetuam praeceptum Dei; quare secundum praecepta Dei et in praeceptis Dei vivere, est secundum ordinem Divinum (c)et in ordine Divino; inde est 
quod per `praecepit Deus' hic significetur secundum ordinem Divinum. Secundum ordinem Divinum fuit quod omnis masculus a nativitate octavo die circumcideretur {1}, non quod circumcisio aliquid faceret, 
seu qui circumcisi, prae incircumcisis intrarent in regnum Dei; sed quia talis ritus in Ecclesia repraesentativa correspondebat purificationi cordis, de qua correspondentia, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, 
alibi dicetur: quod cor, hoc est, {2} interiora hominis, successive et continue a malis quae sunt cupiditatum et a falsis quae sunt phantasiarum inde, purificanda, est secundum ordinem Divinum, 
praecepta de purificatione cordis sunt omnia et singula ordinis Divini; quantum itaque homo in praeceptis illis, tantum in ordine Divino, vivit; et quantum in hoc, tantum apud eum omnia {3} a Domino 
disponuntur secundum ordinem qui ab Ipso in caelis, tam nempe ejus rationalia quam scientifica; inde fit homo exiguum caelum (t)correspondens maximo. 	@1 After masculus.$ 	@2 i quod.$ 	@3 omnia apud eum.$ </p>
