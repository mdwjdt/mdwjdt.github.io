<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1582.</strong>“你向左，我就向右；你向右，我就向左”表分离。这从“右”和“左”的含义清楚可知，右和左纯粹是相对的术语。它们并非确定的地区或确定的地方。这从以下事实明显可知：东和西，南和北既可在右，也可在左，这取决于人所面对的方向。位置也一样，迦南地既不能说在右，也不能说在左，除非是相对地。主在哪里，哪里就是中心，右和左取决于此。代表主的亚伯兰无论朝哪个方向退去，他都具有这种代表性。地区也是如此，无论亚伯兰是在迦南地，还是在别的地方。这就跟坐席一样，最高贵的人所坐的位置是最重要的，然后以此确定右边和左边的位置。因此，“向右或向左”是提供选择的一种形式，以此来表示分离。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1582.</strong> If to the left, I will go right, and if to the right, I will go left, symbolizes separation, as can be seen from the symbolism of right and left. Right or left is just relative direction. It is not a fixed quarter or a fixed place, as is evident from the fact that both east and west, both south and north can be on the right or the left, depending on the direction a person faces. The same is true of a location. The land of Canaan too could not have been described as being to the right or to the left except in a relative way.<br />Wherever the Lord is, that is the center; right and left are determined by it. The same was true of Abram, who represented the Lord. Whether he had gone off in one direction or the other, the representation would have stayed with him. The same was also true of the land; it would have been all the same, for instance, whether Abram had lived in the land of Canaan or elsewhere. Compare the situation of the highest ranking person at a table. The place where such a person sits is the head, and the other places are on the right or left accordingly. So speaking of going right or left was a standard way of expressing a choice, and it symbolized separation.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For another verse in which choice is expressed in terms of going right or left, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1582/bible_king-james-version_genesis_24_49" target=_top>Genesis 24:49</a> and Swedenborg's explanation of it in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1582/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3159" target=_top>3159</a>.

If to the left hand, then I will go to the right; and if to the right hand, then I will go to the left. That this signifies separation, is evident from the signification of "the right" and "the left." 
Right and left are merely relative terms. They do not designate a fixed quarter, or a definite place; as is evident from the fact that the east as well as the west, the south as well as the north, may 
be on the right or on the left, according to the way in which one is looking. The same is true also of place. The land of Canaan could not be said to be on the right or on the left, except relatively. 
Wherever the Lord is, there is the center; and the right and the left are determined from that. Thus whether Abram, by whom the Lord was represented, withdrew this way or that way, still the representation 
was with him, and so also was the land; so that it was the same thing whether Abram was in the land of Canaan, or was elsewhere; just as it is with the one at table who is of the highest dignity, 
the highest place is wherever he sits, and the places to the right and the left are reckoned from that. To go to the right or the left, was therefore a form of offering the choice by which there 
was signified separation. </p>

'If you go to the left then I will go to the right, and if you go to the right I will go to the left' means separation. This is clear from the meaning of 'the right' and of 'the left'. Right and left 
are purely relative terms, for neither of them is a definite region or definite place, as becomes clear from the fact that east and west, and south and north, can be to the right or to the left depending 
on the direction towards which a person is looking. So too with regard to a place. Nor could 'to the right' or 'to the left' be used of the land of Canaan except as relative terms. Wherever the Lord 
is, that is the centre, and right and left are reckoned from there. Thus whether Abram, who represented the Lord, moved in this direction or in that, his representative character went with him. And 
the same was true of the land, whether Abram was in the land of Canaan or whether he was somewhere else. It is like the most distinguished person at table. The place where he sits is the most important, 
and the other places are to the right and left of it 'Going to the right or to the left' therefore was a phrase expressing a right of choice and by which was meant separation </p>

</p><b>1582.</b>
'Si ad sinistram et ibo dextram, et si ad dextram et ibo sinistram': quod significet separationem, constat a significatione 'dextrae et sinistrae'; dextrum et sinistrum est nihil aliud quam respectivum 
quoddam, non est certa plaga, nec est certus locus, ut constare potest ex eo quod tam oriens quam occidens, tam meridies quam septentrio, possit esse a dextris, etiam a sinistris, secundum hominis 
aspectum; similiter se habet cum loco; 'terra Canaan' nec dici potuit a dextra nec a sinistra nisi respective: ubicumque Dominus est, ibi est centrum, inde dextrum et sinistrum; ita 'Abramus' per quem 
repraesentatus Dominus, sive huc sive illuc recesserit, usque tamen repraesentativum fuit apud illum, et quoque terra {1}; sicut quod perinde fuerit, si Abramus fuerit in terra Canaane vel si fuerit 
alibi; comparative sicut dignissimus ad mensam, locus ubi sedet est supremus, inde loca ad dextram et sinistram; quare 'ire ad dextram aut sinistram' erat formula optionis qua significata separatio. 	@1 
So I, but perhaps terram should be read.$ </p>
