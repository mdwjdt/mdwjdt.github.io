<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4504节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4504.</strong>“因为他们的妹子受了玷污”表他们违背信之真理。这从“玷污”和“妹子”的含义清楚可知：“玷污”是指违背；“妹子”是指真理（参看<a href="1495.htm">1495</a>，<a href="2508.htm">2508</a>，<a href="2524.htm">2524</a>，<a href="2556.htm">2556</a>，<a href="3386.htm">3386</a>节），在此是指信之真理，因为底拿，就是此处的妹子，表示对信的一切事物的情感（<a href="4427.htm">4427</a>节）。示剑玷污他们的妹子之所以表示他们违背信之真理，是因为她代表对一切真理的情感，因而教会本身（<a href="3963.htm">3963</a>，<a href="3964.htm">3964</a>节）。由于她的哥哥不让示剑娶她为妻，而是作为一个受到玷污者而与他们在一起，所以后来她和她哥哥一样代表反面，也就是说，代表对一切虚假的情感，因而代表败坏的教会；因此“他们的妹子受了玷污”这句话表示他们违背信之真理。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4504</b></p><p><b>4504.</b>
Because they had defiled their sister. That this signifies that they had befouled the truth of faith, is evident from the signification of "defiling," as being to befoul; and from the signification of 
a "sister," as being truth (see n. 1495, 2508, 2524, 2556, 3386), here the truth of faith, because by Dinah, who is here the sister, is signified the affection of all things of faith (n. 4427). The 
reason why Shechem's defiling of their sister signifies that they befouled the truth of faith, is that the affection of all truth, thus the church itself, is represented by her (n. 3963, 3964); and as 
she was not given by her brothers to Shechem for a woman, but remained with them defiled, therefore the opposite was afterwards represented by her as by her brothers, namely, the affection of all falsities, 
thus the church corrupted; so that the words "they had defiled their sister" signify that they had befouled the truth of faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4504</b></p><p><b>4504.</b>
'Because they had defiled their sister' means that they had violated the truth of faith. This is clear from the meaning of 'defiling' as violating, and from the meaning of 'a sister' as truth, dealt 
with in <a href="1495.htm">1495</a>, <a href="2508.htm">2508</a>, <a href="2524.htm">2524</a>, <a href="2556.htm">2556</a>, <a href="3386.htm">3386</a>, in this case the truth of faith because Dinah, to whom 'their sister' refers here, means the affection for all things of faith, <a href="4427.htm">4427</a>. The reason why Shechem's defilement 
of their sister means that they befouled the truth of faith is that she represents the affection for all truths, and so means the Church itself, <a href="3963.htm">3963</a>, <a href="3964.htm">3964</a>. And because she was not given by her 
brothers to Shechem as a wife but remained with them as one defiled, therefore like her brothers she subsequently had a contrary representation. That is to say, she represented the affection for all 
falsities, and so represented the corrupted Church. Consequently the statement that they defiled their sister means that they had violated the truth of faith. </p>

`Quod polluerint {1} sororem suam': quod significet quod verum fidei foedaverint, constat ex significatione `polluere' quod sit foedare; et ex significatione `sororis' quod sit verum, de qua n. 1495, 
2508, 2524, 2556, 3386, hic verum fidei quia per `Dinam' quae hic `soror,' significatur affectio omnium fidei, n. 4427.  Quod per `quod Shechemus polluerit sororem illorum' significetur quod illi 
foedaverint verum fidei, est quia per illam repraesentatur affectio verorum omnium, ita ipsa Ecclesia, n. 3963, 3964; et quia non data est (o)a fratribus ejus Shechemo in mulierem, sed polluta 
{2} apud illos remansit, (o)ideo postea per illam repraesentabatur oppositum sicut per fratres ejus, nempe affectio omnium falsorum, ita Ecclesia corrupta; inde est quod per `quod polluerint {3} sororem 
suam' significetur quod verum fidei foedaverint.      @1 polluerit AI, but see n. 4494, and Heb.$      @2 i illa$      @3 polluerit$ </p>
