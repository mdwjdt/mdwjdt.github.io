<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2382.</strong>“房门口的男人”表借以对仁之善诉诸暴力的理性事物和衍生的教义。这从“男人”、“门口”和“房”的含义清楚可知，“男人”是指理性事物（参看<a href="158.htm">158</a>，<a href="1007.htm">1007</a>节）；“门口”是指引入或进入，要么通向真理，要么通向良善，因而是指某种与教义相关之物（参看<a href="2356.htm">2356</a>节）；“房”（即家）是指仁之善（参看前文各处）。由于此处论述的主题是那些“要前来攻破房门”的人，也就是试图摧毁仁之善，以及主的神性与神圣这二者的人（<a href="2376.htm">2376</a>节），故所表示的是借以对仁之善诉诸暴力的理性事物和衍生的教义。</p>

And the men who were at the door of the house. That this signifies things rational and the derivative doctrinals, by which violence is offered to the good of charity, is evident from the signification 
of "men," as being things rational (see n. 158, 1007); from the signification of a "door," as being introduction or access, leading either to truth or to good, and thus what is doctrinal (see above, 
n. 2356); and from the signification of a "house," as being the good of charity (see above in various places). Here, because those are treated of who drew near to break open the door (that is, who attempted 
to destroy both the good of charity and the Divine and the Holy of the Lord, n. 2376), evil rational things are meant, and the derivative false doctrinals by which violence is inflicted on the 
good of charity. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2382</b></p><p><b>2382.</b>
'And the men who were at the door of the house' means rational concepts and matters of doctrine deriving from these by means of which violence is offered to good flowing from charity. This is clear from 
the meaning of 'the men' as rational concepts, dealt with in <a href="158.htm">158</a>, <a href="1007.htm">1007</a>; from the meaning of 'a door' as something that introduces or affords access, which leads either to truth or to good, and so 
means something to do with doctrine, dealt with above in <a href="2356.htm">2356</a>; and from the meaning of 'a house' as good that flows from charity, dealt with in various places. The subject here being those who 'came near 
to break down the door', that is, who tried to destroy the good of charity as well as the Lord's Divinity and His Holiness, <a href="2376.htm">2376</a>, rational concepts that are evil and derivative matters of doctrine 
that are false are meant, by means of which violence is offered to the good of charity. </p>

`Et viros, qui januae domus': quod significet rationalia et inde doctrinalia per quae vis infertur bono charitatis, constat a significatione `virorum' quod sint rationalia, de qua n. 158, 1007; a significatione 
`januae' quod sit introductio seu aditus {1}, qui ducit vel ad verum vel ad bonum, ita doctrinale, de qua supra n. 2356; et a significatione `domus' quod sit bonum charitatis, de qua supra 
passim: hic quia agitur de illis, qui `accesserunt ad effringendum ostium,' hoc est, qui conati destruere tam bonum charitatis quam Divinum et Sanctum Domini, n. 2376, intelliguntur rationalia mala 
et inde doctrinalia falsa, per quae vis infertur bono charitatis. 	@1 i primus.$ </p>
