<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10451节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10451</strong>.“两块法版在他手里”表具体和总体的主的圣言。这从“版”和“法版”的含义清楚可知：有十诫刻写在上面的“版”是指整体上的圣言（参看<a href="9416.htm">9416</a>节）；“法（版）”是指神性真理方面的主（参看<a href="9503.htm">9503</a>节）。这些版之所以表示整体上的圣言，无论具体地还是总体地，是因为生活的律法已经铭刻在它们上面；“律法”在严格意义上表示十诫，在不怎么严格的意义上表示摩西所写的圣言，在广泛意义上表示圣言的历史部分，在最广泛的意义上表示整部圣言（<a href="6752.htm">6752</a>节）。此外，由于律法写在这些版上所在的西乃山表示天堂，神性真理从天堂而来，并且摩西代表圣言，也就是来自的神性真理本身，所以摩西下来时手里所拿的版就象征着这种代表。</p>

And the two tables of the Testimony were in his hand. That this signifies the Word of the Lord in special and in general, is evident from the signification of "the tables" upon which the ten commandments 
were written, as being the Word in the whole complex (see n. 9416); and from the signification of "the Testimony," as being the Lord in respect to Divine truth (see n. 9503). The reason why by these 
tables is signified the Word in the whole complex, thus in special and in general, is that upon them was written the law of life, and by the law in a restricted sense are meant the ten commandments, 
in a less restricted sense is meant the Word written by Moses, in a broader sense the historic Word, and in the broadest sense the whole Word (n. 6752). Moreover, because Mount Sinai, where the law 
was written upon these tables, signified heaven, out of which comes Divine truth, and Moses represented the Word, which is Divine truth itself from the Lord, therefore as a sign of this representation 
the tables were in his hands. </p>

'And the two tablets of the Testimony were in his hand' means the Lord's Word specifically and generally. This is clear from the meaning of 'the tablets', on which the Ten Commandments had been inscribed, 
as the Word in its entirety, dealt with in <a href="9416.htm">9416</a>; and from the meaning of 'the Testimony' as the Lord in respect of Divine Truth, dealt with in <a href="9503.htm">9503</a>. The reason why the Word in its entirety, thus 
the Word specifically and generally, is meant by those 'tablets' is that the law of life had been inscribed on them, and 'the Law' is used in a restricted sense to mean the Ten Commandments, in a less 
restricted sense to mean the Word written by Moses, in a broad sense to mean the historical section of the Word, and in the broadest sense to mean the whole Word, see <a href="6752.htm">6752</a>. Also since Mount Sinai, where 
the Law had been written on those tablets, was a sign of heaven, from which Divine Truth comes, and since Moses represented the Word, which is authentic Divine Truth from the Lord, the presence of 
the tablets in his hand as he came down served to symbolize that representation.  </p>

`Et duae tabulae testimonii in manu ejus': quod significet Verbum Domini in specie et in genere, constat ex significatione `tabularum quibus inscripta fuerunt decem praecepta' quod sint Verbum in omni 
complexu, de qua n. 9416, et ex significatione `testimonii' quod sit Dominus quoad Divinum Verum, de qua n. 9503. Quod per `tabulas' illas significetur Verbum in omni complexu, ita in specie et in 
genere, est quia illis inscripta fuit lex vitae, et per legem in stricto sensu intelliguntur decem praecepta, in minus stricto intelligitur Verbum a Moscheh conscriptum, in latiore Verbum Historicum, 
et in latissimo totum Verbum, videatur n. 6752, {1}tum quia mons Sinai, ubi lex scripta fuit in tabulis illis, significabat caelum, e quo Divinum Verum, ac Moscheh repraesentabat Verbum, quod est ipsum 
Divinum Verum a Domino, ideo in ejus manu erant tabulae {2}, ut insigne {3}istius repraesentationis. @1 et$ @2 i , cum descendabat$ @3 ejus$ </p>
