<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第527节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>527.</strong>“拉麦”所表示的教会对真与善的直觉如此普通和模糊，以至于几乎荡然无存，因此它是一个荒废的教会，这一点从上下文清楚可知，因为下一节经文就有对它的描述。前一章的“拉麦”与这里的“拉麦”意思差不多，都表荒废（参阅第四章的18-19，23-24节）。生他的那位所取的名字也几乎一样，叫“玛土撒利”。因此，这些名字用来表示几近相同的事物，“玛土撒利”和“玛土撒拉”都意味着快要死亡的东西，而“拉麦”则意味着已被毁灭的东西。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]527.</strong> The symbolism of Lamech as a church whose perception of truth and goodness was so general and vague as to be almost nonexistent, so that it was a church devastated, is established by the preceding verses. What follows — since the next verse describes this church — establishes the same meaning again.<br />In the last chapter Lamech symbolized almost the same thing as here, namely, devastation. (For more on this subject, see the previous chapter at verses <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_527/bible_king-james-version_genesis_5_18" target=_top>18</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_527/bible_king-james-version_genesis_5_19" target=_top>19</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_527/bible_king-james-version_genesis_5_23-24" target=_top>23-24</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_527/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_404" target=_top>404-411</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_527/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_427" target=_top>427-432</a>].) The man who fathered him there had almost the same name — Methushael — so that the symbolism is almost the same as well. Methushael and Methuselah symbolize something that is dying, and Lamech something destroyed.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg seems to connect the names Methushael and Methuselah with the Hebrew word מוּת (mûṯ), "die." It is unclear with what Hebrew word, if any, he might be associating "Lamech." [LHC] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 527</b></p><p><b>527.</b>
That by "Lamech" is signified a church wherein the perception of truth and good was so general and obscure as to be next to none, consequently a church vastated, appears from what was said in the preceding 
chapter, and from what follows in the next verse. "Lamech" in the preceding chapter has nearly the same signification as in this, namely, vastation (concerning which see Gen. 4:18, 19, 23, 24); 
and he who begat him is also called by nearly the same name, "Methuselah" so that the things signified by the names are nearly the same. By "Methuselah" and "Methuselah" is signified something that is 
about to die; and by "Lamech" what is destroyed. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 527</b></p><p><b>527.</b>
That Lamech means a Church in which the perception of truth and good was so general and vague as to be almost none at all, and so it was a vastated Church, becomes clear from what has gone before and 
from what follows, for the very next verse contains a description of it. In the previous chapter 'Lamech' had almost the same meaning as he does here, namely vastation; see verses 18, 19, 23, 24, of 
that chapter. And the one who beget him even bore a similar name, which was Methusael. Consequently things that were almost the same were meant by these names; Methusael and Methuselah both mean something 
that is about to die, while Lamech means that which has been destroyed.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 527</b>
</p><b>527.</b>
Quod per 'Lamech' significetur Ecclesia in qua tam communis et obscura perceptio veri et boni fuit ut fere nulla, ita Ecclesia vastata, constare potest ab illis quae praecedunt et ab illis quae sequuntur, 
nam describitur in versu mox sequente. 'Lamech' in praecedente capite significabat fere simile sicut hic, nempe vastationem, de qua videatur cap. praec. ad vers. 18, 19, 23, 24; et a quo genitus 
etiam paene similiter nominatur, nempe Methushael, sic ut significata sint per nomina fere similia: per 'Methushael et Methushelah' moribundum quoddam; per 'Lamech' deletum. </p>
