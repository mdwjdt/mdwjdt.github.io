<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10362节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10362</strong>.“凡干犯这日的”表被自我和人自己的爱引导，而不是被主引导。这从“干犯安息日”的含义清楚可知，“干犯安息日”或在安息日作工是指被自我，而非主引导，因而被人自己的爱引导。这就是“干犯安息日”的意思，这一点清楚可见于以赛亚书：<br />你若从安息日掉转你的脚步，在我的圣日不按自己的意思去行，不行自己的路，不寻求自己的情欲，不说自己的话。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛58.13.htm">58:13</a>）<br />“从安息日掉转脚步”表示放弃诸如属于属世人的那类事物；“按自己的意思去行”表示做支持私欲和爱自己爱世界之邪恶的事；“行自己的路”表示做支持邪恶之虚假的事；“寻求自己的情欲”表示照这些爱的快乐生活；“说自己的话”表示思想这些事。由此明显可知，“干犯安息日”表示被自我和人自己的爱引导，而不是被主引导；就至高意义而言，主就是安息日，如刚才所示。<br />类似的事由安息日所作的工来表示，如砍柴、生火、准备食物、收割等等，这些事在安息日都是禁止人们去做的；这一切都具有相同的含义。“砍柴”表示被自我引导去做善事；“生火”表示出于人自己的爱去做善事；而“准备食物”表示通过自己的聪明教导自己。若不借助内义，没有人能知道上面提到的这些禁令意味着这些事。<br />要进一步知道，被自我引导和被主引导是两个对立面。凡被自我引导的人都是被自己的爱引导，因而被地狱引导，因为人自己的爱就来源于地狱。凡被主引导的人就被天堂的爱，也就是对主之爱和对邻之爱引导。一个被这些爱引导的人就被引离他自己的爱，而一个被自己的爱引导的人则被引离天堂的爱；因为人自己的爱与天堂的爱根本不一致。一个人的生命要么在天堂，要么在地狱；它不可能既在这一个里面，同时又在那一个里面。这就是主在马太福音中所说这些话的意思：<br />一个人不能事奉两个主。不是恶这个爱那个，就是依附这个轻视那个。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太6.24.htm">6:24</a>）<br />由此明显可知在安息日作工是什么意思。</p>

He that profaneth it. That this signifies to be led by one's self and one's own loves, and not by the Lord, is evident from the signification of "profaning the Sabbath," or doing work on the Sabbath 
day, as being to be led by one's self and not by the Lord, thus by one's own loves. That this is signified by "profaning the Sabbath," is evident in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, 
so that thou doest not thine inclinations on the day of My holiness, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own desire, nor speaking a word (Isa. 58:13). To "turn away the foot from the 
Sabbath" denotes such things as are of the natural man; "doing one's own inclinations" denotes doing those things which favor the cupidities and evils of the loves of self and of the world; "doing one's 
own ways" denotes favoring the falsities of evil; "finding one's own desire" denotes living according to the delights of these loves; and "speaking a word" denotes thinking such things. From this it 
is evident that by "profaning the Sabbath" is signified being led by one's self and one's own loves, and not by the Lord, who in the supreme sense is "the Sabbath," as has been shown just above.  [2] 
Like things are signified by "works on the Sabbath day," such as cutting wood, kindling a fire, then preparing food, by gathering in the harvest, and many other things which were forbidden to be done 
on the Sabbath day. By "cutting wood" is signified doing good from one's self; by "kindling a fire" is signified doing it from one's own loves; and by "preparing food," teaching one's self from one's 
own intelligence. No one can know that such things are involved in these prohibitions except from the internal sense. [3] Be it known further that to be led by self, and to be led by the Lord, are 
two opposites; for he who is led by himself is led by his own loves, thus by hell, because man's own loves are from hell; and he who is led by the Lord is led by the loves of heaven, which are love to 
the Lord and love toward the neighbor. He who is led by these loves is withdrawn from his own loves; and he who is led by his own loves is withdrawn from the loves of heaven, because they by no means 
agree together; for the life of man is either in heaven or in hell. It is not possible that it be at the same time in one and in the other. This is meant by the Lord's words in Matthew: </p>
<p>     No one 
can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will cleave to the one, and slight the other (Matt. 6:24). From all this it is evident what is signified by "doing 
work on the Sabbath day." </p>

'He who profanes it' means being led by self and one's own loves, and not by the Lord. This is clear from the meaning of 'profaning the sabbath', or doing work on the sabbath day, as being led by self 
and not by the Lord, thus by one's own loves. That this is what 'profaning the sabbath' means is clear in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
If you turn you foot away from the sabbath, so that you do not do your own will 
on My holy day, and do not do your own ways, and do not find your own desire and speak [your own] words ... <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2058:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 58:13</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Turning one's foot away from the sabbath' means forsaking such things as belong 
to the natural man. 'Doing one's own will' means doing that which is favourable to selfish desires and the evils of self-love and love of the world. 'Doing one's own ways' means doing that which 
is favourable to the falsities of evil. 'Finding one's own desire' means leading a life that accords with the delights that belong to those types of love, and 'speaking [one's own] words' thinking such 
things. From all this it is evident that 'profaning the sabbath' means being led by self and one's own loves, and not by the Lord, who in the highest sense is the sabbath, as shown just above.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
The like is meant by the kinds of work, such as cutting wood, lighting a fire, preparing food then, gathering in the harvest, and many other kinds, which people were prohibited from doing on the sabbath 
day; all these had a like meaning. 'Cutting wood' meant being led by self to do what was good; 'lighting a fire' meant being inflamed to do it by their own selfish loves; and 'preparing food' meant 
teaching themselves by means of their own intelligence. No one can know except from the internal sense that these prohibitions which have been mentioned imply such things.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 It should in addition 
be remembered that being led by self and being led by the Lord are two opposites. Someone who is led by self is led by his own loves, and so by hell since the loves that are a person's own originate 
there; but someone who is led by the Lord is led by heaven's loves, which are love to the Lord and love towards the neighbour. One who is led by these loves is allured away from selfish loves, whereas 
one who is led by selfish loves is allured away from heaven's loves; for selfish loves agree in no way at all with heaven's loves. A person's life is located either in heaven or in hell; it is impossible 
for it to be in one and at the same time in the other. This is how the Lord's words in Matthew should be understood,  </p>
<blockquote>
No one can serve two lords, for either he will hate the one and love 
the other, or he will cling to the one and disregard the other. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%206:24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 6:24</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>From all this it is evident what 'doing work on the sabbath day' means.  </p>

`Profanans illud': quod significet duci a semet et suis amoribus, et non a Domino, constat ex significatione `profanare sabbatum' seu opus facere die sabbati, quod sit duci a semet {1} et non a Domino, 
ita a suis amoribus; quod (d)hoc per `profanare sabbatum' significetur, constat apud Esaiam, 	Si {2}averteris a sabbato pedem tuum, {3}ut non facias voluntates tuas in die sanctitatis Meae, et non 
facias vias tuas, nec invenias desiderium tuum, et loquaris verbum, lviii 13; </p>
<p>`avertere pedem a sabbato' est talia quae sunt naturalis hominis, `facere voluntates suas' est facere quae {4}favent cupiditatibus 
ac malis amorum sui et mundi, `facere vias suas' est favere falsis mali, `invenire desiderium suum' est vivere secundum jucunda amorum illorum, et `loqui verbum' est cogitare talia; inde patet 
quod per `profanare sabbatum' significetur duci a semet et a suis amoribus, et non a Domino, Qui in supremo sensu est sabbatum, ut mox supra [2] ostensum est; similia significantur per opera die 
sabbati, {5}ut per (t)secare ligna, accendere ignem, parare cibum tunc, colligere messem, et per plura quae facere die sabbati {6}interdictum erat; per quae etiam similia significata sunt, per ligna secare 
operari bonum a (m)semet, per ignem accendere id facere ex propriis amoribus, et per cibum parare semet docere {7}ex intelligentia propria,(n) quod talia involverint memoratae illae interdictiones, 
nemo nisi ex sensu interno scire potest. Porro sciendum quod duci a semet et duci a Domino {8}sint duo [3] opposita, qui {9}enim a semet ducitur, is ducitur a suis amoribus, ita ab inferno, nam proprii 
amores (x)hominis sunt inde; {10}et qui ducitur a Domino, is ducitur ab amoribus caeli, qui sunt amor in Dominum et amor erga proximum; qui ab his amoribus ducitur, (c)is subducitur {11}ab amoribus 
propriis, {10}et qui ducitur ab {12}amoribus propriis, is subducitur ab amoribus caeli, nullatenus enim concordant; hominis enim vita, vel est in caelo vel est in inferno, non datur {13}ut sit simul 
in uno et in altero; hoc intelligitur per Domini verba apud Matthaeum, 	Nemo potest duobus dominis servire, nam aut unum odio habebit et alterum amabit, aut uni adhaerebit et alterum negliget, vi 
24; </p>
<p>ex his patet quid per `opus facere die sabbati' significatur. @1 i et  suis amoribus,$ @2 avertes$ @3 et$ @4 favent altered to favere$ @5 sicut$ @6 interdicta sunt; et per quae etiam significantur
