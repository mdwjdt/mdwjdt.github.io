<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5109.</strong>创世记40:9-13.酒政长便将他的梦告诉约瑟，对他说，在梦里我看见我面前有一棵葡萄树。葡萄树上有三根枝子，好像发了芽、开了花，结出串串成熟的葡萄。法老的杯在我手中，我就拿葡萄挤在法老的杯里，将杯递在法老手掌中。约瑟对他说，你所作的梦是这样解：三根枝子就是三天，三天之内，法老必使你抬起头来，恢复你原来的职位，你仍要将法老的杯递在他手中，像先前做他酒政时一样。<br />“酒政长便将他的梦告诉约瑟”表属灵层的属天层觉知受心智的理解力部分支配，至今仍被抛弃的感官印象会是什么结果。“对他说”表由觉知所带来的启示。“在梦里”表预言。“我看见我面前有一棵葡萄树”表理解力部分。“葡萄树上有三根枝子”表由此甚至直到最末层的衍生物。“好像发了芽”表使重生得以实现的流注。“开了花”表接近重生的状态。“结出串串成熟的葡萄”表属灵真理与属天良善的结合。“法老的杯在我手中”表内层属世层进入外层属世层的流注，以及接受的开始。“我就拿葡萄挤在法老的杯里”表进入拥有属灵源头的善行中的相互流注。“将杯递在法老手掌中”表内层属世层将这些变成自己的。“约瑟对他说，你所作的梦是这样解”表就它里面所包含的东西而言，由通过属世层里面的属天层得来的觉知所产生的启示。“三根枝子就是三天”表连续不断的衍生物，甚至直到最后的衍生物。“三天之内”表那时，一个新状态就会到来。“法老必使你抬起头来”表已经预备并因此决定的事。“恢复你原来的职位”表经由受理解力部分支配的感官所得来的印象恢复次序，好叫它们占据末位或最低位置。“你仍要将法老的杯递在他手中”表好叫它们能由此服侍内层属世层。“像先前一样”表符合次序的法则。“做他酒政时”表这是这种感官印象的正常位置。</p>

Verses 9-13. And the prince of the butlers told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream behold a vine was before me; and in the vine were three shoots, and it was as though it budded, its blossom 
went up, and the clusters thereof ripened grapes. And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup upon the palm of Pharaoh. And 
Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it; The three shoots three days are these. In yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head, and shall bring thee back upon thy station, and thou shalt 
give Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler. "And the prince of the butlers told his dream to Joseph," signifies that the celestial of the spiritual perceived 
the event concerning those things which were of the sensuous subject to the intellectual part, and which had hitherto been rejected; "and said to him," signifies revelation from perception; "In my dream," 
signifies prediction; "behold a vine was before me," signifies the intellectual part; "and in the vine were three shoots," signifies the derivations thence even to the last; "and it was as though 
it budded," signifies the influx by which the rebirth is effected; "its blossom went up," signifies the state near regeneration; "and the clusters thereof ripened grapes," signifies conjunction of spiritual 
truth with celestial good; "and Pharaoh's cup was in my hand," signifies the influx of the interior natural into the exterior, and the beginning of reception; "and I took the grapes, and pressed 
them into Pharaoh's cup," signifies reciprocal influx into the goods from a spiritual origin there; "and I gave the cup upon the palm of Pharaoh," signifies appropriation by the interior natural; 
"and Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it," signifies revelation from perception from the celestial in the natural as to what it had in itself; "the three shoots three days are these," 
signifies continuous derivations down to the last one; "in yet three days," signifies that there would then be a new state; "shall Pharaoh lift up thy head," signifies what is provided, and hence what 
is concluded; "and shall bring thee back upon thy station," signifies that the things which are of the sensuous subject to the intellectual part would be reduced into order, that they might be in the 
last place; "and thou shalt give Pharaoh's cup into his hand," signifies that thereby they may serve the interior natural; "after the former manner," signifies in accordance with the law of order; "when 
thou wast his butler," signifies as is usual with sensuous things of this kind. </p>

Verses 9-13 And the chief of the cupbearers told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, and behold, a vine before me. And on the vine three shoots, and it was as though budding; its blossom 
came up, and its clusters ripened into grapes. And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and put the cup onto Pharaoh's palm. And Joseph said to him, 
This is the interpretation of it: The three shoots are three days. In yet three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and will restore you to your position, and you will put Pharaoh's cup into his hand, 
according to the former manner when you were his cupbearer. </p>
<p>'And the chief of the cupbearers told his dream to Joseph' means that the celestial of the spiritual discerned what the outcome would 
be for the sensory impressions subject to the understanding part of the mind, which until then had been cast aside. 'And said to him' means revelation resulting from perception. 'In my dream' means 
a foretelling. 'And behold, a vine before me' means the understanding part. 'And on the vine three shoots' means derivatives from this even to the final one. 'And it was as though budding' means an influx 
that allows rebirth to be effected. 'Its blossom came up' means the state next to regeneration. 'And its clusters ripened into grapes' means spiritual truth when joined to celestial good. 'And Pharaoh's 
cup was in my hand' means an influx of the interior natural into the exterior natural, and the beginning of reception. 'And I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup' means a reciprocal 
influx into good deeds that have a spiritual origin. 'And put the cup onto Pharaoh's palm' means that the interior natural made these its own. 'And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation 
of it' means revelation resulting from perception received from the celestial within the natural as to what it held within it. 'The three shoots are three days' means continuous derivatives even to the 
final one. 'In yet three days' means that at that point a new state is arrived at. 'Pharaoh will lift up your head' means that which has been provided and therefore decided. 'And will restore you to 
your position' means that the impressions received through the senses subject to the understanding part were restored to order, to occupy the lowest position. 'And you will put Pharaoh's cup into his 
hand' means in order that they might consequently serve the interior natural. 'According to the former manner' means in keeping with the law of order. 'When you were his cupbearer' means as is the normal 
position for sensory impressions of this kind. </p>

Vers. 9-13.  Et narravit princeps pincernarum somnium suam Josepho, et dixit ei, In somnio meo, et ecce vitis coram me.  Et in vite tres propagines, et illa sicut germinans, ascendit flos illius, 
et maturuerunt botri illius, uvas.  Et scyphus Pharaonis in manu mea, et accepi uvas, et expressi illas ad scyphum Pharaonis, et dedi scyphum super volam Pharaonis.  Et dixit illi Joseph, Haec interpretatio 
illius; tres propagines tres dies illae.  In adhuc tribus diebus extollet Pharaoh caput tuum et reducet te super stationem tuam, et dabis scyphum Pharaonis in manum illius, secundum morem 
priorem, quo fuisti pincerna illius. `Et narravit princeps pincernarum somnium suum Josepho' significat quod caeleste spiritualis apperciperet eventum de illis quae fuerunt sensualis parti intellectuali 
subjecti, quae hactenus rejecta: `et dixit ei significat revelationem ex perceptione: `In somnio meo' significat praedictionem `et ecce vitis coram me' significat intellectuale: </p>
<p>`et in vite 
tres propagines' significat derivationes inde usque ad ultimam: `et illa sicut germinans' significat influxum per quem renascentia: `ascendit flos illius' significat statum prope regenerationem: `et 
maturuerunt botri illius, uvas' significat conjunctionem veri spiritualis cum bono caelesti: `et scyphus Pharaonis in manu mea' significat influxum interioris naturalis in exterius, et receptionis 
initium: `et accepi uvas, et expressi illas ad scyphum Pharaonis' significat influxum reciprocum in bona ex origine spirituali ibi: `et dedi scyphum super volam Pharaonis' significat appropriationem 
ab interiore naturali: `et dixit illi Josephi, Haec interpretatio illius' significat revelationem a perceptione a caelesti in naturali quid in se haberet: `tres propagines tres dies illae' significat 
derivationes continuas usque ad ultimam: `in adhuc tribus diebus' significat quod tunc novum: </p>
<p>extollet Pharaoh caput tuum' significat provisum et inde conclusum: </p>
<p>`et reducet te super stationem 
tuam' significat quod illa quae sunt sensualis parti intellectuali subjecti, redigerentur in ordinem, ut ultimo loco sint: `et dabis scyphum Pharaonis in manum illius' significat ut inde inserviant 
interiori naturali: `secundum morem priorem' significat ex lege ordinis: `quo fuisti pincerna illius' significat sicut sensualia illius generis solent. </p>
