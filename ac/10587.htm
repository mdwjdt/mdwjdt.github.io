<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10587节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10587</strong>.他们首先谈论了他们星球的人所用的语言形式。他们说，他们星球的人通过一种内在途径彼此交谈，和通过一种外在途径交谈的其他人不一样。这涉及到空气和视觉的使用，通过以下方式实现：他们在自己里面思考，所思想的观念通过一种柔和的流动传给别人；这种柔和的流动通过一种除了解剖学家外，我们星球上所不知道的途径进入耳朵的内在部分。因为口腔内有一条通道，被称为咽鼓管；它在口腔中开口，终止于耳腔，并被包裹在一层薄膜中。通过呼吸和发出轻微的声音所吸入的空气轻轻地流过这条通道，思维的话语便以这种方式得以传达。就像刚才说的，这涉及空气的使用。这些灵人继续说，当以这种方式彼此交谈时，他们也以一种总体和具体的方式移动嘴唇；他们用嘴唇作出的这些细微动作一直延伸到眼睛，尤其左眼；他们的内在思维及其生命力就在此显现。如刚才所述，这涉及视觉的使用。由此明显可知，他们的脸与思维行如一体；因为脸是为了表达和表现人的所思所爱而形成的。脸也由此被称为心灵的标志或心灵的反映。但这只适用于诚实的人，不适用于不诚实的人，伪君子和假冒为善者。为向我证明这一事实，他们被允许以同样的方式移动我的嘴唇，然后我被允许通过这种移动和思维之间的和谐来觉察他们的思维对象是什么。我问他们，他们星球上是否有人在说话时使用听得见的话语或发音。他们说，他们不知道什么叫发音，但他们知道什么叫声音。听到这些话，我明白他们为什么被带到火星灵那里，在来到我这里之前先与他们联合。因为他们所用的语言很相似，这从前面论述火星的居民和灵人的地方（<a href="7359.htm">7359</a>-<a href="7362.htm">7362</a>节）可以看出来。</p>

The discourse at first was about their speech on their own earth. They said that they discourse together among themselves by an internal way; and not like others by an external way; and this by means 
of the atmosphere, and by means of sight, which is effected in the following way. They think within themselves, and the ideas of thought are communicated to the other by a certain flowing into the interiors 
of the ears by a way unknown on this earth, although it is known to those who are learned in anatomy. For there is a certain canal within the mouth, called the Eustachian tube, which is open in 
the mouth, and ends in the chamber of the ear, and is encompassed with a thin membrane. Through this channel the air of the breath inflows with a gentle sound, and so the speaking thought is communicated. 
As already said, this is effected by means of the atmosphere. Moreover, when they are speaking among themselves in this way they also move the lips both in general and in particular, and these 
little motions advance toward the eyes, especially toward the left eye, and their interior thought and its life there manifests itself. As before said, this is effected by means of sight. From this it 
was evident that their face acts as a one with their thoughts; for the face has been wholly formed to portray and represent the things the man is thinking and loving. From this the face is also called 
the index of the mind. But this is the case with the sincere; but it is very different with the insincere, with pretenders, and with hypocrites. To confirm me that such is the case, they were allowed 
to move my lips and my face in a similar way; and then to perceive the objects of their thought by means of the accordance. They were asked whether any speak there by means of sonorous words, or articulated 
sound. They said that they do not know what is meant by the articulation of sound, but that they know what sound is. On hearing these things, I perceived the reason why they were conducted to 
the spirits of the earth Mars, and were consociated with them before they came to me; for a similar speech prevails among them, as can be seen where the inhabitants and spirits of Mars have been treated 
of (n. 7359-7362). </p>

First they talked about the form of speech used by people on their planet. They said that people converse with one another by an inward way, unlike others who do so by an outward one. It involves the 
use of the air and of sight, and is accomplished in the following manner: They think within themselves, and the ideas they think are conveyed to another by a sort of gentle streaming into the inner parts 
of the ears by a route unknown on our planet except to experts in anatomy. For there is a certain passage inside the mouth, called the Eustachian tube, which is open in the mouth, terminates in the 
cavity within the ear, and is encased in a thin membrane. Air taken in by breathing and making a slight sound streams gently through this passage, and in this way the utterance of thought is conveyed. 
This involves the use of the air, as has just been said. Those spirits went on to say that when they are talking to one another in this way they also move their lips, in both a general and a particular 
way; and the tiny movements that they make with them reach up to the eyes, especially the left eye. Here their inner thought and its vitality reveal themselves. This involves the use of sight, as 
has just been said. From this it was evident that their face acted in unison with their thought; for the face has been formed to express and represent what the person thinks and loves. (Therefore also 
the face is called the indicator of the mind, though this applies only to those who are honest, not to those who are dishonest, dissemblers, and hypocrites.) To prove the truth of this to me they were 
allowed to move my lips and face in a similar way, and [I was allowed] to perceive through the harmony between movement and thought what the objects of their thought were. I asked them whether any 
on their planet used audible words or articulated sounds when they spoke. They said they did not know what the articulation of sounds was, though they did know what a sound was. Having heard them say 
these things I could see why they had been guided to the spirits belonging to Mars, to mix with them before they came to me. For they use a similar kind of speech, as may be seen where the speech of 
the inhabitants and spirits of that planet was the subject, in <a href="7359.htm">7359</a>-<a href="7362.htm">7362</a>.  </p>

Sermo fuit primum de loquela eorum in sua tellure; dicebant quod consocient sermonem inter se per viam internam, et non sicut alii per externam, ac id media atmosphaera et medio visu; quod fit hoc modo: 
 cogitant intra se, ac ideae cogitationis communicantur alteri per quendam illapsum in interiora aurium, per viam ignotam in hac tellure, sed usque notam eruditis anatomicis; est enim quidam canalis 
intra os, qui vocatur tuba Eustachiana, qui apertus est in ore et terminatur in auris conclavi, et circumductus est tenui membrana; per illum canalem illabitur sub tenui sono aer respiratorius, et 
sic communicatur cogitatio loquens; hoc fit media atmosphaera, ut dictum est; porro cum loquuntur ita inter se, etiam movent labia, tam in communi quam in particulari; et motiunculae illae progrediuntur 
versus oculos, imprimis versus oculum sinistrum, et ibi interior eorum cogitatio, et ejus vitale se manifestat; hoc fit medio visu, ut dictum est.  Inde patuit quod facies eorum unum agat cum eorum 
cogitatione, facies enim prorsus formata est ad effigiandum et repraesentandum illa quae homo cogitat et amat; inde etiam facies vocatur index animi; sed hoc fit apud sinceros, aliter vero apud insinceros, 
simulatores, et hypocritas.  Ut confirmarer quod ita esset, dabatur illis similiter movere mea labia et meam faciem, et tunc per concordantiam percipere cogitationis eorum objecta.  Interrogabantur 
num ibi aliqui loquerentur per voces sonoras seu sonum articulatum; dicebant quod nesciant quid articulatum soni, sed quod sciant quid sonus.  His auditis appercepi causam cur ad spiritus telluris 
Martis deducti fuerint, et cum illis consociati antequam ad me venirent; est enim similis loquela apud illos, de qua videatur ubi de incolis et spiritibus illius telluris, n. 7359-7362 actum est. </p>
