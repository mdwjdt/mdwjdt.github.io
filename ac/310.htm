<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第310节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>310.</strong>本节的每个字皆蕴含诸多奥秘，适用于被洪水灭亡的人，他们的秉性与洪水后的人截然不同。要将这些奥秘全部揭示出来是不可能的，就让我略说一二。他们的第一代祖先，亦即构成上古教会的人，都是属天之人，故有属天之种在内。他们的后代因而也有属天之种在内，凭着该属天之种，爱主导整个心智，使之一体不分。因为人的心智由两部分构成，一为意志，一为觉性。爱和良善与意志相关，信和真理与觉性相关。上古之人凭爱和良善能觉知信和真理，故其心智是一体不分的。<br />他们的后代留有属天之种在内，他们若偏离真理和良善，会极其危险，因为他们的整个心智都会颠倒。等到了灵界，要将他们颠倒的心智复原，几乎是不可能的。<br />洪水后的人乃至今日之人内无属天之种，只有属灵之种，他们的情况就不同。因为他们没有爱，没有行善之志，只有信之能，亦即悟解真理之能。凭此，他们能被引生某种程度的仁爱，尽管这是经由不同的途径，是凭主藉真理之知及其衍生的良善而引入的良知。因此，他们的状态与洪水前的人大不相同。关于该状态，因主的慈悲，我会在后文加以阐述。<br />这些奥秘完全不为现代人所知，因今日之人不知何为属天之人，甚至不知何为属灵之人，对于人的心智和由它产生的生活并死后的状态更是一无所知。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]310.</strong> Each word of this verse [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_310/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_24" target=_top>Genesis 3:24</a>] holds such deep secrets that they could never be uncovered. They relate to the inborn character of the people who were destroyed in the Flood, a character completely different from that of the people living after the Flood.<br />Let me say just a little about it. The most distant ancestors of this generation, who formed the earliest church, had a heavenly character and so were sown with heavenly seed. Their descendants consequently had in them seed from a heavenly source. Because of its heavenly source, the nature of this seed is to cause love to reign throughout the whole mind and unify it.<br />The human mind has two parts: will and intellect. The will holds love or goodness, the intellect holds faith or truth. From love (goodness) the people of that time perceived what belonged to faith (to truth), so that their minds were unified. The offspring of such people keep the same seed inside them, which is perilous if they turn away from truth and goodness, because they then corrupt their whole mind to such an extent that it can hardly be restored in the other life.<br />[2] The situation is different for people who do not have heavenly but instead spiritual seed inside them — those living after the Flood, for example, and those who live in modern times. Such people have no love and therefore no will to do good. Faith is still possible, though; in other words, they are able to comprehend truth. Faith or an understanding of truth can lead them to a kind of charity, although they arrive at it by another way. Their way lies through conscience, which is instilled in them by the Lord and is formed out of a knowledge of truth and of the good that results from it. So their circumstances are radically different from those of the people who predated the Flood. Those circumstances will be described later [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_310/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_398" target=_top>398</a>], the Lord in his divine mercy willing.<br />These are secrets wholly unknown to people today. No one today has any idea what a heavenly person is or even what a spiritual one is, let alone what the implications are for the nature of the human mind and mortal life or for the resulting conditions after death. </p>

Each particular expression in this verse involves so many arcana of deepest import (applicable to the genius of this people who perished by the flood, a genius totally different from that of those who 
lived subsequent to the flood), that it is impossible to set them forth. We will briefly observe that their first parents, who constituted the Most Ancient Church, were celestial men, and consequently 
had celestial seeds implanted in them; whence their descendants had seed in them from a celestial origin. Seed from a celestial origin is such that love rules the whole mind and makes it a one. For 
the human mind consists of two parts, the will and the understanding. Love or good belongs to the will, faith or truth to the understanding; and from love or good those most ancient people perceived 
what belongs to faith or truth, so that their mind was a one. With the posterity of such a race, seed of the same celestial origin necessarily remains, so that any falling away from truth and good on 
their part is most perilous, since their whole mind becomes so perverted as to render a restoration in the other life scarcely possible. It is otherwise with those who do not possess celestial but only 
spiritual seed, as did the people after the flood, and as also do the people of the present day. There is no love in these, consequently no will of good, but still there is a capability of faith, or 
understanding of truth, by means of which they can be brought to some degree of charity, although by a different way, namely, by the insinuation of conscience from the Lord grounded in the knowledges 
of truth and the derivative good. Their state is therefore quite different from that of the antediluvians, concerning which state, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. These are arcana with which the 
present generation are utterly unacquainted, for at the present day none know what the celestial man is nor even what the spiritual man is, and still less what is the quality of the human mind and life 
thence resulting, and the consequent state after death. </p>

Each word in this verse embodies so many very deep arcana that all cannot possibly be disclosed. These arcana are applicable to the disposition of those people who perished in the Flood, a disposition 
which was entirely different from that of the people who lived after the Flood. In short, their earliest forefathers, who constituted the Most Ancient Church, were celestial people, and so had celestial 
seed planted within them. Consequently their descendants had seed within themselves which had a celestial origin. Seed which has a celestial origin entails love ruling the whole mind and unifying 
it. For the human mind consists of two parts, will and understanding. To the will belongs love, or good, and to the understanding faith, or truth. From love or good they perceived what was a matter of 
faith or a matter of truth, so that their mind was one. When people are of this nature that seed which has a celestial origin remains with their descendants. But if the latter recede from truth and 
good, it is extremely dangerous, for they so corrupt the whole of their mind that it can scarcely be restored in the next life.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It is different with people who do not have celestial but spiritual 
seed within them, as was the case with the people after the Flood and with those living today. They have no love within them, and so no will for good; but they can be given faith, or understanding 
of truth. From faith or an understanding of truth they can be guided into some form of charity, but it is by a different route, by a conscience implanted by the Lord and acquired from cognitions of truth 
and good arising from it. Consequently their state is entirely different from that of people before the Flood. This state will in the Lord's Divine mercy be described later on. These are the arcana 
which are totally unknown to people nowadays, for nowadays people do not know what the celestial man is, nor even what the spiritual man is, let alone the consequent nature of man's mind and life, 
and his consequent state after death.  </p>

Singula verba hujus versus arcanissima tanta involvunt ut nusquam exponi possint, applicabilia ad genium populi hujus qui diluvio periit, qui genius prorsus diversus fuit a genio eorum qui post diluvium 
vixerunt: ut paucis modo dicatur, primi eorum parentes qui Antiquissimam Ecclesiam constituerunt, caelestes fuerunt, ita illis semina caelestia inseminata fuerunt; inde posteri eorum semen ex caelesti 
origine apud se habuerunt; semen ex caelesti origine tale est quod amor regat totam mentem, et unam facit. Mens enim humana ex binis partibus constat, ex voluntate et intellectu; voluntatis est amor 
seu bonum, intellectus est fides, seu verum; ex amore seu bono, percipiebant quid fidei aut quid veri, ita una mens erat; cum tales sunt, apud posteros manet semen inde, qui si declinant a vero et 
bono periculosissimum est, sic enim totam suam mentem pervertunt ut in altera vita vix possit restitui. Aliter, quibus non semen caeleste sed semen spirituale inest, sicut postdiluvianis et iis qui hodie 
vivunt, iis nullus est amor, ita nulla voluntas boni, sed usque dari potest fides, seu intellectus veri; ex fide, seu intellectu veri, perduci possunt ad charitatem quandam, sed per aliam viam et 
quidem per insinuatam a Domino conscientiam ex cognitionibus veri et boni inde; quare est status eorum prorsus alius quam fuit status antediluvianorum; de quo statu, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in 
sequentibus dicetur. Haec sunt arcana, quae homini hodie prorsus ignota sunt; nam hodie non sciunt quid caelestis homo, ne quidem quid spiritualis, minus qualis inde mens et vita hominis, et inde status 
post mortem. </p>
