<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8815节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8815.</strong>“并且号角的响声甚强大”表周围的一种属天状态。这从“号角的响声或声音”的含义清楚可知，“号角的响声或声音”是指属天良善的真理，“响声”是指真理，“号角”是指属天良善，如前所述（<a href="8802.htm">8802</a>节）。它之所以表示周围的一种属天状态，是因为天堂里的神性在中间或至内在部分，也就是那里的最高部分。但被天使占据的天堂在周围或外面，也就是在下面；因为在周围的也在外面，外面的也在下面。“响声”和“闪电”就表示天堂里的神之真理本身；但“号角的响声”则表示与神性，也就是下面或周围的真理相联结的属天真理或天使真理。在撒迦利亚书也是如此：<br />耶和华必显现在他们以上，祂的箭必射出像闪电。主耶和华必吹角，乘南方的旋风而行。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚9.14.htm">9:14</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />神带着轰鸣声上去，耶和华带着号角的响声上去。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗47.5.htm">47:5</a>）<br />“轰鸣声”表示属灵良善的真理，“号角的响声”表示属天良善的真理。<br />天使所吹的号角（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启8.2.htm">8:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启8.6.htm">6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启8.8.htm">8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启8.12.htm">12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启8.13.htm">13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启9.14.htm">9:14</a>）也表示穿过天堂的神性真理。当耶利哥城陷落的时候，七个祭司在约柜前，或耶和华面前所吹的七个号角（约书亚记6章），以及基甸所带领的三百人在米甸、亚玛力的营和东方人周围所吹的号角（士师记7章）也代表来自天堂的神之真理。号角之所以产生这种效果，是因为它们代表穿过天堂的神之真理。这真理具有这样的性质：它完善善人，却毁灭恶人。它完善善人是因为，善人接受真理里面的神性良善；它毁灭恶人是因为，恶人不接受它里面的神性良善。“耶利哥的城墙”表示扞卫邪恶的虚假，而基甸的三百人在其营周围吹号角的“米甸人、亚玛力人和东方人”则表示那些沉浸于邪恶和由此产生的虚假之人。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8815</b></p><p><b>8815.</b>
And the voice of a trumpet exceeding strong. That this signifies a celestial state which was round about, is evident from the signification of "the voice," or sound, "of a trumpet," as being the truth 
of celestial good, "a voice" denoting truth, and "a trumpet" celestial good (as above, n. 8802). That it denotes a celestial state which was round about, is because the Divine in heaven is in the midst 
or inmost, that is, in the highest there; but relatively to the angels heaven is around or outside of them, that is, is beneath, for that which is around is also outside, and that which is outside 
is also beneath. Truth Divine itself in heaven is signified by "voices" and "lightnings," but the celestial or angelic truth adjoined to what is Divine, which is beneath or around, is signified by "the 
voice of a trumpet," in like manner as in Zechariah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah shall appear over them, and His arrow shall go forth as the lightning; and the Lord Jehovih shall sound with the trumpet, and shall 
advance in whirlwinds of the south (Zech. 9:14). And in David: </p>
<p>     God is gone up with a sounding, Jehovah with the voice of a trumpet (Ps. 47:5); </p>
<p>where "a sounding" denotes the truth of spiritual 
good; "the voice of a trumpet," the truth of celestial good. [2] The Divine truth which passes through heaven is also meant by the trumpets with which the angels sounded (Rev. 8:2, 6-8, 12, 13; 9:14). 
Truth Divine from heaven was also represented by the seven trumpets with which the seven priests sounded before the ark or before Jehovah, when the walls of the city Jericho fell (Josh. 6); also 
by the trumpets with which the three hundred men who were with Gideon sounded round about the camp of Midian, Amalek, and the sons of the east (Judg. 7). The reason why the trumpets produced this effect 
was that they represented the truth Divine through the heavens, which is such that it perfects the good, but destroys the evil; the reason why it perfects the good is that these receive the Divine 
good which is in the truth; but that it destroys the evil is because these do not receive the Divine good which is in it. The "walls of Jericho" signified the falsities which defended evils; and "Midian, 
Amalek, and the sons of the east," round about whose camp the three hundred men of Gideon sounded the trumpets, signified those who were in evils and in the derivative falsities. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8815</b></p><p><b>8815.</b>
'And the voice of a trumpet extremely loud' means a celestial state which was round about. This is clear from the meaning of 'the voice (or sound) of the trumpet' as the truth of celestial good, 'the 
voice' being truth and 'a trumpet' celestial good, as above in <a href="8802.htm">8802</a>. The reason why a celestial state which was round about is meant is that the Divine in heaven is in the middle or inmost part, that 
is, the highest part there But heaven as occupied by angels lies round about or outside, that is, below; for what is round about is also outside, and what is outside is also below. God's truth itself 
in heaven is meant by 'voices and lightnings'; but celestial or angelic truth linked to the Divine, which is the truth below or round about, is meant by 'the voice of a trumpet' Similarly in Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah 
will appear over them, and His arrow will go forth like lightning; and the Lord Jehovih will sound a blast on the trumpet, and move forward in storms of the south. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%209:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 9:14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in 
David, </p>
<blockquote>
God has gone up with a blast, Jehovah with the voice of a trumpet. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2047:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 47:5</a> 
</blockquote>
<p>'A blast' stands for the truth of spiritual good, 'the voice of a trumpet' for the truth of celestial good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
Divine Truth passing through heaven is also meant by the trumpets on which the angels blasted in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%208:2,%206-8,%2012,%2013;%209:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 8:2, 6-8, 12, 13; 9:14</a>. God's truth from heaven was represented too by the seven trumpets on which 
the seven priests blasted before the Ark or in front of Jehovah when the walls of the city of Jericho fell down, Joshua <a href="6.htm">6</a>; and also by the trumpets with which the three hundred men accompanying Gideon 
made a noise around the camp of Midian, Amalek, and the Sons of the East, Judges <a href="7.htm">7</a>. The reason why the trumpets achieved that effect was that they represented God's truth passing through the heavens. 
This truth is such that it perfects the good but destroys the evil. It perfects the good because they receive Divine Good present within Truth, but it destroys the evil because they do not receive 
Divine Good present there. 'The walls of Jericho' meant the falsities that defended evils, and 'Midian, Amalek, and the Sons of the East', around whose camp Gideon's three hundred men blasted on their 
trumpets, meant those immersed in evils and in falsities arising from them </p>

`Et vox buccinae {1}vehemens valde': quod significet statum caelestem qui circum, constat ex significatione `vocis' seu `soni buccinae' quod sit verum boni caelestis; `vox' {2} est verum, et `buccina' 
est bonum caeleste, ut supra n. 8802; quod sit status caelestis qui circum, est quia Divinum in caelo est in medio seu intimo, hoc est, in supremo ibi; at caelum respective ad angelos est circum seu 
extra, hoc est, infra, nam quod circum est etiam est extra, et quod extra est etiam est infra; ipsum verum Divinum in caelo significatur per `voces et fulgura,' verum autem caeleste seu angelicum Divino 
{3}adjunctum, quod infra seu circum est, significatur per `vocem buccinae'; similiter ac apud Sachariam, Jehovah super illis apparebit, et exibit sicut fulgur telum Ipsius; et Dominus Jehovih buccina 
clanget, et procedet in procellis meridiei, ix 14: </p>
<p>et apud Davidem, Ascendit Deus cum clangore, Jehovah cum voce buccinae, Ps (x)xlvii 6 [A.V. 5]; </p>
<p>`clangor' pro vero boni spiritualis, `vox buccinae' 
pro vero boni caelestis. 	[2] Divinum Verum quod per caelum transit etiam intelligitur per tubas quibus angeli clanxerunt, Apoc. viii 2, 6-8, 12, 13, ix 14; repraesentatum etiam est verum Divinum 
e caelo per septem buccinas quibus septem sacerdotes clanxerunt ante arcam seu coram Jehovah, cum muri urbis Jericho caderent, Jos. vi; tum per buccinas quibus insonuerunt trecenti viri, qui cum 
Guideone, circum castra Midianis, Amaleki, et filiorum orientis, Jud. vii; causa {4}quod buccinae {5}illum effectum ederent, fuit, (x)quia repraesentabant verum Divinum per caelos, quod tale est ut perficiat 
bonos at destruat malos; quod perficiat bonos, est quia hi recipiunt Divinum Bonum quod est in Vero, at quod destruat malos, est quia hi non recipiunt Divinum Bonum quod inibi; {6}`muri Jericho' 
significabant falsa quae defendebant mala, ac `Midian, Amalek, et filii orientis, circum quorum castra trecenti viri Guideonis clanxerunt buccinis' significabant illos qui in malis et inde falsis. @1 
gravis AIT$ @2 i enim$ @3 conjunctum$ @4 est quia$ @5 significabant$ @6 inde est quod Divinum Verum omnes qui in coelo sunt perficiat, at omnes qui in inferno sunt, destruat$ </p>
