<p><strong>[NCE]42.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_42/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_21" target=_top>Genesis 1:21</a>. And God created the big sea creatures, and every living, creeping soul that the waters caused to creep out, in all their kinds, and every bird on the wing, of every kind; and God saw that it was good.<br />Fish symbolize facts, as already stated [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_42/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_40" target=_top>40</a>]. In this instance they symbolize facts animated by faith that is received from the Lord, which therefore possess vitality. Big sea creatures symbolize general categories of facts, from which come subcategories. (Not one thing exists anywhere in the world that does not belong to some general category. The category allows the particular item to come into being and continue in existence.){*1} The prophets mention sea monsters or whales a number of times, and when they do, these symbolize general categories of facts. Pharaoh, king of Egypt, representing human wisdom or understanding (that is, factual information in general), is called a large sea creature, as in Ezekiel:<br />Here, now, I am against you, Pharaoh, king of Egypt, you great sea creature, lying in the middle of your rivers, who has said, "The river is mine, and I have made myself." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_42/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_29_3" target=_top>Ezekiel 29:3</a>)<br />[2] Another:<br />Raise a lamentation over Pharaoh, king of Egypt; and you are to tell him, "But you are like a monster in the seas; and you have emerged among your rivers and churned the waters with your feet." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_42/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_32_2" target=_top>Ezekiel 32:2</a>)<br />This image symbolizes those who want to use facts (meaning they want to use their own powers) to initiate themselves into religious mysteries. In Isaiah:<br />On that day Jehovah, with his steely and great and mighty sword, will exact punishment on Leviathan the stretched-out serpent and on Leviathan the coiled serpent; and he will kill the monsters that are in the sea. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_42/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_27_1" target=_top>Isaiah 27:1</a>)<br />Killing the monsters that are in the sea means leaving such people without awareness even of general facts. In Jeremiah:<br />Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, has devoured me, has churned me up; he has rendered me an empty container, like a sea monster he has swallowed me down, filled his belly with the savors of me, hurled me out. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_42/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_51_34" target=_top>Jeremiah 51:34</a>)<br />In other words, "Nebuchadnezzar" has swallowed up all religious knowledge (the "savors") as the sea monster did to Jonah. In Jonah's case the monster stood for people who possess the broad outlines of this knowledge in the form of facts and who wolf them down.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg is alluding to an issue which was much discussed in Scholastic philosophy, and which persisted down to his own day. The genus, or "general category" (in Swedenborg's Latin, commune), forms a kind of backdrop that enables the individual, or a particular item (particulare), to take existence. That is to say, a table cannot exist unless there is some category of tables as a whole that enables it to come into being (McCormick 1940, 51). [RS] </p>

Verse 21. And God created great whales, and every living soul that creepeth, which the waters made to creep forth, after their kinds, and every winged fowl after its kind; and God saw that it was good. 
"Fishes" as before said, signify memory-knowledges, now animated by faith from the Lord, and thus alive. "Whales" signify their general principles, in subordination to which, and from which, are the 
particulars; for there is nothing in the universe that is not under some general principle, as a means that it may exist and subsist. "Whales" or "great fishes" are sometimes mentioned by the Prophets, 
and they there signify the generals of memory-knowledges. Pharaoh the king of Egypt (by whom is represented human wisdom or intelligence, that is, knowledge [scientia] in general), is called a "great 
whale." As in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great whale that lieth in the midst of his rivers, that hath said, My river is mine own, and I have made myself (Ezek. 
29:3). [2] And in another place: </p>
<p>     Take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou art as a whale in the seas, and hast gone forth in thy rivers, and hast troubled the 
waters with thy feet (Ezek. 32:2), by which words are signified those who desire to enter into the mysteries of faith by means of memory-knowledges, and thus from themselves. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     In that 
day Jehovah, with His hard and great and strong sword, shall visit upon leviathan the longish [oblongum] serpent, even leviathan the crooked serpent, and He shall slay the whales that are in the sea 
(Isa. 27:1). By "slaying the whales that are in the sea" is signified that such persons are ignorant of even the general principles of truth. So in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon 
hath devoured me, he hath troubled me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me as a whale, he hath filled his belly with my delicacies, he hath cast me out (Jer. 51:34),denoting that 
he had swallowed the knowledges of faith, here called "delicacies" as the whale did Jonah; a "whale" denoting those who possess the general principles of the knowledges of faith as mere memory-knowledges, 
and act in this manner. </p>

Verse 21 And God created the great sea monsters, and every living creature that creeps, which the waters produced abundantly according to their kinds; and all winged birds according to their kinds; and 
God saw that it was good.  </p>
<p>As has been stated, 'fish' means facts, here facts quickened and brought to life through faith from the Lord. 'Sea monsters' means those facts' general sources, below 
which and from which details derive. Nothing whatever exists in the universe that does not depend on some general source for its commencement and continuance. In the Prophets sea monsters or whales are 
mentioned several times, and in those places they mean those general sources of facts. Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, who represents human wisdom or intelligence - that is, knowledge in general - is called 
'a great sea monster', as in Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great monster lying in the midst of his<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> rivers, who has said, It is my river and I have made myself. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2029:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 29:3</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 And elsewhere in Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
Raise a lamentation over Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and say to him, You are like a monster in the seas, and you have come forth in your rivers, and have 
troubled the waters with your feet. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2032:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 32:2</a> 
</blockquote>
<p>These words mean people who wish to penetrate the mysteries that are part of faith by means of facts, and so from themselves. In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
On that 
day Jehovah will make a visitation with His hard and great and strong sword upon Leviathan the full-length serpent,<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> and upon Leviathan the twisting serpent, and He will slay the monsters that are in 
the sea. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2027:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 27:1</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Slaying the monsters in the sea' means preventing people's knowing facts even in their general aspects. In Jeremiah,   Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel has devoured me, he has 
troubled me, he has made me an empty vessel, he has swallowed me up like a sea monster, he has filled his belly with my delicacies, he has cast me out. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2051:34&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 51:34</a>.  </p>
<p>This stands for the fact that mankind 
did swallow cognitions of faith, which are 'the delicacies' here, just as the sea monster swallowed up Jonah. In that story the sea monster stands for people who treat general cognitions of faith 
as mere facts, and behave accordingly.

Vers. 21.  Et creavit Deus cetos magnos; et omnem animam viventem reptantem, quam prorepere fecerunt aquae, secundum species suas; et omnem avem alae secundum speciem suam; et vidit Deus quod bonum. 
'Pisces,' ut dictum, significant scientifica, hic per fidem a Domino animata et sic viva; 'ceti' significant illorum communia, sub quibus et ex quibus particularia; nihil quicquam in universo datur quod 
non sub aliquo communi est ut existat et subsistat: apud Prophetas aliquoties nominantur ceti aut balaenae et ibi significant communia scientificorum; Pharaoh, rex Aegypti, per quem repraesentatur 
sapientia seu intelligentia humana, hoc est, scientia in genere, vocatur cetus magnus: ut apud Ezechielem, Ecce Ego contra te, Pharaoh rex Aegypti, cete magne, cubans in medio fluviorum {1} tuorum, 
qui dixit, Mihi fluvius, et ego feci me, xxix 3:  et alibi, Tolle lamentationem super Pharaonem, regem Aegypti, et dicas ad eum,...Et tu sicut cetus in maribus, et prodiisti in fluminibus tuis, et conturbasti 
aquas pedibus tuis, xxxii 2;  per quae significantur ii qui per scientifica, ita ex se, intrare volunt in mysteria fidei: apud Esaiam, In die isto visitabit Jehovah gladio suo duro, et magno, 
et forti, super leviathanem serpentem {2} oblongum, et super leviathanem serpentem tortuosum, et occidet  {3} cetos, qui in mari, {x}xxvii I: </p>
<p>per 'occidere cetos in mari' significatur ut ne quidem 
communia sciant: apud Jeremiam, Comedit me, conturbavit Nebuchadnezzar, rex Babelis: constituit me vas inane, deglutivit me, sicut cetus, implevit ventrem suum ex deliciis meis, expulit me, li 34; </p>
<p>pro 
quod cognitiones fidei, quae hic sunt deliciae, ita deglutiverit sicut cetus Jonam, ubi 'cetus' pro iis qui communia cognitionum fidei ut scientifica possident, et sic faciunt. @  1 Heb.=suorum, 
which S. has in 7293 and other places.$ @  2 Sch. has oblongum, but Heb.      (bariah)=fleeing or gliding. Probably the intention is to contrast the moving serpent with the coiled and resting serpent.$ @ 
 3 Sch. has cetos, but Heb. is probably a singular noun.$ </p>
