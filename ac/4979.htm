And it came to pass from the time that he set him over in his house, and over all that he had. That this signifies a second state, after good applied itself thereto, and all that belonged to it was as 
it were in its power, is evident from the signification of the expression "it came to pass," or "it was," so often found in the Word, as involving something new, and consequently another state (as likewise 
in the following verses, 7, 10, 11, 13, 15, 18, 19); and from the signification of "from the time that he set him over in his house," as being after good had applied itself thereto (of which above, 
n. 4977); and from the signification of "over all that he had," as being that all that belonged to it was as it were in its power (of which also above, n. 4978). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4979</b></p><p><b>4979.</b>
'And it happened from the time he put him in charge in his house and over all that he had' means a second state, after this good had applied itself to that truth and had made all that belonged to it 
seemingly subject to the power and control of that truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'it happened' or 'so it was' - an expression used many times in the Word - as that which implies something new 
and therefore a second state (similarly in verses 7, 10, 11, 13, 15, 18, 19 below); from the meaning of 'from the time he put him in charge in his house' as after good had applied itself to that truth, 
dealt with above in <a href="4977.htm">4977</a>; and from the meaning of 'over all that he had' as all that belonged to such good was made seemingly subject to the power and control of that truth, also dealt with above, in <a href="4978.htm">4978</a>. </p>

`Et factum e quo praefecit eum in domo sua, et super omne quod erat illi':  quod significet statum alterum, postquam applicuit se ei bonum, et omne suum sicut in ejus potestate, constat (c)ex significatione 
`factum' seu fuit, quod multoties in Verbo dicitur, quod involvat novum quid, proinde statum alterum, similiter in sequentibus vers. 7, 10, 11, 13, 15, 18, 19; ex significatione `e quo 
praefecit eum in domo sua' quod sit postquam applicuit se ei bonum, de qua supra n. 4977; et ex significatione `super omne quod erat illi' quod sit et omne suum sicut in ejus potestate, de qua etiam 
supra n. 4978. </p>
