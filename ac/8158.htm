<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8158.</strong>出埃及记14:10-14.法老临近的时候，以色列人举目看见埃及人追赶他们，就甚惧怕；以色列人向耶和华哀求。他们对摩西说，难道在埃及没有坟地，你把我们带来死在旷野吗？你为什么这样待我们，将我们从埃及领出来呢？我们在埃及不是对你说过这话，说，不要管我们，容我们服事埃及人吗？因为服事埃及人比死在旷野还好。摩西对百姓说，不要惧怕，只管站住！看耶和华今天向你们所要施行的救恩。因为，你们今天所看见的埃及人，必永远不再看见了。耶和华必为你们争战，你们只管静默。<br />“法老临近的时候”表来自那里的邪恶所生虚假的流注极其严重。“以色列人举目”表心智的理解力部分及其思维。“看见埃及人追赶他们”表虚假的严重性不断增长。“就甚惧怕”表一种可怕的恐惧感。“以色列人向耶和华哀求”表祈求帮助。“他们对摩西说”表试探的顶点，就是绝望之时。“难道在埃及没有坟地，你把我们带来死在旷野吗”表如果诅咒是他们的命运，那么对他们来说，它是通过侵扰者的虚假到来，还是通过他们将在其中屈服的一种试探状态到来，都一样，没什么区别。“你为什么这样待我们，将我们从埃及领出来呢”表他们从虚假的侵扰中被释放也是徒劳的。“我们在埃及不是对你说过这话吗，说”表当被虚假侵扰时，他们想过这样的事。“不要管我们，容我们服事埃及人”表他们不会从投降中被拉回来。“因为服事埃及人比死在旷野还好”表在一种侵扰的状态下通过虚假的暴行到来的诅咒要好于在一种试探的状态下通过屈服到来的诅咒。“摩西对百姓说”表被神之真理从一种绝望的状态中提升。“不要惧怕”表他们不可绝望。“只管站住！看耶和华的救恩”表救恩唯独来自主，根本不来自他们自己。“今天向你们所要施行”表将持续永恒之物。“因为，你们今天所看见的埃及人，必永远不再看见了”表虚假一次被移走，就永远被移走。“耶和华必为你们争战”表唯独主承受试探的争战。“你们只管静默”表凭自己的能力，他们绝对一事无成。</p>

Verses 10-14. And Pharaoh drew nigh, and the sons of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold the Egyptian marching after them, and they were sore afraid; and the sons of Israel cried unto Jehovah. And 
they said unto Moses, Were there no graves in Egypt, that thou hast taken us to die in the wilderness? Why hast thou done this to us, to lead us forth out of Egypt? Is not this the word that we spake 
unto thee in Egypt, saying, Cease from us, and let us serve the Egyptians? because it is good for us to serve the Egyptians, rather than that we should die in the wilderness. And Moses said unto the 
people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of Jehovah, which He will do for you today; for the Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye shall see them again no more forever. Jehovah shall wage 
war for you, and ye shall keep silence.  "And Pharaoh drew nigh," signifies the influx of falsity from evil being thence grievous; "and the sons of Israel lifted up their eyes," signifies the mind's 
intellectual part and its thought; "and behold the Egyptian marching after them," signifies the grievousness of falsity continually increasing; "and they were sore afraid," signifies a horrible dread; 
"and the sons of Israel cried unto Jehovah," signifies supplication for aid; "and they said unto Moses," signifies the height of temptation when there is despair; "Were there no graves in Egypt, 
that thou hast taken us to die in the wilderness?" signifies that if there is damnation it would be all the same whether it came through the falsities of the infested, or through a state of temptations 
in which they would yield; "why hast thou done this to us, to lead us forth out of Egypt?" signifies that it was in vain that they had been liberated from infestations by falsities; "is not this the 
word that we spake unto thee in Egypt, saying," signifies that some such thing was thought of when they were infested by falsities; "Cease from us, and let us serve the Egyptians," signifies that they 
would not be withheld from surrendering; "because it is good for us to serve the Egyptians, rather than that we should die in the wilderness," signifies that damnation by the violence of falsity in 
a state of infestations was to be preferred to the damnation which comes by yielding in a state of temptations; "and Moses said unto the people," signifies elevation from a state of despair by means of 
truth Divine; "Fear ye not," signifies that they must not despair; "stand still and see the salvation of Jehovah," signifies salvation from the Lord alone and not at all from them; "which He will do 
for you today," signifies which is to eternity; "for the Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye shall see them again no more forever," signifies that the falsities which are once removed will be removed 
to eternity; "Jehovah shall wage war for you," signifies that the Lord alone sustains the combats of temptations "and ye shall keep silence," signifies that from their own strength they will effect 
nothing at all. </p>

Verses 10-14 And Pharaoh drew near. And the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians were travelling after them; and they were in great fear, and the children of Israel cried 
out to Jehovah. And they said to Moses, Were there no graves in Egypt, [since] you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? What is this you have done to us, to bring us out of Egypt? Is this not 
the word that we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, Leave us alone, and let us serve the Egyptians; for it is better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness? And Moses said to the people, 
Have no fear; stand firm and see the salvation of Jehovah, which He will accomplish for you today; for the Egyptians whom you see today you will see again no more for ever. Jehovah will fight for 
you, and you are to be silent. </p>
<p>And Pharaoh drew near' means an oppressive influx from there of falsity arising from evil. 'And the children of Israel lifted up their eyes' means the understanding 
part of the mind, and thought. 'And behold, the Egyptians were travelling after them' means the constantly increasing oppressiveness of falsity. 'And they were in great fear' means a feeling of horror. 
'And the children of Israel cried out to Jehovah' means pleading for help. 'And they said to Moses' means the climax of the temptation, when there is despair. 'Were there no graves in Egypt, [since] 
you have taken us away to die in the wilderness?' means that if damnation was their lot it made no difference whether it came to them through the falsities of molesters or through a state of temptations 
in which they would go under. 'What is this you have done to us, to bring us out of Egypt?' means that their deliverance from molestations by falsities had been to no avail. 'Is this not the word 
that we spoke to you in Egypt, saying' means that something such as this had been thought by them when they were molested by falsities. 'Leave us alone, and let us serve the Egyptians' means that they 
would not be drawn back from surrendering themselves. 'For it is better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness?' means that damnation through the violence of falsity in the state 
of molestations would be preferable to damnation that came about through yielding in a state of temptations. 'And Moses said to the people' means being raised by God's truth from a state of despair. 
'Have no fear' means that there should be no feeling of despair. 'Stand firm and see the salvation of Jehovah' means salvation from the Lord alone and not at all from themselves. 'Which He will accomplish 
today' means which will continue into eternity. 'For the Egyptians whom you see today you will see again no more for ever' means that falsities which are moved aside once will remain moved aside 
even into eternity. 'Jehovah will fight for you' means that the Lord alone endures the conflicts brought by temptations. 'And you are to be silent' means that by their own powers they will achieve absolutely nothing. </p>

Vers. 10-14.  Et Pharao appropinquavit; et sustulerunt filii Israelis oculos suos, et ecce Aegyptius proficiscens post illos; et timuerunt valde, et clamaverunt filii Israelis ad Jehovam.  Et dixerunt 
ad Moschen, Numne nulla sepulcra in Aegypto, sumpsisti nos ad moriendum in deserto? quid hoc fecisti nobis, ad educendum nos ex Aegypto? Nonne hoc verbum quod locuti sumus ad te in Aegypto, dicendo, 
Cessa a nobis, et serviamus Aegyptiis, quia bonum nobis servire Aegyptiis prae mori nos in deserto?  Et dixit Moscheh ad populum, Ne timeatis, consistite, et videte salutem Jehovae quam faciet vobis 
hodie; quia quos videtis Aegyptios hodie, non addetis videre illos amplius usque in saeculum.  Jehovah militabit pro vobis, et vos taceatis.  `Et Pharao appropinquavit' significat influxum falsi ex malo 
gravem inde: `et sustulerunt filii Israelis oculos suos' significat intellectuale mentis (c)et cogitationem: `et ecce Aegyptius proficiscens post illos' significat ingravescentiam falsi continue crescentem: 
`et timuerunt valde' significat horrescentiam: `et clamaverunt filii Israelis ad Jehovam' significat supplicationem de ope: `et dixerunt ad Moschen' significat tentationis summum {1}cum desperatio: 
`Numne nulla sepulcra in Aegypto, sumpsisti nos ad moriendum in deserto?' significat si damnatio quod aeque fuerit si illa per falsa infestantium, vel si per statum tentationum in quo succumberent: 
`quid hoc fecisti nobis, ad educendum nos ex Aegypto?' significat quod irritum esset quod ex infestationibus a falsis liberati sint: `Nonne hoc verbum quod locuti sumus ad te in Aegypto, dicendo' 
significat quod tale quid cogitatum cum infestati a falsis: `Cessa a nobis, et serviamus Aegyptiis' significat quod non retraherentur quin se dedant: `quia bonum nobis servire Aegyptiis prae mori in 
deserto?' significat quod damnatio per falsi violentiam in statu infestationum praestaret (x)damnationi quae per succumbentiam in statu tentationum: `et dixit Moscheh ad populum' significat elevationem 
e statu desperationis per verum Divinum: `Ne timeatis' significat quod non desperandum: `consistite, et videte salutem Jehovae' significat salvationem a Domino solo, ac nihil ab illis: `quam faciet 
hodie' significat quae in aeternum: `quia quos videtis Aegyptios hodie, non addetis videre illos amplius usque in saeculum' significat quod falsa quae semel amoventur erunt in aeternum amota: `Jehovah 
militabit pro vobis' significat quod Dominus solus tentationum pugnas sustineat: `et vos taceatis' significat quod ex suis viribus prorsus nihil efficient. 	@1 cp n. 8164$ </p>
