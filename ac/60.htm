<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第60节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>60.</strong>创世记1:31 神看着一切所造的都甚好。有晚上，有早晨，是第六日。<br />当前的状态被称作“甚好”，而此前只是被称作“好”。这是因为，到了当前，信与爱结合为一，属灵的与属天的结合为一。</p>

And God saw all that he had done and, yes, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.<br />This time it says very good but previously it said simply good, because now the components of faith combine with those of love to make one entity. A marriage between spiritual and heavenly things has taken place. </p>

Verse 31. And God saw everything that He had made, and behold it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. This state is called "very good" the former ones being merely called 
"good;" because now the things which are of faith make a one with those which are of love, and thus a marriage is effected between spiritual things and celestial things. </p>

Verse 31 And God saw everything that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning, a sixth day.  This verse says 'very good', whereas previous verses merely 
said 'good', for now the things of faith make one with those of love. A marriage has accordingly taken place between spiritual and celestial things.

Vers. 31.  Et vidit Deus omne quod fecit, et ecce bonum valde. Et fuit vespera, et fuit mane, dies sextus. Hic 'bonum valde' dicitur, in prioribus modo 'bonum'; quia nunc illa quae sunt fidei, unum 
faciunt cum illis quae sunt amoris; sic conjugium factum inter spiritualia et caelestia. </p>
