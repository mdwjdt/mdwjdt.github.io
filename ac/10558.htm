<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10558</strong>.出埃及记33:12-17.摩西对耶和华说，看哪，你对我说，将这百姓领上去；却没有叫我知道你要打发谁与我同去。你曾说过，我按名认识你，你也在我眼中蒙恩。我如今若在你眼中蒙恩，求你将你的道让我知道，求你使我可以认识你，因为我已经在你眼中蒙恩。求你想到这民族是你的人民。祂说，我的脸必和你同去，使你得安息。摩西对祂说，你的脸若不走在我前面，就不要把我们从这里领上去。要在什么事上得以知道我和你的百姓在你眼中蒙恩呢？岂不是因你与我们同去，所以我和你的百姓才比地面上的所有人民都要尊贵？耶和华对摩西说，你所说的这件事我也要行，因为你已在我眼中蒙恩，并且我按名认识你。<br />“摩西对耶和华说”表对神性，因而教会本身不与他们同住的恼怒。“看哪，你对我说，将这百姓领上去”表对教会要与这个民族同住的庄严承诺。“却没有叫我知道你要打发谁与我同去”表没有神性的指引，这事无法成就。“你曾说过，我按名认识你”表他的品质。“你也在我眼中蒙恩”表他被接纳，因为他有能力领导这个民族。“我如今若在你眼中蒙恩”表如果他因此被接纳。“求你将你的道让我知道，求你使我可以认识你”表关于将要与他们同住的神性是何性质的指示。“因为我已经在你眼中蒙恩”表因为他被接纳，有权掌管这个人民。“求你想到这民族是你的人民”表他们是这个世界上唯一与掌管万有的神性同住的人。“祂说，我的脸必和你同去，使你得安息”表构成教会、敬拜和圣言的神性元素将存在于那里，即便与这个民族本身同住的外在之物将缺乏这种元素。“摩西对祂说，你的脸若不走在我前面，就不要把我们从这里领上去”表如果神性不存在于那里，那里将不会有构成教会的任何东西。“要在什么事上得以知道我和你的百姓在你眼中蒙恩呢？岂不是因你与我们同去”表如果神性在他们当中显现，优先于其他人的接纳。“所以我和你的百姓才比地面上的所有人民都要尊贵”表由此而来的在教会所在的地方超越全世界所有人的显赫。“耶和华对摩西说，你所说的这件事我也要行”表神性要存在于与他们同在的教会、敬拜和圣言的外在里面。“因为你已在我眼中蒙恩，并且我按名认识你”表他因其品质而被接纳。</p>

Verses 12-17. And Moses said unto Jehovah, See, Thou sayest unto me, Make this people come up; and Thou hast not made known to me whom Thou wilt send with me. And Thou hast said, I know thee by name, 
and thou hast also found grace in Mine eyes. And now I pray, If I have found grace in Thine eyes, make known to me, I pray, Thy way, that I may know Thee, because I have found grace in Thine eyes; and 
see that this nation is Thy people. And He said, My faces shall go, and I will make thee to rest. And he said unto Him, If Thy faces go not, do not make us to go up from hence. And wherein shall it 
ever become known that I have found grace in Thine eyes, I and Thy people? Is it not in Thy going with us? and we shall be rendered preeminent, and Thy people, above all the people that are upon the faces 
of the ground. And Jehovah said unto Moses, I will do this word also that thou hast spoken; because thou hast found grace in Mine eyes, and know thee by name. "And Moses said unto Jehovah" signifies 
indignation that the Divine, thus the church itself, was not with them; "See, Thou sayest unto me, Make this people come up" signifies a solemn promise that the church should be with that nation; 
"and Thou hast not made known to me whom Thou wilt send with me" signifies that this cannot be done without the Divine auspices; "and Thou hast said, I know thee by name" signifies his quality; "and Thou 
hast also found grace in Mine eyes" signifies that he was accepted because he could preside over that nation; "and now I pray if I have found grace in Thine eyes" signifies if he was accepted on this 
account; "make known to me I pray Thy way, that I may know Thee" signifies instruction concerning what would be the nature of the Divine with them; "because I have found grace in Thine eyes" signifies 
because he was received to preside over the people; "and see that this nation is Thy people" signifies that they are the only ones in the world with whom is the Divine which is over all things; "and 
He said, My faces shall go, and I will make thee to rest" signifies that the Divine of the church, of worship, and of the Word shall be there, but with the nation itself what is external without it; 
"and he said unto Him, If Thy faces go not, do not make us go up from hence" signifies if the Divine be not there, there will not be anything of the church; "and wherein shall it ever become known 
that I have found grace in Thine eyes, I and Thy people? Is it not in Thy going with us?" signifies reception above others if the Divine be manifested among them; "and we shall be rendered preeminent, 
I and Thy people, above all the people that are upon the faces of the ground" signifies their consequent preeminence to all in the whole world where the church is; "and Jehovah said unto Moses, I will 
do this word also that thou hast spoken" signifies that the Divine shall be in the external of the church, of worship, and of the Word, which is with them; "because thou hast found grace in Mine eyes, 
and I know thee by name" signifies that he is accepted on account of his quality. </p>

Verses 12-17  And Moses said to Jehovah, See, You say to me, Cause this people to go up; and You have not made known to me whom You will send with me. And You have said, I know you by name, and also 
you have found grace in My eyes. And now if, I beg You, I have found grace in Your eyes, make Your way known to me, I beg You, and I shall know You, because I have found grace in Your eyes. And consider<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> 
that this nation is Your people. And He said, My face<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> will go [with you], and I will cause you to rest. And he said to Him, If Your face<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> is not going [before me], do not cause us to go up from 
here. And how will it ever be made known that I have found grace in Your eyes, I and Your people? Will it not be in Your going with us? And I and Your people will be made more distinguished than all 
the people who are on the face of the ground. And Jehovah said to Moses, I will also do this thing that you have spoken, since you have found grace in My eyes and I know you by name. </p>
<p>'[And] Moses said 
to Jehovah' means annoyance that the Divine, and so the Church itself, does not reside with them. 'See, You say to me, Cause this people to go up' means the solemn promise of a Church among that nation. 
'And You have not made known to me whom You will send with me' means that without Divine direction that thing cannot be accomplished. 'And You have said, I know you by name' means his character. 
'And also you have found grace in My eyes' means that he was accepted because he had the ability to head that nation. 'And now if, I beg You, I have found grace in Your eyes' means if he were accepted 
because of that. 'Make Your way known to me, I beg You, and I shall know You' means instruction regarding the Divine, what He will be like as He resides with them. 'Because I have found grace in Your 
eyes' means because he has been accepted to be in authority over the people. 'And consider that this nation is Your people' means that they alone in the world are the ones with whom the Divine, the 
ruler over all things, resides. 'And He said, My face will go [with you], and I will cause you to rest' means that the Divine element composing the Church, worship, and the Word will be present, even 
though what is external with the actual nation will be devoid of that element. 'And he said to Him, If Your face is not going [before me], do not cause us to go up from here' means that if the Divine 
is not present there, nothing constituting the Church will be there. 'And how will it ever be made known that I have found grace in Your eyes, I and Your people? Will it not be in Your going with us?' 
means acceptance in preference to others if the Divine shows Himself among them. 'And I and Your people will be made more distinguished than all the people who are on the face of the ground' means the 
consequent pre-eminence over all throughout the whole world [where the Church exists]. 'And Jehovah said to Moses, I will also do this thing that you have spoken' means that the Divine will be present 
within that external aspect of the Church, worship, and the Word which exists with them. 'Since you have found grace in My eyes and I know you by name' means that he has been accepted on account of 
his character.

Vers. 12-17.  Et dixit Moscheh ad Jehovam, Vide, Tu dicis ad me, Ascendere fac populum hunc, et Tu non notum fecisti mihi quem missurus es cum me, et Tu dixisti, Novi te nomine, et quoque invenisti 
gratiam in oculis Meis.  Et nunc si quaeso inveni gratiam in oculis Tuis, (x)notam fac mihi quaeso viam Tuam, et cognoscam Te, quoniam inveni gratiam in oculis Tuis, et vide quod populus Tuus gens haec. 
 Et dixit, Facies (x)Meae ibunt, et quiescere faciam te.  Et dixit ad Ipsum, Si non facies Tuae euntes, ne ascendere facias nos abhinc.  Et in quo notum fiet usquam quod invenerim gratiam in oculis 
Tuis, ego et populus Tuus, nonne in eundo Te cum nobis? et praestantes reddemur ego et populus Tuus prae omni populo qui super faciebus humi.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Etiam verbum hoc quod locutus 
es faciam, quia invenisti gratiam in oculis Meis, et cognosco te nomine.  `[Et] dixit Moscheh ad Jehovam' significat indignationem quod non Divinum, ita non ipsa Ecclesia apud illos:  `Vide, Tu dicis 
ad me, Ascendere fac populum hunc' significat sponsionem Ecclesiae apud illam gentem:  `et Tu non notum fecisti mihi quem missurus es cum me' significat quod id absque auspicio Divino non fieri possit: 
 `et Tu dixisti, Novi te nomine' significat quale ejus:  `et quoque invenisti gratiam in oculis Meis' significat quod {1}receptus quia genti isti praeesse potuit:  `et nunc {2}si quaeso inveni gratiam 
in oculis Tuis' significat si acceptus ideo:  `notam fac mihi quaeso viam Tuam, et cognoscam Te' significat instructionem de Divino quale erit cum illis: `quoniam inveni gratiam in oculis Tuis' 
significat quia receptus praeesse populo:  `et vide quod populus Tuus gens haec' significat quod soli in mundo apud quos Divinum quod super omnia:  `et dixit, Facies Meae ibunt, et quiescere faciam te' 
significat quod Divinum Ecclesiae, cultus, et Verbi erit ibi, sed apud ipsam gentem externum absque illo: `et dixit ad Ipsum, Si non facies Tuae euntes, ne ascendere facias nos abhinc' significat si 
non Divinum sit ibi, non aliquid Ecclesiae erit:  `et in quo notum fiet usquam quod invenerim gratiam in oculis Tuis, ego et populus Tuus, nonne in eundo Te cum nobis?' significat receptionem prae aliis 
si Divinum manifestetur apud illos:  `et praestantiores reddemur ego et populus Tuus prae omni populo qui super faciebus humi' significat inde eminentiam super omnes in universo orbe [ubi Ecclesia]: 
 `et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Etiam verbum hoc quod locutus es faciam' significat quod Divinum erit in externo Ecclesiae, cultus, et Verbi, quod apud eos:  `quia invenisti gratiam in oculis Meis, 
et cognosco te nomine' significat quod {1}receptus sit propter quale ejus. @1 acceptus IT cp n. 10563, 10572$ @2 quaeso si IT$ </p>
