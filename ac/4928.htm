<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4928节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4928.</strong>“后来，他兄弟也生出来”表实际上良善是在先的。这从“谢拉”的代表清楚可知，此处“兄弟”所指的“谢拉”是指良善。因为他就是那打开子宫的，因而是头生的，染过两次的线就是拴在他手上，他就表示这种良善，如前所示（<a href="4925.htm">4925</a>节）。“后来，他的兄弟也生出来”之所以表示实际上良善是在先的，是因为在人重生期间，良善是看不见的，它将自己隐藏在内层人里面，仅照着真理与它结合的程度通过情感流入真理。但当真理与良善结合时，如当人实现重生时，良善就会显现；因为这时，人出于良善行事；良善可以说是他看待真理的立场，因为这时，他更关注生活，而非教义。</p>

And afterward came out his brother. That this signifies good actually prior, is evident from the representation of Zerah, who here is the "brother," as being good; for he it was who opened the womb, 
thus who was the firstborn, and upon whose hand was the double-dyed, which, as shown above (n. 4925), is good. That by his brother's coming out afterward is signified that good is actually prior, is because 
during man's regeneration good does not appear, because it conceals itself in the interior man, and only flows into truth through affection according to the degrees of conjunction of truth with 
it. But when truth has been conjoined with good, as when man has been regenerated, good manifests itself; for man then acts from good and regards truths as from good, because he is then more studious 
of life than of doctrine. </p>

'And afterwards his brother came out' means good which in actual fact is prior. This is clear from the representation of Zerah, to whom 'brother' refers here, as good. For he was the one who opened the 
womb, and so who was the firstborn, and on whose hand was the twice-dyed thread - such good being meant by him, see <a href="4925.htm">4925</a>. The reason 'afterwards his brother came out' means that good in actual fact 
is prior is that while a person is being regenerated good is not seen because it conceals itself within the interior man and flows into truth solely through affection in whatever degrees that truth is 
joined to it. When therefore truth has been joined to good, which is effected once the person has been regenerated, good reveals itself; for at this point good motivates his actions and good is so to 
speak the standpoint from which he sees truths since he is more concerned with life than with doctrine. </p>

</p><b>4928.</b>
`Et postea exivit frater ejus':  quod significet bonum actualiter prius, constat ex repraesentatione `Zerahi' qui hic frater quod sit bonum; is enim fuit qui aperuit uterum, ita qui primogenitus 
fuit, et cujus super manu dibaphum; quod id bonum sit, videatur {1} n. 4925: quod per `postea exivit frater ejus' significetur quod bonum actualiter prius, est quia bonum cum regeneratur homo, non 
appareat, quia se occultat in interiore homine, ac modo influit in verum per affectionem secundum gradus conjunctionis veri secum, cum itaque verum conjunctum est bono, quod fit cum homo regeneratus 
est, tunc bonum se manifestat, nam homo tunc ex bono agit et spectat vera sicut a bono, plus enim tunc studet vitae quam doctrinae. @1 i supra$ </p>
