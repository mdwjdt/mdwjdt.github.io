<p><strong>[NCE]280.</strong> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_280/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_1-24" target=_top>Genesis 3</a> continued]<br />20. And the human called the name of his wife Eve, because "She will be the mother of every living thing."{*1} 21. And Jehovah God made leather tunics for the human and his wife and clothed them.<br />22. And Jehovah God said, "Here, the human has been like one of us, knowing good and evil; and now perhaps people will put out their hand and take from the tree of lives as well, and eat, and live forever."<br />23. And Jehovah God sent them away from the Garden of Eden to cultivate the ground from which they were taken.<br />24. And he threw the humans out. And he caused guardian beings{*2} to live on the east of the Garden of Eden, and the flame of a sword turning itself, to guard the way to the tree of lives.<br />280. Summary<br />THIS passage as a whole deals with the very earliest church and those in it who fell away. As a result it also deals with that church's descendants through to the time of the Flood, when it passed away. [They were as follows:]<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} (in the text of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_280/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_20" target=_top>Genesis 3:20</a>). This verse is a play on the similarity of the Hebrew name חַוָּה (Ḥavvā), usually translated "Eve," and the Hebrew verb for "live," חָיָה (ḥāyā). [LHC]<br />{*2} (in the text of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_280/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_24" target=_top>Genesis 3:24</a>). The Hebrew for "guardian beings" is כְּרֻבִים (kǝruḇîm), often translated "cherubim," a plural form. The traditional translation for the singular, "cherub," has — unfortunately for the purposes of translation — come to be associated with the "cupid," or diminutive winged angel figure (for which the correct technical term is the Italian putto). Originally the cherub seems to have been regarded as "the living chariot of the theophanic God" (Brown, Driver, and Briggs 1996, under כְּרוּב, quoting <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_280/bible_king-james-version_2-samuel_22_11" target=_top>2 Samuel 22:11</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_280/bible_king-james-version_psalms_18_10" target=_top>Psalms 18:10</a>: "he rode upon a cherub"). The celebrated vision in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_280/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_1_1-28" target=_top>Ezekiel 1</a> describes the cherubim as having the faces of a man, ox, lion, and eagle (later equated with the four evangelists in Christian iconography). For Swedenborg, the cherub signifies above all a "guardian being," placed to keep humans who were oriented toward sensory experience from entering realms of sacred experience, which would be harmful for them; see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_280/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_306" target=_top>306</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_280/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_308" target=_top>308</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_280/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2761#subsection-2-4" target=_top>2761:4</a>.
