<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1307节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1307.</strong>“塔顶通天”表甚至到了他们统治天堂事物的地步。这从前面所述可推知。“塔顶通天”就是高抬自己，甚至升到天上，这从圣言中其它地方对于巴别的描述，以及前面有关“高举过头”的论述（<a href="257.htm">257</a>节）明显可知。我欲与天堂生活最为格格不入。事实上，它是一切罪恶的根源，不仅仇恨、还有报复、残忍、奸淫等皆出自它。我欲若渗入敬拜并亵渎之，更与天堂生活对立。因此，地狱就由这类人组成，他们越想昂头升到天上，就越将自己推入更深的地狱，给自己招致的惩罚越可怕。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1307.</strong> The fact that with its head in the sky means with the eventual purpose of controlling what goes on in heaven now follows from the above. Having its head in the sky is having the arrogance to reach all the way to heaven, as descriptions of Babel [Babylon] throughout the Word also demonstrate,{*1} and as earlier remarks in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1307/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_257" target=_top>257</a> about lifting one's head indicate.<br />Self-love is the least harmonious with heavenly life of all possible loves. It is the source of all evil — not only of hatred but of vengefulness, cruelty, and adultery as well. It is even more discordant when it enters into worship and profanes it. Hell consequently consists of people who love themselves, and the higher they wish to raise their heads into heaven, the lower they actually go and the fiercer are the punishments into which they plunge themselves.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For Scripture quotations about Babylon, interpreted by Swedenborg as referring to human arrogance, see the passages quoted below in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1307/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1326" target=_top>1326</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1307/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1327#subsection-2-5" target=_top>1327:5-8</a>.

And its head in heaven. That this signifies even to their having dominion over the things that are in heaven, follows from what has been said. For "to have the head in heaven" is to exalt self even that 
far, as is evident from the description of Babel in other places in the Word; and from what has already been said about "lifting up the head" (n. 257). The love of self is that which is least of all 
in accord with the heavenly life; for all evils come from it, not only hatreds, but also revenges, cruelties, and adulteries; and still less does it accord when it enters into worship, and profanes 
it. And therefore the hells consist of such persons, who the more they would lift up their heads into heaven, the deeper they press themselves down, and the more frightful are the penalties into which 
they precipitate themselves. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1307</b></p><p><b>1307.</b>
'And its head in heaven' means to the extent of their ruling over things in heaven. This follows from what is said above, for 'haying one's head in heaven' is being exalted even as far as that, as is 
also clear from the description of Babel in other parts of the Word and from what has been stated already in <a href="257.htm">257</a> about 'lifting up the head'. Self-love is the love which agrees least of all with heavenly 
life. Indeed it is the source of every form of evil, not only of hatred but also of revenge, cruelty, and adultery. It agrees still less when it enters into worship and profanes it. The hells therefore 
consist of such persons who, the more they wish to rear their heads up into heaven, the more deeply they force themselves down into hell and the harsher the punishments they plunge themselves into. </p>

</p><b>1307.</b>
'Et caput ejus in caelo': quod significet usque ut dominentur super ea quae in caelo, inde nunc sequitur; 'caput enim habere in caelo' est elationem eo usque extendere, ut quoque constat ex descriptione 
Babelis passim in Verbo, et ex illis quae prius dicta sunt de 'extollere caput' n. 257.  Amor sui est qui omnium minime concordat cum vita caelesti; omnia enim inde mala, non solum odia, sed etiam 
vindictae, crudelitates, et adulteria; et adhuc minus concordat cum intrat in cultum et illum profanat, quare inferna consistunt ex talibus ex quibus quo plus caput in caelum attollere volunt, eo profundius 
se deprimunt, seque in atrociores poenas praecipitant. </p>
