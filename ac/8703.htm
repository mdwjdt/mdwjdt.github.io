<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8703节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8703.</strong>“我为你出个主意，愿神与你同在”表它来自神性。这从“出个主意”和“愿神与你同在”的含义清楚可知：当由“叶忒罗”所代表的神性良善来“出个主意”时，“出个主意”是指神性所决定的事，因而是指来自神性的东西；“愿神与你同在”也指来自神性。但“出个主意”所表示的来自神性与“叶忒罗”所代表的神性良善有关；而“愿神与你同在”所表示的来自神性则与“摩西”所代表的神性真理有关。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8703</b></p><p><b>8703.</b>
I will counsel thee, and God shall be with thee. That this signifies that it is from the Divine, is evident from the signification of "to counsel," when by the Divine good which is represented by Jethro, 
as being what is determined by the Divine, thus what is from the Divine; and from the signification of "God shall be with thee," as also being from the Divine. But from the Divine, as signified by 
"to counsel," respects the Divine good which is represented by Jethro; whereas from the Divine, as signified by "God shall be with thee," respects the Divine truth which is represented by Moses. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8703</b></p><p><b>8703.</b>
'I will counsel you, and God will be with you' means that it comes from the Divine. This is clear from the meaning of 'counselling' - when done by Divine Good, represented by 'Jethro' - as what is determined 
by the Divine, and so as what comes from the Divine; and from the meaning of 'God will be with you' also as what comes from the Divine. But from the Divine meant by 'counselling' has regard to 
Divine Good, which is represented by 'Jethro', whereas from the Divine meant by 'God will be with you' has regard to Divine Truth, which is represented by 'Moses'. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 8703</b>
</p><b>8703.</b>
`Consulam tibi, et erit Deus tecum': quod significet quod ex Divino, constat ex significatione (x)`consulere' cum a Divino Bono, quod repraesentatur per `Jethronem,' quod sit decisum a Divino, ita ex 
Divino, et (c)a significatione `erit Deus tecum' quod etiam sit ex Divino; sed ex Divino quod per `consulere' significatur, spectat Divinum Bonum, quod repraesentatur per `Jethronem,' ex Divino autem 
quod per `erit Deus tecum' significatur, spectat Divinum Verum, quod repraesentatur per `Moschen.' </p>
