<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3294节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3294.</strong>“两民要从你腹中分立”表由此产生的真理。这从“民”和“从腹中分立”的含义清楚可知：“民”是指真理（参看<a href="1259.htm">1259</a>，<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>节）；“从腹中分立”是指从那里产生。 在圣言中，当论述出生时，若涉及母亲，经上就用“从子宫或肚腹（womb or belly）出来”这样的表述。因为子宫和两腰论及爱的事物，也就是良善的事物；而当经上用“从腹（bowels）中分立”这样的表述。因为子宫和两腰论及爱的事物，也就是良善的事物；当经上用“从腹中分立”这样的表述时，所表示的是真理的起源。故在此，也就是论述良善的地方，经上说“两族在你肚里”；而当论述真理时，经上则说“两民从你腹中分立”，由此在内义上表示真理源于良善。经上之所以用“两民”这个词，是因为正如良善有内部的和外部的（<a href="3293.htm">3293</a>节），真理也有内部的和外部的。属世人中的内部真理就是那与属世人的内部良善相联结的；而外部真理则是那与属世人的外部良善相联结的。内部真理被称为属世真理，而外部真理被称为感官真理。蒙主怜悯，从下文，也就是论述雅各的地方明显可知真理的这些类型是何情形，因为雅各就代表真理的这两种类型。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3294</b></p><p><b>3294.</b>
And two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels. That this signifies that truth is thence derived, is evident from the signification of "people," as being truth (see n. 1259, 1260); and from the signification 
of being "separated from the bowels," as being to originate thence. In the Word, where birth is treated of, when it is from the mother it is expressed as "coming forth from the womb" or "belly;" 
but when from the father, as being "separated from the bowels." For the womb and the loins are predicated of the things of love, that is, of good; but when the expression "separated from the bowels" 
is used, the origin of truth is signified; therefore here, when good is treated of, it is said that "two nations are from thy womb;" and when truth is treated of, that "two peoples shall be separated 
from thy bowels," whereby is signified, in the internal sense, the origin of truth from good.  "Two peoples" are spoken of, because as good is interior and exterior (n. 3293), so also is truth. 
Interior truth in the natural is that which is conjoined with the interior good of the natural; but exterior truth is that which is conjoined with the exterior good of the natural; the interior truth 
is called natural truth, but the exterior truth is called sensuous. But how the case is with these kinds of truths, will of the Lord's Divine mercy appear from what follows, where Jacob is treated of; 
for by Jacob is represented this truth as to both kinds. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3294</b></p><p><b>3294.</b>
'And two peoples will be separated from your bowels' means resulting truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'people' as truth, dealt with in <a href="1259.htm">1259</a>, <a href="1260.htm">1260</a>, and from the meaning of 'being separated from 
the bowers' as arising from there. When in the Word birth is the subject the expression 'going out of the womb or belly' is used in reference to the mother, but 'being separated from the bowels' in 
reference to the father. For womb and loins are used in reference to the things of love, that is, of good, but when the expression 'being separated from the bowels' is used the origin of truth is meant. 
Here therefore, where the subject is good, the words 'two nations from your womb' are used, and when truth is the subject, 'two peoples will be separated from your bowels'; and by these words the origin 
of truth from good is meant in the internal sense. The expression 'two peoples' is used because just as good is interior and exterior, <a href="3293.htm">3293</a>, so also is truth. Interior truth within the natural is 
that which is joined to the interior good of the natural, while exterior truth is that which is joined to the exterior good of the natural. Interior truth is called natural truth, whereas exterior truth 
is called sensory truth. What exactly these types of truth are, however, will in the Lord's Divine mercy be clear later on where Jacob is the subject, for Jacob represents both of these types of truth. </p>

`Et duo populi e visceribus tuis separabuntur': quod significet quod inde verum, constat ex significatione `populi' quod sit verum, de qua n. 1259, 1260; et ex significatione `separari e visceribus' 
quod sit oriri inde: in Verbo ubi agitur de nativitate, {1}cum a matre, dicitur `exire ex utero seu ventre' et cum ex patre, dicitur {2}separari e visceribus; {3}nam uterus et lumbi praedicantur de illis 
quae sunt amoris, hoc est, boni, cum autem dicitur {2}separari ex visceribus, significatur ortus veri; ideo hic cum agitur de bono, dicitur quod `duae gentes ex utero tuo,' et cum de vero, dicitur, 
`duo populi e visceribus tuis separabuntur,' et per haec significantur in sensu interno ortus veri ex bono: `duo populi' dicuntur quia sicut bonum est interius et exterius, n. (x)3293, ita etiam est 
verum; verum interius in naturali est id quod conjungitur bono interiori naturalis, at verum exterius est id quod conjungitur bono exteriori naturalis; interius verum vocatur naturale verum, at exterius 
vocatur sensuale: quomodo autem cum his veris se habet, {4}ex sequentibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, constabit, ubi agitur de Jacobo, nam per `Jacobum' utrumque illud verum repraesentatur. @1
