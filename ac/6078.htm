<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6078节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6078.</strong>“你仆人的羊群没有草场”表含有真理之良善的记忆知识是缺乏的。这从“羊群草场”的含义清楚可知，“羊群草场”是指含有真理之良善的记忆知识；因此，“没有草场”是指没有任何真理之良善的记忆知识。“草场”在内义上是指维持属灵生命的东西，尤指包含在记忆知识中的真理，因为人的灵魂渴望这种真理，犹如身体渴望食物。这真理提供营养，所以“吃草”表示接受教导（参看<a href="5201.htm">5201</a>节）。记忆知识和真理维持人的灵魂，这一点从人对知识的渴望，以及食物与记忆知识的对应关系（<a href="1480.htm">1480</a>，<a href="3114.htm">3114</a>，<a href="4792.htm">4792</a>，<a href="5147.htm">5147</a>，<a href="5293.htm">5293</a>，<a href="5340.htm">5340</a>，<a href="5342.htm">5342</a>，<a href="5576.htm">5576</a>，<a href="5579.htm">5579</a>，<a href="5915.htm">5915</a>节）很明显地看出来。当人吃食物时，这种对应关系也会表现出来。如果他在说话和倾听的时候吃饭，那么接收乳糜的血管就会打开，他比独自一人更能得到充分滋养。如果人们拥有对良善的情感，那么属灵真理和属灵真理上的教导就会对他们产生同样的效果。真理滋养属灵生命，这一事实在善灵和天上的天使当中尤其明显。因为善灵和天使都不断渴望获得知识和智慧；当他们缺乏这种属灵食物时，就会感到凄凉悲伤、无精打采、饥肠辘辘。在他们的渴望得到满足之前，他们不会恢复，也不会被提升进入其生命的极乐之中。不过，记忆知识若要给灵魂提供健康营养，就必须含有从真理之良善那里所获得的生命。记忆知识若没有从它们那里获得生命，虽然仍维持人的内在生命，但只维持他的属世生命，却不能维持他的属灵生命。<br />“草场”在内义上表示维持人的属灵生命之物，这一点从圣言中的其它经文也能明显看出来，如以赛亚书：<br />人使你作人民的约，复兴那地；对那被捆绑的人说，出来吧！对那在黑暗的人说，显露吧！他们在路上必得喂养，他们的牧场必在一切小山坡上。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.8.htm">49:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.9.htm">9</a>）<br />“在路上必得喂养”表示在真理上接受教导，“路”是指真理（参看<a href="627.htm">627</a>，<a href="2333.htm">2333</a>节）；“喂养”是指接受教导（<a href="5201.htm">5201</a>节）；“一切小山坡上的草场”表示靠良善来维持，因为“小山”和“大山”一样，是指爱之良善（<a href="795.htm">795</a>，<a href="796.htm">796</a>，<a href="1430.htm">1430</a>，<a href="2722.htm">2722</a>，<a href="4210.htm">4210</a>节）。<br />耶利米书：<br />那些残害、赶散我草场之羊群的牧人有祸了！（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.1.htm">23:1</a>）<br />此处“草场”表示诸如维持属灵生命的那类事物。<br /><br />锡安的首领像找不着草场的鹿。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀1.6.htm">1:6</a>）<br />“找不着草场”表示没有良善之真理。<br />以西结书：<br />我，甚至我必寻找我的羊群，我必在美好的草场牧养它们。它们的圈必在以色列高处的山上，它们必在佳美之圈中躺卧，也在以色列山肥美的草场吃草。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结34.11.htm">34:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结34.14.htm">14</a>）<br />此处“以色列山肥美的草场”表示真理之良善。<br />你们吃了美好的草场，还以为小事吗？剩下的草场，你们竟用蹄践踏了。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结34.18.htm">34:18</a>）<br />此处意思也一样。何西阿书：<br />我曾在旷野之中、干旱之地认识你。他们既得了牧草，就饱足；既得饱足，心就高傲。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何13.5.htm">13:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/何13.6.htm">6</a>）<br />约珥书：<br />牲畜哀鸣；牛群混乱，因为无草；羊群也受了困苦。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥1.18.htm">1:18</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />耶和华是我的牧者，祂使我躺卧在青草地上，领我在可安歇的水边。祂使我的灵魂苏醒。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗23.1.htm">23:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗23.3.htm">3</a>）<br /><br />耶和华造了我们，不是我们自己；我们是祂的民，也是祂草场的羊群。或我们是属祂的；是祂的民，也是祂草场的羊群（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗100.3.htm">100:3</a>）<br />在这些经文中，“草场”表示真理，人在真理上接受教导，在此表示与属灵生命有关的那类事物；因为属灵生命具有这样的性质：它若缺乏这种草场，就会衰弱无力，像缺乏食物的身体那样憔悴。“草场”表示恢复并维持人的灵魂或灵的良善与真理，这一事实从主在约翰福音中的话明显看出来：<br />我就是门，凡从我进来的，必然得救，并且出入可找着草场。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.9.htm">10:9</a>）<br />此处“草场”表示那些承认主，并且唯独从祂那里寻求生命的人所拥有的良善与真理。</p>

For there is no pasture for thy servants' flock. That this signifies that memory-knowledges are wanting in which are the goods of truth, is evident from the signification of "pasture for a flock," as 
being the memory-knowledges in which are goods of truth; thus "no pasture" is memory-knowledges in which there are no goods of truth. "Pasture" in the internal sense is that which sustains the spiritual 
life, and especially is it the truth of memory-knowledge, for the soul of man desires this as the body desires food. This truth nourishes, and therefore "to feed" denotes to be instructed (see n. 
5201). That memory-knowledges and truths sustain the soul of man is very evident from man's longing to know things, and also from the correspondence of food with memory-knowledges (n. 1480, 3114, 4792, 
5147, 5293, 5340, 5342, 5576, 5579, 5915), which correspondence also shows itself in man when he is partaking of food, for if this is done while he is speaking and listening, the vessels which receive 
the chyle are opened, and he is more fully nourished than if he is alone. Spiritual truths and instructions in them would have the same effect with men if they were in the affection of good. That truths 
nourish the spiritual life is especially manifest with good spirits and with the angels in heaven, for both good spirits and angels have a constant longing to know things and to be wise; and when 
they lack this spiritual food they feel desolate, their life is languid, and they are hungry; and they are not restored and raised into the bliss of their life until their longing is satisfied. But 
in order that memory-knowledges may yield healthful nourishment to the soul, there must be in them life from the goods of truth. If there is no life from this source, the memory-knowledges do indeed sustain 
the man's interior life, but only his natural life, and not his spiritual life. [2] That "pasture" in the internal sense denotes that which sustains man's spiritual life, is also evident from 
other passages in the Word; as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     I gave thee for a covenant of the people, to restore the land; to say to them that are bound, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Be ye revealed. They 
shall feed upon the ways; and on all hillsides shall be their pasture (Isa. 49:8, 9); </p>
<p>"to feed upon the ways" denotes to be instructed in truths (that "ways" are truths, see n. 627, 2333; and that 
"to feed" is to be instructed, n. 5201); "pasture on all hillsides" denotes to be sustained from good, for "hills," like "mountains," are the goods of love (n. 795, 796, 1430, 2722, 4210). [3] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p> 
    Woe to the shepherds that destroy and scatter the flock of My pasture  where "pasture" denotes such things as sustain spiritual life. Again: </p>
<p>     The princes of Zion are become like harts; 
they have found no pasture (Lam. 1:6); </p>
<p>"they have found no pasture" denotes no truth of good. [4] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     I, even I, will search for My flock, I will feed them in a good pasture, and 
in the mountains of the height of Israel shall their fold be; thus shall they lie down in a good fold, and in fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel (Ezek. 34:11, 14); </p>
<p>where "good and 
fat pasture upon the mountains of Israel" denotes the goods of truth. Again: </p>
<p>     Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue 
of your pastures (Ezek. 34:18); </p>
<p>where the signification is similar. In Hosea: </p>
<p>     I knew thee in the wilderness, in the land of drought. When they had their pasture, then were they sated; they 
were sated, and their heart was elated (Hos. 13:5, 6). In Joel: </p>
<p>     The beast groaneth, the herds of the ox are perplexed, because they have no pasture, yea, the flocks of small cattle are made desolate 
(Joel 1:18). In David: </p>
<p>     Jehovah is my shepherd; in pasture of herb He will make me lie down; to the waters of rest He will lead me; He will restore my soul (Ps. 23:13). Again: </p>
<p>     Jehovah 
hath made us, and not we ourselves; His people, and the flock of His pasture. [Or,] therefore we are His; His people, and the flock of His pasture (Ps. 100:3). [5] "Pasture" in these passages denotes 
the truths in which man is instructed, here such things as regard spiritual life; for spiritual life is such that if this pasturage fails, it languishes and as it were pines away as does the body 
when it lacks food. That "pasture" denotes the good and truth which restore and sustain the soul or spirit of man, is clear from the Lord's words in John: </p>
<p>     I am the door; by Me if anyone enter in, 
he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out, and shall find pasture (John 10:9);  where "pasture" denotes the goods and truths which those have who acknowledge the Lord, and seek life from Him alone. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6078</b></p><p><b>6078.</b>
'For there is no pasture for the flock which belongs to your servants' means that factual knowledge holding forms of the good of truth is wanting. This is clear from the meaning of 'pasture for the flock' 
as factual knowledge holding forms of the good of truth, so that 'no pasture' means factual knowledge that does not hold any forms of the good of truth. In the internal sense 'pasture' is that which 
supports spiritual life; in particular it is truth contained in factual knowledge, for the human soul desires such truth just as the body desires food. Nourishment is derived from it, and for that 
reason 'feeding' means receiving instruction, <a href="5201.htm">5201</a>. That factual knowledge and truths sustain the human soul is quite evident from a person's desire for knowledge, as well as from the correspondence 
of food with factual knowledge, <a href="1480.htm">1480</a>, <a href="3114.htm">3114</a>, <a href="4792.htm">4792</a>, <a href="5147.htm">5147</a>, <a href="5193.htm">5193</a>, <a href="5340.htm">5340</a>, <a href="5342.htm">5342</a>, <a href="5576.htm">5576</a>, <a href="5579.htm">5579</a>, <a href="5915.htm">5915</a>. This correspondence also manifests itself when a person is eating food. If he eats it while talking and listening 
the vessels that receive the chyle are opened, and he is nourished more fully than if he is alone. Spiritual truths and instruction in them would have the same kind of effect on people if they 
were to have an affection for what is good. The fact that truths nourish spiritual life is revealed primarily among good spirits and among angels in heaven. Those spirits and angels have a constant desire 
to acquire knowledge and wisdom; and when they lack this spiritual food they feel desolate, listless, and famished. Nor are they refreshed and raised into the bliss of their life until their desires 
are satisfied. But if that factual knowledge is to yield the soul wholesome nourishment, that knowledge must contain life received from forms of the good of truth. If it does not contain life received 
from them factual knowledge still sustains a person's inner life, but his natural life, not his spiritual life. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The meaning of 'pasture' in the internal sense as that which sustains a person's 
spiritual life is also evident from other places in the Word, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I have given you as a covenant to the people, to restore the land; to say to the bound, Go out, to those who are in 
darkness, Reveal yourselves. They will feed along the ways, and on all slopes will their pasture be. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2049:8,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 49:8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Feeding along the ways' stands for receiving instruction in truths, 'the ways' being 
truths, see <a href="627.htm">627</a>, <a href="2333.htm">2333</a>, and 'feeding' receiving instruction, <a href="5201.htm">5201</a>. 'On all slopes will their pasture be' stands for being sustained with good, for 'slopes', like 'mountains' are forms of the good of 
love, <a href="795.htm">795</a>, <a href="796.htm">796</a>, <a href="1430.htm">1430</a>, <a href="2722.htm">2722</a>, <a href="4210.htm">4210</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Woe to the shepherds destroying and scattering the flock of My pasture. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2023:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 23:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Pasture' stands for the kinds of things that sustain spiritual 
life. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The princes of Zion have become like deer, they have not found pasture. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lam%201:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lam 1:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'They have not found pasture' stands for no truth of good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
I, 
even I will look for My sheep. I will feed them in a good pasture, and their fold will be on the mountains of the loftiness of Israel; there<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> they will lie down in a good fold, and on fat pasture 
they will feed upon the mountains of Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2034:11,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 34:11, 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'A good and fat pasture upon the mountains of Israel' stands for forms of the good of truth. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Is it a small 
thing to you? You feed off the good pasture but tread down with your feet the rest of your pastures. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2034:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 34:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the meaning is similar. In Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
I knew you in the wilderness, in the land 
of drought. When [they had] their pasture, they were filled; they were filled and their heart was exalted. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%2013:5,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 13:5, 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Joel, </p>
<blockquote>
The beasts groan, the herds of cattle are perplexed because they 
have no pasture, even the flocks of sheep<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> are made desolate. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%201:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 1:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah is my Shepherd; He will make me lie down in green pasture;<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> He will lead me away to still waters; 
He will restore My soul. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2023:1-3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 23:1-3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah made us and not we ourselves, His people and the flock of His pasture; therefore we are His, His people, and the flock of His pasture.<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a>

</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 'Pasture' in these quotations stands for the truths in which a person receives instruction, here the kinds of things which have regard to spiritual life. For the nature of 
spiritual life is such that if it lacks that pasture it languishes and so to speak fades away, like the body when it lacks food. The fact that 'pasture' is the goodness and truth that refresh and sustain 
a person's soul or spirit is plain from the Lord's words in John, </p>
<blockquote>
I am the door. If anyone enters through Me he will be saved, and will go in and out, and find pasture. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2010:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 10:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Pasture' 
stands for the forms of good and the truths which those people have who acknowledge the Lord and seek life from Him alone.

`Quia nullum pascuum gregi, qui servis tuis':  quod significet quod scientifica desint in quibus veri bona, constat ex significatione `pascui quod gregi' quod sint scientifica in quibus veri bona, ita 
`nullum pascuum' sunt scientifica in quibus non (x)veri bona.  Pascuum in sensu interno est id quod sustentat vitam spiritualem, et imprimis est verum scientificum, hoc enim desiderat anima hominis 
sicut corpus cibum; nutritiones inde sunt, quare `pascere' est instrui, n. 5201; quod scientifica et vera sustentent (x)animam hominis, patet manifeste a desideriis sciendi apud hominem, tum quoque a

quod vera nutriant vitam spiritualem, apprimis manifestum est apud spiritus bonos et angelos in caelo; hi et illi in continuo desiderio sciendi et sapiendi sunt, et cum spiritualis is cibus illis

animae, erit in illis vita ex veri bonis; si non inde vita, scientifica quidem sustentant vitam interiorem hominis, sed vitam ejus naturalem, non autem spiritualem. [2]Quod `pascuum' in sensu interno 
sit id quod sustentat vitam hominis spiritualem, patet etiam ab aliis locis in Verbo, ut apud Esaiam,  	Dedi te in foedus populi; ad restituendum terram, . . . ad dicendum vinctis, Exite, eis qui in
