<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6695节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">其它星球的居民</h4><br /><strong>6695.</strong>蒙主的神性怜悯，我灵的内层被打开，我由此得以与身在来世的人交谈，不仅与来自我们自己星球的人交谈，还与来自其它星球的人交谈；鉴于我一直渴望了解其它星球的居民，而且我得以知道的这些事值得一提，所以我将在接下来的各章末尾讲述它们。我不是与这些星球的居民本身交谈的，而是与以前曾住在上面的灵人和天使交谈的；这种交谈不是一天或一个星期，而是好几个月，而且有天上来的帮助，清楚指教了这些灵人和天使来自何处。有大量星球上面都有人住，灵人和天使便来自他们，这一事实在来世是众所周知的；因为凡愿意的人都被允许与他们交谈。</p>

On the inhabitants of other earths.      As of the Lord's Divine mercy the interiors of my spirit have been opened, and it has thus been granted me to speak with those who are in the other life, not 
only with those from this earth, but also with those from other earths, therefore, as it was my desire to know about these latter, and as the things that have been given me to know are worthy of mention, 
I may relate them at the end of the following chapters. I have not spoken with the inhabitants themselves of these earths, but with the spirits and angels who had been inhabitants of them; and this 
not merely for a day or a week, but for some months, with open instruction from heaven as to whence they were. That there are many earths, and men upon them, and spirits and angels from them, is very 
well known in the other life, for everyone who so desires is allowed to speak with them. </p>

THE INHABITANTS OF OTHER PLANETS </p>
<p>In the Lord's Divine mercy the interior parts of my being, those of my spirit, have been opened, and this has made it possible for me to talk to those who are in the 
next life, not only to those from our own planet but also to those from other planets. Therefore, because I have had the desire to know about the inhabitants of other planets and the things I have 
been enabled to know deserve to be recorded, let me relate those things in sections at the ends of the chapters that follow. I have not talked to actual inhabitants of those planets, only to spirits and 
angels who had formerly inhabited them. I have done so not just for a day or a week but for a number of months, with the help of plain teaching from heaven as to where those spirits and angels were 
from. The fact that there is a large number of planets with people on them and that spirits and angels come from them is very well known in the next life; for anyone who wishes is allowed to talk to them. </p>

Quia, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, mihi aperta sunt interiora quae sunt spiritus mei, ac ita loqui datum est cum illis qui in altera vita, nec solum eum illis qui ex hac tellure sunt sed etiam eum 
illis qui ex aliis telluribus, idcirco, quia hoc scire desiderium meum fuit, et quae scire datum digna memoratu sunt, licet illa ad finem capitum sequentium referre {1}. {2}Locutus non sum cum ipsis incolis 
tellurum sed cum spiritibus et angelis qui fuerant incolae ibi; et hoc non per diem aut septimanam sed per plures menses, cum aperta instructione e caelo unde essent.  Quod plures tellures sint 
et super illis homines, et inde spiritus et angeli, notissimum est in altera vita, nam cuivis si desiderat, cum illis loqui conceditur. 	@1 i quid ab illis audivi$ 	@2 Loqui non datum est$ </p>
