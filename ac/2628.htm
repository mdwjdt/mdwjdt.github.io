<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2628节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2628.</strong>“亚伯拉罕给为他所生的儿子起名”表这理性的性质是这样：它是神性。这从“亚伯拉罕”的代表物，以及“起名”、“儿子”和“为他所生”的含义清楚可知：“亚伯拉罕”代表主的神性属天之物或神性良善，这在前面已多次说明；“起名”是指本性（参看<a href="144.htm">144</a>，<a href="145.htm">145</a>，<a href="1754.htm">1754</a>，<a href="1896.htm">1896</a>，<a href="2009.htm">2009</a>节）；“儿子”是指理性（参看<a href="2623.htm">2623</a>节）；“为他所生”是指通过神性彰显。由此明显可知，“亚伯拉罕给为他所生的儿子起名”表这理性的性质是这样：它是神性。有三个奥秘通过这几句话透现给那些通晓内义的人。第一个：主的神圣人性通过神性本身彰显，这个奥秘在本节会有进一步的论述。第二个：主的神圣人性不仅从耶和华成孕，还从祂生出，因此，主就其神圣人性而言，被称为“神的儿子”、“独生子”（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">1:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.50.htm">50</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.16.htm">3:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.35.htm">35</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.36.htm">36</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.19.htm">5:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.27.htm">27</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.69.htm">6:69</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约9.35.htm">9:35</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.36.htm">10:36</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约11.27.htm">11:27</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.13.htm">14:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.14.htm">14</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.1.htm">17:1</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约20.31.htm">20:31</a>；以及其它福音书）。第三个：主的神圣人性就是耶和华的“名字”，也就是祂的性质 （参看约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.28.htm">12:28</a>）。</p>

Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him. That this signifies the quality of the rational as being Divine, is evident from the representation of Abraham, as being the Lord as to the 
Divine celestial, or the Divine Good, treated of many times before; and from the signification of "calling a name," as being the quality (see n. 144, 145, 1754, 1896, 2009); and from the signification 
of his "son," as being the rational (see n. 2623); and also from the signification of his being "born unto him," as being to come forth from the Divine. Hence it is evident that "Abraham called the name 
of his son that was born unto him," signifies the quality of the rational as being Divine.  From these few words three arcana shine forth for those who are in the internal sense: First, that the 
Lord's Divine Human came forth [exstiterit] from the Divine Itself; which is further treated of in this verse. Second, that the Lord's Divine Human was not only conceived, but also born, of Jehovah, and 
hence the Lord as to His Divine Human is called the "Son of God," and the "Only-begotten" (John 1:14, 18, 50; 3:16, 18, 35-36; 5:19-27; 6:69; 9:35; 10:36; 11:27; 14:13-14; 17:1; 20:31; and in like 
manner in the other Evangelists). Third, that the Lord's Divine Human is the "name" of Jehovah, that is, His quality (see John 12:28). </p>

'Abraham called the name of his son born to him' means the nature of the Rational was such that it was Divine. This is clear from the representation of 'Abraham' as the Lord as regards the Divine celestial 
or Divine Good, dealt with many times already; from the meaning of 'calling the name' as the essential nature, dealt with in <a href="144.htm">144</a>, <a href="145.htm">145</a>, <a href="1754.htm">1754</a>, <a href="1896.htm">1896</a>, <a href="2009.htm">2009</a>; and from the meaning of 'a son' as the rational, 
dealt with in <a href="2623.htm">2623</a>, as well as from the meaning of 'born to him' as being manifested from the Divine. From this it is evident that 'Abraham called the name of his son born to him' means that 
the nature of the Rational was such that it was Divine. From these few words the following three arcana shine through to those who possess the internal sense. The first is that the Lord's Divine Human 
was a manifestation from the Divine itself, an arcanum which is explained further in this verse; the second is that the Lord's Divine Human was not only conceived but also born from Jehovah, and therefore 
the Lord as regards the Divine Human is called the Son of God and the Only Begotten, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:%2014,%2018,%2049;%203:%2016,%2018,%2035,%2036;%205:%2019-27;%206:%2069;%209:%2035;%2010:%2036;%2011:%2027;%2014:%2013,%2014;%2017:%201;%2020:%2031&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1: 14, 18, 49; 3: 16, 18, 35, 36; 5: 19-27; 6: 69; 9: 35; 10: 36; 11: 27; 14: 13, 14; 17: 1; 20: 31</a>; and 
similarly in the other Evangelists; and the third arcanum is that the Lord's Divine Human is meant by the name of Jehovah, that is, His nature, see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2012:-28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 12:-28</a>. </p>

</p><b>2628.</b>
`Vocavit Abraham nomen filii sui nati sibi': quod significet quale ejus quod Divinum, constat ex repraesentatione `Abrahami' quod sit Dominus quoad Divinum caeleste seu Divinum Bonum, de qua multoties 
{1} prius; ex significatione `vocare nomen' quod sit quale, de qua n. 144, 145, 1754, 1896, 2009; et ex significatione `filii' quod sit rationale, de qua n. 2623; tum a significatione `nati sibi' quod 
sit existere a Divino; inde patet quod `vocavit Abraham nomen filii sui nati sibi' significet quale ejus quod Divinum.  Ex his paucis verbis elucent tria arcana illis qui in sensu interno sunt: Primum, 
quod Divinum Humanum Domini ex Ipso Divino exstiterit, de quo in hoc versu ulterius agitur: Alterum, quod Divinum Humanum Domini a Jehovah non modo conceptum, sed etiam natum sit, inde Dominus quoad 
Divinum Humanum vocatur Filius Dei, et Unigenitus, Joh. i 14, 18, (x)49; iii 16, 18, 35, 36; v 19-27; vi 69; ix 35, x 36; xi 27; xiv 13, 14; xvii 1; xx 31; similiter apud reliquos Evangelistas; Tertium, 
quod Divinum Humanum Domini sit nomen Jehovae, hoc est, quale Ipsius, videatur Joh. xii 28. 	@1 aliquoties.$ </p>
