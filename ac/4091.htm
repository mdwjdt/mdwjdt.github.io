<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4091节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4091.</strong>“在那里向我许过愿”表神圣之物。这从“许愿”的含义清楚可知，“许愿”是指希望主会提供；在论述主的至高意义上是指祂的确提供的事实（<a href="3732.htm">3732</a>节）。由于凡主所提供的，都从祂发出，凡从祂发出的，皆为神圣，故“许愿”在此表示神圣之物。“许愿”表示从主发出之物，因而表示神圣之物；这一事实乍一看似乎相去甚远。不过，这是因为人若要得到他想要的，就会许愿，通过所许的愿把自己与某种事物绑在一起，也就是把与神性相关的某种事物加到自己身上。但当这个词论及的是神性本身或主时，它就不是指任何所许的愿或誓言（vow），而是指旨意或意愿和提供，也就是一件发生的事。因此，凡神性或主所行的，皆从祂自己发出；凡从祂发出的，皆为神圣。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4091</b></p><p><b>4091.</b>
Where thou vowedst a vow unto me. That this signifies what is holy, is evident from the signification of "vowing a vow," as being to will that the Lord should provide; and in the supreme sense, in which 
it is predicated of the Lord, as being that He does provide (n. 3732); and because whatever the Lord provides proceeds from Him, and whatever proceeds from Him is holy, therefore by "vowing a vow" 
is here signified what is holy. That "vowing a vow" signifies that which proceeds from the Lord, and therefore that which is holy, at first sight appears too remote; but this is because it is a man who 
vows a vow by which he binds himself to something, or imposes something upon himself in relation to the Divine, in case he obtains his wish. But when it is the Divine Itself, or the Lord, of whom this 
is predicated, it is not then any vow, but is a willing and providing, that is, a doing. What therefore the Divine or the Lord does, proceeds from Him; and whatever proceeds from Him is holy. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4091</b></p><p><b>4091.</b>
'Where you made a vow to Me' means that which is holy. This is clear from the meaning of 'making a vow' as wishing the Lord to provide, and in the highest sense, which has reference to the Lord, as the 
fact that He does provide, dealt with in <a href="3732.htm">3732</a>. And since whatever the Lord provides proceeds from Him, and whatever proceeds from Him is holy, 'making a vow' at this point therefore means that which 
is holy. The fact that 'making a vow' means that which proceeds from the Lord, and therefore that which is holy, at first glance seems to be rather remote. But this is because it is man who makes the 
vow by which he binds himself to something, that is, imposes something on himself that has to do with the Divine, if he is to get what he wants. But when it is the Divine itself or the Lord to which 
this phrase has reference, it is not any vow at all that is meant, but willing and providing, that is, doing. That which the Divine or the Lord does therefore proceeds from Himself; and whatever proceeds 
from Himself is holy. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 4091</b>
</p><b>4091.</b>
`Quo vovisti mihi votum':  quod significet sanctum, constat a significatione `vovere votum' quod sit velle ut Dominus provideat, et in supremo sensu in quo praedicatur de Domino quod sit quod provideat, 
de qua n. 3732; et quia quicquid providet Dominus, hoc procedit ab Ipso, et quicquid procedit ab Ipso, hoc sanctum est, inde est quod hic per `vovere votum' significetur sanctum: quod `vovere 
votum' sit id quod procedit a Domino, proinde sanctum, ad primam intuitionem apparet remotius, sed hoc ex causa quia homo est qui vovet votum, quo se ad aliquod obstringit, seu sibi aliquid imponit 
erga Divinum, si potiatur optato; sed cum ipsum Divinum `est, seu Dominus', de Quo id praedicatur, tunc non est aliquod votum, sed est velle et providere, seu facere; quod itaque facit Divinum 
seu Dominus, hoc procedit ab Ipso, et quicquid procedit ab ipso, est sanctum. </p>
