<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6846节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6846.</strong>“又说，我是你父亲的神”表作为古教会之神的祂或神性。这从“父”的含义清楚可知，“父”是指古教会（参看<a href="6075.htm">6075</a>节）。古教会被称为“父”，是因为在它之后的众教会从它而生，即希伯来教会，后来在雅各后代当中所建的教会。事实上，通过摩西吩咐给雅各后代的仪式和律例并不是新的，而是之前就存在于古代诸教会当中，只是在雅各的子孙当中恢复、重建了而已。它们之所以恢复、重建，是因为在其它民族当中，它们沦为偶像崇拜，在埃及和巴比伦则沦为巫术。这些仪式和律例存在于古代教会中，这一事实从圣言中的许多经文可以看出来。正因如此，古教会由“父”来表示，在圣言中论述教会的地方也被称作“父”。古教会所敬拜的神就是神性人身方面的主，这些人都知道，他们教会的一切仪式所代表的那一位，就是主。他们当中有许多人还知道，主要降世，要将祂自己里面的人身变成神性。那个教会的人也没有将耶和华当成别的什么人，因为每当向他们显现时，祂都是作为一个神性人向他们显现，被称为“耶和华”（<a href="1343.htm">1343</a>，<a href="5663.htm">5663</a>节）；后来，祂向亚伯拉罕（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创18.2.htm">18:2</a>）、约书亚（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书5.13.htm">5:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/书5.15.htm">15</a>）、基甸（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士6.11.htm">6:11</a>）、玛挪亚和他妻子（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士13.3.htm">13:3</a>）显现。祂被承认为宇宙之神，他们当崇拜的独一神。由此可见，“你父亲的神”在内义上表示作为古教会之神的祂或神性，也就是主。但就外在历史意义而言，“父”表示亚伯拉罕，以及以撒和雅各。</p>

And He said, I am the God of thy father. That this signifies the Divine which was of the Ancient Church, is evident from the signification of "father," as being the Ancient Church (see n. 6075). The 
Ancient Church is called "father" because from it were born the churches which came after it, namely, the Hebrew Church, and afterward the church that was among the posterity of Jacob. For the rites and 
statutes which were commanded to the posterity of Jacob through Moses, were not new, but had previously existed in the ancient churches, and were only restored among the sons of Jacob. They were restored 
because with other nations they had become idolatrous, and in Egypt and in Babel had been turned into magic. That these rites and statutes existed in the ancient churches, can be seen from many 
passages in the Word. Hence then it is that the Ancient Church is meant by "father," and is also called "father" in the Word where the church is treated of. The God who was worshiped in the Ancient Church 
was the Lord as to the Divine Human, and it was known to them that it was the Lord who was represented in every rite of their church; and many of them also knew that the Lord was to come into the 
world, and was to make the Human in Himself Divine. Nor in that church was any other meant by Jehovah, for He had appeared to them as a Divine Man, and was called "Jehovah" (n. 1343, 5663), as also 
afterward to Abraham (Gen. 18:2), to Joshua (Josh. 5:13-15), to Gideon (Judges 6:11), and to Manoah and his wife (Judges 13:3). And He was acknowledged as the God of the universe, and the Only One whom 
they should adore. Hence then it is that by "the God of thy father," is meant in the internal sense the Divine which was of the Ancient Church, that is, the Lord; but in the external historic sense 
there is meant Abraham, and also Isaac and Jacob. </p>

'And He said, I am the God of your father' means Him who was the God of the Ancient Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'father' as the Ancient Church, dealt with in <a href="6075.htm">6075</a>. The reason why the Ancient 
Church is called 'father' is that from it the Churches that came after it were born - the Hebrew Church, and later on the Church among the descendants of Jacob. For the religious practices and the 
statutes decreed through Moses for Jacob's descendants were not new but had existed previously in the ancient Churches and were merely re-established among the children of Jacob. They were re-established 
because among other nations they had become idolatrous practices, and in Egypt and Babel they had been converted into magical ones. The fact that the same things had existed in ancient Churches 
becomes clear from a large number of places in the Word. So it is then that the Ancient Church is meant by 'father', and also that it is called 'father' in the Word where the subject is the Church. The 
God whom people worshipped in the Ancient Church was the Lord in respect of His Divine Human; and it was well known to those people that the Lord was the One who was represented in each particular 
religious observance of their Church. A large number of them also knew that the Lord was going to come into the world, when He would make the Human within Himself Divine. Nor did the people of that Church 
take Jehovah to mean anyone else, for whenever He appeared to them He did so as a Divine Man, and was called Jehovah, <a href="1343.htm">1343</a>, <a href="5663.htm">5663</a>, as He also appeared at a later time to Abraham, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2018:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 18:2</a> and following 
verses; to Joshua, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%205:13-15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 5:13-15</a>; to Gideon, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%206:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 6:11</a> and following verses; and to Manoah and his wife, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%2013:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 13:3</a> and following verses. He was acknowledged as God overall, and as the one and 
only God whom they were to adore. From all this one may now see that 'the God of your father' is used to mean in the internal sense Him who was the God of the Ancient Church, namely the Lord. But in 
the external sense written as history 'father' is used to mean Abraham, also Isaac, and Jacob too. </p>

`Et dixit, Ego Deus patris tui': quod significet Divinum quod Antiquae Ecclesiae, constat ex significatione `patris' quod sit Antiqua Ecclesia, de qua n. 6075; quod Antiqua Ecclesia dicatur `pater,' 
est quia ex illa natae sunt Ecclesiae quae post illam, nempe Ecclesia Hebraea, et postea Ecclesia apud Jacobi posteros; ritualia enim et statuta quae mandata fuerunt posteris Jacobi per Mosen, non fuerunt 
nova, sed fuerunt prius in antiquis Ecclesiis, et modo restaurata apud filios Jacobi {1}; restaurata sunt quia apud alias gentes idololatrica facta sunt, et in Aegypto inque Babele versa in magica; 
quod eadem fuerint in antiquis Ecclesiis, a pluribus locis in Verbo constare potest.  Inde nunc est quod Antiqua Ecclesia intelligatur per `patrem' et quoque quod dicatur `pater' in Verbo ubi agitur 
de Ecclesia.  {2}Deus Qui in Antiqua Ecclesia colebatur erat Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum; et notum erat illis quod Dominus esset Qui repraesentaretur in singulis Ecclesiae eorum ritibus; et quoque 
plures (c)eorum sciverunt quod Dominus' venturus esset in mundum, et Humanum in Se Divinum faceret; in illa Ecclesia nec alius intelligebatur per `Jehovam'; apparuerat enim illis ut {3}Divinus Homo, 
et vocabatur Jehovah, n. 1343, 5663, ut quoque postea Abrahamo, Gen. xviii 2 seq.; Josuae, v. 13-15; Guideoni, Jud. vi 11 seq.; Manoacho et uxori ejus, Jud. xiii 3 seq.; et agnitus erat pro Deo universi, 
et pro Unico Quem adorarent; inde nunc est quod per `Deum patris tui' in sensu interno intelligatur Divinum quod Antiquae Ecclesiae, hoc est, Dominus; at in sensu {4}externo historico intelligitur 
Abraham, tum Jischak, et quoque Jacob. 	@1 i posteros$ 	@2 Divinum quod$ 	@3 angelus$ 	@4 literae$ </p>
