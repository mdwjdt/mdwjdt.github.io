<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6380节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6380.</strong>“他的牙齿必因奶白亮”表神性属世层无非是真理之良善。这从“白”、“牙齿”和“奶”的含义清楚可知：“白”论及真理（参看<a href="3301.htm">3301</a>，<a href="3993.htm">3993</a>，<a href="4007.htm">4007</a>，<a href="5319.htm">5319</a>节）；“牙齿”在真正意义上是指属世之物，因为人体的坚硬部位，像牙齿、骨头和软骨，与属于属世层的最低级部分的真理和良善相对应；“奶”是指属天-属灵层，或也可说，真理之良善（<a href="2184.htm">2184</a>节）。相对于信主爱主之人而言，可以说主的神性属世层就是真理之良善；因为外在教会成员无法将思维提升高过主的神性属世层；而内在教会成员则能将思维提升至属世层之上，直达内在之物。事实上，凡信主的人都照着他提升自己思维的能力而对主形成某种概念；因为那些知道内在之物性质的人能拥有对内在之物的概念；而那些不知道内在之物性质的人则只有对外在之物的概念。这就是为何主的神性属世层被称为“真理之良善”，而事实上，祂的整个人身就是神性之爱的神性良善。</p>

And his teeth are white with milk. That this signifies that the Divine natural is nothing but the good of truth, is evident from the signification of "white," which is predicated of truth (see n. 3301, 
3993, 4007, 5319); from the signification of "teeth," as being in the genuine sense what is natural; for the things in man which are hard, as his teeth, bones, cartilages, correspond to the truths 
and goods which are of the lowest natural; and from the signification of "milk," as being the celestial spiritual, or what is the same, the good of truth (n. 2184). That the Lord's Divine natural is the 
good of truth is said relatively to men who are in faith and in love to the Lord; for they who are of the external church are not able to elevate the thought higher than to the Lord's Divine natural; 
whereas they who are of the internal church elevate the thought above the natural to what is internal. For everyone who is in faith in the Lord has an idea of Him according to his capacity of elevating 
his thoughts; for they who know the nature of what is internal can have an idea of what is internal; but they who do not know the nature of what is internal have an idea of what is external. Hence 
it is that the Lord's Divine natural is called the "good of truth," when yet His whole Human is the Divine good of the Divine love. </p>

'And his teeth white from milk' means that the Divine Natural is nothing else than the good of truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'white' as that which is used with reference to truth, dealt with 
in <a href="3301.htm">3301</a>, <a href="3993.htm">3993</a>, <a href="4007.htm">4007</a>, <a href="5319.htm">5319</a>; from the meaning of 'teeth' in the genuine sense as the natural, for the hard parts of a person's body, such as his teeth, bones, and cartilages, correspond to the truths 
and forms of good that belong to the lowest parts of the natural; and from the meaning of 'milk' as the celestial-spiritual, or what amounts to the same, the good of truth, dealt with in <a href="2184.htm">2184</a>. The Lord's 
Divine Natural is said to be the good of truth when it is considered in relation to people who believe in and love the Lord; for members of the external Church are unable to go any higher in their 
thinking than the Lord's Divine Natural, whereas the thinking of members of the internal Church goes above the natural to the Internal. For the idea of the Lord formed by anyone who believes in Him 
is conditioned by how far he can rise in his thinking. Those who are aware of what the internal is can have an idea of the internal; but those who are not aware of what the internal is have an idea of 
the external. This is why the Lord's Divine Natural is said to be the good of truth, when in fact His entire Human is the Divine Good of Divine Love. </p>

`Et albus dentibus a lacte':  quod significet quod Divinum Naturale non sit nisi quam Bonum Veri, constat (c)a significatione `albi' quod praedicetur de vero, de qua n. 3301, 3993, 4007, 5319; a significatione 
`dentium' quod in genuino sensu {1}sint naturale; quae enim dura sunt apud hominem, sicut dentes, {2}ossa, cartilagines, correspondent veris et bonis quae sunt infimi naturalis; et ex significatione 
`lactis' quod sit caeleste spirituale, seu quod idem, bonum veri, de qua n. 2184.  Quod Divinum Naturale Domini dicatur Bonum Veri, est respective ad homines qui in fide et in amore in Dominum 
sunt; qui enim ab Ecclesia externa sunt, illi cogitationem non altius elevare possunt quam ad Divinum Naturale Domini; at qui ab Ecclesia interna sunt, elevant supra naturale ad Internum; [2]nam unusquisque 
qui in fide in Dominum est, ideam de Ipso habet secundum facultatem elevandi cogitationes; qui enim sciunt quid internum {3}, illi ideam interni habere possunt, {4}qui autem non sciunt quid 
internum, ideam externi habent; inde est quod Divinum (t)Naturale Domini dicatur Bonum veri, cum tamen totum Humanum Ipsius est Divinum Bonum Divini Amoris. @1 sit$ @2 et ossa$ @3 i est$ @4 at qui$ </p>
