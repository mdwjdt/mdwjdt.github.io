<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6927节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6927.</strong>由于他们以这种方式周游宇宙，由此比其他人更能了解星系和我们太阳系范围之外的星球，所以我便和他们谈论这个话题。他们说，宇宙中有众多人类所居的星球；他们很惊讶，有人（他们称其为没有判断力的人）竟以为全能神的天堂仅由来自一个星球的灵人和天使组成；然而，与神的全能相比，即便有成千上万的星系和成千上万的星球，这些也如此之少，几乎等于没有。这些灵人继续说，他们知道宇宙中有数量超过几十万的星球；然而对无限的神性来说，这才多少呢？</p>

Because of their thus journeying through the universe, and so being able to know more than others about the worlds and earths outside the sphere of our solar system, I have also talked with them on this 
subject. They said that in the universe there are very many earths inhabited by men, and they wondered that it should be supposed by any, whom they called men of little judgment, that the heaven of 
the omnipotent God consists only of the spirits and angels who come from one earth, when yet these are so few that relatively to the omnipotence of God they are scarcely anything, even if there be myriads 
of worlds and myriads of earths. They said further that they know of there being earths in the universe numbering more than hundreds of thousands; and yet what is this to the Divine, which is infinite? </p>

Because they move in this manner throughout the universe and as a consequence know more than others about systems and planets outside the sphere of our solar system, I have talked to them on this subject 
too. They said that there are very many planets in the universe, with people on them too, and that they were amazed that some, whom they refered to as people with little judgement, could suppose 
that the heaven of an almighty God consists of spirits and angels who come from only one planet, when yet they are so few in comparison with God's almighty power as to be scarcely anything even if there 
were tens of thousands of solar systems and tens of thousands of planets. These spirits went on to say that they knew of the existence of more than several hundred thousand planets in the universe; 
yet how many was that in comparison with the Divine who is Infinite? </p>

Quia ita per universum vadunt, et inde prae aliis scire possunt de mundis et telluribus extra sphaeram mundi nostri solis, idcirco cum illis de (c)ea re etiam locutus sum; dicebant quod in universo 
perplures essent tellures, et ibi homines; et quod mirarentur quod aliqui putarent, quos exigui judicii homines vocabant, caelum omnipotentis Dei solum modo constare ex spiritibus et angelis qui ex una 
tellure veniunt, cum illi tam pauci sint ut respective {1}ad omnipotentiam Dei {2} vix aliquid sint, etiam si forent myriades mundorum et myriades tellurum; porro dicebant quod sciant tellures in universo 
ultra aliquot centena milia dari, et tamen quid hoc ad Divinum quod Infinitum? 	@1 omnipotentiae$ 	@2 i ut$ </p>
