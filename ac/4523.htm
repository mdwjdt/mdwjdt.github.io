<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4523节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">关于眼睛和光与大人的对应关系（续）</h4><br />4523.凡对空气和声音有所了解的人都能知道，耳朵的形成完完全全是为了适应它们改变的性质，以致就其肉体和物质形式而言，眼睛就对应于这类改变。凡懂得有关大气和光的知识之人都知道，就其肉体和物质形式而言，眼睛以这种方式形成是为了让它对应于这些的改变。耳朵与眼睛如此完美地与它们相对应，以致凡藏在空气和声音的自然存在中的奥秘都被刻在耳朵这个有机体上；而凡藏在大气和光的自然存在中的奥秘都被刻在眼睛这个有机体上。<br />因此，凡研究过解剖学和物理学的人都能通过研究知道，就其肉体和物质形式而言，感觉和运动器官，连同一切内脏，皆对应于自然界中所存在的各种事物；所以，整个身体是由自然界中最秘密的事物构成的，它的形成取决于它们秘密的作用力和它们神奇的流入方式。这就是为何古人把人称为小世界或小宇宙。<br />这些事情的人也能知道，凡存在于这个世界和自然系统中的东西，都不是从它自己产生的，而是从先于它自己的某种事物产生的；而这在先的某种事物也不是从它自己产生的，而是从更在先的某种事物产生的，依此类推，一直回归到那首先者，随后的事物皆依次从祂产生。它们因从祂产生，故也从祂持续存在；因为持续存在就是不断产生。由此可知，自然界的一切事物，直到其最末后的事物，无论总体还是细节，不仅从首先者那里产生，还从首先者持续存在。因为除非每一个事物不断产生，并且有一个从首先者那里延伸并与首先者联结的持续联系，否则，它就会瞬间崩塌并灭亡。</p>

CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE CORRESPONDENCE OF THE EYE AND OF LIGHT WITH THE GRAND MAN. Everyone who has any knowledge of air and sound may know that the ear is formed in precise adaptation to the nature 
of their modifications, thus that in respect to its bodily and material form, the ear corresponds to them; and he who has acquired any knowledge of the ether and light, knows that in respect to its 
bodily and material form, the eye has been formed so as to correspond to the modifications of these; and that this is so much the case that whatever secret thing has been stored up in the nature of 
air and of sound is inscribed on the organism of the ear, and whatever secret thing has been stored up in the nature of the ether and of light is inscribed on the organism of the eye.  [2] Consequently 
he who is skilled in anatomy and also in physics may know by investigation that as regards their bodily and material forms, the organs both of sense and of motion, together with all the viscera, correspond 
to various things that exist in the nature of the world; and thus that the whole body is an organ composed of the most secret things in the nature of the world, and in accordance with their 
secret forces of acting and their wonderful modes of flowing. For this reason man was called by the ancients a little world or microcosm. [3] He who knows this may also know that whatever exists in the 
world and its nature does not come forth from itself, but from what is prior to itself; and that this prior cannot come forth from itself, but from something prior to itself; and so on even to the 
First, from whom the things that follow come forth in order. And as they come forth from this, they also subsist from it; for subsistence is a perpetual coming forth. Hence it follows that all things 
in nature both in general and in particular, down to its last things, have not only come forth from the First, but also subsist from the First; for unless they were perpetually coming forth, and unless 
there were a continuous nexus, from the First, and thus with the First, they would fall to pieces and perish in an instant. </p>

THE CORRESPONDENCE OF THE EYE AND OF LIGHT WITH THE GRAND MAN - continued </p>
<p>Everyone who has any knowledge about air and sound may know that the formation of the ear is determined wholly and completely 
by the nature of the modifications of these, so that the actual physical and material ear corresponds to such modifications. And everyone who has acquired any knowledge concerning the atmosphere and 
light knows that the actual physical and material eye is formed in such a way that it corresponds to the modifications of these. So perfectly do the ear and the eye correspond to them that any arcanum 
hidden within the natural existence of air and sound is inscribed on the organism of the ear, and any arcanum hidden within the existence of the atmosphere and light is inscribed on the organism of 
the eye. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Consequently anyone who has studied anatomy and at the same time physics may know by investigation that other physical and material organs - not merely the sensory but also the motor 
ones, as well as the internal organs - correspond to things that are part of the natural world. Thus the whole body is an organ composed of the deepest arcana belonging to everything which exists within 
the natural world, and its formation is determined by the hidden forces by which all things act and the wonderful manner in which they flow. This was why the ancients called the human being a little 
world or microcosm. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 One who knows these things may also know that whatever exists in the world and in the natural system does not come into being of itself but from something prior to itself; 
and that this something prior cannot come into being of itself but from something even more prior; and so on back to Him who is the First, from whom in their ordered sequence things come into being. 
And because they come into being from Him they are also kept in being from Him, for being kept in being is constant coming into being. Consequently all things without exception, right down to the last 
that belong to the natural order, have not only come into being from the First but are also being kept in being from the First. For if every single thing were not constantly coming into being, and if 
this continuous connection extending from the First and so linked to the First did not exist, it would instantly fall to pieces and perish. </p>

Continuato de Correspondentia Oculi et Lucis cum Maximo Homine </p>
<p>Quisque qui de aere et sono aliquid novit, scire potest quod auris prorsus formata sit ad corum modificationum naturam, ita quod auris 
quoad suum corporeum et materiale illis correspondeat; et qui de aethere ac de luce aliquid scientiae hausit, novit quod oculus quoad suum corporeum et materiale illorum modificationibus correspondenter 
formatus sit; et hoc usque adeo ut quicquid arcani in natura aeris et soni reconditum est, hoc inscriptum {1} sit organismo auris, et quicquid arcani in natura aetheris et lucis, hoc in organismo 
oculi sit; [2] consequenter qui in anatomicis et simul physicis peritus est, per indagationes scire potest quod non modo organa sensoria sed etiam motoria, ut et omnia viscera, quoad illorum 
corporea et materialia correspondeant illis quae in natura mundi sunt, et `sic' quod totum corpus sit organum compositum ex omnium arcanissimis quae in natura `mundi sunt', et secundum corum sanctas 
agendi vires, (c)et mirabiles fluendi modos: inde est quod homo ab antiquis dictus sit parvulus mundus seu microcosmus. [3] Qui haec novit, etiam nosse potest quod quicquid in mundo et ejus natura 
est, non existat a se sed a priore se, et quod hoc prius non {2} possit existere a se sed a priore se, et hoc usque ad Primum, a quo ordine existent sequentia; et quia inde existunt etiam inde subsistunt, 
nam subsistentia est perpetua existentia; inde sequitur quod omnia et singula usque ad ultima naturae, a Primo non solum exstiterint, sed etiam a Primo subsistant {3}; nisi enim (t)perpetuo 
exsisterent, et nisi nexus continuus foret a {4} Primo, et sic cum Primo, momento dilaberentur et perirent.      @1 i quasi$      @2 nec$      @3 i perpetuo$      @4 i omnium quae in natura$ </p>
