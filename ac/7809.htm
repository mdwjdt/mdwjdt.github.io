<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7809.</strong>那里的灵人能与人说话；但反过来，人不能与灵人说话，除非他在接受教导时说这句话：“我不再这样做了”。他不可告诉他的任何同伴说，有一个灵人曾与他说话；否则，他会受到严厉惩罚。当这些木星灵与我同在时，一开始以为他们与自己星球的成员同在。但当我反过来和他们说话，并且我以为我可以发表这些事，他们不可惩罚或教导我时，他们意识到他们与一个陌生人同在。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7809</b></p><p><b>7809.</b>
Spirits there speak with man, but not conversely man with spirits, except these words, when he is instructed, that "he will do so no more." Nor is he allowed to tell any of his companions that a spirit 
has spoken to him; and if he does, he is severely punished. These spirits of Jupiter at first supposed that when they were with me, they were with a man of their own earth; but when in my turn I spoke 
to them, and also when I thought that I would publish such things, and they were not allowed to chastise, or to instruct me, they noticed that they were with another. </p>

Spirits there speak to a person, but the person does not talk back to them, except to utter these words when he receives instruction, I will not do it again. Nor is he allowed to tell any of his own 
people that the spirit has spoken to him. If he does he is punished severely. While those spirits belonging to Jupiter were present with me they imagined at first that they were with a member of their 
own planet. But when I talked back to them, and also when I thought that I might wish to publish such experiences, and they were not allowed to chastise or instruct me, they realized that they were with 
a stranger. </p>

Spiritus ibi loquuntur cum homine, non autem vicissim homo cum {1}spiritibus, solum {2}haec verba quando instruitur, quod non amplius ita faciet.  Nec licet ei dicere alicui ex suis quod spiritus cum 
illo locutus sit; si hoc facit, severe punitur.  Putabant spiritus illi Joviales cum apud me erant, principio quod essent apud hominem suae telluris; sed cum loquerer vicissim cum illis, et quoque cum 
cogitarem quod talia vellem publico {3}dare, et (t)tunc non liceret illis castigare nec instruere, animadvertebant quod apud alium essent. 	@1 spiritu$ 	@2 quando instruitur illa verba$ 	@3 darem$ </p>
