<p><strong>[NCE]251.</strong> The meaning of the snake as all evil in general and self-love in particular is due to evil's point of origin. All evil rises out of a fixation on the senses and on facts, which is what the snake first symbolizes. As a consequence, the snake now symbolizes evil itself in any form, and specifically self-love, or hatred directed at others and at the Lord, which is the same as self-love.<br />Because the evil of hatred is multifaceted, and divides into many general categories and an even larger number of specific forms, the Word distinguishes its forms by speaking of different kinds of snakes. There are generic snakes, cockatrices, asps, bloodletting snakes, and "presters," or fire snakes; there are flying snakes and creeping ones; and there are vipers.{*1} The determining factor is differences in their venom, and the venom is hatred.<br />[2] In Isaiah, for instance:<br />Do not rejoice through and through, Philistia, that the rod striking you has been broken, because from the root of a snake a cockatrice will come out, and its fruit will be a flying fire snake. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_251/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_14_29" target=_top>Isaiah 14:29</a>)<br />The root of a snake is a reliance on the senses and on factual knowledge. A cockatrice is evil from the resulting falsity. A flying fire snake is the kind of desire felt by self-love. The same prophet deals with the same animals in another way using these words:<br />They will hatch the eggs of a cockatrice and weave the webs of a spider. Whoever eats of their eggs dies, and when one is crushed, a viper is hatched. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_251/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_59_5" target=_top>Isaiah 59:5</a>)<br />In <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_251/bible_king-james-version_revelation_12_3" target=_top>Revelation 12:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_251/bible_king-james-version_revelation_12_9" target=_top>9</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_251/bible_king-james-version_revelation_20_2" target=_top>20:2</a>, this snake is called a big red dragon and the ancient snake; it is also called a devil and satan and the one who leads the whole inhabited world astray. (In this place and others, "devil" never means an individual devil who is the ruler of the others but the total horde of evil spirits — and evil itself.)<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg here lists different types of snakes that occur in Scripture, some of which are no longer thought to exist. The meaning of "bloodletting," "flying," and "creeping" snakes seems obvious enough. By "generic snakes" he apparently means nonpoisonous snakes. A "cockatrice" (Latin regulus) was thought to be able to kill by breathing on or even looking at its victims. An "asp" (Latin aspis) was poisonous. A "prester or fire snake" (Latin prester or serpens ignitus) had a bite thought to cause a burning sensation or death by swelling. A "viper" (Latin vipera) was a poisonous snake that produced live offspring rather than eggs and was thought to be able to cause internal damage to a human being in a way that other snakes could not; see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_251/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_259#subsection-2-2" target=_top>259:2</a>.

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 251</b></p><p><b>251.</b>
The reason why the "serpent" means all evil in general, and specifically the love of self, is that all evil has had its rise from that sensuous part of the mind, and also from that memory-knowledge [scientifico], 
which at first were signified by the "serpent;" and therefore it here denotes evil of every kind, and specifically the love of self, or hatred against the neighbor and the Lord, which is 
the same thing. As this evil or hatred was various, consisting of numerous genera and still more numerous species, it is described in the Word by various kinds of serpents, as "snakes" "cockatrices" 
"asps" "adders" "fiery serpents" "serpents that fly" and "that creep" and "vipers" according to the differences of the poison, which is hatred. Thus we read in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Rejoice not thou, whole Philistia, 
because the rod which smiteth thee is broken, for out of the serpent's root shall go forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a flying fire-serpent (Isa. 14:29).The "serpent's root" denotes 
that part of the mind, or that principle, which is connected with the senses and with memory-knowledge [est sensuale et scientificum]; the "cockatrice" denotes evil originating in the falsity thence 
derived; and the "flying fire-serpent" the cupidity that comes from the love of self. By the same Prophet also similar things are elsewhere thus described: </p>
<p>     They hatch cockatrice's eggs, and weave 
the spider's web; he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and when it is crushed there cometh out a viper (Isa. 59:5). The serpent described here in Genesis is called in the Revelation the "great and red 
dragon" and the "old serpent" and also the "devil and satan" that "deceives the whole world" (12:3, 9; 20:2), where, and also in other places, by the "devil" is not meant any particular devil who is 
prince over the others, but the whole crew of evil spirits, and evil itself. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 251</b></p><p><b>251.</b>
The reason 'the serpent' is used to mean all evil in general and self-love in particular is that all evil has originated in sensory evidence and also factual knowledge, which are what the serpent meant 
first. Consequently it now means evil itself, of every kind, and in particular self-love, or hatred of the neighbour and the Lord, which is the same as self-love. Because this evil or hatred is manifold, 
there being many genera of it and even more species, it is referred to in the Word by means of different kinds of serpents, such as snakes, adders, asps, haemorrhes, presters or fiery serpents, 
flying as well as creeping serpents, and vipers.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 These vary according to differences of poison, which is hatred, as in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Rejoice not, O Philistia, all of you, that the rod which smites 
you has been broken, for from the serpent's root will come forth an adder, and its fruit will be a flying prester. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2014:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 14:19</a>.   
</blockquote>
'Serpent's root' means sensory evidence and factual knowledge, 'adder' 
evil that is the outcome of falsity arising from these, 'flying prester' desire which is the product of self-love. Similar references appear in the following from the same Prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
They hatch 
adder's eggs, and weave spider's webs; he who eats their eggs dies, and when it is pressed out a viper is hatched. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2059:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 59:5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The serpent mentioned here in Genesis is in the Book of Revelation called 
'the great fiery-red dragon', and 'the serpent of old', and also 'the devil and satan who leads the whole world astray', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2012:3,%209;%2020:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 12:3, 9; 20:2</a>. Here and elsewhere devil is never used to mean some devil 
who is the prince of the rest but the entire crew of evil spirits, and evil itself.  </p>

Quod per 'serpentem' intelligatur omne malum in genere, et amor sui in specie, est quia omne malum ex sensuali, tum ex scientifico, quae primum per 'serpentem' significata sunt, ortum est; quare nunc 
ipsum malum quodcumque, et in specie amor sui, seu odium contra proximum et Dominum, quod idem est cum amore sua.  Hoc malum seu odium, quia multiplex est et plura ejus genera et plures adhuc species, 
in Verbo distinguitur per serpentum genera, ut per angues, regulos, aspides, haemorrheos, presteres seu serpentes ignitos, per serpentes volantes ut et repentes, per viperas, ita secundum differentias 
veneni, quod est odium; ut apud Esaiam, 	[2] Ne laeteris Philistaea tota tu, quod fracta virga percutiens te, nam de radice serpentis exibit regulus, et fructus ejus prester volans, xiv 29; </p>
<p>'radix 
serpentis' est sensuale et scientificum; 'regulus' est malum ex falso inde; 'prester volans' est cupiditas quae est amoris sui: et apud eundem prophetam de iisdem aliter ita, 	Ova reguli excludent, 
et telas araneae texent; edens de ovis eorum moritur, et cum exprimitur, excluditur vipera, lix 5: </p>
<p>serpens hic in Apocalypsi vocatur 'draco rufus et magnus,' et 'serpens antiquus,' tum 	Diabolus 
et satanas, qui seducit orbem terrarum totum, xii 3, 9; xx 2; </p>
<p>hic et alibi per diabolum nusquam intelligitur aliquis diabolus ut princeps aliorum, sed omnis turba malorum spirituum, ipsumque malum. </p>
