<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4687节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4687.</strong>“我的捆起来站着”表关于主的神性人身的教义。这从“捆”和“起来站着”的含义清楚可知：“捆”是指教义，如刚才所述；“起来站着”是指将要掌权并且他们所要敬拜的至高者。敬拜的至高对象就是主的神性人身，这一点从接下来的描述明显可知，即：十一个捆向这捆下拜；在第二个梦中，太阳、月亮和十一颗星向约瑟下拜，由此表示将要掌权并且他们所要敬拜的至高者；因此论到这梦，雅各说：“难道我和你母亲、你弟兄果然要来俯伏在地，向你下拜吗？”如前所述，雅各代表主的神性真理；该神性真理的至高一面就是主自己，并且教义事物当中的至高者就是，祂的人身是神性。<br />就教义的这个至高事物而言，情况是这样：上古教会是属天的，比起其它教会更被称为人；它敬拜无限存在和该存在的无限显现。由于这个教会的人无法对一位无限存在形成任何概念，但能出于在其内在人中所能觉察到的事物和在其外在人中以其感官所能体验到的事物，以及世上的可见事物而对无限存在的无限显现形成某种概念，所以他们敬拜含有无限存在在里面的无限显现。他们发觉那含有无限存在在里面的无限显现就是一个神性人，因为他们知道，那无限显现是通过天堂从无限存在产生的。由于天堂是大人，与人的每一个部分相对应（如前几章末尾，以及接下来几章末尾所说明的），所以他们除了一个神性人的概念外，对无限存在的无限显现没有任何其它概念。因为凡从无限存在经过作为大人的天堂之物都在每一个事物中呈现出那存在的一个形像。当这个属天教会开始衰落时，他们预见到，无限显现无法再流入人的心智，因而人类将要灭亡。因此，他们通过启示得到一知识：将要使祂自己里面的人身变成神性，以这种方式变成之前就存在的无限显现，并最终与之前也存在的无限存在成为一的那一位要降生。他们在创世记（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创3.15.htm">3:15</a>）中所说关于主的预言由此而来。<br />整个事件在约翰福音中被描述如下：<br />太初有道，道与神同在，道就是神。这道太初与神同在。万物是藉着祂造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是藉着祂造的。生命在祂里头，这生命就是人的光。道成了肉身，住在我们中间，我们也见过祂的荣光，正是父独生子的荣光，充充满满地有恩典，有真理。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.4.htm">4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">14</a>）<br />“道”（即圣言）是指神性真理，这神性真理本质上就是无限存在的无限显现，是主自己的人身。这人身是神性真理的源头，这神性真理从它发出并流入天堂，然后通过天堂流入世人的心智。因此，这人身如自永恒那样统治并掌管一切事物；事实上，它与无限存在是同一个，因为祂将这人身与神性联结起来，这一切是祂通过将祂自己里面的人身也变成神性实现的。由此可见，神性真理的至高面就是主的神性人身，教会教义当中的至高事物就是，祂的人身是神性。</p>

And lo my sheaf arose, and also stood upright. That this signifies what is doctrinal concerning the Lord's Divine Human is evident from the signification of a "sheaf" as being doctrine (see just above); 
and from the signification of "arising and standing upright," as being the supreme that should reign, and that they would adore. That this is the Lord's Divine Human is evident from what follows, 
namely, that the eleven sheaves bowed down themselves to that sheaf, and in the second dream, that the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down themselves to Joseph, whereby is signified the supreme 
that should reign, and that they would adore; wherefore also Jacob says, "Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?" As before said the Divine 
truth of the Lord is what is represented by Joseph; the supreme of this is the Lord Himself, and the supreme among doctrinal things is that His Human is Divine. [2] With this supreme of doctrinal things 
the case is this: The Most Ancient Church, which was celestial, and which above all others was called Man, adored the infinite being, and the derivative infinite coming-forth; and because, from the 
things which could be perceived in their internal man and those which could be felt in their external, and from the visible things in the world, the men of that church could have no perception of the 
infinite being, but could have some perception of the derivative infinite coming-forth, they therefore adored the infinite coming forth in which is the infinite being. The infinite coming-forth in which 
is the infinite being they perceived as a Divine Man, because they knew that the infinite coming-forth was brought forth through heaven from the infinite being; and as heaven is the Grand Man, corresponding 
to each and all things that are in man (as has been shown at the end of the preceding chapters, and will be shown at the end of several to follow), they therefore could have no other idea 
of perception concerning the infinite coming forth from the infinite being, than as of a Divine Man; for whatever from the infinite being passes through heaven as the Grand Man is attended with an image 
thereof in each and all things. When that celestial church began to fall away, they foresaw that the infinite coming forth could no longer have influx into the minds of men, and that so the human race 
would perish; therefore it was revealed to them that One should be born who would make the Human in Himself Divine, and in this way become the same infinite coming-forth as had been before, and would 
at last become one with the infinite being as also it had been before. From this came their prophecy in Genesis concerning the Lord (Gen. 3:15). [3] This is described in John in these words: </p>
<p>   
  In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made. 
In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us; and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth 
(John 1:1-4, 14); </p>
<p>the "Word" is the Divine truth, which in its essence is the infinite coming-forth from the infinite being, and is the Lord Himself as to His Human. This very Human it is from which 
truth Divine now proceeds and flows into heaven, and through heaven into the minds of men; consequently which rules and governs the universe, as it has ruled and governed it from eternity; for it is 
one and the same with the infinite being, because He conjoined the Human with the Divine, which was done by this, that He made the Human in Himself also Divine. From this it is now evident that the 
supreme of truth Divine is the Lord's Divine Human, and hence that the supreme among the doctrinal things of the church is that His Human is Divine. </p>

'And behold, my sheaf arose and also stood up' means teaching concerning the Lord's Divine Human. This is clear from the meaning of 'a sheaf' as doctrinal teaching, dealt with immediately above; and 
from the meaning of 'arising and standing up' as that which is the highest and is going to reign and which they are going to worship. The highest object of worship is the Lord's Divine Human, as is evident 
from the descriptions which follow: The eleven sheaves bowed down to that sheaf, and in the second dream the sun, moon, and eleven stars bowed down to Joseph (meaning that which is highest and is 
going to reign and which they are going to worship), on account of which dreams Jacob says, 'Are we indeed to come - I and your mother, and your brothers - to bow down to you to the earth?' The Lord's 
Divine Truth is that which is represented by 'Joseph', as stated above, the highest aspect of it being the Lord Himself, and the highest among matters of doctrine being that His Human is Divine. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
So far as this highest matter of doctrine is concerned, the Most Ancient Church, which was celestial and was called Man more so than all others, worshipped the Infinite Being (Esse) and the Infinite 
Manifestation (Existens) of that Being. And because they could not have any perception of an Infinite Being, yet could have - from what they could perceive in their internal man, what they could experience 
with their senses in their external man, and what was visible to them in the world - some perception of the Infinite Manifestation of the Infinite Being, they therefore worshipped the Infinite 
Manifestation which held the Infinite Being within it. That Infinite Manifestation holding the Infinite Being within it they perceived as a Divine Man. They did so because they knew that the Infinite 
Manifestation was brought forth from the Infinite Being by means of heaven. And because heaven is the Grand Man corresponding to every single part of the human being- as has been shown at the ends 
of chapters before this one and will be shown at the ends of several more coming after it they were unable to have through perception any other conception of the Infinite Manifestation of an Infinite 
Being than that of a Divine Man. For whatever passes from the Infinite Being by way of heaven as the Grand Man presents an image of that Being in every single thing. When that celestial Church started 
to fall they foresaw that that Infinite Manifestation could not continue any longer to come into people's minds and that this being so the human race would perish. For this reason they received by revelation 
the knowledge that One was to be born who would make Divine the Human within Himself and in this way an Infinite Manifestation like that which had existed previously would come about, and would 
at length be one with the Infinite Being as this had also been previously. From this arose their prophecy concerning the Lord contained in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%203:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 3:15</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 This whole matter is described in John as 
follows, </p>
<blockquote>
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that 
was made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us; and we beheld His glory as of the Only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:1-4,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:1-4, 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The Word' is Divine Truth which in its Essence is the Infinite Manifestation of the Infinite Being, and is the Human of the Lord Himself. This Human is the source from which Divine truth 
now proceeds and flows into heaven, and through heaven into the minds of men. Consequently this Human rules and governs everything, even as it has done so from eternity; for it is one and the same 
with the Infinite being by virtue of His joining the Human to the Divine, which He effected by making even the Human within Him Divine. From this it may now be seen that the highest aspect of Divine 
truth is the Lord's Divine Human, and from this that the Church's highest matter of doctrine is that His Human is Divine. </p>

`Et ecce surrexit manipulus meus et etiam constitit': quod significet doctrinale de Domini Divino Humano, constat ex significatione `manipuli' quod sit doctrinale, de qua mox supra; et ex significatione 
`surgere et consistere' quod sit supremum quod regnaturum et quod adoraturi; hoc quod sit Divinum Humanum Domini, patet ex illis quae sequuntur (t)quod nempe `manipulo illi incurvaverint se 
undecim manipuli,' et in altero somnio `quod sol et luna et undecim stellae incurvaverint se Josepho,' per quae significatur supremum quod regnaturum et quod adoraturi, quapropter etiam Jacobus dicit, 
`an veniamus {1} ego et mater tua, et fratres tui, ad incurvandum nos tibi {2} terram?'  Divinum Verum Domini est quod per `Josephum' repraesentatur, ut supra dictum; supremum ejus est Ipse Dominus, 
et supremum inter doctrinalia quod Humanum Ipsius sit Divinum.  [2] Cum hoc supremo doctrinalium ita se habet: </p>
<p>Antiquissima Ecclesia, quae caelestis fuit et prae reliquis `homo' dicta est, adoravit 
Infinitum Esse et inde Infinitum Existens; et quia de Infinito Esse nullam perceptionem habere potuerunt, sed aliquam de Infinito inde Existente ex perceptibilibus quae in interno eorum homine, 
exque sensibilibus quae in externo, et ex aspectabilibus quae in mundo, ideo {3} adoraverunt Infinitum Existens in quo Infinitum Esse; Infinitum Existens in quo Infinitum Esse {4}, perceperunt 
ut Divinum Hominem, ex causa quia norunt quod Infinitum Existens ex Infinito Esse produceretur per caelum, quod quia est Maximus Homo correspondens omnibus et singulis quae in homine, ut ad finem capitum 
praecedentium ostensum est et ad finem aliquot sequentium {5} ostendetur, non aliam perceptionis ideam de Infinito Existente ab Infinito Esse potuerunt habere quam de Divino Homine; nam quicquid 
{6} per caelum sicut per Maximum Hominem ab Infinito Esse transit, hoc imaginem ejus secum habet in omnibus et in singulis.  Cum Ecclesia illa caelestis coepit labi, praeviderunt quod Infinitum 
illud Existens non potuisset influxum habere in mentes hominum amplius et quod sic periturum genus humanum idcirco ex revelatione habuerunt quod nasceretur Qui Humanum in Se Divinum faceret, et sic 
fieret ipsum Infinitum Existens quale fuerat antea, et tandem unum cum Infinito Esse sicut etiam fuerat antea {7}; inde propheticum eorum de Domino in Gen. iii 15.  [3] Hoc describitur ita apud 
Johannem,           In principio erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud Deum, et      Deus erat Verbum; Hoc erat in principio apud Deum; omni per      Ipsum facta sunt, et sine Ipso factum est nihil quod 
factum      est; in Ipso vita erat, et vita erat lux hominum.... Et      Verbum caro factum est, et habitavit in nobis, et vidimus      gloriam Ipsius sicut Unigeniti a Patre, plenus gratia et   
   veritate, i 1-4, 14; </p>
<p>`Verbum' est Divinum Verum quod in Essentia sua est Infinitum Existens ab Infinito Esse, et est Ipse Dominus quoad Humanum Suum; </p>
<p>Hoc Ipsum est a Quo verum Divinum nunc procedit 
et influit in caelum, et per caelum in mentes humanas, consequenter quod regit et gubernat universum sicut id rexit et gubernavit ab aeterno idem enim et unum est cum Infinito Esse, nam conjunxit 
Divino Humanum, quod factum per id quod Humanum in Se etiam Divinum fecerit.  Inde nunc constare potest quod supremum Veri Divini sit Domini Divinum Humanum, ac inde quod supremum inter doctrinali 
Ecclesiae sit quod Humanum Ipsius sit Divinum.      @1 veniemus$      @2 i ad$      @3 idcirco$      @4 ex Infinito Esse$      @5 i adhuc$      @6 quid$      @7 i et quod sic non periturum
