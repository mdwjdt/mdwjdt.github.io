<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4768节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4768.</strong>“他们拿了约瑟的外衣”表表象。这从“外衣”的含义清楚可知，“外衣”，就是此处的彩衣，是指真理的表象（参看<a href="4677.htm">4677</a>，<a href="4741.htm">4741</a>，<a href="4742.htm">4742</a>节）。接下来所论述的主题是为他们所犯的恶行开脱，在内义上是对反对刚才所说的神性真理（<a href="4766.htm">4766</a>节）的虚假的确认，这种确认通过基于圣言字义的推理所呈现的表象实现。通过出于圣言字义的解释而对虚假的一切确认都是表象，简单人通常被这些表象迷惑或误导，因为虚假被表现为真理，真理被表现为虚假。这些表象就是下面几节经文的内义所论述的主题。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4768</b></p><p><b>4768.</b>
And they took Joseph's tunic. That this signifies appearances, is evident from the signification of a "tunic," here a tunic of various colors, as being appearances of truth (see n. 4677, 4741, 4742). 
In what now follows, the subject treated of is exculpation from the wicked deed they had committed; and in the internal sense the confirmation of falsity against Divine truths (of which just above, n. 
4766), and this by appearances, which are presented by reasoning from the sense of the letter of the Word. All confirmations of falsity by interpretations from the sense of the letter of the Word are 
appearances, by which the simple are wont to be misled, and falsity to be presented as truth, and truth as falsity. These appearances are treated of in the internal sense of the following verses. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4768</b></p><p><b>4768.</b>
'They took Joseph's tunic' means appearances. This is clear from the meaning of 'tunic', in this case a tunic of various colours, as appearances of truth, dealt with in <a href="4677.htm">4677</a>, <a href="4741.htm">4741</a>, <a href="4742.htm">4742</a>. The subject 
in what follows next is the removal of blame for the crime they had committed, and in the internal sense the corroboration of falsity opposed to the Divine Truths that are dealt with just above in <a href="4766.htm">4766</a>, 
a corroboration which was effected by means of appearances presented by means of reasonings from the sense of the letter of the Word. Corroborations of falsity involving the use of interpretations 
made from the sense of the letter of the Word are in every case appearances, by which the simple are normally led astray, falsity being presented as truth, and truth as falsity .These are the matters 
that constitute the subject in the internal sense of what follows next. </p>

</p><b>4768.</b>
`Sumpserunt tunicam Josephi': quod significet apparentias, constat (c)a significatione `tunicae' hic tunicae variorum colorum quod sint apparentiae veri, de qua n. 4677, 4741, 4742.  Agitur in nunc 
sequentibus de exculpatione facinoris quod fecerunt, in sensu interno de confirmatione falsi contra Divina Vera, de quibus mox supra n. 4766, et hoc per apparentias quae sistuntur per ratiocinia ex 
sensu litterae Verbi; confirmationes falsi per interpretationes ex sensu litterae Verbi sunt omnes apparentiae, per quas simplices solent seduci, ac falsum sisti ut verum, (c)et verum ut falsum; 
de his in nunc sequentibus in sensu interno agitur. </p>
