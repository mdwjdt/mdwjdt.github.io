<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8159节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8159.</strong>“法老临近的时候”表来自那里的邪恶所生虚假的流注极其严重。这从“法老”的代表和“临近”的含义清楚可知：“法老”是指那些沉浸于邪恶所生的虚假之人（参看<a href="8132.htm">8132</a>，<a href="8135.htm">8135</a>，<a href="8146.htm">8146</a>，<a href="8148.htm">8148</a>节）；“临近”是指流注。内义所论述的主题是那些被释放之人的第一次试探，一切试探皆通过来自地狱的流注发生。因为来自地狱的灵人会激起并提取出一个人所曾做过的一切坏事和他所曾怀有的一切恶念，由此指控他，并定他的罪。结果，他的良心痛苦不安，心中充满焦虑。这些感觉是由来自地狱，尤其来自红海所代表的这个地狱的流注造成的。由此可见，就论述试探的灵义而言，“临近”表示流注。<br />由于接下来的几节经文所论述的主题是那些属于属灵教会之人的第一次试探，所以要知道，在主荣耀祂的人身，也就是使之变成神性，并以这得了荣耀的人身与他们同在之前，他们无法经受试探。在此之前，他们若真的受试探，必要屈服，因为那些属于属灵教会的人唯独通过主的神性人身得救。在主降世，并能通过神性人身为他们与地狱争战之后，那些属于属灵教会的人所要经历的试探由玛拉基书中这些话来表示：<br />万军之耶和华说：你们所寻求的主，必忽然进入祂的殿；就是你们所渴慕的立约使者，看哪，快要来到。祂来的日子，谁能当得起呢？祂显现的时候，谁能立得住呢？因为祂如炼金之人的火，如漂布之人的硷。祂必坐下如炼净银子的，必洁净利未人，熬炼他们像金银一样，他们就凭公义献供物给耶和华。那时，犹大和耶路撒冷所献的供物，必蒙耶和华看为甜蜜，仿佛永恒之日、往昔之年。（玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛3.1.htm">3:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛3.4.htm">4</a>）<br />这明显论及主的降临；“利未人”在此是指属灵教会成员，因为“利未”表示仁爱或属灵良善（<a href="3875.htm">3875</a>，<a href="4497.htm">4497</a>，<a href="4502.htm">4502</a>，<a href="4503.htm">4503</a>节）；“炼金之人的火”是指试探，就是洁净的手段，在此由“洁净、熬炼他们像金银一样”来表示；“他们给耶和华献上的供物”是指信与仁；“永恒之日”和“往昔之年”是指古代的教会，和那时敬拜主的状态。<br />至于试探，它的性质如前所述（<a href="8131.htm">8131</a>节），即：地狱与人争战，主为人争战。地狱所引入的任何虚假都会遇到一个来自神性的答复。来自地狱的虚假被注入并流入外在人或属世人，但来自神性的答复则流入内在人或属灵人。人对来自神性的这种答复的意识不如对那些虚假的；它并不触及他的单个思维，仅触及他的总体意识，然而以这种方式触及：他几乎意识不到它，只感觉到希望和随之而来的安慰；然而，这些希望和安慰却包含无数此人所不知道的祝福在里面。这些事物具有这样的性质，它们适合他的情感或爱，尤其适合他对真理和良善的情感或爱，这形成他的良知。<br />说这些事是为了叫人知道，以色列人在旷野的生活描述了那些属于主的属灵教会并被释放的人所经历的试探，是按它们发生的先后顺序描述的。他们经历试探是为了能进一步为天堂做好准备；因为通过试探，通过作为唯一手段的这些试探，良善和真理得到证实并联结起来；通过试探，仁变成信之仁，信变成仁之信。那些属于属灵教会的人必须经历试探，这一事实由主在以下经文中所说的话来表示：<br />不背着他的十字架跟从我的，不配是我的。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.38.htm">10:38</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.39.htm">39</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可8.31.htm">8:31</a>至末尾）<br /><br />耶稣对门徒说，若有人愿意跟从我，就当舍己，背起他的十字架，来跟从我。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.24.htm">16:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.25.htm">25</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.23.htm">9:23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.24.htm">24</a>）<br />路加福音：<br />凡不背着自己十字架跟从我的，也不能作我的门徒。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路14.27.htm">14:27</a>）<br />马可福音：<br />耶稣对富人说，背起十字架来跟从我。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.21.htm">10:21</a>）<br />马太福音：<br />你们不要以为我来了，是要给地上带来和平；我来并不是带和平，乃是带刀剑。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.34.htm">10:34</a>）<br />不过，要知道，在试探中，人不会争战，唯独主为此人争战，尽管表面上看，好像是这个人在争战。当主为人争战时，这个人就会在一切事上得胜。如今很少有人被允许经历试探，因为他们没有照信所要求的去生活，因此没有由真理构成的良知；凡没有因过着良善的生活而形成真理的良知之人都会屈服倒下，他后来的状态由此变得比先前更糟糕。</p>

And Pharaoh drew nigh. That this signifies the influx of falsity from evil being thence grievous, is evident from the representation of Pharaoh, as being those who are in falsities from evil (see n. 
8132, 8135, 8146, 8148); and from the signification of "drawing nigh," as being influx. In the internal sense, the subject treated of is the first temptation of those who had been liberated. All temptation 
is effected by means of an influx from the hells, for the spirits who are thence excite and draw forth all things in a man that have been evilly done and evilly thought, and thereby accuse and condemn 
him. Thereupon the conscience is troubled, and the mind comes into anxiety. This is done by influx from the hells, especially from this hell which is represented by the sea Suph. From all this 
it can be seen that by "drawing nigh," in the spiritual sense, in which temptations are treated of, is signified influx.  [2] As in the verses that now follow, the subject treated of is the first temptation 
of those who had been of the spiritual church, be it known that they could not undergo temptations until after the Lord had glorified His Human, that is, made it Divine, and in this was present 
with them. If they had been tempted before, they would have yielded, for they who were of the spiritual church were saved solely through the Divine Human of the Lord. The temptations of those who were 
of the spiritual church, which they were to undergo after the Lord came into the world, and could then from the Divine Human fight for them against the hells, are meant by these words in Malachi: </p>
<p> 
    The Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to His temple, even the angel of the covenant whom ye desire, behold He cometh, saith Jehovah Zebaoth: who may abide the day of His coming? and who shall 
stand when He appeareth? for He is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap; and He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and He shall purify the sons of Levi, and refine them as gold and 
as silver; and they shall bring unto Jehovah a meat-offering in righteousness. Then shall the meat-offering of Judah and Jerusalem be sweet to Jehovah, according to the days of eternity, and according 
to the former years (3:1-4);  clearly speaking of the Lord's coming; "the sons of Levi" here denote those who are of the spiritual church, for by "Levi" is signified charity or spiritual good (n. 
3875, 4497, 4502, 4503); "the refiner's fire" is temptation, whereby is effected purification, which is here meant by "purifying and refining them as gold and silver;" "the meat-offering which they shall 
bring to Jehovah" is faith and charity; "the days of eternity" and "the former years" denote the ancient churches, and the states of worship of the Lord at that time.  [3] As regards temptations, 
the case with them is as was said above (n. 8131), that the hells fight against man, and the Lord for man; to every falsity the hells inject, there is an answer from the Divine. The falsities which 
are from the hells are injected and flow into the external or natural man; but the answer from the Divine flows into the internal or spiritual man. This latter influx, which is from the Divine, does not 
come to the man's perception so much as do the falsities; neither does it move the singulars of his thought, but its generals, and in such a manner that it scarcely comes to the perception otherwise 
than as hope and the consequent consolation, in which there are nevertheless innumerable things of which the man is ignorant, being such things as are in agreement with his affection or love, especially 
his affection or love of truth and good, from which he has conscience.  [4] These things have been said in order that it may be known that by the life of the sons of Israel in the wilderness are 
described in their series the temptations which those underwent who had been of the Lord's spiritual church and had been liberated. They underwent temptations in order that they might be further prepared 
for heaven; for by means of temptations, and by these as the only means, goods and truths are confirmed and are conjoined; and by means of temptations charity becomes the charity of faith, and faith 
becomes the faith of charity. That they who are of the church must undergo temptations, is meant by what the Lord has said in these passages: </p>
<p>     He that does not take up his cross, and follow after 
Me, is not worthy of Me (Matt. 10:38, 39; Mark 8:31 to the end).       Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wishes to come after Me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow Me (Matt. 
16:24, 25; Luke 9:23, 24).      Whosoever does not bear his cross, and come after Me, cannot be My disciple (Luke 14:27).      Jesus said to the rich man, Come, follow Me, taking up the cross (Mark 
10:21).      Think not that I am come to send peace on the earth; I came not to send peace, but a sword (Matt. 10:34).  [5] But be it known that in temptations the man does not fight; but the Lord 
alone fights for the man, although it appears as if it were done by the man; and when the Lord fights for a man the man conquers in all things. At this day few are admitted into temptations, for the 
reason that they are not in the life of faith, and therefore not in the conscience of truth; and he who is not in the conscience of truth from the good of life, yields; whereby his subsequent state becomes 
worse than the former. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8159</b></p><p><b>8159.</b>
'And Pharaoh drew near' means an oppressive influx from there of falsity arising from evil. This is clear from the representation of 'Pharaoh' as those steeped in falsities arising from evil, dealt with 
in <a href="8132.htm">8132</a>, <a href="8135.htm">8135</a>, <a href="8146.htm">8146</a>, <a href="8148.htm">8148</a>; and from the meaning of 'drawing near' as influx. The internal sense deals with the first temptation of those who have been delivered, and all temptation comes about through 
influx from the hells. For spirits from there stir up and bring out all the wicked deeds a person has performed and wicked thoughts he has entertained, and they use these to incriminate him and condemn 
him. As a result he suffers pangs of conscience, and anxiety fills his mind. These feelings are brought about by an influx from the hells, in particular from the hell that is represented by the 
Sea Suph. From all this one may see that in the spiritual sense, which is dealing with temptations, 'drawing near' means influx. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Since the verses which immediately follow deal with the first temptation 
of those belonging to the spiritual Church, it should be realized that those people could not undergo temptations until after the Lord had glorified His Human, that is, made it Divine, and was 
present among them in this glorified Human. If they had undergone them before then they would have given way; for those belonging to the spiritual Church were saved solely by the Lord's Divine Human. 
The temptations of those belonging to the spiritual Church, which they were to undergo after the Lord had come into the world, when He would be able to fight from the Divine Human for them against 
the hells, are meant by the following words in Malachi, </p>
<p>Suddenly there will come to His temple the Lord whom you seek, and the angel of the covenant in whom you delight. Behold, He is coming, said 
Jehovah Zebaoth. Who can endure the day of His Coming, and who will stand when He appears? For He is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap. He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and 
He will purify the sons of Levi and purge them like gold, and like silver, in order that they may bring to Jehovah a minchah in righteousness. Then the minchah of Judah and Jerusalem will be acceptable 
to Jehovah, as in the days of eternity, and as in former years. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mal%203:1-4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mal 3:1-4</a>. </p>
<p>This plainly refers to the Lord's Coming. 'The sons of Levi' here are members of the spiritual Church, for 'Levi' means 
charity or spiritual good, <a href="3875.htm">3875</a>, <a href="4497.htm">4497</a>, <a href="4502.htm">4502</a>, <a href="4503.htm">4503</a>. 'A refiner's fire' is temptation, the means of purification, which 'purifying and purging them like gold and silver' is used to mean. 'The minchah' 
they will bring to Jehovah is faith and charity; and 'the days of eternity' and 'former years' are the Ancient Churches and states of worship of the Lord in those times. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 As regards the nature 
of temptations, it is as has been stated above in <a href="8131.htm">8131</a>, that the hells fight against a person and the Lord for a person. Any falsity that the hells introduce is met with a response from the Divine. The 
falsities which come from hell are thrust into and enter the external or natural man, but the response from the Divine enters the internal or spiritual man. The person is less conscious of this response 
which comes from the Divine than he is of those falsities. It does not touch his individual thoughts, only his general awareness, yet in such a way that he scarcely comes to be conscious of it except 
as hope and consequent comfort, which however hold within them countless blessings that the person has no knowledge of. These are such that they are suited to his affection or love, especially his 
affection for or love of truth and goodness, which form his conscience. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 These things have been stated to let it be known that the life of the children of Israel in the wilderness describes the 
temptations, in the sequence in which they occurred, that were undergone by those who belonged to the Lord's spiritual Church and were delivered. The reason why they underwent the temptations was in 
order that they might be prepared further for heaven. For through temptations, through them as the one and only means, forms of good and truths are corroborated and joined together. Through them charity 
becomes the charity that goes with faith, and faith becomes the faith that goes with charity. The fact that those who belong to the Church must undergo temptations is what one should understand by 
the following things the Lord said, in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Whoever does not take up his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2010:38,39&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 10:38,39</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%208:31%20end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 8:31 end</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
He said to His 
disciples, If anyone wishes to come after Me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2016:24,%2025&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 16:24, 25</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%209:23,%2024&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 9:23, 24</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
Whoever does not carry his cross and come after Me 
cannot be My disciple. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2014:27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 14:27</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Mark, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said to the rich [young ruler], Come, follow Me, taking up the cross. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2010:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 10:21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Do not think that I have come to bring peace 
on earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2010:34&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 10:34</a>. 
</blockquote>

<p><b>[5]</b>
 But it should be recognized that in temptations a person does not do the fighting; the Lord alone does it for the person, 
though the appearance is that it is done by the person. And when the Lord does the fighting for a person, the person is in all things victorious. At the present day few are allowed to experience temptations 
because they do not live as faith requires and do not therefore possess a conscience composed of truth; and anyone without a conscience composed of truth as a result of leading a good life goes 
under, and then his latter state is worse than his former. </p>

`Et Pharao appropinquavit': quod significet influxum falsi ex malo gravem inde, constat ex repraesentatione `Pharaonis' quod sint qui in falsis ex malo, de qua n. 8132, 8135, 8146, 8148; et ex significatione 
`appropinquare' quod sit influxus; in sensu interno agitur de prima tentatione illorum qui liberati sunt, ac omnis tentatio fit per influxum ab infernis; spiritus enim qui inde sunt excitant 
et depromunt omnia male acta et male cogitata quae apud hominem, et per illa incusant (c)eum (c)et damnant; inde conscientia laeditur et mens in anxietatem venit; haec fiunt per influxum ab infernis, 
imprimis ab hoc inferno quod {1}repraesentatur per `mare Suph'; ex his constare potest quod per `appropinquare' in sensu spirituali, in quo de tentationibus agitur, significetur influxus. 	2 Quia in 
versibus nunc sequentibus agitur de tentatione prima illorum qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, sciendum quod prius tentationes subire nequiverint quam postquam Dominus Humanum Suum glorificavit, hoc est, Divinum 
fecit, et in Hoc apud illos praesens esset; si prius, tunc succubuissent, nam illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali unice salvati sunt per Divinum Humanum Domini; {2}(m)tentationes illorum qui ab Ecclesia 
spirituali, quas subituri postquam Dominus in mundum venit, et tunc {3}ex Divino Humano potuit pro illis {4}contra inferna pugnare, intelliguntur per haec apud Malachiam, {5}Subito veniet ad templum 
Suum Dominus, Quem vos quaeritis, et angelus foederis quem vos desideratis; ecce venit, dixit Jehovah Zebaoth.  Quis sustinet diem adventus Ipsius, et quis consistet cum apparuerit?  Ille enim sicut 
ignis conflatoris, et sicut smegma fullonum; sedebit conflans et purgans argentum, et purificabit filios Levi, et defaecabit illos, sicut aurum et sicut argentum; ut sint adferentes Jehovae minham

tentationes attinet, illae se habent, sicut {9}supra n. 8131 dictum {10}, quod inferna pugnent contra hominem, et Dominus pro homine; ad quodcumque falsum quod inferna inferunt est responsum a Divino; 
falsa, quae ab {11}infernis, injiciuntur (c)et influunt in externum seu naturalem hominem, sed responsum a Divino influit in internum seu spiritualem; hoc, quod a Divino, non ita ad {12}perceptionem 
hominis pervenit sicut illa, nec illud singularia cogitationis movet sed communia ejus; at ita ut {13} vix ad perceptionem aliter veniat quam sicut spes et inde consolatio, in qua tamen innumerabilia

filiorum Israelis in deserto describantur tentationes in sua serie quas subiverunt illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali Domini fuerunt, (c)et liberati, quod tentationes subiverint, erat ut (x)ulterius praepararentur
