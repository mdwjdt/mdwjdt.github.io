<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4085节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4085.</strong>“神的使者在那梦中对我说，雅各；我说，我在这里”表出于神性的觉察，以及在那模糊状态下的临在。这从“说”、“神的使者”和“梦中”的含义清楚可知。“说”在圣言的历史中是指发觉，如前面频繁所述。“神的使者”是指来自神性；因为当圣言提到“使者或天使”时，它表示主的某种事物，也就是属于神性的某种事物（参看<a href="1925.htm">1925</a>，<a href="2319.htm">2319</a>，<a href="2821.htm">2821</a>，<a href="3039.htm">3039</a>节）；原因在于，天使不是出于自己，而是出于主说话，尤其在梦中说话的时候，如此处对雅各说话。而且，天使都具有这样的性情：若他们所说的良善与真理被归于他们，他们就会恼怒；他们会尽可能地剔除存在于其他人里面的这类观念，尤其存在于人里面的。因为他们知道并发觉他们所思想、意愿和付诸实践的一切良善与真理皆来源于主，因而来源于神性。由此可见，在圣言中，“天使或使者”表示主的某种事物，也就是某种神性事物。“梦中”是指处于模糊状态（参看<a href="2514.htm">2514</a>，<a href="2528.htm">2528</a>节）。雅各的回答表示在属世层里面的临在，这种临在在属世层中处于模糊状态。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4085</b></p><p><b>4085.</b>
And the angel of God said unto me in the dream, Jacob; and I said, Behold me! That this signifies perception from the Divine, and presence in that obscure state, is evident from the signification of 
"saying," in the historicals of the Word, as being to perceive (concerning which often above); and from the signification of the "angel of God," as being from the Divine; for an "angel," when mentioned 
in the Word, signifies something of the Lord, that is, something of the Divine (see n. 1925, 2319, 2821, 3039); for the reason that an angel does not speak from himself, but from the Lord, especially 
when he speaks in a dream, as here to Jacob. Moreover the angels are of such a disposition as to be indignant if anything of good and truth that they speak is attributed to them; and insofar as they 
can they remove such an idea from others, especially from man; for they know and perceive that all the good and truth which they think, will, and effect, are from the Lord, and thus from the Divine. 
From this it may be seen that by "angels" in the Word there is signified something of the Lord (that is, what is Divine)-and from the signification of "in a dream," as denoting in obscurity (see n. 2514, 
2528). Presence in the natural, and therein obscurity, is signified by Jacob's answer. </p>

'And the angel of God said to me in a dream, Jacob. And I said, Behold, here I am' means perception from the Divine, and presence within that obscurity. This is clear from the meaning of 'saying' in 
historical narratives of the Word as perceiving - often dealt with already; from the meaning of 'the angel of God' as from the Divine (for when mentioned in the Word 'an angel' means something essentially 
the Lord's, that is, something belonging to the Divine, <a href="1925.htm">1925</a>, <a href="2319.htm">2319</a>, <a href="2821.htm">2821</a>, <a href="3039.htm">3039</a>, the reason being that no angel speaks from himself but from the Lord, especially when he does so in a dream, as he 
does here to Jacob. What is more, angels are such that they are annoyed if anything of what is good and true spoken by them is attributed to themselves; and so far as possible they remove any such ideas 
existing in others, especially in man. For they know and perceive that everything good and true which they think, will, and carry into effect originates in the Lord, and so in the Divine. And from 
this it may be seen that in the Word something essentially the Lord's, that is, something Divine, is meant by 'angers'); and from the meaning of 'in a dream' as within obscurity, dealt with in <a href="2514.htm">2514</a>, <a href="2528.htm">2528</a>. 
Presence within the natural, where it dwells in obscurity, is the meaning of Jacob's reply. </p>

</p><b>4085.</b>
`Et dixit ad me angelus Dei in somnio, Jacob; et dixi, Ecce me': quod significet perceptionem ex Divino et praesentiam in obscuro, constat ex significatione `dicere' in historicis Verbi quod sit 
percipere, de qua saepius prius; ex significatione `angeli Dei' quod sit ex Divino, nam `angelus' in Verbo ubi nominatur, significat aliquid Domini, hoc est, aliquid Divini, n. 1925, (x)2319, 2821, 
3039, ex causa quia angelus non a se loquitur sed a Domino, cumprimis quando in somnio, ut hic ad Jacobum; angeli etiam tales sunt ut indignentur si illis tribuatur aliquid boni et veri quod loquuntur, 
et quantum possunt, removent ideam talem apud alios, imprimis apud hominem; sciunt enim et percipiunt quod illis ex Domino, ita ex Divino, omne bonum et verum quod cogitant, volunt, et efficiunt: 
inde constare potest quod per `angelos' in Verbo significetur aliquid Domini, hoc est, Divinum;(n) et ex significatione `in somnio' quod sit in obscuro, de qua n. 2514, 2528; praesentia in naturali, 
et ibi in obscuro, significatur per responsum Jacobi. </p>
