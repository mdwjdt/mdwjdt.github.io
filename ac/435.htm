<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>435.</strong>没人能单凭字义知道或推知，这里的“人”与他的“妻子”表“亚大与洗拉”所象征的新教会，因为“人与他的妻子”原先表上古教会及其后裔；然而，这一点通过内义及以下事实清楚可知，即接下来的一章（1-4节）再次提及人和他的妻子，以及他们的子嗣塞特，但措辞截然不同，这时则表上古教会的第一代后裔。如果这段经文没有别的含义，就没有必要在此重复同一件事，类似的，在第一章论及创造人、地的出产以及各种动物，然后第二章再次提及，由于上面所说的缘由，第一章论述了属灵之人的创造，而第二章的主题则是属天之人的创造。当重复提及同一个人或事物时，一般来说都有不同含义，只是除非通过内义，否则没人知道这层含义。在此，这种关系本身就证实了被赋予的含义，还有另外一种考虑，即人和妻子是通用的术语，它象征这里所说的母教会。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]435.</strong> The meaning of the human and his wife as the new church previously symbolized by Adah and Zillah is not something anyone can know or figure out from the literal sense, because before now, the person and his wife symbolized the earliest church and their descendants. But it can be seen from the inner sense.<br />It can also be seen from verses <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_435/bible_king-james-version_genesis_4_3-4" target=_top>3-4</a> of the next chapter [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_435/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_485" target=_top>485</a>], which say again that the human and his wife gave birth to Seth (though in completely different words), where he symbolizes the first generation to inherit the earliest church. If the symbolism were no different in this verse, there would be no need to repeat it. In the same way, the first chapter told of the creation of the human, the earth's vegetation, and the animals, and the second chapter did likewise. This was for the reason already given [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_435/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_89" target=_top>89</a>], that the first chapter spoke about the creation of the spiritual person and the second about the creation of the heavenly person. Wherever this kind of repetition concerning the very same person or thing is encountered, one occurrence has a different meaning from the other. What the meaning is can never be known except from the inner sense, although the actual thread of the story confirms it.<br />Besides, human and wife, wherever they appear, are words symbolizing the church under discussion there, in its role as a progenitor. </p>

That the "man" and his "wife" here mean the new church signified above by Adah and Zillah no one could know or infer from the literal sense, because the "man and his wife" had previously signified the 
Most Ancient Church and its posterity; but it is very evident from the internal sense, as well as from the fact that immediately afterwards, in the following chapter (verses 1-4), the man and his wife, 
and their begetting Seth, are again mentioned, but in entirely different words, and in this case there is signified the first posterity of the Most Ancient Church. If nothing else were signified in 
the passage before us, there would be no need to say the same thing here: in like manner as in the first chapter the creation of man, and of the fruits of the earth, and of the beasts, is treated of, 
and then in the second chapter they are treated of again, for the reason, as has been said, that in the first chapter it is the creation of the spiritual man that is treated of, whereas in the second 
chapter the subject is the creation of the celestial man. Whenever there is such a repetition in the mention of one and the same person or thing, it is always with a difference of signification, but 
what it is that is signified cannot possibly be known except from the internal sense. Here, the connection itself confirms the signification that has been given, and there is the additional consideration 
that man [homo] and wife are general terms which signify the parent church that is in question. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 435</b></p><p><b>435.</b>
As regards 'the man and his wife' here being used to mean the new Church which earlier on was meant by 'Adah and Zillah', this nobody can know or deduce from the sense of the letter, for previously 'the 
man (homo) and his wife' meant the Most Ancient Church and its descendants. The point is clear however from the internal sense, and also from the fact that a little further on, in verses 3 and <a href="4.htm">4</a> of 
the next chapter, reference is again made, though the wording is entirely different, to the man and his wife begetting Seth. At that point the first generation of the descendants of the Most Ancient 
Church is meant. Unless something different were meant at this point there would be no need to say the same thing again. A parallel to this exists in Chapter <a href="1.htm">1</a>, where the subject is the creation of man, 
and also of the fruits of the earth, and of beasts; followed by Chapter <a href="2.htm">2</a>, where similar events are described, the reason for the similarity being, as has been stated, that Chapter <a href="1.htm">1</a> deals with the 
creation of the spiritual man, Chapter <a href="2.htm">2</a> with the creation of the celestial man. When this kind of repetition of one and the same person or thing occurs, something different is meant on the first occasion 
from the second. But the exact meaning cannot possibly be known except from the internal sense. The actual train of thought in like manner establishes the meaning here. And there is the added consideration 
that 'man and wife' is a general expression meaning that Church, which is the subject here and from which the new Church was born.  </p>

</p><b>435.</b>
Quod per 'hominem et uxorem ejus' hic intelligatur nova Ecclesia, prius per 'Adah et Zillah' significata, nemo ex sensu litterae scire et concludere potest, quia 'homo et uxor ejus' prius significaverat 
Ecclesiam Antiquissimam et ejus posteritatem, sed ex sensu interno illud constat; tum etiam inde quod mox in capite sequente vers. {x}3 et 4 iterum dicatur de homine et uxore quod genuerint Shethum, 
sed prorsus aliis verbis, ubi significatur posteritas prima Antiquissimae Ecclesiae; si non aliud quid significaretur hic loci, non opus fuisset idem dicere; similiter ac in primo capite, ubi agitur 
de creatione hominis, tum fruticum terrae, et bestiarum, et in capite secundo similiter, ex causa, ut dictum, quod in capite primo actum sit de creatione hominis spiritualis, in sequente de creatione 
hominis caelestis; cum talis est repetitio unius ejusdemque personae ac rei, aliud in uno loco quam in altero significatur; sed quid significatur, nusquam sciri potest nisi a sensu interno: ipsa series 
rerum similiter confirmat: praeter quod 'homo et uxor' sint voces communes significantes Ecclesiam de qua et ex qua. </p>
