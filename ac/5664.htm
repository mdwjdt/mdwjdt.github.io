<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5664节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5664.</strong>“赐给你们隐藏的礼物在你们的口袋里”表它来自祂，无需他们的任何计谋。这从“隐藏的礼物”和“在口袋里归还的银子”的含义清楚可知：“隐藏的礼物”是指主在人不知道的情况下所赐予的真理与良善；“在口袋里归还的银子”是指无需他们自己的任何能力（参看<a href="5488.htm">5488</a>，<a href="5496.htm">5496</a>，<a href="5499.htm">5499</a>节）。由此明显可知，“赐给你们隐藏的礼物在你们的口袋里”表示属世层中的真理与良善来自祂，也就是说，来自主的神性人身，无需他们自己的任何能力。礼物的到来既然无需他们自己的任何能力，那么也无需他们的任何计谋。之所以用“计谋”这个词，是因为计谋对应于神的旨意；属于神旨意的，就不属于人的计谋。<br />5664a.“你们的银子早已到我这里来了”表真理看似已被他们获得。这从“银子”的含义清楚可知，“银子”是指真理（<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="2954.htm">2954</a>节）。“他们的银子早已到他这里来了”暗示他们买了，因而他们已经为自己获得了；因为“买”表示获得表示真理（<a href="5655.htm">5655</a>节）。这解释了为何“你们的银子到我这里来了”表示真理已被他们获得。然而，由于构成信的真理从来不会被任何人获得，而是由主逐渐灌输和赐予，尽管它看似是由人获得的，故我们说真理看似已被他们获得。<br />在教会，众所周知，主逐渐灌输并赐予真理；因为教会教导说，信并非源于人，而是来自神；因此，不仅信心，而且构成信的真理都来自主。然而，信之真理看似由人自己获得；事实上，他完全不知道它们是流入的，因为他对此没有任何觉知。他之所以没有这种觉知，是因为他的内层已经封闭，以致他无法拥有与灵人并天使的任何可察觉的交流；当人的内层封闭时，他不可能知道关于流注的任何事。<br />但是，要认识到，知道信之真理是一回事，相信它们完全是另一回事。那些只是知道信之真理的人把它们交付自己的记忆知识，就像他们处理其它任何知识分支的事务一样。没有这种流注，人也能为自己获得这些真理；但它们没有任何生命，这从以下事实明显看出来：恶人，甚至最坏的人所知道的信之真理，和敬畏神的义人一样多。但如前所述，对恶人来说，这些真理没有生命；因为当恶人将它们带出来时，他在每一个真理中要么看见自己的荣耀，要么看见个人利益。因此，正是对自我和世界的爱充满它们，给予它们似乎像生命那样的东西。但这生命类似地狱里的生命，被称为属灵的死亡。正因如此，当他将它们带出来时，是从记忆，而非内心把它们带出来的；而相信信之真理的人则是从内心，同时从口唇把它们带出来；因为对他来说，信之真理已深深扎根在他里面，以致它们将根扎在外部记忆，然后像结果子的树那样朝心智的内层或高层生长；在那里它们像树那样用会叶子装饰自己，最终开花，目的是为了能结果子。<br />有信仰的人也是这样。当应用信之真理时，他脑子里没有别的东西，只想着提供有用的服务，或实践仁爱，这对他来说就是“果实”。这些就是任何人都无法为自己所获得的那类真理；甚至就连最小的真理都无法被他如此获得；相反，它们都是由主白白赐予他的，并且在他生命的每时每刻都赐下。事实上，若他相信，不计其数的礼物每时每刻都在被赐下。但由于人具有这样的性质：他对流入他的事物没有觉知，因为如前所述，他若有这种觉知，就会抵制；事实上，他会认为那时他将丧失自己的自我，以及与这自我同在的自由，与这自由同在的快乐，从而一无所有，故没有这种觉知，人只知道这类事物源于他自己，或说他凭自己获得真理。这就是说“真理看似已被他们获得”这句话的意思。此外，人若要拥有赋予他的天堂自我和天堂自由，就必须貌似凭自己行良善，貌似凭自己思考真理；但当他反思时，必须承认这些良善与真理皆源于主（参看<a href="2882.htm">2882</a>，<a href="2883.htm">2883</a>，<a href="2891.htm">2891</a>节）。</p>

Gave you a hidden gift in your bags. That this signifies that it was from Him without any prudence of theirs, is evident from the signification of a "hidden gift," as being the truth and good that are 
given by the Lord without the man's knowing it; and from the signification of "silver brought back in the sacks or bags," as being without any ability of theirs (see n. 5488, 5496, 5499). From this 
it is plain that by "gave you a hidden gift in your bags" is signified that from Him, namely from the Lord's Divine Human, is truth and good in the natural without any ability of theirs; and because it 
is without their ability, it is without their prudence. The word "prudence" is used, because prudence corresponds to providence, and that which is of the Divine providence is not of man's prudence. </p>
<p>5664a. 
Your silver came to me. That this signifies that it will seem as truth procured by them, is evident from the signification of "silver," as being truth (n. 1551, 2954). Their "silver coming to 
him" means that they bought, and thus that they themselves procured; for "to buy" is to procure (n. 5655). Thus by "your silver came to me" is signified truth procured by them; but as the truth which 
is of faith is never procured by any man, but is instilled and given by the Lord, and yet seems as if acquired by man, it is said that it will seem as truth procured by them. [2] It is known in the 
church that truth is instilled and given by the Lord; for it is taught that faith is not from man but from God; thus not only confidence, but also the truths of faith are from Him. Still it appears as 
if the truths of faith were procured by the man, for he is profoundly ignorant that they flow in, because he does not perceive it. The reason why he does not perceive it is that his interiors are closed, 
so that he cannot have perceptible communication with spirits and angels; and when the interiors are closed the man can know nothing whatever about influx. [3] Be it known, however, that it is 
one thing to know the truths of faith, and quite another to believe them. They who merely know the truths of faith, charge their memory with them just as they do with the facts of any other branch of 
knowledge. These truths man can procure for himself without such an influx, but they have no life, as is plain from the fact that an evil man, even the worst, can know the truths of faith just as much 
as an upright and pious man. But as before said with the evil these truths have no life; for when an evil man brings them forth he regards in everyone of them either self-glory or gain; so that it is 
the love of self and of the world that inflates them and makes a sort of life; but it is such life as there is in hell, which is called spiritual death. Hence it is that when he brings them forth, he 
brings them forth from the memory, and not from the heart, whereas he who believes the truths of faith brings them forth from the heart at the same time as from the lips; for with him the truths of faith 
are so deeply rooted in as to have their root in the outer memory, and to grow from there toward what is interior or higher, like fruit-bearing trees; and like trees they deck themselves with leaves, 
and at last with blossoms, for the sake of the end of bearing fruit. So it is with such a man. [4] He also aims at nothing else through the truths of faith than uses, which are the practices of 
charity, which to him are the fruits. These are the truths which man cannot procure for himself, even in the smallest degree; but they are gratuitously bestowed on him by the Lord, and this in every moment 
of his life, nay, if he will believe it, without number in every moment. But as man is of such a nature as to have no perception of their flowing in, for as before said if he had the perception 
he would resist, because he would believe that he would then lose his own, and with his own his freedom, and with his freedom his delight, and would thus become a thing of nought, it is therefore brought 
about that man does not know but that he procures truths of himself. This then is what is meant by saying that it will seem as truth procured by them. Moreover, in order that a heavenly own and heavenly 
freedom may be bestowed on man, he must needs do good as of himself and think what is true as of himself; but when he reflects he should acknowledge that these are from the Lord (see n. 2882, 2883, 2891). </p>

'Has given you the concealed gift in your pouches' means that it came from Him without the exercise of any prudence by them. This is clear from the meaning of 'the concealed gift' as truth and good conferred 
by the Lord without man's knowledge; and from the meaning of 'the silver put back in their sacks (or in their pouches)' as without expending any power of their own, dealt with in <a href="5488.htm">5488</a>, <a href="5496.htm">5496</a>, <a href="5499.htm">5499</a>. From this it is evident that 'has given you the concealed gift in your pouches' means that from Him - that is to say, from the Lord's Divine Human - came truth and good in the natural, without the 
expenditure of any power of their own. And because the gift comes without the expenditure of any power of their own, it comes without the exercise of any prudence by them. The expression prudence is 
used for the reason that prudence is the virtue [in man] that answers to providence [in God]; and what is attributable to Divine Providence is not attributable to human prudence. </p>
<p><a href="5664.htm">5664</a>[a] 'Your silver 
came to me' means that it will seem as though truth has been acquired by them. This is clear from the meaning of 'silver' as truth, dealt with in <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="2954.htm">2954</a>. The coming of their silver to him implies 
that payment had been made by them, thus that they had made an acquisition for themselves; for' buying' means acquiring, <a href="5655.htm">5655</a>. This explains why 'your silver has come to me' means that truth has 
been acquired by them. Yet because the truth which constitutes faith is never an acquisition that a person makes but is a gift instilled and conferred by the Lord, though it seems to be an acquisition 
made by that person, the expression it will seem as though truth has been acquired by them is used. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that truth is instilled and conferred by the Lord is also well known in the Church, 
for the Church teaches that faith does not originate in man but comes from God, so that not only confidence but also the truths that constitute faith come from Him. Yet the appearance is that truths 
of faith are acquired by the person himself. The fact that they flow into him is something he is totally unaware of because he has no perception of their doing so. The reason he has no such perception 
is that his interiors are closed, so that he is unable to have any communication with spirits and angels that is perceptible by him. When a person's interiors are closed he cannot know anything whatever 
about what is flowing into him.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But it should be recognized that it is one thing to know the truths of faith, another thing to believe them. Those who merely know the truths of faith consign 
them to their memory in the way they do anything else that is an item of knowledge. A person can acquire those truths without any such inflow into himself; but they do not possess any life, as is evident 
from the fact that a wicked person, even a very wicked one, can know the truths of faith just as well as an upright and God-fearing person. But in the case of the wicked, as stated, truths possess 
no life; for when a wicked person brings them forth he sees in each one either his own glory or personal gain. Consequently it is self-love and love of the world that fill those truths and give them 
what seems like life. But this life is akin to that in hell, which life is called spiritual death. Consequently, when such a person brings forth those truths he does so from his memory, not from his 
heart. But someone who has a belief in the truths of faith is bringing them forth from his heart when they pass through his lips; for in his case the truths of faith have so taken root in him that they 
strike root in the external memory and then, like fruitful trees, grow up into interior or higher levels of the mind, where tree-like they adorn themselves with leaves and at length blossom, to the 
end that they may bear fruit. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 This is what someone with belief is like. He too has nothing else in mind, when employing the truths of faith, than the performance of useful services or the exercise 
of charity, which is his 'fruit'. These are not the kind that anyone can acquire by himself. Not even the smallest can be so acquired by him; rather, the Lord gives such to him freely, doing so 
every single moment of his life. Indeed, if he will but believe it, countless gifts are imparted every single moment. But man's nature is such that he has no perception of the things that flow into him; 
for if he did have that kind of perception he would fight against the idea, as stated above, for he would then think that if the idea was true he would lose his selfhood, and with this his freedom, 
and with his freedom his delight, and so would be left with nothing. And without that perception a person knows no other than that such things originate in himself. This then is the meaning of the explanation 
'it will seem as though truth has been acquired by them'. What is more, if a person is to have a heavenly selfhood and heavenly freedom conferred on him, he must do what is good as though he 
himself were the source of it and think what is true as though he were the source of that. But when he stops to reflect he must acknowledge that such goodness and truth have their origin in the Lord,

ita quod (t)ipsi comparaverint sibi; `emere' enim est comparare, n. 5655; inde est quod per `argentum vestrum venit ad me' significetur verum comparatum ab illis; at quia verum quod fidei, nusquam comparatur 
ab aliquo homine, sed insinuatur et datur a Domino, et tamen videtur sicut ab homine, dicitur quod videbitur sicut verum comparatum ab illis. [2]Quod verum insinuetur et detur a Domino, etiam 
in Ecclesia notum est, {2}docetur enim quod fides non sit ab homine sed a Deo, ita non solum confidentia, sed etiam vera quae fidei; apparet tamen usque quod vera quae fidei, comparentur ab homine; {3}quod

ac homo probus et pius; sed apud malos, ut dictum, (t)vitam non habent, cum enim producit illa, tunc spectat in singulis vel sui gloriam, vel lucrum, inde est amor sui et mundi qui insufflant et faciunt 
quasi vitam, sed vita illa est qualis est in inferno, quae mors spiritualis vocatur; inde est, cum producit illa, quod ex memoria producat illa non autem ex corde; at qui credit vera fidei, is ex 
corde illa producit cum ex ore, sunt enim apud illum vera fidei ita radicata ut radicem habeant in memoria externa, et inde versus interiora seu superiora crescant sicut arbores frugiferae, et quoque 
sicut arbores, ornant se foliis, et tandem floribus propter finem ut fructus ferant; [4]ita homo talis, hic quoque per vera fidei nihil aliud intendit quam usus, qui sunt exercitia charitatis, quae
