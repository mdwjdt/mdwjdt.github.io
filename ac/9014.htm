<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9014节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9014.</strong>“你要把他从我的祭坛那里拿去处死”表诅咒，即便他逃去敬拜主，祈求宽恕并承诺悔改。这从“耶和华的祭坛”和“死”的含义清楚可知：“耶和华的祭坛”是指敬拜主的首要代表（<a href="921.htm">921</a>，<a href="2777.htm">2777</a>，<a href="2811.htm">2811</a>，<a href="4541.htm">4541</a>，<a href="8935.htm">8935</a>，<a href="8940.htm">8940</a>节），由于祭坛是敬拜的代表，所以“逃到祭坛那里”表示逃到主那里，祈求宽恕，以及承诺悔改，因一个行为接着另一个行为；“死”是指诅咒（<a href="5407.htm">5407</a>，<a href="6119.htm">6119</a>，<a href="9008.htm">9008</a>节）。<br />至于这一切是怎么回事，这从前面章节的说明（<a href="9013.htm">9013</a>节）可以看出来，大意是：在属灵的事物上，诡计或诡诈，也就是伪善不可能得到宽恕。原因在于，诡计或诡诈就像毒药，因为它甚至一直渗透到内层，杀死那里的信和仁的一切，毁灭余留，也就是被主储存在人之内层的信和仁的真理和良善。当这些被毁时，属灵生命的任何东西将不再存活。关于余留，可参看前文（<a href="468.htm">468</a>，<a href="530.htm">530</a>，<a href="560.htm">560</a>-<a href="563.htm">563</a>，<a href="660.htm">660</a>，<a href="661.htm">661</a>，<a href="798.htm">798</a>，<a href="1050.htm">1050</a>，<a href="1738.htm">1738</a>，<a href="1906.htm">1906</a>，<a href="2284.htm">2284</a>，<a href="5135.htm">5135</a>，<a href="5342.htm">5342</a>，<a href="5344.htm">5344</a>，<a href="5897.htm">5897</a>，<a href="5898.htm">5898</a>，<a href="6156.htm">6156</a>，<a href="7560.htm">7560</a>，<a href="7564.htm">7564</a>节）。因此，当充满诡计或诡诈的人祈求主宽恕，并承诺悔改，这由“逃到祭坛那里”来表示时，他们的祈求和承诺根本不是发自内心，仅仅是口头上作出的。因此，他们不蒙垂听，因为主看的是内心，而不是与心分离和隔绝的话语。正因如此，这种人是不得赦免或宽恕的，因为悔改对他们来说，是根本不可能的。<br />教会里的大多数人以为，罪得赦免就是抹除并洗净它们，就像用水清洗污垢那样；赦免之后人们就变得干净和纯洁了。这种观念尤其在那些将救恩的一切唯独归于信的人中间盛行。但要知道，罪得赦免完全不是这种情况。主赦免每个人的罪，因为祂是怜悯本身。然而，它们不会由此得到赦免，除非这个人实实在在地悔改，停止邪恶，然后过一种信与仁的生活，并且如此行直到他生命的结束。当做到这一点时，这个人才从主那里接受被称为新生命的属灵生命。当此人通过这新生命看到他以前生活的罪恶，远离并憎恶它们时，他的罪恶才第一次得到赦免。因为现在此人被主保持在真理和良善中，并被阻离罪恶。由此明显可知何为罪得赦免，而且这种事不可能在一个小时之内发生，也不可能在一年之内发生。教会知道这一事实，因为它对那些参加圣餐的人说，如果他们通过避免罪恶并憎恶它们而开始一种新生活，他们的罪就得赦免。<br />由此明显可知，通过诡计内层充满罪恶的假冒伪善之人是何情形，即：他们不能进行悔改。因为与他们同在的良善和真理的实际余留已经被耗光、毁尽了，与他们同在的属灵生命的一切也是如此。他们因不能进行悔改，故不能得赦免。这一切就由这条律例来表示：凡用诡计杀了邻舍的人，都要从祭坛那里拿去处死。<br />对这种人的诅咒通过大卫论到用诡计杀死押尼珥的约押所说的预言来描述：<br />愿约押家不断有患漏症的，长大麻疯的，架拐而行的，倒在剑下的，缺乏食物的。（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下3.27.htm">3:27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下3.29.htm">29</a>）<br />“患漏症的”表示对爱之良善的亵渎；“长大麻疯的”表示对信之真理的亵渎（<a href="6963.htm">6963</a>节）；“架拐而行的”或瘸子表示那些已经丧失一切良善的人（<a href="4302.htm">4302</a>，<a href="4314.htm">4314</a>节）；“倒在剑下的”表示那些不断死于虚假的人（<a href="4499.htm">4499</a>，<a href="6353.htm">6353</a>，<a href="7102.htm">7102</a>，<a href="8294.htm">8294</a>节）；“缺乏食物的”表示那些缺乏一切属灵生命的人，因为“食物”是指属灵生命靠良善维持（<a href="6118.htm">6118</a>，<a href="8410.htm">8410</a>节）。由于这种人由“约押”来表示，所以按照所罗门的命令，约押在他所逃往的祭坛旁边被杀死（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上2.28.htm">2:28</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上2.32.htm">32</a>）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9014</b></p><p><b>9014.</b>
Thou shalt take him from Mine altar, that he may die. That this signifies damnation even although he flees to the worship of the Lord, and supplicates for forgiveness, and promises repentance, is evident 
from the signification of "the altar of Jehovah," as being the chief representative of the worship of the Lord (n. 921, 2777, 2811, 4541, 8935, 8940), and because it was a representative of worship, 
therefore "to flee to the altar" denotes to flee to the Lord, and to supplicate for forgiveness, and also to promise repentance, for the one follows the other; and from the signification of "dying," 
as being damnation (n. 5407, 6119, 9008). [2] How it is in regard to this can be seen from what was shown in the paragraph above (n. 9013), namely, that in spiritual things, deceit, that is, hypocrisy, 
cannot be forgiven. The reason is that deceit is like poison, for it penetrates even to the interiors, and kills everything of faith and charity, and destroys the remains, which are the truths and 
goods of faith and charity stored up by the Lord in the interiors of man, which being destroyed nothing of spiritual life any longer survives. (With respect to remains, see n. 468, 530, 560-563, 660, 
661, 798, 1050, 1738, 1906, 2284, 5135, 5342, 5344, 5897, 5898, 6156, 7560, 7564.) Wherefore when such persons supplicate the Lord for forgiveness, and promise repentance, which is signified by "fleeing 
to the altar," they supplicate and promise nothing whatever from the heart, but only from the mouth. Therefore they are not heard, for the Lord looks at the heart, and not to words abstracted and 
estranged from the heart. Consequently for such there is no forgiveness, because no repentance is possible with them. [3] It is believed by many within the church that the forgiveness of sins is the 
wiping out and washing away thereof, as of filth by water; and that after forgiveness they go on their way clean and pure. Such an opinion prevails especially with those who ascribe everything of salvation 
to faith alone. But be it known that the case with the forgiveness of sins is quite different. The Lord forgives everyone his sins, because He is mercy itself. Nevertheless they are not thereby 
forgiven unless the man performs serious repentance, and desists from evils, and afterward lives a life of faith and charity, and this even to the end of his life. When this is done, the man receives 
from the Lord spiritual life, which is called new life. When from this new life the man views the evils of his former life, and turns away from them, and regards them with horror, then for the first 
time are the evils forgiven, for then the man is held in truths and goods by the Lord, and is withheld from evils. From this it is plain what is the forgiveness of sins, and that it cannot be granted 
within an hour, nor within a year. That this is so the church knows, for it is said to those who come to the Holy Supper that their sins are forgiven if they begin a new life by abstaining from evils 
and abhorring them. [4] From all this then it is evident how the case is with hypocrites, who through deceit are filled with evils as to the interiors, namely, that they cannot do the work of repentance; 
for the very remains of good and of truth in them have been consumed and destroyed, and therewith everything of spiritual life; and because they cannot do the work of repentance, they cannot be 
forgiven. This is signified by the statute that those who kill the neighbor with deceit should be taken from the altar that they may die. [5] The damnation of such is described by the prophetic words 
of David with respect to Joab, when he had slain Abner with deceit: </p>
<p>     There shall not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth 
by the sword, or that lacketh bread (2 Sam. 3:27, 29). "One that hath an issue" signifies the profanation of the good of love; "one that is a leper" signifies the profanation of the truth of faith 
(n. 6963); "one that leaneth on a staff," or that is lame, signifies those in whom all good has been destroyed (n. 4302, 4314); "one that falleth by the sword" signifies those who are continually 
dying through falsities (n. 4499, 6353, 7102, 8294); "one that lacketh bread" signifies those who are destitute of all spiritual life, for "bread" denotes the sustenance of spiritual life by good (n. 
6118, 8410). As such were signified by "Joab," therefore by the command of Solomon Joab was slain at the altar whither he had fled (1 Kings 2:28-32). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9014</b></p><p><b>9014.</b>
'You shall take him from My altar to die' means damnation even though he flees to worship the Lord, pleads for forgiveness, and promises to repent. This is clear from the meaning of Jehovah's altar' 
as the chief representative of worship of the Lord, dealt with in <a href="921.htm">921</a>, <a href="2777.htm">2777</a>, <a href="2811.htm">2811</a>, <a href="4541.htm">4541</a>, <a href="8935.htm">8935</a>, <a href="8940.htm">8940</a>, and since the altar was representative of worship 'fleeing to the altar' means going to the Lord, pleading 
for forgiveness, and also promising to repent, for one action follows the other; and from the meaning of 'dying' as damnation, dealt with in <a href="5407.htm">5407</a>, <a href="6119.htm">6119</a>, <a href="9008.htm">9008</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The implications of all this 
may be recognized from what has been shown in paragraph <a href="9013.htm">9013</a> above, to the effect that guile in spiritual things, that is, hypocrisy, is not able to be forgiven. The reason why is that guile is like 
poison that penetrates right through to the inward parts; it kills all of the faith and charity there, and destroys remnants, which are the truths and forms of the good of faith and charity stored away 
by the Lord in a person inwardly. And when these have been destroyed no spiritual life at all survives any longer. Regarding remnants, see <a href="468.htm">468</a>, <a href="530.htm">530</a>, <a href="560.htm">560</a>-<a href="563.htm">563</a>, <a href="660.htm">660</a>, <a href="661.htm">661</a>, <a href="798.htm">798</a>, <a href="1050.htm">1050</a>, <a href="1738.htm">1738</a>, <a href="1906.htm">1906</a>, <a href="2284.htm">2284</a>, <a href="5135.htm">5135</a>, <a href="5342.htm">5342</a>, <a href="5344.htm">5344</a>, <a href="5897.htm">5897</a>, <a href="5898.htm">5898</a>, <a href="6156.htm">6156</a>, <a href="7560.htm">7560</a>, <a href="7564.htm">7564</a>. Consequently when people full of guile plead with the Lord to be forgiven and promise to repent, meant by 'fleeing to the altar', their pleas and promises 
do not come at all from the heart but are made only with the lips. Therefore they are not heard, for the Lord looks on the heart, not on words separated and isolated from the heart. So it is that 
there is no forgiveness for them, because they are not capable of any repentance. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The majority within the Church think that the forgiveness of sins involves wiping and washing them away, like the 
removal of dirt by water, and that after forgiveness people go about clean and pure. This idea reigns especially with those who attribute all of salvation to faith alone But let it be known that the 
situation with the forgiveness of sins is altogether different from that being Mercy itself, the Lord forgives everyone their sins. Nevertheless they do not come to be forgiven unless the person sincerely 
repents, refrains from evils, and after that leads a life of faith and charity, doing so to the end of his life. When this happens the person receives spiritual life from the Lord, called new life. 
Then when with this new life he looks at the evils of his former life, turns away from them, and abhors them, his evils have for the first time been forgiven For the person is now maintained in truths 
and forms of good by the Lord and held back from evils. This shows what the forgiveness of sins is, and that it cannot take place within an hour, nor within a year. The Church knows this to be so, 
for it says to those who attend the Holy Supper that their sins are forgiven if they begin a new life by refraining from evils and abhorring them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 All this now shows what the situation is with 
hypocrites who through guile are inwardly eaten up by evils - they are incapable of repenting. For the actual remnants of goodness and truth present with them have been destroyed and lost, and everything 
of spiritual life with them. And being incapable of repenting they cannot be forgiven. This is meant by the law that those who kill their neighbour with guile must be taken from the altar to die. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
Their damnation was described by the following prophetic utterance made by David regarding Joab, who had killed Abner with guile,  </p>
<blockquote>
There will always be in the house of Joab<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> one who suffers 
from a discharge, or is a leper, or supports himself with a rod, or falls by the sword, or lacks bread. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2%20Sam%203:27,%2029&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">2 Sam 3:27, 29</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'One suffering from a discharge' means profanation of the good of love; 'a 
leper' means profanation of the truth of faith, <a href="6963.htm">6963</a>; 'one supporting himself with a rod', or a person who is lame, means those with whom all good has been lost, <a href="4302.htm">4302</a>, <a href="4314.htm">4314</a>; 'one falling by the sword' 
means those constantly dying through falsities, <a href="4499.htm">4499</a>, <a href="6353.htm">6353</a>, <a href="7102.htm">7102</a>, <a href="8294.htm">8294</a>; and 'one lacking bread' means those deprived of all spiritual life, for 'bread' is the sustainment of spiritual life by means 
of good, <a href="6118.htm">6118</a>, <a href="8410.htm">8410</a>. Because such people were meant by 'Joab' he was killed by the command of Solomon at the altar to which he had fled, <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 2:28-32.

`A cum altari Meo sumes illum ad moriendum': quod significet damnationem etiamsi fugit ad cultum Domini, et supplicat de remissione, ac promittit paenitentiam, constat (c)ex significatione `altaris 
Jehovae' quod sit principale repraesentativum cultus Domini, de qua n. 921, 2777, (x)2811, 4541, 8935, 8940; et quia {1}erat repraesentativum cultus, {2}ideo `fugere ad altare' est ad Dominum, et supplicare 
de remissione, et quoque paenitentiam promittere, nam unum sequitur alterum; et ex significatione `mori' quod sit damnatio, de qua n. 5407, 6119, 9008. 	[2] Quomodo cum his se habet, constare 
potest ex illis quae in superiore paragrapho, n. 9013 ostensa sunt, quod nempe dolus in spiritualibus, hoc est, hypocrisis, non possit remitti; causa est quia dolus est sicut venenum quod penetrat usque 
ad interiora, et necat omne fidei et charitatis, et destruit reliquias, quae sunt vera et bona fidei et charitatis in interioribus hominis a Domino recondita, quibus destructis nihil vitae spiritualis 
amplius superest; {3}de reliquiis, videatur    n. 468, 530, 560-563, 660, 661, 798, 1050, 1738, 1906, 2284, (x)5135, 5342, 5344, 5897, 5898, 6156, 7560, 7564; quapropter cum tales ad Dominum supplicant 
de remissione, et paenitentiam promittunt, quae significantur per `fugere ad altare,' nihil prorsus ex corde supplicant et promittunt sed solum ex ore, ideo non audiuntur, nam Dominus ad cor spectat 
et non ad voces a corde abstractas et abalienatas; inde nulla illis remissio, quia nulla apud illos est dabilis paenitentia. 	[3] Creditur a plerisque intra Ecclesiam quod (t)peccatorum remissio 
sit eorum abstersio et ablutio sicut sordium ab aquis, et quod post remissionem incedant mundi et puri; talis opinio regnat imprimis apud illos qui soli fidei ascribunt omne salvationis; sed sciendum 
quod cum remissione peccatorum prorsus aliter se habeat; Dominus remittit unicuique peccata, quoniam est ipsa Misericordia, sed usque ideo non `remissa' sunt nisi homo seriam paenitentiam agat, ac desistat 
a malis, (c)et dein vivat vitam fidei et charitatis, et hoc usque ad finem vitae suae; cum hoc fit, tunc homo vitam spiritualem, quae vocatur vita nova, a Domino accipit; cum ab hac vita spectat 
mala vitae suae prioris, et aversatur et horret illa, tunc primum mala remissa sunt,    nam tunc tenetur homo in veris et bonis a Domino ac detinetur a    malis; inde patet quid remissio peccatorum, 
et quod (c)illa non possit intra horam dari nec intra annum; quod ita sit, Ecclesia {5} novit, nam dicitur illis qui Sanctam Cenam obeunt, quod peccata remittantur si incohent vitam novam abstinendo 
a malis ac horrendo illa. 	[4] Ex his nunc patet quomodo se habet cum hypocritis qui inescati sunt malis per dolum quoad interiora, quod paenitentiam agere nequeant; ipsae enim reliquiae boni et veri 
apud illos consumptae et deperditae sunt, et cum illis omne vitae spiritualis; et quia (t)paenitentiam non possunt agere, non illis potest remitti.  Hoc significatur per quod sumendi sint {6}ab altari 
ad moriendum, qui proximum dolo occidunt. 	[5] Damnatio (c)eorum descripta est per Davidis prophetica de Joabo, cum is dolo occiderat Abnerum, ita, Non exscindetur a domo Joabi fluxum patiens, et

omni vita spirituali, `panis' enim est sustentatio vitae spiritualis per bonum, n. 6118, 8410; quia tales per `Joabum' significati sunt, ideo Joabus jussu Schelomonis occisus est ad altare quo
