<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5862节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5862.</strong>与人同在的灵人并不知道他们与他同在。只有主的天使知道他们与他同在，因为天使与人的灵魂或灵，而非他的肉体相联。当思维以言语的形式在身体中实现，意愿以行为的形式在身体中实现时，它们通过总体的流注依次流入；这种流注通过与大人的对应关系来掌控。故与人同在的灵人和这些事物毫无关系；因此，他们不会利用人的舌头来说话，因为这等于占有。他们也不利用他的眼睛来看世上的东西，同样不利用他的耳朵来听世上的东西。我的情况有所不同，因为主已经打开我的内层，好叫我能看见来世的东西。灵人由此知道我是一个尚在肉体中的人，他们得着机会利用我的眼睛看见世上的东西，利用我的耳朵听见同我在一起的人与我的交谈。</p>

It is not known to the spirits with man, but only to angels from the Lord, that they are with him, because they are adjoined to his soul or spirit, and not to his body. Those things which from the thoughts 
are determined into speech, and those which from the will are determined into acts in the body, flow in order into act by general influx, according to the correspondences with the Grand Man; and 
therefore the spirits who are with man have nothing in common with these things: thus they do not speak through man's tongue, which would be obsession; nor see through his eyes, nor hear through his 
ears, what is in the world. It is otherwise with me, for the Lord has opened my interiors so that I might see the things in the other life: hence spirits have known that I was a man in the body, and 
opportunity has been given them of seeing through my eyes things in the world, and of hearing those speaking to me who were in my company. </p>

The spirits present with a person do not know that they are present with him. Only an angel from the Lord knows that he is present, for angels are linked to a person's soul or spirit, but not to his 
body. When thoughts are realized in the body as speech, and wishes as actions, general influx serves as the orderly means by which they are channeled into speech or action; and this influx is governed 
by correspondences with the Grand Man. The spirits present with a person therefore have no part in any of this; so they do not use the person's tongue to speak, for that would amount to possession. Nor 
do they use his eyes to see things in the world, or his ears to hear things there. With me it is different, for the Lord has opened my interiors to enable me to see things in the next life. From this 
spirits have known that I was a person still in his body, and they have been given the ability to use my eyes to see things in the world and [my ears] to hear those talking to me in whose company I 
was present. </p>

</p><b>5862.</b>
Spiritus qui apud hominem, non sciunt quod apud hominem sint; hoc sciunt solum angeli a Domino, sunt enim adjuncti ejus animae seu spiritui, non autem ejus corpori; illa enim quae ex cogitationibus 
in loquelam et a voluntate in actus in corpore determinantur, per communem influxum, secundum correspondentias cum Maximo Homine, ordinate in actum fluunt; quapropter spiritus qui apud hominem, cum his 
nihil commune habent, {1}ita non per hominis linguam loquuntur; hoc foret obsessio; nec per ejus oculos vident quae in mundo, nec per ejus aures audiunt quae ibi. Aliter apud me, aperuit enim Dominus 
interiora mea ut videre possem quae in altera vita; inde spiritus sciverunt quod homo in corpore essem, et data (t)est illis facultas videndi per oculos meos quae in mundo, et audiendi loquentes mecum 
in consortiis. @1 nec$ </p>
