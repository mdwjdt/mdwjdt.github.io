<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3179节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3179.</strong>“他们说，我们把少女叫来问问她”表单单真理情感的同意。这从“少女”和“问问她”的含义清楚可知：“少女”是指含有纯真的情感（参看<a href="3067.htm">3067</a>，<a href="3110.htm">3110</a>节），此处是指对真理的情感，因为她是利百加，在同意之前叫“少女”，而一旦如下文那样同意了，就叫“利百加”（“利百加”是指对真理的情感，参看<a href="3077.htm">3077</a>节）；“问问她”是指觉察它是否同意。故此处表示单单真理情感的同意。<br />情况乃是这样：要被引入良善的真理本身认可自己的良善，因为良善认可自己的真理；同意便由此而来，但这是一个通过良善被赋给真理的同意（参看<a href="3161.htm">3161</a>节）。对世人来说，当真理正被引入良善，并与其联结时，即当人正在重生，或良善那一方认识到自己的真理，并将这真理引入自己，与其联结时，真理这一方从未表现出任何同意。然而，这些事恰好以这种方式发生；因为人全然不知他在重生期间所发生的事。他若仅仅知道所发生的那些事的万分之一，必会感到震惊。那时，主引领人的隐秘方式不计其数，甚至数之不尽，只有其中一些通过圣言的内义闪耀出来。<br />古教会本身对这些事的概念是通过婚姻形成的，也就是通过少女（virgin）订婚前后的状态，她即将步入婚姻时和婚后的状态，以及最后给丈夫生育子女时的状态形成。他们将良善所产的真理的果实，或仁所产的信的果实称为子女，诸如此类。这就是古教会的智慧，他们的书也是以这种风格写成的，并且这种写作方式从他们传到了外邦人那里。因为他们渴望通过那些存在于世上的事物来表达天上的事物，甚至通过属世之物看到属灵之物。而如今，这种智慧完全丧失了。 </p>

And they said, Let us call the damsel and inquire at her mouth. That this signifies the consent solely of the affection of truth, appears from the signification of a "damsel," as being an affection wherein 
is innocence (see n. 3067, 3110); here the affection of truth, because she is Rebekah, who, before she consents, is called "damsel," but when she consents, as presently follows, is called "Rebekah" 
(that "Rebekah" is the affection of truth, may be seen above, n. 3077); and from the signification of "inquiring at her mouth," as being to perceive whether this consents; thus it is the consent 
solely of the affection of truth that is here signified.  [2] The case is this: Truth itself, which is to be initiated into good, acknowledges its own good; because good acknowledges its own truth; hence 
comes consent, but that it is a consent inspired into truth from good may be seen above (n. 3161). With man it never appears that there is any consent on the part of truth when it is being initiated 
and conjoined with good (that is, when man is being regenerated), nor on the part of good as knowing its own truth, and initiating and conjoining such truth with itself; and yet these things are effected 
precisely in this way; for the things that take place during man's regeneration are altogether unknown to him; and if he were to know only one out of ten thousand of them he would be astounded. 
There are innumerable, nay, illimitable secret things by which man is at that time led of the Lord, some only of which shine forth from the internal sense of the Word.  [3] The Ancient Church formed 
for itself an idea of these things from marriages; namely, from the state of a virgin before betrothal, from her state after betrothal, from her state when she was to be wedded, afterwards when she 
was married, and lastly when she bore offspring to her husband; the fruits of truth from good, or of faith from charity, they called children, and so on. Such was the wisdom of the Ancient Church; their 
books were also written in this way; and this manner of writing was transmitted from them to the Gentiles; for it was their desire by things which are in the world to express those which are in heaven, 
and indeed from natural things to see spiritual ones; but at the present day this wisdom is altogether lost. </p>

'And they said, Let us call the girl and ask her personally' means consent solely of the affection for truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'the girl' as an affection that has innocence within it, 
dealt with in <a href="3067.htm">3067</a>, <a href="3110.htm">3110</a>, in this case the affection for truth because Rebekah is meant, who is 'the girl' before she gives her consent, but 'Rebekah' once she has given it, as in what follows immediately 
after ('Rebekah' being the affection for truth, see <a href="3077.htm">3077</a>); and from the meaning of 'asking her personally' as perceiving whether it does consent. Thus it is consent solely of the affection for 
truth that is meant here. For the situation is this: Truth itself which is to be introduced into good acknowledges its own good because good acknowledges its own truth - and from this comes consent. It 
is however a consent inspired into truth by good, see above in <a href="3161.htm">3161</a>. With man it is in no way apparent that truth for its part consents when introduced and joined to good, that is, when a person is 
being regenerated, or that good for its part knows its own truth, and introduces and joins it to itself. Yet this is exactly what happens; for a person is totally unaware of the things that take place 
while he is being regenerated. If he were to know merely one of the thousands of things that occur he would be dumbfounded. There are countless, indeed an endless number of hidden ways by which a person 
is at that time being led by the Lord, only some of which shine from the internal sense of the Word. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The Ancient Church formed for itself an idea of these things from marriages. That is to 
say, they formed that idea from a virgin's state before betrothal; from her state after she had been betrothed; from her state when she was to be given away in marriage, and after that when she had been 
given away, and finally when she bore children to her husband.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> The fruits of truth produced from good, or of faith from charity, they called children; and so on. Such was the wisdom of the Ancient 
Church. Their books were written in this style too, and the custom of writing in this fashion spread from them to the gentiles themselves. For by means of those things that exist in the world they wished 
to give expression to things in heaven; indeed from natural things they wished to see spiritual. But today that wisdom is entirely lost.

<h4>Notes</h4><small>
<a name="fn1"></a><a href="#fntext1"><sup>a</sup></a>The Latin can mean this or else when she was subject to 
her husband. But since in his rough draft Sw. first wrote gigneret prolem (bring forth offspring) the translation bore children is preferred here. </p>

`Et dixerunt, Vocemus puellam, et interrogemus os illius': quod significet consensum solum affectionis veri, constat (c)ex significatione `puellae' quod sit affectio in qua innocentia, de qua n. 3067, 
3110, hic affectio veri quia est Rebecca quae antequam consentit, dicitur `puella'; at cum consentit, ut mox sequitur, vocatur `Rebecca;' {1}quod Rebecca sit affectio veri, videatur n. 3077; et es 
significatione `interrogare os illius' quod sit percipere num consentiat ita est consensus solus affectionis veri qui hic significatur. Res {2}ita se habet: quod ipsum verum quod initiandum bono, agnoscat 
suum bonum quia bonum agnoscit suum verum, inde consensus, sed quod {3}sit consensus inspiratus vero a bono, videatur supra n. 3161: apud hominem nusquam apparet quod aliquis consensus sit a parte 
veri, cum hoc initiatur et conjungitur bono, hoc est, cum homo regeneratur, nec a parte boni quod cognoscat suum verum, et hoc initiet (c)et sibi conjungat, cum tamen haec fiunt prorsus ita; quae enim 
existunt cum regeneratur homo, ei prorsus ignota sunt; si modo sciret unum ex myriade, obstupesceret; innumerabilia, immo indefinita arcana sunt, per quae ducitur tunc homo a Domino, aliqua solum eorum 
elucent ex sensu interno Verbi: [2] Antiqua Ecclesia formavit sibi ideam illorum ex conjugiis, nempe ex virginis stata ante desponsationem, ex ejus statu postquam desponsata, ex statu cum nuptui 
danda, ac dein cum nuptui; denique cum marito pareret; (m)fructus veri ex bono, seu fidei ex charitate, vocabant `liberos,' et sic porro(n): talis fuit Antiquae Ecclesiae sapientia; libri eorum ita quoque 
scripti sunt; etiam mos ita scribendi inde ad ipsos gentiles emanavit; voluerunt enim per illa quae in mundo exprimere (c)ea quae in caelo, immo ex naturalibus videre spiritualia; sed sapientia illa 
hodie prorsus (t)deperdita est. @1 A had quod Rebecca induit hic repraesentationem affectionis veri, videatur n. 3077, but the whole sentence is deleted.$  @2 enim se ita$  @3 after inspiratus$  </p>
