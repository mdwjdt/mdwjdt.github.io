<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4415节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4415.</strong>新来的灵魂，或见习期的灵人，也就是说，肉身死后几天进入来世的人，发现来世竟然有光，都万分惊讶，因为他们带有无知的观念，即：除了太阳和物质火焰外，光再无其它源头。他们更不知道还有给理解力带来光明的光，因为他们活在肉身时并没有发现这一点；甚至不知道这光赋予思考的能力，并通过流入凭尘世之光存在的形式而展现理解力所看到的一切事物。这些见习期的灵人若为善人，就被提入天上的社群，以接受教导，并从一个社群转到另一个社群，以便他们能通过亲身经历认识到来世是有光的，并且这光比世上所能发出的还要强烈；与此同时，他们还会发现，他们在那里所居之光的量决定了聪明的程度。有些人被提入天堂之光，从那里与我说话，坦承他们从来不相信竟有这种事，相比之下，尘世之光就是黑暗。他们还从那光透过我的眼睛观看尘世之光，发现尘世之光无非是乌云，并心怀怜悯地说，这就是世人所在的光或黑暗。由此可见为何在圣言中，天上的天使被称为“光明天使”；以及对世人来说，主就是光，因而是生命（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.9.htm">9</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.12.htm">8:12</a>）。</p>

Souls newly arrived, or novitiate spirits-that is, those who have been in the other life but a few days since the death of the body-are very much surprised to find that there is light in the other life, 
for they carry with them the ignorance that supposes light to be exclusively from the sun and material flame. Still less do they know that there is any light which illumines the understanding, for 
in the bodily life they have not observed this, and even still less that this light confers the capacity to think, and by its influx into forms which are from the light of the world presents all things 
that are of the understanding. If these spirits have been good they are taken up into heavenly societies to be instructed, and are passed from one society to another, in order that they may perceive 
by living experience that there is light in the other life, and this more intense than is ever found in the world; and that they may at the same time take notice that insofar as they are in the light 
there, so far they are in intelligence. Some who were taken up into the spheres of heavenly light spoke with me from thence, and confessed that they had never believed in any such thing, and that the 
light of the world is relatively darkness. From that light they also looked through my eyes into the light of the world, and perceived it as nothing but a dark cloud, and in pity said that such is the 
light in which are men. From what has been said it may also be seen why the angels of heaven are called in the Word "angels of light;" and also that the Lord is the Light, and consequently is the life 
for men (John 1:1, 9; 8:12). </p>

Recently arrived souls, or novitiate spirits - that is to say, people who a few days after death of the body have entered the next life - are utterly amazed at the existence of light in the next life, 
for they bring with them the uninformed idea that there are no other sources of light than the sun and material flame. Still less do they know of a light which brings light to the understanding, for 
they have not observed it during their lifetime; and still less that such light provides the capacity to think, and by flowing into forms which exist from the light of the world frames everything seen 
in the understanding. If those novitiate spirits have been good people they are raised up, for the purpose of their instruction, to heavenly communities, passing from one community to another. They 
are raised up to these so that they may recognize through actual experience that light exists in the next life, a light that is brighter than that which shines in the world can ever be, and that the amount 
of light they dwell in there determines the amount of intelligence. Some borne up into spheres of heavenly light have spoken to me from there, confessing that they had never believed in any such 
thing and that the light of the world in comparison was darkness. From there they also looked through my eyes into the light of the world, which they saw to be nothing other than dark cloud. And they 
said, doing so with feelings of pity, that such was the darkness in which men dwelt. From what has been said one may also see why in the Word the angels of heaven are called angels of light; also that 
the Lord is the Light, and consequently the Life, for men, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:1-8;%208:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:1-8; 8:12</a>. </p>

Animae recentes seu spiritus novitii, qui nempe aliquot diebus post mortem corporis in alteram vitam {1} veniunt, mirantur summopere quod lux in altera vita sit, trahunt enim secum illam ignorantiam 
quod non aliunde lux sit quam a sole et a flamma materiali; et adhuc minus sciunt quod sit aliqua lux quae illuminat intellectum, nam hanc in vita corporis non apperceperunt; et adhuc minus quod 
illa lux det cogitandi facultatem, et per influxum in formas quae sunt a luce mundi, sistat omnia quae sunt intellectus; </p>
<p>illi si boni fuerunt, ut instruantur, elevantur ad societates caelestes et 
a societate in societatem, ut per vivam experientiam percipiant quod in altera vita sit lux, et illa intensior quam usquam datur in mundo, utque simul appercipiant quod quantum in luce ibi sunt, tantum 
in intelligentia sint; quidam qui sublati {2} in lucis caelestis sphaeras, inde mecum locuti sunt, et fassi quod nusquam tale {3} crediderint, et quod lux mundi respective tenebrae sit; etiam 
inde spectarunt per meos oculos in lucem mundi, et hanc non aliter perceperunt {4} quam nimbum tenebrosum; et ex miseratione dixerunt quod in tali sit homo(s).  (o)Ex his quae dicta sunt, etiam constare 
potest cur angeli caelestes in Verbo dicantur lucis angeli; et quod Dominus sit Lux et inde vita hominibus, Joh. i 1-9; viii 12.      @1 after nempe$      @2 i sunt$      @3 tali$      @4
