<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9086节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9086.</strong>“有牛或驴掉在里头”表败坏属世人中的良善或真理。这从“掉”、“牛”和“驴”的含义清楚可知：“掉”是指败坏，如下文所述；“牛”是指属世人中对邪恶的情感，因而是那里的邪恶，如前所述（<a href="9065.htm">9065</a>节）；“驴”是指属世人中的真理（<a href="2781.htm">2781</a>，<a href="5492.htm">5492</a>，<a href="5741.htm">5741</a>，<a href="7024.htm">7024</a>，<a href="8078.htm">8078</a>节）。“掉在坑里头”当论及“牛和驴”所表示的属世人中的良善和真理时，表示败坏，这一点从下一节的内容明显看出来。下一节描述了通过真理所作出的修正；这种修正在被败坏的良善和真理那里是能实现的，但在被消灭的良善和真理那里是无法实现的。因为当良善或真理被败坏时，它仍然存在，只是被曲解了。“掉”也表示因差错或不幸而滑落。<br />由于“掉在坑里头”表示这一点，故主说：<br />你们中间谁有驴或有牛，在安息日掉在井里，不立时拉它上来呢？（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路14.5.htm">14:5</a>）<br />这话是主在安息日医治一个患水臌的人时说的。在这个教会（即犹太教会），安息日最为神圣，因为它表示天上的婚姻，也就是来自主的良善与真理的结合（<a href="8495.htm">8495</a>，<a href="8510.htm">8510</a>节）。这解释了为何主在安息日进行医治，因为“医治”意味着属灵生命的医治；水臌病意味着对真理和良善的败坏；因此，医治败坏的真理意味着对它的修正和恢复。主的一切奇迹都意味着并表示教会的状态（<a href="8364.htm">8364</a>节），这也适用于总体上的一切神迹（<a href="7337.htm">7337</a>节）。正因如此，主说：“你们中间谁有驴或有牛，在安息日掉在井里，不立时拉它上来呢？”这句话在灵义上就表示刚才所说的。因为凡主所说的话，祂都是出于神性说的；并且由于每句话都来自神性，所以每个细节都有一个内义在里面（<a href="9048.htm">9048</a>，<a href="9063.htm">9063</a>e节）。在这段经文中，“井”与“坑”所表相同，即表示虚假（参看<a href="1688.htm">1688</a>节）。由于“坑”表示虚假，所以当主谈到教会的虚假时，祂还说：<br />若是瞎子领瞎子，两个人都要掉在坑里。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太15.14.htm">15:14</a>）<br />“瞎子”是指陷入错误观念的人；“掉在坑里”是指歪曲真理。说这些话是用来作比较；但在圣言中，一切比较都取自用作属灵事物标志的物体（<a href="3579.htm">3579</a>，<a href="8989.htm">8989</a>节）。<br />有些人以为，圣言所包含的神性圣洁隐藏在一个不高于显现在字面上的含义的层次上。这些人在主所说的这些话，以及圣言的其它一切经文中对圣洁的看见，唯独源于他们的信，即：他们相信圣言的一切都是神所启示的，并且无人能解释的事都是唯有神才知道的奥秘。但那些没有这种信的人则蔑视圣言，仅仅因为表面上看，它的风格不如符合时代精神的风格光鲜亮丽，就是诸如许多古代和现代作家们所采用的那种。但是，要让这些人知道，神性圣洁就隐藏在圣言的每一个和一切细节中。不过，它在于这一事实：每一个和一切细节所论述的主题都是主，以及祂的国度和教会。它的一切细节都是极其神圣的，因为它们是从主所领受的神性，因此含有永生在里面，正如主在约翰福音中所说的：<br />我对你们所说的话就是灵，就是生命。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.63.htm">6:63</a>）<br />不过，神性和神圣的事物对天上的天使来说，是清晰可见的，因为他们不以属世的方式照字义来理解圣言，只是以属灵的方式照内义来理解。世人若过着一种天使般的生活，也就是说，过一种信与爱的生活，也能照内义来理解圣言。包含在圣言内义中的事物与教会的纯正教义所教导的是同一个东西。教会的纯正教义教导主，对主的信，对祂的爱，以及对来自祂的良善的爱，这爱是对邻之仁（<a href="6709.htm">6709</a>，<a href="6710.htm">6710</a>，<a href="8123.htm">8123</a>节）。被主光照，并且看见圣言神圣事物的，是那些过着这种天使般的生活之人，根本不是其他人（参看创世记18章序言）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9086</b></p><p><b>9086.</b>
And an ox or an ass shall fall in there. That this signifies which perverts good or truth in the natural, is evident from the signification of "to fall," as being to pervert (of which below); from the 
signification of "an ox," as being the affection of evil in the natural, thus evil therein (of which above, n. 9065); and from the signification of "an ass," as being truth in the natural (n. 2781, 
5492, 5741, 7024, 8078). That "to fall into a pit," when said of good and truth in the natural, which are signified by "ox and ass," denotes to pervert, is plain from what is contained in the following 
verse, where amendment by means of truth is treated of, which can be effected with perverted goods and truths, but not with those that have been extinguished; for when good or truth is perverted, it 
still remains, although explained in a perverted manner. [2] "To fall" also denotes to fall by mischance. Because this was signified by "falling into a pit," therefore it was said by the Lord: </p>
<p>    
 Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fall into a well, and will not straightway draw him out on the Sabbath day? (Luke 14:5). This was said by the Lord when He healed on the Sabbath day the man who 
had the dropsy. In that church, the Sabbath day was most holy because it signified the heavenly marriage, which is the conjunction of good and truth from the Lord (n. 8495, 8510); consequently healings 
were performed by the Lord on the Sabbath day, because "healing" involved the healing of the spiritual life; and the disease of dropsy the perversion of truth and good; thus "healing" involved the 
amendment and restoration of perverted truth. For all the Lord's miracles involved and signified states of the church (n. 8364), as in general do all Divine miracles (n. 7337). Hence then it is that 
the Lord said, "Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fall into a well, and will not straightway draw him out on the Sabbath day?" by which was signified in the spiritual sense what has been said; 
for whatsoever the Lord spoke, He spoke from the Divine, and therefore there is an internal sense in each word (n. 9048, 9063). By "a well" in this passage the like is signified as by "a pit," namely, 
falsity (see n. 1688). And as "a pit" denotes falsity, therefore also when the Lord spoke about the falsities of the church, He said: </p>
<p>     If the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into a pit (Matt. 
15:14). "A blind man" denotes one who is in erroneous ideas; and "falling into a pit" denotes to pervert truth. These things were spoken in comparisons; but in the Word all the comparisons are taken 
from significatives (n. 3579, 8989). [3] They who believe that the Divine holiness which is in the Word lies hidden there no deeper than in the sense which appears in the letter, in these and other 
passages of the Word, see holiness from no other source than from faith that all things of the Word were Divinely inspired, and that there are inexplicable arcana therein known to God alone. But they 
who are not in this faith despise the Word, merely because the style is in appearance more humble than is the style which is adapted to the genius of the world, such as is to be found with many writers 
ancient and modern. But let them know that a Divine holiness lies hidden in each and all things of the Word, but it consists in the fact that each and all things treat of the Lord, of His kingdom, 
and His church. These are things most holy, because they are Divine from the Lord, wherein there is thus eternal life, according to the words of the Lord in John: </p>
<p>The words that I speak unto you are 
spirit, and are life (John 6:63). But these most holy Divine things stand open before the angels in heaven, because these do not apprehend the Word naturally according to the literal sense; but spiritually 
according to the internal sense. Men also would apprehend the Word according to this sense if they lived an angelic life, that is, a life of faith and love. The things which are contained in 
the internal sense of the Word are no other than those which the genuine doctrine of the church teaches. The genuine doctrine of the church teaches the Lord, faith in Him, love to Him, and love of the 
good which is from Him. This love is charity toward the neighbor (n. 6709, 6710, 8123). They who live this life are enlightened by the Lord, and see the holy things of the Word; as by no means do others 
(see the preface to Genesis 18). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9086</b></p><p><b>9086.</b>
'And an ox or an ass falls into it' means, which perverts good or truth in the natural. This is clear from the meaning of 'falling' as perverting, dealt with below; from the meaning of 'an ox' as an 
affection for evil in the natural, thus evil there, dealt with above in <a href="9065.htm">9065</a>; and from the meaning of 'an ass' as truth in the natural, dealt with in <a href="2781.htm">2781</a>, <a href="5492.htm">5492</a>, <a href="5741.htm">5741</a>, <a href="7024.htm">7024</a>, <a href="8078.htm">8078</a>. The fact that 'falling 
into a pit' - when these words refer to good and truth in the natural, which are meant by 'an ox and an ass' - means perverting is evident from the contents of the next verse. These describe amendment 
made through truth, which can be accomplished with forms of good or truths that have been perverted, but not with those which have been wiped out For when good or truth is perverted it still remains, 
but is misrepresented. 'Falling' also means slipping through error. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Because this was meant by 'falling into a pit', the Lord therefore said, </p>
<blockquote>
Which of you, having an ass or an ox that has 
fallen into a well, will not immediately pull it out on the sabbath day? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2014:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 14:5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord said this when He healed someone with dropsy on the sabbath day. In that Church the sabbath day was the 
holiest because it was a sign of the heavenly marriage, which is the joining together of goodness and truth from the Lord, <a href="8495.htm">8495</a>, <a href="8510.htm">8510</a>. This explains why healings were performed by the Lord on the sabbath 
day; for healing implied the healing of spiritual life, and dropsy implied the perversion of truth and good, so that the healing of perverted truth implied amendment and restoration. All the Lord's 
miracles implied and were signs of states of the Church, <a href="8364.htm">8364</a>, as is true of all Divine miracles in general, <a href="7337.htm">7337</a>. So it is then that the Lord said, 'Which of you, having an ass or an ox that has fallen 
into a well, will not immediately pull it out on the sabbath day?' by which in the spiritual sense what has just been stated was meant. For whatever the Lord spoke He spoke from the Divine; and 
since it came from the Divine every detail has an internal sense within it, <a href="9049.htm">9049</a>, <a href="9063.htm">9063</a> (end). 'A well' in what He said is similar in meaning to 'a pit', namely falsity, <a href="1688.htm">1688</a>. And since 'a pit' means falsity 
the Lord also said, when talking about the falsities of the Church, </p>
<blockquote>
When the blind leads the blind both fall into a pit. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2015:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 15:14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The blind' is someone with wrong ideas, and 'falling 
into a pit' means perverting truth. These words were used to make a comparison; but all comparisons in the Word were drawn from among objects used as signs of spiritual things, <a href="3579.htm">3579</a>, <a href="8989.htm">8989</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 There 
are people who believe that the Divine holiness which the Word contains lies hidden on a level no higher than the meaning apparent in the letter. Such people's vision of holiness in these words spoken 
by the Lord and in everything else in the Word arises solely from their belief that everything there is Divinely inspired, and that the things which no one can explain are arcana known only to God. 
But people who do not share that belief spurn the Word, solely because of its style, which is in appearance less polished than a style adopted to conform to the spirit of the age, such as that adopted 
by very many ancient and modern authors. But let these people know that Divine holiness lies in each and every detail of the Word. It consists however in this, that each and every detail has the Lord 
as its subject, also His kingdom and Church. All its details are extremely holy because they are Divine, received from the Lord, and so hold eternal life within them, as accords with the Lord's words 
in John, </p>
<blockquote>
The words that I speak to you, they are spirit and they are life. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%206:63&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 6:63</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>But the things that are Divine and holy are clearly visible to angels in heaven because they do not understand 
the Word in a natural way according to the literal sense, only in a spiritual way according to the internal sense. The latter sense could also be understood by people in the world if they were to 
lead an angelic life, that is to say, a life of faith and love. The things contained in the internal sense of the Word are one and the same as those which the genuine teachings of the Church present. 
Those which the genuine teachings of the Church present are the Lord, faith in Him, love to Him, and a love of the good that comes from Him, which love is charity towards the neighbour, <a href="6709.htm">6709</a>, <a href="6710.htm">6710</a>, <a href="8123.htm">8123</a>. Those who lead this angelic life, and no others at all, are enlightened by the Lord and see the holy things of the Word; see Preface to Genesis <a href="18.htm">18</a>. </p>

{1} `Et ceciderit illuc bos vel asinus': quod significet quod pervertit bonum aut verum in naturali, constat ex significatione `cadere' quod sit pervertere, de qua sequitur, ex significatione `bovis' 
quod sit affectio mali in naturali, ita malum ibi, de qua supra n. 9065, et ex significatione `asini' quod sit verum in naturali, de qua n. 2781, 5492, 5741, 7024, 8078.  Quod `cadere in foveam' cum 
dicitur de bono et vero in naturali, quae significantur per `bovem et asinum,' sit pervertere, patet ex illis quae in versu sequente {2} continentur, ibi enim agitur de emendatione per verum, quod fieri 
potest cum bonis et veris perversis, non autem cum illis exstinctis; nam cum bonum aut verum pervertitur usque manet, sed perverse explicatum {3}; `cadere' etiam est labi per errorem. 	[2] Quia hoc 
significatum est per `cadere in foveam,' ideo dictum est a Domino, 	Cujus vestrum asinus aut bos in puteum cadit, quem non statim extrahitis in die sabbati? Luc. xiv 5; </p>
<p>hoc dictum est a Domino cum 
hydropicum (o)in die sabbati sanavit; dies sabbati erat sanctissimus in illa Ecclesia quia significabat conjugium caeleste, quod est conjunctio boni et veri (c)ex Domino, n. 8495, 8510; inde sanationes 
a Domino fiebant in die sabbati, nam sanatio involvebat sanationem vitae spiritualis, et morbus hydropicus veri (o)et boni perversionem, ita sanatio veri perversi {4} emendationem et restitutionem; 
nam omnia miracula Domini involvebant et significabant status Ecclesiae, n. (x)8364, quemadmodum in genere omnia miracula Divina, n. 7337; inde nunc est quod a Domino dictum, `Cujus vestrum asinus aut 
bos in puteum cadit, quem non statim extrahitis in die sabbati?' per quae in sensu spirituali id quod dictum est {5} significabatur; nam quicquid Dominus locutus est, ex Divino locutus est, et cum ex 
Divino, singulis sensus internus inest, n. 9049, 9063 (o)fin.; per `puteum' ibi simile significatur quod per foveam, nempe falsum, n. 1688.  Et quia `fovea' est falsum, ideo quoque' Dominus cum de falsis 
Ecclesiae locutus est, dixit, 	Quando caecus caecum ducit, ambo in foveam cadunt, Matth. xv 14; </p>
<p>`caecus' est qui in erroneis, `cadere in foveam' est pervertere verum {6}; haec comparative dicta 
sunt, sed omnes comparationes (o)in Verbo ex significativis sumptae {7} sunt, n. (x)3579, 8989. 	[3] Qui credunt quod sanctum Divinum quod in Verbo, non altius reconditum lateat quam in sensu qui apparet 
in littera, is in his et in reliquis Verbi non aliunde videt sanctum quam ex fide quod omnia (o)quae ibi Divinitus inspirata sint {8}; et quod {9} inexplicabilia ibi sint arcana soli Deo {10} nota, 
at qui in hac fide non sunt Verbum contemnunt, solum ob stilum ad apparentiam magis humilem, quam est stilus qui ad genium mundi applicatus est, qualis est apud plures scriptores antiquos et hodiernos; 
at {11} sciant quod sanctum Divinum lateat in omnibus et singulis Verbi, sed consistat in eo quod omnia et singula agant {12} de Domino, de (t)Ipsius regno et {13} Ecclesia; haec sanctissima sunt, 
quia sunt Divina a Domino, in quibus sic (o)est vita aeterna secundum Domini verba apud Johannem, 	Verba quae Ego loquor vobis, spiritus sunt et vita sunt, vi (x)63; </p>
<p>sed sanctissima illa Divina 
patent coram angelis in caelo, quia hi non capiunt Verbum naturaliter secundum sensum litteralem sed spiritualiter secundum sensum internum; secundum hunc sensum etiam homines caperent Verbum si angelicam 
vitam viverent, nempe vitam fidei et amoris; quae in sensu interno Verbi continentur nec aliud sunt quam quae genuina doctrina Ecclesiae docet; genuina doctrina Ecclesiae docet Dominum, fidem in 
Ipsum, amorem in Ipsum, et amorem boni quod ab Ipso; hic amor est charitas erga proximum, n. 6709, 6710, 8123; qui hanc vitam vivunt illustrantur a Domino et vident sancta Verbi, et nullatenus alii; videatur
