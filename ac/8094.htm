<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8094节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8094.</strong>“虽然那里近”表虽然它首先出现。这从“近”的含义清楚可知，当论及分离之信时，“近”是指它首先出现。有必要简单解释一下当如何理解关于分离之信或唯信首先出现这个观点。生活的邪恶伴随着它自己的虚假，这虚假就隐藏在陷入生活邪恶的人里面，有时他意识不到虚假在他里面；不过，一旦他思想教会的真理，尤其当他思想得救时，这虚假就会出现，并清楚显明自己；他若不能否认真理本身，就是真理的一般方面，就会以适合自己邪恶的方式来解释它，从而歪曲它。因此，当他思想信和仁，也就是教会和得救的两个必不可缺的要素时，信立刻出现，但仁不会，因为仁反对生活的邪恶。结果，他也将仁抛到一边，只选择信。由此明显可知，信之真理是“近”的，但信之良善不近；也就是说，首先出现的是前者，而不是后者。<br />许多虚假和错误的观点都是从这个错误和虚假的起点或原则接踵而来的，如：善行丝毫无助于得救；人的生活死后不会跟随他；那时人唯独凭恩典通过信得救，无论他在世上过着怎样的生活；最坏的罪犯也能在生命的最后一刻凭信得救；邪恶能在一瞬间被抹除。这些和其它类似观念就是进入人的思维，并通过这虚假的起点或原则所确立的观念；它们以一个连续的链条从它延伸。但是，如果仁和生活是起点或第一个原则，那么看待这些观念的方式就会完全不同。</p>

Because that was near. That this signifies that it first comes up, is evident from the signification of "near," when said of faith separate, as being that it first comes up. How it is to be understood 
that the opinion concerning faith separate or alone first comes up, shall be briefly told. Evil of life is attended with its own falsity, which falsity lies hidden in the man who is in evil of life, 
and sometimes he is not aware that it is in him; but as soon as he thinks about the truths of the church, and especially when he thinks about salvation, then this falsity comes forth and clearly shows 
itself, and if it cannot deny the truth itself in respect to its general statement, it explains it in favor of its own evil, and thus falsifies it; consequently, when he is thinking about faith and 
charity, which are the essentials of the church and of salvation, faith at once comes up, but not charity, because charity is opposite to evil of life; and therefore he also sets charity aside, and chooses 
faith alone. From all this it is evident that the truths of faith are near, but not the goods of faith; that is, that the former come up first, and not the latter.  [2] From this erroneous and 
false principle afterward follow many false and erroneous notions; as that good works effect nothing for salvation; that a man's life does not follow him after death; that man is then saved by mercy alone 
through faith, howsoever he has lived in the world; that the most wicked is saved by faith in the last hour of his life; that evils are wiped away in a moment. These and the like things are thought 
out and established from this principle, and are consequently so many links in a chain. But they would be perceived to be utterly different if charity and life were the first principle. </p>

'Although that was near' means that this is the first to present itself. This is clear from the meaning of 'being near', when said in reference to separated faith, as the fact that it is the first to 
present itself. A brief statement needs to be made about how one should understand this explanation, that the particular belief regarding separated faith or faith alone is the first to present itself. 
Evil in life is accompanied by its own falsity, and a person subject to evil in life has this falsity hidden away inside himself. Sometimes he does not even know that it is there. But the moment he 
thinks about the Church's truths, and in particular about salvation, that falsity emerges and reveals itself; and if he is unable to deny the truth itself, the general aspects of it, he explains it in 
a way to suit his evil, and in so doing falsifies it. When therefore he thinks about faith and charity, which are the indispensable elements of the Church and of salvation, faith instantly presents itself, 
but not charity since this is opposed to evil in life. As a consequence too he sets aside charity and gives preference to faith alone. From this it is evident that the truths of faith are 'near', 
but not forms of the good of faith; that is, those truths are the first to present themselves, but not these forms of good. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 From this incorrect and false starting-point many more ideas that 
are false and incorrect then follow, such as the ideas that good works contribute nothing to salvation; that a person's life does not follow him after death; that a person is then saved by mercy alone 
through faith, irrespective of the life he has been leading in the world; that the worst criminal is saved through faith in the final hour of his life; and that evils are wiped away in an instant. These 
and others like them are the ideas that enter human thought and establish themselves from that false starting-point; they extend from it in a continuous chain. But the way in which these ideas are 
seen would be altogether different if charity and life were the starting-point. </p>

`Quia propinqua illa': quod significet quod primum obveniat, constat ex significatione `propinquae' cum dicitur de fide separata, quod sit quod primum obveniat.  Quomodo intelligendum quod opinio de 
fide separata seu sola primum obveniat, paucis dicetur: malum vitae secum habet suum falsum; id falsum reconditum jacet apud hominem qui in malo vitae est, {1}et ille quandoque nescit quod {2}id apud 
illum sit; sed ut primum cogitat de Ecclesiae veris, ac imprimis cum {3} de salute, tunc falsum illud prodit et se manifestat, sique ipsum verum quoad commune suum non negare potest, tunc explicat illud 
ad favorem mali sui, ac sic falsificat; cum itaque cogitat de fide et {4} charitate, quae essentialia Ecclesiae et salutis sunt, ilico tunc obvenit fides, non autem charitas, quia haec opposita est 
malo vitae; inde quoque removet charitatem et solam fidem {5}eligit; ex his patet quod fidei vera propinqua sint, non autem fidei bona, hoc est, quod illa primum obveniant, non autem {6}haec. 	2 (c)Ab 
erroneo et falso hoc principio dein consequuntur plura quae falsa {7}et erronea sunt; sicut quod bona opera nihil ad salutem faciant: quod vita non sequatur hominem post mortem': quod tunc salvetur 
homo ex sola misericordia per fidem, utcumque in mundo vixerat: quod scelestissimus salvetur per fidem in ultima vitae suae hora: quod mala abstergantur momento; haec et similia cogitantur et statuuntur 
ex principio illo, sunt inde in catenae nexu; sed illa perciperentur {8}prorsus aliter se habere, si charitas et vita sit principium. 	@1 nam adhaeret malo$ 	@2 in falsis illis$ 	@3 i cogitat$ 	@4
