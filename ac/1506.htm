<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1506节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1506.</strong>为让人们了解气场的性质，我引用以下经历。有一个灵人在世时我就认识他，还与他交谈过。后来，他多次出现在恶灵当中。这是因为他自视甚高，并且获得了一种优于他人的气场。由于他的这种秉性，灵人们突然逃离，以致一个也看不到，只剩下他自己。那时，他充满周围整个气场，这是一种关注自我的气场。很快，他因失去同伴而陷入另一种状态；在来世，凡失去其同伴社群的，可以说先是变得半死不活，因为那时，他的生命仅靠天堂向其内层的流注维持。然后，他开始悲叹，感到痛苦。后来，其他灵人说，他们无法忍受他的临在，因为他渴望比别人更伟大。他最终与别人联合，被抬到高处。他从那里感觉唯独他统治整个宇宙；我欲若放任自流，就会膨胀到这种地步。于是，他被投到地狱灵中。这就是等待那些自认为比别人伟大之人的命运。我欲比其它爱更违背相爱，也就是天堂的生命。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1506.</strong> Let me relate several experiences illustrating the nature of auras.<br />A certain spirit I had known and talked to when he lived in his body later appeared many times in the company of evil spirits. Because he had a high opinion of himself, he had developed an air of superiority to others. And because he was like this, the other spirits suddenly fled, so that none but he could be seen. He then filled up his whole environment in all directions, and the atmosphere was one of concentration on himself. Soon afterward, abandoned by fellow members of his own community as well, he sank into another state. (Those in the other life who are deserted by the community in which they live seem to become half dead at first. At that point, the only thing that keeps them alive is the influence of heaven on their inward capacities.) Then he began to complain and to suffer.<br />Other spirits later told me that they could not stand to have him near, because he considered himself more important than anyone else. Eventually, having formed ties with a new community, he rose high up and consequently seemed to himself to be governing the universe all alone. (Those are the lengths to which self-love inflates our pride when left to itself.) Afterward he was thrown down among hellish spirits. Such is the lot that awaits those who consider themselves greater than others. More than any other love, self-love is opposed to mutual love, which is the life of heaven. </p>

In order that the nature of spheres may be known, I may adduce some things from experience. A certain spirit who had been known to me and with whom I had conversed while he lived in the body, appeared 
many times afterwards among the evil; and as he had a high opinion of himself, he had acquired a sphere of preeminent excellence, because of which the spirits suddenly fled away, so that none appeared 
but himself alone; and he filled the whole surrounding sphere, which was one of self-regard. Being deprived of companions, he presently fell into another state; for in the other life one who is deprived 
of the society in which he is, at first becomes as if he were half dead, for his life is then supported solely by the influx of heaven into his interiors. He then began to lament and feel torment. 
The other spirits afterwards said that they could not endure his presence, because he desired to be greater than others. Being at last brought into association with others, he was carried up on high, 
so that it seemed to him that he alone governed the universe; to such a degree does the love of self puff itself up when left to itself. He was then cast down among the infernals. Such a lot awaits 
those who think themselves greater than others. More than any other love is the love of self contrary to mutual love, which is the life of heaven. </p>

So that the nature of spheres may be known, let some things from experience be cited. A certain spirit whom I had known and spoken to during his lifetime afterwards appeared many times among the evil. 
This was because he had a high opinion of himself and had acquired a sphere of superiority over others. Because he was like this the spirits began suddenly to flee from there so that none was to be 
seen except him alone. At that time he was filling the entire sphere round about, which was a sphere of self-regard. Shortly after, when deprived of his companions, he sank into another state; for in 
the next life anyone who is deprived of the society of his fellows becomes at first so to speak half dead. His life is then maintained solely by the influx of heaven into his interiors. At that point 
this spirit whom I had known started to groan and to suffer torment. I was told afterwards by other spirits that since he wished to be greater than others, they could not tolerate his presence. At length 
he was joined by others and was taken on to a height, and from this position it seemed to him that he alone governed the universe; for so far does self-love puff itself up when left to itself. Finally 
he was cast down among those in hell. Such is the fate awaiting those who imagine that they are greater than others. More than every other kind of love self-love is contrary to mutual love, which 
constitutes the life of heaven. </p>

</p><b>1506.</b>
Ut sciatur quales sphaerae sunt, aliqua ab experientia licet afferre. Quidam spiritus qui dum vixit in corpore, mihi notus fuit, et cum eo locutus, postea multoties apparuit inter malos, is quia multam 
de se opinionem habuit, sphaeram excellentiae prae aliis sibi comparavit; et quia talis, subito aufugiebant spiritus, sic ut nullus appareret quam is solus, qui tunc implebat totam sphaeram circumcirca, 
quae fuit intuitiva sui; mox destitutus quoque a sociis in alium statum lapsus est; qui enim a societate sua in qua est, destituitur in altera vita, fit primum sicut semimortuus; vita modo ejus 
tunc sustinetur ab influxu caeli in interiora ejus; tunc lamentari coepit, et cruciari: dictum postea ab aliis spiritibus quod praesentiam ejus, quia aliis major esse vellet, sufferre non potuerint; 
tandem associatus aliis evectus in altum, et sic visus sibi quod solus gubernaret universum, nam in tantum amor sui insufflat cum relinquitur sibi; dein conjectus est inter infernales; talis sors manet 
illos qui se majores aliis esse putant; amor sui prae omni alio amore contrarius est amori mutuo, qui est vita caeli. </p>
