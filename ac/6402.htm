<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6402节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6402.</strong>“耶和华啊，我等候你的救恩”表除非主给他们带来帮助。这从“等候救恩”的含义清楚可知，“等候救恩”在此是指带来帮助。“耶和华”是指主（参看<a href="1343.htm">1343</a>，<a href="1736.htm">1736</a>，<a href="2156.htm">2156</a>，<a href="2329.htm">2329</a>，<a href="2447.htm">2447</a>，<a href="2921.htm">2921</a>，<a href="3023.htm">3023</a>，<a href="3035.htm">3035</a>，<a href="5663.htm">5663</a>，<a href="6303.htm">6303</a>节）。至于当那些处于真理，尚未被良善引导的人远离真理时，主给他们所带来的帮助，这一切由“使骑马的向后坠落。耶和华啊，我等候你的救恩”来表示，要知道，他们向下、向外看，因为他们尚未处于良善；而那些处于良善的人，如重生之人，则向上、向内看；因为当人正在重生时，秩序便在这个过程中被扭转过来。<br />那些处于真理，尚未处于良善的人因向下、向外看，故在那些属于大人表皮区域的人当中；因为表皮朝下，远离身体的内在部位，并从在它之外的东西中获得自己的触觉，而不是从里面的东西获得感觉。由此明显可知，这些人在主的国度中，因为他们在大人里面，尽管在它的最末和最外在部分。关于构成皮肤的那些人，可参看前文（<a href="5552.htm">5552</a>-<a href="5559.htm">5559</a>节）。</p>

I wait for Thy salvation, O Jehovah. That this signifies unless the Lord brings aid, is evident from the signification of "waiting for salvation," as here being to bring aid. (That "Jehovah" is the Lord 
may be seen above, n. 1343, 1736, 2156, 2329, 2447, 2921, 3023, 3035, 5663, 6303.) In regard to the aid which the Lord brings when they recede who are in truth and not yet led by good, which is signified 
by "the rider shall fall backward, I wait for Thy salvation O Jehovah," be it known that they look downward or outward, for they are not yet in good; whereas they who are in good, as are the regenerate, 
look upward or inward; for when man is being regenerated, the order is changed in this way. As they who are in truth and not yet in good look downward or outward, therefore also they are among 
those who belong to the province of the outer skin in the Grand Man; for the outer skin is turned outward from the interiors of the body, and gets its sense of touch from what is without, but not 
sensibly from what is within. Hence it is plain that these persons are in the Lord's kingdom, because in the Grand Man, but in its ultimates. (As to those who constitute the skin, see above, n. 5552-5559.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6402</b></p><p><b>6402.</b>
'I Wait for Your salvation, O Jehovah' means unless the Lord brings them aid. This is clear from the meaning here of 'waiting for salvation' as bringing aid, 'Jehovah' being the Lord, see <a href="1343.htm">1343</a>, <a href="1736.htm">1736</a>, <a href="2156.htm">2156</a>, <a href="2329.htm">2329</a>, <a href="2447.htm">2447</a>, <a href="2921.htm">2921</a>, <a href="3023.htm">3023</a>, <a href="3035.htm">3035</a>, <a href="5663.htm">5663</a>, <a href="6303.htm">6303</a>. As regards the aid that the Lord brings to those who are guided by truth but not as yet by good when they recede from truth - meant by 'the rider will 
fall backwards; I wait for Your salvation, O Jehovah' - it should be recognized that they are people who look downwards and outwards since they are not as yet guided by good. But those who are guided 
by good, as those who have been regenerated are, are ones who look upwards and inwards; for when a person is being regenerated order is turned around in the process. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Since those who are guided 
by truth but not as yet by good look downwards and outwards they are also some of those who in the Grand Man belong to the province of the outward skin; for the outward skin looks outwards, away from 
the internal parts of the body, and the sense of touch is aroused by things on the outside of it. No such feeling is aroused from the inside. From this it is evident that these people are in the Lord's 
kingdom, since they are in the Grand Man, though in its last and outermost parts. Regarding those who constitute the skin, see <a href="5552.htm">5552</a>-<a href="5559.htm">5559</a>. </p>

`Salutem Tuam exspecto Jehovah': quod significet nisi Dominus opem ferat, constat ex significatione `salutem exspectare' quod hic sit opem {1}ferre; quod Jehovah sit Dominus, videatur n. 1343, 1736, 
2156, 2329, (x)2447, 2922, 3023, 3035, 5663, 6303.  Quod opem attinet, quam Dominus fert quando qui in vero sunt et non adhuc bonum ducit, recedunt, quae significantur per `cadet eques retrorsum, salutem 
Tuam exspecto Jehovah', sciendum quod illi spectent deorsum seu extrorsum, nam nondum in bono sunt; qui autem in bono sunt, ut sunt {2}regenerati, spectant sursum seu introrsum, nam cum regeneratur 
homo, vertitur ita ordo.  [2] Quia illi qui in vero sunt et nondum in bono, spectant deorsum {3}seu extrorsum, ideo etiam inter illos sunt qui ad provinciam cutis externae in Maximo Homine pertinent, 
nam cutis externa ab interioribus corporis vertitur extrorsum,et ab illis (x)quae extra sunt, sensum tactus sui capit, non autem sensibiliter ab illis quae intra; inde patet quod in regno Domini sint, 
quia etiam in Maximo Homine sed in ultimis ejus; de illis qui cutem constituunt, videatur n. 5552-5559. @1 , de qua sequitur$ @2 illi qui regenerati sunt$ @3 aut$ </p>
