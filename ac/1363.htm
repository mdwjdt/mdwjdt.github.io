<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1363.</strong>“亚伯兰、拿鹤、哈兰”是他拉的儿子，也是以他们命名并作为祖先的民族。这些儿子在此表各种偶像崇拜。这从前面，以及这一事实清楚可知，即“他拉”表偶像崇拜，他们就是他的儿子。不过，若认真检查偶像崇拜的类型，就能看出他拉的这三个儿子，以及后来哈兰的儿子罗得在此表哪种形式的偶像崇拜。偶像崇拜一般有四种类型，一个比一个内在。这三种更内在的类型就象同出一父母的儿子，而第四种则象第三种的儿子。偶像崇拜有内在形式和外在形式之分。内在形式是指那些定人罪的形式，外在形式则没那么严重。偶像崇拜的形式越内在，它所定的罪就越重；越外在，则所定的罪越没那么重。内在偶像崇拜者不承认神，只崇拜他们自己和这个世界，视其一切欲望为偶像。然而，外在偶像崇拜者能承认神，即便他们并不清楚谁是宇宙之神。内在偶像崇拜者通过他们所获得的生活就能被认出；这种生活背离仁爱的生活到何种程度，他们就是何种程度的内在偶像崇拜者。外在偶像崇拜者仅从他们的敬拜就能被认出，尽管他们是偶像崇拜者，但他们仍拥有仁爱的生活。内在偶像崇拜者能亵渎圣物，而外在偶像崇拜者则不能；因此外在的偶像崇拜是可容忍的，以免亵渎圣物，这从前面的说明（<a href="571.htm">571</a>，<a href="582.htm">582</a>节；<a href="1327.htm">1327</a>节中第9节）清楚可知。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1363.</strong> Abram, Nahor, and Haran were sons of Terah, and they were also nations named after those men as their forefathers; here they symbolize idolatrous forms of worship. This can be seen from evidence offered above [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1363/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1358" target=_top>1358</a>] and also from the fact that Terah (whose children they were) symbolizes idolatry.<br />Just what types of idolatrous cult are symbolized here by Terah's three sons and later by Lot (Haran's son) can be determined by examining the different kinds of idolatrous cults. There are four kinds in general, each one deeper than the next. The three deeper levels are like the children of one parent; the fourth is like a child of the third.<br />There are inward and outward types of idolatrous worship. The inward types are those that damn us, while the outward types do not. The deeper a form of idolatrous worship goes, the more it condemns us; the shallower it is, the less it condemns us.<br />[2] Inward idolaters do not acknowledge God but adulate themselves and the world; all their cravings serve as their idols. Outward idolaters, however, can acknowledge God, even though they do not know who the God of the universe is.<br />Internal idolaters are recognized by the life they have acquired for themselves; the further their life diverges from a life of charity, the deeper their idolatry goes. External idolaters are recognized only by their worship; even though they are idolaters, they can still live a life of charity.<br />Inward idolaters are capable of profaning holy things, but outward idolaters are not. Outward idolatry is tolerated, then, to keep people from profaning holy things, as indicated by earlier remarks, at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1363/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_571" target=_top>571</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1363/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_582" target=_top>582</a>, and above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1363/bible_king-james-version_genesis_11_9" target=_top>9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1363/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1327" target=_top>1327</a>. </p>

That Abram, Nahor, and Haran were sons of Terah, and that they were also nations named from them as their fathers, and that by them idolatrous worships are here signified, is evident from the explanations 
given above; and also from the fact that idolatry is signified by Terah, whose sons they were. But what idolatrous worships are here signified by the three sons of Terah, and afterwards by Lot the 
son of Haran, may be seen if idolatrous worships are examined according to their kinds. There are in general four idolatrous worships, one more interior than another. The three more interior ones are 
as the sons of one parent; the fourth is as the son of the third. Idolatrous worships are internal and external; the internal are those which condemn man; the external not so much. The more interior 
the idolatrous worship is, the more it condemns; but the more exterior, the less. Internal idolaters do not acknowledge God, but adore themselves and the world, and make idols of all their cupidities; 
whereas external idolaters are able to acknowledge God, although they do not know who is the God of the universe. Internal idolaters are known from the life they have acquired; and in proportion as 
this life departs from the life of charity, in the same proportion are they more interior idolaters. External idolaters are known solely from their worship; and, although idolaters, they can still have 
the life of charity. Internal idolaters can profane holy things, but external idolaters cannot; and therefore external idolatry is tolerated, in order to prevent the profanation of holy things; as 
may be seen from what has been said before (n. 571, 582; and at verse 9, n. 1327). </p>

That 'Abram, Nahor, and Haran' were the sons of Terah and also nations that were named after them as their forefathers, and that here these sons mean forms of idolatrous worship, is clear from what has 
been shown above and also from the fact that 'Terah', whose sons they were, means idolatry. Which forms of idolatrous worship however are meant here by the three sons of Terah and after that by Lot, 
the son of Haran, becomes clear if the categories of idolatrous worship are examined. There are in general four kinds of idolatrous worship, one more interior than the next. The three more interior 
types are like sons of the same parent, while the fourth is like the son of the third of these. There are internal and external forms of idolatrous worship. Internal forms are those which condemn a person, 
external less so. The more interior a form of idolatrous worship is, the more it condemns, while the more exterior it is, the less it does so. Internal idolaters do not acknowledge God but venerate 
themselves and the world, and treat all their desires as idols. External idolaters however are able to acknowledge God even though they are not aware of who the God of the universe is. Internal idolaters 
are known by the life they have acquired for themselves; and to the extent that their life is a departure from the life of charity they are interior idolaters. External idolaters are so solely 
on account of their worship, and although they are indeed idolaters they are nevertheless able to have the life of charity within them. Internal idolaters are capable of profaning holy things, whereas 
external idolaters are not. Consequently to guard against the profaning of holy things, external idolatry is permitted, as may become clear from what has been stated already in <a href="571.htm">571</a>, <a href="582.htm">582</a>, and above at 
verse 9, in <a href="1327.htm">1327</a>. </p>

Quod 'Abram, Nahor et Haran' fuerint filii Terahi et quod quoque gentes ab illis ut a suis patribus nominatae et quod per illos hic significentur cultus idololatrici, constat ab illis quae supra ostensa 
sunt, tum quoque ex eo quod per 'Terahum' cujus filii fuerunt, significetur idololatria: sed quinam cultus idololatrici per tres Terahi filios, et dein per Lotum, filium Haranis, hic significentur, 
constare potest ex cultibus idololatricis, si inspiciuntur secundum genera.  Sunt cultus idololatrici in genere quatuor, unus interior altero; tres interiores sunt sicut filii unius parentis, quartus 
est sicut filius tertii.  Sunt cultus idololatrici interni et externi; interni sunt qui condemnant hominem, externi autem non ita; quo cultus idololatricus interior est, eo magis condemnat, at quo 
exterior, eo minus:  interni idololatrae non agnoscunt Deum, sed adorant se et mundum, et pro idolis habent omnes cupiditates; at externi possunt agnoscere Deum, tametsi ignorant quis Deus universi:  
interni idololatrae cognoscuntur a vita quam sibi acquisiverunt, quae vita quantum recedit a vita charitatis tantum interiores idololatrae sunt; externi idololatrae solum ex cultu qui tametsi idololatrae 
sunt, usque vitam charitatis possunt habere:  interni idololatrae possunt profanare sancta, at externi idololatrae non possunt; quare ne profanentur sancta, toleratur idololatria externa, sicut constare 
potest ab illis quae dicta prius n. 571, 582, et supra ad vers. 9, n. 1327. </p>
