<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8410节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8410.</strong>“吃饼得饱”表在这种情况下，他们可以尽情享受低级趣味的良善。这从“吃”、“饼”和“得饱”的含义清楚可知。“吃”是指变成人自己的（参看<a href="3168.htm">3168</a>，<a href="3513.htm">3513</a>e，<a href="3596.htm">3596</a>，<a href="4745.htm">4745</a>节），也指享受（<a href="7849.htm">7849</a>节）。“饼”是指天上生活的良善，在反面意义上是指脱离天上生活的属世生活的良善，因而是低级趣味的良善；因为“饼”在灵义上表示滋养灵魂并维持其属灵生命的首要事物，这首要事物就是爱之良善，这一点从天堂的生活明显看出来，天堂的生活唯独由这良善构成；但在反面意义上，“饼”表示滋养地狱里的人并维持其生命的首要事物，这首要事物就是自我之爱和尘世之爱的邪恶，这一点从地狱的生活明显看出来，地狱的生活唯独由这邪恶构成；对他们来说，邪恶就是良善，因为没有比这更让他们快乐、甜蜜的了；此处“低级趣味的良善”就表示这一点。“得饱”是指尽情，因为对善人来说，意愿吃良善得饱；对恶人来说，意愿吃邪恶得饱。</p>

When we did eat bread to satiety. That this signifies that thus they had enjoyed the good of pleasures as much as they wished, is evident from the signification of "eating," as being appropriation (see 
n. 3168, 3513, 3596, 4745), and also enjoyment (n. 7849); and from the signification of "bread," as being the good of heavenly life, and in the opposite sense the good of natural life separate from 
heavenly life, thus the good of pleasures. For by "bread" in the spiritual sense is meant the primary thing that nourishes the soul and preserves its spiritual life. That this is the good of love, is 
evident from the life of heaven, which consists solely of this good. But in the opposite sense by "bread" is meant the primary thing that nourishes those who are in hell, and sustains their life. That 
this is the evil of the love of self and of the world, is evident from the life of hell, which consists solely in this. Evil is to them good, for nothing is more delightful and sweet to them. This is 
here meant by "the good of pleasures." And from the signification of "to satiety," as being as much as they wished (or willed), for with the good it is the will that is sated with good, and with the 
evil it is the will that is sated with evil. </p>

'Eating bread to the full!' means that in that situation they enjoyed the good of lower pleasures, as much as they wished to have. This is clear from the meaning of 'eating' as making one's own, dealt 
with in <a href="3168.htm">3168</a>, <a href="3513.htm">3513</a> (end), <a href="3596.htm">3596</a>, <a href="4745.htm">4745</a>, and also as enjoyment, <a href="7849.htm">7849</a>; from the meaning of 'bread' as the good of heavenly life, and in the contrary sense the good of natural life separated from heavenly, 
thus the good of lower pleasures (in the spiritual sense 'bread' means the chief thing that nourishes the soul and maintains its spiritual life, that chief thing being the good of dove, as heaven's 
life demonstrates, which consists wholly of that good. But in the contrary sense 'bread' is used to mean the chief thing that nourishes those in hell and sustains their life, that chief thing being the 
evil of self-love and love of the world, as hell's life demonstrates, which consists wholly in that evil. To those in hell that evil is good, for to them nothing is more delightful or sweeter; and 
it is this that is meant here by the good of lower pleasures); and from the meaning of 'to the full' as, as much as they wished to have, since the will is what is filled with good if people are good, 
or with evil if they are evil. </p>

`In edendo nos panem ad satietatem': quod significet quod sic bono voluptatum fruerentur quantum vellent, constat ex significatione `edere' quod sit appropriatio, de qua n. 3168, 3513 fin., 3596, 4745, 
et quoque fruitio, n. 7849; ex significatione `panis' quod sit bonum vitae caelestis, et in opposito sensu bonum vitae naturalis (x)separatae a caelesti, ita bonum voluptatum; per `panem' enim in 
sensu spirituali intelligitur primarium quod nutrit animam, ac spiritualem ejus vitam conservat; quod hoc sit bonum amoris, constat a vita caeli, quae unice ex illo bono consistit; at in opposito sensu 
per `panem' intelligitur primarium quod nutrit illos qui in inferno, ac illorum vitam sustentat; quod hoc sit malum amoris sui et mundi, constat a vita inferni, quae unice {1}in illo consistit; id malum 
est illis {2} bonum, nam nihil illis jucundius et dulcius {3}; hoc intelligitur hic per bonum voluptatum; et ex significatione `ad satietatem' quod sit quantum vellent, nam voluntas est quae satiatur 
bono apud bonos, et malo apud malos. 	@1 ex$ 	@2 i ibi$ 	@3 i est$ </p>
