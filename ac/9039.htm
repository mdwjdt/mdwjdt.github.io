<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9039节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9039.</strong>“因为那奴仆就等于他的银子”表从自我所获得的东西。这从“银子”的含义清楚可知，“银子”是指真理（参看<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="2954.htm">2954</a>，<a href="5658.htm">5658</a>，<a href="6112.htm">6112</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>，<a href="6917.htm">6917</a>节），在此是指自我所获得的真理，因为它论及被买来的奴仆。“自我所获得的真理”描述了一个人信以为真理的东西，哪怕它不是真理，因为他是从自我先入为主的观念中得到它的。对那些未经天堂之光光照就解释圣言，也就是虽阅读圣言，却没有为了生活良善的缘故而对真理的任何情感之人来说，这就是真理的样子，因为这些人没有被光照。如果在经过充分思考之后，这个真理被消灭，那么就没有死亡的惩罚，也就是没有诅咒了，因为它不是一个属灵的神性真理。不过，如果它在充分思考之前被消灭，那么就会有诅咒，因为这是对信之真理本身的一个抛弃。凡成为任何人信仰的一部分的东西，即便它不是真理，也不可未经充分思考就被抛弃。如果在此之前它被抛弃，那么人的属灵生命的柔嫩开端就会被连根拔除。因此，主从不破碎与一个人同在的这种真理，而是尽可能地把它弯过来。<br />举例说明这一点。以一个以为天上的荣耀，因而喜乐在于统治许多人，并用所设想的这个观念来解释主的话，即：那赚了十弥拿和五弥拿的仆人将有权柄管十座城、五座城（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路19.11.htm">19:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路19.26.htm">26</a>），又用来解释主对门徒所说的话，即：他们要坐在宝座上审判以色列的十二支派（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.30.htm">22:30</a>）之人为例。这个人若未经充分思考就消灭了他的信仰，也就是他从圣言字义所获得的对真理的信仰，就会导致属灵生命的丧失。但是，他若经过充分思考之后用其它话来解释主的话，即用主的这些话：“谁愿为最大，就必作最小的”，“谁愿为首，就必作所有人的仆人”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.26.htm">20:26</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.28.htm">28</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.42.htm">10:42</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.45.htm">45</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.24.htm">22:24</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.27.htm">27</a>），然后若放弃了他的信仰，即天上的荣耀和喜乐在于统治许多人，那么就不会导致其属灵生命的丧失。因为那些赚了约拿的人有权柄所管的“城”表示信之真理（<a href="2268.htm">2268</a>，<a href="2449.htm">2449</a>，<a href="2712.htm">2712</a>，<a href="2943.htm">2943</a>，<a href="3216.htm">3216</a>节），以及由此而来的聪明和智慧；门徒所要坐的“宝座”所表相同（<a href="2129.htm">2129</a>，<a href="6937.htm">6937</a>节）。<br />在天上，那些凭信之真理而在聪明和智慧上超过其他人的人还如此地谦卑，以致他们将其全部能力都归于主，无一归于自己。因此，他们在统治中根本找不到任何荣耀或喜乐，只在服务中才能找到。当处于这种状态时，他们就在统治权，以及荣耀和喜乐上超过其他人；然而，他们如此行不是因为想要统治，如前所述，而是出于爱与仁的情感，也就是服务他人的一种渴望。事实上，主以能力流入那些谦卑的人，不会流入那些高傲自大的人，因为前者接受流注，而后者则弃绝它（<a href="7489.htm">7489</a>-<a href="7492.htm">7492</a>节）。</p>

Because he is his silver. That this signifies what is acquired from one's own, is evident from the signification of "silver," as being truth (see n. 1551, 2954, 5658, 6112, 6914, 6917), here, as a bought 
slave is treated of, it denotes truth acquired by one's own. That is called "truth acquired by one's own" which by induction from principles conceived from one's own is believed to be truth, and 
yet is not truth. Such is the truth with those who explain the Word without being enlightened by the light of heaven; that is, who read it not with any affection of truth for the sake of the good of life; 
for these are not enlightened. If after a full view this truth is extinguished, there is no punishment of death, that is, damnation, because it is not Divine spiritual truth; but if it is extinguished 
before a full view, there is damnation, because there is a rejection of the truth of faith itself. For that which has been made of anyone's faith, even if it is not true, ought not to be rejected, 
except after taking a full view; if it is rejected sooner, the first beginning of the man's spiritual life is plucked up by the roots; and therefore the Lord never breaks such truth with a man, but 
as far as possible bends it. Let an example serve for illustration. [2] He who believes that the glory and therefore the joy of heaven consist in ruling over many, and from this conceived principle 
explains the Lord's words concerning the servants who gained ten pounds and five pounds, that they should have power over ten cities and over five cities (Luke 19:11); and also the Lord's words to the 
disciples, that they should sit upon thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel (Luke 22:30); if before taking a full view he extinguishes his faith, which is a faith of truth from the literal sense 
of the Word, he occasions the loss of his spiritual life. But if after taking a full view, he interprets these words of the Lord from His other words that "whosoever will be greatest must be the least," 
and "whosoever would be the first must be the servant of all" (Matt. 20:26-28; Mark 10:42-45; Luke 22:24-27), if he then extinguishes his faith as regards heavenly glory and joy from rule over many, 
he does not occasion the loss of his spiritual life; for by the "cities" over which those were to have power who gained the pounds are signified the truths of faith (n. 2268, 2449, 2712, 2943, 3216), 
and the derivative intelligence and wisdom; in like manner by the "thrones" upon which the disciples were to sit (n. 2129, 6937). [3] Those in heaven who are preeminently in intelligence and wisdom 
from the truths of faith, are in such humiliation that they attribute everything of power to the Lord, and nothing to themselves; and therefore they do not make anything of glory and joy to consist 
in ruling, but in serving; and when they are in this state, they are in rule, and also in glory and joy, above others; yet not as before said from the love of rule, but from the affection of love and 
charity, which is that of serving others. For the Lord flows with power into those who are humble; but not into those who are puffed up, because the former receive influx, but the latter reject it (n. 
7489-7492). </p>

'Since he is his silver' means that which has been acquired from the self. This is clear from the meaning of 'silver' as truth, dealt with in <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="2954.htm">2954</a>, <a href="5658.htm">5658</a>, <a href="6112.htm">6112</a>, <a href="6914.htm">6914</a>, <a href="6917.htm">6917</a>, at this point truth that 
has been acquired by the self since it refers to a slave who has been bought. The words 'truth that has been acquired by the self' describe that which a person believes to be the truth - even though 
it is not the truth - because he has drawn it from preconceptions adopted by the self. This is what truth is like with those who explain the Word without having been enlightened by the light of heaven, 
that is, who read it without an affection for truth for the sake of goodness of life, since they are unenlightened. If this truth is disposed of after full contemplation of it, there is no punishment 
of death, that is, no damnation, because it is not a spiritual Divine truth. But if it is disposed of before full contemplation, there is damnation, for it is a casting aside of the truth of faith 
itself What has become part of anyone's faith, even though not the truth, must not be cast aside without full contemplation of it. If it is cast aside before this the tender beginnings of spiritual 
life in the person are rooted out. For this reason also the Lord never breaks this kind of truth with a person, but so far as is possible He bends it. </p>

 Let an example serve to shed light on this. 
Take someone who believes that the glory and consequently the joy of heaven consist in domination over many, and who uses this accepted idea to explain the Lord's words which declare that the slaves 
who had earned ten minas and five minas were to have power over ten cities and over five cities, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2019:11-26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 19:11-26</a>, using also the Lord's words to the disciples, that they would sit on thrones and would 
judge the twelve tribes of Israel, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2022:30&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 22:30</a>. If that person disposes of his faith, which is a belief in truth he has acquired from the literal sense of the Word, before full contemplation of it, he 
causes the loss of his spiritual life. But if after full contemplation he uses other words to explain what the Lord said - the Lord's words that whoever has the wish to be the greatest must be the least, 
and whoever has the wish to be the first must be the slave of all, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2020:26-28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 20:26-28</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2010:42-44&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 10:42-44</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2022:24-27%20-&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 22:24-27 -</a> then if he disposes of his belief that heavenly glory and joy come out of having dominion 
over many, he does not cause any loss of his spiritual life For by 'the cities' over which those who had earned the mines were to have power are meant the truths of faith, <a href="2268.htm">2268</a>, <a href="2449.htm">2449</a>, <a href="2712.htm">2712</a>, <a href="2943.htm">2943</a>, <a href="3216.htm">3216</a>, and therefore intelligence and wisdom; and the same things are meant by 'the thrones' on which the disciples were going to sit, <a href="2129.htm">2129</a>, <a href="6397.htm">6397</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Those in heaven who by virtue of the truths 
of faith excel others in intelligence and wisdom are also so humble that they ascribe the whole of their power to the Lord and none whatever to themselves Therefore they find no glory or joy at all in 
dominating, only in serving And when this is their state they excel others in dominion, and also in glory and joy; but they do so not because of any wish to dominate, as has been stated, only because 
of a desire springing from love and charity, which is a desire to serve others For the Lord flows in with power with those who are humble, but not with those who are haughty, because the humble accept 
His influx whereas the haughty reject it, <a href="7489.htm">7489</a>, <a href="7491.htm">7491</a>, <a href="7492.htm">7492</a>. </p>

`Quia argentum ejus ille':  quod significet ex proprio acquisitum, constat ex significatione `argenti' quod sit verum, de qua n. 1551, 2954, 5658, 6112, 6914, 6917, hic quia agitur de servo empto, est 
(d)verum a proprio acquisitum; (d)verum a proprio acquisitum dicitur {1}id quod per inductionem ex captis principiis ex proprio creditur esse verum, et tamen non verum est; tale verum est illis qui 
non illustrati a luce caeli explicant Verbum, hoc est, qui non {2}ex affectione veri {3} propter bonum vitae legunt illud, nam hi non illustrantur; si hoc exstinguitur post intuitionem plenam, non est 
punitio mortis, hoc est, damnatio, quia non est verum spirituale Divinum; at si exstinguitur ante intuitionem plenam, est damnatio, nam est rejectio veri fidei ipsius; quod enim fidei alicujus factum 
est, etiamsi non verum foret, non rejiciendum est nisi per plenam intuitionem; si prius, initiamentum vitae ejus spiritualis exstirpatur; quapropter etiam Dominus nusquam tale verum apud hominem frangit, 
sed quantum 2 fieri potest flectit; {4}sed sit exemplum illustrationi: qui credit caeli gloriam et inde gaudium consistere in dominatu super multos, et ex {5}capto hoc principio explicat Domini 
verba de servis qui lucrati minas decem et quinque, quod potestatem habituri essent super decem urbes et super quinque urbes, Luc. xix 11 -26; ut et ex Domini verbis ad discipulos, quod sessuri essent 
super thronis et judicaturi duodecim tribus Israelis, Luc. xxii 30; si fidem suam, quae est fides veri ex sensu litterali Verbi, ante plenam (x)intuitionem exstinguit, jacturam spiritualis suae vitae 
facit; at si post intuitionem plenam, interpretatur illa ex Domini verbis, quod qui maximus velit esse, erit minimus, et qui primus, erit omnium servus, Matth. xx 26-28; Marc. x 42 [,43, 44]; Luc. xxii 
24-27, tunc si exstinguit fidem suam de gloria et gaudio caelesti ex dominatu super multos, non jacturam vitae suae spiritualis facit; per `urbes' enim `super quibus potestatem habituri sunt qui lucrati 
minas' significantur vera fidei, n. 2268, (x)2449, 2712, 2943, 3216, ac inde intelligentia et sapientia {6}; similiter per `thronos super quibus sessuri discipuli,' n. 2129, 6397; qui in caelo ex 
veris 3 fidei in intelligentia et sapientia prae aliis sunt, illi in tali humiliatione sunt ut omne potestatis tribuant Domino et nihil sibi, quapropter nec aliquid gloriae {7}et gaudii in dominando 
sed in serviendo ponunt; et cum in hoc statu sunt, in dominio sunt, et quoque in gloria et {8} gaudio prae aliis, sed non ex dominatu, ut dictum est, verum ex affectione amoris et charitatis, quae est 
serviendi aliis; influit enim Dominus cum potentia apud illos qui humiles sunt, non autem apud elatos, quia illi influxum recipiunt, hi autem rejiciunt, n. 7489, (x)7491, 7492. @1 i cum de vero scientifico
