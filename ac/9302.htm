Verses 20-30. Behold I send an angel before thee, to guard thee in the way, and to bring thee to the place which I have prepared. Take heed of his face, and hear his voice, lest thou provoke him; for 
he will not endure your transgression, because My name is in the midst of him. For if hearing thou shalt hear his voice, and do all that I speak, I will act as an enemy against thine enemies, and I will 
act as an adversary against thine adversaries. When Mine angel shall go before thee, and shall bring thee unto the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the 
Jebusite; and I shall cut him off; thou shalt not bow down thyself to their gods, and shalt not serve them, and shalt not do after their works; for destroying thou shalt destroy them, and breaking 
shalt break in pieces their statues. And ye shall serve Jehovah your God, and He shall bless thy bread, and thy waters; and I will take away disease from the midst of thee. There shall not be one miscarrying, 
or barren, in thy land; the number of thy days I will fulfill. I will send My terror before thee, and I will trouble all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will give to thee the neck of 
all thine enemies. And I will send the hornet before thee, and it shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee. I will not drive him out from before thee in one year; 
lest perchance the land be desolate, and the wild beast of the field be multiplied upon thee. By little and little I will drive him out from before thee, until thou be fruitful, and inherit the land. "Behold 
I send an angel before thee," signifies the Lord as to the Divine Human; "to guard thee in the way," signifies His providence and guard from the falsities of evil; "and to bring thee to the 
place which I have prepared," signifies introduction by Him into heaven according to the good of life and of faith; "take heed of his face," signifies holy fear; "and hear his voice," signifies obedience 
to the commandments which are from Him; "lest thou provoke him," signifies a turning away from Him through falsities from evil; "for he will not endure your transgression," signifies because these 
are opposed to truths from good; "because My name is in the midst of him," signifies that from Him is all the good of love and truth of faith; "for if hearing thou shalt hear his voice," signifies instruction 
in the commandments of faith, and reception; "and do all that I speak," signifies compliance from faith and love; "I will act as an enemy against thine enemies," signifies that the Lord will 
avert all falsities derived from evil; "and I will act as an adversary against thine adversaries," signifies that He will avert all evils from which are falsities; "when Mine angel shall go before thee," 
signifies a life in accordance with the commandments of the Lord; "and shall bring thee unto the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, and 
I shall cut him off," signifies when the Lord has protected against the evils and falsities which infest the church, and has removed them; "thou shalt not bow down thyself to their gods," signifies that 
falsities of evil are not to be worshiped; "and shalt not serve them," signifies that neither are they to be obeyed; "and shalt not do after their works," signifies that evils of life are not to be 
followed after; "for destroying thou shalt destroy them," signifies that evils must be wholly removed; "and breaking shalt break in pieces their statues," signifies in like manner the falsities of worship; 
"and ye shall serve Jehovah your God," signifies the worship of the Lord alone; "and he shall bless thy bread, and thy waters," signifies the increase of the good of love and truth of faith; "and 
I will take away disease from the midst of thee," signifies protection from falsifications of truth and adulterations of good; "there shall not be one miscarrying, or barren, in thy land," signifies 
that goods and truths will proceed in their order in continual progression; "the number of thy days I will fulfill," signifies even to a full state; "I will send My terror before thee," signifies the 
terror felt by those who are in the evils of falsity on account of the truths of good; "and I will trouble all the people," signifies the dismay of all falsities; "to whom thou shalt come," signifies 
at the presence of the Lord; "and I will give to thee the neck of all thine enemies," signifies the flight and damnation of falsities; "and I will send the hornet before thee," signifies the dread felt 
by those who are in falsities from evil; "and it shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee," signifies the flight of the falsities that are from evils; "I will not 
drive him out from before thee in one year," signifies no hasty flight or removal of them; "lest perchance the land be desolate," signifies a deficiency in that case, and but little spiritual life; 
"and the wild beast of the field be multiplied upon thee," signifies a flowing in of falsities from the delights of the loves of self and of the world; "by little and little I will drive him out from 
before thee," signifies removal by degrees according to order; "until thou be fruitful," signifies according to the increase of good; "and inherit the land," signifies until in good, and thus regenerate. </p>

Verses 20-30 Behold, I send an angel before you to keep you safe on the way, and to bring you to the place which I have prepared. Take notice of his face, and hear his voice, lest you provoke him, for 
he will not bear your transgression; for My name is in the middle of him. For if you indeed hear his voice and do all that I speak, I will act as enemy to your enemies and will act as adversary to your 
adversaries. When My angel goes before you, and brings you to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, and I cut them off, you shall not 
bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do according to their works; for you shall utterly destroy them and completely break to pieces their pillars. And you shall serve Jehovah your God, and He 
will bless your bread and your water. And I will remove sickness from the midst of you. None will suffer miscarriage or be barren<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> in your land; I will fulfill the number of your days. I will send My

against you. Little by little I will drive them out from before you, until you become fruitful and inherit the land.  </p>
<p>'Behold, I send an angel before you' means the Lord's Divine Human. 'To keep you 
safe on the way' means His providence and protection from falsities arising from evil. 'To bring you to the place which I have prepared' means being brought into heaven by Him according to goodness 
of life and of faith. 'Take notice of his face' means holy fear. 'And hear his voice' means obedience to the commandments received from Him. 'Lest you provoke him' means turning away from Him through 
falsities arising from evil. 'For he will not bear your transgression' means because those falsities are repugnant to truths springing from good. 'For My name is in the middle of him' means that from 
Him comes all the good of love and truth of faith. 'For if you indeed hear his voice' means learning and accepting the commandments of faith. 'And do all that I speak' means an obedience springing from 
faith and love. 'I will act as enemy to your enemies' means that the Lord will turn away all falsities arising from evil. 'And will act as adversary to your adversaries' means that He will turn away 
all evils from which falsities arise. 'When My angel goes before you' means a life in keeping with the Lord's commandments. 'And brings you to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the 
Canaanite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, and I cut them off' means when the Lord provides protection against the evils and falsities molesting the Church, and removes them. 'You shall not bow down 
to their gods' means that falsities arising from evil must not be worshipped. 'Nor serve them' means that neither must they be obeyed. 'Nor do according to their works' means that evils of life must 
not be pursued. 'For you shall utterly destroy them' means that evils must be completely removed. 'And completely break to pieces their pillars' means that the same must be done to falsities of worship. 
'And you shall serve Jehovah your God' means worship of the Lord alone. 'And He will bless your bread and your water' means the increase of the good of love and of the truth of faith. 'And I will 
remove sickness from the midst of you' means protection from falsifications of truth and adulterations of good. 'None will suffer miscarriage or be barren in your land' means that forms of good and truths 
will develop in their proper order, in continuous progression. 'I will fulfill the number of your days' means all the way to a state of completeness. 'I will send My terror before you' means the 
terror felt, on account of truths springing from good, by those immersed in evils arising from falsity. 'And throw into confusion all the people' means the dismay of all falsities. 'To whom you come' 
means because of the Lord's presence. 'And I will make all your enemies turn their necks towards you' means the flight of falsities and their damnation. 'And I will send the hornet before you' means 
the dread felt by those who are steeped in falsities arising from evil. 'And it will drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite from before you' means the flight of falsities arising from evils. 
'I will not drive them out from before you in one year' means no hurried flight or removal of them. 'Lest perhaps the land becomes desolate' means a deficiency in that case, and little spiritual 
life. 'And the wild animal of the field multiplies against you' means an inrush of falsities arising from the delights of self-love and love of the world. 'Little by little I will drive them out from 
before you' means a removal effected gradually according to order. 'Until you become fruitful' means in keeping with the increase of good. 'And inherit the land' means when governed by good, thus when 
regenerated.

Vers. 20-30.  Ecce Ego mitto angelum ante te, ad custodiendum te in via, et ad perducendum te ad locum quem praeparavi.  Custodi a facie ejus et audi vocem ejus, ne exacerbes eum, quia non feret praevaricationem
