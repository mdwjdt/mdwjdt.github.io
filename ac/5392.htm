<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5392节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5392.</strong>从与胃有关的人可在某种程度上看出构成大人里面肠这个区域的，究竟是谁。因为肠是胃的延续，胃的功能在肠内增强和加剧，直到肠的末端，即结肠和直肠。因此，后者里面的人靠近被称为排泄物的地狱。在低地的人就在胃和肠这个区域。他们因从尘世带来粘附于其思维和情感的不洁之物，故要在该区域被关押一段时间，直到这类不洁之物被除灭，也就是被抛到一边。一旦这些东西被抛到一边，这些人就能被提入天堂。在低地的人还不在大人里面，因为他们就像被输送到胃中的食物；这些食物在洁除渣滓之前，不可以被输送至循环的血液，进而被输送至体内。被尘世污垢玷污更严重的人在这些人之下的肠道区域；但经由肠道排出的粪便则对应于被称为排泄物地狱的地狱。</p>

Who they are that constitute the province of the intestines in the Grand Man, may be seen to some extent from those who relate to the stomach; for the intestines are continued from the stomach, and the 
functions of the stomach become there more vigorous and harsh down to the last intestines, which are the colon and rectum; for which reason they who are in these are near the hells which are called 
excremental. In the region of the stomach and intestines are they who are in the earth of lower things, who, because they have brought with them from the world unclean things that cling to their thoughts 
and affections, are kept there for some time, until such things have been wiped away, that is, cast to the sides; after this is done, they can be taken up into heaven. They who are there are not 
as yet in the Grand Man; for they are like food taken into the stomach, which is not admitted into the blood, and thus into the body, until it has been cleared of dregs. They who have been defiled with 
more earthly dregs are under these in the region of the intestines; but the excrements themselves that are discharged correspond to the hells called the excremental hells. </p>

Who exactly constitute the province of the Intestines in the Grand Man will become clear to some extent from those who correlate with the stomach. For the intestines are a continuation of the stomach, 
and the functions performed by the stomach increase in them and are intensified right through to the end of the intestines - to the colon and rectum. The spirits in the latter are therefore close to 
the hells which are called the excrementitious ones. In the region of the stomach and intestines are those on the lower earth. Because these have brought with them from the world forms of uncleanness 
clinging to their thoughts and affections, they are therefore detained for a while in that region until such forms of uncleanness have been wiped away, that is, cast away to the side. Once these have 
been cast away to the side those people can be raised up to heaven. People on the lower earth are not yet in the Grand Man, for they are like food which has been sent down into the stomach but which, 
until it has been purged, is not introduced into the bloodstream and so into the body. People contaminated with even worse earthly defilements are below those in the region of the intestines; but the 
actual excrement passed by the intestines corresponds to the hells called the excrementitious hells. </p>

</p><b>5392.</b>
Quinam sunt qui Intestinorum provinciam in Maximo Homine constituunt, constare aliquatenus potest ab illis qui ventriculum referunt, nam intestina continuantur ventriculo, et munia ventriculi ibi crescunt 
et exacerbantur usque ad intestina ultima, quae sunt colon et rectum; quapropter qui in his sunt, prope sunt ad inferna quae excrementitia vocantur.  In regione ventriculi et intestinorum sunt 
illi qui in inferiore {1} terra; qui quia secum e mundo traxerunt immunda quae inhaerent cogitationibus et affectionibus eorum, eapropter tenentur ibi ad aliquod tempus, usque dum talia abstersa sunt, 
hoc est, ad latus conjecta; his itaque ad latus conjectis {2}, ad caelum elevari possunt; qui ibi sunt, nondum sunt in Maximo Homine, sunt enim sicut alimenta in ventriculum demissa, quae non nisi quam 
cum defaecata sunt, in sanguinem, ita in corpus intromittuntur; qui terrestrioribus faecibus inquinati sunt, illi sunt sub illis in regione intestinorum, at ipsa excrementa quae exonerantur {3}, correspondent 
infernis quae inferna excrementitia vocantur. </p>
