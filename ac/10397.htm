<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10397节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10397</strong>.“百姓就聚集到亚伦那里”表他们转向圣言、教会和敬拜的外在，与内在之物分离。这从“聚集”的含义和“亚伦”的代表清楚可知：“聚集”是指转向；“亚伦”在此是指圣言、教会和敬拜的外在，与内在之物分离。亚伦在此之所以具有这种代表，是因为摩西缺席的时候，他是这个民族的头，缺席的摩西代表圣言（教会和敬拜源于圣言），无论在其内在意义上还是在其外在意义上（参看<a href="9372.htm">9372</a>节提到的地方）。亚伦具有这样一个代表的事实，从下面所提到的涉及亚伦的每一个事物也明显看出来，即：正是他造了牛犊，宣告一个节日，使百姓放肆，而这一切完全符合脱离内在的圣言、教会和敬拜的外在。凡将圣言、教会和敬拜的内在与外在分离的人都将它与神性和神圣之物分离。因为这些的内在是他们的灵；而外在是属于这灵的身体；没有灵的身体是死的。因此，敬拜死物就是敬拜偶像，在此是敬拜一只金牛犊，宣告向它守节日，从而使百姓放肆。由此可见在本章“亚伦”表示什么。至于何为圣言、教会和敬拜的内在，何为它们的外在，这在前文已经说明。</p>

And the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron. That this signifies that they turned themselves to the externals of the Word, of the church, and of worship, separate from what is internal, is 
evident from the signification of "gathering themselves together," as being to turn themselves; and from the representation of Aaron, as here being the external of the Word, of the church, and of worship, 
separate from the internal. This is here represented by Aaron, because during the absence of Moses, he was the head of that nation, and by Moses, who was absent, is represented the Word (from which 
the church and worship are derived) in both the internal and the external sense (see the places cited in n. 9372). That such is the representation of Aaron is plain also from each and all things related 
of Aaron in what follows; namely, that it was he who made the calf and proclaimed a feast and made the people lax, all of which coincides with the external of the Word, of the church, and of worship, 
separate from the internal. He who separates the internal of the Word, of the church, and of worship from the external, separates from it the holy Divine. For the internal of these is their spirit; 
but the external is the body of this spirit, and the body without the spirit is dead; and accordingly to worship what is dead is to worship an idol, in this case to worship the golden calf and to 
proclaim a feast to it, and so to make the people lax. From all this it can be seen what is signified by "Aaron" in this chapter. What the internal of the Word, of the church, and of worship is, and 
what their external, has been shown in what goes before. </p>

'And the people gathered together to Aaron' means that they directed themselves to the outward features of the Word, the Church, and worship, detached from what was inward. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'gathering themselves together' as directing themselves; and from the representation of 'Aaron' here as the outward aspect of the Word, the Church, and worship, detached from the inward. The reason 
why Aaron has this representation here is that in the absence of Moses he was the head of that nation, and Moses, who was absent, represents the Word, from which the Church and worship are derived, 
in both its inward and its outward senses, see in the places referred to in <a href="9372.htm">9372</a>. The fact that Aaron has such a representation here is also evident from every single thing that is mentioned in what 
follows regarding Aaron, namely that it was he who made the calf, proclaimed the feast, and caused the people to become undisciplined, all of which is in exact accord with the outward aspect of the 
Word, the Church, and worship, when detached from the inward. Anyone who separates the inward aspect of the Word, the Church, and worship from the outward separates from it that which is Divine and holy. 
For the inward aspect of these is their spirit, whereas the outward is the body belonging to that spirit; and the body without the spirit is dead. To worship what is dead therefore is to worship 
an idol, in this instance to worship a golden calf, proclaim a feast to it, and so cause the people to become undisciplined, from all of which it becomes clear what 'Aaron' means in the present chapter. 
What the inward aspect of the Word, the Church, and worship is, and what their outward aspect is, has been shown in what has gone before.  </p>

`Et congregatus est populus ad Aharonem': quod significet quod se contulerit ad externa Verbi, Ecclesiae, et cultus separata ab interno, constat ex significatione `congregari' quod sit se conferre, 
et ex repraesentatione `Aharonis' quod hic sit externum Verbi, Ecclesiae, (c)et cultus separatum ab interno; quod hoc per Aharonem hic repraesentetur, est quia {1}erat caput illius gentis absente Mosche, 
et per Moschen, qui aberat, repraesentatur Verbum, ex quo Ecclesia et cultus, tam in sensu interno quam externo, videatur in locis citatis n. 9372; quod tale per Aharonem hic repraesentetur, patet 
etiam ab omnibus et singulis quae de Aharone in sequentibus memorantur, quod nempe ille fuerit qui fecit vitulum, et proclamavit festum, {2}et dissolutum fecit populum{3}; quae omnia coincidunt cum externo 
Verbi, Ecclesiae, et cultus separato ab interno. Qui {4} separat internum Verbi, Ecclesiae, et cultus ab externo, ille separat sanctum Divinum ab illo, internum enim eorum est spiritus eorum, externum 
autem est corpus illius spiritus; et corpus absque spiritu est mortuum; colere itaque mortuum est colere idolum, hic colere vitulum aureum, et proclamare ei festum, et sic dissolutum facere populum; 
ex his constare potest quid per `Aharonem' in hoc capite significatur. Quid internum Verbi, Ecclesiae, et cultus, et quid externum eorum, in antecedentibus ostensum est. @1 After Mosche,$ @2
