<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6914节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6914.</strong>“我必叫这百姓在埃及人眼前蒙恩”表那些陷入虚假的人由于所受的灾殃而在那些属于属灵教会之人面前的惧怕。这从“蒙恩”的含义，以及以色列人和“埃及人”的代表清楚可知：“蒙恩”是指由于所受的灾殃而惧怕，如下文所述；以色列人，即此处的“百姓”是指那些属于属灵教会的人（参看<a href="6637.htm">6637</a>节）；“埃及人”是指那些陷入虚假的人，如前面频繁所述。“在埃及人眼前蒙恩”表示由于所受的灾殃而存在于那些陷入虚假之人里面的惧怕，这一点从内义所描述的事明显看出来；因为所论述的主题是那些陷入虚假的人，他们由“埃及人”来表示；真理与良善要从他们那里被夺走，转到那些属于属灵教会的人那里。由于所论述的主题是那些陷入虚假的人，所以“蒙恩”不是指恩惠，因为那些陷入虚假的人永远不会向任何人施恩惠。即便厚待某人，或不恶待他，他们也是出于害怕灾殃而如此行；这才是他们施恩惠的原因。这种恩惠就是此处在内义上所表示的那种。内义阐述事物本来的样子，而不是呈现在文字上的样子，并使每个细节都与主题相关。这一事实从下面关于埃及人的经文也明显可知，因为他们容以色列人去不是出于什么恩惠，而是出于对更多灾殃的惧怕（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出11.1.htm">11:1</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.33.htm">12:33</a>）。<br />这两节经文在说到以色列的妇人向埃及妇人要金银和衣裳时，提到“掠夺埃及人”。若不通过关于来世所发生之事的启示，根本不可能知道这是怎么回事，因为内义包含发生在天使和灵人中间的那类事，故有必要讨论这个问题。在主降临之前，天堂的低层部分被邪恶的魔鬼和灵人占据，但后来他们从那里被赶出去了，于是那片区域就被交给那些属于属灵教会的人（参看<a href="6858.htm">6858</a>节）。只要邪恶的魔鬼和灵人在那里，他们就不断受到高层天堂天使的监视，以此被制止公然行恶。今天还有一些人比其他人更有欺骗性，因为他们通过伪装纯真和仁爱迷惑人们，他们在属天天使的监视下，并且只要受到监视，他们就被阻止使用难以启齿的邪恶伎俩。他们在头顶正上方，而监视他们的属天天使更高。我由此得以知道，在主降临之前，占据天使低层区域的邪恶魔鬼和灵人是何状况，即：在此期间，他们被高层天堂天使阻止公然行恶。<br />我还得以知道他们以哪种方式被阻止公然行恶。他们被保持在外在束缚中，这些束缚就是害怕丧失地位和名声，害怕被剥夺他们在那片区域所占据的地盘，害怕被推下地狱；那时，简单的善灵依附于他们。这就像是世人的情形，尽管他们内心是魔鬼，但这些外在束缚仍迫使他们保持高尚正义的伪装，还迫使他们行善。为叫他们能继续以这些方式行事，处于简单良善的灵人便依附于他们。在主降临之前，在天堂低层区域的恶灵也是这种情形。那时，他们也能被自己的爱驱使谈真理、行良善。他们与邪恶的牧师，甚至最坏的牧师没什么两样，因为这些牧师内心虽是魔鬼，却能以如此的炽热和伪装的热情宣扬其教会的教义，以致他们能将听众的心变得敬虔。然而，他们一直被自我之爱和尘世之爱所主宰，因为他们对于自己地位和利益的思维在他们里面处处掌权，如同一团火激发他们以这种方式宣扬这些教义。有些恶灵与他们同在，这些恶灵被同样的恶所主宰，因而以同样的方式思考，并引导他们；而善灵只是依附于他们。由此可见在主降临之前，天堂是何状态。<br />但主降临之后，天堂与地狱的状态完全变了，因为那时，占据天堂低层区域的邪恶魔鬼和灵人被扔了下去，取而代之的是那些被提到那里的属于属灵教会的人。那时，被扔下去的恶灵失去了外在束缚；如前所述，这些束缚就是害怕丧失地位和利益，害怕被剥夺他们在那片区域所占据的地盘。他们以这种方式被留在自己的内层，这些内层完全是属魔鬼和地狱的，他们因此被逐入地狱。在来世，除去外在束缚是通过撤走依附于他们的善灵实现的；当善灵被撤走时，恶灵就无法再保持任何良善、正义和高尚的伪装了，只能照他们在世时内心的样子，也就是照他们那时向别人隐藏的真实想法和欲望行事；这时，他们只想行恶。从他们那里被撤走的这些简单善灵就被交给或依附于那些属于属灵教会的人，天堂的那片区域作为一个产业被赐给他们。正因如此，这些简单善灵富有之前邪恶的魔鬼和灵人所掌握的真理与良善。事实上，在来世，富有真理与良善是通过处于真理与良善的灵人的依附实现的，因为交流通过他们实现。<br />这些事就是以色列人不至于从埃及空手而去，妇人向她的邻舍并居住在她家里的妇人要银器、金器和衣裳，以此掠夺埃及人所表示的。谁都能看出，若不是代表上述这类事，神性永远不会吩咐以色列人利用这种诡计对付埃及人；因为像这样的一切行为都与神性相去甚远。不过，由于以色列民完全是代表，所以神性允许他们这样做；事实上，在来世，这种事会行在以这种方式行事的恶灵身上。要知道，就内义而言，耶和华或主所吩咐的许多事并不是祂所吩咐的事，而是被允许的事。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6914</b></p><p><b>6914.</b>
And I will give this people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians. That this signifies the fear of those who are in falsities before those who are of the spiritual church, by reason of the plagues, is evident 
from the signification of "giving favor," as being fear by reason of plagues (of which below); from the representation of the sons of Israel, who are here "the people," as being those who are of 
the spiritual church (see n. 6637); and from the representation of the Egyptians, as being those who are in falsities (of which frequently above). That "to give favor in the eyes of the Egyptians" signifies 
fear by reason of plagues with those who are in falsities, is evident from the meaning of the things in the internal sense, for those who are in falsities are treated of, who are signified by 
the "Egyptians," in that truths and goods were to be taken away from them, and to be transferred to those who are of the spiritual church; and as those who are in falsities are treated of, by "favor" 
is not meant favor, for they who are in falsities and evils never have any favor for anyone; but if they benefit anyone, or do not injure him, it is from fear of plagues; this is the source of their 
favor, and this is the "favor" which is here meant in the internal sense. The internal sense sets forth things such as they are, not such as they are presented in the letter; and applies each to the subject. 
That this is so, is plain also from what follows concerning the Egyptians, in that they did not let the sons of Israel go from any favor, but from fear on account of further plagues (Exod. 11:1; 
12:33). [2] As the spoiling of the Egyptians is treated of in these two verses by the women of Israel asking from the Egyptian women silver, gold, and garments, and as it cannot possibly be known 
how this is, except from revelation about the things that take place in the other life, for the internal sense involves such things as take place among angels and spirits, therefore it shall be told. 
That before the Lord's coming the lower part of heaven was occupied by evil genii and spirits, and that they were afterward expelled thence and that region given to those of the spiritual church, may 
be seen above (n. 6858). So long as the evil genii and spirits were there, they were under the continual view of the angels of the higher heaven, and by this they were restrained from doing evils openly. 
At this day also some who are more deceitful than others, because they deceive by a pretence of innocence and charity, are under the view of the celestials, and so long as this is the case they are 
withheld from their wicked arts. They are directly above the head, and the celestial angels, under whose view they are, are still higher. From this it has been given me to know what was the state of 
the evil genii and spirits who before the coming of the Lord occupied the lower region of heaven, namely, that at that time they were withheld by the angels of the higher heaven from doing evils openly. 
 [3] But in what manner they were withheld from doing evils openly, it has also been given me to know. They were kept in external bonds, namely, in fear of the loss of honor and reputation, and in 
fear of the deprivation of possessions in that region of heaven, and of being thrust down into hell; and then there were joined to them simple good spirits; as is the case with men in the world, who, 
though inwardly devils, are nevertheless kept by such external bonds in the pretence of what is honorable and just, and in well-doing; and in order that they may be so kept, there are joined to them 
spirits who are in simple good. This was the case with the evil who were in the lower region of heaven before the coming of the Lord; and then they also could be driven to speak truth and to do good 
by means of their own loves; no otherwise than evil priests, even the worst, who are devils inwardly, who can preach the doctrinal things of their own church with such ardor and pretended zeal as to move 
the hearts of their hearers to piety, and yet at the same time they are in the love of self and of the world. For thought about honor and gain is what universally reigns within them, and from this 
fire they are stirred up so to preach. It is the evil spirits with whom they are, and who are in similar love, and thence in similar thought, who lead them; and to these are joined simple good spirits. 
From all this it can be seen what the state of heaven was before the Lord's coming. [4] But after His coming the states of heaven and of hell were quite changed, for then the evil genii and spirits 
who occupied the lower region of heaven were cast down, and in their stead they who were of the spiritual church were taken up thither. The evil who were cast down were then deprived of the external 
bonds which as before said were fears of the loss of honor and reputation, and of the losing of possessions in that region; and in this way they were left to their interiors, which were no other than 
diabolical and infernal, and so they were consigned to the hells. The taking away of external bonds is effected in the other life by the removal of the good spirits who had been joined to the evil ones. 
When these are removed, the infernals can no longer be in any pretence of what is good, just, and honorable, but are such as they had been inwardly in the world, that is, such as they had been in 
thought and will, which they had there concealed from others; and then they desire nothing else than to do evil. These simple good spirits who were taken away from them, were given or joined to those 
who were of the spiritual church, to whom that region of heaven was given for a possession; and it was from this that these latter were enriched with the truths and goods which were before in the possession 
of the evil genii and spirits; for enrichment in truths and goods in the other life is effected by the adjoining of spirits who are in truth and good, because through these is effected communication. 
 [5] This is what is signified by the sons of Israel not going empty from Egypt, and by a woman asking of her neighbor, and of her that sojourned in her house, vessels of silver, and vessels of 
gold, and garments, and thus spoiling the Egyptians. Everyone can see that unless such things had been represented, the Divine would never have commanded that the sons of Israel should use such guile 
against the Egyptians; for every such thing is very far from the Divine. But as the Israelitish people was altogether representative, it was permitted them by the Divine to do so, because it was so 
done with the evil in the other life. Be it known that very many things which were commanded by Jehovah or the Lord, in the internal sense do not signify that they were commanded, but that they were permitted. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6914</b></p><p><b>6914.</b>
'And I will give this people favour in the eyes of the Egyptians means fear, on account of the plagues, which those steeped in falsities had of those belonging to the spiritual Church. This is clear 
from the meaning of 'giving favour' as fear on account of the plagues, dealt with below; from the representation of the children of Israel, to whom 'people' refers here, as those belonging to the spiritual 
Church, dealt with in <a href="6637.htm">6637</a>; and from the representation of 'the Egyptians' as those who are steeped in falsities, often dealt with already. The fact that 'giving favour in the eyes of the Egyptians' 
means fear on account of the plagues that is present in those steeped in falsities is clear when one understands the matters described in the internal sense; for the subject is those who are steeped 
in falsities, meant by 'the Egyptians' - with the truths and forms of good which are to be taken away from them and passed on to those who belong to the spiritual Church. And since the subject is 
those who are steeped in falsities, 'favour' does not mean favour, for people who are steeped in falsities and evils do not feel in any way at all disposed to show favour towards anyone. If they treat 
anyone well or do not treat him badly they do so through fear of 'plagues'; these are the reason for their show of favour. This favour is the kind meant here in the internal sense. The internal sense 
displays things as they really are, not as they are made to stand in the letter, and makes every detail relevant to the subject. The truth of this is also evident from what follows regarding the Egyptians, 
where it is evident that they did not let the children of Israel go out of any disposition to show them favour, only out of fear on account of further plagues, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2011:1;%2012:33&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 11:1; 12:33</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 These two 
verses, when they say that the women of Israel were to ask the Egyptian women for silver, gold, and clothes, refer to 'the plundering' of the Egyptians. And because what is meant by this cannot at 
all be known except from a revelation describing things that take place in the next life - for the internal sense contains the kinds of things that take place among angels and spirits - the matter must 
therefore be discussed. Before the Lord's Coming the lower parts of heaven had been occupied by evil genii and spirits; but afterwards they were driven out from there and that region was given to those 
who belonged to the spiritual Church, see above in <a href="6858.htm">6858</a>. As long as the evil genii and spirits were there they were under constant watch by angels belonging to a higher heaven and were thereby restrained 
from committing evil deeds openly. At the present day too some who are more devious than others because they mislead people by their pretence of innocence and charity are under watch by celestial 
ones, and so long as they are under it they are held back from their unspeakable tricks. They are directly overhead; but the celestial angels under whose watch they are kept are even higher. This 
has allowed me to know what the situation was like of the evil genii and spirits who occupied the lower region of heaven before the Lord's Coming; during that time they were held back by angels belonging 
to a higher heaven from committing evil deeds openly. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But as for the way in which they were held back from committing evil deeds openly, this too [have been allowed to know. They were kept 
in check by external restraints, which were fear of the loss of position and reputation, and fear that they would be deprived of places they hold in that region of heaven and would be thrust down into 
hell; and at that time good yet simple spirits were attached to them. It was like what happens with people in the world. Even though inwardly they may be devils those external restraints force them to 
keep up a pretence of honourableness and righteousness and to do good. And to ensure that they go on behaving in these ways spirits who are governed by simple good are attached to them. The situation 
was similar with the evil who were in the lower region of heaven before the Lord's Coming. At that time too they could be driven by selfish kinds of love to speak what was true and do what was good. 
They were not unlike wicked priests, indeed even very wicked ones, who inwardly are devils, but who can proclaim the teachings of their Church with such passion and seeming zeal that they move the hearts 
of their hearers to godliness Yet all the while they are ruled by self-love and love of the world, for the thought of their own position and gain reigns in every part of them and is what fires them 
to proclaim those teachings in such a way. There are evil spirits present with them, ruled by the same kind of love and consequently thinking in the same kind of way, who lead them; but good yet simple 
spirits are attached to them. From all this one may recognize what the state of heaven was like before the Lord's Coming. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 But after the Lord's Coming the states of heaven and hell were completely 
altered; for then the evil genii and spirits who occupied the lower region of heaven were cast down and were replaced by those raised up there who belonged to the spiritual Church. At that time 
the evil who were cast down had the external restraints taken away from them, which, as stated above, were fear of the loss of position and gain and deprivation of places they hold in that region. They 
were thus left to their inner selves, which were entirely devilish and hellish, and so were banished to the hells. The removal of external restraints is effected in the next life by withdrawing the 
good spirits who have been attached to them; and when they have been withdrawn the evil can no more maintain any pretence of goodness, righteousness, or honourableness, but can only behave in accord 
with what they had been like inwardly in the world, that is, in accord with what they had really thought and desired, which they had concealed from others there, their only wish being to do what is evil. 
The good yet simple spirits who were withdrawn from those evil spirits were assigned or attached to those who belonged to the spiritual Church, to whom that region of heaven was given as a possession. 
This is why they were enriched with the truths and forms of good which the evil genii and spirits had had previously. Enrichment with truths and forms of good is effected in the next life by means 
of the attachment of spirits with whom truth and goodness are present; for communication is effected through them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 These things are what are meant by the statement that the children of Israel 
would not go out of Egypt empty-handed, and that a woman should ask of her female neighbour, and of the female guest in her house, vessels of silver, vessels of gold, and clothes, and in so doing would 
plunder the Egyptians. Anyone can see that unless the kinds of things described above had been represented the Divine would never have commanded them to use that kind of guile against the Egyptians; 
for all behaviour like that is very far removed from the Divine. But since those people were completely representative they were allowed by the Divine, because such a thing would be done to the evil 
in the next life, to act in that kind of way. It should be recognized that very many things which were commanded by Jehovah or the Lord do not in the internal sense mean things that were commanded by 
Him but those that were permitted. </p>

`Et dabo gratiam populi hujus in oculis Aegyptiorum': quod significet timorem illorum qui in falsis pro illis qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, propter plagas, constat a significatione `dare gratiam' quod 
sit timorem propter plagas, de qua sequitur; ex repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis,' qui hic sunt `populus,' quod sint qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, de qua n. 6637; et ex repraesentatione `Aegyptiorum' 
quod sint qui in falsis, de qua saepe prius.  Quod `dare gratiam in oculis Aegyptiorum' significet timorem propter plagas illis qui in falsis, constat ex intellectu rerum in sensu interno; agitur enim 
de illis qui in falsis, qui per `Aegyptios' significantur, quod illis auferenda sint vera et bona, et transferenda ad illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali; et quia de illis qui in falsis agitur, per `gratiam' 
non significatur gratia, nam illis qui in falsis et malis sunt, nusquam gratia est pro aliquo, sed si benefaciunt, aut si non malefaciunt, est ex timore propter plagas, inde gratia illorum; {1} 
haec gratia est quae in sensu interno hic intelligitur; sensus internus exponit res quales sunt, non quales sistuntur in littera, et applicat singula ad subjectum; (m)quod ita sit patet etiam a sequentibus 
de Aegyptiis, quod non dimiserint filios Israelis ex aliqua gratia, sed ex timore propter ulteriores plagas,(n) Exod. xi 1, xii 33. 	2 Quia in his binis versibus agitur de depraedatione Aegyptiorum, 
per `quod mulieres Israelis mutuo peterent a mulieribus Aegyptiis argentum, aurum, et vestes,' et quomodo hoc se habet, nequaquam sciri potest nisi ex revelatione de illis quae fiunt in altera 
vita, sensus enim internus {2} involvit talia quae {3}fiunt apud angelos et spiritus, idcirco dicendum: {4} quod locus caeli inferior {5}ante Adventum Domini a malis geniis et spiritibus occupatus fuerit, 
et quod inde postea expulsi, et regio illa data sit illis qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, videatur supra n. 6858; quamdiu mali genii et spiritus ibi erant, sub intuitu continuo angelorum (x)superioris 
caeli {6}fuerunt; inde arcebantur a malis aperte faciendis; hodie etiam quidam qui dolosiores aliis sunt, quia per {7}simulationem innocentiae et charitatis fallunt, sub intuitu caelestium sunt, et 
tamdiu detinentur a nefandis suis dolis; sunt illi directe supra caput, et angeli caelestes sub quorum intuitu sunt, adhuc superius; ex quibus scire datum est qualis status malorum geniorum et spirituum 
fuit qui ante Adventum Domini occuparunt inferiorem regionem caeli, quod nempe tunc a malis aperte faciendis ab angelis superioris caeli detenti fuerint. 	3 Quomodo autem a malis aperte faciendis 
detenti fuerint, etiam scire datum est: tenebantur in vinculis externis, nempe in timore jacturae honoris et famae, in timore deprivationis possessionum in regione illa caeli ac detrusionis in infernum; 
et tunc adjungebantur illis {8}spiritus boni simplices; sicut {9}fit hominibus {10} in mundo; {11}hi tametsi interius (t)sunt diaboli, usque tamen per externa illa vincula tenentur in simulatione 
honesti ac justi, et ad benefaciendum; utque ita teneantur, adjunguntur illis spiritus qui in simplici bono sunt; ita se habuit cum malis qui in regione inferiore caeli ante Adventum Domini fuerunt; et 
tunc quoque potuerunt adigi ad verum dicendum (c)et bonum faciendum per proprios amores; non aliter ac sacerdotes mali, immo etiam pessimi, qui intus diaboli sunt, qui {12}doctrinalia suae Ecclesiae 
cum {13} tali ardore et simulato zelo praedicare possunt ut corda auditorum ad pietatem moveant {14}; sunt {15}tamen tunc in {16}amore sui et mundi, nam cogitatio de honore et de lucro universaliter 
apud illos regnat, {17}ex illo igne ad ita praedicandum excitantur; sunt mali spiritus apud illos qui in simili amore et inde in simili cogitatione sunt, qui ducunt, {18}quibus adjuncti sunt {19} simplices 
boni spiritus; ex his constare potest qualis status caeli ante Adventum Domini fuit. 	4 Post autem Adventum Ipsius {20}caeli et inferni status prorsus mutati sunt; tunc enim mali genii et spiritus 
qui regionem caeli inferiorem occuparunt dejecti sunt, et loco illorum illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali illuc elevati; mali qui dejecti sunt tunc deprivati (d)sunt externis vinculis quae, ut supra 
dictum, fuerunt timores jacturae honoris et famae, ac amissionis possessionum in regione illa; (c)ac ita relicti sunt suis interioribus, quae non nisi quam diabolica et infernalia erant, et sic in inferna 
ablegati. Deprivatio a vinculis externis fit in altera vita per ablationem spirituum bonorum qui illis adjuncti sunt; cum hi {21}ablati sunt, non magis {22}possunt in aliqua simulatione boni, justi, 
et honesti esse, sed sunt quales in mundo fuerunt intus, hoc est, quales fuerunt cogitatione et voluntate, quas coram aliis ibi absconderunt; et tunc nihil aliud cupiunt quam malefacere.  Simplices 
hi boni spiritus qui illis ablati sunt dati seu adjuncti sunt illis qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, quibus regio illa caeli in possessionem data est; inde est quod hi locupletari sint veris et bonis quae 
prius {23}habuerunt mali genii et spiritus; nam locupletari veris et bonis in altera vita fit per adjunctionem spirituum qui in vero et bono sunt, nam per illos fit communicatio. 	5 Haec sunt quae 
significantur per quod `filii Israelis ab Aegypto non ituri vacui, {24}sed quod mulier a vicina sua et ab hospita domus suae peteret vasa argenti, et vasa auri, et vestes, et sic depraedarentur {25}Aegyptios.' 
Quisque videre potest quod nisi talia repraesentata fuissent, nusquam a Divino mandatum fuisset ut tali astu uterentur contra Aegyptios; omne enim tale longissime abest a Divino; sed quia populus 
ille prorsus repraesentativus esset, id, quia ita fieret cum malis in altera vita, permissum fuit a Divino ut ita facerent; sciendum est quod perplura quae mandata sunt a Jehovah seu Domino, in 
sensu interno non significent quod mandata sint, sed {26} quod permissa {27}. 	@1 i quae non est gratia ex libero, sed ex coacto,$ 	@2 i Verbi$ 	@3 existunt$ 	@4 i cum depraedatione Aegyptiorum ita
