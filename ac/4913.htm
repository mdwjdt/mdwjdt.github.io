<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4913节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4913.</strong>“因为我没有将她给我的儿子示拉”表因为外在就具有这样的性质。这从前面的解释清楚可知，即：他玛不能被给示拉，也就是犹大的儿子，因为在这种情况下，根据关于丈夫弟兄本分的律法，就会有像一个妻子与其丈夫那样的结合。而存在于他所要代表的犹太民族当中的宗教表象不是像丈夫那样的结合，而是像公公与儿媳，如同与一个妓女那样的结合。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4913</b></p><p><b>4913.</b>
Forasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah my son. That this signifies because the external was of such a quality, is evident from what has been explained above - that Tamar could not be given to Shelah, 
Judah's son, because in this case there would be conjunction as of a wife with her husband in accordance with the law in regard to the duty of a husband's brother; whereas the religiosity of the Jewish 
nation, which was to be represented, was not such, but was such as is the conjunction of a father-in-law with a daughter-in-law as with a harlot. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4913</b></p><p><b>4913.</b>
'Seeing that I have not given her to Shelah my son' means because what was external was of such a nature. This becomes clear from what has been explained already - that Tamar could not be given to Shelah, 
Judah's son, because if she had been the joining together would have been as that of a wife and husband married to each other through the law of leviratical marriage. But the semblance of religion 
existing among the Jewish nation which he was to represent was not like that husband but like a father-in-law joined to a daughter-in-law as to a prostitute. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 4913</b>
</p><b>4913.</b>
`Quia propterea quod non dedi illam Shelae filio meo': quod significet quia externum tale, constare potest ex illis quae prius explicata sunt, quod nempe Tamar non potuerit dari Shelae filio Jehudae, 
quia sic conjunctio fieret sicut uxoris cum marito secundum legem de leviratu, et tamen religiosum gentis Judaicae quod repraesentaretur, non fuit tale, sed fuit qualis est conjunctio soceri cum 
nuru, ut cum meretrice. </p>
