<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第27节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>27.</strong>创世记1:9 神说：“天下的水要聚在一处，使旱地露出来”，事就这样成了。<br />当人发觉他有内在和外在，且真理与良善是由主那里从内在流入外在的（虽看似并非如此），这种对真理与良善的认识就被存入他的记忆，归于知识当中。因为凡是被存入外在记忆的，无论是属世的、属灵的还是属天的，都作为知识储存起来，主从中加以利用。这些知识即“聚在一处的水”，称为“海”。人的外在则被称为“旱地”，接下来又被称为“地”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]27.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_27/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_9" target=_top>Genesis 1:9</a>. And God said, "Let the waters under heaven be gathered into one place, and let dry land appear;" and so it was done.<br />When we learn that we have an inner self and an outer, and that truth and goodness come from the inner self — or rather from the Lord by way of the inner self into the outer, even though this is contrary to appearances — this information, this knowledge of truth and goodness, is stored away in our memory. The knowledge takes its place among the secular facts we have learned, because anything instilled in our outward memory, whether earthly, spiritual, or heavenly, lodges there as a fact, and from there the Lord draws on it.<br />This knowledge is the waters gathered into one place and named seas. The outer being itself, on the other hand, is called dry land. Immediately afterward it is called earth, as the next verse shows. </p>

Verse 9. And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together to one place, and let the dry [land] appear; and it was so. When it is known that there is both an internal and an external 
man, and that truths and goods flow in from, or through, the internal man to the external, from the Lord, although it does not so appear, then those truths and goods, or the knowledges of the true and 
the good in the regenerating man, are stored up in his memory, and are classed among its knowledges [scientifica]; for whatsoever is insinuated into the memory of the external man, whether it be natural, 
or spiritual, or celestial, abides there as memory-knowledge [scientificum], and is brought forth thence by the Lord. These knowledges are the "waters gathered together into one place" and are called 
"seas" but the external man himself is called the "dry [land]" and presently "earth" as in what follows. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 27</b></p><p><b>27.</b>
Verse 9 And God said, Let the waters under heaven be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear; and it was so. </p>
<p>Once a person knows of the existence of the internal man and of the 
external man, and knows that, contrary to appearance, truths and goods flow in from the internal man, or from the Lord by way of the internal into the external, then the things residing in him as cognitions 
of truth and good are stored away in his memory and registered among the facts there. For anything that finds its way into the memory or the external man, whether natural, spiritual, or celestial, 
lodges there as known fact, and from that place it is brought out by the Lord. These cognitions are 'the waters gathered together to one place' and are called 'seas'. But the external man itself 
is called 'the dry land' and immediately afterwards 'earth', as in the verses that follow. </p>

</p><b>27.</b>
Vers. 9.  Et dixit Deus, Congregentur aquae sub caelo ad locum unum, et appareat arida; et factum ita.  Cum novit quod homo internus et extemus detur, et quod vera et bona ab homine interno, seu per 
hominem internum ad externum, a Domino influant, tametsi non ita apparet, tunc illa, seu cognitiones veri et boni, quae apud eum, in memoria ejus reconduntur et inter scientifica referuntur; quicquid 
enim memoriae externi hominis insinuatur, sive naturale sit, sive spirituale, sive caeleste, ibi manet ut scientificum, et inde producitur a Domino. Cognitiones illae sunt 'aquae congregatae ad locum 
unum,' et vocantur 'maria'; ipse autem homo externus vocatur 'arida,' et mox 'terra,' secundum haec quae sequuntur.
