<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1270.</strong>不久，有人从那地狱被放出来，不过，主是藉着中间的灵人和天使安排这一切的，免得他们伤害我。他们从深渊移到靠前的位置，觉得自己在向前推进，仿佛穿过了岩石的洞穴，以这种方式升到顶部。最后，他们从上面出现在左侧，以便从那里，因而从远处流入我。我被告知，他们可以流入我脑袋的右侧，但不可流入左侧；然后从脑袋右侧流入胸腔左侧；但绝不可流入脑袋左侧，否则，我必遭到毁灭，因为这时，他们会带着自己那可怕、致命的信念流入；不过，他们是藉着恶欲流入脑袋右侧的，由此流入胸腔的左侧。这是流注的情形。<br />他们的信念是能毁灭一切真理和良善的那一种。因此，他们所流入的那些人什么也感知不到，之后甚至无法思考；这也是为何这些灵人被移除的原因。当他们开始流入时，我便睡着了。然后，趁我睡觉的时候，他们藉着恶欲流入，并且如此强烈，以致哪怕我醒着都无法抵挡他们。在睡梦中，我能感觉到一种无法描述的压迫感，后来只记得他们想通过令人窒息的气息杀死我，这简直就象一场可怕的噩梦。就在醒来的那一刻，我发现他们就在我旁边。不过，他们意识到我醒了，就逃回自己的位置，从那里流入。<br />当他们在那里时，在我看来，他们仿佛正被包裹在前面所说的那种布里面（<a href="964.htm">964</a>节）。我以为是那些恶灵被包裹在里面，但其实是他们正在包裹其他灵人。这事是通过幻觉完成的，然而，他们通过幻觉以这种方式所攻击的灵人只知道自己真的被卷起来。他们所卷起的那些灵人似乎沿着岩石斜坡滚了下去，不过，那些被如此卷起来的灵人被释放了，得以自由。他们是不肯离去、因而被主保守的灵人，否则，他们必窒息而死。虽然他们会复活，但要经历极大的苦难。就在这时，被允许从那地狱出来的灵人顺着岩石斜坡回来了。只听见那个地方传来钻探声，仿佛有很多大钻头在工作。我发觉这声音出自他们反对主的极端残酷的幻觉。后来，他们被丢了下去，穿过被雾笼罩的岩石下面的阴暗洞穴回到自己的地狱。他们在灵人界期间，那里整个气场的结构都被改变了。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1270.</strong> Before long, a group of beings issued out of that hell, but the Lord, using spirits and angels to intervene, arranged it so that nothing could hurt me. They came forward out of that depth and seemed to themselves to struggle onward — and so upward — through what appeared to be caves in a cliff. At last they could be seen above on the left, so that from there, at a distance, they would be able to exert an influence on me.<br />I was told that they were allowed to affect the right half of my head but not the left, and through the right half of my head the left side of my chest, but never the left part of my head. Had they done so, it would have been the end of me, because they would then have flowed in with their self-deceptions, which are horrendous and deadly. Since they were to act on the right part of my head and from there the left part of my chest, they would use various intense desires as their means. This is how the case with spiritual influence stands.<br />[2] Their delusions are strong enough to snuff out everything true or good, preventing the people they affect from perceiving anything and consequently from thinking anything. So the spirits were also removed.<br />When they started to work their influence, I fell asleep. Then, while I slept, they worked on me with their cravings. Their influence was so forceful that I would never have been able to resist them while awake. Asleep, I sensed their pressure, but I cannot describe it, except to say that I later recalled how they tried their worst to murder me with a suffocating vapor that was like a vicious incubus.{*1} Then I woke up and noticed that they were near me, but when they became aware that I was awake, they escaped to a place up above and acted on me from there.<br />[3] While they were there, it seemed to me as if they were being wound up in a cloth, of the kind mentioned in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1270/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_964" target=_top>964</a>. I thought it was the pre-Flood people who were being wrapped up, but it was others, and they themselves were doing the wrapping. They accomplish this through hallucinations, but the spirits they are victimizing in fantasy this way have no idea that it is not actually happening. It appeared as though they took the spirits they were binding up and rolled them down the steep face of a rock, but the victims were released and freed. (These were spirits who were unwilling to run away, so the Lord protected them. Otherwise they would have suffocated. They would have come back to life, but only after suffering excruciating pain.)<br />Next they retreated down the slope of rock. I heard a drilling sound coming from there, as if many huge drills were at work, and I perceived that their fantasies of terrible cruelty against the Lord were the source of the sound. Later they were forced down through the shadowy caves under the foggy crag into their hell.<br />When they were in the world of spirits, the composition of the atmosphere there changed.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The Latin word incubus stems from the Latin incubare, "to lie on." In medieval folklore, an incubus was a nightmare personified as a demon thought to lie on sleeping people, sometimes with sexual, sometimes with murderous, intent. Swedenborg rarely uses the word, and never in an overtly sexual context. In one passage he uses it to mean simply a nightmare involving a great pressure or sense of weight on the chest, without any apparent demonic connotations (see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1270/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_482#subsection-2-2" target=_top>True Christianity 482:2</a>). In the current passage and its parallel in Spiritual Experiences (Swedenborg 1998-2002) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1270/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_3364" target=_top>3364</a>, he identifies evil spirits as the cause of such a nightmare. For Swedenborg's discussion of the incubus as a disease, see Draft on the Fiber (Swedenborg 1976a) 534-536. On the phenomenon of the incubus in world culture, see Sleep Paralysis 2005, 5-145.

Presently some were let out of that hell; but the Lord made such a disposition by means of intermediate spirits and angels that they could do me no harm. Out of that deep they came in front, and appeared 
to themselves to be working their way toward the front, as it were through caverns in the rock, and so upward. At last they appeared from above to the left, in order that from there, and thus from 
a distance, they might inflow into me. I was told that they were permitted to inflow into the right side of the head, but not into the left side; and from the right side of the head into the left side 
of the chest; but by no means into the left of the head, for if this occurred I should be destroyed, because they would then flow in with their persuasions, which are direful and deadly; whereas if 
they flowed into the right of the head, and thence into the left of the chest, it would be by means of cupidities. Such is the case with influx.  [2] Their persuasions are of such a nature that they 
extinguish all truth and good, so that those into whom they flow can perceive nothing whatever, and after that cannot think; and therefore the other spirits were removed. When they began to flow in I 
fell asleep. Then while I slept they flowed in by means of cupidities, and this with such violence that if awake I could not have resisted them. In my sleep I was sensible of the vehemence of it, which 
I cannot describe, save that I afterwards remembered that they tried to kill me by a suffocating afflatus, which was like a terrible nightmare. Then, waking, I observed that they were near me; and 
when they perceived that I was awake, they fled away to their own place above, and flowed in from thence.  [3] When they were there they appeared to me as if they were being wrapped up in a cloth, such 
as was spoken of before (n. 964). I thought they were being thus wrapped up, but it was others whom they were wrapping up. This is effected by means of phantasies; but yet the spirits against whom 
they thus work by phantasies know not but that they are really being wrapped up. It appeared as if those whom they thus wrapped up rolled down a certain rocky declivity. But those who were thus wrapped 
up were released and set at liberty. They were spirits who were unwilling to withdraw, and who were thus preserved by the Lord, for otherwise they would have been suffocated-although they would have 
revived again, but after great suffering. The spirits from that hell then went back by the rocky declivity; and there was heard from thence a sound of boring, as if many great boring instruments were 
at work; and it was perceived that it was from their intensely cruel phantasies against the Lord that such a sound came. They were afterwards cast down through dark caverns into their hell beneath the 
misty rock. While they were in the world of spirits, the constitution or order of the sphere there was changed.* * See Spiritual Experiences, n. 3367. [Reviser.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1270</b></p><p><b>1270.</b>
Soon after this some were let out of that hell, but the Lord so arranged it by means of spirits and angels in between that those let out could do me no harm. From that place deep down they moved to a 
forward position. To themselves they seemed to be pressing forward towards the front, so to speak through caverns in the rock, and in this way up to the top. They at length appeared up on the left so 
that from there, and so at a distance, they might flow into me. I was told that they were being allowed to flow into the right part of my head but not into the left, and then from the right part of the 
head into the left part of the chest. They were altogether prevented from flowing into the left part of my head, for if that were to happen I would be destroyed since they would in that case be flowing 
in with their own persuasions that are dreadful and deadly. But when they were flowing into the right part of the head and from there into the left part of the breast, they were doing so by means 
of evil desires. This is how it is with influx. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Their persuasions are such as to destroy everything true and good. As a consequence those into whom they flow are unable to perceive anything, or 
after that even to think. This also was why the spirits were being removed. When they started to flow in I fell asleep. Then while I slept they flowed in by means of evil desires, so powerfully in fact 
that had I been awake I could not have withstood them. In my sleep I felt a pressure upon me which I cannot describe, only that I subsequently remembered that they had attempted to kill me by a stifling 
exhalation, which was like a terrible nightmare. At that point I woke up and noticed that they were near me. But when they realized that I was awake they fled to their own position higher up and 
flowed in from there. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 While they were there it seemed to me as though they were being rolled up in a cloth, as in the incident described in <a href="964.htm">964</a>. I thought that it was those evil spirits who were 
being rolled up in it, but in fact it was they who were doing it to others. This is achieved by means of delusions, yet the spirits against whom they act in this way by delusions are not aware of 
anything other than of being actually rolled up. It seemed that those whom they were rolling up in this way rolled down the slope of some rock, but those who had been so rolled up were released and set 
free. They were spirits who did not wish to leave and so were preserved by the Lord or else they would have been suffocated. Although they would have revived they would have done so after much suffering. 
At that point those who had been allowed out from the hell below went back by way of the slope on the rock. From that place came a drilling sound as though many large drills were at work, and I 
perceived that the sound was the product of extremely painful delusions against the Lord's existence. Subsequently they were sent down through the gloomy caverns beneath the rock enveloped in mist into 
their own hell While they were in the world of spirits the whole constitution of the sphere there was altered. </p>

</p><b>1270.</b>
Mox quidam ex inferno isto emissi sunt, sed disposuit Dominus per spiritus et angelos intermedios ut mihi nihil nocere possent; e profundo isto veniebant antrorsum, et moliri sibi viam videbantur versus 
anteriora per quasi rupis cavernas, et sic sursum; apparebant tandem ad sinistrum superne, ut inde, sic e longinquo, in me influerent: dicebatur mihi quod liceret eis influere in dextram partem capitis, 
non autem in sinistram, et a dextra parte capitis in sinistrum latus thoracis, nequaquam in sinistrum capitis, nam si hoc fieret, quod deperditus essem; tunc enim cum persuasionibus suis quae 
dirae et lethales, influerent, at cum in dextrum capitis et inde in sinistrum pectoris, quod esset per cupiditates; ita se res habet cum influxu.  [2] Persuasiones eorum tales sunt ut exstinguant omne 
verum et bonum, sic ut non possint ii in quos influunt, percipere quicquam, et dein nec cogitare; quare etiam spiritus removebantur: cum inciperent influere, lapsus sum in somnum; influebant tunc cum 
dormirem per cupiditates, et quidem tam graviter ut in vigilia iis non resistere potuissem; in somno sentiebam gravitatem quam describere non possum, solum quod reminiscebar dein quod aggressi sint me 
necare per afflatum suffocativum, qui fuit sicut saevus incubus; sed tunc expergefactus animadvertebam quod prope me essent, at cum apperciperent me vigilem, aufugiebant ad locum suum superius et inde 
influebant.  [3] Cum ibi essent, visi mihi quasi involverentur panno, tali de quo n. 964; putabam quod ii essent, sed erant alii quos ii involvebant, quod fit per phantasias; sed usque spiritus, contra 
quos ita phantasiis operantur, non aliter sciunt quam ut involvantur; hos quos sic involvebant, per petrae cujusdam declivitatem devolvere visum, sed qui involuti erant, eximebantur et liberabantur; 
erant spiritus qui non recedere volebant, ita a Domino conservati alioquin suffocati fuissent; tametsi revixissent, sed post cruciatum.  Recesserunt tunc per declivitatem petrae; inde auditus est 
sonus terebrosus, sicut multae terebrae magnae forent, et perceptum, quod essent crudelissimae eorum phantasiae contra Dominum ex quibus talis sonus: postea dejecti per cavernas tenebrosas sub nimbosa 
petra in infernum suum. Cum erant in mundo spirituum, mutabatur ibi constitutio sphaerae. </p>
