<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>780.</strong>“凡有生命之灵的血肉”表一个新造物，或它们从主接受新生命的事实。这一点从“血肉”的含义明显可知，“血肉”总体上表整个人类，具体表肉体人，如前所述。因此，“凡有生命之灵的血肉”表已重生之人，因为他的自我中心里面有主的生命，就是仁与信的生命。人只不过是“血肉”，但当仁与信的生命被主呼入他里面时，他的血肉就活了，变得属灵、属天，被称为一个“新造物”（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可16.15.htm">16:15</a>），因为他已被新造。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]780.</strong> The fact that of all flesh that had the breath of life in it means a newly created being, or the fact that they received new life from the Lord, is established by the symbolism of flesh as every person in general and a body-centered one in particular. This meaning with its proof was presented earlier [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_780/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_574" target=_top>574</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_780/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_661" target=_top>661</a>]. So flesh that has the breath of life in it symbolizes an individual reborn, since within such a person's sense of autonomy lies the Lord's life, which is the vital force of charity and faith.<br />None of us is anything but flesh, but when the Lord stirs in us the living quality of charity and faith, our flesh comes to life and becomes spiritual and heavenly. Then we are called a new creature (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_780/bible_king-james-version_mark_16_15" target=_top>Mark 16:15</a>){*1} because we have been created anew.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_780/bible_king-james-version_mark_16_15" target=_top>Mark 16:15</a> mentions "all creation" or "every creature." <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_780/bible_king-james-version_2-corinthians_5_17" target=_top>2 Corinthians 5:17</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_780/bible_king-james-version_galatians_6_15" target=_top>Galatians 6:15</a> speak of a "new creation" or "new creature."

Of all flesh wherein is the breath of lives. That this signifies a new creature, or that they received new life from the Lord, is evident from the signification of "flesh" as being in general all mankind, 
and specifically the corporeal man, as before said and shown. Hence "flesh wherein is the breath of lives" signifies a regenerated man, for in his Own there is the Lord's life, which is the life 
of charity and faith. Every man is only "flesh;" but when the life of charity and faith is breathed into him by the Lord, the flesh is made alive, and becomes spiritual and celestial, and is called a 
"new creature" (Mark 16:15), from having been created anew. </p>

'Of all flesh in which there was the spirit of life<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> means a new creature, or the fact that they received new life from the Lord. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'flesh' as all mankind in general 
and a bodily-minded person in particular, as stated and shown already. Consequently 'flesh in which there was the spirit of life'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> means a person who has been regenerated, for the Lord's life, which 
is the life of charity and faith, is there within his proprium. Nobody is anything more than flesh, but when the life of charity and faith is breathed into him by the Lord, his flesh in that case is 
made alive, becomes spiritual and celestial, and is called 'a new creature', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2016:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 16:15</a>, from having been created anew.

</p><b>780.</b>
Quod 'de omni carne, in qua spiritus novam creaturam, seu quod novam vitam acceperint a Domino, constare potest a significatione 'carnis' quod sit omnis homo in genere, et corporeus in specie, ut prius 
dictum et ostensum est; inde 'caro, in qua spiritus vitarum,' significat regeneratum; nam in proprio ejus est vita Domini, quae est vita charitatis et fidei: omnis homo non est nisi caro; sed cum 
vita charitatis et fidei ei a Domino inspiratur, tunc vivificatur caro, et fit spiritualis et caelestis, et vocatur nova creatura, Marc. xvi 15, ex eo quod e novo creatus. </p>
