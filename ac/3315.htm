<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3315节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3315.</strong>创世记25:29，30. 雅各熬汤，以扫从田野回来累昏了。以扫对雅各说，求你把这红的，这红的给我抿点，我累昏了；因此以扫起名叫以东。<br />“雅各熬汤”表积聚在一起的教义。“以扫从田野回来”表对生活良善的追求。“累昏了”表争战的状态。“以扫对雅各说”表主出于属世人的良善的直觉。“求你把这红的给我抿点”表对教义的渴望。“这红的”表看似良善之物。“我累昏了”在此和前面一样，表争战的状态。“因此以扫起名叫以东”表所产生良善的性质，真理的教义与这良善联结。</p>

Verses 29, 30. And Jacob boiled pottage, and Esau came from the field, and he was weary. And Esau said to Jacob, Cause me to sup I pray of the red, this red, for I am weary; therefore he called his name 
Edom. "And Jacob boiled pottage," signifies a chaotic mass of doctrinal things; "and Esau came from the field," signifies the pursuit of the good of life; "and he was weary," signifies a state of 
combat; "and Esau said to Jacob," signifies the Lord's perception from the good of the natural; "Cause me to sup I pray of the red," signifies a longing for doctrinal things; "this red," signifies that 
which is apparently good; "for I am weary," signifies here as before a state of combat; "therefore he called his name Edom," signifies his quality therefrom as to good, to which were adjoined the doctrinal 
things of truth. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3315</b></p><p><b>3315.</b>
Verses 29, 30 And Jacob boiled pottage; and Esau came from the field, and he was weary. And Esau said to Jacob, Let me sip now from the red [pottage], this red [pottage], for I am weary. Therefore he 
called his name Edom. </p>
<p>'Jacob boiled pottage' means matters of doctrine when massed together. 'And Esau came from the field' means an urgent desire for the good of life. 'And he was weary' means a 
state of conflict. 'And Esau said to Jacob' means the Lord's perception from the good of the natural. 'Let me sip now from the red [pottage]' means a desire for matters of doctrine. 'This red [pottage]' 
means that which is seemingly good. 'For I am weary' means here, as previously, a state of conflict. 'Therefore he called his name Edom' means the resulting nature of the good, to which matters of 
doctrine regarding truth were allied. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 3315</b>
</p><b>3315.</b>
Vers. 29, 30.  Et coxit Jacob pultem, et venit Esau de agro et is lassus. Et dixit Esau ad Jacobum, Fac mihi sorbere quaeso e rubro, rubrum hoc, quia lassus ego; propterea vocavit nomen ejus Edom. `Coxit 
Jacob pultem' significat doctrinalium congeriem: `et venit Esau de agro' significat studium boni vitae: `et is lassus' significat statum pugnae: `et dixit Esau ad Jacobum' significat perceptionem 
Domini ex bono naturalis: `Fac mihi sorbere quaeso e rubro' significat desiderium doctrinalium: `rubrum hoc' significat apparenter bonum: `quia lassus ego' significat, hic ut prius, statum pugnae: `propterea 
vocavit nomen ejus Edom' significat inde quale ejus quoad bonum, cui adjuncta doctrinalia veri. </p>
