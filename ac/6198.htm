<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6198节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6198.</strong>有些与我同在的灵人以为拥有生命的是他们，我只能从他们，不能从其它源头获得生命；因此，他们实际上就是我。但当他们被告知，他们是与我分开的单独灵人，并且就我的内层而言，我也是个灵人时，他们无法想法这一点。为叫他们知道这一点，他们被分开了，以这种方式被指示：他们是单独存在的灵人。但他们依旧不肯相信这一点，固执地坚持他们自己的观念。他们离开了一段时间，当他们回来时，他们的信念还是那样。这次经历也表明，灵人只知道这一点：属于人的东西是他们自己的。不过，像这样顽固坚持这类信仰的灵人不容易接近世人，因为他们很难与世人分开。诚然，类似的信念也被铭刻在其他所有灵人身上，好叫他们能为世人服务，但在他们身上却有所不同。</p>

There were spirits with me who supposed that it was they themselves who live, and that I had life from no other source than they, thus that they were I. But when they were told that they were separate 
spirits, and that I also was a spirit as to my interiors: this they could not believe. That they might know it, they were separated, and in this way it was shown that they were spirits by themselves. 
But still they were unwilling to believe, and were obstinately insistent. They went away for a time, and when they returned they were in the same persuasion. From this also it is evident that spirits 
know no otherwise than that the things appertaining to man are their own. But such as obstinately believe so are not readily admitted to men, because they cannot be separated without difficulty. A like 
persuasion is indeed impressed on all other spirits, to the intent that they may be of service to man, but with a difference. </p>

Some spirits were once present with me who imagined that it was they who had life and that the life I had came to me solely from them, so that they were in effect myself. But when they were told that 
they were spirits who existed separately from me, and that interiorly I too was a spirit they could not believe it. To enable them to know it, they were separated and in that way shown that they were 
spirits with a separate existence. But they still refused to believe it and stubbornly stuck to their own ideas. They went away for a while, and when they came back their conviction was still the same. 
This experience too shows that spirits know nothing different from this, that what exists with man is essentially theirs. But spirits like these who cling tenaciously to such beliefs are not afforded 
easy access to men because it is hard for them to be separated from men. A similar conviction has, it is true, been instilled into all other spirits to the end that they may be of service to men, but 
in them it is somewhat different. </p>

</p><b>6198.</b>
Fuerunt spiritus apud me qui putaverunt quod ipsi essent qui viverent et non mihi aliunde vita quam ab illis, sic ut illi essent ego; sed cum illis dictum est quod spiritus separati essent, et quod 
etiam ego essem spiritus quoad interiora, hoc non potuerunt credere; ut scirent, separati sunt et sic ostensum quod spiritus per se essent; sed usque non volebant credere, instabant pertinaciter; aberant 
per tempus, et cum redibant, in simili persuasione fuerunt.  Inde quoque constare potest quod spiritus non aliter sciant quam quod sua sint quae apud hominem.  Sed tales qui ita pertinaciter credunt, 
non admittuntur facile ad homines quia aegre possunt separari; simile quidem inditum est ceteris spiritibus ob causam ut inserviant homini, sed cum differentia.  </p>
