<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2891节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2891.</strong>从这个世界新来的灵人因试图理解以下观念而备受折磨：若不通过主，没有人能凭自己行出良善，或凭自己思想真理。他们以为如果这种观念是对的，他们就成了机器，什么也控制不了；若真是这样，那他们只能双手下垂，任自己被作用。但他们被告知，他们尽可以去思考，去意愿，去凭自己行善，并且也只有这样他们才能拥有天堂的自我和天上的自由。不过，他们也被告知，尽管如此，他们仍应承认善与真并非源于他们自己，而是源于主。他们得到指教说，所有天使都具有这样的承认，事实上具有这种直觉：事实的确如此。并且他们越敏锐地觉察到他们被主引领，因而在主里面，就越在自由里面。</p>

Spirits fresh from this world severely torment themselves by trying to comprehend how no one can do good of himself, or think truth of himself, except from the Lord; believing that thus they would be 
like machines, having no control of anything; and that if this is really so they should let their hands hang down, and suffer themselves to be acted upon. But they were told that they ought by all means 
to think, to will, and to do good of themselves; and that in no other way could they have an Own that is heavenly, and heavenly freedom; but that still they should acknowledge that the good and truth 
are not from them, but from the Lord: and they are instructed that all the angels are in such an acknowledgment, nay, in the perception that it is so; and the more exquisitely they perceive that they 
are led by the Lord, and thus are in the Lord, the more are they in freedom. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2891</b></p><p><b>2891.</b>
Those who have become spirits only recently torment themselves very much by trying to grasp the idea that no one is able to do good of himself, or to think what is true of himself, but that he does so 
from the Lord. For they believe that if that idea is true they would accordingly be like mere machines and have control of nothing at all; and that being so they would let hands hang down and allow 
themselves to be acted upon. But they are told that they ought by all means to think, to will, and to do good of themselves, and that in no other way could they have a heavenly proprium and heavenly freedom. 
But they are also told that they ought nevertheless to acknowledge that good and truth do not originate in themselves but in the Lord, and they are informed that such acknowledgement and indeed 
perception that this is so exists with all angels. And the more keenly they perceive that they are led by the Lord and so abide in Him the more they are in freedom. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2891</b>
</p><b>2891.</b>
Spiritus recentes maximopere se torquent, quomodo capiant quod nemo possit facere bonum a se, nec cogitare verum a se, sed a Domino, credentes quod sic forent sicut machinae nullius rei compotes, et 
si ita, quod remitterent manus et paterentur se agi:  sed illis dicitur quod omnino debeant cogitare, velle, et facere bonum a se, et quod aliter non habere possent proprium caeleste, et liberum caeleste; 
sed usque agnoscere quod bonum et verum non sit ab iis sed a Domino; et instruuntur quod in tali agnitione, immo in perceptione quod ita sit, omnes angeli sint; et quo exquisitius percipiunt se 
duci a Domino, et sic esse in Domino, quod eo magis in libero sint. </p>
