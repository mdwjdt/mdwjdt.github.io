<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5965节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5965.</strong>“来到迦南地他们的父亲雅各那里”表属世良善，而非属灵良善所住的地方。这从“迦南地”的含义和“雅各”的代表清楚可知：“迦南地”是指教会（<a href="3686.htm">3686</a>，<a href="3705.htm">3705</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="4517.htm">4517</a>，<a href="4736.htm">4736</a>节），因而是指那些代表教会的人所住的地方，众所周知，这些人就是雅各的后代；“雅各”是指属世良善（<a href="3305.htm">3305</a>，<a href="3659.htm">3659</a>，<a href="3775.htm">3775</a>，<a href="4009.htm">4009</a>，<a href="4073.htm">4073</a>，<a href="4234.htm">4234</a>，<a href="4538.htm">4538</a>节），不是指属灵良善，因为属灵良善由以色列来代表。“雅各”代表都会的外在，以色列代表教会的内在（参看<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>，<a href="4570.htm">4570</a>节）。无论是说属世良善，还是说教会的外在；无论说属灵良善，还是说教会的内在，意思都一样；因为属灵良善构成教会的外在，属灵良善构成教会的内在。<br />之所以用“属灵”这个词来描述处于天堂之光的事物，是因为处于这光的事物拥有在自己里面的对良善的情感和对真理的觉知。这种情感和觉知就使用这光，因为这光是从主来的。因此，拥有属灵良善与真理在自己里面的人就在教会的内在部分，因为他们的头在上面的天堂里面。之所以用“属世”这个词来描述处于尘世之光的事物，是因为处于这光的事物没有在自己里面的对良善的情感和对真理的觉知，只有在自己外面的。事实上，天堂之光流下来，在它周围，因而在它外面，而非在它里面光照；结果，人们之所以能知道良善是良善，或真理是真理，是因为人们说它是良善或真理，而不是因为他自己领悟到它是这样的。因此，只有属世良善在自己里面的人在教会的外在部分，因为他们的头不在天堂。相反，他们的头从天堂所领受的光是从外面来的。雅各在此之所以被称为雅各，而非以色列，就是因为他们处于外在，这从前面所述明显看出来。</p>

And came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father. That this signifies a dwelling where there was natural good but not spiritual good, is evident from the signification of the "land of Canaan," 
as being the church (n. 3686, 3705, 4447, 4517, 4736), thus the dwelling of those who represented the church, who, it is known, were the descendants of Jacob; and from the representation of Jacob, as 
being natural good (n. 3305, 3659, 3775, 4009, 4073, 4234, 4538), but not spiritual good, for this is represented by Israel (that Jacob represents the external of the church and Israel the internal, 
see n. 4286, 4570). Whether you say natural good, or the external of the church; and whether spiritual good, or the internal of the church, it is the same; for natural good constitutes the external of 
the church, and spiritual good the internal of the church. [2] That is called spiritual which is in the light of heaven, for that which is in this light has in it the affection of good and the perception 
of truth. These are in this light because this light is from the Lord; and therefore they who are in spiritual good and truth are in the internal of the church, for as to their heads they are within 
heaven. But that is called natural which is in the light of the world, and that which is in this light has no affection of good and perception of truth in itself, but out of itself; for the light 
of heaven flows in and illumines what is round about; thus what is without, not what is within; and causes good to be known as good and truth to be known as truth because it is so said, and not because 
it is perceived to be so; and therefore they who are in natural good are in the external of the church, for as to their heads they are not in heaven, but their heads are illumined thence from without. 
Jacob is now called "Jacob," not "Israel," for the reason that now they are in externals; as is plain from what has been said above. </p>

'And came to the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father' means the dwelling-place where natural but not spiritual good resides. This is clear from the meaning of 'the land of Canaan' as the Church, dealt 
with in <a href="3705.htm">3705</a>, <a href="3686.htm">3686</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="4517.htm">4517</a>, <a href="5136.htm">5136</a>, and so the dwelling-place of those who were to represent the Church, who were the descendants of Jacob, as is well known; and from the representation of 'Jacob' 
as natural good, dealt with in <a href="3305.htm">3305</a>, <a href="3659.htm">3659</a>, <a href="3775.htm">3775</a>, <a href="4009.htm">4009</a>, <a href="4073.htm">4073</a>, <a href="4234.htm">4234</a>, <a href="4538.htm">4538</a>, but not spiritual good since this is represented by 'Israel'. For the representation of 'Jacob' as the external aspect of the 
Church and of 'Israel' as the internal, see <a href="4186.htm">4186</a>, <a href="4570.htm">4570</a>. Whether you say natural good or the external aspect of the Church, and spiritual good or the internal aspect of the Church, it all amounts to 
the same since natural good constitutes the external aspect of the Church, and spiritual good the internal aspect of the Church. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The expression 'spiritual' is used to describe that which is in 
the light of heaven, for what is in that light has the affection for good and the perception of truth within itself. Such affection and perception make use of that light because that light comes from 
the Lord. People therefore who have spiritual good and truth within themselves are in the internal part of the Church, for their heads are up in heaven. But the expression 'natural' is used to describe 
that which is in the light of the world, for what is in this light does not have the affection for good or the perception of truth within itself, only outside itself. For the light of heaven flows down 
and shines round about it, thus outside it but not within it, with the result that the person can know that good is good or truth is truth because it is said to be good or truth but not because he 
perceives for himself that it is such. People therefore who have only natural good within themselves are in the external part of the Church, for their heads are not in heaven. Instead what light their 
heads receive from heaven comes from without. Jacob is called Jacob, not Israel, at this point for the reason that they are engrossed in external interests, as is plain from what has been stated above. </p>

`Et venerunt terram Canaan ad Jacobum patrem {1}suum': quod significet habitationem ubi bonum naturale non spirituale, constat ex significatione `terrae Canaanis' quod sit Ecclesia, de qua n. 3705, 
(x)3686, 4447, 4517, (x)5136, ita habitatio eorum qui repraesentarent Ecclesiam, qui quod fuerint posteri Jacobi, notum est; et ex repraesentatione `Jacobi' quod sit bonum naturale, de qua n. 3305, 3659, 
3775, 4009, 4073, 4234, 4538, non autem spirituale, nam hoc repraesentatur per `Israelem'; quod `Jacob' repraesentet externum Ecclesiae et `Israel' internum, videatur n. 4286, 4570; sive dicas bonum 
naturale {2}aut Ecclesiae externum, sive bonum spirituale aut Ecclesiae internum, idem est, nam bonum naturale constituit Ecclesiae externum, et bonum spirituale Ecclesiae internum. [2] (s)Spirituale 
dicitur quod {3}est in luce caeli, nam quod {3}est in illa luce, in se habet affectionem boni et perceptionem veri; hae{4} sunt in illa luce quia lux illa est a Domino; quapropter qui in bono et vero 
spirituali sunt, illi in interno Ecclesiae sunt, nam sunt capite intra caelum; naturale autem dicitur quod est {5}in luce mundi, et quod {6}in illa luce est, non in se habet affectionem boni et perceptionem 
veri sed extra se; influit enim lux caeli et illuminat circum circa, ita extra non intra, et facit ut sciatur quod bonum sit bonum et verum verum, quia ita dicitur, non quod ita esse percipiatur;(s) 
quapropter qui in bono {7} naturali sunt, illi in externo Ecclesiae sunt, {8}nam non capite sunt in caelo sed caput illuminatur inde ab extra. {9}Nunc Jacob vocatur Jacob, non Israel, ex causa 
quia nunc {10}in externis sunt, ut ab illis quae {11}supra dicta sunt, liquet. @1 See p 392, ft 3$ @2 sive . . . aut . . . seu$ @3 apparet$ @4 i enim$ @5 a$ @6 est a luce mundi$ @7 i et vero$ @8
