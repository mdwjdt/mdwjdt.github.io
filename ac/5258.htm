Verses 17-24. And Pharaoh spoke unto Joseph, In my dream behold I stood beside the bank of the river; and behold out of the river there came up seven kine, fat in flesh and beautiful in form, and they 
fed in the sedge; and behold seven other kine came up after them, thin and evil in form exceedingly, and lean in flesh, such as I have never seen in all the land of Egypt for badness; and the lean and 
evil kine did eat up the first seven fat kine, and they came to their inwards and it was not known that they had come to their inwards; and their look was bad as in the beginning. And I awoke. And 
I saw in my dream, and behold seven ears came up upon one stalk, fat and good; and behold seven ears, withered, thin, and parched with the east wind, sprung up after them; and the thin ears swallowed 
up the seven good ears; and I told it unto the magicians, and no one telleth it to me. "And Pharaoh spoke unto Joseph," signifies the thought of the celestial of the spiritual from the natural; "In my 
dream," signifies what was foreseen in obscurity; "behold I stood beside the bank of the river," signifies from boundary to boundary; "and behold out of the river," signifies that in the boundary; "there 
came up seven kine," signifies truths of the natural; "fat in flesh," signifies that were of charity; "and beautiful in form," signifies that were of faith thence; "and they fed in the sedge," signifies 
instruction; "and behold seven other kine came up after them," signifies falsities that were of the natural, near; "thin and evil in form exceedingly," signifies that were empty and of no faith; 
"and lean in flesh," signifies that neither were of charity; "such as I have never seen in all the land of Egypt for badness," signifies such as could in no way be conjoined with truths and goods; 
"and the lean and evil kine did eat up," signifies that falsities not of charity nor of faith banished; "the first seven fat kine," signifies the truths of faith from charity; "and they came to their 
inwards," signifies interior banishment; "and it was not known that they had come to their inwards," signifies that the truths of good were no longer perceived; "and their look was bad as in the beginning," 
signifies that there was nothing of communication and conjunction; "and I awoke," signifies a state of enlightenment; "and I saw in my dream," signifies what was further foreseen in obscurity; 
"and behold seven ears came up upon one stalk," signifies memory-knowledges that were of the natural, conjoined; "full and good," signifies to which the things of faith and charity could be applied; "and 
behold seven ears, withered, thin, and parched with the east wind," signifies memory-knowledges of no use and full of cupidities; "sprung up after them," signifies appearing near; "and the thin ears 
swallowed up the seven good ears," signifies that the memory-knowledges of no use banished those that were of use; "and I told it unto the magicians," signifies a consultation with interior memory-knowledges; 
"and no one telleth it to me," signifies that nothing was perceived from them. </p>

Verses 17-24 And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, In my dream, behold, I was standing on the bank of the river. And behold, out of the river seven cows were coming up, fat-fleshed and beautiful in form; and 
they fed in the sedge. And behold, seven other cows were coming up after them, weak and extremely bad in form and lean-fleshed; I have not seen any like them in all the land of Egypt for badness. And 
the lean and bad cows devoured the first seven fat cows. And they devoured them completely,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and no one would have known that they had devoured them completely;<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> and their appearance was malign, as it 
had been in the beginning. And I awoke. And I saw in my dream, and behold, seven heads of grain were coming up on one stalk, full and good. And behold, seven heads, dried up, thin, and scorched by an 
east wind, were sprouting after them. And the thin heads swallowed up the seven good heads. And I told it to the magi, and there was no one to point out the meaning to me. </p>
<p>'And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph' 
means thought expressed by the natural but belonging to the celestial of the spiritual. 'In my dream' means what has been foreseen in a state of obscurity. 'Behold, I was standing on the bank of 
the river' means from boundary to boundary. 'And behold, out of the river' means at the boundary. 'Seven cows were coming up' means the truths belonging to the natural. 'Fat-fleshed' means which were 
embodiments of charity. 'And beautiful in form' means which were expressions of faith resulting from these. 'And they fed in the sedge' means instruction. 'And behold, seven other cows were coming up 
after them' means falsities present in the natural close by them. 'Weak and extremely bad in form' means empty and lacking in faith. 'And lean-fleshed' means lacking in charity too. I have not seen 
anything like them in all the land of Egypt for badness' means which were such that they could not by any means be joined to forms of truth and good. 'And the lean and bad cows devoured.....' means that 
falsities which were not expressions of faith and not embodiments of charity would banish.....'The first seven fat cows' means truths which were expressions of faith derived from charity. 'And they 
devoured them completely' means an interior banishing. 'And no one would have known that they had devoured them completely' means that the truths of good were no longer discernible. 'And their appearance 
was malign, as it had been at the beginning' means that no communication or joining together existed. 'And I awoke' means a state of enlightenment. 'And I saw in my dream' means still more foreseen 
in obscurity. 'And behold, seven heads of grain were coming up on one stalk' means facts known to the natural, which facts existed linked together. 'Full and good' means into which facts matters of 
faith and charity could be instilled. 'And behold, seven heads, dried up, thin, and scorched by an east wind' means facts that are useless and full of evil desires. 'Were sprouting after them' means 
appearing close by them. 'And the thin heads swallowed up the seven good heads' means that the facts which were useless banished the facts which were useful. 'And I told it to the magi' means a consultation 
with facts of an interior kind. 'And there was no one to point out the meaning to me' means that nothing at all was discerned from these.

Vers. 17-24.  Et locutus Pharaoh ad Josephum, In somnio meo, ecce me stantem juxta ripam fluvii. Et ecce e fluvio ascendentes septem vaccae pingues carne et pulchrae forma, et pascebant in ulva.  Et 
ecce septem vaccae aliae ascendentes post eas, tenues et malae forma valde, et macilentae carne; non vidi sicut eas in omni terra Aegypti quoad malignitatem. Et comederunt vaccae macilentae et malae 
septem vaccas priores pingues. Et venerunt ad viscera earum, et non cognitum quod venerint ad viscera earum, et aspectus earum malignus quemadmodum in initio; et expergefactus sum. Et vidi in somnio meo, 
et ecce septem aristae ascendentes in calamo uno, plenae et bonae. Et ecce septem aristae aridae, graciles et exustae euro, germinantes post illas. Et absorpserunt aristae graciles septem aristas 
bonas: et dixi ad magos, et nemo indicans mihi. `Et locutus Pharaoh ad Josephum' significat {1}cogitationem caelestis spiritualis e naturali: `In somnio meo' significat praevisum in obscuro: `ecce me 
stantem juxta ripam fluvii' significat a termino ad terminum: `et ecce e fluvio' significat quod in termino: `ascendentes septem vaccae' significat vera naturalis: `pingues carne' significat quae charitatis: 
`et pulchrae forma' significat quae fidei inde: `et pascebant in ulva' significat instructionem: `et ecce septem vaccae aliae ascendentes post eas' significat falsa quae naturalis juxta: `tenues 
et malae forma valde' significat quae vana et nullius fidei: `et macilentae carne' significat quae nec charitatis: `non vidi sicut eas in omni terra Aegypti quoad malignitatem' significat talia quae 
nullo modo cum veris et bonis conjungi possent: `et comederunt vaccae macilentae et malae' significat quod falsa quae non charitatis et non fidei exterminarent: `septem vaccas priores pingues' significat 
vera quae fidei ex charitate: `et venerunt ad viscera earum' significat exterminationem interiorem: `et non cognitum quod venerint ad viscera earum' significat quod vera boni non amplius appercepta: 
et aspectus earum malignus quemadmodum in initio' significat quod nihil communicationis et conjunctionis:  `et expergefactus sum' significat illustrationis statum: `et vidi in somnio meo' significat 
adhuc praevisum in obscuro: `et ecce septem aristae ascendentes in calamo uno' significat scientifica quae naturalis, conjuncta: `plenae et bonae' significat quibus illa quae fidei et charitatis inapplicari 
possent: `et ecce septem aristae aridae, graciles, et exustae euro' significat scientifica nullius usus et plena cupiditatum: `germinantes post illas' significat apparentes juxta: `et absorpserunt 
aristae graciles septem aristas bonas' significat quod scientifica nullius usus exterminarent scientifica usus: `et dixi ad magos' significat consultationem cum scientificis interioribus: `et 
nemo indicans mihi' significat quod ex illis nihil apperceptum.  @1 cognitionem I$ </p>
