<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6193.</strong>由于灵人以这种方式占有形成一个人的思维和意愿的一切，天使则占有还要更内层的事物，以便此人与他们有最紧密的结合，所以这个人无法回避这样的觉知和感受：那在思考和意愿的，正是他自己。因为在来世，一切交流都具有这样的性质：在一个容纳相似灵人的社群，每个灵人都以为别人的东西是他自己的。因此，当善人进入天上的社群时，他们立刻进入该社群的一切聪明和智慧，并且进入得如此充分，以致他们只知道这些事物就存在于他们自己里面。一个人，以及与他同在的一个灵人也是如此。从来自地狱的灵人那里所流入的东西是邪恶与虚假，而从来自天堂的天使那里所流入的东西则是良善与真理。于是，通过这两种彼此对立的流注，人被保持在中间，从而处于自由。<br />由于从天使所流入的东西，都是经由人的更内层部分流入的，所以它们不像从恶灵所流入的东西那样容易被外在感觉辨识。此外，天使具有这样的性质：他们从来不愿听见说，良善与真理是从他们自己那里流入的，只愿听见说，它们来自主。若有别的任何想法，他们就会愤慨，因为他们有一种非常清晰的觉知，即：这是事实。他们最喜欢的，莫过于他们的意愿和思维并非始于他们自己，而是始于主。另一方面，恶灵若被告知，他们的思维和意愿并非始于他们自己，就会恼怒，因为这种观念违背他们的爱之快乐。当被告知，生命并不在他们里面，而是流入他们时，他们更加愤怒。当这一点通过活生生的经历被展示给这些灵人，并且这种展示多次发生时，他们的确坦承这是事实，因为他们说不出违反经历的话来；但过了一段时间，他们否认了这一点，而且不愿再通过经历来证明。</p>

As in this way spirits possess all things of a man's thought and will, and angels things which are still more interior, and as the man is thus most closely conjoined with them, therefore the man must 
necessarily perceive and feel that it is he himself who thinks and wills; for the communications in the other life are of such a nature that in a society containing similar spirits each one believes 
that to be his own which is another's. And therefore when the good come into heavenly society, they at once enter into all the intelligence and wisdom of that society, insomuch that they know no otherwise 
than that these are in themselves. And such also is the case with a man, and with a spirit who is attendant upon him. The things which flow in from the spirits who are from hell are evils and falsities, 
but those which flow in from the angels who are from heaven are goods and truths. Thus by means of influxes opposite to each other the man is kept in the midst, thus in freedom. As the things 
which flow in from the angels, flow in through the more inward interiors, they are not so apparent to the outward sense as are those which flow in from evil spirits. Moreover the angels are of such a 
character that they never desire to hear that the influxes of good and truth are from themselves, but that they are from the Lord, and they are indignant if it is thought otherwise; for they are in the 
manifest perception that it is so, and they love nothing more than to will and think not from themselves, but from the Lord. On the other hand, evil spirits are angry if told that they do not think 
and will from themselves, because this is contrary to the delight of their loves; and they are more angry when told that life is not in them, but that it flows in. When this is shown them by experience 
to the life, which has often been done, they then indeed confess that it is so, for they cannot speak contrary to experience; but still after some delay they deny it, and then they are not willing that 
it should be any further confirmed by experience. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6193</b></p><p><b>6193.</b>
Since spirits take possession in that way of all that forms a person's thought and will, and angels take possession of what is even more interior, so that he is joined very closely to them, the person 
cannot avoid the perception and sensation that he himself is the one who thinks and wills. For the nature of all communication in the next life is this: In a community in which people are alike, each 
thinks that what is another's is his own. When therefore people who are good go into a heavenly community they instantly enter into all the intelligence and wisdom of that community, entering into it 
so fully that they know no other than that such things exist within themselves. This is also how it is with man and a spirit present with him. The things that flow in from spirits from hell are evil 
and false, but those which flow in from angels from heaven are good and true; and through these opposite kinds of influx a person is held in the middle, thus in freedom. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 Because what flows in 
from angels comes through the more interior parts of a person, it is less easily recognized by outward sensation than that which flows in from evil spirits. Also, the angels are by nature such that they 
will not hear of goodness and truth flowing in from themselves, only of its coming from the Lord. They are indignant at the thought of anything different; for they have a very clear perception that 
that is the truth of the matter, and there is nothing they like more than for their desires and thoughts to begin not in themselves but in the Lord. Evil spirits on the other hand are angry ii they are 
told that their thoughts and desires do not begin in themselves, because that idea is contrary to what their loves lead them to be delighted with. And they are all the more angry when they are told 
that life does not exist independently in them but flows into them. This is demonstrated to those spirits through actual experience; and such demonstration takes place many times, when they do indeed 
confess that such is the truth, since they cannot speak contrary to experience. But after a while they deny it and have no wish to have it proved any more from experience. </p>

</p><b>6193.</b>
Quia spiritus ita possident omnia quae cogitationis et voluntatis hominis sunt, et angeli quae adhuc interiora sunt, et sic homo illis conjunctissimus est, idcirco homo non aliter appercipere et sentire 
potest quam quod ipse sit qui cogitat et vult; se enim ita habet cum communicationibus in altera vita; in societate ubi similes, quisque credit esse suum quod est alterius; quapropter boni cum in 
societatem caelestem veniunt, ilico in omnem intelligentiam et sapientiam illius societatis intrant usque adeo ut non aliter sciant quam quod illa in se sint; ita quoque se habet cum homine et cum spiritu 
apud illum.  Quae a spiritibus ab inferno influunt, sunt mala et falsa, at quae ab angelis e caelo, sunt bona et vera; ita per influxus sibi oppositos tenetur homo in medio, ita in libero.  [2]Quae 
influunt ab angelis, quia per interiora magis, non ita ad sensum externum apparent sicut quae a malis spiritibus.  Angeli etiam sunt tales ut nequaquam audire velint quod influxus boni et veri sint 
a se, sed quod sint a Domino; indignantur si cogitatur aliter, nam illi sunt in perceptione manifesta quod ita sit, et nihil plus amant quam quod non a se velint et cogitent sed a Domino; at vicissim 
mali spiritus irascuntur si illis dicitur quod non cogitent et velint ex se, quia hoc est contra jucundum amorum illorum; et magis cum dicitur quod vita non sit in illis sed quod influat; hoc cum illis 
per vivam experientiam ostenditur, quod saepe factum est, tunc quidem fatentur quod ita sit; nam loqui contra experientiam non possunt, at usque post aliquam moram negant, nec tunc volunt ut id amplius 
confirmetur ab experientia. </p>
