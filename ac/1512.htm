<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1512.</strong>幻觉的气场当呈为可见时，则看似云团，其厚度取决于幻觉的性质。左脚下有一种雾石，洪水前的灵人生活在那里，他们就住在那雾石下面。那幽暗是由他们的幻觉产生的，他们在此与来世的其他灵人保持分离。那些生活在仇恨和报复中的人所放射的气场能使人昏厥和呕吐。这类气场可以说是有毒的。凭着暗蓝般的条纹就能测试出它们的毒性和厚度；随着这些条纹褪去，这气场也会逐渐减弱。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1512.</strong> When hallucinatory auras present themselves to view, they look like clouds, thicker or thinner according to the nature of the hallucination. There is a kind of foggy crag under the left foot in the region of the pre-Flood people, and they spend their lives beneath it.{*1} Its fogginess is due to their hallucinations and keeps them at a distance from everyone else in the other world.<br />People who have lived lives of hatred and revenge give off auras of a type that causes fainting and induces vomiting. These auras are essentially poisonous. They are usually tested for their toxicity and density by means of a kind of dusky blue strip. As these strips disappear, the aura also shrinks.{*2} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For more on this foggy crag and the hell associated with it, see 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1512/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1266" target=_top>1266-1268</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1512/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1270#subsection-2-3" target=_top>1270:3</a>. [LHC]<br />{*2} Two brief passages in Swedenborg's Spiritual Experiences (Swedenborg 1998-2002) apparently refer to this same phenomenon without offering much more information on exactly how it works. One is 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1512/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3379" target=_top>3379</a>, which says, referring to the pre-Flood people, "Afterward, the aura was in some part poisoned by their delusions. The extent and character of the aura was represented by a long thread with intermittent blue coloring and the way the thread would disappear." The other is 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1512/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3395" target=_top>3395</a>: "I was shown once more that the aura of delusions generated by some of the evil people of that ancient church was measured by dipping a blue strip into it and seeing how much of it vanished." The earthly parallel that immediately comes to mind is a strip of litmus paper. The testing of acidity by the application of litmus, a blue dye extracted from lichens, dates back to at least 1300 c.e., though its first use on a strip of cloth or paper is not well attested.

The spheres of phantasies, when presented in visible form, appear like clouds, more or less dense according to the quality of the phantasy. There is a certain misty rock under the left foot, where the 
antediluvians are, and under which they stay. That cloudiness, by which they are kept apart from all others in the other life, arises from their phantasies. From those who have lived in hatred and revenge, 
there exhale such spheres as cause swooning, and excite vomiting. Such spheres are as it were poisonous; and it is usual to test how poisonous they are, and how dense, by fillets of a dull azure 
color: as these fade away, the sphere also is lessened. </p>

When the spheres of delusions are manifested visually they are seen as clouds, varying in density according to the nature of the delusion. There is a certain rock covered in mist beneath the left foot 
where certain spirits who lived before the Flood belong, and beneath which they remain. That mistiness arises out of their delusions, and here they are kept well away from all others in the next life. 
From those who have led lives of hatred and revenge such spheres emanate as cause fainting or vomiting. Such spheres are so to speak poisonous. Just how poisonous they are and how dense is usually 
ascertained by means of what look like dark bluish streaks which fade away as the spheres decrease. </p>

</p><b>1512.</b>
Sphaerae phantasiarum cum sistuntur videndae, apparent sicut nubes, secundum phantasiae qualitatem, magis et minus densae: est nimbosa quaedam petra sub pede sinistro ubi antediluviani, sub qua degunt; 
nimbosum illud oritur ex phantasiis illorum, quo distinentur ab omnibus ceteris in alter vita.  Ex illis qui in odio et vindictis vixerunt, exhalant tales sphaerae ut deliquium causentur, utque vomitum 
excitent: sphaerae tales sunt quasi venenatae; quae quantum venenatae, et quam crassae explorari solet per quasi fascias obscure caeruleas; ut hae evanescunt, etiam sphaera diminuitur. </p>
