<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>489.</strong>“众子和众女”表他们直觉到的真理与良善；事实上，“众子”表真理，“众女”表良善。这从先知书的很多经文清楚看出。在圣言中如古时那样，教会的怀孕和出生被称为“众子和众女”，如以赛亚书。<br />万国要来就你的光，君王要来就你发现的光辉；你举目向四方观看；众人都聚集来到你这里；你的众子从远方来，你的众女也被怀抱而来；那时，你看见就有光荣，你心又跳动又宽畅。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.3.htm">60:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.5.htm">5</a>）<br />上述经文中的“众子”表真理，“众女”表良善。<br />诗篇：<br />求你救拔我，救我脱离外邦人的众子之手，他们的口说谎话。我们的儿子从幼年好像树栽子长大，我们的女儿如同殿角石，是按建殿宇的样式凿成的。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗144.11.htm">144:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗144.12.htm">12</a>）<br />“外邦人的众子”表伪真理，或虚假；“我们的儿子“表真理的教义；“我们的女儿”表良善的教义。<br />③以赛亚书：<br />我要对北方说：“交出来！”对南方说：“不要扣留！“将我的众子从远方带来，将我的众女从地极领回；要将瞎眼的带出来，他们必将有眼；将耳聋的带出来，他们必将有耳。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛43.6.htm">43:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛43.8.htm">8</a>）<br />上述经文里的“众子”表真理；“众女”表良善；“瞎眼的”表那些将要看见真理的人；“耳聋的”表那些将要顺服真理的人。<br />④在耶利米书：<br />从我们幼年以来，羞耻将我们列祖所劳碌得来的羊群、牛群，和他们的儿女都吞吃了。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶3.24.htm">3:24</a>）<br />这里的“儿女”表真理和良善。在下面以赛亚书经文中，“男孩”与“众子”表示真理：<br />雅各必不再羞愧，他的脸容也不再变为苍白；因为他看见他的男孩，就是我手的工作；在他中间，他们必尊我的名为圣，必尊雅各的圣者为圣，必敬畏以色列的神；灵里迷糊的必得明白。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛29.22.htm">29:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛29.24.htm">24</a>）<br />“雅各的圣者，以色列的神”表示主；“男孩”表示重生者，他们拥有对善与真的觉知，如所显明的那样。<br />⑤同一先知书：<br />你这不怀孕、不生养的，你要歌唱！因为荒凉者的众子比已婚者的更多。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛54.1.htm">54:1</a>）<br />“荒凉者（the desolate）的众子”表初期教会或外邦人教会的真理；而“已婚者的众子”则表犹太教会的真理。<br />⑥耶利米书：<br />我的帐棚毁坏，我的绳索折断；我的众子离我出去，没有了。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶10.20.htm">10:20</a>）<br />这里的“众子”表示真理。同一先知书：<br />他的众子要如往日，他们的会众竖立在我面前。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶30.20.htm">30:20</a>）<br />这里的“众子”表古教会（the Ancient Church）的真理。在撒迦利亚书：<br />我要激发你的众子，锡安哪，与你的众子一起，雅各哪，使你如勇士的刀剑。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚9.13.htm">9:13</a>）<br />这里的“众子”表内含爱的信之真理。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]489.</strong> The symbolism of sons and daughters as the truth and goodness that this church perceived — sons being the truth and daughters the goodness — can be seen from many places in the prophets. The things conceived and born in the church are called daughters and sons in the Word, just as they were in ancient times. An example from Isaiah:<br />The nations will walk toward your light, and monarchs, toward the radiance of your dawn. Raise your eyes all around and see: they all gather and come to you. Your sons will come from far away and your daughters will be nourished at your side. Then you will see and flow toward them, and your heart will be struck with awe and expand. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_489/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_60_3-4" target=_top>Isaiah 60:3-4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_489/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_60_5" target=_top>5</a>)<br />The sons stand for truth, and the daughters, for good. In David:<br />Free me and rescue me from the hand of a foreigner's sons, whose mouth speaks hollow words. Our sons are like plantings grown large in their youthful days; our daughters are like corner pieces cut in the shape of the Temple. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_489/bible_king-james-version_psalms_144_11-12" target=_top>Psalms 144:11-12</a>)<br />A foreigner's sons stand for pseudo-truths, that is, falsities. "Our" sons stand for doctrinal concepts concerning truth; daughters, for doctrinal concepts concerning good. In Isaiah:<br />I will say to the north, "Hand them over!" and to the south, "Do not hinder them! Bring my sons from far away and my daughters from the end of the earth, leading forth a blind people (and they will have eyes) and the deaf (and they will have ears)." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_489/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_43_6" target=_top>Isaiah 43:6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_489/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_43_8" target=_top>8</a>)<br />The sons stand for truth, and the daughters, for good; the blind, for those who will see truth, and the deaf, for those who submit to it. In Jeremiah:<br />Shame has devoured our fathers' toil from our youth — their smaller livestock, their herd, their sons, and their daughters. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_489/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_3_24" target=_top>Jeremiah 3:24</a>)<br />The sons and daughters stand for truth and good.<br />[2] To see that sons stand for truth, look in Isaiah:<br />No longer will Jacob be ashamed and no longer will his face pale. Because when he sees his sons — the work of my hands — in his midst, they will revere my name and revere the Holy One of Jacob, and the God of Israel they will dread. Those wandering in spirit will know intelligence. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_489/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_29_22-23" target=_top>Isaiah 29:22-23</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_489/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_29_24" target=_top>24</a>)<br />The Holy One of Jacob, the God of Israel, stands for the Lord. The sons stand for regenerate people, who will gain an intelligent understanding of goodness and truth, as these words also explain. In the same author:<br />Sing, infertile woman (she had not given birth), because the sons of the desolate one are more numerous than the sons of the married one. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_489/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_54_1" target=_top>Isaiah 54:1</a>)<br />The sons of the desolate one stand for the truth known to the early church (the church among non-Jews) and the sons of the married one for the truth known to the Jewish church. In Jeremiah:<br />My tent was devastated and all my ropes were torn out; my sons went away from me and were no more. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_489/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_10_20" target=_top>Jeremiah 10:20</a>)<br />The sons stand for truth. In the same author:<br />His sons will be as they once were, and their assembly will be established before me. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_489/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_30_20" target=_top>Jeremiah 30:20</a>)<br />Here they stand for the truth known to the ancient church. In Zechariah:<br />I will stir up your sons, Zion, along with your sons, Javan, and I will make you like the sword of a mighty man. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_489/bible_king-james-version_zechariah_9_13" target=_top>Zechariah 9:13</a>)<br />Here they stand for truth from a loving faith. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 489</b></p><p><b>489.</b>
That by "sons and daughters" are signified the truths and goods which they had a perception of, and indeed by "sons" truths, and by "daughters" goods, is evident from many passages in the Prophets; for 
in the Word, as also in olden time, the conceptions and births of the church are called "sons and daughters" as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of 
thy rising; lift up thine eyes round about and see; all they gather themselves together and come to thee; thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side; then thou shalt 
see and flow together, and thy heart shall be amazed, and shall be enlarged (Isa. 60:3-5), in which passage "sons" signify truths, and "daughters" goods.      [2] In David: </p>
<p>     Deliver me and rescue 
me from the hand of the sons of the stranger, whose mouth speaketh vanity; that our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth, that our daughters may be as corner-stones hewn in the form of a temple 
(Ps. 44:11-12), where the "sons of the stranger" signify spurious truths, or falsities; "our sons" signify doctrinals of truth; "our daughters" doctrinals of good.  [3] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     I will 
say to the north, Give up, and to the south, Keep not back; bring My sons from far, and My daughters from the ends of the earth; bring forth the blind people, and they shall have eyes; the deaf, and they 
shall have ears (Isa. 43:6, 8), in which passage "sons" signify truths; "daughters" goods; the "blind" those who would see truths; and the "deaf" those who would obey them.  [4] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>  
   Shame hath devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth; their flocks, their herds, their sons, and their daughters (Jer. 3:24), where "sons" and "daughters" signify truths and goods. That "children" 
and "sons" signify truths, is plain from Isaiah:     Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale; for when he shall see his children the work of My hands in the midst of 
him, they shall sanctify My name, and shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel; they also that erred in spirit shall know understanding (Isa. 29:22-24), where the "Holy 
One of Jacob, the God of Israel" signifies the Lord; "children" signify the regenerate, who have the understanding of good and truth, as is indeed explained.  [5] Again: </p>
<p>     Sing, O barren, thou 
that didst not bear, for more are the sons of the desolate than the sons of the married wife (Isa. 54:1), where the "sons of the desolate" signify the truths of the primitive Church, or that of the Gentiles; 
the "sons of the married wife" the truths of the Jewish Church.  [6] In , Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     My tent is laid waste and all My cords are plucked out; My sons are gone forth of Me, and are not (Jer. 
10:20), where "sons" signify truths. Again: </p>
<p>     His sons shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before Me (Jer. 30:20), where "sons" signify the truths of the Ancient 
Church. In Zechariah: </p>
<p>     I will stir up thy sons, O Zion, with thy sons, O Javan, and make thee as the sword of a mighty man (Zech. 9:13), signifying the truths of the faith of love. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 489</b></p><p><b>489.</b>
'Sons and daughters' means the truths and goods which they perceived, 'sons to be exact meaning the truths and 'daughters' the goods. This becomes clear from very many places in the Prophets. For in 
the Word, as happened in earliest times, conceptions and births of the Church are called 'sons and daughters', as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Nations will walk to your light, and kings to the brightness of your rising. 
Lift up your eyes round about and see; they all gather and they come towards you. Your sons will come from far, and your daughters will be nursed at your side. Then you will see and abound, and your 
heart will be astounded and enlarged. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2060:3-5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 60:3-5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'sons' stands for truths and 'daughters' for goods. In David,  </p>
<blockquote>
Rescue me and snatch me from the hand of sons of the foreigner, whose mouths 
speak lies. Our sons are like plants made large in their youth, our daughters like corner-pillars cut in the form of the temple. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20144:11,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 144:11, 12</a>.   
</blockquote>
'Sons of the foreigner' stands for spurious truths, 
which are falsities, 'our sons' for matters of doctrine concerning truth, and 'daughters' for matters of doctrine concerning good. In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, 
Do not withhold. Bring My sons from afar and My daughters from the end of the earth. Bring forth the blind people, and they will have eyes, and the deaf, who will have ears <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2043:6,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 43:6, 8</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 
'sons' stands for truths, 'daughters' for goods, 'the blind' for people who will see truths, and 'the deaf' for those who comply with them. In Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
From our youth shame is devouring the work 
of our fathers - their flocks, their herds, their sons, and their daughters. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%203:24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 3:24</a>.   
</blockquote>
Here 'sons and daughters' stands for truths and goods.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 'Male children' and 'sons' stand for truths 
in the following in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jacob will no more be ashamed, and no more will his face grow pale. For when he sees his male children, the work of My hands, in his midst they will sanctify My name, and 
they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob and stand in awe of the God of Israel. Those who err in spirit will know understanding <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2029:12--24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 29:12--24</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The Holy One of Jacob, the God of Israel' stands 
for the Lord, 'male children' for regenerate people who have an understanding of good and truth, as is also explicitly stated. In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
Sing, O barren one, who did not bear, for the sons 
of her that is desolate are more than the suns of her that is married. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2054:1%20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 54:1 </a> 
</blockquote>
<p>'The sons of her that is desolate' stands for truths of the Primitive Church, or Church among gentiles, while 'the 
sons of her that is married' stands for truths of the Jewish Church. In Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
My tent has been laid waste, and all My cords torn away; My sons have gone away from Me, and they are not. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2010:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 10:20</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Sons' stands for truths. In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
Their suns will be as they were of old, and their congregation will be established before Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2030:10%20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 30:10 </a> 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'sons' stands for the truths 
of the Ancient Church. In Zechariah,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will rouse your sons, O Zion, together with your sons, O Jehovah, and I will set you as the sword of one who is powerful. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%209:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 9:13</a>. 
</blockquote>
Here 'sons' stands 
for truths of faith inherent in love.  </p>

Quod per 'filios et filias' significentur vera et bona qua perceperunt, et quidem per 'filios' vera et per 'filias' bona, e: permultis locis apud Prophetas constare potest; conceptus enim et partus 
Ecclesiae in Verbo, sicut antiquitus, nominati sunt filii et filiae, ut apud Esaiam, 	Ambulabunt gentes ad lucem tuam, et reges ad splendorem ortus tui, attolle circumcirca oculos tuos, et vide, omnes 
ii congregantur, et veniunt ad te, filii tui e longinquo venient, et filiae tua ad latus nutrientur; tunc videbis et afflues; et stupebit, et dilatabit se cor tuum, lx 3-5; </p>
<p>ubi 'filii' pro veris, et 
'filiae' pro bonis: apud Davidem, 	Libera me et eripe me e manu filiorum alienigenae, quorum os loquitur vanitatem;... filii nostri sicut plantationes magnae factae in pueritiis suis, filiae nostrae 
sicut anguli, excisi forma templi, Ps. cxliv 11, 12; </p>
<p>'filii alienigenae' pro veris spuriis seu falsis, 'filii nostri' pro doctrinalibus veri, 'filiae' pro doctrinalibus boni: apud Esaiam, 	Dicam septentrioni, 
Da; et austro, Ne inhibe; adduc filio Meos e longinquo, et filias Meas ab extremitate terrae,... 	educens populum caecum, et oculi ei erunt; et surdos, et aures eis, xliii 6,8; </p>
<p>ibi 'filii' 
pro veris, 'filiae' pro bonis, 'caeci' pro iis qui videbunt vera, 'surdi' pro iis qui obtemperant: apud Jeremiam, 	Pudor comedit laborem patrum nostrorum a pueritiis nostris, pecus eorum, armentum 
eorum, filios eorum, et filias {x}eorum, iii 24; </p>
<p>ibi 'filii et filiae' pro veris et bonis.  [2] Quod nati et filii pro veris, apud Esaiam, 	Non jam pudefiet Jacobus, et non jam facies ejus pallescent; 
quia cum videbit ille natos suos, opus manuum Mearum, in medio ejus sanctificabunt nomen Meum, et 	sanctificabunt Sanctum Jacobi, Deumque Israelis formidabunt, scient errantes spiritu intelligentiam, 
xxix 22-24; </p>
<p>'Sanctus Jacobi, Deus Israelis' pro Domino, 'nati' pro regeneratis, quibus intelligentia boni et veri, ut quoque explicatur:  apud eundem, 	Canta sterilis, non pepererat, quia multi 
filii desolatae prae filiis maritatae, liv 1; </p>
<p>'filii desolatae' pro veris Ecclesiae primitivae seu gentium, 'filii maritatae' pro veris Ecclesiae Judaicae: apud Jeremiam, 	Tentorium Meum devastatum

Antiquae: apud Zachariam, </p>
<p>	Excitabo filios tuos Zion, cum filiis tuis Javan, et 	ponam te sicut gladium potentis, ix 13; </p>
