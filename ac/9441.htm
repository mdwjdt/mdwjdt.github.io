<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9441节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9441.</strong>谁都能从以下事实看出大量世界的存在，即：如此多的星辰天体遍布天空；在学术界，众所周知，每颗恒星都像一轮在自己本位的太阳，因为它像我们地球太阳在其本位那样保持固定不变；但距离使它看上去很小，就像一颗星星或一个光点；因此，和我们太阳系的太阳一样，它也有绕它旋转的行星或星球。具有众多星座、如此浩瀚的星空为何存在呢？宇宙被造并存在的目的就是人类；以便一个天使天堂能由人类形成。不过，对无限的创造者来说，仅仅一个星球上的人类，以及由它所形成的天使天堂有什么用呢？对祂来说，成千，不，上万个星球都不够。下面计算一下：假如宇宙中有一百万个星球，每个星球上有三亿人，在六千年内生育两百代人，并且每个人占三立方米的空间，把这些人都聚到一个地方，其总数连这个星球千分之一的空间都填不满，因而连木星或土星的一个卫星的空间都不到。他们所充满的空间在宇宙中太小了，以至于很难看得见；因为肉眼几乎看不见这些卫星。这对宇宙的创造者来说有什么用呢？对祂来说，整个宇宙都填满也不够，因为祂是无限的。我曾与天使谈论这个话题，他们说，对于相对创造者的无限来说人类的稀少，他们持有类似观念；不过，他们不是出于空间，而是出于状态来思考的；按照他们的观念，极尽所能想象出的无数星球相对于主来说，仍如同完全没有。此外，他们还说，人类是天使天堂的苗床，天使天堂就对应于人里面的一切事物；这样一个天堂不可能仅由来自一个星球的天使建成，必须由来自无数星球的天使建成。</p>

Everyone can see that there are many worlds, from the fact that so many stars appear in the universe, and it is known in the learned world that every star is like a sun in its own place, for it remains 
fixed as the sun of our earth does in its place; and that the distance causes it to appear in a small form like a star; consequently that, like the sun of our system, it has planets revolving around 
it, which are earths. For what else could there be so great a heaven with so many stars? For the end of the creation of the universe is man; in order that from man there may be an angelic heaven. But 
what would mankind and an angelic heaven from one single earth be for the infinite Creator, for whom a thousand earths, nay, tens of thousands of them, would not suffice? A calculation has been made, 
that if there were in the universe one million earths, and on every earth three hundred million men, and two hundred generations within six thousand years, and that to every man there was allotted a 
space of three cubic ells, the sum of so many men collected into one mass would not occupy a space equal to a thousandth part of this earth; thus not the space of one of the satellites of Jupiter or 
Saturn; which would be a space in the universe too small to be seen; for any satellite of Jupiter or Saturn is barely visible to the naked eye. And what would this be for the Creator of the universe, 
to whom the whole universe, if so filled up, would not suffice; for He is infinite. In speaking on this subject with the angels, they said that they have a similar idea concerning the fewness of the human 
race relatively to the infinity of the Creator; but that still they do not think from spaces, but from states; and that according to their idea, supposing the number of earths to be as many myriads 
as could possibly be conceived of in thought, they would still be absolutely nothing to the Lord; moreover, that the angelic heaven, of which the human race is the seminary, corresponds to all things 
that are in man; and that   such a heaven cannot be built up of angels from one earth, but only from innumerable earths. </p>

The existence of a large number of worlds may be evident to anyone from the fact that so many heavenly bodies appear throughout the sky; that each one, as is well known in the learned world, resembles 
the sun in its own place, since each remains fixed in the same way as our planet's sun does in its own place, but that distance causes it to be seen as something small, as a point of light; and that 
consequently each has planets or earths around it in the same way as the sun of our world has. Why else does so vast a sky with so many constellations exist? The whole reason why the universe has been 
created and exists is mankind, from whom an angelic heaven may be formed. But what would the human race on only one planet be, and what would the angelic heaven formed from it be for the Infinite Creator? 
For Him a thousand planets - no, tens of thousands - would not be enough. The following calculation has been made. Supposing that there were a thousand thousand planets in the universe, on each 
planet three hundred thousand thousand or three hundred million people, two hundred generations in six thousand years, and the space each person was allowed was three cubic ells.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> If all these people 
were gathered together in one place the space they would fill would still be no more than a thousandth of our planet, and so would be less than the space filled by one satellite around the planet Jupiter 
or the planet Saturn. The space they filled in the universe would be small and hard to see, for those satellites are scarcely visible to the naked eye. What would this be for the Creator of the universe, 
for whom the whole universe, even if it were full up, would not be enough, since He is Infinite? I have talked to angels about these matters. They have said that they have a similar conception 
of how few the members of the human race are compared with the infinity of the Creator, though their thinking is based not on notions of objects measured spatially, but on those of states, and that 
as they conceive the matter the planets numbering tens of thousands, as many as anyone could think of, would still be as absolutely nothing in relation to the Lord. In addition they have said that the 
angelic heaven, whose seed-bed is the human race, corresponds to everything within the human being, and such a heaven cannot be built up with angels from only one planet; it must be built up with those 
from countless planets.

Quod plures mundi sint, unicuivis constare potest ex eo quod tot sidera in universo appareant, et notum et in erudito orbe quod unumquodvis sidus sit instar solis in suo loco, manet enim fixum sicut 
sol nostrae telluris in suo; et quod distantia faciat ut appareat in parva forma sicut stella; consequenter quod similiter ac sol nostri mundi circum se habet planetas, (x)qui sunt tellures; ad quid 
aliter tantum caelum cum tot astris? finis enim creationis universi est homo, ut ex homine sit caelum angelicum; quid pro Infinito Creatore foret genus humanum, et inde caelum angelicum ex una tellure, 
pro Quo non satis essent mille tellures, immo nec myriades? Calculus initus est, si forent 1,000,000 tellures in universo, et in unaquavis tellure homines numero 300,000,000 seu 300 milliones, et 200 
generationes intra 6000 annos, et cuique homini daretur spatium 3 ulnarum cubicarum, quod numerus tot hominum in unam summam collectus non usque impleret spatium millesimae partis hujus telluris, ita 
non spatium unius satellitis circum planetam Jovis vel Saturni, quod foret spatium in universo parvitatis inconspicuae, nam satelles coram nudo oculo vix apparet; quid hoc pro Creatore universi, Cui 
non satis foret si totum universum fuisset impletum, est enim Infinitus? De his cum angelis locutus sum, qui dixerunt quod illi similem ideam de paucitate generis humani respective ad infinitatem Creatoris 
habeant, sed usque quod illi non ex spatiis sed ex statibus cogitent, et quod secundum eorum ideam tellures numero tot myriadum, quot usquam cogitari possent, utque prorsus nihil forent ad Dominum. 
 Praeterea, quod caelum angelicum, cujus seminarium est (t)genus humanum, correspondeat omnibus quae apud hominem, et quod tale caelum non condi possit ab angelis ex una tellure, sed erit ex innumeris. </p>
