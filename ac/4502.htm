<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4502节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4502.</strong>“把底拿从示剑家里带出来就走了”表他们夺走了对真理的情感。这从“底拿”的代表清楚可知，“底拿”是指对真理的情感（参看<a href="4498.htm">4498</a>节）。按照内在最接近的意义，意思是这样：他们从那些作为上古教会余留的一部分的人那里夺走了对真理的情感，因为经上说他们“把底拿从示剑家里带出来”，而“示剑家”就表示这个教会的真理之良善。但由于所论述的主题是由此处雅各的儿子们所表示的雅各后代当中真理与良善的灭绝，还由于所提到的一切细节都有要被拿来应用到所论述的主题上，故“示剑家”在此简单地表示诸如存在于上古教会成员当中的那种真理之良善。因此，所表示的意思是，该良善在源于雅各的这个民族中间被灭绝了。因为就圣言的内义而言，一切名字和用语都表示它们所属主题的某个方面。同时，此处所表示的是哈抹和示剑及其家族当中的良善与真理的灭绝，因为他们接受了外在，如前所示（<a href="4493.htm">4493</a>节）。<br />关于西缅和利未目前所解释的这一切是千真万确的，这一点从雅各临死前所发的预言可以看出来：<br />西缅和利未是弟兄，他们的刀剑是强暴的器械；不要让我的灵魂进入他们的隐秘处，不要让我的荣耀参与他们的集会；因为他们在怒中杀人，任意砍断牛的腿筋。他们的怒气可咒诅，因为很猛烈；他们的暴怒可咒诅，因为很严厉；我要把他们分散在雅各中，使他们散居在以色列。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.5.htm">49:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.7.htm">7</a>）<br />“西缅和利未”表示在雅各后代当中沦为虚假的信之真理，和沦为邪恶的仁之良善，如前所示（<a href="4499.htm">4499</a>，<a href="4500.htm">4500</a>节）。他们之所以被称为“弟兄”，是因为良善是真理的弟兄，或仁是信的弟兄（<a href="4498.htm">4498</a>节）。“他们的刀剑是强暴的器械”表示向真理与良善施暴的虚假与邪恶（<a href="4499.htm">4499</a>节）。“不要让我的灵魂进入他们的隐秘处，不要让我的荣耀参与他们的集会”表示在生活和教义上的断绝，因为在圣言中，“灵魂”论及生活（<a href="1000.htm">1000</a>，<a href="1040.htm">1040</a>，<a href="1742.htm">1742</a>，<a href="3299.htm">3299</a>节），“荣耀”论及教义。“因为他们在怒中杀人，任意砍断牛的腿筋”表示他们怀着邪恶的意图灭绝了教会的真理和教会的良善，“人”（man，男人）表示教会的真理（<a href="3134.htm">3134</a>节），“牛”表示教会的良善（<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>，<a href="2566.htm">2566</a>，<a href="2781.htm">2781</a>节）。“他们的怒气可咒诅，因为很猛烈；他们的暴怒可咒诅，因为很严厉”表示因转离真理与良善所招致的惩罚：“咒诅”表示使自己转离，也表示由此招致的惩罚（<a href="245.htm">245</a>，<a href="379.htm">379</a>，<a href="1423.htm">1423</a>，<a href="3530.htm">3530</a>，<a href="3584.htm">3584</a>）；“怒气”表示背离真理，“暴怒”表示背离良善（<a href="357.htm">357</a>，<a href="3614.htm">3614</a>节）。“我要把他们分散在雅各中，使他们散居在以色列”表示良善与真理不再存在于他们教会的外在和内在中：“分散”和“散居”表示从他们当中分离并完全移除（<a href="4424.htm">4424</a>节），“雅各”是指教会的外在，“以色列”是指内在（<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>节）。<br />在这段预言中，这些话是指着西缅和利未说的，因为这两个人表示总体上教会的真理与良善；但当这些不复存在，变得无效时，尤其当虚假与邪恶取而代之时，教会就灭绝了。这就是这些预言的含义，这一点从以下事实明显看出来：西缅支派和利未支派并没有受到比其它支派更甚的咒诅。因为利未支派被选为祭司，西缅支派则作为以色列其余支派之一而存在。</p>

And took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went forth. That this signifies that they took away the affection of truth, is evident from the representation of Dinah, as being the affection of truth (see 
above, n. 4498). It is according to the proximate internal sense that they took away the affection of truth from those who were of the remains of the Most Ancient Church, because it is said that they 
"took her out of Shechem's house," "Shechem's house" signifying the good of the truth of that church. But as the subject treated of is the extirpation of truth and good among the descendants of Jacob 
who are here signified by his sons, and as all things are to be taken in application to the subject treated of, therefore by "Shechem's house" is here signified simply the good of truth such as had 
existed with the man of the Most Ancient Church; and what is signified is that this was extinguished in the nation sprung from Jacob; for in the internal sense of the Word the signification of the names 
and words is determined by the subject to which they are applied; yet here there is at the same time signified the breaking down of the good and truth with Hamor and Shechem and his family, because 
they acceded to externals, as shown above (n. 4493). [2] That what has thus far been unfolded about Simeon and Levi is really so, may be seen from the prophetic utterances of Jacob just before his death: </p>
<p> 
    Simeon and Levi are brethren, instruments of violence are their swords; let not my soul come into their secret, in their congregation let not my glory be united, for in their anger they slew 
a man, and in their pleasure they unstrung an ox; cursed be their anger, for it was vehement, and their fury, for it was grievous; I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel (Gen. 49:5-7); </p>
<p>by 
"Simeon and Levi" are signified the truth of faith which with the descendants of Jacob was turned into falsity, and the good of charity which was turned into evil (as shown above, n. 4499, 4500). 
They are called "brethren" because good is the brother of truth, or charity is the brother of faith (n. 4498). "Instruments of violence are their swords" signifies that falsities and evils inflicted 
violence on truths and goods (n. 4499). "Let not my soul come into their secret, in their congregation let not my glory be united" signifies disjunction as to life and doctrine, for in the Word "soul" 
is predicated of life (n. 1000, 1040, 1742, 3299), and "glory" of doctrine. "For in their anger they slew a man, and in their pleasure they unstrung an ox" signifies that in evil of set purpose they 
extinguished the truth of the church and the good of the church (for a "man" is the truth of the church, n. 3134, and an "ox" is its good, n. 2180, 2566, 2781). "Cursed be their anger, for it was 
vehement, and their fury, for it was grievous" signifies the penalty for turning away from truth and good (for "to curse" is to turn one's self away, and also to be punished therefor, n. 245, 379, 1423, 
3530, 3584; "anger" is a turning away from truth, and "fury," from good, n. 357, 3614). "I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel" signifies that goods and truths will no longer be in 
the external and the internal of their church ("to divide" and "to scatter" denote to separate and to extirpate from them, n. 4424; "Jacob" is the external of the church, and "Israel" the internal, 
n. 4286). [3] These things were said of Simeon and Levi in that prophecy because by them is signified the truth and good of the church in general; but when these have become null and void, and still 
more when falsities and evils succeed in their place, the church is then extinct. That such is the meaning of these prophetic words is evident from the fact that the tribe of Simeon and the tribe of Levi 
were not cursed above the other tribes; for the tribe of Levi was taken for the priesthood, and the tribe of Simeon was among the other tribes of Israel as one of them. </p>

'And they took Dinah from Shechem's house, and went away' means that they took away the affection for truth. This is clear from the representation of 'Dinah' as the affection for truth, dealt with above 
in <a href="4498.htm">4498</a>. The meaning according to the internal proximate sense is that they took away the affection for truth from those who were part of the remnants of the Most Ancient Church, for the phrase 'from 
Shechem's house' is used and by 'Shechem's house' is meant the good of truth of that Church. But as the subject here is the utter destruction of truth and good among those descended from Jacob, who 
are meant here by Jacob's sons, and as every detail mentioned has a specific application to the particular subject that is under discussion, 'Shechem's house' therefore means here simply the good of 
truth, like that which had existed with the member of the Most Ancient Church. Thus the meaning is that this good was wiped out among the nation descended from Jacob. For in the internal sense of the 
Word every expression or name means some aspect of the subject to which it belongs. At the same time the extinction of good and truth among Hamor and Shechem and his family is meant, because they accepted 
external usages, as shown in <a href="4493.htm">4493</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The truth of what has been explained so far regarding Simeon and Levi becomes clear from the prophetical utterances of Jacob before he died, where the following 
occurs, </p>
<blockquote>
Simeon and Levi are brothers; instruments of violence are their swords. Into their secret place let my soul not come; in their congregation let not my glory be united; for in their 
anger they killed a man, in their pleasure they hamstrung an ox. Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce, and their fury, for it is severe. I will divide them in Jacob, and will scatter them in Israel.

</blockquote>
<p>'Simeon and Levi' means the truth of faith which among the descendants of Jacob was turned into falsity, and the good of charity into evil, as above in <a href="4499.htm">4499</a>, <a href="4500.htm">4500</a>. They are called 'brothers' 
because good is the brother of truth, or charity is the brother of faith, <a href="4498.htm">4498</a>. 'Instruments of violence are their swords' means that falsities and evils did violence to truths and goods, <a href="4499.htm">4499</a>. 
'Into their secret place let my soul not come, in their congregation let not my glory be united' means severance as regards life and doctrine, for in the Word 'soul' is used to refer to life, <a href="1000.htm">1000</a>, <a href="1040.htm">1040</a>, <a href="1742.htm">1742</a>, <a href="3299.htm">3299</a>, and 'glory' to doctrine. 'For in their anger they killed a man, in their pleasure they hamstrung an ox' means that with evil intent they annihilated the truth of the Church and the 
good of the Church, 'a man' meaning the truth of the Church, <a href="3134.htm">3134</a>, and 'an ox' its good, <a href="2180.htm">2180</a>, <a href="2566.htm">2566</a>, <a href="2781.htm">2781</a>. 'Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce, and their fury, for it is severe' means the punishment 
incurred for turning away from truth and good - 'cursing' meaning turning oneself away and also being punished on that account, <a href="245.htm">245</a>, <a href="379.htm">379</a>, <a href="1423.htm">1423</a>, <a href="3530.htm">3530</a>, <a href="3584.htm">3584</a>, while anger means the departure from good, 
and 'fury' the departure from truth, <a href="357.htm">357</a>, <a href="3614.htm">3614</a>. 'I will divide them in Jacob, and will scatter them in Israel' means that goods and truths will exist no longer within either the external or the internal 
aspect of their Church - 'dividing' and 'scattering' meaning separating and completely removing from them, <a href="4424.htm">4424</a>, 'Jacob' being the external aspect of the Church and 'Israel' the internal, <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
These things are said about Simeon and Levi in this prophetical utterance because those two mean in general the truth and good of the Church, and when these cease to exist, and more so when falsities 
and evils take their place, the Church has been wiped out. Nothing other than this is contained in these prophetical words, as may be seen from the fact that neither the tribe of Simeon nor the 
tribe of Levi was cursed more than any other tribe. For the tribe of Levi was selected for the priesthood, and the tribe of Simeon existed as one of the rest of the tribes of Israel. </p>

`Et sumpserunt Dinam e domo Shechemi, et exiverunt': quod significet quod affectionem veri sustulerint, constat ex repraesentatione `Dinae' quod sit affectio veri, de qua supra n. 4498; secundum 
proximum sensum internum est quod sustulerint affectionem veri ab illis qui fuerunt a reliquiis Ecclesiae Antiquissimae, quia dicitur `e domo Shechemi', per domum Shechemi enim significatur bonum veri 
illius {1} Ecclesiae; sed quia agitur de exstirpatione veri et boni apud posteros ex Jacobo, qui hic per `filios ejus' significantur, et quia omnia {2} se applicate habent ad rem de qua agitur, 
ideo per `domum Shechemi' hic significatur simpliciter bonum veri, quale fuerat apud hominem Antiquissimae Ecclesiae, ita quod hoc exstinctum sit apud gentem a Jacobo; voces enim et nomina in Verbi 
sensu interno significant res praedicabiliter ad suum subjectum; insimul quoque significatur infractio boni et veri apud Hamorem et Shechemum et ejus familiam, quia ad externa accesserunt {3}, ut 
n. 4493 ostensum.  [2] Quod illa quae de Shimeone et Levi hactenus explicata sunt, ita se habeant, constare potest a propheticis Jacobi ante mortem, ubi haec,           Shimeon et Levi fratres, instrumenta 
violentiae      machaerae eorum; in arcanum eorum ne veniat anima mea, in      congregatione eorum ne uniatur gloria mea, quia in ira sua      occiderunt virum, et in complacito suo enervarunt 
bovem: </p>
<p>     maledicta ira eorum quia vehemens, et furor eorum quia      gravis est: dividam eos in Jacobum et dispergam eos in      Israelem, Gen. xlix 5-7; </p>
<p>per {4} `Shimeonem et Levi' significatur 
verum fidei quod apud posteros Jacobi versum est in falsum, et bonum charitatis in malum, ut supra n. 4499, 4500; `fratres' dicuntur quia bonum est frater veri, seu charitas fidei, n. 4498; 
`instrumenta violentiae machaerae seu gladii eorum' significat falsa et mala quod intulerint violentiam veris et bonis, n. 4499; `in arcanum eorum ne veniat anima mea, et in congregatione eorum ne 
uniatur gloria mea' significat disjunctionem quoad vitam et doctrinam, `anima' enim praedicatur in Verbo de vita, n. 1000, 1040, 1742, 3299, et `gloria' de doctrina; `quia in ira sua occiderunt virum, 
et in complacito suo enervarunt bovem' significat quod in malo proposito exstinxerint Ecclesiae verum et Ecclesiae bonum; `vir' est Ecclesiae verum, n. 3134, `bos' ejus bonum, n. 2180, 2566, 
2781; </p>
<p>`maledicta ira eorum quia vehemens, et furor eorum quia gravis' significat poenam aversionis a vero et bono {5}; `maledicere' est se avertere, et quoque propter id puniri, n.  245, 379, 1423, 
530, 384, `ira' est recessio a vero, et `furor' a bono, n. 357, 3614; </p>
<p>dividam eos in Jacobum et dispergam eos in Israelem' significat quod bona et vera non amplius erunt in Ecclesiae eorum externo 
ac interno; `dividere (c)et dispergere' est separare (o)et exstirpare ab illis, n. 4424, `Jacob' est externum Ecclesiae, ac `Israel' internum, n. 4286.  [3] (m)Haec(o) in prophetico illo de Shimeone et 
Levi dicta sunt, quia per illos significatur in genere verum et bonum Ecclesiae, quae cum nulla fiunt, et magis cum loca eorum succedunt falsa et mala, tunc Ecclesia exstincta est; quod prophetica 
haec non aliud involvant, constare potest ex eo quod tribus Shimeonis et tribus Levi non maledictae fuerint prae reliquis tribubus; fuit enim tribus Levi assumpta in sacerdotium, et tribus Shimeonis 
(o)fuit inter reliquas Israelis {6} sicut una (c)illarum.(n)      @1 alius I$      @2 i in sensu interno$      @3 recesserunt$      @4 i ibi$      @5 i et conversionis ad falsum et malum$
