<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1302.</strong>创世记11:4. 他们说，来吧，我们要建造一座城和一座塔，塔顶通天；我们要为自己立名，免得我们分散在全地面上。<br />“他们说”表这事发生了。“我们要建造一座城和一座塔”表他们编造一种教义和一种敬拜，“一座城”是指教义，“一座塔”是指自我崇拜。“塔顶通天”表甚至到了他们统治天堂事物的地步。“我们要为自己立名”表他们可以由此赢得权力的名声。“免得我们分散在全地面上”表否则他们得不到认可。</p>

And they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its head in the sky; and let us make ourselves a name, to keep from being scattered over the face of the whole earth."<br />And they said means that it happened. Let us build ourselves a city and a tower means that they made up their own doctrine and worship; a city is doctrine, and a tower is self-worship. With its head in the sky means with the eventual purpose of controlling what goes on in heaven. And let us make ourselves a name means so as to gain from this a reputation for power. To keep from being scattered over the face of the whole earth means that otherwise they would not be acknowledged. </p>

Verse 4. And they said, Come, let us build us a city and a tower, and its head in heaven; and let us make us a name, lest peradventure we be scattered upon the faces of the whole earth. "And they said," 
signifies that it came to pass; "let us build us a city and a tower," signifies that they framed a doctrine and a worship; "a city" is a doctrine, "a tower" is the worship of self; "and its head in 
heaven," signifies even to their having dominion over the things that are in heaven; "and let us make us a name," signifies that thereby they might have a reputation for power; "lest peradventure we 
be scattered upon the faces of the whole earth," signifies that otherwise they would not be acknowledged. </p>

<p>'And 
they said' means that this was done. 'Let us build ourselves a city and a tower' means that they fabricated a form of doctrine and of worship - 'a city' is doctrine, 'a tower' worship of self. 
'And its head in heaven' means to the extent of their ruling over things in heaven. 'And let us make a name for ourselves' means that as a result they might gain a reputation for power. 'Lest perhaps 
we are scattered over the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the whole earth' means that otherwise they would not receive recognition.

Vers. 4.  Et dixerunt, Age, aedificemus nobis urbem et turrim, et caput ejus in caelo; et faciamus nobis nomen, ne forte dispergamur super facies totius terrae. 'Et dixerunt' significat quod factum: 
'aedificemus nobis urbem et turrim' significat quod fingerent doctrinam et cultum; 'urbs' est doctrina; 'turris' est cultus sui: 'et caput ejus in caelo' significat usque ut dominentur super ea quae 
in caelo: 'et faciamus nobis nomen' significat ut inde fama potentiae: 'ne forte dispergamur super facies totius terrae' significat quod alioquin non agnoscerentur. </p>
