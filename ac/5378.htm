<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5378节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5378.</strong>一些灵人来到我这里，但却沉默不语。然而，过了一会儿，他们开口说话了，但不是作为许多个体说话，而是他们一起作为一个人说话。我从他们的说话方式发现他们具有这种性质：他们想知道一切，渴望解释一切，以这种方式确信某事是真的。这些灵人很谦虚，声称他们所行的不是他们自己想到的，而是受别人启发，尽管看似是他们自己想到的。就在这时，他们开始受到其他一些灵人的骚扰；我被告知，这其他灵人构成肾脏、输尿管和膀胱的区域。他们对这些灵人的反应也是很谦逊的，然而这些灵人仍不断麻烦和骚扰他们；因为这就是那些与肾脏有关的灵人的性质。他们因无法通过自己的谦逊胜过这些灵人，便采取符合其性质的行为，也就是说，使自己膨胀，由此造成恐惧。于是他们似乎放大了，不过仅仅作为一个人放大了；这个人的身量膨胀得就像似乎支撑苍天的阿特拉斯（古希腊神话中的擎天巨神）；他手里出现一支长矛；不过，除了造成恐惧外，他根本不想造成任何伤害。于是，属于肾脏的灵人从他那里逃离；这时，随着他们逃跑，只见一个灵人在追赶他们；然后又见另一个灵人从那个放大之人两脚之间的前面飞来。那个放大的人似乎还有一双木鞋，他把鞋子扔到那些属于肾脏的灵人身上。<br />天使告诉我，这些使自己变大的谦逊灵人就是与腹膜有关的灵人。腹膜是环绕并包裹所有腹部内脏的常见膜，与环绕并包裹所有胸部内脏的胸膜一样。由于这种膜如此广泛，并且较其它膜来说比较大，也能膨胀，所以属腹膜区域的灵人在受到其他灵人的骚扰时，被允许显为放大的人，同时以恐惧进行击打，尤其击打那些构成肾脏、输尿管和膀胱区域的灵人。因为这些内脏或内在器官在腹膜皱襞里面，被它固定。木鞋代表诸如由肾脏、输尿管、膀胱所吸收并输送的最低级的属世物质。因为“鞋”表示最低级的属世事物（参看<a href="259.htm">259</a>，<a href="4938.htm">4938</a>-<a href="4952.htm">4952</a>节）。这些灵人声称他们所行的都不是他们自己想到的，而是受别人启发；这种说法将他们与腹膜联系在一起，因为腹膜也具有这种性质。</p>

Some spirits came to me, but were silent. After a while, however, they spoke, yet not as many, but all as one. I noticed from their speech that they were such that they desired to know everything, and 
were eager to explain everything, and in this way to confirm themselves that a thing is so. They were modest, and said that they do nothing of themselves, but from others, although it appears to be 
from them. They were then infested by others, who were said to be those who constitute the province of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder, and whom they answered modestly; yet these continued to infest 
and assail them, for such is the nature of the kidney spirits. And as they could not prevail against them by their modesty, they resorted to what was according to their nature, namely, to enlarging themselves, 
and thereby causing terror. Thereupon they seemed to become great, but only as a one, who so swelled in stature, that like Atlas he seemed to reach to heaven; a spear appeared in his hand, 
but still he did not wish to do any harm beyond exciting terror. In consequence of this the kidney spirits fled away, and then there appeared one who pursued them in their flight, and another who flew 
in front between the feet of that great one; moreover, that great one seemed to have wooden shoes, which he threw at the kidney spirits. [2] Angels told me that those modest spirits who made themselves 
great were those who bear relation to the peritoneum. The peritoneum is the common membrane that surrounds and encloses all the viscera of the abdomen, as the pleura does all the viscera of the chest; 
and as it is so extensive, and relatively large, and also expansible, the spirits who belong to this province, when infested by others, are allowed to present themselves great in appearance, and 
at the same time to strike with terror, especially in the case of those who constitute the province of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder; for these viscera or vessels lie in the folds of the peritoneum, 
and are constrained by it. The wooden shoes represented the lowest natural things, such as the kidneys, ureters, and bladder absorb and carry off. (That shoes are the lowest natural things may be seen 
n. 259, 4938-4952.) And in saying that they do nothing of themselves, but from others, in this respect also these spirits bear relation to the peritoneum, which is also of such a nature. </p>

Some spirits once came to me but remained silent. Then after a while they did speak, though not as a number of individuals but all of them together as a single person. I recognized from the way they 
spoke that they were the kind who wished to know everything and desired the explanation for everything, and who thereby became convinced that something was true. These spirits were modest, declaring that 
nothing done by them was their own idea but was inspired by others, even though it may have seemed to be their own idea. At this point they began to be troubled by some other spirits who, I was told, 
constituted the province of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. They were modest in their response to these other spirits, who nevertheless continued to trouble and harass them; for that is what those 
connected with the kidneys are like. Consequently, since they were unable to prevail over them by their modest responses they resorted to behaviour in keeping with the disposition of the ones who 
troubled them. That is to say, they resorted to swelling themselves out and thereby striking terror. They therefore seemed to grow large, yet solely as a single person whose body swelled out just as Atlas 
seemed to tower up into the sky. A spear appeared in his hand; but for all the terror that he struck he had no desire at all to do harm. The spirits belonging to the kidneys fled from him, at which 
point a spirit was seen who pursued them as they fled, and then another was seen who set off from a forward position and flew between the feet of the enlarged one. The enlarged one also seemed to have 
wooden footwear which spread right out to those spirits belonging to the kidneys. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 Angels told me that those modest spirits who so enlarged themselves are spirits who correlate with the Peritoneum. 
The peritoneum is a general membrane which envelops and holds within it all the internal organs of the abdomen, in the way that the pleura does all the internal organs in the chest. And because 
this membrane is so extensive and is a large one compared with other membranes, and is capable of swelling out as well, the spirits connected with the peritoneum are therefore allowed, when troubled 
by others, to display themselves visually as that enlarged man and at the same time to strike terror, especially into those who constitute the province of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. For these 
interior organs or vessels lie within the folds of the peritoneum and are held in place by it. The wooden footwear represented the lowest natural substances such as are absorbed and carried away by the 
kidneys, ureters, and bladder; for by 'shoes' are meant the lowest natural things, see <a href="259.htm">259</a>, <a href="4938.htm">4938</a>-<a href="4952.htm">4952</a>. The declaration made by those spirits that nothing done by them was their own idea but was inspired 
by others also correlated them with the peritoneum, for something similar is true of the peritoneum. </p>

Spiritus quidam ad me venerunt, at erant taciti, postea tamen locuti sunt, sed non ut plures, verum omnes ut unus; appercepi ex sermone eorum quod tales essent ut omnia scire vellent, et omnia cuperent 
explicare, ac ita se confirmare {1} quod ita sit; modesti erant et dicebant quod nihil agant ex se sed ab aliis, tametsi appareat quod {2} sit (c)ex iis: infestabantur tunc ab aliis; dicebatur quod 
ab illis qui renum, ureterum, et vesicae provinciam constituunt, sed modeste illis respondebant, at usque illi hos infestabant et lacessebant, talis enim natura est renalibus; quapropter quia nihil 
per modestiam potuerunt adversus illos obtinere, ad tale quod indoli eorum conforme erat, confugiebant, nempe ad amplificandum se, et sic ad terrificandum; inde {3} visi magni fieri, sed modo sicut unus 
qui ita tumescebat corpore, ut sicut Atlas videretur attingere caelum; hasta apparebat {4} in manu at usque praeter quod terrificaret, nihil damni inferre volebat; inde renales aufugiebant; apparebat 
tunc quidam qui fugientes insecutus, et alius qui inter pedes magni istius ab anteriore pervolabat; et quoque magnus ille visus habere calceamenta lignea quae projecit versus renales.  [2] Dicebatur 
mihi ab angelis quod spiritus illi modesti qui se magnifaciebant, essent qui Peritonaeum referunt; est peritonaeum membrana communis quae circumcingit et includit viscera omnia abdominis, sicut pleura 
viscera omnia thoracis; et quia illa tam extensa est, et respective magna, et quoque tumescibilis, ideo licet illis cum ab aliis infestantur, ita magnum ad apparentiam se sistere, et simul tunc terrorem 
incutere, cumprimis erga illos qui provinciam renum, ureterum et vesicae constituunt; haec enim viscera seu vasa in duplicatura peritonaei jacent, et ab eo coercentur; per calceamenta lignea repraesentabantur 
infima naturalia qualia sunt quae renes, ureteres et vesica absorbent et deferunt; quod calcei sint infima naturalia, videatur n. 259, 4938-4952; quod dicerent se nihil ex se agere sed 
ab aliis, in hoc quoque referebant peritonaeum, quod etiam tale est. </p>
