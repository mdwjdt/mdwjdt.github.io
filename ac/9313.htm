<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9313节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9313.</strong>“我就向你的仇敌作仇敌”表主将避开邪恶所产生的一切虚假。这从“作仇敌”和“你的仇敌”的含义清楚可知：“作仇敌”当论及耶和华或主时，是指避开，如下文所述；“你的仇敌”是指邪恶所产生的虚假。这些就是灵义上的“仇敌”，因为它们不断侵扰、攻击并努力摧毁源于良善的真理；事实上，它们是对立面。“作仇敌”当论及耶和华 或主时，之所以表示避开，即避开邪恶所产生的虚假，是因为主从来不作仇敌。事实上，主是怜悯本身和良善本身；仇敌不可能进入怜悯本身和良善本身，甚至连反对虚假和邪恶的仇敌也不能进入。但虚假和邪恶会向良善和真理作仇敌；也就是说，那些陷入虚假和邪恶的人会向那些处于真理和良善的人作仇敌。正因前者在试图摧毁后者时，摧毁了自己，所以表面上看，似乎是主作了仇敌；而事实上，祂只是保护自己的安全。由此明显可知当如何理解当论及主时，“作仇敌”表示避开邪恶所产生的虚假。关于这个奥秘的详情，可参看前面的说明（<a href="4299.htm">4299</a>，<a href="7643.htm">7643</a>，<a href="7679.htm">7679</a>，<a href="7710.htm">7710</a>，<a href="7926.htm">7926</a>，<a href="7989.htm">7989</a>，<a href="8137.htm">8137</a>，<a href="8146.htm">8146</a>，<a href="8197.htm">8197</a>，<a href="8265.htm">8265</a>，<a href="8946.htm">8946</a>节）。</p>

I will act as an enemy against thine enemies. That this signifies that the Lord will avert all falsities derived from evil, is evident from the signification of "acting as an enemy," when said of Jehovah 
or the Lord, as being to avert (of which in what follows); and from the signification of "thine enemies," as being falsities derived from evil, for in the spiritual sense these are "enemies," because 
they continually infest, attack, and endeavor to destroy truths derived from good; for they are opposites. That "to act as an enemy," when said of Jehovah or the Lord, denotes to avert, namely, falsities 
derived from evil, is because the Lord never acts as an enemy; for He is mercy itself and good itself; and into mercy itself and into good itself enmity cannot enter, not even against falsity 
and evil. But falsity and evil act with enmity against good and truth; that is, those who are in falsity and evil are against those who are in truth and good; and it is because the former destroy themselves 
when they attempt to destroy the latter, that it appears as if the Lord acts as an enemy, when yet He only sets His own in safety. From this it is plain how it is to be understood that by "acting 
as an enemy," when said of the Lord, is signified to avert falsities derived from evil. (As further regards this secret, see what has been shown in n. 4299, 7643, 7679, 7710, 7926, 7989, 8137, 8146, 
8197, 8265, 8946.) </p>

'I will act as enemy to your enemies' means that the Lord will turn away all falsities arising from evil. This is clear from the meaning of 'acting as enemy', when it refers to Jehovah or the Lord, as 
turning away, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'your enemies' as falsities arising from evil. These are 'enemies' in the spiritual sense, because they constantly molest, attack, and try to 
destroy truths springing from good; for they are opposites. The reason why 'acting as enemy', when it refers to Jehovah or the Lord, means turning away - turning away falsities arising from evil - is 
that the Lord never acts as enemy. For He is Mercy itself and Goodness itself, and enmity finds no place for itself in Mercy itself and Goodness itself, not even enmity against falsity and evil. But falsity 
and evil act in enmity against goodness and truth, that is, those ruled by falsity and evil do so against those governed by truth and good. And since they destroy themselves when they try to destroy 
those governed by truth and good it seems as though the Lord acts as their enemy, when in fact He is simply keeping safe His own. This shows how to understand the explanation that 'acting as enemy', 
when it refers to the Lord, means turning away falsities arising from evil. For more about the nature of this arcanum, see what has been shown in <a href="4299.htm">4299</a>, <a href="7643.htm">7643</a>, <a href="7679.htm">7679</a>, <a href="7710.htm">7710</a>, <a href="7926.htm">7926</a>, <a href="7989.htm">7989</a>, <a href="8137.htm">8137</a>, <a href="8146.htm">8146</a>, <a href="8265.htm">8265</a>, <a href="8945.htm">8945</a>, <a href="8946.htm">8946</a>.  </p>

`Inimicum agam in inimicos tuos': quod significet quod Dominus avertet omnia falsa ex malo, constat ex significatione inimicum agere' cum de Jehovah aut {1} Domino, quod sit avertere, de qua sequitur, 
et ex significatione `inimicorum tuorum' quod sint falsa ex malo, haec enim sunt `inimici' in sensu spirituali, quia continue infestant, oppugnant, et conantur destruere vera ex bono, sunt enim opposita. 
 Quod `inimicum agere' cum de Jehovah seu Domino, sit avertere, (o)nempe falsa ex malo, est quia Dominus nusquam agit inimicum, est enim ipsa Misericordia et ipsum Bonum, (c)ac in ipsam Misericordiam 
et in ipsum Bonum non cadere potest inimicitia, ne quidem contra falsum et malum; sed falsum et malum agunt inimicitiam contra bonum et verum, hoc est, illi qui in falso et malo sunt contra illos 
qui in vero et bono; et quia illi semet destruunt cum hos destruere conantur, inde est quod appareat sicut Dominus inimicum agat, cum tamen solum in tuto ponit suos: ex his patet quomodo intelligendum 
quod per `inimicum agere' cum de Domino significetur avertere (o)falsa ex malo; quomodo cum hoc arcano (t)porro se habet, videantur quae n. 4299, 7643, 7679, 7710, 7926, 7989, (a)8137, 8146, (x)8265,
