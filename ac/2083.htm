<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2083节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2083.</strong>“你要给他起名叫以撒”表神圣理性。这从以撒的代表，及其名字的内义清楚可知。从以撒的代表可知：如前面各处所说的，亚伯拉罕代表主的内在人，而以撒代表主的理性人，雅各则代表祂的属世人。主的内在人是耶和华自己。祂的理性人因内在人流入外在人的知识情感（参看<a href="1896.htm">1896</a>，<a href="1902.htm">1902</a>，<a href="1910.htm">1910</a>节）而成孕，故源于如此与人性联结的神性。所以，“以实玛利”所代表的第一理性是人性，但它通过主变成了神性，然后由“以撒”来代表。从其名字的含义可知：以撒因“笑”而得名，而笑的内义表示对真理的情感，这情感属于理性，如前所示（<a href="2072.htm">2072</a>节），故以撒在此表神圣理性。<br />主凭自己的能力将祂所具有人性的一切事物变成神性，因此不但将理性，还将感官部分（无论内在还是外在）、因而将身体本身也变成神性。祂以这种方式将人性与神性融合。前面已说明，不仅理性，而且感官部分、因而整个身体也都变成神性和耶和华。谁都能从以下事实清楚看出这一点，即唯独祂带着身体从死中复活，以其整个神性和整个人性坐在神权的右手边。“坐在神权的右手边”表示拥有天上和地上的一切权柄。</p>

And thou shalt call his name Isaac. That this signifies the Divine rational, is evident from the representation of Isaac, and also from the signification of his "name" in the internal sense. First, from 
the representation of Isaac: Abraham, as said in various places before, represents the Lord's internal man, but Isaac His rational man, and Jacob His natural man. The Lord's internal man was Jehovah 
Himself. His rational man, because conceived from the influx of His internal man into the affection of memory-knowledges in the external man (see n. 1896, 1902, 1910), was from the Divine thus conjoined 
with the Human. Hence the first rational, represented by Ishmael, was human; but it was made Divine by the Lord, and then is represented by Isaac. Secondly, from the signification of his "name:" 
Isaac was named from "laughter;" and as in the internal sense "laughter" signifies the affection of truth, which affection belongs to the rational, as was shown above (n. 2072), "laughter" here signifies 
the Divine rational.  [2] The Lord from His own power made Divine all that was human with Him; thus not only the rational, but also the interior and the exterior sensuous part, and thereby the body 
itself. He thus united the Human to the Divine. That not only the rational, but also the sensuous part, and thus the whole body also, was made Divine and Jehovah, has been already shown, and may be 
seen by everyone from the fact that He alone rose from the dead as to the body, and sits at the right hand of the Divine power both as to all the Divine and as to all the human. To sit at the right 
hand of the Divine power, signifies to have all sovereign power in heaven and in earth. </p>

'And you will call his name Isaac' means the Divine Rational. This is clear from Isaac's representation and also from the meaning of his name in the internal sense. </p>
<p>From Isaac's representation: As 
stated frequently already, 'Abraham' represents the Lord's Internal Man, 'Isaac' His Rational Man, and 'Jacob' His Natural Man. The Lord's Internal Man was Jehovah Himself. Because the Rational Man was 
conceived from the influx of the Internal Man into the External Man's affection for knowledge, <a href="1896.htm">1896</a>, <a href="1902.htm">1902</a>, <a href="1910.htm">1910</a>, it originated in the Divine thus joined to the Human. Consequently the first rational 
represented by 'Ishmael' was human, but it was made Divine by the Lord, and is then represented by 'Isaac'. </p>
<p>From the meaning of his name: He was given the name Isaac from the word for 'laughter', 
and because laughter in the internal sense means the affection for truth, which belongs to the rational, as shown above in <a href="2072.htm">2072</a>, Isaac accordingly here means the Divine Rational. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 From His own 
power the Lord made Divine everything that was human with Him. Thus He made not only the rational Divine but also the sensory part, interior and exterior, and so the body itself. In this way He united 
the Human to the Divine. It has been shown already that not only the rational, but also the sensory part, and so the whole body also was made Divine and Jehovah. This may also become clear to anyone 
from the fact that He alone has risen as to the body from the dead, and sits at the right hand of the Divine Power both with His entire Divine and with His entire Human. 'Sitting at the right hand of 
Divine power' means having all power in heaven and on earth. </p>

`Et vocabis nomen illius Jishak': quod significet Rationale Divinum, constat ex repraesentatione `Isaci,' tum a significatione nominis ejus in sensu interno.  Ex repraesentatione Isaci: `Abraham,' ut 
prius passim dictum, repraesentat Internum Hominem Domini; `Isacus' autem Rationalem, et `Jacobus' Naturalem; Internus Homo Domini fuit Ipse Jehovah; Rationalis quia conceptus ab influxu Interni Hominis 
in affectionem scientiarum Externi, n. 1896, 1902, 1910, fuit ex Divino ita conjuncto Humano, inde rationale primum per `Ismaelem' repraesentatum {1} fuit humanum, sed a Domino factum Divinum, ac 
ita repraesentatur per `Isacum.'  A significatione nominis: Isacus nominatus est a `risu,' et quia risus in sensu interno significat affectionem veri quae est rationalis, ut ostensum est supra n. 2072, 
ita hic Rationale Divinum.  [2] Dominus ex propria potentia omne quod humanum apud Ipsum fuit, Divinum fecit; ita non solum rationale, sed etiam sensuale interius et exterius, ita ipsum corpus; sic 
univit Humanum Divino: quod non solum rationale {2}, sed etiam sensuale, ita totum corpus, etiam factum Divinum et Jehovah, prius ostensum; et constare potest unicuique ex eo quod solus quoad corpus 
resurrexerit ex mortuis, et ad dextram potentiae Divinae, tam quoad omne Divinum quam quoad omne Humanum, sedeat; `ad dextram potentiae Divinae sedere' significat omnem potestatem habere in caelis et 
in terris. 	@1 significatum.$ 	@2 i Ipsius.$ </p>
