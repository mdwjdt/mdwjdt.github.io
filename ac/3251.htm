<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3251节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3251.</strong>“这些是亚伯拉罕一生活着的年日”表通过亚伯拉罕来表现的主神性本身的状态代表。 这从“年日”和此处“一生”的含义清楚可知：“年日”是指状态（<a href="23.htm">23</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="488.htm">488</a>，<a href="493.htm">493</a>，<a href="893.htm">893</a>，<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>节）；“一生”也是指状态（<a href="2904.htm">2904</a>节），在此是指由亚伯拉罕来代表的状态。事实上，如圣言中所描述的，亚伯拉罕的整个一生都是代表，现在论述的是这一生的结束。亚伯拉罕代表主的神性本身，这在所给出的解读中已经说明。为了能代表祂，他取名叫亚伯拉罕，加进来的字母“H”就取自耶和华（Jehovah）这个名（<a href="2010.htm">2010</a>节）。亚伯拉罕既代表被称为“父”的神性本身，也代表被称为“子”的神性人，因而代表主的神性本身和神性人。不过，这神性人自永恒就存在，主通过这神性人显现，并且当荣耀了生在时间中的人身后，祂使这人身服从神性人。这就是通过亚伯拉罕来表现的主的代表。</p>

And these are the days of the years of the lives of Abraham, which he lived. That this signifies a state representative by Abraham of the Lord as to the Divine Itself, is evident from the signification 
of "days" and "years," as being states (n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788); and from the signification here of "lives," as also being states (n. 2904), here, states that were represented by Abraham; 
for all his life, as it is described in the Word, and the end of which is now treated of, was representative. That Abraham represented the Lord as to the Divine Itself, has been shown in the explications. 
In order that he might represent, he was called by the name Abraham, the letter "h" being inserted, which was taken from the name "Jehovah" (n. 2010). Abraham represented both the Divine Itself, 
which is called the "Father," and the Divine Human, which is called the "Son," thus he represented the Lord as to both the Divine Itself and the Divine Human, but that Divine Human which is from eternity, 
from which came forth and to which He reduced or brought the Human that was born in time, when He glorified it. This is the representation of the Lord by Abraham. </p>

'These are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he rived' means the state representative of the Lord as regards the Divine itself that was portrayed by means of Abraham. This is clear from the 
meaning of 'days' and of 'years' as states, dealt with in <a href="23.htm">23</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="488.htm">488</a>, <a href="493.htm">493</a>, <a href="893.htm">893</a>, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, and from the meaning here of 'life' also as state, dealt with in <a href="2904.htm">2904</a>, here as the representative states portrayed 
by means of Abraham. Indeed his whole life as described in the Word was representative, the end of which life is the subject now. The consideration that Abraham represented the Lord as regards the 
Divine itself has been shown in the explanations that have been given, and so as to represent Him he was named Abraham - the letter H, taken from the name Jehovah, having been inserted, <a href="2010.htm">2010</a>. Abraham 
represented both the Divine itself, which is called the Father, and the Divine Human, which is referred to as the Son. He accordingly represented the Lord as regards both, though the Divine Human represented 
by Him was the Divine Human existing from eternity, of which the Lord was the manifestation and to which He subordinated the Human born in time when He glorified it. This is the representation 
of the Lord portrayed by means of Abraham. </p>

`Hi dies annorum vitarum Abrahami, quos vixit': quod significet statum repraesentativum Domini quoad Ipsum Divinum, per Abrahamum, constat ex significatione `dierum et annorum' quod sint status, de 
qua n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788, et ex significatione `vitarum' hic quod etiam sint status, de qua n. 2904, hic status repraesentativi qui per Abrahamum; omnis enim vita ejus qualis in Verbo descripta 
est, fuit repraesentativa, de cujus fine nunc agitur. Quod `Abraham' repraesentaverit Dominum quoad Ipsum Divinum, in explicationibus ostensum est; {1}ob finem ut repraesentaret, vocatus est nomine 
Abraham, interjecta littera H, quae ex nomine Jehovae desumpta est, n. (x)2010; repraesentavit Abraham et Ipsum Divinum quod Pater vocatur, et Divinum Humanum quod Filius dicitur, ita Dominum quoad 
utrumque, at Divinum Humanum quod ab aeterno, a quo exstitit, et ad quod Humanum in tempore natum redegit cum illud glorificavit: haec repraesentatio Domini est per Abrahamum. @1 i et$  </p>
