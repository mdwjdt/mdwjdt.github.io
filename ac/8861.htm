<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8861节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8861.</strong>“神吩咐这一切的话说”表为天上和地上之人的神之真理。这从“耶和华吩咐的话”的含义清楚可知，“耶和华吩咐的话”是指神之真理，因为神所说的话无非是真理。也正因如此，神之真理被称为“圣言”，“圣言”就是主，正如约翰福音中（1:1）所说的，因为当主在世时，祂就是神性真理本身，后来等到祂得了荣耀，就变成神性良善；从这时起，一切神性真理皆从祂发出。这神性真理作为光来到天使面前，这光还光照我们的内在视觉，也就是理解力。<br />这种内在视觉因看不到属世事物，而是看到属灵事物，故以真理为它的对象。在属灵的理解层面，它以被称为信之真理的属灵真理为它的对象。但在属世的理解层面，它以涉及一个人作为公民的角色的真理，也就是与公正有关的真理，以及涉及一个人在私人生活中的角色的真理，也就是与品行或信誉有关的真理，最后以属世真理，也就是由外在感官，尤其视觉所感知到的对象所形成的结论为它的对象。由此可见真理遵循哪种次序，所有真理，无论集合在一起的，还是单个的，都来源于神之真理，神之真理是万物的内在初始。此外，它们所在的形式也来源于同一源头，因为这些形式被造来接受并包含它们。这一切表明当如何理解约翰福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.3.htm">3</a>）中的这一教导：万物是藉着圣言造的；因为神之真理是至高无上的本质实体，是独一的真正实质，万物都皆通过这实体、实质而产生。</p>

And God spake all these words, saying. That this signifies truths Divine for those in the heavens and for those on earth, is evident from the signification of "the words which God spake," as being truths 
Divine, for the things which God speaks are nothing else than truths. From this also truth Divine is called "the Word," and "the Word" is the Lord, according to John 1:1, for the reason that when 
the Lord was in the world He was the Divine truth itself, and afterward when He was glorified He became the Divine good, and thenceforth all Divine truth proceeds from Him. This Divine truth is light 
to the angels, which light is also that which illuminates our internal sight, which is that of the understanding. [2] As this sight does not see natural, but spiritual things, it has for its objects 
in the spiritual understanding the truths which are called the truths of faith; but in the natural understanding it has for its objects truths of the civil state which relate to what is just, and also 
truths of the moral state which relate to what is reputable, and lastly natural truths which are conclusions from the objects of the external senses, especially of the sight. From all this it can be 
seen in what order truths follow, and that all and each have their origin from truths Divine, which are the internal beginnings of all things. Moreover the forms in which they are have had their origin 
from the same source, for these were created to receive and contain. This shows what is meant in John by all things having been created through the Word (John 1:1-3); for truth Divine is the veriest 
essential, and is the only substantial through which all things are. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8861</b></p><p><b>8861.</b>
'And God spoke all these words, saying' means God's truths for those in heaven and for those on earth. This is clear from the meaning of 'the words which God spoke' as God's truths; for things that God 
speaks are nothing other than truths. So it is also that God's truth is called 'the Word' - 'the Word' being the Lord - in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:1</a>, for the reason that the Lord was Divine Truth itself while He was 
in the world. And after that, when He was glorified, He became Divine Good, and ever since then He has been the source from whom all Divine Truth flows. This Divine Truth comes to the angels as light, 
the light which also enlightens our inward sight, or power of understanding. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Since this kind of sight does not see natural but spiritual things it has truths as its objects. On the level of 
the understanding it has spiritual ones, called the truths of faith. But on the natural level it has as its objects the truths concerning a person's role as a citizen, which are truths about what is right; 
also the truths concerning a person's role in private life, which are truths about what is honourable; and lastly the natural truths that are conclusions formed on the basis of objects perceived 
by the outward senses, in particular that of sight. From all this one may see in what order truths follow one another, and that all collectively and individually have their origin in God's truths, which 
are the inner beginnings of all truths The forms also in which they exist have the same origin, since such forms have been created to receive and contain them. This shows how the teaching in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:1-3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:1-3</a>, that all things were created through the Word, should be understood; for God's truth is the supreme essential entity, the one true substance, through which all things come into being. </p>

</p><b>8861.</b>
`Et locutus est Deus omnia verba haec, dicendo': quod significet vera Divina illis in caelis et illis in terris, constat ex significatione `verborum quae Deus locutus' quod sint vera Divina, nam quae 
Deus loquitur non sunt nisi quam vera; inde etiam verum Divinum vocatur Verbum, et Verbum est Dominus apud Johannem i 1, ex causa quia Dominus fuit ipsum Divinum Verum cum in mundo erat, et postea cum 
glorificatus est, factus est Divinum Bonum, ac tunc ex Ipso omne Divinum Verum procedit; hoc Divinum Verum {1} est angelis lux, quae lux etiam est quae illuminat visum nostrum internum, qui est intellectus; 
 [2] hic visus quia non naturalia sed spiritualia videt, pro objectis habet vera, in intellectu {2}spiritualia, quae vocantur fidei, sed in naturali pro objectis habet vera status civilis quae 
sunt justi, et quoque vera status moralis quae sunt honesti, et ultimo vera naturalia quae sunt conclusiones ex objectis sensuum externorum, imprimis visus.  Ex his videri potest quo ordine consequuntur 
vera, et quod omnia et singula originem ducant ex veris Divinis, quae sunt interna principia omnium; etiam formae illorum in quibus sunt, inde originem duxerunt, nam illae creatae sunt ad recipiendum 
et {3} continendum; inde constare potest quid intelligitur per quod omnia creata sint per Verbum apud Johannem i 1-3; nam verum Divinum est ipsissimum essentiale, {4}et est unicum substantiale, 
per quod omnia. @1 i in coelo$  @2 vera spiritualia, quae sunt vitae aeternae, et$  @3 i ad$  @4 immo unicum essentiale, ex quo omnia$  </p>
