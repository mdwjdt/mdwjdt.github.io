<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3373节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3373.</strong>“和你的种”表真理。这从“种”的含义清楚可知，“种”是指真理（参看<a href="29.htm">29</a>，<a href="255.htm">255</a>，<a href="1025.htm">1025</a>，<a href="1447.htm">1447</a>，<a href="1610.htm">1610</a>，<a href="1940.htm">1940</a>，<a href="2848.htm">2848</a>，<a href="3310.htm">3310</a>节），因而它表示来自主神性的真理，也就是“你的种”。那些仅仅照字义理解圣言的人只知道“种”表示后代，因而在此表示以撒经由以扫和雅各，主要经由雅各而来的后代。因为圣言就存在于这个民族中，并包含有关他们的许多历史事实。但就内义而言，“种”不是指源于以撒的任何后代，而是指为主的“儿子”、因而为其“天国之子”的所有人，或也可说，是指那些处于来自主的良善与真理之人。由于这些人才是“种”，故可知，来自主的良善与真理就是“种”，因为使人成为祂“儿子”的，就是主的良善与真理。这也是为何出自主的真理本身在马太福音中被称为“天国之子”的原因：<br />那撒好种的就是人子；田地就是世界；好种就是天国之子。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.37.htm">13:37</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.38.htm">38</a>）<br />因此，“儿子”通常也表示真理（<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>，<a href="2623.htm">2623</a>节）。<br />人若稍微深思，或往深处想一想，就能知道在神圣的圣言中，亚伯拉罕、以撒和雅各的种被如此频繁提及，并且经上多次声称他们要被赐福，并且所赐的福超过全世界所有民族和人民，他们不可能是指这三人的后代。因为在所有民族当中，他们最不会被对主之爱和对邻之仁的良善所打动，甚至没有任何信之真理。因为他们完全不知道主是谁，祂的国度是什么，因而天堂和死后的生活是什么。他们之所以不知道这些事，既因为他们不想知道，还因为他们若获知这些事，会发自内心否认它们，从而亵渎内层良善与真理，就像他们因公然变成偶像崇拜者而多次亵渎外层良善与真理一样。这就是为何内层真理在旧约的字义中极少看到的原因。由于这些人具有这样的性质，故主引用以赛亚书论到他们说：<br />主叫他们瞎了眼、硬了心，免得他们眼睛看见，心里明白，回转过来，我就医治他们。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.40.htm">12:40</a>）<br />当他们声称他们是“亚伯拉罕的种”时，主又说：<br />我们是亚伯拉罕的种；亚伯拉罕是我们的父；耶稣对他们说，你们若是亚伯拉罕的儿子，就必行亚伯拉罕所行的事；你们是出于你们的父魔鬼，你们父的私欲，你们偏要行。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.33.htm">8:33</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.39.htm">39</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.44.htm">44</a>）<br />“亚伯拉罕”在此和在圣言的各处一样，用来表示主。主明确说明，犹太人不是他的种，或儿子，而是魔鬼的种。所有这一切清楚表明，在圣言的历史部分和预言部分所提到的“亚伯拉罕、以撒和雅各的种”，绝不是指他们的后代，因为圣言的每一个细节都是神性，故“亚伯拉罕、以撒和雅各的种”表示所有那些为“主之种”的人，也就是所有那些处于对祂之信的良善与真理之人。天堂之种，也就是一切良善与真理，唯独出自主（参看<a href="1438.htm">1438</a>，<a href="1614.htm">1614</a>，<a href="2016.htm">2016</a>，<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>，<a href="2882.htm">2882</a>-<a href="2883.htm">2883</a>，<a href="2891.htm">2891</a>-<a href="2892.htm">2892</a>，<a href="2904.htm">2904</a>，<a href="3195.htm">3195</a>节）。</p>

And unto thy seed. That this signifies truth, is evident from the signification of "seed," as being truth (see n. 29, 255, 1025, 1447, 1610, 1940, 2848, 3310); thus it signifies the truth which is from 
the Lord's Divine, which is "thy seed." They who apprehend the Word only according to the sense of the letter cannot know but that "seed" denotes posterity, consequently here the posterity of Isaac 
from Esau and Jacob, and chiefly from Jacob, because the Word was in that nation and it contains so many historical facts concerning them. But in the internal sense by "seed" there is not meant any posterity 
from Isaac, but all those who are sons of the Lord, thus the sons of His kingdom, or what is the same, who are in good and truth from the Lord; and because these are "seed," it follows that the 
very good and truth from the Lord are "seed," for hence come the sons; wherefore also the very truths from the Lord are called the "sons of the kingdom," in Matthew: </p>
<p>     He that soweth the good seed 
is the Son of man; the field is the world; the good seed are the sons of the kingdom (Matt. 13:37-38); </p>
<p>hence also by "sons" in general are signified truths (n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623). [2] Everyone 
who thinks somewhat more deeply or interiorly may know that in the Divine Word by the "seed of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob," so often mentioned, and concerning which it is so frequently said 
that it should be blessed, and this above all nations and people in the world, cannot be signified their posterity; for above all nations they were least of all in the good of love to the Lord and of 
charity toward the neighbor, and were not even in any truth of faith; for they were utterly ignorant of what the Lord is, what His kingdom, thus what heaven is, and what the life after death, both because 
they did not want to know, and because if they had learned about these things, they would at heart have totally denied them, and would thus have profaned interior goods and truths, just as they 
so frequently profaned exterior ones by becoming open idolaters; which is the reason why in the sense of the letter of the Word of the Old Testament any interior things so rarely stand forth to view. 
Being of this nature, the Lord has said concerning them, quoting Isaiah: </p>
<p>     He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, lest they should see with their eyes and understand with their heart, 
and should be converted, and I should heal them (John 12:40); </p>
<p>and again when they said: </p>
<p>     We are Abraham's seed; Abraham is our father; Jesus said unto them, If ye were Abraham's sons, ye would 
do the works of Abraham; ye are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father ye will to do (John 8:33, 39, 44); </p>
<p>by "Abraham" here is meant the Lord, as everywhere in the Word; and that 
the Jews were not his seed, or sons, but the seed of the devil, is plainly stated. All this shows very plainly that by the "seed of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob" as mentioned in the historical and 
prophetical Word, are by no means meant their posterity-for the Word throughout is Divine-but all those who are the Lord's "seed," that is, who are in the good and truth of faith in Him. (That from the 
Lord alone comes heavenly seed, that is, all good and truth, may be seen above n. 1438, 1614, 2016, 2803, 2882-2883, 2891-2892, 2904, 3195.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3373</b></p><p><b>3373.</b>
'And to your seed' means truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'seed' as truth, dealt with in <a href="29.htm">29</a>, <a href="255.htm">255</a>, <a href="1025.htm">1025</a>, <a href="1447.htm">1447</a>, <a href="1610.htm">1610</a>, <a href="1940.htm">1940</a>, <a href="2848.htm">2848</a>, <a href="3310.htm">3310</a>, and so truth from the Lord's Divine, which is 'your seed'. 
Those who understand the Word solely according to the sense of the letter can know no more than this, that 'seed' means descendants - here Isaac's descendants through Esau and Jacob, primarily through 
Jacob since the Word existed among that nation and so many of its historical descriptions have to do with them. But in the internal sense 'seed' is not used to mean any descendants from Isaac but all 
who are the Lord's 'sons', and so who are 'the sons of His kingdom', or what amounts to the same, those in whom good and truth which come from the Lord are present And as these constitute 'the seed' 
it follows that good and truth themselves from the Lord are 'the seed', for these are what make people His 'sons'. This is also the reason why truths themselves which come from the Lord are called 'the 
sons of the kingdom' in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man, the field is the world, the seed are the sons of the kingdom. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:37,%2038&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13:37, 38</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And for this reason also 'sons' generally 
means truths, <a href="489.htm">489</a>, <a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="533.htm">533</a>, <a href="1147.htm">1147</a>, <a href="2623.htm">2623</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Anyone who thinks rather more deeply or inwardly may recognize that the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, mentioned so many times, and spoken of 
so many times as those who were to be blessed, and more so than all nations and peoples in all the world, cannot in the Divine Word mean the descendants of those three. For among all nations they least 
of all were moved by the good that flows from love to the Lord and from charity towards the neighbour. Nor indeed did any truth of faith exist with them. Who the Lord is, what His kingdom is, and 
so what heaven is and what the life after death, they did not know at all. They did not know these things because for one thing they did not wish to know and for another because if they had come to know 
about them they would have denied them completely in their hearts and so would have profaned interior goods and truths, as they did exterior by becoming on so many occasions open idolaters. This is 
the reason why any interior truths are rarely visible in the literal sense of the Old Testament Word. Because the nature of those people was such, the Lord therefore said about them, quoting Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
He 
has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, lest they see with their eyes and understand with their heart, and are converted and I heal them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2012:40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 12:40</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>What He said about them when they 
declared they were 'the seed of Abraham', </p>
<blockquote>
They said, We are the seed of Abraham. Our father is Abraham. Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham's sons, you would do the works of Abraham. You are 
from your father the devil, and the desires of your father you will to do. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%208:33,%2039,%2044&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 8:33, 39, 44</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'Abraham' is used to mean the Lord, as in every other instance in the Word. The Lord explicitly 
states that they were not His seed or sons but came from the devil. From this it is quite evident that 'the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob' in both the historical part and the prophetical part of 
the Word is in no way used to mean such descendants, for the Word is Divine in every detail Instead it means all who constitute 'the Lord's seed', that is, those with whom the good and truth of faith 
in Him are present. The fact that heavenly seed, that is, all good and truth, comes from the Lord alone, see <a href="1438.htm">1438</a>, <a href="1614.htm">1614</a>, <a href="2016.htm">2016</a>, <a href="2803.htm">2803</a>, <a href="2882.htm">2882</a>, <a href="2883.htm">2883</a>, <a href="2891.htm">2891</a>, <a href="2892.htm">2892</a>, <a href="2904.htm">2904</a>, <a href="3195.htm">3195</a>. </p>

`Et semini tuo':  quod significet verum, constat ex significatione `seminis' quod sit verum, de qua n. 29, 255, 1025, 1447, 1610, (x)1940, 1848, 3310; ita verum quod a Divino Domini, quod est `semen 
tuum.' Qui Verbum modo secundum sensum litterae capiunt, non aliter scire possunt quam quod `semen' sit posteritas, proinde hic posteritas Jishaki ex Esavo et Jacobo, principaliter ex Jacobo, quia in 
illa gente fuit Verbum, et historica de illis tot ibi existant; sed in sensu interno per `semen' non aliqua posteritas ex Jishako intelligitur, sed omnes illi qui filii sunt Domini, ita filii regni Ipsius, 
seu quod idem, qui in bono et vero sunt quae a Domino; et quia illi sunt `semen,' sequitur quod ipsum bonum et verum a Domino sit `semen,' nam inde sunt filii, quapropter etiam ipsa vera quae a 
Domino vocantur `filii regni,' apud Matthaeum,           Qui seminat bonum semen est Filius hominis; ager est      mundus, semen sunt filii regni, xiii 37, 38; </p>
<p>inde quoque in genere per `filios' significantur 
vera, n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623: [2] quisque, {1}qui aliquantum altius seu interius cogitat, scire potest {2}quod per semen Abrahami, Jishaki et Jacobi quod toties nominatur, et de quo 
toties dicitur quod benediceretur, et hoc prae omnibus gentibus et populis in orbe terrarum, in Divino Verbo non significari possit posteritas eorum, hi enim inter omnes gentes omnium minime in {3}bono 
amoris in Dominum et {4}charitatis erga proximum fuerunt, immo nec in aliquo vero fidei; nam quid Dominus, quid Ipsius regnum, ita quid caelum, et quid vita post mortem, prorsus nesciebant, tam quia 
non scire volebant, quam quia si resciverint de illis, corde suo prorsus negavissent, ac ita bona et vera interiora profanavissent, sicut exteriora per id quod toties aperti idololatrae facti sint, 
quae causa est quod tam raro aliqua interiora in Verbi Veteris Testamenti sensu litterae exstent; {5}quia tales erant, ideo Dominus de illis ex Esaia, dixit,           Excaecavit illorum oculos, et obturavit 
illorum cor, ut      non videant oculis suis, et intelligant corde, et convertant      se, et sanem eos, Joh. xii 40; </p>
<p>et de illis, cum se dixerunt semen Abrahami esse,           Dixerunt, 
Semen Abrahami sumus; pater noster Abrahamus      est; dicit illis Jesus, Si filii Abrahami essetis, opera      Abrahami faceretis; vos ex patre diabolo estis, et desideria      patris vestri vultis 
facere, Joh. viii 33, 39, 44; </p>
