<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8530节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8530.</strong>“你拿一个罐子”表真理。这从“一个罐子”的含义清楚可知，“一个罐子”在此是指真理。“一个罐子”之所以表示真理，是因为它是盛吗哪的器皿，而吗哪表示良善；一切真理都是良善的一个器皿。也正因如此，“器皿”一般表示真理（<a href="3068.htm">3068</a>，<a href="3079.htm">3079</a>，<a href="3316.htm">3316</a>，<a href="3318.htm">3318</a>节），因此，具体的“器皿”，以及此处的“一个罐子”也是。真理是盛纳良善的器皿，这一点可通过自然界的各种食物来说明。例如光，光是盛纳太阳之热的一个容器，光表示真理，光里面的热表示良善；真理与良善的关系也是这样。它们的关系也就像衣服与身体、身体与灵魂的关系，还像一根血管或纤维与包在它里面的血液或动物灵的关系。另外，它们的关系就像肺与心，因而肺呼吸与心跳的关系。简言之，这种关系就像身体的各种器官形式与该形式里面的生命的关系。这些比较清楚说明了没有良善的真理是什么样，或说无仁之信是什么样，即：它就像没有任何生命的身体器官形式；没有心跳的肺呼吸，或像没有心的肺；像没有血液或动物灵的一根血管或纤维，以及没有灵魂的身体。所以，没有良善的真理就像某种无生命的物体；如果它里面是邪恶，而不是良善，那么它就像一具尸体。</p>

Take an urn. That this signifies truth, is evident from the signification of "an urn," as here being truth. That "an urn" denotes truth, is because it was the vessel which received the manna, by which 
is signified good, and all truth is as a vessel for good; hence also by "vessels" in general are signified truths (n. 3068, 3079, 3316, 3318), and consequently by "vessels" in particular, and here by 
"an urn." That truths are recipient vessels for good may be illustrated by various things in nature-as by light, which is recipient of the heat from the sun, the light signifying truth, and the heat 
in the light signifying good. So it is with truth and good. It is similar with a garment in respect to the body, and with the body in respect to the soul; also with a blood-vessel and a fiber in respect 
to the blood and animal spirit enclosed therein; so also with the lungs in respect to the heart, consequently with the respiration of the lungs in respect to the pulse of the heart; in a word, with 
every organic form of the body in respect to the life which is therein. From these comparisons it can be seen what is the quality of truth without good, or what is the quality of faith without charity, 
namely, that it is like the organic forms of the body without life; that it is like the respiration of the lungs without the pulse of the heart, or like the lungs without the heart; and that it is 
like a blood-vessel and a fiber without blood and animal spirit; also like a body without a soul; consequently that it is like something inanimate; and if evil instead of good be therein it is like a carcass. </p>

'Take a jar' means truth. This is clear from the meaning here of 'a jar' as truth. The reason why 'a jar' means truth is that it was a vessel to contain 'the manna', by which good is meant; and all truth 
is like a vessel for good. So it is also that truths are meant by 'vessels' generally, <a href="3068.htm">3068</a>, <a href="3079.htm">3079</a>, <a href="3316.htm">3316</a>, <a href="3318.htm">3318</a>, consequently by 'vessels' in particular, and here by 'a jar'. Various things in the 
natural order may serve to elucidate the idea that truths are vessels for containing good. Light for example is a container of heat from the sun, and also by light is meant truth and by the heat within 
light is meant good; the relationship of truth to good is like these. Their relationship is also like that of clothing to the body, and of the body to the soul, as well as being like that of a blood 
vessel or of a fibre to the blood or to the animal spirit<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> enclosed within it. In addition it is like that of the lungs to the heart, and therefore of the breathing of the lungs to the beating of the 
heart. In short, the relationship is like that of any organic form which the body possesses to the life within that form. These comparisons make clear what truth without good is like, or what faith without 
charity is like. They show that it is like organic forms belonging to the body without any life; like the breathing of the lungs without the beating of the heart, or like the lungs without the 
heart; like a blood vessel or a fibre without blood or animal spirit; and also like the body without the soul. Consequently truth without good is like an inanimate object; or if evil is present instead 
of good it is like a corpse.

`Accipe urnam unam': quod significet verum, constat ex significatione `urnae' quod hic sit verum; quod `urna' sit verum, est quia erat vas recipiens `mannae,' per quam significatur bonum, et omne verum 
est sicut vas boni; inde quoque per `vasa' in genere significantur vera, n. 3068, 3079, 3316, 3318, consequenter per `vasa' in specie, et hic per `urnam.'  Quod vera sint vasa recipientia boni, illustrari 
potest a variis in natura, ut a luce quae est recipiens caloris e sole; per lucem etiam significatur verum, et per calorem in luce significatur bonum: similiter se habet verum (x)ad bonum: se 
{1}quoque habet sicut vestis ad corpus et sicut corpus ad animam: se (t)quoque habet sicut vas sanguineum et fibra ad inclusum sanguinem et animalem spiritum: se habet porro sicut pulmo ad cor, proinde 
sicut respiratio {2}quae pulmonis ad pulsum qui cordis: verbo, se habet sicut omnis forma organica corporis ad vitam inibi; ex comparativis his constare potest quale est verum absque bono, seu qualis 
est fides absque charitate, quod nempe sit sicut formae organicae corporis absque vita: {3} quod sit sicut respiratio pulmonum absque pulsu cordis, seu sicut pulmo absque corde: sitque sicut vas sanguineum
