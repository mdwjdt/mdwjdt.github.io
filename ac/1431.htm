<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1431节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1431.</strong>创世记12:5. 亚伯兰带上他妻子撒莱和他兄弟的儿子罗得，连他们在哈兰所积蓄的财物，所得的灵魂，都出来往迦南地去。他们就到了迦南地。<br />“亚伯兰带上他妻子撒莱”表与真理结合的良善，“亚伯兰” 如前面所说，表示主，这时的主还是个小孩子；“他妻子撒莱”表真理。“他兄弟的儿子罗得”表通过感官学到的真理，因而表童年时被植入的最初之物。“连他们所积蓄的财物”表通过感官学到的一切真理。“他们在哈兰所得的灵魂”表可能存在于那个朦胧状态中的一切生命本质。“都出来往迦南地去”表祂以这种方式逐渐接近爱的属天事物。“他们就到了迦南地”表祂获得了爱的属天事物。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1431.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1431/bible_king-james-version_genesis_12_5" target=_top>Genesis 12:5</a>. And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their gain that they had gained, and [every] soul that they had made in Haran, and they left to go into the land of Canaan. And they came into the land of Canaan.<br />And Abram took Sarai his wife symbolizes goodness with truth connected to it. Abram, as noted [搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1431/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1402" target=_top>1402</a>], means the Lord, and here it means when he was young; Sarai his wife means truth. And Lot his brother's son symbolizes truth gained through the senses, that is, the first kind of truth instilled in the youth. And all the gain that they had gained symbolizes everything that can be identified as sensory truth. And [every] soul that they had made in Haran symbolizes all the essential vitality that is possible in this shadowy state. And they left to go into the land of Canaan means that by these means he would press on all the way to the heavenly aspects of love. And they came into the land of Canaan means that he arrived at the heavenly aspects of love. </p>

Verse 5. And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gotten, and the soul that they had gained in Haran: and they went forth to go into the land of 
Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came. "And Abram took Sarai his wife," signifies good to which truth has been adjoined; by "Abram," as has been said, is meant the Lord; here, when He was a child; 
by Sarai" as a "wife," is meant truth: "and Lot his brother's son," signifies sensuous truth, thus the first that is insinuated into a child; "and all their substance that they had gotten," signifies 
all things that are sensuous truths; "and the soul that they had gained in Haran," signifies every living essential that was possible in that obscure state; "and they went forth to go into the land 
of Canaan," signifies that He thus advanced to the celestial things of love; "and into the land of Canaan they came," signifies that He attained to the celestial things of love. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1431</b></p><p><b>1431.</b>
Verse 5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their acquisitions that they had acquired, and [every] soul which they had gained in Haran. And they came out to go into the 
land of Canaan; and they came into the land of Canaan. </p>
<p>'And Abram took Sarai his wife' means good to which truth has been joined, 'Abram', as stated, being used to mean the Lord - here when He was 
a boy - and 'Sarai his wife' to mean truth 'And Lot his brother's son' means truth that has been learned through the senses, thus the first that is implanted in childhood 'And all the acquisitions that 
they had acquired' means all truths that have been learned through the senses. 'And [every] soul which they had gained in Haran' means every essential with life in it that was possible in that obscure 
state. 'And they came out to go into the land of Canaan' means that in this manner He drew closer to the celestial things of love 'And they came into the land of Canaan' means that He attained to the 
celestial things of love. </p>

</p><b>1431.</b>
Vers. 5.  Et accepit Abram Sarai uxorem suam, et Lotum filium fratris sui, et omnem acquisitionem illorum, quam acquisiverunt, et animam quam fecerant in Haran; et exiverunt ad eundum in terram Canaan, 
et venerunt in terram Canaan. 'Et accepit Abram Sarai uxorem suam' significat bonum cui adjunctum est verum; per 'Abram,' ut dictum, intelligitur Dominus, (x)hic cum puer fuit; per 'Sarai uxorem' 
verum:  'et Lotum filium fratris sui' significat verum sensuale, ita primum quod insinuatur puero:  'et omnem acquisitionem, quam acquisiverunt' significat omnia quae sunt vera sensualia:  'et animam 
quam fecerant in Haran' significat omne essentiale vivum quod dabile in statu illo obscuro:  'et exiverunt ad eundum in terram Canaan' significat quod ita pergeret ad amoris caelestia:  'et venerunt in 
terram Canaan' significat quod ad caelestia amoris pervenit. </p>
