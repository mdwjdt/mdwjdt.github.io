<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>531.</strong>“为我们的操作和手中的劳苦安慰我们。这操作劳苦是因为耶和华咒诅地”指教义，已被毁坏的藉着教义被恢复。蒙主慈悲，这一点也将在后文阐述。“操作”表若不经历艰难困苦，他们无法直觉何为真。“耶和华咒诅之地带给我们手中的劳苦”表他们无力行善。这就是对“拉麦”或一个荒废教会的描述。当人凭自己或自我求真行善时，就有了“操作和劳苦”。结果就是“耶和华咒诅之地”，即无非是假与恶。关于“耶和华咒诅”的含义，请参阅245节。“安慰”是指拉麦的儿子，或挪亚，他表示一个新生代，因而表示一个新教会，也就是古教会。该教会或挪亚也表平安和平安带来的安慰，正如上古教会是指第七日，主在此日安息（参阅<a href="84.htm">84</a>-<a href="88.htm">88</a>节）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]531.</strong> The symbolism of consoling us for our work and for the distress of our hands from the ground, which Jehovah cursed, as the doctrine that was to restore what had been perverted will also, by the Lord's divine mercy, be seen in what follows.{*1} Work means that such people could not perceive what was true without a great deal of effort and anguish. The distress of our hands from the ground, which Jehovah cursed, means that they were unable to do anything good. This is how Lamech, or the church that lay in ruins, is described. The work and labor of our hands is when people have to rely on themselves or their own powers to find out what is true or do what is good. Anything that then results is the ground that Jehovah cursed, that is, something entirely false and evil. For what it means to say that Jehovah curses, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_531/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_245" target=_top>245</a>.<br />Consoling, however, relates to the son, Noah, who symbolizes a new rebirth and so a new church, which is the ancient church. This church, or Noah, also symbolizes a time of rest{*2} and the consolation that comes with rest, just as it was said of the earliest church that it was the seventh day — the day of the Lord's rest (see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_531/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_84" target=_top>84-88</a>).<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Although Swedenborg gives no further explanation for this biblical phrase, the role of the people meant by "Noah," who embraced "the doctrine that was to restore what had been perverted," and the spiritual changes taking place during that time are major focuses of the exegesis of Genesis chapters 6 through 9. See especially <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_531/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_596" target=_top>596-598</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_531/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_607" target=_top>607-609</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_531/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_640" target=_top>640</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_531/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_736" target=_top>736</a>. [JSR]<br />{*2} Swedenborg is drawing a connection between the name Noah and a Hebrew word for rest, נוּחַ (nûaḥ). See also note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_531/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_459" target=_top>459</a> on the text of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_531/bible_king-james-version_genesis_5_29" target=_top>Genesis 5:29</a>.

That by "comforting us from our work and the toil of our hands, out of the ground which Jehovah hath cursed" is signified doctrine, whereby what had been perverted would be restored, will also appear, 
of the Lord's Divine mercy, in the following pages. By "work" is signified that they could not perceive what is true except with labor and distress. By the "toil of the hands out of the ground which 
Jehovah hath cursed" is signified that they could do nothing good. Thus is described "Lamech" that is, the vastated church. There is "work and labor of the hands" when, from themselves or from their 
Own, men must seek out what is true and do what is good. That which comes of this is the "ground which Jehovah hath cursed" that is, nothing comes of it but what is false and evil. (But what is signified 
by "Jehovah cursing" may be seen above, n. 245.) To "comfort" has reference to the "son" or Noah, whereby is signified a new regeneration, thus a new church, which is the Ancient Church. By this church, 
or "Noah" is therefore likewise signified rest, and comfort that comes from rest, just as it was said of the Most Ancient Church that it was the seventh day, in which the Lord rested. (See n. 84-88.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 531</b></p><p><b>531.</b>
'Comfort us from our work and from the toil of our hands that comes from the ground which Jehovah has cursed' means the doctrine by which what had been corrupted would be restored. This too, in the Lord's 
Divine mercy, will be clear from what will come later on. 'Work' means their inability to perceive what truth was without toil and distress. 'The toil of our hands that comes from the ground which 
Jehovah has cursed' means their inability to do anything good. Such is the description of Lamech or a vastated Church. 'The work and the toil of our hands' is when people must from themselves or the 
proprium inquire after what truth is and do what is good. And the outcome is 'the ground which Jehovah has cursed', that is, nothing but falsity and evil. For the meaning of 'Jehovah curses', see <a href="245.htm">245</a>. 
'To comfort' however refers to Lamech's son, or Noah, who means new regeneration, and so a new Church, which was the Ancient Church. This Church or Noah also means peace and the comfort that peace 
brings, just as the Most Ancient Church is referred to as the seventh day on which the Lord rested; see <a href="84.htm">84</a>-<a href="88.htm">88</a>.  </p>

</p><b>531.</b>
Quod per 'consolari nos ab opere nostro, et a dolore manuum nostrarum ex humo, cui maledixit Jehovah' significetur doctrina qua restitueretur quod perversum, etiam ex sequentibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, 
constabit: per 'opus' significatur quod non nisi cum labore et angustia percipere possent quid veram; per 'dolorem manuum ex humo, cui maledixit Jehovah' quod nihil bonum facere possent ita 
describitur 'Lamech,' seu Ecclesia vastata: 'opus et labor manuum nostrarum' est cum ex semet aut proprio debeant inquirere quid verum et facere quod bonum; quod inde fit, est 'humus cui maledixit 
Jehovah,' hoc est, quod nihil nisi falsum et malum: sed quid significat quod 'maledicat Jehovah,' videatur n. 245.  At 'consolari,' se refert ad filium, seu Noahum, quo significatur nova regeneratio, 
ita nova Ecclesia, quae est Antiqua; per quam seu per 'Noahum' significatur ideo quoque requies, et ex requie solatium, sicut de Antiquissima Ecclesia, quod septimus dies in quo Dominus quievit, videatur n. 84-88. </p>
