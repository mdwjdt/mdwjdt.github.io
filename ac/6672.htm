Verses 15-21. And the king of Egypt said to the midwives of the Hebrew women, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah; and he said, When ye do the office of a midwife 
to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him; and if it be a daughter, then she shall live. And the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt 
spoke to them, and they kept the boys alive. And the king of Egypt called the midwives, and said to them, Wherefore do ye this word, and keep the boys alive? And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because 
the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are living, and they have brought forth before the midwife comes unto them. And God did well to the midwives; and the people was multiplied and 
became very numerous. And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that He made them houses. "And the king of Egypt said to the midwives of the Hebrew women," signifies influx from the separated 
memory-knowledges into the natural, where the true memory-knowledges of the church are; "of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah," signifies the quality and state 
of the natural where memory-knowledges are; "and he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools," signifies a discernment of the truth and good flowing 
in from the internal into memory-knowledges; "if it be a son, then ye shall kill him," signifies if it is truth, that they should destroy it in any way they could; "and if it be a daughter, then she 
shall live," signifies that they should not do so if it is good; "and the midwives feared God," signifies that true memory-knowledges were guarded because by the Divine; "and did not as the king of Egypt 
spoke to them," signifies that it was not done as they who were in falsities intended; "and they kept the boys alive," signifies that truths being of good were preserved; "and the king of Egypt called 
the midwives," signifies that they who were in falsities conspired against those who were in true memory-knowledges in the natural; "and said unto them, Wherefore do ye this word, and keep the boys 
alive?" signifies anger because truths were not destroyed; "and the midwives said unto Pharaoh," signifies a discernment of these true memory-knowledges in the natural; "Because the Hebrew women are 
not as the Egyptian women," signifies that the memory-knowledges of the church are not like the memory-knowledges opposed to them; "for they are living," signifies that spiritual life is in them; "and 
they have brought forth before the midwife comes unto them," signifies that the natural has no knowledge before they have life; "and God did well to the midwives," signifies that the natural was blessed 
by the Divine; "and the people was multiplied and became very numerous," signifies that truths therein were brought forth continually, and so increased; "and it came to pass, because the midwives 
feared God," signifies because true memory-knowledges were guarded by the Divine; "that He made them houses," signifies that they were disposed into the heavenly form. </p>

Verses 15-21 And the king of Egypt said to the midwives of the Hebrew women, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah - he said, When you act as midwives to the Hebrew 
women and see them on the birthstools, if it is a son you shall kill him; and if it is a daughter, let her live. And the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt spoke to them; and they 
kept the boys alive. And the king of Egypt called the midwives, and said to them, Why do you act like that and keep the boys alive? And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not 
like the Egyptian women, for they are full of life; before the midwife comes to them they have given birth. And God dealt well with the midwives; and the people multiplied and became very numerous. 
And so it was, because the midwives feared God, that He made them houses.  </p>
<p>'And the king of Egypt said to the midwives of the Hebrew women means an influx from separated factual knowledge into the 
natural where the Church's true factual knowledge resided. 'Of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah' means the nature and state of the natural where that factual knowledge 
resided. 'He said, When you act as midwives to the Hebrew women and see them on the birthstools' means a discernment of the truth and good flowing from the internal into that factual knowledge. 'If 
it is a son you shall kill him' means that if it was a form of truth, they were to destroy it in whatever way they could. 'And if it is a daughter, let her live' means that they were not to destroy 
it if it was a form of good.' And the midwives feared God' means that true factual knowledge was kept safe because it was kept so by the Divine. 'And did not do as the king of Egypt spoke to them' means 
that the intention of those under the influence of falsities was not carried out. 'And they kept the boys alive' means that the truths, being the truths of good, were preserved. 'And the king of Egypt 
called the midwives means that those under the influence of falsities planned a course of action against those who had true factual knowledge in the natural. 'And said to them, Why do you act like 
that and keep the boys alive?' means anger that the truths were not destroyed. 'And the midwives said to Pharaoh' means a discernment regarding that true factual knowledge in the natural. 'Because the 
Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women' means that the Church's factual knowledge is not like the factual knowledge which is at odds with it. 'For they are full of life' means that it has spiritual 
life within it. 'Before the midwife comes to them they have given birth' means that the natural knows nothing until life is imparted to it. 'And God dealt well with the midwives' means that the 
natural was blessed by the Divine. 'And the people multiplied and became very numerous' means that within the natural, truths were constantly emerging and so increasing. 'And so it was, because the midwives 
feared God' means because true factual knowledge was being kept safe by the Divine. 'That He made them houses' means that they were arranged into a heavenly form. </p>

Vers. 15-21.  Et dixit rex Aegypti obstetricibus Hebraearum, quarum nomen unius Schiphra, et nomen alterius Puah.  Et dixit, In obstetricando vos Hebraeis, et videritis super sellis, si filius ille, 
et occidetis (x)illum, et si filia illa, et vivat.  Et timebant obstetrices Deum, et non fecerunt quemadmodum locutus ad (x)illas rex Aegypti, et vivificabant pueros.  Et vocavit rex Aegypti obstetrices, 
et dixit illis, Quapropter facitis verbum istud, et vivificatis pueros?  Et dicebant obstetrices ad Pharaonem, Quia non sicut mulieres Aegyptiae, Hebraeae, quia viventes illae; antequam venit ad eas 
obstetrix, et pepererunt.  Et benefecit Deus obstetricibus, et multiplicabatur populus, et numerosi facti valde.  Et fuit, quia timuerunt obstetrices Deum, et fecit illis domos.  `Et dixit rex Aegypti 
obstetricibus Hebraearum' significat influxum ex scientificis {1}separatis in naturale ubi vera scientifica quae Ecclesiae: `quarum nomen unius Schiphra, et nomen alterius Puah' significat quale et 
statum naturalis ubi {2} scientifica: `et dixit, In obstetricando vos (x)Hebraeis, et videritis super sellis' significat apperceptionem influentis veri et boni ab interno in scientifica: `si filius 
ille, et occidetis illum' significat si verum, quod quo modo possent, destruerent: `et si filia illa, et vivat' significat quod non si bonum: `et timebant obstetrices Deum' significat quod vera scientifica, 
quia a Divino, custodirentur: `et non fecerunt, quemadmodum locutus ad (x)illas rex Aegypti' significat quod non ita factum sicut intendebant qui in falsis: `et vivificabant pueros' significat 
quod vera quia boni conservarentur: `et (x)vocavit rex Aegypti obstetrices' significat quod consilium inirent illi qui in falsis contra illos qui in veris scientificis in naturali: `et dixit illis, Quapropter 
facitis verbum istud, et vivificatis pueros?' significat iracundiam quod vera non destruerentur: `et dicebant obstetrices ad Pharaonem' significat apperceptionem de veris illis scientificis in 
naturali: `Quia non sicut mulieres Aegyptiae, Hebraeae' significat quod talia non sint scientifica Ecclesiae, qualia scientifica illis contraria: `quia viventes illae' significat quod in illis vita 
spiritualis: `illae antequam venit ad eas obstetrix, et pepererunt' significat quod naturale non sciat antequam illis vita: `et benefecit Deus obstetricibus' significat quod naturali a Divino benedictum 
sit: `et multiplicabatur populus, et numerosi facti valde' significat quod vera inibi producerentur continue, et sic crescerent: `et fuit, quia timuerunt obstetrices Deum' significat quia vera scientifica 
a Divino custodiebantur: `et fecit illis domos' significat quod in caelestem formam disponerentur. 	@1 I o; A d separatis i abalienatis$ 	@2 i vera cp n. 6674$ </p>
