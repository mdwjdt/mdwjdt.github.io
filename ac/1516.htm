<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1516节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1516.</strong>我曾与灵人们谈论过味觉，他们声称他们没有味觉，但有一种他们藉此知道何为味道的东西，他们将其比作气味，不过，他们无法描述出来。这时，我想起味觉和嗅觉在第三种意义上是相通的，这从动物明显看出来。它们凭气味检查食物，由此知道这食物是否有营养并适合它们。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1516.</strong> I talked with some spirits about the sense of taste. They said they had no sense of taste but something else that allowed them to recognize flavor, which they compared to smell, although they could not describe it.<br />This recalled to my mind the fact that taste and smell come together in a third faculty, as can be seen from animals, which find their food by scent. The scent reveals to them whether a thing is their proper food and good for them. </p>

I have spoken with spirits about the sense of taste, which they said that they do not possess, but a something from which they know what taste is, and which they likened to an odor, but which they could 
not describe. It was brought to my recollection that taste and smell meet in a kind of third sense, as is evident also from animals which examine their food by the smell, from which they know whether 
it is wholesome and suitable for them. </p>

I have spoken to spirits about the sense of taste, which they said they did not have but instead something by which they nevertheless know what taste is like. They said that it was like an odor, which 
however they were unable to describe. I then recalled that taste and smell come together in a kind of third sense, as is also clear from animals who examine their food by smelling it and from this they 
are shown whether it is nourishing and suitable for them. </p>

</p><b>1516.</b>
Locutus cum spiritibus de sensu gustus, quem dixerunt se non habere, sed quoddam ex quo usque cognoscunt qualis gustus est, (x)quem assimilabant odori, quem tamen describere non potuerunt: in recordationem 
mihi revocatum quod gustus et olfactus in quodam tertio conveniant, ut constat quoque ab animalibus quae olfactu explorant victum, ex quo manifestum iis fit num iis salubris et conveniens. </p>
