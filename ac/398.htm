<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第398节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>398.</strong>“离开耶和华的面”表与爱之信的良善分离，对此，可查看对14节的解读。“住在挪得之地”表在真与善之外，这从“挪得”一词的含义明显可知，“挪得”表正在成为流浪者与逃亡者，“流浪者与逃亡者”表丧失真与善，可参看上文；“伊甸东边”表接近于心智的觉知部分，这部分原本由爱统治，或表接近于原本由仁统治的理性部分，这一点从论述“伊甸东边”的含义明显可知，即“东”就是主，“伊甸”就是爱。对上古教会之人来说，构成心智的意愿与觉知是一体；因为意愿是全部中的全部，所以觉知属于意愿。他们不区分意之爱和知之信，因为爱是全部中的全部，信就属于爱。但后来信与爱分离，如被称为“该隐”者所行的那样，意就不再掌权，并且由于在那部分心智中，觉知取代意愿、或信取代爱掌权，所以就说“住在伊甸东边”。如刚才所述，信以特别的方式被区分，也就是“立一个记号”来保存信，以服务人类。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]398.</strong> To see that going out from before Jehovah [or from Jehovah's face] means being cut off from the good inherent in a loving faith, review the comments above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_398/bible_king-james-version_genesis_4_14" target=_top>14</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_398/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_387" target=_top>387</a>]. The meaning of his living in the land of Nod as living outside truth and goodness is established by the meaning of the [Hebrew] word nod: to be a wanderer and fugitive.{*1} And being a wanderer and fugitive means being deprived of truth and goodness, as you can also see above [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_398/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_382" target=_top>382</a>].<br />Living to the east of Eden means living by the dictates of the intellectual part of the mind, where before love had reigned supreme; it is also living by the dictates of the rational mind, where before charity had reigned supreme. This is established by earlier statements [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_398/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_98" target=_top>98</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_398/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_101" target=_top>101</a>] concerning the symbolism of Eden's east, in which the east is identified with the Lord, and Eden, with love.<br />Among the people of the earliest church, the mind, composed of will and intellect, was unified. The will part of the mind was everything, with the result that the intellect belonged to the will. This was because they made no distinction between love (in the will) and faith (in the intellect), since love was everything and faith belonged to love. After faith was detached from love, however, as it was by those referred to as "Cain," the will no longer ruled in any form. But because in that kind of mind the intellect ruled in place of the will — that is, faith ruled in place of love — it says that Cain lived to the east of Eden. This was due to the singling out of faith (as just described) by the mark put on it to preserve it for the use of the human race.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The name Nod comes from נוֹד, nôḏ (Brown, Driver, and Briggs 1996, under II נוֹד), which comes from נוּד, nûḏ, "to wander."

That to "go out from the faces of Jehovah" signifies to be separated from the good of the faith of love may be seen in the explication of verse 14; that to "dwell in the land of Nod" signifies outside 
of truth and good, is evident from the signification of the word "Nod" which is to be a wanderer and a fugitive; and that to be "a wanderer and a fugitive" is to be deprived of truth and good, may be 
seen above. That "toward the east of Eden" signifies near the intellectual mind, where love had previously reigned, and also near the rational mind, where charity had previously reigned, is evident 
from what has been said of the signification of "the east of Eden" namely, that "the east" is the Lord, and "Eden" love. With the men of the Most Ancient Church, the mind, consisting of the will and the 
understanding, was one; for the will was the all in all, so that the understanding was of the will. This was because they made no distinction between love, which is of the will, and faith, which is 
of the understanding, because love was the all in all, and faith was of love. But after faith was separated from love, as was the case with those who were called "Cain" no will reigned any longer, and 
as in that mind the understanding reigned instead of the will, or faith instead of love, it is said that he "dwelt toward the east of Eden;" for as was just now observed faith was distinguished, or 
"had a mark set upon it" that it might be preserved for the use of mankind. </p>

'Going out from the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of Jehovah' means being separated from good present in faith and flowing from love - see what has been mentioned already at verse 14. 'He dwelt in the land of Nod' means outside 
truth and good. This is clear from the meaning of the name Nod, which is being a wanderer and a fugitive. As for a wanderer and a fugitive meaning someone who has been divested of truth and good, 
again see what has been mentioned already. 'Towards the east of Eden' means close to the understanding part of the mind, where love had reigned previously, and also close to the rational part, where 
charity had reigned previously. This is clear from what has been stated already about the meaning of 'the east of Eden', namely that 'the east' is the Lord and 'Eden' love. With members (vir) of the Most 
Ancient Church, the mind, consisting of will and understanding, was one. In fact the will was everything, and the understanding consequently part of that will, the reason being that no division existed 
between love which belongs to the will and faith which belongs to the understanding. For love was everything, and faith part of that love. But after faith had been separated from love, as happened 
with those called Cain, it was no longer the will that reigned. But because the understanding ruled in that mind instead of the will, that is, faith instead of love, it is said that 'he dwelt towards 
the east of Eden'; for, as has just been stated, faith was distinguished in a special way. that is, 'had a sign placed on it', to preserve it for the use it still had to serve to the human race.

Quod 'exire a faciebus Jehovae' significet separari a bono fidei amoris, prius ad vers. 14 videas: quod 'habitaverit in terra Nod' significet extra verum et bonum, constat a significatione vocis 'Nod,' 
quod est vagus et profugus esse; et quod vagus et profugus sit privatus esse vero et bono, videatur etiam prius. Quod 'versus orientem Edenis' sit juxta mentem intellectualem, ubi prius regnavit amor; 
tum juxta mentem rationalem, ubi prius regnavit charitas, constat ex iis quae prius dicta sunt de significatione 'orientis Edenis', quod nempe 'oriens' sit Dominus, 'Eden' sit amor. Apud Ecclesiae 
Antiquissimae viros, mens, quam constituunt voluntas et intellectus, una erat; voluntas enim ibi erat omne, sic ut intellectus esset voluntatis, ex causa quia non distinguebatur inter amorem qui est 
voluntatis, et fidem quae intellectus, quia amor erat omne et fides erat amoris; sed postquam separabatur fides ab amore, ut apud eos qui vocabantur 'Cain,' non amplius voluntas aliqua regnabat; sed 
quia intellectus loco voluntatis, seu fides loco amoris, in mente illa regnaret, dicitur quod 'habitaverit versus orientem Edenis'; nam, ut modo dictum, distinguebatur fides, seu 'signum ponebatur,' ut 
conservaretur in usum generi humano. </p>
