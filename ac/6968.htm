<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6968节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6968.</strong>“看哪，手复原了，像别处的肉一样”表现在它是真理之良善。这从“肉”的含义清楚可知，“肉”是指，当一个人的自我被主的神性人身的自我，也就是天堂的自我复活时，人之自我的意愿那一面（参看<a href="3813.htm">3813</a>节）。由于这意愿由“肉”来表示，故所表示的是对主对邻之爱的良善。然而，在那些属于属灵教会的人当中，它是真理之良善，因为他们的良善是真理的产物，符合其教会教义的真理。当这真理成为人生活的一部分时，它就被称为良善。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6968</b></p><p><b>6968.</b>
And behold it was turned again as his flesh. That this signifies that then it was the good of truth, is evident from the signification of "flesh," as being what is man's own of his will, made alive by 
what is the Lord's own of His Divine Human, that is, what is one's own that is heavenly (see n. 3813); and because this is signified by "flesh," it is the good of love to the Lord and toward the neighbor 
which is signified. But with those who are of the spiritual church, it is the good of truth, because their good is from truth, and is according to the truth of the doctrine of their church. When 
this truth becomes of the life it is called good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6968</b></p><p><b>6968.</b>
'And behold, it was restored like his [other] flesh' means that now it was the good of truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'flesh' as the will side of a person's proprium when it has been made alive 
by the Proprium of the Lord's Divine Human, which is a heavenly proprium, dealt with in <a href="3813.htm">3813</a>. And since this is meant by 'flesh', the good of love to the Lord and towards the neighbour is what is 
meant. Among those however who belong to the spiritual Church it is the good of truth, for with them good is the product of truth and accords with the truth as taught by their Church. When this truth 
becomes part of anyone's life it is called good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 6968</b>
</p><b>6968.</b>
`Et ecce reversa sicut caro illius': quod significet quod tunc bonum veri, constat ex significatione `carnis' quod sit proprium voluntarium hominis vivificatum a Proprio Divini Humani Domini, seu proprium 
caeleste, de qua n. 3813; et quia hoc per `carnem' significatur, est bonum amoris in Dominum et erga proximum quod significatur {1}; at apud illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali sunt est bonum veri, 
nam bonum apud illos est ex vero et secundum verum doctrinae Ecclesiae eorum, hoc verum cum fit vitae, vocatur bonum. 	@1 i, nam per hoc bonum vivificatur homo a Domino$ </p>
