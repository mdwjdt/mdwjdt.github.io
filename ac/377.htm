<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>377.</strong>“地”在此表分裂或异端，这一点从以下事实清楚可知，即“田”表教义，所以有田在其中的“地”就是分裂。人自身是“地”，也是“田”，因为这些东西在人内被“耕种”。事实上，里面种什么，就是什么样的人，种下善与真，就是真实与善良的人；种下恶与假，就是虚伪与邪恶的人。凡处于某一特定教义或异端者，就以该教义或异端来命名，所以“地”在此表人内的分裂或异端。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]377.</strong> The symbolism of the ground here as a schism or heresy can be established by the symbolism of a field. Since a field symbolizes doctrine, the ground containing the field is a schism.<br />We ourselves are also the ground, and a field too, because doctrine and heresy have been sown in us. Our character comes from the seeds we are sown with. Good, true seed makes us good and true, and evil, false seed makes us evil and false. Those who attach themselves to a particular doctrine are named for that doctrine; those who participate in a schism or heresy are named for that. So the ground here stands for the schism or heresy that is in a person. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 377</b></p><p><b>377.</b>
That the "ground" here signifies a schism or heresy, is evident from the fact that a "field" signifies doctrine, and therefore the "ground" having the field in it, is a schism. Man himself is the "ground" 
and also the "field" because these things are inseminated in him, for man is man from what is inseminated in him, a good and true man from goods and truths, an evil and false man from evils and 
falsities. He who is in any particular doctrine or heresy is named from it, and so in the passage before us the term "ground" is used to denote a schism or heresy in man. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 377</b></p><p><b>377.</b>
'The ground' here means schism or heresy. This is clear from the fact that 'a field' means doctrine, and therefore 'the ground' of which the field is a part is schism. Man himself is meant by 'the ground' 
as well as by 'the field' because these things are sown within him. Indeed it is by virtue of what is sown within that anyone is man. Anyone who is good and true is so by virtue of goods and truths; 
anyone evil and false is so by virtue of evils and falsities. Anyone who subscribes to a particular system of doctrine is referred to by the name of that system, as is anyone who subscribes to a 
particular schism or heresy; and so 'ground' at this point stands for schism or heresy within man.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 377</b>
</p><b>377.</b>
Quod 'humus' significet hic schisma seu haeresin, constat inde quod 'ager' significet doctrinam, quare 'humus' in qua ager, est schisma: ipse homo est 'humus,' ut et 'ager,' quia ei inseminantur illa; 
nam homo est ab iis quae inseminata sunt; bonus et verus a bonis et veris; malus et falsus a malis et falsis; qui in doctrina aliqua, inde vocatur; qui in schismate seu haeresi, inde vocatur; ita hic 
'humus' pro schismate seu haeresi quae in homine. </p>
