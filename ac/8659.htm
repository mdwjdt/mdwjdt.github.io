Verses 6, 7. And he said unto Moses, I thy father-in-law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her. And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and bowed himself down, and kissed 
him; and they asked a man his companion as to peace; and they came into the tent. "And he said unto Moses," signifies influx and the derivative perception; "I thy father-in-law Jethro am come unto 
thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her," signifies Divine goods in their order; "and Moses went out to meet his father-in-law," signifies the application of truth Divine to Divine good; "and 
bowed himself down," signifies immission;* "and kissed him," signifies conjunction; "and they asked a man his companion as to peace," signifies a natural Divine celestial state; "and they came into the 
tent," signifies the holiness of the union. * "Immission" is the correlative of "emission," and is found in Heaven and Hell n. 551e, and Apocalypse Explained n. 503:4. The verb immittere, in the sense 
of "to let into," is rather frequently used by Swedenborg. [REVISER.] </p>

<p>'And he said to Moses' means influx and resulting perception. 'I your father-in-law Jethro come to you, and your wife, 
and her two sons with her' means levels of God's good in their order. 'And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law' means God's truth being brought to Divine Good. 'And bowed down' means being brought 
into contact with it. 'And kissed him' means being joined to it. 'And they asked, a man his companion, as regards peace' means the mutual, Divine celestial state. 'And they came into the tent' means 
the holiness of union.

Vers. 6, 7.  Et dixit ad Moschen, Ego socer tuus Jethro venio ad te, et uxor tua, et duo filii ejus cum illa.  Et exivit Moscheh obviam socero suo, et incurvavit se, et osculatus illum; et interrogabant 
vir socium Suum ad pacem; et venerunt in tentorium.  `Et dixit ad Moschen' significat influxum et inde perceptionem: `Ego socer tuus Jethro venio ad te, et uxor tua, et duo filii ejus cum illa' significat 
bona Divina in ordine: `et exivit Moscheh obviam socero suo' significat applicationem veri Divini ad Divinum Bonum: `et incurvavit se' significat immissionem: `et osculatus illum' significat 
conjunctionem: `et interrogabant vir socium ad pacem' significat statum Divinum caelestem mutuum: `et venerunt in tentorium' significat sanctum unionis. </p>
