But what is involved in the internal sense in these things which the Lord here says concerning the Last Judgment, that is, concerning the last judgment of everyone after death, is too much to be unfolded 
before this chapter, and therefore will of the Lord's Divine mercy be unfolded in order before the chapters which follow.            GENESIS 37 </p>
<p>     1. And Jacob dwelt in the land of his father's 
sojournings, in the land of Canaan.      2. These are the births of Jacob. Joseph, a son of seventeen years, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and he was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and 
with the sons of Zilpah his father's women; and Joseph brought their evil report unto their father.      3. And Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, because he was the son of his old age; and 
he made him a tunic of various colors.      4. And his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren; and they hated him, and could not speak for peace unto him.      5. And 
Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren, and they added yet to hate him.      6. And he said unto them, Hear I pray this dream which I have dreamed; </p>
<p>     7. And behold we were binding 
sheaves in the midst of the field, and lo my sheaf arose, and also stood upright, and behold your sheaves came round about, and bowed down themselves to my sheaf.      8. And his brethren said to him, 
Shalt thou indeed reign over us? Or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they added yet to hate him for his dreams, and for his words.      9. And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it 
to his brethren, and said, Behold I have dreamed yet a dream, and behold the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down themselves to me.      10. And he told it to his father, and to his brethren; 
and his father rebuked him, and said to him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?      11. And 
his brethren envied him, but his father kept the word.      12. And his brethren went to feed the flock of their father in Shechem.      13. And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the 
flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Behold me!      14. And he said to him, Go I pray, see the peace of thy brethren, and the peace of the flock, and bring me 
word again. And he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.      15. And a man found him, and behold he was wandering in the field; and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?  
    16. And he said, I seek my brethren, tell me I pray where they are feeding the flock.      17. And the man said, They are departed hence, for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph 
went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.      18. And they saw him afar off, and before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to cause him to die.      19. And they said a 
man to his brother, Behold this lord of dreams cometh.      20. Come now therefore and let us slay him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, An evil wild beast hath devoured him; and 
we shall see what his dreams will be.      21. And Reuben heard, and rescued him out of their hand, and said, Let us not smite him, the soul.      22. And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood; cast 
him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him; that he might rescue him out of their hand, to bring him back to his father.      23. And it came to pass when Joseph was come unto 
his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the tunic of various colors that was on him; </p>
<p>     24. And they took him, and cast him into the pit; and the pit was empty, there was no water 
in it.      25. And they sat down to eat bread, and they lifted up their eyes and saw, and behold a company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead, with their camels bearing spices and balsam and stacte, going 
to carry them down to Egypt.      26. And Judah said unto his brethren, What gain is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?      27. Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and 
let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brethren harkened unto him.      28. And there passed by men, Midianites, merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of 
the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they brought Joseph into Egypt.      29. And Reuben returned unto the pit, and behold Joseph was not in the pit, and he 
rent his garments.      30. And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither do I come?      31. And they took Joseph's tunic, and killed a he-goat of the goats, and dipped 
the tunic in the blood; </p>
<p>     32. And they sent the tunic of various colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, This have we found; know now whether it be thy son's tunic or not.     
 33. And he knew it, and said, It is my son's tunic; an evil wild beast hath devoured him; Joseph is surely torn in pieces.      34. And Jacob rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and 
mourned over his son many days.      35. And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to comfort himself, and he said, For I shall go down to the grave to my son, mourning. 
And his father wept for him.      36. And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, Pharaoh's chamberlain, prince of the guards. </p>

But what is embodied within the internal sense of the things stated by the Lord in this passage about the last judgement, that is, about each person's judgement after death, would take far too long to 
explain in this preliminary section of the chapter. Therefore they will in the Lord's Divine mercy be explained in order in the preliminary sections of the chapters following this one. </p>

Quid autem illa quae ibi Dominus de ultimo judicio, hoc est, de ultimo cujusvis post mortem, loquitur, in sensu interno involvunt, prolixiora sunt quam ut ante hoc caput explicentur, quapropter,

<p>                          CAPUT XXXVII      1.  Et habitavit Jacob in terra peregrinationum patris sui in terra Canaan.  
    2.  Hae nativitates Jacobi; Joseph filius septendecim annorum fuit pascens cum fratribus suis gregem, et is puer, cum filiis Bilhae et cum filiis Zilpae, feminarum patris sui: et adduxit Joseph 
malam famam illorum ad patrem illorum.      3.  Et Israel amavit Josephum prae omnibus filiis suis, quia filius senectutum is ei, et fecit ei tunicam variorum colorum.      4.  Et viderunt 
fratres ejus quod eum amavit pater illorum prae omnibus fratribus ejus, et oderunt eum, et non potuerunt loqui ei ad pacem.      5.  Et somniavit Joseph somnium, et indicavit fratribus suis, et 
addiderunt adhuc odisse illum.      6.  Et dixit ad illos, Audite quaeso somnium hoc quod somniavi.      7. Et ecce nos manipulantes manipulos in medio agri, et ecce  surrexit manipulus meus, et etiam 
constitit, et ecce circumdederunt manipuli vestri, et incurvaverunt se manipulo meo.      8.  Et dixerunt ei fratres ejus, An regnando regnabis super nos? si dominando dominaberis in nos? et addiderunt 
adhuc odisse eum super somnia ejus, et super verba ejus.      9.  Et somniavit adhuc somnium alterum, et narravit illud fratribus suis, et dixit, Ecce somniavi somnium adhuc, et ecce sol et 
luna, et undecim stellae incurvantes se mihi.      10.  Et narravit ad patrem suum, et ad fratres suos, et increpavit eum pater ejus, et dixit ei, Quid somnium hoc quod somniasti? an veniendo veniemus 
ego et mater tua, et fratres tui, ad incurvandum nos tibi terram?      11.  Et inviderunt ei fratres ejus; et pater ejus custodivit verbum.      12.  Et iverunt fratres ejus ad pascendum gregem 
patris illorum in Shechem.      13.  Et dixit Israel ad Josephum, Nonne fratres tui pascentes in Shechem? vade et mittam te ad illos, et dixit ei, Ecce me.      14.  Et dixit ei, Vade quaeso, 
vide pacem fratrum tuorum, et pacem gregis, et reduc mihi verbum; et misit eum e valle Hebronis, et venit Shechemum.      15.  Et invenit eum vir, et ecce errans in agro, et interrogavit eum vir, 
dicendo, Quid quaeris?      16.  Et dixit, Fratres meos ego quaerens, indica quaeso mihi, ubi illi pascentes.      17.  Et dixit vir, Profecti abhinc, quia audivi dicentes, Eamus Dothanem; et ivit 
Joseph post fratres suos, et invenit illos in Dothan.      18.  Et viderunt eum e longinquo, et antequam appropinquavit ad illos, et machinati sunt ei ad mori faciendum eum.      19.  Et dixerunt 
vir ad fratrem suum, Ecce dominus somniorum iste venit.      20.  Et nunc ite et occidamus eum, et mittamus eum in unam fovearum, et dicamus, Fera mala comedit eum; et videbimus quid erunt somnia 
ejus.      21.  Et audivit Reuben, et eripuit eum e manu illorum, et dixit, Non percutiamus eum, anima.      22.  Et dixit ad illos Reuben, Ne effundatis sanguinem, mittite eum ad foveam illam 
quae in deserto, et manum ne mittatis in eum; propterea ut eriperet eum e manu illorum, ad reducendum eum ad patrem ejus.      23.  Et factum sicut venit Josephus ad fratres suos, et exuebant Josephum 
tunica sua, tunica variorum colorum quae super eum.      24.  Et sumpserunt eum, et miserunt eum in foveam, et fovea vacua, nulla in illa aqua.      25.  Et sederunt ad comedendum panem, et sustulerunt 
oculos suos, et viderunt, et ecce comitatus Jishmaelitarum venit e Gilead, et cameli illorum ferentes aromata, et resinam, et stacten, euntes ad deferendum ad Aegyptum.      26.  Et dixit 
Jehudah ad fratres suos, Quid lucri quod occidamus fratrem nostrum, et obtegamus sanguinem ejus?      27.  Ite et vendamus eum Jishmaelitis, et manus nostra ne sit in eum, quia frater noster caro 
nostra is; et auscultarunt fratres illius.      28.  Et transiverunt viri Midianitae negotiatores, et extraxerunt et ascendere fecerunt Josephum e fovea, et vendiderunt Josephum Jishmaelitis in 
viginti argenti; et adduxerunt Josephum Aegyptum.      29.  Et rediit Reuben ad foveam, et ecce nullus Joseph in fovea: et discidit vestes suas.      30.  Et rediit ad fratres suos, et dixit, Natus 
non amplius, et ego quo ego venio?      31.  Et sumpserunt tunicam Josephi, et mactarunt hircum caprarum, et intinxerunt tunicam in sanguine.      32.  Et miserunt tunicam variorum colorum, et adduxerunt 
ad patrem illorum, et dixerunt, Hanc invenimus, agnosce quaeso an tunica filii tui haec, si non.      33.  Et agnovit illam, et dixit, Tunica filii mei, fera mala comedit eum, discerpendo 
discerptus est Joseph.      34.  Et discidit Jacob vestes suas, et posuit saccum in lumbis suis, et luxit super filio suo diebus multis.      35.  Et surrexerunt omnes filii ejus, et omnes filiae 
ejus, ad consolandum eum, et renuit ad consolandum se, et dixit, Quia descendam ad filium meum lugens sepulcrum; et flevit eum pater ejus.      36. Et Midianitae vendiderunt eum ad Aegyptum Potiphari cubiculario 
Pharaonis, principi satellitum. </p>
