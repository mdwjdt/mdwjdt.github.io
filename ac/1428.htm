<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1428节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1428.</strong>“罗得也和他同去”表感官知觉。“罗得”表主的感官肉体人，这从下文罗得的代表清楚可知。下文说到，他与亚伯兰分离，并被天使拯救；但后来，一旦完成分离，罗得就具有另外的代表，对此，蒙主怜悯，容后再述。显然，主和其他人一样出生，不过，祂是从童女母亲出生的，祂也和其他人一样拥有感官知觉和肉体欲望，但祂不同于其他人之处在于：祂的感官知觉和肉体欲望最终与属天事物结合，并成为神性。主的感官知觉和肉体欲望由罗得代表，或换句话说，罗得代表的是主在童年状态时的感官肉体人，而不是藉着属天事物与神性结合后的感官肉体人。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1428.</strong> And with him went Lot symbolizes the senses; Lot represents the Lord as a sensory, physical being. This can be seen from Lot's representation in what follows, where the discussion focuses on him in his separation from Abram and in his rescue by angels [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1428/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1547" target=_top>1547</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1428/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2324" target=_top>2324</a>]. (Later, after his separation from Abram, Lot takes on another representation, as will be described below [搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1428/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2324" target=_top>2324</a>], the Lord in his divine mercy willing.)<br />Clearly the Lord was born like any other person to a human mother 钬?a virgin one 钬?and had senses and a physical presence like other people's. He was not like others, though, in this: the sensory, physical component in him eventually united with heavenly attributes and became divine. Lot represents what belonged exclusively to the Lord's body and senses or, to say the same thing, the Lord's sensory, physical self as it was when he was a youth, not as it came to be when united with his divinity by means of heavenly qualities. </p>

And Lot went with him. That this signifies what is sensuous, and that by "Lot" is represented the Lord as to His sensuous and corporeal man, is evident from the representation of Lot in what follows, 
where it is said that he was separated from Abram, and was saved by angels; but afterwards, when he was separated, Lot put on another representation, concerning which, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. 
It is evident that the Lord was born as are other men, but of a virgin mother, and that He possessed what is sensuous and corporeal as do other men; but He differed from other men in the fact that 
His sensuous and corporeal was afterwards united to celestial things, and was made Divine. The Lord's sensuous and corporeal itself, or what is the same, His sensuous and corporeal man, as it was 
in His state of childhood-not as it became when united by means of celestial things to the Divine-is represented by Lot. </p>

'And Lot went with him' means sensory perception. That 'Lot' represents the Lord as regards His sensory and bodily man becomes clear from the representation of 'Lot' in what follows, where his being 
separated from Abram and being saved by angels is described. Later on however, once the separation had taken place, Lot takes on another representation, which will in the Lord's Divine mercy be dealt 
with later on. It is clear that the Lord was born like any other, though from a woman who was a virgin, and that He had sensory perception and bodily desires like any other, but that He differed from 
any other in that sensory perception and bodily desires were eventually united to celestial things and made Divine. The Lord's actual sensory perception and bodily desires are represented by Lot, or what 
amounts to the same, His sensory and bodily man as it was during His state of childhood and not as it became once it had been united to the Divine by means of celestial things. </p>

</p><b>1428.</b>
'Et ivit cum illo Lot':  quod significet sensuale, quodque per 'Lot' repraesentetur Dominus quoad sensualem et corporeum Ipsius hominem, constare potest a repraesentatione Loti in sequentibus, ubi de 
illo agitur quod separatus sit ab Abramo quodque salvatus per angelos:  at Lotus postea cum separatus est, induit aliam repraesentationem, de qua, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus.  Quod 
Dominus natus sicut alius homo a virgine muliere, et Ipsi sensuale et corporeum fuerit sicut alii homini, constat; sed in illo quod Ipsius sensuale et corporeum dein unitum caelestibus et factum Divinum, 
non fuit sicut alius homo; Ipsum Domini sensuale et corporeum repraesentatur per Lotum, seu quod idem est, Ipsius homo sensualis et corporeus sicut fuit in statu Ipsius pueritiae, non sicut factum, 
cum unitum per caelestia Divino. </p>
