<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7935节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7935.</strong>“将来你们的儿子问你们说”表对真理的内在觉知，这觉知属于良知。这从“说”和“儿子”的含义清楚可知：“说”是指觉知，如前所述（<a href="7913.htm">7913</a>节）；“儿子”是指真理（<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>，<a href="2623.htm">2623</a>，<a href="3373.htm">3373</a>，<a href="4257.htm">4257</a>节）。之所以表示属于良知的内在觉知，是因为此处所论述的主题是被主释放的属灵教会成员今后的状态或未来的状态。在这种状态下，这一真理必须牢牢留在他们脑海中：唯独主应得到救赎他们的功劳。对该真理的觉知属于良知，因为属灵教会成员没有属天教会成员那样的觉知，取而代之的是拥有良知。与他们同在的良知是从他们出生在其中的教会的真理那里生出并形成的。他们在童年及以后一直学习这些真理，并在生活中确认它们，由此把它们变成信之真理。照这些真理行事就是照良知行事，违背它们行事就是违背良知行事。它们被嵌入内部记忆，如同写进这记忆中，最终变得像是在童年最早期就被烙印上的东西，之后又显得十分熟悉，可以说是与生俱来的，就像人的说话、思考和反思各种事的能力，又像他走路、打手势、运用面部表情的身体能力，以及许多他生来没有，但通过习惯所获得的其它能力。当信之真理以这种方式被烙印上（这发生在内层人中）时，它们同样变得熟悉，最终仿佛成了与生俱来的，由此迫使这个人照它们思考、意愿并行事。他生命里的这种驱动力被称为良知，就是属灵人的生命；这种生命要照着纯正的信之真理在多大程度上成为其思维的源头，纯正的仁之良善在多大程度上成为其行为的源头，以及它们在多大程度上起主导作用来评估。从整个思路也明显可知，此处这些话表示属于良知的内在觉知。</p>

And it shall be, when your sons shall say unto you. That this signifies the interior perception of truth, which perception is of conscience, is evident from the signification of "to say," as being perception 
(of which above, n. 7913); and from the signification of "sons," as being truths (n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 3373, 4257). That it denotes the interior perception which is of conscience, is 
because the subject here treated of is the state hereafter or future of those who are of the spiritual church and are liberated by the Lord, in that this truth must remain fixed in their minds; that 
their salvation ought to be accepted as solely from the Lord. The perception of this truth is of conscience; for they who are of the spiritual church have not perception as have those who are of the celestial 
church, but in place of it they have conscience. Conscience with them is born and formed from the truths of the church wherein they have been born, which truths have been received by them in 
childhood and afterward, and have been confirmed by life, and in this way have become matters of faith. To act according to these truths is to act according to conscience, and to act contrary to them 
is to act contrary to conscience. They are fixed in the interior memory as if written there, and at last are so to speak things that have been impressed in infancy, which afterward appear quite familiar 
and as it were innate, just as do the speech, thoughts, recollections, various reflections, and, in external matters, the gait, gestures, countenance and other things into which one is not born, but 
is introduced by habits. When the truths of faith also have been impressed in this way, which takes place in the interior man, then they in like manner become familiar, and at last, being as it were 
innate, impel the man to think, to will, and to act according to them. This part of the life is called conscience, and is the life of the spiritual man, which is to be valued in proportion as the truths 
from which he thinks are genuine truths of faith, and as the goods from which he acts are genuine goods of charity. From the series in what follows it is also evident that by the above words is signified 
the interior perception which is of conscience. </p>

'And it shall be, when your children say to you' means the inward perception of truth that belongs to conscience. This is clear from the meaning of 'saying' as perception, dealt with above in <a href="7913.htm">7913</a>; and 
from the meaning of 'children' or 'sons' as truths, dealt with in <a href="489.htm">489</a>, <a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="573.htm">573</a>, <a href="1147.htm">1147</a>, <a href="2623.htm">2623</a>, <a href="3373.htm">3373</a>, <a href="4257.htm">4257</a>. The reason why the inward perception that belongs to conscience is meant is that reference is 
being made to the state from then on, or the future state, of members of the spiritual Church who have been delivered by the Lord. In that state the truth must be lodged firmly in their minds that the 
Lord alone should receive the credit for their salvation. The perception of this truth belongs to conscience, because members of the spiritual Church do not have the gift of perception such as those 
of the celestial Church have; instead they have conscience. Conscience existing with them is born and formed from the truths of the Church in which they were born. They have learned those truths in 
childhood and after it, and have endorsed them in life, thereby making them truths of faith. Acting in accordance with those truths is doing so in accordance with conscience, and acting contrary to them 
is doing so contrary to conscience. They are lodged in the interior memory as though written into it and ultimately come to be like those things which have been imprinted in earliest childhood and 
after that appear to be fully known and so to speak inborn. They appear to be like a person's ability to speak, think, recollect, and reflect on various things, and like his physical ability to walk, 
make gestures, and use facial expressions, and like many other abilities which he is not born with but acquires through habitual practice. When the truths of faith have been imprinted in that way too, 
which happens in the interior man, they likewise become fully known; and ultimately, when they have become as if inborn, they impel the person to think, will, and act in conformity with them. This driving 
force in his life is called conscience. It is the life of the spiritual man, and that life should be evaluated according to how far genuine truths of faith are the source of his thoughts and how 
far forms of the genuine good of charity are the source of his actions, and also to what extent they take the lead. From the whole train of thought too it is evident that the words at this point mean 
the inward perception that belongs to conscience.  </p>

`Et erit quod dixerint ad vos filii vestri': quod significet interiorem perceptionem veri quae conscientiae, constat ex significatione `dicere' quod sit perceptio, de qua supra n. 7913; et ex significatione 
`filiorum' quod sint vera, de qua n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 3373, 4257; quod sit perceptio interior quae conscientiae, est quia agitur de statu posthac seu futuro illorum qui ab Ecclesia 
spirituali, et liberati a Domino, quod mentibus illorum insidebit {1}id verum, quod salvatio illorum unice accepta debeatur Domino; hujus veri perceptio est conscientiae; qui enim ab Ecclesia spirituali 
sunt non perceptionem {2} habent prout {3}illi qui ab Ecclesia caelesti, sed loco illius habent conscientiam.  (s)Conscientia apud illos nascitur et formatur ex veris Ecclesiae in qua nati sunt, quae 
in pueritia et postea hauserunt et vita confirmarunt, et sic fidei facta sunt; secundum illa vera agere est secundum conscientiam, et contra illa agere est contra conscientiam; insident memoriae interiori 
sicut inscripta, et demum quasi illa quae in infantia impressa sunt, quae apparent postea prorsus familiaria et sicut innata; quemadmodum {4}sunt loquelae, cogitationes, reminiscentiae, reflexiones 
variae, et in externis gressus, gestus, vultus, et plura, in quae homo non nascitur sed per consuetudines inducitur; cum vera quae fidei ita quoque impressa sunt, quod fit in interiore homine, tunc 
illa similiter familiaria fiunt, (c)et demum sicut {5}innata agunt hominem ad cogitandum, volendum, et agendum secundum illa; hoc vitae vocatur conscientia, estque vita {6}hominis spiritualis quae 
tanti aestimanda {7}quanti sunt vera genuina quae fidei, ex quibus cogitat, et quantum sunt bona genuina quae charitatis, ex quibus agit, tum quantum illa ducunt.  Ex sequentium serie etiam patet quod
