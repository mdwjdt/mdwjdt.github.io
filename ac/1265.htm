<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1265节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1265.</strong>在头顶的某个高处，有很多灵人涌入我的思维，仿佛将它们束缚住，以致我处于非常模糊的状态。他们重重地压在我身上。我周围的灵人同样被他们束缚住，致使他们只能通过这些灵人所流入之物思考，甚至到了激起他们愤怒的地步。我被告知，头顶上的这些灵人就是生活在洪水前的人。不过，他们不属于灭亡的所谓拿非利人（即伟人），因为他们还没有那么强的说服力。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1265.</strong> The Pre-Flood People Who Died Out<br />SOME distance above my head was a crowd of people who were influencing my thoughts and holding them captive, so to speak, so that I was very much in the dark. They pressed down on me fairly heavily. The spirits around me were likewise being held more or less captive by them, so that they could hardly think anything that did not pour in from those others. The situation was severe enough to arouse the spirits' anger. Someone said that these were people who had lived before the Flood, although they were not the ones called Nephilim{*1} who had died out, because the Nephilim did not have such forceful persuasive powers.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The Nephilim are discussed at some length in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1265/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_581" target=_top>581</a>.

CONCERNING THE ANTEDILUVIANS WHO PERISHED.           At some height above the head there were a number of spirits who inflowed into my thoughts and kept them as it were bound, so that I was in very 
much obscurity. They pressed heavily upon me. The spirits about me were likewise held as it were bound by them, so that they could scarcely think, except that which inflowed from those spirits, and this 
to such a degree as to excite their indignation. It was said that the spirits in question were of those who had lived before the flood; but not of those called Nephilim, and who perished, for they 
were not so strongly persuasive. </p>

THOSE BEFORE THE FLOOD WHO PERISHED </p>
<p>At some height overhead many spirits were present who flowed into my thoughts and held them so to speak in bonds, so that I was very much in obscurity. They were 
pressing down on me quite strongly. The spirits around me were similarly held by them so to speak in bonds, and so were able to think little apart from that which flowed in from those overhead, and 
this was enough to make them angry. I was told that those overhead were people who had lived before the Flood, though they were not from those called Nephilim who perished, for their power of persuasion 
was not so strong as the latter's. </p>

</p><b>1265.</b>
De Antediluvianis qui perierunt </p>
<p>Supra caput ad aliquam altitudinem fuerunt plures qui influebant in cogitationes meas, et eas quasi vinctas tenebant ut essem admodum in obscuro; satis valide incumbebant; 
spiritus circum me similiter quasi vincti ab iis tenebantur, sic ut parum cogitare possent nisi quod ab iis influebat, et hoc usque ad indignationem; dictum quod ii essent qui ante diluvium vixerunt, 
sed non ab iis qui Nephilim dicti et perierunt, nam illis non tam forte persuasivum. </p>
