Verses 50-52. And to Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath the daughter of Potiphera priest of On bare to him. And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh; For 
God hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house. And the name of the second called he Ephraim; For God hath made me fruitful in the land of my affliction. "And to Joseph were born two 
sons," signifies good and truth therefrom; "before the year of famine came," signifies that came through the natural; "whom Asenath the daughter of Potiphera priest of On bare to him," signifies that 
came from the marriage; "and Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh," signifies a new will in the natural, and its quality; "For God hath made me forget all my toil," signifies removal after 
temptations; "and all my father's house," signifies the removal of hereditary evils; "and the name of the second called he Ephraim," signifies a new understanding in the natural, and its quality; "For 
God hath made me fruitful," signifies the consequent multiplication of truth from good; "in the land of my affliction," signifies where temptations were suffered. </p>

Vers. 50-52.  Et Josepho natum duo filii, antequam venit annus famis, quos peperit ei Asenath filia Potipherae sacerdotis On. Et vocavit Joseph nomen primogeniti Menasheh, quia oblivisci (t)me fecit 
Deus omnis laboris mei, et omnis domus patris mei. Et nomen secundi vocavit Ephraim, quia fructificari fecit me Deus in terra afflictionis meae. `Et Josepho natum duo filii' significat inde bonum et
