<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8027节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8027.</strong>前面提到的在我左侧的那个灵人不时插话，尤其警告我对待他的天使要谦逊；因为一些来自我们地球的灵人有一种不讨人喜欢的行为表现方式。他还说，他不明白这些天使在说什么；直到后来他移到我的左耳才明白。那时，他的言语也不像之前那样刺耳了，而是和其他灵人的一样。</p>

The spirit above mentioned, who was on the left side, sometimes interrupted the conversation, admonishing me especially to deal discreetly with his angels; for there were spirits from our earth who occasioned 
such things as excited displeasure. He also said that he did not understand what the angels spoke; but that he did afterward when he removed to my left ear. His speech then was not harsh as 
before, but like that of other spirits.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8027</b></p><p><b>8027.</b>
The spirit spoken of above who was by my left side was from time to time interposing remarks. In particular he warned me to behave in an unassuming manner towards his angels; for there were spirits from 
our planet who had a way of displaying behaviour that would be displeasing. He also said that he could not understand what it was the angels were declaring, not until after he had moved up to my left 
ear. His speech then also ceased to be grating, as it had been before, becoming instead like that of other spirits. </p>

</p><b>8027.</b>
Spiritus qui a latere sinistro mecum erat, de quo supra, (x)quandoque interloquebatur, imprimis monens ut cum angelis suis modeste agerem; erant enim spiritus {1}ex nostra tellure qui inferebant talia 
quae displicerent; dicebat etiam quod non intellexerit quid {2}angeli loquebantur, sed quod postea, quando admotus auri meae sinistrae; tunc quoque ei loquela erat non stridens ut prius, sed qualis 
est aliis spiritibus. 	@1 hujus telluris$ 	@2 dicebant$ </p>
