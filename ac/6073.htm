<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6073节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6073.</strong>“你们作的是什么职业”表对服务和功用。这从“职业”的含义清楚可知，“职业”是指良善（<a href="6048.htm">6048</a>节），因而是指服务和功用，因为这些就是良善。被称为仁之良善的一切良善无非是功用或有用的服务，功用或有用的服务无非是为邻舍、祖国、教会和主国家所做的工作。此外，就本质而言，仁爱本身不会变成仁爱，除非它进入行为，成为一个工作或职业。因为爱某人，却在有能力时不向他行善，就不是真的爱他。在有能力时向他行善，并且发自内心如此行，就是在爱他；因为这时，实际行为或工作就包含了构成对他的仁爱的一切。事实上，人的工作包含了他的仁与信的方方面面，就是那被称为属灵良善的，并通过实践仁爱，也就是通过功用或有用的服务而变成良善。<br />由于天上的天使处于从主所领受的良善，所以他们只渴望履行功用或有用的服务。这些就是他们生命的真正快乐，他们在何等程度上履行功用或有用的服务，就在何等程度上享受幸福和快乐（参看<a href="453.htm">453</a>，<a href="454.htm">454</a>，<a href="696.htm">696</a>，<a href="997.htm">997</a>，<a href="3645.htm">3645</a>节）。这也是主在马太福音中的教导：<br />人子要在祂父的荣耀里，同着众使者来临。那时候，祂要照各人的行为报应各人。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.27.htm">16:27</a>）<br />“行为”（works，或译工作、职业等）在此不是指诸如外在形式上，而是诸如内在形式上的那类工作，也就是说，是包含在它们里面的那种仁爱；天使并不以其它任何方式来看待工作。<br />再者，由于人的行为是其仁与信的一切的结合体，而生活使得仁成为仁，信成为信，进而成为良善，故主爱约翰胜过祂其余的门徒，他在晚饭的时候靠着耶稣的胸膛（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约21.20.htm">21:20</a>）；因为这个门徒代表好行为或仁爱的行为（参看创世记18和22章序言）。由于同样的原因，主对约翰说“跟从我”，却没有对彼得这样说（注：在约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约21.22.htm">21:22</a>中，“跟从我”这句话显然是对彼得说的。译者不清楚瑞典伯格想要说什么），彼得代表信（参看创世记18和22章序言）。因此，信，即“彼得”，愤愤不平地说：<br />主啊，这人将来如何？耶稣对他说，我若要他等到我来的时候，与你何干？你跟从我吧。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约21.21.htm">21:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约21.23.htm">23</a>）<br />这也是一个预言，即：信会蔑视行为，即便主与行为联系在一起，这从主对绵羊和山羊所说的话（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.34.htm">25:34</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.46.htm">46</a>）可以清楚看出来，其中所列举的无非是行为。信会弃绝主，这一事实从彼得三次否认主（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.34.htm">26:34</a>）时的代表明显可知。他在夜里否认表示教会的末期，那时仁不复存在（参看<a href="6000.htm">6000</a>节）；他三次否认表示那时末期是完整的（<a href="1825.htm">1825</a>，<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="4495.htm">4495</a>，<a href="5159.htm">5159</a>节）；“鸡叫以先”表示在教会的新样或新阶段到来之前，因为黑夜过后的黎明和早晨表示教会的第一个阶段（<a href="2405.htm">2405</a>，<a href="5962.htm">5962</a>节）。</p>

What are your works? That this signifies about services and uses, is evident from the signification of "works," as being goods (n. 6048), thus services and uses, for these are goods. All the goods which 
are called goods of charity are nothing but uses, and uses are nothing but works for the neighbor, for our country, for the church, for the Lord's kingdom. Moreover regarded in itself charity itself 
does not become charity until it comes into act and becomes work. For to love anyone, and not do him good when we have the power, is not to love him; but to do him good when we have the power, and 
to do it from our hearts, this is to love him; and then all things of charity toward him are contained within the very deed or work; for a man's works are the complex of all things of his charity and 
faith, and are what are called spiritual goods, and indeed become goods by exercise, that is, by means of uses. [2] As the angels who are in heaven are in good from the Lord, they long for nothing more 
than to perform uses. These are the very delights of their life, and it is also according to uses that they enjoy bliss and happiness (see n. 453, 454, 696, 997, 3645), which likewise the Lord teaches 
in Matthew: </p>
<p>     The Son of man shall come in the glory of His Father with His angels; and then shall He render to everyone according to his works (Matt. 16:27); </p>
<p>by "works" here are not meant works 
such as they appear in the outward form, but such as they are in their inward form, namely, such as is the charity contained in them; the angels regard works in no other way. [3] And because a man's 
works are the complex of all things of his charity and faith, and the life causes charity to be charity and faith to be faith, thus good, therefore the Lord loved John more than the rest of His disciples, 
and he lay on His breast at supper (John 21:20); for by him were represented the goods or works of charity (see prefaces to Gen. 18 and 22); for which reason also the Lord said unto him, "Follow 
Me," and not to Peter, by whom was represented faith (see the same prefaces). Wherefore faith, which is "Peter," said with indignation, "Lord, what shall this man do? Jesus said unto him, If I will 
that he remain till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou Me" (John 21:21-23). By this was also foretold that faith would despise works, and yet that these are near the Lord, as may also be clearly 
seen from the Lord's words to the sheep and to the goats (Matt. 25:34-46), wherein nothing but works are recounted. And that faith would reject the Lord is evident from the representation by Peter 
when he denied Him thrice; that he did this at night, signifies the last time of the church, when there is no longer any charity (see n. 6000); that he did it thrice signifies that this condition is 
then complete (n. 1825, 2788, 4495, 5159); that it was before the cock crew, signifies before newness of the church would arise, for the twilight and morning which follow the night signify the first of 
the church (n. 2405, 5962). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6073</b></p><p><b>6073.</b>
'What are your works?' means regarding duties and services. This is clear from the meaning of 'works' as forms of good, dealt with in <a href="6048.htm">6048</a>, thus useful services and duties, for these are forms of good. 
Every good that is called a good of charity consists in nothing other than useful service, and useful services are nothing other than works done for one's neighbour, country, Church, and the Lord's 
kingdom. Regarded essentially charity does not actually become charity until it passes into action and becomes a work; for loving someone but not doing anything good for him when the possibility exists 
is not really loving him. Doing good for him when the possibility exists, and doing it with all one's heart, is loving him; for then the actual deed or work contains all that constitutes charity towards 
him. For works embrace every aspect of charity and faith present with a person and are called forms of spiritual good, made such through the exercise of charity, that is, through useful services. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
Because the angels in heaven are governed by good received from the Lord, they have no greater desire than to perform useful services. These are the very delights of their life, and in the measure 
that they perform useful services they enjoy blessing and happiness, <a href="453.htm">453</a>, <a href="696.htm">696</a>, <a href="997.htm">997</a>, <a href="3645.htm">3645</a>. This is also the Lord's teaching in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
The Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father together 
with His angels, and at that time He will repay everyone according to his works. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2016:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 16:17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Works' is not used here to mean works such as they are in outward appearance but such as they appear 
inwardly - that is to say, what kind of charity they hold within them. Angels do not look on works in any other way. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Furthermore, since works are a combination of every aspect of charity and 
faith present with a person, and since life causes charity to be charity and faith to be faith, and so to be good, John was loved more than the other disciples by the Lord and leaned on His breast at 
the Last Supper, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2021:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 21:20</a>. For that disciple represented the good deeds or works of charity, see the Prefaces to Genesis <a href="18.htm">18</a> and <a href="22.htm">22</a>. For the same reason the Lord said to him Follow Me; He did not say 
it to Peter,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> who represented faith, see those same Prefaces, and this led faith, which is Peter, to be indignant and say,  </p>
<blockquote>
Lord, but what about this man? Jesus said to Him, If I will that he remain 
until I come, what is that to you? You, follow Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2021:19,%2011-23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 21:19, 11-23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This was also a prediction that faith would come to despise works, even though the Lord associates Himself with them, as may 
also be seen quite clearly from the Lord's words addressed to the sheep and the goats at Matthew <a href="25.htm">25</a>, where nothing else than works are listed in verses 34-46. The fact that faith would disown the Lord 
is evident from the representation by Peter in his denial of Him three times, [<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2026:34&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 26:34</a>.] His denial 'at night' means the final period of the Church when no charity would exist any longer, <a href="6000.htm">6000</a>; 
his denial 'three times' means that at that point the final period would be complete, <a href="1825.htm">1825</a>, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="4495.htm">4495</a>, <a href="5159.htm">5159</a>; and 'before the cock crowed' means before a new phase of the Church had arrived, for twilight 
and morning which follow night mean the first phase of a Church, <a href="2405.htm">2405</a>, <a href="5962.htm">5962</a>.

`Quid opera vestra ?':  quod significet de officiis et usibus, constat ex significatione `operum' quod sint bona, de qua n. 6048, ita usus et officia, nam haec sunt bona; omnia bona quae bona charitatis 
vocantur, non sunt nisi quam usus, et usus non sunt nisi quam opera erga proximum, erga patriam, erga Ecclesiam, erga regnum Domini; ipsa etiam charitas in se spectata non fit charitas priusquam 
illa in actum venit et fit opus; amare enim aliquem et non facere ei bonum cum potest, est non amare; ast facere ei bonum cum potest, et hoc ex corde, est amare illum; et tunc intus in ipso facto seu 
opere continentur omnia charitatis erga illum; sunt enim opera complexus omnium charitatis et {1}fidei apud hominem, et sunt quae vocantur bona spiritualia, et fiunt etiam bona per exercitia, hoc est, 
per usus.  [2]Angeli qui in caelo, quia in bono sunt ex Domino, nihil plus desiderant quam praestare usus; hi sunt ipsa jucunda vitae eorum, et quoque secundum usus beatitudine et felicitate fruuntur, 
n. 453, 696, 997, 3645; quod etiam Dominus docet apud Matthaeum, 	Venturus est Filius hominis in gloria Patris Sui, cum angelis  Suis, et tunc {2}reddet unicuique secundum opera ejus, xvi 27;  per 
`opera' hic non intelliguntur opera qualia apparent in forma externa sed qualia in forma interna, nempe quale charitatis in se habent; [3]angeli non vident aliter opera; et quia opera sunt complexus 
omnium charitatis et fidei apud hominem, ac vita facit ut charitas sit charitas et fides sit fides, ita bonum, ideo Dominus prae reliquis discipulis amavit Johannem, et is {3}accubuit in Cena super pectore 
Ipsius, Joh. xxi 20, nam per illum repraesentabantur charitatis bona seu opera, videantur Praefationes ad Gen. xviii et xxii; ideo quoque Dominus ad illum dixit, Sequere Me, non ad Petrum per quem 
repraesentabatur fides, videantur eaedem Praefationes; quare fides quae est `Petrus', indignata dixit, 	Domine, hic vero quid? dixit illi Jesus, Si illum volo manere donec venio, quid ad te? tu sequere 
me, joh. xxi 19, 21-23;  per quae etiam praedictum quod fides contemneret opera, et usque quod illa sint apud Dominum; ut quoque manifeste constare potest a Domini verbis ad oves et ad hircos, 
Matth. xxv ubi non nisi quam opera recensentur, vers. 34-46.  Quod autem fides rejiceret Dominum, patet a repraesentatione per `Petrum' quod ter Ipsum abnegaverit; quod `nocte' id fecerit, significat 
ultimum tempus Ecclesiae cum amplius nulla charitas, n. 6000; `quod ter hoc fecerit' significat quod tunc completum, n. 1825, 2788, 4495, 5159; `quod antequam gallus caneret' significat antequam novum 
Ecclesiae existeret, nam diluculum et mane quae noctem sequuntur, significant primum Ecclesiae, n. 2405, 5962. @1 fides I$  @2 reddit I$ @3 occubuit I$ </p>
