<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4792节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4792.</strong>由于食物和营养对应于属灵的食物和营养，所以味觉对应于对这种食物的觉知和情感。属灵食物是知识、聪明和智慧。灵人和天使便靠这些存活，并得到营养；他们渴望和欲求它们，就像饥肠辘辘的人渴望和欲求食物一样。因此，食欲对应于对它们的这种渴望。说来奇妙，灵人和天使也靠这种属灵食物逐渐成熟；因为那些死去的小孩子在来世看上去就像小孩子，并且就其理解力而言，也是小孩子。不过，随着在聪明和智慧上的逐渐成长，他们不再看似小孩子，而是看似那些即将成年的人，最后看似成年人。我与一些死于婴孩时期的人交谈过，他们在我看来就像年轻人，因为这时他们在理解力上已经成长了。由此可见何为属灵的食物和营养。</p>

As food and nourishment correspond to spiritual food and nourishment, therefore taste corresponds to the perception and affection of this food. Spiritual food is knowledge, intelligence, and wisdom, 
for from these, spirits and angels live and are nourished, and they desire and have appetite for them just as men who are hungry desire and have appetite for food. Hence appetite corresponds to this desire. 
And wonderful to say, from this food they grow to maturity; for little children who die appear in the other life no otherwise than as little children, and also are such as to understanding; but 
as they increase in intelligence and wisdom, they appear not as little children, but as advancing in age, and at last as adults. I have conversed with some who had died in infancy, and were seen by me 
as young men, because they were then intelligent. From this it is evident what spiritual food and nourishment are. </p>

Because food and nourishment correspond to spiritual food and nourishment, taste consequently corresponds to a perception of and an affection for this food. Spiritual food consists in knowledge, intelligence, 
and wisdom. These are what quicken and also sustain spirits and angels, who desire them and have an appetite for them as men desire and have an appetite for food when they are very hungry. Therefore 
appetite corresponds to that desire for them. And what is amazing, spirits and angels also grow to maturity on that spiritual food, for those who die as young children do not in the next life 
look like any but young children, and they are young children too as far as their understanding goes. But as they grow in intelligence and wisdom they cease to look like young children. They now look 
like those who are coming of age, and at length like adults. I have talked to some who died when they were young children and who looked to me like youths, for by then they had grown in understanding. 
From this one may see what spiritual food and nourishment are. </p>

</p><b>4792.</b>
Quia cibus et nutritio correspondet cibo et nutritioni spirituali inde gustus correspondet perceptioni et affectioni ejus; </p>
<p>cibus spiritualis es scientia, intelligentia et sapientia; ex his enim vivunt 
et ex his quoque nutriuntur spiritus et angeli, et desiderant et appetunt illa, sicut homines qui famelici cibum; inde appetitus correspondet illi desiderio.  Et quod mirum, ex illo cibo etiam 
adolescunt; infantes enim qui decedunt, in altera vita non aliter quam infantes apparent, et sunt quoque infantes quoad intellectum; sed sicut intelligentia (c)ac sapientia crescunt, ita apparent 
non ut infantes sed sicut provecti aetate, et tandem sicut adulti; locutus sum cum quibusdam qui infante mortui sunt, qui sicut juvenes mihi visi, quia tunc intelligentes.  Inde patet quid cibus et 
nutritio spiritualis. </p>
