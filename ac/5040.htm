Verses 21-23. And Jehovah was with Joseph, and inclined mercy unto him, and gave him grace in the eyes of the prince of the prison house. And the prince of the prison house gave into Joseph's hand all 
the bound ones that were in the prison house; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer. The prince of the prison house saw naught of anything that was in his hand, because Jehovah was with him; 
and that which he did, Jehovah made it to prosper. "And Jehovah was with Joseph," signifies that the Divine was in Him; "and inclined mercy unto him," signifies the Divine love in everything; "and gave 
him grace in the eyes of the prince of the prison house," signifies relief in consequence; "and the prince of the prison house," signifies truth governing in a state of temptations; "gave into Joseph's 
hand all the bound ones that were in the prison house," signifies from Himself over all falsities; "and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer," signifies absolute power; "the prince of the 
prison house saw naught of anything that was in his hand," signifies that He Himself governed truth; "because Jehovah was with him," signifies from the Divine which was in Him; "and that which he did, 
Jehovah made it to prosper," signifies that the Divine providence was from Himself. </p>

Verses 21-23 And Jehovah was with Joseph, and showed mercy to him, and gave him favour in the eyes of the governor<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the prison-house. And the governor<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the prison-house gave into Joseph's hand 
all the bound who were in the prison-house; and everything they did there, he was the doer of it.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> The governor of the prison-house oversaw nothing whatever that was in his hand, in that Jehovah was 
with him; and whatever he did, Jehovah made it prosper.  </p>
<p>'And Jehovah was with Joseph' means that the Divine was inwardly present. 'And showed mercy to him' means Divine love within every individual 
thing. 'And gave him favour in the eyes of the governor of the prison-house' means consequent support in temptations. 'And the governor of the prison-house gave' means the truth governing in a state 
of temptations. 'Into Joseph's hand all the bound who were in the prison-house' means from Him over all falsities. 'And everything they did there, he was the doer of it' means absolute power and control. 
'The governor of the prison-house oversaw nothing whatever that was in his hand' means that He Himself governed truth. 'In that Jehovah was with him' means from the Divine that was within Him. 'And 
whatever he did, Jehovah made it prosper' means that the Divine Providence began in Himself.

Vers. 21-23.  Et fuit Jehovah cum Josepho, et inclinavit ad eum misericordiam, et dedit gratiam ejus in oculis principis domus carceris. Et dedit princeps domus carceris in manum Josephi omnes vinctos 
qui in domo carceris, et omne quod facientes ibi, is fuit faciens.  Nihil princeps domus carceris videns quicquam in manu ejus, eo quod Jehovah cum eo, et quod is faciens, Jehovah prosperans. 
 `Et fuit Jehovah cum Josepho' significat quod Divinum inesset: `et inclinavit ad eum misericordiam' significat amorem Divinum in singulis: `et dedit gratiam ejus in oculis principis domus carceris' 
significat inde sublevationem in tentationibus: `et dedit princeps domus carceris' significat verum gubernans in statu tentationum: `in manum Josephi omnes vinctos qui in domo carceris' significat 
ab Ipso super omnia falsa: `et omne quod facientes ibi, is fuit faciens' significat absolutam potestatem: `nihil princeps domus carceris videns quicquam in manu ejus' significat quod Ipse gubernaret 
verum: [`eo quod Jehovah cum eo' significat a Divino quod in Ipso:] `et quod is faciens, Jehovah prosperans' significat quod Divina Providentia ab Ipso. </p>
