<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8318节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8318.</strong>“惊骇恐惧临到他们”表他们毫无统治的任何希望。这从“惊骇恐惧”的含义清楚可知，当论及那些陷入自我之爱，并因此陷入虚假和邪恶的人，也就是“以东的族长”和“摩押的强者”所表示的那些人时，“惊骇恐惧”是指他们毫无统治的希望。因为那些陷入自我之爱的邪恶之人不断渴望统治，但当由获胜的敌人所造成的恐惧临到他们身上时，他们统治的希望就破灭了。<br />要知道，邪恶是由双重源头产生的，即自我之爱和尘世之爱，或爱自己和爱世界。陷入起因于自我之爱的邪恶之人只爱自己，蔑视其他所有人，除了那些与他们自己合而为一的人之外。他们若爱这些人，也并非真的爱他们，而是爱自己，因为他们在这些人里面看见自己。由这个源头所产生的邪恶是最坏的；因为陷入这种邪恶的人与自己相比，不仅蔑视其他所有人，还辱骂他们，因为一点点原因就憎恨他们，渴望他们毁灭。报复和残忍以这种方式成为他们生活的乐趣。那些陷入自我之爱的邪恶之人照这爱的质和量而在地狱的深处。<br />至于那些陷入由尘世之爱所产生的邪恶之人，他们也将邻舍看得一文不值，看重他只是因为他的财富，因而看重的是他的财富，而不是这个人自己。这些人渴望占有属于其邻舍的一切，当这种渴望主宰他们时，他们就缺乏一切仁爱和怜悯。抢夺邻舍的财物是他们生活的乐趣，尤其是那些贪得无厌的人，也就是那些为了金银而非来自金银的任何功用而爱金银之人的乐趣。那些被这爱的邪恶统治的人也在地狱，不过他们所在的地狱不如那些陷入自我之爱的邪恶之人的地狱那么深。除这两种邪恶的源头外，还有第三种源头，该源头就是出于虚假的宗教信仰而行恶。不过，当这种邪恶存在于那些陷入自我之爱和尘世之爱的人身上时，它就算为邪恶；但当它存在于那些处于对邻之爱和对他们的神之爱的人身上时，不算为邪恶，因为他们所关注的目的是良善，目的决定了其它一切的性质（参看<a href="8311.htm">8311</a>节）。</p>

Fright and dread have fallen upon them. That this signifies that they are without any hope of domination, is evident from the signification of "fright and dread," when said of those who are in the love 
of self and in the consequent falsities and evils, who are signified by "the chiefs of Edom and the mighty ones of Moab," as being that they are without hope of domination; for they who are in the 
evil of the love of self continually desire to domineer, but when terror falls upon them on account of a victorious enemy, then the hope of domineering falls. [2] Be it known that evils are from a double 
origin; namely, from the love of self, and from the love of the world. They who are in evils from the love of self, love themselves only, and despise all others except those who make one with themselves, 
in loving whom they do not love them, but themselves, because they see themselves in them. The evils from this origin are the worst of all; for they who are in them not only despise all others 
in comparison with themselves, but also pursue them with invectives, and bear hatred toward them for slight cause, and then breathe their destruction. In this way revenge and cruelty become the delight 
of their life. They who are in the evil of this love are at a depth in hell according to the quality and amount of this love. [3] But they who are in evil from the love of the world also hold their 
neighbor in slight estimation, and esteem him solely by reason of his wealth; thus they esteem his riches, not him. These desire to possess all that belongs to their neighbor, and when they are in 
this cupidity, they are then devoid of all charity and mercy; for to deprive their neighbor of his goods is the delight of their life, especially of those who are sordidly avaricious, that is, who love 
gold and silver for the sake of gold and silver, but not for the sake of any use from them. Those with whom the evil of this love has dominion are also in the hells, but not in hells so deep as are 
they who are in the evil of the love of self. Besides these two origins of evil there is also a third, which is to do evil from the principles of a false religion; but this evil has a bad character with 
those who are in the love of self and of the world; but not with those who are in love toward the neighbor and to their God; for the end is good, and the end qualifies all the rest (see n. 8311). </p>

'Alarm and dread fell on them' means that they were without any hope of dominion. This is clear from the meaning of 'alarm and dread' - when the phrase applies to those ruled by self-love and therefore 
by falsities and evils, who are meant by 'the chiefs of Edom' and 'the powerful ones of Moab' - as being without any hope of dominion. Those ruled by the evil of self-love have a constant desire to 
dominate, but when terror caused by a triumphant enemy strikes them the hope of being able to dominate forsakes them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It should be recognized that evils arise from a dual origin - self-love and 
love of the world. People ruled by evils arising from self-love love only themselves and despise everyone else except those who make common cause with them. And if they love these they do not really 
love them, only themselves, because they see themselves in them. Evils arising from this origin are the worst of all; for those people not only despise all others in contrast to themselves but also heap 
insults on them, hate them for the slightest reason, and long for their destruction. Vengeance and cruelty accordingly become the delight of their life. People ruled by the evil of self-love are in 
hell at a great depth determined by the nature and amount of that love. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 As for those ruled by evil arising from love of the world, they too regard the neighbour as being worthless. They value 
him only for his wealth, and so value his wealth but not the person himself. They have the desire to own everything belonging to their neighbour; and when this desire rules them they are devoid of any 
charity or pity. Robbing their neighbour of his goods is the delight of their life, especially of those who are disgustingly avaricious, that is to say, of those who love gold and silver for their own 
sakes, not for the sake of any useful purpose served by them. Those with whom the evil of this love reigns are also in hells, but in ones not so deep as the hells which those ruled by the evil of self-love 
are in. In addition to these two origins of evil there is also a third, which consists in doing evil as a result of false religious principles. But this kind of evil is calculated as evil when 
it exists with those ruled by self-love and love of the world, but not when it exists with those governed by love towards the neighbour and to their God, since good is their end in view and the end 
determines the nature of all else, see <a href="8311.htm">8311</a>. </p>

`Cecidit super illos formido et pavor': quod significet quod absque ulla spe dominationis, constat ex significatione `formidinis et pavoris,' cum dicitur de illis qui in amore sui et inde falsis et 
malis, qui significantur per `duces Edomi et potentes Moabi,' quod sit quod absque spe dominationis; qui enim in malo amoris sui sunt continue cupiunt dominari, at cum cadit super illos terror pro hoste 
victore, tunc cadit spes dominandi. 	2 Sciendum quod mala {1}sint ex duplici origine, nempe ex amore sui et ex amore mundi; qui in malis ex amore sui sunt, illi se {2}solos amant et omnes reliquos 
contemnunt praeter illos qui unum faciunt {3}cum ipsis, quos cum amant, non illos amant sed se, quia vident se in illis; mala ex hac origine sunt omnium pessima, nam non {4}solum omnes alios prae se 
contemnunt sed etiam vituperiis prosequuntur, et ex {5}levi causa odio habent, et tunc perniciem illorum spirant; fitque sic vindicta et {6} crudelitas jucundum vitae (c)illorum; qui in malo illius amoris 
sunt, in inferno sunt profunde secundum amoris illius quale et quantum. 	3 Qui autem in malo ex amore mundi sunt, illi etiam proximum nauci habent et illum aestimant solum ex opulentia, ita opes 
non autem ipsum; illi cupiunt omnia possidere quae proximi sunt; {7}cum in hac cupiditate sunt, {8}tunc absque omni charitate et misericordia sunt; privare enim proximum suis bonis est jucundum vitae 
illorum, imprimis illorum qui sordide avari sunt, qui nempe amant aurum et argentum propter aurum et argentum, non autem propter aliquem usum ex illis; illi apud (x)quos malum {9}hujus amoris dominatur 
etiam in infernis sunt, sed non in tam profundis ut illi qui in malo amoris sui (d)sunt.  Praeter binas has origines mali etiam datur {10}tertia, quae est malum facere ex principiis {11}falsae religionis; 
{12} sed hoc malum audit malum apud illos qui in amore sui et mundi sunt, non autem apud illos qui in amore erga proximum et in Deum suum sunt; nam finis est bonum, et finis qualificat reliqua,
