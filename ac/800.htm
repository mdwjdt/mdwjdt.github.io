<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第800节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>800.</strong>“凡爬在地上的血肉都断了气”表那些属于上古教会最后一代的人都被毁灭了。这一点从下文清楚可知，那里描述了他们的信念和欲望。此处，他们首先被称为“爬在地上的血肉”，因为他们彻底变得感官和肉体化。如前所述，上古之人将感官和肉体之物比作“爬行物”。所以，当经上提及“爬在地上的血肉”时，其实是指彻底变得感官和肉体化的那类人。如前所述，“血肉”总体上表整个人类，具体表肉体人。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]800.</strong> The meaning of all flesh creeping on the earth passed away as the fact that those who belonged to the final generation of the earliest church died out can be seen from later sections that describe their delusions and desires [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_800/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_803" target=_top>803</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_800/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_806" target=_top>806</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_800/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_808" target=_top>808</a>].<br />Here for the first time they are called flesh creeping on the earth, because they became obsessed with sensory and bodily matters. The earliest people compared sense impressions and bodily concerns to creeping animals, as noted earlier [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_800/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_195" target=_top>195-197</a>], so that when the text mentions flesh creeping on the earth, it symbolizes the kind of people who have become entirely absorbed in what is sensory and bodily.<br />Previous statements and evidence [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_800/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_574" target=_top>574</a>] have shown that flesh symbolizes everyone, when used in a broad sense, and body-centered people, when used in a narrow sense. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 800</b></p><p><b>800.</b>
And all flesh died that creepeth upon the earth. That this signifies that they who were of the last posterity of the Most Ancient Church became extinct, is evident from what follows, where they are described 
as to their persuasions and their cupidities. They are here first called "flesh that creepeth upon the earth" for the reason that they had become altogether sensuous and corporeal. Sensuous and 
corporeal things, as has been said, were likened by the most ancient men to creeping things; and therefore when "flesh moving upon the earth" is spoken of, such a man is signified as has become merely 
sensuous and corporeal. That "flesh" signifies all mankind in general, and specifically the corporeal man, has been said and shown before. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 800</b></p><p><b>800.</b>
'All flesh that creeps over the earth breathed its last' means that those who belonged to the final descendants of the Most Ancient Church were annihilated. This is clear from what follows, where they 
are described in respect to their persuasions and their desires. Here they are first of all called 'flesh that creeps over the earth', for the reason that they were become utterly sensory-minded and 
bodily-minded. As already stated, sensory and bodily things were likened by the most ancient people to 'creeping things'. Consequently when the phrase 'flesh that creeps over the earth' is used, the 
kind of person who has become wholly sensory-minded and bodily-minded is meant. That 'flesh' means all mankind in general and a bodily-minded person in particular has been stated and shown already. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 800</b>
</p><b>800.</b>
Quod 'exspiravit omnis caro repens super terra' significet quod exstincti qui ab ultima posteritate Antiquissimae Ecclesiae, constat a sequentibus, ubi describuntur quoad persuasiones et quoad cupiditates: 
hic primum vocantur 'caro repens super terra,' ex causa quia prorsus sensuales et corporei facti sunt; sensualia et corporea ab antiquissimis assimilata sunt 'reptilibus,' ut prius dictum; quare 
cum dicitur 'caro repens super terra,' significatur talis homo qui mere sensualis et corporeus factus: quod 'caro' significet omnem hominem in genere, et corporeum in specie, prius dictum et ostensum est. </p>
