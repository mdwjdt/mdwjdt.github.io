<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2141节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2141.</strong>主的直觉是这样：人类沉浸在恶与假中，因为“所多玛”是指自我之爱，以及由此衍生的出于邪恶实施操控的欲望，“蛾摩拉”则指出于虚假这样做（16，20节）。这一切瞒不过在此状态下的主，因为一切救赎都要凭借祂，并来自祂（17-19节）；也就是说，其邪恶达到顶点时，他们就会遭到刑罚（20，21节）。当处在这种直觉状态时（22节），主为他们祈求：首先为那些将具有真理，并且这些真理充满良善的人祈求，他们用“五十”来表示（23-26节）；之后为那些将具有次等的良善，但这良善仍与真理结合的人祈求，他们用“四十五”来表示（27，28节）；接下来为那些经历试探的人祈求，他们用“四十”来表示（29节）；同样为那些与邪恶争战的人祈求，他们用“三十”来表示（30节）；再接下来为那些将通过其它源头具有对良善的情感状态之人祈求，他们用“二十”来表示（31节）；最后为那些将具有对真理的情感状态之人祈求，他们用“十”来表示（32节）；每一次的答复都是，他们必得救（26，28-32节）。这些事成就之后，主恢复到之前直觉的状态（33节）。这些就是本章内义所包含的奥秘，这些奥秘并未从字面显现出来。</p>

The Lord's perception concerning the human race, that it was in evil and falsity, "Sodom" being the love of self and the derivative cupidity of exercising command from what is evil, and "Gomorrah" being 
the same from what is false (verses 16, 20). That this could not be concealed from the Lord in that state, because by Him and from Him is all salvation (verses 17-19); that is to say, they were to 
be visited when their wickedness reached its height (verses 20-21). That when He was in this perception (verse 22), He interceded for them; first for those with whom there should be truths, and these 
truths full of goods, who are signified by the "fifty" (verses 23-26); also for those with whom there should be less of good, but this good nevertheless conjoined with truths, who are signified by the 
"forty-five" (verses 27-28); next for those who have been in temptations, who are signified by the "forty" (verse 29); as likewise for those who have been in some combats against evils, who are signified 
by the "thirty" (verse 30); afterwards for those with whom there should be states of the affection of good from any other source, who are signified by the "twenty" (verse 31); lastly for those with 
whom there should be states of the affection of truth, who are signified by the "ten" (verse 32); and the constant answer was that they should be saved (verses 26, 28-32). These things being accomplished, 
the Lord returned into His former state of perception (verse 33). These are the arcana contained in the internal sense of this chapter, which are not manifest from the letter. </p>

The Lord's perception was this, that the human race was immersed in evil and falsity, Sodom being self-love and the consequent desire to exercise control from evil, Gomorrah to do so from falsity, verses 16, 20. This could not be concealed from the Lord in that state because He is the means and He is the source of all salvation, verses 17-19; that is to say, they would be visited when their wickedness 
had reached its peak, verses 20, 21. While that perception existed with Him, verse 22, He interceded on their behalf - first on behalf of those with whom truths were both present and filled with 
goods, who are meant by 'the fifty', verses 23-26; then on behalf of those with whom less good was present but was nevertheless joined to truths, who are meant by 'the forty-five', verses 27, 28; after 
that on behalf of those who were undergoing temptations, who are meant by 'the forty', verse 29; and also on behalf of those who have been involved in some conflicts with evils, who are meant by 'the 
thirty', verse 30; following these on behalf of those with whom states existed of affection for good, which were from some other source, who are meant by 'the twenty', verse 31; and finally on behalf 
of those with whom states of affection for truth existed, who are meant by 'the ten', verse 32. And each time the reply came back that they were to be saved, verses 26, 28-32. When all this was completed 
the Lord returned to His previous state of perception, verse 33. These are the arcana in this chapter in the internal sense, which are not evident from the letter. </p>

</p><b>2141.</b>
Perceptio Domini de humano genere quod in malo et {1} falso; `Sodoma' est amor sui et inde cupiditas imperandi ex malo, `Amora' est ex falso, vers. 16, 20: quod non celari potuerit Domino in illo statu, 
quia per Ipsam et ab Ipso omnis salvatio, vers. 17-19 nempe quod visitandi, quando ad summum malitia eorum pervenit, vers. 20, 21 cum in perceptione illa esset, vers. 22 quod intercesserit pro illis; 
primam pro illis apud quos vera, et ea plena bonis, qui significantur per `quinquaginta,' vers. 23-26: tam pro illis apud quos minus boni, sed hoc usque conjunctum veris, qui significantur per `quadraginta 
quinque,' vers. 27, 28: dein pro illis qui in tentationibus fuerunt, qui significantur per `quadraginta,' vers. 29: ut et pro illis qui in aliquibus pugnis contra mala [fuerunt], qui significantur 
per `triginta,' vers. 30: post pro illis apud quos aliunde status affectionis boni, qui significantur per `viginti,' vers. 31: demum pro illis apud quos status affectionis veri, qui significantur 
per `decem,' vers. 32: et jugiter responsum, quod illi salvarentur, vers. 26, 28-32: his peractis, quod Dominus in pristinum statum perceptionis redierit, vers. 33.  Haec arcana in hoc capite sunt 
in sensu interno, quae ex littera non patent {2}. 	@1 i in.$ 	@2 In A there are interesting notes on these last verses, as follows: </p>
<p>                Sodoma              Amora      Amor imperandi ex 
malo et amor imperandi ex falso. 	50            45              40           30 Si multum boni, adjunctum, per tentationes aut pugnas, aut alios             20              10 status affectionis 
boni aut affectionis veri.  They are followed by a shorter and much corrected form of n. 2136-2141.$ </p>
