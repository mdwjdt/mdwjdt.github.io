<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4116.</strong>“过大河”表有结合在其中的状态。这从“河”的含义清楚可知，“河”，就是此处的幼发拉底河，是指结合，即与神性的结合。“河”在此之所以具有这样的含义，是因为它是将迦南地和那个地区分开的边界；迦南地的所有边界都代表、因而表示末后的和首先的；代表并表示末后的，是因为那里是它终结所在之地；代表并表示首先的，是因为那里是它开始所在之地。因为所有边界都具有这样的性质：对于那些正要从这地出去的人来说，它们是末后的；但对于那些正要进来的人来说，它们却是首先的。由于雅各现在要进入，所以这条河就成了他所穿过的第一个边界，因而表示结合，在至高意义上表示与神性的结合；因为“迦南地”在内在意义上表示主的属天国度（<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="3481.htm">3481</a>节）；在至高意义上表示主的神性人身（<a href="3038.htm">3038</a>，<a href="3705.htm">3705</a>节）。由此明显可知，雅各“过大河”在此表示什么。因为迦南地境内的一切事物都是代表，它们的具体代表取决于距离、位置和边界（参看<a href="1585.htm">1585</a>，<a href="3686.htm">3686</a>节）；因而作为边界的河，如埃及的河，幼发拉底河和约旦河，都是代表（<a href="1866.htm">1866</a>节）。</p>

And he passed over the river. That this signifies a state wherein is conjunction, is evident from the signification of the "river," here the Euphrates, as being conjunction, namely, with the Divine. 
The "river" has this signification here, because it was the boundary of the land of Canaan on that side; and all the boundaries of the land of Canaan represented and thence signified what was last and 
what was first; what was last because there there was an ending, and what was first because there there was a beginning; for all boundaries are of such a nature as to be last to those who are going out, 
and first to those who are entering in. As Jacob was now entering in, that river was his first boundary, and consequently denotes conjunction, namely, in the supreme sense, with the Divine; for by 
the land of Canaan in the internal sense there is signified the Lord's celestial kingdom (n. 1607, 3481); and in the supreme sense the Lord's Divine Human (n. 3038, 3705). From this it is evident what 
is here signified by Jacob's passing over the river. (That all things in the land of Canaan were representative in accordance with their distances, situations, and boundaries, may be seen above, n. 
1585, 3686; and that so were the rivers which bounded it, as the river of Egypt, the Euphrates, and the Jordan, n. 1866.) </p>

'And crossed the river' means a state in which a joining together takes place. This is clear from the meaning of 'the river', which in this case is the Euphrates, as a joining together, namely a joining 
to the Divine. The reason 'the river' has this meaning here is that it was the boundary separating the land of Canaan from that region, and all the boundaries of the land of Canaan were representative 
of and consequently meant spiritually that which came last and yet first - last because that was where it came to an end, and first because it was where it began. For all boundaries are such that 
they come last for those who are going out of the country but first for those who are coming in. Because Jacob was at that point coming in, that river was the first boundary that he crossed, and so means 
a joining together - in the highest sense a joining to the Divine; for 'the land of Canaan' in the internal sense means the Lord's heavenly kingdom, <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>, <a href="3481.htm">3481</a>, and in the highest sense the Lord's 
Divine Human, <a href="3038.htm">3038</a>, <a href="3705.htm">3705</a>. From all this one may see what is meant here by 'he crossed the river'. For all things in the land of Canaan were representative, with distances, positions, and boundaries 
determining their individual representations, see <a href="1585.htm">1585</a>, <a href="3686.htm">3686</a>; thus the rivers which served as boundaries, such as the river of Egypt, the river Euphrates, and the river Jordan, were representative, <a href="1866.htm">1866</a>. </p>

`Et transivit fluvium': quod significet statum ubI conjunctio, constat a significatione `fluvii,' hic Euphratis, quod sit conjunctio, nempe cum Divino; quod fluvius id hic significet, est causa quia 
erat terminus terrae Canaanis ab illa parte, et omnes termini terrae Canaanis repraesentabant et inde significabant id quod ultimum et quod primum esset, {1} ultimum quia ibi desinebat {2}, et 
primum quia ibi incohabat {3}; termini enim omnes tales sunt, quod sint ultimi illis qui exeunt, et iidem primi illis qui intrant; quia Jacob nunc intrabat, erat fluvius ille terminus primus, proinde 
conjunctio, nempe in sensu supremo cum Divino; per terram enim Canaanem (o)significatur in sensu interno regnum caeleste Domini, n. 1607, 3481; et in sensu supremo {4} Divinum Humanum Domini, {5} 
n. 3038, 3705; inde patet quid hic per `transivit fluvium' significatur.  Quod omnia in terra Canaane repraesentativa fuerint secundum distantias, situs, et terminos, videatur n. 1585, 3686; ita 
quod fluvii qui terminabant, ut fluvius Aegypti, {6} Euphrates, et Jordanes, n. 1866.      @1 i nempe illorum quae sunt Regni Domini per terram enim Canaanem repraesentabatur Regnum caeleste Domini
