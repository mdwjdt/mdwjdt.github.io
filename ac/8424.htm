Verses 6-8. And Moses and Aaron said unto all the sons of Israel, In the evening, then ye shall know that Jehovah hath brought you out from the land of Egypt. And in the morning, then ye shall see the 
glory of Jehovah, in that He heareth your murmurings against Jehovah; and what are we, that ye murmur against us? And Moses said, In that Jehovah shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the 
morning bread to satiety; in that Jehovah heareth your murmurings with which ye murmur against Him: what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against Jehovah. "And Moses and Aaron said unto 
all the sons of Israel," signifies information from truth Divine; "In the evening, then ye shall know that Jehovah hath brought you out from the land of Egypt," signifies that in the end of the former 
state there shall be a revelation that they are liberated; "and in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of Jehovah," signifies that in the beginning of a new state there will be the advent of 
the Lord; "in that He heareth your murmurings," signifies that complaints will cease; "against Jehovah, and what are we, that ye murmur against us?" signifies that the complaints were against the Divine, 
and not against those who represented it; "and Moses said," signifies information; "In that Jehovah shall give you in the evening flesh to eat," signifies that in the end of the state good will be 
appropriated by means of delight; "and in the morning bread to satiety," signifies that in the beginning of a new state they shall have as much good as they can receive; "In that Jehovah heareth your 
murmurings," signifies that thus complaints will cease; "with which ye murmur against Him," signifies that these were against the Divine; "what are we? your murmurings are not against us," signifies 
that they were not against those who represented the Divine; "but against Jehovah," signifies that hereafter they must beware. </p>

Verses 6-8 And Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, At evening you will know that Jehovah has brought you out of the land of Egypt. And in the morning you will see the glory of Jehovah; 
He hears your grumblings against Jehovah, and what are we, that you grumble against us? And Moses said, Jehovah is giving you flesh to eat in the evening, and in the morning bread to the full; Jehovah 
hears your grumblings which you make against Him. What are we? Your grumblings are not against us, but against Jehovah. </p>
<p>'And Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel' means instructions 
given by God's truth. 'At evening you will know that Jehovah has brought you out of the land of Egypt' means that at the end of a former state comes the revelation that they have been delivered. 'And 
in the morning you will see the glory of Jehovah' means that at the beginning of a new state the arrival of the Lord is going to take place. 'He hears your grumblings' means that there will be an end 
to complaints. 'Against Jehovah, and what are we, that you grumble against us?' means that they were made against the Divine, not against those who represented Him. 'And Moses said' means instructions. 
'Jehovah is giving you flesh to eat in the evening' means that at the end of a state good will become their own through delight. 'And in the morning bread to the full' means that at the beginning 
of a new state they will have as much good as they can receive. 'Jehovah hears your grumblings' means that thus there will be an end to complaints. 'Which you make against Him' means that they were against 
the Divine. 'What are we? Your grumblings are not against us' means that they were not against those who represented the Divine. 'But against Jehovah' means that from now on they should watch themselves. </p>

Vers. (x)6-8.  Et dixit Moscheh et Aharon ad omnes filios Israelis, Vesperi et cognoscetis quod Jehovah eduxerit vos e terra Aegypti.  Et mane et videbitis gloriam Jehovae, in audire Ipsum murmurationes 
vestras contra Jehovam; et nos quid quod murmuretis contra nos?  Et dixit Moscheh, In dare Jehovam vobis in vespera carnem ad edendum, et panem in matuta ad satiandum; in audire Jehovam murmurationes 
vestras, quibus vos murmurantes contra Ipsum; nos quid? non contra nos murmurationes vestrae, quod contra Jehovam.  `Et dixit Moscheh et Aharon ad omnes filios Israelis' significat informationem 
a vero Divino: `Vesperi et cognoscetis quod Jehovah eduxerit vos e terra Aegypti' significat quod in fine prioris status revelatio quod liberati: `et mane videbitis gloriam Jehovae' significat in principio 
status novi quod Adventus Domini: `in audire Ipsum murmurationes vestras' significat quod cessaturae querimoniae: `contra Jehovam, et nos quid quod murmuretis contra nos?' significat quod illae 
fuerint contra Divinum, non contra illos qui Id repraesentabant: `et dixit Moscheh' significat informationem: `In dare Jehovam vobis in vespera carnem ad edendum' (x)significat quod in fine status bonum 
appropriabitur per jucundum: `et panem in matuta ad satiandum' significat quod in principio status novi habebitur bonum quantum recipere possunt: `in audire Jehovam murmurationes vestras' significat 
quod sic cessaturae querimoniae: `quibus vos murmurantes contra Ipsum' significat quod illae fuerint contra Divinum: `nos quid? non contra nos murmurationes vestrae' significat quod non contra illos 
qui repraesentabant Divinum: `quod contra Jehovam' significat ut sibi posthac caveant. </p>
