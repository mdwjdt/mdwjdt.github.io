<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第969节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>969.</strong>在如此巨大的王国中，自创世以来的所有人类灵魂都聚集在一起，每周仅来自地球的，就几乎接近一百万；而且，没有哪两个人的性情和秉性是相同的；在这里，每个人的一切思想观念都被交流；尽管如此，一切事物，无论总体还是细节，都必须恢复秩序，并且这一过程会持续进行；从未进入人脑海的无数事物都会在此显明自己，这是必然的。由于人们对地狱就象对天堂一样，连一个模糊的概念都没有，所以这些事物必令他们感到震惊和奇妙，尤其他们以为精灵没有任何感官知觉，殊不知，精灵的感官知觉远比人类的敏锐得多。另外，恶灵会利用世上闻所未闻的手段在他们身上引发知觉，几乎和肉体的一样，只是肉体的知觉相对迟钝得多。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]969.</strong> The spiritual realm is the gathering place for the souls of all people from the beginning of creation, of which almost a million a week come from our planet. They all have their own bent of mind and their own personality, different from that of others. Everybody's ideas are all communicated to others, and yet all things as a whole and in particular must continually be brought into order.<br />A realm of this size, of course, contains countless phenomena that people on earth have never even imagined. Hardly any of them have formed more than a single vague idea of hell, any more than they have of heaven. As a result, these facts cannot help striking them as strange and astounding. This is chiefly due to the belief that spirits have no sensation, when in reality they have much keener sensation than we do. (Evil spirits also use skills unknown in the world to make others feel sensations almost exactly like those of the body, although bodily sensations are actually much more blunted.) </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 969</b></p><p><b>969.</b>
In so great a kingdom, where all the souls of men from the first creation flock together, from this earth alone nearly a million coming every week, and each person among them all having his own individual 
genius and nature; and where there is a communication of all the ideas of everyone; and where notwithstanding all this, all things both in general and in particular must be reduced into order, and 
this continually; it cannot be but that numberless things exist there which have never entered into the idea of man. And as in relation to hell, as well as in relation to heaven, scarcely anyone has 
conceived more than one single obscure idea, it cannot be but that these things will appear strange and wonderful, especially from the fact that men suppose spirits to have no sense of feeling, although 
the truth is that they feel more exquisitely than do men, and what is more have induced on them by evil spirits, by artifices unknown in this world, a sense of feeling almost like that of the body, 
but much more gross. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 969</b></p><p><b>969.</b>
In so large a kingdom where all human souls have been converging since the start of creation (almost a million from this planet every week) where each person's character and disposition is different 
from everybody else's, where all the ideas of everyone are communicated, and where nevertheless every single thing has to be, and is constantly being, restored to proper order, it is inevitable that countless 
things manifest themselves there which have never entered anyone's head. Now since scarcely anyone has anything more than one vague concept of hell, as they have of heaven, these matters will 
inevitably strike them as strange and extraordinary, especially as they imagine that spirits do not have any sensory perception, when in fact these have keener sensory perception than men do. In addition 
to this, by devices unknown in the world, evil spirits produce within such persons sensory feelings almost the same as those of the body which are duller by far. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 969</b>
</p><b>969.</b>
In tanto regno, ubi omnes hominum animae a prima creatione confluunt, et ex hac tellure paene millies mille quavis septimana, et omnes suum genium et suam naturam ab aliorum diversam habent, et omnium 
cujusvis idearum communicatio datur, et usque omnia et singula in ordinem redigenda et hoc continue, non aliter fieri potest quam quod indefinita ibi existant quae nusquam in hominis ideam venerunt; 
et quia de inferno sicut de caelo vix aliquis ullam nisi unicam obscuram ideam concepit, non potest aliter quam quod haec peregrina et mira obventura sint; imprimis ex eo quod putent spiritus non habere 
ullum sensum, cum tamen exquisitiorem habent quam homines; etiam a malis spiritibus, artificiis in mundo ignotis, superinducitur iis sensus paene sicut corporeus, qui multo crassior est. </p>
