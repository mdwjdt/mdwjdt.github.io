<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7232.</strong>出埃及记6:26-30.这亚伦和摩西，耶和华曾对他们说，将以色列人按着他们的军队从埃及地领出来。这些就是那对埃及王法老说要将以色列人从埃及领出来的。就是这摩西和亚伦。当耶和华在埃及地对摩西说话的日子，耶和华告诉摩西说，我是耶和华；我对你说的一切话，你都要告诉埃及王法老。摩西在耶和华面前说，看哪，我口中没受割礼，法老怎肯听我呢？<br />“这亚伦和摩西”表这些人或这教会当中的教义和神之律法源于他们。“耶和华曾对他们说”表命令来自他们。“将以色列人从埃及地领出来”表那些属于主的属灵国度的人将被解救出来。“按着他们的军队”表照着真理里面的良善的属和种。“这些就是那对埃及王法老说的”表来自他们对那些通过完全的虚假进行侵扰之人的警告。“要将以色列人从埃及领出来”表要离开他们，不侵扰他们。“就是这摩西和亚伦”表这警告来自神之律法和源于它的教义。“当耶和华在埃及地对摩西说话的日子”表那时教会的状态，就是当命令通过从神来的律法被赐给那些属于主的属灵国度的人，然而他们仍与地狱里的人非常接近的时候。“耶和华告诉摩西说”表来自神性的教导。“我是耶和华”表神性的确认。“我对你说的一切话，你都要告诉埃及王法老”表从神性流入的事物给予那些通过完全的虚假进行侵扰之人的警告。“摩西在耶和华面前说”表那些沉浸于虚假的人对于神之律法的思维。“看哪，我口中没受割礼”表它是不洁的。“法老怎肯听我呢”表因此，那些沉浸于虚假的人不会接受它。</p>

Verses 26-30. This is the Aaron and Moses to whom Jehovah said, Lead forth the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies. These are they who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to lead 
forth the sons of Israel from Egypt. This is the Moses and Aaron. And it was in the day that Jehovah spoke unto Moses in the land of Egypt. And Jehovah spoke unto Moses, saying, I am Jehovah; speak 
thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak unto thee. And Moses said before Jehovah, Behold I am uncircumcised in lips, and how shall Pharaoh hear me? "This is the Aaron and Moses," signifies 
that from them was doctrine and the law Divine with that church; "to whom Jehovah said," signifies from whom was the command; "Lead forth the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt," signifies that those 
who are of the Lord's spiritual kingdom should be liberated; "according to their armies," signifies according to the genera and species of good in truths; "these are they who spoke to Pharaoh king 
of Egypt," signifies a warning from them to those who infest by mere falsities; "to lead forth the sons of Israel from Egypt," signifies that they should leave, and not infest them; "this is the Moses 
and Aaron," signifies that this was from the law from the Divine, and from the doctrine thence derived; "and it was in the day that Jehovah spoke unto Moses in the land of Egypt," signifies the state 
of the church then when command was given through the law from the Divine to those who are of the Lord's spiritual kingdom, when as yet they were in proximity to those who are in the hells; "and Jehovah 
spoke unto Moses, saying," signifies instruction from the Divine; "I am Jehovah," signifies Divine confirmation; "speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak unto thee," signifies warnings 
to those who infest by mere falsities given by the things that flow in from the Divine; "and Moses said before Jehovah," signifies thought about the law Divine among those who are in falsities; "Behold 
I am uncircumcised in lips," signifies that it is impure; "and how shall Pharaoh hear me?" signifies that thus they who are in falsities will not receive. </p>

Verses 26-30 It was this Aaron and Moses to whom Jehovah said, Lead the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt according to their armies. These are the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to 
lead the children of Israel out of Egypt. It was this Moses and Aaron. And so it was on the day Jehovah spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt, that Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, I am Jehovah; speak 
to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak to you. And Moses said before Jehovah, Behold, I am uncircumcised in the lips, and how will Pharaoh hear<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> me? 'It was this Aaron and Moses' means that it was 
from these that the teachings and the law of God among those people sprang. 'To whom Jehovah said' means from whom a command came. 'Lead the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt' means that those 
who belonged to the Lord's spiritual kingdom were to be delivered. 'According to their armies' means in accordance with the genera and species of good within truths. 'These are the ones who spoke to 
Pharaoh king of Egypt' means the warning from them to those who molest by means of utter falsities. 'To lead the children of Israel out of Egypt' means to leave them and not molest them. 'It was this 
Moses and Aaron' means that this warning came from the law from God and the teachings derived from it. 'And so it was on the day Jehovah spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt' means the state of the Church 
at that time, when the command was given through the law from God to those who belonged to the Lord's spiritual kingdom, when they were still in close proximity to those in hell. 'That Jehovah spoke 
to Moses, saying' means instruction from the Divine. 'I am Jehovah' means Divine confirmation. 'Speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak to you' means warnings given to those who molest by 
means of utter falsities, warnings delivered by things that flow in from the Divine. 'And Moses said before Jehovah' means the thought regarding the law of God that those steeped in falsities entertained. 
'Behold, I am uncircumcised in the lips' means that it is impure. 'And how will Pharaoh hear me?' means that for that reason those steeped in falsities are not going to accept it.

Vers. 26-30.  (x)Hic Aharon et Moscheh, quibus dixit Jehovah, Educite filios Israelis e terra Aegypti juxta exercitus illorum.  Hi loquentes ad Pharaonem regem Aegypti, ad educendum filios Israelis
