<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9334.</strong>“恐怕地成为荒凉”表在这种情况下的一种缺乏，和极少的属灵生命，也就是说，如果这种移走是仓促之间完成的。这从“地”和“荒凉”的含义清楚可知。“地”是指教会，无论总体上的还是具体的。具体的教会就是变成一个教会的一个人；因为教会存在于人里面，并构成一个已重生的人。“地”表示总体上的教会（参看<a href="9325.htm">9325</a>节）；也表示具体的教会，或一个已经重生的人（<a href="82.htm">82</a>，<a href="620.htm">620</a>，<a href="636.htm">636</a>，<a href="913.htm">913</a>，<a href="1411.htm">1411</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>e，<a href="2571.htm">2571</a>，<a href="3368.htm">3368</a>，<a href="3379.htm">3379</a>节）。在玛拉基书，一个重生之人也被称为“地”：<br />众民族必称你们为有福的，因你们必成为喜乐之地！（玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛3.12.htm">3:12</a>）<br />“荒凉”是指一种缺乏，和极少的属灵生命；因为“荒凉”在论及一个人里面的教会时，表示真理和良善的一种缺乏，因而也表示属灵生命的一种缺乏；因为属灵生命就是由这些提供的。<br />至于如果虚假和邪恶仓促之间被移走，就会有一种缺乏和极少的属灵生命，情况是这样：当一个人正通过属灵真理和良善的植入，同时通过虚假和邪恶的移走而重生时，他的重生不是仓促之间，而是缓慢进行的。原因在于，此人从小所思想、意图，或所做的一切事都被添加到他的生命中，并构成这生命。它们也已经结成一个网，这个网具有这样的性质：没有一样东西能被拿走，除非同时拿走全部，或说，一样也不能移动，除非它们一起被移动。因为一个恶人就是一个地狱的形像，一个善人就是一个天堂的形像；而且，与一个恶人同在的邪恶和虚假像地狱社群那样相互联系在一起，而此人就是地狱社群的一部分；而与一个善人同在的良善和真理则像天堂社群那样相互联系在一起，而此人就是天堂社群的一部分。由此明显可知，与一个恶人同在的邪恶和虚假无法突然被移离原位，只能照着良善和真理从内在依次被植入人的程度而逐渐被移走；因为与一个人同在的天堂移走地狱。如果这种移走突然完成，这个人就会昏过去；因为整个网里面的每一个和一切事物都会陷入混乱，夺走他的生命。<br />人的重生，或天堂生命的植入从他年幼时就开始了，然后一直持续到他在世生命的最后阶段，并且世上的生命结束之后，他的完善会持续到永远（参看<a href="2679.htm">2679</a>，<a href="3203.htm">3203</a>，<a href="3584.htm">3584</a>，<a href="3665.htm">3665</a>，<a href="3690.htm">3690</a>，<a href="3701.htm">3701</a>，<a href="4377.htm">4377</a>，<a href="4551.htm">4551</a>，<a href="4552.htm">4552</a>，<a href="5126.htm">5126</a>，<a href="6751.htm">6751</a>，<a href="9103.htm">9103</a>，<a href="9296.htm">9296</a>，<a href="9297.htm">9297</a>；尤其<a href="5122.htm">5122</a>，<a href="5398.htm">5398</a>，<a href="5912.htm">5912</a>，<a href="9258.htm">9258</a>节）。而且（这是一个奥秘），过着一种良善生活的人在来世会经历完善，这一点从前面关于小孩子（<a href="2289.htm">2289</a>-<a href="2309.htm">2309</a>节），以及外邦人在来世的状态和状况（<a href="2589.htm">2589</a>-<a href="2604.htm">2604</a>节）的说明可以看出来。</p>

Lest perchance the land be desolate. That this signifies a deficiency in that case, and but little spiritual life-namely, if the removal should be hasty-is evident from the signification of "the land," 
as being the church in general and also in particular. The church in particular is the man who becomes a church; for the church is in man, and is the regenerated man. (That "the land" denotes the church 
in general, see n. 9325; and that it denotes the church in particular, or the regenerated man, n. 82, 620, 636, 913, 1411, 1733, 2117, 2118e, 2571, 3368, 3379.) A regenerate man is called "a land" 
also in Malachi: </p>
<p>     All nations shall proclaim you blessed, for ye shall be a well-pleasing land (Mal. 3:12). And from the signification of "desolate," as being a deficiency and but little of spiritual 
life; for by "desolate," when said of the church in man, is signified a lack of truth and of good, thus also a lack of spiritual life; for spiritual life is thence derived. [2] In regard to 
there being a deficiency and but little of spiritual life if falsities and evils were hastily removed, the case is this. When a man is being regenerated, which is effected by the implanting of spiritual 
truth and good, and by the removal at the same time of falsity and evil, he is not regenerated hastily, but slowly. The reason is that all things the man, from his infancy, has thought, intended, and 
done, have added themselves to his life, and have made it, and likewise have formed such a connection among themselves that no one thing can be taken away unless all are taken away at the same time. 
For an evil man is an image of hell, and a good man is an image of heaven; and the evils and falsities with an evil man have such a connection among themselves as there is among the infernal societies, 
of which he is a part; and the goods and truths with a good man have such a connection among themselves as there is among the heavenly societies, of which he is a part. From this it is evident that 
the evils and falsities with an evil man cannot be removed from their place suddenly; but only in proportion as goods and truths are implanted in their order, and interiorly; for heaven in a man removes 
hell from him. If this were done suddenly, the man would fail; for each and all things that are in connection and form would be disturbed, and would take away his life. [3] (That regeneration, or 
the implanting of the life of heaven in man, begins from his infancy and continues even to the last of his life in the world, and that after his life in the world it is perfected to eternity, see n. 
2679, 3203, 3584, 3665, 3690, 3701, 4377, 4551, 4552, 5126, 6751, 9103, 9296, 9297; especially n. 5122, 5398, 5912, 9258.) Moreover-and this is a secret-man's regeneration in the world is only a plane 
for the perfecting of his life to eternity. (That a man who has lived in good is perfected in the other life, may be seen from what has been shown concerning infants, n. 2289-2309; and concerning the 
state and lot of the Gentiles in that life, n. 2589-2604.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9334</b></p><p><b>9334.</b>
'Lest perhaps the land becomes desolate' means a deficiency in that case, and little spiritual life, that is to say, if the removal were hurried. This is clear from the meaning of 'the land' as the Church 
in general and also in particular, the Church in particular being a person who becomes an embodiment of the Church, since the Church exists within a person and comprises one who has been regenerated 
(for the meaning of 'the land' as the Church in general, see <a href="9325.htm">9325</a>, and for its meaning as the Church in particular, or a person who has been regenerated, <a href="82.htm">82</a>, <a href="620.htm">620</a>, <a href="636.htm">636</a>, <a href="913.htm">913</a>, <a href="1411.htm">1411</a>, <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>, <a href="2118.htm">2118</a> 
(end), <a href="2571.htm">2571</a>, <a href="3368.htm">3368</a>, <a href="3379.htm">3379</a>; this person is also called 'the land' in Malachi,  </p>
<blockquote>
All the nations will declare you blessed, and you will be a land of delight. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mal%203:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mal 3:12</a>.)  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>and from the meaning of 'desolate' 
as a deficiency, and little spiritual life. For 'desolate', when used in reference to the Church within a person, means a deficiency of truth and good, thus also a deficiency of spiritual life 
since that life is provided by these. The implications of this, that there is a deficiency and little spiritual life if falsities and evils are removed hurriedly, are that when a person undergoes regeneration, 
which is accomplished by the implantation of spiritual truth and good, and at the same time by the removal of falsity and evil, the regeneration is not hurried but takes place slowly.  
</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
The reason for this is that all the things the person has thought, intended, or done since early childhood have entered into the composition of his life. They have also formed themselves into a network 
which is such that one cannot be moved without all of them together being moved. For a wicked person is an image of hell, and a good person is an image of heaven; and also the evils and falsities 
with a wicked person are interconnected in the same way as the communities of hell are with one another, of which that person is a part, while the forms of good and the truths with a good person are 
interconnected in the same way as heavenly communities are with one another, of which this person is a part. From this it is evident that the evils and falsities with a wicked person cannot be removed 
suddenly from where they are. They can be removed only in the measure that forms of good and truths in their proper order have been implanted more deeply within the person; for heaven with a person removes 
hell. If the removal were done suddenly the person would pass out, for the whole network of things, every single one, would be thrown into confusion and deprive him of his life.  
</p>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 The fact 
that regeneration or the implantation of the life of heaven with a person begins when he is a young child and continues right on to the final phase of his life in the world, and the fact that after 
life in the world his perfection continues for evermore, see <a href="2679.htm">2679</a>, 
<a href="3203.htm">3203</a>, <a href="3584.htm">3584</a>, <a href="3665.htm">3665</a>, 
<a href="3690.htm">3690</a>, <a href="3701.htm">3701</a>, <a href="4377.htm">4377</a>, 
<a href="4551.htm">4551</a>, <a href="4552.htm">4552</a>, <a href="5126.htm">5126</a>, 
<a href="6751.htm">6751</a>, <a href="8772.htm">8772</a>, <a href="9103.htm">9103</a>, 
<a href="9296.htm">9296</a>, <a href="9297.htm">9297</a>, and in particular

<a href="9258.htm">9258</a>. 
<p>Also, and 
this is an arcanum, a person's regeneration in the world is merely the foundation for the unending perfection of his life. The person who has led a good life undergoes perfection in the next life; 
see what has been shown regarding young children, in <a href="2289.htm">2289</a>-<a href="2309.htm">2309</a>, and regarding the state and condition of gentiles there, in <a href="2589.htm">2589</a>-<a href="2604.htm">2604</a>.

`Ne forte sit terra desolata': quod significet deficientiam tunc et parum vitae spiritualis, si nempe remotio foret festina, constat ex significatione `terrae' quod sit Ecclesia in communi et quoque 
in particulari; Ecclesia in particulari est homo qui fit Ecclesia, nam Ecclesia est in homine et est homo regeneratus; quod `terra' sit Ecclesia in communi, videatur n. 9325, et quod terra' sit Ecclesia

et eritis vos terra beneplaciti, iii 12; </p>
<p>et ex significatione `desolatae' quod sit deficientia et parum vitae spiritualis; per `desolatam' enim cum de Ecclesia in homine dicitur, significatur defectus 
veri et boni, ita quoque defectus vitae spiritualis, nam vita spiritualis inde est. 	[2] Cum hoc quod deficientia et parum vitae spiritualis sit, si falsa et mala (x)festine removentur, ita se habet: 
homo cum regeneratur, quod fit per implantationem veri et boni spiritualis, et tunc per remotionem falsi et mali, non (x)festine regeneratur sed lente; causa est quia omnia quae homo cogitaverat, 
intenderat, et fecerat ab infantia, (x)se addiderunt vitae ejus et fecerunt illam, et quoque inter se talem nexum formaverunt ut unum non possit amoveri nisi simul omnia; homo enim malus est imago inferni, 
et homo bonus est imago caeli; et quoque mala et falsa apud hominem malum, talem nexum inter se habent qualem inter se societates infernales, quarum pars est; et bona ac vera apud hominem bonum, 
talem nexum inter se habent qualem inter se societates caelestes, quarum pars est; inde patet quod mala et falsa apud hominem malum non removeri loco possint subito, sed quantum bona et vera suo ordine 
ac interius (x)implantata sunt, nam caelum apud hominem removet infernum; si id subito fieret, deficeret homo, turbarentur enim omnia et singula quae in nexu et forma, ac (x)auferrent vitam ejus. 	[3]
