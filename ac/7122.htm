<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7122节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7122.</strong>“不去理会虚谎的言语”表免得他们转向真理。这从“理会”和“虚谎的言语”的含义清楚可知：“理会”是指转向；“虚谎的言语”当由那些沉浸于虚假的人来说时，是指真理，因为那些沉浸于虚假的人将真理称为虚假，因而称为“虚谎的言语”，将虚假则称为真理，因为他们处在对立面。这几节在内义上描述了在来世正直的人被虚假侵扰，而且还揭示了他们被侵扰的方式。这种侵扰被允许，是为了能除去虚假，灌输真理；若没有侵扰，这是绝无可能做到的。因为死后，一个人在世时的一切思维、一切意图、一切意愿和一切言行都粘附在他身上，扎根在他的两种记忆中。没有任何东西被抹除；相反，这些东西已铭刻在他的两种记忆中，尤其铭刻在内部记忆中；严格来说，这内部记忆就是他的灵之记忆（参看<a href="2469.htm">2469</a>，<a href="2470.htm">2470</a>，<a href="2474.htm">2474</a>，<a href="2475.htm">2475</a>节）。正因如此，肮脏污秽的东西，以及邪恶和虚假由于人在世上的生活而不可避免地粘附在他身上，使得他所学到的真理和所充满的良善被隐藏起来。<br />因为真理和良善当在这类事物当中时，是无法出现的。因此，在真理和良善能显现，因而在此人能与天上的人交往之前，这些邪恶和虚假有必要被揭露出来，好叫他能看见并认识它们，由此学习何为真理、何为良善。若没有与他自己里面的邪恶和虚假的争战，这是不可能实现的。这种争战实实在在发生，恶灵挑起虚假和邪恶，但如果这个人的目的是良善的，天使就会原谅它们，并灌输真理。他觉得这一切好像发生在他自己里面，如人经历试探时的情形。这一切也被感觉完全是他自己里面正在发生的事；而事实上，这是天使与恶灵在他外面的争战（参看<a href="3927.htm">3927</a>，<a href="4249.htm">4249</a>，<a href="4307.htm">4307</a>，<a href="5036.htm">5036</a>，<a href="6657.htm">6657</a>节）。大量经历使我清楚知道这一切的真相。说这些事是为了叫人们知道，虚假的侵扰为何会发生在那些属于属灵教会的人身上，这几节和接下来的几节在内义上就描述了这种侵扰。</p>

And let them not regard the words of a lie. That this signifies lest they turn to truths, is evident from the signification of "regarding," as being to turn one's self; and from the signification of 
"the words of a lie," when said by those who are in falsities, as being truths; for they who are in falsities call truths falsities, thus "the words of a lie;" and falsities they call truths, for they 
are in what is opposite.      In these verses, in the internal sense, there has now been described the infestation by falsities of the upright in the other life; and there has also been set forth the 
way in which they are infested. Such infestation is permitted to the end that falsities may be removed, and truths be instilled, which cannot possibly be done without infestation; for after death there 
clings to a man, and there is in his memories, everything of his thought in the world, of his intention, of his will, of his speech, and of his action, for nothing is obliterated. That these things 
have been impressed on his memories, especially on the interior memory, which is properly the memory of his spirit, see n. 2469, 2470, 2474, 2475. And this being so, it must needs be that there cling 
to him things foul and filthy, and also evil and false, from his life in the world; and which cause the truths which the man has also learned, and the goods which he has imbued, to be hidden. For truths 
and goods cannot come forth among such things; and therefore before truths and goods can appear, and the man be thus associated with those who are in heaven, it is necessary that these evils and 
falsities be uncovered, so that he may see them and know them, and thus learn what is true and what is good. This cannot possibly be done without combat with the evils and falsities in himself; which 
combat takes place actually, the evil spirits exciting falsities and evils, and the angels excusing if the end has been good, and instilling truths. This is perceived as if it were in himself, as is the 
case with temptation in man, which is felt no otherwise than as being in him, when yet it is the combat of angels with evil spirits outside of him (see n. 3927, 4249, 4307, 5036, 6657). That this is 
so has been granted me to know with certainty from much experience. These things have been said in order that it may be known why infestation by falsities takes place with those who are of the spiritual 
church, which infestation has been treated of in the above verses, and is treated of also in those which follow.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7122</b></p><p><b>7122.</b>
'And pay no attention to lying words' means to keep them from turning towards truths. This is clear from the meaning of 'paying attention to' as turning towards; and from the meaning of 'lying words', 
when the expression is used by those steeped in falsities, as truths, since those steeped in falsities call truths falsities, thus 'lying words', while they call falsities truths. For theirs is a contrary 
attitude of mind. These verses have now described in the internal sense the molestation of the upright in the next life by falsities, and have also disclosed the way in which those people are molested. 
That molestation is allowed to take place to the end that falsities may be removed and truths instilled, which cannot possibly be accomplished without molestation. For after death there clings 
to a person, lodged in [both] his memories,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> all the thought he had in the world, all his intentions, all his will, all that he said, and all that he did. Nothing is wiped out; rather, these things 
have become imprinted in his memories, especially his interior memory, which is strictly speaking the memory belonging to his spirit, see <a href="2469.htm">2469</a>, <a href="2470.htm">2470</a>, <a href="2474.htm">2474</a>, <a href="2475.htm">2475</a>. And because this is so, things which are 
foul and disgusting, as well as evils and falsities, inevitably cling to the person as a result of his life in the world and cause the truths which he has also learned and the forms of good which he 
has adopted to be hidden from view. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Truths and forms of good when amid those kinds of things cannot come into view. Therefore before truths and forms of good can be seen, thus before the person 
can enter into association with those in heaven, it is necessary for those evils and falsities to be revealed, in order that he may see them and know them for what they are, and thereby learn what 
truth is and what good is. This cannot possibly be accomplished without conflict with the evils and falsities present in him. An actual conflict takes place in which evil spirits stir up falsities and 
evils, but angels excuse them, if the person's end in view has been good, and instill truths. It feels to him as though this were going on within himself, as with a person's experience of temptation. 
This too is felt to be altogether something going on within himself, when in fact it is a conflict taking place between angels and evil spirits outside him. On this subject, see <a href="3927.htm">3927</a>, <a href="4249.htm">4249</a>, <a href="4307.htm">4307</a>, <a href="5036.htm">5036</a>, <a href="6657.htm">6657</a>. Much experience has enabled me to have definite knowledge of the truth of all this. These things have been stated in order that people may know why molestation by falsities happens to those who 
belong to the spiritual Church, as described in the internal sense of these verses and also those that follow.

`Et ne respiciant ad verba mendacii': quod significet ne se vertant ad vera, constat ex significatione `respicere' quod sit se vertere; et ex significatione `verborum mendacii' cum dicitur ab illis 
(x)qui in falsis sunt, quod sint vera; nam qui in falsis sunt vera vocant falsa, ita verba mendacii, et falsa vocant vera, sunt enim in opposito.  In his versibus in sensu interno {1}nunc descripta est 
infestatio proborum in altera vita a falsis, {2}et quoque expositus est modus quo infestantur; quod infestatio illa permittatur, est ob finem ut falsa removeantur et vera insinuentur, quod nequaquam 
fieri potest absque infestatione; adhaeret enim homini et inest ejus memoriis post mortem omne cogitationis ejus in mundo, omne intentionis, omne voluntatis, omne loquelae, et omne actionis ejus, nam 
nihil {3}obliteratur; sed quod haec memoriis ejus, imprimis memoriae interiori, quae proprie est memoria ejus spiritus, {4}impressa sint, videatur n. 2469, 2470, 2474, 2475; et quia ita est, non potest 
aliter quam quod foeda et spurca, et quoque mala {5}et falsa, ex vita in mundo, adhaereant, et faciant ut vera quae quoque homo addidicit, 2 et bona quae imbuit, abscondantur; nam vera et bona inter 
talia non prodire possunt; quapropter antequam vera et bona possunt apparere, et sic (c)is associari illis qui in caelo, necessum est ut mala et falsa illa revelentur, ut videat illa et cognoscat illa, 
et sic discat quid verum et quid bonum; hoc nequaquam fieri potest absque pugna cum malis et falsis apud se, quae pugna fit actualiter; spiritus mali excitant falsa et mala, {6}et angeli excusant 
si finis fuerit bonus, ac insinuant vera; hoc percipitur sicut foret in ipso, {7}sicut etiam tentatio apud hominem, quae non aliter sentitur quam quod sit in illo, cum tamen est pugna angelorum cum spiritibus 
malis extra illum, (d)de qua re videatur n. 3927, 4249, 4307, 5036, 6657; quod ita se res habeat, ex multa experientia pro certo scire datum est.  Haec dicta sunt ut sciatur cur infestatio a 
falsis {8}fit illis qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, de qua infestatione in his versibus in sensu interno actum est, et quoque in sequentibus agitur. 	@1 describitur$ 	@2 quae injiciuntur ab infernis; quae 
infestatio permittitur$ 	@3 obliteratum est$ 	@4 impressum est, ibi est liber ejus vitae$ 	@5 ex amore sui et mundi, et quoque$ 	@6 at$ 	@7 non aliter ac$ 	@8 sit$ </p>
