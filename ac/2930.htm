<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2930节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2930.</strong>“你们若有意”表若由于发自内心的对真理的情感。这从“有意”（soul）在内义上的含义清楚可知。在圣言的许多经文中，经上都提到“心意”（with heart and soul）或“尽心尽性”（with all the heart and with all the soul），这表示用全部的意愿和全部的理解力。人拥有两种能力，即意愿和理解力，并且意愿与理解力分离。这一事实谁都可以知道，因为我们全都能理解善与真，却意愿恶与假。人类起初是以这样的方式被造的，即他的意愿和理解力要成为一体，因此他不可思想这事，却意愿那事，也不可意愿这事，却思想那事。这就是属天之人所具有的状态，这在被称为“人”或“亚当”的属天教会也是如此。但对于属灵之人或在属灵教会，这两种能力是彼此分离的，也就是说，理解力和意愿是彼此分离的。主改造的是属灵之人的理解力，也就是其心智的理解力部分，然后在这理解力部分形成一个新意愿和一个新理解力（参看<a href="863.htm">863</a>，<a href="875.htm">875</a>，<a href="895.htm">895</a>，<a href="897.htm">897</a>，<a href="927.htm">927</a>，<a href="928.htm">928</a>，<a href="1023.htm">1023</a>，<a href="1043.htm">1043</a>，<a href="1044.htm">1044</a>，<a href="2256.htm">2256</a>节）。在该理解力部分，从主所接受的新意愿就是那被称为“心”的，而新理解力则是那被称为“意”（soul）的。当经上说“尽心尽性”（with all the heart and with all the soul）时，意思是说用全部的意愿和全部的理解力。<br />这就是摩西书中“尽心尽性”（heart and soul）所表示的：<br />你要尽心、尽性、尽力爱耶和华你的神。这些话都要记在心上。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申6.5.htm">6:5</a>）<br /><br />以色列啊，现在耶和华你神向你所要的是什么呢？只要你敬畏耶和华你的神，遵行祂的道，爱祂，尽心尽性事奉耶和华你的神。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申10.12.htm">10:12</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申11.13.htm">11:13</a>）<br /><br />耶和华你的神今日吩咐你行这些律例典章，所以你要尽心尽性谨守遵行。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申26.16.htm">26:16</a>）<br />列王纪：<br />大卫对所罗门说，耶和华必成就向我所应许的话，说，你的子孙若谨慎他们所行的路，尽心尽意、诚诚实实地行在我面前，就不从你那里断人坐以色列的宝座。（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上2.4.htm">2:4</a>）<br />马太福音：<br />你要尽心、尽性爱主你的神。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.37.htm">22:37</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.29.htm">12:29</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.30.htm">30</a>）<br />这个词同样用来论及耶和华或主，因为对教会成员而言，属于意愿的对良善的情感和属于理解力的对真理的情感就源于主。如撒母耳记： <br />我要为自己立一个忠心的祭司，他必照我的心意而行。（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上2.35.htm">2:35</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />我必欢喜施恩与他们，要尽心尽意、诚诚实实将他们栽于此地。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶32.41.htm">32:41</a>）<br />在圣言的其它地方，“尽性或尽意”（soul）表对真理的情感，如以赛亚书：<br />夜间，我尽性渴慕你，我当中的灵切切寻求你，因为你在地上行审判的时候，世上的居民就学习公义。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛26.9.htm">26:9</a>）<br />此处“尽性”（soul）表对真理的情感；“灵”表对良善的情感。“审判”论及真理，“公义”论及良善（参看<a href="2235.htm">2235</a>节）。<br />同一先知书：<br />愚顽人必说愚顽话，使饥饿的灵魂（soul）肚子空空，使口渴的灵魂无所可喝。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛32.6.htm">32:6</a>）<br />愚顽人使之肚子空空的“饥饿的灵魂”表对良善的渴望；使之无所可喝“口渴的灵魂”表对真理的渴望。耶利米书：<br />他们的灵魂必像浇灌的园子，疲乏的灵魂，我使他饱饫；一切愁烦的灵魂，我使他满足。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.12.htm">31:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.25.htm">25</a>）<br />此处“灵魂”表对良善与真理的情感。<br />她所有的人民都叹息，寻求食物；他们用美物换粮食，要救性命（soul）。救我性命的保惠师离我甚远。我的儿女孤苦。我招呼我所亲爱的，他们却愚弄我。他们为自己录求食物救性命。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀1.11.htm">1:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀1.16.htm">16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀1.19.htm">19</a>）<br />“性命”（soul）表对良善与真理的情感之生命；“食物”表智慧和聪明。<br />前面说过，“有意”（soul）表发自内心的对真理的情感，因为并非发自内心的对真理的某种情感是存在的。如出于我欲，也就是渴望凌驾于他人之上的情感；出于物欲，也就是喜爱获取利益的情感；还有出于喜爱邀功的情感。对真理的情感以同样的方式源于这些爱，但它们并非纯正的情感。它们出自肉体的情欲（the will of the flesh），而非发自内心。凡发自内心的皆来自主。此外，在圣言中，“性命或灵魂”（soul）在普遍意义上表示一切生命（参看<a href="1000.htm">1000</a>，<a href="1005.htm">1005</a>，<a href="1040.htm">1040</a>，<a href="1742.htm">1742</a>节）。事实上，就普遍意义而言，“性命或灵魂”（soul）构成那另外的事物从中拥有其存在和生命之物。因此，肉体的性命或灵魂就是它的灵，因为肉体由此拥有生命。然而，灵的性命或灵魂是其更为内在的生命，灵便从该生命拥有智慧和聪明。</p>

If it is with your soul. That this signifies if it is from the affection of truth from the heart, is evident from the signification of "soul" in the internal sense. In many passages of the Word it is 
said "from the heart and from the soul," or "from the whole heart and from the whole soul," and by this is signified that it is from all the will and all the understanding. That man has two faculties, 
namely, will and understanding, may be known to everyone; also that the will is a separate faculty from the understanding, for we are able to understand good and truth and yet will what is evil and 
false. From the beginning man was so created that his will and understanding should make a one, so that he should not think one thing and will another, nor will one thing and think another. Such is the 
state with the celestial, and such it was in the celestial church, which was called "Man" or "Adam." But with the spiritual, or in the spiritual church, one faculty has been separated from the other, 
that is, the understanding from the will; and the man is reformed by the Lord as to the intellectual part, and in this there is formed a new will and a new understanding (see n. 863, 875, 895, 897, 
927, 928, 1023, 1044, 2256). The new will which is from the Lord, in this part, is what is called "heart," and the new understanding is what is called "soul;" and when it is said, "from all the heart 
and from all the soul," by this is meant from all the will and from all the understanding. [2] This is what is meant by "heart and soul" in Moses: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, 
and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength (Deut. 6:5). And again: </p>
<p>     Now, O Israel, what doth Jehovah thy God require of thee, but to fear Jehovah thy God, to walk in all His ways, and 
to love Him, and to serve Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul (Deut. 10:12; 11:13). Again: </p>
<p>     This day Jehovah thy God commandeth thee to do these statutes and judgments; and 
thou shalt keep and do them with all thy heart and with all thy soul (Deut. 26:16). in the book of Kings: </p>
<p>     David said to Solomon, Jehovah will establish His word which He spoke concerning me, 
saying, If thy sons take heed to their way to walk before Me in truth, with all their heart and with all their soul; there shall not be cut off from thee a man from upon the throne of Israel (1 Kings 
2:4). In Matthew: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul (Matt. 22:37; Mark 12:29, 30). [3] The same is also predicated of Jehovah or the Lord, because thence 
comes the affection of good which is of the will, and the affection of truth which is of the understanding, with the man of the church. As in Samuel: </p>
<p>     I will raise Me up a faithful priest, according 
to that which is in My heart and in My soul (1 Sam. 2:35). And in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land in truth, with all My heart and with 
all My soul (Jer. 32:41). And in other passages throughout the Word, "soul" signifies the affection of truth, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     With my soul have I desired Thee in the night; yea, with my spirit 
in the midst of me have I sought Thee early; for according to Thy judgments to the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness (Isa. 26:9); </p>
<p>here "soul" denotes the affection of truth; "spirit," 
the affection of good (that "judgments" are predicated of truths, and "righteousness" of good, may be seen above, n. 2235). [4] In the same: </p>
<p>     The fool speaketh folly, to make empty the 
hungry soul; and to cause the thirsty for drink to fail (Isa. 32:6); </p>
<p>the "hungry soul" denotes the desire for good, which the fool maketh empty; the "soul thirsty for drink" denotes the desire for truth, 
which the fool causeth to fail. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Their soul shall be as a watered garden, and I will water the wearied soul, and every sorrowful soul will I fill (Jer. 31:12, 25); </p>
<p>here "soul" 
denotes the affection of good and of truth. Again: </p>
<p>     All her people sigh, they seek bread, they have given their pleasant things for food to restore the soul. The comforter that restoreth my soul 
is far from me; my sons are desolate. They sought food for themselves, to restore their soul (Lam. 1:11, 16, 19); </p>
<p>"soul" denotes the life of the affection of good and truth; "food," wisdom and intelligence. [5] 
It is said that "soul" signifies the affection of truth from the heart, because there are affections of truth which are not from the heart; as those which are from the love of self or of 
being eminent, from the love of the world or of making gain, also from the love of meriting; from these in like manner there come forth affections of truth, but they are not genuine; being from the will 
of the flesh, and not from the heart: that which is from the heart is from the Lord. Moreover "soul" in the Word signifies in the universal sense all life (see n. 1000, 1005, 1040, 1742) for in the 
universal sense the soul is that from which another thing is, and lives; thus the soul of the body is its spirit, for from this the body lives; but the soul of the spirit is its still more internal life, 
from which it has wisdom and understanding. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2930</b></p><p><b>2930.</b>
'If you are willing' means if on account of an affection for truth coming from the heart. This is clear from the meaning of 'soul' in the internal sense. The expression 'with heart and soul' or 'with 
all the heart and with all the soul' occurs in various places in the Word where with all the will and all the understanding is meant. The fact that man possesses the dual powers of will and understanding, 
and also that the will is separated from the understanding may be well known to everyone, for we are all able to understand what is good and true but nevertheless will what is evil and false. From 
the beginning the human being was created in such a way that will and understanding with him were to make one, so that he would not think anything other than what he willed, nor will anything other 
than what he thought. Such is the state with celestial people and such it was in the celestial Church which was called Man or Adam. But with spiritual people, that is, in the spiritual Church, the first 
ability is separated from the second, that is to say, that of the understanding is separated from that of the will. A spiritual person is reformed by the Lord as to the former, namely the understanding 
part of his mind, and then within this there is formed a new will and a new understanding, <a href="863.htm">863</a>, <a href="875.htm">875</a>, <a href="895.htm">895</a>, <a href="897.htm">897</a>, <a href="927.htm">927</a>, <a href="928.htm">928</a>, <a href="1023.htm">1023</a>, <a href="1043.htm">1043</a>, <a href="1044.htm">1044</a>, <a href="2256.htm">2256</a> </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The new will there, which is received from 
the Lord, is what is called 'the heart', while the new understanding is what is called 'the soul'. And when the expression 'with all the heart and with all the soul' is used, with all the will and with 
all the understanding is meant. This is what is meant by 'heart and soul' in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
This day Jehovah your God is commanding you to observe these statutes and judgements - that you may keep and observe 
them with all your heart and with all your soul. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2026:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 26:16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
You shall love Jehovah your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%206:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 6:5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same 
author, </p>
<blockquote>
Now Israel, what does Jehovah your God require of you except to fear Jehovah your God, to go in all His ways, and to love Him, and to serve Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all 
your soul? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2010:12;%2011:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 10:12; 11:13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author, </p>
<p>In the Book of Kings, </p>
<p>David said to Solomon, Jehovah will establish His Word which He spoke concerning me, saying, If [your] sons take heed 
to their way to walk before Me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there will not fail you a man on the throne of Israel. <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 2:4. </p>
<p>In Matthew, </p>
<p>You shall love the Lord your 
God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. Matt. 22:37; Mark 12:29, <a href="30.htm">30</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The same is also said of Jehovah or the Lord because with the member of the Church He is 
the source of affection for good, which belongs to the will, and of the affection for truth, which belongs to the understanding; as in Samuel, </p>
<p>I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest, [who will 
do] according to what is in My heart and in My soul. <a href="1.htm">1</a> Sam. 2:35. </p>
<p>And in Jeremiah, </p>
<p>I will rejoice over them to do good to them, and I will plant them in this land in truth, with all My heart, 
and with all My soul. Jer. 32:41. </p>
<p>And there are still other places in the Word where 'soul' means the affection for truth, as in Isaiah, </p>
<p>With my soul I desired You in the night; even with my spirit 
within me I sought You early. For insofar as Your judgements are in the earth the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness. Isa. 26:9. </p>
<p>Here 'soul' stands for an affection for truth, 'spirit' 
for an affection for good. 'Judgements' has reference to truths, and 'righteousness' to good, see <a href="2235.htm">2235</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<p>The fool speaks folly, to make empty the hungry soul, and causes 
the [soul] thirsting for drink to fail. Isa. 32:6. </p>
<p>'The hungry soul', which 'the fool makes empty', stands for the desire for good, while 'the soul thirsting for drink', which 'the fool causes 
to fail', stands for the desire for truth. In Jeremiah, </p>
<p>Their soul will become like a watered garden, and I will water the weary soul, and every sorrowful soul I will replenish. Jer. 31:12, <a href="25.htm">25</a>. </p>
<p>'The 
soul' stands for the affection for truth and good. In the same prophet, </p>
<p>All its people groan as they search for bread. They have given their desirable things for food, to revive the soul. A comforter 
is far from me, one to revive my soul; my sons have been made desolate. They sought food for themselves to revive their soul. Lam. 1:11, <a href="16.htm">16</a>, <a href="19.htm">19</a>. </p>
<p>'The soul' stands for the life of the affection 
for good and truth, 'food' stands for wisdom and intelligence. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 It has been said that 'the soul' means the affection for truth coming from the heart, because some affections for truth exist 
which do not come from the heart, such as those which come from self-love, which is the desire to be above others; from love of the world, which is the love of gain; and from love of merit. Affections 
for truth spring in a similar way from these loves, but they are not genuine affections. They come from the will of the flesh, not from the heart. That which comes from the heart comes from the Lord. 
Furthermore 'the soul' in the Word means in the universal sense all life, see <a href="1000.htm">1000</a>, <a href="1005.htm">1005</a>, <a href="1040.htm">1040</a>, <a href="1742.htm">1742</a>. Indeed in the universal sense the soul constitutes that from which another thing has its being and 
life. Thus the soul of the body is its spirit, since it is from this that the body has life. The soul of the spirit however is its still more interior life from which it derives its wisdom and intelligence. </p>

`Si est cum anima vestra':  quod significet si ex affectione veri ex corde, constat a significatione `animae' in sensu interno:  in Verbo passim dicitur quod `ex corde et ex anima,' seu `ex toto corde 
et ex tota anima,' et significatur per illa quod ex omni voluntate et ex omni intellectu; quod binae facultates homini sint, nempe voluntas et intellectus, cuivis potest notum esse, tum quod voluntas 
separata facultas sit ab intellectu, nam intelligere possumus bonum et verum, sed usque velle malum et falsum; homo a principio ita creatus est ut voluntas et intellectus apud illum unum facerent, 
sic ut non aliud cogitaret quam vellet, nec aliud vellet quam cogitaret, talis status est apud caelestes, et fuit in caelesti Ecclesia quae `Homo' seu `Adam' dicta; at apud spirituales seu in spirituali 
Ecclesia, est separata una facultas ab altera, nempe intellectualis a voluntaria, et homo quoad illam partem, nempe intellectualem reformatur a Domino, et inibi formatur nova voluntas et novus intellectus, 
n. 863, 875, 895, 897, 927, 928, 1023, 1043, 1044, 2256; [2] nova voluntas ibi, quae a Domino, est quae vocatur `cor,' et novus intellectus qui vocatur `anima,' et cum dicitur `ex toto corde 
et ex tota anima' significatur quod ex omni voluntate et ex omni intellectu:  haec sunt quae significantur per cor et animam, {1}apud Mosen,           Amabis Jehovam Deum tuum omni corde tuo, et omni 
anima      tua, et omnibus viribus tuis, Deut. vi 5: apud eundem,           Nunc Israel, quid Jehovah Deus tuus petens a te, nisi       ad timendum Jehovam Deum tuum, ad eundum in omnibus vii    
  Ipsius, et ad amandum Ipsum, et ad serviendum Jehovae Deo tuo,      omni corde tuo, et omni anima tua? Deut. x 12; xi 13: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           Die hoc Jehovah Deus tuus praecipiens tibi ad faciendum  
    statuta haec et judicia, et custodias et facias illa, toto      corde tu et tota anima tua, Deut. xxvi 16: </p>
<p>in Libro Regum,           David ad Salomonem, Stabiliet Jehovah verbum Suum, quod  
    locutus super me, dicendo, Si custodiunt filii viam suam, ad      ambulandum coram Me in veritate, omni corde suo, et omni anima      sua, dicendo, non exscindetur tibi vir a super throno  
    Israelis, I Reg. ii 4: </p>
<p>apud Matthaeum,           Amabis Dominum Deum tuum ex toto corde tuo, et in tota      anima tua et in tota mente tua, xxii 35 [A. V. 37]; Marc. xii      29, 30. [3] Simile 
praedicatur etiam de Jehovah seu Domino, quia inde affectio boni quae est voluntatis, et affectio veri quae est intellectus, apud hominem Ecclesiae; ut apud Samuelem,           Exsuscitabo Mihi 
sacerdotem fidelem, quemadmodum in       corde Meo, et in anima Mea, I Sam. ii 35: </p>
<p>et apud Jeremiam,           Gaudebo super illis, ad benefaciendum illis, et      plantabo eos in terra hac in veritate, 
omni corde Meo, et omni      anima Mea, xxxii 41. Etiam passim alibi in Verbo `anima' significat affectionem veri, ut apud Esaiam,           Anima mea desideravi Te in nocte, etiam spiritu 
meo in      medio mei quaesivi Te mane, quia quemadmodum judicia Tua       terrae, justitiam discunt habitatores orbis, xxvi 9; </p>
<p>ibi `anima' pro affectione veri, `spiritus' pro affectione boni; quod 
`judicia' praedicentur de veris, et `justitia' de bono, videatur n. 2235:  [4] apud eundem,           Stultus stultitiam loquitur,...ad evacuandum animam           famelicam, et potum sitientem deficere 
faciat, xxxii 6; </p>
<p>`anima famelica' pro desiderio boni, quam `stultus evacuat'; `anima potum sitiens' pro desiderio veri, quam `stultus deficere facit':  apud Jeremiam,           Fiet anima eorum 
sicut hortus irriguus;...et irrigabo      animam lassam, et omnem animam dolentem implebo, xxxi 12, 25; </p>
<p>`anima' pro affectione veri et boni: apud eundem,           Omnis populus ejus gementes, quaerentes 
panem, dederunt      desiderabilia sua pro cibo, ad reducendum animam....Procul est      a me consolans, reducens animam meam, facti sunt filii mei      desolati:...quaesiverunt cibum sibi, 
ut reducerent animam      suam, Thren. i 11, 16, 19; </p>
<p>`anima' pro vita affectionis boni et veri, `cibus' pro sapientia et intelligentia.  [5] Dicitur quod `anima' significet affectionem veri ex corde, 
quia dantur affectiones veri quae non ex corde, ut quae ex amore sui seu eminendi, ex amore mundi seu lucrandi, ex amore merendi; ex his similiter existunt affectiones veri, sed non sunt genuinae, 
sunt ex voluntate carnis, non ex corde; quod ex corde, est ex Domino.  Praeterea `anima' in Verbo significat in universali sensu omnem vitam, videatur n. 1000, 1005, 1040, 1742; anima enim est in universali 
sensu illud ex quo aliud est et vivit, ita anima corporis est ejus spiritus, ex eo enim vivit corpus; anima autem spiritus est ejus vita adhuc interior, ex qua illa sapit et intelligit. </p>
