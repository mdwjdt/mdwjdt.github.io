<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第546节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>546.</strong>为让我了解那些渴望进天堂却不适合在那里之人的情况，有一次我在某个天堂社群，一位天使在我面前显现，模样如同一个婴孩，头上戴着明亮的蓝色花冠，胸间束着其他颜色的花环。我由此得以知道我所在的是仁爱的社群。就在这时，一些诚实的灵被准许进入该社群，他们一进来就更聪明了，谈吐如同天使灵。后来，那些自认纯真之人被允许进来，其状态表现为吐奶的婴儿，这就是他们的样子。此后进来的是那些自以为聪明的人，他们的状态表现在脸上，这脸看上去十分漂亮但尖尖的，他们头上好象戴着一顶尖帽子。然而，他们的脸似乎没有人的肉，仿佛是被雕刻出来的，缺乏生命。这就是那些以为凭自己而属灵，即凭自己拥有信之人的状态。还有些灵被允许进来，但却无法留在那里，他们感到沮丧，越来越不安，就从那里逃走了。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]546.</strong> The following experience was to teach me what happens with people who are eager to enter heaven but are not of a type that can stay there.<br />Once while I was in a community in heaven, an angel appeared to me as a little child wearing a wreath of dazzling sky-blue flowers on its head and garlands of other colors circling its chest. From this sign I was able to recognize that I was in a particular community where charity existed. Then into the same community came some upstanding spirits who on entering suddenly became much more intelligent and started talking like angelic spirits.<br />Next to be admitted was a group of people who claimed to be innocent on their own merits. Their condition was represented to me by a baby spitting up milk. That is what such people are like.<br />Afterward came people who supposed that their own good thinking made them intelligent. Their condition was represented in their faces, which were angular but reasonably attractive. They appeared wearing pointed hats with a protruding spike. Still, their faces did not seem to be made of human flesh but looked like lifeless sculptures. This is the condition of those who believe that they can make themselves spiritual or acquire faith on their own.<br />Other spirits were allowed in who were unable to stay there. Overwhelmed with dismay and anxiety, they fled the place. </p>

In order that I might know how the case is with those who desire to be in heaven and are not such that they can be there, once when I was in some heavenly society, an angel appeared to me as an infant 
with a chaplet of bright blue flowers about its head, and girded about the breast with wreaths of other colors. By this I was given to know that I was in some society where there was charity. Some well-disposed 
spirits were then admitted into the same society, who the moment they entered became much more intelligent, and spoke like angelic spirits. Afterwards some were admitted who desired to be 
innocent from themselves, whose state was represented to me by an infant that vomited milk out of its mouth. Such is their state. Then some were admitted who supposed that they were intelligent from 
themselves, and their state was represented by their faces, which appeared sharp, but fair enough; and they seemed to wear a peaked hat from which a sharp point projected, but their faces did not appear 
to be of human flesh, but as if carved out and devoid of life. Such is the state of those who believe that they are spiritual from themselves, that is, able from themselves to have faith. Other spirits 
were admitted who could not remain there, but were dismayed, became distressed, and fled away. </p>

So that I might know about those people who desire to enter heaven but are not such as can exist there, an angel once appeared to me as a young child while I was present in a heavenly community. He had 
a garland of bright blue flowers around his head, and flowers of other colours twined around his breast. From this I was given to understand that I was present in a community where charity reigned. 
Into that same community certain upright spirits were at that point admitted who, the moment they were coming in, developed greatly in understanding and spoke like angelic spirits. Subsequently those 
who wished to be innocent from themselves were let in. Their condition was represented to me as an infant vomiting milk out of its mouth. That is exactly what those people are like. After that, people 
were admitted who imagined that they were self-intelligent. Their condition was represented in their faces, which looked quite beautiful but pointed. On their heads they seemed to be wearing pointed 
hats with a sharp peak. Their faces however did not look like faces of human flesh but like lifeless carvings. This is the condition of people who believe they are spiritual from themselves, that is, 
who believe that from themselves they can possess faith. Other spirits were admitted who were unable to remain in that place. They were dismayed, grew uneasy, and fled from there.

</p><b>546.</b>
Ut scirem quomodo se habet cum illis qui in caelum cupiunt, et non tales sunt ut ibi esse possint, cum fui in aliqua societate caelesti, visus mihi angelus ut infans, circum caput corolla florum caeruleorum 
splendentium, circum pectus cinctus sertis colorum aliorum; inde cognoscere datum quod in societate quadam essem ubi charitas; tunc in eandem societatem admissi sunt quidam spiritus probi, qui 
ilico cum intrabant, intelligentiores multo facti sunt et locuti sicut spiritus angelici. Postea intromissi qui ex semet innocentes esse vellent, quorum status mihi repraesentabatur per infantem, qui 
lac ore evomebat; taliter ii se habent. Dein admissi qui ex se intelligentes esse putabant; status eorum repraesentabatur per eorum facies, quae apparebant acutae, satis pulchrae; visi pileo instructi 
acuto, ex quo spiculum; sed non apparebant ut facies humanae carneae sed ut sculptilia absque vita; talis est status eorum qui ex semet spirituales esse, seu ex semet fidem habere posse, credunt.  
Alii spiritus admissi qui non poterant ibi morari; consternabantur et anxii facti, inde aufugiebant. </p>
