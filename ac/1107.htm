<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1107节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1107.</strong>由于有些人十分愿意接受消磨，因此，他们从世间带来的谬念就会被去掉。（如果没有足够的时间和主所提供的方法，没有人能在来生去除谬念。）他们在低层世界期间，主会将他们保持在被释放的希望和有望结束的思维中，也就是说，以此法，他们可以被纠正，且准备去接受天堂的幸福。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1107.</strong> Some are very willing to be devastated, or purged, and so rid themselves of the false premises they have dragged with them from the world. (No one can ever shed false assumptions in the next life except over time and through means that the Lord provides.) While they stay in the underground realm, the Lord maintains in them a hope for deliverance. He also keeps them thinking about the goal, which is to change for the better and become ready to accept heaven's happiness. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1107</b></p><p><b>1107.</b>
There are some who are very willing to be vastated and thus get rid of the false principles which they have brought with them from the world. (No one can get rid of his false principles in the other 
life except by the lapse of time and by means provided by the Lord.) While these persons remain in the lower earth, they are kept by the Lord in the hope of deliverance, and in the thought of the end 
in view, which is that they may be amended and prepared to receive heavenly happiness. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1107</b></p><p><b>1107.</b>
There are some who are vastated freely and willingly and so get rid of the false assumptions they have brought with them from the world. (Nobody can possibly get rid of false assumptions in the next 
life without sufficient time and the means provided by the Lord.) Throughout their stay on the lower earth the Lord maintains them in the hope of being set free and in the thought of the end in view, 
namely that in this way they may be corrected and be prepared to receive heavenly happiness. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1107</b>
</p><b>1107.</b>
Sunt quidam qui libenter volunt vastari, et sic exuere principia falsa quae secum e mundo traxerunt, (principia falsa nusquam aliquis potest exuere in altera vita nisi per moram temporis perque media 
a Domino provisa); illi dum in terra inferiore manent, a Domino in spe liberationis tenentur, et in cogitatione finis quod sic emendentur et ad felicitatem caelestem recipiendam praeparentur. </p>
