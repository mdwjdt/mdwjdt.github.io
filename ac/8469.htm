<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8469节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8469.</strong>“按你们的人口数”表足够一个社群里所有人的量，也就是说，“吗哪”所表示的真理之良善的量。这从“按人口数”的含义清楚可知，“按人口数”是指足够一个社群里所有人的量。因为当“一头一俄梅珥”表示足够一个人的量时，“按人口数”就表示足够一个社群里所有人的量。此处论述的主题是那些属于主的属灵国度之人的良善，这良善由“吗哪”来表示，并且将以足够每个人和足够一个社群的量被赐予。因为以色列人的每一户都代表天上的一个社群（参看<a href="7836.htm">7836</a>，<a href="7891.htm">7891</a>，<a href="7996.htm">7996</a>，<a href="7997.htm">7997</a>节）。至于天上的社群，情况是这样：天堂是由无数社群组成的，这些社群彼此有别且互相分离。每个社群都一个有别于其它社群的良善的共享同良善；而且在一个社群里，每个人也都有一个有别于社群里其他所有人的良善的具体良善。一个社群的成员所拥有的良善的不同种类如此地多样化，但又和谐一致；它们构成一个被称为“天堂形式”的形式。整个天堂就是由这类形式构成的。当认为它们是良善的组合时，它们就被称为“形式”；但当认为它们是人的组合时，它们就被称为“社群”。以色列人被划分成各个支派、宗族和家庭就代表这些事。</p>

According to the number of your souls. That this signifies enough for all in the society, namely, of the good of truth which is signified by "the manna," is evident from the signification of "according 
to the number of the souls," as being sufficient for all in the society. For when by "an omer a head" is signified enough for everyone, by "according to the number of the souls" is signified enough 
for all in the society. The subject here treated of is the good of those who are of the Lord's spiritual kingdom, which good is signified by "the manna," and that sufficient of this will be given for 
everyone and sufficient for the society; for each house of the sons of Israel represented one society in heaven (see n. 7836, 7891, 7996, 7997). As regards the societies in heaven the case is this. Heaven 
consists of countless societies, which are distinct one from another. Each society has a general good distinct from the good of other societies; and also each one in a society has a particular good 
distinct from the good of all others in the society. From the distinct goods of those who are in the society, which are thus various, but yet accordant, there is produced a form, which is called "the 
heavenly form." The universal heaven consists of such forms. Relatively to goods these conjunctions are called "forms," but relatively to persons they are called "societies." These things were represented 
by the distinctions of the sons of Israel into tribes, families, and houses. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8469</b></p><p><b>8469.</b>
'The number of your souls' means the amount for all in a community, that is to say, the amount of the good of truth meant by 'the manna'. This is clear from the meaning of 'according to the number of 
souls' as the amount sufficient for all in a community. For when 'an omer a head' means the amount sufficient for each individual, 'according to the number of souls' means the amount for all in a community. 
The subject here is good as it exists with those who belong to the Lord's spiritual kingdom, the good which is meant by 'the manna' and which will be given in an amount sufficient for each person 
and sufficient for a community. For each household among the children of Israel represented one community in heaven, <a href="7836.htm">7836</a>, <a href="7891.htm">7891</a>, <a href="7996.htm">7996</a>, <a href="7997.htm">7997</a>. </p>
<p>The situation with the communities in heaven is that 
heaven is made up of countless communities that are distinct and separate from one another. All in each community share a common good, which is distinct from the good of other communities. Also each 
member of a community possesses a particular kind of good, distinct from the good any other in the community possesses. The different kinds of good that members of a community possess, which are distinct 
and so various but nevertheless compatible, compose a form called a heavenly form. Heaven as a whole is made of such forms. They are called forms when they are thought of as combinations of good, 
but communities when they are thought of as combinations of persons. These things were represented by the divisions of the children of Israel into tribes, families, and households. </p>

`Numerum animarum vestrarum': quod significet quantum omnibus in societate, nempe bonum veri quod per `mannam' significatur, constat ex significatione `ad numerum animarum' quod sit quantum satis ad 
omnes in societate; cum enim per `omerem ad caput' significatur quantum satis cuique, per `ad numerum animarum' significatur quantum {1}omnibus in societate.  Agitur hic de bono quod illis qui (c)e regno

unam societatem in caelo, n. 7836, 7891, 7996, 7997. 	2 Cum societatibus in caelo ita se habet: caelum consistit ex innumeris societatibus, quae inter se distinctae sunt {3}; unaquaevis societas habet
