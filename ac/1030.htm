<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1030.</strong>“凡从方舟里出来的”表该教会成员。“甚至地上一切野兽”表该教会之外的人。这从内义的连贯性清楚可知。因为经上在此重复提及“凡从方舟里出来的，甚至地上一切野兽”之前，就已直接提到了从方舟出来的一切事物，如一切活的灵魂、飞鸟、牲畜和地上的野兽。因此，“地上一切野兽”是第二次被提及，除非它在此表示某种别的事物，否则不会出现这种重复。除此之外，接下来还有“我要与你们立我的约”，这在前面也说过了。由此明显可知，“凡从方舟里出来的”表已重生之人，即该教会成员；而“地上一切野兽”表在该教会之外的全世界所有人。<br />在圣言中，“地上野兽”用来表示活物时，是指那些更为粗鄙、具有不同程度野性的事物，其准确含义取决于它们所论及之物。当论及人里面的事物时，“地上野兽”是指属外在人和肉体的低级事物，诸如刚才本节所提到的那些，因而是指更为粗鄙的那类事物。当论及被称为一个复合人或人身（composite man or person）的整个社群时，“地上野兽”是指那些不属教会的人，因为他们更为粗鄙。意义可能还会有不同，这取决于它所论及的主题。如何西阿书：<br />当那日，我必为他们与田野的野兽和空中的飞鸟，并地上的爬物立约。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何2.18.htm">2:18</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />田野的野兽必尊敬我，因我使沙漠有水，好赐给它们喝。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛43.20.htm">43:20</a>）<br />以西结书：<br />空中的飞鸟都在枝子上搭窝，田野的野兽都在枝条下生子，所有大国的人民都在它荫下居住。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结31.6.htm">31:6</a>）</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1030.</strong> The symbolism of from among all those coming out of the ark as people in the church and of including every wild animal of the earth as a person outside the church can be deduced from the line of reasoning in the inner meaning. Everything that came out of the ark has already been named, in the words every living soul, including bird, beast, and wild animal of the earth. Now it is repeated: from all those coming out of the ark, including every wild animal of the earth. So the wild animal of the earth is mentioned a second time, which it would not be if it did not have another meaning here. The next verse, moreover, continues with the words and I am setting up my pact with you, which was also said before. This indicates that those coming out of the ark symbolizes regenerate individuals, or people in the church, while the wild animal of the earth symbolizes everyone in the entire world outside the church.<br />[2] In Scripture, when the word for "wild animal" does not mean living things,{*1} the wild animal of the earth symbolizes things that are rather base and that partake more or less of a wild animal's nature. The nuances involved depend on the topic that is being dealt with. Where the subject is the attributes inside us, a wild animal of the earth symbolizes the lower capacities of our outer self and our body, as it did in the immediately preceding part of this verse. So it symbolizes rather base things. Where the subject is a whole group of people, which is called a composite person, a wild animal of the earth symbolizes those who are not in the church, because these people are relatively lowly. And so on, depending on the subject at hand. In Hosea, for example:<br />I will strike a pact with them on that day — with the wild animal of the field, and with the bird in the heavens and the creeping animal of the earth. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1030/bible_king-james-version_hosea_2_18" target=_top>Hosea 2:18</a>)<br />In Isaiah:<br />The wild animal of the field will honor me because I have put water in the desert. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1030/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_43_20" target=_top>Isaiah 43:20</a>)<br />In Ezekiel:<br />In its branches nested every bird of the heavens, and under its branches bred every wild animal of the field, and in its shade lived all the great nations. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1030/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_31_6" target=_top>Ezekiel 31:6</a>)<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For discussion of the use of the word for "wild animal," see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1030/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_908" target=_top>908</a>.

Of all that go out of the ark. That this signifies the men of the church, and that "even every wild animal of the earth" signifies the man who is outside the church, is evident from the series of things 
in the internal sense; for all that went forth from the ark have been named before-as every living soul, the fowl, the beast, and the wild animal of the earth-and here it is said again, "of all that 
go out of the ark, even every wild animal of the earth." Thus the "wild animal of the earth" is named a second time, and there would not be this repetition unless something else were here meant. And 
there also follows: "I will establish My covenant with you" as was said before. From this it is evident that by "those going out of the ark" are signified the regenerate, or the men of the church, and 
by the "wild animal of the earth" is signified all in the universe who are outside the church.  [2] The "wild animal of the earth" in the Word, when living things are not meant by it, signifies those 
things which are more vile and partake more or less of the ferine nature, and this in accordance with the subject of which it is predicated. When it is predicated of what is in man, then the "wild 
animal of the earth" signifies lower things which are of the external man and of the body, as presently in this same verse, and thus what is more vile. When it is predicated of an entire society, which 
is called a composite man or person, then the "wild animal of the earth" signifies those who are not of the church, because they are more vile; and so in other cases according to the subject of which 
it is predicated. As in Hosea: </p>
<p>     In that day will I make a covenant for them with the wild animal of the field, and with the fowl of the heavens, and with the creeping thing of the earth (Hos. 
2:18). In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The wild animal of the field shall honor Me, because I give waters in the wilderness (Isa. 43:20). In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     All the birds of the heavens made their nests in his boughs, 
and under his branches all the wild animals of the field brought forth, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations (Ezek. 31:6). </p>

'From all that are going out of the ark' means members of the Church, and 'even every wild animal of the earth' people outside of the Church. This becomes clear from the train of thought in the internal 
sense. For direct reference to everything that went out of the ark being every living soul among birds, beasts, and wild animals of the earth' precedes the statement repeated here, 'from all those 
going out of the ark, even every wild animal of the earth'. 'Wild animal of the earth' is accordingly referred to a second time, which would be mere repetition if at this point it was not used to mean 
something different. And in addition to this, that which comes next - 'and I will establish My covenant with you - is also a statement that has appeared already. From this it is clear that 'those going 
out of the ark' means people who have been regenerated, that is, members of the Church, and 'wild animal of the earth' all people throughout the world who are outside of the Church. </p>

 Except 
when used to mean a living creature, 'wild animal of the earth' in the Word means things of a more inferior kind which to a greater or less extent are of an untamed nature, their exact meaning depending 
on the things to which they refer. When referring to the things that are within man, 'wild animal of the earth' means the lower things that belong to the external man and to the body, such as those 
just mentioned in this verse, and so things of a more inferior kind. When it refers to an entire community, which is called a composite man, or composite person, 'wild animal of the earth' means people 
who do not belong to the Church because they are more inferior. And the meaning may be different again depending on the subject to which it refers, as in Hosea, </p>

'Ab omnibus egredientibus ex arca': quod significet homines Ecclesiae, et 'quoad omnem feram terrae' quod significet hominem extra Ecclesiam, constare potest a serie rerum in sensu interno, nam prius 
nominata sunt omnia quae egressa sunt ex arca ut omnis anima viva quoad avem, bestiam, et feram terrae, hic iterum dicitur 'ab omnibus egredientibus ex arca quoad feram terrae,' ita fera terrae altera 
vice nominatur, quae repetitio non foret nisi aliud quid hic intelligebatur; tum etiam sequitur 'et erigo foedus Meum vobiscum,' quod prius etiam dictum; inde constat quod per 'egredientes ex arca' 
significentur regenerati seu homines Ecclesiae, et per 'feram terrae' omnes in universo qui extra Ecclesiam: [2] fera terrae in Verba significat, quando per illam viva non intelligantur, illa quae viliora 
sunt et plus aut minus ex ferina natura trahunt, et hoc praedicate ad ea de quibus agitur; cum de iis quae in homine, tunc 'fera terrae' significat inferiora quae externi hominis et quae corporis 
sunt, ut mox prius in hoc versu, ita viliora; cum de integra societate, quae homo compositus seu persona composita vocatur, tunc 'fera terrae' significat eos qui non Ecclesiae sunt quia viliores; et 
sic porro praedicate ad id quod est subjectum: ut apud Hosheam, 	Feriam illis foedus in die illo cum fera agri, et cum ave caelorum, et reptili terrae, ii 18: </p>
<p>apud Esaiam, 	Honorabit Me fera agri, 
quia dedi in deserto aquas, xliii 20: </p>
<p>apud Ezechielem, 	In ramis illius nidificarunt omnis avis caelorum, et sub ramis illius genuerunt omnis fera agri, ac in umbra illius habitaverunt omnes gentes 
magnae, xxxi 6. </p>
