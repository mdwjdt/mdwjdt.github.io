<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8858节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8858.</strong>一个人的整个人品取决于他生活的指导原则；他凭这个原则而有别于其他人。若他是良善的，他的天堂便照这良善而形成；若他是邪恶的，他的地狱便照这邪恶而形成。因为它构成他真实的意愿，因而构成他生命的真实存在，死后无法改变。由此可见一个重生之人的生命是何性质，一个未重生之人的生命又是何性质。</p>

A man is wholly such as is the ruling principle of his life; by this he is distinguished from others; according to this is formed his heaven if he is good, and his hell if he is evil; for it is his veriest 
will, and thus the very being of his life, which cannot be changed after death. From all this it is evident what is the nature of the life of one who is regenerate, and what is the nature of the 
life of one who is not regenerate.            EXODUS 20 </p>
<p>     1. And God spake all these words, saying,       2. I am Jehovah thy God, who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the 
house of servants.      3. Thou shalt have no other gods before My faces.      4. Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, nor any likeness, of that which is in the heavens above, or that which 
is in the earth beneath, or that which is in the waters under the earth: </p>
<p>     5. Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them; for I Jehovah thy God am a zealous God, visiting the iniquity 
of the fathers upon the sons, upon the thirds and upon the fourths of them that hate Me: </p>
<p>     6. And doing mercy to thousands of them that love Me and keep My commandments.      7. Thou shalt not 
take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain; for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain.      8. Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.      9. Six days shalt thou labor, 
and do all thy work: </p>
<p>     10. And the seventh day is the Sabbath to Jehovah thy God; thou shalt not do any work, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and thy beast, 
and thy sojourner who is in thy gates: </p>
<p>     11. For in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested in the seventh day; wherefore Jehovah blessed the Sabbath 
day, and hallowed it.      12. Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be prolonged upon the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee.      13.* Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not commit 
adultery. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not answer against thy neighbor the witness of a lie.      14. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, and his 
manservant, and his maidservant, and his ox, and his ass, and anything that is thy neighbor's.      15. And all the people saw the voices, and the torches, and the voice of the trumpet, and the mountain 
smoking; and the people saw, and they quaked, and stood afar off.      16. And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear; and let not God speak with us, lest perchance we die.  
    17. And Moses said unto the people, Fear not; because God is come to tempt you, and that the fear of Him may be before your faces, that ye sin not.      18. And the people stood afar off, and 
Moses came near unto the thick darkness where God was.      19. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the sons of Israel, Ye have seen that I have spoken with you from heaven.      20. 
Ye shall not make with Me gods of silver and gods of gold, ye shall not make unto you.      21. An altar of ground thou shalt make to Me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt-offerings, and thy thank-offerings, 
thy flocks, and thy herds; in every place where I shall put the memory of My name, I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.      22. And if thou make Me an altar of stones, thou 
shalt not build it of hewn stones; for if thou move thy tool upon it, thou wilt profane it.      23. And thou shalt not go up on steps unto Mine altar, that thy nakedness be not uncovered upon it. * 
The numbering here followed by Swedenborg from the Hebrew and Latin Bible of Schmidius, includes in verse 13, verses 14, 15, and 16 of our English version. [Reviser.] </p>

A person's whole character is determined by the nature of whatever dominates his life; this is what marks him off from others. His heaven is formed in accordance with it if he is good, or his hell if 
he is bad. For it constitutes his true will and so the true being of his life, which is unchangeable after death. From all this one may see what the life is like in a person who has been regenerated, 
and what it is like in one who has not been regenerated. </p>

Homo prorsus talis est, quale est ejus vitae dominans; per hoc distinguitur ab aliis; secundum hoc fit ejus caelum si bonus est, ac fit ejus infernum si malus, nam id est ipsissima ejus voluntas, et 
sic ipsum esse vitae ejus, quod post mortem mutari non potest. Ex his patet quale vitae est regenerato, et quale vitae est non regenerato. </p>
<p>EXODUS {1}CAPUT @1 i EXODI AIT$  </p>
<p>1.  Et locutus est 
DEUS omnia verba haec, dicendo, </p>
<p>2.  Ego JEHOVAH DEUS tuus, Qui eduxi te e terra Aegypti, e domo servorum. </p>
<p>3.  Non erit tibi dii alii coram faciebus Meis. </p>
<p>4.  Non facies tibi sculptile, et ullam 
similitudinem quae in caelis desuper, et quae in terra desuper, et quae in aquis de sub terra. </p>
<p>5.  Non incurvabis te illis, et non servies illis, quia Ego JEHOVAH DEUS tuus, DEUS {1} zelotes, visitans 
iniquitatem patrum super filios, super tertios et super quartos, osoribus Meis. @1 i (in singular)$  </p>
<p>6.  Et faciens misericordiam ad millenos amantibus Me, et custodientibus praecepta Mea. </p>
<p>7. 
 Non feres nomen JEHOVAE DEI tui {1}ad vanum, quia non innocentem reddet JEHOVAH illum qui fert nomen Ipsius ad vanum. @1 d in vanum i ad vanum$  </p>
<p>8.  Recordare diei sabbati ad sanctificandum 
eum. </p>
<p>9.  Sex diebus laborabis, et facies omne opus tuum. </p>
<p>10.  Et dies septimus sabbatum JEHOVAH DEO tuo, non facies ullum opus tu, et filius tuus, et filia tua, servus tuus, et ancilla tua, et 
bestia tua, et peregrinus tuus qui in portis tuis. </p>
<p>11.  Quia sex diebus fecit JEHOVAH caelum et terram, mare, et omne quod in illis, et quievit in die septimo; idcirco benedixit JEHOVAH diei sabbati, 
et sanctificavit eum. </p>
<p>12.  Honora patrem tuum et matrem tuam, propterea ut prolongentur dies tui super terra quam JEHOVAH DEUS tuus dat tibi. </p>
<p>{1}13.  Non occides.  Non adulterabis.  Non furaberis. 
 Non respondebis in proximum tuum testis mendacii. @1 In Heb Bible and in AV this verse and verses 14-23 are numbered 13-16 and 17-26 respectively.  S's enumeration is the same as that of Sch.$ 
 </p>
<p>14.  Non concupisces domum proximi tui; non concupisces uxorem proximi tui, et servum ejus et ancillam ejus, et bovem ejus et asinum ejus, et omne quod proximo tuo. </p>
<p>15.  Et omnis populus videntes 
voces et faces, et vocem buccinae, et montem fumantem; et vidit populus, et commoti sunt, et steterunt e longinquo. </p>
<p>16.  Et dixerunt ad Moschen, Loquere tu cum nobis, et audiemus, et ne loquatur 
cum nobis DEUS, ne forte moriamur. </p>
<p>17.  Et dixit Moscheh ad populum, Ne timeatis, quia propterea ut tentare vos, venit DEUS, et propterea ut sit timor Ipsius coram faciebus vestris, ut non peccetis. </p>
<p>18. 
 Et stetit populus e longinquo, et Moscheh accessit ad caliginem ubi DEUS. </p>
<p>19.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Moschen, Ita dices ad filios Israelis, Vos vidistis quod e caelo locutus sim cum vobis. </p>
<p>20. 
 Non facietis cum Me deos argenti et deos auri, non facietis vobis. </p>
<p>21.  Altare humi facies Mihi, et sacrificabis super illo holocausta tua et eucharistica tua, greges tuos, et armenta tua; 
in omni loco quo memoriam posuero nominis Mei, veniam ad te et benedicam tibi. </p>
<p>22.  Et si altare lapidum facias Mihi, non aedificabis illos (x)caesos, quia si caelum tuum moveris super illo, et profanabis 
illud. </p>
<p>23.  Et non ascendes in gradibus super ad altare Meum, ut non reveletur nuditas tua super illo. </p>
