<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7810节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7810.</strong>还有一次，一个惩罚灵来到我这里，和前一个灵人一样，将自己安置在我身体中间之下的左侧，还想惩罚我。但他被他们的天使赶走了，那时这些天使也在场。当时他向我演示了如果他们星球的成员行恶，或企图行恶，他们被允许施加给这些人的惩罚种类。除了关节的疼痛外，腹部中间周围也有一种疼痛的收缩，这种疼痛的收缩感觉像是被一条尖腰带勒紧一样。接着他们反复限制呼吸，直到他们感觉窒息为止；还有就是除了面包外，禁止吃任何东西。最后，如果他们不放弃他们所做的事，死亡的威胁就笼罩着他们，这会剥夺他们从妻儿和同伴那里所享受的欢乐。他们同时也会感受到随之而来的悲痛。</p>

At another time also a chastising spirit came to me, and applied himself to my left side below the middle of the body, as before, and also desired to punish me; but he was driven away by their angels, 
who likewise were present. He then showed me the kinds of punishments which they are permitted to inflict on the men of their earth if they do evil and intend to do evil. Besides a pain in the joints, 
there was a painful contraction around the middle of the belly, which is felt like a compression by a sharp girdle; there was alternate withdrawal of the respiration, even to distress; also a prohibition 
against eating anything but bread; lastly, a denunciation of death if they did not leave off doing such things; and at the same time a deprivation of the joy from consort, children, and companions, 
resulting in the instilling of grief. </p>

At another time a chastiser spirit came towards me and placed himself by my left side below the middle of my body, like the previous one, and also wished to administer punishment. But he was withheld 
from doing so by their angels, who were also present at that time. He showed me then the kinds of punishments that they were allowed to inflict on members of their own planet if they behaved badly or 
intended to do so. Besides the infliction of pain in their joints there was also that of painful constriction round their waist, which feels like being squeezed by a tight belt. Then there was repeated 
restriction of their breathing till they felt that they were suffocating, and also the denial of all food except bread. Finally if they did not give up doing the things they did, there hung over them 
the threat of death, which would deprive them of the joy of married partner, children, and companions. The consequent grief was brought home to them at the same time too. </p>

Alio tempore etiam venit ad me spiritus castigator, et applicuit se lateri meo sinistro infra medium corporis, ut prius, et quoque tunc voluit punire; sed {1}arcebatur ab angelis eorum qui etiam tunc 
aderant.  Ostendebat mihi {2} tunc punitionum genera quae illis permissa sunt inferre hominibus suae telluris, si male agunt {3}et male agere intendunt; erat, praeter dolorem artuum, etiam coarctatio 
dolorifica circa medium ventrem, quae sentitur sicut compressio a cingulo acuto; tum etiam erat respirationis sublatio per vices usque ad angustias; tum quoque inhibitio ne aliquid praeter panem ederent; 
demum denuntiatio mortis si similia facere non intermitterent, et tunc privatio gaudii ex conjuge, liberis, et sociis; dolor inde tunc quoque insinuatur. 	@1 impediebatur$ 	@2 i is$ 	@3 vel$ </p>
