<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第366节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>366.</strong>创世记4:8 该隐与他兄弟亚伯说话，二人正在田间；该隐起来打他兄弟亚伯，把他杀了。<br />“该隐与他兄弟亚伯说话”表一段时间。如前所述，“该隐”仍表从爱分离之信；“亚伯”表仁，信的兄弟，鉴于此，他在这一节中两次被称为“他兄弟”；“田”表构成教义的一切；“该隐起来打他兄弟亚伯，把他杀了”表分离之信灭了仁。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]366.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_366/bible_king-james-version_genesis_4_8" target=_top>Genesis 4:8</a>. And Cain said to Abel his brother ... And it happened when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him.<br />Cain said to Abel means a length of time. Cain, as I said [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_366/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_337#subsection-2-3" target=_top>337:3</a>], symbolizes faith separated from love. Abel symbolizes charity, the brother of faith, which is why he is called brother twice here. The field symbolizes every point of doctrine. Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him means that a detached faith extinguished charity. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 366</b></p><p><b>366.</b>
Verse 8. And Cain spake to Abel his brother; and it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him. "Cain spake to Abel" signifies an interval of time. 
"Cain" as before stated, signifies faith separated from love; and "Abel" charity, the brother of faith, on which account he is here twice called his "brother." A "field" signifies whatever is of 
doctrine. "Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him" signifies that separated faith extinguished charity. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 366</b></p><p><b>366.</b>
Verse 8 And Cain spoke to Abel his brother. And when they were in the field Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him. 'Cain spoke to Abel' means a passage of time. 'Cain', as has been stated, 
means faith separated from love, and 'Abel' means charity, the brother of faith, which is why he is twice called 'brother' in this verse. 'Field' means all that constitutes doctrine. 'Cain rose up 
against Abel his brother and killed him' means that separated faith annihilated charity.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 366</b>
</p><b>366.</b>
Vers. 8.  Et dixit Cain ad Habel, fratrem suum: et erat, cum essent in agro, et surrexit Cain contra Habel fratrem tuum, et occidit illum. 'Quod dixerit Cain ad Habel' significat tractum temporis; per 
'Cain' significatur, ut dictum, fides separata ab amore; per 'Habel' charitas, quae est frater fidei, quare etiam hic bis vocatur frater: 'ager' significat quicquid est doctrinae: 'quod surrexerit 
Cain contra Habel fratrem suum, et occiderit illum' significat quod fides separata exstinxerit charitatem. </p>
