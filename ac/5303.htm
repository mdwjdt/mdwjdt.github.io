Verses 37-40. And the word was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants. And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Shall we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the spirit of God? 
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath caused thee to know all this, there is no one so intelligent and wise as thou; thou shalt be over my house, and upon thy mouth shall all my people 
kiss; only in the throne will I be greater than thou. "And the word was good in the eyes of Pharaoh," signifies what is very pleasing to the natural; "and in the eyes of all his servants," signifies 
what is very pleasing to all things in the natural; "and Pharaoh said unto his servants," signifies the perception of the natural together with all things therein; "Shall we find such a one as this, 
a man in whom is the spirit of God," signifies about the influx of truth in which is good from the interior, thus the celestial of the spiritual; "and Pharaoh said unto Joseph," signifies the perception 
of the natural from the celestial of the spiritual; "Forasmuch as God hath caused thee to know all this," signifies because it has foresight and providence; "there is no one so intelligent and wise 
as thou," signifies that this is the only source of truth and good; "thou shalt be over my house," signifies that the natural mind shall be subordinate and submissive thereto; "and upon thy mouth shall 
all my people kiss," signifies that everything therein shall be in obedience to him; "only in the throne will I be greater than thou," signifies that nevertheless it will appear as if from the natural, 
because from the celestial of the spiritual through the natural. </p>

Verses 37-40 And the thing was good in Pharaoh's eyes and in the eyes of all his servants. And Pharaoh said to his servants, Shall we find a man like this, in whom is the spirit of God? And Pharaoh said 
to Joseph, After God has caused you to know all this, no one has intelligence and wisdom like you. You shall be over my house, and all my people shall kiss you on the mouth; only in the throne will 
I be great, more than you. </p>
<p>'And the thing was good in Pharaoh's eyes' means that the natural was well-pleased. 'And in the eyes of all his servants' means that everything in the natural was well-pleased. 
'And Pharaoh said to his servants' means the perception of the natural and of everything in it. 'Shall we find a man like this, in whom is the spirit of God?' means regarding an influx of truth 
containing good received from within, and so containing the celestial of the spiritual. 'And Pharaoh said to Joseph' means a perception present in the natural but received from the celestial of the 
spiritual. 'After God has caused you to know all this' means for the reason that Foresight and Providence belong to that celestial of the spiritual. 'No one has intelligence and wisdom like you' means 
that this alone is the source of truth and good. 'You shall be over my house' means that the natural mind shall be made subordinate and submissive to it. 'And all my people shall kiss you on the mouth' 
means that everything there shall obey it. 'Only in the throne will I be great, more than you' means that the natural will be seen as sovereign, because the celestial of the spiritual acts through 
the natural. </p>

Vers. 37-40. Et bonum fuit {1}verbum in oculis Pharaonis, et in oculis omnium servorum illius. Et dixit Pharaoh ad servos suos, Num inveniemus sicut hunc virum, in quo spiritus Dei? Et dixit Pharaoh 
ad Josephum, Postquam cognoscere fecit Deus tibimet omne hoc, nemo intelligens et sapiens sicut tu. Tu eris super domo mea, et super ore tuo osculabitur omnis populus meus, tantum solio magnus ero prae 
te. `Et bonum fuit verbum in oculis Pharaonis' significat complacentiam naturalis: `et in oculis omnium servorum illius' significat complacentiam omnibus in naturali: `et dixit Pharaoh ad servos suos' 
significat perceptionem naturalis cum omnibus ibi: `Num inveniemus sicut hunc virum, in quo spiritus Dei?' significat de influxu veri in quo bonum ab interiore, ita caeleste spiritualis: `et dixit 
Pharaoh ad Josephum' significat perceptionem naturalis e caelesti spiritualis: `Postquam cognoscere fecit Deus tibimet omne hoc' significat quia Praevidentia et Providentia illi: `nemo intelligens et 
sapiens sicut tu' significat quod inde solum verum et bonum: `tu eris super domo mea' significat quod ei mens naturalis subordinata et submissa erit: `et super ore tuo osculabitur omnis populus meus' 
significat quod omne ibi sub oboedientia illius erit: `tantum solio magnus ero prae te' significat quod apparebit usque sicut e naturali, quia a caelesti spiritualis per illud.   @1 A here o verbum$ </p>
