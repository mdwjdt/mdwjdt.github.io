<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1337节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1337.</strong>没有必要证实所表示的是这些事物，这从前面所给出的同样这些话的含义清楚可知。只需在此说明，该教会的内在敬拜仅仅是一种知识，因而是一种爱，这爱可被称为真理之爱。因为该教会最初时几乎没有任何仁爱存留，因而几乎没有任何信存留，因为信唯独从仁而来。这也可从有关巴别城和塔的论述看出来，“因为耶和华变乱了全地的口音”（11:9）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1337.</strong> There is no need to prove this symbolism. It is evident from the symbolism of the same items as discussed earlier.{*1} All that needs to be said is that internal worship in this church was merely an intellectual exercise. So it was an exercise of the love that can be called a love of truth, because at the start of this church hardly any charity was left. Consequently not much faith — which comes only from charity — remained either. This follows logically from explanations just above about the city and tower of Babel and specifically the fact that Jehovah muddled the language of the whole earth (verse 9).{*2} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The meaning of Shem as internal worship in general rather than the inner church (its earlier meaning) is mentioned above at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1337/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1330" target=_top>1330-1331</a>. "One hundred years" is touched on at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1337/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1332" target=_top>1332</a>. Arpachshad is dealt with briefly at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1337/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1334" target=_top>1334</a>, which also contains a cross-reference. Fathering sons and daughters is explained, also briefly, just below in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1337/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1338" target=_top>1338</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1337/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1346" target=_top>1346</a>.

That these things are signified, calls for no confirmation, being evident from the signification of the same words as given above. I shall merely state that the internal worship of this church was no 
other than a kind of memory-knowledge [scientficum], thus a kind of love which may be called a love of truth. For when this church began, there was scarcely any charity left, and therefore scarcely any 
faith, which comes solely from charity; as also is evident from what was said just before concerning the city and the tower of Babel, in that Jehovah did confound the lip of all the earth (verse 9). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1337</b></p><p><b>1337.</b>
There is no need to confirm that these things are meant as it is clear from the meaning of the same words when used previously. Only this need be said, that the internal worship of this Church was merely 
a kind of factual knowledge, and so a kind of love which can be called the love of truth. For when this Church first began, scarcely any charity remained, and thus scarcely any faith, which does 
not exist at all without charity. This too is clear from what has been stated above concerning the city and tower of Babel, that 'Jehovah confounded the lip of the whole earth', verse 9. </p>

</p><b>1337.</b>
Quod haec significentur, non opus est confirmare; constat ex significatione eorundem de qua prius:  solum quod internus cultus hujus Ecclesiae non aliud fuerit quam quoddam scientificum, ita quoddam 
amoris qui vocari potest amor veri; cum enim haec Ecclesia incepit, vix aliqua charitas residua fuit, ita nec fides, quae solius charitatis; ut quoque a mox praecedentibus constat de urbe et turri Babelis 
quod nempe 'Jehovah confudit labium totius terrae,' vers. 9. </p>
