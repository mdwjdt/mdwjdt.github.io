<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第150节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>150.</strong>当人活在自我当中，以为他是凭自己而活，就被比作“沉睡”。事实上，古人就是称之为“沉睡”。圣经论到此等人，说“耶和华将沉睡的灵浇灌他们”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛29.10.htm">29:10</a>），或说“他们睡了长觉”（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.57.htm">51:57</a>）。<br />对于人的自我本是死的，没有人是凭自己而活，这在精灵界是如此明显，以致那些以自我为中心、坚称是凭自己而活的恶灵，也因着显着的体验，不得不承认他们并非凭自己而活。多年以来，我以一种特殊的方式体验着自我的本质，清楚地觉察到我凭自己根本不能思想。我思维中的每个念头，其实都是从外流入的，有时我甚至能觉察它是怎样流入又是从哪流入的。因此，以为凭自己而活的人是处于幻相当中，且将罪恶和错误归于自身。要是他能相信事实真相，就不致这样了。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]150.</strong> Our condition when we rely on ourselves or when we think we live by our own power can be compared to slumber or unconsciousness. The people of old actually called that condition slumber, and the Word speaks of it as "being flooded with a spirit of slumber" [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_150/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_29_10" target=_top>Isaiah 29:10</a>] and "sleeping a sleep" [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_150/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_51_39" target=_top>Jeremiah 51:39</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_150/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_51_57" target=_top>57</a>].<br />The truth that human selfhood is inherently dead, that none of us have any life on our own, is demonstrated in the world of spirits by vivid experience — so vivid that evil spirits, who love nothing but selfhood or a sense of autonomy and obstinately insist that they live independently, become convinced and admit that life is not theirs after all.<br />I more than any other have been given the opportunity in the last several years to see what "human autonomy" amounts to, finding as I have that not a single one of my thoughts originated in me. I have been able to perceive with utmost clarity that every component idea in my thinking has come from outside, and sometimes I have seen where it came from and how it entered.<br />Therefore those who suppose they live by their own power have it wrong. By believing that they live independently, they adopt all possible evil and falsity as their own, and this they would never do if they believed the situation to be as it really is. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 150</b></p><p><b>150.</b>
The state of man when in his Own, or when he supposes that he lives from himself, is compared to "deep sleep" and indeed by the ancients was called deep sleep; and in the Word it is said of such that 
they have "poured out upon them the spirit of deep sleep" (Isa. 29:10), and that they sleep a sleep (Jer. 51:57). That man's Own is in itself dead, and that no one has any life from himself, has been 
shown so clearly in the world of spirits, that evil spirits who love nothing but their Own, and obstinately insist that they live from themselves, were convinced by sensible experience, and were forced 
to confess that they do not live from themselves. For a number of years I have been permitted in an especial manner to know how the case is with what is man's own, and it has been granted to me to 
perceive clearly that I could think nothing from myself, but that every idea of thought flows in, and sometimes I could perceive how and whence it flowed in. The man who supposes that he lives from himself 
is therefore in what is false, and by believing that he lives from himself appropriates to himself everything evil and false, which he would never do if his belief were in accordance with the real 
truth of the case. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 150</b></p><p><b>150.</b>
The state of a person when caught up in the proprium, that is, when he imagines that he lives from himself, is compared to a deep sleep. Indeed the ancients actually called it 'a deep sleep' while the 
Word speaks of people having 'the spirit of deep sleep poured out on them,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and of their sleeping a perpetual sleep.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> The fact that man's proprium is in itself dead, that is, that nobody possesses 
any life from himself, has been demonstrated in the world of spirits so completely that evil spirits who love nothing except the proprium, and insist stubbornly that they do live from themselves, have 
been convinced by means of living experience, and have admitted that they do not live from themselves. With regard to the human proprium I have for several years now been given a unique opportunity to 
know about it - in particular that not a trace of my thinking began in myself. I have also been allowed to perceive clearly that every idea constituting my thought flowed in [from somewhere], and sometimes 
how it flowed in, and where from. Consequently anyone who imagines that he lives from himself is in error. And in believing that he does live from himself he takes to himself everything evil and 
false, which he would never do if what he believed and what is actually the case were in agreement.

</p><b>150.</b>
Status hominis cum est in proprio, seu cum putat vivere ex se, comparatus est sopori, immo ab antiquis dictus sopor, in Verbo quod perfundantur spiritu soporis, ac dormitent somnum. Quod proprium hominis 
in se mortuum sit, seu quod nullus aliquam vitam habeat ex se, ostensum est in mundo spirituum, usque adeo ut mali spiritus, qui nihil nisi proprium amant et se ex semet vivere contumaciter instant, 
per vivas experientias convicti, et fassi quod non vivant ex se. Quomodo se habeat cum proprio hominis, scire prae aliis mihi datum est nunc intra aliquot annorum tempus; quod nempe ne hilum cogitaverim 
ex memet; et manifeste percipere datum quod unaquaevis idea cogitationis influeret, et quandoque quomodo et unde influeret. Quare homo qui putat se vivere ex se, in falso est; et per id quod credit 
se vivere ex se, appropriat sibi omne malum et falsum, quod nusquam sibi appropriaret, si sicut res se habet, crederet. </p>
