<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1255节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1255.</strong>“各随他们的出生”表各随他们能被改造的程度。这从“出生”的含义明显可知，“出生”就是改造。当人被主再生，或重生时，他重新接受的每一个事物都是出生或诞生。所以，由于此处论述的主题是古教会，故出生表各随他们能被改造的程度。至于这些民族的改造，他们的敬拜不都一样，他们的教义也不都一样，因为他们的性情不都一样，从小受到的教育和教导也不都一样。主绝不破碎人从小就吸收的定见，而是矫正它们。若这些定见是此人视之为圣的事物，并且不是诸如违背神性和属世秩序的那一种，而是本身无关紧要，主就会由它们去，允许它们归于这人。主对这第二代古教会所做的很多事就是这样。对此，蒙主怜悯，容后再述。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1255.</strong> The fact that by their births means insofar as they were able to reform can be seen from the symbolism of birth as reformation. When we are being reborn or regenerated by the Lord, each and every new thing that we receive is a birth. So in this case, since the ancient church is under discussion, the births mean insofar as its people were able to reform.<br />With regard to reformation of the nations, they did not all have the same kind of worship or the same teachings, because they did not all have the same disposition or the same upbringing and education from childhood on. The Lord never breaks the principles we first adopt as children but bends them. Any principles we possess that we have always invested with holiness, any that do not inherently oppose God's plan or the order of the physical world but are inconsequential, those principles the Lord leaves alone and allows to remain in us. This was true of many principles that the second ancient church adopted, which will be discussed below [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1255/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1337" target=_top>1337</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1255/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1343" target=_top>1343</a>], by the Lord's divine mercy. </p>

According to their nativities. That this signifies in proportion as they could be reformed, is evident from the signification of a "nativity," as being reformation. While a man is being born again, or 
regenerated, by the Lord, each and all things that he receives anew are nativities or births. So here, as the subject is the Ancient Church, the nativities signify in proportion as they could be reformed. 
As regards the reformations of the nations, they were not all in the same worship, nor in the same doctrine, for the reason that they were not all of the same genius, and were not all similarly 
educated and instructed from infancy. The principles which a man imbibes from infancy the Lord never breaks, but bends. If they are things that the man esteems holy, and are such as are not contrary 
to Divine and natural order, but are in themselves matters of indifference, the Lord lets them alone, and suffers the man to remain in them. So it was with many things in the second Ancient Church, concerning 
which of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1255</b></p><p><b>1255.</b>
That 'according to their generations' means insofar as they were capable of being reformed is clear from the meaning of 'a generation' as reformation. When someone is born again or regenerated by the 
Lord, every single thing he receives anew is in that case a generation. So also here, since the Ancient Church is the subject, 'generations' means insofar as they were capable of being reformed. As for 
the reformations of these nations, the latter did not all have the same form of worship, nor did they all have the same doctrine, the reasons being that they were not all of the same disposition, and 
had not all been brought up in the same ways and from early childhood been taught the same things. The Lord in no way destroys the basic attitudes a person acquires from early childhood, but modifies 
them. And if these are held sacred by the person and are such as do not stand contrary to Divine and natural order but are in themselves of little importance, the Lord lets them alone and allows them 
to remain with that person, as He did with many things in the second Ancient Church, which things will in the Lord's Divine mercy be dealt with later on. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1255</b>
</p><b>1255.</b>
'Secundum nativitates eorum':  quod significent sicut reformari potuerint, constat a significatione 'nativitatis' quod sit reformatio; cum homo renascitur seu regeneratur a Domino, tunc omnia et singula 
quae e novo accipit, sunt 'nativitates'; ita hic, nativitates quia de Antiqua Ecclesia agitur, significant sicut reformari potuerint:  quod reformationes gentium attinet, non omnes simili cultu fuerunt 
nec simili doctrina, ex causa quia non omnes simili genio {1}fuerunt, et quia non omnes similiter educati et similiter ab infantia instructi; principia quae homo ab infantia capit, Dominus nusquam 
frangit sed flectit; si quae sunt in quibus sanctitatem posuit et talia sunt quae non contra ordinem Divinum et naturalem sed in se adiaphora, illa Dominus relinquit, et patitur ut in iis maneat; 
sicut plura in Antiqua Ecclesia altera, de quibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus. @1 Fuerant I.$ </p>
