CHAPTER 8. CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE HELLS. HERE CONCERNING THE HELLS OF THOSE WHO HAVE PASSED THEIR LIVES IN ADULTERIES AND LASCIVIOUSNESS. ALSO CONCERNING THE HELLS OF THE DECEITFUL, AND OF SORCERESSES. Beneath 
the heel of the right foot* is a hell inhabited by those who have delighted in cruelty and at the same time in adulteries, and have felt in them the greatest delight of their lives. 
It is remarkable that those who have been cruel in the life of the body have been also, more than others, adulterers. Such are those who are in this hell, where they practice unspeakable methods of cruelty. 
By their phantasies they make themselves vessels as for braying, like those used for braying herbs, and pestles, wherewith they bray** and torture whomsoever they can; and also as it were broad 
axes, like those of executioners; and augers, with which they do cruel violence to one another; not to mention other direful cruelties. Some of the Jews are there who in former times so cruelly treated 
the Gentiles. And at this day that hell is increasing, especially from those who come from the so-called Christian world and have had all the delight of their life in adulteries, who also are for 
the most part cruel. Sometimes their delight is turned into the stench of human excrement, which exhales excessively when that hell is opened. I perceived it in the world of spirits, and at the time almost 
fell into a swoon from the effect of it. This noisome, excrementitious smell by turns fills the hell, and by turns ceases; for it is their delight from adulteries which is turned into such offensiveness. 
In process of time, when they have passed through a given period in such things, they are left alone and sit in torment, becoming like unsightly skeletons, but still living. *  The author speaks 
of places in the spiritual world as being situated in accordance with their correspondence to the human body. [Reviser.] **  See Prov. 27:22; 2 Sam. 12:31; and Spiritual Experiences 2639. </p>

<p>THE HELLS - continued Here, the hells of people who have gone through life committing adultery and acts of unrestrained lust; also the hells of deceivers and witches. </p>
<p>Beneath the heel of the 
right foot there is a hell where there are people who have taken delight in being cruel and at the same time in committing adultery. They have felt in such behaviour the chief joy in their lives. It 
is a surprising fact that people who have been cruel during their lifetime have also been the worst adulterers. Such is the nature of the people who inhabit that hell. There they carry out acts of cruelty 
by unmentionable methods. By means of their delusions they make vessels for themselves resembling those in which herbs are crushed to bits, and also crushing instruments, with which they crush and 
torment whomever they can. They also so to speak make broad axes for themselves, like those used by executioners, and drilling tools as well, which they use mercilessly on one another, in addition to 
other dreadful acts of cruelty. In that place are some of the Jews who in the past treated gentiles in this cruel fashion. And today this hell is growing, chiefly from persons who belong to the so-called 
Christian world and who have found all the joy of life in committing adultery, and who too are for the most part cruel people. Sometimes their joy is converted into the stench of human excrement 
which is given off voluminously when this hell is opened up. I have smelt it in the world of spirits and have collapsed practically unconscious as a result of it. That foul stink of excrement by turns 
invades hell and then leaves off. It is the joy they take in committing adultery which is converted into so foul a stink. In the process of time, having spent a definite period of time with such things, 
they are left all alone, living in torment and becoming like hideous skeletons, though they are still living. </p>

GENESEOS CAPUT OCTAVUM  Continuatio de Infernis </p>
<p>HIC de Infernis eorum qui in Adulteriis et Lasciviis vitam transegerunt: tum de Infernis Dolosorum et Praestigiatricium </p>
<p>SUB calcaneo pedis dextri 
est infernum ubi ii qui delectati sunt crudelitate et simul adulteriis, et in iis jucundissimum suae vitae perceperunt: mirum, quod qui in corporis vita crudeles fuerunt, etiam prae aliis adulteri 
fuerunt; qui tales, in illo inferno sunt: ibi crudelitates exercent infandis modis; vasa sibi per phantasias faciunt, quasi trituratoria sicut quae sunt olerum, et instrumenta trituratoria, quibus sic 
triturant et cruciant quos possunt; tum etiam quasi secures latas sicut carnificum, ut et terebras, quibus crudeliter unus alterum tractat, praeter alia dira.  Ibi sunt aliqui ex Judaeis, qui ita olim 
crudeliter tractarunt gentes; et hodie infernum hoc crescit, cumprimis ab illis qui sunt ex orbe ita vocato Christiano et in adulteriis omnem vitae suae jucunditatem habuerunt, qui ut plurimum quoque 
crudeles sunt.  Quandoque jucunditas eorum vertitur in fetorem stercoris humani, qui, cum infernum hoc aperitur, (x)affatim exhalat; sentitus in mundo spirituum et tunc fere in deliquium inde lapsus 
sum; graveolentia ista stercorea per vices occupat infernum et per vices cessat; est jucundum eorum ex adulteriis quod in talem graveolentiam vertitur. Successu temporis, quando aetatem in talibus transegerunt, 
relinquuntur solitarii, et sedent in cruciatu, et fiunt sicut sceleta deformia, sed usque vivunt. </p>
