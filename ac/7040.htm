<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7040.</strong>出埃及记4:24-26.在路上，在客栈的时候，耶和华遇见他，想要杀他。西坡拉就拿一块火石，割下她儿子的阳皮，使它接触他的脚；说，你真是我的血新郎了。这样耶和华才放了他。那时，她说，你因割礼就是血的新郎了。<br />“在路上，在客栈的时候”表雅各的后代处于没有一个内在的外在。“耶和华遇见他”表反对。“想要杀他”表无法在这些后代中间建立一个代表性教会。“西坡拉就拿一块火石”表代表性教会通过真理所展示的真实性质。“割下她儿子的阳皮”表除去各种污秽的爱，由此使内在露出来。“使它接触他的脚”表那时属世层的真实性质被展示出来。“说，你真是我的血新郎了”表它充满对真理和良善的各种暴力和敌意。“这样耶和华才放了他”表他们被允许成为代表。“那时，她说，你因割礼就是血的新郎了”表尽管内在充满对真理和良善的各种暴力和敌意，但割礼仍作为代表从各种污秽的爱中洁净的标志而被接受。</p>

Verses 24-26. And it came to pass in the way, in the inn, that Jehovah met him, and sought to kill him. And Zipporah took a stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and made it touch his feet; and 
she said, Because a bridegroom of bloods art thou to me. And He ceased from him. Then she said, A bridegroom of bloods as to circumcisions. "And it came to pass in the way, in the inn," signifies that 
the posterity of Jacob were in externals without an internal; "that Jehovah met him," signifies opposition; "and sought to kill him," signifies that a representative church could not be instituted with 
that posterity; "and Zipporah took a stone," signifies the quality shown by the representative church by means of truth; "and cut off the foreskin of her son," signifies the removal of filthy loves, 
and thereby the laying bare of the internal; "and made it touch his feet," signifies that the quality of the natural was then shown; "and she said, Because a bridegroom of bloods art thou to me," signifies 
that it was full of all violence and hostility against truth and good; "and He ceased from him," signifies that it was permitted that they should represent; "then she said, A bridegroom of bloods 
as to circumcisions," signifies that although the internal was full of violence and hostility against truth and good, still circumcision was to be received as a sign representative of purification 
from filthy loves. </p>

Verses 24-26 And he was on the way in the lodging-place, and Jehovah came to meet him and sought to kill him. And Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and caused it to touch his 
feet, and said, Surely a bridegroom of blood<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> are you to me! And He ceased from him'. Then she said, A bridegroom of blood<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> in regard to circumcisions. 'And he was on the way in the lodging-place' means 
that the attention of the descendants of Jacob was focused on outward forms without their inner meaning. 'And Jehovah came to meet him<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> means opposition. 'And sought to kill him' means that a representative 
Church could not be established among those descendants. 'And Zipporah took a flint' means that the representative Church used truth to demonstrate the actual nature. 'And cut off the foreskin 
of her son' means the removal of filthy kinds of love, as a result of which the internal is laid bare. 'And caused it to touch his feet' means a demonstration of the actual nature of the natural 
then. 'And said, Surely a bridegroom of blood are you to me!' means that it was full of every kind of violence and hostility towards truth and goodness. 'And He ceased from him' means that they were 
allowed to be representative. 'Then she said, A bridegroom of blood in regard to circumcisions' means that although the internal was full of violence and hostility towards truth and goodness, circumcision 
was nevertheless accepted as a sign representative of purification from filthy kinds of love.

Vers. 24-26.  Et fuit in via in diversorio, et occurrit illi Jehovah, et quaesivit occidere illum.  Et accepit Zippora petram, et abscidit praeputium filii sui, et tangere fecit pedes ejus, et dixit, 
Quod sponsus sanguinum tu mihi.  Et cessavit ab illo; tunc dixit, Sponsus sanguinum ad circumcisiones.  `Et fuit in via in diversorio' significat posteritatem ex Jacobo quod in externis absque interno: 
`et occurrit illi Jehovah' significat oppositionem: `et quaesivit occidere illum' significat quod apud illam {1}Ecclesia repraesentativa non institui posset: `et accepit Zippora petram' significat 
quale ostensum ab Ecclesia repraesentativa per verum: `et abscidit praeputium filii sui' significat remotionem amorum spurcorum (c)et per id nudationem interni: `et tangere fecit pedes ejus' significat
