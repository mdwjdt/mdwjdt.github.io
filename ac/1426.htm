<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1426节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1426.</strong>如前所述，“亚伯兰”代表主的人性本质。这从有关亚伯兰的所有论述清楚可知。后来，亚伯兰既代表主的人性本质，也代表主的神性本质，那时，他叫做“亚伯拉罕”。从第一节到本节所讲述的事代表和表示主的最初意识，即祂要披上属天、因而神性之物。从此处开始，祂的人性本质要向祂的神性本质靠近。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1426.</strong> The representation of Abram as the Lord's human quality can be seen from details describing Abram [搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1426/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1401" target=_top>1401</a>]. Later on he represents both the human and the divine quality of the Lord, but at that point he is called Abraham.<br />From the first verse to the present one, the contents represent and symbolize the Lord's first realization that he would clothe himself in heavenly properties and so in divine ones. The steps his human quality took toward becoming divine start here. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1426</b></p><p><b>1426.</b>
That by "Abram" is represented the Lord as to His Human Essence, is evident from everything that is said of Abram. Afterwards he represents the Lord both as to the Human and also the Divine Essence, 
and he is then called "Abraham." The things that have so far been said, from the first verse, represent and signify the Lord's first mental advertence that He was to put on celestial and thus Divine things. 
Here there commence the progressions of His Human Essence to His Divine Essence. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1426</b></p><p><b>1426.</b>
That 'Abram' represents the Lord as regards His Human Essence is clear from all that has been said concerning Abram. Later on He represents Him both as regards the Human Essence and as regards the Divine 
Essence, though by then he is called Abraham. The things stated in verse I and down to the present verse represent and mean a first awareness that He was taking to Himself celestial and thus Divine 
things. Advances of His Human Essence closer to His Divine Essence begin here. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1426</b>
</p><b>1426.</b>
Quod per 'Abramum' repraesentetur Dominus quoad Humanam Ipsius Essentiam, constat a singulis quae de Abramo dicta sunt; postea, tam quoad Humanam quam quoad Divinam, at tunc appellatur Abraham.  Quae 
a versu primo ad hunc dicta sunt, repraesentant et significant primam animadvertentiam quod indueret caelestia et sic Divina:  hic progressiones Humanae Ipsius Essentiae ad Divinam incohant. </p>
