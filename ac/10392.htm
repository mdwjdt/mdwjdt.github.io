From this it can be seen what is meant by the Lord's words in Mark: </p>
<p>     He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be condemned (Mark 16:16); </p>
<p>"he that believeth" 
is he who acknowledges the Lord and receives Divine truths from Him through the Word; "he that is baptized" is he who is regenerated by the Lord by means of these truths.            EXODUS 32 </p>
<p> 
    1. And the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain; and the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Rise, make us gods which shall go before us; 
for as for this Moses, the man that made us come up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what hath become of him.      2. And Aaron said unto them, Tear off the golden earrings which are in the ears 
of your women, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.      3. And all the people tore off the golden earrings that were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.      4. And 
he received them from their hand, and formed it with a graving tool, and made it a molten calf; and they said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which made thee come up out of the land of Egypt.      5. 
And Aaron saw, and he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, Tomorrow is a feast to jehovah.*      6. And they rose up in the morning on the morrow, and offered burnt-offerings, 
and brought peace-offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.      7. And Jehovah spoke unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people have corrupted themselves, 
which thou madest to come up out of the land of Egypt; </p>
<p>     8. They have gone back suddenly from the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten calf, and have adored it, and have sacrificed 
to it, and said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which made thee to come up out of the land of Egypt.      9. And Jehovah said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and behold it is a stiff-necked 
people; </p>
<p>     10. And thou, suffer Me, that Mine anger may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make thyself into great nation.      11. And Moses besought the faces of Jehovah 
his God, and said, Wherefore, O Jehovah, shall Thine anger wax hot against Thy people, which Thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a strong hand?      12. Wherefore 
should the Egyptians speak, saying, Into evil did He bring them forth, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from upon the faces of the earth? Turn back from the wrath of Thine anger, 
and repent of the evil to Thy people.      13. Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel Thy servants, to whom Thou swarest by Thyself, and spoke unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of the 
heavens, and all this land that I have said will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for an age.      14. And Jehovah repented of the evil which He said He would do to His people.    
  15. And Moses looked back, and came down from the mountain, and the two tables of the Testimony were in his hand; the tables were written on the two crossings, hereupon and hereupon were they written.  
    16. And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.      17. And Joshua heard the voice of the people in their shouting, and he said unto 
Moses, There is a voice of war in the camp.      18. And he said, It is not the voice of a cry for victory, neither is it the voice of a cry for being overcome; the voice of a miserable cry do I hear.  
    19. And it came to pass, as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf and the dances; and Moses waxed hot with anger, and he cast the tables out of his hand, and broke them beneath the 
mountain.      20. And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire, and ground it even to powder, and strewed it upon the faces of the waters, and made the sons of Israel drink.   
   21. And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people to thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?      22. And Aaron said, Let not thine anger wax hot, my lord; thou knowest the people, 
that it is in evil.      23. And they said to me, Make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that made us to come up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what hath become 
of him.      24. And I said to them, Whosoever hath any gold, tear ye it off; and they gave it me; and I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.      25. And Moses saw that the people 
was lax, for Aaron had made them lax unto annihilation by those rising up against them; </p>
<p>     26. And Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is for Jehovah? Come unto me. And all the sons 
of Levi were gathered together unto him.      27. And he said to them, Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel, Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh, and pass ye through and return from gate to gate 
in the camp, and slay ye, a man his brother, and a man his companion, and a man his neighbor.      28. And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people that day 
up to three thousand men.      29. And Moses said, Fill ye your hand this day to Jehovah, for a man is against his son, and against his brother; that He may bestow upon you a blessing this day.  
    30. And it came to pass on the day after, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin; and now I will go up unto Jehovah; perchance I shall make expiation for your sin.      31. And 
Moses returned unto Jehovah and said, I beseech Thee! This people hath sinned a great sin, and they have made them gods of gold.      32. And now if Thou wilt forgive their sin! And if not, blot me 
I pray out of Thy book which Thou hast written.      33. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Him that hath sinned against Me, him will I blot out of My book.      34. And now go, lead the people unto that 
which I said to thee; behold Mine angel shall go before thee; and in the day of My visitation I will visit their sin upon them.      35. And Jehovah smote the people, because they had made the calf, 
which Aaron made. * The name "jehovah" is in this connection given by Swedenborg with a small initial letter, doubtless because as applied to the golden calf the name is profane and unworthy of veneration. 
The same remark applies to "divine" as here used, for contrary to his usual custom Swedenborg here writes this word with a small initial letter. See also n. 10566, 10603. [REVISER.] </p>

This shows what should be understood by the Lord's words in Mark,  </p>
<blockquote>
One who believes and is baptized will be saved; but one who does not believe will be condemned. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2016:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 16:16</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'One who believes' 
is one who acknowledges the Lord and receives Divine Truths from Him through the Word; and 'one who is baptized' is one who is being regenerated by the Lord by means of those truths.  </p>

you, let Me alone, and let My anger grow hot against them, and let Me consume them; and let Me make you into a great nation.  <LI value='11'> And Moses entreated the face of<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> Jehovah his God, and said, Why, O 
Jehovah, does Your anger grow hot against Your people, whom You have led out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a strong hand?  <LI value='12'> Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, For evil He led

two tablets of the Testimony were in his hand; the tablets were written on across them both, from the edge of one and from the edge of the other they were written on<A name="fntext5"></a><A href="#fn5"><sup>e</sup></a>.  <LI value='16'> And the tablets were

that he saw the calf, and the dances; and Moses grew hot with anger, and threw the tablets out of his hand and broke them beneath the mountain.  <LI value='20'> And he took the calf which they had made, and burned 
it in the fire, and ground it up till it was powder, and sprinkled it on the face of the water, and made the children of Israel drink it.  <LI value='21'> And Moses said to Aaron, What did this people do to 
you that you have brought so great a sin upon them?  <LI value='22'> And Aaron said, Do not let your anger grow hot, O my lord; you know the people, that they [are set] on evil.  <LI value='23'> And they said to me, Make us

gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and this calf came out.  <LI value='25'> And Moses saw that the people had become undisciplined; for Aaron had caused them to become so undisciplined that those rising 
up against them would annihilate them<A name="fntext7"></a><A href="#fn7"><sup>g</sup></a>.  <LI value='26'> And Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Whoever is for Jehovah, [come] to me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves to him.  <LI value='27'> 
And he said to them, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, Put everyone his sword on his thigh; go to and fro<A name="fntext8"></a><A href="#fn8"><sup>h</sup></a> from gate to gate in the camp, and kill [every] man his brother, and [every] man 
his companion, and [every] man his neighbour.  <LI value='28'> And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people on that day up to three thousand men.  <LI value='29'> And Moses said, Fill 
your hand<A name="fntext9"></a><A href="#fn9"><sup>i</sup></a> today to Jehovah (for [every] man has been against his son and against his brother), so that He may bestow a blessing on you today.  <LI value='30'> And it happened on the next day, that Moses 
said to the people, You have committed a great sin. And now I shall go up to Jehovah; perhaps I shall make expiation for your sin.  <LI value='31'> And Moses returned to Jehovah and said, I implore You; this people 
has committed a great sin, and they have made gods of gold for themselves.  <LI value='32'> And now, if You forgive their sin - and if not, blot me out, I beg You, from Your book which You have written.  <LI value='33'> 
And Jehovah said to Moses, The one who has sinned against Me, I will blot him out of My book.  <LI value='34'> And now, go! lead the people to what I have spoken of to you. Behold, My angel will go before you; and

<p>CAPUT XXXII 1.  Et videbat populus quod tardaret Moscheh descendere de monte; 
et congregatus est populus ad Aharonem, et dicebant ad illum, Surge, fac nobis deos, qui eant ante nos, quia hic Moscheh ille vir qui ascendere fecit nos e terra Aegypti, non scimus quid sit illi. 2. 
 Et dixit ad illos Aharon, Avellite inaures auri quae in auribus mulierum vestrarum, filiorum vestrorum, et filiarum vestrarum, et adferte ad me. 3.  Et avulserunt omnis populus inaures auri quae in 
auribus eorum, et attulerunt ad Aharonem. 4.  Et accepit e manu eorum, et formavit illud caelo, et fecit illud vitulum fusilis; et dixerunt, Hi dii tui, Israel, qui ascendere fecerunt te e terra Aegypti. 5. 
 Et videbat Aharon, et aedificabat altare coram eo, et proclamabat Aharon, et dicebat, {1}Festum jehovae cras. @1 See p. 768 note 7$ 6.  Et surgebant mane postridie, et offerebant holocausta, 
et adducebant pacifica; et sedebat populus ad edendum et bibendum, et surgebant ad ludendum. 7.  Et locutus est JEHOVAH ad Moschen, Vade, descende, quia corrupit se populus tuus, quem ascendere fecisti 
e terra Aegypti. 8.  Recesserunt subito a via quam praecepi illis, fecerunt sibi vitulum fusilis, et adoraverunt illum, et sacrificarunt illi, et dixerunt, Hi dii tui, Israel, qui ascendere {1}fecerunt 
te e terra Aegypti. @1 te fecerunt IT$ 9.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Moschen, Vidi populum hunc, et ecce populus durus cervice ille. 10.  Et tu, sine Mihi, et exardescat ira Mea in illos, et consumam 
illos, et faciam temet in gentem magnam. 11.  Et deprecatus est Moscheh facies JEHOVAE DEI sui, et dixit, Quare, JEHOVAH, exardescat ira Tua in populum Tuum, quem eduxisti e terra Aegypti, virtute 
magna et manu forti? 12.  Quare dicent Aegyptii, dicendo, In malum eduxit illos ad occidendum illos in montibus, et ad consumendum illos a super faciebus terrae? revertere ab (x)excandescentia irae 
Tuae, et paeniteat Te super malum populo Tuo. 13.  Recordare Abrahami, Jischaki, et Israelis, servorum Tuorum, quibus jurasti in Te, et locutus es ad illos, Multiplicabo semen vestrum sicut stellas 
caelorum; et omnem terram hanc, quam dixi, Dabo semini vestro, et hereditabunt in saeculum. 14.  Et paenitebat Jehovam super malo quod dixit facere populo Suo. 15.  Et respexit, et descendit Moscheh 
de monte, et duae tabulae (x)testimonii in manu ejus, tabulae scriptae a duobus transitibus, exhinc et exhinc illae scriptae. 16.  Et tabulae opus DEI illae, et scriptura scriptura DEI illa, excisa 
super tabulis. 17.  Et audivit Joschua vocem populi in vociferatione ejus, et dixit ad Moschen, Vox belli in castris. 18.  Et dixit, Non vox clamoris victoria, et non vox clamoris res perdita, vocem 
clamoris miserabilis ego audio. 19.  Et factum, quemadmodum appropinquavit ad castra, et vidit vitulum et choreas, et exardescebat ira Moscheh, et projecit e manu sua tabulas, et fregit illas sub 
monte. 20.  Et sumpsit vitulum quem fecerunt, et combussit igne, et commoluit usque {1}ad pollinem, et sparsit super facies aquarum, et bibere fecit filios Israelis. @1 in IT$ 21.  Et dixit Moscheh 
ad Aharonem, Quid fecit tibi populus hic quod adduxeris super illum peccatum tam magnum? 22.  Et dixit Aharon, Ne exardescat ira, domine mi; tu nosti populum quod in malo ille. 23.  Et dixerunt mihi, 
Fac nobis deos qui eant ante nos, quia hic Moscheh ille vir qui ascendere fecit nos e terra Aegypti, non scimus quid sit ei. 24.  Et dixi illis, Cui aurum, avellite; et dederunt mihi, et projeci 
illud in ignem, et exivit vitulus hic. 25.  Et vidit Moscheh populum quod dissolutus ille, quia dissolutum fecit illum Aharon ad annihilationem insurgentibus illorum. 26.  Et stetit Moscheh in porta 
castrorum, et dixit, Quis JEHOVAE, ad me; et congregati sunt ad illum omnes filii Levi. 27.  Et dixit illis, Ita dicit JEHOVAH DEUS Israelis, Ponite quisque gladium suum super femur suum, transite et 
redite a porta ad portam in castris, et occidite vir fratrem suum, et vir socium suum, et vir propinquum suum. 28.  Et fecerunt filii Levi secundum verbum Moschis; et cecidit ex populo in die illo 
ad tria milia virorum. 29.  Et dixit Moscheh, Implete manum vestram hodie JEHOVAE, quia vir in filium suum, et in fratrem suum, et ad dandum super vos hodie benedictionem. 30.  Et factum postridie, 
et dixit Moscheh ad populum, Vos peccavistis peccatum magnum; et nunc ascendam ad JEHOVAM, forte expiaturus sum pro peccato vestro. 31.  Et reversus Moscheh ad JEHOVAM, et dixit, Obsecro, peccavit populus 
hic peccatum magnum, et fecerunt sibi deos auri. 32.  Et nunc si remittis peccatum eorum, et si non, dele me, quaeso, e libro Tuo quem scripsisti. 33.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Moschen, Illum qui peccavit 
Mihi, delebo eum e libro Meo. 34.  Et nunc vade, duc populum ad quod dixi tibi; ecce angelus Meus ibit coram te, et in die visitationis Meae et visitabo super illos peccatum eorum. 35.  Et percussit 
JEHOVAH populum super quod fecerunt vitulum quem fecit Aharon. </p>
