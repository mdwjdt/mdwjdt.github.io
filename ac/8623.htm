<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8623节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8623.</strong>“摩西筑了一座坛”表为了敬拜和纪念的神圣之物。这从“坛”的含义清楚可知，“坛”是主的首要代表（参看<a href="2777.htm">2777</a>，<a href="2811.htm">2811</a>，<a href="4489.htm">4489</a>节），因而是指敬拜的神圣之物（<a href="4541.htm">4541</a>节）。它之所以是为了纪念，是因为在古时，人们堆起土丘作为对某事要坚定不移，值得他们回想的一个见证和纪念；后来人们又筑起祭坛（<a href="4192.htm">4192</a>节）。摩西筑坛是为了纪念这一事实：因亚玛力的手攻击耶的宝座，所以耶和华世世代代要和亚玛力争战。筑祭坛也是为了作内主和纪念，这一点也可从流便人，迦得人，玛拿西半支派的人在约旦河边所筑的坛明显看出来。他们告诉那些想与他们交战的以色列人说，他们筑这坛是为了见证这一事实：他们不是要在这个祭坛上，而是在帐幕前的祭坛上献燔祭和别的祭来敬拜耶和华。因此，他们称前者为“我们与你们之间的证据，证明耶和华是神”（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书22.10.htm">22:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/书22.34.htm">34</a>）。</p>

And Moses built an altar. That this signifies for what is holy of worship and of memory, is evident from the signification of "an altar," as being the chief representative of the Lord (see n. 2777, 2811, 
4489), and consequently what is holy of worship (n. 4541). That it is also for memory, is because in ancient times mounds were piled up as a witness unto and in memory of something that was to stand 
firm, and which they were to remember; and afterward also altars (n. 4192); in the present case in memory of the fact that because the hand of Amalek was against the throne of Jah, Jehovah would have 
war against him from generation to generation. That altars were erected for witness and memory, is also evident from the altar that the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh built at 
the Jordan, concerning which they said to the sons of Israel, who on that account were disposed to make war against them, that they built it to be a witness that they would not worship Jehovah by burnt-offerings 
and sacrifices upon this altar, but upon the altar that was before the tabernacle; and therefore they called that altar "a witness between us and you that Jehovah is God" (Josh. 22:10-34). </p>

'And Moses built an altar' means for the holiness of worship and of remembrance. This is clear from the meaning of 'an altar' as the chief representative of the Lord, dealt with in <a href="2777.htm">2777</a>, <a href="2811.htm">2811</a>, <a href="4489.htm">4489</a>, 
and consequently the holiness of worship, <a href="4541.htm">4541</a>. The reason why it is also for remembrance is that in ancient times heaps were erected to serve as a witness and memorial that something was to stand firm 
and be remembered; and later on altars were erected too, <a href="4192.htm">4192</a>. Moses' altar was built for the remembrance of something, which was that because Amalek's hand was against the throne of Jah the war of 
Jehovah would be against him from generation to generation. The fact that altars too were erected to serve as a witness and memorial is clear from the altar which the Reubenites, Gadites, and half tribe 
of Manasseh built by the Jordan. They told the children of Israel who wished to go to war against them that they had built it to be a witness to the fact that they were to worship Jehovah, not with 
burnt offerings and sacrifices on that altar but on the altar before the tabernacle.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> Therefore they called the former, </p>

`Et aedificavit Moscheh altare': quod significet in sanctum cultus et memoriae, constat ex significatione `altaris' quod sit praecipuum repraesentativum Domini, de qua n. 2777, 2811, 4489, et inde sanctum 
cultus, n. 4541; quod etiam sit in memoriam, est quia antiquis temporibus struebantur acervi in testem et memoriam rei quae firma staret et cujus recordaturi, ac postea etiam altaria, n. 4192; 
hic in memoriam rei, quod, quia manus (x)Amaleki contra thronum Jah, bellum Jehovae in illum a generatione in generationem; quod altaria etiam struerentur in testem et memoriam, constat ab altari quod 
Rubenitae, Gadditae, et dimidia tribus Menaschis ad Jordanem aedificabant, de quo dicebant ad filios Israelis, {1}qui ideo bellum illis inferre volebant, quod aedificaverint id ut testis esset {2} quod 
culturi sint Jehovam, non per holocausta et sacrificia super illo, sed super altari quod ante habitaculum; idcirco vocabant altare illud, Testis inter nos et inter vos, quod Jehovah Deus, Jos. xxii
