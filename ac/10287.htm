<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10287节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10287</strong>.“把它抹在外人身上”表与那些不承认主，因而陷入邪恶和邪恶的虚假之人的结合。这从“抹在某人身上”和“外人”的含义清楚可知：“抹在某人身上”当论及“香膏”所表示的神性真理时，是指一种结合；“外人”是指一个不属教会，因而不承认主，进而陷入邪恶和虚假的人。凡不承认主的人都不属教会；凡弃绝主的人都陷入邪恶和虚假。因为良善和真理皆来自主，而非其它源头。“外人”表示这类人，这一点从接下来的圣言经文可以看出来。但首先必须说一说神性真理与那些不承认主之人的结合。这种结合构成亵渎，因为亵渎就是神性真理与邪恶所产生的虚假的结合。构成亵渎的这种结合只可能发生在那些先是承认教会事物，尤其承认主，后来又弃绝它们的人身上。因为对教会真理和主的承认会带来与天堂的接触，从而打开一个人朝向天堂的内层；而后来对它们的弃绝则导致这些真理与邪恶所产生的虚假的结合。因为一个人所承认的一切都被植入他；凡通过承认进入、与一个人同在的东西都不会被销毁。<br />犯亵渎罪的人，其状态是这样：他既与天堂接触，同时也与地狱接触；通过真理与天堂接触，通过邪恶的虚假与地狱接触。因此，在来世，一种撕裂会发生在这类人身上，其内在生命的一切由此毁灭。经历这种撕裂之后，他们几乎不再像人，而是像烧焦的骨头，几乎没有生命在里面。关于亵渎，可参看前面的阐述和说明，即：亵渎者是那些首先承认神的真理，后来又弃绝它们的人（<a href="1001.htm">1001</a>，<a href="1010.htm">1010</a>，<a href="1059.htm">1059</a>，<a href="2051.htm">2051</a>，<a href="3398.htm">3398</a>，<a href="4289.htm">4289</a>，<a href="4601.htm">4601</a>，<a href="6348.htm">6348</a>，<a href="6960.htm">6960</a>，<a href="6963.htm">6963</a>，<a href="6971.htm">6971</a>，<a href="8394.htm">8394</a>节）；自童年早期起就弃绝它们的人，像犹太人和其他人，不是亵渎者（<a href="593.htm">593</a>，<a href="1001.htm">1001</a>，<a href="1059.htm">1059</a>，<a href="3398.htm">3398</a>，<a href="3489.htm">3489</a>，<a href="6963.htm">6963</a>节）；主极其小心地防止亵渎发生在一个人身上（参看<a href="301.htm">301</a>-<a href="303.htm">303</a>，<a href="1327.htm">1327</a>，<a href="1328.htm">1328</a>，<a href="2426.htm">2426</a>，<a href="3398.htm">3398</a>，<a href="3402.htm">3402</a>，<a href="3489.htm">3489</a>，<a href="6595.htm">6595</a>节）。<br />要知道，亵渎的属有很多，构成这些属的种又有很多。因为有些人亵渎教会的良善，有些人亵渎教会的真理；有些人严重亵渎，有些人轻微亵渎；有些人在内在层面上亵渎，有些人在越来越外在的层面上亵渎；有些人通过违背教会的真理和良善的信仰亵渎，有些人通过所过的生活亵渎，有些人则通过敬拜亵渎。因此才会有众多亵渎者的地狱，这些地狱照其亵渎的不同种类而彼此有别，互相分离。亵渎良善者的地狱在背后，而亵渎真理的地狱则在脚下和两侧。它们比其它一切邪恶的地狱都要深，而且很少打开。<br />“外人”表示那些不承认主，并且不愿承认主，无论在教会之外的还是在教会之内的，从而陷入邪恶和邪恶的虚假之人，在从人抽象出来的意义上表示邪恶和邪恶的虚假，这一点从圣言中的许多经文清楚看出来。之所以说“那些不承认主，因而陷入邪恶和邪恶的虚假之人”，是因为那些不承认主的人不可避免地陷入邪恶和邪恶的虚假；因为主是一切良善和一切良善之真理的源头，或说一切良善和一切良善之真理皆来自主。因此，那些弃绝主的人就会陷入邪恶和邪恶的虚假，正如主在约翰福音中所说的话：<br />你们若不信我是基督，必要死在罪中。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.24.htm">8:24</a>）<br />“外人或外邦人”就表示这些人，这一点从下列经文清楚看出来，以赛亚书：<br />你们的地土已经荒凉，你们的城邑被火焚毁；外邦人在你们面前侵吞你们的土地，既被外人倾覆，就成为荒凉。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛1.7.htm">1:7</a>）<br />此处“地”不是指地，“城邑”和“土地”也不是指城市和土地；相反，“地”表示教会；“土地”同样表示教会；“城邑”表示教会的真理，这些真理被称为教义事物，当被自我之爱和尘世之爱的邪恶毁灭时，就被说成是“被火焚毁”。由此明显可知“侵吞土地的外人”表示什么，即毁灭教会的邪恶和邪恶的虚假；也可知“你们的地已经荒凉”和“你们的城邑被火焚毁”表示什么。“地土”或地（land orearth）表示教会（<a href="9325.htm">9325</a>节提到的地方）；“土地”同样表示教会（<a href="566.htm">566</a>，<a href="1068.htm">1068</a>节）；“城”表示教会的教义事物，因而表示教会的真理（<a href="2268.htm">2268</a>，<a href="2451.htm">2451</a>，<a href="2712.htm">2712</a>，<a href="2943.htm">2943</a>，<a href="3216.htm">3216</a>，<a href="4492.htm">4492</a>，<a href="4493.htm">4493</a>节）；“火”表示爱自己爱世界的邪恶（<a href="1297.htm">1297</a>，<a href="1861.htm">1861</a>，<a href="2446.htm">2446</a>，<a href="5071.htm">5071</a>，<a href="5215.htm">5215</a>，<a href="6314.htm">6314</a>，<a href="6832.htm">6832</a>，<a href="7575.htm">7575</a>，<a href="9141.htm">9141</a>节）。<br />耶利米书：<br />我们满面惭愧，因为外邦人进来反对耶和华家的圣所。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.51.htm">51:51</a>）<br />“进来反对耶和华家的圣所的外邦人”是指违背教会的真理和良善的邪恶和邪恶的虚假。“外邦人或外人”这个词用来表示在犹太教会中作为奴仆的外邦民族或非犹太民族的成员，这地的外邦民族或非犹太民族也表示邪恶和虚假（<a href="9320.htm">9320</a>节）。同一先知书：<br />你倒说，不，没有希望；我喜爱外邦人，我必随从他们。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.25.htm">2:25</a>）<br />“喜爱外邦人，随从他们”表示喜爱邪恶和邪恶的虚假，敬拜它们。<br />以西结书：<br />我必使剑临到你们，将你们交在外邦人的手中。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结11.8.htm">11:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结11.9.htm">9</a>）<br />“使剑临到”表示与源于良善的真理争战的邪恶所产生的虚假；“交在外邦人的手中”表示以便他们相信并服侍这些虚假。“剑”表示与虚假争战的真理，在反面意义上表示与真理争战的虚假（参看<a href="2799.htm">2799</a>，<a href="6353.htm">6353</a>，<a href="7102.htm">7102</a>，<a href="8294.htm">8294</a>节）。<br />同一先知书：<br />你要死在外邦人手中，像未受割礼之人的死。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.10.htm">28:10</a>）<br />“未受割礼之人”是指那些过着充满污秽的爱及其欲望的生活之人，无论他们知道多少宗教的教导（<a href="2049.htm">2049</a>，<a href="3412.htm">3412</a>，<a href="3413.htm">3413</a>，<a href="4462.htm">4462</a>，<a href="7045.htm">7045</a>，<a href="7225.htm">7225</a>节），他们的死亡是属灵的死亡；“外邦人手中”表示陷入邪恶本身和邪恶的虚假。<br /><br />耶路撒冷，你这行奸淫的妻，宁肯接外人不接丈夫。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.32.htm">16:32</a>）<br />“耶路撒冷，行奸淫的妻”表示良善被玷污的教会；“接外人”表示在生活和教义上承认或接受邪恶和邪恶的虚假。约珥书：<br />耶路撒冷必成为圣，外邦人不再从其中经过。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥3.17.htm">3:17</a>）<br />“耶路撒冷”在此也表示教会，不过是一个主在其中被过着良善生活并相信来自主的真理之人承认的教会；“外邦人不再从其中经过”表示来自地狱的邪恶和邪恶的虚假将不会进入它。<br />诗篇：<br />外人起来攻击我，强暴人寻索我的灵魂。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗54.3.htm">54:3</a>）<br />此处“外人”也表示邪恶和邪恶的虚假；“强暴人”表示向良善和真理施暴的这些邪恶和虚假。那些只看圣言字义的人只是将“外人或外邦人”理解为那些在教会之外，要起来攻击大卫的人；而对人本身的观念并不进入天堂里的人之思维，或说人的东西丝毫不进入天堂，唯有他们所表示的真实事物才会进入（<a href="8343.htm">8343</a>，<a href="8985.htm">8985</a>，<a href="9007.htm">9007</a>节）；因此，他们想到的不是人或外人，而是陌生或格格不入的事物，也就是与教会疏远的事物，因而是毁灭教会的邪恶和邪恶的虚假；天堂里的人将外人要起来攻击的“大卫”理解为主（<a href="1888.htm">1888</a>，<a href="9954.htm">9954</a>节）。<br />摩西五经：<br />他便离弃造他的神，轻看拯救他的磐石。他们用外邦神明激起祂的妒忌。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.15.htm">32:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.16.htm">16</a>）<br />“离弃神，轻看救他的磐石”表示弃绝主；“用外邦神明激起”表示通过邪恶和邪恶的虚假如此行，“拯救的磐石”是指信之真理方面的主（参看<a href="8581.htm">8581</a>节）。此外，在其它地方（如以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛25.2.htm">25:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛25.5.htm">5</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶30.8.htm">30:8</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结31.11.htm">31:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结31.12.htm">12</a>），“外人或外邦人”也表示邪恶和虚假。<br />由于“外人或外邦人”表示那些陷入邪恶和邪恶的虚假之人，由此在抽象意义上表示邪恶和邪恶的虚假，所以经上禁止外人或外邦人吃圣物（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利22.10.htm">22:10</a>）；外人不可近前来，履行祭司职能或看守圣所；凡近前来的人必被处死（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民1.51.htm">1:51</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民3.10.htm">3:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民3.38.htm">38</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民18.7.htm">18:7</a>）。<br />此外，经上还禁止用凡火（strange fire）烧香，亚伦的儿子拿答、亚比户因用凡火烧香而被天上来的火烧灭（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利10.1.htm">10:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利10.2.htm">2</a>）。因为取自祭坛的圣火表示源于神的爱，而凡火表示来自地狱的爱，因而也表示邪恶及其欲望（参看<a href="1297.htm">1297</a>，<a href="1861.htm">1861</a>，<a href="2446.htm">2446</a>，<a href="5071.htm">5071</a>，<a href="5215.htm">5215</a>，<a href="6314.htm">6314</a>，<a href="6832.htm">6832</a>，<a href="7575.htm">7575</a>，<a href="9141.htm">9141</a>节）。<br />在圣言中，经上还提到那些外路人，在原文，“外族人”是由另一个词，而不是“外邦人”来表达的，“外族人”（the foreign-born）表示虚假本身，如在下列经文中，耶利米哀歌：<br />耶和华啊，求你观看我们的耻辱。我们的产业归与外邦人；我们的房屋归与外族人。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀5.1.htm">5:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀5.2.htm">2</a>）<br />俄巴底亚书：<br />外人使他的力量掳掠，外族人进入他的城门，为耶路撒冷拈阄。（俄巴底亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/俄1.11.htm">1:11</a>）<br />“为耶路撒冷拈阄”表示摧毁教会并驱散它的真理。<br />西番雅书：<br />我必惩罚首领和王子，并一切穿外族人的衣服的。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番1.8.htm">1:8</a>）<br />“穿外族人的衣服的”表示那些陷入虚假的人；因为经历惩罚的“首领和王子”表示表示首要真理，在反面意义上表示首要虚假。首领就具有这种含义（参看<a href="1482.htm">1482</a>，<a href="2089.htm">2089</a>，<a href="5044.htm">5044</a>节）；“王”表示真理本身，在反面意义上表示虚假本身（<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>，<a href="3009.htm">3009</a>，<a href="4581.htm">4581</a>，<a href="4966.htm">4966</a>，<a href="5044.htm">5044</a>，<a href="5068.htm">5068</a>，<a href="6148.htm">6148</a>节）；因此，“王子”表示源于这些真理或虚假的事物。<br />诗篇：<br />求你救拔我，从外族人之子的手里拯救我。他们的口说虚妄的话，他们的右手是说谎的右手。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗144.7.htm">144:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗144.8.htm">8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗144.11.htm">11</a>）<br />很明显，“外族人之子”表示那些陷入虚假的人，因而表示本身，因为经上说：“他们的口说虚妄的话，他们的右手是虚假之右手”；“虚妄”表示教义的虚假，“说谎”表示生活的虚假（<a href="9248.htm">9248</a>节）。</p>

And who shall put of it upon a stranger. That this signifies conjunction with those who do not acknowledge the Lord, thus who are in evils and the falsities of evil, is evident from the signification 
of "putting upon" anyone, when said of Divine truths, which are signified by the "aromatic ointment," as being to conjoin; and from the signification of "a stranger," as being one who is not of the church, 
thus who does not acknowledge the Lord, and consequently is in evils and falsities; for he who does not acknowledge the Lord is not of the church; and he who denies the Lord is in evils and falsities, 
because what is good and true comes from no other source. That such persons are signified by "strangers" will be seen from the passages in the Word which will follow. But something shall first 
be said about the conjunction of Divine truth with those who do not acknowledge the Lord. This conjunction is profanation, for profanation is the conjunction of Divine truth with falsities from evil; 
and this conjunction which is profanation is not possible with any but those who have first acknowledged the things of the church, and especially the Lord, and have afterward denied the same. For by 
the acknowledgment of the truths of the church, and of the Lord, communication is effected with the heavens, and from this the opening of the interiors of man toward heaven; and by denial afterward is 
effected the conjunction of the same with falsities from evil; for all things which a man acknowledges remain implanted, because nothing perishes with man which has entered by means of acknowledgment. 
 [2] The state of the man who commits profanation is that he has communication with the heavens and at the same time with the hells; by truths with the heavens, and by falsities of evil with the hells; 
from this in the other life there comes a tearing asunder, whereby everything of interior life perishes. After this tearing asunder such persons barely appear as men, but as burnt bones in which 
there is but little life. (See what has already been said and shown about profanation, namely: That those profane who have first acknowledged truths Divine, and afterward deny them, n. 1001, 1010, 1059, 
2051, 3398, 4289, 4601, 6348, 6960, 6963, 6971, 8394: That those who have denied them from infancy, such as the Jews and others, do not profane, n. 593, 1001, 1059, 3398, 3489, 6963: And that the greatest 
care is taken by the Lord to prevent profanation with man, see n. 301-303, 1327, 1328, 2426, 3398, 3402, 3489, 6595.) [3] But be it known that there are very many genera of profanation, and of 
these many species; for there are those who profane the goods of the church, and there are those who profane its truths; there are those who profane much, and those who profane little; there are those 
who profane interiorly, and those who profane more and more exteriorly; there are those who profane through belief contrary to the truths and goods of the church; there are those who profane through 
the life; and there are those who profane through the worship. Hence result many hells of profaners, which are distinct from one another according to the diversities of the profanation. The hells of 
the profanations of good are at the back; but the hells of the profanations of truth are under the feet and at the sides. Such hells are deeper than the hells of all other evils, and are seldom opened. [4] 
That "strangers" denote those who do not acknowledge the Lord, and are unwilling to acknowledge Him, whether they be out of the church or within it, thus who are in evils and in the falsities 
of evil, and in a sense abstracted from persons, that they are evils and the falsities of evil, is evident from many passages in the Word. It is said "those who do not acknowledge the Lord, thus who are 
in evils and the falsities of evil," because those who do not acknowledge the Lord must needs be in evils and the falsities of evil; for all good and the truth of good are from the Lord, and therefore 
those who deny the Lord are in evils and the falsities of evil; according to the words of the Lord in John: </p>
<p>     Unless ye believe that I am, ye shall die in your sins (John 8:24). [5] That these 
are "strangers," is evident from the following passages. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Your land is a solitude, your cities are burned with fire; your ground, strangers shall devour it in your presence; and it shall 
be a solitude, as the overthrow of strangers (Isa. 1:7). By "land" in this passage is not meant land, nor by "cities" and "ground," cities and ground; but by "land" is meant the church; in like 
manner by "ground;" and by "cities," the truths of the church which are called doctrinal things, and which are said to be "burned with fire" when they have been consumed by the evils of the loves of self 
and of the world. From this it is evident what is signified by "strangers devouring the ground," namely, that evils and the falsities of evil devour the church; and by "the land being desolate" (that 
"land" or "earth" denotes the church, see the places cited in n. 9325; in like manner "ground," n. 566, 1068; that "cities" denote the doctrinal things of the church, thus its truths, n. 2268, 2451, 
2712, 2943, 3216, 4492, 4493; and "fire" the evils of the loves of self and of the world, n. 1297, 1861, 2446, 5071, 5215, 6314, 6832, 7575, 9141). [6] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Disgrace hath covered our 
faces, seeing that strangers are come against the sanctuaries of the house of Jehovah (Jer. 51:51). "Strangers against the sanctuaries of the house of Jehovah" denote evils and the falsities of evil 
against the truths and goods of the church; those of the nations were called "strangers" who were servants in the Jewish Church; and by the "nations" of that land are also signified evils and falsities 
(n. 9320). In the same: </p>
<p>     Thou sayest, There is no hope, no; but I will love strangers, and after them will I go (Jer. 2:25). "To love strangers, and to go after them," denotes to love evils and 
the falsities of evil, and to worship them.  [7] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     I will bring the sword upon you, and I will give you into the hand of strangers (Ezek. 11:8, 9); </p>
<p>where "to bring a sword" denotes 
falsities from evil fighting against truths from good; "to give into the hand of strangers" denotes that they should believe and serve these falsities. (That a "sword" denotes truth fighting against 
falsities, and in the opposite sense falsities fighting against truths, see n. 2799, 6353, 7102, 8294.) [8] Again: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised in the hand of strangers (Ezek. 
28:10). "The uncircumcised" denote those who in respect to the life are in filthy loves and their cupidities, however much they may be in doctrinal things (n. 2049, 3412, 3413, 4462, 7045, 7225), whose 
death is spiritual death; "in the hand of strangers" denotes in evils themselves and the falsities of evils. [9] Again: </p>
<p>     Jerusalem is an adulterous wife under her man, she receiveth strangers 
(Ezek. 16:32). "Jerusalem an adulterous wife" denotes the church in which good is adulterated; "to receive strangers" denotes to acknowledge evils and the falsities of evil in life and doctrine. And 
in Joel: </p>
<p>     Jerusalem shall be holiness, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more (Joel 3:17). "Jerusalem" denotes the church, but that in which the Lord is acknowledged, men live 
in good, and believe in the truths which are from the Lord; that "strangers shall not pass through her any more" denotes that the evils and falsities of evil which are from hell shall not enter. [10] 
In David: </p>
<p>     Strangers are risen up against me, and violent men have sought after my soul (Ps. 54:3). Here also "strangers" denote evils and the falsities of evil; "violent men" denote the same 
doing violence to goods and truths. Those who look solely at the sense of the letter of the Word, understand nothing else by "strangers" than those who are outside the church, and that they will rise 
up against David; whereas nothing of person enters into the heavens, but only the things which are signified (n. 8343, 8985, 9007); thus not strangers, but instead of them strange things, which are those 
which are estranged from the church, thus evils and the falsities of evil which destroy the church; by "David" also, against whom they would rise up, is perceived the Lord (n. 1888, 9954). [11] In 
Moses: </p>
<p>     He forsook God who made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation; they provoked Him to jealousy by strangers (Deut. 32:15, 16). "To forsake God, and lightly esteem the Rock 
of salvation," denotes to deny the Lord; "to provoke by strange things" denotes by evils and the falsities of evil. (That a "Rock" denotes the Lord as to the truths of faith, see n. 8581.) Moreover, in 
other places also "strangers" denote evils and falsities (as in Isa. 25:2, 5; Jer. 30:8; Ezek. 31:11, 12). [12] As "strangers" signified those who are in evils and the falsities of evil, and from this 
in the abstract sense, evils and the falsities of evil, therefore it was forbidden that a stranger should eat the holy things (Lev. 22:10); that a stranger should approach the office of the priesthood, 
or the service of the sanctuary; and that if he did so he should be slain (Num. 1:51; 3:10, 38; 18:7). [13] It was also forbidden to burn incense from strange fire, for doing which Nadab and Abihu, 
sons of Aaron, were consumed by fire from heaven (Lev. 10:1, 2); for by the holy fire which was from the altar was signified love Divine; but by "strange fire," infernal love, and hence also evils 
and their cupidities (see n. 1297, 1861, 2446, 5071, 5215, 6314, 6832, 7575, 9141). [14] Mention is also made of "foreigners," which is expressed in the original tongue by another word than "strangers," 
and by "foreigners" are signified falsities themselves, as in these passages: </p>
<p>     O Jehovah look on our reproach; our inheritance is turned unto strangers, and our houses unto foreigners (Lam. 
5:1, 2).      Strangers have led captive his strength, and foreigners have entered his gates, and shall cast a lot upon Jerusalem (Obad. 11). "To cast a lot upon Jerusalem" denotes to destroy the church, 
and to dissipate its truths. [15] In Zephaniah: </p>
<p>     I will visit upon the princes, and upon the king's sons, and upon all such as are clothed in the clothing of a foreigner (Zeph. 1:8). "Those 
clothed in the clothing of a foreigner" denote those who are in falsities; for "princes and the king's sons," upon whom was visitation, denote the chief truths, and in the opposite sense the chief 
falsities (that princes have this signification, see n. 1482, 2089, 5044; and that "kings" denote truths themselves, and in the opposite sense falsities themselves, n. 2015, 2069, 3009, 4581, 4966, 5044, 
5068, 6148); consequently "the king's sons" denote that which is derived therefrom. [16] In David: </p>
<p>     Deliver me and rescue me out of the hand of the sons of the foreigner, whose mouth speaketh 
emptiness, and their right hand is a right hand of a lie (Ps. 144:7, 8, 11). That "the sons of the foreigner" denote those who are in falsities, thus falsities, is very evident, for it is said, "whose 
mouth speaketh emptiness, and their right hand is the right hand of a lie;" for "emptiness" denotes falsity of doctrine, and "a lie," falsity of life (n. 9248). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10287</b></p><p><b>10287.</b>
'And he who puts any of it on a foreigner' means a joining together for those who do not acknowledge the Lord, and so who are subject to evils and to the falsities of evil. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'putting it on someone' - when the subject is Divine Truths, meant by the sweet-smelling ointment - as a joining together; and from the meaning of 'a foreigner' as those who do not belong to the 
Church, thus those who do not acknowledge the Lord, consequently who are subject to evils and falsities. Anyone who does not acknowledge the Lord does not belong to the Church; and anyone who rejects 
the Lord is subject to evils and falsities. For goodness and truth come from no other source than Him. The fact that such people are meant by 'foreigners' will be clear from the places in the Word 
which will follow below. But first something must be stated regarding the joining of Divine Truth among those who do not acknowledge the Lord. Such a joining together constitutes profanation, for profanation 
is a joining of Divine Truth to falsities arising from evil. The joining together that constitutes profanation is something which cannot happen with any at all except those who have first acknowledged 
the things which are the Church's, and especially the Lord, but subsequently reject them. For acknowledgement of the Church's truths and of the Lord leads to contact with the heavens, and consequently 
to an opening of a person's interiors towards heaven; and a subsequent rejection of them leads to a joining of the same truths to falsities arising from evil. For everything a person acknowledges 
remains implanted in him; nothing present with a person which has entered through acknowledgement is destroyed.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The state of a person with whom profanation exists is one in which he is in 
contact with the heavens and at the same time with the hells, through truths with the heavens and through the falsities of evil with the hells. As a result of this, in the next life a tearing apart 
takes place with such people, which destroys the whole of their inner life. After the tearing apart they hardly look like human beings any longer; they look like bones that have been scorched and have 
little life in them. See what has been stated and shown previously regarding profanation in the following places,  </p>

them, <a href="1001.htm">1001</a>, <a href="1010.htm">1010</a>, <a href="1059.htm">1059</a>, <a href="2051.htm">2051</a>, <a href="3398.htm">3398</a>, <a href="4289.htm">4289</a>, <a href="4601.htm">4601</a>, <a href="6348.htm">6348</a>, <a href="6959.htm">6959</a>, <a href="6963.htm">6963</a>, <a href="6971.htm">6971</a>, <a href="8394.htm">8394</a>.

<p><b>[3]</b>
 But it should be realized 
that the genera of profanation are very many, and the species composing those genera are very many. For there are those who profane the Church's forms of good and those who profane its truths; there 
are those who profane greatly and those who profane slightly; there are those who profane on a more internal level and those who profane on increasingly external levels; there are those who profane 
through belief contrary to the Church's truths and forms of good, there are those who profane through the life they lead, and those who profane through their worship. Consequently there exist very many 
hells of profaners, which are distinct and separate from one another, in accord with their different kinds of profanation. The hells of those who profane good are behind one's back, whereas the hells 
of profanation of truth are underfoot and to the sides. They are deeper than the hells of all other evils and are rarely opened.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Those who do not acknowledge the Lord and refuse to do so, whether 
they are outside the Church or inside it, thus those who are subject to evils and to the falsities of evil, are meant by 'foreigners'; and in the abstract sense, without reference to actual persons, 
evils and the falsities of evil are meant. This is clear from very many places in the Word. The reason for saying 'those who do not acknowledge the Lord, thus those who are subject to evils and 
the falsities of evil' is that people who do not acknowledge the Lord are inevitably subject to evils and the falsities of evil; for the Lord is the source of all good and of all the truth of good. Those 
therefore who reject the Lord are subject to evils and the falsities of evil, as accords with the Lord's words in John,  </p>

<p>Here land should not be understood by 'land', nor cities and ground by 'cities' and 'ground'. 
Instead the Church should be understood by 'land' and likewise by 'ground', and by 'cities' the Church's truths, called its doctrinal teachings, which are said to have been 'burned with fire' when they

<p>'Foreigners coming against the sanctuaries

<p>'Bringing a sword upon' means falsities arising from evil set in conflict against truths springing from good. 'Giving into the hand of foreigners' means 
to the end that they may believe and serve those falsities. For the meaning of 'a sword' as truth engaged in conflict against falsities, and in the contrary sense falsity engaged in conflict against

<p>Here also 'foreigners' stands for evils and the falsities of evil, and 'violent ones' for these same evils and

<p>'Forsaking

Dominum non possunt {16}aliter quam in malis et falsis mali esse, nam a Domino est omne bonum et verum boni; quapropter qui negant Dominum in malis et {17} falsis mali sunt, secundum Domini verba apud 
Johannem, 	Nisi credideritis quod Ego sim, moriemini in peccatis vestris, viii 24. {18}Quod `alieni' illi sint, constat ab his locis: apud Esaiam, [5] 	Terra vestra solitudo, urbes vestrae exustae 
igne; humum (x)vestram coram vobis alieni comedent, et erit solitudo sicut eversio alienorum, i 7; </p>
<p>per (x)`terram' hic non intelligitur terra, nec per `urbes' et per `humum' urbes et humus, sed per 
`terram' intelligitur Ecclesia, similiter per `humum,' et per `urbes' vera Ecclesiae, quae doctrinalia vocantur, quae `exusta igne' dicuntur cum ex malis amorum sui et mundi {19}consumpta sunt; inde 
patet quid significatur per quod `alieni comedent humum,' quod nempe mala et falsa mali Ecclesiam, et per quod `terra erit solitudo et urbes exustae igni'; quod `terra' sit Ecclesia, videatur in {20}locis 
citatis n. 9325, et quod similiter `humus,' n. 566, 1068; quod    `urbes' sint doctrinalia Ecclesiae, ita vera ejus, n. 2268, (x)2451, 2712, 2943, 3216, 4492, 4493, et quod `ignis' sit malum amorum 
sui et mundi [6] n. 1297, 1861, 2446, 5071, 5215, 6314, 6832, 7575, (x)9141: apud Jeremiam, 	Obtexit ignominia facies nostras, cum venerunt alieni contra sanctuaria domus Jehovae, li 51; </p>
<p>`alieni 
contra sanctuaria domus Jehovae' sunt mala et falsa mali contra vera et bona Ecclesiae; (m)alieni dicebantur {21}illi ex gentibus qui in Ecclesia Judaica serviebant, et per gentes illius terrae significantur 
etiam mala et falsa, n. 9320:(n) apud eundem, 	Dicis, Desperatum est, non; sed amabo alienos, et post hos ibo, ii 25; </p>
<p>`amare alienos et ire post illos' est amare mala et falsa mali, et colere 
[7] illa: apud Ezechielem, 	Gladium adducam super vos, et dabo vos in manum alienorum, xi 8 [,9]; </p>
<p>`gladium adducere' est falsa ex malo pugnantia contra vera ex bono, `dare in manum alienorum' est 
ut credant et serviant falsis illis; quod `gladius' sit verum pugnans contra falsa, et in opposito sensu [8] falsum pugnans contra {22}vera, videatur n. 2799, 6353, 7102, 8294: apud eundem, 	Mortibus 
praeputiatorum morieris, in manu alienorum, xxvii 10; </p>
<p>`praeputiati' sunt {23} qui in spurcis amoribus et eorum cupiditatibus quoad vitam, utcumque in doctrinalibus, n. 2049, 3412, 3413, 4462, 7045, 
7225, quorum mors est mors spiritualis; `in manu alienorum' est in ipsis malis et falsis mali: apud eundem, [9] 	Hierosolyma mulier adultera, sub viro suo accipit alienos, xvi 32; </p>
<p>`Hierosolyma mulier 
adultera' pro Ecclesia in qua adulteratum est bonum, `accipere alienos' pro agnoscere vita et doctrina mala et falsa mali: apud Joelem, 	Hierosolyma erit sanctitas, nec alieni transibunt per eam   
  amplius, iv 17 [A.V. iii 17]; </p>
<p>`Hierosolyma' etiam hic pro Ecclesia, sed in qua agnoscitur Dominus, {24} vivitur bono et creditur veris quae {25}a Domino, `alieni non transibunt per eam amplius' sunt 
mala et falsa mali quae ab inferno, quod non intratura: apud Davidem, [10] 	Alieni surrexerunt contra me, et violenti quaesiverunt animam meam, Ps. liv 5 [A.V. 3]; </p>
<p>`alieni' etiam hic pro malis et 
falsis mali, `violenti' pro iisdem {26}violentiam inferentibus bonis et veris. (m)Qui solum sensum litterae Verbi intuentur, per `alienos' non aliud {27}intelligunt quam illos qui extra Ecclesiam sunt, 
et quod illi surrecturi contra Davidem; sed in caelos non intrat aliquid personae, {28}verum res quae significantur, n. 8343, 8985, 9007, ita non alieni, sed pro illis aliena, quae sunt quae abalienata 
ab Ecclesia, ita mala et falsa mali quae Ecclesiam destruunt; per `Davidem' etiam, {29}contra quem surrecturi, etiam percipitur Dominus, n. 1888, 9954: (n)apud Moschen, [11] 	Deseruit Deum Qui fecit 
eum, et vilipendit petram salutis suae; ad zelum provocarunt Ipsum per alienos, {30} Deut. xxxii 15, 16; </p>
<p>`deserere Deum, et vilipendere petram salutis' pro {31} negare Dominum, `provocare per alienos' 
pro per mala et falsa mali; quod `petra salutis' sit Dominus quoad vera fidei, videatur n. 8581. Praeter etiam alibi `alieni' pro malis et falsis, ut {32}Esai. xxv 2, 4, 5; {33}Jer. xxx 8; {34}Ezech. 
xxxi 11, 12. 	[12] Quoniam `alieni' significabant illos qui in malis et falsis mali sunt, et inde in sensu abstracto mala et falsa mali, ideo vetitum fuit ne alienus comederet {35}sanctum, Lev. 
xxii 10; quod alienus non appropinquaret ad functionem sacerdotii, aut ad custodiam sanctuarii; et si accederet, quod [13] occideretur, Num. i 51, iii 10, 38, xviii 7; etiam quod non suffiretur ex igne 
alieno, ex quo quia suffiverunt Nadab et Abihu filii Aharonis, igne e caelo consumpti sunt, Lev. x 1, 2; per ignem enim sanctum qui ex altari, significabatur amor Divinus, per ignem autem alienum amor 
infernalis, (d)et inde quoque mala et eorum cupiditates, videatur {36} n. 1297, 1861, 2446, 5071, 5215, 6314, 6832, 7575, (x)9141. [14] Nominantur etiam {37} alienigenae, alia voce quam alieni, in 
lingua originali, et per illos significantur ipsa falsa, ut in Threnis, 	Jehovah, respice ad ignominiam nostram; hereditas nostra aversa est ad alienos, et domus nostrae ad alienigenas, v 1, 2: </p>
<p>apud 
Obadiam, 	Captivum duxerunt alieni robur ejus, et alienigenae intraverunt portas ejus, et super Hierosolymam jacient sortem, vers. 11; </p>
<p>`jacere sortem super Hierosolymam' pro destruere Ecclesiam, 
et dissipare [15] vera ejus: apud Zephaniam, 	Visitabo super principes et super filios regis, et super omnes indutos indumento alienigenae, i 8; </p>
<p>`induti indumento alienigenae' pro illis qui in falsis 
sunt, nam principes et filii regis super quos visitatio, sunt primaria vera, et in opposito sensu, primaria falsa; quod `principes' illa significent, videatur 1482, 2089, 5044, quod `reges' sint ipsa 
vera, et in opposito sensu ipsa falsa, n. 2015, 2069, 3009, 4581, 4966, 5044, 5068, 6148, inde `filii regis' sunt [16] quae inde: apud Davidem, 	Libera me, et eripe e manu filiorum alienigenae, quorum 
os loquitur vanitatem; et dextra eorum dextra mendacii, Ps. cxliv 7, 8, 11; </p>
<p>quod `filii alienigenae' sint qui in falsis, ita falsa, patet manifeste, nam dicitur, Quorum os loquitur vanitatem, et 
dextra eorum dextra mendacii, `vanitas' enim est falsitas doctrinae, et `mendacium' falsum vitae, n. 9248. @1 ita$ @2 qui enim non agnoscunt Dominum, illi non ab Ecclesia sunt; quod alieni illos significent
