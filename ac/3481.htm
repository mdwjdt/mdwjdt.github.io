<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3481节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3481.</strong>我经常与来世的犹太人交谈。他们出现在前方的低地，就在左脚那个层面之下。我曾向他们谈到圣言、迦南地和主。我说，圣言含有世人看不见的极深奥秘。他们对这一点深表赞同。然后我说，其中一切的奥秘都在论述弥赛亚和祂的国度。这一点他们也表示同意。但当我告诉他们说，希伯来语中的弥赛亚就是希腊语中的基督时，他们就不愿听了。同样，当我说，弥赛亚就是那至圣者，耶和华在祂里面，以色列的圣者和雅各的神并非指其他人；因为祂就是至圣者，除了那些神圣的人，当然不是外在神圣，而是内在神圣的人，因而除了那些没有受到污秽的尘世之爱影响，或高举自己，对其它民族持优越态度的人外，没有人能进入祂的国度时，他们也听不进去。<br />后来我说，根据预言，弥赛亚的国必永远长存，与祂同在的人也必永远承受这地。如果祂的国度属于这个世界，并且他们被带入迦南地，那么这国只能持续构成人寿命的区区数十年。此外，自犹太人被逐出迦南地后，所有死了的人都享受不到这种幸福。我说，他们本可以由此知道迦南地代表并表示天国；事实上，他们很容易知道这一点，因为他们现在知道自己就在来世，并将活到永远，因此明显可知这来世就是弥赛亚拥有其国度之地。我继续说，如果他们被允许与天使交谈，他们就有可能知道，整个天使天堂都是主的国度。<br />我补充说，以西结书所描述的新地、新耶路撒冷和新殿无非是指弥赛亚的这个国度。对于这些事，他们无法作出任何回应。只是在听到他们可能被领进迦南地，并且区区数十年后就死掉，将他们要在那里所享受的幸福抛在身后时，他们会悲伤哭泣。</p>

I have very frequently spoken with the Jews in the other life. They appear in front, in the lower earth, beneath the plane of the left foot. I once spoke to them concerning the Word, the land of Canaan, 
and the Lord: concerning the Word, that there are in it deepest arcana which are not manifest to men; and this they affirmed; then, that all the arcana which are therein treat of the Messiah and His 
kingdom which also they were willing to allow: but when I said that Messiah in the Hebrew tongue is the same as Christ in the Greek, they were not willing to hear. Again, when I said that the Messiah 
is most holy, and that Jehovah is in Him, and that no other is meant by the Holy One of Israel and by the God of Jacob; and that because He is most holy, none can be in His kingdom but those who are 
holy, not in external form but internal, thus who are not in the unclean love of the world, and in the exaltation of themselves against other nations, and in hatred among themselves, this they could 
not hear.  [2] Afterwards when I told them that according to the prophecies the Messiah's kingdom must be eternal, and that they who are with Him will also inherit the earth forever; and that if His 
kingdom were of this world, and they were to be introduced into the land of Canaan, it would only be for the few years which are of a man's life; besides that all those who died after they were driven 
out of the land of Canaan would not enjoy such blessedness and that from this they might know that by the land of Canaan is represented and signified the heavenly kingdom; and especially as they now 
know that they are in the other life, and are to live forever, so that it is manifest that the Messiah has His kingdom there; and that if it were given them to speak with angels they might know that 
the universal angelic heaven is His kingdom; and moreover that by the new earth, the New Jerusalem, and the new temple in Ezekiel, nothing can be signified but such a kingdom of the Messiah-to these things 
they could make no reply, except merely that they who were to be introduced into the land of Canaan by the Messiah, and were to die after so few years and leave the blessedness which they were to 
enjoy there, would weep bitterly. </p>

I have quite often been in conversation with Jews in the next life. They appear in a forward position on the lower earth below the level of the left foot, and on one occasion I also spoke about the Word, 
the land of Canaan, and the Lord. I said that the Word contained very deep arcana which are not visible to men. This point they agreed with. After that I said that all the arcana there deal with 
the Messiah and His kingdom. This also they assented to. But when I told them that Messiah in Hebrew is the same as Christ in Greek they would not listen. And again when I said that the Messiah was the 
Most Holy One, that Jehovah was within Him, that none other was meant by the Holy One of Israel and by the God of Jacob, and that seeing that He is the Most Holy One none can be in His kingdom except 
those who are holy not outwardly but inwardly - who are not accordingly under the influence of the filthy love of the world, or of a superior attitude towards other nations, or of hatred for one another 
- they could not listen to it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 After that I said that the Messiah's kingdom according to prophecy was going to last for ever, and those with Him would also inherit the land for ever. If His 
kingdom were of this world and they were brought into the land of Canaan it would last only for the few years that constitute the human life-span. Besides, all who had died since the expulsion of the 
Jews from the land of Canaan would not enjoy such blessedness. From this, I said, they could recognize that the land of Canaan represented and meant the heavenly kingdom; indeed they would recognize 
it all the more easily, in that they now knew they were in the next life and were going to live for ever, from which it was evident that this next life was the place where the Messiah had His kingdom. 
And, I continued, if they were allowed to talk to angels they could know that the whole angelic heaven was the Lord's kingdom. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 I added that by the new earth, the new Jerusalem, and the new temple 
described in Ezekiel nothing else could be meant than such a kingdom of the Messiah. To all these points they were unable to make any response apart from weeping bitterly at the prospect of being 
led into the land of Canaan by the Messiah only to die after so few years and leave behind the blessedness they were to enjoy there. </p>

In sermone {1}fueram saepius cum Judaeis qui in altera vita; apparent antrorsum in terra inferiore sub plano sinistri pedis, et semel quoque de Verbo, de terra Canaane, et de Domino: de Verbo quod arcanissima 
ibi sint quae non patent coram hominibus; hoc affirmabant; dein quod omnia arcana quae ibi, agant de Messia et Ipsius regno; hoc quoque volebant; sed cum dicerem quod Messias in Hebraea lingua 
sit idem ac Christus in Graeca, non audire volebant: iterum cum dicerem quod Messias sit sanctissimus, et quod Jehovah in Ipso, et quod non alius per Sanctum Israelis et per Deum Jacobi intelligatur, 
et quia Ille sanctissimus, quod non in regno Ipsius possint esse nisi qui sancti sunt non externa forma sed interna, ita (t)qui non in amore sordido mundi, inque elatione contra alias gentes, et in 
odiis {2}inter se, hoc non potuerunt audire: postea quod Messiae regnum secundum prophetias erit {3}aeternum, et qui cum illo, etiam in aeternum hereditabunt terram; [2] si regnum {4}foret ex mundo, 
et illi in terram Canaanem introducerentur, quod foret pro paucis annis qui sunt vitae hominis, praeter quod omnes illi qui mortui sunt postquam expulsi (c)e terra Canaane, non fruerentur tali beatitudine; 
et quod inde scire potuissent quod per terram Canaanem repraesentatum {5}sit et significatum regnum caeleste, et eo magis cum illi nunc sciunt quod in altera vita sint, et in {6}aeternum victuri, 
ita quod {7}pateat ut Messias ibi Suum regnum habeat; et si loqui illis detur cum angelis, quod scire possint quod universum caelum angelicum sit Ipsius regnum; [3] praeter quod per novam terram, novam 
Hierosolymam, et per novum templum apud Ezechielem, non aliud significari queat quam tale regnum Messiae {8}; (x)ad haec non potuerunt respondere, (m)solum quod qui introducendi in terram Canaanem 
a Messia, si post tam paucos annos morerentur, et beatitudinem illam quam ibi habituri, relinquerent, acerbe lacrimarent.(n) @1 fui$  @2 i et vindictis$  @3 i in$  @4 i ejus$  @5 et significatum
