<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7989节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7989.</strong>“这是耶和华的看守夜”表主与那些处于真理和良善的人，以及那些陷入邪恶，并因此陷入纯粹的虚假之人的同在。这从“夜”和“耶和华的看守”的含义清楚可知：“夜”是指一种诅咒的状态（参看<a href="7851.htm">7851</a>节）；“耶和华的看守”是指主的同在和随之而来的保护。因为通过主的同在，那些处于良善，并因此处于真理的人被光照，而那些陷入邪恶，并因此陷入虚假的人则变瞎。而且通过主的同在，那些即将被提入天堂的人从诅咒中被带出来，因为主使他们回避邪恶，并将他们保守在良善中，这一切凭的是主的大力。通过主的同在，那些即将被投入地狱的人也被带入诅咒，因为他们照主同在的程度而陷入邪恶（<a href="7643.htm">7643</a>，<a href="7926.htm">7926</a>节）。正因如此，这种状态和这个时间被称为“耶和华的看守夜”。此外，下文以引领他们的日间云柱和夜间火柱（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出13.21.htm">13:21</a>）来描述主的同在；在以色列营和埃及人营之间的立柱子本身，以及当耶和华从柱中观看埃及人的营时，埃及人就淹没在红海中（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出14.19.htm">14:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出14.20.htm">20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出14.24.htm">24</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出14.27.htm">27</a>）则描述了主既与那些处于良善和真理的人同在，也与那些陷入邪恶和虚假的人同在。</p>

A night of watches is this to Jehovah. That this signifies the presence of the Lord with those who are in truth and good, and with those who are in evil and thence in mere falsity, is evident from the 
signification of "night," as being a state of damnation (see n. 7851); and from the signification of the "watches to Jehovah," as being the presence of the Lord and thence protection; for by the presence 
of the Lord those are enlightened who are in good and thence in truth, and those are made blind who are in evil and thence in falsity; and also by the presence of the Lord those are brought out 
from damnation who are to be raised into heaven, for they are withheld from evil and are kept in good, and this by a strong force from the Lord; and by the presence of the Lord those also who are to be 
cast down into hell are brought into damnation, for according to the degree of the Lord's presence they are in evil (n. 7643, 7926). Hence then it is that this state and this time are called "a night 
of watches to Jehovah." The presence of the Lord is described in what follows by the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night, to lead them (Exod. 13:21); and His presence both with those 
who were in good and truth, and with those who were in evil and falsity, is described by that pillar interposing itself between the camp of Israel and the camp of the Egyptians, and that when Jehovah 
looked forth from it to the camp of the Egyptians, the Egyptians were immersed in the sea Suph (Exod. 14:19, 20, 24-27). </p>

'This was the night when Jehovah was keeping watch' means the Lord's presence with those governed by truth and good and with those ruled by evil and consequently by utter falsity. This is clear from 
the meaning of 'night' as a state of damnation, dealt with in <a href="7851.htm">7851</a>; and from the meaning of 'Jehovah's keeping watch' as the Lord's presence and consequent protection For through the Lord's presence those 
governed by good and therefore guided by truth are given light, and those ruled by evil and consequently by falsity are made blind. Also through the Lord's presence those who are to be raised into 
heaven are brought out of damnation, for they are held back from evil and maintained in good by the Lord, and with great force. And through the Lord's presence too those who are to be cast down into 
hell are brought to damnation, for as the Lord presents Himself to them more completely, so they descend into evil, <a href="7643.htm">7643</a>, <a href="7926.htm">7926</a>. This then is why that state and that time are called 'the night when Jehovah 
was keeping watch'. Further on, the Lord's presence is described by the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night, present there to lead them, Exod.13:21. And His presence both with 
those guided by goodness and truth and with those steeped in evil and falsity is described when it says that the pillar positioned itself between the camp of Israel and the camp of the Egyptians, and 
that when Jehovah looked from it towards the camp of the Egyptians, the Egyptians were drowned in the Sea Suph, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2014:19,%2020,%2024-27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 14:19, 20, 24-27</a>. </p>

`Nox custodiarum haec Jehovae': quod significet Domini praesentiam apud illos qui in vero et bono, et apud illos qui in malo et inde in mero falso, constat ex significatione `noctis' quod sit status 
damnationis, de qua n. 7851; et ex significatione `custodiarum Jehovae' quod sit praesentia Domini (c)et inde tutatio; per praesentiam enim Domini illustrantur illi qui in bono et inde in vero, ac occaecantur 
illi qui in malo et inde falso; tum per praesentiam Domini educuntur illi e damnatione qui elevandi in caelum, nam detinentur a malo ac tenentur in bono, et hoc vi forti, a Domino; et per praesentiam 
Domini etiam inducuntur in damnationem qui dejiciendi in infernum, nam secundum gradum praesentiae Domini in malo sunt, n. 7926, 7643; inde nunc est quod status ille ac tempus illud dicatur 
`nox custodiarum Jehovae.'  Praesentia Domini in sequentibus describitur per `columnam nubis interdiu et columnam ignis noctu, ad ducendum illos,' Exod. xiii 21, et praesentia tam apud illos qui in bono 
et vero quam apud illos qui in malo et falso, per quod `columna illa interponeret se inter castra Israelis et inter castra Aegyptiorum,' et quod `cum Jehovah prospiceret inde ad castra Aegyptiorum, 
quod Aegyptii immersi sint in mare Suph,' Exod. xiv 19, 20, 24-27. </p>
