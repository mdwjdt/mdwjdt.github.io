<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7545节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7545.</strong>“我若伸手”表一切交流可能被夺走。这从“手”的含义清楚可知，“手”是指能力（参看<a href="4931.htm">4931</a>-<a href="4937.htm">4937</a>，<a href="6292.htm">6292</a>，<a href="6947.htm">6947</a>，<a href="7188.htm">7188</a>，<a href="7189.htm">7189</a>，<a href="7518.htm">7518</a>节），“耶和华的手”是指全能（<a href="878.htm">878</a>，<a href="3387.htm">3387</a>，<a href="7518.htm">7518</a>节）。因此，“伸手”表示展示能力，并且通过全能来展示。这种全能由耶和华说，祂能打发一切灾殃进入他的心，和他臣仆并他百姓来描述，由此表示一切邪恶会一起冲进来，因此与天堂事物的交流或接触将被夺走。这种能力的展示就是此处这句话所表示的。前面早已说明这种交流是何情形。也就是说，在来世侵扰正直人的，是那些在世时身为教会的一部分，读过圣言，知道其教会的信之教义，也宣称相信它们，然而却过着邪恶生活的人。在来世，只要仍拥有信之事物，他们就与天堂保持接触，无法被投入地狱。因此，正是这些事物分阶段逐步从他们那里被夺走；它们被夺走后，这些恶人就再也没有任何支撑他们的东西了。然后，他们就像失去支撑的重物，或剪掉翅膀的飞鸟一样直坠深渊。由此明显可知，交流可能从他们那里被夺走。</p>

For now I would put forth My hand. That this signifies that all communication might be taken away, is evident from the signification of "hand," as being power (see n. 4931-4937, 6292, 6947, 7188, 7189, 
7518); and of "the hand of Jehovah," as being omnipotence (n. 878, 3387, 7518). Hence "to put forth the hand" denotes to show power, and from omnipotence to do it. This omnipotence is described by 
his being able "to send all plagues into his heart, into his servants, and into his people," whereby is signified that all evils would rush in together, and thus that communication with the things of 
heaven would be taken away. It is this exercise of power that is here signified by these words. How the case is with this communication has already been told, namely, that those who infest the upright 
in the other life are such as in the world have been in the church and have read the Word, and have known the doctrinal things of faith of their church and have also professed them, but have lived a 
life of evil. So long as such in the other life retain the things of faith, they have communication with heaven, and so long they cannot be cast down into hell; and therefore it is these things that are 
by degrees taken away from them; and after these have been taken away, the evil no longer have anything to hold them up; but then like weights without support, or like birds with their wings cut off, 
they fall downward, or into the deep. From all this it is evident what is meant by the possibility of the communication being taken away from them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7545</b></p><p><b>7545.</b>
'For now I could stretch out My hand' means that [all] communication could be taken away. This is clear from the meaning of 'hand' as power, dealt with in <a href="4931.htm">4931</a>-<a href="4937.htm">4937</a>, <a href="6292.htm">6292</a>, <a href="6947.htm">6947</a>, <a href="7188.htm">7188</a>, <a href="7189.htm">7189</a>, <a href="7518.htm">7518</a>, and 
'the hand of Jehovah' as almighty power, <a href="878.htm">878</a>, <a href="3387.htm">3387</a>, <a href="7518.htm">7518</a>. Consequently 'stretching out the hand' means demonstrating power, and doing so by an almighty power. That almighty power is described when Jehovah 
says that it would be possible for Him to send all the plagues onto Pharaoh's heart, his servants, and his people, meaning that the evils could rush in all together, and so communication or contact 
with the things of heaven could be taken away. Such a demonstration of power is what is meant by the words that appear here. The situation with that communication has been spoken of previously. That 
is to say, it was shown previously that those who molest the upright in the next life are those who in the world were part of the Church, read the Word, knew the teachings of the faith of their Church, 
and also claimed to believe them, yet led an evil life. In the next life as long as they keep possession of those matters of faith they remain in contact with heaven and cannot be cast down into 
hell. Therefore those things are taken away from them in stages; and when they have been taken away those people no longer have anything to hold them up. Like weights without supports or like birds with 
their wings cut off they then fall straight down into the abyss. All this shows what is meant by the explanation that communication could be taken away from them. </p>

`Quia nunc mitterem manum Meam': quod significet quod communicatio adimi posset, constat ex significatione `manus' quod sit potentia, de qua n. 4931-4937, 6292, 6947, 7188, 7189, 7518; et quod `manus 
Jehovae' sit omnipotentia, n. 878, 3387, 7518; inde `mittere manum' est ostendere potentiam, {1}et ex omnipotentia id facere; omnipotentia illa describitur per quod `mittere posset omnes plagas in cor 
ejus, in servos ejus, et in populum ejus,' per quae significatur quod omnia mala simul irruerent, et sic quod communicatio adimeretur cum illis quae caeli sunt; hoc {2} (x)potentiae est quod hic per 
illa verba significatur.  Quomodo cum communicatione hac se habet, prius dictum est: quod nempe illi qui probos in altera vita infestant sint qui in mundo in Ecclesia fuerunt, ac legerunt Verbum, et 
sciverunt doctrinalia fidei Ecclesiae suae, et quoque professi illa, sed vixerunt vitam mali; illi in altera vita, quamdiu retinent illa quae fidei sunt, communicationem habent cum caelo, et tamdiu non 
possunt dejici in infernum; {3}quapropter illa sunt quae per gradus illis auferuntur; quae cum ablata sunt, non amplius habent quod elevatos illos teneat; sed tunc sicut pondera absque sustentaculis, 
vel sicut aves abscissis alis deorsum seu in profundum decidunt; ex his patet quid intelligitur per quod communicatio illis adimi posset. 	@1 potentia quae ostendi posset$ 	@2 i itaque$ 	@3 quare$ </p>
