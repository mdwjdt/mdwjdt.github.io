<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1299节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1299.</strong>“又拿沥青当灰泥”他们用源于恶欲的邪恶代替良善。这从圣言中“沥青”和“灰泥”的含义清楚可知。由于此处所论述的主题是巴别塔的建造，故所提及的材料是建筑用的那类。这里之所以提到沥青，是因为它含有硫磺，易燃。在圣言中，此类事物表恶欲，主要表那些属于我欲的恶欲。“沥青”在此既表源于恶欲的邪恶，也表由此产生的虚假；这些也是来自所建巴别塔的邪恶，后面会论述这塔。所表示的是这类事物，这明显可见于以赛亚书：<br />因耶和华有报仇之日，以东的河水要变为沥青，尘埃要变为硫磺，地土成为烧着的沥青。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛34.8.htm">34:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛34.9.htm">9</a>）<br />“沥青”和“硫磺”表源于恶欲的虚假和邪恶。除此之外还有很多类似经文。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1299.</strong> The fact that tar they had in place of mortar means that they had the evil they craved, instead of goodness, can be seen from the symbolism of tar and the symbolism of mortar, or clay, in the Word.{*1} Since the theme here is the building of the Babylonian tower, building materials are used to express the message. Tar is sulfurous and flammable, and in the Word sulfur and fire symbolize cravings, especially those that come of self-love. So tar here symbolizes the evil they craved, as well as the resulting falsity, which is also an evil. These went into the construction of the tower described in the next verses. It can be seen in Isaiah that this is the symbolism:<br />A day of vengeance for Jehovah! [Zion's] watercourses will turn into pitch, and its dirt into sulfur, and its land will become burning pitch. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1299/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_34_8-9" target=_top>Isaiah 34:8-9</a>)<br />The pitch and sulfur stand for the falsity and evil associated with our cravings. There are other instances elsewhere.{*2} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the symbolism of tar, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1299/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1666" target=_top>1666</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1299/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1688" target=_top>1688</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1299/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6724" target=_top>6724</a>; on that of clay, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1299/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1300" target=_top>1300</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1299/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6669" target=_top>6669</a>.

And bitumen had they for mortar. That this signifies that they had the evil of cupidity instead of good, is evident from the signification in the Word of "bitumen" and of "mortar." As the subject here 
treated of is the building of the Babylonish tower, such things are set forth as are used in building; here, bitumen, because it is sulfurous* and inflammable, and in the Word by such things there are 
signified cupidities, especially those which belong to the love of self. Here, "bitumen" signifies both the evils of cupidities and the derivative falsities; which also are the evils wherewith the 
tower was built; concerning which hereafter. That such things are signified, is evident in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The day of vengeance of Jehovah; the torrents shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof 
into sulfur, and the land thereof shall be burning pitch (Isa. 34:8-9). "Pitch" and "sulfur" denote the falsities and evils of cupidities. And so in other places. * Swedenborg uses the term "sulfureous" 
in the sense of combustible, and includes under the term "sulfur" other fiery, inflammable, and combustible products, such as resin. Shakespeare has a similar usage. And to this day the miners in 
coal-pits use the term in much the same way, speaking of the inflammable gas therein as "sulfur." [Reviser.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1299</b></p><p><b>1299.</b>
'They had bitumen for clay' means that they had evil springing from evil desire in place of good. This is clear from the meaning in the Word of 'bitumen' and of 'clay'. Since the subject here is the 
building of the tower of Babel, the materials mentioned are such as are used in building. Bitumen is mentioned because of its sulphurous and combustible qualities, which in the Word mean evil desires, 
chiefly those that belong to self-love. Here 'bitumen' means the evils springing from evil desires, as well as the resulting falsities, as these too are the evils from which the tower described below 
was constructed. That such things are meant is clear in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The day of Jehovah's vengeance - her streams will be turned into pitch, and her dust into sulphur; and her land will become burning 
pitch. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2034:8,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 34:8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Pitch' and 'sulphur' stand for falsities and evils that spring from evil desires. And there are further examples besides these. </p>

Quod 'bitumen fuit iis pro luto' significet quod malum cupiditatis pro bono, constat ex significatione 'bituminis' et ex significatione 'luti' in Verbo: hic quia agitur de aedificatione tum Babylonicae, 
praedicantur talia quae aedificationi inserviunt, tu bitumen quia sulphureum et igneum, quibus significantur in Verbo cupiditates imprimis quae sunt amoris sui; hic per 'bitumen' mala cupiditatum 
ut et falsa inde, quae etiam sunt mala quibus turris, de qua in sequentibus, exstruitur; quod talia significentur, constat apud Esaiam, 	Dies ultionis Jehovae;... convertentur torrentes ejus in picem, 
et pulvis ejus in sulphur; et erit terra ejus in picem ardentem, xxxiv 8, 9; </p>
<p>'pix et sulphur' pro falsis et malis cupiditatum: praeter alibi. </p>
