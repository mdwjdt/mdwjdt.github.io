<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10638节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10638</strong>.“看哪，我要从你面前撵出亚摩利人、迦南人、赫人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人”表那么就移开邪恶和由它们所产生的虚假。这从“从面前撵出”的含义和迦南地民族的代表清楚可知。“从面前撵出”是指从构成思维和情感的内层那里移开某种东西，因为“撵出”表示移开某种东西，而“面（即脸）”表示内层事物（可参看<a href="9546.htm">9546</a>节提到的地方）；人的内层就是存在于他的理解力和意愿，或思维和情感中的事物；因此，“从面前撵出”是指从这些内层那里移开（邪恶和虚假）。迦南地的各个民族是指邪恶和虚假（参看<a href="9327.htm">9327</a>节提到的地方）。至于每个民族具体代表哪种邪恶或虚假，可参看论述它们的地方的解释；如“亚摩利人”表示什么（<a href="6306.htm">6306</a>，<a href="6859.htm">6859</a>节）；“迦南人”表示什么（<a href="1573.htm">1573</a>，<a href="1574.htm">1574</a>，<a href="4818.htm">4818</a>节）；“赫人”表示什么（<a href="2913.htm">2913</a>，<a href="6858.htm">6858</a>节）；“比利洗人”表示什么（<a href="1573.htm">1573</a>，<a href="1574.htm">1574</a>，<a href="6859.htm">6859</a>节）；“希未人、耶布斯人”表示什么（<a href="6860.htm">6860</a>节）。但这些事物论及圣言，是因为这些民族要在他面前被撵出的“摩西”代表圣言，这从前文可以看出来。<br />必须简要说明此处是何情形。当经上说，如果摩西遵守耶和华所吩咐的，祂就会这些民族从他面前撵出去时，意思是说，如果他们执行永恒真理所规定的首要诫命，邪恶和虚假就会被移开。这些诫命就是内义上接下来的事，主要是：他们不可承认除主以外的任何别神，要承认主是一切良善和真理的源头，还要承认救恩和永生来自祂。对那些相信这些事，并喜欢它们是真理的人来说，当他们在阅读圣言时，一切邪恶和虚假就都从他们那里被移开，因为那时主光照并引领他们。而且那时，他们所思想的并非源于他们自己，他们对圣言的情感也不是源于他们自己，而是源于主。因此，邪恶或虚假根本不会进入，因为主会把它们移开。他们就是那些理解圣言，并对源于圣言的真理拥有一种情感，也喜欢照这些真理生活的人。<br />但那些不承认永恒真理所规定的这些主要诫命的人在阅读圣言时接受不到任何光照，因而不倚靠主的帮助来看到那里的真理。相反，他们所看到的事物，都是出于自我看到的；当人们出于自我看见事物时，他们看到的是虚假，而不是真理，即便看见真理，他们也会通过自己所采纳原则或观念，或通过他们将真理转向，从而附着上去的自己的爱而歪曲真理，由此产生邪恶的虚假。这些就是本节的这些话在内义上所表示的事。之所以表示这些事，是因为当世人阅读圣言时，理解圣言内义的天使不知道摩西是什么，也不知道亚摩利人、迦南人、赫人、比利洗人、希未人和耶布斯人是什么，因为名字不会进入天堂，只有它们所表示的真实事物才能进入，因此在那里，摩西被理解为圣言，这些民族被理解为邪恶和虚假。</p>

Behold, I drive out from thy faces the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. That this signifies the removal then of evils and of the falsities 
thence derived, is evident from the signification of "driving out from the faces," as being to remove from the interiors that belong to the thought and the affection; for "to drive out" denotes to 
remove; and the "faces" denote the interiors (as may be seen at the places cited in n. 9546), and the interiors of man are those things which belong to his understanding and his will, or which belong 
to his thought and affection; consequently "to drive out from the faces" denotes to remove from these interiors; and from the representation of the nations in the land of Canaan, as being evils and 
falsities (see at the places cited in n. 9327). But what evil and falsity is represented by each nation may be seen in the explications where they are treated of; as what by the Amorite (n. 6306, 6859); 
what by the Canaanite (n. 1573, 1574, 4818); by the Hittite (n. 2913, 6858); by the Perizzite (n. 1573, 1574, 6859); by the Hivite and the Jebusite (n. 6860). But these things are said of the Word, 
because by Moses, from before whose faces these nations were to be driven out, is represented the Word, as can be seen from what goes before. [2] How the case herein is shall be briefly told. It is 
said that if Moses' people observe that which Jehovah commands, He will drive out these nations from their faces, by which is signified that if they do the primary precepts which are of the eternal truth, 
evils and falsities will be removed. These precepts are the things which follow in the internal sense, the chief of which are that they should not acknowledge any other god than the Lord; and that 
from Him is all good and truth; and also that salvation and eternal life are from Him. With those who believe these things, and love it to be so, all evil and falsity are removed while they are reading 
the Word, because the Lord then enlightens them and leads them. And then they do not think from themselves, nor are they affected by the Word from themselves, but from the Lord; consequently no evil 
and falsity of evil enter, because the Lord removes these. These are they who understand the Word, and are affected by the truths from it, and also love to live according to them.  [3] But those who 
do not acknowledge these chief precepts, which are of the eternal truth, are not enlightened when they read the Word, thus do not from the Lord see the truths therein; but what they see they see from 
self, and to see from self is to see falsities instead of truths. And if they see truths, they nevertheless falsify them by means of principles adopted by themselves; or else by means of their own 
loves, to which they turn the truths, and to which they thus apply them, whence come falsities of evil. These are the things which are signified by these words in the internal sense. The reason why these 
things are signified, is that the angels, who perceive the Word in its internal sense when it is being read by man, do not know what Moses is, nor what the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the 
Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite are, for names do not enter into heaven, but the things which are signified by them, thus by Moses the Word, and by these nations evils and falsities. </p>

'Behold, I am driving out from [before] your face the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite' means the moving away then of evils and the falsities 
arising from them. This is clear from the meaning of 'driving out from [before] the face' as moving or shifting something away from the interiors composing thought and affection (for 'driving out' 
means moving or shifting something away, while 'the face' means interior things, see in the places referred to in <a href="9546.htm">9546</a>; and the interiors of a human being are the things present in his understanding 
and will, or thought and affection, so that 'driving out from the face' means moving [evils and falsities] away from these); and from the representation of the nations in the land of Canaan as evils 
and falsities, dealt with in the places referred to in <a href="9327.htm">9327</a>. But as regards which particular evil or falsity is represented by each nation, see in explanations where they are the subject; that is, for 
what 'the Amorite' means, see <a href="6306.htm">6306</a>, <a href="6859.htm">6859</a>; for what 'the Canaanite' means, <a href="1573.htm">1573</a>, <a href="1574.htm">1574</a>, <a href="4818.htm">4818</a>; for what 'the Hittite' means, <a href="2913.htm">2913</a>, <a href="6858.htm">6858</a>; for what 'the Perizzite' means, <a href="1573.htm">1573</a>, <a href="1574.htm">1574</a>, <a href="6859.htm">6859</a>; and for what 
'the Hivite' and 'the Jebusite' mean, <a href="6860.htm">6860</a>. But these things are said in regard to the Word, for 'Moses', from whose face those nations were to be driven out, represents the Word, as may be recognized 
from what has gone before.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The implications of all this must be stated briefly. When it says that if he observed what Jehovah commanded He would drive out those nations from [before] his face 
the meaning is, If they carried out the chief commands laid down by eternal truth evils and falsities would be moved or shifted away. Those commands are what come next in the internal sense, the main 
ones being that they should acknowledge no other God than the Lord, that He is the Source of everything good and everything true, and also that salvation and eternal life come from Him. And when people 
who believe these things and love the truth of them are reading the Word everything evil and false is shifted away from them, because at that time the Lord enlightens them and leads them. At that time 
also what they think does not originate in themselves, nor does their affection for the Word originate in themselves but in the Lord. Consequently no evil at all or falsity of evil comes in, for the 
Lord moves them away. These are the ones who understand the Word, have an affection for the truths derived from it, and also love to live in accord with them.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But when people who do not acknowledge 
those main commands laid down by eternal truth read the Word they do not receive any enlightenment, and so do not rely on the Lord's help to see the truths there. Instead the things which they 
see they see all by themselves; and when people see things all by themselves they see falsities instead of truths, or if they do see truths they nevertheless falsify them by means of ideas of their 
own which they have adopted, or by means of their selfish loves to which they direct and so attach the truths, from which falsities of evil result. These are the things which are meant in the internal 
sense by the words of the present verse. The reason why those things are meant is that angels who understand the Word in its internal sense when someone in the world reads it do not become aware of Moses, 
nor of the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, for no names pass into heaven, only the realities meant by them, so that by Moses the Word is understood 
there, and by those nations evils and falsities.  </p>

`Ecce Ego expellens a faciebus tuis Emorritam, et Canaanitam, et Chittitam, et Perisitam, et Chivitam, et Jebusitam':  quod significet remotionem tunc malorum et inde falsorum, constat ex significatione 
`expellere a faciebus' quod sit removere ab interioribus, quae sunt cogitationis et affectionis; `expellere' enim est removere, et `facies' sunt interiora, videatur in locis citatis n. 9546, (c)ac 
interiora hominis sunt quae intellectus et voluntatis ejus, seu quae sunt cogitationis et affectionis; inde `expellere a faciebus' est removere (c)ab illis; et ex repraesentatione gentium in terra Canaane, 
quod sint mala et falsa, de qua in locis citatis n. 9327 {1}, sed quodnam malum et falsum per quamlibet gentem repraesentatur, videatur in explicationibus ubi de illis actum est, (d)ut quid per 
Emorritam, n. 6306, 6859, quid per Canaanitam, n. 1573, 1574, 4818, per Chittitam, n. 2913, 6858, per Perisitam, n. 1573, 1574, 6859, per Chivitam {2} et {3} Jebusitam, n. 6860.  Sed haec dicuntur de 
Verbo, quoniam per Moschen, a cujus faciebus gentes illae expellendae {4}erant, repraesentatur Verbum, ut ex praecedentibus constare potest. 	[2] Quomodo cum his se habet, paucis dicetur:  dicitur 
si {5}custodiret sibi quod Jehovah praecipit {6}, quod expelleret a faciebus ejus gentes illas, per quae significatur, si fecerint primaria praecepta quae sunt aeternae veritatis, quod removerentur mala 
et {7} falsa; praecepta illa sunt quae sequuntur in sensu interno, quorum praecipua sunt quod non alium Deum agnoscerent quam Dominum, et quod ab Ipso omne bonum et omne verum, tum quod salus ac vita 
aeterna ab Ipso; apud illos qui haec credunt, et amant quod ita sit, omne malum et falsum removetur dum legunt Verbum, quoniam Dominus tunc illustrat illos ac ducit illos; et tunc non cogitant ex se, 
nec afficiuntur Verbo ex se sed ex Domino, inde non aliquid {8}malum et falsum mali intrat, Dominus enim removet illa; hi sunt qui intelligunt Verbum, et afficiuntur veris inde, et quoque amant vivere 
secundum illa. 	[3] At qui praecipua illa praecepta quae sunt aeternae veritatis, non agnoscunt, illi cum legunt Verbum, non illustrantur, ita non a Domino vident ibi vera, sed quae vident a semet 
vident, et a semet videre est videre falsa pro veris, et si vident vera usque falsificant illa per principia a semet capta, vel per amores proprios, ad quos vera vertunt, et quibus sic illa inapplicant, 
inde falsa mali.  Haec sunt quae in sensu interno per illa verba significantur; quod haec significentur, est quia angeli, qui Verbum in sensu ejus interno percipiunt, cum legitur ab homine, non sciunt 
quid Moscheh, nec quid Emorita, Canaanita, Chittita, Perisita,  Chivita, et Jebusita, nomina enim non intrant caelum sed res quae per illa significantur, ita per Moschen Verbum, et per gentes illas
