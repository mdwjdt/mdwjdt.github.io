<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10770</strong>.那时田地也出现了，它们因庄稼快要熟了而正在变白。天使看到了这种庄稼的种子或谷粒，它们就像中国小麦的麦粒。他们还看到由这种谷粒做成的面包，这些面包很小，被切成方块。此外，那里也出现了开满鲜花的草原，以及果实像石榴的树木；还有灌木，这些灌木不是葡萄树，却结出了可以酿酒的浆果。</p>

There appeared also fields then whitening with the nearly ripe harvest. The seeds or grains of this harvest were shown, which were like the grains of Chinese wheat. Loaves of bread also were shown made 
from this grain, which were small and [formed] in square pieces. There also appeared grassy plains with flowers on them; and also trees that bore a fruit like pomegranates; and also plantations that 
were not grapevines, but yet bore berries from which they prepare wine. </p>

Fields also appeared then, which were becoming white with a harvest almost ripe. The angels were shown the seeds or grains of that harvest; these were like grains of Chinese wheat. They were also shown 
loaves made from them, which were small and broke into square pieces. In addition grassy plains with flowers appeared there, also trees with fruits that were like pomegranates, and bushes too, which 
were not vines but nevertheless bore berries from which they make wine.  </p>

Apparebant etiam agri tunc albescentes ex messe paene matura; ostensa sunt semina seu grana istius messis, quae similia erant granis tritici Chinensis; ostensi etiam sunt panes ex illis, qui parvi in 
frustis quadratis.  Praeterea etiam apparebant campi graminei cum floribus ibi, et quoque arbores cum fructibus qui similes malogranatis, tum arbusta, quae non vites, sed usque ferentia bacas, ex quibus 
vinum praeparant. </p>
