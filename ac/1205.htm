<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1205节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1205.</strong>“耶布斯人、亚摩利人、革迦撒人、希未人、亚基人、西尼人、亚瓦底人、洗玛利人、哈马人”是指众多民族，他们还表众多不同的偶像崇拜，这些民族表偶像崇拜的形式。这从圣言的很多地方清楚看出来，因为他们是迦南陆地的居民，由于自己的偶像崇拜而被丢弃，一部分被灭绝。但就圣言的内义而言，他们并非指这些民族，而表示总体上的偶像崇拜本身，无论是谁的，也无论是哪里的；尤表犹太人中的偶像崇拜。因为他们使敬拜纯由外在构成，完全不愿知道内在事物，当被教导时，就拒绝接受，反而热衷于所有这些偶像崇拜，这可从犹太人明显看出来。唯独内在敬拜才有使人退离偶像崇拜的约束；一旦这些约束不复存在，就再没有拉住他的东西了。然而，偶像崇拜也有内在和外在之分。那些具有缺乏内在的外在敬拜之人会冲向外在偶像崇拜；而那些具有污秽内在的外在敬拜之人则会冲向内在偶像崇拜；这些民族同样表示这两种偶像崇拜。内在偶像崇拜是人所热爱和崇拜的众多虚假和恶欲，它们就这样取代了外邦人中所存在的神明和偶像。不过，至于人所崇拜和这些民族，就是耶布斯人、亚摩利人、革迦撒人、希未人、亚基人、西尼人、亚瓦底人、洗玛利人、哈马人所表示的具体虚假和恶欲，这解释起来过于冗长。蒙主怜悯，这一切会在出现这些名字的地方予以讨论。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1205.</strong> The Jebusite, Amorite, Girgashite, Hivite, Arkite, Sinite, Arvadite, Zemarite, Hamathite were individual nations that also symbolize individual idolatries of different sorts. The fact that those nations symbolize idolatries is evident from many places in the Word, because they were inhabitants of the land of Canaan, who were rejected on account of their idolatries, and of whom a portion was eradicated. But in the Word's inner sense, they do not symbolize the nations but the idolatries themselves. In general they symbolize idolatry wherever it exists; the specific reference is to idolatry among the Jews [of that time].<br />There are people who view worship as consisting solely in outward acts, who flatly refuse to hear about inward elements and reject the very idea when they are taught about it. Such people are strongly drawn to all these types of idolatry, as is strikingly clear from the [Old Testament] Jews. Only in internal worship is there a bond that can hold us back from idolatry. When it breaks, there is nothing left to stop us.<br />Idolatry, however, comes not only in shallow forms but in deeper forms as well. Superficial types of idolatry attract those practicing an outward worship devoid of inner devotion. The deeper forms of idolatry attract those practicing an outward worship in which the inner depths are foul. Both kinds are equally symbolized by these nations. Inward idolatries are simply so many falsities and impure desires that we love and adulate, which means that they stand in the place of the gods and idols that existed among non-Jewish nations. But explaining exactly which falsities and cravings are adulated [by the various people] symbolized by these nations — the Jebusite, Amorite, Girgashite, Hivite, Arkite, Sinite, Arvadite, Zemarite, and Hamathite — would take too long here. By the Lord's divine mercy, it will be told in the individual places where their names come up.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Some of these nations are not mentioned elsewhere in Scripture except in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1205/bible_king-james-version_1-chronicles_1_14-16" target=_top>1 Chronicles 1:14-16</a> (where <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1205/bible_king-james-version_genesis_10_16-18" target=_top>Genesis 10:16-18</a> is repeated word for word), and Secrets of Heaven does not extend beyond Exodus. (On the implicit promises in Secrets of Heaven to treat biblical books beyond Exodus, see note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1205/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3" target=_top>3</a> there.) At any rate, there seems to be no other place where Swedenborg explains the meanings of the last five nations listed. The negative symbolism of Jebusites may be found in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1205/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6860" target=_top>6860</a>; that of Amorites in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1205/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1857" target=_top>1857:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1205/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6306" target=_top>6306:1-4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1205/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6859" target=_top>6859</a>; that of Girgashites in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1205/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1867" target=_top>1867</a>; and that of Hivites in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1205/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6860" target=_top>6860</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1205/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_9332" target=_top>9332</a>. (In addition, Swedenborg assigns Hivites a good meaning in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1205/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4431" target=_top>4431</a>.)

The Jebusite, Amorite, Girgashite, Hivite, Arkite, Sinite, Arvadite, Zemarite, and Hamathite, were so many nations, and they also signify so many different idolatries. That idolatries were signified 
by these nations, is evident from many places in the Word, for they were the inhabitants of the land of Canaan who on account of their idolatries were cast out, and in part extirpated. But in the internal 
sense of the Word these nations are not signified, but the idolatries themselves in general, with whomsoever and wheresoever they are; specifically, among the Jews. For they who make worship consist 
merely in externals, and are entirely unwilling to know internal things, and when instructed reject them, are very prone to all these idolatries, as is clearly manifest from the Jews. In internal 
worship alone is there a bond that withholds man from idolatry; and when this ceases, there is nothing that restrains. There are however interior idolatries, as well as external ones. They who have external 
worship without internal rush into external idolatries; they who have external worship whose interiors are unclean rush into interior idolatries; and both these kinds of idolatries are signified 
by these nations. Interior idolatries are so many falsities and cupidities which men love and adore, and which are thus in place of the gods and idols that existed among the Gentiles. But what particular 
kinds of falsities and cupidities are those which are adored, and which are signified by these nations-the Jebusite, Amorite, Girgashite, Hivite, Arkite, Sinite, Arvadite, Zemarite, and Hamathite-it 
would take too long to explain here; but of the Lord's Divine mercy it will be told in the places where their names occur. </p>

That 'the Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites, Hivites, Arkites, Sinites, Arvadites, Zemarites, and Hamathites' were just so many nations, who also mean just so many different forms of idolatry, and that 
those nations mean forms of idolatry, is clear from many places in the Word, for they were inhabitants of the land of Canaan who on account of their idolatry were rejected and partially destroyed. In 
the internal sense of the Word however it is not those nations that are meant but the forms of idolatry themselves - in general as they exist anywhere at all, and in particular among the Jews. For people 
who make worship consist solely in externals and have no wish at all to learn of internals, and who when instructed reject them, incline very much to all these forms of idolatry, as is all too clear 
in the case of the Jews. internal worship alone holds within it the bonds that keep a person back from idolatry, and once those bonds cease to exist there is nothing to hold him back. There are however 
not only external forms of idolatry but also interior. Into external forms of idolatry rush those people who possess external worship devoid of internal, and into interior forms those people rush 
possessing external worship whose interiors are foul. These forms of idolatry are likewise meant by these nations. Interior forms of idolatry are just so many falsities and evil desires which they 
love and adore and which thus take the place of the gods and idols which existed among gentile nations. It would take too long to explain here however which particular falsities and evil desires they 
are that people adore and which are meant by these nations - by the Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites, Hivites, Arkites, Sinites, Arvadites, Zemarites, and Hamathites. In the Lord's Divine mercy this will 
be discussed in the places where these names occur. </p>

Quod 'Jebusi, Emori, Girgashi, Hivi, Arki, Sini, Arvadi, Zemari, Hamathi' fuerint totidem gentes, et quod per eas significentur etiam totidem diversae idololatriae; quod idololatriae per gentes istas 
significentur, constat a pluribus in Verbo; fuerunt enim incolae terrae Canaanis, qui propter idololatrias rejecti, et partim exstirpati fuerunt; sed in interno sensu Verbi non significantur gentes 
istae sed ipsae idololatriae, in genere apud quoscumque ubi sunt, in specie apud Judaeos:  qui enim in externis solummodo cultum ponunt et prorsus nescire volunt interna, cumque instruuntur, rejiciunt, 
ii ad omnes has idololatrias pronissimi sunt, sicut luculenter constat a Judaeis:  in interno cultu solum est vinculum quod detinet hominem ab idololatria, quo cessante, nihil est quod inhibet:  sed 
sunt idololatriae non solum externae, verum etiam interiores; in idololatrias externas ruunt ii qui cultum externum absque interno habent; in idololatrias interiores ii qui cultum externum habent cujus 
interiora sunt foeda; quae idololatriae pariter significantur per has gentes; idololatriae interiores sunt totidem falsitates et cupiditates quas amant, adorant, et sic sunt loco deorum et idolorum 
quae fuerunt apud gentes; sed quaenam falsitates et cupiditates sunt quae adorantur, per gentes has, nempe Jebusi, Emori, Girgashi, Hivi, Arki, Sini, Arvadi, Zemari et Hamathi, significantur, prolixum 
foret hic exponere; suis locis ubi occurrunt, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, dicetur. </p>
