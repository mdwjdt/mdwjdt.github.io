<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1910节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1910.</strong>“夏甲就怀了孕”表理性的最初生命。这从“怀孕”的含义清楚可知，“怀孕”表示最初的生命。就理性而言，如前所述，它通过内在人的生命接受其生命，而它的生命则流入外层人中认知和知识情感的生命。认知和知识情感的生命可以说为理性提供一个身体，或给内在人的生命披上衣服，如同肉体给灵魂披上衣服，因为这与认知和知识的情形一样。灵魂与肉体的观念或形像存在于属乎人的每一部分中，存在于其情感的每一部分和思维的每一部分中。因为无论看似多么简单，没有一物不构成部分，并由在它之先的事物产生。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1910</b></p><p><b>1910.</b>
And she conceived. That this signifies the first life of the rational, is evident from the signification of "conception," as being the first life. As regards the rational, it receives its life, as before 
said, from the life of the internal man flowing into the life of the affection of knowledges [cognitiones et scientiae] in the exterior man. The life of the affection of these knowledges gives a 
sort of body to the rational, or clothes the life of the internal man as the body clothes the soul; for this is precisely the case with these knowledges. In everything appertaining to man, in everything 
of his affection and in everything of his thought, there is the idea or likeness of soul and body, for there is nothing, however simple it may appear, that is not composite, and that does not come 
forth from what is prior to itself.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1910</b></p><p><b>1910.</b>
'And she conceived' means the initial life of the rational. This is clear from the meaning of 'conception' as initial life. As regards the rational, this receives its life, as has been stated, from the 
life that belongs to the internal man, and is life flowing into the life of the exterior man's affection for cognitions and knowledge. The life of the affection for cognitions and knowledge provides 
the rational so to speak, with a body, that is, it clothes the life of the internal man as the body does the soul. So it is exactly with cognitions and knowledge. The idea or image of soul and body 
exists with a human being in every part of him, in every part of his affection, and in every part of his thinking, for there is nothing, however simple it may appear to be, that does not have constituent 
parts and does not arise from that which is prior to itself. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1910</b>
</p><b>1910.</b>
`Et concepit': quod significet primam vitam rationalis, constat a significatione `conceptionis' quod sit prima vita: quod rationale attinet, hoc vitam suam, ut dictum, accipit a vita interni hominis 
influente in vitam affectionis cognitionum et scientiarum exterioris; vita affectionis cognitionum et scientiarum dat rationali quasi corpus, seu induit vitam interni hominis sicut corpus animam; cognitiones 
et scientiae non aliter se habent: idea seu instar animae et corporis est in singulis quae apud hominem, in singulis ejus affectionis, et in singulis ejus cogitationis, nam nihil non utcumque 
simplex apparet, est compositum, et existit a priore se. </p>
