<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10646节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10646</strong>.“因为耶和华名为忌妒者，祂是忌妒的神”表若拜别人，神性良善和神性真理就会离开。这从“忌妒者”和“耶和华的名”的含义清楚可知：“忌妒者”是指一个只允许自己，不允许其他任何人被爱和敬拜的人；“耶和华的名”是指藉以敬拜主的一切事物（参看<a href="2724.htm">2724</a>，<a href="3006.htm">3006</a>，<a href="6674.htm">6674</a>，<a href="9310.htm">9310</a>节）。由于这是从主的神性人身发出的神性真理，所以主的神性人身就是“耶和华的名”在至高意义上所表示的（<a href="2628.htm">2628</a>，<a href="6887.htm">6887</a>，<a href="8274.htm">8274</a>节）。神性真理是在天上的主自己，因为从祂发出之物就是祂自己。从神性只能发出神性之物，不可能发出其它任何东西；神性之物为一。由此明显可知，“耶和华名为忌妒者”表示主只允许祂自己，不允许其他任何人受到敬拜，因为唯独主是通向救恩的一切真理和一切良善的源头。主被称为“忌妒者”，是因为一旦别人受到敬拜，一切真理和良善都会离开。事实上，一个人通过来自主的良善和真理与祂联结；因此，一旦别人受到敬拜，这种联结就会中断，虚假就会取代真理，邪恶则取代良善。<br />祂之所以两次被称为“忌妒者”，即耶和华是忌妒者，是忌妒的神，是因为“耶和华”表示神性良善，“神”表示神性真理。在圣言中，凡论述神性良善的地方，主都被称为“耶和华”；而凡论述神性真理的地方，祂都被称为“神”（参看<a href="2586.htm">2586</a>，<a href="2769.htm">2769</a>，<a href="2921.htm">2921</a>，<a href="6303.htm">6303</a>，<a href="6905.htm">6905</a>，<a href="10158.htm">10158</a>，<a href="10617.htm">10617</a>节）。由于当另一个人而不是主受到敬拜时，神性良善和神性真理都会离开一个人，所以祂两次被称为“忌妒者”。<br />经上说唯独主要受到敬拜。人若不知道对主的真正敬拜的性质，可能会以为主喜欢受到敬拜，渴望从人那里得到荣耀，就像一个为了得到别人的尊重而满足别人要求的人。如此思想的人对爱是什么样根本没有任何概念，更不知道神的爱是什么样。神的爱在于为了人和他的拯救，而不是为了祂自己而想要敬拜和荣耀。因为敬拜主并将荣耀归给主的人处于谦卑的状态；人自己的东西会离开处于谦卑状态的人；并且这种东西越离开，神性就越被接受；人自己的东西或自我因是邪恶和虚假，故是唯一阻碍神性的东西。这就是主的荣耀；对祂的敬拜是为了这个目的而存在的。为了自我的荣耀则是由于自我之爱而存在的；但天堂之爱不同于自我之爱，正如天堂不同于地狱，神的爱更是无限不同于自我之爱。</p>

For Jehovah, whose name is Jealous, a jealous God is He. That this signifies that if another is worshiped, the Divine good and Divine truth will depart, is evident from the signification of "Jealous," 
as being one who does not suffer anyone but Himself to be loved and worshiped; and from the signification of the "name of Jehovah," as being everything by means of which the Lord is worshiped (see n. 
2724, 3006, 6674, 9310). And as this is the Divine truth that proceeds from His Divine Human, it is the Divine Human of the Lord which in the supreme sense is meant by the "name of Jehovah" (n. 2628, 
6887, 8274); for the Divine truth is the Lord Himself in heaven, because that which proceeds from Him is Himself. From the Divine, nothing else can proceed than what is Divine, and the Divine is one. 
From this it is evident that by, "whose name is Jealous," is signified that the Lord does not suffer anyone but Himself to be worshiped, because from Him alone come all the truth and all the good whereby 
is salvation. The Lord is called "Jealous" because as soon as another is worshiped, all truth and good depart; for a man is conjoined with the Lord by means of the good and truth which are from 
Him; and therefore as soon as another is worshiped, disjunction takes place, and then falsity succeeds in the place of truth, and evil in the place of good. [2] That He is twice called "jealous" is because 
by "Jehovah" is meant the Divine good, and by "God" the Divine truth. (That in the Word the Lord is called "Jehovah" where the Divine good is treated of, but "God" where the Divine truth is treated 
of, see n. 2586, 2769, 2921, 6303, 6905, 10158, 10617.) And as both the Divine good and the Divine truth depart from a man when another than the Lord is worshiped, He is twice called "jealous."  [3] 
It is said that the Lord alone is to be worshiped. He who does not know how the case is with the worship of the Lord, may believe that the Lord loves to be worshiped, and desires glory from man, 
just like a man, who in order to be honored himself, gives others what they ask for. He who so believes has no knowledge of what love is, and still less of what love Divine is. Love Divine consists in 
desiring worship and glory, not for the sake of itself, but for the sake of man and his salvation; for he who worships the Lord and gives glory to the Lord is in humiliation; and what is his own departs 
from the man who is in humiliation; and insofar as this departs, so far the Divine is received; for what is man's own, because it is evil and false, is that which alone obstructs the Divine. This 
is the glory of the Lord; and the worship of Him is for the sake of this end. Glory for the sake of self is from the love of self, and heavenly love differs from the love of self as heaven differs from 
hell, and infinitely more does the Divine love differ from it. </p>

'For Jehovah the Jealous One is His name, God the Jealous One is He' means that if any other is worshipped Divine Good and Divine Truth depart. This is clear from the meaning of 'a jealous one' as somebody 
who does not allow anyone other than himself to be loved and worshipped; and from the meaning of 'Jehovah's name' as everything by means of which the Lord is worshipped, dealt with in <a href="2724.htm">2724</a>, <a href="3006.htm">3006</a>, <a href="6674.htm">6674</a>, <a href="9310.htm">9310</a>. And since this is Divine Truth emanating from His Divine Human, the Lord's Divine Human is what 'Jehovah's name' is used to mean in the highest sense, <a href="2628.htm">2628</a>, <a href="6887.htm">6887</a>, <a href="8274.htm">8274</a>. Divine Truth is 
the Lord Himself as He exists in heaven; for what emanates from Him is Himself. From the Divine nothing other than what is Divine can emanate; and what is Divine is one. From this it is evident that 'the 
Jealous One is His name' means that the Lord does not allow anyone other than Himself to be worshipped, because He alone is the Source of all the truth and all the good that lead to salvation. The 
Lord is called the Jealous One because as soon as any other is worshipped all truth and good depart. For goodness and truth, of which the Lord is the Source, are the means by which a person is linked 
to Him; therefore as soon as another is worshipped the link is severed, and falsity replaces truth and evil  replaces good.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why He is called the Jealous One twice - Jehovah the Jealous 
One and God the Jealous One - is that Jehovah is used to mean Divine Good and God to mean Divine Truth. (In the Word the Lord is called Jehovah where Divine Good is the subject, but He is called 
God where Divine Truth is the subject, see <a href="2586.htm">2586</a>, <a href="2769.htm">2769</a>, <a href="2921.htm">2921</a>, <a href="6303.htm">6303</a>, <a href="6905.htm">6905</a>, <a href="10158.htm">10158</a>, <a href="10617.htm">10617</a>.) And since both depart from a person when someone other than the Lord is worshipped He is called the Jealous One 
twice.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 It is said that the Lord alone is to be worshipped. Anyone unacquainted with the nature of true worship of the Lord may think that the Lord loves to be worshipped and desires glory from 
people, like someone who grants another person what he requests because that other person pays him respect. Anyone who thinks like that has no idea at all of what love is like, let alone of what God's 
love is like. God in His love does not desire worship and glory for His own sake but for that of man and his salvation. For humility exists in those who worship the Lord and give Him glory, and from 
those in whom humility exists the proprium or what belongs to self departs. And so far as this departs, the Divine is received; for the proprium or self, being evil and false, is the one thing that 
stands in the way of the Divine. This is the glory of the Lord, and worship of Him exists to that end. Glory for the sake of self exists as a result of self-love; but heavenly love, and infinitely more 
so God's love, is as different from self-love as heaven is from hell.  </p>

`Nam jehovah Zelotes nomen Ipsius, {1} Deus Zelotes Ille':  quod significet si alius colitur quod recedat Divinum Bonum et Divinum Verum, constat ex significatione `Zelotis' quod sit qui non patitur 
alium quam semet amari et coli; et ex significatione `nominis jehovae' quod sit omne per quod Dominus colitur, de qua n. 2724, 3006, 6674, 9310; et quia id est Divinum Verum procedens ex Divino Humano 
Ipsius, est Divinum Humanum Domini quod in sensu supremo per `nomen Jehovae' intelligitur, n. 2628, 6887, 8274; nam Divinum Verum est Ipse Dominus in caelo, quod enim procedit ab Ipso est Ipse; ex Divino 
non aliud potest procedere quam Divinum, et Divinum est unum; inde patet quod per `Zelotes nomen Ipsius' significetur quod Dominus non patiatur alium coli quam Semet, quia ab Ipso solo omne verum 
et omne bonum, per quae salus; Dominus Zelotes nominatur, quia ut primum alius colitur, omne verum et bonum recedit, homo enim per {2}bonum et verum, quae ex Domino, conjungitur Ipsi, quare ut primum 
alius colitur, fit disjunctio, et tunc loco veri succedit falsum et loco boni malum {3}. 	[2] Quod bis dicatur Zelotes, nempe Jehovah Zelotes et Deus Zelotes, est quia per Jehovam intelligitur Divinum 
Bonum, et per Deum Divinum Verum; quod in Verbo ubi agitur de Divino Bono, Dominus dicatur Jehovah, ubi autem de Divino Vero, dicatur Deus, videatur n. 2586, 2769, 2921, 6303, 6905, 10158, 10617; 
et quia utrumque recedit ab homine cum alius colitur quam Dominus, ideo bis dicitur Zelotes. 	[3] Dicitur quod Dominus (d)solus colendus sit; qui non scit quomodo cum cultu Domini se habet, credere potest 
quod Dominus amet coli, et velit gloriam ab homine, sicut homo qui alteri dat quod petit propter honorem {4}sibi datum; qui ita credit prorsus non scit quid amor, et adhuc minus quid amor Divinus; 
amor Divinus est velle cultum et velle gloriam non propter se sed propter hominem et ejus salutem, nam qui colit Dominum et {5} gloriam dat Domino, in humiliatione est, et ab illo qui in humiliatione 
est recedit proprium, et quantum hoc recedit tantum recipitur Divinum, proprium enim hominis est quod solum obstat Divino, nam proprium ejus est malum et falsum; haec est gloria Domini, et propter 
illum finem est cultus Ipsius; gloria propter se est ex amore sui, et tantum differt amor caelestis ab amore sui, quantum caelum ab inferno, (c)ac infinite magis amor Divinus. @1 i and d et A,i et IT$ @2
