And he said to Abram, "You must know positively that your seed will be immigrants in a land not theirs; and they will serve [the people of that land], and these will afflict them four hundred years."<br />He said to Abram symbolizes a perception. You must know positively means that it was certain. Your seed will be immigrants means that charity and faith would be rare. In a land that is not theirs symbolizes places where it would not seem as if the church belonged to those who had charity and faith. And they will serve [the people of that land] symbolizes oppression. And these will afflict them means that their trials would be heavy. Four hundred years means however long they would last and what conditions would be like then. </p>

Verse 13. And He said unto Abram, Knowing thou shall know that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them, and they shall afflict them four hundred years. "He said 
unto Abram," signifies a perception; "knowing thou shalt know," signifies that it is certain; "thy seed shall be a stranger," signifies that charity and faith shall be rare; in a land that is not theirs," 
signifies where there is a church that is as it were not composed of those who are in charity and faith; "and they shall serve them," signifies oppression; "and they shall afflict them," signifies 
their severe temptations; "four hundred years," signifies the duration and state. </p>

Church which does not so to speak consist of people in whom faith and charity are present. 'And they will serve them'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> means oppression. 'And these will afflict them' means their grievous temptations. 
'For four hundred years' means the duration and state [of those temptations].

Vers. 13.  Et dixit Abramo, Cognoscendo cognosces, quod peregrinum erit semen tuum in terra, non illis; et servient illis {1}, et affligent illos quadringentis annis. 'Dixit Abramo' significat perceptione 
'Cognoscendo cognosces' significat quod certum: 'peregrinum e semen tuum' significat quod rara charitas et fides: 'in terra quae non illis' significat ubi Ecclesia, sicut non foret illorum qui 
in charitate et fide: 'et servient illis' significat oppressionem: 'et affligent illos' significat tentationes illorum graves: 'quadringentis annis' significat durationem et statum. 	@1 See note p. 730.$ </p>
