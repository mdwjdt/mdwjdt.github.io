<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6948节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6948.</strong>“耶和华说，把它丢在地上。他一丢在地上”表主的神性属世层的能力进入感官层的流注。这从“杖”、“丢”和“地”的含义清楚可知：“杖”是指属世层中的能力，当论及主时，是指从祂的神性属世层发出的能力，如刚才所述（<a href="6947.htm">6947</a>节）；“丢”或“放出”是指发出，因而是指流注；“地”是指人心智的外在部分，或说人的外在（<a href="82.htm">82</a>，<a href="913.htm">913</a>，<a href="1411.htm">1411</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>节），在此是指心智的感官和肉体层，也就是最外层，因为杖变成了一条蛇，而“蛇”表示人心智的感官和肉体层，或感官肉体人。<br />主的神性能力在此是指从主发出的神性真理，因为能力存在于神性真理之中，以致神性真理就是能力本身（<a href="3091.htm">3091</a>，<a href="4931.htm">4931</a>，<a href="6344.htm">6344</a>，<a href="6423.htm">6423</a>节）。从主发出的神性真理流入每个人，通过他的内层流入外层，一直流入外在感官层和肉体层；凡流入之处，它都会激起在自己适当秩序中的相对应的事物；在感官层则激起诸如出现在世界和地上的那类相对应的事物。但是，存在于世界和地上的事物表面上不同于它们原本的样子，所以充满幻觉或谬误。因此，当感官层只依赖于这些表象时，那里的思维不可避免地反对信之良善与真理，因为这思维建立在幻觉或谬误的基础上。当神性真理流入时，感官层必将它转变为虚假。<br />一个人若不上升到感官层之上，而是局限于感官层，那么他的思维就建立在幻觉或谬误的基础上；这一点可通过下面的例子来说明：在人的生命方面存在的幻觉或谬误是，生命属于身体；而事实上，它属于身体里面的灵。在视觉、听觉、言语方面存在的幻觉或谬误是，它们分别属于眼睛、耳朵，舌头和口唇；而事实上，是灵通过这些身体器官在看、听、说。在生命方面存在的幻觉或谬误是，它天生就存在于人里面；而事实上，它流入人里面。在灵界方面存在的幻觉或谬误是，灵魂无法存在于一个人的形式里面，或无法拥有人的感觉和情感。在天堂和地狱方面存在的幻觉或谬误是，前者在人之上，后者在人之下；而事实上，它们在人里面。存在一个从物体到内层的流注，或说物体流入外层，这是一个幻觉或谬误；而事实上，外在之物不会流入内在之物；相反，内在之物流入外在之物。在死后生命方面存在的幻觉或谬误是，生命若没有肉体的存在是不可能的；更不用提涉及自然现象的幻觉或谬误了，这些幻觉或谬误导致许多人作出自相矛盾的猜测。<br />仅从长期以来关于血液循环的争战，谁看不出幻觉或谬误和由此产生的虚假取代真理占据了主导地位？尽管有如此多的明显证据证明血液循环，但它仍在很长一段时间内遭到质疑。幻觉或谬误的这种主导地位也可从关于太阳的争论看出来，太阳每天绕这个地球转，不仅太阳，而且月亮、所有行星，整个星空都绕地球转；这种主导地位同样从在灵魂方面仍旧存在的争论看出来，即：它如何与身体联结，在身体中居于何处。感官幻觉或谬误在这些事上占上风，尽管它们的真正性质从如此多的现象和结果明显看出来，那么它们在诸如属于天堂的那类事上又何等地占上风呢？这些事因是属灵的，故若不通过对应，就不会显明。<br />由此可见，人的感官就其本身并任由它自己而言，是何性质，即：它充满幻觉或谬误，并由此充满虚假，因而反对信之真理真理与良善。这就是为何当人不上升到感官层之上，还在感官层闪耀的低劣之光中看事物时，就灵界的事物，也就是在来自神性的光里面的事物而言，他完全陷入黑暗。当来自天堂的光穿透感官层的低劣之光时，这低劣之光就转变为纯粹的幽暗。原因在于，属于神性之光的真理无法与幻觉或谬误和由此产生的虚假共存；虚假会熄灭或扼杀真理，由此造成幽暗。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6948</b></p><p><b>6948.</b>
And He said, Cast it to the earth. That this signifies the influx of the power of the Lord's Divine natural into the sensuous, is evident from the signification of a "rod," as being power in the natural, 
and when it is said of the Lord, as being the power proceeding from his Divine natural (of which just above, n. 6947) from the signification of "casting," or "sending forth," as being proceeding, 
thus influx; and from the signification of "the earth" as being man's external (n. 82, 913, 1411, 1733), here his sensuous and corporeal, which are the outermosts, because the rod became a serpent, and 
by a "serpent" is signified the sensuous and corporeal man. [2] By the Divine power of the Lord is here meant the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, for there is power in Divine truth, insomuch 
that it is power itself (n. 3091, 4931, 6344, 6423). The Divine truth proceeding from the Lord flows into every man, through his interiors into the exteriors, even into the external sensuous and into 
the corporeal, and calls forth everywhere things correspondent in their order; in the sensuous, things correspondent such as appear in the world and upon the earth. But as the things which are in the 
world and upon the earth appear otherwise than as they are, they are therefore full of fallacies; and therefore when the sensuous is in these evils only, it must needs think against the goods and truths 
of faith, because it thinks from fallacies; and when Divine truth flows in, it must needs turn it into falsity.  [3] That a man who is not elevated from the sensuous, but is in it and thinks from 
it, thinks from fallacies, may be illustrated by examples: The fallacies in respect to the life of man-that it is of the body, when yet it is of the spirit in the body; in respect to the sight-that 
it is of the eye; in respect to the hearing that it is of the ear; in respect to the speech-that it is of the tongue and mouth; when yet it is the spirit which sees, hears, and speaks, through these organs 
of the body. The fallacies in respect to life-that it is permanent in man, when yet it flows in. The fallacies in respect to the soul-that it cannot be in a human form, and in human senses and affections. 
The fallacies in respect to heaven and hell-that the former is above man, and the latter beneath him, when yet they are in him. The fallacies that objects flow into the exteriors, when yet 
what is external does not flow into what is internal, but what is internal into what is external. The fallacies in respect to the life after death-that it is impossible except together with the body. 
Besides the fallacies in natural things, which give rise to the self-contradictory conjectures of so many persons. [4] Who cannot see that fallacies and the falsities thence derived have dominion instead 
of truths, merely from the dispute which long existed in respect to the circulation of the blood, which though supported by so many experimental proofs, nevertheless long remained in doubt; and also 
from the dispute about the sun-that it revolved once a day around this earth, and not only the sun, but also the moon, all the planets, and the whole starry heaven; and also from the dispute which 
still continues in respect to the soul, its conjunction with the body, and its seat therein. Seeing that the fallacies of the senses have dominion in such things, although their true character is plain 
from so many phenomena and effects, why should they not do so in such things as belong to heaven, which being spiritual are not plain except through correspondences? [5] From all this it can now be 
seen what is the quality of man's sensuous, viewed in itself, and left to itself; namely, that it is in fallacies, and thence in falsities, thus is against the truths and goods of faith. Hence it is 
that when man is in the sensuous and in its light, he is in thick darkness in respect to the things of the spiritual world, that is, in respect to those which are in light from the Divine; and that the 
sensuous light is turned into mere thick darkness when the light from heaven falls into it. The reason is, that the truths which are of the Divine light cannot be together with fallacies and the falsities 
thence derived; but [the falsities] extinguish [the truths] and thereby induce thick darkness. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6948</b></p><p><b>6948.</b>
'And He said, Throw it to the earth. And he threw it to the earth' means an influx of the power of the Lord's Divine Natural into the sensory level. This is clear from the meaning of 'rod' as power in 
the natural, and - when used in reference to the Lord - as the power emanating from His Divine Natural, dealt with immediately above in <a href="6947.htm">6947</a>; from the meaning of 'throwing', or sending forth, as emanating, 
which is influx; and from the meaning of 'the earth' as the external part of the human mind, dealt with in <a href="82.htm">82</a>, <a href="917.htm">917</a>, <a href="1411.htm">1411</a>, <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>, here the sensory and bodily levels of it, which are the most external, 
for the rod was made into a serpent and 'a serpent' means the sensory and bodily levels of a person's mind.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 By the Lord's Divine power one should here understand Divine Truth emanating 
from the Lord, for power resides within Divine Truth to such an extent that it is power itself, <a href="3091.htm">3091</a>, <a href="4931.htm">4931</a>, <a href="6344.htm">6344</a>, <a href="6423.htm">6423</a>. Divine Truth emanating from the Lord flows into every person by way of his interiors 
into his exteriors, right down into the external sensory and the bodily levels, and everywhere it flows it stirs to life things attuned to it in their proper order - on the sensory level things attuned 
to it such as appear in the world around and on earth. But things that exist in the world around and on earth are different in appearance from what they really are, and so they are full of illusions. 
When therefore the sensory level relies solely on those appearances<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> the thought which takes place there is inevitably opposed to any good or truth of faith because that thought is based on illusions, 
and when Divine Truth flows in the sensory level turns it into falsity. The fact that a person's thought is based on illusions if he does not rise above the sensory level but confines himself 
to that Level and thinks on it can be demonstrated by the following examples: </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 There are for instance illusions regarding a person's life - that it belongs essentially to the body, when in fact 
it belongs to the spirit within the body. There are illusions about sight, hearing, and speech - that they belong to the eye, ear, tongue and mouth, when in fact the spirit is what sees, hears, and speaks, 
through those organs of the body. Then there are illusions about life - that it is innately present in a person, when in fact it flows into him; and illusions about the soul - that it is unable 
to exist within a human form, or to have human senses and affections. There are also illusions about heaven and hell - that the one is above a person and the other beneath, when in fact they are within 
him; illusions that there is an influx from objects to interior things, when in fact what is external does not flow into what is internal, but what is internal into what is external; illusions about 
life after death - that it is not possible without the presence also of the physical body; not to mention illusions involving natural phenomena which lead to conflicting conjectures made by so many people. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
Can anyone fail to see the predominance of illusions and consequently of falsities over truths simply from the dispute that had gone on for a long time about the circulation of the blood, 
which in spite of so much convincing evidence nevertheless remained open to doubt for a long time? That predominance of illusions may also be recognized from the dispute about the sun, that it revolved 
each day around this earth, and not only the sun but also the moon, all the planets, and the whole starry sky, and from the dispute which continues to exist regarding the soul - how it is joined to 
the body, and where it is seated there. When the illusions of the senses prevail in such matters, even though the true nature of these is evident from so many phenomena and effects, how much more will 
they prevail in the kinds of things that belong to heaven, which, being spiritual ones, do not make themselves plain except by means of correspondences? </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 From all this one may now see what the 
sensory level of a person's mind is like regarded in itself and left to itself - that it is full of illusions and consequently falsities and so is opposed to the truth or good of faith. This is why 
when a person does not rise above the sensory level and sees things in the inferior light which shines on that level he is completely in the dark so far as things belonging to the spiritual world are 
concerned, that is, things which dwell in light from the Divine. And that inferior light on a sensory level is turned into thick and utter darkness when light from heaven penetrates it. The reason for 
this is that truths which belong to Divine light cannot exist together with illusions and consequent falsities; it snuffs them out and in so doing causes thick darkness.

`Et dixit, Projice illum terram; et projecit illum terram': quod significet potentiae Divini Naturalis Domini influxum in sensuale, constat ex significatione `baculi' quod sit potentia in naturali, 
et cum dicitur de Domino, quod sit potentia procedens a Divino Naturali Ipsius, de qua mox supra n. 6947; ex significatione `projicere,' seu emittere, quod sit procedens, ita influxus; et ex significatione 
`terrae' quod sit externum hominis, de qua n. 82, 913, 1411, 1733, hic sensuale et corporeum ejus, quae sunt extrema, quia baculus factus est in serpentem, et per `serpentem' homo sensualis et corporeus 
significatur. 	2 Per potentiam Divinam Domini hic intelligitur Divinum Verum procedens a Domino, nam Divino Vero inest potentia adeo ut sit ipsa potentia, n. 3091, 4931, 6344, (x)6423; Divinum 
Verum procedens a Domino influit in omnem hominem per interiora ejus in exteriora usque in sensuale externum et in corporeum, et excitat ubivis correspondentia in suo ordine, in sensuali correspondentia 
qualia apparent in mundo et super tellure; sed quia illa quae in mundo et super tellure, apparent aliter quam sunt, ideo sunt plena {1}fallaciis; quare sensuale {2} cum in illis solis {3}malis, 
non potest non contra {4}bona et vera fidei cogitare quia ex fallaciis cogitat, (m)et {5}cum influit Divinum Verum, illud in falsum vertere; quod homo qui non elevatus est a sensuali, sed in illo et cogitat 
ex illo, ex fallaciis cogitet, illustrari potest ab exemplis: sicut(n) fallaciae de vita hominis, quod sit corporis, cum 3 tamen est spiritus in corpore; de visu, quod sit oculi, de auditu, quod 
sit auris, de loquela, quod sit linguae et oris, cum tamen spiritus est qui videt, qui audit, qui loquitur, per organa illa corporis; fallaciae de vita, quod ea sit in homine {6}permanens, cum tamen 
influit; fallaciae de anima, quod non possit esse in humana forma, et in humanis {7}sensibus, et affectionibus; fallaciae de caelo et de inferno, quod illud sit supra hominem et hoc infra illum, cum 
tamen {8}sunt in illo; fallaciae, quod objecta influant in interiora, cum tamen externum non influit in internum, sed internum in externum; fallaciae de vita post mortem, quod non dari queat nisi simul 
sit cum corpore; praeter fallacias in naturalibus, unde conjecturae tam plurium inter se collidentes. 	4 Quis non videre potest quod fallaciae et inde falsa {9}prae veris dominentur, solum ex lite 
quae diu exstiterat de circulatione sanguinis, quae tametsi tot suffulta fuit documentis experientiae, usque tamen in ambiguo diu permansit? et quoque ex lite de sole, quod quotidie circumferretur circum 
hanc tellurem? et non modo sol, sed etiam luna, omnes planetae, et universum caelum stelliferum, semel quovis die? et quoque ex lite quae adhuc perstat de anima, ejus conjunctione cum corpore, et 
de sede ibi? cum fallaciae sensus in talibus dominantur, quae tamen patent qualia sunt ex tam multis phaenomenis et effectibus, quid non in talibus quae sunt caeli, quae quia sunt spiritualia, non patent 
nisi per correspondentias? 	5 Ex his nunc constare potest quale est sensuale hominis in se spectatum, {10}et sibi relictum, quod nempe sit in fallaciis et inde in falsis, ita contra vera et bona 
fidei; inde est quod (t)cum homo in sensuali est et in ejus lumine, in caligine sit quoad illa quae (d)sunt spiritualis mundi, hoc est, quoad illa quae {11}sunt in luce a Divino; et quod lumen sensuale 
vertatur in meram caliginem cum incidit in illud lux e caelo; causa est quia vera quae sunt lucis Divinae non possunt una esse cum fallacibus et inde falsis, {12}sed exstinguunt illa et sic inducunt
