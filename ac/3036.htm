<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3036节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3036.</strong>“曾带领我离开父家和本族之地”表主正是凭这神性本身摆脱了从母亲那里所接受的邪恶与虚假。这从此处“父家和本族之地”的含义清楚可知，“父家和本族之地”是指母亲方面的东西，即来自母亲的遗传之物，它是邪恶与虚假的源头，主与之争战、将其逐出，并在此过程中凭自己的能力使祂的人性变成神性。关于亚伯兰所出的本家和本地，请参看前面所述（<a href="3031.htm">3031</a>节）。关于主的遗传物，前面的论述大意是：主从耶和华遗传来的是神性，从母亲遗传来的是邪恶（<a href="1414.htm">1414</a>，<a href="1444.htm">1444</a>节）；祂与遗传自母亲的邪恶争战，但从没实际犯下任何邪恶（<a href="1444.htm">1444</a>，<a href="1573.htm">1573</a>节）；主脱去遗传自母亲的一切，直到最后不再是她的儿子（<a href="2159.htm">2159</a>，<a href="2574.htm">2574</a>，<a href="2649.htm">2649</a>节）；来自母亲的这种遗传物就是“父家和本族之地”的内义所表示的。“父家”表示遗传自母亲的邪恶，“本族之地”表示遗传自母亲的虚假。因为哪里有邪恶，哪里就有虚假，这二者彼此结合在一起。主凭自己的能力逐出它们（参看<a href="1616.htm">1616</a>，<a href="1813.htm">1813</a>，<a href="1921.htm">1921</a>，<a href="2025.htm">2025</a>，<a href="2026.htm">2026</a>，<a href="2083.htm">2083</a>，<a href="2523.htm">2523</a>节）。</p>

That took me from my father's house, and from the land of my nativity. That this signifies by virtue of which it was that the Lord freed Himself from the things of the mother as to evils and falsities, 
is evident from the signification here of the "father's house" and of the "land of nativity," as being the maternal, or that which was hereditary from the mother, from which came the evil and falsity 
against which the Lord fought, and which He expelled, and thus made His Human Divine by His own power. (See what was said above, n. 3031, concerning the house and the land from which Abram came; also 
what was said concerning the Lord's heredity: That from Jehovah there was what was Divine, and from the mother what was evil (n. 1414, 1444): That He fought against the evil inherited from the mother; 
but that He had no actual evil (n. 1444, 1573): That the Lord put off all that was inherited from the mother, so that at length He was not her son (n. 2159, 2574, 2649): This heredity from the mother 
is what is signified in the internal sense by the "father's house" and the "land of nativity;" by the "father's house," the maternal heredity as to evil; and by the "land of nativity," the maternal 
heredity as to falsities; for where evil is, there are falsities, for they are conjoined with each other: These He expelled by His own power (n. 1616, 1813, 1921, 2025, 2026, 2083, 2523). </p>

'Who took me from my father's house and from the land of my nativity' means the Divine itself by whom the Lord freed Himself from the evils and from the falsities received from the mother. This is clear 
from the meaning of 'father's house' here and of 'land of nativity' as that received or inherited from the mother, which was the source of the evil and falsity which the Lord fought against and cast 
out, and in so doing made His Human Divine by His own power. Please see what has been stated in <a href="3031.htm">3031</a> about the house and the land from which Abram came, and in what was stated previously to the effect 
that the Lord's heredity from Jehovah was Divine and from the mother evil, in <a href="1414.htm">1414</a>, <a href="1444.htm">1444</a>; that He fought against the evil inherited from the mother but never committed any evil of His own, <a href="1444.htm">1444</a>, <a href="1573.htm">1573</a>; 
and that the Lord cast out everything inherited from the mother till at length He was not her son, <a href="2159.htm">2159</a>, <a href="2574.htm">2574</a>, <a href="2649.htm">2649</a>. That which was inherited from the mother is what is meant in the internal sense 
by 'father's house' and 'land of nativity'. 'Father's house' means the evil inherited from the mother, 'land of nativity' the falsities inherited from her, for where evil exists falsities are present, 
for the two exist joined together. That He cast them out by His own power, see <a href="1616.htm">1616</a>,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a><a href="1813.htm">1813</a>, <a href="1921.htm">1921</a>, <a href="2025.htm">2025</a>, <a href="2026.htm">2026</a>, <a href="2083.htm">2083</a>, <a href="2523.htm">2523</a>.

`Qui accepit me e domo patris mei, et e terra nativitatis meae': quod significet ex Quo Dominus liberavit Se Ipsum a maternis quoad mala et quoad falsa, constat a significatione `domus patris' hic et 
`terrae nativitatis' quod sit maternum seu hereditarium a matre, ex quo malum et falsum, contra quod Dominus pugnavit, et quod expulit, ac ita Humanum Suum propria potentia Divinum fecit; videantur 
quae de domo et terra unde Abram supra n. 3031 dicta sunt, et quae prius de hereditario Domini, quod ex Jehovah Divinum, ex matre malum, n. 1414, 1444 quod contra malum hereditarium ex matre pugnaverit, 
sed quod Ipsi nullum malum actuale, n. 1444, 1573: et quod Dominus exuerit omne hereditarium ex matre, ut tandem non ejus filius esset, n. 2159, 2574, 2649; hoc hereditarium, nempe ex matre, est quod 
in sensu interno significatur per `domum patris' et `terram nativitatis'; per `domum patris' hereditarium maternum quoad malum, et per `terram nativitatis' hereditarium maternum quoad falsa; nam ubi 
malum ibi falsa; sunt sibi conjuncta; quod illa propria potentia expulerit, n. {1}1616, 1813, 1921, 2025, 2026, 2083, 2523. @1 1661 seems better$  </p>
