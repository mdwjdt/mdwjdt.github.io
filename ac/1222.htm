<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1222.</strong>“他是雅弗的哥哥”表它的敬拜是外在的。这从“雅弗”的含义清楚可知，前一章从第18节往后和本章1至5节都论述了，“雅弗”是指外在教会。“闪是雅弗的哥哥”尤表内在教会与外在教会是兄弟，因为这就是内在敬拜和具有内在敬拜的外在敬拜的关系。事实上，这是一种血缘关系，因为仁爱是他们二者里面的主要事物。不过，内在教会是哥哥，因为它是在先和内在的。“雅弗的哥哥”在此还象征，被称为希伯的第二代教会是第一代古教会的兄弟。因为“雅弗”的内义无非是指具有内在的外在敬拜，无论它是哪个教会；因此还指该新教会的敬拜，这敬拜主要是外在的。圣言的内义具有这样的特点，当所关注的共性从字义提取出来后，它并不在意历史细节，因为这二者彼此完全不同。所以，就内义而言，“雅弗的哥哥”在此表这个新教会的敬拜是外在的。除非表示这类敬拜，否则此处就没有必要声明他是雅弗的哥哥。注：也就是说，当关注历史细节时，我们就看不到共性，当关注共性时，就看不到历史细节。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1222.</strong> The meaning of he was the older brother of Japheth as the fact that its worship remained on the surface is established by the symbolism of Japheth as the outer church, dealt with in the last chapter, at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1222/bible_king-james-version_genesis_10_18" target=_top>18</a> and later verses, and earlier in the present chapter, at verses <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1222/bible_king-james-version_genesis_10_1-5" target=_top>1-5</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1222/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1062" target=_top>1062</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1222/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1083" target=_top>1083</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1222/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1091" target=_top>1091</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1222/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1098" target=_top>1098</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1222/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1100" target=_top>1100</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1222/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1144" target=_top>1144-1159</a>]. Here the specific meaning of the fact that Shem was Japheth's older brother is that the inner church and the outer church are brothers, since this is precisely the relation inward devotion bears to the outward worship that holds it. The two are kin, because charity is the main concern of each. The inner church is the older brother, though, since it comes first and is deeper.<br />The idea of Japheth's older brother here also involves the fact that the second ancient church (called Eber) was like a brother to the first ancient church. In an inner sense, Japheth just means outward worship filled with inward worship, in every church. So he also symbolizes the worship of this new ancient church, which remained mostly on the surface. (The Word's inner meaning is such that we ignore the narrative details of the literal sense when focusing on universal themes abstracted from that sense, because the two meanings concern themselves with entirely different matters.) So in an inner sense, Japheth's older brother symbolizes the way the new ancient church worshiped: a superficial way. If it did not mean this, there would be no need for the verse to mention that he was the older brother of Japheth. </p>

The elder brother of Japheth. That this signifies that its worship was external, is evident from the signification of "Japheth," as being the external church, concerning which in the preceding chapter, 
in the 18th and following verses; and above, in this chapter, verses 1 to 5. Here "Shem, the elder brother of Japheth" signifies specifically that the internal church and the external church are brothers; 
for such is the relation of internal worship to external worship in which there is internal. It is a blood-relationship, for in each the principal is charity. But the internal church is the elder 
brother, because it is prior and interior. "The elder brother of Japheth" here involves also that the second Ancient Church, called "Eber," was as a brother to the first Ancient Church. For by "Japheth," 
in the internal sense, nothing else is signified than external worship in which there is internal, in whatever church; thus also the worship of this new Ancient Church, which was chiefly external. 
Such is the internal sense of the Word that the historicals of the literal sense are not attended to when universals, which are abstract from the literal sense, are regarded; for they look toward 
one another in a contrary manner.* Hence "the elder brother of Japheth" here signifies, in the internal sense, the worship of the new Ancient Church, that it was external. Unless this were signified, 
it would be needless to say here that he was the elder brother of Japheth. * That is, when we look at the historicals we lose sight of the universals, and when we look at the universals we lose sight 
of the historicals. [Reviser.] </p>

'He was Japheth's elder brother' means that its worship was external. This is clear from the meaning of 'Japheth' as the external Church, dealt with in verse 18 onwards of the previous chapter and in 
verses 1-5 above of this. Here 'Shem was Japheth's elder brother' means in particular that the internal Church and the external Church are 'brothers', for the relationship of internal worship to external 
worship that has internal worship within it cannot be anything different. It is in fact a blood relationship because charity is the chief thing within both of them; but the internal Church is the 
'elder brother' because it is prior and interior. 'Japheth's elder brother also embodies here the fact that the second Ancient Church called Eber was to the first Ancient Church as a brother, for Japheth 
in the internal sense means nothing other than the external worship that has internal worship within it, whatever Church it may be. Therefore the worship of this new Ancient Church, which worship 
was chiefly external, is meant as well. The internal sense of the Word is such that no attention is paid to the historical details of the literal sense when the universal features are being considered, 
which exist quite separate or abstracted from the literal sense, for the two are completely different from each other. Consequently 'Japheth's elder brother' here means in the internal sense that the 
worship of the new Ancient Church was external. Unless such worship was meant there would have been no need to state here that he was Japheth's elder brother. </p>

</p><b>1222.</b>
Quod 'frater Japheti major' significet quod ejus cultus fuerit externus, constat a significatione 'Japheti' quod sit Ecclesia externa, de quo in cap. praec. vers. 18 seq. et supra in hoc capite a vers. 
1 ad 5; hi 'Shemus frater Japheti major' significat in specie quod Ecclesia interna et Ecclesia externa sint 'fratres,' nam cultus internus ad cultum externum in quo internus, non aliter se habet; 
est enim consanguinitas, quia in utroque est charitas principale, sed interna Ecclesia est 'frater major' quia prior et interior.  'Frater Japheti major' etiam hic involvit quod altera Ecclesia Antiqua, 
'Eberus' appellata, fuerit primae Antiquae Ecclesiae sicut 'frater,' nam per 'Japhetum' in sensu interno nihil aliud significatur quam cultus externus in quo internus, cujuscumque Ecclesiae, ita quoque 
cultus novae hujus Antiquae Ecclesiae qui principaliter fuit externus; talis est sensus internus Verbi ut historica sensus litteralis non attendantur cum universalia spectantur, quae abstracta sunt 
a sensu litterali, se enim mutuo aliter conspiciunt; inde hic 'frater Japheti major' significat in sensu interno cultum novae Ecclesiae Antiquae quod fuerit externus; nisi haec significarentur non 
opus fuisset ut hic diceretur quod esset frater Japheti major. </p>
