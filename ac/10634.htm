<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10634节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10634</strong>.“是在全地列族中所未曾创造的”表这样一部圣言从来没有出现在世界上，无论有教会的地方还是没有教会的地方。这从“奇事”、“在全地”和“列族中”的含义清楚可知：“奇事”是指存在于圣言中的神性事物，如刚才所述（<a href="10633.htm">10633</a>节），当这些事物从最内层到最外层，或从初至末都是神性时，就说它们是被“创造的”；“在全地”是指凡有教会存在的地方，因为在圣言中，“地”表示教会（参看<a href="9325.htm">9325</a>节提到的地方）；“列族中”是指凡没有教会存在的地方，因为在圣言中，“列族或外邦人”表示那些在教会之外的人，因为他们不住在源于圣言的真理之光中。<br />经上之所以说“耶和华要行在全地所未曾创造的奇事”，是因为“创造”表示从最内层到最外层，或从初至末的神性之物。事实上，来自神性的一切事物都始于祂自己，并照着真正的秩序继续行进到最低和最终层。也就是说，它穿过天堂进入作为最低层的世界，在那里止息；因为自然界构成神性秩序的最低层。“创造”一词指的是具有这种来源的事物。世界上的一切受造物都是照着这种真正的秩序而产生并保持存在的；通过来自圣言的真理被主重生的人也是照着这个秩序被塑造的。这一切解释了为何在圣言中，主被称为“创造者”，而重生的人被称为“新造的”（<a href="10373.htm">10373</a>，<a href="10545.htm">10545</a>节）。圣言也照着这种真正的秩序来塑造，并且由于它具有这种性质，所以经上论到它的奇事说，它们是被“创造的”。<br />这些话，即“我要在你众百姓面前行在全地列族中所未曾创造的奇事”在历史意义上表示耶和华即将在以色列人民当中行诸如在全地未曾听闻的那类奇迹。然而，就内义而言，所表示的不是奇迹，而是主即将所做的奇事，因为祂即将提升这样一部圣言，天堂将通过它而与教会结合，从普遍的观点来看，主将与人类结合。那些对属世事物与属灵事物的对应关系一无所知的人不明白圣言就是这样一个奇迹。对天使所在的属灵思维一无所知的人也没有意识到，在圣言的每个细节里面，任何事物的内在存在都含有天堂，因而含有神性生命在自己里面。而事实上，当世人在一个属世层面上感知圣言的每句话时，天使则通过对应关系在一个属灵层面上感知它。正是这一点而非其它东西使得圣言成为神性，并且如此奇妙，以至于再也没有比它更奇妙的了。</p>

Such as have not been created in all the earth and in all nations. That this signifies that there never has been such a Divine in the world where the church is, and where the church is not, is evident 
from the signification of "wonderful things," as being the Divine things of the Word (see just above, n. 10633), which are said to be "created" when they are Divine from inmosts to outermosts, or from 
primes to ultimates; from the signification of "in all the earth," as being wherever is the church, for by "earth" in the Word is signified the church (see at the places cited in n. 9325); and from 
the signification of "in all nations" as being where the church is not, for by "nations" [or "Gentiles"] in the Word are signified those who are outside the church, because not in the light of truth 
from the Word. [2] It is said that "Jehovah will do wonderful things such as have not been created in all the earth," because by "creation" is signified that which is Divine from inmosts to outermosts, 
or from primes to ultimates; for everything which is from the Divine begins from Himself, and advances according to order down to the ultimate end, thus through the heavens down to the world, and there 
rests as in its ultimate, because the ultimate of Divine order is in the nature of the world. That which is such is said to be "created." In such an order has come forth, and in such an order subsists, 
everything in the world that has been created. And in such an order also is the man of the church who by means of truths from the Word has been regenerated by the Lord. From this the Lord is called 
in the Word "the Creator," and a man who has been regenerated is said to be "created anew" (n. 10373, 10545). In such an order also is the Word, and because it is such, it is therefore said of its 
wonderful things that they are "created." [3] By these same words, namely, "before all thy people I will do wonderful things such as have not been created in all the earth and in all nations," in the 
historical sense is signified that Jehovah was about to do miracles among the Israelitish people such as had not been heard of in all the earth. But in the internal sense miracles are not meant, but 
wonderful things which the Lord was about to do by giving such a Word, whereby there would be the conjunction of heaven with the church; and whereby there would be universally the conjunction of the 
Lord with the human race. That the Word is so wonderful is not apprehended by those who do not know anything of the correspondence of natural things with spiritual, and who do not know anything about 
the spiritual thought in which the angels are. Such persons do not know either that there is something within every detail of the Word that has heaven in it, thus that has Divine life in it; when nevertheless 
every word of the Word is by its correspondence perceived spiritually by the angels, when it is perceived naturally by men. It is from this, and from no other source, that the Word is Divine, 
and is so wonderful that nothing is more so. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10634</b></p><p><b>10634.</b>
'Which have not been created in all the earth nor in all nations' means that never before has a Divine Word such as this been present in the world, either where the Church exists or where it does not 
exist. This is clear from the meaning of 'marvellous things' as the Divine things present in the Word, dealt with immediately above in <a href="10633.htm">10633</a>, which are referred to as 'created' ones when they are Divine 
from inmost to outermost levels or first to last; from the meaning of 'in all the earth' as wherever the Church exists, for 'the earth' in the Word means the Church, see in the places referred to 
in <a href="9325.htm">9325</a>; and from the meaning of 'in all nations' as where the Church does not exist, for 'nations' in the Word means those who are outside the Church, because they do not dwell in the light of truth 
derived from the Word.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why it says that Jehovah is about to do marvels 'which have not been created in all the earth' is that 'creation' means that which is Divine from inmost to outermost 
levels or first to last. For everything that comes from the Divine begins in Him and continues in accord with true order right through to the lowest and final level. That is, it passes through 
the heavens right on into the world, which serves as the lowest level, the level on which it comes to rest; for the natural world constitutes the lowest level of Divine order. That which has origins 
such as these is what the word 'created' is used to refer to. Every created thing in the world is both brought into being and kept in being in accord with that true order; and also the member of the Church 
who has been regenerated by the Lord by means of truths from the Word is fashioned in accord with it. All this explains why in the Word the Lord is referred to as the Creator, while the person who 
has been regenerated is referred to as one created anew, see <a href="10373.htm">10373</a>, <a href="10545.htm">10545</a>. The Word too is fashioned in accord with that true order, and since the nature of it is such the word 'created' is used in 
reference to its marvels.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The same words - 'Before all your people I will do marvels which have not been created in all the earth nor in all nations' - mean in the historical sense that Jehovah 
was about to perform miracles among the Israelite people which were unheard of in all the earth. In the internal sense however not miracles should be understood but marvels which the Lord was about 
to do, in that He was about to provide a Word which would be such that by means of it heaven would be joined to the Church, and, to take a universal view, the Lord would be joined to the human race. 
The idea that the Word is a marvel such as this is unintelligible to those who know nothing at all about the correspondence of natural things with spiritual ones. And people who know nothing at all about 
the spiritual level on which angels think are also unaware of the inner presence of anything within all the details of the Word, which hold heaven and so Divine life within them. But in fact through 
correspondence angels perceive every single expression in the Word on a spiritual level when people in the world do so on a natural level. This and nothing else is what makes the Word Divine, so marvellous 
that there is nothing more marvellous.  </p>

`Quae non creata sunt in omni terra, et in omnibus gentibus':  quod significet quod tale Divinum nusquam fuerit in mundo ubi Ecclesia et non Ecclesia, constat ex significatione  `mirabilium' quod sint 
Divina Verbi, de qua mox supra n. 10633; quae dicuntur creata cum Divina sunt ab intimis ad extrema, seu a primis ad ultima; ex significatione `in omni terra' quod sit ubicumque Ecclesia, nam per `terram' 
in Verbo significatur Ecclesia, videatur in locis citatis n. 9325; et ex significatione {1} `in omnibus gentibus' quod sit ubi non Ecclesia, nam per `gentes' in Verbo significantur qui extra Ecclesiam, 
quia non in luce veri ex Verbo. 	[2] Dicitur quod Jehovah facturus sit mirabilia quae non creata sunt in omni terra, quia per `creationem' significatur id quod Divinum est ab intimis ad extrema 
seu a primis ad ultima; omne enim quod a Divino est, incohat ab Ipso, (c)et progreditur secundum ordinem usque ad ultimum finem, ita per caelos usque in mundum, et ibi quiescit ut in suo ultimo, 
nam ultimo ordinis Divini est in natura mundi; quod tale est, hoc dicitur creatum; {2}in tali ordine exstitit, et in tali subsistit omne quod in mundo creatum est; et in tali ordine {3}etiam est homo 
Ecclesiae, qui per vera ex Verbo regeneratus est a Domino; inde Dominus in Verbo dicitur Creator, (c)ac homo dicitur e novo creatus qui regeneratus, videatur n. 10373, 10545; {4}in tali ordine etiam est 
Verbum, et quia tale est, ideo de mirabilibus ejus dicitur quod creata. 	[3] Per eadem illa verba, nempe quod `coram omni populo tuo faciam mirabilia quae non creata sunt in omni terra et in omnibus 
gentibus' in sensu historico significatur quod Jehovah apud populum Israeliticum facturus sit miracula quae non audita in omni terra; {5}ast in sensu interno non intelliguntur miracula sed mirabilia 
quae Dominus facturus per quod daturus {6} tale Verbum, per quod conjunctio esset caeli cum Ecclesia, et universaliter per quod conjunctio esset Domini cum humano genere; quod Verbum tam mirabile sit, 
non capiunt illi qui non sciunt aliquid de correspondentia naturalium cum spiritualibus; et qui non sciunt aliquid de cogitatione spirituali in qua sunt angeli, {7}illi nec sciunt quod detur aliquid 
intus in singulis Verbi, in quibus caelum, ita in quibus vita Divina; cum tamen singulae voces Verbi per correspondentiam percipiuntur spiritualiter ab angelis, cum naturaliter ab hominibus.  Inde et 
non aliunde est Verbum Divinum, et (m)tam mirabile ut nihil mirabilius.(n) @1 omnium gentium$ @2 ex$ @3 quoque$ @4 Quia etiam tale est Verbum$ @5 sed$ @6 i sit$ @7 qui non sciunt aliquid dari posse$ </p>
