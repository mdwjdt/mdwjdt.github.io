Verses 2-5. Esau took his women of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite; and Basemath the daughter of 
Ishmael, the sister of Nebaioth. And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Basemath bare Reuel; and Oholibamah bare Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau which were born unto him in the land 
of Canaan. "Esau took his women of the daughters of Canaan" signifies the first conjunction of natural good with the affection of apparent truth; "Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah 
the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite," signifies the quality which was from the Ancient Church; "and Basemath the daughter of Ishmael, the sister of Nebaioth," signifies a second 
conjunction with the affection of truth from a Divine stock; "and Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz, and Basemath bare Reuel," signifies the first derivations therefrom; "and Oholibamah bare Jeush, and Jalam, 
and Korah," signifies a second derivation; "these are the sons of Esau which were born unto him in the land of Canaan," signifies from the good of the Lord's kingdom. </p>

Verses 2-5 Esau took his wives (femina) from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite; and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite; and Basemath, Ishmael's 
daughter, the sister of Nebaioth. And Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau; and Basemath bore Reuel; and Oholibamah bore Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah. These were the sons of Esau who were born to him in the 
land of Canaan. </p>
<p>'Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan' means the first joining of Natural good - to the affection for apparent truth. 'Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah 
the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite' means its essential nature which it received from the Ancient Church. 'And Basemath, Ishmael's daughter, the sister of Nebaioth' means the 
second joining - to the affection for truth from a Divine stem. 'And Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, and Basemath bore Reuel' means the first derivatives. 'And Oholibamah bore Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah' 
means the second derivative. 'These were the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan' means from the good of the Lord's kingdom. </p>

Vers. 2-5.  Esau accepit feminas suas e filiabus Canaan, Adam filiam Elonis Hittaei, et Oholibamam filiam Anae filiae Zibeonis Hivaei.  Et Basematham filiam Jishmaelis, sororem Nebaioth.  Ee peperit 
Adah Esavo Eliphazum, et Basemath peperit Reuelem.  Et Oholibamah peperit Jeushum, et Jaelam, et Korahum; hi filii Esavi, qui nati ei in terra Canaan.  `Esau accepit feminas suas e filiabus Canaan' 
significat Boni Naturalis primam conjunctionem cum affectione apparentis veri: `Adam filiam Elonis Hittaei, et Oholibamam filiam Anae filiae Zibeonis Hivaei' significat quale quod ex Antiqua Ecclesia: 
`et Basematham filiam Jishmaelis, sororem Nebaioth' significat alteram conjunctionem cum affectione veri ex stirpe Divina: `et peperit Adah Esavo Eliphazum, et Basemath peperit Reuelem' significat 
primas derivationes inde: </p>
<p>`et Oholibamah peperit Jeushum, et Jaelam, et Korahum' significat alteram: `hi filii Esavi qui nati ei in terra Canaan' significat ex bono regni Domini. </p>
