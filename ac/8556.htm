THE INTERNAL SENSE Verses 1-3. And all the assemblage of the sons of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys according to the mouth of Jehovah, and they encamped in Rephidim; 
and there was no water for the people to drink. And the people quarreled with Moses, and they said, Give ye us water and we will drink. And Moses said to them, Why quarrel ye with me? why do ye tempt 
Jehovah? And the people thirsted there for the waters; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this, that thou hast made us come up out of Egypt, to make me die, and my sons, 
and my cattle, with thirst? "And all the assemblage of the sons of Israel journeyed," signifies what is progressive of spiritual life; "from the wilderness of Sin," signifies from a state of temptation 
as to good; "after their journeys," signifies according to the order of life for receiving the life of heaven; "according to the mouth of Jehovah," signifies by the providence of the Lord; "and they 
encamped in Rephidim," signifies the setting in order of the interiors for undergoing temptation as to truth, the nature of which is signified by "Rephidim;" "and there was no water for the people to 
drink," signifies a lack of truth and of the consequent refreshment; "and the people quarreled with Moses," signifies a grievous complaining against truth Divine; "and they said, Give ye us water, and 
we will drink," signifies an ardent longing for truth; "and Moses said to them," signifies an answer by influx into the thought; "Why quarrel ye with me?" signifies that they should be more moderate 
in complaint; "why do ye tempt Jehovah?" signifies that it was against the Divine, of whose aid they despair; "and the people thirsted there for the waters," signifies an increase of longing for truth; 
"and the people murmured against Moses," signifies a greater degree of suffering; "and said, Wherefore is this, that thou hast made us come up out of Egypt," signifies why have we been liberated from 
infestations; "to make me die, and my sons, and my cattle, with thirst," signifies that from the lack of truth everything of spiritual life is expiring. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE </p>
<p>Verses 1-3 And all the assembly of the children of Israel travelled on from the wilderness of Sin, according to their travels, at the mouth of Jehovah, and encamped in Rephidim; 
and there was no water for the people to drink. And the people wrangled with Moses, and said, Give us water and let us drink. And Moses said to them, Why do you wrangle with me? Why do you tempt Jehovah? 
And the people thirsted there for water, and the people grumbled against Moses, and said, Why have you caused us to come up out of Egypt, to cause me, and my children, and my livestock to die of 
thirst?<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> </p>
<p>'And all the assembly of the children of Israel travelled on' means a further development of spiritual life. 'From the wilderness of Sin' means away from a state of temptation having to do 
with good. 'According to their travels' means according to the order of life for receiving the life of heaven. 'At the mouth of Jehovah' means in the Lord's providence. 'And encamped in Rephidim' means 
arranging interior things for undergoing a temptation having to do with truth, the essential nature of that temptation being meant by 'Rephidim'. 'And there was no water for the people to drink' means 
a lack of truth and consequently of refreshment. </p>
<p>'And the people wrangled with Moses' means bitter complaining against God's truth. 'And said, Give us water and let us drink' means a burning desire 
for truth. 'And Moses said to them' means the reply, made through influx into thought. 'Why do you wrangle with me?' means that they should be more restrained in their complaining. 'Why do you tempt 
Jehovah?' means that their complaining is against the Divine, from whom they despair of receiving aid. 'And the people thirsted there for water' means an increase in the desire for truth. 'And the 
people grumbled against Moses' means a greater degree of grief. 'Why have you caused us to come up out of Egypt' means Why have we been delivered from molestations ... 'To cause me, and my children, 
and my livestock to die of thirst?' means, in order for everything constituting spiritual life to perish, owing to the lack of truth?

<p>Vers. 1-3.  Et profecti sunt {1}omnis coetus filiorum Israelis a deserto Sin, secundum profectiones suas ad os Jehovae; et castrametati sunt in Rephidim; et nulla aqua ad bibendum 
populo.  Et jurgatus populus cum Mosche, et dixerunt, Date nobis aquam et bibamus; et dixit illis Moscheh, Quid jurgamini mecum? quid tentatis Jehovam?  Et sitivit ibi populus aquas, et murmuravit populus

defectum veri `et inde recreationis: `et jurgatus populus cum Mosche' significat querimoniam gravem contra verum Divinum: `et dixerunt, Date nobis aquam et bibamus' significat veri ardens desiderium: 
`et dixit illis Moscheh' significat responsum per influxum in cogitationem: `Quid jurgamini mecum?' significat ut moderatiores {2}in querimonia sint: `quid tentatis Jehovam?' significat quod contra 
Divinum, de cujus ope desperant: `et sitivit ibi populus aquas' significat increscentiam desiderii ad verum: `et murmuravit populus contra Moschen' significat (x)indolentiae gradum majorem: `Quare 
hoc ascendere fecisti nos ex Aegypto' significat cur liberati sumus ex infestationibus: `ad faciendum mori me, et filios meos, et pecora mea, siti?' (x)significat ut ex defectu veri exspiret omne vitae 
spiritualis. 	@1 omnes IT$ 	@2 After sint$ </p>
