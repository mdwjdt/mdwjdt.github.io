<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第129节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>129.</strong>众所周知，人受制于他所认定的原则（即便是大错的），他的知识和理性也赞同他的原则。因为总有无数支持的念头在他脑中浮现，使他认同谬见。所以，凡认定看见了、理解了才可信的人，永远不可能信，因为属灵属天之事不为肉眼所见，也不为想象所理解。正确的途径是从主获得智慧，亦即从主的圣言获得智慧，然后他能获得启示，理性和知识也能被照亮。<br />人大可学习知识，因为知识有益生活，也带给人快乐，信的人也大可像世上的学者那样思维、谈论，只是他必须相信主的圣言，并尽可能地以属世的真理及学界熟悉的语言，证明属灵属天的真理。就是说，他的起点当是主，而不是自己，因为前者是生，后者是死。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]129.</strong> Clearly our assumptions control us, even when they are utterly false. All our knowledge and our sophistry bolster these assumptions, drawing together endless supporting arguments that harden us in our false ideas. If we seize, then, on the premise that we will believe nothing until we see and understand it, we will never be able to believe anything. Spiritual and heavenly concepts remain beyond the range of our eyesight, beyond the grasp of our imagination.<br />The proper method is to learn wisdom from the Lord, that is, from his Word. Then all goes well, and in addition light is shed on our rational thinking and factual knowledge.<br />By no means, you see, is the acquisition of knowledge forbidden. Knowledge is useful for our lives, and pleasurable. For a believer no prohibition exists on thinking and speaking the way the well-educated of the world do. But we are to do so on the principle of belief in the Lord's Word and of using earthly truth to confirm spiritual and heavenly truth so far as we can, using language familiar to the academic world. The Lord, not ourselves, must be the source of our principles. This is life; the other way is death. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 129</b></p><p><b>129.</b>
Everyone may know that man is governed by the principles he assumes, be they ever so false, and that all his knowledge and reasoning favor his principles; for innumerable considerations tending to support 
them present themselves to his mind, and thus he is confirmed in what is false. He therefore who assumes as a principle that nothing is to be believed until it is seen and understood, can never 
believe, because spiritual and celestial things cannot be seen with the eyes, or conceived by the imagination. But the true order is for man to be wise from the Lord, that is, from His Word, and then 
all things follow, and he is enlightened even in matters of reason and of memory-knowledge [in rationalibus et scientificis]. For it is by no means forbidden to learn the sciences, since they are useful 
to his life and delightful; nor is he who is in faith prohibited from thinking and speaking as do the learned of the world; but it must be from this principle-to believe the Word of the Lord, and, 
so far as possible, confirm spiritual and celestial truths by natural truths, in terms familiar to the learned world. Thus his starting-point must be the Lord, and not himself; for the former is life, 
but the latter is death. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 129</b></p><p><b>129.</b>
Anybody can recognize that the basic assumptions a person makes, even when completely false, govern him, and that all knowledge and reasoning buttress those assumptions. For countless flattering ideas 
occur to him to confirm him in falsities. Consequently when a person's basic assumption is to believe nothing until he sees and understands it, he cannot possibly believe; for spiritual and celestial 
things are neither visible to the eyes nor comprehensible in mental images. But the true order is for a person to become wise from the Lord, that is, from His Word. In that case everything follows as 
it should, and he is also enlightened in matters of reason and of fact. Indeed nobody is forbidden to acquire knowledge, since it is useful for life and gives delight. And the person in whom faith resides 
is in no way forbidden to think and to talk as learned people in the world do. But he does so from the premise of belief in the Lord's Word and of confirming spiritual and celestial truths by means 
of natural truths, using as far as is possible the terminology of the learned world. Consequently his premise must be the Lord, not self; the former is life, while the latter is death.  </p>

</p><b>129.</b>
Cuivis notum esse potest quod principia capta, etiam falsissima, regant hominem, et quod principiis omnis scientia et ratiocinatio faveat, nam innumera assentientia affluunt, ita confirmatur in falsis; 
quare cui principium est quod nihil credat priusquam videt et intelligit, nusquam credere potest; nam spiritualia et caelestia nec oculis videt, nec phantasia capit. Sed verus ordo est ut ex Domino, 
hoc est, ex Verbo Ipsius sapiat; tunc omnia succedunt, et quoque in rationalibus et scientificis illustratur: nusquam enim negatum est scientias discere, quia utiles sunt vitae et delectabiles; et 
qui in fide: ei nusquam negatum est cogitare et loqui sicut eruditi mundi, sed ex illo principio quod credat Verbo Domini et confirmet veritates spirituales et caelestes per veritates naturales, terminis 
orbi erudito familiaribus, quantum potest; quare ex Domino erit principium non ex semet; illud est vita, hoc autem est mors. </p>
