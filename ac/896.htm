<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第896节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>896.</strong>“挪亚移开方舟的盖观看”表移走虚假后，他承认并相信的信之真理所流出的光明。这一点从“移开盖”的含义清楚可知，“移开盖”表移走遮光之物。由于“方舟”表要重生的古教会成员，故“盖”无非表阻碍他看见天空，即光明之物。虚假就是阻碍之物，故经上说他“观看”。在圣言中，“看”表理解和有信，在此则表他承认真理，对它们有信。知道真理是一回事，承认真理完全是另一回事，而有信又是另外一回事。知道是重生的第一步，承认是第二步，有信是第三步。知道、承认和有信之间的区别从以下事实清楚看出来：即最坏的人也能知道，然而却不承认，如犹太人和那些试图通过似是而非的推理摧毁教义之人。非真信徒也能承认，在某些状态下还能热情地宣讲、证实和说服。然而，除了真信徒外，没人能有信。<br />那些有信的知道、承认并相信，他们有仁爱，也有良知。所以，若非是这样的人，信永远不会归给任何人，即不能说他有信。这才是重生所必需的。仅仅知道属于信的事物是人的一种记忆，并没有理性的认同；承认属于信的事物是由某种原因并为了某种目的而引发的一种理性认同；而有信则是良知的一种活动，也就是说，是主经由良知作工的一种活动。这些区别在来生之人身上最清楚不过。那些仅仅知道的人很多都在地狱中。那些承认的人也有很多在地狱中，因为他们在肉身生活时的承认仅局限于某些状态，如前所述。但在来生，当发现他们所宣讲、教导和以之说服别人的一切一直都是真理时，他们大为惊讶，并且只有当回想起他们曾如此宣讲它时，他们才会承认它是真理。但那些有信的人全都在天堂。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]896.</strong> Noah removed the roof of the ark and looked symbolizes the light of religious truth, once falsity had been removed — truth that they acknowledged and believed. This can be seen from the symbolism of removing the roof as taking away whatever blocks the light. Since the ark symbolizes the people of the ancient church who were regenerating, the roof cannot symbolize anything but what blocked them from seeing heaven [or the sky], that is, the light. What got in the way was falsity. This is why it says that they looked, or saw. In the Word, seeing symbolizes understanding and believing. Here it means that they acknowledged the truth and put their faith in it.<br />Knowing the truth, acknowledging it, and believing it are three entirely different things. Knowledge is the first step of rebirth, acknowledgment is the second, and belief is the third. The differences among knowing, acknowledging, and believing can be seen from the fact that the worst people are capable of knowing without acknowledging; take Jews, for instance, and those who try to destroy the teachings of the church with their specious arguments.{*1} The faithless, moreover, are capable of acknowledging as well as knowing and, in some moods, of preaching, confirming doctrine, and persuading others of its truth, all with great zeal. But they cannot put faith in it if they are not believers.<br />[2] Those who have faith know, acknowledge, and believe. They have charity and they have conscience. So faith can by no means be attributed to anyone — no one can be said to believe — except one who possesses these traits. This, then, is to be regenerate.<br />Mere knowledge of the elements of faith is a matter of memory and does not involve the rational mind's assent. Acknowledgment of the tenets of faith requires some assent on the part of the rational mind — a state of mind produced by certain considerations, with a view to certain ends. The possession of faith, though, is a function of conscience, that is, of the Lord working through conscience.<br />This reality can best be seen in the inhabitants of the other world. Many of those who merely know the truth are in hell. The same goes for those who acknowledge it, since their acknowledgment in earthly life came only in certain moods, as stated. In the next life, when they realize that the things they preached, taught, and convinced others of are actually true, they are quite amazed. They acknowledge those things only when reminded that they had preached them. But everyone who truly believed is in heaven.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On Swedenborg's attitude toward Jews, see note 4 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_896/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_259" target=_top>259</a> and the reader's guide, pages 51-55.

And Noah removed the covering of the ark and saw. That this signifies, on the removal of falsities the light of the truths of faith, which he acknowledged and in which he had faith, is evident from the 
signification of "removing the covering" as being to take away what obstructs the light. As by the "ark" is signified the man of the Ancient Church who was to be regenerated, by the "covering" nothing 
else can be signified than what obstructs or prevents from seeing heaven, or the light. What prevented was falsity; wherefore it is said that he "saw." In the Word "to see" signifies to understand 
and to have faith. Here it means that the man acknowledged truths and had faith in them. It is one thing to know truths, and quite another to acknowledge them, and still another to have faith in them. 
To know is the first thing of regeneration, to acknowledge is the second, to have faith is the third. What difference there is between knowing, acknowledging, and having faith is evident from the fact 
that the worst men may know, and yet not acknowledge, like the Jews and those who attempt to destroy doctrinal things by specious reasoning; and that unbelievers may acknowledge, and in certain states 
preach, confirm, and persuade with zeal; but none can have faith who are not believers. [2] Those who have faith, know, acknowledge, and believe, they have charity, and they have conscience; and therefore 
faith can never be predicated of anyone, that is, it cannot be said that he has faith, unless these things are true of him. This then it is to be regenerate. Merely to know what is of faith is 
of a man's memory, without the concurrence of his reason. To acknowledge what is of faith is a rational consent induced by certain causes and for the sake of certain ends. But to have faith is of conscience, 
that is, of the Lord working through conscience. This is abundantly evident from those who are in the other life. Those who only know are many of them in hell. Those who acknowledge are also 
many of them there, because their acknowledgment in the life of the body has been in certain states only, and when in the other life they perceive that what they had preached, taught, and persuaded others 
is true, they wonder greatly and acknowledge it only when it is recalled to their memory as what they had preached. But those who have had faith are all in heaven. </p>

'Noah removed the covering of the ark, and saw out' means the light, once falsities had been removed, shed by the truths of faith which he acknowledged and in which he had faith. This becomes clear from 
the meaning of 'removing the covering' as taking away the things that obstruct the light. Since 'the ark' means the member of the Ancient Church who was to be regenerated, 'the covering' can mean 
nothing else than that which obstructed his view of the sky, that is, of the light. It was falsity that obstructed it, which is why it is said that he 'saw out'. In the Word seeing means understanding 
and possessing faith. In the present context it means that he acknowledged truths and had faith in them. Knowing truths is one thing, acknowledging truths altogether another, and having faith in truths 
yet another. Knowing is the first step in regeneration, acknowledging the second, and having faith the third. The difference between knowing, acknowledging, and having faith becomes clear from the 
fact that the worst people of all are capable of knowing and yet do not acknowledge, as is the case with Jews and with people who endeavour to demolish matters of doctrine with brilliant arguments. People 
who are not true believers are able to acknowledge as well, and in certain states are able with zeal to preach, confirm, and persuade. None but true believers however can have faith. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 Those 
who have faith know, acknowledge, and believe; they have charity, and they have conscience. Consequently faith can never be attributed to anyone, that is, he cannot be said to have faith, unless he is 
such as these people are. This then is what being regenerate entails. Merely knowing something that belongs to faith is an activity of memory which does not involve any assent of the rational. Acknowledging 
that which belongs to faith is in itself a rational assent brought about by certain causes and for the sake of certain ends. But having faith is an activity of conscience, that is, of the Lord 
working through conscience. These distinctions are made clear best of all from people in the next life. Of those who merely know, many are in hell; and many of those who acknowledge are there also, 
for the reason that their acknowledgement during their lifetime was, as stated, confined to certain states. But when they perceive in the next life that what they have preached, taught, and persuaded 
others of has been the truth, they are most surprised and acknowledge that it is the truth only when they are reminded that they have so preached it. But of those who have had faith, all are in heaven. </p>

Quod 'removit Noah tectum arcae, et vidit' significent remotis falsis lucem veritatum fidei quas agnovit et quibus fidem habuit, constare potest a significatione 'removere tectum,' quod sit auferre 
illa quae impediunt lucem; quia per 'arcam' significatur homo Antiquae Ecclesiae qui regenerandus, per 'tectum' non aliud significari potest quam id quod impedit ne videat caelum, seu lucem; quod impedivit, 
fuit falsum, quare dicitur quod 'vidit'; videre in Verbo significat intelligere et fidem habere; hic quod veritates agnoverit et illis fidem habuerit: prorsus apud est veritates scire, et veritates 
agnoscere, et veritatibus fidem habere; scire est primum regenerationis, agnoscere est secundum, fidem habere est tertium; quae differentia sit inter scire, agnoscere, et fidem habere, inde constare 
potest quod pessimi queant scire et usque non agnoscere, sicut Judaei et ii qui ratiociniis speciosis destruere conantur doctrinalia; quod fides possint quoque agnoscere, et cum in certis statibus 
sunt, ex zelo praedicare, confirmare et persuadere; sed fidem habere non possunt nisi fideles; qui fidem habent, ii sciunt, agnoscunt et credunt, ii charitatem habent, ii conscientiam; quare nusquam 
praedicari potest fides, seu de aliquo quod fidem habeat, nisi talis sit; hoc nunc est, regeneratum esse: solum scire quid fidei, est memoriae non consentiente ejus rationali; agnoscere quod fidei, est 
rationale quoddam consentiens inductum a certis causis et propter certos fines; sed fidem habere est conscientiae, hoc est, Domini operantis per conscientiam: hoc constare quam optime potest ab iis 
in altera vita; qui modo sciunt, sunt plures in inferno; qui agnoscunt, sunt etiam, quia agnoverunt in vita corporis, sicut dictum, in certi, statibus, sed cum percipiunt in altera vita quod verum sit 
quod praedicarunt, informarunt et persuaserunt, multum mirantur; agnoscunt solum quando iis revocatur in memoriam quod ita praedicaverint: sed qui fidem habuerunt, illi omnes sunt in caelo. </p>
