<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2571节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2571.</strong>“亚比米勒又说，看哪，我的地都在你面前”表主对于爱与仁的教义的直觉。这从“说”和“地”的含义清楚可知：“说”是指思考（参看<a href="2506.htm">2506</a>节）；“地”在此是指爱与仁的教义。“地”或“陆地”在内义上具有各种含义（<a href="620.htm">620</a>，<a href="636.htm">636</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>节），而具体含义则从整个思路清楚可知。因为当“天”或“天堂”表教会的内在成员（<a href="82.htm">82</a>，<a href="913.htm">913</a>，<a href="1411.htm">1411</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>节）时，“地”或“陆地”表教会的外在成员；它还表教会所在的地区（<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>节）；表教会本身，在普遍意义上也表主在天上和地上的国度，因为该国度由迦南地或圣地（<a href="1437.htm">1437</a>，<a href="1585.htm">1585</a>，<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>节）来代表；该国度同样由“新天新地”（<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>节）来表示；“地”或“陆地”因表教会成员、教会，以及主的国度，故也表它们的本质成分，也就是对主之爱和对邻之仁，因为它们全系于此（即对主之爱和对邻之仁，参看<a href="537.htm">537</a>，<a href="540.htm">540</a>，<a href="547.htm">547</a>，<a href="553.htm">553</a>，<a href="2130.htm">2130</a>节）。所以，“地”或“陆地”表属于教会的爱与仁的教义，也就是此处“亚比米勒的地”所指的。身为王的“亚比米勒”表信之教义，如前所示；而他所来并居于其中的地表爱与仁的教义，信就源自并居于这教义中。<br />到此为止，主的思维都是关于信之教义的，但现在是关于爱与仁的教义的。其原因在于，主将人性与神性联结起来凭借的是属乎信的真理，然而同时也凭借存在于这些真理中的属乎爱的神性良善。祂是照着人借以变得属灵和属天，但没有像主那样变成神性，以至于在自己有生命的秩序而成就这一切的。但当真理与良善，并良善与真理的神性婚姻在主里面实现（这就是亚比米勒将亚伯拉罕的妻子撒拉归还给他所表示的，参看<a href="2569.htm">2569</a>节）时，主的思维便是关于爱与仁的教义的，并且这种思维也遵照秩序；因为人一旦变得属灵和属天，就不再通过真理思考，而是通过良善思考，然而不是象主那样通过与神性真理结合的神性良善思考。这就是为何爱与仁的义现在第一次被提及的原因，尽管就本身而言，信的教义也一样；在信的一切事物中，主的直觉与思维一直来自神性之爱。正因如此，爱与仁的教义就是神性教义本身，是上古教会所培育的教义。由于该教义与信的教义构成一体，故他们会逐出那些将它们分离之人（参看<a href="2417.htm">2417</a>节）。</p>

Abimelech said, Behold my land is before thee. That this signifies the Lord's perception concerning the doctrine of love and charity, is evident from the signification of "saying," as being to think 
(see n. 2506); and from the signification of "land," as being here the doctrine of love and charity. "Land" (or "earth") in the internal sense signifies various things (n. 620, 636, 1066); and that which 
it signifies is evident from the series or connection. For it signifies the external man of the church, when "heaven" signifies the internal (n. 82, 913, 1411, 1733); it also signifies the region 
where the church is (n. 662, 1066); it signifies the church itself; also in a universal sense the Lord's kingdom in the heavens and on earth, since this was represented by the land of Canaan or the holy 
land (n. 1437, 1585, 1607); the same being signified also by the "new heaven and new earth" (n. 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118); and because "land" signifies the man of the church, the church, and the Lord's 
kingdom, it also signifies that which is their essential, namely, love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor, for on this they all hang (n. 537, 540, 547, 553, 2130); consequently it signifies 
the doctrine of love and charity, which belongs to the church, and which is here the "land of Abimelech;" for by Abimelech as a king is signified the doctrine of faith, as shown above; and by his "land," 
whence and where he was, is signified the doctrine of love and charity, whence and where faith is. [2] That the Lord's thought hitherto had been concerning the doctrine of faith, but now was concerning 
the doctrine of love and charity, comes from the fact that the Lord adjoined the Human to the Divine by means of the truths which are of faith (although at the same time by means of Divine goods 
which are of love, in the truths) according to the order by which man also becomes spiritual and celestial; but not Divine, so as to have life in himself, like the Lord. But when the Divine marriage 
of truth and good and of good and truth in the Lord had been effected (which is signified by Abimelech restoring to Abraham Sarah his wife, see n. 2569), the Lord's thought then was concerning the 
doctrine of love and charity, and this also according to order; for when a man has become spiritual and celestial he then no longer thinks from truth, but from good; yet not from the Divine good united 
to the Divine truth, as did the Lord. This is the reason why the doctrine of love and charity is now for the first time mentioned, although regarded in itself the doctrine of faith is the same; and 
the Lord's perception and thought in everything of faith was always from the Divine Love. Hence it is that the doctrine of love and charity is the Divine doctrine itself, and is that which was cultivated 
in the most ancient churches; and because this made a one with the doctrine of faith, they cast out those who separated them (see n. 2417). </p>

'Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before you' means the Lord's perception regarding the doctrine of love and charity. This is clear from the meaning of 'saying' as thinking, dealt with in <a href="2506.htm">2506</a>, and 
from the meaning of 'land' here as the doctrine of love and charity. 'Land' or 'earth' has various meanings in the internal sense, <a href="620.htm">620</a>, <a href="636.htm">636</a>, <a href="1066.htm">1066</a>, but what is meant in a specific instance is clear from 
the train of thought. For 'land' or 'earth' means the external member of the Church when 'the sky' or 'heaven' means the internal, <a href="82.htm">82</a>, <a href="913.htm">913</a>, <a href="1411.htm">1411</a>, <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>; it also means the region where the Church is, <a href="662.htm">662</a>, <a href="1066.htm">1066</a>; it means the Church itself, and also in the universal sense the Lord's kingdom in heaven and on earth, since 'the land of Canaan' or 'the holy land' was representative of that kingdom, <a href="1437.htm">1437</a>, 
<a href="1585.htm">1585</a>, <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>. The same was also meant by 'a new heaven and a new earth', <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="1850.htm">1850</a>, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>, <a href="2118.htm">2118</a>. And because 'land' or 'earth' means the member of the Church, the Church, and the Lord's kingdom, it also 
means that which is the essential component of these, namely love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour, for it is on these that they all depend, <a href="537.htm">537</a>, <a href="540.htm">540</a>, <a href="547.htm">547</a>, <a href="553.htm">553</a>, <a href="2130.htm">2130</a>. Consequently 'land' 
or 'earth' means the doctrine of love and charity which belongs to the Church, and to which here 'the land of Abimelech' refers. For 'Abimelech as a king' means the doctrine of faith, as has been 
shown, while his land, from which he sprang and in which he dwelt, means the doctrine of love and charity, from which faith springs and in which faith dwells. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why up to this point the 
Lord's thought had been concerned with the doctrine of faith but was now concerned with the doctrine of love and charity is that the Lord joined the Human to the Divine by means of truths which are 
matters of faith, yet at the same time by means of Divine Goods which are matters of love that were present within those truths. This He did according to the order by which also man becomes spiritual 
and celestial but not Divine so as to have life in himself, in the way that the Lord became so. But when the marriage had taken place in the Lord of Divine Truth to Good, and of Good to Truth, which is 
meant by the words 'Abimelech restored to Abraham Sarah his wife', <a href="2569.htm">2569</a>, His thought was now concerned with the doctrine of love and charity, and this also was according to order; for once man has become 
spiritual and celestial he no longer thinks from truth but from good, yet not as the Lord did - from Divine Good united to Divine Truth. This is the reason why the doctrine of love and charity is 
only now mentioned for the first time, even though the doctrine of faith regarded in itself is the same, and the Lord's perception and thought always sprang from Divine love within every thing of faith. 
Hence it is that the doctrine of love and charity is Divine doctrine itself, and was the doctrine which was cultivated in the Most Ancient Churches. And because that doctrine made one with the doctrine 
of faith, they rejected people who separated these; see <a href="2417.htm">2417</a>. </p>

`Dixit Abimelech, Ecce terra mea coram te': quod significet perceptionem Domini de doctrina amoris et charitatis, constat ea significatione `dicere' quod sit cogitare, de qua n. 2506; et a significatione 
`terrae' quod hic sit doctrina amoris et charitatis `terra' in sensu interno varia significat, n. 620, 636, (x)1066, at quid significat, ex serie rerum constat; significat enim externum hominem 
Ecclesiae cum `caelum' internum, n. 82, 913, 1411, 1733; significat etiam tractum ubi Ecclesia, n. 662, 1066; significat ipsam Ecclesiam tum universaliter regnum Domini in caelis et in terris, ex eo quo 
`terra Canaan' seu `terra sancta' illud repraesentabat, n. 1437, 1585, 1607; idem quoque novum caelum et nova terra, n. 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118; et quia hominem Ecclesiae, Ecclesiam et regnum Domino 
etiam significat illud quod essentiale eorum est, nempe amorem in Dominum et charitatem erga proximum, nam inde pendent, n. 537, 540, 547, 553, 2130; proinde doctrinam amoris et charitatis quae e Ecclesiae, 
(m)et quae hic est `terra Abimelechi,' nam per `Abimelechum ut regem' significatur doctrina fidei, ut ostensum, per terram autem ejus, unde et ubi ille {1}, doctrina amoris et charitatis, unde 
et ubi fides(n).  [2] Quod hactenus cogitatio Domini fuerit de doctrina fidei, nunc autem de doctrina amoris et charitatis, inde est quia Dominus Humanum adjunxit Divino per vera quae sunt fidei, tametsi 
simul per Divina Bona quae sunt amoris, in veris {2}, secundum ordinem per quem etiam homo fit spiritualis et caelestis, sed non Divinus qui vitam habet in se, ut Dominus: at cum in Domino conjugium 
Divinum Veri et Boni, ac Boni et Veri, factum, quod significatur per quod `Abimelechus restituit Saram uxorem Abrahamo,' n. 2569, tunc cogitatio fuit de doctrina amoris et charitatis, hoc quoque secundum 
ordinem, cum enim homo factus est spiritualis et {3} caelestis, tunc non amplius cogitat ex vero sed ex bono, at non ex Divino Bono unito Divino Vero, sicut Dominus: haec causa est quod nunc primum 
nominetur doctrina amoris et charitatis, tametsi doctrina fidei in se spectata eadem est, et semper perceptio et cogitatio Domini fuerit ex amore Divino in singulis fidei {3}.  (m)Inde est quod 
doctrina amoris et charitatis sit ipsa doctrina Divina, et illa quae in Antiquissimis Ecclesiis exculta, quae quia unum faciebat cum doctrina fidei, rejecerunt illos qui separabant, videatur n. 2417.(n) 	@1
