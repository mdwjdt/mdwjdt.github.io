<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第862节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>862.</strong>“过了四十天”表先前状态持续的时间，以及随之而来的状态的开始。这一点从“四十”的含义（<a href="730.htm">730</a>节）清楚可知，730节论述了试探，其中就用了“四十昼夜”这个词，它表试探持续的时间。此处，由于此处论述的主题是试探之后的状态，故经上提及的是“四十天”，而不是“四十夜”。原因在于，现在仁爱开始显现，它在圣言中被比作昼，也被称作昼。然而，在此之前尚未与仁爱结合之信则被比夜，也被称作夜（如创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创1.16.htm">1:16</a>；以及圣言其它部分）。在圣言中，信也被称为“夜”，因为它从仁爱那里接受它的光，犹如月亮从太阳那里接受光。因此，信被比作“月亮（月），并被称作“月亮（月）”，而爱或仁被比作“太阳（日）”，并被称作“太阳（日）”。“四十天”（或它们所表示的持续时间）既涉及在先的一切，也涉及随后的一切，故此处经上说“过了四十天”。因此，它们表先前状态持续的时间，以及此处所描述的随之而来的状态的开始。然后，此处开始描述该教会成员试探后的第二状态。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]862.</strong> The symbolism of it happened at the end of forty days as the time that the previous state lasted and the point at which the next commenced is established by the symbolism of forty. In a passage that, referring to times of trial, mentions forty days and forty nights, forty is a symbol for the length that times of trial last (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_862/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_730" target=_top>730</a>). Here, because the subject is the state that follows struggles, it says forty days but not nights. The reason the text speaks only of days is that charity now begins to appear. The Word compares charity to the day and calls it day, while the early faith that is not yet very tightly bound up with charity it compares to the night, and calls night. An example is <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_862/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_16" target=_top>Genesis 1:16</a>; and there are other passages.<br />Another reason that the Word refers to faith as night is that it obtains its light from charity, as the moon does from the sun. So the Word compares faith to the moon and calls it a moon, and it compares love, or charity, to the sun and calls it the sun.<br />Forty days, and the length of time they symbolize, relate both to what comes before and to what comes after, which is why it says at the end of forty days. In this way, they symbolize the duration of the previous state and the commencement of the state presently under discussion.<br />Now begins a description of the second state following periods of struggle for the people in this church. </p>

And it came to pass at the end of forty days. That this signifies the duration of the former state, and the beginning of the following one, is evident from the signification of "forty" which was explained 
at n. 730; where, the subject being temptation, it is said "forty days and forty nights" signifying the duration of the temptation. But because the subject here is the state following temptation, 
it is said "forty days" but not forty nights. The reason is, that charity, which in the Word is compared to "day" and called "day" now begins to appear; and faith which precedes being not yet so conjoined 
with charity, is compared to "night" and called "night" (as in Gen. 1:16; and in other parts of the Word). In the Word faith is also called "night" from its receiving its light from charity, as 
the moon does from the sun; and hence faith is compared to the "moon" and called the "moon" and love or charity is compared to the "sun" and called the "sun." "Forty days" (or the duration which they 
signify) have respect both to what precedes and to what follows, wherefore it is said, "at the end of forty days;" thus they signify the duration of the former state and the beginning of that now treated 
of. Here then commences the description of the second state of the man of this church after temptation. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 862</b></p><p><b>862.</b>
That 'it happened at the end of forty days' means the duration of the former state, and the beginning of the one that followed, is clear from the meaning of 'forty', see <a href="730.htm">730</a>, where, the subject being 
temptation, the phrase 'forty days and forty nights' was used, which meant the duration of temptation. Here, since the subject is the state following temptation, 'forty days' is mentioned but not forty 
nights. The reason is that charity now starts to appear, which in the Word is compared to the day and is called the day. Faith however which precedes but has not yet been so joined to charity is compared 
to the night and is called the night, as in Chapter 1:16, and elsewhere in the Word. Faith is also called 'the night' in the Word because it receives its light from charity, just as the moon does 
from the sun. Faith is therefore also compared to the moon and is called the moon; and love or charity is compared to the sun and is called the sun. 'Forty days', or the duration of time meant by them, 
refers both to the things that precede and to those that follow; hence the statement 'at the end of forty days', which accordingly means both the duration of the previous state, and the beginning 
of the one being described now. This then begins the description of the second state following temptation of the member of this Church.  </p>

</p><b>862.</b>
Quod 'factum a fine quadraginta dierum' significet durationem prioris status et principium sequentis, constat a significatione 'quadraginta,' n. 730, ubi quia agitur de tentatione, dicitur 'quadraginta 
dies et quadraginta noctes' et significavit durationem tentationis; hic quia de statu post tentationem agitur, dicitur 'quadraginta dies,' non autem noctes; causa est quia nunc charitas incipit apparere, 
quae in Verbo comparatur diei et vocatur dies; at fides quae praecedit nondum ita juncta charitati, comparatur nocti et vocatur nox, sicut in cap. 1 vers. 16, et alibi in Verbo.  Fides quoque 
'nox' in Verbo inde appellatur, quia lucem suam accipit a charitate, sicut luna a sole; quare etiam fides comparatur lunae et vocatur luna; et amor seu charitas comparatur soli et vocatur sol.  Quadraginta 
dies, seu duratio quam significant, se refert tum ad illa quae praecedunt, tum ad illa quae sequuntur, quare dicitur 'a fine quadraginta dierum'; ita significant durationem prioris status et principium 
hujus, de quo nunc agitur: hic nunc incohat descriptio secundi status hominis hujus Ecclesiae post tentationem. </p>
