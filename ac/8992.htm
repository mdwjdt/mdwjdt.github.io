<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8992.</strong>出埃及记21:7-11.人若卖女儿作婢女，她不可像男仆那样出去。她若在她主人眼里为恶，以致主人不与她订婚，就要许她赎身。主人若以诡诈待她，就没有权柄把她卖给外邦人。主人若将她许配给自己的儿子，就当照女儿的规矩待她。他若为自己另娶一个，不可减少那女子的饮食、衣服并好合的事。若不向她行这三样，她就可以不花银子，白白地出去。<br />“人若卖女儿作婢女”表源于属世快乐的对真理的情感。“她不可像男仆那样出去”表与缺乏情感的真理不同的一种状态。“她若在她主人眼里为恶”表如果源于属世快乐的对真理的情感与属灵真理不一致。“以致主人不与她订婚”表以致它无法与它结合。“就要许她赎身”表疏远这些真理。“就没有权柄把她卖给外邦人”表不可传给那些不是出身于教会信仰的人。“主人若以诡诈待她”表这将违反神性秩序的律法。“主人若将她许配给自己的儿子”表它若与某种衍生真理一致，以至于能与其结合。“就当照女儿的规矩待她”表它将如同对真理的纯正情感一般。“他若为自己另娶一个”表与源于某个其它源头的对真理的情感结合。“不可减少那女子的饮食、衣服并好合的事”表不剥夺“饮食”所表示的内在生命，也不剥夺“衣服”所表示的外在生命，因而不剥夺“好合的事”所表示的结合。“若不向她行这三样”表剥夺这些东西。“她就可以不花银子，白白地出去”表疏远那属灵真理，没有与它结合的真理。</p>

Verses 7-11. And when a man shall sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out according to the going out of the menservants. If she be evil in the eyes of her master, so that he will 
not betroth her, then he shall let her be redeemed: to sell her to a strange people he shall have no power in his acting treacherously against her. And if he shall betroth her to his son, he shall do 
to her according to the judgment of daughters. If he shall take him another; her food, her covering, and her conjugial due, he shall not diminish. And if he shall not do these three to her, then she shall 
go out free with no silver. "And when a man shall sell his daughter to be a maidservant," signifies the affection of truth from natural delight; "she shall not go out according to the going out of 
the menservants," signifies a state not like truth without affection; "if she be evil in the eyes of her master," signifies if the affection of truth from natural delight does not agree with spiritual 
truth; "so that he will not betroth her," signifies so that it cannot be conjoined; "then he shall let her be redeemed," signifies alienation from these truths; "to sell her to a strange people he 
shall have no power," signifies not to those who are not of the faith of the church; "in his acting treacherously against her," signifies this being contrary to the laws of Divine order; "and if he shall 
betroth her to his son," signifies if it agrees with any derived truth so that it can be conjoined therewith; "he shall do to her according to the judgment of daughters," signifies that it shall be 
as is the genuine affection of truth; "if he shall take him another," signifies conjunction with the affection of truth from another stock; "her food, her clothing, and her conjugial due he shall not 
diminish," signifies no deprivation of the interior life which is "food," nor of the exterior life which is "clothing," thus no deprivation of conjunction which is the "conjugial due;" "and if he shall 
not do these three to her," signifies the deprivation of these; "she shall go out free with no silver," signifies alienation therefrom without truth conjoined with it. </p>

Verses 7-11 And when a man sells his daughter to be a female slave, she shall not go out as the male slaves do.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> If she is bad<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> in the eyes of her master, so that he does not betroth her, let her be 
redeemed. He shall have no power to sell her to a foreign people<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> - he would be acting treacherously towards her. And if he betroths her to his son, he shall deal with her according to the judgement 
of daughters.<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a> If he takes another one for himself, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, and her marital rights. And if he does not do these three things for her, she shall go out for nothing, 
for no silver. </p>
<p>'And when a man sells his daughter to be a female slave' means an affection for truth springing from natural delight. 'She shall not go out as the male slaves do' means a state 
unlike truth devoid of affection. 'If she is bad in the eyes of her master' means if the affection for truth springing from natural delight is not in agreement with spiritual truth. 'So that he does 
not betroth her' means so that it cannot be joined to it. 'Let her be redeemed' means alienation from those truths. 'He shall have no power to sell her to a foreign people' means that it must not pass 
to those who are not of the Church's faith. 'He would be acting treacherously towards her' means that this would be contrary to the laws of Divine order. 'And if he betroths her to his son' means if 
it is in agreement with some derived truth, so that it can be joined to it. 'He shall cleat with her according to the judgement of daughters' means that it will then be like a genuine affection for truth. 
'If he takes another one for himself' means being joined to an affection for truth stemming from some other source. 'He shalt not diminish her food, her clothing, and [her] marital rights' means 
no deprivation of inner life meant by 'food', nor of outer life meant by 'clothing', thus no deprivation of the joining together meant by 'right to be married'. 'If he does not do these three things 
for her' means the deprivation of those things. 'She shall go out for nothing, for no silver' means alienation from that [spiritual truth], without truth joined to it.

{1} Vers. 7-11. Et cum vendiderit vir filiam suam ad ancillam, non exibit secundum exire servorum.  Si mala in oculis domini sui, ut non desponset eam, et redimatur; populo alienigenae non potestatem 
habebit vendendi eam; perfide agendo illum in eam.  Et si filio suo desponsaverit eam, secundum judicium filiarum faciet ei.  Si alteram acceperit sibi, victum ejus, tegumentum ejus, et debitum conjugiale 
ejus non diminuet. Et si tria haec non fecerit ei, et exibit gratis nullo argento.  `Et cum vendiderit vir filiam suam ad ancillam significat affectionem veri ex jucundo naturali: `non exibit secundum 
exire servorum' significat statum non similem vero absque affectione: `si mala in oculis domini sui' significat si affectio veri ex jucundo naturali non concordet cum vero spirituali: `ut non desponset 
illam' significat ut conjungi nequeat: `et redimatur' significat abalienationem ab illis veris: `populo alienigenae non potestatem habebit vendendi illam' significat non illis qui non ex fide 
Ecclesiae: `perfide agendo illo in eam' significat id contra leges ordinis Divini: `et si filio suo desponsaverit eam' significat si concordet cum vero aliquo derivato ut possit ei conjungi: `secundum 
judicium filiarum faciet ei' significat quod sicut affectio veri genuina erit: `si alteram acceperit sibi' significat conjunctionem cum affectione veri ex alia stirpe: `victum ejus, tegumentum ejus, 
et debitum conjugiale [ejus] non diminuet' significat non deprivationem vitae interioris, quae est `victus,' nec vitae exterioris, quae est `amictus,' ita non deprivationem conjunctionis, quae est `debitum 
conjugiale': `[et] si tria haec non fecerit ei' significat deprivationem illorum: `exibit gratis nullo argento' significat abalienationem inde absque vero ei conjuncto. @1 See p. 312, note 6. P 
here reads: 7. Et cum vendiderit vir filiam suam ad ancillam, significat bonum ex vero in naturali, quod serviturum spirituali: non exibit secundum exire servorum, significat quod ejus cum vero non erit 
sicut veri cum bono. 8. Si mala in oculis domini sui, significat si non convenit spirituali:, ut non possit conjungi: et redimatur, significat restitutionem  vero a quo: populo alienigenae non potestatem 
habebit vendendi eam, significat non addicationem ad vera extra Ecclesiam:perfide agendo illum in eam, significat quod hoc contra Divinum ordinem. 9. Et si filio suo desponsaverit eam,significat 
initionem et conjunctionem cum vero ex spirituali: secundum judicium filiarum faciet ei, significat quod tunc agnoscendum a spirituali ut bonum ex se. 10. Si alteram acceperit sibi, significat conjunctionem 
veri etiam cum bono collaterali; victum ejus, tegumentum ejus, et debitum conjugiale ejus, non diminuet, significat quod non abstrahenda a bono illo quae inservitura vitae ejus conservationi. 
11. Et si tria haec non fecerit ei, significat si abstrahuntur: et exibit gratis nullo argento, significat conjunctionem cum bono et non cum vero.$ </p>
