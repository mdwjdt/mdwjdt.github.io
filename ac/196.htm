<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>196.</strong>古时，信赖感官过于启示的人被称为“蛇”。今日的情况更甚，因为现今有些人不仅不信他看不见摸不着的一切，甚至以古人所不知的知识来证明他的观念，结果导致更大的盲目。他们以感官、知识、哲学推导天堂的奥秘，以致一无所见、一无所闻。他们不仅是“聋蛇”，更是经上常说的毒性更大的“飞蛇”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.29.htm">14:29</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.6.htm">30:6</a>）。<br />对于他们是如何障蔽自己的，我们不妨以灵魂的存在为例。只相信感官印象的感官主义者否认灵魂的存在，因为他们看不见灵魂，故说：“灵魂是虚无的，因为我感觉不到，只有我看得见，摸得着的，我才确定它是存在的。”<br />凭知识下结论的学者则说：“灵魂是什么，还不是一股气流或热能之类的，很快就在空中消散了？动物不是也有躯体、感官及一定的理性吗？人们却说动物必要死，人的灵魂则要永存。”他们以此否认灵魂的存在。<br />思辨更敏捷的哲士以他们自己都不理解的术语谈论灵魂，彼此争论，声称物质、结构、空间性的词句不能用来描述灵魂，遂将灵魂从观念中抽离，使之消于无形。<br />相对理智的人，则声称灵魂是思维，但是，他们将灵魂与实体脱离，最终得出结论，说当肉体断气时，灵魂也将消散。<br />所以，一切以感官、知识、哲学作推理的人，都否认灵魂的存在，对一切灵魂之学都不予采信。<br />心地单纯的人与之不同，当被问起，他们会说灵魂真实存在，因为主说他们死后将继续活着。所以，他们没有泯灭理性，而是凭主的话将理性激活了。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]196.</strong> In ancient times, people who put more trust in what they learned through their senses than in what had been revealed were called snakes. The situation now is even worse, since some people not only believe nothing except what they can see and touch but also use facts unknown to the ancients to confirm their point of view. The result is that they blind themselves far more profoundly.<br />People who judge heavenly matters on the basis of the senses, book learning, or philosophical reasoning blind themselves so badly that they no longer see or hear anything at all. They become not just deaf snakes but the much more deadly flying snakes the Word also mentions [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_196/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_14_29" target=_top>Isaiah 14:29</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_196/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_30_6" target=_top>30:6</a>]. To see how they do this to themselves, take their beliefs about spirit as an illustration.<br />[2] Sense-oriented people, or those who believe only what their senses tell them, deny that spirit exists because they cannot see it. "It isn't anything," they say, "because I can't sense it. If I can see or touch something, then I know it exists."<br />Scholars, or people who depend on written knowledge for their conclusions, say, "What is spirit but a puff of air, maybe, or body heat?" — or something else within the scope of their learning. "And when it's snuffed out, the spirit vanishes. Don't animals also have a body, physical senses, and something like reason? Yet people say animals are destined to die, while the human spirit is destined to live on."{*1} So they deny that spirit exists.<br />[3] Philosophers, who claim to be keener of intellect than anyone else, speak of spirit in technical terms. These terms they do not even understand themselves, since they debate them, claiming that not a single word that derives from [notions of] matter, organic substance, or extension in space can be applied [to the human spirit]. So they bury the idea in speculation until it disappears from their sight and turns into nothing.<br />The saner ones admit that thought exists; but when they argue about thought, they eventually come to the conclusion that it will dissolve when the body dies, because they separate it from any kind of substance.{*2} Everyone, then, who analyzes the question on the basis of the senses, written knowledge, or philosophy denies that spirit exists. And when they deny its existence, they believe absolutely nothing that is said about spirit or spiritual things. If you ask the simple at heart, on the other hand, they say that they know it exists because the Lord said they would live on after death. They do not snuff out their rational capacity; instead they make it a living thing by means of the Lord's Word.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Philosophers and scientists of the Enlightenment period were especially intrigued with the question of the difference between animals and humans. Some thinkers averred that animals did not have souls; others were just as confident that they did. Some saw the distinguishing feature of humanity as the possession of the reasoning soul (compare Swedenborg's view in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_196/swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_39" target=_top>Heaven and Hell 39</a>), and others, like the putative speaker here, argued that if animals did not have souls, humans could not possess them either — since a human being is only a special form of animal. For a fuller discussion and refutation of this argument, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_196/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4760#subsection-2-2" target=_top>Secrets of Heaven 4760:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_196/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5114#subsection-2-5" target=_top>5114:5</a>. For further resources and discussion of the general topic of the animal during the Enlightenment, see Swedenborg [1771] 2006, 688 note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_196/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_46" target=_top>46</a>. [JSR, SS]<br />{*2} Swedenborg is here reflecting on a philosophical debate that generated much controversy in his own day and continues down to the present: Does mind, or consciousness, precede physical existence, or is it an epiphenomenon, that is, a side-effect, of matter? The "sense-oriented people" here are those who give no credence to anything but sensory experience, believing that only the experience of the senses gives rise to consciousness. In his later work Soul-Body Interaction (published in 1769), Swedenborg characterizes this as the view of the disciples of Aristotle (384-322 b.c.e.) — that is, the adherents of Scholastic philosophy. The followers of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) adhere to a notion of "preestablished harmony," where the soul and body operate in parallel without any physical interaction. These could be the philosophers Swedenborg has in mind here who "separate [thought] from any kind of substance." (Swedenborg considers spiritual "substance" a necessary medium for thought. See, for instance, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_196/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_444" target=_top>444</a>. Concerning spiritual substance, see note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_196/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_272" target=_top>272</a>.) In the summary in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_196/swedenborg_interaction-of-the-soul-and-body-vickers_19" target=_top>Soul-Body Interaction 19</a>, the followers of René Descartes (1596-1650) seem closest to Swedenborg's own view, insofar as they hold to the doctrine of "spiritual influx," granting primacy to the unseen realities rather than to those we can see and touch. In fact, Descartes's view of this issue was considerably more complex than the summary in Soul-Body Interaction suggests. Descartes felt the need to assert the essential independence of soul and body — that is, of mind and brain — while acknowledging their interdependence in numerous capacities, and, moreover, insisting that the soul could survive the body after death. In his mature philosophy, he posited the substantial union of mind and body, while granting that certain mental functions were independent of the brain (Gaukroger 1995, 388-394). In the early modern era, as in ours, a tremendous amount of literature was written on the mind-body issue, though no theory then or now has won universal approval. [RS] </p>

In ancient times those were called "serpents" who had more confidence in sensuous things than in revealed ones. But it is still worse at the present day, for now there are persons who not only disbelieve 
everything they cannot see and feel, but who also confirm themselves in such incredulity by knowledges [scientifica] unknown to the ancients, and thus occasion in themselves a far greater degree 
of blindness. In order that it may be known how those blind themselves, so as afterwards to see and hear nothing, who form their conclusions concerning heavenly matters from the things of sense, of memory-knowledge, 
and of philosophy, and who are not only "deaf serpents" but also the "flying serpents" frequently spoken of in the Word, which are much more pernicious, we will take as an example what 
they believe about the spirit. [2] The sensuous man, or he who only believes on the evidence of his senses, denies the existence of the spirit because he cannot see it, saying, "It is nothing because 
I do not feel it: that which I see and touch I know exists." The man of memory-knowledge [scientificus], or he who forms his conclusions from memory-knowledges [scientiae], says, What is the spirit, 
except perhaps vapor or heat, or some other entity of his science, that presently vanishes into thin air? Have not the animals also a body, senses, and something analogous to reason? and yet it is asserted 
that these will die, while the spirit of man will live. Thus they deny the existence of the spirit.  [3] Philosophers also, who would be more acute than the rest of mankind, speak of the spirit 
in terms which they themselves do not understand, for they dispute about them, contending that not a single expression is applicable to the spirit which derives anything from what is material, organic, 
or extended; thus they so abstract it from their ideas that it vanishes from them, and becomes nothing. The more sane however assert that the spirit is thought; but in their reasonings about thought, 
in consequence of separating from it all substantiality, they at last conclude that it must vanish away when the body expires. Thus all who reason from the things of sense, of memory-knowledge, and 
of philosophy, deny the existence of the spirit, and therefore believe nothing of what is said about the spirit and spiritual things. Not so the simple in heart: if these are questioned about the existence 
of spirit, they say they know it exists, because the Lord has said that they will live after death; thus instead of extinguishing their rational, they vivify it by the Word of the Lord. </p>

In ancient times people who relied on sensory evidence rather than matters of revelation were called serpents. Nowadays the position is even worse, for not only are there people who believe nothing unless 
they can see it with their eyes and apprehend it with their senses, there are also those who confirm themselves in that attitude by means of facts unknown to the most ancient people, and who in 
so doing blind themselves very much more. To make known how people who draw conclusions about heavenly things on the basis of sensory evidence, facts, and philosophical arguments, so blind themselves 
that they subsequently see and hear absolutely nothing, and who are not only the deaf serpents but also the far more deadly flying serpents, mentioned in the Word as well, let their belief concerning 
the spirit serve as an example.   </p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Anybody who is sensory-minded, that is, whose belief is rooted solely in the senses, denies the existence of the spirit because he does not see it. He says, 'Because 
I do not feel it, it is nothing; what I see and touch, I know to exist'. Anybody who is factually-minded, that is, who bases his conclusions on factual knowledge, says, 'What is the spirit but perhaps 
breath, or vital heat, or something else known to me, which is dissipated when it comes to an end? Do not animals as well have a body, and senses, and something analogous to reason? Yet people 
say that animals are destined to die but man's spirit to live.' In this way they deny the existence of the spirit. Philosophers, men wishing to be more incisive than everybody else, speak of the spirit 
in terms which they themselves are not clear about since they argue about them. They contend that not a single expression is applicable which in any way derives from what is material, organic, or spatial. 
In this way they dismiss the spirit from their ideas, and as a result it passes from their notice and becomes nothing at all.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Those among them however who are more sensible say that the 
spirit is thought, but when they begin to reason about thought they at length conclude, since they separate thought from substance, that it will disappear when the body breathes its last. In this way 
everyone who reasons on the basis of sensory evidence, facts, and philosophical arguments denies the existence of the spirit, and in denying its existence never believes anything that is said about the 
spirit or about spiritual things. But if indeed the simple in heart are questioned they say that they know that the spirit exists because the Lord has said that they will live after death. Instead 
of smothering their rationality they nurture it by means of the Word of the Lord. </p>

Antiquitus dicti serpentes qui fiderunt sensualibus plus quam revelatis; hodie adhuc pejus, sunt enim non solum qui nihil credunt nisi videant et sentiant, sed etiam qui se confirmant per scientifica 
antiquissimis ignota, ac ita se multo magis occaecant: ut sciatur quomodo ii qui ex sensualibus, scientificis et philosophicis concludunt de caelestibus, se occaecant ut dein nihil prorsus videant et 
audiant sintque non solum serpentes surdi, sed etiam serpentes volantes, qui multo perniciosiores, de quibus etiam in Verbo; sit in exemplum quid credant de spiritu: [2] qui sensualis est seu sensibus 
modo credit, is negat dari spiritum, quia eum non videt, dicens nihil esse 'quia non sentio; quod video et tango, hoc scio quod sit.' Qui scientificus est seu ex scientiis concludit, is dicit, 'Quid 
spiritus, nisi forte halitus vel calor vel aliud quidpiam quod scientiae ejus est, quo extincto evanescit? annon animalia quoque habent corpus, sensus, analogon rationis? et illa dicunt moritura, et 
hominis spiritum victurum: ita negant dari spiritum.  Philosophi, qui ceteris acutiores volunt esse, de spiritu per terminos loquuntur quos ipsi non sciunt, quia de iis litigant; contendentes non applicabilem 
esse unicam vocem quae aliquid ex materiali, organico aut extenso trahit; ita subducunt eum suis ideis, sic ut iis evanescat fiatque nihil. [3] Saniores autem usque dicant esse cogitationem; 
sed cum de cogitatione ratiocinantur, tandem, quia separant illam a substantiali, concludant, quod evanitura sit cum corpus exspirat.  Ita omnes qui ex sensualibus, scientificis et philosophicis ratiocinantur, 
negant quod sit spiritus, et cum negant quod sit, nihil usquam credunt, quid de spiritu et de spiritualibus dicitur. At vero, si interrogantur simplices corde, dicunt ii quod sciant dari, quia 
Dominus dixit se victuros post mortem; ii non exstinguunt suum rationale sed vivere faciunt per Verbum Domini. </p>
