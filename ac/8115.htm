<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8115节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8115.</strong>木星灵不能与我们地球灵呆在一起，因为我们地球灵具有完全不同的性情，不喜欢像他们那样的安宁的快乐氛围。当听说来自我们地球、变成天使的人内心完全不同，几乎不保留任何类似他们为灵人时的那种状态的东西时，木星灵很惊讶。为叫他们知道情况就是这样，由我们地球来的天使组成的众多唱诗班一个接一个从天而降。当许多人聚集起来，作为一体以一个连续的系列一起思考、说话和行动时，一个唱诗班就形成了。在天上，大多数情况下，向主所献上的赞美是由唱诗班来完成的（参看<a href="1648.htm">1648</a>，<a href="1649.htm">1649</a>，<a href="2595.htm">2595</a>，<a href="2596.htm">2596</a>，<a href="3350.htm">3350</a>，<a href="5182.htm">5182</a>节）。这些唱诗班给予同我在一起的木星灵们如此多的快乐，以致他们觉得自己似乎被带上天堂。唱诗班的这种颂扬持续了约一个小时。唱诗班给予这些灵人的快乐传给了我，我能亲身体验到它们。他们说，他们会把这事告诉其它地方的同伴。</p>

The spirits of the earth Jupiter cannot be together with the spirits of our earth, because these are of a wholly different genius, and do not love the delight of tranquillity as they do. It surprised 
them to hear that people from our earth who become angels are wholly different in heart, and retain scarcely anything that is like their state when they were spirits. To show them that such is the case 
there came in succession from heaven a number of choirs of angels from our earth. (There are choirs when many think, speak, and act all together as a one in an uninterrupted series: the celebration 
of the Lord in the heavens is for the most part effected by means of choirs: as to choirs, see n. 1648, 1649, 2595, 2596, 3350, 5182.) These choirs gave so much delight to the spirits of Jupiter who 
were with me that they seemed to themselves to be as it were transported into heaven. This glorification by means of choirs lasted about an hour. The delicious feelings excited thereby in the spirits, 
being communicated to me, I was enabled to feel them. They said that they would tell this to their people who were elsewhere. </p>

Spirits belonging to the planet Jupiter cannot remain together with spirits belonging to our planet because the latter have a completely different disposition and have no liking for the delightful atmosphere 
that goes with the calm like theirs. They were astonished when they heard that people from our planet who become angels are altogether different in heart, retaining scarcely anything that resembles 
their state when they were spirits. To let them know that this was so groups or choirs of angels who had lived on our planet came, one choir after another. (A choir exists when a considerable number 
group together, thinking, speaking, and acting as one in continuous progression. In heaven praise to the Lord is offered in most instances by choirs. Regarding choirs, see <a href="1648.htm">1648</a>, <a href="1649.htm">1649</a>, <a href="2595.htm">2595</a>, <a href="2596.htm">2596</a>, <a href="3350.htm">3350</a>, <a href="5182.htm">5182</a>.) Those choirs gave the spirits belonging to Jupiter who were present with me so much pleasure that it seemed to them as though they were caught up to heaven. The glorification by the choirs 
lasted for a whole hour or thereabouts. The delight which the choirs gave those spirits was transmitted to me to experience for myself. They said that they would tell their companions who were elsewhere 
about it. </p>

Spiritus telluris Jovis cum spiritibus nostrae telluris non simul esse possunt quia prorsus alio genio sunt et non {1}amant jucundum tranquillitatis sicut illi; mirati sunt cum audirent quod qui ex 
nostra tellure angeli fiunt prorsus alio corde sint, et vix aliquid simile status sui, cum fuerunt spiritus, retineant; ut scirent quod ita {2}esset, ex caelo {3}ab angelis e nostra tellure, veniebant 
chori, unus post alterum; (chori sunt quando plures simul unum cogitant, loquuntur, et agunt, in serie continua; celebratio Domini in caelis per choros utplurimum fit; de choris videatur n. 1648, 1649, 
2595, 2596, 3350, 5182;) chori illi tantopere oblectabant spiritus Joviales qui apud me ut viderentur sibi quasi in caelum rapti; glorificatio illa per choros perstabat per unam horam circiter; delicias 
(c)illorum quas inde capiebant, mecum communicatas sentire dabatur; dicebant (x)quod id dicerent suis qui alibi. 	@1 Before sicut$ 	@2 sit$ 	@3 ubi angeli$ </p>
