<p><strong>[NCE]475.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_475/bible_king-james-version_genesis_5_2" target=_top>Genesis 5:2</a>. Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and called their name Human Being{*1} on the day on which they were created.<br />Male and female symbolizes the marriage between faith and love. Calling their name Human Being means they were a church, which especially deserves the name of Human.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The Hebrew word for "human being" is אָדָם ('āḏām); see note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_475/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_313" target=_top>313</a>. Many translations, including the King James, the Latin Vulgate, and the Greek Septuagint, render it as a proper name, Adam, in this verse. Swedenborg uses the Latin equivalent of the common noun, Homo, meaning "a human being." In <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_475/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_478" target=_top>478</a> Swedenborg states that the first human "is never called by the proper name Adam but is called the human," although in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_475/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566" target=_top>566:1</a> he acknowledges that the word is also used as a name.

Verse 2. Male and female created He them, and blessed them, and called their name Man, in the day when they were created. By "male and female" is signified the marriage between faith and love; by "calling 
their name Man" is signified that they were the church, which, in an especial sense, is called "Man [homo]." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 475</b></p><p><b>475.</b>
Verse 2 Male and female He created them, and blessed them, and called their name Man, on the day when they were created.   'Male and female' means the marriage of faith and love. 'Calling their name 
Man' means the Church, which in a particular sense is called Man.

Vers. 2.  Masculum et feminam creavit illos; et benedixit illis; et vocavit nomen illorum Homo, die quo creati sunt.  Per 'masculum et feminam' significatur conjugium inter fidem et amorem: per 'vocare 
nomen illorum Homo' significatur quod Ecclesia, quae imprimis Homo vocatur. </p>
