Verses 29-32. And Jacob asked and said, Tell I pray thy name. And he said, Wherefore is this that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there. And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel; 
for I have seen God faces to faces, and my soul is delivered. And the sun arose to him as he passed over Penuel, and he halted upon his thigh. Therefore the sons of Israel eat not the nerve of that which 
was displaced, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, even unto this day, because he touched in the hollow of Jacob's thigh the nerve of that which was displaced. "And Jacob asked and said, Tell 
I pray thy name," signifies the angelic heaven and its quality; "and he said, Wherefore is this that thou dost ask after my name?" signifies that heaven was not willing to reveal itself; "and he blessed 
him there," signifies conjunction with the Divine celestial spiritual; "and Jacob called the name of the place Peniel," signifies a state of temptations; "for I have seen God faces to faces and my 
soul is delivered," signifies that He endured the most grievous temptations as if they were from the Divine; "and the sun arose to him," signifies the conjunction of goods; "as he passed over Penuel," 
signifies a state of truth in good; "and he halted upon his thigh," signified that truths were not yet disposed into such an order that all together with good might enter into celestial spiritual good; 
"therefore the sons of Israel eat not the nerve of that which was displaced, which is upon the hollow of the thigh," signifies that those were not appropriated in which were falsities; "even unto this 
day," signifies even forever, that falsities should not be adjoined; "because he touched in the hollow of Jacob's thigh the nerve of that which was displaced," signifies the reason, because they are 
falsities.  [2] In the internal historical sense, in which the posterity of Jacob is treated of, by "Jacob asked and said, Tell I pray thy name," evil spirits are signified; by "he said, Wherefore 
is this that thou dost ask after my name?" is signified that from evil spirits they did not acknowledge; by "he blessed him there," is signified that it was so done; by "Jacob called the name of the 
place Peniel," is signified the state in that they put on representations; by "for I have seen God faces to faces, and my soul is delivered," is signified that He was present representatively; by "the 
sun arose to him," is signified when they came into representations; by "as he passed over Penuel," is signified when they came into the land of Canaan; by "he halted upon his thigh," is signified that 
goods and truths were altogether destroyed with that posterity; by "therefore the sons of Israel eat not the nerve of that which was displaced, which is upon the hollow of the thigh," is signified 
that the posterity ought to know this; by "unto this day," is signified that they are such forever; by "because he touched in the hollow of Jacob's thigh the nerve of that which was displaced," is signified 
because they had a heredity which could not be eradicated by regeneration, because they would not allow this. </p>

Verses 29-32 And Jacob asked and said, Tell me, I pray, your name. And he said, Why is it that you ask my name? And he blessed him there. And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, [saying,] For 
I have seen God face to face, and my soul is delivered. And the sun rose on him as he passed over Penuel, and he was limping on his thigh. Therefore the children of Israel do not eat the sinew of that 
which was displaced, which is on the hollow of the thigh, even to this day, because he touched, in the hollow of Jacob's thigh, the sinew of that which was displaced. </p>
<p>'Jacob asked and said, Tell me, 
I pray, your name' means the angelic heaven and the nature of that heaven. 'And he said, Why is it that you ask my name?' means that heaven was unwilling to reveal itself. 'And he blessed him there' 
means a joining to the Divine celestial-spiritual. 'And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel' means a state of temptations. 'For I have seen God face to face, and my soul is delivered' means that 
He suffered the severest temptations, seemingly attributable to the Divine. 'And the sun rose on him' means when the one kind of good was joined to the other. 'As he passed over Penuel' means a state 
of truth within good. 'And he was limping on his thigh' means that truths were not yet arranged into such an order that together with good they could all enter celestial-spiritual good. 'Therefore 
the children of Israel do not eat the sinew of that which was displaced, which is on the hollow of the thigh' means that no truths containing falsities were assimilated. 'Even to this day' means that, 
perpetually so, falsities would not be attached. 'Because he touched, in the hollow of Jacob's thigh, the sinew of that which was displaced' means for the reason that they were indeed falsities. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
In the internal historical sense, where the descendants of Jacob are the subject, 'Jacob asked and said, Tell me, I pray, your name' means evil, spirits 'He said, Why is it that you ask my name?' means 
that they did not acknowledge evil spirits to be the origin. 'He blessed him there' means that so it was done. 'Jacob called the name of the place Peniel' means a state in which they took on representations. 
'For I have seen God face to face, and my soul is delivered' means His presence through representations. 'The sun rose on him' means when they entered into representations. 'As he passed 
over Penuel' means when they entered the land of Canaan. 'He was limping on his thigh' means that with those descendants goods and truths had been destroyed completely. 'Therefore the children of Israel 
do not eat the sinew of that which was displaced, which is on the hollow of the thigh' means that those descendants ought to know this. 'Even to this day' means that their nature was perpetually so. 
'Because he touched, in the hollow of Jacob's thigh, the sinew of that which was displaced' means because of their heredity which could not be rooted out through regeneration because they would not 
allow that to happen. </p>

Vers.  29-32.  Et interrogavit Jacob et dixit, Indica quaeso nomen tuum, et dixit, Quare hoc interrogas ad nomen meum? et benedixit ei ibi.  Et vocavit Jacob nomen loci Peniel, quia vidi Deum facies 
ad facies, et liberata anima mea.  Et exortus ei sol, sicut transivit Penuel, et is claudicans super femore suo. Propterea non edunt filii Israelis nervum emoti, qui super vola femoris, usque ad 
diem hunc, quia tetigit in vola femoris Jacobi nervum emoti. `Interrogavit Jacob et dixit, Indica quaeso nomen tuum' significat caelum angelicum et ejus quale: `et dixit, Quare hoc interrogas ad 
nomen meum?' significat quod caelum non vellet se revelare: `et benedixit ei ibi' significat conjunctionem cum Divino caelesti spirituali: `et vocavit Jacob nomen loci Peniel' significat statum tentationum: 
`quia vidi Deum facies ad facies, et liberata est anima mea' significat quod sustineret gravissimas tentationes sicut forent a Divino: `et exortus ei sol' significat conjunctionem bonorum: 
`sicut transivit Penuel' significat statum veri in bono: `et is claudicans super femore suo' significat quod vera nondum in illum ordinem disposita, ut omnia simul cum bono intrarent bonum caeleste 
spirituale: `propterea non edunt filii Israelis nervum emoti, qui super vola femoris' significat quod non appropriata illa in quibus falsa: `usque ad diem hunc' significat in perpetuum quod falsa 
non adjuncta: `quia tetigit in vola femoris Jacobi nervum emoti, significat causam, quia falsa.      {1} In sensu interno historico in quo agitur de posteris Jacobi, per `interrogavit Jacob et dixit, 
Indica quaeso nomen tuum significantur mali spiritus: per `dixit, Quare hoc interrogas ad nomen meum?' significatur quod non agnoscerent a malis spiritibus: </p>
<p>per `benedixit ei ibi' significatur 
quod ita factum: per `vocavit Jacob nomen loci Peniel' significatur status quod induerent repraesentationes: [per] `quia vidi Deum facies ad facies, et liberata anima mea' significatur quod repraesentative 
praesens: per `exortus ei sol' significatur cum venirent in repraesentationes: </p>
<p>per `sicut transivit Penuel' significatur cum venirent in terram Canaanem: per `is claudicans super femore suo' 
significatur quod bona et vera prorsus deperdita essent apud posteritatem illam: per `propterea non edunt filii Israelis nervum emoti qui super vola femoris' significatur quod posteri hoc scire 
deberent: per `usque ad diem hunc' significatur in perpetuum quod tales: per `quia tetigit in vola femoris Jacobi nervum emoti' significatur quia hereditarium illis quod per regenerationem eradicari 
non potuit, quia non admitterent.      @1 This is further explained in n. 4306-4317.$ </p>
