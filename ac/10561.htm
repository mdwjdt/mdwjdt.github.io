<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10561节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10561</strong>.“却没有叫我知道你要打发谁与我同去”表没有神性的指引，这事无法成就。这从“打发谁与摩西和这个民族同去”的含义清楚可知，当由耶和华来打发时，“打发谁与摩西和这个民族同去”是指神性将要引领它们，如下文所述。因为摩西知道，他的确能将这百姓领进迦南地，但没有神性的指引和指示，他们不会进入占有它；这说明并表示，教会不会建立这个民族当中，正如前面所提出的（<a href="10559.htm">10559</a>，<a href="10560.htm">10560</a>节）。由此明显可知，“你对我说，将这百姓领上去；却没有叫我知道你要打发谁与我同去”表示没有神性的指引，教会不可能建立在这个民族当中。这就是天使在这些话中所看到的，无论世人是如何看待它们的；因为天使照圣言的内在意义看待圣言中的一切，而世人照圣言的外在意义看待它们；然而，这外在意义含有内在意义在里面。当论及耶和华时，“打发谁与他们同去”表示神性要引领他们，这是因为“耶和华打发”表示神性引领，以及神性发出。这就是为何在原文，天使因被差遣而被称呼为天使或使者，这也是为何主如此频繁地说，祂是父所差来的，意思是说，祂就是神性的发出（参看<a href="4710.htm">4710</a>，<a href="6831.htm">6831</a>节）。由此明显可知“打发谁与我同去”在内义上表示什么。</p>

And Thou hast not made known to me whom Thou wilt send with me. That this signifies that this cannot be done without the Divine auspices, is evident from the signification of "sending with Moses and 
with that nation," when sending by Jehovah is meant, as being that the Divine shall lead (of which in what follows), because Moses knew that he could indeed bring the people into the land of Canaan; but 
that if this were done without the Divine leading and auspices, they would not come into possession of it; which involves and signifies that the church would not be instituted with that nation (according 
to what was adduced above, n. 10559, 10560). From this it is evident that by "make this people come up, but Thou hast not made known to me whom Thou wilt send with me," is signified that the church 
could not be instituted with that nation without the Divine auspices. Thus do the angels perceive these words, howsoever they may be perceived by men; for the angels perceive all things of the Word 
according to its internal sense; but men according to the external sense, in which nevertheless is the internal. That "sending with them," when said of Jehovah, denotes that the Divine shall lead, 
is because by being "sent by Jehovah" is signified the Divine leading, and also the Divine proceeding. Therefore in the original tongue angels are so called from "sent," and therefore the Lord so frequently 
spoke of Himself as being "sent" by the Father, by which is signified the Divine proceeding (see n. 4710, 6831). From all this it is evident what is meant in the internal sense by "whom Thou wilt 
send with me." </p>

'And You have not made known to me whom You will send with me' means that without Divine direction that thing cannot be accomplished. This is clear from the meaning of 'sending with Moses and that nation', 
when done by Jehovah, as the Divine who will be their guide, dealt with below. For Moses knew that he was indeed able to lead the people into the land of Canaan, but that if he did so without Divine 
guidance and direction they would not enter into possession of it, which implies and means that the Church would not be established among that nation, in keeping with what has been brought forward 
above in <a href="10559.htm">10559</a>, <a href="10560.htm">10560</a>. From this it is evident that '[You say to me,] Cause this people to go up but You have not made known to me whom You will send with me' means that without Divine direction the 
Church could not be established among that nation. This is what angels see in these words, irrespective of what men see in them; for angels see all things in the Word according to its internal sense, 
whereas men see them according to its external sense, which however has the internal within it. The reason why 'sending with them', when done by Jehovah, means the Divine who will be their guide is 
that 'being sent by Jehovah' means the Divine acting as guide, as well as meaning the Divine going forth. This is why in the original language 'angels' are so called from the idea of being sent, and why 
the Lord said so frequently that He had been sent by the Father, meaning that He was the Divine going forth, see <a href="4710.htm">4710</a>, <a href="6831.htm">6831</a>. All this shows what 'will send with me' is used to mean in the internal sense.  </p>

`Et Tu non notum fecisti mihi quem missurus es cum me':  quod significet quod id absque auspicio Divino non fieri possit, constat ex significatione `mittere cum Mosche et gente illa' cum a Jehovah, 
quod sit Divinum quod ducet, de qua sequitur; et quia Moscheh sciebat quod quidem populum in terram Canaanem introducere posset, sed {1}si id fieret absque ductu et auspicio Divino, quod non venirent 
in possessionem ejus; quod involvit {2}et significat quod apud illam gentem non institueretur Ecclesia, secundum illa quae supra n. 10559, 10560, allata sunt; inde patet quod per `ascendere fac populum 
hunc, sed non notum fecisti mihi quem missurus es cum me' significetur quod Ecclesia apud illam gentem absque auspicio Divino non institui posset; ita angeli percipiunt haec verba qualitercumque homines, 
nam angeli {3}omnia Verbi secundum sensum internum ejus percipiunt, homines autem secundum sensum externum, in quo tamen internus.  Quod mittere cum illis, cum a Jehovah, sit Divinum quod ducet, 
est quia per `mitti a Jehovah' significatur Divinum ducens, et quoque Divinum procedens; {4}ideo angeli in lingua originali dicti sunt a mitti; (c)et ideo Dominus tam frequenter se {5}dixit missum a 
Patre, per quod significatur Divinum procedens, videatur n. 4710, 6831; ex his patet quid per `missurum cum me' in sensu interno intelligitur. @1 si non Divinum introduceret$ @2 in sensu interno$ @3 
secundum sensum internum illa$ @4 ideo id per angelos in Verbo intelligitur, nam angeli in Lingua originali vocantur a mitti$ @5 dixerat$   </p>
