<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9968节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9968.</strong>我到了那里后，没有看见这个星球本身，只看到来自该星球的灵人；因为如我前面几次提到的，每个星球的灵人都出现在他们自己星球的周围。其中一个原因是，他们由于生活状态的不同而具有不同的性情或性格；在来世，状态的不同将人们分开，而状态的相似将人们联结起来；另一个更重要的原因是，他们可以与自己星球的居民在一起，这些居民在性格或性情上与他们自己相似。因为没有人能离开灵人而存活，每个人都同类的灵人与他相联（参看<a href="5846.htm">5846</a>-<a href="5866.htm">5866</a>，<a href="5976.htm">5976</a>-<a href="5993.htm">5993</a>节）。这些灵人出现在头部层面之上相当高的地方，从那里清楚看到我的到来。<br />要知道，那些位于高处的人能清楚看见那些下面的人；并且他们越在高处，其视野就越开阔；他们不仅能清楚看到这些人，还能与他们交谈。他们从自己所在的地方发现我并非来自他们的星球，而是来自遥远的其它地方。因此，他们从那上面向我发话，问了各种问题，我也被允许一一作答。除此之外，我还告诉他们我来自哪个星球，该星球是何性质。后来，我与他们谈论我们太阳系中的星球，同时还谈论了水星灵，他们被允许周游众多星球，以获取关于各种事物的知识，这是他们的快乐（参看<a href="6808.htm">6808</a>-<a href="6817.htm">6817</a>，<a href="6921.htm">6921</a>-<a href="6932.htm">6932</a>，<a href="7069.htm">7069</a>-<a href="7079.htm">7079</a>节）。闻听此言，他们说，他们也曾在他们自己中间见过这些灵人。</p>

When I arrived there, the earth itself was not seen, but only the spirits from that earth; for as has already been observed several times, the spirits of every earth appear around their own earth, for 
the reason that they are of a diverse genius in consequence of a diverse state of life; and in the other life diversity of state disjoins, and likeness of state conjoins; and especially for the reason 
that they may be with the inhabitants of their own earth, who are of a similar genius. For a man cannot live apart from spirits, and spirits of a like nature are adjoined to everyone (see n. 5846-5866, 
5976-5993). These spirits appeared at a considerable height above the head, and from thence they looked at me as I was coming.  [2] Be it known that those who are on high can look at those who are 
below; and the greater their height, the farther their view extends; and that they can not only look at them, but can also speak with them. From their position they observed that I was not from their 
earth, but from a greater distance elsewhere; wherefore they addressed to me a variety of questions, to which it was also given me to reply. Among other things I told them from what earth I was, and 
what was its nature. Afterward I told them about the earths in our solar system, and at the same time also about the spirits of the earth or planet Mercury, to whom it is given to wander about to many 
earths for the sake of acquiring knowledges about various things, with which they are delighted (n. 6808-6817, 6921-6932, 7069-7079). When they heard this, they said that they also had seen these spirits 
among them. </p>

On my arrival there the actual planet did not appear, only spirits from that planet; for as I have noted several times previously, the spirits of each planet appear around their own planet. One reason 
for this is that being of differing character or disposition spirits differ as to their state of life (difference of state in the next life sets people apart, while likeness of state draws them together); 
and another more important reason is that they may be present with the inhabitants of their planet who are like themselves in character or disposition. For no person can live without spirits, and 
everyone has like spirits linked to him, see <a href="5846.htm">5846</a>-<a href="5866.htm">5866</a>, <a href="5976.htm">5976</a>-<a href="5993.htm">5993</a>. Those spirits appeared in a position very high above head-level, from where they had a clear view of me coming.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It should 
be remembered that those positioned high up can have a clear view of those who are below, and that the higher they are, the wider their view is; and not only do they have a clear view of them, they can 
also speak to them. They observed from where they were that I was not from their planet but from somewhere else far away. Consequently they addressed me from up there, asking about various matters to 
which I was also allowed to reply. Among other things I told them what planet I was from and what it was like. After that I spoke about the planets in our solar system, and at the same time also about 
the spirits of the planet Mercury, who are allowed to wander around to very many planets, gathering items of knowledge about different things, as is their delight, see <a href="6808.htm">6808</a>-<a href="6817.htm">6817</a>, <a href="6921.htm">6921</a>-<a href="6932.htm">6932</a>, <a href="7069.htm">7069</a>-<a href="7079.htm">7079</a>. 
On hearing this they said that they too had seen them among themselves.  </p>

Quando illuc perventum est, non visa est tellus, sed visi spiritus ex illa tellure, nam ut prius aliquoties observatum est, spiritus cujusvis telluris apparent circa suam tellurem, ex causa quia diverso 
genio sunt ex diverso statu vitae, ac diversitas status in altera vita disjungit et similitudo status conjungit; et imprimis ex causa ut sint apud incolas suae telluris qui simili genio sunt, homo 
enim absque spiritibus non potest vivere, ac spiritus similes cuivis adjunguntur, videatur n. 5846-5866, 5976-5993. Visi sunt spiritus illi admodum alte supra caput, et inde me venientem perspexerunt. 	2 
Sciendum est quod qui in alto sunt perspicere possint illos qui infra sunt, et quo in altiore, eo latius; et quod non modo possint perspicere illos, sed etiam loqui cum illis. Observabant inde 
quod non ex eorum tellure essem sed e longinquo aliunde; quapropter me inde allocuti sunt, interrogando de variis, ad quae etiam respondere datum est; et inter alia narrabam illis ex qua tellure essem, 
et qualis ea esset; et postea dicebam de telluribus in nostro mundo solari, et tunc quoque de spiritibus telluris seu planetae Mercurii, quibus datur pervagari ad plures tellures ad comparandas sibi 
cognitiones rerum variarum, quibus delectantur, de quibus n. 6808-6817, 6921-6932, 7069-7079; cum id audiebant, dicebant quod etiam illos apud se viderint. </p>
