<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9502节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9502.</strong>“不可抽出来”表永恒，不可改变。这从“不可抽出来”的含义清楚可知，“不可抽出来”是指存在和持续存在，永远且不可改变。因为总体和具体地包围并容纳天堂的良善和真理的神性气场使天堂存在并创造了它；也正是这气场使天堂持续存在并维护它；因为持续存在就是永恒存在，维护就是永恒创造。“不可抽出来”的杠就表示永恒并不可改变；在基路伯翅膀下面并被它们遮掩的杠代表通过从主发出的良善和真理的神性气场对天堂的永恒保护，这明显可见于列王纪：<br />基路伯张着翅膀，以致基路伯从上面遮掩约柜和抬柜的杠。这杠伸出来，杠头在内殿前的圣所可以看见，从外面却看不见。（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上8.7.htm">8:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上8.8.htm">8</a>）</p>

They shall not be removed from it. That this signifies forever without change, is evident from the signification of "not being removed," as being the coming-forth and subsistence forever and without 
change. For heaven came forth and was created through the Divine sphere of good and truth that encompasses and encloses heaven in general and in particular; and through the same sphere it subsists and 
is preserved; for subsistence is a perpetual coming-forth, and preservation is a perpetual creation. Perpetuity without change was represented by the non-removal of the staves from the ark; and the eternal 
protection of heaven through the Divine sphere of good and truth from the Lord was represented by the staves being under the wings of the cherubs, and by their being "covered;" as is evident from 
the first book of Kings: </p>
<p>     The cherubs spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, so that the cherubs covered the ark and the staves thereof from above. And the staves were drawn out, 
and the heads of the staves were seen from the holy place toward the faces of the sanctuary; but they were not seen without (1 Kings 8:7, 8). </p>

'They must not be removed from it' means everlastingly and unalterably so. This is clear from the meaning of 'not being removed' as being brought into being and kept in being, everlastingly and unalterably. 
For the Divine sphere of goodness and truth encompassing and embracing heaven generally and specifically brought heaven into being and created it, and that same sphere keeps it in being and preserves 
it; for to keep something in being is to go on bringing it into being, everlastingly so, and to preserve it is to go on creating it, everlastingly so. The everlastingness and unalterableness was 
represented by the poles' not being removed from the ark, and the eternal protection of heaven by the Divine sphere of goodness and truth emanating from the Lord was represented by the poles' being 
under and covered by the wings of the cherubs, as is clear in the first Book of Kings,  </p>
<p>The cherubs were spreading out their wings over the place of the ark, so that the cherubs covered the ark and 
its poles from above; the poles indeed extended, and the ends<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the poles were seen from the holy place in front of the shrine, but were not seen from outside. <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 8:7, <a href="8.htm">8</a>.

`Non removebuntur ab ea': quod significet in perpetuum absque mutatione, constat ex significatione `non removeri' quod sit existentia et subsistentia {1} in perpetuum et absque mutatione, nam per sphaeram 
Divinam boni et veri ambientem et includentem caelum in communi et in particulari exstitit {2}et creatum est caelum, et per eandem subsistit et conservatur; nam subsistentia est perpetua existentia, 
et conservatio est perpetua creatio; perpetuitas absque mutatione repraesentata est per non remotionem vectium ab arca, et protectio aeterna caeli per (t)Divinam sphaeram boni et veri a Domino repraesentata 
est per quod vectes essent sub alis cheruborum, et tegerentur, ut constat in Libro 1 Regum, Cherubi expandentes alas super locum arcae, ita ut obtegerent cherubi arcam, et vectes ejus desuper; 
protendebantur quidem vectes, et videbantur capita vectium ex sancto versus facies adyti, non autem videbantur foris, viii 7, 8. @1 i inde$ @2 seu$ </p>
