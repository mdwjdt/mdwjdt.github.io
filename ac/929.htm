<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第929节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>929.</strong>“我也再不照我所作的打击一切生物了”表人再也不会如此毁灭自己了。这一点从前面所述清楚可知。情况乃是这样：人重生后，会从恶与假中退离，这时，他只感觉凭自己行善思真。然而，这不过是一个表象或错觉，因为他正受到恶与假强有力地影响。由于从恶与假中退离，所以他无法毁灭自己。但是，倘若约束他的缰绳哪怕放松那么一点点，或他真的远离了，那他会冲向一切恶与假。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]929.</strong> The meaning of I will not strike every living thing again as I have done as the fact that people could no longer destroy themselves in this way now stands out clearly.<br />This is the situation: When we have regenerated, we are held back from the evil and falsity that are in us. Under those circumstances, we are conscious only of doing and thinking what is good and true on our own, but this is an appearance, an illusion. It is the result of being held back from evil and falsity, and held back with great force. What is more, since we are withheld from evil and falsity, we cannot destroy ourselves. If we were given leeway or left on our own to even a slight extent, we would plunge into all possible evil and falsity. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 929</b></p><p><b>929.</b>
Neither will I again smite anymore everything living, as I have done. That this signifies that man would not be able anymore so to destroy himself, is now evident, for such is the case when man is regenerated, 
seeing that he is then withheld from the evil and falsity that is with him, and then perceives no otherwise than that he does what is good and thinks what is true from himself. This however 
is an appearance, or fallacy, owing to his being withheld (as indeed he is, powerfully), and in consequence of being thus withheld from evil and falsity, he cannot destroy himself; but if he were in 
the least let go, or left to himself, he would rush into all evil and falsity. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 929</b></p><p><b>929.</b>
'I will no more strike every living thing, as I have done' means that man would never again be able to destroy himself in that way. This is now clear from what has been said above. The situation is this: 
When a person has been regenerated he is withheld from the evil and falsity residing with him. At this point he does not perceive anything other than that he does good and thinks truth from himself. 
This however is an appearance or illusion, for he is being held back from evil and falsity, powerfully so. And being withheld from evil and falsity he cannot destroy himself. If that rein on him were 
slackened in the least or if he were abandoned to himself he would rush into every evil and falsity. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 929</b>
</p><b>929.</b>
Quod 'non addam percutere omne vivum sicut feci' significet quod homo non amplius ita se perdere poterit, inde nunc constat: ita enim se res habet; cum homo regeneratus est, tunc detinetur a malo et 
falso quod apud eum, et tunc non percipit aliter quam quod bonum et verum a se faciat et cogitet, sed est apparentia seu fallacia, est detentio a malo et falso, et quidem valida; et quia detinetur a 
malo et falso, non potest se perdere; si vel minimum remitteretur aut relinqueretur sibi, in omne malum et falsum rueret. </p>
