<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>563.</strong>一旦这种信念将人掌控，就会象胶水一样，紧紧粘住原本要作为余留的良善与真理，结果，余留再也无法被储存起来；已储存的那些毫无用处。因此，当这样的信念达到顶点时，他们就自取灭亡，被大洪水淹没。所以，他们的灭绝好比一场洪水，按照上古之人的习惯，也被描述为“大洪水”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]563.</strong> Should this kind of self-deception take over, it acts like a glue, and the good feelings and true thoughts that should be our remnant adhere to it. Then remnants can no longer be stored away, and what has already been stored away becomes unavailable. As a result, when people arrived at the height of this kind of delusion, they annihilated themselves and drowned in an inundation not unlike the Flood. Their extinction is compared to a flood for this reason and, in keeping with the custom of the earliest people, is also depicted as a flood. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 563</b></p><p><b>563.</b>
When such a persuasion takes possession of a man, it is like a glue which catches in its sticky embrace the goods and truths that otherwise would be remains, the result of which is that remains can no 
longer be stored up, and those which have been stored up can be of no use; and therefore when these people arrived at the summit of such persuasion they became extinct of their own accord, and were 
suffocated by an inundation not unlike a flood; and therefore their extinction is compared to a "flood" and also, according to the custom of the most ancient people, is described as one. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 563</b></p><p><b>563.</b>
When such persuasion gets a hold on someone it is like glue in which the goods and truths that would otherwise be remnants are stuck fast, and as a result remnants can no longer be stored away; and those 
that have been stored away cannot be of any use. For this reason when those people reached the summit of such persuasion they underwent annihilation caused by themselves, and were drowned by an inundation 
not unlike a flood. This is why their annihilation is compared to a flood, and is also described, according to the custom of the most ancient people, as 'the Flood'.

</p><b>563.</b>
Cum talis persuasio occupat hominem, tunc est sicut gluten, cui inviscantur bona et vera quae forent reliquiae, sic ut reliquiae non amplius recondi et quae reconditae non usui esse possint; quare etiam 
cum ad summum talis persuasionis pervenerunt, ex semet exstincti sunt, et suffocati sicut inundatione non dissimili diluvio; ideo eorum exstinctio diluvio comparatur, et quoque ad morem antiquissimorum 
per 'diluvium' describitur. </p>
