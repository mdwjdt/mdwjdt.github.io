<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3024节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3024.</strong>“不要从迦南人的女子中为我儿子娶一个妻子”表凡与真理不一致的情感，神圣理性都不可与之结合。这从“娶一个妻子”、“我的儿子”、“女子（或女儿）”，以及“迦南人”的含义清楚可知：“娶一个妻子”是指凭婚约联结；“我的儿子”，就是以撒，是指主的神圣理性（参看<a href="1893.htm">1893</a>，<a href="2066.htm">2066</a>，<a href="2083.htm">2083</a>，<a href="2630.htm">2630</a>节）；“女子（或女儿）”是指情感（参看<a href="489.htm">489</a>-<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="568.htm">568</a>，<a href="2362.htm">2362</a>节）；“迦南人”是指邪恶（参看<a href="1444.htm">1444</a>，<a href="1573.htm">1573</a>，<a href="1574.htm">1574</a>节）；因此“迦南人的女子”是指与真理不一致的情感。此处论述的主题是要与主神圣理性良善联结的神圣真理，这从概览（<a href="3013.htm">3013</a>节）可以看出来。要凭婚约联结的“女人”表示要从属世人经由正常渠道被召唤出来的真理本身。“我的儿子”表示主理性的良善，主的理性要与这良善结合或联结。由此可知“不要从迦南人的女子中娶一个妻子”意思是，凡与真理不一致的情感，神圣理性都不可与之结合。真理与良善的一切结合都是藉着情感实现的，若不藉着情感，真理绝无可能进入人心智的理性部分，或与之结合。因为爱之善在情感里面，而唯独这善产生结合（<a href="1895.htm">1895</a>节）。只要停下来思考一下，谁都能知道这一点<br />至于“迦南人的女子”表示与真理不一致的情感，也就是对虚假的情感，这从“女子或女儿”的含义明显可知。“女子或女儿”在圣言多处被提及，谁都能看出，女子或女儿在那里并不是指女子或女儿。诸如“锡安的女子或女儿”、“耶路撒冷的女子或女儿”、“他施的女子或女儿”、“我民的女子或女儿”这类表述，均表示对良善与真理的情感，如上述内容所说明的。它们因表示对良善与真理的情感，故也表示教会，因为教会凭这些情感而成为教会。因此，“锡安的女子或女儿”凭对良善的情感而表示属天教会；“耶路撒冷的女子或女儿”凭对真理的情感而表示属灵教会（<a href="2362.htm">2362</a>节）。“我民的女子或女儿”也一样（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛22.4.htm">22:4</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶6.14.htm">6:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶6.26.htm">26</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶8.19.htm">8:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶8.21.htm">21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶8.22.htm">22</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶9.1.htm">9:1</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶14.17.htm">14:17</a>；耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.11.htm">2:11</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀4.6.htm">4:6</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结13.17.htm">13:17</a>）。<br />由此明显可知何谓列族（或列国）的“女子或女儿”，如“非利士人的女子或女儿”、“埃及的女子或女儿”、“推罗和西顿的女子或女儿”、“以东的女子或女儿”、“摩押的女子或女儿”、“迦勒底人的女子或女儿”、“巴别或巴比伦的女子或女儿”、“所多玛的女子或女儿”。她们均表示对邪恶与虚假的情感，正是这些情感孕育出他们的各种宗教体系，因此，这些“女子或女儿”也表示这些宗教体系本身。从以下经文可以看出，这就是“女子或女儿”的含义。以西结书：<br />列族的女子为埃及悲哀。你要为埃及群众哀号，又要将她，将埃及和名族的女子，并下坑的人，都送下低地。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结32.16.htm">32:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结32.18.htm">18</a>）<br />“名族的女子”表对邪恶的情感。撒母耳记：<br />不要在迦特报告，不要在亚实基伦街上传扬；免得非利士的女子快乐，免得未受割礼之人的女子矜夸。（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下1.20.htm">1:20</a>）<br />以西结书：<br />你也和埃及人行淫；我将你交给恨你的非利士众女，使她们任意待你。你的罪恶没有被揭露以前，亚兰众女和亚兰四围的众人受了凌辱的时候，四围非利士的众女都藐视你。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.26.htm">16:26</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.27.htm">27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.57.htm">57</a>）<br />谁都能看出，此处并非指女子，而是指诸如非利士人所表示那类人当中的各种宗教。这种人反复谈论信，却根本不追求信所教导的生活（参看<a href="1197.htm">1197</a>，<a href="1198.htm">1198</a>节）。因此，他们也被称为“未受割礼之人”，也就是缺乏仁爱之人。<br />耶利米书：<br />埃及的处女哪，可以上基列取乳香去。住在埃及的女子哪，要预备掳去时所用的物件。埃及的女子必然蒙羞，必交在北方人的手中。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶46.11.htm">46:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶46.19.htm">19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶46.24.htm">24</a>）<br />“埃及的女（子）”表示对推理的情感，就是基于记忆知识对信之真理是否真实的推理；因此她表示由此产生的宗教种类，这类宗教的性质是，若不为感官理解，就什么也不信，因而不相信任何信之真理（参看<a href="215.htm">215</a>，<a href="232.htm">232</a>，<a href="233.htm">233</a>，<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>，<a href="1385.htm">1385</a>，<a href="2196.htm">2196</a>，<a href="2203.htm">2203</a>，<a href="2209.htm">2209</a>，<a href="2568.htm">2568</a>，<a href="2588.htm">2588</a>节）。以赛亚书：<br />他说，你必不得再快乐，你这受欺压西顿的女子哪。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.12.htm">23:12</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />推罗的女子必来送礼，民中的富足人也必求你的情面。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗45.12.htm">45:12</a>）<br />从西顿和推罗的含义明显可知何谓“西顿的女子”和“推罗的女子”（参看<a href="1201.htm">1201</a>节）。耶利米哀歌：<br />以东的女子哪，只管欢喜快乐。锡安的女子哪，你罪孽的刑罚受足了。祂必不使你再流亡；以东的女子哪，你的罪孽必追讨。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀4.21.htm">4:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀4.22.htm">22</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />摩押的女子必像游飞的鸟，离散的巢。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛16.2.htm">16:2</a>）<br /><br />巴比伦的处女啊，下来坐在尘埃；迦勒底的女儿啊，没有宝座，要坐在地上。迦勒底的女儿啊，你要默然静坐，进入黑暗中，因为你不再称为列国的主母。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛47.1.htm">47:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛47.5.htm">5</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />巴比伦的女子哪，有一种民从北方而来，都列阵如上战场的人，要攻击你。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.41.htm">50:41</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.42.htm">42</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />巴比伦女子好像踹谷的禾场；收割她的时候到了。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.33.htm">51:33</a>）<br />撒迦利亚书：<br />嗨！与巴比伦的女子同住的锡安哪，应当逃脱。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚2.7.htm">2:7</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />巴比伦的女子被毁灭。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗137.8.htm">137:8</a>）<br />以西结书：<br />你的妹妹所多玛和她的众女必恢复原状；撒马利亚和她的众女，你和你的众女也必必恢复原状。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.55.htm">16:55</a>）<br />谁都能看出，在上述经文中，“女子”并非指女子，而是指与真理不一致的情感，因而是指源于这些情感的宗教种类。不过，这些宗教的具体种类从这些人民的含义明显可知，如以东、摩押、迦勒底人、巴别或巴比伦、所多玛、撒玛利亚。我们解释创世记前面的章节时已在各处论述了这些名字的含义。由此明显可知，此处“迦南人的女子”是什么意思。<br />以色列人不可与迦南人的女子通婚，这个命令还与属灵的法则有关，即：良善与虚假、邪恶与真理不可联结，因为这类联结会导致亵渎。这个禁令也是申命记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.3.htm">7:3</a>）所提及之事的代表。在玛拉基书：<br />犹大人亵渎耶和华的圣洁，因为他喜爱并娶了外邦神的女子。（玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛2.11.htm">2:11</a>）</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3024</b></p><p><b>3024.</b>
That thou shalt not take a woman for my son of the daughters of the Canaanite. That this signifies that the Divine rational was not to be conjoined with any affection disagreeing with truth, is evident 
from the signification of "taking a woman," as being to be conjoined by a covenant of marriage; from the signification of "my son," namely Isaac, as being the Lord's Divine rational (see n. 1893, 2066, 
2083, 2630); from the signification of "daughters," as being affections (see n. 489-491, 568, 2362); and from the signification of the "Canaanite," as being evil (see n. 1444, 1573, 1574); from which 
it is that the "daughters of the Canaanite" are affections that do not agree with truth. The subject here treated of is the Divine truth that was to be adjoined to the Divine good of the Lord's rational, 
as may be seen from the Contents (n. 3013). By the "woman" who was to be associated by a covenant of marriage, is meant that truth itself, which was to be called forth from the natural man by 
the common way; by "my son" is meant the Lord's rational in respect to good, to which it was to be adjoined or associated; hence it may be known that by "not taking a woman from the daughters of the 
Canaanite," is signified that this rational was not to be conjoined with any affection that disagreed with truth. All conjunction of truth with good is effected by means of affection; for no truth can 
possibly enter into man's rational and be conjoined there, except by means of affection; for in affection is the good of love, which alone conjoins (n. 1895); as may also be known to anyone who reflects. [2] 
That the "daughters of the Canaanite" signify affections which disagree with truth, that is, affections of what is false, is evident from the signification of "daughters;" for daughters are 
mentioned in many passages of the Word, and everyone can see that daughters are not there meant, as where it is said, the "daughter of Zion," the "daughter of Jerusalem," the "daughter of Tarshish," the 
"daughter of My people." That by these are signified affections of good and of truth, has been shown in passages quoted above. And because they are affections of good and of truth, they are also churches, 
for churches are churches from these affections. Thus by the "daughter of Zion" is signified the celestial church, and this from the affection of good; but by the "daughter of Jerusalem" is signified 
the spiritual church, from the affection of truth (n. 2362); this is also signified by the "daughter of My people" (Isa. 22:4; Jer. 6:14, 26; 8:19, 21-22; 14:17; Lam. 2:11; 4:6; Ezek. 13:17). [3] 
From this it is evident what is signified by the "daughters" of the nations; as by the "daughters of the Philistines," the "daughters of Egypt," the "daughters of Tyre and of Zidon," the "daughters 
of Edom," the "daughters of Moab," the "daughters of the Chaldeans" and "of Babel," and the "daughters of Sodom," namely, the affections of evil and falsity from which were their religious systems, 
and thus the religious systems themselves. That such is the signification of "daughters," may be seen from the passages that follow. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     The daughters of the nations shall lament for Egypt. 
Wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cause her to go down, her and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the earth of the regions below, with them that go down into the pit (Ezek. 32:16, 18). The 
"daughters of the famous nations" denote the affections of evil. In Samuel: </p>
<p>     Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest 
the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph (2 Sam. 1:20). In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Thou hast committed whoredom with the sons of Egypt; I have delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters 
of the Philistines, before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines which 
do despite unto thee round about (Ezek. 16:26-27, 57). That daughters are not meant here, anyone can see; but the religiosities of such as are signified by the Philistines, which are of such a kind that 
they talk much about faith and lead no life of faith (see n. 1197, 1198); for this reason they are also called the "uncircumcised," that is, those who are devoid of charity. [4] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>   
  Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt. O thou daughter that dwellest in Egypt, make thee vessels of exile. The daughter of Egypt shall be put to shame, she is delivered into the 
hand of the people of the north (Jer. 46:11, 19, 24). The "daughter of Egypt" denotes the affection of reasoning from memory-knowledges concerning the truths of faith, as to whether they be so; thus 
she denotes the kind of religion that arises from this, which is such that nothing is believed except that which is comprehended by the senses, and thus nothing of the truth of faith (see n. 215, 232, 
233, 1164, 1165, 1186, 1385, 2196, 2203, 2209, 2568, 2588). [5] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     He said, Thou shalt no more exult, O thou oppressed daughter of Zidon (Isa. 23:12). And in David: </p>
<p>     The daughter 
of Tyre with a gift, the rich among the people shall entreat thy faces (Ps. 45:12). What is meant by the "daughter of Zidon" and the "daughter of Tyre," is evident from the signification of Zidon 
and of Tyre (see n. 1201). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Rejoice and be glad O daughter of Edom. Thine iniquity is consummated, O daughter of Zion. He will no more cause thee to migrate; thine iniquity shall be 
visited, O daughter of Edom (Lam. 4:21-22). In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     As a wandering bird, a nest sent forth, shall the daughters of Moab be (Isa. 16:2). Again: </p>
<p>     Come down and sit in the dust, O virgin 
daughter of Babel; sit on the earth, without a throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans. Sit thou silent, and enter into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans, for thou shalt no more be called the lady of 
kingdoms (Isa. 47:1, 5). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     A people cometh from the north set in array as a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babel (Jer. 50:41-42).      The daughter of Babel is like 
a threshing-floor, it is time to thresh her (Jer. 51:33). In Zechariah: </p>
<p>     Alas O Zion, escape, thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babel (Zech. 2:7). In David: </p>
<p>     The daughter of Babel is 
laid waste (Ps. 137:8). In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their ancient estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their ancient estate (Ezek. 16:55). [6] 
Anyone can see that in these passages by "daughters" are not meant daughters, but affections that disagree with truth, and thus religiosities that come from this source; but what these religiosities 
are, is evident from the signification of the peoples named-as Edom, Moab, the Chaldeans, Babel, Sodom, and Samaria, which have been treated of in many places in the explications of the foregoing 
chapters of Genesis. Hence now it is evident what is here meant by the "daughters of the Canaanite." [7] That the Israelites were not to contract marriages with the daughters of the Canaanites, also 
had regard to the spiritual laws that good and falsity, and evil and truth are not to be joined together; for thence comes profanation. The prohibition was also representative of the matter concerning 
which we read in Deuteronomy 7:3; and in Malachi: </p>
<p>     Judah hath profaned the holiness of Jehovah, in that he hath loved and hath married the daughter of a strange god (Mal. 2:11). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3024</b></p><p><b>3024.</b>
'That you do not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites' means that the Divine Rational should not be joined to any affection incompatible with truth. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'taking a woman' as being joined by means of the marriage covenant; from the meaning of 'my son', namely Isaac, as the Lord's Divine Rational, dealt with in <a href="1893.htm">1893</a>, <a href="2066.htm">2066</a>, <a href="2083.htm">2083</a>, <a href="2630.htm">2630</a>; from the meaning 
of 'daughters' as affections, dealt with in <a href="489.htm">489</a>-<a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="568.htm">568</a>, <a href="2362.htm">2362</a>; and from the meaning of 'the Canaanites' as evil, dealt with in <a href="1444.htm">1444</a>, <a href="1573.htm">1573</a>, <a href="1574.htm">1574</a>. Consequently 'the daughters of the Canaanites' are 
affections incompatible with truth. The subject here is Divine truth which was to be allied to the Divine good of the Lord's Rational, as may be seen in <a href="3013.htm">3013</a> under 'Contents'. 'A woman' who was to be 
associated by means of a marriage covenant is used to mean that truth itself which is summoned from the natural man in the normal manner. 'My son' is used to mean the Lord's Rational as regards the good 
with which it was to be allied or associated. From this one may recognize that the command not to take a wife for his son from the daughters of the Canaanites means that the Divine Rational should 
not be joined to any affection incompatible with truth. All joining of truth to good is effected by means of affection, for no truth ever enters the rational part of a person's mind or is joined to it 
except by means of affection, for affection has within it the good that flows from love, which good alone effects the joining together, <a href="1895.htm">1895</a>, as also anyone may know who stops to reflect on it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
As regards 'the daughters of the Canaanites' meaning affections incompatible with truth, that is, affections for what is false, this becomes clear from the meaning of 'daughters'. For the noun 'daughters' 
occurs in many places in the Word, and in these anyone may see that it is not used to mean daughters. By such expressions as 'the daughter of Zion', 'the daughter of Jerusalem', 'the daughter 
of Tarshish', 'the daughter of My people', affections for good and truth are meant, as shown in the paragraphs referred to above. And since affections for good and truth are meant so also are Churches, 
for Churches are Churches by virtue of these affections. Consequently 'the daughter of Zion' means the celestial Church, and means this by virtue of the affection for good, whereas 'the daughter of 
Jerusalem' means the spiritual Church from the affection for truth, <a href="2362.htm">2362</a>. And it is the same with 'the daughter of My people' in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2022:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 22:4</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%206:14,%2026;%208:19,%2021,%2022;%209:1;%2014:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 6:14, 26; 8:19, 21, 22; 9:1; 14:17</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lam%202:11;%204:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lam 2:11; 4:6</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2013:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 13:17</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 This shows what is meant by the daughters of the nations, such as by the daughters of the Philistines, the daughters of Egypt, the daughters of Tyre and Sidon, the daughters of Edom, 
the daughters of Moab, the daughters of the Chaldeans and Babel, and the daughters of Sodom. They mean affections for evil and falsity, from which their varieties of religion sprang, and so mean those 
varieties themselves. That this is the meaning of 'daughters' becomes clear from the following places: In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
The daughters of the nations will lament over Egypt. Wail over the multitude of Egypt, 
and send her down, her and the daughters of majestic nations, to the lower earth, together with those who go down to the pit. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2032:16,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 32:16, 18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The daughters of majestic nations' stands for affections 
for evil. In Samuel, </p>
<blockquote>
Tell it not in Gath; publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised exult. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2%20Sam%201:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">2 Sam 1:20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In 
Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
You committed whoredom with the sons of Egypt. I delivered you to those who hated you, the daughters of the Philistines. Before your badness was revealed, as at the time of the 
reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all round about her, the daughters of the Philistines who despise you from round about. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2016:26,%2027,%2057&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 16:26, 27, 57</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone may see that not daughters were meant 
here but the varieties of religion among such people as are meant by the Philistines - those who speak repeatedly of faith yet do not at all pursue the life taught by faith, see <a href="1197.htm">1197</a>, <a href="1198.htm">1198</a>. This also 
explains why they are called 'the uncircumcised', that is, devoid of charity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Go up to Gilead and take balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt! Make for yourself vessels of migration, 
O inhabitant daughter of Egypt. The daughter of Egypt has been put to shame; she has been delivered into the hand of the people from the north. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2046:11,%2019,%2024&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 46:11, 19, 24</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The daughter of Egypt' stands for 
the affection for reasoning from facts about whether truths of faith really are true, and so stands for the variety of religion which springs from this, the nature of which is to believe nothing except 
that grasped by the senses, and so to believe nothing of the truth of faith, see <a href="215.htm">215</a>, <a href="232.htm">232</a>, <a href="233.htm">233</a>, <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>, <a href="1385.htm">1385</a>, <a href="2196.htm">2196</a>, <a href="2203.htm">2203</a>, <a href="2209.htm">2209</a>, <a href="2568.htm">2568</a>, <a href="2588.htm">2588</a>.

<p><b>[5]</b>
 Anyone may see that in these places 'daughters' is not used to mean daughters but affections incompatible with truth, 
and so the varieties of religion that spring from them. But which particular varieties they are is evident from the meaning of those peoples - from the meaning of Edom, Moab, the Chaldeans, Babel, Sodom, 
Samaria, all of which have been dealt with in various places in the explanations to previous chapters of Genesis. From this what is meant in the present chapter by 'the daughters of the Canaanites' 
becomes clear. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 This command not to contract marriages with the daughters of the Canaanites also had regard to the spiritual requirements that good should not be joined to falsity, nor evil to 
truth, for the result of any such joining together is profanation. The prohibition was also a representative of the matter referred to in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%207:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 7:3</a>, and in Malachi, </p>
<p>Judah has profaned the holiness 
of Jehovah, in that he loved and married the daughter of a foreign god. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mal%202:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mal 2:11</a>. </p>

Quod `non accipias mulierem filio meo e filiabus Canaanitae' significet quod Rationale Divinum non conjungeretur alicui affectioni quae cum vero discordat, constat a significatione `accipere mulierem' 
quod sit conjungi per foedus conjugii; ex significatione `filii mei,' nempe Jishaki, quod sit Rationale Divinum Domini, de qua n. 1893, 2066, 2083, 2630; a significatione `filiarum' quod sint affectiones, 
de qua n. 489-491, 568, 2362: et a significatione `Canaanitae' quod sit malum, de qua n. 1444, 1573, 1574; inde est quod `filiae Canaanitae' sint affectiones quae a vero discordant.  Agitur hic 
de vero Divino quod adjungendum bono Divino Rationalis Domini, ut videri potest a contentis n. 3013; per `mulierem' quae foedere conjugii associanda, intelligitur ipsum illud verum quod per viam communem 
ex naturali homine evocandum; per `filium meum' intelligitur Rationale Domini quoad bonum cui adjungendum seu associandum; inde scire potest {1}quod per `non acciperet mulierem filio e filiabus 
Canaanitae,' significetur quod non conjungeretur alicui affectioni quae a vero discordat; omnis conjunctio veri cum bono fit per affectionem, nusquam enim aliquod verum intrat in rationale hominis et 
ibi conjungitur nisi per affectionem, nam in affectione est bonum amoris, quod unice conjungit, n. 1895, quod etiam notum potest esse {2}ei qui reflectit.  [2] Quod `filiae Canaanitae' significent affectiones 
quae a vero discordant, hoc est, affectiones falsi, constare potest a significatione `filiarum'; filiae enim in Verbo multis {3}locis nominantur, et quisque ibi videre potest quod non filiae 
intelligantur, sicut filia Zionis, filia Hierosolymae, filia Tarshish, filia populi Mei, quae quod sint affectiones boni et veri, in locis supra adductis ostensum est; et quia sunt affectiones boni et 
veri, etiam sunt Ecclesiae, nam Ecclesiae sunt Ecclesiae ex affectionibus illis; inde est quod per `filiam Zionis' significetur Ecclesia caelestis, et hoc ex affectione boni; per `filiam autem Hierosolymae' 
Ecclesia spiritualis, ex affectione veri, n. 2362, (m)etiam per filiam populi Mei, Esai. xxii 4; Jer. vi 14, 26; viii 19, 21-23; xiv 17; Thren. ii 11; iv 6; Ezech. xiii 17(n).  [3] Inde patet 
quid per filias gentium, ut per `filias Philistaeorum, filias Aegypti, filias Tyri et Zidonis, filias Edomi, filias Moabi, filias Chaldaeorum et Babelis, filias Sodomae' significatur, quod nempe affectiones 
mali et falsi, ex quibus religiosa illorum, ita ipsa religiosa; quod haec sit significatio filiarum, constare potest ab his locis; (m)apud Ezechielem,           Filiae gentium lamentabuntur Aegyptum,...plange 
super       multitudine Aegypti, et descendere fac illam, illam et filias      gentium magnificarum ad terram inferiorum cum descendentibus      foveam, xxxii 16, 18; </p>
<p>`filiae gentium 
magnificarum' pro affectionibus mali: apud Samuelem,            Ne indicate in Gath, ne evangelizate in plateis      Askalonis, forte gaudent filiae Philistaeorum,...forte      exsultant filiae 
praeputiatorum, 2 Sam. i 20: </p>
<p>apud Ezechielem,           Scortata es cum filiis Aegypti,...dedi te in animam       odentium te, filiarum Philistaeorum,...antequam revelaretur      malum tuum, sicut 
tempus ignominiae filiarum Syriae, et omnium      circuituum ejus, filiarum Philistaeorum contemnentium te e      circuitu, xvi 26, 27, 57; </p>
<p>quod non filiae hic intellectae sint, quisque videre potest, 
sed quod religiosa talium qui significantur per `Philistaeos,' quae talia quod multum loquantur de fide, et nullam fidei vitam agunt, videatur n. 1197, 1198; inde etiam dicti sunt `praeputiati,' 
hoc est, absque charitate: [4] apud Jeremiam,           Ascende Gilead, et sume balsamum virgo filia      Aegypti....Vasa migrationis fac tibi habitatrix filia Aegypti.      Pudefacta est filia Aegypti,...data 
in manum populi      septentrionis, xlvi 11, 19, 24; </p>
<p>`filia Aegypti' pro affectione ratiocinandi de veris fidei num ita sit, ex scientificis; ita pro religioso quod inde exsurgit, quod 
tale est `quod nihil credatur nisi quod sensibus capitur, ita nihil veri fidei, videatur n. 215, 232, 233, 1164, 1165, 1386, 1385, 2196, 2203, 2209, 2568, 2588: apud Esaiam,           Dixit, Non {5}addes 
amplius exsultare oppressa virgo filia Zidonis, xxiii 12: </p>
<p>apud Davidem,           Filia Tyri in munere, facies tuas deprecabuntur divites      populi, Ps. xlv 13 [A.V. 12]; </p>
<p>quid filia Zidonis 
et filia Tyri, patet a significatione Zidonis et Tyri, de qua n. 1201 apud Jeremiam,           Gaude et laetare filia Edomi;...consummata est      iniquitas tua filia Zionis, non addet migrare facere 
te,      visitabitur iniquitas tua filia Edomi, Thren. iv [21], 22: </p>
<p>apud Esaiam,           Sicut avis vagabunda, nidus emissus, erunt filiae       Moabi, xvi 2: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           Descende 
et sede super pulvere virgo filia Babelis,       sede ad terram, non thronus, filia Chaldaeorum....Sede silens,      et intra in tenebras filia Chaldaeorum, quia non addes, vocent      te dominam 
regnorum, xlvii 1, 5: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam,           Populus veniens e septentrione,...ordinatus sicut vir       ad bellum, super te filia Babelis, l 41, 42 apud eundem,           Filia Babelis sicut 
area, tempus ad triturandum eam, li 33: apud Zachariam,           Heu Zion eripe te, habitans cum filia Babelis, ii 11 [A.V.ii 7]: </p>
<p>apud Davidem,           Filia Babelis vastata est, Ps. cxxxvii 
8: </p>
<p>apud Ezechielem,           Sorores tuae, Sodoma et filiae ejus redibunt ad      antiquum suum; et Samaria et filiae ejus redibunt ad      antiquum suum, xvi 55; </p>
<p>quod {6}in his locis per `filias' 
non filiae intellectae sint, quisque (t)videre potest, sed quod affectiones quae a vero discordant, ita religiosa quae sunt inde; [5] quaenam autem religiosa sunt, patet a significatione illorum populorum, 
ut ab Edomi, Moabi, Chaldaeorum, Babelis, Sodomae, Samariae, de quibus passim in explicationibus ad capita priora Geneseos: inde nunc constat quid per `filias Canaanitae' hic loci significatur. 
Quod non contraherent matrimonia cum filiabus 6 Canaanitarum, spectabat quoque illa spiritualia, quod bonum et falsum, ac malum et verum, non conjungerentur, inde enim profanatio; prohibitio etiam 
erat repraesentativum illius rei, de qua Deut. vii 3, et apud (x)Malachiam,           Profanavit Jehudah sanctitatem Jehovae, quod amavit et      maritavit filiam dei alieni, ii 11. @1 A had quod
