<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2306节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2306.</strong>至于小孩子的纯真，它尚缺乏聪明和智慧，只是接受真正纯真的一个层面。随着他们变得智慧，他们逐渐接受这真正的纯真。小孩子纯真的品质向我呈现为某种几乎无生命的木质的东西，并随着孩子通过对真理的认知和对良善的情感得以完善而获得生机。此后，真正纯真的品质表现为一个十分美丽、活泼、赤身的小孩。住在最内层天堂、因而离主最近的真正纯真的天使，在其他天使看来就像小孩，甚至是赤身的小孩。因为纯真被表现为他们不觉羞耻的赤身露体，如我们所读到伊甸园中的第一个人及其妻子。总之，天使越智慧，就越纯真，越纯真就越看似小孩。故在圣言中，“婴孩”意指纯真。关于纯真的状态，蒙主怜悯，容后再述。</p>

As regards the innocence of little children, being as yet devoid of intelligence and wisdom it is only a kind of plane for receiving genuine innocence, which they receive by degrees as they become wise. 
The quality of the innocence of little children has been represented to me by a wooden something almost void of life, which is vivified in proportion as they are perfected by means of knowledges of 
truth and affections of good. The quality of genuine innocence was afterwards represented by a most beautiful little child, full of life, and naked; for the innocent themselves, who are in the inmost 
heaven, and thereby are nearest the Lord, appear before the eyes of other angels no otherwise than as little children, and indeed naked; for innocence is represented by the nakedness of which they are 
not ashamed, as we read of the first man and his wife in paradise. In a word, the wiser the angels are, the more innocent they are; and the more innocent they are, the more do they appear to themselves 
as little children. Hence it is that in the Word innocence is signified by "infancy." But concerning the state of innocence, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. </p>

As regards the innocence possessed by young children, because as yet it is devoid of intelligence and wisdom, it is merely a kind of plane for receiving genuine innocence, which they do receive gradually 
as they become wise. The nature of young children's innocence has been represented to me by something wooden and practically devoid of life, but which is made living as they are perfected by means 
of cognitions of truth and affections for good. The nature of genuine innocence was afterwards represented by a very beautiful young child, full of life, and naked. For the truly innocent, who dwell 
in the inmost heaven and so nearest to the Lord, appear before the eyes of other angels as none other than small children, and indeed as naked; for innocence is represented by 'the nakedness of which 
they are not ashamed', as one reads of the first man and his wife in paradise. In short, the wiser angels are the more innocent they are; and the more innocent they are the more they appear to themselves 
as young children. This is why in the Word innocence is meant by early childhood. But the state of innocence will in the Lord's Divine mercy be dealt with further on. </p>

</p><b>2306.</b>
Quod infantum innocentiam attinet, illa quia absque intelligentia et sapientia adhuc, est modo planum quoddam ad recipiendum genuinam innocentiam, quam recipiunt secundum gradus prout sapientes fiunt. 
 Repraesentatum est mihi qualis est innocentia infantum, per ligneum quoddam fere expers vitae, quod vivificatur, sicut per cognitiones veri et affectiones boni perficiuntur: et postea repraesentatum 
qualis est genuina innocentia, per pulcherrimum infantem prorsus vivum, et nudum; ipsi enim innocentes qui sunt in intimo caelo, et sic proximi Domino, coram oculis aliorum angelorum non apparent aliter 
ac infantes, et quidem nudi, nam innocentia repraesentatur per `nuditatem quam non pudent,' ut legitur de primo homine et ejus uxore in paradiso.  Verbo, quo sapientiores angeli, eo innocentiores, 
et quo innocentiores, eo plus apparent sibi sicut infantes; inde est quod innocentia Verbo significetur per infantiam: sed de innocentiae statu, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus. </p>
