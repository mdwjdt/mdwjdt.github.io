<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2897节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2897.</strong>大洪水后古教会的圣言就源于这些名为“以诺”的人。该教会成员因是属灵的，而非属天的，故知道却没有觉察到这些代表物和有意义的符号包含什么。由于这些包含神性事物，故它们逐渐在这些人当中得以应用，被用于其神性敬拜中，好叫他们可以与天堂沟通。因为如前所述，世上的一切事物都代表并表示诸如天上的那类事物。他们还有一本书面圣言，它由历史和预言构成，类似旧约。但随着时间推移，这本圣言遗失了。这些历史被称为“耶和华的战争”，而预言则被称为“作诗歌的”（Utterances或Enunciations），这一事实明显可见于摩西书（参看民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.14.htm">21:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.27.htm">27</a>），那里引用了它们。他们的历史是以预言的风格写成的，并且绝大部分是虚构的历史，如创世记头11章的历史。这从摩西书中对这些历史事件的引用清楚看出来，那里有这些话：<br />所以耶和华的战记上说，苏法的哇哈伯与亚嫩河的河谷，并河谷的斜坡，就是伸展到亚珥居住之地，靠近摩押边界的。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.14.htm">21:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.15.htm">15</a>）<br />他们的预言类似旧约的预言，这同样从摩西中对它们的引用清楚看出来，那里有这些话：<br />所以那些作诗歌的说，你们来到希实本，愿西宏的城被修造，被建立。因为有火从希实本发出，有火焰出于西宏的城，烧尽摩押的亚珥和亚嫩河丘坛的主。摩押啊，你有祸了！基抹的民哪，你们灭亡了！他使自己的男子逃奔，女子被掳，交付亚摩利的王西宏。我们射了他们，希实本直到底本尽皆毁灭。我们荒废，直到挪法，这挪法直延到米底巴。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.27.htm">21:27</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.30.htm">30</a>）<br />这些预言和旧约的预言一样，包含天上的奥秘。这不仅从摩西将它们抄录下来，并运用到那时他所写那些事的状态中的事实很明显看出来，还从几乎同样的话出现在耶利米书的事实明显看出来。它们就包括在他的预言中，这从有关圣言内义的说明清楚可知。它们里面的天上奥秘和构成它们的话一样多，在耶利米书中的这些话是：<br />有火从希实本发出，有火焰出于西宏，烧尽摩押的角和哄嚷人的头顶。摩押啊，你有祸了！基抹的人民灭亡了！因你的众子都被掳去，你的众女也被掳去。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶48.45.htm">48:45</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶48.46.htm">46</a>）<br />由此还明显可知，那圣言也有内义。关于洪水后的古教会，可参看前文（<a href="640.htm">640</a>，<a href="641.htm">641</a>，<a href="765.htm">765</a>，<a href="1238.htm">1238</a>，<a href="1327.htm">1327</a>，<a href="2385.htm">2385</a>节）。</p>

From this source was the Word in the Ancient Church which was after the flood. As the man of this church was spiritual and not celestial, he knew but did not perceive what the representatives and significatives 
involved; and as they involved Divine things, they came to be in use among those men, and were employed in their Divine worship; and this in order that they might have communication with heaven; 
for as before said, all things in the world represent and signify such things as are in heaven. They also had a written Word, which consisted of Histories and Prophecies, like the Word of the Old 
Testament; but in process of time that Word was lost. The Histories were called "Wars of Jehovah," and the Prophecies were called "Enunciations," as is evident in Moses (see Num. 21:14, 27), where 
they are quoted. Their histories were written in the prophetic style, and were for the most part made up histories, like those in the first eleven chapters of Genesis; as is plain from the quotations 
from them in Moses, where are these words: </p>
<p>     Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of Jehovah, Vaheb in Suphah, and the rivers of Arnon, and the slope of the rivers that inclineth toward the 
dwelling of Ar, and leaneth upon the border of Moab (Num. 21:14-15). [2] Their prophecies were written like the prophecies of the Old Testament, as is likewise plain from the quotations made from them 
also in Moses, where are these words: </p>
<p>     Wherefore the Enunciations (or the Prophetic Enunciators) say, Come ye to Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and established; for a fire is gone out 
of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon; it hath devoured Ar of Moab, the lords of the high places of Arnon. Woe to thee, Moab; thou hast perished, O people of Chemosh; he hath given his sons as 
escapers, and his daughters into captivity, unto Sihon king of the Amorite. And we have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto 
Medeba (Num. 21:27-30). That these prophecies involve heavenly arcana, as do the prophecies of the Old Testament, is clearly manifest not only from their having been transcribed by Moses and applied 
to the state of things of which he was then writing, but also from the fact that nearly the same words are found in Jeremiah, inserted in the prophecies of that book; in which it is evident, from what 
has been said about the internal sense of the Word, that there are as many heavenly arcana as there are words. The words in Jeremiah are: </p>
<p>     A fire is gone forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from among 
Sihon, and hath devoured the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the sons of tumult. Woe unto thee, O Moab, the people of Chemosh has perished, for thy sons are taken into captivity, and 
thy daughters into captivity (Jer. 48:45-46). From this also it is plain that that Word also had an internal sense. (Concerning the Ancient Church which was after the flood, see above, n. 640, 641, 
765, 1238, 1327, 2385.) </p>

The Word in the Ancient Church after the Flood however was derived from these people meant by 'Enoch'. The member of this Church, being spiritual and not celestial, knew but did not see with perception 
what was embodied in representatives and meaningful signs. And because these embodied Divine things they held out a use to members of that Church and were employed by them in their Divine worship, 
to the end that they might have a communication with heaven; for, as has been stated, all things in the world represent and mean such things as exist in heaven. Also the Word which they had was a written 
Word, consisting of Historical Sections and Prophetical Parts, like the Old Testament Word. But in course of time that Word came to be lost. The historical sections were called The Wars of Jehovah, 
and the prophetical parts The Utterances, as is clear in Moses, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2021:14,%2027&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 21:14, 27</a>, where they are quoted. The historical sections of their Word were written in the prophetical style and were for the most 
part made-up historical narratives, like those in Chapters <a href="1.htm">1</a>-<a href="11.htm">11</a> of Genesis, as is evident from the quotations of those historical narratives in Moses, where the following words occur, </p>
<blockquote>
Therefore 
it is said in The Book of The Wars of Jehovah, Waheb in Suphah, and the streams of Arnon, and the descent of the streams which runs down to the dwelling at Ar and leans to the border of Moab. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2021:14,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 21:14, 15</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>The prophetical parts of their Word were written in a style similar to the prophetical parts of the Old Testament, as is also evident from the quotation of these in Moses, where the following 
words occur, </p>
<blockquote>
Therefore The Utterances (or The Utterers of Prophecies) say, Come to Heshbon the city of Sihon shall be built and established. For fire went out of Heshbon flame out of the city of 
Sihon. It consumed Ar of Moab, the lords of the high places of Arnon. Woe to you, O Moab! You have perished, O people of Chemosh! He gave his sons as fugitives, and his daughters into captivity, to 
Sihon, king of the Amorites. But we shot at them; Heshbon has perished even to Dibon; and we have laid waste even to Nophah, which reaches even to Medebah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2021:27-30&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 21:27-30</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>These prophetical utterances 
embody heavenly arcana in the same way as the prophetical parts of the Old Testament. This is quite evident not only from the fact that Moses copied them and applied them to the state of affairs prevailing 
in his own day, but also from the fact that almost the same words occur in Jeremiah. Included there among his prophetical sayings, they hold - as becomes clear from what has been stated about 
the internal sense of the Word - as many heavenly arcana within them as they consist of words. Those sayings as they occur in Jeremiah are as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
A fire has gone out of Heshbon, and a flame from 
between Sihon, and has devoured the corner of Moab and the crown of the head of the sons of tumult. Woe to you, O Moab! The people of Chemosh have perished, for your sons have been taken away into 
captivity, and your daughters into captivity. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2048:45,%2046&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 48:45, 46</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From this also it is evident that that Word too possessed an internal sense. Regarding the Ancient Church after the Flood, see <a href="640.htm">640</a>, <a href="641.htm">641</a>, 
<a href="765.htm">765</a>, <a href="1238.htm">1238</a>, <a href="1327.htm">1327</a>, <a href="2385.htm">2385</a>. </p>

Verbum autem in Ecclesia Antiqua quae post diluvium, fuit inde; homo hujus Ecclesiae quia fuit spiritualis, non autem caelestis, repraesentativa et significativa quid involverent, sciebat sed non percipiebat, 
{1}et quia involvebant Divina, illis in usum cesserunt et in cultu eorum Divino adhibita; et hoc ex causa ut communicationem haberent cum caelo; nam, sicut dictum, omnia quae in mundo sunt, 
repraesentant et significant talia quae in caelo.  Etiam Verbum habuerunt scriptum, quod constabat ex Historicis et Propheticis, sicut Verbum Veteris Testamenti, sed illud Verbum successu temporis deperditum 
est; Historica vocata sunt Bella Jehovae, et Prophetica vocata sunt Enuntiata, ut constat apud Mosen, Num. xxi 14, 27, ubi citantur.  Historica illorum scripta fuerant stilo prophetico, et quoad 
plurimam partem fuerunt historica facta, sicut illa quae in Gen. a i ad xi; ut patet ab illis quae inde sunt apud Mosen, ubi haec,           Propterea dicitur in Libro Bellorum Jehovae, {2}Vahebam  
    in Supha, et fluvios Arnonis, et decursum fluviorum qui      declinavit ad habitari Ar, et innititur termino Moabi, Num.      xxi 14, 15. Prophetica illorum fuerunt scripta sicut Prophetica 
Veteris Testamenti, ut quoque patet ab illis quae etiam inde apud Mosen, ubi haec,           Propterea dicunt Enuntiata: (seu Enuntiatores      Prophetici,) Venite Heshbonem, aedificabitur, et firmabitur  
    urbs Sihonis quia ignis exivit e Heshbone, flamma ex urbe      Sihonis, comedit Ar Moabi, dominos excelsorum Arnonis.  Vae      tibi Moabe, periisti popule Kemosh, dedit filios suos   
   evasores, et filias suas in captivitatem regi Emoraei Sihoni; </p>
<p>     et telis petiimus illos, periit Heshbon usque ad Dibonem, et      vastavimus usque ad Nophah:  quae usque ad Medebam, Num. xxi  
    27-30. Quod haec prophetica involvant arcana caelestia sicut prophetica Veteris Testamenti, manifeste patet, non solum ex eo quod exscripta sint a Mose, et applicata ad rerum statum, de quo tunc; 
sed etiam quod eadem paene verba legantur apud {3}Jeremiam, et propheticis apud illum inserta, in quibus quod totidem arcana caelestia sint quot verba, ex illis quae de interno sensu Verbi {4}dicta 
sunt, constare potest illa ita apud {5}Jeremiam,           Ignis exivit e Heshbone, et flamma exinter Sihonem, et      comedit angulum Moabi, et verticem filiorum sonitus:  vae tibi      Moab, periit 
populus Kemosh, quia sumpti filii tui in      captivitatem et filiae tuae in captivitatem, xlviii 45, 46; </p>
<p>inde etiam patet quod illud Verbum {6}etiam sensum internum habuerit De Ecclesia Antiqua
