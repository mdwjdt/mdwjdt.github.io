<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3446节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3446.</strong>创世记26:26，27.亚比米勒和他的同伴亚户撒、他的军长非各，从基拉耳来见以撒。以撒对他们说，你们既然恨我，赶我离开你们，为什么到我这里来呢？<br />“亚比米勒从基拉耳来见以撒”表关注理性事物的信之教义。“他的同伴亚户撒、他的军长非各”表其信之教义的首要特征。“以撒对他们说，你们既然恨我，赶我离开你们，为什么到我这里来呢”表既然他们否认神性，厌恶圣言内义所包含的事物，又为何渴望神性呢？</p>

Verses 26, 27. And Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his companion, and Phicol the captain of his army. And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore are ye come unto me, and ye have hated me, and 
have sent me away from you? "And Abimelech went to him from Gerar," signifies the doctrine of faith that looks to rational things; "and Ahuzzath his companion, and Phicol the captain of his army," signifies 
the primaries of the doctrine of their faith; "and Isaac said unto them, Wherefore are ye come unto me, and ye have hated me, and have sent me away from you?" signifies why should they desire 
the Divine, seeing that they denied it, and were opposed to that which is in the internal sense of the Word. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3446</b></p><p><b>3446.</b>
Verses 26, 27 And Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his companion, and Phicol the commander of his army. And Isaac said to them, For what reason have you come to me, seeing that you hate 
me and have sent me away from you? </p>
<p>'And Abimelech went to him from Gerar' means the doctrine of faith which has regard to rational concepts. 'And Ahuzzath his companion, and Phicol the commander of 
his army' means the first and foremost features of their doctrine of faith. 'And Isaac said to them, For what reason have you come to me, seeing that you hate me and have sent me away from you?' means, 
Why should they desire what is Divine seeing that they refused to recognize it and loathed that which is contained in the internal sense of the Word? </p>

Vers. 26, 27.  Et Abimelech ivit ad illum e Gerar, et Ahuzzath socius illius, et Phicol dux exercitus illius. Et dixit ad illos Jishak, Quapropter venistis ad me, et vos odistis me, et misistis me a 
vobis? `Et Abimelech ivit ad illum e Gerar' significat doctrinam fidei spectantem rationalia: `et Ahuzzath socius illius, et Phicol dux exercitus illius' significat primaria doctrinae illorum fidei: 
`et dixit ad illos Jishak, Quapropter venistis ad me, et vos odistis me, et misistis me a vobis?' significat cur Divinum vellent cum illud negarent, et illud adversarentur quod in sensu interno Verbi? </p>
