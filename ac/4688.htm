<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4688节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4688.</strong>“看哪，你们的捆来围着”表那些处于信仰的人，也就是说那些处于某种仁爱信仰的人。这从“来围着”和“捆”的含义清楚可知：“来围着”在此是指一种靠近，以便敬拜，因为接下来经上说：“向我的捆下拜”，以此表示敬拜；“捆”是指教义，如刚才所述（<a href="4686.htm">4686</a>节），在此是指教义的一切事物，或信的一切事物。“捆”在此之所以具有这样的含义，是因为就纯正意义而言，信的一切事物由雅各的所有儿子（<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="3926.htm">3926</a>节），因而也由“捆”来代表；还因为在梦里，这些捆取代了雅各的儿子；又因为田中间所看到的场景和田中间表示更内在之物，或教会中那些更内在的人，如前所述（<a href="4686.htm">4686</a>节），因而表示那些处于某种仁爱信仰的人。因此，这些人就是“来围着并向约瑟的捆下拜的捆”所表示的人。所指的不是那些更外在，也就是离中间更远，在此由“约瑟的哥哥们”严格意义上所表示的人；这一事实从前后文所述，即他们“越发恨他”，也就是蔑视和憎恶他明显看出来。因为论及他哥哥们的“恨恶”、“不说和睦的话”和“嫉妒”表示蔑视和憎恶。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4688</b></p><p><b>4688.</b>
And behold your sheaves came round about. That this signifies those who were in faith, namely, in the faith of some charity, is evident from the signification of "coming round about," as here being an 
approaching to adore, for it follows that "they bowed down themselves to his sheaf," by which is signified adoration; and from the signification of a "sheaf," as being doctrine (of which just above, 
n. 4686), here all things of doctrine, or all things of faith. That "sheaves" here have such a signification is because in the genuine sense all things of faith are represented by all the sons of Jacob 
(n. 3858, 3926), thus also by the sheaves, because these in the dream took the place of the sons of Jacob; and also because the scene lay in the midst of the field, and by the midst of the field is 
signified what is interior, or those who are interior in the church (of which above, n. 4686), thus those who are in the faith of some charity. These therefore are the "sheaves which came round about, 
and bowed down themselves to the sheaf of Joseph." That those are not meant who are exterior or more remote from the midst, and who in the proper sense are here the "brethren" of Joseph, is plain from 
what precedes and what follows-that they hated him more and more, that is, despised him and felt aversion; for "hating," "not speaking for peace," and "envying," which are said of his brethren, signify 
contempt and aversion. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4688</b></p><p><b>4688.</b>
'And behold, your sheaves gathered round it' means those who were governed by faith, that is to say, by faith grounded in some charity. This is clear from the meaning of 'gathering round' here as an 
approach in order to worship, for the statement follows that 'they bowed down to his sheaf', by which worship is meant; and from the meaning of 'a sheaf' as doctrine, dealt with just above in <a href="4686.htm">4686</a>, in 
this case every aspect of doctrine, that is, every aspect of faith. The reason 'sheaves' has this meaning here is that all the sons of Jacob represent in the genuine sense every aspect of faith, <a href="3858.htm">3858</a>, <a href="3926.htm">3926</a>, and so also do 'sheaves' because in the dream these stood in place of the sons of Jacob. 'Sheaves' also has that meaning because what was seen took place in the middle of the field, and 'the middle 
of the field' means that which is more internal, or those within the Church who are more internal ones, dealt with in <a href="4686.htm">4686</a>, and so means those governed by faith grounded in charity. These are the 
ones who are meant by the sheaves which gathered round and bowed down to Joseph's sheaf. The fact that those who were more external, that is, more remote from the middle, and whom 'Joseph's brothers' 
stand for here in the proper sense, are not meant is evident from what is stated before and after, namely that they hated him all the more, that is, they held him in contempt and turned away in aversion. 
For 'hating,' 'not speaking peaceably', and 'being envious' - expressions used in reference to his brothers - mean contempt and aversion. </p>

</p><b>4688.</b>
`Et ecce circumdederunt manipuli vestri': quod significet illos qui in fide essent, nempe in fide alicujus charitatis, constat (c)a significatione `circumdare' quod hic sit accessus ad adorandum, 
sequitur enim `quod (t)incurvaverint se manipulo ejus' per quod significatur adoratio; et ex significatione `manipuli' quod sit doctrina de qua mox supra n. 4686, hic omnia doctrinae seu omnia fidei 
quod `manipuli' hic significent illa, est quia per `omnes filio Jacobi' repraesentantur in genuino sensu omnia fidei, n. 3858, 3926; ita quoque `manipuli' quia illi erant loco illorum in somnio; 
et quia hoc visum est in medio agri, et per `medium agri' significatur interius seu qui interiores sunt in Ecclesia, de qua agitur n. (x)4686, ita illi qui in fide alicujus charitatis sunt, hi sunt 
`manipuli qui circumdederunt et se incurvarunt manipulo Josephi'; quod illi qui exteriores sunt seu remotiores a medio, {1} et in proprio seu hic sunt `fratres Josephi', (o)non intelligantur, patet 
ab illis quae praecedunt et quae sequuntur quod nempe `oderint eum magis et magis' hoc est, quod contempserint eum et se averterint, nam per `odi, non loqui ad pacem, et invidere', quae dicuntur 
de fratribus ejus, significatur contemptus et aversio.      @1 i hoc est, qui in fide separata non intelligantur, cf. n. 4689 l. 7.$ </p>
