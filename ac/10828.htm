<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10828</strong>.主降世是为了拯救人类，否则人类必在永死中灭亡。祂是这样拯救的：祂征服骚扰来到世界和离开世界的每个人；同时荣耀祂的人身；因为通过实现这一切，祂能使地狱永远臣服。地狱的臣服和同时祂人身的荣耀通过祂的人身被允许所经历的试探和在这些试探中不断的胜利而实现；祂在十字架上的受难是最后的试探，也是彻底的胜利。主在下列经文中亲自教导，祂征服了地狱，约翰福音：<br />耶稣说，现在我灵魂愁烦。父啊，救我脱离这时刻，但我原是为这时刻来的。父啊，愿你荣耀你的名。当时就有声音从天上来说，我已经荣耀了我的名，还要再荣耀。然后耶稣说，现在这世界受审判，这世界的首领要被赶出去。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.27.htm">12:27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.28.htm">28</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.31.htm">31</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />你们可以放心，我已经胜了世界。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.33.htm">16:33</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />这从以东来，能力广大、大步行走，以大能施行拯救的是谁呢？我自己的膀臂给我带来拯救。这样，祂就作了他们的救主。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.1.htm">63:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.8.htm">8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.16.htm">59:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.21.htm">21</a>）<br />祂还在这些经文教导，祂祂荣耀了祂的人身，十字架是最后的试探和彻底的胜利，祂通过这试探而得了荣耀；约翰福音：<br />犹大既出去，耶稣就说，神要在自己身上荣耀祂，并且立刻荣耀祂。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.31.htm">13:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.32.htm">32</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />耶稣说，父啊，时刻到了。愿你荣耀你的儿子，使儿子也荣耀你。父啊，现在求你用未有世界以先，我和你同在时所有的荣耀来荣耀我。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.1.htm">17:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.5.htm">5</a>）<br /><br />现在我灵魂愁烦。父啊，愿你荣耀你的名。当时就有声音从天上来说，我已经荣耀了我的名，还要再荣耀。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.27.htm">12:27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.28.htm">28</a>）<br />路加福音：<br />基督这样受害，又进入祂的荣耀，岂不是应当的吗？（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.26.htm">24:26</a>）<br />“荣耀”表示变成神性。由此明显可知，除非主降世，成为一个人，并以这种方式将所有信祂爱祂的人从地狱解救出来，否则没有人能得救。这就是这句话的意思，即：没有主，就没有救恩。</p>

The Lord came into the world in order to save the human race, which otherwise would have perished in eternal death; and He saved it by this: that He subjugated the hells which were infesting every man 
that came into the world and that went out of the world; and at the same time by this: that He glorified His Human, for in this way He can hold the hells in subjection to eternity. The subjugation of 
the hells and the simultaneous glorification of His Human, were effected by means of temptations admitted into His Human, and by continual victories then. His passion on the cross was the last temptation 
and the full victory. That the Lord subjugated the hells, He Himself teaches in the following passages: </p>
<p>     Jesus said, Now is My soul troubled, Father, rescue Me from this hour; but for this 
cause came I into the world. Father, glorify Thy name. There came forth a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and I will glorify it again. Then Jesus said, Now is the judgment of this 
world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out (John 12:27, 28, 31).      Be of good cheer; I have overcome the world (John 16:33).      Who is this that cometh from Edom, marching in the multitude 
of his strength, great to save? Mine own arm performed salvation for Me; therefore He became their Savior (Isa. 63:1, 5, 8; also 59:16-21). That He glorified His Human, and that the passion of 
the cross was the last temptation and the full victory through which He was glorified, He also teaches in these passages: </p>
<p>     After Judas was gone out, Jesus said, Now hath the Son of man been glorified, 
and God shall glorify Him in Himself, and shall straightway glorify Him (John 13:31-32).      Father, the hour is come; glorify Thy Son, that Thy Son also may glorify Thee. Now, O Father, glorify 
Thou Me with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was (John 17:1, 5).      Now is My soul troubled, Father, glorify Thy name; and there came forth a voice from heaven saying, I have 
both glorified it, and I will glorify it again (John 12:27, 28).      Ought not the Christ to suffer this, and to enter into His glory? (Luke 24:26). "To glorify" denotes to make Divine. From this it 
is now evident that unless the Lord had come into the world, and had become a Man, and had in this manner freed from hell all those who believe in Him and love Him, no mortal could have been saved. 
This is meant by its being said that without the Lord there is no salvation. </p>

The Lord came into the world to save the human race, which if He had not done so would have perished in eternal death. He saved it by subduing the hells which were molesting every person coming into 
the world and going out of it, and at the same time by glorifying His Human; for having accomplished this He is able to keep the hells in subjection for evermore. The subjection of the hells and the glorification 
of His Human simultaneously was accomplished by means of temptations which His Human was allowed to undergo and by repeated victories in them, His passion on the Cross being the final temptation 
and the complete victory. The truth that the Lord subdued the hells is His own teaching in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said, Now My soul is troubled. Father, rescue Me from this hour. But on account of this 
I came to this hour. Father, glorify Your name. A voice came from heaven, [saying,] I have both glorified it and will glorify it again. Then Jesus said, Now is the judgement of this world, now will 
the prince of this world be cast outdoors. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2012:27,28,31&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 12:27,28,31</a>.

<p>In the same gospel,  </p>
<blockquote>

<p>And in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Who is this who comes from Edom, 
marching in the vast numbers of His strength, mighty to save? My own arm brought salvation to Me. Therefore He became their Saviour. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2063:1-19;%2059:16-21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 63:1-19; 59:16-21</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>The truth that He glorified His Human, 
and the truth that the passion on the Cross was the final temptation and the complete victory, through which He was glorified, is again His own teaching in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
After Judas went out Jesus said, 
Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God will glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him at once. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2013:31,32&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 13:31,32</a>.

<p>In the same gospel,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said, Father, the hour has come. Glorify Your Son, 
that Your Son also may glorify You. Now, Father, glorify Me with the glory which I had with You before the world was. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2017:1,5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 17:1,5</a>.

Now My soul is troubled. Father, glorify 
Your name. And a voice came from heaven, [saying,] I have both glorified it and will glorify it again. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2012:27,28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 12:27,28</a>.

<p>And in Luke,  </p>
<blockquote>
Ought not the Christ to have suffered this and to enter into 
His glory? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2024:26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 24:26</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Glorifying' means making Divine. From all this it is now clear that unless the Lord had come into the world and been made Man, and by this means had delivered from hell all 
those who believe in Him and love Him, no mortal being could have been saved. This is what should be understood by the statement that without the Lord there is no salvation.  </p>

Dominus in mundum venit ut salvaret genus humanum, quod alioquin periisset morte aeterna; et per id salvavit, quod subjugaverit inferna, quae infestabant omnem hominem venientem in mundum et exeuntem 
e mundo; et simul per id quod glorificaverit Humanum Suum, sic enim inferna potest tenere subjugata in aeternum.  Subjugatio infernorum,et simul glorificatio Humani Ipsius, facta est per tentationes 
in Humanum Suum admissas, et per continuas tunc victorias; passio Ipsius in cruce fuit ultima tentatio et plena victoria.  Quod Dominus subjugaverit inferna, docet Ipse apud Johannem, 	Jesus dixit, 
Nunc anima Mea turbata est; Pater, eripe Me ex  hac hora, sed propter hoc veni in {1}horam hanc; Pater, glorifica nomen Tuum; exiit vox e caelo, Et glorificavi et rursus glorificabo; tunc dixit Jesus, 
Nunc judicium est mundi hujus, nunc princeps mundi hujus ejicietur foras, xii 27, 28, 31: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Confidite, Ego vici mundum, xvi 33: </p>
<p>et apud Esaiam, 	Quis hic venit ex Edom, incedens in multitudine 
roboris sui, manus ad salvandum? salutem praestitit Mihi bracchium Meum; ideo factus est illis in Salvatorem, lxiii 1-(x)19, lix 16-21. Quod glorificaverit Humanum Suum, et quod passio crucis 
fuerit ultima tentatio et plena victoria, per quam glorificatus est, docet etiam apud Johannem, 	Postquam Judas exivit, dixit Jesus, Nunc glorificatus est Filius hominis, et Deus glorificabit Ipsum 
in Se Ipso, et statim glorificabit Ipsum,xiii 31, 32: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Dixit Jesus, Pater, venit hora; glorifica Filium Tuum, ut etiam Filius Tuus glorificet Te; nunc glorifica Me Tu, Pater, gloria quam 
habui antequam mundus erat apud Te, xvii 1, 5: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Nunc anima Mea turbata est; Pater, glorifica Tuum nomen; et exiit vox e caelo, Et glorificavi et rursus glorificabo, xii 27, 28: </p>
<p>et 
apud Lucam, 	Nonne hoc oportebat pati Christum et ingredi in gloriam Suam? xxiv (x)26; </p>
<p>`glorificare' est Divinum facere.  {2}Inde nunc constat quod nisi Dominus in mundum venerit et homo factus sit, 
(c)et eo modo liberaverit ab inferno omnes illos qui credunt in Ipsum ac amant Ipsum, nullus mortalium salvari potuerit; ita intelligitur quod absque Domino nulla salus. @1 mundum AIT$ @2 In A n. 10,829
