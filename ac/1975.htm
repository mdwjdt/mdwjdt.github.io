<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1975节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1975.</strong>关于梦。众所周知，主不仅通过异象，还通过梦揭示天堂的奥秘。梦和异象一样具有代表性和属灵含义，几乎全都属同一类。除了先知外，将要来的事还通过梦透露给其他人。例如通过约瑟的梦，通过与约瑟一同坐监之人的梦，通过法老、尼布甲尼撒，以及其他人的梦。由此可见，这类梦和异象一样，都是从天堂流入的。区别在于，梦是在肉体沉睡时发生的，而异象则是在肉体醒着时发生的。先知的梦，以及诸如圣言中所描述的那些梦如何流入，事实上如何从天堂降下，这已形像化地向我显明。对此，我会通过经历予以详述。</p>

As regards dreams, it is known that the Lord revealed the arcana of heaven to the prophets, not only by visions, but also by dreams, and that the dreams were as fully representative and significative 
as the visions, being almost of the same class; and that to others also as well as the prophets things to come were disclosed by dreams; as by the dreams of Joseph, and of those who were in prison with 
him, and by those of Pharaoh, of Nebuchadnezzar, and others, from which it may be seen that dreams of this kind, equally with visions, flow in from heaven; with this difference, that dreams occur when 
the corporeal is asleep, and visions when it is not asleep. How prophetic dreams, and such as are found in the Word, flow in, nay, descend from heaven, has been shown me to the life; concerning which 
I may relate the following particulars, from experience. </p>

As for dreams, it is well known that the Lord revealed the arcana of heaven to the prophets not only by means of visions but also by means of dreams, and that dreams were just as much representative 
and carried a spiritual meaning as visions, being almost all of the same type. It is also well known that things to come were disclosed by means of dreams to others besides the prophets, for example, 
by means of the dreams which Joseph had, by means of the dreams of those who were in prison with Joseph, by means of the dreams which Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar, and others had. From these considerations 
it becomes clear that dreams of that kind, just as much as visions, flow in from heaven, the difference being that dreams take place when the body is asleep but visions when it is not. The manner in 
which prophetical dreams and those such as are described in the Word flow in - indeed come down from heaven - has been shown to me visually. Of dreams let the following be related from experience. </p>

Quod somnia attinet, notum est quod Dominus apud propheta non solum per visiones, sed etiam per somnia, arcana caeli revelaverit, et quod somnia aeque repraesentativa et significativa fuerint ac visiones, 
et quod fuerint fere unius generis; tum quod etiam apud alios, quam apud prophetas ventura per somnia detecta sint; ut per somnia quae habuit Josephus, quaeque illi qui in carcere cum Josepho, 
quae Pharaoh, quae Nebuchadnezzar, et alii; ex quibus constare potest quod somnia illius generis aeque ac visiones, e caelo influant, cum differentia quod somnia [sint] cum dormit corporeum, at {1} visiones 
cum non dormit.  Quomodo somnia prophetica, et talia quae in Verbo, influunt {2}, immo descendunt e caelo, mihi ad vivum ostensum est; de quibus haec ab experientia licet referre. 	@1 et.$ 	@2
