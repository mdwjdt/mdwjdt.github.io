<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1051节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1051.</strong>“诸水就不会再成为洪水，毁灭一切有血肉的了”表人心智的觉知部分不可能再充满使他象上古教会的最后一代那样灭亡的那类信念了。这一点从前面有关洪水，以及那些灭亡的大洪水前之人的频繁阐述和说明清楚可知，也就是说，对他们而言，不仅意愿部分，甚至连觉知部分也灭亡了，结果，他们无法重生，即一个新的、不同的意愿无法在其心智的觉知部分形成。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1051.</strong> No more will there be water as a flood to destroy all flesh means that our intellectual faculty will no longer be able to absorb delusions so terrible that it will be destroyed, as the final descendants of the earliest church were. This can be seen from the many things stated and illustrated already concerning the flood water [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1051/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_705" target=_top>705</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1051/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_790" target=_top>790</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1051/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_794" target=_top>794</a>] and concerning the people predating the Flood who died out [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1051/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_310" target=_top>310-311</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1051/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_591" target=_top>591-595</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1051/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_792" target=_top>792-813</a>]. (To repeat, they utterly destroyed their power of will and made it hellish, and not only their power of will but their power of understanding too, so that they could not be reborn; in other words, a new will could not be formed in their intellectual part.) </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1051</b></p><p><b>1051.</b>
And the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. That this signifies that man's intellectual part should no more be able to put on such a persuasion for its destruction as did the last 
posterity of the Most Ancient Church, is evident from what has been frequently said and shown before in regard to the waters of the flood, and also in regard to those before the flood who perished; 
namely, that with them not only the will part was destroyed and made infernal, but also the intellectual part; so that they could not be regenerated, that is, have a new will formed in their intellectual part. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1051</b></p><p><b>1051.</b>
'The waters will no more be a flood to destroy all flesh' means that it will not be possible any more for the understanding part of his mind to soak up the kind of persuasion that would cause him to 
perish as the final descendants of the Most Ancient Church did. This becomes clear from what has been stated and shown quite often already about the waters of the flood, and also about those people prior 
to the Flood who perished, namely that with them not only had the will part perished and become hellish but also the understanding part, with the result that they could not be regenerated, that is, 
a new and different will could not be formed in the understanding part of their minds.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1051</b>
</p><b>1051.</b>
Quod 'non erit amplius aquae in diluvium ad perdendum omnem carnem' significet quod intellectuale ejus non amplius tale: persuasionem imbuere poterit ut pereat sicut posteritas ultima Ecclesiae Antiquissimae, 
constare potest ab illis quae saepius prius de aquis diluvii dicta et ostensa sunt, tum quae de antediluvianis qui perierunt quod nempe apud eos non solum voluntarium fuerit deperditum et infernale 
factum, sed etiam intellectuale, sic ut non potuerint regenerari hoc est, nova aliqua voluntas in parte eorum intellectuali formari. </p>
