<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8631节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8631.</strong>木星灵对属灵事物的觉知何等清晰，从他们表现他们称之为独一主的主如何将邪恶的情感转化为良善的情感向我显明。他们将心智或理解力表现为一个优美的形式，将适合一种内在情感的外在形式的活动赋予它；接下来又展示了主如何将某种邪恶折向某种良善。他们做这一切的方式无法用语言来描述，并且如此巧妙，以至于天使都为他们鼓掌。当时，来自我们地球的一些学者也在场；他们是那些头脑充斥着专业术语，对形式、实质、物质和非物质，以及类似术语争论不休，却不将它们应用于任何有用的目的或功用的人。这些灵人甚至无法理解这种表现。</p>

In what clear perception the spirits of Jupiter are with respect to spiritual things, was made evident to me from their representation of how the Lord, whom they call their One Only Lord, converts depraved 
affections into good affections. They represented the intellectual mind as a beautiful form, and imparted to it an activity of the form that was suited to the affection; and they next showed how 
the Lord bends what is depraved therein to good, which they did in a way that no words can describe, and so dexterously that they were praised by the angels. There were then present learned ones from 
our earth, who had immersed their intellectual in the terms of memory-knowledges, and had disputed much about form, substance, the material and the immaterial, and the like, without applying such things 
to any use; but they could not comprehend even this representation. </p>

How clearly the spirits from Jupiter perceive spiritual realities has been demonstrated to me by their representation of the way in which the Lord, whom they call their one and only Lord, turns wicked 
affections into good ones. They represented the mind or understanding as a beautiful form and imparted to it the activity of an outward form just right for an inner affection. Then they showed the way 
in which the Lord bends something wicked there into something good. Words cannot describe the way in which they did this; it was done so skillfully that the angels applauded them. Some learned persons 
from our planet were present at the time; they were those who had saturated their minds with technical terms, and had engaged in many arguments about form, substance, the material and the non-material, 
and similar terms, but had not applied them to any useful purpose. These spirits could not begin to comprehend that representation. </p>

Spiritus Joviales in quam clara perceptione de rebus spiritualibus sunt, constare mihi potuit ex repraesentatione illorum quomodo Dominus, Quem unicum suum Dominum vocant, convertit pravas affectiones 
in bonas; repraesentabant mentem intellectualem ut formam pulchram, ac ei indebant activitatem formae convenientem pro affectione; ac ostendebant dein quomodo Dominus flectit pravum ibi in bonum; quod 
fecerunt modo qui vocibus describi {1}nequit, tam dextre ut collaudati sint ab angelis.  Aderant tunc eruditi ex nostra tellure qui intellectuale suum immerserant terminis scientificorum, et multum 
litigaverunt de forma, de substantia, de materiali et non materiali, et de similibus, (c)ac talia ad nullum usum applicuerunt; hi ne quidem repraesentationem illam comprehendere potuerunt. 	@1 non potest$ </p>
