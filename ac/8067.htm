<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8067节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8067.</strong>“在你两眼之间作纪念”表它必始终在他们的理解力中。这从“纪念”和“眼”的含义清楚可知：“纪念”也指不断想起，经上之所以说“纪念”，是因为在圣言中，它论及理解力，而“记号”论及意愿；“眼”是指理解力（参看<a href="2701.htm">2701</a>，<a href="3820.htm">3820</a>，<a href="4403.htm">4403</a>-<a href="4421.htm">4421</a>，<a href="4523.htm">4523</a>-<a href="4534.htm">4534</a>节）。这就是为何“在你两眼之间作纪念”表示它必始终在他们的理解力中，也就是在他们的思维中。必须简要说一说当如何理解它必始终在理解力中，始终在意愿里。那些通过信和仁铭刻在一个人身上，也就是他完全相信并热爱的事物始终在他的思维和意愿中。甚至他正在思考并忙于其它事，以为那时它们并未出现在他心智中的时候，也在思考并意愿它们。因为它们的确在构成其心智品质的事物当中。事实就是这样，这一点从围绕一个灵人或一位天使的属灵气场很明显地看出来；因为当这个灵人或天使靠近时，从该气场立刻就能得知他的信和仁，以及他心里拥有的许多事物，尽管当时他根本没有思想它们。这类事物构成每个人心智的生命，并且总是留在那里。这些事能通过在人里面所观察到的众多细节来说明，如他对各种事物的反思，他的情感，从小在他里面根深蒂固的行为方式等等，它们不断出现并占统治地位，尽管他根本没有有意识地去想它们。对邻之爱，对神之爱，对良善和真理的爱，以及信也是这样。处于这些爱和信的人不断意愿并思考它们；因为这爱和信就在这些人里面，当他们如此行时，或说当它们在里面时，就说它们“处处掌权”（<a href="6159.htm">6159</a>，<a href="6571.htm">6571</a>，<a href="7648.htm">7648</a>节）。</p>

And for a memorial between thine eyes. That this signifies that it must be constantly in the understanding, is evident from the signification of "a memorial," as also being a constant recollection (it 
is said "a memorial," because in the Word this is predicated of the understanding, whereas "a sign" is predicated of the will); and from the signification of "eyes," as being the understanding (see 
n. 2701, 3820, 4403-4421, 4523-4534), consequently by "a memorial between the eyes" is signified that it must be constantly in the understanding, that is, in the thought. How it is to be understood that 
it must be constantly in the understanding and constantly in the will, shall be briefly told. Those things with a man which have been impressed by means of faith and charity, or which the man fully 
believes and loves, are constantly in his thought and will; for he thinks them and wills them, even when he is thinking and busy about other things, and does not suppose them to be present in his mind; 
for they are among the things which constitute the mind's quality. That this is so is clearly evident from the spiritual sphere which encompasses a spirit or an angel; for when he approaches, it is 
at once known from this sphere of what faith and of what charity he is, and many things he has at heart, although at the time he is not thinking about them. Such things constitute the mind's life of 
everyone, and they always keep themselves there. These things could be illustrated by very many things with man; as by the various reflections, by the affections, and by the actions impressed from infancy, 
and the like, which are continually present and guide, even if nothing is manifestly thought about the matter. The case is the same with love to the neighbor, with love to God, with the love of 
good and truth, and with faith; they who are in these, constantly will them and think them; for these are in them, and when they are within they are said to be "universally regnant" (n. 6159, 6571, 7648). </p>

'And as a memorial between your eyes' means that it shall be constantly in their understanding. This is clear from the meaning of 'memorial' too as constant recollection, the word 'memorial' being used 
because it has reference in the Word to the understanding, whereas 'sign' has reference to the will; and from the meaning of 'the eyes' as the understanding, dealt with in <a href="2701.htm">2701</a>, <a href="3820.htm">3820</a>, <a href="4403.htm">4403</a>-<a href="4421.htm">4421</a>, <a href="4523.htm">4523</a>-<a href="4534.htm">4534</a>. 
This is why 'as a memorial between the eyes' means that it shall be constantly in their understanding, that is, their thinking. </p>
<p>Something brief will be said to show how one should understand 
the explanation that it shall be constantly in the understanding and constantly in the will. The things which have imprinted themselves on a person through faith and charity, that is, which he fully 
believes and loves, are constantly in his thought and will. He thinks them and wills them even when he contemplates and deals with other matters, and imagines that those things are not present in his 
mind at that time. For they are indeed there among other things which determine the character of his mind. The truth of this is plainly evident from the spiritual sphere surrounding a spirit or angel; 
for when the spirit or angel approaches, that sphere tells one immediately about his faith and about his charity, and about much more that he has at heart, even though he is not thinking about them 
at the time. Such are the things that constitute the life of every mind and remain constantly there. These considerations could be illustrated by very many details to be observed in a person, such as 
his reflections on different things, his affections, the ways to act that have been ingrained in him since early childhood, and the like, which are continually present and hold sway although he does 
not consciously think about them at all. It is similar with love to the neighbour, love to God, and a love of goodness and truth, and with faith. People with those kinds of love and with faith will and 
think them constantly; for such love and faith reside within these people, and when they do so they are said to be reigning throughout, see <a href="6159.htm">6159</a>, <a href="6571.htm">6571</a>, <a href="7648.htm">7648</a>. </p>

`Et in memoriale inter oculos': quod significet quod perpetuo in intellectu, constat ex significatione `memorialis' quod etiam sit perpetua recordatio; `memoriale' dicitur quia hoc in Verbo praedicatur 
de intellectuali, at `signum' de voluntario; et ex significatione `oculorum' quod {1}sint intellectus, de qua n. 2701, 3820, 4403-4421, 4523-4534; inde per `in memoriale inter oculos' significatur 
quod perpetuo erit in intellectu, hoc est, in cogitatione.  Quomodo intelligendum {2} quod perpetuo erit in {3}intellectu et perpetuo in {4}voluntate, paucis dicetur: quae apud hominem per fidem et charitatem 
impressa sunt, seu quae homo plane credit et amat, haec perpetuo sunt in ejus cogitatione et voluntate, cogitat enim illa et vult illa tametsi in ideis et in negotiis de illis rebus est, et 
autumat quod illa in mente tunc non adsint; ibi enim sunt inter alia quae constituunt quale mentis; quod ita sit, patet manifeste a sphaera spirituali quae circum spiritum seu angelum est, cum enim appropinquat, 
ex sphaera illa cognoscitur ilico qua fide et qua charitate est, ac plura quae ei cordi sunt, tametsi ille de iis tunc nihil cogitat; sunt talia quae vitam mentis cujusvis constituunt, et 
se tenent perpetuo ibi; illustrari haec possent a perpluribus apud hominem, sicut a reflexionibus variis, ab affectionibus, aque actionibus ab infantia impressis, et similibus, quae jugiter adsunt et 
regunt, etiamsi nihil de eo manifeste cogitatur; ita se habet cum amore in proximum, cum amore in Deum, cum amore boni et veri, cum fide; qui in illis {5}sunt, perpetuo {6}volunt illa ac {7}cogitant illa, 
nam insunt, et cum insunt, dicuntur universaliter regnantia, videatur n. 6159, 6571, 7648. 	@1 sit$ 	@2 i sit$ 	@3 voluntate$ 	@4 intellectu$ 	@5 d sunt i est$ 	@6 vult$ 	@7 cogitat$ </p>
