<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6468节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6468.</strong>刚从世界来的灵人在接受天使的教导之前，只以为一切生命本质上存在于人自己里面，没有任何东西是流入他，因为他们尤其对天堂，因而对天堂的流注一无所知。并不良善的灵人不愿接受有关这些事的任何教导，因为他们渴望凭自己活着，希望生命本质上是他们自己的。我经常与他们谈论这个话题，他们说我没有生命，因为他们听见我说，我的生命并非源于我自己，并且我通过不间断的经历知道这一点。但他们不愿留心这一点，也不愿思考它。于是我被引导说，每个人都照着他的内层所取的形式而拥有生命，该形式是他通过意愿、行动、思考和说话获得的。<br />后来，我与善灵谈论来自主的生命流注。我说，这生命流入所有人，这一事实从天堂明显看出来，因为天堂类似于一个人，故被称为大人（关于大人，以及大人与人里面的一切事物的对应关系，我已在众多章节的末尾论述过了）。我说，如果来自主的生命没有总体上流入天堂，具体地流入那里的每个居民，那么这一切是不可能的。<br />生命的这种流注也可从以下事实明显看出来：整个天堂都与主有关，主在那里是每个人注视的焦点。天堂里的人都朝着祂向上看，而地狱里的人都背着祂向下看；因为主向天堂里的人显为在他们之上的一轮太阳。我进一步说，从这一事实也明显可知，一切生命皆来自主，即：人的灵魂能在子宫里以如此神奇的方式形成身体，以彼此适当的联结形成身体复杂多样的部位和器官，并照着天堂的形像形成它的内层。若非一切生命皆来自主，并且天堂是诸如所描述的样子，灵魂绝无可能做到这一节。</p>

Spirits fresh from the world, before they have been instructed by angels, believe no otherwise than that the all of life is in the man himself, and that nothing flows in; because they know nothing in 
particular about heaven, thus neither about influx thence. Neither are spirits who are not good willing to be instructed in these things, for they desire to live from themselves; and they have said that 
I had no life, because they had heard me say that I do not live from myself, and that I know this by continual experience; but to this they were unwilling to attend. It was further given to say, that 
everyone has life in accordance with the form of the interiors which he has acquired by willing and acting, thinking and speaking. [2] I afterward spoke with good spirits about the influx of life 
from the Lord, that it flows into all, and that this is evident from heaven, in that heaven resembles a man, and is therefore called the Grand Man (of which, and of the correspondence therewith of all 
things in man, I have already treated at the end of a number of chapters), and that this could not possibly be unless life from the Lord flowed into heaven in general, and into each one there in particular. [3] 
It was further said that this is evident from the fact that the universal heaven has reference to the Lord, and that the Lord is there the center of all the looks, they who are in heaven 
looking upward to Him, and they who are in hell looking downward from Him. For the Lord appears to those who are in the heavens as a sun above them. It was further said that it is evident that the all 
of life is from the Lord from this fact also, that the soul of man can in the womb so wonderfully form a body, and its manifold members and organs in such a connection, and its interiors according to 
the image of heaven: this could not possibly be done unless all life were from the Lord, and unless heaven were such as has been described. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6468</b></p><p><b>6468.</b>
Before spirits recently arrived from the world are taught by angels they believe nothing other than this, that every trace of life exists essentially in a person himself and that there is nothing flowing 
into him. The reason for such belief is that people know nothing in particular about heaven, nor thus about influx from there. Spirits who are not good have no wish to be taught anything about these 
matters, for they want life to be intrinsically their own. I have often talked to them on this subject, and they have said that I have no life because they have heard me saying that my life did not 
originate with me and that I knew it from unceasing experience. But they had no wish to stop and think about this. Then I have been led to say that the life everyone has depends on the form his interiors 
take, the form he has acquired through willing and acting, thinking and speaking. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 After that I have talked to good spirits about the influx of life from the Lord. I have said that it flows 
into everyone, and that this is evident from heaven, in that heaven resembles a human being and is therefore called the Grand Man, which - together with the correspondence of everything in the human 
being with it - has been the subject at the ends of a number of chapters. I have said that none of this would be possible if life from the Lord did not flow into heaven in general and into each of its 
inhabitants in particular. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That influx of life is also evident from the fact that the whole of heaven relates back to the Lord and that the Lord is the focal point there of everyone's gaze. Those 
in heaven look up, towards Him, whereas those in hell look downwards, away from Him; for the Lord is seen by those in heaven as the Sun, up above them there. I have said in addition that the receipt 
from the Lord of every trace of life is also evident from the ability of the human soul in the womb to form the body in so wondrous a fashion, to form its complex members and organs in such proper 
connection with one another, and its interiors in the image of heaven. The soul could not possibly do this unless all life came from the Lord and unless heaven was such as has been described. </p>

Spiritus recentes e mundo, antequam instructi sunt per angelos, non aliter credunt quam quod omne vitae sit in ipso homine et quod nihil influat; causa est quia nihil in particulari sciunt de caelo, 
{1}ita nec de influxu inde; spiritus non boni {2}nec volunt instrui in his, nam volunt vivere a se; saepius cum illis de ea re locutus sum, et dixerunt quod nullam vitam haberem, quia audiverunt me dicentem 
quod ex me non viverem, et quod id per continuam experientiam scirem, sed ad hoc non {3}voluerunt attendere; porro dicere datum est quod quisque vitam habeat secundum formam interiorum, quam sibi 
{4}acquisiverat per velle et agere, cogitare et loqui. [2] Dein cum bonis spiritibus locutus sum de influxu vitae a Domino, quod haec influat in omnes; et quod hoc pateat a caelo, quod hoc referat 
hominem ac ideo vocatur Maximus Homo, de quo et de {5}correspondentia omnium apud hominem cum illo, ad finem plurium capitum actum est; et quod hoc nequaquam fieri posset nisi vita {6}a Domino influeret 
in caelum in communi et in singulos ibi in particulari; [3]et quoque quod pateat ex eo quod universum caelum se referat ad Dominum, et quod Dominus sit ibi centrum intuitionum omnium, et qui in caelo 
sunt, sursum (x)spectent ad Illum, et qui in inferno deorsum ab Illo; apparet enim Dominus illis qui in caelis, ut Sol, ibi sursum est.  Porro dictum quod pateat omne vitae esse a Domino etiam ex 
eo quod anima hominis in utero tam mirabiliter formare possit corpus, et ejus multiplicia membra et organa in tali serie, ac interiora ejus ad imaginem caeli {7}; hoc nusquam fieri posset nisi omnis vita 
a Domino et nisi caelum tale foret. @1 minus$ @2 non$ @3 volebant$ @4 acquisivit in mundo$ @5 cujus correspondentia cum homine et cum singulis ejus$ @6 Domini$ @7 i et ad receptaculum influxuum inde$ </p>
