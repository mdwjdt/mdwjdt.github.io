<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4310节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4310.</strong>就内在历史意义而言，“雅各便给那地方起名叫毗努伊勒”表他们担任代表所处的状态。这从“起名”、“地方”和“毗努伊勒”的含义清楚可知：“起名”是指性质，如前面频繁所述；“地方”是指状态（<a href="2625.htm">2625</a>，<a href="2837.htm">2837</a>，<a href="3356.htm">3356</a>，<a href="3387.htm">3387</a>节）；“毗努伊勒”是指在这层意义上担任代表，因为这些代表就是上下文所论述的主题。“毗努伊勒”的字义以“因为我面对面见了神，我的灵魂仍得保全”这些话来解释，其灵义是主同在于所代表之物，如接下来所论述的。所以，此处的意思是，他们担任代表。地名和人名，以及实际事物的名一样，在这层意义和那层意义上含义是不一样的。例如，“雅各”本身在字义上表示雅各本人；在内在历史意义上则表示他的后代（<a href="4281.htm">4281</a>节）；在内在属灵意义上表示重生之人里面的属世人；但在至高意义上则表示主的神性属世层，这在前面已反复说明。这种情形也适用于所有其它名字，因而同样适用于毗努伊勒。</p>

That in the internal historical sense by "Jacob called the name of the place Peniel" is signified the state in which they put on the representations, is evident from the signification of "calling a name," 
as being the quality (of which often before); from the signification of "place," as being state (n. 2625, 2837, 3356, 3387); and from the signification of "Peniel" as being in this sense to put 
on representations, for these are the subject treated of in what precedes and what follows. What "Peniel" signifies is explained by the words, "for I have seen God faces to faces, and my soul is delivered," 
by which is signified that the Lord was present representatively (of which in what soon follows), thus here that they put on representations. Names of places, like names of persons, as also the 
things themselves, do not signify the same in one sense as in another. Thus "Jacob" himself in the sense of the letter signifies Jacob himself; in the internal historical sense, his posterity (n. 4281); 
in the internal spiritual sense, the natural man in him who is regenerate; but in the supreme sense, "Jacob" signifies the Lord as to the Divine natural, as has been often shown. It is the same with 
all other names, and thus with Peniel. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4310</b></p><p><b>4310.</b>
In the internal historical sense 'Jacob called the name of the place Peniel' means a state in which they took on representations. This is clear from the meaning of 'calling the name' as the essential 
nature, often dealt with already; from the meaning of 'place' as state, dealt with in <a href="2625.htm">2625</a>, <a href="2837.htm">2837</a>, <a href="3356.htm">3356</a>, <a href="3387.htm">3387</a>; and from the meaning of 'Peniel', in this sense, as taking on representations, for representations 
are the subject in what has gone before and directly follows. The literal meaning of Peniel is explained in the words 'for I have seen God face to face, and my soul is delivered', the spiritual 
meaning of which is the Lord's presence in that which was represented, dealt with immediately below. So the meaning here is that they took on representations. Names of places, as with the names of 
persons, and also of actual things, do not have the same meaning in one sense as they do in another. Jacob himself, for example, in the sense of the letter means Jacob himself; in the internal historical 
sense his descendants, <a href="4281.htm">4281</a>; in the internal spiritual sense the natural man in the case of one who is regenerate; but in the highest sense the Lord's Divine Natural is meant, as has been shown often. 
This applies to all other names, and so no less to Peniel. </p>

Quod in sensu interno historico per `vocavit Jacob nomen loci Peniel' significetur status quod induerent repraesentationes, constat ex significatione `vocare nomen' quod sit quale, de qua saepius 
prius; a significatione `loci' quod sit status, de qua n. 2625, 2837, 3356, 3387; et ex significatione `Peniel' quod in hoc sensu sit induere repraesentationes, nam de his agitur in illis quae praecedunt 
et quae insequuntur {1}: quid Peniel significat, explicatur per haec verba `quia vidi Deum facies ad facies, et liberata anima mea {2} per quae significatur quod Dominus repraesentative praesens, 
de qua re (o)mox sequitur, ita hic quod induerent repraesentationes.  Nomina locorum, sicut nomina personarum, ut et ipsae res, non significant similiter in uno sensu ac in altero; sicut ipse 
Jacob, is in sensu litterae significat ipsum Jacobum; in sensu interno historico posteritatem ejus {3}, n. 4281; in sensu interno (o)spirituali naturalem hominem apud regeneratum; in sensu autem 
supremo Dominum quoad Divinum Naturale, ut saepius ostensum (o)est; ita quoque reliqua nomina; ac ita Peniel.      @1 sequuntur$      @2 i est$      @3 suam$ </p>
