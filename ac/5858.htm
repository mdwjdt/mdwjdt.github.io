<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5858节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5858.</strong>大量经历使我得知，凡灵人通过提取人的记忆所思所言的，他们都以为是自己的，就在自己里面。若被告知他们想的不对，他们就非常愤怒；因为这种感官错觉盛行在他们中间。为叫他们相信他们想的不对，我问他们，他们是从哪里知道如何能以我的母语与我交谈的？毕竟他们活在肉身期间对我的母语一无所知；他们又如何知道我所掌握的其它语言？尽管他们自己并没有学习其中的一门。他们真的以为这些语言是他们自己的吗？此外，我给他们，包括小孩子读希伯来语，他们理解得和我一样清楚，只是不会超过我。我记忆里的所有知识都在他们里面。这使他们相信，当来到一个人那里时，他们就会拥有他所知道的一切，并且他们因相信这一切是他们是自己的而持守一种错误观念。他们也拥有自己的知识，但不允许提取出来，以便他们能通过人的知识而服务于人；这样做的原因有很多，如前所述（<a href="2476.htm">2476</a>，<a href="2477.htm">2477</a>，<a href="2479.htm">2479</a>节）。事实上，如果灵人真的与他们自己的记忆一起流入进来，就会造成很大的混乱（<a href="2478.htm">2478</a>节）。</p>

From much experience it has been given me to know that whatever the spirits think and speak from the memory of a man, they suppose to be their own and in themselves. If they are told that this is not 
the case, they are highly indignant-such is the fallacy of sense that prevails with them. To convince them that such is not the case, they were asked whence they knew how to speak with me in my mother 
tongue, and yet they had known nothing at all of it during their life in the body, and how they knew the other languages in which I am skilled, although from themselves they did not know one; do they 
believe that these languages are theirs? Moreover I read the Hebrew language before them, and they understood it as much as I did-even little children-but no further. All the knowledges also that are 
in my memory are in theirs. By this they were convinced that when they come to a man, they come into possession of all his knowledges, and that they are in falsity in believing them to be their own. 
They have also their own knowledges, but are not permitted to draw them out, to the end that they may serve man through his knowledges-as well as for various other reasons, of which above (n. 2476, 2477, 
2479), and because there would be the greatest confusion if spirits were to flow in from their own memory (n. 2478). </p>

Much experience has taught me that anything spirits think or say by drawing on a person's memory they regard as their own, existing within themselves. If told that their idea is not true they are highly 
indignant; for that kind of sensory illusion holds sway among them. I have asked them - to convince them that their idea is not true - how it is that they can talk to me in my own mother tongue, having 
had absolutely no knowledge at all of it during their lifetime. How do they know the other languages that I have mastered without learning a single one for themselves? Do they really think those 
languages are theirs? I have read even the Hebrew language to them which they, including young children, understood to the same extent as I understood it, but not beyond. They have also been shown that 
all the knowledge present with me is present with them. This has convinced them that when they come to a person they enter into possession of everything he knows, and that in believing it is their 
own they are holding to a false idea. They do have knowledge that is their own, but they are not allowed to draw on it, to the end that they may serve a person through the knowledge he has; and there 
are many other reasons for this as well, dealt with in <a href="2476.htm">2476</a>, <a href="2477.htm">2477</a>, <a href="2479.htm">2479</a>. Indeed very great confusion would result if spirits were to flow in with what came from their own memory, <a href="2478.htm">2478</a>.

Ex multa experientia mihi scire datum est quod quicquid spiritus cogitant et loquuntur ex memoria hominis, putent esse suum et in se; si illis dicatur quod ita non sit, indignantur valde; talis fallacia 
sensus regnat apud illos. Ut convincerentur quod (t)non ita sit, interrogati sunt unde sciunt loqui mecum lingua mea vernacula, et tamen nihil prorsus ejus noverant in vita corporis, et quomodo ceteras 
linguas quas ego calleo, et quod ne unam a se, annon credunt quod {1}illa sint illorum? legi coram illis etiam linguam Hebraeam quam intellexerunt quantum ego, etiam infantes, et praeterea nihil; 
et quoque quod omnia scientifica quae apud me, apud illos sint; inde convicti sunt quod in possessionem omnium scientiarum hominis veniant cum ad hominem, et quod in falso sint quod credant esse sua. 
Sua quoque habent, sed non licet illa depromere ob causam ut serviant homini per illius, et ob plures alias causas, de quibus n. 2476, 2477, 2479; et quod maxima confusio, si spiritus ex sua memoria 
influerent, n. 2478. @1 i etiam$ </p>
