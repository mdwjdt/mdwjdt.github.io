<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8188节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8188.</strong>“我要在法老和他的全军、战车、马兵上得荣耀”表他们即将看见凭主的神性人身的神性良善驱散虚假和推理的成就。这从“在法老和他全军上得荣耀”、他的“军队”、“战车”、“马兵”的含义，以及“法老”的代表清楚可知：“在法老和他全军上得荣耀”是指淹没在那些陷入邪恶所生虚假之人的地狱之中，以及他们被如水那样的虚假吞没，这仅仅因为主的神性人身的同在（参看<a href="8137.htm">8137</a>节）；“法老”是指那些沉浸于邪恶所生的虚假之人；他的“军队”是指虚假；他的“战车”是指支持虚假的教义事物；他的“马兵”是指虚假的推理，如前所述（<a href="8146.htm">8146</a>，<a href="8148.htm">8148</a>节）。</p>

And I will be glorified in Pharaoh, and in all his army, in his chariots, and in his horsemen. That this signifies that they will see the effect of the dissipation of falsity and of reasonings by virtue 
of the Divine good of the Lord's Divine Human, is evident from the signification of "being glorified in Pharaoh and his army," as being the immersion in hell of those who are in falsity from evil, 
and the encompassing of them there by falsities as by waters, by reason of the mere presence of the Divine Human of the Lord (see above, n. 8137); from the representation of Pharaoh, as being those who 
are in falsities from evil; from the signification of "army," as being falsities; from the signification of "his chariots," as being doctrinal things of falsity; and from the signification of "his 
horsemen," as being false reasonings (of which above, n. 8146, 8156). </p>

'And I will be glorified in Pharaoh, and in all his army, and in his chariots, and in his horsemen' means that they are about to see the accomplishment of the dispersing of falsity and reasonings by 
the Divine Good of the Lord's Divine Human. This is clear from the meaning of 'being glorified in Pharaoh and his army' as the submerging into hell of those ruled by falsity arising from evil, and their 
engulfment by falsities as by waters, accomplished simply by the presence of the Lord's Divine Human, dealt with above in <a href="8137.htm">8137</a>; from the representation of 'Pharaoh' as those steeped in falsities arising 
from evil; from the meaning of 'his army' as falsities; from the meaning of 'his chariots' as teachings that uphold falsity, and from the meaning of 'his horsemen' as false reasonings, dealt with 
above in <a href="8146.htm">8146</a>, <a href="8148.htm">8148</a>. </p>

`Et glorificabor in Pharaone, et in omni exercitu illius, et in curribus illius, et in equitibus illius': quod significet quod visuri effectum dissipationis falsi (c)et ratiociniorum ex Divino Bono 
Divini Humani Domini, constat ex significatione `glorificari in Pharaone et exercitu illius' quod sit immersio illorum qui in falso ex malo in infernum, et circumfusio ibi a falsis ut ab aquis, ex sola 
praesentia Divini Humani Domini, de qua supra n. 8137; ex repraesentatione `Pharaonis' quod sint qui in falsis ex malo; ex significatione `exercitus illius' quod sint falsa; ex significatione `curruum 
illius' quod sint doctrinalia falsi, et ex significatione `equitum illius' quod sint ratiocinia falsa, de quibus {1} supra n. 8146, 8148. 	@1 i etiam$ </p>
