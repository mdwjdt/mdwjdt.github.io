<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2798.</strong>“亚伯拉罕取了燔祭的柴”表公义的功德。这从前面的解释和说明（<a href="2784.htm">2784</a>节）清楚可知，故无需要进一步解释。<br />2798a.“放在（他儿子）以撒身上”表它，就是公义的功德与神圣理性相联结。这从“以撒”的代表性和“放在以撒身上”的含义清楚可知：“以撒”是指主的神圣理性，如前面频繁所述；“放在以撒身上”是指联结它。他被称为“他儿子”，是因为主的神性人不仅从耶和华成孕，还从耶和华出生。从主的圣言清楚可知，主从耶和华成孕，故祂被称为“至高者的儿子”，“神的儿子”，“父的独生子”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太2.15.htm">2:15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太3.16.htm">3:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太3.17.htm">17</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.13.htm">16:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.17.htm">17</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.5.htm">17:5</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太27.43.htm">27:43</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太27.54.htm">54</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可1.10.htm">1:10</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/可9.7.htm">9:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可9.9.htm">9</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/可14.61.htm">14:61</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可14.62.htm">62</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.31.htm">1:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.32.htm">32</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.35.htm">35</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路3.21.htm">3:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路3.22.htm">22</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.35.htm">9:35</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.22.htm">10:22</a>；约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">1:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.50.htm">50</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.13.htm">3:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.16.htm">16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.18.htm">18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.20.htm">5:20</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.27.htm">27</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.69.htm">6:69</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约9.34.htm">9:34</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约9.35.htm">35</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约9.38.htm">38</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.35.htm">10:35</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.36.htm">36</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约20.30.htm">20:30</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约20.31.htm">31</a>），此外在很多其它地方，祂称耶和华为祂的“父”。<br />从圣言还能清楚可知，祂和其他人一样，从童女马利亚出生。但祂再次出生，也就是变成神性时，是通过在祂里面的耶和华，就生命的存在而言，耶和华就是祂自己。神性本质与人性本质是彼此相互融合的，以便祂将神性本质与人性本质，并人性本质与神性本质融合起来（参看<a href="1921.htm">1921</a>，<a href="1999.htm">1999</a>，<a href="2004.htm">2004</a>，<a href="2005.htm">2005</a>，<a href="2018.htm">2018</a>，<a href="2025.htm">2025</a>，<a href="2083.htm">2083</a>，<a href="2508.htm">2508</a>，<a href="2523.htm">2523</a>，<a href="2618.htm">2618</a>，<a href="2628.htm">2628</a>，<a href="2632.htm">2632</a>，<a href="2728.htm">2728</a>，<a href="2729.htm">2729</a>节）。由此清楚可知，主凭自己的力量在自己里面将人性变成神性，并由此变成公义。当主经历最内在的试探时，联结神圣理性的，是公义的功德。祂通过神圣理性争战，并且这神圣理性是恶魔所攻击反对的，直到祂也荣耀那神圣理性。这些就是“亚伯拉罕把燔祭的柴放在他儿子以撒身上”在内义上所表示的事，这些也是这些话被阅读时，天使所觉察到的事。</p>

Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son. That this signifies the merit of righteousness, is evident from what was said and shown above (n. 2784), thus without further 
explication. That he "laid it upon Isaac" signifies that the merit of righteousness was adjoined to the Divine rational, is evident from the representation of Isaac, as being the Lord's Divine rational 
(often shown before) and from the signification of "laying upon him," as being to adjoin. He is called his "son," because the Lord's Divine Human was not only conceived, but was also born of Jehovah. 
That the Lord was conceived of Jehovah is most fully known from the Word of the Lord; hence He is called the "Son of the Highest," the "Son of God," and the "Only-begotten of the Father," in many 
places (Matt. 2:15; 3:16-17; 16:13-17; 17:5; 27:43, 54; Mark 1:10; 9:7, 9; 14:61-62; Luke 1:31-32, 35; 3:21-22; 9:35; 10:22; John 1:14, 18, 50; 3:13, 16-18; 5:20-27; 6:69; 9:34-35, 38; 10:35-36; 20:30-31), 
and in many other places He calls Jehovah His "Father."  [2] That He was born of the virgin Mary is known, yet as another man; but when He was born again, or became Divine, it was from Jehovah 
who was in Him, and who was Himself as to the very being of life. The unition of the Divine and the Human Essence was effected mutually and reciprocally, so that He united the Divine Essence to the 
Human and the Human to the Divine (see n. 1921, 1999, 2004, 2005, 2018, 2025, 2083, 2508, 2523, 2618, 2628, 2632, 2728, 2729). Hence it is evident that the Lord made the Human in Himself Divine by His 
own power, and thus became righteousness. The merit of righteousness was what was adjoined to the Divine rational when He underwent inmost temptations, and from it He then fought, and against this the 
evil genii fought, until He glorified this also. These are the things meant in the internal sense by Abraham laying the wood of the burnt-offering upon Isaac his son, and these are what are perceived 
by the angels when the words are read. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2798</b></p><p><b>2798.</b>
That 'Abraham took the pieces of wood for the burnt offering' means the merit of righteousness is clear from what has been stated and shown above in <a href="2784.htm">2784</a>, and so without further explanation. </p>
<p>[<a href="2798.htm">2798</a>a] 
'And laid them on Isaac [his son]' means that it, that is to say, the merit of righteousness, was joined to the Divine Rational. This becomes clear from the representation of 'Isaac' as the Lord's 
Divine Rational, often dealt with already, and from the meaning of 'laying it on him' as allying it. The expression 'his son' is used because the Lord's Divine Human was not only conceived but was also 
born from Jehovah. The Lord's conception from Jehovah is very well known from the Word of the Lord, and therefore He is called 'Son of the Most High', 'Son of God', and 'Only Begotten of the Father'

 It is also well known that He was born of a virgin Mary, yet even so like any other. But when He was born 
again, that is, became Divine, this was from Jehovah who dwelt within Him and who was Himself as to the very Being (Esse) of life. The union of the Divine Essence and the Human Essence was effected mutually 
and reciprocally, so that He united the Divine Essence to the Human Essence, and the Human Essence to the Divine Essence, see <a href="1921.htm">1921</a>, <a href="1999.htm">1999</a>, <a href="2004.htm">2004</a>, <a href="2005.htm">2005</a>, <a href="2018.htm">2018</a>, <a href="2025.htm">2025</a>, <a href="2083.htm">2083</a>, <a href="2508.htm">2508</a>, <a href="2523.htm">2523</a>, <a href="2618.htm">2618</a>, <a href="2628.htm">2628</a>, 
<a href="2632.htm">2632</a>, <a href="2728.htm">2728</a>, <a href="2729.htm">2729</a>. From this it may become clear that the Lord made the Human within Himself Divine from His own power and in so doing became Righteousness. That which was allied to the Divine Rational 
when He underwent inmost temptation was the merit of righteousness; and it was from the Divine Rational that He fought, and it was against it that evil genii fought, until He glorified that Divine Rational 
also. These are the things meant in the internal sense by Abraham's laying the pieces of wood for the burnt offering on Isaac his son, and they are the things which angels perceive when these words 
are being read. </p>

`Accepit Abraham ligna holocausti':  quod significet meritum justitiae, constat ex illis quae supra n. 2784 dicta et ostensa sunt, ita absque ulteriore explicatione.       `Et posuit super Jishako': 
quod significet quod adjunctum Rationali Divino, nempe meritum justitiae, constare potest a repraesentatione `Jishaki' quod sit Rationale Divinum Domini, de qua saepe prius; et ex significatione `ponere 
super illo' quod sit adjungere; `filius suus' dicitur, quia Divinum Humanum Domini non modo conceptum sed etiam natum est a Jehovah: quod Dominus conceptus a Jehovah notissimum est a Verbo Domini, 
inde vocatur Filius Altissimi, Filius Dei, et Unigenitus Patris, Matth. ii 15; iii 16, 17; xvi 13-17; xvii 5; xxvii 43, 54; Marc. i II; ix 7, 9; xiv 61, 62; Luc. i 31, 32, 35; iii 21, 22; ix 35; x 22; 
Joh. i 14, 18, 50 [A.V. 49]; iii 13, 16-18, v 20-27; vi 69; ix 34, 35, 38; x 35, 36; xx 30, 31, praeter plurimis aliis in locis, ubi Jehovam Patrem Suum nominat; quod natus a virgine Maria, etiam 2 
notum est, sed ut homo alius; verum cum iterum natus seu Divinus factus, fuit a Jehovah Qui in Ipso, et Qui Ipse quoad ipsum Esse vitae; unitio Divinae et Humanae Essentiae facta est mutuo et vicissim 
sic ut Divinam Essentiam univerit Humanae, et Humanam Divinae, videatur n. 1921, 1999, 2004, 2005, 2018, 2025, 2083, 2508, 2523, 2618, 2628, 2632, 2728, 2729; inde constare potest quod Dominus ex propria 
potentia in Se Humanum Divinum fecerit, et sic Justitia factus: meritum justitiae fuit quod adjunctum Rationali Divino cum intimas tentationes subiret, ex quo tunc pugnavit, et contra quod pugnarunt 
mali genii, usque dum illud quoque glorificaverit.  Haec sunt quae in sensu interno intelliguntur per quod `Abraham ligna holocausti posuerit super Jishako filio suo,' et haec sunt quae ab angelis 
percipiuntur cum haec verba legantur. </p>
