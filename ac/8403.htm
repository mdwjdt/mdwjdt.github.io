<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8403节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8403.</strong>“以色列人的全会众发怨言”表由于试探的严厉而造成的痛苦和随之而来的报怨。这从“发怨言”的含义清楚可知。“发怨言”是指由试探的苦楚所造成的痛苦，以及报怨（参看<a href="8351.htm">8351</a>节）；“以色列人的全会众”是指那些属于属灵教会的人（参看<a href="8398.htm">8398</a>节）。此处论述的主题是第三次试探，这次试探的发生是由于快乐和良善的缺乏。该试探以一个系列随前一次试探而来，前一次试探的发生是由于真理的缺乏。<br />不了解人的重生之人以为一个人不经试探就能重生；有些人则以为他经历一次试探后就已经重生了。但是，要知道，不经试探，没有人重生，并且是许多试探一个接一个接踵而来。原因在于，重生的进行是为了旧人的生命能够死去，新的天堂生命能够被灌输。由此可见，一场争战完全是不可避免的；因为旧人的生命会对抗，不甘心被掐灭；而新人的生命只能进入旧人的生命已经被掐灭的地方。由此明显可知，两边都有一场争战，而且这争战是激烈的，因为每一方都在为自己的生命而战。<br />凡出于被启示的理性进行思考的人都能由此看出并发觉，没有争战，也就是没有属灵的试探，没有人能重生；而且人不是通过一次试探，而是通过多次试探重生。因为许多种邪恶已经形成他以前生命的快乐，也就是说，已经构成他的旧生命。所有这些邪恶不可能突然之间同时被制伏，因为它们牢牢粘附在这个人身上，自远古时代起就已经深深扎根于他的先祖，因此是在他里面与生俱来的；而且它们自他小时候起便通过他自己实际所行的邪恶而被强化。所有这些邪恶都与要被灌输，并且必须构成新生命的天上良善直接对立。</p>

And all the assemblage of the sons of Israel murmured. That this signifies the suffering and the consequent complaint on account of the grievousness of the temptation, is evident from the signification 
of "to murmur," as being the suffering from the bitterness of the temptation, and the complaint (see n. 8351); "the assemblage of the sons of Israel" denotes those who are of the spiritual church (see 
n. 8398). Here a third temptation is treated of, which is on account of the lack of delight and of good. This temptation follows, in a series, the former one, which was on account of the lack of truth. [2] 
They who have not been instructed about man's regeneration suppose that a man can be regenerated without temptation; and some that he has been regenerated when he has undergone one temptation. 
But be it known that without temptation no one is regenerated, and that many temptations follow on, one after another. The reason is that regeneration takes place to the end that the life of the old 
man may die, and the new heavenly life be insinuated, which shows that there must needs be a fight, for the life of the old man resists, and is not willing to be extinguished, and the life of the new 
man cannot enter except where the life of the old man has been extinguished. Hence it is evident that there is a fight on both sides, and this fight is a fiery one, because it is for life.  [3] He 
who thinks from enlightened reason can see and perceive from this that no man can be regenerated without a fight, that is, without spiritual temptation; and also that he is not regenerated by one temptation, 
but by many. For very many kinds of evil have made the delight of his former life, that is, have made his old life; and it is impossible for all these evils to be suddenly and simultaneously 
mastered, because they cling to the man very firmly, having been rooted in parents from time immemorial, and consequently are innate in him, besides having been confirmed in him from his infancy through 
his own actual evils. All these evils are diametrically opposite to the heavenly good that is to be insinuated, and that is to make the new life. </p>

'And all the assembly of the children of Israel grumbled' means grief and [therefore] complaint on account of the severity of the temptation. This is clear from the meaning of 'grumbling' as grief caused 
by the bitterness of the temptation, and complaint, dealt with in <a href="8351.htm">8351</a>, 'the assembly of the children of Israel' being those who belong to the spiritual Church, as above in <a href="8398.htm">8398</a>. The subject here 
is a third temptation, which arises because there is a lack of delight and good. This temptation follows the previous one in the series, which arose because there was a lack of truth. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 People uninformed 
about human regeneration suppose that a person can be regenerated without temptation, and some that he has been regenerated after he has undergone a single temptation. But let it be known that 
no one can be regenerated without temptation, and that he suffers very many temptations, following one after another. The reason for this is that regeneration takes place to the end that the life of 
the old man may die and a new, heavenly life may be instilled. From this one may recognize that conflict is altogether inevitable; for the life of the old man stands its ground and refuses to be snuffed 
out, and the life of the new man cannot enter except where the life of the old has been snuffed out. From this it is evident that fierce conflict takes place between mutually hostile sides, since 
each is fighting for its life. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Anyone thinking with enlightened reason can see and perceive from all this that a person cannot be regenerated without conflict, that is, without spiritual temptation, 
and also that a person is not regenerated by undergoing a single temptation, only by undergoing very many of them. For there are numerous kinds of evil that have formed the delight of the former 
life, that is, have constituted the old life. All those evils cannot be subdued on one occasion and all together. They cling stubbornly to the person, for they become deeply rooted in his forebears 
going back many centuries and are for that reason innate in him. They have also been made stronger since early childhood by the evils of his own doing. All these evils are diametrically opposed to the 
heavenly good that is to be instilled and that must constitute the new life. </p>

`Et murmurabant omnis coetus filiorum Israelis': quod significet indolentiam et [inde] querimoniam propter tentationis gravitatem, constat ex significatione `murmurare' quod sit indolentia ex tentationis 
acerbitate, et querimonia, de qua n. 8351; `coetus filiorum Israelis' sunt qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, ut supra n. 8398.  Agitur hic de tertia tentatione, quae est propter defectum jucundi et boni, 
quae tentatio succedit priori in serie, quae fuit propter defectum veri. 	2 Qui non instructi sunt de regeneratione hominis autumant quod homo regenerari queat absque tentatione, et quidam quod regeneratus 
sit quando unam tentationem subierat; sed sciendum quod absque tentatione nullus regeneretur, et quod plures tentationes succedant una post alteram; causa est quia regeneratio fit ob {1} finem 
ut vita veteris hominis moriatur, et vita nova quae caelestis insinuetur; inde constare potest quod omnino pugna erit, vita enim veteris hominis resistit, nec vult exstingui, et vita novi hominis 
non potest intrare nisi ubi vita veteris exstincta est; inde patet quod utrinque pugna sit, et ardens, quia pro vita; qui ex rationali illustrato cogitat, inde potest 3 videre et percipere quod regenerari 
nequeat homo absque pugna, hoc est, absque tentatione spirituali; tum quoque quod non regeneretur per unam tentationem sed per plures; sunt enim perplura genera mali quae jucundum vitae prioris, 
hoc est, vitam veterem, fecerunt; omnia illa mala non possunt semel et simul domari, inhaerent enim pertinaciter, nam irradicata sunt {2}parentibus a multis retro saeculis, et inde innata homini, et confirmata 
per (x)actualia mala ex semet ab infantia; haec mala omnia sunt e diametro opposita bono caelesti quod insinuandum, et quod faciet vitam (x)novam {3}. 	@1 i illum$ 	@2 After saeculis$ 	@3
