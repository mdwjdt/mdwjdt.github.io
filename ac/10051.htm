<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10051节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10051</strong>.“放在块子和头的上面”表内层和至内在事物之下的外层事物的有序排列。这从“块子”、“头”、“肠和腿”，以及“放在前者和后者的上面”的含义清楚可知：“块子”是指内层事物（参看<a href="10048.htm">10048</a>节）；“头”是指至内在之物（<a href="5328.htm">5328</a>，<a href="6436.htm">6436</a>，<a href="9656.htm">9656</a>，<a href="9913.htm">9913</a>，<a href="9914.htm">9914</a>节）；要放在它们上面的“肠和腿”是指最外在和更外在的事物，“肠”是指最外在或最低的事物（参看<a href="10030.htm">10030</a>节），“腿”是指更外在的事物或外层事物（参看<a href="10050.htm">10050</a>节）；“放在前者和后者的上面”是指将它们有序排列。它之所以表示在内层事物之下对外层事物的有序排列，而是像字义说的那样是在它们“上面”，是因为坛和坛上的火是最高或最内在的事物。祭坛代表神性良善方面的主之神性人身，火代表神性之爱本身；因此，离坛上的火最近的公绵羊的这些部分和燔祭是更高或更内在的；而它们上面的部分因离坛上的火更远，故是更低或更外在的。因为离最高之物最近的事物被视为更高或更内在，离最高之物较远的事物被视为更低或更外在，这与字义上所说的不同。无论你说更高和更低的事物，还是说更内在和更外在的事物，意思都一样，因为更高之物更内在，更低之物更外在（<a href="2148.htm">2148</a>，<a href="3084.htm">3084</a>，<a href="4599.htm">4599</a>，<a href="5146.htm">5146</a>，<a href="8325.htm">8325</a>节）。由此明显可知，将“肠和腿放在块子和头的上面”表示最外在和更外在的事物必须在内层和至内在事物之下被有序排列。祭坛是神性良善方面的主之神性人身的代表（参看<a href="921.htm">921</a>，<a href="2777.htm">2777</a>，<a href="2811.htm">2811</a>，<a href="9388.htm">9388</a>，<a href="9389.htm">9389</a>，<a href="9714.htm">9714</a>，<a href="9964.htm">9964</a>节）；坛上的火是指祂的神性之爱（参看<a href="6832.htm">6832</a>节）。</p>

And put them upon its pieces and upon its head. That this signifies the setting in order of exterior things under interior and inmost ones, is evident from the signification of the "pieces," as being 
interior things (see above, n. 10048); from the signification of the "head" as being the inmost (n. 5328, 6436, 9656, 9913, 9914); and from the signification of the "intestines and legs" which were to 
be put upon them, as being things outermost and outer (that the "intestines" denote things outermost or lowest, see n. 10030; and that the "legs" denote outer or exterior things, n. 10050); and from 
the signification of "putting the latter upon the former," as being to set in order. That it denotes to set in order exterior things under interior ones, and not "upon" them according to the sense of 
the letter, is because the altar and the fire upon the altar denote things highest or inmost; for the altar represented the Divine Human of the Lord as to Divine good, and the fire the Divine love itself; 
and therefore those parts from the ram and the burnt-offering that were nearest to the fire of the altar, were higher or interior; and those which had a place above them, being more remote from 
the fire of the altar, were lower or exterior. For in the internal sense those things are regarded as higher or interior which are nearest to the highest, and those as lower or exterior which are more 
remote from it, differently than in the sense of the letter. Whether we speak of things higher and lower, or of things interior and exterior, it is the same, for that which is higher is interior, and 
that which is lower is exterior (n. 2148, 3084, 4599, 5146, 8325). From this it is now plain that by "putting the intestines and the legs upon the pieces and upon the head" is signified that things outermost 
and outer were to be set in order under things interior and inmost. (That the altar was representative of the Lord's Divine Human as to Divine good, see n. 921, 2777, 2811, 9388, 9389, 9714, 
9964; and that the fire of the altar denotes His Divine love, see n. 6832.) </p>

'And put them on top of its pieces and of its head' means the arrangement into order of the more external things under the interior and under the inmost ones. This is clear from the meaning of 'pieces' 
as the interior things, dealt with above in <a href="10048.htm">10048</a>; from the meaning of 'the head' as what is inmost, dealt with in <a href="5328.htm">5328</a>, <a href="6436.htm">6436</a>, <a href="9656.htm">9656</a>, <a href="9913.htm">9913</a>, <a href="9914.htm">9914</a>; from the meaning of 'the intestines and the legs', which 
were to be put on top of them, as the outermost and the more external things (for the meaning of 'the intestines' as the outermost or lowest things, see <a href="10030.htm">10030</a>, and for that of 'the legs' as the more 
external things, <a href="10050.htm">10050</a>); and from the meaning of 'putting these on top of the others' as arranging them into order. The reason why arranging the more external things into order under the interior 
ones is meant and not, according to the literal sense, above them is that the altar and the fire on the altar are the highest or inmost things. For the altar represented the Lord's Divine Human in respect 
of Divine Good, and the fire His actual Divine Love, and therefore the parts of the ram and burnt offering nearest the fire of the altar were higher or more internal, while those on top of them, 
being further away from the fire of the altar, were lower or more external. For in the internal sense the things nearest to what is highest are regarded as being higher or more internal, and those that 
are further away from it are regarded as being lower or more external, unlike the way things are stated in the literal sense. Whether you say higher and lower ones, or more internal and more external, 
it amounts to the same thing, because what is higher is more internal and what is lower is more external, <a href="2148.htm">2148</a>, <a href="3084.htm">3084</a>, <a href="4599.htm">4599</a>, <a href="5146.htm">5146</a>, <a href="8325.htm">8325</a>. From this it is now evident that 'you shall put the intestines 
and legs on top of the pieces and on top of the head' means that the outermost and the more external things must be arranged into order under the interior and the inmost ones.  </p>
<p>The altar was representative 
of the Lord's Divine Human in respect of Divine Good, see <a href="921.htm">921</a>, <a href="2777.htm">2777</a>, <a href="2811.htm">2811</a>, <a href="9388.htm">9388</a>, <a href="9389.htm">9389</a>, <a href="9714.htm">9714</a>, <a href="9964.htm">9964</a>.

`Et dabis super segmenta ejus et super caput': quod significet ordinationem exteriorum sub interioribus et intimis, constat (c)ex significatione `segmentorum' quod sint interiora, de qua supra n. 10,048, 
et ex significatione `capitis' quod sit intimum {1}, de qua n. 5328, 6436, 9656, 9913, 9914, et ex significatione `intestinorum et crurum' quae darentur super illa, quod sint extrema et exteriora; 
quod `intestina' sint extrema seu infima, videatur n. 10,030, et quod `crura' sint exteriora, n. 10,050; et ex significatione `dare haec super illa' quod sit ordinare.  Quod sit ordinare exteriora 
sub interioribus, et non super illa secundum sensum litterae, est quia altare et ignis super altari sunt suprema seu intima {2}, altare enim repraesentabat Divinum Humanum Domini quoad Divinum Bonum, 
et ignis ipsum Divinum Amorem, quapropter illa quae ex ariete et {3} holocausto erant proxima igni altaris, erant superiora seu interiora, et quae locum supra illa habebant, quia remotiora ab igne altaris, 
erant inferiora seu exteriora; in sensu enim interno spectantur illa ut superiora (o)seu interiora quae sunt proxima {4} supremo, ac ut inferiora (o)seu exteriora quae sunt remotiora ab illo, secus 
ac in sensu litterae {5}; sive dicas superiora et inferiora, sive interiora et exteriora, idem est, nam quod superius est, hoc interius est, et quod inferius est, hoc exterius est, n. 2148, 3084, 
4599, 5146, 8325; (m)inde nunc patet quod per `dabis intestina (c)et crura super segmenta et [super] caput' significetur quod extrema et exteriora ordinanda sint sub interioribus ac intimis.(n)  Quod
