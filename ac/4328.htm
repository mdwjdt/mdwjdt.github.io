<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4328节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4328.</strong>我还曾被指示心智的意愿或意志部分和理解部分总体上是何情形。构成主的属天教会的上古之人（参看<a href="1114.htm">1114</a>-<a href="1123.htm">1123</a>节）就具有包含良善的意愿或意志和包含源自那良善的真理的理解；对他们来说，这二者合而为一。然而，形成主的属灵教会的古人具有完全被摧毁的意愿或意志，但仍具有完好无损的理解，主通过使人重生在这理解里面形成一个新的意愿或意志，并通过这新的意愿或意志也形成一个新的理解（参看<a href="863.htm">863</a>，<a href="875.htm">875</a>，<a href="895.htm">895</a>，<a href="927.htm">927</a>，<a href="928.htm">928</a>，<a href="1023.htm">1023</a>，<a href="1043.htm">1043</a>，<a href="1044.htm">1044</a>，<a href="1555.htm">1555</a>，<a href="2256.htm">2256</a>节）。<br />就良善而言，属天教会是何情形，可通过从天而降的蓝柱来说明；蓝柱的左侧充满光明，就像太阳放射的炽热火光。这代表那些人的第一个状态；蓝色代表他们的意愿或意志，也就是良善；炽热火光代表他们的理解。后来，这个柱子的蓝色变得暗红，这代表他们的第二个状态；在这种状态下，他们的两种生命，即意愿的生命和理解的生命，仍行如一体，只是就来自意愿的良善而言，更为暗淡了。因为蓝色表示良善，而炽热的火光表示源自良善的真理。<br />此后，柱子完全变黑了；柱子周围有一道通过某种闪光事物而斑驳并呈现出各种颜色的亮光；这些变化表示属灵教会的状态。黑色柱子表示意愿或意志完全被毁，无非是邪恶；通过某种闪光事物而斑驳的亮光表示主在理解中提供了一个新的意愿或意志；因为在天上，理解由亮光来代表。</p>

I have also been shown how the case is in general with the voluntary (or will part) and with the intellectual. The most ancients, who constituted the Lord's celestial church (see n. 1114-1123), had a 
voluntary in which was good, and an intellectual in which was the derivative truth, which two with them made a one. But the ancients, who formed the Lord's spiritual church, had the voluntary altogether 
destroyed, but the intellectual entire, in which the Lord by regeneration formed a new voluntary, and through this also a new intellectual (see n. 863, 875, 895, 927, 928, 1023, 1043, 1044, 1555, 
2256). [2] How the case had been with the good of the celestial church was shown by a column descending from heaven, of an azure color, at the left side of which there was a lucidity like the flaming 
glow of the sun. By this was represented their first state; by the azure color their good voluntary; and by the flaming glow their intellectual. And afterwards the azure of the column passed into a dim 
flaminess by which was represented their second state, and that their two lives-of the will and the understanding-still acted as a one, but more dimly as to good from the will; for what is azure signifies 
good, and a flaming glow truth from good.  [3] Presently the column became quite black; and around the column there was a lucidity which was variegated by something of shining white, presenting 
colors; by which was signified the state of the spiritual church. The black column signified the voluntary as being altogether destroyed, and as being nothing but evil; the lucidity variegated by something 
of shining white signified the intellectual in which was a new voluntary from the Lord; for the intellectual is represented in heaven by what is lucid. </p>

I have also been shown the situation in general with regard to the will part of the mind and the understanding part. The most ancient people who constituted the Lord's celestial Church, and who are described 
in <a href="1114.htm">1114</a>-<a href="1123.htm">1123</a>, had a will which contained good and an understanding which contained truth derived from that good; and with them these two parts made one. The ancients however who formed the Lord's 
spiritual Church had a will that was completely destroyed, but an intact understanding within which, through regeneration, the Lord formed a new area of will, and through this a new area of understanding 
also, see <a href="863.htm">863</a>, <a href="875.htm">875</a>, <a href="895.htm">895</a>, <a href="927.htm">927</a>, <a href="928.htm">928</a>, <a href="1023.htm">1023</a>, <a href="1043.htm">1043</a>, <a href="1044.htm">1044</a>, <a href="1555.htm">1555</a>, <a href="2256.htm">2256</a>. </p>

 What the situation had been in the celestial Church so far as good was concerned was demonstrated by means of a blue-coloured 
column coming down from the sky, the left side of which was full of light, like the blazing light of the sun. This was a representation of the first state of those people, the blue colour representing 
their will, which was good, and the blazing light their understanding. After that the blue of the column turned to a dull red, which was a representation of their second state, a state in which 
their two kinds of life - that of the will and that of the understanding - still acted as one, though this was more dull so far as good from the will was concerned. For blue means good, and blazing 
light truth derived from good. After that the column became completely black, and surrounding the column there was a brightness which was variegated by means of something glittering and which presented 
colours. These changes meant the state of the spiritual Church. The black column meant that the will had been completely destroyed and that it was nothing but evil. The light variegated by something 
glittering meant the understanding in which a new will was provided by the Lord; for in heaven the understanding is represented by brightness. </p>

Ostensum mihi quoque est quomodo se habet in communi cum voluntario et cum intellectuali; antiquissimi qui Ecclesiam caelestem Domini constituerunt, de quibus n. 1114-1123, habuerunt voluntarium 
in quo bonum, ac intellectuale in quo verum inde, quae duo apud illos faciebant unum; at antiqui qui Ecclesiam spiritualem Domini formarunt, habuerunt voluntarium prorsus deperditum, sed intellectuale 
integrum in quo Dominus per regenerationem formabat novum voluntarium et per id quoque novum intellectuale, videatur n. 863, 875, 895, 927, 928, 1023, 1043, 1044, 1555, 2256.  [2] Quomodo Ecclesiae 
caelestis bonum fuerat, ostensum est per columnam e caelo descendentem quae coloris caerulei erat, ad cujus latus sinistrum erat {1} lucidum sicut lucidum flammeum solare; per haec {2} repraesentabatur 
status eorum primus, per colorem caeruleum illorum bonum voluntarium et per lucidum flammeum (c)illorum intellectuale: </p>
<p>{3} et postea caeruleum columnae transibat in flammeum obscurum, per 
quod repraesentabatur status eorum secundus, et quod binae eorum vitae, nempe voluntatis et intellectus, usque unum agerent sed obscurius quoad bonum e voluntate; caeruleum enim significat bonum, 
lucidum flammeum verum ex bono.  Postmodum columna {4} illa facta est prorsus nigra, et circum columnam erat lucidum, quod variegabatur per quoddam candescens, et sistebat colores, quibus significabatur 
status Ecclesiae spiritualis; columna nigra significabat voluntarium quod prorsus deperditum esset, et quod non nisi quam malum; lucidum variegatum per quoddam candescens significabat intellectuale 
in quo novum voluntarium a Domino; </p>
<p>intellectuale enim in caelo repraesentatur per lucidum.      @1 apparuit$      @2 hoc$      @3 at$      @4 i autem$ </p>
