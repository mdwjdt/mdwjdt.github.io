<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第267节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>267.</strong>创世记3:17 又对亚当说，你既听从妻子的话，吃了我吩咐你不可吃的那树，土必为你的缘故受咒诅。你必终身劳苦，才能从土里得吃的。<br />“听从妻子的话”表理性的认同，理性既表示了认同，就自我颠倒了，招来了咒诅。人的整个外在也受到了咒诅，亦即“土必为你的缘故受咒诅”所表示的。“劳苦得吃”表示他将来的生活将变得痛苦不堪，直到该教会走到尽头，“终身”即表示它的尽头。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]267.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_267/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_17" target=_top>Genesis 3:17</a>. And to the human he said, "Because you listened to the voice of your wife and ate from the tree concerning which I commanded you, saying, ‘You will not eat from it,' a curse on the ground because of you! In great pain you will eat from it all the days of your life."<br />The human, in listening to the voice of his wife, symbolizes a man, that is, the rational faculty, and the fact that it consented. Because the rational mind consented, it also turned away or brought a curse on itself. On this account, the whole outer self did the same, which is what is symbolized by a curse on the ground because of you. His eating from it in great pain, which means the unhappy condition of life to come, was to last right to the end of that church — all the days of his life. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 267</b></p><p><b>267.</b>
Verse 17. And unto the man He said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it; cursed is the ground 
for thy sake, in great sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. By the "man hearkening to the voice of his wife" is signified the consent of the man [vir], or rational, by which it also 
averted or cursed itself, and consequently the whole external man, denoted by "cursed is the ground for thy sake." To "eat thereof in sorrow" means that the future state of his life would be miserable, 
and this even to the end of that church, or "all the days of his life." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 267</b></p><p><b>267.</b>
Verse 17 And to the man He said, Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten from the tree of which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat from it, cursed be the ground on 
account of you; in great pain you will eat of it all the days of your life.  </p>
<p>'The man's having listened to the voice of his wife' means that the husband (vir), which was the rational, conceded; and 
because the rational did concede it also turned away, that is, brought a curse upon itself, and so consequently did the whole external man. This is what is meant by the statement 'cursed be the ground 
on account of you'. That in future his state of life would be wretched is meant by the statement 'in great pain you will eat from it'. 'All the days of his life' means right down to the end of that Church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 267</b>
</p><b>267.</b>
Vers. 17.  Et ad hominem dixit, Quia audivisti vocem uxoris tuae, et comedisti de arbore, de qua praecepi tibi, dicendo, Non edes de illa, maledicta humus propter te: in magno dolore edes de ea, omnibus 
diebus vitae tuae. Per 'hominem, quod audiverit vocem uxoris suae' significatur vir seu rationale, quod consenserit; et quia rationale consensit, se quoque avertit seu sibi maledixit, et propterea 
totus homo externus, quae significantur per quod 'maledicta humus propter te': quod status ejus vitae miserabilis futura, est quod 'in magno dolore ederet de ea'; et quidem usque ad Ecclesiae istius 
finem, quod est 'omnibus diebus vitae suae.' </p>
