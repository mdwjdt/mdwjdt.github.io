<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7356节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7356.</strong>“进你的烤炉和你的抟面盆”表进入属于恶欲的快乐。这从“烤炉”和“抟面盆”的含义清楚可知。“烤炉”是指外层良善，因为饼在烤炉中烘烤，外层良善是指那些存在于属世层中，通常称为快乐的事物；因为当内层良善，也就是爱及其情感的分枝流入属世层时，它们在那里被感觉为快乐。“烤炉”在正面意义上表示这些快乐；但在反面意义上，如此处的情形，表示属于恶欲的快乐，也就是源于地狱之爱的快乐，地狱的爱就是自我之爱和尘世之爱。“抟面盆”也是指属世层中属于恶欲的快乐，不过是更外在的那种，因为抟面盆是制饼时预备面团的器皿。另一种说法，即推理将进入属于恶欲的快乐，意思是说利用虚假所生的推理去欺骗和迷惑他人将是他们生命的快乐。此外，恶人以四处传播虚假、确证它们，嘲笑真理，尤其迷惑他人为首要快乐。<br />“烤炉或火炉”表示伴随仁与信的情感的快乐，在反面意义上表示伴随自我之爱和尘世之爱的恶欲的快乐。这一点明显可见于何西阿书：<br />他们都是行淫的，像被烤饼的烧热的火炉，从抟面到发面的时候，暂时停止煽火。他们埋伏的时候，心中就如火炉；就如烤饼的整夜睡卧，到了早晨却如火焰熊熊。他们都热如火炉，烧灭他们的审判官；一切君王都仆倒。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何7.4.htm">7:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/何7.6.htm">6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何7.7.htm">7</a>）<br />“烤炉或火炉”表示属于恶欲，也就是恶人欲望的快乐；“烧”、“热”和“火焰”表示欲望本身；“火”是指对邪恶的欲他们望（参看<a href="1297.htm">1297</a>，<a href="1861.htm">1861</a>，<a href="2446.htm">2446</a>，<a href="5071.htm">5071</a>，<a href="5215.htm">5215</a>，<a href="6314.htm">6314</a>，<a href="6832.htm">6832</a>，<a href="7324.htm">7324</a>e节）。“他们烧灭他们的审判官；一切君王都仆倒”表示他们毁灭良善与真理。谁都能看出，没有像这样的一个内义，没有人能知道此处“他们都是行淫的，像被烤饼的烧热的火炉，他们都热如火炉，烧灭他们的审判官”是什么意思。<br />在以赛亚书，“烤炉或火炉”用于正面意义：<br />这是那有火炉在锡安、有烤炉在耶路撒冷的耶和华说的。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛31.9.htm">31:9</a>）<br />“锡安”表示属天教会，因而表示爱之良善，也就是该教会的良善；“耶路撒冷”表示属灵教会，因而表示这教会中的爱之良善，也就是仁和由此而来的信之良善。在这段经文中，“烤炉”表示对良善与真理的情感的更内在快乐。“烤炉”之所以具有这种含义，是因为在烤炉中所烤的饼表示属天和属灵之爱的良善，因为“饼”表示这种良善（参看<a href="276.htm">276</a>，<a href="680.htm">680</a>，<a href="2165.htm">2165</a>，<a href="2177.htm">2177</a>，<a href="3464.htm">3464</a>，<a href="3478.htm">3478</a>，<a href="3735.htm">3735</a>，<a href="3813.htm">3813</a>，<a href="4211.htm">4211</a>，<a href="4217.htm">4217</a>，<a href="4735.htm">4735</a>，<a href="4976.htm">4976</a>，<a href="5915.htm">5915</a>节）。由于“烤炉”的含义由此而来，所以为祭祀而在烤炉中所烤并被称为“素祭”的饼有别于在平底锅中所烤的素祭，也有别于在有盖的平底锅中所烤的素祭（参看利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利2.4.htm">2:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利2.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利2.7.htm">7</a>）。素祭的这些种类表示爱之良善的不同种类。</p>

And into thine ovens, and into thy kneading-troughs. That this signifies into the delights of cupidities is evident from the signification of "ovens" as being exterior goods, because in them the bread 
is made ready, and exterior goods are those which are in the natural, and are commonly called delights; for when the interior goods which are of the loves and their affections flow into the natural, 
they are felt there as delights. These are signified by "ovens" in a good sense; but in the opposite sense, as here, by "ovens" are signified the delights of cupidities, that is, delights from the loves 
of hell, which are the loves of self and of the world. And from the signification of "kneading-troughs" as being also the delights of cupidities in the natural, but still more external, because kneading-troughs 
are vessels in which dough is prepared for bread. By reasonings entering into the delights of cupidities is meant that it would be the delight of their life to reason from falsities, and 
thus to deceive and seduce others. It is moreover one of the chief delights of the evil to spread falsities, to confirm them, to deride truths, and especially to seduce others. [2] That an "oven" denotes 
the delight of the affections which are of charity and faith, and in the opposite sense the delight of the cupidities which are of the love of self and the love of the world, is plain in Hosea: </p>
<p> 
    They are all adulterers; they are as an oven heated by the baker; the stirrer ceaseth from kneading his dough; when they turn their mind like an oven in their lying in wait; their baker sleepeth 
all the night; in the morning it burneth as flames of fire. They were all hot as an oven, and devour their judges; all the kings thereof fall (Hos. 7:4, 6-7); </p>
<p>"an oven" denotes the delights of the 
cupidities which are of evils; "burning," "being hot," "flames of fire," denote the cupidities themselves. (That "fire" denotes the yearning of evil, see n. 1297, 1861, 2446, 5071, 5215, 6314, 6832, 7324e.) 
"They devour their judges, all their kings fall" denotes that goods and truths perish. Everyone can see that without an internal sense such as this, it cannot be known what is here meant by "all 
the adulterers are as an oven heated by the baker, all grow hot as an oven, they devour the judges, and their kings fall." [3] "Oven" is used in a good sense in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The saying of Jehovah 
whose hearth is in Zion, and His oven in Jerusalem (Isa. 31:9); </p>
<p>where "Zion" denotes the celestial church, thus the good of love which is of this church; "Jerusalem," the spiritual church, thus the good 
of this love, which is the good of charity and of the derivative faith. In this passage "oven" denotes the interior delight of the affections of good and truth; and this because the bread which is 
baked in an oven signifies the good of celestial and spiritual love (that "bread" signifies this, see n. 276, 680, 2165, 2177, 3464, 3478, 3735, 3813, 4211, 4217, 4735, 4976, 5915). And as the signification 
of an "oven" comes from this, therefore the bread which was prepared in an oven for the sacrifices, and was called a "meat-offering," was distinguished from the meat-offering that was prepared 
in a pan, and from the meat-offering that was prepared in a cooking pot (see Lev. 2:4-5, 7); it was varieties of the good of love that were hereby signified. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7356</b></p><p><b>7356.</b>
'And into your ovens, and into your kneading bowls' means into delights belonging to evil desires. This is clear from the meaning of 'ovens', since they are what bread is baked in, as forms of exterior 
good (forms of exterior good being those which exist in the natural and are as a general rule called delights; for when forms of interior good, which are offshoots of [heavenly] kinds of love and resulting 
affections, pass into the natural they are experienced as delights there, and these delights are meant in a good sense by 'ovens') or in the contrary sense, in which 'ovens' is used here, as 
delights belonging to evil desires, that is, delights springing from hellish kinds of love, which are self-love and love of the world; and from the meaning of 'kneading bowls' too as delights belonging 
to evil desires in the natural, but even more external ones since kneading bowls are the vessels in which the dough is prepared when bread is made. Another way of saying that reasonings will enter into 
delights belonging to evil desires is to say that it will be the delight of their life to use reasonings arising from falsities to deceive others and lead them astray. Indeed the evil take very great 
delight in spreading falsities around, proving that they are well-founded, mocking truths, and especially leading others astray. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that 'an oven' means delight belonging to affections 
that go with charity and faith, and in the contrary sense delight belonging to evil desires that go with selfish and worldly love, is evident in Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
They are all committing adultery, like an oven 
heated by a baker; the raiser<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> ceases from kneading his dough When like an oven they transform<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> their desire (animus) while they lie in wait, their baker being sleepy all night, in the morning it 
is burning, like a flaming fire. All become hot, like an oven, and devour their judges; all their kings fall. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%207:4,%206,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 7:4, 6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Oven' stands for delight belonging to evil desires, which are evil people's 
desires. 'Burning', 'becoming hot', and 'flaming fire' stand for the desires themselves, 'fire being the desire for evil, see <a href="1297.htm">1297</a>, <a href="1861.htm">1861</a>, <a href="2446.htm">2446</a>, <a href="5071.htm">5071</a>, <a href="5215.htm">5215</a>, <a href="6314.htm">6314</a>, <a href="6832.htm">6832</a>, <a href="7324.htm">7324</a> (end). 'They devour 
their judges; all their kings fall' stands for the fact that they destroy forms of good and truths. Anyone may see that without the internal sense in which such things are meant nobody can know what 
'they are all committing adultery, like an oven heated by a baker' is, or 'all become hot, like an oven, and devour their judges', and 'their kings fall'.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 'Oven' is used in the good sense in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The 
saying of Jehovah, whose hearth is in Zion, and His oven in Jerusalem. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2031:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 31:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Zion' stands for the celestial Church, thus for the good of love, which is the good of this Church, 
'Jerusalem' for the spiritual Church, thus for the good of love in this Church, which is the good of charity and consequently of faith, while 'oven' here stands for more internal delight belonging to 
affections for goodness and truth. 'Oven' has this meaning because the bread which is baked in an oven means the good of celestial and spiritual love, for which meaning of 'bread' see <a href="276.htm">276</a>, <a href="680.htm">680</a>, <a href="2165.htm">2165</a>, <a href="2177.htm">2177</a>, <a href="3464.htm">3464</a>, <a href="3478.htm">3478</a>, <a href="3775.htm">3775</a>, <a href="3813.htm">3813</a>, <a href="4211.htm">4211</a>, <a href="4217.htm">4217</a>, <a href="4735.htm">4735</a>, <a href="4976.htm">4976</a>, <a href="5915.htm">5915</a>. And as 'oven' receives its meaning from this, the bread called a minchah that was baked for sacrifices in an oven was distinguished from the 
minchah baked on a griddle, and from the minchah baked in a covered pan, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%202:4,%205,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 2:4, 5, 7</a>. Different forms of the good of love were meant by these varieties of minchah.

`Et in clibanos tuos, et in mactras tuas': quod significet in jucunda cupiditatum, constat ex significatione `clibanorum' quod quia sunt illa in quibus conficitur panis, sint bona exteriora, et bona 
exteriora sunt illa quae in naturali sunt, et communiter vocantur jucunda; nam bona interiora, quae sunt amorum et inde affectionum, cum influunt in naturale, sentiuntur ibi ut jucunda; haec significantur 
per `clibanos' in (t)bono sensu; at in opposito, ut hic, per `clibanos' significantur jucunda cupiditatum, hoc est, jucunda ex amoribus inferni, qui amores sunt amores sui et mundi; et ex significatione 
`mactrarum' quod quoque sint jucunda cupiditatum in naturali, sed adhuc exteriora, quia mactrae sunt vasa in quibus massa pro pane praeparatur.  (m)Per quod ratiocinia intrabunt in jucunda cupiditatum, 
intelligitur quod jucundum vitae eorum erit ratiocinari ex falsis, ac ita fallere et seducere alios; malis etiam inter jucundiora est falsa spargere, (t)illa confirmare, {1} vera subsannare, 
imprimis alios seducere.(n) 	2 Quod `clibanus' sit jucundum affectionum quae sunt charitatis et fidei, et in opposito sensu jucundum cupiditatum quae sunt amoris sui et mundi, patet apud Hoscheam, Omnes 
adulterantes, sicut clibanus accensus a pistore, cessat excitator a subigendo massam ejus; quando (x)convertunt sicut clibanus animum in insidiari suo, tota nocte dormitans pistor eorum, mane ille 
ardens, sicut ignis flammae; omnes incalescunt sicut clibanus, et (x)comedunt judices suos, omnes reges (x)eorum cadunt, vii 4, 6, 7; </p>
<p>`clibanus' pro jucundo cupiditatum, quae sunt malorum; `ardere, 
incalescere, ignis flammae' pro ipsis cupiditatibus; quod `ignis' sit cupiditas mali, videatur n. 1297, 1861, 2446, 5071, 5215, 6314, 6832, (x)7324 fin.; (m)`comedunt judices suos, omnes reges cadunt'

<p>`Zion' pro Ecclesia 
caelesti, ita pro bono amoris quod est illius Ecclesiae, `Hierosolyma' pro Ecclesia spirituali, ita pro bono illius amoris quod est bonum charitatis et inde fidei, hic `clibanus' pro jucundo interiore
