<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1226节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1226.</strong>“闪的儿子”表智慧的属性。这仅从以下事实清楚可知：“闪”既是内在教会，那么他的儿子无非表智慧的属性。源于仁爱的一切事物都被称为智慧，因为它通过仁爱来自主，一切智慧的源头，而主是智慧本身。从这智慧而来的才是真聪明、真知识和真认知。所有这些都是仁爱的“儿子”，即主通过仁爱所生的儿子。由于它们是主通过仁爱所生的儿子，故它们各自都指向智慧，因为各自里面都有智慧，它们从这智慧那里汲取自己的生命。事实上，聪明、知识、认知同样只能从属于仁爱，就是属于主的智慧那里接受生命。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1226.</strong> The sons of Shem symbolize attributes that are forms of wisdom. The fact that Shem is the inner church, whose offspring are nothing else than forms of wisdom, is not the only indication of this symbolism. Wisdom is the term for everything that charity fathers, because whatever charity fathers comes by way of charity from the Lord, who is the source of all wisdom, since he is wisdom itself. This is the origin of true understanding, which is the origin of true learning, which is the origin of true knowledge. All three are the offspring of charity, or in other words, children of the Lord by way of charity. Because they are children of the Lord by way of charity, each is described as a form of wisdom. This is because each of them contains wisdom, from which they draw their life. In fact not one of them — not understanding or secular learning or religious knowledge — has any life except that drawn from wisdom, which belongs to charity, which is the Lord's. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1226</b></p><p><b>1226.</b>
That by "the sons of Shem" are signified the things that are of wisdom, is evident merely from Shem's being an internal church, the sons of which are none other than things of wisdom. Everything is called 
wisdom that is begotten of charity, because it comes by means of charity from the Lord, from whom is all wisdom, for He is wisdom itself. Hence comes true intelligence, and hence comes true memory-knowledge, 
and hence comes true knowledge, which are all sons of charity, that is, sons of the Lord through charity. And because they are sons of the Lord through charity, wisdom is predicated of each 
of them, for wisdom is in each of them, and they draw their life from it, and this in such a manner that neither intelligence, nor memory-knowledge, nor knowledge, has life except from the wisdom 
which is of charity, which is of the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1226</b></p><p><b>1226.</b>
That 'the sons of Shem' means the attributes of wisdom is clear merely from the fact that 'Shem' is the internal Church whose sons mean nothing else than attributes of wisdom. The expression wisdom is 
used for everything that springs from charity, for it comes by way of charity from the Lord, the source of all wisdom because He is Wisdom itself. From that Wisdom true intelligence derives, also true 
knowledge, and true cognition. All of these are 'sons' of charity, that is, the Lord's sons begotten by means of charity. And because they are the Lord's sons begotten by means of charity, each one 
is referred to as wisdom, for each one has within itself wisdom from which it draws its life; so much so in fact that neither intelligence nor knowledge, nor cognition, receives any life except from 
the wisdom that belongs to charity, which is the Lord's. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1226</b>
</p><b>1226.</b>
Quod per 'filios Shemi' significentur illa quae sunt sapientiae, constat non modo ab eo quod 'Shem' sit Ecclesia interna cujus 'filii' non alii sunt quam sapientiae; sapientia dicitur omne id quod gignitur 
ex charitate, quia per charitatem a Domino, a Quo omnis sapientia, quia est ipsa Sapientia; inde vera intelligentia, et inde vera scientia, et inde vera cognitio, quae omnia sunt 'filii' charitatis, 
hoc est, filii Domini per charitatem; et quia sunt filii Domini per charitatem, de singulis praedicatur sapientia; nam in singulis est sapientia, e qua suam vitam ducunt, et quidem ita ut non intelligentia, 
nec scientia, neque cognitio vivat nisi ex sapientia quae est charitatis, quae Domini. </p>
