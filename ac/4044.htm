<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4044节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4044.</strong>代表无非是属灵事物在属世事物中的形像，当前者在后者里面准确呈现出来时，这二者就相对应。然而，人若不知道何为属灵维度，只知道何为属世维度，就会以为这种代表和随之产生的对应是不可能的。因为他会对自己说，属灵之物如何能作用于物质？但是，他若认真思考自己里面每时每刻都在发生的事，就能对这些事获得某种概念；也就是说，他若思考意愿如何能作用于身体的肌肉，并产生实际动作；以及思维如何能作用于发声器官，驱动肺、气管、喉、舌和唇，从而产生言语；还有情感如何能作用面部，在那里呈现出自己的形像，以致由此常常就知道另一个人在思想和意愿什么。这些例子可以给出代表和对应的某种概念。由于这类事物在人里面产生，而没有任何事物凭自己持续存在，只能通过某种其它事物存在，而这某种其它事物又通过某种其它事物存在，最终通过那首先的存在，故那些享有某种相当程度的判断力之就能推断出，人与天堂，以及天堂与主，就是那首先的之间存在一种对应关系。</p>

Representations are nothing but images of spiritual things in natural ones, and when the former are rightly represented in the latter, the two correspond. Yet the man who knows not what the spiritual 
is, but only the natural, is capable of thinking that such representations and derivative correspondences are impossible, for he might say to himself, How can the spiritual act upon the material? But 
if he will reflect upon the things taking place in himself every moment, he may be able to gain some idea of these matters; namely, how the will can act upon the muscles of the body, and effect real 
actions; also how thought can act upon the organs of speech, moving the lungs, trachea, throat, tongue, and lips, and thus produce speech; and also how the affections can act on the face, and there present 
images of themselves, so that another often thereby knows what is being thought and felt. These examples may give some idea of what representations and correspondences are. As such things are now 
presented in man, and as there is nothing that can subsist from itself, but only from some other, and this again from some other, and finally from the First, and this by a nexus of correspondences, 
they who enjoy some extension of judgment may draw the conclusion that there is a correspondence between man and heaven; and further, between heaven and the Lord who is the First. </p>

Representations are nothing else than images of spiritual things manifested in natural ones, and when the former are accurately represented in the latter they correspond. But anyone who does not know 
what the spiritual dimension is but only what the natural is may imagine that such representations and consequent correspondences are not possible. For he might say to himself, How can that which is 
spiritual act on that which is material? But if he will reflect on the things taking place every moment within himself he will be able to gain some concept of them - that is to say, if he will reflect 
on how the will can act on the muscles of the body and produce actual movements; or on how thought can act on the organs of speech, by moving the lungs, windpipe, throat, tongue, and lips, and so produce 
speech; also on how affections can act on the face and there produce images of themselves, so much so that from these one person often knows what another thinks and wills. These actions are able 
to provide some idea of representations and correspondences. Now as such things are produced in man and not one continues to be produced there by itself but is effected by something else, and this is 
effected by something else again, which finally is effected by the First - all of which is achieved by means of a connected series of correspondences - those who enjoy some fair measure of judgement may 
deduce that there is a correspondence between the human being and heaven, and in addition between heaven and the Lord, who is the First. </p>

Repraesentationes non aliud sunt quam imagines spiritualium in naturalibus, et cum illa rite repraesentantur in his, tunc correspondent: at qui non novit quid spirituale est, sed solum quid naturale, 
is putare potest quod tales repraesentationes et inde correspondentiae non dari possent, dicere enim apud se, quomodo potest spirituale agere in materiale; sed si velit reflectere super illa quae 
in se quolibet momento fiunt, aliquam ideam illorum sibi poterit comparare, nempe quomodo voluntas potest agere in musculos corporis et sistere reales actiones, et quoque quomodo cogitatio potest 
agere in organa loquelae, movendo pulmones, tracheam, guttur, linguam, labia, et sistere loquelam, tum quomodo affectiones agere possint in faciem, et ibi sistere sui imagines, adeo ut inde sciat 
saepe alter quid cogitet et velit; haec possunt dare aliquam ideam repraesentationum et correspondentiarum; quia nunc talia sistuntur in homine, et quia non datur aliquid quod subsistere potest a 
se, sed ab alio, et hoc rursus ab alio, et demum a Primo, et id per nexum correspondentiarum, inde {1}possunt illi qui aliqua judicii extensione {2}gaudent, concludere quod inter hominem et caelum 
correspondentia sit, et porro quod inter caelum et Dominum, Qui Primus. @1 potest$ @2 gaudet$ </p>
