<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2543节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2543.</strong>“这些男人都甚惧怕”表直到他们感到厌恶。这从此处“惧怕”和“男人”的含义清楚可知。“惧怕”或恐惧和其它所有情绪一样，尽管表面看似单一，实则包含很多事在里面，也就是说，这种惧怕将丧失生命、名声、荣誉和利益包括在世俗事务中，将丧失善与真，以及由此而来的生命包括在天堂事务中。惧怕包含这些事，故也包含对凡努力摧毁它们的任何事的厌恶；当人具有对善与真的情感本身时，尤其如此。这种厌恶是情感的对立面，因此“惧怕”在此表示感到厌恶。主的厌恶何等之大，可从对下一节所说之事的强烈反应明显看出来；这种强烈反对是针对教义的，即觉得教义不应该被理性之物或记忆知识之物所玷污。“男人”表理性事物和记忆知识，或属心智理解力部分的一切事物，如前所示（<a href="158.htm">158</a>，<a href="265.htm">265</a>，<a href="749.htm">749</a>，<a href="915.htm">915</a>，<a href="1007.htm">1007</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2543</b></p><p><b>2543.</b>
The men feared greatly. That this signifies even until they should become averse, is evident from the signification here of "fearing;" and from the signification of the "men." "Fearing," or "fear," like 
all other emotions, though in appearance simple, involves in itself many things, namely, in worldly matters the loss of life, of reputation, of honor, and of gain; and in heavenly matters the loss 
of what is good and true, and of the life thence derived. As fear involves these things it also involves aversion to whatever endeavors to destroy them; and this the more in proportion as the man is 
in the affection of what is good and true. To this very affection aversion is the opposite or contrary, and therefore by "fearing" is here signified to become averse. How great was the Lord's aversion 
is evident from the zeal with which the things in the next verse are said; which zeal was for doctrine, that it might be free from contamination by anything rational or by anything of memory-knowledge. 
(That "men" signify rational things and memory-knowledges, or all intellectual things whatever, has been shown above, n. 158, 265, 749, 915, 1007.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2543</b></p><p><b>2543.</b>
'The men were very much afraid' means until they should become averse. This is clear from the meaning here of 'being afraid' and from the meaning of 'men'. As with every emotion, being afraid or fear 
includes many things within it, even though it looks to be simple and without parts. That is to say, this fear includes loss of life, or reputation, or position, or gain in worldly things, but also loss 
of good and truth, and so of life, in heavenly things. And because it includes these, it also includes aversion to those things which endeavour to destroy them; and this is all the more the case when 
an affection itself for what is good and true exists with a person. Such aversion is the opposite of the affection and therefore 'being afraid' here means feeling aversion. The greatness of the Lord's 
aversion is clear from the strong feeling with which things are stated in the next verse, a strong feeling that doctrine should not be debased by anything of a rational or factual kind. For 'men' 
means rational concepts and factual knowledge, that is, everything that belongs to the understanding part of the mind, as has been shown in <a href="158.htm">158</a>, <a href="265.htm">265</a>, <a href="749.htm">749</a>, <a href="915.htm">915</a>, <a href="1007.htm">1007</a>. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2543</b>
</p><b>2543.</b>
Quod `timuerunt viri valde' significet quod usque ut aversarentur, constat ex significatione `timere' hic, et a significatione `virorum': timere seu timor plura in se, sicut omnis affectus, involvit, 
tametsi apparet simplex, nempe jacturam vitae, famae, honoris, lucri in mundanis, at jacturam boni et veri, et inde vitae, in caelestibus; et quia haec, etiam involvit aversationem pro illis quae destruere 
ea conantur, et hoc quo magis homo in affectione boni et veri est; ipsi affectioni opposita est aversatio, quare hic per timere significatur aversari; quanta aversatio fuerit Domino, constat ex 
zelo in quo dicta sunt illa quae in versu nunc sequente, qui zelus fuit pro doctrina ut incontaminata esset ab omni rationali et scientifico: quod `viri' significent rationalia et scientifica, seu intellectualia 
quaecumque, n. 158, 265, 749, 915, 1007 ostensum est. </p>
