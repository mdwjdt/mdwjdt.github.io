<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7933节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7933.</strong>“按着应许”表照着圣言中的应许。这从“应许”的含义清楚可知，当主谈论那些属于属灵教会的人所要到的天堂时，“应许（即说）”（speaking）是指圣言中的应许。因为圣言的内义，无论摩西五经中的，还是先知书中的，论述了对那些在降临之前滞留在低地并被恶人侵扰之人的释放，以及他们被提入天堂。在这些书中，“以色列人”是指这些人。这种（释放的）应许就是此处“按着耶和华应许”这句话所表示的。<br />主在各处说，包含在圣经里的一切话都要在祂里面成就，并已经成就，祂说的是包含在圣言内义中的事；因为内义唯独论述主的国度，在至高意义上论述主自己。如在以下经文：<br />耶稣对门徒说，这就是我从前与你们同在之时所告诉你们的话：摩西的律法、先知的书和诗篇上所记的，凡指着我的话都必须应验。于是耶稣开他们的心窍，使他们能明白圣经。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.44.htm">24:44</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.45.htm">45</a>）<br /><br />看哪，我们上耶路撒冷去，先知指着人子所写的一切事都要成就。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路18.31.htm">18:31</a>）<br />马太福音：<br />莫想我来要废掉律法和先知；我来不是要废掉，乃是要成全。我实在告诉你们：就是到天地都废去了，律法的一点一画也不能废去，直到一切都成全。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.17.htm">5:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.18.htm">18</a>）<br />这些话，以及主在别处所说关于成全律法或圣言的话，如前所述，在内义上都涉及那些所预言关于祂的事。就内义而言，每一个细节，直到一点一画，都论述主。这就是为何祂说“律法的一点一画也不能废去，直到一切都成全”。路加福音：<br />天地废去较比律法的一点一画落空还容易。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路16.17.htm">16:17</a>）<br />人若不知道每一个细节，直到最小的细节，在内义上论述主及其国度，圣言因此是最神圣的，就不可能开始理解这一切是什么意思，即：“一点一画都不落空，一点一画也不能废去”、“天地废去落空还容易”。因来呈现在外在意义上的这些事似乎并不那么重要；但文本的连续性内在是这样的：没有一个音节是能省略的，否则，就会中断思维顺序。</p>

As He hath spoken. That this signifies according to the promise in the Word, is evident from the signification of "speaking," when said by the Lord about heaven, to which those were to come who were 
of the spiritual church, as being the promise in the Word. For the internal sense of the Word, both in the books of Moses and in the Prophets, treats of the liberation of those who before the Lord's coming 
had been detained in the lower earth and infested by the evil, and their elevation into heaven; and they are there meant by "the sons of Israel." This promise is what is here signified by the words 
"as Jehovah hath spoken." [2] The Lord's saying in various places that in Him are to be consummated and have been consummated all things contained in the Scriptures, involves what is contained in 
the internal sense of the Word, for this treats of the Lord's kingdom only, and in the supreme sense, of the Lord Himself, as in the following passages: </p>
<p>     Jesus said to the disciples, These are the 
words which I spoke unto you while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled which have been written in the law of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning Me. Then 
opened He their mind that they might understand the Scriptures (Luke 24:44-45).      Behold we go up to Jerusalem, where all things shall be accomplished that have been written by the prophets concerning 
the Son of man (Luke 18:31).      Think ye not that I came to destroy the law and the prophets: I came not to destroy, but to fulfil. Verily I say to you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one 
jot or one little horn shall in no wise pass away in the law, till all things be done (Matt. 5:17-18). [3] These things, and what the Lord says elsewhere about the fulfilling of the Law or the Scripture, 
involve in the internal sense, as said, those things which had been foretold about Him. In this sense, each and all things, down to every jot, or to every least point, treat of the Lord; and therefore 
it is said that "one jot or one little horn shall in no wise pass away in the law till all things be done." And in Luke: </p>
<p>     It is easier for heaven and earth to pass than for one point of the 
law to fail (Luke 16:17). He who does not know that all the details, down to the least of all, in the internal sense treat of the Lord and of His kingdom, and that from this the Word is most holy, 
cannot possibly comprehend what this means; that "not one point shall fail nor one jot or little horn pass away," and that "it is easier for heaven and earth to pass." For those things which stand forth 
in the external sense do not seem of such great moment; but the internal text contains so much that not even a syllable could be omitted without an interruption of the series. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7933</b></p><p><b>7933.</b>
'As He has spoken' means in accordance with the promise contained in the Word. This is clear from the meaning of 'speaking', when the Lord talks of heaven to which those belonging to the spiritual Church 
are to come, as the promise contained in the Word. For the internal sense of the Word, both in the Books of Moses and in the Prophets, deals with the deliverance of those who before the Lord's Coming 
were held back on the lower earth, where they were molested by the evil, and with their being raised into heaven. And these people are meant in those books by 'the children of Israel'. This promise 
[of deliverance] is what 'as Jehovah has spoken' means here.   </p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 When the Lord says in various places that all things in Scripture are to be or have been brought to completion in Him, He means 
the things contained in the internal sense of the Word; for that sense deals exclusively with the Lord's kingdom, and the highest sense with the Lord Himself. For example in Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said to the 
disciples, These are the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms concerning Me. 
Then He opened their minds, in order that they might understand the Scriptures. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2024:44,%2045&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 24:44, 45</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, we are going up into Jerusalem where all things will be accomplished 
that have been written by the prophets concerning the Son of Man. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2018:31&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 18:31</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Do not think that I came to destroy the Law and the Prophets; I did not come to destroy but to fulfill. 
Truly I say to you, Even until heaven and earth pass away, one lot or one little horn [on a letter] will not pass away in the Law till all things are done. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%205:17,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 5:17, 18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In these statements 
and in those which the Lord makes elsewhere about the fulfilment of the Law or Scripture He means, as has been stated, the things foretold about Himself in the internal sense. Every single detail 
in that sense, even to each jot or each smallest tittle, has to do with the Lord. This is why He says that 'one jot or one little horn will not pass away in the Law till all things are done'. And in Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
It 
is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one tittle of the Law to fall. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2016:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 16:17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone who does not know that every detail even to the smallest of all has to do in the internal 
sense with the Lord and His kingdom, and that for this reason the Word is most holy, cannot begin to understand what this may mean, that not one tittle will fall, that not one jot or little horn 
will pass away, and that it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away. For although the details that present themselves in the outward sense do not seem to be so important, the continuity of the text 
inwardly is such that not a part of a word could be left out without causing a break in the sequence of thought. </p>

`Quemadmodum locutus est': quod significet secundum promissionem in Verbo, constat ex significatione `loqui' cum dicitur a Domino de caelo ad quod venturi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, quod sit promissio 
in Verbo; in sensu enim interno Verbi, tam in Libris Moschis quam apud Prophetas, agitur de liberatione illorum qui ante Adventum Domini detenti fuerunt in terra inferiore, (c)ac infestati a malis, 
deque elevatione illorum in caelum, ac intellecti ibi sunt per `filios Israelis'; haec promissio est quae significatur hic per `quemadmodum locutus Jehovah.' 	2 Quod Dominus passim dicat quod in Ipso 
consummanda et consummata sint omnia quae in scriptura, involvunt illa quae in sensu interno Verbi sunt, nam ibi agitur unice de regno Domini, ac in supremo sensu de Ipso Domino; sicut quae apud Lucam, Jesus 
dixit discipulis: Haec sunt verba quae locutus sum ad vos, cum adhuc essem vobiscum, quod oporteret impleri omnia quae scripta sunt in Lege Moschis et Prophetis et Psalmis de Me; tunc aperuit 
eorum mentem, ut intelligerent scripturas, xxiv 44, 45: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Ecce ascendimus in Hierosolymam ubi perficientur omnia quae scripta sunt per Prophetas de Filio hominis, xviii 31: </p>
<p>et apud Matthaeum, Nolite 
putare quod venerim ad solvendum Legem et Prophetas; non veni ad solvendum sed ad implendum.  Amen dico vobis, Usque dum praetereat caelum et terra, iota unum aut unum {1}corniculum 
non praeteribit in Lege donec omnia fiant, {2} v 17, 18; </p>
<p>haec, et quae Dominus alibi dicit de impletione Legis seu Scripturae, 3 involvunt, ut dictum est, illa quae de Ipso in sensu interno praedicta 
sunt; in illo sensu omnia et singula usque ad {3}unumquodvis iota, {4}seu ad quemlibet minimum apicem, agunt de Domino; {5}quare dicitur quod `iota unum aut corniculum unum, non praeteribit in Lege donec 
omnia fiant': et apud Lucam, Facilius est caelum et terram transire quam Legis unum {1}apicem cadere, xvi 17; </p>
<p>qui non scit quod singula usque ad omnium minima in sensu interno de Domino et de Ipsius 
regno agant, et quod inde {6}Verbum sit sanctissimum, nequaquam comprehendere potest quid hoc, quod non unus apex cadet' nec `unum iota aut corniculum praeteribit' et quod `facilius sit ut caelum 
et terra transeat'; nam illa quae in sensu externo exstant {7}non apparent tanti; (m)textus autem internus tam continens est ut ne quidem vocula absque {8} interruptione seriei {9}omissa esse potuerit.(n) 	@1
