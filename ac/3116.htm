<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3116节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3116.</strong> 这三节论述了对于要被引入良善，并与其联结的真理的调查，主要调查它的起源。一切事物，无论总体还是细节，皆依赖于它的起源。衍生物通过它们的起源，如通过自己的根或种那样成形，这和一棵幼苗通过它的根或种成形是一样的道理。主通过神性看见，并调查祂所具有的这些真理，凭自己的智慧聪明引入它们，也就是说，将真理引入理性的良善。这调查本身就是此处内义所描述的。然而，我们只能极其简单地解释包含在内义中的这些事。<br />调查同样会发生在正被改造的每个人身上，以及接受余留的每个人身上。不过，人对这调查一无所知。对他来说，这调查完全笼罩在模糊中，以致他甚至不相信它的存在。而事实上，它每时每刻都在进行。唯独主看见人的状态，不仅看见他现在的状态，还看见他未来直到永恒的状态，祂就是进行调查的那一位。调查是一种极其微妙的平衡，以防止有丝毫的虚假与良善联结，有丝毫的真理与邪恶联结。倘若虚假真与良善联结，或真理与邪恶联结，人必永远灭亡。因为若是这种情况，那么他在来世会悬在地狱与天堂之间，由于良善而被地狱逐出，由于邪恶而被天堂逐出。</p>

These three verses treat of the exploration of the truth which is to be initiated and thus conjoined with good; and this indeed especially in regard to its origin, for on the origin depend all things 
in general and in particular; from it the derived things have their form, as from their root, or their seed, as a plant or a tree has from its root or seed. These truths the Lord saw and explored in 
Himself from the Divine, and from His own wisdom and intelligence initiated; that is to say He initiated truths into the good of the rational. The exploration itself is here described in the internal 
sense; but the things contained therein can be explained only very briefly. Exploration takes place likewise with every man who is being reformed, and also with everyone who receives remains; but of this 
exploration the man knows nothing at all; it is so entirely in obscurity with him that he does not even believe that there is any; when yet it is taking place every moment, but from the Lord, who 
alone sees man's state-not only his present state, but also his future state to eternity. The exploration is a most exquisite balancing, to prevent even the least of falsity from being conjoined with 
good, and the least of truth from being conjoined with evil; for if there should be such conjunction, the man would perish eternally; because then in the other life he would hang between hell and heaven; 
and by reason of the good he would be spewed out from hell, and by reason of the evil from heaven. </p>

These three verses deal with the investigation of truth that was to be introduced into good and so joined to it, in particular as regards its origin, for every single thing is dependent on its origin. 
Derivations take shape from their origin as their own root or seed in the way that a young plant does from its root or seed. These things residing with Him the Lord saw and investigated from the Divine, 
and from His own wisdom and intelligence introduced them, that is to say, introduced truths into the good of the rational. It is the investigation itself that is described in these verses in the 
internal sense; yet the things present in that sense can be explained to very few. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Investigation also takes place with everyone who is being reformed, also with anyone who receives remnants. But 
of this investigation man knows nothing at all. To him it is so shrouded in obscurity that he does not even believe that it exists, even though it is taking place moment by moment. The Lord however, 
who alone has sight of a person's state, not only as it is at present but also as it will be for ever, is the one who carries out that investigation. Investigation involves a very delicate balancing 
to prevent even the smallest amount of falsity being joined to good, or the least amount of truth to evil. If falsity were joined to good, or truth to evil, a person would perish for ever, for he would 
in that case be suspended in the next life between hell and heaven, ejected by hell on account of good, and by heaven on account of evil. </p>

</p><b>3116.</b>
In his tribus versibus agitur de exploratione veri quod initiandum et sic conjungendum bono, et quidem imprimis ex qua origine [esset], nam ab origine omnia et singula dependent; derivationes inde ut 
e radice sua, seu ut e semine suo, trahunt suam formam, sicut a suis planta aut arbor: haec Dominus apud Se ex Divino vidit et exploravit, et ex propria sapientia et intelligentia initiavit, {1}nempe 
vera bono rationalis; ipsa exploratio hic in sensu interno describitur, sed quae ibi, paucissimis explicari possunt: [2] exploratio quoque est apud unumquemvis hominem qui reformatur, tum qui {2}reliquias 
accipit, sed de exploratione illa homo ne hilum novit, est ei ita in obscuro ut ne quidem credat quod sit, cum tamen omnibus momentis fit, sed a {3}Domino, Qui solus videt statum hominis, non modo 
praesentem, sed etiam faturum in aeternum.  (m)Exploratio est exquisitissima libratio ne minimum falsi conjungatur bono, nec minimum veri conjungatur malo; si haec, periret homo in aeternum; penderet 
enim tunc in altera vita inter infernum et caelum, et propter bonum exspueretur ab inferno, et propter malum a caelo. @1 et conjunxit$ @2 i aliquas$ @3 i solo$ </p>
