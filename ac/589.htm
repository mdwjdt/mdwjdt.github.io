<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>589.</strong>这些以及很多其它经文清楚表明，圣言是照着适合人的表象说的。因此，无论是谁，只要他想通过圣言照之所说的表象证实虚假的设想，都能引用无数经文证实它。然而，通过圣言证实虚假的设想是一回事，简单相信圣言则是另外一回事。凡证实虚假设想的人首先会接受一个设想，然后拒绝从中退出，或一点也不想撤回，反而竭尽所能四处搜罗证据，甚至不惜引用圣言，直到最后自我说服，致使他再也无法看见真理。然而，简单相信，或心思单纯者则没有先见为主的设想，反而会思考，因为主是这么说的，所以它就是真理。如果用圣言的其它说法教导他如何理解这个问题，他内心会默许，欢喜接受。所以，简单相信主发怒、惩罚、后悔和忧伤的人，由于这种信念也会畏惧邪恶，行出良善，不会受到伤害；因为这种信仰使他相信主看见一切；若处于这样一种信仰，随后他也会在信的其它问题上获得启示，即便不是现在，也会在来生（灵界）。那些受我欲或物欲驱使之人则迥然不同，他们自我说服，深信从先入为主的设想得出的东西。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]589.</strong> These and many other passages in the Word show that it speaks according to human appearances. Anyone who wants to use the appearances in which the statements of the Word are couched to support false premises will have an unlimited supply to choose from.<br />But using the Word to prove false assumptions is very different from taking the Word at face value. Those who confirm false assumptions start by seizing on a principle that they refuse ever to relinquish or even partially to retract. Instead they scrape together and pile up proofs from every available source, including the Word, until they have so thoroughly convinced themselves of their premise that they can no longer see the truth.<br />[2] Those who take the Word at face value, however, or who believe it with a simple heart, do not start by taking hold of a principle but think, "Since the Lord said it, it is true." And if they are taught how to understand it, by the use of other passages from the Word, they yield to it with joy in their hearts.<br />It does no harm to believe in all simplicity that the Lord is angry, punishes, relents, or grieves and that we should accordingly fear evil and do good, because it leads to the belief that the Lord sees everything large and small. Once committed to this belief, we receive enlightenment in all other areas — during the next life, if not before. The case is very different with those who delude themselves with their cherished assumptions, helped along by vile self-love and greed. </p>

From these and many other passages it is evident that the Word was spoken according to the appearances with man. Whoever therefore desires to confirm false principles by the appearances according to 
which the Word was spoken, can do so by passages without number. But it is one thing to confirm false principles by the Word, and another to believe in simplicity what is in the Word. He who confirms 
false principles, first assumes a principle which he will not at all recede from, nor in the least yield, but scrapes together and accumulates confirmations wherever he can, thus also from the Word, until 
he so strongly persuades himself that he can no longer see the truth. But he who simply or with simple heart believes, does not first assume principles, but thinks that because the Lord has thus 
said it is true; and if instructed from other sayings of the Word how it is to be understood, he acquiesces and rejoices in his heart. Even the man who in simplicity believes that the Lord is angry, punishes, 
repents, and grieves, and so believing is afraid of evil and does good, takes no harm; for this belief causes him to believe also that the Lord sees everything; and being in such a belief he 
is afterwards enlightened in other matters of faith, if not before, then in the other life. Very different is the case with those who in agreement with a foul love of self or of the world persuade themselves 
to believe certain things that are deduced from the principles they have already adopted. </p>

These and so many other places in the Word make it clear that the manner of speaking is in accordance with the outward appearances that are proper to man. Consequently anyone who wishes to confirm false 
assumptions from the outward appearances according to which the Word speaks could do so from countless places. Confirming false assumptions from the Word is one thing however, believing in simplicity 
what the Word contains is quite another. Anybody confirming false assumptions first of all adopts an assumption and then refuses to withdraw from it or to retract the smallest detail. Instead he scrapes 
together and piles up confirmatory material wherever he can, doing so even from the Word, till at length his self-persuasion renders him incapable any more of seeing the truth. Anybody however 
who believes in simplicity, or simple-heartedly, has no preconceived assumptions. Instead he thinks that because the Lord has said it, it is the truth. And if he is shown by means of other statements 
in the Word how the matter is to be understood, there and then he assents to it and in his heart rejoices. The person therefore who believes in simplicity that the Lord is angry, punishes, repents, and 
grieves, and in so believing fears evil and does what is good, comes to no harm. For by believing all this of the Lord he also believes that the Lord sees every single thing. And that being his faith, 
he is after that enlightened in all other matters of faith, in the next life if not already in this. It is quite different in the case of people who, prompted by filthy self-love or by love of the 
world, persuade themselves of what results from preconceived assumptions.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 589</b>
</p><b>589.</b>
Ex his et perplurimis aliis locis Verbi constare potest quod secundum apparentias apud hominem locutum sit, quare qui ex apparentiis, secundum quas locutum in Verbo, velit confirmare principia falsa, 
is posset ex innumerabilibus: sed aliud est confirmare principia falsa ex Verbo, et aliud est credere simpliciter quae in Verbo; qui confirmat principia falsa, is prius capit principium a quo nusquam 
vult recedere aut minimum remittere, sed corradit et cumulat confirmantia ubicumque potest, ita quoque ex Verbo, usque dum ita sibi persuadet ut non amplius possit videre verum. At qui simpliciter aut 
ex simplici corde credit, is non capit principia prius, sed cogitat, quia Dominus ita locutus, quod verum sit; et si instruitur quomodo intelligendum, ex aliis dictis Verbi, tunc acquiescit, et corde 
suo gaudet: immo qui ex simplicitate credit quod Dominus irascatur, puniat, paeniteat, doleat, et homo sic timeat a malo et faciat bonum, ei nihil nocet; sic etenim etiam credit quod Dominus videat 
omnia et singula, et cum in tali fide est, in ceteris dein, si non prius, in altera vita illustratur; secus ac ii qui ex captis principiis sibi persuadent, conspirante amore foedo sui aut mundi. </p>
