<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1015.</strong>“繁殖增多”表内层人中良善与真理的增加，“繁殖”涉及良善，“增多”涉及真理。这从前面有关本章第一节的说明清楚可知，那里出现了同样的词。这种增加出现于内在人，这一点从下文明显可知，那里经上又说“增多”，如果它不是指某种特别的、不同于前文的东西，那么这种重复是没有必要的，因而是多余的。由此及前文明显可知，繁殖增多在此涉及内在人中的良善与真理。经上提及“内层人”，是因为就象前面说的，就属天属灵之物，即唯独属于主之物而言，人才是内在人；就理性之物而言，他是内层人或中间人，介于内在人与外在人之间；就对良善的情感和记忆的知识而言，他是外在人。<br />本章开篇的介绍（<a href="978.htm">978</a>节）已说明，这就是人的本性。人活在肉身时对这一切一无所知，因为他沉浸在身体事物中。因此，他甚至不知道内层事物的存在，更不知道它们被置于截然不同而又分离的秩序中。然而，当他将思维从身体当中抽离出来，仿佛在灵里思考时，他若愿意深思，它们的存在对他来说是显而易见的。繁殖和增多涉及内层人，即理性人的原因在于，内在人的活动只能以非常笼统的方式在内层人中被感觉到。因为无限必不可少的细节在内层人中呈现为一个整体，事实上是极其笼统的整体。从前面的论述（<a href="545.htm">545</a>节）清楚可知，这些细节何等数不胜数，以及它们如何相互关联，并呈现为一个模糊、极其笼统的整体。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1015.</strong> The fact that reproduce and multiply symbolizes increasing goodness and truth in our intermediate self, and that reproducing has to do with goodness, and multiplying with truth, can be seen from explanations above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1015/bible_king-james-version_genesis_9_1" target=_top>1</a> of this chapter [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1015/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_983" target=_top>983</a>], which uses the same words.<br />Evidence that the increase takes place in the intermediate self is provided by the next clause, which repeats the word multiply. Redundancy would make the second instance pointless if it did not have its own meaning — a meaning different from that of the first. From this and other statements made along the way it stands to reason that the reproducing and multiplying have to do with goodness and truth in our intermediate self.<br />The term "intermediate self" is used because the heavenly and spiritual traits in us, which belong to the Lord alone, supply us with an internal self, as shown earlier. Our rational processes, on the other hand, supply us with an intermediate self, or one midway between internal and external. And our responses to goodness, and the facts in our memory, create an external self for us.<br />[2] Section 978 in the remarks introducing this chapter shows that we have these levels, but the reason we are unaware of it while living in our bodies is that we are absorbed by bodily interests. As a consequence we do not even recognize the existence of deeper elements, let alone the fact that they are arranged into these distinct layers. If we are willing to reflect on it, though, we can see it clearly enough by drawing our thoughts up out of our body and thinking in our spirit, so to speak.<br />The reason that reproducing and multiplying have to do with the intermediate self — the rational self — is that we do not feel the operation of the internal self except in a very general way, at that intermediate level. A single general impression or even a comprehensive general impression is created in our intermediate self by a boundless number of individual components. Just how far beyond counting they are, what they are like, and how they create a dim, general impression can be seen from the demonstration offered earlier at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1015/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_545" target=_top>545</a>. </p>

Be ye fruitful and multiply. That this signifies increase of good and truth in the interior man, and that "to be fruitful" is predicated of goods, and "to multiply" of truths, is evident from what has 
been shown before at the first verse of this chapter, where the same words occur. That the increase is in the interior man, is evident from what follows, where it is said again "be ye multiplied" which 
repetition would be needless, because superfluous, if it did not signify something special, distinct from what goes before. From this and from what was said above it is evident that being fruitful 
and multiplying are here predicated of goods and truths in the interior man. It is said the interior man because, as was shown above, in respect to what is celestial and spiritual, which is of the Lord 
alone, man is an internal man; but as to what is rational he is an interior or middle man, intermediate between the internal man and the external; and in respect to the affections of good and knowledges 
of the memory he is an external man. That such is the nature of man has been shown in what is premised to this chapter (n. 978); but his not knowing it while he lives in the body is because he is 
in the things of the body, and hence does not even know that there are interior things, still less that they are set in this distinct and separate order. Yet on reflecting the fact will be quite evident 
to him, when he is in thought withdrawn from the body and is thinking as it were in his spirit. The reason fruitfulness and multiplication are predicated of the interior or rational man is that the 
working of the internal man is not perceived, except in the interior man in a very general manner. For in the interior man an innumerable host of particulars are presented to view as one general thing; 
most extremely general in fact. How innumerable the particulars are, what is their nature, and how they present an obscure general whole, is evident from what has been shown above (n. 545). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1015</b></p><p><b>1015.</b>
That 'be fruitful and multiply' means increases in good and truth in the interior man, 'being fruitful' having reference to goods and multiplying' to truths, is clear from what has been shown already 
at verse 1 of this chapter where the same words occur. That they reside with the interior man becomes clear from the second half of this verse where the imperative multiply is repeated. This would be 
an unnecessary and therefore pointless repetition if it did not mean something specific, different from the previous use of the word. From these considerations, and from others mentioned so far, it is 
clear that here being fruitful and multiplying have reference to goods and truths residing with the interior man. The expression 'interior man' is used because, as shown above, one is an internal man 
in regard to celestial and spiritual things which are the Lord' s alone, but an interior or intermediate man between internal man and external in regard to rational things, and an external man in regard 
to affections for good and to memory knowledge.  </p>

 That man is such has been shown in the opening sections of this chapter, in <a href="978.htm">978</a>, but the reason why the individual is not conscious of them 
during his life in the body is that he is immersed in bodily things. Therefore he does not know of the existence of interior things, let alone about their existing distinctly and separately in such order. 
Yet, if he is willing to reflect, their existence is evident to him when he is wrapped in thought detached from the body and is thinking so to speak within his spirit. The reason being fruitful 
and multiplying have reference to the interior man, which is the rational, is that the activity of the internal man is not felt except very generally in the interior man, for limitless integral parts 
manifest themselves in the interior as one general, indeed very general, whole. How limitless those integral parts are, how they interrelate and manifest themselves as an obscure and very general whole, 
becomes clear from what has been shown already in <a href="545.htm">545</a>. </p>

Quod 'fructificamini et multiplicamini' significent incrementa boni et veri in interiore homine, et quod 'fructificari' praedicetur de bonis et 'multiplicari' de veris, constat ab illis quae ostensa 
sunt prius ad vers. 1 hujus capitis ubi eadem verba: quod haec apud interiorem hominem, constare potest ab illis quae sequuntur ubi iterum dicitur multiplicamini, quae repetitio supervacanea foret quia 
superflua, si non aliquid peculiare distinctum a priore significaretur; ex quibus, et ab illis quae hactenus dicta sunt, constat quod hic fructificatio et multiplicatio praedicetur de bonis et veris 
apud terrorem hominem.  Interior homo dicitur quia, ut supra ostensum, homo quoad caelestia et spiritualia quae solius Domini sunt, est internus homo; at quoad rationalia est interior seu medius inter 
internum et externum; et quoad affectiones boni et quoad scientifica memoriae est externus; [2] quod talis homo sit, ostensum est in praemissis hujus capitis n. 978, sed quod hoc nesciat cum in corpore 
vivit, est quia in corporeis est; inde ne quidem novit quod interiora sint, minus quod ita ordine distincta sint; at si velit reflectere, satis ei constare potest cum in cogitatione abstracta est 
a corpore et quasi in spiritu suo cogitat.  Quod fructificatio et multiplicatio praedicetur de interiore homine seu de rationali, causa est quia operatio interni hominis non sentitur nisi communissime 
in interiore, nam indefinita singularia sunt quae sistunt unum quoddam commune, et quidem communissimum in ejus interiore homine; quae singularia quam indefinita sunt et quomodo se habent et sistunt 
communissimum quoddam obscurum, constare potest ab illis quae ostensa prius n. 545. </p>
