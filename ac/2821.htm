<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2821节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2821.</strong>“耶和华的使者从天上呼叫他”表那时从神性本身所得的安慰。这从“从天上呼叫”和“耶和华的使者”的含义清楚可知，“从天上呼叫”是指给予安慰，这也可从前后文明显看出来。在圣言中，当提及使者或天使时，他们表主里面的某种事物，准确地说，表属于主的东西，这从整个思路明显可知（参看<a href="1925.htm">1925</a>节）。此处“耶和华的使者”表示神性本身。当主在客西马尼园经受最严厉的试探时，我们同样读到关于主的类似经文：<br />有一位天使从天上向祂显现，加添祂的力量。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.43.htm">22:43</a>）<br />此处“天上的天使”在内义上也表示主里面的神性。</p>

The angel of Jehovah called unto him out of heaven. That this signifies consolation from the Divine Itself at that time, is evident from the signification of "calling out of heaven," as being to console; 
as is also manifest from what immediately precedes and what next follows; and also from the signification of the "angel of Jehovah." (That when angels are mentioned in the Word, by them is meant 
something in the Lord, and that it appears from the series what of the Lord is meant, may be seen above, n. 1925.) We read in like manner concerning the Lord, that when He sustained the most grievous 
temptation in Gethsemane, an angel from heaven was seen by Him strengthening Him (Luke 22:43). By the "angel from heaven" here also in the internal sense is meant the Divine which was in Him. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2821</b></p><p><b>2821.</b>
'The angel of Jehovah called to him out of heaven' means comfort received at that time from the Divine itself. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'calling out of heaven' as giving comfort to, as 
is also evident from what comes immediately before and directly after; and from the meaning of 'the angel of Jehovah'. When angels are mentioned in the Word they mean something within the Lord, though 
exactly what belonging to Him is apparent from the whole train of thought, see <a href="1925.htm">1925</a>. Here 'the angel of Jehovah' is used to mean the Divine itself. Something similar is said regarding the Lord, when 
He endured the very severe temptation in Gethsemane, </p>
<blockquote>
There appeared to Him an angel from heaven, strengthening Him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2022:-43&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 22:-43</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'an angel from heaven' is used in the internal sense to 
mean the Divine that was within Him. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2821</b>
</p><b>2821.</b>
`Clamavit ad eum angelus Jehovae e caelo': quod significet consolationem ex Ipso Divino tunc, constare potest ex significatione `clamare e caelo' quod sit consolari, ut quoque patet ab illis quae proxime 
praecedunt et quae mox sequuntur; et ex significatione `angeli Jehovae' cum angeli in Verbo nominantur, quod per eos intelligatur aliquid in Domino, sed quid Domini, quod appareat ex serie, `videatur' 
n. 1925: hic intelligitur Ipsum Divinum.  Similiter legitur de Domino, cum tentationem gravissimam sustinuit in Gethsemane, quod           Visus sit Ipsi angelus de caelo confortans Ipsum, Luc. xxii 
43; per `angelum e caelo' ibi in sensu interno etiam intelligitur Divinum quod in Ipso.       </p>
