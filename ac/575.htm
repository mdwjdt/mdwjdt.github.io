<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第575节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>575.</strong>“他的日子还可到一百二十年”表人当有信的余留。前几节（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创5.3.htm">5:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创5.4.htm">4</a>）说明了“日子”和“年”表时间和状态，上古之人表教会状态和状态的变化，这些状态及其变化用各种不同的数字来估算，但这种准确估算教会事物的天性如今已完全丧失了。同样，没人能理解这里出现的年数的意义，除非知道隐藏在1到12等每个数字里面的含义。这清楚表明，它们象征某种奥秘或其它东西，因为“人的日子还可到一百二十年”这句经文与前面的自相矛盾。他们也不是真的活到一百二十年，这一点从第11章有关大洪水后之人的说明清楚看出来，即闪生亚法撒之后，又活了500年，亚法撒生沙拉之后，又活了403年，沙拉生希伯之后，也活了403年，希伯生法勒之后，又活了430年。创世记9章28节说到，洪水以后，挪亚又活了350等等。然而，数字120所象征的意义仅从10和12这两个数字就能清楚看出来，因为120就是10乘12，它表示信的余留。在圣言中，数字十和十分之一均象征和代表被主保存于内在人中的余留。由于这些余留唯独属于主，所以它们是神圣的。数字12表示信，即完全属于信的所有事物。所以120这个复合数表信的余留。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]575.</strong> The days of humankind will be one hundred twenty years means that they ought to have traces of faith left. In verses <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_575/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_3" target=_top>3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_575/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_4" target=_top>4</a> of the last chapter I said that days and years symbolize those times and states [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_575/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_482" target=_top>482</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_575/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_487" target=_top>487-488</a>], and that the earliest people used different combinations of numbers to symbolize the state of the church and changes in that state [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_575/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_487#subsection-2-2" target=_top>487:2</a>]. But their method of calculating numbers for the affairs of their church is part of the knowledge that has been lost.<br />Likewise in the present verse the number of years comes up, and no one can have any idea what the numbers mean without knowing what significance lies hidden in the individual numbers from one to twelve and beyond. It is obvious that they involve some other, hidden meaning, since a life span of 120 years is inconsistent with earlier verses. People in later times did not live a mere 120 years either, as can be seen from those living after the Flood. Chapter <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_575/bible_king-james-version_genesis_11_1-32" target=_top>11</a> says of Shem that he lived 500 years after fathering Arpachshad, that Arpachshad lived 403 years after fathering Shelah, that Shelah also lived 403 years after fathering Eber, and that Eber lived 430 years after fathering Peleg. Chapter 9, verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_575/bible_king-james-version_genesis_9_28" target=_top>28</a>, says that Noah lived 350 years after the Flood. And so on.<br />What the number 120 involves can be seen only from its factors, ten and twelve. To be specific, it symbolizes remaining traces of faith. In the Word the number ten — and tenths or tithes as well — symbolizes and represents a remnant preserved by the Lord in the inner self, the remnant being holy because it belongs to the Lord alone. The number twelve symbolizes faith, or all aspects of faith taken as a whole. The number compounded out of these symbolizes a remnant of faith. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 575</b></p><p><b>575.</b>
That by the days of man being a hundred and twenty years is signified that he ought to have remains of faith, appears from what has been said in the foregoing chapter (Gen. 5:3-4), concerning "days" 
and "years" signifying times and states; and also from the circumstance of the most ancient people from numbers variously compounded signifying states and changes of states in the church; but the nature 
of their ecclesiastical computation is now totally lost. Here in like manner numbers of years are mentioned, whose signification it is impossible for anyone to understand, unless he be first acquainted 
with the hidden meaning of each particular number from "one" to "twelve" and so on. It plainly appears that they contain within them something else that is secret, for that men were to live a "hundred 
and twenty years" has no connection with the preceding part of the verse, nor did they live one hundred and twenty years, as is evident from the people after the flood (chapter 11), where it is 
said of Shem that "he lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years;" and that Arphaxad lived after be begat Selah "four hundred and three years;" and that Selah lived after he begat Eber "four hundred 
and three years;" and that Eber lived after he begat Peleg "four hundred and thirty years;" and that Noah lived after the flood "three hundred and fifty years" (Gen. 9:28), and so on. But what is 
involved in the number "one hundred and twenty" appears only from the meaning of "ten" and "twelve" which being multiplied together make one hundred and twenty, and from the signification of these component 
numbers it may be seen that "one hundred and twenty" signifies the remains of faith. The number "ten" in the Word, as also "tenths" signify and represent remains, which are preserved by the Lord 
in the internal man, and which are holy, because they are of the Lord alone; and the number "twelve" signifies faith, or all things relating to faith in one complex; the number therefore that is compounded 
of these, signifies the remains of faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 575</b></p><p><b>575.</b>
'The days of man were to be a hundred and twenty years' means that he ought to have remnants of faith. At verses 3 and <a href="4.htm">4</a> of the previous chapter it was stated that 'days' and 'years' meant periods of 
time and states, and that the most ancient people meant states and changes in the states of the Church by the numbers which they compounded variously. The exact nature of their computation of things 
that had to do with the Church is one of those matters that have been lost. Here in like manner numbers of years occur, whose meaning nobody can possibly know unless he knows what is concealed in each 
of the numbers <a href="1.htm">1</a> to <a href="12.htm">12</a>, and so on. It is quite apparent that they embody some arcanum or other, for in saying that they would live a hundred and twenty years this verse contradicts those that go before 
it. Nor subsequently did they live a mere hundred and twenty years, as is clear from what Chapter <a href="11.htm">11</a> says about those who lived after the Flood - that Shem lived <a href="500.htm">500</a> years after he beget Arpachshad, 
Arpachshad <a href="407.htm">407</a> years after he beget Shelah, Shelah <a href="403.htm">403</a> years as well after he beget Eber, and Eber <a href="430.htm">430</a> years after he beget Peleg. Chapter 9:28 says that Noah lived <a href="350.htm">350</a> years after the Flood; and other 
examples could be given. What the number <a href="120.htm">120</a> embodies however is clear merely from the numbers to and <a href="12.htm">12</a>, for <a href="120.htm">120</a> is the product of <a href="10.htm">10</a> times <a href="12.htm">12</a>. It means remnants of faith. In the Word the number 
ten has the same meaning as tenths, representing remnants which are preserved by the Lord within the internal man. And since these are the Lord's alone they are holy. The number twelve means faith, that 
is, all things belonging to faith in their entirety. So this composite number means remnants of faith.  </p>

</p><b>575.</b>
Quod 'dies hominis essent centum et viginti anni' significent quod reliquiae fidei ei esse debeant: in cap. praec. ad vers. 3 et 4 dictum quod 'dies et anni' significent tempora et status: et quod antiquissimi 
per numeros varie compositos significaverint status et mutationes statuum Ecclesiae; sed qualis eorum ecclesiasticorum computus fuerit, inter res perditas est.  Hic similiter occurrunt numeri 
annorum, quos nusquam aliquis scire potest quid significant, nisi quid in numeris singulis ab 1 ad 12 et sic porro latet, sciatur: manifeste apparet quod aliud quid et arcanum involvant, nam quod 
'victuri centum et viginti annos' cum praecedentibus versus non cohaeret; nec vixerunt postea 120 annos, ut constat de illis qui post diluvium vixerunt, cap. xi, de Shemo, quod vixerit postquam genuit 
Arpachshad 500 annos; Arpachshad postquam genuit Shelah, 403 annos; Shelah postquam genuit Eberum pariter 403 annos: Eberus postquam genuit Pelegum 430 annos: Noahus post diluvium 350 annos, cap. {x}ix 
28, et sic porro. Quid autem numerus 120 involvit, constat solum ex 10 et 12, ex quibus multiplicatis compositus est; nempe quod significet reliquias fidei; numerus 'decem' in Verbo sicut etiam 'decimae' 
significant et repraesentant reliquias quae in interno homine conservatae a Domino, quae sanctae quia solius Domini; numerus 'duodecim' significat fidem seu omnia quae sunt fidei in uno complexu; 
ex illis nunc compositus numerus significat reliquias fidei. </p>
