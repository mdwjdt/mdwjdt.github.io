<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6857节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6857.</strong>“流奶与蜜”表它们是喜悦和快乐的源头。这从“奶”和“蜜”的含义清楚可知：“奶”是指属天-属灵层，或良善之真理（参看<a href="2184.htm">2184</a>节），它因表示良善之真理，故也表示这良善之真理的喜悦，因为这二者是联结在一起的；“蜜”是指快乐（<a href="5620.htm">5620</a>节）。从前面的说明（<a href="6854.htm">6854</a>节）可以看出“从那地上来，到美好宽阔之地，流奶与蜜之地”表示什么，即：那些被困在低地的坑里，直等到主来的人那时要被提升到作为喜悦和快乐源头的仁之良善和信之真理所在的天堂。这些事具体由这些话来表示；但总体由所有属于属灵教会，经历试探，并从中被解救出来的人来表示。</p>

Flowing with milk and honey. That this signifies the pleasantness and delight thence, is evident from the signification of "milk," as being the celestial spiritual, or the truth of good (see n. 2184); 
and as it denotes the truth of good, it denotes also the pleasantness thereof, for these are conjoined; and from the signification of "honey," as being delight (n. 5620). From what was shown above (n. 
6854) it can be seen what is meant by "making to come up out of that land to a land good and broad, flowing with milk and honey," namely, that they who had been detained in the lower earth in pits 
there until the Lord's coming, should then be raised to heaven where are the good of charity and the truth of faith and the derivative pleasantness and delight. These things are specifically signified 
by these words; but in general are signified all of the spiritual church who are in temptation and are liberated from it. </p>

'Flowing with milk and honey' means which are a source of pleasure and delight. This is clear from the meaning of milk' as the celestial-spiritual or the truth of good, dealt with in <a href="2184.htm">2184</a>, and being 
the truth of good it is also the pleasure that goes with it, for the two are joined together; and from the meaning of honey' as delight, dealt with in <a href="5620.htm">5620</a>. From what was shown above in <a href="6854.htm">6854</a> one may see 
what causing to go up out of that land to a land good and broad, flowing with milk and honey' is used to mean - that those who were held back on the lower earth, in pits there, until the Lord's Coming 
would be raised up to heaven, where the good of charity and the truth of faith are, which are a source of pleasure and delight. These things are what are meant in particular by those words; but in 
general they mean that all belonging to the spiritual Church undergo temptation and are delivered from it. </p>

`Fluentem lacte et melle': quod significet et inde amoenum et jucundum, constat ex significatione `lactis' quod sit caeleste spirituale seu verum boni, de qua n. 2184; et quia est verum boni, est quoque 
amoenum ejus, conjuncta enim sunt; et ex significatione `mellis' quod sit jucundum, de qua n. 5620.  Ex illis quae supra n. 6854 ostensa sunt, constare potest (x)quid intelligitur per `{1}facere 
ascendere e terra illa ad terram bonam et latam, fluentem lacte et melle,' quod nempe illi qui in terra inferiore in foveis ibi usque ad Adventum Domini detenti fuerunt elevarentur tunc ad caelum, ubi 
bonum charitatis et verum fidei, et inde amoenum et jucundum.  Haec in specie significantur per illa verba; in genere autem omnes qui e spirituali Ecclesia in tentatione sunt, (c)et inde liberantur. 	@1
