Verses 9-14. And these are the births of Esau the father of Edom in Mount Seir: these are the names of the sons of Esau; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau; Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of 
Esau. And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz. And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz the son of Esau; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek; these are the sons of Adah Esau's wife. 
And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath and Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah: these were the sons of Basemath Esau's wife. And these were the sons of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, 
Esau's wife; and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah. "And these are the births of Esau the father of Edom," signifies the derivations in Divine good natural ("the father of Edom" is the Divine 
good from which the others are derived); "in Mount Seir," signifies as to the truths of good; "these are the names of the sons of Esau," signifies the quality of the derivations; "Eliphaz the son 
of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau," signifies the states of these derivations from the marriage of good and truth; "and the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, 
and Gatam, and Kenaz," signifies the first derivation of good; "and Timna was concubine to Eliphaz the son of Esau," signifies things that serve them; "and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek," signifies what 
is sensuous; "these are the sons of Adah Esau's wife," signifies a second derivation; "and these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath and Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah; these were the sons of Basemath Esau's wife," 
signifies a third derivation; "and these were the sons of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife; and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah," signifies a subsequent 
derivation. </p>
