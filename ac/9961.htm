<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9961.</strong>“裤子当从腰达到大腿”表构成这外层的事物的延伸范围，或说婚姻之爱的外层事物的延伸范围，这些事物由“亚麻布裤子”来表示。这从“腰”和“大腿”的含义清楚可知。“腰”和“大腿”是指构成婚姻之爱的事物，“腰”是指属于其内层的事物，“大腿”是指属于其外层的事物；因此所表示的是这爱从内层到外层的延伸。“腰”之所以表示这爱的内层事物，是因为它们在上面；“大腿”之所以表示它的外层事物，是因为它们在下面。一个人上面的部位表示内层事物，下面的部位表示外层事物；这就是为何在圣言中，高层事物表示内层事物，低层事物表示外层事物（参看<a href="3084.htm">3084</a>，<a href="4599.htm">4599</a>，<a href="5146.htm">5146</a>，<a href="8325.htm">8325</a>节）。一个人的较高部位对应于属天和属灵事物，也就是内层；较低部位对应于属世事物，也就是外层。这就是为何“脚”表示属世事物（<a href="2162.htm">2162</a>，<a href="3147.htm">3147</a>，<a href="3986.htm">3986</a>，<a href="4382.htm">4382</a>，<a href="4938.htm">4938</a>-<a href="4952.htm">4952</a>节）。“大腿”因是指朝向脚的腰部较低部位，故表示婚姻之爱的外层或低层（<a href="4277.htm">4277</a>，<a href="4280.htm">4280</a>节）。<br />然而，“腰”一般表示婚姻之爱（参看<a href="3021.htm">3021</a>，<a href="3294.htm">3294</a>，<a href="4575.htm">4575</a>，<a href="5050.htm">5050</a>-<a href="5062.htm">5062</a>节）；“腰”具有这种含义凭的是它们的对应关系。关于人的一切与天堂的对应关系，可参看9276 e，9280节提到的地方所作的大量说明。之所以说“婚姻之爱从内层到外层的延伸范围”，是因为爱的一切和信的一切，或也可说良善的一切和真理的一切在天堂有一个广泛的延伸范围；事实上，那里的所有人都照着信之真理和爱之良善之间的相似程度而结合在一起。每层天堂都有这样一个延伸范围。不过，每层天堂的延伸范围也延伸到下面的天堂，因为所有天堂都构成一体。事实上，它们向一直延伸到人类，以便人类同样能与天堂构成一体。这种延伸范围就是“从高层或内层延伸到低层或外层的范围”所表示的。高层或内层被称为属天和属灵的，而低层或外层被称为属世的，或世俗的。<br />关于婚姻之爱的具体情况，它的延伸范围是此处所描述的主题，这爱是一切爱的基础，它是从天堂里的良善与真理的婚姻那里降下来的。由于良善与真理的婚姻存在于天堂中，并构成天堂，所以真正的婚姻之爱构成与人同在的天堂本身。但天堂里的良善与真理的婚姻是从主与天堂的结合那里降下来的；因为从主发出并流入天堂的，是爱之良善；在那里被天使接受的，是源于这良善的真理，因而是源于良善，或有良善在其中的真理。这就是为何在圣言中，主被称为“新郎”和“丈夫”，天堂与教会被称为“新妇”和“妻子”。<br />这一切清楚表明婚姻在天堂何等神圣，奸淫在天堂何等亵渎。因为婚姻本身如此神圣，以至于再没有比这更神圣的了；如此神圣还有一个原因是，它们是人类的苗床，而人类是天堂的苗床，因为凡在世上过着天使般的生活之人都会去那里。另一方面，奸淫如此亵渎，以至于再没有比这更亵渎的了，因为它们毁灭与一个人同在的天堂和教会。关于这一事实，可参看前面（<a href="2727.htm">2727</a>-<a href="2759.htm">2759</a>节）关于婚姻和奸淫的阐述和说明。<br />这一切再次清楚表明为何前面（<a href="9960.htm">9960</a>节）所说的各种“裸露”表示污秽和地狱的事物；又为何经上说如此严厉地命令亚伦和他儿子在供职的时候要穿上裤子遮掩腰部，否则他们就会死亡；因为经上说：“要给他们作亚麻布裤子，遮掩裸露的皮肉，裤子当从腰达到大腿。当进入会幕，或就近坛，在圣所供职的时候，它们要在亚伦和他儿子身上，免得担当罪孽而死。这要为亚伦和他以后的种作一个时代的律例”。<br />因此，要知道，婚姻之爱是指一切属天和属灵之爱，因为真正的婚姻之爱是一切爱的基础，如前所示。故那些处于这爱的人也处于属于天堂和教会的其它一切爱；因为如前所述，它是从天堂里的良善与真理的婚姻那里降下来的，这婚姻构成天堂。这也解释了为何在圣言中，天堂被比作一个婚姻，也确实被称为一个婚姻。由此也明显可知为何要给予警告，或采取预防措施，以防止亚伦和他儿子在供职的时候裸露被看见；因为他们的裸露表示违背天堂之爱的一切爱，这些爱当作为目的时，一般被称为自我之爱和尘世之爱，是污秽和地狱的爱。今天的人们不知道这一切的确如此，因为他们充满这些爱，只以它们所产生的东西为乐。正因如此，当提到属灵之爱和属天之爱时，他们就感到困惑，不知道它们为何物，因而不知道天堂为何物；说不定当听到并思想脱离自我之爱和尘世之爱的属灵和属天之爱含有无法形容的永恒幸福在里面时，他们还会大为吃惊。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9961</b></p><p><b>9961.</b>
From the loins even unto the thighs they shall be. That this signifies the extension of the exterior things of conjugial love, which are signified by "the linen breeches," is evident from the signification 
of "the loins," and "the thighs," as being the things that belong to conjugial love; "the loins," those which belong to its interiors; and "the thighs," those which belong to its exteriors; thus 
its extension from interiors to exteriors. That "the loins" signify the interior things of this love, is because they are above; and that "the thighs" signify its exterior things, is because they are 
below; for the things with man which are above signify interior things, and those which are below signify exterior things. From this it is that in the Word interior things are meant by higher, and exterior 
by lower things (see n. 3084, 4599, 5146, 8325). With man the higher things correspond to celestial and spiritual things, which are interior; and the lower things correspond to natural things, 
which are exterior.  It is from this that "the feet" signify natural things (n. 2162, 3147, 3986, 4382, 4938-4952). And as by the thighs is meant the lower part of the loins, which looks toward the 
feet, therefore the exterior or lower things of conjugial love are signified by the thighs (n. 4277, 4280); but that in general "the loins" signify conjugial love, see n. 3021, 3294, 4575, 5050-5062. 
That "the loins" have this signification is from correspondence. (Concerning the correspondence of all things of man with heaven, see what has been abundantly shown in the places already cited, n. 9276, 
9280.) [2] It is said "the extension of conjugial love from interior things to exterior;" for in the heavens there is an extension of all things of love and of all things of faith, or what is the 
same, of all things of good and of all things of truth, for there all are conjoined according to affinities in respect to the truths of faith and the goods of love. There is such an extension in each 
heaven. This extension reaches also into the heavens which are beneath, because all the heavens make a one; nay, they extend even to man, so that he likewise may make a one with the heavens. This extension 
is what is meant by "the extension from higher or interior to lower or exterior things." Higher or interior things are called celestial and spiritual, while lower or exterior things are called natural 
or worldly.  [3] As to what specifically concerns conjugial love, the extension of which is here described, this love is the fundamental of all loves; for it descends from the marriage of good 
and truth in the heavens; and as the marriage of good and truth is in the heavens, and makes the heavens, therefore love truly conjugial is heaven itself with man. But the marriage of good and truth 
in the heavens descends from the conjunction of the Lord with the heavens; for that which proceeds from the Lord and flows into the heavens is the good of love; and that which is received there by the 
angels is the truth thence derived, thus is the truth which is from good, or in which is good. For this reason the Lord is called in the Word the "Bridegroom" and "Husband;" and heaven with the church 
is called the "bride" and "wife." [4] From all this it can be seen how holy marriages are in heaven, and how profane adulteries are there. For in themselves marriages are so holy that there is nothing 
more holy, and this also for the reason that they are the seminaries of the human race, and the human race is the seminary of the heavens, for thither come the men who in the world have lived an angelic 
life. And on the other hand adulteries are so profane that there is nothing more profane, because they are destructive of heaven and the church with man. (That this is so, see what has been said 
and shown above concerning marriages and adulteries, n. 2727-2759.) [5] From all this it can be seen further why by "nakedness" are signified the filthy and infernal things spoken of in the preceding 
paragraph; and why it was so strictly enjoined that Aaron and his sons, while ministering, should be clothed with breeches, and that otherwise they would die; for it is said, "Thou shalt make them 
linen breeches to cover the flesh of their nakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall be; and they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they go into the Tent of meeting, or when 
they come near unto the altar to minister in what is holy; lest they bear iniquity, and die; it is a statute of an age to him and to his seed after him." [6] Therefore be it known that by conjugial 
love is meant all celestial and spiritual love, for the reason, as shown above, that love truly conjugial is the fundamental of all loves. Therefore those who are in this love are also in all other loves 
of heaven and of the church, for as before said, it descends from the marriage of good and truth in the heavens, which marriage makes heaven. From this also it is that in the Word heaven is compared 
to a "marriage," and is likewise called a "marriage." From this also it is evident why a warning was given that the nakednesses of Aaron and of his sons should not appear while they were ministering; 
for their "nakednesses" signified all loves contrary to heavenly loves, which in general, when they are ends, are called the loves of self and of the world, and are filthy and infernal loves. That 
this is so the man of the present day is not aware, for the reason that he is in these loves, and perceives no other delight than that which is from them. Consequently when spiritual love and celestial 
love are mentioned, he is perplexed, and does not know what they are, consequently what heaven is; and perhaps he will be amazed when he hears and thinks that in spiritual and celestial love, separate 
from the love of self and of the world, there is eternal happiness which is unutterable. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9961</b></p><p><b>9961.</b>
'From the loins even to the thighs they shall be' means the range of those things, that is to say, of those composing that more external level of conjugial love, meant by 'the linen undergarments'. This 
is clear from the meaning of 'the loins' and 'the thighs' as those things which constitute conjugial love, 'the loins' those that belong to the more internal levels of conjugial love, 'the thighs' 
those that belong to the more external levels, so that the range of that love from internal to external levels is meant. The reason why the more internal levels of that love are meant by 'the loins' 
is that these are above; and the reason why the more external levels are meant by 'the thighs' is that these are below. For parts of a person that are above mean things which are more internal, and parts 
that are below mean those which are more external; this is why in the Word more internal things are meant by higher ones, and more external by lower ones, see <a href="3084.htm">3084</a>, <a href="4599.htm">4599</a>, <a href="5146.htm">5146</a>, <a href="8325.htm">8325</a>. The higher parts 
of a person correspond to celestial and spiritual things, which are the more internal ones, and the lower parts correspond to natural things, which are the more external. This is why natural things 
are meant by 'the feet', <a href="2162.htm">2162</a>, <a href="3147.htm">3147</a>, <a href="3986.htm">3986</a>, <a href="4382.htm">4382</a>, <a href="4938.htm">4938</a>-<a href="4952.htm">4952</a>. And since the lower part of the loins which leads down towards the feet is understood by 'the thighs' the more external or lower levels of 
conjugial love are meant by them, see <a href="4277.htm">4277</a>, <a href="4280.htm">4280</a>. </p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The loins in general however mean conjugial love, <a href="3021.htm">3021</a>, <a href="3294.htm">3294</a>, <a href="4575.htm">4575</a>, <a href="5050.htm">5050</a>-<a href="5062.htm">5062</a>; they have this meaning by virtue of their correspondence. Regarding 
the correspondence with heaven of everything present with a human being, see what has been shown abundantly in the places referred to in <a href="9276.htm">9276</a>(end), <a href="9280.htm">9280</a>. The words 'range of conjugial love from internal 
to external levels' are used because all aspects of love and all matters of faith, or what amounts to the same thing, all those of good and all those of truth, have a wide range in the heavens; for 
all who are there are joined together in accord with the degree of similarity between the truths of their faith and the forms of good of their love. A range such as this exists in each separate heaven. 
But the range in each heaven also extends into heavens that are below, because all the heavens make one. Indeed they extend right down to mankind, in order that mankind also may make one with the 
heavens. This range is what is meant by the range from higher or more internal levels to lower or more external ones. The higher or more internal levels are called celestial and spiritual, and the lower 
or more external ones are called natural or worldly.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 As regards conjugial love specifically, whose range is the subject here, this love is fundamental to all other kinds of love; it descends 
from the marriage of good and truth in the heavens. And since the marriage of good and truth exists in and makes the heavens, truly conjugial love constitutes heaven itself with a person. But the marriage 
of good and truth in the heavens descends from the joining of the Lord to the heavens; for what emanates from the Lord and flows into the heavens is the good of love, and what is received there 
by the angels is the truth springing from it, thus truth which originates in good or in which there is good. This is why in the Word the Lord is called bridegroom and husband, and heaven together with 
the Church is called bride and wife.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 All this makes clear how holy marriages are in heaven, and how profane adulterous relationships are there. For in themselves marriages are so holy that 
there is nothing holier, and are so for the added reason that they are the seed-bed of the human race, and the human race is the seed-bed of heaven, since all people who have led an angelic life in the 
world go there. On the other hand adulterous relationships are so profane that nothing is more profane, because they are destructive of heaven and the Church with a person. For the truth of all this, 
see what has been stated and shown in <a href="2727.htm">2727</a>-<a href="2759.htm">2759</a> regarding marriages and regarding adulterous situations.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 All this once again makes it clear why foul and hellish things are meant by the kinds 
of 'nakedness' dealt with in <a href="9960.htm">9960</a> above, and why it was commanded so strictly that when they ministered Aaron and his sons should be wearing the undergarments covering the loins, and that if they did 
not they would die, for it says,  </p>
<p>Make for them linen undergarments to cover their naked flesh; from the loins even to the thighs they shall be. And they shall be on Aaron and on his sons when they 
go into the tent of meeting or when they approach the altar to minister in the holy place, that they may not bear iniquity and die. It shall be the statute of an age<A name="fntext6"></a><A href="#fn6"><sup>f</sup></a> for him and his seed after 
him.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 It should be recognized therefore that by conjugial love all celestial and spiritual love is meant, because truly conjugial love, as has been shown above, is fundamental to all other kinds 
of love. People therefore in whom that fundamental love is present have all other loves belonging to heaven and the Church present in them; for as has been stated, it descends from the marriage of 
good and truth in the heavens, the marriage that makes heaven. This also explains why heaven is compared in the Word to a marriage, and is also actually called a marriage. From this too it is evident 
why precautions were taken to prevent the nakedness of Aaron or his sons from being visible while they ministered; for their nakedness served to mean all loves contrary to heavenly loves, which in general 
are called self-love and love of the world when they are the ends in view, and are foul and hellish loves. People at the present day have no knowledge that all this is so because they are steeped 
in these loves and take delight in nothing except that which arises from them. So it is that when spiritual love and celestial love are mentioned they are perplexed, not knowing what they may be, nor 
consequently what heaven may be; and perhaps they are astonished when they hear and consider that spiritual and celestial love separated from self-love and love of the world holds eternal happiness within 
it that is indescribable.

`A lumbis usque ad femora erunt': quod significet extensionem illorum, nempe exteriorum amoris conjugialis, quae per femoralia lini significantur, constat ex significatione `lumborum' et `femorum' quod 
sint illa quae sunt amoris (x)conjugialis, `lumbi' (x)illa quae sunt interiorum ejus, et `femora' quae sunt exteriorum, ita extensio ejus ab interioribus ad exteriora; quod `lumbi' significent interiora 
illius amoris, est quia supra sunt, et quod `femora' significent exteriora ejus, est quia infra sunt; quae enim supra apud hominem sunt significant interiora, et quae infra sunt significant exteriora; 
inde est quod in Verbo interiora intelligantur per superiora, ac exteriora per inferiora, videatur n. 3084, 4599, (x)5146, 8325; superiora apud hominem correspondent caelestibus et spiritualibus, 
quae sunt interiora, ac inferiora correspondent naturalibus, quae sunt exteriora; inde est quod `pedes' significent naturalia, n. 2162, 3147, 3986, 4382, 4938-4952; et quia per `femora' intelligitur 
pars inferior lumborum, quae spectat pedes, ideo exteriora seu inferiora amoris conjugialis per illa significantur, videatur n. 4277, 4280, {1}at quod `lumbi' in genere significent amorem conjugialem, 
n. 3021, 3294, 4575, 5050-5062; quod `lumbi' id significent, est ex correspondentia; de correspondentia omnium hominis cum caelo, videantur quae copiose in locis citatis n. 9276 fin. (d)et 9280 ostensa 
sunt. Dicitur extensio amoris conjugialis ab interioribus ad exteriora, est enim extensio omnium amoris et omnium fidei, seu quod idem, omnium boni et omnium veri, in caelis, {2}nam conjunguntur 
ibi omnes secundum affinitates quoad vera fidei et quoad bona amoris; talis extensio est in unoquovis caelo; ea 2 extensio quoque {3}est in caelos qui infra sunt, quoniam omnes caeli unum faciunt; immo 
etiam extendunt se usque ad hominem, ut quoque ille unum faciat cum caelis; haec extensio est quae intelligitur per extensionem a superioribus seu interioribus ad inferiora seu exteriora; superiora 
seu interiora vocantur caelestia et spiritualia, ac inferiora seu exteriora vocantur naturalia {1}seu mundana. 	Quod in specie amorem conjugialem, de cujus extensione hic agitur, concernit, est ille 
fundamentalis omnium amorum, descendit enim ille ex conjugio boni et veri in caelis; et quia conjugium boni et veri est in caelis et facit caelos, ideo est amor vere conjugialis ipsum caelum apud hominem; 
conjugium autem boni et veri in caelis descendit ex conjunctione Domini cum caelis, quod enim a Domino procedit ac influit in caelos, est bonum amoris, et quod ab angelis ibi recipitur est verum 
inde, ita verum quod ex bono, seu in quo est bonum; (m)ideo Dominus in Verbo vocatur sponsus et maritus, ac caelum {4}cum Ecclesia sponsa et uxor.(n) 	Ex his constare potest quam sancta {5}sunt conjugia 
in caelo {6}, 4 et quam profana {5}sunt adulteria ibi; sunt enim conjugia in se ita sancta ut nihil sanctius, etiam ob illam causam quia sunt seminaria generis humani, et genus humanum est seminarium 
caelorum, illuc enim veniunt homines qui in mundo vitam angelicam vixerunt; et vice versa sunt adulteria ita profana ut non aliquid profanius, quoniam sunt destructiva caeli et Ecclesiae apud hominem; 
quod ita sit, videantur quae {7} de conjugiis et de adulteriis n. 2727-2759 dicta et ostensa sunt. 	Ex his iterum constare potest cur per `nuditates' significentur 5 spurca et infernalia, de quibus 
in paragrapho praecedente, et cur tam severe interdictum {8}fuit, quod Aharon {9}et filii ejus cum ministrarent, induti essent femoralibus, et quod alioquin morerentur, dicitur enim,  	Fac illis 
femoralia lini ad tegendum carnem nuditatis, a lumbis usque ad femora erunt; et erunt super Aharone, et super filiis ejus, in intrandis illis in tentorium conventus aut {10} accedendis illis ad altare 
ad ministrandum in sancto, ne portent iniquitatem, et moriantur; statutum saeculi ei et semini ejus post illum. Sciendum itaque quod per amorem conjugialem {11}intelligatur omnis amor caelestis et 
{12} spiritualis, ex causa, ut supra ostensum est, quia amor vere conjugialis est fundamentalis omnium amorum {13}; qui {14}itaque in illo sunt, etiam in reliquis caeli et Ecclesiae amoribus sunt, nam 
descendit, ut dictum est, ex conjugio boni et veri (d)in caelis, quod conjugium facit caelum; inde quoque est quod caelum in Verbo comparetur conjugio, et quoque dicatur conjugium; inde quoque patet 
cur cautum, quod nuditates Aharonis et filiorum ejus in ministrando non apparerent, nuditates enim eorum significabant omnes amores contrarios amoribus caelestibus, {15}qui in genere vocantur amores sui 
et mundi, quando fines, et sunt amores spurci et infernales. Quod ita sit, homo hodie nescit, ex causa quia in illis amoribus est, et non aliud jucundum percipit quam quod ex illis est; inde {16} est 
quod cum dicitur amor spiritualis et caelestis, haereat ac nesciat quid sunt, consequenter quid caelum; et fortassis stupescet, cum audit et cogitat quod in amore spirituali et caelesti separato ab
