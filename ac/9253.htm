<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9253节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9253.</strong>“也不可在争讼的事上偏护穷人”表决不可对存在于那些不知道真理的人身上的虚假表示赞同。这从“穷人”的含义清楚可知，“穷人”是指那些拥有极少真理，而且还由于无知而拥有虚假的人。而在他们当中，那些处于良善的人想要被教导真理，而那些陷入邪恶的人则不想被教导真理。因为对那些处于良善的人来说，虚假能被折向真理，最终被驱散；而对那些陷入邪恶的人来说，虚假无法被折向真理，从而无法被驱散。论到这些“穷人”，经上说“不可在争讼的事上偏护他们”，也就是说，不可赞同他们的虚假；因为“偏护”表示赞同，“争讼”表示与虚假相争的真理，以及与真理相争的虚假。“穷人”是指那些拥有极少真理，而且还由于无知而拥有虚假的人（参看<a href="9209.htm">9209</a>节）。与那些处于良善的人同在的虚假是柔软、可弯曲的，而与那些陷入邪恶的人同在的虚假是坚硬、不可弯曲的（<a href="4736.htm">4736</a>，<a href="6359.htm">6359</a>，<a href="8051.htm">8051</a>，<a href="8149.htm">8149</a>，<a href="8298.htm">8298</a>，<a href="8311.htm">8311</a>，<a href="8318.htm">8318</a>e节）。</p>

And thou shalt not reverence a poor man in his cause. That this signifies that no favor is to be shown to the falsities in which are those who are in ignorance of truth, is evident from the signification 
of "a poor man," as being those who are in few truths, and are also in falsities from ignorance. But those among them who are in good, wish to be instructed in truths; whereas those who are in evil, 
do not wish to be instructed. For with those who are in good, falsities can be bent to truths, and finally can be dissipated; whereas with those who are in evil, falsities cannot be bent to truths, 
thus cannot be dissipated. Of these "poor men" it is said "thou shalt not reverence them in their cause," that is, thou shalt not favor their falsities; for by "reverencing" is signified favoring, and 
by "a cause" is signified a controversy of truth against falsity, and of falsity against truth. (That the "poor" denote those who are in few truths, and are in falsities from ignorance, see n. 9209; 
and that the falsities with those who are in good are gentle and flexible, while the falsities with those who are in evil are hard and inflexible, n. 4736, 6359, 8051, 8149, 8298, 8311, 8318.) </p>

'And you shall not show partiality towards a poor man in his dispute' means that no favour must be shown towards the falsities that exist with those who have no knowledge of truth. This is clear from 
the meaning of 'a poor man' as those who possess few truths, and also possess falsities owing to lack of knowledge. But those among them who are governed by good wish to be taught truths, whereas those 
who are ruled by evil have no wish to be taught them. For the falsities with those governed by good can be bent towards truths and at length be dispelled, but the falsities with those ruled by evil 
cannot be bent towards truths and so cannot be dispelled. Regarding such poor persons it says that 'you shall not show partiality towards them in their dispute', that is, you shall show no favour towards 
their falsities; for 'showing partiality towards' means showing favour towards, and 'dispute' means truth contending with falsity, and falsity with truth.  </p>
<p>'The poor' are those who possess few 
truths, also falsities owing to lack of knowledge, see <a href="9209.htm">9209</a>. Falsities with those who are governed by good are soft and bendable, but with those who are ruled by evil are not soft or bendable, <a href="4736.htm">4736</a>, <a href="6359.htm">6359</a>, <a href="8051.htm">8051</a>, <a href="8149.htm">8149</a>, <a href="8298.htm">8298</a>, <a href="8311.htm">8311</a>, <a href="8318.htm">8318</a> (end).  </p>

</p><b>9253.</b>
'Et pauperem non revereberis in lite sua': quod significet quod non favendum falsis, in quibus sunt qui in ignorantia veri, constat ex significatione `pauperis' quod sint qui in paucis veris sunt, et 
quoque in falsis ex ignorantia; sed qui eorum in bono sunt volunt instrui in veris, at qui in malo sunt non volunt instrui, nam falsa apud illos qui in bono sunt flecti possunt ad vera, et tandem dissipari, 
at falsa apud illos qui in malo sunt non flecti ad vera possunt, ita nec dissipari; de his pauperibus dicitur quod illos `non revereberis in lite sua,' hoc est, non favebis illorum falsis; per 
`revereri' enim significatur favere, et per `litem' contentio veri contra falsum (c)ac falsi contra verum. Quod `pauperes' sint qui in paucis veris, et in falsis ex ignorantia, videatur n. 9209; et 
quod falsa apud illos qui in bono sunt mitia sint et flexibilia, at qui in malo, quod immitia et inflexibilia, n.4736, 6359, 8051, 8149, (x)8298, 8311, 8318 fin. </p>
