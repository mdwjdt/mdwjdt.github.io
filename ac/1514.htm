<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1514节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1514.</strong>感官凭气味也能感知这些气场，灵人的嗅觉要比世人敏锐得多。奇妙的是，气味就对应于气场。有些人惯于欺骗，并由此养成欺骗的性情；当他们的气场转化为气味时，就会有一种呕吐物的恶臭。有些人则研究如何能言善辩，以博得他人赞赏，他们的气场会转化为有香味的东西，闻起来象烤面包。有些人只追求享乐，没有仁与信，其气场的气味就象粪便。那些在奸淫中度过一生之人的气味也是如此，不过，他们的气味更难闻。有些人生活在极度仇恨、报复和残忍之中，当他们的气场转化为气味时，就会有一种尸臭味。老鼠的恶臭是从那些极其贪婪的人身上散发出来的；臭虫的臭味则是从那些迫害无辜者的人身上散发出来的。若内在感官被打开，从而与灵人同在，谁都能闻到这些气味。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1514.</strong> Auras also present themselves to the senses through odors, which spirits are much more keenly sensitive to than people on earth are. In fact auras correspond to smells, amazingly enough.<br />Some people have indulged in humbug, which has given them their character. When their aura is turned into a smell, it stinks like vomit.<br />Some have learned to speak elegantly in order to impress others with everything they say. When their aura takes on an odor, it resembles the smell of burnt bread.<br />Some have indulged in mere physical pleasure, without developing any neighborly love or any faith. Their aura smells like excrement.<br />The same is true of those who have carried out a life filled with adultery, although their stench is even worse.<br />[2] Some have lived lives of intense hatred and vengefulness and of cruelty. When their aura is turned into a smell, it reeks like a corpse.<br />The smell of rats wafts from those who have been disgustingly greedy.<br />The smell of bedbugs{*1} drifts from those who have persecuted the innocent.<br />These smells cannot be picked up by any earthly person except one whose inner senses have been opened to allow companionship with spirits.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The Latin words here translated "the smell of bedbugs" is faetor pediculorum domesticorum, literally, "the smell of household lice." But bedbugs are notorious for their foul odor, an attribute ascribed to these "household lice" again in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1514/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4628" target=_top>Secrets of Heaven 4628</a> and Spiritual Experiences (Swedenborg 1998-2002) 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1514/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_3424" target=_top>3424</a>. Furthermore, insects that seem to be of the same type are referred to in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1514/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_1150" target=_top>Spiritual Experiences 1150</a> as "wall-lice." Bedbugs commonly live in crevices in walls, and in fact the Swedish word for bedbug is still v盲gglus, "wall-louse" (once a common term for bedbugs in English). These interlocking passages make the identification of these "household lice" as bedbugs highly probable. The translation by Clowes and his revisers (Swedenborg [1749-1756] 1995-1998) makes the same identification. [LHC, SS] </p>

Spheres are also made susceptible to sense by odors, which spirits smell much more exquisitely than men; for, wonderful to say, odors correspond to spheres. When the sphere of those who have indulged 
in the practice of simulation and have thereby contracted a nature, is turned into an odor, there is a stench of vomit. When the sphere of those who have studied eloquence to the end that everything 
may redound to self-admiration, is made odoriferous, it is like the odor of burnt bread. With those who have indulged in mere pleasures, and have been in no charity and faith, the odor of their sphere 
is like that of excrement. So is the odor of those who have spent their lives in adulteries, but this is still more offensive. When the sphere of those who have lived in deep hatred and revenge, and 
in cruelty, is turned into odors, there is a cadaverous stench. The stench of mice is diffused around from those who have been sordidly avaricious; the stench of bedbugs* from those who persecute the 
innocent. These odors cannot be smelled by any man, except by one whose interior sensations are opened, so that he may be in company with spirits. * Pediculi domestici, a literal translation into Latin 
of the Swedish name for the common cimex. [Reviser.] </p>

Spheres are also made perceptible to the senses by means of odors, which spirits smell far more keenly than men do; for, remarkably, odors correspond to spheres. With people who have given themselves 
up to the practice of deceit and have as a consequence acquired a deceitful disposition, there is a stink of vomit when their sphere is converted into an odor. With those who have studied how to speak 
eloquently so that it may all lead to self-admiration, their sphere when converted into something odoriferous is like the smell of burnt bread. With those who have given themselves up to the pursuit 
of mere pleasure and with whom no charity or faith has existed, the odor of their sphere is that of excrement. It is similar in the case of those who have gone through life committing adultery, whose 
odor is even more obnoxious. With those who have led lives of intense hatred, of revenge, and of practicing cruelty their sphere, when converted into odors, is the stench of a corpse From those who have 
been disgustingly avaricious the stench of mice is given off, and the stench of house-lice or bugs comes from those who persecute the innocent. These odors cannot be detected by anyone unless his 
interior senses have been opened in such a way that he is at the same time in the company of spirits. </p>

</p><b>1514.</b>
Sphaerae quoque sistuntur sensibiles per odores, quos spiritus multo exquisitius sentiunt quam homines: sphaeris enim, quod mirum, correspondent odores.  Qui studio simulatorio indulserunt et inde naturam 
contraxerunt, cum sphaera eorum vertitur in odorem, est nidor vomitalis.  Qui studuerunt eloquentiae eo fine ut omnia sint in sui admirationem, eorum sphaera cum vertitur in odoriferam, est quasi 
odor panis usti. Qui meris voluptatibus indulserunt et in nulla charitate et fide fuerunt, odor sphaerae eorum est excrementitius.  Similiter illorum qui in adulteriis vitam transegerunt, quorum odor 
est adhuc graveolentior.  Qui in gravi odio et vindicta et in crudelitate vixerunt, eorum sphaera cum vertitur in odores, est fetor cadaverosus.  Fetor murium spargitur ab illis qui sordide avari fuerunt. 
 Fetor pediculorum domesticorum ab illis qui persequuntur innocentes.  Odores hi non sentiri possunt ab aliquo homine nisi cui apertae sunt sensationes interiores, ut simul cum spiritibus sit. </p>
