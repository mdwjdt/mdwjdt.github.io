<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2250节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2250.</strong>“你真要将义人和恶人一同毁灭吗”表主因对人类的爱而悲伤，以及祂所做的代求，即尽管他们是邪恶的，但良善仍要被赋予他们。这一点从这些话，尤其接下来的25节经文所流露出的爱的热情清楚可知，25节经文说“你绝不会做这样的事，使义人与恶人一同死亡，让义人与恶人一样。你绝不会这样！审判全地的岂不行公义吗”；同样从“义人”和“恶人”的含义清楚可知，“义人”是指良善（参看<a href="612.htm">612</a>，<a href="2235.htm">2235</a>节），“恶人”是“义人”，也就是良善的对立面，因而是指邪恶。这一点从这些话，以及本章中随之而来的事，也就是代求进一步清楚可知。当主在世时，事实上在祂处于谦卑状态时，祂为人类代求。因为如前所述，在这种时候，祂对着耶和华说话，仿佛对着另一个人说话。而在荣耀的状态下，（也就是人性本质与神性本质已经融合，并变成耶和华之时），祂没有代求，而是怀有怜悯，并出于自己的神性给予帮助，施行拯救。正是怜悯本身构成代求，因为这就是它的本质。</p>

Wilt Thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? That this signifies the Lord's grief from love toward the human race, and His intercession urging that possibly there might be what is good adjoined 
to them although they were evil, is evident from the zeal of love that here shines forth, and still more in verse 25 just below, where it is said, "Be it far from Thee to do according to this thing, 
to cause the righteous to die with the wicked, that so the righteous be as the wicked; be it far from Thee; shall not the Judge of all the earth do judgment?" The same is evident from the signification 
of "the righteous" as being good (see n. 612, 2235), and from the signification of "the wicked" as being opposite to "the righteous," that is, opposite to good, thus evil. It is likewise evident 
from these words, as also from the things that follow in this chapter, that there is intercession. The Lord's intercession for the human race existed at the time when He was in the world, and in fact 
when He was in a state of humiliation, for as before said, He then spoke with Jehovah as with another. But of course in His state of glorification when the Human Essence has become united to the Divine 
Essence, and is itself also Jehovah, He does not intercede, but has mercy and affords aid from His Divine, and saves. It is Mercy itself which is the intercession, for such is its essence. </p>

'Will You also destroy the righteous with the wicked?' means the Lord's grief because of His love towards the human race, and His intercession which He made that although they were evil good should still 
be imparted to them. This becomes clear from the zeal that belongs to the love shining out of these words, and more so out of those in verse 25, where it is said, 'Far be it from You to do such a 
thing as to make the righteous die with the wicked, so that the righteous will be as the wicked; far be it from You; will not the Judge of the whole earth execute judgement?' It is clear in addition 
from the meaning of 'the righteous' as good, dealt with in <a href="612.htm">612</a>, <a href="2235.htm">2235</a>, and from the meaning of 'the wicked' as that which is the contrary of righteous, that is, the contrary of good, thus evil. It is further 
evident from these words and also from what follows in this chapter that it is intercession. The Lord's intercession for the human race was made while He was in the world, and indeed while He was 
in a state of humiliation. For at such times, as stated already, He spoke to Jehovah as if to another. But in the state of glorification - when the Human Essence has become united to the Divine Essence 
and has become Jehovah - He does not at such times intercede but has mercy, gives help from His own Divine, and saves. It is mercy itself that constitutes intercession, for that is what it is in essence. </p>

</p><b>2250.</b>
`Num etiam delebis justum cum impio?': quod significet dolorem Domini ex amore erga genus humanum, et intercessionem quod usque bonum sit adjunctum, tametsi malum, constare potest ex zelo amoris qui 
elucet, et magis in versu sequente 25, ubi dicitur `absit Tibi a faciendo secundum rem hanc, ad mori faciendum justum cum impio, et sit sic justus sicut impius, absit Tibi, num judex totius terrae non 
faciet judicium?'; constat praeterea ex significatione `justi' quod sit bonum, de qua n. 612, 2235; et ex significatione `impii quod sit oppositum justo, hoc est, oppositum bono, ita malum; patet etiam 
ex his verbis, tum a sequentibus hujus capitis, quod sit intercessio; intercessio Domini pro humano genere fuit tunc cum in mundo fuit et quidem cum in statu humiliationis; tunc enim, ut prius dictum, 
locutus est cum Jehovah sicut cum alio; at vero in statu glorificationis, cum Essentia Humana Divinae unita facta, et illa quoque Jehovah tunc non intercedit sed miseretur, et ex Divino Suo opem 
fert, e salvat; est ipsa misericordia quae est intercessio, nam illius essentia talis est. </p>
