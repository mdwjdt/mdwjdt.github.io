<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4644节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4644.</strong>此处论述的主题是良善，也就是主里面与生俱来的神性；该良善与祂作为出生的人而为自己所获得的真理和良善的联结，以及由此而来的衍生物。但由于如前所述，这些事具有诸如无法落入任何人、甚至任何天使的理解范畴的性质，所以详细解释它们是不可能的。更重要的是，它们纯粹是名字，用来描述这神性属世良善及其衍生物；只解释纯粹的名字，没有前后的历史意义给予确认之光，必使整个主题受到怀疑，因为无论把它们说得多么清楚，仍很少有人相信在圣言中，名字表示真实事物。出于这些原因，我只是抄录了本章的内容，并通过诸如适合人们理解、仅仅是笼统轮廓的那类事物补充点大体的解释。因为没有人能看到存在于神性里面的事物；但人们能获得一个从神性发出之物的概貌。这时，所看到的事物便取决于这些事物所能落入其范畴的那种理解力；即便如此，它们也只是笼统的轮廓。<br />另外，要知道，没有人生来进入任何良善；相反，每个人生来都进入邪恶：进入来自父亲的内在邪恶和来自母亲的外在邪恶；因为每个人的遗传就是邪恶。唯独主生来进入良善，并实际进入神性良善本身；因为祂从祂的父那里得来这种良善。主生来所进入的这神性良善就是此处所论述的主题。它的衍生物就是那些存在于主已使之变成神性，并通过神性荣耀它的人身里面的事物。正因如此，在此只补充大体的解释是有可能的。</p>

As the subject here treated of is the good which was Divine in the Lord from His birth, and the conjunction of this good with the truth and good which He acquired to Himself as a Man born, and also the 
derivations therefrom; and because as before said these things are of such a nature as not to fall into the understanding, not even the angelic, they therefore cannot be explained in detail. Moreover 
they are mere names, by which this Divine good with its derivations is described; and to unfold the meaning of mere names, without any historic sense preceding and following to give a confirming light, 
would be to bring the subject into doubt, because no matter how clearly it may be shown them, there are few who can believe that real things are signified by the names in the Word. For these reasons 
I will merely transcribe the contents of this chapter, and add somewhat of a general explication by means of such things as may be adapted to the apprehension, and which are only outlines. For the 
things which are in the Divine never appear to anyone, but the things which are from the Divine appear in a very general manner according to the understanding into which they fall, and yet only as faint 
outlines. Be it known moreover that no man is born into any good, but everyone into evil: into interior evil from his father, and into exterior evil from his mother; for everyone's heredity is evil. 
But insofar as regards the Father the Lord alone was born into good, and into the Divine good itself; and it is this Divine good into which the Lord was born that is here treated of. Its derivations 
are what came forth in the Lord's Human when He made it Divine, and by means of which He glorified it. Hence it is that something of a general explication can be added.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4644</b></p><p><b>4644.</b>
The present chapter deals with the following matters - the Good which was Divine and which the Lord had from when He was born; the joining of that Good to the truth and good which, as one who was born 
a human being, He acquired to Himself; also the derivatives from this. But because these matters, as has been stated, are of a kind which does not come within the range of anyone's understanding, not 
even that of any angel, it is not therefore possible for them to be explained in detail. What is more, mere names are used to describe that Divine [Natural Good] together with its derivatives, and to 
explain mere names devoid of any historical context which sheds light confirming the explanation given would leave the whole thing in doubt. For few are able to believe that spiritual things are meant 
by the names used in the Word, no matter how clearly this is shown to them. For all these reasons the actual words used in this chapter are being copied out, with the addition of no more than a general 
explanation of them involving the kinds of things which people are able to grasp, yet which are merely vague outlines. For no one can possibly see the things that exist within the Divine; but people 
can gain a general picture of things emanating from the Divine What is then seen depends on the kind of understanding within whose range those things can come, though even then they are but vague 
outlines. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 In addition it should be recognized that no human being at all is born into any good. Rather, each person is born into evil - into more internal evil from his father and into more external 
from his mother - for everyone's heredity is an evil one. The Lord alone was born into good, actually into Divine Good itself, in that He received this from His Father. This Divine Good into which 
the Lord was born is the subject now Its derivatives are those things which came to exist in the Lord's Human when He made this Divine and by means of which He glorified it. All this explains why it 
is possible for just a general explanation to be added here. </p>

Hic quia agitur de Bono quod Divinum fuit Domino ex nativitate, deque conjunctione illius Boni cum vero et bono quod Ipse Sibi ut homo natus acquisivit, et quoque de derivationibus inde; et quia 
haec talia sunt quae, ut dictum, non cadunt in intellectum, ne quidem angelicum, ideo non singulariter explicari possunt; et praeterea sunt mera nomina, per quae Divinum illud cum ejus derivationibus 
describitur, et mera nomina explicare absque aliquo sensu historico qui praecedit et {1} sequitur {2} ex quo lux confirmans, foret rem in dubium mittere; pauci enim possunt credere utcumque cis 
ostenditur, quod res significentur per nomina in Verbo; ex his causis licet solum transcribere illa quae in hoc capite, et adjungere aliquid explicationis in communi per talia quae captui adaequata 
possunt esse, quae modo adumbrationes sunt; </p>
<p>nam quae in Divino sunt, nusquam alicui apparent, sed quae ex Divino apparent communissime secundum intellectum in quem cadunt, {3}et hoc solum ut umbrae. 
 Praeterea sciendum quod nemo hominum in aliquod bonum nascatur sed unusquisque in malum, in malum interius ex patre 2 et in malum exterius a matre; hereditarium enim {4}cuivis est malum, sed solus 
Dominus natus et in bonum inque ipsum Divinum Bonum, quantum a Patre; Divinum hoc Bonum in quod Dominus natus, est de quo hic agitur; derivationes ejus sunt quae exstiterunt in Humano Domini quando 
id Divinum fecit, et per quas glorificavit illud; inde est quod adjungi queat aliquid explicationis in communi.      @1 i qui$      @2 i et$      @3 at$      @4 cujusvis$ </p>
