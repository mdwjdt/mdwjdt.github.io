<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第379节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>379.</strong>从前文清楚可知，这些说法指的是这些事物。被“咒诅”表疏远善，这一点在245节已经说明。因为罪孽和可憎的事、或仇恨就是那使人疏远的，以致他只往下看，即注目于肉体和俗事，因而注目于属地狱的事物。当仁被逐出和灭绝时，就会发生这种事，因为这时联结主与人的纽带被切断。将我们与祂联结起来的，唯有仁、或爱与慈悲，绝非无仁之信，因为这并非信，只不过是知识而已，地狱之流也能掌握这些东西，并借此狡猾地瞒骗善人，伪装成光明天使。最恶毒的传道人有时也惯常这样做，他们假装以发自内心的热情讲道，但事实上，除了嘴上说的外，他们心里再没有什么东西。<br />试问谁会如此缺乏判断力，以至于相信唯独记忆中的信、或由此产生的想法能做成什么？人凭自己的经验都知道，如果一个人的话不是出于他的意愿和意图，谁也不会单凭他的话或言辞来评价他。正是意愿和意图使它们成为可接受的，并将人与人联结起来。意愿才是真正意义上的人，而不是人所不愿的想法或言语。人从意愿得其品质和性情，因为驱动他的是意愿。但若他思想善，那么信的本质，即仁，便在其思维中，因为行善的意愿就在其中。然而，若人嘴上说他思想的是善，而生活却是邪恶的，那么他必意愿恶事，故而无信可言。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]379.</strong> These symbolisms can be seen from the preceding sections [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_379/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_373" target=_top>373-377</a>]. The symbolism of a curse as something turned away was also shown before, in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_379/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_245" target=_top>245</a>. Wicked and loathsome acts — that is, acts of hatred — are what turn us away and make us look downward only, toward bodily and earthly concerns, or in other words toward the things of hell. This happens when we send charity into exile and extinguish it, which shatters the bond between the Lord and us. Only charity, which is love and mercy, maintains the bond. Faith without charity is incapable of doing so, since it is no faith but mere knowledge, of a kind that even the Devil's horde can acquire; they are further able to use it for deliberately deceiving the upright and impersonating angels of light. The worst preachers sometimes do the same, with a zeal that seems to spring from piety, although nothing is farther from their minds than what they utter with their lips.<br />Can there be a person with judgment so unsound as to believe that a memorized faith can have any effect by itself? Or that mere thought based on that faith can have any effect? On the contrary, we all know from our own experience that no one can tell the real value of another's statements and assertions if they do not arise from the will or from genuine intent. It is the will and intention that please us and connect us to one another. Our real identity is whatever we will, not what we think or say without willing it. Our will is what determines our nature and character, because it is the will that has an effect.<br />If on the other hand our thoughts are good, then the essence of faith, which is charity, lies inside the thought, because goodwill is present. But if we say our thoughts are good, while we live an evil life, we can never desire anything but evil, in which case faith is out of the question. </p>

That these things are signified, is evident from what has gone before; and that to be "cursed" is to be averse to good, has been already shown (n. 245). For iniquities and abominations, or hatreds, are 
what avert man, so that he looks downward only, that is, to bodily and earthly things, thus to those which are of hell. This takes place when charity is banished and extinguished, for then the bond 
which connects the Lord with man is severed, since only charity, or love and mercy, are what conjoin us with Him, and never faith without charity, for this is no faith, being mere knowledge, such as 
the infernal crew themselves may possess, and by which they can craftily deceive the good, and feign themselves angels of light; and as the most wicked preachers are sometimes wont to do, with a zeal 
like that of piety, although nothing is further from their hearts than that which proceeds from their lips. Can anyone be of judgment so weak as to believe that faith alone in the memory, or the thought 
thence derived, can be of any avail, when everybody knows from his own experience that no one esteems the words or assenting of another, no matter of what nature, when they do not come from the will 
or intention? It is this that makes them pleasing, and that conjoins one man with another. The will is the real man, and not the thought or speech which he does not will. A man acquires his nature and 
disposition from the will, because this affects him. But if anyone thinks what is good, the essence of faith, which is charity, is in the thought, because the will to do what is good is in it. But 
if he says that he thinks what is good, and yet lives wickedly, he cannot possibly will anything but what is evil, and there is therefore no faith. </p>

The fact that such things are meant by these statements is clear from what has gone before, and from the fact that 'one who is cursed' means one who became alienated, as also shown already in <a href="245.htm">245</a>. For 
it is forms of iniquity and abomination, which are forms of hatred, that alienate a person and cause him to look downwards only, that is, towards bodily and earthly interests, and so to things that 
belong to hell. This takes place when charity is banished and annihilated. Indeed the bond that exists between the Lord and man is in that case put asunder. Charity alone, or love and compassion, is what 
joins the two together. Faith without charity never does so, for that is not faith, but mere knowledge such as even the devil's crew is able to possess and by which they are able to deceive and mislead 
the upright and pretend to be angels of light. Very wicked preachers are sometimes accustomed to act in a similar way; they preach with a zeal that seems to be an expression of inner godliness but 
is in fact nothing more with them than that which they bear on the lips. Can anyone be so lacking in judgement as to believe that faith alone residing in the memory has the power to achieve anything, 
or that mere thought from the same source has? Everyone from personal experience knows that nobody places any value on another person's words and assentings if these are not an expression of his will 
and intention. It is will and intention that make them acceptable and join one person to another. The activity of the will is the real person, not thought and utterance of that which he does not will. 
From the activity of his will he acquires a particular nature and disposition, for his will is what moves him. If his thoughts are of good, the essential element of faith, which is charity, is contained 
in his thinking, because it contains the will for good. But if he asserts that his thoughts are of good and yet lives wickedly, the activity of his will cannot possibly be anything else than the 
will of evil, and as a consequence faith does not exist.  </p>

Quod haec significentur, constat a praecedentibus; et quod 'maledictus' significet aversum, etiam prius ostensum est, n. 245; nam iniquitates et abominationes, seu odia, sunt quae avertunt hominem ut 
spectet solum deorsum, seu ad corporea et terrestria, et sic quae inferni sunt; quod fit cum charitas in exilium mittitur et exstinguitur; tunc enim disrumpitur vinculum inter Dominum et hominem; sola 
charitas, seu amor et misericordia sunt quae conjungunt; fides nusquam absque charitate, nam nulla fides est, est scientia mera qualem etiam diabolica turba habere potest, per quam fallere possunt 
dolose probos, et lucis angelos simulare; sicut solent quandoque pessimi praedicatores etiam cum zelo quasi pietatis, tametsi nihil minus apud eos est quam id quod ore ferunt. An quisquam tam infirmi 
judicii esse potest ut credat solam fidem memoriae afficere posse, aut solam cogitationem inde, cum quisque a propria experientia novit quod nullus aestimet alicujus voces et assensiones qualescumque 
sunt, cum non ex voluntate seu intentione? Est voluntas et intentio quae faciunt ut placeat, et conjungunt unam alteri; velle est ipse homo, non cogitare et loqui quod non vult; ex velle trahit naturam 
et indolem, quia illud afficit: at si cogitat bonam, tunc essentia fidei seu charitas est in cogitatione, quia velle bonum inest; at si dicit se cogitare bonum et vivit male, nusquam potest aliud velle 
quam velle malum, quare est nulla fides. </p>
