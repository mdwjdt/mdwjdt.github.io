<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5708节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5708.</strong>“五倍”表大量增多。这从“五”和“倍”的含义清楚可知：“五”是指大量，如下文所述；“倍”（measures，即度）是指从良善所得的真理的状态（参看<a href="3104.htm">3104</a>节）。关于“五”，这个数字既能表示少量，也能表示一些，甚至能表示大量。它的具体含义取决于它与它成为其因子的那个数字的关系（<a href="5291.htm">5291</a>节）。如当它是十的因子时，它的意思和十差不多，只是程度更小一些，因为它是数字十的一半。事实上，正如相乘所得的数字与得出它们的简单数意思一样（参看<a href="5291.htm">5291</a>，<a href="5335.htm">5335</a>节），相除所得的数字与它们的倍数意思也一样；如“五”和“十”、以及“二十”意思一样，也与“一百”、“一千”等数字的意思一样。“十”表示完满和完整之物（参看<a href="3107.htm">3107</a>，<a href="4638.htm">4638</a>节）。给便雅悯的比给他的其他兄弟“多五倍”是由于这事在灵义或内义上的含义；十倍无法被给予，因为这个量太多了。古人从上古教会的传统知道某些数字所具有的含义；因此，每当某种事物突然出现时，他们就会利用这些数字；这些数字能传达这种事物的含义，如此处的数字“五”。在其它时候，他们也会用到许多其它数字，如“三”表示从开始直到结束的完整之物；“七”表示神圣之物；“十二”表示整体上的一切事物。</p>

Five measures. That this signifies much increased, is evident from the signification of "five," as being much (of which in what follows); and from the signification of "measures," as being states of 
truth from good (see n. 3104). As regards "five," it is a number that signifies a little, likewise some, and also much. Its signification depends upon its relation to the number of which it is a part 
(n. 5291): as a part of "ten" it involves the same as ten, but in a less degree, because it is half of the number ten; for as numbers formed by multiplication signify the like with their simple numbers 
(see n. 5291, 5335), so numbers produced by division signify the like as their multiples-for instance "five" the same as "ten" and as "twenty" and also as "one hundred" and "one thousand," and so on. 
(That "ten" denotes what is full may be seen above, n. 3107, 4638.) Five more measures were given to Benjamin than to the rest of his brethren because of the signification of the matter in the internal 
sense; ten measures could not have been given, for they would have been far too much. By traditions from the Most Ancient Church the ancients knew what some numbers signified, and therefore they made 
use of these numbers when anything occurred which they might serve to signify, as here the number "five;" and in other cases they applied several other numbers, as "three" to signify what is full 
from beginning to end; "seven" to signify what is holy; "twelve" to signify all things in their complex. </p>

'Five measures more' means that it was much increased. This is clear from the meaning of 'five' as much, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'measures' as states of truth received from good, dealt 
with in <a href="3104.htm">3104</a>. As regards 'five', this is a number which can mean little, or else something, or even much. Whatever its specific meaning, this stems from its relationship with the number of which it 
is a factor, <a href="5291.htm">5291</a>. When it is a factor of ten, much the same as ten, but in a smaller degree, is implied, five being half the number ten. For just as compound numbers have a similar meaning to the simple 
ones of which they are the product, <a href="5291.htm">5291</a>, <a href="5335.htm">5335</a>, so do divisors have a similar meaning to the compound numbers they divide, as with the relationship of five to ten, also to twenty, as well as to 
a hundred, a thousand, and so on. 'Ten' means what is full and complete, see <a href="3107.htm">3107</a>, <a href="4638.htm">4638</a>. 'Five measures more' were given to Benjamin than to the rest of his brothers on account of what was meant by this 
in the spiritual sense. Ten measures could not be given because that amount would have been far too much. The ancients knew from what had been handed down to them from the Most Ancient Church the meanings 
that certain numbers carried; they therefore used those numbers whenever something cropped up, the meaning of which could be conveyed by those numbers, as is the case with five here. At other 
times they employed many other numbers, such as three to mean what was complete from start to finish, seven to mean what was holy, or twelve to mean all things in their entirety. </p>

`Quinque mensuris': quod significet quod multum auctum, constat ex significatione `quinque' quod sint multum, de qua sequitur; et ex significatione `mensurarum' quod sint status veri ex bono, de qua 
n. 3104.  Quod `quinque' attinet, est numerus qui significat parum, tum aliquid, ut et multum; significatio ejus fluit ex relatione ad numerum a quo est, n. 5291; cum ex decem, tunc involvit simile cum 
decem sed in minore gradu, est enim  dimidium numeri decem; nam sicut numeri multiplicati significant simile cum suis simplicibus, n. 5291, 5335, ita numeri divisi cum multiplicatis, {1}sicut quinque 
cum decem, et quoque cum viginti ut et cum centum ac cum mille et sic porro; quod `decem' sint plenum, videatur n. 3107, 4638; `quinque mensurae' datae sunt Benjamini prae reliquis ejus fratribus, 
ob significationem {2} rei in sensu interno; quia non (x)potuerunt dari decem mensurae, nam hae valde superfluerent; sciebant etiam antiqui per traditiones (c)ab Antiquissima Ecclesia, quid aliqui numeri 
significarent, quapropter illis numeris utebantur, cum tale quid, ad cujus significationem inserviebant, obveniret, sicut hic quinque {3}; et alioquin applicabant {4}plures alios numeros, sicut `tres' 
cum significaretur plenum a principio ad finem, `septem' cum sanctum, `duodecim' cum omnia in suo complexu. @1 simile ergo$ @2 i hujus$ @3 i ut multum prae reliquis significaretur$ @4 in genere
