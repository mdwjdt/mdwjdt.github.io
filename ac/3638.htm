<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3638节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3638.</strong>因此，在来世，相对主，所有社群，无论有多少，都保持在相同的固定位置，而主向整个天堂显为一轮太阳。令人感到神奇，并且因不理解而几乎难以置信的是，在那里，相对每个个体，无论他在哪里，身体转向并移动到哪个方向，社群总保持在相同的固定位置。例如，显现在右边的社群总是在他右边，显现在左边的社群总是在他左边，无论他的脸和身体朝哪个方向转。我也经常通过转动自己的身体而得以目睹这一切。由此明显可知，天堂的形式是这样：相对于主来说，它与大人的存在有关；所有天使不仅与主同在，而且就在主里面；或也可说，主与他们同在，就在他们里面；否则，这一切不会是这样。</p>

From this it is that in the other life all societies, how many soever they may be, keep their situation constant in respect to the Lord, who appears like a sun to the universal heaven; and what is wonderful, 
and can scarcely be credited by anyone, because not apprehended, the societies there keep the same situation in respect to each individual, wherever he may be, and however he may turn himself 
and move about-as for instance, the societies which appear on the right are continually at his right, and those which appear on the left are continually at his left, however he changes his position as 
to face and body. This also it has been given me frequently to observe in turning the body. Thus it is manifest that the form of heaven is such as to bear a constant relation to a Grand Man relatively 
to the Lord; and that all the angels are not only with the Lord, but in the Lord; or what is the same, that the Lord is with them, and in them; otherwise this condition would not exist. </p>

Consequently in the next life all the communities there, however many these may be, remain in the same fixed position in relation to the Lord, who appears throughout the whole of heaven as the Sun. It 
is also a marvel - though scarcely anyone will be able to believe it because he is not able to understand it - that the communities there remain in the same fixed position in relation to each individual 
there, wherever he may be and in whatever direction he turns his body and moves about. Thus communities seen on the right are always to the right of him, and those on the left are always to the left, 
even though he alters the direction in which his face and body are turned. This I have also been allowed to observe very often by turning my own body. From this it is evident that the form taken 
by heaven is such that unceasingly it has to do with the Grand Man's existence in relation to the Lord; and that all angels are not only with the Lord but are also in the Lord, or what amounts to the 
same, the Lord is with and in them, otherwise none of this could ever be so. </p>

</p><b>3638.</b>
Inde est quod in altera vita omnes societates quotcumque sunt, suum constantem situm teneant respective ad Dominum, Qui instar Solis apparet universo caelo; et quod mirabile, et vix ab aliquo credi poterit 
quia non capi, est quod societates ibi teneant eundem situm respective ad quemcumque ibi ubicumque sit, et quomodocumque se vertit et circumagit, ut quae societates a dextris apparent, jugiter 
ad dextrum illius sint, quae a sinistris jugiter ad sinistrum sint, tametsi is plagas quoad faciem et corpus mutat: hoc quoque saepissime mihi datum est observare per versuram corporis; inde patet quod 
forma caeli sit talis ut referat constanter Maximum Hominem respective ad Dominum; et quod omnes angeli sint non solum apud Dominum sed in Domino, seu quod idem, quod Dominus sit apud illos et in illis; 
aliter hoc non ita existeret. </p>
