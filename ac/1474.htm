<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1474节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1474.</strong>“他们就要杀我，却叫你存活”表他们对属天之物不感兴趣，只关心纯粹的认知，他们要带走这些认知。这从刚才所述清楚可知。<br />1474a.创世记12:13. 求你说，你是我的妹子，使我因你得平安，我的灵魂也因你存活。<br />“求你说，你是我的妹子”表智性真理，就是“妹子”。“使我因你得平安”表以这种方式属天之物就不会有施加于它的暴行。“我的灵魂也因你存活”表属天之物以这种方式得救。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1474.</strong> The fact that and kill me and keep you alive means that they would not care about heavenly things but only about the knowledge itself can be seen from the remarks just made.<br />[2] <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1474/bible_king-james-version_genesis_12_13" target=_top>Genesis 12:13</a>. "Please say you are my sister, in order that it may go well for me on account of you and that my soul may live because of you."<br />Please say you are my sister symbolizes intuitive truth, which is a sister. In order that it may go well for me on account of you means that what was heavenly could not be abused in that case. And that my soul may live because of you means that what was heavenly could be preserved in that case. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1474</b></p><p><b>1474.</b>
And they will kill me, and will make thee to live. That this signifies that they would not care for celestial things, but only for mere knowledges, is evident from what has just been said.      Verse 
13. Say, I pray, thou art my sister, that it may be well with me for thy sake, and that my soul may live because of thee. "Say, I pray, thou art my sister," signifies intellectual truth which is a "sister;" 
"that it may be well with me for thy sake," signifies that so the celestial could have no violence done to it; "and that my soul may live because of thee," signifies that so the celestial could 
be saved. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1474</b></p><p><b>1474.</b>
.'And they will slay me and let you live' means that they would have no interest in the celestial things, only in the mere cognitions, [which they would carry away]. This is clear from what has just been 
stated. </p>
<p>[<a href="1474.htm">1474</a>a] Verse 13 Say, now, you are my sister, so that it may go well for me for your sake, and my soul may live because of you. </p>
<p>'Say, now, you are my sister' means intellectual truth, 
which is 'a sister'. 'So that it may go well for me for your sake' means in this way the celestial could not have any violence done to it. 'And my soul may live because of you' means that in this way 
the celestial could be saved. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1474</b>
</p><b>1474.</b>
'Et occident me, et te vivificabunt': quod significet quod caelestia non curarent sed modo meras cognitiones, constat ex illis quae mox dicta sunt. </p>
<p>1474a. Vers. 13.  Dic quaeso, soror mea tu; propterea 
ut bene fiat mihi propter te, et vivat anima mea tui causa. 'Dic quaeso, soror mea tu' significat intellectuale verum, quod est 'soror': 'propterea ut bene fiat mihi propter te' significat quod 
sic caeleste non posset violari: 'et vivat anima mea tui causa' significat quod sic caeleste posset salvari. </p>
