<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8013节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8013.</strong>“本地人和寄居在你们中间的寄居者同归一个律法”表凡在教会的真理和良善上接受教导，领受它们，并照之生活的人应被视为教会里已经受了教导，并照着信与仁的诫命生活的人。这从“同归一个律法”、“本地人”和“寄居在你们中间的寄居者”的含义清楚可知：“同归一个律法”是指一项类似的权利，因而是指它必如同在另一个人那里一样；“本地人”是指一个出生在教会里，并在教义和生活上拥有教会的真理和良善的人，如刚才所述（<a href="8011.htm">8011</a>节）；“寄居在你们中间的寄居者”是指一个在教会的真理和良善上接受教导，领受它们，并照之生活的人，如前所述（<a href="8007.htm">8007</a>节）。<br />之所以说“照着信与仁的诫命”是由于区别；因为重生之前，人照着信之诫命生活；但重生之后，便照着仁之诫命生活。重生之前，没有人出于情感，只出于教义知道何为仁；这时，此人照着教义的诫命，也就是所谓的信之诫命生活。但重生之后，他出于情感知道何为仁，因为这时他爱他的邻舍，发自内心向他意愿良善；并且此时他也照着写在他心上的一条律法生活；事实上，他出于仁之情感行事。这种状态完全不同于之前的状态。处于第一种状态的人在信之真理和良善上处于昏暗的光中，而那些处于后一种状态的人则相对处于明亮的光中。这些人看见真理，并在一种启示或光照的状态下证实它们，而前者看不见真理，也不在一种启示或光照的状态下证实它们，而是出于说服相信教会的教导教导是真理。他们因不在一种启示或光照的状态下看见它们，所以能像证实真理一样证实虚假，并且一经证实，就把它们完全视作真理。由此可见，照信之诫命生活是什么意思，照仁之诫命生活又是什么意思。<br />至于寄居的，在圣言中，经上数次吩咐不要把“本地人”和“寄居在他们中间的寄居者”区别开来。因为寄居者所来自的外邦人，在被教导并并领受信之真理后，和那些教会里的人一样被接入天堂。关于来世的外邦人，可参看前文（<a href="932.htm">932</a>，<a href="1032.htm">1032</a>，<a href="1059.htm">1059</a>，<a href="2049.htm">2049</a>，<a href="2284.htm">2284</a>，<a href="2589.htm">2589</a>-<a href="2604.htm">2604</a>，<a href="2861.htm">2861</a>，<a href="2863.htm">2863</a>，<a href="3263.htm">3263</a>，<a href="4190.htm">4190</a>，<a href="4197.htm">4197</a>节）。这就是为何经上吩咐“本地人怎样，寄居的也要怎样”，如以下经文：<br />若有一个寄居的寄居在你们中间，要将馨香的火祭献给耶和华，你们怎样办理，他也要怎样办理。至于会众，你们和寄居的寄居者都归一例，作为你们世世代代永远的定例。在耶和华面前你们怎样，寄居的也要怎样。你们并与寄居在你们中间的寄居者，当有一样的律法一样的典章。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.14.htm">15:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.16.htm">16</a>）<br />利未记：<br />寄居在你们中间的寄居者，你们要看他如你们本地人一样。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利19.34.htm">19:34</a>）<br /><br />不管是寄居的是本地人，同归一个典章。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利24.22.htm">24:22</a>）<br />民数记：<br />若有一个寄居的寄居在你们中间，要向耶和华守逾越节，他要照逾越节的条例、典章照样地行，不管是寄居的是本地人，同归一个条例。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民9.14.htm">9:14</a>）</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8013</b></p><p><b>8013.</b>
One law shall there be for the native, and for the sojourner that sojourneth in the midst of you. That this signifies that he who on being instructed has received the truth and good of the church, and 
lives according to them, shall be as he who being already instructed is within the church, and lives a life in agreement with the precepts of faith and of charity, is evident from the signification 
of "one law shall there be," as being a similar right, thus that the one shall be as the other; and from the signification of "the native," as being one who has been born within the church, and is in 
its truth and good as to doctrine and as to life (as just above, n. 8011); and from the signification of "the sojourner that sojourneth in the midst of you," as being one who is being instructed in the 
truth and good of the church and receives them and lives according to them (of which also above, n. 8007). [2] It is said "in agreement with the precepts of faith and of charity," on account of the 
difference; for the life before regeneration is according to the precepts of faith, but after regeneration it is according to the precepts of charity. Before regeneration no one knows from affection 
what charity is, but only from doctrine; and the man then lives according to the precepts of doctrine, which are called precepts of faith; but after regeneration he knows from affection what charity is, 
for he then loves his neighbor, and from the heart wills good to him, and he then lives according to a law that is written on him, for he acts from the affection of charity. This state is utterly different 
from the former state. They who are in the first state are in obscurity in respect to the truths and goods of faith, but they who are in the latter state are relatively in clearness. These see 
truths and confirm them from enlightenment, while the former do not see truths and confirm them from enlightenment; but from persuasion that the teachings of the church are truths. And because they 
do not see them from enlightenment, they can confirm falsities equally with truths, and after these have been confirmed, they see them precisely as truths. From all this it can be seen what is meant by 
living according to the precepts of faith, and what by living according to the precepts of charity. [3] As regards sojourners, it is several times commanded in the Word that no distinction should be 
made between a native of the land and a sojourner sojourning with them, for the reason that the Gentiles, from whom the sojourners came, are received into heaven equally as well as they who are within 
the church, when after being instructed they have received the truths of faith. (Of the Gentiles in the other life, see n. 932, 1032, 1059, 2049, 2284, 2589-2604, 2861, 2863, 3263, 4190, 4197.) Hence 
it was commanded that "as with the native, so with the sojourner;" as in the following passages: </p>
<p>     And if a sojourner shall sojourn with you, who shall make a fire-offering of an odor of rest to 
Jehovah; as ye do, so shall he do. As regards the assembly, there is one statute for you, and for the sojourner that sojourneth, a statute of eternity for your generations; as ye are, so is the sojourner 
before Jehovah. One law and one judgment shall be for you, and for the sojourner that sojourneth with you (Num. 15:14-16).      As is the native of you, shall be to you the sojourner that sojourneth 
with you (Lev. 19:34).      One judgment shall be for you; as for the sojourner, so shall it be for the native (Lev. 24:22).      When a sojourner shall sojourn with you he shall perform the passover 
to Jehovah; according to the statute of the passover, and according to the statutes thereof, so shall he do; one statute shall be for you; as for the sojourner, so for the native (Num. 9:14). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8013</b></p><p><b>8013.</b>
'There shall be one law for the native and for the sojourner sojourning in the midst of you' means that someone who has received instruction in and accepted the Church's truth and good, and leads a life 
in keeping with them, will be as someone within the Church who has already been instructed and leads a life conforming to the commandments of faith and charity. This is clear from the meaning of 'there 
shall be one law' as a similar right, thus that it shall be as it is with another; from the meaning of 'the native' as one born within the Church who is in possession of its truth and good in respect 
of doctrine and in respect of life, dealt with just above in Sell; and from the meaning of 'the sojourner sojourning in the midst of you' as one who receives instruction in the Church's truth and 
good and accepts them, and leads a life in keeping with them, also dealt with above, in <a href="8007.htm">8007</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The expression 'in keeping with the commandments of faith and charity' is used because of the difference, 
which is that before regeneration one leads a life in keeping with the commandments of faith, but after regeneration in keeping with the commandments of charity. Before regeneration no one knows 
from affection what charity is, only from doctrine, whose commandments, which are called the commandments of faith, at that time direct a person's life. But after regeneration he does know from affection 
what charity is. This is because he now loves his neighbour and has a heartfelt desire for his welfare; his life is now directed by a law written on his heart, for an affection that belongs to 
charity governs his actions. This state is entirely different from the previous one. People in the first state are in dim light so far as the truths and the forms of the good of faith are concerned, 
but those in the latter state are in comparison in bright light. They see truths and corroborate them in a state of enlightenment, whereas the former see truths and corroborate them not in a state of 
enlightenment but because they have been convinced that the teachings of the Church are true. And since they do not see them in a state of enlightenment they are equally capable of corroborating falsities 
as truths, and having corroborated them they see them altogether as truths. From this one may recognize what is meant by leading a life in keeping with the commandments of faith, and what by leading 
a life in keeping with the commandments of charity.  </p>

 With regard to sojourners, the people were commanded several times in the Word not to make any distinction between 'the native of the land' 
and 'the sojourner sojourning with them'. The reason why was that gentile nations from whom sojourners came are just as much received into heaven as those within the Church are, after they have received 
instruction in and accepted the truths of faith. Regarding gentiles in the next life, see <a href="932.htm">932</a>, <a href="1032.htm">1032</a>, <a href="1059.htm">1059</a>, <a href="2049.htm">2049</a>, <a href="2284.htm">2284</a>, <a href="2589.htm">2589</a>-<a href="2604.htm">2604</a>, <a href="2861.htm">2861</a>, <a href="1863.htm">1863</a>, <a href="3263.htm">3263</a>, <a href="4190.htm">4190</a>, <a href="4197.htm">4197</a>. This was why it was commanded that 
as it was with the native, so it should be with the sojourner, as in Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
If a sojourner should sojourn with you who would make a fire-offering of an odour of rest to Jehovah, he shall do as you 
do. As for the assembly, one statute shall there be for you and for the sojourner who sojourns, an eternal statute throughout your generations. As you are, so shall the sojourner be before Jehovah. 
There shall be one law and one judgement for you and for the sojourner sojourning with you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2015:14-16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 15:14-16</a>.

to you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2019:34&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 19:34</a>.

`Lex una erit indigenae et peregrino peregrinanti in medio vestrum': quod significet quod qui instructus recepit Ecclesiae verum et bonum, et vivit secundum illa, erit sicut ille qui prius instructus 
intra Ecclesiam est, et praeceptis fidei et charitatis conformem vitam vivit, constat ex significatione `lex una erit' quod sit simile jus, ita quod erit sicut alter; ex significatione `indigenae' quod 
sit qui natus intra Ecclesiam, ac in ejus vero et bono est quoad doctrinam et quoad vitam, de qua mox supra n. 8011; et ex significatione `peregrini peregrinantis in medio vestrum' quod sit qui instruitur 
in Ecclesiae vero et bono et recipit illa, (c)et vivit secundum illa, de qua etiam supra n. 8007. 	2 Secundum praecepta fidei et charitatis dicitur {1}ob differentiam; vita enim ante regenerationem 
est secundum praecepta fidei, at post regenerationem est secundum praecepta charitatis; ante regenerationem nemo scit quid charitas ex {2}affectione, sed solum ex doctrina; secundum hujus praecepta, 
quae praecepta fidei vocantur, tunc {3}vivitur, at post regenerationem ex {4}affectione scitur quid charitas, nam {5}amat tunc proximum, et illi ex corde vult bonum, et tunc {3}vivitur secundum

quia non ex illustratione illa vident, aeque possunt confirmare falsa ac vera, et postquam confirmata sunt, vident illa prorsus sicut vera; ex his constare potest quid intelligitur per vivere secundum 
praecepta fidei, et quid per vivere secundum praecepta charitatis. 	3 Quod peregrinos attinet, in Verbo aliquoties mandatum est ut non aliqua distinctio fieret inter indigenam terrae et peregrinum 
peregrinantem cum illis, ex causa quia gentes, a quibus {8} peregrini, aeque recipiuntur in caelum, ac illi qui intra Ecclesiam sunt, postquam instructi receperunt vera fidei; {9} de gentibus in altera
