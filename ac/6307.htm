<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6307节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">关于流注，以及灵魂与身体的相互作用（续）</h4><br />6307.多年来的经历使我得知，有一个流注从灵界通过天使和灵人进入情感和思维。这一点我知道得如此清楚，以至于再没有比这更清楚的了。我不仅感觉到这流注进入思维，还感觉到它进入情感。每当邪恶与虚假正在流入时，我得以知道它们来自哪些地狱；每当良善与真理正在流入时，我也得以知道它们来自哪些天使。这样的经历使我对这一切再熟悉不过了，以致最后我能知道我的思维和情感的每一个细节源于何处。然而，我的思维仍和以前一样。</p>

Continuation about influx, and about the interaction of the soul and the body. That there is an influx from the spiritual world through angels and spirits into the affections and thoughts, has been 
given me to know so manifestly by the experience of many years, that nothing can be more manifest. I have felt the influx, not only as to the thoughts, but also as to the affections and when evils and 
falsities were flowing in, I was given to know from what hells they came; and when goods and truths, from what angels. This experience has consequently become so familiar to me that at last I have been 
able to know whence came every one of my thoughts and affections; and nevertheless my thoughts have been just like those which I had before.      </p>

INFLUX AND THE INTERACTION OF SOUL AND BODY - continued </p>
<p>Experience extending over many years now has allowed me to know about the existence of influx from the spiritual world by way of angels and 
spirits into people's affections and thoughts, to know it so plainly that nothing could be plainer. I have been made aware of it as an inflowing not merely into thoughts but also into affections. Whenever 
evil and falsity have flowed in I have been allowed to know which hells they came from, and whenever goodness and truth have flowed in to know which angels they came from. Experience has made me 
so familiar with all this that at last I have been able to know where every specific aspect of my thoughts and affections originated. Yet my thoughts have been just like those I had before. </p>

Continuatio de Influxu et de Commercio animae et corporis </p>
<p>Quod influxus sit e mundo spirituali per angelos et per spiritus in affectiones et {1} cogitationes, per multorum nunc annorum experientiam 
datum est scire tam manifeste ut nihil manifestius; sensi non modo influxum quoad cogitationes sed etiam quoad affectiones; et cum influebant mala et falsa, datum est scire, a quibus infernis illa, 
et cum bona et vera, a quibus angelis; hoc mihi tam familiare inde factum est ut tandem singula cogitationum et affectionum scire potuerim undenam essent; et tamen usque cogitationes meae {2}fuerunt 
sicut cogitationes (t)mihi fuerant prius. @1 i in$ @2 erant$ </p>
