<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1585节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1585.</strong>“看见约旦河的全平原”表外在人中的良善和真理。这从“平原”和“约旦河”的含义清楚可知。从内义上说，“约旦河的平原”表外在人的一切良善和真理。约旦河的平原之所以有这样的含义，是因为约旦河是迦南地的边界。前面已阐述和说明，“迦南地”表主的国度和教会，尤表其属天和属灵之物；因此，它也被称为圣地，天上的迦南。它因表主的国度和教会，故在至高义上表主自己，主是其国度和教会全部中的全部。<br />因此，迦南地中的所有事物都具有代表性。那地当中的事物，或至内在之物代表主的内在人。如锡安山和耶路撒冷分别代表属天之物和属灵之物。相对边远的地区代表距内在相对较远的事物。最边远的地区，或形成边界的事物代表外在人。迦南地有数条边界，总的来说是两条河，即幼发拉底河和约旦河，还有海。因此，幼发拉底河和约旦河代表外在事物。所以，此处“约旦河的平原”如它所代表的，表外在人中的所有事物。当论及主在天上的国、地上的教会、该国度或教会成员，或抽象地论及爱的属天之物等等时，迦南地的含义也一样。<br />在迦南地，几乎所有城市，甚至所有大山小山、山谷、河流和其它事物都具有代表性。前面（<a href="120.htm">120</a>节）已说明，幼发拉底河因是边界，故代表属外在人的感官和知识之物。约旦河和约旦河平原的情形也一样，这一点从以下经文可以看出来，诗篇：<br />我的神啊，我的灵魂在我里面忧闷，所以我从约旦地、从黑门岭、从米萨山记念你。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗42.6.htm">42:6</a>）<br />此处“约旦地”表低级之物，因而表与属天之物相距遥远之物，如同人的外在与其内在相距遥远那样。<br />以色列人进入迦南地时穿过约旦河，以及那时约旦河分流同样代表通过外在，以及人进入主的国度等等而靠近内在人（参看约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书3.14.htm">3:14</a>至该章末尾；<a href="http://39-27.cn/书4.1.htm">4:1</a>至该章末尾）。由于外在人不断与内在人争战，并努力控制它，故约旦河的傲慢或骄傲逐渐成了先知们所采用的说法，如耶利米书：<br />你怎能与马赛跑呢？你在平安之地，虽然安稳，在约旦河的骄傲中要怎样行呢？（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶12.5.htm">12:5</a>）<br />“约旦河的骄傲”表那些属外在人之物，它们逐渐膨胀并渴望主宰内在人，如推理所做的（推理就是此处“马”所表示的），以及它们所给予的“安稳”那样。<br />同一先知书：<br />以东必令人惊骇。看哪，仇敌必像狮子从约旦河的傲慢上来，攻击伊坦（Ethan）的居所。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.17.htm">49:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.19.htm">19</a>）<br />“约旦河的傲慢”表外在人对抗内在人的良善与真理的骄傲。撒迦利亚书：<br />松树啊，应当哀号，因为香柏树倾倒，佳美的树毁坏。巴珊的橡树啊，应当哀号，因为茂盛的森林已经倒了。听啊！有牧人哀号的声音，因他们荣华的草场毁坏了；有少壮狮子咆哮的声音，因约旦河的骄傲荒废了。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚11.2.htm">11:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚11.3.htm">3</a>）<br />约旦河是迦南地的边界，这从民数记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/民34.12.htm">34:12</a>）明显可知，它还是犹大地的东界，这从约书亚记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/书15.5.htm">15:5</a>）明显可知。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1585.</strong> And saw the whole plain of the Jordan symbolizes the goodness and truth that existed in his outer self, as can be seen from the symbolism of a plain and the Jordan. In an inner sense, the plain surrounding the Jordan symbolizes the outer self, with everything in it that is good or true.<br />The reason the Jordan basin symbolizes these things is that the Jordan was a boundary for the land of Canaan. As previous remarks have shown, the land of Canaan symbolizes the Lord's kingdom and church, and specifically its heavenly and spiritual attributes [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1" target=_top>1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566" target=_top>566-567</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_585" target=_top>585</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_620" target=_top>620</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_662" target=_top>662</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1413" target=_top>1413</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1437" target=_top>1437</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1441" target=_top>1441</a>], which is why it is also called the Holy Land and the heavenly Canaan. And since it symbolizes the Lord's kingdom and church, in the highest sense it symbolizes the Lord himself, who is the all-in-all of his kingdom and church.<br />[2] As a consequence, everything in the land of Canaan carried a representative meaning. Sites in the middle of the land 钬?its most central parts, in other words 钬?represented the Lord's inner self. Mount Zion, for instance, represented his heavenly qualities, and Jerusalem, his spiritual ones. More distant locations represented traits more remote from internal ones. The most distant points 钬?the borders 钬?represented his outer self. Canaan had many borders; in general they were the two rivers of the Euphrates and the Jordan, and the sea as well.{*1} So the Euphrates and the Jordan represented his outward aspects. Here, then, the Jordan basin symbolizes 钬?just as it represents 钬?all the properties of his outer being. The case is similar when the land of Canaan stands for the Lord's kingdom in the heavens; similar when it stands for the Lord's church on earth; similar when it stands for the individual member of his kingdom or church; similar when it stands abstractly for the heavenly attributes of love; and so on.<br />[3] This is why almost all the cities and in fact all the mountains, hills, valleys, rivers, and other features of the land of Canaan played a representative role.<br />Because the river Euphrates was a boundary, it represented the sense impressions and facts that belong to the outer self, as shown earlier, in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_120" target=_top>120</a>. The Jordan and the Jordan plain did too, as the following passages demonstrate. In David:<br />My God, my soul is bowing down upon me. Therefore I will remember you from the land of Jordan, and [I will remember] the Hermons from the little mountain. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585/bible_king-james-version_psalms_42_6" target=_top>Psalms 42:6</a>)<br />The land of Jordan here stands for something lowly and accordingly something remote from heavenly qualities, like our superficial traits, which are remote from our deep ones.<br />[4] The children of Israel crossed the Jordan when they entered the land of Canaan, and at their crossing the river parted. This also represented entry to the inner self through the outer, and an individual's entry into the Lord's kingdom as well, among other things (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585/bible_king-james-version_joshua_3_13-17" target=_top>Joshua 3:13-17</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585/bible_king-james-version_joshua_4_1-9" target=_top>4:1-9</a>).<br />Because our outer self constantly attacks our inner self and tries to gain control over it, "the boast of the Jordan," or "the swelling pride of the Jordan," became a standard phrase among the prophets. In Jeremiah, for instance:<br />How will you prove yourself the equal of horses? And in a land of peace you are smug; but how do you behave in the swelling pride of the Jordan? (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_12_5" target=_top>Jeremiah 12:5</a>)<br />The swelling pride of the Jordan stands for aspects of our outer self that rise up and try to dominate our inner self, as attempts at rationalization (the horses here) and a consequent smugness do.<br />[5] In the same author:<br />Edom will become a ruin. Look: like a lion he will go up from the boast of the Jordan to the dwelling of Ethan. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_49_17" target=_top>Jeremiah 49:17</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_49_19" target=_top>19</a>)<br />The boast of the Jordan stands for pride lifted up by our outer self against the goodness and truth of our inner self. In Zechariah:<br />Howl, fir tree, because the cedar has fallen, because the majestic ones have been ravaged; wail, oaks of Bashan, because the walled forest has come down. The sound of the wailing of the shepherds, because their majesty has been ravaged! The sound of the roaring of young lions, that the boast of the Jordan has been ravaged! (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585/bible_king-james-version_zechariah_11_2-3" target=_top>Zechariah 11:2-3</a>)<br /><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585/bible_king-james-version_numbers_34_12" target=_top>Numbers 34:12</a> shows that the Jordan was a boundary of the land of Canaan, and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585/bible_king-james-version_joshua_15_5" target=_top>Joshua 15:5</a> shows that it was the eastern border of the land of Judah.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} "The sea" is the Mediterranean, which formed the western boundary of Canaan. The Jordan River formed the eastern boundary. Swedenborg elsewhere cites scriptural evidence that the Euphrates formed the northern boundary (see 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3693#subsection-2-5" target=_top>3693:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4116" target=_top>4116</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4454" target=_top>4454</a>; see also both 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_120" target=_top>120</a> and note 2 in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_120" target=_top>120</a> on the borders of Canaan). The geographic limits of the land promised to Abraham and his descendants were always rather vague: the most specific description appears in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_1_7" target=_top>Deuteronomy 1:7</a>, which characterizes it as including "the hill country of the Amorites as well as ... the neighboring regions 钬?the Arabah, the hill country, the Shephelah, the Negeb, and the seacoast 钬?the land of the Canaanites and the Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates" (New Revised Standard Version); see also <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585/bible_king-james-version_joshua_1_4" target=_top>Joshua 1:4</a>. The Deuteronomistic history says that Israel controlled this entire area briefly in the reigns of David and Solomon (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585/bible_king-james-version_2-samuel_8_1-14" target=_top>2 Samuel 8:1-14</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585/bible_king-james-version_1-kings_4_24" target=_top>1 Kings 4:24</a>).

And saw all the plain of Jordan. That this signifies those goods and truths that were in the external man, is evident from the signification of a "plain," and of "Jordan." In the internal sense "the 
plain of Jordan" signifies the external man as to all its goods and truths. That "the plain of Jordan" signifies this, is because the Jordan was a boundary of the land of Canaan. The land of Canaan, as 
before said and shown, signifies the Lord's kingdom and church, and in fact the celestial and the spiritual things thereof; on which account it has also been called the Holy Land, and the Heavenly Canaan; 
and because it signifies the Lord's kingdom and church, it signifies in the supreme sense the Lord Himself, who is the all in all of His kingdom and of His church.  [2] Hence all things that were 
in the land of Canaan were representative. Those which were in the midst of the land, or which were the inmost, represented the Lord's internal man-as Mount Zion and Jerusalem, the former the celestial 
things, the latter the spiritual things. Those which were further distant from the center, represented the things more remote from the internals. Those which were the furthest off, or which were 
the boundaries, represented the external man. The boundaries of Canaan were several; in general, the two rivers Euphrates and Jordan, and also the sea. Hence the Euphrates and the Jordan represented 
the externals. Here, therefore, "the plain of Jordan," signifies, as it represents, all things that are in the external man. The case is similar when the expression "land of Canaan" is applied to the 
Lord's kingdom in the heavens, or to the Lord's church on earth, or again to the man of His kingdom or church, or, abstractly, to the celestial things of love, and so on.  [3] Hence it is that almost 
all the cities, and even all the mountains, hills, valleys, rivers, and other things, in the land of Canaan, were representative. It has already been shown (n. 120) that the river Euphrates, being a 
boundary, represented the things of sense and knowledge that belong to the external man. That the case is similar with the Jordan, and the plain of Jordan, may be seen from passages that now follow. In 
David: </p>
<p>     O my God, my soul is bowed down within me; therefore will I remember Thee from the land of Jordan, and the Hermons, from the mountain of littleness (Ps. 42:6); </p>
<p>where "the land of Jordan" 
denotes that which is low, thus that which is distant from the celestial, as man's externals are from his internals.  [4] That the sons of Israel crossed the Jordan when they entered the land of Canaan, 
and that it was then divided, likewise represented the access to the internal man through the external, and also man's entrance into the Lord's kingdom, besides other things. (See Josh. 3:14 to 
the end; 4:1 to the end.) And because the external man continually fights against the internal, and desires dominion, the "pride" or "swelling" of Jordan became a prophetic expression. As in Jeremiah: </p>
<p> 
    How shalt thou offer thyself a match for horses? And in a land of peace thou art confident; but how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan? (Jer. 12:5). "The swelling of Jordan" denotes the things 
that belong to the external man, which rise up and desire to dominate over the internal man, as reasonings do-which here are the "horses"- and the confidence that is from them.  [5] In the same: </p>
<p> 
    Edom shall be for a desolation; behold he shall come up like a lion from the pride of Jordan to the habitation of Ethan (Jer. 49:17, 19); </p>
<p>"the pride of Jordan" denotes the rising of the external 
man against the goods and truths of the internal. In Zechariah: </p>
<p>     Howl, O fir tree, for the cedar is fallen, because the magnificent ones are laid waste. Howl, O ye oaks of Bashan, for the defensed 
forest is come down. A voice of the howling of the shepherds, for their magnificence is laid waste; a voice of the roaring of young lions, for the swelling of Jordan is laid waste (Zech. 11:2-3). That 
the Jordan was a boundary of the land of Canaan, is evident from Numbers 34:12; and of the land of Judah toward the east, from Joshua 15:5. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1585</b></p><p><b>1585.</b>
'And he saw all the plain of Jordan' means the goods and truths that resided with the external man. This is clear from the meaning of 'a plain' and of 'the Jordan'. In the internal sense 'the plain surrounding 
the Jordan' means the external man as regards all his goods and truths. The reason the plain of Jordan has this meaning is that the Jordan was a boundary of the land of Canaan. 'The land of 
Canaan', as stated and shown already, means the Lord's kingdom and Church, and in particular its celestial and spiritual things; this also explains why it was called the Holy Land, and the heavenly Canaan. 
And because it means the Lord's kingdom and Church, it means in the highest sense the Lord Himself, who is the All in all of His kingdom and of His Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 For this reason all things in 
the land of Canaan were representative. Those in the midst of the land, or that were inmost, represented His internal Man - Mount Zion and Jerusalem, for example, representing respectively celestial things 
and spiritual things. More outlying districts represented things more remote from internals. And the most outlying districts, or those which formed the boundaries, represented the external man. 
There were several boundaries to the land of Canaan, but in general they were the two rivers Euphrates and Jordan, and also the Sea,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> for which reason the Euphrates and the Jordan represented external 
things. Here therefore 'the plain of Jordan' means, as it also represents, all things residing in the external man. The meaning of the land of Canaan is similar when used in reference to the Lord's kingdom 
in heaven, to the Lord's Church on earth, to the member of that kingdom or Church, or abstractly to the celestial things of love, and so on. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Almost all the cities therefore, and indeed all 
the mountains, hills, valleys, rivers, and other features in the land of Canaan, were representative. The river Euphrates, being a boundary, represented, as shown already in <a href="120.htm">120</a>, sensory evidence and 
facts that belong to the external man, and so too did the Jordan and the plain of Jordan, as becomes clear from the following places: In David, </p>
<blockquote>
O my God, my soul bows itself down within me;<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> therefore 
I remember You from the land of Jordan, and the Hermons from the little mountain. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2042:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 42:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the land of Jordan' stands for that which is lowly and so is distant from the celestial, as 
a person's externals are from his internals. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The crossing of the Jordan when the children of Israel entered the land of Canaan and the dividing of its waters at that time also represented the approach 
to the internal man by way of the external, as well as a person's entry into the Lord's kingdom, and much more besides, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%203:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 3:14</a> on to the end of Chapter <a href="4.htm">4</a>. And because the external man is constantly 
hostile towards the internal and strives for domination over it, the arrogance or the pride of the Jordan came to be phrases used by the Prophets, as in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
How will you compete with 
horses? And confident in a land of peace how do you deal with the pride of the Jordan? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2012:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 12:5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The pride of the Jordan' stands for those things belonging to the external man which rear up and 
wish to have dominion over the internal, such as reasonings, meant here by 'horses', and 'the confidence' they give. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Edom will become a desolation. Behold, like a lion 
it will come up from the arrogance of the Jordan against the habitation of Ethan. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2049:17,%2019&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 49:17, 19</a>.

esset, repraesentabat quoque aditum ad internum hominem per externum, etiam hominis in regnum Domini, praeter plura, 705. iii 14 ad fin.; iv 1 ad fin.  Et quia externus homo continue impugnat internum, 
et dominium affectat, formula prophetica facta est, superbia aut elatio Jordanis, ut apud Jeremiam, 	Quomodo parem te praestabis cum equis? et in terra pacis tu confidens, et quomodo facis in elatione 
Jordanis? xii 5; </p>
<p>'elatio Jordanis' pro illis quae sunt externi hominis, quae insurgunt et dominari super internum volunt, ut sunt ratiocinia, quae hic sunt 'equi, et inde confidentia': apud eundem, 	Erit 
Edomus in desolationem;... ecce sicut leo ascendit e superbia Jordanis ad habitaculum Ethanis {2}, xlix 17, 19; </p>
<p>'superbia Jordanis' pro externi hominis elatione contra interni bona et vera: 
apud Zachariam, 	Ejula abies, quia cecidit cedrus; quia magnifici vastati sunt; ejulate quercus Bashanis, quia descendit silva munita; vox ejulatus pastorum, quia vastata est magnificentia eorum; 
vox rugitus leonum juvenum, quod vastata sit elatio Jordanis, xi 2, 3. Quod Jordanes fuerit terminus terrae Canaanis, constat Num. xxxiv 12, et quod terrae Jehudae versus orientem, Jos. xv 5. 	@1 In 
these three places and in n. 1591, I has Jardenis, but always Jordanis elsewhere.$ 	@2 So Sch. Heb. [ ] (ethan) = strong.'  Sch. marg. has habitaculum Ethanis vel robustissimi.$ </p>
