<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">（一）经文</h4><br />（1）那人和他妻子夏娃同房，夏娃就怀孕，生了该隐，她说：“我得了一个人（男性），耶和华。”<br />（2）又生了该隐的兄弟亚伯。亚伯是牧羊的，该隐是种地的。<br />（3）最后，该隐拿地里的出产为供物献给耶和华；<br />（4）亚伯也将他羊群中头生的和羊的脂油献上。耶和华看中了亚伯和他的供物；<br />（5）只是看不中该隐和他的供物；该隐就被大大地激怒，脸沉了下来。<br />（6） 耶和华对该隐说：“你为什么被激怒呢？你的脸为什么沉下来呢？<br />（7）你若行得好，岂不应仰起？你若行得不好，罪就伏在门前。他必恋慕你，你却要制伏他。”<br />（8）该隐与他兄弟亚伯说话，二人正在田间；该隐起来打他兄弟亚伯，把他杀了。<br />（9）耶和华对该隐说：“你兄弟亚伯在哪里？”他说：“我不知道！我岂是看守我兄弟的吗？”<br />（10） 耶和华说：“你作了什么事呢？你兄弟的血，有声音从地里向我哀告。<br />（11） 地开了口，从你手里接受你兄弟的血；现在你必从这地受咒诅。<br />（12）你种地，地不再给你效力；你必流离飘荡在地上。”<br />（13）该隐对耶和华说：“我的罪孽深重，过于所能去除的。<br />（14）你如今赶逐我离开这地面，我必躲避你的面；我必在地上为逃亡者和流浪者，凡遇见我的必杀我。”<br />（15）耶和华对他说：“凡杀该隐的必遭报七倍。”耶和华就给该隐立一个记号，免得人遇见他就杀他。<br />（16）于是该隐离开耶和华的面，去住在伊甸东边挪得之地。<br />（17）该隐与妻子同房，他妻子就怀孕，生了以诺。该隐建造了一座城，就按着他儿子的名，将那城叫作以诺。<br />（18）以诺生以拿；以拿生米户雅利；米户雅利生玛土撒利；玛土撒利生拉麦。<br />（19）拉麦娶了两个妻：一个名叫亚大，一个名叫洗拉。<br />（20）亚大生雅八；雅八是住帐棚者和牲畜之父。<br />（21）雅八的兄弟名叫犹八，他是一切弹奏竖琴和风琴者之父。<br />（22）洗拉又生了土八该隐，他是一切铜铁匠人的师傅。土八该隐的妹子是拿玛。<br />（23）拉麦对他两个妻子说：“亚大、洗拉，听我的声音；拉麦的妻子细听我的话语。我杀男人却伤自己，我害小孩却损自己。<br />（24）若杀该隐，遭报七倍；杀拉麦，必遭报七十个七倍。”<br />（25）那人又与妻子同房，她就生了一个儿子，起名叫塞特。意思说：神另给我立了一个后裔代替亚伯，因为该隐杀了他。<br />（26）塞特也生了一个儿子，起名叫以挪士。那时候，人才求告耶和华的名。<br /><br /><h4 align="center">（二）概览</h4><br /><strong>324.</strong>背离教会的教义、或异端邪说，是此处论述的主题；一个新教会随之兴起，被称为“以挪士”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]324.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_324/bible_king-james-version_genesis_4_1-26" target=_top>Genesis 4</a><br />1. And the human knew{*1} Eve, his wife, and she conceived and delivered Cain. And she said, "I have acquired a man: Jehovah."{*2} 2. And she went on to deliver his brother Abel; and Abel was a shepherd of the flock, and Cain was one who cultivated the ground.<br />3. And it happened at the end of some days that Cain brought forward some of the fruit of the ground as an offering to Jehovah.<br />4. And Abel, too, brought forward some of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat. And Jehovah looked on Abel and on his offering.<br />5. But Cain and his offering he ignored. And anger kindled strongly in Cain, and his face fell.<br />6. And Jehovah said to Cain, "Why has anger kindled in you? And why has your face fallen?<br />7. If you do well, will it not raise you up? And if you do not do well, sin lies at your door. And [Abel] longs for you, but you rule him."<br />8. And Cain said to Abel his brother ...{*3} And it happened when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him.<br />9. And Jehovah said to Cain, "Where is Abel, your brother?" And he said, "I do not know. Am I my brother's guardian?"<br />10. And he said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying out to me from the ground.<br />11. And now, a curse on you from the ground, which opened its mouth, receiving your brother's blood from your hand!<br />12. When you cultivate the ground, it will no longer yield its strength to you. A wanderer and fugitive you will be on the earth."<br />13. And Cain said to Jehovah, "My wickedness is too great to be taken away.<br />14. Look, you have thrown me out today, off the face of the ground. And I will be hidden from your face and will be a wanderer and fugitive on the earth. And it will come about that anyone who finds me will kill me."<br />15. And Jehovah said to him, "Therefore anyone who kills Cain will suffer sevenfold vengeance." And Jehovah put a mark on Cain, that no one who found him should strike him.<br />16. And Cain went out from before Jehovah; and he lived in the land of Nod, to the east of Eden.<br />17. And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and delivered Enoch. And [Cain] was building a city, and he named the city after his son, Enoch.<br />18. And Irad was born to Enoch. And Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech.<br />19. And Lamech took two wives to himself, the name of one being Adah and the name of the other Zillah.<br />20. And Adah delivered Jabal; he was the father of the tent dweller, and of livestock.{*4} 21. And the name of his brother was Jubal; he was the father of everyone playing the harp and the organ.{*5} 22. And Zillah in turn delivered Tubal-cain, who trained every artisan in bronze and iron. And Tubal-cain's sister was Naamah.<br />23. And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, "Listen to my voice, wives of Lamech, and with your ears perceive what I say, because I killed a man for my wound and a little child for my bruise.{*6} 24. For Cain will be avenged seven times, and Lamech seventy-seven times."<br />25. And the human knew his wife again, and she delivered a son and called his name Seth, "Because God has restored other seed for me in place of Abel, since Cain killed him."{*7} 26. And to Seth in turn a son was born, and he called his name Enosh. Then people began to call on the name of Jehovah.<br />324. Summary<br />THE subject here is religious positions developed independently of the church, or in other words, heresies. A new church raised up later, called Enosh, is also treated of.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} (in the text of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_324/bible_king-james-version_genesis_4_1" target=_top>Genesis 4:1</a>). The verb "know" here and in verses <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_324/bible_king-james-version_genesis_4_17" target=_top>17</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_324/bible_king-james-version_genesis_4_25" target=_top>25</a> means to have sexual intercourse with. It is a literal translation of the Latin verb here (cognoscere), which in turn is a literal translation of the Hebrew verb (יָדַע [yāḏa‘]). [LHC]<br />{*2} (in the text of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_324/bible_king-james-version_genesis_4_1" target=_top>Genesis 4:1</a>). The Hebrew here is associating the verb קָנָה (qānā), "get," with the name קַיִן (qayin), "Cain." In the Hebrew, there is an ambiguous particle (אֶת ['eṯ]) before "Jehovah." Most translators take the particle as a preposition meaning "with," but Swedenborg takes it in its other possible function: as indicator of a direct object, which sets "Jehovah" in apposition with "a man." The result is the translation here, "I have acquired a man: Jehovah." Contrast the New Revised Standard Version: "I have produced a man with the help of the Lord." [LHC]<br />{*3} (in the text of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_324/bible_king-james-version_genesis_4_8" target=_top>Genesis 4:8</a>). The clause "And Cain said to Abel his brother" appears incomplete, in both Hebrew and Latin. [LHC]<br />{*4} (in the text of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_324/bible_king-james-version_genesis_4_20" target=_top>Genesis 4:20</a>). Jabal is obviously not the father of livestock, but of those who own livestock. The Hebrew extends the sense of the first clause to the second by a figure of speech called zeugma (or, more specifically, protozeugma), an unequal linking of sentence elements. The passage may also be seen as an example of ellipsis, the purposeful omission of a word or words for rhetorical or poetic effect. However, see the inner meaning of this figure of speech, as explained by Swedenborg in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_324/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_415" target=_top>415</a> (and see also the discussion in note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_324/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_415" target=_top>415</a>). [SS]<br />{*5} (in the text of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_324/bible_king-james-version_genesis_4_21" target=_top>Genesis 4:21</a>). The instrument referred to as an organ here is probably a set of pipes through which the player blows. In <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_324/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_419" target=_top>419</a> Swedenborg describes an organ as midway between a stringed and a wind instrument, so perhaps he is thinking of a reed organ, which is blown but has a stringlike reed that vibrates. [LHC, LSW]<br />{*6} (in the text of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_324/bible_king-james-version_genesis_4_23" target=_top>Genesis 4:23</a>). Lamech is saying that he takes something more than the "eye for an eye" vengeance later sanctioned in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_324/bible_king-james-version_exodus_21_23-25" target=_top>Exodus 21:23-25</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_324/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_24_19-20" target=_top>Leviticus 24:19-20</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_324/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_19_21" target=_top>Deuteronomy 19:21</a>, and mentioned by Jesus in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_324/bible_king-james-version_matthew_5_38" target=_top>Matthew 5:38</a>. That is, Lamech has killed a man for simply wounding him and a child for merely bruising him. The same extreme vindictiveness is also expressed in the next verse: "For Cain will be avenged seven times, and Lamech seventy-seven times." It is possible that the Hebrew original incorporates an old boasting-song, here taken as a reflection of the increased arrogance of the generations of Cain (von Rad 1972, 111). [LHC, RS]<br />{*7} (in the text of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_324/bible_king-james-version_genesis_4_25" target=_top>Genesis 4:25</a>). The Hebrew original that underlies this verse associates the verb שִׁית (šîṯ), "put" (here represented by "restored"), with the name שֵׁת (šēṯ), "Seth." [LHC] </p>
