Verses 10, 11. And they came to the threshing-floor Atad, which is in the passage of the Jordan, and they wailed there a very great and grievous wailing; and he made a mourning for his father seven days. 
And the inhabitant of the land, the Canaanite, saw the mourning in the threshing-floor Atad, and they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians; wherefore they called the name of it Abel-mizraim, 
which is in the passage of the Jordan. "And they came to the threshing-floor Atad," signifies the first state; "which is in the passage of the Jordan," signifies which is a state of initiation 
into the knowledges of good and truth; "and they wailed there a very great and grievous wailing," signifies grief; "and he made a mourning for his father seven days," signifies the end of the grief; 
"and the inhabitant of the land, the Canaanite, saw the grievous mourning in the threshing-floor Atad," signifies a perception of grief by the good of the church; "and they said, This is a grievous 
mourning to the Egyptians," signifies that memory-knowledges have grief before they are initiated into the truths of the church; "wherefore they called the name of it Abel-mizraim," signifies the quality 
of the grief. </p>

Verses 10, 11 And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is at the crossing of the Jordan, and wailed there with great and extremely loud<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> wailing; and he made a mourning for his father seven 
days. And the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at the threshing-floor of Atad, and they said, This is an intense mourning for the Egyptians; therefore they called the name of 
it Abel Mizraim, which is at the crossing of the Jordan. </p>
<p>'And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad' means the initial state. 'Which is at the crossing of the Jordan' means which is one of introduction 
into cognitions of good and truth. 'And wailed there with great and extremely loud wailing' means grief. 'And he made a mourning for his father seven days' means the end of the grief. 'And the 
inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at the threshing-floor of Atad' means a discernment of the grief by the good of the Church. 'And they said, This is an intense mourning for 
the Egyptians' means that the grief existed with factual knowledge prior to the introduction of it into the truths of the Church. 'Therefore they called the name of it Abel Mizraim' means the essential 
nature of the grief.
