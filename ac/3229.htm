<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3229.</strong>如果仅仅历史，也就是外在意义或字义构成圣言，那么其中的一切历史都将是神圣的。而且，那里提到的许多人物会被视为神圣（其中有很多人物的确被视为神圣），以致他们会被奉为神明，因为他们在至圣的着作中被提及。例如那些所谓的族长，就是亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各，以及他们之后的各支派的祖宗、雅各的十二个儿子，还有后来的大卫和其他许多人。然而，所有这些都只是人，其中有些人并不怎么关心神性敬拜。另外，我能证明，他们的现状和普通人根本没什么两样，他们在天堂鲜为人知。但蒙主怜悯，在来世，这些人物及其状态将在别处予以描述。由此明显可知，外在意义或字义仅凭它里面的内义或属灵之义而为圣言，并且外在意义或字义通过内义或属灵之义而存在。</p>

If the Word were the Word in regard solely to its historicals, that is, in regard to its external or literal sense, then all the historicals in it would be holy; and, what is more, many persons there 
mentioned would be regarded as holy, and the result would be (as has actually happened with many of them) that they would be worshiped as gods because they are treated of in the holiest of writings; 
for example, those who are called the patriarchs, namely, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and after them the fathers of the tribes, the twelve sons of Jacob, and later David and many others; and yet all these 
were men, and some of them had but little regard for Divine worship; and I am able to testify that they enjoy nothing beyond the common lot of humanity, and also that in the heavens they are quite 
unknown. But of the Lord's Divine mercy more will be said elsewhere concerning them and their state in the other life. From all this it is clearly evident that the external or literal sense is the Word 
solely from the internal or spiritual sense within it, and from which it is.            GENESIS 25      1. And Abraham added, and took a woman, and her name was Keturah.      2. And she bare him 
Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.      3. And Jokshan begat Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.      4. And the sons of 
Midian: Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the sons of Keturah.      5. And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.      6. And to the sons of the concubines that 
Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts; and he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he was yet living, eastward to the land of the east.      7. And these are the days of the years of the lives of Abraham 
which he lived; a hundred years, and seventy years, and five years.      8. And Abraham expired and died in a good old age, an old man and sated, and was gathered to his peoples.      9. And Isaac 
and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre; </p>
<p>     10. The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: 
there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.      11. And it came to pass after the death of Abraham that God blessed Isaac his son; and Isaac dwelt at Beer-lahai-roi. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *      12. And these are the births of Ishmael the son of Abraham, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham.      13. And these 
are the names of the sons of Ishmael, in their names, according to their births: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam; </p>
<p>     14. And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa; </p>
<p>  
   15. Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: </p>
<p>     16. These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, in their villages and in their castles; twelve princes of their peoples.      
17. And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred years, and thirty years, and seven years; and he expired and died, and was gathered unto his peoples.      18. And they dwelt from Havilah 
unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: he fell upon the faces of all his brethren. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *      19. 
And these are the births of Isaac, the son of Abraham: Abraham begat Isaac.      20. And Isaac was a son of forty years when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean, of Paddan-aram, the 
sister of Laban the Aramean, to himself for a woman.      21. And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his woman, because she was barren, and Jehovah was entreated of him, and Rebekah his woman conceived.   
   22. And the sons struggled together within her; and she said, If so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of Jehovah.      23. And Jehovah said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two peoples 
shall be separated from thy bowels, and the one people shall prevail over the other people, and the elder shall serve the younger.      24. And her days were fulfilled to bring forth, and behold 
twins were in her womb.      25. And the first came forth red all over like a hairy garment, and they called his name Esau.      26. And after that came forth his brother, and his hand laid hold on 
Esau's heel, and he called his name Jacob: and Isaac was a son of sixty years when she bare them. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *      27. And the boys 
grew up: and Esau was a man skillful in hunting, a man of the field; and Jacob was a perfect man, dwelling in tents.      28. And Isaac loved Esau, because his hunting was in his mouth; and Rebekah 
loved Jacob.      29. And Jacob boiled pottage, and Esau came from the field, and he was weary.      30. And Esau said to Jacob, Cause me to sup I pray of the red, this red, for I am weary; therefore 
he called his name Edom.      31. And Jacob said, Sell me as this day thy birthright.      32. And Esau said, Behold I am going to die, and for what is this birthright to me?      33. And Jacob 
said, Swear to me as this day; and he sware unto him, and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.      34. And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up and went 
away; and Esau despised the birthright. </p>

If only the historical narratives, that is, if merely the external or literal sense, constituted the Word, all the historical narratives there would in that case be holy. And what is more, many of the 
characters mentioned there would be considered holy, and, as indeed happens with many, would come to be venerated as gods merely because they are referred to in the holiest work ever to have been written 
- for example, those called the Patriarchs, namely, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and after these the twelve sons of Jacob who were forefathers of the tribes; and subsequently David and many more. 
Yet all these were only human beings, some of whom were little concerned about Divine worship. Moreover I can certify that their present condition is nothing at all out of the ordinary, and also that 
in heaven they are altogether unknown. Those characters and their state in the next life will in the Lord's Divine mercy be described elsewhere. From this it now becomes quite clear that the external 
or literal sense is the Word only by virtue of the internal or spiritual sense Lying within it and from which it exists. </p>

et fieret, sicut fit apud multos, quod ut dii colerentur, quia de illis, in sanctissimo quod scriptum est, agitur; quemadmodum illi qui `patres' nominantur, nempe Abraham, Jishak, et Jacob, et post

                 CAPUT XXV 1.  Et addidit Abraham, et accepit mulierem; et nomen ejus Keturah. 2.  Et peperit ei Zimranem, et Jokshanem, et Medanem, et Midianem, et Jishbakum, et Shuahum. 3.  Et Jokshan 
genuit Shebam et Dedanem: et filii Dedanis fuerunt Asshurim, et Letushim, et Leummim. 4.  Et filii Midianis, Ephah, et Epher, et Hanoch, et Abida, et Eldaah; omnes illi filii Keturae. 5.  Et dedit 
Abraham omnia quae ei, Jishako. 6.  Et filiis concubinarum, qui Abrahamo, dedit Abraham dona; et misit illos ab apud Jishako filio suo, adhuc illo vivente, orientem versus ad terram orientis. 7. 
 Et hi dies annorum vitarum Abrahami, quos vixit, centum anni, et septuaginta anni, et quinque anni. 8.  Et exspiravit et mortuus est Abraham in senectute bona, senex et satur; et collectus ad populos 
suos. 9.  Et sepeliverunt eum Jishak et Jishmael filii ejus, ad speluncam Machpelae, ad agrum Ephronis filii Zohar Hittaei, quae super facies Mamre. 10.  Agrum, quem emit Abraham ex filiis Heth; 
ibi servus Abraham et Sarah uxor ejus. 11.  Et fuit post mortem Abrahami, et benedixit Deus Jishako filio ejus; et habitabat Jishak cum Beer-lahai-roi. 12.  Et hae nativitates Jishmaelis filii Abrahami, 
quem peperit Hagar Aegyptia ancilla Sarae Abrahamo. 13.  Et haec nomina filiorum Jishmaelis, in nominibus eorum, secundum nativitates eorum; primogenitus Jishmaelis Nebaioth, et Kedar, et Adbeel, 
et Mibsam. 14.  Et Mishma, et Dumah, et Massa. 15.  Hadad, et Tema, Jetur, Naphish, et Kedemah. 16.  Et illi filii Jishmaelis, et illa nomina illorum, in villis illorum, et in castellis illorum; 
duodecim principes populorum suorum. 17.  Et hi anni vitarum Jishmaelis, centum anni et triginta anni et septem anni; et exspiravit et mortuus est, et collectus ad populos suos. 18.  Et resederunt 
a Havilah usque ad Shur, quae super facies Aegypti, in veniendo ad Asshur; super facies omnium fratrum suorum cecidit.          *              *               *                * 19.  Et hae nativitates 
Jishaki filii Abrahami; Abraham genuit Jishakum. 20.  Et fuit Jishak filius quadraginta annorum in accipiendo illo Rebeccam filiam Bethuelis Aramaei e Paddan Aram, sororem Labanis Aramaei, sibi ad 
mulierem. 21.  Et oravit Jishak ad Jehovah propter mulierem suam, quia sterilis ea, et exoratus illi Jehovah, et concepit Rebecca mulier ejus. 22.  Et collidebant se filii in medio illius; et dixit, 
Si ita, ad quid hoc, ego? et ivit ad interrogandum Jehovam. 23.  Et dixit Jehovah illi, Duae gentes in utero tuo, et duo populi e visceribus tuis separabuntur, et populus prae populo valebit, e major 
serviet minori. 24.  Et impleti sunt dies ejus ad pariendum, et ecce gemini in utero ejus. 25.  Et exivit primus rufus totus is, sicut tunica pilosa, et vocabant nomen ejus Esau. 26.  Et post ita, 
exivit frater ejus, et manus ejus prehendens in calcaneum Esavi, et vocabat nomen ejus Jacob. Et Jishak filius sexaginta annorum in pariendo illos. 27.  Et adoleverunt pueri, et fuit Esau vir sciens 
venationis, vir agri; et Jacob vir integer, habitans tentoria. 28.  Et amabat Jishak Esavum, quia venatio in ore ejus; et Rebecca amans Jacobum. 29.  Et coxit Jacob pultem, et venit Esau de agro, 
et is lassus. 30.  Et dixit Esau ad Jacobum, Fac mihi sorbere quaeso e rubro, rubrum hoc, quia lassus ego; propterea vocavit nomen ejus Edom. 31.  Et dixit Jacob, Vende sicut hodie primogenituram 
tuam mihi. 32.  Et dixit Esau, Ecce ego vadens ad moriendum, et ad quid hoc mihi primogenitura? 33.  Et dixit Jacob, Jura mihi sicut hodie; et juravit illi, et vendidit primogenituram suam Jacobo. 34. 
 Et Jacob dedit Esavo panem et pultem lentium, et edit, et bibit, et surrexit, et ivit; et contempsit Esau primogenituram. </p>
