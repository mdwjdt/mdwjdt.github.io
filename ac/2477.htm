<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2477节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2477.</strong>有一次，我听见灵人们彼此谈论以下事实，即凡被当作基本原则所接受的东西，无论是什么，都会以无数种方式被证实，直到最后，对已确认的人来说，它完全看似真理，哪怕它是虚假；并且相对于真理，人更容易被虚假说服。为让他们相信这一点，有人提议他们可以思考并讨论：使用外部记忆对灵人是否有益。灵人会以远远超出人的想像或理解的优越方式讨论这类话题，不过，每个灵人都是根据自己的情感来讨论。赞成肉体和世俗之物的灵人以多种方式证实，这将是有益的，理由如下：这样他们就不会失去什么，人死后将和以前一模一样；这样他们就能通过世人回到尘世；生命的快乐就在外部记忆中；其它本能和天赋中没有聪明智慧；此外还有很多其它理由，他们用来确认自己的原则，直到它在他们看来就是真理。<br />但那时，其他灵人通过相反的原则思考和谈论。他们知道自己所思所言都是对的，因为这源于神序。他们说，如果灵人可以使用外部记忆，那么他们的状态和以前还是世人时一样不完美。正因如此，比起使用内部记忆的人，他们的观念更加粗俗和模糊。因此，他们不仅会变得越来越愚蠢，而且还会退化，而不是进步，从而不会活到永远。事实上，再度沉浸于世俗和肉体之物会使他们又进入死亡的状态。他们还说，如果灵人可以使用外部记忆，人类就会灭亡；因为所有人都由主藉着灵人和天使来管理；如果灵人真的通过外部记忆进入人里面，那么人就无法通过自己的记忆思考，而只能通过这个灵人的记忆思考；因此，人就不再享有自己的生命、自己的自由了，而是会被附体，过去的附体（obsessions或Possession）并非指别的。此外还有其它理由。</p>

I once heard spirits speaking together of the fact that whatever is adopted as a principle, no matter what it may be, can be confirmed by innumerable things, until at length, to the man who has confirmed 
himself, it appears entirely true even though false; and that men can be more easily persuaded of a falsity than of a truth. In order that they might be convinced of this, it was proposed to them 
that they should think and speak together on the point as to whether it is useful to spirits to use the exterior memory (for spirits converse on such subjects in a manner far surpassing man's belief, 
or even conception, but each one in accordance with his affection). The spirits who were in favor of corporeal and worldly things confirmed the proposition in question by many reasons, such as that in 
this way they would have lost nothing, but would be men after death equally as before; that in this way they could come again into the world through man; that the delight of life is in the exterior 
memory; and that in no other faculty and endowment are there intelligence and wisdom; besides many other reasons by which they confirmed themselves in their principle, until it appeared to them true. [2] 
But others then thought and spoke from the opposite principle, knowing that what they said was true, because it was from Divine order. They said that if spirits were permitted to use the exterior 
memory they would then be in similar imperfection as before, when they were men; that by so doing they would be in gross and obscure ideas, in comparison with those who are in the interior memory; and 
thus would not only become more and more foolish, but would also descend, and not ascend; thus would not live eternally; for to immerse themselves again in worldly and corporeal things would be to give 
themselves again into a state of death. They said also that if spirits were permitted to use the exterior memory the human race would perish; for every man is directed by the Lord through angels and 
spirits; and that if spirits were to flow into man from the exterior memory, he could not think from his own memory, but only from that of the spirit; thus man would come to be no longer in the enjoyment 
of his own life and his own freedom, but would be obsessed (the obsessions of former times being nothing else); besides other reasons. </p>

On one occasion I heard spirits talking to one another about the fact that whatever is made a basic assumption, no matter what, can be confirmed in countless ways, and with a person who has confirmed 
himself in it, it can at length be made to look altogether like the truth even though it is false, and that people can be persuaded more easily of falsity than of truth. To convince them of this it was 
suggested to them that they should think about and discuss among themselves whether it would be beneficial for spirits to use the exterior memory. (Spirits discuss such matters in far more excellent 
a fashion than man is capable of believing or indeed apprehending; but each spirit does so according to his own affection.) Spirits who were in favour of bodily and worldly things confirmed in many 
ways that it would be beneficial, for the following reasons: That they would then have lost nothing but would be just as much men after death as they had been before; that they would then be able by means 
of man to return into the world; that the exterior memory contains the joy of life; and that intelligence and wisdom reside in no other capability or gift. There were yet other considerations by 
which they confirmed themselves in the assumption they made, so that it appeared to them to be true. Other spirits at that time however thought and spoke from a contrary assumption. They knew that what 
they thought and said was true, because it stemmed from Divine order. They said that if spirits were allowed to use the exterior memory their condition would in that case be as imperfect as it had been 
previously when they were men. That being so, their ideas would be more gross and obscure than of those who employ the interior memory. They would accordingly not only grow more and more stupid, they 
would also decline and not progress, and so would not live for ever. Indeed to engross themselves once again in worldly and bodily things would be to surrender themselves once again to a mortal condition. 
Furthermore they said that if spirits were allowed to use the exterior memory the human race would perish since all men are governed by the Lord by means of spirits and angels, and that if from 
the exterior memory spirits were to flow into man, man would be unable to think from his own memory, only from that of a spirit. Thus man would no longer have any life and judgement of his own but 
would be a man possessed. Possession of people in the past was nothing else. There are further considerations besides these. </p>

Quondam audivi spiritus inter se loquentes de eo quod quicquid pro principio arripitur, qualecumque sit, possit innumeris confirmari, et tandem apud eum qui se conformavit, usque ut appareat prorsus 
sicut verum tametsi falsum sit, et quod de falso potius quam de vero possint persuaderi; ut de eo convincerentur, proponebatur illis hoc ut inter se cogitarent et loquerentur, num conducat spiritibus 
uti memoria exteriore. (Spiritus inter se de talibus loquuntur multo excellentius, quam homo credere, immo capere potest, sed quisque secundum suam affectionem.) {1}  Spiritus qui pro corporeis et mundanis 
erant, confirmabant hoc multis, ex his causis: quod sic nihil amisissent quin post mortem aeque forent homines ac fuerunt ante; quod sic potuissent iterum per hominem venire in mundum; quod in 
memoria exteriore sit jucundum vitae; quodque in nulla alia facultate et dote sit intelligentia et sapientia; praeter plura alia, quibus se confirmabant in principio suo, usque ut hoc appareret illis 
ut verum.  Sed alii tunc ex principio opposito cogitarunt et locuti sunt, scientes quod verum, quia ex ordine Divino; dicebant, si liceret spiritibus uti memoria exteriore, quod tunc in simili imperfectione 
forent, in qua prius cum fuerunt homines: quod sic in crassis et obscuris ideis prae illis qui sunt in memoria interiore: et sic non modo stultescerent magis et magis, sed etiam descenderent non 
ascenderent, ita nec viverent in aeternum; immergere {2} enim (o)se iterum mundanis et corporeis, foret se iterum dare in statum mortis: tum si spiritibus uti liceret memoria exteriore, quod humanum 
genus periret, unusquisque enim homo regitur a Domino per spiritus et angelos, si spiritus ex memoria exteriore influerent in hominem, non potuisset homo ex sua memoria, sed ex spiritus, cogitare, ita 
homo non suae vitae et sui juris fieret amplius, sed foret obsessus; obsessiones olim non aliud fuisse; praeter plura. 	@1 A o parentheses.$ 	@2 immergi.$ </p>
