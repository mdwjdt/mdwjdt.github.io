<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9032节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9032.</strong>这最后两节论述的主题是属灵真理，也就是被记忆真理，即圣言字义的真理削弱之时的源于圣言的信之教义的真理。但由于人们普遍认为教会的信之教义的真理与圣言字义的真理是同一回事，所以要举例说明这个问题。教会教义的纯正真理之一是：对邻之仁和对主之爱构成与人同在的教会，主通过信，也就是通过从圣言所获得的信之真理灌输这些爱，所以唯独信并不构成与人同在的教会。人若接受这一真理并查考圣言，就会发现它处处都得到了证实。然而，当他遇见关于信的话，同时不见爱的提及时，就会犹豫，开始怀疑他的信之教义的真理。因此，这真理在一段时间内被削弱，并与他仍旧相信，并不怀疑的其它真理分离。<br />主在马可福音中关于信的话可作为一个例证：<br />信而受洗的，必然得救；不信的，必被定罪。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可16.16.htm">16:16</a>）<br />由于这些话提到信，同时却未提到爱，所以心智可能会犹豫，并怀疑它被教导的真理，即通过信之真理被灌输的天堂之爱构成教会。但当这记忆真理，也就是圣言字义的真理从内层被审视时，很明显，它确实与教义真理是一致的。因为“受洗”在内义上表示重生（参看<a href="4255.htm">4255</a>，<a href="5120.htm">5120</a>e节），而重生就是通过信之真理被引入爱与仁之良善（<a href="8548.htm">8548</a>-<a href="8553.htm">8553</a>，<a href="8635.htm">8635</a>-<a href="8640.htm">8640</a>，<a href="8742.htm">8742</a>-<a href="8747.htm">8747</a>节）。由此明显可知，圣言字义上所陈述的真理与教义真理是一致的，前提是要以属灵的方式来理解“受洗”表示什么。经上之所以说“不信的，必被定罪”，是因为不信的人不可能受洗，也就是不可能重生，因而也不可能被引入教会，更不用说成为一个教会了。事实上，洗礼是重生，因而引入教会的一个象征，这一切是通过用来自圣言的真理引入良善实现的。<br />由此明显可知要如何理解“人用石头或是拳头打他的同伴，尚且不至于死，不过躺卧在床，若他能起来扶杖而走，那打他的可算无罪；但要赔偿他不能工作的损失，并要将他全然医好”在内义上表示什么。内义上的意思是，如果教会的信之教义的真理被源于圣言字义的记忆真理削弱，但没有被消灭，那么它就要被修复并恢复，修复和恢复是通过正确的解释实现的。</p>

In the last two verses the subject treated of is spiritual truth, which is the truth of the doctrine of faith from the Word, invalidated by means of memory-truth, which is the truth of the literal sense 
of the Word. But as it is commonly believed that the truth of the doctrine of faith of the church is one and the same thing with the truth of the literal sense of the Word, the subject may be illustrated 
by an example. The genuine truth of the doctrine of the church is that charity toward the neighbor and love to the Lord make the church with man, and that these loves are insinuated by the Lord 
through faith, that is, by means of the truths of faith which are from the Word, consequently that faith alone does not make the church with man. He who is in this truth, and consults the Word, is everywhere 
confirmed therein. But when he meets with words about faith, and no mention is made at the same time of love, he hesitates, and begins to revolve doubts with respect to the truth of the doctrine 
of his faith. Consequently this truth is for the time invalidated, and is separated from the other truths which are of undoubted faith. [2] Let the words of the Lord in Mark about faith serve for 
illustration: </p>
<p>     He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be condemned (Mark 16:16). As faith is here treated of, and not love at the same time, the mind 
may halt in doubt concerning the truth of its doctrine-that heavenly love insinuated by means of the truths of faith makes the church. But when this memory-truth, that is, truth of the literal sense 
of the Word, is viewed interiorly, it is plain that it nevertheless does agree with the truth of doctrine; for in the internal sense by "being baptized" is signified to be regenerated (see n. 4255, 5120), 
and to be regenerated is to be led into the good of love and charity by means of the truths of faith (n. 8548-8553, 8635-8640, 8742-8747). From this it is evident that the truth which is the truth 
of the literal sense of the Word agrees with the truth of doctrine, provided it is understood what is signified by "being baptized." And the reason why it is said that "he that believeth not shall be 
condemned," is that such a one cannot be "baptized," that is, regenerated, thus cannot be introduced into the church, still less become a church; for baptism is a symbol of regeneration, and thus of 
introduction into the church, which is effected by introduction into good by means of truths from the Word. [3] From all this it is now plain how it is to be understood what is signified in the internal 
sense by "a man smiting his companion with a stone or with his fist, and that if the man did not die, but lay down in bed, and then rose and walked with his staff, the smiter should be guiltless," 
but that "he should give his cessation, and should heal him;" in the internal sense, that if the truth of the doctrine of faith of the church be invalidated by means of memory-truth from the literal 
sense of the Word, and yet is not extinguished, it shall be made good and restored, which is effected by a right interpretation. </p>

These last two verses have dealt with spiritual truth - which is truth derived from the Word that composes the teachings and belief of the Church - when it has been weakened by factual truth, which is 
truth as stated in the literal sense of the Word. But since the common belief is that truth composing the teachings and belief of the Church is one and the same as truth as stated in the literal sense 
of the Word, let an example serve to shed light on the matter. One genuine truth taught by the Church is that charity towards the neighbour and love to the Lord make the Church with a person, and that 
these kinds of love are instilled by the Lord through faith, that is, through the truths of faith obtained from the Word, so that faith alone does not make the Church. A person who has embraced this 
truth and goes to the Word finds it corroborated everywhere. Yet when he comes up against words that speak about faith without any mention at the same time of love, he hesitates and starts to have 
doubts about the truth he has been taught to believe As a consequence that truth is for a time weakened and separated from the rest which he still believes and does not doubt. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Let the Lord's words 
in Mark about faith serve as an illustration. </p>
<blockquote>
One who believes and is baptized will be saved; but one who does not believe will be condemned. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2016:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 16:16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Because these words refer to faith and 
not at the same time to love the mind may hesitate and have doubts about the truth it has been taught, which is that heavenly love instilled through the truths of faith makes the Church. But when this 
factual truth - that is, truth as it is stated in the literal sense of the Word - is looked at on a more internal level, it is seen to be in agreement nevertheless with the truth as religious teachings 
present it For in the internal sense 'being baptized' means being regenerated, <a href="4255.htm">4255</a>, <a href="5120.htm">5120</a> (end), and being regenerated is being led into the good of love and charity by means of the truths of faith, <a href="8548.htm">8548</a>-<a href="8553.htm">8553</a>, <a href="8635.htm">8635</a>-<a href="8640.htm">8640</a>, <a href="8742.htm">8742</a> <a href="8747.htm">8747</a> From this it is clear that the truth as stated in the literal sense of the Word agrees with the truth as presented in religious teachings, provided that what is meant 
spiritually by 'being baptized' is understood And the reason why it says that 'one who does not believe will be condemned' is that an unbeliever cannot be baptized, that is, be regenerated, nor therefore 
be introduced into the Church, let alone become a Church. For baptism is the symbol of regeneration, and so of introduction into the Church, which is accomplished [by introduction] into good by 
means of truths from the Word. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From all this it is now evident how to understand the things that are meant in the internal sense when it says that a man striking his companion with a stone or 
a fist - and the companion does not die, but lies down in bed - shall be innocent if the companion rises up and walks on his staff, but that he must pay for his cessation [from work], and thoroughly 
cure him. The meaning in the internal sense is that if a truth contained in the teachings and belief of the Church has been weakened by a factual truth which is derived from the literal sense of the Word, 
weakened but not wiped out, it is to be made good again and restored, which is accomplished by right explanation. </p>

{1}  Actum est in binis his versibus de vero spirituali, quod est verum doctrinae fidei {2} ex Verbo, infirmato per verum scientificum, quod est verum sensus litteralis Verbi; sed quia communiter creditur 
quod verum doctrina fidei Ecclesiae sit unum et idem cum vero {3}sensus litteralis Verbi, licet rem illustrare exemplo: verum genuinum doctrinae Ecclesiae est quod charitas erga proximum et amor 
in Dominum faciant Ecclesiam apud hominem, et quod amores illi insinuentur a Domino per fidem, hoc est, per vera fidei quae ex Verbo, consequenter quod non (t)sola fides; qui in illo vero est et consulit 
Verbum, confirmatur ubivis; at ubi offendit verba de fide et ibi non simul memoratur amor, haeret et incipit de vero doctrinae fidei suae dubium volvere; inde verum illud tamdiu infirmatur, et a reliquis 
quae indubiae fidei sunt, (x)separatur. 2 Sint illustrationi Domini verba de fide apud Marcum: </p>
<p>Qui crediderit et baptizatus fuerit salvabitur; qui vero non crediderit condemnabitur, xvi 16; </p>
<p>hic 
quia agitur de fide et non simul de amore, potest mens haerere in dubio de vero suae doctrinae quod amor caelestis insinuatus per fidei vera faciat Ecclesiam; sed cum interius spectatur verum hoc 
scientificum, hoc est, verum sensus litteralis Verbi, patet quod usque cum vero doctrinae concordet; per `baptizari' enim in sensu interno significatur regenerari, n. 4255, 5120 fin., et regenerari est 
{4}duci in bonum amoris et charitatis per vera fidei, n. 8548-8553, n. 8635-8640, n. 8742 - 8747; inde constat quod verum quod est sensus litteralis Verbi concordet cum vero doctrinae, modo intelligatur 
quid significatur per `baptizari'; et quod dicatur {5}, `qui non crediderit condemnabitur' est quia ille non baptizari potest, hoc est, regenerari, ita non introduci in Ecclesiam, minus fieri Ecclesia; 
est enim baptizatio symbolum regenerationis, et sic introductionis in Ecclesiam, quod fit in bonum per vera ex Verbo.' Ex his nunc patet quomodo intelligenda {6} quae in sensu interno 3 significantur 
per virum percutientem socium {7} lapide {8}aut pugno, et non moritur, sed decumbit in lecto, si {9}surrexerit et ambulaverit {10} super scipione suo, quod insons erit {11}, sed quod cessationem 
dabit, et {12} curabit; in sensu interno, si verum doctrinae fidei Ecclesiae infirmatum sit per verum scientificum quod ex Verbi sensu litterali, et tamen non exstinguitur, quod indemnificabitur et 
restituetur, quod fit per justam interpretationem. @1 Matth. xx 21, 22, written at the top of the of the page in A.$ @2 i Ecclesiae$ @3 ex Verbi sensu literali$ @4 After charitatis$ @5 i ibi$ @6
