Verses 28-30. And the damsel ran, and told her mother's house according to these words. And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban; and Laban ran out of doors unto the man, unto the fountain; 
and it came to pass when he saw the jewel, and the bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spoke the man unto me; that he came unto the man; 
and behold he stood by the camels at the fountain. "And the damsel ran," signifies the desire [animus] of that affection; "and told her mother's house according to these words," signifies toward natural 
good of every kind whithersoever enlightenment could reach"; and "Rebekah had a brother" signifies the affection of good in the natural man; "and his name was Laban," signifies the quality of that 
affection; "and Laban ran out of doors unto the man, unto the fountain," signifies its desire [animus] toward the truth which was to be initiated into truth Divine; "and it came to pass when he saw the 
jewel, and the bracelets upon his sister's hands," signifies when it was observed that Divine good and Divine truth were in the power of the affection of truth which is the "sister;" "and when he heard 
the words of Rebekah his sister," signifies the inclination of that affection; "saying, Thus spoke the man unto me," signifies the propensity or inclination of truth in the natural man; "that he came 
unto the man," signifies that it adjoined itself; "and behold he stood by the camels," signifies presence in general memory-knowledges; "at the fountain," signifies their enlightenment from truth Divine. </p>

Verses 28-30 And the girl ran and told [those of] her mother's house all about these things. And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban; and Laban ran to the man outside, to the spring. And so 
it was - when he saw the nose-jewel and the bracelets on his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, who said, Thus the man spoke to me - that he went to the man, and behold, 
he was standing with the camels at the spring. </p>
<p>'The girl ran' means the inclination of that affection. 'And told [those of] her mother's house all about these things' means towards whatever natural 
good enlightenment was able to reach. 'And Rebekah had a brother' means the affection for good in the natural man. 'His name was Laban' means the essential nature of that affection. 'And Laban ran 
to the man outside, to the spring' means its inclination towards truth that was to be introduced into Divine truth. 'And so it was, when he saw the nose-jewel and the bracelets on his sister's hands' 
means when it recognized Divine Good and Divine Truth within the power of the affection for truth, meant by 'a sister'. 'And when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister' means the inclination of it. 
'Who said, Thus the man spoke to me' means the leanings of truth in the natural man. 'And he went to the man' means that it attached itself. 'And behold, he was standing with the camels' means presence 
in general facts. 'At the spring' means the enlightenment of them from Divine truth. </p>

Vers. 28-30.  Et cucurrit puella, et indicabat domui matris suae juxta verba illa. Et Rebeccae frater, et nomen ejus Laban, et currebat Laban ad virum foras ad fontem.  Et fuit, ut videre monile et 
armillas super manibus sororis suae, et ut audire eum verba Rebeccae sororis suae, dicendo, Ita locutus ad me vir; et venit ad virum, et ecce stans apud camelos apud fontem. `Cucurrit puella' significat

videre monile et armillas super manibus sororis suae' significat cum apperciperet Divinum Bonum et Divinum Verum in potentia affectionis veri, quae est `soror': `et ut audire eum verba Rebeccae sororis 
suae' significat ejus inclinationem: `dicendo, Ita locutus ad me vir' significat propensionem veri in naturali homine: `et venit ad virum' significat quod se adjungeret: `et ecce stans apud camelos'
