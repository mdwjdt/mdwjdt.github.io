<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第242节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>242.</strong>创世记3:14 耶和华神对蛇说，你既作了这事，就必受咒诅，比一切的牲畜和田间的走兽更甚。你必用肚子行走，终身以尘埃为食。<br />“耶和华神对蛇说”，表示他们已发觉感官是堕落之因；“蛇受咒诅，比一切的牲畜和田间的走兽更甚”，表示感官与属天之性颠倒，转向肉体，自招咒诅；“牲畜走兽”在此表情感，和前面一样；“蛇用肚子行走”，表示感官不再向上，而是朝下，关注肉体和尘世；“终身以尘埃为食”，表示感官沦落至以肉体和尘世之物为生，成为属地狱的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]242.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_242/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_14" target=_top>Genesis 3:14</a>. And Jehovah God said to the snake, "Because you have done this, a curse on you, above every beast and above every wild animal of the field! You will travel on your belly and eat dirt all the days of your life."<br />Jehovah God said to the snake means that they perceived their reliance on their senses to be at fault. The curse on the snake above every beast and above every wild animal of the field symbolizes the fact that the sensory level of their mind turned away from what was heavenly toward what was bodily, bringing a curse on itself. Here as before the beast and the wild animal of the field symbolize feelings [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_242/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_46" target=_top>46</a>]. The serpent's traveling on its belly means that the sensory level could no longer look up toward heavenly values but had to look down toward bodily and earthly ones. Eating dirt all the days of its life means that the sensory plane became incapable of living on anything but what was bodily and earthly, so that it turned hellish. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 242</b></p><p><b>242.</b>
Verse 14. And Jehovah God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above every beast, and above every wild animal of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt 
thou eat all the days of thy life. By "Jehovah God said unto the serpent" is signified that they perceived their sensuous part to be the cause [of their fall]. "The serpent cursed above every beast and 
above every wild animal of the field" signifies that their sensuous part averted itself from that which is heavenly, and turned itself to that which is of the body, and thus cursed itself; the "beast" 
and the "wild animal of the field" here signify affections, as before. The "serpent going upon its belly" signifies that their sensuous part could no longer look upward to the things of heaven, but 
only downward, to those of the body and the earth. Its "eating dust all the days of its life" signifies that their sensuous part became such that it could not live from anything but that which is of 
the body and the earth, that is to say, it became infernal. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 242</b></p><p><b>242.</b>
Verse 14 And Jehovah God said to the serpent, Because you have done this, cursed are you, more than every beast, and more than every wild animal of the field; on your belly you will go, and dust will 
you eat all the days of your life.  </p>
<p>'Jehovah God said to the serpent' means they perceived that their sensory-mindedness was the cause. 'The serpent was cursed, more than every beast and wild animal 
of the field' means that the sensory part turned away from the heavenly and towards the bodily, and in so doing brought a curse upon itself. 'Beast' and 'wild animal of the field' here, as previously, 
mean affections. 'The serpent going on its belly' means that the sensory part was no longer able to look up to heavenly things, only downwards to bodily and earthly things. 'It was to eat dust all 
the days of its life' means that the sensory part had become such as could live from nothing but the bodily and earthly, and so had become hellish.  </p>

</p><b>242.</b>
Vers. 14.  Et dixit Jehovah Deus ad serpentem, Quia fecisti hoc, maledictus tu prae omni bestia, et prae omni fera agri; super ventre tuo ambulabis, et pulverem edes omnibus diebus vitae tuae. 'Quod 
Jehovah Deus dixerit ad serpentem' significat quod perceperint sensuale suum in causa esse: 'quod serpens maledictus prae omni bestia et fera agri' significat quod sensuale averterit se a caelesti et 
converterit se ad corporeum, ac ita sibi maledixerit: 'bestia et fera agri' significat hic, ut prius, affectiones: quod 'serpens super ventre ambularet' est quod sensuale non amplius spectare posset 
sursum ad caelestia, sed deorsum ad corporea et terrestria: quod 'pulverem comederet omnibus diebus vitae' est quod sensuale ita factam ut ex alio quam ex corporeo et terrestri vivere non posset, ita 
infernale. </p>
