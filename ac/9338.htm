<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9338节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9338.</strong>“承受那地为业”表直到处于良善，因而重生之时。这从“承受”和“地”的含义清楚可知：“承受”是指作为一个继承人去接受，如下文所述；“地”，即此处的迦南地，是指主的国度，因而是指天堂（参看<a href="1413.htm">1413</a>，<a href="1437.htm">1437</a>，<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="1866.htm">1866</a>，<a href="3038.htm">3038</a>，<a href="3481.htm">3481</a>，<a href="3686.htm">3686</a>，<a href="3705.htm">3705</a>，<a href="4240.htm">4240</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>节）。因此，“承受那地为业”表示作为一个继承人去接受天堂。当论及天堂时，“一个继承人”尤指一个从主拥有生命的人（<a href="2658.htm">2658</a>，<a href="2851.htm">2851</a>，<a href="3672.htm">3672</a>，<a href="7212.htm">7212</a>节），因而是指一个处于从主所获得的良善，从而已经重生的人。当一个人处于从主所获得的良善时，他就在天堂中，因而重生了（参看<a href="9274.htm">9274</a>节，以及那时所引用的章节）。<br />“承受”当论及天堂时，就具有这种含义，这一点明显可见于马太福音：<br />于是王要向那在祂右手边的说，你们这蒙我父赐福的，可来承受那创世以来为你们所预备的国。因为我饿了，你们给我吃。渴了，你们给我喝。这些事你们既作在我这弟兄中一个最小的身上，就是作在我身上了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.34.htm">25:34</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.35.htm">35</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.40.htm">40</a>）<br />此处“承受主的国或天堂”是指着那些处于良善的人说的；实际的仁之良善也按次序被列举出来；最后经上说“这些事你们既作在我这弟兄中一个最小的身上，就是作在我身上了”。那些处于良善的人，因而那些行善的人被称为主的“弟兄”（<a href="6756.htm">6756</a>节）；因为良善就是与一个人同在的主。这就是为何经上说“你们既作在我这弟兄中一个（最小的）身上”，而不是说“弟兄中的一个身上”。<br />启示录：<br />得胜的，必承受这些为业。我要作他的神，他要作我的儿子。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.7.htm">21:7</a>）<br />这化<br />论到那些得胜的人，经上说他们“必承受这些为业”，他们还被称为“儿子”，因为他们就是继承人；“得胜”表示用良善和真理去争战；因为邪恶通过良善被战胜；虚假通过真理被战胜。<br />诗篇：<br />神要拯救锡安，建造犹大的城邑。他们要在那里居住，得以为业。祂仆人的种要承受为业。爱祂名的人也要住在其中。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗69.35.htm">69:35</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗69.36.htm">36</a>）<br />此处“得以为业”论及那些处于属天良善的人；“承受为业”论及那些处于属灵良善的人。属天良善是对主之爱的良善，属灵良善是对邻之仁的良善（<a href="9277.htm">9277</a>节）。以赛亚书：<br />那投靠我的必承受地土，必得我的圣山为业。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛57.13.htm">57:13</a>）<br />由此明显可知被划分为十二份地业给以色列十二支派的迦南地表示什么（约书亚记十四到十九章；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.13.htm">47:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.22.htm">22</a>；以及四十八章）。因为“迦南地”表示主的国度，或天堂（<a href="1413.htm">1413</a>，<a href="1437.htm">1437</a>，<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="1866.htm">1866</a>，<a href="3038.htm">3038</a>，<a href="3481.htm">3481</a>，<a href="3686.htm">3686</a>，<a href="3705.htm">3705</a>，<a href="4240.htm">4240</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>节）；“十二支派”表示一切良善和真理，无论总体还是细节（<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="3862.htm">3862</a>，<a href="3926.htm">3926</a>，<a href="3939.htm">3939</a>，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>，<a href="6335.htm">6335</a>，<a href="6337.htm">6337</a>，<a href="6397.htm">6397</a>，<a href="6640.htm">6640</a>节）。因此，十二份地业表示天堂及其众天堂和其中的社群，它们根据爱之良善和由此而来的信之真理而彼此分隔开（<a href="7836.htm">7836</a>，<a href="7891.htm">7891</a>，<a href="7996.htm">7996</a>节）；因此，这些地业在抽象意义上表示源于主，因而就是天上的主的良善本身。<br />因为天堂无非是从主的神性良善发出的神性真理。天上的天使是接受良善中的真理者；他们在何等程度上接受它，就在何等程度上构成天堂。而且（这是一个奥秘），主不会与一位天使同住，除非住在与这位天使同在的祂自己的东西中。主以同样的方式与一个人同住；因为神性真理必住在属神之物中，而不住在属任何人的自我之物中。在约翰福音，主论到祂自己与那些处于爱之良善的人结合时所说的话就表示这一点：<br />到那日，你们就知道我在父里面，你们在我里面，我也在你们里面。人若爱我，就必遵守我的话，我们要到他那里去，与他同住。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.20.htm">14:20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.23.htm">23</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />你所赐给我的荣耀，我已赐给他们，使他们合而为一，像我们合而为一。使你所爱我的爱在他们里面，我也在他们里面。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.22.htm">17:22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.26.htm">26</a>）</p>

And inherit the land. That this signifies until in good, and thus regenerate, is evident from the signification of "inheriting," as being to receive as an heir (of which in what follows); and from the 
signification of "the land," here the land of Canaan, as being the kingdom of the Lord, thus heaven (see n. 1413, 1437, 1607, 1866, 3038, 3481, 3686, 3705, 4240, 4447). Therefore by "inheriting the 
land" is signified receiving heaven as an heir. By "an heir," when said of heaven, is especially meant a man who has the Lord's life (n. 2658, 2851, 3672, 7212), thus one who is in good from the Lord, 
and consequently who is regenerate. (That when a man is in good from the Lord, he is in heaven, thus regenerate, see n. 9274, and the passages there cited.) [2] That this is signified by "inheriting," 
when said of heaven, is plain in Matthew: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Then shall the King say to those on His right hand, Come ye blessed of My Father, possess as an inheritance the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation 
of the world; for I was hungry, and ye gave Me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave Me to drink. Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye did it unto Me (Matt. 25:34, 
35, 40); </p>
</blockquote>
<p>here "to possess as an inheritance the kingdom of the Lord," that is, heaven, is said of those who are in good; the very goods of charity are also enumerated in their order; and finally it 
is said, "inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye did it unto Me." Those are called the Lord's "brethren" who are in good (n. 6756); thus also those who do what is good, for 
good is the Lord with man. Therefore it is said, "inasmuch as ye did it unto one of 
[the least of] these brethren;" but not "to one of the brethren." </p>
<p>[3] In Revelation: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>He that overcometh shall receive by 
inheritance all things; and I will be his God, and be shall be My son (Rev. 21:7);
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>speaking of those who overcome it is said they "shall receive by inheritance all things," and they are called "sons," 
because heirs; "to overcome" denotes to fight from good and truth; for evil is overcome by means of good; and falsity by means of truth. </p>
<p>[4] In David: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>God will save Zion, and build the cities 
of Judah; and they shall dwell there, and possess it by inheritance. The seed also of His servants shall inherit it; and they that love His name shall dwell therein (Ps. 69:35, 36); 
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where "to possess 
by inheritance" is predicated of those who are in celestial good; and "to inherit" of those who are in spiritual good. Celestial good is the good of love to the Lord, and spiritual good is the good 
of charity toward the neighbor (n. 9277). In Isaiah: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>He that confideth in Me shall inherit the land, and shall possess by inheritance the mountain of My holiness (Isa. 57:13). 
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>     [5] From all this 
it is evident what is signified by the land of Canaan being distributed into twelve inheritances for the twelve tribes of Israel (Josh. 14 to 19; and Ezek. 47:13-22; also Ezek. 48); for by "the land 
of Canaan" was signified the kingdom of the Lord, or heaven (n. 1413, 1437, 1607, 1866, 3038, 3481, 3686, 3705, 4240, 4447); by the "twelve tribes" were signified all goods and truths in general and in 
particular (n. 3858, 3862, 3926, 3939, 4060, 6335, 6337, 6397, 6640); thus by the twelve inheritances was signified heaven with all the heavens and the societies therein, distinct in respect to the 
goods of love and the derivative truths of faith (n. 7836, 7891, 7996); thus in the abstract sense the goods themselves which are from the Lord, consequently which are the Lord in heaven. [6] For heaven 
is nothing else than the Divine truth which proceeds from the Lord's Divine good. The angels of heaven are recipients of truth in good; and insofar as they receive this, so far they make heaven. And-this 
is a secret-the Lord does not dwell with an angel except in His own with him. In like manner He dwells with a man; for the Divine must be in what is Divine, and not in what belongs to any man. 
This is meant by the words of the Lord concerning the union of Himself with those who are in the good of love, in John: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>In that day ye shall know that I am in the Father, and ye in Me, and I in 
you. He that loveth Me keepeth My word, and We will come unto him, and make our abode with him (John 14:20, 23).      The glory which Thou hast given Me I have given them; that they may be one; as We 
are one; that the love wherewith Thou hast loved Me may be in them, and I in them (John 17:22, 26).
	</p>

'And inherit the land' means when governed by good, thus when regenerated. This is clear from the meaning of 'inheriting' as receiving as an heir, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'the land', 
at this point the land of Canaan, as the Lord's kingdom, thus heaven, dealt with in <a href="1413.htm">1413</a>, <a href="1437.htm">1437</a>, <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>, <a href="1866.htm">1866</a>, <a href="3038.htm">3038</a>, <a href="3481.htm">3481</a>, <a href="3705.htm">3705</a>, <a href="3686.htm">3686</a>, <a href="4240.htm">4240</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>, so that 'inheriting the land' means receiving heaven as 
an heir to it. The proper way to understand the word 'heir', when used in reference to heaven, is a person who has life from the Lord, <a href="2658.htm">2658</a>, <a href="2851.htm">2851</a>, <a href="3672.htm">3672</a>, <a href="7212.htm">7212</a>, thus who is governed by good received from 
the Lord, who therefore has been regenerated. The fact that a person is in heaven, and so has been regenerated, when he is governed by good received from the Lord, see <a href="9274.htm">9274</a> and the places referred 
to there.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that 'inheriting' has this meaning, when used in reference to heaven, is evident in Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
Then the King will say to those who are at His right hand, Come, O blessed 
of My Father, possess as an inheritance the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave Me food, I was thirsty and you gave Me drink. Insofar as you did it 
to one of the least of these My brothers you did it to Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2025:34,%2035,%2040&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 25:34, 35, 40</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Possessing as an inheritance the Lord's kingdom (or heaven)' is said here in regard to those governed by good; and 
the actual forms of the good of charity in their proper order are also enumerated. Finally it is said, 'Insofar as you did it to one of the least of these My brothers you did it to Me'. People are called 
the Lord's brothers if they are governed by good, <a href="6756.htm">6756</a>, thus also if they practise good; for good is the Lord present with a person. And this is why it says, 'Insofar as you did it to one of [the 
least of] these My brothers' (not simply 'brothers').  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Revelation,  </p>
<blockquote>
He who overcomes will receive all things by inheritance, and I will be his God and he will be My son. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2021:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 21:7</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>It 
says here of those who overcome that they will receive all things by inheritance; and because they are heirs they are called 'sons'. 'Overcoming' means using good and truth to fight with, for evil is 
overcome by means of good, and falsity by means of truth.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In David,  </p>
<blockquote>
God will save Zion and will build the cities of Judah; and they will dwell there and possess it by inheritance; and the 
seed of His servants will inherit it, and those loving His name will dwell in it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2069:35,%2036&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 69:35, 36</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'possessing by inheritance' has regard to those governed by celestial good, and 'inheriting' 
to those governed by spiritual good. Celestial good is the good of love to the Lord, and spiritual good is the good of charity towards the neighbour, <a href="9277.htm">9277</a>. In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
He who trusts in Me will inherit 
the land, and will possess by inheritance My holy mountain. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2057:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 57:13</a>.

<p><b>[5]</b>
 From all this it is evident what was meant by the division of the land of Canaan into twelve inheritances for the twelve 
tribes of Israel, in Chapters <a href="14.htm">14</a>-<a href="19.htm">19</a> of Joshua, and in Chapter 47:13-end and Chapter <a href="48.htm">48</a> of Ezekiel. For 'the land of Canaan' meant the Lord's kingdom, or heaven, <a href="1413.htm">1413</a>, <a href="1437.htm">1437</a>, <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>, <a href="1866.htm">1866</a>, <a href="3038.htm">3038</a>, <a href="3481.htm">3481</a>, <a href="3686.htm">3686</a>, <a href="3705.htm">3705</a>, <a href="4240.htm">4240</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>, and 'the twelve tribes' meant all forms of good and all truths in general and in particular, <a href="3858.htm">3858</a>, <a href="3862.htm">3862</a>, <a href="3926.htm">3926</a>, <a href="3939.htm">3939</a>, <a href="4060.htm">4060</a>, <a href="6335.htm">6335</a>, <a href="6337.htm">6337</a>, <a href="6397.htm">6397</a>, <a href="6640.htm">6640</a>. 'Twelve inheritances' accordingly 
meant heaven with all its heavens and communities, which divide off one from the next on the basis of forms of the good of love and consequently of truths of faith, <a href="7836.htm">7836</a>, <a href="7891.htm">7891</a>, <a href="7996.htm">7996</a>, so that in 
the abstract sense [without reference to persons] those inheritances mean forms of good themselves which originate in the Lord and therefore are the Lord in heaven. </p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 For heaven is nothing other than 
Divine Truth emanating from the Lord's Divine Good. The angels there are recipients of truth in good; and in the measure that they receive it they constitute heaven. Also - and this is an arcanum 
- the Lord dwells with an angel, and similarly with man, only in that which is His own with the angel or man; for the Divine must dwell in what is of God, not in what is of the self with anyone. This 
is meant by the Lord's words regarding His union with those governed by the good of love, in John,  </p>
<p>On that day you will know that I am in the Father, and you in Me, and I in you. He who loves Me keeps 
My word, and We will come to him and make Our home with him. John 14:20, <a href="23.htm">23</a>.  </p>
<p>And elsewhere in the same gospel,  </p>
<p>The glory which You have given Me I have given to them that they may be one 
even as We are one, that the love with which You loved Me may be in them, and I in them. John 17:22, <a href="26.htm">26</a>.  </p>
