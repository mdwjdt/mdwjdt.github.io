<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1071节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1071.</strong>“他喝了酒”表他渴望探究信的问题。这一点从“酒”的含义清楚可知。如前所述，“葡萄园”或“葡萄树”就是属灵教会，或属灵教会成员。而“葡萄”、“簇簇葡萄”和“串串葡萄”是它的果子，这些表仁爱和属仁爱之物。但“酒”表源于仁之信，以及属于信的所有事物。因此，“葡萄”是教会属天的那一面，而“酒”是教会属灵的那一面。如前面频繁所说的，属天的那一面构成意愿，而属灵的那一面则构成觉知。“他喝了酒”表他渴望探究信的问题，并通过推理来探究。这一点从他喝醉了，即陷入错误明显可知。因为该教会成员并没有上古教会成员所拥有的那种直觉，他们不得不通过信的教义事物学习何为善与真，这信的教义事物是从上古教会的感知那里搜集和保存下来的，这些教义事物构成古教会的圣言。和圣言一样，在很多情况下，信的教义事物就是诸如没有感知就不会被相信的那一类；因为属灵和属天之物无限超越人的领悟力，因此才会出现推理。但是，如前面经常所说的，人若不理解就不相信它们，就永远无法相信（参看<a href="128.htm">128</a>-<a href="130.htm">130</a>，<a href="195.htm">195</a>，<a href="196.htm">196</a>，<a href="215.htm">215</a>，<a href="232.htm">232</a>，<a href="233.htm">233</a>节）。<br />在圣言中，“葡萄”表仁爱和属仁爱之物，“酒”表源于仁之信和属信之物，这一点从以下经文明显可知，以赛亚书：<br />我所亲爱的有葡萄园在肥美的山冈上。祂指望结好葡萄，反倒结了野葡萄。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.1.htm">5:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.4.htm">4</a>）<br />此处“葡萄”表仁爱和仁爱的果子。耶利米书：<br />耶和华说，我必彻底收拾他们。葡萄树上必没有葡萄，无花果树上必没有无花果。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶8.13.htm">8:13</a>）<br />“葡萄树”表属灵教会，“葡萄”表仁爱。何西阿书：<br />我遇见以色列如葡萄在旷野，我看见你们的列祖如无花果树上春季初熟的果子。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何9.10.htm">9:10</a>）<br />“以色列”表古教会，“葡萄”表他们被赋予仁爱的事实。当“以色列”表雅各的儿子时，这些话的意思是相反的。弥迦书：<br />没有一挂可吃的；我的灵魂渴想初熟的果子。地上虔诚人灭尽，人间也没有正直的人。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥7.1.htm">7:1</a>）<br />“一挂”表仁爱，或神圣之物，“初熟的果子”表信或正直之物。<br />以赛亚书：<br />耶和华如此说，累累葡萄中寻得新酒，人就说，不要毁坏，因为福在其中。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.8.htm">65:8</a>）<br />“累累葡萄”表仁爱，“新酒”表仁之善和由此而来的信。摩西五经：<br />他在葡萄酒中洗了衣服，在葡萄汁中洗了袍褂。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.11.htm">49:11</a>）<br />这是关于主的一个预言。“葡萄酒”表源于属天之物的属灵之物，“葡萄汁”表属灵教会的属天一面。所以，“葡萄”表仁爱本身，而“酒”表信本身。启示录：<br />又有一位天使说，伸出快镰刀来！收取地上葡萄树的果子，因为葡萄熟透了。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.18.htm">14:18</a>）<br />这论及没有信，即没有仁爱的末世。因为信只属于仁爱，本质上就是仁爱本身。所以，当说不再有信时，如末世时的情形，意思是说没有仁爱。<br />由于“葡萄”表仁，故“酒”表源仁之信，因为酒是从葡萄中获得的。除了关于葡萄园和葡萄酒的这些及之前引用的经文，以下经文也会使这一点变得清晰，以赛亚书：<br />从迦密山（Carmel）中夺去了欢喜快乐，在葡萄园里必无歌唱，也无欢呼的声音。踹酒的在酒榨中不得踹出酒来，我使他欢呼的声音止息。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛16.10.htm">16:10</a>）<br />这表“迦密山”所指的属灵教会已荒凉的事实，“踹酒的在酒榨中不得踹出酒来”表不再有拥有信之人的事实。同一先知书：<br />地上的居民被火焚烧，剩下的人稀少。新酒悲哀，葡萄树衰残；他们必不得饮酒唱歌，喝浓酒的，必以为苦；在街上因酒有呼喊之声。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.6.htm">24:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.11.htm">11</a>）<br />这论述的是荒凉的属灵教会，“酒”表被视为毫无价值的信之真理。耶利米哀歌：<br />那时，他们发昏，好像在城内街上奔跑的，对母亲说：“谷、酒在哪里呢？（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.12.htm">2:12</a>）<br />“谷、酒在哪里呢？”表爱和信在哪里呢？“城内街上”在此和圣言别处一样，表真理。“在城内街上奔跑的”表他们不知道何为信之真理。<br />阿摩司书：<br />我必使我民以色列被掳的归回，他们必重修荒废的城邑居住，栽种葡萄园，喝其中所出的酒。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩9.14.htm">9:14</a>）<br />这论及属灵教会，或“栽种葡萄园，喝其中所出的酒”所指的以色列，这时它变成诸如通过仁而拥有信的教会。西番雅书：<br />他们必建造房屋，却不得住在其内；栽种葡萄园，却不得喝所出的酒。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番1.13.htm">1:13</a>；阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩5.11.htm">5:11</a>）<br />此处“葡萄园”和“葡萄酒”表相反的情况，这时属灵教会已荒凉。撒迦利亚书：<br />以法莲人必如勇士，他们心中畅快如同喝酒，他们的儿子必看见而快活。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚10.7.htm">10:7</a>）<br />这论及犹大家，它凭着信之善与真必变得如此。启示录中不可糟蹋油和酒的命令（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.6.htm">6:6</a>）表不损害属天和属灵之物，即爱和信之物。<br />在犹太教会中，由于“酒”表对主的信，故献祭时奠祭的酒也象征信（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.2.htm">15:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.15.htm">15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.11.htm">28:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.15.htm">15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.18.htm">18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.31.htm">31</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.7.htm">29:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.39.htm">39</a>；利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.12.htm">23:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.13.htm">13</a>；出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.40.htm">29:40</a>）。<br />故而在何西阿书，经上说：<br />打谷场和榨酒池不能喂养他们，新酒也必使她失望。他们必不得住耶和华的陆地，以法莲却要归回埃及，必在亚述吃不洁之物。他们必不得向耶和华奠酒，即便奠酒，也不蒙祂悦纳。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何9.2.htm">9:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何9.4.htm">4</a>）<br />这论及以色列，或属灵教会和其中那些因渴望凭知识和推理探究信的神圣事物和真理而败坏和玷污它们的人。“埃及”是知道，“亚述”是推理，“以法莲”是推理之人。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1071.</strong> The fact that he drank wine means that they wanted to explore religious questions can be seen from the symbolism of wine. A vineyard or grapevine, as shown, is a spiritual religion, or the people of a spiritual church. Grapes, and clusters and bunches of grapes, are its fruit, and they symbolize charity and the effects of charity. Wine, though, symbolizes the faith that grows out of charity, and everything that goes to make up faith. So a grape is the heavenly side of that church, while wine is the spiritual side. The former — the heavenly part — belongs to the will, as noted so often before, while the latter — the spiritual part — belongs to the intellect.{*1} The fact that he drank some wine means that they wanted to explore religious questions, and do so by the use of false reasoning, can be seen from the circumstance that he became drunk, which is to say that they fell into error.<br />The people of this church did not have the perception that the people of the earliest church had. They needed instead to learn what was good and true by studying religious teachings that had been gathered from the perceptions of the earliest church and saved up — teachings that were their Word. Like the Word, these religious teachings in many areas were such that they could not be believed in the absence of perception, because spiritual and heavenly matters rise infinitely beyond human comprehension. That was the reason for their use of skewed reasoning. But people who refuse to believe a thing unless they grasp it [with the senses] are completely incapable of believing, as has been demonstrated many times already; see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_128" target=_top>128</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_129" target=_top>129</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_130" target=_top>130</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_195" target=_top>195</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_196" target=_top>196</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_215" target=_top>215</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_232" target=_top>232</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_233" target=_top>233</a>.<br />[2] The symbolism in the Word of grapes as charity and all it entails, and that of wine as the resulting faith and all it entails, can be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah:<br />My beloved had a vineyard, on a horn of the offspring of oil; he waited for it to produce grapes, and it produced wild grapes. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_5_1-2" target=_top>Isaiah 5:1-2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_5_4" target=_top>4</a>)<br />The grapes stand for charity and its fruits. In Jeremiah:<br />"I will utterly destroy them," says Jehovah. "There are no grapes on the grapevine and no figs on the fig tree." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_8_13" target=_top>Jeremiah 8:13</a>)<br />The grapevine stands for a spiritual religion and the grapes for charity. In Hosea:<br />Israel was like grapes in the wilderness when I discovered him. Your ancestors were like first fruit on a young fig tree when I saw them. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/bible_king-james-version_hosea_9_10" target=_top>Hosea 9:10</a>)<br />Israel stands for the ancient church, a grape for the fact that its people possessed the gift of charity. The meaning is just the opposite when Israel refers to Jacob's children.{*2} In Micah:<br />There is no cluster of grapes to eat; an early [fig] is what my soul has desired. The godly person has perished off the earth, and an upright person does not exist among humankind. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/bible_king-james-version_micah_7_1-2" target=_top>Micah 7:1-2</a>)<br />The cluster of grapes stands for charity, or a godly quality, while the early fruit stands for faith, or what is upright.<br />[3] In Isaiah:<br />This is what Jehovah has said: "Just as new wine is found in the cluster, and they say, ‘Do not spoil it, because there is a blessing in it' ..." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_65_8" target=_top>Isaiah 65:8</a>)<br />The cluster stands for charity, the new wine for the good effects of charity and the truth that they lead to. In Moses:<br />He washed his clothing in wine and his robe in the blood of grapes. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/bible_king-james-version_genesis_49_11" target=_top>Genesis 49:11</a>)<br />This prophesies of the Lord. The wine stands for a spiritual element that comes from a heavenly one, and the blood of grapes, for that which plays a heavenly role in spiritual religions. So the grapes stand for charity itself and the wine for faith itself. In John:<br />The angel said, "Send in the sharp sickle and harvest the earth's clusters, because its grapes have ripened." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/bible_king-james-version_revelation_14_18" target=_top>Revelation 14:18</a>)<br />This is about the final days, when there is no faith — that is, no charity. After all, there is no faith other than the faith that belongs to charity; in its essence, faith is charity. So when the statement is made that there is no longer any faith (as is true in the final days), it means that there is no charity.<br />[4] Just as grapes symbolize charity, wine symbolizes the faith that develops out of charity, since wine comes from grapes. In addition to the passages speaking of vineyards and grapevines cited here and earlier, the following quotations will demonstrate this fact. In Isaiah:<br />Gladness and exultation have been taken away from Carmel,{*3} and in the vineyards there is no singing, no jubilation. No treader treads the wine in the winepresses. I have put an end to the hedad.{*4} (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_16_10" target=_top>Isaiah 16:10</a>)<br />This stands for the fact that the spiritual church (Carmel) has been devastated. "No one to tread the wine in the winepresses" stands for the fact that there is no longer anyone with faith. In the same author:<br />The inhabitants of the land will be destroyed by fire, and the humanity left behind will be a pittance. The new wine will mourn; the grapevine will droop; they will not drink wine with a song. The strong drink will be bitter for those drinking it. A shouting over the wine in the streets! (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_24_6-7" target=_top>Isaiah 24:6-7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_24_9" target=_top>9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_24_11" target=_top>11</a>)<br />These verses deal with a spiritual church that has been devastated. The wine stands for religious truth held cheap. In Jeremiah:{*5} To their mothers they will say, "Where is the grain and the wine?" when they swoon as if stabbed, in the city's streets. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/bible_king-james-version_lamentations_2_12" target=_top>Lamentations 2:12</a>)<br />"Where are the grain and the wine?" means "Where are love and faith?" City streets symbolize truths here, as they do elsewhere in the Word. Lying stabbed in the streets means that they do not know what truth to believe in.<br />[5] In Amos:<br />I will bring my people Israel back from captivity and they will rebuild the ruined cities and settle down and plant vineyards and drink wine from them. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/bible_king-james-version_amos_9_14" target=_top>Amos 9:14</a>)<br />This is about a spiritual religion, or Israel, which is said to plant vineyards and drink wine when it is the kind of religion whose faith is inspired by charity. In Zephaniah:<br />They will build houses but not live in them, and plant vineyards but not drink wine from them. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/bible_king-james-version_zephaniah_1_13" target=_top>Zephaniah 1:13</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/bible_king-james-version_amos_5_11" target=_top>Amos 5:11</a>)<br />This stands for the opposite situation, in which a spiritual religion has been devastated. In Zechariah:<br />They will be like mighty Ephraim, and their heart will rejoice as if with wine, and their children will see and rejoice. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/bible_king-james-version_zechariah_10_7" target=_top>Zechariah 10:7</a>)<br />This is about the house of Judah, which would be as described because of the goodness and truth that characterize faith. In John:<br />... that they should not hurt the oil or the wine. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/bible_king-james-version_revelation_6_6" target=_top>Revelation 6:6</a>)<br />This stands for not hurting anything heavenly or spiritual, which is to say, any attributes of love and faith.<br />[6] Since wine symbolizes faith in the Lord, in the sacrifices of the Jewish religion faith was also represented by a libation of wine, as described in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/bible_king-james-version_numbers_15_2-15" target=_top>Numbers 15:2-15</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/bible_king-james-version_numbers_28_11-15" target=_top>28:11-15</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/bible_king-james-version_numbers_28_18" target=_top>18</a>-end; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/bible_king-james-version_numbers_29_7" target=_top>29:7</a>-end; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_23_12-13" target=_top>Leviticus 23:12-13</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/bible_king-james-version_exodus_29_40" target=_top>Exodus 29:40</a>. As a result, these words appear in Hosea:<br />Threshing floor and winepress will not feed them, and the new wine will prove false in that [land]. They will not live in Jehovah's land, and Ephraim will return to Egypt, and in Assyria they will eat what is unclean. They will not pour a libation of wine to Jehovah; [their libations] will not be pleasing to him. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/bible_king-james-version_hosea_9_2-3" target=_top>Hosea 9:2-3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/bible_king-james-version_hosea_9_4" target=_top>4</a>)<br />In this case the discussion concerns Israel, or a spiritual religion, and those in it who pervert and defile the sanctity and truth of faith through their desire to investigate such things by the use of secular knowledge and sophistry. Egypt is factual knowledge, Assyria is sophistry, and Ephraim is those who engage in it.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the association of heavenliness with the will and of spirituality with the intellect, see, for instance, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_52" target=_top>52-54</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_61" target=_top>61</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_142" target=_top>142</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_310" target=_top>310</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_793" target=_top>793</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_996#subsection-2-2" target=_top>996:2</a>.

And he drank of the wine. That this signifies that he desired to investigate the things which are of faith, is evident from the signification of "wine." The "vineyard" or the "vine" as has been shown, 
is the spiritual church, or the man of the spiritual church; the "grape" "bunches" and "clusters" are its fruit, and signify charity and what is of charity. But "wine" signifies the faith thence derived, 
and all things that belong to it. Thus the "grape" is the celestial of that church, and the "wine" is the spiritual of that church. The former, or the celestial, is of the will, as has been said 
before; the latter, or the spiritual, is of the understanding. That his "drinking of the wine" signifies that he desired to investigate the things of faith, and this by reasonings, is evident from his 
becoming drunken, that is, fallen into errors. For the man of this church had no perception, as had the man of the Most Ancient Church, but had to learn what was good and true from the doctrinal things 
of faith collected and preserved from the perception of the Most Ancient Church, which doctrinal things were the Word of the Ancient Church. Like the Word, the doctrinal things of faith were in many 
cases such as without perception could not be believed; for spiritual and celestial things infinitely transcend human apprehension, and hence arises reasoning. But he who will not believe them until 
he apprehends them, can never believe, as has been often shown before. (See n. 128-130, 195, 196, 215, 232, 233.) [2] That "grapes" in the Word signify charity and what is of charity, and that "wine" 
signifies the faith thence derived and the things that belong to it, is evident from the following passages. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     My beloved had a vineyard in a horn of the son of oil, and he looked that 
it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes (Isa. 5:1-2, 4),  where "grapes" denote charity and its fruits. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Gathering I will gather them, saith Jehovah; there 
shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree (Jer. 8:13), where the "vine" denotes the spiritual church; "grapes" charity. In Hosea: </p>
<p>     I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I 
saw your fathers as the first-ripe in the fig-tree, at the beginning (Hos. 9:10). "Israel" denotes the Ancient Church; "grapes" its being endued with charity. The sense is opposite when "Israel" denotes 
the sons of Jacob. In Micah: </p>
<p>     There is no cluster to eat; my soul desireth the first-ripe fig. The holy man is perished out of the earth, and there is none upright among men (Micah 7:1). "Cluster" 
denotes charity, or what is holy; "first-ripe fig" faith, or what is right.  [3] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Thus saith Jehovah, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not, for 
a blessing is in it (Isa. 65:8); </p>
<p>where "cluster" denotes charity, and "new wine" the goods of charity and the truths thence derived. In Moses: </p>
<p>     He washed His garment in wine, and His vesture in 
the blood of grapes (Gen. 49:11); </p>
<p>a prophecy relating to the Lord. "Wine" denotes the spiritual from the celestial, the "blood of grapes" the celestial relatively to spiritual churches. Thus "grapes" 
denote charity itself, "wine" faith itself. In John: </p>
<p>     The angel said, Put forth thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe (Rev. 14:18). Here 
the subject is the last times when there is no faith, that is, when there is no charity; for faith is no other than of charity, and essentially is charity itself; so that when it is said that there 
is no longer any faith, as in the last times, it is meant that there is no charity.  [4] As "grapes" signify charity, so "wine" signifies the faith thence derived, for wine is from grapes. This will 
be evident from the passages already cited about the vineyard and the vine, and also from the following. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Gladness is taken away, and exultation, from Carmel; and in the vineyards 
there shall be no singing, neither joyful noise; no treader shall tread out wine in the presses; I have made the vintage shout to cease (Isa. 16:10), meaning that the spiritual church, which is "Carmel" 
is vastated; "not treading out wine in the presses" means that there are no longer any who are in faith. Again: </p>
<p>     The inhabitants of the earth are burned, and man shall be left feeble; the new 
wine shall mourn, the vine shall languish; they shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it; there is a crying in the streets because of the wine (Isa. 24:6-7, 
9, 11).The subject here is the vastated church, and "wine" denotes the truths of faith, there held to be of no value. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     They will say to their mothers, where is the corn and the wine? 
when they faint as one wounded in the streets of the city? (Lam. 2:12). "Where is the corn and the wine" signifies where is love and faith; the "streets of the city" signify here, as elsewhere in 
the Word, truths; "being wounded in them" signifies not to know what the truths of faith are.  [5] In Amos: </p>
<p>     I will bring again the captivity of My people Israel, and they shall build the waste 
cities and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof (Amos 9:14). This is said of the spiritual church, or "Israel" of which planting vineyards and drinking the wine thereof 
is predicated, when it becomes such as to have faith from charity. In Zephaniah: </p>
<p>     They shall build houses, but shall not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, but shall not drink the 
wine thereof (Zeph. 1:13; Amos 5:11). Here is described the opposite condition, when the spiritual church is vastated. In Zechariah: </p>
<p>     They shall be as the mighty Ephraim, and their heart shall 
rejoice as through wine; yea, their sons shall see it and be glad (Zech. 10:7); </p>
<p>said of the house of Judah, that it should be such from the goods and truths of faith. In John: </p>
<p>     That they were not 
to hurt the oil and the wine (Rev. 6:6), meant that no injury is to be done to the celestial and the spiritual, or to what is of love and faith.  [6] As "wine" signified faith in the Lord, in the 
Jewish Church faith was represented in the sacrifices by a libation of wine (Num. 15:2-15; 28:11-15, 18-31; 29:7-39; Lev. 23:12-13; Exod. 29:40). Wherefore it is said in Hosea:     The threshing-floor 
and the wine-press shall not feed them, and the new wine shall deceive therein; they shall not dwell in the land of Jehovah; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat what is unclean in 
Assyria; they shall not pour out wine to Jehovah, neither shall [their libations] be pleasing to Him (Hos. 9:2-4). Here the subject is Israel, or the spiritual church, and those in it who pervert and 
defile the holy and true things of faith by desiring to investigate them by means of knowledges and reasonings. "Egypt" is memory-knowledge, "Assyria" reasoning, "Ephraim" one who reasons. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1071</b></p><p><b>1071.</b>
That 'he drank wine' means that he wished to probe into matters of faith is clear from the meaning of 'wine'. 'A vineyard' or 'a vine', as has been shown, is the spiritual Church, or member of the spiritual 
Church. The grape, clusters, and bunches are its fruit, and these mean charity and what belongs to charity. Wine however means faith deriving from charity, and all things that belong to faith. 
Thus 'grape means the celestial aspect of that Church, and 'wine' the spiritual. The celestial, as often stated already, comprises the will, while the spiritual comprises the understanding. That 'he 
drank of the wine' means that he wished to probe into matters of faith, and to do so indeed by means of reasonings, is clear from the reason given why 'he was drunk', that is, sank into errors. Indeed 
the member of this Church did not possess any perception at all as the member of the Most Ancient Church had done. Instead he had to acquire knowledge of what good and truth were by learning about them 
from doctrinal matters concerning faith which had been gathered together and preserved from the perception that had existed in the Most Ancient Church. And these matters of doctrine constituted the 
Word of the Ancient Church. As with the Word, doctrinal matters concerning faith were in many instances such that, without perception, they could not be believed; for spiritual and celestial things infinitely 
transcend human comprehension, and this is why reasoning enters in. But the person who refuses to believe those things until he comprehends them is never able to believe, as often shown already.

<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That 'grapes in the Word means charity and what belongs to charity, and that 'wine' means both faith deriving from charity and also matters 
of faith, becomes clear from the following places: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
My beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> He looked for it to yield grapes, and it yielded wild grapes. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%205:1,%202,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 5:1, 2, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 
'grapes' stands for charity and the fruits of charity. In Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will surely gather them, says Jehovah; there will be no grapes on the vine nor figs on the fig tree. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%208:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 8:13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Vine' 
stands for the spiritual Church, 'grapes' for charity. In Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
 Like grapes in the wilderness I found Israel, like the first fruit on the fig tree, in the beginning, I saw your fathers. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%209:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 9:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Israel' stands for the Ancient Church, 'grape' for the fact that they were endowed with charity. These words are used in the contrary sense when 'Israel' stands for the sons of Jacob. In Micah, There 
was no cluster to eat; my soul desired the first fruit. The holy man has perished from the earth, and there is none upright among men. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Micah%207:1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Micah 7:1, 2</a>. </p>
<p>'Cluster' stands for charity or that 
which is holy, 'first fruit' for faith or that which is upright. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said Jehovah, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one says, Do not destroy it, for there is a blessing 
in it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2065:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 65:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Cluster' stands for charity, 'new wine' for goods that stem from charity, and truths deriving from these. In Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
He washes his clothing in wine, and His garment in the 
blood of grapes. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2049:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 49:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This is a prophecy concerning the Lord. 'Wine' stands for that which is spiritual deriving from what is celestial, 'blood of grapes' for the celestial in respect to spiritual 
Churches. So 'grapes' stands for charity itself, 'wine' for faith itself. In John, </p>
<blockquote>
The angel said, Put in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the earth, for its grapes have ripened. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2014:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 14:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the last times when there is no faith, that is, when there is no charity. For no faith exists other than that which inheres in charity, and in essence is charity itself. 
Consequently when it is said that there is no longer any faith, as in the last times, it means that there is no charity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 As 'grapes' means charity, so 'wine' means faith deriving from charity, 
for wine is obtained from grapes. In addition to these and previous quotations concerning the vineyard and the vine, the following also make the point clear: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Gladness and exaltation have 
been taken away from Carmel, and in the vineyards there is no singing, no joyful noise. No treader treads out wine in the presses; I have made the hedad<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> to cease. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2016:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 16:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This stands for 
the fact that the spiritual Church, meant by 'Carmel', has been vastated, 'none treading wine in the presses' for the fact that no longer are there any people who possess faith. In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
The 
inhabitants of the earth will be scorched and few men left. The new wine will mourn, the vine will languish; they will not drink wine with singing, strong drink will be bitter to those drinking 
it; there will be an outcry in the streets over wine. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2024:6,%207,%209,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 24:6, 7, 9, 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The vastated spiritual Church being the subject, 'wine' stands for truths of faith that are considered valueless. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
They 
will say to their mothers, Where is corn and wine? when they faint like one who has been run through in the streets of the city. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lam%202:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lam 2:12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Where is corn and wine?' means, Where is love 
and faith? 'Streets of the city' means truths here, as elsewhere in the Word. 'Those who have been run through in them' means that they do not know what the truths of faith are. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Amos, </p>
<blockquote>
I 
will bring again the captivity of My people Israel, and they will build the ruined cities and inhabit them. And they will plant vineyards and drink their wine. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%209:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 9:14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the spiritual 
Church, meant by Israel, to which 'planting vineyards and drinking wine' is attributed when it becomes a Church such as derives faith from charity. In Zephaniah, </p>
<blockquote>
They will build houses but not 
inhabit them, and they will plant vineyards but not drink their wine. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zeph%201:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zeph 1:13</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%205:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 5:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'vineyard' and 'wine' stand for the contrary situation when the spiritual Church has been vastated. 
In Zechariah,  </p>
<blockquote>
They will be like a mighty man of Ephraim, and their heart will rejoice as from wine, and their sons will see it and rejoice. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%2010:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 10:7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
This refers to the house of Judah, that 
it would be such by virtue of the goods and truths of faith. In John the command not to do harm to oil and wine, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%206:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 6:6</a>, stands for doing no harm to what is celestial and spiritual, that is, to things 
of love and faith. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In the Jewish Church, since 'wine' meant faith in the Lord, the libation of wine in the sacrifices also represented faith, as in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2015:1-15;%2028:11-15,%2018-end;%2029:7-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 15:1-15; 28:11-15, 18-end; 29:7-end</a>; 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2023:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 23:12, 13</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2029:40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 29:40</a>. 
</blockquote>
Hence the following is said in Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
Threshing-floor and winepress will not feed them, and new wine will be deceptive in her. They will not dwell in Jehovah's land, 
but Ephraim will return to Egypt, and in Assyria they will eat what is unclean: They will not pour libations of wine to Jehovah, they will not be pleasing to Him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%209:1-4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 9:1-4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Israel, 
or the spiritual Church, and to those people in it who pervert and defile holy things and the truths of faith by wishing to probe into them by means of knowledge and reasonings. 'Egypt' is knowledge, 
'Assyria' reasoning, and 'Ephraim' one who engages in reasoning.

estque essentialiter ipsa charitas, quare cum dicitur quod amplius nulla fides, ut ultimis temporibus, intelligitur quod nulla charitas. [4] Sicut 'uvae' significant charitatem, ita 'vinum'
