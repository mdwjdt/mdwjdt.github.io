<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1232.</strong>“亚兰”表对良善的认知。这可从前面所述，以及圣言推知，如以西结书：<br />亚兰人因你的货品繁多，就作你的客商；他们用绿宝石、紫色布、绣货、细麻布、珊瑚、红宝石兑换你的货物。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.16.htm">27:16</a>）<br />这论及推罗，或拥有认知。“货品、绿宝石、紫色布、绣货、细麻布、珊瑚、红宝石”在此无非表对良善的认知。何西阿书：<br />从前雅各逃到亚兰的田野，以色列为得妻服侍人，为得妻与人放羊。耶和华借先知领以色列从埃及上来，以色列也藉先知而得保存。以法莲大大惹动主怒。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何12.12.htm">12:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何12.14.htm">14</a>）<br />此处“雅各”表外在教会，“以色列”表内在属灵教会。“亚兰”表对良善的认知，“埃及”表败坏的知识，“以法莲”表败坏的聪明才智。在此上下文中，这些所表示的意思无法从字义看出来，只能通过内义推知，这些名字的内义表教会的真实事物，如前所述。以赛亚书：<br />看哪，大马士革已被废弃，不再为城，必变作废墟。以法莲不再有保障，大马士革不再有国权；亚兰所剩下的，必像以色列人的荣耀。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛17.1.htm">17:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛17.3.htm">3</a>）<br />“亚兰所剩下的”在此表对良善的认知，它们被称为“以色列的荣耀”。“亚兰”或叙利亚在反面意义上表对已败坏的良善的认知。一个词具有（好与坏）两方面的意义，这在圣言中是常有的事（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛7.4.htm">7:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛7.6.htm">6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.11.htm">9:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.12.htm">12</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申26.5.htm">26:5</a>）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1232.</strong> The symbolism of Aram, or Syria, as knowledge of what is good follows logically. It also follows from what the Word says. In Ezekiel:<br />Aram was your dealer for the abundance of your works in chrysoprase, red-violet fabric, and embroidery, and fine linen, and ramoth, and carnelian;{*1} they traded for your market goods. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1232/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_27_16" target=_top>Ezekiel 27:16</a>)<br />This is about Tyre, or in other words, about acquiring knowledge. The works, chrysoprase, red-violet fabric, embroidery, fine linen, ramoth, and carnelian mean nothing else than a knowledge of goodness. In Hosea:<br />Jacob fled into the field of Aram and worked as a servant in exchange for a wife, and for a wife he guarded [sheep]. And through a prophet Jehovah brought Israel up out of Egypt, and through a prophet [Israel] was kept safe. Ephraim provoked [Jehovah] to bitter anger. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1232/bible_king-james-version_hosea_12_12-13" target=_top>Hosea 12:12-13</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1232/bible_king-james-version_hosea_12_14" target=_top>14</a>)<br />Jacob stands for the outer church here, and Israel stands for the inner, spiritual church. Aram stands for a knowledge of goodness. Egypt stands for secular learning that corrupts. Ephraim stands for intelligence that has been corrupted. What they symbolize within the series could never be deduced from the literal meaning, only from the inner sense, in which names symbolize various phenomena in the church, as noted [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1232/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_64" target=_top>64</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1232/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_144" target=_top>144-145</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1232/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_339" target=_top>339</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1232/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_468" target=_top>468:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1232/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1143" target=_top>1143</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1232/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1224" target=_top>1224</a>]. In Isaiah:<br />Here now, Damascus has been rejected as a city and become a heap of ruin. The stronghold will disappear from Ephraim and the sovereignty from Damascus,{*2} and the remainder of Aram will be like the glory of the children of Israel. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1232/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_17_1" target=_top>Isaiah 17:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1232/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_17_3" target=_top>3</a>)<br />The remainder of Aram stands for a knowledge of goodness, which is called Israel's glory. Aram (or Syria) in the opposite sense also stands for a knowledge of goodness that has been perverted, in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1232/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_7_4" target=_top>Isaiah 7:4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1232/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_7_5" target=_top>5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1232/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_7_6" target=_top>6</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1232/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_9_12" target=_top>9:12</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1232/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_26_5" target=_top>Deuteronomy 26:5</a>. (In the Word it is common for a word to be used in both senses.)<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Chrysoprase is a green, transparent quartz gemstone. The word "ramoth," which appears both here and in Swedenborg's original Latin, is a transliteration of the Hebrew word used in this biblical passage, רָאמֹת (rāmōṯ); its meaning is uncertain. Generally it is thought to be coral, although some scholars think it may be pearls or murex, a shellfish that was crushed to obtain purple dye. Carnelian is a reddish chalcedony gemstone. [LHC, RS, SS]<br />{*2} Swedenborg emphasizes Damascus here because "Aram" is Syria and Damascus was Syria's chief city (as it still is). [LHC] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1232</b></p><p><b>1232.</b>
That by "Aram," or Syria, are signified the knowledges of good, follows; and is seen also from the Word, as in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Aram was thy trader, in the multitude of thy works; in chrysoprase, crimson, 
and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and carbuncle; they gave them in thy tradings (Ezek. 27:16), where Tyre is treated of, or the possession of knowledges; and "works, chrysoprase, crimson, 
broidered work, fine linen, coral, and carbuncle," here signify nothing else than the knowledges of good. In Hosea: </p>
<p>     Jacob fled into the field of Aram, and Israel served for a wife, and for 
a wife he kept guard; and by a prophet Jehovah brought Israel up out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he kept. Ephraim hath provoked to anger with bitternesses (Hos. 12:12-14). "Jacob" here denotes the 
external church, and "Israel," the internal spiritual church; "Aram," the knowledges of good; "Egypt," memory-knowledge that perverts; "Ephraim," intelligence perverted. What these signify in series 
cannot be seen from the literal sense, but only from the internal sense, where names signify actual things of the church, as has been said. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>Behold Damascus is rejected from being a city, 
and is become a ruinous heap. The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Aram shall be as the glory of the sons of Israel (Isa. 17:1, 3). "The remnant 
of Aram" here denotes the knowledges of good, which are called "the glory of Israel." "Aram," or Syria, in the opposite sense, denotes the knowledges of good perverted; for it is a usual thing in the 
Word that the expressions are used in both senses (Isa. 7:4-6; 9:11-12; Deut. 26:5). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1232</b></p><p><b>1232.</b>
That 'Aram' or Syria means cognitions of good follows from what has been said above as well as from the Word: in Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Aram was your merchant in the multitude of your handiworks; they exchanged 
for your wares chrysoprase, purple, and embroidered work, and fine linen, and ramoth,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and rubies. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2027:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 27:16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to 'Tyre' or the possession of cognitions. Here 'handiworks, chrysoprase, 
purple, embroidered work, fine linen, ramoth, and rubies' means nothing else than cognitions of good. In Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
Jacob fled into the field of Aram and served for a wife, and for a wife kept guard. 
And by a prophet Jehovah brought Israel up out of Egypt, and by a prophet he was preserved. Ephraim has provoked to anger most bitterly. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%2012:12-14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 12:12-14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'Jacob' stands for the external Church, 
and 'Israel' for the internal spiritual Church. 'Aram' stands for cognitions of good, 'Egypt' for knowledge that debases, 'Ephraim' for debased intelligence. What these mean in this context cannot possibly 
be deduced from the literal sense, only from the internal sense where, as has been stated, names mean things of the Church. In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, Damascus has been rejected so that it is not a 
city; it has become a heap of ruins. The fortress will disappear from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus; and the remnant of Aram will be like the glory of the children of Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2017:1,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 17:1, 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 
'the remnant of Aram' stands for cognitions of good which are called 'the glory of Israel'. 'Aram' or Syria also stands in the contrary sense for cognitions of good that have been debased, for 
it is usual in the Word for an expression to be used in both senses, see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%207:4-6;%209:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 7:4-6; 9:12</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2026:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 26:5</a>.
