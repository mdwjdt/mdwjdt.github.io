<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5504.</strong>创世记42:29-34.他们来到迦南地，他们的父亲雅各那里，将他们所遭遇的事都告诉他，说，那地的主人对我们说严厉的话，把我们当作窥探那地的奸细。我们对他说，我们是诚实人，并不是奸细。我们本是弟兄十二人，都是我们父亲的儿子，有一个不在了，最小的今日同我们的父亲在迦南地。那地的主人对我们说，只有这样我才知道你们是诚实人：留你们兄弟中的一个在我这里，你们可以带着粮食去，救你们家里的饥荒。把你们最小的兄弟带到我这里来，我便知道你们不是奸细，乃是诚实人。这样，我就把你们的弟兄交给你们，你们也可以在这地到处作买卖。<br />“他们来到”表随后的改造状态。“他们的父亲雅各那里”表属世真理的良善。“迦南地”表属于教会的东西。“将他们所遭遇的事都告诉他”表那真理的良善对直到那时所提供的事物的反思。“说”表觉知。“那地的主人说”表在属世层中掌权的属灵层的属天层。“对我们严厉的话”表因没有一致性而未与该层联结。“把我们当作窥探那地的奸细”表它发现教会的真理是为寻求利益而存在的。“我们对他说，我们是诚实人，并不是奸细”表否认他们是为了利益而对教会的真理感兴趣。“我们本是弟兄十二人”表在一个整体中的一切真理。“都是我们父亲的儿子”表拥有同一个源头。“有一个不在了”表神性属灵层（它们的联结就是从神性属灵层开始的）没有显现。“最小的今日同我们的父亲在迦南地”表从它自己（即属灵层的属天层）拥有与属灵良善的联结。“那地的主人对我们说”表对在属世层中掌权的属灵层的属天层的觉知。“只有这样我才知道你们是诚实人”表它的意愿，前提是他们不是为了利益而对真理感兴趣。“留你们兄弟中的一个在我这里”表意愿中的信要与它们分离。“你们可以带着粮食，救你们家里的饥荒”表在此期间，他们可以在那荒凉之地提供自己所需的。“去”表好叫它们由此可以生活。“把你们最小的兄弟带到我这里来”表若有一个居间层，就会有联结。“我便知道你们不是奸细”表那时真理不再是为了利益，或说它们不再是为利益而存在的真理。“乃是诚实人”表一致性因此而存在。“这样，我就把你们的弟兄交给你们”表这样真理就会变成良善。“你们也可以在这地到处作买卖”表这样真理将从良善而结实，都会提供某种功用和利益。</p>

Verses 29-34. And they came unto Jacob their father to the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them, saying, The man, the lord of the land, spoke hard things with us, and took us for spies 
of the land. And we said unto him, We are upright; we are no spies; we are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan. And 
the man, the lord of the land, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are upright; let one of your brethren remain with me, and take for the famine of your houses, and go, and bring your youngest 
brother unto me; then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are upright; I will give you your brother, and ye shall go about trading in the land. "And they came," signifies what is successive 
of reformation; "unto Jacob their father," signifies the good of natural truth; "to the land of Canaan," signifies which is of the church; "and told him all that had befallen them," signifies reflection 
from the good of that truth upon the things which were hitherto provided; "saying," signifies perception; "the man, the lord of the land spoke," signifies the celestial of the spiritual reigning in 
the natural; "hard things with us," signifies non-conjunction therewith on account of non-correspondence; "and took us for spies of the land," signifies that it observed that the truths of the church 
were for seeking gain; "and we said unto him, We are upright, we are no spies," signifies denial that they were in the truths of the church for the purpose of gain; "we are twelve brethren," signifies 
all truths in one complex; "sons of our father," signifies of one origin; "one is not," signifies that the Divine spiritual source does not appear; "and the youngest is this day with our father," signifies 
that from him is adjunction to spiritual good; "and the man, the lord of the land, said unto us," signifies perception concerning the celestial of the spiritual reigning in the natural; "Hereby 
shall I know that ye are upright," signifies that it is willing, if they are not in truths for the sake of gain; "let one of your brethren remain with me," signifies that faith in the will should be 
separated from them; "and take for the famine of your houses," signifies that in the meantime they may provide for themselves in that desolation; "and go" signifies that so they may live; "and bring 
your youngest brother unto me," signifies that if there were an intermediate there would be conjunction; "then shall I know that ye are no spies," signifies that then truths would no longer be for the 
purpose of gain; "but that ye are upright," signifies that thus there would be correspondence; "I will give you your brother," signifies that thus truths would become goods; "and ye shall go about trading 
in the land," signifies that thus truths will be made fruitful from good, and will all turn to use and profit. </p>

Verses 29-34 And they came to Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan; and they pointed out to him all that was happening to them, saying, The man, the lord of the land, spoke hard words to us, and 
took us for men spying out the land. And we said to him, We are upright men; we are not spies. Twelve are we, brothers, the sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is today with our father in 
the land of Canaan. And the man, the lord of the land, said to us, By this I shall know that you are upright men: Cause one brother among you to remain with me, and take [food for] the famine of your 
houses, and go. And bring your youngest brother to me, and I shall know that you are not spies, that you are upright men; I will give you your brother, and you will wander through the land, trading. </p>
<p>'And 
they came' means a subsequent state of reformation. 'To Jacob their father' means the good of natural truth. 'To the land of Canaan' means which is that of the Church. 'And they pointed out to 
him all that was happening to them' means reflection made by the good of that truth on what was provided up to then. 'Saying' means perception. 'The man, the lord of the land, spoke' means the celestial 
of the spiritual ruling in the natural. 'Hard words to us' means that no joining together with this took place because no agreement existed. 'And took us for men spying out the land' means that it 
saw the truths known to the Church as ones existing for the sake of gain. 'And we said to him, We are upright men; we are not spies' means a denial that they were interested in the truths known to the 
Church for the sake of gain. 'Twelve are we, brothers' means all truths in their entirety. 'The sons of our father' means having the same origin. 'One is not' means that the Divine spiritual from which 
their joining together begins is not apparent. 'And the youngest is today with our father in the land of Canaan' means that from itself [the celestial of the spiritual] had a link with spiritual 
good. 'And the man, the lord of the land, said to us' means a discernment regarding the celestial of the spiritual ruling in the natural. 'By this I shall know that you are upright men' means its willingness, 
provided that they were not interested in truths for the sake of gain. 'Cause one brother among you to remain with me' means that faith in the will was to be separated from them. 'And take [food 
for] the famine of your houses' means that in the meantime they should provide for their own needs in that desolation. 'And go' means so that they may thereby live. 'And bring your youngest brother 
to me' means that if the intermediary were there the joining together would take place. 'And I shall know that you are not spies' means that they are no longer truths existing for the sake of gain. 
'That you are upright men means that agreement accordingly exists. 'I will give you your brother' means that truths will thereby be made forms of good. 'And you will wander through the land, trading' 
means that truths from good will thereby be made fruitful and will all afford some useful purpose and lead to some form of gain. </p>

Vers.  29-34.  Et venerunt ad Jacobum patrem suum, terram Canaan, et indicabant ei omnia obvenientia illis, dicendo, Locutus vir dominus terrae cum, nobis dura, et dedit nos sicut explorantes terram. 
 Et diximus ad eum, Recti nos, non sumus exploratores. Duodecim nos fratres filii patris nostri, unus non est, et minimus hodie cum patre nostro in terra Canaan.  Et dixit ad nos vir dominus terrae, 
In hoc sciam quod recti vos, fratrem vestrum unum manere facite mecum, et famem domorum vestrarum accipite, et ite. Et adducite fratrem vestrum minimum ad me, et sciam quod non exploratores vos, quod 
recti vos; fratrem vestrum dabo vobis, et terram negotiando pervagabimini.  `Et venerunt' significat successivum reformationis: `ad Jacobum patrem suum' significat bonum veri naturalis: `terram Canaan' 
significat quod est Ecclesiae: `et indicabant ei omnia obvenientia illis' significat reflexionem ex bono veri illius super illa quae hactenus provisa: `dicendo' significat perceptionem: `locutus vir 
dominus terrae' significat caeleste spiritualis regnans in naturali: `cum nobis dura' significat non conjunctionem cum illo ob non correspondentiam: `et dedit nos sicut explorantes terram' significat 
quod animadverterit vera Ecclesiae fuisse ad captandum lucrum: `et diximus ad eum, Recti nos, non sumus exploratores' significat negativum quod in veris Ecclesiae {1} lucri causa: `duodecim nos fratres' 
significat omnia vera in uno complexu: `filii patris nostri' significat ex una origine: `unus non est' significat quod Divinum spirituale a quo, non appareat: `et minimus hodie cum patre nostro in 
terra Canaan {2}' significat quod ab ipso adjunctum sit bono spirituali: `et dixit ad nos vir dominus terrae' significat apperceptionem de caelesti spiritualis regnante in naturali: `In hoc sciam quod 
recti vos' significat quod velit si in veris non propter lucrum: `fratrem vestrum unum manere facite mecum' significat quod separaretur fides voluntate ab illis: `et famem domorum vestrarum accipite' 
significat ut prospiciant sibi interea in desolatione illa: `et ite' significat ut sic vivant: `et adducite fratrem vestrum minimum ad me' significat quod si medium, conjunctio: `et sciam quod non 
exploratores vos' significat quod tunc non amplius vera lucri causa: `quod recti vos' significat quod ita correspondentia: `fratrem vestrum dabo vobis' significat quod ita vera fient bona: `et terram 
negotiando pervagabimini' significat quod ita fructificabuntur vera ex bono et omnia cedent usui et lucro. @1 A o here$ @2 A I o here and 5517; cp above$ </p>
