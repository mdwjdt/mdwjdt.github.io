<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9103节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9103.</strong>“以羊群中的四只赔羊群中的一只”表直到完全的相应惩罚。这从“四”和“羊群中的一只”的含义清楚可知。“四”是指结合，“四”与“二”所表相同，因为四是二乘以二的乘积；“二”表示结合（参看<a href="5194.htm">5194</a>，<a href="8423.htm">8423</a>节），因此“四”也是（参看<a href="1686.htm">1686</a>，<a href="8877.htm">8877</a>节）；由此可推知，这些数字也表示完全或完整的数量，因为结合起来的东西是完整或完全的。“羊群中的一只”是指内层良善，如刚才所述（<a href="9099.htm">9099</a>节）。“赔”，即“以羊群中的四只赔羊群中的一只”表示相应的惩罚（<a href="9102.htm">9102</a>节）。内层良善就是那在内层人中被称为仁的；外层良善则是外层人中的仁。后一种良善必须从前者获得生命，因为内层人中的仁之良善是属灵生命的良善；而外层人中的仁之良善则是源于属灵生命的属世生命的良善。这外层良善作为快乐进入人的感觉，但内层良善不进入感觉，而是进入他的意识，即它当如此的意识，并能使他的心智感到满足。然而，在来世，内层良善或属灵良善也进入一个人的感觉。<br />没有人能知道为何要以五牛还一牛，以羊群中的四只还羊群中的一只，除非他知道“偷”在灵义上表示什么，以及“牛”和“羊群中的一只”又表示什么。这些事物表示什么已经解释过了，即夺走并疏远外层和内层良善。这种夺走是由邪恶造成的，疏远则是由虚假造成的。因此，“五”和“四”表示对它们的惩罚和恢复；因为在圣言中，一切数字都表示属灵事物（参看<a href="575.htm">575</a>，<a href="647.htm">647</a>，<a href="648.htm">648</a>，<a href="755.htm">755</a>，<a href="813.htm">813</a>，<a href="1963.htm">1963</a>，<a href="1988.htm">1988</a>，<a href="2075.htm">2075</a>，<a href="2252.htm">2252</a>，<a href="3252.htm">3252</a>，<a href="4264.htm">4264</a>，<a href="4495.htm">4495</a>，<a href="4670.htm">4670</a>，<a href="5265.htm">5265</a>，<a href="6175.htm">6175</a>节），在此表示与恢复有关的事物。也就是说，数字“五”是指在很大程度上对外层良善的恢复，数字“四”是指对内层良善的完全恢复。内层良善之所以必须完全恢复，是因为该良善构成人的属灵生命；除非属灵生命完全恢复，否则，构成属世生命的外层良善无法被恢复；因为属世生命通过属灵生命来恢复，这从人的重生可以看出来。外在人通过内在人重生（参看<a href="9043.htm">9043</a>，<a href="9046.htm">9046</a>，<a href="9061.htm">9061</a>节）；但外在人或属世人中的良善无法完全恢复，因为它被击打所受的损伤就像一道变硬的疤痕那样留在那里。这些就是这些数字所暗含的事物。<br />然而，还必须简要说一说构成人的属世生命的外层良善通过构成他的属灵生命的内层良善的恢复。人心智的属世层在世界之光中看见事物，这光被称为属世之光。人通过经由视听进入意识的物体，也就是通过从世界所获得的对物体的印象而为自己获得这光。因此，人以其心智的眼睛看见这些物体，几乎与他的肉眼看见它们一样精确。一开始，通过这些感官进入的物体对他来说，都是一种快乐和愉悦。后来，当他还是一个小孩子时，就会区分令他快乐的不同物体，由此学会辨别，并且逐渐辨别得越来越准确。当来自天堂的光流入这些事物时，此人便开始以属灵的眼光看待它们，首先开始区分有用的和无用的。他由此开始清楚地看到真理；因为在他看来，凡对他有用的东西都是真实的，凡没有用的东西都是不真实的。这种看见真理的能力会随着从天堂所流入的光变得更亮而增强，直到最后他不仅区分真理，甚至还区分这些真理中的真理。随着内在人与外在人之间的交流得到改善，并更好地被打开，他做起这种事来愈加清晰；因为天堂之光从主经由内在人流入外在人。现在这个人由此而有了觉知；然而这还不是属灵的觉知。<br />属灵的觉知不是从属世真理，而是从属灵真理中长出来的，属灵真理就是那被称为信之真理的。属灵的觉知之所以从这些真理中长出来，是因为天堂之光就是从主发出的神性真理。这光在天使眼前闪耀，也在他们的理解力中闪耀，赋予他们聪明和智慧，不过照着在良善里面对它的接受而数量不一。因此，如果属灵的觉知要生长，人必须拥有关于属灵事物认知或知识在他的属世人里面，而属灵事物知识必须来自启示。当天堂之光流入这些知识时，它就流入它自己的东西；因为如前所述，这光是从主发出的神性真理（<a href="1053.htm">1053</a>，<a href="1521.htm">1521</a>-<a href="1533.htm">1533</a>，<a href="1619.htm">1619</a>-<a href="1632.htm">1632</a>，<a href="2776.htm">2776</a>，<a href="3138.htm">3138</a>，<a href="3167.htm">3167</a>，<a href="3195.htm">3195</a>，<a href="3222.htm">3222</a>，<a href="3223.htm">3223</a>，<a href="3341.htm">3341</a>，<a href="3636.htm">3636</a>，<a href="3643.htm">3643</a>，<a href="4180.htm">4180</a>，<a href="4302.htm">4302</a>，<a href="4408.htm">4408</a>，<a href="4415.htm">4415</a>，<a href="4527.htm">4527</a>，<a href="5400.htm">5400</a>，<a href="6032.htm">6032</a>，<a href="6313.htm">6313</a>，<a href="6608.htm">6608</a>节）。这就是一个人如何在诸如属于永生的那类事物上获得聪明和智慧；这些聪明、智慧照着接受这光的程度，也就是在良善里面接受信之真理的程度而增长。良善就是仁爱。<br />属世人或外在人通过内在人重生，以及得以修正并恢复，这一点从现在所阐述的可以看出来。外在人或属世人中的事物从天堂之光获得生命；这光是活的，因为它是从主那里发出的，而主是生命本身。它们并不从属世之光获得自己的生命，因为这光本身是死的。因此，如果属世之光中的事物要获得生命，就必须有一个经由内在人从主而来的活光的流注。该流注照着存在于属世层中的类似和对应的真理认知或知识，以及那里能服务或服从的其它事物而调整自己。由此明显可知，人的外在人或属世人必须通过他的内在人重生；属世人中被夺走或疏远的良善必须以同样的方式被修正和恢复。</p>

And four of the flock for one of the flock. That this signifies also the corresponding penalty to the full, is evident from the signification of "four," as being conjunction, for "four" signifies the 
same as "two," because the one number arises from other, being the double of it (that "two" denotes conjunction, see n. 5194, 8423; and consequently also "four," see n. 1686, 8877); from which it follows 
that these numbers also denote to the full, for that which is conjoined is full; and from the signification of "one of the flock," as being interior good, (see just above, n. 9099). The corresponding 
penalty is signified by "repaying," namely, four of the flock for one of the flock (n. 9102). Interior good is that good which is called charity in the interior man; and exterior good is charity 
in the exterior man. The latter good must live from the former, for the good of charity in the interior man is the good of spiritual life; and the good of charity in the exterior man is the good of the 
derivative natural life. The latter good comes to the sensation of man as delight; but the former good does not come to sensation, but to perception that so it ought to be, and makes a contented mind. 
In the other life spiritual good also comes to sensation. [2] The reason why five oxen were to be repaid for an ox, and four of the flock for one of the flock, cannot be known by anyone unless it 
is known what is meant by "theft" in the spiritual sense, also what by "ox" and by "one of the flock." What these things signify has been unfolded, namely, the taking away and alienation of exterior and 
interior good. This taking away is effected through evil, and alienation through falsity; consequently the penalty and restoration thereof are signified by "five" and "four." That all numbers in the 
Word signify things, see n. 575, 647, 648, 755, 813, 1963, 1988, 2075, 2252, 3252, 4264, 4495, 4670, 5265, 6175; here the things which involve restoration, namely, the number "five" the restoration 
of exterior good to much; and the number "four" the restoration of interior good to the full. Interior good is to be restored to the full, because this good makes the spiritual life of man, and unless 
spiritual life is restored to the full, the exterior good which makes the natural life cannot be restored, for the latter life is restored by means of the former, as can be seen from the regeneration 
of man. (That the external man is regenerated by means of the internal, see n. 9043, 9046, 9061.) But good in the external or natural man cannot be restored to the full, because the injury remains there 
as a scar which is grown callous. These are the things which these numbers involve. [3] A few words more however shall be said about the restoration of exterior good, which makes the natural life 
of man, from interior good which makes his spiritual life. The natural of man sees things in the light of the world, which light is called natural light. Man procures for himself this light by means 
of the objects which enter through the sight and hearing, thus by means of objects which are of the world. Thus man sees those things within himself, almost as the eye sees them. The objects which enter 
by these senses appear to him at first as pleasure and delight. Afterward the infant man distinguishes between the different delights, from which he learns to discriminate, and by degrees to do so 
more perfectly. When light from heaven flows into these things, the man begins to see them spiritually, and first to discriminate between the useful and the non-useful. From this he begins to have an 
insight as to what is true; for that which is useful to him is to him true, and that which is useless is not true. This insight increases according to the influx of the light of heaven, until at last 
he discriminates not only between truths, but also between truths within these truths; and he does this with greater clearness in proportion as the communication is better opened between the internal 
and external man; for the light of heaven inflows from the Lord through the internal man into the external man. [4] From this then man has perception; but still it is not yet spiritual perception. This 
perception does not arise from natural truths, but from spiritual truths. Spiritual truths are those which are called the truths of faith. The reason why spiritual perception arises from these truths, 
is that the light of heaven is Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, and this shines as light before the eyes of the angels, and also shines in their understandings, and gives them intelligence and 
wisdom; but with variety according to the reception of it in good. Wherefore the knowledges of spiritual things must be with man in his natural in order that there may be spiritual perception; and 
knowledges of spiritual things must be from revelation. When the light of heaven flows into these knowledges, it flows into its own, for, as before said, this light is the Divine truth proceeding from 
the Lord (n. 1053, 1521-1533, 1619-1632, 2776, 3138, 3167, 3195, 3222, 3223, 3341, 3636, 3643, 4180, 4302, 4408, 4415, 4527, 5400, 6032, 6313, 6608). From this the man has intelligence and wisdom in 
such things as are of eternal life, and these increase according to the reception of that light, that is, of the truths of faith in good. Good is charity. [5] That the natural or external man is regenerated, 
and also amended and restored, through the internal man, can be seen from what has now been said. For the things which are in the external or natural man live from the light of heaven, for this 
light is living light, because it proceeds from the Lord, who is life itself; but they do not live from natural light, for in itself this light is dead. In order therefore that those things which are 
in natural light may live, there must be an influx of living light through the internal man from the Lord. This influx accommodates itself according to the knowledges of truth analogous and corresponding 
in the natural, and according to the compliance there. From this it is evident that the external or natural of man must be regenerated through his internal. In the same way must the good in the 
natural that has been taken away and alienated, be amended and restored. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9103</b></p><p><b>9103.</b>
'And four of the flock for the member of the flock' also means the corresponding punishment carried out in full. This is clear from the meaning of 'four' as joined together, for 'four' is similar in 
meaning to 'two' because four is the product of two times two (for the meaning of 'two' as joined together, see <a href="5194.htm">5194</a>, <a href="8423.htm">8423</a>, and therefore also 'four', <a href="1686.htm">1686</a>, <a href="8877.htm">8877</a>), from which it follows that those numbers 
also mean to the complete amount, since what has been joined together is complete; and from the meaning of 'a member of the flock' as interior good, dealt with just above in <a href="9099.htm">9099</a>. The corresponding 
punishment is meant by 'repaying', at this point 'four of the flock for one member of the flock', <a href="9102.htm">9102</a>. Interior good is what charity in the interior man is called, exterior good being charity in the 
exterior man. The latter good must receive life from the former, for the good of charity in the interior man is the good of spiritual life, and the good of charity in the exterior man is the good of 
natural life from the spiritual. This exterior good enters a person's feelings as delight, but not so interior good. Instead this enters his awareness that it ought to be so, and enables his mind to 
feel contented. In the next life however interior good too enters into a person's feelings. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 No one can know the reason why five oxen were to be used in repayment for an ox, and four of the flock 
for the member of the flock, unless he knows what 'theft' is in the spiritual sense, and also what 'an ox' and 'a member of the flock' are. What these things mean has been explained, namely taking 
away and alienating exterior and interior good, the taking away being done by evil and the alienation by falsity. Consequently punishment and the restoration of them are meant by 'five' end 'four'; for 
all numbers in the Word serve to mean spiritual things, see <a href="575.htm">575</a>, <a href="647.htm">647</a>, <a href="648.htm">648</a>, <a href="755.htm">755</a>, <a href="813.htm">813</a>, <a href="1963.htm">1963</a>, <a href="1988.htm">1988</a>, <a href="2075.htm">2075</a>, <a href="2252.htm">2252</a>, <a href="3252.htm">3252</a>, <a href="4264.htm">4264</a>, <a href="4495.htm">4495</a>, <a href="4670.htm">4670</a>, <a href="5265.htm">5265</a>, <a href="6175.htm">6175</a>, at this point things having to do with restoration. That 
is to say, the number 'five' refers to restoration of exterior good to a great degree, and the number 'four' to restoration of interior good in full. The reason why interior good must be restored 
completely is that this good constitutes a person's spiritual life; and unless his spiritual life is restored completely the exterior good constituting his natural life cannot be restored; for the latter 
life is restored by means of the former, as may be recognized from a person's regeneration. The external man is regenerated by means of the internal, see <a href="9043.htm">9043</a>, <a href="9046.htm">9046</a>, <a href="9061.htm">9061</a>; but good in the external 
or natural man cannot be restored completely because the blow it has been struck remains there as a scar that becomes hardened. These are the things implied by those numbers. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Something further 
must be said briefly about the restoration of the exterior good constituting a person's natural life by means of the interior good constituting his spiritual life. The natural level of a person's mind 
sees things in the light of the world, the light that is called natural illumination. A person acquires this illumination through objects entering his awareness by means of sight and hearing, that is, 
by impressions of objects received from the world. Thus the person sees those objects with his mind's eye almost exactly as his physical eye sees them. Initially the objects that he is made aware of 
through those senses are all a pleasure and delight to him. Later on, when still a young child, he makes distinctions among the objects that are a delight to him, and thereby learns to discriminate, 
gradually doing so more and more accurately. When the light from heaven flows into these things the person begins to see them spiritually, discriminating initially between the ones that are useful and 
those that are not useful. As a consequence he starts to see the truth clearly; for that which he sees to be useful he sees to be true, and that which he does not see to be useful he sees to be not 
true. This ability to see truth increases as the inflowing light from heaven grows brighter, until eventually he discriminates not only between truths, but even between truths within these truths. And 
this he does ever more clearly, as the communication between the internal man and the external man is improved and opened up; for the light of heaven flows in from the Lord through the internal man into 
the external. From this the person now has perception; nevertheless this is still not spiritual perception. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Spiritual perception does not grow out of natural truths but out of spiritual truths, 
spiritual truths being what are called the truths of faith. The reason why spiritual perception grows out of these truths is that the light of heaven is Divine Truth emanating from the Lord. It is 
the light that shines for the angels' eyes; it also shines in their understanding and imparts intelligence and wisdom to them, in varying amounts, depending on its reception within good. Therefore, 
if spiritual perception is to grow a person must have cognitions or knowledge of spiritual things in his natural, and such knowledge of spiritual things must come from revelation. When the light of heaven 
flows into them it flows into what are its own; for as has been stated, that light is Divine Truth emanating from the Lord, see <a href="1053.htm">1053</a>, <a href="1521.htm">1521</a>-<a href="1533.htm">1533</a>, <a href="1619.htm">1619</a>-<a href="1632.htm">1632</a>, <a href="2776.htm">2776</a>, <a href="3138.htm">3138</a>, <a href="3167.htm">3167</a>, <a href="3195.htm">3195</a>, <a href="3222.htm">3222</a>, <a href="3223.htm">3223</a>, <a href="3341.htm">3341</a>, <a href="3636.htm">3636</a>, <a href="3643.htm">3643</a>, <a href="4180.htm">4180</a>, <a href="4302.htm">4302</a>, <a href="4408.htm">4408</a>, <a href="4415.htm">4415</a>, <a href="4527.htm">4527</a>, <a href="5400.htm">5400</a>, <a href="6032.htm">6032</a>, <a href="6313.htm">6313</a>, <a href="6608.htm">6608</a>. This is how a person acquires intelligence and wisdom in such matters as belong to eternal life; and they increase in the measure that 
such light - that is, in the measure that the truths of faith - are received within good, the good being charity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 The fact that the natural or external man is regenerated, and also undergoes 
amendment and is restored by means of the internal, may be recognized from what has now been stated. Things in the external or natural man receive life from the light of heaven; for this light is living, 
because it emanates from the Lord, who is Life itself. They do not receive their life from natural light, since this light is in itself dead. If therefore things in natural light are to have life 
there must be an inflow of the living light, coming from the Lord through the internal man. This inflow adjusts itself to cognitions of truth present in the natural that are analogous and correspond, 
and to other things there that can serve. From this it is evident that a person's external or natural must be regenerated by means of his internal; and the good in the natural that has been taken away 
or alienated has to be amended and restored by the same means. </p>

6032, 6313, 6608; inde homini (o)est intelligentia et sapientia in talibus quae vitae aeternae sunt, quae crescunt {18} secundum receptionem lucis illius, hoc est, veritatum fidei, in bono; bonum 
est charitas. 	[5] Quod naturalis seu externus homo regeneretur, et quoque emendetur (c)et restituatur per internum {19}, ex jam dictis {20} constare potest; nam quae in externo seu naturali homine sunt 
vivunt ex luce caeli, haec enim lux est viva, quia {21} procedit a Domino, Qui est ipsa vita, non autem vivunt ex luce naturali, nam haec lux est {22} in se mortua; ut ergo ea quae in hac luce sunt 
vivant, erit influxus lucis vivae per internum hominem a Domino; is {23} influxus se accommodat secundum cognitiones veri analogas et correspondentes in naturali, et secundum obsequia (o)ibi.  Inde 
patet quod externum seu naturale hominis regenerandum sit per internum ejus; similiter {24} bonum in naturali ablatum (c)et abalienatum est emendandum ac restituendum. @1 significat altered to significant$ @2
