<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5097节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5097.</strong>“到了早晨，约瑟来到他们那里”表向属灵层的属天层所揭示和显明的。这从“约瑟”的代表和“早晨”的含义清楚可知：“约瑟”是指属灵层的属天层（<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>，<a href="4592.htm">4592</a>，<a href="4963.htm">4963</a>节）；“早晨”是指启示的状态 （<a href="3458.htm">3458</a>节），因而是指被揭示和显明的东西。“早晨”之所以具有这种含义，是因为一天当中的所有时间段，和一年四季一样，表示由天堂之光的变化而产生的各种状态。天堂之光的变化不像世上的光日复一日、年复一年的变化；它们是聪明和爱的变化。因为天堂之光无非是从主流出的神性聪明，它也在眼前闪耀如光，而这光之热就是主的神性之爱，这爱被感觉为温暖。正是这光赋予人理解力，这热赋予他生命之热和渴望良善的意愿。在天堂，早晨是启示的状态，就是在涉及良善与真理事物上的启示状态；当对良善的确是良善，真理的确是真理有了一种承认，尤其有了一种觉知时，这种状态就会产生。觉知是一种内在的启示；因此，“早晨”表示被揭示的某种事物。由于之前模糊的东西现在变得清晰，所以“早晨”也表示变得清晰之物。<br />此外，“早晨”在至高意义上表示主自己，因为主就是太阳，天堂里的所有光都从这太阳流出；祂一直是升起的太阳，因而一直是早晨的太阳。对凡接受为信之真理的真理和为爱之良善的良善之人来说，祂一直是升起的；但对凡不接受这些的人来说，祂是落下的。并不是说那里的太阳是落下的，因为如刚才所述，它一直是升起的太阳；而是说凡不接受真理或良善的人都使得这太阳可以说对他自己来说是落下的。这在某种程度上好比这个世界的太阳对于地球居民来说的变化；事实上，这个太阳也没有落下，因为它一直停留在自己的固定位置，并一直在那里闪耀。然而，它看似落下，因为地球每天绕轴自转，并且由于它的旋转，它使得地球居民看不见太阳（参看<a href="5084.htm">5084</a>节）；因此，太阳其实并未落下，而是住在地球上的人远离了它的光。这个对比可用来说明，由于自然界的每个现象里面都有代表主国度的某种事物，所以它也教导我们。这个现象里面所包含的教导是：天堂之光，也就是聪明和智慧的丧失不是因为作为聪明和智慧的太阳的主向任何人落下，而是因为主国度的居民使自己远离，也就是说，允许地狱引导自己，把他带走。</p>

And Joseph came unto them in the morning. That this signifies revealed and clear to the celestial of the spiritual, is evident from the representation of Joseph, as being the celestial of the spiritual 
(n. 4286, 4592, 4963); and from the signification of "morning," as being a state of enlightenment, (n. 3458), thus what is revealed and clear. That "morning" has this signification is because all times 
of the day, like all times of the year, signify various states in accordance with the variations of the light of heaven. The variations of the light of heaven are not variations like those of the 
light of the world every day and every year, but are variations of intelligence and love; for the light of heaven is nothing else than Divine intelligence from the Lord, which is bright before the eyes; 
and the heat of this light is the Lord's Divine love, which is warm to the sense. It is this light which gives man understanding, and this heat which gives him vital warmth and a will of good. Morning 
in heaven is a state of enlightenment as to those things which are of good and truth, which state exists when it is acknowledged, and still more when it is perceived, that good is good and that truth 
is truth. Perception is internal revelation; hence by the "morning" is signified what is revealed; and because then that becomes clear which before was obscure, by "morning" is also signified what 
is clear. [2] Moreover, by "morning" is signified in the supreme sense the Lord Himself, for the reason that the Lord is the Sun from which comes all the light in heaven, and He is always in the rising, 
thus in the morning. Moreover, He is always rising with everyone who receives the truth which is of faith and the good which is of love, but He is setting with everyone who does not receive these-not 
that the Sun there sets, for as just said He is always in the rising; but that he who does not receive, causes Him as it were to set with himself. This may be compared in some degree to the changes 
of the sun of this world in respect to the inhabitants of the earth; for neither does this sun set, since it always remains in its place and is always shining thence; but it appears as if it set, 
because the earth rotates about its axis once every day, and at the same time removes its inhabitant from the sight of the sun (see n. 5084); and therefore the setting is not in the sun, but in the removal 
of the inhabitant of the earth from its light. This comparison is illustrative; and because in every part of nature there is something representative of the Lord's kingdom, it also instructs us 
that the deprivation of the light of heaven-that is, of intelligence and wisdom-does not take place because the Lord, who is the Sun of intelligence and wisdom, sets with anyone, but because the inhabitant 
of His kingdom removes himself, that is, suffers himself to be led by the hell by which he is removed. </p>

'And Joseph came to them in the morning" means that which was revealed and made clear to the celestial of the spiritual. This is clear from the representation of 'Joseph' as the celestial of the spiritual, 
dealt with in <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>, <a href="4592.htm">4592</a>, <a href="4963.htm">4963</a>, and from the meaning of 'the morning' as a state of enlightenment, dealt with in <a href="3458.htm">3458</a>, so that what was revealed and made clear is meant. The reason 'the morning' 
has these meanings is that all the periods of a day, like all the seasons of a year, mean the various states that arise owing to variations of the light of heaven. Variations of the light of heaven 
are not like the daily and annual variations of light in the world; they are variations of intelligence and love. For the light of heaven is nothing else than Divine Intelligence flowing from the Lord, 
which also shines before the eyes as light, while the warmth accompanying that light is the Lord's Divine Love, which is also felt as a radiated warmth. It is that light which provides a person with 
understanding, and that warmth which provides him with both vital heat and a will desiring what is good. In heaven morning is a state of enlightenment, of enlightenment in matters involving goodness 
and truth; and this state arises when there is an acknowledgement, more so when there is a perception that good is indeed good and truth is indeed truth. Perception is a revelation that takes place internally, 
and therefore 'the morning' means something that has been revealed. And because that which has previously been obscure is now made clear, 'the morning' as a consequence also means that which 
has been made clear. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In addition to this, 'morning" in the highest sense means the Lord Himself, for the reason that the Lord is the sun from which all light in heaven flows; He is always a rising 
sun and so is always a morning one. He is rising always on everyone who receives truth that is the truth of faith and good that is the good of love; but He is setting on everyone who does not receive 
these. Not that the sun there ever sets, for as has been stated, it is always a rising one, but that anyone who does not receive that truth or good causes it so to speak to set on himself. This may 
be compared in some measure to the changes which the sun of the world undergoes so far as the inhabitants on earth are concerned. Here too the sun does not really set since it remains all the time 
in its own fixed position, from where it is constantly shedding light. Yet it does seem to set because the earth spins daily on its axis, and as it goes round it takes its inhabitants out of sight of 
the sun, see the first example given in <a href="5084.htm">5084</a>. Thus the sun does not actually go down but anyone inhabiting the earth is removed from its light. This comparison is used to illustrate a particular point; 
but the phenomenon referred to is in itself instructive because every detail of the natural creation is representative of the Lord's kingdom. The instruction held within that phenomenon is that a loss 
of the light of heaven, that is, of intelligence and wisdom, does not come about because the Lord, the Sun of intelligence and wisdom, sets on anyone. It comes about because the inhabitant of His kingdom 
takes himself away, that is, he allows hell to be his leader and so take him away. </p>

`Et venit ad illos Joseph in matutino': quod significet revelatum et clarum caelesti spiritualis, constat ex repraesentatione `Josephi' quod sit caeleste spiritualis, de qua n. 4286, 4592, 4963; 
et ex significatione `mane' quod sit status illustrationis, de qua n. 3458, ita {1} revelatum et clarum; </p>
<p>(s)quod mane seu `matutinum' illa significet, est quia omnia tempora diei, sicut omnia tempora 
anni, varios status secundum variationes lucis caeli significant; variationes lucis caeli non sunt variationes sicut lucis in mundo quovis die et quovis anno, sed sunt variationes intelligentiae 
et amoris; nam lux caeli non aliud est quam Divina intelligentia a Domino, quae quoque coram oculis lucet, et calor illius lucis est Divinus Domini Amor, qui quoque coram sensu calet; (o)est illa 
lux quae facit intellectuale hominis, et ille calor qui facit calidum ejus vitale et voluntarium boni; mane seu matutinum ibi est status illustrationis, nempe quoad illa quae sunt boni et veri, qui 
tunc existit cum agnoscitur et magis cum percipitur {2} quod bonum sit bonum et verum sit verum; </p>
<p>perceptio est revelatio interna, inde per `mane' significatur revelatum, et quia tunc {3} clarum fit 
quod prius (o)fuit obscurum, inde (t)quoque per `mane' significatur clarum.  [2] Praeterea per `mane' in supremo sensu significatur Ipse Dominus, ex causa quia Dominus est sol ex quo omnis lux in 
caelo, et Ipse semper est in ortivo, (o)ita in matutino; oritur etiam semper apud unumquemvis qui verum quod est fidei et bonum quod est amoris, recipit, at occidit apud unumquemvis qui non recipit; 
non quod sol ibi occidat quia, ut dictum, semper est in ortivo, sed quod qui non recipit, faciat apud se sicut occidat: comparari hoc aliquatenus potest cum vicibus quas sol mundi respective ad 
incolas telluris facit, sol ibi nec occidit, quia semper manet in suo loco et inde semper lucet, sed apparet sicut occidat, quia tellus circum axem semel quovis die volvitur, et tunc simul removet 
incolam ab aspectu solis {4}, videatur n. 5084, p. I {5}; ita quoque non in sole est occiduum, sed in remotione incolae telluris a luce ejus; hoc comparativum illustrat, et quia repraesentativum regni 
Domini est in singulis naturae, etiam instruit; quod privatio lucis caeli, hoc est, intelligentiae et sapientiae, non sit ex eo quod Dominus Qui est sol intelligentiae et sapientiae, apud aliquem 
occidat, sed quod incola regni Ipsius semet ipsum removeat, hoc est, patiatur se duci ab inferno a quo removetur.(s) </p>
