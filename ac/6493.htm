<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6493节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6493.</strong>我常与灵人谈论运气，在世上，运气在人们看来，就像偶然的机会，因为他们不知道它源于何处；并且由于他们不知道它源于何处，所以有些人否认运气的存在。每当有看似偶然的事发生在我身上时，天使就告诉我，这种事之所以发生，是因为有恶灵在场；当我遭遇不幸时，相应的这类灵人的气场正在占上风。此外，恶灵还发现如何利用他们的诡计制造一种气场，以引发明显看似偶然的不幸事件。天使继续说，一切事，事实上，一切事的细节，直到细节中的细节，都受主的圣治或天命引导，甚至包括双脚所迈的步伐。当违背圣治或天命的这种气场占上风时，不幸就会发生。他们还证实了这一断言：诸如纯偶然的事是不存在的，看似意外的事件或运气其实是圣治或天命在终极秩序里的运行，在终极秩序里的一切事物相对来说都是变化无常的。</p>

I have often spoken with spirits about fortune, which in the world appears like chance, because men know not whence it is; and because they do not know this, some deny that there is such a thing. When 
something happened to me which seemed to be by chance, I was told by the angels that it had happened because spirits of that kind were present; and that when it was a mischance, the sphere of spirits 
of a corresponding kind had prevailed. Moreover evil spirits have found out how to produce by their arts a sphere giving rise to misfortunes, which appeared exactly as if of chance. And it was further 
said that all things, nay, the leasts of all things, down to the leasts of the leasts, are directed by the Providence of the Lord, even as to the very steps; and when such a sphere prevails as is contrary 
thereto, misfortunes happen. They also confirmed the fact that there is no such thing as chance, and that apparent accident, or fortune, is Providence in the ultimate of order, in which all things 
are comparatively inconstant. </p>

I have often talked to spirits about fortune, which seems to people in the world like haphazard chance since they do not know its origin; and some, because they do not know its origin, deny its existence. 
Whenever something happened to me that seemed haphazard, the angels told me that it happened because evil spirits were present, and when I suffered some mishap, they said that the sphere of that 
kind of spirits was prevailing. Evil spirits also discovered how, by the use of the tricks they knew, to produce a sphere from which misfortunes resulted that looked plainly like the products of mere 
chance. The angels went on to say that all things, in fact the smallest of all things, and even the smallest of the smallest, are directed by the Lord's Providence, down to the very steps taken by the 
feet. And when the kind of thing prevails that is contrary to Providence, misfortunes occur. They also substantiated the assertion that there is no such thing as mere chance and that what seems to be 
haphazard, or fortune, is Providence at work in the last and lowest degree of order, in which all things are subject to comparative inconstancy. </p>

Saepe locutus sum cum spiritibus de fortuna, quae in mundo  apparet sicut casus fortuitus, quia non sciunt unde; et quia hoc non sciunt, quidam negant quod sit.  Cum mihi accideret tale quod appareret 
sicut fortuitum, dictum (c)est ab angelis quod accideret quia tales spiritus aderant, et cum fortuitum malum, quod sphaera talium spirituum praevaleret; etiam mali spiritus per artes suas invenerunt 
producere sphaeram ex qua infortunata quae apparebant plane sicut ex casu; et porro dictum quod omnia, immo omnium minima ad minimorum minima, dirigantur a Providentia Domini, {1}usque quoad ipsos gressus; 
cumque tale praevalet quod contrarium (c)illi est, accidunt infortunata; et confirmatum ab illis est quod non detur aliquis casus; et quod fortuitum apparens seu fortuna, sit Providentia in ultimo 
ordinis in quo omnia inconstanter se respective habent. @1 imo$ </p>
