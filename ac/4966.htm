<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4966节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4966.</strong>“护卫长”表那些在解释中首先到来并最为重要的事物。这从“护卫长”的含义清楚可知，“护卫长”是指在解释首先到来并最为重要的事物（<a href="4790.htm">4790</a>节）。在解释中首先到来并最为重要的事物就是特别适合解释圣言，因而有助于理解取自圣言的对神之爱和对邻之仁的教义的事物。要知道，古人的记忆知识完全不同于如今的记忆知识。如前所述，古人的记忆知识论述的是自然界的事物与灵界的事物的对应关系。被称为哲学的知识，就是诸如亚里士多德以及像他那样的人所研究的那类知识，并不为他们所知。这一点从古代作家所写的书也能明显看出来，其中大多数都是以表示、代表并对应于内在事物的语言写成的，这从下面的例子可以看出来，更不用提其它了。<br />他们想象大山上的赫利孔，以它来表示天堂；又想象下面小山上一个叫帕纳索斯的地方，以它来表示记忆知识。他们说，有一匹飞马，叫佩加索斯，用蹄子踏开一个源泉；他们将知识的分支称为少女或童女，以及其它类似传统。因为在对应和代表的帮助下，他们知道“大山”表示天堂，“小山”表示在此之下的天堂，也就是在人中间的天堂；“马”表示理解力；它用来飞行的“翅膀”表示属灵事物；“马蹄”表示属世心智；“源泉”表示聪明；而被称为“美惠三女神”的那三个少女或童女表示对良善的情感；被称为“缪斯”或“赫利孔”和“帕纳索斯”的少女或童女表示对真理的情感。他们同样将马指定给太阳，将其食物称为仙果，将其所喝的称为花蜜；因为他们知道，“太阳”表示属天之爱，“马”表示源于这爱的理解力，而“食物”表示属天事物，“所喝的”表示属灵事物。<br />国王加冕时仍旧遵循的习俗也源于古人。那时，国王要坐在银宝座上，穿紫袍，膏抹油，头戴王冠，手拿权杖、剑和钥匙。他要在皇家的气派中骑上一匹白马，马掌是用银子打造的；他在席前必须由王国的贵胄侍候，以及其它礼仪。因为古人知道“王”代表植根于神性良善的神性真理，由此知道银宝座、紫袍、膏油、王冠、权杖、剑、钥匙、白马、银马掌，以及在席上被贵胄侍候分别表示什么。如今谁知道这些习俗的含义？或教导它们含义的知识在哪里？人们将这类事物称为象征，却根本不知道凡有关对应和代表的任何事。由此明显可知，古人所拥有的知识是何性质，这种知识赋予他们对属灵和属天事物的洞察力；而如今，人们几乎不知道这类事物的存在。<br />取代古人的知识、严格来说被称为哲学的知识倾向于使心智远离认识这类事物，因为它们也能被用来确认虚假。此外，当真理通过它们被确认时，它们就会将心智引入黑暗，因为它们大部分是用来确认的纯粹术语；很少有人明白这些术语，甚至明白的人也很少争论它们。由此明显可知人类离古人的学问有多远，而古人的学问通向智慧。外邦人从古教会那里获得这些知识，其外在敬拜就在于代表和有意义的符号；其内在敬拜则在于所代表和表示的那些事物。这些就是“埃及”真正意义上所表示的知识。</p>

Prince of the guards. That this signifies those which are primary for interpretation, is evident from the signification of "prince of the guards," as being things primary for interpretation (n. 4790): 
things primary for interpretation are those which primarily conduce to the interpretation of the Word, and thus to the understanding of the doctrinal things of love to God and of charity toward the 
neighbor, which are from the Word. Be it known that the memory-knowledges of the ancients were altogether different from those of the present day. As before said the memory-knowledges of the ancients 
treated of the correspondence of things in the natural world with things in the spiritual world. The memory-knowledges which are now called philosophy, such as that of Aristotle and others like him, were 
unknown to them. This is evident also from the books of the ancient writers, most of which were written in language that signified, represented, and corresponded to interior things, as is evident 
from the following instances, not to mention others.  [2] They located Helicon on a mountain, and by it they meant heaven; they gave to Parnassus a place below on a hill, by which they meant memory-knowledges, 
where they said that a flying horse, called Pegasus, broke open a fountain with his hoof; the sciences they called virgins, with other such traditions. For they knew from correspondences and 
representatives that a mountain denotes heaven; a hill, that heaven which is beneath, or which is with man; a horse, the understanding; the wings with which he flew, spiritual things; a hoof, the natural 
mind; a fountain, intelligence; the three virgins who were called the Graces, affections of good; and the virgins who were called the Muses, affections of truth. So also they assigned to the sun 
horses, the food of which they called ambrosia, and their drink, nectar; for they knew that the sun signified celestial love, horses the intellectual things therefrom; and that food signifies celestial 
things, and drink spiritual things. [3] From the ancients also there still survives the custom for kings at their coronation to sit upon a silver throne, to be clothed with a crimson robe, to be anointed 
with oil, to wear a crown on the head, and to carry a scepter, sword, and keys in their hands, to ride in royal pomp upon a white horse whose hoofs are shod with silver, and to be waited on at 
table by the chiefs of the kingdom, with other ceremonies; for they knew that a king represented Divine truth which is from Divine good, and hence they knew what is signified by a silver throne, a crimson 
robe, anointing oil, a crown, a scepter, a sword, keys, a white horse, hoofs shod with silver, and being waited on by chief men. Who at this day knows these significations, and where are the knowledges 
that teach them? Men call such things emblems, not knowing anything whatever about correspondence and representation. From all this it is evident of what nature were the knowledges of the ancients, 
and that they brought them into a knowledge of spiritual and heavenly things which at this day are scarcely known to exist.  [4] The knowledges which succeeded those of the ancients, and are properly 
called philosophy, rather draw away the mind from the knowledge of such things, because they can also be applied to the confirmation of falsities; and moreover when truths are confirmed by means 
of them, they plunge the mind into darkness, because they are for the most part bare expressions, whereby confirmations are effected which are comprehended by few, and regarding which even these few 
are not agreed. From this it is evident how far mankind has receded from the erudition of the ancients, which led to wisdom. The Gentiles received those knowledges from the Ancient Church, the external 
worship of which consisted in representatives and significatives, and the internal in those things which were represented and signified. These were the knowledges which, in the genuine sense, are signified 
by "Egypt." </p>

'The chief of the attendants' means which facts come first and foremost in explanations. This is clear from the meaning of 'the chief of the attendants' as the facts which come first and foremost in 
explanations, dealt with in <a href="4790.htm">4790</a>. Ones which come first and foremost in explanations are those which are pre-eminently suitable for explaining the Word, and so for coming to understand teachings drawn 
from the Word about love to God and charity towards the neighbour. It should be recognized that the factual knowledge of the people of old was entirely different from that existing at the present day. 
As stated above, the factual knowledge of the people of old had to do with the correspondences of things in the natural world with realities in the spiritual world. Knowledge which at the present day 
is called philosophical knowledge, such as Aristotelian systems and their like, did not exist among them. This is also evident from the books written by ancient authors, most of which consisted of descriptions 
of such things as were signs of, represented, and corresponded to more internal realities, as may be seen from the following evidence, and ignoring all else. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 They envisaged Helicon 
on a mountain and took it to mean heaven, and Parnassus on a hill below that, and took it to mean factual knowledge. They spoke of a flying horse, called Pegasus by them, which broke open a fountain there 
with its hoof; they called branches of knowledge virgins; and so on. For with the help of correspondences and representatives they knew that 'a mountain' meant heaven, 'a hill' the heaven beneath 
this, which is heaven as it exists among men, a horse' the power of understanding, 'its wings with which it flew' spiritual things, 'its hoof' that which was natural, 'a fountain' intelligence, while 
three virgins called 'the Graces' meant affections for good, and virgins who were named 'the Heliconians and 'the Parnassians' meant affections for truth. To the sun they likewise allotted horses, whose 
food they called ambrosia and whose drink they called nectar; for they knew that 'the sun' meant heavenly love, 'horses' powers of the understanding which sprang from that love, while 'food' meant 
celestial things and 'drink' spiritual ones. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The Ancients are also the originators of customs that are still followed when kings are crowned. The king has to sit on a silver throne, wear a purple 
robe, and be anointed with oil. He has to wear a crown on his head, while holding in his hands a sceptre, a sword, and keys. He has to ride in regal splendour on a white horse shed with horseshoes 
made of silver; and he has to be waited on at table by the chief nobles of the kingdom. And many other customs are followed besides these. The Ancients knew that 'a king' represented Divine Truth that 
is rooted in Divine Good, and from this they knew what was meant by a silver throne, a purple robe, anointing oil, crown, sceptre, sword, keys, white horse, horseshoes made of silver, and what was meant 
by being waited on at table by the chief nobles. Who at the present day knows the meaning of any of these customs, or where the information exists to show him their meaning? People refer to them 
as symbols, but they know nothing at all about correspondence or representation. All this evidence shows what the factual knowledge possessed by the Ancients was like, and that this knowledge gave them 
a discernment of spiritual and heavenly realities, which at the present day are scarcely known to exist. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The factual knowledge that has replaced that of the Ancients, and which strictly speaking 
is called philosophical knowledge, tends to draw the mind away from knowing such things because such knowledge can also be employed to substantiate false ideas. Furthermore, even when used to substantiate 
true ones it introduces darkness into the mind, because for the most part mere terms are used to substantiate them, which few people can understand and which the few who do understand them argue 
about. From this it may be seen how far the human race has departed from the learning of the Ancients, which led to wisdom. Gentiles received their factual knowledge from the Ancient Church, whose 
external worship consisted in representatives and meaningful signs and whose internal worship consisted in the realities represented and meant by these. This was the kind of factual knowledge that is 
meant in the genuine sense by 'Egypt'. </p>

`Princeps satellitum':  quod significet quae primaria interpretationi, constat ex significatione `principis satellitum' quod sint primaria interpretationi, de qua n. 4790; `primaria interpretationi' 
sunt illa quae primario conducunt ad interpretandum Verbum; ac ita ad intelligendum doctrinalia amoris in Deum et charitatis erga proximum quae ex Verbo. Sciendum quod scientifica veterum prorsus 
alia fuerint quam scientifica hodie; </p>
<p>scientifica veterum egerunt, ut supra dictum, de correspondentiis rerum in mundo naturali cum rebus in mundo spirituali; scientifica quae hodie vocantur philosophica, 
qualia sunt Aristotelica (c)ac similia, illis ignota fuerunt; hoc quoque patet a libris vetustiorum, quorum plerique conscripti sunt per talia quae interiora significabant, repraesentabant, 
et illis correspondebant; </p>
<p>[2] ut {1} constare potest solum ex his, ut taceantur reliqua: quod Heliconem in monte statuerint et per illum intellexerint caelum; </p>
<p>quod Parnassum infra in colle et per 
illum intellexerint scientifica; quod dixerint equum volantem quem Pegasum vocarunt, rupisse ibi fontem ungula; quod scientias vocaverint virgines, et sic porro; sciverunt enim ex correspondentiis 
et repraesentativis quod `mons' esset caelum, quod `collis' esset id caelum quod infra est seu quod apud hominem, quod `equus' esset intellectuale, quod `alae quibus volabat' essent spiritualia, 
quod `ungula' esset naturale, quod `fons' esset intelligentia {2}, et quod `tres virgines quae charites dictae' essent affectiones boni, et quod `virgines quae Heliconides {3}et Parnassides nominatae', 
essent affectiones veri. Similiter quod sui attribuerint equos, quorum cibum vocabant ambrosiam et potum nectarem, sciebant enim quod `sol' significaret amorem caelestem, `equi' intellectualia 
quae inde sunt, et quod `cibi' caelestia, et `potus' spiritualia.  [3] Ex antiquis etiam manet quod reges cum coronantur, sedebunt super throno argenteo, induendi chlamyde purpurea, ungendi oleo, portabunt 
capite coronam, manibus sceptrum gladium, {4} claves, equitabunt in regio ornatu super equo albo, sub cujus pedibus ungulae argenti, ad mensam tunc {5}ministrabuntur ab optimatibus regni, 
praeter plura; sciebant enim quod `rex' repraesentaret Divinum Verum quod ex Divino Bono, et inde quid thronus argenteus, chlamys purpurea, oleum unctionis, corona, sceptrum, gladius, claves, equus 
albus, ungulae argenti, ministratio ab optimatibus; </p>
<p>quis hodie {6}illa novit, et ubi scientifica quae illa docent; </p>
<p>emblemata vocant, prorsus non scientes aliquid de correspondentia et repraesentatione. 
 Ex his patet qualia fuerunt scientifica antiquorum, et quod illa duxerint (c)eos in cognitionem de spiritualibus et caelestibus, quae quoque hodie vix sciuntur quod sint.  [4] Scientifica 
quae loco illorum successerunt, et proprie philosophica dicuntur, abstrahunt potius mentem a sciendis talibus, quia applicari possunt etiam ad confirmanda falsa; et quoque mittunt mentem in tenebras 
cum per illa confirmantur vera, quia pleraque nudae voces sunt per quas confirmationes fiunt, quae a paucis capiuntur, et de quibus etiam pauci illi disceptant; inde constare potest quantum recessit 
genus humanum ab eruditione antiquorum, quae duxit ad sapientiam.  Gentiles illa habuerunt ab Ecclesia Antiqua, cujus cultus externus constabat in repraesentativis et significativis, ac internus 
in illis quae repraesentabantur et significabantur.  Haec erant scientifica quae in genuino sensu per `Aegyptum' significantur. @1 i satis$  @2 i inde$  @3 seu$  @4 i et$  @5 ministrabunt illo
