<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2741节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2741.</strong>善与真不断从主流入到所有人，所以真正的婚姻之爱也是如此。不过，这爱以各种方式被接受；接受它的是何性质，它就变成何种性质。它在好色之徒身上会转化为淫荡，在行淫者身上会转化为淫行，其天堂的幸福则转化为污秽的快乐，天堂因此沦为地狱。这就像阳光落到物体上，阳光照着物体的性质被接受，并照着接受它的方式而变成蓝、红、黄、绿色，甚至变暗变黑。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2741</b></p><p><b>2741.</b>
Good and truth are continually flowing in from the Lord with all, and consequently so is genuine conjugial love; but it is received in various ways; and as it is received, such it becomes. With the lascivious 
it is turned into lasciviousness, with adulterers into adulteries, its heavenly happiness into unclean delight, thus heaven into hell. The case with this is as with the light of the sun flowing 
into objects, which is received according to the nature of the objects, and becomes blue, red, yellow, green, dark, and even black, according to the reception. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2741</b></p><p><b>2741.</b>
Good and truth are flowing in constantly from the Lord with all people and so consequently is genuine conjugial love; but it is received in varying ways. And as is the nature of that which receives it 
so does that love become. With the licentious it is converted into licentiousness, with adulterers into adultery. Heavenly happiness is converted into unclean delight, thus heaven into hell. It is like 
the light of the sun falling on objects, in that this light is received according to the nature of those objects, and becomes blue, red, yellow, green, dark, or even black, depending on how they receive it. </p>

</p><b>2741.</b>
Bonum et verum continue influit a Domino apud omnes, proinde amor genuinus conjugialis, sed diversimode recipitur, et sicut recipitur, talis fit; apud lascivos vertitur in lasciviam, apud adulteros 
in adulteria, felicitas caelestis in jucundum immundum {1}, ita caelum in infernum; se habet hoc sicut solis lux influens in objecta, quae secundum formam objectorum recipitur, et fit caeruleum, rubicundum, 
flavum, viride, obscurum, etiam nigrum, secundum receptionem. 	@1 A has corporeum with immundum written above.$ </p>
