<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10412节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10412</strong>.“且亚伦宣告说，明日是耶和华（注：jehovah，首字母是小写）的节日”表这是值得庆祝的教会真正重要的事，是要不断受到敬拜的真正神性实在。这从“节日”和“明日”的含义清楚可知：“节日”是指在庆祝方面的教会的敬拜，因为节日是庆祝的日子；因此，“宣告节日”表示值得庆祝的教会极其重要的事；这节日被称为“耶和华的节日”表示要受到敬拜的神性本质实在。“明日”是指永恒不断之物（参看<a href="3998.htm">3998</a>，<a href="7140.htm">7140</a>，<a href="9939.htm">9939</a>节）。<br />此外，那些兴趣在于外在事物，而不在于内在事物的人都渴望被当作神来敬拜，把自己的东西当作神性来崇拜，只要他们对普通民众的畏惧允许他们。由此可以推断，他们心里拒绝承认神性，不断渴望上升到更高位置，并且只要没有什么东西拦挡他们，甚至上升到最高位置，最后直达神的宝座；这一点从圣言中巴比伦所表示的那些人明显看出来，他们将天上地上的一切权柄都从主那里夺走并归为己有。因为他们随心所欲地打开天堂和关闭天堂。他们就具有这种秉性，这一事实清楚可见于以赛亚书：<br />你必讲述这论到巴比伦的寓言：下面的阴间因你而搅动。路西弗啊，你何竟从天上坠落？你竟被砍倒在地，衰弱在列族之下。你心里曾说，我要升到诸天，我要高举我的宝座在神众星以上，我要坐在聚会的山上；我要升到高云之上，我要使自己像至高者一样。然而你竟被送下阴间。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.4.htm">14:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.12.htm">12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.15.htm">15</a>）<br />巴比伦王也的确命令要把他当作神来敬拜，这一点明显可见于但以理书第6章。“巴比伦”表示那些外在神圣，内在亵渎的人，因而表示那些利用教会的圣物为手段，来达到他们自己被当作神来敬拜的目的之人。这也是所有利用教会的圣物为手段来努力达到作为他们目的的上升到超越他人的显赫地位，获得比他人更大的财富之人所做的。这种人在来世仍是这个样子。在那里，他们还从心里拒绝承认神性，并通过  难以启齿的伎俩使自己成为神。他们把自己高举在山上，宣告他们当中的某个人是神，还崇拜他。但当他们进行这种亵渎的敬拜时，那山就裂开，露出一道深深的裂缝，把他们吞没了；他们就这样被扔进地狱。我有好几次被允许看到这一幕。</p>

And Aaron made proclamation, and said, Tomorrow is a feast to jehovah.* That this signifies that this is a very essential of the church, which is to be celebrated, and a very divine which is to be perpetually 
adored, is evident from the signification of a "feast," as being the worship of the church in respect to celebration, for a celebration was made on the feast days; thus by "proclaiming a feast" 
is signified some very essential thing of the church which is to be celebrated. That it denotes a very divine that is to be adored, is signified by that feast being called "a feast to jehovah."* And 
from the signification of "tomorrow," as being what is eternal and perpetual (see n. 3998, 7140, 9939). [2] Moreover those who are in external things without what is internal desire to be worshiped 
as a god, and to have what is their own adored as Divine, insofar as they dare, on account of the common people. From this it may be concluded that in their heart they deny the Divine, and that they 
themselves are continually aspiring to loftier things, and insofar as obstacles are not presented, to the loftiest things, thus at last to the throne of God; as is very plain from those who in the Word 
are meant by "Babel," who take away from the Lord all power in heaven and on earth, and arrogate it to themselves, opening and shutting heaven at their pleasure. That they are of such a character is 
evident in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Utter this parable concerning the king of Babel. Hell below has been moved on thine account; how hast thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer! Thou hast been cut off to the earth, 
thou hast been weakened beneath the nations; and thou saidst in thine heart, I will ascend into the heavens, I will exalt my throne above the stars, and I will sit on the mount of assembly, I will ascend 
above the heights of the cloud, I will become like the Most High. Howbeit thou hast been let down to hell (Isa. 14:4, 9, 12-15). [3] That the king of Babel did indeed command that he should be 
worshiped as a god, is evident in Daniel 6. By "Babel" are meant those who are holy in externals but profane in internals, thus those who use the holy things of the church as means that they themselves 
may be worshiped as gods, which also all those do who by the holy things of the church as means are desirous of rising to dignities above others, and to wealth above others, as their ends. With such 
persons the case is similar in the other life. There also at heart they deny the Divine, and by wicked arts labor to make themselves gods. They set themselves aloft upon mountains, and proclaim some 
one from amid them as a god, and also adore him. But when they are in this profane worship, the mountain opens into a chasm, and they are swallowed up, and are thus cast down into hell. That it is so 
has been granted me to see several times. * The name "jehovah" is in this connection given by Swedenborg with a small initial letter, doubtless because as applied to the golden calf the name is profane 
and unworthy of veneration. The same remark applies to "divine" as here used, for contrary to his usual custom Swedenborg here writes this word with a small initial letter. See also n. 10566, 10603.

'And Aaron made a proclamation and said, Tomorrow there will be a feast to Jehovah' means that this is the really essential thing of the Church which is to be celebrated and the truly Divine reality 
that is to be worshipped unceasingly. This is clear from the meaning of 'a feast' as the inclusion of celebration within the Church's worship, for feast days were times of celebration, so that 'proclaiming 
a feast' means the essential thing of the Church which is to be celebrated - the Divine essential reality that is to be worshipped being meant by the declaration that this feast was called 'a feast 
to Jehovah'; and from the meaning of 'tomorrow' as that which is eternal and unceasing, dealt with in <a href="3998.htm">3998</a>, <a href="7140.htm">7140</a>, <a href="9939.htm">9939</a>. </p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Those furthermore whose interest lies in external things and not in what 
is internal wish to be worshipped as a god and to have what is theirs venerated as something Divine, so far as their fear of the common people will let them. From this one may deduce that at heart they 
refuse to recognize the Divine and are constantly yearning to rise to higher positions, and so far as nothing stands in their way to the highest, and so finally to the throne of God, as is plainly 
evident from those meant in the Word by Babel, who take all power in heaven and on earth away from the Lord and ascribe it to themselves. For they open heaven and close it just as they please. The fact 
that this is what they are like is clear in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
You will declare this parable about the king of Babel, Hell beneath has been stirred up on account of you. How have you fallen from heaven, O 
Lucifer? You have been cut down to the earth, you have been weakened below the nations. And you said in your heart, I will go up the heavens, above the stars of God I will raise my throne, and I will 
sit on the mount of assembly; I will go up above the heights of the clouds, I will make myself like the Most High. But yet you have been sent down to hell. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2014:4,9,12-15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 14:4,9,12-15</a>.  
</blockquote>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 Also the king of 
Babel commanded that he should be worshipped as a god, as is clear in Daniel <a href="6.htm">6</a>. 'Babel' is used to mean those who are outwardly holy but inwardly unholy, thus those who employ the holy things of the Church 
as means to the end that they themselves may be worshipped as gods. This also is what all those people do who by using the holy things of the Church as the means strive to rise to eminent positions 
over others and greater wealthiness than others as ends in themselves. Such people are just the same in the next life. There as well they refuse at heart to recognize the Divine and endeavour by means 
of unmentionable tricks to make themselves gods. They place themselves high up on mountains, proclaiming and adoring one of their number as a god. But when they engage in that unholy worship the 
mountain splits apart to reveal a deep chasm which swallows them up, and in this way they are thrown down into hell. I have been allowed several times to see that this is so.  </p>

`Et proclamabat Aharon, et dicebat, Festum jehovae   cras': quod significet quod hoc sit ipsum Ecclesiae quod celebrandum, ac ipsum Divinum quod adorandum perpetuo, constat ex significatione `festi' 
quod sit Ecclesiae cultus quoad celebrationem, nam diebus festis celebratio fiebat; ita per `proclamare festum' significatur ipsum Ecclesiae quod celebrandum: quod sit ipsum Divinum quod adorandum, significatur 
per quod festum illud {1}dictum sit `Festum jehovae'; et ex significatione `cras' quod sit aeternum et perpetuum, de qua n. 3998, 7140, 9939; [2] qui etiam in externis sunt absque interno, 
volunt coli ut deus, et suum adorari ut divinum, quantum audent propter vulgus; ex eo concludi potest quod corde suo Divinum negent, et quod ipsi continue spirent ad altiora, et {2} quantum non obstat, 
{3}ad altissima, ita tandem ad thronum Dei, {4}ut evidenter patet ex illis qui in Verbo intelliguntur per Babelem, qui Domino omnem potestatem in caelis   et in terris derogant, ac sibi arrogant; aperiunt 
enim caelum, et claudunt illud ex lubitu; quod (t)illi tales sint, constat {5} apud Esaiam, 	Enunties hanc parabolam de rege Babelis, Infernus inferius commotus est propter te; quomodo occidisti 
de caelo, Lucifer, excisus es in terram, infirmatus es infra gentes: atque tu dixisti in corde tuo, Caelos ascendam, supra stellas Dei exaltabo thronum meum, et sedebo in monte conventus, ascendam 
supra excelsa nubis, similis fiam Altissimo; verumtamen ad infernum demissus es, xiv 4, 9, 12-15: </p>
<p>[3] quod etiam rex Babelis mandaverit, ut pro deo coleretur, constat apud Danielem vi; per `Babelem' 
intelliguntur illi qui in externis sancti sunt sed in internis profani, ita illi qui sanctis Ecclesiae pro mediis utuntur ut ipsi colantur pro diis; quod etiam omnes illi faciunt qui per sancta Ecclesiae 
ut media ad dignitates supra alios et ad opulentiam supra alios, ut fines, affectant emergere. Cum talibus similiter se habet in altera vita; ibi etiam Divinum negant corde ac nefandis artibus allaborant 
se deos facere; ponunt se alte super montibus, et quendam {6}e medio eorum proclamant pro deo, et quoque adorant; sed cum in cultu illo profano sunt, aperit se mons in hiatum et {7}deglutiuntur, 
et sic dejiciuntur in internum; quod ita sit, aliquoties videre datum est. @1 dixerit$  @2 i quoque$  @3 ascendunt, et tandem$  @4 d ut i prout$  @5 i etiam$  @6 in$  @7 deglutit eos$  </p>
