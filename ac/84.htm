<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第84节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>84.</strong>创世记2:2-3 到第七日，神造物的工已经完毕，就在第七日歇了他一切的工，安息了。神赐福给第七日，定为圣日，因为在这日神歇了他一切创造的工，就安息了。<br />“第七日”象征属天之人。主六日作工，被称为“造物的工”。到第七日，一切冲突止息了，经上便说主“歇了他一切的工”。正因如此，第七日被定为圣日，称为“安息日”。照希伯来文，其义为“安歇”。人就这样被创造，被作成了。这些都是显而易见的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]84.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_84/bible_king-james-version_genesis_2_2-3" target=_top>Genesis 2:2-3</a>. And on the seventh day God completed the work that he had done; and he rested on the seventh day from all the work that he had done. And God blessed the seventh day and consecrated it, because on it he rested from all the work that he had done as God in creating it.<br />A heavenly person is the seventh day. And since the Lord worked through six days, that individual is called his work. Conflict then comes to an end, as a result of which the Lord is said to rest from all his work. This is why the seventh day was consecrated and named "Sabbath," from [a Hebrew word for] rest. In the process the human being has been made, formed, and created, as the words themselves clearly indicate. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 84</b></p><p><b>84.</b>
Verses 2, 3. And on the seventh day God finished His work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because 
that in it He rested from all His work which God in making created. The celestial man is the "seventh day" which, as the Lord has worked during the six days, is called "His work;" and as all combat 
then ceases, the Lord is said to "rest from all His work." On this account the seventh day was sanctified, and called the Sabbath, from a Hebrew word meaning "rest." And thus was man created, formed, 
and made. These things are very evident from the words. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 84</b></p><p><b>84.</b>
Verses 2, 3 And on the seventh day God finished His work which He had made, and rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made. And God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, for on 
that day He rested from all His work which God had created when making it.  </p>
<p>The celestial man is 'the seventh day'; and because throughout the six days it has been the Lord at work, that man is called 
'His work'. In addition, because conflict at that point ceases, the Lord is said 'to rest from all His work'. It was for this reason that the seventh day was made holy and was called the Sabbath 
from a word for 'rest'; and it was in this manner that man was created, formed, and made, as may be seen plainly from the words themselves. </p>

Vers. 2, 3.  Et absolvit Deus in die septimo opus Suum, quod fecit; et quievit in die septimo ab omni opere Suo, quod fecit. Et benedixit Deus diei septimo, et sanctificavit illum, quia in illo quievit 
ab omni opere Suo, quod creavit Deus faciendo. Homo caelestis est 'septimus dies' et quia per sex dies operatus est Dominus, dicitur 'opus Ipsius': et quia tunc cessat pugna, dicitur Dominus 'quiescere 
ab omni opere Suo'; quare septimus dies sanctificatus est, et dictas 'sabbatum' a quiete; et sic homo creatus est, formatus, et factus; haec a verbis manifeste perspiciuntur.
