<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8263节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8263.</strong>“我要向耶和华歌唱”表这荣耀唯独属于主。这从“向耶和华歌唱”的含义清楚可知，“向耶和华歌唱”是指将荣耀归与主，如刚才所述（<a href="8261.htm">8261</a>节）；也就是说，这荣耀属于祂。它之所以唯独属于祂，是因为在圣言中，“耶和华”是指主（<a href="8261.htm">8261</a>节），因此主是独一神。在圣言的各处，经上都说，荣耀或尊荣、威严必唯独属于神。凡不知道圣言内层事物的人都以为主像世人那样渴望并喜爱荣耀；他这样认为是因为荣耀优先于宇宙所有人而归于祂。但主渴望荣耀不是为了祂自己，而为了那将荣耀归与祂的人。一个将荣耀归与祂的人如此行，是因为他将主作为至高无上者来尊崇，并且相比之下，出于谦卑将自己视为无有。由于当一个人将荣耀归与主时，尊崇和谦卑就都有了，那时他处于一个适合接受来自主的良善，也接受对祂的爱之流注的状态。这就是为何主渴望一个人将荣耀归与祂（参看<a href="4347.htm">4347</a>，<a href="4593.htm">4593</a>，<a href="5957.htm">5957</a>节）。来自主的良善的流注进入一颗谦卑的心（参看<a href="3994.htm">3994</a>，<a href="7478.htm">7478</a>节）。</p>

I will sing to Jehovah. That this signifies that to the Lord alone is the glory, is evident from the signification of "to sing to Jehovah," as being to glorify the Lord (of which just above, n. 8261); 
thus that to Him is the glory. That it is to Him alone, is because the Lord is "Jehovah" in the Word (n. 8261), thus is the only God. It is said in the Word throughout that to God alone shall be glory 
and honor. He who knows not the interior things of the Word may believe that the Lord desires and loves glory like a man in the world; and also for the reason that it is due to Him in preference to 
all in the universe; but the Lord does not desire glory for the sake of Himself, but for the sake of the man who glorifies Him. The man who glorifies Him does it from a holy reverence for Him in that 
He is the Supreme One, and from a humbling of himself as being relatively nothing; and because in the glorification of the Lord by the man there is thus both holy reverence and humiliation, the man is 
then in a state to receive the influx of good from the Lord, thus also to receive love to Him. It is from this that the Lord desires man to glorify Him (see n. 4347, 4593, 5957). (That the influx of 
good from the Lord is into a humble heart, see n. 3994, 7478.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8263</b></p><p><b>8263.</b>
'I will sing to Jehovah' means that glory belongs to the Lord alone. This is clear from the meaning of 'singing to Jehovah' as ascribing glory to the Lord, dealt with just above in <a href="8261.htm">8261</a>, that is, as 
saying that glory belongs to Him. The reason why it belongs to Him alone is that in the Word 'Jehovah' means the Lord, <a href="8261.htm">8261</a>, so that He alone is God. Various places throughout the Word say that glory 
and honour must belong to God alone. Anyone unacquainted with the inner teachings of the Word may suppose that the Lord desires and loves glory in the way a person in the world does; and he may suppose 
this because glory is appropriate to Him above all others in the universe. But the Lord does not desire glory for His own sake, only for the sake of the person who ascribes it to Him. A person who ascribes 
glory to Him does so because he venerates Him as the One who is supreme and humbly regards himself as nothing in comparison. And since reverence and humility are both present when a person ascribes 
glory to the Lord, he is in a fit state to receive the inflow of goodness from the Lord, and so also of love towards Him. This is why the Lord desires a person to ascribe glory to Him, see <a href="4347.htm">4347</a>, <a href="4593.htm">4593</a>, <a href="5957.htm">5957</a>. Regarding the flow of goodness from the Lord, that it enters a humble heart, <a href="3994.htm">3994</a>, <a href="7478.htm">7478</a>. </p>

</p><b>8263.</b>
`Cantabo Jehovae': quod significet quod Domino soli gloria, constat ex significatione `cantare Jehovae' quod sit glorificare Dominum, de qua mox supra n. 8261, ita quod Ipsi gloria; quod Ipsi soli, 
est quia Dominus est Jehovah in Verbo, {1}n. 8261, ita solus Deus.  In Verbo passim dicitur quod `soli Deo erit gloria et honor'; qui non scit interiora Verbi credere potest quod Dominus velit {2}et amet 
gloriam sicut homo in mundo, etiam ex causa quia Ipsi illa prae omnibus in universo competit; sed Dominus non gloriam {3}vult propter Se, sed propter hominem qui glorificat Illum; homo qui glorificat 
{4}Illum facit id ex sancta veneratione pro Ipso quod supremus sit, et ex humiliatione sui quod respective (t)nihil sit, et quia sic in glorificatione Domini ab homine inest et sancta veneratio et 
humiliatio, homo tunc in statu est recipiendi influxum boni a Domino, ita quoque amorem in Ipsum; inde est quod Dominus velit glorificationem ab homine, videatur n. 4347, 4593, 5957; quod influxus boni 
a Domino sit in cor humile, n. 3994, 7478. 	@1 After Deus$ 	@2 gloriam, et amet illam$ 	@3 amat$ 	@4 Ipsum$ </p>
