<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>609.</strong>由于名为“挪亚”的这个教会，其成员的状态与上古教会成员的状态截然不同，所以他无法象前面说的上古之人那样接受提示和启示。因为他的内在已经关闭，以至于他无法与天堂交流，除了那种无意识的外。由于同样的原因，他也无法受教，除非通过前面所说的外在或感觉的感官途径。因为这个缘故，按照主的天命，信的教义事项，连同赋予上古教会的一些启示被保存起来，以备后世所用。这些教义事项最初通过“该隐”被收聚起来，并得以储存以免丢失。所以，经上论及该隐时就说给他“立一个记号，免得人遇见他就杀他”（对此，请参阅前文，创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创4.15.htm">4:15</a>）。后来，这些教义事项又被“以诺”编撰成教义体系，但由于这类教义对那时的人没有用处，而是要为后世所用，所以经上说“神将他取去”（参阅创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创5.24.htm">5:24</a>）。主为后代或教会所用而保存的，就是这些信的教义事项。因为主预见觉察力将会消失，因此也为这类教义事项存留下去作出规定。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]609.</strong> Again, because humankind's state-of-being in this church called Noah had altered completely from that in the earliest church, the race no longer could be taught or enlightened in the same way as the earliest people had been. The inner pathways were now blocked off, preventing any contact with heaven except that which lay hidden to consciousness. No channel of instruction lay open but the external one through the senses, as just noted.<br />Accordingly, the Lord in his providence saw to it that the teachings of faith would be safeguarded for the use of this generation, along with certain revelations made to the earliest church. Cain was the first to collect these teachings and preserve them against destruction. That is why a mark was said to have been put on him to prohibit his murder. (For more on these things, see the discussion of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_609/bible_king-james-version_genesis_4_15" target=_top>Genesis 4:15</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_609/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_392" target=_top>392-396</a>].) Later, Enoch reduced those teachings into a systematic theology. The theology was not at all useful to the people of that time but only to a generation yet to come, which is why it is said that God took him. (For more, see the discussion of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_609/bible_king-james-version_genesis_5_24" target=_top>Genesis 5:24</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_609/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_521" target=_top>521</a>].) These are the teachings of faith that the Lord saved up for the use of the posterity or the church now being described. The Lord had foreseen that perception would die out and so had provided that the teachings would endure. </p>

As the state of the man of this church which is called "Noah" was altogether changed from that of the man of the Most Ancient Church, he could no longer-as said before-be informed and enlightened in 
the same way as the most ancient man; for his internals were closed, so that he no longer had communication with heaven, except such as was unconscious. Nor, for the same reason, could he be instructed 
except as before said by the external way of sense or of the senses. On this account, of the Lord's providence, doctrinal matters of faith, with some of the revelations to the Most Ancient Church, were 
preserved for the use of this posterity. These doctrinal things were first, collected by "Cain" and were stored up that they might not be lost; and therefore it is said of Cain that a "mark was set 
upon him, lest anyone should slay him" (concerning which see what was said at that place, Gen. 4:15). These doctrinal matters were afterwards reduced into doctrine by "Enoch;" but because this doctrine 
was of use to no one at that time, but was for posterity, it is said that "God took him." (See also Gen. 5:24.) These doctrinal matters of faith are what were preserved by the Lord for the use of 
this posterity or church; for it was foreseen by the Lord that perception would be lost, and therefore it was provided that these doctrinal things should remain. </p>

Since the state of the member of this Church which is called Noah was completely altered from that of the member of the Most Ancient Church, he was no longer able, as has been stated, to be informed 
and enlightened in the way that the most ancient people had been. For internal things had been closed so that he no longer had any communication with heaven apart from that of which he was not immediately 
conscious. As a consequence he could not be taught except by an external or sensory way, which is that of the senses, as has been stated. For this reason, through the Providence of the Lord, doctrinal 
matters concerning faith, together with some of the revelations made to the Most Ancient Church, were preserved for the use of these descendants These matters of doctrine were gathered together 
initially by 'Cain and stored away to prevent their being destroyed. Hence the statement in reference to Cain that 'a sign was set upon him lest anyone should kill him', as may be seen where these matters 
are discussed in Chapter 4:15. Subsequently they were arranged into a doctrinal system by 'Enoch', and since such doctrine was to be used not at that period of time but by descendants, it is therefore 
said that 'God took him'. These matters also may be seen where they are discussed in 5:24. These doctrinal matters concerning faith were what the Lord preserved for the use of these descendants 
or Church. For the Lord foresaw that perception would perish, and therefore also made provision for such matters of doctrine to stay in existence.  </p>

Quia status hominis hujus Ecclesiae, quae 'Noahus' vocatur, prorsus mutatas est a statu hominis Antiquissimae Ecclesiae, non potuit amplius ille, ut dictam, ita informari et illustrari ut antiquissimus 
homo, quia interna clausa erant ut nulla amplius communicatio cum caelo nisi quae ignota; quare nec instrui potuit, nisi quam per viam externam, seu sensuum aut sensualem, ut dictum; propterea, ex 
Providentia Domini, conservata sunt doctrinalia fidei cum quibusdam revelationibus Antiquissimae Ecclesiae in usum hujus posteritatis; quae doctrinalia primum collecta sunt a 'Caino' et reposita ne perirent; 
quare dicitur de Caino quod 'ei signum impositum ne quis illum occideret,' de quibus videantur quae dicta ibi loci, cap. iv 15; postea in doctrinam redacta a 'Hanocho,' quae doctrina, quia illo 
tempore nulli usui esset, sed posteritati, ideo dicitur quod 'sumpserit eum Deus,' de quibus etiam videantur quae ibi loci, cap. v 24. Haec doctrinalia fidei fuerunt quae a Domino conservata sunt in 
usum hujus posteritatis seu Ecclesiae; nam a Domino praevisum quod periret perceptio; quare etiam provisum ut illa remanerent. </p>
