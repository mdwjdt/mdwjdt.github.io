<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8164节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8164.</strong>“他们对摩西说”表试探的顶点，就是绝望之时。这从接下来的话清楚可知，因为“他们说”就包括它们。显而易见，接下来的话是试探的话，这时试探达到顶点，并且有了绝望。之所以说“绝望”，是因为这绝望通常是属灵试探的最后阶段，或在最后阶段到来（参看<a href="1787.htm">1787</a>，<a href="2694.htm">2694</a>，<a href="5279.htm">5279</a>，<a href="5280.htm">5280</a>，<a href="7147.htm">7147</a>，<a href="7155.htm">7155</a>，<a href="7166.htm">7166</a>节）。由于如今很少有人经历属灵的试探，因而它们的性质不为人知，所以我要进一步说一说这个主题。<br />既有属灵的试探或考验，也有属世的试探或考验。属灵的试探属于内在人，但属世的试探属于外在人。属灵的试探有时与属世的试探分开发生，有时与它们一起发生。当一个人在肉体、社会地位和财富，总之在属世生命上受苦，如在患病、遭遇不幸、迫害、惩罚等等中的情形时，它们就是属世的试探。在这些情况下所产生的焦虑就是“属世的试探”所表示的。但这些试探对人的属灵生命没有任何作用；它们也不能称作试探，只能称作痛苦。因为它们是由属世生命所受的伤害造成的，属世生命就是爱自己爱世界的生命。恶人有时也经受这些痛苦，并且越是爱自己爱世界，越从这个源头获得生命，就越备受痛苦和折磨。<br />但属灵的试探属于内在人，并攻击他的属灵生命。在这种情况下，焦虑的存在不是由于属世生命的任何丧失，而是由于信与仁，因而救恩的丧失。这些试探往往通过属世的试探发生，因为如果当一个人正遭受属世的试探，也就是遭受疾病、悲伤、财富或地位的丧失等等时，他开始思想主的帮助，祂的天命，恶人的状态，就是当善人遭遇并承受各种痛苦和损失时，他们得意夸耀、幸灾乐祸的状态，那么属灵的试探就与属世的试探结合在一起。这就是主在客西马尼园，并且当祂忍受最严厉的十字架时的最后试探。由此可见何为属世的试探，何为属灵的试探。还有第三种试探或考验，即大部分由肉体或低层心智的虚弱状态造成的焦虑和抑郁。这种焦虑或包含某种程度的属灵试探，或根本不包含任何属灵试探。</p>

And they said unto Moses. That this signifies the height of temptation when there is despair, is evident from the words that follow, for they are involved in "they said;" that the following words are 
words of temptation, when this comes to its height, and when there is despair, is evident. It is said "despair," because for the most part this is the end, or is at the end, of spiritual temptations 
(see n. 1787, 2694, 5279, 5280, 7147, 7155, 7166). Inasmuch as at this day few undergo spiritual temptations, and consequently it is not known how the case is with temptations, I may say something further 
on the subject. There are spiritual temptations, and there are natural temptations. Spiritual temptations belong to the internal man, but natural ones to the external man. Spiritual temptations sometimes 
arise without natural temptations, sometimes with them. Natural temptations exist when a man suffers as to the body, as to honors, as to wealth, in a word, as to the natural life, as is the case 
in diseases, misfortunes, persecutions, punishments, and the like. The anxieties which then arise, are what are meant by "natural temptations." But these temptations effect nothing whatever toward 
man's spiritual life, neither can they be called temptations, but griefs; for they arise from the wounding of the natural life, which is that of the love of self and of the world. The wicked are sometimes 
in these griefs, and they grieve and are tormented in proportion to the extent of their love of self and of the world, and the life they have from this source.  [2] But spiritual temptations belong 
to the internal man, and assault his spiritual life. In this case the anxieties are not on account of any loss of natural life, but on account of the loss of faith and charity, and consequently of 
salvation. These temptations are frequently induced by means of natural temptations, for if when a man is in these-that is, in disease, grief, the loss of wealth or honor, and the like-he begins to 
think about the Lord's aid, His providence, the state of the evil in that they glory and exult when the good suffer and undergo various griefs and various losses, then spiritual temptation is conjoined 
with natural temptation. Such was the last temptation of the Lord in Gethsemane, and when He suffered the cross, which was the most frightful of all. From all this it is evident what natural temptation 
is, and what spiritual. There is also a third kind, namely, melancholy anxiety, the cause of which is for the most part to be found in an infirm state of the body or of the lower mind. In this anxiety 
there may be something of spiritual temptation, or there may be nothing of it. </p>

'And they said to Moses' means the climax of the temptation, and despair. This is clear from the words that follow, for 'they said' includes them. The fact that the words which follow are words uttered 
in temptation when this has reached its climax and when there is despair is self-evident. The term 'despair' is used because this is usually the final phase or comes within the final phase of spiritual 
temptations, <a href="1787.htm">1787</a>, <a href="2694.htm">2694</a>, <a href="5279.htm">5279</a>, <a href="5280.htm">5280</a>, <a href="7147.htm">7147</a>, <a href="7155.htm">7155</a>, <a href="7166.htm">7166</a>. Since there are few at the present day who undergo spiritual temptations and therefore the nature of them is unknown, let something more be 
said about them. There are spiritual temptations or trials and there are natural temptations or trials. Spiritual temptations belong to the internal man, whereas natural trials belong to the external 
man. Spiritual temptations sometimes occur separately from natural trials, at other times together with them. They are natural trials when a person suffers in ways that affect his physical body, position 
in society, and wealth, in short his natural life, that is, the kinds of sufferings he undergoes when he is sick, unfortunate, persecuted, wrongly punished, and so on. Anxious feelings in such circumstances 
are what are meant by natural trials. But these trials contribute nothing whatever to the person's spiritual life; nor should they be called trials or temptations but miseries. For they arise 
as a result of harm done to his natural life, which is the life of self-love and love of the world. Criminals sometimes endure such miseries; and the more that they love self and the world, and so 
depend on these for their life, the greater is their misery and anguish. </p>

 But spiritual temptations belong to the internal man; they are attacks made on his spiritual life. Anxious feelings in this 
case do not exist on account of any loss in their natural life, but on account of the loss of faith and charity, and consequently of salvation. Natural trials are often the means by which those spiritual 
temptations come about. For if a person is suffering natural trials - that is to say, sickness, sorrow, loss of wealth or position, and so on - and during them comes to think of the Lord's help, 
His Providence, and the state of the wicked, in that they boast and rejoice when the good suffer and endure various miseries and losses, then spiritual temptation is bound up with natural trial. Such 
was the Lord's final temptation, in Gethsemane, and when He endured the Cross, which was the severest of all. From all this one may see what natural trial is and what spiritual temptation is. A third 
kind of temptation or trial also exists, which is anxiety and depression caused for the most part by physical or mental infirmity. Such anxiety may involve some degree of spiritual temptation or it 
may not involve any at all. </p>

`Et dixerunt ad Moschen': quod significet tentationis summum {1}et desperationem, constat ex illis quae sequuntur, nam illa involvuntur in `dixerunt'; quod sequentia verba sint verba tentationis cum 
haec ad summum venit, et cum desperatio, patet; desperatio dicitur quia haec plerumque est finis seu in fine tentationum spiritualium, n. 1787, 2694, 5279, 5280, 7147, 7155, 7166.  Quia hodie pauci sunt 
qui (t)tentationes spirituales subeunt, et inde ignotum quomodo cum illis se habet, {2}aliquid de illis ulterius licet dicere: sunt tentationes spirituales (t)et sunt tentationes naturales; tentationes 
spirituales sunt interni hominis, naturales autem sunt externi; tentationes spirituales quandoque existunt absque tentationibus naturalibus, {3} quandoque cum illis; tentationes naturales sunt cum 
homo patitur quoad corpus, {4} quoad honores, {4} quoad opes, {5}verbo, quoad vitam naturalem, ut fit in morbis, infortuniis, persecutionibus, punitionibus non ex justo, (c)ac similibus; anxietates 
quae tunc existunt sunt quae intelliguntur per tentationes naturales; sed hae tentationes prorsus nihil faciunt ad vitam ejus spiritualem, nec dici possunt tentationes sed {6} dolores; existunt enim 
ex laesione vitae naturalis, quae est amoris sui et mundi; in his {7}doloribus sunt quandoque scelerati, qui (x)eo plus dolent et anguntur, quo plus se et mundum amant, et sic inde vitam habent. 	2 At 
tentationes spirituales sunt interni hominis, et aggrediuntur ejus vitam spiritualem; anxietates tunc non sunt propter aliquam jacturam vitae naturalis, sed propter jacturam fidei et charitatis, et 
consequenter salutis; inducuntur hae tentationes saepe per tentationes naturales, nam cum homo in his est, nempe in morbo, dolore, jactura opum aut honoris, {8} et similibus, si tunc {9}cogitatio venit 
de ope Domini, de Providentia Ipsius, {10}de statu malorum quod glorientur et exultent, cum boni patiuntur, ac (x)varios dolores et varias jacturas subeunt, tunc est tentatio spiritualis conjuncta tentationi 
(x)naturali; talis fuit ultima tentatio Domini, {11} in Gethsemane, et cum crucem passus est, quae fuit omnium atrocissima.  Ex his patet quid tentatio naturalis et quid spiritualis.  Datur 
quoque tertium genus, nempe anxietas melancholica quae ex statu infirmo corporis {12}aut animi ut plurimum causam trahit; illi anxietati potest aliquid (x)tentationis spiritualis inesse, et potest nihil 
ejus inesse. 	@1 cp n. 8158$ 	@2 ulterius de illis aliquid dicendum:$ 	@3 i et$ 	@4 i vel$ 	@5 et in morbis, punitionibus, infortuniis$ 	@6 i modo$ 	@7 anxietatibus possunt esse omnium pessimi$ 	@8
