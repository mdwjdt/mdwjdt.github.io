<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6383节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6383.</strong>“西布伦”表良善与真理的共居。这从“西布伦”的代表清楚可知，“西布伦”是指天上的婚姻（参看<a href="3960.htm">3960</a>，<a href="3961.htm">3961</a>节），因而是指良善与真理结合，因为该结合就是天上的婚姻。之所以说“良善与真理的共居”，是因为在原文，“西布伦”表示共居。此处“西布伦”是指教会中那些利用记忆知识得出关于属灵真理的结论，以此来强化他们对这些真理的理解之人。不过，要知道，“西布伦”不是指那些不相信任何事物，除非记忆知识和感官事物证明它，并且在此之前持否定态度的人。这种人从来就不信，因为在他们的一切思维中普遍掌权的是否定态度；在这种情况下，否认的记忆知识，而非认同、确证的记忆知识就会流入进来，并被这些人收集在一起。他们将用来确证的记忆知识抛到一边，或以支持否定的记忆知识的方式来解释它们，否定态度由此被强化。<br />“西布伦”在此是指那些相信取自圣言的教义，并因此在其一切思维中持某种肯定态度的人。然而，他们的信仰并非存在于真理，而是存在于记忆知识中，因为他们将这些知识用于教义事物，以此强化他们的肯定态度。因此，“西布伦”所表示的人不会将自己从记忆知识当中提升上来；相反，当他们听见或思考信之真理时，就会立刻转而信靠记忆知识。在世上，许多人都是这样；主甚至规定，记忆知识和感官事物要为此目的或功用而服务于他们。</p>

Zebulun. That this signifies the cohabitation of good and truth, is evident from the representation of Zebulun, as being the heavenly marriage (see n. 3960, 3961), thus the conjunction of good and truth, 
for this conjunction is the heavenly marriage. It is said "the cohabitation of good and truth" because in the original language "Zebulon" means "cohabitation." Here under the name of "Zebulon" are 
treated of those in the church who form conclusions about spiritual truths from memory-knowledges, and thus fortify them with themselves. But be it known that by "Zebulun" are not meant those who do 
not believe unless memory-knowledges and sensuous things declare for it, and who are until then in what is negative. Such never believe, for the reason that what is negative reigns universally, and when 
this is the case there flow in and are gathered together memory-knowledges which deny, but not those which confirm; the latter being cast to the sides, or explained to favor the negative memory-knowledges, 
whereby what is negative is fortified. But by "Zebulun" are here meant those who believe doctrinal things from the Word, thus with whom something affirmative reigns universally; and yet their 
faith has not its life in truths, but in memory-knowledges, for they apply these to doctrinal things, and thus fortify their affirmative. They who are "Zebulun," therefore, do not elevate themselves 
from memory-knowledges; but when they hear or think of any truth of faith they at once fall back into memory-knowledge. There are many such in the world, and the Lord provides that memory-knowledges 
and sensuous things may serve them for this use. </p>

'Zebulun' means the dwelling together of goodness and truth. This is clear from the representation of 'Zebulun' as the heavenly marriage, dealt with in <a href="3960.htm">3960</a>, <a href="3961.htm">3961</a>, thus goodness and truth joined together, 
since that conjunction is the heavenly marriage. The words 'the dwelling together of goodness and truth' are used because in the original language 'Zebulun' means a dwelling together. Here 'Zebulun' 
has reference to those within the Church who use the facts they know to draw inferences about spiritual truths and thereby strengthen their grasp of those truths. But it should be recognized that 
'Zebulun' does not mean those people who do not believe something unless they are shown factual and sensory evidence to prove it and who until then have a negative attitude of mind. Such people do not 
ever come to believe it because that negative attitude of mind reigns in all their thinking; and when it reigns in all their thinking, facts which contradict, not those that corroborate, enter in and 
are gathered up by those people. They cast aside facts that may serve to corroborate, or else interpret them in such a way that they lend support to other factual evidence that contradicts the truth. 
Thus the negative attitude becomes all the stronger. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But 'Zebulun' is used here to mean people who believe teachings drawn from the Word and accordingly have something of an affirmative attitude 
in all their thinking. Yet their faith does not exist in truths but in factual knowledge, for they bring such knowledge to bear on those teachings and by doing this strengthen their affirmative attitude. 
The ones who are meant by 'Zebulun' do not therefore go above factual knowledge; rather, when they hear or contemplate any truth of faith they instantly fall back on the facts they know. Many 
in the world are like this; and the Lord even makes provision so that factual knowledge and sensory evidence may serve them to that end. </p>

`Zebulun':  quod significet cohabitationem boni et veri, constat ex repraesentatione `Zebulonis' quod sit conjugium caeleste, de qua n. 3960, 3961, ita conjunctio boni et veri, nam conjunctio {1}illa 
est conjugium caeleste; cohabitatio boni et veri dicitur quia Zebulun in lingua originali significat cohabitationem. Per `Zebulonem' hic agitur de illis in Ecclesia qui concludunt de veris spiritualibus 
ex scientificis, et sic firmant illa apud se; at sciendum quod per `Zebulonem' non intelligantur illi qui non credunt nisi scientifica et sensualia dictent, et qui prius in negativo sunt; illi nusquam 
credunt; causa est quia negativum universaliter regnat, et cum id universaliter regnat, tunc influunt et colliguntur scientifica quae negant, non autem quae confirmant; quae confirmant, ad latus 
rejiciuntur, vel ad favorem scientificorum negantium explicantur, et sic firmatur negativum; [2]sed per `Zebulonem' hic intelliguntur qui credunt doctrinalibus ex Verbo,{2} sic apud quos aliquod affirmativum 
universaliter regnat, et tamen fides non in veris sed in scientificis vitam {3}habet, applicant enim scientifica ad doctrinalia, ac ita firmant affirmativum suum; qui itaque `Zebulun' sunt, non 
elevant se a scientificis, sed cum de aliquo vero fidei audiunt vel cogitant, ilico cadunt in scientificum; tales sunt {4}plures in mundo; etiam providet Dominus ut scientifica et sensualia illis ad 
eum usum serviant. @1 illorum$ @2 i et$ @3 suae fidei habent$ @4 perplures$ </p>
