<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4441节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4441.</strong>“雅各就沉默，等他们回来”表与他及其后代所知的信之真理商议。这从“沉默”和“等他们（即他的儿子）回来”的含义清楚可知：“沉默”是指默默思考，并且自己的意见秘不外宣；“等他们（即他的儿子）回来”是指与属于他及其后代的信之真理商议，“儿子”表示真理（参看<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>，<a href="2623.htm">2623</a>，<a href="3373.htm">3373</a>，<a href="4257.htm">4257</a>节）。既然要与儿子，因而与雅各的儿子所表示的真理商议，那么可知，这是与属于雅各及其后代的真理商议。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4441</b></p><p><b>4441.</b>
And Jacob was silent until they came. That this signifies a consultation from the truths of faith that belonged to him and his descendants, is evident from the signification of "to be silent," as being 
to silently think and take counsel; and from the signification of "until they (that is, the sons) came," as being to do this from the truths of faith that belonged to him and his descendants (that 
"sons" are truths see n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 3373, 4257). As the consultation was made with the sons, thus with the truths signified by the sons of Jacob, it follows that it was from the truths 
that belonged to Jacob and his descendants. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4441</b></p><p><b>4441.</b>
'And Jacob kept silent until they came' means counsel taken with the truths of faith which were known to him and his descendants. This is clear from the meaning of 'keeping silent' as thinking and keeping 
one's own counsel; and from the meaning of 'until they (his sons) came' as counsel taken by the truths of faith which belonged to him and his descendants - 'sons' meaning truths, see <a href="489.htm">489</a>, <a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="533.htm">533</a>, <a href="1147.htm">1147</a>, <a href="2623.htm">2623</a>, <a href="3373.htm">3373</a>, <a href="4257.htm">4257</a>. Since the counsel was to be taken with the sons, and so with the truths meant by 'Jacob's sons', it was therefore a counsel taken with the truths known to him and his descendants. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 4441</b>
</p><b>4441.</b>
`Et tacuit Jacob usque ad venire illos': quod significet consultationem ex veris fidei quae illi et posteris ejus, constat ex significatione `tacere' quod sit cogitare et tacite consultare {1}; et 
ex significatione `usque venire illos,' nempe filios, quod sit ex veris fidei quae illi et posteris ejus; quod `filii' sint vera, videatur n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 3373, 4257; quia cum illis 
consultatio fieret, sic cum veris quae per `filios Jacobi' significantur, proinde ex veris quae illi et posteris ejus.      @1 i apud se$ </p>
