<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4975节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4975.</strong>“又见耶和华使他手里所办的尽都顺利”表一切都是神的旨意。这从“尽都顺利”的含义清楚可知，“尽都顺利”是指被提供，如前所述（<a href="4972.htm">4972</a>节）。因此，“耶和华使他手里所办的尽都顺利”表示神的旨意。<br />4975a.“约瑟就在他眼里蒙恩”表它蒙悦纳，也就是说，它蒙他的“主”所表示的属世良善的悦纳。这从“在某人眼里蒙恩”的含义清楚可知，“在某人眼里蒙恩”是指蒙悦纳。之所以“在眼里”，是因为恩典论及理解力，而理解力由“眼睛”来表示（参看<a href="2701.htm">2701</a>，<a href="3820.htm">3820</a>，<a href="4526.htm">4526</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4975</b></p><p><b>4975.</b>
And that Jehovah made all that he did to prosper in his hand. That this signifies that all things were of the Divine providence, is evident from the signification of "being made to prosper" as being 
to be provided (of which above, n. 4972). Hence "Jehovah's making it to prosper in his hand" denotes the Divine providence. </p>
<p>4975a. And Joseph found grace in his eyes. That this signifies that it was 
accepted, namely, by natural good, which is signified by his "lord," is evident from the signification of "finding grace in one's sight," as being to be accepted. It is said "in the eyes," because grace 
is predicated of the understanding, and this is signified by the "eyes" (see n. 2701, 3820, 4526). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4975</b></p><p><b>4975.</b>
'And everything that he did Jehovah made to prosper in his hand' means that all things were the conferments of Divine Providence. This is clear from the meaning of 'being made to prosper' as being provided 
for, dealt with above in <a href="4972.htm">4972</a>. Consequently 'Jehovah made it prosper in his hand' is Divine Providence. </p>
<p>[<a href="4975.htm">4975</a>a] 'And Joseph found favour in his eyes means that it had found acceptance, that 
is to say, by natural good meant by 'his lord'. This is clear from the meaning of 'finding favour in someone's eyes' as finding acceptance. The expression 'in his eyes' is used because 'favour' has reference 
to the understanding, and this is meant by 'the eyes', <a href="2701.htm">2701</a>, <a href="3820.htm">3820</a>, <a href="4526.htm">4526</a>. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 4975</b>
</p><b>4975.</b>
`Et omne quod is faciens Jehovah prosperans in manu ejus': </p>
<p>quod significet quod omnia ex Providentia Divina, constat ex significatione `prosperari' quod sit provideri, de qua supra n. 4972, inde 
`Jehovah prosperans in manu ejus' est Providentia Divina. {1}`Et invenit Joseph gratiam in oculis ejus': quod significet quod id acceptum esset, nempe bono naturali quod per `dominum ejus' significatur, 
constat ex significatione `invenire gratiam in oculis alicujus' quod sit acceptum esse; `in oculis' dicitur quia gratia praedicatur de intellectuali, et per `oculos' id significatur, n. 2701, 
3820, 4526. @1 A had 4976 but d to suit later renumbering.$  </p>
