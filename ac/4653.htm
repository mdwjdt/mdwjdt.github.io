<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4653节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4653.</strong>与听觉对应，或构成耳朵区域的灵人是那些过着简单的顺从生活的人；也就是说，他们不会推理事情是不是真的，而是相信它就是如此，因为别人就是这么说的。因此，他们可称作“顺从”。他们之所以具有这种性质，是因为听与说的关系如同被动物与主动物的关系，因而就像一个听别人说话并默默接受的人。这也解释了为何在日常用语中，“洗耳恭听”意味着顺从；“倾听某人的声音”也意味着顺从。事实上，人的言语所具有的深层含义很大程度上来源于对应；原因在于，人的灵就在来世的灵人当中，并在那里行使它的思维能力；尽管人自己对此一无所知，而肉体人则不愿知道这一点。<br />4653a.与耳朵，也就是耳朵的功能和职责相对应的灵人多种多样。有些灵人与这个器官的特定部位有关：如有的与外耳有关；有的与被称为耳鼓的鼓膜有关；有的与被称为圆窗的内膜有关；有的与锤骨、镫骨、砧骨、半规管和耳蜗有关。也有些灵人与更内在的部位有关，包括那些更接近灵的非物质或无形部位。最后，有些灵人就在灵本身里面，与那些属于内在视觉的灵人有最内在的联结；他们因不那么敏锐而不同于那些属于内在视觉的灵人，但可以说能被动顺从地支持他们。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4653</b></p><p><b>4653.</b>
The spirits who correspond to the hearing, or who constitute the province of the ear, are those who are in simple obedience, that is, those who do not reason whether a thing is so, but believe it to 
be so because it is said by others to be so: hence they may be called "obediences." The reason of their being such is that the hearing is to speech as the passive is to its active, thus as one who hears 
a speaker and acquiesces. Hence also in common speech, to "give ear to anyone" is to be obedient, and to "hearken to the voice" is to obey; for the interior things of man's speech have in great part 
derived their origin from correspondence, for the reason that man's spirit is among spirits in the other life, and thinks there; although man is altogether ignorant of this, and a corporeal man is not 
willing to know it.      [2] There are many differences among the spirits who correspond to the ear, that is, to its functions and offices. There are those who bear relation to each of its little 
organs-some to the external ear, some to the membrane called the drum of the ear, some to the interior membranes which are called windows, some to the hammer, to the stirrup, to the anvil, the cylinders, 
and the cochlea; and there are those who bear relation to parts still more interior, even to those substantiated parts which are nearer to the spirit, and finally to those which are in the spirit; 
and last of all they are inmostly conjoined with those who belong to the internal sight, from whom they are distinguished by their not having so much discernment, but giving as it were a passive assent to them. </p>

The spirits who correspond to hearing, that is, those who constitute the province of the ear, are ones who lead lives of simple obedience; that is to say, they do not use reason to establish whether 
a thing is true but believe it to be so because others say it is. They may therefore be called 'obediences'. The reason why they are as they are is that the relationship of hearing to speech is like what 
is passive to what is active, and so like a person who hears and acquiesces in what another says. This also explains why in everyday speech hearing someone may mean being obedient to him, and to hearken 
to his voice to obey him. For the deeper meanings which human utterances possess have their origin for the most part in correspondence, the reason being that man's spirit exists among spirits in 
the next life, and exercises its power of thought there, though man himself has no knowledge at all of this and one interested solely in the body has no wish to know it. </p>
<p>[<a href="4653.htm">4653</a>a] There are many different 
kinds of spirits who correspond to the ear, that is, to its functions and duties. There are those who correlate with the specific parts of that organ - those who correlate with the outer ear; 
those who do so with the membrane there which is called the ear-drum, the interior membranes termed fenestrae; and those who correlate with the malleus, the stapes, the incus, the cylinders, and the cochlea. 
There are also those who correlate with parts more interior still, including those immaterial or insubstantial parts that are closer to the spirit. Lastly there are those spirits, within the spirit 
itself, who are linked ultimately - at the most internal point - to spirits belonging to internal sight, from whom they differ in that they themselves are not so discerning, yet, like those who 
are passively obedient, support them. </p>

Spiritus qui auditui correspondent, seu qui auris provinciam constituunt, sunt qui in oboedientia simplici sunt, qui nempe non ratiocinantur num ita sit sed quia ita esse ab aliis dicitur, credunt 
quod ita sit; inde possunt vocari `oboedientiae'; quod illi tales sint, est quia auditus se habet ad loquelam sicut passivum ad activum suum, ita sicut qui audit loquentem et acquiescit; inde etiam 
in communi sermone audiens esse alicui est oboediens esse, et auscultare voci {1} est oboedire; interiora enim sermonis hominis quoad plurem partem a correspondentia traxerunt originem, ex causa quia 
spiritus hominis est inter spiritus qui in altera vita, et ibi cogitat, quod homo prorsus nescit et homo corporeus nec scire vult.      @1 i etiam$ </p>

membranas interiores quae fenestrae dicuntur, qui ad malleum, stapedem, incudem, cylindros, cochleam, et sunt qui ad interiora adhuc, usque ad illa substantiata quae propiora sunt spiritu, et quae 
tandem in spiritu, et ultimo intime conjunguntur cum illis qui pertinent ad visum internum, a quibus distinguuntur per id quod non ita discernant, sed sicut patientes illis {3} adstipulentur.
