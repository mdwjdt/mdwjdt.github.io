<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3757.</strong>然而，很少有人知道亵渎神圣事物是什么意思。不过，这一点从前面对此的阐述和说明可以看出来即：能亵渎神圣事物的，是那些知道、承认并被赋予良善与真理的人，而不是那些不承认的人，更不是那些不知道它们的人（参看<a href="593.htm">593</a>，<a href="1008.htm">1008</a>，<a href="1010.htm">1010</a>，<a href="1059.htm">1059</a>，<a href="3398.htm">3398</a>节）。因此，教会中人有可能亵渎神圣事物，而教会之外的人则不可能（<a href="2051.htm">2051</a>节）。属天教会成员有可能亵渎神圣良善，属灵教会成员有可能亵渎神圣真理（<a href="3399.htm">3399</a>节）。所以内层真理没有透露给犹太人，以免他们亵渎之（<a href="3398.htm">3398</a>节）。外邦人最不可能亵渎它们（<a href="2051.htm">2051</a>节）。亵渎就是将良善与邪恶，以及真理与虚假混合并联结起来（<a href="1001.htm">1001</a>，<a href="1003.htm">1003</a>，<a href="2426.htm">2426</a>节）；这一点由吃血来表示，吃血在犹太教会是严厉禁止的（<a href="1003.htm">1003</a>节）。因此，人们尽可能地远离对良善和真理的承认和信仰，除非他们能稳定地留在其中（<a href="3398.htm">3398</a>，<a href="3402.htm">3402</a>节）；因此缘故，他们被保守在无知当中（<a href="301.htm">301</a>-<a href="303.htm">303</a>节）；他们的敬拜也变得外在（<a href="1327.htm">1327</a>，<a href="1328.htm">1328</a>节）。内在真理不会被揭示出来，除非教会已经荒废，因为那时，良善与真理再无法遭到亵渎（<a href="3398.htm">3398</a>，<a href="3399.htm">3399</a>节）。因此，一旦出现这种情况，主就会降世（<a href="3398.htm">3398</a>节）。亵渎神圣事物和圣言会面临巨大的危险（<a href="571.htm">571</a>，<a href="582.htm">582</a>节）。</p>

But as regards the profanation of what is holy, few know what it is; yet this can be seen from what has been already stated and shown concerning it, namely, that those are able to profane holy things 
who know, acknowledge, and become imbued with good and truth; but not those who do not acknowledge, and still less those who do not know them (see n. 593, 1008, 1010, 1059, 3398): Thus that they who 
are within the church can profane holy things, but not they who are without it (n. 2051): That they who are of the celestial church can profane holy goods, and that they who are of the spiritual church 
can profane holy truths (n. 3399): That therefore interior truths were not disclosed to the Jews, lest they should profane them (n. 3398): That the Gentiles can least of all profane (n. 2051): That 
profanation is a commingling and conjunction of good and evil, and also of truth and falsity (n. 1001, 1003, 2426): That this was signified by the eating of blood, which was so severely prohibited in 
the Jewish Church (n. 1003): That therefore insofar as possible men are withheld from the acknowledgment and faith of good and truth, unless they are able to remain therein (n. 3398, 3402); and that on 
this account they are kept in ignorance (n. 301-303); and that worship also becomes external (n. 1327, 1328): That internal truths are not revealed until the church has been vastated, because then good 
and truth can no longer be profaned (n. 3398, 3399): That this was the reason why the Lord then first came into the world (n. 3398): How great a danger there is from the profanation of what is holy 
and of the Word (n. 571, 582).            GENESIS 29 </p>
<p>     1. And Jacob lifted up his feet, and went to the land of the sons of the east.      2. And he saw, and behold a well in the field, and 
behold there three droves of the flock lying by it; for out of that well they watered the droves; and a great stone was upon the well's mouth.      3. And all the droves were gathered together thither; 
and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock, and they put the stone in its place again upon the well's mouth.      4. And Jacob said unto them, My brethren whence are ye? 
And they said, We are from Haran.      5. And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.      6. And he said unto them, Hath he peace? And they said, Peace; and 
behold Rachel his daughter cometh with the flock.      7. And he said, Behold as yet the day is great, it is not time for the cattle to be gathered together: water ye the flock, and go and feed them.  
    8. And they said, We cannot until all the droves are gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then shall we water the flock.      9. While he was yet speaking with them, 
Rachel came with the flock which was her father's, for she was a shepherdess.      10. And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the flock of Laban 
his mother's brother, that Jacob came near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.      11. And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice 
and wept.      12. And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son; and she ran and told her father.      13. And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings 
of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house; and he told Laban all these things.      14. And Laban said to him, Surely thou 
art my bone and my flesh. And he dwelt with him a month of days.      15. And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? Tell me, what shall be thy 
reward?      16. And Laban had two daughters, the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.      17. And Leah's eyes were weak, and Rachel was beautiful in form and beautiful 
in look.      18. And Jacob loved Rachel, and he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.      19. And Laban said, It is better that I should give her to thee than 
give her to another man; abide with me.      20. And Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they were in his eyes as a few days, for the love he had to her.      21. And Jacob said unto Laban, Give 
me my woman, for my days are fulfilled, and I will come to her.      22. And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.      23. And it came to pass in the evening, that he 
took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him, and he came to her.      24. And Laban gave her Zilpah his handmaid, unto his daughter Leah for a handmaid.      25. And it came to pass in the morning 
that behold it was Leah; and he said unto Laban, What is this that thou hast done unto me? Did not I serve with thee for Rachel? And why hast thou defrauded me?      26. And Laban said, It is not 
so done in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn.      27. Fulfill this week, and we will give thee her also, for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.    
  28. And Jacob did so, and fulfilled this week, and he gave him Rachel his daughter for a woman.      29. And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be to her for a handmaid.     
 30. And he came also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.      31. And Jehovah saw that Leah was hated, and He opened her womb, and Rachel 
was barren.      32. And Leah conceived and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben, for she said, Because Jehovah hath seen my affliction, for now my man will love me.      33. And she conceived 
again, and bare a son, and said, Because Jehovah hath heard that I was hated, and hath given me this one also; and she called his name Simeon.      34. And she conceived again, and bare a son, and 
said, Now this time will my man cleave to me, because I have borne him three sons; therefore she called his name Levi.      35. And she conceived again, and bare a son, and she said, This time I will 
confess Jehovah; therefore she called his name Judah; and she stood still from bearing. </p>

Few however know what is meant by profaning that which is holy. But this may be seen by looking at what has been stated and shown already - </p>
<p> Those who know, acknowledge, and are endowed with good and 
truth are able to profane these, but not those who have not acknowledged them, still less those who do not know them, <a href="593.htm">593</a>, <a href="1008.htm">1008</a>, <a href="1010.htm">1010</a>, <a href="1059.htm">1059</a>, <a href="3398.htm">3398</a>. </p>
<p>So it is possible for those inside the Church to 
profane holy things but not those outside it, <a href="2051.htm">2051</a>. </p>
<p>It is possible for members of the celestial Church to profane any holy good, and for members of the spiritual Church to profane any holy truth, <a href="3399.htm">3399</a>. </p>
<p>To the Jews therefore interior truths were not disclosed, lest they profaned them, <a href="3398.htm">3398</a>. </p>
<p>Least of all are gentiles able to profane them, <a href="2051.htm">2051</a>. </p>
<p>Profanation is mixing and linking good and 
evil together, and also truth and falsity together, <a href="1001.htm">1001</a>, <a href="1003.htm">1003</a>, <a href="2426.htm">2426</a>. </p>
<p>It was meant by eating blood, something strictly forbidden in the Jewish Church, <a href="1003.htm">1003</a>. </p>
<p>People are therefore withheld as far 
as possible from an acknowledgement of and a faith in what is good and true if they are unable to remain steadfast in the same, <a href="3398.htm">3398</a>, <a href="3402.htm">3402</a>, and are therefore kept in ignorance, <a href="301.htm">301</a>-<a href="303.htm">303</a>; and their worship 
also becomes external, <a href="1327.htm">1327</a>, <a href="1328.htm">1328</a>. </p>
<p>Internal truths are not revealed until the Church has undergone vastation, for at that point it is no longer possible for good and truth to be rendered profane, 
<a href="3398.htm">3398</a>, <a href="3399.htm">3399</a>. </p>
<p>As soon as this was the case therefore the Lord came into the world, <a href="3398.htm">3398</a>. </p>
<p>How much danger lies in profaning the Word and that which is holy, <a href="571.htm">571</a>, <a href="582.htm">582</a>. </p>

<p>CAPUT XXIX 1. 
 Et sustulit Jacob pedes suos, et ivit terram filiorum orientis. 2.  Et vidit, et ecce puteus in agro, et ecce ibi tres catervae gregis cubantes juxta illum, quia e puteo illo potarunt catervas; </p>
<p>et 
lapis magnus super ore putei. 3.  Et colligebantur illuc omnes catervae, et devolvebant lapidem a super ore putei, et potabant gregem; et reducebant lapidem super os putei ad locum ejus. 4.  Et 
dixit illis Jacob, Fratres mei, unde vos? et dixerunt, E Harane nos. 5.  Et dixit illis, An cognoscitis Labanem filium Nahoris? et dixerunt, Cognoscimus. 6.  Et dixit illis, An pax ei? et dixerunt, 
Pax, et ecce Rachel filia ejus venit cum grege. 7.  Et dixit, Ecce adhuc dies magnus, non tempus colligi pecudes, potate gregem, et ite, pascite. 8.  Et dixerunt, Non possumus, usque quod colligantur 
omnes catervae, et devolvant lapidem a super ore putei, et potabimus gregem. 9.  Adhuc ille loquens cum illis, et Rachel venit cum grege, qui patri ejus, quia pastor illa. 10.  Et fuit, ut 
vidit Jacob Rachelem filiam Labanis fratris matris suae, et gregem Labanis fratris matris suae, et accessit Jacob, et devolvit lapidem a super ore putei, et potavit gregem Labanis fratris matris 
suae. 11.  Et osculatus est Jacob Rachelem, et sustulit vocem suam et flevit. 12.  Et indicabat Jacob Racheli, quod frater patris ejus ille, et quod filius Rebeccae ille; et cucurrit et indicavit 
patri suo. 13.  Et fuit, sicut audivit Laban famam Jacobi filii sororis suae, et cucurrit obviam ei, et amplexus eum, et osculatus eum, et adduxit eum ad domum suam, et narravit Labani omnia verba 
illa. 14.  Et dixit ei Laban, Utique os meum et caro mea tu, et habitavit cum eo mensem dierum. 15.  Et dixit Laban Jacobo, Num quia frater meus tu, et servires mihi gratis? indica mihi, quid merces 
tua? 16.  Et Labani duae filiae, nomen majoris Leah, et nomen minoris Rachel. 17.  Et oculi Leae debiles, et Rachel erat pulchra forma, et pulchra aspectu. 18.  Et amabat Jacob Rachelem, et dixit, 
Serviam tibi septem annis pro Rachele filia tua minore. 19.  Et dixit Laban, Bonum dare me illam tibi, prae dare illam viro alii, mane cum me. 20.  Et servivit Jacob pro Rachele septem annis; 
et fuerunt in oculis ejus sicut dies aliqui in amando illo eam. 21.  Et dixit Jacob ad Labanem, Da mulierem meam, quia impleti dies mei, et veniam ad illam. 22.  Et collegit Laban omnes viros loci, 
et fecit convivium. 23.  Et fuit in vespera, et accepit Leam filiam suam, et adduxit illam ad eum, et venit ad illam. 24.  Et dedit Laban illi Zilpam ancillam suam, Leae filiae suae ancillam. 25. 
 Et fuit in mane, et ecce illa Leah, et dixit ad Laban, Quid hoc fecisti mihi? nonne pro Rachele servivi cum te? et quare fraudasti me? 26.  Et dixit Laban, Non fit ita in loco nostro, dare minorem 
natu ante primogenitam. 27.  Imple septimanam hanc, et dabimus tibi etiam illam, in servitium quod servias cum me adhuc septem annis aliis. 28.  Et fecit Jacob ita, et implevit septimanam hanc, 
et dedit ei Rachelem filiam suam ei in mulierem. 29.  Et dedit Laban Racheli filiae suae Bilham ancillam suam illi ad ancillam. 30.  Et venit etiam ad Rachelem, et amavit etiam Rachelem prae Leah, 
et servivit cum eo adhuc septem annis aliis. 31.  Et vidit JEHOVAH quod exosa Leah, et aperuit uterum illius, et Rachel sterilis. 32. Et concepit Leah, et peperit filium, et vocavit nomen ejus Reuben, 
quia dixit, quod vidit JEHOVAH afflictionem meam, quia nunc amabit me vir meus. 33. Et concepit adhuc, et peperit filium, et dixit, Quia audivit JEHOVAH quod exosa ego, et dedit mihi etiam 
hunc, et vocavit nomen ejus Shimeon. 34. Et concepit adhuc, et peperit filium, et dixit, Nunc hac vice adhaerebit vir meus ad me, quia peperi ei tres filios; propterea vocavit nomen ejus Levi. 35. 
Et concepit adhuc, et peperit filium, et dixit, Hac vice confitebor JEHOVAM; propterea vocavit nomen ejus Jehudah; et substitit a pariendo. </p>
