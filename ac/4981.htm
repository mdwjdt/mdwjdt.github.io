<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4981节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4981.</strong>“都蒙耶和华赐福”表增多。这从“耶和华赐福”的含义清楚可知。就真正意义而言，“耶和华赐福”表示对主之爱和对邻之仁；事实上，那些被赋予这些的人被称为“蒙耶和华赐福”，因为在这种情况下，他们被赋予天堂和永恒的救恩。所以，就外在意义，或与人在世间的状态有关的意义而言，“蒙耶和华赐福”是指在神里面满足，因而满足于自己的社会地位和所拥有的财富，无论他是高贵富有的人，还是不那么高贵的穷人。因为凡在神里面满足的人都视地位和财富为实现功用的手段；当思想他们，同时思想永生时，他视它们如无物，视永生则为必不可少的本质。<br />由于就真正意义而言，“蒙耶和华赐福”或蒙主赐福暗含这种增多，所以“赐福”还包含无数其它好处，因而表示从它流入的各种恩赐，如：富有属灵和属天的良善（<a href="981.htm">981</a>，<a href="1731.htm">1731</a>节）；由对真理的情感所结的硕果（<a href="2846.htm">2846</a>节）；被重新排列为天堂的次序（<a href="3017.htm">3017</a>节）；富有爱之良善，由此与主结合（<a href="3406.htm">3406</a>，<a href="3504.htm">3504</a>，<a href="3514.htm">3514</a>，<a href="3530.htm">3530</a>，<a href="3584.htm">3584</a>节）；以及喜乐（<a href="4216.htm">4216</a>节）。因此，从前后文的内容清楚可知“赐福”具体表示什么。此处“蒙耶和华赐福”表示在良善与真理，或生活和教义上的增多，这一点从接下来的话明显看出来，因为经上说“无论在家里的，还是在田里的，都蒙耶和华赐福”，“家”表示系生活良善的良善；而“田”表示系教义真理的真理。由此明显可知，此处“蒙耶和华赐福”表示在这些事物上的增多。</p>

And the blessing of Jehovah. That this signifies increasings, is evident from the signification of the "blessing of Jehovah." The "blessing of Jehovah" in the genuine sense signifies love to the Lord 
and charity toward the neighbor; for they who are gifted with these are called the "blessed of Jehovah," being then gifted with heaven and eternal salvation. Hence the "blessing of Jehovah," in the external 
sense or in the sense which relates to the state of man in the world, is to be content in God, and thence to be content with the state of honor and wealth in which one is, whether it be among 
the honored and rich, or among the less honored and poor; for he who is content in God regards honors and riches as means for uses; and when he thinks of them and at the same time of eternal life, he 
regards the honor and riches as of no importance, and eternal life as essential. Because the "blessing of Jehovah," or of the Lord, in the genuine sense involves these things, "blessing" also contains 
numberless things within it, and hence signifies various things which follow therefrom; as to be enriched with spiritual and celestial good (n. 981, 1731); to be made fruitful from the affection of truth 
(n. 2846); to be disposed in heavenly order (n. 3017); to be gifted with the good of love, and so to be conjoined with the Lord (n. 3406, 3504, 3514, 3530, 3584); and joy (n. 4216). What therefore 
"blessing" signifies specifically may be seen from the series of the things that precede and that follow. That here the "blessing of Jehovah" signifies increasings in good and truth, or in life and 
doctrine, is plain from the words that follow, for it is said "the blessing of Jehovah was in the house and in the field," and by a "house" is signified the good which is of the life, and by a "field" 
the truth which is of doctrine. From this it is plain that increasings in these things is here signified by the "blessing of Jehovah." </p>

'And the blessing of Jehovah was' means increases. This is clear from the meaning of 'the blessing of Jehovah'. In the genuine sense 'the blessing of Jehovah' means love to the Lord and charity towards 
the neighbour, for those who are endowed with these are called 'the blessed of Jehovah' since they are in that case endowed with heaven and eternal salvation. Consequently 'the blessing of Jehovah' 
in the external sense, that is, in the sense which has to do with a person's state in the world, means resting content in God and on that account being content with one's position in society and with 
the amount of wealth one possesses, whether one is among the highly honoured and is wealthy or among the not so honoured and the poor. For the person who rests content in God regards positions and wealth 
as means to fulfill useful purposes; and when he thinks about these and at the same time about eternal life, he rates them as nothing and eternal life as that which is essential. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Because 'the 
blessing of Jehovah (or the Lord)' implies such increases in the genuine sense, blessing also implies countless other benefits and consequently means the various gifts which flow from it, such as 
enrichment with spiritual and celestial good, <a href="981.htm">981</a>, <a href="1731.htm">1731</a>; fruitfulness resulting from the affection for truth, <a href="2846.htm">2846</a>; undergoing rearrangement into heavenly order, <a href="3017.htm">3017</a>; being endowed with the good of love 
and thereby being joined to the Lord, <a href="3406.htm">3406</a>, <a href="3504.htm">3504</a>, <a href="3514.htm">3514</a>, <a href="3530.htm">3530</a>, <a href="3584.htm">3584</a>; and joy, <a href="4216.htm">4216</a>. What is meant by 'blessing' therefore in any specific instance becomes clear from the context in which it appears. 
Here the meaning of 'the blessing of Jehovah' as increases in good and truth, that is, in life and doctrine, is evident from what follows it, for there it says that this blessing of Jehovah was 'in 
the house and in the field', and 'house' means good which is the good of life, while 'field' means truth which is the truth of doctrine. From this it is evident that increases in these are meant in this 
case by 'the blessing of Jehovah'. </p>

</p><b>4981.</b>
`Et fuit benedictio Jehovae': quod significet incrementa, constat ex significatione `benedictionis Jehovae'; benedictio Jehovae in genuino sensu significat amorem in Dominum et charitatem erga proximum, 
qui enim illis donantur, vocantur benedicti Jehovae, donantur enim tunc caelo et salute aeterna; inde `benedictio Jehovae' in sensu externo seu respectivo ad statum hominis in mundo, est contentus 
esse in Deo, et inde contentus esse honoris et opulentiae statu in quo et, sive inter honoratos et divites sit, sive inter minus honoratos et pauperes; qui enim contentus est in Deo, honores 
et divitias spectat ut media usuum, et cum cogitat de illis et simul de vita aeterna, tunc illi nihili facit, et hanc essentialem.  [2] Quia `benedictio Jehovae' seu Domini illa in genuino sensu 
involvit, etiam benedictio innumerabilia in se continet, et inde significat varia quae sunt consequentia, sicut locupletari bono spirituali et caelesti, n. 981, 1731; fructificari ex affectione veri, 
n. 2846; disponi in ordinem caelestem, n. 3017; </p>
<p>donari bono amoris, et sic conjungi Domino, n. (x)3406, 3504, 3514, 3530, 3584; gaudium, n. 4216; quid itaque in specie significat, constare potest 
ex serie antecedentium et consequentium; quod hic `benedictio Jehovae' significet incrementa in bono et vero, seu in vita et doctrina, patet (c)ab illis quae sequuntur, dicitur enim, `fuit benedictio 
Jehovae in domo et in agro', et per `domum' significatur bonum quod est vitae, et per `agrum' verum quod est doctrinae; inde patet quod incrementa in illis hic per `benedictionem Jehovae' significentur. </p>
