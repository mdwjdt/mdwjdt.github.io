<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7251.</strong>关于这些人，我还被告知，他们生活在自己星球上时就相信某个至高无上的造物主，无需一个中保。这些人就是经历消磨，最终得救的人；他们首先被教导，然后接受这个教导：主是独一神，救主和中保。我听见他们声称，没有一个中保，他们不可能得救，因为他们是污秽、不配的。我也看见他们当中一些人在最后的痛苦结束后，被提入天堂；当他们在天堂被接纳时，我从他们身上感受到一种如此温柔的喜悦，以致我的眼泪夺眶而出。</p>

I have also been told about them that when they lived on their earth they believed in a Supreme Creator, without a Mediator. These are they who are so vastated, and finally saved, when they have first 
been instructed and have received the instruction that the Lord is the only God, Savior, and Mediator. I have heard them confess that without a Mediator it would be impossible for them to be saved, 
because they are filthy and unworthy. I have also seen some of them, after suffering to the utmost, taken up into heaven, and when they were received there, I observed from them such a tenderness of gladness 
as drew tears from my eyes. </p>

I have also been told regarding those people that when they lived on their planet they believed in some kind of Supreme Creator, but without a Mediator. These are the ones who undergo that kind of vastation, 
and are finally saved, having first been taught and accepted that the Lord is the only God, Saviour, and Mediator. I have heard them declaring that without the Mediator they could never be saved 
since they are defiled and unworthy. I have also seen some of them raised into heaven after their last sufferings were over, and when they were received there I experienced such exquisite gladness 
in them that it brought tears to my eyes. </p>

</p><b>7251.</b>
De illis quoque dictum est quod cum in sua tellure vixerunt, crediderint in quendam summum Creatorem, absque Mediatore; hi sunt qui ita vastantur et demum salvantur dum prius instructi sint et receperint 
quod Dominus sit solus Deus, Salvator, et Mediator; audivi illos confitentes quod absque Mediatore nusquam salvari possent quia spurci et indigni.  Vidi etiam quosdam illorum, postquam extrema passi 
sunt, sublatos in caelum, et cum ibi recepti sunt, appercepi teneritudinem laetitiae ab illis talem ut exprimeret lacrimas ex oculis meis. </p>
