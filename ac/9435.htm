<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9435节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9435.</strong>“摩西进入云中间”表外在意义上的圣言。这从“摩西”的代表清楚可知。“摩西”是指圣言，在此是指外在意义上的圣言，因为经上说，他“进入云中间”；“云”表示圣言的外在意义。“摩西”代表圣言（参看<a href="9414.htm">9414</a>节），“云”表示圣言的外在意义（<a href="9430.htm">9430</a>节）。摩西在山脚呆了六天，到了第七天，他受到呼召，走进云中，上了山。这样做是为了让他能代表百姓和主之间的一个媒介，正如前面所述（<a href="9414.htm">9414</a>节）。从百姓上升到主那里的台阶就是被如此描述的。当摩西最终上了山时，他首次代表圣言的外在圣洁，这外在圣洁就是那充当媒介的；因为西乃山表示天堂，圣洁就住在那里。然而，他只被允许进入天堂的第一道门槛处，即最外层，圣言的外在圣洁就在那里终止。他只被允许进入那么远的地方，这一点通过一个灵人以一种代表性的方式被指给我看；这个灵人脸的上半部分直到下巴出现在天堂之光中，而下半部分，包括下巴，连同整个身体，却在云中。由此明显可知，摩西代表了多少作为媒介的外在圣洁。摩西在山脚所停留的六天表示真理的状态，他上山之时的第七天表示良善的状态，正如前面所解释的（<a href="9431.htm">9431</a>，<a href="9432.htm">9432</a>节）。原因在于，那些正在被主重生的人以同等程度从世界攀升到天堂。此人从外在事物被提升到内在事物，因为他从外在事物所在的属世人的层次被提升到内在事物所在的属灵人的层次。这种提升或上升也由取得作为媒介的外在圣洁的代表之时的摩西来代表；因为圣言的外在圣洁是进入良善状态，因而进入天堂的入口。</p>

And Moses entered into the midst of the cloud. That this signifies the Word in the external sense, is evident from the representation of Moses, as being the Word, here the Word in the external sense, 
because it is said that he "entered into the midst of the cloud," and by "the cloud" is signified the external sense of the Word. (That "Moses" denotes the Word, see n. 9414; and that a "cloud" denotes 
its external sense, n. 9430.) That Moses remained for six days in the uttermost of the mountain, and that when called on the seventh day he entered into the cloud and went up unto the mountain, was 
done in order that he might represent an intermediate, or that which mediates between the people and the Lord, according to what was said above (n. 9414). The steps of ascent from the people to the Lord 
are thus described. When at last he came into the mountain, he then for the first time represented the holy external of the Word, which is what mediates; for this mountain signifies heaven, where 
is holiness. And yet he was not admitted further than to the first threshold of heaven, where the holy external of the Word ceases. How far he was admitted, was shown me representatively by a spirit, 
who as to the higher part of the face as far as the chin was seen in the light of heaven, but as to the lower part of it, including the chin, and as to the whole body with it, was in a cloud. From this 
it was made plain how much he represented of the holy external, which is what mediates. The six days during which Moses remained in the extremity of the mountain, signified a state of truth, and the 
seventh day, on which he went up into the mountain, signified a state of good (according to what was unfolded above, n. 9431, 9432). The reason is, that with those who are being regenerated by the Lord 
there are similar degrees of ascent from the world to heaven; for a man is elevated from external to internal things; because from the natural man who is in external things to the spiritual man who 
is in internal things. Such an elevation or ascent was also represented by Moses when he put on the representation of the holy external, which mediates; for the holy external of the Word is the entrance 
to a state of good, thus to heaven. </p>

'And Moses went into the midst of the cloud' means the Word in its outward sense. This is clear from the representation of 'Moses' as the Word, at this point the Word in its outward sense since it says 
that he went 'into the midst of the cloud', and 'the cloud' means the outward sense of the Word. For the representation of 'Moses' as the Word, see above in <a href="9414.htm">9414</a>, and for the meaning of 'the cloud' 
as its outward sense, in <a href="9430.htm">9430</a>. Moses remained at the foot of the mountain for six days, and then on the seventh day he received the call and went into the cloud, up into the mountain. This happened in 
order that he might represent that which acted as an intermediary between the people and the Lord, in keeping with what has been stated above in <a href="9414.htm">9414</a>. Degrees of ascent from the people to the Lord are 
described by this. When Moses went eventually into the mountain he first represented the outward holiness of the Word, which acted as an intermediary; for that mountain means heaven, where holiness 
dwells. But he was allowed no further in than the outermost part of heaven, where the outward holiness of the Word comes to an end. His being allowed only that far in has been demonstrated to me in a 
representative manner by means of a spirit, the upper part of whose face down to the chin appeared in the light of heaven, while the lower part from the chin downwards, together with the whole of the 
body, was in a cloud. This showed me how much of the outward holiness, which acted as an intermediary, Moses represented. The reason why the six days that Moses remained at the foot of the mountain has 
meant the state of truth, and the seventh day when he went up into the mountain means the state of good, in keeping with the explanation above in <a href="9431.htm">9431</a>, <a href="9432.htm">9432</a>, is that those who are being regenerated 
by the Lord mount by like degrees of ascent from the world into heaven. The person is raised from outward things to inward ones, because he is raised from the level of natural man, where outward things 
exist, to that of the spiritual man, where inward things exist. This kind of raising or ascent was also represented by Moses when he took on the representation of the outward holiness that acted as 
an intermediary. For the outward holiness of the Word is the gateway to the state of good, and so to heaven.  </p>

`Et intravit Moscheh in medium nubis': quod significet Verbum in sensu externo, constat (c)a repraesentatione `Moschis' quod sit Verbum, hic Verbum in sensu externo, quia dicitur quod intraverit `in 
medium nubis,' et per `nubem' significatur sensus externus Verbi; quod `Moscheh' sit Verbum, videatur supra n. 9414, et quod `nubes' sit sensus ejus externus, n. 9430.  Quod Moscheh manserit in extremo 
montis sex dies, et die septimo vocatus intraverit in {1}nubem, et ascenderit ad montem, factum est ob causam ut repraesentaret intermedium seu medians inter populum et inter Dominum, secundum illa 
quae supra n. 9414 dicta sunt; gradus ascensionis a populo ad Dominum ita describuntur; cum tandem venit in montem, tunc primum repraesentabat sanctum Verbi externum, quod est medians, nam mons ille 
significat caelum, ubi sanctum; sed usque non ulterius admissus est quam ad primum limen caeli ubi sanctum Verbi externum desinit; quousque admissus est, repraesentative mihi ostensum est per spiritum 
qui quoad superiorem faciei partem usque ad mentum in luce caeli visus est, {2}at quoad inferiorem a mento, et una quoad totum corpus, in nube fuit; inde patuit quantum sancti externi, quod medians, 
repraesentavit. {3}Quod sex dies quibus Moscheh mansit in extremo montis significaverint statum veri, et septimus quo ascendit ad montem, statum boni, secundum illa quae supra n. 9431, 9432, explicata 
sunt, causa est quia similes gradus ascensionis a mundo ad caelum sunt illis qui regenerantur a Domino; elevatur enim homo ab externis ad interna, quia a naturali homine qui in externis est, ad spiritualem 
qui in internas; talis elevatio seu ascensio quoque repraesentabatur per Moschen cum indueret repraesentationem sancti externi, quod medians; sanctum enim Verbi externum est introitus ad statum 
boni, ita ad caelum. @1 medium nubis$ @2 et$ @3 The remainder of this was written on a separate sheet which has not been preserved.$ </p>
