<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1919节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1919.</strong>“亚伯兰对撒莱说”表直觉。这从前面所述（<a href="1898.htm">1898</a>节）清楚可知。“亚伯兰对撒莱说”代表和表示主的直觉，而“撒莱对亚伯兰说”则表示源于这直觉的思维，直觉是思维的源头。拥有直觉的人所具有的思维并非出自其它源头。然而，直觉是一回事，思维是另一回事。为了说明这一事实，以良知为例。<br />良知是对从主经由天堂所流入之物的一种普遍、因而模糊的指示。所流入的那些事物会显现在内在理性人中，在那里可以说笼罩在云层中。这云层来自有关信之真理与良善的表象和谬论（或幻觉）。然而，思维不同于良知，但它从良知流出。因为凡有良知的人都照着良知思考和说话，思维有点象将构成良知的事物展开，从而将它们分割成各个观念，然后转换成话语之物。正因如此，主将那些有良知的人保守在对邻舍的良善思维中，并阻止他们思想邪恶。因此，良知只存在于爱邻如己，并具有关于信之真理的良善思维之人身上。上述分析表明良知如何不同于思维，并由此可知直觉如何不同于思维。<br />主的直觉直接来自耶和华，因而来自神性良善。而祂的思维则来自智性真理和对它的情感，如前所述（<a href="1904.htm">1904</a>，<a href="1914.htm">1914</a>节）。主的神性直觉无法以任何概念来理解，甚至无法以天使的概念来理解，所以它无法描述。与主的直觉相比，天使的直觉 （参看<a href="1354.htm">1354</a>节等，<a href="1394.htm">1394</a>，<a href="1395.htm">1395</a>节）等同于没有。主的直觉因是神性，故是对天上万事万物的一种直觉，因而也是对地上万事万物的一种直觉。因为秩序、关联和流注是这样：凡对天上万事万物有直觉的人，对地上万事万物也有直觉。<br />但是，主的人性本质与神性本质融合，同时变成耶和华后，这时，主就超越了所谓的直觉之物，因为祂超越了存在于天上，并由此存在于地上的秩序。耶和华就是秩序的源头，因此可以说，耶和华是秩序本身。因为祂凭自己掌管秩序，不只是象人们所以为的那样在普遍上掌管，还在最具体的个体上掌管，因为普遍是由这些个体构成的。谈论普遍，然后却又将这类个体从它那里分离出去，无异于在谈论一个没有部分的整体，因而无异于在谈论内中空无一物的事物。因此，声称主的治理是普遍的，但不是具体个体的，这纯粹是虚假，是所谓的无对象之空虚概念。因为普遍而非具体地提供和治理，就等于完全没有提供和治理任何东西。这在哲学上是正确的，然而，说来奇怪，哲学家们自己，甚至包括最杰出的，却以不同的方式理解和思考这个问题。</p>

Abram said unto Sarai. That this signifies perception, is evident from what was said above (n. 1898). The Lord's perception was represented and is here signified by this which Abram said to Sarai; but 
His thought from the perception, by that which Sarai said to Abram. The thought was from the perception. They who are in perception think from nothing else; but still perception is one thing and thought 
another. To show that this is the case, take conscience as an illustration.  [2] Conscience is a kind of general dictate, and thus an obscure one, of the things that flow in through the heavens 
from the Lord. Those which flow in present themselves in the interior rational man and are there as in a cloud, which cloud is from appearances and fallacies concerning the truths and goods of faith. 
But thought is distinct from conscience, and yet it flows from conscience; for they who have conscience think and speak according to it, and the thought is little else than an unfolding of the things 
which are of conscience, and thereby the partition of them into ideas and then into words. Hence it is that they who have conscience are kept by the Lord in good thoughts respecting the neighbor, and 
are withheld from thinking evil; and therefore conscience can have no place except with those who love their neighbor as themselves, and think well concerning the truths of faith. From what has been advanced 
we may see what the difference is between conscience and thought; and from this we may know what the difference is between perception and thought.  [3] The Lord's perception was immediately from 
Jehovah, and thus from the Divine good; but His thought was from intellectual truth and the affection of it, as before said (n. 1904, 1914). The Lord's Divine perception cannot be apprehended by any 
idea, not even of angels, and therefore it cannot be described. The perception of the angels (spoken of n. 1354, etc., 1394, 1395) is scarcely anything in comparison with the perception which the Lord 
had. The Lord's perception, being Divine, was a perception of all things in the heavens, and therefore also of all things on earth, for such is the order, connection, and influx, that he who is in 
the perception of the former is also in the perception of the latter.  [4] But after the Lord's Human Essence had been united to His Divine Essence, and at the same time had become Jehovah, the Lord 
was then above that which is called perception, because He was above the order that is in the heavens and thence on the earth. It is Jehovah who is the source of order, and hence it may be said that 
Jehovah is Order itself, for He from Himself governs order; not as is supposed in the universal only, but also in the veriest singulars, for the universal comes from these. To speak of the universal, 
and to separate from it the singulars, would be nothing else than to speak of a whole in which there are no parts, and therefore to speak of a something in which there is nothing. So that to say that 
the Lord's Providence is universal, and is not a Providence of the veriest singulars, is to say what is utterly false, and is what is called an ens rationis [that is, a figment of the imagination]. For 
to provide and govern in the universal, and not in the veriest singulars, is to provide and govern absolutely nothing. This is true philosophically, and yet wonderful to say, philosophers themselves, 
even those who soar the highest, apprehend the matter differently, and think differently. </p>

That 'Abram said to Sarai' means perception is clear from what has been stated above in <a href="1898.htm">1898</a>. The perception which the Lord had was represented and is here meant by 'Abram said to Sarai', but thought 
which sprang from that perception is meant by 'Sarai said to Abram' - perception being the source of thought. The thought possessed by those who have perception comes from no other source. Yet perception 
is not the same as thought. To see that it is not the same, let conscience serve to 'illustrate this consideration. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Conscience is a kind of general and thus obscure dictate which presents 
those things that flow in from the Lord by way of the heavens. Those things that flow in manifest themselves in the interior rational man where they are enveloped so to speak in cloud. This cloud is the 
product of appearances and illusions concerning the goods and truths of faith. Thought is, in truth, distinct and separate from conscience; yet it flows from conscience, for people who have conscience 
think and speak according to it. Indeed thought is scarcely anything more than a loosening of the various strands that make up conscience, and a converting of these into separate ideas which pass 
into words. Hence it is that the Lord holds those who have conscience in good thoughts regarding the neighbour and withholds them from evil thoughts. For this reason conscience can never exist except 
with people who love the neighbour as themselves and have good thoughts regarding the truths of faith. These considerations brought forward here show how conscience differs from thought, and from this 
one may recognize how perception differs from thought. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The Lord's perception came directly from Jehovah, and so from Divine Good, whereas His thought came from intellectual truth and the affection 
for it, as stated above in <a href="1904.htm">1904</a>,<a href="1914.htm">1914</a>. No idea, not even an angelic one, is adequate as a means to apprehend the Lord's Divine perception, and thus this lies beyond description. The perception which 
angels have - described in <a href="1384.htm">1384</a> and following paragraphs, <a href="1394.htm">1394</a>, <a href="1395.htm">1395</a> - adds up to scarcely anything at all when contrasted with the perception that was the Lord's. Because the Lord's perception was 
Divine, it was a perception of everything in heaven; and being a perception of everything in heaven it was also a perception of everything on earth. For such is the order, interconnection, and influx 
that anyone who has a perception of heavenly things has a perception of earthly as well. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 But after the Lord's Human Essence had become united to His Divine Essence, and had become at the same 
time Jehovah, the Lord was then above what is called perception, for He was above the order which exists in the heavens and from there upon earth. It is Jehovah who is the source of order, and therefore 
one may say that Jehovah is Order itself, for from Himself He governs order, not merely, as is supposed, in the universal but also in its most specific singulars, for it is these singulars that make 
up the universal. To speak of the universal and then separate such singulars from it would be no different from speaking of a whole that has no parts within it and so no different from speaking of something 
consisting of nothing. Thus it is sheer falsity - a figment of the imagination, as it is called - to speak of the Lord's Providence as belonging to the universal but not to its specific singulars; 
for to provide and govern universally but not specifically is to provide and govern absolutely nothing. This is true philosophically, yet, strange to say, philosophers themselves, including the 
more eminent, understand this matter in a different way and think in a different way. </p>

`Dixit Abram ad Sarai': quod significet perceptionem, constat ab illis quae supra n. 1898 dicta sunt: perceptio Domini repraesentata fuit et hic significatur per id quod Abram dixit ad Sarai, sed cogitatio 
ex perceptione per id quod Sarai dixit ad Abram; perceptio erat ex qua cogitatio; qui in perceptione sunt, non aliunde cogitant; sed usque perceptio est aliud quam cogitatio; ut sciatur quod aliud, 
sit ad illustrationem conscientia; [2] conscientia est quoddam dictamen commune ita obscurum illorum quae influunt per caelos a Domino; quae influunt, sistunt se in interiore rationali homine et 
ibi sicut in nube, quae nubes est ex apparentiis et fallaciis de veris et bonis fidei; cogitatio vero distincta est a conscientia, sed fluit a conscientia, nam qui conscientiam habent, secundum illam 
cogitant et loquuntur, estque cogitatio vix aliud quam explicatio illorum quae sunt conscientiae, et sic illorum partitio in ideas et dein in voces; inde est quod qui conscientiam habent, teneantur a 
Domino ut cogitent bene de proximo, atque detineantur a cogitando male; quare conscientia nusquam dabilis est nisi apud illos qui amant proximum sicut semet  et bene cogitant de veris fidei: ex allatis 
constare potest quae differentia est conscientiae et cogitationis, unde sciri potest quae differentia perceptionis et cogitationis.  [3] Perceptio Domini fuit immediate ex Jehovah, ita ex Divino Bono, 
cogitatio autem ex vero intellectuali et ejus affectione, ut supra n. 1904, 1914 dictum. Perceptio Divina Domini non aliqua idea, ne quidem angelica, capi potest, ita nec describi; perceptio angelorum, 
de qua n. 1384 seq. 1394, 1395, vix aliquid est, respective ad perceptionem quae fuit Domino; perceptio Domini quia Divina, fuit omnium quae in caelis, et quia omnium quae in caelis, fuit omnium 
quae in terris, ordo enim est talis, nexus et influxus, ut qui in illorum perceptione est, etiam in horum sit:  [4] at postquam Humana Domini Essentia unita facta Divinae Ipsius, et simul Jehovah, tunc 
Dominus supra illud quod perceptio dicitur, fuit, quia supra ordinem qui in caelis, et inde in terris; est Jehovah, a Quo ordo, inde dici potest quod Jehovah sit Ipse Ordo, a Se Ipso enim regit ordinem, 
non ut putatur, solum in universali, sed (x)etiam in singularissimis; singularissima enim sunt ex quibus universale, dicere universale et inde separare singularia, foret non aliud ac dicere totum 
in quo nullae partes, sic dicere aliquid in quo nihil; ita falsissimum et, sicut vocatur, ens rationis est, dicere quod Providentia Domini sit universalis et non singularissimorum, nam providere et 
regere {1}in universali et non in singularissimis, est prorsus nihil providere et regere: hoc {2}philosophice verum est, sed usque mirum quod ipsi philosophi etiam sublimiores aliter capiant et aliter 
cogitent. @1 universale et non singularissima.$ @2 pure philosophicum est, et philosophice verum.$ </p>
