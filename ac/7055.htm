<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7055节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7055.</strong>“往旷野去”表在此之前没有这种事物，也就是没有这种结合存在的地方。这从“旷野”的含义清楚可知，“旷野”是指至今几乎没有生命的地方（参看<a href="1927.htm">1927</a>节），因而是指没有良善和由此而来的真理的地方（<a href="4736.htm">4736</a>节），因为这些就是那带来生命；但此处的意思是没有直接从神性发出的真理与间接发出的真理的结合之地。“亚伦往旷野去迎接摩西”表示结合要在那里实现。至于这种结合，要知道，间接从神性发出的真理可能存在于一个人身上，然而却尚未与直接从神性发出的真理结合。<br />不过，由于这个问题是一个奥秘，非常模糊，故有必要举例说明。例如，有些人照着他们为自己所确证的教会教义进行思考和教导，却只基于以下事实知道它们是不是真理：它们形成教会教义的一部分，它们是由博学、着作的人士提出的。间接从神性发出的真理有可能存在于这些人身上；但它仍未与直接从神性发出的真理结合。因为如果它真的被如此结合，他们就会拥有为了真理，尤其为了生活而对认识真理的情感。他们还会因此被赋予一种觉知，即在他们为自己确证之前，觉知其教会的教义事物是不是真理；会看到确证每一件事的证据是否与真理本身一致。<br />再以先知为例，圣言是通过他们来写的。他们完全照着来自神性的灵所口述的来写，因为他们所要写的实际的话是在他们耳内说出来的。与他们同在的真理是间接从神性，也就是通过天堂发出的那种；因此，它不是直接从神性发出的真理；因为他们对所听到的一切细节在内义上表示什么没有觉知。事实上，只有当这两种真理结合时，这种觉知才会存在，如前所述。这两种真理很少在一个世人身上结合，但它们在天堂里的所有人身上结合，尤其在那些在至内层或第三层天堂里的人身上结合。它们不会在一个世人身上结合，除非这个人已经重生到这种程度，他能从感官层被提升向其心智的理性层，从而被置于天使所在的天堂之光。对每个人来说，来自神的流注的确既直接也间接而来（参看<a href="6063.htm">6063</a>，<a href="7004.htm">7004</a>节）；但这二者的结合只发生在那些对源于良善的真理有觉知的人身上。因为那些直接神性流注与间接神性流注已在他们身上结合的人允许自己被主引导；但那些这两种流注没有他们身上结合的人则引导自己，并喜欢引导自己。由此可见“旷野”在此表示什么，即表示没有结合的地方。</p>

Into the wilderness. That this signifies where previously it is not so, namely, conjunction, is evident from the signification of "wilderness," as being where as yet there is little vitality (see n. 
1927), thus where there is no good and the derivative truth (n. 4736), for thence is vitality; here, where there is no conjunction of the truth proceeding immediately from the Divine with the truth proceeding 
immediately. That conjunction was to be effected there, is signified by "Aaron went to meet Moses in the wilderness." As to this conjunction, be it known that there may be with a man truth proceeding 
mediately from the Divine, and yet it may not be conjoined with the truth which proceeds immediately from the Divine. [2] But as this matter is secret, it shall be illustrated by examples. With 
those who think and teach according to the doctrine of their church confirmed in themselves, and do not know whether they are truths from any other ground than the fact that they are from the doctrine 
of the church, and that they have been delivered by learned and enlightened men, there can be truth proceeding mediately from the Divine; but still it is not conjoined with the truth that proceeds 
immediately from the Divine; for if it were conjoined, they would then have the affection of knowing truth for the sake of truth, and especially for the sake of life, whence they would also be endowed 
with a perception whether the doctrinal things of their church are truths before they confirm them in themselves; and would see in each whether the things confirming are in agreement with the truth 
itself. [3] Take as another example the prophets, through whom the Word was written. They wrote as the spirit from the Divine dictated, for the very words which they wrote were uttered in their ears. 
With them there was truth proceeding mediately from the Divine, that is, through heaven, but not for this reason the truth which proceeded immediately from the Divine; because they had no perception 
of what all the details signified in the internal sense. For when these two kinds of truth have been conjoined, then, as already said, there is perception. Such conjunction rarely exists with man, but 
it does so with all who are in heaven, especially with those who are in the inmost or third heaven; nor does it exist with a man unless he has been so far regenerated as to be capable of being elevated 
from the sensuous even toward his rational, and thus of being set in the light of heaven, where angels are. There is indeed with every man Divine influx both immediate and mediate (see n. 6063, 7004), 
but not conjunction, except with those who have perception of truth from good; for they with whom immediate Divine influx has been conjoined with mediate suffer themselves to be led by the Lord; 
but they with whom these influxes have not been conjoined, lead themselves, and this they love. From all this it can now be seen what is here meant by the "wilderness"-that it denotes where there is no 
conjunction. </p>

'To the wilderness' means a situation prior to that in which no such thing - no such joining together - exists. This is clear from the meaning of 'the wilderness' as a situation in which there is as 
yet little of life, dealt with in <a href="1927.htm">1927</a>, thus where there is no good and consequently no truth, <a href="4736.htm">4736</a>, for these are what bring things to life. But the meaning here is a situation in which truth going forth 
directly from the Divine is not joined together with truth that goes forth in an indirect way. The fact that that was where a joining together was to be effected is meant by Aaron's going to meet 
Moses, to the wilderness. As regards that joining together, it should be recognized that truth which goes forth from the Divine in an indirect way may exist with a person, and yet not be joined to truth 
going forth directly from the Divine.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But since this matter is very obscure let some examples be used to shed light on it. Take people who think and teach in accordance with the teachings 
of their Church which they have corroborated for themselves, but who do not know whether they are true on any grounds other than the fact that they form part of what the Church teaches and that they have 
been propounded by learned and famous men. Truth that goes forth from the Divine in an indirect way may exist with those people, yet for all that it is not joined to truth going forth directly from 
the Divine. For if it were so joined they would have an affection for knowing truth for its own sake and especially for the sake of the life they should lead. They would also as a consequence be endowed 
with a perception of whether matters taught by their Church were true before corroborating them for themselves, and would see whether the evidence corroborating each of those matters agreed with 
the truth itself.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Take as another example the prophets through whom the Word was written. They wrote exactly as the spirit from the Divine dictated, for the actual words which they were to write 
were uttered in their ears. Truth with them was the kind that goes forth in an indirect way from the Divine, that is, through heaven; it was not therefore truth going forth directly from the Divine. 
For they had no perception of what the particular things they heard might mean in the internal sense because it is only when those two kinds of truth have been joined together that perception exists, 
as has been stated. The two kinds are rarely joined together with a person in this world, but they are so with all in heaven, above all with those in the inmost or third heaven. Nor are they joined 
together with a person in this world unless his regeneration has advanced so far that he can be raised from the level of the senses right up to the rational level of his mind and so be placed in the light 
of heaven where the angels are. With everyone influx from God does indeed come by both a direct and an indirect way, <a href="6063.htm">6063</a>, <a href="7004.htm">7004</a>; but no joining together of the two takes place except with those who 
have a perception of truth derived from good. For those with whom influx coming directly from God has been joined to that which comes indirectly allow themselves to be led by the Lord; but those with 
whom the two have not been joined together lead themselves and like to do so. From all this one may now see what 'the wilderness' is used to mean here, namely a situation in which no joining together exists.  </p>

`Desertum': quod significet ubi non ita prius est, nempe conjunctio, constat a significatione `deserti' quod sit ubi parum vitale adhuc, de qua n. 1927, ita ubi non bonum et inde verum, n. 4736, nam 
inde est vitale; hic ubi non conjunctio veri immediate a Divino procedentis cum vero mediate procedente; quod ibi conjunctio fieret, significatur per quod `Aharon vaderet obviam Moschi desertum.'  Quod 
conjunctionem illam concernit, sciendum quod apud hominem verum mediate a Divino procedens dari possit, et tamen usque id non esse conjunctum cum vero quod immediate a Divino procedit. 	2 Sed haec 
res quia {1} (t)arcana est, illustretur exemplis: qui secundum doctrinam suae Ecclesiae apud se confirmatam cogitant {2}et docent, et non sciunt num vera sint aliunde quam ex eo quod ex (x)doctrina Ecclesiae 
sint, et quod a viris {3}doctis et illustratis tradita, apud illos verum mediate a Divino procedens potest esse, sed usque hoc non conjunctum est cum vero quod immediate a Divino procedit; si 
enim conjunctum foret, tunc haberent {4}affectionem sciendi verum propter verum, et imprimis propter vitam, inde quoque donati forent perceptione num doctrinalia Ecclesiae suae sunt vera antequam confirmant 
illa apud se, et viderent in singulis num concordarent confirmantia cum ipso vero. 	3 Sint etiam pro exemplo: prophetae per quos Verbum scriptum est, illi scripserunt sicut spiritus a Divino 
{5}dictavit, ipsa enim verba quae scriberent in auribus illorum enuntiabantur; apud illos fuit verum mediate a Divino procedens, hoc est, per caelum, sed non ideo verum quod immediate a Divino processit, 
nam non perceptionem habebant, quid singula in sensu interno significarent, nam cum conjuncta sunt, tunc, ut dictum, perceptio datur. Conjunctio illa raro datur apud hominem, sed datur apud omnes 
qui in caelo, cumprimis qui in caelo intimo seu tertio sunt; nec apud hominem datur nisi ille in tantum regeneratus sit ut elevari queat a sensuali usque versus rationale suum, et sic in luce caeli ubi 
sunt angeli sisti.  Apud omnem quidem hominem est influxus Divinus tam immediatus quam mediatus, n. 6063, 7004, sed conjunctio non est nisi apud illos qui perceptionem veri ex bono habent; nam {6}illi 
apud quos conjunctus est influxus immediatus Divinus cum mediato {7}se patiuntur a Domino duci, sed apud {8}quos non conjuncti sunt {9}influxus illi semetipsos ducunt; et hoc amant.  Ex his nunc constare 
potest quid per `desertum' hic intelligitur, quod sit ubi non conjunctio. 	@1 i in se$ 	@2 aut$ 	@3 illustratis et doctis$ 	@4 perceptionem num doctrinalia sunt vera, antequam confirmantur$ 	@5 
dictarunt$ 	@6 ille apud quem$ 	@7 ducitur a Domino$ 	@8 quem$ 	@9 ducitur a semet$ </p>
