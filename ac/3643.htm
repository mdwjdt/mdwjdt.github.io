<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3643节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3643.</strong>我发现，天上的人住在像早晨和中午，以及接近傍晚那样的晴朗、明亮的天空下；同样住在像春、夏、秋那样的热中。而地狱里的人则住在幽暗、阴云密布和漆黑的天空下，也住在冬天的寒冷中。我注意到，这二者之间总体上保持平衡；而且，天使照着所具有的爱和仁、因而信的程度而住在晴朗的天空下和温暖的春天里；地狱灵则照着所具有的仇恨、因而虚假的程度而住在幽暗和寒冷中。如前所述，在来世，光含有聪明在里面，热含有爱在里面，幽暗含有疯狂在里面，寒冷含有仇恨在里面。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3643</b></p><p><b>3643.</b>
It was observed that they who are in the heavens are in a serene aura of light, like the light of morning and of noon, also verging to evening; and in like manner that they are in heat as of spring, 
of summer, and of autumn; whereas they who are in hell are in an atmosphere gross, cloudy, and dark, and are also in cold. It was observed that between these in general there is an equilibrium; also that 
in proportion as the angels are in love, charity, and the derivative faith, in the same proportion they are in an aura of light and of vernal heat; and in proportion as the infernals are in hatred, 
and thence in falsity, in the same proportion they are in thick darkness and in cold. As before said in the other life the light has intelligence within it, the heat has within it love, the thick darkness 
insanity, and the cold hatred. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3643</b></p><p><b>3643.</b>
I have noticed that those in heaven dwell beneath a clear, bright sky like that of morning and midday, extending also towards evening, and likewise in a warmth like that of spring, summer, and autumn. 
But those in hell dwell under a dim, cloudy, and darkened sky, and also in the cold [of winter]. I have noticed that between the two in general a balance is kept; also that insofar as love, charity, 
and consequently faith are present in angels, they dwell under a clear sky and in the warmth of spring, and that insofar as hatred and consequently falsity are present in those in hell they dwell in 
thick darkness and in coldness. And as stated above, the light in the next life holds intelligence within it, the warmth love within it, while thick darkness holds insanity within it, and cold hatred 
within it. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 3643</b>
</p><b>3643.</b>
Observatum quod qui in caelis, in aura lucis serena sint sicut lucis matutinae et meridianae, etiam vergentis ad vesperam, similiter quod in calore sint sicut veris, aestatis et autumni; at quod illi 
qui in inferno sunt, in atmosphaera crassa, nimbosa et tenebrosa, ut et in frigore: observatum quod inter illa in communi sit aequilibrium; tum quantum angeli in amore, charitate et inde fide sunt, tantum 
in aura lucis et caloris vernalis; et infernales, quantum in odio et inde in falso, tantum in caligine et in frigore; lux in altera vita, ut supra dictum, in se habet intelligentiam, calor amorem, 
caligo insaniam et frigus odium. </p>
