<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3049节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3049.</strong>“他主人的各样财物都在他手里”表属世人所具有的这些知识的良善与真理。这从“他主人的各样财物”和“手”的含义清楚可知。“他主人的各样财物”是指良善与真理，真理本身是良善，因为它源于良善；真理是良善所取的形式，也就是说，当良善接受一个形式，以便它能在理解力中被觉察到时，它就被称作真理。“手”是指能力（参看<a href="878.htm">878</a>节），故“在他手里”在此表示属世人所具有的良善与真理。一般记忆知识本身并非良善，它们也没有任何生命。但对它们的情感使它们成为良善、拥有生命，因为当有这种情感时，它们就为了用而存在。若非为了某种功用，没有哪个人的情感会被任何记忆知识或真理唤起。这种功用使它成为良善，并且功用的具体性质决定了良善的性质。</p>

And every good of his lord was in his hand. That this signifies the goods and truths of these knowledges with the natural man, is evident from the signification of "every good of his lord," as being 
both good and truth; for in itself truth is good, because from good; and truth is the form of good, that is to say, when good is formed so as to be perceived intellectually, it is then called truth: and 
also from the signification of "hand," as being power (see n. 878); "in his hand" therefore meaning that which he had. In themselves general memory-knowledges are not goods, nor are they alive; it 
is the affection of them that causes them to be goods, and to be alive; for when there is this affection they are for the sake of use; since no one is affected by any memory-knowledge or truth except 
for some use; use makes it a good; and such as the use is, such is the good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3049</b></p><p><b>3049.</b>
'And every good thing that was his master's was in his hand' means the goods and truths associated with those facts residing with the natural man. This is clear from the meaning of 'every good thing 
that was his master's' as both good and truth, for in itself truth is good since it springs from good - truth being the form that good takes, that is, when good receives a form so that it can be perceived 
in the understanding it is called truth; and from the meaning of 'the hand' as power, dealt with in <a href="878.htm">878</a>. Thus the goods and truths residing with the natural man are meant here. General facts are 
not in themselves good, nor do they have any life; but the affection for them is what causes them to be good and to have life, for in that case they exist for the sake of their use. No one's affection 
is stirred by any fact or truth, except on account of the use it serves. The use is what makes it good, though the particular nature of the use determines the nature of the good. </p>

`Et omne bonum Domini in manu sua': quod significet illorum bona et vera apud illum, constat a significatione `omnis' boni Domini' quod sit et bonum et verum, nam verum in se est bonum quia a bono; 
est verum forma boni, hoc est, cum bonum formatur ut intellectualiter percipiatur, tunc id vocatur verum; ex significatione `manus' quod sit potentia, de qua n. 878, ita quae apud illum: communia scientifica 
non sunt bona in se, nec viva, sed affectio eorum {1}facit ut bona sint et vivant, tunc enim sunt propter usum; nemo afficitur aliquo scientifico seu vero nisi ob usum; usus facit illud bonum; 
at qualis usus tale bonum. @1 i est quod$  </p>
