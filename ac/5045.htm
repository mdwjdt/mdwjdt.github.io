<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5045节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5045.</strong>“就把牢里所有的囚犯都交在约瑟的手下”表掌管一切虚假（的真理）是从祂自己获得的，也就是说，在试探状态下进行掌管的真理是从祂自己获得的。这从“交在约瑟的手下”和“牢里的囚犯”的含义清楚可知：“交在约瑟的手下”是指置于它的权柄和掌控之下，“手”表示权柄和掌控（参看<a href="5008.htm">5008</a>节），因而意思是，从祂自己获得之物，因为凡凭祂的能力所行的，都是凭祂自己所成就的某种事，而“约瑟”在内义上表示主，如前面频繁所示；“牢里的囚犯”是指虚假，如前所示（<a href="5037.htm">5037</a>，<a href="5038.htm">5038</a>节）。“监狱长就把牢里所有的囚犯都交在约瑟的手下”表示在试探状态下，从祂自己获得并有权柄管理一切虚假的进行掌管的真理；也就是说，祂在试探状态下掌管虚假所凭的真理源于祂自己。就内义而言，此处和本章末尾论述的主题是主，祂在试探的状态下如何凭自己的能力掌管，也就是战胜众地狱；这些地狱深陷邪恶与虚假，并不断向人类倾倒它们。主凭自己的能力战胜并征服地狱，从而荣耀祂里面的人身，或使这人身变成神性（参看<a href="1616.htm">1616</a>，<a href="1749.htm">1749</a>，<a href="1755.htm">1755</a>，<a href="1813.htm">1813</a>，<a href="1904.htm">1904</a>，<a href="1914.htm">1914</a>，<a href="1921.htm">1921</a>，<a href="1935.htm">1935</a>，<a href="2025.htm">2025</a>，<a href="2026.htm">2026</a>，<a href="2083.htm">2083</a>，<a href="2159.htm">2159</a>，<a href="2574.htm">2574</a>，<a href="2786.htm">2786</a>，<a href="2795.htm">2795</a>，<a href="3036.htm">3036</a>，<a href="3381.htm">3381</a>，<a href="3382.htm">3382</a>，<a href="4075.htm">4075</a>，<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>，<a href="5005.htm">5005</a>节）。这从圣言中的许多经文明显看出来，如从约翰福音中的这段经文：<br />因我将灵魂舍去，好再取回来。没有人从我那里夺去它，是我自己舍的。我有权柄舍了，也有权柄取回来。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.17.htm">10:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.18.htm">18</a>）<br />十字架受难是终极试探，主凭该试探完全荣耀了祂里面的人身，也就是使它变成神性，这一点也可从圣言中的许多经文（如约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.31.htm">13:31</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.32.htm">32</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.1.htm">17:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.5.htm">5</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.26.htm">24:26</a>）明显看出来。</p>

Gave into Joseph's hand all the bound ones that were in the prison house. That this signifies from Himself over all falsities, namely, truth governing in a state of temptations, is evident from the signification 
of "giving into Joseph's hand," as being into his power, the "hand" being power (see n. 5008); thus meaning that it was from Himself, for what is effected from His power is effected from 
Himself-by "Joseph" being meant in the internal sense the Lord, as often shown above; and from the signification of the "bound ones in the prison house," as being falsities (as shown above, n. 5037, 5038). 
Thus by "the prince of the prison gave into Joseph's hand all the bound ones that were in the prison house," is signified truth governing in a state of temptations from Himself over all falsities; 
that is, that the truth by which He governed falsities in a state of temptations was from Himself. Here, and in what follows to the end of this chapter, in the internal sense the subject treated of 
is the Lord, how He from His own power governed in a state of temptations, that is, overcame the hells, which were in evils and falsities and were continually pouring them into mankind. That the Lord 
by His own power overcame and subdued the hells, and thus glorified or made Divine the Human in Himself, may be seen above (n. 1616, 1749, 1755, 1813, 1904, 1914, 1921, 1935, 2025, 2026, 2083, 2159, 
2574, 2786, 2795, 3036, 3381, 3382, 4075, 4286, 5005). This is evident from many passages in the Word, as from this in John: </p>
<p>	I lay down My soul, that I may take it again. No man taketh it from Me, but 
I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again (John 10:17-18). That the passion of the cross was the last of the temptations, and that by it the Lord fully 
glorified the Human in Himself, that is, made it Divine, is also plain from many passages in the Word, as in John 13:31, 32; 17:1, 5; Luke 24:26. </p>

'Into Joseph's hand all the bound who were in the prison-house' means received from Him over all falsities, that is to say, the truth governing in a state of temptations was received from Him. This is 
clear from the meaning of 'giving into Joseph's hand' as placing under its power and control ('the hand' means power and control, <a href="5008.htm">5008</a>, thus that which is received from Him - for anything done by the 
use of His power is something done by Him - while 'Joseph' means the Lord in the internal sense, as has often been shown above); and from the meaning of 'the bound in the prison-house' as falsities, 
dealt with above in <a href="5037.htm">5037</a>, <a href="5038.htm">5038</a>. Thus 'the governor of the prison-house gave into Joseph's hand all the bound who were in the prison-house' means the truth governing in the state of temptations that was 
received from Him and had power over all falsities, that is, He Himself was the source of the truth by means of which He governed falsities in the state of temptations. Here and in what follows at 
the end of this present chapter the subject in the internal sense is the Lord and the government executed by Him in a state of temptations. That is, it describes how He overcame, by His own power, the 
hells which were steeped in evils and falsities, and which were constantly pouring out evils and falsities onto the human race. For details about the Lord overcoming them and bringing them into subjection 
to Himself by His own power, thereby also glorifying the Human within Him or making it Divine, see <a href="1616.htm">1616</a>, <a href="1749.htm">1749</a>, <a href="1755.htm">1755</a>, <a href="1813.htm">1813</a>, <a href="1904.htm">1904</a>, <a href="1914.htm">1914</a>, <a href="1921.htm">1921</a>, <a href="1935.htm">1935</a>, <a href="2025.htm">2025</a>, <a href="2026.htm">2026</a>, <a href="2083.htm">2083</a>, <a href="2159.htm">2159</a>, <a href="2574.htm">2574</a>, <a href="2786.htm">2786</a>, <a href="2795.htm">2795</a>, <a href="3036.htm">3036</a>, <a href="3381.htm">3381</a>, <a href="4075.htm">4075</a>, <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>, <a href="5005.htm">5005</a>. This is clear from many places in the Word, including the following in John, </p>
<blockquote>
I lay down My life,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> so that I may receive it again. No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down 
of Myself; I have power to lay it down and I have power to receive it again. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2010:17,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 10:17, 18</a>.

<blockquote>
The passion of the Cross was the last temptation, by which He fully glorified the Human within Him, that 
is, made it Divine, as is also evident from many places in the Word, such as <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2013:31,%2032;%2017:1,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 13:31, 32; 17:1, 5</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2024:26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 24:26</a>.

`In manum Josephi omnes vinctos qui in domo carceris': quod significet ab Ipso super omnia falsa, nempe verum gubernans in statu tentationum, constat a significatione `dare in manum Josephi' quod 
sit in ejus potestatem, `manus' enim est potestas, (o)n. 5008, ita quod ab Ipso [sit]; ab Ipso enim fit quod ab Ipsius potestate; </p>
<p>per `Josephum' in sensu interno intelligitur Dominus, ut supra saepius 
ostensum; et a significatione `vinctorum in domo carceris' quod sint falsa, de qua supra n. 5037, 5038; ita per `dedit princeps domus carceris in manum Josephi omnes vinctos qui in domo carceris' 
significatur verum gubernans in statu tentationum ab Ipso super omnia falsa, hoc est, quod ab Ipso verum per quod gubernavit falsa in statu tentationum.  Hic et in sequentibus ad finem hujus capitis 
in sensu interno agitur de Domino quod Ipse ex propria potentia in statu tentationum gubernaverit, hoc est, vicerit inferna quae in malis et falsis fuerunt {1}, quae continue mala et falsa humano 
generi infuderunt {2}; quod Dominus propria potentia illa vicerit et subjugaverit, et sic Humanum in Se glorificaverit seu Divinum fecerit, videatur n. 1616, 1749, 1755, 1813, 1904, 1914, 1921, 
1935, 2025, 2026, 2083, 2159, 2574, 2786, 2795, 3036, {3} 3382, 4075, 4286, 5005; hoc {4} a pluribus locis in Verbo constat, ut quoque ab hoc apud Johannem, </p>
<p>          Ego pono animam Meam, ut rursus 
accipiam eam; nemo      tollit eam a Me, sed Ego pono a Me Ipso; potestatem Ego      habeo ponendi eam, et potestatem habeo rursus accipiendi      eam, x 17, 18; </p>
<p> quod passio crucis fuerit 
ultimum tentationum, per quod Humanum in Se plene glorificavit, hoc est, Divinum facit, patet quoque a pluribus locis in Verbo, ut quoque apud Joh. xiii 31, 32; xvii 1, 5; Luc. xxiv 26. </p>
