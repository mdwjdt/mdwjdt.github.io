<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5713节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5713.</strong>凡在地狱里的人都是诱发疾病的原因，尽管各不相同。因为所有地狱都沉浸在对邪恶的欲望和贪求中，因而与天堂的事物对立；因此，它们对人施加反面影响。天堂，即大人，维持一切事物的相互联系，使它们免受伤害；而地狱因处在对立面，故摧毁并割断一切事物，使它们彼此矛盾。正因如此，地狱里的人若与世人接触，就会带来疾病，最终带来死亡。然而，他们不允许流入人体的实体部位，也不允许流入构成人的内脏，或其它器官和肢体的部位；只流入他的恶欲和虚假观念。只有当他患病时，他们才流入诸如属于疾病的那类不洁之物。因为如前所述，若没有灵界的一个原因，没有什么东西能在人里面产生。人的属世部分若脱离属灵部分，就会与整个原因（它从这原因拥有其存在）分离，因而与带给它生命的一切分离。然而，这并不妨碍人以属世的方式得医治。因为主的旨意赞同这类方法。我通过大量经历得知这一事实，并且这类经历如此之多，时间如此之长，以致我根本没有怀疑的余地。来自这些地方的恶灵曾经常且长时间地与我接触，他们照其出现而引发疼痛，也引发疾病。我被指示这些灵人在哪里，是什么样，还被告知他们来自哪里。</p>

All the infernals induce diseases, but with a difference, for the reason that all the hells are in the desires and lusts of evil, and thus are contrary to the things of heaven; wherefore they act upon 
man from what is opposite. Heaven, which is the Grand Man, holds all things together in connection and safety; hell, being in what is opposite, destroys and severs all things. Consequently if the infernals 
are applied they induce diseases and at last death. Yet they are not permitted to flow as far as into the solid parts of the body, or into the parts of which man's viscera, organs, and members 
consist, but merely into his cupidities and falsities. It is only when the man falls into disease that they flow into such unclean things as belong to the disease; for as before said nothing ever takes 
place in man without a cause in the spiritual world. If the natural with man were separated from the spiritual, it would be separated from all cause of existence, and thus from all that is vital. Yet 
this does not hinder man's being healed in a natural way; for the Lord's providence concurs with such means. That this is so has been given me to know by much experience, and this so often and for 
so long that no doubt was left; for evil spirits from such places have been applied to me often and long, and according to their presence they induced pains, and also diseases. I was shown where they 
were, and what they were, and was told also where they came from. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5713</b></p><p><b>5713.</b>
All who are in hell are the causers of sicknesses, though varying ones, for the reason that all the hells are steeped in desires and cravings for what is evil. That being so, they are antagonistic to 
the things of heaven, and for this reason they exert an opposite influence on man. Heaven, which is the Grand Man, preserves the interconnection of all things and keeps them safe from harm; hell, having 
opposite intentions, is destructive of all things and sets them at variance with one another. This being so, if those in hell are brought into contact with man they bring sicknesses and at length 
death. But they are not allowed to enter the actual solid parts of a person's body, nor the parts making up his internal organs or his other organs and limbs; they do not enter anything else than his 
evil desires and false ideas. Only when he falls sick do they enter any further, into the kinds of uncleanness that are the essence of sicknesses. For as has been stated, nothing ever comes into being 
with man unless a cause also exists in the spiritual world. If the natural part of a person's being were separated from the spiritual part it would be separated from the entire cause from which it has 
its being and so from all that brings it life. Even so, this does not make it impossible for a person to be healed by natural remedies, for the Lord's providence works in co-operation with means such 
as these. I have been enabled through much experience to know the truth of this, on so many occasions and during such lengthy periods that I have not been left in any doubt at all. For evil spirits 
from such places have been brought in contact with me often and for lengthy periods; and according to their presence they introduced feelings of pain and also sicknesses. I was shown where those spirits 
were and what they were like, and I was also told where they came from. </p>

</p><b>5713.</b>
Omnes infernales inducunt morbos sed cum differentia, ex causa quia omnia inferna in cupiditatibus et concupiscentiis mali sunt, proinde contra illa quae sunt caeli, quare agunt ex opposito in hominem; 
caelum quod est Maximus Homo, continet omnia in nexu et incolumitate; {1}infernum quia in opposito est, destruit et discindit omnia; proinde si infernales applicantur, inducunt morbos et tandem mortem; 
at non permittitur illis influere usque in ipsas partes solidas corporis, seu in partes ex quibus consistunt viscera, organa, et membra hominis, sed modo in cupiditates et falsitates; solum cum 
homo in morbum cadit, tunc influunt in talia immunda quae sunt morbi; nam, ut dictum, nihil usquam existit apud hominem nisi causa etiam sit {2}in mundo spirituali; naturale apud hominem, si separatum 
esset a spirituali, separatum esset ab omni causa existentiae, ita quoque ab omni vitali.  Sed hoc usque non impedit {3}quin homo possit naturaliter sanari, concurrit enim cum talibus mediis providentia 
Domini.  Quod ita se res habeat, per multam experientiam scire datum est, et hoc toties et tamdiu ut non aliquid dubii relictum sit; spiritus mali enim e talibus locis mihi saepe et diu applicati 
sunt, et secundum praesentia induxerunt dolores et quoque morbos, ostensi mihi ubinam essent et quales essent, et dictum quoque undenam essent. @1 infernales with plural verbs.$ @2 A d in, i e$ @3 quia I$ </p>
