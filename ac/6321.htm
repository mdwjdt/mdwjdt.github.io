<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6321节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6321.</strong>我通过经历得以知道天使流注的存在，没有它，人就无法存活。有些恶毒的灵人设计阻止天使的流注，但只是在某种程度上。他们也被允许向我做这种事，好叫我通过经历知道事情是怎么回事。随着他们阻止这流注，我的思维能力或说思维的生命起伏不定，直到最后我觉得自己就像陷入昏迷的人。不过，我立刻就苏醒了，于是那些灵人被投入他们自己的地狱。他们出现在我头顶那个层面的左侧，在那里一开始是隐藏的，看不见。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6321</b></p><p><b>6321.</b>
That there is angelic influx, and that without it man cannot live, has been given to know by experience. There are malignant spirits who have devised arts for hindering the angelic influx, but only in 
part. With me also they were permitted to do this, to the end that I might know from experience that the case is so. In proportion as they hindered the influx, the life of the thought fluctuated, and 
at last was the same as it is with those who are falling into a swoon. But I was instantly restored, and those spirits were cast down into their hell. They appeared to the left, in the plane of the 
crown of the head, where at first they were in concealment. </p>

I have been led to know, through experience, of the influx from angels and of a person's inability to live without it. There are malevolent spirits who have worked out artful ways of impeding an influx 
from the angels, though they do so only partially. They have been allowed to do it to me also so that I might know from experience what it was like. While those spirits were impeding the influx my 
ability to think ebbed and flowed, till at length I felt like those sinking into unconsciousness. But I was revived in an instant, and those spirits were cast away into their own hell. They appeared on 
the left on a level with the top of my head, where at first they lay out of sight. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 6321</b>
</p><b>6321.</b>
Quod influxus angelicus sit, et quod absque illo homo non possit vivere, datum est scire per experientiam; sunt spiritus maligni qui excogitarunt artes inhibendi influxum angelicum sed modo quoad aliquam 
partem; hoc illis permissum etiam mecum facere ob finem ut ab experientia scirem quod res ita se haberet; qui sicut inhibebant influxum, ita vita cogitationis fluctuabat et tandem erat sicut apud 
illos qui in deliquium cadunt; sed momento restitutus sum; et illi spiritus in infernum suum dejecti sunt: apparebant ad sinistrum in plano verticis capitis, ubi primum erant in occulto. </p>
