Verses 24-26. And Abraham was a son of ninety and nine years when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. And Ishmael his son was a son of thirteen years when he was circumcised in the flesh 
of his foreskin. In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son. "Abraham was a son of ninety and nine years," signifies the state and time before the union of the Lord's Divine Essence 
with His Human Essence; "when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin," signifies when He utterly expelled the evils of the external man; "and Ishmael his son," signifies those who by virtue 
of the truths of faith are made rational by the Lord; "a son of thirteen years," signifies holy remains; "when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin," signifies, as before, purification; 
"in the selfsame day," signifies that it was then; "was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son," signifies that when the Lord conjoined His Human Essence with His Divine Essence, He also conjoined 
with Himself all others who become rational from truth, and saved them. </p>

Verses 24-26 And Abraham was a son of ninety-nine years when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. And Ishmael his son was a son of thirteen years when he was circumcised in the flesh of his 
foreskin. On that very day Abraham was circumcised, and Ishmael his son. </p>
<p>'Abraham was a son of ninety-nine years' means the state and the period of time prior to the union of the Lord's Divine Essence 
with His Human Essence. 'When he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin' means when the evils occupying the External Man were totally driven out. 'And Ishmael his son' means those who become 
rational from truths of faith from the Lord. 'A son of thirteen years' means sacred remnants. 'When he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin' means purification, as previously. 'On that very 
day' means at that very time. 'Abraham was circumcised, and Ishmael his son' means that when the Lord joined His Human Essence to the Divine Essence, He also joined to Himself and saved everyone else 
who becomes rational from truth. </p>

Vers. 24-26.  Et Abraham filius nonaginta et novem annorum, in circumcidendo illo carnem praeputii sui.  Et Jishmael filius illius, filius tredecim annorum, in circumcidendo illi carnem praeputii ejus. 
 In eodem die hoc circumcisus est Abraham, et Jishmael filius ejus. `Abraham filius nonaginta et novem annorum' significat statum et tempus ante unionem Essentiae Divinae Domini cum Ipsius Humana: 
`in circumcidendo illo carnem praeputii sui' significat cum externi hominis mala prorsus expulit: `et Jishmael filius ejus' significat illos qui ex veris fidei a Domino rationales fiunt: `filius tredecim 
annorum' significat reliquias sanctas: `in circumcidendo illi carnem praeputii ejus' significat, ut prius, purificationem: `in eodem die hoc' significat quod tunc: `circumcisus est Abraham, et Jishmael 
filius ejus' significat quod cum Dominus conjunxit Humanam Essentiam Ipsius Divinae, etiam conjunxit Sibi ceteros qui ex vero rationales fiunt, et salvavit. </p>
