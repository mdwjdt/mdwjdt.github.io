<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1649.</strong>奇妙的是，这种具有歌曲节奏或旋律的言语对灵人来说很自然。他们自己之间就是如此说话，尽管他们没有意识到这一点。死后，灵魂会立即习惯这种说话方式。我也开始进入其中，并最终变得驾轻就熟。他们的言语之所以具有这种性质，是因为他们作为一个社群说话，但他们绝大部分对此一无所知。一个非常明显的证据是，他们全都被划分到各个社群，因此，一切事物都具有这些社群的形式。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1649.</strong> Surprisingly, this manner of speech 钬?with a cadence that imitates the rhythm and music of a song 钬?is natural for spirits. It is the way they talk among themselves, even though they are unaware of doing so. Souls take up the habit of speaking this way right after death. I too was introduced to it, and eventually it became familiar to me.<br />The reason spirits talk this way is that they speak in concert as a community, although they usually do not realize they are doing so. This indicates clearly that all spirits are divided into communities, and that all things are therefore divided into something analogous to communities. </p>

Wonderful to say, this kind of speech, possessing the rhythmical or harmonic cadence of songs, is natural to spirits. They speak so among themselves, although they are not aware of it. Immediately after 
death souls come into the habit of speaking in this way. I have been initiated into the same, and it has at last become familiar. The reason their speech is of this nature, is that they speak in society, 
which for the most part they are not aware of: a very clear proof that they are all distinguished into societies, and that consequently all things fall into the forms of the societies. </p>

What is remarkable, speech with a cadence like the rhythmic or harmonic patterns of songs comes naturally to spirits. They speak to one another in this way, though they are not conscious of doing so. 
Souls enter into that style of speaking immediately after death. I too have been initiated into the same till at length it has become quite familiar. The reason it is of this nature is that they speak 
as a community, though for the most part they are not conscious of doing so - a very clear sign that all are distinguished into separate communities and that consequently everything takes on the forms 
of those communities. </p>

</p><b>1649.</b>
Quod mirum, locutio labens sicut rhythmica seu harmonica canticorum, est naturalis spirituum; loquuntur ita inter se, tametsi id nesciunt; in ipsum habitum sic loquendi veniunt animae statim post mortem; 
in similem initiatus sum, et tandem familiaris est facta. Causa quod talis, est quia in societate loquuntur, quod utplurimum nesciunt; clarissimum indicium quod omnes in societates distincti sint, 
et quod omnia inde in societatum formas. </p>
