<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2098节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2098.</strong>“就离开他上升去了”表主进入先前的状态。这从前面所述清楚可知，因而是显而易见的，无需解释。主在世时经历了两种状态，一是谦卑的状态，二是荣耀的状态。这在前面早已说明（参看<a href="1603.htm">1603</a>，<a href="2033.htm">2033</a>节）。既然祂经历了两种状态，那么显然，祂也有两种直觉的状态。当祂发觉包含在本章直到此处内义中的事物时，祂处于荣耀的状态，即人性与神性融合的状态。祂不再处于这种直觉的事实，以“神向亚伯拉罕讲完了话，就离开他上升去了”这句经文来表达。</p>

And God went up from over Abraham. That this signifies the Lord's entrance into the former state, follows from what has been said, and therefore without explication. That during His life in the world 
the Lord had two states, one of humiliation, and the other of glorification, has been shown before (n. 1603, 2033); and as He had two states, it is evident that He had two states of perception. He was 
in a state of glorification, that is, of union of the Human with the Divine, when He perceived the things that are contained in the internal sense of this chapter up to this point; but that He was no 
longer in such perception is expressed by the words, "He left off speaking with him, and God went up from over Abraham." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2098</b></p><p><b>2098.</b>
'And God went up from over Abraham' means the Lord's entry into the state immediately previous to this. This is clear from what has been stated, and so is clear without explanation. The fact that the 
Lord experienced two kinds of state while He lived in the world, the first the state of humiliation, the second that of glorification, has been shown already in <a href="1603.htm">1603</a>, <a href="2033.htm">2033</a>. Since He experienced two kinds 
of state it is clear that He also had two states of perception. He was in a state of glorification, that is, of union of the Human with the Divine, when He perceived the things contained in the internal 
sense up to this point in this chapter. And the fact that He no longer had such perception is expressed by the statement that 'He finished speaking to him, and God went up from over Abraham'. </p>

</p><b>2098.</b>
`Et ascendit Deus desuper Abrahamo': quod significet ingressum Domini in priorem statum, constat inde, et sic absque explicatione.  Quod bini status Domino fuerint {1} cum vixit in mundo, unus humiliationis, 
alter glorificationis, prius n. 1603, 2033 ostensum (o)est; quia bini status, constat quod quoque bini status perceptionis [Ipsi] fuerint; in statu glorificationis, hoc est, unionis Homini cum 
Divino fuit, cum haec quae in hoc capite huc usque in sensu interno continentur, percepit: et quod non amplius in perceptione tali, exprimitur per haec quod `absolverit ad loquendum cum illo, et (x)ascenderit 
Deus desuper Abrahamo.' 	@1 Domini fuerit.$ </p>
