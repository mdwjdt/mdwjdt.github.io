<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3039节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3039.</strong>“祂必差遣使者在你面前”表神的旨意（Divine Providence）。这从圣言中“使者或天使”的含义清楚可知：“使者或天使”是指主；不过，从整个思路来看，它是指主的某个方面（参看<a href="1925.htm">1925</a>节），显然，在此是指神的旨意。在圣言中，主由“使者或天使”来表示。这是因为凡在天使的指示下借着先知和其他人所说的一切话皆来自主，即属于主自己。天上的天使还承认并直觉，没有丝毫良善与真理来自他们自己，全都来自主。他们的这种承认和直觉如此强烈，以致他们厌恶暗示任何其它观念的一切。正因如此，“使者或天使”，也就是良善的天使表示主，不过，表示主的某个方面，这从整个思路明显看出来。 </p>

He shall send His angel before thee. That this signifies the Divine providence, is evident from the signification of "angel" in the Word, as being the Lord; but what of the Lord is meant, appears from 
the series (see n. 1925); and that the Divine providence is meant here is evident. That the Lord is meant by "angels" in the Word, is because all that was spoken in the Word by the prophets and others 
under the dictation of angels, is from the Lord, that is, belongs to the Lord Himself. The angels in heaven also acknowledge and perceive that nothing of good and truth is from themselves, but all 
from the Lord; and this so fully that they are averse to all things that induce any other idea. Hence it is that by "angels," that is, by good angels, is meant the Lord; but what of His, becomes apparent 
from the series, or connection. </p>

'He will send His angel before you' means Divine Providence. This is clear from the meaning of 'angel' in the Word as the Lord, though which aspect of the Lord it is appears from the train of thought, 
as dealt with in <a href="1925.htm">1925</a>. The aspect meant here is clearly Divine Providence. The reason why the Lord is meant in the Word by 'angels' is that everything spoken in the Word through the Prophets and all 
others, though dictated by angels, is received from the Lord, that is, it is the Lord's Own. Angels in heaven also acknowledge and perceive that nothing good or true originates in themselves but in the 
Lord; indeed so great is their acknowledgement and perception that they turn away from everything that suggests any other idea. This explains why 'angels', that is to say, good ones, are used to mean 
the Lord, though which aspect of the Lord it is appears from the train of thought. </p>

</p><b>3039.</b>
`Ipse mittet angelum Suum coram te': quod significet Divinam Providentiam, constat ex significatione `angeli' in Verbo quod sit Dominus, sed quid Domini quod appareat ex serie, de qua n. 1925; quod 
hic Divina Providentia, constat.  Quod per `angelos' Dominus in Verbo intelligatur, est quia omne quod in Verbo locutum est per prophetas et reliquos dictantibus angelis, sit a Domino, hoc est, sit Ipsius 
Domini; angeli in caelo etiam agnoscunt et percipiunt quod nihil boni et veri a se sed a Domino, usque adeo ut aversentur omnia quae aliam ideam inducunt; inde est quod per angelos, nempe bonos, 
Dominus intelligatur, sed quid Domini quod appareat ex serie. </p>
