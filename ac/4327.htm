<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4327节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4327.</strong>像这样的总体和非自主的感官活动，如今就存在于那些处于信之良善与真理的人中间。但对那些陷入邪恶，并由此陷入虚假的人来说，无论他们的脸、言语，还是举止，都不再出现非自主的总体感官活动。取而代之的是一种模仿非自主性，或所谓自然性的自主性，他们从小就通过经常运用或习惯使得这种自主性变得如此。在这类人当中，这种感觉的性质可通过一种流注来说明；这种流注无声而又冰冷地流入整张脸，既流入脸的右侧，也流入左侧，并从那里伸向双眼，从左眼延伸到脸部。这一系列活动意味着大脑纤维侵入并控制了小脑纤维，结果，虚假、模仿、伪装和欺诈在里面掌权，而诚实和善良只是在外表上才能看见。它伸向左眼，从那里也进入脸部，这意味着他们以邪恶为其目的，并运用心智的理解部分来达到自己的目的；因为左眼表示理解部分。<br />如今这些人就是多半构成总体和非自主感官活动的人。而在古时，这种人是最为属天的，但如今他们是恶毒的，这一点从基督教界看得最为明显。他们为数众多，出现在后脑勺和背部下面，我在那里多次发现并察觉到他们。因为那些如今与这一感官活动有关的人都妄想向邻舍图谋恶计，表面上却装作友好的样子，甚至表现得亲密无间，他们的举止也是如此。他们说话也很和蔼可亲，好像比谁都仁慈，然而不仅是与他们交往之人，而且也是人类最苦毒的敌人。其思维曾传给我，它们都是极其恶毒、可憎的，充满残忍和杀戮。</p>

Such is the general involuntary sense at this day with those who are in the good and truth of faith. But with those who are in evil and thence in falsity, there is no longer any general involuntary sense 
which manifests itself, neither in face, speech, nor gesture; but there is a voluntary which counterfeits what is involuntary (or natural as it is called), which they have made such by frequent use 
or habit from infancy. The nature of this sense with such persons has been shown by an influx which was tacit and cold into the whole face, both into the right side of it and into the left, and determining 
itself therefrom toward the eyes, and extending itself from the left eye into the face; by which was signified that the fibers of the cerebrum have intruded themselves and control the fibers 
of the cerebellum, the result being that what is fictitious, pretended, counterfeit, and deceitful reigns within, while outwardly there appears what is sincere and good. Its being determined toward the 
left eye, and from there also into the face, signified that they have evil as their end, and use the intellectual part to obtain their end; for the left eye signifies the intellectual.  [2] These are 
they who at this day constitute for the most part the general involuntary sense. In ancient times it was these who were the most celestial of all; but at this day it is these who are the most wicked 
of all, and this especially from the Christian world. They are very numerous, and appear beneath the occiput and at the back, where I have often seen and perceived them. For those who at this day relate 
to this sense are they who think deceitfully and devise evils against the neighbor, and put on a friendly countenance, nay, most friendly, with gestures of like import, and speak kindly as if endued 
with charity above others, and yet are the bitterest enemies, not only of him with whom they have interaction, but also of the human race. Their thoughts have been communicated to me, and they were 
wicked and abominable, full of cruelties and butcheries. </p>

General and involuntary sensory activity like this exists today with those who are governed by the good and truth of faith. But with those who are subject to evil and therefore to falsity, no general 
sensory activity that is involuntary takes place any longer, neither in the face, nor in their speech, nor in their gestures. Instead there is a voluntary kind which is an imitation of the involuntary 
- or natural as it is called - and which they have made such by regular use or from habit since early childhood. What that voluntary kind of it with them is like was demonstrated by means of influx 
that was silent and cold into the whole face, into the right side as well as the left; from there it reached towards the eyes and extended from the left eye into the face. What was meant by this series 
of events was that the fibres of the cerebrum have intruded and taken control of the fibres of the cerebellum, and as a result that which is unauthentic, simulative, imitative, and fraudulent reigns 
inwardly, while sincerity and goodness are seen outwardly. Its reaching towards the left eye, and from there into the face also, meant that evil was the end they had in view and that they employed the 
understanding part of the mind to achieve their end, for the left eye means the understanding part. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 These at the present day are the ones who for the most part constitute general and involuntary 
sensory activity. In ancient times however such people were the most heavenly of all, but at the present day they are the most infamous of all, most especially those from the Christian world. They 
are many in number and they present themselves beneath the rear of the head and at the back, where I have seen and perceived them many times. For those who relate at the present day to that sensory activity 
are ones who think deceitfully and devise evil against the neighbour. They present a friendly, indeed a very friendly, countenance, and their gestures too are such. They also speak agreeably as 
though they excelled everyone else in charity, and yet they are most bitter enemies not only of any person with whom they have contact but also of the human race. Their thoughts have been communicated 
to me, and these were unmentionable and abominable, full of ideas of cruelty and butchery. </p>

</p><b>4327.</b>
Sensus communis involuntarius hodie talis est apud illos qui in bono et vero fidei sunt; sed apud illos qui in malo sunt et inde in falso, non amplius est aliquis sensus communis involuntarius qui se 
manifestat, nec in facie, nec in loquela, nec in gestu, sed est voluntarium quod mentitur involuntarium, seu naturale ut vocatur, (m)quod tale fecerunt per frequentem usum seu habitum ab infantia(n): 
qualis (c)is sensus apud illos sit, ostensum est per influxum qui erat tacitus et frigidus, in totam faciem, tam in dextram ejus partem quam in sinistram, et inde se determinans versus oculos, 
et ab oculo sinistro se extendens in faciem; quibus significabatur quod se fibrae cerebri ingesserint et imperent fibris cerebelli, et quod inde fictitium, simulatum, mentitum et dolosum intus regnet, 
et extus appareat sincerum et bonum; quod determinaretur versus oculum sinistrum et inde quoque in faciem, significabat quod pro fine habeant malam, et intellectuali parte utantur ad finem obtinendum, 
oculus enim sinister significat intellectuale.  [2] Illi hodie sunt qui quoad maximam partem constituunt sensum communem involuntarium, qui tamen antiquitus fuerunt omnium caelestissimi, 
at hodie sunt omnium scelestissimi, et hoc maxime ex orbe Christiano; sunt magno numero et apparent sub occipitio et ad tergum, ubi multoties a me visi (c)et percepti: nam qui illum sensum hodie referunt, 
sunt qui dolose cogitant et excogitant mala contra proximum, et praeferunt vultum amicum, immo amicissimum, et quoque gestus similes, et loquuntur suaviter tanquam charitate prae aliis praediti, 
et tamen infensissimi hostes sunt, non modo illius cum quo commercium habent, sed etiam generis humani; cogitationes eorum mihi communicatae sunt, quae erant nefandae et abominabiles, crudelitatibus 
et lanienis plenae. </p>
