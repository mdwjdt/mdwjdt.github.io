<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1963节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1963.</strong>“亚伯兰年八十六岁”表就通过试探的争战所获得的属天良善而言，主的状态。这从“八十”、“六”、“十”的含义清楚可知：“八十”的含义和“四十”差不多，这些数字表示试探，这在前面早已说明（<a href="730.htm">730</a>，<a href="862.htm">862</a>节）；“六”表争战，如前面所解释的（<a href="720.htm">720</a>，<a href="737.htm">737</a>，<a href="900.htm">900</a>节）；“十”表余留（<a href="576.htm">576</a>节）。对主而言，这些余留就是属天良善的获得物，主凭这些获得物将人性本质与神性本质融合（参看<a href="1906.htm">1906</a>节末尾）。这三个数字组成数字八十六，这个数字就包含这类事物，因而表示就通过试探的争战所获得的属天良善而言，主的状态。因为在圣言中，所有数字都表示真实事物（如前所示，<a href="482.htm">482</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="575.htm">575</a>，<a href="647.htm">647</a>，<a href="648.htm">648</a>，<a href="755.htm">755</a>，<a href="813.htm">813</a>节）。由于此处所提及的数字是年岁的数字，并且它们也出现在有关亚伯兰的历史叙事中，故表面上看，它们似乎并不表示这类事物。但是，凡圣言所记载的事物在抵达天使那里时，无不演变为属灵之义和属天之义。因为天使只具有属灵和属天的观念，当世人阅读圣言时，天使既不知道也不理解“八十六”是什么，他们也不关心夏甲给亚伯兰生以实玛利时，亚伯兰的年纪是多大。不过，当读到这样的数字时，这个数字所包含的真实事物会立刻呈现在他们面前。其它所有表述也一样，它们会照着内义所解读的样子呈现出来。</p>

Abram was a son of eighty years and six years. That this signifies the Lord's state in respect to the celestial good acquired by means of the combats of temptations, is evident from the signification 
of "eighty," in which number is involved much the same as in "forty;" and that these numbers signify temptations has been already shown (n. 730, 862); and from the signification of "six," as being combat, 
also explained before (n. 720, 737, 900); and further from the signification of "ten," as being remains (treated of, n. 576); which remains in the Lord's case were the possessions of celestial goods 
by which He united the Human Essence to the Divine Essence (n. 1906, at the end). These three numbers are components of the number eighty-six, in which such things are involved, and which thus signifies 
the Lord's state in regard to the celestial good acquired by means of the combats of temptations; for all numbers in the Word signify actual things (as before shown, n. 482, 487, 575, 647, 648, 
755, 813). As in this case the numbers mentioned are numbers of years, and as they are also mentioned in historical connection with Abram, it appears as if they were not significative of such things. 
But there is nothing written in the Word which does not pass into a spiritual and a celestial sense when it passes over to the angels; for angels are in none other than spiritual and celestial ideas, 
and when the Word is being read by a man, the angels neither know nor perceive what "eighty-six" is, nor do they care of what age Abram was when Hagar bare Ishmael to him; but from such a number, when 
read, the things involved in the numbers immediately come to them; and the same is the case with all the other expressions, as they have been explained in the internal sense. </p>

'Abram was a son of eighty-six years' means the Lord's state as regards celestial goods acquired through the conflicts brought about by temptations. This is clear from the meaning of 'eighty', a number 
that is similar to forty in what it embodies, which, as shown already in <a href="730.htm">730</a>, <a href="862.htm">862</a>, means temptations; from the meaning of 'six' as conflict, also dealt with already in <a href="720.htm">720</a>, <a href="737.htm">737</a>, <a href="900.htm">900</a>; as well as from 
the meaning of 'ten' as remnants, dealt with in <a href="576.htm">576</a>. With the Lord these remnants were acquisitions of celestial goods by which He united the Human Essence to the Divine Essence; see <a href="1906.htm">1906</a> (end). These 
three numbers go to make up the number of eighty-six, which embodies such matters within it, and so means the Lord's state as regards celestial goods that had been acquired through the conflicts brought 
about by temptations; for all numbers in the Word mean real things, as shown already in <a href="482.htm">482</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="575.htm">575</a>, <a href="647.htm">647</a>, <a href="648.htm">648</a>, <a href="755.htm">755</a>, <a href="813.htm">813</a>. As the numbers mentioned here<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> are numbers of years, and as they in fact 
occur in a historical narrative regarding Abram, it does seem as though they are not used to mean such things. But nothing is written in the Word that does not pass into a spiritual or celestial sense 
when it reaches the angels, for with angels none other than spiritual and celestial ideas exist. When the Word is being read by man, angels neither know nor perceive what eighty-six is, nor are they 
concerned about what age Abram was when Hagar bore him Ishmael. Rather, when such a number is read, the real things embodied in that number instantly present themselves to them, as when all other expressions 
are read, these present themselves as the things which they have been shown to mean in the internal sense.

`Abram filius octoginta annorum et sex annorum': quo significet statum Domini quoad caelestia acquisita bona per pugna tentationum, constat a significatione `octoginta' qui numerus simile involvit ac 
`quadraginta,' quae quod significent tentationes, ostensum est prius n. 730, 862; et a significatione `sex' quod sit pugna, de qua etiam prius n. 720, 737, 900; tum quoque a significatione `decem' quod 
sint reliquiae, de qua n. 576; quae reliquiae apud Dominum fuerunt acquisitiones caelestium bonorum quibus univit Humanum Essentiam Divinae, n. 1906 ad fin. Ex his tribus numeris compositus est numerus 
octoginta et sex, qui talia involvit, (m)ita {1} significat statum Domini quoad caelestia acquisita bona per pugnas tentationum(n): omnes enim numeri in Verbo significant res, ut ostensum prius 
n. 482, 487, 575, 647, 648, 755, 813.  Hic quia numeri annorum sunt, et quidem historice nominati de Abram, apparet sicut (o)quod non significativi talium forent; sed in Verbo nihil scriptum est quod 
non in spiritualem et caelestem sensum transeat dum ad angelos, angeli enim non in aliis quam spiritualibus et caelestibus ideis sunt; ii dum legitur Verbum ab homine, non sciunt nec percipiunt quid octoginta 
et sex, nec curant qua aetate fuit Abram cum Hagar ei peperit Ismaelem, sed ex numero tali lecto, ilico obveniunt illis quae numeri involvunt; et ex reliquis {2} sicut in sensu interno explicata 
sunt. 	@1 ideo.$ 	@2 reliqua.$ </p>
