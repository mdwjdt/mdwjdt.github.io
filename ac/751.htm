<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第751节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>751.</strong>由于此处所阐述的主题是被称为挪亚的新教会成员的试探，并且没几个人知道何为试探（因为如今很少有人经历这种试探，那些经历的人只知道它是自己本身固有、就这样经受的某种东西），所以有必要简要解释一下。如前所述，有些恶灵会在试探期间唤起一个人的虚假与邪恶。事实上，他们会从他的记忆中提取出他自小曾思想和做过的任何事。恶灵做这类事时的狡诈恶毒非语言所能形容。不过，与他同在的天使会提取出他的良善与真理，从而保卫他。这种争战就是此人所感受和觉察到的，并使良心遭受痛苦和折磨。<br />②试探有两种，一种涉及觉知之物，一种涉及意愿之物。当涉及觉知之物时，恶灵只是唤起他曾做过的恶行，也就是此处“不洁净的牲畜”所指的，并以此指控和谴责他。他们甚至还会唤起他的善行，也就是此处“洁净的牲畜”所指的，但他们却千方百计地败坏这些行为。同时，他们也会唤起他的思维，就是此处“鸟”所指的，此外还唤起“爬在土地上的一切”所指的那类事物。不过，这种试探相对温和，给人的感觉只是他忆起了这类经历，并由此产生了某种焦虑。<br />③然而，当人的试探涉及意愿之物时，所唤起的其行为和思维不是那么多。相反，会有一些恶魔（如这类恶灵被称呼的那样）用他沉浸其中的恶欲和污秽的爱充满他，从而利用这人的欲望实施攻击。他们行动如此恶毒和隐秘，以致人很难相信是他们在这种事。实际上，他们顷刻之间就充满其欲望的生命，并几乎立即将善与真的情感反转、改变为恶与假的情感，以至于这人只知道这些事出于他自己，是从他自己的自由意志中涌出的。这种试探最为严厉，给人的感觉是一种内心的痛苦和燃烧的折磨，对此，容后再述。我通过大量经历得以发觉并知道，这是千真万确的，我还知道，这些恶灵或魔鬼什么时候，以及如何涌入并泛滥，他们是谁，来自何处。蒙主慈悲，我会在后面详述这些经历。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]751.</strong> The subject under discussion here is the trials of the people in the new church called Noah, but few if any know what goes on in times of trial because few today experience them. Those who do are wholly convinced that it is something inherent in themselves that causes them to suffer. In consequence, let me offer a brief explanation of the matter here.<br />During such times it is evil spirits who stir up our falsities and evil, as mentioned [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_751/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_653" target=_top>653</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_751/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_705#subsection-2-3" target=_top>705:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_751/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_711" target=_top>711</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_751/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_741" target=_top>741</a>]. From our memory they stir up everything we have ever considered or committed since childhood. Evil spirits are able to do this with such consummate skill and malice that words cannot describe it. The angels who accompany us, though, bring out the goodness and truth that we have and use it to defend us. The conflict between the parties is what we sense and feel, and it causes our conscience to gnaw at us and torment us.<br />[2] There are two kinds of trial, one testing the intellect, and the other the will. In struggles involving our intellectual processes, evil spirits stir up only the following: the wrong we have done (symbolized here by the unclean animals), for which they accuse and condemn us; our good deeds (symbolized by the clean animals), which they twist in a thousand ways; our thoughts (symbolized by the birds); and the things symbolized by the animals creeping on the ground. A struggle of this kind is mild, and we perceive it only as the memory of such things, along with a kind of resulting anxiety.<br />[3] A struggle involving the urges of our will, on the other hand, does not stimulate the memory of our thoughts and deeds in this way. Rather, wicked demons (a name for evil spirits of this type) kindle in us the cravings and vile kinds of love that already permeate us, and so they attack us with our own longings. This they manage so malevolently and covertly that no one could ever believe it was their doing. It takes them only a moment to infiltrate the vital energy that lies behind our longings. In almost no time they change and redirect our desire for goodness and truth into a desire for evil and falsity. We end up totally unaware that this event did not happen on its own, that it did not unfold spontaneously. This kind of trial is very severe, and we perceive it as an excruciating, burning pain inside. It will be discussed below [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_751/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_755" target=_top>755-757</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_751/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_760" target=_top>760</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_751/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_845" target=_top>845</a>].<br />The truth of all this I was privileged to see and recognize from repeated experience. I also learned when it was that evil spirits and demons poured and flooded in, where they came from, who they were, and what their methods were. These experiences too will later be described individually, by the Lord's divine mercy.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg refers, perhaps, to such experiences as related in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_751/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_814" target=_top>814-831</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_751/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_938" target=_top>938-969</a>. His Journal of Dreams (Swedenborg 2001b) and his diary Spiritual Experiences (Swedenborg 1998-2002 and Swedenborg 1978) offer examples too numerous to cite. [LHC, RS] </p>

As the subject here treated of is the temptation of the man of the new church called "Noah" and as few if any know the nature of temptations (because at this day there are few who undergo such temptations, 
and those who do undergo them know not but that it is something inherent in themselves which thus suffers), the subject shall be briefly explained. There are evil spirits who as before said in 
times of temptation call up a man's falsities and evils, and in fact call forth from his memory whatever he has thought and done from his infancy. Evil spirits do this with a skill and a malignity so 
great as to be indescribable. But the angels with the man draw out his goods and truths, and thus defend him. This combat is what is felt and perceived by the man, causing the pain and remorse of conscience. 
 [2] There are two kinds of temptations, one as to things of the understanding, the other as to those of the will. When a man is tempted as to things of the understanding, the evil spirits call 
up only the evil things he has been guilty of (here signified by the "unclean beasts"), and accuse and condemn him; they do indeed also call up his good deeds (here signified by the "clean beasts"), 
but pervert them in a thousand ways. At the same time they call up what he has thought (here signified by the "fowl"), and such things also as are signified by "everything that creepeth upon the ground." 
[3] But this temptation is light, and is perceived only by the recalling of such things to mind and a certain anxiety therefrom. But when a man is tempted as to the things of the will, his thoughts 
and doings are not so much called up, but there are evil genii (as evil spirits of this kind may be called) who inflame him with their cupidities and foul loves with which he also is imbued, and thus 
combat by means of the man's cupidities themselves, which they do so maliciously and secretly that it could not be believed to be from them. For in a moment they infuse themselves into the life of 
his cupidities, and almost instantly invert and change an affection of good and truth into an affection of evil and falsity, so that the man cannot possibly know but that it is done of his own self, 
and comes forth of his own will. This temptation is most severe, and is perceived as an inward pain and tormenting fire. Of this more will be said hereafter. That such is the case has been given me to 
perceive and know by manifold experience; and also when and how the evil spirits or genii were flowing in and inundating, and who and whence they were; concerning which experiences, of the Lord's Divine 
mercy special and particular mention will be made hereafter. </p>

Since the subject here is the temptation of the member of the new Church called Noah, and since few, if any, know what temptations are, because nowadays few people undergo such temptations - and those 
who do are not aware of anything other than the feeling that it is something within them which is suffering in this way - let a brief explanation be given. There are evil spirits who at that time activate 
a person's falsities and evils, as has been stated. Indeed they draw out of his memory whatever he has thought and carried out since early childhood. Evil spirits can do this so cleverly and wickedly 
as to defy description. But the angels who are with him draw out his goods and truths, and in this way defend him. This conflict is what the person feels and perceives in himself and is what causes 
the sting and torment of conscience. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 There are two kinds of temptation, the first involving things of the understanding, the second those of the will. When a person's temptation involves those 
of the understanding, evil spirits activate only the evil deeds he has carried out, which are meant here by 'unclean beasts'. And with these they accuse and condemn. They even activate his good deeds 
as well, which are also meant here by the 'clean beasts'; but these they corrupt in a thousand ways. At the same time they also activate his thoughts, which are also meant here by 'bird', and in 
addition they activate the things meant here by 'things creeping over the ground'. This kind of temptation however is mild and is perceived only through the recollection of such experiences, and a kind 
of mental anguish resulting from this. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 When however someone's temptation involves things of the will, it is not so much his deeds and thoughts that are activated. Instead there are evil genii, 
as evil spirits of this type may be called, who inflame him with the evil desires and the foul loves in which he is steeped, and in this way direct their attack through the person's very desires. They 
do this so wickedly and secretly that one cannot possibly believe it is they who are doing it. In fact they worm their way in no time at all into the life of his desires, and almost instantaneously 
twist and convert the affection for good and truth into the affection for evil and falsity. They act in such a way that the individual inevitably thinks that these things come from himself and flow forth 
of his own free will. This kind of temptation is very severe, and is felt as inward pain and burning torment. This subject is dealt with later on. I have been allowed from much experience to know 
and realize that this is true, and to know also when evil spirits or genii were flowing in and overwhelming, and from where, who they were and how they did it. In the Lord's Divine mercy these experiences 
will be described in detail later on.  </p>

Hic quia agitur de tentatione hominis Ecclesiae novae Noahus dictae, et paucis, si ulli, notum est quomodo se tentationes habent, quia pauci hodie tales tentationes subeunt, et qui subeunt, non sciunt 
aliter quam quod aliquid in ipsis sit inhaerenter quod sic patitur, breviter licet rem exponere: sunt mali spiritus qui tunc, ut dictum, excitant falsa et mala hominis, et quidem ex ejus memoria, quaecumque 
ab infantia cogitavit et patravit; hoc mali spiritus tam solerter et malitiose facere possunt ut non describi possit; sed angeli qui apud eum, depromunt ejus bona et vera, et sic defendunt hominem; 
haec pugna est quae sentitur et percipitur apud hominem, et causatur conscientiae morsum et cruciatum. Sunt tentationes duplicis generis, unum quoad intellectualia, alterum quoad voluntaria; cum 
tentatur homo quoad intellectualia, tunc spiritus mali solum facta ejus mala quae patravit, quae hic significantur per 'bestias immundas,' excitant, et accusant et damnant; tum quidem facta ejus bona, 
quae hic quoque significantur per 'bestias mundas,' sed illa mille modis pervertunt; simul etiam 'excitant cogitata ejus, quae hic quoque significantur per 'avem,' porro etiam illa quae hic significantur 
per 'repentia super humo,' sed haec tentatio levis est, et percipitur solum per revocationem talium in memoriam, et quandam inde anxietatem. Cum autem tentatur homo quoad voluntaria, tunc non excitantur 
ita facta et cogitata, sed sunt genii mali, ita vocari possunt hujus generis spiritus mali, qui incendunt eum suis cupiditatibus et foedis amoribus quibus imbutus, et sic per ipsas hominis cupiditates 
pugnant; quod tam malitiose et clandestine faciunt ut nusquam credi possit quod ab illis; momento enim se infundunt in vitam ejus cupiditatum, ut et vertunt et flectunt fere in instanti affectionem 
boni et veri in affectionem {1}mali et falsi, ut nusquam aliter scire possit homo quam quod ex semet fiat et sponte sic fluat; haec tentatio est gravissima, et percipitur ut dolor internus et 
ignis crucians; de hac in sequentibus agitur. Quod ita se res habeat, ex multiplici experientia nosse et scire mihi datum, tum quando, undenam, quinam, et quomodo mali spiritus aut genii influxerunt 
et inundarunt; de quibus experientiis, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus singillatim dicetur.   @1 malam I.$ </p>
