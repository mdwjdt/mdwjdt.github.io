<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第207节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>207.</strong>创世记3:6 于是女人见那棵树好作食物，也悦人的眼目，且是可喜爱的，能使人聪明，就摘下果子来吃了，又给她丈夫，她丈夫也吃了。<br />“好作食物”表贪欲，“悦人的眼目”表幻相，“可喜爱的，能使人聪明”表乐趣，这些属于人的自我，亦即“女人”，“丈夫也吃了”表理性的认同（<a href="265.htm">265</a>节）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]207.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_207/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_6" target=_top>Genesis 3:6</a>. And the woman saw that the tree was good for eating, and that it was appealing to the eyes, and a tree desirable for lending insight. And she took some of its fruit, and she ate and gave to her husband too, who was with her, and he ate.<br />Good for eating means intense desire. Appealing to the eyes means delusion. Desirable for lending insight means sensual pleasure. These three are properties of our selfhood (or the woman). Her husband's eating symbolizes the rational mind's consent (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_207/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_265" target=_top>265</a>). </p>

Verse 6. And the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to give intelligence, and she took of the fruit thereof and did eat, and she 
gave also to her husband [vir] with her, and he did eat. "Good for food" signifies cupidity; "pleasant to the eyes" phantasy; and" desirable to give intelligence" pleasure: these are of the Own, or "woman:" 
by the "husband eating" is signified the consent of the rational (n. 265). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 207</b></p><p><b>207.</b>
Verse 6 And the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was appetizing to the eyes, and a tree desirable for imparting intelligence; and she took from its fruit and ate; and she also gave 
to her husband with her, and he ate.  </p>
<p>'Good for food' means inordinate desire. 'Appetizing to the eyes' means delusion. 'Desirable for imparting intelligence' means base pleasure. These statements 
refer to the proprium, which is the woman. 'Her husband ate' means that the rational conceded, <a href="265.htm">265</a>.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 207</b>
</p><b>207.</b>
Vers. 6.  Et vidit mulier, quod bona arbor ad esum, et quod appetibilis ea oculis, et desiderabilis arbor ad dandum intelligentiam, et sumpsit ex fructu ejus, et edit; et dedit etiam vero suo secum, 
et comedit. 'Bona ad esum' significat cupiditatem: 'appetibilis oculis' phantasiam: 'desiderabilis ad dandum intelligentiam' voluptatem: haec sunt proprii seu mulieris: per 'virum, quod comederit' significatur 
rationale quod 'consenserit, n. 265. </p>
