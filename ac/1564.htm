<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1564节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1564.</strong>“也有牛群、羊群、帐棚”表外在人所富有的事物。这从接下来所论述的“牛群、羊群、帐棚”的含义清楚可知。此处它们表示外在人的所有物，因为如前所述，罗得代表主的外在人。外在人的所有物分为两类，一类能与内在人一致，另一类则不能。此处的“牛群、羊群、帐棚”表示那些不能一致的事物，这从下面第7节的经文清楚可知，即“亚伯兰的牧人和罗得的牧人起了纷争”。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1564.</strong> The symbolism of he had flock and herd and tents as that which the outer self has in abundance can be seen from the symbolism of flock, herd, and tents, discussed directly below. Here they symbolize the possessions of the outer self, because Lot, again, represents the Lord's outer self.<br />The outer self harbors two kinds of traits: those compatible with the inner self and those incompatible. The flock, herd, and tents here symbolize incompatible traits, as indicated by the words that follow in verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1564/bible_king-james-version_genesis_13_7" target=_top>7</a>: "And there was controversy between the herders of Abram's livestock and the herders of Lot's livestock." </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1564</b></p><p><b>1564.</b>
Had flock and herd, and tents. That this signifies the things with which the external man abounds, is evident from the signification of "flock," "herd," and "tents," explained just below. They here signify 
the possessions of the external man; for by Lot, as before said, is represented the Lord's external man. There are two classes of possessions in the external man, namely, such as can agree with 
the internal, and such as cannot agree. By "flock, herd, and tents" are here signified those things which cannot agree, as is evident from what follows-"and there was strife between the herdmen of Abram's 
cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle" (verse 7). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1564</b></p><p><b>1564.</b>
'He had Rocks and herds and tents' means the things that the external man has in abundance. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'flocks, herds, and tents' to be dealt with immediately below. Here 
they mean the possessions of the external man, for as has been stated, Lot represents the Lord's external man. Two types of things exist with the external man, namely those which can agree with the internal 
and those which cannot. 'Flocks, herds, and tents' here means those which cannot agree, as is clear from what follows in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=verse%207:&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">verse 7:</a> 'And there was strife between Abram's herdsmen and Lot's herdsman.' </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1564</b>
</p><b>1564.</b>
'Fuit grex et armentum et tentoria': quod significet illa quibus externus homo abundat, constare potest a significatione 'gregis, armenti et tentoriorum,' de quibus mox intra; hic significant possessiones 
externi hominis; nam per 'Lotum,' ut dictum, repraesentatur Domini externus homo: sunt bina apud externum hominem, nempe quae concordare possunt cum interno, et quae non concordare; per 'gregem, 
armentum, et tentoria' hic significantur illa quae non concordare possunt, ut constat ex illis quae sequuntur, Et fuit lis inter pastores pecoris Abrami, et inter pastores pecoris Loti, vers. 7. </p>
