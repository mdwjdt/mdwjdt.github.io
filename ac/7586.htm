<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7586.</strong>出埃及记9:27-30.法老打发人召摩西、亚伦来，对他们说，这一次我犯了罪了，耶和华是公义的，我和我的百姓是邪恶的。请你们求耶和华，这神的声音和冰雹已经够了；我将容你们去，你们不可再留下来了。摩西对他说，我一出城，就要向耶和华伸开我的手掌，声音必止住，也不再有冰雹，叫你知道这地是属耶和华的。至于你和你的臣仆，我知道你们还是不惧怕耶和华神的面。<br />“法老打发人召摩西、亚伦来”表神之真理的出现。“对他们说”表谦卑。“这一次我犯了罪了”表与真理和良善的分离。“耶和华是公义的，我和我的百姓是邪恶的”表神性良善无法容忍侵扰者的恶毒，当前的苦难就是由此而来的后果。“请你们求耶和华”表他们要代求。“这神的声音和冰雹已经够了”表如果这些虚假不结束。“我将容你们去，你们不可再留下来了”表他们将离开他们，不再拦阻他们。“摩西对他说”表回答。“我一出城”表分离。“就要向耶和华伸开我的手掌”表代求。“声音必止住，也不再有冰雹”表这种状态的结束。“叫你知道这地是属耶和华的”表由此认识到，主是教会的独一神。“至于你和你的臣仆，我知道你们还是不惧怕耶和华神的面”表那些进行侵扰的人还不惧怕主。</p>

Verses 27-30. And Pharaoh sent and called Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time; Jehovah is just, and I and my people are wicked. Supplicate ye unto Jehovah, for there hath been 
enough of voices of God and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer. And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread out my palms unto Jehovah, and the 
voices shall cease, and there shall be no more hail; that thou mayest know that the earth is Jehovah's. And as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the face of Jehovah God. "And 
Pharaoh sent, and called Moses and Aaron," signifies the presence of the law Divine; "and said unto them," signifies humiliation; "I have sinned this time," signifies separation from truth and good; 
"Jehovah is just, and I and my people are wicked," signifies that Divine good could not endure the malice of those who infest, and that this is the consequence; "supplicate ye unto Jehovah" signifies 
that they should intercede; "for there hath been enough of voices of God and hail," signifies if these falsities were to cease; "and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer," signifies that they 
would leave them, and they should be no longer detained; "and Moses said unto him," signifies the answer; "As soon as I am gone out of the city," signifies separation; "I will spread out my palms unto 
Jehovah," signifies intercession; "and the voices shall cease, and there shall be no more hail," signifies the end of this state; "that thou mayest know that the earth is Jehovah's," signifies that 
from this it is known that the Lord is the only God of the church; "and as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the face of Jehovah God," signifies that they who infest are not 
yet in fear of the Lord. </p>

Verses 27-30 And Pharaoh sent and called Moses and Aaron, and said to them, I have sinned this time; Jehovah is righteous, and I and my people are wicked. Plead with Jehovah, there have been enough of 
God's voices<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and of hail; and I will send you away, and you will not continue to remain. And Moses said to him, As I am going out of the city I will spread out my palms towards Jehovah; the voices' 
will cease, and there will be no more hail, in order that you may know that the earth is Jehovah's. And [as for] you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear the face of Jehovah God.  </p>
<p>'And 
Pharaoh sent and called Moses and Aaron' means the presence of the law of God. 'And said to them' means self-abasement. 'I have sinned this time' means a separation from truth and good. 'Jehovah is 
righteous, and I and my people are wicked' means that Divine Good could not tolerate the malevolence of the molesters, and that the current affliction had occurred as a result of this. 'Plead with Jehovah' 
means that they should intercede. 'There have been enough of voices and hail' means should those falsities come to an end. 'And I will send you away, and you will not continue to remain' means 
that they would leave them and no longer hold them back. 'And Moses said to him' means the reply. 'As I am going out of the city' means a separation. 'I will spread out my palms towards Jehovah' means 
intercession. 'The voices will cease, and there will be no more hail' means the end of that state. 'In order that you may know that the earth is Jehovah's' means that from this it may be recognized that 
the Lord is the only God of the Church. 'And [as for] you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear the face of Jehovah God' means that those engaged in molestation do not yet live in fear 
of the Lord.

Vers. 27-30.  Et misit Pharao, et vocavit Moschen et Aharonem, et dixit ad illos, Peccavi vice hac, Jehovah justus, et ego et populus meus improbi.  Supplicate ad Jehovam, et satis ab esse voces Dei 
et grando; et dimittam vos, et non addetis stare.  Et dixit ad illum Moscheh, Sicut exire me urbe, expandam palmas meas ad Jehovam, voces cessabunt, et grando non erit amplius, propterea ut scias quod 
Jehovae terra.  Et tu et servi tui, scio quod (x)nondum timeatis a facie Jehovae Dei.  `Et misit Pharao, et vocavit Moschen et Aharonem' significat praesentiam legis Divinae: `et dixit ad illos' significat 
humiliationem: `Peccavi vice hac' significat separationem a vero et bono: `Jehovah justus, et ego et populus meus improbi' significat quod Divinum Bonum non sufferre potuerit malitiam infestantium, 
et quod inde hoc: `supplicate ad Jehovam' significat ut intercedant: `et satis ab esse voces et grando' significat si cessant falsa illa: `et dimittam vos, et non addetis stare' significat quod 
relinquerent illos, et non detinerentur amplius: `et dixit ad illum Moscheh' significat responsum: `Sicut exire me urbe' significat separationem: `expandam palmas meas ad Jehovam' significat intercessionem: 
`voces cessabunt, et grando non erit amplius' significat finem status illius: `propterea ut scias quod Jehovae terra' significat quod inde notum quod Dominus sit solus Deus Ecclesiae: `et tu et 
servi tui, scio quod nondum timeatis a facie Jehovae Dei' significat quod qui infestant nondum in timore sint pro Domino. </p>
