<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1425节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1425.</strong>创世记12:4. 亚伯兰就照着耶和华吩咐他的去了，罗得也和他同去。亚伯兰出哈兰的时候是年七十五岁的儿子。<br />如前所述，“亚伯兰”代表主的人性本质。“亚伯兰就照着耶和华吩咐他的去了”表向着神性事物发展。“罗得也和他同去”表感官知觉。“亚伯兰是年七十五岁的儿子”表尚没有那么多的神性。“出哈兰的时候”表主正在经历的朦胧状态。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1425.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1425/bible_king-james-version_genesis_12_4" target=_top>Genesis 12:4</a>. And Abram went, as Jehovah had spoken to him, and with him went Lot. And Abram was a son of seventy-five years when he left Haran.<br />Abram, as noted, represents the Lord's human quality. And Abram went, as Jehovah had spoken to him, symbolizes progress toward divine characteristics. And with him went Lot symbolizes the senses; Lot represents the Lord as a sensory, physical being. And Abram was a son of seventy-five years means that he did not yet have much divinity. When he left Haran symbolizes a shadowy state for the Lord. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1425</b></p><p><b>1425.</b>
Verse 4. And Abram went as Jehovah spoke unto him; and Lot went with him. And Abram was a son of five years and seventy years when he went forth out of Haran. By "Abram," as already said, is represented 
the Lord as to His Human Essence. "And Abram went as Jehovah spoke unto him" signifies His progression toward Divine things; "and Lot went with him," signifies what is sensuous; by "Lot" is represented 
the Lord as to His sensuous and corporeal man; "and Abram was a son of five years and seventy years," signifies that as yet there was not very much of the Divine; "when he went forth out of Haran," 
signifies an obscure state of the Lord. </p>

Verse 4 And Abram went, as Jehovah had told him; and Lot went with him. And Abram was a son of seventy-five years when he went out of Haran. </p>
<p>As has been stated, 'Abram' represents the Lord as regards 
His Human Essence. 'And Abram went, as Jehovah had told him' means an advance towards Divine things. 'And Lot went with him' means sensory perception -'Lot' representing the Lord as regards His sensory 
and bodily man. 'And Abram was a son of seventy-five years' means that as yet there was not so much of the Divine. 'When he went out of Haran' means an obscure state which the Lord was experiencing. </p>

</p><b>1425.</b>
Vers. 4.  Et ivit Abram, quemadmodum locutus ad illum Jehovah, et ivit cum illo Lot; et Abram filius quinque annorum et septuaginta annorum, cum exivit e Harane.  Per 'Abramum,' ut dictum, repraesentatur 
Dominus quoad Humanam Ipsius Essentiam. 'Et ivit Abram, quemadmodum ad illum locutus Jehovah' significat progressionem ad Divina:  'et ivit cum illo Lot' significat sensuale:  per 'Lot' repraesentatur 
Dominus quoad sensualem et corporeum Ipsius hominem:  'et Abram filius quinque annorum et septuaginta annorum' significat quod adhuc non ita multum Divini:  'cum exivit ex Haran' significat statum 
Domini obscurum. </p>
