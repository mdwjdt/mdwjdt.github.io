<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>34.</strong>爱与信不可分割，因为它们构成一体。故当“光体”首次被提及时，谓语是单数。在这方面，让我报告一些奇妙之事。属天的天使专注于爱主，这爱使他们获得一切信仰的认知，也赋予他们活泼、光明、不可言说的觉性。相比之下，学习信仰教义却缺乏爱的灵，他们的生命是冷漠的，光明是黯淡的，以致不能靠近天堂之门，只能转身逃跑。有的自称信主，而事实上，他们并未照主的教导生活。主论到他们说：“凡称呼我主啊主啊的人不能都进天堂，惟独遵行我天父旨意的人才能进去。当那日，必有许多人对我说，主啊，主啊，我们不是奉你的名传道吗？”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.21.htm">7:21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.22.htm">22</a>）<br />由此可见，拥有爱的人也拥有信，故拥有属天的生命。自称拥有信，却不以爱生活的人，却非如此。缺乏爱的信，好比冬天缺乏温暖的阳光，万物枯萎消亡。反之，发自爱的信，好比春天温暖的阳光，万物生长兴旺。太阳的温暖是生发的媒介，属灵属天之物与之相似，圣经常用尘世之物来象征之。主在预告时代的终结时，也将不信和缺乏爱之信比作冬天，他说：“你们应当祈求，叫这些事（逃走）不在冬天临到，因为在那些日子必有灾难。”（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可13.18.htm">13:18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可13.19.htm">19</a>）“逃走”指末后的日子，也指一个人将死的日子，“冬天”指缺乏爱的生命，“灾难的日子”指人在灵界的惨状。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]34.</strong> Love and faith can never be separated, because they make a single unit. This is why the sources of light when first mentioned are treated as grammatically singular in the statement, "Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens."{*1} Let me report some surprising facts in this connection.<br />Because the Lord gives heavenly angels this kind of love, love reveals all religious knowledge to them. Love also gives them such a living and shining intelligence that it can hardly be described.<br />For spirits who learn the doctrinal tenets of faith but lack love, on the other hand, life is so chill and the light so dim that they cannot even approach the near side of the threshold to heaven's entrance hall without fleeing in retreat.<br />Some say that they had believed in the Lord; but in actuality they had not lived as he taught. The Lord speaks of them this way in Matthew:<br />Not everyone saying "Lord! Lord!" to me will enter the kingdom of the heavens, but the one doing my will. Many will say to me on that day, "Lord! Lord! Haven't we prophesied in your name?" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_34/bible_king-james-version_matthew_7_21-22" target=_top>Matthew 7:21-22</a>)<br />See also what follows there, up to the end of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_34/bible_king-james-version_matthew_7_1-29" target=_top>Matthew 7</a>.<br />[2] All this makes it clear that people who have love also have faith and consequently heavenly life. The same cannot be said of those who claim to have faith but do not lead a loving life.<br />A life of faith without love is like sunlight without warmth — the type of light that occurs in winter, when nothing grows and everything droops and dies. Faith rising out of love, on the contrary, is like light from the sun in spring, when everything grows and flourishes. Warmth from the sun is the fertile agent. The same is true in spiritual and heavenly affairs, which are typically represented in the Word by objects found in nature and human culture.<br />Nonbelief and belief without love are in fact compared to winter by the Lord in Mark where he made predictions concerning the close of the age:<br />Pray that your flight not occur in winter, as those will be days of distress. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_34/bible_king-james-version_mark_13_18-19" target=_top>Mark 13:18-19</a>)<br />The "flight" refers to the final days and to an individual's final days before death as well. "Winter" is a life devoid of love. The "days of distress" are the person's wretched condition in the other life.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On this treatment of "lights" as a singular, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_34/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_30#subsection-2-2" target=_top>30:2</a> and note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_34/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_30" target=_top>30</a>.

Love and faith admit of no separation, because they constitute one and the same thing; and therefore when mention is first made of "luminaries" they are regarded as one, and it is said, "Let there be 
[sit] luminaries in the expanse of the heavens." Concerning this circumstance it is permitted me to relate the following wonderful particulars. The celestial angels, by virtue of the celestial love in 
which they are from the Lord, are from that love in all the knowledges of faith, and are in such a life and light of intelligence that scarcely anything of it can be described. But, on the other hand, 
spirits who are in the knowledge of the doctrinals of faith, without love, are in such a coldness of life and obscurity of light that they cannot even approach the first threshold of the court of the 
heavens, but flee back again. Some of them, while not living according to His precepts, say that they have believed in the Lord, and it was of such that the Lord said in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Not everyone 
that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he that doeth My will: many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied through Thy name (Matt. 7:21, 
22, to the end).[2] Hence it is evident that those who are in love are also in faith, and thereby in heavenly life, but not those who say they are in faith, and are not in the life of love. The life 
of faith without love is like the light of the sun without heat, as in the time of winter, when nothing grows, but all things are torpid and dead; whereas faith proceeding from love is like the light 
of the sun in the time of spring, when all things grow and flourish in consequence of the sun's fructifying heat. It is precisely similar in regard to spiritual and heavenly things, which are usually 
represented in the Word by such as exist in the world and on the face of the earth. No faith; and faith without love, are also compared by the Lord to "winter" where He foretells the consummation of 
the age, in Mark: </p>
<p>     Pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, for those shall be days of affliction (Mark 13:18-19). "Flight" means the last time, and also that of every man when he dies. "Winter" 
is a life destitute of love; the "day of affliction" is its miserable state in the other life. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 34</b></p><p><b>34.</b>
Love and faith cannot possibly be separated for they constitute one and the same thing. This is why, when first the [great] lights are dealt with and they are taken to be one, it is said [using a singular 
verb with a plural noun], 'Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens'. Let some marvels relating to this be mentioned here. Since celestial angels possess from the Lord that kind of love, 
they possess by virtue of that love every cognition of faith, and by virtue of that love the kind of life and light of understanding that almost defies description altogether. On the other hand spirits 
who without love have a knowledge of the doctrinal matters concerning faith live such cold lives and are in such dull light that they cannot approach even the outer gateway to heaven before running 
off in the opposite direction. Some claim to have believed in the Lord, but they have not lived according to His teaching. The Lord refers to these people in Matthew as follows,  </p>
<blockquote>
Not everyone who 
says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does My will. Many will say to me on that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name? and so on. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%207:21,%2022-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 7:21, 22-end</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
From this is clear that those who have love have faith as well, and so heavenly life, whereas those who claim to have faith and yet have none of the life inherent in love do not. The life of faith devoid 
of love is like sunlight devoid of warmth, as is the case in wintertime when nothing grows and every single thing is inactive and dies off. But faith deriving from love is like the sunlight in springtime 
when everything grows and blossoms, for it is the warmth of the sun that brings it out. It is similar with spiritual and celestial things, which are normally represented in the Word by the things 
found in the world and on earth. An absence of faith, and faith devoid of love, are also compared by the Lord to winter where He foretold the close of the age in Mark,  </p>
<blockquote>
Pray that your flight 
may not happen in winter, for those will be days of affliction. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2013:18,%2019&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 13:18, 19</a>.   
</blockquote>
'Flight' means the final period, also the time when a person dies; 'winter' is life which is destitute of love, 'days 
of affliction' his wretched condition in the next life.  </p>

</p><b>34.</b>
Amor et fides nusquam separari possunt, quia unum et idem constituunt; quare cum primum agitur de luminaribus, pro uno accipiuntur, et dicitur 'sit luminaria in expanso caelorum.' Mirabilia de hoc licet 
referre; caelestes angeli, quia a Domino sunt in tali amore, ex amore in omnibus fidei cognitionibus sunt, et ex amore in tali vita et luce intelligentiae ut vix aliquid describi possit. Vicissim 
autem spiritus qui in scientia doctrinalium fidei absque amore sunt, in tali frigida vita et obscura luce sunt ut ne quidem ad primum limen atrii caelorum approximare possint, quin retro fugiant: dicunt 
quidam se credidisse in Dominum, sed non vixerunt sicut docuit; de quibus Dominus ita apud Matthaeum, Non omnis dicens Mihi, Domine, Domine, intrabit in regnum caelorum, sed faciens voluntatem Meam: 
multi dicent Mihi in illa die, Domine, Domine, nonne per nomen tuum prophetavimus? et quae sequuntur, vii 21, 22 ad fin. Exinde constat quod qui in amore, etiam in fide sint, et sic in vita caelesti, 
non autem qui se dicunt esse in fide et non sunt in vita amoris. Vita fidei absque amore se habet sicut lux solis absque calore, ut in hieme, quando nihil crescit sed omnia et singula torpent et 
emoriuntur; sed fides ex amore se habet sicut lux solis tempore veris, quando omnia crescunt et florent, nam calor solis est qui producit; in spiritualibus et caelestibus similiter, quae solent repraesentari 
in Verbo per ea quae sunt in mundo et super terra: nulla fides, et fides absque amore, a Domino quoque comparatur hiemi, ubi de consummatione saeculi praedixit apud Marcum, Orate, ne fiat fuga 
vestra in hieme, erunt enim dies isti affectionis, xiii 18, 19; </p>
<p>'fuga' est ultimum tempus, etiam cujusvis hominis cum moritur; 'hiems' est vita nullius amoris; 'dies affectionis' est status ejus miserabilis 
in altera vita. </p>
