<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4825节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4825.</strong>“她复又生了一个儿子”表偶像崇拜。这从“儿子”的含义清楚可知，“儿子”在此是指偶像崇拜；因为在他之前出生的表示虚假与邪恶（<a href="4821.htm">4821</a>，<a href="4823.htm">4823</a>节）。由此可知三子表示偶像崇拜，因为虚假与邪恶这二者产生偶像崇拜，就包含在它里面。在犹大与迦南妇人所生的三个儿子当中，这个儿子是唯一存活下来的，犹太民族的三分之一就出自他。此处内义上的意思是，这个民族起源于偶像崇拜。这个民族非常倾向于偶像崇拜，这一点从圣言的历史和预言部分的字义明显看出来；从圣言的内义清楚可知，这个民族一直是偶像崇拜的民族。因为偶像崇拜不仅在于敬拜偶像、雕像和别神，还在于敬拜没有其内在的外在事物。这种偶像崇拜行为一直存在于这个民族当中，因为他们只崇敬外在事物，将内在事物完全抛在一边，甚至不想了解它们。诚然，他们拥有神圣事物，如放有约柜和施恩座的会幕，摆入陈设饼的桌子，灯台，焚香，会幕外献燔祭和祭物的祭坛。这一切都称为神圣，会幕的至内在部分被称为至圣所，以及圣所。他们当中还有亚伦和他们的大祭司所穿的衣服，称为圣衣；因为这些还包括乌陵和土明在其中的以弗得和胸牌，此外还有其它事物。然而，这些事物本身并不神圣，而是因代表神圣事物，也就是主国度的神性属天和属灵事物，以及主自己而神圣。这些事物更不是由于它们存在于其中的人民而神圣，因为这些人对被代表的内在事物根本没有情感，只对外在事物有情感；而唯独对外在事物有情感就是偶像崇拜。这就是敬拜木、石，以及包裹它们的金、银，这出于一种错觉，即：这些物体本身是神圣的。这就是该民族过去的性质，也是如今的性质。<br />然而，教会的代表仍能存在于他们当中，因为代表并不关注进行代表这个人，而是关注所代表的事物（参看<a href="665.htm">665</a>，<a href="1097.htm">1097</a>e，<a href="3670.htm">3670</a>，<a href="4208.htm">4208</a>，<a href="4281.htm">4281</a>，<a href="4288.htm">4288</a>节）。因此，他们的敬拜不会使他们在来世蒙福和幸福，只在世上繁荣兴旺，前提是他们坚持作代表，不转向外邦人的偶像，因而变成公开的偶像崇拜者。因为如果他们变成偶像崇拜者，那么这个民族便再也不能代表教会的任何事物。这些就是犹大和他的迦南妻子所生的第三个儿子所表示的偶像崇拜所指的事。该民族当中的这个偶像崇拜来源于他们的内在偶像崇拜，因为他们比其他民族更陷入自我之爱和尘世之爱（<a href="4459.htm">4459</a>e，<a href="4750.htm">4750</a>节）。那些陷入自我之爱和尘世之爱的人便陷入内在的偶像崇拜，因为他们敬拜自己和尘世，举行神圣仪式是为了自我崇拜和利益，也就是以自我为目的，而不是以主的教会和国度为目的，因而不是为了主。</p>

And she added again and bare a son. That this signifies what is idolatrous, is evident from the signification of a "son" here, as being what is idolatrous, for those who were born before signified falsity 
and evil (n. 4821, 4823). From this it follows that the third son means what is idolatrous, for both falsity and evil produce this, and are in it. Of the three sons who were born to Judah of the 
Canaanite woman, this son was the only one that survived, from whom came a third part of the Jewish nation; and that this nation took its rise from what is idolatrous, is here meant in the internal sense. 
That this nation was very prone to idolatry is evident from the historic and prophetic parts of the Word according to the sense of the letter; and that it was continually idolatrous is plain from 
the internal sense. For idolatry consists not only in worshiping idols, graven images, and other gods, but also in worshiping external things without their internals. In this that nation was continually 
idolatrous, adoring external things only, and entirely removing internal things, not being willing even to know about them. They had indeed holy things with them-as the tent of meeting, with the 
ark, the mercy-seat on it, the tables on which were the loaves, the lampstand, incenses, and the altar outside the tent, on which were offered burnt-offerings and sacrifices - all which things were called 
holy; and the inmost of the tent was called the holy of holies, and also the sanctuary. They also had with them the garments that belonged to Aaron and to their high priests, and were called the 
garments of holiness; for there was the ephod with the breast-plate in which was the Urim and Thummim, besides other things. Yet these things were not holy in themselves, but were holy from representing 
holy things, namely, the Divine celestial and spiritual things of the Lord's kingdom, and also the Lord Himself. Still less were they holy from the people with whom they were, for that people were 
not at all affected by the internal things which were represented, but only by the external; and to be affected by external things only is idolatrous, for it is to worship wood and stone, and also the 
gold and silver with which they are covered, from a phantasy that they are holy in themselves. Such was that nation, and such also it is at this day. [2] But still there might be with them a representative 
of a church, because the representative does not regard the person, but the thing (see n. 665, 1097e, 3670, 4208, 4281, 4288). Thus their worship did not make them blessed and happy in the other 
life, but only prosperous in the world so long as they continued in the representatives, and did not turn aside to the idols of the Gentiles, and thus become openly idolaters; for then not anything 
of the church could any longer be represented with that nation. These are the things which are meant by what is idolatrous that is signified by the third son of Judah by the Canaanite woman. This idolatry 
with that nation had its origin from their internal idolatry, for they above other nations were in the love of self and the world (n. 4459e, 4750); and those who are in the love of self and of the 
world are in internal idolatry, for they worship themselves and the world, and perform holy ceremonies for the sake of self-adoration and gain, that is, for self as an end-not for the Lord's church 
and kingdom as an end, thus not for the Lord. </p>

'And yet again she bore a son' means idolatry. This is clear from the meaning of 'a son' in this case as idolatry; for those born before him meant falsity and evil, <a href="4821.htm">4821</a>, <a href="4823.htm">4823</a>. From this it follows that 
the third son means idolatry, for these two - falsity and evil - lead to idolatry and are contained within it. Of the three born to Judah by the Canaanite this son was the only one to survive, a third 
of the Jewish nation being descended from him. The meaning in the internal sense at this point is that this nation sprang from idolatry. Its very strong inclination to idolatrous practice is clear 
from the historical and the prophetical parts - from the sense of the letter - of the Word; and from its internal sense it is evident that this nation was constantly an idolatrous one. For idolatry 
consists not only in the worship of idols and graven images, and also the worship of other gods, but even in the worship of external things devoid of internal ones. This kind of idolatrous practice existed 
constantly among that nation, for they revered external things alone and cast internal ones completely aside, and did not even wish to know about them. They indeed had holy things - such as the 
Tent of Meeting containing the Ark and the Mercy seat on this, the tables with the loaves on them, the lampstand, and incenses; and outside the Tent there was the altar on which they presented burnt offerings 
and sacrifices. All these things were called holy, while the inmost part there was called the Holy of Holies, as well as the Sanctuary. Also, there were the vestments they had which were worn 
by Aaron and their high priests, which were referred to as holy vestments, for these included the ephod and the breastplate where the Urim and Thummin were, besides much else. But these things were not 
inherently holy; they were holy because they were representative of holy things, that is to say, they were representative of the Divine celestial and spiritual things of the Lord's kingdom, and representative 
of the Lord Himself. Still less was the holiness of those things due to the people among whom they existed, for those people had no affection at all for the internal things that were represented, 
only for external ones; and having an affection for external things alone is idolatry. This involves the worship of wood and stone, and also of gold and silver covering these, from a delusion 
that those objects are inherently holy. This is what the nation was like then and is also like at the present day. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Yet a representative of the Church was nevertheless able to exist among such people 
because in that which is representative no attention is paid to the person who represents, only to whatever is represented, see <a href="665.htm">665</a>, <a href="1097.htm">1097</a> (end), <a href="3670.htm">3670</a>, <a href="4208.htm">4208</a>, <a href="4281.htm">4281</a>, <a href="4288.htm">4288</a>. Consequently their worship 
did not lead them to blessing and happiness in the next life, but merely to worldly prosperity, provided they adhered to those representatives and did not turn aside to the idols of the gentiles, and 
in so doing did not become openly idolatrous. For if they did it was no longer possible for that nation to represent anything at all of the Church. This then is what the idolatry, meant by Judah's third 
son by his Canaanite wife, is describing. This idolatry among that nation had its origin in internal idolatry, for more than all others this nation was governed by self-love and love of the world, <a href="4459.htm">4459</a> (end), <a href="4570.htm">4570</a>. Among those governed by self-love and love of the world internal idolatry exists, for they worship themselves and they worship the world. They pay attention to holy things for the 
sake of personal adoration and gain; that is, they have a selfish end in view, and do not have the Lord's Church and kingdom, and so the Lord Himself, in view. </p>

`Et addidit adhuc et peperit filium': quod significet idololatricum, constat (c)a significatione `filii' `hic quod' sit idololatricum, nam qui prius nati sunt, significabant falsum et malum, n. 4821, 
4823, inde sequitur quod tertius sit idololatricum; </p>
<p>utrumque enim, nempe falsum et malum, producit id {1} et inest ei.  Hic filius ex tribus natis Jehudae ex Canaanitide, solus superstes fuit, 
ex quo etiam tertia pars gentis Judaicae, quae quod [ab] idololatrico ortum duxerit, in sensu interno intelligitur; quod gens illa pronissima ad idololatriam fuerit, ex historicis et propheticis Verbi 
ex sensu ejus litterae constat, quod {2} continue idololatrica fuerit, ex sensu interno ibi patet; idololatricum enim non solum est colere idola et sculptilia, ut et colere alios deos, sed etiam 
est colere externa absque internis; in hac idololatria {3} fuerat gens illa continue; externa enim solum adorabat et interna prorsus removebat, et ne quidem de illis scire volebat; </p>
<p>habuit quidem 
apud se sancta, sicut tentorium conventus cum arca, et ibi propitiatorium, mensas super quibus panes, et candelabrum, et suffimenta, et extra tentorium {4} altare, super quo fiebant holocausta et 
sacrificia; quae omnia sancta vocabantur, ac intimum ibi sanctum sanctorum, ut et sanctuarium; erant etiam apud illo vestes quae Aharoni, et quae summis eorum sacerdotibus, quae vestes sanctitatis 
dictae sunt, erat enim ephodus cum pectorali ubi {5} urim et thummim, praeter plura; sed illa non erant sancta in se, sed sancta ex eo quod repraesentarent sancta, nempe Divina caelestia et spiritualia 
regni Domini, ac Ipsum Dominum; minus adhuc erant sancta a populo apud quem erant, nam ille nihil afficiebatur internis quae repraesentabantur sed solum externis, et affici solum externis est 
idololatricum; nam id est colere lignum et (o)lapidem, tum aurum et argentum quibus obducuntur {6}, ex phantasia quod sancta in se sint {7}; talis fuit gens illa, et talis etiam hodie est; sed usque 
apud tales potuit Ecclesiae repraesentativum esse quia repraesentativum non spectat personam sed rem, videatur n. 665, 1097 f, 3670, 4208, 4281, 4288; inde etiam cultus non illos beatos et felices 
fecit in altera vita sed solum prosperos in mundo, quamdiu perstabant in repraesentativis, nec declinabant ad gentium idola, et sic aperte idololatrae facti sunt, tunc enim non repraesentari aliquid 
Ecclesiae apud illam gentem amplius potuit; haec nunc sunt quae intelliguntur per idololatricum quod per tertium filium Jehudae ex muliere Canaanitide significatur.  Hoc idololatricum apud illam 
gentem originem duxerat {8} ab idololatrico interno ejus, fuerat enim in amore sui et mundi prae aliis gentibus, n. 4459 f, 4750; et qui in amore sui et mundi sunt, in idololatria interna {9} sunt, 
nam se colunt et mundum colunt, et sancta peragunt sui adorationis et sui lucri causa, {10} hoc est, propter finem sui, non propter finem Ecclesiae et regni Domini, ita non propter Dominum.
