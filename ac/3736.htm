<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3736节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3736.</strong>“使我平平安安地回到我父亲的家”表甚至到了完美融合的程度。这从以下事实清楚可知：当论及主时，“我父亲的家”是指神性本身，主通过实际成孕而在这神性里面；“回到那家”就是回到被称为“父”的神性良善本身。这神性良善就是“父”（<a href="3704.htm">3704</a>节）；显然，“回到那家”表示联结。当主说祂从父出来，来到这个世界，又要往父那里去时，这同样由主来表示。也就是说，祂从父出来表示神性本身披上人身；祂来到这个世界表示祂作为一个人；祂又要往父那里去表示祂要将人身本质与神性本质联结起来。这就是主在约翰福音中所说下列话的意思：<br />倘或你们看见人子升到祂原先所在之处。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.62.htm">6:62</a>）<br /><br />耶稣知道父已将万有交在祂手里，且知道自己是从神出来的，又要往神那里去，就对他们说，小子们，我还有一会儿同你们在一起；我所去的地方你们不能到。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.3.htm">13:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.33.htm">33</a>）<br /><br />现今我往差我来的那里去，你们没有人问我，你往哪里去？我去是与你们有益的；我若不去，保惠师就不到你们这里来；我若去，就差祂到你们这里来。一会儿你们就不得见我；再一会儿你们还要见我；因我往父那里去。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.5.htm">16:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.16.htm">16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.17.htm">17</a>）<br />又<br />我从父出来，到了世界；我又离开世界，往父那里去。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.28.htm">16:28</a>）<br />在这些经文中，“往父那里去”表将人身本质与神性本质联结起来。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3736</b></p><p><b>3736.</b>
And I return in peace to my father's house. That this signifies even to perfect union, is evident from the fact that the "house of my father," when predicated of the Lord, is the Divine Itself in which 
the Lord was from His very conception; and to "return to that house," is to return to the Divine good itself which is called the "Father." That this good is the "Father" may be seen above (n. 3704); 
and that to "return to that house" is to be united, is evident. The same was meant by the Lord when He said that He came forth from the Father and was come into the world, and that again He should go 
to the Father; that is to say, by coming forth from the Father" is meant that the Divine Itself assumed the Human; by "coming into the world," that He was as a man; and by His "going again to the Father," 
that He would unite the Human Essence to the Divine Essence. The same was meant also by these words of the Lord in John: </p>
<p>     If ye should see the Son of man ascending where He was before (John 
6:62). Again: </p>
<p>     Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He came forth from God, and went to God, said unto them, Children, yet a little while I am with you; 
whither I go ye cannot come (John 13:3, 33). Again: </p>
<p>     Now I go unto Him that sent Me; and none of you asketh Me, Whither goest Thou? It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away the 
Comforter will not come unto you; but if I go I will send Him unto you. A little while and ye shall not see Me; and again a little while and ye shall see Me; and because I go to the Father (John 16:5, 
7, 16-17). Again: </p>
<p>     I came out from the Father, and am come into the world; again I leave the world, and go to the Father (John 16:28). In these passages, to "go to the Father" is to unite the 
Human Essence to the Divine Essence. </p>

'And I come back in peace to my father's house' means even to the point of perfect union. This becomes clear from the fact that 'father's house', used in reference to the Lord, is the Divine itself which 
was the Lord's from actual conception. 'Coming back to that house' is resuming to Divine Good itself, which is called 'the Father' - Divine Good being 'the Father', see <a href="3704.htm">3704</a>. 'Coming back to that 
house' clearly means being united. The same was meant by the Lord when He said that He had come forth from the Father and had come into the world, and that He would be going again to the Father. That 
is to say, His coming forth from the Father means that the Divine itself had taken on the Human; His coming into the world means that He was as a human being; and His going again to the Father means 
that He would unite the Human Essence to the Divine Essence. This was the meaning of the following words spoken by the Lord in John, </p>
<blockquote>
What if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where He was 
before? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%206:62&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 6:62</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus knew that the Father had given all things into His hands and that He had come forth from God and was going to God. My children, yet a little while I 
am with you. Where I am going you cannot come. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2013:3,%2033&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 13:3, 33</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
Now I am going away to Him who sent Me; but none of you asks Me, Where are you going away? It is to your advantage 
that I go away, for if I did not go away the Paraclete would not come to you; but if I go away I will send Him to you. A little while, and you will not see Me, and again a little while, and you will 
see Me [because I am going away to the Father. Some of His disciples said to one another, What is this that He says to us, A little while, and you will not see Me, and again a little while, and you 
will see Me,] and, Because I am going away to the Father? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2016:-5,%207,%2010,%2016,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 16:-5, 7, 10, 16, 17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
I came forth from the Father and have come into the world; again, I am leaving the world 
and going to the Father. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2016:-28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 16:-28</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Going away to the Father' in these places means uniting the Human Essence to the Divine Essence. </p>

</p><b>3736.</b>
`Et rediero in pace ad domum patris mei': quod significet usque ad perfectam unionem, constare potest ex eo quod `domus patris' cum praedicatur de Domino, sit Ipsum Divinum, in Quo Dominus ab ipsa 
conceptione fuit; `redire ad illam domum' est ad ipsum Divinum Bonum quod `Pater' vocatur; quod id sit Pater, videatur n. 3704; `redire ad illam domum' quod sit uniri, constare potest: simile intellectum 
est a Domino, ubi dixit quod `exiverit a Patre, ac venerit in mundum,' et quod `rursus iret ad Patrem'; </p>
<p>nempe per `exiverit a Patre,' quod Ipsum Divinum assumpserit Humanum; per `venerit in 
mundum,' quod fuerit sicut homo; et per `iret ad Patrem,' quod univerit Essentiam Humanam Essentiae Divinae: hoc intellectum fuit per haec quae Dominus locutus apud Johannem,      Si videritis Filium 
hominis ascendentem ubi erat prius, vi 62: </p>
<p>apud eundem,      Scivit Jesus quod omnia dedisset Ipsi Pater in manus, et quod      a Deo exivisset, et ad Deum abiret; . . . filii, adhuc breve  
    vobiscum sum, . . . quo Ego abeo, vos non potestis venire,      xiii 3, 33: </p>
<p>apud eundem,      Nunc abeo ad Ipsum Qui misit Me, at nemo ex vobis (x)quaerit      Me, Quo abis? . . . prodest vobis, 
ut Ego abeam, si enim non      abirem, paracletus non veniret ad vos, si vero abivero, mittam      illum ad vos. . . . Pusillum cum non videbitis Me, et rursus      pusillum cum videbitis Me [quia 
Ego abeo ad Patrem. Dixerunt      ex discipulis Ipsius ad se invicem, Quid est quod dicit nobis?      Pusillum cum non videbitis Me, et rursus pusillum cum      videbitis Me], et (x)quia Ego abeo 
ad Patrem, xvi 5, 7, 10,      16, 17: </p>
<p>apud eundem,      Exivi a Patre, et veni in mundum; iterum relinquo mundum, et      vado ad Patrem, xvi 28; </p>
<p>`abire ad Patrem' est, in illis locis, Essentiam 
Humanam unire Essentiae Divinae. </p>
