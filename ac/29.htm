<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第29节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>29.</strong>创世记1:11-12 神说：“地要生出青草和结种子的草本，并结果子的树木，各从其类，果子都包着核。”事就这样成了。于是地生出了青草和结种子的草本，各从其类；并结果子的树木，各从其类；果子都包着核。神看着是好的。<br />当“地”，亦即人，已预备好从主接受属天的种子，以产生一定的良善与真理，主首先使柔嫩之物生出，这些被称为“青草”，然后使更有作用、能自我再生之物生出，即“结种子的草本”，最后使丰硕的良善之物生出，即“结果子的树木，果子都包着核”，且“各从其类”。<br />在重生之初，人以为他所行的良善和所说的真理都是出于自己，而事实上，一切良善和真理都是出于主。人若以为这些是出于自己，即表示他尚不具备真信的活力（虽然他以后可能接受之），还无法相信这些是出于主，因为他尚在预备当中，以待将来接受信的活力。该阶段用不具生命之物来象征，接下来具备信之活力的阶段则用活物来象征。<br />主是撒种之人，“种”是他的道，“地”是人，正如他自己所设的比喻（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.19.htm">13:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.23.htm">23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.37.htm">37</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.38.htm">38</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.39.htm">39</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可4.14.htm">4:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可4.20.htm">20</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.11.htm">8:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.15.htm">15</a>），类似地，他说：“神的国，如同人把种撒在地上，黑夜睡觉，白日起来，这种就发芽渐长，那人却不晓得如何这样。地生五谷，是出于自然的。先发苗，后长穗，再后穗上结成饱满的子粒。”（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可4.26.htm">4:26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可4.27.htm">27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可4.28.htm">28</a>）<br />笼统而言，“神的国”表整个天堂，其次，它表主的真教会。具体而言，它表每个具备真信之人，亦即因活出信而得重生之人。此等人皆可称为一个“天堂”，因为天堂在其内，也可称为“神的国”，因为神的国在其内，正如主教导说：法利赛人问：“神的国几时来到？”耶稣回答说：“神的国来到，不是眼所能见的，人也不得说，‘看哪，在这里’，‘看哪，在那里’，因为神的国就在你们心里。”（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路17.20.htm">17:20</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路17.21.htm">21</a>）<br />这是重生的第三个阶段，是人悔改的阶段，同样是从黑暗转入光明，从晚上转入早晨。故经上说：“有晚上，有早晨，是第三日。”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创1.13.htm">1:13</a>）</p>

And God said, "Let the earth cause the sprouting on the earth of the tender plant, of the plant bearing its seed, of the fruit tree making the fruit that holds its seed, each in the way of its kind;" and so it was done. And the earth produced the tender plant, the plant bearing its seed in the way of its kind, and the tree making the fruit that held its seed in the way of its kind. And God saw that it was good.<br />When the earth (a person) is so well prepared as to be able to accept heavenly seed from the Lord and to produce good and truth in some degree, that is the time when the Lord first causes the sprouting of something tender, called the tender plant or grass. Next he stimulates something more useful that reseeds itself — the plant bearing its seed. Finally he germinates something good, which reproduces fruitfully — the tree making the fruit that holds its seed, each of these in the way of its kind.<br />During regeneration we naturally suppose at first that the good we do and the truth we speak come from ourselves, when the reality is that all good and truth come from the Lord. If we imagine they come from ourselves, then, we are not yet in possession of the life force belonging to true faith (although we can receive it later). We cannot believe yet that they come from the Lord, because we are being prepared to receive the living power of faith. This stage is represented in the story by things that have no living soul; animate creatures represent the stage of living faith to come.<br />[2] The Lord is the sower of seeds, the seed is his Word, and the earth is the human being, as he saw fit to say in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_29/bible_king-james-version_matthew_13_19-23" target=_top>Matthew 13:19-23</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_29/bible_king-james-version_matthew_13_37-38" target=_top>37-38</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_29/bible_king-james-version_matthew_13_39" target=_top>39</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_29/bible_king-james-version_mark_4_14-20" target=_top>Mark 4:14-20</a>; and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_29/bible_king-james-version_luke_8_11-15" target=_top>Luke 8:11-15</a>. A similar description:<br />So God's kingdom is like one who tosses seed into the earth and sleeps and rises night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows; how it happens, the person does not know. For the earth bears fruit readily — first a shoot, then an ear, then the full grain in the ear. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_29/bible_king-james-version_mark_4_26-27" target=_top>Mark 4:26-27</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_29/bible_king-james-version_mark_4_28" target=_top>28</a>)<br />"God's kingdom" in its broadest sense means the whole of heaven. Less broadly it means the Lord's true church. In its narrow sense it refers to everyone with true faith, which is to say, all who become reborn by living out their faith. Each of these people is also called a heaven (since they have heaven in them) and God's kingdom (since they have God's kingdom in them). The Lord himself teaches this in Luke:<br />Jesus was asked by the Pharisees, "When is God's kingdom coming?" He answered them and said, "God's kingdom does not come in an observable way, nor will they say, ‘Look here!' or ‘Look there!' because — look! — God's kingdom is within you." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_29/bible_king-james-version_luke_17_20-21" target=_top>Luke 17:20-21</a>)<br />This is the third step in our regeneration and the stage at which we repent. The process continues to advance from shadow to light, from evening to morning, and so it says:<br />[3] <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_29/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_13" target=_top>Genesis 1:13</a>. And there was evening and there was morning, the third day. </p>

Verses 11, 12. And God said, Let the earth bring forth the tender herb, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree bearing fruit after its kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth; and it was so. 
And the earth brought forth the tender herb, the herb yielding seed after its kind, and the tree bearing fruit, whose seed was in itself, after its kind; and God saw that it was good. When the "earth" 
or man, has been thus prepared to receive celestial seeds from the Lord, and to produce something of what is good and true, then the Lord first causes some tender thing to spring forth, which is called 
the "tender herb;" then something more useful, which again bears seed in itself, and is called the "herb yielding seed;" and at length something good which becomes fruitful, and is called the "tree 
bearing fruit, whose seed is in itself" each according to its own kind. The man who is being regenerated is at first of such a quality that he supposes the good which he does, and the truth which he 
speaks, to be from himself, when in reality all good and all truth are from the Lord, so that whosoever supposes them to be from himself has not as yet the life of true faith, which nevertheless he 
may afterwards receive; for he cannot as yet believe that they are from the Lord, because he is only in a state of preparation for the reception of the life of faith. This state is here represented by 
things inanimate, and the succeeding one of the life of faith, by animate things. [2] The Lord is He who sows, the "seed" is His Word, and the "earth" is man, as He himself has deigned to declare (Matt. 
13:19-24, 37-39; Mark 4:14-21; Luke 8:11-16). To the same purport He gives this description: </p>
<p>     So is the kingdom of God, as a man when he casteth seed into the earth, and sleepeth and riseth night 
and day, and the seed groweth and riseth up, he knoweth not how; for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself, first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear (Mark 4:26-28). By 
the "kingdom of God" in the universal sense, is meant the universal heaven; in a sense less universal, the true church of the Lord; and in a particular sense, everyone who is of true faith, or who 
is regenerate by a life of faith. Wherefore such a person is also called "heaven" because heaven is in him; and likewise the "kingdom of God" because the kingdom of God is in him as the Lord Himself 
teaches in Luke: </p>
<p>     Being demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come, He answered them, and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation; neither shall they say, Lo here! 
or, Lo there! for behold, the kingdom of God is within you (Luke 17:20-21). This is the third successive stage of the regeneration of man, being his state of repentance, and in like manner proceeding 
from shade to light, or from evening to morning; wherefore it is said (verse 13), "and the evening and the morning were the third day." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 29</b></p><p><b>29.</b>
Verses 11, 12 And God said, Let the earth cause tender plants to spring up, seed-bearing plants, fruit trees bearing fruit, each according to its kind, in which is its seed, upon the earth; and it was 
so. And the earth brought forth tender herbs, seed-bearing plants, each according to its kind, and trees bearing fruit, in which is their seed, each according to its kind; and God saw that it was good. 
 </p>
<p>Once the earth or the individual has been made ready in such a way that he can receive from the Lord heavenly seeds and produce some measure of good and truth, the Lord first of all causes something 
tender to spring up, which is: called 'a tender plant', then something more useful which reproduces itself and is called 'a seed-bearing plant', and finally something good which bears fruit and 
is called 'a tree bearing fruit' in which is its seed, 'each one according to its kind'. The person who is being regenerated is at first such as imagines that any good he does comes from himself, and 
that any truth he utters comes from himself; but the fact of the matter is that all good and all truth come from the Lord. Consequently anyone who imagines that these originate in himself does not as 
yet have the life that belongs to true faith, though he is able to receive it later on. Indeed he is not yet able to believe that they come from the Lord because his state is one of preparation for receiving 
the life inherent in faith. That state is represented in these verses by plant life, the subsequent state, when the life inherent in faith is present, by living creatures.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The Lord Himself 
saw fit to tell us that He is 'the sower', that 'the seed' is His Word, and that 'the earth' is man, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:19-24,%2037-39&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13:19-24, 37-39</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%204:14-21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 4:14-21</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%208:11-16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 8:11-16</a>. He describes the matter again in a similar 
way,  </p>
<blockquote>
The kingdom of God is like a man casting seed into the ground, and sleeping and rising night and day, and the seed sprouts and springs up, he knows not how; for the earth bears fruit of itself, 
first the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%204:26-28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 4:26-28</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the universal sense, 'the kingdom of God' is used to mean the whole of heaven, in the less universal sense the Lord's 
true Church, and in particular every individual who has true faith, that is, who has been regenerated by means of the life that inheres in faith. For that reason the individual is also called 'heaven', 
for heaven is within him, and 'the kingdom of God', since that too is within him. This the Lord Himself teaches through Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus was asked by the Pharisees, When is the kingdom of God coming? 
He answered them and said, The kingdom of God is not coming with observation, nor will people say, Behold, here it is! or, Behold, there! for behold, the kingdom of God is within you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2017:20,%2021&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 17:20, 21</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This is the third stage of a person's regeneration, a state when he is repentant. It is like passing from shadow into the light, or from evening to morning, and this is why it is said in Verse 
13, And there was evening, and there was morning, a third day.  </p>

Vers. 11, 12.  Et dixit Deus, Progerminare faciat terra herbam teneram, herbam seminificantem semen, arborem fructui facientem fructum, secundum speciem suam, in quo semen ejus, super terra; et factum 
ita. Et produxit terra herbam teneram, herbam seminificantem semen, secundum speciem suam, et arborem facientem fructum, in quo semen ejus, secundum speciem suam; et vidit Deus quod bonum. Cum terra 
sic praeparata est, seu homo, ut a Domino recipere possit semina caelestia et producere aliquid boni et veri, tunc Dominus primum progerminare facit teneram quoddam, quod vocatur 'herba tenera'; tum 
aliquid utilius, quod rursus se proseminat, et vocatur 'herba seminificans semen'; tandem aliquod bonum quod se fructificat, et vocatur 'arbor faciens fructum, in quo semen ejus,' quodlibet secundum 
speciem suam. Homo qui regeneratur, primum talis est ut putet bonum quod facit, esse ex semet, et verum quod dicit, esse ex semet, cum tamen ita se res habet quod omne bonum et omne verum sit a Domino, 
quare qui putat esse a semet, is nondum habet vitam verae fidei, quam tamen postmodum recipere potest; nondum enim credere potest quod a Domino, quia in statu praeparationis ad recipiendam vitam fidei 
est; status iste repraesentatur hic per inanimata; et status vitae fidei postmodum per animata.  [2] Quod Dominus sit 'seminans,' 'semen' sit Verbum Ipsius, et quod 'terra' homo, Ipse dignatus est 
dicere, Matth. xiii 19-24, 37-39; Marc. iv 14-21; Luc. via.11-16.  Describit etiam similiter, 		Ita est regnum Dei, ut homo, dum jacit {1} semen in terram, et dormit et surgit nocte et die; et semen 
germinat et assurgit, quomodo is nescit, sponte enim terra fructum fert, primum herbam, dein spicam, deinde plenum frumentum in spica, Marc. iv 26-28. Per 'regnum Dei' in universali sensu intelligitur 
universum caelum; in minus universali Ecclesia vera Domini; in particulari unusquisque qui est verae fidei, seu per fidei vitam regeneratus, quare is quoque vocatur 'caelum' quia in illo est caelum, 
tum regnum Dei quia in illo est regnum Dei, quod Ipse Dominus docet per Lucam, 	 	Jesus interrogatus a Pharisaeis, Quando venit regnum Dei? respondit iis, et dixit, Non venit regnum Dei cum observatione, 
neque dicent, Ecce hic, aut, Ecce illic; ecce enim regnum Dei intra vos est, xvii 20, 21. Hoc tertium successivum est regenerationis hominis, et status ejus paenitentiae, similiter ab umbra procedens 
ad lucem, seu a vespera ad mane, quare dicitur, vers. 13, Et fuit vespera, et fuit mane, dies tertius. @	1 jacet 1.$
