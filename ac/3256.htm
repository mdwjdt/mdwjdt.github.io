<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3256节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3256.</strong>“他儿子以撒、以实玛利把他埋葬”表主的代表现由以撒和以实玛利来接手。这从“埋葬”的含义清楚可知，“埋葬”是指复活和兴起，如前所示（<a href="2916.htm">2916</a>节）。由于此处论述的是就该状态走向终结而言，通过亚伯拉罕来表现的主的代表，以及通过以撒和以实玛利来表现的代表现在开始了，故“埋葬”在此表示这状态的兴起。具有属灵之义的词语，其确切含义取决于它们所论及的事物。至于圣言中的代表，情况是这样：它们是连续不断的，即使它们看似因那些所代表之人的死亡而中断。然而，他们的死亡并不意味着任何中断，而意味着延续；因此，他们的埋葬表示代表在某个其他人身上再度兴起并延续。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3256</b></p><p><b>3256.</b>
And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him. That this signifies that the representation of the Lord is now taken up by Isaac and Ishmael, can be seen from the signification of "burying." (That being "buried" 
denotes to be resuscitated and to rise again, was shown above, n. 2916.) As the representation of the Lord by Abraham is here treated of, as regards this state having come to an end, and that 
now the representation by Isaac and Ishmael begins, therefore by "burying" in this case is signified the resuscitation of this state; for the significations are determined in accordance with their application 
to the things of which they are predicated. The case with the representatives in the Word is that they are continuous, although they appear as if interrupted by the deaths of those who represent; 
their deaths however do not signify any interruption, but a continuation; and therefore their burials signify that the representative is resuscitated and continued in someone else. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3256</b></p><p><b>3256.</b>
'And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him' means that the representation of the Lord was now taken over by Isaac and Ishmael. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'burying', namely being raised up 
and rising again, as shown in <a href="2916.htm">2916</a>, <a href="2917.htm">2917</a>. The subject being that state where the representation of the Lord portrayed by means of Abraham came to an end, and the representation portrayed by Isaac and 
Ishmael now begins, 'burying' therefore means here the rise of that state. Phrases that carry a spiritual meaning depend for their exact meaning on the things to which they refer. With regard to representatives 
in the Word, they are continuous even though they seem to be broken off by the deaths of those who have played representative roles. Their deaths however do not mean any breaking off but a 
continuation, and therefore even their burial means that the representation was raised up again and continued in someone else. </p>

</p><b>3256.</b>
`Et sepeliverunt eum Jishak et Jishmael filii ejus': quod significet quod exciperet nunc repraesentativum Domini per Jishakum et Jishmaelem, constare potest a significatione `sepelire'; quod `sepeliri' 
sit resuscitari et resurgere, n. 2916, 2917 ostensum est: hic quia actum est de repraesentatione Domini per Abrahamum, quod ille status finem habuerit, et nunc incipiat repraesentatio per Jishakum 
et Jishmaelem, idcirco per `sepelire' hic significatur resuscitatio illius status; se habent significationes applicate ad illa de quibus praedicantur. Cum repraesentativis in Verbo ita se habet, quod 
continua sint, tametsi apparent interrupta per mortes illorum qui repraesentarunt; at mortes (c)eorum non aliquam interruptionem significant, sed continuationem; ideo etiam sepulturae illorum significant 
repraesentativum in alio resuscitatum et {1}continuatum. @1 i sic$  </p>
