<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9234节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9234.</strong>被另一个背着的这一个被放下来，走到我跟前，把自己置于我的左胳膊肘下面。他从那个位置说话，说：每当他们发出声音时，就这样打雷；以此恐吓那些想要伤害他们的灵人；其中一些灵人就被他们吓跑了；这使他们能安全地去往他们想去的任何地方。为叫我确切地知道他们所制造的声音具有这种性质，这个灵人便离开我到其他一些灵人那里，但也不是完全看不见，然后以同样的方式发出雷鸣般的响声。此外，他们还向我展示了他们的声音从腹部发出，就像打嗝，以制造这种响亮的雷鸣声。</p>

The one who was borne by the other, upon being set down, came to me, applying himself to my left side below my elbow. From that position he spoke, saying that when they utter their voice, they thunder 
in this manner, and thereby terrify those spirits who wish to do them harm; and some they put to flight; thus being able to go in safety wherever they wish. That I might know of a certainty that they 
made such a sound, he went away from me to some others, but not quite out of sight, and thundered in the same way. And they further showed to me how their voice, sent forth from the abdomen like a belching 
forth, made this loud thundering noise. </p>

The one carried by the other was let down and came to me, positioning himself on my left beneath the elbow. From there he spoke, saying that they boom in that way like thunder when they use their voices. 
By doing this they frighten spirits who wish to do them harm, some of whom they put to flight; and this enables them to go in safety wherever they wish. So that I might know for certain that the 
sound they made was of such a nature, that spirit went away from me to some others, though not completely out of sight, and boomed in a similar way. They went on to show me that their voice came up from 
the abdomen, like belching, to produce that booming sound.  </p>

Qui portatus ab {1}altero, demissus veniebat ad me, se applicans sinistro lateri sub ulna, et inde loquebatur, dicens quod cum vocem edunt, ita tonent, et quod sic spiritus qui illis malum inferre volunt, 
territent, et quosdam in fugam agant, et quod {2}ita tuti vadant quo {3}volunt. Ut pro certo scirem quod talis (c)illorum sonus esset, recedebat ille a me ad quosdam alios, sed non plane extra 
conspectum, et similiter {4}tonabat.  Et porro ostendebant quod vox eorum ex abdomine emissa ad instar eructationis ita intonaret. @1 alio$ @2 sic$ @3 velint$ @4 tonabant$ </p>
