<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5157节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5157.</strong>“必有飞鸟来吃你身上的肉”表源于邪恶的虚假将毁灭这些感官印象的每一个。这从“吃”、“飞鸟”、“肉”和“你身上”的含义清楚可知：“吃”是指毁灭，如前所述（<a href="5149.htm">5149</a>节）；“飞鸟”是指虚假，也如前所述（<a href="5149.htm">5149</a>节）；“肉”是指良善（参看<a href="3812.htm">3812</a>，<a href="3813.htm">3813</a>节），因而在反面意义上是指邪恶（因为在圣言中，绝大多数事物也具有一个反面意义，这从它们在正面意义上的含义可知）；“你身上”是指从受意愿部分支配的感官印象那里，因为这些感官印象由“膳长”来代表（<a href="5078.htm">5078</a>，<a href="5082.htm">5082</a>节）。这些是邪恶，故被抛弃，这一事实从前文明显看出来。<br />这一切的含义，即：“酒政”所代表的受理解力部分支配的感官印象被保留下来，而“膳长”所代表的受意愿部分支配的感官印象却被抛弃，是一个若无光照就完全无法理解的奥秘。不过，接下来的内容有助于阐明这个奥秘。感官印象是指那些通过五种外在或身体感官被引入人的记忆和欲望的记忆知识和快乐，它们一起构成外层属世层，人凭这外层属世层而被称为感官人。这些记忆知识受其心智的理解力部分支配，而快乐受意愿部分支配。而且，记忆知识与属于理解力的真理有关，快乐与属于意愿的良善有关。前者由“酒政”来代表，被保留下来；后者由“膳长”来代表，被抛弃了。<br />这些记忆知识之所以被保留下来，是因为它们有一段时间能与理解力中的观念一致；而快乐之所以被抛弃，是因为它们绝无可能与意愿里的东西一致。因为主里面的意愿部分（就至高意义而言，此处论述的主题就是主）是成孕而来的神性，是神性良善本身；而祂通过出生从母亲那里所得来的意愿部分是邪恶，因而必须被抛弃；取而代之的是，一个新意愿必须通过神性理解力从神性意愿那里获得，也就是说，通过神性真理从神性良善那里获得，因而凭祂自己的能力获得。这就是此处在内义上所描述的奥秘。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5157</b></p><p><b>5157.</b>
And the bird shall eat thy flesh from upon thee. That this signifies that the falsity of evil will consume what is of these sensuous things, is evident from the signification of "eating," as being to 
consume (of which above, n. 5149); and from the signification of "bird," as being falsity (of which also above, n. 5149); and from the signification of "flesh," as being good (see n. 3812, 3813), and 
hence in the opposite sense evil; for most of the expressions in the Word have also an opposite sense, which is known from their signification in the genuine sense; and from the signification of "from 
upon thee," as being from the sensuous things subject to the will part, for these are represented by the baker (n. 5078, 5082). That these were evil, and therefore to be rejected, is evident from what 
goes before.  [2] How the case is in regard to this-that the sensuous things subject to the intellectual part, which are represented by the butler, were retained, and that the sensuous things subject 
to the will part, which are represented by the baker, were rejected-is a secret that without enlightenment cannot be comprehended, but what follows may help to throw light upon it. By sensuous things 
are meant those memory-knowledges and those delights which have been instilled through the five external or bodily senses into man's memory and into his desires, and which together constitute the 
exterior natural, from which a man is called a sensuous man. These memory-knowledges are subject to the intellectual part, but the delights are subject to the will part; the memory-knowledges also bear 
relation to the truths which are of the understanding, and the delights to the goods which are of the will; the former are what are represented by the butler and were retained, and the latter are what 
are represented by the baker and were rejected. [3] The reason why the former were retained is that for a time they could agree with intellectual things; and the reason why the latter were rejected 
is that they could not possibly agree. For the will part in the Lord (who is the subject here treated of in the supreme internal sense) was Divine from conception, and was the Divine good itself; but 
the will part that He had by birth from the mother was evil; and therefore this was to be rejected, and in its place a new one was to be procured from the Divine will part by means of the intellectual, 
or from the Divine good by means of the Divine truth, thus from His own power. This is the secret that is here described in the internal sense. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5157</b></p><p><b>5157.</b>
'And the birds will eat your flesh from upon you' means that falsity originating in evil will consume every one of those sensory impressions. This is clear from the meaning of 'eating' as consuming, 
dealt with above in <a href="5149.htm">5149</a>; from the meaning of 'the birds' as falsity, also dealt with above in <a href="5149.htm">5149</a>; from the meaning of 'flesh' as good, dealt with in <a href="3812.htm">3812</a>, <a href="3813.htm">3813</a>, and therefore in the contrary sense 
as evil (for most things in the Word also have a contrary sense, which is discerned from their meaning in the genuine sense); and from the meaning of 'from upon you as from the sensory impressions subject 
to the will part, since those impressions are represented by 'the baker', <a href="5078.htm">5078</a>, <a href="5082.htm">5082</a>. The fact that these were evil and had therefore to be cast aside is clear from what has gone before. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The 
significance of all this - that the sensory impressions subject to the understanding part, which are represented by 'the cupbearer', were retained, whereas those subject to the will part, which are 
represented by 'the baker', were cast aside - is an arcanum that is completely unintelligible unless it has light shed on it. Let the following serve to shed some such light. By sensory impressions are 
meant those known facts and those delights which have been introduced through the five external or bodily senses into a person's memory and into his longings, and which together constitute the exterior 
natural, by virtue of which a person is called one governed by the senses. The facts are subject to the understanding part of his mind, whereas the delights are subject to the will part. Also, the 
facts link up with the truths which belong to the understanding, while the delights link up with the forms of good which belong to the will. The former are represented by 'the cupbearer' and were retained, 
but the latter are represented by 'the baker' and were cast aside. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The reason those known facts were retained is that in time they were able to accord with ideas in the understanding; but 
the reason the delights were cast aside is that they were by no means able to accord with what was in the will. For the will within the Lord, who is the subject in the highest internal sense, was from 
conception Divine and was the Divine Good itself; but the will received through His birth from His mother was evil and therefore had to be cast aside, and a new will had to be acquired in place of 
it. This new will was to be acquired from the Divine Will through the [Divine] Understanding, that is, from Divine Good through Divine Truth, and so was acquired by His own power. This is the arcanum 
which is described here in the internal sense. </p>

</p><b>5157.</b>
`Et edet avis carnem tuam e super te': quod significet quod falsum mali consumet illa quae sunt istorum sensualium, constat ex significatione `edere' quod sit consumere, de qua supra n. 5149; ex significatione 
`avis' quod sit falsum, de qua etiam supra n. 5149; </p>
<p>ex significatione `carnis' quod sit bonum, de qua n. 3812, 3813, inde in opposito sensu malum; pleraque in Verbo etiam oppositum sensum 
habent, qui cognoscitur ex significatione eorum in sensu genuino; et ex significatione `[e] super te', quod sit ex sensualibus parti voluntariae subjectis, nam haec per `pistorem' repraesentantur, 
n. 5078, 5082, quae quod mala fuerint, et ideo rejicienda, ex illis quae praecedunt, constat.  [2] Quomodo cum his se habet, nempe quod sensualia parti intellectuali subjecta quae per `pincernam' 
repraesentantur, retenta fuerint, et quod sensualia parti voluntariae subjecta quae per `pistorem' repraesentantur, rejecta fuerint, est arcanum quod absque illustratione non comprehendi potest; 
sint autem alicui elucidationi haec: per sensualia intelliguntur illa scientifica et illa jucunda quae insinuata sunt per quinque sensus externos seu corporis, in hominis memoriam et in ejus concupiscentias, 
et quae simul constituunt naturale exterius, ex quo homo appellatur homo sensualis; </p>
<p>scientifica illa subjecta sunt parti intellectuali, at jucunda parti voluntariae, se quoque scientifica 
illa referunt ad vera quae intellectus, et jucunda illa ad bona quae voluntatis; illa sunt quae per `pincernam' repraesentantur et retenta sunt, haec autem quae per `pistorem' et rejecta sunt; 
quod illa retenta fuerint, est quia ad tempus concordare potuerunt 3 cum intellectualibus, at quod haec rejecta fuerint, est quia nullatenus concordare potuerunt cum voluntario; voluntarium enim in 
Domino, de Quo {1} sensu interno supremo agitur, a conceptione fuit Divinum, et fuit ipsum Divinum Bonum, voluntarium autem per nativitatem a matre fuit malum, quapropter hoc rejiciendum erat, et 
novum loco ejus comparandum ex Divino Voluntario per Intellectuale, seu ex Divino Bono per Divinum Verum, ita ex propria potentia; hoc arcanum est quod in sensu interno hic describitur. @1 i hic$ </p>
