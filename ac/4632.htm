<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4632节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4632.</strong>有一次，当我正思想灵魂在身体里面的统治，以及意愿进入行为的流注时，注意到那些在粪便地狱的人（当时，这地狱稍微打开一会儿）却只想着灵魂对肛门的控制，以及意愿进入粪便排泄的流注。这表明他们的觉知在那地狱制造了哪种气场，以及它所产生的恶臭。当我正思想婚姻之爱时，类似的事也发生了。在这种情况下，那些在奸淫者的地狱之人只在脑子里反复思想那种与奸淫有关的淫秽做法和可耻行径。当我正思想诚实时，注意到骗子们却只想着欺骗的罪行</p>

Once when I was thinking about the rule of the soul in the body, and about the influx of the will into the actions, I noticed that those who are in an excrementitious hell that was then a little open, 
thought of nothing but the control of the soul over the anus, and of the influx of the will into the protrusion of the excrements, which showed in what kind of a sphere of perception and thence of stench 
they were. A similar thing took place when I was thinking about conjugial love, in that those who are in the hell of adulterers then thought of nothing but filthy practices and infamous acts such 
as are connected with adultery. And when I thought about sincerity, I noticed that the deceitful thought of nothing but deceitful crimes. </p>

On one occasion when I was thinking about the government of the soul within the body and about the influx of the will into actions, I noticed that those in the hell of excrement, which at that time had 
been opened for a short while, thought about nothing else than the soul's control of the anus and about the influx of the will into the voidings of excrement from there. This revealed the kind of sphere 
created by their perception in that hell and the stink produced by it. Something similar happened when I was thinking about conjugial love. In this case those in the hell where adulterers live were 
turning over in their minds nothing else than the kind of shameful acts and nasty practices that go with adultery. And when I was thinking about honesty, those given to deceit thought of nothing else 
but committing what was criminal by fraud. </p>

</p><b>4632.</b>
Cum quondam cogitarem de regimine animae in corpore, (c)et de influxu voluntatis in actiones, apperceptum quod illi qui in interno excrementitio tunc parumper aperto essent, non aliud cogitarent quam 
de animae imperio in anum, et de influxu voluntatis in protrusiones excrementorum; inde patuit in quali perceptionis et inde fetoris sphaera essent.  Similiter factum cum de amore conjugiali cogitarem, 
quod tunc illi qui in inferno ubi adulteri, nihil nisi quam flagitiosa qualia sunt adulterii et spurca volverent.  Et cum de sinceritate, quod illi qui in dolo, nihil nisi facinorosum ex dolo 
cogitarent{1}.      @1 i et sic porro$ </p>
