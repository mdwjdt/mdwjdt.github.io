<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4772节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4772.</strong>“人就把它带到他们父亲那里”表与古教会和初代（基督）教会的良善和真理相比。这从雅各的代表清楚可知，雅各，就是此处的“父亲”是指古教会（<a href="4680.htm">4680</a>，<a href="4700.htm">4700</a>节），也是指初代教会，也就是起初的基督教会，如下文所述。把外衣带到该教会在内义上表示把被歪曲的良善与真理和纯正教会的良善与真理进行比较。雅各在此之所以不仅代表古教会，还代表初代教会，也就是起初的基督教会，是因为这二者就内在而言完全相同，就外在而言则彼此不同。古教会的外在就是主及其国度的属天和属灵之物的一切代表，因而是构成基督教会的那类事物。因此，当古教会以及犹太教会的外在被打开，可以说从存在于它们里面的东西被剥离出来时，基督教会就显露了出来。这一点也由裂为两半的殿里的幔子来表示（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太27.51.htm">27:51</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可15.38.htm">15:38</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路23.45.htm">23:45</a>）。正因如此，“他们父亲”雅各不仅代表古教会，还代表初代基督教会。</p>

And they brought it to their father. That this signifies comparison with the goods and truths of the Ancient and the Primitive Church, is evident from the representation of Jacob, who here is the "father," 
as being the Ancient Church (n. 4680, 4700), and also the Primitive Church, that is, the Christian Church in its beginning, of which hereafter. To bring such a tunic to this church, is in the internal 
sense to institute a comparison of falsified goods and truths with the goods and truths of the genuine church. That by Jacob is here represented not only the Ancient, but also the Primitive Church, 
that is, the Christian Church in its beginning, is because these are altogether the same as to internals, and differ only in externals. The externals of the Ancient Church were all representative 
of the Lord and of the celestial and spiritual things of His kingdom, that is, of love and charity and the faith thence derived, consequently of such things as are of the Christian Church. Thus when 
the externals of the Ancient, and also of the Jewish Church, are unfolded and as it were unwrapped, the Christian Church is disclosed. This was signified also by the veil of the temple being rent asunder 
(Matt. 27:51; Mark 15:38; Luke 23:45). It is for this reason that by Jacob the father is represented not only the Ancient, but also the Primitive Christian Church. </p>

'And brought it to their father' means comparison with the goods and truths of the Ancient Church and of the Primitive [Christian] one. This is clear from the representation of Jacob, to whom 'father' 
refers here, as the Ancient Church, dealt with in <a href="4680.htm">4680</a>, <a href="4700.htm">4700</a>, and also the Primitive Church, that is, the Christian Church when it first began, dealt with below. 'Bringing the tunic' in the condition 
in which it now was to the Church means in the internal sense bringing about a comparison of falsified goods and truths with the genuine goods and truths of the Church.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> The reason Jacob here represents 
not only the Ancient Church but also the Primitive one - that is, the Christian Church when it first began - is that the two are exactly alike so far as internal features are concerned and differ 
from each other only so far as external ones are concerned. The external features of the Ancient Church consisted of all the representatives of the Lord and of the celestial and spiritual realities of 
His kingdom, which are love and charity, and faith derived from these, and so the kinds of things that constitute the Christian Church. When therefore the external features of the Ancient Church, and 
also of the Jewish, are opened out and are so to speak stripped away from what is present within them, the Christian Church is laid bare. This was also meant by the veil in the Temple being torn apart,

This explains why Jacob 'their father' represents not only the Ancient Church but also the Primitive Christian one.

had in his rough draft and appears in the third Latin edition. The words used in the first and second Latin editions mean the goods and truths of the genuine Church. </p>

`Et adduxerunt ad patrem illorum': quod significet collationem cum bonis et veris Ecclesiae Antiquae et Primitivae, constat a repraesentatione `Jacobi' qui hic est `pater' quod sit Ecclesia Antiqua, 
de qua n. 4680, 4700, et quoque Ecclesia Primitiva, hoc est, Ecclesia Christiana {1} in suo initio, de qua sequitur; `adducere tunicam talem' ad illam in sensu interno est instituere collationem 
falsificatorum bonorum et verorum cum bonis et veris genuinis {2} Ecclesiae.  Quod per `Jacobum' repraesentetur hic non modo Ecclesia Antiqua, sed etiam Primitiva, hoc est, Christiana in suo initio, 
est quia prorsus eaedem sunt quoad interna, sed modo discrepunt {3} quoad externa; externa Ecclesiae Antiquae fuerunt omnia repraesentativa Domini ac caelestium et spiritualium regni Ipsius, hoc 
est, amoris et charitatis et inde fidei, proinde talium quae sunt Ecclesiae Christianae; inde est cum evolvuntur et quasi exfasciantur externa quae fuerunt Antiquae Ecclesiae, et quoque Judaicae, 
quod pateat Ecclesia Christiana; hoc significatum etiam est per `quod velum in Templo disruptum sit', Matth. xxvii 51; Marc. xv 38 {4}; Luc. xxiii 45; inde est quod per `Jacobum patrem' repraesentetur 
non modo Ecclesia Antiqua, sed etiam Primitiva Christiana.      @1 i qualis fuit$      @2 genuinae I$      @3 discrepent I$      @4 After Luke reference.$ </p>
