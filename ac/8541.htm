<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8541节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">木星的灵人和居民-续</h4><br />8541.关于他们的神性敬拜，最重要的一点是：他们承认我们的主是至高者，统治天与地；他们称祂为独一主。他们活在肉身时就承认并敬拜祂，故死后寻求祂，并找到祂，发现祂不是别人，正是我们的主。当被问及他们是否知道独一主是一个人时，他们回答说，他们都知道祂是一个人，因为在他们星球，祂作为一个人被许多人看见过；祂教导他们真理、保护他们，并赐永生给那些信祂的人。他们又说，祂向他们揭示当如何生活，当如何去信；祂所揭示的一切从父母传给孩子。教导以这种方式传播到所有家族，由此传播到同出一个先祖的整个民族。他们补充说，他们觉得自己似乎拥有铭刻在他们心上的教导，他们从以下事实得出这个结论：他们能立刻觉察，并自动承认别人所说关于在一个人那里的天堂生活的话是不是真的。</p>

CONTINUATION ABOUT THE SPIRITS AND INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH JUPITER. As regards their Divine worship, the chief point is that they acknowledge our Lord as the Most High, who rules heaven and earth; 
they call Him, The One Only Lord. And because they acknowledge and worship Him during the bodily life, they accordingly seek Him after death, and find that He is the same as our Lord. They were asked 
whether they know that the One Only Lord is a Man? They answered that they all know that He is a Man, because on their earth He has been seen by many as a Man, and because He instructs them in the truth, 
preserves them, and gives eternal life to those who believe in Him. They said further that He has revealed to them how they should live, and how they should believe; and that what has been revealed 
is handed down by the parents to their children, and that thus the teaching spreads to all the families, and thus throughout the whole nation that is from one father. They added that they seem to themselves 
to have the teaching inscribed on their minds, which they conclude from the fact that they instantly perceive, and acknowledge as of themselves, whether what is said by others about the life 
of heaven with man is true, or not. </p>

SPIRITS AND INHABITANTS OF THE PLANET JUPITER - continued </p>
<p>As regards their worship of God, the most important aspect of it is their acknowledgement of our Lord as the Supreme One who governs heaven 
and earth. They call Him the one and only Lord; and because they acknowledge and worship Him during their lifetime they therefore seek Him after death, and find Him. He is none other than our Lord. 
When asked whether they know that the one and only Lord is a Person they replied that they all know Him to be a Person, because He has been seen as a Person by many on their planet; that He informs them 
of the truth, and keeps them in being; and that He imparts eternal life to those who believe in Him. They went on to say that He has revealed to them how they ought to live and how they ought to believe, 
and that what He has revealed is passed down from parents to children. In that way teachings are spread to all the families and so to an entire clan descended from the same father. They said in 
addition that those teachings seem to them to have been inscribed on their minds, a conclusion they come to because they can perceive instantly and recognize automatically whether what others say about 
the life of heaven with a person is true or not. </p>

Continuatio de Spiritibus et Incolis Telluris Jovis Quod cultum eorum Divinum attinet, principale est quod (x)agnoscant Dominum nostrum pro supremo, Qui regit caelum et terram; Illum vocant unicum 
Dominum; et quia in vita corporis Ipsum agnoscunt et colunt, inde Ipsum quaerunt post mortem, ac inveniunt; {1}est idem cum nostro Domino.  Interrogati sunt num sciant quod unicus Dominus sit Homo; responderunt 
quod sciant omnes quod Homo sit, quia in orbe illorum a multis visus est ut Homo; et quod Ipse instruat illos de veritate, conservet illos, et quod det vitam aeternam illis qui credunt in Ipsum. 
 Dicebant amplius quod ab Ipso illis revelatum sit quomodo vivent et quomodo credent; et quod id quod revelatum est, a parentibus tradatur liberis, et quod ita emanet doctrina ad omnes familias, 
et sic {2}in totam gentem quae (c)ab uno patre.  Addebant quod {3}videatur illis sicut habeant doctrinam mentibus suis inscriptam, quod {4}concludunt ex eo, quia percipiunt ilico, et agnoscunt sicut 
ex se, num verum sit vel non, quod ab alis de vita caeli apud hominem dicitur. 	@1 estque$ 	@2 ad universam$ 	@3 appareat$ 	@4 concludere possunt$ </p>
