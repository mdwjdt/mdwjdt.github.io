<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6222节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6222.</strong>“他就带着两个儿子玛拿西和以法莲同去”表由内在所生的教会的意愿和教会的理解力。这从“玛拿西”和“以法莲”的代表清楚可知：“玛拿西”是指属世层中新的意愿及其性质，如前所述（<a href="5354.htm">5354</a>e节）；“以法莲”是指属世层中新的理解力及其性质（<a href="5354.htm">5354</a>节）。这二者由内在所生，由他们是约瑟的儿子来表示，而约瑟代表内在属天层（<a href="5869.htm">5869</a>，<a href="5877.htm">5877</a>节）。<br />有必要解释一下何谓教会的理解力和意愿。教会的理解力在于从圣言觉知何为信之真理，何为仁之良善。众所周知，圣言的字义具有这样的性质：人能利用字义来证实他所信奉的任何信条。这是因为圣言字义上的观念是接受真理的总体容器，只是在这些容器接受真理之前，它们的真实性质并未如同通过透明的东西那样显现。因此，这些观念只形成人必须首先获得的总体印象，以便他能适宜地接受特定方面和具体细节。圣言的字义具有这样的性质，人能利用字义来证实他所信奉的任何信条；这一事实从曾经存在于教会，并且现仍存在于教会中的大量异端邪说清楚看出来。每个异端邪说的信徒都能在圣言的字义中找到支持，并且如此确认，以致他们完全相信它是真理；以后即便从天上听见真正的真理，他们也丝毫不会接受。<br />他们之所以不接受，是因为他们没有教会的理解力；事实上，只有当人们阅读圣言，对经文仔细进行彼此对照，从而明白他当信什么、当做什么时，这种理解力才会存在。这种理解力只在那些从主领受光明的人中间才能找到，他们在基督教界也被称为“被光照的人”。这种光照只在诸如渴望认识真理，但不是为了名声和荣耀，而是为了生活和服务或功用的那种人中间才能找到。这种光照同样被人里面的理解力所接受，因为被光照的是理解力，或说理解力才是光的接受者。这一点从以下事实非常清楚地看出来：那些几乎没什么理解力的人绝无可能从圣言看见这类事物，而是信靠他们以为被光照了的那些人。此外，要知道，那些已经重生的人从主获得一种能被光照的理解力；正是来自主的天堂之光流入理解力，并光照它，或说赋予它光明；因为理解力并不从其它源头接受自己的光、自己的视觉，因而自己的觉知。<br />不过，被称为教会理解力的这种理解力比只是基于记忆知识的理解力更为内在，因为它是一种觉知，明白某事是真的，但不是出于记忆知识和哲学的指示，乃出于圣言在其灵义上的指示。例如，拥有教会理解力的人能清楚发觉，圣言处处教导：对主之爱和对邻之仁是教会的本质；人的生命死后仍旧延续；他的生命就源于他的爱。他们还能发觉，与仁分离之信并非信；除非在对主之爱的良善和对邻之仁的良善与它联结的情况下，否则，这信丝毫无助于永生；因此，这信与仁必须联结起来，以便属灵的生命能够存在。拥有被光照的理解力的人能极清楚地发觉这些事是真的；而那些没有这种理解力的人决看不出它们是真的。<br />有人认为拥有在教会事物上的理解力之人是那些擅长多方面证实他们自己教会的信条或教义，甚至直到说服别人相信它们是真的，而且还擅长巧妙地驳斥众多异端邪说的人。但是，这并不是教会的理解力；因为能证实一个信条并不是理解力的一个特征，而是感官层面的心智能力的一个特征；这种能力有时可见于最坏的人当中，事实上，根本没有任何信仰的人，以及那些沉浸于实际虚假的人也有这种能力。对所有这类人来说，再没有比证实凡他们所喜欢的任何观念更容易的了，甚至能证实得如此彻底，以至于能说服简单人相信。然而，在证实任何信条之前，教会的理解力就能发觉并看出它是不是真的，然后才去证实它。<br />这就是“以法莲”所代表的理解力。而“玛拿西”所代表的教会良善则是主通过信之真理灌输给一个教会成员的仁之良善。因为这些真理，连同仁之良善才是那流入理解力并光照它，或说赋予它光明，还使得理解力和意愿构成一个心智的东西。理解力和意愿这二者都是从内在而生的，这一点从前面频繁的阐述和说明可以看出来；因为对良善与真理的整个情感（光照便通过这情感而来），除了从内在之外，并不从其它源头流入，因而并不从其它源头而生；也就是说，它经由内在从主而来。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6222</b></p><p><b>6222.</b>
And he took his two sons with him, Manasseh and Ephraim. That this signifies the will and the intellectual of the church born from the internal, is evident from the representation of Manasseh, as being 
the new will in the natural, and its quality (concerning which see n. 5354e); and from the representation of Ephraim, as being the new intellectual in the natural, and its quality (n. 5354); that they 
were born from the internal is signified by their being the sons of Joseph, by whom is represented the internal celestial (n. 5869, 5877). [2] It is necessary to explain what is meant by the intellectual 
and the will of the church. The intellectual of the church is to perceive from the Word what the truth of faith is, and what the good of charity. It is known that the literal sense of the Word 
is of such a nature that whatever tenet a man embraces, he confirms from that sense; and this because the things of the literal sense of the Word are general vessels which receive truths, and because 
the quality of these vessels does not appear as through a transparency until they have received truths; thus because they are only generals, which must first be learned by man, in order that he may 
receive the particulars and singulars in a fit and proper manner. That the literal sense of the Word is of such a nature that whatever tenet a man embraces he confirms from that sense, is very manifest 
from so many heresies which have existed in the church, and still do so, each of which is confirmed by its partisans from the literal sense of the Word, and so confirmed that they thoroughly believe 
it to be true; and thereafter if they were to hear from heaven the very truth, they would not receive a bit of it. [3] The reason is that they have not the intellectual of the church; for the intellectual 
of the church consists in a man's perceiving, when he reads the Word and carefully compares one passage with another, what is to be believed, and what is to be done. This intellectual is to be 
found in such men only as are enlightened by the Lord, and who in the Christian world are also called the enlightened; and this enlightenment is to be found in such men only as desire to know truths, 
not for the sake of reputation and glory, but for the sake of life and use. This very enlightenment is received by the intellectual in a man, for it is the intellectual which is enlightened. This is very 
evident from the fact that they who have little of the intellectual cannot possibly see such things from the Word; but have faith in those whom they believe to be enlightened. Be it known further 
that they who have been regenerated, receive from the Lord an intellectual capable of being enlightened. It is the light of heaven from the Lord which flows into the intellectual and enlightens it; for 
the intellectual has its light, its sight, and consequently its perception, from no other source. [4] But this intellectual, which is called the intellectual of the church, is more interior than the 
intellectual which comes from mere memory-knowledges, for it is a perception that the thing is so, not from the dictate of memory-knowledges and philosophy, but from the dictate of the Word in its spiritual 
sense. For example, they who are in the intellectual of the church are able clearly to perceive that the Word everywhere teaches that love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor are essentials 
of the church; and that the life of man remains after death; and that his life is from his loves; also that faith separate from charity is not faith; and that faith avails nothing for eternal life 
except insofar as it is joined to the good of love to the Lord and to the good of charity toward the neighbor; consequently that these and faith must be conjoined together for there to be spiritual 
life. That these are truths can be clearly perceived by those who have the intellectual enlightened, but not at all by those who have not this. [5] It is believed that those have an intellectual in 
the things of the church who are skillful in confirming the tenets or doctrinals of their own church by many things, and this even to persuasion that it is so, and who also are skillful in dexterously 
confuting many heresies. But this is not the intellectual of the church; for to confirm a tenet is not of the intellectual, but of ingenuity in the sensuous, and it is sometimes found in the worst of 
men, and can also be done by those who believe nothing whatever, and also by those who are in very falsities. Nothing is more easy than for all such persons to confirm whatever they please, even to 
the point of persuading the simple. But the intellectual of the church is to perceive and see, before any tenet is confirmed, whether it is true or not, and then to confirm it. [6] This is the intellectual 
which is represented by Ephraim; but the good of the church, which is represented by Manasseh, is the good of charity which is insinuated by the Lord into the man of the church by means of the 
truths of faith; for these, together with the good of charity, are what flow into the intellectual and enlighten it, and also make the intellectual and the will constitute one mind. That both the intellectual 
and the will are born from the internal, may be seen from what has frequently been said and shown above; for all the affection of good and truth, by which comes enlightenment, flows from no other 
source, and thus is born from no other source, than the internal; that is, through the internal from the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6222</b></p><p><b>6222.</b>
'And he took his two sons with him, Manasseh and Ephraim' means the Church's will and the Church's understanding, born from the internal. This is clear from the representation of 'Manasseh' as the new 
will in the natural and its essential nature, dealt with in <a href="5354.htm">5354</a> (end); and from the representation of 'Ephraim' as the new understanding in the natural and its essential nature, dealt with in <a href="5354.htm">5354</a>. 
The birth of the two from the internal is meant by the fact that they were the sons of Joseph, who represents the internal celestial, <a href="5869.htm">5869</a>, <a href="5877.htm">5877</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 What the Church's understanding is and what its 
will is must be stated. The Church's understanding consists in perceiving from the Word what the truth of faith is and what the good of charity is. As is well known, the literal sense of the Word is 
by nature such that a person can use that sense to support any opinion at all that he may adopt. The reason for this is that ideas appearing in the literal sense of the Word serve as general vessels 
to receive truths, though not until they have actually received truths does the real nature of those vessels reveal itself as if through transparency. Thus those ideas form merely a general impression 
which a person must gain first in order that he may aptly receive particular aspects and specific details. This fact - that the literal sense of the Word is by nature such that a person can use that 
sense to support any opinion at all that he may adopt - is clearly evident from the great number of heresies that have existed in the Church, and still exist in it. Adherents of each heresy find support 
for it in the literal sense of the Word, support which enables them to believe fully that it is the truth, which means that if they were to hear the actual truth from heaven they would receive nothing 
at all of it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The reason why they would not receive it is that they do not share in the understanding that the Church possesses; for that understanding exists when people read the Word, assiduously 
take one statement together with another, and by doing so see what they ought to believe and what they ought to do. Such understanding comes only to those who receive light from the Lord, whom 
the Christian world also calls 'the enlightened'. That enlightenment does not come to any but the kind of people who have the desire to know truths, not for the sake of reputation and glory but for 
the sake of life and service. That same enlightenment is received by a person in his understanding, for the understanding is the receiver of light. This is clearly evident from the fact that people who 
have little understanding cannot by any means see such things from the Word but have faith in those who they think are the enlightened. Furthermore it should be recognized that those who have been regenerated 
receive from the Lord an understanding which is capable of being enlightened; and it is the light of heaven coming from the Lord that flows into the understanding and gives it light, for the 
understanding receives its light, its sight, and consequently its perception from no other source. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 But this understanding which is being called the Church's understanding is more internal than 
an understanding based merely on factual knowledge, for it consists in a discernment that a thing is true not because factual evidence and philosophical deductions dictate it but because the Word in 
its spiritual sense does so. For example, people who possess the Church's understanding can perceive clearly that in every single part the Word teaches that love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour 
are the essential qualities of the Church, that a person's life continues after death, and that his life arises out of his loves. They can also perceive that faith separated from charity is not 
faith, that faith contributes nothing to eternal life except in the measure that the good of love to the Lord and the good of charity towards the neighbour are linked to it, and that faith and charity 
must therefore be joined together so that spiritual life may exist. People with an enlightened understanding can perceive quite clearly that these things are true; but those without it can by no means 
see that they are. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 It is thought that the people with an understanding in things of the Church are those who know how to substantiate extensively the opinions or teachings of their Church, 
to the point of convincing others that they are true, and who know how to refute numerous heresies in a masterly way. But this is not what is meant by the Church's understanding, for substantiating opinions 
is not a characteristic of the understanding but of mental ability at a sensory level, which sometimes comes to exist in very wicked people; indeed those without any beliefs at all, also those 
who are steeped in actual falsities, can have that ability. Nothing comes more easily to both these kinds of people than to substantiate whatever idea they like, so thoroughly that they convince the 
simple. But before substantiating any opinion the Church's understanding engages in seeing and perceiving whether it is true or not, and in substantiating it only after that. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 This understanding 
is what is represented by 'Ephraim'. But the Church's good, which is represented by 'Manasseh', is the good of charity, which the Lord instills into a member of the Church through the truths of faith. 
For these truths together with the good of charity are what flow into the understanding and give it light, and also enable the understanding and the will to constitute one mind. The truth that both 
these - the understanding and the will - are born from the internal may be seen from what was stated and shown previously; for the whole affection for goodness and truth, the affection through which enlightenment 
comes, flows in from no other origin, thus is born from no other origin than the internal; that is, it comes from the Lord through the internal.  </p>

`Et accepit duos filios suos secum, Menashen et  Ephraimum':  quod significet (t)Ecclesiae voluntarium et Ecclesiae Intellectuale ab interno nata, constat ex repraesentatione `Menashis' quod sit novum 
voluntarium {1} in naturali et quale ejus, de qua n.5354 ad fin.; et (c)ex repraesentatione `Ephraimi' quod sit novum intellectuale in naturali et quale ejus, de qua n. 5354; quod ab interno nata sint, 
significatur per quod essent `filii Josephi' per quem caeleste internum repraesentatur, n. 5869, 5877.  [2]Quid Ecclesiae intellectuale, et Ecclesiae voluntarium, dicendum est:  Ecclesiae intellectuale 
est percipere ex Verbo quid verum fidei et quid bonum charitatis; notum est quod sensus litteralis Verbi talis sit ut quodcumque dogma homo arripit, ex illo sensu id confirmet; causa est quia illa 
quae sunt sensus litteralis Verbi, sunt vasa communia quae recipiunt vera, et quod vasa illa, non nisi quam cum receperint {2}vera, appareant quasi per transparentiam qualia sunt; ita quod sint modo 
{3}communia quae ab homine primum haurienda sunt ut apte recipere possit particularia et singularia; quod sensus litteralis Verbi talis sit ut quodcumque dogma homo arripit, ex illo sensu confirmet, 
patet manifeste ex tot heresibus quae in Ecclesia fuerunt, et quae adhuc sunt, quarum unaquaevis a sectariis confirmatur ex sensu litterali Verbi, {4}ac ita ab illis confirmatur, ut {5} prorsus credatur 
quod ita sit; et tunc si ipsum verum {6}de caelo audirent, ne hilum {7}reciperent; [3]causa est quod illis non Ecclesiae intellectuale sit; Ecclesiae enim intellectuale est cum homo legit Verbum 
et unum cum altero sedulo confert, quod percipiat inde quid credendum et quid faciendum; hoc non cadit nisi in tales qui illustrantur a Domino, et (t)quoque qui in orbe Christiano illustrati vocantur; 
et illustratio illa {8}non cadit in alios quam in tales qui vera scire desiderant, non propter famam et gloriam sed propter vitam et usum; ipsa illa illustratio recipitur ab intellectuali apud hominem, 
nam intellectuale est quod illustratur; hoc patet manifeste ex eo quod qui parum intellectualis habent, nequaquam possint ex Verbo talia videre, sed quod fidem habeant illis quos credunt illustratos 
esse. Praeterea sciendum quod qui regenerati sunt, accipiant a Domino intellectuale quod illustrari potest; est lux caeli a Domino quae influit in intellectuale ac illustrat illud; intellectuale enim 
non aliunde suam lucem, suum visum, proinde suam perceptionem habet.  [4]Sed intellectuale hoc quod Ecclesiae intellectuale vocatur, interius est quam intellectuale quod modo est ex scientificis, est 
enim apperceptio quod ita sit, non quod scientifica et philosophica id dictant, sed quia Verbum in sensu suo spirituali; ut pro exemplo:  qui in Ecclesiae intellectuali sunt, clare possunt percipere 
quod Verbum in omnibus et singulis doceat quod amor in Dominum et charitas erga proximum sint {9}essentialia Ecclesiae, et quod vita hominis maneat post mortem, quodque vita ejus sit ex amoribus ejus; 
tum quod fides separata a charitate non sit fides, et quod fides nihil faciat ad vitam aeternam nisi quantum ea adjungitur bono amoris in Dominum et bono charitatis erga proximum; proinde quod conjuncta 
erunt ut (t)sit vita spiritualis; quod haec vera sint, clare percipere possunt illi qui intellectuale illustratum habent, sed qui id non habent, id nequaquam videre possunt.  [5]Creditur quod illi 
intellectuale in rebus Ecclesiae habeant qui sciunt dogmata seu doctrinalia suae Ecclesiae  multis confirmare, et hoc usque ad persuasionem quod ita sit, et  quoque qui sciunt plures haereses dextre 
refellere; sed hoc non est intellectuale Ecclesiae, nam confirmare dogma non est intellectualis sed est ingenii in sensuali, et cadit quandoque in {10}pessimos, et id facere possunt qui prorsus nihil 
credunt et quoque {11}qui in ipsis falsis sunt; his {12}et illis nihil facilius est quam confirmare quodcumque lubet, usque adeo ut simplices persuadeantur; sed intellectuale Ecclesiae est percipere 
et videre, antequam aliquod dogma confirmatur, num verum sit vel non, et dein confirmare; [6]hoc intellectuale est quod per `Ephraimum' {13} repraesentatur; Ecclesiae autem bonum quod per `Menashen' repraesentatur, 
est bonum charitatis quod a Domino insinuatur homini Ecclesiae per vera fidei; haec enim una cum bono charitatis (m)sunt quae influunt in intellectuale et illustrant illud, et quoque (n)faciunt 
ut intellectuale et voluntarium unam mentem constituant.  Quod utrumque, nempe {14} intellectuale et {14} voluntarium, ab interno natum sit, constare potest ex illis quae prius saepius dicta 
et ostensa sunt, nam omnis affectio (t)boni et veri' per quam illustratio, non aliunde influit, {15}ita non aliunde nascitur quam ab interno, hoc est, per internum a Domino. @1 i etiam$ @2 illa$ @3
