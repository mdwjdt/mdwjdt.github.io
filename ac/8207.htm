<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8207.</strong>出埃及记14:23-25.埃及人追袭，跟在他们后头，法老一切的马匹、战车和马兵都进入海中间。到了晨更的时候，耶和华从云火柱中眺望埃及人的营，使埃及人的营混乱了。又使他的轮脱落，使他们驾车沉重，以致埃及人说，我要从以色列面前逃跑；因耶和华为他们与埃及人争战。<br />“埃及人追袭”表邪恶所生的虚假施暴的企图。“跟在他们后头”表流入的企图。“法老一切的马匹、战车和马兵都进入海中间”表属于败坏理解力的记忆知识，支持虚假的教义事物，以及推理，它们充满地狱。“到了晨更的时候”表那些沉浸于邪恶所生虚假之人的黑暗和毁灭的状态，以及那些处于源于良善的真理之人的启示和得救的状态。“耶和华眺望埃及人的营”表神性流注从祂那里伸向那些正企图通过虚假施暴的人。“从云火柱中”表神的良善和真理在那里以这种方式同在。“使埃及人的营混乱了”表结果，由邪恶所生虚假的延伸又回到他们身上。“又使他的轮脱落”表推进虚假的能力被夺走。“使他们驾车沉重”表抵抗和无能为力。“以致埃及人说”表他们那时的思考。“我要从以色列面前逃跑”表与那些处于真理之良善和良善之真理之人的分离。“因耶和华为他们与埃及人争战”表唯独主承受与虚假和邪恶的争战。</p>

Verses 23-25. And the Egyptians pursued, and came after them, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen, into the midst of the sea. And it was in the morning watch, and Jehovah looked forth 
to the camp of the Egyptians in the pillar of fire and of cloud, and troubled the camp of the Egyptians. And He took off the wheel of his chariots, and he drew it in heaviness; and the Egyptian said, 
I will flee before Israel, because Jehovah wageth war for them against the Egyptians. "And the Egyptians pursued," signifies an endeavor of falsity from evil to inflict violence; "and came after them," 
signifies the endeavor of the influx; "all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen, into the midst of the sea," signifies memory-knowledges from a perverted understanding, doctrinal things 
of falsity, and reasonings, that they filled hell; "and it was in the morning watch," signifies the state of thick darkness and destruction of those who are in falsity from evil, and the state of enlightenment 
and salvation of those who are in truth and good; "and Jehovah looked forth to the camp of the Egyptians," signifies the extension thence of Divine influx toward those who were endeavoring 
to inflict violence by means of falsities; "in the pillar of fire and of cloud," signifies the presence in this manner of Divine good and truth there; "and troubled the camp of the Egyptians," signifies 
that the consequent extensions of falsity and evil returned upon them; "and He took off the wheel of his chariots," signifies the power of inflicting falsities taken away; "and he drew it in heaviness," 
signifies resistance and impotence; "and the Egyptian said," signifies the thought under these circumstances; "I will flee before Israel," signifies separation from those who are in the good of 
truth and the truth of good; "because Jehovah wageth war for them against the Egyptians," signifies that the Lord alone sustains the fight against falsities and evils. </p>

Verses 23-25 And the Egyptians pursued, and came after them - all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen - into the middle of the sea. And so it was in the morning watch, that Jehovah looked 
out onto the camp of the Egyptians, from within the pillar of fire and cloud, and troubled the camp of the Egyptians. And He took off the wheels of his chariots and made them<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> drive heavily; and the 
Egyptians said, Let us flee before Israel, for Jehovah fights for them against the Egyptians. </p>
<p>'And the Egyptians pursued' means the attempt by falsity arising from evil to do violence. 'And came after 
them' means the attempt to flow in. 'All Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen - into the middle of the sea' means factual knowledge belonging to a perverted understanding, doctrinal teachings 
upholding falsity, and reasonings - that they filled hell. 'And so it was in the morning watch' means a state of thick darkness and perdition for those steeped in falsity arising from evil, and 
a state of enlightenment and salvation for those guided by truth springing from good. 'That Jehovah looked out onto the camp of the Egyptians' means Divine influx reaching out from Him in the direction 
of those who were attempting to do violence by means of falsities. 'From within the pillar of fire and cloud' means thus the presence of God's goodness and truth there. 'And troubled the camp of 
the Egyptians' means that as a result all their reaching out with falsity arising from evil recoiled on them. 'And He took off the wheels of his chariots' means that the power to advance falsities was 
taken away. 'And made them drive heavily' means resistance and lack of power. 'And the Egyptians said' means their thought then. 'Let us flee before Israel' means separation from those governed by the 
good of truth and guided by the truth of good. 'For Jehovah fights for them against the Egyptians' means that the Lord alone endures the battle against falsities and evils.

Vers.  13-15.  Et persecuti Aegyptii, et venerunt post illos omnes equi Pharaonis, currus illius, et equites illius, ad medium maris.  Et fuit in custodia matutina, et prospexit Jehovah ad castra Aegyptiorum 
in columna ignis et nubis, et perturbavit castra Aegyptiorum.  Et dimovit rotam curruum illius, et duxit illam in gravitate; et dixit Aegyptius, Fugiam coram Israele, quia Jehovah militat pro 
illis in Aegyptios.  `Et persecuti Aegyptii' significat conatum falsi a malo violentiam inferendi: `et venerunt post illos' significat conatum influxus: omnes equi Pharaonis, currus illius, et equites 
illius, in medium maris' significat scientifica ex intellectuali perverso, doctrinalia falsi, et ratiocinia, quod implerent infernum: `et fuit in custodia matutina' significat statum caliginis et interitus 
illorum qui in falso ex malo, et statum illustrationis et salvationis illorum qui in vero {1}ex bono: `et prospexit Jehovah ad castra Aegyptiorum' significat extensionem inde influxus Divini 
versus illos qui per falsa violentiam inferre conabantur: `in columna ignis et nubis' significat sic praesentiam boni et veri Divini ibi: `et perturbavit castra Aegyptiorum' significat quod inde extensiones 
falsi {2}ex malo relaberentur super illos: `et dimovit rotam curruum illius' significat potentiam inferendi falsa ablatam: `et duxit illam in gravitate' significat renisum et impotentiam: `et dixit 
Aegyptius' significat tunc cogitationem: `Fugiam coram Israele' significat separationem ab illis qui in bono veri et vero boni: `quia Jehovah militat pro illis in Aegyptios' significat quod Dominus 
solus sustineat pugnam contra falsa et mala. 	@1 et I$ 	@2 et mali I$ </p>
