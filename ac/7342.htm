<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7342节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7342.</strong>“也不把这事放在心上”表出于意愿的抵制和由此产生的固执。这从“不将某事放在心上”的含义清楚可知，“不将某事放在心上”是指不注意；由于在恶人当中，不注意神性事物是由出于意愿的抵制导致的，所以这句话表示这一点；并且“不把它放在心上”含有和“坚硬”一样的意思，故也表示固执，如前所述（<a href="7272.htm">7272</a>，<a href="7300.htm">7300</a>，<a href="7338.htm">7338</a>节）。至于出于意愿的抵制，要知道，意愿才是那主宰人的。有些人以为主宰人的，是理解力；但理解力并不主宰人，除非意愿有同样的倾向。理解力与意愿是一致的，因为就本身而言，理解力无非是意愿所取的外在形式。此处提到的“意愿”表示人的爱之情感，因为人的爱之情感不是别的。主宰人的，就是这种情感，因为爱之情感就是他的生命。如果人的情感是爱自己爱世界的情感，那么他的整个生命就是这种情感。他也不会抵制它，因为这样做就是抵制他自己的生命。真理的原则不会给人留下任何印象；这些爱的情感若已占据主导地位，就会把真理拉到自己这一边，并歪曲它；如果真理不完全支持它，就会弃绝真理。这解释了为何信所教导的真理原则对人没有任何作用，除非主把属灵之爱，也就是对邻之爱的情感灌输进来。人在何等程度上接受这种情感，也在何等程度上接受信之真理。构成新意愿的，就是这种爱的情感。由此可见，如果意愿有抵制，人永远不会把任何真理放在心上。正因如此，地狱里的人因对他们里面的邪恶拥有一种情感或欲望，所以无法接受信之真理，从而无法得以纠正。也正因如此，恶人会尽可能地歪曲信之真理。</p>

And did not set his heart even to this. That this signifies resistance from the will and the consequent obstinacy, is evident from the signification of "not setting the heart" to anything, as being not 
to attend; and as with the evil no attention to Divine things comes from resistance from the will, therefore this is signified by the same words; and as "not to set the heart" to a thing involves the 
same as "to be made firm," therefore obstinacy also is signified (as before, n. 7272, 7300, 7338). As regards resistance from the will, be it known that the will is that which rules the man. It is 
believed by some that the understanding rules, but the understanding does not rule unless the will inclines; for the understanding favors the will, because regarded in itself the understanding is nothing 
else than the form of the will. When the will is mentioned, there is meant the affection of love, for the will of man is nothing else. This affection is what rules man, for the affection of love is 
his life. If a man's affection is that of self and the world, then his whole life is nothing else, nor can he withstand it, for this would be to withstand his very life. Principles of truth effect nothing; 
if the affection of these loves has dominion, it draws truth over to its side and falsifies it, and if the truth does not fully favor, it rejects it. Hence it is that principles of true faith 
effect nothing whatever with man unless the Lord instills the affection of spiritual love, that is, of love toward the neighbor; and insofar as the man receives this affection, so far he also receives 
the truths of faith. The affection of this love is what makes the new will. From all this it can now be seen that a man never sets his heart to any truth if the will resists. Hence it is that as the 
infernals are in the affection or cupidity of evil, they cannot receive the truths of faith, consequently cannot be amended; and from this also it is that the evil falsify the truths of faith insofar 
as they can. </p>

'And he did not take this to heart' means resistance arising in the will and consequent obstinacy. This is clear from the meaning of 'not taking something to heart' as paying no attention; and since 
among the evil paying no attention to Divine things is the result of resistance arising in the will, this too is meant by those same words. And since 'not taking it to heart' implies the same as being 
unyielding, obstinacy is also meant, as previously in <a href="7272.htm">7272</a>, <a href="7300.htm">7300</a>, <a href="7338.htm">7338</a>. With respect to resistance arising in the will, it should be recognized that the will is what rules a person. Some people think 
that the understanding rules; but the understanding does not do so unless the will has the same leanings. The understanding accords with the will, for regarded in itself the understanding is nothing 
other than the outward form which the will takes. The expression 'the will' is used here to mean the desires that belong to a person's love, for his will is nothing other. Those desires are what rule 
a person, for they are his life. If a person's desires are those of self-love and love of the world, then his entire life is nothing else than such desires. Nor can he resist them, for to do so would 
be to resist his own life. Fundamental ideas of truth make no impression whatever. If the desires belonging to those kinds of love predominate they haul truth over to their own side and so falsify it, 
or if it does not fully support them reject it. This explains why fundamental ideas of truth taught by faith have no effect whatever on a person unless the Lord instills desires belonging to spiritual 
love, that is, love towards the neighbour. And in the measure that he receives those desires he receives also the truths of faith. The desires belonging to this love are what constitute the new will. 
From all this it may now be seen that a person never takes any truth to heart if his will is resistant to it. So it is that those in hell, having an affection or desires for evil within them, cannot 
receive the truths of faith, consequently cannot undergo correction. So it is too that the evil falsify the truths of faith, so far as they can. </p>

`Et non posuit cor suum ad hoc': quod significet (x)renisum ex voluntate, et inde obstinationem, constat ex significatione `non ponere cor ad {1}aliquid quod sit non attendere; et quia non attentio 
ad Divina apud malos est (c)a renisu (c)ex voluntate, idcirco per eadem verba id significatur; et quia `non ponere cor ad illud' idem involvit quod obfirmari, idcirco etiam obstinatio significatur, ut 
prius n. 7272, 7300, (x)7338.  Quod renisum ex voluntate attinet, sciendum est quod voluntas sit quae regit hominem; creditur a quibusdam quod intellectus regat, sed intellectus non regit nisi voluntas 
inclinet, intellectus enim favet voluntati, nam intellectus in se spectatus non est nisi quam forma voluntatis; cum voluntas dicitur, intelligitur affectio quae amoris, voluntas enim hominis nihil 
aliud est; illa affectio est quae regit hominem, nam affectio amoris est vita illius; si homini (t)est affectio {2} sui et mundi, tunc tota vita ejus non aliud est; nec potest ei reniti, nam id foret 
reniti ipsi suae vitae; principia veri nihil faciunt; si affectio amorum illorum dominatur, trahit {3}illa verum in {4}suas partes et sic falsificat illud, et si non plene favet, rejicit; inde est quod 
principia veri fidei prorsus nihil {5}efficiant apud hominem, nisi Dominus {6}insinuet affectionem amoris spiritualis, hoc est, amoris erga proximum; et quantum homo hanc affectionem recipit, tantum 
etiam recipit vera fidei; affectio amoris hujus est quae facit novam voluntatem.  Ex his nunc constare potest quod homo nusquam ponat cor ad aliquod verum, si voluntas renititur; inde est quod infernales 
quia in affectione seu cupiditate mali sunt, non possint recipere vera fidei, consequenter non emendari; inde quoque est quod mali, quantum possunt, vera quae fidei falsificent. 	@1 aliquod$ 	@2
