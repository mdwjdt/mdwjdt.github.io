<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6925节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6925.</strong>水星灵不会停留在同一个地方，或在属于一个太阳系的灵人范围内，而是周游宇宙。这是因为在大人里面，他们与对真实事物的记忆有关，这记忆必须不断被丰富。这就是为何他们被允许四处游历，所到之处都为自己获取知识。他们在旅途中若遇见热爱物质，也就是肉体和世俗事物的灵人，就会避开他们，去往他们听不见这类事物的地方。由此可见，他们的心智被提升至感官层面之上，因此他们在更内在的光中看见事物。我也被允许亲自感知这种光照，当时，他们就在我身边，正和我说话。那时，我发现，我从感官层面退出，以致进入我眼睛的光开始变得微弱和模糊。</p>

The spirits of the earth Mercury do not stay in one place, or within the sphere of the spirits of one world, but wander through the universe. The reason of this is that they relate in the Grand Man to 
the memory of real things, which memory must be continually enriched. Hence it is given them to wander about, and everywhere to acquire for themselves knowledges. If while thus journeying they meet 
with spirits who love material, that is, bodily and earthly things, they shun them, and betake themselves where they do not hear such things. From this it can be seen that their mind is uplifted above 
sensuous things, and thus that they are in interior light. This it was also given actually to perceive when they were near me, and were speaking with me. I then observed that I was withdrawn from sensuous 
things, insomuch that the light of my eyes began to grow dull and obscure. </p>

Spirits who belong to the planet Mercury do not remain in the same place or within the sphere of spirits belonging to one solar system but wander throughout the universe. The reason for this is that 
they are associated with the memory in the Grand Man and that memory needs to be enriched constantly. This is why they have been allowed to wander about and acquire items of knowledge wherever they go. 
If on their travels they meet spirits who love material, that is, bodily and earthly things, they flee from them and take themselves away to a place where they do not hear about those kinds of things. 
From this one may recognize that their mind is raised to a level above the senses and that they see things in a more inward light. This too I have been allowed in actual fact to perceive when they 
have been near me and talking to me. I have noticed at such times that I was removed so far from the level of the senses that the light coming into my eyes began to grow feeble and dim. </p>

Spiritus telluris Mercurii non morantur in uno loco seu intra sphaeram spirituum unius mundi, sed vagantur per universum; causa est quia memoriam rerum in Maximo Homine referant, {1}quae continue locupletabitur; 
inde illis datum est circumvagari et sibi cognitiones ubivis acquirere.  Cum ita peregrinantur, si (t)offendunt spiritus qui materialia, hoc est, corporea et terrestria, amant, eos fugiunt 
seque conferunt {2}illuc ubi (t)talia non audiunt.  Exinde constare potest quod mens eorum elevata sit supra sensualia, (c)et sic quod in lumine interiore sint; hoc {3}quoque dabatur actualiter percipere 
cum prope me essent et mecum loquerentur; animadverti tunc quod abducerer a sensualibus usque adeo ut inciperet lumen oculorum meorum hebetari et obscurum fieri. 	@1 et quoad illa continue volunt 
locupletari$ 	@2 eo$ 	@3 etiam$ </p>
