<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6368节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6368.</strong>“我儿啊，你捕获了猎物便上去”表主通过属天层将许多人从地狱解救出来。这从“捕获了猎物便上去”的含义和犹大的代表清楚可知：“捕获了猎物便上去”是指从地狱中解救出来，如下文所述；犹大，即此处的“我儿”，是指神性属天层（<a href="6363.htm">6363</a>节）。“捕获了猎物便上去”之所以表示从地狱中解救出来，是因为人任由自己就会身处地狱，因为他的意愿和思维若完全源于他自己，无非是邪恶及其虚假，这些邪恶与虚假将他牢牢地与地狱捆绑在一起，以致他若不通过武力，就无法被撕裂。这种撕裂和解救就是那被称为“猎物”的；由于这一切靠主的神性良善实现，所以我们说主通过属天层将许多人地狱中解救出来。<br />不过，要知道，没有人能被撕裂并从地狱中解救出来，除非他活在肉身期间就已处于属灵良善，也就是通过信处于仁；因为若非他已通过信处于这良善，就没有任何东西能接受从主流入的良善；相反，这良善会从主径直流过去，无法固定在某个地方。因此，缺乏属灵良善的人无法被撕裂并从地狱中解救出来。因为一个人活在肉身时所获得的一切状态在来世都会留在他身上，并且得到更充分的发展。对善人来说，良善的状态会保留下来，并充满良善，他们通过这些状态被提入天堂；对恶人来说，邪恶的状态会保留下来并充满邪恶，他们通过这些状态沉入地狱。这就是这句俗语的意思，即：人死的时候是什么样，就仍是什么样。由此明显可知，那些能靠着主通过神性属天层从地狱中被解救出来是谁。</p>

From the prey my son thou art gone up. That this signifies that from the Lord through what is celestial there is deliverance of many from hell, is evident from the signification of "going up from the 
prey," as being deliverance from hell (of which below); and from the representation of Judah, who is here "my son," as being the Divine celestial (n. 6363). That "to go up from the prey" denotes deliverance 
from hell is because man of himself is in hell, for his will and thought from his own is nothing but evil and its falsity, by which he has been so bound to hell that he cannot be torn away without 
violence. This tearing away and deliverance is what is called the "prey;" and because this is done from the Lord's Divine good, it is said that from the Lord through what is celestial is the deliverance 
of many from hell. [2] But be it known that no one can be torn away and delivered from hell unless in the life of the body he has been in spiritual good, that is, in charity through faith; for 
unless he has been in this good through faith, there is nothing to receive the good which flows in from the Lord; but it flows through, except that which can be fixed somewhere; and therefore these 
persons cannot be torn away or delivered from hell. For all the states that a man has acquired in the life of the body are retained in the other life, and are filled; with the good the states of good 
are retained and filled with good, and by means of these states they are elevated into heaven; and with the evil the states of evil are retained and filled with evil, and by means of these states they 
sink down into hell. This is the meaning of the saying that as a man dies, so he remains. This shows who they are that can be delivered by the Lord from hell by means of the Divine celestial. </p>

'From the plunder you have gone up, my son means that through the celestial the Lord accomplishes the deliverance of many from hell. This is clear from the meaning of 'going up from the plunder' as deliverance 
from hell, dealt with below; and from the representation of Judah, to whom 'my son' refers here, as the Divine celestial, dealt with in <a href="6363.htm">6363</a>. The reason 'going up from the plunder' means deliverance 
from hell is that left to himself a person is in hell, for his will and thought, when they spring wholly from himself, are nothing but evil and derivative falsity, which tie him so firmly to 
hell that he cannot be torn away except by force. This tearing away and deliverance is what is called 'the plunder'; and because that is effected by the power of the Lord's Divine Good, it is said that 
through the celestial the Lord accomplishes the deliverance of many from hell. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 But it should be recognized that no one can be torn away and delivered from hell unless during his lifetime spiritual 
good, that is, charity that comes through faith, has existed in him; for unless that good coming through faith has been present in him, there is nothing that can receive the good which flows in 
from the Lord. Instead that good from Him flows straight through, without being able to become fixed anywhere. Consequently those lacking spiritual good cannot be torn away and delivered from hell. For 
all the states that a person has attained during his lifetime remain with him in the next life and are developed more fully. Good states with the good remain and are filled out with good, and by means 
of them those people are raised into heaven; and evil states with the evil remain and are filled with evil, and by means of them these people sink down into hell. This is what is meant by the saying 
that as a person dies, so he remains. From this it is evident who those people are who can be delivered from hell by the Lord through the Divine celestial. </p>

</p><b>6368.</b>
`A praeda, fili mi, ascendisti':  quod significet quod a Domino per caeleste liberatio plurium ab inferno, constat a significatione `a praeda (x)ascendere' quod sit liberatio ab inferno, de qua sequitur; 
et a repraesentatione `Jehudae' qui hic est `fili mi', quod sit Divinum caeleste, de qua n. 6363; quod `a praeda ascendere' sit liberatio ab inferno, est inde quia homo ex se in inferno est, voluntas 
enim et cogitatio ejus ex proprio non est nisi quam malum et inde falsum, per quae ita alligatus est inferno ut inde non possit nisi vi avelli; haec avulsio et liberatio est quae vocatur `praeda'; 
hoc quia fit ex Divino Bono Domini, {1} ideo dicitur quod a Domino per caeleste liberatio plurium ab inferno.  [2]Sed sciendum quod nemo ab inferno avelli (c)et liberari queat nisi in vita corporis 
in bono spirituali fuerit, hoc est, in charitate per fidem; nam nisi in illo bono per fidem fuerit, non est aliquid quod recipit bonum quod influit a Domino, sed transfluit, praeter quod alicubi possit 
figi; inde hi non possunt ab inferno avelli seu liberari; omnes enim status quos homo sibi acquisivit in vita corporis, {2}retinentur in altera vita, et implentur; status boni apud bonos retinentur 
et implentur bono, et per hos elevantur {3}hi in caelum; et status mali apud malos retinentur et implentur malo, et per eos delabuntur in infernum; hoc est quod dicitur quod sicut homo moritur, ita maneat; 
(m)inde patet quinam per Divinum caeleste a Domino liberari possunt ab inferno.(n)   @1 i et quoque per Illud$ @2 retinentur et implentur in altera vita$ @3 illi$ </p>
