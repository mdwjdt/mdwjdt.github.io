<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1275节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1275.</strong>我曾到过一个宁静的社群，也就是说，社群里的人处于宁静的状态，在某种程度上近似于平安的状态，但其实不是平安。我在那里谈到了婴孩的状态，还谈到地方。大意是，地方和距离的变化纯粹是一种表象，取决于每个人的状态及其变化。当我被带到那里时，我周围的灵人似乎被移走了，然后在我下面重新出现；不过，我能听见他们说话。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1275.</strong> I was once in a community marked by calm, or rather by a calm condition approaching peace, in a way, but not fully reaching it.<br />I talked there about the state of little children and about location, saying that variations in place and distance are merely appearances and that they depend on each individual's state and changes in state.<br />While I was being taken there, the spirits around me seemed to be withdrawn and to appear below me, although I was still able to hear them speaking. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1275</b></p><p><b>1275.</b>
I was in a society where there was tranquillity, that is, a society of those whose state was tranquil, approximating in a measure to a state of peace, but it was not peace. I spoke there of the state 
of infants; and also of place, saying that change of place and distance is only an appearance, according to the state of each one, and according to his change of state. When I was translated thither, 
the spirits around me appeared to be removed, and to be seen below me; and yet I could hear them speaking. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1275</b></p><p><b>1275.</b>
I was once in a community where there was a serenity, that is, the state of its members was serene, which came fairly near to being, but was not actually, a state of peace. I talked there about the state 
of small children, and also about place, to the effect that change of place and of distance is purely an appearance directly related to a person's state and change of state. When I was taken there 
the spirits about me seemed to be removed and to reappear below me, though I could still hear them speaking. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1275</b>
</p><b>1275.</b>
Fui in societate ubi tranquillitas, seu quorum status tranquillus accedens quodammodo ad statum pacis, sed non erat pacis: ibi locutus de statu infantum, tum etiam de loco, quod mutatio loci et distantiae 
sit modo apparentia secundum cujusvis statum et ejus mutationem: cum illuc translatus essem, apparebant spiritus circum me removeri, et videri infra me, usque datum eos audire loquentes. </p>
