<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2486.</strong>人会保留其肉体记忆的每一个细节，这一点通过那些活在肉身时我所熟悉的人向我证明了。当我与他们交谈时，他们便回想起我在场时他们所做的每一件事，或他们当时的所言所思。我通过这些以及很多其它经历得以确切地知道，人会带着全部的外部记忆或肉体记忆进入来世。</p>

A certain one was with me whom I had not known during his life in the body. When I inquired whether he knew whence he was, he did not know; but by means of the interior sight he was led by me through 
the cities where I had been, and at length through the city from which he was, and then through its streets and squares, all of which he recognized, and at length into the street where he had dwelt; 
and if I had been acquainted with the houses, and how they were situated, I should have been able to know his house. </p>

the plan of that street I could also have known which was his house.
