<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2556节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2556.</strong>“况且她也实在是我的妹子”表理性真理拥有这样的密切关系。这从作为妹子的撒拉的代表，以及下文有关理性的出身和它随之产生的密切关系的论述清楚可知，作为妹子的撒拉代表理性真理（参看<a href="2508.htm">2508</a>节）。要牢记，一般来说，以真正的理性存在的一切事物，也就是重生之人，即构成其情感、知觉（perception）和思维的一切，彼此联结，如同血缘关系和姻亲关系；因为这些事物被如此排列，以致它们互相关注彼此，如同组成一个家庭的家人，并且是以最为清晰而不同的方式。所以，它们是照着它们所具有的关系而显现的。它们从天堂的流注，即从主经由天堂的流注接受彼此间的这种有序关系。对一个真正理性的人，即重生之人来说，一切事物都被排列进入诸如天堂所具有的那种秩序中；在他里面，一切事物的这种有序排列来自天堂的流注。人通过他里面的这种有序排列而拥有思维、推论、判断和反思的能力，这一过程如此奇妙，以致超越所有人的知识和智慧，并无限超越人类从这些源头所努力得出的分析结论。这些事迄今不为人知，其原因在于，人们不相信构成其情感、知觉和思维的一切事物都是流入进来的（恶的从地狱流入，善的从天堂流入），因而这些事物与在他们之外的那些事物联系在一起；而事实上，就其灵而言，人与那些在他之外的人以这种方式联结起来：他若失去这种联系，片刻不得存活。这一点从以下事实也能得知：没有联系的事物是不可能存在的，并且没有联系的事物会瞬间消失。</p>

And moreover truly she is my sister. That this signifies that rational truth had such an affinity, is evident from the representation of Sarah, as a sister, as being rational truth (see n. 2508); as 
well as from what now follows concerning the birth of the rational, and its consequent affinity. It is to be held in general that all things in a truly rational, that is, a regenerate man-all the things 
of his affections, of his perceptions, and of his thoughts-are conjoined with one another as if by blood relationship and affinity; for they have been so disposed that they mutually regard one another 
as do the families of one house, and this in the most distinct manner; and hence they are reproduced in accordance with these affinities. This they derive from the influx of heaven, that is, of the 
Lord through heaven. With the man who is truly rational, that is, regenerate, all things have been disposed into order such as exists in heaven, and this from influx. From this there is given man a 
faculty of thinking, concluding, judging, and reflecting so wonderful as to exceed all mere human knowledge and wisdom, and immeasurably to surpass the analyses which human industry has drawn from these 
sources. The reason why these things have been hitherto unknown, is that it has not been believed that all things of the affections, perceptions, and thoughts flow in (the evil from hell, and the good 
from heaven), thus that these have a connection with the things which are without them; when yet the truth is that man is so conjoined as to his spirit with those who are without him, that if he were 
deprived of this connection he would not live a single moment; as may also be known from the fact that anything unconnected is impossible, and that anything unconnected perishes in a moment. </p>

'Also she is truly my sister' means that rational truth possessed such a relationship. This is clear from the representation of 'Sarah when a sister' as rational truth, dealt with in <a href="2508.htm">2508</a>, and also from 
what follows next where the subject is the birth of the rational and its consequent relationship. In general it should be kept in mind that all things which exist with a truly rational, that is, regenerate, 
person - all that constitutes his affections, his perceptions, and his thoughts- are interconnected as in blood-relationships and relationships by marriage; for those things have been arranged 
in such a way that they mutually regard one another as families do which make up one house, and this in a most clear and distinct manner. Consequently when they reappear they do so in accordance with 
the relationships in which they exist. This ordered relationship with one another they receive from heaven - that is, from the Lord by way of heaven - flowing into them. With a person who is truly 
rational, that is, regenerate, everything has been arranged into order such as exists in heaven; and this ordered arrangement of everything within him comes as a result of heaven flowing into him. From 
that ordered arrangement within him a person possesses a power of thought, deduction, judgement, and reflection, which is so marvellous that it surpasses all human knowledge and wisdom, infinitely 
surpassing the conclusions which by analysis human effort draws from these sources. The reason these facts have not been known up to now is that people have not believed that all the things which constitute 
their affections, perceptions, and thoughts flow in - evil ones from hell, decent ones from heaven. Thus these have a connection with the things that are outside of them; yet the fact of the matter 
is that man, as regards his spirit, is joined to those outside of him in such a way that if he were deprived of that connection he would not remain alive for a single instant. This may also be recognized 
from the consideration that anything unconnected cannot possibly exist, and that anything unconnected perishes in an instant. </p>

Quod `etiam vere soror mea' significet quod verum rationale talem affinitatem haberet, constat a repraesentatione `Sarae ut sororis' quod sit verum rationale, de qua n. 2508, tum a nunc sequentibus 
quod agatur de nativitate rationalis, et ejus inde affinitate. In genere tenendum, quod omnia et singula apud hominem vere rationalem, hoc est, regeneratum, omnia ejus affectionum, ejus perceptionum, 
et ejus cogitationum, sint, quasi consanguinitate et affinitate, inter se conjuncta; ita enim disposita sunt ut se mutuo spectent sicut familiae unius domus, et hoc distinctissime, inde secundum affinitates 
in quibus sunt, reproducuntur; hoc trahunt ab influxu caeli, hoc est, Domini per caelum; apud hominem qui vere rationalis est, hoc est, regeneratus, omnia disposita sunt in ordinem qualis est in 
caelo, (m)et hoc ab influxu; inde homini facultas cogitandi, concludendi, judicandi, et reflectendi, quae tam mirabilis est ut excedat omnem scientiam et sapientiam humanam, (c)et indefinite analyses 
quas humana industria inde deprompsit.(n)  Quod haec ignorata sint huc usque, est quia non creditum fuit quod omnia affectionum, perceptionum, et cogitationum, influant, malarum ab inferno, et probarum 
e {1} caelo, ita quod nexum habeant cum illis quae extra sunt, cum tamen ita se habet, quod homo quoad spiritum suum ita conjunctus sit cum illis qui extra eum, ut si privaretur nexu inde, ne quidem 
momento viveret; quod etiam sciri potest inde, quod inconnexum nusquam detur, quod inconnexum pereat momento. 	@1 bonarum e.$ </p>
