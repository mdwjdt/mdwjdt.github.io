<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>108.</strong>当上古之人将人比作“园子”时，通常也将智慧比作“河”，不仅拿来作比，也实际以此相称，因为这是他们的言说方式。后来的先知也是如此，有时设为比喻，有时直接以此相称，例如：“你的光必在黑暗中发现，你的幽暗必变如正午……你必像浇灌的园子，又像水流不绝的泉源。”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛58.10.htm">58:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛58.11.htm">11</a>）这话论及接受信与爱之人。<br />又如：“如接连的山谷，如河旁的园子，如耶和华所栽的沉香树，如水边的香柏木。”（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.6.htm">24:6</a>）这话论及重生之人。<br />再如：“倚靠耶和华，以耶和华为可靠的，那人有福了。他必像树栽于水旁，在河边扎根。”（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶17.7.htm">17:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶17.8.htm">8</a>）<br />再如：“众水使它生长，深水使它长大。所栽之地有江河围流，汊出的水道延到田间诸树……树大条长，成为荣美，因为根在众水之旁。神园中的香柏树不能遮蔽它，松树不及它的枝子，枫树不及它的枝条，神园中的树都没有它荣美。我使它的枝条蕃多，成为荣美，以致神伊甸园中的树都嫉妒它。”（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结31.4.htm">31:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结31.7.htm">7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结31.9.htm">9</a>）在此，重生之人不是被比作“园子”或“树”而已，而是直接以此相称 。从以上经文可知，当上古之人将人或人的内在比作“园子”时，通常也拿可滋润园子的“水”或“河”比作可促使人成长之物。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]108.</strong> Since the earliest people compared the human being to a garden, they compared all aspects of wisdom to rivers; or rather than compare them they actually called them those things, because that was their manner of speaking. The prophets later used the same device, sometimes making the comparison, sometimes using the direct name. An example from Isaiah:<br />In the shadows your light will rise, and your darkness will be like daylight; and you will be like a watered garden and like an outlet of water, whose waters will not prove false. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_108/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_58_10-11" target=_top>Isaiah 58:10-11</a>)<br />This passage is talking about people who accept the gift of faith and love. Another example:<br />They are planted as valleys are, as gardens beside the river. Like tents{*1} has Jehovah planted them, like cedars beside the water. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_108/bible_king-james-version_numbers_24_6" target=_top>Numbers 24:6</a>)<br />The subject of this verse is regenerate people. In Jeremiah:<br />Blessed is the man who trusts in Jehovah. He will be like a tree planted by the water, and above the brook he will send out his roots. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_108/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_17_7-8" target=_top>Jeremiah 17:7-8</a>)<br />Here is a passage in Ezekiel in which people are not compared to but called a garden, and trees beside the rivers:<br />The water made [the cedar] grow; the depths of the water raised it up. A river was winding all around its planting-place and sent out its channels of water to all the trees of the field. Beautiful it became in its size, in the length of its branches, because its root was [going out] to many waters. The cedars cast no shadow on it in the garden of God; the firs were not equal to its branches, and the sycamores did not rival its limbs. No tree in God's garden was equal to it in its beauty. Beautiful he made it in the profusion of its branches, and all the trees of Eden in God's garden strove to match it. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_108/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_31_4" target=_top>Ezekiel 31:4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_108/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_31_7" target=_top>7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_108/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_31_8" target=_top>8</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_108/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_31_9" target=_top>9</a>)<br />These quotations indicate that in comparing humans (or what humans have inside them) to a garden, the earliest people included the idea of the water or rivers that watered the garden. It is also apparent that they took the water and rivers to mean the things that would stimulate growth.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The Hebrew word translated as "tents" here (tentoria in the Latin) actually means "sandalwoods" (which in Latin would be santalos, as Swedenborg renders it elsewhere). The context of the quotation — "How good are your tents, Jacob; your dwellings, Israel! They are planted as valleys are, as gardens beside the river. Like sandalwoods has Jehovah planted them" — suggests that the Latin translation is mistaken and that the tents are actually the item being compared here rather than the item to which something else is compared. The cause of the misreading, as the third Latin edition points out, is probably that the Hebrew words for these two objects are nearly identical: אֲהָלִים ('ăhālîm) means "sandalwoods," and אֹהָלִים ('ōhālîm) means "tents." [LHC] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 108</b></p><p><b>108.</b>
The most ancient people, when comparing man to a "garden" also compared wisdom, and the things relating to wisdom, to "rivers;" nor did they merely compare them, but actually so called them, for such 
was their way of speaking. It was the same afterwards in the Prophets, who sometimes compared them, and sometimes called them so. As in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Thy light shall arise in darkness, and thy thick 
darkness shall be as the light of day, and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like an outlet of waters, whose waters lie not (Isa. 58:10-11). Treating of those who receive faith and love. Again, 
speaking of the regenerate: </p>
<p>     As the valleys are they planted, as gardens by the river's side; as lignaloes* which Jehovah hath planted, as cedar-trees beside the waters (Num. 24:6). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p> 
    Blessed is the man who trusteth in Jehovah; he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that sendeth forth her roots by the river (Jer. 17:7-8). In Ezekiel the regenerate are not compared 
to a garden and a tree, but are so called:     The waters made her to grow, the deep of waters uplifted her, the river ran round about her plant, and sent out its channels to all the trees of the field; 
she was made beautiful in her greatness, in the length of her branches, for her root was by many waters. The cedars in the garden of God did not hide her; the fir-trees were not like her boughs, 
and the plane-trees were not like her branches, nor was any tree in the garden of God equal to her in her beauty; I have made her beautiful by the multitude of her branches, and all the trees of Eden 
that were in the garden of God envied her (Ezek. 31:4, 7-9). From these passages it is evident that when the most ancient people compared man, or the things in man, to a "garden" they added the "waters" 
and "rivers" by which he might be watered, and by these waters and rivers meant such things as would cause his growth. * The Latin is tentoria, "tents" seemingly a misprint for santalos. [Reviser.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 108</b></p><p><b>108.</b>
Whenever the most ancient people compared man to a garden they would also compare wisdom and everything connected with it to rivers. Yet they did not merely compare but actually called them such since 
it was characteristic of their speech to do so. At a later time the Prophets in a similar way sometimes compared them, and sometimes actually called them, by these names, as in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Your light 
will rise in the darkness, and your thick darkness will be as the daylight; and you will be like a watered garden and like a spring of waters whose waters fail not. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2058:10,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 58:10, 11</a>.  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
This refers to 
people who receive love and faith. Also,   Like valleys that are planted, like gardens beside a river, like aloes<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> Jehovah has planted, like cedars beside the waters. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2014:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 14:6</a>.   
</blockquote>
This refers to 
people who are regenerate. In Jeremiah,   Blessed is the man who trusts in Jehovah. He will be like a tree planted beside the waters, which will send out its roots above the stream. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2017:7,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 17:7, 8</a>.  </p>
<blockquote>
An 
instance of regenerate people not being compared to, but actually being called, a garden and a tree beside the rivers occurs in Ezekiel,    The waters caused it to grow, the depth of the waters 
made it grow tall, the river leading around the place of its planting, and he sent out his lines of water to all the trees of the field. It became beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its branches, 
for its root was towards many waters. The cedars did not overshadow it in the garden of God, the fir trees were not equal to its branches, and the plane trees were not like its boughs. No tree 
in the garden of God was equal to it in its beauty. I made it beautiful in the mass of its branches, and all the trees of Eden which are in the garden of God envied it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2031:4,%207-9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 31:4, 7-9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From these 
quotations it is clear that when the most ancient people likened man, or what is the same, the things that are in man, to a garden, they also added the waters and rivers by which it was watered, and 
that by 'waters and rivers' they understood the things which would cause growth.

<h4>Notes</h4><small>
<a name="fn1"></a><a href="#fntext1"><sup>a</sup></a> The word used in <a href="1.htm">1</a>st Latin edition means tents, but in other places where Sw. quotes this text a word meaning aloes 
occurs. In Hebrew the spelling, though not the pronunciation, of the two words is identical.

Antiquissimi cum comparabant hominem horto, etiam sapientiam et quae sunt sapientiae, comparabant fluviis; nec cor parabant, sed vocabant, nam talis eorum erat loquela; similiter de apud Prophetas, 
qui ita passim comparabant, passim vocabant; apud Esaiam, 	Exorietur in tenebris lux tua, et caligo tua erit sicut lux diei,...et eris sicut hortus irriguus, et sicut exitus aquarum cujus non mentientur 
aquae, lviii {x}10, 11; </p>
<p>ubi de iis qui recipiunt fidem et amorem, agitur: tum, 	Sicut valles plantantur, sicut horti juxta fluvium: sic santalos {1} plantavit Jehovah, sicut cedros juxta aquas, 
Num. xxiv 6; </p>
<p>ubi de regeneratis: apud Jeremiam, 	Benedictus vir, qui confidit in Jehovah,...erit sic arbor plantata juxta aquas, et supra rivum emittet radices suas, xvii 7, 8. Quod non comparati horto
