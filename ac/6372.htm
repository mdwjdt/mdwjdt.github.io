<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6372节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6372.</strong>“立法者必不离他两脚之间”表低层事物中来自这国度的真理。这从“立法者”和“脚”的含义清楚可知：“立法者”是指真理，如下文所述；“脚”是指属世事物（参看<a href="2162.htm">2162</a>，<a href="3147.htm">3147</a>，<a href="3761.htm">3761</a>，<a href="3986.htm">3986</a>，<a href="4280.htm">4280</a>，<a href="4938.htm">4938</a>-<a href="4952.htm">4952</a>，<a href="5327.htm">5327</a>，<a href="5328.htm">5328</a>节），因而是指低层事物，因为属世事物在下，如刚才所说的属天事物在上。说“他两脚之间的立法者”是为了表示属天国度的属灵国度，或源于良善的真理；因为那时，属灵国度与属天国度没有区别，也没有分离，不像主来之后；相反，它与属天国度构成一体，不过，只是它的外在部分。因此，“他两脚之间”这句话也用来表示源于良善的真理，因为两脚之间的部分通过它与两腰的联系而表示那真理。论到这真理，还说到当“细罗来到时”，它必离开；也就是说，它的权柄和掌控，就像刚才（参看<a href="6371.htm">6371</a>节）所说的属天国度的权柄和掌控一样，也必离开。<br />那时，属天国度通过这真理行使自己的权柄和掌控；这解释了为何这真理被称为“立法者”。在以赛亚书，“立法者”在内义上也表示这真理：<br />耶和华是我们的审判者，耶和华是我们的立法者，耶和华是我们的君王。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛33.22.htm">33:22</a>）<br />“审判者”表示祂出于良善行事；“立法者”表示祂出于源于这良善的真理行事；“君王”表示祂出于真理行事；因此，它们一个接一个依次到来。诗篇：<br />基列是我的，玛拿西也是我的，以法莲是我头的力量，犹大是我的立法者。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗60.7.htm">60:7</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗108.8.htm">108:8</a>）<br />“犹大立法者”是指属天良善及其属天真理。摩西五经：<br />这井是首领们所挖的，是民中的尊贵人奉立法者的命，用杖所挖的。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.18.htm">21:18</a>）<br /><br />迦得为自己看中了最好的，因为那时有隐藏立法者的分；百姓的首领从那里来，他施行耶和华的公义，和耶和华与以色列所立的典章。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.21.htm">33:21</a>）<br />此处“立法者”也表示源于良善的真理。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6372</b></p><p><b>6372.</b>
And a lawgiver from between his feet. That this signifies truths from this good in lower things, is evident from the signification of a "lawgiver," as being truths (of which below); and from the signification 
of "feet," as being natural things (see n. 2162, 3147, 3761, 3986, 4280, 4938-4952, 5327, 5328), thus lower things, for natural things are beneath, and celestial things (just now described) 
are above. It is said a "lawgiver from between his feet" in order that the spiritual of the celestial may be signified, or the truth which is from good, for at that time the spiritual kingdom was not 
such as it was after the Lord's coming-distinct from the celestial kingdom-but was one with the celestial kingdom, being merely its external; therefore also it is said "from between his feet," in order 
that truth which is from good may be signified; for this is signified by this inner side of the feet, from its communication with the loins. Of this truth it is also said that it should be "removed 
when Shiloh came," that is, its sovereignty should be removed, just as was the sovereignty of the celestial (see n. 6371); for the celestial kingdom at that time exercised its sovereignty by means of 
this truth; and because this was so, this truth is called a "lawgiver." This truth is also meant in the internal sense by a "lawgiver" in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah is our judge, Jehovah is our lawgiver, Jehovah 
is our king (Isa. 33:22); </p>
<p>where "judge" denotes that He acts from good; "lawgiver," that He acts from truth from this good; "king," that He acts from truth; thus they follow in order. And in David: </p>
<p> 
    Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine, and Ephraim is the strength of My head, Judah is My lawgiver (Ps. 60:7; 108:8); </p>
<p>where "Judah a lawgiver" is celestial good and its celestial truth. In 
Moses: </p>
<p>     The fountain, the princes digged it, the nobles of the people digged it out, by the lawgiver, with their staves (Num. 21:18). And again: </p>
<p>     Gad saw the first fruits for himself, for 
there was the portion of the hidden lawgiver; whence came the heads of the people; he wrought the righteousness of Jehovah, and His judgments with Israel (Deut. 33:21); </p>
<p>where also "lawgiver" denotes 
truth from good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6372</b></p><p><b>6372.</b>
'Or a lawgiver from between his feet' means truths from that kingdom in Lower things. This is clear from the meaning of 'a lawgiver' as truths, dealt with below, and from the meaning of 'feet' as natural 
things, dealt with in <a href="2162.htm">2162</a>, <a href="3147.htm">3147</a>, <a href="3761.htm">3761</a>, <a href="3986.htm">3986</a>, <a href="4280.htm">4280</a>, <a href="4938.htm">4938</a>-<a href="4952.htm">4952</a>, <a href="5327.htm">5327</a>, <a href="5328.htm">5328</a>, thus lower ones; for natural things are beneath, and the celestial ones, spoken of just before now, are above. The expression 
'a lawgiver from between his feet' is used to mean the spiritual of the celestial, or truth that is derived from good; for at that time there was no spiritual kingdom distinct and separate from 
the celestial kingdom, like that after the Lord's Coming; rather, it made one with the celestial kingdom, except that it formed the external part of it. For this reason the words 'from between his feet' 
are also used to mean truth that is derived from good, for the part in between the feet, from its communication with the loins, means that truth. Referring to this truth it is also said that it would 
be removed 'when Shiloh comes'; that is to say, its power and control, like the power and control of the celestial spoken of immediately above in <a href="6371.htm">6371</a>, would be removed. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The celestial kingdom 
exercised its power and control in those times through that truth, which explains why this truth is called 'a lawgiver'. The same truth is also meant in the internal sense by 'lawgiver' in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah 
is our judge, Jehovah is our lawgiver, Jehovah is our king. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2033:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 33:12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Judge' stands for Him when He acts from good, 'legislator' when He acts from truth deriving from that good, and 'king' 
when He acts from truth - sources of action which also follow one another in that order. In David,  </p>
<blockquote>
Gilead is Mine, Manasseh is Mine, and Ephraim is the strength of My head, Judah is My lawgiver. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2060:7,%20108:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 60:7, 108:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Judah the lawgiver' stands for celestial good and accompanying celestial truth. In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
The well<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> which the princes dug, which the chiefs of the people dug out, as directed 
by the lawgiver, with their staves. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2021:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 21:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
Gad chose the best<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> for himself, for there was the portion of the hidden lawgiver; from there came the heads of the people, 
he administered Jehovah's righteousness, and His judgements with Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2033:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 33:21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'lawgiver' stands for truth from good.

`Et legislator ab inter pedes ejus':  quod significet vera quae ab illo in inferioribus, constat a significatione `legislatoris' quod sint vera, de qua sequitur; et a significatione `pedum' quod sint 
naturalia, de qua n. 2162, 3147, 3761, 3986, 4280, 4938-4952, 5327, 5328, ita inferiora; nam naturalia sunt {1}infra, et caelestia, de quibus nunc prius, supra.  `Legislator ab inter pedes' dicitur 
ut significetur (t)spirituale caelestis', seu verum quod ex {2}bono, non enim eo tempore fuit regnum spirituale, quale post Adventum Domini, distinctum a regno caelesti, sed erat unum cum {3}caelesti, 
modo quod externum ejus esset; ideo quoque dicitur `ab inter pedes' ut significetur verum quod a bono, nam pars illa pedum interior ex communicatione cum lumbis id significat; de hoc vero etiam dicitur 
quod removeretur `cum venit Shiloh', quod nempe ejus potestas, sicut {4}potestas caelestis, de qua re mox supra n. 6371; [2]caeleste enim regnum tunc potestatem suam exercebat per id verum; et quia
