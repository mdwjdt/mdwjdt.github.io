Verses 8-12. Thou Judah, thy brethren shall celebrate thee, thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies, thy father's sons shall bow down to thee. Judah is a lion's whelp; from the prey my son thou 
art gone up; he bowed, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up? The scepter shall not be removed from Judah, and a lawgiver from between his feet, even until Shiloh come; and 
to him is the obedience of the peoples. He binds his young ass unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washes his clothing in wine, and his covering in the blood of grapes; his eyes 
are red with wine, and his teeth are white with milk. "Thou Judah," signifies the celestial church, in the supreme sense the Lord as to the Divine celestial; "thy brethren shall celebrate thee," signifies 
that this church is eminent above the rest; "thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies," signifies that the infernal and diabolical crew will flee at his presence; "thy father's sons shall 
bow down to thee," signifies that truths will submit themselves of their own accord; "Judah is a lion's whelp," signifies innocence with innate forces; "from the prey my son thou art gone up," signifies 
that from the Lord through the celestial there is deliverance of many from hell; "he bowed, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion," signifies the good of love and the derivative truth in their 
power; "who shall rouse him up?" signifies that he is safe among all in the hells; "the scepter shall not be removed from Judah," signifies that sovereignty shall not depart from celestial good; "and 
a lawgiver from between his feet," signifies truths from this good in lower things; "until Shiloh come," signifies the coming of the Lord, and the tranquillity of peace then; "and to him is the obedience 
of the peoples," signifies that from His Divine Human shall proceed truths; "he binds his young ass unto the vine," signifies truth in the natural for the external church; "and his ass's colt unto 
the choice vine," signifies truth from the rational for the internal church; "he washes his clothing in wine," signifies that His natural is Divine truth from His Divine good; "and his covering in the 
blood of grapes," signifies that His intellectual is Divine good from His Divine love; "his eyes are red with wine," signifies that the intellectual, or internal Human, is nothing but good; "and his 
teeth are white with milk," signifies that the Divine natural is nothing but the good of truth. </p>

Verses 8-12 Judah are you, your brothers will praise you; your hand will be on the neck of your enemies. Your father's sons will bow down to you. A lion's cub is Judah; from the plunder you have gone 
up, my son. He crouched, he lay down like a lion, and like an old lion; who will rouse him? The sceptre will not be removed from Judah, or a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh comes; and to 
him will be the obedience of the peoples. He binds his young ass to the vine, and the foal of his she-ass to the outstanding vine; he washes his clothing in wine, and his garment in the blood of grapes. 
His eyes are red from wine, and his teeth white from milk. </p>
<p>'Judah are you' means the celestial Church, in the highest sense the Lord's Divine celestial. 'Your brothers will praise you' means that 
this Church is superior to all the rest. 'Your hand will be on the neck of your enemies' means that the hellish and devilish crew will flee from its presence. 'Your father's sons will bow down to you' 
means that truths will submit themselves of their own accord. 'A lion's cub is Judah' means innocence with innate strength. 'From the plunder you have gone up, my son' means that through the celestial 
the Lord accomplishes the deliverance of many from hell. 'He crouched, he lay down like a lion, and like an old lion' means the good of love and the truth from that good in their power. 'Who will 
rouse him?' means that he is safe when among all those in the hells. 'The sceptre will not be removed from Judah' means that power and control will not depart from the celestial kingdom. 'Or a lawgiver 
from between his feet' means truths from that kingdom in lower things. 'Until Shiloh comes' means the Lord's Coming, and the peaceful tranquillity at that time. 'And to him will be the obedience of 
the peoples' means that from His Divine Human truths would go forth that were able to be received.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> 'He binds his young ass to the vine' means truth in the natural for the external Church. 'And the foal 
of his she-ass to the outstanding vine' means truth from the rational for the internal Church. 'He washes his clothing in wine' means that His Natural consists in Divine Truth from His Divine Good. 
'And his garment in the blood of grapes' means that His Intellect consists in Divine Good from His Divine Love. 'His eyes are red from wine' means that His Intellect or Internal Human is nothing else 
than good. 'And his teeth white from milk' means that the Divine Natural is nothing else than the good of truth.

Vers. 8-12.  Jehudah tu, celebrabunt te fratres tui, manus tua in cervice hostium tuorum; incurvabunt se tibi filii patris tui.  Catulus leonis Jehudah, a praeda, fili mi, ascendisti; curvavit se, cubuit 
sicut leo, et sicut leo vetulus, quis suscitabit eum?  Non removebitur sceptrum (c)a Jehudah, et legislator ab inter pedes ejus, usque dum venit Shiloh, et ei oboedientia populorum.  Alligat ad 
vitem asellum suum, et ad vitem praestantem filium asinae suae, lavat in vino vestimentum suum, et in sanguine uvarum velamen suum.  (x)Ruber oculis a vino, et albus dentibus a lacte.  `Jehudah tu' significat 
Ecclesiam caelestem, in supremo sensu Dominum quoad Divinum caeleste:  `celebrabunt te fratres tui' significat quod illa Ecclesia prae reliquis eminens sit:  `manus tua in cervice hostium tuorum' 
significat quod infernalis et diabolica turba ad praesentiam aufugient: `incurvabunt se tibi filii patris tui' significat quod vera se submittent ex se:  `catulus leonis Jehudah' significat innocentiam 
cum viribus {1} innatis:  `a praeda fili mi, ascendisti' significat quod a Domino per caeleste liberatio plurium ab inferno:  `curvavit se, cubuit sicut leo, et sicut leo vetulus' significat bonum 
amoris et verum inde in sua potentia:  `quis suscitabit eum?' significat quod tutus sit inter omnes in infernis:  `non removebitur sceptrum a Jehudah' significat quod non potestas recedet a (x)regno 
caelesti: `et legislator ab inter pedes ejus' significat vera quae ab illo in inferioribus:  usque dum venit Shiloh' significat Adventum Domini, et tunc tranquillum pacis:  `et ei oboedientia populorum' 
significat quod a Divino Humano Ipsius procedent vera: `alligat ad vitem asellum suum significat verum in naturali pro Ecclesia externa:  `et ad vitem praestantem filium asinae suae' significat 
quod verum e rationali pro Ecclesia interna:  `lavat in vino vestimentum suum' significat quod naturale Ipsius sit Divinum Verum ex Divino Bono Ipsius:  `et in sanguine uvarum velamen suum' significat 
quod Intellectuale Ipsius sit Divinum Bonum ex Divino Amore Ipsius:  `ruber oculis {2}prae vino' significat quod Intellectuale seu Internum Humanum non sit nisi bonum:  `et albus dentibus a lacte' significat 
quod Divinum Naturale non sit nisi quam bonum veri. @1 A here i ei$ @2 So A I here only; p. 565 and n. 6379 A has prae changed to a$ </p>
