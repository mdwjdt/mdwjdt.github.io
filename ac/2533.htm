<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2533节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>2533．“现在你要把那男人的妻子还给他”表他要交出未经理性玷污的教义的属灵真理。这从“妻子”和“男人”的含义清楚可知：“妻子”是指属灵真理（参看<a href="2507.htm">2507</a>，<a href="2510.htm">2510</a>节）；“男人”是指教义本身。事实上，亚伯拉罕代表处于这种状态下的主，他被称为“男人”时，表示属天的真理，属天的真理与来自属天源头的教义是一样的；因为“男人”的内义表示心智的理解力部分（参看<a href="158.htm">158</a>，<a href="265.htm">265</a>，<a href="749.htm">749</a>，<a href="915.htm">915</a>，<a href="1007.htm">1007</a>，<a href="2517.htm">2517</a>节）。由此明显可知“把那男人的妻子还给他”表交出未玷污的教义的属灵真理。之所以说未经理性玷污，是因为被要求归还她的“亚比米勒”表关注理性事物的教义，或也可说，表构成教义的理性事物（<a href="2510.htm">2510</a>节）。<br />前面说明，尽管信之教义本身是神性，因此超出所有人，甚至超出天使的理解，但在圣言中，它仍根据人的理解力以理性的方式被表述出来。此中情形和教育小男孩、小女孩的父母是一样的：在施教时，他会根据他们自己的思维状态解释每一件事，即便他本人从更深层或更高层进行思考。否则，他只是在施教，而他们没有在学习，或就像把种子丢到岩石上。这也适用于来世教导心思简单者的天使。天使尽管拥有属天和属灵的智慧，但不会上到所教导的那些人的头顶上，而是用简单的观念和他们交谈，不过，会随着教导的深入进行而逐渐上升。若他们通过天使的智慧说话，简单人根本理解不了，因而无法被引至信的真理与良善。若主在圣言中不根据人的理解力以理性的方式来教导，情形也一样。然而，就其内义而言，圣言被提升至天使的理解力。但即便如此，天使所领悟圣言含义的最高层，仍无限低于神性。这表明就其来源而言，圣言是何性质，因而它本身是何性质。因此，圣言处处，甚至一笔一划所包含的事物，比整个天使所能理解的还要多，尽管它在字面上显得如此平凡和粗糙。<br />主就是圣言，因为圣言源于主，主就在圣言里面。这一事实清楚可见于约翰福音：<br />太初有道，道与神同在，道就是神。生命在祂里头，这生命就是人的光。道成了肉身，住在我们中间，我们也见过他的荣光，正是父独生子的荣光，充充满满地有恩典，有真理。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.4.htm">4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">14</a>）<br />也可参看启示录（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.11.htm">19:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.16.htm">16</a>）。主就是圣言，故也是教义，因为本身为神性的其它教义并不存在。</p>

And now restore the man's wife. That this signifies that he should render up the spiritual truth of doctrine without taint from the rational, is evident from the signification of "wife," as being spiritual 
truth (see n. 2507, 2510); and from the signification of the "man," as being doctrine itself; for Abraham (by whom the Lord in that state is represented), when called a "man," signifies celestial 
truth, which is the same as doctrine from a celestial origin; for in the internal sense a "man" is the intellectual (see n. 158, 265, 749, 915, 1007, 2517). Hence it is evident that to "restore the 
man's wife" is to render up the spiritual truth of doctrine without taint. That it means without taint from the rational, is because Abimelech, who was to restore her, signifies doctrine that has regard 
to rational things, or what is the same, the rational things of doctrine (n. 2510). [2] It was said above that although the doctrine of faith is in itself Divine, and therefore above all human and 
even angelic comprehension, it has nevertheless been dictated in the Word according to man's comprehension, in a rational manner. The case herein is the same as it is with a parent who is teaching his 
little boys and girls: when he is teaching, he sets forth everything in accordance with their genius, although he himself thinks from what is more interior or higher; otherwise it would be teaching 
without their learning, or like casting seed upon a rock. The case is also the same with the angels who in the other life instruct the simple in heart: although these angels are in celestial and spiritual 
wisdom, yet they do not hold themselves above the comprehension of those whom they teach, but speak in simplicity with them, yet rising by degrees as these are instructed; for if they were to speak 
from angelic wisdom, the simple would comprehend nothing at all, and thus would not be led to the truths and goods of faith. The case would be the same if the Lord had not taught in the Word in accordance 
with man's comprehension, in a rational manner. Nevertheless in its internal sense the Word is elevated to the angelic understanding; and yet that sense, in its highest elevation in which it 
is perceived by the angels, is infinitely below the Divine. It is hence manifest what the Word is in its origin, and thus in itself; and that it thus everywhere involves more things than the whole heaven 
is capable of comprehending, even as to a small part, although in the letter it appears so unimportant and so rude. [3] That the Lord is the Word, because the Word is from Him and He is in the Word, 
is evident in John: </p>
<p>     In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word; in Him was life, and the life was the light of men; the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among 
us; and we saw His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth (John 1:1, 4, 14; see also Rev. 19:11, 13, 16). And as the Lord is the Word, He is also doctrine; 
for there is no other doctrine which is itself Divine. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2533</b></p><p><b>2533.</b>
That 'now return the man's wife' means that the spiritual truth of doctrine was by him to be brought back untouched from the rational is clear from the meaning of 'a wife' as spiritual truth, dealt with 
in <a href="2507.htm">2507</a>, <a href="2510.htm">2510</a>, and from the meaning of 'a man' as doctrine itself. Actually when Abraham who represents the Lord in that state is called 'a man' he means celestial truth, which is the same as doctrine 
from a celestial origin; for 'man' in the internal sense means the understanding part of the mind, see <a href="158.htm">158</a>, <a href="265.htm">265</a>, <a href="749.htm">749</a>, <a href="915.htm">915</a>, <a href="1007.htm">1007</a>, <a href="2517.htm">2517</a>. From this it is evident that 'resuming the man's wife' means 
bringing back the spiritual truth of doctrine untouched. Its being brought back untouched from the rational is meant because 'Abimelech' who was required to return her means doctrine that has regard 
to rational things, or what amounts to the same, means the rational things comprising doctrine, <a href="2510.htm">2510</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It has been stated above that although the doctrine of faith is in itself Divine and so stands 
above all human, even angelic, range of understanding, it has nevertheless been expressed in the Word in a rational manner in accordance with man's range of understanding. It is like a parent who 
is teaching small boys and girls. When teaching them he explains every single thing in accordance with their own mentality, even though he himself thinks from what is more interior or higher. Otherwise 
he would be teaching without their learning, or it would be like casting seed on bare rock. The same applies also to the angels who in the next life instruct the simple in heart. Although the angels 
possess celestial and spiritual wisdom they nevertheless do not go above the heads of those they are teaching but use simple ideas to talk to them, yet advance by degrees to higher ideas as the instruction 
advances. For if they were to speak from angelic wisdom the simple would not grasp anything at all and so would not be led on to the truths and goods of faith. Much the same would happen if in 
the Word the Lord had not taught in a rational manner in accordance with man's range of understanding. Nevertheless in its internal sense the Word is raised up to angelic understanding. But even so, that 
highest level of meaning on which the Word exists with angels is infinitely lower than the Divine. This shows what the Word is like in origin, and so what it is in itself, and thus that at every point 
it embodies more than the whole of heaven is capable of comprehending, even as to one small part, though in the letter it seems so ordinary and so crude. </p>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 The fact that the Lord is the Word, 
because the Word derives from Him and He is in the Word, is clear in John, </p>
<blockquote>
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. In Him was life, and the life was the light 
of men. The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, glory as of the Only Begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:-1,%204,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:-1, 4, 14</a>.

</blockquote>
And because the Lord is the Word, He is doctrine also, for no other doctrine exists which is itself Divine. </p>

Quod `nunc reduc uxorem viri' significet quod spirituale verum doctrinae immune redderet a rationali, constat a significatione `uxoris' quod sit spirituale verum, de qua n. (x)2507, 2510: et a significatione 
`viri' quod sit ipsa doctrina, `Abrahamus' enim per quem Dominus in illo statu repraesentatur cum nominatur `vir,' {1} significat caeleste verum, quod idem est ac doctrina ex origine caelesti, 
nam `vir' in sensu interno est intellectuale, videatur n. 158, 265, 749, 915 1007, 2517; inde patet quod `reducere uxorem viri' sit spirituale verum doctrinae immune reddere; quod sit a rationali, 
est quia `Abimelechus qui reduceret, significat doctrinam spectantem rationalia, seu quod idem, rationalia doctrinae, n. 2510.  [2] Supra dictum quod tametsi doctrina fidei in se est {2} Divina, et sic 
supra omnem captum humanum, etiam angelicum, usque tamen in Verbo secundum captum hominis rationali modo dictata est; hoc se habet sicut parens, qui docet infantes pueros et puellas, is cum docet, exponit 
omnia et singula secundum genium {3} eorum, tametsi is ex interiore aut altiore cogitat, alioquin foret docere quod non discitur, aut sicut projicere semen in petram: etiam sicut {4} angeli qui 
in altera vita instruunt simplices corde; tametsi angeli in sapientia caelesti et spirituali sunt, usque tamen non supra captum eorum quos docent, se elevant, sed loquuntur simpliciter cum illis, at 
assurgendo per gradus sicut instruuntur; si enim ex angelica sapientia loquerentur, simplices ne hilum caperent, ita nec ducerentur ad vera et bona fidei; similiter foret si Dominus non secundum captum 
hominis rationali modo in Verbo docuisset; sed usque Verbum est elevatum ad intellectum angelicum in sensu ejus interno; at tamen in summa illa elevatione, in qua est coram angelis, est infinite infra 
Divinum; inde patet quoque Verbum est in sua origine, (c)ac sic in se, ac ita quod plura ubivis involvat quam universum caelum quoad parum ejus capax sit comprehendere, tametsi tam leve et tam rude 
apparet in littera.  [3] Quod Dominus sit Verbum, quia ab Ipso Verbum et Ipse in Verbo, constat apud Johannem, 	In principio erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum; in Ipso vita 
erat, et vita erat lux hominum:... Verbum caro factam est, et habitavit in nobis, et vidimus gloriam Ipsius, gloriam sicut unigeniti a Patre, plenus gratia et veritate, i 1, 4, 14; </p>
<p>videatur etiam Apoc. 
xix 11, 13, 16; et quia Dominus est Verbum, etiam est doctrina, nam alia doctrina, quae est ipsa Divina, non datur. 	@1 i tunc.$ 	@2 sit AI.$ 	@3 i captum et.$ 	@ et sicut etiam.$ </p>
