<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1116节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1116.</strong>我见过属上古教会第二代和第三代后裔之人的居所。这些居所非常宏伟，绵延千里，因着亮红和湛蓝的美丽色彩而各式各样。事实上，天使的居所是最壮观的，无法形容，我经常看到它们。在天使眼里，其居所如此真实，以致再没有比这更真实的了。至于这些表象如此真实的源由，蒙主怜悯，容后再述。可以说，他们生活在珍珠般的璀璨光环中，有时生活在钻石般的光环中。因为来世有着变化无穷的奇妙光环。人若以为那里不存在这类事物，就大错特错了。这些事物数量之多，无限超出任何人所曾有或所能有的任何想象。诚然，它们是象征物，如同先知有时所见之物那样，但它们如此真实，以致在来世的人都视之为真实的，世间的事物相对来说则是不真实的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1116.</strong> I was shown the houses of the people who belonged to the second and third generations of this earliest church, and they are magnificent. They are very long, and each displays various beautiful shades of deep red and of blue.<br />Angels have houses that are simply glorious — so glorious that words could never describe them. I have seen these houses many times. They appear so vividly before the sight of their inhabitants that nothing could strike the eyes more vividly; but the reason why the visual experience is so intense will be explained later [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1116/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1619" target=_top>1619-1633</a>], in the Lord's divine mercy.<br />They live in an aura of pearly light (so to speak) and sometimes in one of diamondlike radiance. In the next life, countless different varieties of atmosphere exist, and they are incredible. People are seriously mistaken if they do not consider such things possible there, and infinitely more of them than anyone ever has been or ever will be able to picture. It is true that these things exist as representations, as did some of the sights the prophets saw, but they are so vivid that they are completely real to the inhabitants of the next world and make the objects of this world seem unreal by comparison. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1116</b></p><p><b>1116.</b>
Dwellings were shown me of those who were of the second and third posterities of this Most Ancient Church. They are magnificent, extending to a great length, and diversified with beautiful colors of 
bright crimson and azure blue. For the angels have most magnificent dwellings, such as cannot be described, as I have often seen. To their eyes so real is their appearance that nothing can be more real. 
But whence such real appearances come will be shown of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. They live in an aura, so to speak, of resplendent pearly and sometimes of diamond-like light. For there are 
wonderful auras in the other life, of inexpressible variety. They greatly err who do not believe that such things exist there, and indefinitely more than anyone ever could or can conceive. They are indeed 
representative, like the things sometimes seen by the prophets; but yet are so real that they who are in the other life hold them to be real, and the things which are in the world to be relatively unreal. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1116</b></p><p><b>1116.</b>
I have been shown the dwelling-places of those who belonged to the second and third generations of the descendants of this Most Ancient Church. Those dwelling-places are magnificent, stretching out a 
long way and varying in beautiful shades of red and blue. In fact angels have most magnificent dwelling- places defying description, which I have seen many times. To their eyes they appear so real that 
no appearance could ever be more real. The origin of these appearances that are so real will in the Lord's Divine mercy be discussed later on. They live in a radiance of light, so to speak, of bright 
pearl, and sometimes like that of diamonds, for in the next life wonderful radiances exist in endless variety. People are much mistaken who imagine that such things do not exist there - things unendingly 
more numerous than those that anyone could or can conceive. They are, it is true, representatives like those sometimes seen by the prophets; but to those who are in the next life these representatives 
are nevertheless so real that they regard them as realities, and the things belonging to this world by comparison as non-realities. </p>

</p><b>1116.</b>
Ostensa mihi fuerunt habitacula illorum qui a posteritate altera et tertia Antiquissimae hujus Ecclesiae fuerunt, quae sunt magnifica, extensa in multam longitudinem, variegata pulchris coloribus, purpureis 
et caeruleis:  sunt enim habitacula angelis magnificentissima ut nusquam describi possint, quae multoties vidi, coram oculis illorum tam vive apparentia ut nihil ad vivum apparentius dari queat; 
sed unde tales apparentiae ad vivum, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus.  Vivunt in aura lucis, ut ita dicam, splendentis margariticae, et quandoque in adamantinae; nam in altera vita aurae 
mirabiles cum innumerabili varietate dantur; qui putant non talia ibi dari, et indefinite plura quam quae usquam in alicujus ideam pervenire potuerunt aut possunt, aut possunt, ii multum falluntur; 
sunt quidem repraesentativa qualia quandoque prophetis visa sunt, sed usque ita realia ut qui in altera vita sunt, illa pro realibus habeant, at ea quae in mundo respective pro non realibus. </p>
