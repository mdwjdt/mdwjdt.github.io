<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第95节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>95.</strong>此处所描述的是人外在的活力，其中前两节描述的是信（亦即觉性）的活力，本节描述的是爱（亦即意志）的活力。此前，外在不愿服从内在，时常与之交战。彼时，其外在尚称不上“人”。当下，由于成了属天之人，其外在开始服从内在，凭信与爱的活力而成了“人”。信的活力使他得到预备，爱的活力使他成为“人”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]95.</strong> The subject here is life in the outer self. While the two preceding verses deal with the life in our faith or intellect, the present one deals with the life in the love we feel, or in our will.<br />So far our outer being has not wanted to obey or serve the inner but has instead kept up a battle with it, so during this time the outer being has not been human. Now, though, when we have taken on a heavenly nature, our outer self is beginning to offer some obedience and service to the inner self and is becoming human, through a living faith and vibrant love. A living faith prepares us to be human; a vibrant love makes us so. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 95</b></p><p><b>95.</b>
The life of the external man is here treated of-the life of his faith or understanding in the two former verses, and the life of his love or will in this verse. Hitherto the external man has been unwilling 
to yield to and serve the internal, being engaged in a continual combat with him, and therefore the external man was not then "man." Now, however, being made celestial, the external man begins 
to obey and serve the internal, and it also becomes "man" being so rendered by the life of faith and the life of love. The life of faith prepares him, but it is the life of love which causes him to be "man." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 95</b></p><p><b>95.</b>
The subject here is the life of the external man. In the two previous verses it was the life of his faith or understanding, now in this verse the life of his love or will. Previously the external man 
was not willing to comply with or serve the internal but constantly struggled against it, and so the external man at that time was not man. But now that he has become celestial the external man starts 
to comply with and serve the internal, and becomes man as well - in particular through the life inherent in faith and the life inherent in love. The life of faith prepares him to be man, while the life 
of love actually makes him so.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 95</b>
</p><b>95.</b>
Agitur hic de vita hominis externi, in binis prioribus versibus de vita ejus fidei seu intellectus, in hoc de vita ejus amoris seu voluntatis: prius externus homo non obsequi et servire voluit interno 
sed continue pugnavit contra illum, quare tunc externus non fuit homo; nunc autem cum factus caelestis, externus incipit obsequia praestare et servire interno, et fit quoque homo, et quidem per vitam 
fidei et vitam amoris; vita fidei praeparat eum, vita amoris facit ut sit homo.
