<h4 align="center"></h4><p>694．源自主的天堂通过相爱可以说构成一个人和一个灵魂，因而关注一个目标，就是保护和拯救所有人，直到永远；而另一方面，源自人的自我中心的地狱，则通过我欲（self-love）和物欲（love of the world），即通过恨构成一个魔鬼和一种心态，因而也关注一个目标，就是毁灭和诅咒所有人，直到永远。这就是他们努力的性质，对此，我已经觉察到了成千上万次。因此，若非主时时刻刻保护每个人，人必要灭亡。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]694.</strong> By the Lord's arrangement and through mutual love, heaven forms a single human being with a single animating soul, so it looks toward a single goal: the preservation and salvation of all to eternity. In contrast, hell, out of its sense of autonomy and through self-love and materialism — through hatred, in other words — forms a single devil with a single animus, so it looks toward a single goal: the destruction and damnation of all to eternity. Thousands and thousands of times have I experienced the whole effort of hell as turning in this direction. If the Lord, then, did not preserve us all, every single solitary moment, we would be snuffed out. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 694</b></p><p><b>694.</b>
As heaven from the Lord, through mutual love, constitutes as it were one man, and one soul, and thus has regard to one end, which is the conservation and salvation of all to eternity, so, on the other 
hand, hell, from man's Own, through the love of self and of the world, that is, through hatred, constitutes one devil and one mind [animus], and thus also has regard to one end, which is the destruction 
and damnation of all to eternity. That such is their endeavor has been perceived thousands and thousands of times, so that unless the Lord preserved all every instant, they would perish. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 694</b></p><p><b>694.</b>
Just as heaven, deriving as it does from the Lord, constitutes through mutual love one human being and one soul so to speak, and consequently has one end in view, which is to preserve and save all men 
eternally, so conversely does hell, deriving as it does from the proprium, constitute through self-love and love of the world, that is, through hatred, one devil and one frame of mind (animus), and 
consequently has one end in view, which is to destroy and condemn all men eternally. That this is the nature of their endeavours I have perceived thousands and thousands of times. Unless therefore the 
Lord were preserving everybody in every fraction of a moment, man would perish. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 694</b>
</p><b>694.</b>
Sicut caelum a Domino, per amorem mutuum, unum quasi hominem et unam animam constituit, ac ita unum finem spectat, qui est ad conservandum et salvandum omnes in aeternum; ita contra, infernum a proprio, 
per amorem sui et mundi, hoc est, per odium, unum diabolum et unum animum constituit, ac ita unum finem spectat, qui est ad perdendum et damnandum omnes in aeternum; conatus eorum, quod talis, millies 
et millies perceptus; quare nisi Dominus singulis momentis, etiam omnium minimis, conservaret omnes, perirent. </p>
