<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4525节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4525.</strong>从这一切明显可知，人里面的一切事物尤其具有与灵界的一种对应关系，若没有这种对应关系，他甚至无法存留片刻；因为没有对应关系，就没有来自生命存在，也就是主的持续之物，因而缺乏联系；缺乏联系就会消散为虚无。与人的对应关系之所以更直接、更密切，是因为人被造是为了他能将从主所流入的生命用到自己身上，从而在其思维和情感方面被造，具有被主提升至自然界之上的能力，由此思想神并因着对神性的一种情感而被打动，进而与祂联结，和地上的其它生物截然不同。当脱去这个世界的肉体事物时，那些具有这种与神性联结能力的人不会死亡，因为他们的内在与祂保持联结。</p>

From all this it is evident that with man especially there is a correspondence of all things with the spiritual world, and that without this correspondence he cannot subsist even for a moment; for without 
correspondence there would be nothing continuous from the very being of life, that is, from the Lord; thus there would be what is unconnected; and what is unconnected is dissipated as a nothing. 
The reason why correspondence with man is more immediate and hence closer, is that he has been created to apply to himself the life from the Lord, and thence into the capacity of a possible elevation 
by the Lord above the natural world in regard to his thoughts and affections, and thereby to think of God and to be affected with the Divine, and thus to be conjoined with Him, quite differently from 
the lower animals. And when the bodily things of this world are put away, those die not who are thus capable of being conjoined with the Divine, because their interiors remain conjoined with Him. </p>

From all this it is evident that in man in particular everything has a correspondence with the spiritual world, and that without this correspondence he cannot remain in being for a single moment; for 
without correspondence nothing continuous from the very Being of life, that is, from the Lord, could have any existence. Thus lack of connection would exist, leading so to speak to dissolution into nothingness. 
The reason why the correspondence with man is more immediate and consequently more exact is that he has been created so that he may take to himself life flowing from the Lord, and so has been 
created, as regards his thoughts and affections, with the capacity to be raised up by the Lord above the natural world, as a consequence to have thoughts about God, to be moved by an affection for 
the Divine, and thereby to be joined to Him, unlike other living creatures on earth. Beings who have this capacity to be joined to the Divine do not die when everything of the body belonging to this 
world is laid aside, for interiorly those beings remain joined to him. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 4525</b>
</p><b>4525.</b>
Ex his patet quod imprimis apud hominem omnium correspondentia sit cum mundo spirituali, et quod absque illa correspondentia ne quidem momento subsistere possit, nam absque correspondentia nihil 
continuum foret ab Ipso Esse vitae, hoc est, a Domino, ita inconnexum, et inconnexum sicut nullum dissipatur.  Quod correspondentia apud hominem immediatior et inde strictior sit, est quia creatus 
est ad sibi applicandum vitam Domino (c)et inde in quoad cogitationes et quoad affectiones a Domino elevari possit supra mundum naturalem, (c)et inde cogitare de Deo et affici Divino, illi Ipsi; secus 
ac animantia terrae; et qui ita conjungi possunt Divino, illi non moriuntur quando corporea quae sunt mundi, separantur, interiora enim conjuncta manent. </p>
