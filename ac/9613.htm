<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9613节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9613.</strong>“这才成了一个居所”表整个天堂由此完全合而为一。这从“居所”的含义清楚可知，“居所”是指天堂（参看<a href="9594.htm">9594</a>节）。当天堂被如此完全联结起来时，它就为一，这是显而易见的。因为天堂是由无数天使社群组成的，然而主引导他们如同引导一个总的天使或人。这是因为源于主之爱的相爱就存在于他们所有人当中，当这爱存在于他们所有人当中，在他们所有人里面时，他们就能被排列成天堂的形式，该形式具有这样的性质：许多人合而为一，而且他们人数越多，他们的一体性就越强。此处情形就像人体的无数部位，尽管这些部位截然不同，各种各样，但仍构成一体。原因是，它们都存在于一个类似天堂的形式里面，因为它们与天堂相对应，这在许多章节末尾早已说明；他们凭这种对应而拥有一种相爱，并通过相爱而联结在一起。正因如此，一个处于爱和信的良善之人是一个最小形式的天堂（<a href="9279.htm">9279</a>节）；在主眼里，整个天堂如同一个总的人（参看<a href="9276.htm">9276</a>e节）。<br />天堂里不计其数的天使社群的一切联结，以及它们的联结方式就以本章所论述的居所和罩棚的建造来代表。不过，联结的这些方式，就是诸如存在于天堂中的这些方式，无法从那里进入世人所拥有的观念，因为世人甚至没有意识到这一事实：“居所”代表天堂。或者他们即便意识到这一事实，仍不知道天上的社群通过爱被如此联结在一起，以致它们呈现为一体。然而，当关于居所的这些细节被阅读时，所有这些事物都完全流入天使的观念；因为所描述的每一个具体细节都有一个内义，当被主显现给天使时，这内义就会将整个天堂中的所有人通过来自主的爱而彼此联结、互相关联的状态展现给他们。<br />天使社群按照以下法则合为一个天堂：⑴天堂里的每一个完整整体都是由许多人按照天堂的和谐而彼此分享生活的模式产生的。⑵爱是属灵的融合，这种融合带来天堂的和谐。⑶为使一切个体都能被保持在结合和关联中，必须有一个共同的纽带。⑷共同的纽带必进入并创造个体纽带。⑸这共同的纽带就是主，也就是来自主的爱，因而对祂的爱。⑹个体纽带就来源于这共同纽带；它们是相爱，或对邻之仁的纽带。这些就是由无数天使社群组成的天堂仍作为一个总的人而存在所凭借的法则。</p>

And it shall be one Habitation. That this signifies the whole heaven thus altogether one, is evident from the signification of "the Habitation," as being heaven (see n. 9594). That heaven is one when 
it is so conjoined, is manifest; for heaven consists of myriads of angelic societies, and yet the Lord leads them as one angel, or as one man. The reason of this is that among all there is mutual love 
from the love of the Lord. When this love is among all, and in all, then all can be disposed into a heavenly form, which is such that many are a one, and the more in number they are, the more strongly 
they are a one. The case herein is like that of the countless things in the human body, which, though distinct and various, yet make a one. The reason is that they are in a form like that of heaven, 
for the two correspond, as has been shown at the end of many chapters; and from this correspondence they are in mutual love, and in this way are conjoined. Hence it is that the man who is in the good 
of love and of faith is a heaven in the least form (n. 9279); and that before the Lord the whole heaven is as one man (see n. 9276). [2] All the conjunction of the countless angelic societies in heaven, 
together with the methods of their conjunction, was represented in the form of the construction of the Habitation and of the Tent, as treated of in this chapter. But these methods of conjunction, 
such as they are in heaven, cannot come from this to a man's idea, for the reason that man does not even know that heaven was represented by the Habitation; and even if he knew this, still he does not 
know that the heavenly societies have been so joined together by means of love as to represent a one. But all these things flow fully into the idea of the angels, when these things relating to the 
Habitation are read; for each and all things of the description have an internal sense, which when made manifest by the Lord before the angels, exhibits the state of conjunction together, by means of 
the love which is from the Lord, of all in the universal heaven. [3] The conjunction of the angelic societies into one heaven has reference to these laws: 1. Everyone in the form of the heavens comes 
forth in accordance with the heavenly harmony of many associated together. 2. Love is spiritual conjunction, whence comes heavenly harmony. 3. There must be a universal bond, in order that all the individuals 
may be held together in conjunction. 4. The universal bond must flow into the individual bonds, and must make them. 5. The universal bond is the Lord, thus love from Him, and consequently love 
to Him. 6. The individual bonds are derived from this, and are those of mutual love, or of charity toward the neighbor. These are the laws by virtue of which heaven, consisting of innumerable angelic 
societies, is nevertheless as one man. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9613</b></p><p><b>9613.</b>
'And the dwelling-place shall be one' means that the whole heaven is as a result altogether one. This is clear from the meaning of 'the dwelling-place' as heaven, dealt with in <a href="9594.htm">9594</a>. The fact that it 
is one when it is so completely joined together is self-evident. For heaven consists of tens of thousands of angelic communities, and yet the Lord leads them as one total angel or man. This is so because 
mutual love springing from the Lord's love exists among them all, and when that love exists among them all and within them all they can all be arranged into the heavenly form, the nature of which 
is such that many are one, and the more numerous they are, the stronger is their oneness. They are like the countless parts of the human body; although these are distinct and various they nevertheless 
make one. The reason why they do so is that they exist within a form similar to that in which heaven exists; for they correspond to heaven, as has been shown at the ends of a number of chapters, and 
by virtue of that correspondence they possess a kind of mutual love and are joined together by it. So it is that a person who is governed by the good of love and faith is heaven in its smallest form, <a href="9279.htm">9279</a>, and that the whole of heaven is seen in the Lord's eyes as one total human being, <a href="9276.htm">9276</a> (end).  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 All the joining together of so many countless angelic communities in heaven and the modes by 
which they are joined were represented by the pattern according to which the dwelling-place and the tent, the subject in the present chapter, were assembled. But the modes by which things are joined 
together, as those modes exist in heaven, cannot pass from there into the ideas people in the world have, because they are not even aware of the fact that heaven was represented by 'the dwelling-place'. 
Or if they were aware of it they would still be unaware that heavenly communities have been so joined together by means of love that they present themselves as one. Yet all such considerations enter 
fully into angels' ideas when those details regarding the dwelling-place are read; for each specific detail in the description has an inner meaning, which, when manifested by the Lord to angels, presents 
to them the state in which all in the whole of heaven are joined to and interconnected with one another by means of love which comes from the Lord.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The combination of the angelic communities 
into one heaven takes place in accord with the following laws,  </p>
<p><a href="1.htm">1</a> Every complete whole in heaven arises from the pattern of many sharing their lives with one another in accord with the harmony 
of heaven.  <a href="2.htm">2</a> Love is spiritual togetherness, which leads to the harmony of heaven.  <a href="3.htm">3</a> There must be a universal bond, in order that the individual constituents may be held in combination and interconnection. 
 <a href="4.htm">4</a> The universal bond must enter into and create the individual bonds.  <a href="5.htm">5</a> The universal bond is the Lord, that is, it is the love that comes from Him, and from this the love directed towards 
Him.  <a href="6.htm">6</a> The individual bonds are derived from the universal; they are the bonds of mutual love or charity towards the neighbour.  </p>
<p>These are the laws by virtue of which heaven, consisting of 
countless angelic communities, nevertheless exists as one total human being.  </p>

`Et erit habitaculum unum': quod significet totum caelum ita prorsus unum, constat ex significatione `habitaculi' quod sit caelum, de qua n. 9594; quod unum sit cum ita conjunctum, patet; caelum enim 
{1} ex myriadibus societatum angelicarum consistit, et usque Dominus illos {2} sicut unum angelum seu unum hominem ducit; quod ita sit, est causa quia inter omnes est amor mutuus ex amore Domini; cum 
ille amor est inter omnes et in omnibus, tunc omnes possunt disponi in formam caelestem, quae talis est ut plures unum sint, et quo plures eo fortius {3} unum.  Similiter se habet hoc sicut cum innumerabilibus 
in corpore humano, quae tametsi distincta sunt et varia, usque unum faciunt; causa est quia in simili forma sunt in qua caelum, correspondent enim {4}, ut ad finem plurium capitum ostensum 
est; et ex correspondentia in {5} mutuo amore sunt, et sic conjuncta; inde est quod homo qui in bono amoris et fidei est sit caelum in minima forma, n. 9279; et (x)quod totum caelum coram Domino sit 
sicut unus homo, n. 9276 fin. 	[2] Omnis conjunctio tam innumerabilium societatum angelicarum in caelo, cum modis conjunctionis earum, repraesentata est in forma constructionis habitaculi ac tentorii, 
de quibus in hoc capite; sed modi conjunctionis, quales in caelo, non inde ad ideam hominis pervenire possunt, ex causa quia homo ne, quidem scit quod per habitaculum repraesentatum (x)sit caelum; et 
si (o)id scivisset, usque non scit quod societates caelestes ita per amorem conjunctae sint ut unum referant; sed omnia illa plene in angelorum ideam influunt cum haec de habitaculo leguntur, omnia 
enim et singula descriptionis sensum internum habent, qui a Domino coram angelis manifestatus sistit statum conjunctionis omnium totius caeli inter se per amorem qui a Domino. 	[3] Conjunctio societatum 
angelicarum in unum caelum se refert ad has leges, 	1. Quod omne unum in caelo {6} forma plurium secundum harmoniam caelestem consociatorum existat. 	2.  Quod amor sit conjunctio spiritualis, unde 
harmonia caelestis. 	3.  Quod vinculum universale erit, ut singula inter se teneantur conjuncta. 	4.  Quod vinculum universale influet in vincula singularia, et faciet illa. 	5.  Quod vinculum universale 
sit Dominus ita amor ab Ipso, et inde amor in ipsum. 	6.  {7} Quod vincula singularia sint inde, et quod illa sint amoris mutui seu {8} charitatis erga proximum. 	Hae leges {9} sunt a quibus 
caelum ex innumerabilibus societatibus angelicis consistens usque ut unus homo sit. @1 etiam$ @2 i omnes$ @3 magis$ @4 i coelo$ @5 i quodam$ @6 coelorum IT$ @7 i et$ @8 d seu i et$ @9 i ordinis$ </p>
