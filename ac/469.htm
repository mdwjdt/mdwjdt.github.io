<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>469.</strong>创世记5:1 这是亚当的族谱。当神造（creat）人的日子，是照着神的样式做（make）的。<br />“族谱”记录了属上古教会之人；“当神造（creat）人的日子”表示他被造为属灵；“照着自己的样式做（make）的”表示他被造为属天。因此，这描述的是上古教会。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]469.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_469/bible_king-james-version_genesis_5_1" target=_top>Genesis 5:1</a>. This is the book of the births of the human, on the day on which God created the human; in God's likeness he made the human.<br />The book of births is the enumeration of those who were part of the earliest church. On the day on which God created the human means that the human became spiritual. In God's likeness he made the human means that the human became heavenly. So it is a depiction of the earliest church. </p>

Verse 1. This is the book of the births of Man. In the day that God created Man, in the likeness of God made He him. The "book of the births" is an enumeration of those who were of the Most Ancient Church; 
"in the day that God created Man" denotes his being made spiritual; and "in the likeness of God made He him" signifies that he was made celestial: thus it is a description of the Most Ancient Church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 469</b></p><p><b>469.</b>
Verse 1 This is the book of the generations of Man. On the day in which God created Man, in the likeness of God He made him.  </p>
<p>'The book of the generations' is a record of those who belonged to the 
Most Ancient Church. 'On the day in which God created Man' means his being made spiritual. 'In the likeness of God He made him' means his being made celestial. So it is a description of the Most Ancient Church.  </p>

Vers. 1.  Hic liber nativitatum Hominis, die quo creavit Deus hominem; in similitudinem Dei fecit illum. 'Liber nativitatum' est recensio eorum qui fuerunt ab Ecclesia Antiquissima: 'die quo creavit 
Deus hominem' est quod spiritualis factus: 'in similitudinem Dei fecit illum' est quod caelestis factus: ita est descriptio Ecclesiae Antiquissimae. </p>
