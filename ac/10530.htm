<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10530节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10530</strong>.“上到那流奶与蜜之地”表源于信与爱之良善的愉悦、快乐的感觉。这从“地”、“奶”、“蜜”和“流”的含义清楚可知：“地”是指教会（参看<a href="9325.htm">9325</a>节提到的地方）；“奶”是指属灵良善，也就是信之良善（参看<a href="2184.htm">2184</a>节）；“蜜”是指属天良善，也就是爱之良善；“流”是指充满。“流奶与蜜之地”因表示这些事物，故也表示源于信与爱之良善的愉悦和快乐的感觉（<a href="5620.htm">5620</a>节）。之所以说源于这种良善的“愉悦和快乐的感觉”，是因为信与爱之良善带来真正的天上愉悦和快乐。一切良善都带有自己的快乐，因为“良善”一词就表示被爱之物和一切属于爱的快乐感觉。天堂喜乐和永恒幸福所指的快乐感觉只来源于对真理和良善的爱。这些快乐感觉胜过存在于世上的任何爱的一切快乐，完全不为那些认为一切快乐在于世俗、肉体和尘世事物的人所知。</p>

Unto a land flowing with milk and honey. That this signifies what is pleasant and delightful from the good of faith and of love, is evident from the signification of "land," as being the church (of which 
in the places cited in n. 9325); from the signification of "milk," as being spiritual good, which is the good of faith (see n. 2184); from the signification of "honey," as being celestial good, which 
is the good of love; and from the signification of "flowing," as being to be full. And because these things are signified by "a land flowing with milk and honey," that which is pleasant and delightful 
from the good of faith and of love is also signified (n. 5620). It is said what is pleasant and delightful from these, because heavenly pleasantness and delight itself is in the good of faith and 
of love; for every good has its delight, for that is called good which is loved, and all delight is of love. The delight which is meant by heavenly joy, and by eternal happiness, is from no other source 
than the love of truth and of good. That this delight is superior to any delight of any love whatsoever that is to be found in the world, is quite unknown to those who make all delight to consist 
in worldly, bodily, and earthly things. </p>

'[Go up] to a land flowing with milk and honey' means feelings of pleasure and delight derived from the good of faith and love. This is clear from the meaning of 'a land' as the Church, dealt with in 
the places referred to in <a href="9325.htm">9325</a>; from the meaning of 'milk' as spiritual good, which is the good of faith, dealt with in <a href="2184.htm">2184</a>; from the meaning of 'honey' as celestial good, which is the good of love; 
and from the meaning of 'flowing' as being full. And since these things are meant by 'a land flowing with milk and honey', feelings of pleasure and delight derived from the good of faith and love are 
also meant, see <a href="5620.htm">5620</a>. 'Feelings of pleasure and delight' derived from such good are spoken of because the good of faith and love brings real heavenly pleasure and delight. All good brings its own delight; 
for the word 'good' is used to denote that which is loved, and every feeling of delight owes its existence to love. The feelings of delight meant by heavenly joy and eternal happiness spring from 
nothing other than the love of what is true and good. The superiority of these feelings of delight to all those belonging to any love that exists in the world is completely unknown to those who suppose 
that all delight resides in worldly, bodily, and earthly things.  </p>

`Ad terram fluentem lacte et melle':  quod significet amoenum et jucundum ex bono fidei et amoris, constat (c)a significatione `terrae' quod sit Ecclesia, de qua in locis citatis n. (x)9325, ex significatione 
`lactis' quod sit bonum spirituale, quod est bonum fidei, de qua n. 2184, et ex significatione `mellis' quod sit bonum caeleste, quod est bonum amoris, et ex significatione `fluere' quod sit 
plenum esse; et quia haec significantur per `terram fluentem lacte et melle,' etiam significantur amoenum et jucundum ex bono fidei et amoris, videatur n. 5620; dicitur amoenum et jucundum ex illis, 
quoniam in bono fidei et amoris est ipsum amoenum et jucundum caeleste; omne enim bonum suum jucundum habet, {1}id enim dicitur bonum quod amatur, et omne jucundum est amoris; jucundum quod intelligitur 
per gaudium caeleste et per felicitatem aeternam non aliunde est quam ex amore veri et boni; quod hoc jucundum sit supra omne jucundum cujuscumque amoris in mundo, nesciunt prorsus illi qui omne jucundum 
ponunt in mundanis, corporeis, et terrestribus. @1 bonum enim dicitur$ </p>
