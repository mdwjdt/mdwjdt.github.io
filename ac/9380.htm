<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9380节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9380.</strong>“百姓也不可和他一同上来”表与脱离内在的外在没有任何结合。这从“上来”的含义清楚可知，“上来”是指结合，如前所述（<a href="9373.htm">9373</a>节），在此是指没有结合，因为经上说“不可上来”。它之所以表示与脱离内在意义的圣言外在意义没有结合，是因为此处“百姓”所指的雅各的子孙局限于没有任何内在事物的外在事物（参看<a href="3479.htm">3479</a>，<a href="4281.htm">4281</a>，<a href="4293.htm">4293</a>，<a href="4307.htm">4307</a>，<a href="4429.htm">4429</a>，<a href="4433.htm">4433</a>，<a href="4680.htm">4680</a>，<a href="4844.htm">4844</a>，<a href="4847.htm">4847</a>，<a href="4865.htm">4865</a>，<a href="4868.htm">4868</a>，<a href="4874.htm">4874</a>，<a href="4899.htm">4899</a>，<a href="4903.htm">4903</a>，<a href="4911.htm">4911</a>，<a href="4913.htm">4913</a>，<a href="6304.htm">6304</a>，<a href="8588.htm">8588</a>，<a href="8788.htm">8788</a>，<a href="8806.htm">8806</a>，<a href="8871.htm">8871</a>节）。他们专注于没有任何内在事物的外在事物，这一点从此后四十天，他们就敬拜金牛犊很明显地看出来。他们若同时意识到内在事物，也就是对耶和华的爱和信之良善，就会有不同的行为；因为这良善就是内在之物。那些通过这良善与祂结合的人不可能离开去敬拜一个偶像，因为他们的心远离它。但由于这百姓仅通过外在事物与主结合，他们通过外在事物来代表内在事物，所以经上说“这百姓不可走近”，意思是，与缺乏内在事物的外在事物没有任何结合。没有关于所代表的内层事物的任何知识、信仰和情感的代表会将事物联结起来，但不会将这个人联结起来。<br />这种情况与那些仅持守圣言的字义，根本没有从圣言获得任何教义的人很相似，因为他们与内义分离，而内义是教义本身。主通过圣言的内层事物与圣言的外在事物结合；因此，如果内层事物被分离出去，主与外在事物的结合是不可能的，除非如同和一个与内心不一致的身体姿势结合。这种情况也与那些精通其教会教义的一切细节，却不将它们应用于生活的人很相似。他们也局限于缺乏任何内在事物的外在事物，因为对这些人来说，教义真理若没有铭刻在他们的生命上，就只占据外在位置。主与这些真理没有结合的原因是，主通过一个人的生命，因而通过在真理里面的灵魂进入他的信之真理。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9380</b></p><p><b>9380.</b>
And the people shall not come up with him. That this signifies no conjunction whatever with the external apart from the internal, is evident from the signification of "coming up," as being conjunction 
(as above, n. 9373); here no conjunction, because it is said they "shall not come up." That it denotes no conjunction with the external sense of the Word apart from the internal, is because the sons 
of Jacob, who are here meant by "the people," were in what is external without what is internal (see n. 3479, 4281, 4293, 4307, 4429, 4433, 4680, 4844, 4847, 4865, 4868, 4874, 4899, 4903, 4911, 4913, 
6304, 8588, 8788, 8806, 8871). That they were in what is external without what is internal, is very manifest from the worship of the golden calf forty days after this time. They would have acted differently 
if they had been at the same time in what is internal, that is, in the good of love to and of faith in Jehovah; for this is what is internal. Those who have been conjoined by this cannot go away 
to the worship of an idol, because their heart is far from it and because that people was conjoined with the Lord merely by external things, by which they represented internal things, therefore it 
is said "the people shall not come up," by which is signified that there is no conjunction whatever with an external that is devoid of an internal. The representations that are devoid of the knowledge, 
faith, and affection of the interior things that are represented, conjoin the thing, but not the person.  [2] The case is the same with those who remain in the mere literal sense of the Word, and gather 
from it nothing of doctrine; for they are separated from the internal sense, because the internal sense is doctrine itself. The conjunction of the Lord with the external things of the Word is through 
its interior things; and therefore if the interior things have been separated, there is possible no other conjunction of the Lord with the external things than as with a gesture of the body without 
any agreement of the heart. It is the very same with those who are perfectly acquainted with all the particulars of the doctrine of their church, and yet do not apply them to life. These also are 
in external things devoid of what is internal, for with them the truths of doctrine are outside so long as they have not been inscribed on their life. The reason why there is no conjunction of the Lord 
with their truths, is that the Lord enters into a man's truths of faith through his life; thus through the soul which is in the truths. </p>

'And the people shall not come up with him' means no joining whatever to the outward without the inward. This is clear from the meaning of 'coming up' as being joined to, as above in <a href="9373.htm">9373</a>, at this point 
no joining since it says 'shall not come up'. The reason why no joining to the outward sense of the Word without the inward is meant is that the children of Jacob, to whom 'the people' refers here, 
were restricted to external things devoid of anything internal, see <a href="3479.htm">3479</a>, <a href="4281.htm">4281</a>, <a href="4293.htm">4293</a>, <a href="4307.htm">4307</a>, <a href="4429.htm">4429</a>, <a href="4433.htm">4433</a>, <a href="4680.htm">4680</a>, <a href="4844.htm">4844</a>, <a href="4847.htm">4847</a>, <a href="4865.htm">4865</a>, <a href="4868.htm">4868</a>, <a href="4874.htm">4874</a>, <a href="4899.htm">4899</a>, <a href="4903.htm">4903</a>, <a href="4911.htm">4911</a>, <a href="4913.htm">4913</a>, <a href="6304.htm">6304</a>, <a href="8588.htm">8588</a>, <a href="8788.htm">8788</a>, <a href="8806.htm">8806</a>, <a href="8871.htm">8871</a>. Their 
devotion to external things devoid of anything internal is plainly evident from their worship of the golden calf forty days on from that time. They would have behaved differently if they had been conscious 
at the same time of internal things, that is, of the good of love to and faith in Jehovah, that good being what is inward. Those who have been joined to Him by this good cannot depart into the 
worship of an idol, because their heart is far away from this. But since that people were not joined to the Lord except through outward forms, by which inward realities were represented, it says that 
'the people shall not come up', meaning that there shall be no joining whatever to the outward without the inward. Representations without any knowledge of, belief in, or affection for the inner realities 
that are represented cause the thing to be joined but not the person.  </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The situation is similar with those who keep solely to the literal sense of the Word and acquire no teaching at all 
from the Word, because they are separated from the internal sense, the internal sense being such teaching itself. The Lord joins Himself to outward images of the Word through its inner contents. Therefore 
if the inner contents have been separated no joining of the Lord to the outward images can exist other than one resembling a bodily gesture that is not in accord with the heart. The situation is 
similar also with those who have a perfect, detailed knowledge of the teachings of their Church, yet do not apply them to life. They too are restricted to external things devoid of anything inward, for 
the truths contained in such teachings occupy an external position with those people if they have not been inscribed on their life. There is no joining of the Lord to these people's truths, because 
the Lord enters a person's truths of faith by way of his life, thus by way of the soul within the truths.  </p>

`Et populus non ascendet cum illo': quod significet plane non conjunctionem cum externo absque interno, constat ex significatione `ascendere' quod sit conjunctio, ut supra n. 9373, hic non conjunctio, 
quia dicitur `non ascendet'; quod sit cum Verbi sensu externo absque interno, est quia filii Jacobi, qui hic sunt `populus,' in externo absque interno erant, videatur n. 3479, 4281, 4293, 4307, 4429, 
4433, 4680, 4844, 4847, 4865, 4868, 4874, (x)4899, 4903, 4911, 4913, 6304, 8588, 8788, 8806, 8871.  Quod in externo absque interno essent, patet manifeste ex cultu vituli aurei post quadraginta abhinc 
dies; aliter fecissent si simul in interno fuissent, hoc est, in bono amoris et fidei in Jehovam, hoc enim est internum; qui per hoc conjuncti sunt, illi non discedere possunt ad cultum idoli, cor 
enim procul ab illo est; et quia populus ille non aliter conjunctus fuit Domino quam per externa, per quae repraesentarent interna, ideo dicitur quod `populus' non ascendet{1},' per quae significatur 
plane non conjunctio cum externo absque interno; {2}repraesentationes quae absque cognitione, fide, et affectione interiorum quae repraesentantur, conjungunt rem, non autem personam. 2 Similiter se 
habet cum illis qui in {3}solo sensu litterali Verbi manent et nihil doctrinale inde colligunt; sunt enim separati a sensu interno, (d)nam sensus internus est ipsum doctrinale; conjunctio Domini cum externis 
Verbi est per interiora ejus; quare si interiora separata sunt, non alia cum externis conjunctio Domini datur quam sicut cum gestu corporis absque corde concordante.  Similiter quoque se habet 
cum illis qui doctrinam suae Ecclesiae quoad singula perfecte sciunt, et usque illa non applicant ad vitam; illi etiam in externis sunt absque interno, nam vera doctrinae sunt extra apud illos cum non 
inscripta sunt eorum vitae; quod cum horum veris non sit conjunctio Domini, est quia Dominus intrat per vitam hominis in ejus fidei vera, ita per animam quae inest veris{4}. </p>
