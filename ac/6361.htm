<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6361节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6361.</strong>“使他们散居在以色列”表他们也必从属灵人那里被逐出。这从“散居”的含义清楚可知，“散居”也是指逐出；但是，“散居”（scattering）与“分散”（dividing）是有区别的，“分散”论及外在人和真理，而“散居”论及内在人和良善。“雅各”代表属世人或外在人，“以色列”代表属灵人或内在人（参看<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>，<a href="4292.htm">4292</a>，<a href="4570.htm">4570</a>节）。以色列指着西缅和利未所说的这些话，以及指着流便所说的话并非表示末后之日临到他们后代的那类事，如第1节经文所说的那样。这一点可从以下事实看出来：西缅和利未的后代并未受到诅咒，也没有分散在雅各中，散居在以色列；因为西缅支派就在其余支派之中，是它们当中的一支；利未支派则作了祭司，因而受到祝福，而非诅咒；流便支派也是如此，它也没有比其它支派更卑劣。由此很明显地看出，本章指着雅各的儿子们所说关于他们必遇之事的话，不是指将要临到这些后代本身的事，乃是临到他们在内义上所表示的那些人的事；在此是指临到那些陷入与仁分离之信的人的事，因为此处“流便”、“西缅”和“利未”在内义上表示这些人。由此很清楚地看出，圣言的内义不会显现在字面上，也不会显现给任何人，除非他知道属世事物与属灵事物的对应关系。事实上，凡不知道何为属灵事物或属天事物的人根本看不到这一点。</p>

And scatter them in Israel. That this signifies from the spiritual man also, is evident from the signification of "scattering," as being banishment; but "scattering" is distinguished from "dividing" 
in that the latter is predicated of the external man and of truth, but "scattering" of the internal man and of good. (That Jacob represents the natural or external man, and Israel the spiritual or internal, 
may be seen above, n. 4286, 4292, 4570.) That these things which were said by Israel of Simeon and Levi, and also those which were said of Reuben, do not signify what would befall their descendants 
in the end of the days, as is said in the first verse, may be seen from the fact that the descendants of Simeon and Levi were not cursed, and divided in Jacob and scattered in Israel; for the tribe 
of Simeon was among the rest of the tribes as one of them; and the tribe of Levi was made the priesthood, thus was rather blessed than cursed; and so with the tribe of Reuben, which also was not more 
vile than the other tribes. Hence it is very manifest that what is said in this chapter of the sons of Jacob, as to what should befall them in the end of the days, is not what should befall themselves, 
but what should befall those who are meant by them in the internal sense; and here those who are in faith separated from charity, for these are here meant in the internal sense by "Reuben," "Simeon," 
and "Levi." From this it is very evident that there is an internal sense of the Word which does not appear in the letter, nor to anyone unless he knows the correspondences of natural things with 
spiritual, and not at all to him who does not know what the spiritual and what the celestial are. </p>

'And will scatter them in Israel' means that they are to be banished from the spiritual man. This is clear from the meaning of 'scattering' too as a banishment; but 'scattering' is distinguished from 
'dividing' by the fact that the latter is used in reference to the external man and to truth, whereas the former is used in reference to the internal man and to good - 'Jacob' represents the natural 
or external man, and 'Israel' the spiritual or internal man, see <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>, <a href="4291.htm">4291</a>, <a href="4570.htm">4570</a>.  </p>
<p>These things that Israel stated regarding Simeon and Levi, and also those regarding Reuben, do not mean such things 
as would happen, as verse 1 says, to their descendants at the end of days. This can be recognized from the fact that those descended from Simeon and from Levi were not cursed; nor were they divided 
in Jacob and scattered in Israel. The tribe of Simeon existed among the rest of the tribes as one of their number, while the tribe of Levi became the priesthood and so was blessed rather than cursed. 
Nor likewise was the tribe of Reuben inferior to any other tribe. From this it is quite evident that the things stated in this chapter about what would happen to the sons of Jacob at the end of days 
refer to what would happen not to those actual descendants but to people who are meant by them in the internal sense. At this point what would happen to those with faith separated from charity is meant, 
for they are the ones who are meant at this point in the internal sense by Reuben, Simeon, and Levi. From this it becomes perfectly clear that the internal sense of the Word is not that which shows 
itself in the letter; nor can that sense be seen by anyone unless he has a knowledge of the correspondences of natural things with spiritual ones. Indeed it is not seen at all by anyone who does not 
know what the spiritual is or what the celestial is. </p>

`Et dispergam eos in Israele':  quod significet quod a spirituali, constat a significatione `dispergere' quod etiam sit exterminatio; sed `dispergere' distinguitur a `dividere', quod hoc praedicetur 
de externo homine {1}ac de vero, illud autem de interno {2}ac de bono; quod `Jacob' repraesentet naturalem seu externum hominem, et `Israel' spiritualem seu internum, videatur n. 4286, 4292, 4570.  Quod 
haec quae ab Israele de Shimeone et Levi dicta sunt, tum quae de Reubene, non significent talia quae posteris illorum `contingerent in postremitate dierum' ut dicitur vers. 1, constare potest ex eo 
quod non posteri ex Shimeone et ex Levi maledicti fuerint ac divisi in Jacobo et dispersi in Israele, nam tribus Shimeonis inter reliquas tribus fuit sicut una illarum, et tribus Levi facta est sacerdotium, 
ita potius benedicta quam maledicta; pariter tribus Reubenis quae quoque aliis tribubus non vilior fuit; inde manifeste patet quod {3} quae in hoc capite de filiis Jacobi, quid illis in postremitate 
dierum contingeret, dicta sunt, non sint quae illis ipsis contingerent sed quae illis qui in sensu interno per eos intelliguntur; hic quid illis qui in fide separata a charitate sunt; nam hi per 
Reubenem, Shimeonem et Levi hic in sensu interno intelliguntur; inde manifeste constare potest quod sensus internus Verbi sit qui non apparet in littera, nec alicui nisi sciat correspondentias naturalium 
cum spiritualibus, et qui prorsus non apparet ei qui non scit quid spirituale et quid caeleste. @1 qui est Jacob$ @2 qui est Israel, et ex repraesentatione Israelis, quod sit spiritualis seu 
internus homo$  @3 i haec$ </p>
