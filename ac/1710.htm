<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1710.</strong>“追敌直到但”表净化的状态。这从内义上整个思路清楚可知。“追敌”在此是指逐出同善与真在一起、使它们仅表面上看似善与真的恶与假，从而释放并净化它们。“直到但”表迦南的最远边界，因而表它们所逃到的最外围。“但”表最远的边界，或迦南的最外围，这明显可见于圣言的很多地方。如撒母耳记：<br />废去扫罗家的国度，建立大卫的王位，使他治理以色列和犹大，从但直到别是巴。（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下3.10.htm">3:10</a>）<br /><br />以色列众人，从但直到别是巴，都聚集起来。（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下17.11.htm">17:11</a>）<br /><br />大卫对约押说，你去走遍以色列众支派，从但直到别是巴。（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下24.2.htm">24:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下24.15.htm">15</a>）<br />列王纪：<br />从但到别是巴的犹大人和以色列人，都在自己的葡萄树下和无花果树下安然居住。（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上4.25.htm">4:25</a>）<br />由上述经文明显可知，“但”是迦南最远的边界，侵扰外在人的良善与真理的敌人就被追到那个方向。不过，由于“但”是迦南的边界，却仍在迦南境内，故为了不让它们留在迦南境内，它们被驱逐得更远，到了“大马士革左边的何把”，这从下一节清楚可知，净化就是以这种方式实现的。就象前面说的，就神圣意义而言，“迦南地”表主的国度，因而表爱的属天元素，或爱之良善，主要是主里面的良善。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1710.</strong> The symbolism of and he pursued all the way to Dan as the state of his purification can be seen from the series of ideas in the inner meaning. Here, pursuing enemies is driving off the evil and falsity that coexisted with [apparent] goodness and truth and made them look good and true. So it means freeing and purifying them. All the way to Dan means to the farthest border of Canaan, so it means to the outermost limits of their flight. Throughout the Word Dan can be seen to symbolize the farthest borders or outermost limits of Canaan. In Samuel, for instance:<br />... to transfer the kingship from the house of Saul, and to raise the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan all the way to Beer-sheba. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1710/bible_king-james-version_2-samuel_3_10" target=_top>2 Samuel 3:10</a>)<br />In the same author:<br />The whole of Israel without exception shall be gathered from Dan all the way to Beer-sheba. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1710/bible_king-james-version_2-samuel_17_11" target=_top>2 Samuel 17:11</a>)<br />In the same author:<br />David said to Joab, "Roam through all the tribes of Israel from Dan all the way to Beer-sheba." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1710/bible_king-james-version_2-samuel_24_2" target=_top>2 Samuel 24:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1710/bible_king-james-version_2-samuel_24_15" target=_top>15</a>)<br />In Kings:<br />Judah and Israel lived in safety, all of them under their own grapevine and under their own fig tree, from Dan all the way to Beer-sheba. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1710/bible_king-james-version_1-kings_4_25" target=_top>1 Kings 4:25</a>)<br />From these passages it is clear that Dan was the farthest border of Canaan,{*1} and that Abram pursued his enemies that far — the enemies that overran the goodness and truth of the Lord's outer self. Because Dan was the border of Canaan, however, and was therefore inside Canaan, he chased them even farther in order to rid the land of them completely — to Hobah on the left of Damascus, as the next verse says. This is how he accomplished the purification. In a holy sense the land of Canaan symbolizes the Lord's kingdom, as mentioned earlier [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1710/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1" target=_top>1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1710/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_620" target=_top>620</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1710/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1413" target=_top>1413</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1710/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1437" target=_top>1437</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1710/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585" target=_top>1585:1-2</a>]. Consequently it symbolizes the heavenly effect of love, or that which is good — chiefly goodness in the Lord.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Specifically, "the farthest border of Canaan" is the northernmost border.

And pursued even to Dan. That this signifies a state of purification, is evident from the connection of the things in the internal sense. To "pursue the enemies" is here to expel the evils and falsities 
which were with the goods and truths, and that caused them to merely appear to be goods and truths, and thus to liberate and purify them. "Even to Dan," signifies to the farthest limit of Canaan, 
thus to the uttermost boundaries whither they had fled. That "Dan" signifies the farthest limits, or the extreme boundaries of Canaan, is evident in many places in the Word. As in Samuel: </p>
<p>     To transfer 
the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba (2 Sam. 3:10). Again: </p>
<p>     In gathering, all Israel shall be gathered 
together, from Dan even to Beersheba (2 Sam. 17:11). Again: </p>
<p>     David said to Joab, Go now to and fro through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba (2 Sam. 24:2, 15). In the book 
of Kings: </p>
<p>     Judah and Israel dwelt in safety, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba (1 Kings 4:25). From these passages it is evident that Dan was the farthest 
boundary of Canaan, whither the enemies were pursued which infested the goods and truths of the external man. But as Dan was a boundary of Canaan, and therefore within Canaan, lest they should stay 
there, they were driven further, namely, "to Hobah on the left of Damascus," as is evident from the things stated in the verse next following, and in this way purification was effected. By the land 
of Canaan, in a holy sense, as before said, is signified the Lord's kingdom, thus the celestial of love, or good; primarily, the good with the Lord. </p>

'And pursued as far as Dan' means a state of purification. This is clear from the train of thought in the internal sense. 'Pursuing enemies' here means casting out the evils and falsities which were 
present with goods and truths and which caused these to be no more than goods and truths in outward appearance, and thus it means liberating them and purifying them. 'As far as Dan' means to Canaan's 
furthest boundary, and so to the outer limits to which they had fled. That Dan means the furthest boundaries or outer limits of Canaan is clear from various parts of the Word, as in Samuel, </p>

Kings, </p>
<p>Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every one under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba. <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 4:25. </p>
<p>From these quotations it is evident that Dan was the furthest boundary 
of Canaan, in which direction the enemies were pursued that were infesting the goods and truths of the External Man. But because Dan was a boundary of Canaan, and so inside Canaan, they were driven 
still further away so that they should not remain there - namely to 'Hobah on the left of Damascus', as is clear from the verse that comes next - and in this way purification was accomplished. As 
stated already, 'the land of Canaan' means in a holy sense the Lord's kingdom, and thus the celestial element of love, or the good of love, chiefly the good residing in the Lord. </p>

'Et persecutus usque {1}ad Dan: quod significet purificationis statum, constat a serie rerum in sensu interno; 'persequi hostes' hic est expellere mala et falsa quae erant apud bona et vera et faciebant 
ut apparerent sicut bona et vera, et sic liberare illa et purificare; 'usque ad Dan' significat ad ultimum terminum Canaanis, sic ad extremos fines quo fugerant; quod 'Dan' significet ultimos terminos 
seu extremos fines Canaanis, constat passim a Verbo, ut apud Samuelem, Ad transferendum regnum a domo Shaulis, et ad erigendum solium Davidis super Israelem et super Jehudam, a Dan et usque Beershebam, 
2 Sam. iii 10: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Congregando congregabitur universus Israel a Dan usque Beershebam, 2 Sam. xvii 11: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Dixit David ad Joabum,...Pervagare omnes tribus Israelis a Dan 
usque Beershebam, 2 Sam. xxiv 2, 15: </p>
<p>in Libro Regum, Habitavit Jehudah et Israel in securitate, quisque sub vite sua, et sub ficu sua a Dan et usque Beershebam, 1 Reg. v 5; </p>
<p>ex quibus patet quod Dan 
fuerit ultimus terminus Canaanis, quousque persecutus hostes qui infestabant bona et vera Externi Hominis; sed quia Dan erat terminus Canaanis sic intra Canaanem, et ne ibi essent, ulterius profugavit, 
nempe 'ad Hobam a sinistra Damasco' ut constat ab illis in versu mox sequente, ac ita purificavit; per 'terram Canaanem' in sensu sancto, ut dictum prius, significatur regnum Domini, ita caeleste amoris 
seu bonum, principaliter bonum apud Dominum. @1 Though usque Dan is quite correct and has been used hitherto, I here inserts ad.  Heb. is simply 'ad.'$  </p>
