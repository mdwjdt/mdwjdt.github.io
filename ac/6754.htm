Verses 11-14. And it came to pass in those days, and Moses grew, and he went out unto his brethren, and saw their burdens; and he saw an Egyptian man smiting a Hebrew man, one of his brethren. And he 
looked forth hither and thither, and saw that there was no man, and he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. And he went out the second day, and behold two Hebrew men quarreling; and he said to 
the wicked one, Wherefore smitest thou thy companion? And he said, Who set thee for a man, a prince, and a judge over us? Sayest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and 
said, Surely the word is known. "And it came to pass in those days, and Moses grew," signifies when those states lasted, and there was increase in true memory-knowledges; "and he went out unto his brethren," 
signifies conjunction with the truths of the church; "and saw their burdens," signifies a noticing that they were infested by falsities; "and he saw an Egyptian man smiting a Hebrew man," signifies 
alienated memory-knowledge endeavoring to destroy the truth of the church; "one of his brethren," signifies with which he was conjoined; "and he looked forth hither and thither, and saw that there 
was no man," signifies foresight as to whether he was in safety; "and he smote the Egyptian," signifies that he destroyed the alienated memory-knowledge; "and hid him in the sand," signifies that 
he removed it to where falsities are; "and he went out the second day," signifies conjunction again with the church; "and behold two Hebrew men quarreling," signifies a noticing that within the church 
they were fighting among themselves; "and he said to the wicked one, Wherefore smitest thou thy companion?" signifies rebuke because one desired to destroy the faith of another; "and he said, Who set 
thee for a man a prince and a judge over us?" signifies perception that he was not yet so far advanced in the truths of the church as to settle differences within the church; "sayest thou to kill me," 
signifies wouldest thou destroy my faith; "as thou killedst the Egyptian," signifies as thou hast destroyed falsity; "and Moses feared, and said, Surely the word is known," signifies that he was among 
alienated memory-knowledges, and not yet in truths so as to be safe. </p>

Verses 11-14 And it happened in those days, when Moses had grown up, that he went out to his brothers, and saw their burdens. And he saw an Egyptian man striking a Hebrew man, one of his brothers. And 
he looked this way and that, and saw that there was no man; and he struck the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. And he went out the second day, and behold, two Hebrew men were quarrelling; and he said 
to the one in the wrong, Why are you striking your companion? And he said, Who set you up as a man-prince and a judge over us? Do you intend<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian? And Moses was 
afraid, and said, Surely the matter is known! </p>
<p>'And it happened in those days, when Moses had grown up means while those states lasted, and an increase in factual knowledge holding truths within it. 
'That he went out to his brothers' means a joining to the Church's truths. 'And saw their burdens' means a discernment that they were being molested by falsities. 'And he saw an Egyptian man striking 
a Hebrew man' means alienated factual knowledge trying to destroy the Church's truth. 'One of his brothers' means the truths to which he was to be joined. 'And he looked this way and that, and saw that 
there was no man' means care taken to see whether it was safe. 'And he struck the Egyptian' means that he destroyed alienated factual knowledge. 'And hid him in the sand' means that he banished it 
to where falsities were. 'And he went out the second day' means a joining once again to the Church. 'And behold, two Hebrew men were quarrelling' means a discernment that within the Church people were 
in conflict with one another. 'And he said to the one in the wrong, Why are you striking your companion?' means a rebuke, deploring that one person should wish to destroy another's faith. 'And he said, 
Who set you up as a man-prince and a judge over us?' means a perception that he was not yet so advanced into the truths of the Church that he could settle disagreements within the Church. 'Do you intend 
to kill me . . . means, Do you wish to destroy my faith...'As you killed the Egyptian?' means, As you destroyed falsity? 'And Moses was afraid, and said, Surely the matter is known!' means that 
he was among alienated factual knowledge and not yet so strong in truths as to be safe from harm.

Vers. 11-14.  Et factum {1} in diebus illis, et crevit Moscheh, et exivit ad fratres suos, et vidit onera illorum, et vidit virum Aegyptium percutientem virum Hebraeum e fratribus suis. Et prospexit 
huc et illuc, et vidit quod nullus vir, et percussit Aegyptium, et {2}abscondidit illum in arena.  Et exivit die altero, et ecce duo viri Hebraei altercantes, et dixit improbo, Quare percutis socium 
tuum?  Et dixit, Quis posuit te ad virum principem et judicem super nos? num ad occidendum me tu dicis, quemadmodum occidisti Aegyptium? et timuit Moscheh, et dixit, Certe notum est verbum.  `Et factum 
in diebus illis, et crevit Moscheh' significat cum status illi perstarent, et incrementum in veris scientificis: `et exivit ad fratres suos' significat conjunctionem cum veris Ecclesiae: `et vidit onera 
illorum' significat apperceptionem quod infestarentur a falsis: `et vidit virum Aegyptium percutientem virum Hebraeum' significat scientificum abalienatum conans destruere verum Ecclesiae: `e fratribus 
suis' significat quibus conjunctus esset: `et prospexit huc et illuc, et vidit quod nullus vir' significat prudentiam num in tuto esset: et percussit Aegyptium' significat quod destrueret scientificum 
abalienatum: `et abscondidit illum in arena' significat quod ablegaverit ubi falsa: `et exivit die altero' significat conjunctionem iterum cum Ecclesia: `et ecce duo viri Hebraei altercantes' 
significat apperceptionem quod intra Ecclesiam inter se pugnarent: `et dixit improbo, Quare percutis socium tuum?' significat increpationem quod unus alterius fidem destruere vellet: `et dixit, Quis posuit 
te ad virum principem et judicem super nos?' significat perceptionem quod nondum in vera Ecclesiae tantum provectus ut dirimeret dissidia intra Ecclesiam: `Num ad occidendum me tu dicis?' significat 
num meam fidem destruere velis: `quemadmodum occidisti Aegyptium' significat sicut destruxisti falsum: `et timuit (x)Moscheh, et dixit, Certe notum est verbum' significat quod inter scientifica abalienata 
esset, et nondum in veris, ut tutus. 	@1 i est I$ 	@2 abscondit I$ </p>
