<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8393节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8393.</strong>口头上而非生活中的悔改不是悔改。口头上的悔改不会使罪得到宽恕；只有生活中的悔改才能做到这一点。主作为怜悯本身，总是宽恕人的罪；但罪却粘附于人，无论他多么以为它们已经得到宽恕。这些罪若不通过照信之诫命生活，也不会从他身上移除。他在生活中遵行这些诫命到何等程度，他的罪就在何等程度上被移除；他的罪在何等程度上被移除，就在何等程度上被宽恕。因为主使人退离邪恶，将他保守在良善中；他在来世能远离邪恶到他活在肉身期间抵制邪恶的程度；那时，他能被保持在良善中到他活在肉身期间出于对良善的情感而行善的程度。由此可见何为罪的宽恕，它是如何发生的。凡认为还有其它任何方式可以使罪得到宽恕的人都大错特错了。</p>

Repentance of the mouth and not of the life is not repentance. Sins are not forgiven through repentance of the mouth, but through repentance of the life. Sins are continually being forgiven man by the 
Lord, for He is mercy itself; but sins adhere to the man, however much he may suppose that they have been forgiven, nor are they removed from him except through a life according to the commands of faith. 
So far as he lives according to these commands, so far his sins are removed; and so far as they are removed, so far they have been forgiven. For by the Lord man is withheld from evil, and is held 
in good; and he is so far able to be withheld from evil in the other life, as in the life of the body he has resisted evil; and he is so far able to be held in good then, as in the life of the body 
he has done what is good from affection. This shows what the forgiveness of sins is, and whence it is. He who believes that sins are forgiven in any other way, is much mistaken. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8393</b></p><p><b>8393.</b>
Repentance present on the lips but not in one's life is not repentance. Lip repentance does not cause sins to be forgiven; only repentance in life can lead to this. Being Mercy itself, the Lord is constantly 
forgiving a person's sins; but sins cling to a person no matter how much he supposes them to have been forgiven. Nor are they removed from him except through a life in keeping with the commandments 
of faith. To the extent that his life is in keeping with them his sins are removed; and to the extent that his sins are removed they have been forgiven. For a person is withheld from evil by the 
Lord and maintained in good; for he can be withheld from evil in the next life to the extent that during his lifetime he was resisting evil, and he can be maintained in good then to the extent that 
during his lifetime he was doing good out of an affection for it. From all this one may see what the forgiveness of sins is and how it arises. Anyone who supposes that there is any other way in which 
sins are forgiven is much mistaken. </p>

</p><b>8393.</b>
Paenitentia oris et non vitae non est paenitentia; per paenitentiam oris non remittuntur peccata, sed per paenitentiam vitae.  Remittuntur homini continue peccata a Domino, nam est ipsa Misericordia; 
sed peccata adhaerent homini utcumque putat quod remissa sint, nec ab ipso removentur nisi quam per vitam secundum praecepta fidei; quantum secundum illa vivit, tantum peccata removentur, et quantum 
removentur tantum remissa sunt; homo enim a Domino detinetur a malo et tenetur in bono; et tantum detineri potest a malo in altera vita, quantum in vita corporis restiterat malo, et tantum teneri potest 
in bono tunc, quantum in vita corporis ex affectione egerat bonum; inde constare potest quid peccatorum remissio et unde; qui credit quod peccata aliter remittantur multum fallitur. </p>
