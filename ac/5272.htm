<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5272节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5272.</strong>“这就是我对法老所讲的话”表在属灵层的属天层引导下的属世层的思维。这从“话”和“讲”的含义，以及“约瑟”和“法老”的代表清楚可知：“话”是指真实事物，如下文所述；“讲”（speaking）是指思考（参看<a href="2271.htm">2271</a>，<a href="2287.htm">2287</a>，<a href="2619.htm">2619</a>，<a href="5259.htm">5259</a>节）；在此讲述的“约瑟”是指属灵层的属天层；“法老”是指属世层，如前所述。由此明显可知，“这就是我对法老所讲的话”表示真实事物，或在属灵层的属天层引导下的属世层的思维（也可参看<a href="5262.htm">5262</a>节）。至于“话”是什么意思，在原文，“话”表示某种真实事物；这解释了为何神性启示被称为“圣言”，又为何在至高意义上主自己也被称为圣言。“圣言”用来论及主，以及从主所得的启示时，在最近似意义上表示神性真理，一切真实事物皆从神性真理拥有自己的存在。<br />一切真实事物皆通过从主发出的神性真理，因而通过圣言已经存在并正在存在，这个观念是一个尚未被揭示的奥秘。人们对此的信仰和理解是，一切事物都已经被造，因为神就像世上的国王那样已经说出并发布了祂的命令。然而，这并不是“一切事物都是藉着圣言作成并被造”这句话的意思。确切地说，意思是，从神性良善，也就是从主发出的神性真理是已经存在并正在存在的一切事物的发出者；或也可说，一切事物皆从这神性真理存在并正在存在。从神性良善发出的神性真理是宇宙或一切创造中的绝对终极实体和本质存在；这神性真理就是那作成并创造万物的。不过，人们对神性真理几乎没有任何其它概念，只是认为它不过是从讲话者的嘴里发出并散布到空气中的一个词或一句话。对神性真理的概念又导致了以下观点：“圣言”仅仅表示一个命令，因此已被造的一切事物的存在仅仅因为一个已经发布的命令，而不是因为从主的神性发出的某种真实事物。但如前所述，从主发出的神性真理才是绝对的终极实体和本质存在，也就是万物的源头；良善与真理的形式皆由此而存在。不过，对于这个奥秘，蒙主的神性怜悯，我们会在后面予以详述。</p>

This is the word that I spoke unto Pharaoh. That this signifies what the natural thought from the celestial of the spiritual, is evident from the signification of a "word," as being a real thing (of 
which hereafter); from the signification of "speaking," as being to think (see n. 2271, 2287, 2619, 5259); from the representation of Joseph, who here speaks, as being the celestial of the spiritual; 
and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being the natural (of which above). From all this it is plain that by "this is the word that I spoke unto Pharaoh" is signified that real thing, or that which 
the natural thought from the celestial of the spiritual (see also n. 5262). As regards what is meant by the "word," in the original language by "word" is meant some real thing; and hence Divine revelation 
is called the "Word," and so also is the Lord in the supreme sense. And by the "Word," when predicated of the Lord, and also of revelation from Him, in the proximate sense is signified Divine truth, 
from which all things that are real have their existence.  [2] That all things that are real have come into existence and do come into existence through the Divine truth that is from the Lord, 
and thus through the Word, is a secret that has not yet been disclosed. It is believed that by this is meant that all things have been created by God's saying and commanding as a king in his kingdom. 
It is not this, however, that is meant by all things having been made and created through the Word, but it is the Divine truth that proceeds from the Divine good, that is, from the Lord, from which all 
things have come into existence and do come into existence. The Divine truth proceeding from the Divine good is the veriest reality and the veriest essential in the universe, and it is this that makes 
and creates. Scarcely anyone has any other idea of the Divine truth than as of a word that issues from the mouth of a speaker and is dispersed in the air. This idea of the Divine truth has produced 
the opinion that by the "Word" is meant only a command, thus that all things were made merely by a command, and thus not from any real thing that has proceeded from the Divine of the Lord; but as already 
said it is the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, the veriest reality and essential, that is the source of all things, and from which are the forms of good and of truth. Regarding this secret 
however, of the Lord's Divine mercy more will be said in the following pages. </p>

'This is the word which I have spoken to Pharaoh' means what the natural was led to think by the celestial of the spiritual. This is clear from the meaning of 'the word' as the real thing, dealt with 
below; from the meaning of 'speaking' as thinking, dealt with in <a href="2271.htm">2271</a>, <a href="2287.htm">2287</a>, <a href="2619.htm">2619</a>, <a href="5259.htm">5259</a>; from the representation of 'Joseph', who is the speaker here, as the celestial of the spiritual, and from the 
representation of 'Pharaoh' as the natural, both of whom are dealt with above. From all this it is evident that 'this is the word which I have spoken to Pharaoh' means the real thing, or what the natural 
was led to think by the celestial of the spiritual; see also <a href="5262.htm">5262</a>. Regarding the term 'the word', this is used in the original language to express the idea of the real thing. This also explains why 
Divine revelation is called the Word, and why too in the highest sense the Lord Himself is called such. And when 'the Word' is used to refer to the Lord, as also when it is used to refer to revelation 
received from Him, Divine Truth - the source of every real thing that comes into being - is meant in the proximate sense. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 This idea that all real things have been brought and are being brought 
into being by means of Divine Truth going forth from the Lord, thus by means of the Word, is an arcanum which has yet to be disclosed. People's belief and understanding of this is that all things have 
been created because God has spoken and issued His command, as a king does in his kingdom. But that is not what is meant by saying that all things have been made and created by the Word. Rather, the 
meaning is that Divine Truth which goes forth from Divine Good, that is, which goes forth from the Lord, is the originator of all things that have been brought and are being brought into being. Divine 
Truth going forth from Divine Good is the ultimate reality and the essential being within all creation; and this Divine Truth is what makes and creates all things. But scarcely anyone has any other 
idea of Divine Truth than this - a word or utterance issuing from a speaker's mouth and transmitted into the air. This idea about Divine Truth leads to the notion that 'the Word' means simply a command, 
so that all things that have been made exist solely because a command has been delivered, not because of some reality that has come forth from the Lord's Divine. But as has been stated, the Divine 
Truth going forth from the Lord is the ultimate reality and essential being from which all things derive their existence. Every form of what is good and true owes its existence to this. But in the Lord's 
Divine mercy more will be said later on regarding this arcanum. </p>

`Hoc verbum quod locutus sum ad Pharaonem': quod significet quod {1}cogitavit naturale e caelesti spiritualis, constat (e)ex significatione `verbi' quod sit res, de qua sequitur; (m)ex significatione 
`loqui' quod sit cogitare, de qua n. (x)2271, 2287, 2619, 5259; ex repraesentatione `Josephi' qui hic loquitur, quod sit caeleste spiritualis; et ex repraesentatione `Pharaonis' quod sit naturale, de 
quibus supra; ex {2}his patet quod per `hoc verbum quod locutus sum ad Pharaonem' significetur illa res, vel illud quod cogitavit naturale e caelesti spiritualis; videatur etiam n. 5262. Quod verbum 
attinet,(n) in lingua originali res per `verbum' exprimitur, inde quoque revelatio Divina vocatur Verbum, et quoque Dominus in (t)supremo sensu; et per Verbum cum praedicatur de Domino, et quoque de 
revelatione ab Ipso, in proximo sensu significatur Divinum Verum ex quo omnia quae res sunt, existunt; [2] quod omnia quae res sunt, per Divinum Verum quod a Domino, ita per Verbum, exstiterint et existant, 
est arcanum quod nondum est detectum; creditur quod per id intelligatur quod omnia creata fuerint per quod Deus dixerit et mandaverit, sicut rex in suo regno, sed hoc non intelligitur per quod 
omnia per Verbum facta et creata sint, sed est Divinum Verum quod procedit (e)ex Divino Bono, hoc est, quod procedit a Domino, a Quo omnia {3}exstiterunt et existunt; Divinum Verum procedens a Divino 
Bono est ipsissimum reale et ipsissimum essentiale quod in universo; hoc facit et creat; de Divino Vero vix aliquis aliam ideam habet quam sicut de verbo quod fluit ex ore loquentis et dissipatur in aere; 
haec idea de Divino Vero produxit eam opinionem quod per Verbum intelligatur modo mandatum, et sic quod solum ex mandato omnia facta sint, ita non ex aliquo reali quod processit ex Divino Domini; 
sed ut dictum, est Divinum Verum procedens a Domino ipsissimum reale et essentiale, ex quo omnia; formae boni et veri sunt ex illo; at de hoc arcano plura, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus.
