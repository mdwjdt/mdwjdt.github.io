<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>482.</strong>本章出现的“年”（或“岁”）和“年数”（或岁数）所表示的内义，至今尚无人知晓。沉浸于字义之人以为它们就是世俗所说的年岁，然而从这里到第十二章，没有丝毫如表面字义所表示的历史概念，所有事物均另有所指，无论总体还是细节。不仅名字如此，数字也是这样。圣言经常提及数字“3”，还有数字“7”，但凡出现这些数字，均表示圣物或神圣不可侵犯，它们与这时期或所提及的其它事物象征或代表的那些状态相关。而且无论最小的时间段还是最大的时间段，它们的含义都一样，因为正如部分属于整体，最小的事物属于最大的事物；为了整体可以从部分中完满而出，或最大的从最小的完满而出，必存在一种相似性。因此，以赛亚书中说：<br />但现在耶和华宣告，说：“三年之内，按照雇工的年数，摩押的荣耀必被藐视”。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛16.14.htm">16:14</a>）<br />主对我这样说：“一年之内，照雇工的年数，基达的一切荣耀必归于无有”。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛21.16.htm">21:16</a>）<br />上述经文中，无论时间长短，意义都一样。在哈巴谷书：<br />耶和华啊！我听见你的名声；我惧怕。耶和华啊！求你在这些年间复兴你的作为，在这些年间显明出来。（哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈3.2.htm">3:2</a>）<br />此处的“年间”表主的降临。若时间短，就表示主的每一次降临，如人正被重生之时；若时间长，则表示主的教会正重新兴起之时。在以赛亚书中还被称为“救赎的年日”：<br />报仇的日子在我心中，我救赎的年岁已经来到。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.4.htm">63:4</a>）<br />撒但被捆绑“一千年”（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.2.htm">20:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.7.htm">7</a>）和头一次复活的“一千年”（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.4.htm">20:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.6.htm">6</a>）也绝非表示一千年，而是表示他们的状态。因为如前所示，“日子”用来表示状态，“年”（或“岁”）也是，状态用年数来描述。因此显而易见，本章经文中的时间也涉及状态，因为每个教会皆照各自天赋、遗传与习得而处于不同的直觉状态。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]482.</strong> The inner meaning of the years and numbers of years that come up in this chapter is not as yet recognized by anyone. Those who concentrate on the literal meaning consider the years to be time-related, but none of the chapters from here to the twelfth contains any history that is literally accurate. Each and every detail instead has a different kind of content. As with the names [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_482/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_470" target=_top>470</a>], so also with the numbers.<br />The number three occurs frequently throughout the Word, as does the number seven, and each time they occur they symbolize something whose circumstances are holy or sacrosanct. The periods of time and other features involved entail or represent those circumstances. The meaning is the same for short periods as it is for long periods; just as the parts make up the whole, so the smallest fractions make up the largest aggregates. There has to be uniformity across the different magnitudes for a whole to develop out of the parts or for an aggregate to emerge from the pieces in a compatible way.<br />[2] In Isaiah, for example:<br />Now has Jehovah spoken, saying, "In three years (corresponding to a hired servant's years) the glory of Moab will be abased." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_482/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_16_14" target=_top>Isaiah 16:14</a>)<br />In the same author:<br />The Lord said to me, "In one more year (corresponding to a hired servant's years) all the glory of Kedar will be consumed." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_482/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_21_16" target=_top>Isaiah 21:16</a>)<br />This means both the shortest and the longest periods. In Habakkuk:<br />Jehovah, I have heard of your fame; I have been awed, Jehovah, by your work. In the middle of the years, bring it to life. In the middle of the years, please make it known. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_482/bible_king-james-version_habakkuk_3_2" target=_top>Habakkuk 3:2</a>)<br />The middle of the years stands for the Lord's Coming. In regard to shorter periods, it stands for every instance in which the Lord comes — when we are being reborn, for example. In regard to somewhat longer periods, it stands for a time when the Lord's church rises up anew. Isaiah also calls this the year of the redeemed:<br />The day of vengeance is in my heart, and the year of my redeemed has come. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_482/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_63_4" target=_top>Isaiah 63:4</a>)<br />The thousand years in which Satan was to be fettered (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_482/bible_king-james-version_revelation_20_2-3" target=_top>Revelation 20:2-3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_482/bible_king-james-version_revelation_20_7" target=_top>7</a>) and the thousand years of the first resurrection (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_482/bible_king-james-version_revelation_20_4-5" target=_top>Revelation 20:4-5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_482/bible_king-james-version_revelation_20_6" target=_top>6</a>) likewise mean not a thousand years but the state of those people. Just as a day is taken to refer to a state, as shown before [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_482/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_23" target=_top>23</a>], so are years; and the number of years describes the states in some way. This clarifies the fact that the intervals mentioned in this chapter also involve the prevailing states, since the state of perception in each church was different from that in another. The differences in their ability to perceive was a result of differences in character — both inherited character and character developed through living. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 482</b></p><p><b>482.</b>
What the "years" and the "numbers of years" which occur in this chapter, signify in the internal sense, has hitherto been unknown. Those who abide in the literal sense suppose them to be secular years, 
whereas from this to the twelfth chapter there is nothing historical according to its appearance in the literal sense, but all things in general and every single thing in particular contain other matters. 
And this is the case not only with the names, but also with the numbers. In the Word frequent mention is made of the number three, and also of the number seven, and wheresoever they occur they 
signify something holy or most sacred in regard to the states which the times or other things involve or represent; and they have the same signification in the least intervals of time as in the greatest, 
for as the parts belong to the whole, so the least things belong to the greatest, for there must be a likeness in order that the whole may properly come forth from the parts, or the greatest from 
its leasts. Thus in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Now hath Jehovah spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of a hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be rendered worthless (Isa. 16:14).      Again: </p>
<p>     Thus 
hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall be consumed (Isa. 21:16), where both the least and the greatest intervals are signified. 
in Habakkuk: </p>
<p>     Jehovah, I have heard Thy renown, and was afraid; O Jehovah, revive Thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known (Hab. 3:2),where the "midst of the 
years" signifies the Lord's advent. In lesser intervals it signifies every coming of the Lord, as when man is being regenerated; in greater, when the church of the Lord is arising anew. It is likewise 
called the "year of the redeemed" in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The day of vengeance is in My heart, and the year of My redeemed is come (Isa. 63:4). So also the thousand years in which Satan was to be bound 
(Rev. 20:2, 7), and the thousand years of the first resurrection (Rev. 20:4-6), by no means signify a thousand years, but their states; for as "days" are used to express states, as shown above, so also 
are "years," and the states are described by the number of the years. Hence it is evident that the times in this chapter also involve states; for every church was in a different state of perception 
from the rest, according to the differences of genius, hereditary and acquired. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 482</b></p><p><b>482.</b>
Until now nobody has known what the years and the numbers of years occurring in this chapter mean in the internal sense. People who stay within the sense of the letter imagine that they are no more than 
chronological years. But none of the content from here down to Chapter 12 is history as it seems to be in the sense of the letter, for every single detail contains something of a different nature. 
What applies to names applies to numbers as well. In the Word the number three occurs frequently, and so does the number seven; and in every instance they mean something holy or inviolable as regards 
those states which the periods of time or whatever else that is mentioned embody or represent. This applies as much to the shortest as to the longest time-intervals; for just as parts makeup the whole, 
so do the shortest make up the longest. For a similarity must exist in order that a whole may emerge satisfactorily out of the parts, or that which is largest out of that which is smallest.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
As in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah has now spoken, saying, In three years, according to the years of a hireling, the glory of Moab will be rendered worthless. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2016:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 16:14</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
The Lord 
said to me, Within yet a year, according to the years of a hireling, and all the glory of Kedar will be brought to an end. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2021:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 21:6</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here both the shortest as well as the longest time-intervals 
are meant. In Habakkuk,  </p>
<blockquote>
O Jehovah, I have heard Your fame; I was afraid. O Jehovah, revive Your work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years do You make it known. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hab%203:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hab 3:2</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the 
midst of the years' stands for the Lord's Coming. If the intervals are shorter this stands for every coming of the Lord, as when a person is being regenerated; but if longer it stands for the rising 
anew of the Lord's Church. It is also called in Isaiah 'the year of the redeemed', The day of vengeance was in My heart, and the year of My redeemed has come. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2063:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 63:4</a>. </p>
<p>So too 'the thousand years' 
for which Satan is to be bound, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2020:2,%203,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 20:2, 3, 7</a>, and 'the thousand years' associated with the first resurrection, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2020:4-6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 20:4-6</a>. These in no way mean a thousand years but the states associated with 
them. For just as 'days, as shown 'already, are interpreted as a state, so too are 'years', and the states are described by the number of the years. From this it becomes clear that periods of time in 
this chapter also embody states, for every Church experienced a different state of perception from the next, according to differences of disposition resulting from inherited and acquired characteristics.  </p>

Quid anni et numeri annorum qui in hoc capite occurrunt in interno sensu significant, nondum alicui notum est; qui in sensu litterae sunt, ii putant annos esse saeculares; sed hic usque ad cap. xli 
nihil historicum, sicut in sensu litterae apparet, continetur, sed omni: et singula continent alia; sicut nomina, ita quoque numeri. In Verbo occurrit passim numerus ternarius, tum quoque septenarius, 
et ubique significant aliquod sanctum seu sacrosanctum quoad status, quos tempora aut alia involvunt aut repraesentant; simile in minimus inter vallis ac in maximis, nam sicut partes sunt totius, ita 
minima sunt maximorum; nam similiter se habebunt, ut totum ex partibus aut maximum a minimus convenienter existat; [2] ut apud Esaiam, 	Nunc locutus est Jehovah dicendo, In tribus annis, secundum annos 
mercenarii, et vitis reddetur gloria Moabi, xvi 	14: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Dixit Dominus ad me, In adhuc anno, juxta annos mercenarii, et consumetur omnis gloria Kedaris, xxi 16; </p>
<p>ubi significantur tam 
minima quam maxima intervalla:  apud Habakkuk, 	Jehovah, audivi famam Tuam, reveritus sum, Jehovah, opus Tuum, in medio annorum vivifica illud, in medio annorum nota 	facias, iii 2; </p>
<p>ubi 'medium annorum' 
pro Adventu Domini; etiam in minoribus intervallis pro omni Domini adventu, ut cum regeneratur homo; in majoribus, dum e novo Ecclesia Domini exsurgit. Vocatur etiam 'annus redemptorum,' apud Esaiam, 	Dies 
ultionis in corde Meo, et annus redemptorum Meorum venit, lxiii 4; </p>
<p>sicut etiam 'anni millenarii' quibus vinctus erit satanas, Apoc. xx 2, {x}3, 7; et 'mille anni' resurrectionis primae, Apoc. 
xx 4-6, nusquam significant mille annos, sed status eorum; nam sicut 'dies,' ut prius ostensum, etiam 'anni' pro statu accipiuntur, et status describuntur per numerum annorum.  Inde constare potest 
quod tempora in hoc capite involvant quoque status, nam unaquaevis Ecclesia in alio statu perceptionis fuit quam altera, secundum differentias indolis ex hereditario et actuali. </p>
