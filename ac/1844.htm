<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1844节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1844.</strong>“别人的地”表那里会有一个可以说由不具有仁与信之人组成的教会。这从“地”的含义清楚可知，“地”表示教会（参看<a href="566.htm">566</a>，<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>，<a href="1068.htm">1068</a>节）。如今，人们仅凭信之教义谈论教会，并由此区分主的教会，全然不顾人们所过的生活如何。无论他们心存仇恨，还是象野兽那样彼此撕裂，互相抢劫，并发自内心否认圣物。然而，这种人根本没有教会可言，教会只与那些爱主和爱邻如己之人同在，他们有良知，反对并远离上述仇恨。不过，这些人在前面所描述的那些人当中就象寄居的，最有可能受到虐待和迫害，要不就被视为简单、下贱、一无是处。这就是“你的种必寄居在别人的地”所表示的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1844.</strong> In a land that is not theirs symbolizes places where it would not seem as if the church belonged to those who had charity and faith. This can be seen from the symbolism of the earth as the church, as discussed in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1844/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566" target=_top>566</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1844/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_662" target=_top>662</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1844/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1066" target=_top>1066</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1844/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1068" target=_top>1068</a>.<br />Today people describe the church solely in terms of religious teachings, which they use as a means of distinguishing among the Lord's churches.{*1} They do not care how adherents of those churches live — whether they nurse hatred for each other, rip each other apart like wild animals, rob each other, strip each other of reputation and status and wealth, or privately deny all that is holy. Yet the church can never exist in such people. It exists instead in people who love the Lord, love their neighbor as themselves, have a conscience, and oppose the kinds of hatred mentioned. These people, though, are like foreigners among the others, who skewer and harass them as often as they can, or else look on them as sorry, contemptible simpletons. This, then, is what it means to say, "Your seed will be immigrants in the land."<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} By "the Lord's churches" Swedenborg presumably means all the Christian denominations of his time.

In a land which is not theirs. That this signifies where there is a church that is as it were not composed of those who are in charity and faith, is evident from the signification of "a land," as being 
the church (see n. 566, 662, 1066, 1067). At this day men speak of the church as existing from the mere doctrinals of faith, and thereby distinguish the churches of the Lord, not caring what life men 
live-whether they cherish inward hatreds, and tear one another like wild beasts, rob one another, and deprive others of reputation, honor, and wealth, and at heart deny whatever is holy. And yet with 
such there is no church at all; but the church is with those who love the Lord, and who love the neighbor as themselves, who have conscience, and are averse to such hatreds as have been mentioned. 
But among those previously described these men are like strangers, and are treated with the utmost possible abuse and persecution, or else are regarded as being simple, mean, and of no account. This then 
is what is meant by "thy seed shall be a stranger in the land." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1844</b></p><p><b>1844.</b>
'In a land that is not theirs' means where there will be a Church which does not so to speak consist of people in whom charity and faith are present. This is clear from the meaning of 'the land' as the 
Church, dealt with in <a href="566.htm">566</a>, <a href="662.htm">662</a>, <a href="1066.htm">1066</a>, <a href="1068.htm">1068</a>. At the present day people speak of doctrinal matters of faith, these alone, as the things which make the Church; and it is on the basis of these that they 
distinguish the Lord's Churches from one another. They are not concerned about the kind of life people lead, whether or not they foment inner hatred and like wild animals tear one another apart, violently 
rob one another, deprive one another of reputation, position, and wealth, and at heart deny whatever is holy. The Church however does not exist in any way with people who are like this but with 
those who love the Lord and their neighbour as themselves, who have conscience, and who turn away from the kinds of hatred that have been mentioned. When the latter with whom the Church in fact exists 
are among the others described above they are like 'strangers', and they are subjected by these others to every possible insult and persecution, or are regarded by them as being simple, insignificant, 
and worthless. This then is what is meant by 'your seed will be strangers in the land'. </p>

</p><b>1844.</b>
'In terra quae non illis': quod significet ubi Ecclesia, sicut non foret illorum qui in charitate et fide, constat ex significatione 'terrae' quod sit Ecclesia, de qua n. 566, 662, 1066, (x)1068.  Hodie 
Ecclesiam praedicant ex solis doctrinalibus fidei, et ex illis distinguunt Ecclesias Domini, non curantes quali vita sint, sive odia intestina foveant, et sicut ferae unus alterum dilanient, spolient, 
deprivent fama, honore, opibus, et corde negent quicquid sanctum est; cum tamen apud tales nusquam est Ecclesia sed apud illos qui Dominum amant et proximum sicut semet, conscientiam habent, et 
talia odia de quibus dictum, aversantur; hi usque inter illos sunt sicut 'peregrini,' et eos quantum possunt, dicteriis laedunt et persequuntur, vel spectant illos sicut simplices, viles et nauci; hoc 
nunc est quod 'peregrinum erit semen tuum in terra.' </p>
