<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9648节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9648.</strong>“居所的另一面，就是北边”表朝向该天堂的外层，真理在此住在模糊中。这从“居所”和“北边”的含义清楚可知：“居所”是指天堂（参看<a href="9594.htm">9594</a>节）；“北边”是指外层，真理在此住在模糊中（<a href="3708.htm">3708</a>节）。从这些含义明显可知，“居所的另一面，就是北边”表示朝向天堂的外层，真理在此住在模糊中。世上的四个方位，即东、南、西、北，对应四种状态。东对应于良善上升的一种状态，西对应于良善下降的一种状态，南对应于真理住在光中的状态，北对应于真理住在阴暗中的状态（<a href="3708.htm">3708</a>节）。东所对应的良善状态和南所对应的真理状态是更内在的状态；西所对应的良善状态和北所对应的真理状态是更外在的状态。因为每种状态越内在，就越完美；越外在，就越不完美，因而越模糊。这就是为何一个人朝更内在的事物被提升得越高，就越进入对良善的觉知和真理之光。因此，当一个人脱去肉体事物，就是真正的外在事物时，如他离开这个世界时的情形，他若过着真理和良善的生活，就会进入聪明和智慧，从而进入对一切幸福的感知之中。他越通过过一种基于真理教义的良善生活而允许自己被提升到天堂的更内在部分，这种感知就越大。</p>

And for the other side of the Habitation at the corner of the north. That this signifies toward the exteriors of this heaven where truths are in obscurity, is evident from the signification of "the Habitation," 
as being heaven (see n. 9594); and from the signification of "the north," as being the exteriors in which truth is in obscurity (n. 3708). From this it is plain that by "the side of the Habitation 
at the corner of the north," is signified toward the exteriors of heaven, where truth is in obscurity. There are four states to which the four quarters in the world, namely, the east, the west, 
the south, and the north, correspond. The east corresponds to a state of good in its rising, the west to a state of good in its going down; the south corresponds to a state of truth in its light; and 
the north to a state of truth in shade (n. 3708). The state of good to which the east corresponds, and the state of truth to which the south corresponds, are interior states; and the state of good 
to which the west corresponds, and the state of truth to which the north corresponds, are exterior; for the more interior any state is, the more perfect it is; and the more exterior it is, the more imperfect, 
thus the more obscure. It is for this reason that the higher a man can be raised toward interior things, the more he comes into the perception of good, and into the light of truth; and therefore 
when a man puts off bodily things, which are the veriest external things, as is the case when he departs out of the world; if he has lived a life of truth and good he comes into intelligence and wisdom, 
and thus into the perception of every happiness; and into a perception the greater, in proportion as through a life of good from the doctrine of truth he has suffered himself to be raised toward 
the interior things of heaven. </p>

'And for the other side of the dwelling-place - on the north side' means towards the more external parts of that heaven, where truth dwells in obscurity. This is clear from the meaning of 'the dwelling-place' 
as heaven, dealt with in <a href="9594.htm">9594</a>; and from the meaning of 'the north' as more external parts, where truth dwells in obscurity, dealt with in <a href="3708.htm">3708</a>. From these meanings it is evident that 'the side 
of the dwelling-place - on the north side' means towards the more external parts of heaven, where truth dwells in obscurity. There are four states to which the four quarters in the world - east, west, 
south, and north - correspond. East corresponds to a state in which good is on the rise, and west to a state in which good is on the decline; south corresponds to a state in which truth dwells in 
light, but north to a state in which truth dwells in shade, <a href="3708.htm">3708</a>. The state of good which the east corresponds to, and the state of truth which the south corresponds to, are more internal states, while 
the state of good which the west and that of truth which the north correspond to are more external states. For the more internal every state is, the more perfect it is; and the more external it is, 
the less perfect and so more obscure it is. This is why the higher a person can be raised towards more internal things, the more he advances into the perception of good and the light of truth. When therefore 
a person lays aside things of the body, which are truly external things, as happens when he leaves this world, he enters into intelligence and wisdom, and so into the perception of all forms of 
happiness. He does so provided that he has been leading a life of truth and goodness. And the more he has allowed himself to be raised towards the more internal parts of heaven by leading a good life 
based on teachings about the truth, the greater is that perception.  </p>

`Et lateri habitaculi alteri ad angulum septentrionis': quod significet versus exteriora illius caeli ubi verum {1} in obscuro, constat ex significatione `habitaculi' quod sit caelum, de qua n. 9594, 
et ex significatione `septentrionis' quod sint exteriora ubi verum in obscuro, de qua n. 3708; inde patet quod per `latus habitaculi ad angulum septentrionis' significetur versus exteriora caeli ubi 
verum in obscuro.  Sunt quattuor status quibus correspondent quattuor plagae in mundo, quae sunt {2} oriens, occidens, meridies, et septentrio; oriens correspondet {3} statui boni in suo ortu, occidens 
{4} statui boni in suo occasu, meridies correspondet statui veri in sua luce, septentrio autem statui veri in umbra {5}, n. 3708; status boni cui correspondet oriens, et status veri cui correspondet 
meridies, sunt (o)status interiore et {6} status boni cui correspondet occidens, et status veri cui septentrio, sunt exteriores, nam omnis status quo interior eo perfectior, et quo exterior eo imperfectior, 
ita obscurior; inde est quod homo, quo altius versus interiora elevari potest eo magis in perceptionem boni ac in lucem veri perveniat; quapropter homo quando exuit corporea, qua sunt (o)ipsa
