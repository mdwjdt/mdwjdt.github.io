<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6640节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6640.</strong>“流便、西缅、利未、犹大、以萨迦、西布伦、便雅悯、但、拿弗他利、迦得、亚设”表从开始到结束的整个过程，也就是说，教会建立的整个过程，也是下文所描述的主题。这从雅各的十二个儿子和以他们命名的各个支派的含义清楚可知，雅各的十二个儿子和以他们命名的各个支派是指总体上良善与真理的全部事物，也就是爱与信的全部事物（参看<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="3926.htm">3926</a>，<a href="3939.htm">3939</a>，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>，<a href="6335.htm">6335</a>节）。然而，这些含义照着这些名字所提及的顺序而发生变化（参看<a href="3862.htm">3862</a>，<a href="3926.htm">3926</a>，<a href="3939.htm">3939</a>，<a href="4603.htm">4603</a>等节）。因此，这些变化就是构成主的教会和国度的无数和每一个事物（<a href="6337.htm">6337</a>节）。但至于它们以这种或那种顺序被提及时具体表示什么，没有人知道，唯独主知道；若不通过主，就连天上的人也不知道；在天堂，所表示的真理与良善通过与觉知联结的光而从视觉上被呈现出来。<br />由于十二支派代表主的国度和那里的一切事物，故为使得这些光也能被代表，教会的一切真理与良善则由此被代表，十二颗宝石按顺序被镶在金槽中，一个支派一颗宝石；这个被称为“胸牌”，系在亚伦的以弗得上；他们通过光的不同闪烁而从它那里得到答案，这一切还伴随着听得见的话语或一种内在觉知。由此也明显可知，以色列的十二个支派表示整体上主国度和教会的全部真理和良善，并且含义照着提及他们的顺序而各不相同。此处提及他们的顺序不同于他们出生的顺序，这一点从以下事实明显看出来：以萨迦和西布伦先于但和拿弗他利被提及，尽管后者先于他们出生。便雅悯先于但、拿弗他利、迦得、亚设而被提及，而他却是最后出生的；迦得、亚设则是最后被提及。这一点同样从圣言中以不同顺序提及他们的其它地方明显看出来。</p>

Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin; Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher. That these signify this process from beginning to end, namely, that of the setting up anew of the church, 
to be described in what follows, is evident from the signification of the sons of Jacob, and also of the tribes named from them, as being all things of good and of truth, that is, all things of 
love and of faith, in the complex (see n. 3858, 3926, 3939, 4060, 6335); but with variety according to the order in which they are named (see n. 3862, 3926, 3939, 4603 seq.); thus things innumerable, 
and all things of the Lord's church and kingdom both in general and in particular (n. 6337). But what they specifically signify when named in this or in another order, no one knows but the Lord alone, 
nor anyone in heaven but from the Lord, where the truths and goods which are signified are shown by means of lights to which is adjoined perception. [2] As the twelve tribes represented the Lord's kingdom 
and all things therein, therefore in order that these lights also might be represented, and thereby all the truths and goods of the church, twelve precious stones in their order were engraved and 
set in gold, one stone for each tribe, and this was called the "breastplate," and was placed on Aaron's ephod, and from this by varying flashes of light they received answers, to which was adjoined 
either a living voice, or an internal perception. Hence also it is evident that the twelve tribes of Israel signify all the truths and goods of the Lord's kingdom and church in the complex, and this 
variously according to the order in which they are named. That they are here named in another order than that of birth, is plain from the fact that Issachar and Zebulun are named before Dan and Naphtali, 
though the latter were born before them; also Benjamin before Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher, when yet Benjamin was born last; also that Gad and Asher are named last of all. In like manner in other 
parts of the Word, where they are named in still different orders. </p>

'Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin; Dan and Naphtali, Cad and Asher' means the whole process from start to finish, that is to say, of the establishment of the Church, which 
is the subject in what follows next. For the twelve sons of Jacob, and the tribes named after them too, mean all aspects of goodness and truth, that is, all aspects of love and faith in their entirety, 
see <a href="3858.htm">3858</a>, <a href="3926.htm">3926</a>, <a href="3939.htm">3939</a>, <a href="4060.htm">4060</a>, <a href="6335.htm">6335</a>. Yet these meanings vary according to the order in which the names are mentioned, <a href="3862.htm">3862</a>, <a href="3926.htm">3926</a>, <a href="3939.htm">3939</a>, <a href="4603.htm">4603</a> and following paragraphs. The variations are therefore 
countless and involve every single thing that constitutes the Church and the Lord's kingdom, <a href="6737.htm">6737</a>. But what the specific meaning is when the names occur in the present or any other order nobody knows 
but the Lord alone. Nor does anyone in heaven know unless the Lord makes it known; in heaven the truths and forms of good that are meant are presented visually by means of lights, together with a perception 
of what the lights mean. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The twelve tribes represented the Lord's kingdom and everything there, and therefore in order that those lights might also be represented, and thereby all the Church's 
truths and forms of good, twelve precious stones were set<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> in gold in their proper order, one stone for each tribe. This was called the breastplate and was attached to Aaron's ephod; and they received 
answers from it by means of the varying flashes of light, which were accompanied either by audible words or by inner perception. From this too it may be recognized that the twelve tribes of Israel 
mean all the truths and forms of good, in their entirety, of the Lord's kingdom and the Church, and that the meanings vary, depending on the order in which they are mentioned. Here they are mentioned 
in a different order from that in which they were born, as is evident from the fact that Issachar and Zebulun are mentioned before Dan and Naphtali, though the latter were born before the former. 
Benjamin too is mentioned before Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher, and yet he was born last; and Gad and Asher are mentioned last of all. Something similar is evident in other places in the Word where the 
names occur in further variations of order.

`Reuben, Schimeon, Levi, et Jehudah; Jisaschar, Sebulun, et Benjamin; Dan et Naphtali, Gad et Ascher': quod significent processum a principio ad finem, nempe instaurationis Ecclesiae, de qua in sequentibus 
nunc agitur; {1}`duodecim enim' filii Jacobi, ut quoque tribus ab illis nominatae, significant omnia boni et veri, hoc est, omnia amoris et fidei in complexu, videatur n. 3858, 3926, 3939, 4060, 
6335, sed varia secundum ordinem in quo nominantur, n. 3862, 3926, 3939, 4603 seq.; et quod ita innumerabilia, ac omnia et singula quae sunt Ecclesiae {2}et regni Domini, n. 6337; sed quid in specie 
significant cum in tali vel alio ordine nominantur, nemo scit quam solus Dominus, nec aliquis in caelo nisi a Domino, ubi vera et bona, quae significantur, per luces cum adjuncta perceptione manifestantur. 	2 
{3}Quia duodecim tribus repraesentabant regnum Domini et omnia {4} quae ibi, ideo ut quoque luces illae repraesentarentur, et sic omnia vera et bona Ecclesiae, duodecim lapides pretiosi in 
suo ordine insculpti sunt auro, unus lapis pro unaquavis tribu, et id pectorale vocatum est, ac impositum ephodo Aharonis, ac inde per effulgurationes varias lucis tulerunt responsa, quibus adjuncta fuit 
vel viva vox, vel perceptio interna; inde quoque constare potest quod `duodecim tribus Israelis' significent vera et bona regni Domini ac Ecclesiae omnia in complexu et quod varia secundum ordinem 
in quo nominantur.  Quod hic in alio ordine nominentur quam secundum nativitates, patet ex eo quod Jisaschar et Sebulun prius nominentur quam Dan et Naphtali, tametsi hi prius nati sunt; et quoque Benjamin 
ante Danem, Naphtali, Gadem et Ascherem, qui tamen ultimo natus est; tum quod Gad et Ascher post omnes; similiter alibi in Verbo ubi adhuc alio ordine nominantur. 	@1 A had this, then deleted
