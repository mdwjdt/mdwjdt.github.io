<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5136节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5136.</strong>“从希伯来人之地”表与教会，也就是说，邪恶使得属天事物与教会疏远。这从“希伯来人之地”的含义清楚可知，“希伯来人之地”是指教会。“希伯来人之地”在此是指迦南地；因为约瑟就是那里被拐走的。在圣言中，迦南地之所以表示教会，是因为教会自上古时代就一直在那里，最初是大洪水之前的上古教会；然后是大洪水之后的古教会；后来是第二代古教会，也就是所谓的希伯来教会；最后是犹太教会。为使犹太教会能建在那里，亚伯兰被吩咐从叙利亚或亚兰迁到那地，在那里被应许这地会作为产业赐给他的后裔。这解释了为何在圣言中，“地”或“陆地”表示教会，“全地”（这个词出现在各个地方）表示普遍的教会，以及“新天新地”表示一个内在和外在的新教会。<br />教会之所以自上古时代起就一直在那里，是因为属天的上古教会成员是那种在世界和地上的每一个事物里面都能看到代表主国度的某种事物的人。世界和地上的物体对他来说，就是思想天上事物的手段。这就是后来古教会所知的一切代表和有意义符号的来源，因为它们被“以诺”所指的人收集并保存起来，以备后世所用（<a href="519.htm">519</a>，<a href="521.htm">521</a>，<a href="2896.htm">2896</a>节）。这就是上古之人所住的迦南地的每个地方，以及每座山、每条河，同样周围的所有国家都成为代表的来由。由于圣言若不用代表和有意义的符号，包括那些与地方有关的，就无法写成，所以为了这个目的，教会一直保存在迦南地。但主到来之后，教会就被转到别的地方，因为那时代表被废除了。综上所述，明显可知在此被称为“希伯来人之地”的迦南地表示教会。<br />不过，可参看前面关于这些问题的阐述或引证，即：大洪水之前的上古教会在迦南地（<a href="567.htm">567</a>，<a href="3686.htm">3686</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="4454.htm">4454</a>节）；大洪水后的教会，即古教会的一部分在那里（参看<a href="3686.htm">3686</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>节）；被称为希伯来教会的第二代古教会也在那里（<a href="4516.htm">4516</a>，<a href="4517.htm">4517</a>节）；由于同样的原因，亚伯兰被吩咐到那里，那地被赐给他的后裔 （<a href="3686.htm">3686</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>节）；迦南地由此代表主的国度（<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="3038.htm">3038</a>，<a href="3481.htm">3481</a>，<a href="3705.htm">3705</a>，<a href="4240.htm">4240</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>节）；正因如此，在圣言中，“地”或“陆地”表示教会（参看<a href="566.htm">566</a>，<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>，<a href="1068.htm">1068</a>，<a href="1262.htm">1262</a>，<a href="1413.htm">1413</a>，<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>，<a href="3355.htm">3355</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="4535.htm">4535</a>节）。</p>

Out of the land of the Hebrews. That this signifies from the church, namely, that celestial things were alienated from it through evil, is evident from the signification of the "land of the Hebrews," 
as being the church. The "land of the Hebrews" here, is the land of Canaan; for Joseph was taken away from there. The reason why the land of Canaan in the Word signifies the church, is that the church 
has been there from the most ancient time: first the Most Ancient Church, which was before the flood; next the Ancient Church, which was after the flood; afterward the Second Ancient Church, which was 
called the Hebrew Church; and at last the Jewish Church. And in order that the Jewish Church might be instituted there, Abram was commanded to betake himself thither out of Syria, and it was there 
promised him that this land should be given to his posterity for an inheritance. This is the reason why "land" or "earth" in the Word signifies the church, and the "whole earth," as sometimes occurs, 
the universal church; and also the "new heaven and new earth," a new church internal and external. 
 </p>
<p>[2] The reason why the church was continued there from the most ancient time, is that the man of the 
Most Ancient Church, who was celestial, was of such a character that in each and all things in the world and upon the earth he saw a representative of the Lord's kingdom; the objects of the world and 
the earth being to him the means of thinking about heavenly things. This was the origin of all the representatives and significatives that were afterward known in the Ancient Church, for they were collected 
by those who are meant by "Enoch," and were preserved for the use of posterity (n. 519, 521, 2896). From this it came to pass that every place, and also every mountain and river, in the land of 
Canaan, where the most ancient people dwelt, and likewise all the kingdoms round about, became representative; and as the Word could not be written except by representatives and significatives, even 
of places, therefore for the sake of this end the church was successively preserved in the land of Canaan; but after the coming of the Lord it was transferred elsewhere, because representatives were 
then abolished. 
 </p>
<p>[3] From the foregoing it is plain that by the land of Canaan, which is here called the "land of the Hebrews," is signified the church; but see what has been previously adduced on these 
subjects; namely, that the Most Ancient Church, which was before the flood, was in the land of Canaan (n. 567, 3686, 4447, 4454); that part of the Ancient Church, which was after the flood, was there 
(see n. 3686, 4447); also that a second Ancient Church, which was called the Hebrew Church, was there (n. 4516, 4517); that for the same reason Abram was commanded to go there, and that land was given 
to his posterity (n. 3686, 4447); that from this the land of Canaan represented the Lord's kingdom (n. 1607, 3038, 3481, 3705, 4240, 4447); and that it is for this reason that by "earth" or "land" 
in the Word is signified the church (see n. 566, 662, 1066, 1068, 1262, 1413, 1607, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 3355, 4447, 4535). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5136</b></p><p><b>5136.</b>
'Out of the land of the Hebrews' means from the Church; that is to say, evil caused celestial things to be alienated from it. This is clear from the meaning of 'the land of the Hebrews' as the Church, 
'the land of the Hebrews' being in this case the land of Canaan, for this was the place from which Joseph was taken away. The reason why in the Word 'the land of Canaan' means the Church is that the 
Church had existed there since most ancient times, first the Most Ancient Church, which came before the Flood; then the Ancient Church, which came after the Flood; after that the second Ancient Church, 
which is called the Hebrew Church; and at length the Jewish Church. So that the Jewish Church might be established there Abram was commanded to move from Syria to that land, where he received the promise 
that the land would be given as an inheritance to his descendants. This explains why in the Word 'land' or 'earth' means the Church, and 'the whole land' - an expression found in various places 
- the universal Church, and why 'a new heaven and a new earth' means a new Church, internal and external. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason the Church existed there continuously since most ancient times was that the 
member of the Most Ancient Church, who was celestial, was the kind of person who saw within every single object in the world and on earth something representative of the Lord's kingdom. Worldly and earthly 
objects were the means that enabled him to think about heavenly realities. This was where all the representatives and meaningful signs known subsequently in the Ancient Church had their origin, 
for these had been gathered together by the people meant by 'Enoch', and preserved for the use of others descended from them, <a href="519.htm">519</a>, <a href="521.htm">521</a>, <a href="2896.htm">2896</a>. This was how it came about that each specific place, and 
also each specific mountain or river in the land of Canaan, where the most ancient people lived, came to be representative, as did all the surrounding kingdoms. Now because the Word could not be written 
unless representatives and meaningful signs were used, including those connected with places, those consecutive dispensations of the Church were to that end kept in existence in the land of Canaan. 
But after the Lord's Coming the Church was transferred elsewhere because representatives were now done away with. From all this it is evident that the land of Canaan, called the land of the Hebrews here, 
means the Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But see what has been presented already on these matters - in the following places: </p>
<p> The Most Ancient Church, the one before the Flood, existed in the land of Canaan, <a href="567.htm">567</a>, <a href="3686.htm">3686</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="4454.htm">4454</a>. </p>
<p>Part of the Ancient Church, the Church after the Flood, existed there, <a href="3686.htm">3686</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>. </p>
<p>The second Ancient Church, called the Hebrew Church, also existed there, <a href="4516.htm">4516</a>, <a href="4517.htm">4517</a>. </p>
<p>Abram 
was therefore commanded to go there, and the land was given to his descendants, <a href="3686.htm">3686</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>. </p>
<p>Consequently the land of Canaan represented the Lord's kingdom, <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>, <a href="3038.htm">3038</a>, <a href="3481.htm">3481</a>, <a href="3705.htm">3705</a>, <a href="4240.htm">4240</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>. </p>
<p>This 
explains why in the Word 'the land' means the Church, <a href="566.htm">566</a>, <a href="662.htm">662</a>, <a href="1066.htm">1066</a>, <a href="1067.htm">1067</a>, <a href="1262.htm">1262</a>, <a href="1413.htm">1413</a>, <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>, <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="1850.htm">1850</a>, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>, <a href="2118.htm">2118</a> (end), <a href="3355.htm">3355</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="4535.htm">4535</a>. </p>

`E terra Hebraeorum': quod significet ab Ecclesia, quod nempe caelestia abalienata sint per malum, constat a significatione terrae Hebraeorum' quod sit Ecclesia; terra Hebraeorum hic est terra Canaan, 
nam inde Josephum ablatus est.  Quod per `terram Canaanem' in Verbo significetur Ecclesia, est quia ibi ab antiquissimo tempore fuerat Ecclesia, primum Ecclesia Antiquissima quae (o)fuit ante 
diluvium, dein Ecclesia Antiqua quae (o)fuit post diluvium, postea Ecclesia Judaica; utque Ecclesia Judaica ibi institueretur, mandatum est Abramo ut illuc ex Syria se conferret, et ibi promissum 
quod posteritati ejus daretur illa terra in hereditatem; inde est quod per `terram' in Verbo significetur Ecclesia, et per `universam terram ut passim legitur, universa Ecclesia, et quoque per `novum 
caelum et novam terram' Ecclesia nova interna et externa: [2] causa quod ibi Ecclesia continuata ab antiquissimo tempore fuerit, erat quia homo Antiquissimae Ecclesiae qui caelestis, talis erat 
ut in omnibus singulis quae in mundo et super terra, viderit repraesentativum regni Domini; objecta mundi et telluris erant ei media cogitandi de caelestibus, inde omnia repraesentativa et significativa 
quae postea in Ecclesia Antiqua nota fuerunt, ortum duxerunt, collecta enim fuerunt ab illis qui intelliguntur per Hanoch, et conservata in usum posteritatum, n. 519, 521, 2896, inde factum 
quod singula loca et quoque singuli montes et fluvii in terra Canaane ubi habitabant antiquissimi, repraesentativi facti sint, et quoque omnia regna circumcirca; et quia Verbum non potuit aliter conscribi 
quam [per] repraesentativa et significativa, etiam locorum, ideo propter illum finem Ecclesia successive conservata est in terra Canaane; at post Adventum Domini aliunde translata et quia tunc 
repraesentativa abolita sunt; ex his patet quod per terram (o)Canaanem, quae hi vocatur terra Hebraeorum, significetur Ecclesia.  [3] Sed videantur qua de his prius allata sunt, nempe quod Ecclesia 
Antiquissima quae fuit ante diluvium, in terra Canaane fuerit, n. 567, 3686, 4447, 4454: quod pars Antiquae Ecclesiae quae post diluvium, ibi fuerit, n. 3686, 4447 quod etiam (o)Altera Antiqua 
Ecclesia quae dicta Hebraea n. 4516, 4517 quod Abram ideo illuc ire jussus sit, et data posteri ejus, n. 3686, 4447: quod ex eo terra Canaan repraesentaverit regnum Domini, p. 1607, 3038, 3481, 3705, 
4240, 4447 et quod inde sit quod per terram in Verbo significetur Ecclesia, n. 566, 662, 1066, 1067, 1261, 1413, 1607, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118 f, 3355, 4447, 4535. </p>
