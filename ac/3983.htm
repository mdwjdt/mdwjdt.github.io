<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3983节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3983.</strong>“雅各对他说，你知道我怎样服事你”表它知道自己的心智和能力。这从内义上的思路清楚可知。显然，知道某人的性质，就知道他的心智。知道某人在其服务中的性质，或“我怎样服事你”就是知道他的能力；这一点从此处“服事”的含义可以看出来，“服事”是指人自己的能力（<a href="3975.htm">3975</a>，<a href="3977.htm">3977</a>节）。因为“雅各”代表主的神性属世层的真理之良善，这真理的良善拥有能力。由此可知“你的牲畜在我这里怎样”表示这也源于神性。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3983</b></p><p><b>3983.</b>
And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee. That this signifies that it had known its mind [animus], and its power, may be seen from the series of things in the internal sense. That to 
know anyone's quality is to know his mind, is manifest. And that knowing anyone's quality in his service, or "how I have served," is to know his power, may be seen from the signification here of "serving," 
as being one's own power (see n. 3975, 3977); for by Jacob is represented the Lord's Divine natural as to the good of truth, which has power. From this it follows that "how thy substance* has been 
with me" signifies that this also was from the Divine. * Acquisitio. The Hebrew mikneh means "what is acquired," but is limited to cattle. [Rotch ed.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3983</b></p><p><b>3983.</b>
'And [Jacob] said to him, You know how I have served you' means that it knew its mind and power. This becomes clear from the train of thought in the internal sense. 'Knowing what someone is like' clearly 
means knowing his mind, and so 'what one is like in his service' or 'how I have served you' means knowing his power, as may be seen from the meaning here of 'serving' as one's own power, dealt with 
in <a href="3975.htm">3975</a>, <a href="3977.htm">3977</a>. For 'Jacob' represents the Lord's Divine Natural as regards the good of truth, which possesses power. Consequently 'how your cattle have fared with me' also means originating in the Divine. </p>

</p><b>3983.</b>
`Et dixit ad eum, Tu nosti qualiter servivi tibi': quod significet quod noverit ejus animum et potentiam, `constare potest ex serie rerum in sensu interno; quod `nosse qualis sit' sit nosse animum, 
patet; et `qualis sit in servitio, seu qualiter servivi' quod sit nosse potentiam, constare potest a significatione `servire' hic quod sit propria potentia, de qua n. 3975, 3977; nam per `Jacobum' 
repraesentatur Divinum {1}Naturale Domini quoad bonum veri, cui potentia {2}: inde sequitur quod `qualis fuit acquisitio mecum' significet etiam ex Divino. @1 i et qualis fuit acquisitio tua mecum, 
quod significet etiam quod ex Divino$ @2 Naturalis I$ @3 i ut supra ostensum$ </p>
