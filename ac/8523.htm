Verses 32-34. And Moses said, This is the word which Jehovah hath commanded, Fill an omer with it to be kept for your generations, to the end that they may see the bread wherewith I fed you in the wilderness, 
when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt. And Moses said unto Aaron, Take an urn, and put the omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before Jehovah, to be kept for your generations. 
As Jehovah commanded Moses, and Aaron laid it up before the Testimony to be kept.  "And Moses said, This is the word which Jehovah hath commanded," signifies a mandate; "Fill an omer with it," signifies 
the highest degree of power; "to be kept for your generations," signifies which is for those who are of the spiritual church; "to the end that they may see the bread wherewith I fed you in the wilderness," 
signifies the good of truth when in a state of temptations; "when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt," signifies after they had been liberated from infestations; "and Moses said unto 
Aaron," signifies influx; "Take an urn," signifies truth; "and put the omer full of manna therein," signifies good therein as much as it will hold; "and lay it up before Jehovah," signifies that it 
may be in the presence of the Divine; "to be kept for your generations," signifies that it may be the measure for those who are of that spiritual church; "as Jehovah commanded Moses," signifies according 
to the mandate; "and Aaron laid it up before the Testimony to be kept," signifies that it was in the presence of the Divine. </p>
