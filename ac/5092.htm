<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5092节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5092.</strong>“是同夜各作一梦”表关于结果会是什么样，这结果对它们来说处于模糊状态。这从“梦”和“夜”的含义清楚可知：“梦”是指预见，因而是指预言，它表示预言，故也表示结果，因为它就是所预言的结果；“夜”是指模糊。“夜”在灵义上表示由邪恶所产生的虚假带来的幽暗状态（<a href="1712.htm">1712</a>，<a href="2353.htm">2353</a>节），因而表示模糊，也就是说，心智的模糊。在世上，夜间的模糊是属世的模糊；但在来世，夜间的模糊是属灵的模糊。前者是因缺乏尘世太阳，以及丧失从这太阳所得来的光造成的；而后者是因缺乏天堂的太阳，也就是主，以及丧失从这太阳所得来的光，也就是聪明造成的。后一种丧失不是因为天堂太阳像尘世太阳那样落下而造成的，而是因为世人或灵人活在邪恶所产生的虚假当中造成的。是他本人离开那太阳，给自己带来模糊。仅从这两种意义上夜及其模糊的观念就能明显看出，同一个事物，其属灵意义和属世意义如何彼此联系。此外，属灵的模糊有三种：第一种是由于邪恶所产生的虚假；第二种是由于对真理的无知；第三种是外层事物相对于内层事物所居的模糊，因而是外在人的感官事物相对于内在人的理性事物所居的模糊。然而，这三种模糊都是以下事实造成的：天堂之火，或从主所流入的聪明和智慧没有被接受。因为这光不断流入，却被邪恶的虚假所弃绝、窒息或扭曲；对真理的无知只能接收一点点；而外在人的感官事物则通过将它变得一般或平凡而使它成为一种暗淡的光。</p>

Each his dream in one night. That this signifies concerning the event which to them was in obscurity, is evident from the signification of a "dream," as being foresight, and hence prediction, and because 
it signifies prediction, it also signifies the event, for prediction is concerning the event; and from the signification of "night," as being obscurity. "Night" in the spiritual sense signifies a 
state of shade brought on by falsity from evil (n. 1712, 2353), thus also obscurity, namely, of the mind. The obscurity of night in the world is natural obscurity; but the obscurity of night in the other 
life is spiritual obscurity. The former arises from the absence of the sun of this world and the deprivation of light therefrom, but the latter from the absence of the sun of heaven which is the 
Lord, and the deprivation of light (that is, of intelligence) therefrom. This deprivation does not arise from the sun of heaven setting, like the sun of the world, but from a man or spirit being in falsity 
from evil, and removing himself, and thus bringing obscurity upon himself. From the mere idea of night and its obscurity in both senses, it is evident how the spiritual sense stands relatively to 
the natural sense of this same thing. Moreover, spiritual obscurity is threefold, one kind being from the falsity of evil, the second from ignorance of truth, and the third is that of exterior things 
relatively to interior things, thus of the sensuous things of the external man relatively to the rational things of the internal man. All these kinds of obscurity however, arise from the fact that the 
light of heaven (or intelligence and wisdom from the Lord) is not received; for this light is continually flowing in, but it is rejected, suffocated, or perverted by the falsity of evil; is but little 
received by ignorance of truth; and is dulled by being made general by the sensuous things of the external man. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5092</b></p><p><b>5092.</b>
'Each his dream in one night' means regarding what the outcome would be, which to them lay in obscurity. This is clear from the meaning of 'a dream' as foresight and consequent foretelling - and because 
a foretelling is meant, so also is the outcome, it being the outcome that is foretold; and from the meaning of 'night' as obscurity. In the spiritual sense 'night' means a state of shade brought about 
through falsity that is the product of evil, <a href="1712.htm">1712</a>, <a href="2353.htm">2353</a>, and so also obscurity, that is to say, mental obscurity. The obscurity belonging to night in the world is natural obscurity, but the obscurity 
belonging to night in the next life is spiritual obscurity. Natural obscurity comes about because the sun of the world is absent and the light received from it is lost, whereas spiritual obscurity 
comes about because heaven's sun, which is the Lord, is absent and the light, that is, intelligence received from it, is lost. This latter loss does not arise because the sun of heaven sets as the sun 
of the world does, but because a person or a spirit is living amid falsity that is the product of evil. He himself moves away from that sun and brings obscurity to himself. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 An idea simply of 
night and of the obscurity that comes with it is sufficient to enable one to see how the spiritual sense and the natural sense of something are related to each other. Furthermore there are three kinds 
of spiritual obscurity - the first being that which is due to falsity that is a product of evil; the second being that which is due to ignorance of the truth; and the third being the obscurity in which 
exterior things dwell, compared with interior ones, and so the obscurity in which ideas formed by the senses and present in the external man dwell, compared with the rational concepts present in the 
internal man. All three kinds of obscurity arise however because the light of heaven, or intelligence and wisdom flowing from the Lord, is not received. This light shines unceasingly, but falsity that 
is a product of evil either rejects, smothers, or else perverts it; ignorance of truth receives only a little; while ideas formed by the senses that are present in the external man reduce it to a 
dim light by making it a general or ordinary one. </p>

'Quisque somnium suum in nocte una': quod significet de eventu qui illis in obscuro, constat ex significatione `somnii' quod sit praevidentia et inde praedictio, et quia est praedictio, etiam est 
eventus, nam de illo est praedictio; et ex significatione `noctis' quod sit obscurum; `nox' in spirituali sensu significat statum umbrae inductum per falsum ex malo, n. 1712, 2353, ita quoque obscurum, 
nempe mentis. Obscurum quod est noctis in mundo, est obscurum naturale, sed obscurum quod est noctis in altera vita, est obscurum spirituale; illud existit ex absentia solis mundi et privatione 
lucis inde, hoc autem ex absentia solis caeli qui est Dominus, et privatione lucis, hoc est, intelligentiae inde; haec privatio non existit per quod sol caeli sicut sol mundi occidat, sed quia homo 
aut {1} spiritus in falso ex malo est, et ipse se removet et {2} sibi obscurum inducit. Ex solum noctis et inde 2 obscuri idea in utroque sensu, patere potest quomodo se habet sensus spiritualis 
respective ad ejusdem rei sensum naturalem. Praeterea obscurum spirituale est triplex; unum quod est ex falso mali, alterum quod est ex ignorantia veri, tertium quod est exteriorum respective ad interiora, 
ita sensualium quae sunt externi hominis, respective ad rationalia quae sunt interni; omnia haec genera usque existunt ex eo quod lux caeli, seu intelligentia et sapientia quae a Domino, 
non recipiatur; haec cum continue influit, sed a falso mali vel rejicitur, vel suffocatur vel pervertitur, ab ignorantia veri parum recipitur, et a sensualibus quae sunt externi hominis, hebescit quia 
fit communis. @1 i quoque$ @2 i inde$ </p>
