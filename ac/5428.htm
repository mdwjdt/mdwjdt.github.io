<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5428节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5428.</strong>“他们却不认得他”表源于神性的这真理在尚未被天堂之光光照的属世之光中是看不见的。这从此前发生的事清楚可知，由于“约瑟认得他哥哥们”表示属灵层的属天层凭它的光看见教会的总体真理，故可知，“他们却不认得他”表属灵层的属天层，也就是源于神性的真理没有被教会的总体真理看见，而这些总体真理处于尚未被天堂之光光照的属世之光。这层含义的确能从刚才的阐述看出来，但由于它属于奥秘，故让我们举例说明这个问题。以天堂的荣耀为例。那些出于因没有一个居间物，尤因没有一致性而未被天堂之光光照的属世之光来思想天堂荣耀的人，对它的观念与对世间荣耀的观念没什么两样。如当他们读到先知所作的启示，尤其约翰在启示录中所作的启示，即一切事物都是最辉煌的时的情形。如果他们被告知，天堂的荣耀远远超越尘世的一切辉煌，以致后者几乎无法与这荣耀相提并论；然而，这还不是真正的天堂的荣耀；天堂的荣耀在于从出现在那里的一切事物闪耀出来的神性，在于对神性事物的觉知和随之而来的智慧；但唯有天堂里的人才拥有这荣耀，因为与智慧相比，他们觉得那里的辉煌根本什么都不是，并将一切智慧都归于主，无一归于自己。然而，如果出于缺乏一个居间物，尤其缺乏一致性的属世之光看待天堂的荣耀，这荣耀根本不被承认。<br />我们再以天使的大能为例。那些出于因没有一个居间物，尤因没有一致性而未被天堂之光光照的属世之光思想天使的大能，尤其思想圣言中所提到的天使长的大能之人，对这种大能的观念与对世间强大统治者的大能的观念没什么两样，即：他们有成千上万个可以统治的下级，天堂的尊贵、显赫就在于这种统治。如果他们被告知，天使的大能的确超越世间强大统治者的一切大能，并且如此之大，以致就连一位等次较低的天使也能驱赶数百万地狱灵，把他们送入自己的地狱；这就是在圣言中，他们被称为“大能”和“掌权”的原因；然而，他们当中最小的就是最大的；也就是说，相信、意愿并发觉一切能力皆源于主，无一源于自己的人是最有大能的；因此，那些在天堂有大能的人完全憎恶一切源于自己的能力。但当凭没有一个居间物，尤其没有一致性的属世之光来看待时，这一点也不被承认。<br />另举一例。出于缺乏一个将其与属灵观念联结起来的居间物，尤其二者之间不存在一致性的属世观念来看待自由的人，只知道自由在于凭自己思想和意愿，在于行事随心所欲，不受限制。更重要的是，属世人为了能拥有他所意愿和思想的任何东西，渴望成为最富有的；为了能随心所欲地做任何事，渴望成为最有权势的。一旦达到这个目的，他就会以为自己处于自由的巅峰，因而拥有真正的幸福。然而，如果他被告知，被称为天堂自由的真自由根本不是这样；相反，它在于不出于自我意愿任何事，唯独出于主；还在于不出于自我思想任何事，唯独出于天堂；因此，天使若被允许出于自己思想和意愿，就会充满痛苦和悲伤，这一点丝毫得不到承认。从这些例子可在某种程度上看出，“约瑟的哥哥们不认得他”所表示的“源于神性的这真理在尚未被天堂之光光照的属世之光中是看不见的”是什么意思。</p>

But they knew not him. That this signifies that truth from the Divine did not appear in natural light not yet illumined by heavenly light, is evident from what immediately precedes; for as by "Joseph's 
knowing his brethren" is signified that the general truths of the church appeared to the celestial of the spiritual from its light, it follows that by "their not knowing him" is signified that the 
celestial of the spiritual, or truth from the Divine, did not appear to the general truths of the church in natural light not yet illumined by heavenly light. How this matter stands is indeed plain from 
what was said just above; but as it is a mystery it may be illustrated by examples-as for instance by the glory of heaven. They who think about the glory of heaven from natural light unillumined by 
the light of heaven, being without an intermediate, and much more if there is no correspondence, can form no other idea of it than such as they may have of the glory of the world; as when they read the 
prophetic revelations, especially those of John in the Revelation, that all things in heaven are most magnificent. And if they are told that the glory of heaven so far surpasses all the magnificence 
of the world that the latter can scarcely be compared with it, and yet that this is not the glory of heaven, but the glory of heaven is the Divine that shines forth from everything that appears there, 
and is the perception of Divine things, and the consequent wisdom; but that this glory is possessed only by those in heaven who regard the magnificence there as nothing in comparison with wisdom, and 
attribute all wisdom to the Lord and none at all to themselves-when this glory of heaven is viewed by natural light without an intermediate, and much more if there is no correspondence, it is not at 
all acknowledged.  [2] Let us take as another example, angelic power. They who think about angelic power, especially about the power of the archangels mentioned in the Word, from natural light not 
illumined by the light of heaven, because without an intermediate, and much more so if there is no correspondence, cannot form any other idea of it than as of the power of the mighty in the world, namely, 
that they have thousands upon thousands of inferiors over whom they rule, and that eminence in heaven consists in such rule. And if they are told that angelic power indeed surpasses all the power 
of the mighty in the world, and that it is so great that one of the lesser angels can drive away myriads of the infernals and thrust them down into their hells, and that this is the reason why in the 
Word they are called "powers" and also "dominions;" while nevertheless the least of them is the greatest, that is, he is most powerful who believes, wills, and perceives that all power is from the Lord 
and none from himself, and thus they who are powers in heaven are utterly averse to all self-derived power-this too, when viewed by natural light without an intermediate, and much more if there is 
no correspondence, is not acknowledged. [3] Let us take another example. He who looks at freedom from what is natural without an intermediate, and much more if there is no correspondence, cannot know 
otherwise than that freedom consists in thinking and willing from himself, and in being able to act without check as he thinks and wills. Wherefore the natural man, in order that he may have whatever 
he thinks and wills, desires to be the richest; and in order that he may be able to do whatever he thinks and wills, desires to be the most powerful; and he believes that he would then be in the height 
of freedom, and hence in happiness itself. But if he is told that real freedom, which is called heavenly freedom, is not at all like this, but consists in willing nothing from self, but from the Lord, 
and also in thinking nothing from self, but from heaven, and hence that the angels are overwhelmed with sorrow and grief if permitted to think and to will from themselves-this is not acknowledged. 
From these examples it will to some extent be seen how it is that truth from the Divine does not appear in natural light not yet illumined by heavenly light, which is signified by Joseph's brethren "not 
knowing him." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5428</b></p><p><b>5428.</b>
'And they did not recognize him' means that truth from the Divine was not seen in natural light that was not yet brightened with heavenly light. This becomes clear from what has gone immediately before 
this, for since 'Joseph recognized his brothers' means that general truths known to the Church were seen by the celestial of the spiritual by the light this possessed, it follows that 'they did not 
recognize him' means that the celestial of the spiritual, which is truth from the Divine, was not seen by the general truths known to the Church while these were in natural light not yet brightened with 
heavenly light. This meaning may indeed be seen from what has been stated immediately above; but as it belongs among arcana let some examples be used to shed light on the matter. Take as an example 
the glory of heaven. Consider those who, when they think about the glory of heaven, see this in natural light that has not been brightened with heavenly light because no intermediary is present, especially 
if no agreement exists. Such people's idea of the glory of heaven cannot be anything different from the kind of idea they possess about the glory of the world when they read, for instance, about 
the revelations made to prophets, in particular those made to John and described in the Book of Revelation, in which everything is most magnificent. One may tell these people that the glory of heaven 
surpasses all worldly magnificence, so completely that one cannot begin to compare it with that glory. One may also tell them that even this is not really the glory of heaven, but that the glory of 
heaven consists in that which is of God shining out of every individual thing to be seen there, and in a perception of Divine realities and in the wisdom gained from that perception. One may tell these 
people too that this alone is the glory to those who are there, for they consider worldly magnificence, in comparison with such wisdom, to be nothing at all, and they attribute all wisdom to the Lord 
and none whatsoever to themselves. But if people behold the glory of heaven in natural light devoid of an intermediary, and especially if no agreement exists, that glory goes completely unrecognized. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
Take angelic power as another example. Consider those who, when they think about angelic power, in particular that of the archangels who are mentioned in the Word, do so in natural light that 
has not been brightened with heavenly light because no intermediary is present, especially if because no agreement exists. Such people's idea of that power cannot be anything different from the idea 
they have of the power wielded by powerful rulers in the world. That is to say, they think that angels have thousands upon thousands of subordinates over whom they rule, and that high positions in heaven 
involve that kind of domination. One may tell these people that angelic power does indeed surpass all power wielded by powerful rulers in the world and is so great that just one of the subordinate 
angels can drive away millions of hellish spirits and send them down into their own hells, which is why in the Word angels are called 'powers' and 'dominions'. One may also tell those people that the 
least of the angels is the greatest; that is, the one who believes, wishes, and perceives that all power originates entirely within the Lord and never at all within himself is a very highly powerful 
ruler. And therefore those who are 'powers' in heaven utterly detest any power that derives from themselves. But neither is any of this recognized when beheld in natural light devoid of the intermediary, 
and more so if no agreement exists. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Take yet another example. Consider a person who looks at freedom from a natural idea devoid of an intermediary linking it to a spiritual one, and especially 
if no agreement exists between the two. He cannot see freedom as anything else than thinking and willing from what is within himself and being able to carry out without restriction whatever he so 
thinks and wills. More than that, to the end that he can have whatever he thinks and wills the natural man wishes to become very rich; and to the end that he can carry out whatever he thinks and wills 
he wishes to become very powerful. Once he has attained this he imagines that he is in perfect freedom and consequently possesses real happiness. If however one tells people like this that true freedom, 
called heavenly freedom, is not at all like that, but that it involves no willing from what is within oneself, only from the Lord, and does not involve any thinking from what is within oneself, only 
from heaven, and that feelings of pain and sorrow ensue if one is allowed to think from what is within oneself and to will from what is in oneself, nothing of this is recognized. </p>
<p>These examples 
may serve to some extent to show what is implied by truth from the Divine not being seen in natural light that has not yet been brightened with heavenly light, meant by Joseph's brothers not recognizing him. </p>

`Et illi non agnoverunt eum': quod significet quod verum a Divino non appareret in luce naturali nondum a luce caelesti illuminata, constare potest ex illis quae mox praecedunt, cum enim per `agnovit 
Joseph fratres suos' significatur quod communia vera Ecclesiae caelesti spiritualis ex luce ejus apparerent, sequitur quod per `illi non agnoverunt eum' significetur quod caeleste spiritualis, seu verum 
a Divino, non appareret veris communibus Ecclesiae in luce naturali nondum a luce caelesti illuminata. Quomodo hoc se habet, ab illis quae mox supra dicta sunt, quidem patet, sed quia est inter arcana, 
licet illustrare id per exempla; sit gloria caeli pro exemplo: qui e luce naturali non a luce caeli illuminata, quia absque medio, et magis si non correspondentia, cogitant de gloria caeli, non 
aliam ideam de illa quam qualem de gloria mundi habere possunt, sicut, dum revelationes propheticae imprimis Johannis in Apocalypsi legunt, quod ibi magnificentissima sint omnia; at cum eis dicitur quod 
gloria caeli excedat omnem magnificentiam mundi, adeo ut haec illi vix comparari queat, et quod tamen hoc non sit gloria caeli, sed quod gloria caeli sit Divinum quod elucet e singulis quae apparent 
ibi, ac Divinorum perceptio, et inde sapientia; {1}sed haec gloria est solum illis ibi qui magnificentiam illam respective ad sapientiam nihili faciunt, et omnem sapientiam Domino et {2}sibi prorsus 
nullam tribuunt: haec gloria caeli cum spectatur a luce naturali absque medio, et magis si non correspondentia, nullatenus agnoscitur. [2]Sit quoque pro exemplo potentia angelica: qui e luce naturali 
a luce caeli non illuminata quia absque medio, et magis si non correspondentia, cogitant de potentia angelica, cumprimis de {3}archangelorum quorum mentio fit in Verbo, non aliam ideam de ea habere 
possunt quam sicut de potentia potentium in mundo, quod nempe millenos et millenos habeant se minores quibus imperent, et quod eminentiae in caelo in tali imperio consistant; at cum illis dicitur quod 
quidem potentia angelica excedat omnem potentiam potentium in mundo, et quod {4}tanta sit ut unus inter minores angelos myriades infernalium abigere, ac in inferna sua detrudere queat, et quod inde quoque 
in Verbo potentiae, ut et dominatus, dicantur, sed usque minimus eorum (t)maximus est, hoc est, {5}qui omne potentiae a Domino et nihil ex se credit, vult et percipit, is maxime potens est; quapropter 
qui potentiae ibi sunt, omnem potentiam ex se plane aversantur; hoc quoque cum spectatur a luce naturali absque medio, et magis si non correspondentia, nec agnoscitur.  [3]Sit adhuc pro exemplo: 
qui e naturali absque medio, et magis si non correspondentia, spectat liberum, non aliter scire potest quam quod liberum sit cogitare et velle ex se, et posse agere absque fraeno sicut cogitat et vult; 
quare etiam naturalis homo, ut habere possit omnia quae cogitat et vult, opulentissimus vult esse, utque agere possit omnia quae cogitat et vult, potentissimus vult esse, et tunc credit ille se in 
summo libero esse, (c)et inde in ipso felici; si autem illis {6}dicitur quod ipsum liberum, quod liberum caeleste vocatur, prorsus non tale sit,sed quod sit nihil velle ex se sed a Domino, immo nec cogitare 
ex se sed (c)a caelo, et inde quod prorsus in maerore sint et in dolore, si illis ex se cogitare et ex se velle permittitur, hoc non agnoscitur. Ex his aliquatenus patere potest quomodo se habet 
cum hoc quod verum a Divino non appareat in luce naturali nondum a luce caelesti illuminata, quae significantur per `quod fratres Josephi non agnoverint eum'. @1 et (x)quod omnia illis (? illa) sint 
iis$  @2 nullam sibi$  @3 archangelis$  @4 talis$  @5 qui minime ex se posse credit et percipit et vult, et maxime potens sit, et quod ex potentia sit, quae vocatur potentia angelica, hi enim omnem 
potentiam ex se, prorsus nihil faciunt ac aversantur, et quantum hoc faciunt, ac unice pro fine habent usum, hunc desiderant, et de hoc gaudent, tantum in potentia angelica sunt, et vice versa, quantum 
pro fine habent ipsam potentiam, ita se et dignitatem, tantum in nulla potentia sunt;$  @6 dicetur$ </p>
