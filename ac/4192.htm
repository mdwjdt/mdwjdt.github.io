<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4192节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4192.</strong>“你们堆聚石头。他们就拿石头来堆成一堆”表由良善所产生的真理。这从“石头”和“堆”的含义清楚可知：“石头”是指真理，如刚才所述（<a href="4190.htm">4190</a>节）；“堆”是指良善。“堆”之所以表示良善，是因为在古时，他们在筑坛之前，先堆成堆，在上面一起吃，作为他们在爱里面联结的证据。可后来，当古人的代表被视为神圣时，他们不再堆成堆，而是筑坛；这坛也是用石头垒的，只是排列得更加整齐而已（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书22.28.htm">22:28</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/书22.34.htm">34</a>）。这就是为何“堆”和“坛”意思一样的原因，即都表示爱之良善；而它的“石头”则表示信之真理。</p>

Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap. That this signifies truths from good, is evident from the signification of "stones," as being truths (concerning which just above, n. 4190); and 
from the signification of a "heap," as being good. That a "heap" signifies good, is because in old time, before they built altars, they made heaps, and ate together upon them, for a witness that they 
were joined together by love. But afterwards, when the representatives of the ancients were regarded as holy, instead of heaps they built alters; which also were of stones, but arranged in a more orderly 
manner (Josh. 22:28, 34). This is the reason why a "heap" has the same signification as an "altar," namely, the good of love; and by the "stones" in it are signified the truths of faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4192</b></p><p><b>4192.</b>
'Gather stones; and they took stones and made a heap' means truths arising out of good. This is clear from the meaning of 'stones' as truths, dealt with just above in <a href="4190.htm">4190</a>, and from the meaning of 'a 
heap' as good. The reason why 'a heap' means good is that in former times before they used to construct altars people made heaps and ate on them as a witness to their being joined together in love. But 
later on, when the representatives of the ancients were regarded as being holy, instead of heaps they built altars, which also consisted of stones but arranged more methodically, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%2022:28,%2034&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 22:28, 34</a>. This 
is why 'a heap' has a similar meaning to an altar, namely the good of love, the stones of it meaning the truths of faith. </p>

</p><b>4192.</b>
`Colligite lapides; et acceperunt lapides, et fecerunt acervum': quod significet vera ex bono, constat ex significatione `lapidum' quod sint vera, de qua mox supra n. 4190; et ex significatione `acervi' 
quod sit bonum; quod `acervus' significet bonum, est inde quia olim antequam struebant altaria, fecerunt acervos, et super illis comederunt, in testem quod conjungerentur amore; sed postea 
cum repraesentativa antiquorum sancta haberentur, pro acervis aedificabant altaria, et quoque ex lapidibus sed ordinatius dispositis {1}, Jos. xxii 28, 34; inde simile significatur per `acervum' quod 
per altare, nempe bonum amoris, et per `lapides' ibi vera fidei.      @1 positis$ </p>
