<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6275节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6275.</strong>“他就给约瑟祝福”表关于理解力的真理和意愿的良善的预言，这二者都从内在拥有生命。这从“祝福”的含义，以及玛拿西和以法莲的代表清楚可知：“祝福”是指预言（参看<a href="6230.htm">6230</a>，<a href="6254.htm">6254</a>节）；此处使用“约瑟”之名的玛拿西和以法莲是指属世层里面理解力的真理和意愿的良善，这二者都是从内在所生的（<a href="6234.htm">6234</a>，<a href="6249.htm">6249</a>节）。“约瑟”表示他的两个儿子，这一事实从祝福本身明显看出来，经上说：“救赎我脱离一切邪恶的那使者，赐福与这两个童子。愿他们称为我名下”。他们之所以被称为“约瑟”，是因为由“玛拿西和以法莲”所代表的属世层里面的这良善与真理作为内在本身存在于那里。<br />诚然，内在和外在彼此不同，互相分离；但内在住在它们这二者一起所存在的属世层里面，如同住在适合它的自己的一个形式里面。该形式凭自己什么也做不了，而是在它里面的内在指导之下行动；因此，它只是被作用。此中情形就像一个结果里面的有效原因：有效原因和结果彼此不同，且相互分离；然而，有效原因住在结果里面，如同住在自己完全适合的形式里面，它通过该形式在产生结果所在的领域中起到原因的作用。在人里面，类似情形也发生在属世层中的良善与真理上，这二者都从内在所生。内在用诸如属于属世层的那类事物包裹自己，以便它能住在那里，并在那里过自己的生活。但它用来包裹自己的事物无非是覆盖物，这些覆盖物凭自己什么也做不了。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6275</b></p><p><b>6275.</b>
And he blessed Joseph. That this signifies a prediction with respect to the truth of the intellectual and the good of the will having life from the internal, is evident from the signification of "blessing," 
as being prediction (see n. 6230, 6254); and from the representation of Ephraim and Manasseh, who here are "Joseph," as being the truth of the intellectual and the good of the will in the natural, 
born from the internal (n. 6234, 6249). That by "Joseph" are meant his sons, is evident from the blessing itself, in which it is said, "The Angel who redeemeth me from all evil, bless the boys, and 
let my name be called in them;" and the reason is that this good and truth in the natural, represented by Manasseh and Ephraim, are the very internal there. The internal and the external are indeed 
distinct from each other; but in the natural, where they are together, the internal is as in its own adapted form, which form does nothing from itself, but only from the internal within it; thus it is 
merely acted upon. The case herein is like the efficient in the effect: the efficient and the effect are distinct from each other, yet the efficient is in the effect as in its own adapted form, and 
through it acts as cause in the sphere where the effect is produced. In man the like is the case with the good and truth in the natural, born from the internal; for the internal clothes itself with such 
things as belong to the natural, in order that it may be there and lead a life there; but the things with which it clothes itself are nothing but coverings, which of themselves do nothing at all. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6275</b></p><p><b>6275.</b>
'And he blessed Joseph' means a foretelling about the truth belonging to the understanding and the good belonging to the will, both of which possess life from the internal. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'blessing' as a foretelling, dealt with in <a href="6230.htm">6230</a>, <a href="6254.htm">6254</a>; and from the representation of Ephraim and Manasseh, to whom the name 'Joseph' applies here, as truth belonging to the understanding and 
good belonging to the will within the natural, which are born from the internal, dealt with in <a href="6234.htm">6234</a>, <a href="6249.htm">6249</a>. The fact that the name 'Joseph' is used to mean his sons is evident from the actual blessing, 
which declares,  </p>
<p>The angel redeeming me from every evil, may he bless the boys, and in them will my name be called. </p>
<p>And the reason why they are called 'Joseph' is that the goodness and truth within 
the natural, which are represented by 'Manasseh and Ephraim', exist there as the internal itself. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Internal and external are, it is true, distinct and separate from each other; but within the 
natural, where they are both together, the internal resides as if within a form of its own, perfectly suited to it. That form does not at all act independently but under the direction of the internal 
within it, and so is merely an agent. It is like the efficient cause within an effect. The efficient cause and the effect are distinct and separate from each other; yet the efficient cause resides 
within the effect as if the effect were its own form, perfectly suited to it, and through that form it acts as the cause in the sphere where the effect is produced. Something similar to this goes on with 
goodness and truth in a person's natural, which are born from the internal. The internal clothes itself with such things as belong to the natural, so that it can reside there and lead its life there. 
But the things with which it clothes itself are nothing else than coverings, which do not act independently. </p>

</p><b>6275.</b>
`Et benedixit Josepho':  quod significet praedictionem de vero intellectualis et bono voluntarii vitam habentibus ex interno, constat ex significatione `benedicere' quod sit praedictio, de qua n. 6230, 
6254; et ex repraesentatione `Ephraimi et Menashis' qui hic sunt Josephus, quod sint verum intellectualis et bonum voluntarii in naturali nata ab interno, de qua n. 6234, (x)6249; quod per `Josephum' 
{1} intelligantur filii ejus, patet ab ipsa benedictione, in qua dicitur `angelus redimens me ab omni malo benedicat pueris, et vocabitur in illis nomen meum'; et est causa quia bonum illud et verum 
in naturali, quae repraesentantur per `Menashen et Ephraimum', sunt ipsum internum ibi; [2] internum et externum {2}sunt quidem inter se distincta, sed in naturali ubi simul sunt, est internum ut in 
sua forma sibi adaequata, quae forma nihil {3}ex se, sed ex interno quod inibi, agit, ita modo agitur; se habet hoc sicut efficiens in effectu; efficiens et effectus sunt inter se distincti, sed usque 
est efficiens in effectu ut in sua forma sibi adaequata, et per illam agit causam in sphaera ubi {4}sistitur effectus.  Similiter se habet cum bono et vero in naturali apud hominem, quae nata sunt 
ab interno; internum enim {5} induit se talibus quae naturalis sunt, ut possit ibi esse, et ibi {6} vitam agere; sed illa quibus se induit, non sunt aliud quam integumenta quae a se prorsus nihil agunt. @1 
i hic$ @2 before Internum$ @3 agit ex se, sed est Internum quod ibi agit, et quidem per formam$ @4 est$ @5 i modo$ @6 i convenienter$ </p>
