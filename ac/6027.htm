<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6027节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6027.</strong>“雅各打发犹大在他之前到约瑟那里”表教会的良善与内在属天层的交流。这从“犹大”和“约瑟”的代表清楚可知：“犹大”是指教会的良善（参看<a href="5583.htm">5583</a>，<a href="5603.htm">5603</a>，<a href="5782.htm">5782</a>，<a href="5794.htm">5794</a>，<a href="5833.htm">5833</a>节）；“约瑟”是指内在属天层（<a href="5869.htm">5869</a>，<a href="5877.htm">5877</a>节）。“打发（犹大）在他之前”表示交流，这是显而易见的。之所以打发犹大，而非其他人，是为了可以表示良善与良善的直接交流；也就是“犹大”所代表的外在良善与“约瑟”所代表的内在良善的直接交流。因为良善，即对主之爱和对邻之仁的良善，从主经由内在流入外在；并且外在中的良善的量决定了那里接受多少。但是，如果人的外在里面只有信之真理，没有良善，那么从主经由内在而来的良善之流注就无法在外在里面被接受。因为与真理的直接交流不可能存在于那里，只有经由良善的间接交流存在。这就是为什么雅各打发犹大，而非其他人到约瑟那里去的原因。</p>

And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph. That this signifies the communication of the good of the church with the internal celestial, is evident from the representation of Judah, as being the good of 
the church (see n. 5583, 5603, 5782, 5794, 5833); and from the representation of Joseph, as being the internal celestial (n. 5869, 5877); that "to send before him" denotes to communicate, is plain. 
The reason why Judah was sent, and not another, was that there might be signified the communication of good with good, which is immediate; namely, the communication of external good, which Judah represents, 
with internal good, which Joseph represents. For the good which is of love to the Lord and of charity toward the neighbor flows in from the Lord through the internal into the external; and so much 
is received in the external as there is of good there. But if in the man's external there is only the truth of faith, and not good, then the influx of good from the Lord through the internal is not 
received in the external; for immediate communication with truth is not possible, but only mediate communication through good. This is the reason why no other than Judah was sent by Jacob unto Joseph. </p>

'And he sent Judah before him to Joseph' means a communication of the good of the Church with the internal celestial. This is clear from the representation of 'Judah' as the good of the Church, dealt 
with in <a href="5583.htm">5583</a>, <a href="5603.htm">5603</a>, <a href="5782.htm">5782</a>, <a href="5794.htm">5794</a>, <a href="5837.htm">5837</a>; and from the representation of' Joseph' as the internal celestial, dealt with in <a href="5869.htm">5869</a>, <a href="5877.htm">5877</a>. And 'sending before him', it is self-evident, means communicating. The 
reason why Judah and not anyone else was sent was so that a direct communication of good with good might be denoted, that is, a direct communication of external good, which 'Judah' represents, with 
internal good, which 'Joseph' represents. For good that is the good of love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour flows in from Him by way of the internal into the external, the amount of good 
in the external determining how much is received there. But if merely the truth of faith and no good is present in a person's external, the inflow of good from the Lord by way of the internal cannot 
be received in the external. For no direct communication with truth can exist there, only an indirect one through good. This is why Judah and not anyone else was sent from Jacob to Joseph. </p>

`Et Jehudam misit ante se ad Josephum':  quod significet communicationem boni Ecclesiae cum caelesti interno, constat ex repraesentatione `Jehudae' quod {1} sit bonum Ecclesiae, de qua n. 5583, 5603, 
5782, 5794, 5833; et a repraesentatione `Josephi' quod sit caeleste internum, de qua n. 5869, 5877; quod `mittere ante se' sit communicare, patet.  Quod Jehudah missus fuerit et non alius, erat ut significaretur 
communicatio quae immediata est boni cum bono, nempe boni externi quod `Jehudah' repraesentat, cum bono interno quod `Joseph'; influit enim (t)a Domino bonum, quod est amoris in Ipsum et 
charitatis erga proximum, per internum in externum, et quantum boni est in externo tantum ibi recipitur; {2}si autem in externo hominis modo verum fidei est, non autem bonum, tunc influxus boni (t)a 
Domino per internum non recipitur in externo, nam communicatio cum vero immediata non datur sed mediata per bonum; haec causa est quod non alius a Jacobo ad Josephum missus sit quam Jehudah. @1 i hic$ @2 
si modo verum quod fidei, in externo homine est$ </p>
