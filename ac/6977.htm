<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6977节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6977.</strong>“你从河里取的水”表状态的颠倒。这从接下来的经文明显看出来，因为经上说它们“必在旱地上变作血”，以此表示对所有真理的歪曲和它在属世层中的匮乏。当这种情况发生时，状态就完全颠倒了。因此，由于这句话暗示一种状态的颠倒，所以也可以说这句话表示这样一种颠倒。当属世层完全被虚假占据时，一种状态的完全颠倒也发生在属世层中。当人活在世上时，这种情况很少发生在他身上；但在来世，凡被投入地狱的，都会发生这种情况。当人活在世上时，这种情况之所以很少发生在他身上，是因为那时，他不断被保持在能被改造的状态中，只要他在自由中停止邪恶。但死后，他所过的生活会跟随他，他就留在他在世上通过一生所获得的状态中。<br />到那时，沉浸于邪恶的人就再也不能被改造了；一切真理与良善都从他那里被夺走，以免他与天上的任何社群来往。因此，他留在邪恶与虚假中；这些邪恶与虚假照着他在世上所获得的接受它们的能力而增长。尽管如此，他不允许越过他所获得的极限。这就是此处所表示的状态的颠倒，这种颠倒具有这样的性质：人再无法经历内在的矫正了，只能经历外在的矫正，也就是说，通过对惩罚的恐惧得到外在的矫正。在经历了多次痛苦之后，他最终放弃邪恶，但不是在自由中放弃的，而是被迫放弃的，作恶的欲望仍旧存留。如前所述，这种欲望是通过恐惧被控制住的，这些恐惧是矫正的外在和强迫手段。这就是恶人在来世的状态。</p>

And the waters which thou hast taken out of the river. That this signifies inversion of state, is evident from what presently follows, for it is said that "they shall become blood in the dry [land]," 
whereby is signified the falsification of all truth, and the privation of it in the natural. When this takes place the state is completely inverted; and hence these words, as they involve an inversion 
of state, are also said to signify it. There is also a total inversion of state in the natural when it is entirely occupied by falsities. This rarely happens with man while he lives in the world, but 
in the other life it takes place with all who are cast into hell. That it rarely happens with man while he lives in the world is because he is then continually kept in a state capable of being reformed, 
provided that he desists from evils in freedom. But after death his life follows him, and he remains in the state which he had acquired by the whole course of his life in the world. [2] Then he 
who is in evil is no longer capable of being reformed; and lest he should have communication with any society of heaven, all truth and good are taken away from him; so that he remains in evil and falsity, 
which grow there in accordance with the capacity to receive them that he has acquired in the world. Nevertheless he is not allowed to pass beyond the acquired bounds. This inversion of state is what 
is here meant, which is such that he can no longer be amended as to the interiors, but only as to the exteriors, namely, by fear of punishments. After enduring these many times, he at last abstains 
from evil, not in freedom, but by compulsion, the cupidity of doing evil still remaining. This cupidity, as before said, is kept in check by fears, which are external and compulsory means of amendment. 
This is the state of the evil in the other life. </p>

'And it will be water which you have taken' means an inversion of state. This is clear from the words that come immediately after these, for it says that the water will become blood on the dry land, 
meaning the falsification of all truth and the deprivation of it in the natural. When this happens a complete inversion of state takes place. Thus it is that because those words imply an inversion of 
state they are also said to mean such an inversion. A total inversion of state has also taken place in the natural when nothing but falsities are in possession of it. This rarely happens with a person 
while he is living in the world; but in the next life it is what happens with all who are cast into hell. The reason why it rarely happens with a person while he is living in the world is that during 
that time he is preserved constantly in a condition that enables him to be reformed, provided that in freedom he refrains from behaving in evil ways. But after death the life he has led follows him, 
and he remains in the condition he has acquired through the whole course of his life in the world. Then one who is immersed in evil is no longer able to be reformed; and for fear that he should come into 
contact with any community in heaven, everything true or good is taken away from him. As a result he remains immersed in evil and falsity, and these - the evil and falsity - increase in him according 
to the ability he has acquired in the world to receive them. Even so, he is not allowed to go beyond his acquired limits. This is what an inversion of state is used to mean here. The nature of it 
is such that a person can no longer undergo inward, only outward correction, that is to say, through fear on account of punishments. And when he has suffered these often, he finally refrains from evil, 
not in freedom but through compulsion, though the desire to do evil remains. This desire is held in check by means of fears which, as has been stated, are outward means of correction and provide compulsion. 
This is the condition of the evil in the next life. </p>

`Et erunt aquae quas accepisti': quod significet inversionem status, constat ab illis quae mox sequuntur, nam dicitur quod `erunt in sanguinem in arida,' per quod significatur falsificatio omnis veri 
et privatio ejus in naturali; cum hoc fit, status prorsus invertitur; inde est quod illa verba, quia involvunt, etiam significare dicuntur inversionem status.  Est etiam totalis inversio status in naturali 
cum id nihil nisi quam falsa occupant; hoc raro fit apud hominem cum vivit in mundo, sed in altera vita {1}cum omnibus qui conjiciuntur in infernum; quod fiat raro cum homine cum vivit in mundo, 
est quia tunc continue tenetur in statu ut reformari queat, modo ex libero desistat a malis; at post mortem sequitur illum vita ejus, et manet in statu {2}quem sibi comparavit per totum' vitae suae 
cursum in mundo; tunc qui in malo est non amplius reformari potest; et ne communicationem habeat cum aliqua societate caeli, adimitur ei omne verum et bonum, unde {3}manet in malo et falso, quae, nempe 
malum et falsum, accrescunt ibi secundum facultatem quam sibi acquisivit in mundo, recipiendi illa, {4} sed usque non ultra terminos acquisitos {5} licet ei transcendere; haec (t)inversio status est 
quae hic intelligitur; quae talis est {6}ut non amplius emendari queat quoad interiora sed modo quoad exteriora, nempe per timores propter poenas, quas cum saepe sustinuit, {7} abstinet {8}tandem, non 
ex libero sed ex coacto, manente usque cupiditate faciendi malum; quae cupiditas in freno tenetur per timores, ut dictum, qui sunt media emendationis externa, et cogunt; hic status est malorum in altera 
vita. 	@1 fit cum omni qui conjicitur$ 	@2 in quo fuit cum absolvit$ 	@3 remanet in naturali modo malum et falsum$ 	@4 i inde multo pejor fit, quam fuerat in vita corporis,$ 	@5 i non$ 	@6
