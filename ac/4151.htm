<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4151节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4151.</strong>“原来雅各不知道拉结偷了它们”表它们属于对内层真理的情感。这从“拉结”的代表，以及“偷”的含义清楚可知：“拉结”是指对内层真理的情感（参看<a href="3758.htm">3758</a>，<a href="3782.htm">3782</a>，<a href="3793.htm">3793</a>，<a href="3819.htm">3819</a>节）；“偷”是指夺走被珍视和神圣之物（参看<a href="4112.htm">4112</a>，<a href="4113.htm">4113</a>，<a href="4133.htm">4133</a>节）。拉结偷了家中的神像，或拉班的神明表示就真理而言，“拉班”所代表的状态改变（参看<a href="4111.htm">4111</a>节）；此处和下文会进一步描述状态的这种改变；因为当“拉班”所代表的良善与“雅各”所表示的良善分离，因而通过这种分离进入另一种状态时，这种改变就会发生。因为当这两种良善结合在一起时，这些真理在他看来就是他自己的，而如今却感觉它们好像被夺走了一样。这就是为何拉班因家中神像而抱怨，又为何搜查帐棚，却没有搜到的原因。因为由正面意义上的“家中神像”所表示的真理（<a href="4111.htm">4111</a>节）并不是他的，而是属于“拉结”所表示的对真理的情感。<br />此中情形若不通过来世所发生的事，就无法看明白。因为在今世之人身边发生在来世的事在他看来就好像发生在他里面；这种情形在来世的灵人身上几乎是一样的。当处于居间或中间良善的灵人社群与天使在一起时，他们就觉得属于天使的真理与良善仿佛是他们的；事实上，他们也没有别的意识。但当他们分离时，他们就感觉这不是事实；于是，就怨声载道，以为这些良善与真理被与他们同在的天使从他们那里被夺走了。这就是本节和接下来的几节关于家中神像所讲述的事在内义上所表示的。<br />一般来说，情况是这样：没有哪个人拥有的良善或真理是他自己的，一切良善与真理皆从主流入，既直接流入，也间接经由天使社群流入。然而，表面上看，那良善或真理似乎是人的，这是为了叫它们能转让给人，成为他自己的，直到他进入这样一种状态：他能知道，然后承认，最终相信它们不是他的，而是主的。从圣言并在基督教界众所周知的是，一切良善和一切真理都源自主，根本没有任何良善来自人。事实上，取自圣言的教会教义宣称人凭自己甚至不能争取良善，因而不能意愿它，结果不能行出它，因为行善源于意愿善。它们还宣称，信的全部皆从主而得；以致若非它从主流入，人根本不可能拥有一丝信。<br />这些观念都是教会的教义所宣称的，也是布道所教导的。但很少人，甚至罕有人真正相信它们；这一点从以下事实可以看出来：人们以为一切生命天生就存在于他们自己里面，几乎不会想到生命是流入的。人的全部生命就在于思想并意愿的能力，因为如果思想和意愿的能力被拿走，生命就毫无存留了。生命的真正本质就在于思想并意愿良善，还在于思想真理，并意愿我们视之为真理的事。由于根据取自圣言的教义，这些能力不是人的，而是主的，它们从主经由天堂流入，故但凡有点判断力，并能反思的人都能从这一事实得出以下结论：一切生命都是流入的。<br />邪恶与虚假的情形也一样。根据取自圣言的教义，魔鬼不断试图迷惑人，将他引入歧途，并不断激发邪恶，将邪恶注入他里面。因此，当有人犯了大罪时，可以说是他允许魔鬼迷惑他，将他引入歧途。这也是一个真相，尽管很少有人相信。因为正如一切良善与真理皆出自主，一切邪恶与虚假皆出自地狱，也就是出自魔鬼，地狱就是魔鬼。由此也可以看出，正如一切良善与真理都是流入的，一切邪恶与虚假也是流入的，因此对邪恶的一切思维和意愿同样是流入的。由于这些也是流入的，所以但凡有点判断力并能反思的人都能得出这个结论：一切生命都是流入的，尽管表面上看，它似乎天生就在人里面。<br />这一事实被反复证明给刚从尘世进入来世的灵人们。但其中一些灵人却说，既然一切邪恶与虚假也是流入的，那么邪恶或虚假根本不能归因于他们，他们并无过错，因为这类邪恶或虚假出自另外一个源头。不过，他们得到的答复是：他们因相信他们凭自己思想和意愿而已经将那邪恶与虚假变成自己的人。然而，他们若早就相信事情的真相，就不会将那邪恶与虚假变成自己的。因为在这种情况下，他们就会相信一切良善与真理皆出自主；他们若相信这一事实，就会允许自己被主引领，因而他们的状态就会变得完全不同。在这种情况下，进入其思维和意愿的邪恶就不会对他们造成影响了；也就是说，从他们里面出来的不再是邪恶，而是良善；因为照主在马克福音（7:15）中的话说“从外面进入的，不能污秽人；惟有从里面出来的，乃能污秽人”。 <br />许多人知道这一点，但很少有人相信。甚至那些恶人也知道，只是仍旧不相信，因为他们更喜欢自己的想法，并且喜欢到这种地步：当向他们证明一切都是流入的时，他们便陷入焦虑，强烈要求允许他们照自己的想法去生活，声称如果这一切从他们那里被夺走，他们就无法再继续活下去。这就是那些知道之人的信仰。之所以阐述这些事，是为了叫人们知道，那些处于居间或中间良善的灵人社群在与其他结合时是何情形，在与他们分离时又是何情形。也就是说，当与其他人结合时，他们没有意识到良善与真理不是他们自己的；而事实上，它们的确不是他们的。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4151</b></p><p><b>4151.</b>
And Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them. That this signified that they were of the affection of interior truth, is evident from the representation of Rachel, as being the affection of interior 
truth (see n. 3758, 3782, 3793, 3819); and from the signification of "stealing," as being to take away that which is dear and holy (see n. 4112, 4113, 4133). By Rachel stealing the teraphim, or Laban's 
gods, as narrated above, was signified the change of state represented by Laban as to truth (see n. 4111); and here and in what follows, this change of state is further described, as resulting from 
the fact that after the good represented by Laban had been separated from the good which is "Jacob," it came through this separation into another state; for those truths which when the goods had been 
conjoined had appeared to the good represented by Laban as its own, were now perceived as if they had been taken away. This is the reason why Laban made complaint concerning them, and why he searched 
in the tents and did not find anything. For the truths signified by the teraphim in a good sense (n. 4111), were not his, but belonged to the affection of truth which is "Rachel." [2] How the case herein 
is cannot be seen except from what happens in the other life; for the things which there happen near a man appear to him as if they were in him; and the case is nearly the same with the spirits 
in the other life. When societies of spirits which are in mediate good are in company with angels, it then appears to them exactly as if the truths and goods which belong to the angels are theirs, and 
indeed they know no otherwise. But when they are separated, they then perceive that this is not the case; and they therefore complain, as believing them to be taken away by those in whose company they 
have been. This is what is here signified in the internal sense by what is narrated concerning the teraphim.  [3] Speaking generally, the case is that no one ever has good and truth which is his own, 
but all good and truth flow in from the Lord, both immediately, and also mediately through angelic societies; and yet it appears as if the good and truth were the man's, to the intent that they may 
be appropriated to him, until he comes into a state to know, and then to acknowledge, and at last to believe, that they are not his, but the Lord's. Moreover it is known from the Word, and thereby in 
the Christian world, that all good and truth are from the Lord, and that nothing of good is from man; nay, the doctrinals of the church which are from the Word declare that man cannot even strive after 
good of himself, and thus cannot will it, and therefore cannot do it-for doing good is from willing good-and that all faith also is from the Lord; so that a man can have no faith at all unless it flows 
in from the Lord. [4] These things are declared by the doctrinals of the church, and are taught by preachings. But that few, nay, very few, believe it to be so, may be seen from the fact that they 
suppose all life to be in themselves, and scarcely any think that life flows in. All man's life consists in the faculty of being able to think and of being able to will; for if the faculty of thinking 
and willing is taken away, nothing of life remains. And the veriest life consists in thinking good and willing good, and also in thinking truth, and in willing that which we think to be true. As it 
is in accordance with the doctrinals of the church which are from the Word that these things are not of man, but of the Lord, and that they flow in from the Lord through heaven, those who possess any 
judgment and are able to reflect, might conclude therefrom that all life flows in. [5] The same is the case with evil and falsity. According to the doctrinals from the Word, the devil is continually 
endeavoring to seduce man, and is continually inspiring evil; and therefore when anyone commits a great crime; it is said that he has suffered himself to be led astray by the devil. And this is the 
real fact, although few if any believe it; for as all good and truth are from the Lord, so all evil and falsity are from hell, that is, from the devil, for hell is the devil. From this we can also see 
that as all good and truth flow in, so also do all evil and falsity, and consequently also all the thinking and willing of evil. As these also flow in, all who have any judgment and are able to reflect, 
can infer that all life flows in, although it appears as if it were in man.  [6] That this is the case has frequently been shown to spirits who had come recently from the world into the other life. 
But some of them have said that if all evil and falsity also flow in, nothing of evil and falsity can be attributed to them, and they are not in fault, because these come from another source. But they 
received for answer that they had appropriated evil and falsity by believing that they think and will of themselves; whereas if they had believed as the case really is, they would not then have appropriated 
the evil and falsity, for they would have believed all good and truth to be from the Lord; and if they had believed this, they would have suffered themselves to be led by the Lord, and therefore 
would have been in a different state; and then the evil which entered into their thought and will would not have affected them, because not evil but good would have gone out of them; for it is not 
the things that enter in, but those which go out that affect us; according to the Lord's words in Mark 7:15. [7] Many can know this, but few believe it. Even those who are evil can know, but still 
not believe it, for they desire to be in what is their own, and they love this to such a degree that when they are shown that everything flows in, they come into anxiety and urgently entreat that they 
may be permitted to live in what is their own, insisting that if this should be taken away from them, they could live no longer. Such is the belief even of those who know. These things have been said 
in order that it may be known how the case is with societies of spirits which are in mediate good, when they are conjoined with others and when they are separated from them; namely, that when they are 
conjoined, they know no otherwise than that the goods and truths are their own, although they are not theirs. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4151</b></p><p><b>4151.</b>
'And Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them' means that they belonged to the affection for interior truth. This is clear from the representation of 'Rachel' as the affection for interior truth, 
dealt with in <a href="3758.htm">3758</a>, <a href="3782.htm">3782</a>, <a href="3793.htm">3793</a>, <a href="3819.htm">3819</a>, and from the meaning of 'stealing' as taking away that which is cherished and holy, dealt with in <a href="4112.htm">4112</a>, <a href="4113.htm">4113</a>, <a href="4133.htm">4133</a>. It was stated above that Rachel's stealing 
the teraphim or Laban's gods meant a change as regards truth of the state represented by 'Laban', see <a href="4111.htm">4111</a>. That change of state is described further still in this verse and in those immediately following; 
for the change came about when the good represented by 'Laban' had been separated from the good meant by 'Jacob' and so through that separation passed into a different state. For the truths that 
had appeared to him to be his own when the two kinds of good were joined together were regarded in such a way that it seemed as though they had been taken away. This is the reason why Laban complained 
bitterly about the teraphim, and why he searched the tents for them, though he did not find them. For the truths which in the good sense are meant by 'the teraphim', <a href="4111.htm">4111</a>, were not his but belonged 
to the affection for truth meant by 'Rachel'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 These matters cannot be made plain except from things that take place in the next life. For things taking place in the next life near a person in this 
life seem to him to occur within him. And virtually the same is so with spirits in the next life. When communities of spirits which are governed by intermediate good are in association with angels 
it seems to them, altogether so, as though they possessed as their own the truths and goods which are the angels'; indeed those spirits are not aware of them being anything other than their own. But 
when they are separated they then realize that this is not true. They too therefore complain bitterly, believing that those goods and truths have been taken away from them by the angels with whom they 
have been in association. These are the considerations that are meant in the internal sense by 'teraphim' in this verse and those immediately following. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In general the situation is that no one 
ever possesses good or truth that is his own but that all good and truth flow in from the Lord, doing so both immediately and through angelic communities serving as intermediaries. Nevertheless it seems 
as though that good or truth is his own, and the reason for this is that these may be made over to him as his own until the time when he enters that state in which he may know, then acknowledge, and 
at length believe that they are not his but the Lord's. It is also well known from the Word and thereby in the Christian world that all good and all truth are derived from the Lord and nothing good 
at all from man. indeed the teachings of the Church which are drawn from the Word declare that of himself man cannot even strive after good and so cannot will it, and as a consequence cannot do it, since 
the doing of good springs from the willing of it. They also declare that the whole of faith is received from the Lord, so that man cannot have the smallest measure of belief unless it flows in from 
the Lord. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 These ideas are declared in the teachings of the Church and are taught in sermons. But few, indeed very few people, really believe them, as is proven by their presumption that life 
in its entirety exists inherently within themselves, and by the fact that scarcely any believe that life is something inflowing. Man's life in its entirety consists in being able to think and being able 
to will, for if that ability to think and to will is taken away no life remains at all. And the very essence of life consists in his thinking what is good and willing what is good, and also in his 
thinking what is true and willing that which he thinks is true. Since these abilities, according to teachings from the Word, are not man's but the Lord's and they flow in from the Lord by way of heaven, 
people who have any power of judgement and who are capable of reflecting could from this fact deduce that life in its entirety is something which inflows. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 The same applies to evil and falsity. 
According to teachings drawn from the Word the devil is constantly trying to lead man astray and constantly breathing evil into him. This also is why, when anyone has committed a serious crime, it 
is said that he has allowed the devil to lead him astray. This again is the truth and yet few if any believe it. For just as all good and truth come from the Lord, so all evil and falsity come from hell, 
that is, from the devil - hell being the devil. This also shows that just as all good and truth are things that flow in, so too are all evil and falsity, and as a consequence every thought of evil 
or willing of it flows in too. Since these too are things that flow in, those who have any power of judgement and reflection may deduce that life is something which flows in, though it seems to exist 
inherently in man. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 The truth of this has been demonstrated on many occasions to spirits who had recently arrived in the next life from the world. But some of them have said, If all evil or falsity 
too is something that flows in, then no evil or falsity at all can be attributed to them and they are free from blame since such evil or falsity comes from somewhere else. But they were told in 
reply that they had made that evil and falsity their own through their belief that when they had thought or willed anything they had acted independently, by themselves. Yet if that which is truly so had 
been believed by them they would not then have made that evil and falsity their own. For in that case they would have believed also that all good and truth come from the Lord; and if they had believed 
this, they would have allowed themselves to be led by the Lord and so their state would have been different. In that case also the evil which had entered their thought and will would have had no effect 
on them; that is to say, evil would not have come out of them but good, since, according to the Lord's words in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%207:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 7:15</a>, it is not the things going in which affect a person but those coming out 
of him. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 Many are able to know this but few believe it. Even those who are evil can do so, but they still do not believe it since they prefer their own ideas, which they love to such an extent 
that when it is demonstrated to them that everything is such that it flows in they become worried and demand fiercely that they be allowed to live according to their own ideas, saying that if these are 
taken away from them they could not go on living. Such is the belief even of people who do know. These matters have been stated so that people might know what it is like with those communities of spirits 
which are governed by intermediate good, both when they are joined to others and when they are separated from them. That is to say, when joined to others they are not aware of the goods and truths 
being anything other than their own, when in fact they are not theirs. </p>

`Et non scivit Jacob quod Rachel furata illos': quod significet quod affectionis veri interioris essent, constat ex repraesentatione `Rachelis' quod sit affectio veri interioris, de qua n. 3758, 
3782, 3793, 3819; et a significatione `furari' quod sit auferre quod carum et sanctum est, de qua n. 4112, 4113, 4133; </p>
<p>supra per quod `Rachel furata teraphim seu deos Labanis' significata est mutatio 
status per `Laban' repraesentati quoad verum, videatur n. 4111; mutatio illa status hic et in nunc sequentibus ulterius describitur, quae inde fuit quod bonum per `Labanem' repraesentatum postquam 
separatum a bono quod `Jacob,' in alium statum per separationem venit; vera enim quae apparuerunt ei ut sua, {1} quando bona conjuncta fuerunt, {2} appercepta sunt quasi ablata; haec causa est quod 
Laban de illis conquestus, et quod in tentoriis scrutatus {3}, et non invenerit; vera enim quae per `teraphim' in bono sensu significantur, n. 4111, non fuerunt ejus, sed affectionis veri quae 
est Rachel.  [2] Haec quomodo se habent, nec constare potest nisi ex illis quae contingunt in altera vita; quae enim ibi contingunt prope hominem, illa apparent homini sicut in illo; paene similiter 
se habet cum spiritibus in altera vita; societates spirituum quae in bono medio sunt, cum in societate sunt cum angelis, tunc apparet illis prorsus quasi vera et bona quae angelorum sunt, sint sua, 
immo nec aliter sciunt; at cum separantur, tunc appercipiunt quod non ita sit; quapropter etiam conqueruntur, credentes quod ablata ab illis cum quibus in societate fuerunt; haec sunt quae significantur 
in sensu interno hic [et] in mox sequentibus per `teraphim.'  In genere se ita habet quod nusquam alicui sit {4} bonum et verum quod suum est, sed quod omne bonum et verum influat a Domino, 
tam immediate quam mediate per societates angelicas, sed quod usque appareat sicut bonum et verum sit suum; et hoc ex causa ut illa approprientur homini, usque dum in illum statum venit {5} ut sciat, 
dein {6} agnoscat, et tandem {7} credat, quod non ejus sint, sed {8} Domini; notum etiam est ex Verbo et inde in orbe Christiano quod omne bonum et omne verum sit a Domino et quod nihil boni sit 
ab homine; immo doctrinalia (o)Ecclesiae quae ex Verbo, dictant quod homo ne quidem conari possit bonum a se, ita non velle, proinde non facere, nam facere bonum est ex velle bonum, et quoque quod 
omne fidei sit a Domino, sic ut homo ne minimum credere possit nisi hoc influat a Domino; [4] haec dictant {9} doctrinalia Ecclesiae, et haec (t)docent praedicationes; sed quod pauci, immo paucissimi, 
credant quod ita se habeat, constare potest ex eo quod autument omne vitae esse in se, et vix aliqui quod vita influat; omne vitae hominis consistit in facultate quod cogitare (o)possit et quod 
velle possit, si (o)enim facultas cogitandi et volendi aufertur, nihil vitae remanet; et ipsissimum vitae consistit in cogitare bonum et velle bonum, tum in cogitare verum, et velle id quod cogitat 
verum esse; cum haec secundum doctrinalia quae ex Verbo, non hominis sunt sed Domini, et quod influant a Domino per caelum, inde potuissent illi qui aliquo judicio pollent et qui reflectere possunt, concludere 
quod omne vitae influat: [5] similiter se habet cum malo et falso; secundum doctrinalia quae ex Verbo, est quod diabolus continue conetur seducere hominem et quod continue insufflet 
malum; </p>
<p>inde etiam dicitur cum aliquis grande facinus commisit, quod se passus sit seduci a diabolo; hoc quoque verum est, sed usque pauci si ulli credunt; sicut enim omne bonum et verum est a Domino, 
ita est omne malum et falsum ab inferno, hoc est, a diabolo, nam infernum est diabolus; inde etiam constare potest quod sicut omne bonum et verum, ita quoque omne malum et falsum influat, proinde etiam 
cogitare malum et velle malum; cum haec quoque influunt, concludi potest ab illis qui aliquo judicio pollent et reflectere possunt, quod omne vitae influat tametsi apparet sicut in homine sit: 
[6] quod ita sit, multoties ostensum est spiritibus qui recens e mundo in alteram vitam venerunt; sed quidam eorum dixerunt, si etiam omne malum et falsum influat, quod nihil mali et falsi illis attribui 
possit et quod in culpa non sint quia aliunde; sed responsum tulerunt {10}, quod appropriaverint illud sibi per id quod crediderint se ex se cogitare et ex se velle, at si credidissent 
sicut res se habet, quod {11} tunc non illa sibi appropriavissent; nam tunc etiam credidissent quod omne bonum e verum a Domino, et si hoc credidissent, quod se duci passi fuissent Domino et sic 
in alio statu fuissent; et tunc malum quod intravisse in cogitationem et voluntatem, non affecisset illos, quippe non exivisset malum sed exivisset bonum, nam quae intrant non afficiunt, sed quae 
exeunt, secundum Domini verba apud Marcum vii 15.  [7] At scire hoc multi possunt, sed pauci credere; qui mali sunt, etiam hoc scire possunt sed usque non credunt nam in proprio volunt esse, et hoc 
amant usque adeo ut cum illis ostenditur quod influat omne, in anxietatem veniant et summopere flagitent ut in proprio suo liceat eis vivere, et si id illis auferretur, quod non amplius vivere possent; 
ita credunt {12} etiam illi qui sciunt.  Haec dicta sunt ut sciatur quomodo se res habet cum societatibus spirituum quae in bono medio sunt, cum conjunctae sunt aliis et cum ab illis separatae
