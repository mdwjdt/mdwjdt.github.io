<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10229节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10229</strong>.“你要从以色列人当中收这赎罪银”表源于良善的进行洁净的真理，这些真理是教会的。这从“银”和“赎罪”的含义，以及“以色列人”的代表清楚可知：“银”是指源于良善的真理（参看<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="2954.htm">2954</a>，<a href="5658.htm">5658</a>，<a href="6112.htm">6112</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>，<a href="6917.htm">6917</a>，<a href="8932.htm">8932</a>节）；“赎罪”是指从邪恶当中洁净，如前所述（<a href="10218.htm">10218</a>节）；“以色列人”是指教会（参看<a href="9340.htm">9340</a>节提到的地方）。之所以说“进行洁净的真理”，是因为从邪恶当中的一切洁净都是通过真理实现的（<a href="2799.htm">2799</a>，<a href="5954.htm">5954</a>，<a href="7044.htm">7044</a>，<a href="7918.htm">7918</a>，<a href="9089.htm">9089</a>节）。此处的情况是这样：人凭自己只会思想邪恶；因为他凭自己不会思想神，也不会思想对邻舍的良善和正义，除非对他自己有好处。他甚至不思想天堂和永生，只思想世界和世上的生命。只要一个人的心智处于这种状态，他的思维就源于在他下面的事物，而非在他上面的事物，因而源于地狱，而非天堂。因此，一个人若要思想良善，他的思维必须源于天堂，所以他的心智必须朝那个方向被提升。这一切只能通过诸如源于圣言、存在于教会里面的那类真理实现；因为这些真理教导神的性质，邻舍是谁，天堂的存在和永生的真实性，尤其教导何为邪恶、何为良善。当这些真理进入心智时，它的内层就被提升到自我之上，从而被引离那些在自我之下的事物，因而被引离邪恶。由此可见，从邪恶中的一切邪恶或移走都是通过真理实现的，所以这些真理被称为“进行洁净的真理”。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 10229</b></p><p><b>10229.</b>
And thou shalt take the silver of expiations from among the sons of Israel. That this signifies truths purifying by virtue of good, which truths are of the church, is evident from the signification of 
"silver," as being truth from good (see n. 1551, 2954, 5658, 6112, 6914, 6917, 8932); from the signification of "expiations," as being purification from evils (of which above, n. 10218); thus "the silver 
of expiations" denotes purifying truth; and from the representation of the sons of Israel, as being the church (see the places cited in n. 9340). It is said "purifying truth" because all purification 
from evils is effected by means of truths (n. 2799, 5954, 7044, 7918, 9089). The case herein is this. From himself man thinks nothing but evil, for from himself he does not think about God, nor 
about what is good and just toward his neighbor, except for the sake of self. He does not even think about heaven and eternal life, but about the world and life in the world. So long as a man is in such 
a state, he thinks from the things which are beneath him, and not from those which are above him; thus from hell, and not from heaven. In order therefore that a man may think what is good, he must 
think from heaven, consequently his mind must be raised there. This is effected solely by means of truths such as are in the church from the Word; for these truths teach what God is, and what the neighbor, 
that there is a heaven, that there is eternal life, and in particular what evil is, and what good is. When these truths enter, then the interiors are raised above self, and are thus withdrawn from 
those things which are beneath self, thus from evils. From this it can be seen that all purification or removal from evils is effected by means of truths, which are consequently called "purifying truths." </p>

'And you shall take the silver of expiations from the children of Israel' means the purifying truths springing from good that are the Church's. This is clear from the meaning of 'the silver' as truth 
springing from good, dealt with in <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="2954.htm">2954</a>, <a href="5658.htm">5658</a>, <a href="6112.htm">6112</a>, <a href="6914.htm">6914</a>, <a href="6917.htm">6917</a>, <a href="8932.htm">8932</a>; from the meaning of 'expiations' as purification from evils, dealt with above in <a href="10218.htm">10218</a>, so that 'the silver of expiations' 
is truth that purifies; and from the representation of 'the children of Israel' as the Church, dealt with in the places referred to in <a href="9340.htm">9340</a>. The words 'truth that purifies' are used because all purification 
from evils is effected by means of truths, see <a href="2799.htm">2799</a>, <a href="5954.htm">5954</a>, <a href="7044.htm">7044</a>, <a href="7918.htm">7918</a>, <a href="9089.htm">9089</a>. The implications of all this are that by himself a person thinks nothing but evil; for by himself he does not think 
about God nor about good and just behaviour towards his neighbour, unless it is to his own advantage. Nor indeed does he think about heaven and eternal life, only about the world and life there. As long 
as this is a person's state of mind his thought springs from what is below him and not from what is above him, thus from hell and not from heaven. To think what is good therefore a person's thought 
must spring from heaven, so that his mind must be raised in that direction. This is accomplished solely by means of truths such as exist within the Church, derived from the Word; for those truths teach 
about the nature of God, who the neighbour is, the existence of heaven, the reality of eternal life, and in particular what evil and good are. When these truths pass into the mind its inner levels 
are raised above the self, and are accordingly drawn away from those things below the self, thus away from evils. From this it may be recognized that all purification or removal from evils is effected 
by means of truths, which are therefore called purifying truths.  </p>

`Et accipies argentum expiationum a cum filiis Israelis': quod significet vera ex bono purificantia quae Ecclesiae, constat ex significatione `argenti' quod sit verum ex bono, de qua n. 1551, 2954, 
5658, 6112, 6914, 6917, 8932, ex significatione `expiationum' quod sint purificatio a malis, de qua supra n. 10,218, ita `argentum expiationum' est verum purificans; et ex repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis' 
quod sint Ecclesia, de qua citata n. 9340. Verum purificans dicitur quia omnis purificatio a malis fit per vera, videatur n. (x)2799, 5954, 7044, 7918, 9089. Cum his ita se habet: homo ex se 
non cogitat nisi quam malum, ex se enim non cogitat de Deo, nec de bono et justo erga proximum, nisi propter se; immo nec de caelo et de vita aeterna, sed de mundo et de vita ibi; quamdiu homo in tali 
statu est, cogitat ex illis quae infra se (d)sunt et non ex illis quae supra se sunt, ita ex inferno et non ex caelo; ut itaque homo cogitet bonum, cogitare debet ex caelo, proinde ejus mens illuc elevari 
debet; hoc fit unice per vera qualia sunt in Ecclesia ex Verbo, illa enim docent quid Deus, quid proximus, quod sit caelum, {1} quod vita aeterna, et in specie quid malum et quid bonum; cum haec 
vera intrant, tunc elevantur interiora supra se, et sic abducuntur ab illis quae infra se sunt, ita a malis; inde constare potest quod omnis purificatio seu remotio a malis fiat per vera, quae inde dicuntur 
vera purificantia. @1 i et$ </p>
