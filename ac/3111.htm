<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3111节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3111.</strong>“请告诉我，你父亲家里有让我们过夜的地方吗”表关于仁之善的调查。这从“请告诉我，有地方吗”、“家”、“父亲”和“过夜的地方”的含义清楚可知：“请告诉我，有地方吗”是指调查，在此是指调查；“家”是指良善（参看<a href="2048.htm">2048</a>，<a href="2233.htm">2233</a>，<a href="2331.htm">2331</a>节）；这里的“父亲”，也就是彼土利，是指仁之善，就是诸如相对正直的外邦人所具有的那类仁之善（参看<a href="2863.htm">2863</a>节），利百加所代表的真理情感的真正起源就来自这类良善；“过夜的地方”是指居住的状态（参看下文，<a href="3115.htm">3115</a>节）。<br />就内义而言，之所以描述对真理情感在纯真和仁之善方面起源的调查，是因为要被引入良善并与其联结的真理，其最初起源并非来自其它源头。这一事实从所有接受真理，并且这真理与良善结婚的人身上可以看出来。在教会中，那些没有某种程度的纯真或对邻之仁的人，无论多么熟悉真理，无论口头上如何宣称它，绝不会发自内心承认它。在来世，对于教会之外被呼召到信之真理面前，或在信之真理上接受教导的外邦人来说，只有那些拥有纯真，彼此过着仁爱生活的人才会接受它。事实上，信之真理只能在纯真和仁爱所产生的土壤中扎根并生长。</p>

Tell me I pray is there room in thy father's house for us to pass the night? That this signifies exploration concerning the good of charity, is evident from the signification of "tell me I pray is there," 
as being exploration; from the signification of a "house," as being good (see n. 2048, 2233, 2331); and from the signification of "father," in this case, Bethuel, as being the good of charity such 
as there is with the better Gentiles (see n. 2865)-the very origin of the affection of truth represented by Rebekah being from such good-and from the signification of "room to pass the night," as being 
a state of "abiding" (see below, n. 3115).  [2] That there is in the internal sense a description of the exploration concerning the origin of the affection of truth as to innocence and the good 
of charity, is for the reason that the truth which is to be initiated and conjoined with good derives its first origin from no other source, as may be seen from all those with whom truth is received and 
wedded to good. Within the church, they who have not some measure of innocence and of charity toward the neighbor, howsoever they may be acquainted with truth and profess it with the lips, yet in no 
wise do they acknowledge it at heart. Outside of the church, among the Gentiles who are called to the truth of faith, or are instructed concerning it in the other life, no others receive it than those 
who are in innocence, and who live together in mutual charity; for innocence and charity produce the ground in which the seeds of faith can take root and grow. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3111</b></p><p><b>3111.</b>
'Tell me now, is there at your father's house a place for us to spend the night?' means investigation concerning the good of charity. This is clear from the meaning of 'tell me now, is there?' as investigation; 
from the meaning of 'house' as good, dealt with in <a href="2048.htm">2048</a>, <a href="2233.htm">2233</a>, <a href="2331.htm">2331</a>; from the meaning of 'father' here, that is to say, of Bethuel, as the good of charity, such as exists with the more upright 
gentiles, dealt with in <a href="2863.htm">2863</a> - the origin itself also of the affection for truth, which Rebekah represents, existing in such good; and from the meaning of 'a place to spend the night' as a state 
of abiding, dealt with below in <a href="3115.htm">3115</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why investigation concerning the origin of the affection for truth as regards innocence and as regards the good of charity is described in the 
internal sense is that truth which is to be introduced into and joined to good does not have its first origin in any other source, as becomes clear from all with whom truth is received and wedded to good. 
Inside the Church, no matter how much those who do not possess any innocence or charity towards the neighbour know the truth and confess it with their lips, they in no way acknowledge it in their 
hearts. And outside the Church, in the case of gentiles who are called to the truth of faith or who receive instruction in it in the next life, only those receive it who possess innocence and lead charitable 
lives one with another. In fact innocence and charity constitute the ground in which the seeds of truth are able to take root and spring up. </p>

`Indica quaeso mihi, an est domo patris tui locus nobis ad pernoctandum': quod significet explorationem de bono charitatis, constat ex significatione `{1}indica quaeso mihi, an' quod sit exploratio; 
ex significatione `domus' quod sit bonum, de qua n. 2048, 2233, 2331; ex significatione `patris' hic, nempe Bethuelis, quod sit bonum charitatis quale apud gentes probiores, de qua n. 2865; ipsa etiam 
origo affectionis veri, quam Rebecca repraesentat, fuit ex tali bono; et ex significatione `loci ad pernoctandum' quod sit status manendi, de qua infra n. 3115. [2] Quod exploratio de origine affectionis 
veri quoad innocentiam et quoad bonum charitatis in sensu interno describatur, causa est quia verum quod initiandum et conjungendum est bono, non aliunde primam originem ducat, ut constare potest 
ab omnibus illis {2}apud quos verum recipitur et innubitur bono; intra Ecclesiam, qui non aliquid innocentiae et charitatis erga proximum habent, verum utcumque norunt, et ore profitentur, nusquam tamen 
corde agnoscunt; extra Ecclesiam, gentiles qui ad verum fidei vocantur, aut de illo in altera vita instruuntur, non alii recipiunt quam qui in innocentia sunt ac inter se in mutua charitate vivunt; 
innocentia enim et charitas faciunt humum in qua semina veri possint radicem agere et egerminare.(s) @1 indicare$ @2 qui verum recipiunt ac innubunt bono$ </p>
