<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5880节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5880.</strong>“他弟兄不能回答他”表属世层中的真理还未处于能对话的状态。这从雅各儿子们的代表和“不能回答”的含义清楚可知：雅各的儿子们，即此处约瑟的“弟兄”，是指属世层中的真理，如前所述（<a href="5877.htm">5877</a>节）；“不能回答”是指还未处于能对话的状态，即基于真理与内在对话。此中情形是这样：当内在与外在联结，或良善与真理联结时，就内在而言，与外在的交流首先得以实现；但这种交流不是相互的，也就是说，就对方而言，交流尚未出现。当交流是相互的时，这二者便联结起来。这解释了为何约瑟伏在便雅悯颈项上哭，又亲吻众弟兄，经上说：他弟兄们才开始和他说话（45:15），由此表示实现联结之后，双方的交流凭接受而得以建立。</p>

And his brethren could not answer him. That this signifies that truths in the natural were not yet in a state to speak, is evident from the representation of the sons of Jacob, who are here Joseph's 
"brethren," as being truths in the natural (of which above, n. 5877); and from the signification of "not being able to answer," as being to be not yet in a state to speak, namely, from the truths with 
the internal. The case herein is this. When the internal is being conjoined with the external, or good with truth, there is then for the first time effected a communication on the part of the internal 
with the external; but the communication is not yet reciprocal. When it is reciprocal, there is conjunction. Wherefore after Joseph had wept upon Benjamin's necks, and had kissed all his brethren, it 
is said that then for the first time his brethren talked with him (verse 15), whereby is signified that after conjunction was effected, there took place a reciprocal communication by virtue of reception. </p>

'And his brothers could not answer him' means that the truths in the natural were not yet in a state of being able to talk. This is clear from the representation of the sons of Jacob, to whom 'Joseph's 
brothers' refers here, as the truths within the natural, dealt with above in <a href="5877.htm">5877</a>; and from the meaning of 'not being able to answer' as not yet being in a state of being able to talk - to talk to 
the internal on the basis of truths. The situation in all this is as follows: When the internal is joined to the external, or good is joined to truth, there is at first a communication with the external 
on the part of the internal, but there is no communication as yet in the opposite direction. When there is, the two exist joined together. This explains verse 15, which says it was after Joseph had 
wept on Benjamin's neck and had kissed all his brothers that the brothers began to talk to him, meaning that after the joining together had been effected a communication in both directions was established 
as a result of acceptance.  </p>

`Et non potuerunt fratres ejus respondere illi':  quod significet quod vera in naturali nondum in statu loquendi essent, constat ex repraesentatione `filiorum Jacobi' qui hic `fratres' Josephi, quod 
sint vera in naturali, de qua {1}supra n. 5877; et (c)ex significatione 'non posse respondere' quod sit nondum esse in statu loquendi, nempe ex veris cum interno. Hoc ita se habet: quando conjungitur 
internum {2} externo, seu bonum {2} vero, tunc primum fit communicatio a parte interni cum externo, at {3} nondum communicatio reciproca; quando haec, est conjunctio; quapropter postquam Josephus fleverat 
super collis Benjaminis, et osculatus omnes fratres suos, dicitur quod tunc primum locuti sint fratres {4} cum illo, vers. 15, {5}quae significant quod postquam conjunctio facta, reciproca communicatio 
ex receptione exstiterit. @1 prius$ @2 i cum$ @3 i vero$ @4 i ejus$ @5 quibus significatur$ </p>
