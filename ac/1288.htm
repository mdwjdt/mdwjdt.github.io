<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1288节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1288.</strong>“一样的话语”表他们在具体细节上也持守一样的教义。这从前面的说明清楚可知，因为“嘴唇”表总体上的教义，这在前面已说明，而“话语”表细节上的教义，即教义的具体细节。因为这些细节只要关注一个目的，即爱主高于一切，并且爱邻如己，就没什么不同。这时，它们就是这些总体的细节。<br />“圣言”表关于仁及其衍生之信的一切教义，“话语”表构成教义的细节。这一点清楚可见于诗篇：<br />我学了你公义的判语，就要以正直的心称谢你。我必守你的律例。少年人用什么洁净他的行为呢？是要遵行你的话语。我一心寻求了你，求你不要叫我偏离你的命令。我将你的话语存在心里，免得我得罪你。耶和华啊，你是应当称颂的！求你将你的律例教训我。我用嘴唇传扬你口中的一切典章。我喜悦你法度的道路。我要默想你的训词，看重你的道路。我要以你的律例为乐，我不忘记你的话语。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗119.7.htm">119:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗119.16.htm">16</a>）<br />“话语”在此表总体上的教义。显而易见，此处对“训词”、“判语”、“法度”、“命令”、“典章”、“道路”、“嘴唇”作了区分；所有这些都属于圣言，或教义。这同样适用于别处的圣言经文，它们表示同样的不同事物。<br />爱慕歌。我心里涌出美辞。我的舌头是快手笔。你在万人中最英俊，在你嘴里满有恩惠。为真理、柔和、公义的话语坐车前往。你的右手必显明可畏的事。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗45.1.htm">45:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗45.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗45.4.htm">4</a>）<br />“为真理、柔和、公义的话语坐车前往”是指教导真理与良善的教义。和别处的圣言经文一样，此处“话语”、“美辞”和“舌头”表不同的事物。显然，它们全都论及有关仁的教义，因为经上称之为“爱慕歌”。“万人中最英俊”、“嘴里满有恩惠”、“右手必显明可畏的事”都论及该教义。以赛亚书：<br />主使一言入于雅各家，落于以色列家。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.8.htm">9:8</a>）<br />“一言”表内在与外在敬拜的教义。此处“雅各”表外在敬拜，“以色列”表内在敬拜。马太福音：<br />耶稣说，人活着，不是单靠食物，乃是靠神口里所出的一切话。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太4.4.htm">4:4</a>）<br /><br />凡听见天国的话语却不理会的，那恶者就来，把所撒在他心里的夺了去。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.19.htm">13:19</a>）<br />关于“话”，也可参看这一章的20-23节。<br />天地要废去，我的话却不能废去。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.35.htm">24:35</a>）<br />此处“话语”（word）表主的教义，而“话”（words）表构成祂教义的事物。<br />由于“话”这个术语表构成教义的一切事物，故十诫被称为“话”。摩西书：<br />耶和华将这约的话，就是十句话，写在两块版上。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.28.htm">34:28</a>）<br />申命记：<br />他将所吩咐你们当守的约指示你们，就是十句话，并将它们写在两块石版上。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申4.13.htm">4:13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申10.4.htm">10:4</a>）<br /><br />你只要谨慎，殷勤保守你的灵魂，免得忘记你亲眼所看见的话。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申4.9.htm">4:9</a>）<br />此外还有其它经文。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1288.</strong> The fact that the same words means that a single detailed view of doctrine existed can be seen from what was said above. A language, [a lip, or speech] symbolizes doctrine in general, as shown, but words symbolize doctrine in particular, that is, particular doctrinal teachings. As noted [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1288/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1285#subsection-2-2" target=_top>1285:2</a>], the specifics do not matter as long as they focus on a united goal, which is to love the Lord above all and to love our neighbor as ourselves, since the specific teachings then fit with these general principles.<br />[2] A word symbolizes the whole body of doctrine concerning neighborly love and the faith that grows out of it, while words in the plural symbolize different aspects of the doctrine. This can be seen in David:<br />I will acclaim you in uprightness of heart, while I learn the judgments of your justice. Your statutes I will keep. With what will a youth purify his course, to keep it, in accord with your word? With my whole heart I have sought you; please do not make me stray from your commandments. In my heart have I hidden your word, to prevent my sinning against you. A blessing on you, Jehovah; teach me your statutes. With my lips I have recounted all the judgments of your mouth. In the path of your testimonies I have rejoiced. On your requirements I meditate, and I gaze on your paths. In your statutes I take pleasure. I do not forget your word. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1288/bible_king-james-version_psalms_119_7-16" target=_top>Psalms 119:7-16</a>)<br />A word stands for the broad outlines of doctrine. The commandments, judgments, testimonies, requirements, statutes, path, and lips there are distinguished from each other, as is evident, and they are all different types of "word," or doctrinal teaching. Everywhere else in the Word, too, they symbolize distinctly different entities.<br />[3] In the same author:<br />A love song: My heart ponders a good word. My tongue is the pen of a rapid scribe. More beautiful are you than the children of humankind. Grace is poured out on your lips. Ride on the word of truth and gentle justice; your right hand will teach you marvelous things. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1288/bible_king-james-version_psalms_45_1-17" target=_top>Psalms 45</a>: heading, 1, 2, 4)<br />Riding on the word of truth and gentle justice is teaching a doctrine of truth and goodness. As in other places in the Word, a word, mouth, lip, and tongue symbolize different things here. They all have to do with teachings concerning charity, because the psalm is called a song of "loves."{*1} Those teachings are portrayed as having more beauty than the children of humankind, and grace on the lips, and a right hand that teaches marvelous things.<br />[4] In Isaiah:<br />Jehovah has sent word against Jacob, and it has fallen on Israel. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1288/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_9_8" target=_top>Isaiah 9:8</a>)<br />The word stands for teachings having to do with inward and outward worship; Jacob here stands for outward worship and Israel for inward. In Matthew:<br />Jesus said, "Humankind does not live on bread alone but on every word that has come out of God's mouth." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1288/bible_king-james-version_matthew_4_4" target=_top>Matthew 4:4</a>)<br />In the same author:<br />When anyone hears the word concerning the kingdom and pays no attention, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in the person's heart. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1288/bible_king-james-version_matthew_13_19" target=_top>Matthew 13:19</a>)<br />(Verses 20, 21, 22, 23 there also mention "the word.") In the same author:<br />Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1288/bible_king-james-version_matthew_24_35" target=_top>Matthew 24:35</a>)<br />The word in these passages stands for the doctrine concerning the Lord, while words in the plural stand for various parts of that doctrine.<br />[5] Since words stand for all the precepts of a doctrine, the Ten Commandments are called words in Moses:<br />Jehovah wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant — the ten words. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1288/bible_king-james-version_exodus_34_28" target=_top>Exodus 34:28</a>)<br />In the same author:<br />He declared his covenant to you, which he commanded you to do: the ten words. And he wrote them on two stone tablets. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1288/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_4_13" target=_top>Deuteronomy 4:13</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1288/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_10_4" target=_top>10:4</a>)<br />In the same author:<br />Be careful, and guard your soul intently to keep from forgetting the words [things] that your eyes have seen. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1288/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_4_9" target=_top>Deuteronomy 4:9</a>)<br />There are other passages as well.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The Hebrew word for "love" in the heading of the psalm is plural (יְדִידֹת [yǝḏîḏōṯ]), and Swedenborg uses a Latin plural here (amorum), though he has not used a plural in his translation of the heading ("A love song"). [LHC] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1288</b></p><p><b>1288.</b>
Their words were one. That this signifies that there was one doctrine in particular, is evident from what has been said before; for "a lip" signifies doctrine in general, as was shown; and "words" signify 
doctrine in particular, or the particulars of doctrine. For the particulars cause no disagreement, provided they look to one end, which is to love the Lord above all things and the neighbor as oneself; 
for then they are particulars of these generals.  [2] That a "word" signifies all doctrine concerning charity and the derivative faith, and that "words" signify the things which are of doctrine, 
is evident in David: </p>
<p>     I will confess unto Thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall learn the judgments of Thy righteousness; I will keep Thy statutes. Wherewithal shall a child make pure 
his path? By taking heed according to Thy word. With my whole heart have I sought Thee; make me not to wander from Thy precepts. Thy word have I hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against Thee. 
Blessed art Thou, O Jehovah; teach me Thy statutes. With my lips have I rehearsed all the judgments of Thy mouth. I have rejoiced in the way of Thy testimonies. I meditate in Thy commandments, and look 
unto Thy ways. I delight in Thy statutes; I do not forget Thy word (Ps. 119:7-16). "Word" here denotes doctrine in general. It is evident that a distinction is here made between "precepts," "judgments," 
"testimonies," "commandments," "statutes," "way," and "lips;" and that all these belong to the Word, or to doctrine. And everywhere else in the Word they signify the same distinct things.  [3] 
Again: </p>
<p>     A song of love. My heart hath willed a good word; my tongue is the pen of a rapid writer. Thou art beauteous above the sons of man; grace is poured upon thy lips. Ride upon the word of truth; 
and of the gentleness of righteousness; thy right hand shall teach thee wonderful things (Ps. 45:1-2, 4). "To ride upon the word of truth and of the gentleness of righteousness," is to teach the 
doctrine of truth and of good. Here, as elsewhere in the Word, the terms "word," "lip," and "tongue" signify distinct things; that they are things of doctrine concerning charity is evident, because it 
is called "a song of loves." Of this doctrine is predicated beauty above the sons of man, grace of lips, and a right hand that teacheth wonderful things.  [4] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah sent a word unto 
Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel (Isa. 9:8). "A word" denotes the doctrine of internal and of external worship; "Jacob" here denotes external worship, and "Israel" internal. In Matthew: </p>
<p>  
   Jesus said, Man doth not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God (Matt. 4:4). Again: </p>
<p>     When anyone heareth the word of the Kingdom and heedeth it not, then 
cometh the evil one and snatcheth away that which hath been sown in his heart (Matt. 13:19); </p>
<p>see also concerning "the word" in the same chapter, verses 20-23. Again: </p>
<p>     Heaven and earth shall pass 
away, but My words shall not pass away (Matt. 24:35). In these passages, "the word" denotes the Lord's doctrine; and "words" the things that belong to His doctrine.   [5] Because the expression 
"words" denotes all things of doctrine, the commandments of the Decalogue were called "words," in Moses: </p>
<p>     Jehovah wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten words (Exod. 34:28). Again: </p>
<p> 
    He hath declared unto you His covenant, which He commanded you to perform, the ten words; and He wrote them upon two tables of stone (Deut. 4:13; 10:4). Again: </p>
<p>     Take heed to thyself, 
and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the words that thine eyes have seen (Deut. 4:9); </p>
<p>besides other places. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1288</b></p><p><b>1288.</b>
That 'words were one' means that they held to the same doctrine in its particular details is clear from what has been stated already, for 'lip' means doctrine in general, as has been shown, while 'words' 
means doctrine in detail, that is, particular details of doctrine. These, as has been stated make no difference provided they have the same end in view, which is to love the Lord above all things 
and the neighbour as oneself. When they do so they are the details that contribute to the general whole. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That 'the Word' means all doctrine concerning charity and faith derived from it and that 
'words' means the details that constitute doctrine is clear in David, </p>
<blockquote>
I will confess You with uprightness of heart, when I learn Your righteous judgements I will keep Your statutes. How will a young 
man make pure his path? By observing Your Word. With my whole heart I have sought You; cause me not to wander from Your commandments I have laid up Your Word in my heart that I might not sin against 
You. Blessed are You, O Jehovah; teach me Your statutes! With my lips I have declared all the judgements of Your mouth. I have rejoiced in the way of Your testimonies. I meditate on Your commands and 
look to Your ways. I delight in Your statutes, I do not forget Your Word. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20119:7-16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 119:7-16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The Word' stands for doctrine in general. The fact that here commandments, judgements, testimonies, commands, 
statutes, way, and lips, are distinguished shows plainly that they are all features of the Word, that is, of doctrine. The same applies wherever else in the Word these terms are used with different 
meanings. </p>
<p></p>

 In the same author, </p>

</blockquote>
<p>'Riding on the word of truth, and of the meekness of righteousness' 
is teaching the doctrine of truth and good Here, as elsewhere in the Word, word, mouth, lip, and tongue mean differing things. The fact that they all have to do with doctrine concerning charity 
is clear because it is called 'a love song', and it is to this doctrine that 'the fairest of the sons of man', 'grace on the lips', and 'a right hand that teaches marvellous things' have reference. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The Lord<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> has sent a word into Jacob, and it has fallen on Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%209:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 9:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'A word' stands for the doctrine of internal and external worship. Here 'Jacob' stands for external 
worship, 'Israel' for internal. In Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said, Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that goes out of the mouth of God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%204:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 4:4</a>.

<p>In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>'The word' is again referred to in verses 20-23 of that 
chapter. In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2024:35&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 24:35</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'word' stands for the Lord's doctrine and 'words' for the things that constitute 
His doctrine. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Since the term 'words' stands for everything that constitutes doctrine the Ten Commandments are therefore called 'words' in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah. wrote on the tables the words of

Quod 'verba una' significent quod una doctrina in particulari, constat ex illis quae prius dicta sunt, 'labium' enim significat doctrinam in communi, ut ostensum, 'verba' autem doctrinam in particulari 
seu particularia doctrinae; nam particularia nihil faciunt ut dictum, modo spectent unum finem, qui est amare Dominum supra omnia et proximum sicut semet, tunc enim particularia sunt communium.  [2] 
Quod 'Verbum' significet omnem doctrinam de charitate et inde fide, et quod verba, illa quae sunt doctrinae, consta apud Davidem, 	Confitebor Tibi in rectitudine cordis; in discendo me judici justitiae
