<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4944节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4944.</strong>来自世界各地的基督徒当中，那些过着良善的道德生活，拥有某种程度的对邻之仁，却很少关心属灵事物的人，大部分被送到脚和脚底之下的地方，被关在那里，直到他们摆脱他们所沉浸于其中的属世事物，专注于属灵和属天事物，以致这些事物能与他们所过的生活保持一致。一旦专注于这些，他们就会从那里被提升到天上的社群。我有好几次看见他们出现，并看到他们的喜悦，因为他们正进入天堂之光。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4944</b></p><p><b>4944.</b>
They who come out of the world from Christendom, and who have led a good moral life, and have had something of charity toward the neighbor, but have had little concern about spiritual things, are for 
the most part sent into the places under the feet and the soles of the feet; and are kept there until they put off the natural things in which they have been, and become imbued with spiritual and heavenly 
things insofar as they can be in accordance with their life; and when they have become imbued with these, they are elevated thence to heavenly societies. I have at times seen them emerging, and 
beheld their gladness at coming into heavenly light. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4944</b></p><p><b>4944.</b>
Christians coming from the world who have led morally good lives and possessed some degree of charity towards the neighbour, but who have cared little about spiritual matters, are for the most part sent 
to places beneath the feet and soles of the feet where they are kept until they get rid of the natural interests in which they have been immersed and become absorbed in spiritual and celestial interests 
insofar as these are in keeping with the life they lead. Once they have become absorbed in these they are raised up from there to heavenly communities. On several occasions I have seen them emerging 
and have observed their gladness because they were going into heavenly light. </p>

Qui e mundo ex Christiano orbe veniunt, et vitam moralem bonam egerunt et aliquid charitatis erga proximum habuerunt, at spiritualia parum curaverunt, quoad plurimam partem mittuntur in loca sub 
pedibus et plantis et ibi tenentur usque dum naturalia in quibus fuerunt, exuant, ac spiritualia et caelestia quantum possunt secundum vitam, imbuant{1}; quae cum imbuerunt, {2} elevantur abinde ad 
societates caelestes; vidi aliquoties emergentes, et illorum laetitiam quod in lucem caelestem venirent. @1 It is interesting to note in A that S wrote imbu d, induant d, imbuant$ @2 i tunc$ </p>
