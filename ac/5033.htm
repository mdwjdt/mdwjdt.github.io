<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5033节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5033.</strong>“说，你的仆人照这些话待我”表确认。这从他的坚信清楚可知，因为他坚信他的妻子说的是真的，因此就他而言，妻子的指控已经得到证实。说服他的妻子表示非属灵的属世真理，在此表示虚假。非属灵的属世良善很容易允许自己被虚假说服（参看<a href="5032.htm">5032</a>节）。众所周知，虚假能被确认、证实，以至于看上去完全就像真理。这一点从一切异端及其各个细节明显看出来，尽管它们是虚假，但经确认、证实后在那些坚持异端的人看来就像真理。这一点从那些没有宗教信仰的人那里也能明显看出来，因为这些人在思想上坚决反对教会事物，并且如此坚决，以致他们将以下观点视为真理：教会的存在只是为了约束普通老百姓；自然界是全部中的全部，神性则如此遥不可及，以至于几乎什么也不是，人死亡时和动物没什么两样。对于这些和类似观点，那些处于非属灵的属世良善之人比别人更允许自己被说服并确信，因为他们里面可以说没有明镜，只在外面有一面使得虚假看似真实的幻镜。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5033</b></p><p><b>5033.</b>
Saying, According to these words did thy servant to me. That this signifies confirmation, is evident from the belief in which he was that his wife had spoken the truth, and from its being thus confirmed 
to him; for the wife who persuaded him is truth natural not spiritual, but here falsity. That good natural not spiritual suffers itself to be easily persuaded by falsity, may be seen just above (n. 
5032). It is well known that falsities can be confirmed so as to appear altogether as truths. This is plain from every heresy, and all its particulars, which, though they are falsities, yet by confirmations 
appear as truths to those who are in the heresy. It is plain too from those who have no religion, who confirm themselves so thoroughly against the things of the church, that they see as a truth 
the notion that the church is only for the sake of the common people, to keep them in some restraint; also that nature is all in all, and the Divine so remote as to be scarcely anything, and that man 
dies like a beast. Regarding these and the like opinions, they who are in good natural not spiritual suffer themselves to be more easily persuaded and confirmed than others, since they have as it were 
no mirror within, but only outside of them, before which falsities appear as realities. </p>

'Saying, This is what your slave did to me' means corroboration. This becomes clear from his firm belief that his wife had spoken the truth, and that as a result her accusation, so far as he was concerned, 
was corroborated. The wife who convinced him means unspiritual natural truth, though at this point falsity is meant; for unspiritual natural good easily allows itself to be convinced by falsity, 
see immediately above in <a href="5032.htm">5032</a>. It is Well known that falsities can be corroborated to look exactly like truths. This is evident from all heresies and from every aspect of any heresy. Though they are 
falsities, corroborations of them nevertheless cause people who adhere to a heresy to see them as truths. The same point is evident in people who are not religious. These people in their thinking set 
themselves firmly against things of the Church, so firmly that they see as the truth the idea that the Church exists merely to keep the common people down. They also see as the truth the idea that natural 
forces are the be-all and end-all and that the Divine is so remote as to be virtually nothing at all, as well as the idea that in death the human being is no different from any animal. People with 
whom unspiritual natural good resides allow themselves, more easily than others, to be persuaded and convinced of these and similar ideas, for they have no mirror so to speak within themselves, only 
one outside themselves which makes illusions look like realities. </p>

</p><b>5033.</b>
`Dicendo, Secundum verba haec fecit mihi servus tuus': quod significet confirmationem, constare potest ex fide in qua fuit quod uxor ejus verum dixerit, et quod sic confirmatum apud se esset; </p>
<p>`uxor' 
enim quae persuasit, est velum naturale non spirituale, hic autem falsum; quod bonum naturale non spirituale se facile persuaderi patiatur a falso, videatur mox supra n. 5032.  Notum est quod confirmari 
queant falsa ut appareant prorsus sicut vera; hoc patet ex omni haeresi et ex singulis in haeresi, quae tametsi falsa, usque per confirmationes illis qui in haeresi sunt, apparent ut vera; 
tum quoque ex illis qui nullius religionis sunt qui prorsus `confirmant se' contra illa quae Ecclesiae sunt, usque adeo ut videant sicut verum, (m)quod Ecclesia sit modo propter vulgus ut sit in 
aliquo vinculo;(n) tum quod natura sit omne in omnibus, et Divinum tam remotum ut vix sit aliquid; ut et quod homo moriatur sicut bestia; de his et similibus illi qui in bono naturali (o)non spirituali 
sunt, facilius se persuaderi et confirmari patiuntur quam alii, nam his nullum quasi speculum est ab interiore, sed solum ab exteriore, coram quo fallacia apparent sicut realia. </p>
