<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1119节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1119.</strong>实际观察向我表明上古之人的内呼吸如何悄无声息地流入外呼吸，因而流入别人以内在人所感知的默契中。他们说，他们的内呼吸因其对主的爱与信的状态而发生变化。他们还说明了原因，即因为他们在世时与天堂相联，否则就不可能了。事实上，他们与相伴的天使同呼吸。天使拥有与内呼吸相对应的呼吸，他们的呼吸以同样的方式发生变化。天使若遭遇违背爱主信主的事物，就会呼吸困难，但若体验爱与信的快乐，其呼吸就自由通畅。每个人也有类似情形，只是这种情形与其肉体和世俗的爱欲，以及他的基本信念一致。若有反对这些事物的东西出现，他就会呼吸困难，若有符合它们的东西出现，他的呼吸就自由通畅。然而，这些都是外呼吸的变化。关于天使的呼吸，蒙主怜悯，容后再述。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1119.</strong> I had a practical demonstration of the way the internal breathing of the earliest people entered silently into a type of external breathing they had and so into soundless speech. Listeners heard this speech in their inner self.{*1} They said this kind of respiration varied in them, depending on the state of their love for the Lord and faith in him. They told the reason, too, which was that since they were communicating with heaven, they were necessarily breathing in rhythm with the angels who kept them company. Angels do have respiration, and any inner breathing keeps pace with it. They undergo similar changes in their breathing, because when anything arises to oppose love for the Lord or faith in him, they have difficulty breathing, but when they enjoy the good cheer of love and faith, their breathing is free and full. Everyone on earth experiences something similar, but it occurs in connection with our bodily and worldly passions and our convictions. When anything opposes these, we choke, but when anything caters to them, we breathe freely and fully. These facts, however, relate to external breathing.<br />I will have more to say on the respiration of the angels later [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1119/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3883" target=_top>3883-3895</a>], though, with the Lord's divine mercy.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On internal breathing in relation to Swedenborg's own spiritual practice, see note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1119/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_97" target=_top>97</a>.

It has been shown me to the life how the internal respiration of the most ancient people silently flowed into a kind of external and thus tacit speech, perceived by another in his interior man. They 
said that this respiration varied with them, according to the state of their love and faith in the Lord. They gave also as a reason that it could not be otherwise, because they had communication with 
heaven; for they respired with the angels in whose company they were. Angels have a respiration to which internal respiration corresponds; and it likewise varies with them. For when anything befalls them 
which is contrary to love and faith in the Lord, their respiration is restrained; but when they are in the happiness of love and faith, their respiration is free and full. There is something like 
this also with every man, but in accordance with his corporeal and worldly loves and also with his principles. When anything opposes these, there is a restriction of the respiration; and when they are 
favored, the respiration is free and full. These, however, are variations of external respiration. But concerning the respiration of the angels, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. </p>

I have been shown by actually observing it how the internal breathing of the most ancient people flowed in a non-audible manner into a kind of external, and thus non-verbal, speech, which was perceived 
by another person in his interior man. They said that that breathing with them changed according to their state of love and faith in the Lord. They also stated the reason, namely that because they 
had had communication with heaven, it could not be otherwise. In fact they and the angels who accompanied them were breathing in unison. Angels have breathing to which internal breathing corresponds, 
and which with them changes in a similar way. Indeed when they encounter anything contrary to love and faith in the Lord their breathing is laboured, but when they are experiencing the happiness that 
accompanies love and faith, their breathing is full and free. Something similar to this also exists with every human being but in this case everything depends on the bodily and worldly loves and on a 
person's basic assumptions. When anything goes against these he experiences laboured breathing, but when it is in keeping with them his breathing is full and free. These observations however apply to 
external breathing. The subject of angels and their breathing will in the Lord's Divine mercy be dealt with later on. </p>

</p><b>1119.</b>
Ostensum mihi ad vivum fuit quomodo antiquissimorum respiratio interna influxit tacite in quandam externam et sic in tacitam loquelam, perceptam ab altero in ejus interiore homine.  Dicebant quod respiratio 
illa apud illos variata fuerit secundum statum eorum amoris et fidei in Dominum; causa quoque dicta, quod quia communicationem habebant cum caelo, non potuerit aliter esse, respirabant enim cum 
angelis in quorum consortio fuerunt.  Angeli respirationem habent, cui correspondet respiratio interna, et similiter apud illos variatur, cum enim illis aliquid contrarium amori et fidei in Dominum 
obvenit, tunc illis angusta respiratio, cum vero in felicitate amoris et fidei sunt, tunc iis libera et ampla respiratio; cuivis homini etiam simile quid est, sed secundum ejus corporeos et mundanos 
amores et secundum ejus principia quibus cum aliquid contrariatur, eis angustia respirationis est; at cum faventur, eis libera et ampla respiratio, at haec sunt respirationis externae.  Sed de respiratione 
angelorum, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus. </p>
