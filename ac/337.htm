<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">（三）内义</h4><br /><strong>337.</strong>本章探讨上古教会的堕落，或说其教义的歪曲，随之探讨该教会的各种异端教派，它们以该隐及其后裔的名字命名。要知道，除非正确认识真教会的性质，否则，要理解教义如何扭曲，或认清这教会的各种异端教派的本质是不可能的。关于上古教会，前文已作了大量阐述，并表明该教会是属天之人，它承认的信无非是源自爱主爱邻之信。正是经由从主而来的爱，他们才有了信，即对属信的一切有所感知。由于这个缘故，他们甚至不愿提及信，以免它从爱分离，如上所示（<a href="200.htm">200</a>-<a href="203.htm">203</a>节）。这就是属天之人的性质，他的这种性情以诗篇中的代表人物来描述，主在此以“王”的身份被提及，属天之人则以“王子”被提及：<br />“把你的公平赐给王，把你的正义赐给王子。大山小山必因公义为百姓带来平安。诸代中的一代哦，他们必畏惧你和太阳，转向月亮的脸。在祂的日子，义人要发旺，大有平安，直到月亮不再重现。”（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗72.1.htm">72:1</a>，３，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗72.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗72.7.htm">7</a>）<br />“太阳”表爱，“月亮”表信，“大山”和“小山”表上古教会。“诸代中的一代”表大洪水之后的教会。之所以说“直到月亮不再重现”，是因为信必成为爱（也可查看以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.26.htm">30:26</a>所述）。<br />这就是上古教会及其教义的性质。但现今的情形大不相同，因为如今信优先于仁，但主依然通过信植入仁，然后仁成为首要之事。由此可知，上古时代，当人们作出信仰告白，因而将它从爱分离时，教义就被歪曲了。以此方式歪曲教义，即将信从爱分离，或唯独作出信仰告白者，皆被称为“该隐”；这样的事被视为极恶。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]337.</strong> Inner Meaning<br />THE subject here is the deterioration of the earliest church, or the falsification of religious teachings. Heresies and sects are described under the names of Cain and his descendants. In connection with this, we need to understand that we can have no idea how the religion was falsified or what that church's heresies and sects were like unless we are thoroughly acquainted with the nature of the true church. With such acquaintance we can recognize how things stood.<br />The earliest church has already been discussed quite amply. I showed that it was in the form of a heavenly person [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_337/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_162" target=_top>162:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_337/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_200" target=_top>200</a>] and that its adherents did not acknowledge any other faith than one of love for the Lord and for other people [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_337/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_32#subsection-2-2" target=_top>32:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_337/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_202" target=_top>202</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_337/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_281" target=_top>281</a>]. Through that love they received faith from the Lord, or in other words, a perception of all that belongs to faith [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_337/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_104" target=_top>104</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_337/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_125" target=_top>125</a>]. They did not even want to use the word faith for fear it would be separated from love, as shown earlier (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_337/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_200" target=_top>200-203</a>).<br />[2] That is what a person of heavenly character is like, and David, in speaking of the Lord as monarch and of a heavenly person as royal offspring, uses the following images to represent that nature:<br />Give your judgments to the monarch, and your justice to the royal offspring. The mountains will bring peace to the people, as will the hills, in justice. Generation after generation will fear you in the lasting of the sun and before the face of the moon. In their days the upright individual will flourish, as will great peace, until there is no moon. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_337/bible_king-james-version_psalms_72_1" target=_top>Psalms 72:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_337/bible_king-james-version_psalms_72_3" target=_top>3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_337/bible_king-james-version_psalms_72_5" target=_top>5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_337/bible_king-james-version_psalms_72_7" target=_top>7</a>)<br />The sun symbolizes love and the moon faith. The mountains and hills symbolize the earliest church. Generation after generation symbolizes the religions that came after the Flood. It says until there is no moon because faith will be love. See also what is said in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_337/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_30_26" target=_top>Isaiah 30:26</a>.<br />[3] This shows the nature of the earliest church and of its religious thought. Modern times, in which faith comes first, are completely different; but through faith the Lord endows us with charity, and then charity takes highest importance. It follows that religious teachings were falsified in earliest times when people declared their faith and in the process separated faith from love. Those who falsified the religion in this way, dividing faith from love (that is, championing faith alone), were at that time called Cain. To do as they did was scandalous to the earliest people. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 337</b></p><p><b>337.</b>
THE INTERNAL SENSE As this chapter treats of the degeneration of the Most Ancient Church, or the falsification of its doctrine, and consequently of its heresies and sects, under the names of Cain and 
his descendants, it is to be observed that there is no possibility of understanding how doctrine was falsified, or what was the nature of the heresies and sects of that church, unless the nature of 
the true church be rightly understood. Enough has been said above concerning the Most Ancient Church, showing that it was a celestial man, and that it acknowledged no other faith than that which was of 
love to the Lord and toward the neighbor. Through this love they had faith from the Lord, or a perception of all the things that belonged to faith, and for this reason they were unwilling to mention 
faith, lest it should be separated from love, as was shown above (n. 200, 203).  [2] Such is the celestial man, and such he is described by representatives in David, where the Lord is spoken of as the 
king, and the celestial man as the king's son: </p>
<p>     Give the king Thy judgments, and Thy righteousness to the king's son. The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the hills in righteousness. 
They shall fear Thee with the sun, and toward the faces of the moon, generation of generations. In his days shall the righteous flourish, and abundance of peace, until there be no moon (Ps. 72:1, 
3, 5, 7). By the "sun" is signified love; by the "moon" faith; by "mountains" and "hills" the Most Ancient Church; by "generation of generations" the churches after the flood; "until there be no moon" 
is said because faith shall be love. (See also what is said in Isaiah 30:26.)  [3] Such was the Most Ancient Church, and such was its doctrine. But the case is far different at this day, for now faith 
takes precedence over charity, but still through faith charity is given by the Lord, and then charity becomes the principal. It follows from this that in the most ancient time doctrine was falsified 
when they made confession of faith, and thus separated it from love. Those who falsified doctrine in this way, or separated faith from love, or made confession of faith alone, were then called "Cain;" 
and such a thing was then regarded as an enormity. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 337</b></p><p><b>337.</b>
THE INTERNAL SENSE    Since the subject in this chapter is the degeneration of the Most Ancient Church - that is, the falsification of doctrine - and consequently the heresies and sects which the names 
of Cain and his descendants cover, it must be realized that nobody can begin to understand how doctrine was falsified, that is, understand the nature of the heresies and sects of that Church, unless 
he has a proper knowledge of the nature of the true Church. From the latter the nature of those heresies and sects can be recognized. The Most Ancient Church has been dealt with quite extensively 
already; and it has been shown that it was the celestial man, and that it acknowledged no other faith than faith that originated in love to the Lord and towards the neighbour. It was through that love 
from the Lord that they possessed faith, that is, a perception of everything that was a matter of faith. Consequently they were not even willing to mention faith for fear of separating it from love, 
as shown already in <a href="200.htm">200</a>-<a href="203.htm">203</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Such is the nature of the celestial man, that nature being described also by means of representatives in David where the Lord is referred to as 'the King', and the 
celestial man as 'the King's son',  </p>
<blockquote>
Give the King Your judgements, and the King's son Your righteousness. The mountains will bring peace to the people, and the hills, in righteousness. They will fear 
You with the sun and towards the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the moon, a generation of generations. In his days the righteous man will flourish, and much peace, until the moon will be no more. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2072:1,%203,%205,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 72:1, 3, 5, 7</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The 
sun' means love, 'the moon' faith, 'mountains' and 'hills' the Most Ancient Church. 'A generation of generations' means the Church that came after the Flood. The statement 'until the moon will be 
no more' is made because faith will then be love. See also what is written in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isaiah%2030:26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isaiah 30:26</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Such was the nature of the Most Ancient Church and such its doctrine. Nowadays things are altogether 
different, for now faith comes first. But by means of faith the Lord imparts charity, at which point charity becomes the chief thing. Consequently doctrine in most ancient times was falsified when people 
made profession of faith and in so doing separated faith from love. People who falsified doctrine in this way, or who separated faith from love, that is, made profession of faith alone, were at 
that time called 'Cain'; and such a thing with them was a gross error.

SENSUS INTERNUS </p>
<p>HIC quia de degeneratione Ecclesiae Antiquissimae, seu falsificatione doctrinae, et consequenter de haeresibus et sectis sub nominibus Caini et ejus descendentium, agitur, sciendum, 
quod nequaquam intelligi queat quomodo falsificata fuerit doctrina, seu quales fuerint haereses aut sectae illius Ecclesiae, nisi probe sciatur qualis vera Ecclesia; inde cognosci possunt. De Antiquissima 
Ecclesia prius satis multis actum est, et ostensum quod fuerit caelestis homo, et quod non agnoverit aliam fidem quam quae esset amoris in Dominum et erga proximum; per amorem illum a Domino habebant 
fidem seu perceptionem omnium quae erant fidei; quare nec voluerunt nominare fidem, ne separaretur ab amore, ut ostensum prius n. 200-203. Talis est caelestis homo; et quod talis, describitur 
per repraesentativa etiam apud Davidem ubi agitur de Domino, Qui dicitur 'Rex,' et de caelesti homine, qui 'filius Regis,' Judicia Tua Regi da, et justitiam Tuam filio Regis;...ferent montes pacem populo, 
et colles in justitia;...timebant Te cum sole, et ad facies lunae, generatio generationum;... florebit in diebus illius justus, et multa pax, usque dum non luna, Ps. lxxii 1, 3, 5, 7; </p>
<p>per 'solem' 
significatur amor; per 'lunam' fides; per 'montes et colles' Ecclesia Antiquissima; per 'generationem generationum' Ecclesiae postdiluvianae; 'usque dum non luna' dicitur quia fides erit amor; videantur 
quoque quae apud Esaiam xxx 26. Antiquissima Ecclesia fuit talis, et doctrina talis; hodie vero prorsus alia, nam fides hodie praecedit; sed per fidem charitas a Domino donatur, et tunc fit charitas 
principale; quare sequitur quod falsificata antiquissimo tempore fuit doctrina, cum confessi sunt fidem, et sic separarunt fidem ab amore: qui falsificarunt ita doctrinam, aut separarunt fidem ab 
amore, seu fidem solam confessi, ii tunc dicti 'Cain,' et erat tale apud eos enorme. </p>
