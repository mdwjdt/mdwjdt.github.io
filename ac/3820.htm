<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3820节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3820.</strong>“利亚双眼无力”表就其认知而言，对外在真理的情感是软弱的。这从“利亚”的代表、“眼”和“无力”的含义清楚可知：“利亚”是指对外在真理的情感（参看<a href="3793.htm">3793</a>，<a href="3819.htm">3819</a>节）；“眼”是指认知（<a href="2701.htm">2701</a>节）；“无力”是指相对于对内在真理的情感来说就是如此。就其认知而言，或也可说，就那些具有这些情感的人而言，对外在真理的情感就是如此。这一事实从外在（即普遍）观念可以看出来，外在（即普遍）观念尚未充满其具体细节。它们是软弱而摇摇欲坠的观念，可以说一阵风就能把它们吹走，也就是说，每个观点都能将它们争取过来。但是，当这些观念充满其具体细节时，它们就变得坚定而不动摇。因为这时，它们具有拉结的“形体美丽，样貌俊秀”所表示的本质和形式，而拉结代表对内在真理的情感。<br />下面举例说明何谓外在真理及其情感，何谓内在真理及其情感，以及前者相对来说“双眼无力”，而后者则“形体美丽，样貌俊秀”。那些具有外在真理的人只知道要向穷人行善这一普遍真理，却不知道如何分辨谁是真正的穷人，更不知道在圣言中，“穷人”表示那些灵性上贫穷的人。因此，他们既向善人行善，也向恶人行善。殊不知，向恶人行善就是向善人行恶，因为恶人因此得着机会向善人行恶。这就是为何拥有这种简单热情的人最容易招惹狡猾的骗子。而那些具有内在真理的人则知道谁是穷人，并区别对待，照着各人的品质向他行善。<br />另举一例。那些具有外在真理的人只知道当爱邻舍这一普遍真理，他们以为每个人都是同等程度的邻舍，因而要以同样的爱拥抱每个人。由于这种信念，他们让自己被误导。然而，那些具有内在真理的人知道每个人属于哪种程度的邻舍，并且每个人成为邻舍的程度都是与众不同的。所以，他们知道那些具有外在真理的人所不知的无数事物。因此，他们不会让自己仅仅由于邻舍这个名而被误导，也不会因行了唯独这个名说服他们去行的良善而做出恶事。<br />再举一例。那些仅有外在真理的人以为在来世，有学问的人会如星辰闪耀，所有在主的葡萄园中作工的人都会得到比其他人更大的赏赐。而那些具有内在真理的人则知道，“学问”、“智慧”和“聪明”这些词用来表示那些具有良善的人，无论他们有没有人类的智慧和聪明，正是这些人如星辰闪耀。他们还知道，在主的葡萄园中作工的人各自会照着对激励他作工的对良善与真理的情感而得到赏赐；那些为了自我和尘世，也就是为了自高自傲和财富而作工的人活在肉身时就已得到回报，但在来世，他们的命运就是与恶人同在（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.22.htm">7:22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.23.htm">23</a>）。从这些例子明显可知，那些仅有外在真理的人在认知上何等软弱！内在真理则赋予他们本质与形式，并决定了他们所具有的良善的品质。然而，那些在世时具有外在真理，同时具有简单良善的人到了来世会接受内在真理和由此产生的智慧；因为他们凭简单的良善而处于正确的状态，并具有授受它们的能力。</p>

And Leah's eyes were weak. That this signifies that the affection of external truth is such in regard to the understanding of it is evident from the representation of Leah as being the affection of external 
truth (see n. 3793); from the signification of "eyes" as being the understanding (n. 2701); and from the signification of "weak" as being relatively such. That the affections of external truth 
are weak in regard to the understanding; or what is the same, that they who are in them are so, may be seen from external, that is, general, ideas that are not yet illustrated by singulars, in that they 
are infirm and wavering, and are as it were carried away by every breath of wind, or in other words, suffer themselves to be drawn over to every opinion; whereas when the same have been illustrated 
by singulars, they become firm and steadfast, for from these they have the things both essential and formal which are signified by the "beautiful form and beautiful look of Rachel," by whom are represented 
the affections of interior truth. [2] What is meant by external truths and their affections, and by internal truths and their affections, and by the former being relatively weak-eyed, and the 
latter beautiful in form and look, may be illustrated by an example. They who are in external truths know the mere general truth that good is to be done to the poor; and they do not know how to discern 
who are truly poor, and still less that by the "poor" in the Word are meant those who are spiritually so. In consequence of this, they do good alike to the evil and the good, not being aware that doing 
good to the evil is doing evil to the good, for thus there is given the evil the means of doing evil to the good; and therefore they who are in such simple zeal are subject to the greatest infestations 
from the cunning and deceitful. They on the contrary who are in internal truths know who are the poor, and discriminate among them, and do good to everyone according to his quality. [3] To take 
another example: they who are in external truths know the mere general truth that they ought to love their neighbor; and they believe that everyone is the neighbor in the same degree, and thus that 
everyone is to be embraced with the same love, and so they suffer themselves to be led astray. But they who are in internal truths know in what degree everyone is the neighbor, and that each person is 
so in a different degree. Consequently they know innumerable things of which those who are in external truths are ignorant; and therefore they do not suffer themselves to be led away by the mere name 
of neighbor, nor to do evil from the persuasion of good which the name induces. [4] To take yet another example: they who are in external truths alone, suppose that in the other life the learned will 
shine like the stars; and that all who have labored in the Lord's vineyard will receive a reward above others. But they who are in internal truths know that by the "learned," the "wise," and the "intelligent," 
are signified those who are in good, whether they be in any human wisdom and intelligence or not, and that these shall shine as the stars; and that they who labor in the Lord's vineyard receive 
a reward each in accordance with the affection of good and truth from which he labors; and that they who labor for the sake of themselves and the world, that is, for the sake of self-exaltation 
and opulence, have their reward in the life of the body; but in the other life have their lot with the wicked (Matt. 7:22, 23). Hence it is manifest how weak in understanding are they who are only in 
external truths; and that internal truths are what give to these essence and form, and also give quality to the good with them. Nevertheless they who during their life in this world are in external truths 
and at the same time in simple good, in the other life receive internal truths and the consequent wisdom; for from simple good they are in a state and capacity of reception. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3820</b></p><p><b>3820.</b>
'And Leah's eyes were weak' means that the affection for external truth is weak so far as the understanding of it is concerned. This is clear from the representation of 'Leah' as the affection for external 
truth, dealt with in <a href="3793.htm">3793</a>, and immediately above in <a href="3819.htm">3819</a>; from the meaning of 'the eyes' as the understanding, dealt with in <a href="2701.htm">2701</a>; and from the meaning of 'weak' as its being such in comparison 
with the affection for internal truth. The fact that affections for external truth are weak so far as the understanding of it is concerned, or what amounts to the same, so far as people governed by those 
affections are concerned, becomes clear from external - that is, general - ideas which have not yet been filled in with their particular details. They are feeble and shaky ideas, which so to speak 
allow themselves to be carried along by every puff of wind, that is, to be won over to every opinion. But when those same ideas have been filled in with their particular details they emerge as firm 
and steadfast ideas, for they then possess the essence and form meant by 'beautiful in form and beautiful in appearance' as Rachel was, who represents the affections for interior truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Let the 
following example show what is meant by external truths and the affections for them, and what by internal truths and the affections for these, and the fact that the former are 'weak eyed' in comparison 
with the latter, which are 'beautiful in form and appearance': Those governed by external truths know no more than the general truth that good should be done to the poor. They do not know how to tell 
who are truly the poor, let alone know that in the Word the expression 'the poor' is used to mean those who are so spiritually. Consequently they do good to bad persons and to good ones alike, without 
realizing that doing good to bad people is doing bad to good, for the bad are then given the opportunity to do bad to those who are good. This is why people possessing this kind of simple zeal are 
infested so strongly by the crafty and deceitful. But those governed by internal truths know who the poor are, tell one poor person from another, and do good to each according to his individual character. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
Take another example. Those governed by external truths know no more than the general truth that the neighbour ought to be loved. They as a consequence believe that every individual is the 
neighbour in the same degree, and so every individual ought to be embraced with the same love. Believing this, they allow themselves to be misguided. Those however who are governed by internal truths 
know which degree of the neighbour each person belongs to and that any one person is the neighbour in a different degree from another. Consequently they are aware of countless things which those governed 
by external truths do not know. They do not therefore allow themselves to be led astray by the mere name of neighbour, or to do what is evil by performing that good which the name alone persuades 
them to do. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Take yet another example. Those governed by external truths alone imagine that the learned will shine like stars in the next life, and that all who have worked in the Lord's vineyard 
will have a greater reward than others. But those governed by internal truths know the expressions 'reamed', 'wise', and 'intelligent' are used to mean those in whom good is present, whether they 
possess any human wisdom and intelligence or not, and that it is these who will shine like stars. They also know that those who work in the vineyard receive a reward, each according to the affection for 
good and truth which motivated him in his work, and that those who work from selfish and worldly motives, that is, from self- aggrandizement and enrichment as motives, have their reward during their 
lifetime, but in the next life their lot is with the evil there, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%207:22,%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 7:22, 23</a>. </p>
<p>From these examples it is evident how weak in understanding those people are who are governed by external truths alone, 
and that internal truths are what give them essence and form, and also what determine the character of the good with them. Nevertheless people governed by external truths, and at the same time when 
in the world simple good was present in them, receive internal truths and resulting wisdom in the next life, for by virtue of that simple good they are in the right state and have the capacity to 
receive them. </p>

`Et oculi Leae debiles':  quod significet affectionem veri externi quoad intellectum ejus quod talis, constat ex repraesentatione `Leae' quod sit affectio veri externi, de qua n. 3793, et mox supra 
n. 3819; ex significatione `oculorum' quod sint intellectus, de qua n. 2701; et ex significatione `debilis' quod sit respective talis.  Quod affectiones veri externi sint quoad intellectum debiles, 
seu quod idem, qui in illis sunt, constare potest ab externis, hoc est, communibus ideis quae nondum illustratae sunt a singularibus, quod infirmae sint et vacillent, {1}et quasi ad quemcumque 
ventum ferri, hoc est, ad quamcumque opinionem trahi se patiantur, at cum eaedem illustratae sunt a singularibus, quod firmae evadant et consistant, nam inde illis essentialia et formalia, quae significantur 
per `pulchram forma et pulchram aspectu' quae `Racheli,' per quam affectiones interioris veri repraesentantur.  [2]Quid externa vera {2}et affectiones eorum, et quid interna vera et eorum 
affectiones, et quod illae sint `debiles oculis' respective, et hae `pulchrae forma et aspectu,' sit pro exemplo:  qui in externis veris sunt, modo commune hoc sciunt, quod pauperibus benefaciendum, 
nec sciunt discernere quinam vere pauperes sunt, minus quod per pauperes in Verbo intellecti sint illi qui spiritualiter tales sunt, inde aeque benefaciunt malis quam bonis, non scientes quod benefacere 
malis sit malefacere bonis, nam sic datur malis copia bonis malefaciendi, quare illi qui in simplici tali zelo sunt, ab astutis et dolosis quam maxime infestantur; at qui in internis veris 
sunt, sciunt quinam pauperes sunt, et discernunt inter quoscumque, et cuivis secundum quale ejus benefaciunt.  [3]Sit quoque pro exemplo:  qui in externis veris sunt, modo commune hoc sciunt, quod 
amandus proximus, et {3}credunt quod unusquisque in simili gradu proximus sit, et sic quod unusquisque simili amore amplectendus, et {4}ita se seduci patiuntur; qui autem in internis veris sunt, 
{5}scient in quo gradu quisque proximus est, et quod unusquisque in dissimili, inde innumerabilia sciunt prae illis, proinde se non abduci patiuntur a solo nomine proximi, et ad faciendum malum ex persuasione 
boni quam inducit nomen.  [4]Sit etiam pro exemplo:  qui solum in externis veris sunt, putant quod docti sicut stellae lucebunt in altera vita, et quod omnes qui in vinea Domini laborarunt, 
mercedem prae aliis habebunt; at qui in internis veris sunt, sciunt quod per doctos, sapientes et intelligentes' significentur illi qui in bono sunt, utcumque non in aliqua sapientia et intelligentia 
humana, et quod illi sicut stellae lucebunt; et quod qui in vinea {6}laborant, quisque secundum affectionem boni et veri ex qua laborat, mercedem {6}obtineant, et quod qui propter se et mundum, 
hoc est, propter excellentiam sui et opulentiam {7}laborant, mercedem suam {8}habeant in vita corporis, sed in altera vita sors {8}illis sit cum malis ibi, Matth. vii 22, 23.  Inde patet quam 
debiles intellectu sunt illi qui solum in externis veris {8}; et quod interna vera sint, quae essentiam et formam illis dant, et quoque qualificant bonum apud illos.  At usque qui in externis veris 
sunt, et simul in simplici bono cum in mundo vivunt, illi in altera vita interna vera et inde sapientiam recipiunt, nam ex simplici bono in statu et facultate sunt illa recipiendi. @1 i et mutent$ @2
