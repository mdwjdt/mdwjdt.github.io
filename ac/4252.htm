<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4252节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4252.</strong>创世记32:9-12.雅各说，耶和华啊，我祖亚伯拉罕的神，我父亲以撒的神啊，你曾对我说，回你本地本族去，我要厚待你；你向仆人所施的一切慈爱和一切信实，我一点也不配得。我先前只拿着我的杖过这约旦河，如今我却成了两营了。求你救我脱离我哥哥的手，就是以扫的手，因为我怕他来杀我，连母亲和儿女都不放过。你曾说，我必定厚待你，使你的种如同海边的沙，多得不可胜数。<br />“雅各说，耶和华啊，我祖亚伯拉罕的神，我父亲以撒的神啊”表预备和安排的神圣。“你曾对我说，回你本地本族去，我要厚待你”表为了与神性良善和真理结合。“你向仆人所施的一切慈爱和一切信实，我一点也不配得”表在良善与真理面前谦卑的状态。“我先前只拿着我的杖过这约旦河，如今我却成了两营了”表祂从拥有极少到现在拥有很多。“求你救我脱离我哥哥的手，就是以扫的手，因为我怕他”表相对良善来说，真理的状态，在这种状态下，真理曾使自己成为首先的。“来杀我，连母亲和儿女都不放过”表它即将灭亡。“你曾说，我必定厚待你”表尽管如此，那时它仍将获得生命。“使你的种如同海边的沙，多得不可胜数”表那时必繁殖、增多。<br />4252a.“雅各说，耶和华啊，我祖亚伯拉罕的神，我父亲以撒的神啊”表预备和安排的神圣。这从“我祖亚伯拉罕的神”和“我父亲以撒的神”的含义清楚可知：“我祖亚伯拉罕的神”是指主的神性本身（参看<a href="3439.htm">3439</a>节）；“我父亲以撒的神”是指祂的神性人身（<a href="3704.htm">3704</a>，<a href="4180.htm">4180</a>节）。由于每一个都是耶和华，故经上说“耶和华啊，我祖亚伯拉罕的神，我父亲以撒的神啊”。然而，此处神圣是指从神性发出之物，因为一切神圣皆由此而来。之所以表示神圣，是因为这一切都在由“雅各”所代表的属世层里面，而“以扫”所代表的良善还没有与真理结合。因为现在所论述的主题是对良善的接受状态，在此是为接受它而预备和安排的状态。雅各的祈祷并不包含别的什么，因此他所说的这些话表示预备和安排的神圣。</p>

Verses 9-12. And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, that saith unto me, Return unto thy land, and to thy birth, and I will do well with thee; I am less than 
all the mercies, and all the truth which Thou hast done with Thy servant; for in my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am in two camps. Rescue me I pray from the hand of my brother, from the 
hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother upon the sons. And thou saidst, I will surely do well with thee, and I will make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which is not numbered 
for multitude. "And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah" signifies the holy of preparation and disposal; "that saith unto me, Return unto thy land, and to 
thy birth, and I will do well with thee" signifies for conjunction with Divine good and truth; "I am less than all the mercies, and all the truth, which Thou hast done with Thy servant" signifies humiliation 
in that state as to good and as to truth; "for in my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am in two camps" signifies that from little there was now much. "Rescue me I pray from the hand 
of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him" signifies the state relatively, because it made itself prior; "lest he come and smite me, the mother upon the sons" signifies that it is about to 
perish; "and thou saidst, I will surely do well with thee" signifies that nevertheless it would then obtain life; "and I will make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which is not numbered for multitude" 
signifies that there would then be fructification and multiplication. </p>
<p>4252a. And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah. That this signifies the holy of preparation 
and disposal, is evident from the signification of "God of my father Abraham," as being the Divine Itself of the Lord (see n. 3439); and from the signification of "God of my father Isaac," as 
being His Divine Human (n. 3704, 4180). And because each is Jehovah, it is said, "O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah." But here is signified the holy which proceeds from 
the Divine, for all the holy is therefrom. That the holy is signified is because it was in the natural which is represented by Jacob wherein the good represented by Esau was not yet conjoined with 
truth. For the subject is now the state of the reception of good; here, the state of preparation and disposal for its being received. Jacob's supplication involves nothing else; and therefore by these 
words is signified the holy of preparation and disposal. </p>

Verses 9-12 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, who says to me, Return to your land, and to the place of your nativity, and I will deal well with you; I 
am not worthy of all the mercies and of all the truth which You have shown to Your servant, for with just my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I have become two camps. Deliver me, I pray, from 
the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he comes and smites me, the mother with the children.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> And You have said, I will certainly deal well with you and I will make your seed 
like the sand of the sea which cannot be counted for multitude. </p>
<p>'Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah' means the holiness of preparation and arrangement. 
'Who says to me, Return to your land, and to the place of your nativity, and I will deal well with you' means to become joined to Divine Good and Truth. 'I am not worthy of all the mercies and of all 
the truth which You have shown to Your servant' means an expression, in that state, of humbleness before good and before truth. 'For with just my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I have become 
two camps' means that from having little He now had much. 'Deliver me, I pray, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him' means the state of truth in relation to good, in which 
truth has made itself first. 'Lest he comes and smites me, the mother with the children' means that it is about to perish. 'And You have said, I will certainly deal well with you' means that it would 
nevertheless obtain life then. 'And I will make your seed like the sand of the sea which cannot be counted for multitude' means the fruitfulness and multiplication then.

<p><a href="4252.htm">4252</a>[a] '[Jacob] said, O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah' means the holiness of preparation and arrange meet. This is clear from the meaning of 'the God 
of my father Abraham' as the Lord's Divine itself, dealt with in <a href="3439.htm">3439</a>, and from the meaning of 'the God of my father Isaac' as His Divine Human, dealt with in <a href="3704.htm">3704</a>, <a href="4180.htm">4180</a>. And because each of these is 
'Jehovah', the words used are 'O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah'. Here however the holiness is meant which proceeds from the Divine, for all holiness begins there. The 
reason why holiness is meant is that all this was within the natural, represented by 'Jacob', and good, represented by 'Esau', had not yet been joined in the natural to truth. For the subject now is the 
state when good is received, at this point the state of preparation and arrangement to receive it. Jacob's prayer does not embody anything else, and therefore the words he used mean the holiness of 
preparation and arrangement. </p>

`Dixit, Deus patris mei Abrahami, et Deus patris mei Jishaki, Jehovah': quod significet sanctum praeparationis et dispositionis, constat a significatione `Dei patris Abrahami' quod sit Ipsum Divinum 
Domini, de qua n. 3439; (o)et a significatione `Dei patris mei Jishaki' quod sit Divinum Humanum Ipsius, de qua n. 3704, 4180; et quia utrumque est Jehovah, dicitur `Deus patris mei Abrahami, et 
Deus patris mei Jishaki, Jehovah'; hic autem significatur' sanctum quod procedit a Divino, nam omne sanctum est inde: quod sanctum significetur, est quia in naturali quod repraesentatur per `Jacob,' 
in quo nondum bonum quod repraesentatur per `Esavum,' cum vero conjunctum fuit; agitur {1} enim nunc de statu receptionis boni, hic de statu praeparationis et dispositionis ut reciperetur; supplicatio 
Jacobi non aliud involvit; quapropter significatur per illa verba sanctum praeparationis et dispositionis.      @1 agit$ </p>
