<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1901节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1901.</strong>“也许我可以因她被建立”表理性人有可能以这种方式生出来。这从“被建立”的含义清楚可知，无需进一步解释，当论及重生时，经上就说“被建立”。正如前面所说，“撒莱”表示如妻子一样与良善联结的智性真理。属于至内在的智性真理完全是不毛之地，就象无儿无女的母亲，因为此时，它所流入并经过的理性尚不存在，若没有作为媒介的理性，智性真理无法将任何真理注入外层人。这可从小孩子的情形明显看出来，他们在具备认知之前，根本不知道有关真理的任何知识。但就象前面说的，他们越具备更好、更完美的认知，属于至内在或良善的智性真理就能更好、更完美地得以交流。<br />撒莱所代表的智性真理就是经由天堂、因而经由内在途径所流入的属灵之物本身。它与每个人同在，并不断与通过感官获得并被植入在记忆中的知觉所引入的认知相接触。人意识不到自己里面的这种智性真理，因为它太纯粹，以至于只被感知为一种笼统的概念。它就象照亮心智并赋予认识、思考和理解能力的一种光。由于理性只能通过撒莱所代表的智性真理的流注生成，故它的存在必然与如同它儿子的这个真理有关。当理性通过联结于良善的真理，尤其通过这些真理所源于的良善形成时，它就是正统的儿子。在此之前，它也被视为儿子，不过是非正统的儿子，而是婢女所生的儿子。尽管如此，它仍被接纳，因为经上在此说“可以因她被建立”。</p>

It may be that I shall be built up by her. That this signifies that in this way the rational could be born, may be seen from the signification of being "built up," when predicated of generation, and 
thus without explication. By "Sarai," as has been said, is signified intellectual truth which has been adjoined as a wife to good. Intellectual truth, which appertains to the inmost, is altogether barren, 
or like a childless mother, when as yet there is not any rational into which and through which it may inflow; for without the rational as a medium intellectual truth cannot inflow with any truth 
into the exterior man, as may be seen from the case of little children, who can know nothing whatever of truth until they have been imbued with knowledges; but, as before said, the better and more perfectly 
they are imbued with knowledges, so much the better and more perfectly can intellectual truth which appertains to the inmost, or to good, be communicated.  [2] This intellectual truth, represented 
by Sarai, is the spiritual itself which flows in through heaven, and this by an internal way, and with every man; and it continually meets the knowledges that are insinuated by means of the things 
of sense, and are implanted in the memory. Man is not aware of this intellectual truth because it is too pure to be perceived by a general idea. It is like a kind of light that illuminates the mind, 
and confers the faculty of knowing, thinking, and understanding. As the rational cannot come into existence except by means of the influx of the intellectual truth represented by Sarai, it stands related 
to this truth as a son. When the rational is being formed from truths that have been adjoined to good, and still more when it is being formed from the goods from which are truths, it is then a genuine 
son. Before this it is indeed acknowledged as a son, yet not as a genuine son, but as coming from a handmaid; and still it is adopted, which is the reason why it is here said that she might be built 
up by her. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1901</b></p><p><b>1901.</b>
'Perhaps I shall be built up from her' means the possibility of the rational being born in that way. This becomes clear from the meaning, when it has reference to human generation, of 'being built up', 
and so needs no further explanation. 'Sarai', as stated, means intellectual truth which has been allied as a wife to good. Intellectual truth which resides inmostly is totally lacking in offspring 
or is like a childless wife,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> if there is not as yet any rational into which and through which it may flow, for without the rational as a go-between it cannot flow with any truth at all into the exterior 
man, as becomes clear in the case of small children The latter can have no knowledge at all of truth until cognitions have been bestowed on them; but as has been stated the better and more perfectly 
they have cognitions bestowed on them, the better and more perfectly can intellectual truth which resides inmostly, that is, within good, be communicated. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 This intellectual truth represented 
by Sarai is the spiritual itself which flows in by way of heaven, and so by an internal route. It resides in everyone and is continually coming to meet the cognitions that are introduced by means of 
perceptions gained by the senses and implanted in the memory. No one is conscious of that intellectual truth within himself as it is too pure to be perceived by a general idea. It is like a kind of light 
which enlightens the mind and imparts the ability to know, think, and understand. Since the rational cannot come into being except also by means of the influx of intellectual truth, represented by 
Sarai, it inevitably exists in relation to that truth as its son. When the rational is formed from truths that have been allied to goods, more so when it is formed from goods from which truths derive, 
it is a true son. Previous to that also it is recognized as a son, yet not as a true son but as one born from a servant-girl. All the same, it is adopted as such, and for the reason here stated, that 
it was 'to be built up from her'.

`Et forte aedificabor ab ea': quod significet sic nasci posse rationale, constare potest a significatione `aedificari,' cum praedicatur de generatione, ita absque explicatione.  Per `Sarai,' ut dictum, 
significatur verum intellectuale quod sicut uxor adjunctum est bono: verum intellectuale quod est apud intimum, est prorsus orbum, `aut sicut improlis mater, quando nondum aliquod rationale est in 
quod et per quod influat, nam absque rationali medio non potest influere cum aliquo vero in exteriorem hominem; ut constare potest ab infantibus; hi ne hilum veri scire possunt priusquam cognitionibus 
imbuti sunt, at quo melius et perfectius, ut dictum, imbuuntur cognitionibus, e melius et perfectius potest verum intellectuale quod apud intimum est seu apud bonum, communicari: [2] hoc verum intellectuale 
per `Sarai' repraesentatum est ipsum spirituale quod per caelum influit, (o)et' sic per viam internam, et hoc apud unumquemvis hominem, et jugiter obviam venit cognitionibus quae insinuantur 
per sensualia et implantantur memoriae, quod homo nescit quia purius est quam `communi idea possit percipi; est sicut lux quaedam quae illuminat et dat facultatem sciendi, cogitandi et intelligendi.  
Rationale quia non existere potest nisi etiam per influxum veri intellectualis per `Sarai' repraesentati, non aliter se habet ac filius ejus; quando rationale formatur ex veris quae adjuncta sunt bonis, 
et magis cura ex bonis quibus vera, tunc est filius genuinus; antea quoque agnoscitur ut filius at non ut genuinus sed ex ancilla, usque tamen adoptatur, quae causa est quod hic dicatur quod `aedificaretur 
ab ea.' 	@1 et.$ </p>
