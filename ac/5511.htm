<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5511节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5511.</strong>“对我们严厉的话”表因没有一致性而未与该层联结。这从“说严厉话”的含义清楚可知：“说严厉话”在论及相对于脱离内在的外在的内在时，是指因没有一致性而未联结，如前所述（<a href="5422.htm">5422</a>，<a href="5423.htm">5423</a>节）。事实上，如果外在与内在没有一致性，在内在里面并出于内在的一切事物在外在看来，似乎很严厉，因为这二者没有联结起来。例如，如果内在或活在其内在中的人声称人的思维丝毫不是始于他自己；相反，他的思维要么从天堂，也就是从主经由天堂，要么从地狱来到他这里；如果他声称他对于良善所持有的任何思维都是从主经由天堂来的，而对于邪恶所持有的任何思维都是从地狱来的，那么这种观念对渴望凭自己思考，觉得如果这种“严厉”的观念是真的，他就什么也不是的人看来，完全是严厉的。然而，这种观念是绝对正确的，凡在天堂里的人都能发觉事实的确如此。<br />如果内在，或活在其内在中的人声称，天使所享有的喜乐源于对主之爱和对邻之仁，也就是说，当他们实实在在地实践爱与仁的行为时，这些行为里面所含有的喜乐和幸福如此之大，以至于无法描述，情形也一样。这一点在那些其喜乐唯独源于自我之爱和尘世之爱，并且若不是为自己的缘故，就对邻舍不感兴趣的人看来，也是“严厉”的观念。然而，当人的自尊或自我欣赏、关注在他所履行的功用中逐渐消失时，天堂及其喜乐才开始在他里面存在。<br />再举一例。如果内在声称，人的灵魂无非是内在人；而死后内在人看上去就是人，和在世时一模一样，有一样的脸，一样的身体，一样的感觉，一样的思维能力。在那些对于灵魂持这种观念，即：灵魂仅仅是一种思维能力，因此就像某种缺乏任何外在形式的空灵之物，并且灵魂会再度披上它的肉身之人看来，内在对于灵魂的性质所宣称的，与真理相去甚远。事实上，那些以为仅仅肉体才是人的人在听说灵魂才是此人自己，并且在来世，被埋葬的肉体什么用处也没有时，就会觉得这种观念很“严厉”。我知道这是真理，因为蒙主的神性怜悯，我已经来到来世之人中间，不是在少数人中间，而是在多数人中间，不是一次两次，而是经常；我曾与他们谈论过这个话题。在无数其它事上也是一样。</p>

Hard things with us. That this signifies non-conjunction therewith on account of noncorrespondence, is evident from the signification of "speaking hard things," when predicated of the internal relatively 
to the external separate from it, as being nonconjunction on account of non-correspondence (of which above, n. 5422, 5423); for if there is no correspondence of the external with the internal, then 
all that which is internal and comes from the internal appears hard to the external, because there is no conjunction. As for example-if it is said by the internal, or by one who is in what is internal, 
that man thinks nothing from himself, but either from heaven, that is, through heaven from the Lord, or from hell-if he thinks good, that it is through heaven from the Lord, if evil, that it is from 
hell-this appears altogether hard to him who desires to think from himself, and who believes that if this were as stated he would be nothing at all; when yet it is most true, and all who are in heaven 
are in the perception that it is so. [2] In like manner if it is said by the internal, or by those who are in what is internal, that the joy the angels have is from love to the Lord and from charity 
toward the neighbor-that is, when they are in the use of performing the things of love and charity-and that in these there is so great a joy and happiness as to be quite inexpressible, this will 
be hard to those who are in joy only from the love of self and the world, and in no joy from the love of the neighbor except for the sake of self; when yet heaven and the joy of heaven first begin in 
man when his regard to self in the uses which he performs, dies out.  [3] Take this also as an example. If it is said by the internal that the soul of man is nothing else than the internal man, and that 
the internal man after death appears just like man in the world, with a similar face, similar body, and similar sensitive and thinking faculty-to those who have cherished the opinion concerning the 
soul that it is only a power of thought, and thereby as it were ethereal, thus without form, and that it will be clothed again with the body, what is said by the internal about the nature of the soul 
will seem far removed from the truth; and it will be hard to those who believe that the body only is the man, when they hear that the soul is the man himself, and that the body which is buried is of 
no use in the other life. And yet that this is the truth, I know; for of the Lord's Divine mercy I have been with those who are in the other life-not with a few but with many, not once but often-and 
have talked with them about it. So also in numberless other cases. </p>

'Hard words to us' means that no joining together with this took place because no agreement existed. This is clear from the meaning of 'speaking hard words', when used to refer to the internal in relation 
to the external separated from it, as no joining together because no agreement existed, dealt with above in <a href="5422.htm">5422</a>, <a href="5423.htm">5423</a>. For if no agreement of the external with the internal exists, everything in 
the internal and coming from the internal seems 'hard' to the external, because the two are not joined together. Take for example a situation in which the internal, that is, someone living in his internal, 
declares that nothing at all of a person's thought begins in himself, but that his thought comes to him either from heaven (that is, from the Lord by way of heaven) or else from hell: he declares 
that any thought he has of good comes from the Lord by way of heaven, while any thought of evil comes from hell. Such an idea seems to be a thoroughly 'hard' one to anyone who wants what he thinks 
to come from himself and who believes that if that 'hard' idea is true, he is nothing. Yet that idea is absolutely true, and all in heaven perceive it to be so. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It is similarly the case when the 
internal, or those living in their internal, declare that the joy experienced by the angels originates in love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour, that is to say, when they are actually 
engaged in performing deeds of love and charity, and that those deeds hold within them so much joy and happiness that these are beyond description. This will come as a 'hard' idea to those whose joy springs 
solely from self-love and love of the world and who take no interest in their neighbour other than for their own selfish reasons. Yet heaven and heavenly joy start to exist in a person when self-regard 
vanishes from the useful deeds he performs.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Take as yet another example the situation in which the internal declares that a person's soul is nothing else than the internal man and that 
after death the internal man appears to be exactly the same person as lived in the world, having a similar face, similar body, similar sensory powers, and a similar power of thought. People who have 
entertained the idea that the soul exists only on the level where thought does and is for that reason something ethereal lacking any outward form, and that the soul is to be reclothed with its body, 
imagine that what is declared by the internal about the soul is very far from the truth. Indeed those who believe that there is nothing more than the body to a human being will find the idea 'hard' when 
they hear that the soul is the real person and that the body which is buried serves no use at all in the next life. I know this is true because I have in the Lord's Divine mercy gone among such people, 
not among just some but among many, not just once but often, and I have talked to them on this matter. The same may also be said about countless other matters. </p>

`Cum nobis dura': quod significet non conjunctionem cum illo ob non correspondentiam, constat ex significatione `loqui dura' cum praedicatur de interno respective ad externum a se  separatum, quod sit 
non conjunctio ob non correspondentiam, de qua supra n. 5422, 5423; si enim non correspondentia est externi cum interno, tunc omne id quod internum est et ab interno venit, externo apparet `durum', 
quia non est conjunctio; sicut pro exemplo: si dicatur ab interno, seu ab illo qui in interno est, quod homo nihil cogitet ex se, sed vel ex caelo hoc est, per caelum a Domino, vel ex inferno; si bonum 
cogitat {1} quod sit per caelum a Domino, si malum  quod sit ab inferno; hoc prorsus ut durum apparet ei qui vult ex se cogitare, et qui credit se tunc nihil esse; cum tamen verissimum est, et omnes 
qui in caelo, in perceptione sunt quod ita sit.  [2] Similiter si {2} dicatur ab interno,seu ab illis qui in interno sunt, quod gaudium in quo angeli, sit ex amore in Dominum et ex charitate erga proximum, 
nempe cum in usu sunt praestandi illa quae amoris et charitatis sunt, et quod in his tale gaudium et talis felicitas sit ut prorsus sit ineffabile; hoc durum erit illis qui solum in gaudio ex 
amore sui et mundi sunt, et in nullo proximi nisi propter se; cum tamen caelum et caeli gaudium tunc in homine incipit cum respectus sui in usibus quos facit, exspirat.  [3] Sit etiam hoc pro aliquo exemplo: 
si dicatur ab interno quod anima hominis nihil aliud sit quam internus homo, et quod internus homo post mortem appareat prorsus sicut homo in mundo, simili facie, simili corpore, simili facultate 
sensitiva, et simili cogitativa, qui foverunt opinionem de anima quod modo sit cogitativum quid, et sic quasi aethereum, ita absque forma, et quod illa reinduitura corpus {3}, illi alienum a vero 
putabunt esse quod anima sit talis, atque durum erit illis qui credunt quod corpus sit  modo homo, audire quod anima sit ipse homo, et quod corpus quod tumulatur, ad nihil conducat {4} in altera vita; 
quod id verum sit, scio, nam, ex Divina Domini misericordia, fueram cum illis, non cum aliquibus sed cum multis, non semel sed saepe, et locutus cum illis de eo.  Ita quoque in innumeris aliis. @1 cogitet$ @2
