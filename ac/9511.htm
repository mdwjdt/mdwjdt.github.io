<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9511节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9511.</strong>“安在施恩座的两头”表属天良善和属灵良善。这从这一头的“基路伯”和那一头的“基路伯”的含义清楚可知：这一头的“基路伯”是指通过属天良善接近；那一头的“基路伯”是指通过属灵良善接近。“两头”在此和主的左右所表相同。主的“右边”表示属天之爱的良善，就是对主之爱的良善；祂的“左边”是指属灵之爱的良善，就是对邻之爱的良善。也正因如此，人右边的一切事物皆对应于属天良善，左边的一切事物皆对应于属灵良善；因为人里面的一切事物皆对应于天堂。在马可福音，“坐在主的左右”就表示那些处于这些良善的人：<br />只是坐在我的左右，不是我可以赐的，乃是为谁预备的，就赐给谁。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.40.htm">10:40</a>）<br />“为谁预备的，就赐给谁”表示出于怜悯赐给那些在生活和信仰上处于良善的人（参看<a href="9305.htm">9305</a>节），因而赐给那些处于属天良善和属灵良善的人。</p>

At the two ends of the propitiatory [mercy seat]. That this signifies celestial good and spiritual good, is evident from the signification of the "cherub" at one end, as being the approach through celestial 
good; and from the signification of the "cherub" at the other end, as being the approach through spiritual good. The same is here signified by "the two ends" as by the Lord's right and left hands; 
by His "right hand" is signified the good of celestial love, which is the good of love to the Lord; and by His "left hand" the good of spiritual love, which is the good of love toward the neighbor. 
From this also all things on man's right side correspond to celestial good; and those on his left side to spiritual good; for all things with man correspond to heaven. Those who are in these goods 
are meant by "sitting on the Lord's right and left hands" in Mark: </p>
<p>     To sit on My right hand, and on My left hand, is not Mine to give; except to those for whom it hath been prepared (Mark 10:40); </p>
<p>"to 
give to those for whom it hath been prepared" signifies to bestow from mercy upon those who are in the good of life and of faith (see n. 9305), thus on those who are in celestial good and in spiritual good. </p>

'At the two ends of the mercy-seat' means celestial good and spiritual good. This is clear from the meaning of 'a cherub at one end' as access through celestial good; and from the meaning of 'a cherub 
at the other end' as access through spiritual good. The same thing is meant here by 'the two ends' as by the Lord's 'right' and 'left'. His 'right' means the good of celestial love, which is the good 
of love to the Lord, and His 'left' means the good of spiritual love, which is the good of love towards the neighbour. So it is also that everything in the right side of a person corresponds to celestial 
good, and everything in the left to spiritual good; for everything in the human being corresponds to heaven. People who are governed by those two kinds of good are meant by 'to sit on the Lord's 
right and left' in Mark,  </p>
<blockquote>
To sit at My right and at My left is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2010:40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 10:40</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Giving to those for whom it has been prepared' 
means granting it in mercy to those who are governed by good in life and faith, <a href="9305.htm">9305</a>, thus who are governed by celestial good and by spiritual good.  </p>

`A duabus extremitatibus propitiatorii': quod significet bonum caeleste et bonum spirituale, constat ex significatione `cherubi ab una extremitate' quod sit aditus (x)per bonum caeleste, et a significatione 
`cherubi ab altera extremitate' quod sit aditus per bonum spirituale; simile hic per duas extremitates significatur, quod per dextram et sinistram Domini; per dextram significatur bonum amoris 
caelestis, quod est bonum amoris in Dominum, et per sinistram {1} significatur bonum amoris spiritualis, quod est bonum amoris erga proximum; inde quoque omnia quae a dextra parte hominis correspondent 
bono caelesti, et quae a sinistra bono spirituali, nam omnia quae apud hominem correspondent caelo; illi qui in bonis illis sunt intelliguntur per `sedere a dextris et sinistris Domini' apud Marcum, 	Sedere 
ex dextris Meis et ex sinistris Meis non est Meum dare, sed quibus paratum est, x 40; </p>
<p>`dare illis quibus paratum est' significat donare illis ex misericordia, qui in bono vitae et fidei sunt, 
n. 9305, ita qui in bono caelesti et in bono spirituali. @1 i Domini$ </p>
