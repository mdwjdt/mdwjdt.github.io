<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第768节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>768.</strong>“挪亚”表属于该教会的一切，“闪、含、雅弗”表属于源自该教会的众教会的一切。这一点从以下事实清楚可知：此处他们没有象前面（7:7）那样被简单称为“他的儿子”，还加上了他们的名字。当以这种方式提及他们的名字时，他们表示这个教会的成员。该教会成员不但是教会本身，还是属于它的一切。这是一个包含“凡属教会的一切”的常用术语，如前面论及上古教会时，就称之为“亚当”（ Man）的情形，论及以名字提及的其他人时同样如此。因此，“挪亚”和“闪、含、雅弗”表示整个属于这个教会的一切，以及整个属于源自它的众教会的一切。<br />这是圣言的言说风格和方式。例如，当在先知书中提到犹大时，它大多表示属天的教会，或属于这个教会的一切；当提到以色列时，它大多表示属灵的教会，或属于这个教会的一切；当提及雅各时，它表示外在教会。因为教会的每个成员既有一个教会的内在，也有一个教会的外在。内在就是真教会可觅之处，而外在则是源自它的一切，就是雅各。<br />当以名字提及他们时，情况则不同。因为在这种情况下，他们以象征性的方式涉及主的王国。主是唯一的人（the only Man），是其王国的全部。由于教会是主在地上的国，故唯独主是教会的全部。教会的全部就是爱或仁，因此一个人或以名字被提及的某个人表示爱或仁，亦即教会的全部。在这种情况下，“妻子”仅简单地表示出自它的教会，如此处的情形。蒙主慈悲，“闪、含、雅弗”所表示的教会品质以后再予以讨论。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]768.</strong> The symbolism of Noah as qualities of the church and of Shem, Ham, and Japheth as qualities of the churches that developed out of that church can be seen from the fact that they are not called his sons here, as they were above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_768/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_7" target=_top>7</a>. Instead they are called by their names. When their names appear, they symbolize the people of the church. An individual in the church stands not only for the actual church but also for every trait that characterizes the church. The term person in the church is a comprehensive one embracing every attribute of religion, as was previously noted in connection with the earliest church, which was called "the human" [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_768/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_64" target=_top>64</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_768/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_339" target=_top>339</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_768/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_477" target=_top>477-479</a>]. The same is true of all other people whose names are given. So Noah and Shem, Ham, and Japheth symbolize all characteristics of the [new] church and of the churches that grew out of it — all such characteristics taken as a whole. This is the Word's style and manner of speaking.<br />[2] Where the prophets mention Judah by name, for instance, he usually symbolizes a church that is heavenly, or whatever characterizes such a church. Where Israel is named, he usually symbolizes a church that is spiritual, or whatever characterizes it. Where Jacob is named, he symbolizes the outer church, because in every religious person, the church has an inner aspect and an outer. The inner aspect is where the true church resides, and the outer aspect is what comes out of it; this latter is Jacob.<br />The situation is different when these people are not mentioned by name.<br />[3] The reason why this is the case is that when people are named, they call the Lord's kingdom to mind by representing it. The Lord is the only human, and he is the totality of his kingdom. Since the church is the Lord's kingdom on earth, the Lord alone is also the totality of the church.<br />The all-in-all of the church is love, or charity, so a human being (or, what is the same, a person mentioned by name) symbolizes love or charity — that is, the totality of the church. The person's wife then symbolizes simply the church composed of those qualities, as the wives here do.{*1} What kind of churches Shem, Ham, and Japheth symbolize will be explained below, with the Lord's divine mercy.{*2} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg's reference to a "person's" wife recalls his use of similar phrasing at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_768/bible_king-james-version_genesis_2_18-25" target=_top>Genesis 2:18-25</a> and in his discussion of those verses in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_768/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_131" target=_top>131-167</a>, where he describes Adam, like Noah here, as standing for people in general, male and female. [LHC]<br />{*2} On the churches symbolized by Shem, Ham, and Japheth, see, for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_768/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_975" target=_top>975</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_768/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1062" target=_top>1062</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_768/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1083" target=_top>1083</a>.

That by "Noah" is signified what was of the church, and by "Shem, Ham, and Japheth" what pertained to the churches that were derived therefrom, is evident from the fact that here they were not called 
merely his "sons" as before in the seventh verse, but are called by their names. When thus named they signify the man of the church. The man of the church is not merely the church itself, but is everything 
that belongs to the church. It is a general term comprehending whatever is of the church, as was said before of the Most Ancient Church, which was called "Man" and likewise of the other churches 
that were named. Thus by "Noah" and by "Shem, Ham, and Japheth" is signified whatever is of the church and of the churches that were derived from it, in one complex.  [2] Such is the style and manner 
of speaking in the Word. Thus where "Judah" is named, in the Prophets, the celestial church is mostly signified, or whatever is of that church; where "Israel" is named, the spiritual church is mostly 
signified, or whatever is of that church; where "Jacob" is named, the external church is signified; for with every man of the church there is an internal and an external of the church, the internal 
being where the true church is, and the external being what is derived therefrom, and this latter is "Jacob."  [3] But the case is different when the men are not named. The reason why this is so is 
that when named they refer representatively to the kingdom of the Lord. The Lord is the only Man, and is the all of His kingdom; and as the church is His kingdom on earth, the Lord alone is the all of 
the church. The all of the church is love or charity; and therefore a man (or what is the same, one called by name), signifies love or charity, that is, the all of the church; and then his "wife" signifies 
simply the church thence derived. So it is here. But what kind of churches are signified by "Shem, Ham, and Japheth" will of the Lord's Divine mercy be stated hereafter. </p>

'Noah' means what belonged to that Church, and 'Shem, Ham, and Japheth' what belonged to the Churches that derived from it. This is clear from the fact that here they are not called simply 'his sons', 
as they were previously in verse 7, but that their names are added as well. When their names are mentioned in this way they mean the member of the Church. The member of the Church is not only the Church 
itself, but also everything belonging to it. It is a general term embracing whatever belongs to the Church, as stated already in reference to the Most Ancient Church which was called Man, and likewise 
in reference to the others mentioned by name. 'Noah' therefore and 'Shem, Ham, and Japheth' mean whatever belongs in its entirety to the Church and to the Churches deriving from it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Such 
is the style and manner of expression used in the Word. For example, when Judah is mentioned in the Prophets it means in most cases the celestial Church or whatever belongs to that Church. When Israel 
is mentioned it means in most cases the spiritual Church or whatever belongs to that Church. And when it is Jacob it means the external Church. For with every member of the Church there exist the internal 
aspect of the Church and the external. The internal is where the true Church is to be found, while the external is what derives from it, which is Jacob.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 It is different when they are not 
mentioned by name, for the reason that in that case they relate to the Lord's kingdom in a representative fashion. The Lord is the only Man, and is the All of His kingdom. And because the Church is the 
Lord's kingdom on earth, the Lord alone is the All of the Church. The All of the Church is love or charity, and therefore 'man', or what amounts to the same, someone who is mentioned by name means 
love or charity, that is, the All of the Church. 'Wife' in that case means quite simply the Church that comes from it, as is also the case here. The character of the Churches meant by 'Shem, Ham, and 
Japheth' however will in the Lord's Divine mercy be discussed later on. </p>

Quod per 'Noahum' significetur quod finit Ecclesiae, et per 'Shem, Ham et Japheth' quod fuit Ecclesiarum inde, constat ex eo quod hic non 'filii ejus,' ut prius vers. 7, sed ipsi quoad nomina, dicantur; 
cum nominantur ita, significant hominem Ecclesiae; homo Ecclesiae non solum est ipsa Ecclesia, sed omne Ecclesiae; est vox communis comprehendens quicquid est Ecclesiae, sicut prius dictum de Antiquissima 
Ecclesia, quae dicta finit Homo, similiter de ceteris qui nominati sunt; ita per 'Noahum' et per 'Shem, Ham et Japheth' significatur quicquid est Ecclesiae, et Ecclesiarum inde, in uno complexu; 
[2] talis est stilus et modus loquendi in Verbo; sicut ubi nominatur (x)'Juda,' significatur apud Prophetas plurimum Ecclesia caelestis, seu quicquid est Ecclesiae; ubi nominatur 'Israel,' significatur 
plurimum Ecclesia spiritualis, seu quicquid est Ecclesiae illius; ubi 'Jacob,' significatur Ecclesia externa; nam apud unumquemvis hominem Ecclesiae datur internum Ecclesiae et externum; internum 
est ubi vera Ecclesia, externum est quod inde, id est 'Jacob': aliter cum non nominantur: [3] causa quod ita sit, est quod se referant tunc ad regnum Domini repraesentative; Dominus est solus Homo 
et est omne regni Sui; et quia Ecclesia est regnum Domini in terris, est Dominus solus omne Ecclesiae: omne Ecclesiae est amor seu charitas, quare 'homo,' seu quod idem, nomine nominatus, significat amorem 
seu charitatem, hoc est, omne Ecclesiae; et tunc 'uxor' simpliciter Ecclesiam quae inde; ut quoque hic. Sed quales Ecclesiae significantur per 'Shem, Ham et Japheth,' in sequentibus, ex Divina Domini 
Misericordia, dicetur. </p>
