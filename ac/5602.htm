<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5602节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5602.</strong>“焉能知道他要说，必须把你们的兄弟带下来呢”表我们不相信他想要那良善之真理与他联结。这从“焉能知道他要说”的含义和便雅悯的代表清楚可知：“焉能知道他要说”是指不相信；便雅悯，即此处的“兄弟”，是指良善之真理，如刚才所述（<a href="5600.htm">5600</a>节）。他们“必须把兄弟带下来”表示这良善之真理要与来自内在的属灵层联结，这从前面所述明显可知（<a href="5596.htm">5596</a>节）。</p>

Knowing could we know that he would say, Bring your brother down? That this signifies that we did not believe that he desired the truth of good to be conjoined with himself, is evident from the signification 
of "knowing could we know that he would say," as being not to believe; and from the representation of Benjamin, who is here the "brother," as being the truth of good (of which just above, n. 
5600). That this was to be conjoined with him is signified by their "bringing him down," as is plain from what was said above (n. 5596). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5602</b></p><p><b>5602.</b>
'Could We possibly have known that he would say, Cause your brother to come down?' means that we did not believe that he would want the truth of good to be joined to him. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'could it possibly be known that he would say?' as not believing; and from the representation of Benjamin, to whom 'brother' refers here, as the truth of good, dealt with just above in <a href="5600.htm">5600</a>. The 
joining of this truth of good to the spiritual from the internal is meant by the command that they should cause him to come down, as is evident from what has been stated above in <a href="5596.htm">5596</a>. </p>

</p><b>5602.</b>
`An sciendo scivimus quod diceret, Descendere facite fratrem vestrum?': quod significet quod non credidimus {2}quod vellet ut ipsi conjungeretur verum boni, constat (c)a significatione `an sciendo scire 
quod diceret' quod sit non credere; et ex repraesentatione `Benjaminis' qui hic est `frater', quod sit verum boni, de qua mox supra n. 5600; quod hoc illi conjungeretur, significatur per quod `descendere 
facerent', ut patet ab illis quae supra n. 5596 dicta sunt. @1 A I o, but see 5594.$ </p>
