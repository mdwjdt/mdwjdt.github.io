<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第662节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>662．“凡地上所有的都要断气” 表示那些属于这个教会，并已变得如此之人。这一点可从以下事实清楚看出来：“地”不是指全世界的每一块陆地，而仅指那些属于教会的人，如前所述。因此，这里不是说任何洪水，更不是说全世界的大洪水，而是指存在于那里之人的死亡或窒息，因为此时他们脱离了余留，由此脱离了属于真理的觉知之物和属于良善的意愿之物，因而脱离了天堂。“地”表示教会所在的区域。因此表示生活在那里的人，这一点除了前面引用的经文外，还可从以下圣言经文得以证实。如耶利米书：<br />耶和华如此说，全地必然荒凉，我却不毁灭净尽。因此，地要悲哀，在上的天也必黑暗。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.27.htm">4:27</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.28.htm">28</a>）<br />“地”表示生活在教会所在之地的人们，该教会已经荒凉。以赛亚书：<br />我必使天震动，使地摇撼，离其本位。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.13.htm">13:13</a>）<br />“地”表示居于已荒凉的教会所在之地的人类。耶利米书：<br />到那日，从这一地极直到那一地极，都有耶和华所杀戮的。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.33.htm">25:33</a>）<br />“地极”不是指全世界的每一块陆地，仅指教会所在的区域，因此是仅指教会成员所在之地。同一先知书：<br />我要命刀剑临到地上一切的居民。必有响声达到地极，因为耶和华与列国相争。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.29.htm">25:29</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.31.htm">31</a>）<br />这里也不是说整个世界，仅指教会所在的区域，因此仅指教会成员或居民所在之地。“列国”表虚假。以赛亚书：<br />看哪，耶和华从他的居所出来，要刑罚地上居民的罪孽。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛26.21.htm">26:21</a>）<br />这里表示的意思一样。同一先知书：<br />你们岂不曾听见吗？从起初岂没有人告诉你们吗？自从立地的根基，你们岂没有明白吗？（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.21.htm">40:21</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />创造诸天的耶和华，制造成全大地的神，他创造坚定大地。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.18.htm">45:18</a>）<br />“地”表教会成员。撒迦利亚书：<br />铺张诸天，建立地基，造人里面之灵的耶和华说。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚12.1.htm">12:1</a>）<br />“地”显然表示教会成员。地不同于土地，就象教会成员不同于教会本身，或爱与信不同一样。</p>

Cooper(2008,2013)</b></p>
<p><strong>[NCE]662.</strong> All that is on the earth will pass away symbolizes the people who were part of that church and who adopted its nature. As demonstrated earlier [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_662/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566" target=_top>566-567</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_662/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_620" target=_top>620</a>], the earth does not mean the whole inhabited world, only the part that constituted the church. So the verse is not referring to any kind of flood, let alone a worldwide one. It is talking about the death, the "drowning," of those in the church who were cut off from the remnant within them and consequently from any comprehension of truth or will to do good; which is to say that they were cut off from the heavens.<br />Scriptural passages quoted earlier attest to the symbolism of the earth or land as the area where the church existed, and so as the inhabitants of that area.{*1} The following verses also confirm the symbolism. In Jeremiah:<br />This is what Jehovah has said: "The whole earth will be stripped bare, yet I will not make a full end. Because of this the earth will mourn and the heavens above will be draped in black." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_662/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_4_27-28" target=_top>Jeremiah 4:27-28</a>)<br />The earth stands for residents in the area where the church, which had been devastated, existed. In Isaiah:<br />I will shake heaven, and the earth will quake out of its place. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_662/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_13_13" target=_top>Isaiah 13:13</a>)<br />The earth here stands for an individual in the church's territory who is to suffer devastating experiences. In Jeremiah:<br />The people stabbed by Jehovah will on that day reach from the ends of the earth to the ends of the earth. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_662/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_25_33" target=_top>Jeremiah 25:33</a>)<br />The ends of the earth here do not mean the entire globe but only the tract of land where the church was. So they symbolize the people who belonged to the church. In the same author:<br />I am calling for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the land. Upheaval has come all the way to the ends of the earth, because Jehovah has a quarrel against the nations. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_662/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_25_29" target=_top>Jeremiah 25:29</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_662/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_25_31" target=_top>31</a>)<br />Again it is not the whole globe that is meant but only the territory of the church and so the inhabitant there, that is, a person who belongs to the church. In this passage the nations stand for falsities. In Isaiah:<br />Watch: Jehovah is leaving his place to exact punishment for wickedness in the inhabitant of the land. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_662/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_26_21" target=_top>Isaiah 26:21</a>)<br />The meaning here is similar. In the same author:<br />Are you not listening? Has it not been pointed out to you from the beginning? Do you not understand the foundations of the earth? (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_662/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_40_21" target=_top>Isaiah 40:21</a>)<br />In the same author:<br />Jehovah is creating the heavens; he is God, forming the earth and making it; he is also establishing it. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_662/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_45_18" target=_top>Isaiah 45:18</a>)<br />The earth stands for a member of the church. In Zechariah:<br />This is the saying of Jehovah as he stretches out the heavens and founds the earth and forms the human spirit in the middle of it. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_662/bible_king-james-version_zechariah_12_1" target=_top>Zechariah 12:1</a>)<br />Plainly the earth stands for a person in the church.<br />The earth (or land) is distinguished from the ground, just as a person in the church is distinguished from the church itself, or as love is distinguished from faith.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Sections 620, 636 do suggest that "earth" (or "land") symbolizes the people who live in a given area, but the most detailed treatment, in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_662/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566" target=_top>566</a>, uses Scripture to demonstrate that "earth" or "land" often symbolizes areas where the church does not exist, and that a third term, "ground," symbolizes the church's territory. See also note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_662/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566" target=_top>566</a>. [LHC] </p>

Everything that is in the earth shall expire. This signifies those who were of that church and had become of this quality. It has been shown before that the "earth" does not mean the whole world, but 
only those who were of the church. Thus no deluge was meant here, still less a universal deluge, but the expiring or suffocation of those who existed there, when they were separated from remains, and 
thereby from the things of the understanding that are of truth and the things of the will that are of good, and therefore from the heavens. That the "earth" signifies the region where the church is, 
and therefore those who live there, may be confirmed by the following passages from the Word, in addition to those already cited. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Thus hath said Jehovah, The whole earth shall be desolate; 
yet will I not make a consummation. For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above shall be black (Jer. 4:27-28). Here the "earth" denotes those who dwell where the church is that is vastated. 
In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     I will move the heavens, and the earth shall be shaken out of her place (Isa. 13:13). The "earth" denotes the man who is to be vastated, where the church is. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p> 
    The slain of Jehovah shall be at that day from the end of the earth even unto the end of the earth (Jer. 25:33).Here the "end of the earth" does not signify the whole world, but only the region where 
the church was, and consequently the men who were of the church. Again: </p>
<p>     I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth; a tumult shall come even to the end of the earth; for Jehovah 
hath a controversy with the nations (Jer. 25:29, 31). In this passage, in like manner, the whole world is not meant, but only the region where the church is, and therefore the inhabitant or man 
of the church; the "nations" here denote falsities. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Behold, Jehovah cometh forth out of His place to visit the iniquity of the inhabitant of the earth (Isa. 26:21). Here the meaning 
is the same. Again: </p>
<p>     Have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood the foundations of the earth (Isa. 40:21)? Again: </p>
<p>     Jehovah, that createth the 
heavens, God Himself that formeth the earth and maketh it, He establisheth it (Isa. 45:18). The "earth" denotes the man of the church. In Zechariah: </p>
<p>     The saying of Jehovah, who stretcheth out the 
heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man in the midst of him (Zech. 12:1), where the "earth" manifestly denotes the man of the church. The "earth" is distinguished 
from the "ground" as are the man of the church and the church itself, or as are love and faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 662</b></p><p><b>662.</b>
'Everything that is on the earth will breathe its last' means those belonging to that Church who became such. This becomes clear from the fact that 'the earth' does not mean every land throughout the 
world but only those people who belonged to the Church, as shown already. No flood of any kind is meant here therefore, let alone a flooding of the whole world, but instead the decease or choking to 
death of those people there who when cut off from remnants, and so from things connected with the understanding of truth and with the will for good, were consequently cut off from the heavens. In addition 
to places already quoted from the Word, let the following also serve to confirm the fact that 'earth' means that area where the Church is, and therefore those who are there. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus 
said Jehovah, The whole earth will be desolate, yet I will not bring it to a close. For this the earth will mourn, and the heavens above be black. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%204:27,%2028&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 4:27, 28</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the earth' stands for people 
living where the Church is that has been vastated. In Isaiah, I will jolt heaven, and the earth will be shaken out of its place. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2013:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 13:13</a>. </p>
<p>'Earth' stands for mankind which is to be vastated where 
the Church is. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The slain<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of Jehovah on that day will be from one end of the earth to the other end of the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2025:33&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 25:33</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the end of the earth' does not mean every land 
throughout the world, only that area where the Church was, and consequently where members of the Church were. In the same prophet, I am summoning a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth. A clamour 
is coming even to the end of the earth, for Jehovah's controversy is against the nations. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2025:29,%2031&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 25:29, 31</a>. Nor is the whole world meant here, only the area where the Church is, and consequently 
where the inhabitant or member of the Church is. 'The nations' here stands for falsities. In Isaiah, Behold, Jehovah is coming out of His place to visit the iniquity of the inhabitant of the earth. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2026:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 26:21</a>.  </p>
<p>Here the meaning is similar. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Do you not hear? Has it not been pointed out to you from the beginning? Do you not understand the foundations of the earth? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2040:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 40:21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In 
the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah who creates the heavens, the God who forms the earth and makes it, the Same establishes it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2045:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 45:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Earth' stands for the member of the Church. In Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
The 
Word of Jehovah who stretches out the heavens, and founds the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%2012:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 12:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p> 'The earth' obviously stands for the member of the Church. The 
earth is different from the ground in the way that the member of the Church is different from the Church itself, or as love and faith are different.
