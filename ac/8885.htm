<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8885节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8885.</strong>“当记念”表永远存在于思维中的东西。这从“记念”的含义清楚可知，“记念”当论及绝不可忘记的那种事时，是指永远存在于思维中的东西。永远存在于思维中的东西就是在那里普遍掌权的东西；永远存在于一个人思维里的东西在他那里掌权，甚至当他正在沉思其它事或忙于工作的时候也是。人的思维包含许多彼此共存的事物，因为它是由许多按连续阶段进入的事物所产生的形式。可清楚觉知的事物当时在中间，因而在内视所拥有的光中，而这时其它一切事物则在四周。在周围部分的事物处于模糊之中，不是清晰可见的，除非当与它们有关的各种事物突然出现的时候。但更边远，不在同一层面上，而是向下倾斜的事物则是一个人已经丢弃并厌恶的那类事物。对善人来说，这类事物是邪恶和虚假；对恶人来说，则是良善和真理。<br />一个人的思维里面有永远在那里的事物，也就是在那里普遍掌权的事物；这些是他最内在的事物。人从这些事物那里视那些不永远在思维里的其它事物，也就是尚未普遍掌权的其它事物为在自己之外，以及在自己之下，与他尚不相关。这时，他从其它事物那里选择那些与最内在的事物相一致的事物，并将其与自己相关联；当这些事物与最内在的事物相关联，并最终与它们结合时，最内在的事物，也就是那些普遍掌权的事物就变得更加强大。对善人来说，这一切通过新的真理实现；对恶人来说，这一切则通过新的虚假，或对真理的错误使用实现。<br />要进一步知道，普遍掌权的东西就是那已经被灌输到意愿本身中的东西，意愿本身是人的最内在部分，因为意愿是由他的爱形成的。事实上，无论一个人爱什么，那都是他的意愿；他爱之胜过一切的东西，他会最深处进行意愿。然而，理解力有助于向别人清楚显明一个人所意愿，也就是所爱的东西。不过，它也有助于扭曲别人的意愿；这个人会利用各种业已形成的观念使别人的意愿服从他自己的意愿。当这种情况发生时，爱或情感也从意愿流入理解力中的观念，并通过一种灵感将生命和活动注入它们。<br />对善人来说，理解力中的这些观念与属于意愿的情感合而为一；但对恶人来说则不然。对他们来说，思维和意愿从至内在的确是一致的，因为意愿所渴望的邪恶，理解力以与该邪恶相一致的虚假的形式来进行思考。不过，这种一致性并未显明给世人，因为恶人从孩童时就开始学习说一套，想一套，行一套，意愿一套。简言之，他们学会了将其内层人与外层人分离，并在外层人中形成或发展出除了内层人中的东西之外的另一个意愿，以及另一个思维，从而通过外层人去伪装与内层人完全相反的良善，因为就在这同一时刻，内层人却在意愿邪恶，而且在不知不觉中思想这邪恶。但在来世，内层意愿和思维的性质却如同在光天化日之下那样显而易见；因为在来世，外在事物都被移走，内在事物则裸露出来。</p>

Remember. That this signifies what is perpetual in the thought, is evident from the signification of "remembering," when said of such a thing as must not in any wise be forgotten, as being what is perpetual 
in the thought. That is perpetual in the thought which universally reigns there; and that universally reigns with man which is perpetually in his thought, even when he is meditating on other things, 
or is engaged in business affairs. The thought of man involves many things together, for it is the form of many things which have entered successively. Those things which come to manifest perception 
are at the time in the midst, and thus in the light of the internal sight, while all other things are then at the sides round about. Those which are in the circuits are in obscurity, and are not 
manifested except when such objects occur as they are associated with. But the things which are still more remote, and are not on the same plane, but tend downward, are such as the man has rejected and 
holds in aversion. Such things are evils and falsities with the good, and goods and truths with the evil. [2] In the very thought of man are those things which are perpetually there, that is, which 
universally reign there, which are his inmost things. From these man regards those things which are not perpetually there (that is, those things which do not yet universally reign) as being outside 
of himself, and also as beneath himself, and as not yet being akin to him; from which he can then choose and adjoin to himself those things which agree with the inmost things, and from the adjunction 
and final consociation of which, the inmost things, that is, those which universally reign, are strengthened. This is effected by means of new truths with the good, and by means of new falsities, or by 
wrong applications of truths, with the evil. [3] Be it known further that that which universally reigns is that which has been insinuated into the will itself, for the will itself is the inmost of 
man, because it has been formed from his love. For whatever man loves, this he wills, and that which he loves above all things, this he inmostly wills. But the understanding serves to make manifest before 
others the things which the man wills, that is, which he loves; and serves also to bend the wills of others by ideas variously formed for accommodation thereto. When this is the case, love or affection 
flows from the will into the intellectual ideas also, and by a certain kind of inspiration vivifies and moves them. [4] With the good these intellectual ideas make a one with the affections which 
are of the will; but it is otherwise with the evil, for with these the thought and the will do indeed inmostly agree, because the evil which the will wills, the understanding thinks, as falsity that 
is in agreement with this evil; but this agreement does not appear before men in the world, because from their infancy the evil learn to speak differently from what they think, and to act differently 
from what they will; in a word, they learn to separate their interior man from their exterior, and in this latter to form another will and also another thought besides that which is in their interior 
man, and thus by the exterior man to counterfeit good that is quite contrary to the interior man, which at the same instant wills evil and also imperceptibly thinks it. But in the other life the quality 
of the interior will and thought is manifest as in clear light, for in that life external things are removed, and internal things are laid bare. </p>

'Remember' means what is perpetually in the thoughts. This is clear from the meaning of 'remembering', when said in connection with the kind of thing which must by no means be forgotten, as what is perpetually 
in the power of thought What is perpetually in the thoughts is that which reigns universally there; and that reigns universally with a person which is present perpetually in his thoughts, even 
when his mind is on other things or he is occupied with his work. A person's thoughts contain a number of things existing together with one another, for it is the form produced by a number of things 
which have entered in successive stages. The ones which are clearly perceptible lie in the middle then and so are in the light that inner sight possesses, while the remainder then are to the sides 
round about. Those which lie in the surrounding parts are in obscurity and are not plainly visible, except when the kinds of matters which they have been connected with crop up. But those which are even 
more outlying, and are not on the same level but slope away downwards, are the kinds of things which a person has thrown aside and which he detests. The latter are evils and falsities in the case of 
people who are good, and forms of good and truths in the case of those who are bad. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Within a person's thoughts there are things which are there perpetually, that is, they reign universally there; 
these are his inmost things. From them the person regards others which are not perpetually there, that is, are not yet reigning universally, as being outside himself, and also as beneath himself 
and not as yet related to him. From these others he can at that time choose and link to himself ones which accord with the inmost; and when they have been linked to and at length combined with them, the 
inmost, that is, those reigning universally, are made stronger. This is done by means of new truths in the case of those who are good, and by means of new falsities, or by wrong application of truths, 
in the case of those who are bad. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 It should be recognized in addition that that which reigns universally is whatever has been instilled into the actual will, which is the inmost part of a person 
because it has been formed from his love. For whatever a person loves, that is what he wills; and what he loves above all he wills in his inmost being. The understanding however serves to make plain 
to others the things a person wills, that is, loves. But also it serves to bend other people's wills; the person uses ideas formulated in various ways to make their wills comply with his own. When 
this happens love or affection also passes from the will into ideas in the understanding, and by means of a kind of inspiration breathes life and movement into them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the case of people who 
are good those ideas in the understanding make one with affections belonging to the will. But in the case of people who are bad it is different. With them thought and will inmostly do indeed accord with 
each other; for the evil desired by the will occupies the understanding in the form of falsity according with that evil. But this agreement is not evident to people in the world; for they learn from 
earliest childhood to speak other than they think, and to do other than they will In short they learn to separate their inner man from their outer man, to develop in the latter a will and also thought 
other than what is in the inner man, and so by means of their outer man to feign good that is altogether out of keeping with their inner man, which in the same instant desires evil and also imperceptibly 
is thinking it. But what the inner will and thought are like is evident in the next life, as in broad daylight; for there externals are taken away and internals are laid bare. </p>

`Recordare': quod significet perpetuum in cogitatione, constat ex significatione `recordari' cum dicitur de tali quod nequaquam obliviscendum (c)est, quod sit perpetuum in cogitatione; perpetuum in 
cogitatione est quod universaliter ibi regnat, et id universaliter regnat (o)apud hominem quod perpetuo inest cogitationi ejus {1}, etiam cum de aliis rebus meditatur aut in negotiis est; cogitatio hominis 
volvit simul plura, nam est forma plurium quae successive intraverunt; quae ad manifestam perceptionem veniunt, (x)illa sunt tunc in medio et sic in luce visus interni, ac reliqua tunc sunt ad latera 
circumcirca; quae in circuitibus sunt in obscuro sunt, nec manifestantur nisi (d)cum {2} objecta talia occurrunt cum quibus consociata sunt; quae autem adhuc remotiora sunt et non sunt in plano 
ibi sed vergunt deorsum, illa sunt talia quae homo rejecit et quae aversatur; talia sunt mala et falsa apud bonos ac bona et vera apud malos; [2] in ipsa cogitatione hominis sunt quae perpetuo ibi sunt, 
hoc est, quae universaliter ibi regnant, quae sunt intima ejus; ab his homo spectat illa quae non perpetuo ibi sunt, hoc est, illa quae nondum universaliter regnant, sicut extra se, et quoque sicut 
infra se, et sicut nondum affinia, ex quibus tunc potest eligere et sibi adjungere illa quae cum intimis conveniunt, ex quibus adjunctis et tandem consociatis intima, hoc est, universaliter regnantia 
corroborantur; hoc {3} fit per nova vera apud bonos, (c)ac per nova falsa, aut per applicationes sinistras verorum, apud malos. 	[3] Porro sciendum quod id quod universaliter regnat sit quod insinuatum 
est ipsi voluntati, nam ipsa voluntas est intimum hominis, quia illa formata est ex amore ejus, quicquid enim homo amat, hoc vult, et quod supra omnia amat, hoc intime vult; intellectus autem inservit 
ad manifestandum illa quae homo vult, hoc est, quae amat, coram aliis, et quoque inservit ad flectendum aliorum voluntates per ideas varie formatas ad condescendentiam; cum hoc fit, etiam ex voluntate 
influit amor seu affectio in ideas intellectuales, ac per quandam speciem inspirationis vivificat et movet; [4] ideae illae intellectuales apud bonos cum affectionibus, quae voluntatis, unum faciunt; 
apud malos autem aliter, nam apud hos cogitatio et voluntas intime quidem conveniunt, nam malum quod voluntas vult, hoc intellectus cogitat ut falsum malo conveniens {4}; (o)sed (m)hic consensus 
(o)non patet coram hominibus {5} in mundo, nam ab infantia discunt aliud loqui quam cogitant, et aliud facere quam volunt; verbo, discunt interiorem suum hominem separare ab exteriore, et in hoc formare 
aliam voluntatem et quoque aliam cogitationem quam quae est in interiore et sic per exteriorem mentiri bonum prorsus contra interiorem, qui eodem instanti malum {6} vult, et quoque imperceptibiliter 
cogitat; sed qualis est voluntas et cogitatio interior {7},(n) patet in altera vita ut in clara luce, nam ibi auferuntur externa et denudantur interna. @1 hominis$ @2 i ut$ @3 quae non universaliter 
ibi regnant, sicut infra se, ex quibus potest eligere illa quae recipi queunt, et consociari intimo, hoc est, illa quae universaliter regnant, haec inde corroborantur, quod$ @4 et quod intime vult, 
hoc supra omnia amat; intellectus autem inservit ad manifestandum coram aliis, quid amat, hoc est, quid vult, et quoque ad flectendum aliorum voluntates per intellectuales ideas varie formatas ad 
condescendentiam, quum hoc fit, etiam in ipsas ideas intellectuales influit amor seu affectio ex voluntate, quae inspirat et movet; apud illos qui boni sunt, intellectuales ideae non sunt nisi quam formae 
voluntatis, ita unum, at apud illos qui mali sunt, prorsus aliter, apud hos non unum sunt, sed bina, quia aliud vult homo, et aliud cogitat, quando loquitur et agit coram aliis, at coram se cogitat 
sicut vult, haec apud malos sunt mala, (m)intime quidem convenit apud illos cogitatio et voluntas, sed quod intellectus cogitat est falsum malo conveniens verum(n)$ @5 i cum$ @6 momento$ @7 i hominis$ </p>
