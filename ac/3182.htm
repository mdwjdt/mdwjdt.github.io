<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3182节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3182.</strong>“于是，他们打发妹子利百加”表与神圣真理的情感分离。这从“打发”的含义和“妹子利百加”的代表清楚可知：“打发”是指分离；“妹子利百加”是指对真理的情感（参看<a href="3077.htm">3077</a>，<a href="3179.htm">3179</a>节），“妹子”表真理（参看<a href="1495.htm">1495</a>，<a href="2508.htm">2508</a>，<a href="2524.htm">2524</a>，<a href="2556.htm">2556</a>，<a href="3160.htm">3160</a>节）。从前面的阐述和说明可以看出此中是何情形，但为了使这个问题更清楚，有必要作进一步的简要说明。当要被引入良善并与其联结的真理从属世人中被提升上来时，它便与属世人中的事物分离；这种分离就是“他们打发妹子利百加”所表示的。当此人不再通过真理关注良善，而是通过良善关注真理，或也可说，不再通过教义关注生活，而是通过生活关注教义时，这种分离便发生了。例如，教义教导这一真理：不可恨人，因为凡恨人的，每时每刻都在残杀他。早年人几乎不承认这是真理，随着年龄渐长、经历改造，他便将其列为当照之生活的教义之一，最后照这真理生活。这时，他不再通过教义思考，而是通过生活行动。当出现这种情况时，该教义真理就从属世人中被提升上来，事实上，与属世人分离，并被植入在理性的良善中。一旦这一切成就，他便不再允许属世人利用诡辩术对它发出质疑，甚至根本不允许属世人推理反对它。 </p>

They sent away Rebekah their sister. That this signifies separation from the affection of Divine truth, is evident from the signification of "sending," as denoting to be separated; and from the representation 
of Rebekah the sister, as being the affection of Divine truth (see n. 3077, 3179; that "sister" is truth may be seen above, n. 1495, 2508, 2524, 2556, 3160). How the case herein is, may be seen 
from what has been said and shown above in this chapter; but to make the matter plainer, a few words more shall be said. When the truth which is to be initiated and conjoined with good is elevated 
out of the natural, it is separated from what is therein; and this separation is what is signified by their sending away Rebekah their sister. Truth is separated when the man no longer from truth regards 
good, but from good truth; or what is the same, when he no longer from doctrine regards life, but from life doctrine. For example: doctrine teaches the truth that no one is to be held in hatred; 
for whoever holds another in hatred, kills him every moment. In early life a man scarcely admits the truth of this, but as he advances in age and is being reformed, he accounts this as one of the doctrinal 
things according to which he ought to live. At last he lives according to it; and then he no longer thinks from the doctrine, but acts from the life. When this is the case, this truth of doctrine 
is elevated out of the natural, and indeed is separated from the natural and implanted in good in the rational; and this being effected he no longer suffers the natural man by any of its sophistry to 
call it in doubt; nay, he does not suffer the natural man to reason against it. </p>

'They sent away Rebekah their sister' means separation from the affection for Divine truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'sending away' as being separated, and from the representation of 'Rebekah 
their sister' as the affection for Divine truth, dealt with above in <a href="3077.htm">3077</a>, <a href="3179.htm">3179</a> - 'a sister' meaning truth, see <a href="1495.htm">1495</a>, <a href="2508.htm">2508</a>, <a href="2524.htm">2524</a>, <a href="2556.htm">2556</a>, <a href="3160.htm">3160</a>. What is implied here may be seen from what has been stated 
and shown above in this chapter; yet to make it even clearer let a further brief comment be made about it. When truth that is to be introduced and joined to good is raised up from the natural it is 
separated from things present in the natural. That separation is what is meant by 'they sent away Rebekah their sister'. The separation takes place when the person looks no longer from truth to good 
but from good to truth, or what amounts to the same, when he looks no longer from doctrine to life but from life to doctrine - as the following example shows: Doctrine teaches the truth that no one is 
to be hated, for anyone who hates another slays him every moment. In his earliest years a person scarcely recognizes this, but as he grows older, if he is being reformed he places it among those matters 
of doctrine which ought to be matters of life. At length he lives according to that truth, in which case he no longer thinks from doctrine but acts from life. When that happens this truth of doctrine 
is raised up from the natural, indeed it is separated from the natural, and is implanted within good in the rational. Once this has happened he no longer permits the natural man to voice any doubt 
about it by means of any captious argument existing there; indeed he does not allow the natural man to reason against it at all. </p>

`Miserunt Rebeccam sororem suam': quod significet separationem ab affectione veri Divini, constat a significatione `mittere' quod sit separari, et a repraesentatione `Rebeccae sororis' quod sit affectio 
veri Divini, de qua supra n. 3177, 3179; quod `soror' sit verum, videatur n. 1495, 2508, 2524, 2556, 3160. Quomodo se res habet, constare potest (c)ab illis, quae supra in hoc capite dicta et ostensa 
sunt; ut autem melius pateant, adhuc paucis dicendum: cum verum quod initiandum et conjungendum bono, elevatur e naturali, tunc separatur ab illis quae ibi sunt; separatio illa est quae significatur 
per quod `miserunt Rebeccam sororem suam'; separatur tunc cum homo non amplius ex vero spectat bonum, sed ex bono verum, seu quod idem, cum non amplius ex doctrina vitam, sed ex vita doctrinam; ut 
pro exemplo: doctrina docet hoc verum quod non aliquis odio habendus, nam qui aliquem odio habet, illum quovis momento occidit; homo prima sua aetate vix hoc admittit; progrediente autem, cum reformatur, 
inter doctrinalia secundum quae vivendum, refert; tandem vivit secundum illud, tunc non amplius ex doctrinali cogitat, sed (c)ex vita agit; hoc cum fit, doctrinae hoc verum elevatum est e naturali, 
immo separatum a naturali, ac implantatum bono in rationali; quo facto, non amplius patitur ut naturalis homo per aliquod apud se sophisticum, id in dubium vocet, immo nec sinit ut contra illud ratiocinetur. </p>
