<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10266节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10266</strong>.前文膏油的预备用来描述在主之神性人身里面的主之神性之爱的神性良善，在相对意义上则用来描述来自主、与一个人同在的爱之良善。事实上，在圣言中，在至高意义上论及主的话在相对意义上也论及人，因为人的重生就是主之人身的荣耀的一个形像（参看<a href="3138.htm">3138</a>，<a href="3212.htm">3212</a>，<a href="3296.htm">3296</a>，<a href="3490.htm">3490</a>，<a href="4402.htm">4402</a>，<a href="5688.htm">5688</a>节）。由此明显可知，膏油的预备也意味着来自主、与一个人同在的爱之良善的产生和形成。因此，爱之良善通过教会从圣言所获得的真理而得以形成，首先通过外在真理，然后通过那些越来越内在的真理形成，正如刚才，尤其10252节所描述的；因此，外在人首先充满这些真理，然后内层人按连续阶段充满。要知道，这良善被主通过真理形成，并开始存在的秩序也是主保存它的秩序，或它持续存在的秩序。因为保存就是不断的形成，正如持续存在就是不断地存在。由此可推知，与一个人同在的爱之良善的性质取决于感知和情感的性质，并取决于此人充满真理所在的秩序。如果这情感是为了真理和良善的缘故而对真理的一种爱，而不是对它的一种自私和世俗的情感，如果秩序是从最外层逐步发展到越来越内在的层次，那么爱之良善就是真的；否则，它就是假的，根本不是良善。如果是在一开始，就是当此人开始被形成时，他对真理的情感也是为了自己和世界，则没有关系。不过，这种情感必须随着良善通过真理增长而脱去或剥落。此外，从那时起，这个人不断从这类事物中被洁净，如充满废物的肠道一样。人若以为一个人在没有信之真理，并照这些真理生活的情况下也能被赋予爱之良善，就大错特错了。</p>

By the preparation of the oil of anointing in what just precedes, there has been described the Divine good of the Lord's Divine love in His Divine Human; and in the relative sense the good of love with 
man from the Lord; for what is said in the Word, in the supreme sense, of the Lord, in the relative sense is said also of man, because the regeneration of man is an image of the glorification of the 
Lord's Human (see n. 3138, 3212, 3296, 3490, 4402, 5688). From this it is evident that the preparation of the oil of anointing involves also the generation and formation by the Lord of the good of love 
with man; consequently that the good of love is formed by means of the truths of the church which are from the Word, first by means of the external truths, and then by means of those which are more 
and more interior, according to the description in what just precedes; and that accordingly the external man is first imbued with these truths, and then the interior man successively. Be it known that 
this good is preserved by the Lord, and subsists, in the same order in which it had been formed by the Lord by means of truths, that is, in the order in which it had come forth; for preservation is 
perpetual formation, as subsistence is a perpetual coming-forth. From this it follows that the quality of the good of love with a man is according to the quality of the perception and the affection, 
and according to the order in which the man has become imbued with truths. If his affection of truth has been for the sake of truth and good, without affection for the sake of self and the world, and 
if the order has been from outermost things to more interior ones, by degrees, then the good of love is genuine; if otherwise, it is spurious, or not good. It matters not if in the beginning, when the 
man begins to be formed, his affection of truth is also for the sake of himself and the world. But this affection must be put off as good increases by means of truths; and moreover the man is afterward 
continually being purified from such things; as are the digestive organs, from what is of no use. He who believes that a man can be endowed with the good of love, without the truths of faith, and without 
a life in accordance with these, is very much mistaken. </p>

The preparation of the anointing oil in what has come immediately before has served to describe the Divine Good of the Lord's Divine Love within His Divine Human, and in the relative sense the good of 
love present from the Lord in a person. For that in the Word which in the highest sense says something about the Lord says something also in the relative sense about man, because human regeneration 
is an image of the glorification of the Lord's Human, <a href="3138.htm">3138</a>, <a href="3212.htm">3212</a>, <a href="3296.htm">3296</a>, <a href="3490.htm">3490</a>, <a href="4402.htm">4402</a>, <a href="5688.htm">5688</a>. From this it is evident that the preparation of the anointing oil implies also the generation and formation of 
the good of love present from the Lord with a person. As a consequence of this it implies that the good of love receives form through the truths which the Church derives from the Word, external ones 
first, then those that get more and more internal - in keeping with the description immediately before, especially in <a href="10252.htm">10252</a> - so that the external man is provided with them first, then the inner man in 
consecutive stages. It should be recognized that the order in which that good has been formed by the Lord by means of truths, or the order in which it has come into being, is also the order in which 
He preserves it, or the order in which it continues to exist. For preservation is unceasing formation, just as continued existence is an unceasing coming-into-being. From this it follows that the character 
of the perception and affection with which a person takes on truths, and also the order in which he does so, determines the nature of the good of love as it exists with him. If the affection has 
been a love of truth for truth's sake and for goodness' sake, without a selfish and worldly affection for it, and if the order has gone from outermost levels step by step to increasingly internal ones, 
the good of love is authentic. But if the affection has been anything other than that, the good is spurious, or not good at all. It does not matter if at first, when the formation starts to take place 
in the person, the affection for truth is also selfish and worldly; but this fault must be stripped away as good increases with the aid of truths. Also from then on the person is being unceasingly 
purged of those things, as the bowels are of waste matter. Anyone who thinks that a person can be endowed with the good of love without the truths of faith and without leading a life in accordance with 
them is much mistaken.  </p>

(s) Descriptum est in nunc praecedentibus per praeparationem olei unctionis Divinum Bonum Divini Amoris Domini in Divino Humano Ipsius, et in sensu respectivo bonum amoris apud hominem a Domino, nam 
quod in Verbo in supremo sensu dicitur de Domino, in respectivo etiam dicitur de homine, quoniam regeneratio hominis est imago glorificationis Humani Domini, n. 3138, 3212, 3296, 3490, 4402, 5688; inde 
patet quod praeparatio olei unctionis involvat etiam generationem et formationem boni amoris apud hominem a Domino; consequenter quod bonum amoris {1} formetur per vera Ecclesiae quae ex Verbo, primum 
externa, dein interiora magis et magis, secundum descriptionem in nunc praecedentibus imprimis n. 10,252, et quod sic primum externus homo, dein interior successive illis imbuatur. Sciendum est quod 
quo ordine bonum illud formatum est per vera a Domino, seu quo ordine exstiterat, eo etiam conservetur a Domino et subsistat, conservatio enim est perpetua formatio, sicut subsistentia est perpetua 
existentia; inde sequitur quod quali perceptione et affectione, et quo ordine, homo imbuit vera, tale ei bonum amoris sit; si affectio fuerit veri propter verum et propter bonum, absque affectione propter 
se et mundum, et si ordo fuerit ab extremis ad interiora per gradus, tunc bonum amoris est genuinum; si aliter, est spurium, aut non bonum; non refert, si in principio cum incipit formari homo, affectio 
veri sit etiam propter se et mundum, sed id exuendum est sicut crescit bonum per vera; et quoque homo deinceps purificatur ab illis jugiter, sicut alvus ab inutilibus. Qui credit quod homo donari 
possit bono amoris absque veris fidei et absque vita secundum illa, valde fallitur.(s) @1 i apud hominem generetur et$ </p>
