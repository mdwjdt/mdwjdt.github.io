<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5388节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5388.</strong>有一个灵人与我同在，与我交谈；活在肉身时，他们根本没有任何信仰，也不相信死后有任何生命。他还是一个相当勤奋的人。他能通过奉承人、随声附和迷惑人心。因此，他的品质无法立刻从他的谈话明显看出来。而且他说话很流利，如同行云流水，甚至像一个善灵。然而，凭他不喜欢谈论信与仁的事很快就能得知他的品质，因为那时，他的思维跟不上，故谈到这些话题，他犹豫不决。后来我从他所说的具体事发觉他奉承是为了骗人；因为奉承取决于它所关注的目的。如果目的是友谊，或交谈的乐趣等等，甚至是正当的利益，它就没有那么多害处；但是，如果目的是套出别人的秘密，由此逼迫别人做坏事，即一般来说如果目的是造成伤害，它就是邪恶的。这就是该灵人所关注的目的；他也反对那些处于肾脏和输尿管区域的人，还说他喜欢尿液的骚臭胜过其它一切气味；他给我造成了胃痉挛，或胃部疼痛性的紧缩。</p>

A certain spirit was with me, talking with me, who in the life of the body had had no faith, and had not believed in any life after death; he also had been one of the dexterous. He could captivate the 
minds of others by flattery and by giving assent, on which account his quality was not apparent at first from his discourse; he could also talk with volubility, like a stream, and like a good spirit. 
But his quality was first known by his not liking to speak about matters of faith and charity, for then he could not follow in thought, but drew back; and it was afterward perceived from several indications 
that he had been an assentor for the purpose of deceiving. For assentations are according to ends; if the end is friendship, or the pleasure of conversation, or the like, or even rightful gain, 
there is not so much harm in it; but if the end is to elicit secrets, and thereby bind another to evil services-in general if the end is to do harm-it is evil. Such was the end this spirit had in view, 
and he was also in opposition to those who are in the province of the kidneys and ureters. He too said that he loved the smell of urine above all other odors; and he caused a painful contraction 
or cramp in the lower region of the belly. </p>

There was once present with and talking to me a certain spirit who during his lifetime had had no faith at all and had not believed in any life after death. He had also been one of the quite hard-working. 
He had been able to captivate people's minds by speaking favourably to them and flattering them. For this reason it was not immediately evident from his conversation what he was really like. Also, 
he could speak fluently, like a running river, even as a good spirit can. Yet from this it was soon realized that he did not like to speak about matters of faith and charity, for being unable in his 
thinking to follow talk about these he was hesitant. Then I noticed from the particular things he said that he employed flattery that was intended to deceive; for the use of flattery is varied, depending 
on what its end in view may be. If the end in view, when someone resorts to flattery, is friendship, or the desire for social connections, or something similar, and also if material gain is allowable, 
then he is not behaving too badly. But if his end in view is to extract secrets from another person and in so doing to compel him to engage in wicked practices, in general if the end in view is 
to cause harm, he is behaving badly. And that was the kind of end that spirit had in view. He too was opposed to those in the province of the kidneys and ureters, and he too said he liked the stench 
of urine more than all other odours. He also inflicted a feeling of cramp or a painful tightness in the pit of my stomach. </p>

Quidam spiritus apud me fuit, mecum locutus, qui in vita corporis nullam fidem habuerat {1}, nec vitam aliquam post mortem crediderat; fuit etiam inter industrios unus; captare potuerat animos loquendo 
ad favorem et assentiendo, quapropter quod talis fuerit, non patuit primum et sermone ejus; potuit etiam {2} loqui volubiliter, fluvii instar, sicut bonus spiritus; at inde noscebatur primum quod 
non amaret loqui de illis quae sunt fidei et charitatis, tunc enim non potuit sequi cogitatione, sed se retraxit; et deinde perceptum ex singulis quod assentator fuerit fallendi causa; differunt enim 
assentationes secundum fines; si enim finis sit amicitia, aut voluptas conversationis, aliave  similis, et quoque {3} lucrum licitum, non est ita male, at si finis sit arcana eliciendi et sic devinciendi 
alterum ad officia mala, in genere si finis nocendi, tunc male; talis finis fuerat huic; hic spiritus etiam in opposito erat contra illos qui in provincia renum et ureterum {4}; dicebat etiam ille 
quod amaret nidorem urinae prae omnibus odoribus; injecit etiam contractionem seu angustiam dolorificam in regionem inferiorem ventris {5}. </p>
