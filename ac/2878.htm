<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2878节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2878.</strong> 作为人喜欢学习真理、意愿良善的动机和理由的因素不计其数。有很多因素源于这个世界，也有很多因素源于身体；有时这些事不是为天堂做的，更不是为主做的。人就这样被主藉着情感引入真理与良善，并且这个人完全不同于另一个人，各自都照着他的天赋和习性。由于他不断藉着情感，因而不断藉着他所具有的自由被引入真理与良善，最终被引入对属灵真理和属灵良善的情感中，故唯独主知道这些时间和这些状态，唯独祂以适合每个人天赋和生命的方式安排和掌管它们。由此明显可知为何人拥有自由。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2878</b></p><p><b>2878.</b>
There are innumerable causes from which and on account of which a man loves to learn truth and to will good (very many from the world, and also very many from the body); and sometimes these things are 
not done for the sake of heaven, and still less for the sake of the Lord. A man is thus introduced by the Lord into truth and good by affections, and one man altogether differently from another, each 
one according to his disposition, innate and acquired. And as he is continually being introduced into truth and good by affections, and thus continually by freedom, and at length into the affections 
of spiritual truth and spiritual good, the Lord alone knows the times and the states, and He alone arranges and governs them in application to each one's genius and life. This shows why man has freedom. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2878</b></p><p><b>2878.</b>
Countless causes exist as the origin and the reason for a person's love of learning what is true and willing what is good. Very many have a worldly origin and also very many have a bodily origin; and 
sometimes it is not heaven, still less the Lord, that is the reason. Man is thus introduced by the Lord into truth and good by means of affections, one person in an entirely different way from another, 
each one according to his innate and acquired disposition. And since he is introduced into truth and good constantly by means of affections, and so constantly by means of the freedom he has, and is 
at length introduced into affections for spiritual truth and spiritual good, the Lord alone knows those times and those states, and He alone organizes and governs them as is appropriate to the inclination 
and life of the individual. From this it is evident why man possesses freedom. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2878</b>
</p><b>2878.</b>
Innumerabiles causae sunt ex quibus et propter quas homo amat discere verum et velle bonum; sunt causae e mundo quamplurimae, sunt quoque e corpore quamplurimae, et quandoque tunc non propter caelum 
minus propter Dominum; introducitur homo a Domino in verum et bonum ita per affectiones, et unus homo prorsus aliter quam alter, quisque secundum suam indolem connatam et acquisitam; et quia introducitur 
in verum et bonum continue per affectiones, ita continue per libera, et tandem in affectiones veri spiritualis et boni spiritualis; tempora illa et status illos solus Dominus novit et solus applicate 
ad cujusvis genium et vitam disponit et regit:  inde patet cur homini liberum. </p>
