<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5221节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5221.</strong>“于是到了早晨”表在这种新状态下。这从“于是”或“就这样”和“早晨”的含义清楚可知：“于是”或“就这样”（或这事以后）暗示某种新事物（参看<a href="4979.htm">4979</a>，<a href="4987.htm">4987</a>节）；“早晨”是指一种启示的状态（<a href="3458.htm">3458</a>，<a href="3723.htm">3723</a>节）。该状态就是所表示的新状态，对此，参看刚才的内容（<a href="5218.htm">5218</a>节）。此处所论述的主题就是这个状态及其性质，即：由于对正在发生的那些事的模糊所造成的一种混乱。不过，几乎没有人能知道这种状态的性质，除非他进入属灵气场，同时注意到他里面所发生的事。<br />否则，他无法开始知道何谓接受总体启示，何谓接受具体启示。他甚至无法知道何谓接受启示，更不知道这一观念：一开始，一种混乱存在于总体启示的状态里面，并且没有暂缓或平息的时候，直到植根于良善的真理以其适当次序得以恢复。天使对这一切有清晰的觉知，善灵也是，因为他们生活在属灵气场中。对他们来说，知道并思想这些事是快乐的源头。但对处于属世气场的人，尤其处于感官意识气场的人，更尤其对处于来自肉体和尘世事物的更粗糙的感官意识气场的人来说，这些事让人厌烦。</p>

And it came to pass in the morning. That this signifies in this new state, is evident from the signification of "it came to pass," or "it was," as involving what is new (see n. 4979, 4987); and from 
the signification of the "morning," as being a state of enlightenment (n. 3458, 3723). This is that new state which is meant, in regard to which see just above (n. 5218). This state and its quality are 
treated of here, showing that there was disturbance therein by reason of obscurity regarding the things that were happening. But as regards the quality of this state scarcely anyone is able to know 
anything unless he is in a spiritual sphere and at the same time pays attention to the things that are taking place within him. Otherwise he cannot even know what it is to be generally enlightened, and 
particularly enlightened, nor even what it is to be enlightened at all, still less that there is a disturbance at first in a general state of enlightenment, and that there is no quiet until the time 
when truths from good are replaced in their order. How the case herein is, is clearly perceived by the angels, and also by good spirits, because they are in a spiritual sphere. To be wise in such subjects, 
and to think about them, is delightful to them; but to the man who is in a natural sphere, and still more to one who is in a sensuous sphere, and yet more to one who is in a more grossly sensuous 
sphere from bodily and earthly things, such subjects are wearisome. </p>

'And it happened early in the morning' means in that new state. This is clear from the meaning of 'it happened', or so it was, as that which implies something new, dealt with in <a href="4979.htm">4979</a>, <a href="4987.htm">4987</a>; and from 
the meaning of 'early' or 'the morning" as a state of enlightenment, dealt with in <a href="3458.htm">3458</a>, <a href="3723.htm">3723</a>, this state being the new one that is meant, about which see just above in <a href="5218.htm">5218</a>. The subject here is that 
state and the nature of it, namely one of turmoil owing to the obscurity that exists regarding the things that are taking place. But scarcely anyone can know anything about what that state is like unless 
he has come into a spiritual sphere and at the same time takes note of what is going on inside himself. </p>

 Unless he does so he cannot begin to know what is meant by receiving a general enlightenment 
or by receiving a particular enlightenment. He cannot even know what is meant by receiving enlightenment, let alone the idea that within a state of general enlightenment<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> turmoil exists initially 
and that there is no respite until truths rooted in good are restored in their proper order. Angels have a clear perception of all this, and so do good spirits, because they live in a spiritual sphere. 
To know about such matters and to think them over is a source of delight to them. But to someone in a natural sphere, more so to someone in a sphere of sensory-mindedness, and more so still to one 
who is completely sensory-minded and concerned only with ideas gained from bodily and earthly things, such matters are of no interest.

<a name="fn1"></a><a href="#fntext1"><sup>a</sup></a> The first Latin edition reads within a general state of enlightenment, 
but Swedenborg's rough draft reads within a state of general enlightenment. </p>

`Et factum in matutino': quod significet in novo illo statu, constat a significatione `factum' seu fuit quod involvat novum, de qua n. 4979, 4987; et ex significatione `matutini' seu mane quod sit illustrationis 
status, de qua n. 3458, 3723, hic status est ille novus qui intelligitur, de quo videatur mox supra n. 5218; agitur hic de illo statu et ejus quali, quod nempe turba ibi propter obscurum 
de contingentibus; sed de quali illius status vix aliquis scire quid potest, nisi sit in sphaera spirituali, et tunc simul in attentione ad illa quae intus peraguntur; [2] alioquin ne quidem sciri potest 
quid sit communiter illustrari, et particulariter illustrari, et ne quidem quid sit illustrari, minus quod in {1}communi illustrationis statu principio sit turba, et quod non prius tranquillum quam 
cum vera ex bono reposita sunt in suo ordine; quomodo haec se habent, clare percipitur ab angelis, etiam a spiritibus bonis, quia hi in sphaera spirituali sunt; talia sapere et cogitare illis deliciae 
sunt, at homini qui in sphaera naturali est, et magis qui in sphaera sensuali, et adhuc magis qui in crasse sensuali ex (x)corporeis et terrestribus, talia taedia sunt. @1 communis$ </p>
