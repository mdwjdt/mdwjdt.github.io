<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9278节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9278.</strong>“六日你要作工”表劳碌和争战的状态，就是当人处于必须与内在事物结合的外在事物或快乐之时。这从“六日”的含义清楚可知，第七日之前的“六日”是指劳碌和争战的状态（参看<a href="737.htm">737</a>，<a href="900.htm">900</a>，<a href="8510.htm">8510</a>，<a href="8888.htm">8888</a>，<a href="8975.htm">8975</a>节），在此其间的劳碌和争战由他们在六日内所要做的“工”来表示。六日内所作的“工”和第七日的“休息”表示在重生期间，一个人在第一个状态和第二个状态下所经历的事，以及他在重生之后所经历的事。关于一个人在重生期间的第一和第二个状态，可参看前文（<a href="9274.htm">9274</a>节）；关于他重生之后所经历的事（<a href="9213.htm">9213</a>节）。这些事之所以发生，是为了叫外在事物能与内在事物结合起来；因为有一个外在人，它也被称为必属世人；还有一个内在人，它也被称为属灵人。外在人与世界相通，内在人与天堂相通。<br />神性秩序要求，天堂当统治与人同在的世界，而不是世界统治与他同在的天堂；因为当天堂统治一个人时，就是主在统治他；而当世界统治一个人时，就是地狱在统治他。人生来就爱世界爱自己胜过天堂和主；由于这是神性秩序的对立面，所以必须通过重生翻转过来。当爱属于天堂和主的事物胜过属于世界和自我的事物时，这种翻转就实现了。这就是一个重生之人，以及一个在天堂里的人会经历两种相互交替的状态的原因，在其中一种状态下，外在事物占上风，在另一种状态下，内在事物占上风；因为通过这种状态的交替，外在事物被如此安排以至于与内在事物一致；最终从属于它们。<br />当外在事物占上风时，人经历劳碌和争战；因为他沉浸在品味世界一种生命中，地狱从四面八方进入该生命，不断努力进行侵扰，甚至对与此人同在的天堂事物实施掌控；但主不断保护并解救他。这就是七天之中必须要作工的“六日”所表示的劳碌和争战的原因。然而，当内在人占上风时，因他与主同在天堂，所以这时劳碌和争战止息，他享受和平与安宁，结合也是在这种和平与安宁中进行的。这些祝福就是“第七日”所表示的。人的内层是照着天堂的形像被造的，他的外层照着世界的形像被造的；因此，人就是天堂和世界的一个缩影，按古人的称呼，就是一个小宇宙（参看<a href="6057.htm">6057</a>节）。正因如此，根据神性秩序，经由天堂而来的主当统治与人同在的世界，绝不可反过来。<br />从以下事实可以看出，当外在事物占上风时，人所经历的劳碌和争战是何性质，即：这时他对世界是热的，对天堂是冷的，或说被世界所激动，对天堂漠不关心，除非天堂在他看来如同世界。但此时他用来看见的光如此昏暗，或说他处于如此的阴影之中，以致他只会以为：外在事物流入内在事物；因此，眼睛凭自己看见，耳朵凭自己听见；所看见或听见的东西产生思维，塑造心智的理解力部分；于是，他全凭自己就能信神爱神，因而从世界来看天堂。他无法轻易地被引离这种幻觉，除非他从外在事物被提升至内在事物，从而被提升至天堂之光。这时，他才开始发觉，属于与他同在的世界的事物，因而属于肉体及其感官的事物，通过来自天堂，也就是从主经由天堂而来的流注看见并行动，根本不是凭它们自己。由此明显可知为何感官人以为他生命的一切皆来自世界和自然界；没有地狱，也没有天堂；最终以为没有神。结果，就他自己而言，他嘲笑教会的一切事物；但关系到简单人，他完全支持教会，认为除法律之外，这也是束缚他们的一个手段。<br />由此可知，外在事物占上风，同时内在事物不占上风是什么情况；当外在事物占上风时，人对属于天堂、属于主的事物感觉冷淡，漠不关心，只在昏暗的光中来看它们。由此也可知，到底谁是这个世界上最聪明、最智慧的人，就是那些处于教会的真理和良善之人，因为他们是来自天堂的智慧的接受者；还可知到底谁是最愚蠢、最疯狂的，就是那些未处于教会的真理和良善之人，因为世界是他们知识的唯一源头。他们当中那些利用世俗知识坚决反对教会真理和良善的人比其他人更疯狂、愚蠢，无论他们多么以为自己在聪明智慧上胜过他人；他们将基于教义的真理过着一种良善生活的人称为简单人。而在天使眼里，这些人的简单却是智慧；死后，他们被主提升至天使的智慧。<br />主在马太福音中也教导，情况就是这样：<br />所以我用比喻来讲，是因他们看也看不见，听也听不见，也不明白。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.13.htm">13:13</a>）<br />约翰福音：<br />我要差真理的圣灵，乃世人不能接受的，因为不见祂，也不认识祂。还有不多的时候，世人不再看见我。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.17.htm">14:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.19.htm">19</a>）<br />“真理的圣灵，乃世人不能接受的，因为不见祂，也不认识祂”表示世人不会以内心的信仰来承认主，因为属于世界的外在事物会模糊祂。既然如此，那么还有谁会拜祂为天地之主呢（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太18.18.htm">18:18</a>）？然而，所有在天堂里的人，因而所有处于内在事物的人都视主为他们唯一的神。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9278</b></p><p><b>9278.</b>
Six days thou shalt do thy works. That this signifies the state of labor and of combat when the man is in external delights that are to be conjoined with internal, is evident from the signification of 
the "six days" which precede the seventh, as being a state of labor and of combat (see n. 737, 900, 8510, 8888, 8975). The labor and combat then are signified by the "works" which they were to do in 
the six days. By the "works of the six days," and the "rest on the seventh day," are signified those things which come forth in man in his first, and in his second state, during regeneration, and also 
those which come forth in him when he has been regenerated.  (Concerning the first and second states of man during regeneration, see above, n. 9274; and concerning those things which come forth with 
him when he has been regenerated, n. 9213.) These things take place to the end that external things may be conjoined with internal; for there is an external man, which is also called natural; and there 
is an internal man, which is also called spiritual. The external man communicates with the world, and the internal man with heaven.  [2] The Divine order is that heaven should rule the world in man, 
and not the world rule heaven in him; for when heaven rules man, then the Lord rules him. Man is born into loving the world and himself more than heaven and the Lord. And because this is opposite 
to Divine order, there must be an inversion by means of regeneration; and this inversion is effected when the things of heaven and the Lord are loved more than those of the world and of self. This is 
the reason why the man who has been regenerated, as also he who is in heaven, is alternately in external and in internal things; for external things are thereby disposed so as to agree with internal things; 
and finally to be subject to them.  [3] When a man is in external things, he is in labor and combat, for he is then in a life which savors of the world, into which the hells flow from all sides, 
continually endeavoring to infest, and even to subjugate in the man the things of heaven; but the Lord continually protects and sets him free. From this arise the labor and combat which are signified 
by the "six days of the week in which works are to be done." But when the man is in internal things, then, because he is in heaven with the Lord, the labor and combat cease, and he is in the tranquility 
of peace, in which tranquility conjunction also is effected. These are the things which are signified by the "seventh day." That the interiors of man have been created according to the image of 
heaven, and his exteriors according to the image of the world; thus that man is a heaven and a world in a little form, and according to the maxim of the ancients, is a microcosm, may be seen above (n. 
6057); and consequently that it is according to Divine order that the Lord through heaven directs the world in man, and by no means the reverse.  [4] The nature of the labor and combat when a man is 
in external things, can be seen from the fact that he is then in such a state as to be in heat from the world and to be cold toward heaven, unless heaven be to him as the world; and that he is consequently 
in such a shade that he cannot conceive otherwise than that external things flow into internal, and consequently that the eye sees and the ear hears of itself, and that their objects bring forth 
thoughts, and produce the intellect, and that thereupon he is able of himself to believe, and likewise to love God; consequently from the world to see heaven. From this fallacy he can scarcely be withdrawn 
until he has been raised from external things into internal, and thus into the light of heaven. Then for the first time he perceives that the things in him which are of the world, thus which are 
of the body and its senses, see and act through influx from heaven, that is, through heaven from the Lord, and not at all from themselves. From this it is evident why a sensuous man believes that everything 
of his life is from the world and from nature; that there is no hell, nor heaven; and finally that there is no God; consequently why he ridicules everything of the church insofar as he is concerned; 
but is in favor of it insofar as it concerns the simple, so that they may be in bonds, in addition to those of the laws. [5] From this it can be known what it is to be in external things, and 
not at the same time in internal things, and that when a man is in external things, he is in cold and shade in respect to the things which are of heaven and which are of the Lord. From this also it 
can be known who in this world are intelligent and wise, namely, those who are in the truth and good of the church, because these are wise from heaven; and also who are foolish and insane, namely, those 
who are not in the good and truth of the church, because their knowledge is derived solely from the world; and that those among them who by means of the sciences of the world have confirmed themselves 
against the truths and goods of the church, are more insane and foolish that the rest, however much they may believe themselves intelligent and wise in comparison with others, and may call those simple 
who are in the good of life from the truths of doctrine; when yet the simplicity of these latter is wisdom in the eyes of the angels, and moreover after death they are raised by the Lord into angelic 
wisdom. [6] That this is the case, the Lord also teaches in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Therefore speak I by parables; because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand (Matt. 
13:13). And in John: </p>
<p>     I will send the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive; for it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him. Yet a little while, and the world shall see Me no more (John 14:17, 
19); </p>
<p>"the Spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him," signifies that the world will not acknowledge the Lord with faith of the heart, because 
external things which are of the world will obscure. Consequently who at the present day adores Him as the Lord of the whole heaven and the whole earth (Matt. 18:18)? And yet all who are in the heavens, 
thus all who are in internal things, regard the Lord as their only God. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9278</b></p><p><b>9278.</b>
'Six days you shall do your work' means a state of labour and conflict, when a person is governed by external delights that must be joined to things that are internal. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'six days' that come before the seventh, as states of labour and conflict, dealt with in <a href="737.htm">737</a>, <a href="900.htm">900</a>, <a href="8510.htm">8510</a>, <a href="8888.htm">8888</a>, <a href="8975.htm">8975</a>, the labour and conflict during them being meant by 'the work' that will be done 
on those days. 'The work' done during the six days and 'the rest' on the seventh day mean the things experienced by a person in his first state and in his second while being regenerated, and also those 
experienced by him after he has been regenerated. Regarding a person's first and second states while he is being regenerated, see above in <a href="9274.htm">9274</a>; and regarding the things experienced by him after he 
has been regenerated, <a href="9213.htm">9213</a>. The purpose of these experiences is that external things may be joined to internal ones; for there is an external man, which is also called natural, and there is an internal 
man, which is called spiritual. The external man is in contact with the world, and the internal with heaven.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Divine order demands that heaven should rule the world with a person and not the 
world rule heaven with him; for when heaven rules a person, the Lord rules him, but when the world rules a person, the hells rule him. The natural disposition which a person is born with is such that 
he loves the world and self more than heaven and the Lord; and since this is the opposite of Divine order, an inversion must take place through regeneration. It takes place when the things that belong 
to heaven and the Lord are loved more than those which belong to the world and self. This is the reason why a person who has been regenerated, and also one who is in heaven, passes through two states 
that alternate with each other, in one of which external things prevail and in the other internal ones prevail; for by means of this alternation of states the external things are brought into agreement 
with the internal and at length made subordinate to them.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 When the external things prevail the person experiences labour and conflict; for he is immersed in the kind of life which savours of 
the world and into which the hells enter from every side, unceasingly endeavouring to engage in molestation, indeed to exercise control over the things of heaven with the person. But the Lord unceasingly 
protects and delivers him. This is the reason for the labour and conflict which are meant by the six days of the week in which work must be done. When however the internal things prevail, then - 
because the person is in heaven with the Lord - the labour and conflict come to an end, and he enjoys peace and serenity, in which also a joining together takes place. These blessings are what are meant 
by 'the seventh day'. The more internal aspects of the human being have been created in the image of heaven and the more external in the image of the world, so that the human being is a miniature 
form of heaven, also of the world, thus a microcosm, as the ancients called him, see <a href="6057.htm">6057</a>. So it is that Divine order demands that the Lord coming by way of heaven should rule the world with a person, 
and not at all vice versa.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The nature of the labour and conflict experienced by the person when external things prevail may be recognized from this, that his state at that time is such that he 
is stirred by the world and indifferent towards heaven, unless it appears to him as the world does. But then the light by which he sees is so dim that he can only suppose that external things flow into 
internal ones, consequently that the eye sees or the ear hears by itself, that objects seen or heard by them are what produce thoughts and shape the understanding part of the mind, and that this gives 
him the ability to believe in and love God all by himself, and so to see heaven from the world. He cannot be easily led away from this illusion until he has been raised from external things to internal 
ones, and so to the light of heaven. Then he begins to perceive that things belonging to the world with him, thus those belonging to the body and its senses, see and act by means of influx from 
heaven, that is, from the Lord coming by way of heaven, and not at all by themselves. This goes to show why it is that a person thinking on the level of the senses supposes that his life is derived entirely 
from the world and the natural order, that there is no hell nor any heaven, and finally that there is no God. As a consequence he derides everything of the Church so far as he himself is concerned 
but is all in favour of it so far as the simple are concerned, as the means in addition to laws to keep them in check.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 From all this people may know what is meant by a situation in which 
external things prevail and not at the same time internal ones, and that when external things prevail a person feels indifferent towards what belongs to heaven or what belongs to the Lord and sees it 
in only dim light. They may also know who exactly in the world are the intelligent and wise, namely those who are governed by the Church's truth and good because they are recipients of wisdom from heaven, 
and who exactly are the stupid and foolish, namely those who are not governed by the Church's truth or good because the world is their only source of knowledge. And those among them who use worldly 
knowledge to set themselves firmly against the Church's truth and good are more foolish and stupid than the rest, no matter how much they suppose themselves to excel others in intelligence and wisdom 
and call people simple if they lead a good life based on the truths taught by doctrine. But such people's simplicity is wisdom in angels' eyes; and after death they are raised by the Lord into angelic 
wisdom.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 The Lord also teaches that this is so, in Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
Therefore I speak in parables, because those who see do not see, and those who hear do not hear, nor do they understand. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:13,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13:13, 14</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In John,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will send the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him. Yet a little while, the world will see Me no longer. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:17</a>, 
<a href="19.htm">19</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>The world's inability to receive the Spirit of truth 'because it neither sees Him nor knows Him' means that it will not acknowledge the Lord with faith in the heart, because external things 
belonging to the world will obscure [Him]. This being so, is there anyone at the present day who worships Him as the Lord of the whole of heaven and of earth, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2028:18?&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 28:18?</a> Yet all who are in heaven, and 
so with whom internal things prevail, see the Lord as their only God.  </p>

`Sex diebus facies opera tua': quod significet statum laboris et pugnae quando in jucundis externis quae conjungenda internis, constat ex significatione `sex dierum qui praecedunt septimum' quod sint 
status laboris et pugnae, de qua n. 737, 900, 8510, 8888, 8975; labor tunc et pugna significantur per `opera' quae in diebus illis facturi.  Per `opera sex dierum' et per `quietem in die septimo' significantur 
quae existunt apud hominem in primo et (o)in altero ejus statu cum regeneratur; et quoque quae existunt apud illum cum regeneratus est; de primo et altero statu hominis cum regeneratur, videatur 
supra n. 927 4, et de illis quae existunt apud eum cum regeneratus est {1}, n. 9213; haec fiunt {2} ob finem ut externa conjungantur internis; est enim homo externus, qui etiam naturalis vocatur, 
et est homo internus, qui spiritualis vocatur; homo externus communicat cum mundo et internus cum caelo. 	[2] Ordo Divinus est ut caelum regat mundum apud hominem, et non mundus caelum apud illum, 
cum enim caelum regit hominem, tunc Dominum regit illum, at cum mundus regit hominem, tunc inferna regunt illum; homo in id {3} natus est ut amet mundum et se prae caelo et Domino; hoc quia {4} oppositum 
est ordini Divino, per regenerationem invertendum est, quod fit cum illa quae caeli ac Domini sunt, plus amantur quam illa quae mundi et sui; haec causa est quod homo qui regeneratus est, (o)ut et 
qui in caelo, alternis sit in externis et (x)alternis in internis; nam per id disponuntur externa ut concordent cum internis, ac tandem ut illa his subjiciantur. 	[3] Cum homo in externis est, tunc 
in labore et pugna est, nam est in vita quae sapit e mundo, in quam influunt ab undique inferna, quae continuo conantur infestare, immo subjugare illa quae caeli sunt apud hominem, sed Dominus continuo 
tutatur et liberat; inde nunc labor et pugna, quae significantur per `sex dies septimanae in quibus fient opera'; at cum homo in internis est, tunc quia in caelo est apud Dominum, cessat labor et pugna, 
estque in tranquillo pacis, in quo etiam fit conjunctio; haec sunt quae significantur per `diem septimum.'  (m)Quod interiora hominis creata sint secundum imaginem mundi, et sic quod homo in exigua 
forma sit caelum, et sit mundus, ita secundum formulam antiquorum microcosmus, videatur n. 6057, proinde quod secundum (o)Divinum ordinem sit ut Dominus per caelum regat mundum apud hominem, et nullatenus 
vicissim {5}. 	[4] Qualis labor et pugna sit cum homo in externis est, constare potest ex eo quod tunc in tali statu {6} sit ut incalescat ex mundo, (o)et frigescat ad caelum nisi hoc sit sicut 
mundus, et (o)quod inde in tali umbra sit ut non aliter capere possit quam quod externa influant in interna, consequenter quod oculus videat et auris audiat ex se, et quod eorum objecta producant cogitationes, 
et sistant intellectuale, et inde quod ex se credere et ex se amare (x)Deum possit, proinde ex mundo videre caelum; e qua fallacia vix abduci potest priusquam ab externis in interna, et sic 
in lucem caeli, elevatus est; tunc primum percipit quod illa quae mundi sunt apud se, ita quae corporis et ejus sensuum, videant et agant per influxum e caelo hoc est, per caelum a Domino, et prorsus 
nihil a se; inde patet unde est quod homo sensualis credat quod e mundo et ex natura sit omne vitae ejus, {7} quod non infernum sit nec caelum, et tandem quod non Deus; consequenter quod rideat omne 
Ecclesiae quantum ad se sed affirmet quantum ad simplices, ut in vinculis praeter ex legibus sint. 	[5] Inde sciri potest quid sit in externis et non simul in internis esse, et quod homo cum in externis 
est, in frigore et in umbra {8} sit quoad illa quae caeli et quae Domini sunt; et quoque inde sciri potest quinam in mundo intelligentes et sapientes sunt, quod nempe illi qui in vero et bono Ecclesiae 
sunt, quia hi sapiunt ex caelo, tum quinam stulti et deliri, quod nempe illi qui non in vero et bono Ecclesiae sunt, quia solum sciunt ex mundo; et qui horum per scientias mundi confirmaverunt 
se contra vera et bona Ecclesiae, quod ii plus reliquis deliri et stulti sint, utcumque se credunt intelligentes et sapientes prae aliis, et illos qui in bono vitae ex veris doctrinae sunt, simplices 
vocant; cum tamen simplicitas horum est sapientia coram angelis, etiam hi post mortem in sapientiam angelicam elevantur a Domino. 	[6] Quod ita sit, etiam docet Dominum apud Matthaeum, 	Propterea per 
parabolas loquor, quia videntes non vident, et audientes non audiunt, nec intelligunt, xiii 13, 14: </p>
<p>{9} apud Johannem, 	Mittam spiritum veritatis, quem mundus non potest accipere, quoniam non videt 
illum, neque cognoscit {10} illum; adhuc parum dum mundus Me non amplius videbit, xiv 17, 19: </p>
<p>quod `mundus spiritum veritatis non possit accipere, quoniam non videt illum, neque cognoscit illum {11}
