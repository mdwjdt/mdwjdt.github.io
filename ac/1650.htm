A continuation concerning the speech of spirits, and its diversities, will be found at the end of this chapter.            GENESIS 14      1. And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, 
Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,       2. That they made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber 
king of Zeboiim, and with the king of Bela, this is Zoar.      3. All these were gathered together at the valley of Siddim, this is the Salt Sea.      4. Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, 
and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.      5. And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and 
the Emim in Shavehkiriathaim; </p>
<p>     6. And the Horites in their Mount Seir, even to El-paran which is over in the wilderness.      7. And they returned, and came to En-mishpat, this is Kadesh, and smote 
all the field of the Amalekites, and also the Amorite that dwelt in Hazazon-tamar.      8. And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, 
and the king of Bela, this is Zoar; and they set the battle in array with them in the valley of Siddim; </p>
<p>     9. With Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, 
and Arioch king of Ellasar: four kings with five.      10. And the valley of Siddim was pits, pits of bitumen; and the king of Sodom and of Gomorrah fled, and they fell there, and they that remained 
fled to the mountain.      11. And they took all the wealth of Sodom, and of Gomorrah, and all their food, and departed.      12. And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, and his substance, 
and departed; and he was dwelling in Sodom.      13. And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; and he was dwelling in the oak-groves of Mamre the Amorite, the brother of Eshcol, 
and the brother of Aner; and these were men of the covenant of Abram.      14. And Abram heard that his brother was made captive; and he hastened his trained men that were born in his house, three hundred 
and eighteen, and pursued unto Dan.      15. And he divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and smote then, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left of Damascus.  
    16. And he brought back all the substance, and also brought back his brother Lot and his substance, and the women also, and the people.      17. And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after 
his return from smiting Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, this is the king's valley.      18. And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine, and he 
was priest to GOD MOST HIGH.       19. And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram to GOD MOST HIGH, Possessor of the heavens and the earth.      20. And blessed be GOD MOST HIGH, who hath delivered 
thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.      21. And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the soul, and take the substance to thyself.      22. And Abram said to the king 
of Sodom, I have lifted up my hand to JEHOVAH GOD MOST HIGH, Possessor of the heavens and the earth; </p>
<p>     23. That from a thread even to the thong of a shoe, I will not take aught that is thine; 
lest thou shouldest say, I have enriched Abram.      24. Save only that which the boys have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion. </p>

<p>                          CAPUT XIV 	1.  ET fuit in diebus Amraphelis regis Shinar, Ariochi regis Ellasar, 
Kedorlaomeri regis Elami, et Tidalis regis Goiim, 	2.  Fecerunt bellum cum Bera rege Sodomae, et cum Birsha rege Amorae, Shinab rege Admae, et Shemeber rege Zeboiim, et rege Belae, haec Zoar. 	3. 
 Omnes hi congregati sunt ad vallem Siddim, haec mare salis. 	4.  Duodecim annis serviverunt Kedorlaomero, et tertio decimo anno rebellarunt. 	5.  Et in quarto decimo anno venit Kedorlaomer, et reges 
qui cum illo, et percusserunt Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, et Zuzim in Ham, et Emim in Shave Kiriathaim. 	6.  Et Horitas in monte eorum Seir, usque El-paran, quae super in desertum. 	7. Et reversi 
sunt et venerunt ad En-mishpat, haec Kadesh, et percusserunt omnem agrum Amalekitarum, et etiam Emoraeum habitantem in Hazezon-tamar. 	8.  Et exivit rex Sodomae, et rex Amorae, et rex Admae, et rex 
Zeboiim, et rex Belae, haec Zoar, et, ordinaverunt cum iis praelium in valle Siddim; </p>
<p>	9.  Cum Kedorlaomero rege Elam, et Tidale rege Goiim, et Amraphele rege Shinar, et Ariocho rege Ellasar; quatuor 
reges cum quinque. 	10.  Et vallis Siddim putei putei bituminis; et fugerunt rex Sodomae et Amorae, et ceciderunt ibi, et residui in montem fugerunt. 	11.  Et sumpserunt omnes opes Sodomae et Amorae, 
et omnem cibum eorum, et abiverunt. 	12.  Et sumpserunt Lotum, et acquisitionem ejus, filium fratri Abrami, et abiverunt; et is habitans in Sodoma. 	13.  Et venit evasor, et indicavit Abramo Hebraeo, 
et is habitans in quercetis Mamre Emoraei, fratris Eshkoli, et fratris Aneri; et hi viri foederis Abrami. 	14.  Et audivit Abram, quod captivus factus frater ejus, e expedivit initiatos suos, natos 
domus suae, octodecim et trecentos et persecutus est usque Dan. 	15.  Et distribuit se super eos noctu, ille et servi illius, et percussi eos, et persecutus est eos usque ad Hobam, quae a sinistra 
Damasco 	16.  Et reduxit omnem acquisitionem; et etiam Lotum fratrem suum, et acquisitionem ejus, reduxit, et etiam mulieres et populum. 	17.  Et exivit rex Sodomae obviam illi, postquam reversus 
est ille a percutiendo Kedorlaomerum, et reges qui cum illo, ad vallem Shaveh, haec vallis regis. 	18.  Et Malkizedech, rex Shalem, eduxit panem et vinum, et ille sacerdos DEO ALTISSIMO. 	19.  Et benedixit 
illi, et dixit, Benedictus Abram DEO ALTISSIMO Possessori caelorum et terrae. 	20.  Et benedictus DEUS ALTISSIMUS, Qui tradidit hostes tuos in manum tuam; et dedit illi decimas de omnibus. 	21. 
 Et dixit rex Sodomae ad Abramum, Da mihi animam, et acquisitionem accipe tibi. 	22.  Et dixit Abram ad regem Sodomae, Elevavi manum meam ad JEHOVAH DEUM ALTISSIMUM, Possessorem caelorum et terrae. 	23. 
 Si a filo et usque ad corrigiam calcei, et si accepero ab ullo quod tibi, ne dicas, Ego ditavi Abramum. 	24.  Praeter tantum quod comederunt pueri, et portionem virorum, qui iverunt mecum, 
Aner, Eshkol et Mamre, hi accipient portionem suam. </p>
