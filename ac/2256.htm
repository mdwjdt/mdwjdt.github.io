<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2256节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2256.</strong>“使义人与恶人一同死亡，让义人与恶人一样”表良善不会死亡，因为邪恶会和它分开。这从“义人”和“恶人”的含义清楚可知，“义人”是指良善，“恶人”是指邪恶（参看<a href="2250.htm">2250</a>节）。因此，“使义人与恶人一同死亡”是指使良善与邪恶一同死亡。由于这种事是不能做的，只是想想就会恐惧，故就内义而言，它被除去，这时以下情况就出现了：即良善不会死亡，因为邪恶会和它分开。<br />很少有人知道这个问题到底是怎么回事。要知道，人从小直到临终所思所行的一切良善都会保留；一切邪恶同样如此，以致邪恶丝毫不会完全消失。这二者都被铭刻在他的生命册上（即他的每个记忆中），以及他的真我（即他的秉性和性情）中。他通过这良善与邪恶为自己形成一个生命，也可以说形成一个灵魂。死后，这生命或灵魂的本质保持不变。不过，良善从不与邪恶、邪恶也从不与良善混和到它们无法分离的地步。否则，这人必永远灭亡。对此，主的天命是，它们不可混和。当人进入来世后，若他活在爱与仁的良善中，这时，主会将他的邪恶分离出去，并凭他所拥有的良善将其提升天堂。但若他活在邪恶中，也就是说，过着违背爱与仁的生活，这时，主会将良善从他那里分离出去，他的邪恶便将他带入地狱。这就是每个人死后的命运。不过，这只是分离，绝不是完全除去。</p>

To cause the righteous to die with the wicked, that so the righteous be as the wicked. That this signifies that good cannot die, because evil can be separated from it, is evident from the signification 
of "righteous," as being good, and of "wicked," as being evil (see above, n. 2250). Hence to "cause the righteous to die with the wicked," is to make good die with evil. As this ought not to be done, 
and causes horror to think of, it is removed in the internal sense, and then there is presented this: that good cannot die, because evil can be separated from it. [2] How this matter stands, is known 
to few, if any. Be it known that all the good a man has thought and done from infancy even to the last of his life, remains; in like manner all the evil, so that not the least of it completely perishes. 
Both are inscribed on his book of life (that is, on each of his memories), and on his nature (that is, his native disposition and genius). From these he has formed for himself a life, and so to 
speak a soul, which after death is of a corresponding quality. But goods are never so commingled with evils, nor evils with goods, that they cannot be separated; for if they should be commingled, the 
man would eternally perish. In relation to this the Lord exercises His providence, and when a man comes into the other life, if he has lived in the good of love and of charity, the Lord then separates 
his evils, and by what is good with him elevates him into heaven. But if he has lived in evils, that is, in things contrary to love and charity, the Lord then separates from him what is good, and his 
evils bring him into hell. Such is the lot of everyone after death; but it is a separation, and in no wise a complete removal. [3] Moreover, as the will of man, which is the one part of his life, has 
been utterly destroyed, the Lord separates this destroyed part from the other which is his intellectual part, and in those who are being regenerated, implants in this intellectual part the good of 
charity, and through this a new will; these are they who have conscience. Thus also, speaking generally, the Lord separates evil from good. These are the arcana which are meant in the internal sense by 
the statement that good cannot die, because evil can be separated from it. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2256</b></p><p><b>2256.</b>
That 'as to make the righteous die with the wicked, so that the righteous will be as the wicked' means that good cannot die, because evil can be separated from it, is clear from the meaning of 'the righteous' 
as good and of 'the wicked' as evil, dealt with above in <a href="2250.htm">2250</a>. From this 'to make the righteous die with the wicked' means making good perish with evil; but because this ought never to be done, 
and also because the very thought of it evokes horror, it is removed in the internal sense, and the following is at the same time presented - that good cannot die, because evil can be separated from 
it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The implications of this particular matter are known to few, if any. It has to be recognized that all the good whatever that a person has thought and done from earliest childhood through 
to the very end of his life remains; and the same applies to all the evil, so much so that not even the least trace of it completely perishes. All that good and evil is written in his book of life, that 
is, in each of his memories,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and in his true self, that is, in his character and disposition. From that good and evil he has formed a life for himself and, so to speak, a soul, the essential nature 
of which remains unchanged after death. But goods are never so mixed up with evils, nor evils with goods, that they cannot be separated; for if they were so mixed a person would perish for ever. The 
Lord sees to it that they are not. If he has led a life abiding in the goods of love and charity, then when a person enters the next life the Lord separates the evils, and by means of the goods present 
with him raises him into heaven. But if he has led a life immersed in evils, that is to say, in things contrary to love and charity, the Lord separates the goods from him, and his evils carry him 
into hell. Such is the experience of everyone after death. But it is a separation and in no way a complete removal. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 What is more, because the will of man, which constitutes the one part of his 
life, has been utterly destroyed, the Lord separates that destroyed part from the other part, which is that of his understanding, and in this other part He implants - in the case of those who are being 
regenerated - the good of charity and through this a new will. These are they who have conscience. In the same manner also the Lord in general separates evil from good. Such are the arcana that are 
meant in the internal sense by the statement that good cannot die, because evil can be separated from it.

Quod `ad mori faciendum justum cum impio, et sit sic justus sicut impius' significet quod bonum non mori possit quia malum inde separari potest, constat ex significatione `justi' quod sit bonum, ac 
`impii' quod sit malum, de qua supra n. 2250, inde `ad mori faciendum justum cum impio' est bonum cum malo; haec, quia fieri non debent, tum quia id cogitare horrorem facit, removentur in sensu interno, 
et tunc sistuntur haec, quod bonum non mori possit quia malum inde separari potest.  [2] Quomodo haec se habent, paucis si ullis notum est; sciendum quod omne bonum quodcumque cogitavit et fecit homo 
ab infantia usque ad ultimum vitae ejus, remaneat; similiter omne malum adeo ut ne minimum ejus prorsus pereat; inscripta sunt ejus libro vitae, hoc est, ejus memoriae utrique, et ejus naturae, hoc 
est, ejus indoli et genio; ex illis vitam sibi formavit ac, ut ita dicatur, animam, quae talis [est] post mortem; sed bona nusquam commiscentur ita cum malis et mala cum bonis quin separari possint; 
si enim commiscerentur, periret homo in aeternum; hoc providet Dominus; cum homo in aeternum vitam venit, si in bonis amoris et charitatis vixit, tunc separat Dominus mala, et per bona apud eum elevat 
illum in caelum: si autem in malis vixit, nempe in contrariis amori et charitati, tunc separat Dominus bona ab illo, et mala eum ferunt in infernum; talis est sors cujusvis post mortem; sed est separatio, 
nusquam plenaria ablatio.  [3] Praeterea etiam, quia voluntas hominis quae est altera pars vitae ejus, prorsus deperdita est, separat Dominus partem illam deperditam a parte altera quae intellectualis 
ejus, et in hoc bonum charitatis et per hoc novam voluntatem, apud illos qui regenerantur, implantat; hi sunt qui conscientiam habent; sic etiam Dominus in communi separat malum a bono: haec sunt 
arcana quae in sensu interno intellecta sunt per quod bonum non possit mori quia malum inde separari potest. </p>
