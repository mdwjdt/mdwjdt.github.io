<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5117节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5117.</strong>“结出串串成熟的葡萄”表属灵真理与属天良善的结合。这从“成熟”、“串串”和“葡萄”的含义清楚可知：“成熟”是指重生或再生，直到真理与良善结合的过程，因而是指这二者的结合；“串串”是指属灵良善的真理；“葡萄”是指属天真理的良善；在此是指诸如存在于“酒政”所代表的感官层里面的这二者。它们在感官层中的结合好比一挂一挂成熟的葡萄；因为在重生或再生的过程中，一切真理都倾向于与良善的结合。在这种结合之前，真理并未接受生命，故不会结出果实。这一阶段就以正在成熟的树之果实来代表。真理仍占主导时的状态以此处被称为“串串”的未成熟葡萄来代表，而良善占主导时的状态则以此处被称为“葡萄”的成熟葡萄来代表。良善的这种主导地位还以成熟葡萄中所感知到的风味和甜蜜来代表。不过，至于真理与良善在感官层里面的结合，我们无法给出进一步的细节，因为它们都是些过于深奥，以至于任何人都难以理解的秘密。首先，有必要对属天-属灵层和感官层，以及真理与良善在其中进行结合的属世层的状态有一个透彻的了解。<br />“葡萄”表示属灵人的良善，因而表示仁爱。这一点从圣言中的许多经文可以看出来，如以赛亚书：<br />我所亲爱的有葡萄园在肥美的山冈上；他指望它结好葡萄，反倒结了野葡萄。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.1.htm">5:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.4.htm">4</a>）<br />“葡萄园”表示属灵教会；“他指望它结好葡萄”表示仁爱的善行；“反倒结了野葡萄”表示仇恨和报复的恶行。<br /><br />耶和华如此说，串串葡萄中寻得新酒，人就说，不要毁它，因为福在其中。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.8.htm">65:8</a>）<br />“串串葡萄中的新酒”表示从属世层里面的良善所获得真理。<br />耶利米书：<br />耶和华说，我要结集他们；葡萄树上必没有葡萄，无花果树上必没有无花果。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶8.13.htm">8:13</a>）<br />“葡萄树上必没有葡萄”表示没有任何内层或理性良善存在，“无花果树上必没有无花果”表示没有任何外层或属世良善存在；因为“葡萄树”表示理解力部分，如刚才所示（<a href="5113.htm">5113</a>节）；当真理与良善在其中结合时，“葡萄树”表示理性层，因为理性层因那结合而存在。“无花果树”表示属世人或外在人的良善（参看<a href="217.htm">217</a>节）。<br />何西阿书：<br />我发现以色列，如在旷野的葡萄；我看见你们的列祖如起初无花果树上初熟的果子。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何9.10.htm">9:10</a>）<br />“旷野的葡萄”表示尚未变得属灵的理性良善；“无花果树上初熟的果子”以同样的方式表示属世良善。“以色列”表示初始时的古代属灵教会，“列祖”在此和在其它地方不是指雅各的儿子，而是指古教会最初建立在其中的那些人。<br />弥迦书：<br />没有一挂可吃的。我的灵魂渴想初熟的果子。地上虔诚人灭尽，人间没有正直人。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥7.1.htm">7:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥7.2.htm">2</a>）<br />“可吃的一挂”表示初始的仁之良善；“初熟的果子”表示那时的信之真理。<br />阿摩司书：<br />看哪，日子将到，耕种的必接续收割的，踹葡萄的必接续撒种的。大山必滴下新酒，小山必融化。我必使我民被掳的归回，他们必重修荒废的城邑，住在其中；栽种葡萄园，喝其中所出的酒；修造果木园，吃其中的果子。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩9.13.htm">9:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩9.14.htm">14</a>）<br />这论及属灵教会的建立，它被如此描述。“耕种的必接续收割的”这句话预言了属灵良善与其真理的结合；“踹葡萄的必接续撒种的”这句话则预言了属灵真理与其良善的结合；“大山必滴下新酒，小山必融化”表示由这种结合产生的爱与仁之善行；“使我民被掳的归回”表示从虚假当中解救出来；“重修荒废的城邑”表示纠正虚假的真理教义；“住在其中，栽种葡萄园”表示发展那些构成属灵教会的事物；“喝其中所出的酒”表示将该教会的真理变成自己的，这些真理教导仁爱；“修造果木园，吃其中的果子”表示将源于这些的良善变成自己的。谁都能看出，“重修城邑”、“栽种葡萄园”、“喝酒”、“修造果木园”、“吃其中的果子”若非包含灵义，纯粹是在描述其中毫无神性之物的属世活动。<br />摩西五经：<br />他在葡萄酒中洗了衣服，在血红葡萄汁中洗了袍褂。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.11.htm">49:11</a>）<br />这论及主；“葡萄酒”表示源于神性之爱的属灵良善；“血红葡萄汁”表示源于神性之爱的属天良善。<br /><br />牛的奶油、羊的奶、羊羔的脂油、巴珊所出的公绵羊和山羊，与上好的麦子，也喝血红葡萄汁酿的酒。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.14.htm">32:14</a>）<br />这论及古教会，其爱与仁之良善被如此描述。每种具体产物都表示某种特定良善。“血红葡萄汁”表示属灵-属天的良善，在天上，从主发出的神性就被称为“血红葡萄汁”。葡萄酒之所以也被称为“血红葡萄汁”，是因为葡萄酒和血都表示从主发出的神圣真理；不过，“葡萄酒”论及属灵真理，“血”论及属天教会；由于同样的原因，圣餐也规定用葡萄酒。<br /><br />他们的葡萄树是所多玛的葡萄树，蛾摩拉田园所生的。他们的葡萄是毒葡萄，他们那一挂一挂都是苦的。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.32.htm">32:32</a>）<br />这论及犹太教会。“他们的葡萄树是所多玛的葡萄树，蛾摩拉田园所生的”表示这一事实：理解力部分被为地狱之爱产物的虚假所占据；“他们的葡萄是毒葡萄，他们那一挂一挂都是苦的”表示这一事实：意愿部分陷入同样的困境。事实上，“葡萄”因在正面意义上表示仁爱，故论及意愿部分，不过是理解力部分里面的意愿部分；这同样适用于反面意义，因为一切真理本质上属于理解力，一切良善本质上属于意愿。<br />启示录：<br />一位天使说，伸出快镰刀来收取地上串串的果子，因为葡萄熟透了。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.18.htm">14:18</a>）<br />“收取地上串串的果子”表示摧毁仁爱的一切存在。<br />马太福音：<br />凭着他们的果子，就可以认出他们来。荆棘上岂能摘葡萄呢？蒺藜里岂能摘无花果呢？（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.16.htm">7:16</a>）<br />路加福音：<br />凡树木凭它自己的果子就可以认出来。人不是从荆棘上收取无花果，也不是从蒺藜里收取葡萄。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路6.44.htm">6:44</a>）<br />此处论述的主题是对邻之仁，故经上说：“凭着他们的果子”，也就是仁爱的善行，就可以认出他们来；“葡萄”表示内在的仁爱善行，“无花果”表示外在的仁爱善行。<br />犹太教会中制定了以下律法：<br />你进了邻舍的葡萄园，可以随意吃饱了葡萄，只是不可装在器皿中。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申23.24.htm">23:24</a>）<br />这条法律意味着无论何人，当在具有不同教义和宗教的其他人当中时，他大可以学习并接受他们的仁之良善或仁爱行为，但不可以吸收它们，并将它们与自己的真理结合起来。“葡萄园”因表示教会，故描述了有教义和宗教的地方；“葡萄”表示仁爱的善行；“器皿”表示教会所拥有的真理。</p>

And the clusters thereof ripened grapes. That this signifies the conjunction of spiritual truth with celestial good, is evident from the signification of "ripening," as being the progress of rebirth 
or regeneration even to the conjunction of truth with good, and thus conjunction; and from the signification of "clusters," as being the truth of spiritual good; and from the signification of "grapes," 
as being the good of celestial truth; here both of these in that sensuous which is represented by the butler. The conjunction of these in the sensuous is similar to the ripening of clusters into grapes; 
for in the rebirth, or regeneration, all truth tends to conjunction with good, truth not receiving life previously to such conjunction, consequently not being made fruitful. This is represented in 
the fruits of trees when they are ripening. In unripe fruits, which here are the "clusters," is represented the state when truth still predominates; but in the ripe fruits, which are the "grapes," is 
represented the state when good has the predominance, the predominance of good being represented also in the flavor and sweetness which are perceived in ripe grapes. But concerning the conjunction of 
truth with good in the sensuous which is subject to the intellectual part, further particulars cannot be given, for they are secrets too deep for apprehension, and it is necessary for knowledges about 
the state of the celestial of the spiritual, and about this sensuous, to come first, and also about the state of the natural in which this conjunction comes into existence. [2] That "grapes" signify 
the good of the spiritual man, thus charity, is evident from many passages in the Word; as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     My well beloved had a vineyard in a horn of the son of oil; he looked that it should bring 
forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes (Isa. 5:1-2, 4); </p>
<p>where a "vineyard" denotes the spiritual church; his "looking that it should bring forth grapes" denotes the goods of charity; and its 
"bringing forth wild grapes" the evils of hatred and revenge. [3] Again: </p>
<p>     Thus hath said Jehovah, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it 
(Isa. 65:8); </p>
<p>the "new wine in the cluster" denotes truth from good in the natural. [4] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Gathering I will gather them, saith Jehovah; no grapes in the vine, nor figs in the fig tree 
(Jer. 8:13); </p>
<p>there being "no grapes in the vine" denotes that there is no interior or rational good, and "no figs in the fig tree" that there is no exterior or natural good; for a "vine" is the intellectual 
part (as shown just above, n. 5113); and when the conjunction of truth and good is therein, a "vine" is the rational, for the rational is thence. (That a "fig tree" is the good of the natural 
or exterior man may be seen above, n. 217.) [5] In Hosea: </p>
<p>     I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the first-ripe in the fig tree in its beginning (Hos. 9:10); </p>
<p>"grapes 
in the wilderness" denote rational good not yet made spiritual; the "first-ripe in the fig tree" denotes natural good in like manner; "Israel" denotes the ancient spiritual church in its beginning 
("fathers" in this and other passages not being the sons of Jacob, but those with whom the Ancient Church was first set up). [6] In Micah: </p>
<p>     There is no cluster to eat; my soul desired the first-ripe. 
The holy is perished out of the earth, and there is none upright among men (Micah 12:1-2); </p>
<p>the "cluster to eat" denotes the good of charity in its beginning; "the first-ripe" the truth of faith 
also at that time. [7] In Amos: </p>
<p>     Behold the days come that the ploughman shall reach the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that draweth the seed; and the mountains shall drop new wine, and 
all the hills shall melt. And I will bring back the captivity of My people, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and shall settle and plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; 
and they shall make clusters, and eat the fruit of them (Amos 9:13-14); </p>
<p>it treats here of the setting up of a spiritual church, which is thus described-the conjunction of spiritual good with its truth 
by the "ploughman reaching the reaper"; and the conjunction of spiritual truth with its good by the "treader of grapes reaching him that draweth the seed"; the goods of love and charity therefrom 
are signified by the "mountains dropping new wine and the hills melting"; "bringing back the captivity of the people" denotes deliverance from falsities; "building the waste cities" denotes rectifying 
the falsified doctrinals of truth; "inhabiting them and planting vineyards" denotes cultivating those things which are of the spiritual church; "drinking the wine thereof" appropriating the truths of 
that church which are of charity; and "making clusters and eating the fruit of them" appropriating the goods thence derived. Everyone can see that "building cities," "planting vineyards," "drinking wine," 
"making clusters," and "eating the fruit of them" are merely natural things, in which there would be nothing Divine unless they contained a spiritual sense. [8] In Moses: </p>
<p>     He hath washed his 
clothing in wine, and his covering in the blood of grapes (Gen. 49:11); </p>
<p>speaking of the Lord; "wine" denotes spiritual good from the Divine love; the "blood of grapes" celestial good therefrom. [9] 
Again: </p>
<p>     Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, with the fat of lambs and of rams the sons of Bashan, and of he-goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and the blood of the grape thou drinkest 
unmixed (Deut. 32:14); </p>
<p>speaking of the Ancient Church, whose goods of love and charity are thus described, and each expression signifies some specific good: the "blood of the grape" spiritual celestial 
good, the Divine in heaven proceeding from the Lord being so called. Wine is called the "blood of grapes" because both expressions signify holy truth proceeding from the Lord; but "wine" is predicated 
of the spiritual church, and "blood" of the celestial church, and for this reason wine was enjoined in the Holy Supper. [10] Again: </p>
<p>     Their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields 
of Gomorrah; the grapes thereof are grapes of gall, they have clusters of bitternesses (Deut. 32:32); </p>
<p>speaking of the Jewish Church, their "vine being of the vine of Sodom and of the fields of Gomorrah" 
denotes the intellectual part beset by falsities from infernal love; "the grapes thereof grapes of gall" and "their having clusters of bitternesses" denotes that it was similar with the will part 
therein. For as in a good sense a "grape" signifies charity, it is predicated of the will part, but of the will part within the intellectual part; and similarly in the opposite sense, because all truth 
is of the understanding and all good is of the will. [11] In Revelation: </p>
<p>     The angel said, Put forth thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripe (Rev. 
14:18); </p>
<p>"to gather the clusters of the earth" denotes to destroy all things of charity. [12] In Matthew: </p>
<p>     By their fruits ye shall know them. Do they gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? 
(Matt. 7:16). And in Luke: </p>
<p>     Every tree is known by its own fruit. For of thorns they do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush do they gather the grape (Luke 6:44). As charity toward the neighbor 
is treated of in these passages, it is said that they should be "known by their fruits" which are the goods of charity; the internal goods of charity being "grapes" and the external "figs." [13] 
The law enacted in the Jewish Church: </p>
<p>     When thou comest into thy companion's vineyard, then thou mayest eat grapes according to thy soul, to thy fill; but thou shalt not put any in thy vessel 
(Deut. 23:24); </p>
<p>involves that everyone associating with others who are in a different doctrine and religion may learn and accept their goods of charity, but may not become imbued with them and conjoin 
them with his own truths. As a "vineyard" denotes the church, it denotes where there is doctrine or religion; "grapes" are the goods of charity; and a "vessel" is the truth of the church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5117</b></p><p><b>5117.</b>
'And its clusters ripened into grapes' means spiritual truth when joined to celestial good. This is clear from the meaning of 'ripening' as the advancement of rebirth or regeneration even to the point 
where truth is joined to good, and so the two are joined together; and from the meaning of 'clusters' as the truth of spiritual good, and 'grapes' as the good of celestial truth; in this instance both 
of these as they exist within the sensory awareness represented by 'the cupbearer' is meant. The joining together of them within that sensory awareness may be likened to the ripening of clusters into 
grapes, for in rebirth or regeneration every truth aims to become joined to good. At first truth is unreceptive of life and is not therefore fruitful. This stage is represented in the fruits of trees 
while they are ripening. In unripe fruit, called 'clusters' here, that state when truth is still predominant is represented, whereas in ripe fruit, called 'grapes' here, the state when good has predominance 
is represented. This predominance of good is also represented in the flavour and the sweetness that one finds in ripe grapes. But regarding the joining together of truth and good within the 
sensory awareness subject to the understanding part, nothing more can be said as these are arcana too deep for anyone to understand. First of all one needs to have a thorough knowledge of the state of 
the celestial-spiritual and of sensory awareness, and also of the state of the natural in which that joining together of truth and good takes place. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 'Grapes' means the good of the spiritual man, 
and so means charity. This may be seen from many places in the Word, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
My beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> He looked for it to yield grapes, but it yielded wild grapes. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%205:1,%202,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 5:1, 2, 4</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'A vineyard' stands for the spiritual Church; 'he looked for it to yield grapes' for the good deeds of charity; 'but it yielded wild grapes' for the bad deeds of hatred and revenge. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said Jehovah, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one says, Do not destroy it, for there is a blessing in it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2065:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 65:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The new wine in the cluster' 
stands for truth obtained from good within the natural. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will surely gather them, says Jehovah; there will be no grapes on the vine, and no figs on the fig tree. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%208:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 8:13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'No 
grapes on the vine' stands for the non-existence of any interior or rational good, 'no figs on the fig tree' for the non-existence of any exterior or natural good; for 'the vine' means the understanding 
part, as shown just above in <a href="5113.htm">5113</a>. When truth and good exist joined together there, 'the vine' means the rational, for the rational exists as a result of that joining together. As regards 'the 
fig' meaning the good of the natural or exterior man, see <a href="217.htm">217</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
Like grapes in the wilderness I found Israel, like the first fruit on the fig tree, in its beginning, I saw your 
fathers. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%209:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 9:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Grapes in the wilderness' stands for rational good not yet made spiritual; 'the first fruit on the fig tree' in a similar way for natural good. 'Israel' stands for the ancient 
spiritual Church when it first began, 'fathers' here and elsewhere being not the sons of Jacob but those people among whom the Ancient Church was first established. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In Micah, </p>
<blockquote>
There was no cluster 
to eat; my soul desired the first fruit. The holy man has perished from the earth, and there is none upright among men. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Micah%207:1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Micah 7:1, 2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Cluster to eat' stands for the good of charity in its first 
beginnings, 'the first fruit' for the truth of faith at the same stage also.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 In Amos, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, the days are coming, so that the ploughman catches up with the reaper, and the treader of 
grapes with him who sows seed. The mountains will drip new wine, and all the hills will flow down with it. And I will bring again the captivity of My people, in order that they may build the devastated 
cities, and may settle down and plant vineyards, and may drink their wine, and make gardens and eat their fruit. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%209:13,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 9:13, 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the establishment of the spiritual Church, which is 
described in this manner. The joining of spiritual good to its truth is foretold by the statement that the ploughman will catch up with the reaper, and the joining of spiritual truth to its good by the 
statement that the treader of grapes will catch up with the one who sows seed. The good deeds of love and charity resulting from that joining together are meant by the statement that the mountains will 
drip new wine and the hills will flow down with it. 'Bringing again the captivity of the people stands for deliverance from falsities, 'building the devastated cities' for the correction of falsified 
teachings regarding the truth, 'settling down and planting vineyards' for a development of what constitutes the spiritual Church, 'drinking their wine' for making the truths of that Church one's own, 
which truths teach about charity, and 'making gardens and eating their fruit' for making one's own the forms of good derived from these. Anyone can see that building cities, planting vineyards, drinking 
wine, making gardens and eating their fruit are descriptions of merely natural activities, which but for the spiritual sense would hold nothing Divine within them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
He washes 
his clothing in wine, and his garment in the blood of grapes. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2049:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 49:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord. 'Wine' stands for spiritual good originating in Divine love, 'the blood of grapes' for celestial 
good originating in the same. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
Butter from the herd, and milk from the flock, with the fat of lambs and of rams, the breed<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> of Bashan, and of goats, with kidney-fat of wheat; 
and of the blood of the grape you drink unmixed wine. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2032:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 32:14</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Ancient Church whose good deeds of love and charity are described in this manner. Each particular product 
referred to means some specific kind of good. 'The blood of the grape' means spiritual-celestial good, the expression used for the Divine in heaven, coming forth from the Lord. Wine is also called 'the 
blood' of grapes because wine and blood mean holy truth coming forth from the Lord, though 'wine' is used in reference to the spiritual Church and 'blood' to the celestial Church. For the same reason 
wine has also been prescribed in the Holy Supper. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[10]</b>
 In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
From the vine of Sodom comes their vine, and from the fields of Gomorrah; its grapes are grapes of poison, they have 
clusters of bitterness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2032:32&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 32:32</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Jewish Church. 'From the vine of Sodom comes their vine, and from the fields of Gomorrah' stands for the fact that the understanding part is 
occupied by falsities that are the product of hellish love. 'Its grapes are grapes of poison, they have clusters of bitterness' stands for the fact that the will part is in the same predicament; for 
as 'the grape' in the good sense means charity, it is therefore used in reference to the will part, though to the will present within the understanding part. The same is true in the contrary sense, for 
all truth belongs essentially to the understanding, and all good essentially to the will. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[11]</b>
 In John, </p>
<blockquote>
The angel said, Put in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the earth, for its grapes 
have ripened. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2014:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 14:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Gathering the clusters of the earth' stands for destroying all existence of charity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[12]</b>
 In Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
By their fruits you will know them. Do people gather grapes

<p>And in Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
Every tree is known by its own fruit; for people do not collect figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble-bush. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%206:44&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 6:44</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The subject here being charity towards the neighbour, it is said that they will be recognized 'by their fruits', which are the good deeds of charity. Internal good deeds of charity are 
meant by 'grapes', external ones by 'figs'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[13]</b>
 The law was laid down in the Jewish Church, </p>
<blockquote>
When you enter your companion's vineyard you shall eat grapes at your pleasure until you have had enough;<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> 
but you shall not put them into your vessel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2013:24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 13:24</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This law implies that when anyone is among others whose teachings and religion are different from his own, he is free to learn about 
and welcome their charitable deeds, but he is not free to adopt the same charitable practices and link them into his own truths. 'A vineyard', meaning the Church, describes a place where teaching or 
religion exists; 'grapes' means the good deeds of charity, 'vessel' the truth that the Church possesses.

`Et maturuerunt botri illius uvas': quod significet conjunctionem veri spiritualis cum bono caelesti, constat ex significatione `maturescere' quod sit renascentiae seu regenerationis progressus usque 
ad conjunctionem veri cum bono, ita conjunctio; ex significatione `botrorum' quod sint verum boni spiritualis, et `uvarum' quod sint bonum veri caelestis, hic utrumque in sensuali quod per `pincernam' 
repraesentatur, conjunctio eorum in sensuali similiter se habet sicut maturitio botrorum in uvas; in renascentia enim seu regeneratione tendit omne verum ad conjunctionem cum bono; prius verum 
non vitam accipit {1}, proinde non {2} fructificatur; hoc repraesentatur in arborum fructibus cum maturescunt; in immaturis qui hic sunt `botri', repraesentatur status cum (t)adhuc verum praedominatur, 
in maturis autem qui hic sunt `uvae', cum bonum praedominium habet, praedominium boni etiam repraesentatur in sapore et dulcedine quae in uvis maturis percipiuntur.  Sed de conjunctione veri 
cum bono in sensuali parti intellectuali subjecto non plura dici possunt, sunt arcaniora quam ut capi queant; praecedent omnino cognitiones {3} de statu caelestis spiritualis, et de sensuali hoc, 
tum de statu naturalis in quo conjunctio illa existit.  [2] Quod `uvae' significent bonum spiritualis hominis, ita charitatem, constare potest a pluribus locis in Verbo, ut apud Esaiam, </p>
<p>     
     Vinea fuit dilecto Meo in cornu filii olei,...      exspectavit ut faceret uvas, sed fecit labruscas, v 1, 2,      4; </p>
<p> `vinea' pro Ecclesia spirituali {4}; `exspectavit ut faceret uvas' pro 
bona charitatis, `sed fecit labruscas' pro mala odii et vindictae: [3] apud eundem, </p>
<p>          Sic dixit Jehovah, Quemadmodum invenitur mustum in      botro, et dicit, Ne corrumpe illud, quia benedictio 
in      illo, lxv 8; </p>
<p> `mustum in botro' pro vero ex bono in naturali: [4] apud Jeremiam, </p>
<p>          Colligendo colligam eos, dictum Jehovae, non uvae in      vite, et non ficus in ficu, viii 
13; </p>
<p> `non uvae in vite' pro quod non bonum interius seu rationale, `non ficus in ficu' pro quod non bonum exterius seu naturale; `vitis' enim est intellectuale, ut mox supra n. 5113 ostensum; 
cum ibi conjunctio veri et boni, est `vitis' rationale, nam inde est rationale;(n) (o)quod `ficus' sit bonum naturalis seu exterioris hominis, videatur n. 217: [5] apud Hosheam, </p>
<p>          Sicut 
uvas in deserto inveni Israelem, sicut      primitivum in ficu in initio ejus vidi patres vestros, ix      10; </p>
<p> `uvae in deserto' pro bono rationali nondum spirituali facto, `primitivum in ficu' 
pro bono naturali similiter; `Israel' pro Ecclesia spirituali Antiqua in suo initio, `patres' hic et alibi non sunt filii Jacobi, sed sunt illi apud quos Ecclesia Antiqua primum instaurata fuit: [6] 
apud Micham, </p>
<p>          Non {5} botrus ad comedendum, primitivum desideravit      anima mea; periit sanctus e terra, et rectus inter      hominem non, vii 1, [2]; </p>
<p> `botrus ad comedendum' pro bono 
charitatis in suo initio, `primitivum' pro vero fidei etiam tunc: apud Amos, </p>
<p>          Ecce dies venientes,... ut attingat arans metentem,      et calcans uvas trahentem semen: [et stillabunt 
montes      mustum, et omnes colles diffluent:] et reducam      captivitatem populi Mei,... ut aedificent urbs devastata,      et sedeant et plantent vineas, et bibant vinum illarum,      et faciant 
hortos {6}, et comedant fructum eorum, ix 13,      14,; </p>
<p>agitur ibi de instauratione Ecclesiae spiritualis, quae ita describitur, (m)conjunctio boni spiritualis cum vero ejus {7} per quod `attinget 
arans metentem', et  conjunctio veri spiritualis cum bono ejus per quod `attinget calcans uvas trahentem semen'; {8} bona amoris et charitatis inde, significantur per quod `montes stillabunt mustum 
et colles diffluent' ;(n) `reducere  captivitatem  populi'  pro  liberare  a  falsis, `aedificare urbes devastatas' pro doctrinalia veri falsificata rectificare, `sedere et plantare vineas' pro 
excolere illa quae sunt Ecclesiae spiritualis, `bibere vinum earum' pro appropriare vera illius Ecclesiae quae sunt charitatis, et `facere {9}hortos et comedere fructum eorum' pro appropriare bona 
inde; (m)quisque videre potest quod aedificare urbes, plantare vineas, bibere vinum, facere {9}hortos et comedere fructum eorum, {10}sint mere naturalia, in quibus nisi sensus spiritualis sit, nihil 
Divinum foret inibi:(n) apud Mosen,              [8] Lavit in vino indumentum, et in sanguine uvarum velamen           suum, Gen. xlix (x)11;  ibi de Domino, `vinum' pro bono spirituali ex amore 
Divino, `sanguis uvarum' pro bono caelesti inde: apud eundem,        [9] Butyrum armenti, et lac gregis, cum adipe agnorum et           arietum filiorum Bashanis, et hircorum cum adipe renum    
         tritici, et sanguinem uvae bibis, merum, Deut. xxxii 14; </p>
<p>ibi de Ecclesia Antiqua cujus bona amoris et charitatis ita describuntur; singula significant aliquod bonum in specie; `sanguis uvae' 
bonum spirituale caeleste, ita vocatur Divinum in caelo procedens a Domino; vinum {11}appellatur `sanguis uvarum' quia utrumque significat sanctum verum procedens a Domino, at `vinum' praedicatur 
de Ecclesia spirituali, et `sanguis' de Ecclesia caelesti; et quia ita, in Sancta Cena vinum mandatum est:  apud eundem,       De vite Sodomae vitis eorum, et de agris Amorrhae; uvae ejus      
uvae fellis, botri amaritudinum illis, Deut. xxxii 32;  ibi de Ecclesia Judaica, `de vite Sodomae vitis eorum et de agris Amorrhae' pro quod intellectualis pars falsis ex amore infernali obsessa; `uvae 
ejus uvae fellis, botri amaritudinum illis' pro quod voluntarium {12}ibi simile; `uva' enim quia in bono sensu significat charitatem, inde praedicatur de voluntario, sed de voluntario {13} in 
parte intellectuali; in opposito sensu similiter, nam omne verum est intellectus, et omne bonum est voluntatis:  [11] apud Johannem,      Angelus dixit, Mitte falcem acutam, et vindemia botros terrae,  
    quia maturuerunt uvae ejus, Apoc. xiv 18; </p>
<p>[12] `vindemiare botros terrae' pro destruere omnia charitatis:  apud Matthaeum,      A fructibus eorum cognoscetis eos; numquid colligunt de spinis  
    uvas, et de tribulis ficus?  vii 16: </p>
<p>et apud Lucam,      Omnis arbor ex proprio fructu cognoscitur, non enim ex spinis      colligunt ficus, neque ex rubo vindemiant uvam, vi 44; </p>
<p>quia ibi 
de charitate erga proximum agitur, dicitur quod `ex fructibus', qui sunt bona charitatis, cognoscentur; bona charitatis interna sunt `uvae', et externa sunt `ficus' {14}. Quod lex in Ecclesia Judaica 
lata sit,      Cum veneris in vineam socii tui, comedes uvas juxta animam      tuam, ad satietatem tuam, sed in vas tuum non dabis, Deut.      xxiii 25, involvit quod quisque apud alios qui in 
alia doctrina et religione sunt, addiscere et acceptare possit charitatis eorum bona, sed non imbuere illa et conjungere suis veris; `vinea' quia est Ecclesia, est ubi doctrina seu religio; `uvae' 
sunt bona charitatis; `vas' est verum Ecclesiae. @1 accepit$ @2 nec$ @3 cogitationes I$ @4 i n. 1069$ @5 Num AI$ @6 See p. 681, note 3$ @7 et veri cum bono$ @8 i ac$ @9 botros AI. Heb is
