<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2540节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2540.</strong>“亚比米勒清晨很早就起来”表清晰的直觉，和属天良善所流出的确认之光。这从“清晨起来”、“亚比米勒”，以及“很早”的含义清楚可知。“清晨”的含义在前面早已说明（<a href="2333.htm">2333</a>，<a href="2405.htm">2405</a>节）。显然，它在此是指清晰的直觉，这从整个思路也能看出来：即这直觉起初是模糊的（<a href="2513.htm">2513</a>，<a href="2514.htm">2514</a>节）；后来它不那么模糊了（<a href="2528.htm">2528</a>节）。“亚比米勒”表关注理性事物的信之教义（<a href="2509.htm">2509</a>，<a href="2510.htm">2510</a>节）。从“清晨”的含义明显可知“很早”表示什么。由于此处经上说他“清晨很早就起来”，故这句话不仅表清晰的直觉，还表属天良善所流出的确认之光；因为真理的确认之光就源于属天的良善。所有这一切表明所表示的是这类事物。<br />主处于人身时所拥有的直觉，和祂对信之教义中的理性事物的思维在内义上有大量论述，其原因如前所述。另一个原因是，天使对以下这些事的思维方式是不同的：即主在世时生命的各个方面，祂如何脱去人类理性，并凭自己的力量使其变成神性，同时还有仁与信的教义在与理性混合时的性质，此外还有仰赖这些的更多其它事，它们都是教会和人的内在事物。对于心思意念都扑在世俗、肉体事物上的世人来说，这些事似乎无足轻重，或许对他没有任何好处；而对于心思意念都扑在属天和属灵之物上的天使来说，同样是这些事，却弥足珍贵。天使对它们的观念和直觉是无法形容的。由此明显可知，很多事因超出人的理解而在人看来无足轻重，却被天使视为最高价值，因为它们进入了天使的智慧之光；反过来，一些事因是世俗的，并由此在人的理解范围内而被人视为最高价值，但在天使看来却无足轻重，因为这些事远离他们的智慧之光。就圣言的内义而言，天使和世人之间的这种区别在很多地方出现过。</p>

Abimelech rose early in the morning. That this signifies clear perception, and the light of confirmation from celestial good, is evident from the signification of "rising in the morning," also of "Abimelech," 
and also of "early." What "morning" signifies has been shown above (n. 2333, 2405): that it is here clear perception is manifest in itself, as well as from the series; that the perception was 
at first obscure (n. 2513, 2514); and that afterwards it was less obscure (n. 2528). That "Abimelech" signifies the doctrine of faith looking to rational things, may be seen above (n. 2509, 2510); and 
what "early" signifies is manifest from the signification of "morning." As it is here said that he "rose early in the morning," this not only signifies clear perception, but also the light of confirmation 
from celestial good; for it is celestial good from which comes the confirming light of truth; all of which shows that this is the signification. [2] The reason why the perception which the Lord 
had when in the Human, and His thought concerning what is rational in the doctrine of faith, are so much treated of in the internal sense, is that which has been stated above; as well as that it is 
angelic to think with distinctiveness of various things concerning the Lord's life in the world, and how He put off the human rational, and made the rational Divine from His own power; and at the same 
time concerning the doctrine of charity and faith, such as it is when the rational mixes itself with it; besides many more things dependent on these, which are interior things of the church and of man. 
To the man whose mind and heart are set upon worldly and corporeal things, these things appear as unimportant, and perchance as of no advantage to him; yet to the angels, whose minds and hearts are 
set upon celestial and spiritual things, these same things are precious; and their ideas and perceptions respecting them are ineffable. This shows that very many things which seem unimportant to man, 
because they transcend his comprehension, are held in the highest estimation by the angels, because they enter into the light of their wisdom; and on the other hand, things that are most highly esteemed 
by man, because they are of the world, and therefore come within his comprehension, are unimportant to the angels, for they pass outside of the light of their wisdom. And such is the case with the 
internal sense of the Word, relatively to angels and to men, in many places. </p>

That 'in the morning Abimelech rose up early' means a clear perception and confirmatory light flowing from celestial good is clear from the meaning of 'rising in the morning', also of 'Abimelech', as 
well as of 'early'. What 'the morning' means has been shown in <a href="2333.htm">2333</a>, <a href="2405.htm">2405</a>. From these meanings - and also from the whole train of thought, which is that at first the Lord's perception was obscure, <a href="2513.htm">2513</a>, <a href="2514.htm">2514</a>, and after that less obscure, <a href="2528.htm">2528</a> - it is evident that here a clear perception is meant. As for 'Abimelech' - that he means the doctrine of faith which has regard to rational things - see above 
<a href="2509.htm">2509</a>, <a href="2510.htm">2510</a>. And what 'in the early morning' means is evident from the meaning of 'the morning'. Here, since it is said that 'he rose up in the morning- in the early morning', not only a clear perception 
is meant but also confirmatory light flowing from celestial good; for celestial good is the source from which the confirmatory light of truth is derived. These considerations now show that such 
things are meant. </p>

 The reason why the perception which the Lord had when He was in the Human, and why His thought concerning that which was rational with the doctrine of faith, are dealt with so 
extensively in the internal sense is that stated above. A further reason is that it is angel-like to think in a distinct manner about the various aspects of the Lord's life in the world, and about how 
He cast off the human rational and by His own power made it Divine, and at the same time to think about the nature of the doctrine of charity and faith when the rational mixes with it, besides many 
more things dependent on these, which are interior features of the Church and of man. To anyone whose heart and mind are set on worldly and bodily interests, such matters seem of little importance, and 
perhaps of no advantage to him; whereas to angels whose hearts and minds are set on celestial and spiritual interests, those same matters are precious. Their ideas and perceptions regarding them are 
beyond description. From this it is evident that very many matters which to man are of little importance because they are above and beyond his grasp of things are to angels of the highest worth since 
those matters come within the light of their wisdom; and conversely, the matters of highest worth to man, because they are worldly and so come within his grasp of things, are to angels of little importance 
since those matters go on away from the light of angels' wisdom. This difference between angels and men with regard to the internal sense of the Word occurs in many places. </p>

`Mane surrexit Abimelech in matutino': quod significet perceptionem claram et confirmationis lucem ex caelesti bono, constat (c)a significatione `mane surgere,' tum `Abimelechi,' ut et `matutini'; quid 
`mane' significat, ostensum est n. 2333, 2405, hic quod perceptionem claram, patet inde, tum a serie quod perceptio primum fuerit obscura, n. 2513, 2514, ac dein quod minus obscura, n. 2528; quid 
`Abimelech,' quod significet doctrinam fidei spectantem rationalia, videatur supra n. 2509, 2510; et quid `matutinum,' patet a significatione `mane'; hic quia dicitur `(t)surrexit mane in matutino,' non 
modo significat perceptionem claram, sed etiam confirmationis lucem a caelesti bono; est enim caeleste bonum ex quo lux veri confirmans; inde nunc constare potest quod illa significentur.  [2] Quod 
tantum in sensu interno agitur de perceptione quae Domino cum in Humano fuit, ac de cogitatione de rationali in doctrina fidei, est causa quae supra quoque dicta, tum quod angelicum sit distincte varia 
cogitare de vita Domini in mundo, et quomodo exuerit rationale humanum, et id Divinum ex propria potentia fecerit; ac simul de doctrina charitatis et fidei qualis est cum rationale se immiscet, praeter 
plura quae interiora Ecclesiae et hominis sunt, et inde dependent; haec homini cui curae et cordi mundana et corporea, apparent sicut levia, et fortassis sicut ad nihilum ei conducentia, at eadem 
haec angelis quibus curae et cordi caelestia et spiritualia, sunt pretiosa; eorum ideae et perceptiones de his ineffabiles sunt: inde patet quod plurima quae levia sunt homini quia captum ejus transcendunt, 
sint aestimatissima angelis, qui intrant in lucem eorum sapientiae; et vicissim, quae aestimatissima homini, quia mundana ac ita intrant in {1} captum ejus, levia sint angeli' egrediuntur enim 
e luce sapientiae eorum: sensus internus Verbi se habet respective ita multis in locis. 	@1 intra.$ </p>
