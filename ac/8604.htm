<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8604节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8604.</strong>“于是摩西何时举手”表当那些属于属灵教会之人的信仰望主时。这从“摩西”的代表和“举手”的含义清楚可知：“摩西”是指神之真理，如前面频繁所述；“举手”是指向上，因而向主的属灵能力。“手”是指属灵能力（参看<a href="6947.htm">6947</a>，<a href="7011.htm">7011</a>节）；并且它因是属灵能力，故是信；因为在灵界，一切能力，就是对抗虚假和邪恶的一切能力都属于从良善所获得的真理，或说从仁所获得的信（<a href="3563.htm">3563</a>，<a href="4931.htm">4931</a>节）。<br />何为看向主，何为看向世界和自我，因而何为在自我之上观看，何为在自我之下观看，可见于前文（参看<a href="7814.htm">7814</a>-<a href="7821.htm">7821</a>节），即：在自我之上观看就是看向邻舍、我们的国家、教会、天堂，因而看向主（<a href="7814.htm">7814</a>，<a href="7815.htm">7815</a>，<a href="7817.htm">7817</a>节）；在自我之下观看就是看向世界和自我（<a href="7817.htm">7817</a>节）；在自我之上和自我之下观念意味着以某种事物为目的，并爱之胜过一切（<a href="7818.htm">7818</a>节）；人与野兽的区别在于，他能自我之上或自我之下观看；当在自我之上观看时，他就是一个人，但当在自我之下观看时，他就是一个野兽（参看<a href="7821.htm">7821</a>节）；在自我之上观看就是被主提升到更高层（<a href="7816.htm">7816</a>节）。对每个人来说，主通过从祂自己发出的真理而流入，由此给人带来生命，因为来自主的光是神性真理，是生命（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.4.htm">1:4</a>）。<br />来自主的这神性真理流入与人同住的良善，通过良善将此人吸引到自己这里。事实上，来自主的生命拥有一种吸引力，因为它源于爱，而一切爱都含有这种吸引力，以致它渴望与别人联结，好叫它们能合而为一。因此，当一个人处于良善，并通过良善处于真理时，他就被主吸引，与祂结合。这就是“仰望主”的意思。但当一个人没有处于良善，因而也没有通过良善处于真理时，他也被主吸引，但无法被提升，因为邪恶和由此产生的虚假厌恶、远离祂。这就是“向下看，或看向自我和世界”的意思。<br />主将人吸引到自己这里，主自己在约翰福音中教导了这一真理：<br />至于我，我若从地上被举起来，就要吸引众人来归向我自己。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.32.htm">12:32</a>）<br />由此可见当如何理解这一解释：当信仰望主时，进行争战的真理就获胜；当信转离主俯视自我和世界时，虚假就获胜，这就是这句话，即当摩西举手时，以色列就得胜，当摩西垂手时，亚玛力就得胜的意思。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8604</b></p><p><b>8604.</b>
And it was when Moses lifted up his hand. That this signifies when the faith looked toward the Lord, with those who were of the spiritual church, is evident from the representation of Moses, as being 
truth Divine (of which frequently above); and from the signification of "lifting up the hand," as being to determine the spiritual power upward, thus to the Lord. That "the hand" denotes spiritual power, 
see n. 6947, 7011; and because it denotes spiritual power it denotes faith; for all power in the spiritual world (that is, against falsities from evil) belongs to truth from good, or to faith from 
charity (n. 3563, 4932). [2] What it is to look toward the Lord, and what it is to look toward the world and self; thus what it is to look above self, and what to look below self (see n. 7814-7821); 
namely, that to look above self is to look to the neighbor, to our country, to the church, to heaven, thus to the Lord (n. 7814, 7815, 7817); that to look below self is to look to the world and to self 
(n. 7817); that to look above self and below self is to have as the end and to love above all things (n. 7818); that man is distinguished from brutes by the fact that he can look above self and below 
self, and that when he looks above self, he is a man, but when below self, he is a beast (see n. 7821); and that to look above self is to be elevated by the Lord (n. 7816), for the Lord flows in with 
every man through the truth which is from Himself, whereby He gives life to man, because the light which is from the Lord is Divine truth, and is life (John 1:4). [3] This Divine truth which is from 
the Lord flows into the good with man, and by means of it draws the man to itself; for the life which is from the Lord has a power of attracting, because it is from love, since all love has in it 
this power, inasmuch as it wills to be conjoined, so as to be a one. Then therefore a man is in good, and from good in truth, he is drawn by the Lord, and is conjoined with Him. This is meant by "looking 
upward to the Lord." But when a man is not in good, thus not in truth from good, then too he is drawn by the Lord, but cannot be elevated, because evils and the derivative falsities turn themselves 
away. This is meant by "looking downward," or "to self and the world." [4] That the Lord draws man to Himself, the Lord Himself teaches in John: </p>
<p>     I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw 
all men unto Myself (John 12:32). From all this it can now be seen how it is to be understood that when the faith looked toward the Lord, the fighting truth conquered, and that when the faith looked 
downward from the Lord to self and the world, the falsity conquered, as is signified by Israel prevailing when Moses held up his hand, and by Amalek prevailing when he let down his hand. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8604</b></p><p><b>8604.</b>
'And so it was, when Moses raised up his hand' means whenever the faith of those belonging to the spiritual Church looked towards the Lord. This is clear from the representation of 'Moses' as God's truth, 
dealt with often; and from the meaning of 'raising up one's hand' as spiritual power directed upwards, and so towards the Lord. For the meaning of 'hand' as spiritual power, see <a href="6947.htm">6947</a>, <a href="7011.htm">7011</a>; and 
being spiritual power it is faith, since all power in the spiritual world, that is, against falsities and evils, is the power of truth received from good, or of faith received from charity, <a href="3563.htm">3563</a>, <a href="4931.htm">4931</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
What looking towards the Lord is, and what looking towards the world and self is, thus what looking above self and below self is, may be seen in  <a href="7814.htm">7814</a>-7821: </p>
<p> Looking above self is looking 
towards one's neighbour, country, Church, heaven, and so towards the Lord, <a href="7814.htm">7814</a>, <a href="7815.htm">7815</a>, <a href="7817.htm">7817</a>. Looking below self is looking towards the world and self, <a href="7817.htm">7817</a>. Looking above self and below self means having 
something as one's end in view and loving it above all else, <a href="7818.htm">7818</a>. The human being is distinguished from beasts by the fact that he can look above self or below self; when he looks above self he 
is a human being, but when he looks below self he is a beast, <a href="7821.htm">7821</a>. Looking above self is being raised by the Lord to a higher level, <a href="7816.htm">7816</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
The Lord flows in with every person through the Truth 
emanating from Himself Through it He brings life to the person, for the light which comes from the Lord is Divine Truth, and is life, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:4</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 This Divine Truth coming from the Lord flows into 
the good residing with the person, and by means of it He draws the person to Himself. For life which comes from the Lord is attractive or draws others to itself because it springs from love, and all 
love holds a power of attraction because of its desire to be joined to another so that they may be one. When therefore a person is governed by good, and from good is guided by truth, he is drawn by the 
Lord to Himself and joined to Him. This is what looking upwards to the Lord is used to mean. The person who is not governed by good, and thus is not guided by truth from good, is also drawn by the 
Lord, but he cannot be raised up, because evils and resulting falsities are averse to Him. This is what looking downwards, or towards self and the world, is used to mean.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The truth that the Lord 
draws a person to Himself is His own teaching in John, </p>
<blockquote>
I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to Myself. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2012:31&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 12:31</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From all this one may now see how to understand the explanation 
that whenever faith looked towards the Lord the truth engaged in conflict would be winning, and whenever faith looked downwards, away from the Lord towards self and the world, falsity would be 
winning, which is the meaning of the statement that when Moses raised up his hand Israel prevailed, and when he let down his hand Amalek prevailed. </p>

`Et fuit, cum elevavit Moscheh manum suam': quod significet cum fides apud illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali spectaret versus Dominum, constat ex repraesentatione `Moschis' quod sit verum Divinum, de 
qua saepius, et ex significatione `elevare manum' quod sit potentiam spiritualem determinare sursum, ita ad Dominum; quod `manus' sit potentia spiritualis, videatur n. (x)6947, 7011; et quia {1} potentia 
spiritualis est fides, nam omnis potentia in spirituali mundo, hoc est, contra falsa {2}et mala, est veri ex bono, seu fidei ex charitate, n. 3563, 4931. 	2 Quid sit spectare versus Dominum, et 
quid sit spectare versus mundum et ad se, ita quid sit spectare supra se et infra se, videatur n. 7814-7821; quod nempe spectare supra se sit ad proximum, ad patriam, ad Ecclesiam, ad caelum, ita ad Dominum, 
n. 7814, 7815, 7817; quod spectare infra se sit ad mundum et ad se, n. 7817; quod spectare supra se et infra se sit pro fine habere, et supra omnia amare, n. 7818; quodque homo distinguatur a 
brutis per quod spectare possit supra se et infra se, et quod cum spectat supra se, sit homo, at cum infra se, sit bestia, n. 7821; quod spectare supra se sit elevari a Domino, n. 7816; Dominus enim influit 
apud omnem hominem per Verum quod ab Ipso; per hoc dat vitam homini, nam lux quae a Domino est 3 Divinum Verum, et est vita, Joh. i 4; Divinum hoc Verum, quod a Domino, influit in bonum apud hominem, 
et per illud trahit hominem ad Se, nam vita, quae a Domino, est attractiva, quia est {3}ex amore, omnis enim amor in se habet vim attractionis, {4}quia conjungi vult, usque ut unum sint; cum itaque 
homo est in bono, et ex bono in vero, tunc attrahitur ille a Domino, ac Ipsi conjungitur; hoc intelligitur per spectare sursum ad Dominum; at cum homo non in bono est, ita non in vero a bono, tunc 
quoque attrahitur a Domino, sed non potest elevari, nam mala et inde falsa avertunt se; hoc intelligitur per spectare deorsum, seu ad se et ad mundum; quod Dominus trahet 4 hominem ad Se, docet Ipse 
Dominus apud Johannem, Ego, si exaltatus fuero e terra, omnes traham ad Me Ipsum, xii 32; </p>
<p>ex his nunc constare potest quomodo intelligendum quod cum fides spectaret versus Dominum, verum pugnans vinceret, 
et cum fides spectaret deorsum a Domino ad se et mundum, quod tunc falsum vinceret, quae significantur {5} per quod `cum Moscheh elevavit manum, praevaleret Israel, et cum demisit manum, praevaleret
