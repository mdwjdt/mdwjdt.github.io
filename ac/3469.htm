<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3469节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3469.</strong>“以扫四十岁的时候”表在属世的真理良善上的试探状态。这从“以扫”的代表和“四十岁”的含义清楚可知：“以扫”是指属世的真理良善（<a href="3300.htm">3300</a>，<a href="3302.htm">3302</a>，<a href="3322.htm">3322</a>节）；“四十岁”是指试探的状态。“四十”表试探（参看<a href="730.htm">730</a>，<a href="862.htm">862</a>，<a href="2272.htm">2272</a>节），“岁”（或年）表状态（<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="488.htm">488</a>，<a href="493.htm">493</a>，<a href="893.htm">893</a>节）。在告知有关亚比米勒和以撒的情况后，经上紧接着补充了有关以扫的这些细节。这是因为所论述的主题一直是那些处于真理的良善之人，也就是那些照取自圣言字义的教义事物生活的人。这种人由亚比米勒、亚户撒和非各来表示，如前面各处所述。<br />因此，处于真理的良善，或照教义事物生活的人在内层，也就是他们的理性事物方面重生了，但在外层，也就是他们的属世事物方面尚未重生。因为人心智的理性部分先于属世部分重生（<a href="3286.htm">3286</a>，<a href="3288.htm">3288</a>节）。属世部分完全存在于这个世界，并且人的思维和意愿就建立在如同其根基的属世部分之上。这就是为何在重生期间，人会感觉到他的理性人，或内在人与他的属世人，或外在人之间的冲突或争战；以及其外在人的重生比内在人要晚得多，并且困难得多的原因。事实上，越接近尘世、越接近肉体的东西若不经过相当长的一段时期，通过此人被引入的许多新状态，就无法轻易受约束，以顺从内在人。这些状态就是自我认知和对主的认知的状态，也就是说，是他自己的悲惨处境和主的怜悯的状态，因而是由试探的争战所产生的谦卑的状态。正因如此，此处紧接着补充了有关以扫和他两个妻子的细节，以此在内义上表示这类事。<br />人人都知道何为属世良善，就是人生来所进入的良善，但很少有人知道何为属世的真理良善。属世良善，也就是人生来所具有的良善有四种，分别是：源于对良善之爱的属世良善；源于对真理之爱的属世良善；以及源于对邪恶之爱的属世良善；源于对虚假之爱的属世良善。人生来所具有的良善是从他的父母，要么从父亲，要么从母亲那里获得的。因为父母通过经常使用和习惯所获得的一切，也就是他们通过实际生活所充满、直到习惯成自然的一切，都会传给他们的孩子，并具有遗传性。如果父母出于对良善之爱而过一种良善的生活，并在这种生活中体验到幸福快乐，如果他们在这种状态下孕育后代，那么其后代就会从他们那里获得一种趋向类似良善的倾向。如果父母出于对真理之爱而过一种良善的生活（关于这种良善，参看<a href="3459.htm">3459</a>，<a href="3463.htm">3463</a>节），并在这种生活中体验到快乐，如果他们在这种状态下孕育后代，那么其后代就会从他们那里获得一种趋向此类良善的倾向。这同样适用于那些通过遗传接受源于对邪恶之爱的良善和源于对虚假之爱的良善之人。<br />后者之所以被称为良善，是因为这些人所行的此类良善表面上看似良善，尽管事实上它们正是良善的反面。属世良善在很多人身上很明显，他们就具有这种良善。那些具有源于对邪恶之爱的属世良善之人容易倾向于各种邪恶，因为他们会轻易让自己误入歧途。这种良善就是他们敏感，尤其对污秽的快乐、各种淫行，以及残忍敏感的根源。那些具有源于对虚假之爱的属世良善之人则倾向于各种虚假。由于这种良善，他们贪婪地学习虚假说服，尤其伪君子和骗子所用的那一类，因为这种人知道如何赢得人们的注意，骗取情感，假装无辜。如今，基督教界具有属世良善的绝大多数人就出生在这些源于邪恶或虚假的所谓良善中，因为他们的父母通过实际生活已经获得了邪恶和虚假的快乐，并以这种方式将其植入在自己的孩子里面，并因此植入在其子孙后代里面。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3469</b></p><p><b>3469.</b>
And Esau was a son of forty years. That this signifies a state of temptation as to the natural good of truth, is evident from the representation of Esau, as being the natural good of truth (n. 3300, 
3302, 3322); and from the signification of "forty years," as being states of temptation. (That "forty" signifies temptations may be seen above, n. 730, 862, 2272; and that "years" signify states, n. 487, 
488, 493, 893.) The reason why these things concerning Esau are joined to what has been related concerning Abimelech and Isaac, is that those are treated of who are in the good of truth, that is, 
who are in life according to things that are derived from the literal sense of the Word; for these are signified by "Abimelech, Ahuzzath, and Phicol," as before repeatedly said. [2] They therefore who 
are in the good of truth, or in a life according to doctrinal things, are regenerate as to the interiors, which are their rational, but not yet as to the exteriors, which are their natural things; for 
man is regenerated as to the rational before he is regenerated as to the natural (n. 3286, 3288); because the natural is altogether in the world, and in the natural as in a plane there are founded 
man's thought and will. This is the reason why during regeneration man observes a combat between his rational or internal man and his natural or external man; and why his external man is regenerated much 
later, and likewise with much greater difficulty, than his internal man. For that which is nearer to the world and nearer to the body cannot be easily constrained to render obedience to the internal 
man; but only after considerable length of time and by means of many new states into which the man is introduced, which are states of self-acknowledgment, and of acknowledgment of the Lord, that is, 
of one's own wretchedness, and of the Lord's mercy; thus states of humiliation resulting from temptation combats. Because this is so, there is here next adjoined what is said of Esau and his two wives, 
whereby such things are signified in the internal sense. [3] Everyone knows what natural good is, namely, that it is the good into which man is born; but what the natural good of truth is, is known 
to few, if any. There are four kinds of natural good, that is, of the good that is born with man, namely, natural good from the love of good, natural good from the love of truth, and also natural good 
from the love of evil, and natural good from the love of falsity. For the good into which man is born he derives from his parents, either father or mother; for all that which parents have contracted 
by frequent use and habit, or have become imbued with by actual life until it has become so familiar to them that it appears as if natural, is transmitted into their children, and becomes hereditary. 
If parents who have lived in the good of the love of good and in this life have perceived their delight and blessedness, conceive offspring in this state, the offspring receive therefrom an inclination 
to similar good; and if parents who have lived in the good of the love of truth (concerning which good see n. 3459, 3463) and in this life have perceived their delight, are in this state when they 
conceive offspring, the offspring receive therefrom an inclination to the like good.  [4] The case is similar with those who receive hereditarily the good of the love of evil and the good of the love 
of what is false. These latter are called goods by reason of their appearing in outward form as goods in those persons in whom they are, although they are the very reverse of goods. Very many in whom 
natural good appears have such good. They who are in the natural good of the love of evil are pliant and prone to evils of every kind; for they suffer themselves to be easily led astray, and from this 
good are compliant, especially to foul pleasures, to adulteries, and also to cruelties; and they who are in the natural good of falsity are prone to falsities of every kind, and from this good learn 
with avidity what is persuasive, especially from hypocrites and cunning persons, who know how to captivate the mind, to insinuate themselves into the affections, and to feign innocence. At the present 
day most people who in the Christian world are in natural good, are born into these so-called goods of evil and falsity, because their parents have by actual life contracted the delight of evil and 
of falsity, and thus have implanted it in their children, and thereby in their descendants. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3469</b></p><p><b>3469.</b>
'Esau was a son of forty years' means a state of temptation as regards the natural good of truth. This is clear from the representation of 'Esau' as natural good of truth, dealt with in <a href="3300.htm">3300</a>, <a href="3302.htm">3302</a>, <a href="3322.htm">3322</a>, 
and from the meaning of 'forty years' as a state of temptation - 'forty' meaning temptations, see <a href="730.htm">730</a>, <a href="862.htm">862</a>, <a href="2272.htm">2272</a>, and 'years' states, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="488.htm">488</a>, <a href="493.htm">493</a>, <a href="893.htm">893</a>. The reason why these details concerning Esau 
are added immediately after what has been told regarding Abimelech and Isaac is that the subject has been those who do the good of truth, that is, those who live in accordance with matters of doctrine 
drawn from the literal sense of the Word; for such people were meant by Abimelech, Ahuzzath, and Phicol, as stated above in various places. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 People therefore who do the good of truth, or who 
live in accordance with matters of doctrine, are regenerate as regards interior things, which are their rational concepts, but not yet as regards exterior, which are their natural things. For a person 
is regenerated as to the rational part of his mind before being regenerated as to the natural part, <a href="3286.htm">3286</a>, <a href="3288.htm">3288</a>. The natural exists wholly in this world, and it is on the natural as their foundation 
that the person's thought and will are based. This is the reason why, while being regenerated, a person is aware of conflict between his rational or internal man and his natural or external man, and 
why his external is regenerated much later and with far more difficulty than the internal. Indeed what is closer to the world and closer to the body cannot be easily rendered subservient to the internal 
man except over a considerable period of time and by means of very many new states into which it has to be brought. These states are states of self-recognition and of recognition of the Lord, that 
is to say, of his own miserable condition and of the Lord's mercy, and so of humiliation, through conflicts brought about by temptations. This being so, there is immediately added at this point the reference 
to Esau and his two wives, by which such things are meant in the internal sense. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 It is well known to anyone what natural good is, namely the good into which a person is born But what the 
natural good of truth is, is known to few, if anyone. There are four types of natural good, or good that one is born with. These are, natural good that stems from the love of good; natural good that 
stems from the love of truth; also natural good that stems from the love of evil; and natural good that stems from the love of falsity. A person derives the good that he is born with from his parents, 
whether from father or from mother. For every characteristic which parents have acquired from frequent practice and conduct, that is, which they have taken into themselves by their own actions in life 
until with them they have become so habitual as to appear natural, is passed on to their children and becomes hereditary. If parents have led a good life from a love of good and have experienced delight 
and blessedness in that life, and if this is their state when they conceive an offspring, their offspring acquires from them an inclination towards this same form of good. If parents have led a 
good life from a love of truth - for which good, see <a href="3459.htm">3459</a>, <a href="3463.htm">3463</a> - and have experienced delight in that life, and if this is their state when they conceive an offspring, their offspring acquires from them 
an inclination towards that same form of good. And the same applies to those who by heredity receive the good that stems from a love of evil and the good that stems from a love of falsity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
The latter are called good because the kinds of good done by them seem in outward appearance to be good, despite the fact that there is nothing good at all about them. Very many with whom natural good 
is apparent possess this type of good. Those with whom natural good that stems from love of evil is present tend and incline towards evils of every kind, for they readily allow themselves to be led astray. 
That good is the source of their susceptibility especially towards foul delights, different kinds of adultery, and also of cruelty. Those with whom natural good stemming from a love of falsity 
is present incline towards falsities of every kind. Because of that good they seize on false persuasion, especially that used by hypocrites and deceivers, who know how to win people's attention, worm 
their way into affections, and feign innocence. Into these so-called forms of good - of good that stems from evil or from falsity - the majority are born at the present day in the Christian world, in 
whom natural good exists, the reason being that their parents have acquired a delight in evil and a delight in falsity through their own actions in life, and in this way have implanted it in their children, 
and so in their descendants. </p>

`Fuit Esau filius quadraginta annorum': quod significet statum tentationis quoad bonum veri naturale, constat ex repraesentatione `Esavi' quod sit bonum veri naturale, de qua n. 3300, 3302, 3322; [et] 
ex significatione `quadraginta annorum' quod sint tentationis status; quod `quadraginta' sint tentationes, videatur n. 730, 862, 2272, et quod `anni' sint status, n. 487, 488, 493, 893. Quod haec de 
Esavo immediate {1}adjungantur illis quae de Abimelecho et Jishako relata sunt, est quia {2}actum est de illis qui in bono veri sunt, hoc est, qui in vita secundum doctrinalia ex sensu litterali Verbi 
desumpta, hi enim significati sunt per Abimelechum {3} et Ahuzzatum et Phicolem, ut supra passim dictum; [2] qui itaque in bono veri sunt, seu in vita secundum doctrinalia, regenerati sunt quoad interiora, 
quae eorum rationalia sunt, sed nondum quoad exteriora, quae eorum naturalia; homo enim prius regeneratur quoad rationale quam {4}quoad naturale, n. 3286, 3288, nam naturale prorsus in mundo 
est, et in naturali ut in plano fundatur hominis cogitatio et voluntas; (c)ea causa est quod appercipiat homo cum regeneratur, pugnam inter rationalem seu internum suum hominem et naturalem seu externum, 
et quod multo serius, et quoque multo difficilius regeneretur externum ejus quam internum; quod enim propius est mundo et propius corpori, hoc non adigi potest facile ad obsequia praestandum interno 
homini, nisi per insignem temporis moram, et per plures status novos in quos {5}introducetur, qui status sunt status {6}agnitionis sui, et agnitionis Domini, suae nempe miseriae et Domini misericordiae, 
ita humiliationis, per pugnas tentationum; quia ita est, ideo hic nunc immediate adjungitur hoc de Esavo et de ejus binis uxoribus, per quae talia in sensu interno significantur. [3] Cuivis notum 
est quid bonum naturale, quod nempe sit bonum in quod nascitur homo; sed quid bonum veri naturale, paucis si ulli notum est; datur bonum naturale, seu homini connatum, quadruplicis generis, nempe bonum 
naturale ex amore boni, bonum naturale ex amore veri, tum bonum naturale ex amore mali, et bonum naturale ex amore falsi; bonum enim in quod homo nascitur, id trahit a parentibus, sive patre sive 
matre; omne enim id quod parentes ex frequenti usu et habitu contraxerunt, seu ex actuali vita imbuerunt, usque dum illis tam familiare factum sit ut appareat sicut naturale, hoc derivatur in liberos, 
et fit hereditarium; parentes qui in bono amoris boni vixerunt, et in illa vita suum jucundum et beatum perceperunt, si in statu illo sunt cum prolem concipiunt, proles inde accipit {7}inclinationem 
ad simile bonum; parentes qui in bono amoris veri vixerunt, de quo bono videatur n. 3459, 3463, et in illa vita suum jucundum perceperunt, si in statu illo sunt cum prolem concipiunt, proles inde accipit 
inclinationem ad simile bonum; {8}consimiliter qui ex hereditario accipiunt bonum amoris mali et bonum amoris falsi; [4] vocantur haec bona, ex causa quia ut bona apud quos sunt, in externa forma 
apparent, tametsi nihil minus quam bona sunt; perplures apud quos bonum naturale apparet, tale bonum habent; qui in bono naturali amoris mali sunt, flexiles et proclives ad cujusvis generis mala sunt, 
nam facile se patiuntur seduci, ex bono illo sunt obsequiosi, cumprimis ad foedas voluptates, ad adulteria, etiam ad crudelia; et qui in bono naturali amoris falsi sunt, proclives sunt ad cujusvis generis
