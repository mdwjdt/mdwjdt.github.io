<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第698节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>698．除了地狱外，还有许多消磨（vastations），对此，圣言中讲了很多。由于人自己犯下的罪行，他会将自己所积累和招致的无数邪恶和虚假一同带入来生（灵界）。即便那些生活正直的人也是如此。在这些人被提升天堂之前，他们的邪恶与虚假必须被驱散，这种驱散就被称为消磨。消磨的方式多种多样，消磨的时间有长有短。有些人在很短的时间内就被提入天堂，有些人则死后立刻被提入天堂。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]698.</strong> In addition to hell itself, there is also a process of devastation, described at length in the Word.{*1} We take with us into the next life innumerable evils and falsities acquired from the sins we have actually committed. These we heap up and twine together, even those of us who have lived honorably. Before the honest can be lifted into heaven, their evils and falsities have to be dispelled, and this process is called devastation.<br />There are many kinds of devastation, and it can last for a longer or shorter time. Some people are taken to heaven after a very brief period, and some go immediately after death.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On devastation in the Bible, see the many passages quoted in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_698/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5376" target=_top>5376</a>, including <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_698/bible_king-james-version_psalms_40_2" target=_top>Psalms 40:2</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_698/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_6_9-13" target=_top>Isaiah 6:9-13</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_698/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_24_1-23" target=_top>24:1-23</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_698/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_51_3" target=_top>51:3</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_698/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_12_19-20" target=_top>Ezekiel 12:19-20</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_698/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_36_3-12" target=_top>36:3-12</a>.

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 698</b></p><p><b>698.</b>
Besides the hells there are also vastations, concerning which there is much in the Word. For in consequence of actual sins a man takes with him into the other life innumerable evils and falsities, which 
he accumulates and joins to himself. It is so even with those who have lived uprightly. Before these can be taken up into heaven, their evils and falsities must be dissipated, and this dissipation 
is called Vastation. There are many kinds of vastations, and longer and shorter periods of vastation. Some are taken up into heaven in a comparatively short time, and some immediately after death. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 698</b></p><p><b>698.</b>
In addition to the hells there are also vastations, about which much is stated in the Word. For a person brings with him into the next life, as the result of sins of his own doing, countless evils and 
falsities which he accumulates and couples to himself. Even people who have led upright lives do so. Before these can be raised up into heaven their evils and falsities must be dispersed, and this dispersing 
is called vastation. There are many kinds of vastation, and the time they last may be quite long or quite short. Some people are taken off to heaven within a fairly short period of time, some 
immediately after death.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 698</b>
</p><b>698.</b>
Praeter inferna, sunt etiam vastationes, de quibus multum in Verbo; homo enim trahit secum in alteram vitam ex actualibus peccatis innumera mala et falsa, coacervat illa, et copulat: qui probe vixerunt, 
similiter; hi antequam in caelum possunt elevari, eorum mala et falsa dissipanda sunt: haec dissipatio vocatur vastatio; vastationum genera sunt plura, et vastationis tempora majora et minora; quidam 
intra breviusculum tempus auferuntur in caelum, quidam statim post mortem. </p>
