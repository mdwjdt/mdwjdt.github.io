<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1271节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1271.</strong>在此之后，有些诡诈的灵人想让这些洪水前的人出来，于是激励他们说，他们什么也不是，以便他们可以偷偷溜出来。就在这时，只听见那地狱传来一阵骚乱，好象发生了大规模的起义。这场骚乱是由那些渴望挣脱出来的人引起的。因此，他们中的一些人被允许再次从那里上来，并出现在前者所在的那个地方。在那些诡诈恶魔的帮助下，他们试图从那里向我灌输其致命的信念，但没有得逞，因为我受到主的保护。然而，我能清楚觉察到他们的信念令人窒息。他们以为自己拥有至高无上的权力，能夺走任何人的生命。不过，正因他们相信自己拥有至高无上的权力，所以他们被一个小孩子推倒了，当着他的面摇摇晃晃、踉踉跄跄，以致大声哭喊说，他们极其痛苦，简直到了无以复加的地步，只能求助于祈祷。那些诡诈的恶魔也受到惩处，首先被那些获准出来的古人几乎窒息而死，然后又被紧紧绑在一起，以使他们停止这种行径。但过了一段时间，他们就被释放了。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1271.</strong> Afterward, there were some deceitful spirits that wanted [the pre-Flood people] to escape and suggested to them the idea of saying that they were completely insignificant, so that they would be allowed to climb out. I then heard the sound of upheaval in that hell, like the sound of a large, rowdy mass. It was the sound of their agitated desire to struggle free. So once more some of them were permitted to rise up, and they appeared in the same place as the earlier ones. Assisted by the deceitful fiends, they tried to pour their lethal persuasions into me from there, but it was no use, because the Lord was protecting me. Still, I could tell that their persuasive powers were capable of smothering a person.<br />They thought they could do anything and take life from anyone. But since they considered themselves all-powerful, it was a mere baby that sent them back down. The infant's presence made them stagger so violently that they cried out over the anguish they were in. Their distress was so severe that they resorted to pleading.<br />The deceivers were punished too. First they were almost smothered by [the pre-Flood people]. Later they were cemented together so that they would stop doing the kind of things they had done. In the end, though, they were set free. </p>

After this, there were certain deceitful spirits who desired that these might emerge, and inspired them to say that they were nothing, so that they might steal out. Then a tumult was heard in that hell, 
as of a great turbulent uprising, which was a commotion among those who desired to force their way out, and therefore it was again permitted that some of them should rise up, and be seen in the same 
place as the former were. From there, aided by those deceitful genii, they attempted to pour into me their deadly persuasive influence; but in vain, because I was protected by the Lord. Yet I plainly 
perceived that their persuasive influence was suffocating. They believed themselves to be all-powerful, and able to take away life from everyone. And because they believed themselves to be all-powerful, 
they were thrust down by a little child, at whose presence they tottered and faltered, so that they cried out that they were in anguish, and this so sorely that they betook themselves to supplications. 
The deceitful spirits were also punished, first being almost suffocated by the antediluvians, and then being glued together, to make them desist from such doings; but after a time they were set free. </p>

After this there were certain deceitful spirits who wanted these who had lived before the Flood to come out To enable these to steal their way out, the deceitful spirits put it into their minds to say 
that they were nothing. At that point I heard a disturbance in that hell like a great. upheaval taking place. It was the commotion caused by those who desired to break free. Once again therefore some 
of them were allowed to come up from there and they appeared in the same place as their predecessors had done. From there they tried with the help of those deceitful genii to instill their deadly persuasion 
into me. But it was all to no avail as I was being protected by the Lord. I perceived quite clearly that their persuasion was stifling. They imagined that they had power over all things and could 
deprive anyone of his life. But because they imagined that they had power over all things it took no more than a small child to thrust them down, whose presence caused them to be so unsteady that 
they cried out they were in distress, so great in fact that they resorted to prayers. The deceitful ones were also punished, first of all by being almost choked by these who had been allowed out, and 
after that by being bound up tightly together to make them desist from such practices. But after a while they were set free. </p>

</p><b>1271.</b>
Erant postea spiritus quidam dolosi qui volebant ut emergerent, eisque infundebant ut dicerent se nihil esse, ut sic possent subire; auditum tunc tumultuosum in inferno isto, sicut turbulentum magnum 
volumen, quod erat emotio eorum quod cuperent eniti, quare etiam permissum erat iterum ut aliqui exsurgerent, et visi in loco eodem ubi priores; tentabant inde infundere mihi persuasivum lethale, adjuti 
a geniis dolosis, sed incassum quia tutatus a Domino; percepi usque manifeste, quod persuasivum eorum esset suffocativum: putabant se omnia posse, et unicuique vitam posse adimere; sed quia putabant 
se omnia posse, erat modo infans qui eos detrudebat, ex cujus praesentia ita titubabant ut clamarent quod angerentur, et quidem ita valde ut ad supplicationes confugerent: dolosi quoque puniti sunt, 
primum ab iis fere suffocati ei postea conglutinati ut desisterent a talibus, sed dein liberati. </p>
