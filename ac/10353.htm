<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10353节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10353</strong>.出埃及记31:12-18.耶和华晓谕摩西说：你要和以色列人讲话，说，你们务要守我的安息日，因为这是你我之间世世代代的证据，使你们知道我耶和华是叫你们成为圣的。所以你们要守安息日，以它为圣。凡干犯这日的，必死；凡在这日作工的，那灵魂必从他民中剪除。六日要作工，但第七日是完全安息的安息日，是向耶和华守为圣的；凡在安息日作工的，必死。故此以色列人要守安息日，他们世世代代要遵行安息日为一个时代的约。这是我和以色列人之间的一个证据，直到一个时代；因为六日之内耶和华造天地，第七日便安息，恢复呼吸。祂在西乃山和摩西说完了话，就把两块法版交给他，是用神的指头写的石版。<br />“耶和华晓谕摩西说”表从主经由圣言而来的光照和觉察。“你要和以色列人讲话，说”表通过圣言向那些属教会的人提供的信息。“你们务要守我的安息日”表关于神性本身与主之人身的合一的神圣、不断的思维。“因为这是你我之间的证据”表这是那些属教会的人在天堂被认识所用的主要方法。“世世代代”表在教会的每一个事物里面。“使你们知道我耶和华是叫你们成为圣的”表主的神性人身，天堂和教会的一切皆视这神性人身为它们独一的源头。“所以你们要守安息日”表主的神性人身要受到敬拜。“以它为圣”表构成教会的一切良善和真理的源头。“凡干犯这日的”表被自我和人自己的爱引导，而不是被主引导。“必死”表与天堂分离，以及属灵的死亡。“凡在这日作工的”表那些从天堂之爱转向肉体和世俗之爱的人。“那灵魂必从他民中剪除”表与那人同住的，不是天堂和教会，而是地狱。“六日要作工”表在天堂婚姻之前到来并为该婚姻所预备的状态。“但第七日是完全安息的安息日”表被视为目的的良善的状态，因而当一个人成为教会或教会的一个化身并进入天堂时的状态。“是向耶和华守为圣的”表神性。“凡在安息日作工的，必死”表被自我和人自己的爱引导，而不是被主引导，结果就是属灵的死亡。“故此以色列人要守安息日，他们世世代代要遵行安息日”表教会真正重要的事就是承认神性本身在主的人身里面的合一，这种承认必须存在于敬拜的每一个部分中。“为一个时代的约”表与主的结合，直到永远。“这是我和以色列人之间的一个证据，直到一个时代”表这是区分那些属教会的人和那些不属教会的人的方法。“因为六日之内耶和华造天地”表当教会正在建立时，一种争战和劳碌的状态。“第七日便安息，恢复呼吸”表当教会已经建立时，或当一个人已经重生时，一种良善的状态。“祂在西乃山和摩西说完了话，就把两块法版交给他”表主通过圣言与一个人的结合。“是用神的指头写的石版”表来自主自己的那里的神性真理。</p>

Verses 12-18. And Jehovah said unto Moses, saying, And speak thou unto the sons of Israel, saying, But yet ye shall keep My Sabbaths; for it is a sign between Me and you to your generations, to know 
that I am Jehovah who maketh you holy. And ye shall keep the Sabbath, for this is holy to you; he that profaneth it, dying he shall die; for everyone that doeth work on that day, that soul shall be cut 
off from the midst of his peoples. Six days shall work be done; and on the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Sabbath, holy to Jehovah; everyone that doeth work on the Sabbath day, dying he shall die. 
And the sons of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to perform the Sabbath to their generations, a covenant of an age. This is a sign between Me and the sons of Israel to an age; for in six days Jehovah 
made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day He rested, and took breath. And He gave unto Moses, in His completing to speak with Him on Mount Sinai, the two tables of the Testimony, tables of stone, 
written with the finger of God. "And Jehovah said unto Moses, saying" signifies enlightenment and perception by the Lord through the Word; "And speak thou also unto the sons of Israel, saying" signifies 
the informing by means of the Word of those who are of the church; "But yet ye shall keep My Sabbaths" signifies holy thought continually concerning the union of the Divine with the Lord's Human; "for 
it is a sign between Me and you" signifies that this is the chief thing by which those who are of the church are known in heaven; "to your generations" signifies in each and all things of the church; 
"to know that I am Jehovah who maketh you holy" signifies the Lord as to the Divine Human, which all things of heaven and of the church look to as their one only source; "and ye shall keep the Sabbath" 
signifies that the Divine Human of the Lord is to be worshipped; "for this is holy to you" signifies that from this is all the good and truth which make the church; "he that profaneth it" signifies 
to be led by one's self and one's own loves, and not by the Lord; "dying he shall die" signifies separation from heaven, and spiritual death; "for everyone that doeth work on that day" signifies who 
turns himself from heavenly loves to bodily and worldly loves; "that soul shall be cut off from the midst of his peoples" signifies that heaven and the church are not with him, but hell; "six days 
shall work be done" signifies the state which precedes and prepares for the heavenly marriage; "and on the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Sabbath" signifies the state of good which is the end regarded, 
thus when man becomes the church and enters heaven; "holy to Jehovah" signifies what is Divine; "everyone that doeth work on the Sabbath day, dying he shall die" signifies to be led by one's self 
and one's own loves, and not by the Lord; "and the sons of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to perform the Sabbath to their generations" signifies that the very essential of the church is the acknowledgment 
of the union of the Divine Itself in the Lord's Human, and that this must be in each and all things of worship; "a covenant of an age" signifies conjunction with the Lord to eternity; "it is a sign 
between Me and the sons of Israel to an age" signifies that by this those who are of the church are distinguished from those who are not of the church; "for in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth" 
signifies a state of combat and of labor while the church is being set up; "and on the seventh day He rested, and took breath" signifies a state of good when the church is being set up, or when man 
is being regenerated; "and He gave unto Moses, in His completing to speak with Him on Mount Sinai, the two tables of the Testimony" signifies the conjunction of the Lord with man through the Word; "tables 
of stone, written with the finger of God" signifies Divine truth therein from the Lord Himself. </p>

Verses 12-18  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, And you, speak to the children of Israel, saying, Surely you shall keep My sabbaths; for it is a sign between Me and you [throughout] your generations, 
that you may know that I Jehovah am sanctifying you. And you shall keep the sabbath, for it is holy to you. He who profanes it must certainly die; for everyone who does work on that [day], that soul 
will be cut off from the midst of his people. Work shall be done for six days, and on the seventh day there is the sabbath of rest<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>, holy to Jehovah; whoever does any work on the sabbath day must certainly 
die. And the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, observing the sabbath [throughout] their generations, the covenant of an age<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a>. This is a sign between Me and the children of Israel into 
an age<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a>; for in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day He rested and recovered His breath. And He gave to Moses, when He had finished talking to him on Mount Sinai, the two 
tablets of the Testimony, the tablets of stone, written with the finger of God. </p>
<p>'And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying' means enlightenment and perception from the Lord through the Word. 'And you, speak 
to the children of Israel, saying' means information provided by means of the Word to those who belong to the Church. 'Surely you shall keep My sabbaths' means thought which is holy and goes on unceasingly 
regarding the union of Divinity itself to the Lord's Human. 'For it is a sign between Me and you' means that it is the chief means by which those who belong to the Church are recognized in heaven. 
'[Throughout your generations' means within every single thing of the Church. 'That you may know that I Jehovah am sanctifying you' means the Lord's Divine Human, which all things of heaven and 
the Church look to as their one and only Source.] 'And you shall keep the sabbath' means that the Lord's Divine Human is to be worshipped. 'For it is holy to you' means the Source of all the goodness 
and truth which compose the Church. 'He who profanes it' means being led by self and one's own loves, and not by the Lord. 'Must certainly die' means being separated from heaven, and spiritual death. 
'Everyone who does work on that day' means those who turn away from heavenly loves to bodily and worldly loves. 'That soul will be cut off from the midst of his people' means that not heaven and the 
Church but hell resides with that person. 'Work shall be done for six days' means the state which comes before and is preparatory to the heavenly marriage. 'And on the seventh day there is the sabbath 
of rest' means the state of good that has been the end in view, thus the state when a person becomes an embodiment of the Church and enters heaven. 'Holy to Jehovah' means the Divine. 'Whoever does any 
work on the sabbath day must certainly die' means being led by self and by one's own loves, and not by the Lord, [and spiritual death is the result.] 'And the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, 
observing the sabbath [throughout] their generations' means that the truly essential thing of the Church is the acknowledgement of the union of the Divine itself within the Lord's Human, and that 
this acknowledgement must be present in every single part of worship. 'The covenant of an age' means being joined to the Lord to eternity. 'This is a sign between Me and the children of Israel into an 
age' means that this is the means by which those who belong to the Church are distinguished from those who do not belong to the Church. 'For in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth' means the state 
of conflict and labour while the Church is being established. 'And on the seventh day He rested and recovered His breath' means the state of good when the Church has been established, or when a person 
has been regenerated. 'And He gave to Moses, when He had finished talking to him from Mount Sinai, the two tablets of the Testimony' means a joining of the Lord to a person by means of the Word. 'The 
tablets of stone, written with the finger of God' means the Divine Truth there, coming from the Lord Himself.

Vers. 12-18. Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, dicendo, Et tu loquere ad filios Israelis, dicendo, Verumtamen sabbata Mea custodietis, quia signum id inter Me et inter vos generationibus vestris, ad sciendum 
quod Ego Jehovah sanctificans vos. Et custodietis sabbatum, quia sanctum hoc vobis; profanans illud moriendo morietur; quia omnis faciens in illo opus, et exscindetur anima illa e medio populorum 
suorum. Sex diebus fiet opus, et in die septimo sabbatum sabbati, sanctum Jehovae; omnis faciens opus in die sabbati moriendo morietur. Et custodient filii Israelis sabbatum ad faciendum sabbatum generationibus 
illorum, foedus saeculi. Inter Me et inter filios Israelis signum hoc in saeculum; quia sex diebus fecit Jehovah caelum et terram, et in die septimo quievit et respiravit. Et dedit ad Moschen 
in absolvendo Ipso ad loquendum cum illo in monte Sinai, duas tabulas testimonii, tabulas lapidis, scriptas digito Dei. {1}Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, dicendo' significat illustrationem et perceptionem 
per Verbum a Domino: `et tu loquere ad filios Israelis, dicendo' significat informationem eorum qui ab Ecclesia per Verbum: `verumtamen sabbata Mea custodietis' significat sanctam cogitationem 
jugiter de unione Divini cum Humano Domini: `quia signum id inter Me et inter vos' significat quod id principale per quod noscantur in caelo illi qui ab Ecclesia: (`generationibus vestris' significat

significat quod Divinum Humanum Domini colendum: `quia sanctum hoc vobis' significat inde omne bonum et verum quae faciunt Ecclesiam: `profanans illud' significat duci a semet et suis amoribus, 
et non a Domino: `moriendo morietur' significat separationem a caelo et mortem spiritualem: `omnis faciens in illo die opus' significat qui ad amores corporeos et mundanos ab amoribus caelestibus se 
convertit: `et exscindetur anima illa e medio populorum suorum' significat quod caelum et Ecclesia non sit apud illum, sed infernum: `sex diebus fiet opus' significat statum qui praecedit e praeparat 
ad conjugium caeleste: `et in die septimo sabbatum sabbati' significat statum boni qui finis propter quem, ita cum homo fit Ecclesia ac intrat caelum: `sanctum Jehovae' significat Divinum: `omnis faciens 
opus in die sabbati moriendo morietur' significat duci a semet et a suis amoribus, et non a Domino: `et custodient filii Israelis sabbatum ad faciendum sabbatum generationibus illorum' significat 
quod ipsum essentiale Ecclesiae sit agnitio unionis ipsius Divini in Humano Domini, et quod haec erit in omnibus et singulis cultus: `foedus saeculi' significat conjunctionem cum Domino in aeternum: `inter 
Me et inter filios Israelis signum hoc in saeculum' significat quod per id distinguantur illi qui ex Ecclesia ab illis qui non ex Ecclesia sunt: `quia sex diebus fecit Jehovah caelum et terram' 
significat statum pugnae et laboris cum instauratur Ecclesia: `et in die septimo quievit et respiravit' significat statum boni cum Ecclesia instaurata est, aut cum homo regeneratus: `et dedit ad Moschen

quae faciunt Ecclesiam: prophanans illud, significat qui negat et vituperat, qui ab Ecclesia: moriendo morietur, significat separationem prorsus et mortem spiritualem: quia omnis faciens in illo die opus, 
significat qui ad amores corporeos et mundanos ab illis se convertit: et exscindetur anima illa e medio populorum suorum, significat quod ad infernum. 15.  Sex diebus fiet opus, significat statum 
qui praecedit antequam homo in agnitionem internam ac fidem venit, ita antequam fit Ecclesia, ac intrat coelum: et in die septimo sabbathum sabbathi, significat statum qui finis propter quem, cum homo 
in agnitione interna ac fide est, et fit Ecclesia, ac intrat in coelum: sanctum Jehovae, quod significet quum ducitur a Domino: omnis faciens opus in die sabbathi, moriendo morietur, significat quod 
qui ex illo statu se convertit ad priorem, pereat. 16.  Et custodient filii Israelis sabbathum ad faciendum sabbathum generationibus illorum, significat quod tunc Ecclesia in omnibus et singulis cultus: 
foedus saeculi, significat quia tunc conjunctio cum coelo et Domino. 17.  Inter Me et inter filios Israelis signum hoc in saeculum, significat quod per id distinguantur et ab illis qui non ab Ecclesia
