<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7041节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7041.</strong>“在路上，在客栈的时候”表雅各的后代处于没有一个内在的外在。这从此处“摩西”的代表清楚可知。前后文在内义上所论述的主题是“以色列人”所表示的属灵教会；但这三节经文论述的是教会将要如何在雅各的后代中间得以建立，而事实上，它无法在他们中间建立，因为他们处于没有一个内在的外在。因此，摩西在此不是代表律法或圣言，而是代表这个民族，或雅各的后代，他要成为他们的领袖，因此也代表这个民族的敬拜。因为在圣言中，无论在何处，领袖或审判官，以及王都代表这个民族或百姓，他是他们的领袖，审判官或王，因为他是它的头（参看<a href="4789.htm">4789</a>节）。这解释了为何此处没有提及摩西的名，而是以“在路上，在客栈的时候”来指他，也解释了为何这时“耶和华遇见他，想要杀他”，然而此前是祂明确吩咐回埃及去。“在路上”表示被建立的东西，而“客栈”表示外在属世层或感官层（<a href="5495.htm">5495</a>节）。由于如前所述，所论述的主题是将要在雅各的后代中间建立的教会，故所表示的是属于这个民族的东西，即一个没有一个内在的外在，因而也表示一个脱离内层的外在属世层或感官层。脱离内层的感官层充满幻觉，因而充满虚假，它反对信之真理和良善（参看<a href="6948.htm">6948</a>，<a href="6949.htm">6949</a>节）。<br />在解释接下来的事之前，可先参看关于雅各代表的说明，即：他们中间有一个教会的代表，却没有一个真实的教会（参看<a href="4281.htm">4281</a>，<a href="4288.htm">4288</a>，<a href="6304.htm">6304</a>节）；他们中间的神性敬拜纯粹是脱离内在的外在，他们被外在手段驱使去敬拜（<a href="4281.htm">4281</a>，<a href="4433.htm">4433</a>，<a href="4844.htm">4844</a>，<a href="4847.htm">4847</a>，<a href="4865.htm">4865</a>，<a href="4899.htm">4899</a>，<a href="4903.htm">4903</a>节）；他们并没有被选中，相反是他们固执地坚持他们要成为一个教会（<a href="4290.htm">4290</a>，<a href="4293.htm">4293</a>节）；他们具有这样的性质，他们能代表神圣事物，尽管他们陷入各种肉体和世俗的爱中（<a href="4293.htm">4293</a>，<a href="4307.htm">4307</a>节）；这个民族从一开始就具有这种性质（<a href="4314.htm">4314</a>，<a href="4316.htm">4316</a>，<a href="4317.htm">4317</a>节）；还有关于该民族的其它许多事也已经说明（参看<a href="4444.htm">4444</a>，<a href="4459.htm">4459</a>e，<a href="4503.htm">4503</a>，<a href="4750.htm">4750</a>，<a href="4815.htm">4815</a>，<a href="4818.htm">4818</a>，<a href="4820.htm">4820</a>，<a href="4825.htm">4825</a>，<a href="4832.htm">4832</a>，<a href="4837.htm">4837</a>，<a href="4868.htm">4868</a>，<a href="4874.htm">4874</a>，<a href="4911.htm">4911</a>，<a href="4913.htm">4913</a>，<a href="5057.htm">5057</a>，<a href="6877.htm">6877</a>节）。</p>

And it came to pass in the way, in the inn. That this signifies that the posterity of Jacob were in externals without an internal, is evident from the representation of Moses here. In what precedes, 
and in what follows, the subject treated of in the internal sense is the spiritual church, which is meant by the "sons of Israel;" but in these three verses it is that this church was to have been instituted 
among the posterity of Jacob, but that it could not be instituted among them because they were in externals without an internal. For this reason Moses here does not represent the law or the Word, 
but that nation or posterity from Jacob of which he was to be the leader; thus he also represents the worship of that nation, for everywhere in the Word a leader or judge, and also a king, represents 
the nation and people of which he is the leader, judge, or king, because he is its head (see n. 4789). This is the reason why Moses is not here named, and yet by its coming to pass in the way, in 
the inn, he is meant, and that Jehovah then met him, and sought to kill him, when yet He had before so expressly commanded that he should go and return to Egypt. By "being in the way" is signified what 
is instituted; and by the "inn" is signified the external natural or sensuous (n. 5495). And because as before said the subject treated of is the church to be instituted among that posterity, therefore 
that is signified which belonged to that nation, namely, an external without an internal, thus also an external natural or sensuous, but separated. (That the sensuous separated from the internal is 
full of fallacies and the consequent falsities, and that it is against the truths and goods of faith, see n. 6948, 6949.) [2] Before the things which follow are unfolded, see what has been already 
shown concerning that posterity, namely, that with them there was the representative of a church, but not a church (see n. 4281, 4288, 6304); that Divine worship among them was merely external separate 
from internal, and that to this worship they were driven by external means (n. 4281, 4433, 4844, 4847, 4865, 4899, 4903); that they were not chosen, but that they obstinately insisted upon being a church 
(n. 4290, 4293); that they were of such a nature that they could represent holy things, although they were in bodily and worldly loves (n. 4293, 4307); that that nation was such from its first origins 
(n. 4314, 4316, 4317); and many other things which have been shown concerning that nation (see n. 4444, 4459, 4503, 4750, 4815, 4818, 4820, 4825, 4832, 4837, 4868, 4874, 4911, 4913, 5057, 6877). </p>

'And he was on the way in the lodging-place' means that the attention of the descendants of Jacob was focused on outward forms without their inner meaning. This becomes clear from the representation 
of 'Moses' here. In what has gone before and in what will follow the subject in the internal sense is the spiritual Church, meant by 'the children of Israel'; but the three verses here deal with how the 
Church was to have been established among Jacob's descendants but could not in fact be established among them because their attention was focused on outward forms without their inner meaning. Here 
therefore Moses does not represent the Law or the Word; instead he represents that nation, descendants of Jacob, whose leader he was to become, and so represents that nation's worship as well. For everywhere 
in the Word a leader, judge, or else king represents the nation or people whose leader, judge, or king he is since he is its head, see <a href="4789.htm">4789</a>. This explains why Moses is not referred to here by 
name, though he is meant by the one who 'was on the way in the lodging-place', and why Jehovah at this point 'came to meet him and sought to kill him', when yet previously He had commanded him so clearly 
to go and return to Egypt. His being 'on the way means what is established, while 'the lodging-place' means the external natural or that which exists on the level of the senses, <a href="5495.htm">5495</a>. And since, as 
has been stated, the subject is the Church that was to have been established among Jacob's descendants, the level on which that nation focused is meant, namely an external level without any internal 
level, and so an external natural level or that of the senses, separated from any inner level. When separated from any inner level the sensory level is full of illusions and consequently falsities, and 
it stands in opposition to forms of the truth and good of faith, see <a href="6948.htm">6948</a>, <a href="6949.htm">6949</a>. </p>

 Before the things that come next are explained, see what has been shown already regarding the descendants of 
Jacob:  </p>
<p>Among them there was a representative of the Church, but no real Church, <a href="4281.htm">4281</a>, <a href="4288.htm">4288</a>, <a href="6304.htm">6304</a>. </p>
<p>Divine worship among them was wholly external without anything internal, and they were driven to 
that worship by external means, <a href="4281.htm">4281</a>, <a href="4433.htm">4433</a>, <a href="4844.htm">4844</a>, <a href="4847.htm">4847</a>, <a href="4865.htm">4865</a>, <a href="4899.htm">4899</a>, <a href="4903.htm">4903</a>. </p>
<p>They were not chosen, yet they stubbornly insisted that they should be the Church, <a href="4290.htm">4290</a>, <a href="4293.htm">4293</a>. </p>
<p>They were such that they 
could represent holy things even though they were governed by bodily and worldly kinds of love, <a href="4293.htm">4293</a>, <a href="4307.htm">4307</a>. </p>
<p>That nation was like this right from the start, <a href="4314.htm">4314</a>, <a href="4316.htm">4316</a>, <a href="4317.htm">4317</a>. </p>

`Et fuit in via in diversorio': quod significet posteritatem ex Jacobo quod in externis absque interno, constare potest (c)a repraesentatione `Moschis' hic; in illis quae praecedunt et quae sequuntur 
agitur in sensu interno de Ecclesia spirituali, et intelligitur illa per `filios Israelis'; in his autem tribus versibus agitur de illa Ecclesia quod instituenda esset apud posteros Jacobi, sed quod 
apud illos institui non posset quia in externis erant absque interno; idcirco `Moscheh' hic non repraesentat Legem seu Verbum, sed repraesentat gentem illam seu posteritatem (c)ex Jacobo, cujus dux futurus 
{1}esset, ita quoque cultum illius gentis, nam in Verbo ubivis dux aut judex, et quoque rex repraesentat gentem et populum {2} cujus dux, judex, aut rex est ex causa quia caput ejus est, videatur 
n. 4789; inde est quod hic non Moscheh nominetur, sed usque per `fuit in via in diversorio' intelligatur, et quod Jehovah tunc occurrerit illi, et quaesiverit occidere illum, cum tamen {3}prius tam 
expresse mandaverit ut iret et reverteretur Aegyptum; per quod esset `in via,' significatur institutum; et per `diversorium' significatur externum naturale seu sensuale, n. 5495; et quia agitur, ut dictum 
est, de Ecclesia instituenda apud posteritatem illam, significatur tale quod fuit {4}`illi genti, nempe externum absque interno; ita quoque externum naturale seu sensuale, at separatum; (m)quod
