<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1718节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1718.</strong>“连他兄弟罗得和他的财物也都夺回来”表外在人及其所属一切。这从“罗得”的含义清楚可知，前面多次说过，“罗得”是指外在人。如今，几乎没人知道何为外在人。人们以为唯独属肉体之物构成外在人，如感觉官能，即触觉、味觉、嗅觉、听觉和视觉，以及欲望和乐趣。但这些构成最外在的人，也就是纯粹的肉体。实际上，构成外在人的，是属于记忆的知识、这人所充满的爱之情感，以及准确来说属于灵的感觉官能，连同灵所享受的乐趣。其实是这些东西构成外在人，或外层人，这从来世之人，或灵人明显可知。这些灵人同样拥有外在人，也同样拥有内层人，因而拥有内在人。肉体可以说纯粹是包裹物或外壳，它会消散，以便这人可以真正地活着，并且属于他的一切事物可以变得更优良。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1718.</strong> And Lot his brother and his property he also brought back means the outer self and everything in it. This is established by the symbolism of Lot as the outer self, as mentioned several times [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1718/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1428" target=_top>1428</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1718/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1547" target=_top>1547</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1718/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1563" target=_top>1563</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1718/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1698" target=_top>1698</a>].<br />Hardly anyone today knows what the outer self is, because people think that everything making up the outer self is connected with the body, such as its senses (touch, taste, smell, hearing, and sight), appetites, and pleasures. These constitute the most external self, however, which is purely physical.<br />The outer self proper is made up of facts in the memory, emotions belonging to the love that permeates us, the aspects of sensation that belong to our spirit, and the lower pleasures that are also the province of spirits. These compose what is strictly speaking our outer self. The evidence for this is that people in the other life (spirits, in other words) also have an outer self, an intermediate self, and consequently an inner self. The body is merely a kind of covering or shell that dissolves, allowing us truly to live and to improve in every way. </p>

And also brought back his brother Lot and his substance. That this signifies the external man and all that belongs to it, is evident from the signification of "Lot," which is the external man, as has 
been stated several times before. What the external man is, is scarcely known at this day; for it is thought that only that which belongs to the body constitutes the external man; as the faculties of 
sense, namely, the touch, taste, smell, hearing, and sight; and also the appetites and pleasures. But these constitute the outermost man, which is merely corporeal. The knowledges that belong to the 
memory, and the affections that are of the love, with which the man has been imbued, properly constitute the external man; also those faculties of sense which properly belong to the spirit, together with 
the pleasures that the spirit enjoys. That these properly constitute the external or exterior man, is evident from men in the other life, that is, spirits. These in like manner possess an external 
man, and in like manner an interior man, and consequently an internal man. The body is only as it were a covering, a crust, which is dissolved in order that the man may truly live, and that all things 
belonging to him may become more excellent. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1718</b></p><p><b>1718.</b>
'And also Lot his brother and his acquisitions he brought back' means the External Man and all that belonged to it. This is clear from the meaning of 'Lot' as the external man, dealt with frequently. 
What the external man is, scarcely anyone knows at the present day, for people imagine that solely the things belonging to the body constitute the external man, such as its sensory powers of touch, taste, 
smell, hearing, and sight, and also its appetites and pleasures. But these constitute the outermost man, which is merely bodily. The external man proper consists of the factual knowledge belonging 
to the memory and of the affections belonging to the love with which the person has been imbued, as well as consisting of the sensory powers which belong properly to the spirit, together with the pleasures 
which also reside with the spirit. The fact that these things properly constitute the external or exterior man becomes clear from human beings in the next life, that is, from spirits. These likewise 
have an external man, an interior man, and consequently an internal man. The body is merely a perishable covering or shell so to speak, which exists so that the person may truly live and so that 
all that constitutes his being may become more excellent. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1718</b>
</p><b>1718.</b>
'Et etiam Lotum fratrem suum et acquisitionem ejus reduxit': quod significet externum hominem et omnia quae illius, constat a significatione 'Loti' quod sit externus homo, de qua aliquoties: quid externus 
homo, vix hodie noscitur, putatur enim quod illa qua corporis sunt, solum constituant externum hominem, sicut ejus sensualia, nempe tactus, gustus, olfactus, auditus et visus, tum appetitus et 
voluptates, sed haec constituunt extimum qui mere corporeus est: externum hominem proprie constituunt scientifica quae sunt memoriae et affectiones quae sunt amoris, quo imbutus est homo, tum sensualia 
quae sunt propria spiritus, cum voluptatibus quae etiam apud spiritus sunt; quod haec proprie constituant externum vel exteriorem hominem, constare potest ab hominibus in altera vita seu a spiritibus; 
hi similiter illum habent, et similiter interiorem, et consequenter internum; corpus est modo quasi tegumentum seu quasi crusta quae dissolvitur, ut vere homo vivat, utque omnia ejus excellentiora fiant. </p>
