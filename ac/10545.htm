<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10545节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10545</strong>.“摩西拿一个帐棚”表敬拜、教会和圣言的神圣之物。这从“帐棚”的含义清楚可知，“帐棚”在至高意义上是指主，以及天堂和教会，在相对意义上是指属于天堂和教会的一切神圣之物，因而也指敬拜的神圣和圣言的神圣，因为敬拜和圣言属于教会，它们源于主，故是祂的。“帐棚”之所以表示这些事物，是因为上古时代的人住在帐棚里，还在里面举行他们的神圣敬拜。属天教会存在于这些人当中，该教会比后来的所有教会都要神圣。因为他们所敬拜的那一位是主；对他们来说，耶和华不是别人，正是主。由于正是祂引领他们，所以他们直接与天堂天使交往，从而拥有来自主的属天智慧。创世记第一章天地的创造就描述了这个教会的建立，伊甸园则描述了他们的智慧；因为在圣言中，“天 和地”表示教会，“伊甸园”表示聪明和智慧，“人”表示教会本身，和“地”一样，亚当因地而得名。在圣言中，“天和地”表示教会，“天”表示内在教会，“地”表示外在教会（参看<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>，<a href="3355.htm">3355</a>e，<a href="4535.htm">4535</a>，<a href="10373.htm">10373</a>节）；伊甸园和其它园子描述了聪明和智慧（<a href="100.htm">100</a>，<a href="108.htm">108</a>，<a href="2702.htm">2702</a>，<a href="3220.htm">3220</a>节）；“人”表示教会（ <a href="478.htm">478</a>，<a href="768.htm">768</a>，<a href="4287.htm">4287</a>，<a href="9276.htm">9276</a>节），“地”也表示教会（<a href="566.htm">566</a>，<a href="1068.htm">1068</a>节）；“创造人”表示建立教会（<a href="16.htm">16</a>，<a href="88.htm">88</a>，<a href="10373.htm">10373</a>；也可参看<a href="8891.htm">8891</a>，<a href="9942.htm">9942</a>节）。<br />由于主钟爱这个教会胜过其它一切教会，并且主与他们同住在帐棚里（因为约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.23.htm">14:23</a>说，主与爱祂的人同住），所以为了纪念这些事，便在以色列民族当中设立了帐幕或会幕，为他们的神圣敬拜提供场所。住棚节或帐棚节也是因为这个原因而设立的。<br />“帐棚”表示那些神圣之物，尤表敬拜的神圣，这一点从以下经文明显看出来，以赛亚书：<br />你这不怀孕、不生育的啊，要歌唱！要扩张你帐棚之地，伸展你居所的帷幔。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛54.1.htm">54:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛54.2.htm">2</a>）<br />“扩张你帐棚之地”表示向属于教会，因而向属于敬拜的事物如此行；“伸展你居所的帷幔”表示使真理增多，“帷幔”表示教会的真理（参看<a href="9595.htm">9595</a>，<a href="9596.htm">9596</a>，<a href="9606.htm">9606</a>，<a href="9756.htm">9756</a>节）；“不生育的”表示之前从未处于教会的真理和良善的人（<a href="3908.htm">3908</a>，<a href="9325.htm">9325</a>节）。<br />耶利米书：<br />全地荒废。我的帐棚忽然荒废；我的帷幔顷刻荒废。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.20.htm">4:20</a>）<br />“地”表示教会（参看<a href="9325.htm">9325</a>节提到的地方）；由于教会凭爱之良善和信之真理而为教会，所以经上说“帐棚和帷幔”都荒废；“帐棚”表示教会的良善，“帷幔”表示教会的真理。<br />同一先知书：<br />我的帐棚荒废，我的绳索都折断。我的儿子离我出去，没有了；无人再支搭我的帐棚，挂起我的帷幔。因为牧人都变得愚蠢。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶10.20.htm">10:20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶10.21.htm">21</a>）<br />“帐棚”和“帷幔”在此表示类似事物；“绳索折断”表示良善和真理不再结合在一起；因此，经上说“我的儿子离我出去”，因为“儿子”表示真理。“绳索”表示一种结合（参看 <a href="9777.htm">9777</a>，<a href="9854.htm">9854</a>，<a href="9880.htm">9880</a>节）；“儿子”表示真理（<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="2623.htm">2623</a>，<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>，<a href="2813.htm">2813</a>，<a href="3373.htm">3373</a>，<a href="3704.htm">3704</a>，<a href="4257.htm">4257</a>，<a href="9807.htm">9807</a>节）。<br />诗篇：<br />耶和华啊，谁能寄居你的帐棚？谁能住在你的圣山？就是行为纯全、作事公义、心里说真实话的人。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗15.1.htm">15:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗15.2.htm">2</a>）<br />“寄居耶和华的帐棚”表示住在天堂和那里的爱之良善中。<br />我要永远住在你的帐棚里。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗61.4.htm">61:4</a>）<br />此处意思是一样的。<br />阿摩司书：<br />到那日，我必树起大卫倒塌的帐棚，堵住其中的破口，恢复那破坏的地方。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩9.11.htm">9:11</a>）<br />“大卫的帐棚”表示主的教会和对祂的敬拜的神圣；“堵住破口，恢复破坏的地方”表示通过除去虚假而恢复这些事物。在圣言中，“大卫”表示主（参看<a href="1888.htm">1888</a>，<a href="9954.htm">9954</a>节）；因此，“大卫的帐棚”表示主的教会和敬拜的神圣。耶利米书：<br />看哪，我必使雅各被掳去的帐棚归回， 也必顾惜他的住处。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶30.18.htm">30:18</a>）<br />“雅各的帐棚”和“他的住处”表示教会的良善和真理。<br />“帐棚”因表示教会和敬拜的良善，故在反面意义上表示敬拜和教会的邪恶，这一点从下列经文可以看出来，耶利米书：<br />我要将锡安的女儿比作那秀美的女子；牧人和他们的羊群必到她那里，他们必在她周围支搭帐棚。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶6.2.htm">6:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶6.3.htm">3</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />起来攻击基达，使东方人荒废。他们要夺去帐棚和羊群，帷幔和一切器皿。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.28.htm">49:28</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.29.htm">29</a>）<br />何西阿书：<br />在庄严的日子，在耶和华节期的日子，你们怎样行呢？看哪！他们因荒废而逃离；蒺藜必占据他们用银子做的宝物；荆棘必生在他们的帐棚中。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何9.5.htm">9:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/何9.6.htm">6</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />祂击杀埃及的一切长子，在含的帐棚中，击杀他们强壮时头生的。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗78.51.htm">78:51</a>）</p>

And Moses took a tent. That this signifies what is holy of worship, of the church, and of the Word, is evident from the signification of "a tent," as being in the supreme sense the Lord, and also heaven 
and the church, and in the relative sense all that is holy of heaven and of the church, consequently also what is holy of worship and of the Word, for these are of the church and are of the Lord, 
because they are from Him. The reason why "a tent" signifies these things, is that the most ancient people dwelt in tents, and also had therein their holy worship. Among these people existed the celestial 
church, which was the most holy of all the succession of churches, for they adored the Lord, who with them was Jehovah; and as He was their Leader, they had interaction with the angels of heaven, 
and consequently were in celestial wisdom from the Lord. It is the setting up of this church which is described by the creation of heaven and earth in the first chapter of Genesis, and their wisdom by 
paradise. For by "heaven and earth" in the Word is signified the church, by "paradise" intelligence and wisdom, and by "man" the church itself; in like manner by the "ground" from which he was named 
"Adam." (That "heaven and earth" in the Word denote the church, "heaven" the internal church and "earth" the external church, see n. 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 3355, 4535, 10373; that intelligence and wisdom 
are described by paradises and gardens, n. 100, 108, 2702, 3220; that "man" denotes the church, n. 478, 768, 4287, 9276; in like manner "ground," n. 566, 1068; and that "creating man" denotes the 
setting up of the church, n. 16, 88, 10373; see also n. 8891, 9942.) [2] In consequence of that church being loved above all others, and from the Lord dwelling with them in tents (for the Lord is said 
"to dwell" with the man who is in love to Him, John 14:23), therefore in memory of these things the Tabernacle or Tent of meeting was constructed among the Israelitish nation, wherein was held what 
is holy of worship; and for the same reason the feast of tabernacles or of tents was instituted. [3] That by "tent" are signified these holy things, and specifically what is holy of worship, is evident 
from the following passages: </p>
<p>     Sing, O barren, that did not bear, enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations (Isa. 54:1, 2). "To enlarge the 
place of the tent" denotes to do so with the things which are of the church, and consequently which are of worship; "to stretch forth the curtains of the habitations" denotes to multiply truths (that 
"curtains" denote the truths of the church, see n. 9595, 9596, 9606, 9756); "the barren" denotes one who has not previously been in the truths and goods of the church (n. 3908, 9325). [4] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p> 
    The whole land has been laid waste, suddenly have My tents been laid waste, and My curtains in a moment (Jer. 4:20). That "land" denotes the church may be seen in the places cited in n. 9325; 
and as the church is the church from the goods of love and the truths of faith, therefore it is said that "the tents and the curtains are laid waste;" "tents" denoting the goods of the church, and "curtains" 
its truths. [5] Again: </p>
<p>     My tent hath been laid waste, and all My cords have been plucked out; My sons are gone forth from Me, and they are not; there is none to stretch forth My tent any 
more, or to raise up My curtains. For the shepherds are become fools (Jer. 10:20, 21). Like things are here signified by "tent" and by "curtains;" the "cords plucked out" denotes that there is no longer 
any conjunction of good and truth, and of truths one with another; and therefore it is said, "My sons are gone forth," because by "sons" are signified truths. (That "cords" denote conjunction may 
be seen in n. 9777, 9854, 9880; and that "sons" denote truths, in n. 489, 491, 533, 2623, 2803, 2813, 3373, 3704, 4257, 9807.) [6] In David: </p>
<p>     Jehovah, who shall abide in Thy tent, who shall dwell 
in the mountain of Thy holiness? He that walketh blameless, and who doeth righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart (Ps. 15:1, 2). "To abide in the tent of Jehovah" denotes to do so in heaven 
and in the good of love there. Again: </p>
<p>     I will abide in Thy tent to eternities (Ps. 61:4); </p>
<p>where the meaning is the same. [7] In Amos: </p>
<p>     In that day I will raise the tent of David that 
is fallen, and I will close up the breaches thereof, and I will restore its ruins (Amos 9:11). The "tent of David" denotes the church of the Lord and what is holy of the worship of Him; "to close up 
the breaches, and restore the ruins" denotes to restore these by removing falsities. That "David" in the Word denotes the Lord, see n. 1888, 9954; hence it is that "the tent of David" denotes the church 
of the Lord, and that which is holy of worship. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Behold I bring back the captivity of Jacob's tents, and I will have compassion on his dwelling places (Jer. 30:18); </p>
<p>where "the tents 
of Jacob," and "his dwelling places," denote the goods and truths of the church. [8] As by "tents" are signified the goods of the church and of worship, therefore by "tents" in the opposite sense 
are signified the evils of worship and of the church, as can be seen from the following passages: </p>
<p>     I will liken the daughter of Zion to a comely woman; shepherds and their flocks shall come unto 
her, and they shall fix their tents against her round about (Jer. 6:2, 3).      Go up against Arabia, and lay waste the sons of the east. Their tents and their flocks they shall take, their curtains, 
and all their vessels (Jer. 49:28, 29).      What will ye do in the day of the solemnity, and in the day of the feast of Jehovah? For lo they are gone away because of the laying waste; the desirable 
things of their silver, the nettle shall possess them; thorns shall be in their tents (Hos. 9:5, 6).      He smote all the firstborn of Egypt, the beginning of strengths in the tents of Ham (Ps. 78:51). </p>

'And Moses took a tent' means the holiness of worship, the Church, and the Word. This is clear from the meaning of 'a tent' in the highest sense as the Lord, also heaven and the Church, and in the relative 
sense as everything holy belonging to heaven and the Church, consequently also the holiness of worship and the holiness of the Word; for worship and the Word belong to the Church, and they are 
the Lord's since they are derived from Him. The reason why 'a tent' means these things is that the most ancient people used to live in tents and also to hold their holy worship in them. Among these people 
the celestial Church existed, and this was holier than all the Churches that came after it. For the one they worshipped was the Lord; for them Jehovah was none other than Him. And since it was He 
who led them, they were in direct contact with the angels of heaven, as a consequence of which they possessed heavenly wisdom that comes from the Lord. The establishment of that Church is what the creation 
of heaven and earth in the first chapter of Genesis describes, and their wisdom is what paradise describes; for 'heaven and earth' in the Word means the Church, 'paradise' means intelligence and 
wisdom, and 'man' (homo) means the Church itself, as does 'the ground', from which the name Adam derives.  </p>
<p>'Heaven and earth' in the Word means the Church, 'heaven' the internal Church and 'earth' 
the external Church, see <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="1850.htm">1850</a>, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>, <a href="2118.htm">2118</a>, <a href="3355.htm">3355</a>(end), <a href="4535.htm">4535</a>, <a href="10373.htm">10373</a>.  Intelligence and wisdom is described by paradise-like and other gardens, <a href="100.htm">100</a>, <a href="108.htm">108</a>, <a href="2702.htm">2702</a>, <a href="3220.htm">3220</a>.  'Man' means the Church, <a href="478.htm">478</a>, <a href="768.htm">768</a>, <a href="4287.htm">4287</a>, <a href="9276.htm">9276</a>, and so does 'the ground', <a href="566.htm">566</a>, <a href="1068.htm">1068</a>.  'Creating man' means establishing the Church, <a href="16.htm">16</a>, <a href="88.htm">88</a>, <a href="10373.htm">10373</a>.  See in addition <a href="8891.htm">8891</a>, <a href="9942.htm">9942</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Because this Church was the Lord's beloved 
more than all the rest and the Lord had His home with them in their tents (for the Lord is said to have His home with the person who loves Him, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:23)&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:23)</a>, therefore to commemorate these things the 
tabernacle or tent of meeting was erected among the Israelite nation, to house their holy worship. And this was why the feast of tabernacles or tents was instituted.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The fact that 'tent' means 
those holy things, and in particular the holiness of worship, is clear from the following places: In Isaiah,  </p>
<p>Sing, O barren one that did not bear. Enlarge the place of your tent, and let them stretch 
out the curtains of your dwelling-places. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2054:1,2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 54:1,2</a>.  </p>
<p>'Enlarging the place of the tent' means doing so to the things which belong to the Church and consequently to those which belong to worship. 
'Stretching out the curtains of the dwelling-places' means multiplying truths, 'curtains' meaning the Church's truths, see <a href="9595.htm">9595</a>, <a href="9596.htm">9596</a>, <a href="9606.htm">9606</a>, <a href="9756.htm">9756</a>. 'Barren one' means the person with whom the Church's 
truths and forms of good have not existed hitherto, <a href="3908.htm">3908</a>, <a href="9325.htm">9325</a>. </p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
The whole land has been laid waste. Suddenly My tents have been laid waste, My curtains in a moment. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%204:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 4:20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The land' means the Church, see in the places referred to in <a href="9325.htm">9325</a>; and since the Church is the Church by virtue of forms of the good of love and by virtue of the truths of faith it says that tents 
and curtains have been laid waste, 'tents' being the Church's forms of good and 'curtains' its truths.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
My tent has been laid waste, and all My ropes torn away. My 
sons have gone away from Me, and they are not. There is no one stretching out My tent any more, or setting up My curtains. For the shepherds have become stupid. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2010:20,21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 10:20,21</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Similar things are meant 
here by 'tent' and 'curtains'. 'Ropes torn away' means that goodness and truth are no longer joined together, nor truths to one another. Therefore also it says 'My sons have gone away', for truths 
are meant by 'sons'.  </p>
<p>'Ropes' means a joining together, see <a href="9777.htm">9777</a>, <a href="9854.htm">9854</a>, <a href="9880.htm">9880</a>.  'Sons' means truths, <a href="489.htm">489</a>, <a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="533.htm">533</a>, <a href="2623.htm">2623</a>, <a href="2803.htm">2803</a>, <a href="2813.htm">2813</a>, <a href="3373.htm">3373</a>, <a href="3704.htm">3704</a>, <a href="4257.htm">4257</a>, <a href="9807.htm">9807</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In David,  </p>
<blockquote>
O Jehovah, who 
will sojourn in Your tent? Who will dwell on Your holy mountain? He who walks blameless and who does righteousness, and speaks the truth in his heart. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2015:1,2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 15:1,2</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Sojourning in Jehovah's tent' means 
abiding in heaven, and in the good of love there. In the same author,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will remain in Your tent forever. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2061:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 61:4</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here the meaning is similar.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 In Amos,  </p>
<blockquote>
On that day I will raise 
up the tent of David that is fallen down, and I will close up its breaches and restore its destroyed places. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%209:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 9:11</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The tent of David' means the Lord's Church and the holiness that goes with 
worship of Him. 'Closing up breaches and restoring destroyed places' means renewing those things by moving falsities away from them. 'David' in the Word means the Lord, see <a href="1888.htm">1888</a>, <a href="9954.htm">9954</a>, so that 'the 
tent of David' means the Lord's Church and the holiness that goes with worship. In Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, I will bring back the captivity<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the tents of Jacob, and will have compassion on his dwellings. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2030:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 30:18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The tents of Jacob' and 'his dwellings' stand for the Church's forms of good and its truths.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 Since forms of good present in the Church and in worship are meant by 'tents', 
forms of evil present in worship and in the Church are meant in the contrary sense by 'tents', as may be recognized from the following places: In Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will liken the daughter of Zion to one 
who is comely. Shepherds and their flocks will come to her and pitch their tents against her round about. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%206:2,3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 6:2,3</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
Go up against Arabia, and lay waste the sons of the 
east. They will take their tents and their flocks, their curtains and all their vessels. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2049:28,29&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 49:28,29</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In Hosea,  </p>

`Et Moscheh accepit tentorium':  quod significet sanctum cultus, Ecclesiae, et Verbi, constat ex significatione `tentorii' quod in supremo sensu sit Dominus, et quoque caelum et Ecclesia, (c)et in sensu 
respectivo omne sanctum caeli et Ecclesiae, inde quoque sanctum cultus et sanctum Verbi, nam haec sunt Ecclesiae, et sunt Domini, quia ab Ipso.  Quod `tentorium' illa significet, est quia antiquissimi 
in tentoriis habitabant, et quoque in illis sanctum suum cultum habebant; apud antiquissimos fuit Ecclesia caelestis, quae sanctissima omnium Ecclesiarum sequentium fuit, Dominum enim adorabant, 
Ipse fuit illis Jehovah; et quia Ipse illos ducebat, commercium habebant cum angelis caeli; et inde a Domino in sapientia caelesti erant; instauratio illius Ecclesiae est quae describitur per creationem 
caeli et terrae in primo capite Geneseos, (c)et (c)eorum sapientia per paradisum, nam per caelum et terram in Verbo significatur Ecclesia, per `paradisum' intelligentia et sapientia, et per `hominem' 
ipsa Ecclesia, pariter per `humum,' ex qua nominatus est Adam; quod `caelum et terra' in Verbo sit Ecclesia, `caelum' Ecclesia interna, et `terra' Ecclesia externa, videatur n. 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 
3355 fin., 4535, 10373, quod intelligentia et sapientia describatur per `paradisos' et hortos, n. 100, 108, 2702, 3220, quod `homo' sit Ecclesia, n. 478, 768, 4287, (x)9276, et quoque `humus,' n. 
566, 1068, et quod `creare hominem' sit instaurare Ecclesiam, n. 16, 88, 10373; {1}videantur praeterea n. 8891 9942. 	[2] Ex eo quod Ecclesia illa prae ceteris amata fuerit {2}, et Dominus apud illos 
in tentoriis habitaverit, Dominus enim dicitur habitare apud hominem qui in amore in Ipsum est, Joh. xiv (x)23; ideo in memoriam illorum tabernaculum seu tentorium conventus exstructum fuit apud gentem 
Israeliticam, in quo sanctum cultus habebatur; ac ideo festum {3}tabernaculorum seu tentoriorum institutum est. 	[3] Quod per `tentorium' significentur sancta illa, ac in specie sanctum cultus, constat 
ex sequentibus his locis:  apud Esaiam, 	Canta, sterilis, non pepererat; amplifica locum tentorii tui, cortinas habitaculorum tuorum expandant, liv 1, 2; </p>
<p>`amplificare locum tentorii' est illa 
quae sunt Ecclesiae, et inde quae sunt cultus, `expandere cortinas habitaculorum' est multiplicare vera; quod `cortinae' sint vera Ecclesiae, videatur n. 9595, 9596, 9606, 9756, `sterilis' est qui non 
prius in {4}veris et bonis Ecclesiae fuit, n. 3908, 9325:  apud Jeremiam, 	Devastata est tota terra, subito devastata sunt tentoria mea, (x)momento cortinae meae, iv 20; </p>
<p>[4] quod `terra' sit Ecclesia, 
videatur in locis citatis n. 9325; et quia Ecclesia est Ecclesia ex bonis amoris et {5} veris fidei, ideo dicitur `devastata sunt tentoria, (c)et cortinae'; `tentoria' sunt bona Ecclesiae, ac `cortinae' 
sunt vera ejus:  apud eundem, 	Tentorium meum devastatum est, et omnes funes mei evulsi; filii mei exiverunt a me, et non illi, non tendens amplius tentorium meum, aut erigens cortinas meas, 
quia stulti facti sunt pastores, x 20, 21; </p>
<p>similia hic per `tentorium' et per `cortinas' significantur; `funes evulsi' sunt quod non amplius conjunctio boni et veri, ac verorum inter se; ideo quoque 
dicitur `filii mei exiverunt' quia per `filios' significantur vera; quod `funes' sint conjunctio, videatur n. 9777, (x)9854, 9880, et quod `filii' sint vera, n. 489, 491, 533, 2623, 2803, 2813, 3373, 
3704, 4257, 9807; [6] apud Davidem, 	Jehovah, quis commorabitur in tentorio Tuo? quis habitabit in monte sanctitatis Tuae? qui ambulat integer, et qui facit justitiam, et loquitur veritatem in corde 
suo, Ps. xv 1, 2; </p>
<p>`commorari in tentorio Jehovae' est in caelo, (c)et ibi in bono amoris:  apud eundem, 	Manebo in tentorio Tuo in aeternitates, Ps. lxi 5 [A.V. 4]; </p>
<p>[7] similiter:  apud Amos, 	In 
die illo erigam tentorium Davidis collapsum, et obsaepiam rupturas et destructa ejus restituam, ix 11; </p>
<p>tentorium Davidis' est Ecclesia Domini, et sanctum cultus Ipsius, `obsaepire rupturas et destructa 
restituere' est restaurare {6}illa amovendo falsa; quod `David' in Verbo sit Dominus, videatur n. 1888, 9954; inde est quod `tentorium Davidis' sit Ecclesia Domini et sanctum cultus {7}:  apud Jeremiam, 	Ecce 
Ego reducens captivitatem tentoriorum Jacobi, et habitaculorum ejus (x)miserebor, xxx 18; </p>
<p>`tentoria Jacobi et habitacula ejus' pro Ecclesiae bonis et veris. 	[8] Quoniam per `tentoria' 
significantur bona Ecclesiae et cultus, ideo per `tentoria' in opposito sensu significantur mala cultus et Ecclesiae, ut constare potest ex his locis:  apud Jeremiam, 	Formosae assimilabo filiam Zionis, 
ad eam venient pastores et greges eorum, et figent contra eam tentoria circumcirca, vi 2, 3: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Ascendite contra Arabiam, et devastate filios orientis, tentoria eorum, et greges eorum 
sument, cortinas eorum, et omnia vasa eorum, xlix 28, 29: </p>
<p>apud Hoscheam, 	Quid facietis die sollemnitatis, et die festi Jehovae? quia ecce abiverunt prae devastatione, desiderabilia argenti eorum, 
carduus possidebit ea, spina in tentoriis eorum, ix 5, 6: </p>
<p>apud Davidem, 	Percussit omnem primogenitum Aegypti, principium roborum in tentoriis Chami, Ps. lxxviii 51. @1 et$ @2 i a Domino$ @3 tentoriorum 
seu tabernaculorum$ @4 bonis et veris$ @5 i ex$ @6 illam$ @7 i Ipsius$ </p>
