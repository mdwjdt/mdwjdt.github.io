<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2716节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2716.</strong>关于第二个奥秘，即属灵之人所具有的模糊性被主的神圣人性照亮。这个奥秘难以解释得清楚，因为这不得不描述神性的流注。不过，仅从以下考虑或许能获得关于它的某种概念：即若至高无上的神性本身真地流入所描述的这种善，就是被许多恶与假所玷污的善中，那么它无法被接受；若拥有这种善的人有所接受，那他必受到地狱般的折磨，从而灭亡。但主的神圣人性能流入这些人里面，并照亮这善。如同早晨太阳照亮密云，并穿透它们，带来黎明破晓的壮观景象。然而，主无法在他们面前显为日光，只能显为月光。由此可见，主降世的动机是拯救属灵之人（参看<a href="2661.htm">2661</a>节）。</p>

As regards the second arcanum, namely, that the obscurity with the spiritual is illuminated by the Lord's Divine Human, it is one which cannot be explained to the comprehension, for it is the influx 
of the Divine that would have to be described. But some idea of it may be obtained by considering that if the Supreme Divine Itself were to flow into such a good as has been described, defiled by so many 
evils and falsities, it could not be received; and if anything were received by the man who had such good, he would feel infernal torture and would thus perish. But the Lord's Divine Human can flow 
in with such men and can illuminate such good, as the sun shines into the dense clouds and transforms them in the early morning into the glories of the dawn; and yet the Lord cannot appear before them 
as the light of the sun, but as the light of the moon. Hence it is evident that the cause of the Lord's coming into the world was that the spiritual might be saved (see n. 2661). </p>

As for the second arcanum - that the obscurity with those who are spiritual is brightened by light from the Lord's Divine Human - it is an arcanum that cannot be explained intelligibly, for it is the 
influx of the Divine that would have to be described. But one may gain some idea of it simply from the consideration that if the Supreme Divine Itself were to flow into the kind of good that has been 
described - good that has been defiled by so many evils and falsities - It could not be received; and if anything were received by someone possessing such good he would experience hellish torment and 
so perish. But the Lord's Divine Human is able to enter into those persons and to brighten such good, much as the sun shining into thick clouds produces in the early morning lovely signs of the dawn 
breaking. Yet the Lord is unable to present Himself before them as the light of the sun, only as the light of the moon. From this it may be seen that the reason the Lord came into the world was to save 
those who are spiritual, see <a href="2661.htm">2661</a>. </p>

Quod alteram attinet, nempe quod obscurum illud apud spirituales illuminetur a Divino Humano Domini, est arcanum quod non ad captum explicari potest, nam est influxus Divini qui describeretur; solum 
inde aliqua ejus idea haberi potest, si ipsum Supremum Divinum influeret in bonum tale sicut descriptum, ex tot malis et falsis conspurcatum {1}, quod non potuisset recipi, et si (o)quid reciperetur, 
sentiret cruciatum infernalem, hoc est, homo cui tale bonum, et sic periret; at Divinum Humanum Domini apud (c)eos influere potest, ac bonum tale illuminare, sicut solet sol in densas nubes quae variegantur 
matutino tempore {2} in facies aurorae {3}; sed usque non potest Dominus coram illis sicut lux solis, sed sicut lux lunae apparere: exinde constare potest quod causa Adventus Domini in mundum 
fuerit propter spirituales ut salvarentur, videatur n. 2661. 	@1 obscuratum.$ 	@2 i inde.$ 	@3 A d pulchros colores, i facies aurorae.$ </p>
