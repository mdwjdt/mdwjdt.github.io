<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1459节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1459.</strong>创世记12:10. 那地遭遇饥荒。因那地饥荒严重，亚伯兰就下埃及去，要寄居在那里。<br />“那地遭遇饥荒”表主在孩童时仍缺乏认知。“亚伯兰就下埃及去，要寄居在那里”表在认知方面来自圣言的教导，“埃及”表由认知构成的知识，“寄居”表接受教导。“因那地饥荒严重”表主外在人中的巨大匮乏。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1459.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1459/bible_king-james-version_genesis_12_10" target=_top>Genesis 12:10</a>. And there was famine in the land; and Abram went down into Egypt to reside as an immigrant there, because the famine was heavy in the land.<br />There was famine in the land symbolizes the scarcity of knowledge that still affected the Lord when he was young. And Abram went down into Egypt to reside as an immigrant means being taught concepts from the Word; Egypt is the knowledge of those concepts, while residing as an immigrant is being taught. Because the famine was heavy in the land symbolizes a severe shortage in his outer self. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1459</b></p><p><b>1459.</b>
Verse 10. And there was a famine in the land. And Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; because the famine was grievous in the land. "There was a famine in the land," signifies a scarcity of knowledges 
as yet with the Lord when a child; "and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn," signifies instruction in knowledges from the Word; "Egypt" is the memory-knowledge of knowledges [scientia cognitionum]; 
"to sojourn" is to be instructed; "because the famine was grievous in the land," signifies much scarcity in His external man. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1459</b></p><p><b>1459.</b>
Verse 10 And there was a famine in the land; and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine in the land was serious. </p>
<p>'There was a famine in the land' means a lack of cognitions which 
still existed with the Lord when He was a boy. 'And Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn' means instruction in cognitions from the Word, 'Egypt' meaning knowledge comprised of cognitions, 'sojourning' 
receiving instruction. 'For the famine in the land was serious' means a great lack in His External Man. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1459</b>
</p><b>1459.</b>
Vers. 10.  Et fuit fames in terra; et descendit Abram in Aegyptum ad peregrinandum ibi; quia gravis fames in terra. 'Fuit fames in terra' significat penuriam cognitionum quae adhuc apud Dominum cum 
puer:  'et descendit Abram in Aegyptum ad peregrinandum' significat instructionem in cognitionibus ex Verbo; 'Aegyptus' est scientia cognitionum; 'peregrinari' est instrui:  'quia gravis fames in terra' 
significat multam penuriam apud externum Ipsius hominem. </p>
