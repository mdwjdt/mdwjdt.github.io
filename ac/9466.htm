<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9466节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9466.</strong>“蓝色”表对真理的属天之爱。这从“蓝色”的含义清楚可知，“蓝色”是指对真理的属天之爱。“蓝色”之以具有这种含义，是因为它是一种天空的颜色，这种颜色表示来自一个属天源头的真理，也就是源于对主之爱的良善的真理。这种良善在至内层天堂占主导地位，在中间或第二层天堂显为紫色和蓝色。该良善本身显为紫色，源于它的真理显为蓝色。因为当颜色出现在来世和天堂本身时，它们是最美丽的颜色；都来源于良善和真理。事实上，对良善和真理的情感的气场也通过颜色呈现在天使和灵人眼前，具体事物通过各种颜色的物体而显现，也通过气味呈给鼻子。因为属于良善的一切属天事物和属于真理的一切属灵事物，在低层天堂通过诸如出现在自然界的那类事物来代表，并通过这种方式呈给那里的灵人和天使的实际外在感官。对良善和真理的情感的气场之所以通过颜色而显为可见，是因为颜色是天堂之光，因而聪明和智慧的修改（参看<a href="4530.htm">4530</a>，<a href="4677.htm">4677</a>，<a href="4742.htm">4742</a>，<a href="4922.htm">4922</a>节）。<br />这解释了为何在为帐幕和亚伦的衣服而收集的材料中有蓝色、紫色、染过两次的朱红色线，染红的公羊皮；因为帐幕代表主的天堂，用来建造和遮盖它的材料代表属于良善和真理的属天和属灵事物；亚伦的衣服具有类似的代表（<a href="9457.htm">9457</a>节）。这就解释了为何法柜里面的幔子用蓝色、紫色、染过两次的朱红色线和细麻织成（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.31.htm">26:31</a>）；帐幕的门帘也是如此（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.36.htm">26:36</a>）；院子的门帘同样如此（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出27.16.htm">27:16</a>）；以及为何幔子边上的钮扣做蓝色的（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.4.htm">26:4</a>）。这也解释了为何以弗得用金色、蓝色、紫色、染过两次的朱红色线，并细麻织成；决断的胸牌同样如此（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.6.htm">28:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.15.htm">15</a>）。<br />在以西结书，“蓝色”表示对真理的属天之爱，“蓝衣”表示出于这爱的关于真理的认知或知识：<br />你的篷帆是用埃及刺绣的细麻布做的，可以作你的大旗；你的篷是用以利沙岛的蓝色、紫色布做的。这些商人以美好的货物、成捆的蓝色绣工、成箱的华丽衣服与你交易。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.7.htm">27:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.24.htm">24</a>）<br />这论及推罗，推罗表示关于真理和良善的认知或知识（<a href="1201.htm">1201</a>节）。知识和从知识所获得的理解力被描述为“埃及刺绣”和“以利沙岛的蓝色、紫色布”；“埃及刺绣”是指真理的记忆知识；“以利沙岛的蓝色、紫色布”是指对真理和良善的理解。<br />同一先知书：<br />有两个女子，一母的女儿，在埃及、在幼年时行邪淫，就是阿荷拉和阿荷利巴。阿荷拉在我手下行邪淫，贪恋她的邻邦亚述人，穿着蓝衣，作总督、作领袖；骑着马的马兵。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.2.htm">23:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.6.htm">6</a>）<br />“阿荷拉”表示撒玛利亚，“阿荷利巴”表示耶路撒冷（23:4）。“撒玛利亚”是指败坏的属灵教会；“在埃及行邪淫”表示通过记忆知识歪曲真理；“贪恋她的邻邦亚述人”表示热爱基于这些歪曲的推理；“穿着蓝衣”表示源于良善的真理的表象，因为它们源于被错解的圣言字义。<br />类似的话出现在耶利米书：<br />锤炼的银片是从他施带来的，并有从乌法来的金子，都是匠人的工和铸匠的手工。他们的衣服是蓝色和紫色料的。这些都是巧匠的工作。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶10.9.htm">10:9</a>）<br />这论及以色列家的偶像，以色列家的偶像表示通过扭曲圣言的外在意义所确认的虚假教义（参看<a href="9424.htm">9424</a>节）；“匠人的工和铸匠的手工”，以及“这些都是巧匠的工作”表示它们都是自我聪明的产物；“他施来的银片和乌法来的金子”表示从外表上看，它们似乎是真理和良善，因为它们取自圣言；“蓝色和紫色料”，也就是“他们的衣服”，意思也差不多。<br />启示录：<br />我在异象中看见那些马，骑马的有火胸甲，与蓝玛瑙并硫磺，杀了人的三分之一。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启9.17.htm">9:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启9.18.htm">18</a>）<br />“马”和“骑马的”表示对真理的一种颠倒和败坏的理解；“火胸甲，与紫玛瑙并硫磺”表示由恶魔般的爱之邪恶所产生的虚假的防御。因此，“火”在此表示对邪恶的地狱之爱；“蓝”表示对虚假的地狱之爱；因此，它们都是反面意义上的；因为圣言中的大多数事物也有一个反面意义。</p>

And blue. That this signifies the celestial love of truth, is evident from the signification of "blue" [hyacinthinum] as being the celestial love of truth. That "blue" has this signification is because 
it belongs to the color of the sky, and because by this color is signified truth from a celestial origin, which is truth from the good of love to the Lord. This good reigns in the inmost heaven, and 
in the middle or second heaven it is presented to view as crimson and blue; the good itself as crimson, and the derivative truth as blue. For in the other life, and in heaven itself, there appear most 
beautiful colors, all deriving their origin from good and truth. For the sphere of the affections of good and truth is sensibly presented before the eyes of angels and spirits by means of colors, and 
specific things by variously colored objects. They are presented to the nostrils also by means of odors. For everything celestial, which is of good, and everything spiritual, which is of truth, is 
represented in the lower heavens by such things as appear in nature, thus to the very senses of the spirits and angels there. The reason why the spheres of the affection of good and truth are visibly 
presented by means of colors, is that the colors are modifications of heavenly light, thus of intelligence and wisdom (see n. 4530, 4677, 4742, 4922).  [2] This then is the reason why among the things 
that were collected for the tabernacle, and for the garments of Aaron, were blue, crimson, scarlet double-dyed, and skins of red rams; for by the tabernacle was represented the heaven of the Lord, and 
by the things of which it was constructed and woven together were represented the celestial and spiritual things that belong to good and truth; in like manner by the garments of Aaron (n. 9457). This 
is the reason why the veil, within which was the ark of the testimony, was woven of blue, crimson, scarlet double-dyed, and fine linen (Exod. 26:31); in like manner the covering for the door of the 
tent (verse 36), and likewise the covering of the gate of the court (Exod. 27:16); also why the loops upon the edge of the curtain were of blue (Exod. 26:4). Therefore also it was that the ephod was 
of gold, blue, crimson, scarlet double-dyed, and fine linen, all interwoven; and likewise the breastplate of judgment (Exod. 28:6, 15). [3] By "blue" is signified the celestial love of truth, and by 
"garments of blue," the knowledges of truth from this love, in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was thy spread, that it might be to thee for a sign; blue and crimson from the isles 
of Elishah were thy covering. These were thy traders with perfect things, with bales of blue and broidered work, and with treasures of precious garments (Ezek. 27:7, 24); </p>
<p>speaking of Tyre, by which 
are signified the knowledges of truth and good (n. 1201); knowledge and the derivative intelligence are described by "broidered work from Egypt," and by "blue and crimson from the isles of Elishah;" 
"broidered work from Egypt" being the memory-knowledge of truth; "blue and crimson from the isles of Elishah" being the intelligence of truth and good. [4] In the same: </p>
<p>     Two women, the daughters 
of one mother, committed whoredoms in Egypt in their youth, Oholah and Oholibah. Oholah committed whoredom under Me; and doted on the Assyrians her neighbors, clothed in blue, commanders and leaders; 
horsemen riding on horses (Ezek. 23:2-6); </p>
<p>"Oholah" is Samaria, "Oholibah" is Jerusalem (verse 4). "Samaria" here denotes the spiritual church perverted; "committing whoredom in Egypt" denotes falsifying 
truths by means of memory-knowledges; "doting on the Assyrians her neighbors" denotes to love the consequent reasonings; "clothed with blue" denotes the appearances of the truth that is from good, 
because from the literal sense of the Word wrongly unfolded. [5] In like manner in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Silver beaten out is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the smith and of the 
hands of the metal caster; blue and crimson are their clothing; all the work of the wise (Jer. 10:9); </p>
<p>speaking of the idols of the house of Israel, by which are signified false doctrinal things confirmed 
from the external sense of the Word badly unfolded (see n. 9424); "the work of the smith and of the hands of the metal caster," and also "they are all the work of the wise," denote that it was 
from self-intelligence; "silver from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz" denote truth and good so appearing in the external form, because from the Word; in like manner "blue and crimson," which were "their 
clothing." [6] In John: </p>
<p>     I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates as of fire and of blue and of sulphur, by whom was the third part of men killed (Rev. 9:17, 
18); </p>
<p>where "horses and they that sat on them" denote the inverted and perverted understanding of truth; "breastplates as of fire, of blue, and of sulphur" denote the defense of falsities that are 
from the evils of diabolical loves. Here therefore "fire" denotes the infernal love of evil; and "blue" the infernal love of falsity; thus in the opposite sense; for most things in the Word have also 
an opposite sense. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9466</b></p><p><b>9466.</b>
'And violet' means the celestial love of truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'violet' as the celestial love of truth, the reason why 'violet' has this meaning being that it is a celestial colour, 
and by this colour truth from a celestial origin is meant, that is, truth springing from the good of love to the Lord. This good predominates in the inmost heaven, revealing itself in the middle or 
second heaven as the colours purple and violet. The actual good reveals itself as purple, and the truth springing from it as violet. For when colours appear in the next life, and in heaven itself, they 
are most beautiful ones; and they all have their origin in goodness and truth. For the sphere of affections for goodness and truth is revealed to the eyes of angels and of spirits also by means of colours, 
specific things being revealed by means of objects variously coloured, and also to their nostrils by means of odours. For every celestial reality belonging to good or spiritual reality belonging 
to truth is represented in the lower heavens by means of the kinds of things that appear in the natural order, and by this means is revealed to the actual external senses of spirits and angels in those 
heavens. The reason why the spheres of affection for goodness and truth are revealed visually by means of colours is that colours are modifications of heavenly light, and so of intelligence and wisdom, 
see <a href="4530.htm">4530</a>, <a href="4677.htm">4677</a>, <a href="4742.htm">4742</a>, <a href="4922.htm">4922</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This now explains why the materials that were to be gathered together for the tabernacle and Aaron's garments included violet, purple, twice-dyed scarlet, and 
skins of red rams; for the tabernacle represented the Lord's heaven, the materials which were used to construct and cover it represented the celestial and spiritual realities that belong to goodness 
and truth, and Aaron's garments had a like representation, <a href="9457.htm">9457</a>. It explains why the veil within which the ark of the Testimony was placed was woven from violet, purple, twice-dyed scarlet, and fine 
linen thread, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2026:31&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 26:31</a>, as likewise was the covering for the door of the tent, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2026:36&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 26:36</a>, and the covering for the gate of the court as well, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2027:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 27:16</a>, and why the loops on the edge of the curtain 
were made of violet, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2026:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 26:4</a>. It also explains why the ephod was made of gold, violet, purple, twice-dyed scarlet, and linen thread woven together, as was the breastplate of judgement, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2028:6,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 28:6, 15</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 'Violet' means the celestial love of truth, and 'garments made of violet' cognitions or knowledge of truth present as a result of that love, in Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
Fine linen with embroidered 
work from Egypt was your sail, that it might be to you an ensign; violet and purple from the islands of Elishah was your covering. They were your traders with choice wares,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> with balls of violet, and 
embroidery, and with chests of precious garments. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2027:7,%2024&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 27:7, 24</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Tyre, by which cognitions of truth and good are meant, <a href="1201.htm">1201</a>. Knowledge and understanding acquired from these is described 
by 'embroidered work from Egypt', and by 'violet and purple from the islands of Elishah'. 'Embroidered work from Egypt' is factual knowledge of truth, and 'violet and purple from the islands 
of Elishah' is an understanding of truth and good.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
Two women, the daughters of one mother, in their youth committed whoredom in Egypt - Oholah and Oholibah. Oholah committed 
whoredom under Me and doted on the Assyrians her neighbours - clothed in violet, governors and leaders, horsemen riding on horses. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2023:2-6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 23:2-6</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Oholah' stands for Samaria, and 'Oholibah' 
for Jerusalem, Samaria in this instance being the corrupted spiritual Church. 'Committing whoredom in Egypt' means falsifying truths by means of factual knowledge, 'doting on the Assyrians her neighbours' 
stands for having a love of reasonings based on those falsifications, and 'clothed in violet' stands for ideas which look like truth springing from good because they are derived from the literal 
sense of the Word interpreted wrongly.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Something similar occurs in Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the smith and of the hands of the molder. 
Their clothing is violet and purple. These are all the work of the wise. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2010:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 10:9</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the idols of the house of Israel, by which false teachings, supported by distortions of the outward 
sense of the Word, are meant, <a href="9424.htm">9424</a>. 'The work of the smith and of the hands of the molder', and also 'these are all the work of the wise', stand for the fact that they are the product of self-intelligence. 
'Silver from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz' stands for their seeming to outward appearance to be true and good because they are taken from the Word; and much the same is meant by 'violet 
and purple' of which their clothing consisted.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In John,  </p>
<blockquote>
I saw horses in the vision, and those seated on them had breastplates of fire and violet and brimstone, by whom a third part of mankind 
was killed. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%209:17,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 9:17, 18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Horses' and 'those seated on them' stand for a topsy-turvy and corrupted understanding of truth. 'Breastplates of fire, violet, and brimstone' stands for defence of 
falsities that arise from the evils of devilish kinds of love. In this instance therefore 'fire' stands for the hellish love of evil, and 'violet' for the hellish love of falsity. They are accordingly 
used in the contrary sense; for the majority of things in the Word also have a contrary meaning.

`Et hyacinthinum': quod significet caelestem amorem veri, constat ex significatione `hyacinthini' quod sit caelestis amor veri; quod `hyacinthinum' id sit, est quia coloris caelestis est, et per illum 
colorem significatur verum ex origine caelesti, quod est verum ex bono amoris in Dominum; hoc bonum in intimo caelo regnat, et sistit in medio seu secundo caelo colorem purpureum et hyacinthinum; ipsum 
bonum colorem purpureum, ac verum inde colorem hyacinthinum; colores enim in altera vita, inque ipso caelo, apparent pulcherrimi, et omnes originem ex bono et vero ducunt; sphaera enim affectionum 
boni et veri sistitur sensibilis coram oculis angelorum et spirituum etiam per colores, et specifica per objecta varie colorata, et quoque coram naribus per odores; omne enim caeleste quod boni, et 
spirituale quod veri, repraesentatur in inferioribus caelis per talia quae apparent In natura, sic coram ipsis sensibus externis spirituum et angelorum ibi; quod sphaerae affectionis {1}boni et veri sistantur 
visibiles per colores, est causa quia colores {2} sunt modificationes lucis caelestis, ita intelligentiae et sapientiae, videatur n. 4530, 4677, 4742, 4922. 2 Inde nunc est quod inter illa quae
