<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第370节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>370.</strong>创世记4:9 耶和华对该隐说：“你兄弟亚伯在哪里？”他说：“我不知道！我岂是看守我兄弟的吗？”<br />“耶和华对该隐说”表某种内在觉知，该觉知给予他们有关仁或“兄弟亚伯”的指示；该隐回答：“我不知道！我岂是看守我兄弟的吗？”表信认为仁一文不值，不愿屈从于它，因此，信完全拒绝仁的一切，他们的教义变成这样子。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]370.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_370/bible_king-james-version_genesis_4_9" target=_top>Genesis 4:9</a>. And Jehovah said to Cain, "Where is Abel, your brother?" And he said, "I do not know. Am I my brother's guardian?"<br />Jehovah said to Cain means a certain perception from deep down that spoke of charity, which is Abel, your brother. He said, "I do not know. Am I my brother's guardian?" means that he considered charity worthless, not wanting to act as its servant. So it means that he totally rejected anything having to do with charity. This is what their doctrine had become. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 370</b></p><p><b>370.</b>
Verse 9. And Jehovah said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not, am I my brother's keeper? "Jehovah said unto Cain" signifies a certain perceptivity from within that gave them 
a dictate concerning charity or the "brother Abel." Cain's reply, "I know not, am I my brother's keeper?" signifies that faith considered charity as nothing, and was unwilling to be subservient to it, 
consequently that faith altogether rejected everything of charity. Such did their doctrine become. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 370</b></p><p><b>370.</b>
Verse 9 And Jehovah said to Cain, Where is Abel your brother? And he said, I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?  </p>
<p>'Jehovah said to Cain' means a certain perceptivity coming from within, which acted 
as a dictate concerning charity, which is 'Abel your brother'. 'He said, I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?' means that faith regarded charity as worthless and was unwilling to be its servant. 
So it completely rejected anything that was a matter of charity. Such did their doctrine become.  </p>

</p><b>370.</b>
Vers. 9.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Cain, Ubi Habel frater tuus? et dixit, Non scio, an custos fratris mei ego? 'Quod dixerit Jehovah ad Cain' significat perceptivum quoddam ab interiore, quod dictavit de 
charitate seu 'Habele fratre':  'quod dixerit, Non scio, an custos fratris mei ego?' significat quod nihili faceret charitatem, cui non famulari vellet; ita quod rejecerit prorsus quicquid esset charitatis; 
talis facta est eorum doctrina. </p>
