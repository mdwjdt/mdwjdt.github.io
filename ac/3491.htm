THE INTERNAL SENSE Verse 1. And it came to pass that Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim that he could not see; and he called Esau his elder son, and said unto him, My son; and he said unto him, Behold 
me. "And it came to pass that Isaac was old," signifies when the state was at hand; "and his eyes were dim that he could not see," signifies when the rational desired to enlighten the natural with 
the Divine; "and he called Esau his elder son," signifies the affection of the good of the natural, or the good of life; "and said unto him, My son; and he said unto him, Behold me," signifies presence 
from being foreseen and provided. </p>

<p>Verse 1 And so it was, that Isaac was old and his eyes were becoming dark so that he could not see; and he called Esau his elder son and said to him, My son; and he said to him, 
Here I am. </p>

the Divine. 'And he called Esau his elder son' means the affection for natural good, or the good of life. 'And he said to him, My son; and he said to him, Here I am' means presence as the result of foresight 
and provision. </p>

<p>Vers. I.  Et fuit, quod senuit Jishak, et caligabant oculi ejus a videndo, et vocavit Esavum filium suum majorem, et dixit ad eum, Fili mi, et dixit ad eum, Ecce me. `Fuit quod senuit 
Jishak' significat cum status adesset: `et caligabant oculi ejus a videndo' significat cum Rationale vellet illustrare Naturale Divino: `et vocavit Esavum filium suum majorem' significat affectionem 
boni naturalis seu bonum vitae: `et dixit ad eum, Fili mi; et dixit ad eum, Ecce me' significat ex praeviso et proviso praesentiam. </p>
