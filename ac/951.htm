<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第951节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>951.</strong>那些在世时自以为神圣之人在左脚前的低地。有时他们似乎有一张闪闪发光的脸，这是从他们自以为神圣的观念流出的。但结果是，他们被留在低地，最强烈的渴望就是升入天堂，他们以为天堂在高处。他们的渴望日益强烈，并变成一种焦虑，这焦虑会急剧增长，直到他们承认他们并不神圣。当被带出那个地方时，他们能觉察到自己可怕的恶臭。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]951.</strong> People who considered themselves saintly during bodily life are in an underground region in front of the left foot.{*1} There it sometimes seems to them that they have shining faces — an effect that stems from their picture of sainthood. The outcome for them, however, is that they remain there in the grip of a strong urge to climb to heaven, which they think is up high. Their desire swells and is gradually transformed into anxiety, which increases beyond all measure, until at last they acknowledge that they are not saints.<br />When released from there, they are allowed to smell their own stench, which is disgusting.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For more on the "underground region" (Latin terra inferior) in the spiritual world, see note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_951/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_247" target=_top>247</a>.

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 951</b></p><p><b>951.</b>
Those who in the life of the body have thought themselves holy, are in the lower earth before the left foot. At times they there appear to themselves to have a shining face, which flows from their idea 
of their own holiness. But the outcome with them is that they are kept in the most intense desire to ascend into heaven, which they suppose to be on high. This desire is increased and is turned more 
and more into anxiety, which grows immensely until they acknowledge that they are not holy; and when they are taken out of that place, they are enabled to perceive their own stench, which is very offensive. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 951</b></p><p><b>951.</b>
People who during their lifetime have imagined themselves to be holy are on the lower earth in front of the left foot. On occasions they seem to themselves there to have a shining face, which is a product 
of such notions of their own holiness. But the outcome for them is that they are kept there, on the lower earth, in the greatest desire to rise up into heaven, which they imagine to be up on high. 
Their desire grows and is converted more and more into an anxiety which increases enormously till they acknowledge that they are not holy. When they are taken away from that place they are allowed 
to perceive their own stench, which is dreadful. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 951</b>
</p><b>951.</b>
Qui se sanctos putarunt in vita corporis, sunt in terra inferiore ante pedem sinistrum; ibi apparent sibi quandoque facie lucentes, quod profluit ex ideis sanctitatis eorum; sed exitus eorum est quod 
teneantur ibi in maxima cupidine ascendendi in caelum, quod putant esse in alto; cupido eorum augetur et vertitur magis et magis in anxietatem, quae crescit in immensum usque dum agnoscunt quod non 
sancti sint: cum inde eximuntur, sentire iis datur fetorem sui, qui est graveolentus. </p>
