<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4227节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4227.</strong>有许多男女在世时具有这样的秉性：尽可能地利用诡计和骗术来征服其他人的心灵，目的是控制他们，尤其试图控制那些有权有钱的人，以便唯独以他们的名义进行统治。这些人行事诡秘，排除其他人，尤其正直的人，并且手段多种多样：事实上，他们不会谴责正直的人，因为正直会自我防卫；而是用其它方法，如歪曲他们的建议，称其简单而邪恶；当有不幸发生时，便将其归咎于他们，此外还有其它类似伎俩。凡活在肉身时就具有这种秉性的人，到了来世仍是那样，因为每个人的生命都跟随着他。<br />我从这类灵人与我在一起时，在他们中间活生生的经历知道这一切，因为那时他们还是如此行事，只是更巧妙、更狡诈了；事实上，灵人行事远比世人狡猾得多，因为他们解除了与身体的一切联系，摆脱了粗糙的感觉模式的束缚。他们如此巧妙，以致我有时意识不到他们的意图和目的是要实施操控；他们自己彼此交谈时，会小心提防，不让我听到或意识到他们在说什么。不过，听到他们说话的其他人告诉我，他们的提议不堪入耳；他们正盘算着利用法术、因而在魔鬼团伙的帮助下如何达到自己的目的。他们认为杀害正直的人没什么大不了的。至于主（他们声称，他们想奉主名实施操控），他们并没有把祂看得有多高，只是视祂为另一个凡人，认为对祂的敬拜是古时留下来的习俗，类似于视人为神明并敬拜他们的其它民族当中的习俗。然而，他们不敢出言反对祂，因为他们就生在这种敬拜中，反对祂会损害自己的名声。关于这些灵人，我可以这样说：他们迷惑、困扰了像他们那样的人，并渗入其情感和意图中，以致若不是主仁慈，这些人绝无可能知道这类灵人的存在，并且他们自己就在这类灵人的社群中。<br />这些灵人就对应于人的纯净血液中的有害成分，被称作动物灵（animal spirit），这些有害成分便毫无秩序地进入动物灵。它们散布于各处，就像毒药，冻结并麻痹神经和纤维，由此爆发最严重、致命的疾病。当这类灵人彼此联合行动时，人从以下事实知道他们的行动：他们以四足动物（四足动物没有手，只有脚，脚对应于人里面最低级、最外在的事物）的方式趴下来，驻扎在小脑左侧下面的后脑勺。因为在后脑勺下面行动的灵人活动比其他人更隐秘；并且那些作用于背后部位的人渴望实施操控。<br />关于主，他们与我争辩说，意想不到的是，当他们祷告时，祂并没有垂听他们的祷告，因而并没有帮助那些寻求帮助的人。但我被允许回答说，他们不可能被垂听，因为他们以诸如反对人类福祉的那种事为自己的目的；还因为他们为自己的兴旺而祷告，却反对其他所有人。当他们以这种方式祷告时，我补充说，天堂是关闭的，因为天上的人唯独关注那些正在祷告之人的目的。这些灵人当然不会认可我所说的，只是无言以对。<br />我曾遇到这类男灵人与一些女人在一起，声称他们会听从女人所提出的许多建议，因为这些女人能更迅速、更精明地洞察这类事。他们尤其喜欢与曾当过妓女的女人在一起。在来世，这类人绝大部分投入到秘密的法术中，来世有许许多多这样的法术，在世上完全不为人知。具有这种性质的人一进入来世，就投入到这些法术中，学习如何迷住与他们在一起的人，尤其那些他们渴望以其名义进行统治的人。他们并不憎恶邪恶的行径。他们的地狱及其性质，也就是他们不在灵人界时的居所，将在别处予以讨论。由此可见，死后，每个人的生命仍伴随着他。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4227</b></p><p><b>4227.</b>
There are many of both sexes who in this life have been of such a character that whenever possible they sought by art and deceit to subjugate to themselves the minds of others, with the end of ruling 
over them, especially those who were powerful and rich, in order that they alone might rule in their name; and who had acted in a secret manner, and had removed other men, especially the upright, and 
this in various ways-not indeed by censuring them, for uprightness defends itself; but by other modes, such as by misrepresenting their suggestions by calling these simple and evil; and by attributing 
to them any misfortunes that might occur; together with other similar detractions. They who have been of this character in the life of the body are the same in the other life, for the life of everyone 
follows him. [2] I discovered this by living experience among such spirits when they have been with me, for they then acted in a similar manner, but still more craftily and ingeniously; for spirits 
act more subtly than men, being released from all connection with the body, and from the bonds of gross modes of sensation. They were so subtle that sometimes I did not perceive that their intention 
and end was to exercise command; and when they spoke among themselves they took care that I should not hear and perceive it; but I was told by others who heard them that their designs were wicked; and 
that they were studying to attain their end by magic arts, and thus by assistance from the diabolical crew. The murder of the upright they accounted as a matter of no moment; and as for the Lord (under 
whom they said that they desired to exercise command), they made Him very cheap, regarding Him merely as another man, to whom worship is paid by ancient custom, as among other nations which made men 
gods and worshiped them, and whom they durst not speak against, because they were born in that worship, and would thereby injure their reputation. Concerning these spirits I am able to state that they 
obsess the thoughts and the will of the men who are like them, and insinuate themselves into their affection and intention, so that without the Lord's mercy the men cannot possibly know that such 
spirits are present, and that they themselves are in a society of such. [3] These spirits correspond to the corruptions of man's purer blood, called the animal spirit, into which corruptions enter in 
a disorderly manner; and wherever they diffuse themselves they are like poisons which induce cold and torpor upon the nerves and fibers, from which break forth the most grievous and fatal diseases. When 
such act together in company, they are known by their acting-so to speak-in a quadruped manner,* and they beset the back of the head under the cerebellum to the left; for they who act under the occiput 
operate more clandestinely than others, and they who act upon the back parts desire to exercise command.  [4] They reasoned with me about the Lord, and said that it was strange that when they prayed 
He did not hear their prayers, and thus did not aid those who made supplication. But I was permitted to reply that they could not be heard, because they had as their end such things as are contrary 
to the welfare of the human race; and because they pray for themselves against all others; and that when they pray in this manner heaven is closed, for they who are in heaven attend solely to the 
ends of those who are praying. These things they indeed would not acknowledge, but still they could make no answer. [5] I have met male spirits of this kind who were accompanied by some of the female 
sex, and who said that they can avail themselves of many of the suggestions of women, because these are more quick-witted and deft in seeing how to manage such matters. These men are greatly pleased 
with the society of women who had been harlots. In the other life such persons for the most part apply themselves to secret and magical arts; for a host of such arts are there known which are quite unknown 
in this world; and no sooner do persons of this character arrive in the other life than they apply themselves to these arts, and learn to fascinate those with whom they are, and especially those 
under whom they desire to reign. For wicked deeds they have no abhorrence. Their hell, and the nature of this their abode when not in the world of spirits, shall be spoken of elsewhere. From all that 
has been said it is evident that after death every man's life remains with him. * That is, with "a quadruplicate step, so that the sound is like a quadruped" (Spiritual Experiences 1031, 1127). The 
reason why the speech and action of such spirits is attended with this bestial sound is doubtless on account of the abnormal development within them of what is merely natural. A quadruped has no hands, 
but only feet, and the feet correspond to that which is lowest and most external in man. [Reviser.] </p>
<p>4228. The subject of the grand man and correspondence will be continued at the end of the following 
chapter, where correspondence with the senses in general will be treated of. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4227</b></p><p><b>4227.</b>
There are many people of both sexes who whenever possible during their lifetime have been the sort to try by the use of craft and deceit to subjugate the minds of others to themselves with the intent 
of exercising control over them, trying to do so in particular among the powerful and the rich in order that they alone might rule in the name of the powerful or rich. They have acted secretly, and by 
various methods have removed others, especially the upright, not indeed by bringing discredit on them, for uprightness can take care of itself, but by other methods - by distorting what they suggest, 
calling them simpletons and also 'a bad lot', attributing misfortunes to them when these occur, besides other similar practices. People who have behaved like this during their lifetime are just the 
same in the next life, for everyone's life follows him. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 I have come to know all this from actual experience of spirits of this sort when they have been with me, for at that time they acted in a 
similar manner but even more expertly and craftily - for spirits act more skillfully than men do because they have been released from all connection with the body and from being shackled to gross modes 
of sensation. They were so skillful that on some occasions I did not perceive that their intention or end in view was to exercise control; and while talking among themselves they took care that I did 
not hear or realize what they were saying. But I was told by others who did hear them that their proposals were unspeakable, and that they were planning by the use of the arts of magic, and so with 
the aid of the devil's crew, how to attain their end. They thought nothing of murdering the upright; and as for the Lord in whose name they said that they wished to exercise control, they did not rate 
Him highly at all but regarded Him as just another human being, the worship of whom was a practice left over from ancient times, akin to that which existed among other nations who treated and worshipped 
human beings as gods. Yet they did not dare to decry Him because they had been born to that worship of Him, and if they did decry Him they would damage their own reputation. Of these spirits I can 
say this, that they beset the thoughts and will of people who are like themselves and worm their way into their affection and intention in such a manner that, but for the Lord's mercy, those persons 
cannot possibly know that such spirits are present or that they are within a community of such spirits. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 These spirits correspond to the harmful elements present in man's purer blood, termed the 
animal spirit, into which those elements enter without any order. They spread everywhere and are like poisons, freezing and putting out of action nerves and fibres, from which very serious and fatal 
diseases break out. When such spirits act in combination with one another, one knows that they do so from the fact that they go down on all fours, so to speak, and station themselves, at the back of 
one's head below the left side of the cerebellum. For spirits who act below the back of the head work in a more clandestine way than others; and those whose activity is directed on one's back desire to 
exercise control. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 They have reasoned with me regarding the Lord, saying that it was extraordinary He did not hear their prayers when they prayed and so did not come to the aid of those asking 
for help. But I was led to reply that they could not be heard because they had as their end in view such things as were contrary to the health of the human race and because they prayed for their own 
prosperity against that of all others. And when they prayed in this fashion, I added, heaven was closed, for those in heaven pay attention solely to the ends which those praying have in view. These spirits 
certainly did not wish to acknowledge anything I said; nevertheless they could not find anything to say in reply. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 There have been some men of this kind, accompanied by women, who said that 
they could follow many suggestions made by the women because women have a quicker and shrewder insight into such matters. They were especially delighted to have the company of those who had been whores. 
Such apply themselves in the next life to secret and magical arts for the most part, for very many magical arts exist in the next life which are totally unknown in the world. As soon as people of 
this nature enter the next life they apply themselves to those arts and learn how to bewitch those with whom they are present, especially those in whose name they wish to bear rule. They have no abhorrence 
of wicked ways. The nature of their hell and where they are when not in the world of spirits will be discussed elsewhere. From all this it may be seen that everyone's life remains with him after death. </p>

</p><b>4227.</b>
Sunt plures ex utroque sexu qui tales in vita corporis fuerunt ut ubicumque potuerint, quaesiverint arte et dolo subjugare sibi aliorum animos fine imperandi, cumprimis apud potentes et divites ut 
soli essent qui sub nomine illorum regerent, quique clam egerunt et removerunt alios, imprimis probos, et hoc variis modis, quidem non vituperando quia probitas semet defendit, sed per modos alios, 
eorum consilia pervertendo, vocando simplicia et quoque mala, attribuendo infortunia si quae fiunt, praeter alia similia: </p>
<p>qui tales fuerunt in vita corporis, etiam tales sunt in altera vita, nam 
unumquemque sequitur vita sua; [2] per vivam experientiam ab hujuscemodi, cum apud me fuerunt, id comperii, quia {1} similiter tunc agebant, sed adhuc solertius et ingeniosius, nam spiritus subtilius 
agunt quam homines, quia a nexibus cum corpore {2} et (c)a vinculis cum crassis sensationum modis, soluti sunt; </p>
<p>illi ita subtiles erant ut aliquoties non perceperim {3} quod intentio seu finis 
imperandi illis esset; et cum inter se loquebantur, cavebant ne audirem et id perciperem; sed ab aliis qui audiverunt, mihi dictum quod nefanda essent consilia eorum, et quod per magicas artes, ita 
per opem a diabolica turba, studerent pervenire ad finem suum; neces proborum pro nihilo aestimabant; </p>
<p>Dominum, sub Quo imperare se velle dicebant, vilipendebant, (t)Ipsum modo ut alium hominem spectando, 
cui cultus sicut apud alias gentes quae homines deos fecerunt et coluerunt {4}, ab antiquo manens {5}, et cui contradicere, quia nati in illo cultu, (o)et famam laederent, non ausi fuerint: 
de illis id dicere possum quod cogitationes et voluntatem hominum qui similes sunt, obsideant, ac apud illos se insinuent eorum affectioni et intentioni, sic ut illi nequaquam scire possint,{6} absque 
Domini misericordia, quod tales spiritus adsint, et quod in societate talium sint.  [3] Hi {7} spiritus correspondent vitiosis sanguinis purioris apud hominem qui sanguis spiritus animalis vocatur, 
quem vitiosa intrant absque ordine, et `ubicumque' se diffundunt, {8} sunt sicut venena quae frigus inducunt {9}, et torporem nervis et fibris {10}, ex quibus erumpunt morbi gravissimi et fatales. 
 Cum tales in consortio agunt, internoscuntur per id quod modo quadrupedo, ut ita dicatur, agant, et quod insideant (t)parti posteriori capitis sub cerebello ad sinistrum; qui enim sub occipitio 
agunt {11}, clandestine magis quam alii operantur, et qui ad partem tergalem, imperare cupiunt. [4] Ratiocinati sunt mecum de Domino, et dicebant quod mirum sit quod non audiat preces quando precantur, 
et (t)sic quod non opituletur supplicantibus, sed respondere datum quod non audiri possent, quia pro fine habent talia quae contraria sunt saluti generis humani et quia precantur pro semet 
contra omnes, et cum ita precantur quod claudatur caelum, `qui enim in caelo sunt, solum attendunt ad fines precantium'; haec quidem non agnoscere volebant, sed usque nihil potuerunt respondere. 
 [5] Erant viri hujus sortis {12}, et illi cum feminis in consortio, qui dicebant quod a feminis plura consilia possent capere, quia citiores et solertiores perspiciendi talia essent; </p>
<p>admodum delectantur 
consortio illarum {13} quae scorta fuerunt. Tales ut plurimum ad secretas artes et magicas in altera vita se applicant, nam magicae artes in altera vita sunt perplures quae in mundo prorsus 
ignotae sunt, ejuscemodi ut primum in alteram vitam veniunt, se applicant, et discunt fascinare illos apud quos sunt, imprimis sub quibus regnare cupiunt; nefaria non abhorrent. De inferno illorum 
(o)quale est et ubi sunt quando non in mundo spirituum, alibi dicetur.  Ex his constare potest quod vita sua unumquemque {14} maneat post mortem.      @1 nam$      @2 corporeis$      @3 sciverim$
