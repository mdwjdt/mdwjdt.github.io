<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第776节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>776.</strong>“一切禽鸟，各从其类”表一切属灵真理，“一切飞行物”表属世真理，“一切带翅膀的物”表感官真理。这一点从前面有关鸟的说明清楚可知（如<a href="40.htm">40</a>节）。上古之人将人的思维比作鸟，因为相对意愿之物而言，思维好比鸟。由于此处提到了鸟、飞行物和带翅膀的物，并且它们分别象人的觉性、理性和感官印象，所以为了使人不再质疑它们表示这些事物，我引用圣言中的一些经文加以证实，从中可以清楚看出，“牲畜”表示诸如已说过的这类事物。如诗篇：<br />你派祂管理你手所造的，使万物，就是一切的牛羊、田野的牲畜、空中的飞行物、海里的鱼，都服在祂的脚下。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗8.6.htm">8:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗8.8.htm">8</a>）<br />这论及的是主，并以这样的方式描述祂管理人，以及属于人的一切。否则，“管理牲畜和鸟”会是什么呢？<br />结果的树木和一切香柏树，野兽和一切牲畜、爬行物和飞行物，它们赞美耶和华的名。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗148.9.htm">148:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗148.10.htm">10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗148.13.htm">13</a>）<br />“结果的树木”是属天之人，“香柏树”是属灵之人，“野兽”、“牲畜”和“爬行物”就目前的语境来看，是指他们各自的良善。“飞行物”是他们的真理，他们由此能“赞美耶和华的名”。野兽、牲畜、爬行物和鸟绝不会这样做。在世俗的着作中，这类陈述可能是夸张的说法，但在圣言中，它们绝不仅仅是夸张，还是有象征性和代表性的事物。<br />以西结书：<br />海中的鱼、天空的鸟、田野的野兽，并土地上的一切爬行物和地面上的众人，他们都开始在我面前震动。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结38.20.htm">38:20</a>）<br />显而易见，此处的“野兽”和“鸟”就有这样的含义。因为若鱼、鸟和野兽要开始震动，那耶和华的荣耀会是什么呢？如果它们不象征它们里面的神圣事物，谁会认为这类说法是神圣的？耶利米书：<br />我观看，看哪，无人； 空中的飞鸟也都躲避。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.25.htm">4:25</a>）<br />这表示一切善与真。此处“人”也表示源自爱的良善。同一先知书：<br />它们都已荒废，以致无人经过。人也听不见牲畜鸣叫，从空中的飞鸟到野兽，它们都已散去跑掉了。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶9.10.htm">9:10</a>）<br />这同样表示背离一切真理与良善。<br /><br />这陆地悲哀，遍野的青草枯干，要到几时呢？因其上居民的恶行，牲畜和飞鸟都灭绝了。因为人们说，祂看不见我们的结局。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶12.4.htm">12:4</a>）<br />“牲畜”表良善，“飞鸟”表真理，它们都灭绝了。西番雅书：<br />我必除灭人和牲畜，我必除灭空中的鸟、海里的鱼，以及绊脚石和恶人；我必将人从地面上剪除。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番1.3.htm">1:3</a>）<br />“人和牲畜”表属于爱和爱之善的一切，“空中的鸟、海里的鱼”表那些属于觉知，因而属于真理之物。这些被称为“绊脚石”是因为，对恶人而言，成为绊脚石的，正是良善和真理，而非牲畜和鸟。它们明显是论及人。诗篇：<br />耶和华的树，就是祂所栽种的黎巴嫩香柏树，都得到了充分的灌溉。飞行物搭窝于其中。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.16.htm">104:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.17.htm">17</a>）<br />“耶和华的树，就是黎巴嫩的香柏树”表属灵之人，“飞行物”表他的理性或属世真理，它们好比“窝”。而且，“鸟搭窝于枝子中”是人们用来表示真理的常用说法。如以西结书：<br />我要把它栽种在以色列的高山上，它就生枝子，结果子，成为佳美的香柏树，各类飞行物都必宿在其下，就是宿在枝子的荫下。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结17.23.htm">17:23</a>）<br />这表示外邦人中的教会，它是属灵的，就是“佳美的香柏树”。“各类飞鸟”表各类真理。同一先知书：<br />空中的一切飞鸟都在枝子上搭窝；田野的一切野兽都在枝条下生产；所有大国的人民都在它荫下居住。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结31.6.htm">31:6</a>）<br />这是指亚述，就是属灵的教会，被称为“香柏树”。“ 空中的飞鸟”表它的真理，“野兽”表它的良善。<br />但以理书：<br />它的枝子华美，果子甚多，可作其上众生的食物。田野的野兽在它之下得到荫影，空中的飞行物宿在枝上。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但4.12.htm">4:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但4.21.htm">21</a>）<br />“野兽”表良善，“空中的飞行物”表真理。每个人都很清楚这一点，否则，居于那里的鸟和野兽真会是别的什么吗？这同样适用于主所说的话：神的国好像一粒芥菜种，人取来种在自己的园中，它遂生长起来，成了大树，空中的飞鸟宿在它的枝上（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.19.htm">13:19</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.31.htm">13:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.32.htm">32</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可4.31.htm">4:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可4.32.htm">32</a>）。</p>

Cooper(2008,2013)</b></p>
<p><strong>[NCE]776.</strong> The symbolism of every kind of bird as all spiritual truth, the flying thing as earthly truth, and the winged creature as truth gained through the senses can be seen from what was said and shown earlier about birds, at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_776/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_40" target=_top>40</a>.<br />The earliest people compared human thoughts to birds, because that is what thought is like, relative to the activity of the will.<br />The bird, flying thing, and winged creature mentioned here come one after the other in the same way different levels of mental activity do in humans; we can understand things, reason, and use our physical senses. To overcome all doubt that they symbolize these processes, let me bring forward several more passages from the Word in confirmation. (The passages will also show that animals symbolize just what they were said to.)<br />[2] In David:<br />You have made him rule over the works of your hands; all things you have put under his feet: the flock and all the herds, and also the animals of the fields, the flying thing in the heavens, and the fish in the sea. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_776/bible_king-james-version_psalms_8_6-7" target=_top>Psalms 8:6-7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_776/bible_king-james-version_psalms_8_8" target=_top>8</a>)<br />This speaks of the Lord, describing his rule over us and over the things that are in us. What would governance over animals and birds be, if not this? In the same author:<br />The fruit tree and all cedars, the wild animal and every beast, the creeping thing, and the flying creature on the wing will give glory to Jehovah's name. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_776/bible_king-james-version_psalms_148_9-10" target=_top>Psalms 148:9-10</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_776/bible_king-james-version_psalms_148_13" target=_top>13</a>)<br />The fruit tree is a heavenly person, the cedar is a spiritual person. The wild animal, beast, and creeping thing are their good qualities (as in the current verses) and the flying thing on the wing is their true ideas. With these they can give glory to Jehovah's name — which a wild animal, beast, creeping thing, or flying creature could never do. Secular writers can use expressions like these as high-flown figures of speech, but the Lord's Word never uses them that way; it uses them only to symbolize or represent something deeper.{*1} [3] In Ezekiel:<br />The fish of the sea and the bird of the heavens and the wild animal of the field and every creeping thing creeping on the ground and every human who is on the face of the ground will tremble before me. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_776/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_38_20" target=_top>Ezekiel 38:20</a>)<br />Obviously the animals and birds here are the kinds of symbols I have described, because what glory would there be for Jehovah in the trembling of fish, birds, and beasts? Can anyone imagine that such wording would be holy if it had no sacred content? In Jeremiah:<br />I looked and there, not a human! Every bird of the heavens had fled. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_776/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_4_25" target=_top>Jeremiah 4:25</a>)<br />This stands for the fact that everything good and true had fled. The human here also stands for the good that comes of love. In the same author:<br />Those places have been laid waste, so that not a man is passing through, and they do not hear the call of any livestock. From the bird in the heavens to the beast, they have wandered away, they have left. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_776/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_9_10" target=_top>Jeremiah 9:10</a>)<br />This too stands for the fact that everything true and good has departed.<br />[4] In the same author:<br />How long will the land mourn and the grass of every field wither? Because of the wickedness of those living in it, the animals and the bird have perished, since they said, "He will not see our latter days." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_776/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_12_4" target=_top>Jeremiah 12:4</a>)<br />The animals stand for goodness and the bird for truth, both of which have perished. In Zephaniah:<br />I will consume human and animal, I will consume the bird in the heavens and the fish in the sea and stumbling blocks in the godless, and I will cut humanity off from the face of the ground. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_776/bible_king-james-version_zephaniah_1_3" target=_top>Zephaniah 1:3</a>)<br />The human and animal stand for the things that belong to love and to the good that springs from love. The bird in the heavens and the fish in the sea stand for what belongs to the intellect and so for matters of truth. These are called stumbling blocks because goodness and truth — not animals and birds — are obstacles for the godless. It also says clearly that they are things existing in humanity. In David:<br />The trees of Jehovah and cedars of Lebanon that he planted, where the flying things nest, receive their fill. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_776/bible_king-james-version_psalms_104_16-17" target=_top>Psalms 104:16-17</a>)<br />The trees of Jehovah and cedars of Lebanon stand for spiritual people. The flying things stand for their rational and earthly truth. These kinds of truth are like nests.<br />[5] In other places, the birds nested in the branches was a common turn of speech symbolizing truth. In Ezekiel, for example:<br />On a high mountain in Israel I will plant it, and it will lift its branch and make fruit and become a majestic cedar. And every flying creature of every wing will live under it; in the shade of its branches they will live. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_776/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_17_23" target=_top>Ezekiel 17:23</a>)<br />This image stands for the church among non-Jews — a spiritual church, which is what the majestic cedar means.{*2} The bird of every wing stands for truth of every kind. In the same author:<br />In its branches nested every bird of the heavens, and under its branches bred every wild animal of the field, and in its shade lived all the great nations. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_776/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_31_6" target=_top>Ezekiel 31:6</a>)<br />This concerns Assyria, which is a spiritual church and is called a cedar. The bird of the heavens stands for the truth that church had, and the animals stand for its goodness.<br />[6] In Daniel:<br />Its branch was beautiful and its fruit plentiful, and nourishment for all was in it. Under it the animal of the field found shade, and in its branches lived the flying creatures of heaven. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_776/bible_king-james-version_daniel_4_12" target=_top>Daniel 4:12</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_776/bible_king-james-version_daniel_4_21" target=_top>21</a>)<br />The animal stands for goodness, and the flying creature of the heavens for truth, as anyone can see. What would be the point of saying that birds and animals lived there? Similar meaning lies in the Lord's words:<br />The kingdom of God is like a mustard seed that a person took and threw into the garden; and it grew and turned into a large tree, so that the birds of the sky lived in its branches. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_776/bible_king-james-version_luke_13_19" target=_top>Luke 13:19</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_776/bible_king-james-version_matthew_13_1-58" target=_top>Matthew 13</a>: [31,] 32; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_776/bible_king-james-version_mark_4_1-41" target=_top>Mark 4</a>: [31,] 32)<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For a similarly emphatic distinction between mere metaphor and the living correspondence of biblical imagery, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_776/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_8989#subsection-2-11" target=_top>8989:11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_776/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_9272#subsection-2-2" target=_top>9272:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_776/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_9828#subsection-2-4" target=_top>9828:4</a>.

That "every fowl after its kind" signifies every spiritual truth, "flying thing" natural truth, and "winged thing" sensuous truth, is evident from what has been stated and shown before concerning "birds" 
(as at n. 40). The most ancient people likened man's thoughts to birds, because relatively to the things of the will, thoughts are like birds. As mention is made here of "fowl" "flying thing" and 
"winged thing" and of these in succession, like things intellectual, rational, and sensuous in man, in order that no one may doubt that they signify these things, some passages from the Word may be adduced 
in confirmation, from which it will also be plain that "beasts" signify such things as have been stated.  [2] Thus in David: </p>
<p>     Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of Thy hands: 
Thou hast put all things under his feet; all sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the fields, the fowl of the heaven, and the fish of the sea (Ps. 8:6-8). This is said of the Lord, whose dominion 
over man, and over the things pertaining to man, is thus described. Otherwise what would be the dominion over "beasts" and "fowls?" Again: </p>
<p>     Fruitful trees and all cedars, the wild animal and every 
beast, creeping things and flying fowl, let them praise the name of Jehovah (Ps. 148:9-10, 13). The "fruitful tree" denotes the celestial man; the "cedar" the spiritual man. The "wild animal" and "beast" 
and "creeping thing" are their goods, as in the history before us; the "flying fowl" is their truths; from all of which they can "praise the name of Jehovah." By no means can the wild animal, the 
beast, the creeping thing, and the bird do this. In profane writings such things may be said by hyperbolism, but there are no hyperbolisms in the Word of the Lord, but things significative and representative. 
 [3] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     The fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the wild animal of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon 
the face of the earth, shall shake at My presence (Ezek. 38:20). That such things are here signified by "beasts" and "fowls" is very manifest; for how would it be to the glory of Jehovah if fishes, 
birds, and beasts should shake? Can anyone suppose that such sayings would be holy if they did not involve holy things? In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     I beheld, and lo there was no man, and all the birds of the 
heavens were fled (Jer. 4:25),  denoting all good and truth; "man" also denotes here the good of love. Again: They are burned up, so that none passeth through, neither can men hear the voice of the 
cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled, they are gone (Jer. 9:10), denoting in like manner that all truth and good have departed. [4] And again: </p>
<p>     How long shall the land mourn, 
and the herb of every field wither? for the wickedness of them that dwell therein the beasts are consumed and the birds, because they said, He shall not see our latter end (Jer. 12:4). Here the 
"beasts" denote goods, and the "birds" truths, which perished. In Zephaniah: </p>
<p>     I will consume man and beast, I will consume the fowls of the heaven and the fishes of the sea, and the stumbling-blocks 
with the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the face of the ground (Zeph. 1:3). Here "man and beast" denote the things which are of love and of its good; the "fowls of the heaven and the fishes 
of the sea" the things which are of the understanding, thus which are of truth. These are called "stumbling-blocks" because goods and truths are stumbling-blocks to the wicked, but not beasts and 
birds; and they are also plainly spoken of "man." In David: </p>
<p>     The trees of Jehovah are satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon which He hath planted, where the birds make their nests (Ps. 104:16-17). The 
"trees of Jehovah" and the "cedars of Lebanon" denote the spiritual man; the "birds" his rational or natural truths, which are as "nests." [5] It was moreover a common form of expression that "birds 
would make their nests in the branches" signifying truths, as in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it, and it shall lift up its bough, and bear fruit, and be a goodly 
cedar; and under it shall dwell every bird of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell (Ezek. 17:23), denoting the Church of the Gentiles, which was spiritual. This is "the 
goodly cedar;" the "bird of every wing" denotes truths of every kind. Again:  All the birds of the heavens made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches all the wild animals of the field brought 
forth, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations (Ezek. 31:6). This is said of Asshur, which is the spiritual church and is called a "cedar;" the " birds of the heavens" denote its truths; 
the "beasts" its goods. In Daniel: </p>
<p>     The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and it was meat for all; the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of heaven dwelt in 
the branches thereof (Dan. 4:12, 21). Here the "beasts" denote goods, the "fowls of the heavens" truths, as must be evident to everyone; for otherwise of what concern is it that the bird and the beasts 
dwelt there? And it is the same with what the Lord says: </p>
<p>     The kingdom of God is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and cast into his garden, and it grew, and became a tree, 
and the birds of the heaven lodged in the branches thereof (Luke 13:19; Matt. 13:31, 32; Mark 4:31, 32). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 776</b></p><p><b>776.</b>
'[Every] bird according to its kind' means all spiritual truth, 'flying things' means natural truth, and 'winged thing' sensory truth. This is clear from what has been stated and shown already about 
birds, as in <a href="40.htm">40</a>. The most ancient people likened man's thoughts to birds, for in relation to things of the will, thoughts are like birds. Since bird, flying thing, and winged thing are mentioned here, 
and come consecutively in the way that intellectual concepts, rational concepts, and sensory impressions do in man, and to prevent anyone doubting that this is what they mean, let other places from the 
Word of a confirmatory nature be quoted, from which as well it will be evident that 'beasts' means such things as have been stated. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In David, </p>
<blockquote>
You have given Him dominion over the works of 
Your hands; You have put all things under His feet, flocks and all cattle, and also the beasts of the fields, the flying things of the air,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and the fish of the sea. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%208:6-8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 8:6-8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the 
Lord, whose dominion over man and over what belongs to man is described in this fashion. If this were not so, what would 'dominion over beasts and birds' really be? In the same author,  </p>
<blockquote>
Fruit tree 
and all cedars, wild animal and every beast, creeping thing and flying thing - they shall glorify the name of Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20148:9,%2010,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 148:9, 10, 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Fruit tree' is the celestial man, 'cedar' the spiritual man, 
'wild animal and beast and creeping thing' the goods of these kinds of man, as in the present context. 'Flying thing' is their truths from which they are able to glorify the name of Jehovah. This a 
wild animal, a beast, a creeping thing, or a flying thing can never do. In secular literature such statements can be used as hyperbole, but in the Word of the Lord they are never just hyperbole but meaningful 
signs and representatives. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
They start to tremble before Me - the fish of the sea, and the birds of the air,<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> and the wild animals of the field, and every creeping thing 
creeping over the ground, and every man that is on the face<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> of the ground. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2038:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 38:20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that 'beasts' and 'birds' here have such meanings is quite clear, for what would Jehovah's glory 
be if fish, birds, and beasts were to start to tremble? Could anyone think that such utterances are holy if they did not embody holy things within them? In Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
I looked, and behold, there 
was no man; all the birds of the air<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> had fled. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%204:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 4:15</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This stands for all good and truth. Here 'man' stands as well for good that stems from love. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
They have been laid 
waste so that no man passes through, neither do men hear the voice of the herd. From the birds of the air<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> down to beasts, they have scattered, they have gone away. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%209:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 9:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This in a similar way 
stands for the departure of all truth and good.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>

How long will the land mourn and the grass of every field wither? For the wickedness of those who dwell in it, the beasts

<p>Here 'beasts' stands for goods, and 'birds' for truths, which perished. In Zephaniah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will consume man 
and beast, I will consume the birds of the air<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> and the fish of the sea, and the stumbling-blocks with the wicked; and I will cut off mankind from the face<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a> of the ground. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zeph%201:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zeph 1:3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'man 
and beast' stands for the things which belong to love and good deriving from love, 'the birds of the air<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> and the fish of the sea' for those which belong to the understanding and so to truth. These 
are called 'stumbling-blocks' because for wicked people it is goods and truths, not beasts and birds, that are stumbling-blocks. These are also plainly referred to as man's. In David,  </p>
<blockquote>
The trees of 
Jehovah are watered abundantly, and the cedars of Lebanon which He planted. In them flying things build their nests. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20104:16,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 104:16, 17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The trees of Jehovah and the cedars of Lebanon' stands for spiritual 
man, 'flying things' for his rational or natural truths which are like 'nests'. What is more, 'the birds build nests in the branches' was a common saying by which people meant truths, as in Ezekiel, </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
On the mountain height of Israel I will plant it, and it will bring forth a branch, and bear fruit, and it will become a noble cedar, and under it will dwell every flying thing of every 
sort,<A name="fntext5"></a><A href="#fn5"><sup>e</sup></a> in the shade of its branches they will dwell. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2017:23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 17:23</a>. </p>
<p>This stands for the Church among gentiles which was spiritual and which is 'a noble cedar'. 'Birds of every sort'<A name="fntext5"></a><A href="#fn5"><sup>e</sup></a> stands for 
truths of every kind. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
In its branches all the birds of the air<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> made their nests, and under its branches every wild animal of the field gave birth, and in its shadow dwelt 
all great nations. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2031:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 31:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Asshur, which is the spiritual Church and is called 'a cedar'. 'Birds of the air'<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> stands for its truths, 'beasts' for its goods.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In Daniel, </p>
<blockquote>
Its 
branch was fair, and its fruit much, and food for all was on it. The beast of the field had shade under it, and in its branches dwelt the flying things of the air'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%204:12,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 4:12, 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'beast' 
stands for goods, and 'flying thing of the air'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> for truths. This may become clear to anyone, for what else would bird and beast dwelling there really be? The same applies to what the Lord said, The 
kingdom of God is like a grain of mustard seed, which someone took and sowed in his garden, and it grew and became a big tree so that the birds of the air<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> dwelt in its branches. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2013:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 13:19</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:32&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13:32</a>;

Quod per 'avem secundum speciem suam' significetur omne spirituale verum, per 'volucrem' naturale verum, per 'alatum' sensuale verum, constat ab illis quae prius de avibus dicta et ostensa sunt, ut 
n. 40. Antiquissimi assimilarunt cogitata hominis avibus. quia ita se habent respective ad voluntaria: quia hic nominantur avis, et volucris, et alatum, et haec succedunt, sicut in homine intellectualia, 
rationalia et sensualia, ne cui dubium sit quin illa significent, licet adhuc quaedam loca ex Verbo confirmantia adducere, ex quibus etiam patet quod 'bestiae' talia quae dicta sunt, significent; 
 [2] apud Davidem, 	Dominari fecisti Illum super opera manuum Tuarum, omnia posuisti sub pedibus Illius, gregem et armenta omnia, et etiam bestias agrorum, volucrem caelorum, et pisces maris, Ps. viii 
7, 8, [9] [A.V. 6, 7, 8];                                                ubi de Domino, Cujus dominium super hominem, et super quae     sunt hominis, ita describuntur; aliter, quid foret dominium super bestias 
et aves? apud eundem,                                      	Arbor fructus et omnes cedri, fera et omnis bestia, reptile et volucris {1} alae,... glorificabunt nomen Jehovae, Ps. cxlviii 
9, 10, 13; </p>
<p>'arbor fructus' est caelestis homo, 'cedrus' est spiritualis homo, 'fera et bestia et reptile' illorum bona, sicut hic; 'volucris alae' illorum vera, ex quibus glorificare possunt nomen Jehovae; 
nequaquam potest fera, bestia, reptile, volucris; in scriptis profanis talia hyperbolice dici possunt, sed in Verbo Domini nusquam hyperbolica sunt, sed significativa et repraesentativa: [3] apud 
Ezechielem, 	Contremiscent coram Me pisces maris, et avis caelorum, et fera agri, et omne reptile repens super humo, et omnis 	homo, qui super faciebus humi, xxxviii 20; </p>
<p>                        
    quod hic 'bestiae et aves' talia significent, constat manifeste, nam quid gloriae Jehovae si contremiscerent pisces, aves, bestiae, an quisque putare potest quod tales locutiones forent sanctae, 
si non sancta involverent: apud Jeremiam,                                       	Vidi et ecce non homo, omnis avis caelorum aufugit, iv 25;    pro quod omne bonum et verum; hic quoque 'homo' pro bono 
amoris: apud eundem,                                                    	Vastata sunt, ut non sit vir transiens, et non audiunt vocem pecoris; ab ave caelorum et usque ad bestiam, evagati sunt, abiverunt, 
ix 9 [A.V. 10];                                     similiter, pro quod omne verum et bonum abiverit: [4] apud eundem, 	Quousque {2} lugebit terra, et herba omnis agri exarescet? propter malitiam 
habitantium in ea, periit bestiae et avis, quia dixerunt, Non videbit novissimum 	nostrum, xii 4, ubi 'bestiae' pro bonis, et 'avis' pro veris, quae perierunt: apud Zephaniam, 	Consumam hominem 
et bestiam, consumam avem caelorum, et pisces maris, et offendicula cum impiis, et exscindam hominem a faciebus humi, 13; </p>
<p>ubi 'homo et bestia' pro illis quae sunt amoris et inde boni; 'avis caelorum 
et pisces maris' pro illis quae sunt intellectus, ita quae sunt veri, quae vocantur 'offendicula' quia impiis bona et vera sunt offendicula, non bestiae et aves; quod sint illa quae hominis, manifeste 
etiam dicitur: apud Davidem, 	Saturantur arbores Jehovae, et cedri Libani, quas plantavit, ubi volucres nidificant, Ps. civ 16, 17; </p>
<p>'arbores Jehovae, et cedri Libani' pro spirituali homine; 'volucres' 
pro ejus veris rationalibus aut naturalibus, quae sunt quasi 'nidi.' Alioquin communis formula loquendi finit quod 'nidificarent aves in ramis,' qua significabantur vera; [5] ut apud Ezechielem, 	In 
monte altitudinis Israelis plantabo illam, et attollet ramum, et faciet fructum, et erit in cedrum magnificam, et habitabunt sub illa omnis volucris omnis alae, in umbra ramorum ejus habitabunt, 
xvii 23; </p>
<p>pro Ecclesia gentium, quae spiritualis, quae est 'cedrus magnifica,' 'avis omnis alae' pro veris omnis generis: apud eundem, 	In ramis ejus nidificarunt omnis avis caelorum, et sub ramis ejus 
genuerunt omnis fera agri, ac in umbra ejus habitabunt omnes gentes magnae, xxxi 6; </p>
<p>de Asshure, qui est Ecclesia spiritualis, et vocatur 'cedrus,' 'avis caelorum' pro veris ejus, 'bestia' pro bonis: 
[6] apud Danielem, 	Ramus ejus pulcher, et fructus ejus multus, et esca omnibus in ea; sub illa umbram habebat bestia agri, et in ramis ejus "habitabant volucres caeli, iv 9, 18 [A.V. 12, 21]; </p>
<p>ubi 
'bestia' pro bonis, 'volucris caelorum' pro veris; quod unicuivis constare potest, nam quid foret quod ibi habitaret avis et bestia?  Similiter quae Dominus locutus, 	Regnum Dei simile est grano sinapis, 
quod accipiens homo projecit in hortum suum, crevitque, et factum est in 	arborem magnam, ut aves caeli habitarint in ramis ejus, Luc. xiii 19; Matth. xiii 32; Marc. iv 32. 	@1 Sch. has avis 
alae, as also n. 994, but Heb. here is [ ] (tsippor) as in Ps. viii 8 above.$ 	2@ We follow  A.E. 304 and 650 and R.V. in the placing of '?' A.V. and Sch. have it at end of following clause. I has a 
comma in both places, Sch. has consumtae sunt for periit, but Heb. verb is singular. In 7571, however, S. has consumentur.$ </p>
