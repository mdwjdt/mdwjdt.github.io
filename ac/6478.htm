<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6478节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6478.</strong>当一位天使向某人行善时，他也将自己所获得的良善、福分和幸福传给此人；他做这一切是出于将一切毫无保留地给予他人的渴望。当他处于这样一种交流时，良善，连同福分和幸福一起流向他，远比他所给予的多得多；这一切会不断得到越来越多的回报。但是，一旦有这样的想法进入，即他想要交流自己所拥有的，是为了在自己里面获得这种福分和幸福的流注，流注就会消散；如果有从其良善所传予的对象那里得回报的想法进入，更是如此。我通过大量经历得以知道这一点。由此也可以看出，主存在于每一个细节中；因为主具有这样的性质：祂愿意把自己给予所有人，并以这种方式使存在于那些作为祂自己的形像和样式之人中间的福分和幸福增长。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6478</b></p><p><b>6478.</b>
When an angel does good to anyone, he also communicates to him his own good, good fortune, and bliss, and this with the desire to give the other everything, and to retain nothing. When he is in such 
communication, then good flows in unto him together with good fortune and bliss much more than he gives, and this with continual increase. But as soon as the thought occurs that he desires to communicate 
what he has for the sake of obtaining in himself this influx of good fortune and bliss, the influx is dissipated; and still more so if any thought comes in of recompense from him to whom he communicates 
his good. This it has been given me to know from much experience; and from this also it may be seen that the Lord is in every single thing, for the Lord is such that He wills to give Himself to 
all, and hence good fortune and bliss are increased with those who are images and likenesses of Him. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6478</b></p><p><b>6478.</b>
When an angel does good to somebody else he also communicates to that person the goodness, blessedness, and bliss he himself has received; and he does this in a spirit of wishing to give the other everything 
and hold nothing back. When that spirit of communication is present in him, he receives far more goodness flowing in with blessedness and bliss than he imparts; and this goes on unceasingly with 
increasing returns. But as soon as any thought enters in of wishing to communicate what he has to the end that he may gain that influx of blessedness and bliss into himself, the influx is nullified, 
especially if some thought occurs to him of repayment from the one to whom he communicates the goodness he himself has received. This I have been led to know about from a considerable amount of experience. 
From this too it may be seen that the Lord is present in specific details; for the Lord's nature is such that He wishes to give Himself to all, and in that way to increase the blessedness and 
bliss existing with those who are images and likenesses of Himself. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 6478</b>
</p><b>6478.</b>
Cum angelus alicui bonum facit, communicat etiam ei suum bonum, faustum et beatum, et hoc eo animo ut dare velit alteri omne ac nihil retinere; cum in tali communicatione est, tunc influit bonum cum 
fausto et beato ad illum multo plus quam dat, et hoc continue cum augmentis.  Ast ut primum obvenit cogitatio quod {1}communicare velit suum ob finem ut obtineat influxum illum fausti et beati {2}in 
se, dissipatur influxus; et adhuc magis si  aliquid cogitationis incidit de remuneratione ab illo cui bonum suum communicat; hoc a plure experientia scire datum est.  Inde quoque constare potest quod 
Dominus sit in singulis, nam Dominus talis est ut Se dare velit omnibus, inde augetur faustum et beatum apud illos qui imagines ac similitudines Ipsius sunt. @1 communicatio sit$ @2 illico dissipantur haec$ </p>
