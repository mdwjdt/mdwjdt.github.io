<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7452节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7452.</strong>“说，你们去，在这地祭祀你们的神吧”表他们不会反对他们敬拜他们的神，但他们必须在附近的地方如此行。这从“说，你们去”“祭祀”和“在这地”的含义清楚可知：“说，你们去”是指他们不会反对；“祭祀”是指敬拜，如前所述（<a href="7393.htm">7393</a>节）；“在这地”，也就是在埃及地，是指在附近的地方。“在这地”表示在附近的地方，这一点从摩西和法老的回答明显看出来：摩西回答说：这样行本不相宜，因为他们要把埃及人所厌恶的在他们眼前献为祭，他们要走三天的路程进到旷野，祭祀耶和华他们的神；法老则回答说，他们不要走得很远（8:21-23）。因此，“这地”在内义上表示那些沉浸于虚假并进行侵扰的人所在的地方，关于他们的附近，可参看前文（<a href="7090.htm">7090</a>节）。</p>

And said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land. That this signifies that they would not oppose their worshiping their God, but it must be done in their neighborhood, is evident from the signification 
of "he said, Go ye," as being that they would not oppose; from the signification of "sacrificing," as being to worship (of which above, n. 7393); and from the signification of "in the land," that 
is, in the land of Egypt, as being in their neighborhood. That "in the land" denotes in their neighborhood, is plain from the answer of Moses, that it was not meet to do so, for they would sacrifice 
the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, but that they would go a way of three days into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Jehovah their God; and also from the reply of Pharaoh, that they should 
not go very far away (verses 21-23). Thus by "the land" in the internal sense is meant where they are who are in falsities and infest, concerning whose nearness see n. 7090. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7452</b></p><p><b>7452.</b>
'And said, Go, sacrifice to your God in the land' means that they would not stand in the way of their worshipping their God, provided that they did so in a place near them. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'said, Go' as their not standing in the way; from the meaning of 'sacrificing' as worshipping, dealt with above in <a href="7393.htm">7393</a>; and from the meaning of 'in the land' - the land of Egypt - as in a place 
nearby. The meaning of 'in the land' as in a place nearby is evident from verses 21-24, from Moses' reply that it would be ill-advised for them to do so, for they would be sacrificing the abomination 
of the Egyptians before their eyes, but that they should go a three days' journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to Jehovah their God; and also from Pharaoh's reply that they should certainly not 
go far away. Thus 'the land' is used to mean in the internal sense the place where those steeped in falsities and engaging in molestation are, regarding whose nearness, see <a href="7090.htm">7090</a>. </p>

</p><b>7452.</b>
`Et dixit, Ite, sacrificate Deo vestro in terra': quod significet quod non obstarent quin colant Deum suum, sed in propinquitate apud illos, constat ex significatione `dixit, Ite' quod sit quod non 
obstarent; ex significatione `sacrificare' quod sit colere, de qua supra n. 7393; et ex significatione `in terra,' nempe in terra Aegypti, quod sit in propinquitate; quod `in terra' sit in propinquitate, 
patet a responso Moschis quod non consultum esset facere ita, quia abominationem Aegyptiorum sacrificarent ad oculos illorum, sed quod viam trium dierum irent in desertum, et sacrificarent Jehovae 
Deo suo; {1}tum a responso Pharaonis quod elongando non elongarent se ad (x)eundum vers. 21-23[,24]; ita per terram in sensu (m)interno intelligitur ubi illi qui in falsis et infestant, {2}de quorum 
propinquitate {3}, videatur n. 7090.(n) 	@1 sed$ 	@2 quod illi in$ 	@3 i sint$ </p>
