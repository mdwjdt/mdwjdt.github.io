<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7026节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7026.</strong>“摩西手里拿着神的杖”表这些事物来自神性能力。这从“杖”的含义清楚可知，“杖”是指能力（<a href="4013.htm">4013</a>，<a href="4015.htm">4015</a>，<a href="4876.htm">4876</a>，<a href="4936.htm">4936</a>节），因此“神的杖”表示神性能力。从前面（<a href="7011.htm">7011</a>节）可以看出：“杖”表示属世层的能力，“手”表示属灵层的能力，属世层从属灵层获得自己的能力；因此，“杖”在手里时表示能力。“杖”表示能力源于来世的代表，因为在来世，那些行巫术的人看似拿着杖，也是用来给他们提供能力的。这也解释了为何埃及的术士有杖，他们用来行看似神迹的事；古人由此在他们的着作中处处将杖赋予巫师或术士。由此可见，“杖”是代表能力的一个象征，还有一个直接的对应关系，因为杖是实际行使能力所用的工具。但在巫师或术士当中，这是滥用对应关系，除了在他们所在的地狱里之外，完全无效，并且只在这些地狱有效，因为幻觉和诡诈在那里掌权。由于杖与能力之间存在直接的对应关系，故摩西被吩咐把杖拿在手中，用它来行神迹。也由于同样的原因，国王也有权杖，它是一根短棒，为王权的标志。杖与能力的对应关系源于以下事实：杖或棍子支撑手和臂，因而同时支撑身体，而在大人里面，手和臂对应于能力（<a href="878.htm">878</a>，<a href="3387.htm">3387</a>，<a href="4931.htm">4931</a>-<a href="4937.htm">4937</a>，<a href="5327.htm">5327</a>，<a href="5328.htm">5328</a>，<a href="5544.htm">5544</a>，<a href="6947.htm">6947</a>，<a href="7011.htm">7011</a>节）。</p>

And Moses took the rod of God in his hand. That this signifies that these things were from Divine power, is evident from the signification of "rod," as being power (n. 4013, 4015, 4876, 4936) thus "the 
rod of God" denotes Divine power. (That "rod" denotes the power of the natural, and "hand" the power of the spiritual, and that the natural has power from the spiritual, thus that by "rod" is signified 
power when it is in the hand, see n. 7011.) That a "rod" denotes power, originates from the representatives in the other life, for in that life they who practice magical arts appear with rods, which 
also serve them for powers. Hence also the Egyptian magicians had rods, whereby they performed what appeared like miracles; and from this the ancients in their writings everywhere assign rods to magicians. 
From all this it can be seen that a rod is a representative of power, and that it is also a real correspondence, for power is actually exercised by means of rods; but with magicians this is 
an abuse of correspondence, neither is it of avail except within the hells where they are, and it avails there because illusions and phantasies reign there. And because there is a real correspondence 
of a rod with power, Moses was commanded to take a rod in his hand, and by it to do signs; and for the same reason also kings have a scepter, which is a short rod, and by it is signified royal power. 
The correspondence of a rod and of power, is from the fact that a rod or staff supports the hand and arm, thus at the same time the body, and in the Grand Man the hand and arm correspond to power (n. 
878, 3387, 4931-4937, 5327, 5328, 5544, 6947, 7011). </p>

'And Moses took the rod of God in his hand' means that those things were from Divine power. This is clear from the meaning of 'the rod' as power, dealt with in <a href="4013.htm">4013</a>, <a href="4015.htm">4015</a>, <a href="4876.htm">4876</a>, <a href="4936.htm">4936</a>, so that 'the rod 
of God' is Divine power. As may be seen above in <a href="7011.htm">7011</a>,'the rod' means natural power while 'the hand' means spiritual power, and the natural derives its power from the spiritual; and this being so 'the 
rod' means power when it is being held in the hand. The origin of the meaning of 'the rod' as power lies in representatives in the next life, for there those who practise magic are seen with rods which 
also serve to provide them with power. This also explains why the magicians of Egypt had rods which they used in performing what seemed to be miracles, and why everywhere in their writings the ancients 
give magicians rods. From these considerations it may be recognized that 'a rod' is an emblem representing power, and also has a direct correspondence with it since rods are instruments through 
which power is actually exercised. But among magicians this involves a misuse of correspondence and is altogether ineffective except within the hells where they are, and then only within these because 
trickery and false impressions reign. Since there is a direct correspondence between a rod and power, Moses was commanded to take the rod in his hand and use it to do the signs. For the same reason 
kings have a sceptre, which is a short rod and serves as a sign of royal power. The correspondence of rod and power derives from the fact that a rod or staff supports the hand and arm, and so at the same 
time the body, and the hand and arm correspond to power in the Grand Man, see <a href="878.htm">878</a>, <a href="3387.htm">3387</a>, <a href="4931.htm">4931</a>-<a href="4977.htm">4977</a>, <a href="5327.htm">5327</a>, <a href="5328.htm">5328</a>, <a href="5544.htm">5544</a>, <a href="6947.htm">6947</a>, <a href="7011.htm">7011</a>. </p>

`Et accepit Moscheh baculum Dei in manu sua': quod significet quod illa ex potentia Divina, constat ex significatione `baculi' quod sit potentia, de qua n. 4013, 4015, 4876, 4936, ita `baculus Dei' 
est potentia Divina; quod `baculus' sit potentia naturalis et `manus' potentia spiritualis, et quod naturali sit potentia ex spirituali, ita quod per `baculum' significetur potentia cum est in manu, videatur 
supra n. 7011.  Quod `baculus' sit potentia, originem ducit a repraesentativis in altera vita, ibi enim qui magica exercent, cum baculis apparent qui illis quoque inserviunt pro potentiis; inde 
quoque magis Aegyptiis fuerunt baculi per (x)quos fecerunt talia quae apparebant sicut miracula; inde antiqui in suis scriptis ubique assignant {1}magis baculos; ex his constare {2}potest quod `baculus' 
sit repraesentativum potentiae, et quod etiam realis correspondentia sit, nam actualiter potentia per baculos exercetur, sed hoc apud magos est correspondentiae abusus, (m)nec valet quicquam nisi 
intra inferna ubi sunt, et ibi quia elusiones et phantasiae regnant.(n)  {3}Et quia realis correspondentia est baculi cum potentia, idcirco Moschi mandatum est ut baculum acciperet in manu, et per illum 
signa faceret; et idcirco etiam regibus est sceptrum, quod est curtus baculus, et per illud significatur potentia regia.  Correspondentia baculi et potentiae inde est quod baculus sustentet manum 
et brachium, ita simul corpus, et manus et brachium {4}correspondent potentiae in Maximo Homine, videatur n. 878, 3387, 4931-4937, 5327, 5328, 5544, 6947, 7011. 	@1 Before ubique$ 	@2 potuit$ 	@3 At$ 	@4
