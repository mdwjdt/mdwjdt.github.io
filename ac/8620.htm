<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8620节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8620.</strong>“你要将这话写在书上作记念”表作为永恒的纪念。这从“记念”和“写在书上”的含义清楚可知：“记念”是指用来提醒或留在记忆中使人想起的东西（参看<a href="8066.htm">8066</a>，<a href="8067.htm">8067</a>节）；“写在书上”是指作为永恒的纪念。这就是以赛亚书中“写在书上”的含义：<br />现今你去，在他们面前将这话写在版上、记在书上，为今后的时期，直到永永远远。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.8.htm">30:8</a>）<br />由于“写在书上”表示纪念，所以经上说忠信者被“写在生命册上”；因为“神的纪念”表示救赎，“不纪念”或“忘记”表示诅咒。关于生命册（或案卷、册、书卷），我们在这些经文读到：<br />亘古常在者坐着要行审判，案卷都展开了。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.9.htm">7:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.10.htm">10</a>）<br />但以理书：<br />那时，你的百姓凡名录在册上的，必得拯救。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但12.1.htm">12:1</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />愿你在他们的罪上加罪，不容他们抵达你的公义。愿他们从生命册上被涂抹，不得记录在义人之中。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗69.27.htm">69:27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗69.28.htm">28</a>）<br />启示录：<br />凡得胜的，必这样穿白衣，我也必不从生命册上涂抹他的名。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.5.htm">3:5</a>）<br /><br />只有写在羔羊生命册上的才得进入新耶路撒冷。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.27.htm">21:27</a>）<br /><br />我看见案卷展开了，并且另有一卷展开，就是生命册。死了的人都凭着这些案卷所记载的，照他们所行的受审判。他们都照各人所行的受审判。若发现有人没记在生命册上，他就被扔在火湖里。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.12.htm">20:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.15.htm">15</a>；以及<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.8.htm">13:8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.8.htm">17:8</a>）.<br />人若不藉着内义知道生命册是什么，以及何谓死了的人照之受审判的“案卷”，就不可能有其它任何概念，只知道天上有这样的案卷，它们上面记着所有人的行为，对它们的记忆就这样得以保存。然而，当上述经文中的“案卷或册”不是指书籍，而是指对他们所曾做过的一切事的回忆。因为每个人都将对自己一切行为的记忆，也就是他的生命册带到来世（<a href="2474.htm">2474</a>节）。但没有人能照行为审判任何人，唯独主能。因为一切行为都是从最终原因（或目的）发出的，这原因（或目的）就深深隐藏在里面。人照这些原因受审判；除了主之外，没有人知道这些原因；这就是为何审判唯独属于主。这也是启示录中这些话所表示的：<br />我看见坐宝座的右手中有书卷，里外都写着字，用七印封严了。我又看见一位大力的天使大声宣传，有谁配展开那书卷，揭开那七印呢？长老中有一位对我说，看哪，犹大支派中的狮子，大卫的根，他已得胜，能展开那书卷，揭开那七印。他既拿了书卷，他们唱新歌，你配拿书卷，配揭开七印。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启5.1.htm">5:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启5.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启5.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启5.8.htm">8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启5.9.htm">9</a>）<br />由此可见，“写着字的书卷”表示每个人行为的展现。诗篇中所提到的册子具有类似含义：<br />所定的日子都写在你册子上。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗139.16.htm">139:16</a>）</p>

Write this for a memorial in the book. That this signifies for perpetual remembrance, is evident from the signification of "a memorial," as being that it is to be remembered, or that it is to be in the 
memory (see n. 8066, 8067); and from the signification of "writing in the book," as being for perpetual remembrance. This is signified by "writing in a book" in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Come, write thou upon 
a tablet before them, and express it upon a book, that it may be for the time to come, forever even to eternity (Isa. 30:8). As remembrance is signified by "writing in a book," therefore the faithful 
are said to be "written in the book of life;" for by "Divine remembrance" is signified salvation, and by "non-remembrance," or "forgetting," is signified damnation. Concerning the book of life we read 
in these passages: </p>
<p>     The Ancient of days did sit for the judgment, and the books were opened (Dan. 7:9, 10).      At that time thy people shall be rescued, everyone that shall be found written 
in the book (Dan. 12:1).      Give iniquity upon their iniquity; and let them not arrive at Thy righteousness; let them be blotted out of the book of lives, and not be written with the righteous (Ps. 
69:27, 28).      He that overcometh shall be clothed in white garments; and I will not blot his name out of the book of life (Rev. 3:5).      There shall not enter into the New Jerusalem any but those 
who are written in the Lamb's book of life (Rev. 21:27).      I saw that the books were opened; and another book was opened, which is that of life; and the dead were judged according to the things 
that were written in the books, according to their works. They were all judged according to their works. And if anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast out into the lake of fire 
(Rev. 20:12, 13, 15; and also, 13:8; 17:8). He who does not know from the internal sense what the book of life is, and also what the books are out of which the dead are to be judged, cannot have any 
other idea than that in heaven there are such books, and that in them are written the acts of all, whereof the memory is thus preserved. When yet by "books" in the above passages are not meant books, 
but the remembrance of all things that have been done; for everyone carries with him into the other life the memory of all his acts, thus the book of his life (n. 2474). But no one except the Lord alone 
can judge anyone according to his acts; because all acts proceed from final causes, which lie deeply concealed within. Man is judged according to these causes; and no one knows them but the Lord. 
Therefore judgment belongs to Him alone, which is also meant by these words in John: </p>
<p>     I saw upon the right hand of Him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back, sealed with seven 
seals. Thereafter I saw a strong angel crying with a great voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? One of the elders said to me, Behold the lion that is of the tribe 
of Judah, the root of David, hath overcome to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof. And He took the book, and they sang a new song, Worthy art Thou who takest the book, and openest the seals 
thereof (Rev. 5:1, 2, 5, 8, 9). From all this it can be seen that by "a book written" is meant the presence of the acts of everyone. In like manner by the "book" in David: </p>
<p>     On Thy book all the 
days were written that were ordained (Ps. 139:16). </p>

'Write this [for] a memorial in the book' means for everlasting remembrance. This is clear from the meaning of 'a memorial' as that which should serve to remind or bring to remembrance, dealt with in <a href="8066.htm">8066</a>, <a href="8067.htm">8067</a>; and from the meaning of 'writing in the book' as to serve as an everlasting reminder. This is the meaning of 'writing in a book in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Come, write on a tablet among them, and express 
it in a book,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> so that it may be for time to come, forever even to eternity.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2030:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 30:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Since remembrance is meant by 'writing in a book', true believers are therefore said to have been 'written 
in the book of life'; for salvation is meant by God's remembering, and damnation by His not remembering or His forgetting. 'The book of life' is referred to in Daniel as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
The Ancient of 
Days [was seated], the judgement sat down, and the books were opened. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%207:9,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 7:9, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<p>At that time Your people will be rescued, every one who is found written in the book. Dan. 
12:1. </p>
<p>In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Add<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> iniquity onto their iniquity, and do not let them reach Your righteousness. Let them be blotted out of the book of the living,<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a> and not be written with the righteous. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2069:27,%2028&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 69:27, 28</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In John, </p>
<blockquote>
He who conquers will be clad in white garments; I will not blot his name out of the book of life. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%203:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 3:5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
None will enter the new Jerusalem except 
those who have been written in the Lamb's book of life. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2021:26,%2027&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 21:26, 27</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
I saw that the books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the book of life, and the dead 
were judged by the things written in the books, according to their works. They were judged, all of them according to their works. And if anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast 
into the lake of fire. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2020:12-15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 20:12-15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
See in addition <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2013:8;%2017:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 13:8; 17:8</a>.

 Anyone who does not know from the internal sense what 'the book of life' is, and also what is meant by 'the books' whose 
contents are to be used to judge the dead, can have no other idea than this - that such books exist in heaven, and that they contain written down in them everyone's deeds, the memory of which is thus 
preserved. However, by the books mentioned in the places quoted above one should not understand books but the remembrance of all the deeds they had performed. For each person takes with him into the 
next life the memory of all his deeds, that is, the book of his life, <a href="2474.htm">2474</a>. But judging someone according to his deeds can be done by no one except the Lord alone. For all deeds emanate from final 
causes,<A name="fntext5"></a><A href="#fn5"><sup>e</sup></a> which lie inwardly and deeply hidden; and it is according to those causes that a person is judged. These are known to no one except the Lord, which is why judgement belongs to Him alone. 
This is also what the following words in John are used to mean, </p>
<blockquote>
I saw on the right hand<A name="fntext6"></a><A href="#fn6"><sup>f</sup></a> of Him sitting on the throne a book written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals. After that 
I saw a strong angel crying out with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book and to loose its seals? One of the elders said to me, Behold, the Lion which is from the tribe of Judah, the root of 
David, has prevailed to open the book and to loose its seals. And He took the book, and they sang a new song, You are worthy to take the book, and to open its seals. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%205:1-9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 5:1-9</a> 
</blockquote>
<p>From all this it becomes 
clear that 'a book written' is used to mean the presence of someone's deeds. The book referred to in David has a similar  meaning, </p>
<blockquote>
In Your book they all were written, the days that were assigned. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20139:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 139:16</a>.

`Scribe hoc memoriale in libro': quod significet in perpetuam memoriam, constat ex significatione `memorialis' quod sit quod reminiscendum, seu quod in memoriam, de qua n. 8066, 8067, et ex significatione 
`scribere in libro' quod sit ad reminiscendum perpetuo; hoc significatur per `scribere in libro' apud Esaiam, Veni, scribe super tabulam apud illos, et super librum exprime illud, ut sit in diem 
posterum, in perpetuum usque in aeternum, xxx 8: </p>
<p>quia reminiscentia per `scribere in libro' significatur, {1}inde fideles dicuntur in `libro vitae scripti', nam per reminiscentiam Divinam significatur 
salvatio, et per non reminiscentiam seu oblivionem damnatio; de `libro vitae' ita apud Danielem, Antiquus dierum judicium consedit, et libri aperti sunt, vii [9,] 10: </p>
<p>apud eundem, In tempore hoc 
eripietur populus tuus, omnis qui invenietur scriptus in libro, xii 1: </p>
<p>apud Davidem, Da iniquitatem super iniquitatem eorum, et ne perveniant ad justitiam Tuam; deleantur e libro vitarum, et cum 
(x)justis ne scribantur, Ps. lxix 28, 29 [A.V. 27, 28]: </p>
<p>apud Johannem, Qui vicerit, is induetur vestimentis albis; non delebo nomen ejus e libro vitae, Apoc. iii 5: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Non ingredietur in 
Hierosolymam novam, nisi qui scripti in libro vitae Agni, Apoc. xxi 26 [, 27]: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Vidi quod libri aperti sint; et liber alius apertus est, qui est vitae; et judicati sunt mortui juxta ea 
quae scripta sunt in libris secundum opera illorum: judicati sunt omnes secundum opera illorum: et si quis non inventus est in libro vitae scriptus, ejectus est in stagnum ignis, Apoc. xx 12-14 [, 15]; </p>
<p>ac 
praeterea xiii 8, xvii 8. 	5 Qui non ex sensu interno scit quid `liber vitae,' tum quid `libri ex quibus judicandi,' non aliam ideam potest habere quam quod in caelo tales libri sint, et quod in 
illis omnium acta scripta sint quorum sic memoria {2}conservatur; cum tamen {3}per `libros' in dictis locis non libri intelliguntur, sed reminiscentia omnium quae egerant; unusquisque enim in alteram 
vitam secum fert omnium actorum suorum memoriam, ita librum vitae suae, n. 2474; sed judicare {4}quemvis secundum acta ejus, nemo potest quam Dominus solus, nam omnia {5}acta procedunt a causis finalibus, 
quae intus alte latent absconditae; {6} secundum illas causas judicatur homo; {7}illas nemo scit quam Dominus, quapropter Ipsi soli est judicium; quod etiam intelligitur per haec apud Johannem, Vidi 
super dextra sedentis super throno librum scriptum intus et a tergo, obsignatum septem sigillis; deinde vidi angelum fortem clamantem voce magna, Quis est dignus ut aperiat librum, et solvat sigilla 
ejus? unus ex senioribus dixit mihi, Ecce {8}vicit Leo, qui {9} ex tribu Jehudae, radix Davidis, ut aperiat librum et solvat sigilla ejus: et sumpsit librum, et cecinerunt canticum novum, Dignus 
es qui accipias librum, et aperias sigilla ejus, Apoc. v 1-9. Ex his constare potest quod per `librum scriptum' intelligatur praesentia actorum cujusvis: similiter per `librum' apud Davidem, Super
