<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第422节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>422.</strong>这个新教会的情形可从犹太教会看出，因为犹太教会既是内在的，也是外在的；内在教会由属天属灵之物构成，外在教会则由属世之物构成。“拉结”代表内在教会，“利亚”代表外在教会。但由于雅各，更确切地说，他的后裔（在圣言中以“雅各”之名来表示），只渴望外在事物，或仅以外在敬拜，所以利亚在拉结之前被许给雅各。双眼无神的利亚代表犹太教会，拉结代表由外邦人构成的新教会。由于这个原因，在先知书中，“雅各”有两层含义：一是象征处于堕落状态的犹太教会；二是象征由外邦人构成的真正的外在教会。当表示内在教会时，雅各就被称为“以色列”。对于这些问题，蒙主怜悯，容后详述。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]422.</strong> The way things stood in this new church can be seen from the Jewish church. It was composed of an inner church and an outer church. Heavenly and spiritual qualities made up the inner church, and earthly qualities, the outer. The inner church was represented by Rachel and the outer by Leah. Jacob, however, or rather his descendants (who are meant by the name Jacob in the Word), were such that they had no interest in anything but outward acts, that is, external worship. Jacob received Leah before Rachel, and Leah with her weak eyes represented the Jewish church, while Rachel represented a new church among non-Jewish nations. So the mention of Jacob in the prophets can be taken in both ways — one when the corrupt Jewish church is symbolized and the other when the true external church among other nations is symbolized. When the inner church is meant, it is called Israel.{*1} These things, with the Lord's divine mercy, will be dealt with later.{*2} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For passages in the prophets about Jacob and Israel, both favorable and unfavorable, see, for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_422/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_9_8" target=_top>Isaiah 9:8</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_422/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_10_20" target=_top>10:20</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_422/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_27_6" target=_top>27:6</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_422/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_31_7" target=_top>Jeremiah 31:7</a>.

How the case was with this new church may be seen from the Jewish Church, which was both internal and external; the internal church consisting of celestial and spiritual things, and the external church 
of natural things. The internal church was represented by Rachel, and the external by Leah. But as Jacob, or rather his posterity understood by "Jacob" in the Word, were such as to desire only external 
things, or worship in externals, therefore Leah was given to Jacob before Rachel; and by blear-eyed Leah was represented the Jewish Church, and by Rachel a new church of the Gentiles. For this reason 
"Jacob" is taken in both senses in the Prophets, in one denoting the Jewish Church in its perverted state, and in the other the true external church of the Gentiles. When the internal church is signified, 
he is called "Israel;" but of these matters, by the Divine mercy of the Lord, more will be said hereafter. </p>

What this new Church was like becomes clear from the Jewish Church, which was both internal and external. The internal Church consisted of celestial and spiritual things, the external of natural. The 
internal Church was represented by Rachel, the external by Leah. Now because Jacob, that is, descendants of Jacob who are meant in the Word by his name, were such as desired external things only, that 
is, worship exclusively external, Leah was given to Jacob before Rachel. The weak-eyed Leah represented the Jewish Church, and Rachel a new Church consisting of gentiles. This is why in the Prophets 
Jacob takes on either meaning, the first when the corrupt Jewish Church is the subject, the second when it is the true external Church consisting of gentiles. When the subject is the internal Church 
he is called Israel. These points will in the Lord's Divine mercy be explained later on.  </p>

Quomodo se res habet cum nova hac Ecclesia, constare potest ab Ecclesia Judaica; erat ea interna et externa; internam constituebant caelestia et spiritualia, externam naturalia.  Interna repraesentata 
est per Rachelem, externa per Leam; sed quia Jacobus seu posteri ejus per Jacobum in Verbo intellecti tales erant, ut non nisi externa, seu cultum in externis, volebant, data est Leah Jacobo ante Rachelem, 
et per Leam debilem oculis repraesentata Ecclesia Judaica et per Rachelem Ecclesia nova gentium; quare Jacobus in utroque sensu apud Prophetas accipitur, in uno cum significatur Ecclesia Judaica 
perversa, in altero cum Ecclesia gentium vera externa; cum interna, appellatur Israel, de quibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus. </p>
