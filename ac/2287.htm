<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2287节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2287.</strong>“耶和华与亚伯拉罕说完话就走了”表主所在这种直觉状态不再是这样。这从“说”的含义和“亚伯拉罕”的代表清楚可知。“说”在内义上表思考，如前所示（<a href="2271.htm">2271</a>节）；不过，在此表发觉，因为经上论到耶和华说，祂“与亚伯拉罕说完话”。思维来自直觉，如前所述；而直觉则来自主的内在，这内在就是耶和华。但在本章，“亚伯拉罕”代表处于人性状态的主，如前面经常说的。由此可见，“耶和华与亚伯拉罕说完话就走了”这句话在内义上无非表示主所在的这种直觉状态结束和完成了。本章大量论述主的直觉和思维的原因可参看前文（<a href="2249.htm">2249</a>节）。</p>

Jehovah went when He had completed His speaking unto Abraham. That this signifies that this state of perception in which the Lord was, then ceased to be such, is evident from the signification of "speaking," 
and from the representation of Abraham. "To speak," in the internal sense, signifies to think (as shown above, n. 2271); but here it signifies to perceive, because it is declared of Jehovah that 
He "had completed His speaking" to Abraham; for the thought was from perception, as before said, and the perception was from the Lord's internal, which was Jehovah. But "Abraham" in this chapter represents 
the Lord in the human state, as often stated above. From this we can see that by its being said that "Jehovah went when He had completed His speaking unto Abraham," nothing else is signified 
in the internal sense than that the state of perception in which the Lord had been, then came to its close and completion. The reason why the Lord's perception and thought are so much treated of in this 
chapter in the internal sense, may be seen above (n. 2249). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2287</b></p><p><b>2287.</b>
That 'Jehovah departed, when He had finished speaking to Abraham' means that this state of perception which existed with the Lord now ceased to be such is clear from the meaning of 'speaking' and from 
the representation of 'Abraham'. In the internal sense 'speaking' means thinking, as shown above in <a href="2271.htm">2271</a>. Here however it means perceiving because it is said of Jehovah that 'He finished speaking to 
Abraham'; for thought flowed from the perception, as stated already, and the perception from the Lord's internal, which was Jehovah. 'Abraham' however in this chapter represents the Lord when the human 
state existed with Him, as stated often above. From this it becomes clear that the words 'Jehovah departed, when He had finished speaking to Abraham' mean nothing else in the internal sense than that 
this state of perception which existed with the Lord now ceased to be. For the reason why in this chapter in the internal sense the Lord's perception and thought are dealt with so much, see above in <a href="2249.htm">2249</a>. </p>

</p><b>2287.</b>
Quod `ivit Jehovah, quando absolvit loqui ad Abrahamum significet quod hic status perceptionis in quo fuit Dominus, tunc absolverit talis esse, constat ex significatione `loqui' et ex repraesentatione 
`Abrahami'; `loqui' in sensu interno significat cogitare, ut ostensum supra n. (x)2271, hic autem percipere quia praedicatur de Jehovah quod `absolverit loqui ad Abrahamum'; cogitatio enim fuit ex 
perceptione, ut prius dictum, et perceptio ex Interno Domini quod fuit Jehovah: `Abrahamus' autem repraesentat in hoc capite Dominum in statu humano, ut saepius supra dictum, inde constare potest [quod] 
per quod `ivit Jehovah, quando absolvit loqui ad Abrahamum' nihil aliud in sensu interno significetur quam quod ille status perceptionis in quo fuit Dominus, tunc absolverit esse.  (m)Causa cur in 
hoc capite tam multum in sensu interno agatur de perceptione et cogitatione Domini, videatur supra n. 2249.(n) </p>
