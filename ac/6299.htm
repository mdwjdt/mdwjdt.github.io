<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6299节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6299.</strong>“说，以色列要指着你祝福说，愿神使你如以法莲、玛拿西一样”表好叫他自己的属灵层能居于理解力的真理和意愿的良善中。这从“以色列”、“以法莲”和“玛拿西”的含义清楚可知：“以色列”是指属灵良善（参看<a href="5801.htm">5801</a>，<a href="5803.htm">5803</a>，<a href="5806.htm">5806</a>，<a href="5812.htm">5812</a>，<a href="5817.htm">5817</a>，<a href="5819.htm">5819</a>，<a href="5826.htm">5826</a>，<a href="5833.htm">5833</a>节）；“以法莲”是指理解力的真理，“玛拿西”是指意愿的良善，如前所述。这些话，即“以色列要指着你祝福，愿神使你”表示好叫属灵层，就是“以色列”能居于它们里面，<br />至于“以色列”所代表的属灵层能居于理解力的真理和意愿的良善，就是“以法莲和玛拿西”中，情况是这样：“以色列”所代表的属灵良善是内在教会的属灵部分；而“以法莲和玛拿西”所代表的真理与良善是外在教会的部分（参看<a href="6296.htm">6296</a>节）。内在之物要成为教会的内在部分，就必须居于教会的外在部分中，因为外在是内在必须立于其上的基础，是内在所必须流入的容器。正因如此，属世层，就是外在，必须重生；否则，内在没有基础或容器；它若没有基础或容器，必彻底灭亡。这就是他自己的属灵层能居于理解力的真理和意愿的良善中所表示的。<br />举例说明这个问题。仁爱所激发的实际情感，也就是说，当一个人向邻舍行善，却不思想任何回报时，他所感受到的平静和幸福的感觉就是教会的内在。但意愿这良善，并出于真理，也就是因为圣言是如此规定的而实行该良善，就是教会的外在。如果属世层或外在不一致，也就是说，不去意愿或实行这良善，因为它在其中看不到任何回报，因而看不到自己的任何东西（事实上，这种自私自利的性情通过遗传和他自己的行为就居于属世人或外在人里面），那么内在就没有基础，或对应于它的容器。相反，它只有要么弃绝、要么败坏、要么抑制其流注之物；内在因此而灭亡。也就是说，它被封闭并堵塞，以致来自天堂的东西无法通过内在进入属世层；只有些许一般性质的光透过周围的缝隙流进来，以使此人能思考、意愿和说话。但这种能力照着属世层中的东西行事，因而赞成反对良善与真理的邪恶与虚假；为了这个目的，它使透过周围的缝隙流入的一般性质的属灵之光服从它自己。</p>

Saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God set thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh. That this signifies that his own spiritual may be in the truth of the intellectual and the good of the will, is evident 
from the representation of Israel, as being spiritual good (see n. 5801, 5803, 5806, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826, 5833); and from the representation of Ephraim, as being the truth of the intellectual, 
and of Manasseh, as being the good of the will (of which above). That the spiritual, which is "Israel," may be in them, is signified by the words, "in thee shall Israel bless, and God set thee." [2] 
As regards the spiritual represented by Israel being in the truth of the intellectual and the good of the will, which are "Ephraim and Manasseh," the case is this. The spiritual good which is represented 
by Israel is the spiritual of the internal church; whereas the truth and good represented by Ephraim and Manasseh are of the external church (see n. 6296). In order for an internal to be an internal 
of the church, it must needs be in the external of the church, for the external holds the place of the foundation on which the internal stands, and is the receptacle into which the internal flows. 
Hence it is that the natural, which is external, must needs be regenerated; for unless it is regenerated, the internal has neither foundation nor receptacle; and if it has no foundation nor receptacle, 
it utterly perishes. This then is what is meant by his own spiritual being in the truth of the intellectual and the good of the will. [3] As an illustration of this matter take this example. The 
very affection of charity which a man feels within himself as a quietude and bliss in benefiting the neighbor without regard to any recompense, is the internal of the church; but to will this good and 
to do it from truth, that is, because it has been so commanded in the Word, is the external of the church. If the natural, which is the external, is not in agreement, that is, does not will nor do this 
good, because it sees in it no recompense, thus nothing of self (for in the natural or external man there is such a disposition both from what is hereditary and from what is actual), then the internal 
has no foundation, nor corresponding receptacle, except such as either rejects, or perverts, or extinguishes the influx; and therefore the internal perishes, that is, is closed and stopped up, so 
that nothing from heaven can pass into the natural through the internal, except some light of a general nature that passes through the chinks everywhere round about, in order that there may be a faculty 
of thinking, of willing, and of speaking, but according to that which is in the natural, thus in favor of evil and falsity against good and truth, to which purpose it makes subservient that amount 
of spiritual light which in a general manner flows in through the chinks everywhere round about. </p>

'Saying, In you will Israel bless, saying, May God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh' means so that its own spiritual may reside in the truth of the understanding and the good of the will. This is 
clear from the representation of 'Israel' as spiritual good, dealt with in <a href="5801.htm">5801</a>, <a href="5803.htm">5803</a>, <a href="5806.htm">5806</a>, <a href="5812.htm">5812</a>, <a href="5817.htm">5817</a>, <a href="5819.htm">5819</a>, <a href="5826.htm">5826</a>, <a href="5873.htm">5873</a>; and from the representation of 'Ephraim' as truth belonging to the understanding, 
and of 'Manasseh' as good belonging to the will, both dealt with above. So that the spiritual, which is 'Israel', may reside in them is what the words 'In you will he bless' and 'May God make you' 
mean. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 What this really means - that the spiritual, represented by 'Israel', may exist within the truth of the understanding and the good of the will, which are 'Ephraim and Manasseh' - is that 
the spiritual good represented by 'Israel' is the spiritual part of the internal Church, whereas the truth and good represented by 'Ephraim and Manasseh' are part of the external Church, see above in <a href="6296.htm">6296</a>. So that what is internal may be the internal part of the Church it must of necessity reside in the external part of it, for the external serves as the foundation on which the internal must stand 
and is the receptacle into which the internal must flow. For this reason the natural, which is the external, must of necessity be regenerated, for if it is not, the internal has no foundation or receptacle; 
and if it has no foundation or receptacle it is completely destroyed. This then is what is meant by 'its own spiritual may reside in the truth of the understanding and the good of the will'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
Let the following example serve to shed light on this particular matter. The actual affection that charity arouses, that is to say, the calm and blissful feeling a person enjoys when he does good 
to his neighbour without thought of any reward, is the internal aspect of the Church. But willing it and doing it out of concern for truth, that is, because the Word prescribes it, are the external 
aspect of the Church. If the natural or the external is not in accord, that is, does not will or perform that action because it sees no reward and so nothing for itself in it - for such self-interest 
resides in the natural or external man through heredity and his own actions - the internal has no foundation or receptacle in harmony with it. Instead it has that which either turns aside, perverts, 
or smothers its inflow, and for that reason the internal is destroyed. That is to say, it is closed and blocked off, so that nothing from heaven can come through by way of the internal into the natural, 
apart from some ordinary degree of light through chinks all around which enables the person to think, will, and speak. But that ability acts in accord with what is in the natural, thus in favour of 
what is evil and false opposing what is good and true, to which end it makes that ordinary degree of spiritual light flowing in through the chinks all around subservient to itself. </p>

`Dicendo, In te benedicet Israel, dicendo, Ponat te Deus sicut Ephraimum et sicut Menashen':  quod significet ut spirituale suum sit in vero intellectualis et bono voluntarii, constat ex repraesentatione 
`Israelis' quod sit bonum spirituale, de qua n. 5801, 5803, 5806, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826, 5833; et ex repraesentatione `Ephraimi' quod sit verum intellectualis, ac `Menashis' quod sit bonum voluntarii, 
de {1}quibus supra; ut spirituale quod `Israel', sit in illis, significatur per verba `in te benedicet, et ponat te Deus'.  [2] Cum hoc quod spirituale per `Israelem' repraesentatum, sit in vero 
intellectualis et bono voluntarii quae sunt `Ephraim et Menasheh', ita se habet:  bonum spirituale quod repraesentatur per `Israelem', est spirituale Ecclesiae internae:  at verum et bonum quae per 
`Ephraimum et Menashen' repraesentantur, sunt Ecclesiae externae, videatur supra n. 6296; ut internum sit internum Ecclesiae, necessario {2} erit in externo ejus, nam externum est fundamenti loco cui 
internum insistet, et est receptaculum in quod internum influet; inde est quod naturale quod est externum, necessario regenerandum sit, nam nisi id regeneratur, internum non habet fundamentum nec receptaculum; 
et si non habet fundamentum nec receptaculum, prorsus perit; id nunc est quod intelligitur per quod spirituale suum sit in vero intellectualis et bono voluntarii.  Sit pro illustratione hujus 
rei hoc exemplum:  [3] ipsa affectio charitatis, nempe quod homo sentiat in se quietum ac beatum in benefaciendo proximo absque respectu ullius remunerationis, est internum Ecclesiae; id autem velle 
et id agere ex vero, hoc est, quia ita in Verbo mandatum est, externum Ecclesiae est; si naturale quod est externum, non concordat, hoc est, {3}nec id vult nec agit, quia in eo nihil remunerationis, 
ita nihil sui, videt, nam in naturali seu externo homine ex hereditario et ex actuali tale inest, tunc internum non habet fundamentum nec receptaculum correspondens, sed tale quod influxum aut rejicit 
aut pervertit aut exstinguit, quapropter internum perit, nempe clauditur et obturatur ut nihil ex caelo in {4}naturale per internum transpiret praeter aliquid lucis in communi per rimas ubivis circumcirca, 
ut facultas sit cogitandi, volendi loquendique, sed secundum id quod in naturali est, ita pro malo et falso contra bonum et verum, ad quod sibi inservire facit id lucis spiritualis quod in communi 
per rimas ubivis circumcirca influit. @1 qua$ @2 i id$ @3 non$ @4 id$ </p>
