<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8367节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8367.</strong>“他们到了以琳”表一种启示和情感的状态，因而一种试探过后的安慰状态。这从“以琳”的含义清楚可知。和以色列人所到过的其它所有地方一样，“以琳”体现并表示所论述的事物的状态和本质（参看<a href="2643.htm">2643</a>，<a href="3422.htm">3422</a>，<a href="4298.htm">4298</a>，<a href="4442.htm">4442</a>节）；在此则“以琳”表示试探过后的状态，即一种启示和情感，因而安慰的状态。因为一切属灵试探过后都启示和情感，因而愉悦和快乐到来；愉悦是由于通过真理而来的启示，快乐是由于对良善的情感。 <br />安慰随试探而来（参看<a href="4572.htm">4572</a>，<a href="5246.htm">5246</a>，<a href="5628.htm">5628</a>，<a href="6829.htm">6829</a>节）；原因在于，通过试探，真理和良善被植入并联结起来；结果，就其灵而言，此人从内在被引入天堂和他以前就已经与之相关的天堂社群。一旦试探结束，以前部分关闭的与天堂的联系就会打开。启示和情感，以及随之的愉悦和快乐由此产生；因为那时，与他相联的天使通过真理并通过良善进入。“十二股水泉”表示通过真理而来的启示和由此产生的愉悦，因为“泉”表示真理；“七十棵棕树”表示由良善所产生的对真理的情感和这情感所带来的快乐，如下文所述。</p>

And they came to Elim. That this signifies a state of enlightenment and of affection, thus of consolation after temptation, is evident from the signification of "Elim," as involving and signifying the 
state and the quality of the thing that is treated of; like all the other places to which the sons of Israel came (see n. 2643, 3422, 4298, 4442); here the state after temptation, namely, a state of 
enlightenment and of affection, thus of consolation. For after all spiritual temptation there come enlightenment and affection, thus pleasantness and delight; pleasantness from enlightenment through 
truth, and delight from the affection of good. [2] That consolation follows after temptations, see n. 4572, 5246, 5628, 6829; the reason is that by means of temptations truths and goods are implanted 
and are conjoined, consequently the man as to his spirit is introduced interiorly into heaven, and to the heavenly societies with which he had previously been associated. When the temptation is ended, 
communication with heaven is opened, which had previously been partly closed, consequently enlightenment and affection, and consequently pleasantness and delight; for then the angels with whom communication 
is given, flow in by means of truth, and by means of good. Enlightenment by means of truth, and the consequent pleasantness, are signified by the "twelve springs of waters," for "springs" signify 
truths; the affection of truth from good, and the consequent delight, are signified by the "seventy palm-trees" (of which below). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8367</b></p><p><b>8367.</b>
'And they came to Elim' means a state of enlightenment and affection, and so a state of comfort after temptation. This is clear from the meaning of 'Elim'; as with all the other places to which the children 
of Israel came, it embodies and has as its meaning the state and essential nature of the reality to which it refers, see <a href="2643.htm">2643</a>, <a href="3422.htm">3422</a>, <a href="4298.htm">4298</a>, <a href="4442.htm">4442</a>. In this instance a state after temptation is meant, 
which is a state of enlightenment and affection, and so of comfort. Every spiritual temptation is followed by enlightenment and affection, and so by feelings of pleasure and delight, pleasure as 
a result of enlightenment through truth, delight as a result of affection for good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 For the fact that comfort follows temptations, see <a href="4572.htm">4572</a>, <a href="5246.htm">5246</a>, <a href="5628.htm">5628</a>, <a href="6829.htm">6829</a>; and the reason why is that through 
temptations truths and forms of good are instilled and linked together, as a result of which inwardly, as to his spirit, a person is brought into heaven and to heavenly communities among which he has 
not been before. Once a temptation is completed, contact with heaven, contact which previously was partially shut off, is opened up. Enlightenment and affection, and consequently pleasure and delight, 
result from this, because the angels with whom he is now in contact enter in by means of truth and by means of good. The enlightenment through truth and the pleasure this gives are meant by 'twelve 
springs of water', since truths are meant by 'springs'; and an affection for truth arising from good and the delight this affords are meant by 'seventy palm trees', spoken of in what comes next. </p>

`Et venerunt ad Elim': quod significet statum illustrationis et affectionis, ita consolationis post tentationem, constat ex significatione `Elim' {1}quod involvat et significet statum et quale rei, 
de qua agitur, sicut omnia alia loca ad quae venerunt filii Israelis, videatur n. 2643, 3422, 4298, 4442; (x)hic statum post tentationem, nempe statum illustrationis et affectionis, ita consolationis; 
nam post omnem tentationem spiritualem venit illustratio et affectio, ita amoenum et jucundum, amoenum ex illustratione per verum, et jucundum ex affectione boni; quod succedat consolatio post {2}tentationes, 
videatur n. 4572, 5246, 5628, 6829; causa est quia per tentationes implantantur 2 vera et bona, et conjunguntur; inde homo (x)quoad spiritum suum interius in caelum {3} introducitur, adque societates 
caelestes cum quibus non prius fuerat; {4} cum tentatio finita est, {5}aperitur communicatio cum caelo, quae prius quoad partem clausa fuit; inde illustratio et affectio, proinde amoenum et 
jucundum, nam angeli tunc, cum quibus {6}datur communicatio, influunt per verum (c)et per bonum.  Illustratio per verum et inde amoenum significatur per `duodecim fontes aquarum,' nam `fontes' significant 
vera; affectio veri ex bono et inde jucundum significatur per `septuaginta palmas,' de quibus sequitur. 	@1 quod sicut alia loca, quo venerunt filii Israelis, involvant statum et quale rei, de qua 
ibi agitur, de qua$ 	@2 tentationem$ 	@3 i a Domino$ 	@4 i inde$ 	@5 After fuit$ 	@6 aperta est$ </p>
