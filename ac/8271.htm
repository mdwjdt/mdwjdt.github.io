<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8271节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8271.</strong>“我要尊崇祂”表现在神性敬拜也要献给祂。这从“尊崇”的含义清楚可知，当论及人，说他“尊崇耶和华”时，“尊崇”是指敬拜；因为神性敬拜在于对比自己尊崇主，人照着在主面前自我谦卑的程度而如此行。谦卑是神性敬拜的本质要素。当这种本质要素存在于一个人里面时，祂就处于从主接受信之真理和仁之良善的正确状态，并因此处于敬拜祂的正确状态。不过，人若在主面前自高自大，就会关闭其心智的内层，不去领受来自主的良善和真理。至于当经上论到主说，“祂高举自己”时，“高举自己”表示什么，可参看前文（<a href="8264.htm">8264</a>节）。</p>

And I will exalt Him. That this signifies that now also He has Divine worship, is evident from the signification of "to exalt," when it is said of man that he "will exalt Jehovah," as being worship; 
for Divine worship consists in the exaltation of the Lord relatively to oneself, which is done according to the degree of the self-humiliation before the Lord. Humiliation is the essential of Divine worship. 
When man is in this essential he is hence in a state of receiving from the Lord the truth which is of faith and the good which is of charity, consequently in a state of worshiping Him. But if 
man exalts himself before the Lord, he hence closes the interiors of his mind for the reception of good and truth from the Lord. (What is meant by "exalting oneself," when it is said of the Lord that 
He "exalts Himself," see above, n. 8264.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8271</b></p><p><b>8271.</b>
'And I will exalt Him' means that now also will Divine worship be offered to Him. This is clear from the meaning of 'exalting' - when it is said that a person will exalt Jehovah - as worship; for Divine 
worship consists in exalting the Lord in contrast to self, which one does according to one's degree of self-abasement before the Lord. Self-abasement is the essential element in Divine worship. When 
that element is present in a person he is in the right state to receive from the Lord the truth of faith and the good of charity, and is consequently in the right state to offer Him worship. But if 
a person exalts himself before the Lord he shuts the interiors of his mind off from receiving goodness and truth from the Lord. For what is meant by self-exaltation when it says of the Lord that He exalts 
Himself, see above in <a href="8264.htm">8264</a>. </p>

`Et exaltabo Ipsum': quod significet quod etiam nunc Ipsi cultus Divinus, constat ex significatione `exaltare,' cum dicitur de homine quod exaltabit Jehovam, quod sit cultus, nam cultus Divinus consistit 
in exaltatione Domini respective ad se, {1}quod fit secundum gradum humiliationis sui coram Domino; humiliatio est essentiale cultus Divini; cum homo in hoc essentiali est, tunc {2}est in statu 
recipiendi a Domino verum quod fidei et bonum quod charitatis, consequenter in statu colendi Ipsum; {3}si autem homo exaltat se coram Domino, tunc claudit interiora mentis suae pro receptione boni et 
veri a Domino.  (d)Quid `exaltare se,' cum dicitur de Domino quod Ipse (t)te exaltet, videatur supra n. 8964. 	@1 et in humiliatione sui respective ad Dominum$ 	@2 After statu$ 	@3 at si homo se exaltat$ </p>
