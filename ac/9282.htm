<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9282节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9282.</strong>“凡我对你们说的话，你们要谨守”表他们要执行诫命、典章和律例。这从“凡耶和华对他们说的话”和“谨守”的含义清楚可知：“凡耶和华对他们说的话”是指生活的一切律法，敬拜的律法和国民（civic state）的律法，因为生活的律法被称为“诫命”，敬拜的律法被称为“律例”，民间的律法被称为“典章”（参看<a href="8972.htm">8972</a>节）；“谨守”或遵守是指执行，因为执行它们就是在遵守它们。由于生活的律法，敬拜的律法，国民的律法只要仅仅在他的理解力中，在他那里就什么也不是，只有存在于他的意愿中时，才是某种东西，故圣言处处说到，必须“遵行”它们；因为遵行它们属于意愿；而知道、理解、承认并相信属于理解力。然而，它们在变成此人意愿的一部分之前，不会与他同在；在成为植根于意愿的理解力的一部分之前，也不会在他身上显现。因为人的存在就在于意愿，显现则在于由此而来的承认和相信。在一个人那里没有这种存在和显现的事物不会变成他自己的，而是站在外面，还没有被领进屋里。因此，它们根本无助于这个人的永生；因为这类事物若不成为生活的一部分，在来世就被驱散；只有那些在他心里，也就是在他的意愿里，并由此在他的理解力中的事物才会保留下来。正因如此，经上在圣言中处处说到，必须“遵行”诫命和律例，如在摩西五经：<br />你们要遵行我的典章，谨守我的律例，按此而行。所以你们要谨守我的律例、我的典章。人若遵行，就必因此活着。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利18.4.htm">18:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利18.5.htm">5</a>）<br />在其它经文也提到（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.20.htm">5:20</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.24.htm">7:24</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.27.htm">27</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.27.htm">16:27</a>；约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.21.htm">3:21</a>）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9282</b></p><p><b>9282.</b>
And all that I have said unto you ye shall keep. That this signifies that the commandments, the judgments, and the statutes are to be done is evident from the signification of "all that Jehovah had said 
unto them," as being all things of the life, of worship, and of the civil state; for the things of life were called "commandments," those of worship were called "statutes," and those of the civil 
state were called "judgments" (see n. 8972); and from the signification of "keeping" or observing, as being to do, for by doing them they are observed. As the laws of life, of worship, and of the civil 
state, are not anything with a man so long as they are in his understanding only, but become something with him when they are in the will, therefore it is said in the Word throughout that they must 
be "done;" for doing is of the will; but knowing, understanding, acknowledging, and believing are of the understanding. These latter, however, have no being with man until they become of the will, nor 
do they come forth with him until they become of the understanding from the will; for the being of man is to will, and the coming forth is to acknowledge and believe therefrom. The things which have 
no such being and coming forth with a man are not appropriated to him, but stand without, and are not as yet received into the house; and therefore they do not contribute anything to the eternal life 
of the man; for unless such things have been made of the life, they are dissipated in the other life; those only remaining which are of the heart, that is, of the will and from this of the understanding. 
This being so, it is said in the Word throughout that the commandments and the statutes must be "done;" as in Moses: </p>
<p>     Ye shall do My judgments, and keep My statutes, to walk therein. Ye shall 
therefore keep My statutes, and My judgments; which if a man do, he shall live by them (Lev. 18:4-5; also Matt. 5:20; 7:24-27; 16:27; John 3:21); </p>
<p>and in many other passages. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9282</b></p><p><b>9282.</b>
'And all that I have said to you you shall keep' means that they should carry out the commandments, judgements, and statutes. This is clear from the meaning of 'all that Jehovah said to them' as all 
laws of life, laws of worship, and laws of the civic state (laws of life are called 'commandments', those of worship are called 'statutes', and those of the civic state are called 'judgements', <a href="8972.htm">8972</a>); 
and from the meaning of 'keeping' or observing as carrying out, for when anyone carries them out they are observed. Since those laws of life, laws of worship, and laws of the civic state are not anything 
with a person as long as they are confined to his understanding, and are only something with him when they are present in his will, it is stated everywhere in the Word that they must be carried out, 
for carrying them out belongs to the will. But knowing, understanding, acknowledging, and believing belong to the understanding; yet they do not have any being with the person until they become part 
of his will, and there is no manifestation of them with him until they become part of an understanding rooted in the will. For having being consists in willing, and manifestation in acknowledging and 
believing as a result of willing. Things that have no such being or manifestation with a person are not properly his own. They stand outside, not as yet received into the house. So they make no contribution 
at all towards the person's eternal life. For such things if they have not become part of his life are dispelled in the next life; the only things to remain will be those which are in his heart, 
that is, in his will and from there in his understanding. This being so, it is stated everywhere in the Word that commandments and statutes must be carried out, as in Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
You shall carry out 
My judgements and keep My statutes, to go in them. Therefore you shall keep My statutes and My judgements, which if a person carries them out, he will live by them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2018:4,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 18:4, 5</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>It is also stated 
in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%205:19;%207:24-27;%2016:27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 5:19; 7:24-27; 16:27</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3:21</a>; and very many times elsewhere.  </p>

`Et omne quod dixi ad vos custodietis': quod significet quod praecepta, judicia, et statuta facienda sint, constat ex significatione `omne quod Jehovah dixit ad eos' quod sint omnia quae vitae, quae 
cultus, et quae status civilis {1}; quae vitae vocabantur praecepta, quae cultus statuta, et quae status civilis judicia {2}, n. 8972; et ex significatione `custodire' seu {3} observare, quod sit facere, 
nam per facere observantur.  Quia illa quae vitae, quae cultus, et quae status civilis, {4} non sunt aliquid apud hominem quamdiu in solo ejus intellectu sunt, sed tunc apud illum sunt quando in voluntate, 
ideo in Verbo dicitur ubivis quod facienda, nam facere est voluntatis; sed scire, intelligere, agnoscere, et credere sunt intellectus, at {5} haec non sunt apud hominem priusquam fiunt voluntatis 
{6}, nec existunt apud illum priusquam fiunt intellectus ex voluntate, nam esse hominis est velle, et existere est inde agnoscere et credere; quae non ita sunt et existunt apud hominem non ei appropriata 
sunt; stant {7} foris nondum in domum recepta; ita nec faciunt aliquid ad vitam aeternam hominis, nam talia si non facta sunt vitae {8}, dissipantur in altera vita, remanentibus solum quae cordis 
sunt, hoc est, quae voluntatis et inde intellectus; quia ita est, in Verbo ubivis dicitur quod praecepta et statuta facienda sint, ut apud Moschen, 	Judicia Mea facietis, et statuta Mea custodietis 
ad (x)eundum in illis; quare costodietis statuta Mea et judicia Mea, quae si fecerit homo, vivet per ea, Lev. xviii (x)4, 5; </p>
<p>(o)tum Matth. v (x)19, vii 24-27, xvi 27; Joh. iii 21; et perpluries
