<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10751节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>星空中的第五个星球-续<br /><strong>10751</strong>.后来，我被恩准与这些灵人谈论他们自己的星球，因为当属世记忆或外在记忆被主打开时，所有灵人都知道这一点；他们把这种记忆从世上带来了，只是不能打开，除非有主的美意。至于他们所来自的星球，这些灵人说，当被准许时，他们就向其星球的居民显现，如同世人那样与他们交谈，这一切是通过他们被带入属世记忆或外在记忆，因而被带入他们活在世上时所持有的想法而实现的；同时，居民的内在视觉，也就是他们灵的视觉被打开了，灵人以这种方式向他们显现。他们补充说，居民并不知道他们不是其星球上的世人，只是当灵人忽然从他们眼前消失时，才发觉情况不是这样。我告诉他们说，在古代，这种事在我们地球上也发生过，如发生在亚伯拉罕、撒拉、罗得、所多玛的居民、玛挪亚和他妻子、约书亚、马利亚、以利沙伯和众先知身上；主也以同样的方式显现，在祂揭示自己之前，那些看见祂的人只知道祂是地球上的一个人；但如今这种情况很少发生，以免这种事迫使人们去相信；因为强制性的信仰，如通过奇迹进入的那种，不会固着在此人身上，对那些信仰能在一种非强制的状态下通过圣言被植入的人来说，也可能是一种伤害。</p>

A CONTINUATION ABOUT THE FIFTH EARTH IN THE STARRY HEAVEN. It was afterward granted me to speak with these spirits about their own earth, for all spirits know about this when their natural or external 
memory is opened by the Lord, because they bring this memory with them from the world; but it is not opened except with the Lord's good pleasure. With regard to the earth from which they were, the spirits 
then said that when leave is granted they appear to the inhabitants of their earth and speak with them as men, and that this is effected by their being let into their natural or external memory, 
and consequently into thought such as they had when they lived in the world; and that at the same time the interior sight of the inhabitants, that is, the sight of their spirit, is opened, and in this 
way the spirits appear to them. They added that the inhabitants know not but that they are men of their earth, and only notice that this is not the case when the spirits are suddenly taken away from 
their eyes. I told them that in ancient times it was the same on our earth, as with Abraham, Sarah, Lot, the inhabitants of Sodom, Manoah and his wife, Joshua, Mary, Elizabeth, and the prophets in general; 
and that the Lord appeared in the same way, and that until He revealed Himself those who saw Him knew not but that He was a man of the earth; but that now this rarely happens, lest such things 
should compel men to believe; for a compulsory faith, such as enters by means of miracles, does not cleave to the man, and also might be an injury to those with whom faith could be implanted through 
the Word in a state that is not compulsory. </p>

THE FIFTH PLANET OUT IN SPACE - continued  </p>
<p>Afterwards I was allowed to talk to those spirits about their planet. For all spirits know how to talk, when their natural or external memory is opened 
by the Lord; they bring that memory with them from the world, but it is opened only at the Lord's discretion. The ones to whom I was talking said of the planet to which they belonged that when permitted 
to do so they appear as people to inhabitants of their planet and talk to them. The way this is done is by their being taken back to their natural or external memory and consequently to the thought-level 
that had been theirs when they lived in the world; and at the same time the inhabitants have their interior sight or the sight of their spirit opened for them. This is how the spirits appear to 
the inhabitants. They added that those inhabitants are unaware of them as anything other than people living on that planet, and that the inhabitants first realize that they are not ordinary people when 
they are withdrawn suddenly from their sight. I told them that people in ancient times on our own planet, such as Abraham, Sarah, Lot, the inhabitants of Sodom, Manoah and his wife, Joshua, Mary, 
Zechariah<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>, and the prophets in general had had the same experience. I said that the Lord had appeared in the same way, and that those who saw Him were unaware of His being anyone other than a person 
living on our planet, until He revealed who He really was. But at the present day, I said, people are rarely given this experience, for fear that such things will compel them to believe; for belief instilled 
under compulsion, such as that which miracles induce, is short-lived. Furthermore that kind of experience would do harm to those who are capable of having belief implanted in them by means of 
the Word, in a state in which there is no such compulsion.

Continuatio de Quinta Tellure in Caelo Astrifero </p>
<p>Postea loqui {1}datum est spiritibus illis de sua tellure; nam hoc sciunt omnes spiritus, quando memoria eorum naturalis seu externa aperitur a Domino, 
hanc enim secum habent e mundo, sed {2} non aperitur nisi ex beneplacito Domini; {3} dicebant tunc spiritus de tellure sua e qua erant, quod, cum illis venia datur, appareant incolis (t)telluris 
suae, ac loquantur cum illis sicut homines; et quod id fiat per id quod mittantur in memoriam suam naturalem seu externam, et inde cogitationem, in quali fuerunt cum vixerunt in mundo, et quod incolis 
tunc aperiatur visus interior, seu visus spiritus illorum, et quod sic illis {4}appareant; addebant quod {5}incolae non aliter sciant quam quod sint homines suae telluris, et quod tunc primum appercipiant 
quod non sint, quando ex oculis eorum subito auferuntur; dicebam illis quod {6}similiter in nostra tellure antiquis temporibus factum fuerit, sicut cum Abrahamo, Sara, Lotho, {7}incolis Sodomae, 
Manoacho et ejus uxore, Joschua, Maria, (x)Zacharia, ac in genere cum prophetis, et quod Dominus similiter apparuerit, et qui viderunt non sciverint, antequam Se revelavit, aliter quam quod homo telluris 
esset; sed quod hodie hoc raro fiat, ex causa ne homines per talia cogantur ad credendum, nam fides coacta, qualis est quae intrat per miracula, non inhaeret, {8}et quoque damno foret illis apud 
quos fides per Verbum in statu non coacto implantari posset. @1 dabatur$ @2 i illa$ @3 i et$ @4 videantur; dicebant$ @5 illi$ @6 simile$ @7 omnibus incolis Sodomae, cum Manoacho, cum Joschua,
