<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5009节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5009.</strong>“逃出来到外边去了”表既然如此，它就没有那用来保护自己的真理了。这从他丢下衣裳后“逃出来到外边去了”的含义清楚可知：他丢下衣裳后“逃出来到外边去了”是指已经产生的分离，或这二者不再有任何共同之处的事实。所以，“衣裳”既表示最外层的真理，那么意思就是说它没有那用来保护自己的真理了，关于这个主题，可参看刚才所示（<a href="5008.htm">5008</a>e节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5009</b></p><p><b>5009.</b>
And fled, and got him out. That this signifies that thus truth spiritual natural had no truth by which to defend itself, is evident from the signification of "fleeing and getting out," after he had left 
his garment, as being that separation was effected, or that there was no longer anything in common; and consequently as a "garment" is ultimate truth, that it had no truth by which to defend itself 
(on which subject see what was shown just above, n. 5008e). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5009</b></p><p><b>5009.</b>
'And fled, and went out of doors' means that this being so it did not have that truth with which to protect itself. This is clear from the meaning of 'fleeing and going out of doors' after he had left 
his garment behind, as a separation that had taken place, or the fact that the two no longer had anything in common. Consequently, since 'a garment' means outermost truth, the meaning is that it had 
no truth with which to protect itself, regarding which see what has been shown immediately above, towards the end of <a href="5008.htm">5008</a>. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 5009</b>
</p><b>5009.</b>
`Et fugit et exivit foras': quod significet quod non ei verum per quod se defenderet, constat ex significatione `fugere et exire foras' postquam reliquit vestem quod sit quod separatio facta sit, 
seu quod nihil commune amplius esset, consequenter quia `vestis' est verum ultimum, quod non ei verum per quod se defenderet, de qua re videantur quae mox supra n. 5008 ad fin. ostensa sunt. </p>
