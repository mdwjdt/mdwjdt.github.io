<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3314节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3314.</strong>“利百加却爱雅各”表神圣理性的神性真理热爱真理的教义。这从“利百加”和“雅各”的代表清楚可知：“利百加”是指神圣理性的神性真理（对此，参看<a href="3012.htm">3012</a>，<a href="3013.htm">3013</a>，<a href="3077.htm">3077</a>节，以及整个前一章，那里论述了利百加）；“雅各”是指属世真理的教义，在至高意义是指主的神圣属世人的真理（参看<a href="3305.htm">3305</a>节）。至于神圣理性的神性良善热爱属世人里面的良善，神圣理性的神性真理热爱属世人里面的真理，情况是这样：构成理性的是良善与真理，构成属世人的也是良善与真理；理性人的良善既在没有真理的情况下流入，因而直接流入属世人的良善，又经由真理流入，因而间接流入；而理性人的良善经由理性人的真理流入属世人的真理，因而间接流入，也经由属世人的良善流入那里的真理，因而也间接流入。因此，理性人的良善与属世人的良善的结合，比它与属世人的真理的结合更紧密，这种结合就是“以撒爱以扫”所表示的；而理性人的真理与属世人的真理的结合，则比它与属世人的良善的结合更紧密，这种结合就是“利百加爱雅各”所表示的。<br />这些事都是些很难理解的事，尤其因为关于这个主题的最一般真理在这个世上，甚至在学术界是未知的。例如，这个世界不知道理性人与属世人截然不同，并且构成理性人与属世人这二者的，是良善与真理；更不知道理性人必须流入属世人，好让人能思考，并意愿他所思考的。只要这些最一般真理依然未知，人就很难理解前面所描述的流注是什么。然而，天使对这些事拥有光明，并觉察到无数细节。当他们同时被允许思想主在人性方面的神性时，这一过程还伴随着他们所在的快乐。人若处于良善，并且虽仍在肉身，却拥有天使之物在里面，也会被主赐予在这些事以及其它类似事上的某种快乐。但人若未处于良善，那么当思想事时，就会感到厌烦，并且当想到这些事适用于属主人性的神性时，更是厌烦。因此，不如让这种人把心思从这类事上移开，因为他们根本理解不了，甚至还会拒绝它们，发自内心说，这一切对我有什么用？既不能给我带来任何名誉，又不能带来任何物质利益。</p>

And Rebekah loved Jacob. That this signifies that the Divine truth of the Divine rational loved the doctrine of truth, is evident from the representation of Rebekah, as being the Divine truth of the 
Divine rational (concerning which see n. 3012, 3013, 3077, and the whole preceding chapter, where Rebekah is treated of); and from the representation of Jacob, as being the doctrine of natural truth, 
and in the supreme sense the Lord's Divine natural as to truth (see n. 3305). That the Divine good of the Divine rational loved the good which was in the natural, and the Divine truth of the Divine rational 
loved the truth which was in the natural, stands thus; It is good and truth that constitute the rational, and it is also good and truth that constitute the natural; the good of the rational flows 
in without truth-thus immediately-into the good of the natural; and also through truth, thus mediately; whereas the good of the rational flows in through the truth of the rational into the truth of 
the natural, thus mediately; and also through the good of the natural into the truth there, thus also immediately. Hence it is that there is a closer conjunction of the good of the rational with the 
good of the natural, than with its truth; which conjunction is signified by "Isaac loving Esau;" and that there is a closer conjunction of the truth of the rational with the truth of the natural, than 
with its good, which conjunction is signified by "Rebekah loving Jacob."  [2] These things are indeed such as can with difficulty be apprehended, for the reason especially that the world, even the learned 
world, is ignorant of the most general truths upon the subject-as that the rational is distinct from the natural, and that it is good and truth which constitute both the rational and the natural; 
and still less is it known that the rational must flow into the natural in order for man to be able to think, and to will as he thinks. As these most general truths are unknown, the influx spoken of 
above can with difficulty be comprehended; and yet these are matters in regard to which the angels have light, and perceive things innumerable, and this attended with the delight in which they are when 
it is given them at the same time to think concerning the Lord's Divine in respect to the Human. The man who is in good and in whom there is what is angelic while he is in the body, is also gifted 
with some light from the Lord on these and similar subjects; but he who is not in good feels a loathing when thinking of such things, and the more so the more he thinks of them as applied to the Divine 
that pertains to the Lord's Human. It is better therefore that those who are of such a nature should remove their mind from such subjects; for they comprehend nothing of them, and even reject them; 
saying at heart, What is this to me?  will bring me neither honors nor gain. </p>

'And Rebekah loved Jacob' means that the Divine Truth of the Divine Rational loved the doctrine of truth This is clear from the representation of 'Rebekah' as the Divine Truth of the Divine Rational, 
dealt with in <a href="3012.htm">3012</a>, <a href="3013.htm">3013</a>, <a href="3077.htm">3077</a>, and in the whole of the previous chapter where Rebekah is the subject, and from the representation of 'Jacob' as the doctrine of natural truth, and in the highest sense 
the Lord's Divine Natural as regards truth, dealt with in <a href="3305.htm">3305</a> With regard to the Divine Good of the Rational loving the Good belonging to the Natural, and the Divine Truth of the Divine Rational loving 
the Truth belonging to the Natural, the position is that there are good and truth that constitute the rational, and there are also good and truth that constitute the natural. The good of the rational 
flows into the good of the natural both independently of truth, thus into it directly, and also by way of truth, thus into it indirectly. But the good of the rational flows into the truth of the 
natural both by way of the truth of the rational, thus indirectly, and also by way of the good of the natural, thus again indirectly. Consequently rational good is joined more closely to natural good 
than to natural truth, a conjunction meant by 'Isaac loved Esau'; and rational truth is joined more closely to natural truth than to natural good, a conjunction meant by 'Rebekah loved Jacob'. </p>

These considerations are such indeed as can be grasped only with great difficulty, in particular because the most general features of all regarding this matter are unknown in the world, even among the 
learned. The world does not know, for example, that the rational is quite distinct and separate from the natural, or that good and truth are what constitute the rational and what constitute the natural, 
let alone that the rational flows into the natural enabling a person to think and to will what he thinks. As long as these very general features remain unknown, one can understand only with great 
difficulty what the influx described above is. Yet these are things in which angels have light, things in which they perceive countless details. And they do this with the delight which is theirs when 
they are permitted at the same time to think about the Lord's Divine in relation to His Human. Anyone who is governed by good, and who, though still in the body, has what is angelic within him, is also 
given some light by the Lord in these matters and others like them. But anyone who is not governed by good finds it irksome when he thinks about such matters, the more so when he thinks about those 
things as they apply to the Divine which belongs to the Lord's Human. It is better therefore if such people turn their minds away from those matters, for they have no grasp of them at all - indeed they 
reject them, saying at heart, What value is any of this to me? It doesn't bring me any honour, or any material gain. </p>

`Et Rebecca amans Jacobum':  quod significet quod Divinum Verum Divini Rationalis amaret doctrinam veri, constat a repraesentatione `Rebeccae' quod sit Divinum Verum Divini Rationalis, de qua n. 3012, 
3013, 3077, et in toto capite praecedente ubi de Rebecca agitur; et ex repraesentatione `Jacobi' quod sit doctrina veri naturalis, et in sensu supremo Domini Divinum Naturale quoad verum, de qua n. 
3305. Quod Divinum Bonum Rationalis amaret Bonum quod Naturali, et Divinum Verum Divini Rationalis amaret Verum quod Naturali, ita se habet: est bonum et {1}verum quod constituit rationale, et est quoque 
bonum et verum quod constituit naturale; bonum rationalis influit absque vero, ita immediate, in bonam naturalis, et quoque per verum, ita mediate; at bonum rationalis influit per veram rationalis 
in veram naturalis, ita mediate, et quoque per bonum naturalis in verum ibi, ita quoque mediate; inde est quod arctior conjunctio sit boni rationalis cum bono naturalis quam cum vero hujus, quae conjunctio 
significatur per quod `Jishak amaret Esavum'; et quod arctior conjunctio sit veri rationalis cum vero naturalis quam cum bono hujus, quae conjunctio significatur per quod `Rebecca amaret Jacobum.' 
[2] Haec quidem talia sunt quae aegre cadere possunt in captum, cumprimis ex causa quia omnium communissima hujus rei non sunt in orbe, ne quidem in erudito, nota, ut quod rationale sit distinctum 
a naturali, quodque bonum et verum sit quod constituit rationale et quod naturale, et minus quod rationale influat in naturale ut homo cogitare {2}possit, et velle sicut cogitat; cum haec quae communissima 
sunt, ignota {3}sunt, aegre potest capi influxus, de quo supra; haec sunt tamen in quibus angeli lucem habent et innumerabilia percipiunt, et hoc cum delectatione in qua sunt cum de Divino Domini 
quoad Humanum simul datur illis cogitare: homo qui est in bono et in quo angelicum dum est in corpore, etiam aliqua luce a Domino in his et similibus donatur, at qui non in bono est, taedium sentit 
cum de talibus cogitat, {4}et taedium eo majus {5} quo plus de illis cogitat applicate ad Divinum quod Humano Domini; qui itaque tales sunt, praestat ut animum removeant inde, nam nihil usque capiunt, 
immo rejiciunt, dicendo corde, Quid mihi hoc? non inde nihil honor, nec inde mihi lucrum. @1 i est$  @2 et velle potest sicut cogitat;$  @3 sint$  @4 quod$  @5 i fit$  </p>
