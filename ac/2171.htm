<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2171节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2171.</strong>“亚伯拉罕赶快进帐棚，到撒拉那里”表主的理性良善与祂的真理结合。这从目前所论述的“亚伯拉罕”和“撒拉”的代表，以及“帐棚”的含义清楚可知。在圣言中，每一个细节的含义都取决于内义所论述的主题，此处的细节也是如此。也就是说，它们尤其涉及主处于人性直觉时所进入的神性直觉。不过，不知道何为直觉的人不可能知道直觉的情形如何，更不知道有越来越内在的直觉存在，即有属世直觉，然后有理性直觉，最后有内在直觉，也就是神性，唯独主拥有这内在直觉。那些拥有诸如天使所具有的直觉之人十分清楚自己的直觉是哪个等级的，无论属世的，还是理性的，亦或更内在的直觉，对他们来说都是神性。那么，通过至高无限的神性（对此，参看<a href="1616.htm">1616</a>节末尾，<a href="1791.htm">1791</a>节）而拥有一种直觉的主是何情形呢？天使从来就没有主所具有的这种直觉，因为流入他们的直觉是从主至高或无限的神性经由祂的人性本质而来。<br />之所以描述主的直觉，是因为当主处于人性时，祂以这种方式知道神性本身、神性人和神圣活动如何在祂里面融合；然后知道祂的理性如何变成神性；最后知道将要通过祂，即通过祂里面人性本质与神性本质的融合而得救的人类的性质。这些就是本章所论述的主题。鉴于这些主题，也鉴于将要实现的融合本身，故此处首先描述主的直觉。</p>

Abraham hastened toward the tent unto Sarah. That this signifies the Lord's rational good conjoined with His truth, is evident from the representation of "Abraham," and also of "Sarah," and from the 
signification of a "tent," concerning which presently. As each and all things bear relation to the subject treated of in the internal sense, so do these words bear relation to the Divine perception into 
which the Lord came when He was in the perception of the human. But those who do not know what perception is, cannot know either how the case is with it, still less that there exists a perception that 
is more and more interior, namely, natural perception, then rational perception, and finally internal perception, which is Divine, and which the Lord alone had. They who are in perception, as are 
the angels, know very well in which perception they are; whether in natural, in rational, or in a still more interior perception which to them is Divine. What then must have been the case with the Lord, 
who had a perception from the Supreme and Infinite Divine (concerning which see n. 1616 at the end, 1791), in which no angels ever are, for perception flows into them from the Lord's Supreme or Infinite 
Divine through His Human Essence.  [2] The reason why the Lord's perception is described, is that when He was in the human, it was thus made known to Him how the Divine Itself, the Divine Human, 
and the Holy proceeding were to be united in Him; then, how His rational was to be made Divine; and finally what was the quality of the human race-that it was to be saved by Him, that is, by the union 
of the Human Essence with the Divine Essence in Him; which are the subjects treated of in this chapter. On these accounts the Lord's perception is first described, as also on account of the union itself 
which was to be effected. </p>

'Abraham hastened towards the tent to Sarah' means the Lord's rational good joined to His truth. This is clear from the representation of 'Abraham' and also of 'Sarah' and from the meaning of 'the tent', 
dealt with in the three paragraphs following this. Just as the meaning of any single detail in the Word is determined by whatever the subject is in the internal sense, so it is with the details here; 
that is to say, they relate specifically to the Divine perception into which the Lord entered when the perception of the human existed with Him. But people who do not know what perception is cannot 
know what it entails, still less that degrees of perception more and more interior exist - natural perception, then rational perception, and finally internal perception which is Divine and which only 
the Lord has had. Those who have perception, as angels do, know very well what their degree of perception is, whether it is natural, or rational, or a more interior perception still, which to them 
is Divine. How then must it have been with the Lord, whose perception came from the Supreme and Infinite Divine itself, dealt with in <a href="1616.htm">1616</a> (end), <a href="1791.htm">1791</a>? Angels never possess such perception as He had, 
for their perception flows into them from the Lord's Supreme or Infinite Divine by way of His Human Essence. The reason the Lord's perception is described is that when He was in the Human it was in this 
way made known to Him how the Divine itself, the Divine Human, and the Holy proceeding were to be united within Him; then how His Rational would be made Divine; and finally the nature of the human 
race which was to be saved through Him, that is, through the union of the Human Essence and the Divine Essence within Him. These are the matters dealt with in this chapter. It is on account of these that 
the Lord's perception is first described here, and also on account of the union itself which was to be effected. </p>

`Festinavit Abraham versus tentorium ad Sarah': quod significet rationale bonum Domini conjunctum vero Ipsius, constat ex repraesentatione `Abrahami,' tum `Sarae,' et a significatione `tentorii,' de 
qua mox.  Sicut omnia et singula se habent ad rem de qua agitur in sensu interno, ita haec, nempe ad perceptionem Divinam in illo venit Dominus, cum esset in perceptione humani; sed qui ignorant quid 
perceptio, nec scire possunt quomodo se cum perceptione habet, minus quod detur perceptio interior magis et magis, nempe perceptio naturalis, tum perceptio rationalis, demum perceptio interna quae Divina 
{1} et sola fuit Domino; qui in perceptione sunt, ut angeli, sciunt quam optime in qua sunt, num in naturali, vel in rationali, vel in interiore adhuc, quae illis est Divina; quid non Dominus, Cui 
fuit perceptio ab Ipso Supremo et Infinito Divino, de qua n. 1616 ad fin., 1791, in qua nusquam aliqui angeli, nam in illos influit perceptio a Supremo aut Infinito Divino Domini per Humanum Ipsius 
Essentiam: quod describatur perceptio Domini, causa est quia cum fuit in Humano: ita notum Ipsi factum quomodo in Ipso uniretur Divinum Ipsum: Humanum Divinum, et Sanctum procedens, dein quomodo Rationale 
Ipsius fieret Divinum, demum quale sit genus humanum, quod per Ipsum, hoc est, per unionem Humanae Essentiae cum Divina in Ipso: salvaretur; de quibus in hoc capite agitur; propter haec describitur 
{2} primum perceptio Domini, tum etiam propter ipsam unitionem quae fieret. 	@1 quae.$ 	@2 i hic.$ </p>
