<p><strong>[NCE]1836.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1836/bible_king-james-version_genesis_15_12" target=_top>Genesis 15:12</a>. And the sun was about to set, and slumber fell on Abram, and look — terror of immense shadows was falling on him!<br />The sun was about to set symbolizes the period preceding the end, and conditions then. And slumber fell on Abram means that the church was then in shadow. And look — terror of immense shadows was falling on him means that the shadows were frightening; shadows are falsities. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1836</b></p><p><b>1836.</b>
Verse 12. And it came to pass when the sun was going down, that a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and behold a terror of great darkness falling upon him. "The sun was going down," signifies the time and 
the state before the consummation; "that a deep sleep fell upon Abram," signifies that the church was then in darkness; "and behold a terror of great darkness falling upon him," signifies that the darkness 
was terrible; "darkness" means falsities. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1836</b></p><p><b>1836.</b>
Verse 12 And as the sun was going down a deep sleep came over Abram, and, behold, a dread of a great darkness was coming over him. </p>
<p>'As the sun was going down' means the period of time and the state 
just before the close. 'And a deep sleep came over Abram' means that the Church was at that time in darkness. 'And, behold, a dread of great darkness was coming over him' means that it was a dreadful 
darkness, darkness' being falsities. </p>

</p><b>1836.</b>
Vers. 12.  Et fuit sol ad occidendum, et sopor cecidit super Abramum, et ecce terror tenebrarum magnarum cadens super illum.  'Fuit sol ad occidendum' significat tempus et statum ante consummationem: 
'et sopor cecidit super Abramum' significat quod Ecclesia tunc in tenebris esset: 'et ecce terror tenebrarum magnarum cadens super illum' significat quod tenebrae terribiles essent; 'tenebrae' sunt 
falsitates. </p>
