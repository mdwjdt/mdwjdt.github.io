<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5750.</strong>创世记44:6-10.他追上他们，将这些话对他们说了。他们对他说，我主为什么说这样的话呢？你仆人断不能作这样的事。你看，我们从前在袋口里所发现的银子，尚且从迦南地带回来还你，我们怎能从你主人家里偷窃金银呢？你仆人中，无论在谁那里找着了，就叫他死，我们也作我主的奴仆。他说，现在就照你们的话就这样行吧！在谁那里找着了，谁就作我的奴仆，你们就没有罪。<br />“他追上他们”表与它们的间接联结。“将这些话对他们说了”表这事的流注。“他们对他说”表觉知。“我主为什么说这样的话呢”表反思为何这种事会流入。“你仆人断不能作这样的事”表当这事不是他们意愿的意图时。“你看，我们从前在袋口里所发现的银子”表当真理被白白赐下时。“尚且从迦南地带回来还你”表由于宗教信仰而交付。“我们怎能从你主人家里偷窃金银呢”表为何我们声称来自神性属天层的真理与良善属于自己呢。“你仆人中，无论在谁那里找着了，就叫他死”表做这种事的人会受到诅咒。“我们也作我主的奴仆”表他们将永远是附属者，没有自己的自由。“他说，现在就照你们的话”表的确如此，正如公义所要求的那样。“就这样行吧”表从轻处罚。“在谁那里找着了，谁就作我的奴仆”表与这事物同在的人将永远没有自己的自由。“你们就没有罪”表其余的人各都是自己的主人，因为他们没有分担过错。</p>

Verses 6-10. And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these words. And they said unto him, Wherefore speaketh my lord according to these words? Far be it from thy servants to do according to this 
word. Behold, the silver which we found in our bag's mouth we brought back to thee out of the land of Canaan; and how should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold? With whomsoever of thy servants 
it be found, let him die, and we also will be to my lord for servants. And he said, Now also according to your words so be it; he with whom it is found shall be to me a servant, and ye shall be 
blameless. "And he overtook them," signifies mediate adjunction; "and he spake unto them these words," signifies the influx of this thing; "and they said unto him," signifies perception; "Wherefore speaketh 
my lord according to these words?" signifies reflection why such a thing flows in; "far be it from thy servants to do according to this word," signifies when it is not from the will; "behold the 
silver which we found in our bags' mouth," signifies when truth was bestowed gratuitously; "we brought back to thee out of the land of Canaan," signifies submitted from a principle of religion; "and 
how should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?" signifies why then shall we claim to ourselves truth and good, which are from the Divine celestial; "with whomsoever of thy servants it be 
found, let him die," signifies that he is damned who does so; "and we also will be to my lord for servants," signifies that they will be associates forever without freedom from their own; "and he said, 
Now also according to your words," signifies that indeed it would be so from justice; "so be it," signifies a milder sentence; "he with whom it is found shall be to me a servant," signifies that he 
with whom it is shall be forever without freedom of his own; "and ye shall be blameless," signifies that the rest shall be at their own disposal, because not sharing in the fault. </p>

Verses 6-10 And he overtook them, and spoke those words to them. And they said to him, Why does my lord speak words such as these? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing as this. Behold, the 
silver which we found in the mouth of our pouches we brought back to you from the land of Canaan; and how could we steal from your lord's house silver or gold? With whomever of your servants it is found, 
let him die; and we also will be slaves to my lord. And he said, Now also, according to your words, so let it be: He with whom it is found will be my slave, and you will be innocent. </p>
<p>'And he overtook 
them' means an indirect link with them. 'And spoke those words to them' means the influx of this thing. 'And they said to him' means a discernment. 'Why does my lord speak words such as these?' 
means reflection as to why such a thing flows in. 'Far be it from your servants to do such a thing as this' means when this thing is not the intention of their will. 'behold, the silver which we found 
in the mouth of our pouches' means when truth freely given. 'We brought back to you from the land of Canaan' means has been submitted, as the result of religious belief. 'And how could we steal from 
your lord's house silver or gold?' means, Why should we lay claim to truth or good that comes from the Divine celestial? 'With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die' means that the one 
who does such a thing stands condemned. 'And we also will be slaves to my lord' means that they will be adjuncts forever, without freedom of their own. 'And he said, Now also, according to your words' 
means indeed so, as justice demands. 'So let it be' means a less severe sentence. 'He with whom it is found will be my slave' means that the one with whom that thing is present will forever be without 
his own freedom. 'And you will be innocent' means that each of the rest will be his own master since they are not involved in the blame. </p>

Vers. 6-10.  Et assecutus illos, et locutus ad illos verba illa.  Et dixerunt ad illum, Quapropter loquitur dominus meus juxta verba haec? absit servis tuis a faciendo juxta verbum hoc.  Ecce argentum 
quod invenimus in ore manticarum nostrarum, reduximus ad te e terra  Canaan; et quomodo furabimur e domo domini tui argentum vel aurum? Cum quo invenitur e servis tuis, et moriatur, et etiam nos erimus 
domino meo in servos.  Et dixit, Etiam nunc secundum verba vestra, ita id; cum quo invenitur, erit mihi servus, et vos eritis insontes.  `Et assecutus illos' significat adjunctionem mediatam:  `et 
locutus ad illos verba illa' significat influxum hujus rei:  `et dixerunt ad illum' significat apperceptionem: `Quapropter loquitur dominus meus juxta verba haec significat reflexionem, cur tale influit: 
 `absit servis tuis a faciendo juxta verbum hoc significat' cum non sit ex voluntate:  `ecce argentum quod invenimus in ore manticarum nostrarum' significat cum verum gratis donatum:  `(x)reduximus 
ad te e terra Canaan' significat {1}submissum sit ex religioso:  `et quomodo furabimur e domo domini tui argentum vel aurum?' significat cur tunc vindicabimus nobis verum et bonum quod a caelesti 
Divino:  `cum quo invenitur e servis tuis, et moriatur' significat quod damnatus qui tale facit:  `et etiam nos erimus domino meo in servos' significat quod associati erunt absque libero e proprio in 
perpetuum:  `et dixit, Etiam nunc secundum verba vestra' significat quod quidem ita ex justitia: `ita id' significat mitiorem sententiam: `cum quo invenitur, erit {2}servus meus' significat quod apud 
quem id, is in perpetuum absque proprio libero erit:  `et vos eritis insontes' significat quod reliqui sui juris, quia non simul in culpa. @1 A had quod submissum sit, but deleted quod$ @2 thus A I
