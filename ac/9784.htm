<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9784节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9784.</strong>“在会幕中”表主的同在所在的地方。这从以下事实清楚可知：会幕被造是为了主可以在那里与摩西、亚伦，以及以色列人相会。因此，敬拜的神圣行为也在那里执行，这从下列出埃及记的经文可以看出来：<br />他们要在耶和华面前，会幕门口，不断献上燔祭。我要在那里与你们相会，和你们说话。我要在那里与以色列人相会，会幕就要因我的荣耀成为圣。我要使会幕和坛成圣，也要使亚伦和他的儿子成圣，给我供祭司的职分。我要住在以色列人中间。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.42.htm">29:42</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.45.htm">45</a>）<br />主在那里与他们相会，也就是说，祂在那里同在，这一点从另一处经文可以看出来：<br />当这一切完成时，云彩遮盖会幕，耶和华的荣耀就充满了居所。摩西不能进会幕，因为云彩住在其上，并且耶和华的荣耀充满了居所。日间，耶和华的云彩是在居所以上；夜间，云中有火，在以色列全家的眼前。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出40.33.htm">40:33</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出40.38.htm">38</a>）<br />由此可见，“会幕”表示主同在所在的地方。原因在于，帐幕代表天堂，天堂凭主在那里的同在而为天堂；因此，它也被称为“耶和华的居所”。</p>

In the Tent of meeting. That this signifies where is the presence of the Lord, is evident from the fact that the Tent was made in order that the Lord might there meet Moses and Aaron, and also the sons 
of Israel. Therefore also what is holy of worship was instituted there, as can be seen from the following passages in Exodus: </p>
<p>     They shall make a continual burnt-offering at the door of the Tent 
of meeting before Jehovah; where I will meet with you, to speak there with thee. And there I will meet with the sons of Israel; and it shall be sanctified by My glory. And I will sanctify the Tent of 
meeting, and the altar. Aaron also and his sons will I sanctify, that they may minister to Me in the priesthood. And I will dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel (Exod. 29:42-45). And that the Lord 
met with them there, that is, that He was present there, can be seen from this passage: </p>
<p>     When all things were finished, the cloud covered the Tent of meeting, and the glory of Jehovah filled 
the Habitation. And Moses could not enter into the Tent of meeting, because the cloud dwelt upon it, and the glory of Jehovah filled the Habitation. The cloud of Jehovah was upon the Habitation by day; 
and there was fire therein by night, in the eyes of all the house of Israel (Exod. 40:33, to the end). </p>
<p>From all this it can be seen that by "the Tent of meeting" is signified where the presence of 
the Lord is. The reason was that the Tent represented heaven, and heaven is heaven by virtue of the presence of the Lord in it, on which account also it was called "the Habitation of Jehovah." </p>

'In the tent of meeting' means the Lord's presence. This is clear from the consideration that the tent was made for the express purpose of providing a place for the Lord to meet Moses and Aaron, and 
also the children of Israel. Therefore also the holy act of worship was performed there, as the following verses in Exodus make clear,  </p>
<blockquote>
They shall make the continual burnt offering at the door of the 
tent of meeting before Jehovah, where I will meet you to speak to you there. And there I will meet the children of Israel; and it shall be sanctified by My glory. And I will sanctify the tent of meeting 
and the altar; and Aaron and his sons I will sanctify to perform the priestly function for Me. And I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2029:42-45&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 29:42-45</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And there is another place 
which declares that the Lord would meet them there or would be present there,  </p>
<blockquote>
When all these things had been completed the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of Jehovah filled the 
dwelling-place. And Moses could not enter the tent of meeting, because the cloud dwelt over it, and the glory of Jehovah filled the dwelling-place. The cloud of Jehovah was over the dwelling-place 
by day, and fire was in it by night, in the eyes of all the house of Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2040:33-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 40:33-end</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>From these places it becomes clear that 'the tent of meeting' means the place where the Lord's presence 
is. It does so because the tent represented heaven, and heaven is heaven by virtue of the Lord's presence there, on which account also it was called Jehovah's dwelling-place.  </p>

</p><b>9784.</b>
`In tentorio conventus':  quod significet praesentiam Domini {1}, constat ex eo quod tentorium ideo factum sit ut Dominus ibi conveniret Moschen et Aharonem, ut et filios Israelis, ideo etiam sanctum 
cultus ibi instituebatur, ut constare potest ex his sequentibus in Exodo {2},      	Holocaustum jugis facient ad ostium tentorii conventus coram Jehovah, ubi conveniam vos, ad loquendum tecum ibi, 
{3} et conveniam ibi filios Israelis; et sanctificabitur per gloriam Meam; et sanctificabo tentorium conventus, et altare, et Aharonem, et filios ejus sanctificabo, ut sacerdotio fungantur Mihi, et habitabo 
in medio filiorum Israelis, xxix 42-45; </p>
<p>et quod Dominus ibi convenerit illos, seu praesens fuerit ibi, alibi,      	Cum absoluta erant omnia, obtexit nubes tentorium conventus, et gloria Jehovae 
implevit habitaculum, nec potuit Moscheh intrare in tentorium conventus, eo quod habitaret super eo nubes, et gloria Jehovae impleret habitaculum; nubes Jehovae fuit super habitaculo interdiu, et 
ignis fuit noctu in eo, in oculis omnis domus Israelis, Exod. xl 33-fin.; </p>
<p>ex his constare potest quod per `tentorium conventus' significetur ubi praesentia Domini; causa quod ita, erat quia tentorium 
repraesentabat caelum, et caelum est caelum ex praesentia Domini ibi; ideo etiam vocabatur habitaculum Jehovae. @1 cp n. 9778$ @2 in sequentibus hujus Libri Exodi$ @3 See p. ix preliminary note i.
