<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4642节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4642.</strong>“以扫就是以东”表主的神性人身的属世和肉体层级。这从“以东”的代表清楚可知，“以东”是指在与真理的教义事物联结的属世良善方面（参看<a href="3302.htm">3302</a>，<a href="3322.htm">3322</a>，<a href="4241.htm">4241</a>节），因而在属世和肉体层级方面的主的神性人身。因为教义事物就像真理的身体；也就是说，它们在灵义上形成属世真理的肉体部分。正因如此，“以东”代表主的神性人身的属世和肉体层级。教义可以说是真理的化身，或就像真理的肉体遮盖物，因为教义本身并非真理，但真理在教义里面，如同灵魂在肉体里面。<br />接下来的几节论述的主题是主的神性属世良善。不过，它的衍生物纯由名字来描述，原因如前所述，即：该良善的衍生物远远超出任何人的理解力，甚至超出天使的理解力。因为天使是有限的，有限的不可能理解无限的。即便如此，当阅读本章时，包含在这些名字里面的衍生物就凭借来自主的一种神性之爱的流注以一种总体印象被传给天使，这种流注则凭借赋予他们对何为神性良善的一种感觉的天上火焰。<br />人若以为圣言哪怕就其一点一划而言，不是被启示的，或以为它是以任何其它方式，而不是以每一个系列皆代表神性事物，因而代表属天和属灵事物，并且每一个字皆表示这些事物的方式被启示，必以为这些名字无非是在说明以扫的家谱。但家谱与圣言有什么相干呢？难道家谱含有神性之物在里面？但在圣言中，所有名字都表示真实事物（参看<a href="1224.htm">1224</a>，<a href="1264.htm">1264</a>，<a href="1876.htm">1876</a>，<a href="1888.htm">1888</a>，<a href="4442.htm">4442</a>节，以及解释名字灵义的地方）。</p>

He is Edom. That this signifies the Lord's Divine Human in respect to the natural and the corporeal, is evident from the representations of Edom as being the Lord's Divine Human in respect to natural 
good, to which are adjoined the doctrinal things of truth (see n. 3302, 3322, 4241), thus in respect to the natural and the corporeal. For doctrinal things are like a body to truth, or in a spiritual 
sense are the bodily things of natural truth. Hence it is that by Edom is represented the Lord's Divine Human in respect to the natural and the corporeal. Doctrine is as it were the embodiment of truth, 
because doctrine is not in itself truth, but truth is in doctrine as the soul in its body.  [2] In what now follows the Lord's Divine good natural is treated of, but its derivations are described 
by names for the reason stated above-that the derivations of this good transcend the understanding of everyone, even that of an angel. For the angels are finite, and what is finite does not comprehend 
what is infinite. Nevertheless when this chapter is read, the derivations contained in the names are represented to angels in a general way by the influx of Divine love from the Lord, and the influx 
by a celestial flame which affects them with Divine good. [3] He who believes that the Word is not inspired as to its smallest jot, and he who believes that it is inspired in any other way than that 
each single series represents Divine things, and thence heavenly and spiritual things, and that each single word signifies these, must needs suppose that these names involve nothing more than the genealogies 
from Esau. But what are genealogies to the Word? And what is there Divine in them? (But that the names in the Word all signify real things may be seen above, n. 1224, 1264, 1876, 1888, 4442, 
and in every place where their signification is unfolded.) </p>

'He being Edom' means the Natural and bodily degree of the Lord's Divine Human. This is clear from the representation of 'Edom' as the Lord's Divine Human as regards natural good to which doctrinal matters 
concerning truth have been allied, dealt with in <a href="3302.htm">3302</a>, <a href="3322.htm">3322</a>, <a href="4241.htm">4241</a>, and so as regards the Natural and bodily degree. For so far as their relationship to truth is concerned matters of doctrine are 
so to speak its body; that is, in the spiritual sense they form the bodily parts of natural truth This explains why 'Edom' represents the Natural and bodily degree of the Lord's Divine Human. The reason 
why doctrine is like the bodily covering given to truth is that in itself doctrine is not truth; rather truth resides within doctrine as the soul does within the body. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the verses that follow 
now the subject is the Lord's Divine Natural Good. But mere names are used to describe the derivatives within this, for the reason, as stated above, that the derivatives within that Good are far 
beyond the understanding any man possesses, and even beyond that of an angel. For angels are finite beings, and that which is finite cannot comprehend that which is Infinite. Even so, when this chapter 
is read a general impression is conveyed to angels of the derivatives contained in the names that are given. It is conveyed to them by an influx of Divine Love from the Lord, and this influx by a heavenly 
flame which gives them a feeling for what Divine Good is. </p>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 Anyone who thinks that the Word is not inspired even to the smallest letter, or who thinks that the Word is inspired in some other 
manner than one in which strings of detailed information represent Divine matters, and so also celestial and spiritual ones, and that such strings of information have those matters as their spiritual 
meaning, cannot do other than suppose that the names used imply nothing more than genealogical details to do with the people descended from Esau. What real connection do genealogical details have 
with the Word; do they have anything Divine within them? But all names in the Word have spiritual realities as their meaning, see <a href="1224.htm">1224</a>, <a href="1264.htm">1264</a>, <a href="1876.htm">1876</a>, <a href="1888.htm">1888</a>, <a href="4442.htm">4442</a>, as well as every other place where explanations 
are given regarding the spiritual meanings of names. </p>

`Ipse Edom': quod significet Divinum Humanum Domini quoad Naturale et corporeum, constat (c)ex repraesentatione `Edomi' quod sit Divinum Humanum Domini quoad bonum naturale cui adjuncta doctrinalia 
veri, de qua n. 3302, 3322, 4241, ita quoad Naturale et corporeum, nam doctrinalia sunt instar corporis vero, seu in spirituali sensu sunt corporea veri naturalis; inde est quod per `Edomum' repraesentetur 
Divinum Humanum Domini quoad Naturale et corporeum; quod doctrina sit velut corporatura veri, est quia doctrina non in se est verum, sed in doctrina est verum sicut anima in suo corpore. 
 In sequentibus nunc agitur de Divino Bono Naturali Domini, 2 sed ejus derivationes describuntur per nomina ex causa, ut supra dictum, quia derivationes illius Boni excedunt intellectum cujusvis 
hominis, etiam angli; angeli enim finiti sunt, et finitum non capit Infinitum; sed usque cum legitur hoc caput, derivationes quae continentur in nominibus, repraesentantur angelis communiter per {1}influxum 
Divini Amoris a Domino, et influxus per caelestem 3 flammam, quae afficit illos Divino Bono.  Qui credit quod Verbum non inspiratum sit quoad minimam iotam, et qui credit quod Verbum aliter 
inspiratum sit quam ut singulae series {2}repraesentent Divina, (c)et inde caelestia et spiritualia, et singulae voces illa significent, non aliter opinari potest quam quod nomina haec nihil plus 
involvant quam genealogica ex Esavo; sed quid genealogica {3} ad Verbum, et quid Divinum in illis? seu quod nomina in Verbo omnia significent res, videatur n. 1224, 1264, 1876, 1888, 4442, et ubivis 
alibi ubi explicatum quid nomina significarunt.(n)      @1 After Domino$      @2 After spiritualia$      @3 i Esavi$ </p>
