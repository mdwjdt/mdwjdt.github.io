Verses 9-11. While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with the flock which was her father's, for she was a shepherdess. And it came to pass when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's 
brother, and the flock of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob came near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother. And Jacob kissed Rachel, 
and lifted up his voice and wept. "While he was yet speaking with them," signifies thought on that occasion; "Rachel came with the flock," signifies the affection of the interior truth which is of 
the church and of doctrine; "which was her father's," signifies from good in respect to origin; "for she was a shepherdess," signifies that the affection of interior truth teaches what is in the Word; 
"and it came to pass when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother," signifies the acknowledgment of the affection of that truth in regard to its origin; "and the flock of Laban his 
mother's brother," signifies the church and the doctrine therefrom; "that Jacob came near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth," signifies that the Lord from natural good has opened the Word 
as to its interiors; "and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother," signifies instruction; "and Jacob kissed Rachel," signifies love toward interior truths; "and lifted up his voice and wept," 
signifies the ardor of love. </p>

Verses 9-11 While he was still speaking to them Rachel came with the flock which was her father's, for she was a shepherdess. And so it was, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, 
and the flock of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob came near and rolled the stone from over the mouth of the well, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother. And Jacob kissed Rachel, 
and lifted up his voice and wept. </p>
<p>'While he was still speaking to them' means thought during that time. 'Rachel came with the flock' means the affection for interior truth belonging to the Church 
and to doctrine. 'Which was her father's' means from good in origin. 'For she was a shepherdess' means that the affection for interior truth contained in the Word is that which teaches. 'And so it 
was, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother' means an acknowledgement of the affection for that truth as to its origin. 'And the flock of Laban his mother's brother' means 
the Church and doctrine from that origin. 'That Jacob came near and rolled the stone from over the mouth of the well' means that the Lord, by virtue of natural good, disclosed the interior contents of 
the Word. 'And watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother' means instruction. 'And Jacob kissed Rachel' means love directed towards interior truths. 'And lifted up his voice and wept' means the 
warmth of love. </p>

Vers. 9-11.  Adhuc ille loquens cum illis, et Rachel veni cum grege, qui patri ejus, quia pastor illa.  Et fuit, ut vidit Jacob Rachelem filiam Labanis fratris matris suae, et gregem Labanis fratris 
matris suae, et accessit Jacob, et devolvit lapidem a super ore putei, et potavit gregem Labanis fratris matris suae.  Et osculatus est Jacob Rachelem, et sustulit vocem suam, et flevit. `Adhuc 
ille loquens cum illis' significat cogitationem tunc: `et Rachel venit cum grege' significat affectionem veri interioris quae Ecclesiae et doctrinae: `qui patri ejus' significat ex bono quoad originem: 
`quia pastor illa' significat quod affectio veri interioris quod in Verbo, doceat: `et fuit, ut vidit Jacob Rachelem filiam Labanis fratris matris suae' significat agnitionem affectionis illius 
veri ex qua origine: `et gregem Labanis fratris matris suae' significat Ecclesiam et doctrinam inde: `et accessit Jacob, et devolvit lapidem a super ore putei' significat Dominum ex bono naturali 
retexisse Verbum quoad interiora: `et potavit gregem Labanis fratris matris suae' significat instructionem: `et osculatus est Jacob Rachelem' significat amorem erga vera interiora: `et sustulit vocem 
suam et flevit' significat amoris ardorem. </p>
