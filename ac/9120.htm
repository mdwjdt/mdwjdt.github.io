<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9120.</strong>举例说明何为良心。如果有人在别人不知道的情况下拥有他的财产，这使得他可以不用担心法律，也不用担心失去地位或名声而为自己留下这些财产；然而，他仍将它们退还给对方，因为它们不是他自己的，那么他就有良心。他为了良善而行良善，为了公正而行公正。或者，如果有人有机会获得一个显赫的职位，然后看到另一个寻求这个职位的人对国家更有用，便为了国家的利益而把这个职位让给对方，那么他就有良心。其它一切例子也是如此。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9120</b></p><p><b>9120.</b>
What Conscience is may also be illustrated by examples. If, unknown to the other, a man has the property of that other in his possession, and thus can keep it for himself without any fear of the law, 
or of the loss of honor and reputation, and nevertheless restores it to the other because it is not his own, he has Conscience, for he does what is good for the sake of what is good, and what is just 
for the sake of what is just. Again, if a man who has it in his power to attain a high position, sees that another, who also is a candidate, would be more useful to his country, and yields the position 
to this other man for the sake of his country's good, he has Conscience. So in all other cases. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9120</b></p><p><b>9120.</b>
Let examples also demonstrate what conscience is. If someone has in his possession another person's goods without that person's knowing it, which makes it possible for him to keep them without fear of 
the law, loss of position, or loss of reputation, and yet he returns those goods to the other person because they are not his own, he has conscience. He does what is good for its own sake, and what 
is right for its own sake. Or if someone has the opportunity to attain an eminent position, and then, on seeing that another who seeks it is more useful to the country, yields the position to that other 
person for the sake of the country's good, he has conscience. And so on with all other examples.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 9120</b>
</p><b>9120.</b>
Exempla etiam illustrent quid conscientia: qui alterius bona apud se habet, nesciente altero, et sic absque timore legis, jacturae honoris et famae, potest lucrari illa, si usque illa alteri reddit 
quia sua non sunt, is conscientiam habet; nam facit bonum propter bonum, ac justum propter justum.  Sit quoque: qui potest venire ad dignitatem, sed videt quod alter qui etiam ambit patriae utilior sit, 
is si cedat alteri locum propter bonum patriae, is conscientiam habet.  Ita in reliquis. </p>
