<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1168节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1168.</strong>创世记10:7.古实的儿子是西巴、哈腓拉、撒弗他、拉玛、撒弗提迦。拉玛的儿子是示巴、底但。<br />“古实的儿子”表那些没有内在敬拜，但有对信的认知之人，他们的宗教信仰仅在于具有这类认知。“西巴、哈腓拉、撒弗他、拉玛、撒弗提迦”是指具有这类认知的很多民族，因为在内义上，这些民族表认知本身。“拉玛的儿子”同样表那些没有内在敬拜，但有对信的认知之人，他们的宗教信仰只在于具有这类认知。“示巴、底但”是指具有这些认知的民族，因为在内义上，这些民族表认知本身，唯一的区别是，“古实的儿子”表对属灵事物的认知，“拉玛的儿子”表对属天事物的认知。</p>

And the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca. And the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.<br />The sons of Cush symbolize people who did not have inward worship but did have religious knowledge, the possession of which they considered to be religion. Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca, are individual nations among whom that knowledge was extant, while at a deeper level they symbolize the knowledge itself. The sons of Raamah also symbolize people who did not have inward worship but did have religious knowledge, the possession of which they considered to be religion. Sheba and Dedan are individual nations among whom that knowledge was extant, while at a deeper level they symbolize the knowledge itself. The difference is that the sons of Cush symbolize a knowledge of spiritual qualities while the sons of Raamah symbolize a knowledge of heavenly qualities. </p>

Verse 7. And the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca. And the sons of Raamah: Sheba, and Dedan. By "the sons of Cush" are signified those who had not internal worship, 
but who had the knowledges of faith, in the possession of which they made religion to consist. "Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca" are so many nations with whom there were such 
knowledges. By the same in the internal sense the knowledges themselves are signified. By "the sons of Raamah," likewise, are signified those who had not internal worship, but had knowledges of faith, 
in the possession of which they made religion to consist. "Sheba and Dedan" are nations who had such knowledges. By the same in the internal sense are signified the knowledges themselves; but with the 
difference that by "the sons of Cush" are signified knowledges of spiritual things, and by "the sons of Raamah," knowledges of celestial things. </p>

Verse 7 And the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteka. And the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan. 'The sons of Cush' means those who did not have internal worship but cognitions 
of faith, and who made religion consist merely in the possessing of such cognitions. 'Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteka' are just so many nations with whom these existed, for in the internal 
sense these same nations mean cognitions themselves. 'The sons of Raamah' similarly means those who had no internal worship but cognitions of faith, in the mere possession of which they made religion 
consist. 'Sheba and Dedan' are nations with whom these cognitions existed, for by those same nations cognitions themselves are meant in the internal sense, though with this difference, that cognitions 
of spiritual things are meant by 'the sons of Cush', cognitions of celestial things by 'the sons of Raamah'. </p>

Vers. 7.  Et filii Cush; Seba et Havilah, et Sabtah, et Raamah, et Sabteca.  Et filii Raamae, Sheba et Dedan.  Per 'filios Cush' significantur illi qui internum cultum non habuerunt sed cognitiones 
fidei in quibus possidendis religionem posuerunt:  'Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, et Sabteca' sunt totidem gentes apud quas fuerunt; in sensu interno per easdem significantur ipsae cognitiones:  per 
'filios Raamae' similiter significantur illi qui internum cultum non habuerunt sed cognitiones fidei in quibus possidendis religionem posuerunt:  'Sheba et Dedan' sunt gentes apud quas fuerunt; in sensu 
interno per easdem significantur ipsae cognitiones sed cum differentia; per 'filios Cush' significantur cognitiones spiritualium, per 'filios Raamae' cognitiones caelestium. </p>
