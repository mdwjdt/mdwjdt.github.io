<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2335节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2335.</strong>“我们要在街上过夜”表祂可以说愿意通过真理审判。这从“街”和“过夜”的含义清楚可知。“街”在圣言各处都有所提及，在内义上和“道路”的意思一样，即表示真理。因为街就是城内的道路，这从紧接下来的经文明显可知。此处“过夜”是指审判，这可从“夜”的含义看出来。前面说明（<a href="2323.htm">2323</a>节），“晚上”表最后之前的教会的状态，也就是开始没有信的时候，还表示先于审判的造访。由此清楚可知，随后而来的“夜”就是最后的状态，这时已没有了信；而且“夜”还是进行审判的时候。由此明显可知，“在街上过夜”在内义上表示通过真理审判。<br />关于审判，它是双重的，也就是说，既通过良善审判，也通过真理审判。有信者通过良善受审判，无信者通过真理受审判。有信者通过良善受审判，这明显可见于马太福音（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.34.htm">25:34</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.40.htm">40</a>），而无信者通过真理受审判（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.41.htm">25:41</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.46.htm">46</a>）。通过良善受审判就会得救，因为他们接受良善；而通过真理受审判就会被定罪，因为他们拒绝良善。良善是主的，那些在生活和信仰中承认这一点的人是主的，并因此得救。而那些在生活，因而在信仰中不承认这一点的人无法成为主的，因此无法得救。所以，他们照其生活行为并思维和目的受审判。当照这些受审判时，他们不可避免地被定罪。因为真相是，只要主不拦阻人，人凭自己只能行出、思想、图谋恶事，并且凭自己只会冲向地狱。<br />关于通过真理审判，情况是这样：若非通过良善，主从不审判任何人；因为祂渴望将所有人，无论有多少，都提入天堂，事实上，若有可能，甚至提升到祂自己那里。因为主是怜悯本身和良善本身，怜悯本身和良善本身绝不会定任何人的罪。正是人给自己定罪，因为他拒绝良善。他因在肉身生活期间习惯逃避良善，故在来世也逃避它，并因此逃避天堂与主，因为主只存在于良善中。祂也存在于真理中，但不存在于脱离良善的真理中。主不定任何人的罪，也就是说，不将他们判入地狱，祂在约翰福音中说：<br />神差他的儿子降世，不是要定世人的罪，乃是要叫世人藉着祂得救。这就是审判：光来到世间，世人因自己的行为是恶的，不爱光倒爱黑暗。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.17.htm">3:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.19.htm">19</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />若有人听见我的话不相信，我不审判他。我来本不是要审判世界，乃是要拯救世界。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.47.htm">12:47</a>）<br />另外，可参看之前有关该主题的内容（<a href="223.htm">223</a>，<a href="245.htm">245</a>，<a href="592.htm">592</a>，<a href="696.htm">696</a>，<a href="1093.htm">1093</a>，<a href="1683.htm">1683</a>，<a href="1874.htm">1874</a>，<a href="2258.htm">2258</a>节）。<br />前面论述审判的地方（<a href="2320.htm">2320</a>，<a href="2321.htm">2321</a>节）说明，按照主在约翰福音中的话，一切审判属于主的神圣人性和神圣活动：<br />父不审判什么人，乃将审判的事全交与子。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.22.htm">5:22</a>）<br />然而现在又说主不通过定人的罪而审判。由此明显可知就文字而言，圣言是何性质：若不从另外一种含义，即通过内义来理解，圣言是不能理解的。唯独内义才能说明审判究竟是怎么回事。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2335</b></p><p><b>2335.</b>
For we will pass the night in the street. That this signifies that he was as it were desirous to judge from truth, may be seen from the signification of a "street," and from the signification of "passing 
the night." A "street" is often named in the Word, and in the internal sense signifies the same as a "way," namely, truth-for a street is a way in a city-as will be evident from the passages that 
will soon follow. That "to pass the night" is here to judge, may be seen from the signification of "night." It was shown above (n. 2323) that "evening" signifies the state of the church before the last, 
when there begins to be no faith; and also the visitation which precedes the Judgment. From this it is evident that "night," which succeeds, is the last state, when there is no faith; also that it 
is the Judgment. It is clear from this that to "pass the night in the street," in the internal sense denotes to judge from truth. [2] As regards Judgment it is twofold, namely, from good and from truth. 
The faithful are judged from good, but the unfaithful from truth. That the faithful are judged from good, is plainly evident in Matthew (Matt. 25:34-40), and that the unfaithful are judged from truth 
(Matt. 25:41-46). To be judged from good is to be saved because they have received it; but to be judged from truth is to be condemned because they have rejected good. Good is the Lord's, and they 
who acknowledge this in life and faith are the Lord's, and therefore are saved; but they who do not acknowledge it in life, and consequently not in faith, cannot be the Lord's, and therefore cannot be 
saved. They are therefore judged according to the acts of their life and according to their thoughts and ends; and when they are judged according to these, they cannot but be condemned; for it is a 
truth that of himself a man does, thinks, and intends nothing but evil, and of himself rushes to hell insofar as he is not withheld therefrom by the Lord. [3] But as regards judgment from truth the case 
is this: The Lord never judges anyone except from good; for He desires to raise all into heaven, however many they may be, and indeed, if it were possible, even to Himself; for the Lord is mercy itself 
and good itself. Mercy itself and good itself can never condemn anyone; but it is the man who condemns himself, because he rejects good. As in the life of the body he had shunned good, so does he 
shun it in the other life; consequently he shuns heaven and the Lord, for the Lord cannot be in anything except good. He is likewise in truth, but not in truth separated from good. That the Lord condemns 
no one, nor judges any to hell, He says in John: </p>
<p>     God sent not His Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. This is the judgment, that the light 
is come into the world, but men loved the darkness rather than the light, because their works were evil (John 3:17, 19). And in the same: </p>
<p>     If any one hear My words, and believe not, I judge him 
not; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world (John 12:47). (See also what has been said on the subject before, n. 223, 245, 592, 696, 1093, 1683, 1874, 2258.) [4] Where Judgment was 
treated of above (n. 2320, 2321), it was shown that all Judgment belongs to the Lord's Divine Human and Holy proceeding, according to His words in John: </p>
<p>     The Father judgeth not anyone, but hath 
given all judgment unto the Son (John 5:22); </p>
<p>and yet it is now said that the Lord does not judge by condemning anyone. From this it is evident what is the nature of the Word in the letter: that unless 
it were understood from another sense, namely, from the internal sense, it would not be comprehended. From the internal sense alone is it manifest how the case is with Judgment. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2335</b></p><p><b>2335.</b>
'For we will spend the night in the street' means that He was willing, so to speak, to judge from truth. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'the street' and from the meaning of 'spending the night'. 
'Street' is mentioned in various places in the Word, and in the internal sense has a similar meaning to 'a way', namely, truth; for a street is a way within a city, as will be clear from the places 
quoted in the next paragraph. That here 'speeding the night' is judging may become clear from the meaning of 'the night'. It has been shown above in <a href="2323.htm">2323</a> that 'the evening' means the penultimate state 
of the Church when faith is starting to be no more. It also means the visitation which takes place prior to judgement. From this it is evident that night which follows is the last state when faith 
is no more, and also when judgement takes place. From this it is plain that in the internal sense 'speeding the night in the street' means judging from truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As for judgement it is twofold, that 
is to say, there is judgement from good and judgement from truth. People who have faith are judged from good, but those who do not have it are judged from truth. The fact that those who have faith 
are judged from good is quite clear in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matthew%2025:%2034-40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matthew 25: 34-40</a>, while those who do not have it are judged from truth, in verses 41-46. Those judged from good are saved since they have accepted good, but those 
judged from truth are condemned because they have rejected good. Good is the Lord's, and those who acknowledge this in life and faith are the Lord's, and are therefore saved; but those who do not acknowledge 
it in life, nor consequently in faith, cannot be the Lord's nor thus be saved. They are judged therefore according to the actions done in their life and according to their thoughts and ends 
in view. And when judged according to these they are inevitably condemned, for the truth is that of himself man can do, think, and intend nothing but evil, and of himself rushes towards hell insofar 
as he is not held back from that place by the Lord. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The situation with regard to judgement from truth is this: The Lord never judges anyone except from good, for His will is to lift all men, however 
many these may be, up to heaven, indeed if it were possible, up to Himself. For the Lord is mercy itself and good itself, and mercy itself and good itself cannot possibly condemn anyone. It is man 
who, in rejecting good, condemns himself. As a person has fled habitually from good during his lifetime, so in the next life he flees from it, and therefore from heaven and the Lord. For the Lord cannot 
be present except within good. He is present in truth as well, but not in truth separated from good. That the Lord does not condemn anyone, that is, does not judge them to hell, He Himself declares 
in John, </p>
<p>God did not send His Son into the world to judge the world but that the world might be saved through Him. This is the judgement, that the light has come into the world, but men preferred 
darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:-17,%2019&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3:-17, 19</a>. </p>
<p>And in the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
If anyone hears My words, yet does not believe, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge 
the world but to save the world. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2012:-47&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 12:-47</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 See in addition what has been said already on these matters in <a href="223.htm">223</a>, <a href="245.htm">245</a>, <a href="592.htm">592</a>, <a href="696.htm">696</a>, <a href="1093.htm">1093</a>, <a href="1683.htm">1683</a>, <a href="1874.htm">1874</a>, <a href="2258.htm">2258</a>. When judgement was dealt with above 
in <a href="2320.htm">2320</a>, <a href="2321.htm">2321</a>, it was shown that all judgement belongs to the Lord's Divine Human and His Holy proceeding, according to the Lord's words in John, </p>
<blockquote>
The Father does not judge anyone, but has given all 
judgement to the Son. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%205:-22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 5:-22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Now however it is said that the Lord does not judge anyone by condemning him. This shows the nature of the Word in the letter - that unless understood from a sense 
other than the letter, namely from the internal sense, it would be unintelligible. The internal sense alone shows what is really involved in judgement. </p>

</p><b>2335.</b>
`Quia in platea pernoctabimus': quod significet quod ex vero quasi vellet judicare, constare potest a significatione `plateae' et a significatione `pernoctare': `platea' in Verbo passim nominatur, (c)et 
in sensu interno simile significat ac `via,' nempe verum, nam platea est via in urbe, ut a locis mox sequentibus constabit: quod `pernoctare' hic sit judicare, constare potest a significatione `noctis': 
ostensum (o)est supra, n. 2323, quod `vespera' significet statum Ecclesiae ante ultimum, cum nulla fides incipit esse, tum quoque visitationem quae praecedit judicium; inde patet quod nox quae 
succedit, sit status ultimus quando nulla fides, tum quod sit judicium; inde liquet quod `in platea pernoctare' in sensu interno sit ex vero judicare.  [2] Quod judicium attinet, est illud duplex, nempe 
ex bono et ex vero; fideles judicantur ex bono, at infideles ex vero; quod fideles ex bono, constat manifeste apud Matthaeum xxv 34-40; et quod infideles ex vero, ibi vers. 41-46; judicari ex bono 
est salvari, quia illud receperunt; at judicari ex vero est damnari, quia bonum rejecerunt; bonum est Domini; hoc qui agnoscunt vita et fide, sunt Domini, quare salvantur, at qui non agnoscunt vita proinde 
non fide, illi non possunt esse Domini, ita nec salvari; judicantur ideo secundum vitae suae acta et secundum cogitationes et fines, et cum secundum haec, non possunt non damnari, nam verum est, 
quod homo ex se non {1} nisi malum faciat, cogitet et intendat, et ex se ruat ad infernum, quantum non inde detinetur a Domino.  [3] Sed ita se habet judicium ex vero: Dominus nusquam aliquem judicat 
quam ex bono, omnes enim, quotcumque sunt, in caelum attollere vult, immo si posset usque ad Semet, est enim Dominus ipsa misericordia ac ipsum bonum; ipsa misericordia et ipsum bonum nusquam potest 
aliquem damnare, sed est homo, quia rejicit bonum, qui se damnat; sicut homo {2} in vita corporis fugerat bonum, ita in altera vita fugit, proinde caelum et Dominum; Dominus enim non nisi quam in bono 
potest esse; in vero quoque est, sed non in vero separato a bono.  Quod Dominus non aliquem damnet, seu judicet ad infernum, Ipse dicit apud Johannem, 	Non misit Deus Filium Suum in mundum, ut judicet 
mundum, sed ut salvetur mundus per Ipsum:... hoc est judicium, quod lux venit in mundum, sed dilexerunt homines magis tenebras quam lucem, erant enim opera eorum mala, iii 17, 19: </p>
<p>et apud eundem, 	Si 
quis Mea audiverit verba, non tamen crediderit, Ego non judico illum; non enim veni ut judicem mundum, sed ut salvem mundum, xii 47; </p>
<p>[4] praeterea videantur quae de his prius, n. 223, 245, 592, 
696, 1093, 1683, 1874, 2258; ubi de judicio supra n. 2320, 2321 actum, ostensum est quod Humano Divino et Sancto procedenti Domini sit omne judicium, secundum Domini verba apud Johannem, 	Non Pater 
judicat quemquam, sed judicium omne dedit Filio, v 22; </p>
<p>et tamen nunc dicitur quod `Dominus non judicet damnando aliquem': inde patet quale Verbum est in littera, quod nisi intelligeretur ex alio sensu, 
nempe ex interno, non comprehenderetur; ex sensu interno solo patet quomodo se habet cum judicio. 	@1 nihil.$ 	@2  nam sicut.$ </p>
