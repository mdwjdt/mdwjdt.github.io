<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6110节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6110.</strong>“饥荒非常严重”表荒凉。这从“饥荒”的含义清楚可知，“饥荒”是指良善和认知或知识的缺乏（参看<a href="1460.htm">1460</a>，<a href="3364.htm">3364</a>，<a href="5277.htm">5277</a>，<a href="5279.htm">5279</a>，<a href="5281.htm">5281</a>，<a href="5300.htm">5300</a>，<a href="5579.htm">5579</a>，<a href="5893.htm">5893</a>节）；因此，“饥荒非常严重”表示荒凉（<a href="5360.htm">5360</a>，<a href="5376.htm">5376</a>，<a href="5415.htm">5415</a>，<a href="5576.htm">5576</a>节）。关于荒凉，要知道，真理与良善，连同有关它们的认知或知识构成那些在天堂之人的属灵生命，因为它们是滋养他们的属天和属灵食物；主每天都将这些食物赐予他们。当他们到了早晨时，就供应良善；到了中午，就供应真理；但到了晚上，他们便缺乏良善与真理，并且这种缺乏一直持续到黎明，然后早晨再次到来。当天使缺乏它们时，他们的欲求仍如此强烈，以致他们对这些事物的渴求，比世人对食物的渴求还大。这种状态由“饥荒”来表示，这是一种荒凉，但不是那些在低地的人所经历的那种荒凉（<a href="698.htm">698</a>，<a href="699.htm">699</a>，<a href="1106.htm">1106</a>-<a href="1113.htm">1113</a>节）。<br />在这个世界上，几乎没有人相信天使天堂对真理和良善，以及有关它们的认知或知识有如此大的渴求。因为一心只想着利益和荣耀，沉溺于世俗享乐的人会惊讶于这类事物竟构成天使的生命；他们会说：“关于良善与真理的认知或知识对我有什么用？它们能给予我什么生命？能给我带来生命和生命快乐的东西是财富、地位和世俗的享乐！”但让说这种话的人知道：这些事物所带来的生命是身体的生命，不是灵魂的生命；前一种生命会与身体一道灭亡，而后一种生命则永远保留。还要让他们知道：人们活在世上时若毫不思想属灵的生命，是极其不明智的。<br />关于荒凉，要进一步知道，它是为引发欲求而存在的，因为良善与真理照着这种欲求而被接受；当获得这种欲求所激发的渴望时，这些渴望便产生满足和幸福感。故在来世，那些经历荒凉的人很快重新焕发活力，实现自己的渴望。那里的所有人都通过这种交替变化而变得越发完美。值得注意的是，自然界中白昼的时间变化（即早晨、中午、晚上、夜间，又一个早晨等）完全代表灵界所发生的变化，唯一不同的是：灵界所发生的变化流入理解力和意愿，并维持那些属于生命的事物；而自然界所发生的变化则流入并维持那些属于身体的事物。<br />更值得注意的是，晚上的阴影和夜间的黑暗并非来自主，而是来自完全属于天使、灵人和世人自己的事物。因为显为太阳的主始终照耀并流入；但源于人自己的东西的邪恶与虚假因存在于世人、灵人或天使里面，故会将他们从主那里转离，如此把他们引入晚上的阴影，把那些陷入邪恶的人引入夜间的黑暗。这就像我们世上的太阳始终照耀并流入，但地球因着绕轴旋转而转离太阳，把自己带入阴影和黑暗之中。<br />自然界之所以发生这些交替变化，是因为自然界是从灵界存在的，因而也是从灵界持续存在的；正因如此，整个自然界是代表主国度的一个舞台（参看<a href="3483.htm">3483</a>，<a href="4939.htm">4939</a>节）。灵界之所以发生这些交替变化，是为了使天堂里的所有人能不断变得越发完美。这类交替变化存在于自然界也是为了这个原因，若非如此，自然界的一切事物就会因干旱而灭亡。<br />然而，要知道，天堂没有黑夜，只有晚上，晚上过后是早晨来临之前的黎明；而地狱则有黑夜。地狱也发生交替变化，但这些交替变化在性质上与天堂的交替变化正好相反。在地狱，早晨是恶欲之热，中午是对虚假的热望，晚上是焦虑，夜间是折磨。然而，在所有这些交替变化中，夜间居于主导地位；其实产生这些交替变化的，纯粹是阴影和黑暗的变化。<br />此外还要知道，在灵界，没有哪两个人身上所发生的变化是一样的，而且那里的交替变化没有划分为固定的时间段，因为它们是产生这些交替变化的状态变化。事实上，在灵界，状态取代了自然界的时间段（<a href="1274.htm">1274</a>，<a href="1382.htm">1382</a>，<a href="2625.htm">2625</a>，<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="2837.htm">2837</a>，<a href="3254.htm">3254</a>，<a href="3356.htm">3356</a>，<a href="4814.htm">4814</a>，<a href="4882.htm">4882</a>，<a href="4901.htm">4901</a>，<a href="4916.htm">4916</a>节）。</p>

Because the famine was very grievous. That this signifies desolation, is evident from the signification of "famine," as being a lack of good and of knowledges (see n. 1460, 3364, 5277, 5279, 5281, 5300, 
5579, 5893); thus a "very grievous famine" denotes desolation (n. 5360, 5376, 5415, 5576). With regard to desolation, be it known that truths and goods and the knowledges thereof make the spiritual 
life of those who are in heaven, for these are the celestial and spiritual foods with which they are nourished. These foods are given them daily by the Lord. When it is morning with them, goods are 
supplied; when it is noon, truths are supplied; but when it is evening, goods and truths are lacking, and this even unto twilight and the return of morning. The angels are then kept in a state of appetite, 
which is of such a nature that they long for these things more than those who are hungry on earth long for food. This state is signified by "famine," and it is a kind of desolation, but not such 
as exists with those who are in the lower earth (n. 698, 699, 1106-1113). [2] Scarcely anyone in this world can believe that the angelic heaven has such an appetite for truths and goods and the knowledges 
of these; for they who are intent on nothing else than gain and glory and indulgence in pleasures, will wonder that such things are a matter of life to the angels, and will say, "What are knowledges 
of good and of truth to me? what have these to do with life? The things which give life and the delight of life are riches, honors, and pleasures." But be it known to them that the life which is 
from these things is the life of the body, and not the life of the soul, and that the former life perishes with the body, but the latter remains to eternity; and that they consult their own evil who 
during their abode in this world think nothing about the spiritual life. [3] As further regards desolation, it is for the sake of inducing appetite, for goods and truths are received in accordance with 
this; and when the desires excited by appetite are obtained, they cause satisfaction and happiness. Wherefore in the other life they who are in desolation are soon afterward refreshed, and attain their 
desires. By means of such alternations are all made perfect. It is worthy of note that the alternations of the day in the natural world-morning, midday, evening, night, and again morning-perfectly 
represent the alternations in the spiritual world, with only this difference: that the alternations of the spiritual world flow into the understanding and the will, and sustain those things which are 
of the life; while the alternations in the natural world flow into those things which are of the body, and sustain them. [4] What is still more worthy of note is that the shades of evening and the 
darkness of night do not come from the Lord, but from things that belong to angels, spirits, and men. For the Lord as a Sun is continually shining and flowing in, but evils and falsities from what is 
one's own, being in men, spirits, and angels, turn and convert them from the Lord, and thus lead them into the shades of evening, and those who are evil into the darkness of night; in like manner as the 
sun of our world is continually shining and inflowing, but the earth by its rotation turns itself away from it, and brings itself into shade and darkness. [5] The reason why these alternations take 
place in the natural world is that the natural world comes forth from the spiritual world, and therefore also subsists from it; and hence it is that universal nature is a theater representative of the 
Lord's kingdom (see n. 3483, 4939). The reason why these alternations exist in the spiritual world is that all who are in heaven may be continually perfected. From this there are such alternations 
also in the natural world, for otherwise all things therein would perish with drought. [6] Yet be it known that in heaven there is no night, but only evening, which is succeeded by the twilight that 
precedes the morning. But in hell there is night. There are alternations there also, but these are opposite to the alternations in heaven; for in hell morning is the heat of cupidities, noon is the itching 
of falsities, evening is anxiety, and night is torment. Yet through all these alternations the night dominates, and it is only the variations of shade and of the darkness of night that present these 
alternations. [7] Be it further known that in the spiritual world the alternations with one person are not like those with another; and also that the alternations there are not distinguished into 
stated times, because it is the variations of state that present them to view; for in place of times in the natural world there are states in the spiritual world (n. 1274, 1382, 2625, 2788, 2837, 3254, 
3356, 4814, 4882, 4901, 4916). </p>

'For the famine was extremely serious' means desolation. This is clear from the meaning of 'famine' as an absence of good and of cognitions, dealt with in <a href="1460.htm">1460</a>, <a href="3364.htm">3364</a>, <a href="5277.htm">5277</a>, <a href="5279.htm">5279</a>, <a href="5281.htm">5281</a>, <a href="5300.htm">5300</a>, <a href="5579.htm">5579</a>, <a href="5893.htm">5893</a>, 
so that 'the famine was extremely serious' is desolation, <a href="5360.htm">5360</a>, <a href="5376.htm">5376</a>, <a href="5415.htm">5415</a>, <a href="5576.htm">5576</a>. As regards desolation, it should be recognized that truths and forms of good, together with cognitions of them, compose 
the spiritual life of those who are in heaven. They are the celestial and spiritual foods that nourish them; and these foods are given them every day by the Lord. When it is morning with them forms 
of good are supplied, and when it is midday truths are supplied; but when evening comes they lack them, and continue to lack them until it is twilight and then morning again. Their yearning when they 
lack them remains so strong that their desire for them is greater than starving people's desire for food on earth. This state is meant by 'the famine' and it is a kind of desolation, though not the 
kind experienced by those on the lower earth, <a href="698.htm">698</a>, <a href="699.htm">699</a>, <a href="1106.htm">1106</a>-<a href="1113.htm">1113</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Scarcely anyone in the world can believe that the angelic heaven can have so great a yearning for truths and forms of good, 
and for cognitions of them. For people whose minds are set on nothing else than gain and glory, and who are given up to worldly pleasures, will be amazed to learn that those things constitute angelic 
life. 'What use they will say 'are cognitions of goodness and truth to me? What life can they give me? The things that bring me life and my life's delight are wealth, position, and worldly pleasures!' 
But let those who speak like this know that the life these things bring is that of the body, not that of the soul, and that the former kind of life perishes along with the body, whereas the latter kind 
remains for ever. Let them also know that people are ill-advised if while in the world they do not give any thought to spiritual life. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Further as regards desolation, it exists on account of 
the yearning; for forms of good and truth are accepted in the measure that they are yearned for, and when the desires created by the yearning are fulfilled they produce feelings of happiness and bliss. 
In the next life therefore those who pass through desolation are refreshed immediately afterwards and realize their desires; everyone there is made more perfect by means of such alternating experiences. 
It is a fact worthy of note that the changing times of day in the natural world - morning, midday, evening, night, and morning again - are wholly representative of the changes that take place in 
the spiritual world, yet with one difference. The changes that occur in the spiritual world have an effect on the understanding and the will, establishing in them the basic elements of life, whereas the 
changes that occur in the world have an effect on and sustain things of the body. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 What is even more noteworthy is the fact that it is not the Lord who brings on the shades of evening and the 
darkness of night but those characteristics of angels, spirits, or men that are entirely their own. For the Lord as the Sun shines and flows in constantly; but because the evils and falsities that spring 
from what is his own are present in a man, spirit, or angel, they turn and direct him away from the Lord. In so doing they bring him into the shades of evening, and lead the wicked into the darkness 
of night. It is similar to the way things are with the sun in our world. It shines and flows in constantly, but the earth by rotating on its axis turns away from the sun and brings itself into shade 
and darkness. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 These features of the natural world come about because the natural world comes into being from the spiritual world and is also kept in being from there, as a consequence of which 
the entire natural system is a theatre representative of the Lord's kingdom, <a href="3483.htm">3483</a>, <a href="4939.htm">4939</a>. The purpose served by the changes that take place in the spiritual world is that all who are in heaven may 
constantly become more perfect. Such changes exist in the natural world for the same reason, for if they did not occur everything there would perish because of drought.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 It should be recognized 
however that in heaven there is no night, only evening, which is followed by the twilight that comes before morning; but in hell there is night. Changes take place there also, but they are of a contrary 
nature to those in heaven. In hell morning is the heat of evil desires, midday is the itch of false ideas, evening is anxiety, and night is torment. But through all these changes night predominates; 
merely variations of shade and darkness are what bring about those changes. In addition to this it should be recognized that in the spiritual world the changes which take place are not the same with 
one person as they are with another, also that the changes there do not divide into regular periods of time because they are variations of state that produce those changes. For instead of the periods 
of time that occur in the natural world there are states in the spiritual world, <a href="1274.htm">1274</a>, <a href="1382.htm">1382</a>, <a href="2625.htm">2625</a>, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="2837.htm">2837</a>, <a href="3254.htm">3254</a>, <a href="3356.htm">3356</a>, <a href="4814.htm">4814</a>, <a href="4916.htm">4916</a>, <a href="4882.htm">4882</a>, <a href="4901.htm">4901</a>. </p>

`Quia gravis fames valde': quod significet desolationem, constat ex significatione `famis' quod sit defectus boni et {1}cognitionum, de qua n. 1460, 3364, 5277, 5279, 5281, 5300, 5579, 5893, ita `gravis 
fames valde' est desolatio, n. 5360, 5376, 5415, 5576.  Quod desolationem attinet, sciendum quod vera et bona et eorum cognitiones faciant vitam spiritualem illorum qui in caelo sunt, sunt illa cibi 
caelestes et spirituales quibus nutriuntur; illi cibi dantur illis quotidie a Domino; cum illis est mane, subministrantur bona, cum meridies subministrantur vera, at cum vespera tunc deficiunt, et 
hoc usque ad diluculum et ad mane iterum; tenentur tunc in appetitione quae talis est {2}ut desiderent illa plus quam famelici cibum in terra; hic status significatur per `famem' et est species desolationis, 
sed non talis qualis est apud illos qui in terra inferiore sunt, n. 698, 699, 1106-1113.  [2] Quod caelum angelicum in tantum appetat vera et bona ac cognitiones eorum, vix aliquis in mundo potest 
credere; qui enim nihil aliud student quam lucris ac gloriae, et indulgent voluptatibus, miraturi quod talia sint vitae angelis, et dicturi, Quid mihi cognitiones boni et veri, quid vitae ex illis? 
 Quae dant vitam et vitae jucundum, sunt divitiae, honores, et voluptates!  At sciant quod vita ex his sit vita corporis, non vita animae, et quod illa, vita cum corpore pereat, haec autem maneat 
in aeternum; et quod sibi male consulant qui nihil de vita spirituali in mundo cogitant.  [3] Quod porro desolationem attinet, est illa propter appetitionem, bona enim et vera recipiuntur secundum illam, 
et desideria quae ex appetitione, cum obtinentur, faciunt faustum et felix; quapropter in altera vita qui in desolatione sunt, mox dein recreantur et desideriis potiuntur; per tales vices perficiuntur 
omnes.  Quod observatu dignum est, quod vices diei in mundo naturali, nempe mane, meridies, vespera, nox et rursus mane, prorsus repraesentent vices in mundo spirituali, solum cum ea differentia 
quod vices mundi spiritualis influant in intellectum et voluntatem, et sistant illa quae sunt vitae; vices autem in mundo naturali influunt in illa quae corporis sunt, et sustentant illa; [4] quod adhuc 
dignius observatu est quod umbrae vesperae et tenebrae noctis non ex Domino veniant sed ex propriis angelorum, spirituum et hominum; Dominis enim ut Sol continue lucet et influit, sed mala et falsa 
ex proprio, quia apud homines, spiritus et angelos, vertunt et convertunt illos a Domino, et sic illos inducunt in umbras vesperae, et malos in tenebras noctis; similiter ac sol mundi nostri, is continue 
lucet et influit, at tellus per circumrotationem se vertit ab illo et se inducit in umbras et tenebras.  [5] Quod haec in mundo naturali existant, est causa quia mundus naturalis existit a mundo 
spirituali, ac inde quoque subsistit; inde est quod universa natura sit theatrum repraesentativum regni Domini, n. 3483, 4939; Quod illae vices sint in mundo spirituali, est ut omnes qui in caelo sunt, 
continue perficiantur; inde etiam tales vices sunt in mundo naturali, nam aliter siccitate perirent omnia ibi.  [6] At sciendum quod in caelo nulla sit nox sed modo vespera, quam excipit diluculum quod 
ante mane; at in inferno est nox; ibi etiam sunt vices sed contrariae vicibus in caelo; ibi mane est aestus cupiditatum, meridies est prurigo falsitatum, vespera est anxietas, et nox est cruciatus; 
at usque per omnes has vices dominatur nox, sunt modo variationes umbrae et tenebrarum noctis quae sistunt illas vices.  [7] Ulterius sciendum quod in mundo spirituali non similes vices sint apud unum 
quae apud alterum, tum quod non vices ibi distinctae sint in stata tempora, sunt enim variationes status quae illas sistunt, nam loco temporum in mundo naturali sunt status in mundo spirituali, n.
