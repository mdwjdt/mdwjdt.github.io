<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10687节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10687</strong>.“他将这约的话写在版上”表圣言，天堂通过圣言与人结合。这从“版”和“约”的含义清楚可知：律法写在其上的“版”是指圣言（参看<a href="9416.htm">9416</a>，<a href="10375.htm">10375</a>，<a href="10376.htm">10376</a>，<a href="10453.htm">10453</a>，<a href="10461.htm">10461</a>节）；“约”是指结合（参看<a href="10632.htm">10632</a>节提到的地方）。之所以表示天堂与人的结合，是因为圣言完全通过对应写成，因而具有这样的性质，它将天堂与人相结合。天堂会意识到圣言的内在意义，而外在意义与内在意义相对应；因此，当一个人阅读圣言时，与此人同在的天使就感知它的属灵意义，也就是内在意义。结果，一种神圣的流注就从天使那里获得，这种流注带来结合；这种性质的圣言被赐下正是为了这个目的。主，因而天堂通过圣言与一个人结合（参看<a href="10375.htm">10375</a>节提到的地方）。圣言通过对应写成，至于这对应是什么，可参看前面提供解释的地方所作的说明。</p>

And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant. That this signifies the Word, through which there is the conjunction of heaven with man, is evident from the signification of "the tables" upon 
which the Law was written, as being the Word (see n. 9416, 10375, 10376, 10453, 10461); and from the signification of a "covenant," as being conjunction (of which at the places cited in n. 10632). The 
reason why the conjunction of heaven with man is signified, is that the Word has been written wholly by correspondences, and consequently is of such a nature as to conjoin heaven with man. For heaven 
is in the internal sense of the Word; and the external sense corresponds to the internal sense; and therefore when the Word is being read by a man, the angels who are with him perceive it in the spiritual 
sense, which is the internal sense; and the result is an influx of what is holy from the angels, which effects the conjunction. It was for this end that a Word of this nature was given. (That by 
means of the Word there is a conjunction of the Lord, thus of heaven, with man, may be seen at the places cited in n. 10375.) What the correspondences are by which the Word was written, has been shown 
in the explications throughout. </p>

'And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant' means the Word, through which heaven is joined to a person. This is clear from the meaning of 'the tablets', on which the Law has been written, 
as the Word, dealt with in <a href="9416.htm">9416</a>, <a href="10375.htm">10375</a>, <a href="10376.htm">10376</a>, <a href="10453.htm">10453</a>, <a href="10461.htm">10461</a>; and from the meaning of 'the covenant' as a joining together, dealt with in the places referred to above in <a href="10632.htm">10632</a>. The reason why the joining 
of heaven to a person is meant is that pure correspondences were used when the Word was written, which makes it such that it joins heaven to a person. Heaven is conscious of the internal sense of 
the Word, to which sense the external sense corresponds; when therefore a person reads the Word the angels present with the person perceive its spiritual meaning, which is the internal sense. As a consequence 
of this a holy influence is received from the angels, which leads to a joining together; and it is with that end in view that a Word such as this has been given. Regarding the truth that the 
Lord, and so heaven, is joined to a person through the Word, see in the places referred to in <a href="10375.htm">10375</a>. As for what the correspondences are of which the written Word consists, this has been shown wherever 
explanations have been provided.  </p>

`Et scripsit super tabulis verba foederis':  quod significet Verbum, per quod conjunctio caeli cum homine, constat ex significatione `tabularum super quibus Lex scripta,' quod sint Verbum, de qua n. 
9416, 10375, 10376, 10453, 10461, et ex significatione `foederis' quod sit conjunctio, de qua supra in locis citatis n. 10632; quod sit conjunctio caeli cum homine, est quia Verbum per meras correspondentias 
conscriptum est, et inde tale ut conjungat caelum cum homine; caelum enim in sensu interno Verbi est, et sensui interno correspondet sensus externus, quare cum legitur ab homine Verbum, angeli 
qui apud hominem sunt percipiunt id in sensu spirituali, qui est sensus internus; inde sanctum ab angelis influit, per quod conjunctio; ob hunc finem tale Verbum datum est.  Quod conjunctio Domini, 
ita caeli, cum homine sit per Verbum, videatur in locis citatis n. 10375; quid sint correspondentiae per quas Verbum conscriptum est, ubivis in explicationibus ostensum est. </p>
