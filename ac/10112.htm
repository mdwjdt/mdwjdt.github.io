<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10112节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10112</strong>.“只是外人不可吃”表那些不承认主的人没有将良善变成他们自己的。这从“外人”或外邦人和“吃”的含义清楚可知。“外人”或外邦人是指那些在教会之外的人（<a href="2049.htm">2049</a>，<a href="2115.htm">2115</a>，<a href="7996.htm">7996</a>节）；那些不承认主的人可以说就在教会之外；在犹太民族当中，那些不承认耶和华是他们的神，或不允许自己在教会的仪式中接受指示的人可以说就在教会之外；那些承认祂，允许自己接受指示的人被称为“寄居的”，他们拥有和本地人一样的权利（<a href="8007.htm">8007</a>，<a href="8013.htm">8013</a>，<a href="9196.htm">9196</a>节）。“吃”是指将良善变成人自己的（<a href="10109.htm">10109</a>节）。不承认主的人之所以没有将良善变成他们自己的，是因为承认一个人的神是宗教信仰的起点，在基督徒当中，承认主是教会的起点；因为没有对主的承认，不可能有传给，随之也不可能有信，因而不可能任何爱。正因如此，基督教会所教导的第一件事就是没有主就没有救恩。因为凡一个人称之为真理并相信的东西，以及凡他称之为良善并热爱的东西，都不能被称为真理和良善，除非它来自神性，因而除非它来自主。事实上，没有人能凭自己相信真理，或实行良善；相反，如众所周知的，一切真理和一切良善都是从上头来的。由此很明显地看出，教会里那些不承认主的人不可能拥有信，因而也不可能拥有对神的任何爱，从而不可能得救。这一点在以色列民族当中由这一命令来代表：他们要承认耶和华是他们的神，他们的敬拜会被接纳并称为圣，那时他们要分别为圣，无论就其内层而言，他们是何品质。因为代表纯粹是外在的，对这个民族来说，仅处于外在就足够了（参看<a href="9320.htm">9320</a>e节所提到的地方）。因此，他们当中那些不承认耶和华，而是承认别神的人，无论如何献上一样的祭物，和其他人一样敬拜，仍被逐出教会，如那些拜巴力和其他神明的人。由此可见，那些生在教会，心里却否认，或说不接受主，无论他们对待他人的方式，或说在道德生活上品质如何的人，在来世将面临怎样的命运。大量经历也使我得以认识到，他们不可能得救；主在约翰福音中也明确教导了这一点：<br />信子的人有永生；不信子的人不得见生命，神的震怒停留在他身上。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.36.htm">3:36</a>）<br />至于教会之外的各个民族，那些出于其宗教信仰而活在某种对邻之仁和某种对人形式的神，宇宙创造者的爱之中的人，在来世被主接纳并得救。因为当被天使教导时，这些人承认主，信祂并爱祂（参看<a href="2589.htm">2589</a>-<a href="2604.htm">2604</a>节）。</p>

And a stranger shall not eat. That this signifies no appropriation of good with those who do not acknowledge the Lord, is evident from the signification of "a stranger," and "a foreigner," as being those 
who are outside the church (n. 2049, 2115, 7996); and those are said to be outside the church who do not acknowledge the Lord. Among the Israelitish nation those were said to be outside the church 
who did not acknowledge Jehovah as their God, and did not suffer themselves to be instructed in the rituals of the church. Those who acknowledged, and suffered themselves to be instructed, were called 
"sojourners," who had the same rights as the natives (n. 8007, 8013, 9196). And from the signification of "eating," as being the appropriation of good (n. 10109). The reason why there is no appropriation 
of good with those who do not acknowledge the Lord, is because to acknowledge one's God is the first of religion, and with Christians to acknowledge the Lord is the first of the church; for without 
acknowledgment there is no communication, consequently no faith, thus no love. Consequently the first of doctrine in the Christian Church is that without the Lord there is no salvation. For whatever 
a man calls true, and believes, and whatever he calls good, and loves, cannot be called true and good unless it is from the Divine, thus unless it is from the Lord; for it is also known that of himself 
a man cannot believe and do what is good; but that all truth and all good come from above. Thus it is very plain that those within the Church who do not acknowledge the Lord, cannot have faith, 
thus neither can they have love to God, nor consequently can they be saved. This was represented among the Israelitish nation by the injunction that they were to acknowledge Jehovah as their God, and 
their worship would be accepted and called holy, and they would then be sanctified, whatever was their quality as to the interiors; for the representatives were merely external, and with that nation it 
was sufficient to be in externals (see the places cited in n. 9320). Therefore those of them who did not acknowledge Jehovah, but another God, no matter how they sacrificed and worshiped in like manner 
as the rest, were nevertheless rejected from the church; as for instance those who worshiped Baal, and other gods. From this can be seen what is the lot of those in the other life who have been born 
within the church and yet at heart deny the Lord, whatever may be their quality as to moral life. By much experience also it has been given to know that they cannot be saved; which the Lord also teaches 
openly in John: </p>
<p>     He that believeth in the Son hath eternal life, but he that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him (John 3:36). But with regard to the 
nations outside the church, those who have lived from their religion in some kind of charity toward their neighbor, and in some kind of love to God the Creator of the universe under a human form, are 
in the other life accepted by the Lord and are saved; for when instructed by angels these acknowledge the Lord, and believe in Him, and love Him (see n. 2589-2604). </p>

'And a stranger shall not eat them' means no making of good their own by those who do not acknowledge the Lord. This is clear from the meaning of 'a stranger' or a foreigner as one who is outside the 
Church, dealt with in <a href="2049.htm">2049</a>, <a href="2115.htm">2115</a>, <a href="7996.htm">7996</a>, and they are said to be outside the Church who do not acknowledge the Lord (among the Jewish nation those who did not acknowledge Jehovah as their God or allow 
themselves to receive instruction in the ritual observances of the Church [were called 'outsiders']; those who did acknowledge Him and allow themselves to receive instruction were called 'sojourners', 
who had the same rights as natives, see <a href="8007.htm">8007</a>, <a href="8013.htm">8013</a>, <a href="9196.htm">9196</a>); and from the meaning of 'eating' as making good one's own, dealt with in <a href="10109.htm">10109</a>. The reason why good is not made their own by people who do 
not acknowledge the Lord is that acknowledging one's God is the starting point of religion, and among Christians acknowledging the Lord is the starting point of the Church; for without acknowledgement 
of Him there can be no transmission of anything from Him, nor consequently any faith, nor thus any love. So it is that the chief thing the Christian Church teaches is that without the Lord there is no 
salvation. For whatever a person calls true and believes and whatever he calls good and loves cannot be said to be true or good unless it comes from the Divine, and so unless it comes from the Lord. 
For no one left to himself is able to believe what is true or do what is good; rather, as is also well known, everything true and everything good comes from above. From this it is plainly evident that 
people within the Church who do not acknowledge the Lord cannot possess faith, nor thus any love to God, and therefore cannot be saved. This was represented among the Israelite nation by their acknowledgement 
of Jehovah as their God, by the acceptance of their worship and its being called holy, and by their being sanctified then, regardless of what they were like inwardly. For things of a representative 
nature were no more than outward forms, and with that nation an interest in these alone was sufficient, see the places referred to in <a href="9320.htm">9320</a>(end). Those of them therefore who did not acknowledge 
Jehovah but some other God, however much they offered the same kinds of sacrifice and worshipped in the same kinds of ways, were nevertheless banished from the Church, such as those who honoured baal 
and other gods. From this it may be recognized what kind of fate in the next life awaits those who have been born within the Church and yet at heart fail to accept the Lord, whatever the ways in which 
they have behaved towards others. Much experience as well has led me to see that they cannot be saved, as also the Lord teaches explicitly in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
He who believes in the Son has eternal life; 
but he who does not believe in the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God rests upon him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:36&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3:36</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>As regards nations outside the Church however, those who, true to their religion, have led 
lives in which some kind of charity towards their neighbour has figured, and some kind of love to God the Creator of the universe in a human form, are accepted in the next life by the Lord and saved. 
For after receiving instruction from angels they acknowledge the Lord, believe in Him, and love Him, see <a href="2589.htm">2589</a>-<a href="2604.htm">2604</a>.  </p>

`Et alienus non comedet': quod significet nullam appropriationem boni apud illos qui non agnoscunt Dominum, constat ex significatione `alieni' et alienigenae, quod sit qui extra Ecclesiam, de qua n. 
2049, 2115, 7996, et illi dicuntur esse extra Ecclesiam qui non agnoscunt Dominum; apud gentem Israeliticam qui non agnoverunt Jehovam pro suo Deo, ac se instrui passi sunt in ritualibus Ecclesiae; qui 
agnoverunt et se instrui passi sunt {1} vocabantur peregrini, quibus idem jus fuit cum indigenis, videatur n. 8007, 8013, 9196; et ex significatione `comedere' quod sit appropriatio boni, de qua n. 
10,109; quod non sit appropriatio boni apud illos qui non agnoscunt Dominum, est quia agnoscere Deum suum est primum religionis, et apud Christianos agnoscere Dominum est primum Ecclesiae, nam absque 
agnitione non datur communicatio, consequenter nec {2} fides, ita nec amor; inde primarium doctrinae in Ecclesia Christiana est quod absque Domino nulla sit salus; quicquid enim homo dicit verum et credit, 
et quicquid dicit bonum et amat, non dici potest verum et bonum nisi sit a Divino, ita nisi sit a Domino, nam quod homo a semet non verum possit credere ac bonum facere, sed quod omne verum et 
omne bonum veniat desuper etiam notum est {3}; inde manifeste patet quod qui non agnoscunt Dominum intra Ecclesiam, non fidem habere possint, ita nec amorem in Deum, proinde non salvari.  Hoc repraesentabatur 
apud gentem Israeliticam per quod agnoscerent Jehovam pro Deo suo, (c)ac quod cultus eorum acceptaretur (c)et diceretur sanctus, ac illi tunc sanctificati, qualescumque fuerunt quoad interiora; 
repraesentativa enim solum erant {4} externa, (c)ac apud illam gentem satis fuit esse in externis, (o)videantur citata n. 9320 fin.; qui itaque {5} eorum non agnoverunt Jehovam sed alium Deum, utcumque 
similiter sacrificabant ac similiter colebant, usque rejecti sunt ex Ecclesia, sicut qui balem et alios deos.  Inde constare potest qualis sors illorum est in altera vita qui intra Ecclesiam nati 
sunt et usque negant corde Dominum, qualescumque sint in morali vita; per plurem experientiam etiam scire datum est quod illi non salvari possint, (m)quod etiam Dominus aperte docet apud Johannem,  
    	Qui credit in Filium, habet vitam aeternam, qui vero non credit Filio, non videbit vitam, sed ira Dei manet super illo, iii 36.(n) Quod autem gentes extra Ecclesiam attinet qui ex religioso suo 
in aliqua specie charitatis erga proximum (o)suum vixerunt, et in aliqua specie amoris in Deum Creatorem universi sub forma Humana, {6} in altera vita acceptantur a Domino et salvantur, nam illi cum instructi 
ab angelis, agnoscunt Dominum, et credunt in Ipsum, et amant Ipsum, videatur n. 2589-2604. @1 qui apud gentem Israeliticam agnoverant Jehovam, ac se instrui passi sunt in veris et bonis Ecclesiae,
