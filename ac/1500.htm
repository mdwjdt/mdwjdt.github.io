<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1500.</strong>“他妻子”表它们也离开了与属天之物结合的真理，也就是说，记忆的知识离开了这些真理。这从“妻子”的含义，以及刚才所述清楚可知，“妻子”表与属天之物结合的真理。空虚的记忆知识离开属天之物，如同空虚的观念习惯于离开智慧。它们就象外壳或鳞片那样自行脱落。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1500.</strong> His wife means that the same thing happened to the truth that was united with heavenly traits; that is to say, the facts he knew deserted this truth. This can be seen from the symbolism of a wife as truth united to what is heavenly (mentioned above) and also from the remarks just made. Useless facts leave when heavenly concepts arrive, just as foolish ones do when wisdom arrives. They are like shells or scales that slough off spontaneously. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1500</b></p><p><b>1500.</b>
And his wife. That this signifies that they left the truths that were conjoined with celestial things, that is to say, that memory-knowledges left them, is evident from the signification of "wife," as 
being truth conjoined with what is celestial (spoken of above), and also from what has just been said. Empty memory-knowledges leave celestial things, as vain things are wont to leave wisdom; they are 
as crusts and scales that separate themselves of their own accord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1500</b></p><p><b>1500.</b>
That 'his wife' means that they - that is, facts - also went away from the truths that were joined to celestial things is clear from the meaning of 'wife' as truth joined to the celestial, dealt with 
above, and also from what has just been stated. Empty facts go away from celestial things, as vain notions are accustomed to do from wisdom. They are like shells or scales that fall away of their own accord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1500</b>
</p><b>1500.</b>
Quod 'uxorem illius' significet quod vera caelestibus conjuncta, nempe quod scientifica reliquerint illa, constat ex significatione 'uxoris' quod sit verum conjunctum caelesti, de qua supra; ut et ex 
illis quae modo dicta sunt; inania scientifica relinquunt caelestia, sicut solent vana sapientum; sunt quasi crustacea seu squamosa quae se sponte separant. </p>
