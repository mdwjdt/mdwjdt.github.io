Verses 54, 55. And Jacob sacrificed a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brethren to eat bread; and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mountain. And in the morning Laban arose early, 
and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them; and Laban departed and returned to his place. "And Jacob sacrificed a sacrifice in the mountain," signifies worship from the good of love; 
"and called his brethren to eat bread," signifies the appropriation of good from the Lord's Divine natural; "and they did eat bread," signifies the effect; "and tarried all night in the mountain," signifies 
tranquillity; "and in the morning Laban arose early," signifies the enlightenment of this good from the Lord's Divine natural; "and kissed his sons and his daughters," signifies the acknowledgment 
of these truths and of the affections of the same; "and blessed them," signifies the consequent joy; "and Laban departed and returned to his place" signifies the end of the representation by Laban. </p>

Verses 54, 55 And Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain, and called his brothers to eat bread; and they ate bread and stayed the night in the mountain. And in the morning Laban rose up early, and 
kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them; and Laban went and returned to his place. </p>
<p>'Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain' means worship founded on good that stems from love. 'And 
called his brothers to eat bread' means [an invitation] to make the good from the Lord's Divine Natural their own. 'And they ate bread' means the achievement of this. 'And stayed the night in the mountain' 
means serenity. 'And in the morning Laban rose up early' means the enlightenment of that good by the Lord's Divine Natural. 'And kissed his sons and his daughters' means the acknowledgement of those 
truths and of affections for them. 'And blessed them' means the resulting joy. 'And Laban went and returned to his place' means the end of the representation by means of Laban. </p>

[Vers. 54, 55.] Et sacrificavit Jacob sacrificium in monte, et locavit fratres suos ad comedendum panem, et comederunt panem, et pernoctaverunt in monte.  Et mane surrexit Laban in matutino, et osculatus 
filios suos, et filias suas, et benedixit illis, et ivit, et reversus Laban ad locum suum. `Sacrificavit Jacob sacrificium in monte' significat cultum ex bono amoris: `et vocavit fratres suos ad 
comedendum panem' significat appropriationem boni a Domini Divino Naturali: `et comederunt panem' significat effectum: `et pernoctaverunt in monte' significat tranquillitatem: `et mane surrexit 
Laban in matutino' significat illustrationem illius boni a Divino Naturali Domini: `et osculatus filios suos, et filias suas' significat agnitionem veritatum illarum et affectionum earundem: `et 
benedixit illis significat gaudium inde: `et ivit, et reversus Laban ad locum suum' significat finem repraesentationis per Labanem. </p>
