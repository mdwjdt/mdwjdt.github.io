<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4075节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4075.</strong>“但我父亲的神向来与我同在”表祂所拥有的一切皆来自神性。这从以下事实清楚可知：当论及主时，“祂父亲的神”是指祂所拥有的神性；“与我同在”表示祂所拥有的一切皆来自神性。当主将祂自己里面的人身变成神性时，祂也就拥有了自己周围灵人与天使的社群；因为一切事照次序实现是祂的旨意。不过，祂为自己选择的是能提供服务的那类社群，并按祂的美意改变他们。然而，祂根本不从它们那里取任何良善或真理，并将其运用于自己身上，只从神性取得。祂还以这种方式将天堂和地狱恢复秩序，并且逐步恢复，直到祂完全荣耀祂自己。灵人和天使的社群能提供服务，然而主并不从他们那里取任何事物，这一点可举例来说明。<br />诸如以为良善源于他们自己，由此将功德置于善行的那类社群所起的作用是：将主引入关于这类良善的记忆知识，并从这种记忆知识引入关于没有功德、诸如源于神性的那类良善的智慧。这知识和源于它的智慧并非来源于这些社群，只是通过他们获得而已。另举一例：自以为相当有智慧，却又推理良善与真理的真实可靠性的社群，基本上属于那些属灵的社群。他们所起的作用是：将主引入关于这类人的知识，并且相对于其他人，他们住在何等大的阴暗中，若非主怜悯他们，他们必要灭亡。他们还有助于将祂引入来自神性的更多事物，这些事物并非来源于这些社群，而是通过他们获得。<br />再举一例：有些社群爱神，但却以为他们只有关注无限，并敬拜向他们隐藏起来的那一位神，才能爱祂。而事实上，他们无法如此行，除非他们通过某种概念使那无限变得有限，或在他们自己里面，通过有限的理性概念，将这位隐藏的神形像化，变得可见。否则，这就像是仰望黑暗，用爱拥抱笼罩在那黑暗里的东西，从而引发许多由各人自己的想法所产生的稀奇古怪、一知半解的观念。这类社群也能起到作用，即：将祂引入关于这些人的内层性质的知识和他们爱之性质的知识，以及对他们的怜悯，因为他们也无法得救，除非主人的人身也变成他们所仰望的神性。这种智慧并非出自这些社群，而通过他们出自神性。人所能举的其它例子也是同样的情形。由此可见，“没有任何事物从‘拉班’所表示的良善那里取得，主所拥有的一切皆来自神性，即来自祂自己”这样的说法是什么意思。</p>

And the God of my father hath been with me. That this signifies that all things which He had were from the Divine, is evident from the fact that the "God of His father," when predicated of the Lord, 
is the Divine which He had; and that "hath been with me," signifies that all things which He had were from the Divine. When the Lord made the human in Himself Divine, He too had around Him societies of 
spirits and angels, for He willed that all things should be done according to order; but He summoned to Himself such as might be of service, and changed them at His good pleasure; yet He did not take 
from them and apply to Himself anything of good and truth, but only from the Divine. In this manner He also reduced into order both heaven and hell, and this by successive steps, until He had fully 
glorified Himself. That the societies of spirits and angels were capable of being of use, and yet that He took nothing from them, may be illustrated by examples. [2] The societies which are such as to 
believe that good is from themselves, and thereby to place merit in goods, were of service to Him by introducing Him into memory-knowledge concerning such good, and thence into wisdom concerning good 
that is devoid of self-merit, such as is that which is from the Divine. This knowledge and the derivative wisdom were not from those societies, but were obtained by their means. Take another example: 
the societies which believe themselves to be very wise, and yet reason about good and truth, and about everything as to whether it is so, are for the most part societies of the spiritual; and these 
societies were of service to Him by introducing Him into knowledge in regard to such persons, and how greatly they are relatively in shade, and that unless the Lord should have mercy on them they would 
perish; and also into knowledge of many more things from the Divine, which were not from these societies, but by means of them.  [3] Take as yet another example the societies which are in love to God, 
and believe that if they look to the Infinite, and worship a hidden God, they can be in love to Him; when yet they are not so, unless by some idea they make that Infinite finite, or present the hidden 
God as visible within themselves by finite intellectual ideas; for otherwise it would be a looking into thick darkness, and embracing with love that which is therein, whence there would arise many 
fanciful and undigested conceits, in accordance with each man's ideas. Such societies were also of service to Him by introducing Him into a knowledge of the quality of their interiors, and also of the 
quality of their love, and likewise into pity that they too could not be saved unless the Lord's human should become also Divine, for them to look upon. This wisdom was not from these societies, but 
by their means from the Divine. The case was the same with everything else. From this it is evident how the case stands with the matter now under consideration-that nothing was taken from the good signified 
by "Laban," but that all things which the Lord had were from the Divine, that is, from Himself. </p>

'And the God of my father has been with me' means that the Divine was the author of all that He had. This is clear from the fact that when used in reference to the Lord 'the God of His father' means 
the Divine which was His, and that 'has been with me' means the author of all that He had. When the Lord made the Human within Himself Divine, He too had communities of spirits and angels around Him; 
for it was His will that everything should be accomplished in keeping with order. But He chose for Himself the kind of communities that would be of service, and changed them as seemed good to Him. Yet 
He did not take any good or truth at all from them and apply it to Himself, but only from the Divine. And by acting in this way He also restored to order both heaven and hell; He restored them step by 
step until He had glorified Himself completely. The fact that these communities of spirits and angels were able to be of service and that the Lord took nothing from them can be shown from examples: </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
Communities which are such that they believe good to originate in themselves, and as a consequence place merit in good deeds, served the use of introducing Him to a knowledge of such good, and 
from this knowledge to wisdom regarding good that is devoid of merit, such as originates in the Divine. That knowledge and wisdom deriving from it did not originate in those communities but was obtained 
through them. Take as another example communities which believe themselves to be rather wise, and yet reason about the validity of every aspect of good and truth. Such communities belong in the main 
to those which are spiritual. They served the use of introducing Him to a knowledge of those people and to how far they dwelt in shade in comparison with others, and that unless the Divine took pity 
on them they would perish. They also served to introduce Him to further things from the Divine which did not originate in those communities but were obtained through them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Take as yet another 
example communities which love God but believe that if they look to the Infinite, and so worship a God who is hidden from them, they are able to love Him. They cannot in fact do so unless by means of 
some idea or other they make that Infinite finite, or else within themselves visualize the hidden God by means of finite intellectual concepts. Otherwise it would be looking into thick darkness and embracing 
with love that which is enveloped in that darkness, and so would lead to further ill-formed and sketchy notions resulting from each person's own ideas. Such communities likewise served the use 
of introducing Him to a knowledge of the nature of the interior features of those people, and also to a knowledge of the nature of their love, as well as to a sense of pity for them, in that they could 
not be saved unless the Lord's Human was made Divine also for them to look to. This wisdom did not come from those communities but through them from the Divine. The same is so with any other examples 
that one might take. From all this one may see what is implied by the statement that nothing was taken from the good meant by 'Laban', but that the Divine - that is, the Lord Himself - was the author 
of everything He had. </p>

`Et Deus patris mei fuit cum me': quod significet quod a Divino omnia quae sibi, constat ex eo quod `Deus patris' cum praedicatur de Domino, sit Divinum quod Ipsi; et quod `fuit cum me' sit quod 
inde omnia quae Sibi.  Dominus cum Humanum in Se Divinum fecit, etiam societates spirituum et angelorum circum Se habuit, nam voluit ut secundum ordinem omnia fierent; sed Sibi Ipsi adscivit quales 
inservirent, et sicut beneplacuit {1}, mutavit illas ; at ex illis nihil boni et veri sumpsit et Sibi applicuit sed ex Divino {2}, sic etiam in ordinem redegit et caelum et infernum, et hoc successive 
usque dum Se plene glorificavit: quod societates spirituum et angelorum inservire potuerint usui et usque nihil ab illis desumpserit, illustrari potest ab exemplis: [2] societates quae tales sunt 
ut credant bonum esse a se, et inde in bonis meritum ponunt, inserviverant usui ad introducendum Se in scientiam de tali bono, et inde in sapientiam de bono absque merito quale est quod ex Divino; 
illa scientia et inde sapientia non fuit ex illis societatibus, sed per illas. Sint quoque pro exemplo societates quae multum se sapere credunt, et tamen de bono et vero ratiocinantur et de singulis 
num ita sit; tales societates sunt pleraeque spiritualium; inserviverant usui ad introducendum Se in scientiam de illis et quantum in umbra sunt respective, et nisi Divinum misereretur eorum 
quod perirent, et in plura quae ex Divino; quae non fuerunt ex illis sed per illas.  [3] Sint adhuc pro exemplo societates quae in amore in Deum sunt, et credunt si infinitum intuentur, et absconditum 
{3} Deum colunt {4}, quod in amore in Ipsum possint esse, cum tamen non sunt nisi infinitum (c)illud aliqua idea finitum faciant, aut absconditum Deum visibilem apud se per ideas intellectuales 
finitas sistant, quia alioquin foret intueri in caliginem, et amore amplecti {5} id quod ibi, ita plura inconcinna et incondita secundum cujusvis ideas; </p>
<p>tales quoque inserviverant usui ad introducendum 
in scientiam de interioribus illorum qualia essent {6}, tum de amore illorum qualis, et quoque in miserationem, et quod nec salvari possent nisi Humanum Domini quoque Divinum fieret, in quod 
intuerentur; haec sapientia nec fuit ex illis sed per illas ex Divino: similiter se habet in reliquis: exinde patet quomodo se habet cum hoc quod a bono per `Labanem' significato nihil desumptum sit, 
sed quod omnia quae Domino, a Divino fuerint, hoc est, ab Ipso.      @1 i Ipsi$      @2 i suo$      @3 i sic$      @4 colant$      @5 complecti$      @6 sunt$ </p>
