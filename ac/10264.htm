<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10264节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10264</strong>.“就是合成的香膏”表存在于主之人身的每一个部分里面。这从“香膏”的含义清楚可知，“香膏”当论及膏油时（膏油表示主的神性之爱的神性良善的一个代表），是指在祂的人身里面的神性之物。“合成的香膏”之所以具有这种含义，是因为上面提到的一切香料或有香味的物质，即最好的没药、香肉桂、香菖蒲和桂皮，是一种“合成的香膏”。此外，在原文，香味一般由这个词（即香料或芳香）来表示；但译者却由于膏抹而称它为“香膏”。<br />“合成的香料”表示存在于主之人身的每一个部分里面，是因为所表示的是在这人身的每个层面上的真理，连同对它们的感知和情感。也就是说，“没药”表示在它的最低层上的真理，也就是感官的真理，以及对它的感知（参看<a href="10252.htm">10252</a>节）；“香肉桂”表示属世人或外在人的内层真理，以及对它的感知和情感（参看<a href="10254.htm">10254</a>节）；“香菖蒲”表示属于内在人的甚至更内层的真理，以及对它的感知和情感（<a href="10256.htm">10256</a>节）；“桂皮”表示至内层的真理，以及对它的感知和情感（<a href="10258.htm">10258</a>节）。因此，这些香料表示每个层面上的人身或整个人身，因为住在人里面的一切事物，无一例外，都与真理，与对它们的感知和情感有某种关系；事实上，这些构成他的实际生命。<br />人们能够知道，没有对真理和良善的感知和情感，一个人就不是一个人；因为人所思想的一切，无一例外，都与真理和对它们的感知，与良善和对它们的情感有某种关系。人的思维和情感不是别的；因为人拥有理解的能力和意愿的能力，理解力是由对真理的感知构成的，意愿是由对良善的情感构成的。整个人从头顶到脚跟，无论里面还是外面，仅仅是由他自己的真理或虚假，和他自己的良善或邪恶构成的，身体则是它们的外在形式。不过，这是一个世人尚不知晓的奥秘。<br />由此清楚可知，“合成的香料”或“合成的香膏”（要把它们理解为真理的所有层级，从最末和最低层到至内层，因而表示整体上的真理）表示人里面或构成人的一切事物，无一例外。因此，当香膏论及主时，它表示主之人身的每一个部分。<br />经上说“你要把它制成膏油，就是照着香膏配制师的手工合成的香膏”，因为“膏油”表示自成孕时就在主里面的神性之爱的神性良善本身（<a href="9954.htm">9954</a>，<a href="10011.htm">10011</a>，<a href="10019.htm">10019</a>节）；“合成的香膏”表示它存在于主之人身的每一个部分里面；“香膏配制师（或制膏者）的手工”表示由于神性本身的流注和运作。因为唯独在其神性人身方面的主是耶和华的受受膏者（<a href="9954.htm">9954</a>节）。</p>

An ointment of ointment. That this signifies in each and all things of His Human, is evident from the signification of "ointment," when said of the oil of anointing, by which is signified a representative 
of the Divine good of the Lord's Divine Human, as being what is Divine in each and all things of His Human. That this is signified by "an ointment of ointment" is because all the spices mentioned 
above, which were best myrrh, aromatic cinnamon, aromatic calamus, and cassia, are meant by the "ointment of ointment." Moreover, in the original tongue what is aromatic in general is meant by this 
word ("spice," or "aromatic"); but the translators call it "ointment" from anointing.  [2] That "aromatic of aromatic" signifies in each and all things of the Lord's Human, is because there are signified 
the truths of the whole human, together with their perceptions and affections, namely, the ultimate truth of the sensuous mind, together with the perception of it, which is signified by "myrrh" (see 
n. 10252); the interior truth of the natural or external man, together with the perception and the affection of it, which is signified by "aromatic cinnamon" (see n. 10254); truth still more interior 
which is of the internal man, together with the perception and the affection of it, which is signified by "aromatic calamus" (n. 10256); and inmost truth, together with the perception and the affection 
of it, which is signified by "cassia" (n. 10258). Thus the whole human is signified by these, for each and all things in man bear relation to truths and their perceptions and affections, because 
these make man's life. [3] For it can be known that without the perception and affection of truth and good, a man is not a man, seeing that each and all things that he thinks bear relation to truths 
and their perceptions, and to goods and their affections. The thoughts and affections of man are nothing else; for man has an understanding and a will; and the understanding is made out of the perception 
of truth; and the will out of the affection of good. That the whole man from head to heel, both within and without, is nothing but his own truth or falsity, and his own good or evil, and that the 
body is the external form of these, is a secret which has not as yet been known in the world. [4] From all this it can now be seen that by "aromatic of aromatic," or "ointment of ointment," by which 
are understood all truths from the ultimate to the inmost, thus truths in their whole complex, are signified each and all things in man, or from which he is man; consequently when this "aromatic" is 
predicated of the Lord, that it signifies each and all things of His Human.  [5] It is said, "thou shalt make it an oil of anointing, an aromatic of aromatic, the work of a perfumer," because the "oil 
of anointing" signifies the Divine good itself of the Divine love which was in the Lord from conception (n. 9954, 10011, 10019); "an aromatic of aromatic" signifies this in each and all things of His 
Human; and "the work of a perfumer," or of a "maker of ointment," signifies from the influx and operation of the Divine Itself; for the Lord alone in respect to His Human was the anointed of Jehovah 
(n. 9954). </p>

'A compounded ointment' means present within every single part of His Human. This is clear from the meaning of 'ointment' - when it refers to 'an anointing oil', by which a representative sign of the 
Divine Good of the Lord's Divine Love is meant - as what is Divine within every single part of His Human. 'A compounded ointment' has this meaning because all the sweet-smelling substances which were 
mentioned above, namely the best myrrh, sweet-smelling cinnamon, sweet-smelling calamus, and cassia, should be understood by a compounded ointment. Furthermore in the original language a sweet smell 
in general is meant by the word that is used; but translators render it 'ointment', from 'anointing'.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 'A compounded perfume'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> means present within every single part of the Lord's Human, because 
truths on every level of that Human, and the accompanying perceptions and affections, are meant. That is to say, truth on its lowest level, which is that of the senses, and the perception that accompanies 
it, is meant by 'myrrh', <a href="10252.htm">10252</a>; the interior truth of the natural or external man, and the perception and affection that accompany it, by 'sweet-smelling cinnamon', <a href="10254.htm">10254</a>; truth even more interior, 
belonging to the internal man, and the perception and affection that accompany it, by 'sweet-smelling calamus', <a href="10256.htm">10256</a>; and inmost truth, and the perception and affection that accompany it, by 'cassia', <a href="10258.htm">10258</a>. Thus the Human at every level is meant by these spices, for everything without exception that resides within the human being has some connection with truths and with perceptions of and affections 
for them; for these compose his actual life.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 It may be known that a human being without any perception of or affection for truth and good is not a human being; for everything without 
exception that a human being thinks about has some connection with truths and perceptions of them, and with forms of good and affections for them. Human thoughts and affections are nothing else; for 
the human being possesses the power of understanding and the power of will, the understanding being composed of the perception of truth, and the will of the affection for good. The whole human being from 
head to toe, inwardly and outwardly, consists of nothing other than truth or falsity that is his, and of good or evil that is his, the body being their outward form. But this is an arcanum unknown 
in the world as yet.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 From all this it now becomes clear that 'a compounded perfume' or 'a compounded ointment' - by which all degrees of truth from last and lowest to inmost, thus truths in their 
complete entirety, should be understood - means everything without exception within the human being or of which the human being consists. Consequently when that sweet-smelling ointment is spoken 
of in reference to the Lord, every single part of His Human is meant.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 It says, 'You shall make it an anointing oil, a compounded perfume, the work of a perfumer', because 'an anointing oil' means 
the actual Divine Good of Divine Love, which was within the Lord from conception, <a href="9954.htm">9954</a>, <a href="10011.htm">10011</a>, <a href="10019.htm">10019</a>; 'a compounded perfume' means its presence within every single part of His Human; and 'the work 
of a perfumer (or ointment-maker)' means as a result of the influx and operation of Divinity itself. For the Lord alone as to His Divine Human was Jehovah's Anointed, see <a href="9954.htm">9954</a>.

`Unguentum unguenti': quod significet in omnibus et singulis Humani Ipsius, constat ex significatione `unguenti' cum de oleo unctionis, per quod significatur repraesentativum Divini Boni Divini {1}Amoris 
Domini, quod sit Divinum in omnibus et singulis Humani Ipsius; quod hoc per `unguentum unguenti' significetur, est quia omnia aromatica quae supra memorata sunt, quae fuerunt myrrha optima, cinnamomum 
aromaticum, calamus aromaticus, et casia, per unguentum unguenti intelliguntur; etiam in lingua originali aromaticum in genere per vocem illam significatur; sed interpretes dicunt unguentum ex 
unctione. 	[2] Quod `aromaticum aromatici' significet in omnibus et singulis Humani Domini, est quia vera totius Humani cum eorum perceptionibus et affectionibus significantur,nempe verum ultimum quod 
sensualis, cum ejus perceptione per myrram, n. 10,252, verum interius naturalis seu externi hominis, cum ejus perceptione et affectione, per cinnamomum aromaticum, n. 10,254, verum adhuc interius, quod 
est interni hominis, cum ejus perceptione et affectione, per calamum {2}aromaticum, n. 10,256, et verum intimum cum ejus perceptione et affectione per casiam, n. 10,258; ita per illa totum Humanum, 
nam omnia et singula {3}apud hominem se referunt ad vera et {4} eorum perceptiones et affectiones, faciunt enim {5} vitam ejus; notum enim esse potest quod homo absque [3] perceptione et affectione 
veri et boni non sit homo, nam omnia et singula quae cogitat se referunt ad vera et eorum perceptiones, et ad bona et eorum affectiones; cogitationes et affectiones hominis non aliud sunt; est enim homini 
intellectuale et est voluntarium, intellectuale constituitur ex perceptione veri, et voluntarium ex affectione boni; (m)quod totus homo a capite ad calcem, interius et exterius, non sit nisi quam 
suum verum aut falsum, (c)ac suum bonum aut malum, et quod corpus sit eorum forma externa, est arcanum quod nondum in orbe notum est.(n) 	[4] {6}Ex his nunc constare potest quod per `aromaticum (d)aromatici,' 
seu unguentum unguenti, per quod intelliguntur omnia vera ab ultimo ad intimum, ita vera in toto complexu, significentur omnia et singula apud hominem, seu ex quibus homo; proinde cum aromaticum 
illud dicitur de Domino, quod significet omnia et singula Humani Ipsius. 	[5] Dicitur, `Facies illud oleum unctionis, aromaticum aromatici, opus aromatarii' quoniam `oleum' unctionis significat 
ipsum Divinum Bonum Divini Amoris, quod fuit in Domino ex conceptione, n. 9954, 10,011, 10,019; `aromaticum aromatici' significat id in omnibus et singulis Humani Ipsius, et `opus aromatarii' seu unguentarii
