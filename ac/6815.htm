<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6815节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6815.</strong>我被允许将这个问题引入他们的脑海，即：他们是否愿意运用自己的知识履行某种功用；因为仅以知识为快乐是不够的；知识要关注功用，功用必是目的。我告诉他们说，唯独知识对他们没有用，只对他们愿意与之共享知识的其他人有用；对于渴望变得智慧的人来说，只停留在获取知识上绝对不合适，因为知识仅仅是辅助因素，不过是达到一个目的的手段；旨在服务于寻求必属于生活的功用。可他们回答说，他们以知识为快乐，知识对他们来说就是功用。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6815</b></p><p><b>6815.</b>
I was allowed to insinuate the question whether they did not desire to perform some use by virtue of their knowledges; because it is not sufficient to be delighted with knowledges, seeing that knowledges 
look to uses, and uses must be the ends. From knowledges alone, I told them, there is no use to them, but only to others to whom they may desire to communicate their knowledges; and it is by no means 
proper for a man who desires to be wise, to halt in knowledges alone, because these are only instrumental causes, intended to serve in the search for uses, which must be of the life. But they answered 
that they are delighted with knowledges, and that to them knowledges are uses. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6815</b></p><p><b>6815.</b>
I have been allowed to introduce into their minds the question of whether or not they wished to make any use of all the knowledge they possessed. For it is not sufficient to take delight simply in knowing, 
because knowledge looks towards useful services, and such services must be the end in view. I have intimated to them that knowledge by itself is not useful to them but will be useful to others 
with whom they may be willing to share it. It is not at all suitable for a person who wishes to be wise to stop at simply possessing knowledge, for knowledge is merely the means to an end; it should serve 
as the means to discover the services that ought to be performed by people in their lives. But those spirits have said in reply that they take delight in knowledge and that knowledge by itself is 
useful to them. </p>

</p><b>6815.</b>
Insinuare datum illis, annon ex cognitionibus suis aliquem usum facere vellent; nam delectari cognitionibus non satis est, quia cognitiones spectant usus, et usus erunt fines; ex solis cognitionibus 
non illis est usus, sed aliis cum quibus cognitiones suas communicare velint, et quod nequaquam conveniat homini qui sapiens vult esse, in solis cognitionibus subsistere quia hae sunt modo causae instrumentales, 
inserviturae indagandis usibus qui vitae erunt; sed {1}responderunt quod delectentur cognitionibus et quod cognitiones illis usus sint. 	@1 respondebant$ </p>
