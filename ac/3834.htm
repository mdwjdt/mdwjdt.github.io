<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3834节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3834.</strong>“拉班带女儿利亚来送给雅各，雅各就与她同房”表只有与外在真理情感的结合。这从“利亚”的代表清楚可知，“利亚”是指对外在真理的情感（参看<a href="3793.htm">3793</a>，<a href="3819.htm">3819</a>节）。把她“送给雅各”明显表示诸如婚姻那样的结合。此中情形是这样：人若感受到对内在真理的情感，也就是渴望知道主国度的更多内在奥秘，那么一开始不会与这些奥秘结合，尽管他知道它们，有时也承认，并且似乎相信它们。因为世俗和肉体的情感仍然存在，这些情感使他接受并似乎相信这些奥秘。但这些情感越存在，内在真理就越无法与他结合。只有对源自良善的真理的情感和对良善的情感才能将这些奥秘附着在他身上。人越被这些情感所打动，更多的内在真理就越与他结合，因为真理是接受良善的器皿。<br />事实上，主规定，除了纯正的情感外，诸如一切内在真理的属天和属灵真理不可与其它任何情感结合。因此，对源自良善的真理的普遍情感先到来，而被植入其中的真理无非是普遍真理。真理的状态与良善的状态完全一致，也就是说，信的状态与仁的状态完全一致。例如：恶人有可能知道主统治整个天堂，也可能知道天堂在于相爱和对主之爱，以及凡在天堂者都凭这些爱而与主结合，并接受那里的智慧和幸福。恶人甚至确信所有这一切都是真的。但信之真理仍不会与他们结合，更不用说爱之良善了。从生活就能知道这些是否与一个人结合，就像凭果子能认出树一样。对恶人来说，这种情形就像无籽的葡萄。当被埋在地里时，无论土壤多么肥沃，它们会分解为纯粹的肥料。这种情形还像夜间的幻火之光，太阳一升起就会消失。蒙主的神圣怜悯，后面会有关于这个问题的进一步讨论。</p>

That he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him, and he came to her. That this signifies that as yet there was conjunction only with the affection of external truth, is evident from the representation 
of Leah, as being the affection of external truth (see n. 3793, 3819). That "to bring her to him" signifies conjunction such as that which is conjugial, is manifest. The case herein is this: 
The man who is in the affection of internal truth, that is, in the desire to know the interior arcana of the Lord's kingdom, has not at first these arcana conjoined with him, even although he knows them, 
and at times acknowledges, and as it were believes them, for as yet there are present with him worldly and corporeal affections, which cause him to indeed receive and as it were believe these arcana; 
but insofar as these affections are present, so far the interior truths in question cannot be conjoined. It is only the affection of truth from good, and the affection of good, that applies these 
arcana to itself; and insofar as man is in these affections, so far interior truths are conjoined with him, for truths are the vessels that receive good. [2] The Lord also provides that celestial and 
spiritual truths (such as are all interior truths) should not be conjoined with any other affections than genuine ones. For this reason the general affection of truth from good precedes, and the truths 
that are insinuated therein are nothing but general truths. The states of truth are altogether in accordance with the states of good, that is, the states of faith with the states of charity. For example: 
it is possible for the wicked to know that the Lord rules the universal heaven, and also that heaven is mutual love and love to the Lord; also that by such love those who are there have conjunction 
with the Lord, and wisdom, and likewise happiness; nay, it is possible for them to be in the persuasion that it is so; and yet the truth of faith may not be conjoined with them, and still less the 
good of love. From the life it is known whether these have been conjoined, just as a tree is known by its fruit. The case in respect to this is like that of grapes in which there are no stones, and 
which, when buried in earth however fertile, dissolve into mere mold; or like that of an ignis fatuus in the night, which is dissipated as soon as the sun rises. But of the Lord's Divine mercy more on 
this subject hereafter. </p>

'That he took Leah his daughter and brought her to him, and he came [in] to her' means that as yet it was a joining merely to the affection for external truth. This is clear from the representation of 
'Leah' as the affection for external truth, dealt with in <a href="3793.htm">3793</a>, <a href="3819.htm">3819</a>. 'Bringing her to him' clearly means a joining together as in marriage. The implications of this are that with a person who feels 
an affection for internal truth, that is, has a desire to know the more internal arcana of the Lord's kingdom, those arcana are not in the beginning joined to him even though he knows them and sometimes 
even though he acknowledges and seemingly believes them. For worldly and bodily affections are still present, and these cause him to take them in and seemingly believe them. But insofar as those affections 
are present those truths cannot be joined to him. It is solely the affection for truth deriving from good and the affection for good which attach them to him. Insofar as anyone is stirred by 
these affections more internal truths are joined to him, for truths are the recipient vessels of good. </p>

 Indeed the Lord provides against celestial and spiritual truths, such as all interior truths 
are, being joined to any affections other than genuine ones. This is why the general affection for truth deriving from good comes first and why truths that are implanted in it are none but general 
truths. States of truth are altogether what they are by virtue of states of good, that is, a state of faith is what it is by virtue of a state of charity. For example, even the evil are able to know 
that the Lord rules the whole of heaven, and also that heaven consists in mutual love and love to the Lord, as well as that these loves enable those in heaven to be joined to the Lord, and to receive 
wisdom and happiness there. The evil can indeed be convinced that all this is true. But the truth of faith has not been joined to them, still less the good of love. It is from the life that one knows 
whether these have been joined to a person, as a tree is known from its fruit. In the case of the evil it is like grapes containing no pips. When these are cast into the soil, no matter how fertile this 
is, they turn into mere compost. It is also like the glow at night of an ignis fatuus which vanishes the moment the sun comes up. But in the Lord's Divine mercy further discussion of this matter will 
appear later on. </p>

`Et accepit Leam filiam suam, et adduxit illam ad eum, et venit ad illam':  quod significet quod solum conjunctio adhuc esset cum affectione veri externi, constat ex repraesentatione `Leae' quod 
sit affectio veri externi, de qua n. 3793, 3819; `adducere illam ad eum' quod sit conjunctio qualis conjugialis, patet.  Haec ita se habent:  qui in affectione veri interni est, hoc est, qui in desiderio 
sciendi arcana interiora regni Domini, principio non illa ei conjuncta sunt, tametsi illa scit, et quandoque tametsi illa agnoscit et quasi credit, sunt enim adhuc affectiones mundanae et corporeae 
quae adsunt, et quae faciunt ut quidem illa {1}accipiat et quasi credat; sed quantum illae affectiones adsunt, tantum vera illa non conjungi possunt; est solum affectio veri ex bono et affectio 
boni quae applicat illa sibi; quantum homo in his affectionibus est, tantum vera interiora ei conjunguntur, nam vera sunt vasa recipientia boni; [2]Dominus enim providet ne caelestia et spiritualia 
vera, qualia sunt omnia {2}interiora vera, conjungantur affectionibus aliis quam genuinis; inde est quod communis affectio veri ex bono praecedat, et vera quae ei insinuantur, non sint nisi communia 
vera; status veri se prorsus habent secundum status boni, seu status fidei secundum statum charitatis, ut pro exemplo, mali etiam possunt scire quod Dominus regat universum caelum, tum quod 
caelum sit amor mutuus et amor in Dominum, ut et quod inde illis conjunctio cum Domino, et inde illis sapientia, et quoque inde illis felicitas, immo possunt in persuasione esse quod ita sit, at usque 
non verum fidei, et minus adhuc bonum amoris illis {3}conjuncta sunt; ex vita cognoscitur num {3}conjuncta (x)sint, sicut arbor ex fructu; se habet hoc sicut uvae in quibus nulli nuclei, quae 
cum in terram utcumque fecundam demittuntur, in fimum fatiscunt; et se habet sicut lumen fatuum noctu, quod {4}veniente sole ilico dissipatur; sed de hac re plura, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in 
sequentibus dicentur. @1 arripiat$ @2 interna$ @3 A alters from singular to plural.$ @4 exoriente$ </p>
