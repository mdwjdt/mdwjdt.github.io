<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8014节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8014.</strong>出埃及记12:50，51.以色列众人照耶和华吩咐摩西、亚伦的行，他们就这样行了。正当那日，耶和华将以色列人按着他们的军队，从埃及地领出来。<br />“以色列众人照耶和华吩咐摩西、亚伦的行”表遵从神之真理的顺服行为。“他们就这样行了”表出于意愿的行为。“正当那日”表主同在的一种状态。“耶和华将以色列人从埃及地领出来”表主将那些处于真理之良善和良善之真理的人从诅咒中释放出来。“按着他们的军队”表这些人照着源自真理的良善之品质而彼此不同。</p>

Verses 50, 51. And all the sons of Israel did as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. And it was in this same day that Jehovah led forth the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their 
armies. "And all the sons of Israel did as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron," signifies the performing of obedience according to truth Divine; "so did they," signifies performance from the will; "and 
it was in this same day," signifies a state of the presence of the Lord; "that Jehovah led forth the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt," signifies that the Lord liberated from damnation those 
who were in the good of truth and the truth of good; "by their armies," signifies these distinct according to the quality of good from truth. </p>

Verses 50, 51 And all the children of Israel did as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron - so they did. And so it was on this same day, that Jehovah brought the children of Israel out of the land of 
Egypt by their hosts. </p>
<p>'And all the children of Israel did as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron' means an act of obedience in accordance with God's truth. 'So they did' means an act initiated by 
the will. 'And so it was on this same day' means a state of the Lord's presence. 'That Jehovah brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt' means that the Lord delivered those governed by 
the good of truth and guided by the truth of good from damnation. 'By their hosts' means those people made distinct from one another by the specific character of their good, which is derived from truth. </p>

Vers. 50, 51.  Et fecerunt omnes filii Israelis quemadmodum praecepit Jehovah Moschi et Aharoni, ita fecerunt.  Et fuit in eodem die hoc, eduxit Jehovah filios Israelis e terra Aegypti quoad exercitus 
illorum.  `Et fecerunt omnes filii Israelis quemadmodum praecepit Jehovah Moschi et Aharoni' significat actum oboedientiae secundum verum Divinum: `ita fecerunt' significat actum ex voluntate: `et 
fuit in eodem die hoc' significat statum praesentiae Domini {1}: `eduxit Jehovah filios Israelis e terra Aegypti' significat quod Dominus liberaverit illos qui in bono veri et vero boni a damnatione: 
`quoad exercitus illorum' significat illos distinctos secundum quale boni a vero. 	@1 i vocatur dies visitationis et ultimum judicium$ </p>
