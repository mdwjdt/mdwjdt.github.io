<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8976节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8976.</strong>“第七年他可以自由，白白地出去”表一种未经他这一方的努力所确认或强化的真理的状态。这从“第七年”和“白白地”的含义清楚可知。“第七年”是指良善与真理结合的一种状态；因为“第七年”与“第七天”或“安息日”所表相同，而“第七天”或“安息日”表示良善与真理的结合，或天上的婚姻，因而表示在一种奴役的状态之后到来的一种平安的状态（参看<a href="8494.htm">8494</a>，<a href="8495.htm">8495</a>，<a href="8510.htm">8510</a>，<a href="8888.htm">8888</a>，<a href="8890.htm">8890</a>，<a href="8893.htm">8893</a>节）；不过，在此处，由于所论述的主题是那些充满真理，却未充满相应的生活良善的人，故“第七年”表示一种确认或强化的真理的状态。原因在于，这些人中间没有良善与真理的结合，不像那些充满仁之良善，在代表意义上由“以色列人”来表示的人；取代这种结合的，是对真理的确认或强化。“白白地”是指未他们这一方的努力，因为当他们承受劳苦和某种争战时，与他们同在的信之真理被主确认或强化，未经他们的任何努力。在以下经文中，“白白地”或“自由地”所表相同：<br />我要将生命水的泉源白白赐给那口渴的人喝。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.6.htm">21:6</a>）<br />启示录：<br />听见的人也该说，来！口渴的人也当来；愿意的，都可以白白取生命的水。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.17.htm">22:17</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />你们一切干渴的都当就近水来，没有银钱的也可以来。你们都来，买了吃；我说，不用银钱，不用价值，也来买酒和奶。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛55.1.htm">55:1</a>）<br />“水”表示来自圣言的真理；“酒”表示来自那里的良善之真理；“奶”表示真理之良善。</p>

And in the seventh year he shall go out free for nothing. That this signifies a state of truth confirmed without exertion on his part, is evident from the signification of "the seventh year," as being 
a state of the conjunction of good and truth; for by "the seventh year" is signified the like as by "the seventh day," or "the Sabbath" (that by this is signified the conjunction of good and truth, 
or the heavenly marriage, thus the state of peace which succeeds after a state of servitude, see n. 8494, 8495, 8510, 8888, 8890, 8893). But here, as those who are in truth and not in the corresponding 
good of life are treated of, by "the seventh year" is signified a state of confirmed truth. The reason is that with such there is no conjunction of truth and good, as there is with those who are in 
the good of charity, and who are understood in the representative sense by the sons of Israel; but instead of this conjunction there is the confirmation of truth. And from the signification of "for nothing" 
[gratis], as being without exertion on their part; for when they are in labor and in some combat the truth of faith with them is confirmed by the Lord without any exertion of theirs. The like is 
signified by "for nothing," or "freely," in these passages: </p>
<p>     I will give unto him that is athirst from the fountain of the water of life freely (Rev. 21:6.)      He that heareth, let him say, 
Come; and he that is athirst, let him come; and he that will, let him take the water of life freely (Rev. 22:17).      Everyone that thirsteth, go ye to the water, and he that hath no silver; go ye, 
buy and eat; go ye, I say, buy wine and milk without silver and without price (Isa. 55:1). "The waters" denote truths from the Word; "wine," the truth of good therefrom; and "milk," the good of truth. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8976</b></p><p><b>8976.</b>
'And in the seventh he shall go out free, for nothing' means a state of strengthened truth without its works. This is clear from the meaning of 'the seventh year' as a state in which goodness and truth 
have been joined together ('the seventh year' is similar in meaning to the seventh day or the sabbath, by which goodness and truth joined together or the heavenly marriage is meant, thus a state of 
peace which comes after a state of servitude, see <a href="8494.htm">8494</a>, <a href="8495.htm">8495</a>, <a href="8510.htm">8510</a>, <a href="8888.htm">8888</a>, <a href="8890.htm">8890</a>, <a href="8893.htm">8893</a>), though here - since the subject is those imbued with truth and not with the complementary goodness of life - 'the 
seventh year' means a state of strengthened truth (the reason why this is meant is that with them goodness and truth are not joined together as they are with those who are imbued with the good of charity 
and who are meant in the representative sense by 'the children of Israel'; instead of those two joined together there is strengthened truth); and from the meaning of 'for nothing' as without their 
works, for when they endure labour and some conflict, the truth of faith with them is strengthened by the Lord without any works of theirs. The same thing is meant by 'for nothing' in John, </p>
<blockquote>
To him 
who thirsts I will give from the spring of the water of life for nothing. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2021:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 21:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
Let him who hears say, Come! And let him who thirsts come. And let him who wishes take the 
water of life for nothing. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2022:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 22:17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Everyone who thirsts, come to the waters; and he who has no money, come, buy and eat! Come, I say, buy wine and milk without money and without 
price. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2055:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 55:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Waters' stands for truths from the Word, 'wine' for the truth of good from there, and 'milk' the good of truth. </p>

</p><b>8976.</b>
`Et in septimo exibit ad liberum gratis': quod significet statum confirmati veri absque ejus opera, constat ex significatione `anni septimi' quod sit status conjunctionis boni et veri, per annum enim 
septimum simile significatur quod per diem septimum seu sabbatum; quod per hoc significetur conjunctio boni et veri, seu conjugium caeleste, ita status pacis qui succedit post statum servitutis, videatur 
n. 8494, 8495, 8510, 8888, 8890, 8893; hic autem, quia agitur de illis qui in vero et non correspondente bono vitae sunt, per `septimum annum' significatur status confirmati veri; causa est quia 
apud hos non est conjunctio veri et boni sicut apud illos qui in bono charitatis sunt, et in sensu {1}repraesentativo per `filios Israelis' intelliguntur, sed pro illa est confirmatio veri; et ex significatione 
`gratis' quod sit absque illorum opera, nam verum fidei apud illos, cum in labore et aliqua pugna sunt, confirmatur a Domino absque ulla eorum opera; simile per `gratis' significatur apud 
Johannem, 	Ego sitienti dabo ex fonte aquae vitae gratis, Apoc. xxi 6: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Qui audit, dicito, Veni, et qui sitit, venito, et qui vult, sumito aquam vitae gratis, Apoc. xxii 17: </p>
<p>et apud Esaiam, 	Omnis 
sitiens, ite ad aquas, et cui non argentum, ite, emite, et comedite; ite, inquam, emite sine argento et sine pretio vinum et lac, lv I; </p>
<p>`aquae' pro veris ex Verbo, `vinum' pro vero boni 
inde, et `lac' pro bono veri. @1 interno$ </p>
