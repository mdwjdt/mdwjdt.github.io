<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4326节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4326.</strong>有一次，我听见一道隆隆的雷声，是从后脑勺上方相当高的地方传来的，并持续传遍整个区域。我想知道他们是谁，被告知，他们就是那些与非自主的总体感官活动有关的人。我还被告知，他们能清楚感知一个人的思想，却不愿意透露并说出它们，就像小脑能感知大脑所行的一切，却不泄露它一样。当他们公开进入后脑勺的整个区域的活动结束后，他们的活动范围就显现出来了。首先它伸向整个脸部；然后退到左脸，最后退到耳朵那一侧。这一系列活动表示自最早期以来存在于这个地球上的人类当中非自主的总体感官活动的性质，以及这种活动是如何发展的。<br />来自小脑的流注主要注入脸部，这一点从以下事实明显可知：人的意向就写在他的脸上，他的情感也呈现在脸上。这一切绝大部分是在人有意识的意愿之外发生的，如当恐惧、敬畏、羞耻、各种快乐和悲伤，以及许多其它情绪出现时的情形；它们以这样的方式为别人所知：他从这个人的脸就能知道此人里面有哪些情感，意向和心智在他里面发生哪些改变。当没有伪装在里面时，这些感觉就从小脑经由其纤维传递。我以刚才所提到的方式得到指示：在最早的时代，也就是上古之人当中，总体感官活动在整个脸部进行，但在这些时代之后，就逐渐被限制在脸的左侧，在后来时代之后，最终离开了脸部，以至于如今脸上几乎没有任何非自主的一般感官活动留下。右脸连同右眼与对良善的情感相对应，左脸连同左眼与对真理的情感相对应。耳朵所属的区域对应于没有情感的纯粹顺服。<br />对于其时代被称为黄金时代的上古之人来说，由于他们处于完美或完整的状态，并如天使那样活在对主之爱和相爱中，所以小脑的非自主努力在脸上表现得很明显，那时除了照着天堂流入其非自主努力，进而流入意愿的方式外，他们根本不知道如何在脸上表现出任何东西。而对于其时代被称为白银时代的古人来说，由于他们处于真理的状态，并由此处于对邻之仁，所以小脑的非自主努力在右脸并不明显，只在左脸明显。但对于他们的后代，也就是其时代被称为黑铁时代的人来说，由于他们没有对真理的情感，只有对真理的顺服，所以非自主努力在脸上不再明显，而是挪到左耳的周边区域。我被告知，小脑纤维就这样改变了它们向外进入脸部的流注，来自大脑的纤维取而代之，转到那里，现在控制来自小脑的纤维。对它们的这一切控制皆源于一种努力，即照着来自大脑的人自己意愿的指令在脸上形成表情。这些事在人看来并不明显，但凭着天堂的流注和对应关系，它们对天使来说是显而易见的。</p>

There was heard a sound as of muttered thunder that flowed down from on high above the occiput, and continued around the whole of that region. I wondered who they were, and was told that they were those 
who relate to the general involuntary sense, and was told further that they could well perceive a man's thoughts, but are not willing to expose and utter them-like the cerebellum, which perceives 
all that the cerebrum does, but does not publish it. When their manifest operation into all the province of the occiput had ceased, it was shown how far their operation extended. It was first determined 
into the whole face, then withdrew itself toward the left side of the face, and at last toward the ear on that side; by which was signified what was the nature of the operation of the general involuntary 
sense from the earliest times with men on this earth, and how it advanced.  [2] Influx from the cerebellum insinuates itself especially into the face, as is evident from the fact that the animus 
has been inscribed on the face, and the affections appear in the face, and this for the most part without the man's will-such as fear, reverence, shame, various kind of gladness, and also of sadness, 
besides many other things, which are thereby made known to another in such manner that it is known from the face what affections are in the man, and what changes of animus and of mind. These things 
come from the cerebellum through its fibers, when there is no simulation within. It was thus shown that in the earliest times, or with the most ancient people, the general sense had possession of the 
whole face, and successively after those times only of the left side of it, and at last in still later times it emptied itself away from the face, so that at this day there is scarcely any general involuntary 
sense left in the face. The right side of the face together with the right eye corresponds to the affection of good, and the left to the affection of truth, the region where the ear is corresponding 
to obedience alone without affection.  [3] For with the most ancient people, whose age was called the Golden Age, because they were in a certain state of perfection or wholeness, and lived in 
love to the Lord and in mutual love as angels live, all the involuntary of the cerebellum was manifest in the face, and they did not at all know how to present anything in the countenance other than 
exactly as heaven flowed into their involuntary conatus or endeavors and thence into the will. But with the ancients, whose age was called the Silver Age, because they were in a state of truth, and thence 
in charity toward the neighbor, the involuntary of the cerebellum was not manifest in the right side of the face, but only in the left. But with their posterity, whose time was called the Iron Age, 
because they lived not in the affection of truth, but in obedience to truth, the involuntary was no longer manifest in the face, but betook itself to the region around the left ear. I have been instructed 
that the fibers of the cerebellum have thus changed their efflux into the face, and that instead of them fibers from the cerebrum have been transferred thither, which now control those which 
are from the cerebellum, and this from an endeavor to form the expressions of the face according to the behests of man's own will, all of which is from the cerebrum. It does not appear to man that these 
things are so, but they are plainly manifest to the angels from the influx of heaven and from correspondence. </p>

I once heard a rumbling of thunder which came from fairly high up above the rear of the head and persisted around the whole of that region. I wondered who they were and was told that they were those 
who related to general sensory activity that is involuntary. I was told in addition that they can perceive well a person's thoughts but that they are not willing to uncover them and declare what they 
are, like the cerebellum which perceives every activity of the cerebrum but does not divulge it. When their overt operation into the whole province of the rear of the head had come to an end, the extent 
of their operation was shown. First of all it reached into the whole face; after that it moved away towards the left side of the face, and finally towards the ear on that side. And what this series 
of events meant was the nature of general sensory activity which is involuntary as this existed from earliest times with people on this planet and how that activity developed. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 Influx from the 
cerebellum instills itself primarily into the face. This is clear from the consideration that a person's disposition is written into his face and his affections are visible on it. This occurs for the 
most part independently of the person's conscious will, as when fear, awe, shame, various kinds of gladness and also of sadness present themselves, besides many other emotions which become known to another 
in such a way that he recognizes from the person's face which affections stir him and what changes of disposition and mind are taking place in him. These feelings are conveyed from the cerebellum 
through its fibres when no presence lies within. I was shown in the manner referred to above that in earliest times, that is, among the most ancient people, general sensory activity went on in the whole 
of the face, but that after those earliest times it was gradually limited to the left side of it, and finally after those later times moved away from the face, so much so that nowadays scarcely any 
general sensory activity that is involuntary is left in the face. The right side of the face, together with the right eye, corresponds to the affection for good, whereas the left corresponds to the 
affection for truth. The region where the ear belongs corresponds to mere obedience that is devoid of affection. </p>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 For with the most ancient people, whose age was called the Golden Age, because 
they lived in a state of wholeness and in love to the Lord and in mutual love, as angels do, every involuntary endeavour of the cerebellum was evident in the face, and at that time they did not know how 
to display anything in the countenance in any way other than as heaven, in a comparable manner, flows into involuntary endeavours, and so into the will. But with the ancients whose age was called the 
Silver Age, because theirs was a state of truth from which they had charity towards the neighbour, the involuntary endeavour of the cerebellum was not evident on the right side of the face, only on 
the left. But with their descendants, whose times were called the Iron Age, because the affection for truth did not govern their lives, only an obedience to it, that involuntary endeavour was no longer 
evident in the face but moved away into the region around the left ear. I have been informed that the fibres of the cerebellum have thus effected a change in their outward flow into the face, and that 
in their place fibres from the cerebrum have been transferred to go in that direction, which now control those from the cerebellum. All this control of them stems from an endeavour to form expressions 
on the face as the person bids by his own will from the cerebrum. It is not apparent to man that these things are so, but it is quite evident to angels from the influx of heaven and from correspondence. </p>

Auditus est susurrus tonans qui defluebat ex altiore supra occipitium et circum totam ejus regionem perstabat; miratus quinam essent; mihi dictum quod essent qui referrent `sensum communem involuntarium'; 
et porro dictum quod ii bene percipere possent hominis cogitata, sed non volunt exponere et eloqui, sicut cerebellum quod percipit omne id quod cerebrum, sed non evulgat.  Cum cessavit eorum 
operatio manifesta in omnem provinciam occipitii, ostensa est eorum operatio quousque se extenderet; </p>
<p>determinabatur primum in totam faciem, dein se trahebat versus faciei partem sinistram, et demum 
versus aurem ibi; quibus significabatur qualis operatio sensus communis involuntarii fuerit a primis temporibus apud homines in hac tellure, et quomodo progressa.  [2] Influxus ex cerebello se 
insinuat imprimis in faciem, quod constat ex eo quod faciei inscriptus sit animus, et quod in facie appareant affectiones, et hoc utplurimum absque hominis voluntate, sicut timor, reverentia, pudor, 
laetitiae varia genera, etiam tristitiae, praeter plura quae alteri inde nota fiunt, ita ut ex {1} facie sciat quae affectiones et quae mutationes animi mentisque ejus sint; haec a cerebello per 
ejus fibras, (o)quando non simulatum inest; ostensum ita quod sensus communis primis temporibus, seu apud antiquissimos, occupaverit totam faciem, et quod successive post illa tempora modo sinistram ejus 
partem, et denique post haec tempora se effuderit extra faciem, adeo ut hodie vix aliquis sensus communis involuntarius in facie residuus sit; dextra pars faciei cum dextro oculo correspondet 
affectioni boni; sinistra autem affectioni veri; regio ubi auris soli oboedientiae absque affectione: [3] apud antiquissimos enim, quorum saeculum dictum fuit aureum, quia in quodam statu integritatis 
ac in amore in Dominum inque amore mutuo sicut angeli vixerunt, patuit omne involuntarium cerebelli in facie, et tunc prorsus non sciebant vultu aliud sistere quam prout influxit caelum in 
conatus involuntarios, et inde in voluntatem; </p>
<p>sed apud antiquos, quorum saeculum dictum fuit argenteum, quia in statu veritatis et inde in charitate erga proximum fuerunt, patuit involuntarium quod 
cerebelli, non in faciei parte dextra sed modo in sinistra; at apud posteros illorum, quorum tempus fuit dictum saeculum {2} ferreum, quia non in affectione veri, sed in oboedientia veri degerunt, 
non amplius patuit involuntarium in facie, sed recepit se in regionem circum aurem sinistram; </p>
<p>instructus sum quod fibrae cerebelli effluxum suum in faciem ita mutaverint, et quod loco illarum fibrae 
e cerebro illuc translatae sint, quae `tunc' imperant illis quae ex cerebello {3}; et hoc ex conatu formandi vultus faciei secundum nutus voluntatis propriae quae ex cerebro; haec non apparent homini 
quod ita sit, sed manifeste patet angelis ex influxu caeli, et correspondentia.      @1 i homo$      @2 saeculum dictum fuit$      @3 i sunt$ </p>
