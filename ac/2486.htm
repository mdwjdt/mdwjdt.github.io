<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2486节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2487.</strong>我曾得到指教，就本身而言，外部记忆只不过是某种有机物，这种有机物是通过感官物体，尤其视觉和听觉的物体，在物质里面形成的，这些物质是纤维的开端。被复制的形式上的各种变化照着这些物体所留下的印象而产生。这些形式照着情感和信念状态的变化而不同和变化。内部记忆同样是某种有机物，只是更纯粹、更完美。它通过内在视觉的物体形成，这些物体以一种无法理解的秩序而被组织成有规律的序列。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2486</b></p><p><b>2486.</b>
That men have with them everything of the corporeal memory, both in general and in particular, has frequently been made evident to me from those with whom I had been acquainted during their life in the 
body, in that when I spoke with them they recognized everything they had done while I was present, and which they had then spoken and thought. From these and many other experiences, it has been given 
me to know for certain that a man carries with him into the other life all things of the exterior or corporeal memory. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2486</b></p><p><b>2486.</b>
The fact that people retain every single detail of their physical memory has also been proved to me very many times from persons with whom I had been acquainted during their lifetime. When I have talked 
to them they have recollected every single thing which they had done while I was present, or which they had said and thought at the time. From these and many other experiences I have been given to 
know for certain that man carries with him into the next life everything that belongs to the exterior or physical memory. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2486</b>
</p><b>2486.</b>
Quod homines omnia et singula memoriae corporeae secum habeant, constare mihi saepissime etiam potuit ex illis quos notos habui in vita corporis eorum, quod cum locutus cum iis, recognoverint omnia 
et singula quae me praesente fecerant quaeque locuti sunt et quae tunc cogitaverunt.  Ex his et pluribus aliis experientiis, pro certo scire datum est quod homo omnia memoriae exterioris seu corporeae 
secum in alteram vitam ferat. </p>
