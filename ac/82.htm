<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第82节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>82.</strong>创世记2:1 天地万物都造齐了。<br />这话表示人已成为十足的属灵之人，在状态上已达到“第六日”，“天”表其内在，“地”表其外在，“万物”表爱、信以及对两者的认知，就是之前“大光”和“众星”所象征的。<br />对于内在被称为“天”，外在被称为“地”，这从前一章已引用的经文可知。又如：“我必使人比精金还少，使人比俄斐纯金更少。我必使天震动，使地摇憾，离其本位。”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.12.htm">13:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.13.htm">13</a>）<br />再如：“你忘记铺张诸天，立定地基，创造你的耶和华……但我要将我的话传给你，用我的手影遮蔽你，为要铺开诸天，立定地基。”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛51.13.htm">51:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛51.16.htm">16</a>）<br />由以上经文可知，“天”和“地”都是指人而言，虽特指上古教会，但就圣经的内义而言，凡论及教会的，也论及教会的每一员。个人若不成为一个教会，就不能成为教会的一部分，正如人若不成为主的一座圣殿，就不能成为圣殿所象征的教会或天堂。因此，上古教会被称作单数的“人”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]82.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_82/bible_king-james-version_genesis_2_1" target=_top>Genesis 2:1</a>. And the heavens and the earth were completed, and their whole army.<br />This means that we are now spiritual — so much so that we have become "the sixth day." Heaven is our inner and the earth our outer being. Their army is love and faith, and knowledge about love and faith. These things were symbolized earlier by the great lights and the stars.<br />Scriptural passages quoted in the preceding chapter demonstrate that the inner being is called heaven and the outer being is called earth.{*1} Let me add another from Isaiah:<br />I will render a man more rare than solid gold, and a human being [more rare] than the precious gold of Ophir.{*2} Therefore I will strike the heavens with terror, and the earth will quake out of its place. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_82/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_13_12-13" target=_top>Isaiah 13:12-13</a>)<br />And another:<br />You will forget Jehovah your maker, who stretches out the heavens and founds the earth. But I will put my words in your mouth, and in the shadow of my hand I will hide you, to stretch out heaven and found the earth. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_82/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_51_13" target=_top>Isaiah 51:13</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_82/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_51_16" target=_top>16</a>)<br />All of this makes it clear that both heaven and earth refer to humankind.<br />Although the earliest church forms the subject here, the Word in its inner depths is such that whatever it says about the church applies also to every individual in the church. If we were not each a church, we could not be part of the church. Likewise, anyone who is not a temple to the Lord cannot be what the Temple symbolizes: a church and a heaven.<br />This is why the earliest church is referred to as a human being in the singular.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} There are a great many Scripture passages quoted in the previous chapter (from somewhere other than <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_82/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_1-31" target=_top>Genesis 1</a>) that mention "heaven" or "earth": see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_82/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_17" target=_top>17</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_82/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_22" target=_top>22-25</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_82/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_28" target=_top>28-29</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_82/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_31" target=_top>31</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_82/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_34" target=_top>34</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_82/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_37" target=_top>37</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_82/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_40" target=_top>40</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_82/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_46" target=_top>46</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_82/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_49" target=_top>49-50</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_82/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_52" target=_top>52</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_82/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_55" target=_top>55</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_82/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_58" target=_top>58</a>.

Verse 1. And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the army of them. By these words is meant that man is now rendered so far spiritual as to have become the "sixth day;" "heaven" is his internal 
man, and "earth" his external; "the army of them" are love, faith, and the knowledges thereof, which were previously signified by the great luminaries and the stars. That the internal man is called 
"heaven" and the external "earth" is evident from the passages of the Word already cited in the preceding chapter, to which may be added the following from Isaiah: </p>
<p>     I will make a man more rare 
than solid gold, even a man than the precious gold of Ophir; therefore I will smite the heavens with terror, and the earth shall be shaken out of its place (Isa. 13:12-13).      Thou forgettest Jehovah 
thy Maker, that stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundations of the earth; but I will put My words in thy mouth, and I will hide thee in the shadow of My hand, that I may stretch out 
the heaven, and lay the foundation of the earth (Isa. 51:13, 16). From these words it is evident that both "heaven" and "earth" are predicated of man; for although they refer primarily to the Most Ancient 
church, yet the interiors of the Word are of such a nature that whatever is said of the church may also be said of every individual member of it, who, unless he were a church, could not possibly 
be a part of the church, just as he who is not a temple of the Lord cannot be what is signified by the temple, namely, the church and heaven. It is for this reason that the Most Ancient Church is called 
"man" in the singular number. </p>

Verse 1 And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.  </p>
<p>These words are used to mean that the individual has now become spiritual to the point of being the sixth day. 'Heaven' 
is his internal man, and 'earth' his external. 'The host of them' are love, faith, and cognitions of them, which previously were meant by 'the great lights and the stars'. That the internal man is 
called 'heaven' and the external 'earth' becomes clear from the quotations from the Word given in the previous chapter, to which the following from Isaiah may be added,    I will make man (vir) more 
rare than fine gold, and man (homo) than the precious gold of Ophir. Therefore I will strike the heavens with terror, and the earth will be shaken out of its place. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2013:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 13:12, 13</a>.  </p>
<p>And elsewhere 
in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
You will forget Jehovah your Maker, who stretches out the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth. But I will put My words in your mouth and hide you in the shadow of My hand, that 
I may stretch out heaven and lay the foundation of the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2051:13,%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 51:13, 16</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>These quotations show that both heaven and earth have reference to man (homo). They refer, it is true, to the Most Ancient 
Church, but the more interior contents of the Word are such that whatever statement is made about the Church is a statement about the individual member of the Church. If he were not the Church, 
he could not be a part of the Church, just as anyone who is not a temple of the Lord cannot be that which is meant by a temple, namely the Church and heaven. This also is why the Most Ancient Church 
is called Man (a singular noun).  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 82</b>
</p><b>82.</b>
Vers. 1.  Et absoluti sunt caeli et terra, et omnis exercitus eorum. Per haec intelligitur quod homo nunc spiritualis factus, in tantum ut sit 'sextus dies'; 'caelum' est internus ejus homo, et 'terra' 
est externus; 'exercitus eorum' sunt amor, fides, et cognitiones illorum, quae prius significata sunt per 'luminaria magna et stellas.' Quod internus homo dicatur 'caelum,' et externus 'terra,' ex 
citatis in Verbo locis in capite praecedente constare potest; addere licet quae apud Esaiam, Rarum reddam virum prae auro solido, et homine prae auro pretioso Ophiris; propterea caelos terrore percutiam, 
et concutietur terra e loco suo, xiii 12, 13; </p>
<p>et alibi, Oblivisceris Jehovae Factoris tui, Qui extendit caelos, et fundat terram;...sed ponam verba Mea in ore tuo, et in umbra manus...abscondam 
te, ad extendendum caelum, et fundandum terram, li 13, 16; </p>
<p>ex quibus patet quod de homine praedicetur et caelum et terra: de Antiquissima quidem Ecclesia agitur, sed interiora Verbi ita se habent ut 
quicquid dicitur de Ecclesia, dicatur de unoquovis Ecclesiae, qui nisi foret Ecclesia, non potuisset esse pars Ecclesiae; sicut qui non est templum Domini, non potest esse quod per 'templum' significatur: 
quod est Ecclesia, et caelum: ideo etiam Ecclesia Antiquissima appellatur 'homo' in singulari. </p>
