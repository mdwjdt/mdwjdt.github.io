<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8893节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8893.</strong>“第七日便安息”表那时有平安和爱之良善存在。这从“安息”和“第七日”的含义清楚可知：“安息”是指平安；“第七日”是指天堂之爱的状态（参看<a href="8487.htm">8487</a>节），因而是指神圣之物（<a href="395.htm">395</a>，<a href="433.htm">433</a>，<a href="716.htm">716</a>，<a href="5265.htm">5265</a>，<a href="5268.htm">5268</a>节）。“第七日便安息”之所以表示平安和爱之良善，是因为一个人在重生或新造之前，是没有平静或安息的；事实上，那时他的属世生命与他的属灵生命争战，想要掌控它。因此，这时主有劳碌，因为祂为那人而与发起攻击的地狱争战。不过，一旦爱之良善被植入，争战就会止息，随之而来的是安息，因为现在此人被带入天堂，被主照着那里的秩序律法引导。“耶和华在第七日便安息”就表示这些事。</p>

And rested in the seventh day. That this signifies that then are peace and the good of love, is evident from the signification of "resting," as being peace; and from the signification of "the seventh 
day," as being a state of heavenly love (see n. 8487), and therefore what is holy (n. 395, 433, 716, 5265, 5268). That by "rest in the seventh day" is signified peace and the good of love, is because 
before a man is regenerated, or created anew, he is in an untranquil and restless state, for his natural life then fights with his spiritual life, and wishes to rule over it. Consequently at this time 
the Lord has labor, for He fights for man against the hells which assault. But as soon as the good of love has been implanted, the combat ceases, and rest ensues, for the man is then introduced into 
heaven, and is led by the Lord according to the laws of order there, thus in peace. These things are signified by "the rest of Jehovah in the seventh day." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8893</b></p><p><b>8893.</b>
'And rested on the seventh day' means that at that time peace and the good of love are present. This is clear from the meaning of 'resting' as peace; and from the meaning of 'the seventh day' as the 
state of celestial love, dealt with in <a href="84.htm">84</a>-<a href="87.htm">87</a>, and therefore what is holy, <a href="395.htm">395</a>, <a href="43.htm">43</a>}, <a href="716.htm">716</a>, <a href="5265.htm">5265</a>, <a href="5268.htm">5268</a>. The reason why 'resting on the seventh day' means peace and the good of love is that before a person 
has been regenerated or created anew there is no serenity or rest, since his natural life engages in conflict at that time with his spiritual life and wishes to have dominion over it. Consequently the 
Lord at that time labours, for He fights for the person against the hells that attack. But as soon as the good of love has been implanted conflict comes to an end, and rest takes over; for now the 
person is brought into heaven and is led by the Lord in accord with the laws of order there, and so is at peace. These things are meant by 'Jehovah's rest on the seventh day'. </p>

</p><b>8893.</b>
`Et quievit in die septimo': quod significet quod tunc pax et bonum amoris, constat ex significatione `quiescere' quod sit pax, et ex significatione `diei septimi' quod sit status caelestis amoris, 
de qua n. 84-87, et inde sanctum, n. 395, 433, 716, 5265, 5268; quod per `quietem in die septimo' significetur pax et bonum amoris, est quia homo antequam regeneratus seu e novo creatus est, in intranquillo 
ac irrequieto est, nam tunc pugnat vita naturalis ejus cum vita spirituali, ac illa vult dominari super hanc; inde tunc Domino est labor, nam pugnat pro homine contra inferna quae impugnant; ast 
ut primum implantatum est bonum amoris, {1} cessat pugna et fit quies, introducitur enim tunc in caelum ac ducitur a Domino secundum leges ordinis ibi, ita in pace; haec significantur per `quietem Jehovae 
in die septimo.' @1 i tunc$ </p>
