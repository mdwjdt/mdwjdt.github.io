Verses 5-8. And they dreamed a dream both of them, each his dream in one night, each according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the 
prison house. And Joseph came unto them in the morning, and saw them, and behold they were troubled. And he asked Pharaoh's courtministers that were with him in the custody of his lord's house, saying, 
Wherefore are your faces evil today? And they said unto him, we have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell it me, 
I pray. "And they dreamed a dream both of them," signifies foresight concerning them; "each his dream in one night," signifies concerning the event which to them was in obscurity; "each according to 
the interpretation of his dream," signifies which they had in themselves; "the butler and the baker," signifies concerning the sensuous things of both kinds; "of the king of Egypt," signifies which were 
subordinate to the interior natural; "who were bound in the prison house," signifies which were among falsities; "and Joseph came unto them in the morning," signifies revealed and clear to the celestial 
of the natural; "and saw them," signifies perception; "and behold they were troubled," signifies that they were in a sad state; "and he asked Pharaoh's court ministers" signifies the sensuous things 
in question; "that were with him in the custody of his lord's house," signifies which were rejected; "saying, Wherefore are your faces evil today?" signifies from what affection was this sadness; 
"and they said unto him," signifies perception concerning these things; "We have dreamed a dream," signifies prediction; "and there is no interpreter of it," signifies that no one knows what is in them; 
"and Joseph said unto them," signifies the celestial of the natural; "Do not interpretations belong to God?" signifies that the Divine is in these things; "tell it me, I pray," signifies that it should 
be known. </p>
