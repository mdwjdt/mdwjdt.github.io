<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2069节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2069.</strong>“必有百姓的君王从她而出”表出于相联结的真理与良善的真理，也就是“百姓的君王”。这从“君王”和“百姓”的含义清楚可知，“君王”一般表示一切真理（参看<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>节）；“百姓（即人民）”也表示真理，一般表示一切属灵之物；因为“君王”论及百姓，并不怎么论及民族，除非民族表示邪恶（参看<a href="1259.htm">1259</a>，<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>节）。在圣言的预言部分，“君王”和“百姓”经常被提及，但它们从来就不是指君王和百姓。因为就圣言本身，即内义而言，所论述的主题根本不是君王和百姓，而是属于主国度的属天和属灵之物，因而是良善和真理。字义仅仅通过可感知的物体来表达自己，就像人用话语来表达自己一样，只是为了使它的意思能被理解。<br />此处“必有百姓的君王从她而出”论及撒拉，而“撒拉”表示主所拥有的神性真理，故“百姓的君王”明显表示出于相联结的真理与良善的真理，也就是内在教会的一切真理，或信的内层真理（interior truths）。这些真理出自主，所以它们在圣言中经常被称为“王的众子”，如前所示（<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>节）。<br />谁都能看出，“必有百姓的君王从她而出”这句话里面隐藏着某种内在神性事物。因为本节论述的主题是以撒，论到以撒，经上说“我要赐福给他，他也要成为多族”；而论到撒拉，经上则说“必有百姓的君王从她而出”，这与第六节论及亚伯拉罕的话几乎一样，即“君王从他而出”，只是经上不像论及撒拉那样论及他，论到撒拉时，经上说“必有百姓的君王从她而出”。其中的奥秘藏得太深，以至于无法用几句话来揭示和描述。这个奥秘从亚伯拉罕代表和表示神性良善，撒拉代表和表示神性真理，可在某种程度上变得明显，大意是：一切属天真理要从“亚伯拉罕”所表示的主的神性良善而出并存在，而一切属灵真理要从“撒拉”所表示的主的神性真理而出并存在。属天真理是属天天使所具有的真理，属灵真理则是属灵天使所具有的真理。或也可说，属天真理是大洪水前属天的上古教会成员所具有的真理，而属灵真理则是大洪水后属灵的古教会成员所具有的真理。因为天使和教会成员都被分为属天的和属灵的。对主之爱将属天者与属灵者区别开来，而对邻之爱则将属灵者与属天者区别开来。<br />然而，若不知道属天者与属灵者之间的区别，或也可说，不知道属天教会与属灵教会的区别，那么对于属天真理与属灵真理就没什么可说的了。关于这些区别，可参看第一卷（<a href="202.htm">202</a>，<a href="337.htm">337</a>，<a href="1577.htm">1577</a>节）；关于上古教会和古教会的各自性质，可参看597，607，640，765，114-1125节等；拥有对主之爱是属天者，拥有对邻之爱是属灵者（参看<a href="2023.htm">2023</a>节）。<br />这些考虑足以说明这个奥秘，也就是说，第六节提到的“从亚伯拉罕所出的君王”表示从主的神性良善所流入的属天真理；而本节提到的“从撒拉所出的百姓的君王”表示从主的神性真理所流入的属灵真理。主的神性良善只能流入属天之人，因为它流入意愿部分，如上古教会的情形；而主的神性真理流入属灵之人，因为它唯独流入理解力部分，而他里面的理解力部分已经与意愿部分分离（参看<a href="2053.htm">2053</a>节末尾）。或也可说，属天良善流入属天之人，属灵良善流入属灵之人。正因如此，主向属天天使显为一轮太阳，向属灵天使显为一轮月亮（参看<a href="1529.htm">1529</a>，<a href="1530.htm">1530</a>节）。 </p>

Kings of peoples shall be from her. That this signifies truths from the conjoined truths and goods, which are the "kings of peoples," is evident from the signification of "kings," as being in general 
all truths (see above, n. 2015); and from the signification of "peoples," as also being truths, and in general all things spiritual; for "kings" are predicated of peoples, and not of nations except when 
nations signify evils (see n. 1259, 1260). In the prophetic Word there is frequent mention of "kings" and "peoples;" but by these are never meant kings and peoples; for in the very Word itself, which 
is the internal sense, kings and peoples are not treated of at all, but the celestial and spiritual things which belong to the Lord's kingdom, thus goods and truths. The sense of the letter simply 
furnishes objective forms (as is done by human words) for causing its meaning to be understood.  [2] As it is here said of Sarah that "kings of peoples shall be from her," and as by "Sarah" is signified 
the Divine truth which the Lord had, it is evident that by "kings of peoples" are signified truths from the conjoined truths and goods, which are all truths of the internal church, or the interior 
truths of faith. These truths, being from the Lord, are called "kings" in various passages of the Word, and also "king's sons," as shown above (n. 2015).  [3] Everyone can see that some internal Divine 
thing lies hidden in the words that "kings of peoples shall be from her"- for in this verse Isaac is treated of, and in reference to him it is said, "I will bless her and she shall be for nations;" 
but of Sarah, that "kings and peoples shall be from her"-and also in nearly the same thing being said of Abraham (verse 6), in that "kings should come forth" from him; but it is not said of him as 
of Sarah, that "kings of peoples" should be from him. The arcanum that is herein lies too deeply hidden to be unfolded and described in a few words. From the representation and signification of Abraham 
as being the Divine Good, and from the representation and signification of Sarah as being the Divine Truth, the arcanum is in some measure evident to the effect that all celestial truth will go forth 
and will be from the Lord's Divine Good, meant by "Abraham;" and that all spiritual truth will go forth and will be from the Lord's Divine Truth, meant by "Sarah." Celestial truth is that which is with 
the celestial angels, and spiritual truth is that which is with the spiritual angels; or what is the same thing, celestial truth is that which was with the men of the Most Ancient Church, which was 
before the flood, and which was a celestial church; and spiritual truth is that which was with the men of the Ancient Church, which was after the flood, and which was a spiritual church. For angels, 
as well as men of the church, are distinguished into the celestial and the spiritual. The celestial are distinguished from the spiritual by love to the Lord; and the spiritual are distinguished from 
the celestial by love toward the neighbor.  [4] But concerning celestial truth and spiritual truth no more can be said until it is known what the distinction is between the celestial and the spiritual, 
or what is the same, between the celestial church and the spiritual church (concerning which see Part First, n. 202, 337, 1577; also what was the quality of the Most Ancient Church, and what that of 
the Ancient Church, n. 597, 607, 640, 765, 1114-1125, and in many other places; and that to have love to the Lord is celestial, and to have love toward the neighbor is spiritual, n. 2023).  [5] These 
considerations will suffice to open the arcanum that by the "kings" who should go forth from Abraham, spoken of in the sixth verse, are signified the celestial truths that inflow from the Lord's Divine 
Good; and that by the "kings of peoples" who should be from Sarah, spoken of in the present verse, are signified the spiritual truths that inflow from the Lord's Divine Truth. For the Lord's Divine 
good cannot inflow except with the celestial man, because it inflows into the will part, as it did in the case of the Most Ancient Church; but the Lord's Divine truth inflows with the spiritual man, 
because it inflows solely into his intellectual part, which in him has been separated from his will part (see n. 2053, at the end); or what is the same, celestial good inflows with the celestial man, 
and spiritual good with the spiritual man; and on this account the Lord appears to the celestial angels as a Sun, but to the spiritual as a Moon (see n. 1529, 1530). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2069</b></p><p><b>2069.</b>
'Kings of peoples will be from her' means truths that are the product of truths and goods joined together, meant by 'kings of peoples'. This is clear from the meaning of 'kings' as all truths in general, 
dealt with above in <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, and from the meaning of 'peoples' also as truths, in general all things that are spiritual. For 'kings' are spoken of in reference to peoples, and not so much in reference 
to nations except when the nations mean evils, dealt with in <a href="1259.htm">1259</a>, <a href="1260.htm">1260</a>. In the prophetical part of the Word kings and peoples are mentioned many times, but nowhere are they used to mean kings and 
peoples, for at no point are kings and peoples the subject in the Word proper, which is the internal sense, but the celestial and spiritual things comprising the Lord's kingdom, and so goods and truths. 
The sense of the letter expresses itself by means of perceivable objects, as anyone does with words, merely to enable understanding. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Since the subject here is Sarah and the promise that 'kings 
of peoples will be from her', and since 'Sarah' means Divine Truth which was the Lord's, 'kings of peoples' clearly means truths that are the product of truths and goods joined together, which are 
all the truths of the internal Church, that is, the interior truths of faith. Because these truths come from the Lord, they are frequently called 'kings' in the Word, and also 'a king's sons', as shown 
above in <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Anyone may see that some internal Divine matter lies concealed in the words that 'kings of peoples will be from her'. For the subject in this verse is Isaac, of whom it is said, 
'I will bless him, and he will become nations', but of Sarah that 'kings of peoples will be from her'. Almost the same was also said of Abraham in verse 6 above, that 'kings will go out of him'; but 
it did not say as it does of Sarah, 'kings of peoples'. The arcanum within this lies too deep to allow it to be uncovered and described in a few words. From the representation and meaning of 'Abraham' 
as Divine Good and from the representation and meaning of 'Sarah' as Divine Truth the arcanum is to some extent evident, namely that from the Lord's Divine Good meant by 'Abraham' all celestial truth 
will come forth and have its being, and from the Lord's Divine Truth meant by 'Sarah' all spiritual truth will do so. Celestial truth is the truth which exists with celestial angels, and spiritual truth 
that which exists with spiritual angels. Or what amounts to the same, celestial truth was the truth which existed with members of the Most Ancient Church which came before the Flood and which was 
a celestial Church, spiritual truth that which existed with members of the Ancient Church which came after the Flood and was a spiritual Church. For angels, as also members of the Church, are distinguished 
into celestial and spiritual. That which distinguishes the celestial from the spiritual is love to the Lord, and that which distinguishes spiritual from celestial is love towards the neighbour. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
No more can be said about celestial truth and spiritual truth however until the difference between the celestial and the spiritual is known, or what amounts to the same, the difference between 
the celestial Church and the spiritual. For this see Volume One, in <a href="202.htm">202</a>, <a href="337.htm">337</a>, <a href="1577.htm">1577</a>; then concerning the nature of the Most Ancient Church and the nature of the Ancient Church, in <a href="597.htm">597</a>, <a href="607.htm">607</a>, <a href="640.htm">640</a>, <a href="765.htm">765</a>, <a href="1114.htm">1114</a>-<a href="1125.htm">1125</a>, and in many other places. On the point that possessing love to the Lord constitutes the celestial, and possessing love towards the neighbour the spiritual, see <a href="2023.htm">2023</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 These considerations 
now show what the arcanum is, namely that 'the kings who will go out of Abraham', referred to in verse 6, mean celestial truths that flow in from the Lord's Divine Good, while 'the kings of peoples 
who will be from Sarah', referred to in the present verse, mean spiritual truths that flow in from the Lord's Divine Truth. For the Lord's Divine Good is unable to flow in except with the celestial 
man since it is an influx into the will part of his mind, as was the case with the Most Ancient Church, whereas with the spiritual man the Lord's Divine Truth is flowing in since the influx is solely 
into the understanding part, which in him has been separated from the will part, <a href="2053.htm">2053</a> (end). Or what amounts to the same, celestial good is flowing in with the celestial man, and spiritual good with 
the spiritual man. As a consequence the Lord is seen by celestial angels as the Sun, but by spiritual angels as the Moon, <a href="1529.htm">1529</a>, <a href="1530.htm">1530</a>. </p>

`Reges populorum ex illa erunt': quod significet vera ex conjunctis veris et bonis, quae sunt `reges populorum,' constat ex significatione `regum' quod (t)sint in genere' omnia vera, de qua supra n. 
2015; et a significatione `populorum' quod etiam sint vera, in genere omnia spiritualia; nam `reges' praedicantur ex populis, non ita ex gentibus nisi dum gentes significant mala, de qua n. 1259, 1260. 
 In Verbo prophetico reges et populi pluries nominantur, sed per illos nusquam intelligantur reges et populi, nam de regibus et populis nihil agitur in ipsissimo Verbo quod est sensus internus, sed 
de caelestibus et spiritualibus quae sunt regni Domini, ita de bonis et veris; sensus litterae modo praebet objecta, sicut voces humanae, ad intelligendum sensum qui inde.  [2] Hic quia agitur de Sarah, 
quod `ex illa reges populorum erunt,' et per `Sarah' significatur Divinum Verum quod Domino, constat quod per `reges populorum' significentur vera ex conjunctis veris et bonis, quae sunt omnia vera 
internae Ecclesiae seu interiora fidei; haec vera quia a Domino, passim in Verbo vocantur `reges,' tum etiam `filii regis,' ut supra n. 2015 ostensum.  [3] Quisque (t)videre potest quod aliquod internum 
Divinum in his verbis, quod `reges populorum ex illa erunt,' reconditum lateat, nam in hoc versu de Isaco agitur, et de illo dicitur {1} `benedicam ei, et erit in gentes,' sed de Sarah, quod `reges 
populorum ex illa erunt'; tum quod etiam de Abrahamo supra vers. 6, simile paene dictum, quod `reges ex illo exibunt,' non autem ut de Sarah, quod `reges populorum'; arcanum quod inibi, altius latet 
quam ut paucis possit evolvi et describi; a repraesentatione et significatione `Abrahami' quod sit Divinum Bonum, et a repraesentatione et significatione `Sarah' quod sit Divinum Verum, aliquantum patet, 
nempe quod ex Divino Bono Domini per `Abrahamum' intellecto, omne caeleste verum, et ex Divino Vero Domini per `Sarah' intellecto, omne spirituale verum, exibit et erit; caeleste verum est quod 
apud caelestes angelos, et spirituale verum, quod apud spirituales angelos; seu quod idem, caeleste verum erat quod apud homines Antiquissimae Ecclesiae quae ante diluvium, fuit, quae Ecclesia caelestis 
fuit, spirituale verum, quod apud homines Antiquae Ecclesiae quae post diluvium, et Ecclesia spiritualis fuit; angeli enim, sicut etiam homines Ecclesiae, distinguuntur in caelestes et spirituales; 
illi distincti sunt ab his per amorem in Dominum, hi distincti ab illis per amorem erga proximum: [4] sed de caelesti vero et (o)de spirituali vero non plura dici possunt priusquam sciatur quae distinctio 
sit inter caeleste et spirituale, seu quod idem est', inter Ecclesiam caelestem et spiritualem, de qua videantur quae in Parte Prima n. 202, 337, 1577; tum qualis Antiquissima Ecclesia et qualis 
Antiqua, n. 597, 607, 640, 765, 1114-1125, et pluries in aliis locis; et quod habere amorem in Dominum, caeleste sit, et quod habere amorem erga proximum, spirituale, n. 2023.  [5] Arcanum inde nunc 
patet, [nempe] quod per `reges qui ex Abrahamo exibunt,' de quibus vers. 6, significentur caelestia vera quae a Domini Divino Bono influunt, et quod per `reges populorum qui ex Sarah erunt,' de quibus 
in hoc versu, significentur spiritualia vera quae a Domini Divino Vero influunt; Divinum enim Bonum Domini non potest influere nisi apud caelestem hominem, quia influit in partem ejus voluntariam, ut 
apud Antiquissimam Ecclesiam; Divinum autem Verum Domini influit apud hominem spiritualem, quia solum in partem ejus intellectualem, quae in eo separata est a parte ejus voluntaria, (o)n. 2053 ad fin.'; 
seu quod idem, caeleste bonum influit apud hominem caelestem, spirituale bonum apud hominem spiritualem; quare Dominus caelestibus angelis apparet ut Sol, spiritualibus vero ut Luna, n. 1529, 1530. 	@1 i quod.$ </p>
