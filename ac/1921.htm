<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1921节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1921.</strong>“你看怎样好，就怎样待她吧”表绝对掌控。这是显而易见的，无需解释。就内义而言，这句话代表和表示主凭自己的力量战胜、征服并逐出邪恶。这邪恶来自祂的遗传物，也慢慢进入这第一理性。因为正如已说过的，这理性由如同父亲的内在人，即耶和华成孕，由如同母亲的外层人生出。凡从外层人生出之物都有遗传元素在其中，因而具有邪恶。这就是主凭自己所战胜、征服并逐出的，并且最后，祂使自己的理性变成神性。祂做这一切全凭自己的力量，这一事实可从本节经文的每一个细节清楚看出来，如经上说“你的婢女在你手中”，这表示祂将这理性置于自己的掌控之下；接下来经上说“你看怎样好，就怎样待她吧”，这表示对它的绝对掌控；然后“撒莱苦待她”，这表示制服。<br />这些事涉及代表智性真理的撒莱。智性真理属于主自己，是其思维的源头，如前所述（<a href="1904.htm">1904</a>，<a href="1914.htm">1914</a>节），祂由此拥有对理性的绝对掌控，也拥有对属于外层人的属世层的绝对掌控。祂通过智性真理思考，并通过神性良善直觉（这良善也是祂的，因为它是父的，祂没有其它灵魂），故只可能凭祂自己的力量行事。由于祂凭自己的力量征服并逐出祂的遗传之恶，故祂也凭自己的力量将人性本质与神性本质融合起来，因为一个是另一个的结果。<br />从耶和华成孕的那一位除了耶和华外，没有其它内在，即没有其它灵魂。因此，就其真生命而已，主就是耶和华自己。耶和华，或神性本质无法象人父的灵魂那样分裂。后代从人父成孕，这后代越远离父亲的形像，就越远离这父亲，并随着年龄增长而越来越远离。正因如此，父亲对孩子的爱会随着他们长大而减弱。但主的情况不是这样。随着祂长大，祂的人性本质不是远离，而是不断靠近，直至实现完美的合一。由此明显可知，祂与耶和华父完全一样，如祂本人所清楚教导的 （约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.6.htm">14:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.8.htm">8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.11.htm">11</a>）。</p>

Do to her that which is good in thine eyes. That this signifies absolute control, is evident without explication. In the internal sense these words represent and signify that the Lord, from His own power, 
conquered, subjugated, and expelled the evil which from His hereditary nature had insinuated itself also into this first rational, for as has been said the rational was conceived of the internal 
man, which was Jehovah, as a father, and was born of the exterior man as a mother. Whatever was born from the exterior man had the hereditary nature with it, and therefore it had evil with it. It was 
this that the Lord conquered, subjugated, and expelled, and at last made Divine [His rational] by His own power. That it was by His own power is evident from everything contained in this verse, as from 
its being said, "Thy handmaid is in thy hand," by which is signified that that rational was in His sovereign power; and now, "Do to her that which is good in thine eyes," by which is signified absolute 
control over it; and then, "Sarai humbled her," by which is signified subjugation.  [2] The words now under consideration were said to Sarai, by whom is represented the intellectual truth that belonged 
to the Lord Himself, and from which He thought (as before said, n. 1904, 1914), and from which He had absolute control over the rational and also over the natural that was of the exterior man. 
He who thinks from intellectual truth, and perceives from Divine good-which good also was His, because the Father's, for the Father was His soul and He had no other-cannot do otherwise than act from 
His own power. And therefore, because by His own power He subdued and cast out the evil of His hereditary nature, He also by His own power united the Human Essence to the Divine Essence, for the one is 
a consequence of the other.  [3] He who is conceived of Jehovah has no other internal, that is no other soul, than Jehovah; and therefore as to His veriest life the Lord was Jehovah Himself. Jehovah, 
or the Divine Essence, cannot be divided, as can the soul of a human father, from which offspring is conceived. So far as this offspring recedes from the likeness of the father, so far it recedes from 
the father, and this it does more and more as age advances. It is from this that a father's love for his children diminishes with their advance in age. It was not so with the Lord; as age advanced 
He did not recede as to the Human Essence, but continually drew nearer, even to perfect union. Hence it is evident that He is the same as Jehovah the Father, as He also clearly teaches (John 14:6, 8-11). </p>

'Do to her what is good in your eyes' means complete control over. This is clear without explanation. In the internal sense these words represent and mean that by His own power the Lord overcame, subdued, 
and cast out the evil which from what was hereditary had wormed itself also into this first rational, for, as has been stated, the rational was conceived from the Internal Man, which was Jehovah, 
as a father, and born from the exterior as a mother. Whatever was born from the exterior man possessed this hereditary element within it, thus evil as well. This was what the Lord overcame, subdued, 
and cast out by His own power and at length made Divine. The fact that He did so by His own power is clear from every single detail in this verse - the comment, 'Your servant-girl is in your hand' which 
means that He had this rational under His controlling power, followed next by 'so to her what is good in your eyes' which means complete control over it; and immediately after that 'Sarai humiliated 
her' which means subjection.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 These things were said to Sarai, who represents intellectual truth which the Lord Himself had and was the source from which He thought, as stated above in <a href="1904.htm">1904</a>,<a href="1914.htm">1914</a>, 
and from this truth He had complete control over the rational and also over the natural that was part of the exterior man. Anyone who thinks from intellectual truth and perceives from Divine good 
- which good was also His because it was the Father's, for He had no other soul - cannot do other than act from the power that is his own. Since therefore by His own power He tamed and cast out the 
evil present by heredity, it was by His own power as well that He united the Human Essence to the Divine Essence - the one being a consequence of the other. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 One who is conceived from Jehovah has 
no other Internal, that is, has none but Jehovah as his soul; for that reason He was as regards His very life itself Jehovah Himself. Jehovah, or the Divine Essence, cannot be divided in the way a human 
father's soul from which a child is conceived can be divided. To the extent the offspring moves away from the likeness of its father it moves away from the father himself, more and more so as it 
grows older. This is why a father's love for his children diminishes as they grow older. In the Lord's case it was different. As He grew older He did not so move away as regards the Human Essence but 
constantly drew closer until perfect union was achieved. From this it is clear that He is identical with Jehovah the Father, as He Himself also plainly teaches in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:6,%208-11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:6, 8-11</a>. </p>

`Fac ei quod bonum in oculis tuis': quod significet imperium, constat absque explicatione. In sensu interno haec repraesentant et significant quod Dominus ex propria potentia evicerit, subjugaverit 
et expulerit malum quod ex hereditario quoque se in primum hoc rationale insinuavit, nam sicut dictum, rationale conceptum fuit ab Interno Homine qui fuit Jehovah ut a patre, et natum ab exteriore ut 
a matre; quicquid ab exteriore, hoc secum habuit hereditarium, ita quoque malum; hoc fuit quod Dominus propria potentia evicit, subjugavit et expulit, et tandem Divinum fecit: quod ex propria potentia, 
ab omnibus et singulis quae in hoc versu constat; ut quod `ancilla tua in manu tua', per {1}quae significatur quod rationale illud esset in potestate Ipsius; et nunc quod dicatur `fac ei quod bonum 
in oculis tuis,' quo significatur imperium super illud; et mox `humiliavit eam Sarai,' quo significatur subjugatio:  [2] haec dicta sunt ad Sarai, per quam repraesentatur verum intellectuale, quod fuit 
Ipsius Domini, ex quo cogitavit, ut supra n. 1904, 1914 dictum, et ex quo imperium habuit super rationale, ut et super naturale quod {2}erat exterioris hominis; qui ex vero intellectuali cogitat et 
ex bono Divino percipit, quod etiam Ipsius fuit quia Patris, nam alia non Ipsi anima fuit, non potest aliter quam ex propria potentia agere; quare quia malum ex hereditario propria potentia domavit et 
ejecit, etiam ex propria potentia Humanam Essentiam univit Divinae, unum est consequens alterius.  [3] Qui concipitur a Jehovah, non aliud Internum habet, hoc est, non aliam animam, quam Jehovam, quare 
fuit quoad ipsissimam vitam Ipse Jehovah; Jehovah seu (t)Divina Essentia non potest dividi, sicut anima patris hominis ex qua concipitur proles; haec quantum recedit a similitudine patris, tantum a 
patre, ita magis et magis procedente aetate; inde est quod amor patris erga liberos diminuatur secundum aetatis progressionem; aliter Dominus, progrediente aetate quoad Humanam Essentiam non recessit, 
sed continue accessit, usque ad perfectam unionem; inde constat quod idem sit cum Jehovah Patre, ut Ipse quoque clare docet Joh. xiv 6, 8-11. @1 quod$ @2 fuit$ </p>
