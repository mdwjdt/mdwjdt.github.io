<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6604节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6604.</strong>有好几次，一位天使向我显现，他的脸面清晰可见，随着情感而不断变化，这些情感一个接一个在他身上依次、因而从一个极限到另一个极限显现。然而，总体的主导情感保持不变，从这主导情感就能得知这是同一位天使。我被告知，他脸上的变化源于与他联系的社群，这些变化随着联系的变化而发生。首先，他会进入与一个社群比与另一个社群更紧密的联系之中，以此类推，直到依次通过所有社群进行联系。因为思维和情感的延伸有自己的极限，它在最远的社群会消失，就像投向茫茫宇宙中的视线那样逐渐逝去。在这个总体气场的极限里面，思维和情感可以变化；它们时而离这一个社群更近，时而离那一个社群更近。当它们在一个社群的中间时，其它一切社群就到周边去了；这些极限里面的所有变化都能以此类推。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6604</b></p><p><b>6604.</b>
There has occasionally appeared to me an angel, whose face, very plainly seen, was continually varied according to affections, as these succeeded one another with him in order, thus from one limit to 
the other-the universal ruling affection still remaining, by which it could be known that it was the same angel. And I was instructed that the changes of his face came from the societies with which he 
had communication, and that they came forth in accordance with the variations of the communication, as this was nearer with one society than with another, and so on in succession. For the extension 
of the affections and thoughts has its limits, and in the last societies vanishes, and passes away as does the sight into the universe. Within the limits of this general sphere the thoughts and affections 
can be varied, and may now be nearer to one society, and now to another. When they are in the midst of one, then the rest of the societies are to that one in the circumference; and so on with all 
variations in these limits. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6604</b></p><p><b>6604.</b>
On several occasions an angel has appeared to me, with a clearly visible face that was constantly changing as different affections manifested themselves in him one after another in order, thus ranging 
from one limit of affection to the other. Yet the overall ruling affection remained, from which one could tell that it was the same angel. I was informed that the changes in his face were derived from 
the communities with which he was in contact and that these changes took place as that contact varied. First he would come in closer contact with one community than another and so on through all the 
communities in order. For the extension of thoughts and affections has its limits; in the remotest communities it disappears and trails off like sight lost in space. Within the limits of that general 
sphere thoughts and affections can vary. They are closer at one time to one community, at another time to another community, and when they are in among one community, all the other communities are off 
to the sides; and so on with every variation within those limits. </p>

</p><b>6604.</b>
Apparuit mihi aliquoties angelus, et facies ejus conspicue, quae continue variabatur secundum affectiones, qualiter illae sibi mutuo succedebant apud illum in ordine, ita ab uno limite ad alterum, manente 
usque affectione universaliter regnante, e qua cognosci potuit quod idem angelus esset; et instructus sum quod mutationes ejus faciei venirent {1}ex societatibus cum quibus (t)ei communicatio fuit, 
et quod existerent secundum variationes communicationis {2}propioris cum una quam cum altera, ac ita successive; extensio enim affectionum et cogitationum limites suos habet, et {3}in ultimis societatibus 
evanescit, et abit sicut visus in universum; intra limites communis illius sphaerae variari cogitationes et affectiones possunt, et jam propiores esse uni societati, {4}jam alteri; {5} cum in 
medio unius sunt, tunc reliquae societates sunt ei in peripheriis; et sic porro cum omni variatione intra illos limites. @1 d ex$ @2 proximioris$ @3 ubi ultimae societates sunt, ac ibi evanescunt$ @4
