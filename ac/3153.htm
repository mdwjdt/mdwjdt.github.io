<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3153节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3153.</strong>就内义而言，这三节所包含的事从所给出的解释明显看出来；也就是说，属世人的事物正预备接受神性事物，因此“利百加”所表示的那些真理，就是要被引入理性人的良善，并与其联结的真理，正变成神性，这一过程通过流注实现。不过，就内义而言，此处这些事具有这样的特点：它们若不在一个思路中被看到，就会显得过于模糊，以至于无法理解；这更多的是因为它们都些未知之事。例如，当人正在重生时，真理如何从属世人中被召唤出来，并被引入理性人里面的良善中。<br />如今，对绝大多数人来说，这些事完全未知，以致他们对这种事的发生根本没有任何概念。主要原因是，现如今很少有人经历重生；甚至那些正在重生的人也没有从教义得知：信之真理被引入仁之良善、与其联结；并且这一切就发生在理性人中。他们也不知道当这一切发生时，他们的状态会彻底被改变；也就是说，他们的思维不再顺着从信之真理到仁之良善的路线跑，而是顺着从这良善到真理的路线跑。然而，对主来说，这不是重生，而是荣耀；也就是说，一切事物，无论理性人中的事物还是属世人中的事物，都通过祂自己变成了神性。内义则描述了这一切是如何成就的。</p>

What is contained in these three verses, in the internal sense, is indeed manifest from the explication, namely, that the things of the natural man were being prepared for receiving what is Divine, and 
that so the truths signified by "Rebekah," which were to be initiated and conjoined with the good of the rational, were being made Divine, and this by influx. But the things in the internal sense here 
are such that if they are not seen in one view of the thought, they appear too obscure for comprehension, and this the more because they are things not known-for example, how truths are called forth 
out of the natural man, and are initiated into good in the rational, when man is being regenerated.  To most persons at this day these things are so wholly unknown that they do not even know that 
this takes place; chiefly because at this day there are few who are being regenerated; and those who are do not know from doctrine that it is the good of charity into which the truth of faith is initiated 
and with which it is conjoined, and this in the rational; and that then the state is wholly changed, and this so that the man no longer thinks from the truth of faith to the good of charity, but 
from this good to truth. With the Lord however there was not regeneration, but glorification; that is, all things were made Divine by Him, both those in the rational and those in the natural. How this 
was done is described in the internal sense. </p>

What these three verses contain in the internal sense is indeed evident from the explanation given, that is to say, that the things belonging to the natural man were prepared for their reception of Divine 
things, and that thus those truths meant by Rebekah which were to be introduced into and joined to the good of the rational became Divine, and that this was effected by influx. But the contents 
of these verses in the internal sense are such that they seem too obscure to be able to be understood, the more so as they are not known, unless the mind sees them in one overall mental picture. Too obscure 
to be understood, for example, is the manner in which truths are summoned from the natural man and introduced into good in the rational man when a person is being regenerated. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 At the present 
day these matters are so unknown to the majority that such people have no conception at all of any such thing taking place. The chief reason for this is that few at the present day are being regenerated, 
and even those who are do not know from doctrine that it is the good of charity into which the truth of faith is introduced and joined, or that this takes place in the rational. Nor do they know 
that when it takes place their state is completely altered, that is to say, their thought no longer runs from the truth of faith towards the good of charity, but from that good towards truth. With 
the Lord however it was not regeneration but glorification, that is, from Himself all things were made Divine, both those in the rational and those in the natural. How this was effected is described 
in the internal sense. </p>

Quae in tribus his versibus in sensu interno continentur, patent quidem ab explicatione, nempe quod illa quae sunt naturalis hominis, praepararentur ad recipiendum Divina; et sic illa vera, quae per 
`Rebeccam' significantur, quae initiarentur (c)et conjungerentur bono rationalis, Divina fierent, et hoc per influxum: sed {1}quae ibi in sensu interno, sunt talia ut nisi spectentur uno {2}visu cogitationis, 
appareant obscuriora quam ut possint comprehendi, et magis quia ignota sunt; ut haec, quomodo vera e naturali homine evocantur et initiantur bono in rationali, cum regeneratur homo; [2] haec 
plerisque hodie tam ignota sunt, ut ne quidem sciant quod fiat, ex causa imprimis quod hodie pauci sint qui regenerantur, et qui regenerantur, ex doctrina non sciant quod bonum charitatis sit cui verum 
fidei initiatur et conjungitur, et hoc in rationali, et quod tunc status prorsus mutetur, nempe quod non amplius ex vero fidei cogitetur ad bonum charitatis, sed ex bono hoc ad verum. Apud Dominum 
autem non fuit regeneratio, sed glorificatio, hoc est, ab Ipso facta sunt omnia, tam quae in rationali quam quae in naturali, Divina; quomodo haec facta, in sensu interno describitur. @1 i usque$  @2
