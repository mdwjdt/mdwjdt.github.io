<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8682节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8682.</strong>“与摩西的岳父在神面前吃饭”将来自神性良善的这些事物变成自己的。这从“吃”和“饭”的含义清楚可知：“吃”是指变成人自己的（参看<a href="3168.htm">3168</a>，<a href="3513.htm">3513</a>e，<a href="3596.htm">3596</a>，<a href="3832.htm">3832</a>，<a href="4745.htm">4745</a>节）；“饭”是指爱之良善（<a href="2165.htm">2165</a>，<a href="2177.htm">2177</a>，<a href="3464.htm">3464</a>，<a href="3735.htm">3735</a>，<a href="4211.htm">4211</a>，<a href="4217.htm">4217</a>，<a href="4735.htm">4735</a>，<a href="5915.htm">5915</a>节），他们“在神面前吃饭”表示所指的是它来自神性良善。“饭”在此表示那时他们所用的一切食物，尤其是祭物的肉；因为当献上祭物时，祭物的肉在祭坛旁边吃了。“饭（或饼）”表示总体上的一切敬拜（<a href="2165.htm">2165</a>节）。<br />之所以吃祭物的肉，是为了可以代表将天上的良善，以及爱中的亲密无间变成人自己的。他们那时所吃的祭物的肉表示爱之良善；因此，这对他们来说是一个圣宴。“肉”表示爱之良善（参看<a href="7850.htm">7850</a>节）。由此可见当主说，他们要吃“祂的肉”（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.53.htm">6:53</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.56.htm">56</a>）时，以及当祂设立圣餐时，主表示什么；饼是“祂的身体”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.26.htm">26:26</a>）。没有人能知道这些事物的含义，除非他知道祂的话有一个内义，在这内义中，所指的是属天、属灵的事物，而不是属世事物；属世事物对应于这些事物，并照着对应关系而具有灵义。没有关于这些事物的知识，没有人能知道为何要设立圣餐，圣餐的饼有何神圣之处；又为何饼是身体和肉，以及除此之外的其它无数问题。</p>

To eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God. That this signifies the appropriation of these things by virtue of the Divine good, is evident from the signification of "eating," as being appropriation 
(see n. 3168, 3513, 3596, 3832, 4745); and from the signification of "bread," as being the good of love (n. 2165, 2177, 3464, 3735, 4211, 4217, 4735, 5915); that it denotes from the Divine good, 
is signified by their "eating the bread before God." By "bread" is here meant all the food that was used at that time, especially the flesh of the sacrifices; for when sacrifices were offered, the flesh 
of them was eaten beside the altar. (That by "bread" is signified all worship in general, see n. 2165.) [2] The reason why the flesh of the sacrifices was eaten, was that there might be represented 
the appropriation of celestial good, and also consociation by love, for the flesh of the sacrifice which they then ate, signified the good of love; wherefore this was to them a holy feast. (That "flesh" 
denotes the good of love, see n. 7850.) From all this it can be seen what was meant by the Lord when He said that they should "eat His flesh" (John 6:53- 56); and also when He instituted the Holy 
Supper, that the bread was "His body" (Matt. 26:26). No one can ever know the meaning of these things unless he knows that there is an internal sense, and that in this sense are understood celestial 
and spiritual things in place of the natural things; and that the natural things correspond to them, and have a signification according to the correspondences. Otherwise no one could ever know why the 
Holy Supper was instituted, and what holiness there is in the bread; and why the bread is the body and the flesh, besides countless other things. </p>

'To eat bread with the father-in-law of Moses before God' means making their own these things coming from Divine Good. This is clear from the meaning of 'eating' as making one's own, dealt with in <a href="3168.htm">3168</a>, <a href="3513.htm">3513</a> (end), <a href="3596.htm">3596</a>, <a href="3832.htm">3832</a>, <a href="4745.htm">4745</a>; and from the meaning of 'bread' as the good of love, dealt with in <a href="2165.htm">2165</a>, <a href="2177.htm">2177</a>, <a href="3464.htm">3464</a>, <a href="3735.htm">3735</a>, <a href="4211.htm">4211</a>, <a href="4217.htm">4217</a>, <a href="4735.htm">4735</a>, <a href="5915.htm">5915</a>, its coming from Divine Good being meant by the statement 
that they were going to eat bread 'before God'. Here 'bread' is used to mean all the food they had then, in particular the flesh of the sacrifices; for when sacrifices were offered, the flesh in 
them was eaten beside the altar. For the meaning of 'bread' as all food in general, see <a href="2165.htm">2165</a>. </p>
<p>The reason why the flesh of the sacrifices was eaten was in order that making heavenly good one's own 
might be represented, as well as togetherness in love. The flesh of a sacrifice, eaten by them then, meant the good of love, which was why this was for them a sacred feast. For the meaning of 'flesh' 
as the good of love, see <a href="7850.htm">7850</a>. From this one can see what the Lord meant when He said that they were to eat His flesh, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%206:53-56&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 6:53-56</a>, and also, when He instituted the Holy Supper, that the bread was His 
body, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2026:26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 26:26</a>. No one can possibly know what He meant then unless he knows that His words have an inner sense, and that in this sense celestial and spiritual realities are meant instead of natural 
things, and that natural things correspond to those realities and have spiritual meanings in keeping with correspondences. Without knowledge of these things no one could ever know why the Holy Supper 
was instituted, what is holy about the bread, why the bread is the body and is the flesh, and countless other questions besides these. </p>

`Ad comedendum panem cum socero Moschis coram Deo': quod significet appropriationem illorum ex Divino Bono, constat ex significatione `comedere' quod sit appropriatio, de qua n. 3168, 3513 fin., 3596, 
3832, 4745, et ex significatione `panis' quod sit bonum amoris, de qua n. 2165, 2177, 3464, 3735, 4211, 4217, 4735, {1}5915; quod sit ex Divino Bono, significatur per quod comederent panem coram Deo. 
 Per `panem' hic intelligitur omnis cibus qui tunc, imprimis caro sacrificiorum, nam cum sacrificia fiebant, comedebatur caro illorum juxta altare; quod per `panem' significetur omnis (x)cibus in genere, 
videatur n. 2165. 	2 Causa quod caro sacrificiorum comederetur, erat ut repraesentaretur appropriatio boni caelestis, tum quoque consociatio per amorem, nam caro sacrificii quam tunc comedebant 
significabat bonum amoris, quapropter hoc illis erat convivium sanctum; quod etiam caro sit bonum amoris, videatur n. 7850.  Ex his constare potest quid intellectum est a Domino cum dixit quod comederent 
carnem Ipsius, Joh. vi 53-56, tum cum institueret Sanctam Cenam, quod panis esset corpus {2}Suum, Matth. xxvi (x)26; quid per illa intellectum est, nusquam aliquis scire potest nisi sciat quod sensus 
internus sit, et quod in illo sensu intelligantur caelestia et spiritualia loco naturalium, et quod naturalia illis correspondeant, et secundum correspondentias significent; alioquin nusquam alicui 
notum posset esse cur Sancta Cena instituta est, et quid sanctum sit in pane, et cur panis sit corpus et sit caro; praeter innumera alia. 	@1 Before 3735$ 	@2 Ipsius$ </p>
