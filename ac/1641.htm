<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1641节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1641.</strong>在来世，灵人们也会彼此讨论，和世人一样。那些善良的灵人以最亲密的友谊和爱进行讨论，如我所经常听到的那样。讨论时所用的是他们自己的言语，他们用这种言语在一分钟内所表达的，比世人在一个小时内所表达的还要多。因为如前所述，他们的言语是一切语言所通用的，即通过观念说话，是实际话语的最初来源。他们讨论的话题如此精辟、深刻，并运用一个接一个循序渐进、绝对令人信服的系列推理，以致世人若是知道，必会目瞪口呆。他们将信仰和情感交织进他们的讨论中，以此使讨论富有生气。<br />有时，他们讨论时也会运用视觉图像，因而运用活生生的表现形式。例如，讨论羞耻，以及若没有敬畏，羞耻能否存在：在世人中，这种话题只能通过来自经验和实例的众多推理来讨论，尽管如此，它仍留有疑问。而对灵人来说，这个问题一分钟内就能解决，他们只需思考依次变化的羞耻感的状态，以及敬畏的状态；以此直觉一致和分歧，同时在与言语结合的表现形式中注视它们；他们由此立时直觉到结论，这结论因而以这种方式自行从不一致趋向一致。所有其它问题也是这样解决的。死后，灵魂直接进入这种能力，这时，善灵只喜欢教导新人和无知的人。<br />灵人们自己意识不到他们彼此交谈时所用的言语何等优越，他们具有何等天赋异禀，除非主使他们反思此事。因为这种说话方式对他们来说再自然不过，现在是一种本能。这种情形就象人的心思专注于事物的含义，而非这些话和说话方式时的情形，因为若不反思，他有时不知道自己正在使用哪种言语。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1641.</strong> In the next life, spirits converse with each other the same way we do on earth. Good spirits engage in the intimate conversation of loving friends, as I have witnessed many times. They use their customary speech, which enables them to express more in a minute than we could over the course of an hour. As noted, their language is universal, common to all tongues, because it uses ideas 钬?the rudiments of all words 钬?as its medium. They discuss things with such acumen and insight, pursuing so many well-constructed, persuasive lines of reasoning that if people knew about it they would be dumbfounded. Spirits link opinion and feeling, which lends animation to their speech.<br />[2] Sometimes spirits employ representations as well 钬?an appeal to the eye and so to living experience. Take for example a discussion of shame and the question of whether it can exist apart from reverence.{*1} People on earth cannot settle the matter without endless argument involving various proofs and examples, and even then the issue remains in doubt. Spirits, on the other hand, take only a minute. They run in order through the various ways in which shame affects us and then the ways in which reverence does, noticing points of agreement and disagreement. These they also observe in visual representations connected to their speech. From the evidence, they instantly arrive at a conclusion, which rises spontaneously out of the harmony thus imposed on conflicting ideas. All other subjects are dealt with in the same way.<br />Our souls take up this ability immediately after death. Good spirits like nothing better at that time than to teach uninformed newcomers.<br />[3] The spirits themselves are unaware 钬?unless the Lord inspires them to reflect on it 钬?that they speak such an exalted language among themselves or that they enjoy such an outstanding gift. This way of speaking is natural for them, and by then it is ingrained. Their situation is like that of people who fix their minds on the meaning of a message and not on the words or form of expression: if they do not reflect on it, they sometimes do not even know what language is being used.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} In this mention of a hypothetical debate on an academic question, Swedenborg is poking fun at the contrived debates that were a common accompaniment of education from ancient through medieval times and even to his own day. Instructors often chose such topics as that mentioned here and assigned students at random to hold forth on one side of the question or the other. Swedenborg several times expresses his dislike of these contrived exercises, in particular in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1641/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_333" target=_top>True Christianity 333</a>, a wry account of one such debate. For more on such Scholastic academic argumentation, see Swedenborg [1771] 2006, 749-750 note 3 in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1641/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_832" target=_top>832</a>, and Swedenborg [1763] 2003a, 282 note 1 in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1641/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1142" target=_top>1142</a>.

Spirits in the other life converse among themselves as men do on earth; and they who are good, with all familiarity of friendship and love, as I have frequently heard; and this in their own speech, by 
which they express more in a minute than a man can in an hour. For their speech, as before said, is the universal of all languages, being by means of ideas, the primitives of words. They speak upon 
subjects with such acuteness and perspicuity, by so many series of reasons following one another in order, and exercising persuasion, that if a man knew of it he would be astounded. They join persuasion 
and affection to their discourse, and thus give it life.  [2] Sometimes also they discourse by means of simultaneous representations before the sight, and thus to the life. As for example: let the 
discourse be about shame, whether it can exist without reverence: among men this cannot be discussed except by means of many reasonings from evidence and examples, and still it remains in doubt; but 
with a spirit all would be done within a minute, by means of the states of the affection of shame varied in their order, and by means of those of reverence also; thus by perceiving the agreements and 
the disagreements, and at the same time beholding them in the representatives adjoined to the speech; from which they forthwith perceive the conclusion, which thus flows of itself from the disagreements 
thus reduced to agreement. So in all other cases. Souls come into this faculty directly after death; and good spirits then love nothing more than to instruct those who are newly arrived, and the ignorant. 
 [3] The spirits themselves are not aware that they speak with one another with speech of such surpassing excellence, and that they are furnished with an endowment so preeminent, unless it is 
given them by the Lord to reflect upon it; for this mode of speaking is natural to them, and is then inherent. The case in this respect is the same as it is with a man when he fixes his mind on the meaning 
of things, and not on the words and the mode of speaking, in that, without reflection, he sometimes does not know what kind of speech he is making use of. </p>

Spirits in the next life discuss things with one another just as people do on earth. Those who are good do so with all the close intimacy of friendship and love, as I have heard them do many times. They 
discuss these things in their own manner of speech, in which they express more in a minute than man can in an hour; for as has been stated, their speech is the universal of all languages - a speaking 
by means of ideas, the first origins of actual words. Their discussion of subjects is so incisive and penetrating, employing so many lines of reasoning which follow in order one after another and 
which are absolutely convincing, that man would be dumbfounded if he knew of it. They weave persuasion and affection into their discussion and in this way make it live. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Sometimes in their discussions 
they also employ visual, and thus living representations. Their discussion, for example, may be about shame, and whether shame is possible without reverential awe. Among men this cannot be discussed 
except through many reasonings based on proofs and examples; and even then it remains in doubt. But with spirits the matter is resolved within a minute by considering the states of the feeling of 
shame, varied in their sequence, and also the states of reverential awe, and in this way perceiving the agreements and the disagreements, while at the same time seeing these in the representatives woven 
into the discussion, from which in an instant they perceive the conclusion thus flowing of itself from differences of opinion that are reconciled in this fashion. All other questions are resolved 
in a similar way. Souls enter into this ability immediately after death, at which time good spirits love nothing more than teaching newcomers and the uninformed. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Spirits themselves do not realize 
that they speak to one another in so superior a kind of speaking, and that they are furnished with so excellent a gift, unless they are led by the Lord to reflect on the matter, for that speech comes 
to them naturally and is now instinctive. The situation is like that of a person whose mind is intent on the meaning of things and not on the words he uses and the way he speaks, in that unless he 
sometimes stops to reflect he is not aware of what kind of speech he is using. </p>

</p><b>1641.</b>
Spiritus in altera vita inter se colloquuntur, sicut homines in terra; et qui boni sunt, cum omni familiaritate amicitiae et amoris, quod multoties audivi, et hoc loquela sua, qua exprimunt plura minuto 
quam homo potest intra horam temporis, nam loquela eorum est, ut dictum, universalis omnium linguarum, per ideas, primitivas vocum; loquuntur de rebus ita acute et perspicaciter, per tot series rationum 
consequentium ordine et persuadentium ut si homo sciret, obstupesceret; persuasionem et affectionem adjungunt, et sic animant; [2] etiam quandoque simul per repraesentationes ad visum, ita ad 
vivum; ut pro exemplo, si loquela de pudore, num dari queat absque reverentia; apud hominem hoc discuti nequit nisi per multa ratiocinia ab argumentis et exemplis, et usque manet in dubio; at apud spiritum 
intra minutum per status affectionis pudoris variatos ordine, tum reverentiae, et sic per convenientias et disconvenientias perceptas, et simul perspectas in repraesentativis adjunctis loquelae, 
ex quibus ilico percipiunt conclusum, ita ex se fluens ex dissensibus sic in consensum redactis; similiter in omnibus reliquis: in hanc facultatem veniunt animae statim post mortem: nec tunc plus amant 
boni spiritus quam instruere novitios et ignaros.  [3] Ipsi spiritus non sciunt quod inter se loquantur tam praestante loquela, et instructi tam excellente dote, nisi illis datur a Domino reflectere 
super id, nam loquela illa est illis naturalis et tunc insita; se habet hoc, sicut cum homine, cum animum tenet in sensu rerum, non in vocibus et loquela, quod absque reflexione, quandoque nec sciat 
qua loquela loquitur. </p>
