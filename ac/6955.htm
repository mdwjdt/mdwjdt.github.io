Verses 5-7. In order that they may believe that Jehovah hath been seen of thee, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Jehovah said further to him, 
Bring now thy hand into thy bosom. And he brought his hand into his bosom, and brought it out, and behold his hand was leprous, as snow. And He said, Bring back thine hand into thy bosom; and he brought 
back his hand into his bosom, and brought it forth out of his bosom, And behold it was turned again as his flesh. "In order that they may believe that Jehovah hath been seen of thee," signifies that 
they may have faith in respect to the Lord's Divine Human; "the God of their fathers," signifies that it was the Divine of the Ancient Church; "the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob," 
signifies the Lord as to the Divine Itself and the Divine Human; "and Jehovah said further to him," signifies foresight as to what would be the quality of those of the spiritual church, if they 
did not have faith; "Bring thy hand into thy bosom," signifies the appropriation of truth; "and he brought his hand into his bosom," signifies the accomplishment; "and he brought it out," signifies that 
it was thence; "and behold his hand was leprous, as snow," signifies the profanation of truth; "and He said," signifies providence in respect to what would be the quality of those of the spiritual 
church if they did have faith; "Bring back thine hand into thy bosom" signifies the appropriation of truth; "and he brought back his hand into his bosom" signifies the accomplishment; "and he brought 
it forth out of his bosom," signifies that it was thence; "and behold it was turned again as his flesh," signifies that then it was good. </p>

Verses 5-7 [And Jehovah said,] In order that they may believe that Jehovah has appeared to you - the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Jehovah said 
further to him, Put now your hand into your bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom, and took it out, and behold, his hand was leprous, like snow. And He said, Put your hand back to your bosom. And 
he put his hand back to his bosom; and he took it out of his bosom, and behold, it was restored like his [other] flesh. </p>
<p>'In order that they may believe that Jehovah has appeared to you' means in order 
that they may possess faith with regard to the Lord's Divine Human. 'The God of their fathers' means that this was the God of the Ancient Church. 'The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God 
of Jacob' means the Lord in respect of the Divine itself and the Divine Human. 'And Jehovah said further to him' means foresight of what those who belonged to the spiritual Church were going to be like 
if they were not in possession of faith. 'Put your hand into your bosom' means making truth their own. 'And he put his hand into his bosom' means the performance of this. 'And took it out' means what 
was seen from this. 'And behold, his hand was leprous, like snow' means the profanation of truth. 'And He said' means providence showing what those who belonged to the spiritual Church were going 
to be like if they did possess faith. 'Put your hand back to your bosom' means making truth their own. 'And he put his hand back into his bosom' means the Performance of this. 'And he took it out of his 
bosom' means what was seen from this. 'And behold, it was restored like his [other] flesh' means that now it was the good of truth. </p>

Vers. 5-7.  Propterea ut credant quod visus ad te Jehovah, Deus patrum eorum, Deus Abrahami, Deus Jischaki, et Deus Jacobi. Et dixit Jehovah illi adhuc, Adduc nunc manum tuam in sinum tuum; et adduxit 
manum suam in sinum suum, et eduxit illam, et ecce manus ejus leprosa sicut nix.  Et dixit, Reduc manum tuam ad sinum tuum; et reduxit manum suam ad sinum suum, et eduxit illam e sinu suo, et ecce 
reversa sicut caro illius.  `Propterea ut credant quod visus ad te Jehovah' significat ut fidem habeant de Divino Humano Domini: `Deus patrum eorum' significat quod illud Divinum fuerit Antiquae Ecclesiae: 
`Deus Abrahami, Deus Jischaki, et Deus Jacobi' significat Dominum quoad Ipsum Divinum et Divinum Humanum: `et dixit {1}Jehovah illi adhuc' significat praevidentiam quales {2}futuri qui ab Ecclesia 
spirituali {3} si non fidem {4}haberent: `Adduc manum tuam in sinum tuum' significat appropriationem veri: `et adduxit manum in sinum suum' significat actualitatem: `et eduxit illam' significat quod 
inde: `et ecce manus ejus leprosa sicut nix' significat profanationem veri: `et dixit' significat providentiam quales futuri {5}qui ab Ecclesia spirituali si fidem haberent: `Reduc manum tuam ad sinum 
tuum' significat appropriationem veri: `et reduxit manum suam {6}in sinum suum' significat actualitatem: `et eduxit illam e sinu suo' significat quod inde: `et ecce reversa sicut caro illius' significat
