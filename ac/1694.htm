<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1694节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1694.</strong>“他们掳去所多玛和蛾摩拉所有的财物”表他们被剥夺行恶的力量。这从“掳去财物”的含义清楚可知。“所多玛和蛾摩拉的财物”在内义上无非表示邪恶与虚假，“财物”在此表邪恶，“粮食”表虚假。相对善人而言，属灵的财富和富有无非是指主供给并使他们所富有的良善与真理；相对恶人而言，财富和富有无非是指他们为自己获得的邪恶与虚假。这类事物也是圣言中财富所表示的。由此清楚可知，“掳去所多玛和蛾摩拉所有的财物”是指剥夺他们行恶的力量。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1694.</strong> They took all the resources of Sodom and Gomorrah means that [the hells] were stripped of the power to do evil, as the symbolism of taking someone's resources shows. On an inner level, the resources of Sodom and Gomorrah refer exclusively to evil and falsity. The resources here symbolize evil, and the food, falsity. The spiritual riches and wealth that good people have are actually the goodness and truth that the Lord gives them as a gift and enriches them with. So the riches and wealth that bad people have are actually the evil and falsity that they themselves have acquired. These are the things that wealth symbolizes in the Word.<br />This evidence shows that taking the resources of Sodom and Gomorrah means stripping them of the power to do evil. </p>

They took all the wealth of Sodom and Gomorrah. That this signifies that these were deprived of the power of doing evil, is evident from the signification of taking away anyone's wealth. By the wealth 
of Sodom and Gomorrah nothing else is meant in the internal sense but evil and falsity. Evil is here signified by "the wealth," and falsity by "the food." Relatively to the good, spiritual wealth and 
riches are nothing but the goods and truths with which they are gifted and enriched by the Lord; and therefore relatively to the evil, wealth and riches are nothing but the evils and falsities they 
have acquired to themselves. Such things are also signified in the Word by "riches." From this it is evident that to take the wealth of Sodom and Gomorrah is to deprive them of the power of doing evil. </p>

That 'they took all the wealth of Sodom and Gomorrah' means that they were stripped of the power to do evil is clear from the meaning of 'taking someone's wealth'. 'The wealth of Sodom and Gomorrah' 
is used to mean in the internal sense nothing else than evil and falsity, evil being meant here by 'the wealth' and falsity by 'the food'. In relation to the good, spiritual wealth and riches are nothing 
else than the goods and truths with which they are provided and enriched by the Lord; and therefore in relation to the evil, wealth and riches are nothing else than the evils and falsities which they 
have acquired to themselves. Such things are also meant in the Word by wealth. From these considerations it is clear that 'taking the wealth of Sodom and Gomorrah' is depriving them of the power to do evil. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1694</b>
</p><b>1694.</b>
Quod 'sumpserunt omnes opes Sodomae et Amora significet quod deprivati potentia malum agendi, constat a significatione 'sumere opes alicujus'; per opes Sodomae et Amorae in sensu interno non aliud intelligitur 
quam malum et falsum, malum hic significatur per 'opes,' et falsum per 'cibum': opes et divitiae spirituales respective ad bonos, non sunt aliud quam bona et vera quibus donantur et ditantur 
a Domino; ita opes et divitiae respective ad malos, non sunt aliud quam mala et falsa quae sibi ipsis acquisiverunt; talia etiam per opes in Verbo significantur: ex his constat quod 'sumere opes Sodomae 
Amorae' sit privare eos potentia malum agendi. </p>
