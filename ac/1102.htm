<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1102.</strong>“他要住在闪的帐棚里”表为了使敬拜的内在存在于外在。这一点从有关闪的所有论述清楚看出来，大意是，“闪”是内在教会，或内在敬拜，外在敬拜若没有赋予它生命、使其成圣的内在敬拜，则完全是没有灵魂或不洁净之物。“帐棚”无非表示爱的圣洁和由此而来的敬拜，这一点可从“帐棚”的含义（<a href="414.htm">414</a>节）清楚看出来。古人习惯说“旅行和住在帐棚里”，“帐棚”的内义是指神圣的敬拜，因为绝大多数古人不仅随帐棚旅行，还住在帐棚里，并在里面举行神圣的敬拜。因此，“旅行”和“住在帐棚里”的内义表生活。<br />除了前面（<a href="414.htm">414</a>节）所引用的经文外，下面的经文也有助于证明，“帐棚”表神圣的敬拜。诗篇：<br />神离弃示罗的帐幕，就是祂在世人中间居住的帐棚。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗78.60.htm">78:60</a>）<br />此处“帐棚”的含义与“神殿”一样，当神在爱中与人同在时，就说祂“住”在这神殿中。因此，凡生活在神圣敬拜中的个人都被古人称为一个帐棚，后来被称为一座神殿。以赛亚书：<br />要扩张你帐幕之地，张大你居所的幔子。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛54.2.htm">54:2</a>）<br />这表示在那些属真正敬拜的事物上的启示。耶利米书：<br />全地荒废；我的帐棚忽然毁坏，我的幔子顷刻破裂。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.20.htm">4:20</a>）<br />显而易见，此处的帐棚仅指神圣敬拜。撒迦利亚书：<br />耶路撒冷人必仍住在她本处，就是耶路撒冷，耶和华必先拯救犹大的帐棚。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚12.6.htm">12:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚12.7.htm">7</a>）<br />此处“犹大的帐棚”表由爱的圣洁所产生的对主的敬拜。<br />从引用的这些经文清楚可知“住在闪的帐棚里”是什么意思，即为了使敬拜的内在存在于外在。不过，由于“闪”，即外在教会成员并不十分清楚何为内在事物，故对他作以简要描述。若人内心感受到或觉得他有对主的良善思维，也有对邻舍的良善思维，并渴望为他做些善事，但不是为了自己的名利，若他感觉自己对陷入困境的人心怀怜悯，尤其怜悯在信的教义上犯错之人，那么他可能知道自己住在闪的帐棚中，即他拥有主借以作工的内在事物。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1102.</strong> He will live in Shem's tents means so that the inner dimensions of worship exist within the outward forms. This meaning is established by all the things said about Shem so far: Shem is the inner church, or inward worship, and outward worship is only some lifeless, dirty thing without inward worship to give it life and sanctify it.<br />The fact that tents simply mean holy love and the worship that grows out of it can be seen from the symbolism of tents, given earlier, at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1102/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_414" target=_top>414</a>. The ancients habitually used the phrases travel with tents and reside in tents,{*1} which in an inner sense symbolized sacred worship, because the earliest people both moved around and settled down in tents, conducting their sacred worship in them. On an inner level, as a result, migrating and setting up residence also symbolized living.<br />[2] In addition to the passages quoted earlier, in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1102/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_414" target=_top>414</a>, let the following serve to confirm that tents symbolize sacred worship. In David:<br />God deserted his dwelling place at Shiloh, the tent where he lived among humankind. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1102/bible_king-james-version_psalms_78_60" target=_top>Psalms 78:60</a>)<br />The tent has the same symbolism as a temple, and God is said to live in it when he is present with humankind in love. The ancients accordingly called an individual who lived a life of sacred worship a tent, and later a temple.{*2} In Isaiah:<br />Broaden the place of your tent, and let the tent curtains of your dwellings stretch out. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1102/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_54_2" target=_top>Isaiah 54:2</a>)<br />This stands for enlightenment regarding the elements of true worship. In Jeremiah:<br />The whole earth was devastated. In an instant were my tents devastated; in a moment, my tent curtains. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1102/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_4_20" target=_top>Jeremiah 4:20</a>)<br />Obviously it is not tents but holy worship that is meant here. In Zechariah:<br />Jerusalem will still dwell in its place — in Jerusalem. Jehovah will save the tents of Judah. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1102/bible_king-james-version_zechariah_12_6-7" target=_top>Zechariah 12:6-7</a>)<br />The tents of Judah stand for worshiping the Lord in the holiness of love.<br />[3] These passages illustrate what it is to live in Shem's tents: to have inward worship within one's outer worship.<br />But since the human being called Japheth (the person who is in the outer church) does not really know what the inner dimension is, it must be spelled out briefly. Sometimes we might sense or perceive inside ourselves that we are thinking rightly about the Lord, and that we are thinking rightly about our neighbors and wanting to render them assistance without looking for any financial reward or prestige for ourselves. Sometimes we might also feel sympathy for those who are suffering calamity and even greater sympathy for those who are misled about religious doctrine. At these times we can be sure that we are living in Shem's tents, or in other words, that we have inside us a deeper dimension through which the Lord can work.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For scriptural mentions of travel with or residence in tents, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1102/bible_king-james-version_genesis_4_20" target=_top>Genesis 4:20</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1102/bible_king-james-version_genesis_35_21" target=_top>35:21</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1102/bible_king-james-version_numbers_9_17" target=_top>Numbers 9:17</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1102/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_1_33" target=_top>Deuteronomy 1:33</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1102/bible_king-james-version_psalms_15_1" target=_top>Psalms 15:1</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1102/bible_king-james-version_psalms_27_4-5" target=_top>27:4-5</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1102/bible_king-james-version_psalms_61_4" target=_top>61:4</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1102/bible_king-james-version_psalms_120_5" target=_top>120:5</a>.

And he shall dwell in the tents of Shem. That this signifies in order that the internals of worship may be in the externals, is evident from all that has been said before concerning Shem, namely, that 
"Shem" is the internal church, or internal worship, and that external worship is nothing but an inanimate affair, or else an unclean one, unless there is internal worship to vivify and hallow it. That 
the "tents" signify nothing else than what is holy of love, and the derivative worship, is evident from the signification of "tents" (concerning which, see above, n. 414). It was customary among the 
ancients to speak of "journeying" and "dwelling in tents" by which was signified in the internal sense holy worship, for the reason that the most ancient people not only journeyed with tents, but also 
dwelt in tents, and performed their holy worship in them. Hence also "to journey" and "to dwell" signified in the internal sense to live.  [2] That "tents" signify holy worship, the following passages-in 
addition to those before cited (n. 414)-may serve for confirmation. In David: </p>
<p>     God forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent in which He dwelt in man (Ps. 78:60), where "tent" signifies 
the same as "temple" in which God is said to "dwell" when He is present with man in love. Hence the man who lived in holy worship, was called by the ancients a tent, and afterwards a temple. In Isaiah: </p>
<p> 
    Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations (Isa. 54:2), meaning enlightenment in those things which are of true worship. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     The 
whole land is laid waste, suddenly have My tents been laid waste, and My curtains in a moment (Jer. 4:20), where it is very manifest that tents are not meant, but holy worship. In Zechariah: </p>
<p>    
 Jerusalem shall yet again dwell in her own place, even in Jerusalem. Jehovah also shall save the tents of Judah (Zech. 12:6-7), where the "tents of Judah" stand for the worship of the Lord from the holy 
of love.  [3] From these passages it is now evident what it is "to dwell in the tents of Shem" namely, that internal worship is in external. But because the man Japheth, or the man of the external 
church, does not well know what internal things are, this shall be briefly told. When a man feels or perceives in himself that he has good thoughts concerning the Lord, and that he has good thoughts 
concerning the neighbor, and desires to perform kind offices for him, not for the sake of any gain or honor for himself; and when he feels that he has pity for anyone who is in trouble, and still more 
for one who is in error in respect to the doctrine of faith, then he may know that he dwells in the tents of Shem, that is, that he has internal things in him through which the Lord is working. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1102</b></p><p><b>1102.</b>
'He will dwell in the tents of Shem' means so that the internal features of worship may be present in the external features. This becomes clear from all that has been stated already about Shem, to the 
effect that 'Shem' is the internal Church or internal worship, and that external worship is something altogether soulless or unclean if it does not have internal worship to give it life and sanctify 
it. That 'tents' means nothing else than the holiness of love and worship arising out of this becomes clear from the meaning of 'tents' dealt with already in <a href="414.htm">414</a>. Among the ancients 'wandering about 
and dwelling in tents' was common expression, and by 'tents' in the internal sense was meant holy worship, for the reason that the most ancient people not only wandered about with tents but also dwelt 
in tents and used to celebrate holy worship in them. Consequently 'wandering about and dwelling' also meant in the internal sense living. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In addition to the places quoted already in <a href="414.htm">414</a>, let the 
following as well serve to confirm that 'tents' means holy worship: In David,  </p>
<blockquote>
God forsook the dwelling-place at Shiloh, the tent where He dwelt with man. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2078:60&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 78:60</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'tent' has a similar 
meaning to the Temple, in which God is said 'to dwell' when He is present with someone within love. For this reason the individual in whose life holy worship had a place was called by the ancients 'a 
tent', and later 'a temple'. In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Enlarge the place of your tent, and let the curtains of your habitations be stretched out. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2054:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 54:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This stands for enlightenment in the things that belong 
to true worship. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The whole land has been laid waste; suddenly MY tents have been laid waste, My curtains in a moment. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%204:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 4:20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here it is quite evident that tents are not meant 
but holy worship. In Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
Jerusalem will dwell yet again in her own place, in Jerusalem Jehovah will save the tents of Judah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%2012:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 12:6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the tents of Judah' stands for worship 
of the Lord arising out of the holiness of love. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From these quotations it now becomes clear what 'dwelling in the tents of Shem' means, namely, so that internal worship may be present in external. 
But because 'Japheth', the member of the external Church, has little knowledge of what internal things are, a brief description of him will be given. When a person feels or perceives within himself 
that he has thoughts regarding the Lord which are good and thoughts regarding the neighbor which are good, and he wishes to perform acts of kindness for him, but not for the sake of any gain or for 
the sake of his own position, and when he feels that he has pity for anyone who suffers misfortune, and more so for him who errs in regard to the doctrine of faith, he may then know that 'he is dwelling 
in the tents of Shem', that is, that there are with him things of an internal nature by means of which the Lord is working. </p>

'Habitabit in tentoriis Shemi': quod significet ut interna cultus sint in externis, constare potest ab omnibus illis quae prius de Shemo dicta sunt, nempe quod 'Shemus' sit Ecclesia interna seu cultus 
internus, et quod externus cultus nihil aliud sit quam inanimatum quid aut spurcum, nisi internus sit qui illum vivificat et sanctificat: quod 'tentoria' non aliud significent quam sanctum amoris et 
cultum inde, constare potest a significatione tentoriorum, de qua prius n. 414; sollemnis formula apud antiquos fuit 'peregrinari et habitare in tentoriis,' quibus significabatur in sensu interno cultus 
sanctus, ex causa quia antiquissimi non solum peregrinati sunt cum tentoriis, sed etiam habitabant in tentoriis, et ibi cultum sanctum peragebant; inde quoque 'peregrinari et habitare' in sensu interno 
significabat vivere: [2] quod 'tentoria' significent sanctam cultum, praeter loca quae prius n. 414 allata, etiam haec sint confirmationi; apud Davidem, 	Deus deseruit habitaculum Shiloh, tentorium 
ubi habitavit in homine, Ps.lxxviii 60; </p>
<p>ubi 'tentorium' simile significat ac templum in quo Deus 'habitare' dicitur cum praesens apud hominem in amore; inde homo qui in cultu antiquis appellatus 
'tentorium,' at postea templum: apud Esaiam, 	Dilata locum tentorii tui, et cortinas habitaculorum tuorum extendant, liv 2; </p>
<p>pro illustratione in illis quae sunt veri cultus: apud Jeremiam, 	Devastata 
est tota terra; subito devastata sunt tentoria Mea, momento cortinae Meae, iv 20; </p>
<p>ubi quod non tentoria intelligantur, manifeste patet, sed quod cultus sanctus: apud Zachariam, 	Habitabit Hierosolyma 
adhuc sub se in Hierosolyma: salvabit Jehovah tentoria Jehudae, xii [6,] 7; </p>
<p>ubi 'tentoria Jehudae' pro cultu Domini ex sancto amoris.  Ex his nunc constare potest quid sit 'habitare in tentoriis 
Shemi,' nempe ut internus cultus sit in externo.  Sed quia homo 'Japhethus' seu homo externae Ecclesiae non novit ita quid interna sunt, quare paucis dicetur; quando homo apud se sentit aut percipit 
quod cogitet bene de Domino et quod cogitet bene de proximo, eique officia praestare velit, non propter lucrum aliquod aut propter honorem sui; et quando sentit quod misereatur ejus qui in calamitate 
est et magis qui in errore est quoad doctrinam fidei, tunc scire potest quod 'habitet in tentoriis Shemi,' hoc est,quod interna apud se habeat per quae Dominus operatur. </p>
