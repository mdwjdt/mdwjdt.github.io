<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7999节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7999.</strong>“用银子买”表他拥有某种属灵真理。这从“买”和“银子”的含义清楚可知：“买”是指获得并变成自己的（参看<a href="4397.htm">4397</a>，<a href="4487.htm">4487</a>，<a href="5374.htm">5374</a>，<a href="5397.htm">5397</a>，<a href="5406.htm">5406</a>，<a href="5410.htm">5410</a>，<a href="5426.htm">5426</a>节）；“银子”是指真理（<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="2954.htm">2954</a>，<a href="5658.htm">5658</a>节），在此是指属灵真理，因为买来的奴仆或仆人在内义上是指属世人，因此，买他的主人是指属灵人。没有人知道这一切是怎么回事，除非他知道属灵人如何为自己买属世人，也就是如何获得属世人，并将它变成自己的。当人正在重生时，他的内在与外在，也就是属灵层和属世层一开始彼此不合；因为他的属灵层渴望天堂的事物，而他的属世层则渴望世界的事物。但这时，属灵层不断进入属世层，并将它带入一致。这一切通过真理实现；属灵层带进属世层里面与自己一致的东西可以说就是“用银子买”来的，也就是通过真理被获得并变成它自己的。</p>

That is bought with silver. That this signifies who has any spiritual truth, is evident from the signification of "buying," as being acquisition and appropriation (see n. 4397, 4487, 5374, 5397, 5406, 
5410, 5426); and from the signification of "silver," as being truth (n. 1551, 2954, 5658), here spiritual truth, because the servant that is bought is in the internal sense the natural man, and therefore 
the lord who buys is the spiritual man. How this is cannot be known unless it is known how the spiritual buys for itself-that is, acquires and appropriates-the natural. When man is being regenerated, 
his internal and external, that is, the spiritual and the natural, at first are at variance, for the spiritual wills what is of heaven, but the natural what is of the world. But the spiritual then 
continually inflows into the natural and brings it into agreement; this is effected by means of truth; and what the spiritual brings to itself in the natural is called "bought with silver," that is, 
acquired and appropriated by means of truth. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7999</b></p><p><b>7999.</b>
'A purchase paid for with silver' means who is in possession of some spiritual truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'a purchase' as that which is acquired and made one's own, dealt with in <a href="4397.htm">4397</a>, <a href="4487.htm">4487</a>, <a href="5374.htm">5374</a>, <a href="5397.htm">5397</a>, <a href="5406.htm">5406</a>, <a href="5410.htm">5410</a>, <a href="5426.htm">5426</a>; and from the meaning of 'silver' as truth, dealt with in <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="2954.htm">2954</a>, <a href="5658.htm">5658</a>, at this point spiritual truth since a slave who was bought means in the internal sense the 
natural man, and the master who bought him therefore means the spiritual man. No one can know what this really implies unless he knows in what way the spiritual buys the natural for itself, that is, 
acquires and makes it its own. When a person is being regenerated his internal and external, that is, his spiritual and natural, are at variance with each other at first; for his spiritual desires the 
things of heaven, whereas his natural desires those of the world. But at this time the spiritual is constantly entering the natural and bringing it into agreement This is done by means of truth; and 
what the spiritual brings into agreement with itself within the natural is said to be 'bought with silver', that is, acquired and made its own by means of truth. </p>

`Emptio argenti': quod significet cui aliquid verum spirituale, constat (c)a significatione `emptionis' quod sit acquisitio et appropriatio, de qua n. 4397, 4487, 5374, 5397, 5406, 5410, (x)5426; et 
ex significatione `argenti' quod sit verum, de qua n. 1551, 2954, 5658, hic verum spirituale, quia servus qui emptus in sensu interno est naturalis homo, {1} et ideo dominus qui emit est {2} spiritualis. 
 Cum hoc quomodo se habet, non sciri potest nisi sciatur {3}quomodo spirituale sibi emit, hoc est, acquirit et appropriat naturale; cum regeneratur homo, tunc primum dissident internum et externum 
{4}illius, hoc est spirituale et naturale {5}, spirituale enim vult illa quae caeli, {6}naturale autem quae mundi; sed spirituale influit tunc continue in naturale, et adducit illud ad consensum; hoc 
fit per verum, et quod spirituale in naturali sibi adducit {7}, hoc dicitur `emptum argento,' hoc est, acquisitum et appropriatum per verum. 	@1 i n. 7998,$ 	@2 i homo$ 	@3 d quomodo i qualiter$ 	@4
