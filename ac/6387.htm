<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6387.</strong>创世记49:14，15.13.以萨迦是头瘦骨嶙峋的驴，卧在重驮之间。他看安息为美好，以地为可喜悦；便屈肩背重，成为服劳役的仆人。<br />“以萨迦”表从行为或工作中所获得的回报。“是头瘦骨嶙峋的驴”表最低级的服务。“卧在重驮之间”表行为当中的生命。“他看安息为美好”表不思回报的善行充满幸福。“以地为可喜悦”表那些在主国度的人就享有这种幸福。“便屈肩背重”表然而，他却竭尽全力。“成为服劳役的仆人”表使他能赚取功德。</p>

Verses 14, 15. Issachar is a bony ass, lying down between the burdens. And he shall see rest that it is good, and the land that it is pleasant; and he shall bow his shoulder to bear, and shall be a servant 
to tribute. "Issachar," signifies reward from works; "is a bony ass," signifies the lowest service; "lying down between the burdens," signifies life among works; "and he shall see rest that it 
is good," signifies works of good without reward, that they are full of happiness; "and the land that it is pleasant," signifies that in this happiness are they who are in the Lord's kingdom; "and he 
shall bow his shoulder to bear," signifies that nevertheless he labors with all exertion; "and he shall be a servant to tribute," signifies that he may have merit. </p>

Verses 14, 15 Issachar is a bony ass, lying down between burdens. And he will see rest that it is good, and the land that it is pleasant; and he will bend his shoulder to bear a burden, and will be one 
serving for tribute. </p>
<p>'Issachar' means recompense gained from works. 'Is a bony ass' means lowest- ranking service. 'Lying down between burdens' means life among works. 'And he will see rest that 
it is good' means that works of goodness done without thought of recompense are filled with happiness. 'And the land that it is pleasant' means that those in the Lord's kingdom enjoy that happiness. 
'And he will bend his shoulder to bear a burden' means that nevertheless he makes every effort. 'And will be one serving for tribute' means so that he may earn merit. </p>

Vers. 14, 15.  Jisaschar asinus osseus, cubans inter sarcinas.  Et videbit quietem quod bona, et terram quod amoena; et inclinabit humerum suum ad bajulandum; et erit tributo serviens. `Jisaschar' significat 
remunerationem ex operibus: `asinus osseus' significat servitium infimum: `cubans inter sarcinas' significat vitam inter opera: `et videbit quietem quod bona' significat opera boni absque remuneratione 
quod plena felicitate: `et terram quod amoena' significat quod in illa qui in regno Domini: `et (x)inclinabit humerum {1} ad bajulandum significat quod usque omni opera laboret: `et erit tributo 
serviens' significat ut mereatur. @1 A I here and 6393 o suum; cp. above$ </p>
