<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>986.</strong>“都必惊恐、惧怕你们”表内在人的主宰，“惊恐”涉及邪恶，“惧怕”涉及虚假。这从重生之人的状态清楚看出来。人在重生前的状态是属外在人的恶欲和虚假总在其中居于主导地位并造成冲突的状态。不过，一旦他重生，内在人就会主宰外在人，即主宰他的欲望和虚假。当内在人主宰时，这人就会有对邪恶的惊恐和对虚假的惧怕，因为邪恶和虚假违背良知，对他来说，违背良知行事是令人憎恶的。<br />然而，恐惧邪恶、害怕虚假的，不是内在人，而是外在人。故此处经上说：“地上的一切牲畜和空中的一切飞鸟，都必惊恐、惧怕你们”，其中一切恶欲用“牲畜”来表示，一切虚假用“空中的飞鸟”来表示。这种惊恐和惧怕似乎是人自己的，但真相乃是这样：如前所述，每个人身边至少有两位天使和两个恶灵，他通过天使与天堂相联，通过恶灵与地狱相联。当天使主宰时，如重生之人的情形，伴随的恶灵不敢做违背善与真的事，因为这时他们受到束缚。当他们试图做出恶事或言说虚假，即激活它时，某种地狱般的惊恐和惧怕会立刻临到他们。这种惊恐和惧怕就是人的内心对违背良知之事的感受。因此，他一做出或说出违背良知之事，就会陷入试探和良心的折磨中，即陷入地狱般的折磨。<br />至于“惊恐”涉及邪恶，“惧怕”涉及虚假，情况是这样：比起言说虚假，与人同在的精灵不那么惧怕行恶。原因在于，人要重生，并通过信之真理接受良知，因而精灵不可激活虚假。事实上，与他们当中的每一个同在的，无非是邪恶，以致他们浸没在邪恶中；他们的全部本性，以及他们由此所企图的一切都是邪恶；由于他们浸没在邪恶中，他们自己的生命就在于邪恶，所以当致力于某种功用时，他们行恶会得到赦免。但他们不允许言说虚假，这是为了让他们学习真理，并由此尽可能得以纠正，以便他们能履行某些低级的服务。蒙主慈悲，有关该主题的更多内容，容后再述。重生之人的情形也是如此，因为他的良知通过信之真理形成，所以他的良知是对正确的良知。对他来说，虚假正是生命的邪恶，因为虚假颠倒信之真理。不过，上古教会成员的情况不是这样，因为他拥有直觉。他视生命的邪恶为邪恶，视信的虚假为虚假。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]986.</strong> The symbolism of fear of you and terror of you as mastery exerted by the inner self — fear having to do with evil and terror with falsity — can be seen from the circumstances of a regenerate person. Before we have regenerated, our circumstances are ones in which the cravings and falsities of the outer self remain in perpetual control, and this causes a struggle. When we have regenerated, the inner self takes control over the outer, or in other words, over its cravings and falsities. When the inner self is in charge, we respond to evil with fear and to falsity with terror, because both violate conscience, and acting against conscience horrifies us.<br />[2] The inner self, though, is not afraid of evil or frightened of falsity; only the outer self is. So the present verse says that "fear of you and terror of you" will be on "every beast of the earth and every bird of the sky," that is, on all the cravings symbolized by a beast and on the falsities symbolized by a bird of the sky.<br />The fear and the terror seem to be ours, but here is the actual situation: As mentioned before, we each have with us at least two angels connecting us to heaven and two evil spirits connecting us to hell [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_986/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_697" target=_top>697</a>]. When the angels are in charge, as they are in a person reborn, the evil spirits that are present do not dare to make the slightest assault on goodness or truth, because they are then in chains. When they do try to do anything bad or say anything false — or rather try to goad us into doing so — a hellish fear and terror immediately fall on them. Their fear and terror is what we feel when we face anything that violates conscience. In consequence, as soon as we do or say anything that offends conscience, we undergo inner struggle and suffer pangs of conscience, or in other words, experience a kind of torment that feels like hell.<br />[3] The reason fear is used for evil and terror for falsity is that the spirits we have with us are not as fearful of doing wrong as they are of telling lies. It is through the true concepts of faith that people find rebirth and gain conscience, so spirits are not allowed to stir up falsities.<br />Each of these spirits is mere evil, so that they live in evil; their whole nature and consequently their every effort is evil. And since they live in evil, and the vital energy that is their very own consists in evil, the wrong they do is overlooked if they are being useful in some way. Spreading falsity, however, is not permitted. The reason for this prohibition is to enable them to learn what is true and so improve as much as they can, in order to serve some menial use. I will have more to say on this later, though, the Lord's divine mercy permitting [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_986/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5846" target=_top>5846-5865</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_986/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5976" target=_top>5976-5993</a>].<br />The situation is similar in regenerate people, because their conscience is formed out of the truth taught by faith. As a result, their conscience focuses on correctness, and to them the evil that one commits is actually falsity, because it violates religious truth. (It was different for the people of the earliest church, who had perception. They perceived the evil that one commits as evil, and the falsity that one believes in as falsity.) </p>

The fear of you and the terror of you. That this signifies the dominion of the internal man, "fear" having reference to evils, and "terror" to falsities, is evident from the state of the regenerate man. 
The state of man before regeneration is such that cupidities and falsities, which are of the external man, continually predominate, and hence arises a combat; but after regeneration the internal man 
has dominion over the external, that is, over its cupidities and falsities, and then the man is in fear of evils and in terror of falsities, both of which are contrary to conscience, and to act in 
opposition to this affects him with horror. Howbeit, it is not the internal but the external man that fears evils and dreads falsities, wherefore it is here said "let the fear of you and the terror of 
you be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every bird of the heaven" that is, upon all cupidities, here signified by "beasts" and upon all falsities, here meant by the "bird of heaven." This "fear" 
and this "terror" appear as if they were the man's own, but they arise from the following cause. As has been previously stated, there are with every man at least two angels, through whom he has communication 
with heaven, and two evil spirits, through whom he has communication with hell. When the angels rule-as is the case with the regenerate man-then the attendant evil spirits dare not attempt 
to do anything contrary to what is good and true, because they are in bonds; for, on their attempting to do anything evil, or to speak what is false-that is, to excite it-they are instantly seized with 
a kind of infernal fear and terror. This fear and terror are what are perceived in the man as a fear and terror for what is contrary to conscience; and therefore as soon as he does or speaks anything 
contrary to conscience, he comes into temptation, and into the pangs of conscience, that is, into a kind of infernal torment. As to "fear" being predicated of evils, and "terror" of falsities, the case 
is this: the spirits with a man do not so much fear to do evils as they do to speak falsities, because man is born again and receives conscience through the truths of faith, and therefore the spirits 
are not allowed to excite false things. With everyone of them there is nothing but evil, so that they are in evil; their very nature, and all their effort therefrom is evil; and since they are in 
evil, and their proper life consists in evil, they are pardoned for doing evil when they are serving any use. But it is not permitted them to speak anything false, and this in order that they may learn 
what is true, and thus so far as possible be amended, so that they may serve some low use; but concerning this subject, of the Lord's Divine mercy, more hereafter. Similar is the case with the regenerate 
man, for his conscience is formed of the truths of faith, and therefore his conscience is a conscience of what is right, what is false being to him the very evil of life, because it is contrary 
to the truth of faith. It was otherwise with the man of the Most Ancient Church, who had perception. He perceived evil of life as evil, and falsity of faith as falsity. </p>

That 'the fear of you and the dread of you' means the lordship of the internal man - 'fear' having regard to evils and 'dread' to falsities - becomes clear from the state of a regenerate person. A person's 
state prior to regeneration is one in which the evil desires and the falsities that belong to the external man predominate all the time, which gives rise to conflict. But once he has been regenerated 
the internal man rules over the external, that is, over his desires and falsities. When it is the internal man that rules, the person has a fear of evils and a dread of falsities, for both evils 
and falsities are contrary to conscience, and to act contrary to conscience is abhorrent to him.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It is not however the internal man that fears evils and dreads falsities, but the external; hence 
the statements at this point about the fear of you and the dread of you being upon every beast of the earth and every bird of the air<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>, that is, over all evil desires meant by 'beast' and over falsities 
meant by 'bird of the air'.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> This fear and this dread are seemingly the person's own, but the reality is this: As stated already everybody has at least two angels with him through whom he has 
communication with heaven, and two evil spirits through whom he has communication with hell. When the angels rule, as is so with a regenerate person, the evil spirits who are present dare not do anything 
contrary to what is good and true, for they are at that time held in bonds. And when they do try to do anything evil or to utter what is false - that is, to activate it - some hellish kind of fear 
and dread instantly overtakes them. This fear and this dread are what a person feels within himself for things that are contrary to conscience. This also is why, as soon as he does or utters anything 
contrary to conscience, he runs into temptation and the gnawings of conscience, that is, into a kind of hellish torment.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 On the point that fear has reference to evils and dread to falsities, 
the situation Is this: The spirits that reside with a person are less afraid of practising evil deeds than of uttering falsities, the reason being that a person is born again and receives a conscience 
by means of truths of faith, and consequently spirits are not allowed to activate falsities. Indeed nothing but evil is present with every one of them, so that they are immersed in evil; their whole 
nature, and consequently everything they attempt is evil; and since they are immersed in evil and their own life within them consists in evil, their performance of evil is ignored when they are serving 
some use. But they are not permitted to utter anything false, for the reason that they may learn what is true, and in so doing may be corrected, so far as possible, to perform some inferior kind of 
service. But more concerning these matters will in the Lord's Divine mercy be mentioned later on. It is similar with a regenerate person, for his conscience is formed from truths of faith. Consequently 
his conscience is a conscience for what is right. For him the very evil of life lies in falsity because falsity is the reverse of the truth of faith. But with the member of the Most Ancient Church who 
had perception it was different. He perceived evil of life as evil, and falsity of faith as falsity.

Quod 'timor vestri et terror vestri' significet dominium interni hominis, et quod 'timor' spectet mala et 'terror' facta, constare potest a statu hominis regenerati; status hominis antequam regeneratus, 
est quod cupiditates et falsitates quae sunt externi hominis, continue{1} praedominentur, inde pugna; et cum regeneratus est, tunc internus homo dominatur super externum, hoc est, super ejus cupiditates 
et falsitates; cum dominatur internus homo, tunc est homini timor pro malis et terror pro falsis; nam tam mala quam falsa sunt contra conscientiam, et agere contra conscientiam ei est horror. 
 [2] Sed internus homo non timet mala nec{2} terretur pro falsis, sed externus; quare hic dicitur quod 'timor vestri et terror vestri super omnem bestiam terrae et omnem avem caeli,' hoc est, super omnes 
cupiditates, quae per 'bestiam' significantur, et super falsitates, quae per 'avem caeli': hic timor et hic terror apparet sicut hominis, sed ita se res habet; sunt apud unumquemvis hominem, ut prius 
dictum, ad minimum duo angeli per quos ei datur communicatio cum caelo; et duo spiritus mali per quos ei est communicatio cum inferno; cum angeli dominantur, ut fit apud hominem regeneratum, tunc 
spiritus mali qui adsunt, nihil quicquam hiscunt{3} agere contra bonum et verum quia tunc in vinculis sunt; cumque aliquid mali tentant agere aut falsum loqui, hoc est, excitare, tunc ilico in quodam 
timore et terrore infernali sunt; hic timor et hic terror est qui percipitur apud hominem pro iis quae sunt contra conscientiam; quare etiam, ut primum aliquid contra conscientiam agit et loquitur, in 
tentationem et in morsum conscientiae venit, hoc est, in cruciatum quendam quasi infernalem.  [3] Quod timor praedicetur de malis et terror de falsis, ita se habet; spiritus apud hominem non ita timent 
mala agere ac timent falsa loqui; homo enim per vera fidei renascitur et conscientiam accipit, quare non spiritibus licet falsa excitare: apud unumquemvis enim eorum non est nisi malum, ita, ut in 
malo sint, ipsa natura eorum, et inde omnis conatus eorum, est malum; et quia in malo sunt et eorum vita propria consistit in malo ignoscitur iis cum malum faciunt quando in aliquo usu sunt; sed falsum 
loqui non permittitur, causa est ut discant quid verum, et sic quantum possint, emendentur ut inserviant alicui vili usui; sed de his, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, plura in sequentibus.  Apud hominem 
regeneratum similiter; nam formatur ejus conscientia ex veris fidei; inde conscientia ejus est conscientia recti; ipsum malum vitae ei est falsum quia contra verum fidei: aliter apud hominem Antiquissimae 
Ecclesiae qui perceptionem habuit; is malum vitae percepit ut malum, et falsum fidei ut falsum. 	@1 continuo I.$ 	@2 et I.$ 	@3 In S's usage it seems that hiscere = anhelere, i.e., 'to pant, 
to be eager.' Cf. HH. 48, SD. 4471.$ </p>
