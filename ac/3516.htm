Verses 8-10. And now my son hearken unto my voice, according to that which I command thee. Go now to the flock, and take me from thence two good kids of the goats, and I will make them dainties for thy 
father, such as he loveth. And thou shalt bring to thy father, and he shall eat, that he may bless thee before his death. "And now my son hearken unto my voice, according to that which I command thee" 
signifies desire and delight perceived from the Divine truth in the Divine rational toward natural truth; "go now to the flock," signifies to natural domestic good not conjoined with the Divine rational; 
"and take me from thence two good kids of the goats," signifies the truths of this good; "and I will make them dainties for thy father, such as he loveth," signifies that he should make deliciousnesses 
therefrom; "and thou shalt bring to thy father, and he shall eat," signifies to the Divine good of the Divine rational, and appropriation; "that he may bless thee," signifies conjunction thereby; 
"before his death," signifies resuscitation in the natural. </p>

Verses 8-10 And now, my son, hearken to my voice, to what I command you. Go now to the flock, and take for me from there two good kids of the she-goats, and I will make them into savoury food for your 
father, such as he loves. And bring it to your father, and let him eat, so that he may bless you before his death. </p>
<p>'Now, my son, hearken to my voice, to what I command you' means the desire and pleasure 
perceived by Divine Truth within the Divine Rational towards natural truth. 'Go now to the flock' means to homeborn natural good that has not been joined to the Divine Rational 'And take for me 
from there two good kids of the she-goats' means truths born from that good. 'And I will make them into savoury food for your father, such as he loves' means that from these it will produce things that 
are delightful. 'And bring it to your father, and let him eat' means for the Divine Good of the Divine Rational, which makes those things its own. 'So that he may bless you' means conjunction thereby. 
'Before his death' means awakening in the natural. </p>

Vers. 8-10.  Et nunc, fili mi, ausculta voci meae, ad quod ego praecipio tibimet. Vade quaeso ad gregem, et accipe mihi exinde duos haedos caprarum bonos, et faciam illos cupedias patri tuo, quemadmodum 
amat. Et adducas patri tuo, et edat, propterea ut benedicat tibi ante mortem suam. `Nunc fili mi, ausculta voci meae, ad quod ego praecipio tibimet' significat desiderium et delectationem perceptam 
a Divino Vero in Divino Rationali erga verum naturale: `vade quaeso ad gregem' significat ad bonum naturale domesticum non conjunctum Divino Rationali: `et accipe mihi exinde duos haedos caprarum bonos' 
significat illius boni vera: `et faciam illos cupedias patri tuo, quemadmodum amat' significat quod inde delicias faciet: `et adducas patri tuo, et edat' significat Divino Bono Divini Rationalis, 
et appropriationem: `propterea ut benedicat tibi' significat conjunctionem sic: `ante mortem suam' significat resuscitationem in naturali. </p>
