<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5672节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5672.</strong>“等候约瑟晌午来”表直等内在与光明一同出现。这从这从“等到约瑟来”和“晌午”的含义，以及“约瑟”的代表清楚可知：“等到约瑟来”是指直等它出现；“约瑟”是指内在（参看<a href="5648.htm">5648</a>节）；“晌午”是指光明的状态（<a href="1458.htm">1458</a>，<a href="3195.htm">3195</a>，<a href="3708.htm">3708</a>节）。“晌午”之所以表示光明的状态，是因为一天的时辰，如早晨、中午、晚上对应于来世的光明状态；那里的光明状态是指聪明和智慧的状态，因为天堂之光含有聪明和智慧在里面。光明的这些状态变化就像世上一天的这些时辰，即早晨、中午、晚上。阴暗的状态则像晚上，但不是由于那里的太阳，也就是始终发光的主造成的，乃由天使自己的自我造成的。因为这种自我越是掌管他们的生活，他们就越进入阴暗或晚上的状态；相反，这种自我越是让位于天堂的自我，他们就越进入光明的状态。由此可见为何中午对应于光明的状态。</p>

Against Joseph came at noon. That this signifies until the internal should be present with light, is evident from the signification of "against he came" as being when it should be present; from the representation 
of Joseph, as being the internal (see n. 5648); and from the signification of "noon," as being a state of light (n. 1458, 3195, 3708). That "noon" denotes a state of light is because the 
times of day, as morning, noon, and evening, correspond to the enlightenments in the other life, and the enlightenments there are those of intelligence and wisdom, for in the light of heaven there is 
intelligence and wisdom. There are alternations of enlightenment there, like morning, noon, and evening on earth. The states of shade, like those of evening, do not arise from the sun there, that is, 
the Lord, who is always giving light, but from the angels' own, for insofar as they are let into their own they come into a state of shade or evening, and insofar as they are lifted out of their own 
into a heavenly own, they come into a state of light. From this it is plain why noon corresponds to a state of light. </p>

'Until Joseph's coming at midday' means up to when the internal would be present with light. This is clear from the meaning of 'until his coming' as up to when it was present; from the representation 
of 'Joseph' as the internal, dealt with in <a href="5648.htm">5648</a>; and from the meaning of 'midday' as a state of light, <a href="1458.htm">1458</a>, <a href="3195.htm">3195</a>, <a href="3708.htm">3708</a>.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> The reason 'midday' means a state of light is that the times of day, such as 
morning, midday, and evening, correspond to states of light in the next life; and states of light there are states of intelligence and wisdom, for the reason that the light of heaven holds intelligence 
and wisdom within it. The changing states of light there are like those times of day on earth - morning, midday, and evening. The states of shade akin to evening do not however have anything to do with 
the sun there, which is the Lord who is constantly shedding His light, but with the selfhood that is essentially the angels' own. For insofar as this selfhood takes over in their lives they pass into 
a state of shade or evening; but insofar as this selfhood gives way to the heavenly selfhood they move into a state of light. From this one may see where the correspondence of midday to a state of 
light has its origin.

`Usque  {1}venire  Joseph  in  meridie':  quod significet dum internum adesset cum luce, constat ex significatione `usque	  venire' quod sit {2}cum adesset; a repraesentatione `Josephi' quod  sit internum, 
de qua n. 5648; et ex significatione `meridiei' quod sit status lucis, de qua n. 1458, 3195, 3708; quod `meridies' sit status lucis, est quia tempora diei, sicut mane, meridies, vespera, correspondent 
illustrationibus in altera vita; et (x)illustrationes ibi sunt intelligentiae et sapientiae, nam in luce caeli est intelligentia et sapientia; vices illustrationis ibi sunt {3}tales, nempe sicut 
in terris mane, meridies, vespera; existunt status umbrae, sicut quae in vespera, non a sole ibi, hoc est, Domino, Qui semper lucet, sed a proprio angelorum, nam sicut in proprium suum immittuntur, 
ita in statum umbrae seu vesperae veniunt, et sicut a proprio suo in proprium caeleste elevantur, ita in statum lucis; inde patet unde est quod meridies correspondeat statui lucis. @1 see p. 258, ftnote
