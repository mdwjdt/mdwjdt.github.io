<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10684</strong>.出埃及记34:28-35.摩西在耶和华那里四十昼又四十夜；也不吃饭，也不喝水。他将这约的话，就是十句话，写在版上。于是，摩西从西乃山上下来，在从山上下来、两块法版在摩西手里的时候，摩西不知道在他与耶和华说话的时候，他的面皮发光。亚伦和以色列众人看见摩西，看哪，他的面皮发光；就怕挨近他。摩西叫他们来，于是亚伦和会众中所有的首领都回到他那里，摩西就与他们说话。随后，以色列众人都近前来，他就把耶和华在西乃山告诉他的一切话都吩咐他们。摩西与他们说完了话，就用帕子蒙上脸。每逢摩西进到耶和华面前与祂说话的时候，就揭去帕子，直到他出来为止；他出来，便将所吩咐的告诉以色列人。以色列人看见摩西的脸，他的面皮正发光，摩西又用帕子蒙上脸，直到他进去与耶和华说话。<br />“摩西在耶和华那里四十昼又四十夜”表在教会、敬拜和圣言在一个内在层面上存在之前的试探。“也不吃饭，也不喝水”表在此期间爱之良善和信之真理不会变成一个人自己的。“他将这约的话写在版上”表圣言，天堂通过圣言与人结合。“就是十句话”表它里面的一切神之真理。“于是，摩西从西乃山上下来”表内在之物进入圣言、教会和敬拜所取的外在形式的流注。“（在从山上下来）两块法版在摩西手里的时候”表圣言的一个代表。“摩西不知道在他与耶和华说话的时候，他的面皮发光”表圣言的内在在其外在里面闪耀，而外在却没有发觉。“亚伦和以色列众人看见摩西”表那些兴趣在于没有内在事物的教会、敬拜和圣言的外在事物之人的一个发现。“看哪，他的面皮发光”表内在之物通过外在之物闪耀。“就怕挨近他”表他们无法忍受像这样的一个教会、敬拜和圣言的外在形式。“摩西叫他们来”表这个民族靠近外在形式。“于是亚伦和会众中所有的首领都回到他那里”表那些兴趣在于没有内在事物的外在事物，然而又代表内在事物之人当中的首要人物。“摩西就与他们说话”表教导。“随后，以色列众人都近前来”表所有兴趣在于没有内在事物的外在事物，然而又代表内在事物的人。“他就把耶和华在西乃山告诉他的一切话都吩咐他们”表关于从天上所揭示、将要被代表的首要真理的一个命令。“摩西与他们说完了话”表关于将以外在形式来代表的首要真理的教导发出之后。“就用帕子蒙上脸”表教会、敬拜和圣言所取的内在形式并未显现给以色列民族，只向他们显现了没有内在的外在。“每逢摩西进到耶和华面前与祂说话的时候”表当来自主的内在之物流入外在之物，并且外在之物接受指示时，外在之物的状态。“就揭去帕子，直到他出来为止”表那时的一种光照的状态。“他出来，便将所吩咐的告诉以色列人”表向那些兴趣在于没有内在之物的外在事物之人传达他通过内在之物所接受的指示。“以色列人看见摩西的脸，他的面皮正发光”表诚然，以色列民族承认圣言里面有某种内在之物，但他们不想知道它的性质。“摩西又用帕子蒙上脸”表因此，内在事物向他们关闭。“直到他进去与耶和华说话”表即便他们接受教导。</p>

Verse 28, to the end. And he was there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights; he did not eat bread, and he did not drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten words. 
And it was, as Moses went down from Mount Sinai, and the two tables of the Testimony in Moses' hand as he went down from the mountain, that Moses knew not that the skin of his faces shone when he spoke 
with Him. And Aaron and all the sons of Israel saw Moses, and behold the skin of his faces shone; and they feared to come near unto him. And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the princes 
in the assemblage returned unto him; and Moses spoke unto them. And afterward all the sons of Israel came near, and he commanded them all things that Jehovah had spoken with him in Mount Sinai. And Moses 
left off from speaking with them, and he put a veil upon his faces. And when Moses entered in before Jehovah to speak with Him, he removed the veil until he went out; and he went out, and spoke unto 
the sons of Israel that which was commanded; and the sons of Israel saw the faces of Moses, that the skin of Moses' faces shone; and Moses drew back the veil upon his faces until he entered in to speak 
with Him. "And he was there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights" signifies temptations before there is any internal of the church, of worship, and of the Word; "he did not eat bread, and he 
did not drink water" signifies meanwhile there is no appropriation of the good of love and truth of faith; "and he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant" signifies the Word, through which there 
is the conjunction of heaven with man; "the Ten Words" signifies all truths Divine therein; "and it was, as Moses went down from Mount Sinai" signifies the influx of the internal into the external 
of the Word, of the church, and of worship; "and the two tables of the Testimony in Moses' hand" signifies a representative of the Word; "that Moses knew not that the skin of his faces shone when he 
spoke with Him" signifies the internal of the Word shining forth in its external without the external perceiving it; "and Aaron and all the sons of Israel saw Moses" signifies a noticing by those who 
are in the external things of the church, of worship, and of the Word without the internal things; "and behold the skin of his faces shone" signifies that the internal shines forth through the external; 
"and they feared to come near unto him" signifies that they could not endure the external of the church, of worship, and of the Word when it was of this character; "and Moses called unto them" signifies 
the approach of that nation to what is external; "and Aaron and all the princes in the assemblage returned unto him" signifies the chief of those who were in external things without internal things, 
and yet represented internal things; "and Moses spoke unto them" signifies instruction; "and afterward all the sons of Israel came near" signifies all who were in external things without internal 
things and yet represented internal things; "and he commanded them all things that Jehovah had spoken with him in Mount Sinai" signifies a command concerning the primary truths which were to be represented 
as revealed from heaven; "and Moses left off from speaking with them" signifies after information concerning the primary truths which were to be represented in external things; "and he put a veil 
upon his faces" signifies that the internal of the church, of worship, and of the Word did not appear to the Israelitish nation, but only the external without the internal; "and when Moses entered 
in before Jehovah to speak with Him" signifies the state of the external when the internal from the Lord flowed in, and the external received information; "he removed the veil until he went out" signifies 
a state of enlightenment then; "and he went out, and spoke unto the sons of Israel that which was commanded" signifies communication with those who are in external things without what is internal 
concerning those things about which he was informed through the internal; "and the sons of Israel saw the faces of Moses, that the skin of Moses' faces shone" signifies that the Israelitish nation did 
indeed acknowledge that there is an internal in the Word, but that they did not wish to know the nature of it; "and Moses drew back the veil upon his faces" signifies that for this reason internal things 
were closed to them; "until he entered in to speak with him" signifies no matter how much they may be informed. </p>

Verses 28-end  And he was there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights; he did not eat bread and he did not drink water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten words. And so 
it was, when Moses came down from Mount Sinai (and the two tablets of the Testimony were in Moses' hand when he came down from the mountain), that Moses did not know that the skin of his face gleamed 
while he talked to Him. And Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, and behold, the skin of his face gleamed; and they were afraid to approach him. And Moses called to them, and Aaron and all 
the princes in the assembly turned back to him, and Moses talked to them. And afterwards all the children of Israel approached, and he commanded them all the things that Jehovah had told him on Mount 
Sinai. And Moses finished talking to them, and he put a veil over his face. And whenever Moses went in before Jehovah to talk to Him he took the veil off until he was going to come out; and he came out 
and told the children of Israel what had been commanded. And the children of Israel saw Moses' face, that the skin of Moses' face was gleaming, and Moses drew the veil back over his face, until he 
went in to talk to Him. </p>
<p>'And he was with Jehovah forty days and forty nights' means temptations before the Church, worship, and the Word exist on an internal level. 'He did not eat bread and he did 
not drink water' means during which the good of love and the truth of faith do not become a person's own. 'And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant' means the Word, through which heaven 
is joined to a person. 'The ten words' means all God's truths within it. 'And so it was, when Moses came down from Mount Sinai' means the flow of what is inward into the outward form that the Word, the 
Church, and worship take. 'And the two tablets of the Testimony were in Moses' hand' means a representative sign of the Word. 'That Moses did not know that the skin of his face gleamed while he talked 
to Him' means the inward level or aspect of the Word within the outward, shining forth without any perception of it by the outward. 'And Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses' means what is 
discerned by those whose interest lies in things of the Church, worship, and the Word on an outward level devoid of those on the inward level. 'And behold, the skin of his face gleamed' means that what 
is inward shines forth through what is outward. 'And they were afraid to approach him' means that they could not bear an outward form of the Church, worship, and the Word such as this. 'And Moses 
called to them' means the approach of that nation to the outward form. 'And Aaron and all the princes in the assembly turned back to him' means the chief ones among those who, although their interest 
lay in things on an outward level devoid of those on an inward level, would nevertheless represent those on an inward level. 'And Moses talked to them' means instruction. 'And afterwards all the children 
of Israel approached' means all who, although their interest lay in things on an outward level devoid of what was inward, would nevertheless represent those things on an inward level. 'And he commanded 
them all the things that Jehovah had told him on Mount Sinai' means a decree relating to the primary truths revealed from heaven that were to be represented. 'And Moses finished talking to them' 
means after the instructions regarding the primary truths which were to be represented in outward forms had been delivered. 'And he put a veil over his face' means that the inward form which the Church, 
worship, and the Word take was not visible to the Israelite nation, only the outward without the inward. 'And whenever Moses went in before Jehovah to talk to Him' means the state of what was outward 
when what was inward from the Lord flowed into it and it received instructions. 'He took the veil off until he was going to come out' means a state of enlightenment then. 'And he came out and told 
the children of Israel what had been commanded' means communicating to those whose interest lies in things on an outward level devoid of what is inward, regarding instructions which he had received through 
what was inward. 'And the children of Israel saw Moses' face, that the skin of Moses' face was gleaming' means that the Israelite nation did, it is true, acknowledge the presence in the Word of 
something inward, but that they had no wish to know the nature of it. 'And Moses drew the veil back over his face' means that therefore inward things were closed off from them. 'Until he went in to talk 
to Him' means even though they were receiving instructions.  </p>

Vers. 28-finem.  Et fuit ibi cum Jehovah quadraginta dies et quadraginta noctes; panem non edit et aquam non bibit; et scripsit super tabulis verba foederis, decem verba.  Et fuit in descendendo Moscheh 
de monte Sinai, et duae tabulae testimonii in manu Moschis in descendendo illo de monte, et Moscheh non novit quod coruscaret cutis facierum ejus in loquendo illo cum (x)Ipso.  Et vidit Aharon et 
omnes filii Israelis Moschen, et ecce coruscavit cutis facierum ejus, et timebant ab accedere ad illum.  Et vocavit ad illos Moscheh, et reversi sunt ad illum Aharon, et omnes (x)principes in coetu, 
et locutus Moscheh ad illos.  Et postea accesserunt omnes filii Israelis, et praecepit illis omnia quae locutus Jehovah cum illo in monte Sinai.  Et absolvit Moscheh a loquendo cum illis, et dedit super 
facies suas velamen.  Et in intrando Mosche coram Jehovah ad loquendum cum Ipso, removit velamen usque ad exire illum; et exivit et locutus ad filios Israelis id quod praeceptum est.  Et viderunt filii 
Israelis facies Moschis, quod coruscaret cutis facierum Moschis, et reduxit Moscheh velamen super facies suas usque ad intrare illum ad loquendum cum Ipso.  `Et fuit cum Jehovah quadraginta dies 
et quadraginta noctes' significat tentationes antequam internum Ecclesiae, cultus, et Verbi datur:  `panem non edit et aquam non bibit' significat interea non appropriationem boni amoris et veri fidei: 
 `et scripsit super tabulis verba foederis' significat Verbum, per quod conjunctio caeli cum homine:  `decem verba' significat omnia vera Divina inibi:  `et fuit in descendendo Mosche de monte Sinai' 
significat influxum interni in externum Verbi, Ecclesiae, et cultus:  `et duae tabulae testimonii in manu Moschis' significat repraesentativum Verbi:  `et Moscheh non novit quod coruscaret cutis facierum 
ejus in loquendo illo cum Ipso' significat internum Verbi in externo ejus elucens absque quod externum percipiat:  `et vidit Aharon et omnes filii Israelis Moschen' significat apperceptionem illorum 
qui in externis Ecclesiae, cultus, et Verbi absque internis:  `et ecce coruscavit cutis facierum ejus' significat quod internum eluceat per externum:  `et timebant ab accedere ad illum' significat 
quod non sustinerent externum Ecclesiae, cultus, et Verbi, cum tale:  `et vocavit ad illos Moscheh' significat accessionem illius gentis ad externum:  `et reversi sunt ad illum Aharon et omnes principes 
in coetu' significat praecipuos qui in externis absque internis, et usque repraesentarent interna:  `et locutus Moscheh ad illos' significat instructionem:  `et postea accesserunt omnes filii Israelis' 
significat omnes qui in externis absque internis, et usque repraesentarent interna:  `et praecepit illis omnia quae locutus Jehovah cum illo in monte Sinai' significat mandatum de (x)primariis 
veris quae repraesentanda revelata e caelo:  `et absolvit Moscheh a loquendo cum illis' significat post informationem de primariis veris quae in externis repraesentanda:  `et dedit super facies suas velamen' 
significat quod internum Ecclesiae, cultus, et Verbi non apparuerit genti Israeliticae, sed modo externum absque interno:  `et in intrando Mosche coram Jehovah ad loquendum cum Ipso' significat 
statum externi cum influeret internum a Domino et reciperet informationem:  `removit velamen usque ad exire illum' significat statum illustrationis tunc:  `et exivit, et locutus ad filios Israelis id 
quod praeceptum est' significat communicationem cum illis qui in externis absque interno sunt, de illis de quibus per internum informatus:  `et viderunt filii Israelis facies Moschis, quod coruscaret 
cutis facierum Moschis' significat quod gens Israelitica quidem agnosceret in Verbo dari internum, sed non {1}velit scire quale id:  `et reduxit Moscheh velamen super facies suas' significat quod ideo 
interna illis occluderentur:  `usque ad intrare illum ad loquendum cum Ipso' significat utcumque informentur. @1 velint IT$ </p>
