<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5913节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5913.</strong>“连羊群、牛群”表属世良善，无论内层的还是外层的。这从“羊群”和“牛群”的含义清楚可知：“羊群”是指内层良善（参看<a href="2566.htm">2566</a>节），在此是指内层属世良善，因为它们是以色列的羊群，而以色列代表来自属世层的属灵良善（<a href="5906.htm">5906</a>节）；“牛群”是指外层属世良善。之所以“牛群”表示外层良善，“羊群”表示内层良善，是因为构成牛群的牲畜，如公牛和小公牛，当用来祭祀时，表示外在的仁之良善，以及外在人的良善。而构成羊群的牲畜，如羔羊、绵羊和山羊，表示内在的仁之良善，以及内在人的良善。故在圣言中，处于这后一类良善的人用一个词，即“羊群”来称谓，引导他们的人被称为“牧人”。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5913</b></p><p><b>5913.</b>
And thy flocks, and thy herds. That this signifies natural good interior and exterior, is evident from the signification of "flock," as being interior good (see n. 2566), here interior natural good, 
because they were the flocks of Israel, by whom is represented spiritual good from the natural (n. 5906); and from the signification of "herd," as being exterior natural good. That by "herd" is signified 
exterior good, and by "flocks" interior good, is because the beasts which constituted the herd, as oxen and bullocks, in the sacrifices signified the external goods of charity, also the goods of the 
external man; but those which constituted the flocks, as lambs, sheep, and goats, signified the internal goods of charity, also the goods of the internal man; and therefore they who are in these latter 
goods are called in the Word by the one word "flock," and he who leads them is called the "shepherd." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5913</b></p><p><b>5913.</b>
'And your flocks, and your herds' means natural good, interior and exterior. This is clear from the meaning of 'flock' as interior good, dealt with in <a href="2566.htm">2566</a>, in this case interior natural good since the 
flocks belonged to Israel, who represents spiritual good from the natural, <a href="5906.htm">5906</a>; and from the meaning of 'herd' as exterior natural good. The reason why 'herd' means exterior good and 'flocks' interior 
good is that the animals which constituted a herd, such as oxen and young bulls, were signs, when used in sacrifices, of external forms of the good of charity and also of the forms of good present 
in the external man. But the animals constituting flocks, such as lambs, sheep, she-goats, were signs of internal forms of the good of charity and also of the forms of good present in the internal man. 
Consequently people in whom these forms of good are present are referred to in the Word by the single term 'flock', and the one who leads them by the term 'pastor' or 'shepherd'. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 5913</b>
</p><b>5913.</b>
`Et greges tui, et armenta tua': quod significet bonum naturale interius et exterius, constat (c)a significatione `gregis' quod sit bonum interius, de qua n. 2566, hic bonum interius naturale, quia 
erant greges `Israelis' per quem repraesentatur bonum spirituale e naturali, n. 5906; et ex significatione `armenti' quod sit bonum exterius naturale. Quod per `armentum' significetur bonum exterius, 
et per `greges' interius, est quia bestiae quae constituebant armentum, ut boves et juvenci, in sacrificiis significabant bona charitatis externa, tum bona externi hominis; at quae constituebant greges, 
ut agni, oves, caprae, significabant bona charitatis interna, tum bona interni hominis; quare qui in his bonis sunt, in Verbo una voce vocantur `grex' et qui ducit illos `pastor'. </p>
