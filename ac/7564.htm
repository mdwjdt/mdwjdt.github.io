<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7564节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7564.</strong>“但那不把耶和华这话放在心上的”表并非来自主的事物。这从前面的解释（<a href="7562.htm">7562</a>节）清楚可知，在那里“惧怕耶和华这话的”表示属于主的事物；因此，另一方面，“那不把耶和华这话放在心上的”表示并非来自主的事物。良善和真理要么是属于主的，要么是不属于主的。人为他的邻舍和国家，以及教会和主的国度，因而为良善和真理本身，尤其为主所行的良善和真理是属于主的。这些良善和真理就是属于主的良善和真理；而不属于主的真理和良善则是人以自己为目的，以世界为目的所行的真理和良善。后者表面上有时看上去和前者很相似，但内里迥然不同；因为后者通向自我，而前者远离自我。人在不幸、患病、悲伤或恐惧的状态下，而非在自由状态下所行的，绝大部分也是不属于主的真理和良善；因为这些真理和良善也是为自我而行的。一切真理和良善的确都从主流入，但当人将主的良善和真理直接转向他自己时，它们就变成人的，属于那将它们直接转向自己的那一位，因为它们变成了爱自己爱世界的良善。这就是一切恶人为彼此所行的那种良善。由此可见，哪些良善和真理是属于主的良善和真理，哪些是不属于主的良善和真理。</p>

And he that did not set his heart unto the word of Jehovah. That this signifies the things which were not from the Lord, is evident from what was unfolded above (n. 7562), where "he that feared the word 
of Jehovah" signifies the things that were of the Lord; hence on the other hand "he that did not set his heart unto the word of Jehovah" signifies the things which are not from the Lord. Goods and 
truths are either of the Lord or not of the Lord. Those which are of the Lord are those which the man does for the sake of his neighbor, for the sake of his country, for the sake of the church, and for 
the sake of the Lord's kingdom, thus for the sake of good and truth itself, and especially for the sake of the Lord. These goods and truths are those which are of the Lord; but the truths and goods 
which are not of the Lord are those which a man does for the sake of himself as the end, and for the sake of the world as the end. These latter sometimes appear like the former in the outward form, but 
in the inward form they are quite different; for these lead to self, but those away from self. The truths and goods which are not of the Lord are also for the most part those which a man does in a 
state of misfortune, of sickness, of grief, and of fear, and not in a free state, for these also are for the sake of self. All truths and goods do indeed flow in from the Lord, but when the goods and 
truths of the Lord are bent with a man to himself, they then become the man's and belong to him to whom they are bent, for they become goods of the love of self and of the world. Such are the goods of 
all the evil among themselves. From all this it is evident what goods and truths are meant by those which are of the Lord, and by those which are not of the Lord. </p>

'And he that did not take the word of Jehovah to heart' means the things which were not from the Lord. This is clear from the explanation above in <a href="7562.htm">7562</a>, where 'he that feared the word of Jehovah' means 
the things that were the Lord's, and therefore conversely 'he that did not take the word of Jehovah to heart' means the things which were not from the Lord. Forms of good and truths are either the 
Lord's or not the Lord's. The Lord's are those which a person puts into practice for the sake of his neighbour, his country, the Church, and the Lord's kingdom, thus for the sake of truth and goodness 
themselves, and above all for the Lord's sake. These forms of good and truths are the ones that are the Lord's. But those that are not the Lord's are the ones which a person puts into practice for the 
sake of himself as his end in view, and for the sake of the world as his end in view. These latter forms of good and truths sometimes seem in outward appearance to be like the former; but inwardly they 
are totally different, for the latter lead to self, the former away from self. The truths and forms of good which are not the Lord's are also for the most part what a person puts into practice in 
a state of misfortune, sickness, grief, or fear, and not in a state of freedom; for these are also done for the sake of self. Every form of truth or good does indeed flow in from the Lord, but when a 
person turns the Lord's goodness or truth directly towards himself it becomes man's; it becomes the possession of him who turns it directly towards himself. For it becomes the good of self-love and love 
of the world. This is the kind of good that all evil people do to one another. From all this one may see which forms of good and truths are meant by forms of good and truths that are the Lord's and 
by forms of good and truths that are not the Lord's. </p>

`Et qui non posuit cor [suum] ad verbum Jehovae': quod significet quae non a Domino, constat ex illis quae supra n. 7562 explicata sunt, ubi `timens verbum Jehovae' significat quae Domini erant; inde 
{1}vicissim `qui non posuit cor ad verbum Jehovae' {2}significat quae non a Domino.  Bona et vera sunt vel Domini vel non Domini; quae Domini sunt illa quae homo facit propter proximum, propter patriam, 
propter Ecclesiam, propter regnum Domini, ita propter ipsum verum et bonum, et imprimis propter Dominum; haec bona et vera sunt quae Domini; at {3}vera et bona quae non Domini sunt quae homo facit 
propter se ut finem, et propter mundum ut finem; haec quandoque apparent in externa forma sicut illa, sed in interna prorsus differunt; nam haec ducunt ad se, illa vero a se; {4}vera et bona quae non 
Domini {5} sunt quoque quoad plurem partem quae homo facit in statu infortunii, aegritudinis, doloris, et timoris, et non in statu libero, nam {6}haec sunt quoque propter se; omnia quidem vera et bona 
influunt a Domino, sed quando bona et vera Domini flectuntur apud hominem ad se, tunc fiunt illa hominis, et ejus propria ad quem flectuntur, nam fiunt bona amoris sui {7}et mundi; {8}talia bona sunt 
omnium malorum inter se;(n) ex his patet quae bona et vera {9}intelliguntur per bona et vera Domini et per bona et vera quae non Domini. 	@1 est quod$ 	@2 sint$ 	@3 bona et vera$ 	@4 et quoque 
bona et vera$ 	@5 i sunt,$ 	@6 d haec i ea$ 	@7 aut amoris$ 	@8 avertuntur sic a Domino ad hominem et fiunt propria ejus ad quem vertuntur$ 	@9 intelligantur$ </p>
