<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第44节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>44.</strong>创世记1:24-25 神说：“地要生出活物来，各从其类；牲畜、昆虫、走兽，各从其类。”事就这样成了。于是神造出走兽，各从其类；牲畜，各从其类；地上一切昆虫，各从其类。神看着是好的。<br />人好比一块地，要结出善果，得先种下信仰知识，让他了解当信什么、做什么。觉性的功能是聆听圣言，意志的功能是实践圣言。光听不行，就如自称信，却不照之而行。此等人将信与行分开，使心智分裂，被主称为“无知的人”：“凡听见我这话就去行的，好比一个聪明人，把房子盖在磐石上……凡听见我这话不去行的，好比一个无知的人，把房子盖在沙土上。”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.24.htm">7:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.26.htm">26</a>）<br />如前面所说，觉性所得的见解，以“水中能行动的活物”和“空中的飞鸟”为象征。此处，意志所发的善愿，以“地上生出的活物”、“牲畜”、“昆虫”、“走兽”为象征。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]44.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_44/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_24-25" target=_top>Genesis 1:24-25</a>. And God said, "Let the earth produce each living soul according to its kind: the beast, and that which moves, and the wild animal of the earth, each according to its kind;" and so it was done. And God made each wild animal of the earth according to its kind, and each beast according to its kind, and every animal creeping on the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.<br />Like the earth, we are unable to produce any good unless we have first been sown with religious insights, which enable us to see what to believe and do.<br />The role of the intellect is to hear the Word, while the role of the will is to do it. To hear the Word and not act is to claim we believe it although we do not live by it. People who act like this separate the two and split their minds. The Lord says they are stupid:<br />Everyone who hears my words and does them I compare to a prudent man who built his house on rock. But everyone who hears my words and does not do them I compare to a stupid man who built his house on sand. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_44/bible_king-james-version_matthew_7_24" target=_top>Matthew 7:24</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_44/bible_king-james-version_matthew_7_26" target=_top>26</a>)<br />What the intellect grasps is symbolized, as shown [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_44/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_40" target=_top>40</a>], by creeping animals that the waters cause to creep out and birds flying over the land and over the face of the expanse. What the will is intent on is symbolized by the living soul that the earth is to produce, by the beast and that which creeps, and by the wild animal of the earth. </p>

Verses 24, 25. And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living soul after its kind, the beast, and the moving thing, and the wild animal of the earth after its kind; and it was so. And God made the 
wild animal of the earth after its kind, and the beast after its kind, and everything that creepeth on the ground after its kind; and God saw that it was good. Man, like the earth, can produce nothing 
of good unless the knowledges of faith are first sown in him, whereby he may know what is to be believed and done. It is the office of the understanding to hear the Word, and of the will to do it. 
To hear the Word and not to do it, is like saying that we believe when we do not live according to our belief; in which case we separate hearing and doing, and thus have a divided mind, and become of 
those whom the Lord calls "foolish" in the following passage: </p>
<p>     Whosoever heareth My words, and doeth them, I will liken unto a wise man who built his house upon a rock: but everyone that heareth 
My words, and doeth them not, I liken to a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand (Matt. 7:24, 26).The things that belong to the understanding are signified-as before shown-by the "creeping things 
which the waters bring forth" and also by the "fowl upon the earth" and "upon the faces of the expanse;" but those which are of the will are signified here by the "living soul which the earth produces" 
and by the "beast" and "creeping thing" and also by the "wild animal of that earth." </p>

Verses 24, 25 And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds, beasts and creeping things and wild animals of the earth according to their kinds; and it was so. And 
God made wild animals of the earth according to their kinds, and beasts according to their kinds, and everything that creeps along the ground according to its kind; and God saw that it was good.  </p>
<p>Man, 
like the earth, can produce nothing good unless the cognitions of faith have already been sown in him enabling him to know what to believe and do. It is the function of the understanding to hear the 
Word, and of the will to do it. A person who hears the Word and does not do it is one who claims to believe, but he does not live according to it. Such a person separates hearing and doing, and splits 
his mind in two directions; and by the Lord he is called 'a foolish man',  </p>
<blockquote>
Everyone who hears My words and does them I liken to a wise man who built his house upon the rock; but everyone who hears 
My words and does them not I liken to a foolish man who built his house upon the sand. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%207:24,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 7:24, 26</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Matters of the understanding, as has been shown, are meant by 'creeping things which the 
waters produce', and by 'birds over the earth and over the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the expanse'. Matters of the will are here meant by 'living creatures which the earth brings forth', and by 'beasts and creeping things', 
and also by 'the wild animals of the earth'.

Vers. 24, 25.  Et dixit Deus, Producat terra animam viventem secundum speciem suam; bestiam et {1} se movens, et feram istius terrae secundum speciem suam; et factum ita. Et fecit Deus feram terrae 
secundum speciem suam, et bestiam secundum speciem suam, et omne {2} reptans humi secundum speciem suam: et vidit Deus quod bonum. Homo, sicut 'terra,' nihil boni producere potest nisi prius ei inseminatae 
sint cognitiones fidei ex quibus sciat quid credendum et faciendum: intellectus est audire Verbum, et voluntatis est facere; audire Verbum et non facere, est dicere quod credat, et tamen non ita 
vivit; talis separat illa et distrahit mentem, et a Domino vocatur 'stultus,' Omnis, qui audit verba Mea, et facit illa, comparo viro prudenti, qui aedificavit domum suam supra petram; at omnis, qui 
audit verba Mea, sed non facit illa, comparo viro stulto, qui aedificavit domum suam super arenam, Matth. vii 24, 26. Quae sunt intellectus, significata sunt, ut ostensum, per 'reptilia, quae aquae 
prorepere faciunt, et per avem super terra et super faciebus expansi'; quae sunt voluntatis, significantur hic per 'animam viventem quam terra producat,' perque 'bestiam et reptans,' tum per 'feram ejus 
terrae.' </p>
<p>@  1 Heb. has     (remes) in both these places, Sch. has 'reptile'; below in this   S. seems to combine the terms in reptans.$ </p>
