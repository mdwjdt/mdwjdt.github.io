Verses 27-31. And Jehovah said unto Aaron, Go to meet Moses, into the wilderness. And he went and met him in the mountain of God, and kissed him. And Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah, wherewith 
He had sent him, and all the signs which He had commanded him. And Moses went, and Aaron, and gathered together all the elders of the sons of Israel; and Aaron spoke all the words which Jehovah had 
spoken unto Moses, and did the signs before the eyes of the people. And the people believed; and they heard that Jehovah had visited the sons of Israel, and that He had seen their affliction, and they 
bent themselves, and bowed themselves down. "And Jehovah said unto Aaron," signifies the truth of doctrine, and perception therein from the Divine; "Go to meet Moses," signifies that it should be conjoined 
with the truth proceeding immediately from the Divine; "into the wilderness," signifies where previously it is not so; "and he went, and met him in the mountain of God," signifies conjunction 
in the good of love therein; "and kissed him," signifies the affection of conjunction; "and Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah," signifies the influx of the truth proceeding immediately from the 
Divine of the Lord into the truth which proceeds mediately, and instruction in the details of doctrine; "wherewith He had sent him," signifies which proceed; "and all the signs which He had commanded 
him," signifies enlightenment and from this at the same time confirmation; "and Moses went, and Aaron," signifies the life of the conjunction of both; "and gathered together all the elders of the sons 
of Israel," signifies the chief things of wisdom pertaining to the spiritual church; "and Aaron spoke all the words which Jehovah had spoken unto Moses," signifies doctrine thence from the Divine; 
"and did the signs before the eyes of the people," signifies confirmation to apprehension; "and the people believed, and they heard," signifies faith and hope; "that Jehovah had visited the sons of Israel," 
signifies that those who are of the spiritual church would be liberated and saved by the coming of the Lord; "and that He had seen their affliction," signifies after temptations so great; "and 
they bent themselves and bowed themselves down," signifies humiliation. </p>

Verses 27-31 And Jehovah said to Aaron, Go to meet Moses, to the wilderness. And he went, and he came to meet him in the mountain of God, and kissed him. And Moses told Aaron all Jehovah's words with 
which He had sent him, and all the signs which He had commanded him. And Moses and Aaron went, and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel. And Aaron spoke all the words which Jehovah 
had spoken to Moses, and did the signs before the eyes of the people. And the people believed, and heard that Jehovah had visited the children of Israel, and that He had seen their affliction; and 
they bowed, and bowed down. </p>
<p>'And Jehovah said to Aaron' means the truth presented by doctrinal teachings and perception from the Divine within it. 'Go to meet Moses' means that it was to be joined 
to truth going forth directly from the Divine. 'To the wilderness' means a situation prior to that in which no such thing exists. 'And he went, and he came to meet him in the mountain of God' means a 
joining together within the good of love there. 'And kissed him' means the affection belonging to the joining together. 'And Moses told Aaron all Jehovah's words' means an influx of truth going forth 
directly from the Lord's Divine into truth that goes forth in an indirect way, and instruction in specific doctrinal teachings. 'With which He had sent him' means which go forth. 'And all the signs which 
He had commanded him' means enlightenment together with corroboration as a result of that enlightenment. 'And Moses and Aaron went' means the life of both when joined together. 'And gathered together 
all the elders of the children of Israel' means the chief characteristics of wisdom that the spiritual Church possessed. 'And Aaron spoke all the words which Jehovah had spoken to Moses' means doctrinal 
teachings received thereby from the Divine. 'And did the signs before the eyes of the people' means a corroboration suited to the ability to grasp things. 'And the people believed, and heard' 
means faith and hope. 'That Jehovah had visited the children of Israel' means those who belonged to the spiritual Church - [their faith and hope] that they would be delivered and saved by the Lord's Coming. 
'And that He had seen their affliction' means after such great temptations. 'And they bowed, and bowed down' means humility. </p>

Vers. 27-31.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Aharonem, Vade obviam Moschi desertum; et ivit, et occurrit illi in monte Dei, et osculatus illum.  Et indicavit Moscheh Aharoni omnia verba Jehovae, quibus misit illum, 
et omnia signa quae praecepit illi.  Et ivit Moscheh et Aharon, et congregaverunt omnes seniores filiorum Israelis.  Et locutus Aharon omnia verba quae locutus Jehovah ad Moschen, et fecit signa 
ad oculos populi.  Et credidit populus, et audiverunt quod visitaverit Jehovah filios Israelis, et quod viderit afflictionem illorum; et inflexerunt se et incurvaverunt se.  `Et dixit Jehovah ad Aharonem' 
significat verum doctrinae et ibi perceptionem a Divino: `Vade obviam Moschi' significat quod conjungeretur cum vero immediate a Divino procedente: `desertum' significat ubi non ita prius est: `et 
ivit, et occurrit illi in monte Dei' significat conjunctionem in bono amoris ibi: `et osculatus illum' significat affectionem conjunctionis: `et indicavit Moscheh Aharoni omnia verba Jehovae' significat 
influxum veri immediate procedentis a Divino Domini in verum quod mediate procedit, et instructionem in singulis doctrinae: `quibus misit illum' significat quae procedunt: `et omnia signa quae praecepit 
illi' significat illustrationem et inde confirmationem simul: `et ivit Moscheh et Aharon' significat vitam conjunctionis utriusque: `et congregarunt omnes seniores filiorum Israelis' significat 
praecipua sapientiae quae Ecclesiae spirituali: `et locutus Aharon omnia verba quae locutus Jehovah ad Moschen' significat doctrinam inde a Divino: `et fecit signa ad oculos populi' significat confirmationem 
ad captum: `et credidit populus, et audiverunt' significat fidem et spem: `quod visitaverit Jehovah filios Israelis' significat illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, quod liberarentur et salvarentur 
per Adventum Domini: `et quod viderit afflictionem illorum' significat post tantas tentationes: `et inflexerunt se et incurvaverunt se' significat humiliationem. </p>
