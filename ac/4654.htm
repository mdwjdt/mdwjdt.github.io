<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4654节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4654.</strong>有些灵人曾与我同在，当我的思维指向诸如属于天意的那类事物时，尤其当我正在思考没有按照我所期待和渴望的那样到来、因而令人恼火的事时，他们就强有力地进入我的思维。天使说，这些灵人就是那些活在肉身时因没有得到自己所祈求的东西而恼火，并因此对天意产生怀疑的人。不过，一旦从这种状态出来，他们就会按别人告知的那样过虔诚的生活，从而过简单顺从的生活。我被告知，这类灵人属于外耳或耳廓的区域，并且当他们向我说话时，我也在那里实际看到他们。</p>

There were spirits with me who flowed in very strongly into my thought when it was exercised upon such things as were of Providence, and especially when I was thinking that the things I awaited and desired 
were not coming to pass. The angels said that they were spirits who when they lived in the body and prayed for anything and did not obtain it were indignant, and gave way to doubts concerning Providence, 
and yet when out of this state they acted piously as told to do by others, and were thus in simple obedience. It was said that such belong to the province of the external ear or auricle, and 
they also appeared there when they spoke with me. </p>

Some spirits were once present with me who were entering with great force into my thought when this was directed towards such things as were matters of Providence, in particular when I was thinking about 
things not fuming out as I expected or desired. Angels told me that these spirits were ones who during their lifetime had been annoyed when they did not get something they had prayed for, and had 
on that account entertained doubts regarding Providence. But apart from this state they had led devout lives, doing what others told them to do, and so led lives of simple obedience. I was told that 
such spirits belong to the province of the outer ear or auricle, where I also actually saw them when they spoke to me. </p>

Erant spiritus apud me qui admodum fortiter influebant in cogitationem cum agebatur de talibus quae essent Providentiae, imprimis quando cogitabam quod non evenirent quae exspectabam et cupiebam 
{1}; dicebatur ab angelis quod essent spiritus qui dum vixerunt in corpore et precati de aliqua re et non obtinuerunt, quod indignati {2}sint, et in dubitationem de Providentia se eapropter {3}induxerint; 
sed usque, cum essent extra illum statum, quod pietatem exercuerint secundum id quod alii dixerunt, ita quod in simplici oboedientia fuerint: dictum quod tales ad provinciam auris externae 
seu auriculae pertineant; etiam ibi apparuerunt cum locuti sunt mecum.      @1 i, et tunc aliquoties anxietates excitabant$      @2 sunt$      @3 induxerunt$ </p>
