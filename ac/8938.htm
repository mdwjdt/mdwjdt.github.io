<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8938节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8938.</strong>“凡记下我名的各个地方”表每个人对主的信之状态。这从“地方”的含义清楚可知，“地方”是指状态（参看<a href="2625.htm">2625</a>，<a href="2837.htm">2837</a>，<a href="3356.htm">3356</a>，<a href="3387.htm">3387</a>，<a href="3404.htm">3404</a>，<a href="4321.htm">4321</a>，<a href="4882.htm">4882</a>，<a href="5605.htm">5605</a>，<a href="7381.htm">7381</a>节），因此，“各个地方”是指每个人的状态，或与每个人同在的状态。之所以表示信的状态，是因为“耶和华的名”表示整体上藉以敬拜主的一切事物，因而表示信和仁的一切事物（<a href="2724.htm">2724</a>，<a href="3006.htm">3006</a>，<a href="6674.htm">6674</a>节）。所以，“记下耶和华神的名”表示来自主的仁和信与其同在或在其心里的那个人（里面的状态）。字面上的意思是，他们要在耶路撒冷献燔祭和感谢祭，因而献上他们羊群和牛群；耶路撒冷是耶和华为他们所选的敬拜祂的地方，也是“祂记下祂名的”地方。然而，根据内义，所指的不是地方，而是有仁和信在里面的每个人；因为“地方”在内义上不是指地方，而是指状态；“名字”也不是指名字，而是指信仰和敬拜；因此所指的是一个处于从主接受信的一种状态的人。此外，在耶路撒冷，就是通过燔祭和感谢祭来敬拜主的地方，教会的一切都具有代表性。这就是为何圣言中的“耶路撒冷”和启示录中的“新耶路撒冷”表示主的教会；主的教会存在于每一个处于从主接受仁与信的一种状态的人中。因为一个人本身就是一个教会，而有教会在其中的许多人则组成总体上的教会。由此也明显可知，“凡记下我名的各个地方”表示每个人的信之状态。</p>

In every place where I shall put the memory of My name. That this signifies a state of faith in the Lord with everyone, is evident from the signification of "place," as being state (see n. 2625, 2837, 
3356, 3387, 3404, 4321, 4882, 5605, 7381); thus "every place" denotes the state of everyone, or with everyone. That a state of faith is signified, is because the "name of Jehovah" signifies everything 
in one complex by which the Lord is worshiped, thus all things of faith and charity (n. 2724, 3006, 6674); consequently "to put the memory of the name of Jehovah God" denotes with whom, or in whose 
heart, are charity and faith from the Lord. It is according to the sense of the letter that they were to sacrifice burnt-offerings and thank-offerings, thus their flocks and their herds, in Jerusalem, 
which was the place chosen by the Lord for the worship of Himself, thus in which He put the memory of His name. According to the internal sense, however, place is not meant, but every man in whom are 
faith and charity; for in the internal sense by "place" is not signified place, but state; neither by "name" is there signified name, but faith and worship; thus there is meant the man who is in a state 
of reception of faith from the Lord. Moreover in Jerusalem, which was the place where the Lord was worshiped by burnt-offerings and thank-offerings, were represented all things that belong to the 
church. Consequently by "Jerusalem" in the Word, and by the "New Jerusalem" in Revelation, is signified the church of the Lord; and the church of the Lord is with everyone who is in a state of reception 
of charity and faith from the Lord; for a man is himself a church, and a number in whom is the church make the church in general. Hence it is also evident that by "in every place in which I put the 
memory of My name" is signified a state of faith with everyone. </p>

'In every place where I shall put the memory of My name' means the state of faith [in the Lord] with each individual person. This is clear from the meaning of 'place' as state, dealt with in <a href="2625.htm">2625</a>, <a href="2837.htm">2837</a>, <a href="3356.htm">3356</a>, <a href="3387.htm">3387</a>, <a href="3404.htm">3404</a>, <a href="4321.htm">4321</a>, <a href="4882.htm">4882</a>, <a href="5605.htm">5605</a>, <a href="7381.htm">7381</a>, so that 'every place' is the state of each individual or with each individual person. The reason why the state of faith is meant is that 'the name of Jehovah' 
means everything in its entirety through which the Lord is worshipped, thus all aspects of faith and charity, <a href="2724.htm">2724</a>, <a href="3006.htm">3006</a>, <a href="6674.htm">6674</a>. Consequently 'putting the memory of the name of Jehovah God' means 
[that state in] the person with whom - that is, in whose heart - charity and faith that come from the Lord are present. The meaning in the literal sense is that they were to sacrifice burnt  offerings 
and eucharistic offerings, thus their flocks and herds, in Jerusalem, this being the place chosen by the Lord for them in which to worship Him, and so in which 'He put the memory of His name'. A place 
is not meant however in the internal sense, but each individual person with whom charity and faith are present; for 'place' does not mean place in the internal sense but state, and 'name' does not mean 
name but faith and worship, so that a person who has attained a state in which faith is being received from the Lord is meant. In Jerusalem furthermore, the place in which the Lord was worshipped 
through the burnt offerings and eucharistic offerings, all things of the Church were represented. This is why 'Jerusalem' in the Word, and 'the New Jerusalem' in the Book of Revelation, means the Lord's 
Church; and the Lord's Church exists with each individual person in a state in which charity and faith received from the Lord are present. For a person is in himself the Church, and the many with whom 
the Church exists compose the Church collectively. From all this it is also evident that 'in every place in which I shall put the memory of My name' means the state of faith with each individual person. </p>

`In omni loco {1} quo memoriam posuero nominis Mei': quod significet statum fidei [in Dominum] apud unumquemvis, constat ex significatione `loci' quod sit status, de qua n. 2625, 2837, 3356, 3387, 3404, 
4321, 4882, (x)5605, 7381, ita omnis locus est status (x)unius cujusvis seu apud unumquemvis; quod sit status fidei, est quia `nomen Jehovae' significat omne in uno complexu per quod colitur Dominus, 
ita omnia fidei et charitatis, n. 2724, 3006, 6674; proinde `memoriam ponere nominis Jehovae Dei' est apud quem seu in cujus corde charitas et fides est a Domino. Secundum sensum litterae est quod 
sacrificaturi essent {2} holocausta et eucharistica, ita greges (o)suos et armenta sua in Hierosolyma, quae erat locus quem elegit Dominus ad cultum Sui, ita in quo posuit memoriam nominis Sui; sed secundum 
sensum internum non intelligitur locus, sed unusquisque homo apud quem fides et charitas, {3} nam per `locum' non significatur locus in sensu interno sed status, nec per `nomen' nomen sed fides 
et cultus, ita intelligitur homo qui in statu receptionis fidei est a Domino; praeterea in Hierosolyma, quae erat locus in quo Dominus per (x)holocausta et eucharistica colebatur, repraesentabantur 
omnia quae Ecclesiae; inde per Hierosolymam in Verbo, et {4} per Novam Hierosolymam in Apocalypsi, significatur Ecclesia Domini; et Ecclesia Domini est apud unumquemvis qui in statu receptionis charitatis 
et fidei est a Domino, ipse enim homo est Ecclesia, et plures (o)apud quos Ecclesia, faciunt Ecclesiam in communi; inde quoque patet quod per `in omni loco quo posuero memoriam nominis Mei' significetur 
status fidei apud unumquemvis. @1 i in IT$ @2 sacrificarent$ @3 etiam$ @4 i hoc est, apud quem memoria nominis Dei [or Domini],$ </p>
