<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3100节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3100.</strong>“那人对她惊叹不已，默不作声”表对这些事的直觉状态。这从“惊叹不已，默不作声”含义清楚可知。“惊叹不已，默不作声”是指（当他发现自己心里所说的事正在发生时）有点承认，同时又想看看事情是否真的如此。他“惊叹不已”是因为他承认事情在照着他所祈求的发生；他“默不作声”是因为他想看看事情是否真的如此。这就是所表示的直觉状态。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3100</b></p><p><b>3100.</b>
The man marveling at her, withheld himself. That this signifies a state of perception as to those things, is evident from the signification of "marveling," and of "withholding himself" (when he saw that 
those things which he spoke in his heart had come to pass), as being somewhat of acknowledgment, and at the same time of waiting to see whether it was not so; for he marveled because he acknowledged 
that it had so come to pass, and he withheld himself because he waited to see whether it was not so; this is the state of perception which is signified. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3100</b></p><p><b>3100.</b>
'The man, wondering at her, remained silent' means a state of perception regarding those things. This is clear from the meaning of 'wondering but remaining silent' - when he saw that the things he had 
spoken in his heart were actually taking place - as a state of acknowledgement, yet at the same time of waiting to see whether it really was so. He 'wondered' because he acknowledged that things were 
happening as he had prayed, but he 'remained silent' because he was waiting to see whether it was in fact so. This is the state of perception that is meant. </p>

</p><b>3100.</b>
`Vir obstupescens illi continens se': quod significet statum perceptionis quoad illa, constat a significatione `obstupescere et se continere,' quando vidit quod illa quae locutus {1}est corde suo, evenirent, 
quod sit agnitionis et simul exspectationis annon ita; `obstupescebat' enim quia agnovit quod ita fieret, et `se continebat' quia exspectabat annon ita [esset;] ille status perceptionis est 
qui significatur. @1 in$ </p>
