<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>879.</strong>创世记8:10-11 他又等了七天，再继续把鸽子从方舟放出去。到了晚上，鸽子回到他那里，看哪，嘴里衔着一片啄下来的橄榄叶。挪亚就知道水从地上退了。<br />“他又等了七天”表重生的第二状态的开始，“七天”表神圣之物，因为现在论述的是仁爱。“再继续把鸽子从方舟放出去”表接受信之良善与真理的状态。“到了晚上，鸽子回到他那里”表它们开始一点一点地显现，“到了晚上”类似于黎明前的曙色朦胧。“看哪，嘴里衔着一片啄下来的橄榄叶”表些许信之真理：“叶”表真理；“橄榄”表源于仁爱的良善；“啄下来”表信之真理源于仁爱的事实；“嘴里”表它显为可见的事实。“挪亚就知道水从地上退了”表这些事物就是这样，因为现在造成阻碍的虚假比以前少了。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]879.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_879/bible_king-james-version_genesis_8_10-11" target=_top>Genesis 8:10-11</a>. And he waited yet another seven days and proceeded to send the dove out from the ark. And the dove returned to him at evening time, and look: the torn-off leaf of an olive tree in its mouth! And Noah realized that the water had lessened off the earth.<br />He waited another seven days symbolizes the start of the second stage of regeneration. Seven days symbolizes holiness, since the current subject is charity. And he proceeded to send the dove out from the ark symbolizes the right conditions for taking in the goodness and truth of faith. And the dove returned to him at evening time means that goodness and truth began to show just a little bit. Evening time resembles conditions during the half-light that precedes morning. And look: the torn-off leaf of an olive tree in its mouth, symbolizes a very small quantity of religious truth. The leaf means truth, an olive tree means the good that charity inspires, torn off means that this is the source of religious truth, and in its mouth means that it became visible. And Noah realized that the water had lessened off the earth means that these things were now possible because falsity was not so overpowering that it got in the way, as it had previously. </p>

Verses 10, 11. And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; and the dove came back to him at eventide; and lo in her mouth an olive leaf plucked off; so Noah knew 
that the waters were abated from off the earth. "And he stayed yet other seven days" signifies the beginning of the second state of regeneration; "seven days" signify what is holy, because now charity 
is treated of; "and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark" signifies a state of receiving the goods and truths of faith; "and the dove came back to him at eventide" signifies that little by 
little they began to appear; "eventide" means as in the twilight before morning; "and lo in her mouth an olive leaf plucked off" signifies some little of the truth of faith; "a leaf" is truth; "olive" 
the good of charity; "plucked off" means that the truth of faith is therefrom; "in her mouth" means that it was shown; "so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth" signifies that these 
things were so because the falsities that impeded were less abundant than before. </p>

Verses 10, 11 And he waited yet another seven days, and then proceeded to send out the dove from the ark. And the dove came back to him at evening time; and behold, in its mouth an olive leaf plucked 
off. And Noah knew that the waters had abated from over the earth. </p>
<p>'He waited yet another seven days' means the beginning of the second state of regeneration, 'seven days' meaning that which is holy, 
because now charity is the subject. 'And he proceeded to send out the dove from the ark' means a state of receiving the goods and truths of faith. 'And the dove returned to him at evening time' means 
that these started to show themselves a little, 'evening time' being similar in meaning to pre-morning twilight. 'And behold, in its mouth an olive leaf plucked off means a small measure of the truth 
of faith, 'leaf' meaning truth,' olive good that stems from charity, 'plucked off' the fact that the truth of faith derives from that charity, and 'in its mouth' the fact that it was made visible. 
'And Noah knew that the waters had abated from over the earth' means that all this was so because the obstructive falsities were now fewer than previously. </p>

Vers. 10, 11.  Et exspectavit adhuc septem dies alios, et perrexit emittere columbam de arca.  Et reversa est ad illum columba ad tempus vesperae; et ecce folium olivae decerptum in ore illius; et cogitare 
Noah quod diminutae aquae de super terra. 'Quod exspectaverit adhuc septem dies' significat principium secundi status regenerationis; 'septem dies' significant sanctum, quia nunc de charitate: 
'et perrexit emittere columbam de arca' significat statum recipiendi bona et vera fidei: 'et reversa est ad illum columba ad tempus vesperae' significat quod pauxillum apparere inciperent; 'tempus vesperae' 
est sicut in diluculo ante mane: 'et ecce folium olivae decerptum in ore ejus' significant aliquantulum veri fidei; 'folium' est verum; 'oliva' est bonum charitatis; 'decerptum' est quod verum 
fidei inde; 'in ore ejus' est quod ostensum: 'et cognovit Noah quod diminutae aquae de super terra' significant quod haec ita, quia falsitates non tantae, ut prius, quae impedirent. </p>
