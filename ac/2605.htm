<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2605节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2605.</strong>我也曾与古教会的一些人交谈过。那时，他们知道那将要来的主，也吸取信仰的良善品质。但他们终究堕落了，沦为偶像崇拜者。他们在左前方一个黑暗地域，处境悲惨。他们的说话声听上去就象单调乏味的笛音，几无理性思想。他们说，他们已在那里呆了许多世纪了，有时被放出来为别人执行某些卑微的任务。这让我反思许多基督徒在来世所面临的命运，虽然表面上看，他们并不敬拜偶像，但内心里却是偶像崇拜者，因为他们从心里否认主，从而也否认信之真理。</p>

I have spoken with some who were in the Ancient Church, and who then knew concerning the Lord that He was to come, and who had been imbued with the goods of faith, but yet fell away and became idolaters. 
They were in front, toward the left, in a darksome place, and in a miserable state. Their speech was like the sound of a fife, of one tone, almost devoid of rationality of thought. They said that 
they had been there for many ages, and that they are sometimes taken out thence to serve others for some uses, which are vile. From these it was given me to think about many Christians, who are idolaters 
not exteriorly but interiorly, and who at heart deny the Lord, and thereby also the truths of faith; and to reflect upon what kind of a lot must await them in the other life. </p>

I have spoken to some who belonged to the Ancient Church and who at that time knew that the Lord was to come and who had been endowed with goods of faith but who nevertheless fell away and became idolaters. 
They were in a forward position towards the left, in a darkened place and in a wretched condition. Their speech sounded like a monotonous flute; it lacked almost any rationality of thought. They 
said they had been there for many ages and that they are sometimes brought out to perform certain tasks for others, which are menial. This led me to think about what fate in the next life awaits many 
Christians who are idolaters inwardly though not outwardly, and who at heart deny the Lord, and so also the truths of faith. </p>

</p><b>2605.</b>
Locutus sum cum quibusdam qui in Ecclesia Antiqua fuerunt, et qui tunc noverunt de Domino quod venturus, ac imbuti bonis fidei, sed usque desciverunt, et facti idololatrae; erant antrorsum versus sinistrum, 
in loco tenebricoso, et in statu miserabili; loquela eorum fuit sicut tibialis, unius toni, paene absque cogitationis rationali; dicebant quod ibi fuerint per multa saecula, et quod inde quandoque 
eximantur ut inserviant aliis pro aliquibus usibus qui viles sunt.  Ex illis cogitare datum de pluribus Christianis, qui non {1} exterius sed interius idololatrae sunt, ac corde negant Dominum, 
ita quoque vera fidei, qualis sors eos in altera vita maneat. 	@1 quidem.$ </p>
