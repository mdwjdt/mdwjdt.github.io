<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8946节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8946.</strong>“免得你的裸体在上头露出来”表关于这些事物的思维观念在这种情况下充满虚假，然后这种观念将显明出来。这从“裸体”和“露出来”的含义清楚可知：“裸体”是指缺乏真理（参看<a href="5433.htm">5433</a>节），因而是指一种充满虚假的思维观念；“露出来”是指显明出来。刚才（<a href="8945.htm">8945</a>节）已经解释这一切的含义，即：一个世人、灵人或天使若在天上被提升到更内在的层级，其品性，无论是他在真理方面的思维生命，还是他在良善方面的意愿生命，都会变得显而易见。因为天堂里的层级越内在，良善就越纯粹，真理也越纯粹。因此，为使属于思维的虚假和属于意愿邪恶不会出现，而是隐藏起来，人们被保持在较低的层级，在那里处于相对模糊的光中。由此也可以看出“没有人见耶和华而活”这句话是什么意思；因为耶和华是纯粹的爱，从祂发出纯粹的光；在这爱和光中被看见就是灭亡。因此，连天上的天使本身也被云彩遮盖、保护（<a href="6849.htm">6849</a>节）；所以地狱里的所有人都被浓雾或密云笼罩（<a href="3340.htm">3340</a>，<a href="8137.htm">8137</a>，<a href="8138.htm">8138</a>，<a href="8814.htm">8814</a>，<a href="8819.htm">8819</a>节），因为那里的浓雾或乌云是虚假。</p>

That thy nakedness be not uncovered upon it. That this signifies the idea of thought concerning them thus full of falsities, which idea will then be made manifest, is evident from the signification of 
"nakedness," as being that which is destitute of truths (see n. 5433), thus an idea of thought full of falsities; and from the signification of being "uncovered," as being to be made manifest. How the 
case herein is, has been explained just above (n. 8945), namely, that a man, a spirit, or an angel, when raised more interiorly into heaven, appears such as he is as to both his lives; as to the life 
of his thought with respect to truths, and as to the life of his will with respect to goods; for the more interior the advance into the heavens, the purer is the good, and the purer the truth. In order 
therefore that the falsities which are of the thought, and the evils which are of the will, should not appear, but be hidden, they are kept in lower parts, where they are in a comparatively obscure 
light. From all this also it can be seen what was meant by the saying that "no one can see Jehovah and live;" for Jehovah is pure love, and from Him is pure light, and to be seen in these is to perish. 
Therefore also the angels themselves in heaven are covered with a cloud (n. 6849); and all who are in hell are veiled in thick clouds (n. 3340, 8137, 8138, 8814, 8819); for clouds there are falsities. </p>

'In order that your nakedness may not be revealed on it' means the mental picture of those things, which in that event is full of falsities, will then be disclosed. This is clear from the meaning of 
'nakedness' as being made destitute of truths, dealt with in <a href="5433.htm">5433</a>, thus a mental picture full of falsities; and from the meaning of 'being revealed' as being disclosed. The implications of all this have 
been explained immediately above in <a href="8945.htm">8945</a>. Those implications are that the character of any man, spirit, or angel's life becomes apparent - both the life of his thought in regard to truths, and the 
life of his will in regard to forms of good - if he is raised to a more internal level in heaven. For the more internal the level in the heavens, the purer the good is and the purer the truth. In order 
therefore that falsities belonging to thought and evils belonging to the will may not be seen but remain hidden, people are held back on lower levels, where they are in dimmer light relatively. From 
all this also one may see what the words 'no one can see ]Jehovah and live' were used to mean. For Jehovah is pure love, and from Him radiates pure light; to be seen in these is to be destroyed. Therefore 
also the angels themselves in heaven are protected by a cloud, <a href="6849.htm">6849</a>; and therefore all in hell are veiled by thick mists, <a href="3340.htm">3340</a>, <a href="8137.htm">8137</a>, <a href="8138.htm">8138</a>, <a href="8814.htm">8814</a>, <a href="8819.htm">8819</a>, since mists are falsities. </p>

`Ut non reveletur nuditas tua super illo': quod significet ideam cogitationis de illis sic falsis plenam, quae tunc manifestabitur, constat ex significatione `nuditatis' quod sit destitutum veris, de 
qua n. 5433, ita idea cogitationis falsis plena, et ex significatione `revelari' quod sit manifestari. Quomodo cum hoc se habet, mox supra n. 8945 explicatum est, quod nempe homo, spiritus, seu angelus, 
appareat qualis est quoad utramque vitam, quoad vitam cogitationis de veris, et quoad vitam voluntatis de bonis, si interius in caelum elevatur; nam quo interius in caelis, eo purius bonum et purius 
verum; ne itaque appareant falsa quae cogitationis et mala quae voluntatis, sed abscondantur, ideo tenentur in inferioribus, ubi in obscuriore luce sunt respective. Ex his quoque constare potest quid 
intellectum fuit per quod `nemo possit videre Jehovam et vivere,' nam Jehovah est purus amor, et ab Ipso est pura lux, in illis videri est perire; idcirco etiam ipsi angeli in caelo nube teguntur, 
n. 6849, et idcirco omnes qui in inferno, obvelantur densis nimbis, n. 3340, 8137, 8138, 8814, 8819, nam nimbi sunt falsa.    De Spiritibus et Incolis Planetae Saturni </p>
