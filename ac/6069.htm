Verses 2-6. And from among his brethren he took five men, and set them before Pharaoh. And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What are your works? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are a shepherd 
of the flock, both we and our fathers. And they said unto Pharaoh, To sojourn in the land have we come; for there is no pasture for thy servants' flock; for the famine is grievous in the land of Canaan; 
and now I pray let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren have come unto thee; the land of Egypt before thee is it; in the best 
of the land make thy father and thy brethren dwell; let them dwell in the land of Goshen; and if thou knowest, and there be among them, men of activity, then set them as princes over my cattle. "And 
from among his brethren he took five men," signifies from the truths of the church some; "and set them before Pharaoh," signifies insinuation into memory-knowledges; "and Pharaoh said unto his brethren," 
signifies a perception about the truths of the church in the natural; "What are your works?" signifies about services and uses; "and they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are a shepherd of the flock," 
signifies that they lead to good; "both we and our fathers," signifies that this is so from the ancients; "and they said unto Pharaoh," signifies continuance of perception; "To sojourn in the land 
have we come," signifies to seek life in memory-knowledges; "for there is no pasture for thy servants' flock," signifies that memory-knowledges are wanting in which are goods of truth; "for the famine 
is grievous in the land of Canaan," signifies that there is a lack of such things in the church; "and now I pray let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen," signifies that they may live in the midst 
of them; "and Pharaoh said unto Joseph, saying," signifies perception in the natural where memory-knowledges are; "Thy father and thy brethren have come unto thee," signifies with respect to the influx 
of the internal celestial into spiritual good from the natural, and into the truths of the church there; "the land of Egypt before thee is it," signifies that the memory-knowledges of the natural 
mind are under the auspices of the internal celestial; "in the best of the land make thy father and thy brethren dwell," signifies that they should live in the inmost of these; "let them dwell in the 
land of Goshen," signifies where is the midst; "and if thou knowest, and there be among them, men of activity," signifies the more excellent things in doctrine; "then set them as princes over my cattle," 
signifies that they may be the primary things of memory-knowledges. </p>

Verses 2-6 And from his brothers' party he took five men, and placed them before Pharaoh. And Pharaoh said to his brothers, What are your works?<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> And they said to Pharaoh, Shepherds of the flock are 
your servants, both we and our fathers. And they said to Pharaoh, We have come to sojourn in the land, for there is no pasture for the flock which belongs to your servants, for the famine is serious in 
the land of Canaan; and now let your servants, we beg you, dwell in the land of Goshen. And Pharaoh said to Joseph - he said, Your father and your brothers have come to you. The land of Egypt is before 
you; in the best of the land cause your father and your brothers to dwell; let them dwell in the land of Goshen. And if you know that there are among them men with energy, then set them as the chief 
men over the livestock belonging to me. </p>
<p>'And from his brothers' party he took five men' means some of the truths of the Church. 'And placed them before Pharaoh' means an introduction into factual 
knowledge. 'And Pharaoh said to his brothers' means perception regarding the truths of the Church within the natural. 'What are your works?' means regarding duties and useful services. 'And they said 
to Pharaoh, Shepherds of the flock are your servants' means that they lead to good. 'Both we and our fathers' means that this was so since the time of the ancients. 'And they said to Pharaoh' means 
a continuation of the perception. 'We have come to sojourn in the land' means a seeking to live in factual knowledge. 'For there is no pasture for the flock which belongs to your servants' means that 
factual knowledge holding forms of the good of truth is wanting. 'For the famine is serious in the land of Canaan' means that there is a lack of such forms in the Church. 'And now let your servants, we 
beg you, dwell in the land of Goshen' means so that they may live in the middle of them. 'And Pharaoh said to Joseph - he said' means perception in the natural where factual knowledge resides. 'Your 
father and your brothers have come to you' means regarding the influx of the internal celestial into spiritual good from the natural and into the truths of the Church there. 'The land of Egypt is before 
you means that factual knowledge in the natural mind is subject to the guidance of the internal celestial. 'In the best of the land cause your father and your brothers to dwell' means that they may 
live in the inmost part of it. 'Let them dwell in the land of Goshen' means where the middle is. 'And if you know that there are among them men with energy' means the more outstanding contents of doctrine. 
'Then set them as the chief men over the livestock belonging to me' means that they are the first and foremost among known facts.

Vers. 2-6.  Et e parte fratrum suorum accepit quinque viros, et statuit illos coram Pharaone.  Et dixit Pharaoh ad fratres ejus, Quid opera vestra? et dixerunt ad Pharaonem, Pastor gregis servi tui, 
etiam nos, etiam patres nostri.  Et dixerunt ad Pharaonem, Ad peregrinandum in terra venimus, quia nullum pascuum gregi qui servis tuis, quia gravis fames in terra Canaan; et nunc habitent quaeso servi 
tui in terra Goshen.  Et dixit Pharaoh ad Josephum, dicendo, Pater tuus et fratres tui venerunt ad te.  Terra Aegypti coram te haec, in optimo terrae habitare fac patrem tuum et fratres tuos, habitent 
in terra Goshen; et si nosti, et sit in illis viri strenuitatis, et ponas illos principes pecoris super quod mihi.   `Et {1}a parte fratrum suorum accepit quinque viros' significat e veris Ecclesiae 
aliqua:  `et statuit illos coram Pharaone' significat insinuationem in scientifica:  `et dixit Pharaoh ad fratres ejus' significat perceptionem de veris Ecclesiae in naturali:  `Quid opera vestra' 
significat de officiis et usibus:  `et dixerunt ad Pharaonem, Pastor gregis servi tui' significat quod ducant ad bonum:  `etiam nos, etiam patres nostri' significat quod ita ab antiquis:  `et dixerunt 
ad Pharaonem' significat continuum perceptionis:  `Ad peregrinandum in terra venimus' significat quod ad quaerendam vitam in scientificis:  `quia nullum pascuum gregi qui servis tuis' significat quod 
scientifica desint in quibus veri bona:  `quia gravis fames in terra Canaan' significat quod defectus talium in Ecclesia:  et nunc habitent quaeso servi tui in terra Goshen' significat ut vivant in medio 
illorum:  `et dixit Pharaoh ad Josephum, dicendo' significat perceptionem in naturali ubi scientifica:  `Pater tuus et fratres tui venerunt ad te' significat de influxu caelestis interni in bonum 
spirituale e naturali, et in vera Ecclesiae ibi:  `terra Aegypti coram te haec' significat quod scientifica mentis naturalis sub auspicio caelestis interni:  `in optimo terrae habitare fac patrem tuum 
et fratres tuos' significat quod in intimo illorum vivant:  `habitent in terra Goshen' significat ubi medium:  `et si nosti, et sit in illis viri strenuitatis' significat praestantiora in doctrina: 
 `et ponas illos principes pecoris super quod mihi' significat quod sint primaria scientificorum. @1 thus I here and 6070; cp. above$ </p>
