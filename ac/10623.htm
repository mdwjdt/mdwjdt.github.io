<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10623节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10623</strong>.“必在儿子和儿孙身上察罚父亲的罪孽”表对邪恶和由它们产生的一系列虚假的弃绝和定罪。这从“察罚”、“父亲”和“儿子”的含义清楚可知：“察罚”、是指对邪恶的抛弃和定罪，如下文所述；“父亲”是指良善，在反面意义上是指邪恶（<a href="3703.htm">3703</a>，<a href="5902.htm">5902</a>，<a href="6050.htm">6050</a>，<a href="10490.htm">10490</a>节）；“儿子”是指真理，在反面意义上是指虚假（参看<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>，<a href="10490.htm">10490</a>节），因此，“儿孙”表示由邪恶所产生的一系列虚假。对邪恶和由它们所产生的虚假的抛弃和定罪是指对那些陷入这类邪恶和虚假之人的抛弃和定罪；因为邪恶和虚假只存在于它们的主体里面，也就是存在于人里面。要知道，“儿子”表示邪恶的虚假，是因为他们所来自的“父亲”表示邪恶。至于什么叫邪恶的虚假，什么叫不属邪恶的虚假，可参看10109节提到的地方。<br />不了解圣言内义的人很容易相信，耶和华会在儿子和儿孙身上察罚父亲的罪孽，所以儿子要为父亲的邪恶而受惩罚。但这并不是这些话的意思，这一点从神性律法很清楚地看出来，即：父不可因子而被处死，子也不可因父而被处死；凡处死的都是因自己的恶（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申24.16.htm">24:16</a>）。从这条律法明显可知，这些话不可照字义来理解。父亲，他们的儿子和儿孙表示那些陷入邪恶和由它们所产生的一系列虚假之人，这一点从内义清楚看出来；就内义而言，父亲和儿子表示邪恶和虚假。当某个世人阅读圣言时，也会看见圣言含义的天使对此处的“父亲”和“儿子”没有别的理解。因为在天上，就是天使生活的地方，没有像世人当中的那种关于什么是父亲、什么是儿子的知识；那里的人不承认任何人为自己的父亲，也不承认任何人为自己的儿子。那里没有如在世上那样的出生。因此，当在圣言中，经上提到父亲和儿子时，天使就会想到属灵的出生，也就是良善和真理，或邪恶和虚假的出生。因此，他们将父亲理解为良善或邪恶，将儿子理解为真理或虚假，因为良善是真理的父亲，邪恶是虚假的父亲。<br />“察罚”之所以表示抛弃和定罪，是因为察罚在邪恶到达自己的终结阶段或完结之后，实际的定罪之前到来；在圣言中，“最后的审判”就表示这种实际的定罪。因为察罚就是检查一个人，以查明他真正的品性。但这一切发生在来世，具体地发生在每一个从世界进入来世的人身上，总体地发生在教会结束时所有人身上，如刚才所述（<a href="10622.htm">10622</a>节）。关于察罚，可参看前面的阐述和说明（<a href="6588.htm">6588</a>，<a href="6895.htm">6895</a>，<a href="10509.htm">10509</a>节）。</p>

Visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons and upon the sons' sons. That this signifies the rejection and condemnation of evils and the derivative falsities in a long series, is evident from 
the signification of "visiting," as being the casting out and condemnation of evils (of which below); from the signification of "fathers," as being goods, and in the opposite sense, evils (n. 3703, 5902, 
6050, 10490); and from the signification of "sons," as being truths, and in the opposite sense, falsities (see n. 1147, 10490); consequently "sons' sons" denote falsities from evils in a long series. 
By the casting out and condemnation of evils and the derivative falsities is meant the casting out and condemnation of those who are in evils and the derivative falsities; for evils and falsities 
have no existence except in subjects, which are men. Be it known that falsities of evil are meant by "sons," because the "fathers" from whom they are, denote evils. (What falsities of evil are, and falsities 
not of evil, may be seen at the places cited in n. 10109.)  [2] He who is not acquainted with the internal sense of the Word might easily believe that Jehovah visits the iniquity of the fathers 
upon the sons and upon the sons' sons, consequently that the sons are to suffer punishment for the evils of their fathers; but that this is not the meaning is very evident from the Divine law that 
the fathers are not to die for their sons, nor the sons for their fathers, but every man for his own evil (Deut. 24:16). From this it is evident that these words are to be understood otherwise than according 
to the letter. That it is those who are in evils and from this in falsities in a long series who are signified by "fathers," and their "sons and sons' sons," is evident from the internal sense, 
in which "fathers" and "sons" signify evils and falsities. The angels, who also perceive the Word when it is being read by a man, here understand nothing else by "fathers" and by "sons"; because in 
heaven, where the angels are, it is not known, as it is with men, what a father is, and what a son is, for there no one acknowledges anyone for his father, nor anyone for his son, because no one is born 
there as in the world; and therefore when mention is made in the Word of "father" and "son," the angels perceive these expressions as relating to spiritual births, which are those of good and truth, 
or of evil and falsity; and therefore by "fathers" they perceive goods or evils, and by "sons" truths or falsities, because good is the father of truth, and evil is the father of falsity. [3] The reason 
why "visitation" signifies casting out and damnation, is that it follows the consummation of evils, and precedes the condemnation itself which is meant in the Word by the "Last Judgment." For visitation 
is the searching out of a man in respect to his character. But this is effected in the other life; in particular, with everyone who comes there from the world; and in general, with all at the 
end of the church (as was said just above, n. 10622). (Concerning visitation, see what has been said and shown at n. 6588, 6895, 10509.) </p>

'Visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the sons and on the sons of sons' means the rejection and condemnation of evils and of a long line of falsities arising from them. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'visiting' as the casting out and condemnation of evils, dealt with below; from the meaning of 'the fathers' as forms of good, and in the contrary sense evils, dealt with in <a href="3703.htm">3703</a>, <a href="5902.htm">5902</a>, <a href="6050.htm">6050</a>, <a href="10490.htm">10490</a>; 
and from the meaning of 'the sons' as truths, and in the contrary sense falsities, dealt with in <a href="1147.htm">1147</a>, <a href="10490.htm">10490</a>, so that 'the sons of sons' means a long line of falsities arising from evils. By the 
casting out and condemnation of evils and of the falsities arising from them the casting out and condemnation of those ruled by such evils and falsities should be understood; for evils and falsities 
have no existence other than within their subjects<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>, that is, within people. It should be recognized that the falsities of evil are meant by 'the sons' because the fathers from whom they spring mean evils. 
What falsities of evil and falsities not of evil are, see in the places referred to in <a href="10109.htm">10109</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 A person unacquainted with the internal sense of the Word may easily be led to believe that 
Jehovah visits the iniquity of the fathers on the sons and on the sons of sons, consequently that the sons are going to pay the penalty for their fathers' evils. But this is not the meaning of those words, 
as is plainly evident from the Divine law that fathers shall not die because of sons, nor sons because of fathers, but each because of his own evil, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2024:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 24:16</a>. From this law it is evident that 
those words are to be understood differently from their literal meaning. The fact that those who are ruled by evils and the long line of falsities arising from them are meant by the fathers, their sons, 
and their sons' sons, is clear from the internal sense, in which evils and falsities are meant by fathers and sons. Angels - who also see a meaning in the Word when someone in the world reads it - 
do not understand anything other than this here by fathers and sons. For in heaven, where angels live, there is no knowledge, as there is among people on earth, of what a father is or of what a son is; 
for nobody there acknowledges anyone to be his father or anyone to be his son. There are no births there as there are in the world. When therefore father and son are mentioned in the Word angels think 
of spiritual births, which are those of goodness and truth or else of evil and falsity. Consequently they understand forms of good or else evils by fathers, and truths or else falsities by sons, since 
good is the father of truth and evil is the father of falsity.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The reason why 'being visited' means being cast out and condemned is that this is what follows after evils reach their closing 
stage and comes before actual condemnation, meant in the Word by the last judgement. For visitation is the examination of a person to discover his true character. But this takes place in the next life, 
in particular when the individual person goes there from the world, and in general with all at the end of the Church, as stated immediately above in <a href="10622.htm">10622</a>. Regarding visitation, see what has been 
stated and shown in <a href="6588.htm">6588</a>, <a href="6895.htm">6895</a>, <a href="10509.htm">10509</a>.

`Visitans iniquitatem patrum super filios et super filios filiorum':  quod significet rejectionem et damnationem malorum et inde falsorum in longa serie, constat ex significatione `visitare' quod sit 
ejectio et damnatio malorum, de qua sequitur, ex significatione `patrum' quod sint bona, (c)et in opposito sensu mala, de qua n. 3703, 5902, 6050, 10490, et ex significatione `filiorum' quod sint vera, 
et in opposito sensu falsa, de qua n. 1147, 10490; inde `filii filiorum' sunt falsa ex malis in longa serie; per ejectionem et damnationem malorum et inde falsorum intelligitur ejectio et damnatio 
illorum qui in malis et inde falsis sunt, {1}nam mala et falsa non dantur nisi in subjectis, quae sunt homines.  Sciendum est quod falsa mali intelligantur per filios, quia patres (c)ex quibus, sunt 
mala.  Quid falsa mali, et falsa non mali, videatur in locis citatis n. 10109. 	[2] Qui non sensum internum Verbi novit, credere facile poterit quod Jehovah visitet iniquitatem patrum super filios et 
super filios filiorum, consequenter quod filii luituri sint mala patrum suorum; sed quod ille sensus non sit, constat manifeste ex lege Divina, quod 	Patres non morituri sint propter filios, nec filii 
propter patres, sed quisque propter suum malum, Deut. xxiv 16; </p>
<p>inde patet quod aliter intelligenda sint illa verba quam secundum litteram; quod sint illi qui in malis sunt et inde in falsis longa 
serie, qui per patres et eorum filios (c)et filios filiorum significentur, constat ex sensu interno, in quo `patres et filii' mala et falsa significant; ab angelis, a quibus Verbum ab homine lectum etiam 
percipitur, {2}non aliud per patres et per filios hic intelligitur, nam in caelo, ubi angeli, non scitur quid pater et quid filius, sicut {3}apud homines, nam nemo ibi agnoscit aliquem pro suo patre 
nec aliquem pro suo filio, non enim ibi nascuntur sicut in mundo; {4}quapropter cum pater et filius in Verbo nominantur, percipiunt angeli illos secundum nativitates spirituales, quae sunt boni et 
veri, seu mali et falsi, et ideo per patres bona vel mala, et per filios vera vel falsa, quoniam bonum est pater veri, ac malum est pater falsi. 	[3] Quod visitatio significet ejectionem et damnationem, 
est quia illa sequitur consummationem malorum, ac praecedit (x)ipsam damnationem, quae in Verbo intelligitur per ultimum judicium, visitatio enim est exploratio qualis homo est; sed id fit in altera 
vita, in particulari cum unoquovis qui e mundo illuc venit, et in communi cum omnibus ad finem Ecclesiae, ut mox supra n. 10622 dictum est.  De visitatione videantur quae n. 6588, 6895, 10509,  dicta
