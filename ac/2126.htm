<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2126节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2126.</strong>进一步的代表物则展示了当今那些教会中人如何攻击纯真本身。一个美丽、纯真的小孩子出现在那里，就在他眼前，使得恶魔和恶灵退离可憎行为的外在约束稍稍放松。然后，他们开始以各自不同的方式对待那个小孩子，踩踏他，想要杀了他，令人发指。因为在来世，小孩子代表纯真。然而，我惊叫说，活在肉身时并未发现他们有此类行为。但我得到的答复是，这就是他们的内在，若世间法律，以及诸如害怕丧失财产、地位、名声及其性命的外在约束不阻止他们，他们就会以这样的方式疯狂攻击所有纯真之人。他们听到这个答复后，竟然还取笑了一番。由此可见当今之人是何本性，以及末世即将来临的事实。</p>

It was further represented how opposed are those now within the church to innocence itself. There appeared a beautiful and innocent little child, at the sight of whom the external bonds by which evil 
genii and spirits are withheld from abominable deeds were slightly relaxed; and they then began to treat the little child in the most shocking manner-to trample on him, and to will the killing of him, 
one in one way, and another in another; for in the other life innocence is represented by infants. I remarked that during their bodily life such things do not appear in connection with these men, but 
it was answered that such are their interiors, and that if the civil laws did not hinder, and also other external bonds, such as the fear of the loss of property, of honor, of reputation, and of their 
life, they would rush insanely in the same way against all who are innocent. When they heard this answer, they made sport of it also. From what has been said we may see what is the quality of the men 
of the present day, and also that the last times are at hand. </p>

A further representation was made of how at the present time those inside the Church are opposed to Innocence itself. There appeared a beautiful and innocent child. Once it had appeared the external 
restraints by means of which evil genii and spirits are withheld from wickedness were relaxed a little. At that point they started to treat the little child very badly, to trample on it, and to wish to 
kill it, one in this way, another in that; for in the next life innocence is represented by means of little children. I exclaimed however that they are not seen to behave in such ways during the life 
of the body, to which the reply came that they are such interiorly and that but for civil laws to prevent them, and also other external restraints, such as the fear of losing wealth, position, and reputation, 
and the fear of losing their life, they would in the selfsame way rush madly against all who are innocent. When they heard this reply they poked fun at that too. What has been said therefore 
makes clear the character of people at the present day, as well as the fact that the last times are imminent. </p>

Porro etiam repraesentatum quomodo hodie illi qui intra Ecclesiam sunt, contra ipsam Innocentiam sunt {1}: visus est infans pulcher et innocens; quo viso vincula externa quibus tenentur mali genii et 
spiritus a flagitiosis, paulum remittebantur; tunc inceperunt infantem pessime tractare, illum conculcare, et velle occidere, unus sic et alter sic; innocentia enim in altera vita repraesentatur per 
infantes; at dixi, quod similia non appareant apud eos in vita corporis eorum; sed responsum, quod interiora eorum talia sint, et nisi leges civiles impedirent, tum alia vincula externa quae sunt timor 
jacturae lucri, honoris, famae, ac timor vitae, quod ita ruerent insane contra omnes innocentes: ii cum hoc responsum audiebant, etiam illud subsannabant.  Quales itaque hodie sunt, ex illis quae dicta, 
constare potest; tum quod ultima tempora instent. 	@1 sint.$ </p>
