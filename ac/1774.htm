<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1774节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1774.</strong>有些灵人不愿听闻有关圣言内在事物的任何内容，事实上，哪怕有能力理解，他们也不愿听闻。他们主要是那些将功德置于善行的人。因此，他们行善是出于我欲和物欲，或为了自己的名利，因而为了名声，而不是为了主的国。在来世，他们比谁都渴望进入天堂，然而，他们却在天堂之外。因为他们不愿具备对真理的认知，从而被良善感染。他们根据自己的谬念照字面意思解读圣言，并发展凡支持其恶欲的表述。这种人表现为一个老女人，她的脸很难看，但依然雪白，却不规则，这使得她很丑陋。而那些悦纳并喜爱圣言内在事物之人则表现为一个豆蔻少女，或花季少女，衣着华丽，饰有花环和天上的饰物。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1774.</strong> There are spirits who are reluctant to hear about the Word's deeper layers. In fact they refuse to understand the subject, although they are capable of doing so. Mainly they are people who had believed that good works deserve credit and had therefore done good out of love for themselves and worldly reward. In other words, their goal had been to gain high position or wealth and the reputation that goes with it, not to benefit the Lord's kingdom. In the next world they are more insistent than any others on getting into heaven, but they stay outside, because they do not want to learn the truth and therefore be affected by goodness. They interpret the letter of the Word to suit their delusions, bringing forward any passage that smiles favorably on their selfish urges.<br />They were represented by a little old lady whose face was ugly and yet snowy white, her appearance marred by distorted features.<br />Those who welcome and love the deeper layers of the Word, on the other hand, were represented by a girl just grown up, in the bloom of early womanhood, dressed in beautiful clothes, wearing wreaths and other splendid finery. </p>

There are spirits who do not desire to hear anything about the interior things of the Word; and even should they understand them, they are still unwilling. They are chiefly those who have placed merit 
in works, and who therefore have done goods from the love of self and of the world, or for the sake of the rank or wealth to be gained for themselves, and the consequent reputation, thus not for the 
sake of the Lord's kingdom. In the other life such desire more than others to enter heaven; but they remain outside of it; for they are unwilling to be imbued with the knowledges of truth, and thereby 
to be affected with good. They interpret the meaning of the Word from the letter according to their fancies, and by advancing whatever favors their cupidities with its approval. Such were represented 
by an old woman who had a face not comely, but of even snowy paleness, with irregular features [cui inerant inordinata], which made her ugly. But those who admit and love the interior things of the 
Word, were represented by a girl in early maidenhood, or in the flower of youth, handsomely dressed, and adorned with garlands and heavenly ornaments. </p>

There are spirits who are unwilling to listen to anything regarding the inner content of the Word. Indeed, no matter how much they are able to understand they are still unwilling. They are in particular 
those who have placed merit in good works, and who have therefore done good deeds for selfish and worldly reasons, that is, for the sake of eminent positions or of wealth which they may gain for themselves, 
and for the consequent reputation, and so not for the sake of the Lord's kingdom. In the next life such persons wish more than all others to enter heaven, yet they remain outside of it, for 
they are unwilling to be furnished with cognitions of truth and so to be stirred by an affection for good. They interpret the Word literally according to their own false notions, and advance whatever 
expresses approval of their evil desires. Such were represented by an aging woman whose face was unsightly but still with a snowy pallor, but with irregular features that made her ugly. On the other 
hand people who welcome and love the inner content of the Word were represented by a girl in the first stage of maidenhood, or first flush of youth, dressed beautifully and wearing garlands and heavenly 
adornments. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1774</b>
</p><b>1774.</b>
Sunt spiritus qui de interioribus Verbi nihil audire volunt, immo quamvis possunt intelligere, usque nolunt; sunt ii imprimis qui in operibus posuerunt meritum, et qui ideo quia bona ex amore sui et 
mundi, seu propter dignitatem aut opulentiam sibi acquirendam, et famam inde, fecerunt, ita non propter regnum Domini; tales in altera vita volunt prae ceteris intrat in caelum, sed extra caelum manent, 
nam nolunt imbui cognitionibus veri et ita affici bono, sensum Verbi ex littera secundum suas phantasias interpretando, et quicquid assensu favet cupiditatibus, producendo: tales repraesentabantur 
per vetulam faciei indecorae sed usque pallide niveae, cui inerant inordinata, a quibus deformis: at vero, qui interiora Verbi admittunt et amant, repraesentabantur per puellam in sua prima virginea 
aetate, se flore juventutis decore vestitam, cum corollis et caelestibus decoramentis. </p>
