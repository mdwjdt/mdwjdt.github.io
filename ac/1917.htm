<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1917节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1917.</strong>“愿耶和华在你我中间判断”表主的义愤。这从刚才所述清楚可知，因而是显而易见的，无需解释。除了那些经历过试探的争战之人外，没人能充分理解这些事。试探会带来荒废和荒凉的状态，以及绝望和随之而来的悲伤、愤怒的状态，此外还有其它内在痛苦情绪。这些事会照着恶与假的状态而各异，并交替发生。而这些恶与假是由魔鬼和恶灵激发的，争战就是针对它们发起的。魔鬼灵只喜欢寻找某种虚假，事实上，他们通常将自己身上的虚假引入人里面，同时又指控拥有它的这个人。这就是为何主的义愤如此之大，因为祂的第一理性中没有任何虚假，只有本身并非真理的真理表象，如前所述（<a href="1661.htm">1661</a>节，<a href="1911.htm">1911</a>节末尾）。</p>

Jehovah judge between me and thee. That this signifies the Lord's indignation, is evident from what has just been said, and thus without explication. No further idea of these things can be had, except 
by those who have been in the combats of temptations. In temptations there are vastations and desolations, and there are states of despair, and of consequent grief and indignation, besides other interior 
painful emotions; and this with variety and alternation, according to the states of evil and falsity which are excited by evil genii and spirits, and against which the combat is being waged. The 
diabolical spirits desire nothing more than to find some falsity, in fact it is common with them to induce a falsity from themselves, and then at the same time to make it the subject of accusation. Hence 
the Lord's indignation was so great, in whose first rational there was no falsity, but an appearance of truth that in itself was not true (spoken of before, n. 1661, 1911 at the end). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1917</b></p><p><b>1917.</b>
'May Jehovah judge between me and you!' means the Lord's righteous anger. This is clear from what has just been stated, and so is clear without explanation. Nobody can gain a fuller grasp of these matters 
except people who have experienced conflicts brought about by temptations. Temptations bring states of vastation and desolation, states of despair, and consequently of grief and anger, in addition 
to other inward painful emotions. These things occur varyingly and alternatingly according to the states of evil and falsity which evil genii and spirits arouse and against which conflict takes place. 
Devilish spirits like nothing better than to discover some falsity; indeed it is quite common for them to introduce a falsity from themselves into a person, and then at the same time to charge him 
with possessing it. This was why the Lord's anger was so great, for within His first rational there was no falsity, but there was the appearance of truth which in itself was not true, as dealt with already 
in <a href="1661.htm">1661</a> and <a href="1911.htm">1911</a> (end). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1917</b>
</p><b>1917.</b>
`Judicet Jehovah inter me et inter te': quod significet indignationem Domini, constat ab illis quae mox dicta sunt, ita absque explicatione. Quomodo haec porro se habent, idea non capi potest nisi ab 
illis qui in tentationum pugnis fuerunt; in tentationibus sunt vastationes et desolationes, sunt desperationes, ac inde indolentiae et indignationes, praeter alios motus dolorificos interiores, et hoc 
varie et alternis secundum status mali et falsi qui a malis geniis et spiritibus excitantur et contra quos pugnatur; diabolici spiritus nihil plus cupiunt quam invenire aliquod falsum, immo commune 
apud eos est inducere a se falsum, et simul tunc accusare; inde tanta Domini indignatio, in cujus primo rationali nullum falsum, sed apparentia veri quae in se non vera, de quibus prius n. 1661, 1911 ad fin. </p>
