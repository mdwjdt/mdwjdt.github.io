<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2603节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2603.</strong>有一些外邦人来自黑人地区，在世时认为若不经历惩罚和苦楚，没人能上天堂，他们因这种生活而渴望被严厉对待，觉得只有这样才能得到他们称之为天堂般的好东西。由于他们的观念源于其宗教信仰，所以在来世，他们一开始被某些他们称之为魔鬼的人苦待，之后被带到前面（<a href="1622.htm">1622</a>节）所描述的天堂乐园。不过，天使教导他们说，那些惩罚和苦楚被主转化为对那些外邦人有益的东西，就象主为经历试探之人所做的那样。他们还被告知，天堂乐园并非天堂，而是对它们里面的属天和属灵之物的情感，并且他们已经踏上一条真理之路，然而这路上有无知所投下的阴影。他们和我谈了很长时间。在受到苦待的状态下，他们的言语带有一点咔嗒声，因而是一种不同于其他人的言语。不过，他们一旦受完这些苦楚，就会被带到乐园，那时，他们的言语不再是这样，而是几乎如天使一般。出于自己所信的宗教信仰，他们渴望拥有内在事物。他们说，当受到苦待时，他们是黑的，但后来他们就脱去这黑色，换成白色。因为他们知道，尽管他们的肤色是黑的，但他们的灵魂却是白的。</p>

There are some Gentiles from those regions where they are black, who bring with them from their life in the world a wish to be treated severely; believing that no one can come into heaven except through 
punishments and afflictions, and that they will afterwards receive more gladsome things, which they call paradisal. As they have such ideas from their religion they are at first treated severely in 
the other life by some whom they call devils, and are afterwards taken to the paradises already described (n. 1622). But they are instructed by the angels that their punishments and afflictions are 
turned by the Lord into what is good for them, as with those who are in temptations; also that paradisal things are not heaven, but that heaven is the affection of the celestial and spiritual things that 
are in them; and that they have been in a certain way of truth, although in the shade of ignorance. They spoke with me a long time. While in their state of affliction their speech was attended with 
a kind of collision; thus was distinct from that of others; but after their afflictions were over, and they were taken up to the paradises, they no longer had such a speech, but one that was almost 
angelic. From their religion they have that they believe, and desire to have interior things. They said that whenever they are treated severely they are black; but that they shortly put off the blackness, 
and put on whiteness; knowing that their souls are white, but their bodies black. </p>

There are some gentiles from those regions where the people are black who bring with them from life in the world the desire to be treated harshly, for they believe that nobody can enter heaven except 
through punishment and affliction, and that only after that will they receive more gladsome things which they call paradise-like. Since they have with them such ideas derived from their religion, they 
are in the next life treated harshly at first by some whom they call devils, and are after that taken to the paradise gardens described in <a href="1622.htm">1622</a>. But they are taught by the angels that those punishments 
and afflictions are converted by the Lord into that which for those gentiles is good, as He does for those undergoing temptations. They are also told that the paradise gardens are not heaven but the 
affection for celestial and spiritual things that are within them, and that they have been in a certain way of truth, yet in the shadow cast by ignorance. They talked to me for a long time. While they 
were going through the state of afflictions their speech involved a sort of click,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and so was a different kind of speech from that used by others. But once the afflictions were over and they had 
been brought to those paradise gardens, their speech was no longer such but almost angelic. Also derived from their religion, in which they believe, they have the wish to possess interior things. They 
said that when they are being treated harshly they are black but that afterwards they cast away their blackness and take on a whiteness, for they know that their souls are white even though their bodies 
are black.

Sunt quidam gentiles ex illis regionibus ubi nigri sunt, qui secum e vita in {1} mundo trahunt, quod velint duriter tractari, credentes quod nemo in caelum possit venire quam per punitiones et afflictiones; 
et quod dein laetiora, quae paradisiaca vocant, accipiant: illi quia talia ex religioso secum habent, in altera vita etiam primum duriter tractantur a quibusdam, quos vocant diabolos, ac postea 
feruntur in paradisiaca, de quibus n. 1622; sed instruuntur ab angelis quod punitiones et afflictiones in bonum illis a Domino versae sint, sicut apud eos qui in tentationibus sunt; tum quod paradisiaca 
non sint caelum, sed affectio caelestium et spiritualium quae in illis; et quod in quadam via veritatis fuerint, sed in umbra ignorantiae.  Diu mecum locuti sunt; quando in statu afflictionum erant, 
loquela eorum tunc erat quasi cum quodam collisu, ita distincta ab aliorum; sed illis peractis, cum ad paradisiaca sublati, non illis talis loquela amplius, sed paene angelica.  Ex religioso etiam 
suo habent quod credunt, quod interiora habere velint; dicebant, cum duriter tractantur quod tunc nigri sint, at {2} quod postmodum exuant nigredinem, ac induant candorem, scientes quod animae eorum 
candidae sint sed corpora nigra. 	@1 e I.$ 	@2 ac.$ </p>
