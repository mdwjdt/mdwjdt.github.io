<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3633节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3633.</strong>所有灵人与天使在自己看来都像男人和女人，具有和男人、女人一样的面孔和身体，以及器官和四肢。其原因在于，他们的至内层努力产生这样的形态，就像人源于父辈灵魂的原始细胞在卵子和子宫内努力形成完整的人，尽管这原始细胞并不具有身体形态，而是具有唯独主知道的另一种最完美的形态，所以在灵界，所有人都看似男人和女人。而且，整个天堂是这样：每个人可以说都是所有人的焦点，因为他是经由天堂的形态从所有人而来的流注的焦点。因此，天堂的形像在每个人里面被复制，并使他成为天堂、因而一个人的形像；因为整体如何，整体的任一部分就如何；部分必像它们的整体，以便它们可以属于整体。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3633</b></p><p><b>3633.</b>
All spirits and angels appear to themselves as men; of such a face and such a body, with organs and members; and this for the reason that their inmost conspires to such a form; just as the primitive 
of man, which is from the soul of the parent, endeavors toward the formation of the whole man in the ovum and the womb, although this primitive is not in the form of the body, but in another most perfect 
form known to the Lord alone; and inasmuch as the inmost with everyone in like manner conspires and endeavors toward such a form, therefore all there appear as men. Moreover the universal heaven is 
such that everyone is as it were the center of all, for he is the center of influxes from all through the heavenly form; and hence an image of heaven results in everyone, and makes him like unto itself, 
thus a man; for such as the general is, such is a part of the general, inasmuch as the parts must be like their general, in order that they may be of it. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3633</b></p><p><b>3633.</b>
To themselves all spirits and angels look like men and women, having the same kind of faces and bodies as men and women do, together with organs and limbs. The reason for this is that their inmost being 
endeavours to produce that form, even as the primitive cell of the human being, which originates in the soul of the parent, strives in the ovum and womb to form the complete human being, though this 
first cell does not possess the form of a body but another most perfect form known only to the Lord. And because in a similar way the inmost being with every spirit or angel endeavours and strives 
to produce such a form, all in the spiritual world consequently look like men and women. What is more, the whole of heaven is such that every one is so to speak the focal point of all, for he is the focal 
point of influxes coming through the heavenly form from all. Consequently the image of heaven is reproduced in everyone, making him a likeness of heaven and so a human being; for the character of 
the general whole determines that of any part of the general whole, since the parts must be like their general whole if they are to belong to it. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 3633</b>
</p><b>3633.</b>
Omnes spiritus et angeli apparent sibi sicut homines, tali facie et tali corpore, cum organis et membris, et hoc ex causa quia intimum eorum conspirat ad talem formam: sicut primitivum hominis, quod 
est ex anima parentis, connititur ad formationem totius hominis, in ovo et utero, tametsi primitivum hoc non in forma corporis est, sed in alia perfectissima, soli Domino nota: et quia intimum similiter 
apud unumquemvis conspirat et connititur ad talem formam, ideo apparent omnes ibi sicut homines. Et praeterea universum caelum tale est {1}ut unusquisque sit quasi centrum omnium, nam est centrum influxuum 
per formam caelestem ab omnibus, inde imago caeli resultat in unumquemvis, et facit eum sui similem, ita hominem; quale enim commune est, talis est pars communis; nam similes suo communi erunt 
partes ut sint ejus. @1 quod$ </p>
