<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2371节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2371.</strong>“又说，这个寄居的人”表那些具有不同教义和生活的人。这从“寄居”的含义清楚可知，“寄居”是指接受教导和生活，因而是指教义和生活（参看<a href="1463.htm">1463</a>，<a href="2025.htm">2025</a>节）。教会的状态在此被描述为接近末世，这时信已经没有了，因为仁没有了；也就是说，仁之善因与生活完全脱节，故也从教义上被弃绝。<br />此处所描述的人不是那些为了自己的利益解释所有的事，从而歪曲仁之善的人；也不是那些为了成为最大的、拥有全世界的好处而使得仁之善成为功德的获得者之人。他们亦非那些将赏赐的分配权硬性归给自己，并且在这样做时通过各种诡计和迷惑的手段玷污仁之善的人。所论述的主题乃是那些一点也不想听到仁之善，或善行，只想听到与它们分离之信的人。他们愿意通过以下推理听到这一点，即人里面无非是恶，甚至源于他自己的善本身也是恶，因而里面没有丝毫救恩；并且没人能凭善配得天堂、得救，唯有凭他们借以承认主功德的信。这就是当教会开始咽下最后一口气时的末世所兴起的教义，人们热情教导并欣然接受它。<br />但是，若由此断定人能过邪恶的生活，同时拥有良善的信仰，这必是一个错误的结论。若声称由于人里面无非是恶，故他无法接受来自主的良善，这良善有天堂在其中，因为有主在其中，并且有幸福快乐在其中，因为有天堂在其中，这也是一个错误的结论。而若断定由于没人能凭善配得天堂，故从主接受天堂之善是不可能的，在这天堂之善中的自我功德会被视为可怕的邪恶，这又是大错特错。所有天使都具有这种善，所有重生之人也具有这种善，那些感受到良善本身，即善情中的快乐，甚至幸福之人同样具有这种善。关于这种善，即仁爱，主在马太福音中如此说： <br />你们听见有话说，当爱你的邻舍，恨你的仇敌。只是我告诉你们：要善待恨你们的人，为那迫害你们的祷告。这样，就可以作你们天父的儿子；你们若单爱那爱你们的人，有什么赏赐呢？你们若单请你弟兄的安，比人有什么长处呢？就是税吏不也是这样行吗？（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.43.htm">5:43</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.48.htm">48</a>）<br />路加福音中也有类似的话，再加上这一句：<br />要善待他们，并要借给人不指望偿还，你们的赏赐就必大了，你们也必作至高者的儿子。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路6.27.htm">6:27</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路6.36.htm">36</a>）<br />此处描述了来自主的良善，它没有任何接受回报的意图。鉴于此，凡被这善所主导的人都被称为“天父的儿子”和“至高者的儿子”。然而，这善因有主在其中，故也有赏赐，正如我们在路加福音所读到的：<br />你摆设午饭或晚饭，不要请你的朋友、弟兄、亲属和富足的邻舍，恐怕他们也回请你，你就得了报答。你摆设筵席，倒要请那贫穷的、残废的、瘸腿的、瞎眼的，你就有福了！因为他们没有什么可报答你。到义人复活的时候，你要得着报答。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路14.12.htm">14:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路14.14.htm">14</a>）<br />“午饭”、“晚饭”或“筵席”表仁之善，主与人一起居于其中（<a href="2341.htm">2341</a>节）。故此处描述并清楚表明，由于主在这善中，故报答也在这善本身中，因为经上说“到义人复活的时候，你要得着报答”。<br />凡由于主的命令而努力凭自己行善的人就是那些最终接受这善，后来因被教导而承认一切善来自主的信仰之人（<a href="1712.htm">1712</a>，<a href="1937.htm">1937</a>，<a href="1947.htm">1947</a>节）。这时，他们如此厌恶自我功德，以至于仅仅想到它就感到悲哀，并发觉他们所拥有的幸福快乐锐减。<br />那些不去行善，反而过着邪恶生活，同时教导并宣扬救恩居于与仁分离之信中的人则迥然不同。这些人甚至意识不到这种善是可能的。说来奇怪，在来世，正如我通过大量经历所得知的，这种人想基于他们回想起来曾做到的所有善行而配得天堂；因为这时，他们第一次意识到，与仁分离之信中没有任何救恩。他们就是主在马太福音中所指的那些人：<br />当那日，他们必对我说，主啊，主啊，我们不是奉你的名传道，奉你的名赶鬼，奉你的名行许多异能吗？我就明明地告诉他们说，我从来不认识你们，你们这些作恶的人，离开我去吧！（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.22.htm">7:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.23.htm">23</a>）<br />从这些人身上也能看出，他们根本不理会主自己针对爱与仁之善多次所教导的任何事，相反，这些事在他们看来如同浮云，或夜里看到的东西。如马太福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太3.8.htm">3:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太3.9.htm">9</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.7.htm">5:7</a>-<a

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2371</b></p><p><b>2371.</b>
And they said, Is one come to sojourn, and shall he judge indeed? That this signifies those who are in another doctrine and another life, is evident from the signification of "sojourning," which is to 
be instructed and to live, thus doctrine and life (see n. 1463, 2025). The state of the church is here described such as it is near the last times, when there is no longer any faith, because there is 
no charity, namely, that the good of charity, because it has altogether receded from the life, is also rejected from the doctrine. [2] The subject here treated of is not those who falsify the good 
of charity by explaining all things in their own favor, both for their own sake, that they may be the greatest, and for the sake of the good things of this world, that they may possess them all; and who 
arrogate to themselves the dispensation of rewards, and thereby defile the good of charity by various arts and delusive means; but the subject treated of is those who desire to hear nothing of the 
goods of charity, or of good works, but only of faith separate from them; and this from reasoning that there is nothing but evil in man, and that the good which is from him is also in itself evil, in 
which therefore there is thus nothing of salvation; and that no one can merit heaven by any good, nor be saved by it, but only by the faith with which they acknowledge the Lord's merit. This is the doctrine 
that flourishes in the last times, when the church is beginning to expire, and it is ardently taught and favorably received. [3] But it is false to infer from these considerations that a man can 
have an evil life and a good faith; or that because there is nothing but evil in man, he cannot receive good from the Lord that has heaven in it because it has Him in it, and that having heaven in 
it has also bliss and happiness in it. And it is certainly very false to infer that because no one can merit heaven by any good, therefore it is impossible to receive from the Lord heavenly good in which 
self-merit is regarded as monstrous wickedness. In such good are all the angels, in such are all the regenerate, and in such are they who perceive delight, and even bliss, in good itself, that is, 
in the affection of it. Concerning this good, that is, concerning this charity, the Lord speaks thus in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Ye have heard that it has been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine 
enemy; but I say unto you, Do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that injure you and persecute you, that ye may be sons of your Father who is in the heavens; for if ye love them that love 
you, what reward have ye? And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more [than others]? do not even the publicans so? (Matt. 5:43-48). In like manner in Luke, with this addition: </p>
<p>     Do good, 
and lend, hoping for nothing again; then shall your reward be great, and ye shall be sons of the Highest (Luke 6:27-36). [4] Here the good which is from the Lord is described, and that it is free from 
all purpose of receiving recompense; on which account they who are in it are called "sons of the Father who is in the heavens," and "sons of the Highest;" and because the Lord is in it, there is also 
a reward, as we read in Luke: </p>
<p>     When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbors; lest haply they call thee in turn, and a 
recompense be made thee. But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, [the lame,] and the blind; then shalt thou be blessed, for they have not wherewith to recompense thee; but thou shalt 
be recompensed in the resurrection of the just* (Luke 14:12-14). A "dinner," "supper," or "feast," denotes the good of charity, in which there is the Lord's dwelling-place with man (n. 2341) so that 
it is here described, and made clearly manifest, that the recompense is in the good itself, because in this is the Lord; for it is said, "thou shalt be recompensed in the resurrection of the just." [5] 
Those who strive to do good of themselves, because the Lord has so commanded, are they who at length receive this good; and who, being afterwards instructed, acknowledge with faith that all good is 
from the Lord (n. 1712, 1937, 1947); and they are then so averse to self-merit that when they merely think of it they grow sad, and perceive their blessedness and happiness to be proportionately diminished. [6] 
Quite different is it with those who do not do this, but lead a life of evil, teaching and professing that in faith alone there is salvation. People of this character are not aware that such 
a good is possible; and wonderful to say (as has been given me to know from much experience) in the other life these same people desire to merit heaven on account of whatever good deeds they recollect; 
because then for the first time are they aware that in faith separated from charity there is no salvation. These are the people of whom the Lord says in Matthew: </p>
<p>     They will say to Me in that 
day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied by Thy name, and by Thy name cast out demons, and in Thy name done many mighty works? But then will I confess unto them, I know you not; depart from Me, ye that 
work iniquity (Matt. 7:22-23). In the case of these same people it also becomes apparent that they have paid no attention whatever to the things which the Lord Himself so often taught concerning the 
good of love and of charity; but that these things have been to them like passing clouds, or like things seen in the night: for example such things as are found in Matthew 3:8-9; 5:7-48; 6:1-20; 7:16-20, 
24-27; 9:13; 12:33; 13:8, 23; 18:21-23 and to the end; 19:19; 22:34-39; 24:12-13; 25:34 to the end; Mark 4:18-20; 11:13-14, 20; 12:28-35; Luke 3:8-9; 6:27-39, 43 to the end; 7:47; 8:8, 14-15; 10:25-28; 
12:58-59; 13:6-10; John 3:19, 21; 5:42; 13:34-35; 14:14-15, 20-21, 23; 15:1-8, 9-19; 21:15-17. Such, then, and other such things as these, are what are signified by the men of Sodom (that is, 
those who are in evil, n. 2220, 2246, 2322) saying to Lot, "Is one come to sojourn, and shall he judge indeed?" that is, Shall they who are in another doctrine and another life teach us? * Mortuorum, 
but elsewhere justorum, as in n. 6393. [Rotch ed.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2371</b></p><p><b>2371.</b>
'And they said, Did not this one come to sojourn' means people with different teaching and a different life. This is clear from the meaning of 'sojourning' as receiving instruction and living, and so 
as doctrine and life, dealt with in <a href="1463.htm">1463</a>, <a href="2025.htm">2025</a>. Here the nature of the state of the Church around the last times is described, when faith is no more because charity is no more, that is to say, when the 
good of charity is rejected on doctrinal grounds as well, because it has severed all connection with life. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The people described here are not those who falsify the good of charity by explaining 
things to their own advantage. They are not those who, so that they may be very great and may possess all the world's goods, make the good of charity the earner of merit. Nor are they those who assume 
the right to dispense rewards, and in so doing defile the good of charity by various devices and misleading means. Instead the subject is those who do not wish to hear anything about the goods of 
charity, that is, about good works, only about faith separated from those works. And this they wish to hear from the argument that man has nothing but evil within him and that even the good which springs 
from himself is in itself evil, and so contains nothing of salvation; and from the argument that no one can merit heaven by means of any good, nor accordingly be saved by it, only by means of a faith 
whereby they acknowledge the Lord's merit. This is the teaching which flourishes in the last times when the Church starts to breathe its last, and which is enthusiastically taught and favourably accepted. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
But to maintain from all this that anyone can lead an evil life and at the same time possess a faith that is good is a false conclusion. It is also a false conclusion to say that because 
man has nothing but evil within him, good from the Lord - which has heaven within it because it has the Lord within it, and blessedness and happiness within it because heaven is within it - cannot 
exist there. Finally it is a false conclusion to say that because nobody can merit [heaven] by any good, heavenly good from the Lord in which [self-] merit is regarded as something monstrous has no existence. 
Such good exists with every angel, such good exists with every regenerate person, and such good exists with those who perceive delight, and indeed blessedness, in good itself, that is, in the 
affection for it. The Lord speaks of this good or charity in the following way in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbour and hate your enemy. [But] I say to you, Love 
your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who hurt and persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For if you love those 
who love you, what reward have you? And if you salute only your brothers, what more are you doing [than others]? Do not even the tax-collectors do the same? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%205:%2043-48&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 5: 43-48</a> 
</blockquote>
<p>Similar words occur in 
Luke, with this addition, </p>
<blockquote>
Do good and lend, hoping for nothing in return, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%206:-27-36&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 6:-27-36</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Here good which is derived from 
the Lord is described and the fact that it does not carry any thought of repayment. Consequently people who are governed by that good are called 'sons of the Father who is in heaven', and 'sons of the 
Most High'. Yet because that good has the Lord within it there is also a reward: in Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
When you give a dinner or a supper, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your kinsmen or rich neighbours, 
lest perhaps they invite you back in return, and you are repaid. But when you give a feast invite the poor, the maimed, the blind, and you will be blessed, for they have nothing with which 
to repay you. You will be repaid at the resurrection of the just.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2014:-12-14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 14:-12-14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Dinner', 'supper', or 'feast' means the good that flows from charity, in which the Lord dwells together with man, <a href="2341.htm">2341</a>. Here it is described therefore, and it is plainly evident, that recompense lies within good itself since this has the Lord within it, for it is said that 'you will be repaid at the resurrection 
of the just'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 People who strive to do good from themselves because the Lord has commanded it to be done are the ones who at length receive this good and who after receiving instruction then acknowledge 
in faith that all good comes from the Lord, <a href="1712.htm">1712</a>, <a href="1937.htm">1937</a>, <a href="1947.htm">1947</a>. And they are now so opposed to self-merit that they are saddened by the mere thought of merit and perceive that blessedness and 
happiness with them is that much diminished. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 It is quite different in the case of those who fail to do good and instead lead an evil life, while teaching and professing that salvation resides in 
faith separated from charity. These people are not even aware of the possibility of such good. And what is remarkable the same people in the next life, as I have been given to know from much experience, 
wish to merit heaven on the basis of all the good deeds they recall their having done, for they are now aware for the first time that no salvation lies in faith separated from charity. But these 
are the ones whom the Lord refers to in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
They will say to Me on that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy by Your name, and by Your name cast out demons, and in Your name do many mighty works? 
But then will I declare to them, I do not know you; depart from Me, you workers of iniquity. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%207:%2022,%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 7: 22, 23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
With these people it is also seen that they had paid no attention at all to any one

These then, and other 
things like them, are what were meant by the words 'the men of Sodom' - that is, those immersed in evil, <a href="2220.htm">2220</a>, <a href="2246.htm">2246</a>, <a href="2322.htm">2322</a> - 'saying to Lot, Did not this one come to sojourn, and will he surely judge?' 
that is, Will people with different teaching and a different life teach us?

`Et dixerunt, Num unus venit ad peregrinandum': quod significet qui alia doctrina et alia vita sunt, constat a significatione `peregrinari' quod sit instrui et vivere, ita doctrina et vita, de qua n. 
1463, 2025.  Hic, status Ecclesiae describitur qualis est circa ultima tempora quando nulla amplius fides quia nulla charitas, quod nempe bonum charitatis quia secessit prorsus e vita, etiam rejiciatur 
ex doctrina; [2] hic non de illis agitur qui bonum charitatis falsificant, in sui favorem explicando, (c)et propter se ut maximi sint, et propter mundi bona ut omnia possideant, [meritorium faciunt]; 
ac dispensationes mercedum sibi arrogant, et sic bonum charitatis variis artibus et illusoriis modis conspurcant: sed de illis qui nihil de bonis charitatis seu de bonis operibus, sed solum de fide 
ab illis separata, audire volunt, et hoc ex ratiocinatione quod non nisi quam malum sit in homine et quod bonum quod ab ipso etiam in se malum sit, in quo sic nihil salutis, et quod mereri caelum per 
aliquod bonum nemo possit, ita non per illud salvari, sed solum per fidem, qua agnoscant meritum Domini; haec doctrina est quae ultimis temporibus quando exspirare incipit Ecclesia, viget et ardenter 
docetur et faventer arripitur; [3] se concludere inde, quod aliquis vitam habere possit {1} malam, et fidei bonam, falsum est; tum quoque, quia non nisi malum {2} in homine, non dari queat bonum a Domino, 
in quo quia Dominus est, caelum est, et quia caelum, est beatum et felix: demum, quia nemo per aliquod bonum mereri queat {3}, quod non detur bonum caeleste a Domino' in quo spectatur meritum ut 
quoddam enorme; in tali bono sui omnes angeli, in tali omnes regenerati, et in tali qui jucundum, immo beatum in ipso bono seu in ejus affectione percipiunt; de hoc bono seu de hac charitate, ita Dominus 
apud Matthaeum. 	Audivistis quod dictum sit, Amabis proximum tuum, odio habebis inimicum tuum: Ego dico vobis, [Amate inimicos vestros, benedicite maledicentibus vobis], benefacite odio vos habentibus, 
et orate pro laedentibus et persequentibus vos, sitis filii Patris vestri, Qui in caelis:... nam si amaveritis amant vos, quod praemium habetis? et si salutatis fratres vestros tantum, quid abundantius 
facitis? nonne etiam publicani sic faciunt? v (x)43-48: </p>
<p>similiter apud Lucam cum his adjectis, 	Benefacite atque mutuo date, nihil inde sperantes, tunc ei merces vestra multa, et eritis filii 
Altissimi, vi 27-36; </p>
<p>[4] ubi describitur bonum quod a Domino, et quod sit absque omni fine retributionis, quare qui in illo, vocantur `filii Patris Qui in caelis,' ac `filii Altissimi'; et quia 
in illo est Dominus, etiam est merces: apud Lucam, 	Quando feceris prandium aut cenam, ne voca amicos tuos, neque fratres tuos, neque cognatos tuos, neque vicinos divites, ne forte illi te vicissim vocent, 
fiatque tibi retributio; sed quando feceris convivium, voca pauperes, mancos, caecos, tunc beatus eris, quia non habent ad retribuendum, retribuetur tibi resurrectione mortuorum {4}, 	xiv 12-14; </p>
<p>`prandium, 
cena, convivium' est bonum charitatis, in quo cohabitatio Domini cum homine, n. 2341, quare per illud describitur, et manifeste patet, quod retributio sit in ipso bono, quia in illo Dominus, 
nam dicitur, `retribuetur in resurrectione mortuorum.'  [5] Qui bonum ex se, quia Dominus ita mandavit, facere student, ii sunt qui tandem accipiunt hoc bonum, et qui dein instructi agnoscunt fide 
quod omne bonum sit a Domino, n. 1712, 1937, 1947, et tunc aversantur ita meritum sui, ut cum modo cogitant de merito, contristentur, et percipiant beatum et felix apud eos in tantum diminui; aliter 
qui id non faciunt, sed agunt vitam mali, docendo et profitendo quod in fide separata sit salus; ii nec sciunt quod tale bonum dabile sit; et quod mirum; iidem in altera vita, quod a multa experientia 
scire datum, ex bonis quibuscumque quorum reminiscuntur, mereri volunt caelum, quia tunc primum sciunt quod in fide separata a charitate non sit salus; sed tunc sunt illi, de quibus Dominus apud Matthaeum, 	Dicent 
Mihi in illa die, Domine, Domine, nonne per nomen quum prophetavimus, et per nomen Tuum daemonia ejecimus, et in nomine Tuo virtutes multas fecimus? Sed tunc confitebor illis, Non novi 
vos, discedite a Me, operantes iniquitatem, vii 22, 23; </p>
<p>apud eosdem etiam apparet quod nihil prorsus attenderint ad omnia illa, quae Ipse Dominus de bono amoris et charitatis toties docuit, sed quod 
illa fuerint [iis] sicut nubes quae praetervolant, aut sicut visa in nocte, ut quae apud Matthaeum iii 8, 9; v 7-48; vi 1-20; vii 16-20, 24-27; ix 13; xii 33; xiii 8, 23; xviii 21, 22, 23 ad fin.; xix 
19; xxii 34-39; xxiv 12, 13; xxv 34 ad fin.; Marc. iv 18-20; xi 13, 14, 20; xii 28-35; Luc. iii 8, 9; vi 27-39, 43 {4} ad fin.; vii 47; viii 8, 14, 15; (x)25-28; xii 58, 59; xiii 6-10; Joh. iii 19, 
21; v 42; xiii 34, 35; xiv 14, 15, 20, 21, 23; xv 1-8, 9-19; xxi 15-17 {5}. Haec nunc et similia sunt quae significata sunt per quod `viri Sodomae,' hoc est, illi qui in malo, n. 2220, 2246, 2322, `dixerint 
ad Lotum, Num unus venit ad peregrinandum, et judicabit judicando?' hoc est: Qui alia doctrina et alia vita, num illi docebunt nos? 	@1 possit after bonam.$ 	@2 i quam.$ 	@3 est d queat.$ 	@4 
Sch. justorum, Gk. [ ] (dikaion). There is no record of any other reading.  In 6393 and 9263 S has justorum, in 9263 to illustrate justus, but in AE 695 and AR 639 he has mortuorum, in the latter 
to illustrate mortuus.$ 	@4 AI i iv 43-49, probably a confusion with vi 43-49.$ 	@5 i praeter alia.$ </p>
