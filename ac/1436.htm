<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1436节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1436.</strong>“他们在哈兰所得的灵魂”表可能存在于那个朦胧状态中的一切生命本质。这从“灵魂”和“哈兰”的含义清楚可知：“灵魂”是指生命的本质；“哈兰”是指一种朦胧的状态，这在前一节说过。灵魂的本义是指人里面的有生命之物，因而是指人的生命本身。在人里面，有生命的不是肉体，而是灵魂，肉体通过灵魂接受生命。人里面的生命本身，即有生命之物源于属天之爱；若非源于这爱，就不可能存在任何有生命之物。因此，“灵魂”在此表示通过属天之爱存活的良善，这良善就是基本的生命本质。从字义上看，“灵魂”在此是指每个人，以及一切牲畜，还有他们自己所积蓄之物，但在内义上，仅表示生命的本质，而非其它事物。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1436.</strong> The symbolism of and [every] soul that they had made in Haran as all the essential vitality that is possible in this shadowy state can be seen from the following: A soul symbolizes essential vitality, and Haran symbolizes a shadowy state, as described at the previous verse.<br />Strictly speaking, a soul symbolizes what is alive in us and so our life itself. It is not our body that lives but our soul; our body receives life through our soul. Our actual life force, or actual vitality, comes from heavenly love. Nothing living can possibly exist unless it derives from that source. So a soul here symbolizes a goodness whose living quality comes from heavenly love. This kind of goodness is genuinely essential and alive.<br />On the literal level, a soul here means every person and every animal that was alive and that they had acquired for themselves, but in an inner sense what it means is an essential vitality. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1436</b></p><p><b>1436.</b>
And the soul that they had gained in Haran. That this signifies every living essential that was possible in that obscure state, is evident from the signification of "soul," as being what is living essential; 
and from the signification of "Haran" as being an obscure state, concerning which see the preceding verse. The soul in the proper sense signifies that which lives in man, and thus his very life. 
That in man which lives is not the body, but the soul, and the body lives by means of the soul. The life itself of man, or the living part of him, is from celestial love; there cannot possibly be 
anything living which does not derive its origin from this; and therefore by "soul" is here signified the good which lives from celestial love, which good is the living essential itself. In the literal 
sense, by "soul" is here meant every man, and also every beast that was alive, and which they had procured for themselves; but in the internal sense nothing else is signified than what is living essential. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1436</b></p><p><b>1436.</b>
'And [every] soul which they had gained in Haran' means every essential with life in it that was possible in that obscure state. This is clear from the meaning of 'soul' as an essential that has life 
in it, and from the meaning of 'Haran' as an obscure state, dealt with in the previous verse. 'Soul' in the proper sense means that with man which possesses life, and so his life itself. That in man 
which has life in it is not the body but the soul, and it is through the soul that the body receives life. The life itself in man, that is, that which has life, is derived from heavenly love; nothing 
with life in it is possible if that love is not the source of it. This explains why 'soul' here means the good which derives its life from heavenly love, this good being the fundamental essential that 
has life in it. In the literal sense 'soul' is used here to mean every human being, and also all the livestock, and which they had acquired to themselves; but in the internal sense nothing else is meant 
than [every] essential with life in it. </p>

</p><b>1436.</b>
'Et animam quam fecerant in Haran':  quod significet omne essentiale vivum quod dabile in statu illo obscuro, constat ex significatione 'animae' quod sit essentiale vivum, et ex significatione 'Haranis' 
quod sit status obscurus, de qua vers. praec. 'Anima' in proprio sensu significat illud quod apud hominem vivit, ita ipsam ejus vitam; quod vivit apud hominem, non est corpus sed est anima, et per 
animam vivit corpus; ipsa vita hominis seu ipsum ejus vivum est ex amore caelesti; nusquam aliquod vivum dari potest nisi inde ducat originem, quare hic per 'animam' significatur bonum quod vivit ex 
amore caelesti, quod est ipsum essentiale vivum. In sensu litterali per animam intelligitur hic omnis homo, tum omnis bestia quae viva, et sibi comparaverunt, sed in sensu interno nihil aliud significatur 
quam essentiale vivum. </p>
