<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>322.</strong>有人认为灵并不拥有比世人更加敏锐的感觉，要警惕这个错误的观念。事实与此完全相反，在这方面我有千百次的亲身经历。对灵的性质先入为主的成见令他们不愿相信这一事实，那就让他们在来世通过亲身体验获知这一点吧，在此事实会迫使他们相信。首先，灵有视觉，因为他们生活在光中，善灵、天使灵和天使所在的光如此强烈，以至于世间正午之光也难以与之相比。蒙主怜悯，他们所生活和借以看见的光明容后详述。灵也拥有听觉，其敏锐程度是肉体听觉无法比拟的。数年来，他们与我保持对话，几乎没有间断。他们还拥有嗅觉。出于主的慈悲，他们的言辞和嗅觉也容后再述。他们有最敏锐的触觉，这在地狱会带来疼痛和折磨，因为所有感觉都与触觉相关，它们只是触觉的不同形式和变化而已。<br />他们拥有欲望和情感，也是在肉身时无法相比的，对此，出于主的慈悲，也容后再述。灵的思维比他们在肉身生活时更清晰明了。他们思维中的一个念头所包含的信息，比在世时上千个念头所包含的信息还要丰富。他们在一起谈话时，言辞十分敏锐、细腻、睿智和独特，世人若领会些许，必惊讶不已。<br />总之，灵拥有世人所拥有的一切，并且更加完善，只是没了血肉骨头及其缺陷。他们承认并觉察到，即便在肉身生活期间，有感觉的也是灵，尽管感觉官能表现在身体上，但它依旧不属肉体。因此，肉体被抛弃后，感觉就更加细腻完美。生命在于感觉，没有感觉就没有生命，有怎样的感觉就有怎样的生命，这一点不难理解。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]322.</strong> Avoid succumbing to the false opinion that spirits lack the power of sensation, and sensation much keener than they had while living in the body. I know the opposite to be true from thousands and thousands of experiences. If you do not want to believe, because of assumptions you make about the spirit, keep it to yourself when you enter the other life.{*1} There actual experience will make a believer out of you.<br />Spirits have eyesight, since they live in light, and good spirits, angelic spirits, and angels live in such bright light that the world's noonday light can hardly be compared to it. (More will be said later on [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_322/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1521" target=_top>1521-1534</a>], with the Lord's divine mercy, about the light that they live in and see by.)<br />Not only that, they also have hearing, and such sensitive hearing that their [former,] physical hearing cannot be measured against it. They have talked with me almost continually for several years now{*2} (but more about their speech will also be told later on [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_322/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1634" target=_top>1634-1650</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_322/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1757" target=_top>1757-1764</a>], with the Lord's divine mercy).<br />They have a sense of smell (also dealt with later [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_322/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1516" target=_top>1516</a>], with the Lord's divine mercy).<br />They have an extremely sensitive sense of touch, from which come the excruciating pangs of hell. All the senses relate to touch, since they are simply different varieties of it.{*3} [2] They have desires and feelings to which, again, the ones they had during physical existence cannot be compared. (These too will be expanded on below [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_322/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994#subsection-2-3" target=_top>994:3</a>], with the Lord's divine mercy.)<br />They think much more clearly and precisely than they did during the life of the body, packing more into a single mental image than they did into a thousand when they engaged in thought during bodily life.<br />They talk to each other with such great acumen, subtlety, wisdom, and clarity that if we perceived only part of what they said we would be astounded.<br />In short, they have lost absolutely nothing they need in order to be human — and more perfectly human at that — except flesh and bones, and the accompanying imperfections.<br />They acknowledge and perceive that during bodily life the spirit was what actually sensed things. Although sensation seemed to take place in their bodies it was not, in fact, physical. Consequently when the body has been laid aside, sensation lives on with much greater acuity and perfection. Life consists in sensation because without it there is no life, and the quality of sensation determines the quality of life, as anyone can recognize.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Although Swedenborg describes the spiritual world as a place of complete honesty, where any spoken words that diverge from the speaker's true opinions sound noticeably strained and harsh, people nevertheless retain the option of keeping silent; see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_322/swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_294" target=_top>Revelation Unveiled 294:1</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_322/swedenborg_divine-providence-dole_224#subsection-2-3" target=_top>Divine Providence 224:3</a>. [JSR]<br />{*2} For more details on the dates of Swedenborg's spiritual awakening, see note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_322/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5" target=_top>5</a>. [JSR]<br />{*3} What Swedenborg means here is that the five senses are simply different modes of detecting the impingement of various particles on the human body. He discusses his theory of the senses extensively in his unpublished manuscript of 1744, Draft on the Five Senses (Swedenborg 1976b). There he uses the term "touch" both in a general sense, as the detection of particles impinging on any organs of sense, and in its narrower meaning of "the sensation perceived by the nerve fibers of the skin." In <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_322/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_444" target=_top>444</a> of that work he states: "The origin of all sensation is from touch [in the broad sense], or external impulse... . The sensations of touch [in the narrow sense], taste, and smell arise from a touch [in the broad sense], or impulse of heavy particles, ... but the sense of hearing and of sight [is] from a touch, or impulse, of particles not heavy, but of active force, that is of particles of the atmosphere." See also his posthumously published manuscript Draft on Sensation (Swedenborg 1984), 150-151. Compare Aristotle On the Soul 3:12 (434b). [SS] </p>

Beware of the false notion that spirits do not possess far more exquisite sensations than during the life of the body. I know the contrary by experience repeated thousands of times. Should any be unwilling 
to believe this, in consequence of their preconceived ideas concerning the nature of spirit, let them learn it by their own experience when they come into the other life, where it will compel them 
to believe. In the first place spirits have sight, for they live in the light, and good spirits, angelic spirits, and angels, in a light so great that the noonday light of this world can hardly be 
compared to it. The light in which they dwell, and by which they see, will of the Lord's Divine mercy be described hereafter. Spirits also have hearing, hearing so exquisite that the hearing of the body 
cannot be compared to it. For years they have spoken to me almost continually, but their speech also will of the Lord's Divine mercy be described hereafter. They have also the sense of smell, which 
also will of the Lord's Divine mercy be treated of hereafter. They have a most exquisite sense of touch, whence come the pains and torments endured in hell; for all sensations have relation to the touch, 
of which they are merely diversities and varieties. They have desires and affections to which those they had in the body cannot be compared, concerning which of the Lord's Divine mercy more will 
be said hereafter. Spirits think with much more clearness and distinctness than they had thought during their life in the body.  There are more things contained within a single idea of their thought 
than in a thousand of the ideas they had possessed in this world. They speak together with so much acuteness, subtlety, sagacity, and distinctness, that if a man could perceive anything of it, it would 
excite his astonishment. In short, they possess everything that men possess, but in a more perfect manner, except the flesh and bones and the attendant imperfections. They acknowledge and perceive 
that even while they lived in the body it was the spirit that sensated, and that although the faculty of sensation manifested itself in the body, still it was not of the body; and therefore that when 
the body is cast aside, the sensations are far more exquisite and perfect. Life consists in the exercise of sensation, for without it there is no life, and such as is the faculty of sensation, such is 
the life, a fact that anyone may observe. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 322</b></p><p><b>322.</b>
Let people beware of falsely assuming that spirits do not possess far keener sensory powers than they did in the life of the body. From thousands of experiences I know that the reverse is true. But if, 
because of their presuppositions about the spirit, they are unwilling to believe it, let them find out for themselves when they enter the next life, where their own experience will force them to believe 
it. Not only do spirits have the gift of sight, since they are living in light; good spirits, angelic spirits, and angels also live in a light so bright that the light of this world at midday is 
scarcely comparable to it. The light in which they live and by which they see will in the Lord's Divine mercy be described later on. Spirits also have a sense of hearing so keen that the sense of hearing 
in their physical body cannot be reckoned its equal. For several years now, with scarcely any break, they have been holding conversations with me. But their speech also will in the Lord's Divine 
mercy be described later on. They have the sense of smell, which also will in the Lord's Divine mercy be described later on. They have a very delicate sense of touch, which in hell brings about pain and 
torment. For all sensations are related to the sense of touch; indeed they are just different forms and variations of that sense.  </p>

 They have desires and affections, with which those they had 
in the life of the body cannot be compared. More, in the Lord's Divine mercy, will be said about these later on. They are far more penetrating and discriminating in their thinking than they were during 
their lifetime. One idea of their thinking embodies more than a thousand ideas did during their lifetime. In what they say to one another they are so direct and to the point, so clear-cut and discriminating, 
that if man were to catch only a fraction of it he would be dumbfounded. To sum up, they have lost absolutely nothing; they are as men, yet more perfect, but without material flesh and bones 
and the imperfections that go with these. They acknowledge and perceive that even during their lifetime it was the spirit that was active in sensation, and that although it presented itself within the 
body, it still did not belong to the body. When therefore the body has been laid aside, sensations are far more excellent and perfect. Life consists in sensation, for no life is possible without sensation, 
and as is the sensation so is the life, a point which anyone is capable of knowing.  </p>

Caveant sibi ab opinione falsa quod spiritus sint absque sensitivo exquisitiore multo quam in vita corporis; contrarium scio a mille et mille experientiis; sique non credere velint ex causa suarum suppositionum 
de spiritu, habeant sibi, cum in alteram vitam veniunt, ubi ipsa experientia faciet eos credere: non solum habent visum, nam vivunt in luce, et spiritus boni, angelici et angeli in tanta 
luce ut lux meridiei in mundo ei vix comparari possit: de luce in qua vivunt et vident, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus: habent auditum, tam exquisitum ut auditus eorum in corpore non aequiparari 
possit; mecum locuti sunt nunc per aliquot annos fere continue; sed de loquela eorum etiam, ex Divina Domini misericordia, in sequentibus: habent olfactum, de quo etiam, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, 
in sequentibus: habent tactum exquisitissimum, inde dolores et cruciatus in inferno; nam ad tactum se referunt omnes sensationes, quae sunt modo diversitates et varietates tactus: habent cupiditates 
et affectiones, quibus nec comparari possunt eae quas habuerunt in vita corporis, de quibus plura, ex Divini Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus: cogitant multo perspicacius et distinctius quam 
cogitarunt in vita corporis; in una idea cogitationis plura involvunt quam in mille cum cogitarunt in vita corporis: loquuntur inter se ita acute, subtiliter, sagaciter et distincte, ut si perciperet 
homo modo aliquid de eo, obstupesceret: in summa, nihil prorsus amiserunt quin sint sicut homines sed perfectiones, praeter ossa et carnem et inde imperfectiones. Agnoscunt et percipiunt quod dum 
in corpore vixerunt, fuerit spiritus qui sensit, quod tametsi apparuit in corpore, usque non fuit corporis; quare rejecto corpore vivunt sensationes multo exquisitiores et perfectiones; vita consistit 
in sensu, nam absque sensu nulla vita, et qualis sensus talis vita quod cuivis potest notum esse. </p>
