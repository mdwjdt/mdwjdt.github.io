<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3217节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3217.</strong>当天使的讨论涉及心智的理性力部分时，就有马出现在他们之下的灵人界，也就是与他们相对应的社群。这些马的大小、体形、颜色、姿态和各种装饰，皆取决于天使对于理解力所持的观念。还有一个相当深的地方，靠右一点，被称为聪明人的居所。那里也经常出现马，这是因为那里的人在思考理解力；当讨论理解力的天使流入这些灵人的思维时，就会有马的形像出现。我由此明白先知们所看到的马，以及圣言别处所提及的马是什么意思，也就是说，它们表示理解力的各个方面（<a href="2760.htm">2760</a>-<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3217</b></p><p><b>3217.</b>
When the angels are discoursing of that which relates to the understanding, then in the world of spirits, beneath the angels, or in the corresponding societies, there appear horses; and these of a size, 
form, color, attitude, and varied equipment, in accordance with the ideas which the angels have concerning the understanding. There is also a place at some depth a little to the right, which is called 
the abode of the intelligent, where horses continually appear, and this by reason of those present being in thought about what is of the understanding; and when angels whose discourse is about this 
subject flow into their thoughts, there is a representation of horses. This shows what was signified by the horses seen by the prophets, and also by the horses mentioned elsewhere in the Word; namely, 
the things of the understanding (n. 2760-2762). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3217</b></p><p><b>3217.</b>
When angels' discussion has to do with the understanding part of the mind, horses appear in the world of spirits below them, that is, in the communities which correspond to them. The size, shape, colour, 
and stance of the horses depends on the ideas which the angels have concerning the understanding. The horses also carry differing adornments. There is also a place quite deep down and a little towards 
the right which is called the abode of the intelligent. There horses are seen constantly, the reason being that those there are engaged in thought about the understanding; and when the angels who 
are engaged in a discussion about the understanding flow into the thoughts of those spirits, horses are seen. From this I have come to see what was meant by the horses seen by the prophets, and also 
by the horses mentioned in the Word, namely aspects of the understanding, <a href="2760.htm">2760</a>-<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>. </p>

</p><b>3217.</b>
Cum (t)sermo est angelis de {1}intellectuali, tunc in mundo spirituum sub illis seu in societatibus quae correspondent, apparent equi, et hi magnitudine, forma, colore, positu, secundum ideas quas angeli 
de intellectuali habent, etiam illi varie phalerati. Est etiam locus aliquantum profunde paulo ad {2}dextrum, qui domicilium intelligentium vocatur, ubi equi continue apparent; et hoc ex causa quia 
in cogitatione sunt de intellectuali, in quorum cogitationes cum influunt angeli, quibus sermo de intellectuali, repraesentantur equi: inde constare potuit quid significatum per equos visos prophetis{3}, 
et quoque per equos in Verbo nominatos, quod nempe intellectualia, n. 2760-2762. @1 intellectualibus for intellectuali throughout    .$  @2 T alters to dextram (sc. manum), a more usual form, 
but S may have had dextrum latus in mind.  A is clearly dextrum.$  @3 i in verbo$  </p>
