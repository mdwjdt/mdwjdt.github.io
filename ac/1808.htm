<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1808节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1808.</strong>“数算众星”表良善与真理在内心视野中呈现为星座的形像。这从刚才所述，以及“众星”代表和表示良善和真理清楚可知。“众星”频繁出现在圣言中，处处表示良善和真理，在反面意义上则表示邪恶和虚假。或也可说，它们表示天使或天使社群，在反面意义上则表示恶灵及其同伙。当表示天使或天使社群时，它们是恒星；而当表示恶灵及其同伙时，它们是游荡的星星，对此，我经常看到。<br />天上和地上的一切事物都是属天和属灵之物的代表物。这一点从以下明显证据清楚可知：即与那些出现在肉眼面前的天上和地上之物相似的事物在灵人界也显为可见，并且清晰得如同在大白天出现。在灵人界，它们无非是代表物。例如，当星空出现，并且其中的星星一动不动时，人立时就知道它们表示良善和真理；而当游荡的星星出现时，人立时就知道它们表示邪恶和虚假。通过星星的发光和闪耀就能清楚得知它们的性质，此外还有无数其它事物。因此，人若愿意智慧地思考，就能知道世上万物起源于何处，即起源于主。这些事物之所以不以非物质的观念形式，而是以实际物体出现在世上，是因为一切事物，无论属天的还是属灵的，皆源于主。它们都是活生生的，是本质的，或实质的（如它们被称呼的那样），故以实际物体出现在终极的自然界中（参看<a href="1632.htm">1632</a>节）。<br />“众星”代表和表示良善和真理，这从以下圣言经文清楚看出来。以赛亚书：<br />天上的众星群宿都不发光，日头一出，就变黑暗；月亮也不放光。我必因邪恶刑罚世界，因罪孽刑罚恶人。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.10.htm">13:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.11.htm">11</a>）<br />这里论述的主题是刑罚临到的日子。谁都能看出，“众星群宿”在此并非表示真的众星群宿，而是表示真理和良善；“日头”表爱；“月亮”表信；因为所论述的是“变黑暗”的邪恶和虚假。<br />以西结书：<br /><br />我将你扑灭的时候，要把天遮蔽，使众星昏暗，以密云遮掩太阳，月亮也不放光。我必使亮光都在你以上变为昏暗，使你的地上黑暗。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结32.7.htm">32:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结32.8.htm">8</a>）<br />此处的意思一样。约珥书：<br />在祂面前地震天动，日月昏暗，星宿无光。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.10.htm">2:10</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥3.15.htm">3:15</a>）<br />此处的意思一样。诗篇：<br />赞美耶和华，日头、月亮，你们要赞美祂！放光的星宿，你们都要赞美祂！天上的天，你们都要赞美祂！<br />此处的意思也一样。<br />“众星”并非表示真的星星，而是表示良善和真理，或也可说，表示完全处于良善和真理之人，如天使那样。这在启示录中清楚阐明：<br />我看见人子右手拿着七星。论到你所看见、在我右手中的七星和七个金灯台的奥秘，那七星就是七个教会的使者，而你所看到的七灯台就是七个教会。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.16.htm">1:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.20.htm">20</a>）<br /><br />第四位天使吹号，日头的三分之一，月亮的三分之一，星辰的三分之一都被击打，以致日月星的三分之一黑暗了，白昼的三分之一没有光，黑夜也是这样。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启8.12.htm">8:12</a>）<br />显而易见，此处黑暗的是良善和真理。但以理书：<br />有一角长出一个小角，向南、向东、向荣美之地，渐渐成为强大。它渐渐强大，高及天象，将一些天象和星宿抛落在地，用脚践踏。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.9.htm">8:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.10.htm">10</a>）<br />显然，被“践踏”的“天象”和“星宿”是指良善和真理。<br />由上述经文也可以明白主在马太福音中所说这些话的意思：<br />在世界的末了，那些日子的灾难一过去，日头就变黑了，月亮也不放光，众星要从天上坠落，天势都要震动。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.29.htm">24:29</a>）<br />路加福音：<br />日、月、星辰要显出异兆，地上的列族也有困苦，因海洋波涛的咆哮，就慌慌不定。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路21.25.htm">21:25</a>）<br />此处“日”根本不是指太阳，“月”也不是指月亮，“星辰”不是指星星，“海洋”不是指海洋，而分别表示它们所代表之物。也就是说，“日”表属天事物，“月”表属灵事物，“星辰”表良善和真理，或对良善和真理的认知，它们在接近没有信，即没有仁爱的世界末了都变黑了。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1808.</strong> And count the stars symbolizes a representation of goodness and truth when one is gazing at the constellations. This can be seen from the discussion just above and also from the representation and symbolism of stars as goodness and truth. The Word mentions stars quite often, and every time it does they symbolize goodness and truth or, in the negative sense, evil and falsity. To put the same thing another way, they symbolize angels or communities of angels and, in a negative sense, evil spirits and their assemblages. Stars that stand for angels and their communities are fixed, but those that stand for evil spirits and their assemblages wander. Wandering stars appear very often [in the other world].<br />[2] A plain sign that everything in the heavens and on earth represents heavenly and spiritual traits was visible to me in this: that the same celestial and terrestrial sights appearing before our eyes also present themselves to view in the world of spirits. Such sights are as clear as day there, where they are nothing but representations. For example, when the stars come out and they are standing still, it is instantly recognized that they symbolize what is good and true. When wandering stars appear, it is instantly recognized that they symbolize what is evil and false. The very gleam and twinkle of the stars indicates the quality. Not to mention countless other phenomena. Anyone who is willing to think wisely can see from this where it is that everything on earth comes from — namely, the Lord. The reason things manifest themselves physically rather than metaphysically on earth is that all heavenly and spiritual entities from the Lord are alive and real. (These are called "substantial."){*1} So they also manifest themselves physically in the outermost, natural world. See <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1808/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1632" target=_top>1632</a>.<br />[3] The following passages in the Word show that stars represent and symbolize goodness and truth. In Isaiah:<br />The stars of the heavens and their constellations do not shed their light; the sun has been shadowed over in its emergence, and the moon does not radiate its light. And I will punish the world for its evil and the ungodly for their wickedness. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1808/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_13_10-11" target=_top>Isaiah 13:10-11</a>)<br />This is about a day of punishment. Anyone can see that the stars and constellations mean not stars and constellations but true ideas and good impulses; that the sun means love, and the moon, faith. After all, it is talking about false ideas and evil impulses that cast a shadow.<br />[4] In Ezekiel:<br />When I blot you out I will cover the heavens; I will black out their stars; the sun I will cover with a cloud, and the moon will not make its light shine. All the lamps of light I will black out above you, and I will bring shadow over your land. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1808/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_32_7-8" target=_top>Ezekiel 32:7-8</a>)<br />The meaning is similar. In Joel:<br />Before him the earth shook, the heavens trembled, the sun and moon turned black, and the stars withdrew their rays. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1808/bible_king-james-version_joel_2_10" target=_top>Joel 2:10</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1808/bible_king-james-version_joel_3_15" target=_top>3:15</a>)<br />The meaning is similar. In David:<br />Praise Jehovah, sun and moon! Praise him, all you shining stars! Praise him, heavens of heavens! (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1808/bible_king-james-version_psalms_148_3-4" target=_top>Psalms 148:3-4</a>)<br />The meaning is similar.<br />[5] John says explicitly that "stars" do not mean stars; they mean what is good and true or, to put it another way, people committed to what is good and true, such as angels:<br />I saw the Son of Humankind, having in his right hand seven stars. "The mysteries of the seven stars that you saw atop my right hand, and the seven lampstands: The seven stars are angels of the seven churches. But the seven lampstands that you saw are seven churches." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1808/bible_king-james-version_revelation_1_16" target=_top>Revelation 1:16</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1808/bible_king-james-version_revelation_1_20" target=_top>20</a>)<br />[6] In the same author:<br />The fourth angel trumpeted, so that a third of the sun was struck and a third of the moon and a third of the stars, so that a third of them would be shadowed over and the day would not shine for a third of it and the night likewise. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1808/bible_king-james-version_revelation_8_12" target=_top>Revelation 8:12</a>)<br />It is quite plain here that goodness and truth are what were shadowed over. In Daniel:<br />One small horn went out and grew mostly toward the south and toward the sunrise and toward the ornament [of Israel],{*2} and it grew right to the army of the heavens and threw down to the ground some of the army and some of the stars and trampled them. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1808/bible_king-james-version_daniel_8_9-10" target=_top>Daniel 8:9-10</a>)<br />Clearly the army of the heavens and the stars are goodness and truth, and these are what were trampled.<br />[7] From this can be seen what the Lord meant by these words in Matthew:<br />At the close of the age, immediately after the affliction of those days, the sun will go dark, and the moon will not shed its light, and the stars will fall down from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1808/bible_king-james-version_matthew_24_1-51" target=_top>Matthew 24</a>:<br />[3], 29)<br />And in Luke:<br />Then there will be signs in sun and moon and stars; and on earth, the distress of nations in despair, as sea and surf make noise. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1808/bible_king-james-version_luke_21_25" target=_top>Luke 21:25</a>)<br />Not in the least does the sun here mean the sun; or the moon, the moon; the stars, the stars; the sea, the sea; they each mean whatever they represent. The sun symbolizes heavenly aspects of love; the moon, spiritual aspects; the stars, goodness and truth, or knowledge of goodness and truth. Around the close of the age, when there is no faith, which is to say no charity, they will be darkened in this way.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg's unpublished work Draft on Ontology, written before or during 1742 (Swedenborg 1901), sheds some light on this passage, though it is always necessary to use caution when importing his definitions of standard theological and philosophical terms from his pretheological works to his theological works. According to his understanding in Draft on Ontology, the Lord is the primary substance. Yet substances that derive from the Lord "cannot be called non-substances... . Every form distinct from another is a substance... . Thus substance remains substance even though the state of its form is changed; for nothing substantial is either destroyed or produced by variation of form or modification" (Swedenborg 1901, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1808/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_33" target=_top>33</a>). It is for this reason that "heavenly and spiritual entities from the Lord are alive and real;" these are the "things ... called substantial," that is, the "substantials" (Latin substantialia), referred to here. [SS]<br />{*2} See note 4 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1808/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_458" target=_top>458</a> on the "ornament [of Israel]."

And number the stars. That this signifies a representation of what is good and true in a mental view of the constellations, is evident from what has just been said; and also from the representation and 
signification of "the stars," as being things good and true. The "stars" are frequently mentioned in the Word, and everywhere they signify things good and true, and also, in the contrary sense, things 
evil and false; or what is the same, they signify angels or societies of angels, and also in the contrary sense evil spirits and their associations. When they signify angels or societies of angels, 
they are then fixed stars; but when evil spirits and their associations, they are wandering stars, as I have very frequently seen.  [2] That all things in the skies and on the earth are representative 
of celestial and spiritual things, has been evidenced by this plain indication, that things similar to those which appear before the eyes in the sky and on the earth, are also presented to view in 
the world of spirits, and this as plainly as in clear day; and there they are nothing but representatives. For instance, when the starry heaven appears, and the stars therein are fixed, it is instantly 
known that they signify things good and true; and when the stars appear wandering, it is instantly known that they signify things evil and false. From the very glow and sparkle of the stars it may 
also be known of what kind they are; besides numberless other things. Hence, if one is willing to think wisely, he may know what is the origin of all things on the earth, namely, that it is the Lord; 
and the reason why they come forth on the earth not ideally but actually, is that all things, both celestial and spiritual, which are from the Lord, are living and essential, or as they are called substantial, 
and therefore they come forth into actual existence in ultimate nature (see n. 1632).  [3] That the stars represent and signify things good and true, may be seen from the following passages 
in the Word. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The stars of the heavens and the constellations thereof shine not with their light; the sun has been darkened in his going forth, and the moon doth not cause her light to 
shine; and I will visit evil upon the world, and their iniquity upon the wicked (Isa. 13:10-11); </p>
<p>where the day of visitation is treated of. Everyone can see that by "the stars" and "constellations" 
here are not meant the stars and constellations, but things true and good; and by "the sun," love; and by "the moon," faith; for the evils and falsities which cause darkness are treated of.  [4] In 
Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     When I shall extinguish thee I will cover the heavens, and make the stars thereof black; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not make her light to shine; all the luminaries 
of light I will make black over thee, and will set darkness upon thy land (Ezek. 32:7-8), where the meaning is similar. In Joel: </p>
<p>     The earth quaked before Him, the heavens trembled, the sun 
and the moon were blackened, and the stars withdrew their shining (Joel 2:10; 3:15), where the meaning is similar. In David: </p>
<p>     Praise Jehovah, sun and moon; praise Him, all ye stars of light; praise 
Him, ye heavens of heavens (Ps. 148:3-4), meaning the same.  [5] That by the "stars" are not meant the stars, but things good and true, or what is the same, those who are in things good and true, 
as the angels are, is plainly said in John: </p>
<p>     I saw the Son of man; and He had in His right hand seven stars. The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest upon My right hand, and the seven 
candlesticks: the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches (Rev. 1:13, 16, 20). [6] Again: </p>
<p>     The fourth angel sounded, 
so that the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; that the third part of them should be darkened, and the day shone not for the third part 
of it, and the night in like manner (Rev. 8:12), where it is clearly evident that what is good and true was darkened. In Daniel: </p>
<p>     There came forth a little horn, which grew exceedingly toward 
the south and toward the east and toward adornment [decus] and it grew even to the army of the heavens; and some of the army and of the stars it cast down to the earth, and trampled upon them (Dan. 8:9-10), which 
words plainly show that "the army of the heavens" and "the stars" are things good and true, which were trampled upon.  [7] From these passages may be seen what is meant by the words of 
the Lord in Matthew: </p>
<p>     In the consummation of the age, immediately after the affliction of those days, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from 
heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken (Matt. 24:29). And in Luke: </p>
<p>     There shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations in 
despair, the sea and the waves roaring (Luke 21:25); </p>
<p>where by "the sun" the sun is not meant at all, nor by "the moon" the moon, nor by "the stars" the stars, nor by "the sea" the sea; but the things 
which they represent, namely, by "the sun" the celestial things of love, by "the moon" the spiritual things, by "the stars" things good and true, that is, the knowledges of what is good and true, which 
are thus darkened near the consummation of the age, when there is no faith, that is, no charity. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1808</b></p><p><b>1808.</b>
'And count the stars' means a representation of goods and truths in a mental view of the constellations. This is clear from what has just been stated, and also from the representation and meaning of 
'the stars' as goods and truths. Stars are mentioned many times in the Word, and in every instance they mean goods and truths, and also in the contrary sense evils and falsities. Or what amounts to the 
same, they mean angels or communities of angels, and also in the contrary sense evil spirits and groupings of these. When angels or communities of angels are meant they are stars that are motionless, 
but when evil spirits and groupings of these are meant, they are stars that wander, as I have seen on many occasions. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that everything in the sky above and on the earth beneath is representative 
of celestial and spiritual things has become clear from the plain evidence that things similar to those that appear before the eyes in the sky and on the earth are also manifested visually 
in the world of spirits, and this as clearly as in broad daylight. There they are nothing other than representatives. For example, when a starry sky appears and the stars in it are motionless one knows 
instantly that they mean goods and truths; and when the stars appear wandering one knows instantly that they mean evils and falsities. And from the way in which the stars shine and sparkle the nature 
of them is made clear too, besides countless other considerations. Consequently if anyone is willing to be wise in his thinking he may know where all things on earth originate, namely in the Lord. 
And the reason why these things do not present themselves on earth in non-physical ideas but in actual physical objects is that all things, both celestial and spiritual, which derive from the Lord are 
living and essential, or substantial (as they are called), and therefore manifest themselves as actual objects within the natural order, see <a href="1632.htm">1632</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That 'the stars' represents and means goods and 
truths becomes clear from the following places in the Word: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The stars of the heavens and their constellations do not give their light. The sun is darkened in its going forth, and the 
moon does not shed its light And I will punish the world for evil, and the wicked for their iniquity. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2013:10,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 13:10, 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The subject here is the day of a visiting with punishment. Anyone may see that 
here 'the stars' and 'the constellations' are not used to mean stars and constellations but truths and goods, 'the sun' to mean love, and 'the moon' to mean faith; for falsities and evils which 'darken' 
are being referred to. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
When I have blotted you out I will cover the heavens; I will darken their stars. I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon will not give its light. 
All the bright lights I will make dark over you, and I will put darkness over your land. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2032:7,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 32:7, 8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the meaning is similar. In Joel, </p>
<blockquote>
The earth quaked before Him, the heavens trembled. 
The sun and the moon were darkened, and the stars withdrew their shining. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%202:10;%203:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 2:10; 3:15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the meaning is similar. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Praise Jehovah, sun and moon, praise Him, all stars of light! Praise 
Him, heavens of heavens! <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20148:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 148:3, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the meaning is similar. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 That 'stars' does not mean stars but goods and truths, or what amounts to the same, people who are wholly taken up with 
goods and truths, as angels are, is stated plainly in John, </p>
<blockquote>
I saw the Son of Man holding in His right hand seven stars. As for the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand, and 
the seven lampstands, the seven stars are the angels of the seven Churches; while the seven lampstands which you saw are the seven Churches. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%201:16,%2020&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 1:16, 20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
The fourth angel 
sounded, and a third part of the sun was struck, and a third part of the moon, and a third part of the stars, so that a third part of them was darkened, and the day did not shine for a third part of 
it, and the night likewise. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%208:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 8:12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here it is quite clear that good and truth were darkened. In Daniel, </p>
<blockquote>
There came forth a little horn, and it grew very much towards the south, and towards 
the east, and towards the glorious [land]. And it grew even towards the host of heaven, and cast down to earth some of the host, and of the stars, and trampled on them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%208:9,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 8:9, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly 'the host 
of heaven' and 'the stars' are goods and truths, which were 'trampled on'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 These places also show what is meant by the Lord's words in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
At the close of the age, immediately after 
the affliction of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2024:29&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 24:29</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in 
Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
There will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and upon the earth distress of nations in despair, at the roaring of the sea and of the ocean. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2021:25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 21:25</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the sun' does not at all mean 
the sun, nor 'the moon' the moon, nor 'stars' the stars, nor 'sea' the sea, but the things which these represent; that is to say, 'the sun' means the celestial things of love, 'moon' the spiritual 
things, 'stars' goods and truths, or cognitions of good and truth, which around the close of the age when no faith, that is, no charity, exists, are thus darkened. </p>

'Et numera stellas': quod significet repraesentationem bonorum et verorum in siderum intuitione, constat ab illis quae nunc dicta sunt, tum a repraesentatione et significatione 'stellarum' quod sint 
bona et vera; stellae in Verbo pluries memorantur et ubivis significant bona et vera, etiam in contrario sensu mala et falsa; seu quod idem est, angelos seu angelorum societates, tum in contrario sensu 
spiritus malos et eorum consortia; cum angelos seu angelorum societates, tunc sunt stellae fixae, at cum spiritus malos et eorum consortia, tunc sunt stellae errantes, quae multoties visae.  [2] Quod 
omnia quae in caelis et in terris sunt, repraesentativa caelestium et spiritualium sint, inde constare manifesto indicio potuit quod similia quae coram oculis apparent in caelo et in terra, etiam sistantur 
videnda in mundo spirituum, et hoc tam manifeste sicut in clara die, et ibi non sunt nisi repraesentativa; sicut dum apparet caelum stelliferum et stellae ibi fixae, ilico noscitur quod significent 
bona et vera; et cum apparent stellae errantes, ilico noscitur quod significent mala et falsa; ex ipsa rutilatione et scintillatione stellarum constare quoque potest qualia sunt: praeter innumerabilia 
alia; inde si quis sapienter velit cogitare, scire potest unde est ortus omnium in tellure, quod nempe a Domino; et quod in tellure non idealiter sed actualiter existant, est quia omnia et caelestia 
et spiritualia quae a Domino, viva et essentialia sunt, seu ut appellantur, substantialia, quare in ultima natura etiam actualiter existunt, videatur n. 1632.  [3] Quod 'stellae' repraesentent 
et significent bona et vera, constare potest ab his in Verbo locis; apud Esaiam,     	Stellae caelorum et sidera eorum non lucent luce sua; obtenebratus est sol in egressu suo, et luna non splendere 
facit lucem suam; et visitabo super orbem malum, et super impios iniquitatem eorum, xiii 10 [11]; </p>
<p>ubi de die visitationis; quisque videre potest quod per 'stellas et sidera' hic non intelligantur stellae 
et sidera, sed vera et bona, et per 'solem' amor, perque 'lunam' fides; nam agitur de falsis et malis quae 'obtenebrant': [4] apud Ezechielem,  	Obtegam, cum exstinxero te, caelos; atrabo stellas 
eorum; solem nube obtegam, et luna non lucere faciet lucem suam; omnia luminaria lucis atrabo super te, et dabo tenebras super terram tuam, xxxii 7, 8;  similiter: apud Joelem,  	Coram Ipso commota 
est terra, contremuerunt caeli; sol et luna atrati sunt, et stellae contraxerunt splendorem 	suum, ii 10; iv 15; </p>
<p>similiter: apud Davidem, 	Laudate Jehovam sol et luna, laudate Ipsum omnes stellae 
lucis, laudate Ipsum caeli caelorum, Ps. cxlviii 3, 4;  similiter.  [5] Quod per 'stellas' non stellae, sed bona et vera seu quod idem, qui in bonis et veris, sicut angeli, significentur, manifeste dicitur 
apud Johannem, 	Vidi Filium Hominis habentem in dextra sua manu stellas septem:... (x)mysterium septem stellarum, quas vidisti super dextra mea, et septem candelabra; septem stellae, angeli 	septem 
Ecclesiarum sunt; septem autem candelabra, quae 	vidisti, septem Ecclesiae sunt, Apoc. i [16,] 20: </p>
<p>[6] apud eundem, 	Quartus angelus clanxit, ita ut percussa sit tertia pars solis, et tertia pars 
lunae, et tertia pars stellarum, ut obtenebraretur tertia pars eorum, et dies non luceret tertia sui parte, et nox similiter, Apoc. viii 12; </p>
<p>hic quod bonum et verum obtenebratum sit, clare constat: 
apud Danielem, 	Exivit cornu unum exiguum, et crevit plurimum ad meridiem, et ad ortum, et ad decus, et crevit usque ad 	exercitum caelorum, et dejecit in terram de exercitu, et de stellis, et conculcavit 
eas, viii 9, 10; </p>
<p>manifeste quod 'exercitus caelorum et stellae' sint bona et vera, quae 'conculcata.' Ex his constare potest, quid intellectum per haec Domini verba, apud Matthaeum, 	In consummatione 
saeculi, 'statim post affectionem dierum istorum, sol obscurabitur, et luna non dabit lumen suum, et stellae cadent de caelo, et virtutes caelorum commovebuntur, xxiv 29: </p>
<p>et apud Lucam, 	Tunc 
erunt signa in sole et luna et astris, et super 	terra, angustia gentium in desperatione, resonante mari et salo, xxi 25; </p>
<p>ubi nusquam per 'solem' significatur sol, nec per 'lunam' luna, nec per 
'stellas' stellae, nec per 'mare' mare, sed illa quae repraesentant, nempe per 'solem' caelestia amoris, per 'lunam' spiritualia, per 'stellas' bona et vera, seu cognitiones boni et veri, quae circa consummationem 
saeculi, cum nulla fides, hoc est, nulla charitas, ita 'obtenebrantur.' </p>
