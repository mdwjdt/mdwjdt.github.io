<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>213.</strong>“知道自己赤身露体”，表示他们发现并承认自己已落入恶中，不再像从前那样天真无邪。因为上一章最后一节说，“夫妻二人赤身露体，并不羞耻”，乃表示他们天真无邪。此处觉得羞耻，“便编织无花果树的叶子，为自己作裙子”，自然就表示他们已不再天真无邪。因为当天真失落了，赤身就被认为是一种羞耻，因有邪恶的思想意识在其中。<br />是故，在圣经中，“赤身”被用来代表羞耻和罪恶，描述一个已颠倒的教会，例如：“你赤身露体，滚在血中。”（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.22.htm">16:22</a>）又如：“留下你赤身露体，裸体暴露。”（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.29.htm">23:29</a>）再如：“我劝你买白衣穿上，叫你赤身的羞耻不露出来。”（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.18.htm">3:18</a>）再如：“那警醒，看守衣服，免得赤身而行，叫人见他羞耻的，有福了。”（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启16.15.htm">16:15</a>）这是说末后的日子。再如：“人若发现妻子有什么赤裸之事，就可以写休书休她。”（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申24.1.htm">24:1</a>）因同样的缘故，亚伦和他的儿子在就近祭坛供职时，要穿细麻布的裤子，“以遮掩赤身，免得担罪而死”（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.42.htm">28:42</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.43.htm">43</a>）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]213.</strong> They realized that they were naked means that they recognized and admitted that they were living in evil and not in the innocence they had had before. This can be deduced from the last verse of the previous chapter, where it says, "And they were both naked, the human and his wife, and did not blush." Their lack of embarrassment over their nakedness symbolizes their innocence, as may be seen there [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_213/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_163" target=_top>163-165</a>].<br />The symbolism is just the opposite when they do show embarrassment, as is the case here, where they sewed fig leaves together and hid themselves. When innocence is lacking in us, nakedness is a matter of shame and scandal because we are conscious of wrong thoughts.{*1} For this reason, nudity in the Word is seen as a bad and shameful thing and is used to portray a perverted church. Ezekiel, for instance, says that the church was naked, bare, and trampled in its blood (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_213/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_16_7" target=_top>Ezekiel 16:7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_213/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_16_22" target=_top>22</a>). In the same author:<br />Let them leave her naked and bare, and let her nakedness be unveiled. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_213/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_23_29" target=_top>Ezekiel 23:29</a>)<br />In John:<br />I advise you to buy white clothes, so that you will be dressed and the shame of your nakedness will not be exposed. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_213/bible_king-james-version_revelation_3_18" target=_top>Revelation 3:18</a>)<br />And concerning the last days:<br />Fortunate are those who are watchful and keep their clothes, to avoid walking naked and letting others see their shame. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_213/bible_king-james-version_revelation_16_15" target=_top>Revelation 16:15</a>)<br />In Deuteronomy:<br />If a man finds any nakedness whatever in his wife, let him write her a document of divorce. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_213/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_24_1" target=_top>Deuteronomy 24:1</a>)<br />Likewise Aaron and his sons were required to have linen shorts to cover the flesh of their nakedness when they approached the altar to minister; otherwise they would bear their sin and die (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_213/bible_king-james-version_exodus_28_42-43" target=_top>Exodus 28:42-43</a>).<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} See <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_213/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1073" target=_top>1073</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_213/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1079" target=_top>1079</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_213/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1088" target=_top>1088</a>, where Swedenborg discusses the symbolism of Noah's nakedness.

By "knowing that they were naked" is signified their knowing and acknowledging themselves to be no longer in innocence as before, but in evil, as is evident from the last verse of the preceding chapter, 
where it is said, "and they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed" and where it may be seen that "not to be ashamed because they were naked" signifies to be innocent. The contrary 
is signified by their "being ashamed" as in this verse, where it is said that they "sewed fig-leaves together, and hid themselves;" for where there is no innocence, nakedness is a scandal and disgrace, 
because it is attended with a consciousness of thinking evil. For this reason "nakedness" is used in the Word as a type of disgrace and evil, and is predicated of a perverted church, as in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>Thou 
wast naked and bare, and trampled on in thy blood (Ezek. 16:22). Again: </p>
<p>     They shall leave her naked and bare, and the nakedness shall be uncovered (Ezek. 23:29). In John: </p>
<p>     I counsel 
thee to buy of Me white raiment that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear (Rev. 3:18). And concerning the last day: </p>
<p>     Blessed is he who watcheth, and keepeth 
his garments, lest he walk naked and they see his shame (Rev. 16:15). In Deuteronomy: </p>
<p>     If a man hath found some nakedness in his wife, let him write her a bill of divorcement (Deut. 24:1). For 
the same reason Aaron and his sons were commanded to have linen breeches when they came to the altar, and to minister, to "cover the flesh of their nakedness, lest they should bear iniquity, and 
die" (Exod. 28:42-43). </p>

'Knowing that they were naked' means knowing and acknowledging that they did not dwell in innocence, as they had done previously, but were under the influence of evil. This is clear from the final verse 
of the previous chapter, where it is said, 'And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and they were not ashamed'. There it may be seen that being naked and not ashamed means being innocent. 
The contrary is meant when they are ashamed, as in this chapter which says that they sewed fig leaves together and hid themselves. Indeed when innocence is lacking nakedness arouses feelings of shame 
and disgrace because people are made aware of their own evil thoughts. Consequently nakedness in the Word stands for evil and shame and has reference to a corrupted Church, as in Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
She was 
naked and bare, and was downtrodden in her own blood. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2016:7,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 16:7, 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
Let them leave her naked and bare, and let her nakedness be uncovered. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2023:29&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 23:29</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In John,  </p>
<blockquote>
I 
counsel you to buy white garments to clothe you, and let not the shame of your nakedness be manifested. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%203:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 3:18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And in reference to Judgement Day,  </p>
<blockquote>
Blessed is he who is awake and keeps his 
garments, so that he may not walk naked, and men see his shame <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2016:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 16:15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Deuteronomy,  </p>
<blockquote>
If a man has found in his wife some nakedness, let him write her a bill of divorce. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2024:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 24:1</a>.  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
This 
also was why Aaron and his sons were commanded to have linen breeches to cover their naked flesh when they approached the altar to serve, lest they should bring iniquity upon themselves and die, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2028:42,43&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 28:42,43</a>.

Quod per 'cognoscere quod nudi' significatur quod cognoverint et agnoverint se non, ut prius, in innocentia esse sed in malo constat a versu ultimo capitis praecedentis ubi dicitur 'Et fuerunt ambo 
nudi, homo et uxor ejus, et non erubuerunt;' ubi 'non erubescere quod nudi' significare innocentes esse, ibi videatur. Contrarium significatur cum erubescunt, ut hic quod 'consuerint folia ficus, seque 
occultaverint.' Cum enim in nulla innocentia, tunc nuditas est probro et scandalo quia sibi conscii quod male cogitent; inde 'nuditas' pro probro et malo accipitur in Verbo et praedicatur de Ecclesia 
perversa ut apud Ezechielem, 	Quod esset nuda, et denudata, et conculcata in sanguine suo, xvi 7, 22: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Relinquant eam nudam et denudatam, et reveletur nuditas xxiii 29: </p>
<p>apud Johannem, 	Consulo 
tibi, ut emas... vestimenta alba, ut induaris, et non manifestetur pudor nuditatis tuae, Apoc. iii 18: </p>
<p>deque ultimo die, 	Beatus qui vigilat, et servat vestimenta sua, ut non nudus ambulet, 
{1} videantque pudorem ejus, Apoc. xvi 15: </p>
<p>in Deuteronomio, 	Si vir invenerit in uxore nuditatem quamcumque, scribat ei libellum repudii, xxiv 1: </p>
<p>quare etiam Aharoni et filiis ejus mandatum, 	Ut 
femoralia lini haberent, cum accederent ad altare, et administrandum, ad tegendum carnem nuditatis, ne portent iniquitatem, et moriantur, Exod. xxviii 42, 43. @	1 videatque I.$ </p>
