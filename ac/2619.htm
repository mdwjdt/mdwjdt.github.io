<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2619节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2619.</strong>“照祂所讲的”（speaking）表照祂所想的。这从“讲”（speaking）的含义清楚可知，“讲”（speaking）是指思考（参看<a href="2271.htm">2271</a>，<a href="2287.htm">2287</a>节）。“耶和华说”所表示的直觉是从神性属天之物流出的，而“耶和华讲”所表示的思维则是从神性属天之物经由神性属灵之物流出的。这就解释了为何字面上会出现明显的重复，即“按着祂所说的话”和“照祂所讲的”。不过，至于何为通过神性属天之物发觉，何为通过神性属天之物经由神性属灵之物思考，人无法通过属尘世之光的事物来理解，无论怎样被启示。这表明圣言中的其它一切事物必是何等无限。思维来自直觉，这一点可参看前文（<a href="1919.htm">1919</a>，<a href="2515.htm">2515</a>节）。对世人来说，情况是这样：他通过良善觉察，但凭借真理思考。良善存在于爱及其情感中，并因此成为直觉的源头；而真理存在于信中，信因此伴随着思维。在圣言的历史部分，前者用“说”（saying）来表示，而后者用“讲”（speaking）来表示。然而，只用“说”这个词时，它有时表示发觉，有时表示思考，因为“说”（saying）包含这二者。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2619</b></p><p><b>2619.</b>
As He had spoken. That this signifies as He had thought, is evident from the signification of "speaking," as being to think (see n. 2271, 2287). The perception which is signified by "Jehovah said" was 
from the Divine celestial; but the thought which is signified by "Jehovah spoke" was from the Divine celestial through the Divine spiritual; and there is therefore an apparent repetition in the sense 
of the letter, namely, "as He said," and "as He spake." But what it is to perceive from the Divine celestial and to think from the Divine celestial through the Divine spiritual, does not fall into even 
the most enlightened apprehension by means of things that belong to the light of the world. This shows how infinite the rest of the Word may be. (That thought is from perception may be seen above, 
n. 1919, 2515.) With man the case is this: it is good from which he perceives, but it is truth by means of which he thinks. Good is of love and its affections, consequently from it is perception; but 
truth is of faith, consequently this is of thought. The former is signified in the historic parts of the Word by "saying," but the latter by "speaking." But when "saying" is found alone, it then sometimes 
signifies perceiving, and sometimes thinking; because "saying" involves both. </p>

'As He had spoken' means as He had thought. This is clear from the meaning of 'speaking' as thinking, dealt with in <a href="2271.htm">2271</a>, <a href="2287.htm">2287</a>. Perception, which is meant by 'Jehovah said', flowed from the Divine celestial, 
but thought, which is meant by 'Jehovah spoke', flowed from the Divine celestial by way of the Divine spiritual. This explains why in the sense of the letter there occurs an apparent repetition, 
namely 'as He had said' and 'as He had spoken'. But what perceiving from the Divine celestial is, and what thinking from the Divine celestial by way of the Divine spiritual, does not come within the 
range of even the most enlightened capacity to understand by means of the things which belong to the light of the world. This shows how infinite everything else [in the Word] must be. The fact that 
thought stems from perception, see <a href="1919.htm">1919</a>, <a href="2515.htm">2515</a>. With man the position is that good is the source from which he perceives, but truth the means by which he thinks. Good exists in love and its affections, 
and for that reason is the source of perception, whereas truth exists in faith, and for that reason faith goes with thought. The former is meant in historical parts of the Word by 'saying', but the 
latter by 'speaking'. When only the expression 'saying' is used however, it sometimes means perceiving and sometimes thinking, because 'saying' includes both. </p>

</p><b>2619.</b>
`Quemadmodum locutus est':  quod significet sicut cogitavit, constat (c)a significatione `loqui' quod sit cogitare, de qua n. 2271, 2287; perceptio, quae significatur per `Jehovah dixit,' fuit ex Divino 
caelesti, cogitatio autem, quae significatur per `Jehovah locutus,' fuit ex Divino caelesti per Divinum spirituale; ideo est quasi repetitio in sensu litterae, nempe `quemadmodum dixit' et `quemadmodum 
locutus est': quid autem sit percipere ex Divino caelesti, et cogitare ex Divino caelesti per Divinum spirituale, non cadit in captum etiam illustratissimum per illa quae sunt lucis mundi; inde 
patet quomodo infinita reliqua possunt. Quod ex perceptione sit cogitatio, videatur n. 1919, 2515: apud hominem ita se habet: bonum est ex quo percipit, veram autem per quod cogitat; bonum est amoris 
et ejus affectionum, proinde est inde perceptio, verum autem est fidei, proinde est haec cogitationis; illud significatur in historicis Verbi per `dicere,' hoc autem per `loqui'; at cum solum `dicere' 
legitur, tunc quandoque significat percipere, quandoque cogitare, quia `dicere' involvit utrumque. </p>
