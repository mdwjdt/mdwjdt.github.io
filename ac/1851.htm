<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1851节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1851.</strong>“以后他们必带着许多财物出来”表解救，以及他们会拥有属天和属灵的良善。这从“出来”和“财物”的含义清楚可知：“出来”表示被解救，“财物”表示属天和属灵的良善，因为这就是那些忍受迫害、经受试探、压迫、苦难，或奴役（如本节和前一节所述）之人所得之物。雅各的子孙出埃及时的财物（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出11.2.htm">11:2</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.36.htm">12:36</a>），以及列族被逐出后他们在迦南地的财物也代表和表示这些良善。先知书的各处都有类似例子，那里提到了从敌人那里夺来的战利品，他们因这些战利品而富有。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1851.</strong> And after this happens, they will depart with a great deal of property, symbolizes deliverance, and acquisition of heavenly and spiritual benefits. This can be seen from the symbolism of departing as being freed and from that of property as heavenly and spiritual good. This is the property acquired by people who suffer persecution and undergo trials, oppression, and affliction (slavery), as described in this verse and the last. Benefits of the same kind are also represented and symbolized by the property Jacob's descendants had when they left Egypt (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1851/bible_king-james-version_exodus_11_2" target=_top>Exodus 11:2</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1851/bible_king-james-version_exodus_12_36" target=_top>12:36</a>). The same is true of the property Jacob's descendants acquired in the land of Canaan, once they had driven off the indigenous nations [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1851/bible_king-james-version_joshua_11-12_16-6" target=_top>Joshua 11:16-12:6</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1851/bible_king-james-version_joshua_22_8" target=_top>22:8</a>], and it is true in passages throughout the prophets about taking plunder from one's enemies and growing rich on it.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} There are many passages in the prophets that mention plunder, and some that mention wealth as well (for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1851/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_8_4" target=_top>Isaiah 8:4</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1851/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_26_12" target=_top>Ezekiel 26:12</a>), but generally the idea of growing rich from plunder is only to be inferred from the context. For further discussion of the topic of plunder, or spoils, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1851/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6442" target=_top>6442</a>.

And after that shall they go out with great substance. That this signifies deliverance, and that they will have celestial and spiritual goods, is evident from the signification of "going out," which 
is to be liberated, and from the signification of "substance," which is celestial and spiritual goods, for this is the substance of those who suffer the persecutions, and undergo the temptations, oppressions, 
afflictions, or servitudes, that are treated of in this and the preceding verses. These goods are also represented and signified by the substance of the sons of Jacob when they went out of Egypt 
(Exod. 11:2; 12:36); and also by their substance in the land of Canaan when the nations had been driven out; and in the Prophets, whenever the spoils taken from their enemies are treated of, by which 
they were enriched. </p>

'And afterwards they will go out with great acquisitions' means release, and that they will possess celestial and spiritual goods. This is clear from the meaning of 'going out' as being released, and 
from the meaning of 'acquisitions' as celestial and spiritual good, for this is what those people acquire who suffer forms of persecution and undergo forms of temptation, oppression, and affliction or 
slavery, dealt with in this and the previous verse. Those goods were also represented and meant by the acquisitions of the sons of Jacob when they came out of Egypt, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2011:2;%2012:36&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 11:2; 12:36</a>, as well as by 
their acquisitions in the land of Canaan after the nations had been driven out. And similar examples occur in various places in the Prophets where reference is made to spoils taken from enemies, by which 
they were enriched. </p>

</p><b>1851.</b>
'Et postquam ita, exibunt acquisitione magna': quod significet liberationem, et quod illis bona caelestia et spiritualia, constat ex significatione 'exire' quod sit liberari, et a significatione 'acquisitionis' 
quod sit bonum caeleste et spirituale, nam haec acquisitio est illorum qui patiuntur persecutiones, et subeunt tentationes, oppressiones, afflictiones seu servitutem, de quibus in hoc et 
praecedente versu: haec bona quoque repraesentata et significata sunt per 'acquisitionem filiorum Jacobi, cum exiverunt Aegypto,' Exod. xi 2; xii 36, tum quoque per 'acquisitionem eorum in terra Canaane 
expulsis gentibus'; et passim apud Prophetas ubi de spoliis ab hostibus quibus ditescent, agitur. </p>
