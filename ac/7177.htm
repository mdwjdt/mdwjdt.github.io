<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7177节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7177.</strong>他们还被问及，从他们的星球上看，我们太阳系的太阳看上去是什么样。他们说，它很大，在那里比从其它星球看上去更大；他们又说，他们能根据其他灵人对太阳的观念知道这一点。他们进一步说，他们的气候适中，既不太热，也不太冷。然后，我蒙允许告诉他们，这是主的规定，以防止他们不会因其星球离太阳比其它星球更近而遭受过多的热量；因为热不是由于靠近太阳造成的，而是由于大气层的高度和密度造成的，这从高山即便在热带气候也很寒冷的事实明显可知。此外，热也照着太阳光线的入射角是直的还是倾斜的而各异，这从每个地区的冬夏两季明显可知。这些就是我蒙允许所知关于水星的灵人和居民的事。在下一章末尾，我会说一说金星灵。</p>

Being asked also about the sun of the world, how it appears from their earth, they said that it appears large, and that it appears larger there than from other earths: they said that they can know this 
from the idea of other spirits about the sun. They said further that they have a medium temperature, neither too hot nor too cold. I was then allowed to tell them that it has been so provided of the 
Lord in order that they may not be exposed to too much heat, by reason of their earth being nearer the sun than other earths; for heat does not come from nearness to the sun, but from the height and 
consequent density of the aerial atmosphere, as is evident from the cold on high mountains, even in hot climates. Moreover, heat varies according to the direct or oblique incidence of the sun's rays, 
as is evident from the seasons of winter and summer in every region.      These are the things that have been granted me to know about the spirits and inhabitants of the earth Mercury. At the end of 
the following chapter I will speak of the spirits of the planet Venus. </p>

They were also asked about the sun of our solar system, what it looked like from their planet. They said that it was large, and that it looked larger there than from other planets; they said that they 
were able to know this from other spirits' idea of the sun. They said in addition that their temperatures were moderate, being neither too hot nor too cold. I was then allowed to tell them that this 
was a provision made by the Lord, in order that they might not suffer from excessive heat because their planet was nearer to the sun than other planets are; for heat does not arise from nearness to the 
sun but from the depth and consequently the density of the layer of atmosphere, as is evident from the cold on high mountains, even on those in hot climates. Heat also varies according to whether the 
sun's rays fall directly or at an angle, as is evident from  winter and summer seasons in any region. These are the things that I have been allowed to know about the spirits and inhabitants of the 
planet Mercury. At the end of the next chapter something will be said about spirits belonging to the planet Venus. </p>

</p><b>7177.</b>
Interrogati etiam sunt de sole mundi qualiter ille ex tellure illorum apparet; dicebant quod magnus, et quod major ibi appareat quam ex aliis telluribus; dicebant se scire posse ex idea aliorum spirituum 
de sole.  Ulterius dicebant quod temperies illis esset media, nec calida nimis nec frigida; dicere illis tunc dabatur quod ita provisum sit a Domino ut non illis nimius calor, ex causa quod tellus 
illorum propinquior soli esset quam tellures aliae, quoniam calor non venit ex propinquitate ad solem sed ab atmosphaerae aereae altitudine et inde densitate, {1} ut patet a frigore super montibus 
altis, etiam qui in climatibus calidis sunt; tum quoque calor variatur secundum radiorum solis incidentiam rectam et obliquam, ut patet a temporibus hiemis et aestatis in unaquavis regione.  Haec sunt 
quae de spiritibus et incolis telluris Mercurii data sunt scire; ad finem capitis sequentis dicetur de spiritibus planetae Veneris. 	@1 i et$ </p>
