<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8370节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8370.</strong>“他们就在那里的水边安营”表试探过后，信之真理通过爱之良善被排列成序。这从“安营”和“水”的含义清楚可知：“安营”是指将真理和良善排列成序（<a href="8103.htm">8103</a>e，<a href="8130.htm">8130</a>，<a href="8131.htm">8131</a>，<a href="8155.htm">8155</a>节）；“水”是指信之真理（<a href="2702.htm">2702</a>，<a href="3058.htm">3058</a>，<a href="3424.htm">3424</a>，<a href="4976.htm">4976</a>，<a href="5668.htm">5668</a>节）。“在水边安营”之所以表示信之真理通过爱之良善被排列成序，是因为“营”表示真理和良善（<a href="8193.htm">8193</a>，<a href="8196.htm">8196</a>节）；“安营”表示将它们排列成序；“水”表示照着来自神的真理。之所以说“通过爱之良善”，是因为将真理排列成序是通过爱之良善实现的；因为真理在良善之下并照着良善排列自己，可以说照着它们所存在于其中的那个人的形像而与良善合为一体。之所以说照着“它们存在于其中的那个人的形像”，是因为一个人的灵之形像，也就是他的内在人，就是此人真正的自我；该形像完全照着通过与他同在的良善而对真理的有序整理和排列而塑成。这就是为何当天使出现时，爱之良善的气场就从他们身上涌出来，冲击在场之人的情感；信之真理从他们脸上闪耀出来。在灵界，这类事是显而易见的，也是能清楚感知到的。之所以说这种有序排列在试探之后发生，是因为良善和真理通过试探被植入人，但直到试探结束，它们才被排列成序。事实上，试探的状态是混乱的，而试探之后的状态是平静的；这种有序排列是在平静中进行的。因此，试探之后还伴随着由来自真理的启示所产生的一种愉悦感，以及由对良善的情感所产生的一种快乐感，如刚才所述（<a href="8367.htm">8367</a>节）。</p>

And they encamped there by the waters. That this signifies that after temptation the truths of faith were set in order by means of the good of love, is evident from the signification of "encamping," 
as being the setting in order of truth and good (n. 8103, 8130, 8131, 8155); and from the signification of "waters," as being truths of faith (n. 2702, 3058, 3424, 4976, 5668). That by the "encamping 
there by the waters" is signified that the truths of faith were set in order by means of the good of love, is because by a "camp" are signified truths and goods (n. 8193, 8196); and by "encamping" is 
signified the setting in order of them; and by "by the waters," is signified according to the truths which are from the Divine. It is said "by means of the good of love," because all setting in order 
of truths is effected by means of the good of love; for it is under and according to good that truths apply themselves, and make with good as it were one body. It is said "according to the image of the 
man in whom they are," because the image of a man's spirit-which is the man himself, for it is the inward man-is precisely according to the setting in order of the truths from good with him. Hence it 
is that when angels are made present, a sphere of the good of love pours out from them, and affects those who are present, and truths of faith shine forth from their faces. In the spiritual world such 
things appear, and are openly perceived. It is said that this setting in order is effected after temptation, because goods and truths are implanted in man by means of temptations, but are not set in 
order until afterward; for the state of temptation is turbulent, but the state after temptation is tranquil. The setting in order is effected in tranquility. On this account also temptations are followed 
by what is pleasant by reason of enlightenment from truth, and by what is delightful by reason of the affection of good (of which fact see just above, n. 8367). </p>

'And they encamped there beside the waters' means that after temptation the truths of faith were arranged into order by the good of love. This is clear from the meaning of 'encamping' as an arrangement 
of truth and good into order, dealt with in <a href="8103.htm">8103</a> (end), <a href="8130.htm">8130</a>, <a href="8131.htm">8131</a>, <a href="8155.htm">8155</a>; and from the meaning of 'the waters' as the truths of faith, dealt with in <a href="2702.htm">2702</a>, <a href="3058.htm">3058</a>, <a href="3424.htm">3424</a>, <a href="4976.htm">4976</a>, <a href="5668.htm">5668</a>. The reason why 'they 
encamped there beside the waters' means that the truths of faith were arranged into order by means of the good of love is that 'camp' means truths and forms of good, <a href="8193.htm">8193</a>, <a href="8196.htm">8196</a>, and 'encamping' an 
arrangement of them, while 'beside the waters' means in keeping with truths that come from God. The expression 'the good of love' is used because every arrangement of truths into order is effected through 
the good of love; for truths arrange themselves under good and accord with it, making with good one body so to speak in the image of the person in whom they exist. The expression 'in the image of 
the person in whom they exist' is used because the image of a person's spirit - which, being his internal man, is the person's true self - is fashioned altogether according to the ordering and arrangement 
of truths by good residing with him. This is why when angels come to be present the sphere of the good of love ripples out from them and impinges on the affections of those who are present; and 
the truths of faith shine from their faces. In the spiritual world these kinds of things are apparent and clearly perceived. The arranging into order is said to take place after temptation because although 
forms of good and truths are instilled into a person through temptations they are not arranged into order until the temptations have finished. For a state of temptation is one of turmoil, whereas 
the state after temptation is peaceful; and when there is peace the arranging into order takes place. Therefore temptations are also followed by a feeling of pleasure as a result of enlightenment from 
truth and by a feeling of delight as a result of an affection for good, dealt with just above in <a href="8367.htm">8367</a>. </p>

`Et castrametati sunt ibi juxta aquas': quod significet quod post tentationem ordinata vera fidei per bonum amoris, constat ex significatione `castrametari' quod sit ordinatio veri et boni, de qua n. 
8103 fin., 8130, 8131, 8155; et ex significatione `aquarum' quod sint vera fidei, de qua n. 2702, 3058, (x)3424, 4976, 5668; quod per `castrametati ibi juxta aquas' significetur quod ordinata sint vera 
fidei per bonum amoris, est quia per `castra' significantur vera et bona, n. 8193, 8196, et per `castrametari' ordinatio illorum, et per `juxta aquas' secundum vera quae a Divino; per bonum amoris 
dicitur, quia omnis ordinatio verorum fit per bonum amoris, est enim bonum sub quo {1}et secundum quod vera {2}se applicant, et faciunt cum bono sicut unum corpus ad imaginem hominis in quo sunt; ad 
imaginem hominis in quo sunt dicitur, quia imago spiritus hominis, qui est ipse homo, nam est internus homo, est prorsus secundum ordinationem verorum a bono apud illum; inde est, cum angeli sistuntur 
praesentes, quod sphaera boni amoris ex illis exundet et afficiat praesentes, et vera fidei elucescant ex faciebus illorum; in spirituali {3} mundo talia apparent et percipiuntur manifeste.  {4}Dicitur 
quod ordinatio illa fiat post tentationem, quoniam bona et vera implantantur homini per tentationes sed non ordinantur quam postea; status enim tentationis est turbulentus, at status post tentationem 
est tranquillus; in tranquillo fit ordinatio; idcirco etiam post tentationes succedit amoenum ex illustratione a vero, et jucundum ex affectione boni, de qua re mox supra n. (x)8367. 	@1 tum$ 	@2
