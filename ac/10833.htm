<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10833节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>星空中的第六颗星球-续<br /><strong>10833</strong>.后来，我问这些灵人关于他们所来自的星球上的各种事。我先问的是他们对神的敬拜。对此，他们回答说，每三十天各宗族及其家族聚在一个地方听讲道。这时，讲道者从稍稍高出地面的一个讲台教导他们来自神的真理，这些真理都通向生活的良善。当被问及他们是从哪里获得神之真理的知识时，他们说，这知识来自启示。关于启示，他们说，启示是在清晨半睡半醒的状态下发生的；那时，他们处于尚未被肉体感官和世俗事物所扰乱的内在之光；他们听见天上的天使谈论神的真理和符合它们的生活。当他们完全醒来时，一位身穿白衣的天使向他们显现，就在他们床边，然后突然从他们眼前消失。他们由此知道他们所听到的话来自天堂。这就是区分来自神的异象和非来自神的异象的方式，因为当异象并非来自神时，没有天使显现。他们补充说，这就是向他们的讲道人，有时也向其他人作出启示的方式。</p>

CONTINUATION ABOUT THE SIXTH EARTH IN THE STARRY HEAVEN. I afterward questioned those spirits about various things in the earth from which they were; and first about their Divine worship. To this they 
replied that the nations together with their families assemble every thirtieth day at one place, and hear preachings, and that from a pulpit raised somewhat above the ground the preacher then teaches 
them truths Divine which lead to the good of life. They were asked from what source they have a knowledge of truths Divine. They said that it is from revelation; and with regard to revelation they 
stated that it takes place in the morning, in a state midway between sleep and waking, when they are in interior light not yet interrupted by the senses of the body, and by worldly things; and that they 
then hear angels of heaven speaking about truths Divine and a life according to them; and that when they become awake an angel appears to them at the bedside in a white garment, who then suddenly disappears 
from their eyes, and from this they know that the things which they have heard are from heaven. In this way a vision of Divine origin is distinguished from a vision that is not Divine; for no 
angel appears in a vision that is not Divine. They added that revelations are made to their preachers, and sometimes also to others, in a similar way. </p>

THE SIXTH PLANET OUT IN SPACE - continued  </p>
<p>Afterwards I asked those spirits about various things on the planet from which they came. First I asked about their worship of God. To this they replied 
that every thirtieth day the clans and their families gather together in one particular place, where they hear sermons. The preacher then, speaking from a platform raised somewhat above the ground, 
teaches them truths from God which lead to goodness of life. When asked where their knowledge of God's truths came from, they said, From revelation. And of revelation they said that it takes place in 
the morning, in the half-way state between sleep and wakefulness, when they are in an inner light into which no sensation in their physical body nor any perception of worldly objects has as yet intruded, 
and when they hear the angels of heaven talking about God's truths and about a life in accord with them. And when they become fully awake there appears to them at their bed an angel in a white robe, 
who then suddenly disappears from their eyes. From this they know that the things they have heard come from heaven. This is how a vision from God is distinguished from a vision that does not come from 
God, for no angel appears when the vision does not come from God. They added that this is the manner in which revelations are made to their preachers, and sometimes also to others.  </p>

Continuatio de Sexta Tellure in Caelo Astrifero </p>
<p>Postea interrogabam spiritus illos de variis quae in tellure e qua erant, primum de cultu eorum Divino, ad quae respondebant quod gentes cum familiis 
suis quovis tricesimo die ad unum locum conveniant, et audiant praedicationes, et quod praedicator tunc e pulpito aliquantum a terra elevato doceat illos vera Divina quae ducunt (x)ad bonum vitae. 
 Quaerebatur unde nam sciunt vera Divina; dicebant quod ex revelatione; de revelatione aiebant quod fiat tempore matutino in statu medio inter somnum et vigiliam, quando in luce interiore nondum interpolata 
a sensibus corporis et a mundanis sunt, et quod tunc audiant angelos caeli loquentes de veris Divinis, ac de vita secundum illa; et quod cum in vigiliam veniunt, appareat illis angelus in veste 
alba ad lectum, qui tunc subito ab oculis illorum disparatur; et quod inde sciant quod ex caelo sint quae audiverunt; ita internoscitur visio Divina a visione non Divina, nam in visione non Divina angelus 
non apparet.  Addebant quod tali modo revelationes fiant apud praedicatores eorum, quandoque etiam apud alios. </p>
