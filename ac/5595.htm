<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5595节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5595.</strong>“以色列说”表从属灵良善所得的觉知。这从“说”的含义和“以色列”的代表清楚可知：“说”是指察觉，如前所述；“以色列”是指属灵良善（参看<a href="3654.htm">3654</a>，<a href="4598.htm">4598</a>节）。以色列因是属灵良善，故也是内在的属灵教会（<a href="3305.htm">3305</a>，<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>节）；因为这个教会能成为一个教会凭的是它的属灵良善。属灵良善是已变成良善的真理；因为当人照真理生活时，这真理就变成了良善。当他如此行时，真理便进入他的意愿，从意愿进入行为，成为他生活的一部分；当真理变成生活的一部分时，它就不再被称为真理，乃要称为良善。但将真理转变为良善的意愿是在人心智的理解力部分中所形成的新意愿；这良善被称为属灵良善。属灵良善不同于属天良善，因为属天良善被植入人心智的意愿部分本身；我们在前面经常论述这个主题。<br />雅各现在不像在前一章（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创42.36.htm">42:36</a>）那样叫“雅各”，而是改叫“以色列”；这是因为本章论述的主题是良善，而前一章论述的主题是真理。因此，在前一章，流便是说话的那一个，他代表教会教义的真理（参看<a href="3861.htm">3861</a>，<a href="3866.htm">3866</a>，<a href="4731.htm">4731</a>，<a href="4734.htm">4734</a>，<a href="4761.htm">4761</a>，<a href="5542.htm">5542</a>节）；而在本章，说话的是犹大，他代表教会的良善（<a href="3654.htm">3654</a>，<a href="5583.htm">5583</a>节）。现在之所以论述良善，是因为这次内在，即“约瑟”和外在，即雅各的十个儿子之间的结合通过居间层，即“便雅悯”实现。内在与外在的结合通过良善实现。</p>

And Israel said. That this signifies perception from spiritual good, is evident from the signification of "saying," as being to perceive (of which above); and from the representation of Israel, as being 
spiritual good (see n. 3654, 4598); and because Israel is spiritual good, he is also the internal spiritual church (n. 3305, 4286), for this church is a church from spiritual good. Spiritual good 
is truth that has become good; for truth becomes good when the man lives according to it, for it then passes into the will, and from the will into act, and becomes of the life; and when it becomes of 
the life it is no longer called truth but good. But the will which transforms truth into good is the new will in the intellectual part; it is this good that is called spiritual good. Spiritual good is 
distinguished from celestial good in that celestial good is implanted in man's will part itself; but this subject has often been treated of before. [2] That Jacob is not now called "Jacob," as in the 
previous chapter (Genesis 42:36), but "Israel," is because good is the subject treated of in this chapter, and truth in the preceding; wherefore in that chapter Reuben was the one to speak, by whom 
is represented the truth of doctrine of the church (see n. 3861, 3866, 4731, 4734, 4761, 5542), while in this chapter it is Judah who speaks, by whom is represented the good of the church (n. 3654, 5583). 
That good is now treated of is because this time the conjunction between the internal, which is Joseph, and the external, which is the ten sons of Jacob, is effected by means of the intermediate 
which is Benjamin; and the conjunction of the internal with the external is effected by means of good. </p>

'And Israel said' means a perception received from spiritual good. This is clear from the meaning of 'saying' as perceiving, dealt with already; and from the representation of 'Israel' as spiritual good, 
dealt with in <a href="3654.htm">3654</a>, <a href="4598.htm">4598</a>. And as 'Israel' represents spiritual good, he also represents the internal Church, <a href="3305.htm">3305</a>, <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>; for that Church is a Church by virtue of its spiritual good. Spiritual good 
is truth made into good; for truth is made into good when a person leads a life in keeping with that truth. When he does this, truth passes into his will and from there into action and becomes part 
of his life; and when truth becomes part of his life it is no longer called truth but good. But the will which transforms truth into good is the new will formed in the understanding part of his mind; 
and that good is called spiritual good. Spiritual good differs from celestial good in that celestial good is implanted in the will part of a person's mind. But this matter has been dealt with quite a 
number of times before. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why Jacob is not called Jacob now, as he is in verse 36 of the previous chapter, but Israel is that good is the subject here, whereas truth was the subject in 
the previous chapter. In the previous chapter the speaker was therefore Reuben, who represents the truth of doctrine taught by the Church, <a href="3861.htm">3861</a>, <a href="3866.htm">3866</a>, <a href="4731.htm">4731</a>, <a href="4734.htm">4734</a>, <a href="4761.htm">4761</a>, <a href="5542.htm">5542</a>; but in the present chapter 
the speaker is Judah, by whom the good of the Church is represented, <a href="3654.htm">3654</a>, <a href="5583.htm">5583</a>. Good becomes the subject now because this time the joining together is effected of the internal, which is 'Joseph', 
and the external, which is 'the ten sons of Jacob', through the intermediary, which is 'Benjamin'. That joining of the internal to the external is effected through good. </p>

`Et dixit Israel': quod significet perceptionem ex bono spirituali, constat (c)a significatione `dicere' quod sit percipere, de qua prius; et a repraesentatione `Israelis' quod sit bonum spirituale, 
de qua n. 3654, 4598, et quia `Israel' est bonum spirituale, est quoque Ecclesia spiritualis interna, n. 3305, 4286, nam Ecclesia illa est Ecclesia ex bono spirituali. Bonum spirituale est verum quod 
factum bonum; verum enim fit bonum cum vivitur secundum illud, tunc enim transit in voluntatem et a voluntate in actum, et fit vitae, et cum verum fit vitae, non amplius dicitur verum sed bonum; at voluntas 
quae transformat verum in bonum, est nova voluntas in parte intellectuali; id bonum est quod vocatur bonum spirituale; {1}bonum spirituale distinguitur a bono caelesti in eo quod {2}bonum caeleste 
implantatum sit {3} in ipsa parte voluntaria hominis; at de hac re saepius prius actum est. [2]Quod nunc Jacob non dicatur Jacob ut in priore capite, vers. 36, sed Israel, est quia {4}hic agitur 
de bono, at in capite praeced. de vero; quapropter in praecedente capite locutus est Reuben, per quem repraesentatur verum doctrinae Ecclesiae, n.  3861, 3866, 4731, 4734, 4761, 5542, in hoc autem capite 
loquitur Jehudah, per quem repraesentatur bonum Ecclesiae, n. 3654, 5583; quod de bono nunc agatur, est quia hac vice conjunctio fit interni quod `Josephus', cum externo quod `decem filii Jacobi', 
per medium quod `Benjamin', et conjunctio interni cum externo fit per bonum. @1 et$ @2 hoc bonum$ @3 i non in parte intellectuali sed$ @4 nunc$ </p>
