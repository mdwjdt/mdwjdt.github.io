<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4767.</strong>创世记37:31-35.他们拿了约瑟的外衣，从母山羊当中宰了一只公山羊，把那外衣蘸在血里；然后打发人把彩衣送走，人就把它带到他们父亲那里，说，我们找到这个，请认一认，是你儿子的外衣不是？他认得，就说，这是我儿子的外衣，有邪恶的野兽把他吞了，约瑟一定被撕碎了！雅各便撕裂衣服，腰间围上麻布，为他儿子悲哀了多日。他的众子和众女都起来安慰他，他却不肯受安慰，说，我必悲哀着下坟墓到我儿子那里。约瑟的父亲就为他哀哭。<br />“他们拿了约瑟的外衣”表表象。“从母山羊当中宰了一只公山羊”表从快乐所得来的外在真理。“把那外衣蘸在血里”表他们用邪恶所产生的虚假玷污这些表象。“然后打发人把彩衣送走”表以这种方式被玷污的表象。“人就把它带到他们父亲那里”表与古教会和初代（基督）教会的良善和真理相比。“说，我们找到这个”表它在他们看来就是这样子。“请认一认，是你儿子的外衣不是”表是否有任何相似之处。“他认得”表的确有相似之处。“就说，这是我儿子的外衣”表它就是教会所拥有的真理。“有邪恶的野兽把他吞了”表恶欲毁灭了它。“约瑟一定被撕碎了”表虚假使得真理完全不存在。“雅各便撕裂衣服”表为被毁或丧失的真理而哀恸。“腰间围上麻布”表为被毁或丧失的良善而哀恸。“为他儿子悲哀了多日”表状态。“他的众子”表那些陷入虚假的人。“和众女都起来”表那些陷入邪恶的人。“安慰他”表基于圣言字义来解释。“他却不肯受安慰”表这是不可能的。“说，我必悲哀着下坟墓到我儿子那里”表古教会将要灭亡。“约瑟的父亲就为他哀哭”表内在的哀恸。</p>

Verses 31-35. And they took Joseph's tunic, and killed a he-goat of the goats, and dipped the tunic in the blood; and they sent the tunic of various colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, 
This have we found; know now whether it be thy son's tunic or not. And he knew it, and said, It is my son's tunic; an evil wild beast hath devoured him; Joseph is surely torn in pieces. And Jacob 
rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned over his son many days. And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to comfort himself and he said, 
For I shall go down to the grave to my son mourning. And his father wept for him. "And they took Joseph's tunic," signifies appearances; "and killed a he-goat of the goats" signifies external truths from 
delights; "and dipped the tunic in the blood," signifies that they defiled it with falsities from evils; "and they sent the tunic of various colors" signifies appearances thus defiled; "and they brought 
it to their father," signifies comparison with the goods and truths of the Ancient and the Primitive Church; "and said, "This have we found," signifies that it so appears to them; "know I pray 
whether it be thy son's tunic or not," signifies whether there was a likeness; "and he knew it," signifies that indeed it was; "and said, It is my son's tunic," signifies that it was the truth of the 
church; "an evil wild beast hath devoured him," signifies that the cupidities of evil had extinguished it; "Joseph is surely torn in pieces," signifies that it is such from falsities as to be not at all; 
"and Jacob rent his garments," signifies mourning for truth destroyed; "and put sackcloth upon his loins," signifies mourning for goods destroyed; "and mourned over his son many days," signifies the 
state; "and all his sons," signifies those who are in falsities; "and all his daughters, rose up," signifies those who are in evils; "to comfort him," signifies to interpret from the sense of the letter 
of the Word; "and he refused to comfort himself," signifies that this could not be; "and he said, For I shall go down to the grave to my son mourning," signifies that the Ancient Church would perish; 
"and his father wept for him," signifies interior mourning. </p>

Verses 31-35 And they took Joseph's tunic and killed a he-goat of the she-goats, and dipped the tunic in the blood. And they sent the tunic of various colours, and brought it to their father, and said, 
We have found this; recognize now whether this is your son's tunic or not. And he recognized it, and said, My son's tunic! An evil wild animal has devoured him; Joseph has been torn to pieces. And 
Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned over his son many days. And all his sons rose up, and all his daughters, to comfort him; and he refused to comfort himself, and said, 
For I will go down to my son, to the grave mourning. And his father wept for him. </p>
<p>'They took Joseph's tunic' means appearances. 'And killed a he-goat of the she- goats' means external truths received 
from delights. 'And dipped the tunic in the blood' means that they defiled those appearances with falsities arising from evils. 'And they sent the tunic of various colours' means the appearances 
that have been defiled in this way. 'And brought it to their father' means comparison with the goods and truths of the Ancient Church and of the Primitive [Christian] one. 'And said, We have found this' 
means that this is what they see it to be. 'Recognize now whether this is your son's tunic or not' means whether there was any likeness. 'And he recognized it' means, yes, there was. 'And said, My 
son's tunic!' means that it was the truth possessed by the Church. 'An evil wild animal has devoured him' means that desires for evil annihilated it. 'Joseph has been torn to pieces' means that falsities 
render that truth entirely non-existent. 'And [Jacob] rent his clothes' means mourning for lost truth. 'And put sackcloth on his loins' means mourning for lost good. 'And mourned over his son many 
days' means a state. 'And all his sons rose up' means those who are governed by falsities. 'And all his daughters' means those who are governed by evils. 'To comfort him' means to provide explanations 
based on the sense of the letter of the Word. 'And he refused to comfort himself' means that this was not possible. 'For I will go down to my son, to the grave mourning' means that the Ancient Church 
was perishing. 'And his father wept for him' means interior mourning. </p>

Vers. 31-35.  Et sumpserunt tunicam Josephi, et mactarunt hircum caprarum, et intinxerunt tunicam in sanguine. Et miserunt tunicam variorum colorum, et adduxerunt ad patrem illorum, et dixerunt, 
Hanc invenimus, agnosce quaeso an tunica filii tui haec, si non.  Et agnovit illam, et dixit, Tunica filii mei, fera mala comedit eum, discerpendo discerptus est Joseph.  Et discidit Jacob vestes suas, 
et posuit saccum in lumbis suis, et luxit super filio suo diebus multis.  Et surrexerunt omnes filii ejus, et omnes filiae ejus, ad consolandum eum, et renuit ad consolandum se, et dixit, Quia 
descendam ad filium meum lugens sepulcrum; et flevit eum pater ejus.  `Sumpserunt tunicam Josephi' significat apparentias: `et mactarunt hircum caprarum significat vera externa ex jucundis: `et intinxerunt 
tunicam in sanguine' significat quod foedaverint falsis ex malis: `et miserunt tunicam variorum colorum' significat ita apparentias foedatas: `et adduxerunt ad patrem illorum' significat 
collationem cum bonis et veris Ecclesiae Antiquae et Primitivae: `et dixerunt, Hanc invenimus' significat quod illis ita appareat: `agnosce quaeso an tunica filii tui haec, si non' significat num similitudo: 
`et agnovit illam' significat quod quidem esset: `et dixit, Tunica filii mei' significat quod verum Ecclesiae: `fera mala comedit eum' significat quod cupiditates mali exstinxerint: `discerpendo 
discerptus est Joseph' significat quod a falsis talis ut prorsus non sit: `et discidit Jacob vestes suas' significat luctum pro deperdito vero: `et posuit saccum in lumbis suis' significat 
luctum pro deperdito bono: `et luxit super filio suo diebus multis' significat statum: `et surrexerunt omnes filii ejus' significat illos qui in falsis: `et omnes filiae ejus' significat illos qui 
in malis: `ad consolandum eum' significat ut interpretarentur ex sensu litterae Verbi: `et renuit ad consolandum se' significat quod non posset: `quia descendam ad filium meum lugens sepulcrum' significat 
quod Ecclesia Antiqua perierit: `et flevit eum pater ejus' significat luctum interiorem. </p>
