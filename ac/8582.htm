<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8582节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8582.</strong>“你要击打磐石”表他们要急切地求问祂。这从“击打”的含义清楚可知，“击打”是指急切地求问，不过是出于一颗谦卑的心。“击打磐石”表示出于一颗谦卑的心急切地求问，这一点从以下事实可以看出来：由于摩西出于一颗硬心击打磐石，以这种方式要水，所以经上向他声称，他必不得领这百姓进迦南地，正如他自己在民数记中所记载的：<br />摩西、亚伦就招聚会众到磐石前，摩西对他们说，你们这些背叛的人听我说，我们要为你们使水从这磐石中流出来吗？摩西举手，用杖击打磐石两下，就有许多水流出来。耶和华对摩西、亚伦说，因为你们不信我，不在以色列人眼前尊我为圣，所以你们必不得领这会众进我所赐给他们的地去。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民20.10.htm">20:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民20.12.htm">12</a>）</p>

And thou shalt smite the rock. That this signifies that they should be urgent in entreating the Lord, is evident from the signification of "smiting," as being to be urgent in entreating, but from a humble 
heart. That "to smite the rock" denotes to entreat urgently from a humble heart, can be seen from the fact that because Moses smote the rock from a hard heart, and in this way expostulated, therefore 
it was intimated to him that he should not bring the people into the land of Canaan, as he himself relates in the book of Numbers: </p>
<p>     Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before 
the rock, and he said to them, Hear I pray ye rebels; shall we bring you forth waters out of this rock? and Moses lifted up his hand, and smote the rock with his rod twice. Nevertheless many waters came 
out. Then Jehovah said unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye have not believed in Me, and sanctified Me in the eyes of the sons of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which 
I have given them (Num. 20:10-12). </p>

'And you are to strike the rock' means that they are to ask Him - the Lord - insistently. This is clear from the meaning of 'striking' as asking insistently, but in humility of heart. That 'striking 
the rock' means asking insistently, in humility of heart, may be recognized from the incident in which, because Moses struck the rock in hardness of heart, that is, he demanded water, it was declared 
to him that he would not lead the people into the land of Canaan, as he himself records in the Book of Numbers, </p>
<blockquote>
Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock; and he said to them, 
Hear now, you rebels; must we bring water for you out of this rock? And Moses raised his hand and struck the rock twice with his rod. Nonetheless much water came out Then Jehovah said to Moses and 
Aaron, Because you did not believe in Me and honour Me as holy in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore you will not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2020:10-12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 20:10-12</a>.

</p><b>8582.</b>
`Et percutias petram': quod significet ut instent rogare Ipsum, nempe Dominum, constat ex significatione `percutere' quod sit instare rogando, sed ex humili corde; quod `percutere' petram sit instanter 
rogare {1} ex humili corde, constare potest ex eo quod, quia Moscheh percussit petram ex duro corde, et sic expostulavit, ideo ei denuntiatum sit ut non introduceret populum in terram Canaanem, sicut 
ipse memorat in Libro Numerorum, Congregaverunt Moscheh et Aharon congregationem ante petram; et dixit illis, Audite, quaeso, rebelles, num ex petra hac educemus vobis aquas? et sustulit Moscheh 
manum suam, et percussit petram baculo suo duabus vicibus; nihilominus exiverunt aquae multae; tunc dixit Jehovah ad Moschen et Aharonem, Propterea quod non credidistis in Me, et sanctificaveritis Me 
in oculis filiorum Israelis, ideo non deducetis congregationem hanc in terram quam dedi illis, xx 10-12. 	@1 i et$ </p>
