<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2686节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2686.</strong>“箭”在此表真理的教义。这从它的含义清楚可知。在圣言中，凡论述战争，以及提及战争的地方，所表示的都是属灵的战争，而非其它战争（<a href="1664.htm">1664</a>节）。古教会也有一些被冠名为“耶和华战记”，这一点明显可见于摩西书（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.14.htm">21:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.16.htm">16</a>）。这些书以预言的风格写就，具有内义，论述了主的争战和试探，以及教会和教会成员的争战和试探。这一点从摩西从这些书中选取了一些事的事实，以及该教会名为《预言集》（The Books of the Prophetic Enunciators）的其它书（对此，参看民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.27.htm">21:27</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.30.htm">30</a>）明显看出来，那里出现了的话几乎和耶利米书中的一样（对照民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.28.htm">21:28</a>和耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶48.45.htm">48:45</a>）。由此可得出以下结论：古教会拥有着述，既有历史着述，也有预言着述，它们都是神性，是被启示的，就内义而言论述了主及其国度；并且对这些人来说，这些着述就是圣言，如同历史书和预言书对我们来说也是圣言一样。就字义而言，这些书论述了犹太人和以色列人，但就内义而言，则论述了主，以及主的事。<br />由于在圣言，以及古教会的书中，“战争”表示属灵的战争，故所有武器，如剑、枪、盾、矛、标枪、弓和箭等，都特指诸如属于灵义上所理解的战争之类的事物。至于具体的武器种类特指什么，蒙主怜悯，我将在别处予以阐述。现在此说明“箭”的含义，即它表示真理的教义，以及该含义如何从标枪、箭，或其它投掷物中衍生出来的。这些武器均表示教义，那些属灵之人尤其通过并利用教义进行战斗，因此在过去，他们被称为“弓箭手”。<br />“箭”表真理的教义，这一点从以下经文明显看出来。以赛亚书：<br />耶和华的箭锐利，祂的弓全都上了弦；祂的马蹄算如火石，祂的车轮好像旋风。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.28.htm">5:28</a>）<br />此处论述的是教义的真理；“箭”是指属灵的真理；“弓”是指教义；“马蹄”是指属世的真理；“车轮”是指其教义；由于这些事物具有这样的含义，故它们被归给耶和华。若非具有灵义，它们不可能被归给耶和华。若非具有灵义，它们无非是些不恰当的空洞词语。耶利米哀歌：<br />主张弓，好像仇敌；他站着举起右手如同敌人，将悦人眼目的尽行杀戮。在锡安女子的帐棚上，倒出祂的忿怒像火一样。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.4.htm">2:4</a>）<br />此处“弓”表真理的教义，在那些沉浸于虚假的人看来，它如同仇敌和敌意。论及主的弓不可能是其它种类的。哈巴谷书：<br />耶和华啊，你乘在马上，你的战车就是救恩，你的弓全然显露。（哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈3.8.htm">3:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈3.9.htm">9</a>）<br />此处“弓”也表良善与真理的教义。摩西书：<br />弓箭手激怒他，向他射箭，仇恨他。但他的弓仍旧坚硬；他的手臂强健敏捷，这是因着雅各之大能者的手；以色列的牧者、以色列的石头是从那里而出的。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.23.htm">49:23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.24.htm">24</a>）<br />这论及约瑟，“弓”表良善与真理的教义。<br />启示录：<br />我就观看，见有一匹白马；骑在马上的执有弓，并有冠冕赐给他。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.2.htm">6:2</a>）<br />“白马”表智慧；“骑在马上的”表圣言，这在启示录19:13说得更清楚，那里再次论述了白马；“骑在马上的”是指圣言，故显而易见，“弓”表真理的教义。以赛亚书：<br />谁从东方兴起义人，召他来到脚前呢？祂将列族交在他面前，使他管辖君王；把他们如灰尘交与他的刀，如风吹的碎秸交与他的弓。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛41.2.htm">41:2</a>）<br />此处论述的是主；“刀”表真理；“弓”表源于祂的教义。同一先知书：<br />我要作记号在他们中间，逃脱的我要差到列族去，就是到他施、普勒、拉弓的路德和土巴、雅完。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛66.19.htm">66:19</a>）<br />“拉弓的”表那些教导教义的人。“他施”的含义可参看前文（<a href="1156.htm">1156</a>节）；“路德”的含义（参看<a href="1195.htm">1195</a>，<a href="1231.htm">1231</a>节）；“土巴”的含义（参看<a href="1151.htm">1151</a>节）；“雅完”的含义（参看<a href="1152.htm">1152</a>-<a href="1153.htm">1153</a>，<a href="1155.htm">1155</a>节）。<br />耶利米书：<br />全城的人因马兵和弓箭手的响声就都逃跑，进入密林，爬上磐石；全城都被撇下。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.29.htm">4:29</a>）<br />“马兵”表那些宣讲真理的人，“弓”表真理的教义，沉浸于虚假的人因它而逃跑或害怕。同一先知书：<br />你们要在巴比伦的四围摆阵；所有拉弓的啊，射箭攻击她，不要顾惜箭枝，因她犯罪得罪了耶和华。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.14.htm">50:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.29.htm">29</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.2.htm">51:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.3.htm">3</a>）<br />此处那些“拉弓射箭”的人表那些宣讲和教导真理的教义之人。<br />撒迦利亚书：<br />我必除灭以法莲的战车和耶路撒冷的战马，争战的弓也必除灭。他必向列族讲和平。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚9.10.htm">9:10</a>）<br />“以法莲”表教会对真理的理解，“弓”表教义。撒母耳记：<br />大卫作哀歌，吊扫罗和他儿子约拿单，且吩咐要教导犹大人开弓。（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下1.17.htm">1:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下1.18.htm">18</a>）<br />此处论述的主题不是“弓”，而是信的教义。以西结书：<br />主耶和华说，这乃是我所说的日子。住以色列城邑的人必出去点火烧军械，就是大盾小牌、弓和箭、梃杖、枪矛，用它们来烧火，直烧七年。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结39.8.htm">39:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结39.9.htm">9</a>）<br />此处所提及的军械全都是用于属灵战争的武器；“弓和箭”表教义及其真理。在来世，真理本身脱离良善显于眼见时，就看似箭。<br />“弓”因表真理的教义，故在反面意义上表虚假的教义。在圣言中，诸如此类的事物普遍具有反面意义，如经上数处所阐述和说明的。耶利米书：<br />看哪！有一种民从北国而来，并有一大民族被激动，从地极来到。他们拿弓和枪，性情残忍，不施怜悯。他们的声音，像海浪咆哮。锡安女子啊，他们骑马，都摆队伍，如上战场的人要攻击你。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶6.22.htm">6:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶6.23.htm">23</a>）<br />此处“弓”表虚假的教义。同一先知书：<br />看哪！有一种民从北方而来，并有一大民族和许多君王被激动，从地极来到。他们拿弓和枪，性情残忍，不施怜悯。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.41.htm">50:41</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.42.htm">42</a>）<br />此处意思也一样。同一先知书：<br />他们弯起舌头；他们的弓是谎话，不是为真理。他们在地上增长势力；因为他们恶上加恶，并不认识我。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶9.3.htm">9:3</a>）<br />显然，“弓”是指虚假的教义，因为经上说“他们弯起舌头；他们的弓是谎话，不是为真理”。<br />万军之耶和华如此说，看哪，我必折断以拦人的弓，就是他为首的权力。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.35.htm">49:35</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />来吧，看耶和华的作为，祂使地荒凉；止息战争，直到地极；祂折弓、断枪，把战车焚烧在火中。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗46.8.htm">46:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗46.9.htm">9</a>）.<br />在犹大，神为人所认识；在以色列，祂的名为大。在撒冷，有祂的帐幕，在锡安，有祂的居所。祂在那里折断弓上的火箭，并盾牌、刀剑和战器。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗76.1.htm">76:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗76.3.htm">3</a>）<br /><br />看哪，恶人弯弓，把箭搭在弦上，要在暗中射那心里正直的人。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗11.2.htm">11:2</a>）<br />此处“弓和箭”明显表虚假的教义。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2686</b></p><p><b>2686.</b>
That a "bow" here denotes the doctrine of truth, is evident from its signification. Wherever wars are treated of in the Word, and wherever they are mentioned, no other wars are signified than spiritual 
ones (n. 1664). There were books also in the Ancient Word that were entitled "The Wars of Jehovah;" as is evident in Moses (Num. 21:14-16); which, being written in the prophetic style, had an internal 
sense, and treated of the combats and temptations of the Lord, and also of those of the church, and of the men of the church. This is manifest from the fact that some things were taken from these 
books by Moses; and also from other books of that church called "The Books of the Prophetic Enunciators" (respecting which see Num. 21:27-30), in which almost the same words are found as in Jeremiah (compare 
Num. 21:28, and Jer. 48:45). From this it may also be concluded that the Ancient Church had writings both historic and prophetic that were Divine and inspired, and that in their internal sense 
treated of the Lord and His kingdom; and that these were the Word to them, as are to us those historic and prophetic books which in the sense of the letter treat of the Jews and Israelites, but in their 
internal sense of the Lord, and of the things which are His.  [2] As in the Word, and also in the books of the Ancient Church, "war" signified spiritual war, so all arms, such as sword, spear, buckler, 
shield, darts, bow, and arrows, signified special things belonging to war as understood in the spiritual sense. What the several kinds of arms specifically signify, will of the Lord's Divine mercy 
be told elsewhere. Here it will now be shown what a "bow" signifies, namely, the doctrine of truth; and this from the darts, arrows, or other missiles, which denote the doctrinal things from which 
and with which those in especial fight who are spiritual, and who were thence formerly called "shooters with the bow." [3] That a "bow" signifies the doctrine of truth is evident from the following 
passages. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah's arrows are sharp, and all His bows are bent, the hoofs of His horses are counted as rock, and His wheels as the whirlwind (Isa. 5:28). Here the truths of doctrine 
are treated of; "arrows" are spiritual truths; "bows" are doctrine; the "horses' hoofs" are natural truths; the "wheels" are their doctrine; and as these things have such a signification they are attributed 
to Jehovah, to whom they cannot be attributed except in a spiritual sense; for otherwise they would be empty words and unbecoming. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     The Lord hath bent His bow like an enemy, 
He hath stood with His right hand as an adversary, and hath slain all that were pleasant to the eye in the tent of the daughter of Zion, He hath poured out His fury like fire (Lam. 2:4). Here "bow" denotes 
the doctrine of truth, which appears to those who are in falsities as an enemy and as hostile; no other bow can be predicated of the Lord. In Habakkuk: </p>
<p>     O Jehovah, Thou ridest upon Thy horses, 
Thy chariots of salvation, Thy bow will be made quite bare (Hab. 3:8-9). Here also the "bow" is the doctrine of good and truth. In Moses: </p>
<p>     They grieved him, and shot at him, the archers hated 
him, his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob; from thence is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel (Gen. 49:23-24); </p>
<p>where Joseph is 
spoken of. His "bow" denotes the doctrine of good and truth. [4] In John: </p>
<p>     I saw and behold a white horse, and he that sat thereon had a bow, and there was given unto him a crown (Rev. 6:2). The 
"white horse" denotes wisdom; "he that sat thereon," the Word, as is said plainly in chapter 19:13, where the white horse is again treated of; and as he that sat thereon was the Word, it is evident 
that the "bow" is the doctrine of truth. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Who hath raised up righteousness from the east, and called him to his footsteps? He hath given nations before him, and made him to rule over 
kings; he gave them as dust to his sword, as the driven stubble to his bow (Isa. 41:2); </p>
<p>where the Lord is treated of; the "sword" denotes truth; the "bow," doctrine from Him. In the same: </p>
<p>     I will 
set a sign among them, and I will send such as escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan (Isa. 66:19). They that "draw the bow" denote those 
who teach doctrine. The signification of "Tarshish" may be seen above (n. 1156); that of "Lud" (n. 1195, 1231), that of "Tubal" (n. 1151), and that of "Javan" (1152-1153, 1155). [5] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>  
   For the voice of the horseman and of him that shooteth the bow, the whole city fleeth; they have entered into clouds, and climbed up upon the rocks, the whole city is forsaken (Jer. 4:29). The "horseman" 
denotes those who declare truth; the "bow," the doctrine of truth, which they who are in falsities flee from or fear. In the same: </p>
<p>     Set yourselves in array against Babel round about; all 
ye that bend the bow shoot at her, spare not with the arrow, for she hath sinned against Jehovah (Jer. 50:14, 29; 51:2-3); </p>
<p>where "they that shoot, and bend the bow" denote those who declare and teach 
the doctrine of truth. [6] In Zechariah: </p>
<p>     I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem; and the battle bow shall be cut off, and He shall speak peace unto the nations (Zech. 
9:10). "Ephraim" denotes the understanding of truth in the church; the "bow," doctrine. In Samuel: </p>
<p>     David lamented with this lamentation over Saul, and over Jonathan his son, and he said it 
to teach the sons of Judah the bow (2 Sam. 1:17-18). where the "bow" is not the subject, but the doctrinal things of faith. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Said the Lord Jehovih, This is the day whereof I have spoken; 
and they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn up the weapons, the shield and the buckler, the bow and the arrows, and the hand staff and the spear, 
and they shall kindle fire in them seven years (Ezek. 39:8-9). The arms here named are all arms of spiritual war; the "bow with the arrows" denote doctrine and its truths. In the other life truths themselves, 
when separated from good and represented to the sight, appear like arrows. [7] As a "bow" signifies the doctrine of truth, in the opposite sense it signifies the doctrine of falsity. The same 
things in the Word have usually an opposite sense, as has been said and shown in several places; thus in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Behold a people cometh from the north country, and a great nation shall be stirred 
up from the sides of the earth; they lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and shall not have compassion; their voice shall roar like the sea, they shall ride upon horses set in array as a 
man for battle, against thee, O daughter of Zion (Jer. 6:22-23); </p>
<p>where "bow" denotes the doctrine of falsity. In the same: </p>
<p>     Behold a people cometh from the north, and a great nation, and many kings 
shall be stirred up from the sides of the earth, they lay hold on bow and spear, they are cruel, and have no compassion (Jer. 50:41-42); </p>
<p>where the meaning is similar. In the same: </p>
<p>     They bend 
their tongue; their bow is a lie, and not for truth, they are grown strong in the land; for they have gone forth from evil to evil, and have not known Me (Jer. 9:3). [8] That the "bow" is the doctrine 
of falsity is plainly manifest, for it is said, "they bend their tongue; their bow is a lie, and not for truth." In the same: </p>
<p>     Jehovah Zebaoth said, Behold I will break the bow of Elam, the chief 
of his might (Jer. 49:35). In David: </p>
<p>     Come, behold the works of Jehovah, who hath made desolations in the earth; He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth, He breaketh the bow, He cutteth 
the spear in sunder, He burneth the chariots in the fire (Ps. 46:9).      In Judah is God known, His name is great in Israel; in Salem also shall be His tabernacle, and His dwelling-place in Zion; 
there brake He the fiery shafts of the bow, the shield and the sword, and the war (Ps. 76:1-3). In the same: </p>
<p>     Lo the wicked bend the bow, they make ready their arrows upon the string, to shoot 
in darkness at the upright in heart (Ps. 11:2). Here the "bow and arrows" plainly denote doctrinal things of falsity. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2686</b></p><p><b>2686.</b>
That 'a bow' is the doctrine of faith is clear from its meaning. In the Word, wherever wars are the subject and wherever wars are mentioned, none but spiritual wars are meant in the internal sense, <a href="1664.htm">1664</a>. 
There were also in the Ancient Church books that were entitled The Wars of Jehovah, as is clear in Moses, in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2021:%2014-16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 21: 14-16</a>. These, which were written in the prophetical style, possessed an internal 
sense and had as their subject the Lord's conflicts and temptations, and also the Church's conflicts and temptations, and those of members of the Church. This is evident from the fact that some things 
were selected by Moses from those books, as well as from other books of that Church which were called The Books of the Utterers of Prophecies,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> referred to in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2021:%2027-30&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 21: 27-30</a>, where almost the same 
words occur as in Jeremiah; compare <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2021:%2028&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 21: 28</a> with <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2048:%2045&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 48: 45</a>. From this it may also be concluded that the Ancient Church had writings, historical and also prophetical, which were Divine and inspired 
and which in the internal sense had the Lord and His kingdom as their subject, and that for those people these writings were the Word as the historical and the prophetical books are for us, which 
in the sense of the letter have to do with the Jews and Israelites but in the internal sense with the Lord and with the things which are His. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As in the Word, and also in the books of the Ancient 
Church, 'war' meant spiritual warfare, so all weapons such as the sword, spear, buckler, shield, arrows, shafts, and bows meant such things specifically as belong to the warfare that is meant in the 
spiritual sense. What is meant specifically by particular kinds of weapons will in the Lord's Divine mercy be stated elsewhere. Here the meaning of 'the bow', namely the doctrine of truth, will be shown, 
and how this meaning is derived from arrows, shafts, or darts, which mean the things of doctrine from which and with which those in particular who are spiritual fight, who in former times were therefore 
called 'archers'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That 'the bow' means the doctrine of truth becomes clear from the following places: In Isaiah, </p>
<p>The arrows of Jehovah are sharp, and all His bows are bent. His horses' 
hoofs are considered as flint, and His wheels as the whirlwind. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%205:%2028&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 5: 28</a>. </p>
<p>This refers to the truths of doctrine. 'arrows' are spiritual truths, 'bows' doctrine, 'horses' hoofs' natural truths, 
'wheels' their doctrine. It is because such things are meant by them that those objects are attributed to Jehovah, to whom they cannot be attributed except in the spiritual sense, otherwise they would 
be words that are empty and not appropriate. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The Lord has bent His bow like an enemy, He has stood with His right hand like a foe, and has slain all things pleasant to the eye in the 
tent of the daughter of Zion, He has poured out His anger like fire. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lam%202:%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lam 2: 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Bow' stands for the doctrine of truth, which is seen by those immersed in falsities as a foe and hostile. No other 
kind of bow can be spoken of in reference to the Lord. In Habakkuk, </p>
<blockquote>
O Jehovah, You ride on Your horses, Your chariots are salvation, Your bow will be made quite bare. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hab%203:%208,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hab 3: 8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'bow' 
means the doctrine of good and truth. In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
The archers will exasperate him and shoot at him and hate him. He will sit in the strength of his bow, and the arms of his hands will be made strong 
by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob; from there is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2049:%2023,%2024&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 49: 23, 24</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Joseph, 'bow' standing for the doctrine of good and truth.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In John, </p>
<blockquote>
I 
saw, and behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it had a bow; to him a crown was given. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%206:%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 6: 2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'A white horse' stands for wisdom, 'he who sat on it' for the Word, as is made explicit 
in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2019:%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 19: 13</a>, where the white horse is referred to again. And because 'he who sat on it' is the Word it is clear that 'a bow' means the doctrine of truth. In Isaiah, </p>
<p>Who stirred up righteousness 
from the east, called him to be His follower, gave nations before Him, and caused Him to have dominion over kings? He made them as dust to His sword, as driven stubble to His bow. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2041:%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 41: 2</a>. </p>
<p>This 
refers to the Lord, 'sword' standing for truth, 'bow' for doctrine derived from Him. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
I will set a sign among them, and I will send survivors from them to the nations, to Tarshish, 
Pul, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2066:%2019&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 66: 19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Those who draw the bow' stands for teachers of doctrine. For what Tarshish means, see <a href="1156.htm">1156</a>; Lud, <a href="1195.htm">1195</a>, <a href="1231.htm">1231</a>; Tubal, <a href="1151.htm">1151</a>; Javan, <a href="1152.htm">1152</a>, <a href="1153.htm">1153</a>, <a href="1155.htm">1155</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Jeremiah, At the noise of the horseman and of him who wields the bow the whole city takes to flight. They have entered clouds and climbed up on rocks. The whole city has 
been forsaken. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%204:%2029&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 4: 29</a>. </p>
<p>'The horseman' stands for those who declare the truth, 'the bow' for the doctrine of truth, which they flee from or fear who are immersed in falsities. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Set 
yourselves in array against Babylon round about; O all you who bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrow, for she has sinned against Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2050:%2014,%2029;%2051:%202,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 50: 14, 29; 51: 2, 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'those who 
shoot and bend the bow' stands for declarers and teachers of the doctrine of truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow 
will be cut off, and He will speak peace to the nations. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%209:%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 9: 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Ephraim' stands for the Church's understanding of truth, 'bow' for doctrine. In Samuel, </p>
<blockquote>
David lamented with this lamentation 
over Saul and over Jonathan, his son, and told [them] to teach the children of Judah the bow. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2%20Sam%201:%2017,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">2 Sam 1: 17, 18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the bow' is not the subject but doctrinal matters regarding faith. In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
The 
Lord Jehovih has said, This is the day of which I have spoken, and those who dwell in the cities of Israel will go out, and they will make fires of and burn the weapons, both shield and buckler, 
bow and arrows, both hand-staff and spear; and they will make a fire of them for seven years. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2039:%208,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 39: 8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The weapons mentioned here are all weapons for spiritual war. 'Bow and arrows' stands 
for doctrine and its truths. Furthermore when truths themselves separated from goods are represented visually in the next life they are seen as arrows. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 Just as 'the bow' means the doctrine of 
truth, so in the contrary sense it means the doctrine of falsity. In the Word things like these nearly always have a contrary sense, as stated and shown in various places; as in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, 
a people coming from the land in the north, and a mighty nation will be stirred up from the furthest parts of the earth. They lay hold on bow and spear; it is cruel and they will have no pity. Their 
voice will roar like the sea, they will ride upon horses, every one set in array as a man for battle, against you, O daughter of Zion! <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%206:%2022,%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 6: 22, 23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'bow' stands for the doctrine of falsity. 
In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, a people coming from the north, a mighty nation, and many kings will be stirred up from the furthest parts of the earth. They have hold of bow and spear; they are cruel 
and have no pity. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2050:%2041,%2042&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 50: 41, 42</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the meaning is similar. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
They bend their tongue; their bow is a bow of lies and not used for truth. They grow strong in the land, for 
they have gone on from evil to evil and do not know Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%209:%202,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 9: 2, 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'A bow', it is quite evident, means the doctrine of falsity, for it is said that 'they bend their tongue, their bow is a bow 
of lies and not for truth'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah Zebaoth has said, Behold, I am breaking the bow of Elam, the chief of its might. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2049:%2035&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 49: 35</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Come, behold the works 
of Jehovah who makes desolations in the earth, making wars cease even to the end of the earth, He breaks the bow, shatters the spear, and burns the chariots<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> with fire. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2046:%208,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 46: 8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
In 
Judah God is known, in Israel His name is great, and in Salem will His tabernacle be, and His dwelling-place in Zion. There He broke the bow's fiery darts, the shield and the sword, and war. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2076:%201-3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 76: 1-3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
 Behold, the wicked bend the bow, they prepare their shafts upon the string to shoot in the darkness at the upright in heart. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2011:%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 11: 2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'bow and shafts' 
plainly stands for matters of doctrine concerning falsity.

Quod `arcus' sit doctrina veri, constat a significatione ejus; in Verbo ubicumque agitur de bellis et memorantur bella, in sensu interno non alia significantur bella quam spiritualia, n. 1664; fuerunt 
etiam libri in Antiqua Ecclesia qui inscripti Bella Jehovae, ut constat apud Mosen, Num. xxi 14-16, quae prophetico stilo conscripta {1} sensum internum habuerunt, et egerunt de Domini pugnis et tentationibus, 
tum de Ecclesiae, et illorum qui ab Ecclesia; quod exinde patet quia aliqua inde desumpta sunt a Mose; tum quoque a libris aliis Ecclesiae istius, qui vocati Libri Enuntiatorum propheticorum, 
de quibus Num. xxi 27-30, in quibus eadem paene verba sunt quae apud Jeremiam, conferantur Num. xxi 28 et Jer. xlviii 45: ex quibus etiam concludi potest quod Antiquae Ecclesiae fuerint scripta tam 
historica quam prophetica, quae Divina et inspirata, et quae in interno sensu agebant de Domino ac Ipsius regno, et quod illa iis Verbum, sicut nobis libri historici et prophetici, qui in sensu litterae 
agunt de Judaeis et Israelitis, sed in sensu interno de Domino et de illis quae Ipsius sunt.  [2] Quia `bellum' in Verbo, sicut etiam in  Antiquae Ecclesiae libris, significabat bellum spirituale, 
ita omnia arma, ut gladius, hasta, clypeus, scutum, tela, sagittae, et arcus significabant talia in specie quae sunt belli in spirituali sensu intellecti; de singulis armis, quid in specie significent, 
ex Divina Domini Misericordia, alibi dicetur; hic nunc quid `arcus,' quod nempe doctrinam veri, et hoc a telis, sagittis, seu {2} jaculis, quae sunt doctrinalia ex quibus et cum quibus pugnant illi 
imprimis qui spirituales sunt, qui inde olim dicti [sunt] jaculatores arcus: [3] quod `arcus' significet doctrinam veri, constare potest ab his locis: apud Esaiam, 	Jehovae tela acuta, et omnes arcus 
Ipsius tensi, ungulae equorum Ipsius sicut rupes reputantur, et rotae Ipsius sicut procella {3}, v 28; </p>
<p>ibi de veris doctrinae agitur; `tela' sunt vera spiritualia, `arcus' doctrina, `ungulae equorum' 
vera naturalia, `rotae' doctrina (c)eorum; quae quia talia significant, ideo Jehovae tribuuntur, Cui non tribui possunt nisi in sensu spirituali, aliter forent verba inania et non decentia: apud 
Jeremiam, 	Dominus tetendit arcum quum sicut inimicus {4}, constitit dextra Ipsius sicut hostis {4}, et occidit omnia desiderabilia oculi in tentorio filiae Zionis, effudit sicut ignem iram Suam Thren. 
ii 4; </p>
<p>`arcus' pro doctrina veri, quae apparet illis qui in falsis sicut {5} (t)inimicum et hostile, non alius arcus praedicari potest de Domino: apud Habakkuk, 	Jehovah equitas super equis Tuis, 
currus Tui salus, denudando denudabitur arcus Tuus, iii 8, 9; </p>
<p>ibi `arcus' etiam est doctrina boni et veri: apud Mosen, 	Exacerbabunt eum, et jaculabuntur, odio habebunt eum sagittarii, sedebit in firmo 
arcus sui, et roborabuntur brachia manuum ipsius a manibus fortis Jacobi, inde pastor, lapis Israelis, Gen. xlix 23, 24; </p>
<p>[4] ubi de Josepho; `arcus' pro doctrina boni et veri: apud Johannem, 	Vidi, 
cum ecce equus albus, et sedens super illo habens arcum, cui data est corona, Apoc. vi 2; </p>
<p>`equus albus' pro sapientia, `sedens super illo' pro Verbo, ut dicitur manifeste, xix 13, ubi de equo albo 
iterum agitur; et quia `sedens super illo' est Verbum, constat quod `arcus' sit doctrina veri: apud Esaiam, 	Quis excitavit ab oriente justitiam, vocavit eum ad sequelam Sui, dedit coram Ipso gentes, 
et regibus dominari 	fecit? dedit sicut pulverem gladio Suo, sicut stipulam propulsam arcu Suo, xli 2; </p>
<p>ubi agitur de Domino, `gladius' pro vero, {6} `arcus' pro doctrina ab Ipso apud eundem, 	Ponam 
in eis signum, et mittam ex eis evasores, ad gente Tarshish, Pul et Lud trahentes arcum, Tubal et Javan, lxvi 19; </p>
<p>`trahentes arcum' pro docentes doctrinam, quid Tarshish, videatur n. 1156; quid Lud, 
n. 1195, 1231; quid Tubal, n. 1151; quid Javan, n. 1152, 1153, 1155: [5] apud Jeremiam, 	Prae voce equitis et jacientis arcum, fugiens tota urbs, intrarunt in nubes, et in rupes ascenderunt, tota 
urbs deserta est, iv 29; </p>
<p>`eques' pro illis qui veram dicunt, `arcus' pro doctrina veri, quam fugiunt seu timent illi qui in falsis: apud eundem, 	Disponite aciem contra Babelem circumcirca; omnes tendentes 
arcum jacite ad eam, ne parcatis telo, quia Jehovae peccavit, l 14 {7}, 29; li 2, 3; </p>
<p>ubi `jacientes et tendentes arcum' pro dicentibus et docentibus doctrinam veri: [6] apud Zachariam, 	    
Exscindam currum ex Ephraimo, et equum ex Hierosolyma, 	et exscindetur arcus belli, et loquetur pacem gentibus, ix 10; </p>
<p>`Ephraimus' pro intellectu veri Ecclesiae, `arcus' pro doctrina: apud Samuelem, 	Lamentatus 
David lamentationem super Shaule, et super Jonathane, filio ejus, et dixit ad docendum filios Jehudae arcum, 2 Sam. i 17 [18]; </p>
<p>ubi de `arcu' non agitur, sed de doctrinalibus fidei: apud 
Ezechielem, 	Dictum Domini Jehovih, Hic dies de quo locutus sum, et exibunt habitatores urbium Israelis, et succendent et comburent arma, et scutum, et clypeum, arcum et tela, et baculum manus et hastam, 
et succendent in illis ignem septem annis, xxxix 9; </p>
<p>arma ibi nominata sunt omnia arma belli spiritualis; `arcus cum telis' pro doctrina et ejus veris: ipsa etiam vera separata a bonis apparent in 
altera vita, cum repraesentantur ad visum, sicut tela.  [7] Prout `arcus' significat doctrinam veri, etiam in opposito sensu significat doctrinam falsi; similia in Verbo ut plurimum sensum oppositum 
habent, ut passim dictum et ostensum; ut apud Jeremiam, 	Ecce populus veniens e terra septentrionis, et gens magna excitabitur e lateribus terrae, arcum et hastam prehendunt, crudelis illa, et non miserebuntur, 
vox eorum sicut mare tumultuabitur, super equis equitabunt, instructus tanquam vir ad bellum, contra te filia Zionis, vi 22, 23; </p>
<p>ubi `arcus' pro doctrina falsi: apud eundem, 	Ecce populus 
veniens e septentrione, et gens magna, ac reges multi excitabitur a lateribus terrae, arcum et hastam tenent, crudeles illi, et non miserentur, l [41], 42; </p>
<p>similiter: apud eundem, 	Tendunt linguam 
suam, arcus eorum mendacium, et non ad veritatem, praevalent in terra, quia e malo in {8} malum egressi sunt, et Me non noverunt, ix 1, 2 [A.V. 2, 3]; </p>
<p>quod `arcas' sit doctrina falsi, patet manifeste, 
nam dicitur quod `tendant linguam, arcus eorum mendacium, et non ad veritatem': [8] apud eundem, 	Dixit Jehovah Zebaoth, Ecce Ego frangens arcum Elami, principium fortitudinis ejus, xlix 35: </p>
<p>apud 
Davidem, 	Ite, videte opera Jehovae, qui ponit desolationes {9} in terra, cessare faciens bella usque ad extremitatem terrae, arcum frangit, concidit hastam, plaustra comburit igne, Ps. xlvi 9, 10 
[A.V. 8, 9]: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Notus in Jehuda Deus, in Israele magnum nomen Ipsius, et erit in Shalem tabernaculum Ipsius, et habitaculum Ipsius in Zione, ibi fregit jacula ignita arcus, scutum, et gladium, 
et bellum, Ps. lxxvi 2-4 [A.V. 1-3]: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Ecce impii tendunt arcum, praeparant sagittas suas super nervo, ad jaculandum in tenebris rectos corde, Ps. xi 2; </p>
<p>hic manifeste `arcus et sagittae'
