<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4222节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4222.</strong>至于大人与属于人的事物的对应关系，它是与人的一切事物，无论总体还是细节的一种对应关系。也就是说，它是与人的器官，部位并脏腑的一种对应关系，这种对应如此完全，以至于人体内没有一个器官或部位，任何器官或部位内没有一个部分，甚至任何部分中没有一个微小粒子不与大人有某种对应关系。众所周知，人体内的每个器官和每个部位都由各个部分，以及部分的部分组成。例如，脑通常由大脑，小脑，延髓和脊髓组成，后者是延伸物，或可以说是附件。而大脑由许多部位，也就是它的各个部分组成，即由被称为硬脑膜和软脑膜、胼胝体、纹状体、脑室和脑腔、小腺体、隔膜，以及总体上的脑灰质和髓质，加上窦道、血管和神经丛组成。从解剖学清楚可知，人体的感觉和运动器官，以及脏腑也一样。人体的所有这些部分，无论总体还是细节，皆最精确地对应于大人和那里的众多天堂。因为主的天堂以同样的方式分成较小的天堂，较小的天堂又分成更小的天堂，更小的天堂同样分成最小的天堂，最后最小的天堂分成一个天使，每一个天使都是一个对应于这个大人的微型天堂。这些天堂彼此截然不同，又相互分离，每一个皆属于自己的总体天堂，总体天堂又属于最总体或整体天堂，就是大人。</p>

As regards the correspondence of the Grand Man with the things that appertain to man, it is a correspondence with all things of him both in general and in particular, that is to say, with his organs, 
members, and viscera, and this so perfect that there is not a single organ or member in the body, nor any part in an organ or member, nor even any particle of a part, with which there is not correspondence. 
It is well known that each organ and member in the body consists of parts, and of parts of parts-as the brain, for example, which consists in general of the cerebrum, cerebellum, medulla oblongata, 
and medulla spinalis, for this last is a continuation, or kind of appendix. Again, the cerebrum consists of many members, which are its parts, namely, of the membranes called the dura mater and 
pia mater, of the corpus callosum, the corpora striata, the ventricles and cavities, the smaller glands, the septa, in general of the cineritious substance and the medullary substance, and furthermore 
of the sinuses, blood vessels, and plexuses. The like is the case with the bodily organs of sense and motion, and with the viscera, as is well known from anatomical studies. All these things both in 
general and in particular correspond most exactly to the Grand Man, and to so many heavens, as it were, therein. For the heaven of the Lord is distinguished in like manner into lesser heavens, and these 
into heavens still less, and these into least, and finally into angels, each one of whom is a little heaven corresponding to the greatest. These heavens are most distinct from one another, each one 
belonging to its own general heaven, and the general heavens to the most general, or whole, which is the Grand Man. </p>

As regards the correspondence of the Grand Man with the things present in man, this is a correspondence with every single part of him. That is to say, it is a correspondence with his organs, members, 
and viscera, in so much indeed that not one organ or member exists in the body, not one part within any organ or member, nor even one small part of any part, with which there is no correspondence. It 
is well known that every organ and every member within the body consists of parts, and of parts of the parts. The brain, for example, consists in general of the cerebrum, the cerebellum, the medulla 
oblongata, and the medulla spinalis, the latter being a continuation or so to speak appendage. But the cerebrum consists of many members which are its parts, namely the membranes called the dura mater 
and the pia mater, the corpus callosum, the corpora striate, the ventricles and cavities, the smaller glands, the septa, in general the cineritious substance and the medullary substance, in addition 
to sinuses, blood vessels, and plexuses. It is similar with the sensory and motor organs of the body, and with the viscera, as is well known from anatomical studies. All these parts of the body in general 
and in particular correspond most exactly to the Grand Man, being as many in number so to speak as the heavens. For the Lord's heaven in a similar way divides up into smaller heavens; the smaller 
into those that are smaller still; the smaller still into the smallest; and lastly the smallest into individual angels, of whom each one is a miniature heaven corresponding to the grand one. These heavens 
are quite distinct and separate from one another, yet each one belongs to its own general heaven, and the general heavens to the most general or whole, which is the Grand Man. </p>

Quod correspondentiam Maximi Hominis cum illis quae apud hominem, attinet, illa est cum omnibus et {1} singulis ejus, nempe cum ejus organis, membris et visceribus, et quidem in tantum ut non detur 
aliquod organum (c)et membrum in corpore, nec aliqua pars in organo et membro, ne quidem aliqua particula partis, cum qua non correspondentia sit; notum est quod unumquodvis organum et unumquodvis 
membrum in corpore, consistat ex partibus et ex partium partibus; sicut cerebrum, hoc in communi consistit {2} a cerebro proprie dicto, a cerebello, a medulla oblongata, et medulla spinali, nam 
haec est continuatio aut quasi appendix; cerebrum autem proprie dictum consistit a pluribus membris quae sunt partes ejus, nempe a membranis quae dura mater et pia mater vocantur, a corpore calloso, 
a corporibus {3} striatis, a ventriculis et cavis, a glandulis minoribus, a septis, in genere a substantia cineritia et a substantia medullari, praeter a sinubus, vasis sanguineis et plexibus; similiter 
se habet cum organis sensoriis et motoriis corporis, et cum visceribus, quod ex anatomicis satis `notum est': </p>
<p>omnia illa in communi et in particulari correspondent exactissime Maximo Homini, 
ac ibi totidem quasi caelis; caelum enim Domini similiter distinctum est in minores caelos, et hi in adhuc minores, et (o)hi in minimos, tandem in angelos, quorum unusquisque est exiguum caelum correspondens 
maximo: caeli illi sunt distinctissimi inter se, unumquodvis pertinens ad commune suum, et communes caeli ad communissimum seu totum {5}, quod est Maximus Homo.      @1 et cum omnibus
