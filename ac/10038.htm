<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10038节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10038</strong>.“都要用火烧在营外”表这些事物必须被逐入地狱，被自我之爱的邪恶吞灭。这从“用火烧”和“营”的含义清楚可知：“用火烧”是指被自我之爱的邪恶吞灭，“烧”表示吞灭或摧毁，“火”表示自我之爱的邪恶（参看<a href="1297.htm">1297</a>，<a href="5071.htm">5071</a>，<a href="5215.htm">5215</a>，<a href="6314.htm">6314</a>，<a href="6832.htm">6832</a>，<a href="7324.htm">7324</a>，<a href="7575.htm">7575</a>，<a href="9141.htm">9141</a>，<a href="9434.htm">9434</a>节）；“营”是指天堂和教会，在反面意义上是指天堂和教会不存在的地方，因而是指地狱存在的地方，如下文所述。“用火烧”之所以表示被自我之爱的邪恶吞灭，是因为这爱吞灭一切信之良善与真理。如今几乎没有人知道这爱是这样的，因而也不知道这爱构成与人同在的地狱，这才是“地狱之火”的意思。<br />有两种生命之火与人同在；一种是自我之爱，另一种是对神之爱。那些自我之爱在其中占主导地位的人不可能处于对神之爱，因为这些爱是对立面。它们之所以是对立面，是因为自我之爱产生一切邪恶，这些邪恶就是与自己相比对他人的蔑视，对那些不偏向自己之人的敌意，以及最终的仇恨、报复、残暴和残忍；这些邪恶与神性流注完全对立，因而消灭信与仁的真理与良善，因为这些就是那从主流入的事物。凡停下来反思的人都能知道，每个人的爱都是他的生命之火；因为没有爱，就没有生命，爱如何，生命就如何，或说爱的性质决定生命的性质；由此可知，自我之爱产生各种邪恶，并且人只关注自己，也就是说，自我之爱在他里面掌权到何等程度，这爱就在何等程度上产生邪恶。最糟糕的自我之爱是为了自己而对掌权或统治的爱，也就是说，喜爱掌权只是为了地位和利益。诚然，这爱在其中占主导地位的人也能拥有信和仁；但他们只是口上拥有，心里并没有。事实上，他们当中最坏的人将属于信与仁的事物，因而将教会的神圣事物视为达到自己目的的手段。不过，蒙主的神性怜悯，我将在别处详述自我之爱及其各种不同类型，以及从这爱涌出的邪恶和自私的人在来世的景况。在此提及这些事，是为了能叫人们知道“用火烧在营外”是什么意思。<br />以色列所安的“营”代表天堂和教会，因此，“营外”代表天堂和教会不存在的地方，因而代表地狱，这一点从圣言中提到以色列人在旷野中的营地和安营的地方清楚看出来，如以下摩西五经中的话：<br />以色列人安营，要照他们的军队，各人归本营，各人归本旗。利未人要在法柜居所的四围安营，免得忿怒临到以色列人的会众。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民1.52.htm">1:52</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民1.53.htm">53</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民2.2.htm">2:2</a>）<br />民数记：<br />犹大、以萨迦和西布伦的支派在东边安营；流便、西缅和迦得的支派在南边安营；以法莲、玛拿西和便雅悯的支派在西边安营；但、亚设和拿弗他利的支派在北边安营；但利未人在营中间。（民数记2章）<br />他们按这种次序安营，是为了叫他们可以代表天堂和教会（<a href="9320.htm">9320</a>e节）。此外，以色列人安营所依照的各支派代表整体上属于天堂和教会的一切良善和一切真理（<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="3926.htm">3926</a>，<a href="3939.htm">3939</a>，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>，<a href="6335.htm">6335</a>，<a href="6337.htm">6337</a>，<a href="6397.htm">6397</a>，<a href="6640.htm">6640</a>，<a href="7836.htm">7836</a>，<a href="7891.htm">7891</a>，<a href="7996.htm">7996</a>，<a href="7997.htm">7997</a>节）。这解释了为何经上说“耶和华住在营中间”（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民5.3.htm">5:3</a>）；“祂在营中间行走，所以营要圣洁”（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申23.14.htm">23:14</a>）；又为何在巴兰所发的预言中，经上说“巴兰看见以色列照着支派居住，他说，雅各啊，你的帐棚何等华美！以色列啊，你的居所何其华丽”（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.2.htm">24:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.5.htm">5</a>）。<br />由于营代表天堂和教会，故可知，“营外”表示天堂和教会不存在的地方，因而代表地狱；这就是为何凡不洁之人，以及凡有罪的人都被送到营外，这从下列经文可以看出来：<br />你要把一切长大麻疯的，一切患漏症的，并一切因一个灵魂而不洁净的，都送到营外去。无论男女，都要把他们送到营外，免得他们玷污营地，耶和华住在营中间。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民5.2.htm">5:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民5.3.htm">3</a>；利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利13.45.htm">13:45</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利13.46.htm">46</a>）<br />申命记：<br />若有人夜里因意外事而不洁净，就要出到营外，不可进入营中间。他要用水洗澡，及至日落了才可以入营。你在营外要有一个地方，你可以出去在那里方便。你要用一把锹掩盖你的粪便，因为耶和华要在营中间行走，所以营要圣洁。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申23.10.htm">23:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申23.14.htm">14</a>）<br />经上还吩咐，要在营外用石头打死人（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利24.14.htm">24:14</a>；民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.35.htm">15:35</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.36.htm">36</a>）。由此明显可知“小公牛的肉、皮、粪都要用火烧在营外”表示这些事物所表示的邪恶必须被逐入地狱。<br />营和营外的区域所代表的那些事物也由迦南地作为产业在以色列人当中被划分之后的迦南地和那地周围的地来代表。这就是为何在圣言中，“迦南地”或仅仅“地”表示天堂和教会，“以色列人”表示那些在天堂和教会里的人。“地”表示天堂和教会（参看<a href="9325.htm">9325</a>节所提到的地方）；“以色列人”表示那些在那里的人（参看<a href="9340.htm">9340</a>节）。</p>

Shalt thou burn with fire without the camp. That this signifies that those things were to be committed to hell, and to be defiled with the evils of the love of self, is evident from the signification 
of "burning with fire," as being to consume with the evils of the love of self; for by "burning" is signified consuming, and by "fire" the evil of the love of self (see n. 1297, 5071, 5215, 6314, 6832, 
7324, 7575, 9141, 9434); and from the signification of "the camp," as being heaven and the church, and in the opposite sense where heaven and the church are not, thus hell (of which in what follows). 
That "to be burned with fire" denotes to be consumed by the evils of the love of self, is because this love consumes all the goods and truths of faith. That the love of self does this is known to scarcely 
anyone at this day, and consequently neither is it known that this love is hell with man, and that it is meant by "hell fire." [2] For there are two fires of life with man; one is the love of 
self, the other is love to God. They who are in the love of self cannot be in love to God, because these loves are opposite. They are opposite because the love of self produces all evils, which are contempt 
for others in comparison with self, enmity against those who do not favor, and finally hatreds, revenges, ferocities, cruelties; which evils wholly resist the Divine influx, and consequently extinguish 
the truths and goods of faith and of charity, for these are what flow in from the Lord. Anyone who reflects is able to know that everyone's love is the fire of his life; for without love there 
is no life, and such as the love is such is the life; and from this it can be known that the love of self produces evils of every kind, and that it so far produces them as it is regarded as the end, 
that is, so far as it reigns. The worst kind of the love of self is the love of ruling for the sake of self, that is, solely for the sake of honor and self-advantage. They who are in this love are indeed 
able to make a profession of faith and charity; but they do this with the mouth, and not with the heart; nay, the worst of them regard the things of faith and charity, thus the holy things of the 
church, as means to attain their ends. But of the Lord's Divine mercy I will speak specifically of the love of self, and its various kinds, and the evils that spring from it, and of the state of such 
in the other life. These things have been said that it may be known what is denoted by being "burnt with fire without the camp."  [3] That the camp where the sons of Israel encamped represented heaven 
and the church, and hence that "without the camp" denotes where heaven and the church are not, thus hell, can be seen from what is related in the Word about the camp and the encamping of the sons 
of Israel in the wilderness, as from these words in Moses: </p>
<p>     The sons of Israel shall encamp, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, according to their armies; and the Levites 
shall encamp around the Habitation of the testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the sons of Israel (Num. 1:52, 53; 2:2).      The tribes of Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun encamped 
to the east; the tribes of Reuben, Simeon, and Gad to the south; the tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin to the west; and the tribes of Dan, Asher, and Naphtali to the north; but the Levites 
in the midst of the camp (Num. 2:10). Their encampments were so ordered that they might represent heaven and the church (n. 9320); by the tribes also, according to which they encamped, were represented 
all the goods and truths of heaven and the church in the complex (n. 3858, 3926, 3939, 4060, 6335, 6337, 6397, 6640, 7836, 7891, 7996, 7997); hence it is said that "Jehovah dwelt in the midst of the 
camp" (Num. 5:3), and that "He walketh in the midst of them, and therefore they shall be holy" (Deut. 23:14); and in the prophetic utterance of Balaam it is said, "when he saw Israel dwelling according 
to their tribes, he said, How good are thy tabernacles, O Jacob, and thy habitations, O Israel" (Num. 24:2, 3, 5). [4] As by the camp was represented heaven and the church, it follows that by "without 
the camp" was signified where heaven and the church are not, thus hell; and therefore everyone that was unclean and also that was guilty was sent forth thither, as can be seen from the following 
passages: </p>
<p>     Ye shall send forth out of the camp every leper, and everyone that suffereth with an issue, everyone unclean on account of a soul, from a male even to a female, ye shall send them abroad 
out of the camp, that they pollute not the camp, in the midst of which Jehovah dwelleth (Num. 5:2, 3; Lev. 13:45, 46).      A man that is not clean by chance of the night shall go abroad out of the 
camp, and shall not come into the midst of the camp; when he shall wash himself in waters, and the sun hath set, he shall enter into the camp. Thou shalt have a space without the camp, whither thou 
mayest go forth abroad, and thou shall cover thine excrement with a paddle, because Jehovah walketh in the midst of the camp; therefore the camp shall be holy (Deut. 23:10-15). It was also commanded 
that persons should be stoned "without the camp" (Lev. 24:14; Num. 15:35, 36). From all this it is now evident that by "burning with fire the flesh, skin, and dung of the bullock without the camp," is 
signified that the evils which are signified by these things were to be committed to hell. [5] The like that was represented by the camp, and without the camp, was also represented by the land of Canaan 
and the lands round about it, after that land had been distributed for inheritances among the sons of Israel. From this it is that by the "land of Canaan," and simply by "land," in the Word, are 
signified heaven and the church, and by the "sons of Israel" those who are in heaven and the church. (That by "land" [or "earth"] is signified heaven and the church, see the places cited in n. 9325; 
and that by the "sons of Israel" are signified those who are there, n. 9340.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10038</b></p><p><b>10038.</b>
'You shall burn with fire outside the camp' means that those things must be banished to hell and be consumed by the evils of self-love. This is clear from the meaning of 'burning with fire' as consuming 
by means of the evils of self-love, for 'burning' means consuming or devouring and 'fire' the evil of self-love (for these meanings of 'burning' and 'fire', see <a href="1297.htm">1297</a>, <a href="5071.htm">5071</a>, <a href="5215.htm">5215</a>, <a href="6314.htm">6314</a>, <a href="6832.htm">6832</a>, <a href="7324.htm">7324</a>, <a href="7575.htm">7575</a>, <a href="9141.htm">9141</a>, <a href="9434.htm">9434</a>); and from the meaning of 'the camp' as heaven and the Church, and in the contrary sense the place where heaven and the Church do not exist, thus where hell exists, dealt with below. 
The reason why 'being burned with fire' means being consumed by the evils of self-love is that that love consumes every good or truth of faith. Scarcely anyone at the present day knows that self-love 
does this, nor consequently that this love constitutes hell with a person and that it is what should be understood by hell-fire.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 There are two fires of life that exist with a person; one is self-love, 
the other is love to God. Those in whom self-love predominates cannot be governed by love to God, for those loves are opposites. They are opposites because self-love gives rise to all evils, 
which are contempt for others in comparison with self, enmity towards those who do not treat oneself favourably, and in the end to hatred, vengeance, brutality, and cruelty; and these evils act in total 
opposition to Divine influx, consequently annihilate truths and forms of the good of faith and charity, these being the things that flow in from the Lord. Anybody who stops to reflect may know that 
everyone's love is the fire of his life - for without love there is no life, and the character of the love determines that of the life - and therefore that self-love gives rise to evils of every kind, 
doing so in the measure that he has only himself in view, that is, self-love reigns in him. The worst kind of self-love is the love of dominion over others for selfish reasons, that is, the love of 
possessing dominion solely for the sake of position and gain. Those in whom that love predominates may, it is true, make profession of faith and charity, but they do so with their lips, not with their 
heart; indeed the worst among them look on the things that belong to faith and charity, thus the holy things of the Church, as means to their own ends. But self-love and all the different types of it, 
also the evils that gush out of it, and the condition of the selfish in the next life, must in the Lord's Divine mercy be stated in detail somewhere else. They have been referred to here to enable 
people to know what 'being burned with fire outside the camp' means.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The fact that 'the camp' where the children of Israel were encamped represented heaven and the Church, and therefore that 'outside 
the camp' represented the place where heaven and the Church did not exist, thus where hell was, becomes clear from those places in the Word which mention the camp and the encampment of the children 
of Israel in the wilderness, such as the following in Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
The children of Israel shall camp, [every] man by his own camp, and [every] man by his own standard, according to their armies. And 
the Levites shall camp around the dwelling-place of the Testimony, that there may be no wrath on the congregation of the children of Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%201:52,53;%202:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 1:52,53; 2:2</a>.  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
In addition, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%202:1-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 2:1-end</a> 
</blockquote>
says that 
the tribes of Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun encamped to the east; the tribes of Reuben, Simeon, and Gad to the south; the tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin to the west; and the tribes of Dan, 
Asher, and Naphtali to the north. But the Levites were in the middle of their camps. The like applied when they set out on their journeys, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%202:17;%2010:1-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 2:17; 10:1-end</a>. The reason why their encampments were 
arranged in that kind of order was so that they might represent heaven and the Church, <a href="9320.htm">9320</a>(end). Moreover the tribes according to which the children of Israel set up their camps represented all the forms 
of good and all the truths in their entirety that belonged to heaven and the Church, <a href="3858.htm">3858</a>, <a href="3926.htm">3926</a>, <a href="3939.htm">3939</a>, <a href="4060.htm">4060</a>, <a href="6335.htm">6335</a>, <a href="6337.htm">6337</a>, <a href="6397.htm">6397</a>, <a href="6640.htm">6640</a>, <a href="7836.htm">7836</a>, <a href="7891.htm">7891</a>, <a href="7996.htm">7996</a>, <a href="7997.htm">7997</a>. This explains why it says that Jehovah 
dwells in the middle of the camps, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%205:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 5:3</a>, and that He walks in the middle of them and they will therefore be holy, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2023:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 23:14</a>, and why, in the prophecy uttered by Balaam, when he saw Israel dwelling 
according to their tribes, he said, How good are your tabernacles, O Jacob, and your dwelling-places, O Israel! <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2024:2,3,5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 24:2,3,5</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Since heaven and the Church was represented by the camp it follows 
that 'outside the camp' meant the place where neither heaven nor the Church existed, thus where hell was. That is why everyone who was unclean and also anyone who was guilty was sent out there, 
as may be recognized from the following,  </p>
<blockquote>
You shall send out of the camp everyone who is leprous, and everyone suffering a discharge, and everyone unclean on account of a soul<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>. Whether they are male 
or female<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> you shall send them outside the camp, so that they may not defile the camps, in the middle of which Jehovah dwells. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%205:2,3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 5:2,3</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2013:45,46&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 13:45,46</a>.  
</blockquote>
A man who is not clean by reason of an accident 
in the night shall go outside the camp and not come into the middle of the camp. When he has washed himself with water and the sun has set he shall enter the camp. There shall be a space for you 
outside the camp where you may go out, and you shall cover your excrement by means of a spade<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a>, since Jehovah walks in the middle of the camp. Therefore the camp shall be holy. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2023:10-14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 23:10-14</a>.  </p>
<blockquote>
And 
the stoning of people was done outside the camp, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2024:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 24:14</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2015:35,36&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 15:35,36</a>.  
</blockquote>
From all this it is now clear that 'you shall burn with fire the flesh, skin, and dung of the young bull, outside the 
camp' means that evils, meant by these things, must be banished to hell.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 The same thing as was represented by the camp and the area outside it was also represented by the land of Canaan and 
the lands around it after that land had been divided up as inheritances among the children of Israel. This is why in the Word 'the land of Canaan' or simply 'the land' means heaven and the Church, and 
'the children of Israel' those who are in heaven and the Church. For the meaning of 'the land' as heaven and the Church, see the places referred to in <a href="9325.htm">9325</a>; and for that of 'the children of Israel' as 
those who are there, <a href="9340.htm">9340</a>.

`Combures igne extra castra': quod significet quod illa amandanda (o)sint inferno, et consumenda {1} malis amoris sui, constat ex significatione `comburere igne' quod sit consumere malis amoris sui; 
per `comburere' enim significatur consumere, et per ignem' malum amoris sui; quod (c)illa per `comburere' et per `ignem' significentur, videatur n. 1297, 5071, (x)5215, 6314, 6832, 7324, 7575, (x)9141, 
9434; et ex significatione `castrorum' quod sint caelum et Ecclesia, et in opposito sensu ubi non caelum et Ecclesia, ita infernum, de qua sequitur.  Quod comburi igne sit consumi malis amoris sui, 
est quia ille amor consumit omnia bona et vera fidei; quod amor sui id faciat, vix aliquis hodie novit, et inde nec quod ille amor sit infernum apud hominem, et quod ille intelligatur per ignem infernalem. 	[2] 
Sunt enim duo ignes vitae apud hominem, unus est amor sui, alter est amor in Deum; qui in amore sui sunt non possunt esse in amore in Deum, quoniam oppositi sunt; quod oppositi sint, est 
quia amor sui producit omnia mala, quae sunt (x)contemptus aliorum prae se, (x)inimicitia contra illos qui non favent, tandem odia, (x)vindictae, saevitiae, {2} crudelitates, quae mala prorsus resistunt 
influxui Divino, consequenter exstinguunt vera et bona {3} fidei et charitatis {4}, (o)nam haec sunt quae influunt a Domino; quod amor cujusvis sit ignis vitae ejus, quisque scire potest qui reflectit, 
nam absque amore non vita, et qualis amor talis vita; et inde {5} quod amor sui producat mala omnis generis, et quod tantum producat, quantum pro fine habetur, hoc est, quantum regnat; genus pessimum 
amoris sui est amor dominandi propter se, hoc est, solum propter {6} honorem et propter lucrum; qui in (c)illo amore sunt, {7} quidem profiteri possunt fidem et charitatem, sed hoc faciunt ore et 
non corde; immo qui eorum pessimi sunt, illa quae fidei et charitatis sunt, ita sancta Ecclesiae, pro mediis ad fines suos habent; sed de amore sui et de ejus generibus, deque malis inde scaturientibus, 
et de {8} statu illorum in altera vita, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, {9} in specie dicendum est; haec dicta sunt ut sciatur quid sit `comburi igne extra castra.' 	[3] Quod castra, ubi filii Israelis 
castrametati sunt, repraesentaverint caelum et Ecclesiam, (c)ac inde quod extra castra sit ubi non caelum et Ecclesia, ita infernum, constare potest ex illis in Verbo quae de castris et de castrametatione 
filiorum Israelis in deserto memorantur, ut ex his apud Moschen,      	Filii Israelis castrametabuntur vir apud castra sua, et vir apud vexillum suum, juxta exercitus eorum; et Levitae castrametabuntur 
arcum habitaculum testimonii, ut non sit excandescentia super congregationem filiorum Israelis, Num. i (x)52, 53, ii 2: </p>
<p>et porro, castrametabatur tribus Jehudae, Jisaschar, et Sebulonis 
ad orientem; tribus Rubenis, Schimeonis, et Gadis ad meridiem; tribus Ephraim, Menascheh, Benjamin ad occidentem; ac tribus Danis, Ascheris, et Naphtali ad septentrionem; Levitae autem in medio castrorum, 
Num. ii 1-fin.; et quod similiter proficiscerentur, Num. ii 17, x 1-fin.; quod castrametationes (c)eorum ita ordinatae fuerint, erat ut repraesentarent caelum et Ecclesiam, n. 9320 fin.; per tribus 
etiam, secundum quas castrametabantur, repraesentabantur omnia bona et vera caeli et Ecclesiae in complexu, n. 3858, 3926, 3939, 4060, 6335, 6337, 6397, 6640, 7836, 7891, 7996, 7997; inde est quod 
dicatur quod Jehovah habitet in medio castrorum, (x)Num. v 3, et quod ambulet in medio eorum, ac ideo sancta erunt, Deut. xxiii (x)15 [A. V. 14], et in enuntiato prophetico Bileami, Cum vidit Israelem 
habitantem juxta tribus, (o)dixit, Quam bona sunt tabernacula tua, Jacob, et habitacula tua, Israel! Num. xxiv 2, 3, 5. 	[4] Quia per castra repraesentabatur caelum et Ecclesia, sequitur quod per `extra 
castra' significatum sit ubi non caelum et non Ecclesia, ita infernum; quapropter illuc emittebatur omnis immundus, et quoque reus {10}, ut {11} constare potest ex his sequentibus,      	Emittetis 
e castris omnem leprosum, et omnem fluxum patientem, omnem immundum propter animam, a masculo usque ad feminam, foras extra castra mittetis eos, ut non polluant castra, in quorum medio Jehovah habitat, 
Num. v 2, 3; (o)Lev. xiii (x)45, 46: </p>
<p>     	Vir qui non {12} mundus casu noctis, exhibit foras extra castra, nec veniet in medium {13} castrorum: cum laverit se aquis, et occiderit sol, intrabit 
in castra.  Spatium erit tibi extra castra quo foras exeas, et per clavum conteges excrementum tuum, quia Jehovah ambulat in medio castrorum; ideo castra sancta erunt, Deut. xxiii 11-15 [A.V. 10-14]: </p>
<p>et 
quod lapidarentur extra castra, Lev. xxiv 14; Num. xv 35, 36.  (o)Ex his nunc constat quod per `combures igne carnem, pellem, et fimum juvenci, extra castra' significetur quod mala, quae per illa 
significantur, amandanda sint inferno. 	[5] Simile quod per castra et {14} per extra castra, (o)etiam per terram Canaanem, et per terras circum illam, postquam terra illa inter filios {15} Israelis 
in hereditates distributa fuit, repraesentatum est {16}; inde est quod per `terram Canaanem,' ac simpliciter per `terram,' in Verbo significetur caelum et Ecclesia, (d)et per `filios Israelis' {17} qui 
in caelo et in Ecclesia; quod per `terram' caelum {18} et Ecclesia significetur, videantur citata n. 9325, et quod per `filios Israelis' illi qui ibi, n. 9340. @1 conspurcanda IT$ @2 i et$ @3 i quae$ @4
