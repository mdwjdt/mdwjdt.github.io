Verses 28-32. This is the word that I spoke unto Pharaoh; what God doeth He hath caused Pharaoh to see. Behold there come seven years of great abundance of produce in all the land of Egypt; and there 
shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the abundance of produce shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land; and the abundance of produce shall not be 
known in the land by reason of that famine after it, for it shall be very grievous. And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice, it is because the word is established by God, and God is hastening 
to do it.  "This is the word that I spoke unto Pharaoh," signifies what the natural thought from the celestial of the spiritual; "what God doeth," signifies concerning what is provided; "He hath 
caused Pharaoh to see," signifies the perception of the natural; "behold there come seven years," signifies states of providence; "of great abundance of produce in all the land of Egypt," signifies 
the multiplication of truth in both naturals; "and there shall arise after them seven years of famine," signifies the states that follow when there is a lack of truth; "and all the abundance of produce 
shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt," signifies the removal of truth and the apparent privation of it in both naturals; "and the famine shall consume the land," signifies even to despair; "and 
the abundance of produce shall not be known in the land," signifies that nothing shall be perceived therein of truth previously there; "by reason of that famine after it, for it shall be very grievous," 
signifies on account of such a lack; "and for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice," signifies because foreseen concerning both naturals; "it is because the word is established by God," signifies 
that it is Divine; "and God is hastening to do it," signifies in every event. </p>

Verses 28-32 This is the word which I have spoken to Pharaoh; what God is doing He has caused Pharaoh to see. Behold, seven years are coming, [in which there will be] a great abundance of corn in all 
the land of Egypt. And seven years of famine will arise after them, and all the abundance of corn in the land of Egypt will be thrust into oblivion, and the famine will consume the land. And the abundance 
of corn in the land will not be known because of the famine from then on, for it will be extremely severe. And as for the dream being presented<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> to Pharaoh twice, this is because the thing is established 
by God, and God is hastening to do it. </p>
<p>'This is the word which I have spoken to Pharaoh' means what the natural was led to think by the celestial of the spiritual. 'What God is doing' means 
regarding what was provided. 'He has caused Pharaoh to see' means discernment by the natural. 'Behold, seven years are coming' means a state of providence. 'A great abundance of corn in all the land 
of Egypt' means the multiplication of truth in both parts of the natural. 'And seven years of famine will arise after them' means subsequent states when there will be an absence of truth. 'And all the 
abundance of corn in the land of Egypt will be thrust into oblivion' means the removal of truth and the seeming deprivation of it in both parts of the natural. 'And the famine will consume the land' 
means even to the point of despair. 'And the abundance of corn in the land will not be known' means that no discernment at all regarding the truth present previously will exist there. 'Because of the 
famine from then on, for it will be extremely severe' means on account of such an absence [of truth]. 'And as for the dream being presented to Pharaoh twice' means because what was foreseen had regard 
to both parts of the natural. 'This is because the thing is established by God' means that it is Divine. 'And God is hastening to do it' means a total fulfillment.

Vers. 28-32.  Hoc verbum quod locutus sum ad Pharaonem, quod Deus faciens, videre fecit Pharaonem. Ecce septem anni veniunt, abundantia annonae magna in omni terra Aegypti. Et surgent septem anni famis 
post eos, et oblivioni dabitur omnis abundantia annonae in terra Aegypti, et consumet fames terram. Et non cognoscetur abundantia annonae in terra a coram fame illa posthac, quia gravis ea valde. 
Et super iterari somnium ad Pharaonem duabus vicibus, quia stabilitum verbum a cum Deo, et festinans Deus facere illud. `Hoc verbum quod locutus sum ad Pharaonem' significat quod cogitavit naturale e 
caelesti spiritualis: `quod Deus faciens' significat de proviso: `videre fecit Pharaonem' significat apperceptionem naturalis: `ecce septem anni veniunt' significat status providentiae: `abundantia annonae 
magna in omni terra Aegypti' significat multiplicationem veri in utroque naturali: `et surgent septem anni famis post eos' significat status sequentes cum defectus veri: `et oblivioni dabitur omnis 
abundantia annonae in terra Aegypti' significat remotionem veri et privationem ejus apparentem in utroque naturali:  `et consumet fames terram' significat usque ad desperationem: `et non cognoscetur 
abundantia annonae in terra' significat quod nihil de vero quod prius, appercipietur ibi: `a coram fame illa posthac, quia gravis ea valde' significat ob defectum talem: `et super iterari somnium ad 
Pharaonem duabus vicibus' significat quia {1}provisum de utroque naturali: `quia stabilitum verbum a cum Deo' significat quod sit Divinum: `et festinans Deus facere illud' significat cum omni eventu.
