<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8974节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8974.</strong>“你若买一个希伯来奴仆”表教会中那些充满教义真理，却未充满与这些真理相一致的良善之人。这从“买”和“希伯来奴仆”的含义清楚可知：“买”是指为自己获取并变成自己的（参看<a href="4397.htm">4397</a>，<a href="5374.htm">5374</a>，<a href="5397.htm">5397</a>，<a href="5406.htm">5406</a>，<a href="5410.htm">5410</a>，<a href="5426.htm">5426</a>，<a href="7999.htm">7999</a>节）；“希伯来奴仆”是指教会中那些充满教义的真理，却未充满与这些真理相一致的良善之人。因为“奴仆”或“仆人”论及那些充满真理，却未充满相应的良善之人，一般论及相对于良善的真理（<a href="3409.htm">3409</a>节）。“希伯来”论及那些与教会有关的事物，以及那些与某种奴役有关的事物；至于它论及那些与教会有关的事物，可参看前文（<a href="5136.htm">5136</a>，<a href="5236.htm">5236</a>，<a href="6675.htm">6675</a>，<a href="6684.htm">6684</a>节），还论及那些与某种奴役有关的事物（<a href="1703.htm">1703</a>，<a href="1741.htm">1741</a>，<a href="5013.htm">5013</a>节）。由于接下来的规定涉及以色列人的仆婢，所以必须阐明关于他们的律例在内义上包含什么。谁都能看出，律例包含天堂的奥秘在里面，因为它们是由耶和华在西乃山上向摩西口头宣布和吩咐的，还因为它们是紧跟着十诫的话而来的。没有这类奥秘，它们不过是些民法和刑法而已，和世上其它民族的法律一样，这些法律并没有任何天堂的奥秘在里面。但它们所包含的奥秘只显明给天上的天使，因而若不通过内义，对世人来说并不明显；因为内义教导天使是如何理解圣言的，因而教导圣言里面的奥秘。至于这些奥秘是什么，是何性质，这从下面对各个细节的解释明显可知。<br />为叫人对这些事物有一个大体的概念，需要作一个简短的陈述以说明“希伯来奴仆”在内义上具体表示什么。以色列人所代表的属灵教会有两种人：有些人充满信之真理，却未充满相应的生活良善，有些人则充满仁之良善，并充满相应的信之真理。充满仁之良善和相应的信之真理的人构成真正的教会本身，或教会最纯粹的部分，是内在教会成员。在圣言的内义中，他们就是那些被称为“以色列人”的人。这些人本身是自由的，因为他们充满良善；事实上，那些被主通过良善引导的人是自由的（<a href="892.htm">892</a>，<a href="905.htm">905</a>，<a href="2870.htm">2870</a>-<a href="2893.htm">2893</a>节）。然而，那些充满信之真理，却未充满相应的生活良善之人是外在属灵教会的成员。他们是那些在圣言的内义中由“希伯来奴仆”所表示的人。这些人之所以由奴仆或仆人来代表，是因为属于外在教会的事物相对来说无非是一群仆人，或服事的事物。信之真理相对于仁之良善也是这种情况；因为信之真理像一个仆人那样将一个教会成员引入仁之良善。<br />另外，要知道，那些认为教会的一切，因而得救的一切在于信之真理，不在于仁之良善的人，以及那些仅出于服从的灵，而非出于爱与情感行善的人，无法像那些充满仁之良善，也就是出于爱与情感行善的人那样重生。诚然，他们能被改造，但不能重生。他们的改造就是此处在关于仆婢的律法的内义上所论述的主题。如今这种改造的奥秘不为任何人所知，因为在教会的几乎各个地方，人们都不知道信之真理能对得救产生什么影响，仁之良善又能产生什么影响。事实上，人们不知道何为仁，也不知道仁与信必须结合起来才能使教会的某种事物存在于人里面，或在人里面形成；良善与真理的婚姻是教会本身，因为该婚姻就是人里面的天堂（<a href="2173.htm">2173</a>，<a href="2618.htm">2618</a>，<a href="2728.htm">2728</a>，<a href="2729.htm">2729</a>，<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>，<a href="3132.htm">3132</a>，<a href="3155.htm">3155</a>，<a href="4434.htm">4434</a>，<a href="4823.htm">4823</a>，<a href="5194.htm">5194</a>，<a href="5502.htm">5502</a>，<a href="6179.htm">6179</a>节）。</p>

When thou shalt buy a Hebrew servant. That this signifies those within the church who are in the truths of doctrine and not in good according to them, is evident from the signification of "buying," as 
being to procure and appropriate to oneself (see n. 4397, 5374, 5397, 5406, 5410, 5426, 7999); and from the signification of "a Hebrew servant," as being those within the church who are in the truths 
of doctrine and not in good of life according to them; for "servant" is predicated of those who are in truth and not in the corresponding good, and in general, of truth relatively to good (n. 3409), 
and "Hebrew" is predicated of those things which are of the church, and of those things which are of some service (that it is predicated of those things which are of the church, see n. 5136, 5236, 6675, 
6684; also that it is predicated of those things which are of some service, n. 1703, 1741, 5013). As in what now follows, the menservants and maidservants of the sons of Israel are treated of, it 
must be told what the statutes concerning them involve in the internal sense. Everyone can see that the statutes contain within them secret things of heaven, because they were spoken and commanded orally 
by Jehovah to Moses on Mount Sinai, and because they follow immediately after the words of the Decalogue. Apart from such secret things they would be merely civil and public laws like the laws of 
other nations on earth, in which there is no secret thing of heaven. But the secret things here contained are not manifest except to the angels in the heavens, consequently not to men except by the internal 
sense; for this teaches how the angels perceive the Word, consequently it teaches the secret things that are within the Word. What and of what quality these secret things are, will be plain in 
the following explication of each particular. [2] That a general idea may be had, it shall be briefly told what is specifically meant by "Hebrew servants" in the internal sense. In the spiritual church, 
which the sons of Israel represented, there are two kinds of men: there are those who are in the truth of faith and not in the corresponding good of life, and there are those who are in the good of 
charity and in the corresponding truth of faith. They who are in the good of charity and in the corresponding truth of faith are they who constitute the very church itself, and are men of the internal 
church. In the internal sense of the Word these are they who are called the "sons of Israel." These are of themselves free, because they are in good; for they who are led by the Lord by means of good 
are free (n. 892, 905, 2870-2893). But they who are in the truth of faith and not in the corresponding good of life are men of the external spiritual church. These are they who in the internal sense 
of the Word are meant by the "Hebrew servants." They are represented by servants because those things which are of the external church are relatively nothing else than things of service. The case is 
similar also with the truth of faith relatively to the good of charity; for the truth of faith serves for introducing the man of the church into the good of charity. [3] Be it known moreover that he 
who makes everything of the church, thus everything of salvation, to consist in the truth of faith and not in the good of charity, and who also does good from obedience only and not from the affection 
which is of the love, cannot be regenerated, as can those who are in the good of charity, that is, who do what is good from the affection of love. They can indeed be reformed, but not regenerated. Their 
reformation is here treated of in the internal sense in the laws concerning menservants and concerning maidservants. The secret things of this reformation are not at this day known to anyone, for 
the reason that an almost total ignorance prevails within the church of what the truth of faith effects toward salvation, and what the good of charity effects. Nay, it is not known what charity is, or 
that charity and faith must marry together for anything of the church to exist in man; for the marriage of good and truth is the church itself, because it is heaven in man (n. 2173, 2618, 2728, 2729, 
2803, 3132, 3155, 4434, 4823, 5194, 5502, 6179). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8974</b></p><p><b>8974.</b>
'When you buy a Hebrew slave' means those within the Church who are imbued with the truths of religious teachings and not with the good that accords with those truths. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'buying' as acquiring to oneself and making one's own, dealt with in <a href="4397.htm">4397</a>, <a href="5374.htm">5374</a>, <a href="5397.htm">5397</a>, <a href="5406.htm">5406</a>, <a href="5410.htm">5410</a>, <a href="5426.htm">5426</a>, <a href="7999.htm">7999</a>; and from the meaning of 'a Hebrew slave' as those within the Church who are imbued with 
the truths of religious teachings and not with the goodness of life that accords with those truths. For 'a slave' or 'a servant' has reference to those who are imbued with truth and not with complementary 
good, and in general to truth in relation to good, <a href="3409.htm">3409</a>. And 'Hebrew' has reference to things connected with the Church and to those connected with some servitude; for its reference to things connected 
with the Church, see <a href="5136.htm">5136</a>, <a href="5236.htm">5236</a>, <a href="6675.htm">6675</a>, <a href="6684.htm">6684</a>, and for its reference to those connected with some servitude, <a href="1703.htm">1703</a>, <a href="1741.htm">1741</a>, <a href="5013.htm">5013</a>. </p>
<p>Since the regulations that come next refer to male slaves and female 
slaves from the children of Israel, what they hold within them in the internal sense must be stated. Anyone can see that they contain the arcana of heaven, since they were declared and commanded 
by Jehovah on Mount Sinai to Moses orally, and since they follow very soon after the words of the Ten Commandments. Without such arcana they would be no more than civil and criminal laws like those of 
other nations on earth, which do not have any arcanum of heaven within them. But the arcana they contain are not evident except to angels in heaven. Consequently they do not become evident to people 
in the world except through the internal sense, because this sense teaches the way in which angels perceive the Word, and therefore teaches the arcana which the Word holds within itself. What those arcana 
are, and the nature of them, will be evident below from the explanation of specific details. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 So that a person may have a general idea of those things, a brief statement is needed to show 
what 'Hebrew slaves' in particular means in the internal sense. In the spiritual Church, which the children of Israel represented, there are two kinds of people. There are those who are imbued with the 
truth of faith but not with the complementary goodness of life, and there are those who are imbued with the good of charity and with the complementary truth of faith. Those imbued with the good of charity 
and complementary truth of faith constitute the truest part of the Church, being members of the internal Church. In the internal sense of the Word they are those called 'the children of Israel'. 
They are intrinsically free, because they are imbued with good; for those who are led by the Lord through good are free, <a href="892.htm">892</a>, <a href="905.htm">905</a>, <a href="2870.htm">2870</a>-<a href="2893.htm">2893</a>. Those however who are imbued with the truth of faith and 
not with the complementary goodness of life are members of the external spiritual Church. These are the ones who are meant in the internal sense of the Word by 'Hebrew slaves'. The reason why these people 
are represented by slaves or servants is that relatively the things which belong to the external Church are nothing other than a body of servants. The same applies also to the relationship of the 
truth of faith-to the good of charity; for the truth of faith acts like a servant to lead a member of the Church into the good of charity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In addition it should be recognized that those who think 
that the all of the Church, thus the all of salvation, consists in the truth of faith and not in the good of charity, and also those who do good solely in a spirit of obedience and not out of love 
and affection, cannot be regenerated in the way that those people are who are imbued with the good of charity, that is, who do good out of love and affection. They can, it is true, be reformed, but 
not regenerated. The reformation of them is the subject in the internal sense at this point, in the laws regarding male slaves and female slaves. The arcana of that reformation are not known to anyone 
at the present day, the reason being that almost everywhere within the Church people are ignorant of what difference the truth of faith can make to salvation, and what difference the good of charity 
can make. Indeed people are ignorant of what charity is, and also that charity and faith must be married to each other if anything of the Church is to come into being in a person; for the marriage of 
goodness and truth constitutes the Church itself, because it is heaven within a person, <a href="2173.htm">2173</a>, <a href="2618.htm">2618</a>, <a href="2728.htm">2728</a>, <a href="2729.htm">2729</a>, <a href="2803.htm">2803</a>, <a href="3132.htm">3132</a>, <a href="3155.htm">3155</a>, <a href="4434.htm">4434</a>, <a href="4823.htm">4823</a>, <a href="5194.htm">5194</a>, <a href="5502.htm">5502</a>, <a href="6179.htm">6179</a>. </p>

`Cum emeris servum Hebraeum': quod significet illos intra Ecclesiam qui in veris doctrinae et non in bono secundum illa, constat ex significatione `emere' quod sit sibi comparare et appropriare, de 
qua n. 4397, 5374, 5397, 5406, 5410, 5426, 7999, et ex significatione servi Hebraei' quod sint illi intra Ecclesiam qui in {1}veris doctrinae et non in bono vitae secundum illa sunt; `servus' enim praedicatur 
de illis qui in vero sunt et non in bono correspondente, et in genere de vero respective ad bonum, n. 3409, et `Hebraeus' de illis quae sunt Ecclesiae, et de illis quae sunt alicujus servitii; 
quod de illis quae sunt Ecclesiae, videatur n. 5136, 5236, 6675, 6684, et quod de illis quae sunt alicujus servitii, n. 1703, 1741, 5013.  Quia in nunc sequentibus agitur de servis et ancillis ex filiis 
Israelis, dicendum est quid illa in sensu interno involvunt; quisque videre potest quod in se contineant arcana caeli, quia a Jehovah {2}in monte Sinai oretenus Moschi dicta et mandata sunt, et quia 
proxime sequuntur post verba decalogi; absque {3}talibus arcanis forent {4}dumtaxat leges civiles ac forenses instar aliarum gentium in terris, {5}quibus nullum arcanum caeli inest; sed arcana quae 
continent non patent nisi angelis in caelis, proinde non hominibus nisi per sensum internum, hic enim sensus docet quomodo angeli percipiunt Verbum, proinde docet arcana quae insunt (x)Verbo; {6}quae 
et qualia arcana sunt, patebit in sequentibus ab explicatione singulorum. 	2 Ut communis idea {7} habeatur, paucis dicendum est quid in specie per `servos Hebraeos' in sensu interno intelligitur: in 
Ecclesia spirituali, quam filii Israelis (x)repraesentabant, sunt duplicis generis homines; sunt qui in vero fidei sunt et non in bono vitae correspondente, et sunt qui in bono charitatis et in vero 
fidei correspondente; qui in bono charitatis et in vero fidei correspondente, sunt qui ipsissimam Ecclesiam {8} constituunt, et sunt homines Ecclesiae internae; in Verbi sensu interno sunt hi qui vocantur 
`filii Israelis'; hi sunt ex se liberi, quia in bono sunt, nam qui per bonum a Domino ducuntur liberi sunt, n. 892, 905, 2870-2893; qui autem in vero fidei sunt et non in bono vitae correspondente, 
sunt homines Ecclesiae {9}spiritualis externae; hi sunt qui in Verbi sensu interno intelliguntur per `servos Hebraeos'; quod hi repraesententur per servos, (x)est quia illa quae externae Ecclesiae 
sunt non aliud sunt quam servitia respective; similiter etiam verum fidei respective ad bonum charitatis, nam verum fidei inservit ad introducendum hominem Ecclesiae in bonum charitatis. 	3 Praeterea 
sciendum est quod qui ponit omne Ecclesiae, ita omne salutis, in vero fidei et non in bono charitatis, {11}et quoque qui solum ex oboedientia et non ex affectione quae amoris facit bonum, non regenerari 
possit sicut illi qui in bono charitatis sunt, hoc est, qui ex affectione amoris faciunt bonum; reformari quidem possunt, sed non regenerari; de reformatione eorum agitur in sensu interno hic {12}in 
legibus de servis et de ancillis {13}; arcana reformationis istius hodie non alicui nota sunt, ex causa quia ignoratur paene ubivis intra Ecclesiam quid verum fidei facit ad salutem, et quid bonum 
charitatis, immo ignoratur quid charitas, tum quod charitas et fides inter se conjugium facient ut aliquid Ecclesiae in homine existat, nam (x)conjugium boni et veri est ipsa Ecclesia, quia est caelum 
in homine, n. 2173, 2618, 2728, 2729, 2803, 3132, 3155, 4434, (x)4823, 5194, 5502, 6179. @1 vero$ @2 e$ @3 illis$ @4 talia solum$ @5 i in$ @6 quod arcana sint$ @7 i de illis$ @8 i spiritualem$ @9
