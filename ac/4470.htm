<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4470节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4470.</strong>“我们就带着我们的女儿走了”表不会有结合。这从“婚姻”的含义清楚可知，“婚姻”是指良善与真理的结合（参看<a href="4466.htm">4466</a>节）。因此，“带着女儿走”表示不把她嫁出去，因而不会有结合。雅各的儿子们在此代表他们的父亲雅各说话，因为他们不是说“我们就带着我们的妹子”，而是说“我们的女儿”。其原因从内义明显可知，即：按照律法（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出22.15.htm">22:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出22.16.htm">16</a>），拒绝还是接受在父亲这一方。但由于此处论述的主题是雅各的后代及其宗教表象，所以他的儿子们便代表这种宗教，在此替他们的父亲回答。雅各本人没有回答，因为他在此代表古教会（参看<a href="4439.htm">4439</a>节）。</p>

We will even take our daughter and go. That this signifies that there would be no conjunction, is evident from the signification of marriage, as being the conjunction of good and truth (see above, n. 
4466). Hence "to take the daughter and go," is not to give her in marriage, thus that there would be no conjunction. The sons of Jacob here speak as Jacob their father; for they do not say, "we will 
take our sister," but "our daughter," the reason of which appears from the internal sense, namely, that it was the father's part to refuse or comply, according to the law, Exod. 22:15, 16. But as the 
posterity of Jacob and their religiosity are here treated of, it is the sons who represent this, and who therefore here answer in their father's stead. Jacob himself could not answer, because he here 
represents the Ancient Church (see n. 4439). </p>

'Then we will take our daughter and go' means that there would be no joining together. This is clear from the meaning of 'a marriage' as the joining together of good and truth, dealt with above in <a href="4466.htm">4466</a>. 
'Taking their daughter and going' therefore means not giving her in marriage, and so means that there would be no joining together. At this point Jacob's sons speak as Jacob their father, for they 
do not say 'we will take our sister' but 'our daughter'. The reason for this is evident from the internal sense, namely that it was a matter for the father either to refuse or accept, in accordance with 
the law set out in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2022:16,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 22:16, 17</a>. But because the subject here is those descended from Jacob and their semblance of religion, it is his sons, by whom that kind of religion is represented, who answer 
here in place of their father Jacob himself could not do so because here he represents the Ancient Church, <a href="4439.htm">4439</a>. </p>

`Et sumemus filiam nostram et ibimus': quod significet quod nulla conjunctio, constat ex significatione `conjugii' quod sit conjunctio (o)boni et veri, de qua supra n. 4466, inde `sumere filiam et 
ire,' est non dare illam {1} in conjugium, ita quod nulla conjunctio.  (m)Hic loquuntur filii Jacobi, sicut Jacob pater eorum, nam non dicunt sumemus `sororem' nostram sed `filiam' nostram; causa 
patet ea sensu interno, nempe quod patris esset renuere aut affirmare, secundum legem de qua Exod. xxii 15, 16 [A.V. 16, 17]; sed quia hic de posteritate ex Jacobo et ejus {2} religioso agitur, sunt 
filii ejus per quos id repraesentatur, qui loco patris hic respondent; ipse Jacob non potuit quia per illum Antiqua Ecclesia (o)hic repraesentatur, n. 4439.(n)      @1 idem est ac non dare filiam$  
    @2 eorum$ </p>
