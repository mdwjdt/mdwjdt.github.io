<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9863节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9863.</strong>“你要给它镶上镶石头”表在其适当次序中的真理本身，都源于同一种良善。这从胸牌和“镶石头”的含义清楚可知：此处“它”所指的胸牌是指从主的神性良善闪耀出来的神性真理（参看<a href="9823.htm">9823</a>节）；“镶石头”是指在其适当次序中的真理。因为胸牌照着以色列人的名字镶满宝石；“石头”在一般意义上表示在次序最低层的真理（<a href="114.htm">114</a>，<a href="643.htm">643</a>，<a href="1298.htm">1298</a>，<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>，<a href="6426.htm">6426</a>，<a href="8609.htm">8609</a>节）；“宝石”，如胸牌上的那种，表示从良善闪耀出来的真理（<a href="9476.htm">9476</a>节）。之所以说“源于同一种良善”，是因为一切真理只源于一种良善。该良善就是主里面的爱之良善，因而是主自己；所以它是来自主的爱之良善，也就是主里面的爱之良善或对主之爱的良善。因为从主流入并与世人、灵人或天使同住的良善表面上看，好像是他们的；正因如此，主里面的爱或对主之爱就是从主所获得的爱。这良善就是一切真理所源于的那独一良善，真理之间的次序也始于这良善，因为真理就是良善的外在形式。<br />胸牌中的宝石表示源于神性良善的神性真理，这一点从圣言中提到宝石的经文明显看出来，如约翰所写的启示录：<br />新耶路撒冷城墙的根基是用各样宝石修饰的。第一根基是碧玉，第二是蓝宝石，第三是绿玛瑙，第四是绿宝石，第五是红玛瑙，第六是红宝石，第七是橄榄石，第八是绿柱石，第九是黄玉，第十是绿玉，第十一是紫玛瑙，第十二是紫晶。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.19.htm">21:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.20.htm">20</a>）<br />这些宝石表示教会的真理，就是神之真理，这一点从“新耶路撒冷城”、“城墙”和“城墙的根基”的含义明显看出来：“新耶路撒冷城”表示将要取代我们当今教会的新教会；因为启示录论述了现在教会的状态，甚至直到它的结局；然后论述了一个新教会，就是从天而降的圣耶路撒冷；“城墙”表示扞卫它的信之真理；“城墙的根基”表示源于良善的真理。那里按名所提到的宝石标明了在其适当次序中的这些真理本身。谁能看出，耶路撒冷不会从天而降，关于它所说的其它事也不会照字面上所描述的那样发生；相反，这段描述在每个细节上都表示诸如与教会有关的那类事物。“城墙的根基”表示信之真理，这一点从以下事实明显可知：这些真理是保卫教会免受一切攻击的，如同城墙保卫一座城那样。“耶路撒冷”是指教会（参看<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="9166.htm">9166</a>节）；“城墙”是指保卫教会的信之真理（<a href="6419.htm">6419</a>节）；“根基”是指源于良善的真理（<a href="9643.htm">9643</a>节）。<br />以西结书：<br />人子啊，你为推罗王作起哀歌，对他说，主耶和华如此说：你智慧充足，全然美丽。你曾在伊甸神的园中，佩戴各样宝石，就是红宝石、红璧玺、金钢石、水苍玉、红玛瑙、碧玉、蓝宝石、绿宝石、红玉和黄金。你在神的圣山上，行走火石中间。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.12.htm">28:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.14.htm">14</a>）<br />此处“宝石”也表示源于良善的真理；因为就内在代表意义而言，“推罗”是指一个拥有由关于良善和真理的认知或知识所生的聪明和智慧的人（<a href="1201.htm">1201</a>节）。这就是为何经上论到它的王说：他“智慧充足，全然美丽”；“智慧”论及良善，“美丽”论及真理；因为天上的一切智慧皆来自良善，一切美丽皆来自源于良善的真理。“伊甸园”表示由良善构成的聪明（<a href="100.htm">100</a>节），“园”表示聪明本身（<a href="100.htm">100</a>，<a href="108.htm">108</a>，<a href="2702.htm">2702</a>节）。由此明显可知那里按名所提到的“石头”表示源于良善的真理。<br />从下文可以清楚看出，胸牌上的每样宝石究竟表示哪些源于良善的真理。它们表示整体上一切真理和良善，这一点从以下事实明显看出来：宝石有十二种，它们上面刻着以色列人，也就是各支派的名字；因为“十二支派”表示整体上天堂和教会的良善和真理（<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="3926.htm">3926</a>，<a href="3939.htm">3939</a>，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>，<a href="6335.htm">6335</a>，<a href="6337.htm">6337</a>，<a href="6397.htm">6397</a>节）；由此表示天使和那里的一切社群（<a href="7836.htm">7836</a>，<a href="7891.htm">7891</a>，<a href="7996.htm">7996</a>，<a href="7997.htm">7997</a>节）；十二支派的含义照着圣言中提及它们的顺序而各不相同（<a href="3862.htm">3862</a>，<a href="3926.htm">3926</a>，<a href="3939.htm">3939</a>，<a href="4603.htm">4603</a>，<a href="6337.htm">6337</a>，<a href="6640.htm">6640</a>节）；“十二”表示全部或一切（<a href="3272.htm">3272</a>，<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="7973.htm">7973</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9863</b></p><p><b>9863.</b>
And thou shalt fill it with a filling of stone. That this signifies the truths themselves in their order from one good, is evident from the signification of "the breastplate," which is what was to be 
filled, as being Divine truth shining forth from the Divine good of the Lord (see n. 9823); and from the signification of "a filling of stone," as being truths in their order; for the breastplate was 
filled with stones according to the names of the sons of Israel; and by "stones" in a general sense are signified truths in the ultimate of order (n. 114, 643, 1298, 3720, 6426, 8609); and by "precious 
stones," such as were in the breastplate, are signified truths shining from good (n. 9476). It is said "from one good," because there is one good from which are all truths. This good is the good of 
love within the Lord, thus the Lord Himself; and consequently it is the good of love from the Lord, which is the good of love within the Lord; for the good which flows in from the Lord into man, spirit, 
or angel, appears as if it were theirs; consequently love within the Lord is love from the Lord. This good is the one only good from which are all truths, and from which is the order among truths, 
for truths are forms of good. [2] That the precious stones which were in the breastplate signified Divine truths from Divine good, is evident from the passages in the Word where precious stones are 
mentioned; as with John in Revelation: </p>
<p>     The foundations of the wall of the city New Jerusalem were adorned with every precious stone. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, 
chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, 
amethyst (Rev. 21:19, 20). That these precious stones signify the truths of the church, which are truths Divine, is evident from the signification of "the city New Jerusalem," of its "wall," and "the 
foundations of the wall." "The New Jerusalem" signifies the New Church which will succeed our present church; for the book of Revelation treats of the state of the church as it is now, even to its end; 
and then of the New Church, which is the holy Jerusalem coming down out of heaven; its "walls" denote the truths of faith which defend; and its "foundations" denote truths from good; these truths 
themselves in their order are designated by the precious stones there named. Everyone can see that Jerusalem is not to come down out of heaven, and that the rest of what is said about it will not happen 
as described; but that in each particular of the description such things are signified as pertain to the church. That the truths of faith are meant by "the foundations of its wall," is evident from 
the fact that these truths are what protect the church from every attack, even as walls protect a city. (That "Jerusalem" denotes the church, see n. 2117, 9166; and that "walls" denote the truths of 
faith that protect the church, n. 6419; and that "foundations" denote truths from good, n. 9643.) [3] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyre, and say to him, Thus said 
the Lord Jehovih, Thou art full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the ruby, the topaz, and the diamond, the tarshish 
[beryl], the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the chrysoprase, and the carbuncle, and gold. Thou hast been in the mountain of holiness of God; thou hast walked in the midst of the stones of fire 
(Ezek. 28:12-14). Here also by "the precious stones" are signified truths from good; for in the internal representative sense "Tyre" denotes one who is in intelligence and wisdom from the knowledges 
of good and truth (n. 1201) therefore it is said of its king that he is "full of wisdom and perfect in beauty," "wisdom" being predicated of good, and "beauty" of truth; for all the wisdom in the heavens 
is from good, and all the beauty there is from the truths thence derived. "Eden the garden" signifies intelligence from good (n. 100); "the garden," intelligence itself (n. 100, 108, 2702). From this 
it is evident that by the "stones" there mentioned are signified truths from good.  [4] But what truths from good are signified by each of the stones in the breastplate, will be seen from what follows. 
That all truths and goods in the complex are signified, is evident from the fact that there were twelve stones, and that on them were inscribed the names of the sons of Israel, that is, of the 
tribes; for by "the twelve tribes" are signified the goods and truths of heaven and of the church in the whole complex (n. 3858, 3926, 3939, 4060, 6335, 6337, 6397); and that from this they signified 
heaven with all the societies there (n. 7836, 7891, 7996, 7997); also that they signified various things according to the order in which they are mentioned in the Word (n. 3862, 3926, 3939, 4603, 6337, 
6640); and that "twelve" denotes all things (n. 3272, 3858, 7973). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9863</b></p><p><b>9863.</b>
'And you shall adorn it with settings of stones' means the actual truths in their proper order, all springing from the one same good. This is clear from the meaning of the breastplate, to which 'it' 
refers here, as Divine Truth shining forth from the Lord's Divine Good, dealt with in <a href="9823.htm">9823</a>; from the meaning of 'settings of stones' as truths in their proper order. For the breastplate was adorned with 
stones in accord with the names of the sons of Israel, and in a general sense truths on the lowest level of order are meant by 'stones', <a href="114.htm">114</a>, <a href="643.htm">643</a>, <a href="1298.htm">1298</a>, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>, <a href="6426.htm">6426</a>, <a href="8609.htm">8609</a>, and truths shining forth from 
good by 'precious stones' such as those in the breastplate, <a href="9476.htm">9476</a>. The expression 'springing from the one same good' is used because there is just one good that all the truths spring from. This good 
is the good of love within the Lord, thus is the Lord Himself, and is consequently the good of love from the Lord, which is the good of love to the Lord. For the good which flows in from the Lord and 
resides with man, spirit, or angel, has all the appearance of being theirs; and so it is that love to the Lord is love received from the Lord. This good is the one and only good from which all the truths 
spring, and from which the order among them begins; for the truths are outward forms of the good.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that the precious stones in the breastplate meant Divine Truths springing from 
Divine Good is clear from places in the Word where precious stones are mentioned, such as in John's Revelation,  </p>
<blockquote>
The foundations of the wall of the city, the new Jerusalem, were adorned with every 
kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, 
the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2021:19,%2020&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 21:19, 20</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>These precious stones mean the Church's truths, which are God's truths. This is clear from the 
meaning of 'the city, the new Jerusalem', 'the wall of it', and 'the foundations of the wall'. 'The new Jerusalem' means a new Church which will take the place of the one that is ours at the present day; 
for the Book of Revelation deals with the state of the Church that exists now, through to its end, and then with a new Church, which is the holy Jerusalem coming down out of heaven. 'The wall of it' 
means the truths of faith that serve to defend it, and 'the foundations' truths that spring from good. Those actual truths in their proper order are specified by the precious stones mentioned by name 
there. Anyone may see that no Jerusalem is going to come down out of heaven or that anything else mentioned there is literally going to take place, but that this description in every detail means such 
things as have to do with the Church. The fact that the truths of faith are meant by the foundations of its wall is clear from the consideration that they are the things which guard the Church from 
every attack, as walls do a city.  </p>
<p>'Jerusalem' is the Church, see <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>, <a href="9166.htm">9166</a>.  'Walls' are the truths of faith guarding the Church, <a href="6419.htm">6419</a>.  'Foundations' are truths springing from good, <a href="9643.htm">9643</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
In Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
Son of man, take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre, and say to him, Thus said the Lord Jehovih, Full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty, you were in Eden, the garden of God. Every 
precious stone was your covering - ruby, topaz, and diamond; tarshish, shoham, and jasper; sapphire, chrysoprase, and carbuncle - and gold. You were on the mountain of the holiness of God, you walked 
in the midst of stones of fire. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2028:12-14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 28:12-14</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here also precious stones mean truths springing from good. For 'Tyre' in the representative internal sense is one who has intelligence and wisdom 
arising from cognitions or knowledge of goodness and truth, <a href="1201.htm">1201</a>. This is why its king is said to be 'full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty'. 'Wisdom' has regard to good, and 'beauty' to truth; for 
all wisdom in heaven is derived from good, and all beauty there is derived from truths springing from good. 'The garden of Eden' means intelligence composed of good, <a href="100.htm">100</a>, 'garden' meaning real intelligence, <a href="100.htm">100</a>, <a href="108.htm">108</a>, <a href="2702.htm">2702</a>. From this it is evident that the stones there mentioned by name mean truths springing from good.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 But precisely which truths springing from good are meant by each of the 
stones in the breastplate will be clear from what is to follow. The fact that they mean all truths and forms of good in their entirety is clear from the following considerations: They were twelve and 
had the names of the sons of Israel or the tribes inscribed on them, the forms of good and the truths of heaven and the Church in their entirety being meant by the twelve tribes, <a href="3858.htm">3858</a>, <a href="3926.htm">3926</a>, <a href="3939.htm">3939</a>, <a href="4060.htm">4060</a>, 
<a href="6335.htm">6335</a>, <a href="6337.htm">6337</a>, <a href="6397.htm">6397</a>; they therefore meant heaven and all the communities there, <a href="7836.htm">7836</a>, <a href="7891.htm">7891</a>, <a href="7996.htm">7996</a>, <a href="7997.htm">7997</a>; the meaning of them varied, depending on the order in which they are mentioned in the Word, <a href="3862.htm">3862</a>, 
<a href="3926.htm">3926</a>, <a href="3939.htm">3939</a>, <a href="4303.htm">4303</a>, <a href="6337.htm">6337</a>, <a href="6640.htm">6640</a>; and 'twelve' means all, <a href="3272.htm">3272</a>, <a href="3858.htm">3858</a>, <a href="7973.htm">7973</a>.  </p>

`Et opplebis illud oppletura lapidis': quod significet ipsa vera in suo ordine ex uno bono, constat ex significatione `pectoralis,' quod hic est `illud,' quod sit Divinum Verum elucens ex Divino Bono 
Domini, de qua n. 9823; ex significatione `oppleturae lapidis' quod sint vera in suo ordine, nam pectorale opplebatur lapidibus secundum nomina filiorum Israelis, et per `lapides' in communi sensu significantur 
vera in ultimo ordinis, n. 114, 643, 1298, 3720, 6426, 8609, et per `lapides pretiosos,' quales in pectorali, vera ex bono elucentia, n. 9476.  Dicitur ex uno bono, quia est unum bonum ex 
quo omnia vera; bonum illud est bonum amoris in Domino, ita Ipse Dominus, et inde bonum amoris a Domino, quod est bonum amoris in Dominum; nam bonum quod a Domino influit apud hominem, spiritum, aut 
angelum, apparet sicut illorum, inde amor in Dominum est amor a Domino; hoc bonum est unicum ex quo omnia vera, et ex quo ordo inter illa, nam vera sunt formae boni. 	[2] Quod lapides pretiosi qui in 
pectorali, significaverint Divina Vera ex Divino Bono, constat ex locis in Verbo ubi lapides pretiosi nominantur, ut apud Johannem in Apocalypsi, 	Fundamenta muri {1}civitatis novae Hierosolymae omni 
lapide  pretioso exornata erant; fundamentum primum jaspis, (x)secundum sapphirus, tertium chalcedonius, quartum smaragdus, quintum sardonyx, sextum sardius, septimum (x)chrysolithus, octavum beryllus, 
nonum topazius, decimum chrysoprasus, undecimum hyacinthus, duodecimum amethystus, xxi 19, 20; </p>
<p>quod lapides illi pretiosi significent vera Ecclesiae, quae sunt vera Divina, constat ex significatione 
`{1}civitatis' novae Hierosolymae,' `muri ejus,' et `fundamentorum {2}muri'; `nova Hierosolyma' significat novam Ecclesiam huic nostrae successuram; nam Liber Apocalypseos agit de statu Ecclesiae 
quae nunc, usque ad ejus finem, et tunc de nova, quae est sancta Hierosolyma descendens e caelo; `muri ejus' sunt vera fidei quae defendunt, et `fundamenta' sunt vera ex bono; ipsa illa vera in suo ordine 
designantur per lapides pretiosos ibi nominatos; quod  Hierosolyma non descensura sit e caelo, et quod reliqua quae de illa dicuntur, non ita exstitura, sed quod in singulis ejus descriptionis talia 
quae sunt Ecclesiae, significentur, {3}quisque videre potest; {4}quod vera fidei per fundamenta muri ejus intelligantur, constat ex eo quod illa sint quae tutantur Ecclesiam ab omni insultu, sicut 
muri urbem; (m)quod `Hierosolyma' sit Ecclesia, videatur n. 2117, 9166, quod `muri' sint vera fidei {5}tutantia Ecclesiam, n. 6419, et quod `fundamenta' sint vera ex bono, n. 9643:(n) [3] apud Ezechielem, 	Fili

<p>hic
