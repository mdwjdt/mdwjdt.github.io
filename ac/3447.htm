<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3447节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3447.</strong>“亚比米勒从基拉耳来见以撒”表关注理性事物的信之教义。这从“亚比米勒”的代表和“基拉耳”的含义清楚可知：“亚比米勒”是指关注理性事物的信之教义（<a href="2504.htm">2504</a>，<a href="2509.htm">2509</a>，<a href="2510.htm">2510</a>，<a href="3391.htm">3391</a>，<a href="3393.htm">3393</a>，<a href="3398.htm">3398</a>节）；“基拉耳”是指信（<a href="1209.htm">1209</a>，<a href="2504.htm">2504</a>，<a href="3365.htm">3365</a>，<a href="3384.htm">3384</a>，<a href="3385.htm">3385</a>节）。至于何为关注理性事物的教义，可参看前文（<a href="3368.htm">3368</a>节）。从此处直到33节，所论述的主题与那些处于圣言的字义，并由此处于信之教义事物的人有关，也与他们的教义事物（只要它们取自字义）与内义的一致有关。亚比米勒和他的同伴亚户撒、他的军长非各就代表这些教义事物，他们就是那些视信为本质，尽管不拒绝仁，却将它列在信之下，从而将教义置于生活之上的人。如今我们的教会几乎都是这个样，除了基督教的外邦人（Christian Gentilism）所存在的东西外，在那里，人们被允许朝拜圣徒及其圣像。<br />主的每个教会都有内在的人和外在的人，内在的人是指那些具有对良善的情感之人，而外在的人是指那些具有对真理的情感之人。此处由亚比米勒和他的同伴、军长所代表那些人也是如此。前面（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创21.22.htm">21:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创21.33.htm">33</a>）论述了那些内在的人，在那里，经上论到亚比米勒和他的军长非各说，他们来到亚伯拉罕这里，与他在别是巴立了约（<a href="2719.htm">2719</a>-<a href="2720.htm">2720</a>节）。但此处论述的是那些外在的人。</p>

And Abimelech went to him from Gerar. That this signifies the doctrine of faith that looks to rational things, is evident from the representation of Abimelech, as being the doctrine of faith that looks 
to rational things (n. 2504, 2509, 2510, 3391, 3393, 3397); and from the signification of "Gerar," as being faith (n. 1209, 2504, 3365, 3384, 3385); what the doctrine is that looks to rational things, 
may be seen above (n. 3368). In this passage, and as far as verse 33, they are treated of who are in the literal sense of the Word and from this in the doctrinal things of faith; and also the agreement 
of their doctrinal things with the internal sense insofar as they are from the literal sense. Abimelech and Ahuzzath his companion, and Phicol the chief captain of his army, represent these doctrinal 
things; they are such as make faith the essential, not indeed rejecting charity, but making it secondary, and thus setting doctrine before life. Our churches at this day are almost all of this character, 
except that which is in Christian Gentilism, where it is permitted to adore saints and their idols. [2] As in every church of the Lord there are those who are internal men and those who are 
external, and the internal are those who are in the affection of good, and the external those who are in the affection of truth; so also with those who are here represented by Abimelech, his companion, 
and the chief captain of his army-the internal are those treated of above (chapter 21, verses 22 to 33), where it is said of Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his army that they came to Abraham and 
made a covenant with him in Beersheba (n. 2719-2720); but the external are those here treated of. </p>

'Abimelech went to him from Gerar' means the doctrine of faith which has regard to rational concepts. This is clear from the representation of 'Abimelech' as the doctrine of faith which has regard to 
rational concepts, dealt with in <a href="2504.htm">2504</a>, <a href="2509.htm">2509</a>, <a href="2510.htm">2510</a>, <a href="3391.htm">3391</a>, <a href="3393.htm">3393</a>, <a href="3398.htm">3398</a>, and from the meaning of 'Gerar' as faith, dealt with in <a href="1209.htm">1209</a>, <a href="2504.htm">2504</a>, <a href="3365.htm">3365</a>, <a href="3384.htm">3384</a>, <a href="3385.htm">3385</a>. For what doctrine having regard to rational 
concepts is, see <a href="3368.htm">3368</a>. From here to verse 33 the subject has to do with those among whom the literal sense of the Word and from this matters of doctrine concerning faith exist, and with the agreement 
of those matters of doctrine, insofar as they are drawn from the literal sense, with the internal sense; for 'Abimelech, and Ahuzzath his companion, and Phicol the commander of his army' represent those 
matters of doctrine. They are those who make faith the essential thing, and who, though they do not reject charity, rank it below faith, and so rate doctrine above life. Almost all our Churches today 
are like this, with the exception of that which exists in Christian Gentilism where people are allowed to venerate saints and images of them. </p>

 As within every Church that is the Lord's some people 
are internal and others are external - the internal being those whose affection is for good, the external those whose affection is for truth - so it is also with those who are represented here by 
Abimelech, his companion, and the commander of his army. Those who are internal have been dealt with already in Chapter 21:22-33, where it is said of Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army that 
they came to Abraham and made a covenant with him in Beersheba, see <a href="2719.htm">2719</a>, <a href="2720.htm">2720</a>. But those who are external are dealt with here. </p>

`Abimelech ivit ad illum e Gerar': quod significet doctrinam fidei spectantem rationalia, constat ex repraesentatione `Abimelechi' quod sit doctrina fidei spectans rationalia, de qua n. 2504, 2509, 
2510, 3391, (x)3393, 3398; et a significatione `Geraris' quod sit fides, de qua n. 1209, 2504, 3365, 3384, 3385; quid doctrina spectans rationalia, videatur n. 3368. Agitur hic et usque ad vers. 33 de 
illis qui in sensu litterali Verbi sunt, et inde in doctrinalibus fidei, ac de doctrinalium horum quatenus ex sensu litterali sunt, concordantia cum sensu interno; `Abimelech {1}et Ahuzzath socius illius, 
ac Phicol dux exercitus illius' illa repraesentant; sunt illi qui fidem faciunt essentialem, et charitatem quidem non rejiciunt, sed postponunt, ita doctrinam praeferunt vitae; nostrae Ecclesiae 
hodie paene omnes tales sunt, praeter illam quae est in gentilismo Christiano, ubi per mittitur adorare sanctos et eorum idola. [2] Sicut in omni Ecclesia Domini sunt qui interni homines sunt, et qui 
externi; ac interni sunt qui in affectione boni, {2}et externi qui in affectione veri; ita quoque hi qui per `Abimelechum, ejus socium (c)et ducem exercitus' hic repraesentantur; interni sunt, de quibus 
prius cap. xxi vers. 22-33 actum est, ubi de Abimelecho et Phicole duce exercitus ejus, quod ad Abrahamum venerint, et pepigerint cum illo foedus in Beersheba, de quibus videatur n. 2719, 2720; externi 
autem sunt, de quibus hic agitur. @1 i enim$  @2 at$  </p>
