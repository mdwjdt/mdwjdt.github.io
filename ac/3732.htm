<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3732节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3732.</strong>“雅各立下一个誓言，说”表天命的状态（state of Providence）。 这从“立下一个誓言”的含义清楚可知，“立下一个誓言”在内义上是指意愿主会给予，因而在论述主的至高意义上是指天命的状态。就内义而言，“立下一个誓言”表示意愿主会给予。这是因为誓言里面有一种渴望和情感，即所意愿的事或许会发生，因而主会给予。誓言还含有某种交易的意味，同时含有人这一方的某种应尽责任或义务的意味，只要达成他所愿。这就是雅各的情形，因为如果耶和华在路上保佑他，给他食物吃、衣服穿，使他平平安安地回到他父亲的家，耶和华就作他的神，他立为柱子的石头就作神的殿，他要将耶和华所赐给他的十分之一献出来。由此明显可知，在那个年代，誓言是特殊约定，涉及倘若神满足了人们的愿望，人们就承认神为他们的神，还涉及倘若神给予了，他们就会以某种礼物回报祂。<br />所有这一切清楚表明犹太民族的列祖是何性质。他们就像此处的雅各，直到目前，雅各仍不承认耶和华，还停留在是承认祂还是承认别神为他的神的选择阶段。这个民族，甚至他们的列祖有一个特点，即每个人都渴望拥有他自己的神，即便有人敬拜耶和华，他也只是敬拜名叫耶和华的某个神，这个名字不过是将祂与其它民族的神区分开而已。因此，在这方面，他们的敬拜甚至就是偶像崇拜。因为只敬拜名字，哪怕是耶和华的名，无非就是偶像崇拜（<a href="1094.htm">1094</a>节）。那些自称基督徒，声明敬拜基督，却不照祂的诫命生活的人也一样。他们以偶像崇拜的方式敬拜祂，因为他们只敬拜祂的名，而他们所敬拜的，却是假基督；关于这假基督，可参看马太福音24:23，24（<a href="3010.htm">3010</a>节）。</p>

And Jacob vowed a vow. That this signifies a state of Providence, is evident from the signification of "vowing a vow," as being in the internal sense to will that the Lord shall provide, and therefore 
in the supreme sense, in which the Lord is treated of, a state of Providence. That in the internal sense "to vow a vow" signifies to will that the Lord shall provide, is from the fact that in vows there 
is the desire and affection that what is willed may come to pass; thus that the Lord shall provide. There is also implied somewhat of stipulation, and at the same time somewhat of obligation on the 
part of man, which he takes upon himself if he comes to possess the object of his wish; as here on the part of Jacob, that Jehovah should be to him for a God, and the stone which he set up for a pillar 
should be the house of God, and that he would tithe all that was given him, provided that Jehovah would keep him in the way, and would give him bread to eat and raiment to put on, and that he should 
return in peace to his father's house. This shows that in those days vows were special compacts, especially as regards the acknowledging of God as being their God if He would provide for them what 
they desired, and as regards the repaying of Him by some gift if He would so provide.  [2] From all this it is very evident what was the quality of the fathers of the Jewish nation, as here that of 
Jacob, who as yet did not acknowledge Jehovah, and was still undetermined in his choice as to whether he should acknowledge Him or another for his God. It was a peculiarity of that nation, even from the 
time of their fathers, that everyone desired to have his own God, and that if anyone worshiped Jehovah, it was only that he worshiped some god called Jehovah, and who by this name was distinguished 
from the gods of other nations, so that their worship even in this respect was idolatrous; for the worship of a mere name, even of the name Jehovah, is nothing but idolatry (n. 1094). The case is the 
same with those who call themselves Christians and say they worship Christ, but do not live according to His precepts; such worship Him with idolatry, because they worship His name alone, since it is 
a false Christ whom they worship; concerning which false Christ see Matthew 24:23, 24 (n. 3010). </p>

'Jacob made a vow, saying' means a state of Providence. This is clear from the meaning of 'making a vow' in the internal sense as wishing the Lord to provide; and therefore in the highest sense, in which 
the Lord is the subject, a state of Providence is meant. The reason why in the internal sense 'making a vow' means wishing the Lord to provide is that present within vows there is a desire and affection 
that what is wished for may come about, thus that the Lord may provide it. Within them something of a bargain is present, and at the same time on man's part something of a bounden duty to keep 
his side of it, should he obtain his desire. This was the case with Jacob, in that Jehovah was to be his God, and the stone which he placed as a pillar was to be God's house, and he would devote a tenth 
of everything He had given him, if Jehovah guarded him on the road, gave him bread to eat and clothing to wear, and he went back in peace to his father's house. From this it is evident that the vows 
made in those times were particular agreements, involving primarily men's acknowledgement of God as their God if He provided them with what they desired, and involving also their repayment to Him with 
some gift if He did provide it. </p>

 That state of affairs shows quite clearly what the fathers of the Jewish nation were like. They were like Jacob here, who did not as yet acknowledge Jehovah 
and was still at the stage of choosing whether to acknowledge Him or some other as his own God. It was a special feature of that nation, even of their fathers, that everyone wished to have his own God; 
and anyone who worshipped Jehovah worshipped Him merely as some god called Jehovah, the name which distinguished Him from the gods of other nations. Accordingly their worship even in this respect was 
idolatrous, for the worship of the name only, even of Jehovah's, is nothing but idolatrous, <a href="1094.htm">1094</a>. This is like people who call themselves Christians and say that they worship Christ, but do not live 
according to His commandments. They worship Him in an idolatrous way since they worship only His name, it being a false Christ whom they worship; reference to that false Christ is made in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matthew%2024:%2023,%2024%20-&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matthew 24: 23, 24 -</a> see <a href="3010.htm">3010</a>. </p>

`Vovit Jacobus votum':  quod significet Providentiae statum, constat a significatione `vovere votum' quod in sensu interno sit velle ut Dominus provideat, inde in sensu supremo, in quo agitur de 
Domino, est providentiae status. Quod `vovere votum' sit in sensu interno velle ut Dominus provideat, est ex eo quia votis inest desiderium et affectio ut fiat quod volunt, ita ut provideat Dominus; 
est aliquid constipulationis, et simul aliquid debiti a parte hominis quod sibi suscepit, si optato potiretur, ut hic a Jacobo quod Jehovah esset illi in Deum, et lapis quem posuit statuam, esset 
Domus Dei, et quod decimaret omne quod dederit illi, si Jehovah custodiverit illum in via, et dederit illi panem ad edendum, et vestem ad induendum, ac redierit in pace ad domum patris Sui; inde patet 
quod vota tunc temporis fuerint singularia pacta, imprimis ad agnoscendum Deum pro suo Deo, si provideret illis quae desiderabant, {1}et quoque quod rependerent Ipsi per aliquod munus si provideret. 
[2] Ex his manifeste patet quales fuerunt patres gentis Judaicae, sicut hic Jacob, quod nondum agnoverit Jehovam, et quod adhuc in electione fuerit, num Illum aut alium pro suo Deo agnosceret; 
hoc singulare fuit in gente illa, usque a patribus eorum, quod quisque suum Deum habere vellet, et qui Jehovam colebat, esset modo quod aliquem deum qui Jehovah appellaretur, et per hoc nomen distinctus 
esset a diis aliarum gentium, ita quod cultus eorum, etiam in hoc, idololatricus fuerit, nam cultus solius nominis, etiamsi Jehovae, non est nisi idololatricus, n. (x)1094: sicut qui se Christianos 
vocant, et dicunt se colere Christum et non vivunt secundum praecepta Ipsius; </p>
<p>illi Ipsum idololatrice colunt quia solum Ipsius nomen, est enim falsus Christus quem colunt, de quo apud Matthaeum 
xxiv 23, 24; n. 3010. @1 at$ </p>
