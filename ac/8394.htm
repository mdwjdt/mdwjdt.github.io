<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8394.</strong>一个人在检查自己，承认自己的罪，并切实悔改之后，就必须始终坚定地保持在良善中，直到生命结束。然而，他以后若回到以前的罪恶生活，重新接受它，就会亵渎那良善，因为这时，他将邪恶与良善结合在一起。结果，他后来的状态比先前的更糟糕，正如主所说的：<br />污灵从人里面出来，走遍干旱之地，寻求安歇，却寻不着。于是说，我要回到我所出来的屋里去。到了，就看见里面空闲，打扫干净，修饰好了，便去另带了七个比自己更恶的灵来，都进去住在那里。那人末后的景况比先前更不好了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.43.htm">12:43</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.45.htm">45</a>）</p>

After a man has examined himself, and has acknowledged his sins, and has done repentance, he must remain constant in good up to the end of life. If however he afterward falls back into his former life 
of evil, and embraces it, he commits profanation, for he then conjoins evil with good, and consequently his latter state becomes worse than his former one, according to the Lord's words: </p>
<p>     When 
the unclean spirit goeth out of a man he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, but findeth none; then he saith, I will return into my house whence I came out; and when he is come, and findeth it empty, 
and swept, and garnished for him, then goeth he, and joineth to himself seven other spirits worse than himself, and having entered in they dwell there; and the last things of the man become worse 
than the first (Matt. 12:43-45).            EXODUS 16 </p>
<p>     1. And they journeyed from Elim, and all the assemblage of the sons of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and 
Sinai, in the fifteenth day of the second month of their going out of the land of Egypt.      2. And all the assemblage of the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness.  
    3. And the sons of Israel said unto them, Oh that we had died by the hand of Jehovah in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh-pot, when we did eat bread to satiety! for ye have brought 
us forth unto this wilderness, to kill this whole congregation with hunger.      4. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Behold I am making it rain bread for you from heaven, and the people shall go out, 
and they shall gather the word of a day in its day, in order that I may try them, whether they will walk in My law, or not.      5. And it shall be in the sixth day, that they shall prepare that which 
they have brought, and there shall be double over what they shall gather day by day.      6. And Moses and Aaron said unto all the sons of Israel, In the evening, then ye shall know that Jehovah hath 
brought you out from the land of Egypt.      7. And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of Jehovah, in that He heareth your murmurings against Jehovah; and what are we, that ye murmur against 
us?      8. And Moses said, In that Jehovah shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to satiety; in that Jehovah heareth your murmurings with which ye murmur against Him: 
what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against Jehovah.      9. And Moses said unto Aaron, Say unto all the assemblage of the sons of Israel, Come ye near before Jehovah, for He hath 
heard your murmurings.      10. And it was, as Aaron spake unto the whole assemblage of the sons of Israel, that they looked back unto the wilderness, and behold the glory of Jehovah was seen in the 
cloud.      11. And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,       12. I have heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel; speak unto them, saying, Between the evenings ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning 
ye shall be sated with bread; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God.      13. And it was in the evening that the quail came up, and covered the camp; and in the morning there was a deposit 
of dew round about the camp.      14. And the deposit of dew went up, and behold upon the faces of the wilderness a small round thing, small as the hoar frost upon the earth.      15. And the sons 
of Israel saw, and they said a man to his brother, What is this [Man hoc]? for they knew not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which Jehovah hath given you to eat.      16. This 
is the word that Jehovah hath commanded, Gather ye of it everyone according to the mouth of his eating, an omer a head, according to the number of your souls, take ye everyone for him who is in his 
tent.      17. And the sons of Israel did so, and they gathered, collecting for the numerous and the few.      18. And they measured it with the omer, and it made nothing over for the numerous; and 
for the few there was no lack; they gathered everyone according to his eating.      19. And Moses said unto them, Let no one make a residue of it till the morning.      20. And they heard not unto Moses; 
and men made a residue of it until the morning, and it bred worms and stank, and Moses was angry with them.      21. And they gathered it morning by morning, everyone according to the mouth of 
his eating; and the sun grew hot, and it melted.      22. And it was that on the sixth day they gathered bread double, two omers for each one; and all the princes of the assemblage came and told Moses.  
    23. And he said unto them, This is what Jehovah spake, A rest, a Sabbath holy to Jehovah, is the morrow; what ye will bake, bake ye; and what ye will boil, boil ye; and all that is left over, 
this lay ye by for you to keep until the morning.      24. And they laid it by till the morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink, and the worm was not in it.      25. And Moses said, Eat ye 
this today, because today is a Sabbath to Jehovah, today ye shall not find it in the field.      26. Six days ye shall gather it, and on the seventh day is the Sabbath, it shall not be in it.     
 27. And it was on the seventh day there went out some of the people for to gather, and they found none.      28. And Jehovah said unto Moses, How long do ye refuse to keep My commandments and My laws?  
    29. See ye, because Jehovah hath given you the Sabbath, therefore He giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; rest ye everyone in his place, let no one go forth from his place on the 
seventh day.      30. And the people rested on the seventh day.      31. And the house of Israel called the name of it Manna; and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like that 
of a cake in honey.      32. And Moses said, This is the word which Jehovah hath commanded, Fill an omer with it to be kept for your generations, to the end that they may see the bread wherewith I 
fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.      33. And Moses said unto Aaron, Take an urn, and put the omerful of manna therein, and lay it up before Jehovah, to be 
kept for your generations.      34. As Jehovah commanded Moses, and Aaron laid it up before the Testimony to be kept.      35. And the sons of Israel did eat the manna forty years, until they came 
to a land inhabited; they did eat the manna until they came unto the border of the land of Canaan.      36. And an omer is the tenth part of an ephah. </p>

Having examined himself, acknowledged his sins, and repented a person must remain steadfast in good to life's end. But if having done those things he falls back into his former life of evil and embraces 
it he profanes that good since he now links evil with it. As a consequence his latter state becomes, according to the Lord's words, worse than his former, </p>
<blockquote>
When the unclean spirit goes out of a 
person he goes through dry places seeking rest, but does not find it. Then he says, I will return into my house from which I came out; and when he comes and finds it empty, swept, and decorated for him, 
he goes away and links to himself seven other spirits more evil than himself; and they enter and dwell there. And the latter [circumstances] of the person become worse than the first. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2012:43-45&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 12:43-45</a>.

<p><LI value='4'> And Jehovah said to Moses, behold, I am causing it to rain bread from heaven for you; and the people will go out and gather the thing of a day in its day,<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> in order

<p><LI value='8'> And Moses said, Jehovah is giving you flesh to eat in the evening, and in the morning bread 
to the full; Jehovah hears your grumblings which you make against Him. What are we? Your grumblings are not against us, but against Jehovah. </p>
<p><LI value='9'> And Moses said to Aaron, Say to all the assembly of

<p><LI value='10'> And so it was, as Aaron was speaking to all the assembly of the children of Israel, that they looked back towards

<p><LI value='17'> And the children of Israel did so, and gathered it, [each] collecting it for a large number or for a few. </p>
<p><LI value='18'> And they measured it with an omer, and

<p><LI value='21'> And they gathered it 
morning by morning, each according to the mouth of his eating; and the sun grew hot, and it melted. </p>

<p><LI value='24'> And they put it aside till the morning, as Moses commanded; and it did not become

Postquam homo se exploraverat, et agnoverat sua peccata, et paenitentiam egerat, manebit constans in bono usque ad finem vitae; si autem dein relabitur ad vitam mali priorem et hanc amplectitur, tunc 
profanat, nam tunc malum conjungit bono; inde status ejus posterior (t)fit pejor priore, secundum Domini verba, Quando immundus spiritus exit ex homine, perambulat arentia loca quaerens requiem, sed 
non invenit; tunc dicit, Revertar in domum meam unde exivi; cumque venit, et reperit illam vacuam, et scopis purgatam, et ornatam sibi, tunc abit et adjungit sibi septem alios spiritus pejores se, et 
ingressi habitant ibi; et fiunt posteriora hominis pejora primis, Matth. xii 43-45. CAPUT XVI 	1.  Et profecti sunt ex Elim, et venerunt omnis coetus filiorum Israelis ad desertum Sin, quod inter 
Elim et inter Sinai, in quintodecimo die, mensi secundo, ad exire illorum e terra Aegypti. 	2.  Et murmurabant omnis coetus filiorum Israelis contra Moschen et contra Aharonem in deserto. 	3.  Et dixerunt 
ad illos filii Israelis, Quis dabit? mortui fuissemus manu JEHOVAE in terra Aegypti, in sedendo nos ad ollam carnis, in edendo nos panem ad satietatem; quia eduxistis nos ad desertum hoc, ad occidendum 
omnem congregationem hanc fame. 	4.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Moschen, Ecce Ego pluere faciens vobis panem e caelo, et exibit populus, et colligent verbum diei in die suo, propterea ut tentem illum, 
num ambulat in lege Mea, si non. 	5.  Et erit in die sexto, et praeparent quod adduxerunt, et erit duplum super quod colligent die die. 	6.  Et dixit Moscheh et Aharon ad omnes filios Israelis, 
Vesperi et cognoscetis quod JEHOVAH eduxerit vos e terra Aegypti. 	7.  Et mane et videbitis gloriam JEHOVAE, in audire Ipsum murmurationes vestras contra JEHOVAM; et nos quid quod murmuretis contra nos? 	8. 
 Et dixit Moscheh, In dare JEHOVAM vobis in vespera carnem ad edendum, et panem in matuta ad satiandum; in audire JEHOVAM murmurationes vestras, quibus vos murmurantes contra Ipsum; nos quid? 
non contra nos murmurationes vestrae, quod contra JEHOVAM. 	9.  Et dixit Moscheh ad Aharonem, Dic ad omnem coetum filiorum Israelis, Appropinquate coram JEHOVAH, quia audivit murmurationes vestras. 	10. 
 Et fuit ut loqui Aharon ad omnem coetum filiorum Israelis, et respexerunt ad desertum, et ecce gloria JEHOVAE visa in nube. 	11.  Et locutus est JEHOVAH ad Moschen, dicendo, 	12.  Audivi murmurationes 
filiorum Israelis; loquere ad illos, dicendo, Inter vesperas comedetis carnem, et in matuta satiabimini pane, et cognoscetis quod Ego JEHOVAH DEUS vester. 	13.  Et factum in vespera, et ascendit 
selav, et obtexit castra; et in matuta fuit positio roris circum castra. 	14.  Et {1}ascendit positio roris, et ecce super facies deserti minutum rotundum, minutum sicut pruina super terra. 	@1 
descendit altered to ascendit then d, i and d desiit i desiit again.  cp n. 8450, 8456$ 	15.  Et viderunt filii Israelis, et dixerunt vir ad fratrem suum, Man hoc? quia non sciverunt quid hoc; et dixit 
Moscheh ad illos, Hoc panis quem dedit JEHOVAH vobis ad edendum. 	16.  Hoc verbum quod praecepit JEHOVAH, Colligite de eo, quisque ad os edere sui, omerem ad caput, numerum animarum vestrarum, quisque 
ei qui in tentorio suo, accipite. 	17.  Et fecerunt ita filii Israelis, et collegerunt redigens ad numerosum et ad paucum. 	18.  Et mensi sunt omere, et non superfluum fecit numeroso, et pauco 
non defuit; quisque ad os edere sui collegerunt. 	19.  Et dixit Moscheh ad illos, Quisque ne residuum faciat de illo usque ad mane. 	20.  Et non audiverunt ad Moschen, et residuum fecerunt viri ex 
illo usque ad mane, et vermiculavit vermes, et computruit; et succensuit super illos Moscheh. 	21.  Et collegerunt illud mane mane, quisque secundum os edere sui; et incaluit sol et liquefactum est. 	22. 
 Et fuit in die sexto collegerunt panem duplum, duos omeres uni; et venerunt omnes principes coetus, et indicaverunt Moschi. 	23.  Et dixit ad illos, Hoc quod locutus JEHOVAH, Requies, sabbatum 
sanctum JEHOVAE cras; quod coquetis coquite, et quod (x)elixabitis elixate, et omne superfluum reponite hoc vobis ad custodiam usque ad mane. 	24.  Et reposuerunt illud ad mane, quemadmodum praecepit 
Moscheh, et non computruit, et vermis non fuit in illo. 	25.  Et dixit Moscheh, Comedite illud hodie, quia sabbatum hodie JEHOVAE; hodie non invenietis illud in agro. 	26.  Sex diebus colligetis 
illud, et in die septimo sabbatum, non erit in eo. 	27.  Et fuit in die septimo exiverunt e populo ad colligendum, et non invenerunt. 	28.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Moschen, Quousque renuitis custodire praecepta 
Mea, et leges Meas? 	29.  Videte quia JEHOVAH dedit vobis sabbatum, propterea Ille dat vobis in die sexto panem duorum dierum; quiescite quisque sub se, ne exeat quisquam e loco suo in die septimo. 	30. 
 Et quieverunt populus in die septimo. 	31.  Et vocaverunt domus Israelis nomen ejus man; et hoc sicut semen coriandri album, et sapor ejus sicut placentae in melle. 	32.  Et dixit Moscheh, 
Hoc verbum quod praecepit, JEHOVAH, Imple omerem ex illo ad custodiam generationibus vestris, propterea ut videant panem quo cibavi vos in deserto, in educere Me vos e terra Aegypti. 	33.  Et dixit 
Moscheh ad Aharonem, Accipe urnam unam, et da ibi plenitudinem omeris man, et repone illud coram JEHOVAH, ad custodiam generationibus vestris. 	34.  Quemadmodum praecepit JEHOVAH ad Moschen, et 
reposuit illud Aharon coram Testimonio ad custodiam. 	35.  Et filii Israelis comederunt man quadraginta annis, usque ad venire illos ad terram habitatam; man comederunt usque ad venire illos ad terminum 
terrae Canaanis. 	36.  Et omer decima pars ephae illud. </p>
