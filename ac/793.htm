<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第793节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>793.</strong>从这里直到本章结尾，所论述的主题是灭绝的大洪水前的人，这从所描述的细节明显可知。通晓内义的人马上，甚至仅仅通过一句话就能意识到所论述的主题是什么，通过连贯的几句话知道得更清楚。当主题发生变化时，立刻会出现不同的词，或相同的词有了不同的组合。原因在于，有些词是属灵事物所特有的，有些词则是属天事物所特有的。换句话说，有些词是觉知之物所特有的，有些词是意愿之物所特有的。例如，“荒废”用来称谓属灵事物，“消磨”用来称谓属天事物；“城”用来称谓属灵事物，“山”用来称谓属天事物，诸如此类。这同样适用于词组。令人惊讶的是，在希伯来语中，词语常常通过发音来区分。在属灵类的词语中，前三个元音通常居于主导地位，但在属天类的词语中，后两个元音通常居于主导地位。这些经文包含不同的主题，这一点从早就讨论过的重复清楚看出来。也就是说，这里“水势在地上越来越大”是前节经文内容（水势在地上大大地往上长）的一个重复，这从下文也明显可知。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]793.</strong> From here to the end of the chapter, the topic being discussed is the pre-Flood people who perished, as can be seen from the individual parts of the description. Anyone alive to the inner meaning can tell instantly what the subject is, even from a single word, and even more easily from the connections among many words. When the topic changes, different words suddenly come into use, or else the previous words are linked together in a new way. The reason for the shift is that spiritual themes have their own special vocabulary and heavenly themes have theirs, or to put it another way, intellectual matters have their own vocabulary and volitional ones theirs. Ruination, for example, is a word that applies to spiritual things, while devastation applies to heavenly things; a city has to do with spiritual things, while a mountain has to do with heavenly things; and so on. The same holds true for the ways that words link together.<br />No one could help being surprised to learn that in Hebrew it is often sound that distinguishes the two. In words that belong to the spiritual category, the first three vowels [of the Hebrew alphabet] usually predominate. In those that capture heavenly qualities, the last two vowels do.{*1} The changing of topics here can be recognized by such signs, and also by the repetition involved (as discussed previously [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_793/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_435" target=_top>435</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_793/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_683" target=_top>683</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_793/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_707" target=_top>707</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_793/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_734" target=_top>734</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_793/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_765" target=_top>765</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_793/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_782" target=_top>782</a>]). To be specific, it says again here, "And the water strengthened greatly, greatly on the earth," as the last verse also said. The fact of a switch can also be recognized from everything that follows.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} In the Hebrew alphabet, the first three vowels correspond roughly to English a, e, and i; the last two, to o and u. In later comments on this subject, Swedenborg gradually moves the a vowel into the heavenly category.

The subject now treated of, up to the end of this chapter, is the antediluvians who perished, as is evident from the particulars of the description. They who are in the internal sense can know instantly, 
and indeed from a single word, what subject is treated of; and especially can they know this from the connection of several words. When a different subject is taken up, at once the words are different, 
or the same words stand in a different connection. The reason is that there are words peculiar to spiritual things, and words peculiar to celestial things; or, what is the same, there are words 
peculiar to matters of understanding, and others to matters of will. For example: the word "desolation" is predicated of spiritual things, and "vastation" of celestial things; "city" is predicated of 
spiritual things, "mountain" of celestial things; and so on. The case is the same with the connective expressions. And (what cannot fail to be a matter of surprise) in the Hebrew language the words are 
very often distinguishable by their sound; for in those which belong to the spiritual class the first three vowels are usually dominant, and in words that are of the celestial class, the last two vowels. 
That in these verses a different subject is now treated of, appears also from the repetition already spoken of (in that it is here again said, as in the preceding verse, "and the waters were strengthened 
very exceedingly upon the earth"), and the same is evident also from what follows. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 793</b></p><p><b>793.</b>
From this point onwards to the end of the present chapter the subject is the people before the Flood who perished. This becomes clear from the details in the description given. People who possess the 
internal sense can recognize instantly, and indeed from any single word, what the subject is, better still from the combination of many. When the subject changes different words instantly appear, or 
else the same words combined differently. The reason is that some words are peculiar to spiritual matters, others peculiar to celestial; or what amounts to the same, some are peculiar to things of the 
understanding, others to those of the will. For example, 'desolation' is a word used of spiritual things, vastation' of celestial; 'city' is used of spiritual, 'mountain' of celestial; and so on. The 
same applies to combinations of words. And what is bound to amaze everybody, the difference in Hebrew is frequently just a matter of vocalization. In what belongs to the class of spiritual words the 
first three vowels [of the alphabet] are normally prominent, but in the case of what is celestial the last two. The fact that these verses contain a different subject is also discernible from the repetition 
discussed already. That is to say, the statement, 'And the waters grew stronger and stronger over the earth', is a repetition of what has already been stated in the previous verse. It is also discernible 
from everything that follows. </p>

Hic nunc usque ad finem hujus capitis agitur de antediluvianis qui perierunt, quod constare potest a singulis descriptionis; qui in sensu interno sunt, ilico et quidem ex unica voce scire possunt de 
qua re agitur, magis ex connexu plurium; cum de alia re agitur, ilico sunt aliae voces, aut eaedem voces aliter connexae; causa est quia voces peculiares sunt pro rebus spiritualibus et peculiares pro 
caelestibus, seu quod idem, pro intellectualibus et pro voluntariis; sicut pro exemplo, 'desolatio' est vox spiritualium, 'vastatio' est caelestium; 'urbs' est spiritualium, 'mons' est caelestium, et 
sic porro; similiter in connexionibus; et quod quisque non potest non mirari, in lingua Hebraea distinguuntur persaepe sono; quae ad classem spiritualium pertinent, in iis dominari solent vocales tres 
primae; in quibus caelestia, vocales binae ultimae: quod hic nunc de alia re agatur, etiam inde cognoscitur, tum a repetitione, de qua prius, quod nempe hic iterum dicatur, 'Et aquae corroboratae sunt 
valde valde super terra,' quod in vers. praec. etiam dictum; tum ab omnibus quae sequuntur. </p>
