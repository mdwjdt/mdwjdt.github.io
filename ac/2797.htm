<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2797.</strong>创世记22:6.亚伯拉罕取了燔祭的柴，放在他儿子以撒身上，自己手里拿着火与刀，于是二人同行。<br />“亚伯拉罕取了燔祭的柴”表公义的功德。“放在他儿子以撒身上”表它与神圣理性相联结。“自己手里拿着火与刀”表爱之善与信之真。“于是二人同行”表（神性本身与神圣理性）尽可能地融合。</p>

Verse 6. And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife; and they went both of them together. "Abraham took the wood of 
the burnt-offering," signifies the merit of righteousness; "and laid it upon Isaac," signifies that it was adjoined to the Divine rational; "and he took in his hand the fire and the knife," signifies 
the good of love and the truth of faith; "and they went both of them together," signifies unition as far as possible. </p>

Verse 6 And Abraham took the pieces of wood for the burnt offering and laid them on Isaac his son; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife, and the two of them went on together. </p>
<p>'Abraham took 
the pieces of wood for the burnt offering' means the merit of righteousness. 'And laid them on Isaac his son' means that it was joined to the Divine Rational. 'And he took in his hand the fire and 
the knife' means the good of love and the truth of faith. 'And the two of them went on together' means the closest possible union then [of the Divine itself and the Divine Rational]. </p>

Vers. 6.  Et accepit Abraham ligna holocausti, et posuit super Jishako filio suo; et accepit in manu sua ignem et cultrum, et iverunt ambo illi simul. `Accepit Abraham ligna holocausti' significat meritum 
justitiae: `et posuit super Jishako filio suo' significat quod adjunctum Rationali Divino: `et accepit in manu sua ignem et cultrum' significat bonum amoris et verum fidei: `et iverunt ambo illi 
simul' significat unitionem quantum possibile. </p>
