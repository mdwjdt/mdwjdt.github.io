<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7097节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7097.</strong>“我不认识耶和华”表他们对主毫无兴趣。这从“不认识”的含义清楚可知，“不认识”是指没有兴趣，因为对某事不感兴趣的人会说，他对这事一无所知；“耶和华”表示主（参看<a href="7091.htm">7091</a>节）。至于法老说，“他不认识耶和华”，情况是这样：埃及人自古时就认识耶和华，因为古教会也曾存在于埃及；这一点从以下事实明显看出来：他们掌握该教会的代表和有意义的符号。埃及的象形文字并非别的，因为这些文字表示属灵事物；他们还知道它们确实对应于这些真实事物。但他们因开始在神圣敬拜中使用这类代表和符号，把它们当作崇拜的对象，最终把它们变成法术，以这种方式与地狱中的魔鬼团伙联在一起，故完全毁灭了他们当中的古教会。这就是为何在圣言中，“埃及人”表示被败坏的教会所知的记忆知识，以及反对教会真理的虚假。<br />一旦对神的敬拜以这种方式在埃及被败坏，他们就不再被允许敬拜耶和华，最终甚至不知道耶和华是古教会的神；这是为了防止他们亵渎耶和华的名。耶和华的名又一次在何烈山上通过摩西显给亚伯拉罕的后代之前，在那时也为人所知；这一点从以下事实很清楚地看出来：来自亚兰或叙利亚的巴兰不仅认识耶和华，还敬拜祂，向祂献祭（民数记22，23，24）。由此可见为何法老说：“耶和华是谁，我要听祂的声音，容这百姓去呢？我不认识耶和华。”<br />不过，由于“法老”代表那些在地狱中陷入虚假，侵扰属灵教会成员的人，故有必要说一说这一切是怎么回事。那些在地狱中侵扰属灵教会成员的人大部分是由那种声称唯信得救，然而又过着违背信仰的生活之人组成。由于他们所过的生活，因而他们所曾思想、密谋和行出的邪恶在肉身死后仍旧存留，所以他们要么利用他们所说的那些属于信仰的事来护卫他们生活的邪恶，要么完全弃绝它们。但为了防止他们滥用信之真理，这些真理从他们那里被夺走。当被剥夺这些真理时，他们就抓住完全违背信之真理的虚假，然后利用这些虚假来侵扰那些处于真理的人。这时，如此行就是他们生活的快乐。此外，他们当中有相当多的人为了获得能力学习巫术。这就是那些利用在世时用来欺骗邻舍所设计的各种诡计，并因得逞而后来将一切事都归于自己的精明之人所行的。<br />那些已然变得如此之人承认父是宇宙的创造者，但他们不承认主。对于主，他们所说和此处法老所说的很相似，即“耶和华是谁，我不认识耶和华”。事实上，正如天堂的整个气场充满对主的承认和爱，地狱的整个气场则充满对主的否认和对祂的仇恨；连提及祂的名，他们都无法忍受。地狱里的人具有这样的性质：他们不会由于告诉和威吓而停止，他们侵扰正直人，将其从对主的承认和对祂的信中引离的生活快乐是如此之大。他们生活的这种快乐因着停止的告诫反而增强了，因为这使得他们以为他们正在侵扰的人很快就完了。这些人就是“法老”和“埃及人”具体所表示的人。</p>

I know not Jehovah. That this signifies that they do not care for the Lord, is evident from the signification of "not knowing," as being not to care, for he who does not care, says that he does not know. 
(That by "Jehovah" is meant the Lord, see n. 7091.) As to Pharaoh's saying that "he did not know Jehovah," the case is this. The Egyptians from ancient time knew Jehovah, because in Egypt also there 
had been the Ancient Church, as can be plainly seen from the fact that they had among them the representatives and significatives of that church. The hieroglyphics of the Egyptians are nothing else; 
for by these were signified spiritual things, and they also knew that they actually corresponded; and as they began to employ such things in their sacred worship, and to worship them, and at last also 
to turn them into magic, and in this way to be associated with the devilish crew in hell, they therefore utterly destroyed the Ancient Church among them. Hence it is that by the "Egyptians" in the 
Word are signified the memory-knowledges of the church perverted, and also falsities contrary to the truths of the church. [2] When Divine worship had been thus perverted in Egypt, then also they were 
no longer allowed to worship Jehovah, and finally not even to know that Jehovah was the God of the Ancient Church, and this in order that they might not profane the name of Jehovah. That the name of 
Jehovah was known at that time also, and this before it was again told to the posterity of Abraham through Moses in Mount Horeb, is very plain from the fact that Balaam, who was of Syria, not only knew 
Jehovah, but also adored Him, and likewise sacrificed to Him (Num. 22, 23, 24). From all this it can be known why Pharaoh said "Who is Jehovah, whose voice I should hear to let the people go? I know 
not Jehovah."  [3] But as by Pharaoh are represented those in the hells who are in falsities, and who infest those of the spiritual church, therefore it must be told how the case is with these. They 
who are in the hells, and infest those who are of the spiritual church, are for the most part from such as have said that faith alone saves, and yet have lived a life contrary to faith; and as after 
the death of the body the life remains, thus the evil which they have thought, plotted, and done, therefore they either apply those things which they have said to be of faith to defend the evils of 
their life, or they altogether reject them. But lest they should abuse the truths of faith, they are deprived of them, and when they are deprived of them, they seize upon falsities, which are quite contrary 
to the truths of faith, and afterward by means of falsities infest those who are in truths. This is then the delight of their life. Moreover, some of them, in order to acquire power, learn magical 
arts. This is done by those who by various arts which they devised in the world have deceived the neighbor, and in consequence of their success have afterward attributed all things to their own prudence. [4] 
They who have become such, acknowledge the Father the Creator of the universe, but not the Lord. Of the Lord they say as Pharaoh here says of Jehovah, "Who is Jehovah? I know not Jehovah." 
Nay, as the universal sphere of heaven is full of the acknowledgment and love of the Lord, so is the universal sphere of the hells full of the denial of the Lord and of hatred against Him; neither can 
they endure that He should be named. The infernals are such that they do not desist on account of exhortations and threats, so great is the delight of their life in infesting the upright, and turning 
them from the acknowledgment of the Lord, and from faith in Him. This very delight of their life is increased by exhortations to desist, for this leads them to believe that it will shortly be all over 
with those whom they are infesting. These then are they who are specifically meant by "Pharaoh and the Egyptians." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7097</b></p><p><b>7097.</b>
'I do not know Jehovah' means that they have no interest in the Lord. This is clear from the meaning of 'not knowing' as having no interest in, for a person who has no interest in something says that 
he knows nothing about it; and 'Jehovah' is used to mean the Lord, see above in <a href="7091.htm">7091</a>. The implications of this, of Pharaoh's saying that he does not know Jehovah, are as follows: The Egyptians had known 
Jehovah since ancient times, the reason being that the Ancient Church had existed in Egypt also, as may be plainly recognized from the fact that they were in possession of the representatives and 
meaningful signs of that Church. Egyptian hieroglyphics are nothing else, for these served to denote spiritual realities; and people knew that they did in actual fact correspond to those realities. But 
because they began to use such representatives and signs in their sacred worship, to treat them as objects of worship and also at length to turn them into magic, and in so doing to become linked to 
the devil's crew in hell, they completely destroyed the Ancient Church among themselves. This is why in the Word 'the Egyptians' means facts known to the Church that have been perverted, and also falsities 
that are opposed to the truths of the Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Once the worship of God had become perverted in this way in Egypt, then they were no longer allowed to worship Jehovah either, or at length even 
to know that Jehovah had been the God of the Ancient Church; and the reason why this happened was to prevent them from profaning the name of Jehovah. The fact that the name of Jehovah was also known 
at that time, before it was revealed once again to Abraham's descendants through Moses on Mount Horeb, is plainly evident from Balaam, who was from Syria. He not only knew Jehovah but also worshipped 
Him and offered sacrifice to Him, Numbers <a href="22.htm">22</a>-<a href="24.htm">24</a>. From all this one may now see why Pharaoh said, 'Who is Jehovah whose voice I am to hear, [telling me] to send the people away? I do not know Jehovah.' </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
But since 'Pharaoh' represents those in hell who are steeped in falsities and molest those belonging to the spiritual Church, what is involved in all this needs to be stated. Those in hell 
who molest members of the spiritual Church consist for the most part of the kind of people who have said that faith alone saves and yet have led a life contrary to faith. And since the life they have 
led, thus the evil which they have contemplated, planned, and carried out, remains after death of the body, therefore to defend the evils assimilated into their life they either employ the things which 
they have said were matters of faith or else reject them altogether. But to prevent them from misusing the truths of faith, these are taken away from them. And when those truths have been taken they 
seize on falsities, which are completely contrary to the truths of faith, and then use the falsities to molest those guided by truths. Doing this is then for them the delight of life. Quite a number 
of them, to acquire power, also learn magic. This is done by those who used various tricks which they devised in the world to deceive their neighbour, and being successful then attributed everything to 
their own prudence.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Those who have become like this acknowledge the Father as the Creator of all things, but they do not acknowledge the Lord. Regarding the Lord they use similar words to Pharaoh's 
here regarding Jehovah, 'Who is Jehovah? I do not know Jehovah'. Indeed just as the whole sphere pervading heaven is full of an acknowledgement of and love for the Lord, so the whole sphere pervading 
the hells is full of a denial of the Lord and of hatred towards Him. Nor can they bear to hear His name mentioned. Those in hell are by nature such that admonitions and threats do not make them 
leave off, so great is the delight of their life to molest the upright and draw them away from their acknowledgement of the Lord and faith in Him. That delight is intensified by the admonitions they 
receive to leave off, for they lead them to imagine that those whom they molest will shortly be done for. These are the ones whom 'Pharaoh' and 'the Egyptians' are used to mean specifically.  </p>

`Non novi Jehovam': quod significet quod Dominum non curent, constat ex significatione `non nosse' quod sit non curare, nam qui non curat, is dicit se non nosse; quod per `Jehovam' intelligatur Dominus, 
videatur supra n. (x)7091.  Cum hoc, quod Pharao dicit se non nosse Jehovam, ita se habet: Aegyptii ab antiquo tempore noverunt Jehovam, ex causa quia etiam in Aegypto {1}fuerat Ecclesia Antiqua, 
ut manifeste constare potest ex eo quod apud se Ecclesiae illius repraesentativa et significativa habuerint; hieroglyphica Aegyptiaca {2} non aliud sunt; per illa enim significabantur spiritualia, etiam 
sciverunt quod actualiter corresponderent; et quia incipiebant adhibere talia in cultu suo sacro, et {3} colere illa, et tandem quoque {4}vertere in magica, et sic associari turbae diabolicae in inferno, 
idcirco apud se Antiquam Ecclesiam prorsus destruxerunt; inde est quod per `Aegyptios' in Verbo significentur scientifica Ecclesiae perversa, tum falsa quae sunt contra vera Ecclesiae. 	2 Cum 
ita in Aegypto cultus Divinus perversus fuit, tunc quoque non amplius licuit eis colere Jehovam, et demum ne quidem scire quod Jehovah fuerit Deus Ecclesiae Antiquae, et hoc ob causam, ne profanarent 
nomen Jehovae.  Quod nomen Jehovae etiam illa tempore notum fuerit, et hoc antequam iterum {5}Abrahami posteris per Moschen in Monte Chorebo indicatum est, evidenter patet ex eo quod Bileamus, qui fuit 
ex Syria, non modo noverit Jehovam sed etiam adoraverit Ipsum et quoque sacrificaverit Ipsi, Num. xxii-xxiv.  Ex his {6}nunc sciri potest quare Pharao dixit, `Quis Jehovah Cujus vocem audiam, ad dimittendum 
populum? non novi Jehovam.' 	3 At quia per Pharaonem repraesentantur illi in infernis qui in falsis sunt, et infestant illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, idcirco dicendum quomodo cum his se 
{7}habet: qui in infernis sunt, ac infestant illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, sunt plerique ex talibus qui dixerunt quod sola fides salvet, et tamen vixerunt vitam fidei contrariam; et quia post mortem 
corporis vita remanet, ita malum quod cogitarunt, {7} machinati sunt, et fecerunt, idcirco ad defendendum vitae suae mala, vel applicant illa quae dixerunt esse fidei, vel illa prorsus rejiciunt; at 
ne abutantur veris fidei, deprivantur illis; quibus cum deprivati sunt, falsa, quae prorsus contra vera fidei sunt, arripiunt, et {9}dein per falsa infestant illos qui in veris sunt; hoc illis tunc 
jucundum vitae est; plures etiam illorum, ut sibi potentiam comparent, magica addiscunt; hoc faciunt illi qui per varias artes quas excogitarunt in mundo proximum fefellerunt, ac ex successu omnia dein 
suae prudentiae attribuerunt. 	4 Illi qui tales facti sunt agnoscunt Patrem Creatorem universi, non autem Dominum; de Domino dicunt sicut hic Pharao de Jehovah, `Quis Jehovah? non novi Jehovam'; immo 
sicut est sphaera universalis caeli plena agnitione et amore Domini, ita est sphaera universalis infernorum plena negatione {10}Domini et odio contra Ipsum; nec sustinent ut nominetur.  {11} Infernales 
illi tales sunt ut per exhortationes et minas non desistant, {12}tantum enim est jucundum vitae (c)eorum {13} infestare probos, et eos ab agnitione Domini et fide in Ipsum amovere; ipsum illud vitae 
eorum jucundum augetur per exhortationes ut desistant, inde enim credunt quod brevi actum sit cum illis quos infestant.  Hi nunc sunt qui per `Pharaonem' et per `Aegyptios' in specie intelliguntur. 	@1
