<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8678节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8678.</strong>“因为埃及人狂傲地对待这百姓”表由于被用来掌控那些属于教会之人的努力和力量。这从“狂傲地对待”的含义和以色列人的代表清楚可知：“狂傲地对待”是指被用来进行掌控的努力和力量，如下文所述；以色列人，就是他们所狂傲对待的，是指那些属于属灵教会的人（参看<a href="8645.htm">8645</a>节）。“狂傲地对待”之所以表示被用来进行掌控的努力和力量，是因为这种努力和由此而来的力量就存在于一切狂傲或骄傲之中，因为狂傲或骄傲就在于爱自我胜过他人，将自我置于他人之上，想要对他人发号施令；那些想如此行的人在与自己相比时，也鄙视他人，还出于仇恨和报复迫害那些将自己置于他们之上，或不尊敬他们的人。对自我的爱，就是狂傲或骄傲，具有这样的性质：只要给它缰绳，它就会飞奔而去，在每一步都尽可能地加速，直到最终到达神的宝座，想要取代神。凡在地狱里的人都是这样。他们的这种性质从那里所发出的他们的努力能察觉出来，也能从他们为了掌权而对彼此的仇恨和可怕报复察觉出来。主所约束的，就是这种努力；这种努力也是“女人的种所要踹的蛇头”所表示的（<a href="257.htm">257</a>节）。在以赛亚书中，“路西弗”也表示这类灵人：<br />早晨之子路西弗啊，你何竟从天坠落？你已被砍倒在地，在列族之下衰弱；你心里曾说，我要升到天上！我要高举我的宝座在神众星以上；我要坐在会众的山上，在北方的极处；我要升到云的高处，我要与至高者一样。然而你竟被送下阴间，到坑中的极处。你已从你的坟墓中被抛出，好像可憎的枝子，像被杀之人的衣服，像被剑刺透，坠落坑中石头那里的；你又像被践踏的尸首一样。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.12.htm">14:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.15.htm">15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.19.htm">19</a>）<br />内心的骄傲，就是对自我的爱，把神性从自己那里赶走，把天堂从自己那里移除，这一点可从接受神性和天堂的状态，就是对邻之爱的状态和对神谦卑的状态很清楚地看出来。一个人能在主面前谦卑自己，能爱邻如己，甚至如在天堂那样爱邻胜己到何等程度，就在何等程度上接受神性，并因此活在天堂中。由此可见那些爱邻胜己的人处于什么样的状态，而那些“狂傲地对待他，也就是陷入自我之爱的人处于什么样的状态；也就是说，他们处于反对天堂和神性的状态，因而处于地狱里的人所处的状态。关于自我之爱，可参看前面的阐述和说明（<a href="2041.htm">2041</a>，<a href="2045.htm">2045</a>，<a href="2051.htm">2051</a>，<a href="2057.htm">2057</a>，<a href="2219.htm">2219</a>，<a href="2363.htm">2363</a>，<a href="2364.htm">2364</a>，<a href="2444.htm">2444</a>，<a href="3413.htm">3413</a>，<a href="3610.htm">3610</a>，<a href="4225.htm">4225</a>，<a href="4750.htm">4750</a>，<a href="4776.htm">4776</a>，<a href="4947.htm">4947</a>，<a href="5721.htm">5721</a>，<a href="6667.htm">6667</a>，<a href="7178.htm">7178</a>，<a href="7255.htm">7255</a>，<a href="7364.htm">7364</a>，<a href="7366.htm">7366</a>-<a href="7377.htm">7377</a>，<a href="7488.htm">7488</a>-<a href="7492.htm">7492</a>，<a href="7494.htm">7494</a>，<a href="7643.htm">7643</a>，<a href="7819.htm">7819</a>，<a href="7820.htm">7820</a>，<a href="8318.htm">8318</a>，<a href="8487.htm">8487</a>节）。</p>

For the reason that they dealt proudly over them. That this signifies by reason of the endeavor and the force used to rule over those who are of the church, is evident from the signification of "dealing 
proudly," as being the endeavor and the force used to rule (of which below); and from the representation of the sons of Israel, who are they over whom they dealt proudly, as being those who are of 
the spiritual church (see above, n. 8645). That "to deal proudly" denotes the endeavor and the force used to rule, is because this endeavor and the consequent force are in all pride, for pride is to 
love self more than others, and to set self above them, and to wish to exercise command over others; and they who wish this also despise others in comparison with self, and also persecute from hatred 
and revenge those who set themselves above them, or do not pay them respect. The love of self, which is pride, is of such a quality that so far as the rein is given it, it rushes on, growing step by step 
to the utmost of the ability that is granted to it, until at last it lifts itself to the very throne of God with the desire to be in His stead. Such are all who are in hell. That they are such is 
perceived from their endeavor from there, and also from their dangerous hatreds and direful revenges one against another for the sake of rule. This endeavor is what is restrained by the Lord, and is meant 
by "the head of the serpent which the seed of the woman shall trample on" (n. 257). Such are also meant by "Lucifer" in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     How hast thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the dawn! 
thou hast been cut off to the earth, thou hath been weakened beneath the nations; yet thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into the heavens, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; and 
I will sit on the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north; I will ascend above the heights of the cloud; I will become like the Most High. Yet verily thou hast been let down to hell, to 
the sides of the pit, thou hast been cast forth out of thy sepulcher like an abominable shoot, the raiment of the slain, thrust through with the sword, that go down to the stones of the pit, like a carcass 
that is trampled on (Isa. 14:2-15, 19). [2] That pride of heart, which is the love of self, repels from itself the Divine, and removes heaven from itself, can be plainly seen from the state of 
reception of the Divine and of heaven, which is a state of love toward the neighbor, and a state of humiliation toward God. So far as a man can humble himself before the Lord, and so far as he can love 
his neighbor as himself, and, as in heaven, above himself, so far he receives the Divine, and consequently is so far in heaven. From all this it is evident in what state are those who love themselves 
more than the neighbor, and who "deal proudly over him," that is, who are in the love of self; namely, that they are in a state opposite to heaven and to the Divine, consequently in the state in which 
the infernals are. (See what has been already said and shown about the love of self, n. 2041, 2045, 2051, 2057, 2219, 2363, 2364, 2444, 3413, 3610, 4225, 4750, 4776, 4947, 5721, 6667, 7178, 7255, 7364, 
7366-7377, 7488-7492, 7494, 7643, 7819, 7820, 8318, 8487.) </p>

'For this reason, that they behaved proudly over them' means because of the endeavour and the force used to exercise control over those belonging to the Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'behaving 
proudly' as the endeavour and the force used to exercise control, dealt with below; and from the representation of the children of Israel, who are the ones over whom they behaved proudly, as those 
belonging to the spiritual Church, dealt with above in <a href="8645.htm">8645</a>. The reason why 'behaving proudly' means the endeavour and the force used to exercise control is that kind of endeavour and the force used 
as a result are present in all pride; for pride consists in loving self more than others, putting self before others, and wishing to rule others. Those who wish to do this also despise others in comparison 
with themselves, and in addition out of hatred and vengeance persecute others who put themselves before them or do not pay respect to them. The nature of self-love, which is pride, is such that 
so far as it is given rein it gallops away, gaining speed with every possible step it can take, till eventually it reaches the very throne of God - wishing to usurp God. This is what all in hell are 
like. What they are like is revealed by their endeavours emanating from there, and also by their intense feelings of hatred for one another and their awful acts of revenge because of their wish to exercise 
control. That endeavour is one that is curbed by the Lord; and it is what is meant by the head of the serpent which the seed of the woman will tread down, <a href="257.htm">257</a>. Such spirits also are meant by Lucifer 
in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
How have you fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the Dawn? You have been cut down to the earth, you have been weakened below the nations. And you said in your heart, I will go up 
the heavens, above the stars of God I will raise my throne, and I will sit on the mount of assembly, in the furthest parts of the north; I will go up above the heights of the clouds, and I will make 
myself like the Most High. But you have in truth been sent down to hell, to the sides of the pit. You have been cast out of the sepulchre like an abominable branch, [like] a garment of the killed, [like] 
those pierced with the sword, who go down to the stones of the pit like a dead body trodden underfoot. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2014:12-19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 14:12-19</a>.

 The fact that pride of heart, which is self-love, drives the Divine away 
from itself and puts heaven away from itself becomes perfectly clear from that state in which the Divine and heaven find acceptance, which is a state of love towards the neighbour and a state of humility 
towards God. To the extent that a person can humble himself before the Lord, to the extent that he can love his neighbour as himself, and - as they do in heaven - above himself, he accepts the Divine 
and for that reason lives in heaven. From this one can see what the state is of those who love themselves more than their neighbour, and who behave proudly towards him, that is, who are ruled by 
self-love. One can see that it is a state in which they are opposed to heaven and to the Divine; it is therefore the state in which those in hell live. See what has been stated and shown about self-love

`Quia eapropter quod superbiverint super illos': quod (x)significet ob conatum et vim dominandi super illos qui ab Ecclesia, constat ex significatione `superbire' quod sit conatus et vis dominandi, 
de qua sequitur, et ex repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis,' qui sunt illi super quos superbiverunt, quod sint qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, de qua supra n. 8645.  Quod `superbire' sit {1}conatus et vis 
dominandi, est quia {2}ille conatus et inde vis inest omni superbiae, superbia enim est amare se prae aliis, seque illis praeferre, {3}et velle aliis imperare; et qui hoc volunt etiam contemnunt alios 
prae se, et quoque {4}persequuntur ex odio et vindicta illos qui se praeferunt, aut non colunt; amor sui, qui est superbia, est talis ut quantum ei relaxatur frenum, tantum ruat, crescendo ad quemvis 
gradum datae possibilitatis, usque tandem ad ipsum solium Divinum, {5}ut velint pro deo esse; tales sunt omnes qui in inferno; quod tales sint appercipitur ex conatu illorum inde, et quoque ab eorum 
infestis odiis et diris vindictis unius contra alterum propter dominatum; ille conatus est qui a Domino coercetur, et qui intelligitur per `caput serpentis, quod semen mulieris conculcabit,' n. 257; 
tales etiam intelliguntur per Luciferum apud Esaiam, Quomodo {6}cecidisti de caelo, Lucifer fili Aurorae; excisus es in terram, infirmatus es infra gentes; atqui tu dixisti in corde tuo, Caelos ascendam, 
super stellas Dei exaltabo thronum meum, et sedebo in monte conventus, in lateribus septentrionis; ascendam super excelsa nubis, similis fiam Altissimo; verum enim vero ad infernum demissus es, ad 
latera foveae: projectus es e sepulcro, sicut surculus abominabilis, vestimentum occisorum, confossi gladio, qui descendunt ad lapides foveae, sicut cadaver conculcatum, xiv 12-19. 	2 Quod superbia 
cordis, quae est amor sui, repellat a se Divinum, ac a, se removeat caelum, constare potest manifeste ex statu receptionis Divini ac caeli, qui est status amoris erga proximum, et est status humiliationis 
erga Deum; quantum homo se humiliare potest coram Domino, et quantum amare potest proximum sicut se, et prout fit in caelo, supra se, tantum {7}recipit Divinum, et inde tantum in caelo est; inde 
patet in quo statu sunt illi qui se amant prae proximo, et qui super illum superbiunt, hoc est, qui in amore sui sunt, quod nempe sint in statu opposito ad caelum et ad Divinum; {8}proinde in statu in 
quo infernales.  Videantur quae de amore sui n. 2041, 2045, 2051, 2057, 2219, 2363, 2364, 2444, 3413, 3610, 4225, 4750, 4776, 4947, 5721, 6667, 7178, 7255, (a)7364, 7366-7377, (x)7488, 7489, 7490-7492,
