<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8814节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8814.</strong>“在山上有浓云”表与那些即将接受的人有关的神性状态。这从“云”的含义清楚可知。“云”是指为那些即将接受之人所调整的真理，因而是指文字上的圣言（参看<a href="8443.htm">8443</a>，<a href="8781.htm">8781</a>节）；在此是指为出身于雅各的百姓所调整的神之真理。由于这百姓在神之真理上处于极大黑暗，所以此处提到“浓云”，前面（19:9）提到“密云”，后面（19:18）提到“如烧窑的烟一般”。他们所处的黑暗何等的大，这可从前面关于这个民族的阐述（<a href="8788.htm">8788</a>节），以及这一事实明显看出来：涉及内在人的事物并未揭示给他们，揭示给他们的，只是涉及外在人的事物。事实上，他们不理解，或根本不愿理解内在事物，因为这些违背他们的爱，而他们的爱是这样：他们应成为世界上所有人民当中地位最高、最显赫的，也是最富有的；与他们自己相比，其它一切民族都如无有。凡这些爱所在之处，天堂的爱都无法被接受，因为天堂的爱会的扼杀并窒息世俗的爱。这就是为何耶和华，也就是主在浓密的云中向他们显现的原因。类似情形存在于来世，在那里，那些沉浸于邪恶所生的虚假之人被浓密的乌云笼罩，这云的浓密和黑暗程度取决于虚假的质和量。这一景象出现在那里的每个人眼前；尽管如此，那里的太阳仍在不停地照耀着。关于这些事，可参看前面的阐述（<a href="6832.htm">6832</a>，<a href="8137.htm">8137</a>，<a href="8138.htm">8138</a>节）。一般来说，在来世，神性照着各人信和爱的性质或品质而向各人显现。</p>

And a heavy cloud upon the mountain. That this signifies a Divine state in respect to those who were about to receive, is evident from the signification of "a cloud," as being truth accommodated to those 
who are about to receive, thus the Word in the letter (see n. 8443, 8781); here truth Divine accommodated to the people descended from Jacob; and because this people was in great darkness as to truths 
Divine, it is therefore called "a heavy cloud," and above (verse 9) "the density of a cloud," and below (verse 18) "smoke of fire as the smoke of a furnace." In what great darkness they were, can 
be seen from what has been related above (n. 8788) about that nation, and also from the fact that the things which pertain to the internal man were not revealed to them, but only those which pertain 
to the external man. For they did not apprehend internal things, nor were they willing to apprehend them, because these were contrary to their loves, which were that they might be the most exalted of 
all peoples in the world, and also the most opulent of all, and that all other nations might be as nothing in comparison with them. Where these loves are, there heavenly loves cannot be received, for 
these are extinguished and suffocated by the worldly loves. This is the reason why Jehovah, that is, the Lord, appeared to them in a dense and heavy cloud, in like manner as is the case in the other 
life, where they who are in falsities from evil are encompassed with a dense and black cloud in accordance with the quality and the amount of the falsities. This appears to everyone there before the eyes, 
and yet the sun there is continually shining. (On this subject see what has been said above, n. 6832, 8137, 8138.) Speaking generally, the Divine in the other life appears to everyone according to 
the quality of his faith and love. </p>

'And a heavy cloud on the mountain' means the Divine state in relation to those about to receive. This is clear from the meaning of 'a cloud' as truth adjusted for those about to receive, that is, the 
Word in the letter, dealt with in <a href="8443.htm">8443</a>, <a href="8781.htm">8781</a>, at this point God's truth adjusted for the people descended from Jacob. Because they were in great darkness so far as God's truths were concerned, 'a heavy 
cloud' is spoken of here, 'in the thickness of a cloud' above in verse 9, and the smoke of the fire 'like the smoke of a furnace' in verse 18 below. How much darkness they were in may be recognized 
from what has been mentioned above regarding that nation in <a href="8788.htm">8788</a>, and also from the consideration that things involving the internal man were not revealed to them, only those involving the external. 
For they did not apprehend or have any wish to apprehend internal things, because these were contrary to their kinds of love, which were that they should be highest of all in the world and also richest 
of all, and that all nations elsewhere should be as nothing in comparison with themselves. Where these kinds of love prevail heavenly kinds cannot be received, for the former snuff out and smother 
the latter. This is the reason why Jehovah, that is, the Lord, appeared to them in a dense and heavy cloud. A similar situation exists in the next life, where those steeped in falsities arising from evil 
are surrounded by a dense, black cloud, how dense and black being determined by the nature and amount of the falsities This sight appears before the eyes of everyone there; even so, the sun there 
is shining constantly. Regarding these matters, see what has been stated already in <a href="6832.htm">6832</a>, <a href="8137.htm">8137</a>, <a href="8138.htm">8138</a>. Ordinarily the Divine appears in the next life to everyone according to the nature of their faith 
and love. </p>

`Et nubes gravis super monte': quod significet statum Divinum respective ad illos qui recepturi, constat ex significatione `nubis' quod sit verum accommodatum illis qui recepturi, ita Verbum in littera, 
de qua n. 8443, 8781, hic verum Divinum accommodatum {1}populo ex Jacobo, qui quia in magnis tenebris {2}erat quoad vera Divina, ideo dicitur `nubes gravis,' (c)ac supra `{3}densitate nubis,' {4}vers. 
9, ac infra `fumus ignis sicut fumus fornacis,' vers. 18; in quantis tenebris fuerint, constare potest ex illis quae supra de illa gente n. 8788 memorata sunt; et quoque ex eo quod illis non revelata 
sint quae interni hominis sunt sed solum quae externi, nam interna non capiebant nec capere volebant, quia {5}contraria erant illorum amoribus, qui erant ut omnium supremi in mundo essent, et quoque 
omnium opulentissimi, et quod omnes gentes alibi sicut nihili respective ad illos essent; ubi hi amores sunt, ibi amores caelestes non recipi possunt, nam hi exstinguuntur et suffocantur ab illis; 
haec causa est quod Jehovah, hoc est, Dominus, apparuerit (x)illis in densa et gravi nube; similiter sicut se habet in altera vita, qui in falsis ex malo sunt, illi circumfusi sunt nube densa et nigra 
secundum falsitatum quale et quantum; hoc apparet cuivis ibi ad {7}oculos, et usque tamen sol ibi continue lucet; de his videantur quae prius n. 6832, 8137, 8138; in genere, Divinum in altera vita 
apparet {8}cuivis secundum quale fidei et amoris ejus. @1 filiis Israelis$ @2 erant$ @3 densitas IT$ @4 Before densitate$ @5 After 8788$ @6 opposita$ @7 oculum$ @8 unicuivis$ </p>
