<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6854节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6854.</strong>“我下来是要救他们脱离埃及人的手”表祂要俯身把他们从虚假记忆知识的权能中释放出来，这些知识试图毁灭教会的真理。这从“下来”、“脱离”、“手”和“埃及人”的含义清楚可知：“下来”是指俯身，如下文所述；“脱离”是指释放，因为把人从虚假中释放出来的人释放他们，或使他们得自由；“手”是指能力（<a href="878.htm">878</a>，<a href="3387.htm">3387</a>，<a href="3563.htm">3563</a>，<a href="4931.htm">4931</a>-<a href="4937.htm">4937</a>，<a href="5544.htm">5544</a>节）；“埃及人”是指与教会真理对立（参看<a href="6651.htm">6651</a>，<a href="6679.htm">6679</a>，<a href="6683.htm">6683</a>节），因而试图毁灭它们的虚假记忆知识。至于主下来，情况是这样：当主来审判（<a href="1311.htm">1311</a>节）时，以及当祂来到低地，在此来到由“以色列人”所表示的那些属于属灵教会的人那里时，经上就说“祂下来”或“俯身”。因为内义上所论述的主题是这些人如何被虚假侵扰，然后如何经历试探，之后被释放，好叫他们能被引入天堂。<br />但这一节和接下来几节经文的内容有一个教会尚不知道，因此必须揭示的更大秘密。被称为“属灵”的人，是只有心智的理解力部分能重生，意愿部分不能重生的人。因此，在其心智的理解力部分，主植入一个新意愿，这个意愿遵照构成其教会信仰的教义。这些人，也就是说，这类属灵人只有靠主降世才能得救。原因在于，经过天堂的神性，也就是主降临之前的神性人身无法抵达他们那里；因为可以肯定的是，他们教会的教义大多不是真理，因而其意愿中的良善也并非良善（参看<a href="6427.htm">6427</a>节）。由于这些人只有靠主降临才能得救，在此之前他们无法被提入天堂，所以在此期间，他们被保守在低地，就是圣言中被称为“坑”的地方。这些低地四面被有虚假的地狱围困；那时，他们被这些虚假大大侵扰，然而却受到主的保护。但主降世，并将祂自己里面的人身变成神性之后，就释放了那些在那里的坑中之人，把他们提入天堂。祂还通过这些人形成属灵天堂，也就是第二层天堂。这就是主降到低地，释放那些被囚之人所表示的。<br />这就是这一节和接下来几节经文在内义上所描述的大秘密。关于这些属灵人，可参看前面的说明，即：属灵人在信之真理与良善方面处于模糊之中（<a href="2708.htm">2708</a>，<a href="2715.htm">2715</a>，<a href="2718.htm">2718</a>，<a href="2831.htm">2831</a>，<a href="2849.htm">2849</a>，<a href="2935.htm">2935</a>，<a href="2937.htm">2937</a>，<a href="3241.htm">3241</a>，<a href="3833.htm">3833</a>，<a href="6289.htm">6289</a>节）。他们的模糊被主的神性人身光照（<a href="2716.htm">2716</a>，<a href="4402.htm">4402</a>节）。他们因在信之真理与良善方面处于模糊之中，故受到地狱的强烈攻击；但主不断保护他们（<a href="6419.htm">6419</a>节）。属灵人心智的意愿部分不能重生，只有理解力部分能重生；主在理解力部分形成一个新意愿（<a href="863.htm">863</a>，<a href="875.htm">875</a>，<a href="895.htm">895</a>，<a href="927.htm">927</a>，<a href="928.htm">928</a>，<a href="1023.htm">1023</a>，<a href="1043.htm">1043</a>，<a href="1044.htm">1044</a>，<a href="2256.htm">2256</a>，<a href="4328.htm">4328</a>，<a href="4493.htm">4493</a>，<a href="5113.htm">5113</a>节）。属灵人靠主降世得救（<a href="2833.htm">2833</a>，<a href="2834.htm">2834</a>，<a href="3969.htm">3969</a>节）。<br />圣言先知部分的各个地方都提到“被囚的”或“被囚在坑里的”，主解救了他们。被囚的要被提尤表此处所论及的人，如以赛亚书：<br />我耶和华凭公义召你，必拉着你的手，保守你，使你作人民的约，作列族的光，开瞎子的眼，领被囚的出牢狱，领坐黑暗的出监牢。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.6.htm">42:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.7.htm">7</a>）<br /><br />我保守你，使你作人民约，复兴遍地，承受荒凉之地为业；对那些被囚的说，出来吧！对那在黑暗的人说，显露吧！他们在路上必得饮食，他们的牧场在一切小山坡上。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.8.htm">49:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.9.htm">9</a>）<br />这明显论及主。“被囚的”尤表那些滞留在低地，直等主来，那时被提入天堂的人；一般表示所有虽处于良善，却被虚假拖住，仿佛被囚，然而却渴望摆脱它们的人。<br />撒迦利亚书：<br />我因与你立约的血，将你中间被囚的人从坑中释放出来。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚9.11.htm">9:11</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />他们必被聚集，像被囚在坑里的，并要被关在监狱；多日之后便被眷顾。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.22.htm">24:22</a>）<br />“被囚在坑里的”就表示这些人。除此之外，同样的含义可从以赛亚书中的这些话看出来：<br />耶和华用膏了我，叫我传好信息给贫穷的人，差遣我包扎心里破碎的，报告被掳的、被囚的得释放，瞎眼的得看见，报告耶和华的喜年。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛61.1.htm">61:1</a>）<br /><br />在黑暗中行走的百姓看见了大光；住在死荫之地的人有光照耀他们。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.2.htm">9:2</a>）</p>

And I am come down to liberate them out of the hand of the Egyptians. That this signifies that He would let Himself down to them, to set them free from the power of the false memory-knowledges which 
endeavor to destroy the truths of the church, is evident from the signification of "coming down," as being to let Himself down (of which below); from the signification of "to liberate," as being to set 
free, for he who sets free from falsities, liberates; from the signification of "hand," as being power (n. 878, 3387, 3563, 4931-4937, 5544); and from the signification of the "Egyptians," as being 
false memory-knowledges which are contrary to the truths of the church (see n. 6651, 6679, 6683), thus which endeavor to destroy them. As regards the fact that the Lord comes down, the case is this. The 
Lord is said to "come down," or to "let Himself down," when He comes to Judgment (n. 1311); and also when He comes to lower regions, here to those who are of the spiritual church, who are signified 
by the "sons of Israel;" for these are treated of in the internal sense, how they are infested by falsities, and then endure temptations, and afterward are liberated, that they may be introduced into 
heaven.  [2] But in the contents of this and the following verses, in the internal sense, there is a still greater mystery, which is not yet known in the church, and therefore is to be made known. They 
who are called "the spiritual" (who are such as can be regenerated only as to the intellectual part, but not as to the will part, and in whose intellectual part therefore a new will is implanted by 
the Lord, which will is according to the doctrinal things of faith pertaining to their church); these, namely such spiritual men, were saved only by the Lord's coming into the world. The reason is that 
the Divine passing through heaven, which was the Divine Human before the Lord's coming, could not reach them, because the doctrinal things of their church were for the most part not true, and consequently 
the good which is of the will was not good (see n. 6427). As these could be saved only by the coming of the Lord, and thus could not before be raised into heaven, therefore they were meanwhile 
kept in the lower earth, in places there which in the Word are called "pits;" which earth was beset about by the hells where are falsities, by which they were then much infested, and yet were guarded 
by the Lord. But after the Lord came into the world, and made the Human in Himself Divine, then He delivered those who were there in "pits," and raised them to heaven; and out of them He also formed 
the spiritual heaven, which is the second heaven. This is meant by the descent of the Lord to the lower regions, and by the deliverance of those who were bound. [3] This is the mystery which in the 
internal sense is also described in this and the following verses. See what was shown above about these spiritual men, namely: That the spiritual are in obscurity as to the truth and good of faith (n. 
2708, 2715, 2718, 2831, 2849, 2935, 2937, 3241, 3833, 6289): That their obscurity is illumined by the Lord's Divine Human (n. 2716, 4402): That as they are in obscurity as to the truth and good of faith, 
they are very much assaulted by the hells, but that the Lord continually protects them (n. 6419): That the spiritual cannot be regenerated as to the will part, but only as to the intellectual part, 
and a new will is there formed by the Lord (n. 863, 875, 895, 927, 928, 1023, 1043, 1044, 2256, 4328, 4493, 5113): That the spiritual were saved by the coming of the Lord into the world (n. 2833, 2834, 
3969). [4] In the prophetic Word occasional mention is made of the "bound," and of the "bound in the pit," and that they were delivered by the Lord; by whom are specifically meant those who are 
here spoken of, as in these passages: </p>
<p>     I Jehovah have called Thee in righteousness, and will hold Thy hand, because I will keep Thee, and give Thee for a covenant to the people, for a light of the 
nations, to open the blind eyes, to bring out the bound from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house (Isa. 42:6-7).      I kept Thee, and gave Thee for a covenant of the people, 
to restore the land, to divide the wasted heritages; to say to the bound, Go forth, to them that are in darkness, Be ye revealed. They shall feed upon the ways, and on all hillsides is their pasture 
(Isa. 49:8-9); </p>
<p>this is manifestly said of the Lord. Specifically "the bound" denote those who were detained in the lower earth until the Lord's coming, and who were then raised into heaven; and 
in general all those who are in good, and are kept by falsities as it were bound, from which they nevertheless desire to work their way out. [5] Again: </p>
<p>     By the blood of Thy covenant I will send 
forth Thy bound out of the pit (Zech. 9:11).      Gathering they shall be gathered together, the bound in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison; after a multitude of days they shall be visited 
(Isa. 24:22); </p>
<p>"the bound in the pit" denote the same.      Jehovah hath anointed Me to preach good tidings to the poor; He hath sent Me to bind up the brokenhearted, to preach liberty to the captives, 
to the bound, to the blind,* to proclaim the year of Jehovah's good pleasure (Isa. 61:1). The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; they that dwelt the land of the shadow of death, 
upon them hath the light shined (Isa. 9:2). * Oculis capto, literally, "to him that is taken as to his eyes." See n. 2906. [Reviser.] </p>

'And I have come down to deliver them from the hand of the Egyptians' means that He would stoop down to them to release them from the power of false factual knowledge, which tries to destroy the truths 
of the Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'coming down' as stooping down, dealt with below; from the meaning of 'to deliver' as to release, for one who releases people from falsities delivers 
or sets them free; from the meaning of 'the hand' as the power, dealt with in <a href="878.htm">878</a>, <a href="3387.htm">3387</a>, <a href="3563.htm">3563</a>, <a href="4931.htm">4931</a>-<a href="4937.htm">4937</a>, <a href="5544.htm">5544</a>; and from the meaning of 'the Egyptians' as false factual knowledge, which is opposed to 
the Church's truths, dealt with in <a href="6651.htm">6651</a>, <a href="6679.htm">6679</a>, <a href="6683.htm">6683</a>, and so which tries to destroy them. As regards the Lord's coming down, the situation is that the Lord is said to come or stoop down when He comes 
to judgement, <a href="1311.htm">1311</a>, and also when He comes down to lower things, in this instance to those belonging to the spiritual Church, who are meant by 'the children of Israel'. For the subject in the internal 
sense is the way in which those people are molested by falsities, at which time they undergo temptations, and the way in which after that they are set free in order that they may be led into heaven. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
But the contents of the internal sense of this verse and of those that follow hold an even deeper mystery which the Church does not yet know about and which must therefore be disclosed. Those 
who are termed spiritual are people for whom only the understanding part of their mind, not the will part, can be regenerated. In the understanding part of their mind the Lord therefore implants a new 
will, a will which conforms to the teachings that compose the faith of their Church. These people, that is to say, spiritual ones such as these, were saved solely by the Lord's Coming into the world. 
The reason why is that the Divine passing through heaven, which was the Divine Human before the Lord's Coming, could not reach them; for to be sure the teachings of their Church were for the most part 
not truths, and consequently the good in their will was not good either, <a href="6427.htm">6427</a>. Since those people could be saved solely by the Lord's Coming, they could not be raised into heaven before then. They were 
therefore kept in the meantime on the lower earth, in places there which in the Word are called 'pits'. This lower earth was besieged on every side by the hells where there were falsities, by which 
they were molested greatly during that time. In spite of this however the Lord protected them. But after the Lord came into the world and made the Human within Himself Divine, He set free those who 
were in the pits there and raised them to heaven. From these He also formed the spiritual heaven which is the second heaven. This is what is meant by the Lord's descent into the lower parts<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and by His 
deliverance of those who had been bound. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 This is the even deeper mystery that is described in the internal sense of this verse and of those that follow. See what has been shown already regarding 
those who are spiritual,  </p>
<p>The spiritual are in obscurity so far as the truth and good of faith are concerned, <a href="2708.htm">2708</a>, <a href="2715.htm">2715</a>, <a href="2718.htm">2718</a>, <a href="2831.htm">2831</a>, <a href="2849.htm">2849</a>, <a href="2935.htm">2935</a>, <a href="2937.htm">2937</a>, <a href="3241.htm">3241</a>, <a href="3833.htm">3833</a>, <a href="6289.htm">6289</a>. </p>
<p>Their obscurity is lightened 
by the Lord's Divine Human, <a href="2716.htm">2716</a>, <a href="4402.htm">4402</a>.  </p>
<p>Because they are in obscurity so far as the truth and good of faith are concerned they are under strong attack from the hells; but the Lord is constantly 
protecting them, <a href="6419.htm">6419</a>. </p>
<p>Those who are spiritual cannot have the will part of their mind regenerated, only the understanding part; and there the Lord forms a new will, <a href="863.htm">863</a>, <a href="875.htm">875</a>, <a href="895.htm">895</a>, <a href="927.htm">927</a>, <a href="918.htm">918</a>, <a href="1023.htm">1023</a>, <a href="1043.htm">1043</a>, <a href="1044.htm">1044</a>, <a href="2156.htm">2156</a>, <a href="4328.htm">4328</a>, <a href="4493.htm">4493</a>, <a href="5113.htm">5113</a>. </p>

<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Various places in the prophetical part of the Word mention 'the bound' 
or 'the bound in the pit' and the fact that the Lord delivered them. The bound' should be taken to mean specifically those spoken of just above, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I Jehovah have called you in righteousness, 
and will hold your hand, because I will guard you, and give you to be a covenant of the people,<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> a light of the nations, to open the blind eyes, to bring the bound out of prison, out of the 
dungeon-house those who sit in darkness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2042:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 42:6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
I have guarded you, and I have given you as covenant of the people - to restore the land; to share out the devastated 
inheritances; to say to the bound, Go out; to those who are in darkness, Reveal yourselves. They will feed along the ways, and on all slopes will their pasture be. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2049:8,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 49:8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This plainly refers 
to the Lord. 'The bound' stands in particular for those who were held back on the lower earth until the Lord's Coming, when they were raised up to heaven, and in general for all who are governed by 
good, yet are held back as though bound by falsities, from which however they wish to break away.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
Through the blood of your covenant I will let out your bound ones from the pit. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%209:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 9:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
They will surely be gathered together, the bound ones in the pit, and they will be shut up in the dungeon; after a multitude of days they will be visited. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2024:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 24:21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The 
bound ones in the pit' stands for the same people. And in addition to these places the same meaning can be seen from the following words in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah has anointed Me to bring good tidings 
to the poor. He has sent Me to bind up the broken in heart; to preach liberty to captives, to those who are bound, to him who is blind; to proclaim the year of Jehovah's good pleasure. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2061:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 61:1</a>, 
<a href="2.htm">2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere, </p>
<blockquote>
The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; those dwelling in the land of the shadow of death, upon them has the light shone out. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%209:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 9:2</a>.

<p>apud eundem, Custodivi te, et dedi in foedus populi, ad restituendum terram, ad dividendum hereditates devastatas, ad dicendum vinctis, 
Exite, eis qui in tenebris, Revelamini, super viis pascent, et in omnibus clivis pascuum eorum, xlix 8, 9; </p>
<p>ibi manifeste de Domino; `vincti' in specie pro illis qui detenti fuerunt in terra inferiore 
usque ad Adventum Domini, et qui tunc elevati in caelum; in genere pro omnibus qui in bono sunt, et {8}sicut vincti a falsis, e quibus tamen eniti volunt, tenentur: apud Sachariam, 5 Per sanguinem 
foederis tui emittam vinctos quos e fovea, ix 11: </p>
<p>apud Esaiam, Colligendo colligentur vinctus in fovea, et claudentur in claustro, post multitudinem dierum visitabuntur, xxiv 22; </p>
<p>`vincti in fovea' 
pro iisdem: et praeterea, ab his apud Esaiam, Unxit Jehovah Me ad evangelizandum pauperibus, misit Me ad obligandum fractos corde, ad praedicandum captivis libertatem, vinctis, oculis capto, ad proclamandum 
annum beneplaciti Jehovae, lxi 1 [,2]: </p>
<p>et {9}alibi, Populus ambulantes in tenebris, viderunt lucem magnam; habitantes in terra umbrae mortis, lux effulsit super illos, ix 1 [A.V. 2]. 	@1
