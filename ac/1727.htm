<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1727节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1727.</strong>“带着饼”表属天事物和从它们所得来的精神焕发。“酒”表属灵事物和从它们所得来的精神焕发。这从前面论述的“饼”和“酒”的含义清楚可知：“饼”是指属天之物（<a href="276.htm">276</a>，<a href="680.htm">680</a>节）；“酒”，以及“葡萄”和“葡萄园”是指属灵之物（<a href="1069.htm">1069</a>，<a href="1071.htm">1071</a>节）。因为“饼”表属天之物，“酒”表属灵之物，所以它们在圣餐中也成为象征。此处“麦基洗德带着饼和酒”有相同的含义，因为在古教会，“饼”代表一切属天之物，“酒”代表一切属灵之物。故此处它们代表主自己，即一切属天之物和一切属灵之物的源头。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1727.</strong> Brought out bread symbolizes heavenly qualities and the refreshment they provide; and wine symbolizes spiritual qualities and the refreshment they provide. This can be seen from the symbolism of bread as something heavenly (discussed in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1727/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_276" target=_top>276</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1727/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_680" target=_top>680</a>) and that of wine, and of a grapevine or vineyard, as something spiritual (discussed in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1727/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1069" target=_top>1069</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1727/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1071" target=_top>1071</a>). Because bread symbolizes heavenly elements, and wine, spiritual elements, they also became symbols in the Holy Supper.<br />Melchizedek's offer of bread and wine here has a symbolism similar to that of the Holy Supper because in the ancient church bread represented everything heavenly while wine represented everything spiritual. So here they represent the Lord himself, the source of everything heavenly and everything spiritual. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1727</b></p><p><b>1727.</b>
Brought forth bread and wine. That to "bring forth bread" signifies celestial things and refreshment from them, and to "bring forth wine" signifies spiritual things and refreshment from them, is evident 
from the signification of "bread," as being what is celestial (spoken of n. 276, 680); and from the signification of "wine," as also of the "vine" and the "vineyard," as being what is spiritual (explained 
n. 1069, 1071). And because "bread" signifies celestial things, and "wine" spiritual things, they were made symbols also in the Holy Supper. That Melchizedek brought forth bread and wine, has 
here a similar signification; for bread in the Ancient Church was the representative of all celestial things, and wine the representative of all spiritual things; thus here of the Lord Himself, from 
whom is all that is celestial and all that is spiritual. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1727</b></p><p><b>1727.</b>
'He brought out bread' means celestial things and the refreshment received from them, while 'end wine' means spiritual things and the refreshment received from them. This is clear from the meaning of 
'bread' as that which is celestial, dealt with in <a href="276.htm">276</a>, <a href="680.htm">680</a>, and from the meaning of 'wine', and also of a vine and a vineyard, as that which is spiritual, dealt with in <a href="1069.htm">1069</a>, <a href="1071.htm">1071</a>. And because 'breed' 
means celestial things, and 'wine' spiritual, they were also made symbols in the Holy Supper. Here 'Melchizedek brought out bread and wine' has a similar meaning, for in the Ancient Church 'breed' was 
the representative of all celestial things, and 'wine' the representative of all spiritual things. Thus here they are representatives of the Lord Himself, the source of everything celestial and everything 
spiritual. </p>

</p><b>1727.</b>
'Eduxit panem': quod significet caelestia, et recreationem inde, 'et vinum' quod significet spiritualia et recreationem inde, constat ex significatione 'panis' quod sit caeleste, de qua n. 276, 68), 
et a significatione 'vini,' tum vitis et vineae, quod sit spirituale, de qua n. 1069, 1071; et quia 'panis' significat caelestia, et 'vinum' spiritualia, etiam symbola in Sacra Cena facta sunt: hic 'quod 
Malkizedech produxerit panem et vinum' simile significat, quia 'panis' in Antiqua Ecclesia fuit repraesentativum omnium caelestium, et 'vinum' repraesentativum omnium spiritualium, ita hic Ipsius 
Domini a Quo omne caeleste et omne spirituale. </p>
