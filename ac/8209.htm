<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8209节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8209.</strong>“跟在他们后头”表流入的企图。这从“跟在某人后头”的含义清楚可知，当论及那些沉浸于邪恶所生的虚假之人时，“跟在某人后头”是指通过邪恶所生虚假的流注施暴的企图（参看<a href="8187.htm">8187</a>节）。它之所以是指一种企图，是因为地狱的魔鬼和灵人无法对善人造成伤害，然而仍不断企图这样做。有一个气场从地狱发出，可称作努力的气场；这是一个作恶的气场。我有好几次被允许觉察这个气场。所流入的努力不断存在，并且一有机会就会实际爆发出来。不过，这个气场被来自主的一个天堂的努力气场所抵消；这是一个行善的气场，该气场拥有一切能力在里面，因为它源于神性。<br />然而，在这些截然对立的努力之间保持着平衡，旨在让一个人可以处于自由之中，从而拥有选择的自由，还旨在叫他能得以改造；因为一切改造都在自由中发生，没有自由，就没有改造。属灵的努力和意愿是一样的。在人被改造期间，他被保持在意愿良善和意愿邪恶之间的平衡，也就是自由之中。这时，他越接近意愿良善，就越接近天堂，远离地狱；这时他从主所获得的新意愿也越来越战胜他通过父母的遗传和后来通过实际生活所获得的自己的意愿。因此，当一个人的改造发展这种程度，以致他意愿良善，并对它拥有一种情感时，良善就会移除邪恶，因为主存在于这良善里面；事实上，良善来源于主，因而属于主，其实就是主自己。由此可见在人那里的流注的努力是怎么回事。</p>

And came after them. That this signifies the endeavor of the influx, is evident from the signification of "to come after" anyone, when said of those who are in falsities from evil, as being an endeavor 
to inflict violence by means of an influx of falsity from evil (see n. 8187). It denotes an endeavor, because infernal genii and spirits cannot inflict evil on the good, but nevertheless constantly 
endeavor to do so. There is a sphere exhaling from the hells which may be called a sphere of endeavors, and which is a sphere of doing evil. I have several times been allowed to perceive this sphere. 
The endeavor in it is constant, and as soon as any opportunity offers, the effect breaks forth from it. But this sphere is restrained by the sphere of the endeavors of heaven which is from the Lord, 
and is a sphere of imparting benefits, in which is all power, because it is from the Divine. Nevertheless equilibrium is maintained between these diametrically opposite endeavors, to the intent that man 
may be in freedom, and thus in choice, and that he can be reformed; for all reformation is in freedom, and without freedom there is no reformation. Spiritual endeavor is the same as will. During man's 
reformation he is kept in equilibrium (that is, in freedom) between willing good and willing evil; and insofar as he then accedes to willing what is good, so far he accedes to heaven and recedes from 
hell; and so far the new will which he then receives from the Lord prevails against his own will which he received by inheritance from his parents and afterward by actual life. When therefore a man 
has been so far reformed that he wills good and is affected with it, then good removes evil, because the Lord is present in good; for good is from the Lord, thus it is His, nay, it is Himself. From 
all this it can be seen how the case is with the endeavor of the influxes with man. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8209</b></p><p><b>8209.</b>
'And came after them' means the attempt to flow in. This is clear from the meaning of 'coming after someone', when done by those steeped in falsities arising from evil, as the attempt to do violence 
by flowing in with falsity arising from evil, dealt with in <a href="8187.htm">8187</a>. The reason why it is an attempt is that genii and spirits belonging to hell cannot inflict ill on the good, yet are nevertheless constantly 
attempting to do so. There is a sphere emanating from the hells, which may be called a sphere of endeavours; this is a sphere of doing ill. I have also been allowed sometimes to perceive this sphere. 
That attempt to flow in exists constantly, and is actualized the moment any opportunity presents itself. But that sphere is counteracted by a sphere of endeavours by heaven, which emanates from 
the Lord; this is a sphere of doing good, which has all power within it since it has a Divine origin. </p>

 Nevertheless equilibrium is maintained between those diametrically opposed types of endeavour, 
to the end that a person may be in freedom and so have freedom to choose, and to the end that he may be able to be reformed; for all reformation takes place in freedom, and no reformation without 
it. Spiritually, attempting something is the same as willing it. While a person is being reformed he is kept in a state of equilibrium, that is, in freedom between willing good and willing evil. The closer 
he moves at this time towards willing good, the closer he moves to heaven and the further away from hell. His new will, acquired at this time from the Lord, also comes more and more to prevail over 
the will properly his own, which he acquired by heredity from his parents and then through his own actions in life. When therefore a person's reformation has progressed so far that he wills good and 
has an affection for it, good removes evil, since the Lord is present within that good. For good has its origin in the Lord, and so is the Lord's, indeed is the Lord. From all this one may see what 
the situation is so far as the things attempting to flow into him are concerned. </p>

`Et venerunt post illos': quod significet conatum influxus, constat ex significatione `venire post aliquem,' cum de illis qui in falsis ex malo, quod sit conatus inferendi violentiam per influxum falsi 
ex malo, de qua n. 8187; quod sit conatus, est quia infernales genii et spiritus inferre bonis malum nequeunt, sed usque perpetuo conantur; est sphaera quae ab infernis exhalat, quae vocari potest 
sphaera conatuum, quae est malefaciendi; hanc sphaeram etiam aliquoties percipere datum est; conatus ille est perpetuus, ac ut primum aliquid copiae datur, {1}erumpit inde effectus; sed illa sphaera 
inhibetur a sphaera conatuum caeli, quae a Domino, quae est benefaciendi, cui, quia a Divino, inest omnis potentia. 	2 Usque tamen inter conatus illos sibi e diametro oppositos tenetur aequilibrium, 
ob causam ut homo in libero sit et sic in electione, utque reformari queat, nam in libero omnis reformatio, et absque libero nulla.  Conatus spiritualis est idem ac voluntas; cum reformatur homo, tenetur 
ille in aequilibrio, hoc est, in libero inter velle bonum et velle malum, et quantum tunc accedit ad velle bonum, tantum accedit ad caelum et recedit ab inferno; et tantum novum voluntarium, quod 
tunc accipit a Domino, praevalet contra proprium voluntarium, quod accepit per hereditatem a parentibus et dein per actualem vitam; cum itaque homo tantum reformatus est ut velit bonum et afficiatur illo, 
tunc bonum removet malum, quia Dominus in bono est praesens; est enim bonum a Domino, ita est Ipsius, immo est Ipse.  Ex his constare potest quomodo se habet cum conatu influxuum apud hominem. 	@1 
d erumpit in effectu i fit inde effectus$ </p>
