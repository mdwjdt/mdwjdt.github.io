Verses 1-15. And it was in the evening that the quail* came up, and covered the camp; and in the morning there was a deposit of dew round about the camp. And the deposit of dew went up, and behold upon 
the faces of the wilderness a small round thing, small as the hoar frost upon the earth. And the sons of Israel saw, and they said a man to his brother, What is this [Man hoc]? for they knew not what 
it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which Jehovah hath given you to eat. "And it was in the evening," signifies the end of the state; "that the quail came up," signifies natural delight 
through which is good; "and covered the camp," signifies that it filled the natural of the man; "and in the morning," signifies the beginning of a new state; "there was a deposit of dew round about 
the camp," signifies the truth of peace adjoining itself; "and the deposit of dew went up," signifies the insinuation of truth; "and behold upon the faces of the wilderness," signifies a new will part; 
"a small round thing," signifies the good of truth in the first formation; "small as the hoar frost upon the earth," signifies truth in the form of good consistent and flowing; "and the sons of Israel 
saw," signifies a perception; "and they said a man to his brother," signifies amazement; "What is this? for they knew not what it was," signifies at what was not known; "and Moses said unto them," 
signifies information through truth from the Divine; "This is the bread which Jehovah hath given you to eat," signifies that this is the good which must be appropriated and make their life, in the 
supreme sense that this is the Lord in you. *  Swedenborg retains the Hebrew word selav, untranslated. [REVISER] </p>

Vers. 13-15.  Et factum in vespera, et ascendit selav, et obtexit castra; et in matuta fuit positio roris circum castra.  Et desiit positio roris, et ecce super facies deserti minutum rotundum, minutum
