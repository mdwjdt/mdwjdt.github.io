<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1880节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1880.</strong> 补充说明：<br />关于总体上的灵人和天使。他们全都是肉体死后继续活着的人类灵魂，在此我可以说，他们的感觉比世人的敏锐得多，如视觉、听觉、嗅觉和触觉，但没有味觉。然而，灵人，尤其天使不能用自己的视觉，也就是灵的视觉看到世上的任何事物。因为尘世之光，或阳光在他们看来如同浓密的黑暗。就象世人无法通过自己的视觉，即肉体视觉看到来世之物一样，因为天堂之光，或主的天堂之光在世人看来也如同浓密的黑暗。<br />尽管如此，若主乐意，灵人和天使仍能透过人的肉眼看到这个世界。不过，主不会允许这种事发生在任何人身上，除非祂使此人与灵人并天使对话，与他们在一起。灵人和天使被允许透过我的眼睛看到这个世界的事物，就象我自己看到它们一样清楚，还被允许听到世人与我的谈话。有时，一些灵人通过我看到他们在世时的朋友，就和以前看到他们一样，他们对此目瞪口呆。一些灵人还看到自己的配偶及其子女，并渴望我告诉他们，他们近在咫尺，正看着他们，还让我转告他们在来世的情况。但我被禁止告诉他们，或向他们透露，他们以这种方式被看到。这部分是因为他们会说我疯了，或将这类事视为精神错乱的幻觉。我十分清楚，尽管他们嘴上会承认，但内心其实并不相信灵人的存在，或死人会复活。<br />当我的内视第一次被打开，灵人和天使透过我的眼睛看到这个世界及其中的事物时，他们如此震惊，以至于声称这是奇迹中的奇迹。他们充满新的喜乐，因为地与天，以及天与地的沟通以这种方式被开启。这种快乐持续了数月，不过，后来它变得司空见惯，如今他们一点也不感到奇怪了。我得知，与其他人同在的灵人和天使根本看不到这个世界的事物，只能觉察到与其同在之人的思维和情感。<br />这些事表明，人如此受造，以便他既能在地上生活在世人当中，同时也能在天上生活在天使当中，反之亦然。这是为了天与地能共存，并行如一体，世人能知道天上所发生的一切，而天使也能知道地上所发生的一切，因此当世人离世时，他们能相应地从主在地上的国度进入主在天上的国度，不是如同进入另一个国度，而是如同进入他们活在肉身时所在的那个国度。但由于人变得如此物质和肉体化，所以他自己关闭了天堂。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1880.</strong> Furthermore, to speak generally of spirits and angels, who are all human souls living on after the death of their body, they have much sharper senses than people do: sight, hearing, smell, and touch, but not taste.{*1} However, it is impossible for spirits (much less angels) to see anything in this world by their power of sight, or in other words, by the eyes of their spirit. To them the light of the world, or of the sun, is like thick darkness. By the same token, it is impossible for us to see anything in the other world by our power of sight, or in other words, with the eyes of our body. To us the light of heaven, or of heaven's Lord, is like thick darkness.<br />[2] Still, when it pleases the Lord, spirits and angels can see objects in the world through the eyes of a person on earth. This is an experience the Lord does not grant except to a person whom he allows to speak with spirits and angels and to associate with them. Through my eyes they were allowed to see objects in the world, and to see them as clearly as I did. They were also allowed to hear people talking with me. More than once a few of them saw friends they had had during bodily life. Looking through my eyes, they saw these people just as close at hand as before, and it stupefied them. They also saw their spouses and little children and wanted me to tell their loved ones they were present and could see them, and to relay how matters stood for them in the other world. But I was forbidden to talk to these people and reveal that they were being watched in this way. Besides, they would have called me crazy or believed me to be hallucinating, because I knew that although they would pay lip service to the idea that spirits exist and the dead have risen again, they would not believe it in their hearts.<br />[3] When my inner sight first opened, and they saw the world and all that is in it through my eyes, spirits and angels were so dumbfounded that they called it the miracle of miracles. They were moved by a new kind of joy at the thought that earth would have this kind of contact with heaven, and heaven with earth. This pleasure lasted several months, but now that the experience has grown familiar, they no longer marvel at all.<br />I was taught that the spirits and angels present with other people do not see anything in the world at all but only pick up on the thoughts and feelings of those they are with.<br />[4] These experiences established the idea that we were created to live in heaven among the angels at the same time as we are living on the earth among people, and vice versa. If that happened, heaven and earth would come together and form a single whole. We would know what was going on in heaven, and angels would know what was going on in the world. When we died, we would then be crossing over from the Lord's kingdom on earth to the Lord's kingdom in the heavens. It would not be as though we were passing into a different kingdom but into the same one we inhabited while we were living in our body. Instead we have become so body-oriented that we have shut heaven off from ourselves.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the sense of taste in the spiritual world, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1880/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1516" target=_top>1516</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1880/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1521" target=_top>1521</a>.

As regards spirits and angels in general, who all are human souls living after the death of the body, I may say here that they have much more exquisite senses than men-that is, sight, hearing, smell, 
and touch-but not taste. Spirits however are not able, and angels are still less able, to see anything that is in the world by their own sight, that is, by the sight of the spirit; for the light of the 
world or of the sun is to them as thick darkness; just in the same way as man by his sight, that is, by the sight of the body, cannot see anything that is in the other life; for the light of heaven, 
or the Lord's heavenly light, is to man as thick darkness.  [2] But still when the Lord pleases, spirits and angels can see the things in this world through the eyes of a man. But the Lord does not 
grant this except in the case of one whom He enables to speak with spirits and angels, and to be together with them. Spirits and angels have been permitted to see the things in this world through my 
eyes as plainly as I could see them myself, and also to hear men talking with me. It has sometimes happened that to their great astonishment, some through me have seen their friends whom they had had 
in the life of the body, just as they had seen them before. Some have also seen their married partners, and their children, and have desired me to tell them that they were close by and saw them, and to 
give an account of their state in the other life, but I had been forbidden to tell them or reveal to them that they were seen in this way, and this partly for the reason that they would have called 
me insane, or would have thought such things to be delirious fancies of the mind; for I was well aware that although they would acknowledge it with the lips, they did not believe in heart in the existence 
of spirits, or that the dead are risen.  [3] When my interior sight was first opened, and through my eyes spirits and angels saw the world and the things that are in it, they were so amazed that 
they called it the miracle of miracles; and they were affected with a new joy, in that in this way communication was opened of earth with heaven, and of heaven with earth. This delight lasted for months, 
but afterwards it became familiar, and now they do not wonder at all. I have been instructed that the spirits and angels who are present with other men do not in the slightest degree see the things 
of this world, but only perceive the thoughts and affections of those with whom they are.  [4] These things have shown that man was so created that while living on earth among men, he might at the 
same time also live in heaven among angels, and the converse; so that heaven and earth might be together, and might act as a one, and that men might know what is going on in heaven, and angels what in 
the world; and therefore that when men depart this life they would pass from the Lord's kingdom on earth into the Lord's kingdom in the heavens, not as into another kingdom, but as into the same as 
that in which they had been when living in the body. But in consequence of man's becoming so corporeal, he has closed heaven against himself.  </p>

Additional Remarks - </p>
<p> As regards spirits and angels in general, all of whom are the souls of people living on after the death of the body, they possess far more perfect sensory powers than men, that 
is, the powers of sight, hearing, smell, and touch, but not of taste. Spirits however are not able, and angels are even less able, to see anything whatever in the world with their sight, that is, with 
the sight of the spirit. For the light of the world, or of the sun, is to them as pitch darkness, just as man cannot with his sight, that is, with the sight of the body, see anything whatever in the 
next life; for to him the light of heaven, or the Lord's heavenly light, is as pitch darkness. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Nevertheless, when it pleases the Lord, spirits and angels are able to see the things that exist 
in the world through the eyes of one in the world, though the Lord does not allow such a thing to happen with anyone except someone for whom the Lord makes it possible to converse with spirits and angels, 
and to be together with them. Through my own eyes they have been allowed to see the things that are in the world, and to see them as plainly as I myself saw them, and also to hear the people talking 
to me. On occasions it has come about that through me some have seen their friends whom they had had during their lifetime, as present then as formerly; and at this they have been dumbfounded. They 
have also seen their married partners and their children, and have wished me to tell them that they were present and could see them, and to report about their state in the next life. But I was forbidden 
to tell this to them and to reveal to them that they were seen as described, the reason for this being that they would have said I was insane or would have thought that such reports were delirious 
wanderings of the mind. For I knew very well that although they would say with their lips that spirits exist and that the dead have risen, they would still not believe it in their hearts. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 When 
my interior sight was first opened and through my eyes they saw the world and what was in it, spirits and angels were so astonished that they said it was the greatest miracle of all time, and a new 
found joy entered into them that in this way a communication now existed of earth with heaven, and of heaven with earth. This delight lasted for several months, but after that it became commonplace, 
and now they do not wonder at it at all. I have been informed that spirits and angels present with other people do not see anything at all of things in the world, but merely perceive the thoughts and 
affections of those with whom they are present. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 From these considerations it has become clear that man was created in such a way that while living on earth among men he might live at the same time 
in heaven among angels, and vice versa. He was so created that heaven and earth might co-exist and act as one, with men knowing what was going on in heaven and angels what was going on in the world. 
And when they departed the earthly life men might accordingly pass from the Lord's kingdom on earth into the Lord's kingdom in the heavens, passing not as into a different kingdom, but as into the 
same one in which they had been when they lived in the body. But because man has become so bodily-minded he has closed heaven against himself. </p>

Praeterea, quod in genere spiritus et angelos attinet qui omnes sunt animae hominum viventes post mortem corporis, multo exquisitiores sensus habent quam homines, nempe visum, auditum, olfactum et tactum, 
non autem gustum.  Sed spiritus non possunt, minus adhuc angeli, suo visu, hoc est, visu spiritus, videre quicquam quod in mundo; illis enim lux mundi seu solaris est velut densa caligo; sicut 
homo suo visu, hoc est, visu corporis, nec videre potest quicquam quod in altera vita, ei enim lux caeli, seu caelestis Domini, est velut densa caligo.  [2] Sed usque spiritus et angeli quando Domino 
beneplacet, possunt videre illa quae in mundo, per oculos hominis, sed hoc non concedit Dominus apud alium quam cui dat Dominus loqui cum spiritibus et angelis, et esse simul cum illis; per meos oculos 
datum est illis videre illa quae in mundo, et tam manifeste sicut ego, tum etiam audire homines mecum loquentes; contigit aliquoties quod aliqui amicos suos quos habuerunt in vita corporis, per me viderint 
ita praesentes prorsus sicut prius, et obstupefacti; viderunt etiam suos maritos et infantes, et voluerunt ut dicerem illis quod adessent et viderent eos, utque referrem de eorum statu in altera 
vita; sed dicere illis et revelare quod sic visi, mihi interdictum erat, etiam ex ea causa quod dixissent me insanire, aut cogitavissent deliria animi esse, quia notum mihi fuit quod tametsi ore dicerent, 
usque corde non crederent, dari spiritus, et mortuos resurrexisse.  [3] Quando primum apertus mihi fuit visus interior, et per oculos meos viderunt mundum, et quae in mundo essent, spiritus et 
angeli ita obstupefacti sunt ut dicerent hoc miraculum miraculorum esse, et affecti sunt novo gaudio, quod sic communicatio daretur terrae cum caelo, et caeli cum terra; ast haec delectatio persistebat 
per menses, sed postquam familiare factum, nunc nihil mirantur. Instructus sum quod spiritus et angeli apud alios homines ne hilum videant quae in mundo, sed modo percipiant cogitationes et affectiones 
eorum apud quos sunt.  Ex his constare potuit quod homo ita creatus sit ut cum vivit in terra inter homines, simul etiam viveret in caelo inter angelos, et vicissim; sic ut caelum et terra simul 
essent et unum agerent, et scirent homines quid in caelo, et angeli quid in mundo; et cum decedunt, transirent sic a regno Domini in terris in regnum Domini in caelis, non sicut in aliud, sed sicut in 
idem in quo fuerunt cum vixerunt in corpore; sed quia homo ita corporeus factus est, sibi caelum clausit. </p>
