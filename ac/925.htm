<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>925.</strong>“耶和华闻了那安息的气味”表源于仁和仁之信的敬拜，即前一节“燔祭”所表示的敬拜讨主喜悦。在圣言中，经上常说耶和华“闻了那安息的气味”，尤其来自“燔祭”的，这句经文通常表蒙悦纳之物。如祂从燔祭（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.18.htm">29:18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.25.htm">25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.41.htm">41</a>；利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利1.9.htm">1:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利1.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利1.17.htm">17</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利33.12.htm">33:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利33.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利33.18.htm">18</a>；民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.6.htm">28:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.8.htm">8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.13.htm">13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.2.htm">29:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.6.htm">6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.8.htm">8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.36.htm">36</a>）和其它祭物（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利2.2.htm">2:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利2.9.htm">9</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利6.15.htm">6:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利6.21.htm">21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利8.21.htm">8:21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利8.28.htm">28</a>；民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.3.htm">15:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.13.htm">13</a>）那里“闻了那安息的气味”。它们还被称为“献给耶和华为安息之气味的火祭”，以此表示它们源于爱和仁。在圣言中，“火”和“火祭”用来论及主和对祂的敬拜时，表爱。“食物”也是如此，因此缘故，用“燔祭”和“祭物”来进行的代表性敬拜被称为“作为安息之气味的火祭的食物”（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利3.11.htm">3:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利3.16.htm">16</a>）。<br />“气味”表蒙悦纳之物，因此，在犹太教会中，一种气味就是感恩和归于耶和华或主之物的一个代表。其原因在于，仁之善和源于仁的信之真对应于香甜宜人的气味。这种对应关系及其性质从天堂中精灵和天使的气场清楚可知，那里的气场是爱和信的气场，可明显被感知到。这些气场乃是这样：当一个善灵、天使，或一个善灵、天使的社群靠近时，只要主乐意，这个精灵、天使或社群在爱和信方面的品质能立刻被感知到，即便在远处，近在咫尺时感觉更明显。这虽令人难以相信，但却千真万确。这就是来生的交流方式，这就是感知。因此，若主乐意，没有必要千方百计探究一个灵魂或精灵的品质，因为他一靠近就能得知。世上气味的气场就对应于这些气场。它们有这样的对应关系，明显从以下事实看出来，即只要主乐意，爱和信的气场会在精灵界被转化为香甜宜人的气味气场，并明显被感知到。<br />综上所述，清楚可知：“安息的气味”表蒙悦纳之物从何而来且是为何，为何在犹太教会中，气味具有代表性，为何此处“安息的气味”归因于耶和华或主。平安作为复合物，包含了主之国的所有事物，无论总体还是细节，因为主之国的状态是平安的状态。从对主的爱和信所流出的一切幸福状态都出现在平安的状态中。现在所说的一切不仅表明代表的本质，还表明为何犹太教会有隔着幔子的焚香坛，以及施恩座，又为何那么多的香料用于焚香、乳香和膏油，因而表明在圣言中，“安息的气味”、“焚香”和“乳香”分别表示什么，即表爱的属天之物和由此而来的属灵之物，一般表源于爱和信的一切令人愉悦之物。<br />如以西结书：<br />主耶和华说，在我的圣山，就是以色列高处的山，以色列全家，那陆地所有的人，都要事奉我；我要在那里悦纳他们，向你们要供物和作为礼物的初产，并一切的圣物。我必通过那安息的气味悦纳你们。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结20.40.htm">20:40</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结20.41.htm">41</a>）<br />此处“安息的气味”是指燔祭和礼物，即源于仁及其信的敬拜，这敬拜用燔祭和礼物来表示，因而是蒙悦纳的，蒙悦纳用“气味”来表示。阿摩司书：<br />我恨恶、我鄙视你们的节期，我不闻你们圣节会中的气味。你们虽然向我献燔祭和礼物，它们却不蒙悦纳。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩5.21.htm">5:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩5.22.htm">22</a>）<br />这明显表蒙悦纳之物。论到以撒祝福雅各而非以扫，经上说：<br />雅各就上前，以撒吻了他。他父亲一闻他衣服上的气味，就给他祝福说，看哪，我儿的气味如同耶和华赐福之田地的气味一样。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创27.27.htm">27:27</a>）<br />“他衣服上的气味”表属世的善与真，其宜人源于它们与属天、属灵的善与真和谐一致，用“田地的气味”来描述。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]925.</strong> Jehovah smelled a restful smell means that worship rising out of those things — in other words, worship inspired by charity and by the faith that comes of charity, as symbolized by the burnt offering — was pleasing to the Lord. This meaning was mentioned at the previous verse [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_925/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_922#subsection-2-2" target=_top>922:2-3</a>].<br />The Word often says that Jehovah smelled a restful smell, chiefly from burnt offerings, and in each of those places it symbolizes something pleasing or welcome.

Both are referred to as fire offerings that served as a restful smell for Jehovah, meaning that love and charity were the source. In the Word, fire and fire offerings associated with the Lord and with worship of him symbolize love.<br />Bread has a similar meaning, so that representative worship employing burnt offerings and sacrifices is also called the bread of a fire offering to Jehovah that served as a restful smell (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_925/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_3_11" target=_top>Leviticus 3:11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_925/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_3_16" target=_top>16</a>).<br />[2] A smell symbolizes something pleasing and welcome, as a result of which the Jewish religion also used it to represent something pleasing and attributed the smelling of it to Jehovah, or the Lord. This is because the good embraced by charity and the truth espoused by a faith that stems from charity correspond to pleasant, agreeable smells.<br />Auras in the heaven of spirits and angels can demonstrate that this correspondence does exist and can show what its nature is like. In that world, auras of love and faith exist, and the inhabitants perceive them distinctly. The auras are such that when a good spirit or an angel or a community of good spirits or angels comes on the scene, others immediately discern (if the Lord pleases) what kind of love and faith the spirit, angel, or community has. They can tell this from a distance, and the perception grows stronger at close quarters. It is incredible yet absolutely true: this is how communication and perception in the other life work. When the Lord pleases, then, there is no need to probe extensively to find out what a soul or spirit is like, since it can be recognized at the person's first approach.<br />These auras have their counterpart in earthly aromas. The correspondence between the two is clear from this, that in the world of spirits, when it pleases the Lord, auras of love and faith are manifestly embodied in clouds of sweet, pleasant fragrances and are manifestly perceived there.<br />[3] This explains why a restful smell symbolizes something pleasing, why the Jewish religion came to use fragrances in a representative way, and why they saw Jehovah, or the Lord, as sensing the restful smell.<br />A restful smell is a peaceful smell, or in other words, the pleasing quality of peace. Peace enfolds in a single embrace each and every facet of the Lord's kingdom, because the state of the Lord's kingdom is a state of peace. All the happy states that result from love for the Lord and faith in him emerge in a state of peace.<br />What has just been said shows not only how the case stands with representative worship but also why the Jewish religion used incense, for which an altar was provided in front of the veil and the appeasement cover [of the ark]. The same discussion shows why offerings of frankincense had a place among their sacrifices, and also why they used so many fragrant extracts in their incense, frankincense, and anointing oil. So it demonstrates that in the Word a restful odor, the burning of incense, and perfumes all symbolize the heavenly characteristics of love, and the spiritual characteristics of faith derived from them — in general, anything pleasing that develops out of them.<br />[4] In Ezekiel, for example:<br />On my holy mountain, on the mountain of Israel's high ground, there all the house of Israel — the whole of that house in the land — will serve me; there I will accept them. And there I will seek your raised offerings and the first fruits of your gifts in all your consecrations; because of the restful smell I will accept you. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_925/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_20_40-41" target=_top>Ezekiel 20:40-41</a>)<br />The restful smell applies to the burnt offerings and gifts, that is, to worship inspired by charity and the faith that comes of charity, this worship being what the burnt offerings and gifts symbolize. Such worship is accordingly "accepted," which is what the scent means. In Amos:<br />I have hated, I have spurned your feasts, and I will not smell [the incense of] your holidays,{*1} because if you offer me your burnt offerings and gifts, they will not be accepted. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_925/bible_king-james-version_amos_5_21-22" target=_top>Amos 5:21-22</a>)<br />Here the smell explicitly means something pleasing or acceptable. Of Isaac's blessing on Jacob instead of Esau we read:<br />When Jacob had stepped close, and Isaac had kissed him and smelled the smell of his clothes, he blessed him and said, "See: the smell of my son, like the smell of a field that Jehovah has blessed." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_925/bible_king-james-version_genesis_27_26-27" target=_top>Genesis 27:26-27</a>)<br />The smell of the clothing symbolizes earthly goodness and truth, which is pleasing because it harmonizes with heavenly and spiritual goodness and truth. Its pleasing quality is expressed as the smell of a field.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The Latin phrase translated "I will not smell ... your holidays" is non odorabor cessationes vestras. Its exact meaning is subject to conjecture, and it is worth noting that the conventional understanding of the passage from Amos is quite different. The Hebrew verb represented by the Latin odorabor and the English "smell" is in this Bible passage generally taken by scholars in the metaphorical sense of "delight in." The Hebrew represented by the Latin cessationes and the English "holidays" may also mean "assemblies." For these reasons, the phrase as a whole usually appears in English Bibles as something like "I will not delight in your assemblies." [LHC] </p>

And Jehovah smelled an odor of rest. That this signifies that worship therefrom was grateful to the Lord, that is, worship from charity and the faith of charity, which is signified by "burnt-offering" 
has been stated under the preceding verse. It is often said in the Word that Jehovah "smelled an odor of rest" especially from burnt-offerings; and this always means what is grateful or acceptable; 
as that He "smelled an odor of rest" from burnt-offerings (Exod. 29:18, 25, 41; Lev. 1:9, 13, 17; 33:12, 13, 18; Num. 28:6, 8, 13; 29:2, 6, 8, 13, 36), and also from other sacrifices (Lev. 2:2, 9; 6:15, 
21, 8:21, 28; Num. 15:3, 7, 13). They are also called "made by fire for an odor of rest unto Jehovah" by which is signified that they are from love and charity. "Fire" in the Word and "made by fire" 
when predicated of the Lord and of the worship of Him, signifies love. So also does "bread" and for this reason representative worship by burnt-offerings and sacrifices is called "the bread of the offering 
made by fire for an odor of rest" (Lev. 3:11, 16).  [2] That an "odor" signifies what is grateful and acceptable, and thus that an odor in the Jewish Church was a representative of what is grateful, 
and is ascribed to Jehovah or the Lord, is because the good of charity and the truth of faith from charity correspond to sweet and delightful odors. The fact of this correspondence and the nature 
of it is demonstrable from the spheres of spirits and angels in heaven, where there are spheres of love and faith which are plainly perceived. The spheres are such that when a good spirit or angel, 
or a society of good spirits or of angels, comes near, then, whenever the Lord pleases, it is at once perceived, even at a distance, but more sensibly on a nearer approach, what is the quality in respect 
to love and faith of that spirit, angel, or society. This is incredible, yet is perfectly true. Such is the communication in the other life, and such is the perception. Wherefore, when it pleases 
the Lord, there is no need to explore in many ways the quality of a soul or spirit; for it may be known at his first approach. To these spheres correspond the spheres of odors in the world. That they 
do so correspond is evident from the fact that when it pleases the Lord the spheres of love and faith in the world of spirits are turned into spheres of sweet and pleasing odors, and are plainly perceived. 
 [3] From these things it is now evident whence and why "an odor of rest" signifies what is grateful, and why an odor became representative in the Jewish Church, and why "an odor of rest" is 
here ascribed to Jehovah or the Lord. An odor of rest is one of peace, or a grateful sense of peace. Peace taken in the complex embraces all things of the Lord's kingdom both in general and in particular, 
for the state of the Lord's kingdom is a state of peace, and in a state of peace there come forth all the happy states that result from love and faith in the Lord. From what has now been said it 
is plain not only how it is with representatives, but also why in the Jewish Church incense was used, for which there was an altar before the veil and the mercy-seat; why there were offerings of frankincense 
in the sacrifices; also why so many spices were used in the incense, in the frankincense, and in the oil for anointing; and thus what is signified in the Word by "an odor of rest" "incense" and 
"spices" namely, the celestial things of love and the spiritual things of faith therefrom; in general, whatever is grateful from love and faith.  [4] As in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     In the mountain of My holiness, 
in the mountain of the height of Israel, there shall all the house of Israel in the whole land serve Me; there will I accept them, and there will I seek your oblations and the first fruits of your 
gifts, with all your holy things; as an odor of rest will I accept you (Ezek. 20:40-41). Here "an odor of rest" is predicated of burnt-offerings and gifts, that is, of worship from charity and its 
faith, which is signified by the burnt-offerings and gifts, and is consequently acceptable, which is meant by the "odor." In Amos: </p>
<p>     I hate, I have rejected your feasts, and I will not receive the 
odor of your holidays, for if ye shall offer Me your burnt-offerings and gifts, they shall not be acceptable (Amos 5:21-22). Here "odor" manifestly signifies what is grateful or acceptable. Of Isaac 
when blessing Jacob instead of Esau it is said: </p>
<p>     And Jacob came near, and he kissed him; and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell 
of a field which Jehovah hath blessed (Gen. 27:27). The "smell of his raiment" signifies natural good and truth, which is grateful from its agreement with celestial and spiritual good and truth, 
the gratefulness of which is described by the "smell of a field." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 925</b></p><p><b>925.</b>
'Jehovah smelled an odour of rest' means that worship stemming from these was pleasing to the Lord, that is to say, worship stemming from charity and from faith deriving from charity, meant by 'a burnt 
offering', as stated in the previous verse. In various places in the Word it is said that 'Jehovah smelled an odour of rest', especially that from burnt offerings, and wherever this occurs that which 
is pleasing or acceptable is meant. For references to His smelling an odour of rest from burnt offerings, see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2029:18,%2025,%2041&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 29:18, 25, 41</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%201:9,%2013,%2017;%2023:12,%2013,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 1:9, 13, 17; 23:12, 13, 18</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2028:6,%208,%2013;%2029:2,%206,%208,%2013,%2036&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 28:6, 8, 13; 29:2, 6, 8, 13, 36</a>; also from other sacrifices, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%202:2,%209;%206:15,%2021;%208:21,%2028&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 2:2, 9; 6:15, 21; 8:21, 28</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2015:3,%207,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 15:3, 7, 13</a>. They are also called 'that which has been made by fire as an odour of rest to Jehovah' which means that it stems from 
love and charity. In the Word when 'fire' or 'made by fire' is used in reference to the Lord and to worship of Him, it means love. And the same applies to 'bread', which also is why representative worship 
by means of burnt offerings and sacrifices is called 'bread offered by fire to Jehovah as an odour of rest', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%203:11,%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 3:11, 16</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why 'an odour' means that which is pleasing and acceptable, 
and so why in the Jewish Church an odour was also representative of that which is pleasing and is ascribed to Jehovah or the Lord, is that good stemming from charity, and the truth of faith 
deriving from charity, correspond to sweet and pleasant odours. What the correspondence itself is and the character of it becomes clear from the spheres in heaven which surround spirits and angels. The 
spheres there are spheres of love and faith, and are clearly perceived. These spheres are such that when a good spirit or angel, that is, a community of good spirits or angels, approaches, the nature 
of the spirit or angel - that is, of the community - as regards love and faith is, as often as the Lord pleases, instantly perceived. It is perceived even when they are a long way off, more so still 
when they are closer at hand. This is unbelievable but nevertheless perfectly true. Such is the communication in the next life, and such the perception. Consequently, when the Lord pleases there is no 
necessity to make extensive enquiries to discover the character of a soul or spirit, for it is recognizable the moment he approaches. It is to these spheres that spheres belonging to odours in the world 
correspond. That they do correspond in this way becomes clear from the fact that when the Lord pleases the spheres of love and faith are readily converted in the world of spirits into spheres of 
sweet and pleasant odours, which are clearly perceived. </p>
<p></p>

 From these considerations it is now clear from where and why 'an odour of rest' means that which is pleasing, why in the Jewish Church an 
odour became a representative, and why 'an odour of rest' is here ascribed to Jehovah or the Lord. 'An odour of rest' is descriptive of peace, that is, of the pleasantness of peace. Peace in one embrace 
takes in every single feature of the Lord's kingdom; for the state of the Lord's kingdom is a state of peace. It is within the state of peace that all the happy states occur which flow from love and 
faith in the Lord. All that has now been stated shows not only what representatives were essentially, but also why the Jewish Church had an altar for burning incense in front of the veil and the Mercy-seat, 
why offerings of frankincense accompanied sacrifices, and also why so many fragrant substances were used in incense, in frankincense, and in the anointing oil too. It shows therefore what 'an 
odour of rest', 'incense', and 'fragrances' mean in the Word, namely celestial things of love, and spiritual things of faith deriving from these, in general everything pleasing that derives from love 
and faith.  </p>

 As in Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
On My holy mountain, on the mountain height of Israel, there all the house of Israel, all of it in the land, will serve Me; there I will accept them, and there I 
will require your contributions, and the first fruits comprising your gifts in all your holy acts. Through the odour of rest I will accept you <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2020:40,%2041&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 20:40, 41</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'an odour of rest' has reference 
to burnt offerings and gifts, that is, to worship stemming from charity and attendant faith, which worship is meant by burnt offerings and gifts, and is consequently acceptable, which is meant by 'the 
odour'. In Amos, </p>
<blockquote>
I hate, I reject your feasts, and I will not smell your solemn assemblies<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> [as a pleasant odour], for though you offer Me your burnt offerings and gifts, they will not be accepted. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%205:21,%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 5:21, 22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This clearly means that which is pleasing or acceptable. The passage which describes Isaac's blessing Jacob instead of Esau reads,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jacob went near and Isaac kissed him. He smelled 
the odour of his clothes, and he blessed him and said, See, the odour of my son, like the odour of a field that Jehovah has blessed. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2027:26,%2027&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 27:26, 27</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The odour of his clothes' means natural good 
and truth whose pleasantness stems from their harmony with celestial and spiritual good and truth. Their pleasantness is described by 'the odour of the field'.

Quod 'odoratus Jehovah odorem quietis' significet quod gratus fuerit Domino cultus inde, nempe cultus ex charitate et fide charitatis, qui per 'holocaustum' significatus, dictum est in versu proxime 
praecedente. Passim in Verbo dicitur quod 'Jehovah odoratus est odorem quietis,' et quidem praecipue ex holocaustis, et ubivis significat gratum seu acceptum; sicut ex holocaustis quod odoratus odorem 
quietis, Exod. xxix 18, 25, 41; Lev. i 9, 13, 17; xxiii 12, 13, 18 Num. xxviii 6, 8, 13; xxix 2, 6, 8, 13, 36; tum ex aliis sacrificiis, Lev. ii 2, 9; vi 8, 14 [A.V. 15, 21]: viii 21, 28; Num. xv 3, 
7, 13; et vocantur 'ignitum in odorem quietis Jehovae,' quo significatur quod ex amore e charitate; 'ignis' in Verbo et 'ignitum,' cum praedicatur de Domino et de cultu Ipsius, significat amorem: similiter 
etiam 'panis,' quare etiam cultus repraesentativus per holocausta et sacrificia appellatur 'panis igniti Jehovae in odorem quietis,' Lev. iii 11, 16.  [2] Quod 'odor' significet gratum et acceptum, 
et sic quod odor quoque in Ecclesia Judaica fuerit repraesentativum grati, et tribuatur Jehovae seu Domino, est causa quod bonum charitatis et verum fidei ex charitate correspondeat odoribus jucundis 
et suavibus; ipsa correspondentia quod sit et qualis sit, constare potest a sphaeris in caelo spirituum et angelorum; sunt ibi sphaerae amoris et fidei, quae manifeste percipiantur; sphaerae tales 
sunt ut cum spiritus bonus aut angelus, seu societas spirituum bonorum aut angelorum adventat, tunc percipitur ilico quoties Domino beneplacet, qualis est spiritus, angelus, seu societas, quoad amorem 
et fidem, et quidem e longinquo, et magis cum praesentior fit; quod incredibile, sed usque est verissimum; talis est communicatio in altera vita, et talis perceptio; quare, cum Domino beneplacet, non 
opus est multis explorare qualis anima seu spiritus est, nam ad primum adventum potest cognosci: his sphaeris correspondent sphaerae odorum in mundo; quod correspondeant, inde constare potest quod 
sphaerae amoris et fidei, quando Domino beneplacet, manifeste in sphaeras odorum jucundorum et suavium vertantur in mundo spirituum, et manifeste percipiantur.  [3] Ex his nunc constat unde et quare 'odor 
quietis' significat gratum, et quare odor repraesentativum factum in Ecclesia Judaica, et 'odor quietis' Jehovae seu Domino tribuatur. 'Odor quietis' est pacis seu gratum pacis; pax in uno complexu 
comprehendit omnia et singula quae sunt regni Domini, nam status regni Domini est status pacis; in statu pacis existunt omnes status felices ex amore et fide in Dominum. Ex his quae nunc dicta sunt, 
patet non solum quomodo repraesentativa se habent; sed etiam quare in Ecclesia Judaica suffimenta, pro quibus altare ante velum et propitiatorium; quare turis oblationes in sacrificiis; tum quare tot 
aromata, in suffimento, in ture, ut et in oleo unctionis adhibebantur; ita quid 'odor quietis,' quid 'suffitus,' et quid 'aromata' significant in Verbo, nempe quod caelestia amoris et inde spiritualia fidei, 
in genere quicquid gratum inde; [4] ut apud Ezechielem,     	In monte sanctitatis Meae, in morte altitudinis Israelis,... ibi servient Mihi omnis domus Israelis, tota in terra, ibi acceptos 
habebo illos; et ibi quaeram sublationes vestras, et primitias munerum vestrorum in omnibus sanctificationibus vestris; per odorem quietis acceptos habebo vos, xx 40, 41;                    ubi 'odor 
quietis' praedicatur de holocaustis et muneribus, hoc est, de cultu ex charitate et ejus fide, qui per holocausta et munera significatur, et inde acceptus est, quod est 'odor': apud Amos, 	Odi, reprobavi 
festa vestra, et non odorabor cessationes vestras, quia si obtuleritis Mihi holocausta et munera vestra, non accepta erunt," v 21, 22;                                      ibi manifeste quod 
significet gratum aut acceptum.  De Isaco benedicente Jacobo pro Esavo, legitur,                               	Cum accederet Jacob, et Isaacus osculatus eum, et odoraretur odorem vestium ejus, et benedixit 
ei, et dixit, Vide, odor filii mei, sicut odor agri, cui benedixit Jehovah, Gen. xxvii 26, 27;         'odor vestium' significat naturale bonum et verum, quod gratum ex concordantia cum caelesti 
et spirituali bono et vero; cujus gratitudo describitur per 'odorem agri.' </p>
