<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9069节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9069.</strong>“牛的主人可算无罪”表这邪恶不可归咎于内在人，因为它来自意愿，而非来自理解力。这从“牛的主人”和“无罪”的含义清楚可知。“牛的主人”是指内在人或属灵人，因为“牛”表示属世人或外在人中对邪恶的情感（<a href="9065.htm">9065</a>节）；因此，“牛的主人”是指内在人，因为此处他是外在人或属世人的“主人”，而内在人有能力给属世人中对邪恶的情感作主人，而且当属世人服从它时，内在人也是主人了，如它在重生之人中间那样。“无罪”是指无可指责。可以说原因在于，邪恶来自意愿，而非来自理解力；因为来自意愿，而非同时来自理解力的邪恶并不谴责一个人。这个人没有看见它，因此不会考虑它是不是邪恶，因而意识不到它。这种邪恶是来自遗传的邪恶，存在于此人被教导它是邪恶之前，以及他被教导之后，但只存在于外在生命，或肉体生命中，而非同时存在于内在人生命，也就是理解力的生命中。因为看见并明白一件事是邪恶，却仍去行它，会使一个人犯罪，如主在约翰福音中所教导的：<br />法利赛人说，难道我们也瞎了眼吗？耶稣对他们说，你们若瞎了眼，就没有罪了；但如今你们说，我们能看见，所以你们的罪还在。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约9.40.htm">9:40</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约9.41.htm">41</a>）<br />没有人因遗传的邪恶受惩罚，只因自己的邪恶受惩罚（参看<a href="966.htm">966</a>，<a href="1667.htm">1667</a>，<a href="2307.htm">2307</a>，<a href="2308.htm">2308</a>，<a href="8806.htm">8806</a>节）。这就是在牛主知道牛习惯用角抵伤人之前，牛用角抵触一个男人或一个女人所表示的邪恶的性质。下一节论述的是一个人所意识到的邪恶，这种邪恶由习惯用角抵伤人的牛来表示，而牛的主人知道它是什么样子，却没有栓好它；随之而来的惩罚就是用石头打死那牛，主人也要死，除非他赔偿。</p>

And the master of the ox shall be guiltless. That this signifies that the evil is not from the internal man, because it is from the will, and not from the intellectual, is evident from the signification 
of "the master of the ox," as being the internal or spiritual man, for by "the ox" is signified the affection of evil in the natural or external man (n. 9065); consequently "the master of the ox" 
denotes the internal man, for here he is "the master" of the external or natural man, because he is able to rule over the affections of evil in the natural, and also does rule when the natural is subordinate, 
as it is with the regenerate; and from the signification of "guiltless," as being without blame. The reason is said to be that the evil came forth from the will and not from the intellectual; 
for evil from the will and not at the same time from the intellectual does not condemn, because the man does not see it, thus does not consider whether it is evil, and therefore he is not conscious of 
it. Such evil is evil from heredity, before the man has been instructed that it is evil, and also after he has been instructed and is merely in external life, or the life of the body; and not at the 
same time in the internal life which is of the understanding. For to see and to understand that a thing is evil, and still to do it, makes a man guilty, as the Lord teaches in John: </p>
<p>     The Pharisees 
said, Are we also blind? Jesus said to them, If ye were blind ye would not have sin; but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remains (John 9:40, 41). [2] (That no one is punished on account of 
hereditary evils, but on account of his own evils, see n. 966, 1667, 2307, 2308, 8806.) Such is the evil which is signified by an ox striking with the horn a man or a woman before the master of the ox 
knew that he was wont to strike with the horn. In the verse which now follows, the evil of which man is conscious is treated of, which evil is signified by an ox wont to strike with the horn, and which 
his master knew and did not guard against. Wherefore the consequent penalty is that the ox shall be stoned, and the man shall die, unless expiation is laid on him. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9069</b></p><p><b>9069.</b>
'And the owner of the ox shall be guiltless' means that the evil is not attributable to the internal man, because it has come from the will but not from the understanding. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'the owner of the ox' as the internal or spiritual man, for 'the ox' means an affection for evil in the natural or external man, <a href="9065.htm">9065</a>, and therefore 'the owner of the ox' is the internal man (here 
the owner or master of the external or natural man is meant, for the internal man has the power to be master over affections for evil in the natural man, and also is the master when the natural has 
been made subject to it, as it is with those who have been regenerated); and from the meaning of 'guiltless' as free from blame. The reason is said to be that the evil has come from the will but not 
from the understanding; for evil coming from the will but not at the same time from the understanding does not damn a person. The person does not see it, or for that reason stop to consider whether it 
is evil, and is not therefore aware of it. Such evil is evil due to heredity, present before the person has been taught that it is evil, and also after he has been taught, but present only in outward 
life or that of the body, and not at the same time in inward life, which is that of the understanding. For seeing and understanding that it is evil and continuing to do it makes a person guilty, as 
the Lord teaches in John, </p>
<p>The Pharisees said, Are we also blind? Jesus said to them. If you were blind you would have no sin; but now you say, 'We see', therefore your sin remains. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%209:40,%2041&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 9:40, 41</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
No one is punished for hereditary evils, only for those properly his own, see <a href="966.htm">966</a>, <a href="1667.htm">1667</a>, <a href="2307.htm">2307</a>, <a href="2308.htm">2308</a>, <a href="8806.htm">8806</a>. Such is the nature of the evil meant by an ox striking a man or a woman with its horn before 
its owner knows that it is accustomed to gore. The next verse refers to evil that a person is aware of. This is meant by an ox accustomed to gore, whose owner knows what it is like but does not 
keep it in, the consequent punishment for which is that the ox shall be stoned and the owner shall die, unless expiation is imposed on him. </p>

`Et dominus bovis insons': quod significet quod non malum ab interno homine, quia ex voluntario et non {1} ex intellectuali, constat ex (x)significatione `domini bovis' quod sit internus seu spiritualis 
homo, per `bovem' enim significatur affectio mali in naturali seu externo homine, n. 9065, inde `dominus bovis' est internus homo, hic enim est dominus externi seu naturalis {2}, nam dominari potest 
super affectiones mali in {3}naturali, et quoque dominatur quando naturale est subordinatum, ut est apud regeneratos; et ex significatione `insontis' quod sit absque culpa; causa dicitur quia malum 
exivit ex voluntario et non ex intellectuali, malum enim ex voluntario et non simul ex intellectuali non damnat, nam homo id non videt, ita non expendit num malum sit, quapropter non est conscius ejus 
{4}; tale malum est malum ex hereditario {5}antequam homo instructus est quod sit malum, et quoque {6}postquam instructus est, et solum in vita externa {7}seu corporis est, et non simul in vita interna 
quae intellectus; nam videre (c)et intelligere quod malum sit, et usque id facere, reum facit hominem, ut Dominus docet apud Johannem, 	Pharisaei dixerunt, Num etiam nos caeci sumus? dixit illis 
Jesus, Si caeci essetis, non haberetis peccatum; jam vero dicitis quod videamus, ideo peccatum vestrum manet, ix 40, 41. 	[2] Quod nemo puniatur propter mala (x)hereditaria sed propter mala propria, 
videatur n. 966, 1667, 2307, 2308, 8806.  Tale malum est quod significatur per bovem cornu ferientem virum aut mulierem antequam dominus bovis sciverit quod cornupeta fuerit; in nunc sequenti versu agitur 
de malo cujus conscius est homo, quod significatur per `bovem cornupetam, de quo scivit dominus (o)ejus et non custodivit'; (d)quare inde poena est, quod bos lapidabitur, et homo morietur {8}, si 
non ponatur {9} expiatio. @1 i simul$ @2 i hominis$ @3 d naturali homine i hoc$ @4 i mali$ @5 d antequam homo instructus est i ante instructionem$ @6 post instructionem, si homo$ @7 est quae
