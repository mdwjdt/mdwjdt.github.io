<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第543节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>543.</strong>有的灵希望了解天堂之乐。他们被允许感受自己至内在的快乐，直到能承受的极限。然而这还不是天使之乐，只是带有一点痕迹而已，如同我被赋予通过他们喜乐的交流所感受到的。它如此细微，几近冰冷，然而他们却称之为无上妙乐，因为对他们来说，这已是最内在的快乐了。由此清楚看出，天堂之乐有层次之分，一个人的顶层可能只是另一人的底层或中层。还清楚看出，当人到达自己的最深层，也就获得了属于自己的天堂之乐，他无法承受更深的快乐，因为那反会成为一种痛苦。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]543.</strong> Once some spirits eager to explore what heavenly joy was like were granted the opportunity to perceive the deepest level of their own joy, up to the point where they could no longer stand it. It was not angelic joy and barely resembled even the least of such joys, as I could tell when their joy was communicated to me. It was so paltry as to seem rather cold. Still, they pronounced it most heavenly, since it was the deepest of their own joys.<br />This experience showed not only that there are different levels but also that the deepest level of one kind barely extends to the shallowest or middle level of another. It demonstrated further that when we gain our most profound joy, we are in our own heavenly joy; we cannot bear any deeper variety, which would only end up turning painful for us. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 543</b></p><p><b>543.</b>
Certain spirits longed to know the nature of heavenly joy, and were therefore allowed to perceive the inmost of their own, to such a degree that they could bear no more; and yet it was not angelic joy, 
being scarcely equal to the least angelic joy, as was given me to perceive by a communication of their joy. It was so slight as to be as it were chilly, and yet being their inmost joy they called it 
most heavenly. From this it was evident not only that there are degrees of joys, but also that the inmost of one scarcely approaches the outmost or middle of another, and that when anyone receives his 
own inmost joy, he is in his heavenly joy, and cannot endure that which is still more interior, for it becomes painful. </p>

Certain spirits wished to know what heavenly joy was. They were allowed therefore to perceive their own inmost joy, even to a point where they could bear it no longer. But even this was not angelic joy. 
It barely resembled the least of angelic joys, and this they were allowed to perceive through the communication of their joy. Their own joy was so meagre that it seemed quite tepid, yet they called 
it most heavenly since it was their own inmost joy. From this it was clear not only that there are degrees of joy but also that the inmost part of one degree comes scarcely anywhere near the outer or 
the middle area of the next. It was also clear that when anybody receives the inmost of his joys this for him is heavenly joy. Nor can he tolerate anything more internal than that, as it becomes painful to him.  </p>

</p><b>543.</b>
Quidam desiderabant nosse quid gaudium caeleste, ideo concessum erat percipere intimum sui usque ad illum gradum ut non plus sustinere possent; sed usque non erat gaudium angelicum, vix erat sicut minimum 
angelicum, quod percipere per communicationem gaudii eorum datum; erat tam leve, ut quasi frigidiusculum, quod tamen vocabant caelestissimum, quia intimum eorum. Inde constabat, non solum quod 
gradus sint, sed etiam quod intimum unius vix accedat ad extimum aut medium alterius; tum quod cum aliquis intimum sui accipit, in gaudio suo caelesti sit, et quod adhuc interius non sustineat, eique 
dolorificum evadat. </p>
