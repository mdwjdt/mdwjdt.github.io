<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3884.</strong>由于世人对天堂或大人与人的一切事物的对应关系，并人通过这种对应关系存在和持续存在的真相一无所知，由于关于这些问题的说明显得似是而非、难以置信，所以我讲述一些我所经历并因此坚信不疑的事。有一次，当内层天堂向我打开，我正与那里的天使交谈时，我得以发现那里的以下活动。要知道，我虽在天堂，但仍未出离肉体，因为天堂在人里面，无论这个人在哪里。所以，主乐意有一个人能在天堂，却未退离肉体。我便以这种方式得以觉察天堂的普遍活动，并且如同以任一感官感知物体那样清楚。在这个特殊场合，我察觉到四种活动在进行。第一种进入大脑的左太阳穴，这是一种涉及理性器官的普遍活动，因为大脑左边对应于理性能力或认知的能力，而右边对应于情感或意愿的能力。<br />我所察觉到的第二种普遍活动进入肺呼吸，它轻柔地控制我自己的呼吸。不过，这种肺呼吸从内进行，因此我无需凭自己的意志来控制我的呼吸或吸气。当时，我清清楚楚地感知到天堂的这种真实呼吸。这是一种内在呼吸，故不为人所察觉，而是通过神奇的对应关系流入世外在或肉体的呼吸。人若丧失这种流注，必立刻倒地身亡。<br />我所察觉到的第三种活动进入心脏的收缩和舒张运动，这种活动当时在我自己里面比任何时候都要轻柔。脉搏很规律（每呼吸一次大约跳动三次），然而，这种跳动却终止于肺部，并使这些运动适合在肺部进行。我得以在某种程度上发现心脏的这种交替运动如何在每次呼吸结束时注入肺部运动。脉动的交替声很容易被发觉，以至于我能将它们数算出来。它们是独立而轻柔的。<br />第四种普遍活动进入肾脏，我也得以察觉这种活动，尽管很模糊。从这些活动明显可知，天堂或大人拥有心跳和呼吸，并且天堂或大人的心跳与心脏及其收缩和舒张运动有一种对应关系；天堂或大人的呼吸运动与肺脏及其呼吸运动有一种对应关系。但这二者都是人所发现不了的，因为它们是内在的，故是无法察觉的。</p>

As in the world it is quite unknown that there is a correspondence of heaven or the Grand Man with all things of man, and that man comes forth and subsists therefrom, so that what is said on the subject 
may seem paradoxical and incredible, I may here relate the things that experience has enabled me to know with certainty. Once, when the interior heaven was opened to me, and I was conversing with 
the angels there, I was permitted to observe the following phenomena. Be it known that although I was in heaven, I was nevertheless not out of myself, but in the body, for heaven is within man, wherever 
he may be, so that when it pleases the Lord, a man may be in heaven and yet not be withdrawn from the body. In this way it was given me to perceive the general workings of heaven as plainly as an object 
is perceived by any of the senses. Four workings or operations were then perceived by me. The first was into the brain at the left temple, and was a general operation as regards the organs of reason; 
for the left side of the brain corresponds to rational or intellectual things, but the right to the affections or things of the will. [2] The second general operation that I perceived was into 
the respiration of the lungs, and it led my respiration gently, but from within, so that I had no need to draw breath or respire by any exertion of my will. The very respiration of heaven was at the time 
plainly perceived by me. It is internal, and for this reason is imperceptible to man; but by a wonderful correspondence it inflows into man's respiration, which is external, or of the body; and if 
man were deprived of this influx, he would instantly fall down dead. [3] The third operation that I perceived was into the systole and diastole of the heart, which had then more of softness with me 
than I had ever experienced at any other time. The intervals of the pulse were regular, being about three within each period of respiration; yet such as to terminate in and thus direct the things belonging 
to the lungs. How at the close of each respiration the alternations of the heart insinuated themselves into those of the lungs, I was in some measure enabled to observe. The alternations of the 
pulse were so observable that I was able to count them; they were distinct and soft.  [4] The fourth general operation was into the kidneys, which also it was given me to perceive, but obscurely. From 
these things it was made manifest that heaven or the Grand Man has cardiac pulses, and that it has respirations; and that the cardiac pulses of heaven or the Grand Man have a correspondence with the 
heart and with its systolic and diastolic motions; and that the respirations of heaven or the Grand Man have a correspondence with the lungs and their respirations; but that they are both unobservable 
to man, being imperceptible, because internal. </p>

As the world knows nothing at all about the correspondence of heaven or the Grand Man with every individual part of man or about the truth that man comes into being and is kept in being from it, and 
as what is going to be said on these matters will seem paradoxical and unbelievable, let me refer to things which I have experienced and of which I am therefore firmly convinced. On one occasion when 
the interior heaven was opened to me and I was talking to the angels there I was allowed to observe the following activities there. (It should be realized that although I was present there in heaven I 
had not left my body at all, for heaven is within a person wherever he is situated. So when it pleases the Lord a person can be in heaven and yet not withdrawn from the body. In this way I was allowed 
to perceive the general activities of heaven as plainly as anything perceived by any of the senses.) On this particular occasion I perceived four activities taking place, the first being into the brain 
at the left temple. This was a general activity involving the organs of reason, for the left side of the brain corresponds to rational powers or those of the understanding, but the right to affections 
or powers of the will. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The second general activity which I perceived was into the breathing of the lungs, which was gently controlling my own breathing. But it did so from what was interior 
and so I had no need to call on my own will to control my breathing or drawing of breath. I perceived plainly at that time the actual breathing of heaven. It is an internal breathing and not therefore 
perceptible to man, but flows in by means of a wonderful correspondence into man's breathing, which is external or of the body. And if man were deprived of that influx he would instantly fall down 
dead. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The third activity which I perceived was into the systole and the diastole of the heart, which was at that time gentler in myself than it had ever been at any other times. The pulse rate 
was regular - round about three beats for every breath that was taken - yet such that beats ended in and so conditioned actions taking place in the lungs. How at the end of each breath taken the alternating 
actions of the heart fitted into those of the lungs I was allowed to observe to a certain extent. The alternate sounds of the pulse could be observed so easily that I was able to count them. They 
were separate and gentle. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The fourth general activity was into the kidneys; this too I was allowed to perceive, though obscurely. From these activities it was evident that heaven or the Grand 
Man has heartbeats and draws breaths, and that the heartbeats of heaven or the Grand Man have a correspondence with the heart and its systolic and diastolic motions, and that the breathing actions of 
heaven or the Grand Man have a correspondence with the lungs and their breathing actions. But neither can be observed by man, being imperceptible because they are internal. </p>

Quia prorsus ignotum est in mundo quod correspondentia si caeli seu Maximi Hominis cum singulis apud hominem, et quod homo inde existat et subsistat, ac ideo apparitura ut paradoxa et incredibilia 
quae de illa dicentur, licet illa quae experientiae et inde apud me confirmatae fidei sunt referre.  Quondam cum aperiretur mihi caelum interius, et ibi cum angelis loquerer, licebat sequentia observare: 
sciendum quod tametsi ibi essem, usque non essem extra me sed in corpore, caelum enim est in homine, in quocumque loco ille sit; ita cum beneplacet Domino, homo potest in caelo esse, et usque 
non abduci a corpore; inde operationes caeli communes dabatur percipere tam manifeste sicut id quod aliquo sensu: quatuor operationes erant quas tunc percepi, primam in cerebrum {1} ad sinistrum 
tempus, quae operatio erat communis quoad organa rationis; sinistra enim pars cerebri correspondet rationalibus seu intellectualibus, dextra autem affectionibus seu voluntariis. [2] Alteram operationem 
communem percepi in respirationem pulmonum, quae respirationem meam molliter ducebat, sed ab interiore, ita ut non opus haberem per aliquod meae voluntatis spiritum ducere seu respirare; ipsa 
respiratio caeli tunc percepta mihi fuit manifeste; est illa interna, ac ideo imperceptibilis homini; sed influit per mirabilem correspondentiam in respirationem hominis, quae externa est seu corporis; 
quo influxu si privaretur homo, momento occumberet mortuus.  [3] Tertia operatio quam percepi, erat in cordis systolen et diastolen, quae tunc mihi mollior erat quam usquam alias; tempora pulsus 
erant regularia, intra respirationis unamquamvis vicem {2} circiter tria, usque tamen talia ut desinerent in pulmonica, et sic pulmonica regerent; quomodo cordis vices se insinuabant in pulmonum 
vices, ad finem cujusvis respirationis quodammodo observare dabatur; vices pulsus tam observabiles erant ut potuissem illas numerare; erant distinctae et molles.  [4] Quarta operatio communis erat 
in renes, quam quoque percipere datum, sed obscure.  Ex his patuit quod caelo seu Maximo Homini sint pulsus cardiaci, et quod sint respirationes; </p>
<p>et quod pulsus cardiaci caeli seu Maximi Hominis 
correspondentiam habeant cum corde, et cum ejus systolicis et diastolicis motibus, et quod respirationes caeli seu Maximi Hominis correspondentiam habeant cum pulmone et ejus respirationibus {3}; 
sed quod utrumque inobservabile sit homini, quia imperceptibile propterea quod interna sint {4}. @1 cerebro$ @2 vices$ @3 animationibus$ @4 nam interna sunt$ </p>
