Verse 8. And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof; and Pharaoh told them his dream; and no one 
interpreted these things to Pharaoh. "And it came to pass in the morning," signifies in this new state; "that his spirit was troubled," signifies disturbance; "and he sent and called all the magicians 
of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof," signifies in consulting the interior as well as the exterior memory-knowledges; "and Pharaoh told them his dream," signifies about things to come; "and no one 
interpreted these things to Pharaoh," signifies that it was not known what would happen. </p>

Verse 8 And it happened early in the morning, that his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called all the magi of Egypt, and all its wise men; and Pharaoh told them his dream, and there was no one to 
interpret them for Pharaoh. </p>
<p>'And it happened early in the morning' means in that new state. 'That his spirit was troubled' means a turmoil. 'And he sent and called all the magi of Egypt, and its 
wise men' means in consulting factual knowledge, interior as well as exterior. 'And Pharaoh told them the dream' means regarding things to come. 'And there was no one to interpret them for Pharaoh' means 
that no knowledge existed of what was going to happen. </p>

interiora tum   exteriora: `et narrabat Pharaoh illis somnium{2} significat de futuris: `et nemo interpretans illa Pharaoni' significat quod nesciretur quid contingeret. @1 A I, here and 5223,
