<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5002节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5002.</strong>“（也不）和她在一处”表唯恐它由此与它成为一体。这从“和某人在一处”的含义清楚可知，“和某人在一处”是指更紧密的结合，或联结起来。“在”（being）表示存在联结，这是因为一个事物的实际存在是良善，一切良善皆从爱流出，爱本质上是属灵的结合或联结。因此，就至高意义而言，主被称为存在或耶和华，因为从爱或属灵的结合流出的一切良善皆源于祂。由于源于祂并通过接受而回到祂那里的爱，以及相爱使天堂构成一体，所以天堂被称为一个婚姻，这婚姻赋予它其“存在”（being）。如果爱与仁是教会的本质存在，教会也会是这样。因此，凡结合或联结不存在的地方，教会就没有存在；因为若非有某种将教会成员联结起来，或使他们合为一体的事物存在，教会就会解体，不再存在。<br />如果人人都只为自己，不为别人，除非为自己的缘故，世间社会的情形也一样。若没有法律将社会成员联结起来，没有对丧失利益、地位、名声或生命的畏惧，社会就彻底分崩离析。这样一个社会的存在也是结合或联结，但仅仅是外在方面的；就内在而言，这种社会没有任何“存在”。因此，在来世，像这样的人都被关在地狱，在那里同样通过外在约束联结在一起，尤其通过恐惧。但是，每当这些约束被松开时，这一个就冲过去毁灭另一个，只渴望将别人彻底毁灭。天堂则不同，在那里，对主之爱和源于这爱的相爱从内在将天堂的成员联结在一起。当外在约束在那里被除去时，他们更紧密地联结在一起；他们因由此更近地被拉向来自主的神性存在，故从内在充满情感，并由此充满自由的感觉，因而充满蒙福、幸福和喜乐的感觉。</p>

To be with her. That this signifies lest in this way it should be united, is evident from the signification of "being with" anyone, as being to be more closely conjoined, or to be united. That "to be" 
means to be united, is because the very being of a thing is good, and all good is of love, which is spiritual conjunction or unition. Hence in the supreme sense the Lord is called being or Jehovah, 
because from Him is all the good which is of love or of spiritual conjunction. As heaven makes a one through love from Him and the reciprocal love to Him through reception, and through mutual love, it 
is therefore called a marriage, through which it is. It would be similar with the church, if love and charity were the being of it. Therefore where there is no conjunction or union, there is no being; 
for unless there is something to bring to a one or to unite, there must be dissolution and extinction. [2] Thus in a civil society, where everyone is for himself and no one for another except for the 
sake of himself, unless there were laws to unite, and fears of the loss of gain, honor, fame, and life, the society would be utterly dissipated; so that the being of such a society is also conjunction 
or unition, but only in externals, while in respect to internals there is no being in it. For this reason also such persons in the other life are kept in hell, and are in like manner held together 
there by external bonds, especially by fears; but whenever these bonds are relaxed, one rushes to compass the destruction of another, and desires nothing more than to put him out of existence. It is 
otherwise in heaven, where there is internal conjunction through love to the Lord and the derivative mutual love. When external bonds are relaxed there, they are more closely conjoined together; and because 
they are thus brought nearer to the Divine being which is from the Lord, they are more interiorly in affection and thence in freedom, consequently in blessedness, happiness, and joy. </p>

'To be with her' means lest it should thereby be made one with it. This is clear from the meaning of 'being with someone' as existing joined more closely or united together. The reason 'being' means 
existing united is that the actual being (esse) of a thing is good, and all good flows from love, love being essentially a spiritual togetherness or oneness. This explains why in the highest sense the 
Lord is called 'Being' (Esse), or Jehovah; for all good flowing from love or spiritual togetherness is derived from Him. Because the love that is derived from Him and returned to Him through the acceptance 
of it, and also mutual love, make heaven one, heaven is therefore called a marriage, which gives it its 'being'. One would be able to say the same of the Church if love and charity existed there 
as its essential being. Therefore where no togetherness or unity exists, the Church has no 'being', for unless something were present there to unite its members or make them one, the Church would disintegrate 
and cease to exist. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The same happens to civil society if everyone there is out only for himself and nobody, except for his own purposes, takes any interest in anyone else. Without laws 
to unite its members, and without any fears for loss of gain, position, reputation, or life, society would fall completely to pieces. Therefore the 'being' of such a society in which everyone is out 
for himself consists in its members being joined or united together, but at a purely external level. Internally that society does not have any 'being'. Consequently in the next life people like this 
are confined to hell, where in a similar way they are kept in check by external restraints, especially by fears. But as often as those restraints are eased, one individual hastens to destroy another, 
there being nothing he wants to do more than to destroy another completely. It is different in heaven, where love to the Lord and mutual love deriving from that love join its members together at an internal 
level. When external restraints are removed there, angels become even more closely joined to one another. And being thereby drawn nearer to the Divine Being (Esse) coming to them from the Lord, 
they are filled deeper still with affection, and from this with a sense of freedom, and as a consequence with feelings of blessedness, happiness, and joy. </p>

</p><b>5002.</b>
`Ad esse cum illa': quod significet ne sic adunaretur, constat ex significatione `esse cum aliqua' quod sit (o)arctius conjungi seu uniri; quod `esse' sit uniri, est quia ipsum esse rei est bonum, 
et omne bonum est amoris, qui est conjunctio spiritualis seu unitio; inde in supremo sensu vocatur Dominus `Esse' seu Jehovah, qui ab Ipso omne bonum quod est amoris seu conjunctionis spiritualis. 
 Caelum quia unum facit per amorem ab Ipso, et reciprocum in Ipsum per receptionem, et per amorem mutuum, ideo vocatur conjugium, per quod `est'; similiter foret cum Ecclesia si apud illam amor et 
charitas foret ejus `esse'; ubi itaque non est conjunctio seu unio, ibi non est `esse', nam nisi aliquid foret quod redigeret ad unum seu uniret, dissolveretur et exstingueretur: </p>
<p>[2] ita {1} in societate 
civili ubi unusquisque pro se est et nullus pro alio nisi propter se, (o)nisi essent leges quae unirent, et essent timores jacturae lucri, honoris, famae, vitae, societas prorsus dissiparetur; 
quapropter `esse' talis societatis conjunctio seu adunatio, sed solum in externis, at respective ad interna apud illam non est `esse'; quapropter etiam tales in altera vita in inferno tenentur, 
et similiter ibi per externa continentur vincti, temporis per timores, verum {2} quoties relaxantur illa vincula, ruit unus in alterius perniciem, et nihil potius cupit quam alterum prorsus exstinguere; 
aliter in caelo ubi conjunctio interna est per amorem in Dominum et inde amorem mutuum; cum ibi relaxantur vincula externa, arctius mutuo conjunguntur; et quia sic propius ad Esse Divinum quod 
a Domino, rediguntur, interius in affectione sunt et inde in libero, consequenter in beato, felici et gaudio. @1 i nisi here instead of before essent$ @2 et$ </p>
