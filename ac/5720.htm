<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5720节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5720.</strong>有些时候伪君子与我在一起，也就是那些以神圣的口吻谈论神性事物，还带着对公众和邻舍的情感和爱，声称自己信仰公义、公平的灵人。然而，他们心里却厌弃并嗤笑这些事。当他们被允许流入他们通过反面所对应的身体部位时，便给我的牙齿带来疼痛；当离得非常近时，他们带来的疼痛如此剧烈，以致我无法忍受。不过，随着他们被移走，疼痛就消失了。这一情形反复向我演示，好叫我毫不怀疑。他们中间有一个人活在肉身时我就认识他，于是我和他说话。由于他的同在，我又感觉牙齿和牙龈的疼痛。当他被提向左侧时，疼痛转到我的下颌骨，侵袭左太阳穴的骨头，并由此进入我的颧骨。</p>

Hypocrites have been with me, those namely who have spoken in a holy manner about Divine things, and with an affection of love about the public and the neighbor, and have borne witness to what is just 
and equitable, and yet in their heart have despised and even laughed at these things. When they were permitted to flow into the parts of the body to which they correspond by opposition, they inflicted 
pain on the teeth, so severe on their nearest presence that I could not bear it; and in proportion as they were removed, the pain ceased. This was shown repeatedly, that no doubt might remain. Among 
them was one whom I had known in the life of his body, and I therefore spoke to him; and at his presence also there was pain in the teeth and gums. When he was raised upward to the left, the pain attacked 
the left jaw, and invaded the bone of the left temple down to the bones of the cheek. </p>

There have been times when hypocrites were present with me. That is to say, spirits have been present who spoke with reverence about Divine matters, and with affection and love about society and their 
neighbour, declaring a belief in what was right and fair. Yet in their heart they rejected all this and scorned it. When they were allowed to flow into those parts of my body to which they corresponded 
in a contrary sense, they introduced pain into my teeth; and when they were very close they introduced pain so severe that I could not bear it. But in the measure that they were moved away the pain 
left off. This has been demonstrated to me repeatedly, to remove all shadow of doubt. Those spirits included someone whom I had known during his lifetime, and therefore I spoke to him. Again, as was 
his presence, so was the pain I felt in my teeth and gums. When he was being raised up towards the left the pain moved into my left jawbone and the bone forming my left temple, and from these into my 
cheekbones. </p>

</p><b>5720.</b>
Hypocritae cum apud me fuerunt, nempe qui sancte locuti de Divinis, cum affectione amoris de publico et proximo, et testati justum et aequum, et usque corde suo spreverunt illa, et quoque irriserunt; 
cum licebat eis influere in partes corporis quibus ex opposito correspondebant, injecerunt dolorem dentibus, et ad praesentiam proximam tam gravem ut non sustinere potuissem; et quantum removebantur 
tantum cessabat dolor; quod ostensum repetitis vicibus ne aliquid dubii superesset.  Inter illos fuit quidam in vita corporis sui mihi notus, quapropter cum illo locutus; et quoque sicut ejus praesentia 
erat, ita dolor dentibus et gingivis; is cum {1}sursum levabatur ad sinistrum, dolor sinistram maxillam et sinistri temporis os, usque ad ossa genae invasit. @1 superius$ </p>
