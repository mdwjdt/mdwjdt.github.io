THE INTERNAL SENSE.      Verses 1-3. And Jacob dwelt in the land of his father's sojournings, in the land of Canaan. These are the births of Jacob. Joseph, a son of seventeen years, was feeding the 
flock with his brethren; and he was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and with the sons of Zilpah his father's women; and Joseph brought their evil report unto their father. And Israel loved Joseph more than 
all his sons, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a tunic of various colors. "And Jacob dwelt in the land of his father's sojournings, in the land of Canaan," signifies that the 
Lord's Divine natural was accordant under Divine rational good; "these are the births of Jacob," signifies the things which follow; "Joseph," signifies the Lord's spiritual Divine Human; "a son of seventeen 
years," signifies its state; "was feeding the flock with his brethren," signifies that it was present with those who were in faith and taught; "and he was a boy," signifies at first; "with the 
sons of Bilhah and with the sons of Zilpah his father's women," signifies that it was rejected by them; "and Joseph brought their evil report unto their father," signifies that from it their quality 
was apparent; "and Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons," signifies the conjunction of the Divine spiritual of the rational with the Divine spiritual of the natural; "because he was the son of his 
old age," signifies its own life in it; "and he made him a tunic of various colors," signifies the appearances of truth thence, whereby the spiritual of the natural is known and distinguished. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE </p>
<p>Verses 1-3 And Jacob dwelt in the land of his father's sojournings, in the land of Canaan. These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, a son of seventeen years, was pasturing the 
flock with his brothers; and he, still a boy, was with the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father's womenfolk; and Joseph brought a bad report of them to their father. And Israel loved Joseph 
more than all his sons, for he was the son of his old age; and he made him a tunic of various colours. </p>
<p>'Jacob dwelt in the land of his father's sojournings, in the land of Canaan' means the Lord's 
Divine Natural, which existed in accord with and beneath Divine Rational Good. 'These are the generations of Jacob' means the things that follow. 'Joseph' means the Lord's Spiritual [from His] Divine 
Human. 'A son of seventeen years' means His state. 'Was pasturing the flock with his brothers' means its presence among those governed by faith who were teachers. 'And he, still a boy' means at first. 
'Was with the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father's womenfolk' means that he was cast away from them. 'And Joseph brought a bad report of them to their father' means that this showed 
up the essential nature of those people. 'And Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons' means a joining of the Divine Spiritual of the Rational to the Divine Spiritual of the Natural. 'For he was 
the son of his old age' means its own life within it. 'And he made him a tunic of various colours' means the resulting appearances of truth by which the spiritual of the natural is recognized and distinguished. </p>

SENSUS INTERNUS Vers. 1-3.  Et habitavit Jacob in terra peregrinationum patris sui in terra Canaan.  Hae nativitates Jacobi: Joseph filius septendecim annorum, fuit pascens cum fratribus suis 
gregem, et is puer, cum filiis Bilhae et cum filiis Zilpae, feminarum patris sui; </p>
<p>et adduxit Joseph malam famam illorum ad patrem illorum.  Et Israel amavit Josephum prae omnibus filiis suis, quia 
filius senectutum is ei, et fecit ei tunicam variorum colorum.  `Habitavit Jacob in terra peregrinationum patris sui in terra Canaan' significat Divinum Naturale Domini quod concordans sub Divino Bono 
Rationali: </p>
<p>`hae nativitates Jacobi' significat illa quae sequuntur: `Joseph' significat Divinum Humanum Spirituale Domini: `filius septendecim annorum' significat statum Ipsius: `fuit pascens cum 
fratribus suis gregem' significat quod interesset illis qui in fide essent qui docebant: `et is puer' significat primum: `cum filiis Bilhae et cum filiis Zilpae, feminarum patris sui' significat 
quod rejectis ab illis: `et adduxit Joseph malam famam illorum ad patrem illorum' significat quod ab ipso appareret quales essent: `et Israel amavit Josephum prae omnibus filiis suis' significat conjunctionem 
Divini Spiritualis Rationalis cum Divino Spirituali Naturalis: `quia filius senectutum is ei' significat vitam suam in illo: `et fecit ei tunicam variorum colorum' significat apparentias 
veri inde, ex quibus spirituale naturalis cognoscitur et distinguitur.      @1 i sunt$      @2 i et$ </p>
