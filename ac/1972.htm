<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1972节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1972.</strong>就显现在灵眼而非肉眼面前的异象，确切地说景象而言，它们越来越内在。我在清晰的光中看到过我在灵人界所见到的那些事物，但天使灵天堂中的事物，我看得相对模糊，天使天堂的事物则看得更模糊。因为我灵的视觉极少被打开到那种程度，不过，我凭某种直觉（这种直觉的性质难以描述）得知他们在说什么，并且常常借助中间灵人。那里的事物有时显现在天堂之光的阴影中，这阴影完全不同于世间之光的阴影。这是一种越来越微弱的光，因为它不被理解力和视觉所理解。</p>

As regards the visions, or rather sights, that appear before the eyes of the spirit, not before the eyes of the body, they are more and more interior. Those which I have seen in the world of spirits 
I have seen in clear light, but those in the heaven of angelic spirits I have seen more obscurely, and still more obscurely those in the heaven of angels, for the sight of my spirit has rarely been opened 
to me so far, but it has been given me to know what they were saying, by a certain perception, the nature of which cannot be described, and frequently through intermediate spirits; the things which 
are there have sometimes appeared in the shade of the light of heaven, which is not like the shade of the light of the world, for it is light growing thin and faint from its incomprehensibility equally 
as discerned by the understanding and by the sight. </p>

As for the visions, or rather sights, which appear before the eyes of the spirit but not before those of the body, they are more and more interior. Those which I have seen in the world of spirits I have 
seen in bright light; but those which I have seen in the heaven of angelic spirits I have seen less clearly, and those in the heaven of angels less clearly still; for rarely has the sight of my spirit 
been opened that far. Nevertheless by a certain perception, the nature of which defies description, I have been given to know what they were saying, quite often by means of intermediary spirits. 
Sometimes the things that are there have appeared in the shade of the light of heaven, a shade not at all like the shade belonging to the light of the world, for it is a light that grows feebler and fainter 
from its not being comprehended by the understanding and the sight alike. </p>

Quod visiones, seu potius visa, attinet quae coram oculis spiritus non coram oculis corporis apparent, sunt interiora magis et magis; quae vidi in mundo spirituum, in clara luce vidi; at obscurius illa 
quae in caelo spirituum angelicorum; et adhuc obscurius (o)illa quae in caelo angelorum; nam usque eo raro apertus mihi fuit visus spiritus mei, sed perceptione quadam, quae qualis sit, non describi 
potest, datum est nosse quid loquerentur, saepius per intermedios spiritus; apparuerunt quandoque illa quae ibi, in umbra lucis caeli, quae umbra non similis est umbrae lucis mundanae, est enim lux 
tenuescens et fatiscens incomprehensibilitate aeque coram intellectu ac coram visu. </p>
