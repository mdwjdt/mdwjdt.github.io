<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1767节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">第15章  圣经或圣言，以及其中如何隐藏神性事物，这些事物在善灵和天使面前完全可见</h4><br />1767.人若热爱圣言并过着仁爱的生活，或出于简单的心思相信经上所写内容，没有形成违背处于内义的信之真理的观念，那么在阅读主的圣言时，主也会将它展现在天使面前。主以极其优美、愉悦的形式这样做，也使用代表物。这一过程伴随着无法描述的变化，各自都与天使当时的整个状态一致，以致每个细节都被感觉具有生命。当圣言从天而降时，这生命就是存在于圣言中的事物，圣言由此孕育而生。由于这个原因，尽管主的圣言在字义上显得粗糙、不完美，但它具有这样的性质：它里面隐藏着属灵和属天之物；当人阅读圣言时，这些事物在善灵和天使面前完全可见。</p>

Others believe what it says in a simple-hearted way, without making assumptions that undermine the religious truth of its inner meaning. When the Word is read by either kind of person, it is displayed by the Lord before angels' eyes with tremendous beauty and charm, accompanied by visual representations and adapted with inexpressible variety to every phase they are then passing through. The beauty and charm are so great that every single facet is perceived as alive. This vital energy is the life that lies within the Word and that gave birth to the Word when it was sent down from heaven. For this reason, the Lord's Word by its very nature conceals spiritual and heavenly messages within, no matter how unpolished it seems in the letter. These inner messages lie open to the view of good spirits and of angels when people on earth read the Word.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} There are no sections numbered 1765, 1766 in the first edition.

CHAPTER 15       CONCERNING THE HOLY SCRIPTURE OR WORD, IN WHICH ARE STORED UP DIVINE THINGS, WHICH ARE OPEN BEFORE GOOD SPIRITS AND ANGELS When the Word of the Lord is being read by a man who loves 
the Word and lives in charity, or by a man who from simplicity of heart believes what is written and has not formed principles contrary to the truth of faith which is in the internal sense, it is presented 
by the Lord before the angels in such beauty and in such pleasantness, with representatives also, and this with inexpressible variety in accordance with all their state at the time, that every 
particular is perceived as if it had life, which life is that which is in the Word, and from which the Word had birth when it was sent down from heaven. From this cause the Word of the Lord is such, 
that although in the letter it appears crude, there are stored up in it spiritual and celestial things which lie open before good spirits, and before angels, when the Word is being read by man. </p>

<p>SACRED SCRIPTURE, OR THE WORD, AND HOW IT CONCEALS WITHIN ITSELF DIVINE MATTERS WHICH ARE FULLY VISIBLE TO GOOD SPIRITS AND TO ANGELS </p>
<p>When the Word of the Lord is being read by someone who 
loves the Word and leads a charitable life - even by one who, because he is simple-hearted, believes what is written and has not formed opinions that are contrary to the truth of faith that lies within 
the internal sense - the Lord also sets the Word before the angels. The Lord does so in such beauty and such loveliness, using representatives as well, with indescribable variations, each of which accords 
with the angels' entire state at the time, that every detail is perceived as if it had life. This life is that which is present within the Word and from which the Word was given birth when it was 
sent down from heaven. By reason of this, although in the letter it appears rough and imperfect, the Word of the Lord is such that inwardly there are concealed spiritual and celestial things, which 
are fully visible to good spirits and to angels while it is being read by man.

{1}			              GENESEOS        			  CAPUT DECIMUM QUINTUM De Scriptura Sacra seu Verbo, quod Divina recondat, quae patent 			coram spiritibus bonis et angelis </p>
<p>Verbum Domini cum legitur ab homine 
qui amat Verbum et in charitate vivit, etiam ab homine qui ex simplici corde credit quod scriptum nec principia formavit contra verum fidei quod in sensu interno, sistitur illud a Domino coram angelis 
in tali pulchritudine, et in tali amoenitate etiam cum repraesentativis, et hoc inexpressibili varietate secundum omnem statum illorum in quo tunc sunt, ut percipiantur singula quasi vitam habere 
quae vita est quae in Verbo, et ex qua natum est Verbum cum demissum caelo; ob hanc causam Verbum Domini tale est quod tametsi rude apparet in littera, usque intus recondat spiritualia et caelestia, 
quae patent coram spiritibus bonis et coram angelis, cum ab homine legitur. 	@1 So 1, nos. 1765 and 1766 are missing.$ </p>
