<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9921节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9921.</strong>“要有金铃铛”表过到那些属于教会的人那里去的源于良善的教义和敬拜的一切方面或事物。这从“铃铛”的含义清楚可知，“铃铛”是指过到那些属于教会的人那里去的教义和敬拜的一切方面或事物，如下文所述。铃铛是金作的表示它们源于良善，因为“金”表示良善（参看<a href="113.htm">113</a>，<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="1552.htm">1552</a>，<a href="5658.htm">5658</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>，<a href="6917.htm">6917</a>，<a href="8932.htm">8932</a>，<a href="9490.htm">9490</a>，<a href="9510.htm">9510</a>，<a href="9874.htm">9874</a>，<a href="9881.htm">9881</a>，<a href="9884.htm">9884</a>节）。“铃铛”之所以表示过到那些属于教会的人那里去的教义和敬拜的一切方面或事物，是因为百姓通过这些铃铛听见并意识到亚伦正在进行供职，因为“百姓”表示那些属于教会的人，“亚伦供职”表示教义和敬拜的一切方面或事物。因此，在下文，经上说：<br />亚伦供职的时候，这袍子要在他身上。他进圣所到耶和华面前，以及出来的时候，他的响声必被听见。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.35.htm">28:35</a>）<br />由此明显可知“铃铛”表示什么。铃铛之所以安在底边上，是因为教义的神圣事物居于最外层，对它们的倾听和理解就发生在最低层，并来自最低层（参看<a href="9824.htm">9824</a>，<a href="9905.htm">9905</a>节）。</p>

And bells of gold. That this signifies all things of doctrine and of worship from good passing over to those who are of the church, is evident from the signification of "bells," as being all things of 
doctrine and of worship passing over to those who are of the church (of which below); that they are from good is signified by their being of gold, for "gold" signifies good (see n. 113, 1551, 1552, 
5658, 6914, 6917, 8932, 9490, 9510, 9874, 9881, 9884). That "the bells" denote all things of doctrine and of worship passing over to those who are of the church, is because by means of the bells the people 
heard and perceived the presence of Aaron in his ministration, for by "the people" are signified those who are of the church, and by "Aaron's ministry" are signified all things of doctrine and of 
worship; and therefore it is said in what follows: </p>
<p>     And they shall be upon Aaron to minister; and the voice thereof shall be heard when he goeth in unto the holiness before Jehovah, and when be 
cometh out (Exod. 28:35); </p>
<p>from which it is plain what is signified by "the bells." The reason why these bells were put in the skirts, was that the holy things of doctrine are in the extremes, and the 
hearing and perception are there, and are from thence (see n. 9824, 9905). </p>

'And bells of gold' means all aspects of religious teachings and of worship springing from good which come across to those who belong to the Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'bells' as all aspects 
of religious teachings and worship which come across to those who belong to the Church, dealt with below. Springing from good is meant by the bells' being made from gold; for 'gold' means good, <a href="113.htm">113</a>, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="1552.htm">1552</a>, <a href="5658.htm">5658</a>, <a href="6914.htm">6914</a>, <a href="6917.htm">6917</a>, <a href="8932.htm">8932</a>, <a href="9490.htm">9490</a>, <a href="9510.htm">9510</a>, <a href="9874.htm">9874</a>, <a href="9881.htm">9881</a>, <a href="9884.htm">9884</a>. The reason why all aspects of religious teachings and of worship which come across to those who belong to the Church are meant by 
'bells' is that by means of those bells the people heard and recognized the presence of Aaron engaged in his ministry; for those who belong to the Church are meant by 'the people', and all aspects of 
religious teachings and of worship by 'Aaron's ministry'. Therefore it says in what follows, And they shall be on Aaron when he ministers, and his voice will be heard when he goes into the holy place 
before Jehovah, and when he comes out. From all this it is evident what is meant by 'bells'. The reason why those bells were placed on the hem was that the holiness which religious teachings possess 
resides on the most external levels, and on these levels and from these levels the hearing and understanding of them takes place, see <a href="9824.htm">9824</a>, <a href="9905.htm">9905</a>.  </p>

`Et tintinnabula auri': quod significet omnia doctrinae et cultus ex bono transeuntia ad illos qui ab Ecclesia, constat ex significatione `tintinnabulorum' quod sint omnia doctrinae et cultus transeuntia 
ad illos qui ab Ecclesia, de qua sequitur; quod ex bono, significatur per quod essent ex auro, nam `aurum' significat bonum, n. 113, 1551, 1552, 5658, 6914, 6917, 8932, 9490, 9510, 9874, 9881, (x)9884. 
Quod `tintinnabula' sint omnia doctrinae et cultus transeuntia ad illos qui ab Ecclesia, est quia per illa a populo audiebatur et percipiebatur praesentia Aharonis in ministrando, {1}per `populum' 
enim significantur illi qui ab Ecclesia, et per `ministerium Aharonis' {2}significantur omnia doctrinae et cultus; quapropter in sequentibus dicitur, Et erunt super Aharone ad ministrandum, et audietur 
vox ejus in intrando illo ad sanctum coram Jehovah, et in exeundo illo, ex quibus patet quid per `tintinnabula' significatur. Quod tintinnabula illa in fimbriis posita fuerint, erat causa quia 
sancta doctrinae {3}sunt in extremis, et (d)quoque ibi ac inde auditio et perceptio, videatur n. 9824, 9905. @1 et per populum$ @2 significabantur$ @3 et cultus est$ </p>
