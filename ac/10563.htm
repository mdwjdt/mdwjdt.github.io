<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10563节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10563</strong>.“你也在我眼中蒙恩”表他被接纳，因为他有能力领导这个民族。这从“在耶和华眼中蒙恩”的含义清楚可知，“在耶和华眼中蒙恩”是指被接纳，在此是指由于他的品性而被接纳，这由“我按名认识你”来表示。他的品性是这样：他有能力领导这个民族；因为主预见摩西能领导以色列人民。主预见到这一点，这从以下事实明显看出来：摩西在行使王权所在的法老王的宫廷长大，他由此获得了凌驾于他人之上的权威。也正因如此，他被接纳来领导这个民族。此外，他的品性还是这样：他能比这个民族的其他人更好地接受神性将要说的话，因为他不像这个民族那样如此处于与内在之物分离的外在之物。因此，这些就是“我按名认识你，你也在我眼中蒙恩”所表示的事。</p>

And thou hast also found grace in Mine eyes. That this signifies that he was received because he could preside over that nation, is evident from the signification of "finding grace in the eyes of Jehovah," 
as being to be received, here on account of his quality, which is signified by "I know thee by name." His quality was that he could preside over that nation, for Moses was foreseen by the Lord 
to preside over the Israelitish people. That this was foreseen is evident from the fact that he was brought up in the palace of King Pharaoh, where there were lordships, and from this he acquired the 
disposition of being preeminent to others; on which account he was received to preside over his people.  His quality likewise was such that he could receive speech from the Divine better than others 
of that nation, for he was not so much in what is external separate from what is internal as they were. These therefore are the things which are signified by, "I know thee by name, and thou hast also 
found grace in Mine eyes." </p>

'And also you have found grace in My eyes' means that he was accepted because he had the ability to head that nation. This is clear from the meaning of 'finding grace in Jehovah's eyes' as being accepted, 
at this point on account of his character, meant by 'I know you by name'. That character was such that he had the ability to head that nation; for the Lord foresaw that Moses would head the Israelite 
people. His foresight of this is evident from the fact that Moses was brought up in the court of Pharaoh the king where rule was exercised, and where he gained an air of authority over others. It 
was for this reason also that he was accepted to head that nation. In addition to this his character was such that he was better able than others from that nation to receive what would be uttered by 
the Divine, for the external in his case was not so separate from the internal as it was with that nation. These therefore are the considerations that are meant by 'I know you by name, and also you have 
found grace in My eyes'.  </p>

`Et quoque invenisti gratiam in oculis Meis':  quod significet quod {1}receptus quia genti isti praeesse potuit, constat ex significatione `invenire gratiam in oculis Jehovae' quod sit {2}receptus esse, 
hic propter quale, quod significatur per `novi te nomine'; quale erat quod genti isti {3}praeesse potuerit; Moscheh enim praevisus est a Domino ut populo Israelitico praeesset; quod hoc praevisum 
sit, patet ex eo quod educatus sit in aula regis Pharaonis, ubi dominia erant, inde {4}etiam animum {5}praeeminentiae super alios traxit; ideo quoque receptus est ut praeesset populo suo; quale (t)ejus 
etiam erat ut recipere posset loquelam a Divino melius quam alii ex illa gente, nam non ita in externo separato ab interno fuit sicut illa gens. Haec itaque sunt quae significantur per `novi te nomine, 
et quoque invenisti gratiam in oculis Meis.' @1 acceptus altered to receptus$ @2 acceptus$ @3 Before genti$ @4 quoque$ @5 praeeminendi A, praeeminentia IT$ </p>
