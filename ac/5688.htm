<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5688节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5688.</strong>“你们向我所说那最小的兄弟就是这位吗”表在他们所有人之后出生的，这也是他们所十分清楚的。这从“最小的兄弟”和“你们向我所说的”的含义清楚可知：“最小的兄弟”是指在他们所有人之后出生的那位，如下文所述；“你们向我所说的”是指他们所察觉到的。因为“说”表示所察觉到的事，因而表示已十分清楚的事，如刚才所述（<a href="5687.htm">5687</a>节）。便雅悯在此之所以被称为他们的“最小的兄弟”（事实上，他的确是），也就是在他们所有人之后出生的那位，或论出生最小的那位，是因为就灵义而言，“便雅悯”所代表的居间层同样是最后到来的。居间层在人里面是最后生的，因为当人在经历属灵的出生，也就是正在重生时，他的理性层，即内在人，首先被主重生，然后他的属世层重生，理性层是主用来使属世层重生的手段（参看<a href="3286.htm">3286</a>，<a href="3288.htm">3288</a>，<a href="3321.htm">3321</a>，<a href="3493.htm">3493</a>，<a href="4612.htm">4612</a>节）。由于居间层源于这二者，也就是说，既源于已经变得属灵或变新的理性层，也源于属世层，还由于居间层无法源于属世层，除非这属世层也变新，所以居间层只能在以后的阶段出生，并且仅在属世层重生的程度内出生。<br />在圣言中，关于雅各的儿子们所记载的一切事都是按着神的旨意发生的，以便能写下关于他们及其后代的圣言。这圣言要包含天上的事物在里面，并在至高意义上包含神性事物，这些儿子在实际生活中就代表这些事物。便雅悯也是这种情况，他是最后出生的，故代表内在与外在之间，也就是主在世时所拥有的属灵层的属天层，与也是主所拥有，并要使之变成神性的属世层之间的居间层。<br />关于约瑟和他兄弟所记载的一切在至高意义上代表主之人身的荣耀，也就是主如何在自己里面将这人身变成神性。这一切就是至内在意义上所代表的，因为就其至内在的意义而言，圣言是最为神圣的，还因为圣言的每一个细节都包含能进入天使智慧的东西在里面；因为众所周知，天使的智慧远远超越人的智慧，以致人几乎无法理解其丝毫。天使的幸福本身就在于圣言的一切细节皆与主有关，或说指向主；因为他们住在主里面。此外，主之人身的荣耀就是人重生的模式；这就是为何人的重生与主的荣耀同时呈现在圣言的内义中。人的重生及其相关的无数奥秘还进入天使的智慧，并照着天使将这些奥秘投入其功用，也就是关注人的改造而给他们带来幸福。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5688</b></p><p><b>5688.</b>
Is this your youngest brother, of whom ye spoke unto me? That this signifies the one born after all, as was also known to them, is evident from the signification of the "youngest brother," as being the 
one born after all (of which in what follows); and from the signification of the words "of whom ye spoke unto me," as being what was perceived by them. (That "to speak" denotes what is perceived, thus 
what is known, may be seen just above, n. 5687.) That Benjamin is here called, as he was, their "youngest brother," that is, the one born after all or the youngest in birth, is because it is similar 
in the spiritual sense with the intermediate which Benjamin represents; for the intermediate is born in man last of all, because when a man is born spiritually, that is, when he is reborn, his rational, 
which is the internal human, is first regenerated by the Lord, and afterward his natural (see n. 3286, 3288, 3321, 3493, 4612); and as the intermediate partakes of both (of the rational made spiritual, 
or made new, and also of the natural), and as it cannot take anything from the natural unless this also is made new, therefore the intermediate cannot be born till afterward, and indeed according 
to the degree in which the natural is being regenerated. [2] All things that are related in the Word of Jacob's sons had so come to pass of Providence, in order that the Word might be written about 
them and their descendants, and might contain within it heavenly things, and in the supreme sense Divine things, which they would represent in actual life. So also was it with Benjamin, who being born 
last, would therefore represent the intermediate between the internal and the external, or between the celestial of the spiritual which the Lord had in the world, and the natural which the Lord also 
had and was to make Divine.  [3] All that is related of Joseph and his brethren represents in the supreme sense the glorifying of the Lord's Human, that is, how the Lord made the Human in Him Divine. 
The reason for this being represented in the inmost sense is that the Word might be most holy in its inmost sense, and also that it might contain in every part of it what would enter into the wisdom 
of the angels; for it is known that angelic wisdom so far surpasses human intelligence that scarcely anything of it can be apprehended by man. It is also the happiness itself of the angels that every 
detail of the Word has reference to the Lord; for they are in the Lord. Furthermore, the glorifying of the Lord's Human is the pattern of man's regeneration, and hence man's regeneration also is presented 
in the internal sense of the Word at the same time with the glorification of the Lord. Man's regeneration together with its innumerable mysteries also enters into the angels' wisdom, and affords 
them happiness according as they apply it to its uses, which are for man's reformation. </p>

'Is this your youngest brother, whom you said [something about] to me?' means born after all of them, as they well knew. This is clear from the meaning of 'youngest brother' as the one born after all 
of them, dealt with in what follows; and from the meaning of 'whom you said to me' as that which was perceived by them. For 'saying' means that which has been perceived, see immediately above in <a href="5687.htm">5687</a>, 
and so means what is well known. The reason Benjamin is called here, as he in fact was, their 'youngest brother' - that is, the one born after all of them, or the youngest by birth - is that in the 
spiritual sense the intermediary, which 'Benjamin' represents, is likewise the one that comes last. The intermediary in a person is born last of all; for when a person is undergoing spiritual birth - 
that is, when he is being born again - his rational, which is his inner man, is regenerated first by the Lord, then the natural after that, the rational being the means by which the Lord regenerates the 
natural, <a href="3286.htm">3286</a>, <a href="3288.htm">3288</a>, <a href="3321.htm">3321</a>, <a href="3493.htm">3493</a>, <a href="4612.htm">4612</a>. Now since the intermediary must be derived from both these - both from the spiritual rational or rational that has been made new, and from the natural - and since 
the intermediary cannot be derived from the natural unless this too has been made new, the intermediary is inevitably born at a later stage, and then only insofar as the natural is regenerated. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
Everything recorded in the Word regarding the sons of Jacob happened for a providential reason, which was that the Word might be written dealing with them and their descendants. This Word was to 
contain heavenly realities, and in the highest sense Divine ones, which those sons in actual fact represented. This was no less so in the case of Benjamin who, being the one born last of all, represented 
the intermediary between the internal and the external, that is, between the celestial of the spiritual which was the Lord's when He was in the world and the natural which was also the Lord's and 
which He was to make Divine. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Everything recorded about Joseph and his brothers represents in the highest sense the glorification of the Lord's Human, that is, the way in which the Lord made the 
Human within Himself Divine. The reason this is what is represented in the inmost sense is so that in its inmost sense the Word may be completely holy. A further reason is that every detail recorded 
may contain within itself what can pass into angelic wisdom; for it is well known that angelic wisdom so surpasses man's wisdom that man can hardly begin to comprehend any of it. The actual happiness 
of the angels resides in the fact that every detail has to do with the Lord; for they abide in Him. Furthermore the glorification of the Lord's Human is the pattern for a person's regeneration, which 
is why a person's regeneration is also presented in the internal sense at the same time as the subject of the Lord's glorification is dealt with. A person's regeneration and the countless arcana associated 
with it also passes into angelic wisdom and brings the angels happiness insofar as they apply those arcana to useful services, which look to a person's reformation. </p>

`An hic frater vester minimus, quem dixistis ad me?':  quod significet natum post omnes, ut quoque illis notum, constat ex significatione `fratris minimi' quod sit qui natus post omnes, de qua sequitur; 
et ex significatione `quem dixistis ad me' quod sit perceptum ab illis; quod `dicere' sit perceptum, videatur mox supra n. 5687, ita notum.  Quod Benjamin dicatur hic, sicut fuerat, `frater eorum 
minimus', hoc est, natus post omnes seu natu minimus, est quia ita quoque cum medio quod repraesentat `Benjamin', se habet in sensu spirituali; medium enim apud hominem nascitur post omnes, cum enim 
nascitur homo spiritualiter, hoc est, cum renascitur, tunc rationale ejus quod est internum humanum, primum a Domino regeneratur, et postmodum naturale, quia per rationale regeneratur a Domino naturale 
n. 3286, 3288, 3321, 3493, 4612; medium itaque quia trahet ab utroque, nempe a rationali spirituali seu novo facto, et quoque a naturali, et quia medium non aliquid trahere potest a naturali nisi hoc 
quoque novum fiat, idcirco non potest medium nasci quam postea, et quidem secundum gradum quo naturale regeneratur.  [2]Omnia quae de filiis Jacobi memorantur in Verbo, ita ex providentia contigerant, 
ob causam {1}quia de illis et de posteris eorum conscriberetur Verbum, et hoc in se contineret caelestia, et in supremo sensu Divina, quae illi actualiter repraesentarent, ita quoque quod `Benjamin' 
quia ultimo natus est, ideo repraesentaret medium inter internum et externum, seu inter caeleste spiritualis quod fuit Domino in mundo, et inter naturale quod etiam fuit Domino, et quod Divinum faceret; 
[3]omnia {2} quae de Josepho et ejus fratribus memorantur, in supremo sensu repraesentant glorificationem Humani Domini, hoc est, quomodo Dominus Humanum in Se Divinum fecit, causa quod id in sensu 
intimo repraesentetur, est ut Verbum in sensu suo intimo sanctissimum esset; {3}ut et, quod in singulis tale in se contineret quod intraret in sapientiam angelicam; nam notum est quod sapientia angelica 
ita transcendat intelligentiam humanam ut ab homine vix quicquam capi possit inde; ipsa quoque felicitas angelorum est quod in singulis sit de Domino, nam in Domino sunt; et praeterea glorificatio 
Humani Domini est exemplar regenerationis hominis, {4} inde regeneratio hominis etiam simul in sensu interno Verbi, ubi glorificatio Domini, sistitur; regeneratio hominis cum ejus innumerabilibus arcanis 
etiam intrat in sapientiam angelicam, et sistit eorum felicitatem secundum applicationem ad usus, qui {5}sunt ad reformandum hominem. @1 ut repraesentarent caelestia et in supremo sensu Divina, 
ac de illis et posteris eorum conscriberetur Verbum, ita quoque quod Benjamin ultimo natus sit, et quod ideo quoque$ @2 i enim$ @3 ac$ @4 i et$ @5 est$ </p>
