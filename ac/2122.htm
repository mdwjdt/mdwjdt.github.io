<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2122节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2122.</strong>关于新从尘世来的灵魂，还有更多可说的。那些来自基督教界的人除了成为最大的，并拥有一切事物外，几乎没有别的想法和盘算。因此，所有人都被我欲和物欲吞噬，这些欲望（或爱）与天堂的秩序完全相反（参看<a href="2057.htm">2057</a>节）。另外，他们绝大多数人只思想肮脏、淫秽和亵渎的东西，并且彼此不谈论别的。他们也满不在乎，甚至完全鄙视关乎仁与信的一切事物。他们也不承认主自己，甚至憎恨承认祂的所有人。因为在来世，是思维和内心在说话。除此之外，由父母的可耻生活所产生的遗传之恶变得越发恶毒，就像暗中升起的大火。它们煽动人比以往任何时候都更加亵渎可敬和虔诚的事。目前，这类人正蜂拥进入来世，充满灵人界的外在和内在区域，如前所述。当邪恶开始以这种方式盛行，天平朝邪恶的那一边倾斜时，由此清楚可感知到末世即将来临，平衡必须通过弃绝那些教会中人，接纳那些教会外的人而得以恢复。</p>

As to what further regards the souls newly arriving from the world, those coming from the Christian world think and plan for scarcely anything else than to become the greatest, and to possess all things; 
so that all are devoured with the love of self and of the world, which loves are utterly contrary to heavenly order (n. 2057); besides that very many think of nothing but filthy, obscene, and profane 
things, and among themselves speak of nothing else. They also make nothing of and utterly despise all things that are of charity and faith; and do not acknowledge the Lord Himself; nay, they hate 
all who confess Him; for in the other life thoughts and hearts speak. Besides all this, on account of the infamous life of parents, hereditary evils are becoming more malignant, and like inward fires 
fostered in secret, stimulate man to greater profanation of what is honorable and pious than heretofore. At the present day such persons flock in crowds into the other life, and fill to repletion the 
exterior and interior spheres of the world of spirits, as already said. When evil thus begins to prevail, and the equilibrium begins to incline to the side of evil, it is thereby clearly perceived that 
the last time is at hand, and that the equilibrium is going to be restored by the rejection of those who are within the church, and the reception of others who are outside. </p>

As regards souls recently arrived from the world, there is more to be said. Those gathering there from the Christian world have hardly any other thought or endeavour than to be the greatest and to possess 
all things. All are accordingly eaten up with self-love and love of the world, which loves are altogether contrary to heavenly order, <a href="2057.htm">2057</a>. In addition most of them think about nothing other than 
what is filthy, disgusting, and profane, and talk about nothing else to one another. They also attach no importance to, and utterly despise, everything to do with charity and faith. Nor do they acknowledge 
the Lord Himself, indeed they hate all who confess Him; for in the next life thoughts and hearts speak. Besides this hereditary evils resulting from the shameful behaviour of parents become more 
wicked still, which like fires hidden and fostered within incite a person to greater violations of what is decent and godly than ever before. Such people are at the present time swarming into the next 
life and are filling the outer and the inner spheres of the world of spirits, as has been stated. When evil starts to prevail in this way, and the balance tilts to the side of evil, it is then clearly 
perceived that the final period is imminent and that that balance must be restored by the rejection of those inside the Church and the acceptance of others outside it. </p>

Quod animas recentes e mundo alterius attinet, illae quae ex orbe Christiano alluunt, vix aliud cogitant et moliuntur quam ut maximi sint, utque omnia possideant, ita omnes inescati amore sui et mundi, 
qui amores prorsus sunt contra ordinem caelestem, n. 2057: praeter quod plerique nihil aliud cogitent quam spurca, obscena et profana, ac inter se nihil aliud loquantur; tum quod nihili faciant et 
prorsus contemnant omnia quae sunt charitatis et fidei, Ipsum Dominum non agnoscunt, immo odio habent omnes qui Ipsam profitentur; in altera enim vita cogitata et corda loquuntur; et praeterea quod mala 
hereditaria ex flagitiosa parentum vita, maligniora fiant, quae sicut incendia intus latentia et fota, ad profaniora contra honestum et pium exstimulant hominem quam prius; tales in alteram vitam 
hodie catervatim alluunt, ei opplent sphaeram exteriorem et interiorem mundi spirituum, ut dictum: {1} cum malum ita incipit praevalere, et aequilibrium a parte mali pendere, manifeste percipitur inde 
quod ultimum tempus instet, et quod aequilibrium veniat restituendum per rejectionem (c)eorum qui intra Ecclesiam, et receptionem aliorum qui extra. 	@1 i et.$ </p>
