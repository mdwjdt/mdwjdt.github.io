<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4942节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4942.</strong>我在那里的时候，曾听见一个房屋里有一种噪音，好像有些人在墙那边试图闯进来。屋里的人被这个声音吓坏了，以为那是小偷；我被告知，那里的人被关在这种恐惧之中，好阻止他们作恶，因为恐惧是某种纠正的手段。</p>

While I was there, I heard in one of the rooms a noise as if there were some persons on the other side of the wall trying to break in. Those in the room were terrified at the sound, believing that it 
was thieves; and I was told that they who are there are kept in such fear in order that they may be deterred from evils, because fear is to some a means of amendment. </p>

While I was down there I also heard in one of the rooms a noise which sounded like people on the other side of the wall wishing to break in. Those in the room believed they were robbers and were utterly 
terrified by them. I was told that those present in this room are held in that kind of fear to deter them from evils, for with some people fear is the means by which they are corrected. </p>

</p><b>4942.</b>
{1}  Cum ibi eram, audivi etiam in una camera, sicut quod ab altera parte parietis quidam essent, qui se infringere vellent, a quibus perterriti illi qui ibi, credentes quod essent latrones; et dictum 
quod illi qui ibi, teneantur in tali timore ex causa ut deterreantur a malis, quia timor aliquibus est medium emendationis. @1 In A n. 4942 follows n. 4943, but directions are given for their transposition.$ </p>
