<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2909节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2909.</strong>“在基列亚巴，就是迦南地的希伯仑”表在教会。 这从“基列亚巴”和“迦南地的希伯仑”的含义清楚可知：“基列亚巴”是指教会的真理；“迦南地的希伯仑”是指教会的良善。在圣言，尤其在预言部分，凡论述真理的地方，也会论述良善，因为圣言的一切事物中都有天上的婚姻（参看<a href="683.htm">683</a>，<a href="793.htm">793</a>，<a href="801.htm">801</a>，<a href="2173.htm">2173</a>，<a href="2516.htm">2516</a>，<a href="2712.htm">2712</a>节）。因此，此处提及基列亚巴时，也提及“迦南地的希伯仑”。“迦南地”表主的国度（参看<a href="1413.htm">1413</a>，<a href="1437.htm">1437</a>，<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>节），那地的居所就是各种代表物（<a href="1585.htm">1585</a>，<a href="1866.htm">1866</a>节）。 <br />关于基列亚巴，就是希伯仑，它就是亚伯拉罕、以撒和雅各所住的地区。从创世记前面的章节明显可知，亚伯拉罕就在住在那里：<br />亚伯拉罕来到希伯仑幔利那里居住。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创13.18.htm">13:18</a>）<br />从后面的章节明显可知，以撒和雅各也住在那里：<br />雅各来到他父亲以撒那里，到了基列亚巴的幔利，乃是亚伯拉罕和以撒寄居的地方；基列亚巴就是希伯仑。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创35.27.htm">35:27</a>）<br />雅各也住在那里，这从约瑟的父亲派他到他哥哥那里，于是打发他出希伯仑谷明显可知（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创37.14.htm">37:14</a>）。从这三个人物的代表（如前所述）明显可知，在耶路撒冷代表教会之前，基列亚巴，就是希伯仑代表教会。<br />随着时间推移，每个教会都会衰退，直到根本不再有任何信和仁，这时它就被摧毁了。这也由“基列亚巴，就是希伯仑”来代表，也就是说，这时，这个地方被亚衲人占据，而亚衲人表示可怕的虚假信念（<a href="581.htm">581</a>，<a href="1673.htm">1673</a>节）。它被亚衲人占据的事实可参看相关经文（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民13.21.htm">13:21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民13.22.htm">22</a>；约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书11.21.htm">11:21</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/书14.15.htm">14:15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/书15.13.htm">15:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/书15.14.htm">14</a>；士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士1.10.htm">1:10</a>）。教会的终结或完结及其毁灭由约书亚彻底毁灭那地方的一切来代表（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书10.36.htm">10:36</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/书10.37.htm">37</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/书11.21.htm">11:21</a>）；亚衲人被犹大和迦勒击杀（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士1.10.htm">1:10</a>；约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书14.13.htm">14:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/书14.15.htm">15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/书15.13.htm">15:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/书15.14.htm">14</a>）。一个新教会的再度建立由分给迦勒为产业的希伯仑，包括田地和村庄来代表（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书21.12.htm">21:12</a>）。但这城本身却变成逃城（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书20.7.htm">20:7</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/书21.13.htm">21:13</a>）；给了祭司亚伦子孙的城 （约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书21.10.htm">21:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/书21.11.htm">11</a>）；犹大的产业（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书15.54.htm">15:54</a>）。<br />由此明显可知，希伯仑代表主在迦南地的属灵教会。由于同样的原因，大卫照耶和华的吩咐上希伯仑，在那里受膏作了犹大家的王；后来；后来他在那里统治了七年零六个月，又去往耶路撒冷，占领锡安（参看撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下2.1.htm">2:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下2.11.htm">11</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下5.5.htm">5:5</a>；列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上2.11.htm">2:11</a>）；就在这时，主的属灵教会才第一次开始由耶路撒冷来代表，而祂的属天教会则由锡安来代表。 </p>

In Kiriath-arba, the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan. That this signifies in the church, is evident from the signification of "Kiriath-arba," as being the church as to truth; and from the signification 
of "Hebron in the land of Canaan," as being the church as to good. In the Word, and especially in the prophetical parts, where truth is treated of, good is treated of also, because of the heavenly 
marriage in everything of the Word (see n. 683, 793, 801, 2173, 2516, 2712); therefore here, when Kiriath-arba is mentioned, it is also said, "the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan." (That the 
"land of Canaan" denotes the Lord's kingdom, may be seen above, n. 1413, 1437, 1607; also that the places in that land were variously representative, n. 1585, 1866.)  [2] In regard to Kiriath-arba which 
is Hebron, it was the region where Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob dwelt. That Abraham dwelt there, appears from what was said in a preceding chapter: "Abraham came and dwelt in Mamre, which is in Hebron" 
(Gen. 13:18). That Isaac dwelt there, appears from what is said in a later chapter: "Jacob came unto Isaac his father, to Mamre, to Kiriath-arba, the same is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned" 
(Gen. 35:27). That Jacob dwelt there is evident from Joseph being sent to his brethren by Jacob his father, from the valley of Hebron (Gen. 37:14). From the representation of the three, as spoken 
of above, it is plain that Kiriath-arba which is Hebron represented the church before Jerusalem did. [3] That every church in process of time decreases, until it has nothing left of faith and charity, 
and then is destroyed, was also represented by Kiriath-arba which is Hebron, in its being possessed by the Anakim, by whom were signified dire persuasions of falsity (n. 581, 1673). That it was possessed 
by the Anakim, may be seen in several places (Num. 13:21, 22; Josh. 11:21; 14:15; 15:13, 14; Judges 1:10); and that it came to its end or consummation and was destroyed, was represented by all 
things therein being given by Joshua to the curse (Josh. 10:36, 37; 11:21); and the Anakim being smitten by Judah and Caleb (Judges 1:10; Josh. 14:13-15; 15:13, 14). And that there was again a new church, 
was represented by Hebron being assigned to Caleb for an inheritance, as to field and villages (Josh. 21:12); but the city itself was made a city of refuge (Josh. 20:7; 21:13); and a priestly city 
for the sons of Aaron (Josh. 21:10, 11); in the inheritance of Judah (Josh. 15:54). [4] Hence it is evident that Hebron represented the Lord's spiritual church in the land of Canaan. And likewise on 
this account David was required by the command of Jehovah to go to Hebron, and was there anointed to be king over the house of Judah; and after he had reigned there seven years and six months, he went 
to Jerusalem and took possession of Zion (see 2 Sam. 2:1-11; 5:5; 1 Kings 2:11); and then for the first time the spiritual church of the Lord began to be represented by Jerusalem, and the celestial 
church by Zion. </p>

'In Kiriath Arba, which is Hebron in the land of Canaan' means within the Church. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'Kiriath Arba' as the Church as regards truth, and from the meaning of 'Hebron 
in the land of Canaan' as the Church as regards good. In the Word, especially the prophetical part, whenever truth is the subject, good also is included, on account of the heavenly marriage that exists 
in every detail of the Word, see <a href="683.htm">683</a>, <a href="793.htm">793</a>, <a href="801.htm">801</a>, <a href="2173.htm">2173</a>, <a href="2516.htm">2516</a>, <a href="2712.htm">2712</a>. Here therefore when Kiriath Arba is mentioned, so also is 'Hebron in the land of Canaan'. The land of Canaan is the Lord's kingdom, <a href="1413.htm">1413</a>, <a href="1437.htm">1437</a>, <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>, and locations in that land were in varying ways representative, <a href="1585.htm">1585</a>, <a href="1866.htm">1866</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards 'Kiriath Arba, which is Hebron', this was a region where Abraham, Isaac and Jacob dwelt. 
Abraham's dwelling there is evident from what has gone before, </p>
<blockquote>
Abraham came and dwelt in [the oak-groves of] Mamre, which are in Hebron. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2013:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 13:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
And Isaac and Jacob's dwelling there too is 
evident from what comes further on, Jacob came to Isaac his father in Mamre, to Kiriath Arba, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2035:27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 35:27</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Joseph was sent by Jacob his father to 
his brothers, from the Valley of Hebron. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2037:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 37:14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From the representation dealt with already of those three personages it is clear that 'Kiriath Arba, which is Hebron' represented the Church before 
Jerusalem did so. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the course of time every Church deteriorates until it ceases to possess any faith or charity at all, at which point it is destroyed. This too was represented by 'Kiriath 
Arba, which is Hebron', that is to say, when this place was occupied by the Anakim, by whom dreadful false persuasions were meant, <a href="581.htm">581</a>, <a href="1673.htm">1673</a>, regarding which occupation by the Anakim, see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2013:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 13:21</a>, 
<a href="22.htm">22</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%2011:21;%2014:15;%2015:13,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 11:21; 14:15; 15:13, 14</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%201:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 1:10</a>. As regards the end or close of the Church and its destruction, this was represented by Joshua's utterly destroying everything in that place, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%2010:36&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 10:36</a>, 
<a href="37.htm">37</a>; 11:21, and by Judah and Caleb's smiting the Anakim, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%201:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 1:10</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%2014:13-15;%2015:13,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 14:13-15; 15:13, 14</a>. The establishment again of a new Church was represented by the allotment of its fields and villages to 
Caleb as his inheritance, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%2021:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 21:12</a>. The city itself however became a city of refuge, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%2020:7;%2021:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 20:7; 21:13</a>, and a city for priests, for the sons of Aaron, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%2021:10,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 21:10, 11</a>, within the inheritance of Judah, 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%2015:54&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 15:54</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 From this it is evident that Hebron represented the Lord's spiritual Church in the land of Canaan. For the same reason also David was ordered by Jehovah's command to go to Hebron 
and was there anointed king over the house of Judah; and after he had reigned there for seven years and six months he went to Jerusalem and took possession of Zion, see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2%20Sam%202:1-11;%205:5;%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">2 Sam 2:1-11; 5:5; 1</a> Kings 
2:11, at which point the Lord's spiritual Church now began to be represented by Jerusalem, and His celestial Church by Zion. </p>

`In Kiriath Arba, haec Hebron in terra Canaan':  quod significet in Ecclesia, constare potest ex significatione `Kiriath Arba' quod sit Ecclesia quoad verum; et ex significatione `Hebronis in terra 
Canaan' quod sit Ecclesia quoad bonum; in Verbo, cumprimis prophetico, ubi agitur de vero, etiam agitur de bono, propter conjugium caeleste in singulis Verbi, videatur n. 683, 793, 801, 2173, 2516, 2712, 
ideo hic cum nominatur Kiriath Arba, etiam dicitur haec Hebron in terra Canaan; quod `terra Canaan' sit regnum Domini, n. 1413, 1437, 1607, et quod loca ibi varie repraesentativa fuerunt, n. 1585, 
1866.  [2] Quod Kiriath Arbam quae Hebron, attinet, fuit regio ubi habitarunt Abrahamus, Isacus et Jacobus; quod Abrahamus, patet a praecedentibus,           Venit Abraham et habitavit in [quercetis] 
Mamre, quae       in Hebrone, Gen. xiii 18: </p>
<p>quod Jishakus, patet a sequentibus,           Venit Jacob ad Jishakum patrem suum Mamre Kiriath Arba,      haec Hebron, ubi peregrinatus est Abraham et 
Jishak, Gen.xxxv      27: </p>
<p>quod Jacob,           Joseph a patre suo Jacobo missus ad fratres e valle       Hebronis, Gen. xxxvii 14; </p>
<p>ex repraesentatione trium illorum, de qua prius, constat quod 
`Kiriath Arba, quae Hebron' repraesentaverit Ecclesiam prius quam Hierosolyma:  [3] quod omnis Ecclesia successu temporis decrescat usque dum nihil fidei et charitatis residuum habeat, et quod tunc destruatur, 
repraesentatum etiam fuit per `Kiriath Arbam quae Hebron,' quod nempe `possessa ab Anakis,' per quos significatae sunt dirae persuasiones falsi, n. 581, 1673, quod `possessa ab Anakis,' videatur 
Num. xiii 21, 22; Jos. xi 21; xiv 15; xv 13, 14, Jud. i 10; et quod finis seu consummatio ejus, et destructa, repraesentatum est per quod `omnia ibi a Joshua devotioni data,' Jos. x 36, 37; xi 21, 
et `Anaki percussi a Jehuda et a Calebo,' Jud. i 10; Jos. xiv 13-15; xv 13, 14; et quod nova iterum Ecclesia, repraesentatum est per quod `cesserit Calebo in hereditatem quoad agrum et villas,' Jos. 
xxi 12; ipsa urbs autem facta urbs refugii, Jos. xx 7; xxi 13, et sacerdotalis filiis Aharonis, Jos. xxi 10, 11; in hereditate Jehudae, Jos. xv 54; [4] inde patet quod Hebron repraesentaverit Ecclesiam 
spiritualem Domini in terra Canaane; ideo quoque David ex mandato Jehovae ire jussus est Hebronem, et ibi unctus est in regem super domum Jehudae; et postquam ibi regnaverat septem annis et sex mensibus, 
Hierosolymam ivit, et occupavit Zionem, videatur 2 Sam. ii 1-11; v 5; I Reg. ii 11, et tunc primum repraesentari coepit Ecclesia spiritualis Domini per `Hierosolymam,' et caelestis per `Zionem.' </p>
