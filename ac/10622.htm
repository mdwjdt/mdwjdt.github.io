<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10622节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10622</strong>.“绝不赦免”表允许它们存在，直到它们到达终结的阶段。这从“赦免”的含义清楚可知。“赦免”是指赦罪；但当经上补充说“不赦免”时，所表示的是允许事物存在。之所以表示直到它们终结的阶段，是因为主允许邪恶存在，直到它到达自己终结的阶段，或它的顶点。圣言的各个地方都提到了“时代的完结”；在这些地方，论到邪恶，经上会说它“满盈”或没有“满盈”，也就是说它已经达到或没有达到它的终结阶段或完结；在终结阶段或完结时，或说当它满盈时，察罚就会发生。由于这就是“绝不赦免”这句话的意思，所以必须简要说明当如何理解这句话。一般来说，终结阶段或完结表示教会的结束。当仁与信不复存在时，教会的结束就到来了，因为教会完全背离主，不再处于任何良善，而是陷入邪恶。这就是所谓的教会终结或完结，在这个阶段，察罚会发生。当察罚发生时，凡陷入邪恶的人都被抛弃，凡处于良善的人都被接受。这种察罚发生在来世，在那里，自教会开始直到教会结束，凡属于教会的人都住在一起。那时，恶人被扔进地狱，善人则得救，这就是那被称为“最后审判”的。<br />具体的终结阶段或完结则以几乎相同的方式发生在每个人身上。每个人在进入来世时（这种情况死后随即发生），都被允许在善人中间；即便是坏人也可以。但一段时间过后，他的内层就被打开。如果这些内层是邪恶的，他就会逐渐被带入自己的邪恶，直到他的意愿被其邪恶占据，他的理解力被其邪恶的虚假占据。一旦发生这种情况，邪恶可以说在他里面达到它的终结阶段，或说满盈，然后他被扔进地狱。这些就是“绝不赦免”所表示的事。耶和华对摩西说的话所表相同，即：<br />现在，去吧！你领这百姓往我所告诉你的地方去；看哪，我的使者必在走你前头；只是在我察罚的日子，我必察罚他们的罪。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出32.34.htm">32:34</a>）<br />终结或完结表示教会的结束，这一点从下列经文明显看出来，耶利米书：<br />论到以色列和犹大，我必不带来完结，但也不待你如无罪的，因为你的破口没有希望，你的伤痕严重。你没有医治的良药。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶30.4.htm">30:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶30.11.htm">11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶30.13.htm">13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶46.28.htm">46:28</a>）<br />耶利米哀歌：<br />锡安的女儿哪，你的罪孽已经完结。以东的女儿哪，祂必察罚你的罪孽，显露你的罪恶。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀4.22.htm">4:22</a>）<br />但以理书：<br />为你的民已经定了七十个七，使过犯完结，封住罪恶，赎尽罪孽。最后荒凉必临到可憎的飞鸟，直到完结……（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但9.24.htm">9:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但9.27.htm">27</a>）<br />马太福音：<br />收割的时候就是这时代的完结。将稗子薅出来用火焚烧，这时代完结的时候也要如此。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.39.htm">13:39</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.40.htm">40</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />门徒对耶稣说，请告诉我们，你降临和时代的完结，有什么预兆呢？（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.3.htm">24:3</a>）<br /><br />耶稣说，看哪，我终日与你们同在，直到时代的完结。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.20.htm">28:20</a>）</p>

And in absolving will not absolve. That this signifies bearing even to the consummation, is evident from the signification of "absolving," as being to forgive sin; but when it is added, "will not absolve" 
it denotes to bear. That it denotes even to the consummation, is because evil is borne by the Lord even until it is consummated or fulfilled. In the Word throughout mention is made of the "consummation 
of the age," and it is said of evil that it has been "consummated," or "not consummated;" and when it is consummated, that then there is "visitation." As this is signified by the words, "in absolving 
will not absolve," it shall be briefly told what is meant there by. In general, by "consummation" is meant the end of the church; and the end of the church is when there is no longer any charity 
or any faith, because then the church turns itself completely away from the Lord, and is no longer in any good, but in evil. Then is its "consummation," and then takes place its "visitation." When 
visitation takes place, all those who are in evil are rejected, and all those who are in good are received. Visitation takes place in the other life, where all those who have been of the church, from 
its beginning even to its end, are together. The rejection at that time of the evil into hell, and the salvation of the good, is what is called the "Last Judgment."  [2] Consummation takes place in particular 
with every man in almost the same way. Every person, when he comes into the other life, which takes place immediately after death, is tolerated among the good, even if he is evil. But after 
some lapse of time his interiors are opened, and if these are evil he is then gradually carried into his evil, until he becomes his evil in respect to the will, and the falsity of his evil in respect 
to the understanding. When this is done, evil is said to be "consummated" with him, and he is then cast into hell. These are the things which are meant by "in absolving will not absolve." The like is 
signified by what Jehovah said unto Moses: "Now go, lead the people unto that which I said to thee; behold, Mine angel shall go before thee; and in the day of My visitation, I will visit their sin upon 
them" (Exod. 32:34). [3] That "consummation" denotes the end of the church, is evident from the following passages: </p>
<p>     With Israel and with Judah I will not make a consummation; nor rendering will 
I render thee innocent, because thy breach is despaired of, thy wound is sick, thou hast no healing medicines (Jer. 30:4, 11-13; 46:28).      Thine iniquity is consummated, O daughter of Zion; He 
will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; He will make plain thy sins (Lam. 4:22).      Seventy weeks have been decreed upon thy people, to consummate the transgression, and to seal up sins, and 
to expiate iniquity. At last upon the bird of abominations shall be desolation, and even unto the consummation (Dan. 9:24, 27).      The harvest is the consummation of the age; as the tares are gathered 
together and burned with fire, so shall it be in the consummation of the age (Matt. 13:39, 40).      The disciples said unto Jesus, Tell us what is the sign of Thy coming, and of the consummation 
of the age (Matt. 24:3).      Jesus said, Lo, I am with you all the days even unto the consummation of the age (Matt. 28:20). </p>

'And He does not at all absolve' means allowing them to exist until they reach their closing stage. This is clear from the meaning of 'absolving' as forgiving sin; but when the words does or will not 
absolve are added<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>, allowing the thing to exist is meant. The reason why until their closing stage is meant is that the Lord allows evil to exist until it has reached its closing stage or culmination. 
Various places throughout the Word use the expression 'the close of the age'; and in these places evil may be spoken of as having reached or not having reached its closing stage, at which stage visitation 
takes place. Since this is the meaning of the words 'He does (or will) not at all absolve' a brief statement must be made showing what to understand by this. In general the closing stage or the 
close means the end of the Church. And it reaches its end when neither charity nor faith exist any longer, because the Church has turned itself completely away from the Lord and no good at all reigns 
there any longer, only evil. This is called its close, at which stage visitation takes place. When it takes place all those ruled by evil are cast away, and all those governed by good are accepted. This 
visitation takes place in the next life, where all who have belonged to the Church from its beginning through to its end dwell together. The casting away of the evil into hell when it takes place 
and the saving of the good is what is called the last judgement.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In particular the closing stage takes place with every individual person in a very similar manner. When anybody enters the next 
life, which happens immediately after death, he is allowed to exist among those who are good; even someone bad is allowed to do so. But after a while the person's interiors are opened. If these are evil 
he is borne away more and more into his own evil, until his will is taken over by his evil, and his understanding by the falsity which goes with that evil. Once this has happened that evil is said 
to have reached the closing stage in him, and he is cast away into hell. These are the things that should be understood by 'He will not at all absolve'. The like is meant by what Jehovah said to Moses, 
 </p>
<blockquote>
Now, go! lead the people to what I have spoken of to you. Behold, My angel will go before you; and on the day of My visitation I will visit their sin upon them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2032:34&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 32:34</a>.

<p><b>[3]</b>
 The fact that 
the close means the end of the Church is clear from the following places: In Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
With Israel and with Judah I will not bring about the close<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a>, but I will not treat you as one who is at all 
innocent<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a>, because there is no hope for your fracture; the wound is grievous. You have no restorative medicaments. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2030:11-13;%2046:28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 30:11-13; 46:28</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
Your iniquity, O daughter of Zion, 
has been brought to a close. He will visit your iniquity, O daughter of Edom, He will reveal your sins. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lam%204:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lam 4:22</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In Daniel,  </p>
<blockquote>
Seventy weeks have been decreed concerning your people, to bring 
transgression to a close and to seal up sins and to atone for iniquity. At length upon the bird of abominations will come desolation; and until the close ... <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%209:24,27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 9:24,27</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
The 
harvest is the close of the age. As the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so will it be at the close of the age. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:39,40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13:39,40</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the same gospel,  </p>
<blockquote>
The disciples said to Jesus, Tell 
us, what will be the sign of Your coming and of the close of the age? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2024:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 24:3</a>.

`Et absolvendo non {1}absolvit':  quod significet tolerantiam usque ad consummationem, constat ex significatione `absolvere' quod sit peccatum remittere, at cum additur non absolvet, est tolerare; quod 
sit usque ad consummationem, est quia a Domino malum toleratur usque dum consummatum seu impletum est.  In Verbo {2}passim dicitur consummatio saeculi, et de malo quod consummatum sit vel non consummatum; 
et quando consummatum{3}, quod tunc visitatio; hoc quia significatur per illa verba `absolvendo non absolvet,' paucis dicetur quid per id intelligitur:  {4}in communi per consummationem intelligitur 
finis Ecclesiae; et tunc finis ejus est quando amplius nulla charitas et nulla fides, quia tunc Ecclesia se prorsus {5}avertit a Domino, et non amplius in  aliquo bono est sed in malo; tunc dicitur 
consummatio ejus, et {6} tunc fit visitatio; cum visitatio{7}, rejiciuntur omnes illi qui in malo sunt, et recipiuntur omnes qui in bono; visitatio {8} fit in altera vita ubi omnes simul sunt qui 
fuerunt ab Ecclesia a principio ejus usque ad finem ejus; rejectio malorum in infernum, et salvatio bonorum tunc, est quae vocatur ultimum judicium. 	[2] In {9}particulari fit consummatio apud unumquemvis 
hominem paene similiter; quilibet cum in alteram vitam venit, quod fit statim post mortem, toleratur inter bonos, tametsi malus; sed post aliquem elapsum temporis aperiuntur interiora ejus; si 
haec mala, tunc per gradus fertur in suum malum, usque ut sit suum malum quoad voluntatem, et sui mali falsum quoad intellectum; hoc facto malum dicitur consummatum apud illum, et tunc conjicitur in 
infernum; haec sunt quae intelliguntur per {10}`absolvendo non absolvet':   [3] {11}simile per quod Jehovah {12}dixit ad Moschen, 	Nunc vade, duc populum ad quod dixi tibi; ecce angelus Meus ibit coram 
te; et in die visitationis Meae visitabo super illos peccatum eorum, Exod. xxxii 34. Quod consummatio sit finis Ecclesiae, constat ex his sequentibus:  apud Jeremiam, 	Cum Israele et cum Jehuda 
non faciam consummationem, nec innocentem reddendo reddam te, quia desperatum est confractioni tuae; aegra plaga est, medicamenta restitutionis non tibi, (x)xxx 11-13, xlvi 28: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Consummata 
est iniquitas tua, filia Zion; visitabit iniquitatem tuam, filia Edomi, manifestabit peccata tua, Threni iv 22: </p>
<p>apud Danielem, 	Septimanae septuaginta decisae sunt super populum tuum, ad consummandum 
praevaricationem, et ad obsignandum peccata, et ad expiandum iniquitatem:  tandem super avem abominationum desolatio, et usque ad consummationem, ix 24, 27: </p>
