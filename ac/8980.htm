<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8980节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8980.</strong>“他的女人就可以同他出去”表一种与快乐联结，以及争战之后的真理状态。这从“出去”和“女人”的含义清楚可知：“出去”，即从服事或奴役中出去，是指争战之后的一种状态（参看<a href="8975.htm">8975</a>节）；“女人”是指被联结的快乐，如刚才所述（<a href="8979.htm">8979</a>节）。由此明显可知此处“奴仆”究竟代表谁，即代表那些充满构成其教会教义的信仰，却未充满相应的良善，而是充满模仿相应良善的一种快乐之人。他们服事他们的主人表示他们在能被引入天堂之前的状态，他们出去，不再服事表示他们被接入天堂时的状态。但他们因只充满构成其教会教义的信仰，却未充满相应的良善，因而未充满良善之真理，也就是仁之信，故无法被允许深入天堂，只能到天堂的入口处。因为那些在天堂入口处的人通过信之真理与天堂之内的人相接触，通过与那真理联结的快乐与天堂之外的人相接触。他们就像覆盖身体的皮肤层或膜，通过触觉与世界相接触，通过神经系统与身体中灵魂的生命相接触。正因如此，由“希伯来奴仆”所代表的天堂入口处的人在大人里面被称为皮肤灵或表皮（关于他们，可参看<a href="5552.htm">5552</a>-<a href="5559.htm">5559</a>节）。不过，这类灵人有许多属与种，和覆盖身体的皮肤层或膜一样。有些皮肤层或膜覆盖整个身体；有些则覆盖总体上的内层部分，如腹膜、胸膜或心包膜；有些则专门用来覆盖那里的各个器官。他们相对来说都是一群仆人。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8980</b></p><p><b>8980.</b>
Then his woman shall go out with him. That this signifies a state of truth with delight also conjoined after combat, is evident from the signification of "going out," namely, from service, as being the 
state after combat (see n. 8975); and from the signification of "a woman," as being the conjoined delight (of which just above, n. 8979). From all this it is evident who were here represented by menservants, 
namely, they who are in the faith of the doctrinal things of their church, and not in the corresponding good, but in a delight which counterfeits the corresponding good. Their service with 
their master signifies their state before they can be admitted into heaven, and their going out from service signifies their state when they are received into heaven. But as they are merely in the faith 
of the doctrinal things of their church, and not in the corresponding good, thus not in the truth of good, that is, in the faith of charity, therefore they cannot be admitted further into heaven than 
to the entrance of it. For they who are in the entrance to heaven communicate by the truth which is of faith with those who are in heaven, and by delight conjoined with truth with those who are outside 
of heaven-no otherwise than as do the skins or coats which encompass the body, which by the sense of touch communicate with the world, and by a fibrous connection, with the life of the soul in the 
body. From this it is that they who are in the entrance to heaven, and are represented by the Hebrew servants, are called "the cuticulars" in the Grand Man (n. 5552-5559). But such are of as many genera 
and species as are the cuticles or coats in the body; for there are those which encompass the whole body; there are those which encompass the interiors in general, as the peritoneum, the pleura, 
the pericardium; and there are those which specifically encompass each of the viscera therein. All are relatively things of service. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8980</b></p><p><b>8980.</b>
'His woman shall go out with him' means a state of truth together with delight joined to it, also after conflict. This is clear from the meaning of 'going out' - out of servitude - as a state after conflict, <a href="8975.htm">8975</a>; and from the meaning of 'woman' as conjoined delight, dealt with immediately above in <a href="8979.htm">8979</a>. From these places it is evident who exactly were represented here by 'male slaves', namely those 
imbued with faith composed of the teachings of their Church and not with the complementary good but with delight that is an imitation of that good. Their servitude with their master means their state 
before they can be introduced into heaven, whereas their going out from servitude means their state when they are received into heaven. But since they are imbued only with faith composed of the teachings 
of their Church and not with the complementary good, thus not with the truth of good, which is the faith of charity, they cannot be allowed any further into heaven than the entrance there. For 
those in the entrance to heaven are in contact with those in heaven through the truth of faith, and with those outside heaven through the delight joined to that truth. They serve just like the layers 
of skin or membranes that clothe the body, which through the sense of touch are in contact with the world and through the nervous system are in contact with the life of the soul present in the body. 
So it is that those in the entrance to heaven, who are represented by 'Hebrew slaves', are called skin spirits in the Grand Man, regarding whom see <a href="5552.htm">5552</a>-<a href="5559.htm">5559</a>. But there are many genera and species of 
such spirits, just as there are of layers of skin or membranes in the body. There are those which cover the whole body; there are those which cover interior parts in general, such as the peritoneum, pleura, 
or pericardium; and there are those which serve specifically to cover the individual organs there. They are all relatively a body of servants. </p>

`Et exibit mulier illius cum illo': quod significet statum veri cum jucundo conjuncto etiam post pugnam, constat ex significatione `exire,' nempe ex servitio, quod sit status post pugnam, {1}n. 8975, 
et ex significatione `mulieris' quod sit jucundum conjunctum, de qua mox supra n. 8979.  Ex his patet quinam hic per `servos' repraesentati {2}sunt, quod nempe illi qui in fide doctrinalium Ecclesiae 
suae {3}sunt et non in bono correspondente sed in jucundo quod mentitur bonum correspondens; servitium illorum apud dominum suum significat statum illorum antequam in caelum possunt immitti, at exitus 
(c)ex servitio significat statum illorum cum in caelum {4}recipiuntur; sed quia {5}solum in fide doctrinalium Ecclesiae suae sunt et non in bono correspondente, ita non in vero boni, hoc est, in fide 
charitatis, ideo non ulterius in caelum intromitti queunt quam ad introitum ibi; qui enim in introitu ad caelum sunt communicant per verum quod fidei cum illis qui in caelo sunt , et per jucundum vero 
conjunctum cum illis qui extra caelum, non aliter ac {6}faciunt cutes seu tunicae quae cingunt corpus; hae {7} per sensum tactus communicant cum mundo, et per nexum fibrosum cum vita animae in corpore; 
inde est quod qui in introitu ad caelum sunt, et repraesentantur per servos Hebraeos, cuticulares in Maximo Homine dicantur, de quibus videatur n. 5552-5559.  Sed tales sunt plurium generum et specierum, 
sicut sunt cuticulae seu tunicae in corpore; hae {7} sunt quae cingunt totum corpus, sunt quae cingunt interiora in communi, sicut peritonaeum, pleura, pericardium, et sunt quae in specie singula 
viscera ibi; omnes {8} sunt respective servitia. @1 i nam per servitium sex annorum significatur status laboris et alicujus pugnae,$ @2 sint$ @3 After correspondente$ @4 recipi possunt$ @5
