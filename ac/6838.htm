Verses 4-6. And Jehovah saw that he went aside to see, and God called unto him out of the midst of the bramble, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Behold me! And He said, Draw not nigh hither; pull 
off thy shoes from upon thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest a ground of holiness is this. And He said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. 
And Moses covered his faces, because he was afraid to look upon God. "And Jehovah saw that he went aside to see," signifies reflection from the Lord; "and God called unto him," signifies influx from 
the Divine; "out of the midst of the bramble," signifies from the truths of memory-knowledge; "and said, Moses, Moses; and he said, behold me!" signifies internal exhortation, and hearing; "and He said, 
Draw not nigh hither," signifies that he must not still think of the Divine from sensuous things; "pull off thy shoes from upon thy feet," signifies that sensuous things, which are the externals of 
the natural, must be removed; "for the place whereon thou standest a ground of holiness is this," signifies that otherwise the Divine cannot enter; "and He said, I am the God of thy father," signifies 
the Divine which was of the Ancient Church; "the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob," signifies the Divine Itself, and the Divine Human, thus the Lord; "and Moses covered his faces," 
signifies that the interiors were guarded; "because he was afraid to look upon God," signifies lest they should be injured by the presence of the Divine Itself. </p>

Verses 4-6 And Jehovah saw that he turned aside to see, and God called to him from the middle of the bramble bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here I am. And He said, Do not draw near here; 
take off your shoes from upon your feet, for the place which you are standing on is holy ground. And He said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And 
Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.  </p>
<p>'And Jehovah saw that he turned aside to see' means reflection brought about by the Lord. 'And Jehovah' called to him' means an influx from 
the Divine. 'From the middle of the bramble bush' means out of true factual knowledge. 'And said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here I am' means a warning from within, and a heeding. 'And He said, Do not 
draw near here' means that in thinking about the Divine he should not do so as yet with the powers of the senses. 'Take off your shoes from upon your feet' means that the powers of the senses, which 
form the external levels of the natural, should be removed. 'For the place which you are standing on is holy ground' means that otherwise the Divine cannot come in. 'And He said, I am the God of your 
father' means Him who was the God of the Ancient Church. 'The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob' means the Divine itself and the Divine Human, thus the Lord. 'And Moses hid his face' 
means that interior things were protected. 'For he was afraid to look at God' means for fear that they should suffer harm from the presence of the Divine itself. </p>

Vers. 4-6.  Et vidit Jehovah quod secederet ad videndum, et vocavit ad illum Deus e medio rubi, et dixit, Moscheh, Moscheh, et dixit, Ecce me.  Et dixit, Ne appropinques huc, detrahe calceos tuos e 
super pedibus tuis, quia locus quo tu stas super, humus sanctitatis ille.  Et dixit, Ego Deus patris tui, Deus Abrahami, Deus Jischaki, et Deus Jacobi; et obtexit Moscheh facies suas, quia timuit ab intuendo 
Deum.  `Et vidit Jehovah quod secederet ad videndum' significat reflexionem a Domino: `et vocavit ad illum Jehovah' significat influxum a Divino: `a medio rubi' significat e veris scientificis: 
`et dixit, Moscheh, Moscheh, et dixit, Ecce me' significat exhortationem internam, et auditionem: `et dixit, Ne appropinques huc' significat quod non de Divino cogitaret adhuc ex sensualibus: `detrahe 
calceos tuos e super pedibus tuis, significat quod sensualia, quae sunt externa naturalis, removerentur: `quia locus quo tu stas super, humus sanctitatis ille' significat quod alioquin Divinum intrare 
nequeat: `et dixit, Ego Deus patris tui' significat Divinum quod Antiquae Ecclesiae: `Deus Abrahami, Deus Jischaki, et Deus Jacobi' significat Ipsum Divinum (c)et Divinum Humanum, ita Dominum: `et 
obtexit Moscheh facies suas' significat quod interiora tutarentur: `quia timuit ab intuendo Deum' significat ne laederentur a praesentia Ipsius Divini. </p>
