<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3448节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3448.</strong>“他的同伴亚户撒、他的军长非各”表其信之教义的首要特征。这从“亚比米勒”的代表清楚可知，“亚比米勒”是指关注理性事物的信之教义。因此，“他的同伴和他的军长”表那些首要事物，事实上是其教义的首要事物；因为“军长”和“首领”一样，表示首要事物（<a href="1482.htm">1482</a>，<a href="2089.htm">2089</a>节）；“军（队）” 表示教义事物本身。“军队”之所以表示属于真理或为低级真理的教义事物，是因为在圣言中，“作战”和“战争”是指那些与属灵的作战并战争有关的事物（<a href="1664.htm">1664</a>，<a href="1788.htm">1788</a>，<a href="2686.htm">2686</a>节）。“武器”也一样，如“枪”、“盾”、“弓”、“箭”、“剑”等等，这在别处已经说明。由于它们是进行属灵争战所借助的真理或教义事物，故“军队”表示这些真理或教义事物，在反面意义上则表示虚假或异端思想。<br />在圣言中，“军队”或“天象”是指真理或虚假。这一点从许多经文可以看出来，如但以理书：<br />公山羊的一角向南、向东、向荣美之地，渐渐成为强大。它渐渐强大，高及天象，将些天象和星宿抛落在地，并践踏它们。并且它自高自大，直达天象之君。因罪过的缘故，有军队和常献的燔祭交付它；它将真理抛在地上。我听见有一位圣者说话，又有一位圣者问那说话的圣者说，这经常献的祭、带来荒凉的罪过、圣所与军队被践踏的异象，要持续到几时呢？（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.9.htm">8:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.13.htm">13</a>）<br />“向南、向东、向荣美之地，渐渐成为强大的角”是指源于邪恶的虚假的力量（<a href="2832.htm">2832</a>节）；“天象”是指真理；“天象之君”是指主的神圣真理。就正面意义而言，“军队”或“天象”是指真理，故经上说那角“将天象抛落在地”，然后又说“它将真理抛在地上”。<br /><br />北方王必回来摆列大军，比先前的更多，满了所定的年数，他必率领大军，带极多的装备来。他必奋力鼓勇，率领大军攻击南方王，南方王也必以极大极强的军兵去作战，却站立不住，因为吃王膳的，必败坏他，他的军队必被冲没，仆倒被杀的甚多。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但11.13.htm">11:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但11.25.htm">25</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但11.26.htm">26</a>）<br />这一整章论述的主题是北方王和南方王之间的战争；“北方王”表示虚假，他的“军队”也是；“南方王”和他的“军队”表示真理。这是关于教会荒废的预言。<br />启示录：<br />我看见天开了，见有一匹白马，骑在马上的称为诚信真实。他穿着溅了血的衣服。在天上的众军骑着白马，穿着细麻衣，又白又洁，跟随他。我看见那兽和地上的君王，并他们的众军都聚集，要与骑马的并他的军队争战。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.11.htm">19:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.13.htm">13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.19.htm">19</a>）<br />“骑白马的”表主的圣言，或圣言方面的主（<a href="2760.htm">2760</a>-<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>节）；“跟随他的天上众军”表来自圣言的真理，因而表天上那些拥有真理的人；“兽”表属于自我之爱的邪恶；“地上的君王并他们的众军”表虚假。此处描述的是虚假与真理的争战。<br />诗篇：<br />诸天藉耶和华的话而造；其万象藉祂口中的气而成。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗33.6.htm">33:6</a>）<br />“其万象”或天象表真理。由于“军队”表真理，故王国之子和天使凭他们所拥有的真理而被称为天军或天兵或天象，如路加福音：<br />忽然，有一大队天兵同那天使赞美神。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路2.13.htm">2:13</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />你们作祂的诸军，作祂的仆役，行他所喜悦的，都要称颂耶和华！（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗103.21.htm">103:21</a>）<br /><br />祂的众使者都要赞美祂，祂的诸军都要赞美祂。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗148.2.htm">148:2</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />你们向上举目，看谁创造这万象，按数目领出它们。他一一称其名，因他大有权柄，满有能力，连一个都不缺。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.26.htm">40:26</a>）<br /><br />我造地，又造人在地上；我亲手铺张诸天，天上万象也是我所命定的。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.12.htm">45:12</a>）<br />此处“天上万象”表真理，因而表天使，因为他们拥有真理，如前所述。<br />列王纪：<br />我看见耶和华坐在宝座上，天上的万军侍立在祂左右。（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上22.19.htm">22:19</a>）<br />约珥书：<br />耶和华在祂军旅前发声，他的营兵甚大；遵行祂命令的是强盛者。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.11.htm">2:11</a>）<br />撒迦利亚书：<br />我必在我家的四围安营，使敌军不得任意往来，暴虐的人也不再经过。锡安的女子哪，应当大大喜乐！耶路撒冷的女子哪，应当欢呼！看哪，你的王来到你这里！（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚9.8.htm">9:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚9.9.htm">9</a>）<br />这论述的是主的到来；祂的“军队”表神圣真理。由于这个原因，还因为唯独主为人与不断奋力攻击他的地狱争战，所以在圣言中，主经常被称为“万军之耶和华”、“万军之神”、“万军之主”，也就是耶和华、神，或万主之主，如以赛亚书：<br />列族之国聚集哄嚷的声音；万军之耶和华点齐军队，预备打仗。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.4.htm">13:4</a>）<br />“列族之国”表源邪恶的虚假；“点齐军队，预备打仗”表代表人争战。<br />由于以色列的十二支派代表主的天国，并且“支派”，以及“十二”表作为一个整体的信的一切事物，也就是该国度的一切真理（<a href="577.htm">577</a>，<a href="2089.htm">2089</a>，<a href="2129.htm">2129</a>，<a href="2130.htm">2130</a>，<a href="3272.htm">3272</a>节），故他们还被称为“耶和华的军队”（如出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出7.4.htm">7:4</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.17.htm">12:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.41.htm">41</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.51.htm">51</a>）；并且还要按着“他们的军队”把他们从埃及领出来（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出6.26.htm">6:26</a>）；要“照他们的军队”各归本营（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民1.52.htm">1:52</a>）；要分散到他们的“军队”中（民数记2章）。<br />“军队”是指真理，这也明显可见于以西结书：<br />波斯人、路德人、弗人在你军队中作你的战士。他们在你中间悬挂盾牌和头盔，彰显你的尊荣。亚发人和你的军队都在你四围的墙上，你的望楼也有歌玛底人。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.10.htm">27:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.11.htm">11</a>）<br /><br />这论及推罗，推罗表示对良善与真理的内在认知，因而那些拥有它们的人（<a href="1201.htm">1201</a>节）；“军队”表真理本身；“路德人、弗人”也是指那些拥有认知的人（参看<a href="1163.htm">1163</a>，<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1166.htm">1166</a>，<a href="1195.htm">1195</a>，<a href="1231.htm">1231</a>节）；“盾牌和头盔”是指诸如属于属灵争战或战争之类的事物<br />就反面意义而言，“军队”表虚假。这一点明显可见于以赛亚书：<br />到那日，耶和华在高处必惩罚高处的众军，在地上必惩罚地上的列王。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.21.htm">24:21</a>）<br />此处“高处的众军”表由自我之爱所产生的虚假。以西结书：<br />我要把你掉转过来，用钩子钩住你的腮颊，将你和你的军队、马匹、马兵带出来，都披挂整齐，成了大队，有大牌小盾，都拿刀剑。你从你的地方，从北方极处率领同你一起的许多民族前来，他们都骑着马，是一大队强盛的军兵。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结38.4.htm">38:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结38.15.htm">15</a>）<br />这论及哥革，他表示脱离内在的外在敬拜，因而变成偶像崇拜（<a href="1151.htm">1151</a>节）；他的“军队”表虚假。<br />耶利米书：<br />我要派弓箭手，他要拉弓，贯甲挺身，射向巴比伦；不要怜惜她的少年人，要灭尽她的全军。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.2.htm">51:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.3.htm">3</a>）<br />“巴比伦”表外在显得神圣，而内在却是亵渎的敬拜（<a href="1182.htm">1182</a>，<a href="1283.htm">1283</a>，<a href="1295.htm">1295</a>，<a href="1304.htm">1304</a>，<a href="1306.htm">1306</a>-<a href="1308.htm">1308</a>，<a href="1321.htm">1321</a>，<a href="1322.htm">1322</a>，<a href="1326.htm">1326</a>节）；“她的全军”表具有这类内在亵渎的虚假，在其它经文中，巴比伦的军队也有这样的含义（如耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶32.2.htm">32:2</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶34.1.htm">34:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶34.21.htm">21</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶39.1.htm">39:1</a>）。以西结书：<br />法老看见他们，便为他的众人、法老和他的全军被剑刺死受安慰。因为我将对我的畏惧放在活人之地。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结32.31.htm">32:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结32.32.htm">32</a>）<br />这论及埃及，埃及表示那些通过基于记忆知识的推理而歪曲真理的人（<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>节）；他的“全军”或法老的军队表由此而来的虚假；在其它经文中，“法老的军队”也是这个意思（如耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶37.5.htm">37:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶37.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶37.11.htm">11</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶46.2.htm">46:2</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结17.17.htm">17:17</a>）。路加福音：<br />你们看见耶路撒冷被军队围困，那时就可以知道她的荒凉近了。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路21.20.htm">21:20</a>）<br />这论及世代的末了，或教会的末期，这时信不复存在。“耶路撒冷”表教会（参看<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>节），当被虚假围困时，它就被“军队围困”。<br />从上述经文明显可知，犹太人和以色列人的偶像崇拜者所崇拜的“天象（或天军或天兵）”在内义上表示虚假，论到他们，列王纪上说：<br />他们离弃耶和华他们神的一切诫命，为自己铸了两个牛犊的像，立了亚舍拉，敬拜天上的万象。（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下17.16.htm">17:16</a>）<br />这论及以色列人；在另一处，经上论到玛拿西说：<br />他为天上的万象筑坛。（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下21.5.htm">21:5</a>）<br /><br />约西亚王将那为巴力和亚舍拉并天上万象所造的器皿，都从殿里搬出来。（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下23.4.htm">23:4</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />他们必将首领的骸骨、祭司的骸骨、先知的骸骨取出来，抛散在日头、月亮、和天上的万象之下，就是他们从前所喜爱、所事奉、所随从的。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶8.1.htm">8:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶8.2.htm">2</a>）<br /><br />耶路撒冷的房屋和犹大君王的宫殿，就是一切房屋，他们在那些房顶上向天上万象烧香或向别神浇奠祭的，都要像陀斐特一样成为不洁。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶19.13.htm">19:13</a>）<br /> 西番雅书：<br />我必伸手攻击那些在房顶上敬拜天上万象的。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番1.4.htm">1:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/番1.5.htm">5</a>）<br />被称为“天上万象”的，主要是众星，“众星”是指真理，在反面意义上则指虚假（<a href="1128.htm">1128</a>，<a href="1808.htm">1808</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3448</b></p><p><b>3448.</b>
And Ahuzzath his companion, and Phicol the captain of his army. That this signifies the primaries of the doctrine of their faith, is evident from the representation of Abimelech, as being the doctrine 
of faith that looks to rational things; hence "his companion and the captain of his army" signify these primaries, and indeed the primaries which are of doctrine; for a "captain," like a "prince," signifies 
the things that are primary (n. 1482, 2089); and an "army" signifies the doctrinal things themselves. That an "army" signifies the doctrinal things that are of truth, or that are lower truths, 
is because by "warfare" in the Word, and by "war," are signified the things that are of spiritual warfare and war (n. 1664, 1788, 2686); as also by "arms," such as spears," "shields," "bows," "arrows," 
"swords," and the like, as has been shown elsewhere. And because it is truths or doctrinal things by means of which spiritual combats are waged, therefore by "armies" these are signified; and also 
in the opposite sense things false or heretical. [2] That both are signified in the Word by "armies," may be seen from many passages, as in Daniel: </p>
<p>     One horn of the he-goat grew exceedingly toward 
the south, and toward the sunrise, and toward beauty. And it grew even to the army of the heavens, and some of the army and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them. Yea, it 
magnified itself, even to the Prince of the army. His army was given over with the continual sacrifice to transgression; and it cast down truth to the ground. I heard a holy one speaking; and another 
holy one said, How long shall be this vision, the continual sacrifice, and the transgression that wasteth, to give both the sanctuary and the army to be trampled down? (Dan. 8:9-13); </p>
<p>the "horn which 
grew toward the south, toward the sunrise, and toward beauty," is the power of falsity from evil (n. 2832); the "armies of the heavens" are truths; the "Prince of the army" is the Lord as to Divine truth; 
and because in a good sense an "army" is truth, it is said that the horn "cast down of the army to the ground," and afterwards that it "cast truth to the ground." [3] Again: </p>
<p>     The king of the 
north* shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and he shall come on at the end of the times of years, coming with a great army, and with much substance. And he shall stir up his power 
and his heart against the king of the south, with a great army; and the king of the south shall war in battle with an exceeding great and mighty army; but he shall not stand, for they that eat of his 
meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow; and many shall fall down slain (Dan. 11:13, 25-26). The subject of this whole chapter is the war between the king of the north and the king of the 
south; and by the "king of the north" are meant falsities, as also by his "army;" and by the "king of the south" and his "army" are meant truths: it is a prophecy of the vastation of the church. [4] 
In John: </p>
<p>     I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse, and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true. He was clothed in a garment dipped in blood. And his armies in heaven followed him 
upon white horses, clothed in fine linen white and clean. And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that sat upon the horse, and against 
his army (Rev. 19:11, 13-14, 19); </p>
<p>     "he that sat upon the white horse" denotes the Lord's Word, or the Lord as to the Word (n. 2760-2762); "his armies in heaven that followed him" denote the truths 
therefrom, consequently those in heaven who are in truths; the "beast" denotes the evils of the love of self; the "kings of the earth and their armies" denote falsities. The combats of falsity with 
truth are what are here described. [5] In David: </p>
<p>     By the word of Jehovah were the heavens made, and all the army of them by the breath of His mouth (Ps. 33:6); </p>
<p>the "army of them," or of the heavens, 
denotes truths. Because truths are signified by an "army," the sons of the kingdom and the angels, from the truths in which they are, are called the "army of the heavens" as in Luke: </p>
<p>     Suddenly 
there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army praising God (Luke 2:13). In David: </p>
<p>     Bless Jehovah, all ye His armies, ye ministers of His that do His will (Ps. 103:21). Praise 
ye him all His angels; praise ye Him all His army (Ps. 148:2). In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Lift up your eyes on high, and see who hath created these; He that bringeth out their army by number. He calleth them all 
by name; of the multitude of the powerful and of the mighty not a man is lacking (Isa. 40:26).      I have made the earth and created man upon it; I, My hands have stretched out the heavens, and all 
their army have I commanded (Isa. 45:12); </p>
<p>where the "army of the heavens" denotes truths, thus the angels, because they are in truths, as has been shown. [6] In the first book of Kings: </p>
<p>     I saw 
Jehovah sitting on His throne, and all the army of the heavens standing by Him on His right hand and on His left (1 Kings 22:19). In Joel: </p>
<p>     Jehovah uttereth His voice before His army; for His 
camp is very great; for he is strong that doeth His word (Joel 2:11). In Zechariah: </p>
<p>     I will encamp about My house against the army that passeth through and returneth, and no exactor shall pass 
through them any more. Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; make a loud noise, O daughter of Jerusalem; behold thy King cometh unto thee (Zech. 9:8-9); </p>
<p>where the coming of the Lord is treated of; his 
"army" denotes truths Divine. It is from this and also because the Lord alone fights for man against the hells which are in the continual effort to assault him, that in the Word the Lord is so often 
called "Jehovah Zebaoth," "God Zebaoth," the "Lord Zebaoth," that is, "of armies" as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The voice of a tumult of the kingdoms of the nations gathered together; Jehovah Zebaoth mustereth 
the army for the battle (Isa. 13:4); </p>
<p>"the kingdoms of the nations" denote falsities from evils; "mustering the army for the battle" denotes fighting for man. [7] Inasmuch as the twelve tribes of Israel 
represented the Lord's heavenly kingdom, and "tribes" and likewise "twelve" signified all things of faith in one complex, that is, all truths of the kingdom (n. 577, 2089, 2129, 2130, 3272), therefore 
also they were called the "armies of Jehovah;" as in Exodus 7:4; 12:17, 41, 51; and it was commanded that they should be brought out of Egypt "according to their armies" (Exod. 6:26); and should 
mete out the camp "according to their armies" (Num. 1:52); and should be distributed into their "armies" (Num. 2). [8] That by "armies" are signified truths, is evident also in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Persia 
and Lud and Put were in thine army, thy men of war; they hanged the shield and the helmet in thee, they set forth thine honor; the sons of Arvad and thine army were upon thy walls round about, and the 
Gammadim were in thy towers (Ezek. 27:10-11); </p>
<p>speaking of Tyre, by which are signified the interior knowledges of good and truth, and thus those who are therein (n. 1201); "army" denotes the truths 
themselves; that "Lud and Put" are also those who are in knowledges may be seen above (n. 1163, 1164, 1166, 1195, 1231); "shield and helmet" are such things as pertain to spiritual combat or war. [9] 
That in the opposite sense "armies" signify falsities, is manifest in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     It shall come to pass in that day that Jehovah shall visit upon the army of the height in the height, and upon the 
kings of the earth upon the earth (Isa. 24:21); </p>
<p>where the " armies of the height" denote falsities from the love of self. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     I will bring thee back, and put hooks in thy jaws, and I will 
bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them completely clad, a great company with buckler and shield, all of them handling swords. Thou shalt come from thy place out of the 
sides to the north, thou and many peoples with thee, all of them riding on horses, a great company and a mighty army (Ezek. 38:4, 15); </p>
<p>speaking of Gog, by whom is signified external worship separate 
from internal, thus become idolatrous (n. 1151); his "army" denotes falsities. [10] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     I will send against Babylon him that bendeth, bending his bow, and lifting up himself in his 
coat of mail; spare ye not her young men, give to the curse all her army (Jer. 51:2-3); </p>
<p>"Babylon" denotes worship the externals of which appear holy, but the interiors are profane (n. 1182, 1283, 1295, 
1304, 1306-1308, 1321, 1322, 1326); "her army" is the falsities of such profane interiors, as in like manner the "army of Babylon" in other passages (as Jer. 32:2; 34:1, 21; 39:1). In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>   
  Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword. For I will put the terror of Me in the land of the living (Ezek. 32:31-32); </p>
<p>speaking 
of Egypt, by which are signified those who pervert truths by reasonings from memory-knowledges (n. 1164, 1165); "his army," or the army of Pharaoh, denotes falsities therefrom; the like is also signified 
by the "army of Pharaoh" in other passages (as Jer. 37:5, 7, 11; 46:2; Ezek. 17:17). In Luke: </p>
<p>     When ye see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that her desolation is at hand (Luke 
21:20); </p>
<p>where the consummation of the age is treated of, or the last time of the church, when there is no longer any faith. That by "Jerusalem" is signified the church, see above (n. 2117), which is 
"compassed with armies" when it is beset by falsities. [11] Hence it is evident that by the "armies of the heavens" which the Jews and idolaters adored, in the internal sense were signified falsities, 
concerning which in the second book of Kings: </p>
<p>     They forsook all the commandments of their God, and made them a molten image, even two calves, and made a grove, and bowed themselves down to all 
the army of the heavens (2 Kings 17:16). This is said of the Israelites; and in another place it is written concerning Manasseh that: </p>
<p>     He built altars for all the army of the heavens (2 Kings 21:5); </p>
<p>and 
again that: </p>
<p>     Josiah the king brought forth out of the temple all the vessels made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the army of the heavens (2 Kings 23:4); </p>
<p>and in Jeremiah, that: </p>
<p> 
    They should bring out the bones of the princes, of the priests, and of the prophets, and should spread them before the sun and the moon, and all the army of the heavens, which they have loved, 
and which they have served, and after which they have walked (Jer. 8:1-2).      The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah shall be unclean like Tophet, as to all the houses upon 
whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the army of the heavens, and have poured out drink-offerings unto other gods (Jer. 19:13). And in Zephaniah: </p>
<p>     I will stretch out Mine hand against them 
that worship the army of the heavens upon the roofs (Zeph. 1:4-5); </p>
<p>for it is principally the stars that are called the "army of the heavens;" and that by the "stars" are signified truths, and in 
the opposite sense falsities, may be seen above (n. 1128, 1808). * The Latin has "the south." </p>

'And Ahuzzath his companion, and Phicol the commander of his army' means the first and foremost features of their doctrine of faith. This is clear from the representation of 'Abimelech' as the doctrine 
of faith which has regard to rational concepts. Consequently 'his companion and the commander of his army' means those first and foremost things, indeed the first and foremost things of their doctrine; 
for 'a commander' like a prince means things that are first and foremost, <a href="1482.htm">1482</a>, <a href="2089.htm">2089</a>, and 'an army' means matters of doctrine themselves. The reason why 'an army' means matters of doctrine which 
are expressions of truth, that is, which are lower truths, is that by 'warfare' in the Word and by 'war' are meant those things that have to do with spiritual war and warfare, <a href="1664.htm">1664</a>, <a href="1788.htm">1788</a>, <a href="2686.htm">2686</a>. The same 
are also meant by weapons - by spears, shields, bows, arrows, swords, and so on, as has been shown in various places. And since they are truths or matters of doctrine through which spiritual conflicts 
are fought, armies therefore mean those truths or matters of doctrine, and also in the contrary sense falsities or heretical ideas. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It may be seen from many places that by 'armies' or 'hosts' 
in the Word are meant truths or falsities, as in Daniel, </p>
<blockquote>
The one [little] horn of the he-goat<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> grew exceedingly towards the south, and towards the east, and towards the glorious [land]. And it grew 
even towards the host of heaven, and cast down to earth some of the host, and of the stars, and trampled on them. It drew itself up even towards the pence of the host. His host was set over the continual 
[burnt offering] on account of the transgression, and it cast down truth to the earth. I heard a holy one speaking. He said, For how long is this vision, the continual burnt offering, and the 
desolating transgression, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden down? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%208:9-13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 8:9-13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The horn that grew towards the south, the east, and the glorious [land]' is the power of falsity 
that springs from evil, <a href="2832.htm">2832</a>, 'the host of heaven' truths, 'the prince of the host' the Lord as regards Divine Truth. And since in the good sense 'an army' or 'a host' is truth it is said that the horn 
cast down to earth some of the host, and then that it cast down truth to the earth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The king of the north will raise a multitude greater than the former, and at the end 
of the period of years he wit surely come with a great army and with many riches. Then he will stir up his power and his heart against the king of the south with a great army. And the king of the south 
will engage in war with an exceedingly great and mighty army, but he will not stand. For even those who eat his food will break him, and his army will overflow, and many will fall down slain. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%2011:13,%2025,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 11:13, 25, 26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The whole of that chapter refers to war between the king of the north and the king of the south. 'The king of the north' is used to mean falsities as also is 'his army', while 'the 
king of the south and his army' is used to mean truths. It is prophecy concerning the vastation of the Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In John, </p>
<blockquote>
I saw heaven standing open, and behold, a white horse! and He who sat 
on it was called faithful and true. He was clothed in a garment dyed in blood, and His armies in heaven were following Him on white horses and were clothed in linen, white and clean. I saw the beast and 
the kings of the earth and their armies gathered to make war with Him who was sitting on the horse and with His army. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2019:11,%2013,%2014,%2019&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 19:11, 13, 14, 19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'He who sat on the white horse' stands for the Word 
of the Lord, or the Lord as regards the Word, <a href="2760.htm">2760</a>-<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>. 'His armies which in heaven were following Him' stands for truths from the Word and so for those in heaven who possess truths. 'The beast' stands 
for the evils that belong to self-love, 'the kings of the earth and their armies' for falsities. Conflicts between falsity and truth are what are described here. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In David, </p>
<blockquote>
By the word of 
Jehovah were the heavens made, and their host by the spirit of His mouth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2033:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 33:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Their host' or the host of heaven stands for truths. Since 'an army' means truths, the children of the kingdom, 
and angels, by virtue of the truths which they possess, are called the host of heaven, as in Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
Suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%202:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 2:13</a>.

<p>In 
David, </p>
<blockquote>
Bless Jehovah, all His hosts, His ministers doing His will. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20103:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 103:21</a>.

<p>In the same author, </p>

<p>In Isaiah, </p>
<p>Lift 
up your eyes on high and see; who created these? He who brings out their host by number; He calls them all by name. From the multitude of the powerful and of the mighty not a man will be missing. Isa. 
40:26. </p>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
It was I that made the earth and created man on it. It was I - My hands - that stretched out the heavens; and I commanded all their host. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2045:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 45:12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the host 
of the heavens' stands for truths, and so for angels since angels, as has been stated, are in possession of truths. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In the first Book of Kings, </p>
<p>I saw Jehovah sitting on His throne, and the 
entire host of heaven standing beside Him, on His right hand and on His left. <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 22:19 </p>
<p>In Joel, </p>
<p>Jehovah gave voice before His army, for His camp is exceedingly great; for that which executes 
His word is uncountable. Joel 2:11. </p>
<p>In Zechariah, </p>
<p>I will pitch by My house a camp composed of an army passing through and resuming, so that the oppressor passes over them no more. Exult greatly, 
O daughter of Zion! Make a noise, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your King comes to you. Zech. 9:8, <a href="9.htm">9</a>. </p>
<p>This refers to the Coming of the Lord. 'His army' stands for Divine truths For this reason, 
and also because the Lord alone fights on man's behalf against hells that are constantly endeavouring to attack, the Lord is called many times in the Word Jehovah Zebaoth, God Zebaoth, the Lord Zebaoth 
- that is, Jehovah, God, or Lord of Hosts - as in Isaiah, </p>
<p>The noise of a tumult of the kingdoms of the nations gathered together! Jehovah Zebaoth is leading an army of war Isa 13:4. </p>
<p>'The 
kingdoms of the nations' stands for falsities that spring from evils, 'leading an army of war' for fighting on man's behalf. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 Because the twelve tribes of Israel represented the Lord's heavenly 
kingdom, and 'tribes' as well as 'twelve' meant all things of faith in their entirety, that is, all the truths of the kingdom, <a href="577.htm">577</a>, <a href="2089.htm">2089</a>, <a href="2129.htm">2129</a>, <a href="2130.htm">2130</a>, <a href="3272.htm">3272</a>, they were also called Jehovah's hosts, as in 
Exod. 7:4; 12:17, <a href="41.htm">41</a>, <a href="51.htm">51</a>. And commands were given to bring them out of Egypt according to their hosts, Exod. 6:26, to encamp according to their hosts, Num. 1:52, and to divide them into hosts, Num. 2:1- 
end. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 That truths are meant by 'armies' is also clear in Ezekiel, </p>
<p>Persia and Lud and Put were in your army, as your men of war; they hung the shield and helmet in you, they gave you your 
reputation. The sons of Arvad, and your army, were on your walls round about, and the Gammadim were in your towers. Ezek. 27:10, <a href="11.htm">11</a>. </p>
<p>This refers to Tyre which means interior cognitions of good and 
truth, and so those who possess them, <a href="1201.htm">1201</a>, 'army' standing for truths themselves 'Lud' and 'Put' too mean those who possess cognitions, see <a href="1163.htm">1163</a>, <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1166.htm">1166</a>, <a href="1195.htm">1195</a>, <a href="1231.htm">1231</a>. 'The shield and helmet' describes 
such things as belong to spiritual conflict. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 As regards 'an army' or 'a host' in the contrary sense meaning falsities, this is evident in Isaiah, </p>
<p>It will be on that day, that Jehovah will 
visit the host of the height on high, and the kings of the earth on the earth. Isa. 24:21. </p>
<p>Here 'the host of the height' stands for falsities that result from self-love. In Ezekiel, </p>
<p>I will bring 
you back and put hooks in your jaws, and I will bring you forth, and all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed perfectly, a great company with shield and buckler, all of them wielding 
swords. You will come from your place, from the uttermost parts of the north, you and many peoples with you, all of them riding horses, a great company, a great army. Ezek. 38:4, <a href="15.htm">15</a>. </p>
<p>This refers 
to Gog, who means external worship separated from internal and so made idolatrous, <a href="1151.htm">1151</a>. 'His army' stands for falsities. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[10]</b>
 In Jeremiah, </p>
<p>I will send against Babel the archer, him who arches his 
bow and draws himself up in his breastplate. Do not spare the young men; utterly destroy all its host. Jer. 51:2, <a href="3.htm">3</a>. </p>
<p>'Babel' stands for worship whose external features appear holy but whose interiors 
are profane, <a href="1182.htm">1182</a>, <a href="1283.htm">1283</a>, <a href="1295.htm">1295</a>, <a href="1304.htm">1304</a>, <a href="1306.htm">1306</a>-<a href="1308.htm">1308</a>, <a href="1321.htm">1321</a>, <a href="1322.htm">1322</a>, <a href="1326.htm">1326</a>. 'Its host' means the falsities that go with such as these, and the army of Babel in other places has the same meaning as in Jer. 
34:1, <a href="21.htm">21</a>; 32:2; 39:1. In Ezekiel, </p>
<p>Pharaoh will see them and will comfort himself over all his multitude, Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword; for I will put My terror in the land of the living. 
Ezek. 32:31, <a href="32.htm">32</a>. </p>
<p>This refers to Egypt, which means those who by means of reasonings based on facts pervert truths, <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>. 'His army', that is, Pharaoh's, stands for derivative falsities, 
as also does 'Pharaoh's army' in other places, as in Jer. 37:5, <a href="7.htm">7</a>, <a href="11.htm">11</a>; 46:2; Ezek. 17:17. In Luke, </p>
<p>When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its devastation is near. Luke 21:20. </p>
<p>This 
refers to the close of the age or final period of the Church when faith does not exist any longer. 'Jerusalem' - which means the Church, see <a href="2117.htm">2117</a> - is 'surrounded by armies' when beset by falsities. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[11]</b>
From these quotations it is clear that 'the hosts of heaven', which Jews and Israelite idolaters worshipped, in the internal sense meant falsities. The second Book of Kings says of them, </p>
<p>They 
forsook all the commandments of their God and made for themselves a molten image of two calves, and made a grove, and bowed down to all the host of heaven. <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 17:16. </p>
<p>This refers to 
the Israelites. And elsewhere it is said of Manasseh that he built altars for all the host of heaven, <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 21:5, and that King Josiah brought out of the temple all the vessels made for Baal, and for 
the grove, and for all the host of heaven, <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 23:4. And in Jeremiah it is said that they were to spread the bones of the princes, of the priests, and of the prophets before the sun, the moon, and 
all the host of heaven, which they had loved and had served and had gone after, Jer. 8:1, <a href="2.htm">2</a>. And elsewhere, </p>
<p>The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the king of Judah will be defiled, like the 
place of Topheth - all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense to all the host of heaven and have poured out drink offerings to other gods. Jer. 19:13. </p>
<p>And in Zephaniah, </p>
<p>I will stretch 
out My hand against those worshipping on their roofs the host of heaven. Zeph. 1:5. </p>
<p>It is the stars to which the expression 'the host of heaven' refers primarily, and by 'the stars' is meant truths,

n. 1163, 1164, 1166, 1195, 1231; `scutum et galea' sunt talia quae sunt {9}pugnae seu belli spiritualis. [9] Quod `exercitus' in opposito sensu sint falsa, patet apud Esaiam,           Erit in die 
illo, visitabit Jehovah super exercitum      altitudinis in altitudine, et super reges terrae super terra,      xxiv 21; </p>
<p>ubi `exercitus altitudinis' pro falsis ex amore sui: apud Ezechielem,  
         Reducam te, et dabo hamos in maxillis tuis, et educam te,      et omnem exercitum tuum, equos et equites, indutos perfecte      omnes illos, coetum magnum scuto et clypeo, prehendentes    
  gladios omnes; venies e loco tuo, e lateribus septentrionis,      tu et populi multi tecum, equitantes equis omnes, coetus      magnus, {10}exercitus magnus, xxxviii 4, 15; </p>
<p>ubi de Gogo, per quem 
significatur cultus externus separatus ab interno, ita factus idololatricus, n. 1151, `exercitus illius' pro falsis: [10] apud Jeremiam, 		Mittam contra Babelem...qui tendit, tendens arcum suum, et 	{11}efferens 
se lorica sua, ne parcite juvenibus, devotioni date 	omnem exercitum ejus, ii 2, 3; </p>
<p>`Babel' pro cultu cujus externa apparent sancta, sed interiora sunt profana, n. 1182, 1283, 1295, 
1304, 1306-1308, 1321, 1322, 1326; `exercitus ejus' sunt talium falsa, similiter alibi exercitus Babelis, ut Jer. (x)xxxiv 1, 21; xxxii 2; xxxix 1: apud Ezechielem,           Illos videbit Pharaoh, et 
consolabitur se super omni      multitudine sua, confossi gladio, Pharaoh et omnis exercitus      ejus, quia dabo terrorem Mei in terra viventium, xxxii 31, 32; </p>
<p>ubi de Aegypto, per quam significantur 
illi qui per ratiocinia ex scientificis pervertunt vera, n.  1164, 1165, `exercitus (c)ejus' seu Pharaonis pro falsis inde; similiter etiam alibi `exercitus Pharaonis,' ut Jer. xxxvii 5, 7, 11; xlvi 
2; Ezech. xvii 17: apud Lucam,           Quando videritis circumdatam ab exercitibus Hierosolymam,      tunc scite quod prope sit devastatio, xxi 20; </p>
<p>ubi de consummatione saeculi, seu de ultimo 
tempore Ecclesiae cum nulla amplius fides; quod per `Hierosolymam' significetur Ecclesia, videatur n. 2117, quae `circumdatur exercitibus' quando obsidetur a falsis. [11] Inde constat quod per `exercitus 
caelorum,' quos Judaei et Israelitae idololatrae adoraverunt, in sensu interno significata sint falsa, de quibus in Libro Secundo Regum,           Deseruerunt omnia praecepta Dei sui, et fecerant 
sibi      fusile, duos vitulos, et fecerunt lucum, et incurvaverunt se      omni exercitui caelorum, xvii 16; </p>
<p>ubi de Israelitis; et alibi ubi de Menasse,           Quod aedificaverit altaria omni 
exercitui caelorum, xxi 5: </p>
<p>et quod           Joshiah rex eduxerit e templo omnia vasa facta baali, et      luco, et omni exercitui caelorum, xxiii 4: </p>
<p>et apud Jeremiam,           Quod ossa principum, 
sacerdotum, et prophetarum      expanderent soli, lunae, et omni exercitui caelorum, quae      amaverant, et quibus serviverant, et post quae iverant, viii 2: </p>
<p>et alibi,           Erunt domus 
Hierosolymae et domus regis Jehudae, sicut      locus Tophet, immundae, quoad omnes {12}domus, super quarum      tectis suffiverunt omni exercitui caelorum, et libando      libaverunt diis aliis, 
xix 13: </p>
<p>et apud Zephaniam,           Extendam manum Meam contra adorantes super tectis      exercitui caelorum, i 5; </p>
<p>sunt enim stellae quae imprimis vocantur `exercitus caelorum,' {13}at quod per 
`stellas' significentur vera, tum in opposito sensu falsa, videatur n. 1128, 1808. @1 i illius$  @2 i id$  @3 i illorum$  @4 pro$  @5 genuino$  @6 vero$  @7 i qui in caelo$  @8 nempe ex Divinis
