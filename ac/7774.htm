<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7774.</strong>出埃及记11:4-8.摩西说，耶和华这样说，约到半夜，我必出去，进入埃及中间。凡在埃及地头生的，从坐宝座的法老的长子，直到磨坊后的婢女的长子，以及一切头生的牲畜，都必死。埃及全地必有大哀号，从前没有这样的，后来也必不再有这样的。至于所有以色列人，连狗也不向人，甚至牲畜摇舌，好叫你们知道耶和华是将埃及人和以色列分别出来。你这一切臣仆都要下到我这里，向我俯伏下拜说，求你和所有在你脚下的百姓，都出去；然后我要出去。于是，摩西气忿忿地从法老面前出去。<br />“摩西说，耶和华这样说”表指示。“约到半夜”表当完全荒凉时。“我必出去，进入埃及中间”表那时神性处处的出现。“凡在埃及地头生的都必死”表那时与仁分离之信的诅咒。“从坐宝座的法老的长子”表占据首位的信之被歪曲的真理。“直到磨坊后的婢女的长子”表占据末位的信之被歪曲的真理。“以及一切头生的牲畜”表信之被玷污的良善。“埃及全地必有大哀号”表深深的悲痛。“从前没有这样的，后来也必不再有这样的”表这状态具有这样的性质，不可能有像它这样的。“至于所有以色列人，连狗也不摇舌”表在那些属于属灵教会的人当中不会有一丝诅咒或悲痛的痕迹。“向人，甚至牲畜”表真理方面没有，良善方面也没有。“好叫你们知道耶和华是将埃及人和以色列分别出来”表好让人人皆知那些沉浸于虚假的人与那些处于良善的人有什么不同。“你这一切臣仆都要下到我这里”表那些处于从属地位的人。“向我俯伏下拜”表由惧怕所生的对神之真理的尊重。“说，求你和所有在你脚下的百姓，都出去”表祈求让他们离开那些处于从神来的真理之人，从最高的到最低的。“然后我要出去”表神之真理要离开。“于是，摩西气忿忿地从法老面前出去”表神之真理的出现与那些即将受到诅咒的人猛烈断绝关系。</p>

Verses 4-8. And Moses said, Thus said Jehovah, About midnight I will go out into the midst of Egypt. And every firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh about to sit upon 
his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the millstones; and every firstborn of beast. And there shall be a great cry in the whole land of Egypt, such as there hath been 
none like it, nor shall be like it anymore. And to all the sons of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, from man and even to beast; that ye may know that Jehovah doth separate between the Egyptians 
and Israel. And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves to me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that is at thy feet; and thereafter I will go out. And he went 
out from Pharaoh in the wrath of anger. "And Moses said, Thus said Jehovah," signifies instruction; "About midnight," signifies when the devastation is total; "I will go out into the midst of Egypt," 
signifies the presence of the Divine then everywhere; "and every firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die," signifies the damnation then of faith separate from charity; "from the firstborn of Pharaoh 
about to sit upon his throne," signifies the falsified truths of faith which are in the first place; "even to the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the millstones," signifies the falsified 
truths of faith which are in the last place; "and every first-born of beast" signifies the adulterated goods of faith; "and there shall be a great cry in the whole land of Egypt," signifies interior lamentation; 
"such as there hath been none like it, nor shall be like it anymore" signifies that the state was such that there could not be any like it; "and to all the sons of Israel shall not a dog move 
his tongue," signifies that among those who were of the spiritual church there should not be the least of damnation and lamentation; "from man and even to beast," signifies neither as to truth nor 
as to good; "that ye may know that Jehovah doth separate between the Egyptians and Israel," signifies that it may be known what is the nature of the difference between those who are in evil and those 
who are in good; "and all these thy servants shall come down unto me," signifies those who are subordinate; "and bow down themselves to me," signifies respect from fear on account of truth Divine; "saying, 
Get thee out, and all the people that is at thy feet," signifies supplication that they may depart from those who are in truth from the Divine, from the highest to the lowest; "and thereafter I 
will go out," signifies that truth Divine will depart; "and he went out from before Pharaoh in the wrath of anger," signifies the rending asunder of the presence of truth Divine from those who are about 
to be damned. </p>

Verses 4-8 And Moses said, Thus said Jehovah, About midnight I will go out into the midst of Egypt; and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt will die, from Pharaoh's firstborn who is to sit on his 
throne, even to the firstborn of the servant-girl who is behind the mill, and all the firstborn of the beasts. And there will be a great cry in the whole land of Egypt, the like of which has never been, 
and the like of which will not be again. And against all the children of Israel not a dog will move its tongue, against man (vir) and even against beast, so that you may know that Jehovah makes a distinction 
between the Egyptians and Israel. And all these your servants will come down to me, and bow down to me, saying, Go out, your and all the people at your feet!<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> And after that I will go out. 
And he went out from Pharaoh in wrath and anger.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> </p>
<p>'And Moses said, Thus said Jehovah' means instruction. 'About midnight' means when vastation is completed. 'I will go out into the midst of Egypt' 
means the presence of the Divine everywhere then. 'And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt will die' means the damnation of faith separated from charity then. 'From Pharaoh's firstborn who is to sit 
on his throne' means falsified truths of faith that occupy the first place. 'Even to the firstborn of the servant-girl who is behind the mill' means falsified truths of faith that occupy the very last 
place. 'And all the firstborn of the beasts' means adulterated forms of the good of faith. 'And there will be a great cry in the whole land of Egypt' means deep grief. 'The like of which has never 
been, and the like of which will not be again' means that the nature of the state was such that there could be none similar to it. 'And against all the children of Israel not a dog will move its tongue' 
means that with those belonging to the spiritual Church there would not be the smallest trace of damnation or grief. 'Against man and even against beast' means neither in respect of truth nor of good. 
'So that you may know that Jehovah makes a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel' means so that the nature of the difference between those immersed in evil and those governed by good may be 
known. 'And all these your servants will come down to me' means those who are subordinate. 'And bow down to me' means respect for God's truth generated by fear. 'Saying, Go out, you, and all the people 
at your feet!' means pleading to let them depart from those guided by the truth from God, highest to lowest. 'And after that I will go out' means that God's truth will depart. 'And he went out from 
Pharaoh in wrath and anger' means a violent breaking off of the presence of God's truth from those who are to be damned.

Vers. 4-8.  Et dixit Moscheh, Ita dixit Jehovah, Circa medium noctis Ego exibo in medium Aegypti.  Et morietur omnis primogenitus in terra Aegypti, a primogenito Pharaonis sessuro super throno illius, 
usque ad primogenitum ancillae quae post molas; et omne primogenitum bestiae.  Et erit clamor magnus in tota terra Aegypti, qui sicut ille non fuerat, et sicut ille non addetur.  Et omnibus filiis 
Israelis non movebit canis linguam suam, ad a viro et usque ad bestiam; propterea ut sciatis quod discernat Jehovah inter Aegyptios et inter Israelem.  Et descendent omnes servi tui illi ad me, et incurvabunt 
se mihi, dicendo, Exi tu et omnis populus qui in pedibus tuis, et post ita exibo; et exivit a cum Pharaone in excandescentia irae.  `Et dixit Moscheh, Ita dixit Jehovah' significat instructionem: 
`Circa medium noctis' significat cum devastatio totalis: `Ego exibo in medium Aegypti' significat praesentiam Divini ubivis tunc: `et morietur omnis primogenitus in terra Aegypti' significat damnationem 
fidei separatae a charitate tunc: `a primogenito Pharaonis sessuro super throno illius' significat vera falsificata fidei quae primo loco: `usque ad primogenitum ancillae quae post molas' significat 
vera falsificata fidei quae postremo loco: `et omne primogenitum bestiae' significat fidei bona adulterata: `et erit clamor magnus in tota terra Aegypti' significat lamentationem interiorem: `qui 
sicut ille non fuerat, et sicut ille non addetur' significat quod talis status esset ut ei non similis dari' posset: `et omnibus filiis Israelis non movebit canis linguam suam' significat quod apud 
illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali non minimum damnationis et lamentationis esset: `ad a viro et usque ad bestiam' significat non quoad verum nec quoad bonum: `propterea ut sciatis quod discernat Jehovah 
inter Aegyptios et inter Israelem' significat ut notum sit quale discrimen fit inter illos qui in malo et qui in bono: `et descendent omnes servi tui illi ad me' significat illos qui subordinati: `et 
incurvabunt se mihi' significat respectum ex timore pro vero Divino: `dicendo, Exi tu et omnis populus qui in pedibus tuis' significat supplicationem ut discedant ab illis qui in vero a Divino sunt, 
a summo ad imum: `et post ita exibo' significat quod verum Divinum discedet: `et exivit a cum Pharaone in excandescentia irae' significat praesentiae veri Divini divulsionem a damnandis. </p>
