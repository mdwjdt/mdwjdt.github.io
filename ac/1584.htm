<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1584节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1584.</strong>“罗得举目”表外在人从内在人接受光明。这从“举目”的含义清楚可知，“举目”就是观看，其内义是指觉察。此处“举目”表接受光明，因为它论及罗得，或外在人；当与内在人结合时，通过觉察外在人的性质，即觉察其美丽的性质，外在人从内在人接受光明，并拥有此处所论述的神性视觉。毋庸置疑，当主还是个孩子时，就其外在人而言，祂经常拥有这种神性视觉，因为唯独主要将外在人与内在人结合起来。外在人是祂的人性本质，而内在人则是祂的神性本质。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1584.</strong> Lot raised his eyes means that his outer self was enlightened by his inner self. This can be seen from the meaning of raising one's eyes as seeing and in an inner sense as perceiving. Here it means being enlightened, because it is said of Lot, or the outer self. When the outer self perceives what its own quality is when united with the inner self 钬?in other words, when it is at its most beautiful 钬?it is being enlightened by the inner self. It is experiencing divine vision, which is the topic of discussion here. No one can doubt that when the Lord was young his outer self often enjoyed this divine power of sight, because he alone was to unite his outer self with his inner. (His outer self was his human quality, but his inner self was his divine quality.) </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1584</b></p><p><b>1584.</b>
Lot lifted up his eyes. That this signifies that the external man was illuminated by the internal, is evident from the signification of "lifting up the eyes," as being to see, and, in the internal sense, 
to perceive, here, to be illuminated, because it is predicated of Lot, or the external man; for this, when it perceives what the external man is when conjoined with the internal, or what it is in 
its beauty, is then illuminated by the internal man, and is then in the Divine vision here treated of. Nor can it be doubted that the Lord when a child was as to His external man frequently in such Divine 
sight, because He alone was to conjoin the external man with the internal. The external man was His Human Essence; the internal man was the Divine Essence. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1584</b></p><p><b>1584.</b>
That 'Lot lifted up his eyes' means that the external man received light from the internal is clear from the meaning of 'lifting up the eyes', which is seeing, in the internal sense, perceiving. Here 
'lifting up the eyes' means receiving light, for this expression is used in reference to Lot, or the external man; and by perceiving the nature of the External Man when joined to the Internal Man, that 
is, the nature of its beauty, the external man receives light from the internal and possesses the Divine vision that is the subject here. Nor can there be any doubt that when He was a boy, the Lord 
as regards His external Man frequently had such Divine vision, for He alone was to join the external Man to the internal Man. The External Man was His Human Essence, while the Internal Man was His Divine Essence. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1584</b>
</p><b>1584.</b>
Quod 'sustulit Lot oculos suos' significet quod externus homo illuminatus ab interno, constat a significatione 'tollere oculos,' quod est videre, in sensu interno percipere, hic illuminari quia praedicatur 
de 'Loto' seu externo homine, qui cum percipit qualis Externus Homo est cum conjunctus Interno seu qualis in sua pulchritudine, tunc est illuminatus ab Interno, estque tunc in visione Divina, 
de qua hic agitur; nec dubitari potest quin Dominus cum puer, quoad externum hominem multoties in tali Divino visu fuerit, quia Ipse solus conjungeret Externum Hominem Interno; Externus Homo fuit Humana 
Ipsius Essentia, Internus autem Divina. </p>
