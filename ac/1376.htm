<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">关于来世的位置、地方、距离和时间（续）</h4><br />1376.我经常与灵人们谈论他们当中地方和距离的概念。它们并非真实事物，只是一种表象，无非是其思维和情感的状态。这些状态以地方和距离的形式发生变化，并同样以这种方式呈现在灵人界。天堂天使的情况不是这样，他们没有地方或时间的概念，只有状态的概念。但是，粘附于肉体和世俗概念的灵人们并不理解这一点，他们以为实情和他们所看到的一模一样。这类灵人很难被引导相信他们并非活在肉身，并拒绝相信他们是灵人。因此，他们几乎无法被引导相信这种事有表象或幻觉的可能。因渴望活在幻觉中，他们阻止自己去认识和承认与幻觉相去甚远的真理和良善。地方的变化只是一种表象，也是一种感官幻觉，这一事实已再三向他们显明。在来世，地方的变化分为两种：一种是前面提到的，一切灵人和天使在大人（Grand Man）中一直保持在自己的位置上，这是一种表象；另一种是灵人们出现在一个地方，而事实上，他们并不在那里，这是一种幻觉。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1376.</strong> Location and Place in the Other Life; Distance and Time There as Well (Continued)<br />I have often talked with spirits about the idea they have of place and distance. "They're not real," I tell them, "but only look as though they were. On the contrary, space and distance are just changes in the state of your thoughts and feelings, which make themselves visible this way in the world of spirits. There is no such appearance in heaven, among angels, since they have no concept of space and time, only of state."<br />Spirits who have physical and earthly ideas clinging to them do not grasp this, though. They believe that the situation really is exactly as they see it. It is almost impossible to lead spirits like this to believe anything but that they are still living in their bodies. They refuse to be convinced that they are spirits. So they are almost completely unwilling to hear that any kind of appearance or fallacy exists, preferring to live in their illusions. In this way they shut themselves off from understanding and acknowledging anything true or good that is too far removed from their misconceptions.<br />They have been shown over and over that a change of location is nothing more than a visible manifestation or else a trick of the senses. Changes of location in the other world are of two kinds, you see. One, described earlier [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1376/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1276" target=_top>1276</a>], involves the fact that all spirits and angels keep their same place in the universal human at all times, which is a visible manifestation. The other involves the fact that spirits can appear in a place when they are not really there, which is an illusion. </p>

CONTINUATION CONCERNING SITUATION AND PLACE,AND ALSO CONCERNING DISTANCE AND TIME, IN THE OTHER LIFE. I have frequently conversed with spirits concerning the idea of place and of distance among them-that 
it is not anything real, but appears as if it were, being nothing else than their states of thought and of affection, which are thus varied, and are in this manner presented to view in the world 
of spirits; but not so much so in heaven among the angels, since these are not in the idea of place and time, but in that of states. But the spirits to whom bodily and earthly ideas adhere, do not apprehend 
this, for they suppose that the case is exactly as they see it to be. Such spirits can hardly be brought to believe otherwise than that they are living in the body, and are not willing to be persuaded 
that they are spirits; and thus scarcely that there is any appearance, or any fallacy, in relation to the matter, for they desire to live in fallacies. Thus do they preclude themselves from the 
apprehension and acknowledgment of truths and goods, which are as far as possible from fallacies. It has been shown them many times that change of place is nothing but an appearance, and also a fallacy 
of sense. For there are two kinds of mutation of place in the other life; one is that which has been spoken of before, when it is said that all spirits and angels in the Grand Man constantly keep 
their own situation therein; which is an appearance. The other is that spirits appear in a place when in fact they are not there, which is a fallacy. </p>

POSITION AND PLACE, AND ALSO DISTANCE AND TIME IN THE NEXT LIFE - continued </p>
<p>I have spoken frequently to spirits about the idea that place and distance with them are not anything real but only appear 
to be so, being nothing other than their states of thought and affection, which vary in the way place and distance do and which visually present themselves as such in the world of spirits. This is 
not so much the case with angels in heaven. They have no idea of place or of time, but only of states. Spirits however who cling to bodily and earthly ideas do not comprehend this because they imagine 
that everything really is exactly as they behold it. Such spirits can scarcely be led to believe otherwise than that they are living in the body, and refuse to be convinced that they are spirits. Thus 
they can scarcely be led to believe that any appearances or illusions are possible, desiring to live in illusions, and so they shut themselves off from grasping and acknowledging truths and goods, which 
are very far from being illusions. They have been shown time and again that change of place is merely an appearance, and also an illusion of the senses. In fact there are in the next life two kinds 
of changes of place. The first is that mentioned already, in which every spirit and angel in the Grand Man remains all the time in his own position; this is an appearance. The second is that in which 
spirits appear in a place when in fact they are not there at all; this is an illusion. </p>

Continuatio de Situ et Loco, ut et de Distantia et Tempore, in altera vita </p>
<p>LOCUTUS saepe cum spiritibus de idea loci et distantiae apud eos quod non sit reale quoddam sed apparens sicut foret, cum 
tamen non aliud sint quam status eorum cogitationis et affectionis qui sic variantur, ac sistuntur ita videndi in mundo spirituum; non ita in caelo apud angelos, cum non in idea loci et temporis sunt 
sed in idea statuum.  Sed spiritus quibus corporeae et terrestres ideae adhaerent, id non capiunt, putantes ita prorsus esse sicut vident; tales vix possunt adduci aliter credere quam quod in corpore 
vivant, et quod spiritus sint, nolunt persuaderi, ita vix quod aliqua apparentia detur, nec quod aliqua fallacia, cupientes in fallaciis vivere; ita praecludunt sibi ad capiendum et agnoscendum vera 
et bona, quae longissime a fallaciis distant.  Ostensum iis pluries quod mutatio loci non sit nisi apparentia, ut et fallacia sensus: sunt enim binae species mutationum loci in altera vita, una est de 
qua prius, quod omnes spiritus et angeli in Maximo Homine constanter situm suum teneant, quod est apparentia; altera est, quod spiritus appareant in uno loco cum tamen ibi non sunt, quod est fallacia. </p>
