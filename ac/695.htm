<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第695节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>695．主施加于地狱的形式和秩序是这样：所有人都被自己的欲望和幻想捆绑和束缚，他们的生活就在于欲望和幻想。这种生活是死亡的生活，因而会转化为恐怖的折磨，恶劣到无法描述。其生活的最大乐趣就在于能相互惩罚、拷打和折磨。其手段之诡诈，是世上闻所未闻的。他们以其诡诈知道如何引发剧烈痛苦，仿佛他们就在身体中，同时还会引发可怕恐怖的幻觉，伴随着恐慌、惊惧及类似折磨。恶魔团伙从中寻求莫大快感，以至于倘若他们能将这类痛苦和折磨增加和扩长到无穷大，他们仍不会满足，还要再次燃烧，无穷无尽。然而，主会转移他们的努力，减轻痛苦。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]695.</strong> However, the Lord forms and organizes hell in such a way that the bonds and restraints of people's own desires and fantasies hold them fast. Their whole life consists in those desires and fantasies, and because their life is a living death, it turns into tortures so dreadful that they cannot be described.<br />The most intense pleasure of their life is to punish, torment, and inflict pain on each other. They use methods utterly unknown in the world. By these methods they know how to trigger acute sensations, exactly as though their victims were still in the body. They also know how to produce appalling, terrifying hallucinations, not to mention many other kinds of frights and terrors. The Devil's crew takes such passionate delight in doing this that if they could increase and intensify the pain and anguish infinitely, they still would not rest satisfied; they would burn to add another infinity of grief. But the Lord negates their efforts and softens their abuse. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 695</b></p><p><b>695.</b>
But the form and the order imposed by the Lord on the hells is such that all are held bound and tied up by their cupidities and phantasies, in which their very life consists; and this life, being a life 
of death, is turned into dreadful torments, so severe that they cannot be described. For the greatest delight of their life consists in being able to punish, torture, and torment one another, and 
this by arts unknown in the world, whereby they know how to induce exquisite suffering, just as if they were in the body, and at the same time dreadful and horrid phantasies, with terrors and horrors 
and many such torments. The diabolical crew take so great a pleasure in this that if they could increase and extend the pains and torments to infinity, they would not even then be satisfied, but would 
burn yet again to infinity; but the Lord takes away their endeavors, and alleviates the torments. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 695</b></p><p><b>695.</b>
The form and the order however which the Lord imposes on the hells are such that all there are kept chained and fettered by their own desires and delusions in which their very life consists. That life, 
being the life of death, is converted into dreadful tortures, so great as to defy description. For the greatest delight of their lives consists in their being able to punish, torture, and torment one 
another, and to do so by methods quite unknown in the world. By those methods they know how to introduce painful sensations just as if they were in the body, and also dreadful and horrible delusions, 
as well as fears and phobias, and other similar tortures. In this the devilish crew find so much pleasure that if they were able to go on unceasingly inflicting more and more pain and torture, they 
would not rest content even then but would be fired to do so even more unceasingly still. The Lord however diverts their endeavours and alleviates torments. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 695</b>
</p><b>695.</b>
Sed infernis talis forma et talis ordo a Domino inducitur ut omnes teneantur vincti et alligati suis cupiditatibus et phantasiis, in quibus ipsamet eorum vita consistit; quae vita, quia est mortis, 
in diros cruciatus vertitur; qui cruciatus tanti sunt ut describi nequeant; nam jucundissimum eorum vitae consistit in eo ut punire, torquere et cruciare unus alterum possit; immo per artes in mundo ignotissimas, 
quibus sciunt inducere sensus exquisitos prorsus sicut forent in corpore, tum phantasias diras et horrendas, praeter terrores et horrores, et plura similia; diabolica turba tantum voluptatis 
in eo percipiunt ut si in infinitum possent dolores et cruciatus augere et intendere, ne tunc quidem acquiescerent quin flagrarent adhuc in infinitum; sed Dominus aufert eorum conatus et lenit cruciatus. </p>
