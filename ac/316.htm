<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第316节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>316.</strong>离开天使以后，会有善灵前来接引，与他作伴，也尽其所能地给予帮助。但是，他在尘世的生活若决定他不愿与善人相处，必再次寻求离开。这过程会反复进行，直到他寻见与他尘世生活非常一致的群体。至此，他仿佛找回了自己的生命。有趣的是，他又过着与尘世相同的生活。至此，他开始重新生活。有的经过或长或短的时间，逐步被带入地狱，有的因为信主则逐步被引入天堂。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]316.</strong> When we as souls break off with them in this way, we are next welcomed by good spirits, and in their company every possible service is again performed for us. However, if our life in the world was such that we cannot stay among the good, once more we want to get away from them. The process repeats continuously until we come into contact with the type of people whose life in the world was in total agreement with ours. Among them we seem to find our own life. Then, surprising to say, we live the same kind of life with them as we had lived in the body.<br />As we sink back into that life, we experience a new beginning. Some of us move on from there toward hell after a fairly long time and some after a fairly short time. Those of us who had believed in the Lord, however, from the time of that new beginning are gradually led to heaven. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 316</b></p><p><b>316.</b>
When the soul thus dissociates himself, he is received by good spirits, who likewise render him all kind offices while he is in their company. If however his life in the world has been such that he cannot 
remain in the company of the good, he desires to be rid of these also, and this process is repeated again and again, until he associates himself with those who are in full agreement with his former 
life in the world, among whom he finds as it were his own life. And then, wonderful to say, he leads with them a life like that which he had lived when in the body. But after sinking back into such 
a life, he makes a new beginning of life; and some after a longer time, some after a shorter, are from this borne on toward hell; but such as have been in faith toward the Lord, are from that new beginning 
of life led step by step toward heaven. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 316</b></p><p><b>316.</b>
Once a soul severs his connection in this way he is then welcomed by good spirits, and while he is in their company they too render him every kindly service. But if in the world his life has been such 
that he could not abide the company of good persons, he is eager to get away from them as well. This goes on repeatedly until he enters into association with the kind of people who match completely 
the life he led in the world. With them he so to speak discovers his own life. At that point, astonishingly, he leads a life among them similar to what he had done in the body. But once souls have resumed 
that life, they then start a new phase of life. Some after a longer, others after a briefer, length of time are conducted from there to hell. But people who have dwelt in faith in the Lord, after 
the new phase has started, are gradually led towards heaven.  </p>

</p><b>316.</b>
Cum anima se ita dissociat, excipitur a spiritibus bonis, in quorum consortio cum est, etiam ei omnia officia praestantur: at si vita ejus talis in mundo fuit ut non in consortio bonorum esse potuerit, 
tunc quoque ab ii: cupit; et hoc tamdiu et toties usque dum se associat talibus qui vitae ejus in mundo prorsus conveniunt, apud quos vitam quasi suam invenit; et tunc, mirum, cum iis similem vitam 
agunt, qualem in corpore: sed cum in illam vitam relapsi sunt, tunc inde fit novum exordium vitae, quidam post majorem, quidam post minorem temporis moram, feruntur inde versus infernum; qui vero in 
fide in Dominum fuerunt, ii a novo illo exordio vitae ducuntur per gradus ad caelum. </p>
