<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1908节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1908.</strong>创世记16:4. 亚伯兰与夏甲同房，夏甲就怀了孕。她见自己有孕，就小看她的主母。<br />“亚伯兰与夏甲同房”表内在人与记忆知识情感生命的融合。“夏甲就怀了孕”表理性的最初生命。“她见自己有孕，就小看她的主母”表该理性在孕育时就轻视与良善联结的真理本身。</p>

Verse 4. And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived; and she saw that she had conceived, and her mistress was despised in her eyes. "He went in unto Hagar," signifies the conjunction of the internal 
man with the life which is of the affection of memory-knowledges; "and she conceived" signifies the first life of the rational; "and she saw that she had conceived, and her mistress was despised in 
her eyes," signifies that this rational at its conception lightly esteemed the truth itself that was adjoined to good. </p>

Verse 4 And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And she saw that she had conceived, and her mistress was despised in her eyes, 'He went in to Hagar' means the joining of the internal man to the life 
of the affection for knowledge. 'And she conceived' means the initial life of the rational. 'And she saw that she had conceived, and her mistress was despised in her eyes' means that this rational 
at its conception despised truth itself that was allied to good. </p>

</p><b>1908.</b>
Vers. 4.  Et ingressus ad Hagarem, et concepit; et vidit quod conceperit, et vilis fuit domina ejus in oculis ejus. `Ingressus ad Hagarem significat conjunctionem interni hominis cum vita quae est affectionis 
scientiarum: `et concepit' significat primam vitam rationalis: `et vidit quod conceperit, et vilis fuit domina ejus in oculis ejus' significat quod rationale hoc in conceptione sua vilipenderet 
ipsum verum adjunctum bono. </p>
