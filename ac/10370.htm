<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10370节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10370</strong>.“故此以色列人要守安息日，他们世世代代要遵行安息日”表教会真正重要的事就是承认神性本身在主的人身里面的合一，这种承认必须存在于敬拜的每一个部分中。这从“守安息日”、“遵行安息日”和“以色列人的世世代代”的含义，以及“以色列人”的代表清楚可知：“守安息日”是指关于神性本身与主之人身合一的神圣、不断的思维（参看<a href="10356.htm">10356</a>节），因而也指承认它，因为没有承认和信仰的思维不是属灵的思维；“以色列人”是指教会（参看<a href="9340.htm">9340</a>节提到的地方）；“遵行安息日”是指以一种神圣的方式敬拜这种合一，从而敬拜主的神性人身，因为这种合一就住在祂的人身里面；“以色列人的世世代代”是指在教会的每一个事物中（<a href="10282.htm">10282</a>节）。由此明显可知，“以色列人要守安息日，他们世世代代要遵行安息日”表示在敬拜的每一个部分中都承认神性本身在主之人身里面的合一。这是教会最重要的事，因而是教会的敬拜最重要的事，原因是，人类的救赎完全取决于这种合一。此外，主降世也是为了实现这种合一；所以整部圣言在其至内在意义上论述的都是这种合一，在以色列人当中设立的教会仪式在属灵层面上代表并表示它。<br />主在许多地方教导，人类的救赎取决于这种合一，因而教导对它的这种承认是教会及其敬拜最重要的事，如在约翰福音：<br />信子的人有永生；不信子的人不得见生命。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.36.htm">3:36</a>；15，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.16.htm">16</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.40.htm">6:40</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约11.25.htm">11:25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约11.26.htm">26</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约20.31.htm">20:31</a>）<br />“子”是指主的神性人身。那些不以信仰承认主的人之所以没有永生，是因为整个天堂都作出这种承认；因为主是天地之地，正如祂自己在马太福音中所教导的：<br />天上地上所有的权柄，都赐给我了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.18.htm">28:18</a>）<br />因此，天堂向那些不承认祂的人关闭；教会中那些在世上不承认祂的人在来世也不承认祂。这就是一个人死后的状态。</p>

And the sons of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to perform the Sabbath to their generations. That this signifies that the very essential of the church is the acknowledgment of the union of the Divine 
Itself in the Lord's Human, and that this must be in each and all things of worship, is evident from the signification of "keeping the Sabbath," as being continual holy thought about the union of the 
Divine Itself with the Lord's Human (see above, n. 10356), thus also acknowledgment, for thought without acknowledgment and faith is not spiritual thought; from the representation of the sons of Israel, 
as being the church (see the places cited in n. 9340); from the signification of "performing the Sabbath," as being devoutly to worship this union, thus to worship the Lord as to the Divine Human, 
for this union is in the Divine Human; and from the signification of "to the generations of the sons of Israel," as being in each and all things of the church (n. 10282). From all this it is evident that 
by "the sons of Israel keeping the Sabbath to perform the Sabbath to their generations," is signified the acknowledgment of the Divine Itself in the Lord's Human in each and all things of worship. 
The reason why this is an essential of the church, and consequently an essential of its worship, is that the salvation of the human race depends solely upon this union. Moreover the Lord came into the 
world for the sake of effecting this union. Therefore also in its inmost sense the whole Word treats of this, and the rituals of the church instituted among the sons of Israel represented it and signified 
it. [2] That the salvation of the human race is therefrom, consequently that this acknowledgment is an essential of the church and of its worship, the Lord teaches in many passages, as in John: </p>
<p> 
    He that believeth in the Son hath eternal life; but he that believeth not the Son shall not see life (John 3:36; also verses 15, 16; 6:40; 11:25, 26; 20:31). "The Son" denotes the Divine Human 
of the Lord. The reason why those have no eternal life who do not from faith acknowledge the Lord, is that the whole heaven is in this acknowledgment; for the Lord is the Lord of heaven and earth, as 
He teaches in Matthew: </p>
<p>     All power hath been given unto Me in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18); </p>
<p>and therefore heaven is closed to those who do not acknowledge Him; and he who (being within the 
church) does not make acknowledgment in the world, does not make it in the other life. Such is the state of man after death. </p>

'And the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, observing the sabbath [throughout] their generations' means that the truly essential thing of the Church is the acknowledgement of the union of the 
Divine itself within the Lord's Human, and that this acknowledgement must be present in every single part of worship. This is clear from the meaning of 'keeping the sabbath' as thought which is holy 
and goes on unceasingly regarding the union of Divinity itself to the Lord's Human, dealt with above in <a href="10356.htm">10356</a>, and so also acknowledging it, for thinking without acknowledging and believing is not spiritual 
thinking; from the representation of 'the children of Israel' as the Church, dealt with in the places referred to in <a href="9340.htm">9340</a>; from the meaning of 'observing the sabbath' as worshipping that union 
in a holy way and so worshipping the Lord's Divine Human, since that union resides within His Human; and from the meaning of 'the generations of the children of Israel' as in every single thing of the 
Church, dealt with in <a href="10282.htm">10282</a>. From all this it is evident that 'the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, observing the sabbath [throughout] your generations' means maintaining the acknowledgement 
of Divinity itself within the Lord's Human in every single part of worship. The reason why this is the essential thing of the Church and consequently of its worship is that the salvation of the human 
race depends solely on that union. For the sake also of this union the Lord came into the world; and therefore also that is what the whole Word in its inmost sense deals with and what the religious 
observances of the Church established among the children of Israel represented and meant spiritually.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The Lord Himself teaches in a number of places that the salvation of the human race depends 
on that union, consequently that the acknowledgement of it is the essential thing of the Church and of its worship, for example in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does 
not believe in the Son will not see life. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:36&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3:36</a>.  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
See also <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:15,16;%206:40;%2011:25,26;%2020:31&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3:15,16; 6:40; 11:25,26; 20:31</a>. 
</blockquote>
'The Son' is the Lord's Divine Human. The reason why those who do not in faith acknowledge the 
Lord do not have eternal life is that this acknowledgement is made by the whole of heaven; for the Lord is Lord of heaven and earth, as He Himself teaches in Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
All power in heaven and on 
earth has been given to Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2028:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 28:18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore heaven is closed to those who do not acknowledge Him; and those who do not acknowledge Him in the world - that is, those within the Church - do not 
acknowledge Him in the next life. Such is a person's condition after death.  </p>

`Et custodient filii Israelis sabbatum ad faciendum sabbatum generationibus illorum': quod significet quod ipsum essentiale Ecclesiae sit agnitio unionis ipsius Divini in Humano Domini, et quod {1}haec 
erit in omnibus et singulis cultus, constat ex significatione `custodire sabbatum' quod sit sancta cogitatio jugiter de unione ipsius Divini cum Humano Domini, de qua supra n. 10,356, ita quoque agnitio, 
nam cogitatio absque agnitione et fide non est cogitatio spiritualis; ex repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis' quod sint Ecclesia, de qua in locis citatis n. 9340; ex significatione `facere sabbatum' 
quod sit sancte colere illam unionem, ita Dominum quoad Divinum Humanum, nam in Eo est illa unio; et ex significatione `{2}generationum filiorum Israelis' quod sit in omnibus et singulis Ecclesiae, 
de qua n. 10,282; ex his patet quod per quod `custodient filii Israelis sabbatum ad faciendum sabbatum generationibus vestris' significetur agnitio ipsius Divini in Humano Domini in omnibus et singulis 
cultus; quod id essentiale Ecclesiae sit, et inde essentiale cultus ejus, est quia salus generis humani unice pendet (c)ab illa unione; propter {3}illam unitionem etiam Dominus in mundum venit; 
ideo etiam totum Verbum in sensu intimo de illa agit, ac {4} ritualia Ecclesiae apud filios Israelis institutae, illam repraesentabant [2] et significabant; {5} quod salus generis humani inde sit, consequenter 
quod agnitio illa essentiale Ecclesiae, et ejus cultus sit, docet Dominus pluribus in locis, ut apud Johannem, 	Qui credit in Filium, habet vitam aeternam; qui vero non credit Filio, non videbit 
vitam, iii 36, tum vers. 15, 16 ibi; ut et vi 40, xi 25, 26, xx 31; </p>
<p>`Filius' est Divinum Humanum Domini; quod non habeant vitam aeternam illi qui non ex fide agnoscunt Dominum, est quia totum 
caelum in agnitione illa est, {7}Dominus enim est Dominus caeli et terrae, ut Ipse docet apud Matthaeum, 	Data est Mihi omnis potestas in caelo et in terra, xxviii 18; </p>
<p>quapropter illis qui non agnoscunt 
Ipsum, clauditur caelum; et qui non agnoscit in mundo, hoc est, qui intra Ecclesiam, non agnoscit in altera vita; talis est status hominis post mortem. @1 hoc altered to haec A, hoc IT cp n. 10,355$ @2 
in generationibus$ @3 unionem illam$ @4 i omnia$ @5 i inde patet quod agnitio illius unionis, sit essentiale Ecclesiae, et omnium cultus ejus;$ @6 essentiale Ecclesiae et omnium cultus ejus
