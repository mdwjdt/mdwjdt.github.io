<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>997.</strong>“这一切我都赐给你们”表基于用的享受，即作“食物”，因为凡给予作食物之物都是为了用。至于用，情况乃是这样：凡被仁爱主导，即处于对邻之爱（包含在乐趣中的活着的快乐即源于此）的人，只关注基于用的享乐。因为没有仁爱的行为，就没有仁爱。仁爱就在于其实践或用中。爱邻如己者只会在践行仁爱或用中体验仁爱的快乐。所以，仁爱的生活是用的生活。这就是整个天堂的生活，因为主的国是相爱的国，故而是用的国。因此，一切源自仁爱的乐趣以用为乐。用越高尚，快乐就越大。因此缘故，天使照其用的本质和品质从主获得幸福。<br />一切乐趣都是这样，其用越高尚，其乐就越大。以婚姻之爱的快乐为例：由于这爱是人类社会的苗床，因而是主在天上国度的苗床，它是最伟大的用，所以，如前所述，它里面包含大量的快乐，以致它构成天堂的幸福。一切其它乐趣也一样，其差别取决于用的优质程度。这些用极其多，而且各种各样，以致它们几乎难以被划分为属和种。有些用与主的国或主联系更紧密、更直接，有些用则相对更遥远、更间接。由此进一步清楚看出，一切乐趣都被赐给了人，但仅仅是为了用的缘故；因此，尽管他们照着所发挥的功用而各不相同，但都共享天堂的幸福，并通过它而存活。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]997.</strong> All of it given to you means enjoying it because it is useful, which is the same as receiving it as food, since anything given as food is given for a useful purpose.<br />As far as usefulness is concerned, the case is this: People who have charity inside, that is, love for their neighbor (which is the source of any living kind of appeal in the lower pleasures) look at the enjoyment of pleasure solely in terms of its usefulness.<br />Charity, after all, is nothing without the work of charity. Charity consists in doing — in being useful, in other words. If we love our neighbor as ourselves, we do not feel any delight in charity unless we are being active or useful. As a consequence, the life of charity is a life of usefulness. This is the life found throughout heaven, because the Lord's kingdom, since it is a realm of mutual love, is a realm of useful activity. Accordingly, all the gratification that charity offers acquires its appeal from usefulness. The more marked the usefulness, the greater the appeal. That is why the essential nature and quality of an angel's occupation determines the kind of happiness the Lord gives him or her.<br />[2] The situation is the same with all lower pleasures; the more marked their usefulness, the greater their appeal. Take for a single example the pleasure that married love entails. Because this pleasure provides the breeding ground for human society and through it for the Lord's realm in the heavens, and because this is the most important function there is, it holds within it such ecstasy that it is, as they say, heavenly bliss.<br />Circumstances are similar for all other kinds of gratification, with variations due to the importance of the service they perform. Those services are so richly varied that it would be hard to break them down into their major and minor categories. They all look toward the Lord's kingdom, that is, to the Lord, some more closely and directly and others more distantly and indirectly.<br />This again leads to the conclusion that all kinds of lower pleasures are granted to us, but only for the sake of their use, and that as a result, because of the use they perform, each in its own way is brimming and alive with heaven's happiness. </p>

Have I given it all to you. That this signifies enjoyment on account of use, is because it is "for food"; for whatever is given for food is for use. With regard to use: those who are in charity, that 
is, in love to the neighbor (from which is the delight in pleasures that is alive), pay no regard to the enjoyment of pleasures except on account of the use. For there is no charity apart from works 
of charity; it is in its practice or use that charity consists. He who loves the neighbor as himself perceives no delight in charity except in its exercise, or in use; and therefore a life of charity 
is a life of uses. Such is the life of the whole heaven; for the kingdom of the Lord, because it is a kingdom of mutual love, is a kingdom of uses. Every pleasure therefore which is from charity, has 
its delight from use. The more noble the use, the greater the delight. Consequently the angels have happiness from the Lord according to the essence and quality of their use.  [2] And so it is with every 
pleasure-the more noble its use, the greater its delight. For example, the delight of conjugial love: because this love is the seminary of human society, and thereby of the Lord's kingdom in the 
heavens, which is the greatest of all uses, it has in it so much delight that it is the very happiness of heaven. It is the same with all other pleasures, but with a difference according to the excellence 
of the uses, which are so manifold that they can scarcely be classed in genera and species, some having regard more nearly and directly, and some more remotely and indirectly, to the kingdom of the 
Lord, or to the Lord. From these things it is further evident that all pleasures are granted to man, but only for the sake of use; and that they thus, with a difference from the use in which they are, 
partake of heavenly happiness and live from it. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 997</b></p><p><b>997.</b>
Its being 'given all to you' means enjoyment on account of use, which is 'for food', for whatever is given for food is for use. As regards use, the situation is this: People who are governed by charity, 
that is, who dwell in love towards the neighbour - from which love the living delight contained in pleasures derives - have no regard for the enjoyment of pleasures except on account of the use that 
is served; for charity does not exist if there are no works of charity. It is in the exercise of it, that is, in use, that charity consists. Someone who loves the neighbour as himself never experiences 
the delight of charity except in the exercise of it, or in use. Consequently the life of charity is a life of uses. Such life pervades the whole of heaven, for the Lord's kingdom, being a kingdom 
of mutual love, is a kingdom of uses. Every pleasure therefore that springs from charity finds its delight in use, and the more pre-eminent the use the greater the delight. For this reason it is the 
very being and nature of a use which determines the happiness that angels have from the Lord. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The situation with every pleasure is that the more pre-eminent its use is, the greater is its delight. 
Take one example, the delight of conjugial love: since the seed-bed of human society derives from it, and from that seed-bed the Lord's kingdom in heaven, which constitutes the greatest use of all, 
it therefore contains, as has been stated, so much delight within itself as to constitute heavenly happiness. The same applies to all other pleasures, their differences depending on the excellence of 
their respective uses. Those uses are so many and various that they can scarcely be divided into genera and species. One use will relate more closely and directly to the Lord's kingdom, or the Lord, 
another more remotely and indirectly. From these considerations it is also clear that all pleasures are available to man, yet only for the sake of the use they serve; and thus though they vary according 
to the use they serve, they share in and receive their life from heavenly happiness. </p>

</p><b>997.</b>
Quod 'dari vobis id omne' significet fruitionem ob usum, quod est 'in cibum,' nam quicquid in cibum datur, est in usum; quod usum attinet, ita se habet, quod illi qui in charitate, hoc est, in amore 
erga proximum sunt, a quo amore jucundum voluptatum quod vivum est, non spectent fruitionem voluptatum quam propter usum; nam charitas nulla est nisi sint opera charitatis; in exercitio seu usu consistit 
charitas; qui amat proximum ut se, nusquam jucundum charitatis percipit nisi in exercitio seu in usu, quare vita charitatis est vita usuum; talis vita est totius caeli, nam regnum Domini quia est 
regnum amoris mutui, est regnum usuum; ideo omnis voluptas quae ex charitate, ex usu habet suum jucundum; quo insignior usus, eo majus jucundum; inde est quod secundum essentiam et qualitatem usus, angeli 
habeant felicitatem a Domino.  [2] Ita se habet cum omni voluptate, quo insignior usus ejus est, eo jucundum ejus est majus; ut solum pro exemplo jucundum amoris conjugialis, quia inde seminarium 
societatis humanae, et ex hoc regnum Domini in caelis, qui usus omnium maximus est, ideo tantum jucunditatis ei inest, ut dictum, quod sit felicitas caelestis: cum ceteris voluptatibus se similiter 
habet sed cum differentia secundum praestantiam usuum; qui usus tam multiplices sunt ut vix in genera et species possint dispesci; quorum unus proximius et directius, alter remotius et obliquius, spectat 
regnum Domini seu Dominum.  Ex his quoque constat quod omnes voluptates homini concessae sint sed propter usum; quae sic ex usu in quo sunt, cum differentia, ex felicitate caelesti participant et vivunt. </p>
