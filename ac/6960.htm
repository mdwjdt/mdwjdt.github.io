<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6960节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6960.</strong>“把手放在怀里”表将真理变成他们自己的。这从“手”和“怀”的含义清楚可知：“手”是指能力，如前所述（<a href="6947.htm">6947</a>节）；“怀”是指爱，事实上，胸部对应于爱，因为胸腔里面有心和肺，而心对应于属天之爱，肺对应于属灵之爱（参看<a href="3635.htm">3635</a>，<a href="3883.htm">3883</a>-<a href="3896.htm">3896</a>，<a href="4112.htm">4112</a>-<a href="4113.htm">4113</a>，<a href="4133.htm">4133</a>节）。“怀”由此对应于爱，故也表示人自己的东西，因为构成一个人的爱之物就是他自己的东西。因此，“把手放在怀里”在此表示将某种东西变成人自己的。所表示的是将真理变成人自己的，这一点从接下来的内容，以及以下事实明显看出来：属灵的能力在于真理（参看<a href="6948.htm">6948</a>节）。<br />“怀”表示属于人的真正自我的东西，因而表示人自己的东西，由此表示将某种东西变成人自己的，并通过爱与之联结，这一点从以下经文清楚看出来：<br />不要信靠同伴，不要信任领袖；要守住你的口，要向那躺在你怀中的守住你口的门户。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥7.5.htm">7:5</a>）<br />“躺在你怀中的”表示通过爱与别人结合的人。也正因如此，妻子被称为“丈夫怀中的妻”（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申28.54.htm">28:54</a>；撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下12.8.htm">12:8</a>）；丈夫被称为“妻子怀中的丈夫”（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申28.56.htm">28:56</a>）；这是因为一个属于另一个。诗篇：<br />我所求的都归到自己的怀中。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗35.13.htm">35:13</a>）<br />这表示它将归回自己。<br />主啊，求你记念仆人们所受的羞辱，记念我怎样将一切大民存在我怀里。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗89.50.htm">89:50</a>）<br />这表示与他自己同在之物，如同他自己的东西。以赛亚书：<br />祂必像牧人牧养自己的羊群，用膀臂聚集羊羔，把它们抱在怀中。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.11.htm">40:11</a>）<br />此处意思也一样。<br />路加福音:<br />要给予，就必有给予你们的；必用好的量器，连摇带按、上尖下流地倒在你们怀里。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路6.38.htm">6:38</a>）<br />“倒在你们怀里”表示赐予他们，如同他们自己的。同一福音书：<br />后来拉散路死了，被天使带去放在亚伯拉罕的怀里。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路16.22.htm">16:22</a>）<br />“放在亚伯拉罕的怀里”表示凭通过爱与主的结合而被带到主那里（“亚伯拉罕”表示主）。<br />约翰福音：<br />门徒中有一个人，是耶稣所爱的，斜靠在耶稣怀里；那人紧靠着耶稣的胸膛，问祂说，主啊，是谁呢？（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.23.htm">13:23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约13.25.htm">25</a>）<br />“斜靠在怀里”明显表示被爱，并通过爱结合。<br />从来没有人看见神，只有在父怀里的独生子将祂表明出来。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.18.htm">1:18</a>）<br />“在父怀里”表示为一。<br />在以下经文中，“怀”表示属于人的真正自我的东西，以及将某种东西变成人自己的，但不是通过爱：<br />我必施行报应，必将你们的罪孽，和你们列祖的罪孽，一同报应在他们怀中；我必把他们所行的量在他们的怀中。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.6.htm">65:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.7.htm">7</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />耶和华施慈爱与千万人，又将父亲的罪孽报应在他们之后的子孙的怀中。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶32.18.htm">32:18</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />主啊，愿你将我们邻邦所羞辱你的羞辱，加七倍报应在他们怀里！（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗79.12.htm">79:12</a>）<br />“报应在他们怀里”表赐给他们自己或他们的真正自我。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6960</b></p><p><b>6960.</b>
Bring now thy hand into thy bosom. That this signifies the appropriation of truth, is evident from the signification of "hand," as being power (of which above, n. 6947); and from the signification of 
"bosom," as being love; for that which is of the breast corresponds to love, because therein is the heart, which corresponds to celestial love, and the lungs, which correspond to spiritual love (see 
n. 3635, 3883-3896, 4112-4113, 4133). And as from this the bosom corresponds to love, by it is also signified man's own, for that is man's own which is of his love. Therefore here by "bringing the hand 
into the bosom" is signified appropriation; that it is the appropriation of truth, is plain from what follows, and also from the fact that spiritual power consists in truth (see n. 6948). [2] That 
the "bosom" denotes that very thing which belongs to man, thus his own, and from this, appropriation and conjunction by love, is evident from the following passages: </p>
<p>     Confide ye not in a companion, 
put not trust in a guide; keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom (Micah 7:5); </p>
<p>where "she that lieth in the bosom" denotes one who has been conjoined with him by means of love. 
For this also a wife is called "the wife of her husband's bosom" (Deut. 28:54; 2 Sam. 12:8); and a husband is called "the husband of his wife's bosom" (Deut. 28:56); and this because one belongs to 
the other. And in David: </p>
<p>     My prayer shall fall back upon my bosom (Ps. 35:13); </p>
<p>meaning that it would return to himself.      Remember, Lord, the reproach of Thy servants, how I do bear in my bosom 
all the great peoples (Ps. 89:50); </p>
<p>meaning with himself, as his own. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     He feedeth his flock like a shepherd, He gathereth the lambs in His arm, and carrieth them in His bosom (Isa. 
40:11); </p>
<p>where the sense is the same. [3] In Luke: </p>
<p>     Give, and it shall be given to you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, shall be given into your bosom (Luke 6:38); </p>
<p>"to 
be given into the bosom" denotes for themselves as their own. In the same: </p>
<p>     And it came to pass that Lazarus died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom (Luke 16:22); </p>
<p>"to be 
carried into Abraham's bosom" denotes to the Lord (who is meant by "Abraham"), from conjunction through love. [4] And in John: </p>
<p>     There was lying in Jesus' bosom one of His disciples, whom Jesus loved; 
he, leaning on Jesus' breast, saith unto Him, Lord who is it? (John 13:23, 25); </p>
<p>"to lie in the bosom" manifestly denotes to be loved, and to be conjoined through love. Again: </p>
<p>     No one hath 
ever seen God; the only-begotten son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath set Him forth (John 1:18); </p>
<p>"in the bosom of the Father" denotes to be one. [5] The "bosom" denotes that very thing which 
belongs to man, and also appropriation not by love, in the following passages: </p>
<p>     I will recompense, I will recompense upon their bosom your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together; 
I will measure the price of their work upon their bosom (Isa. 14:6-7). Jehovah doing mercy to thousands, and recompensing the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their sons after them (Jer. 
32:18).      Recompense to our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom their reproach wherewith they have reproached Thee, O Lord (Ps. 79:12); </p>
<p>"to recompense into their bosom" denotes into themselves. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6960</b></p><p><b>6960.</b>
'Put your hand into your bosom' means making truth their own. This is clear from the meaning of 'hand' as power, dealt with above in <a href="6947.htm">6947</a>; and from the meaning of 'bosom' as love, for the parts of the 
chest correspond to love since the chest holds within it the heart, which corresponds to celestial love, and the lungs, which correspond to spiritual love, <a href="3635.htm">3635</a>, <a href="3883.htm">3883</a>-<a href="3896.htm">3896</a>, <a href="4112.htm">4112</a>, <a href="4113.htm">4113</a>, <a href="4133.htm">4133</a>. And as 
'the bosom' therefore corresponds to love it also means that which is one's own, because what constitutes a person's love is that which is his own. For this reason 'putting a hand into one's bosom' here 
means making something one's own. The fact that making truth one's own is what is meant is evident from the things that follow in the narrative and also from the consideration that truth is what spiritual 
power consists in, <a href="6948.htm">6948</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that 'the bosom' means that which is a person's true self, and so that which is his own, and from this means making something one's own and joining to 
oneself through love, is clear from the following places: In Micah, </p>
<blockquote>
Do not trust in a companion, put no confidence in a leader; from her who is lying in your bosom guard the doors of your mouth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Micah%207:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Micah 7:5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Her lying in the bosom' stands for one who has been joined to another through love. So it is also that a wife is called the wife of her husband's bosom, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2028:54;%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 28:54; 2</a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Sam%2012:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Sam 12:8</a>, and a husband 
is called the husband of his wife's bosom, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2028:56&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 28:56</a>; and this is because one belongs to the other. In David, </p>
<p>My prayer falls back onto my bosom. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2035:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 35:13</a>. </p>
<p>This stands for its return to 
himself. In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
Remember, O Lord, the reproach of Your servants - [how] I bear in my bosom all the great peoples. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2089:50&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 89:50</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This stands for what is present with himself, as that which 
is his own. In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
He pastures His flock like a shepherd, He gathers the lambs into His arm, and He carries them in His bosom. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2040:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 40:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the meaning is similar. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
Give, 
and it will be given to you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over will be given into your bosom. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%206:38&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 6:38</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Being given into the bosom' stands for imparting them as 
their own. In the same gospel, </p>
<p>After that it happened that Lazarus died and was taken away by the angels into Abraham's bosom. Luke <a href="16.htm">16</a>.<a href="22.htm">22</a>. </p>
<p>'Being taken away into Abraham's bosom' stands for being 
taken to the Lord - whom 'Abraham' is used to mean - by virtue of being joined to Him through love. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In John, </p>
<p>There was reclining on Jesus' bosom one of the disciples, whom Jesus loved. Falling 
towards Jesus' breast he said to Him, Lord, who is it? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2013:23,%2025&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 13:23, 25</a>. </p>
<p>'Reclining on the bosom' plainly stands for being loved and being joined through love. In the same gospel,  </p>
<blockquote>
Nobody has 
ever seen God; the only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, He has made Him known. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'In the bosom of the Father' stands for being one. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 'The bosom' stands for that which 
is a person's true self, and for making something one's own but not through love, in the following places: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will repay, I will repay into their bosom your iniquities, and the iniquities 
of your fathers together. I will measure the value of their work first into their bosom. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2065:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 65:6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah shows mercy to thousands and He repays the iniquity of the fathers 
into the bosom of their sons after them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2031:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 31:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Repay our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom, their reproach to which they have subjected You, O Lord. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2079:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 79:12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Repaying 
into their bosom' stands for imparting to their true selves.  </p>

`Adduc manum tuam in sinum tuum': quod significet appropriationem veri, constat ex significatione `manus' quod sit potentia, de qua supra n. 6947; et ex significatione `sinus' quod sit amor, quae enim 
pectoris sunt correspondent amori, nam inibi est `cor' quod correspondet amori caelesti et `pulmo' qui correspondet amori spirituali, n. 3635, 3883-3896, 4112, 4113, 4133; et quia `sinus' inde correspondet 
amori, per illum quoque significatur proprium, nam id hominis proprium est quod est amoris ejus; idcirco hic per `adducere manum in sinum' significatur appropriatio; quod sit appropriatio veri, 
ex sequentibus patet, tum ex eo quod in vero consistat potentia spiritualis, n. 6948. 	2 Quod `sinus' sit ipsum illud quod hominis, ita proprium, ac inde appropriatio et conjunctio per amorem, constat 
ex his locis: apud Micham, Ne confidite socio, ne fiduciam ponite in duce, a cubante in sinu tuo custodi januas oris tui, vii 5; </p>
<p>`cubans in sinu' pro illo qui ei per amorem conjunctus est; inde 
quoque uxor vocatur uxor sinus mariti, Deut. xxviii (x)54; 2 Sam. xii 8; et maritus vocatur maritus sinus uxoris, Deut. xxviii 56, et hoc quia unus alterius est: apud Davidem, Precatio mea super sinum 
meum relabitur, Ps. xxxv (x)13; </p>
<p>pro quod ad ipsum: apud eundem, Memento, Domine, opprobrii servorum tuorum, portare mei in sinu meo omnes magnos populos, Ps. lxxxix (x)51 [A.V. 50]; </p>
<p>pro apud seipsum, 
{1}ut proprium: apud Esaiam, Sicut pastor gregem suum pascit, in brachium suum colligit agnos, et in sinu sua portat, xl 11; </p>
<p>similiter: apud Lucam, 3 Date et dabitur vobis, mensura bona, pressa, 
agitata, et superfluens, dabitur in sinum vestrum, vi 38; </p>
<p>`dari in sinum' pro illis ipsis ut proprium: apud eundem, Dein factum ut moreretur Lazarus, et auferretur ab angelis in sinum Abrahami, 
xvi 22; </p>
<p>`auferri in sinum Abrahami' pro ad {2} Dominum, Qui intelligitur per `Abrahamum,' ex conjunctione per amorem: apud Johannem, 4 Erat accumbens unus discipulorum in sinu Jesu, quem amabat Jesus; 
allapsus ille ad pectus Jesus, dicit Ipsi, Domine, quis est? xiii 23, 25; </p>
<p>`accumbere in sinu' manifeste pro amari, ac per amorem conjungi: apud eundem, Deum nemo vidit unquam; Unigenitus Filius,
