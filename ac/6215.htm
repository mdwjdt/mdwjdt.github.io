<p>     Genesis 48 </p>
<p>     1. And it came to pass after these words, 
that one said unto Joseph, Behold thy father is sick; and he took his two sons with him, Manasseh and Ephraim.      2. And one told Jacob, and said, Behold thy son Joseph cometh unto thee; and Israel 
strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.      3. And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Shaddai appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,      4. And He said unto me, Behold I will 
make thee fruitful, and will cause thee to be multiplied, and will make of thee a company of peoples; and I will give this land to thy seed after thee for an eternal possession.      5. And now thy 
two sons, who were born to thee in the land of Egypt, before I came unto thee into Egypt, they are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.      6. And thy generation, which 
thou begettest after them, shall be thine; upon the name of their brethren they shall be called in their inheritance.      7. And I, in my coming from Paddan, Rachel died upon me in the land of 
Canaan, in the way, when there was still a tract of land to come unto Ephrath; and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath, the same is Bethlehem.      8. And Israel saw the sons of Joseph, and said, 
Whose are these?      9. And Joseph said unto his father, These are my sons, whom God hath given me here. And he said, Take them I pray unto me, and I will bless them.      10. And the eyes of Israel 
were heavy with old age; he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them and embraced them.      11. And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy faces; and lo 
God hath made me see thy seed also.      12. And Joseph brought them away from his thighs; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.      13. And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right 
hand on Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand on Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.      14. And Israel put forth his right hand, and put it upon Ephraim's head, and he 
was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, he put forth his hands crosswise; for Manasseh was the firstborn.      15. And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my fathers walked, 
Abraham and Isaac, the God who feedeth me since I am unto this day,      16. The Angel who redeemeth me from all evil, bless the boys; and let my name be called in them, and the name of my fathers 
Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow unto a multitude in the midst of the earth.      17. And Joseph saw that his father put his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, and it was evil in his eyes; 
and he laid hold of the hand of his father to remove it from upon Ephraim's head upon Manasseh's head.      18. And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father; for this is the firstborn; put thy 
right hand upon his head.      19. And his father refused, and said, I know, my son, I know; he also shall be for a people, and he also shall become great; and nevertheless his younger brother shall 
be greater than he, and his seed shall be the fullness of the nations.      20. And he blessed them in this day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh; 
and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.      21. And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die; and God shall be with you, and shall bring you back unto the land of your fathers.      22. And I give thee one 
portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow. </p>

<p>GENESEOS CAPUT QUADRAGESIMUM OCTAVUM </p>
<p>1.  Et fuit post verba illa, et dixit ad Josephum, Ecce pater tuus aegrotat; 
et accepit duos filios suos secum, Menashen et Ephraimum. 2.  Et indicavit Jacobo, et dixit, Ecce filius tuus Joseph venit ad te; et confirmavit se Israel, et sedit super lecto. 3.  Et dixit 
Jacob ad Josephum, DEUS Shaddai visus ad me in Luz in terra Canaan, et benedixit mihi. 4.  Et dixit ad me, Ecce Ego fructificans te, et multiplicar faciam te, et dabo te ad coetum populorum, et dabo 
terram hanc semini tuo post te possessionem aeternam. 5.  Et nunc duo filii tui nati tibi in terra Aegypti usque ad me venire ad te Aegyptum, mihi illi, Ephraim et Menasheh, sicut Reuben  et Shimeon 
erunt mihi. 6.  Et generatio tua quam generas post illos, tibi erunt; super nomine fratrum suorum vocabuntur in hereditate sua. 7.  Et ego in veniendo me e Paddan, moriebatur super me Rachel in terra 
Canaan in via in adhuc tractus terrae ad veniendum Ephratam, {1}et sepelivi illam ibi in via Ephrath, ea Bethlehem. @1 I here o this clause$ 8.  Et vidit Israel filios Josephi, et dixit, Cui illi. 9. 
 Et dixit Joseph ad patrem suum, Filii mei hi, quos dedit mihi DEUS hic; et dixit, Accipe illos quaeso ad me, et benedicam illis.  10.  Et oculi Israelis graves erant prae senectute, non potuit videre; 
et accedere fecit illos ad eum, et osculatus illos, et amplexus illos. 11.  Et dixit Israel ad Josephum, Videre facies tuas non cogitavi, et ecce videre fecit mihi DEUS etiam semen tuum. 12. 
 Et abduxit Joseph illos ex femoribus ejus, et incurvavit se ad faciem suam terram. 13.  Et accepit Joseph ambos illos, Ephraimum in dextra sua a sinistra Israelis, et Menashen in sinistra sua a dextra 
Israelis, et accedere fecit ad eum. 14.  Et misit Israel dextram suam et posuit super capite Ephraimi, et is minor, et sinistram suam super capite Menashis, conversim misit manus suas, quia Menasheh 
primogenitus. 15.  Et benedixit Josepho, et dixit, DEUS coram Quo ambularunt patres mei, Abraham et Jishak, DEUS {1}pascens me ab illo me usque ad diem hunc. @1 A I pavens here, also 6274, 6277; 
Sch is qui pavit me, and pavit is past tense of both paveo (=to dread) and pasco (=to feed).  Heb    (=to feed, to be a shepherd to).$ 16.  Angelus redimens me ab omni malo, benedicat pueris, et vocabitur 
in illis nomen meum, et nomen patrum meorum Abrahami et Jishaki, et crescant ad multitudinem in medio terrae. 17.  Et vidit Joseph quod posuit pater ejus manum dextram suam super capite Ephraimi, 
et malum fuit in oculis ejus, et apprehendit manum patris sui ad removendum illam a super capite Ephraimi super caput Menashis. 18.Et dixit Joseph ad patrem suum, Non ita pater mi, quia hic primogenitus, 
pone dextram tuam super capite ejus. 19.  Et renuit pater ejus, et dixit, Scio, fili mi, scio, etiam hic erit ad populum, et etiam hic magnus fiet; et verumtamen frater ejus minor magnus fiet 
prae illo, et semen illius erit plenitudo gentium. 20.  Et benedixit illis in die hoc, dicendo, In te benedicet Israel, dicendo, Ponat te DEUS sicut Ephraimum et sicut Menashen; et posuit Ephraimum 
ante Menashen. 21.  Et dixit Israel ad Josephum, Ecce ego morior, et erit DEUS cum vobis, et reducet vos ad terram patrum vestrorum.   22.  Et ego do tibi portionem unam super fratres tuos, quam sumpsi 
e manu Emoraei gladio meo et arcu meo.  </p>
