<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3322节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3322.</strong>“因此以扫起名叫以东”表所产生良善的性质，真理的教义与这良善联结。这从“起名叫”或“名叫”的含义和“以东”的代表的清楚可知，“起名叫”或“名叫”是指本质（参看<a href="144.htm">144</a>，<a href="145.htm">145</a>，<a href="1754.htm">1754</a>，<a href="1896.htm">1896</a>，<a href="2009.htm">2009</a>，<a href="2724.htm">2724</a>，<a href="3006.htm">3006</a>节）。以扫在圣言各处被提及，以东也是。在这些地方，“以扫”是指属世人的良善，不过，是在真理的教义与这良善联结，以及由出于理性人的流注所带来的生活良善与其联结之前的；而“以东”则表示与真理的教义联结后的属世人的良善。但就反面意义而言，“以扫”表自我之爱的邪恶，不过，是这爱与虚假联结之前的；“以东”则表示这爱与虚假联结后的邪恶。如前面频繁所示，圣言中的绝大多数名字也具有反面意义，因为随着时间推移，在教会中作为良善与真理形式的事物通过各种掺杂而逐渐堕落为邪恶与虚假的形式。<br />“以扫”和“以东”表示这类事物，这一点从以下经文可以看出来。以赛亚书：<br />这从以东的波斯拉来，穿红衣服、装扮华美、能力广大、大步行走的是谁呢？你的装扮为何有红色？你的衣服为何像踹酒榨的呢？我独自踹酒榨，众民中无一人与我同在。我观看，但没有人帮助；我诧异，没有人扶持。所以我自己的膀臂为我施行拯救。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.1.htm">63:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.5.htm">5</a>）<br />此处很明显，“以东”是指主；显然，它是指主的神圣属世人的神性良善，因为所论述的主题是良善与真理在主的人性中的联结，以及祂藉以将这二者联结起来的试探的争战。“衣服”在此表示属世人的真理，或与其它真理相比，较为低级的真理（参看<a href="2576.htm">2576</a>节）；“红色”是指属世人的良善（<a href="3300.htm">3300</a>节）。“我独自踹酒榨，众民中无一人与我同在。我观看，但没有人帮助；我诧异，没有人扶持。所以我自己的膀臂为我施行拯救”则描述了主凭自己的能力通过试探的争战将属世人中的真理与良善联结起来，“膀臂”表能力（参看<a href="878.htm">878</a>节）。<br />士师记：<br />耶和华啊，你从西珥出来，走过以东田野的时候，地震天漏，云也落雨；山岳摇摇欲坠。（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士5.4.htm">5:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/士5.5.htm">5</a>）<br />“走过以东田野”和以赛亚书中“从以东来”意思几乎一样。同样在摩西五经：<br />耶和华从西乃而来，从西珥向他们发晨光。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.2.htm">33:2</a>）<br /><br />我看他却不在现时，我望他却不在近日。有星要出于雅各，有杖要兴于以色列；以东将成为产业，西珥将成为他敌人的产业，但以色列却要得胜。他要向雅各掌权，除灭城中的余民。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.17.htm">24:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.19.htm">19</a>）<br />这论及主的降世，祂的人性本质被称为“出于雅各的星”和“出于以色列的杖”。作为“产业”的“以东”和“西珥”表示主的神圣属世人的神性良善。它们成为“他敌人的产业”表示这一切要成功取代那些以前存在于属世人中的事物。那时向其中的真理掌权由“他要向雅各掌权，除灭城中的余民”来表示，因为“雅各”表示属世人的真理（参看<a href="3305.htm">3305</a>节），“城”表教义（<a href="402.htm">402</a>，<a href="2268.htm">2268</a>，<a href="2449.htm">2449</a>，<a href="2712.htm">2712</a>，<a href="2943.htm">2943</a>，<a href="3216.htm">3216</a>节）。当这些真理从属并顺服于良善时，就说向它们掌权。在此之前，它们被称为“仇敌”，因为它们不断抵抗，如前所示（<a href="3321.htm">3321</a>节）。<br />阿摩司书：<br />到那日，我必竖起大卫倒塌的帐幕，堵住其中的破口。把那破坏的建立起来，重新修造，像古日一样；使他们得以东所余剩的和所有称为我名下的民族。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩9.11.htm">9:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩9.12.htm">12</a>）<br />“大卫的帐幕”表主的教会和对主的敬拜；“以东所余剩的”表教会中那些处于良善的人；“所有称为我名下的民族”表教会外那些处于良善的人。“民族”是指那些处于良善的人（参看<a href="1259.htm">1259</a>，<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>，<a href="1416.htm">1416</a>，<a href="1849.htm">1849</a>节）。诗篇：<br />我要向以东抛鞋。谁能领我进坚固城？谁能引我到以东？神啊，你不是丢弃了我们吗？（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗60.8.htm">60:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗60.10.htm">10</a>）<br />此处“以东”表属世人的良善，这从“鞋”的含义明显看出来，“鞋”是指属世人的最低级部分（<a href="1748.htm">1748</a>节）。<br />但以理书：<br />到末了时期，南方王要与他交战，北方王必用战车势如暴风来攻击他，也必如洪水泛滥，横流漫过；又必进入那荣美之地，有许多国就被倾覆；但这些必脱离他的手，就是以东人、摩押人和亚扪人初熟的果子。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但11.40.htm">11:40</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但11.41.htm">41</a>）<br />这论及教会的最终状态。“北方王”表虚假，或也可说，表那些处于虚假的人。“以东”表那些处于简单的良善之人，就是诸如那些构成主的外在教会之人所具有的那类良善。这同样适用于“摩押人和亚扪人”（<a href="2468.htm">2468</a>节）；由于这二者，即“以东”和“摩押”表那些处于良善的人，故在许多经文中，这二者一起被提及。不同之处在于，“以东”是指与真理的教义联结的属世人的良善，而“摩押”是指诸如那些这二者在他们里面尚未联结起来的人所具有的那类属世良善。这二者表面上看起来很像，但它们内在却不一样。<br />由此明显可知为何经上说：<br />不可憎恶以东人，因为他是你的弟兄；不可憎恶埃及人，因为你在他的地上作过寄居的。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申23.7.htm">23:7</a>）<br />由于“以东人”表示属世人的良善，“埃及人”表示其真理，就是记忆知识的真理（<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>，<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>节），所以这二者以正面意义被提及。这也表明为何耶和华对摩西说，他们不可与以扫的子孙争竞，他们的地，连脚掌可踏之处，我都不给雅各的子孙（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申2.4.htm">2:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申2.6.htm">6</a>）。<br />但就反面意义而言，“以扫”和“以东”代表那些因以下事实而厌恶良善的人，即：他们完全蔑视真理，不愿与任何信之真理联结，这主要是因为自我之爱。所以，从反面意义上说，这种人由“以扫”和“以东”来表示。这同样由率领许多人出来、强力阻止以色列人从他的境界过去的以东王来代表（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民20.14.htm">20:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民20.22.htm">22</a>）。这邪恶，也就是自我之爱的邪恶，具有这样的性质，以至于不接受信之真理，因而也不接受真理的教义。它在圣言的各处都以“以扫”和“以东”来描述，同时当它变得如此时，还以教会的状态来描述。如耶利米书：<br />论以东。提幔中再没有智慧吗？谋略从明达人中灭没了么？他们的智慧都腐朽了吗？底但的居民哪，要转身逃跑，往深密处居住；因为我必使以扫的灾殃临到他。我要使以扫赤露，显出他的隐密处，他不能自藏。他的种、弟兄、邻舍尽都灭绝。你撇下孤儿，我要保全他们、使他们存活；你的寡妇可以倚靠我。以东必成为荒场，凡经过的人就受惊骇，又因他一切的灾祸嗤笑。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.7.htm">49:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.8.htm">8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.10.htm">10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.17.htm">17</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />他们说，使以色列的名不再被记念；他们同心商议，并且立约，要抵挡你，以东的帐棚和以实玛利人、摩押人和夏甲。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗83.4.htm">83:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗83.6.htm">6</a>）<br />俄巴底亚书：<br />主耶和华论以东说，看哪！我必使你在列族中成为小的；你必被大大藐视。你心中的狂傲欺骗了你，住在岩缝中，居住在高处的啊；你心里说，谁能将我拉下地去呢？你虽如大鹰高飞，在星宿之间搭窝，我必从那里拉下你来。以扫何竟被搜寻？他隐藏的宝物何竟被查出！到那日，我岂不从以东除灭智慧人，从以扫山除灭聪明人？因你向兄弟雅各行强暴，羞愧必遮盖你，你也必永远被剪除。雅各家必成为大火，约瑟家必为火焰，以扫家必如碎秸；火必将他们烧着吞灭；以扫家必无余剩的；南方的人必得以扫山。（俄巴底亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/俄1.1.htm">1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/俄1.4.htm">4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/俄1.6.htm">6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/俄1.8.htm">8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/俄1.10.htm">10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/俄1.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/俄1.19.htm">19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/俄1.21.htm">21</a>）<br />在这段经文中，“以扫”和“以东”表属世人的邪恶，这邪恶源于自我之爱，蔑视并拒绝一切真理，由此导致毁灭。<br />以西结书：<br />人子，你要面向西珥山发预言攻击它，对它说，主耶和华如此说，西珥山哪，我与你为敌，必伸手攻击你，使你荒凉荒废。因为你永怀仇恨，在以色列人罪孽到了尽头的时候，将他们交与刀剑人之手。因为你曾说，这两族、这两地必归于我，我们必拥有它，其实耶和华仍在那里。你就知道我耶和华听见了你的一切毁谤，就是你攻击以色列山的话。西珥山和全以东哪，就是它的全部，你们必都荒凉。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结35.2.htm">35:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结35.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结35.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结35.10.htm">10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结35.12.htm">12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结35.15.htm">15</a>）<br />此处很明显，就反面意义而言，“以东”表那些蔑视、拒绝并毁谤“以色列山”所表示的属灵良善与真理之人。<br /><br />主耶和华如此说，我在妒火中说话攻击列族中余剩的人和全以东，它们满心欢喜、满怀轻蔑，将我的地归自己为业。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结36.5.htm">36:5</a>）<br />此处意思也一样，“将地归自己为业”表使教会荒废，即使教会的良善与真理的荒废。<br />玛拉基书：<br />耶和华攻击以色列的话。耶和华说，我曾爱你们；你们却说，你在何事上爱我们呢？以扫不是雅各的哥哥吗？我却爱雅各，憎恶以扫，使他的山荒凉。（玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛1.1.htm">1:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛1.3.htm">3</a>）<br />此处“以扫”表属世人的邪恶，这邪恶不接受“以色列”所表示的属灵真理（<a href="3305.htm">3305</a>节）和“雅各”所表示的真理的教义（<a href="3305.htm">3305</a>节）；他因此而荒凉，也就是被“憎恶”。因为“憎恶”没有其它含义，这从上面所引用有关正面意义上的以扫和以东的圣言经文明显看出来。但当真理不让自己与良善联结时，那么相反，邪恶就论及雅各，如何西阿书：<br />必照雅各所行的惩罚他，按他所做的报应他；他在腹中就取代他哥哥。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何12.2.htm">12:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何12.3.htm">3</a>）</p>

Therefore he called his name Edom. That this signifies his quality therefrom as to good, to which were adjoined the doctrinal things of truth, is evident from the signification of "calling a name," or 
of "calling by name," as being the quality (see n. 144, 145, 1754, 1896, 2009, 2724, 3006); and from the representation of Edom. There is frequent mention in the Word of Esau, and also of Edom; and 
by "Esau" is there signified the good of the natural before the doctrinal things of truth have been thus conjoined with this good, and also the good of life from influx out of the rational; and by "Edom" 
is signified the good of the natural to which have been adjoined the doctrinal things of truth. But in the opposite sense, "Esau" signifies the evil of the love of self before falsities have been 
thus adjoined to this love; and "Edom" signifies the evil of this love when falsities have been adjoined to it. As has been frequently shown, most names in the Word have also an opposite sense, because 
the same things that in the churches have been good and true, in process of time through various adulterations degenerate into what is evil and false. [2] That such things are signified by "Esau" and 
"Edom" may be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in His apparel, marching in the multitude of 
His strength. Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and Thy garments like him that treadeth in the wine-press? I have trodden the wine-press alone, and of the peoples there was no man with Me. I 
looked, but there was none to help, I was amazed that there was none to uphold, and Mine own arm brought salvation unto Me (Isa. 63:1, 3, 5); </p>
<p>where it is clearly evident that "Edom" is the Lord; and 
that it is the Lord as to the Divine good of the Divine natural is manifest, for the subject is the conjunction of good and truth in the Lord's Human, and also the temptation combats by which He conjoined 
them. That "garments" here are the truths of the natural man, or truths relatively inferior, may be seen above (n. 2576); and that "red" is the good of the natural (n. 3300). That the Lord by His 
own power, through temptation combats, conjoined truths in the natural with good, is described by, "I have trodden the wine-press alone, and of the peoples there was no man with Me. I looked but there 
was none to help, I was amazed that there was none to uphold, and Mine own arm brought salvation unto Me." (That "arm" denotes power, see above, n. 878.) [3] In the book of Judges: </p>
<p>     O Jehovah 
when Thou wentest forth out of Seir, when Thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, the heavens also dropped, the clouds also dropped water; the mountains flowed down (Judg. 5:4-5); </p>
<p>to 
"march out of the field of Edom" signifies nearly the same as, in Isaiah, to "come out of Edom." In like manner in Moses: </p>
<p>     Jehovah came from Sinai, and rose from Seir unto them (Deut. 33:2). Again: </p>
<p> 
    I see Him, but not now; I behold Him, but not nigh; there shall come up a star out of Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of Israel; and Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a 
possession of his enemies, while Israel doeth valiantly. And he shall have dominion over Jacob, and shall destroy the remnant from the city (Num. 24:17-19); </p>
<p>treating of the coming of the Lord into the 
world, whose Human Essence is called a "star out of Jacob," and a "scepter out of Israel." "Edom" and "Seir," which should be a "possession," signify the Divine good of the Lord's Divine natural; their 
being the "possession of his enemies" signifies that this should succeed in the place of those things which were before in the natural; dominion then over truths therein is meant by "having dominion 
over Jacob, and destroying the remnant from the city." (That "Jacob" signifies the truth of the natural, see above, n. 3305; and that "city" signifies what is doctrinal, n. 402, 2268, 2449, 2712, 
2943, 3216.) Dominion is said to be had over these when they are subordinated and subjected to good; for before this they are called "enemies," because they continually resist, as was shown above (n. 
3321). [4] In Amos: </p>
<p>     In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of eternity; 
that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations that were called by My name (Amos 9:11-12); </p>
<p>the "tabernacle of David" denotes the church and worship of the Lord; the "remnant 
of Edom," those who are in good within the church; the "nations that were called by His name," those who are in good out of the church. (That "nations" are those who are in good, see above, n. 1259, 1260, 
1416, 1849.) In David: </p>
<p>     Upon Edom will I cast my shoe. Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who will lead me unto Edom? Wilt not Thou, O God? (Ps. 60:8, 10); </p>
<p>where "Edom" denotes the 
good of the natural, as is evident from the signification of "shoe," as being the lowest natural (n. 1748). [5] In Daniel: </p>
<p>     At the time of the end shall the king of the south thrust at him; and 
the king of the north shall rush upon him like a whirlwind with a chariot, and shall overflow and pass through; and when he shall come into the beauteous land many shall be overthrown; but these shall 
be rescued out of his hand, Edom and Moab, and the firstfruits of the sons of Ammon (Dan. 11:40-41); </p>
<p>where the last state of the church is treated of; the "king of the north" denotes falsities, or what 
is the same, those who are in falsities; "Edom," those who are in simple good, which is such good as exists with those who constitute the Lord's external church; in like manner "Moab" and the "sons 
of Ammon" (n. 2468); and because both, namely, "Edom" and "Moab," signify those who are in good, therefore in many passages both are named together; but the difference is that "Edom" is the good of 
the natural to which are adjoined the doctrinal things of truth, while "Moab" is natural good such as exists with those in whom these have not been conjoined; the two appear alike in the external form, 
but not in the internal. [6] From this it is now evident why it was said: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite, for he is thy brother; thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian, because thou wast a sojourner 
in his land (Deut. 23:7); </p>
<p>as by an "Edomite" is signified the good of the natural, and by an "Egyptian," the truths thereof which are those of memory-knowledge (n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462), therefore 
both are mentioned in a good sense. This shows why Jehovah said to Moses that they should not contend* with the sons of Esau, and there should not be given of their land to the sons of Jacob so much 
as for the sole of the foot to tread upon (Deut. 2:4-6). [7] But in the opposite sense by "Esau" and "Edom" are represented those who turn aside from good through the fact that they altogether despise 
truth, and are unwilling that anything of the truth of faith should be adjoined, which is chiefly owing to the love of self; and therefore in the opposite sense such persons are signified by "Esau" 
and "Edom;" as was also represented by the circumstance that the king of Edom went forth with a numerous people and a strong hand, and refused to permit Israel to pass through his border (Num. 20:14-22). 
This evil of the love of self, which is of such a nature as not to admit the truths of faith, thus neither the doctrinal things of truth, is described in various passages of the Word by "Esau" and 
"Edom," and at the same time the state of the church when it becomes of this quality; as in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Against Edom. Is wisdom no more in Teman? Is counsel perished from the intelligent? Is their 
wisdom become of an ill savor? Flee ye; they have turned themselves away, they have gone into the deep to dwell, inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him. I will make Esau 
bare, I will reveal his hidden things, and he shall not be able to hide himself; his seed is laid waste, and his brethren, and his neighbors. Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; 
and let thy widows trust in Me. Edom shall become a waste, everyone that passeth by it shall be amazed, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof (Jer. 49:7-8, 10-11, 17). [8] In David: </p>
<p>     They 
say, Let the name of Israel be no more in remembrance; for they consult together with one heart; against thee do they make a covenant, the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab, and the Hagarenes 
(Ps. 83:4-6). In Obadiah: </p>
<p>     Thus saith the Lord Jehovih concerning Edom, Behold I have made thee small among the nations; thou art greatly despised. The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, 
O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, in the height of thy habitation; that saith in thine heart, Who shall bring me down to the earth? Though thou mount on high as the eagle, and though thou 
settest thy nest among the stars, I will bring thee down from thence. How are they of Esau searched out! their hidden things discovered! Shall I not in that day destroy the wise men out of Edom, and 
the intelligent from the mount of Esau? From the slaughter on account of the violence of thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off forever. The house of Jacob shall be a fire, 
and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble; and they shall enkindle them, and devour them; and there shall not be any residue to the house of Esau; and they of the south shall 
possess the mount of Esau (Obad. 1:1-10, 18-19). In this passage "Esau" and "Edom" denote the evil of the natural man originating in the love of self, which despises and rejects all truth, whence 
comes its devastation. [9] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Son of man, set thy face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it, and say unto it, Thus saith the Lord Jehovih, I am against thee, O Mount Seir, and I 
will stretch out Mine hand against thee, and I will make thee a waste and a devastation. Because thou hast had an enmity of eternity, and hast given over the sons of Israel to the hands of the sword, 
in the time of their calamity, in the time of the iniquity of the end. Because thou hast said, These two nations, and these two lands, shall be mine, and we will possess it, and Jehovah is there. And 
thou shalt know that I Jehovah have heard all thy blasphemies, which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel. Thou shalt be a waste, O Mount Seir and all Edom, all of it (Ezek. 35:2-3, 5, 10, 
12, 15); </p>
<p>where it is very evident that in the opposite sense "Edom" denotes those who despise, reject, and vilify spiritual goods and truths, which are the "mountains of Israel." [10] Again: </p>
<p>    
 Thus saith the Lord Jehovih, If I have not spoken in the fire of My jealousy against the remains of the nations, and against all Edom, which have given My land unto themselves for a possession, with 
the joy of all their heart, with despite of soul (Ezek. 36:5); </p>
<p>where the sense is the same; to "give the land unto themselves for a possession" denotes to vastate the church, that is, the good and truth 
of the church. [11] In Malachi: </p>
<p>     The word of Jehovah against Israel. I have loved you, saith Jehovah; yet ye say, Wherein hast Thou loved us? Is not Esau Jacob's brother? Yet I loved Jacob, 
but Esau I hated, and I make his mountain a waste (Mal. 1:1-3); </p>
<p>where "Esau" denotes the evil of the natural that does not admit spiritual truth which is "Israel" (n. 3305), and what is doctrinal of 
truth which is "Jacob" (n. 3305); and on this account he is vastated, which is being "hated" (that "hating" is nothing else, is manifest from what was adduced above from the Word concerning Esau and Edom 
in a good sense); but when truth does not suffer itself to be adjoined to good, then evil is on the other hand predicated of Jacob, as in Hosea: </p>
<p>     To visit upon Jacob according to his ways; according 
to his works will He recompense him; in the womb he supplanted his brother (Hos. 12:2-3). * Literally, "mix hands."  The Hebrew garah is translated by Swedenborg and Schmidius with the Latin 
miscere manus and miscere in Deut. 2:5, 19; and in Dan 11:25 with commiscere (bello). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3322</b></p><p><b>3322.</b>
'Therefore he called his name Edom' means the resulting nature of the good, to which matters of doctrine regarding truth were allied. This is clear from the meaning of 'calling the name' or calling by 
name as the essential nature, dealt with in <a href="144.htm">144</a>, <a href="145.htm">145</a>, <a href="1754.htm">1754</a>, <a href="1896.htm">1896</a>, <a href="2009.htm">2009</a>, <a href="2724.htm">2724</a>, <a href="3006.htm">3006</a>, and from the representation of 'Edom'. In the Word Esau is mentioned in various places, as also is Edom. In those 
places 'Esau' means the good of the natural before matters of doctrine regarding truth have been joined to it, and also before the good of life brought by an influx from the rational has been joined to 
it - to natural good; while 'Edom' means the good of the natural to which matters of doctrine regarding truth have been allied. But in the contrary sense 'Esau' means the evil stemming from self-love 
before falsities have been allied to it, that is to say, to self-love, while 'Edom' means the evil stemming from that love once they have been allied to it. The majority of names in the Word, as shown 
quite often, also have the contrary sense. The reason why is that in course of time the self-same things which in the Churches were forms of good and truth deteriorated into forms of evil and falsity 
through various kinds of adulterations. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That 'Esau' and 'Edom' mean these things becomes clear from the following places: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Who is this who is coming from Edom, with spattered clothes 
from Bozrah glorious in his apparel, marching in the vast numbers of his strength? Why are you red as to your clothing, and your clothes like his that treads in the winepress? I have trodden the 
winepress alone, and from the peoples no man was with me. I looked around but there was none helping, and I wondered, and there was nobody to uphold, and my own arm saved me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2063:1-3,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 63:1-3, 5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 
it is quite clear that 'Edom' is the Lord, and the fact that it is the Lord as regards the Divine Good of the Divine Natural is evident because the subject is the joining together of good and truth in 
the Lord's Human, and the conflicts brought about by temptations through which He joined the two together. 'Clothes' here means the truths of the natural man, or truths that are lower compared with other 
truths, see <a href="2576.htm">2576</a>, while 'red' is the good of the natural man, <a href="3300.htm">3300</a>. The Lord's work in which - by His own power, and through the conflicts brought about by temptations - He joined truths present 
there to good is described by the words 'I have trodden the winepress alone, and from the peoples no man was with me. I looked around but there was none helping; I wondered, and there was nobody to uphold, 
and my own arm saved me' - 'arm' meaning power, <a href="878.htm">878</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the Book of Judges, </p>
<blockquote>
O Jehovah. when You went forth from Seir, when You set out from the field of Edom, the earth trembled, the heavens 
also dropped, the clouds indeed dropped [water], the mountains flowed down. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%205:4,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 5:4, 5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Setting out from the field of Edom' is almost the same in meaning as 'coming from Edom' in Isaiah. 
Likewise in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah came from Sinai, and dawned from Seir upon them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2033:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 33:2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
I see Him, but not now; I behold Him, but not near. A star will arise out of Jacob, 
and a sceptre will rise up out of Israel. And Edom will be an inheritance, and Seir will be an inheritance, of his enemies - with Israel doing valiantly - and will have dominion in regard to Jacob, and 
will destroy what is left of the city. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2024:17-19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 24:17-19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord's Coming into the world, His Human Essence being called 'a star out of Jacob, and a sceptre out of Israel'. 'Edom' and 
'Seir' which are to be 'an inheritance' stand for the Divine Good of the Lord's Divine Natural. Their becoming 'an inheritance of his enemies' stands for the fact that it would take the place of those 
things that existed previously in the Natural. Dominion at that time over the truths there is meant by 'he will have dominion over Jacob, and he will destroy what is left of the city' - 'Jacob' being 
the truth of the natural, <a href="3305.htm">3305</a>, and 'a city' doctrine, <a href="402.htm">402</a>, <a href="2268.htm">2268</a>, <a href="2449.htm">2449</a>, <a href="2712.htm">2712</a>, <a href="2943.htm">2943</a>, <a href="3216.htm">3216</a>. Dominion is said to be had over those truths when they are subsidiary to and subject to good. Before this 
comes about they are called enemies because they constantly offer resistance, as shown above in <a href="3321.htm">3321</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Amos, </p>
<blockquote>
On that day I will raise up the tent of David that is fallen down, and I will close 
up their breaches, and I will restore its destroyed places, and I will build it as in the days of old, that they may possess the remnants of Edom, and all the nations which have been called by My 
name. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%209:11,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 9:11, 12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The tent of David' stands for the Church and worship of the Lord; 'the remnants of Edom' for those within the Church who are governed by good, 'the nations which have been called 
by His name' for those outside the Church who are governed by good - 'the nations' being those who are governed by good, <a href="1259.htm">1259</a>, <a href="1260.htm">1260</a>, <a href="1416.htm">1416</a>, <a href="1849.htm">1849</a>. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Upon Edom I will cast my shoe. Who will 
bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me even to Edom? Will not You, O God? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2060:8-10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 60:8-10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Edom' stands for the good of the natural. Its being the good of the natural is evident from the 
meaning of 'shoe' as the lowest part of the natural, <a href="1748.htm">1748</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Daniel, </p>
<blockquote>
At the time of the end the king of the south will clash with him; therefore the king of the north will rush upon him like 
a whirlwind with chariots, and will overflow and penetrate; and when he comes into the glorious land many will fall These however will be delivered out of his hand, Edom and Moab, and the firstfruits 
of the children of Ammon. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%2011:40,%2041&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 11:40, 41</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the final state of the Church. 'The king of the north' stands for falsities, or what amounts to the same, for people in possession of falsities. 
'Edom' stands for those in whom simple good is present, the type of good that exists with those who constitute the Lord's external Church. The same applies to 'Moab' and 'the children of Ammon', <a href="2468.htm">2468</a>; and as the two of them, that is to say, Edom and Moab, mean those in whom natural good exists, both are therefore mentioned together in many places. But the difference between them is that 'Edom' 
is the good of the natural to which matters of doctrine concerning truth have been allied, whereas 'Moab' is natural good such as also exists with those with whom the two have not been joined together. 
Both sets of people seem to outward appearance to be alike, but they are not so inwardly.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 From this it is now evident why it was said that they were not to abhor an Edomite since he was 
a brother, nor an Egyptian since they had been strangers in his land, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2023:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 23:7</a>. Because 'an Edomite' means the good of the natural, and 'an Egyptian' means the truths of the same, which are facts, <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, 
<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>, <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>, therefore the two are mentioned in the good sense. It is also evident why Jehovah told Moses that they were not to quarrel<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> with the children of Esau, for none of their territory 
would be given to the children of Jacob, not even enough to leave a footprint, Deut <a href="2.htm">2</a>. <a href="4.htm">4</a>-<a href="6.htm">6</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 In the contrary sense however Esau and Edom represent those who turn away from good by utterly despising 
truth and who are unwilling to associate any truth of faith at all with it, which happens chiefly for reasons of self-love. Consequently Esau and Edom in the contrary sense mean those people The 
same was also represented by the king of Edom coming out with many people and a strong force and refusing to let Israel pass across his frontier, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2020:14-22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 20:14-22</a>. This evil, that is to say, the evil of 
self-love, which is such as does not accept the truths of faith, nor thus matters of doctrine concerning truth, is described in various places in the Word as Esau and Edom, the state of the Church when 
it comes to be such also being described at the same time; as in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Against Edom. Is there no wisdom any longer in Teman? Has counsel perished from those who have intelligence? Has their 
wisdom become rotten? Flee! They have turned themselves away, they have gone down to dwell in the deep, O inhabitants of Dedan, for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him. I will strip Esau bare, 
I will uncover his secret places, and he is not able to be concealed. His seed have been laid waste, and his brothers, and his neighbours. Leave your orphans, I will keep them alive, and let your widows 
trust in Me. Edom will become a waste; everyone who passes by it will be astonished and will hiss at all its plagues. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2049:7,%208,%2010,%2011,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 49:7, 8, 10, 11, 17</a>, and following verses. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 In David, </p>
<p>They say, Let 
not the name of Israel be remembered any more, for they consult together with one accord; against You they make a covenant - the tents of Edom, and the Ishmaelites, and Moab, and the Hagrites. Ps. 
83:4-6. </p>
<p>In Obadiah, </p>
<p>Thus said the Lord Jehovih to Edom, Behold, I have made you small among the nations; you are utterly despised. The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who dwell in the 
clefts of the rock, whose seat is on high, who say in your heart, Who will bring me down to the ground? Though you exalt yourself like the eagle, and though you set your nest among the stars, from there 
will I bring you down. How are the men of Esau searched out, their hidden treasures sought out! Will I not on that day destroy the wise men out of Edom, and those who have intelligence out of Mount 
Esau, so that your mighty men may be dismayed, O Teman, and every man from Mount Esau cut off by slaughter? For the violence done to Jacob your brother shame will cover you, and you will be cut off for 
ever. The house of Jacob will be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau turned into stubble; and they will burn them and consume them, and there will be nothing left over to 
the house of Esau. And the people of the south will inherit the mountain of Esau. Obad. verses 1-4, 6, 8-10, 18, 19, 21. </p>
<p>'Edom' and 'Esau' here stand for the evil of the natural man, which evil, arising 
out of self-love, despises and rejects all truth - which leads to its devastation. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<p>Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it, and say to it, Thus 
said the Lord Jehovih, I am against you, Mount Seir, and I will stretch out My hand against you, and I will make you a waste and a desolation. Because you possess eternal enmity, and give over the 
children of Israel to the power of the sword<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> in the time of their disaster and in the time of the iniquity of the end. Because you said concerning the two nations and the two lands, They are mine and 
we will inherit them - and Jehovah is there. And you will know that I Jehovah have heard all your insults which you have uttered against the mountains of Israel. You will be a waste, Mount Seir, and 
all Edom. the whole of it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2035:2-5,%208-10,%2012,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 35:2-5, 8-10, 12, 15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here it is quite clear that 'Edom' in the contrary sense is those who despise, reject, and insult spiritual goods and truths, meant by 'the mountains 
of Israel'.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[10]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said the Lord Jehovih, Surely in the fire of My jealousy have I spoken against the remnants of the nations, and against the whole of Edom, who

<p>Here similarly 'giving the land to themselves as an inheritance' stands for 
laying waste the Church, that is, good and truth that are the Church's. </p>

<p><b>[11]</b>
 In Malachi, </p>
<blockquote>
The Word of Jehovah against Israel; I have loved you, said Jehovah, and you say, How have You loved us? 
Is not Esau Jacob's brother? And I love Jacob, and I hate Esau and am making his mountain into a waste. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mal%201:1-3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mal 1:1-3</a>.

<p>Here 'Esau' stands for the evil of the natural which does not accept spiritual 
truth, meant by 'Israel', <a href="3305.htm">3305</a>, or the doctrine of truth, meant by 'Jacob', <a href="3305.htm">3305</a>, and is for that reason 'laid waste', meant by 'hating'. For 'hating' has no other meaning, as is evident from what has 
been introduced above from the Word regarding Esau and Edom in the good sense. But when truth does not allow itself to be allied to good, Jacob is referred to in a contrary way, as in Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
He will 
make a visitation on Jacob over his ways and requite him according to his deeds; in the womb he supplanted his brother. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%2012:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 12:2, 3</a>.

<p>hoc malum, nempe 
amoris sui, quod tale {15}sit ut non admittat vera fidei, ita nec doctrinalia veri, variis in locis in Verbo per `Esavum et Edomum' describitur, et simul status Ecclesiae cum talis fit; ut apud Jeremiam,  
         Contra Edomum,...num nulla amplius sapientia in Temane?      num periit consilium ab intelligentibus? num putida facta est      sapientia eorum? fugite, averterunt se, profundarunt se 
ad      habitandum, habitatores Dedanis, quia calamitatem Esavi      adducam super eum;...Ego denudabo Esavum, revelabo occulta      ejus, et abscondi non possit, devastatum est semen ejus, et   
   fratres ejus, et vicini ejus;...relinque orphanos tuos, Ego      vivificabo, et viduas tuas, super Me confidant;...erit Edomus      in vastitatem, omnis qui transit praeter eam, obstupescet et  
    sibilabit super omnibus plagis ejus, xlix 7, 8, 10, 11, 17      seq.: </p>
<p>[8] apud Davidem,           Dicunt...Non memoretur nomen Israelis amplius, quia      consultant corde una, super te foedus 
{16}pangunt tentoria      Edomi, et Jishmaelitae, et Moabus, et Hagraei, Ps. lxxxiii 5-7      [A.V. 4-6]: </p>
<p>apud Obadiam,           Sic dixit Dominus Jehovih Edomo, Ecce parvum dedi te in      gentibus, 
contemptus tu valde; superbia cordis tui decepit te,      habitans in fissuris petrae, altitudine sedis tuae, qui dicis      in corde tuo, Quis detrahet me in terram? Si exaltaveris te      
sicut aquila, et si inter stellas posueris nidum, inde      detraham te....Quomodo perquisiti Esau, investigata abdita      eorum,...Nonne in die illo perdam sapientes ex Edomo, et      intelligentes 
e monte Esavi? Ut consternentur fortes tui      Teman, et exscindatur vir de monte Esavi a caede. Propter      violentiam fratris tui Jacobi operiet te pudor, et exscinderis      in aeternum,...Erit 
domus Jacobi ignis, et domus Josephi      flamma, et domus Esavi in stipulam, et accendent eos, et      consument eos, et non erit residuum domui Esavi,...et      hereditabunt meridionales montem 
Esavi, (x)1-4, 6, 8-10, 18,      19, 21; </p>
<p>`Edom et Esau' ibi pro malo naturalis hominis ex amore sui oriundo, quod contemnit et rejicit omne verum, unde ejus devastatio: [9] apud Ezechielem,    
       Fili hominis, pone facies tuas contra montem Seir, et      propheta contra illum, et dic illi, Sic dixit Dominus Jehovih,      Ego contra te mons Seir, et extendam manum Meam contra te, et  
    dabo te vastitatem et devastationem,... quia est tibi      inimicitia aeternitatis, et fluere facis filios Israelis super      manus gladii, in tempore interitus eorum, in tempore      iniquitatis 
finis,...quia dixisti de duabus gentibus, et de      duabus terris, Mihi sunt, et hereditabimus eam, et Jehovah ibi      est:     et cognosces quod Ego Jehovah audiverim omnes      contumelias 
tuas, quas dixisti contra montes      Israelis,...vastitas {17}eris mons Seir, et omnis Edom tota,      xxxv 2-5, 8-10, 12, 15;  ibi manifeste patet quod `Edom' in opposito sensu sint illi qui contemnunt, 
rejiciunt et contumeliis afficiunt bona et vera spiritualia, quae sunt `montes Israelis': [10] apud eundem,           Sic dixit Dominus Jehovih, Si non in igne zeli Mei      locutus sim super 
reliquias gentium, et super Edomum totam,      qui dederunt terram Meam sibi in hereditatem cum gaudio omnis      cordis, cum contemptu animae, xxxvi 5; </p>
<p>similiter, `dare terram sibi in hereditatem' 
pro vastare Ecclesiam, {18}hoc est, bonum et verum quae sunt Ecclesiae: [11] apud Malachiam,           Verbum Jehovae contra Israelem, Amavi vos, dixit Jehovah,      et dicitis, In quo amasti nos? 
nonne frater Esau Jacobo? et      amo Jacobum, et Esavum odio habeo, et pono montem ejus      vastitatem, i 1-3; </p>
<p>ibi `Esau' pro malo naturalis quod non admittit verum spirituale quod est `Israel,' 
n. 3305, et doctrinale veri quod est `Jacob,' n. 3305, et propterea vastatur, quod est `odio habere'; quod non aliud sit `odio habere,' patet ab illis quae supra de Esavo et Edomo in bono sensu e Verbo 
allata sunt: cum autem verum non se {19}adjungi patitur bono, tunc de Jacobo vicissim dicitur, ut apud Hosheam,           Ad visitandum super Jacobum vias ejus, secundum opera      ejus retribuet 
ei, in utero supplantavit fratrem suum, xii 3,      4. @1 vera ejusdem$  @2 per influxum$  @3 conjuncta$  @4 at$  @5 degenerant$  @6 suam AI$  @7 ejus AI$  @8 i Ipsius$  @9 dominatur$  @10
