<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2156节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2156.</strong>“我主”表一位里面的三位一体，也就是说，神性本身，神性人和神圣活动 ，这三位一体就在一位里面。这从此处经上提及“主”时用的是单数形式清楚可知。类似情形还有：27，31节：“看哪，求你容我大胆向我主说”；30，32节：“求我主不要动怒”。这三个人还被称为耶和华，如13节：“耶和华对亚伯拉罕说。”14节：“耶和华岂有难成的事吗？”22节：“亚伯拉罕仍旧站在耶和华面前。”33节：“耶和华与亚伯拉罕讲完话就走了”。由此明显可知，这三个人（即神性本身，神性人和神圣活动）和主一样，主和耶和华一样。被称为信经的基督教信仰告白同样承认这一点，信经上明确说明：不是三位非受造者，不是三位无限者，不是三位永恒者，不是三位全能者，乃是一位。没人会将这一位里面的三位一体分裂开来，除了那些声称他们承认一个至高无上的存在，宇宙的创造者之人以外。对教会外的人来说，这样的承认是值得原谅的。但作出相同声明的教会中人则不然，这些人根本不承认任何神，尽管他们这样说，有时这样想。他们更不承认主。</p>

My Lord. That this signifies the Trine in a One, namely, the Divine Itself, the Divine Human, and the Holy proceeding, which Trine is in a One, is evident from its being here said "Lord," in the singular 
number. So too in verses 27, 31, "Behold I pray I have taken upon me to speak unto my Lord," and in verses 30, 32, "Let not I pray my Lord be angry." The three men are also called "Jehovah," in verse 
13, "Jehovah said unto Abraham;" in verse 14, "Shall anything be wonderful for Jehovah?" in verse 22, "Abraham was yet standing before Jehovah;" and in verse 33, "And Jehovah went when He left off 
speaking to Abraham." Hence it is evident that the three men (that is, the Divine Itself, the Divine Human, and the Holy proceeding), are the same as the Lord, and the Lord the same as Jehovah. In the 
Christian Faith, called the Creed, the same is acknowledged, where it is said in plain words, "There are not three Uncreate, nor three Infinite, nor three Eternal, nor three Almighty, nor three Lords, 
but One." There are none who separate this Trine which is in a One except those who say that they acknowledge one Supreme Existence [Ens], the Creator of the Universe; which is forgiven those who 
are outside of the church. But they who are within the church, and say this, although they say it and sometimes think it, do not in fact acknowledge any God; still less do they acknowledge the Lord. </p>

'My Lord' means the Three in One, that is to say, the Divine itself, the Divine Human, and the Holy proceeding; and as the Three exist in One the word 'Lord' in the singular is used, as similarly it 
is used - </p>
<p> In verses 27, 31 'Behold now, I have undertaken to speak to my Lord'.  In verses 30, 32, 'Let not now my Lord be incensed'. </p>
<p>The three men are also called Jehovah -  </p>
<p>In verse 13, Jehovah 
said to Abraham. </p>
<p>In verse 14, 'Will anything to be too wonderful for Jehovah?'  In verse 22, Abraham still stood before Jehovah. In verse 33, And Jehovah departed, when He had finished speaking 
to Abraham. </p>
<p>From these places it is clear that the three men, that is, the Divine itself, the Divine Human, and the Holy proceeding, are one and the same as the Lord, and the Lord one and the 
same as Jehovah. In the statement of Christian faith called the Creed the same is recognized, where it is explicitly stated, </p>
<p>There are not three uncreated, not three infinites, not three eternals, 
not three almighties, not three Lords, but One. </p>
<p>There are none who separate Three that are within a One, apart from those who say that they acknowledge one Supreme Being, the Creator of the Universe. 
Such an acknowledgement is excusable among those outside the Church; but in the case of those inside the Church who declare the same, these do not acknowledge any God at all, though they say and sometimes 
think it. Still less do they acknowledge the Lord. </p>

`Domine mi': quod significet Trinum in Uno, nempe Divinum Ipsum, Humanum Divinum, Sanctum procedens, quod Trinum in Uno est, quare hic dicitur Dominus in singulari; similiter vers. 27, 31, `Ecce quaeso 
suscepi ad loquendum ad Dominum meum {1}': et vers. 30, 32, `Ne quaeso succenseatur Domino meo.'  Tum etiam tres illi {2} viri dicuntur Jehovah: vers. 13, `Dixit Jehovah ad Abraham': vers. 14, `Num 
mirabile erit pro jehovah quicquam?': vers. 22, `Abraham adhuc stans coram Jehovah': vers. 33, `Et ivit Jehovah, quando absolvit loqui ad Abrahamum': inde constat quod tres viri, hoc est, (t)Divinum 
Ipsum, Humanum Divinum et Sanctum procedens sint idem ac Dominus, (c)et Dominus idem ac Jehovah; in Christiana fide, quae Symbolica appellatur, idem agnoscitur ubi haec apertis verbis, `Non tres Increati 
sunt, non tres Infiniti, non tres Aeterni, non tres Omnipotentes, non tres Domini, sed Unus.' Non alii sunt qui separant hoc Trinum quod in Uno, quam qui dicunt se agnoscere unum Ens Supremum, creatorem 
universi, quod ignoscitur illis qui extra Ecclesiam sunt; sed qui ita {3} intra Ecclesiam dicunt, ne quidem agnoscunt aliquem Deum, tametsi id aiunt, et quandoque putant; minus agnoscunt Dominum. 	@1
