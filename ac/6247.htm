<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6247节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6247.</strong>“以法他就是伯利恒”表取而代之的是一种对真理与良善的新情感的状态。这从“伯利恒”的含义清楚可知，“伯利恒”是指处于一种新状态的属天层的属灵层（参看<a href="4594.htm">4594</a>节），因而是指一种对真理与良善的新情感的状态。因为属天层的属灵层是良善之真理，因而是对源于良善的真理之情感。有必要说一说本节在内义上的内容是怎么回事。所论述的主题是弃绝之前对真理的情感，接受一种新的情感。当人正在重生时，之前对真理的情感存在；但一旦他已经重生，后一种情感，即一种新的情感存在。在前一种状态下，此人拥有对真理的情感，因为他想变得聪明；但在后一种状态下，他想变得智慧；或也可说，在前一种状态下，他出于教义而拥有对真理的一种情感；但在后一种状态下，他出于生活而拥有对真理的一种情感。当出于教义时，他从真理看良善；但当出于生活时，他从良善看真理。因此，后一种状态是前一种状态的反转。由于这个原因，当人正在重生时，前一种状态被弃绝，后一种状态，即一种新状态被接受。此外，相对于后一种新状态，前一种状态是不洁的；因为当一个人出于教义为了变得聪明而拥有对真理的一种情感时，他同时也被名声和荣耀所感染。这种情感不可避免地存在于前一种状态，它的存在也是被准许的，以便它能进入下一个状态，因为人就具有这种性质。但当他出于生活而对真理拥有一种情感时，就会弃绝作为他目的的荣耀和名声，转而接受生活的良善，也就是对邻之仁。</p>

The same is Bethlehem. That this signifies in its place a state of new affection of truth and good, is evident from the signification of "Bethlehem," as being the spiritual of the celestial in a new 
state (see n. 4594), thus a state of new affection of truth and good; for the spiritual of the celestial is the truth of good, thus the affection of truth from good. It is necessary to say how the case 
is with the contents of this verse in the internal sense. The subject treated of is the rejection of a former affection of truth, and the reception of a new one. The former affection of truth exists 
while man is being regenerated, but the latter, which is the new one, when he has been regenerated. In the former state the man is affected with truth for the sake of the end that he may become intelligent, 
but in the latter state that he may become wise; or what is the same, in the former state he is affected with truth for the sake of doctrine, but in the latter for the sake of life; when for the 
sake of doctrine, then from truth he looks to good; but when for the sake of life, he from good looks to truth. Thus the latter state is the inverse of the former; and therefore the former state is 
rejected while the man is being regenerated; and the latter, which is a new state, is received. Moreover relatively to the latter new state, the former state is impure; for when a man is affected with 
truth for the sake of doctrine in order that he may become intelligent, he is also at the same time affected with reputation and glory. This affection cannot then but be present, and it is also permitted 
as being introductory, because the man is of such a nature. But when he is affected with truth for the sake of life, he then rejects glory and reputation as ends, and embraces the good of life, 
that is, charity toward the neighbor. </p>

'That is, Bethlehem' means replacing this, a state in which there is a new affection for truth and good. This is clear from the meaning of 'Bethlehem' as the spiritual of the celestial in a new state, 
dealt with in <a href="4594.htm">4594</a>, thus a state in which there is a new affection for truth and good. For the spiritual of the celestial is the truth of good, thus an affection for truth derived from good. The situation 
so far as the contents of this verse in the internal sense are concerned must be stated. What the verse deals with is the casting away of a former affection for truth and the acceptance of a new 
one. The former affection for truth exists while a person is being regenerated, but a subsequent and new one exists once he has become regenerated. In the former state the person has an affection for 
truth because he is intent on becoming intelligent, but in the subsequent state on becoming wise; or what amounts to the same, in the former state he has an affection for truth out of concern for doctrine, 
but in the subsequent state out of concern for life. When it is a concern for doctrine he looks from truth towards good, but when it is a concern for life he looks from good towards truth, so 
that the subsequent state is a reversal of the former. For that reason the former state is cast away while a person is being regenerated, and the subsequent and new one is received. Also, compared with 
the subsequent new state the former one is impure, for when a person has an affection for truth out of concern for doctrine because he is intent on becoming intelligent, he is also moved at the same 
time by a desire for reputation and glory. This desire is inevitably present in that former state, and its presence is allowed so that it may lead on into the next, because that is what people are like. 
But when he has an affection for truth out of concern for life, he casts aside glory and reputation as his ends in view and instead embraces the good of life, that is, charity towards the neighbour. </p>

`Ea Bethlehem': quod significet loco illius, status novae affectionis veri et boni, constat ex significatione `Bethlehem' quod sit spirituale caelestis in statu novo, de qua n. 4594, ita status novae 
affectionis veri et boni; nam spirituale caelestis est verum boni, ita affectio veri ex bono.  Quomodo cum his quae in hoc versu in sensu interno continentur, se habet, dicendum: agitur de rejectione 
prioris affectionis veri et de receptione novae; prior affectio veri est cum regeneratur homo, at posterior quae nova, est cum regeneratus est; in priore statu afficitur homo vero propter finem ut intelligens 
fiat, in posteriore autem statu ut sapiens, seu quod idem in priore statu afficitur vero propter doctrinam, in posteriore autem propter vitam; cum propter doctrinam tunc ex vero spectat bonum, 
at cum propter vitam, ex bono spectat verum; ita est posterior status inversus prioris; quapropter prior status rejicitur cum regeneratur homo, et posterior qui novus, recipitur; prior etiam status 
respective ad posteriorem novum est impurus, nam cum afficitur homo vero propter doctrinam ut intelligens fiat, etiam simul afficitur fama et gloria; haec {1} affectio non potest non tunc adesse, et 
quoque permittitur ut introducat, quia homo talis est; at cum afficitur vero propter vitam, tunc gloriam et famam ut fines, rejicit, et vitae bonum, hoc est, charitatem erga proximum {2} amplectitur. @1
