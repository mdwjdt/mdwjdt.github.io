<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10735节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10735</strong>.在陪同我的这些灵人当中，有一个灵人在世时曾是一个充满激情的传教士和作家。根据我对他的观念，陪同我的灵人以为他心里是一个比其他所有人都伟大的基督徒。因为在世上，人们对一个人的观念的孕育和判断的形成是基于他的说教和他所写的东西，而不是基于他所过的生活，除非这生活是显而易见的。即便看见他生活的某个方面与他所宣扬或所写的不一致，他们仍能原谅；因为对某人的观念，或想法和感知会将一切事物吸引到它自己这一边。</p>

There was also with me a certain spirit who during his life in the world had been a very impassioned preacher and writer. From the idea I had about him the attendant spirits supposed that he was pre-eminently 
a Christian at heart; for in the world an idea is conceived and a judgment is formed from the preaching and from the writings, and not from the life unless this is conspicuous; and if anything 
of an inconsistent life appears, it is nevertheless excused, because the idea (or thought and perception) about anyone draws everything over to its side. </p>

Among those accompanying me there was some spirit who when he had lived in the world had been an extremely passionate preacher and writer. From the idea I had of him the spirits who were my companions 
supposed that he was a greater Christian at heart than all others. For in the world people form an idea of and judge such a person from his preaching and the things he writes, not from the life he leads 
if this is not evident to them. And even if they see that some aspect of his life is out of keeping with what he preaches or writes they nevertheless excuse it; for the idea, or thought and perception, 
regarding someone draws all things favourably onto its own side.  </p>

</p><b>10735.</b>
Quidam spiritus etiam mecum erat qui dum in mundo vixit, praedicator et scriptor valde patheticus {1}fuit; ex idea de illo in me putabant spiritus comites illum fore Christianum corde prae reliquis, 
nam in mundo capitur idea et judicatur ex praedicatione et ex scriptis, et non ex vita si haec non exstat, et si aliquid vitae non concordantis apparet, usque excusatur; nam idea, seu cogitatio et perceptio 
de aliquo, trahit omnia ad sui partes. @1 erat$ </p>
