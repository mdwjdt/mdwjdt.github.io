<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3420节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3420.</strong>“因非利士人在亚伯拉罕死后塞住了”表只有认知的记忆知识之人拒绝承认这些真理。这从“塞住”的含义和“非利士人”的代表清楚可知：“塞住”是指不愿知道，等于拒绝承认、从而抹掉它们（<a href="3412.htm">3412</a>节）；“非利士人”是指那些只有认知的记忆知识之人（<a href="1197.htm">1197</a>，<a href="1198.htm">1198</a>，<a href="3412.htm">3412</a>，<a href="3413.htm">3413</a>节）。那些拥有信之教义事物，却不愿知道为认知或教义事物源头的真理之人就处在认知的记忆知识中。为认知或教义事物源头的真理涉及生活，并且涉及对邻之仁和对主之爱。构成教义事物和知识的宗教教义只是教导这些事，所以凡教导当做什么，自己却不去做的人都不愿知道真理，因为它们与他的生活相冲突。凡违背其生活的事，他也拒绝承认。这些就是为何在古教会构成整个教义的爱与仁的教义事物被抹掉的原因。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3420</b></p><p><b>3420.</b>
And the Philistines stopped them up after the death of Abraham. That this signifies that they who were in the mere memory-knowledge of knowledges denied those truths, is evident from the signification 
of "stopping up," as being not to be willing to know, and what is the same, to deny and thus to obliterate them (concerning which above, n. 3412); and from the representation of the Philistines, as 
being those who are in the mere memory-knowledge of knowledges (concerning which above, n. 1197, 1198, 3412, 3413). Those are in the memory-knowledge of knowledges who are in the doctrinal things of faith 
and are not willing to know the truths of knowledges or of doctrinal things. The truths of knowledges or of doctrinal things are those which are of life, and which have regard to charity toward the 
neighbor and love to the Lord. The doctrine to which these doctrinal things and knowledges pertain, merely teaches them; and therefore the man who teaches what ought to be done, and does not do it, 
is not willing to know truths, because they are contrary to his life; and that which is contrary to his life he also denies. It is from these causes that the doctrinal things of love and charity, which 
in the Ancient Church were the whole of doctrine, are obliterated. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3420</b></p><p><b>3420.</b>
'Which the Philistines had been stopping up after Abraham's death' means that people who had no more than a knowledge of cognitions refused to recognize these truths. This is clear from the meaning of 
'stopping up' as not wishing to know, and what amounts to the same, refusing to recognize and so effacing, dealt with above in <a href="http://swedenborgstudy.org/34122.htm">34122</a>; and from the representation of 'the Philistines' as those who have 
no more than a knowledge of cognitions, dealt with in <a href="1197.htm">1197</a>, <a href="1198.htm">1198</a>, <a href="3412.htm">3412</a>, <a href="3413.htm">3413</a>. It is the knowledge of cognitions that those ruled by matters of doctrine concerning faith possess, and they have no wish 
to know the truths that are the sources of cognitions or matters of doctrine. The truths that are the sources of cognitions or matters of doctrine are those that have to do with life and that have 
regard to charity towards the neighbour and love to the Lord. Religious teaching, which consists of matters of doctrine and of recognized facts, does no more than teach those things. Anyone therefore 
who teaches what ought to be done, but does not do it himself, does not wish to know truths since they run counter to his life. And things contrary to his life he also refuses to recognize. These are 
the reasons why the matters of doctrine concerning love and charity which in the Ancient Church constituted the whole of religious teaching have been effaced. </p>

</p><b>3420.</b>
Quod `obturabant illos Philistaei post mortem Abrahami' significet quod qui in sola scientia cognitionum illa negarent, constat a significatione `obturare' quod sit non scire velle, et quod idem, negare, 
sic obliterare, de qua supra n. 3412; et ex repraesentatione `Philistaeorum' quod sint illi qui in sola scientia cognitionum, de qua n. 1197, 1198, 3412, 3413. In scientia cognitionum sunt illi 
qui in doctrinalibus fidei, et vera cognitionum seu doctrinalium non scire volunt; vera cognitionum seu doctrinalium sunt illa quae sunt vitae, et spectant charitatem erga proximum et amorem in Dominum, 
doctrina cujus sunt doctrinalia et cognitiones, modo docet illa; qui itaque docet quid faciendum, et non facit, vera non scire vult, nam contra ipsius vitam sunt, et quae contra vitam, illa quoque 
negat; ex illis est quod doctrinalia amoris et charitatis quae in Antiqua Ecclesia erant omne doctrinae, obliterata sint. </p>
