<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5696节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5696.</strong>“出来”表通过移走。这从“出来”的含义清楚可知，“出来”在此是指移走；因为将自己移走的人就出去，或离开别人。包含在内义中的情形是这样：“约瑟”在至高意义上代表主；对正在重生的人来说，“以色列的十个儿子”代表属世层中的真理与良善；而“便雅悯”代表居间层。之所以向居间层显示出于爱的怜悯，是因为这就是在下面，即在属世层里面的事物藉以重生的手段。不过，在联结通过居间层实现之前，主的爱与怜悯不会显现或看不见。采取措施也是为了防止它们显现或被看见；因为如果它们显现，或被看见，重生是不可能实现的。这些措施包括离开和隐藏；不是说主会移走或隐藏祂的怜悯；而是说当正在重生的人被引入他的邪恶时，在他看来好像是主远离并隐藏起来；正是这些邪恶挡在中间，是造成这种表象的原因，就像乌云挡在我们和太阳之间，使这太阳看似远离他，向他隐藏。这就是此处所指的隐藏和移走。</p>

And went out. That this signifies by removal, is evident from the signification of "going out," as here being removal; for one who removes himself goes out or withdraws from another. The case in the 
internal sense is this. By Joseph in the supreme sense is represented the Lord; by the ten sons of Israel are represented the truths and goods in the natural with those who are being regenerated; and 
by Benjamin is represented the intermediate. There is mercy from love toward the intermediate because thereby the things beneath are regenerated. But the Lord's love and mercy do not appear until conjunction 
through the intermediate has been effected. It is also so arranged that they do not appear; for should they appear, regeneration could not be effected. This arrangement is made by removal and 
concealment-not that the Lord ever removes or conceals mercy; but when one who is being regenerated is let into his evils, it appears to him as if the Lord were remote and hidden. It is the evils that 
interpose and have this effect, just as dense clouds interpose between us and the sun, and make it seem distant and hide it. This is the concealment and removal that are meant. </p>

'And went out' means by means of a removal. This is clear from the meaning here of 'going out' as a removal; for one who removes himself goes out or departs from another. The matter contained in the 
internal sense is as follows: 'Joseph' in the highest sense represents the Lord; 'the ten sons of Israel' represents the truths and the forms of good present in the natural in the case of those who are 
being regenerated; while 'Benjamin' is the intermediary. Mercy springing out of love is shown towards the intermediary because this is the means by which what is below, that is, in the natural, is regenerated. 
But the Lord's love and mercy remain unseen until the joining together has been effected by means of the intermediary. Steps are also taken to prevent their being seen; for if they did come 
to be seen no regeneration would be possible. Those steps involve removal and concealment. Not that the Lord ever removes or conceals His mercy; but when the evils present in one who is being regenerated 
are brought to the fore it appears to that person as though the Lord has been removed and is concealed from him; for those evils stand in the way and are responsible for that appearance. One may 
compare what they do to dark clouds which stand between him and the sun, causing this to be absent and concealed from him. It is that kind of concealment and removal that is meant here.  </p>

`Et exivit':  quod significet per remotionem, constat ex significatione `exire' quod hic sit remotio, nam qui se removet, exit seu recedit ab altero.  Res ita in sensu interno se habet; per `Josephum' 
in sensu supremo repraesentatur Dominus, per `decem filios Israelis' vera et bona in naturali apud illos qui regenerantur, per `Benjaminem' autem medium; misericordia ex amore est erga medium quia 
per illud regenerantur illa quae infra sunt {1}; sed Domini amor et misericordia non apparet antequam per medium conjunctio facta est; disponitur etiam ita ut non appareat, si enim appareret, non regeneratio 
fieri posset; dispositio fit per remotionem et occultationem, non quod Dominus unquam misericordiam removeat aut occultet, sed cum is qui {2}regeneratur, immittitur in sua mala, tunc apparet ei 
(t)Dominus sicut remotus {3} et occultatus; sunt mala quae se interponunt et id faciunt; sicut comparative densae nubes quae se {4}sistunt inter solem et sistunt absentiam ejus (c)ac illum occultant; 
haec occultatio et remotio est quae intelligitur. @1 i seu in naturali$ @2 regenerabitur$ @3 i sit$ @4 ponunt$ </p>
