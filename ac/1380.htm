<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1380节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1380.</strong>在来世，地方、地方的变化、距离都是一种幻觉。这一点通过以下事实被证明：凭借幻觉，灵人们能立时被提升高处，甚至极高处，同时也能立时被带入下面的深渊，仿佛从宇宙的一极到了另一极。事实上，在来世，女巫和术士凭幻觉引诱其他人相信他们能同时在两个地方，甚至数个地方，以此制造他们无处不在的假象。在世时渴慕高位的人，以及那些骗人的人经常显现在头顶上，而事实上，他们在脚下的地狱中；一旦拿走他们的傲慢自大，他们就会沉入自己的地狱，正如在我面前曾展示的那样。这不是表象，而是一种幻觉，因为如前所述，地方的变化分为两种：一种是一切灵人和天使一直保持在自己的位置上，这是一种表象；另一种是灵人们出现在一个地方，而他们真实的位置并不在那里，这是一种幻觉。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1380.</strong> Location, change of location, and distance in the other life are illusory too, as I was able to see by this fact: In fantasy, spirits can instantly be swept up high — extremely high — and in the same moment down low. They can also be carried seemingly from one end of the universe to the other. In fact witches and warlocks in the other world can use fantasy to trick you into believing they are in one place and at the same time in another too, or even in many places. They pretend to be everywhere at once.<br />People who were ambitious during bodily life and people who were deceitful often appear overhead, and yet they are in a hell under the feet. As soon as they are stripped of their conceit, they tumble into their hell, as I was shown.<br />This is not a manifestation but an illusion. As noted [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1380/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1376" target=_top>1376-1377</a>], there are two kinds of change in location: the way all spirits and angels have of keeping to their place at all times is a visible manifestation, while their habit of showing up in a place when it is not their proper place is an illusion.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg has reported (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1380/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1276" target=_top>1276</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1380/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1377" target=_top>1377</a>) that spirits never change place in the other world, so it is difficult to understand why he now describes this remaining in place as a "change in location." He is probably referring loosely to "keeping to their place" as a category of changing place, that is, of "being in place or not." It is worth noting that though the example of an illusory "change of location" offered here is that of evil spirits appearing overhead, it would apply equally to the simple movement of good spirits from one place to another. For example, if an angel seems to descend from heaven to chastise evil spirits, that is only an illusion — the angel in actuality remains unmoving in his or her own proper place in the order of heaven, and the chastisement takes place at an illusory remove. Likewise in the next section: there it is only the state of certain spirits that changes, though they seem to be in different places at different times. [SS] </p>

That in the other life place, change of place, and distance are a fallacy, has been evidenced by the fact that spirits can by phantasy be carried up on high in a moment, even to a very great height, 
and can also at the same moment be carried into the depths below; and also as it were from one end of the universe to the other. Nay, the sorceresses and magicians there, can by phantasies induce others 
to believe that when they are in one place they are also at the same time in another, even in several places, thus counterfeiting as it were a universal presence. They who in the life of the body have 
aspired to exalted station, and also those who have been deceitful, often appear above the head, while really they are in a hell under the feet; and as soon as their soaring arrogance is taken away, 
they sink down into their own hell, as has been shown me. Their appearance on high is not an appearance, but a fallacy; for, as already said, there are two kinds of mutation of place; that arising 
from all spirits and angels keeping constantly in their own situation, being an appearance; and their appearing in one place when their real situation is not there, being a fallacy. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1380</b></p><p><b>1380.</b>
The fact that place, change of place, and distance in the next life are also an illusion has been made clear to me from the consideration that by means of delusions spirits can in an instant be taken 
up on high, as high as possible, and in the same instant taken into the depths, as well as being taken, so to speak, from one end of the universe to the other. Indeed by means of delusions witches and 
magicians in the next life induce others to believe that when they are in one place they are also simultaneously in another, or even in many places. In this way they pretend to be present everywhere. 
People who have aspired to great heights during their lifetime, as well as people who were deceivers, often appear overhead. Yet they are still in hell underfoot. As soon as their arrogance is taken 
away from them they sink down into their own hell, as I have been shown. This is not an appearance but an illusion, for, as has been stated, there are two types of changes of place - the first being 
that in which every spirit and angel remains all the time in his own position, which is an appearance; and the second being that in which each appears in a place which is not his actual position, which 
is an illusion. </p>

</p><b>1380.</b>
Quod locus, mutatio loci, et distantia in altera vita quoque sit fallacia, constare potuit ex eo quod spiritus per phantasias momento possint transferri in altum, immo in altissimum, etiam eodem momento 
in profundum, ut et quasi ab uno fine universi ad alterum; immo praestigiatrices et magici in altera vita per phantasias inducunt aliis credere quod cum in uno loco, simul etiam in alio sint, etiam 
in pluribus, sic mentiendo quasi praesentiam ubivis: qui alta spirarunt in vita corporis ut et qui dolosi fuerunt, apparent saepe supra caput, sed usque sunt in inferno sub pedibus; ut primum iis adimitur 
fastus, delabuntur in infernum suum, quod nihil ostensum: hoc non est apparentia sed est fallacia, nam, ut dictum, sunt binae species mutationum loci; quod nempe omnes spiritus et angeli constanter 
situm suum teneant, est apparentia; et quod appareant in uno loco, et non ibi eorum situs, est fallacia. </p>
