<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2802节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2803.</strong>“以撒对他父亲亚伯拉罕说话；他说，我父啊；亚伯拉罕说，我儿，我在这里”表神圣真理与神圣良善基于爱在主里面所进行的交谈。这从“儿以撒”和“父亚伯拉罕”的含义，以及这些话所包含的情感清楚可知：“儿以撒”是指神圣真理；“父亚伯拉罕”是指神圣良善，这二者稍后会有论述；这些话所包含的情感来自双方的爱。由此明显可知，这是主与祂父的交谈。还有更多奥秘隐藏在这些话里面，超乎人类想象。这一点从以下事实明显看出来：“说”这个动词在本节出现了四次。在圣言中，当开始引入某个新事物时，通常会出现“说”（to say）和“他说”（he said）这样的词（参看<a href="2061.htm">2061</a>，<a href="2238.htm">2238</a>，<a href="2260.htm">2260</a>节）。这一点还可从这一事实明显看出来：这些话是爱的表达，当这种话被通晓至内在意义的属天天使所觉察时，他们会通过这些话为自己形成最为属天的观念。因为他们通过圣言里的情感为自己形成开明的观念，而属灵天使则通过这些话和这些事的含义为自己形成观念（<a href="2157.htm">2157</a>，<a href="2275.htm">2275</a>节）。这些话里有四个明显不同的阶段和爱之情感，属天天使通过这些话形成诸如绝无可能降至人类理解范畴，也不可能用言语表达出来的那类观念。这些观念的形成过程具有无法形容的丰富性和多样化。由此可见，圣言就其内义而言是何性质，哪怕从字面上看，它在有些地方，如本节，看似简简单单。</p>

Isaac said unto Abraham his father; and he said, My father; and he said, Here am I, my son. That this signifies the Lord conference from love - of the Divine Truth with the Divine Good-is evident from 
the signification of "Isaac the son," as being the Divine Truth; and from the signification of "Abraham the father," as being the Divine Good; which are treated of in what presently follows; and from 
the affection that is in these words, as being from love on both sides. Hence it is manifest that it is a conference of the Lord with His Father. That more arcana lie hid in these words than can come 
to human perception, is evident from the fact that the words "he said" occur four times in this verse. It is usual in the Word, when any new thing is begun, to say, "and he said" (see n. 2061, 2238, 
2260). The same is evident from the fact that the words are words of love; and when such come to the perception of the celestial angels who are in the inmost sense, they form for themselves from them 
most celestial ideas; for they form for themselves luminous ideas from the affections in the Word, whereas the spiritual angels do so from the significations of the words and of the things (n. 2157, 
2275); and thus from these words, in which there are four distinct periods and affections of love, the celestial angels form such things as can in no wise come down to human apprehension, nor can be put 
into words; and this with ineffable abundance and variety. Hence we can see what the quality of the Word is in its internal sense, even where it appears simple in the letter, as in this verse. </p>

'Isaac said to Abraham his father - he said - My father. And he said, Here I am, my son' means a conversing - which took place in the Lord and was grounded in love - between Divine Truth and Divine Good. 
This is clear from the meaning of 'Isaac', the son, as Divine Truth, and from the meaning of 'Abraham', the father, as Divine Good, both of which are dealt with in the paragraph following this; and 
from the affectional content of these expressions showing that both are grounded in love. From this it is evident that a conversing of the Lord with His Father is meant. Within these words more arcana 
lie concealed than can be perceived by any human mind, as may be recognized from the fact that the verb 'said' occurs four times in this verse (in the Word when something new is being introduced, 
the expression 'end said' is in the habit of appearing, see <a href="2061.htm">2061</a>, <a href="2238.htm">2238</a>, <a href="2260.htm">2260</a>) and also from the fact that the words in this verse are expressive of love, which, when they come to be perceived by celestial 
angels who understand the inmost sense, are formed by those angels into utterly heavenly ideas. For celestial angels form for themselves enlightened ideas from the affectional content of the Word, 
whereas spiritual angels do so from the spiritual meanings of the words and the subject matter there, <a href="2157.htm">2157</a>, <a href="2275.htm">2275</a>. Thus from the words of this verse in which there are four distinct and separate phases 
and affections springing from love, they form ideas such as cannot possibly come down within man's range of understanding nor find expression in words; and that formation of ideas is effected with 
an abundance and variety beyond words. All this shows the nature of the Word in its internal sense, even in places, like the present verse, where it appears plain and simple in the letter. </p>

`Dixit Jishak ad Abraham patrem suum, et dixit, Pater mi; et dixit, Ecce ego fili mi': quod significet collocutionem Domini ex amore Divini Veri cum Divino Bono, constat ex significatione `Jishaki filii' 
quod sit Divinum Verum, et ex significatione `Abrahami patris' quod sit Divinum Bonum, de quibus mox sequitur; et ex affectione quae in his verbis, quod sit utrinque ex amore; inde patet quod sit 
collocutio Domini cum Patre Ipsius:  quod in his verbis plura arcana lateant quam quae ad humanam perceptionem venire possint, constare potest ex eo quod `dixit' quater in hoc versu recurrat; usitatum 
est in Verbo cum novum quid incohatur, {1} quod dicatur `et dixit,' videatur n. 2061, 2238, 2260; tum ex eo quod verba sint amoris, quae cum ad caelestium angelorum qui in sensu intimo sunt, perceptionem 
veniunt, caelestissimas ideas inde sibi formant; illi enim ex affectionibus in Verbo formant sibi idearum luces, at angeli spirituales ex vocum et rerum significationibus, n. 2157, 2275, ita ex 
his, ubi quatuor distinctae periodi et affectiones amoris, talia quae nusquam ad captum humanum descendere, nec in voces dari, possunt et hoc copia et varietate ineffabili; inde constare potest quale 
est Verbum in sensu suo interno, etiam ubi in littera sicut simplex apparet, ut in hoc versu.      @1 inchoat$ </p>
