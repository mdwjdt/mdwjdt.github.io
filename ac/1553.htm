And he went on his journeys, from the south all the way to Bethel, all the way to the place where his tent had been at the start, between Bethel and Ai.<br />He went on his journeys means according to plan. From the south all the way to Bethel means from the light of understanding into the light of wisdom. All the way to the place where his tent had been before means to the holy traits that existed before he became steeped in knowledge. Between Bethel and Ai here as before symbolizes heavenly and worldly categories of knowledge. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1553</b></p><p><b>1553.</b>
Verse 3. And he went according to his journeys, from the south and even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent was at the first, between Bethel and Ai. "He went according to his journeys," signifies 
according to order; "from the south and even to Bethel," signifies from the light of intelligence into the light of wisdom; "unto the place where his tent was before," signifies to the holy things which 
there were before He was imbued with knowledges; "between Bethel and Ai," signifies here, as before, the celestial things of knowledges, and worldly things. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1553</b></p><p><b>1553.</b>
Verse 3 And he went in accordance with his journeys from the south and even to Bethel, even to the place where his tent had been at the start, between Bethel and Ai. </p>
<p>'He went in accordance with his 
journeys' means as accorded with order. 'From the south and even to Bethel' means from the light of intelligence into the light of wisdom. 'Even to the place where his tent had been before' means towards 
the holy things which were there before He had been endowed with cognitions. 'Between Bethel and Ai' means here, as previously, the celestial and the worldly aspects of cognitions. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1553</b>
</p><b>1553.</b>
Vers. 3.  Et ivit secundum itinera sua, a meridie et usque Bethelem, usque ad locum, ubi fuit tentorium illis in initio, inter Bethel et inter Ai. 'Ivit secundum itinera sua' significat secundum ordinem: 
'a meridie et usque Bethelem' significat a luce intelligentiae in lucem sapientiae: 'usque ad locum ubi fuit tentorium illius prius' significat ad sancta quae fuerunt antequam cognitionibus imbutus: 
'inter Bethel et inter Ai' significat, hic ut prius, caelestia cognitionum et mundana. </p>
