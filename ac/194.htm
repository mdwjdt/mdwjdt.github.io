<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">（三）内义</h4><br /><strong>194.</strong>创世记3:1 耶和华神所造的，惟有蛇比田间一切的活物更狡猾。蛇对女人说，神岂是真说，不许你们吃园中所有的树吗？<br />在此，“蛇”表人所认为可靠的感官，“田间的活物”表外在的情绪，和前面一样。“女人”表人的自我。蛇说：“神岂是真说，不许你们吃园中所有的树吗？”表示人开始怀疑。<br />当前论述的是上古教会的第三代，他们开始怀疑先前的启示，除非是看得见摸得着的。本节和下一节描述的是他们的第一个阶段，尚是怀疑的阶段。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]194.</strong> Inner Meaning<br /><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_194/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_1" target=_top>GENESIS 3:1</a>. And the snake was crafty above every wild animal of the field that Jehovah God had made; and it said to the woman, "Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree of the garden'?"<br />The snake is used here to mean our senses, which we trust.{*1} The wild animal of the field, here as before [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_194/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_46" target=_top>46</a>], means every emotion in our outer self. The woman means selfhood. The snake's words — "Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree'?" — mean that for the first time they had doubts.<br />The subject is the third generation of the earliest church, who began to disbelieve what had been revealed unless they could see and feel that it was so. This verse and another just below depict the first phase they went through as a skeptical one.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} In some Christian traditions, the Fall has been equated with enslavement to sensory perception. The Orthodox theologian Maximus the Confessor (580-662) observes, "If a man exercises only sensory discrimination between pain and pleasure in the body, thus transgressing the divine commandment, he eats from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, that is to say, he succumbs to the mindless impulses that pertain to the senses" (Philokalia 1979-1984; 2:149). Swedenborg's emphasis is slightly different from that of theologians like Maximus. He understands the Fall more in cognitive terms (that is, as a belief in the evidence of the senses), rather than in merely physical terms (as a surrender to the distractions of pleasure and pain).

THE INTERNAL SENSE. Verse 1. And the serpent was more subtle than any wild animal of the field which Jehovah God had made; and he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree 
of the garden? By the "serpent" is here meant the sensuous part of man in which he trusts; by the "wild animal of the field" here, as before, every affection of the external man; by the "woman" man's 
Own; by the serpent's saying, "Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree?" that they began to doubt. The subject here treated of is the third posterity of the Most Ancient Church, which began 
not to believe in things revealed unless they saw and felt that they were so. Their first state, that it was one of doubt, is described in this and in the next following verse. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE  Verse I And the serpent was subtle, more than every wild animal of the field that Jehovah God had made. And it said to the woman, Has God indeed said, You shall not eat of every 
tree of the garden?  </p>
<p>'The serpent is here used to mean man's sensory perception in which he trusts. 'Wild animal of the field' here, as previously, means every affection that belongs to the external 
man. 'Woman' means the proprium. 'The serpent said, Has God indeed said, You shall not eat of every tree' means that for the first time they entertained doubts. The subject is the third generation of 
the descendants of the Most Ancient Church, which began not to believe matters of revelation unless they could see the import of these with their eyes and apprehend them with the senses. Their first 
state is described in this verse and the next as being a state of doubting.  </p>

SENSUS INTERNUS 	 Vers. I.  Et serpens fuit astutus prae omni fera agri, quam fecit Jehovah Deus; et dixit ad mulierem, Etiamne dixit Deus, Non comedetis de omni arbore horti? 
 Per 'serpentem' intelligitur hic sensuale hominis cui fiditur: per 'feram agri' hic, ut prius, omnis affectio externi hominis; per 'mulierem' proprium: quod 'serpens dixerit, Etiamne dixit Deus, Non 
comedetis de omni arbore' significat quod dubitaverint primum. Agitur de tertia posteritate Ecclesiae Antiquissimae, quae incepit non credere revelatis nisi viderent et sentirent quod ita se haberent; 
status primus eorum describitur in hoc et in mox sequente versu, quod esset dubitativus. </p>
