<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3475节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3475.</strong>我们已经数次阐述并说明，诸如隐藏在圣言中的那类代表在天上一个接一个地不断出现。这些代表具有这样的性质，灵人和天使能在远比世间正午之光还要清晰的光中看到它们。它们还具有这样的性质，当看到取了外在形式的所有这些事物时，灵人和天使能感知到它们在内在形式上表示什么，甚至能感知到其中更为内在的事物。因为天堂分为三层：在一层天，这些代表以外在形式显现，天使能感知到它们在内在形式上表示什么；在二层天，它们以诸如内在形式上的样子显现，天使能感知到它们在更内在形式上的样子；在三层天，它们以还要内在的形式，也就是至内在的形式显现。一层天所看到的代表是二层天所看到的那些事物的一般代表；而这些代表又是三层天所看到的那些事物的一般代表。因此，一层天所看到的事物含有二层天所看到的事物在里面；二层天所看到的事物含有三层天所看到的事物在里面。由于它们就这样照着层级显现，故由此可见至内在天堂中的代表何等完美，充满智慧，同时又何等有福，并且它们完全无法形容。因为数以百万记的代表只呈现为一个整体代表的单单一个细节。每一个代表都包含诸如本质上属于主国度的那类事物，而这些事物又包含那些本质上属于主自己的事物。一层天的居民在其代表中看到诸如显现在该国度内在领域中的那类事物；并且在这些事物中又看到诸如显现在更为内在的领域中的那类事物；因而看到主的代表，只是很遥远。二层天的居民在其代表中看到诸如存在于该国度至内在领域中的那类事物，又在这些事物中更近地看到主的代表。而三层天的居民则看到主自己。</p>

That in the heavens there come forth continual representatives such as are in the Word, has already been several times stated and shown. These representatives are of such a nature that spirits and angels 
see them in a much clearer light than that of this world at noonday; and they are also of such a nature that when seen in their external form the spirits and angels perceive what they signify in 
their internal form; and therein things still more interior. For there are three heavens: in the first heaven these representatives appear in an external form, with a perception of what they signify in 
the internal form; in the second heaven they appear such as they are in their internal form, with a perception of what they are in a more interior form; in the third heaven they appear in this more 
interior form, which is their inmost form.  The representatives that appear in the first heaven are the generals of those things which appear in the second; and these are the generals of those which 
appear in the third; thus within those which appear in the first heaven are those which appear in the second; and within these are those which appear in the third. And as they are thus presented according 
to degrees, it may be seen how perfect and full of wisdom, and at the same time how happy, are the representatives in the inmost heaven; and that they are utterly unspeakable; for myriads of myriads 
of them present only one single particular of the general representative. In both general and particular these representatives involve such things as are of the Lord's kingdom; and these such as are 
of the Lord Himself. They who are in the first heaven, in their representatives see such things as come forth in the interior sphere of that kingdom; and within these such things as come forth in the 
sphere still more interior; and thus see representatives of the Lord, but remotely. They who are in the second heaven, in their representatives see such things as come forth in the inmost sphere of 
that kingdom, and within these see representatives of the Lord more nearly. But they who are in the third heaven see the Lord Himself. </p>

It has been stated and shown several times already that in heaven representatives like those contained in the Word are manifesting themselves constantly one after another. These representatives are such 
that spirits and angels see them in light far clearer than the light which shines in the world at midday. Indeed these representatives in heaven are such that all the things seen by the angels which 
take an outward form are also perceived by them as to the meaning which those same things carry in their inward form. And they also hold further things that are even more internal. For there are three 
heavens. In the first heaven an angel sees these representatives in the outward form they take, and at the same time he has a perception of the meaning which they possess in their inward form. In 
the second heaven an angel sees them as they exist in their inward form, and at the same time he has a perception of what they are in the form that is even more internal In the third heaven an angel sees 
them as they exist in that even more internal form, which is the inmost. Things seen in the first heaven are general representations of the things seen in the second heaven; while these in turn are 
general representations of those seen in the third. Thus things seen in the first heaven hold within themselves those seen in the second; and those seen in the second hold within themselves those seen 
in the third. And since they manifest themselves by degrees as described it may be evident how perfect, how full of wisdom, and at the same time how blessed, those things are which are seen in the 
inmost heaven, and that they are utterly indescribable. For millions upon millions manifest themselves in one particular feature of a whole representation. Every single one of those representatives embodies 
such things as belong essentially to the Lord's kingdom, while these in turn embody those that belong essentially to the Lord Himself. Inhabitants of the first heaven see within their representatives 
such things as manifest themselves within the inner sphere of the kingdom. And within these they see things more interior still, and so, though remotely, things that are representative of the Lord. 
Inhabitants of the second heaven see within their representatives such things as exist in the inmost sphere of the kingdom; and within these they see representatives of the Lord more closely. Inhabitants 
of the third heaven however see the Lord Himself. </p>

Quod in caelis continua repraesentativa existant qualia sunt in Verbo, aliquoties prius dictum et ostensum est; repraesentativa illa sunt talia ut spiritus et angeli illa in multo clariore luce videant 
quam quae est meridiana mundi; repraesentativa {1}illa sunt talia quod quae vident in externa forma, percipiant quid significant in interna, et in his adhuc interiora: sunt enim tres caeli; in primo 
caelo apparent illa in forma externa cum perceptione quid significant in interna; in {2}secundo caelo apparent illa quia sunt in interna forma cum perceptione qualia sunt in adhuc interiore; in tertio 
caelo apparent illa in forma illa adhuc interiore, quae est intima: quae in primo caelo apparent, sunt communia illarum rerum quae apparent in secundo, et haec communia illarum quae in tertio; ita 
in illis quae apparent in primo caelo, sunt intus illa quae in secundo, et in his intus illa quae in tertio; et quia ita secundum gradus sistuntur, constare potest quam perfecta, sapientia plena, et 
simul quam felicia, sunt illa quae in intimo caelo, et quod prorsus ineffabilia sint, nam myriades myriadum sistant unum particulare {3}communis.  Omnia et singula illa repraesentativa involvunt talia 
quae sunt regni Domini, et haec talia quae sunt Ipsius Domini; qui in primo caelo sunt, in suis repraesentativis vident {4}talia quae in interiore sphaera regni existunt, et in illis quae in adhuc interiore, 
et sic repraesentativa Domini, sed remote; qui in altero caelo sunt, in suis repraesentativis vident talia quae in intima sphaera regni, et in illis repraesentativa Domini propius; qui autem 
in tertio, vident Ipsum Dominum. @1 ibi$  @2 altero$  @3 in communi$  @4 i quae sunt$  </p>
