<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2589节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">出生于教会之外的各个民族和人民在来世的状态和命运</h4><br />2589.一个常见的观点是：那些出生于教会之外、被称为异教徒和外邦人的人无法得救，因为他们没有圣言，因而不认识主，而没有主就没有救恩。但外邦人也能得救，这一点单单从以下考虑就能得知：主的怜悯是普世的，也就是说，针对每一个人。外邦人同样生而为人，和那些相对较少的教会中人一样平等；不认识主并非他们的过错。所以，蒙主怜悯，他们在来世的状态和命运向我显明了。</p>

CONCERNING THE STATE AND LOT IN THE OTHER LIFE OF THE NATIONS AND PEOPLES BORN OUTSIDE OF THE CHURCH. </p>
<p>It is the common opinion that they who are born out of the church, and who are called Pagans and 
Gentiles, cannot be saved, because they have not the Word, and thus are ignorant of the Lord, without whom there is no salvation. But that these also are saved, may be known from the following considerations: 
that the Lord's mercy is universal, that is, toward everyone; that these are born men equally with those who are within the church, who are comparatively few; and that it is not their fault 
that they are ignorant of the Lord. Consequently, their state and lot in the other life, have of the Lord's Divine mercy been shown me. </p>

THE STATE AND CONDITION IN THE NEXT LIFE OF NATIONS AND PEOPLES BORN OUTSIDE THE CHURCH </p>
<p>It is commonly supposed that those born outside the Church, who are called heathens and gentiles, cannot be 
saved for the reason that they do not possess the Word and so do not know the Lord, without whom there is no salvation. But that gentiles too are saved may be known from the single consideration that 
the Lord's mercy is universal - that is, it reaches out to every individual human being. For gentiles are born human beings the same as those within the Church, who are a relative minority; and they are 
not to blame because they do not know the Lord. Consequently the nature of their state and condition in the next life has in the Lord's Divine mercy been shown to me. </p>

</p><b>2589.</b>
De Gentium et Populorum qui extra Ecclesiam nati sunt, statu et sorte in altera vita </p>
<p>Communis opinio est quod illi qui extra Ecclesiam nati sunt, qui ethnici et gentiles vocantur, non possint salvari, 
ex causa quia non habent Verbum, ac ita ignorant Dominum, absque Quo nulla salus: sed usque ex illo solo sciri potest quod illi quoque salventur, quia Domini Misericordia est universalis, hoc est, 
erga singulos; quod illi aeque nascantur homines sicut qui intra Ecclesiam, qui pauci sunt respective; quodque eorum culpa non sit quod ignorent Dominum: qualis itaque eorum status et sors est in altera 
vita, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, mihi ostensum est. </p>
