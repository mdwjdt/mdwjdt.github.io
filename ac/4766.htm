<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4766节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4766.</strong>“我往哪里去才好呢”表现在教会在哪里呢？这从“流便”的代表清楚可知，“流便”是指总体上教会的信仰（<a href="4731.htm">4731</a>，<a href="4734.htm">4734</a>，<a href="4761.htm">4761</a>节）。由于流便指着自己说：“我往哪里去才好呢？”故意思是，现在教会的信仰在哪里呢？或也可说，现在教会在哪里呢？因为没有天上约瑟，也就是没有主的神性真理的地方，没有教会。教会尤其不存在于主的人身是神性这个神性真理，以及仁爱，因而仁爱行为是教会的本质要素这个真理不存在的地方，这一点从本章关于这些两个真理的说明可以看出来。<br />如果主的人身是神性这个神性真理不被接受，那么必可推知，一个三位一体，而不是一个实体将被敬拜；主的一半，也就是祂的神性，而不是祂的人身将被敬拜；因为谁会敬拜非神性之物呢？当敬拜一个三位一体，这三位当中的每一位彼此分离时，或也可说，当这三位得到同样的敬拜时，教会成了什么了？因为尽管这三位被称为一位，但思维仍使他们分开，并将他们一分为三，只是口头上声称一位。让每个人问问自己，当他说，他承认并相信一位神时，他是不是想到三位。或当他声称，父是神，子是神，圣灵也是神，并且这些既在位格上，也在其功能上不同和分离时，他若不以彼此不同的三者通过和谐一致构成一体，以及通过一个从另一个发出的屈就的方式，能否想到存在一位神。因此，当敬拜三位神时，教会在哪里呢？<br />但是，唯独敬拜主，主里面有一个完美的三位一体，祂在父里面，父在祂里面，如祂自己在以下经文所说的：<br />你们纵然不信我，也当信这些事，叫你们又知道又明白：父在我里面，我也在父里面。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.38.htm">10:38</a>）<br />人看见了我，就是看见了父；我在父里面，父在我里面，腓利你不信吗？你们当信我，我在父里面，父在我里面。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.9.htm">14:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.11.htm">11</a>）<br />人看见我，就是看见那差我来的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.45.htm">12:45</a>）<br />凡是我的都是你的，你的也是我的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.10.htm">17:10</a>）<br />这时，基督教会就存在了，如当教会持守主所说的下面这些话时的情形：<br />所有诫命中第一要紧的就是，以色列啊，你要听！主我们神是独一的主。你要尽心、尽性、尽意、尽力爱主你的神，这是第一条诫命。第二条也相仿，就是这一条，要爱邻如己；再没有比这两条诫命更大的了。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.29.htm">12:29</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.31.htm">31</a>）<br />“主我们神”就是主（参看马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太4.7.htm">4:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太4.10.htm">10</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.41.htm">22:41</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.45.htm">45</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.16.htm">1:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.17.htm">17</a>；约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约20.28.htm">20:28</a>），旧约的“耶和华”在新约被称作“主”（参看<a href="2921.htm">2921</a>节）。<br />如果这一神性真理（即对邻之爱，也就是仁爱，因而仁爱的行为是教会的本质要素）在教义和生活上也得不到接受，那么必可推知，教会只思想真理，不思想良善。既如此，那么属于教会之人的思想是由彼此矛盾和对立的元素构成的，也就是说，思想邪恶和思想真理共存。他思想邪恶时与魔鬼同在，思想真理时与主同在。然而，真理与邪恶绝无可能一致，因为：<br />一个仆人不能事奉两个主，不是恨这个爱那个……（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路16.13.htm">16:13</a>）<br />当与仁分离之信确立这一点，并在生活中予以确认时，无论它如何谈论信的果实，教会到底在哪里呢？</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4766</b></p><p><b>4766.</b>
And I, whither do I come? That this signifies Where now is the church is evident from the representation of Reuben as being the faith of the church in general (n. 4731, 4734, 4761); and as Reuben says 
of himself, "and I, whither do I come?" it signifies "Where now is the faith of the church," or what is the same, "Where now is the church?" That there is no church where the heavenly Joseph is not 
(that is, the Lord as to Divine truth, specifically as to the Divine truth that the Lord's Human is Divine, and that charity is the essential of the church and consequently the works of charity) may be 
seen from what has been shown in this chapter concerning both these truths. [2] If this Divine truth that the Lord's Human is Divine is not received, it necessarily follows that a trine should be adored, 
and not one; and also that half of the Lord, namely, His Divine, should be adored, but not His Human; for who adores what is not Divine? And is the church anything where a trine is adored, one 
separately from another, or what is the same, where three are equally worshiped? For although the three are called one, still the thought distinguishes and makes three, and only the speech of the mouth 
says one. Let everyone consider in himself when he says that he acknowledges and believes in one God, whether he does not think of three; and when he says that the Father is God, the Son is God, and 
the Holy Spirit is God, and these also distinct in persons, and distinct as to functions, whether he can think that there is one God, except in the way that three distinct from one another make one by 
harmony, and also by condescension insofar as one proceeds from another. When therefore three gods are adored, where is the church? [3] But when the Lord only is adored, in whom there is a perfect 
trine, and who is in the Father and the Father in Him, as He Himself says:       "Though ye believe not Me, believe the works; that ye may know and believe, that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father" 
(John 10:38);       "He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father; believest thou not Philip that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me? Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me" 
(John 14:9-11),      "He that seeth Me seeth Him that sent Me" (John 7:45); </p>
<p>     "All Mine are Thine, and Thine are Mine" (John 17:10), then there is the Christian Church, as there is when the church 
abides in this that the Lord said: </p>
<p>     "The first of all the commandments is, Hear O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord; and thou shalt love the Lord thy God from all thy heart, and from all thy 
soul, and from all thy mind, and from all thy strength, this is the first commandment; and the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself; there is none other commandment 
greater than these" (Mark 12:29-31). That the "Lord our God" is the Lord may be seen in other places (Matt. 4:7, 10; 22:41-45; Luke 1:16, 17; John 20:28), as also that "Jehovah" in the Old Testament 
is called "Lord" in the New (see n. 2921). [4] If also this Divine truth is not received both in doctrine and in life-that love toward the neighbor, or charity, and hence the works of charity, are an 
essential of the church, it necessarily follows that it is of the church to think what is true, but not to think what is good; and thus that the thought of the man of the church may be in contradiction 
and opposition to itself; that is, may think what is evil and at the same time may think what is true; thus may by thinking evil be with the devil, and by thinking truth be with the Lord; when yet 
truth and evil do not at all agree, for "No servant can serve two lords, for either he will hate the one and love the other" (Luke 16:13). When faith separate establishes this, and also confirms it in 
life, no matter how it may speak of the fruits of faith, where then is the church? </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4766</b></p><p><b>4766.</b>
'And I, where do I go?' means, Where now is the Church? This is clear from the representation of 'Reuben' as the Church's faith in general, dealt with in <a href="4731.htm">4731</a>, <a href="4734.htm">4734</a>, <a href="4761.htm">4761</a>. And because Reuben says of 
himself, 'And I, where do I go?' the meaning is, Where now is the Church's faith? or what amounts to the same, Where now is the Church? For the Church does not exist where no heavenly Joseph - that is, 
no Lord as regards Divine Truth - does so. In particular it has no existence where the Divine Truth that the Lord's Human is Divine and the Truth that charity, and therefore the works of charity, is 
the essential element of the Church have no existence, as may be seen from what has been shown in this chapter about these two Truths. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 If there is no acceptance of this Divine Truth, that the 
Lord's Human is Divine, then of necessity it follows that a triad and not a single entity should be worshipped, and only half the Lord, that is, His Divine but not His Human (for is there anyone who worships 
that which is not Divine?) Is the Church anything when a triad is worshipped, each of the three separately from another, or what amounts to the same, when equal homage is paid to each of them? 
For although the three are called one, thought still keeps them separate and makes them three, the declaration 'a single entity' being no more than a saying spoken with the lips. Let anyone ask himself, 
when he says that he acknowledges and believes in one God, whether or not he has thoughts of three. Or when he says that the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God, and that these 
are distinct and separate both in their persons and as to their functions, whether he can think that there is one God, except in the way that three who are distinct from one another make one through 
unanimity and also through deference insofar as one goes forth from another. When therefore three gods are worshipped, where then is the Church? </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But if the Lord alone is worshipped, in whom the 
perfect Triad dwells, and in whom is the Father and the Father in Him, as He Himself says in the following places - </p>
<blockquote>
 Even though you do not believe Me, believe the works, that you may know and believe 
that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2010:38&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 10:38</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
He who has seen Me has seen the Father. Do you not believe, Philip, that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me? Believe Me that I 
am in the Father, and the Father in Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:9-11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:9-11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
He who sees Me sees Him who sent Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2012:45&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 12:45</a>. 
</blockquote>
All Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2017:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 17:10</a>. </p>
<p>- then it is a Christian Church, as it 
is when it keeps to the following spoken by the Lord, </p>
<blockquote>
The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord; therefore you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, 
and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength. This is the first commandment. The second is like it, You shall love your neighbour as yourself. There Is no other commandment 
greater than these. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2012:29-31&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 12:29-31</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The Lord our God' is the Lord, see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%204:7,10;%2022:43,%2044&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 4:7,10; 22:43, 44</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%201:16,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 1:16, 17</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2020:28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 20:28</a>, 'Jehovah' in the Old Testament being called 'the Lord' in the New, 
see <a href="2921.htm">2921</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 If this Divine Truth too goes unaccepted both in doctrine and in life - the Truth that love towards the neighbour, that is, charity, and therefore the works of charity, is the essential 
element of the Church - then of necessity it follows that thinking what is true exists in the Church but not thinking what is good. That being so, the thought of one who belongs to the Church may 
consist of elements that contradict and stand opposed to each other; that is to say, thinking what is evil and thinking what is true may be present simultaneously. In thinking what is evil he lives with 
the devil and in thinking what is true he does so with the Lord. But truth and evil cannot possibly be in accord, </p>
<blockquote>
No one can serve two masters, either he will hate the one and love the other . 
. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2016:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 16:13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>When faith separated from charity advocates this, and endorses it in life, then no matter how much it talks about the fruits of faith, where indeed is the Church? </p>

`Et ego quo ego venio?': quod significet ubi nunc Ecclesia, constat a repraesentatione `Reubenis' quod sit fides Ecclesiae in communi, de qua n. 4731, 4734, 4761; et quia Reuben de se dicit `et ego 
quo ego venio', significatur ubi nunc fides Ecclesiae? seu quod idem, ubi nunc Ecclesia?  Quod non Ecclesia sit ubi non caelestis Josephus, hoc est, Dominus (o)quoad Divinum Verum, in specie Divinum 
Verum quod Humanum Domini Divinum sit, et quod charitas sit essentiale Ecclesiae, proinde charitatis opera, constare potest ab illis quae in hoc capite de utroque ostensa sunt.  [2] Si non hoc Divinum 
Verum recipitur quod Humanum Domini Divinum sit, necessario inde sequitur quod trinum sit quod adorandum, non autem unum, et quoque quod dimidium Domini, nempe Ipsius Divinum, non autem Humanum, 
quis enim adorat non Divinum? numquid est Ecclesia ubi trinum adoratur unum separatim ab altero, seu quod idem, ubi tres aequaliter coluntur? nam tametsi tres dicuntur unum, usque cogitatio

<p>expendat hoc quisque apud se, cum dicit se agnoscere et credere unum Deum, annon cogitet de tribus; et cum dicit quod Pater sit Deus, Filius 
sit Deus, et Spiritus sanctus sit Deus, et illi quoque distincti in personas et distincti quoad munia, an cogitare possit quod sit unus Deus nisi ita ut tres inter se distincti unum faciant per concordantiam, 
et quoque per condescendentiam quatenus unus procedit ab altero; cum itaque tres dii adorantur, ubi tunc Ecclesia?  [3] at si solus Dominus, in Quo Trinum perfectum est, et in Quo est
