<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3867节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3867.</strong>创世记29:33.她又怀孕生子，就说，耶和华因为听见我被恨，所以又赐给我这个儿子。于是给他起名叫西缅。<br />“她又怀孕生子”和前面一样，表从外在之物到更内在之物的属灵孕育和生产。“就说，耶和华因为听见”在至高意义上表示圣规（providence），在内在意义上表示信的意愿，在内层意义上表示顺从，在外在意义上表示听见，在此表示唯独从主所接受的意愿中的信。“我被恨”表若意愿不与它对应的信之状态。“所以又赐给我这个儿子”表接下来发生的事。“于是给他起名叫西缅”表它的本质。</p>

Verse 33. And she conceived again, and bare a son, and said, Because Jehovah hath heard that I was hated, and hath given me this one also; and she called his name Simeon. "And she conceived again, and 
bare a son," signifies, as before, spiritual conception and birth from what is external toward things more interior; "because Jehovah hath heard," signifies in the supreme sense providence, in the internal 
sense the will of faith, in the interior sense obedience, in the external sense hearing, in the present case faith in the will, which is from the Lord alone; "that I was hated," signifies a state 
of faith if the will is not correspondent to it; "and hath given me this one also," signifies what is successive; "and she called his name Simeon," signifies its quality. </p>

Verse 33 And she conceived again and bore a son, and she said, For Jehovah has heard that I was hated and has given me this one also; and she called his name Simeon. </p>
<p>'She conceived again and bore 
a son', as previously, means spiritual conception and birth from what is external towards things that are more internal still. 'For Jehovah has heard' means in the highest sense providence, in the internal 
sense the will of faith, in the interior sense obedience, in the external sense the sense of hearing - faith in the will which is received from the Lord alone being meant here. 'That I was hated' 
means the state of faith if there is no will corresponding to it. 'And has given me this one also' means that which happens next. 'And she called his name Simeon' means the essential nature of it. </p>

Vers. 33.  Et concepit adhuc, et peperit filium, et dixit, Quia audivit Jehovah quod exosa ego, et dedit mihi etiam hunc, et vocavit nomen ejus Shimeon. `Concepit adhuc et peperit filium' significat, 
ut prius, conceptionem et partum spiritualem ab externo versus interiora magis: `quia audivit Jehovah' significat in supremo sensu providentiam, in interno fidei voluntatem, in interiore oboedientiam, 
in externo auditum, hic fidem voluntate quae a solo Domino: `quod exosa ego' significat statum fidei si non voluntas ei correspondens: `et dedit mihi etiam hunc' significat successivum: et 
vocavit nomen ejus Shimeon,' significat quale ejus. </p>
