<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4431节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4431.</strong>“希未人、哈抹的儿子”表从古人那里得来的。这从“儿子”的含义和“哈抹”的代表清楚可知：“儿子”，就是此处的示剑，是指内层真理，如刚才所述，因为“儿子”表示真理（参看<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>，<a href="2623.htm">2623</a>，<a href="3373.htm">3373</a>，<a href="4257.htm">4257</a>节）；“哈抹”是指该真理的父亲，因而是指从古人那里所得来的真理。事实上，从内存在于代表和宗教仪式中的真理源出于古时的教会。正因如此，哈抹也叫“希未人”；希未人就是表示古当中的这类真理的民族，因为这类真理自古时就存在于希未人当中。这就是为何哈抹在此被称为“希未人”的原因。<br />实际上，迦南地的所有民族皆表古时教会的某种良善或真理，因为属天的上古教会就在那里（<a href="4116.htm">4116</a>节）。但后来这些民族和这个教会存在于其中的所有其它民族一样，也转向偶像崇拜行为，因而这些民族也表示偶像崇拜的形式。不过，由于希未人自古时就表示内层真理，并且他们是较为善良正派的民族之一，他们当中的罪孽还没有到满盈的地步，也就是说，这个教会的真理还没有像在其它民族当中那样被彻底灭绝，所以按照主的旨意，基遍的希未人通过与约书亚并众首领立约而得以保存（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书9.15.htm">9:15</a>）。这些基遍人就是希未人（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书9.7.htm">9:7</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/书11.19.htm">11:19</a>）。综上所述，明显可知“希未人、哈抹的儿子”表示从古人那里所得来的内层真理。</p>

The son of Hamor the Hivite. That this signifies from the ancients, is evident from the signification of a "son," who here is Shechem, as being interior truth, of which just above (that a "son" denotes 
truth see n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 3373, 4257); and from the representation of Hamor, as being the father of this truth, thus meaning from the ancients; for the truth that was interior in the 
representatives and rituals emanated from the church of ancient time. For this reason Hamor is also named "the Hivite," for the Hivite nation was that by which such truth among the ancients was signified, 
because the Hivites had been in such truth from ancient time, and hence it is that Hamor is here called "the Hivite." For by all the nations in the land of Canaan some good or truth of the church 
of ancient time was signified, because the Most Ancient Church, which was celestial, was there (n. 4116). But afterwards these nations, like all the other nations among whom the church had been, turned 
aside to things idolatrous, and therefore by the same nations idolatries also are signified. Yet because the Hivites had from ancient time signified interior truth, and because they were one of the 
better disposed nations, with whom iniquity was not so far consummated (that is, the truth of the church was not so far extinguished as with others), the Gibeonite Hivites were of the Lord's providence 
preserved, by means of a covenant made with them by Joshua and the princes (Josh. 9:15). That they were Hivites may be seen in Joshua 9:7; 11:19. From all that has been said it is now evident whence 
it is that interior truth from the ancients is signified by "Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite." </p>

'The son of Hamor the Hivite' means received from the Ancients. This is clear from the meaning of 'the son', who in this case is Shechem, as interior truth, dealt with immediately above - for 'a son' 
means truth, see <a href="489.htm">489</a>, <a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="533.htm">533</a>, <a href="1147.htm">1147</a>, <a href="2623.htm">2623</a>, <a href="3373.htm">3373</a>, <a href="4257.htm">4257</a>; and from the representation of 'Hamor' as the father of that truth, and so truth received from the Ancients. Indeed the truth which was present 
interiorly within religious observances and within representatives emanated from the Church of old. This being so, Hamor was also named 'the Hivite', for the Hivites were a nation which meant that kind 
of truth among the Ancients, because that kind of it had existed with them since ancient times. This is the reason why at this point Hamor is called 'the Hivite'. </p>
<p></p>

 Actually every nation in the 
land of Canaan had in ancient times meant some good or else truth of the Church, for the Most Ancient Church, which was celestial, had existed there, <a href="4116.htm">4116</a>. But subsequently the nations there, like every 
other with whom the Church existed, turned aside into idolatrous practices, and therefore these same nations also mean forms of idolatry. But because the Hivites since ancient times meant interior 
truth, and because they were one of the more upright nations among whom iniquity had not become so complete, that is, the truth of the Church had not been completely annihilated, as it had among others, 
the Lord in His Providence therefore preserved the Hivite Gibeonites by means of the covenant which Joshua and the princes made with them, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%209:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 9:15</a>. For those Gibeonites were Hivites, see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%209:7;%2011:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 9:7; 11:19</a>. From all this one may now see how 'Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite' comes to mean interior truth received from the Ancients. </p>

`Filius Hamoris Hivaei': quod significet ab antiquis, constat a significatione `filii,' qui hic est Shechemus, quod sit verum interius, (o)de qua mox supra; quod `filius' sit verum, videatur n. 489, 
491, 533, 1147, 2623, 3373, 4257; et ex repraesentatione `Hamoris' quod sit pater illius veri, ita ab antiquis; emanavit enim verum quod interius erat in ritualibus et repraesentativis ab Ecclesia 
quae ab antiquo, et quia ita, Hamor etiam nominatur Hivaeus; gens enim Hivaea fuit per quam tale verum apud antiquos significatum fuit, quia ab antiquo tempore in tali fuerunt; inde est quod Hamor 
hic dicatur Hivaeus; per omnes enim gentes in terra Canaane aliquod bonum aut verum Ecclesiae tempore antiquo significatum fuit, nam Antiquissima Ecclesia, quae caelestis, ibi fuerat, n. 4116; 
sed postmodum illae gentes, sicut reliquae, apud quos Ecclesia fuit, deflexerunt ad idololatrica, ideo quoque per easdem significantur idololatriae; sed quia per `Hivaeos' ab antiquo significatum est 
verum interius, et illi inter gentes probiores fuerunt, apud quos non ita consummata fuit iniquitas, hoc est, non ita {1} verum Ecclesiae exstinctum, ut apud alios ideo {2} ex Providentia Domini 
conservati sunt Hivaei Gibeonitae per foedus quod Joshua et principes cum illis pepigerunt, Jos. ix 15; quod illi Hivaei fuerint, videatur Jos. (x)ix 7; xi 19. Ex his nunc patet unde est quod per 
`Shechemum filium Hamoris Hivaei' significetur, verum interius ab antiquis.      @1 i omne$      @2 i etiam$ </p>
