<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4266节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4266.</strong>“每样各分一群，交在仆人手下，就对仆人说，你们要在我前头过去，使群与群之间保持一段距离”表在它们要被引入的方式上所进行的有序排列。这从“交在手下”、“仆人”、“群”、“每样各分”、“在我前头过去”和“群与群之间保持一段距离”清楚可知：“交在手下”是指提供能力，因为“手”表示能力（参看<a href="878.htm">878</a>，<a href="3091.htm">3091</a>，<a href="3387.htm">3387</a>，<a href="3563.htm">3563</a>节）；“仆人”是指属于属世人的事物（<a href="3019.htm">3019</a>，<a href="3020.htm">3020</a>节），因为属世人或外在人里面的所有事物都服从于属灵人或内在人，故相对于后者，属世人里面的所有事物都是仆人，事实上被称作“仆人”；“群”是指记忆知识，以及认知，因而是指教义事物（参看<a href="3767.htm">3767</a>，<a href="3768.htm">3768</a>节），这些事物只要留在属世人或外在人里面，也就是那里的记忆中，还没有被植入在属灵人或内在人里面，就以“交在仆人手下的群”来表示；“每样各分”是指各自照着自己的类别，或属和种；“在我前头过去”和“群与群之间保持一段距离”是指为即将被接受的良善预备道路，因为此处所论述的主题是通过真理对良善的接受，以及这些在属世人里面的结合。从这些具体细节明显可知，整个这一节经文表示以它们要被引入的方式而有序排列<br />至于在属世人里面将真理引入良善，这绝无法解释清楚；因为当今的教会成员甚至不知道何为内在人或属灵人，尽管他经常谈论之。他也不知道，要成为教会成员，真理必须在外在人或属世人里面被引入良善；更不知道主在属世人里面进行有序排列，好叫属世人能与内在人结合起来。这些最一般、最普通的事，如今却被隐藏起来，以致人们甚至不知道它们的存在。因此，解释此处包含在内义中关于有序排列和引入的具体细节，就等于向他们谈论奥秘，因而等于谈论令他们完全无法相信的事。所以说了也是枉然，或如同把种子撒在水里或沙滩上。这就是为何具体细节被忽略过去，并且在此和接下来的几节只给出大体解释的原因。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4266</b></p><p><b>4266.</b>
And he gave into the hands of his servants each drove by itself; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space between drove and drove. That this signifies an orderly arrangement in 
regard to the way in which they were to be initiated, is evident from the signification of "giving into the hand," as being to instruct with power (that the "hand" denotes power, see n. 878, 3091, 3387, 
3563); from the signification of "servants," as being the things of the natural man (n. 3019, 3020), for all things of the natural or external man are subordinated to the spiritual or internal man, 
and hence all things in it are relatively things of service, and are called "servants;"-from the signification of a "drove," as being memory knowledges, and also knowledges, thus doctrinal things (see 
n. 3767, 3768), which so long as they are in the natural or external man (that is, in its memory), and are not yet implanted in the spiritual or internal man, are signified by the "droves given to 
the hand of the servants;"-from the signification of "each by itself," as being to everyone according to classes, or according to genera and species; from the signification of "passing over before me," 
and of "putting a space between drove and drove," as being to prepare the way for the good which was to be received; for the subject here treated of is the reception of good by truth, and the conjunction 
of these in the natural man. From these several particulars it is manifest that by all these things in general is signified an orderly arrangement in regard to the way in which they were to be 
initiated. As regards the initiation of truth into good in the natural man, this cannot possibly be set forth to the apprehension; for the man of the church at this day does not even know what the internal 
or spiritual man is, although he very often speaks of it. Neither does he know that in order to become a man of the church, truth must be initiated into good in the external or natural man; still 
less that there is any orderly arrangement by the Lord in that man in order to effect its conjunction with the internal man. These things, which are most general, are at this day so hidden that they 
are not known to exist; and therefore to set forth the particulars which are here contained in the internal sense respecting orderly arrangement and initiation, would be speaking nothing but arcana, 
and thus things merely incredible; consequently it would be speaking in vain, or like throwing seed upon water or sand. This is the reason why the particulars are passed over, and why here, as also in 
what follows in these verses, the generals only are set forth. </p>

'He gave them into the hand of his servants, drove by drove separately, and he said to his servants, Pass over in front of me and put a space between drove and drove' means an arrangement of them into 
the order in which they were to be introduced. This is clear from the meaning of 'giving into the hand' as providing with power, for 'the hand' means power, see <a href="878.htm">878</a>, <a href="3091.htm">3091</a>, <a href="3387.htm">3387</a>, <a href="3563.htm">3563</a>; from the meaning 
of 'servants' as things which belong to the natural man, dealt with in <a href="3019.htm">3019</a>, <a href="3020.htm">3020</a> - for all things in the natural or external man are subordinate to the spiritual or internal man, and therefore in 
relation to the latter all things in the natural man are servants and are actually called 'servants'; from the meaning of 'a drove' as facts and also cognitions, and so matters of doctrine, dealt with 
in <a href="3767.htm">3767</a>, <a href="3768.htm">3768</a>, which, as long as they remain in the natural or external man, that is, in the memory there, and have not yet been implanted in the spiritual or internal man, are meant by the droves which 
were given into the hand of those servants; from the meaning of 'separately' as to each one according to its own class, or according to its genus and species; from the meaning of 'passing over in 
front of me and puffing a space between drove and drove' as preparing a way for the good which was to be received - for the reception of good by truth and the joining together of these within the natural 
man is the subject here. From these specific details it is evident that this whole verse means the arrangement of them into the order in which they were to be introduced. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards the introduction 
of truth into good within the natural man, this cannot by any means be explained intelligibly, for the member of the Church at the present day does not even know what the internal or spiritual 
man is even though he often speaks about it. Nor does he know that if he is to become a member of the Church, truth has to be introduced to good within his external or natural man; and he knows even 
less about any arranging into order effected by the Lord within that natural man so that this may become joined to the internal man. These considerations, which are very general ones, are at the present 
day so hidden from people's eyes that the existence of them is not even known. For that reason if one were to explain to them the specific details contained here in the internal sense concerning 
arrangement into order and concerning introduction, one would be declaring utter mysteries to them and so things wholly beyond what they are able to believe. One's words would therefore be uttered in 
vain, or so to speak sown like seed on water or sand. This is the reason why specific details are being passed over here, and in this and the following verses of this section no more than a general explanation 
is given. </p>

</p><b>4266.</b>
`Dedit in manum servorum suorum catervam catervam seorsim; </p>
<p>et dixit ad servos suos, Transite ante me, et spatium ponatis inter catervam et inter catervam': quod significet ordinationem quomodo initiarentur, 
constat ex significatione `dare in manum' quod sit instruere potentia; quod `manus' sit potentia, videatur n. 878, 3091, 3387, 3563; ex significatione `servorum' quod sint illa quae sunt 
naturalis hominis, de qua n. 3019, 3020, omnia enim quae sunt naturalis seu externi hominis subordinata sunt spirituali seu interno homini, inde omnia quae ibi, sunt respective servitia, et vocantur 
`servi'; ex significatione `catervae' quod sint scientifica, tum cognitiones, ita doctrinalia, de qua n. 3767, 3768; haec quamdiu in naturali seu externo homine, hoc est, in ejus memoria sunt et 
nondum implantata spirituali seu interno homini, significantur per `catervas datas in manum servorum'; ex significatione `seorsim' quod sit unicuique secundum classes, aut secundum genera et species; 
ex significatione `transire ante me, et spatium ponere inter catervam et catervam' quod sit praeparare viam ad bonum quod reciperetur, nam de receptione boni a vero et de conjunctione eorum in 
naturali homine hic agitur: ex (t)singulis his patet quod per omnia illa in communi significetur ordinatio quomodo initiarentur {1}.  Quod initiationem veri in bonum in naturali homine attinet, illa 
nullatenus ad captum exponi potest, homo enim Ecclesiae hodie, ne {2} quidem novit quid internus seu spiritualis homo (o)est tametsi de illo saepius loquitur, nec novit quod verum initiandum sit 
bono in externo seu naturali `homine' ut fiat homo Ecclesiae; minus quod aliqua ordinatio a Domino sit in illo homine, ut fiat conjunctio ejus cum interno {3}; haec quae communissima sunt, hodie ita 
latent ut non sciatur quod sint; </p>
<p>quapropter si singula exponerentur quae hic in sensu interno de ordinatione et initiatione continentur, foret mera arcana loqui, ita mere incredibilia, consequenter 
foret in vanum, aut sicut in aquam aut arenam sementem mittere; haec causa est quod singularia praetereantur et hic, ut quoque in sequentibus hujus periodi, solum communia exponantur.      @1 
initiaretur$      @2 i et quoque doctissimus$      @3 sit in naturali seu externo homine, ut initiatio et dein conjunctio ejus fiat cum Interno$ </p>
