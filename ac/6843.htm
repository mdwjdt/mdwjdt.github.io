<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6843节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6843.</strong>“祂说，不要靠近”表他目前不可用感官力量来思想神性。这从“靠近耶和华”的含义清楚可知，“靠近耶和华”是指思想神性。当论及一个人接近主时，“靠近”表示思想神性，这是因为人无法以身体接近神性，就像一个人接近另一个人那样，只能以心智，因而以思维和意愿来接近。其它接近神性的方法是不可能存在的，因为神性在时空之上，就存在于与一个人同在的那些被称为“状态”的事物中，也就是说，爱的状态和信的状态，因而心智的两种官能，即思维和意愿的状态中；人能通过这些状态接近神性。这解释了为何他先脱下鞋子表示他不可思想神性，即不可用外在感官力量思想神性。之所以用“目前”这个词，是因为属世层的外在感官力量是最后重生的，因而也是最后接受来自神性的流注的。此处所论述的状态还不是感官力量能接受流注的那种。关于感官力量，可参看接下来的内容。</p>

And He said, Draw not nigh hither. That this signifies that he must not still think of the Divine from sensuous things, is evident from the signification of "drawing nigh to Jehovah," as being to think 
of the Divine. That "to draw nigh," when said of a man's approach to the Lord, denotes thought about the Divine, is because man cannot approach the Divine with the body, as a man approaches a man, 
but with the mind, thus with the thought and the will. There is no other access to the Divine, because the Divine is above the things of place and time, being in those things with man which are called 
"states," namely, states of love and states of faith, thus states of both faculties of the mind, that is, of the will and of the thought; by these man can approach the Divine. Hence it is that here, 
by "Draw not nigh hither," is signified that he must not think of the Divine, that is, from the external sensuous things which are signified by the "shoes that he was first to pull off." It is said still, 
because the external sensuous things of the natural are the last to be regenerated, and thus last receive influx from the Divine; and the state here treated of was not yet such that sensuous things 
could receive the influx. As regards sensuous things, see what now follows. </p>

'And He said, Do not draw near here' means that in thinking about the Divine he should not do so as yet with the powers of the senses. This is clear from the meaning of 'drawing near Jehovah' as thinking 
about the Divine. The reason why the expression 'drawing near' when used of a person's approach to the Lord means thought about the Divine is that a person cannot draw near the Divine physically 
in the way one person draws near another, only mentally, that is, in thought and will. No other kind of approach can be made to the Divine, for the Divine is above the things that belong to space and 
time and is present in those things with a person which are called states, that is to say, states of love and states of faith, thus states of both powers of the mind - will and thought. It is by means 
of these that a person can draw near the Divine. This explains why here 'Do not draw near here' means that in thinking about the Divine he should not do so with his outward sensory powers, meant by his 
shoes which he had first to take off. The expression 'as yet' is used because the outward sensory powers of the natural are regenerated last and so are the last to receive influx from the Divine. And 
the state which is the subject here was not yet such that the sensory powers could receive the things that flowed in. Regarding the powers of the senses see what is said immediately below. </p>

`Et dixit, Ne appropinques huc': quod significet quod non de Divino cogitaret adhuc ex sensualibus, constat ex significatione `appropinquare ad Jehovam' quod sit cogitare de Divino; quod appropinquare' 
cum dicitur de homine ad Dominum, sit cogitatio de Divino, est quia homo ad Divinum non accedere potest corpore sicut homo ad hominem, sed mente, ita cogitatione et voluntate; accessus non alius est 
ad Divinum, quia Divinum est supra illa quae loci et temporis sunt, {1}est in illis apud hominem quae vocantur status, nempe status amoris et status fidei, ita status utriusque facultatis mentis, nempe 
voluntatis et cogitationis, per {2}haec appropinquare potest (d)homo ad Divinum; inde est quod hic per `ne appropinques huc' significetur quod de Divino non cogitaret, nempe ex sensualibus externis, 
quae (x)significantur per `calceos, quos primum detraheret'; (t)dicitur `adhuc' quia sensualia externa naturalis ultimo regenerantur, et sic ultimo recipiunt influxum a Divino, et status de quo hic 
agitur nondum erat ut sensualia (t)reciperent illa; de sensualibus videantur quae nunc sequuntur. 	@1 et in illis quae apud hominem sunt$ 	@2 quae$ </p>
