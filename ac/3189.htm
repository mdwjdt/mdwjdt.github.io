<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3189节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3189.</strong>“和她的少女们”表从属的情感。这从“少女”的含义清楚可知。当利百加被称为“少女”时，“少女”是指含有纯真的情感（参看<a href="3067.htm">3067</a>，<a href="3110.htm">3110</a>节）；但当那些跟着利百加服侍她的人也被称为“少女”时，“少女”表示从属的情感。每一情感都看似一个简单或单一实体，但事实上，它包含无数细节（参看<a href="3078.htm">3078</a>节）。所有这些细节就是以无法理解的形式被联结起来的情感，它们还相互从属，因为有些是管理的，有些是服侍的。天堂社群就具有这种形式，事实上整个天堂也是。因为主照着存在于祂自己里面的神性形式按秩序排列它们。主的属灵国度照着其神性人里面情感的有序排列而具有自己的形式。这种有序排列就是本章，以及接下来的章节内义所论述的主题。但其中很少的细节能理性解释清楚，因为它们适合天使理解。</p>

And her damsels. That this signifies the subservient affections, is evident from the signification of "damsel," when Rebekah was so called, as being an affection in which is innocence (see n. 3067, 3110); 
but when they are so called who followed Rebekah to serve her, they signify subservient affections. Every affection appears as something simple, or as one thing; but that it contains things innumerable, 
may be seen above (n. 3078); all things which are therein are affections, consociated in an incomprehensible form; they are also mutually subordinate to one another, for there are some which 
administer, and some which serve. The societies of heaven are in such a form, nay, so is the whole heaven, being arranged in order by the Lord according to the Divine form which is in Himself. The form 
of the Lord's spiritual kingdom comes forth in accordance with the orderly arrangement of the affections in His Divine Human, which orderly arrangement is treated of in the internal sense of this chapter 
and the following one. But there are very few things herein which can be unfolded to the apprehension, they being adapted to the perception of angels. </p>

'And her maids' means subsidiary affections. This is clear from the meaning of 'a girl'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> when Rebekah is called such, as an affection that has innocence within it, dealt with in <a href="3067.htm">3067</a>, <a href="3110.htm">3110</a>; but when 
those who followed Rebekah to serve her are called 'maids', subsidiary affections are meant. Every affection appears to be a simple or single entity, but in fact it contains countless details within itself, 
see <a href="3078.htm">3078</a>. All these details are affections grouped together and existing in a form beyond comprehension. They also stand in positions subordinate one to another, for there are some that direct 
and others that obey. The communities of heaven assume a similar form, indeed heaven as a whole does so; for they are ordered by the Lord according to the Divine form which exists in Himself. The Lord's 
spiritual kingdom assumes its form in accordance with the ordered arrangement of affections in His Divine Human. This arrangement is the subject in the internal sense of this chapter and of those that 
follow. But very few of these details are able to be explained intelligibly, being suited to the perception of angels.

`Et puellae ejus': quod significet affectiones inservientes, constat ex significatione `puellae,' cum ita dicta Rebecca, quod sit affectio in qua innocentia, de qua n. 3067, 3110; at cum ita dicuntur 
quae Rebeccam sequebantur ut inservirent, significantur affectiones inservientes. Unaquaevis affectio apparet sicut aliquod simplex aut unum, at quod innumerabilia contineat, videatur n. 3078; omnia 
quae ibi, sunt affectiones, consociatae in forma incomprehensibili; sunt quoque sibi mutuo subordinatae, sunt enim quae ministrant, et quae famulantur; societates caeli in tali forma sunt, immo totum 
caelum, ordinatae a Domino secundum formam Divinam quae in Ipso; forma regni spiritualis Domini {1}existit secundum ordinationem affectionum in Divino Humano Ipsius, de qua ordinatione in hoc capite 
et in sequentibus in sensu interno agitur; sed paucissima sunt quae ad captum explicari possunt; sunt adaequata perceptioni angelorum. @1 exstitit$  </p>
