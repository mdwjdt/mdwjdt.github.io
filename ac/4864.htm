<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4864节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4864.</strong>“犹大看见她”表那时犹太民族的宗教表象如何看待代表性教会的内在事物。这从“看见”的含义，以及“他玛”和“犹大”的代表清楚可知：“看见”是指洞察和理解（<a href="2150.htm">2150</a>，<a href="2325.htm">2325</a>，<a href="2807.htm">2807</a>，<a href="3764.htm">3764</a>，<a href="3863.htm">3863</a>节），因而是指看待；“她”所指的“他玛”是指代表属灵和属天事物的教会（<a href="4829.htm">4829</a>，<a href="4831.htm">4831</a>节），在此是指该教会的内在，因为所论述的主题是犹太民族的宗教表象看待和接受内在的方式；“犹大”尤指犹太民族（<a href="4815.htm">4815</a>，<a href="4842.htm">4842</a>节），由此指该民族的宗教表象。因为在圣言中，当提及这个民族时，在内义上所指的是涉及其教会的某种事物。事实上，内义与任何民族的事件和历史无关，只与教会事物方面的性质有关。由此明显可知，“犹大看见她”表示那时犹太民族的宗教表象如何看待代表性教会的内在事物。</p>

And Judah saw her. That this signifies how the religiosity of the Jewish nation at that time regarded the internal things of the representative church, is evident from the signification of "seeing," 
as being to notice and understand (n. 2150, 2325, 2807, 3764, 3863), thus to consider; and from the representation of Tamar, who is meant by "her," as being a church representative of spiritual and celestial 
things (n. 4829, 4831), here the internal of that church, because the subject treated of is the way in which that internal was regarded and received by the religiosity of the Jewish nation; and 
from the representation of Judah, as being specifically the Jewish nation (n. 4815, 4842), consequently the religiosity of that nation; for where that nation is mentioned in the Word, something relating 
to its church is meant in the internal sense. For the internal sense has no concern with the events and history of any nation, but only with its quality as to the things of the church. From this 
it is evident that by Judah's seeing her is signified how the religiosity of the Jewish nation at that time regarded the internal things of a representative church. </p>

'And Judah saw her' means the way in which at that time the semblance of religion existing among the Jewish nation looked on the internal features of the representative Church. This is clear from the 
meaning of 'seeing' as discerning and understanding, dealt with in <a href="2150.htm">2150</a>, <a href="2325.htm">2325</a>, <a href="2807.htm">2807</a>, <a href="3764.htm">3764</a>, <a href="3863.htm">3863</a>, and so as looking on; from the representation of Tamar, to whom 'her' refers here, as the Church representative 
of spiritual and celestial things, dealt with in <a href="4829.htm">4829</a>, <a href="4831.htm">4831</a>, at this point as the internal aspect of that Church, for the subject is the way in which it was looked on and accepted by the semblance 
of religion existing among the Jewish nation; and from the representation of 'Judah' as the Jewish nation specifically, dealt with in <a href="4815.htm">4815</a>, <a href="4842.htm">4842</a>, and from this as the semblance of religion among 
that nation For when this nation is mentioned in the Word something to do with that Church is meant in the internal sense. The internal sense has no interest at all in the memorable and historical exploits 
of a nation, only in what it is like so far as things of the Church are concerned. From this it is evident that 'Judah saw her' means the way in which at that time the semblance of religion existing 
among the Jewish nation looked on the internal features of the representative Church. </p>

`Et vidit illam Jehudah':  quod significet religiosum gentis Judaicae quomodo tunc consideraret interna Ecclesiae repraesentativae, constat ex significatione `videre' quod sit appercipere et intelligere, 
de qua n. 2150, 2325, 2807, 3764, 3863, ita considerare; a repraesentatione `Tamaris' quae hic est `illa', quod sit Ecclesia repraesentativa spiritualium et caelestium, de qua n. 4829, 4831, 
hic internum ejus Ecclesiae, quia de illo agitur quomodo consideratum et receptum a gentis Judaicae religioso; et a repraesentatione `Jehudae' quod sit in specie gens Judaica, de qua n. 4815, 4842, 
proinde religiosum illius gentis, nam ubi gens in Verbo memoratur, in sensu interno intelligitur id quod est Ecclesiae illius; {1}sensus enim internus memoranda et historica de aliqua gente nihil 
curat, sed modo {2} quale quoad illa quae sunt Ecclesiae. Inde patet quod per `vidit illam Jehudah significetur religiosum gentis Judaicae quomodo tunc consideraret interna Ecclesiae repraesentativae. @1
