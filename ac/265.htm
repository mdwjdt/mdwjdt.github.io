<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第265节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>265.</strong>对于“丈夫”表理性，这从本章第六节可知。彼处说女人拿果子给丈夫，他就吃了，这表示他的认同。这也从158节所作的解释可知，彼处的“男人”表具有智慧聪明的人。到了此处，“男人”表理性，因为当人吃了知识树以后，智慧聪明就失落了，尽管理性看似和聪明相同。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]265.</strong> The symbolism of the husband or man as the rational capacity can be seen from verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_265/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_6" target=_top>6</a> of this chapter, which says that the woman gave to her husband, who was with her, and he ate, which symbolized his consent. The symbolism can also be seen from what was shown about a man in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_265/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_158" target=_top>158</a>, where it means a wise and understanding person. Here, though, because the eating from the tree of knowledge had destroyed wisdom and understanding, the man means the ability to reason, since nothing else was left. The rational capacity imitates, or seems to resemble, an intelligent understanding. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 265</b></p><p><b>265.</b>
That by "man [vir]" is signified the rational, appears from verse 6 of this chapter, in that the woman gave to her man with her, and he did eat, by which is meant his consent; and the same is also evident 
from what was said of the man in n. 158, where by him is meant one who is wise and intelligent. Here however "man" denotes the rational, because in consequence of the destruction of wisdom and intelligence 
by eating of the tree of knowledge, nothing else was left, for the rational is imitative of intelligence, being as it were its semblance. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 265</b></p><p><b>265.</b>
'Husband' (vir) means the rational. This is clear from verse 6 of this chapter which says that the woman gave to her husband (vir) with her and he ate, meaning that he conceded. It is also clear from 
what was shown concerning the word 'man' (vir) in <a href="158.htm">158</a>, where that word was used to mean a person who is wise and intelligent. Here however, because wisdom and intelligence had perished as a result of 
eating from the tree of knowledge, it means the rational, for nothing else was left. Indeed the rational is an imitation or seeming likeness of intelligence.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 265</b>
</p><b>265.</b>
Quod per 'virum' significetur rationale, constat a vers. 6 hujus capitis, quod 'mulier dederit viro suo secum, et comederit,' quo significatum quod consenserit; et ab iis quae de viro ostensa sunt n. 
158; ubi per eam intellectus est sapiens et intelligens, hic autem, quia sapientia et intelligentia per esum ex arbore scientiae periit, rationale, quia non aliud reliquum erat; rationale enim est intelligentiae 
aemulum seu quasi simile.
