<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6191节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6191.</strong>经历使我知道，主通过天使和灵人掌管一个人；这些经历如此确凿，以致我丝毫没有怀疑的余地。因为多年来，我的一切思维和一切情感，直至最小的细节，都是通过灵人和天使流入的。我蒙允许如此清楚地感知这一点，以至于再没有比这更清楚的了；因为我已经发觉、看见并听见这些灵人或天使究竟是谁，他们是何性质，来自哪里。每当有不好的东西进入我的思维或意愿时，我便与那些应承担责任的人交谈，并斥责他们。我还发现，他们注入这类东西的能力受到天使的约束；又发现这一切是如何做到的；同样经常看见他们被天使驱逐，然后新的灵人取而代之；于是从他们那里再次有了流注。我也蒙允许分辨这些灵人来自哪里，或他们是哪些社群的使臣。<br />此外，我常得着机会与这些社群本身交谈。尽管我的每一个思维和情感，直至最小细节，都是通过灵人或天使流入的，但我仍像以前一样思考，像以前一样意愿，像以前一样与其他人交谈，没有人发现与我以前的生活有什么不同。我知道，几乎没有人相信我所说的都是事实，但这仍是永恒的绝对真理。</p>

That man is governed by the Lord by means of angels and spirits, has been given me to know by experience so manifest as not to leave even the smallest doubt concerning it; for now through a course of 
many years all my thoughts and all my affections, even to the most minute of all, have flowed in by means of spirits and angels. This it has been given me to perceive so plainly that nothing could be 
more plain; for I have perceived, I have seen, and I have heard, who they were, what was their quality, and where they were. And when anything adverse fell into my thought or will, I have spoken with 
them and chided them. And I have also observed that the power they had of infusing such things was restrained by the angels; and also in what manner; and likewise often that they were driven away, and 
that then new spirits were present in their place, from whom again there was influx. It has also been given me to perceive whence those spirits came, or of what societies they were the subjects; and 
an opportunity of speaking with those societies themselves has likewise frequently been granted. And notwithstanding that everything, even to the most minute, of the thoughts and affections, flowed in 
through the spirits and angels, still I thought as before, and willed as before, and conversed with men as before, no difference from my former life being observed by anyone. I am aware that scarcely 
anyone will believe that such is the fact, but still it is an eternal verity. </p>

Experience enabling me to know that the Lord governs a person by means of angels and spirits has been so conclusive that I have been left with not the slightest shadow of doubt. For many years now all 
my thoughts and all my affections, down to the last detail, have flowed in by means of spirits and angels. This I have been allowed to perceive so plainly that nothing could be plainer; for I have perceived, 
seen, and heard who exactly the spirits or angels were, what they were like, and where they came from. And whenever anything inimical has come into my thought or will I have spoken to and rebuked 
those who were responsible. I have also noticed that their power to introduce any such thing was curbed by the angels, observed how this was done, and also seen that they were often driven away 
by the angels. When they had been driven away, I noticed that in their place new spirits were present, from whom influx again took place. I was also allowed to discern where those spirits were from, that 
is, of which communities they were emissaries. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Besides this I have often been given the opportunity to talk to those actual communities. Although every one of my thoughts and affections, down 
to the last detail, was flowing in through spirits or angels, my thinking was nevertheless as it had been before, and my desires as they had been before. I mixed with other people as I had done before, 
without anyone noticing any difference in my life from what it had been before. I realize that scarcely anyone will believe what I am saying; but all the same it is the absolute truth. </p>

</p><b>6191.</b>
Quod homo per angelos et spiritus regatur a Domino, ex tam manifesta experientia mihi scire datum est ut de eo ne quidem minimum dubii relictum sit; nam nunc per plures annos omnes meae cogitationes 
et omnes meae affectiones quoad omnium singularissima mediis spiritibus et angelis influxerunt; hoc datum est tam evidenter percipere ut nihil evidentius, percepi enim vidi, et audivi quinam essent, 
quales essent et ubinam essent; et cum in cogitationem aut voluntatem aliquid adversum incideret, cum illis locutus sum et illos increpavi; et quoque animadverti quod potentia infundendi talia illis refraenata 
sit ab angelis, ut et quomodo, et quoque saepe quod abacti; et cum abacti sunt quod loco eorum novi adfuerint a quibus iterum influxus; tum appercipere datum est unde illi spiritus, seu quarum 
societatum subjecta essent; [2]data etiam fuit saepe cum ipsis illis societatibus copia loquendi; et tametsi omnia quoad singularissima cogitationum et affectionum per spiritus et angelos influebant, 
usque tamen cogitavi sicut prius, et volui sicut prius, et conversatus cum hominibus sicut prius, a nemine aliqua differentia a vita priore observata; scio quod tale vix aliquis credat sed usque est 
veritas aeterna. </p>
