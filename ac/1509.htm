<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1509节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1509.</strong>我曾与那些在世时不关心社会利益，只关心自己，对公众福祉毫无用处的灵人呆了好几天。他们唯一的目的就是过奢华的生活，穿着锦衣华服，发财致富；他们习惯于虚伪的表现、各种曲意的阿谀奉承，并展现出乐于效劳的形像，不过仅仅是为了他们能得到注意，掌管主人的财物；而他们却鄙视所有真诚服务的人。我发现他们曾是朝臣。他们的气场使我无法集中精力，很难完成并思想严肃、真实和良善的事，以致最后我几乎不知该怎么办。当象这样的人来到灵人们当中时，他们也会使其无精打采。在来世，他们是无用的成员，无论到哪都会遭到驱逐。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1509.</strong> For several days I had with me the kind of spirits who had not concentrated at all on the good of society when they lived in the world but on themselves. They had been useless, so far as political office goes, and their only goal had been to live sumptuously, wear glamorous clothes, and grow rich. They were used to putting up pretenses; to finding means of worming their way in everywhere by various kinds of flattery; and to vying for office with the sole purpose of making themselves visible and taking charge of their overlord's resources. Anyone engaged in any serious kind of work they regarded with contempt. They had been courtiers, I perceived.<br />The effect they had was to sap me of all my energy and to make it burdensome for me to act on or think about anything worthwhile, anything true or good 钬?so terribly burdensome that in the end I hardly knew what to do.<br />When spirits like this come among other spirits, they infect them with a similar sluggishness. In the other life, they are useless members of society and are rejected wherever they go. </p>

For several days such spirits were with me as during their life in this world had cared nothing for the good of society, but only for themselves, being useless members of the commonwealth, and who had 
had no end but to live sumptuously, to be clothed splendidly, and to grow rich; being well practiced in simulation, and in ways of insinuating themselves by various forms of flattering assent and a 
display of services, but only that they might seem devoted, and be intrusted with their master's goods, while they looked down with contempt upon all who were earnestly employed. It was perceived that 
they had been courtiers. The effect of their sphere was to take from me the power of close application, and to make it so irksome for me to act and to think in serious matters, true and good, that at 
last I scarcely knew what to do. When such as these come among spirits, they induce on them a similar torpor. In the other life they are useless members, and are rejected wherever they come.  </p>

There were once with me for several days spirits who during their lifetime had been such that they had not striven for the good of society, but only for themselves, serving no useful purpose to the general 
public. Their sole end in view had been to live sumptuously, to be dressed splendidly, and to grow rich; and they had been accustomed to false presences and to the ways of worming themselves in 
by various forms of flattering assent and of readiness to be of service, solely to the end that they might be noticed and be given charge of their master's property. All who were earnestly serving a 
purpose they looked down on with contempt. I perceived that they had been courtiers. Their sphere was such that it took away from me my whole concentration and made it so extremely troublesome for me 
to carry out and to think about serious things, true and good, that at length I hardly knew what to do. When such individuals as these come among spirits they bring upon them a similar listlessness. In 
the next life they are useless members and are cast out from wherever they go. </p>

</p><b>1509.</b>
Fuerunt apud me per aliquot dies tales spiritus, qui dum vixerunt in mundo, nihil societatis bono sed sibi studuerunt, ad functiones in republica inutiles, quique pro fine habuerunt solum opipare vivere, 
splendide vestiri, ditescere, assuefacti simulationibus et modis se insinuandi varia assentatione et affectatione officiorum, solum ut viderentur, et administrarent domini bona, cum despectu aspicientes 
omnes qui in seriis functionibus; quod in aulis fuerint, perceptum: illorum sphaera fuit quod tollerent mihi omne studium, et mihi inferrent molestiam agendi et cogitandi seria, vera et bona, 
tam grave ut tandem vix scirem quid facerem: tales cum inter spiritus veniunt, iis inducunt similem torporem; sunt in altera vita inutilia membra et rejiciuntur ubicumque veniunt. </p>
