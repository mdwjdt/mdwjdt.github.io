<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7803.</strong>至于灵人与木星居民的交谈，既有惩罚他们的灵人，也有教导的灵人，还有掌控他们的灵人。惩罚灵来到一个人身体的左侧，向后背倾斜；当在那里时，他们就从此人的记忆提取他的一切行为和思维；事实上，灵人做这种事轻而易举，因为一来到一个人那里，他们就立刻进入他的全部记忆（<a href="6199.htm">6199</a>，<a href="6193.htm">6193</a>，<a href="6198.htm">6198</a>，<a href="6199.htm">6199</a>，<a href="6214.htm">6214</a>节）。他们若发现他行为不端，或思想不正，就会指责他，还以脚或手的关节处的疼痛，或上腹部周围的疼痛惩罚他。此外，当被允许时，灵人做这种事也是非常巧妙的。当这些惩罚者来到一个人这里时，他们就会激起惊恐和惧怕；由此让他意识到他们的靠近。当恶灵，尤其那些活在世上时曾做过强盗的恶灵靠近人时，他们也能激起恐惧。为叫我知道这些灵人在来到他们星球成员这里时如何行事，一个这样的灵人也被允许靠近我。当他在附近时，我明显被惊恐和惧怕抓住了；然而，我并未因这种惧怕而从内心颤抖，只是表面上如此，因为我知道他就是这种灵人。我还看见他，他看上去就像一团乌云，云中有移动的星星；移动的星星表示虚假；恒定的星星表示真理。他来到我的左侧朝向后背，也开始因我所行和所思的事指责我；他把这些事从我的记忆提取出来，并开始曲解。不过，在场的天使阻止了他。当他发现，他与另一个人，而非他自己星球上的人在一起时，便开始与我交谈，说，当来到一个人那里时，他就知道这个人所行或所思的每一件事。他还严厉指责他，并且以各种疼痛惩罚他。</p>

As regards the speech of spirits with the inhabitants of the planet Jupiter, there are spirits who chastise; there are those who instruct; and there are those who rule them. The spirits who chastise 
apply themselves to the left side, and incline themselves toward the back; and when they are there, they draw forth from the man's memory all his deeds and thoughts; for this is easy to spirits, because, 
when they come to a man, they come instantly into all his memory (n. 6199, 6193, 6198, 6199, 6214). If they find that he has done evil or thought evil, they reprove him, and also chastise him with 
a pain in the joints of the feet or of the hands, or with pain about the epigastric region; this moreover, spirits can do dexterously, when it is permitted. When such chastisers come to a man, they excite 
horror together with fear; whereby he is aware of their approach. Evil spirits can excite fear when they approach anyone, especially those who when they lived in the world had been robbers. That 
I might know in what manner these spirits act when they come to a man of their earth, it was permitted that such a spirit should come also to me. When he was near, horror attended with fear palpably 
seized me; but I was not terrified and in horror inwardly, but outwardly, because I knew that he was such a spirit. He was also seen, and appeared like a dark cloud with little moving stars in the cloud; 
moving stars signify falsities; but fixed stars truths. He applied himself to my left side, toward the back; and he also began to reprove me on account of the things I had done and thought, which 
he drew forth from my memory and gave a wrong interpretation to; but he was hindered by the angels who also were present. When he noticed that he was with another than a man of his own earth, he began 
to speak to me, and to say that when he comes to a man, he knows all and everything which the man has done and thought; also that he severely reproves him, and likewise chastises him with various pains. </p>

With regard to the talking of spirits to the inhabitants of the planet Jupiter, there are spirits who chastise, those who instruct, and those who rule them. The spirits who chastise come to the left 
side of a person's body and lean round towards the back of it. Once they are there they draw from the person's memory all his deeds and thoughts; for spirits do this with ease, because on reaching a person 
they immediately enter into all his memory, <a href="6192.htm">6192</a>, <a href="6193.htm">6193</a>, <a href="6198.htm">6198</a>, <a href="6199.htm">6199</a>, <a href="6214.htm">6214</a>. If they find that he has behaved badly or thought wrongly they reproach him and also chastise him with pain in the joints 
of his feet or his hands, or with pain around the region of the epigastrium. Spirits can also do this with great skill when they are allowed to. When such spirits come towards a person they strike horror 
and fear into him; this is how one knows of their arrival. Evil spirits can strike fear when they approach someone, especially those who were robbers when they lived in the world. To enable me to 
know how those spirits act when they come towards a member of their planet one such spirit was also allowed to approach me. When he was near I was plainly seized by horror and fear; yet I did not shake 
inwardly with fear, only outwardly, because I knew he was one of their kind of spirits. I also saw him; he looked like a dark cloud with little moving stars in it, moving stars being a sign of falsities, 
but fixed stars a sign of truths. He came to my left side towards my back, and also began to reproach me because of my deeds and thoughts, which he drew from my memory and started to misconstrue. 
But angels who were also present put a stop to what he was doing. When he realized that he was with someone other than a member of his own planet, he began to talk to me, saying that when he went 
towards a person he learned every single thing that person had done or thought. He reproached that person severely too, and also chastised him with various pains. </p>

Quod loquelam spirituum cum incolis telluris Jovis attinet, sunt spiritus qui castigant, sunt qui instruunt, et sunt qui regunt illos.  Spiritus qui castigant applicant se lateri sinistro, et se inclinant 
versus tergum; et cum ibi, depromunt ex memoria hominis omnia ejus facta et cogitata; hoc enim spiritibus facile est, nam cum ad hominem alluunt, in omnem ejus memoriam ilico veniunt, n. 6192, 
6193, 6198, 6199, 6214; {1} si inveniunt quod male egerit aut male cogitaverit, redarguunt illum, et quoque castigant dolore artuum pedum sive manuum, aut dolore circa epigastricam regionem; hoc quoque 
possunt spiritus dextre, quando permittitur; tales cum ad hominem veniunt, incutiunt horrorem {2}cum timore; inde scit adventum eorum; incutere timorem possunt mali spiritus cum aliquem adeunt, imprimis 
illi qui, dum vixerunt in mundo, fuerunt latrones.  Ut scirem quomodo {3}illi spiritus faciunt, cum ad hominem suae telluris veniunt, permissum fuit, ut talis spiritus etiam me adiret; quando prope 
erat, horror cum timore (t)me occupavit manifeste, at non interius sed exterius territus horrui, quia novi quod talis spiritus esset; visus etiam est, et apparuit sicut nubes obscura cum stellulis 
mobilibus in nube; stellae mobiles significant falsitates, at stellae fixae veritates; is se applicuit sinistro meo lateri versus tergum; et quoque incepit me redarguere ex factis et cogitatis, quae deprompsit 
ex memoria mea, et sinistre interpretabatur; sed impeditus est ab angelis qui etiam aderant.  {4} Cum appercepit quod apud alium quam {5} suae telluris hominem esset, coepit mecum loqui et dicere 
quod omnia et singula quae homo egit et cogitavit, cum venit ad illum, sciat; tum quod severe redarguat illum, et quoque castiget variis doloribus. 	@1 i et$ 	@2 ex quo$ 	@3 hi$ 	@4 i Et$ 	@5 i apud$ </p>
