<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8966节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8966.</strong>试探有助于确认或强化信之真理，并植入它们，以及把它们灌输到意愿中，以便它们能变成仁之良善。因为如前所述，人靠信之真理与邪恶和虚假争战；并且由于在这种争战期间，他的心智专注于真理，所以当他得胜时，就确认或强化了他对这些真理的信仰，并将它们植入自己里面。同时，他将攻击他的邪恶和虚假视为仇敌，并把它们从自己身上赶走。试探还有助于抑制爱自己爱世界的欲望，使人谦卑下来。也就是说，它们会让他适合接受来自主的天堂生命，这生命是诸如重生之人所拥有的那种新生命，</p>

Temptations conduce to the confirmation of the truths of faith, also to the implantation of them, and the insinuation of them into the will, that they may become goods of charity. For, as before said, 
man fights from the truths of faith against evils and falsities; and because his mind is then in truths, when he conquers he confirms himself in them and implants them; and also accounts as an enemy, 
and rejects from himself, the evils and falsities which have assailed him. Moreover through Temptations the concupiscences which are of the loves of self and of the world are subdued, and the man becomes 
humble. Thus he is rendered fit to receive the life of heaven from the Lord, which life is the new life, such as belongs to the regenerated man. </p>

Temptations lead to stronger belief in the truths of faith, also to the implantation of them in a person, and their insinuation into the workings of his will, so that they become forms of the good of 
charity. For as stated already, a person employs the truths of faith when fighting against evils and falsities; and since during that conflict his mind is intent on truths, when he is victorious he strengthens 
his belief in them and implants them within himself. At the same time he regards as his enemy the evils and falsities which have made the attack, and casts them away from himself. Temptations 
also serve to subdue the cravings of self-love and love of the world and to make a person humble. That is, they serve to fit him to receive the life of heaven from the Lord, that life being the new 
life such as one who has been regenerated possesses. </p>

</p><b>8966.</b>
Tentationes conducunt ad confirmanda vera fidei, tum ad implantanda illa, et ad insinuanda in voluntatem, ut fiant bona charitatis; homo enim, ut prius dictum est, pugnat ex veris fidei contra mala 
et falsa, et quia tunc mens ejus est in veris, cum vincit, confirmat se in illis ac implantat ea; et quoque mala et falsa quae impugnarunt, pro hoste habet et a se rejicit.  Per tentationes etiam concupiscentiae, 
quae sunt amorum sui et mundi, domantur, et homo humiliatur; ita aptus (x)redditur ad {1}recipiendum vitam caeli a Domino, quae vita est vita nova qualis est regenerato. @1 recipiendam$ </p>
