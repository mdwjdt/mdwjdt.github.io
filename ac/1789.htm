<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1789节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1789.</strong>“必大大地赏赐你”表胜利的目的或意图。这从“赏赐”的含义清楚可知，“赏赐”是指随试探的争战而来的奖赏，此处是指胜利的目的。因为主从不为自己寻求胜利的奖赏。祂胜利的奖赏就是全人类的救赎。正是出于对全人类的爱，祂才会争战。凡出于这爱争战的，都不会为自己要求奖赏。因为这爱具有这样的性质：它愿意将自己所有的给予和让与其他人，而自己一无所求。所以，这里的“赏赐”是指全人类的救赎。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1789.</strong> Your great reward symbolizes the goal of his victories. This can be seen from the symbolism of a reward as the prize that follows one's inward struggles. Here it symbolizes the goal of the Lord's victories, because he never sought any victory prize for himself. The reward of his victories was the salvation of the whole human race, and he fought out of love for the whole human race. No one who fights from this love demands any self-benefiting reward, because such a love by its very nature wants to give everything it has to others for their own and to keep nothing for itself. The salvation of the entire human race, then, is symbolized here by the reward. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1789</b></p><p><b>1789.</b>
Thy great reward. That this signifies the end and purpose of the victories, is evident from the signification of "reward," as being the prize after the combats of temptations; here the end and purpose 
of the victories, because the Lord never looked for any prize of victory for Himself. His prize of victories was the salvation of the whole human race; and it was from love toward the entire human race 
that He fought. He who fights from this love demands for himself no prize, because this love is such that it wills to give and transfer all its own to others, and to have nothing for itself; so that 
it is the salvation of the whole human race that is here signified by the "reward." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1789</b></p><p><b>1789.</b>
'Your great reward' means the end in view realized in victories. This is clear from the meaning of 'reward' as the prize following conflicts brought about by temptations - here the end in view realized 
in victories, for the Lord never looked for any prize of victory for Himself. His prize of victories was the salvation of the whole human race. It was out of love towards the whole human race that 
He fought. When anyone fights out of that love he demands no prize for himself, since that love is such as wishes to give away and impart to others all that is its own, and to have nothing for itself. 
Consequently it is the salvation of the whole human race that is meant here by 'reward'. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1789</b>
</p><b>1789.</b>
'Merces tua magna':  quod significet finem victoriarum, constat a significatione 'mercedis' quod sit praemium post pugnas tentationum, hic finis victoriarum, quia Dominus nusquam aliquod praemium victoriae 
pro se exspectavit; praemium victoriarum Ipsius fuit salus universi generis humani; ex amore erga universum genus humanum pugnavit; qui ex amore hoc pugnat, sibi non aliquod praemium poscit, quia 
amor ille est talis ut omnia sui dare et transferre </p>
