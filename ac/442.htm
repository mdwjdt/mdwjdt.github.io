<p><strong>[NCE]442.</strong> From evidence given in this chapter it is clear that in the earliest era there were many theologies developed outside the church, and many heresies, each of which had its own name. The thinking behind these independent theologies and heresies was much more profound than in modern times because the people of the time were by nature deep thinkers. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 442</b></p><p><b>442.</b>
From the contents of this chapter as above explained, it is evident that in the most ancient time there were many doctrines and heresies separate from the church, each one of which had its name, which 
separate doctrines and heresies were the outcome of much more profound thought than any at the present day, because such was the genius of the men of that time. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 442</b></p><p><b>442.</b>
From all that has been shown in this chapter it is evident that during the most ancient period there were several doctrinal systems separated from the Church, and heresies too, each one of them having 
a name of its own. These separated doctrinal systems and heresies were far more profound in their thought than any today, because people's innate disposition was such at that time.  </p>

Ex his quae in hoc capite ostensa sunt, patet quod antiquissimo tempore fuerint plures doctrinae separatae ab Ecclesia et haereses, quarum unaquaevis suam nomen habuit; quae doctrinae separatae et haereses 
fuerunt multo profundioris cogitationis quam hodie, quia tali genio fuerunt. </p>
