<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10452节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10452</strong>.“这版是两面写的，它们写在这面和那面”表通过它，主与人类结合，或天堂与世界结合。这从刻有律法的“版”的含义清楚可知：刻有律法的“版”是指整体上的圣言，如刚才所述（<a href="10451.htm">10451</a>节）。“两面写，写在这面和那面”表示主与人类的结合（参看<a href="9416.htm">9416</a>，<a href="10375.htm">10375</a>节的解释）。这也解释了为何这些版被称为“约版”，因为“约”表示结合（<a href="665.htm">665</a>，<a href="666.htm">666</a>，<a href="1023.htm">1023</a>，<a href="1864.htm">1864</a>，<a href="1996.htm">1996</a>，<a href="2003.htm">2003</a>，<a href="2021.htm">2021</a>，<a href="6804.htm">6804</a>，<a href="8767.htm">8767</a>，<a href="8778.htm">8778</a>，<a href="9396.htm">9396</a>节）。<br />由于此处论述的是通过圣言主与人类的结合，或天堂与世界的结合，所以必须阐明这究竟是什么情况。那些不了解圣言的真正性质的人绝无可能相信通过圣言，主与人类结合，天堂与世界结合；那些藐视圣言，或认为圣言毫无价值的人更不相信。要让这些人知道，天堂通过神性真理保持存在，没有这真理，它们就不是天堂，人类则通过天堂保持存在。因为除非天堂流入与人同在，否则人根本不能思考任何东西，因而不能理性地意愿任何东西。因此，为使天堂能保持存在，人类通过与天堂结合而保持存在，主为天堂里的天使和世界上的人提供了有神性真理在其中的圣言。因为就其属灵和属天意义而言，圣言具有这样的性质：它在如此至高的程度上包含天使的智慧本身在里面，以致一个人几乎无法对它的崇高性质形成任何概念，尽管它在字面上显得极其简单和粗糙。<br />由此明显可知，当一个人阅读圣言时，天堂就享有它从圣言所获得的智慧，同时此人与天堂结合。这样一部圣言就是为这个目的而被赐予人类的。由此可推知，如果世界上没有这种结合的媒介或手段，那么与天堂的结合就会消失，存在于一个人意愿中的一切良善和存在于他的理解力中的一切真理也随着这种结合而消失，与这些一同消失的还有能将人与人联系在一起的基本人性。因此，邪恶和虚假就会占据一切，社群由此一个接一个被毁灭。这就像当一个人在幽暗中行走，无论走到哪里都会绊倒时的情形；又像当头脑错乱，结果身体行动愚蠢、疯狂，甚至导致自我毁灭时的情形；或像当心脏衰弱，导致内脏器官和身体部位不再履行自己的功能，直至整个身体死亡时的情形。<br />如果天堂不与人结合，这就是人的状态；如果圣言不存在，或神性真理不像古代那样直接通过天使传达给他，天堂就不会与他结合。当提到“天堂”一词时，也要理解为神性；因为主的神性构成天堂。因此，与天堂结合就是与主结合；与天堂分离就是与主分离；与主分离就是毁灭。因为被称为天意的事物向善的整个秩序或排列都是从那里产生的；当天意被夺走时，一切事物都会迅速恶化，走向毁灭。由此清楚看出圣言究竟有什么用；只是很少有人相信圣言具有这种性质，并且具有如此伟大的功用！</p>

The tables were written on the two crossings, hereupon and hereupon were they written. That this signifies whereby there is the conjunction of the Lord with the human race, or of heaven with the world, 
is evident from the signification of "the tables upon which the law was written," as being the Word in the whole complex (of which just above, n. 10451). That the writing was "on the two crossings, 
hereupon and hereupon," signifies the conjunction of the Lord with the human race (as you will see unfolded in n. 9416, 10375); wherefore also these tables were called "the tables of the covenant," for 
"covenant" denotes conjunction (n. 665, 666, 1023, 1864, 1996, 2003, 2021, 6804, 8767, 8778, 9396).  [2] As the conjunction of the Lord with the human race by means of the Word is here spoken of, 
or that of heaven with the world, it must be told how the case is with regard to this. They who do not know the nature of the Word, cannot possibly believe that by means of it there is a conjunction of 
the Lord with the human race, and of heaven with the world; and still less they who despise the Word, or make no account of it. But let them know that the heavens subsist by means of Divine truth, and 
that without it there would be no heavens, and that the human race subsists by means of heaven; for unless heaven flowed in with man, man would not be able to think at all, thus not to will anything 
rationally. In order therefore that heaven may subsist, and the human race by conjunction with it, the Word has been provided by the Lord, wherein is Divine truth for angels and for men, the Word in 
its spiritual and celestial sense being of such a nature as to contain within it angelic wisdom itself in so surpassing a degree that it is scarcely possible for a man to form any conception of its excellence, 
although in the letter it appears very simple and unpolished.  [3] From this it is evident that heaven is in its wisdom from the Word when it is being read by man, and then at the same time 
the man is in conjunction with heaven. To this end has such a Word been given to man. From this it follows that if this medium of conjunction were not in the world, conjunction with heaven would perish, 
and with this conjunction all good of the will and all truth of the understanding in man, and with these that very humanity which consociates man with man; consequently evil and falsity would be 
in full possession, whereby one society would perish after another. For it would be as when a man walks in thick darkness and stumbles wherever he goes; and it would be as when the head is in a delirium, 
in consequence of which the body is carried madly and insanely even to its destruction; and it would be as when the heart fails, causing the organs and members to cease to perform their uses, until 
the whole body dies. [4] Such would be the state of man unless heaven were conjoined with him, and heaven would not be conjoined with him unless there were the Word; or unless Divine truth were communicated 
immediately through angels, as in ancient times. When heaven is mentioned, the Divine also is meant, for the Divine of the Lord makes heaven; so that to be conjoined with heaven is to be conjoined 
with the Lord; and to be disjoined from heaven is to be disjoined from the Lord; and to be disjoined from the Lord is to perish; for the whole disposal of things for good, which is called Providence, 
is from this source; and were such disposal removed, all things would rush into evil, and so into devastation. From all this it can be seen what is the use of the Word; but few will believe that 
the Word is of such a nature and of so great a use. </p>

'The tablets were written on across them both, from the edge of one and from the edge of the other they were written on' means through which the Lord was joined to the human race, or heaven to the world. 
This is clear from the meaning of 'the tablets on which the Law had been inscribed' as the Word in its entirety, dealt with immediately above in <a href="10451.htm">10451</a>. As regards the writing extending across both 
sides, from one edge and from the other, that this means the Lord's being joined to the human race, see the explanation in <a href="9416.htm">9416</a>, <a href="10375.htm">10375</a>. This also explains why those tablets were called the tablets of 
the covenant, for 'a covenant' means a joining together, <a href="665.htm">665</a>, <a href="666.htm">666</a>, <a href="1023.htm">1023</a>, <a href="1864.htm">1864</a>, <a href="1996.htm">1996</a>, <a href="2003.htm">2003</a>, <a href="2021.htm">2021</a>, <a href="6804.htm">6804</a>, <a href="8767.htm">8767</a>, <a href="8778.htm">8778</a>, <a href="9396.htm">9396</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Since the Lord's being joined to the human race or heaven to the world 
through the Word is spoken of here, what this really is must be stated. Those who have no knowledge of the true nature of the Word cannot possibly believe that through it the Lord is joined to the human 
race, and heaven to the world; less still can those who spurn the Word or think it is worthless believe it. But let such people know that the heavens are kept in being through Divine Truth and that 
without that Truth they would not be heavens, and that the human race is kept in being through heaven. For unless heaven were flowing in to be present with a person no person could even begin to think 
or therefore desire anything in a rational manner. In order therefore that heaven may be kept in being, and the human race by being joined to it, the Lord has provided the Word, in which there is 
Divine Truth for angels in heaven and for people in the world. For the nature of the Word in its spiritual and celestial senses is such that they hold angelic wisdom itself within them, in a so highly 
exalted degree that a person can have scarcely any notion of its exalted nature, though in the letter it appears to be exceedingly simple and crude.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From all this it is evident that when a person 
reads the Word heaven has the enjoyment of the wisdom it derives from the Word, and that at the same time the person is joined to heaven. This is the end for which such a Word has been given to mankind. 
From this it follows that if this means of joining together did not exist in the world the connection with heaven would perish, and with it all the good present in a person's will and all the 
truth in his understanding, and with these that essential human quality which enables one person to live in a community with another. Consequently evil and falsity would take possession of everything, 
as a result of which one community after another would be destroyed. For the situation would be like that when a person moves about in thick darkness and stumbles wherever he goes. It would be like that 
when the head is deranged and the body consequently behaves in a foolish and insane manner that leads to self-destruction. Or it would be like that when the heart is weak and internal organs and members 
consequently cease performing their functions until the whole is dead.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 This is what the condition of the human being would be if heaven were not joined to him; and heaven would not be joined 
to him if the Word did not exist, or else Divine Truth were not conveyed to him directly through angels, as it had been in ancient times. When the word 'heaven' is used that which is Divine should 
also be understood; for that which is Divine and the Lord's composes heaven. Thus being joined to heaven entails being joined to the Lord, and being separated from heaven entails being separated from 
the Lord; and being separated from the Lord entails destruction. For all ordering of things for good, which is called Providence, arises from there; and when Providence is taken away everything quickly 
deteriorates and goes to ruin. From all this it becomes clear what purpose the Word serves; but few will believe that the Word serves so great a purpose as that described above.  </p>

`Tabulae scriptae a duobus transitibus, exhinc et exhinc illae scriptae': quod significet per quod conjunctio Domini cum humano genere, seu caeli cum mundo, constat ex significatione `tabularum quibus 
lex inscripta' quod sint Verbum in omni complexu, de qua nunc supra n. 10,451; quod `scriptura a duobus transitibus, exhinc et exhinc' significet conjunctionem Domini cum humano genere, explicatum 
videas, n. 9416, 10,375, ideo quoque tabulae illae dictae fuerunt tabulae foederis, `foedus' enim est conjunctio, n. 665, 666, 1023, 1864, 1996, 2003, 2021, 6804, 8767, 8778, 9396. 	[2] Quia hic dicitur 
conjunctio Domini cum humano genere, seu caeli cum mundo, per Verbum, dicendum est quomodo cum hoc se habet: qui non sciunt quale Verbum est, illi nequaquam credere possunt quod per id sit conjunctio 
Domini cum humano genere, ac caeli cum {1}mundo; ac minus adhuc illi qui Verbum contemnunt, aut nihili faciunt; sed sciant quod caeli subsistant per Divinum Verum, et quod absque illo non caeli forent, 
et quod humanum genus subsistat per caelum; nam nisi hoc influeret apud hominem, homo {2}non hilum potuisset cogitare, ita nec aliquid rationaliter velle; ut itaque subsistat caelum, et ex conjunctione 
cum illo humanum genus, provisum est a Domino Verbum, in quo est Divinum Verum pro angelis et pro hominibus; tale enim est Verbum in sensu suo spirituali et caelesti, ut inibi sit ipsa sapientia 
angelica, in tam supereminenti gradu ut vix cogitari possit ab homine aliquid quoad quale eminentiae ejus, tametsi in littera per quam simplex et rude appareat; [3] inde patet quod caelum in sapientia 
sua sit ex   Verbo cum id legitur ab homine, et simul tunc homo in conjunctione  cum caelo; ob hunc finem datum est homini tale Verbum; inde sequitur, si hoc medium conjunctionis non in mundo {3}esset, 
quod periret conjunctio cum caelo, et cum conjunctione omne bonum voluntatis et verum intellectus apud hominem, et cum his ipsum illud (d)humanum, quod consociat hominem cum homine; inde malum et 
falsum occuparent omnia, ex quibus societas una post alteram interiret; foret enim sicut cum homo vadit in caligine, (c)ac ubivis impingit, (c)et foret sicut cum caput {4}delirat, unde corpus fertur 
dementer et (x)insane usque in sui perniciem, (c)ac foret sicut cum languet cor, unde viscera et membra desistunt agere suos usus, usque dum emoritur totum; [4] talis foret status   hominis nisi caelum 
ei conjunctum esset, ac caelum ei non conjunctum esset si non foret Verbum, aut nisi Divinum Verum communicaretur {5} immediate per angelos, ut antiquis temporibus; cum dicitur caelum, intelligitur 
etiam Divinum, nam Divinum Domini facit caelum; ita conjungi cum caelo est conjungi cum Domino, ac disjungi a caelo est disjungi a Domino, ac disjungi a Domino est perire; omnis enim dispositio in bonum, 
quae vocatur Providentia, inde est qua remota ruunt omnia in malum, et sic in devastationem. Ex his constare potest cui usui est Verbum; sed quod Verbum talis ac tanti usus sit, pauci credituri sunt. @1
