<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5605节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5605.</strong>“我们就起身去，好叫我们，都得存活，不至于死”表照着层级所进入的属灵生命。这从“起身”、“去”、“存活”、“不至于死”的含义清楚可知：“起身”是指上升到更高层或内层事物，因而上升到构成属灵生命的事物那里（参看<a href="2401.htm">2401</a>，<a href="2785.htm">2785</a>，<a href="2912.htm">2912</a>，<a href="2927.htm">2927</a>，<a href="3171.htm">3171</a>，<a href="4103.htm">4103</a>，<a href="4881.htm">4881</a>节）；“去”是指存活（<a href="3335.htm">3335</a>，<a href="3690.htm">3690</a>，<a href="4882.htm">4882</a>，<a href="5493.htm">5493</a>节），由于“去”之后“我们都得存活”，故“去”表示属灵生命的最初阶段或最早阶段；“存活”是指属灵生命，因为就圣言的内义而言，所指的不是其它生命；“不至于死”是指不再定罪，也就是从定罪的状态走出来，因为就圣言的内义而言，所表示的是属灵死亡，即定罪，而非其它。由此明显可知，“我们就起身去，好叫我们，都得存活，不至于死”表示照着层级的生命。也就是说，“起身”表示生命的引入阶段，“去”表示那生命的最初或最早阶段，“存活”表示生命本身或完全的生命，“不至于死”表示从没有生命的事物中被引离出来。<br />“去”在内义上表示存活，这个观念在丝毫不知道属灵生命的人看来似乎很奇怪。“起行”（travelling on）和“寄居”（sojourning）也一样，“起行”表示生活的次序和进一步的生活阶段（<a href="1293.htm">1293</a>，<a href="4375.htm">4375</a>，<a href="4554.htm">4554</a>，<a href="4585.htm">4585</a>节）；“寄居”表示接受教导并照之生活（<a href="1463.htm">1463</a>，<a href="2025.htm">2025</a>，<a href="3672.htm">3672</a>节）。诚然，“去”（go）、“起行”和“寄居”具有这些含义的原因能被告知，但这原因具有这种性质：它对那些不知道来世人们动作性质的人来说没什么意义，几乎不被他们接受。那里的动作和前进不是别的，因为它们没有其它源头，唯源于生命状态的变化。这些变化在外在行为上极像从一个地方挪到另一个地方。这一事实通过来世的大量经历向我证明；在来世，我在灵里行走，在他们中间，走过他们许多的居所；我在如此行走时，我的肉体却一直留在原处。我还与他们谈论了这是怎么回事，获知正是生命状态的变化制造了灵界的前进。<br />这一点也通过以下事实向我证明：灵人能通过所产生的状态变化出现在某个高处，然后一瞬间在某个低处，或在遥远的西方，然后一瞬间又在东方等等。但如前所述，这一点在丝毫不知道灵界生命的人看来必显得很奇怪。因为灵界没有空间或时间，取而代之的是生命的状态。这些状态外在会产生前进和动作这一活生生的表象。这种表象如此鲜活和真实，以致生命本身似乎就在我们里面，因而是我们自己的；而事实上，生命是从主流入的，主是一切生命的源头（参看<a href="2021.htm">2021</a>，<a href="2658.htm">2658</a>，<a href="2706.htm">2706</a>，<a href="2886.htm">2886</a>-<a href="2888.htm">2888</a>，<a href="3001.htm">3001</a>，<a href="3318.htm">3318</a>，<a href="3337.htm">3337</a>-<a href="3338.htm">3338</a>，<a href="3484.htm">3484</a>，<a href="3619.htm">3619</a>，<a href="3741.htm">3741</a>-<a href="3743.htm">3743</a>，<a href="4151.htm">4151</a>，<a href="4249.htm">4249</a>，<a href="4318.htm">4318</a>-<a href="4320.htm">4320</a>，<a href="4417.htm">4417</a>，<a href="4523.htm">4523</a>，<a href="4524.htm">4524</a>，<a href="4882.htm">4882</a>节）。由于“去”（going）和“动作”（moving）表示存活，所以古人说“我们生活、动作、存留，都在乎神”（使徒行传<a href="http://39-27.cn/徒17.28.htm">17:28</a>）。他们以“动作”来表示生命的外在，以“生活”来表示生命的内在，以“存留”来表示它的至内在。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5605</b></p><p><b>5605.</b>
And we will arise and go, and we will live, and not die. That this signifies spiritual life according to degrees, is evident from the signification of "arising," as being elevation to higher or interior 
things, consequently to the things of spiritual life (see n. 2401, 2785, 2912, 2927, 3171, 4103, 4881); from the signification of "going," as being to live (n. 3335, 3690, 4882, 5493), and as the 
words follow "and we will live," "going" signifies the first spiritual life; from the signification of "living," as being spiritual life, for no other life is meant in the internal sense of the Word; 
and from the signification of "not dying," as being no longer to be damned, that is, to be out of a state of damnation, for in the internal sense of the Word no other than spiritual death is meant, which 
is damnation. From this it is plain that by "we will arise and go, and we will live and not die" is signified life according to degrees; namely, introduction into life by "arising," the first of life 
by "going," life itself by "living," and being led out from the things of no life by "not dying."  [2] That "to go" in the internal sense is to live, seems strange to him who knows nothing about 
spiritual life; but it is like "journeying," which denotes the order of life and what is successive of life (n. 1293, 4375, 4554, 4585), and like "sojourning," which denotes to be instructed and to live 
accordingly (n. 1463, 2025, 3672). The reason why "going," "journeying," and "sojourning" have these significations might indeed be told, but the reason is of such a nature as could scarcely be accepted 
by those who are ignorant of the nature of movements in the other life. Movements and progressions there are nothing else-because from no other source-than changes of the state of life. These changes 
appear in externals exactly like progressions from place to place. That this is so can be confirmed by much experience in the other life; for I have walked there in spirit with them and among them, 
through many of their abodes, and this though in body I remained in the same place. I have also talked with them as to how this could be, and have been informed that it is the changes of the state 
of life that make progressions in the spiritual world. [3] This was also confirmed by the fact that by means of changes induced on their states, spirits can appear on high, and then in a moment beneath, 
or now far to the west, and in a moment to the east, and so on. But as before said this cannot but seem strange to him who knows nothing about life in the spiritual world; for there are no spaces 
or times there, but states of life instead. These states produce in externals a most living appearance of progressions and motions. The appearance is as living and real as that life itself is in us and 
therefore our own, when yet life flows in from the Lord, who is the fountain of all life (see n. 2021, 2658, 2706, 2886-2888, 3001, 3318, 3337-3338, 3484, 3619, 3741-3743, 4151, 4249, 4318-4320, 4417, 
4523, 4524, 4882). As "going" and "moving" signify living, it was therefore said by the ancients, that "in God we move, live, and have our being" [Acts 17:28]; and by "moving" they meant the external 
of life, by "living" its internal, and by "being" its inmost. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5605</b></p><p><b>5605.</b>
'And we will rise up and go, and we will live and not die' means spiritual life entered into by degrees. This is clear from the meaning of 'rising up' as a raising up to higher or more internal things, 
and therefore to those that constitute spiritual life, dealt with in <a href="2401.htm">2401</a>, <a href="2785.htm">2785</a>, <a href="2912.htm">2912</a>, <a href="2927.htm">2927</a>, <a href="3171.htm">3171</a>, <a href="4103.htm">4103</a>, <a href="4881.htm">4881</a>; from the meaning of 'going' as living, dealt with in <a href="3335.htm">3335</a>, <a href="3690.htm">3690</a>, <a href="4882.htm">4882</a>, <a href="5493.htm">5493</a> (and since 
'and we will live' follows, 'going' means the earliest stage of spiritual life); from the meaning of 'living' as spiritual life, for no other kind of life is meant in the internal sense of the Word; 
and from the meaning of 'not dying' as standing condemned no longer, that is, standing outside a state of condemnation, for no other kind of death is meant in the internal sense of the Word than spiritual 
death, which is condemnation. From all this it is evident that 'we will rise up and go, and we will live and not die' means life entered into by degrees. That is to say, an introductory phase leading 
into life is meant by 'rising up', the earliest stage of that life by 'going', that life fully under way by 'living', and guidance away from everything alien to that life by 'not dying'.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
The idea that living is meant in the internal sense by 'going' will seem strange to one who does not know anything about spiritual life. But much the same is involved here as with the expression 'travelling 
on', namely an ordered life and a further stage of life, <a href="1293.htm">1293</a>, <a href="4375.htm">4375</a>, <a href="4554.htm">4554</a>, <a href="4585.htm">4585</a>; receiving instruction and leading a life in keeping with it, <a href="1463.htm">1463</a>, <a href="2025.htm">2025</a>, <a href="3672.htm">3672</a>. The reason why 'going', 'travelling 
on', and 'sojourning' have these meanings can, it is true, be stated; yet it is the kind of reason that makes little sense to those who have no knowledge of the exact nature of people's movements in 
the next life. Moving about and advancements made by people there are nothing else, since they have no other origin, than changes in their states of life. Such changes present themselves in outward 
actions as nothing other than advances from one place to another. The truth of this has been proved to me from many an experience I have had in the next life. In my spirit I have walked with and among 
those there, and have moved through their many dwelling-places; and I have done so even though my body remained all the time in the same place. I have talked to them about how this could be so and have 
learned that changes in their states of life are what constitute the advances people make in the spiritual world. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The same has also been proved to me by the fact that spirits are able, through 
changes of state that are effected, to be somewhere high up and then in an instant somewhere deep down, or to be far away in the west and then in an instant in the east, and so on. But, as stated, 
this is bound to seem strange to someone who does not know anything about life in the spiritual world. For in that world no intervals of space or of time exist, but states of life instead of these. Such 
states produce externally a visible scene with all the appearance of life involving advances and movement. The scene that appears is so vivid and real that it is an appearance of life itself; that 
is to say, the appearance is that life exists inherently within us, and so is essentially our own, when in actual fact life flows into us from the Lord, the source from which all life involves much the 
same, namely and the expression 'sojourning springs, see <a href="2021.htm">2021</a>, <a href="2658.htm">2658</a>, <a href="2706.htm">2706</a>, <a href="2886.htm">2886</a>-<a href="2888.htm">2888</a>, <a href="3001.htm">3001</a>, <a href="3318.htm">3318</a>, <a href="3337.htm">3337</a>, <a href="3338.htm">3338</a>, <a href="3484.htm">3484</a>, <a href="3619.htm">3619</a>, <a href="3741.htm">3741</a>-<a href="3743.htm">3743</a>, <a href="4151.htm">4151</a>, <a href="4249.htm">4249</a>, <a href="4318.htm">4318</a>-<a href="4320.htm">4320</a>, <a href="4417.htm">4417</a>, <a href="4523.htm">4523</a>, <a href="4524.htm">4524</a>, <a href="4882.htm">4882</a>. Because 'going' and 
'moving' mean living, the ancients had the saying, In God we move, and live, and have our being. By 'moving' they meant the external degree of life, by 'living' the internal degree, and by 'having one's 
being' the inmost degree. </p>

</p><b>5605.</b>
`Et surgemus, et ibimus, et vivemus, et non moriemur': quod significet vitam spiritualem secundum gradus, constat a significatione `surgere' quod sit elevatio ad superiora seu interiora, proinde ad 
illa quae sunt vitae spiritualis, de qua n. 2401, 2785,2912, 2927, 3171, 4103, 4881; a significatione `ire' quod sit vivere, de qua n. 333513690,4882, 5493, et quia sequitur `et vivemus', ire significat 
primam vitam spiritualem; ex significatione `vivere' quod sit vita spiritualis, non enim alia vita in sensu interno Verbi intelligitur; et ex significatione `non mori' quod sit non amplius damnari, 
seu extra statum damnationis esse, {1}nam non alia mors in sensu interno Verbi quam mors spiritualis quae est damnatio, intelligitur; inde patet quod per `surgemus, et ibimus, et vivemus, et non moriemur' 
significetur vita secundum gradus, nempe introductio ad vitam per `surgere', primum vitae per `ire', ipsa vita per `vivere', eductio ab illis quae non vitae per `non mori'.  [2](S)Quod `ire' in 
sensu interno sit  vivere, apparet ei qui non de vita spirituali aliquid novit, alienum; sed hoc similiter se habet sicut `proficisci', quod sit vitae ordo et vitae successivum, n. 1293, 4375, 4554, 4585, 
et sicut `peregrinari' quod sit instrui et secundum id vivere, n. 1463, 2025, 3672; dici {2}`quidem' potest causa cur `ire, proficisci, et peregrinari' illa significant, sed causa est talis ut vix 
recipi possit ab illis qui non sciunt quomodo cum motibus in altera vita se habet; motus ibi et progressiones non aliud sunt, quia non aliunde, quam mutationes status vitae; hae mutationes apparent 
in externis prorsus sicut progressiones a loco in locum; quod ita sit, a multa experientia ex altera vita confirmari potest; ambulavi enim ibi in spiritu cum illis et inter illos, per eorum plures mansiones, 
et hoc tametsi quoad corpus mansissem in eodem loco; et quoque locutus sum cum illis quomodo id posset fieri, et instructus quod sint mutationes status vitae, quae in mundo spirituali faciunt 
progressiones; [3] quod etiam confirmabatur per id quod spiritus per mutationes status inductas, possint sisti in alto, et momento in profundo, tum longe in occidente, et momento in oriente, et sic porro; 
sed, ut dictum, hoc non potest non ut alienum apparere ei qui non de vita in mundo spirituali aliquid novit; sunt enim ibi non spatia nec tempora sed pro illis sunt status vitae; hi status in externis 
producunt apparentiam prorsus vivam progressionum et motuum; apparentia illa est tam viva et realis sicut est apparentia ipsius vitae, nempe quod vita sit in nobis, ac ita nostra, cum tamen vita 
influit a Domino Qui est fons unde omne vitae, videatur n. 2021, 2658, 2706, 2886-2888, 3001,3318,3337,3338,3484,3619,3741-3743, 415I, 4249,4318-4320, 4417, 4523, 4524, 4882.   Quia `ire et moveri' significant 
vivere, ideo ab antiquis dictum fuit quod {3}`in Deo moveamur, vivamus, et simus', et per `moveri' intellectum externum vitae, per `vivere' internum ejus, et per `esse' intimum. @1 nec$ @2
