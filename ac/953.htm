<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>953.</strong>我被引领穿过第一层天堂的某些居所，从那里得以看到远方波涛汹涌的大海，一眼望不到边。我被告知，那些在世时渴望变得伟大，并且为了确保自己的荣耀和名声而不择手段的人，就有这样的幻象，看到这样的海，他们非常害怕被淹没在这大海中。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]953.</strong> I was led through certain settlements of the first heaven, from which I had the opportunity to see a vast, distant sea, heaving with massive waves and stretching to an unseen shore. The people who fantasize such things and see a body of water like this are afraid they will drown. I heard that they are the ones who aimed for worldly eminence, not caring whether they achieved it by fair means or foul as long as they could win glory for themselves. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 953</b></p><p><b>953.</b>
I was led through some abodes of the first heaven, from which I was permitted to see afar off a great sea swelling with mighty waves, the boundaries of which stretched beyond the range of vision, and 
I was told that those have such phantasies, and see such a sea, with fear of being sunk in it, who have desired to be great in the world, caring nothing whether by right or by wrong, provided they could 
secure their own glory and renown. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 953</b></p><p><b>953.</b>
I was conducted through certain dwelling-places of the first heaven, and from there I was allowed to see in the distance a vast sea heaving with large waves, stretching far out of sight. I was told that 
those on earth who have wished to be great, not caring at all whether they used fair means or foul so long as they gathered glory to themselves, have fantasies such as this and see a sea such as that 
in which they are afraid of being drowned. </p>

</p><b>953.</b>
Perductus sum per quasdam mansiones caeli primi, inde spectare mihi datum procul mare quoddam grande tumultuans cum magnis fluctibus ad quendam limitem non visum, et dicebatur quod ii tales phantasias 
habeant et tale mare videant cum timore ut immergantur, qui magni in orbe voluerint esse, nihil curantes num per fas aut nefas modo sibi gloriam comparare possint. </p>
