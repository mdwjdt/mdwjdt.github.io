<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3040节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3040.</strong>“你就可以从那里为我儿子娶一个妻子”表对真理的情感的确出自那里，但却出自一个新的源头。这从“妻子”的含义清楚可知，“妻子”是指对真理的情感，如前所述。因为本章所论述的“利百加”代表要与神圣理性良善，也就是以撒结合的神圣真理。对真理的情感就出自那里，也就是说，出自“父家和本族之地”所表示的事物，但却出自一个新的源头。这个问题尚未能充分解释清楚，不过，下文会有详述。我在此简单解释一下：在属世人里面，对真理的一切情感皆通过来自出于理性的对良善的情感的流注，即通过来自神性的理性而产生。通过该流注在属世人里面所产生的对真理的情感，起初并不是对纯正真理的情感。因为纯正的真理是逐步到来的，并逐步取代以前那些本身并非真理，不过是通向纯正真理之方法的事物。从这段简要解释可以明白，“对真理的情感的确出自那里，但却出自一个新的源头”这句话是什么意思。</p>

And thou shalt take a woman for my son from thence. That this signifies that the affection of truth was indeed thence, but from a new source, is evident from the signification of a "woman," as being 
the affection of truth (concerning which see above); for by Rebekah, of whom this chapter treats, is represented the Divine truth that was to be conjoined with the Divine good of the rational, which is 
"Isaac." That the affection of truth is thence, that is, from what is signified by the "house of the father" and the "land of nativity," but from a new source, cannot as yet be explained, but it is 
treated of in many things that follow. I may however briefly state that all the affection of truth in the natural man comes forth by an influx from the affection of good out of the rational, or through 
the rational from the Divine; the affection of truth which through this influx comes forth in the natural man is not in the beginning the affection of genuine truth; for genuine truth comes by successive 
steps, and is also by successive steps substituted in place of former things that were not in themselves truths, but only means leading to genuine truth. From these few words it may be seen what 
is meant by its being said that the affection of truth is indeed therefrom, but from a new source. </p>

'And you shall take a wife for my son from there' means that the affection for truth came indeed from there, yet from a new source. This is clear from the meaning of 'a wife' as the affection for truth, 
dealt with above. For 'Rebekah' who is referred to in this present chapter represents Divine Truth that was to be joined to the Divine Good of the Rational, which is Isaac. That the affection for 
truth comes from there, that is to say, from the things meant by 'father's house' and 'land of nativity', yet from a new source, cannot as yet be fully explained, though the matter is dealt with extensively 
in what follows. Let just a brief explanation be given here. Every affection for truth in the natural man comes into being through an influx from the affection for good from the rational, that 
is, from the Divine by way of the rational. The affection for truth which through that influx comes into being in the natural man is at first not an affection for genuine truth, for genuine truth arrives 
gradually. It gradually takes the place of those things previously there which were not truths in themselves, but only means leading on to genuine truth. This brief explanation shows what is meant 
by the statement that the affection for truth comes indeed from there, yet from a new source. </p>

</p><b>3040.</b>
Quod `accipies mulierem filio meo inde' significet quod affectio veri quidem inde sed ex ortu novo, constat ex significatione `mulieris' quod sit affectio veri, de qua supra; per `Rebeccam' enim de 
qua in hoc capite agitur, repraesentatur Divinum Verum quod conjungendum Divino Bono {1}Rationalis, quod est Jishakus; quod affectio veri sit inde, nempe ex illis quae significantur per `domum patris 
et terram nativitatis,' sed ex ortu novo, non adhuc explicari potest, in sequentibus de illa re multis agitur; ut modo paucis dicatur; omnis affectio veri in naturali homine, existit per influxum ab affectione 
boni e rationali, seu per rationale a Divino; affectio veri quae per influxum illum existit in naturali homine, principio non est affectio genuini veri, genuinum enim verum successive venit, 
et successive substituitur loco priorum, quae non fuerunt vera in se sed modo media ducentia ad verum genuinum; ex his paucis constare potest quid sit quod affectio veri quidem sit inde, sed ex ortu 
novo. @1 in Rationali$  </p>
