<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8495节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8495.</strong>“明天是向耶和华守的一个圣安息日”表良善和真理的永恒结合。这从“安息日”和“明天”的含义清楚可知：“安息日”是指良善和真理的结合，如下文所述；“明天”是指永恒（参看<a href="3998.htm">3998</a>节）。人若不知道安息日代表什么，因而表示什么，也就不可能知道为何它被视为至圣。它被视为至圣的原因是，它在至高意义上代表神性和神性人身在主里面的合一；在相对意义上代表主的神性人身与人类的结合。因此，安息日是最为神圣的。它因代表这些事，故也代表良善和真理的结合方面的天堂，这种结合被称为“天上的婚姻”。由于良善和真理的结合唯独通过主实现，丝毫不通过人实现，还由于它是在平安的状态下实现的，所以人们被严厉禁止在那一日作任何工。这个禁令如此严格，以致凡如此行的灵魂都要被剪除，如我们在摩西五经中所读到的：<br />你们要守安息日，因为它是你们的圣日。凡亵渎这日的，必被处死；凡在这日作工的，灵魂必从他百姓中间剪除。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出31.14.htm">31:14</a>）<br />这就是为何有一个人只是在安息日捡柴，就被人用石头打死（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.32.htm">15:32</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.36.htm">36</a>）。这也是为何关于安息日的诫命是十诫中的第三诫，紧跟在关于对耶和华的神圣敬拜的那两诫之后（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出20.8.htm">20:8</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申5.12.htm">5:12</a>）。因此，安息日被称为“永远的约”（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出31.16.htm">31:16</a>），因为“约”表示结合（<a href="665.htm">665</a>，<a href="666.htm">666</a>，<a href="1023.htm">1023</a>，<a href="1038.htm">1038</a>，<a href="1864.htm">1864</a>，<a href="1996.htm">1996</a>，<a href="2003.htm">2003</a>，<a href="2021.htm">2021</a>，<a href="6804.htm">6804</a>节）。<br />由此可见以下经文关于安息日所说的话在内义上表示什么，如在以赛亚书：<br />谨守安息日而不亵渎的人便为有福。耶和华如此说，那些谨守我的安息日，拣选我所喜悦的事，持守我约的太监，我必使他们在我殿中，在我墙内有一个地方，一个名号，比儿女更美好；我必赐他们永远的名，不能剪除；凡守安息日不亵渎、又持守我约的人，我必领他们到我的圣山，使他们在我的祷告殿中喜乐。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛56.2.htm">56:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛56.7.htm">7</a>）<br />由此明显可知，“谨守安息日为圣的人”是指那些与主结合的人。“在耶和华的殿中有比儿女更美好的一个地方，一个名号赐给他们，一个不能剪除的永远的名号”，他们被“领到圣山”表示他们必在天堂。<br />同一先知书：<br />你若在安息日掉转你的脚步，在我圣日不行你意，称安息日为快乐，称耶和华的圣日为可尊重的，而且尊敬这日，不行自己的路，不寻求自己的私欲，不说一句私话，你就以耶和华为乐。我要以雅各的产业养育你。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛58.13.htm">58:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛58.14.htm">14</a>）<br />“在安息日不做任何工”表示什么，这在此处是显而易见的，即：他们不可做始于自己的任何事，只能做始于主的事。因为在天堂，天使的状态是这样：他们不会意愿或去做，甚至思考或说出始于自己，或始于他们自己东西的任何事；他们与主的结合就在于此。当经上说他们不可行己意，也不可行自己的路、寻求自己的私欲、说一句私话时，所表示的是不去做始于他们自己的任何事。天使所具有的这种状态就是天上的状态本身；当他们处于这种状态时，就拥有平安和安息。主也有安息，因为当他们与祂结合时，他们不再劳碌；这时他们住在主里面。这些事由这些话来表示：你若称安息日为耶和华神圣的快乐，他们就会以耶和华为乐。在创世记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/创2.2.htm">2:2</a>），六日创造之后，主在第七日休息就表示祂的安息。<br />耶利米书中的这些话也表示这些事：<br />你们若留意听从我，在安息日不担什么担子进入这城的各门，只以安息日为圣日，在那日无论何工都不做，那时就有坐大卫宝座的君王和首领，他们和他们的首领，与犹大人并耶路撒冷的居民，或坐车，或骑马进入这城的各门。而且这城必永远有人居住。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶17.24.htm">17:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶17.25.htm">25</a>）<br />“在安息日做工”表示源于自我的一切；“坐大卫宝座的君王和首领或坐车，或骑马进入这城的各门”描述了那些被自我而非被主引导的人；“君王”表示信之真理；“首领”表示它们的首要事物；“坐大卫宝座”表示它们来自主；“车和马”表示信的教义和理性概念。要知道，来自人自我的一切皆为邪恶，来自主的一切皆为良善。对那些被主引导的人来说，一切事物，直至其理解力和意愿的生命的最小粒子，因而直至他们所拥有的信和仁的每一个部分，都是流入的；对此，可参看前面通过经历所作的大量说明（<a href="2886.htm">2886</a>-<a href="2888.htm">2888</a>，<a href="6053.htm">6053</a>-<a href="6058.htm">6058</a>，<a href="6189.htm">6189</a>-<a href="6215.htm">6215</a>，<a href="6307.htm">6307</a>-<a href="6327.htm">6327</a>，<a href="6466.htm">6466</a>-<a href="6495.htm">6495</a>，<a href="6598.htm">6598</a>-<a href="6626.htm">6626</a>，<a href="6982.htm">6982</a>，<a href="6985.htm">6985</a>，<a href="6996.htm">6996</a>，<a href="7004.htm">7004</a>，<a href="7055.htm">7055</a>，<a href="7056.htm">7056</a>，<a href="7058.htm">7058</a>，<a href="7147.htm">7147</a>，<a href="7270.htm">7270</a>节）。<br />安息日是主与人类结合的代表，这一点明显可见于以西结书：<br />我将我的安息日赐给他们，好在我与他们中间为证据，使他们承认我耶和华是叫他们成为圣的。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结20.12.htm">20:12</a>；以及出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出31.13.htm">31:13</a>）<br />因此，在安息日生火也是不可以的（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出35.3.htm">35:3</a>），因为“火”表示构成生命的一切；“生火”表示构成始于自我的生命之物。综上所述，明显可知，主是“安息日的主”，正如主在马太福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.1.htm">12:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.8.htm">8</a>）中所说的；还明显可知为何主在安息日医治了许多人（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.10.htm">12:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.13.htm">13</a>马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可3.1.htm">3:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可3.8.htm">8</a>路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路6.6.htm">6:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路6.11.htm">11</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.10.htm">13:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.17.htm">17</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路14.1.htm">14:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路14.6.htm">6</a>；约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.9.htm">5:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.18.htm">18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约7.22.htm">7:22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约7.23.htm">23</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约9.14.htm">9:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约9.16.htm">16</a>）；因为主为人们所医治的疾病涉及由于邪恶而存在的属灵疾病（参看<a href="7337.htm">7337</a>，<a href="8364.htm">8364</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8495</b></p><p><b>8495.</b>
A Sabbath holy to Jehovah is the morrow. That this signifies the conjunction of good and truth to eternity, is evident from the signification of "the Sabbath," as being the conjunction of good and truth 
(of which below); and from the signification of "the morrow," as being to eternity (see n. 3998). He who does not know what the Sabbath represented, and thus what it signified, cannot know why it 
was accounted the most holy of all things. But the reason why it was accounted most holy was that in the supreme sense it represented the union of the Divine and the Divine Human in the Lord; and in the 
relative sense the conjunction of the Divine Human of the Lord with the human race. Consequently the Sabbath was most holy. And because it represented these things, it also represented heaven in respect 
to the conjunction of good and truth, which conjunction is called "the heavenly marriage." And as the conjunction of good and truth is effected by the Lord alone, and nothing of it by man, and as 
it is effected in a state of peace, therefore it was most severely forbidden that man should then do any work, insomuch that the soul which did this was to be cut off, as we read in Moses: </p>
<p>     Ye 
shall keep the Sabbath, because it is holy to you; he that profaneth it, dying shall die; for whosoever doeth work therein, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of his people (Exod. 31:14). Therefore 
one was stoned who merely picked up sticks on that day (Num. 15:32-36). Therefore also the commandment concerning the Sabbath is the third commandment in the Decalogue, immediately following the 
two concerning the holy worship of Jehovah (Exod. 20:8; Deut. 5:12). And therefore the Sabbath is called "an eternal covenant" (Exod. 31:16), for by "covenant" is signified conjunction (n. 665, 666, 
1023, 1038, 1864, 1996, 2003, 2021, 6804).  [2] From all this it can now be seen what is meant in the internal sense by the things said in the following passages about the Sabbath; as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>   
  Blessed is the man who keepeth the Sabbath, that he profane it not; thus said Jehovah to the eunuchs who keep My Sabbaths, and choose that in which I delight, and take hold of My covenant, I will give 
them in My house and within My walls a place and a name, better than sons and daughters; I will give them an eternal name, that shall not be cut off; whosoever keepeth the Sabbath that he profane it 
not, and whoso taketh hold of My covenant, them will I bring in upon the mountain of My holiness, and I will cheer them in My house of prayer (56:2-7); </p>
<p>from all this it is evident that by "those who 
keep the Sabbath holy" are meant those who are in conjunction with the Lord. That they shall be in heaven is signified by "a place and a name better than sons and daughters being given them in the house 
of Jehovah, an eternal name that shall not be cut off," and by their being "brought in upon the mountain of holiness."  [3] In the same: </p>
<p>If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, not doing thy 
wills on the day of My holiness, but shalt call the Sabbath delights, holy to Jehovah, honorable; and shalt honor it, so that thou do not then thy ways, nor find thy desire, or speak a word, then shalt 
thou be delighted upon Jehovah, and I will feed thee with the heritage of Jacob (58:13, 14); </p>
<p>here it is very plain what was represented by "not doing any work on the Sabbath day," namely, that they 
should not do anything from their own, but from the Lord; for the angelic state in heaven is that they will and do nothing from themselves, or from their own, and do not even think and speak therefrom: 
their conjunction with the Lord consists in this. Their own from which they are not to act, is signified by their "not doing their own wills, nor doing their own ways, nor finding their own desire, 
nor speaking a word." This state with the angels is the heavenly state itself; and when they are in it, they have peace and rest, and the Lord also has rest; for when they have been conjoined with 
Him, they labor no more, because they are then in the Lord. These things are signified by the words, thus shalt thou call the Sabbath the holy delights of Jehovah, and they shall be delighted upon Jehovah." 
The Lord's rest is signified by His resting on the seventh day after the six days' creation (Gen. 2:2). [4] Like things are understood by these words in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     If hearing ye shall hear 
Me, that ye bring not in a burden through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day, and that ye hallow the Sabbath day, so that ye do not any work therein, then shall there enter through the gates 
of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariot and on horses, they and their princes, the man of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and this city shall be inhabited 
to eternity (17:24, 25); </p>
<p>by "work on the Sabbath" is signified everything that is from our own; the state of those who are not led by their own, but by the Lord, is described by there "entering 
through the gates of the city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariot and on horses;" by "kings" are signified the truths of faith; by "princes," the primary things thereof; 
by "sitting upon the throne of David," that these are from the Lord; by "the chariot and horses," the doctrinal and intellectual things of faith. Be it known that all things which come from the 
man's own are evil, and that all things which come from the Lord are good. (That with those who are led by the Lord all things flow in, down to the least thing of life both of intellect and of will, 
thus down to each and all things of faith and of charity, see what has been abundantly shown from experience, n. 2886-2888, 6053-6058, 6189-6215, 6307-6327, 6466-6495, 6598-6626, 6982, 6985, 6996, 7004, 
7055, 7056, 7058, 7147, 7270.)  [5] That the Sabbath was representative of the conjunction of the Lord with the human race, is evident in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     I gave them My Sabbaths that they might be 
for a sign between Me and them, to acknowledge that I Jehovah do sanctify them (20:12; also Exod. 31:13). Therefore also it was forbidden to kindle a fire on the Sabbath day (Exod. 35:3), because by 
"fire" was signified everything that is of life; and by "kindling a fire," that which is of life from man's own. From all that has been said it is plain that the Lord is "the Lord of the Sabbath," according 
to His words in Matthew 12:1-8; and it may be seen why many cures were performed by the Lord on the Sabbath days (Matt. 12:10-13; Mark 3:1-8; Luke 6:6-11; 13:10-17; 14:1-6; John 5:9-18; 7:22, 23; 
9:14, 16); for the diseases of which they were healed by the Lord involved spiritual diseases, which are from evil (see n. 7337, 8364). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8495</b></p><p><b>8495.</b>
'A holy sabbath to Jehovah shall tomorrow be' means the joining together of goodness and truth into eternity. This is clear from the meaning of 'sabbath' as the pining together of goodness and truth, 
dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'tomorrow' as into eternity, dealt with in <a href="3998.htm">3998</a>. Anyone who does not know what the sabbath represented, and what it was consequently a sign of, also cannot know 
why it was held to be the holiest institution of all. It was held to be the holiest because in the highest sense it represented the union of the Divine and the Divine Human within the Lord, and in 
the relative sense the pining together of the Lord's Divine Human and the human race. This is why the sabbath was the holiest. And since it represented those realities it also represented heaven in respect 
of the pining together of goodness and truth, that is, the joining together called the heavenly marriage. And since the joining together of goodness and truth is accomplished by the Lord alone 
and nothing at all of it by man, and since it is accomplished in a state of peace, people were most strictly forbidden to do any work on that day. The prohibition was so strict that the soul who did do 
any was to be cut off. This is stated in Moses as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
You shall keep the sabbath, for it is holy to you. He who profanes it must certainly die; for everyone who does work on that day, this soul 
shall be cut off from the midst of his people. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2031:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 31:14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
This was why the one who merely gathered sticks on that day was stoned, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2015:32-36&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 15:32-36</a>. 
</blockquote>
It is also why the command regarding the sabbath 
is the third of the Ten Commandments, coming immediately after the two regarding holy worship of Jehovah, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2020:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 20:8</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%205:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 5:12</a>. And it is why the sabbath is called 'an eternal covenant', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2031:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 31:16</a>; 
for 'a covenant' means a joining together, <a href="665.htm">665</a>, <a href="666.htm">666</a>, <a href="1023.htm">1023</a>, <a href="1038.htm">1038</a>, <a href="1864.htm">1864</a>, <a href="1996.htm">1996</a>, <a href="2003.htm">2003</a>, <a href="2021.htm">2021</a>, <a href="6804.htm">6804</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 From all this one may now see what is meant in the internal sense by the things said about the 
sabbath in the following places, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Blessed is the person keeping the sabbath so that he does not profane it. Thus said Jehovah to the eunuchs who keep My sabbaths and choose that in 
which I delight, and hold fast to My covenant, I will give those in My house and within My walls a place and a name better than sons and daughters; I will give them an eternal name which will not be cut 
off Whoever keeps the sabbath so that he does not profane it, and those who hold fast to My covenant, I will bring them onto My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My house of prayer. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2056:2-7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 56:2-7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From 
these words it is evident that those who are joined to the Lord are meant by those who keep the sabbath holy. That they will be in heaven is meant by the promise that those in Jehovah's house 
will be given a place and a name better than sons and daughters, an eternal name which will not be cut off, and that they will be brought onto the holy mountain. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
If you 
turn away your foot from the sabbath, so that you do not do your own will on My holy day. but call the sabbath, Delights holy to Jehovah, honourable, and honour it, so that you do not do your own ways, 
nor find your own desire or speak [your own] words, then you will take delight in Jehovah, and I will convey you into the high places of the earth, and I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2058:13,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 58:13, 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>What was represented by the requirement that they should not do any work on the sabbath day is clearly evident here, namely that they must not do anything that begins in themselves, 
only what begins in the Lord. For the angelic state in heaven is such that they do not will or do, they do not even think or utter, anything that begins in themselves or what is properly their own. This 
is what their being joined to the Lord consists in. Not doing anything that begins in themselves is meant when it says that they should not do their own will, nor do their own ways, nor find their 
own desire, nor speak [their own] words. This state existing with the angels is the heavenly state itself; and when they are in it they experience peace and rest. Also the Lord has rest, for when they 
have been joined to Him their labour ceases; they now abide in the Lord. These things are meant by the words 'so shall you call the sabbath, Delights holy to Jehovah' and that they will take delight 
in Jehovah. The Lord's rest is meant where it says that after creating on six days 'He rested on the seventh day', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%202:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 2:2</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The same things are meant by the following words in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
If 
you most certainly hear Me, so that you do not bring a burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, and you keep the sabbath day holy, so that you do not do any work in it, then there will 
enter through the gates of this city kings and princes seated on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they and their princes, the men (vir) of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
And this city will be inhabited forever. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2017:24,%2025&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 17:24, 25</a> 
</blockquote>
<p>'Work on the sabbath' means everything that springs from the self. The state of people who are not led by self but by the Lord is what 'there 
will enter through the gates of the city kings and princes seated on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses' describes. 'Kings' means the truths of faith, 'princes' leading aspects 
of them, 'seated on the throne of David' the fact that they come from the Lord, and 'chariots and horses' religious teachings and intellectual concepts belonging to faith. It should be recognized that 
everything coming from a person's self is bad, and everything coming from the Lord is good. The fact that everything, in the case of those who are led by the Lord, flows in, down to the smallest particle 
of life in both their understanding and their will, thus down to every single part of the faith and charity they possess, see what has been shown abundantly from experience in <a href="2886.htm">2886</a>-<a href="2888.htm">2888</a>, <a href="6053.htm">6053</a>-<a href="6058.htm">6058</a>, <a href="6189.htm">6189</a>-<a href="6215.htm">6215</a>, <a href="6307.htm">6307</a>-<a href="6327.htm">6327</a>, <a href="6466.htm">6466</a>-<a href="6495.htm">6495</a>, <a href="6598.htm">6598</a>-<a href="6626.htm">6626</a>, <a href="6982.htm">6982</a>, <a href="6985.htm">6985</a>, <a href="6996.htm">6996</a>, <a href="7004.htm">7004</a>, <a href="7055.htm">7055</a>, <a href="7056.htm">7056</a>, <a href="7058.htm">7058</a>, <a href="7147.htm">7147</a>, <a href="7270.htm">7270</a>. </p>

 As regards the sabbath and its being a representative of the pining together of the Lord and 
the human race, this is clear in Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
I gave them My sabbaths, in order that they might be a sign between Me and them, to know that I am Jehovah who sanctifies them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2020:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 20:12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
See too Exod. 
31:13. Therefore also it was forbidden to kindle fire on the sabbath day, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2035:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 35:3</a>, because 'fire' meant all that composed life, and 'kindling fire' that which composed life beginning from self. 
From all that has been stated it is evident that the Lord is Lord of the sabbath, in accordance with His words in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matthew%2012:1-9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matthew 12:1-9</a>. 
</blockquote>
It is evident too why a large number of healings by the Lord were performed 
on sabbath days, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2012:10-14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 12:10-14</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%203:1-6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 3:1-6</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%206:6-12;%2013:10-17;%2014:1-6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 6:6-12; 13:10-17; 14:1-6</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%205:9-18;%207:22,%2023;%209:14,%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 5:9-18; 7:22, 23; 9:14, 16</a>; for the sicknesses from which the Lord healed people involved spiritual sicknesses which

`Sabbatum sanctum Jehovae cras': quod significet conjunctionem boni et veri in aeternum, constat ex significatione `sabbati' quod sit conjunctio boni et veri, de qua sequitur, et ex significatione `cras' 
quod sit in aeternum, de qua n. 3998.  Qui non scit quid sabbatum repraesentaverat, et inde quid significaverat, nec (t)scire potest cur id {1}omnium sanctissimum habitum fuerat; sed pro sanctissimo 
habitum fuit ob causam quia in supremo sensu repraesentabat unionem Divini ac Divini Humani in Domino, ac in sensu respectivo conjunctionem Divini Humani Domini cum genere humano; inde sabbatum erat 
sanctissimum; et quia illa repraesentabat, etiam repraesentabat caelum quoad conjunctionem boni et veri, quae conjunctio conjugium caeleste vocatur; et quia conjunctio boni et veri fit a solo Domino, 
et {2} nihil ejus ab homine, ac quia illa fit in statu pacis, idcirco severissime interdictum fuit ut homo tunc aliquod opus faceret, usque adeo ut exscinderetur anima (x)quae id faceret, de qua apud 
Moschen, Servabitis sabbatum, quia sanctum illud vobis; qui {3}profanat illud moriendo morietur; quia Omnis qui facit opus in eo exscindetur anima haec e medio populi sui, Exod. (x)xxxi 14: </p>
<p>ideo 
{4} lapidatus est qui solum die illo ligna colligis, Num. xv 32-(x)36: ideo etiam praeceptum de sabbato est tertium praeceptum in decalogo, immediate sequens post bina de sancto cultu Jehovae, Exod. 
xx 8; Deus. v 12: ac ideo vocatur sabbatum `foedus aeternum,' Exod. xxxi 16, per `foedus' enim significatur conjunctio, n. 665, 666, 1023, 1038, 1864, 1996, 2003, 2021, 6804. 	2 Ex his nunc constare 
potest quid in sensu interno intelligitur per illa quae in sequentibus his locis de sabbato dicuntur, ut quae apud Esaiam, Beatus homo custodiens sabbatum ut non profanet illud: sic dixit Jehovah eunuchis 
qui custodiunt sabbata Mea, et eligunt quo delector, ac tenent foedus Meum, Dabo illis in domo Mea, et intra muros Meos locum et nomen, bonum prae filiis et filiabus; nomen aeternitatis dabo illis 
quod non exscindetur: quisquis custodit sabbatum ut non profanet id, et qui tenent foedus Meum, introducam illos super montem sanctitatis Meae, et exhilarabo illos in domo precationis Meae, lvi 2-7; </p>
<p>ex 
his patet quod per illos qui sanctificant sabbatum intelligantur qui in conjunctione cum Domino sunt; quod illi erunt in caelo, significatur per quod `{5}dabitur illis in domo Jehovae locus et nomen, 
bonum prae filiis et filiabus, nomen aeternitatis quod non exscindetur,' et quod `introducentur super montem sanctitatis': apud eundem, 3 Si avertis a sabbato pedem tuum, ut non facias voluntates 
tuas in die sanctitatis Meae, sed vocaveris sabbatum delicias sanctas Jehovae honorabiles, atque honoraveris illud, ut non facias vias tuas {6}, nec invenias desiderium tuum, aut loquaris verbum, tunc 
deliciaberis super Jehovah, et eveham te in excelsa terrae, et cibabo te hereditate Jacobi, lviii, 13, 14; </p>
<p>hic patet evidenter quid {7}repraesentavit quod non die sabbati aliquod opus facerent, nempe 
quod non ex proprio aliquid agent, sed ex Domino; status enim angelicus in caelo est ut nihil ex se seu ex proprio suo velint et agant, ac ne quidem {8}cogitent et loquantur, conjunctio illorum cum 
Domino consistit in eo; proprium ex quo non {9}agunt significatur per quod `non facerent voluntates suas,' {10}nec `facerent vias suas,' nec `invenirent desiderium suum,' nec `loquerentur verbum'; 
ille status apud angelos est ipse status caelestis; cumque in illo sunt, tunc est illis pax et quies; et quoque est quies Domino, nam {11}cum conjuncti sunt cum Ipso, non amplius est labor cum illis, 
sunt enim tunc in Domino; haec significantur per verba, `sic vocabis sabbatum delicias sanctas Jehovae, et deliciabuntur super Jehovah': {12}requies Domini significatur per quod post sex dierum creationem 
requieverit 4 die septimo, Gen. ii 2: {13}similia intelliguntur per haec verba apud Jeremiam, Si audiendo audiveritis Me, ut non introducatis onus per portas urbis hujus in die sabbati, et quod 
sanctificetis diem sabbati ita ut non faciatis in illo ullum opus, tunc intrabunt per portas urbis hujus reges et principes, sedentes super throno Davidis, equitantes in curru et equis, ipsi et principes 
illorum, vir Jehudae, et habitatores Hierosolymae, et habitabitur urbs haec in aeternum, xvii 24, 25; </p>
<p>per `opus in sabbato' significatur omne quod ex proprio; status illorum qui non ex proprio sed 
ex Domino ducuntur describitur per quod `intrabunt per portas urbis reges et principes, sedentes super throno Davidis, equitantes in curru et equis'; per `reges' significantur vera fidei, per `principes' 
primaria illorum, per `{14}sedere super throno Davidis' quod illa a Domino, (d)per `{15} currum et equos' fidei doctrinalia et {16} intellectualia; sciendum quod omnia quae ex proprio hominis veniant 
sint mala, et quae ex Domino bona; quod apud illos qui a Domino {17}ducuntur, omnia {18}influant usque ad minimum vitae tam intellectualis quam voluntariae, ita usque ad omnia et singula fidei et 
charitatis, videantur quae copiose ab experientia ostensa sunt, n. 2886-2888, 6053-6058, 6189-6215, 6307-6327, 6466-6495, 6598-6626, 6982, 6985, 6996, (a)7004, 7055, 7056, 7058, 7147, 7270. 	5 Quod 
sabbatum esset repraesentativum conjunctionis Domini cum genere humano, constat apud Ezechielem, Sabbata Mea dedi illis, ut essent in signum inter Me et inter illos, ad agnoscendum quod Ego Jehovah 
sanctificans illos, xx 12; {19} Exod. xxxi 13. Ideo quoque prohibebatur `ignem accendere die sabbati,' Exod. xxxv 3, quia per `ignem' significabatur omne quod vitae est, et per `accendere ignem' quod 
vitae ex proprio.  Ex illis quae dicta sunt, {20} patet quod Dominus sit Dominus sabbati, secundum Ipsius verba apud (x)Matthaeum xii 1-9, et cur plures sanationes a Domino factae sint {21}diebus sabbati, 
Matth. xii 10-14; Marc. iii 1-(x)6; Luc. vi 6-12, xiii 10-(x)17, xiv 1-(x)6; Joh. v 9-(x)18, vii 22, 23, ix 14, 16; nam morbi a quibus sanabantur a Domino involvebant morbos spirituales, qui sunt
