<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3248节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3248.</strong>“趁着自己还在世的时候”表他能将生命赋予他们。这从“趁着自己还在世”或“趁自己还活着”的含义清楚可知，“趁着自己还在世”或“趁自己还活着”是指赋予生命；因为亚伯拉罕在此代表主的神性人。属灵之人通过主的神性人而拥有生命（参看<a href="2661.htm">2661</a>，<a href="2716.htm">2716</a>，<a href="2833.htm">2833</a>，<a href="2834.htm">2834</a>节）。当他们的生命来自这一源头时，就说主与他们生活在一起，甚至在日常用语中也是这么说。正因如此，就内义而言，“趁着自己还在世的时候”表示赋予生命。生活通过接下来这句经文所表示的信之良善被赋予那些属灵之人。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3248</b></p><p><b>3248.</b>
While he was yet living. That this signifies to whom he could give life, is evident from the signification of "while he was yet living," or "while he yet might live," as being to give life; for by Abraham 
is here represented the Lord as to the Divine Human. That the spiritual have life from the Lord's Divine Human may be seen above (n. 2661, 2716, 2833, 2834). When their life is from this source 
the Lord is said to "live" with them, even in common speech. Hence it is that in the internal sense by "while Abraham was yet living" is signified giving life. Life is given to those who are spiritual 
by means of the good of faith, which is meant by the words which now follow. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3248</b></p><p><b>3248.</b>
'While he was still living' means to whom he was able to impart life. This is clear from the meaning of 'while he was still living', or while he still lived, as imparting life; for 'Abraham' here represents 
the Lord as regards the Divine Human. Regarding the Lord's Divine Human being the source of life for those who are spiritual, see <a href="2661.htm">2661</a>, <a href="2716.htm">2716</a>, <a href="2833.htm">2833</a>, <a href="2834.htm">2834</a>. When that is the source of their life 
the Lord is said to live with them, as also in everyday speech. Consequently 'while Abraham was still living' means in the internal sense imparting life. Life is imparted to those who are spiritual through 
the good of faith, which is what the words that follow next are used to mean. </p>

</p><b>3248.</b>
`Adhuc illo vivente': quod significet quibus vitam dare potuit, constat ex significatione `adhuc illo vivente,' seu cum adhuc ille viveret, quod sit vitam dare; per `Abraham' enim repraesentatur Dominus 
hic quoad Divinum Humanum; quod ex Divino Humano Domini sit spiritualibus vita, videatur n. 2661, 2716, 2833, 2834; cum vita illis inde, dicitur Dominus vivere apud (c)illos, ita quoque in familiari 
sermone; inde est quod `Abrahamo adhuc vivente' significet in sensu interno vitam dare: vita spiritualibus datur per bonum fidei, quod intelligitur per verba quae nunc sequuntur. </p>
