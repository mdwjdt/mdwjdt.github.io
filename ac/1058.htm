<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1058节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1058.</strong>“神对挪亚说”表教会会知道这一切。这一点从所论述的一系列事物清楚可知，这些事物只有通过内义才变得明显，它们在内义上是以这种方式连贯在一起的：首先论述的是内有教会的重生的属灵之人；其次论述的是全世界的每个人；再次论述的是能重生的每个人。本节是结论，即教会会知道这一切。前面说过，“挪亚”是指教会，在此尤指一般意义上的属灵教会，因为只提及挪亚的名字。接下来就是教会会知道的一切。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1058.</strong> God said to Noah means that the church would know the following. This is borne out by the sequence of ideas, which are visible only in the inner meaning, where they connect in this way: The first subject is people inside the church who are regenerate and spiritual. The second is everyone throughout the world. The third is everyone who is capable of regenerating. The present verse rounds out the series by saying that the church would know the following. (It was shown earlier that Noah is a church [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1058/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_529" target=_top>529-531</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1058/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_597" target=_top>597-598</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1058/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_768" target=_top>768</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1058/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_788" target=_top>788:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1058/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_915" target=_top>915</a>]; here he is the spiritual church as a whole, since his name is the only one mentioned.) What the church would know now follows. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1058</b></p><p><b>1058.</b>
And God said unto Noah. That this signifies that the church should know this, is evident from the series of things treated of, which does not appear except from the internal sense, in which these things 
are thus connected: first, the regenerated spiritual man within the church is treated of; second, every man, universally; third, every man who can be regenerated; and this is the conclusion, namely, 
that the church should know this. That "Noah" is the church was shown before, and here indeed he is the spiritual church in general, because Noah alone is named. What the church should know, now follows. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1058</b></p><p><b>1058.</b>
That 'God said to Noah' means that the Church would know this is clear from the train of thought, which is not evident except from the internal sense in which these details are knit together in this 
way. First the subject was the regenerate spiritual person inside the Church; secondly it was everybody throughout the whole world; and thirdly everyone who is able to be regenerated. The present verse 
is the conclusion to these considerations, namely that the Church would know this. That 'Noah' means the Church has been shown already, and here more especially the spiritual Church in general since 
Noah's name alone is mentioned. What the Church would know follows next. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1058</b>
</p><b>1058.</b>
Quod 'dixit Deus ad Noahum' significet quod hoc scire Ecclesia, constat ex serie rerum, quae non patet nisi a sensu interno in quo haec ita cohaerent; primum actum est de homine regenerat spirituali 
intra Ecclesiam; secundo, de omni homine in universo; tertio, de omni homine qui regenerari potest; hic est clausula, quod nempe hoc sciret Ecclesia; quod 'Noahus' sit Ecclesia, prius ostensum est, et 
quidem hic, quod sit Ecclesia spiritualis in genere, quia solus Noahus nominatur; quid sciret nunc sequitur. </p>
