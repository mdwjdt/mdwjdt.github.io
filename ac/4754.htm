<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4754节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4754.</strong>“因为他是我们的兄弟，我们的肉”表因为从他们那里所得来的，都被接受。这从“兄弟”和“肉”的含义清楚可知：“兄弟”是指出于良善的血亲关系（<a href="3815.htm">3815</a>节）；“肉”是指人自己的东西，无论正面意义上的，还是反面意义上的（<a href="3813.htm">3813</a>节），因而表示它被接受，因为它是从那些属于教会的人那里得来的；它之所以被这些人接受，是因为它被那些处于简单良善的人接受。事实上，以实玛利人代表那些处于简单良善的人，约瑟的兄弟代表坚持与仁分离之信的教会。那些处于简单良善的人承认主的人身是神性，也承认为了人能得救，必须实践仁爱的行为。坚持与仁分离之信的信徒知道这一点，因而在每个人面前不怎么强烈坚持与仁分离之信；事实上，他们几乎不在那些处于简单良善的人面前提及它。究其原因，主要是他们不敢说违背常识的话，由此损害他们自己的地位和利益。因为如果他们否认这些真理，那些处于简单良善的人就会说他们愚蠢；因为那些处于简单良善的人知道何为爱，何为爱的行为；但他们不知道何为与这些分离的信。赞成信仰而非行为，并涉及主的人身和神性之间区别的论据，他们会称之为他们所不理解的诡辩。因此，为叫他们能被接受，并且因为从他们那里所得来的，都被接受，坚持唯信的信徒选择妥协的立场；因为如果这些真理被毁，这既对他们没有好处，也不会给予他们任何优越感（<a href="4751.htm">4751</a>节）。</p>

For he is our brother, our flesh. That this signifies because what is from them is accepted, is evident from the signification of a "brother," as being consanguinity from good (n. 3815); and from the 
signification of "flesh," as being one's own in both senses (n. 3813), thus that it was accepted, because from those who are of the church, and that it was accepted by these, because by those who are 
in simple good. For the Ishmaelites represent those who are in simple good, and Joseph's brethren represent the church which is in faith separate from charity. Those who are in simple good acknowledge 
that the Lord's Human is Divine, and also that in order for man to be saved the works of charity ought to be done. Those who are in faith separate know this, and therefore they do not strongly insist 
on this faith before everyone, and scarcely at all before those who are in simple good; chiefly because they dare not speak contrary to common sense, and because they would thus detract from their own 
dignity and gain. For if they should deny these truths, those who are in simple good would say of them that they are foolish; for those who are in simple good know what love is, and what the works 
of love are; but what faith separate from them is they do not know. Arguments in favor of faith as opposed to works, and concerning the distinction between the Human and the Divine of the Lord, they would 
call sophisms which they do not comprehend. Wherefore in order that they may be accepted, and because what is from them is accepted, those who are in faith separate willingly make concessions; for 
if these truths were extinguished they would be without profit and eminence (n. 4751). </p>

'Because he is our brother, our flesh' means because that which is received from them is accepted. This is clear from the meaning of 'brother' as a blood relationship by virtue of good, dealt with in <a href="3815.htm">3815</a>, and from the meaning of 'flesh' as that which is one's own in both the genuine and the contrary senses, dealt with in <a href="3813.htm">3813</a>, and so means that it was accepted because it was received from those 
who belonged to the Church, and that it was accepted by these because it was accepted by those in whom simple good was present. For the Ishmaelites represent those in whom simple good is present, while 
Joseph's brothers represent the Church that adheres to faith separated from charity. Those in whom simple good is present acknowledge that the Lord's Human is Divine and also that the works of charity 
must be done so that a person may be saved. Adherents to faith separated from charity know this, and therefore they do not in everyone's presence insist emphatically on faith separated from charity; 
indeed they hardly mention it among those in whom simple good is present. The main reason for this is that they do not dare to express anything contrary to common sense, thereby robbing themselves of 
position and gain. For if those in whom simple good is present rejected such ideas about faith separated from charity, they would say that these adherents to those ideas were stupid. Those in whom simple 
good is present know what love is and what the works of love are; but what faith separated from these may be they do not know. Arguments favouring faith rather than works and concerning the distinction 
drawn between the Lord's Divine and His Human they would call sophisticated ones beyond their grasp. This being so, to get themselves accepted, and because what is received from them is accepted, 
the adherents to faith alone choose to compromise their position; for if those truths were annihilated it would be no profit to them and would not give them any superiority, <a href="4751.htm">4751</a>. </p>

`Quia frater noster, caro nostra is': quod significet quia acceptum quod ex illis, constat ex significatione `fratris' quod sit consanguineum ex bono, de qua n. 3815; et ex significatione `carnis' 
quod sit proprium in utroque sensu, de qua n. 3813; ita quod acceptum, quia ab illis qui ab Ecclesia, et quod acceptum his, quia ab illis qui in simplici bono; Jishmaelitae enim repraesentant illos 
qui in simplici bono (o)sunt, et `fratres Josephi' repraesentant Ecclesiam quae in fide separata a charitate; qui in simplici bono sunt, agnoscunt quod Humanum Domini Divinum sit, tum quoque quod 
charitatis opera facienda sint ut salvetur homo; hoc sciunt illi qui a fide separata, quapropter non acriter instant coram omnibus, et vix aliquid coram illis qui in simplici bono sunt, ex causa 
praecipue quia contra communem sensum non ausint, et quia sic derogarent sibi dignitatem et lucrum, dicerent enim qui in simplici bono sunt, de illis si talia negarent, quod fatui essent, sciunt enim 
quid amor et quid amoris opera at quid fides ab illis separata, non sciunt; argumentationes pro fide contra opera, et de distinctione inter Humanum et Divinum Domini, vocarent sophismata quae non 
capiunt; quapropter ut accepti sint, (c)et quia acceptum {1} quod ab illis, libenter concedunt, nam si illa {2} vera exstinguerentur, illis nihil proficuum et nihil altitudinis esset, n. 4751.
