<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4373节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4373.</strong>“雅各再三地求他，他才收下了”表源于真理之良善的这情感通过神性良善所激发的情感被注入。这从4364节以来所给出的解释清楚可知。雅各求他进一步证明了由神性良善在良善里面所激发的对真理的情感本身（参看<a href="4366.htm">4366</a>节）。在详细论述这几节所论述的对真理的情感之前，要知道，尽管这情感看似源于真理，因而存在于真理里面，然而它并非源于真理，而是源于良善；因为真理若不凭着出自良善的东西，毫无生命可言。它似乎源于真理的表象好比肉体里面生命。事实上，这生命并不属于肉体，而是属于灵魂，然而也不属于灵魂，而是经由灵魂从生命的最初源头，也就是从主流出，无论它看似如何属于肉体。它还好比镜中的像，这镜像看似在镜子里，实际上是从外面进入的形状的反射。<br />对那些将心思局限于历史细节的人来说，的确很难看出这些话和之前那些话的内义具有这样的性质；因为他们会思想以扫和雅各，思想提前送出的礼物；殊不知，以扫代表属世层里面的神性良善，雅各代表要在那里与神性良善结合的真理。他们也没有意识到，以扫和雅各的友好对话在此表示由良善激发进入真理的情感。然而，当世人读到这些历史细节时，天使绝不会理解为历史；因为天使只有属灵的概念，并没有其它概念。对他们来说，历史意义会转化为这种属灵概念。天使的思维就是以这种方式对应于世人的思维。正是这种永恒的对应关系使得圣言成为神圣和神性；因为字义在上升到天堂的过程中会变得属灵，甚至一路上升到主那里，在此变成神性。这就是灵感。</p>

And he urged him, and he took it. That this signifies that from the good of truth this affection was instilled by means of affection inspired by Divine good, may be seen from all that has been thus far 
unfolded (from n. 4364). The affection itself of truth inspired in the good by the Divine good is attested by his urging him (see above, n. 4366). As further regards the affection of truth which is 
treated of in these verses, be it known that this appears to be from truth, and thus in truth, and yet it is not from truth, but from good; for truth has nothing of life in it except that which is from 
good. Its appearing as if it were from truth, is comparatively circumstanced as is the life that is in the body, and yet is not of the body, but of the soul. Nor is it of the soul, but through the 
soul from the first of life (that is, from the Lord), although it appears as if it were of the body. It is also circumstanced as is an image in a mirror, which appears in the mirror, when yet it is of 
the inflowing form.  [2] To those who keep the mind in the mere historicals, it does not indeed appear that the internal sense of these and the foregoing words is of such a nature, for they think of 
Esau and Jacob, and of the gift that was sent forward; not knowing that by Esau is represented Divine good in the natural, and by Jacob the truth which is to be conjoined with the Divine good there; 
and that by their friendly conference is here signified affection inspired into truth by good. And yet when these things are being read by man the angels understand these historicals in no other way; 
for the angels have no other idea than a spiritual one, and with them the historical sense is turned into this idea. In this way do angelic thoughts correspond with human thoughts. It is such perpetual 
correspondences that make the Word holy and Divine; for thus by ascent the literal sense becomes spiritual, and this even to the Lord, where it is Divine. This is inspiration. </p>

'And he urged him. and he took it' means that that affection originating in the good of truth was instilled by means of affection inspired by Divine Good. This becomes clear from the explanations given 
so far in <a href="4364.htm">4364</a> onwards. Further evidence of the actual affection for truth, inspired within the good by Divine Good, is displayed by his urging him, see above in <a href="4366.htm">4366</a>. Before anything more can be said 
about the affection for truth which is the subject in these verses, it should be recognized that although that affection seems to derive from truth and so to exist within truth it does not derive 
from truth but from good; for truth has no life at all within it apart from that which comes from good. Its seeming to derive from truth is, to use a comparison, like the life which is present within 
the body. That life does not in fact belong to the body but to the soul, nor yet to the soul but flows in by way of the soul from the Prime source of life, that is, from the Lord, however much it seems 
to belong to the body It is also like an image in a mirror, which is seen within the mirror but is in fact a reflection of a shape entering from outside. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 To people who confine their minds to 
the historical details it is not indeed apparent that the internal sense of these words and those before them is anything of the kind; for their thought is of Esau, and of Jacob and the gift he sent ahead 
of him. They are not aware of the fact that 'Esau' represents Divine Good within the natural and 'Jacob' truth which is to be joined there to Divine Good. Nor are they aware that their friendly dialogue 
here means an affection inspired within truth by good. Yet the angels understand these historical details in no other way when these are read by man, for angels possess no other mental picture 
of things than a spiritual one. With them the historical sense is converted into that spiritual picture, and in this way angelic thoughts correspond to those of men. It is never-ending correspondences 
such as these that cause the Word to be holy and Divine, for as it rises up to heaven the literal sense becomes spiritual. It also rises all the way up to the Lord, where it becomes Divine. This is 
Inspiration. </p>

`Et ursit illum, et accepit': quod significet quod a veri bono illa per affectionem inspiratam a Divino Bono insinuaretur constare potest ab illis quae huc usque a n. 4364 explicata sunt; </p>
<p>ipsi affectio 
veri bono inspirata a Divino Bono testata est per quod `urserit illum,' videatur supra n. 4366.  (m)Quod affectionem veri de qua in hi versibus actum est, ulterius attinet, sciendum quod illa 
appareat esse a vero, ac ita in vero, sed non est a vero, sed a bono, nam vero nihil vitae inest nisi quae est a bono; quod appareat sicut foret a vero, {1} se habet comparative sicut vita quae est 
in corpore, quae tamen non est corporis sed animae, nec animae sed per animam a Primo vita hoc est, a Domino, et tamen apparet sicut corporis {2}; et quoque habet sicut imago in speculo, quae apparet 
in speculo, `cum tam' est effigiei influentis.(n)  [2] Quod sensus internus horum verborum praecedentium talis sit, non quidem apparet illis qui in historicis tenent mentem, nam de Esau et Jacobo 
deque munere praemisso cogitant, non scientes quod per `Esau' repraesentetur Divinum Bonum in naturali, et per `Jacobum' verum quod Divino Bono conjungendum (o)est ibi, et hic quod per amicam illorum 
collocutionem significetur affectio inspirata vero a bono: at usque historica illa non aliter intelligunt angeli quando illa leguntur ab homine; angeli enim nullam aliam ideam habent quam spiritualem; 
in hanc apud illos vertitur sensus historicus; correspondent ita cogitationes angelicae cum humanis; </p>
<p>sunt perpetuae correspondentiae tales, quae faciunt quod Verbum sanctum et Divinum sit, 
nam litteralis sensus ita per ascensum fit spiritualis, et hoc usque ad Dominum, ubi Divinus: haec est Inspiratio.      @1 apparet tamen usque sicut foret a vero, sed hoc$      @2 in corpore$
