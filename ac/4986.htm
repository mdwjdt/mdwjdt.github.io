Verses 7-9. And it came to pass after these words that his lord's wife lifted up her eyes to Joseph, and she said, Lie with me. And he refused, and said unto his lord's wife, Behold, my lord knoweth 
not what is with me in the house, and all that he hath he hath given into my hand. He is not greater in this house than I; and he hath not withheld from me anything but thee, because thou art his wife; 
and how shall I do this great evil, and sin to God? "And it came to pass after these words," signifies a third state; "that his lord's wife lifted up her eyes to Joseph," signifies truth natural, not 
spiritual, adjoined to natural good, and its perception; "and she said, Lie with me," signifies that it desired conjunction; "and he refused," signifies aversion; "and said unto his lord's wife," signifies 
perception concerning this truth; "Behold, my lord knoweth not what is with me in the house," signifies that natural good did not desire even appropriation; "and all that he hath he hath given 
into my hand," signifies that all was in its power; "he is not greater in this house than I," signifies that that good was prior in time, not in state; "and he hath not withheld from me anything but 
thee," signifies that to be conjoined with the truth of that good was forbidden; "because thou art his wife," signifies because it was not to be conjoined with another good; "and how shall I do this great 
evil, and sin to God?" signifies that thus there would be disjunction, and no conjunction. </p>

Verses 7-9 And it happened after these events, that his lord's wife lifted up her eyes towards Joseph and said, Lie with me. And he refused and said to his lord's wife, Behold, my lord does not concern 
himself with anything<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> in the house, and all that he has he has given into my hand. He himself is no greater in this house than I am, and he has not held back anything from me except yourself, in that 
you are his wife. How then shall I do this great evil, and sin against God? </p>
<p>'And it happened after these events' means a third state. 'That his lord's wife lifted up her eyes towards Joseph' means 
unspiritual natural truth wedded to natural good, and its perception. 'And said, Lie with me' means that it desired a joining together. 'And he refused' means an aversion. 'And he said to his lord's 
wife' means a perception regarding that truth. 'Behold, my lord does not concern himself with anything in the house' means that natural good did not have even the desire to make anything its own. 'And 
all that he has he has given into my hand' means that everything was subject to its power and control. 'He himself is no greater in this house than I am' means that that good is prior in respect of 
time but not of state. 'And he has not held back anything from me except yourself' means that becoming joined to the truth wedded to that good was forbidden. 'In that you are his wife' means because 
this truth must not be joined to any other good. 'How then shall I do this great evil, and sin against God?' means that, this being so, they exist set apart and not joined together.

Vers. 7-9 Et factum post verba haec, et sustulit uxor domini ejus oculos suos ad Josephum, et dixit, Cuba mecum. Et renuit, et dixit ad uxorem domini sui, Ecce dominus meus non scit cum me quid in 
domo, et omne quod est illi dedit in manum meam. Non ipse magnus in domo hac prae me, et non prohibuit a me quicquam, nisi temet, eo quod tu uxor illius; et quomodo faciam malum magnum hoc, et peccarem 
Deo? `Et factum post verba haec' significat tertium statum: `et sustulit uxor domini ejus oculos suos ad Josephum' significat verum naturale non spirituale adjunctum bono naturali, et ejus perceptionem: 
`et dixit, Cuba mecum' significat quod cuperet conjunctionem {1}: `et renuit significat aversationem: </p>
<p>`et dixit ad uxorem domini sui' significat perceptionem de illo vero: `Ecce dominus 
meus non scit cum me quid in domo' significet quod bonum naturale ne quidem appropriationem cuperet: `et omne quod est illi dedit in manum meum significat quod omne in ejus potestate `non ipse manus 
in domo hac prae me' significat quod bonum illud tempore prius non statu: `et non prohibuit a me quicquam nisi temet' significat quod vero boni illius vetitum conjungi: `eo quod tu uxor illius' 
significat quia non alii bono conjungendum: `et quomodo faciam malum magnum hoc, et peccarem Deo?' significat quod sic disjunctio et nulla conjunctio. @1 A i (lascivam)$  </p>
