<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1447节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1447.</strong>“说，我要把这地赐给你的种”表属天之物被恩赐给那些信祂的人。这从“种”和“地”的含义清楚可知。“种”表对主的信，如前所示（<a href="255.htm">255</a>，<a href="256.htm">256</a>节）；“（陆）地”表属天之物，这也在本章第1节说明了（还有<a href="620.htm">620</a>，<a href="636.htm">636</a>，<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>节）。从字义上看，“亚伯兰”的种是指雅各所出的后代，“地”是指应许赐给他们的迦南地本身，以便他们可以代表主国度和教会的属天、属灵之物，并且代表性教会可以设立在他们当中，因为主要在那里降生。但从内义上看，“种”无非是指对主的信，“地”无非是指属天之物，在本节经文中，属天之物要被赐予那些信祂的人。至于信祂意味着什么，这在前面已多次说明。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1447.</strong> The fact that he said, "To your seed I will give this land," means that those who believed in him would receive heavenly gifts can be seen from the symbolism of seed and from the symbolism of land. Seed symbolizes belief in the Lord, as shown earlier, in 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1447/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_255" target=_top>255</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1447/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_256" target=_top>256</a>. Land symbolizes heavenly attributes, as also shown above, at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1447/bible_king-james-version_genesis_12_1" target=_top>1</a> of this chapter [搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1447/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1413" target=_top>1413</a>] and in 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1447/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_620" target=_top>620</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1447/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_636" target=_top>636</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1447/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_662" target=_top>662</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1447/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1066" target=_top>1066</a> as well.<br />On the literal plane, Abram's seed means his descendants by Jacob's line, while the land means the actual land of Canaan. This land was to be given to them as a possession to enable them to represent heavenly and spiritual facets of the Lord's kingdom and church. It was also given to them to enable a representative church to be established among them, and because the Lord was to be born there. On an inner level, however, seed symbolizes nothing but belief in the Lord, while land symbolizes nothing but heavenly qualities. Here, the meaning is that those who believed in him would receive heavenly gifts.<br />It has been said many times before what believing in the Lord means.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For a definition of faith in the Lord, see, for instance, 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1447/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_30" target=_top>30-36</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1447/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_202" target=_top>202-203</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1447/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_393" target=_top>393</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1447/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_654" target=_top>654</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1447/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_896" target=_top>896</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1447/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1162" target=_top>1162</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1447/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1176" target=_top>1176</a>.

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1447</b></p><p><b>1447.</b>
And said, To thy seed will I give this land. That this signifies that celestial things should be given to those who should have faith in Him, is evident from the signification of "seed," and from the 
signification of "land." That "seed" signifies faith in the Lord, was shown above (n. 255, 256); and that "land" signifies celestial things, was also shown above, at verse 1 of this chapter (and also 
n. 620, 636, 662, 1066). In the sense of the letter, by "the seed of Abram" is meant his posterity from Jacob, and by "land" is meant the land of Canaan itself, which would be given them for a possession, 
so that they might represent the celestial and spiritual things of the Lord's kingdom and church, and that the Representative Church might be instituted among them, and because the Lord was to be 
born there; but in the internal sense nothing else is signified by "seed" than faith in the Lord, and by "land" nothing else than celestial things, and in the present passage that celestial things should 
be given those who should have faith in Him. What is meant by having faith in the Lord has already been shown repeatedly. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1447</b></p><p><b>1447.</b>
That 'He said, To your seed will I give this land' means that celestial things would be granted to those who had faith in Him is clear from the meaning of 'land' and from the meaning of 'land'. That 
'seed' means faith in the Lord has been shown already in <a href="255.htm">255</a>, <a href="256.htm">256</a>, and that 'land' means celestial things has also been shown above at verse 1 of this chapter, and in <a href="620.htm">620</a>, <a href="636.htm">636</a>, <a href="662.htm">662</a>, <a href="1066.htm">1066</a>. In the sense 
of the fetter 'the seed of Abram' is used to mean descendants through Jacob, and 'land' the land of Canaan itself which was to be given to them as a possession, for the reason that they might represent 
the celestial and spiritual things of the Lord's kingdom and Church and that among them a representative Church might be established, and because the Lord was to be born in that land. But in the internal 
sense nothing else is meant by 'seed' then faith in the Lord, and by 'land' nothing else than celestial things, and here in particular that celestial things were to be granted to those who had 
faith in Him. What is meant by having faith in the Lord has been stated many times already. </p>

</p><b>1447.</b>
Quod 'dixit, Semini tuo dabo terram hanc' significet quod illis qui fidem in Ipsum haberent, caelestia donarentur, constat ex significatione 'seminis' et ex significatione 'terrae'; quod 'semen' significet 
fidem in Dominum, ostensum est prius n. 255, 256; et quod 'terra' significet caelestia, etiam ostensum est supra ad vers.  1 hujus capitis, tum n. 620, 636, 662, 1066.  In sensu litterae per 'semen 
Abrami' intelligitur posteritas ejus ex Jacobo et per 'terram' ipsa terra Canaan quae illis daretur in possessionem, ob causam ut repraesentarent caelestia et spiritualia Regni et Ecclesiae Domini, 
utque apud eos Ecclesia repraesentativa institueretur, et quia Dominus ibi nasceretur; sed in sensu interno nihil aliud per 'semen' significatur quam fides in Dominum et per 'terram' nihil aliud quam 
caelestia; et hic, quod caelestia illis donarentur qui fidem in Ipsum haberent:  quid per habere fidem in Dominum intelligitur, prius multoties dictum. </p>
