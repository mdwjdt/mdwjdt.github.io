<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7655节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7655.</strong>“埃及已经败坏了，你还不知道吗”表从所发生的事就能知道凡给那些简单人制造麻烦的人都被丢进地狱，地狱是无处可逃的。这从“你还不知道吗”、“败坏”和“埃及”的含义清楚可知：“你还不知道吗”是指从所发生的事就能知道；“败坏”是指被丢进地狱，地狱是无处可逃的，就灵义而言，“败坏”表示这一点，正如“死去”或“死亡”表示诅咒和地狱（参看<a href="5407.htm">5407</a>，<a href="6119.htm">6119</a>，<a href="7494.htm">7494</a>节）；“埃及”是指侵扰（<a href="7278.htm">7278</a>节），因而也指那些进行侵扰的人。但由于正在说话的就是这些侵扰者，所以此处没有把他们称作“侵扰”的人，而是称作“制造麻烦”的人；因为恶人会为自己的邪恶辩解，对它轻描淡写。此处也没有说他们给“那些属于属灵教会的人”制造麻烦，而是说给“那些简单人”制造麻烦，因为恶人用“简单”这个词来描述凡属于教会，并照其真理和良善生活，也就是过着一种信与仁的生活之人。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7655</b></p><p><b>7655.</b>
Knowest thou not yet that Egypt is perishing? That this signifies that from what has happened it can be known that all who harass those simple ones are cast down into hell, whence there is no escape, 
is evident from the signification of "knowest thou not yet?" as being that from what has happened it can be known; from the signification of "to perish," as being to be cast down into hell, whence there 
is no escape-in the spiritual sense this is signified by "perishing," in like manner as by "dying" or "death," which denotes damnation and hell (see n. 5407, 6119, 7494);-and from the signification 
of "Egypt," as being infestation (n. 7278), thus also those who infest. But as it is these infesters who are speaking, it is not said "who infest," but "who harass;" for the evil excuse their evil and 
make light of it; nor is it said that they harass "those of the spiritual church," but "those who are simple," for the evil call all those "simple" who are of the church and live according to its truths 
and goods, that is, a life of faith and of charity. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7655</b></p><p><b>7655.</b>
'Do you not yet know that Egypt is perishing?' means that the things which have taken place go to show that all who give those simple people trouble are cast into hell, from where there is no escape. 
This is clear from the meaning of 'do you not yet know?' as the fact that the things which have taken place may go to show; from the meaning of 'perishing' as being cast into hell, from where there is 
no escape (this is meant in the spiritual sense by 'perishing', just as 'dying' or 'death' - see <a href="5407.htm">5407</a>, <a href="6119.htm">6119</a>, <a href="7494.htm">7494</a> - means damnation and hell); and from the meaning of 'Egypt' as molestation, dealt with 
in <a href="7278.htm">7278</a>, thus also those engaged in it. But since they are the speakers they are not referred to here as those who molest but as those who give trouble, for the evil excuse and make light of their 
evil. Nor are they spoken of as giving trouble to those who belong to the spiritual Church but to those simple people, for the word 'simple' is used by the evil to describe all who belong to the Church 
and lead a life in keeping with its truths and forms of good, which is a life of faith and charity. </p>

</p><b>7655.</b>
`An nondum scis quod pereat Aegyptus?': quod significet quod ex factis sciri possit quod omnes qui simplices illos lacessunt dejiciantur in infernum, unde nulla evasio, constat ex significatione `an 
nondum scis' quod sit quod ex factis sciri possit; ex significatione `perire' quod sit dejici in infernum, unde nulla evasio; hoc in sensu spirituali per `perire' significatur, pariter ac per `mori' 
seu per `mortem,' quae quod sit damnatio et infernum, videatur n. 5407, 6119, 7494; et ex significatione `Aegypti' quod sit infestatio, de qua n. 7278, ita quoque qui infestant; at quia illi loquuntur, 
non dicitur qui infestant, sed qui lacessunt, nam mali {1}malum suum excusant et leve faciunt; nec dicitur quod lacessant illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, sed quod simplices illos, nam mali illos omnes 
qui ab Ecclesia sunt, et vivunt secundum vera et bona {2}ejus, seu vitam fidei et charitatis, vocant simplices. 	@1 omne suum malum$ 	@2 Ecclesiae$ </p>
