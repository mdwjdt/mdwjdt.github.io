<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6623节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6623.</strong>由于存在于思维观念中的细节如此数不胜数，所以天使单凭从思维发出的一句话就能知道一个灵人或世人是何品质。这一点也通过经历向我证明了。当众多灵人一个接一个地只说出“真理”一词时，我立刻就能听出它里面有没有坚硬、粗糙、柔和、天真无邪、珍爱、纯真、丰满或空洞之物，也能听出它里面有没有虚假、炫耀、封闭或开放之物，以及这些东西在它里面的存在程度。简言之，我能听出观念的真正品质，不过，只是大体上的。那么，能察觉观念的具体细节的天使会是什么情况呢？</p>

As there are things so countless in the ideas of thought, the angels can know merely from a single word which proceeds from the thought what is the quality of the spirit, or of the man. This also has 
been confirmed by experience. When the word "truth" was only mentioned, as was done by several spirits in succession, it was instantly heard whether there was in it what is hard, harsh, soft, childlike, 
dear, innocent, full, empty, also whether there was in it what is false, feigned, closed, or open, and in what degree; in a word, the very quality of the idea was heard, and this only in what is general. 
What then must be the case in the singulars which the angels perceive! </p>

Since details so countless are present within the ideas that go to make up thought, the angels can know solely from a single spoken word produced by thought what a spirit or else man is really like. 
This too has been proved to me by means of an experience. When simply the word truth was uttered, which was done by quite a number of spirits one after another, I heard instantly whether it was hard, 
rough, soft, childlike, dear, innocent, full or empty, stained with falsity, pretentious, closed, or open, and in what degree these things were present within it. In short, I heard the actual character 
of the idea, yet only its general character. So what do angels hear who perceive the specific details of the idea? </p>

Quia tam innumerabilia insunt ideis cogitationis, angeli scire possunt solum ex una voce quae prodit ex cogitatione, qualis spiritus aut qualis homo est; hoc quoque confirmatum est per experientiam; 
cum solum nominabatur verum, quod factum a spiritibus pluribus successive, audiebatur ilico {1}num durum, num asperum, num molle, {2} num infantile, num carum, num innocens, num plenum, num vacuum, num 
inibi falsum, num simulatum, num clausum, num apertum, et illa in quo gradu, verbo ipsum quale ideae, et hoc solum in communi, {3}quid non in singularibus quae angeli percipiunt? @1 i non modo$ @2 
i sed etiam$ @3 haec angeli percipiunt in singularibus$ </p>
