<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">关于对应关系（续）</h4><br />此处关于疾病与灵界的对应关系<br />【节】5711.由于此处论述的是疾病的对应关系，所以要知道，人的所有疾病都与灵界有对应关系。事实上，在整个自然界，凡与灵界没有对应关系之物都无法存在，因为它没有原因使得它能凭这原因存在，进而凭这原因持续存在。自然界中的事物无非是结果；它们的原因在灵界，这些原因的原因，即目的，则在内层天堂。结果无法持续存在，除非原因不断在它里面；因为当原因不复存在时，结果也不复存在。就其本身而言，结果无非是原因；只是原因表面上给自己披上一个结果，以便它能作为一个原因在一个较低的领域起作用。原因和目的之间的关系类似于结果和原因之间的关系；除非一个原因也凭它的原因，即一个目的存在，否则，它就不是一个原因；因为一个没有目的的原因缺乏次序，而哪里没有次序，哪里就无物产生。由此明显可知，就其本身而言，一个结果就是一个原因；就其本身而言，一个原因就是一个目的；良善的目的在天堂，从主发出。因此，一个结果并不是一个结果，除非有一个原因在它里面，并不断在它里面；一个原因并不是一个原因，除非有一个目的在它里面，并不断在它里面；一个目的并不是一个良善的目的，除非从主发出的神性在它里面。由此也明显可知，正如世界上的每一个事物都从神性产生，它也从神性继续产生。</p>

Continuation concerning correspondence, here concerning the correspondence of diseases with the Spiritual World.				 As the correspondence of diseases is to be treated of, be it known that all diseases 
in man have correspondence with the spiritual world; for whatever in universal nature has not correspondence with the spiritual world cannot exist, having no cause from which to exist, consequently 
from which to subsist. The things that are in nature are nothing but effects; their causes are in the spiritual world, and the causes of these causes, which are ends, are in the interior heaven. Nor 
can the effect subsist unless the cause is constantly in it, because the effect ceases when the cause ceases. Regarded in itself the effect is nothing else than the cause, but so clothed outwardly as 
to enable the cause to act as a cause in a lower sphere. Similar to the relation of the effect to the cause is that between the cause and the end; unless a cause also exists from its cause, which is 
an end, it is not a cause; for a cause without an end is a cause in no order, and where there is no order nothing is effected. From this it is now plain that regarded in itself an effect is a cause, and 
that regarded in itself a cause is an end, and that an end of good is in heaven and proceeds from the Lord; consequently that an effect is not an effect unless a cause is in it, and constantly in it; 
and that a cause is not a cause unless an end is in it, and constantly in it; and that an end is not an end of good unless the Divine which proceeds from the Lord is in it. Hence it is also plain that 
as each and all things in the world have come forth from the Divine, they continue to come forth from the Divine. </p>

CORRESPONDENCE - continued IN THIS SECTION THE CORRESPONDENCE OF SICKNESSES WITH THE SPIRITUAL WORLD </p>
<p>Since the subject is to be the correspondence of sicknesses, it should be recognized that all 
human sicknesses too have a correspondence with the spiritual world. For nothing at all comes into being in the natural creation that does not have a correspondence with the spiritual world; it has no 
cause from which it may be brought into being and from which it may be kept in being. Things existing in the natural world are nothing else than effects; their causes exist in the spiritual world, while 
the causes behind those causes, which are the ends, exist more internally in heaven. No effect can remain in being unless its cause is present within it constantly; for the instant a cause ceases 
to exist, so does its effect. Essentially an effect is nothing else than its cause; but a cause so clothes itself outwardly with an effect that it is enabled to act as a cause in a lower sphere than its 
own. And similar to the relationship between an effect and its cause is the relationship between a cause and its end. Unless a cause likewise comes into being from its own cause, which is the end, 
it is not a cause; for without an end a cause is devoid of order, and where there is no order nothing is brought into being. From this it is now evident that the essence of an effect is its cause, while 
the essence of a cause is its end, and that an end which has good in view exists in heaven and comes forth from the Lord. Consequently an effect is not an effect unless there is a cause within it, 
constantly there, and a cause is not a cause unless there is an end within it, constantly so. Nor is an end an end that has good in view unless the Divine which goes forth from the Lord is present within 
it. From this it is also evident that even as every single thing in the world has been brought into being from the Divine, so it is kept in being from the Divine. </p>

Continuatio de Correspondentia, hic de Correspondentia  Morborum cum Mundo spirituali </p>
<p>Quia agendum de correspondentia morborum, sciendum quod morbi quoque omnes apud hominem correspondentiam habeant 
cum mundo spirituali; quicquid enim in universa natura non correspondentiam habet cum mundo spirituali, hoc non {1}existit, habet nullam causam ex qua {2}existat, consequenter ex qua subsistat; quae 
in natura sunt, non sunt nisi quam effectus, in mundo spirituali sunt causae illorum, et in caelo interiore sunt causarum illarum causae, quae sunt fines; effectus {3} nec potest subsistere nisi causa 
sit jugiter in {4}illo, nam cessante causa cessat effectus; est effectus in se spectatus non nisi quam causa, sed ita {5}extrinsecus induta ut inserviat in inferiore sphaera ut causa ibi causam agere 
possit; similiter ac cum effectu respective ad causam, etiam se habet cum causa respective ad finem; causa nisi illa quoque existat a sua causa quae est finis, non est causa, nam causa absque fine, 
est causa in nullo ordine, et ubi nullus ordo, non fit aliquid.  Inde nunc patet quod effectus in se spectatus sit causa, et causa in se spectata sit finis, et quod finis boni sit in caelo et procedat 
a Domino, consequenter quod effectus non sit effectus nisi causa insit et jugiter insit, et quod causa non sit causa nisi finis insit et jugiter insit; et quod finis non sit finis {6}boni nisi Divinum 
quod procedit a Domino ei insit; inde etiam patet quod omnia et singula in mundo, sicut exstiterant a Divino, {7}etiam {8}subsistant a Divino. @1 existet I$ @2 A d existat$ @3 i nisi existat a 
causa non potest existere, imo$ @4 suo effectu, cessante enim$ @5 formata et$ @6 qui finis boni sit$ @7 ita$ @8 existant I$ </p>
