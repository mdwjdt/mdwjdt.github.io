<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第618节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>618.</strong>经上在说“挪亚是个义人和完全人”、“与神同行”，以及本节说他“生了三个儿子”时，用的全是过去式，然而这些表述着眼于未来。当知道，内义的特征是，它与时间无关；初始语言就偏向这种特征。有时，用一个或同一个词表示过去、现在或未来的时间，而不是用不同的词，因为内在事物通过这种方式会显得更加明显。语言由于内义而具备这一特征，它的多面性超乎人的想象；所以它并不局限于时间和差别。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]618.</strong> In order to understand why Noah was just and upright, he walked with God, and (in the present verse) he fathered three sons all take the past tense even though they look to future events, you need to know that the nature of the inner meaning makes tense irrelevant. The original language suits this quality, since sometimes one and the same word in it can be understood in any tense; likewise, the words are not divided up.{*1} This exposes the inner content to clearer view. The language acquires its flexibility from the inner meaning, which is more richly layered than anyone could ever believe, and this is why it does not allow tense or partitioning to place restrictions on it.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The exact meaning of the Latin clause here translated "the words are not divided up," nec distinguit inter voces, is not entirely certain. It may refer to the fact that the Word in its earliest form was not divided up into sentences by punctuation, this being a later innovation; see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_618/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4987" target=_top>4987</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_618/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5578" target=_top>5578</a>, and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_618/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_7191" target=_top>7191</a>. It may also refer to the fact that in early manuscripts no breaks between words were marked, allowing for wide ranges in interpretation that are a common feature of rabbinical exegesis. In regard to tense, Hebrew does not have the kind of tense that modern English does. Instead it has two "aspects," one for continuous or repeated action and the other for single events. In English translation, the former is usually rendered as a present or future and the latter as a past, but that is due more to the requirements of English than to the content of the Hebrew.

That "Noah was righteous and perfect" that he "walked with God" and in this verse that he "begat three sons" is all said in the past tense, and yet these expressions look to the future. It should be 
known that the internal sense is such that it has no relation to times; and this the original language favors, where sometimes one and the same word is applicable to any time whatever, without using different 
words, for by this means interior things appear more evidently. The language derives this from the internal sense, which is more manifold than anyone could believe; and therefore it does not 
suffer itself to be limited by times and distinctions. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 618</b></p><p><b>618.</b>
'Noah was righteous and blameless', 'he walked with God', and now here 'he beget three sons', are statements in which the verbs are all in the past tense, even though they in fact have regard to things 
that were yet to be. It should be recognized that the internal sense is such that it carries no temporal connotations, a feature to which the original language also lends itself. Sometimes one and 
the same word there can apply to past, present, or future time, without using different words. In this way interior things come out more clearly into the open. That language derives this characteristic 
from the internal sense which is more manifold than anyone would ever credit. For this reason it does not allow itself to be limited by temporal connotations and distinctions. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 618</b>
</p><b>618.</b>
Quod 'Noah justus et integer fuit,' quod 'ambulavit cum Deo,' et hic quod 'genuit tres filios,' in praeterito dicatur, et tamen spectant futura; sciendum quod talis sit sensus internus, ut nullam rationem 
temporum habeat; cui quoque favet lingua originalis, ubi quandoque vox una eademque ad quodcumque tempus explicabilis est, sicut nec distinguit inter voces; sic patent interiora evidentius.  Lingua 
illa ex sensu interno hoc trahit, qui multiplicior est quam usquam aliquis credere possit; inde non se finiri per tempora et per distinctiones patitur. </p>
