<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2519节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2519.</strong>“亚比米勒还没有亲近她”表就信之教义而言，还没有以任何方式请教理性真理。这从“亚比米勒”和“亲近她”，也就是亲近作为妹子的撒拉的含义清楚可知：“亚比米勒”是指信之教义（参看<a href="2504.htm">2504</a>，<a href="2509.htm">2509</a>，<a href="2510.htm">2510</a>节）；“亲近她”，也就是亲近作为妹子的撒拉，是指触及或以任意方式请教“妹子”所表示的理性真理（<a href="1495.htm">1495</a>，<a href="2508.htm">2508</a>节）。不能以任意方式请教理性的原因如前所述，也就是说，信的教义完全源于神性，而神性无限超越人类理性。理性从神性那里接受它的良善和它的真理。神性能进入理性，但反过来不行；就象灵魂能进入并形成肉体，而肉体却不能进入灵魂；或光能进入阴影，并将它调成各种颜色，而阴影却不能进入光一样。但由于乍一看，理性似乎应该存在，因为理性才是那接受教义之物，故本章说明，进入脑海的第一个想法就是，是不是同时也要请教理性。不过，主给自己的启示和答复是，若请教理性，那教义就会变得一文值。所以，不能请教理性，这就是此处“亚比米勒还没有亲近她”这句话的含义。</p>

Abimelech had not come near her. That this signifies that in the doctrine of faith rational truth had not been consulted in any manner, is evident from the signification of "Abimelech," as being the 
doctrine of faith (see n. 2504, 2509, 2510); and from the signification of "coming near her," namely to Sarah as a sister, as being to touch, or in any manner to consult rational truth, which is a "sister" 
(n. 1495, 2508). The reason why the rational had not been consulted in any manner, is that which has been stated before, namely, that the doctrinal things of faith are in their entirety from the 
Divine, which is infinitely above the human rational. It is from the Divine that the rational receives its good and its truth. The Divine can enter into the rational, but not the rational into the Divine; 
as the soul can enter into the body, and form it, but not the body into the soul; or as light can enter into shade, and modify it variously into colors; but not shade into light. But as it appears 
at first as if the rational ought to be present, because the rational is the very thing that receives the doctrine, it is here shown that the first subject of thought was, whether it also should not 
be consulted at the same time. But the Lord revealed and answered to Himself that doctrine would thus become null and void; and therefore the rational was not consulted; which is here signified by "Abimelech 
not coming near her." </p>

'Abimelech had not come near her' means that where the doctrine of faith was concerned rational truth was not consulted in any way. This is clear from the meaning of 'Abimelech' as the doctrine of faith, 
dealt with in <a href="2504.htm">2504</a>, <a href="2509.htm">2509</a>, <a href="2510.htm">2510</a>, and from the meaning of 'coming near her', that is to say, near Sarah as a sister, as reaching out to or in any way consulting rational truth, meant by 'a sister', <a href="1495.htm">1495</a>, <a href="2508.htm">2508</a>. The reason why the rational was not consulted in any way is that stated already, that matters of doctrine concerning faith - every one of them - are derived from the Divine, which is infinitely 
above the human rational. It is from the Divine that the rational receives its good and its truth. The Divine is able to enter into the rational, but not vice versa, even as the soul can enter 
into the body and give it form, but not the body into the soul, or as light can enter into shade and transform it variously into colours, but not shade into light. But because at first glance it appears 
as though the rational ought to be present since the rational is the very thing which receives doctrine, the present chapter shows that the first thought that came to mind was whether it too should 
not at the same time be consulted. But the Lord revealed it to Himself and replied to Himself that doctrine would in that case be made valueless. Consequently it was not consulted, and this is the meaning 
of the statement here that 'Abimelech had not come near her'. </p>

</p><b>2519.</b>
Quod `Abimelech non appropinquaverat ad illam' significet quod in doctrina fidei non consultum sit verum rationale ullo modo, constat ex significatione `Abimelechi' quod sit doctrina fidei, de qua n. 
(o)2504, 2509, 2510; et a significatione `appropinquare ad illam,' nempe Saram ut sororem, quod sit attingere seu consulere aliquo modo verum rationale, quod est `soror,' n. 1495, 2508. Quod rationale 
non consultum sit ullo modo, causa est quae prius dicta, quod doctrinalia fidei sint omnia ex Divino, quod infinite supra rationale humanum est; ex Divino accipit rationale suam bonum et suum verum; 
intrare potest Divinum in rationale, non autem vicissim; sicut anima intrare in corpus potest, et hoc formare, non autem corpus in animam; aut sicut lux potest intrare in umbram, et hanc modificare 
varie in colores, non autem umbra in lucem: sed quia apparet primum quasi rationale adesse debeat, quia hoc est ipsum illud quod recipit, hic {1} primum cogitationis fuit, annon etiam simul consuleretur; 
sed Dominus sibi Ipsi revelavit et respondit quod sic doctrina nulla fieret; quare nec consultum fuit, quod hic significatur per quod `Abimelech non appropinquaverat ad illam.' 	@1 i hinc.$ </p>
