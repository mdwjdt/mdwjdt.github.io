<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8920节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8920.</strong>“求你和我们说话，我们必听”表接受以一种调整过的形式出现的真理，他们将服从这种形式的真理。这从“说话”的含义和摩西的代表清楚可知：“说话”是指流注和交流（<a href="2951.htm">2951</a>，<a href="3060.htm">3060</a>，<a href="4131.htm">4131</a>，<a href="5481.htm">5481</a>，<a href="5797.htm">5797</a>，<a href="6228.htm">6228</a>，<a href="7270.htm">7270</a>，<a href="8128.htm">8128</a>节），因而也指接受，因为所流入并交流的东西被接受；要说话的摩西是指在天堂之下与天堂里的神之真理结合的从神来的真理，因而是指主与百姓之间的中间人（<a href="8760.htm">8760</a>，<a href="8787.htm">8787</a>，<a href="8805.htm">8805</a>节）。正因如此，“摩西”在此是指以一种调整过的形式出现的真理。<br />至于以一种调整过的形式出现的真理，要知道，当神之真理如圣言那样经由众天堂降至世人这里时，它在下降的过程中经历调整，以适合所有人，既适合天上的人，也适合地上的人。不过，神之真理在从众天堂所处的形式完全不同于它在世上所处的形式。在众天堂，真理就是诸如存在于圣言内义中的那个样子；而在世上，它是诸如显现在圣言字义中的那个样子。事实上，在众天堂本身，它以不同的形式存在，在至内层或第三层天堂以一种形式存在，在中间或第二层天堂以另一种形式存在，在第一层或最低层天堂则又以一种形式存在。神之真理所取的形式，也就是对它的觉知、思维和言论，在至内层或第三层天堂如此超越在中间或第二层天堂的，以致它在这层天堂是不可理解的；它是如此神圣，无与伦比。因为它包含了无数在第二层天堂无法表达的事物；它纯由爱所固有的情感所经历的状态变化构成。然而，神之真理在中间或第二层天堂所取的形式同样超越它在第一或最低层天堂所取的，更是超越神之真理在世上所取的形式。正因如此，在那些天堂所讲的东西，都是诸如人类心智从来不曾察觉，任何耳朵也从未听闻过的那种东西，正如那些被提入天堂的人通过经历所知道的那样。<br />不知道这一点的人以为天上的人和地上的人以同样的方式思考，以同样的方式说话。他们之所以这样认为，是因为他们不知道一个人的内层比他的外层处于更高的状态，或说属于更高层的存在；也不知道天上的人之思维和言语是属天和属灵的，而地上的人之思维和言语是属世的，这二者之间的差别如此之大，以至于无法用语言来描述。关于这些言语类型，可参看前文1634-1650，1757-1759，1876，2157，2472，2476，3342-3345，4104，4609，5225，5287，6040，6982，7002，7089，7131，7191，7381，8343，8733，8734节）。<br />由此也明显可知，神之真理或圣言若不以一种调整过的形式出现，是无法理解的。因为它若高于人们觉知水平，就不会进入理解力，因而不会进入信。这就是为何神之真理以圣言在文字上所取的形式被赋予人类；因为它若以它在天堂所处的形式出现，就不为任何世人所理解；并且一旦有人看见它并注意到它里面的内容，它就会被扔到一边，因为它不会落入诸如属于属世之光的那类事物中。此外，它将充满绝无可能进入人的任何思维观念的那类奥秘，因为它们与通过外在感官从世界衍生出来的表象和幻觉完全格格不入；更不用说隐藏在这些奥秘里面，且若不通过天上的光和火焰的状态变动和变化就无法表达的多重系列的深层奥秘，而天使的言语和思维就是通过这些状态的变动和变化而得以进行的。</p>

Speak thou with us, and we will hear. That this signifies the reception of truth in an accommodated form which so they would obey, is evident from the signification of "speaking," as being influx and 
communication (n. 2951, 3060, 4131, 5481, 5797, 6228, 7270, 8128), therefore also reception, for that which flows in and is communicated is received; and from the representation of Moses, who was to 
speak, as being truth from the Divine beneath heaven conjoined with truth Divine in heaven, thus mediating between the Lord and the people (n. 8760, 8787, 8805); hence it is that "Moses" here denotes 
truth in an accommodated form. [2] As regards truth in an accommodated form, be it known that when truth Divine descends through the heavens to men, as the Word has descended, it is on the way accommodated 
to all, both to those who are in the heavens, and to those who are on the earth. But truth Divine is in quite a different form in the heavens from what it is in the world. In the heavens it is 
such as is the internal sense of the Word; in the world it is such as is its sense in the letter. Nay, in the heavens themselves it is in diverse forms, in one form in the inmost or third heaven, in another 
form in the middle or second heaven, and in still another in the first or ultimate heaven. The form of truth Divine, that is, the perception, thought, and utterance of it, in the inmost or third 
heaven, so transcends that in the middle or second heaven, that in this heaven it cannot be apprehended, it is so Divine and exalted; for it contains innumerable things that cannot be uttered in the 
second heaven; it consists of mere changes of state in respect to the affections of love. But the form of truth Divine in the middle or second heaven transcends in like manner that in the first or ultimate 
heaven, and still more the form of truth Divine in the world. Hence it is that the things which are uttered in those heavens are such as no human mind has ever perceived, nor any ear heard, as 
those know from experience who have been raised into heaven. [3] They who do not know this believe that in the heavens they think no otherwise and speak no otherwise than on the earth; but this they 
believe because they do not know that the interiors of man are in a more exalted state than his exteriors, and that the thought and speech of those who are in the heavens is celestial and spiritual, but 
of those who are on the earth it is natural, the difference between which is so great that it cannot be described in words (but concerning these kinds of speech, see n. 1634-1650, 1757-1759, 1876, 
2157, 2472, 2476, 3342-3345, 4104, 4609, 5225, 5287, 6040, 6982, 7002, 7089, 7131, 7191, 7381, 8343, 8733, 8734). [4] From all this it is also evident that unless truth Divine or the Word were presented 
in an accommodated form, it could not be apprehended; for if it were in a more exalted form than the state of perception, it would not fall into the understanding, thus not into the faith. Hence it 
is that truth Divine was given to man such as is the Word in the letter; for if it were to appear such as it is in heaven, no man would apprehend it, and on the first view and notice would reject it, 
because it would not fall into such things as are of natural light; and moreover it would be full of arcana such as could in no wise enter into any idea of man, because they are altogether repugnant 
to the appearances and fallacies which are derived from the world through the external senses; to say nothing of the deeper arcana which lie hidden within these arcana in manifold series, and that cannot 
possibly be expressed except by means of variations and changes of state of heavenly light and flame, by which angelic speech and thought are carried on. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8920</b></p><p><b>8920.</b>
'Speak yourself to us, [and we will hear]' means the reception of truth in an adjusted form, which - in that form - they will obey. This is clear from the meaning of 'speaking' as influx and communication, 
dealt with in <a href="2951.htm">2951</a>,<a href="3060.htm">3060</a>, <a href="4131.htm">4131</a>, <a href="5481.htm">5481</a>, <a href="5797.htm">5797</a>, <a href="6225.htm">6225</a>, <a href="7270.htm">7270</a>, <a href="8128.htm">8128</a>, and therefore also as reception since what flows in and is communicated is received; and from the representation of Moses, the one who 
should speak, as the truth from God below heaven joined to God's truth in heaven, thus the intermediary between the Lord and the people, dealt with in <a href="8760.htm">8760</a>, <a href="8787.htm">8787</a>, <a href="8805.htm">8805</a>. So it is that here 'Moses' is 
truth in an adjusted form. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards truth in an adjusted form, it should be recognized that when God's truth comes down by way of the heavens to people in the world, as the Word came down, 
it undergoes adjustment for all on its way down, both for those in heaven and for those on earth. But the form in which God's truth exists in the heavens is completely different from that in which it 
exists in the world. In the heavens that truth is as it exists in the internal sense of the Word, in the world it is as it appears in the literal sense. Indeed in the heavens themselves it exists in diverse 
forms - in one form in the inmost or third heaven, in another in the middle or second heaven, and in yet another in the first or lowest heaven. The form that God's truth takes - that is, the perception, 
thought, and utterance of it - in the inmost or third heaven is so superior to the form it takes in the middle or second heaven that it is not comprehensible there; it is so Divine and matchless. 
It contains countless things which cannot find utterance in the second heaven; it consists of nothing other than the changes of state which the affections inherent in love undergo. Yet the form 
God's truth takes in the middle or second heaven is in like manner superior to the one it takes in the first or lowest heaven, and is even more superior to the form God's truth takes in the world. So 
it is that the things which find utterance in those heavens are of a kind that no human mind has ever perceived or any ear has heard, as those who have been raised to heaven know from experience. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
People who have no knowledge of this suppose that those in the heavens think in the same way and speak in the same way as on earth. But they suppose this because they do not know that the interior 
aspects of a person belong to a higher level of existence than exterior ones do, or that the thought and speech of those in the heavens is celestial and spiritual, whereas on earth it is natural, the 
difference between the two being so great that words cannot describe it. But regarding those types of speech, see <a href="1634.htm">1634</a>-<a href="1650.htm">1650</a>, <a href="1757.htm">1757</a>-<a href="1759.htm">1759</a>, <a href="1876.htm">1876</a>, <a href="2157.htm">2157</a>, <a href="2472.htm">2472</a>, <a href="2476.htm">2476</a>, <a href="3342.htm">3342</a>-<a href="3345.htm">3345</a>, <a href="4104.htm">4104</a>, <a href="4609.htm">4609</a>, <a href="5225.htm">5225</a>, <a href="5287.htm">5287</a>, <a href="6040.htm">6040</a>, <a href="6982.htm">6982</a>, <a href="7002.htm">7002</a>, <a href="7089.htm">7089</a>, <a href="7131.htm">7131</a>, <a href="7191.htm">7191</a>, <a href="7381.htm">7381</a>, <a href="8343.htm">8343</a>, <a href="8733.htm">8733</a>, <a href="8734.htm">8734</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From all this also it is evident that unless God's truth or the Word appeared in an adjusted form it would be unintelligible. For if it were 
above people's level of perception it would not pass into understanding or accordingly into faith. This is why God's truth has been given to mankind in the form taken by the Word in the letter; for 
if it were to appear in the form in which it exists in heaven, it would be unintelligible to anyone in the world. As soon as anyone glanced at it and saw what was in it, it would be cast aside, since 
it would not consist in images such as belong to natural light. Furthermore it would be full of arcana which could not possibly find a place in a person's way of thinking because they would be entirely 
at odds with the appearances and illusions derived from the world through the outward senses - not to mention the copious chain of deeper arcana which lie hidden within those arcana and cannot be expressed 
except by variations and changes in the state of heavenly light and flame, by means of which angelic speech and thought are carried on. </p>

`Loquere tu cum nobis': quod significet receptionem veri in forma accommodata cui sic oboedituros, constat ex significatione `loqui' quod sit influxus et communicatio, de quibus n. 2951, 3060, 4131, 
5481, 5797, 6225, 7270, 8128, inde quoque est receptio, nam quod influit et communicatur, hoc recipitur; (d)et ex repraesentatione `Moschis,' qui {1} loqueretur, quod sit verum a Divino infra caelum 
conjunctum vero Divino in caelo, ita medians inter Dominum et populum, de qua n. 8760, 8787, 8805, inde est quod `Moscheh' hic sit verum in forma accommodata. 	[2] Quod verum in forma accommodata {2} 
attinet, sciendum quod verum Divinum cum descendit per caelos ad homines, sicut descenderat Verbum, in via accommodatum sit omnibus tam qui in caelis sunt quam qui in terris; (d)sed verum Divinum prorsus 
in alia forma est in caelis quam in mundo; in caelis est qualis est sensus internus Verbi, in mundo qualis est sensus ejus in littera; immo in ipsis caelis in diversis formis {3} est, in alia {4} 
in intimo seu tertio caelo, in alia in medio seu secundo, et in alia in primo seu ultimo; forma veri Divini, hoc est, ejus perceptio, cogitatio, et enuntiatio, in intimo seu tertio caelo ita transcendit 
illam in medio seu secundo caelo ut (o)in hoc non capi possit, tam Divina et (x)supereminens est, continet enim innumera quae nec enuntiari possunt in secundo caelo; {5} constat e meris mutationibus 
status quoad affectiones quae amoris; forma autem veri Divini in medio seu secundo caelo transcendit similiter illam in primo seu ultimo caelo, et adhuc magis formam veri Divini in mundo; inde est 
quod quae in caelis illis enuntiantur sint talia quae nusquam aliqua mens humana percepit, nec aliqua auris audivit, ut ab experientia sciunt qui in caelum elevati sunt. 	[3] Qui hoc {6} non sciunt credunt 
quod in caelis non aliter cogitent et non aliter `loquantur' quam in terris, sed hoc credunt quia non sciunt quod interiora hominis in eminentiore statu sint quam exteriora, et quod cogitatio et 
(m)loquela illorum qui in caelis sit caelestis et spiritualis, at in terris naturalis, quarum differentia est {7} tanta ut verbis describi nequeat; (o)sed de loquelis illis videantur {8} n. 1634-1650,
