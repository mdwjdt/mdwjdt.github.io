<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3454节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3454.</strong>“你是蒙耶和华赐福的了”表它出自神性。这从“耶和华赐福”的含义清楚可知，当论及主，或也可说论及圣言的内义（因为主就是圣言）时，“耶和华赐福”是指神圣真理（参看<a href="3140.htm">3140</a>节），因而意味着它出自神性。因此，这意思就是，他们未曾向内义施暴，将来也不会，因为它出自神性。向内义施暴就是否认内义的首要事物，也就是本质上的圣言神圣事物；而这些神圣事物是主的神性人，是对主之爱和对邻之爱。这三者是内义的首要事物，是圣言的神圣事物。它们也是取自圣言的一切教义事物的内在和神圣事物，同样是一切敬拜的内在和神圣事物，因为主的国度本身就在它们里面。第四个是，圣言在每一个细节，甚至一点一划上都是神性，因而主就存在于圣言中。这一点是所有取自圣言的教义事物之人所承认和认可的。不过，凡发自内心否认这一点的人都不承认圣言有什么神圣事物，除了显现在字面上的外。因为这种人无论在历史部分还是在预言部分，都感知不到任何神圣之物，除了些微的外在圣洁外，因为人们都说它神圣。然而，倘若圣言的一点一划都是神性，那么它的内在必是神圣的。</p>

Thou art now the blessed of Jehovah. That this signifies that it was from the Divine, is evident from the signification of "the blessed of Jehovah," when said concerning the Lord-or what is the same, 
concerning the internal sense of the Word, for the Lord is the Word-as being Divine truth (see n. 3140), thus from the Divine; therefore that they had not done violence to, and would not do violence 
to the internal sense, because it was from the Divine. But to do violence to the internal sense is to deny those things which are the principal things of this sense, and which are the essential holy things 
of the Word; and these are, the Divine Human of the Lord, love to Him, and love toward the neighbor. These three are the principal things of the internal sense, and are the holy things of the Word; 
they are also the internal and holy things of all doctrinal things that are from the Word; and are likewise the internal and holy things of all worship; for in them is the Lord's kingdom itself. A 
fourth is, that the Word, as to all things therein both in general and in particular, nay, as to the smallest point, is Divine; thus that the Lord is in the Word. This is also confessed and acknowledged 
by all who have doctrinal things from the Word; and yet at heart those deny it who acknowledge no other holiness in the Word than that which appears in the letter; for such can perceive nothing holy 
in the historicals, nor in the propheticals, except only a slight external something, from its being called holy; when yet it must be interiorly holy if it be Divine as to the smallest point.  </p>

'You are now the blessed of Jehovah' means that it came from the Divine. This is clear from the meaning of 'the blessed of Jehovah', when said of the Lord - or what amounts to the same, of the internal 
sense of the Word, for the Lord is the Word - as Divine Truth, dealt with in <a href="3140.htm">3140</a>, and so as meaning that it came from the Divine. Accordingly, the meaning is that they had not done and would not do 
violence to the internal sense because it came from the Divine. Doing violence to the internal sense is refusing to recognize the first and foremost subjects of that sense, which are what make the Word 
holy, namely the Lord's Divine Human, love to Him, and love towards the neighbour. These three are the first and foremost subjects in the internal sense, which make the Word holy. They are also the 
inner reality and the holiness within all matters of doctrine drawn from the Word and within all forms of worship, for they hold the Lord's kingdom itself within them. A fourth subject is that the Word 
in every single detail, even to the smallest part of a letter, is Divine, and thus that the Lord is present in the Word, as is also confessed and acknowledged by all who possess matters of doctrine 
drawn from the Word. Yet all who in their hearts refuse to recognize this do not acknowledge anything holy in the Word except that which is seen in the letter. They are unable to discern anything holy 
at all in the historical sections, or in the prophetical parts, except some slight external holiness because people call it holy. Yet if it is indeed Divine even to the least part of a letter there 
must be an inner holiness to the Word. </p>

`Tu nunc benedictus Jehovae': quod significet quod a Divino, constat ex significatione `benedicti Jehovae' cum dicitur de Domino, seu quod idem, de Verbi sensu interno, nam Dominus est Verbum, quod sit 
Divinum Verum, de qua n. 3140, ita ex Divino: sic, quod non violaverint nec violarent sensum internum quia ex Divino; sed violare sensum internum, est negare illa quae principalia illius sensus sunt, 
{1}quae ipsa sancta Verbi sunt, quae sunt Divinum Humanum Domini, amor in Ipsum, et amor erga proximum; haec tria sunt principalia sensus interni et sancta Verbi; et sunt interna et sancta omnium doctrinalium 
quae ex Verbo, et interna et sancta omnis cultus, {2}nam in illis ipsum regnum Domini est. Quartum est quod Verbum quoad omnia et singula ejus, immo quoad minimum apicem, sit Divinum, ita 
quod Dominus sit in Verbo; hoc quoque confitentur et agnoscunt omnes qui doctrinalia ex Verbo habent; sed usque corde negant illi qui non aliud sanctum in Verbo agnoscunt quam quod in littera apparet; 
illi nihil sanctum appercipere possunt in historicis nisi solum quoddam leve externum, ex eo quod dicatur sanctum, {3}nec in propheticis; cum tamen interius sanctum erit, si quoad minimum apicem, Divinum. @1
