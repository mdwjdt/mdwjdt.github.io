<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7049节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7049.</strong>“那时，她说，你因割礼就是血的新郎了”表尽管内在充满对真理和良善的各种暴力和敌意，但割礼仍作为代表从各种污秽的爱中洁净的标志而被接受。这从“血的新郎”和“割礼”的含义清楚可知：“血的新郎”是指充满对真理和良善的暴力和敌意，如前所述（<a href="7047.htm">7047</a>节）；“割礼”是代表从各种污秽的爱中洁净的一个标志（参看<a href="2039.htm">2039</a>，<a href="2632.htm">2632</a>，<a href="3412.htm">3412</a>，<a href="3413.htm">3413</a>，<a href="4462.htm">4462</a>，<a href="4486.htm">4486</a>，<a href="4493.htm">4493</a>节）。西坡拉之所以说这话，是因为这个民族被允许代表教会，这一点由耶和华不再杀他来表示（<a href="7048.htm">7048</a>节）。割礼之所以成为代表洁净的一个标志，是因为割阳皮表示除去各种污秽的爱，由此使内在露出来（<a href="7045.htm">7045</a>节）。因此，当内在根本不被注意时，如这个民族的情形，因为它处于没有一个内在的外在，那么割礼或割阳皮就只是一个标志，也就是说，一个表示除去各种污秽的爱，因而表示洁净的标志。正因如此，这种做法可以作为一个具有代表性的标志。</p>

Then she said, A bridegroom of bloods as to circumcisions. That this signifies that although the internal was full of violence and hostility against truth and good, still circumcision was to be received 
as a sign representative of purification from filthy loves, is evident from the signification of a "bridegroom of blood," as being what is full of all violence and hostility against truth and good 
(of which above, n. 7047); and from the signification of "circumcision," as being a sign representative of purification from filthy loves (see n. 2039, 2632, 3412, 3413, 4462, 4486, 4493). This is said 
by Zipporah, because it was now permitted that nation to represent the church, which is signified by "ceasing from killing him" (n. 7048). Circumcision was made a sign representative of purification, 
because by "cutting off the foreskin" was signified the removal of filthy loves, and thereby the laying bare of the internal (n. 7045); and therefore when the internal is not at all attended to, as 
was the case with that nation, which was in externals without an internal, there then remains the signification of circumcision or the cutting off of the foreskin, namely, the removal of filthy loves, 
thus purification, for which reason it could serve as a representative sign. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7049</b></p><p><b>7049.</b>
'Then she said, A bridegroom of blood in regard to circumcisions' means that although the internal was full of violence and hostility towards truth and goodness, circumcision was nevertheless accepted 
as a sign representative of purification from filthy kinds of love. This is clear from the meaning of 'a bridegroom of blood' as full of every kind of violence and hostility towards truth and goodness, 
dealt with above in <a href="7047.htm">7047</a>; and from the meaning of 'circumcision' as a sign representative of purification from filthy kinds of love, dealt with in <a href="2039.htm">2039</a>, <a href="2632.htm">2632</a>, <a href="3412.htm">3412</a>, <a href="3417.htm">3417</a>, <a href="4462.htm">4462</a>, <a href="4486.htm">4486</a>, <a href="4493.htm">4493</a>. Zipporah 
says these words because now that nation was allowed to represent the Church, meant by the statement that He ceased from killing him, <a href="7048.htm">7048</a>. The reason why circumcision became a sign representative of 
purification is that cutting off the foreskin meant the removal of filthy kinds of love, as a result of which the internal is laid bare, <a href="7045.htm">7045</a>. When therefore no attention at all is paid to what is internal, 
as was the situation with that nation whose attention was focused on outward forms without their inner meaning, one is left with circumcision or cutting off the foreskin as a sign, that is to 
say, a sign that means the removal of filthy kinds of love, and so means purification. It was for this reason that that practice could serve as a representative sign. </p>

`Tum dixit, Sponsus sanguinum ad circumcisiones': quod significet quod tametsi internum plenum esset violentia et hostilitate contra verum et bonum, usque reciperetur circumcisio pro signo repraesentativo 
purificationis ab amoribus spurcis, constat ex significatione `sponsi sanguinis' quod sit plenum omni violentia et hostilitate contra verum et bonum, de qua supra n. 7047; et ex significatione 
`circumcisionis' quod sit signum repraesentativam purificationis ab amoribus spurcis, de qua n. 2039, 2632, 3412, 3413, 4462, 4486, 4493.  Dicitur hoc a Zippora, quia nunc {1}genti illi permissam fuit 
repraesentare Ecclesiam, quod significatur per quod `cessaverit ab illo occidendo,' n. 7048.  (m)Quod circumcisio facta sit signum repraesentativum purificationis, est quia per abscissionem praeputii 
{2}significabatur remotio amorum spurcorum, et per id nudatio interni, n. 7045; cum itaque ad internum nihil attenditur, {3}ut apud (t)illam gentem quae fuit in externis absque interno, tunc {4}remanet 
significatio circumcisionis seu abscissionis praeputii, nempe quod sit remotio amorum spurcorum, ita purificatio, quapropter illud pro signo repraesentativo inservire potuit.(n) 	@1 After fuit$ 	@2
