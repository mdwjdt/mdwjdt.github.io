<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6337.</strong>“我要把你们末后之日必遇的事告诉你们”表在它们那时被排列于其中的次序里面的教会状态的性质。这从“告诉必遇的事”和“末后之日”的含义清楚可知：“告诉必遇的事”是指交流和预言；“末后之日”是指它们共存于其中的状态的最后阶段。因为“日”是指状态（参看<a href="23.htm">23</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="488.htm">488</a>，<a href="493.htm">493</a>，<a href="893.htm">893</a>，<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="3462.htm">3462</a>，<a href="3785.htm">3785</a>，<a href="4850.htm">4850</a>节），“末后”是指最后阶段；因此，“末后之日”是指一个状态的最后阶段，也就是说，总体上的真理与良善按其适当次序被排列时共存于其中的状态的最后阶段。所表示的，之所以是教会的状态，是因为构成教会的，是因为构成教会的，是雅各和他的儿子们所代表的真理和良善；雅各因此代表教会（<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>，<a href="4439.htm">4439</a>，<a href="4514.htm">4514</a>，<a href="4520.htm">4520</a>，<a href="4680.htm">4680</a>，<a href="4772.htm">4772</a>，<a href="5536.htm">5536</a>，<a href="5540.htm">5540</a>节），“他的儿子们”也是（<a href="5403.htm">5403</a>，<a href="5419.htm">5419</a>，<a href="5427.htm">5427</a>，<a href="5458.htm">5458</a>，<a href="5512.htm">5512</a>节）。之所以表示该状态的性质，是因为对教会真理和良善的代表取决于雅各的儿子们，或各支派在圣言中被提及的顺序（<a href="3862.htm">3862</a>，<a href="3926.htm">3926</a>，<a href="3939.htm">3939</a>节）。因为先提流便时，该状态是一种性质，先提犹大时，该状态是另一种性质。先提流便时，该状态具有这样的性质，它始于信；先提犹大时，该状态则具有这样的性质，它始于爱；先提其他人时，该状态又具有不同的性质，即它始于某种其它东西，而非信或爱。因为状态的性质也照着这二人之后所提到的其余支派的顺序而变化。<br />以这种方式所产生的变化是数不清的，事实上是无限的；当“十二支派”所表示的总体上的真理和良善呈现出具体变化时，尤其如此，各真理和良善都有无数变化（因为那时，各真理和良善一般都具有一个不同的表象）；当这些具体真理或良善呈现出无数细节变化时，更是如此；依此类推。以这种方式所产生的无限变化可通过自然界的许多事物来说明。由此可见，这十二支派在圣言中以这一种顺序被提及时所具有的含义，不同于它们以另一种顺序被提及时所具有的含义。因此，它们在本章具有不同于别处的含义。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6337</b></p><p><b>6337.</b>
And I will tell you what shall befall you in the end of the days. That this signifies the quality of the state of the church in the order in which they then were, is evident from the signification of 
"telling what shall befall," as being to communicate and to foretell; and from the signification of the "end of the days," as being the last of the state in which they are together. For "days" are states 
(see n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788, 3462, 3785, 4850); and the "end" is the last; thus the "end of the days" is the last of the state, namely, that in which truths and goods in general, when in 
their order, are together. The reason why it is the state of the church which is signified, is that the truths and goods which are represented by Jacob and his sons are what constitute the church; therefore 
by Jacob is represented the church (n. 4286, 4439, 4514, 4520, 4680, 4772, 5536, 5540); and so also by his sons (n. 5403, 5419, 5427, 5458, 5512). That the quality of the state is meant, is because 
the representation of the truths and goods of the church is according to the order in which the sons of Jacob or the tribes are mentioned in the Word (n. 3862, 3926, 3939). One quality is signified 
when Reuben is mentioned first, for when Reuben is mentioned first the quality begins from faith; but when Judah is mentioned first, then the quality begins from love; and it is different still when 
some other one is mentioned first. The quality is also varied according to the order in which the rest of the tribes are mentioned after these. Hence come forth innumerable, nay, infinite, variations, 
and more so when the truths and goods in general which are signified by the twelve tribes also take on specific variations, each truth and good innumerable ones, which causes each of them to receive 
in general another face; and still more so when these specific truths and goods take on innumerable singular variations; and so on. That infinite variations thus arise may be illustrated by many things 
in nature. Hence then it is that the twelve tribes have a different signification when mentioned in one order in the Word, from what they have when mentioned in another; thus they have a different 
signification in this chapter from what they have elsewhere. </p>

'And I will show you what will happen to you at the end of days' means the nature of the Church's state within the order in which they were arranged at that time. This is clear from the meaning of 'showing 
what will happen' as communicating and foretelling; and from the meaning of 'the end of days' as the final phase of the state in which they exist together - 'days' being states, <a href="23.htm">23</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="488.htm">488</a>, <a href="493.htm">493</a>, <a href="893.htm">893</a>, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="3462.htm">3462</a>, <a href="3785.htm">3785</a>, <a href="4850.htm">4850</a>, and 'the end' the final phase, so that 'the end of days' is the final phase of a state, that is to say, of the state in which truths and forms of good in general exist 
together when arranged in their proper order. The reason why it is the Church's state which is meant is that the truths and forms of good represented by 'Jacob and his sons' are what constitute the Church, 
on account of which 'Jacob' represents the Church, <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>, <a href="4439.htm">4439</a>, <a href="4514.htm">4514</a>, <a href="4520.htm">4520</a>, <a href="4680.htm">4680</a>, <a href="4772.htm">4772</a>, <a href="5536.htm">5536</a>, <a href="5540.htm">5540</a>, and so also 'his sons', <a href="5403.htm">5403</a>, <a href="5419.htm">5419</a>, <a href="5427.htm">5427</a>, <a href="5458.htm">5458</a>, <a href="5512.htm">5512</a>. And the reason why the nature of that state 
is meant is that the way the Church's truths and forms of good are represented depends on the order in which Jacob's sons or the tribes are mentioned in the Word, see <a href="3862.htm">3862</a>, <a href="3926.htm">3926</a>, <a href="3939.htm">3939</a>. For its nature 
is different if Reuben's name comes first from what it is if Judah's comes first. When Reuben is first the nature of the state is such that it starts with faith; but when Judah is first it is such 
that it starts with love; and the nature of it is different again when it starts with something other than faith or love. For variation in the nature of the state is also indicated by the order in which 
the rest are named after those two. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The variations that are produced in this way are incalculable, indeed infinite, especially so when the truths and forms of good in general that are meant 
by 'the twelve tribes' also take on specific variations, countless ones for each - for then each truth and form of good in general assumes a different appearance - and even more especially so when those 
specific truths or forms of good take on countless individual variations, and so on. The infinite variations produced in this way may be illustrated by very many things that exist in the natural world. 
From all this one may now see that the twelve tribes have a different meaning when their names occur in the Word in one order from when they do so in another. Thus in this chapter they carry a meaning 
different from that seen elsewhere. </p>

`Et indicabo vobis quid continget {1} in postremitate dierum':  quod significet quale status Ecclesiae in illo ordine in quo tunc, constat ex significatione `indicare quid continget' quod sit communicare 
et praedicere; et ex significatione `postremitatis dierum' quod sit ultimum status, in quo sunt simul; `dies' enim sunt status, n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788, 3462, 3785, 4850, et `postremitas' 
est ultimum, ita `postremitas dierum' est ultimum status, nempe in quo vera et bona in genere, cum in suo ordine, {2}sunt simul; quod sit status Ecclesiae (x)qui significatur, est quia vera et bona 
quae repraesentantur per `Jacobum et filios ejus', sunt quae constituunt Ecclesiam; idcirco {3} per `Jacobum' repraesentatur Ecclesia, n. 4286, 4439, 4514, 4520, 4680, 4772, 5536, 5540; ita quoque per 
`filios ejus', n. 5403, 5419, 5427, 5458, 5512; quod sit quale status, est quia repraesentatio verorum et bonorum Ecclesiae se habet secundum ordinem in quo filii Jacobi {4}aut tribus nominantur in Verbo, 
videatur n. 3862, 3926, 3939; aliud enim quale significatur cum primo loco nominatur Reuben, et aliud quale cum primo loco Jehudah; nam cum Reuben, tunc incipit quale a fide, cum autem Jehudah, 
tunc incipit ab amore, aliter {5}cum ab alio; variatur etiam quale secundum ordinem in quo nominantur reliqui post illos; [2]variationes inde existunt innumerabiles, immo infinitae; et magis cum vera 
et bona in genere, quae per duodecim tribus significantur, etiam variationes in specie, quodlibet {6} innumeras, {7}suscipiunt, inde alia facies {8}unicuique vero et bono in genere; et adhuc magis, cum 
specifica (x)illa suscipiunt variationes {9}singulares innumeras, et sic porro; quod inde existant variationes infinitae, illustrari potest a perpluribus in natura:  inde nunc est quod per duodecim 
tribus aliud significetur cum in uno ordine nominantur in Verbo, quam cum in altero; ita aliud in hoc capite quam alibi. @1 see p. 569, ftnote 1$ @2 sunt before vera$ @3 i etiam$ @4 ac$ @5 si$ @6
