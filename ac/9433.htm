<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9433节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9433.</strong>“从云中间”表从以前所存在的模糊。这从“云”的含义清楚可知，“云”是指圣言的最低层，因此相对来说，它是模糊的，如前所述（<a href="9430.htm">9430</a>节）。“云”之所以具有这种含义，是因为发自主的神性真理绝不可能以它所拥有的实际亮度显现。否则，人必灭亡，因为他的理解力被真理之光完全弄瞎了，他的意愿被良善之火彻底灭绝了；因此，他的一切生命都将被消灭。这解释了为何神性真理被调整以适应各人的理解力，并且仿佛被一层云遮盖，甚至在天使中间也是如此（<a href="6849.htm">6849</a>节）。在灵人中间，这种遮盖物显为一层云，其厚薄取决于各人对这真理的接受方式。<br />这一点由以赛亚书中的这些话来表示：<br />耶和华也必在锡安山的一切居民和她的会众以上，日间创造云，夜间创造火焰的烟和闪亮；因为在全荣耀之上必有遮盖。必有亭子，白日可以得荫避热，也可以作为避难所和藏身之处，躲避洪水和暴雨。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛4.5.htm">4:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛4.6.htm">6</a>）<br />“锡安山的一切居民”表示天堂和教会；“她的会众”表示良善和真理；“日间云，夜间火焰的烟和闪亮，遮盖”表示神之真理的遮掩物，因而表示对它的调整，以适应理解它的能力，遮盖将在其上的“荣耀”表示来自主的神性真理（参看<a href="9429.htm">9429</a>节）；“亭子”表示隐藏内层事物的神之真理的最低层；“白日可以得荫避热，也可以作为避难所，躲避洪水和暴雨”这些话的意思是，为使人安全，不受任何伤害。<br />诗篇也描述了对神性真理的遮掩：<br />耶和华我的神啊，你为至大！你披上荣耀和尊荣，用光如衣裳遮盖自己，在水中立楼阁的栋梁，用云彩为战车，将地立在根基上，使地永不动摇。你用深渊遮盖它，犹如衣裳。你定了界限，使水不能过去。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.1.htm">104:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.9.htm">9</a>）<br />耶和华，也就是主所披的“荣耀和尊荣”是指神性真理（参看<a href="9429.htm">9429</a>节）；祂如衣裳遮盖自己所用的“光”是指诸如存在于天堂和教会中的神性真理；因为在圣言中，“光”表示神性真理，可参看前面引用的内容（<a href="9429.htm">9429</a>节）；祂在水中所立“楼阁的栋梁”是指天堂社群，“水”是指真理（<a href="2702.htm">2702</a>，<a href="3058.htm">3058</a>，<a href="3424.htm">3424</a>，<a href="4976.htm">4976</a>，<a href="5668.htm">5668</a>，<a href="8568.htm">8568</a>，<a href="9323.htm">9323</a>节）；祂造战车所用的“云彩”是指形成教义的真理，“战车”是指教义（<a href="5321.htm">5321</a>，<a href="8215.htm">8215</a>节）；祂“将地立在根基上，使地永不动摇”，其中“地”是指教会；因为在圣言中，“地”表示教会（可参看前面所引用的内容<a href="9325.htm">9325</a>节）。它立于其上的“根基”是指最低层的真理，就是诸如存在于字义上的圣言中的那种；所以经上说“地永不动摇”；遮盖它，犹如衣裳的“深渊”是指属世人的外在真理，或关于真理的记忆知识（<a href="6431.htm">6431</a>，<a href="8278.htm">8278</a>节）；由此明显可知，“定了界限，使水不能过去”中的“界限”表示什么，即表示神之真理的最低层，内层事物就终止于这最低层，矗立并停靠于其上，如同它们的支撑和根基，如前所述。</p>

Out of the midst of the cloud. That this signifies out of the obscurity there was before, is evident from the signification of "the cloud," as being the ultimate of the Word, which is therefore relatively 
obscure (of which above, n. 9430). That this is "the cloud" is because the Divine truth which is from the Lord cannot possibly appear in the very brightness in which it is, for man would thereby 
perish, because his understanding would be totally blinded by the light of truth, and his will would be wholly extinguished by the fire of good; thus all his life would he annihilated. Hence it is that 
Divine truth is accommodated to each person's apprehension, and is as it were veiled with a cloud, even with the angels (n. 6849). Among spirits this veiling appears like a cloud, which is dense or 
thin according to the reception of each one. [2] This is meant by these words in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah createth over every habitation of Mount Zion, and over her assemblies, a cloud by day, and a smoke 
and the shining of a flame of fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a covering. And there shall be a pavilion for a shadow in the daytime from the heat, and for a refuge and for a covert 
against flood and against rain (Isa. 4:5, 6); </p>
<p>"the habitation of Mount Zion" denotes heaven and the church; "her assemblies" denote goods and truths; "a cloud by day, a smoke by night, and a covering" 
denote the veiling of truth Divine, thus its accommodation to apprehension. (That the "glory over which there was to be a covering" denotes the Divine truth which is from the Lord, see n. 9429.) "A 
pavilion" denotes the ultimate of truth Divine which hides the interior things; that it shall be "for a shadow in the daytime from the heat, and for a refuge against flood and rain," is in order that 
man may be safe, and may not suffer any harm. [3] The veiling of Divine truth is also described in David: </p>
<p>     O Jehovah my God, Thou art very great, Thou art clothed with glory and honor, who covereth 
Himself with light as with a garment, who layeth the beams of His chambers in the waters, who maketh the clouds His chariot. He foundeth the earth upon her bases, that it should not be moved for ever 
and ever. Thou hast covered it with the abyss as with a garment. Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over (Ps. 104:1-9). The "glory and honor with which Jehovah," that is, the Lord, "clothes 
Himself," denote Divine truth (see n. 9429); the "light with which He is covered as with a garment" denotes Divine truth such as it is in heaven and in the church; that this truth is meant by "light" 
in the Word, see what was cited above (n. 9429); the "chambers whose beams He layeth in the waters" denote the societies of heaven; and the "waters" denote truths (n. 2702, 3058, 3424, 4976, 5668, 
8568, 9323); the "clouds that He maketh His chariot" denote the truths from which is doctrine, a "chariot," being doctrine (n. 5321, 8215); "the earth," of which it is said that "He foundeth it upon 
her bases that it should not be moved forever," denotes the church (that "the earth" in the Word denotes the church, see what was cited above, n. 9325); the "bases on which it is founded" denote truths 
in ultimates, such as are those of the Word in its literal sense; hence it is said that "it should not be moved forever;" "the abyss with which it is covered as with a garment" denotes external truth 
for the natural man (n. 6431, 8278). From this it is plain what is meant by the "bound set that they may not pass over," namely, that it is the ultimate of truth Divine, in which the interior things 
terminate, and on which as on a support and a foundation they subsist and rest, as was said above. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9433</b></p><p><b>9433.</b>
'From the middle of the cloud' means from the obscurity which existed before. This is clear from the meaning of 'the cloud' as the lowest level of the Word, which is obscure, comparatively so, dealt 
with above in <a href="9430.htm">9430</a>. 'The cloud' has this meaning because Divine Truth emanating from the Lord cannot possibly appear with the actual brightness it possesses. If it did a person would be destroyed; for 
his understanding would be completely blinded by the light of truth, and his will would be completely wiped out by the fire of good, so that everything composing his life would be annihilated. This explains 
why Divine Truth is adjusted to everyone's understanding and is covered as though by a cloud, even among angels, <a href="6849.htm">6849</a>. Among spirits that covering manifests itself as a cloud, the thick or thin 
texture of which is determined by the way each one receives that Truth.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This is meant by the following in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah creates over every habitation of Mount Zion, and over her assemblies, 
a cloud by day, and smoke and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory there will be a covering. And there will be a hut for shade by day from the heat, and for a refuge and 
hiding-place from deluge and rain. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%204:5,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 4:5, 6</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Habitation of Mount Zion' means heaven and the Church. 'Her assemblies' means forms of good and truths. 'A cloud by day', 'smoke by night', and 'a 
covering' mean the veiling of God's truth, thus the adjustment of it to the ability to understand it, 'the glory' over which the covering will lie meaning Divine Truth which comes from the Lord, see 
above in <a href="9429.htm">9429</a>. 'A hut' means the lowest level of God's truth which conceals more internal levels, the words 'will be for shade by day from the heat, and for a refuge from deluge and rain' meaning in 
order that a person may be safe from harm.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Another description of the veiling of Divine Truth occurs in David,  </p>
<blockquote>
O Jehovah my God, You are very great! You have put on glory and honour - He who 
covers Himself with light, as if with a garment, who lays the beams for His upper chambers on the waters, who makes the clouds His chariot, who sets the earth on its bases in order that it may never 
be moved.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> You have covered it with the deep as if with a garment. You have set a boundary in order that they may not pass over. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20104:1-6,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 104:1-6, 9</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Glory and honour' which Jehovah, that is, the Lord, 
has put on is Divine Truth, <a href="9429.htm">9429</a>. 'Light' with which He covers Himself, as if with a garment, is Divine Truth as it exists in heaven and in the Church; for in the Word Divine Truth is meant by 'light', 
see the places quoted above in <a href="9429.htm">9429</a>. 'Upper chambers' for which He lays beams on the waters are heavenly communities; and 'the waters' are truths, <a href="2702.htm">2702</a>, <a href="3058.htm">3058</a>, <a href="3424.htm">3424</a>, <a href="4976.htm">4976</a>, <a href="5668.htm">5668</a>, <a href="8568.htm">8568</a>, <a href="9323.htm">9323</a>. 'The 
clouds' which He makes His chariot are the truths from which doctrinal teachings are formed, 'chariot' meaning doctrinal teachings, see <a href="5321.htm">5321</a>, <a href="8215.htm">8215</a>. 'The earth' which, it says, is set on its bases in order 
that it may never be moved is the Church; for 'the earth' in the Word means the Church, see the places quoted in <a href="9325.htm">9325</a>. 'The bases' on which it is set are truths on lowest levels, such as exist in 
the Word, in its literal sense; therefore it says 'in order that it may never be moved'. 'The deep' with which it is covered as if with a garment is factual knowledge of truth for the natural man, <a href="6431.htm">6431</a>, <a href="8278.htm">8278</a>; and from this it is evident what 'the boundary' set in order that they may not pass over is, namely the lowest level of God's truth in which interior things end and on which as their support 
and foundation they stand and rest, as has been stated.

`E medio nubis': quod significet ex obscuro quod prius constat ex significatione `nubis' quod sit ultimum Verbi, quod obscurum ita respective, de qua supra n. 9430; quod `nubes' id sit, est qui; Divinum 
Verum quod a Domino, nusquam apparere potest in ipso jubare in quo est, sic enim periret homo, nam ex luce veri plane occaecaretur ejus intellectuale, et ab igne boni plane exstingueretur ejus voluntarium,

nubes, densitate et tenuitate secundum cujusvis receptionem. 2 Hoc intelligitur per haec apud Esaiam, Creat Jehovah super omne habitaculum montis Zionis, et super convocationes ejus nubem interdiu, 
ac fumum et splendorem ignis flammae noctu; nam super omni gloria obtegumentum; et tugurium erit in umbram interdiu ab ardore, ac in refugium et in latibulum contra inundationem et contra pluviam, 
iv 5, 6; </p>
<p>`habitaculum montis Zionis' est caelum et Ecclesia, `convocationes ejus sunt bona et vera, `nubes interdiu, fumus noctu, ac obtegumentum {1}est obvelatio veri Divini, ita accommodatio secundum

honorem induisti Qui operit Se luce quasi veste, contignat aquis triclinia Sua, ponit; nubes currum Suum, fundat terram super basibus ejus ut non dimoveatur in aeternum et perpetuum; abysso sicut veste
