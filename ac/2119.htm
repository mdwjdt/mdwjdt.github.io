<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2119节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2119.</strong>每个人临终之时生命的最终状态就是他的最后审判。这对有些人来说并非秘密，却很少有人相信它。然而，每个人死后都会复活进入来世，并面临审判，这是永恒的事实。该审判的情况如下：几天后，人的肉体一旦冷却，他就会被主通过一开始与他同在的属天天使恢复知觉。不过，他若无法与属天天使待在一起，就会被属灵天使接管，后来逐渐被善灵接管。因为凡进入来世的，无一例外都会作为客人受到欢迎和接待。但是，由于每个人的欲望都跟随着他，所以，曾过着邪恶生活的人无法长时间地与天使或善灵待在一起，而是逐渐与他们分离，直到最后，他来到其生活与他在世时的生活相类似的灵人当中。这时，他觉得自己仿佛回到肉身的生活，而事实上，这本身就是肉身生活的延续。他的审判就始于这种生活。停留一些时日后，那些过着邪恶生活的人就会下入地狱，而那些过着良善生活的人则逐渐被主提入天堂。这就是每个人的最后审判，这在第一卷的记事中有所说明。</p>

That the last state of each person's life when he dies, is his Last Judgment, is not hidden from some, but still few believe it; when yet it is a constant truth that every man after death rises again 
into the other life, and is brought to judgment. But this Judgment takes place as follows. As soon as man's corporeals grow cold, which takes place after a few days, he is resuscitated by the Lord, by 
means of the celestial angels, who at first are with him. But if the man is such that he cannot remain with those angels, he is received by the spiritual angels; and afterwards in succession by good 
spirits, for all who come into the other life are without exception welcome and accepted guests. But as everyone's desires follow with him, he who had led an evil life cannot stay long with the angels 
and good spirits, but separates himself from them in succession, until at last he comes to spirits of a life similar in nature to that which he had had in the world. It then appears to him as if he 
were in the life of his body, and in fact it is in itself a continuation of that life. With this life his judgment begins. After periods of delay they who have lived an evil life go down into hell; while 
they who have lived a good life are by degrees uplifted by the Lord into heaven. Such is the last judgment of each person, as has been shown from experience in Part First. </p>

The fact that the final phase of each person's life when he dies is his last judgement is no secret to some people; yet few believe it. It is for ever true however that after death everyone rises again 
into the next life and appears for judgement. But that judgement takes place as follows: As soon as a person's physical body grows cold, which occurs after several days, the Lord raises him up by means 
of the celestial angels who are present with him at first. If however he is such that he cannot remain with them, spiritual angels take over, and gradually after that good spirits. For no matter 
how many people enter the next life, they are all received and welcomed as guests. But because the desires of someone who has been leading an evil life follow after him he is unable to stay long with 
angels or good spirits, but he gradually separates himself from them until at length he comes to spirits whose life is similar to and in keeping with his own in the world. At that point it seems to him 
as though he were back in the life of the body; indeed it is in itself a continuation of that life. With this life his judgement begins. Those who have led an evil life go down after some delay into 
hell, while those who have led a good life are gradually raised up by the Lord into heaven. Such is the last judgement of each person, as has been told from experience in Volume One. </p>

</p><b>2119.</b>
Quod `Ultimum vitae cujusvis hominis' cum moritur, sit ei ultimum judicium, aliquos non latet, sed usque pauci credunt; cum tamen constans veritas est quod unusquisque homo post mortem in alteram vitam 
resurgat, et sistatur coram judicio: sed hoc judicium ita se habet: ut primum frigescunt corporea ejus, quod fit post aliquot dies, resuscitatur ille a Domino per angelos caelestes qui primum apud 
illum sunt; sed cum talis est ut cum illis esse nequeat, excipitur ab angelis spiritualibus, et successive postea a bonis spiritibus; nam omnes quotcumque in alteram vitam veniunt, sunt advenae grati 
et accepti; sed quia sequuntur illum desideria ejus qui malam vitam egerat, non diu morari potest apud angelos et bonos spiritus, sed successive semet ab illis separat, et hoc eousque dum venit ad spiritus 
similis et conformis vitae quam habuit in mundo; tunc apparet ei tanquam in vita corporis sui esset, in se etiam est continuatio vitae; ab hac vita incohat ejus judicium: qui malam vitam egerunt, 
per temporis moras descendunt in infernum; qui bonam, per gradus elevantur a Domino in caelum: tale est ultimum judicium cujusvis, de quo ab experientia in Parte Prima. </p>
