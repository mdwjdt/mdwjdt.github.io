<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8137节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8137.</strong>“我便得荣耀”表他们即将看见主的神性人身在驱散虚假中所完成的一个神性壮举。这从“得荣耀”的含义清楚可知，当论及耶和华或主时，“得荣耀”是指一个神性壮举，在此是指由祂的神性人身所完成的一个神性壮举。因为通过祂降世，取得人身并使之变成神性，主将一切邪恶和虚假扔进地狱，使天堂恢复秩序，还将那些属于属灵教会的人从诅咒中释放（参看<a href="6854.htm">6854</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>，<a href="7091.htm">7091</a>，<a href="7828.htm">7828</a>，<a href="7932.htm">7932</a>，<a href="8018.htm">8018</a>节）。“得荣耀”一般表示这些事；但此处的含义是，那些侵扰正直人的人即将被投入地狱，他们将在那里被虚假如同被海水那样包围。这一切将作为仅仅由主的同在所完成的一个神性壮举而发生。<br />为叫人知道这一切的性质，我们将进一步解释这个问题。地狱的数量和邪恶的属并种的数量一样庞大，每个地狱都仿佛被雨雾、乌云、诸水和其它地狱隔开。在来世，邪恶和虚假在灵人眼前显为雨雾、乌云，以及诸水。那些属于属灵教会，并过着邪恶生活的人所陷入的由邪恶所生的虚假显为诸水；但那些属于属天教会的人所陷入的由邪恶所生的虚假显为雨雾。地狱居民就看似被这些诸水和雨雾吞没，只是它们在各处的量和质、厚薄，以及幽暗和浑浊因邪恶所生虚假的属和种而各异。那些陷入与仁分离之信，过着邪恶生活的人所住的地狱仿佛被海水吞没；邪恶所生的虚假在其居民看来的确不像水，只在那些从外面观看的人看来像水。在吞没这些人的那海之上，是奸淫者的地狱。它们之所以在上面，是因为奸淫在内义上是指对良善的玷污和随之对真理的歪曲，因而是指源于反对信之真理和良善的虚假的邪恶（<a href="2466.htm">2466</a>，<a href="2729.htm">2729</a>，<a href="3399.htm">3399</a>节）。这类虚假就存在于那些住在下面的地狱里，过着违背教会真理的生活，并视教会的良善为无足轻重的人。他们因视良善为无足轻重，故也玷污并歪曲圣言关于良善，也就是关于对邻之仁和对神之爱所阐述的一切。<br />至于“在法老和他全军身上得荣耀”，这句话在此意味着他们被淹没在地狱里，被像海水那样的水吞没，仅仅因为见主的面，如前所述。恶人逃离主的面，也就是逃离源于祂的良善和真理的面；事实上，它们一靠近，恶人就感到恐惧、折磨，还由于这良善和真理的同在，他们被自己的邪恶和虚假吞没，因为此时，这些东西从他们身上爆发出来。这些邪恶和虚假确实包围恶人并介入，以防止神性流入使他们备受折磨。这种神性壮举就是此处“在法老和他全军身上得荣耀”所表示的。该壮举之所以由主的神性人身完成，是因为如前所述，主通过其降世，取得人身，并使之变成神性，将一切虚假和邪恶扔进地狱，使天上的真理和良善恢复秩序，将那些属于属灵教会的人从诅咒中释放。</p>

And I will be glorified. That this signifies that they should see a Divine effect from the Divine Human of the Lord in the dissipation of falsity, is evident from the signification of "to be glorified," 
when said of Jehovah or the Lord, as being a Divine effect, here from His Divine Human, because by coming into the world and assuming the Human and making it Divine, the Lord cast into the hells all 
evils and falsities, and reduced the heavens into order, and also liberated from damnation those who were of the spiritual church (see n. 6854, 6914, 7091, 7828, 7932, 8018). These things are in general 
signified by "being glorified," but here there is signified that they who had infested the well-disposed should be cast into hell, and there encompassed about with falsities as with waters of a 
sea, and this as a Divine effect from the mere presence of the Lord.  [2] To show how the case herein is, it shall be further unfolded. There are as many hells as there are genera and species of evils, 
each hell being separated from others as it were by rain-storms, clouds, or waters. In the other life evils and falsities appear before the eyes of spirits as rain-storms and clouds, and also as waters; 
the falsities from evils of those who have been of the spiritual church and have lived evilly, appear as waters; but the falsities from evils of those who have been of the celestial church, appear 
as rain-storms. They who are in the hells appear to be thus encompassed, with a difference everywhere in respect to amount and kind, density and rarity, thick darkness and dimness, according to the 
genus and species of the falsity from evil. The hell where they are who have lived in faith separate from charity and in a life of evil, is encompassed as by the waters of a sea; the falsities of evil 
do not indeed appear as waters to those who are there, but to those who look from without. Above that sea, where these are, are the hells of adulterers; these are above, because in the internal sense 
adulteries denote adulterations of good and the consequent perversions of truth, thus they denote evils from which come falsities contrary to the truths and goods of faith (n. 2466, 2729, 3399), being 
such falsities as are with those who are in the hell beneath, and who have lived contrary to the truth of the church, and have made its good of no account, and therefore have also adulterated and perverted 
everything that is said in the Word about good, that is, about charity toward the neighbor and about love to God.  [3] As regards the "glorification in Pharaoh and in his army," this here denotes 
immersion in this hell and being encompassed by waters as of a sea at the mere presence of the Lord, as was said above. For the evil flee from the presence of the Lord, that is, the presence of 
the good and truth that are from Him, feeling horror and torment at their mere approach; and also by reason of this presence they become encompassed about with their own evils and falsities, for these 
then burst forth from them; and indeed these evils and falsities encompass and are interposed in order to prevent the Divine from flowing in and tormenting them. This is the Divine effect which is here 
signified by the "glorification in Pharaoh and in his army." That this effect is from the Divine Human of the Lord, is because, as before said, by the Lord's coming into the world and assuming the 
Human and making it Divine, He cast all falsities and evils into hell, and reduced truths and goods in the heavens into order, and liberated from damnation those who were of the spiritual church. </p>

'And I will be glorified' means that they were about to see a Divine feat, accomplished by the Lord's Divine Human, in the dispersion of falsity. This is clear from the meaning of 'being glorified', 
when it refers to Jehovah or the Lord, as a Divine feat, here a Divine feat accomplished by His Divine Human. For through His coming into the world, assuming the Human, and making it Divine the Lord cast 
into the hells all evils and falsities, restored the heavens to order, and also delivered from damnation those belonging to the spiritual Church, see <a href="6854.htm">6854</a>, <a href="6914.htm">6914</a>, <a href="7091.htm">7091</a>, <a href="7828.htm">7828</a>, <a href="7932.htm">7932</a>, <a href="8018.htm">8018</a>. These things 
are meant generally by 'being glorified'; but at this point the meaning is that those who molested the upright were to be cast into hell, where they would be engulfed by falsities as if by the waters 
of the sea. And this would take place as a Divine feat, accomplished simply by the Lord's presence. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 So that the nature of all this may become known, the matter will be explained further. The 
number of the hells is as great as that of the genera and species of evils. Every hell is separated from the next as if by mists, clouds, or waters. In the next life evils and falsities appear before 
the eyes of spirits as mists and clouds, and also as waters. The falsities arising from evils of those who belonged to the spiritual Church and led an evil life appear as waters, while the falsities 
arising from evils of those who belonged to the celestial Church appear as mists. The inhabitants of the hells appear engulfed by such waters or mists, though everywhere the amount and nature of them, 
the thickness and thinness, the murkiness and dimness varies as determined by each genus and species of falsity arising from evil. The hell inhabited by those who were governed by faith separated from 
charity and led a life of evil is engulfed as if by waters of the sea. The falsities arising from evil, it is true, do not appear as waters to its inhabitants, only to those looking on from outside. 
Above that sea they are engulfed in are the adulterers' hells. The reason why they are above it is that in the internal sense adulteries are adulterations of good and consequent perversions of truth, 
thus evils from which stem falsities opposed to the truths and forms of the good of faith, <a href="2466.htm">2466</a>, <a href="2729.htm">2729</a>, <a href="3399.htm">3399</a> This kind of falsities exists with those in the hell below, who led a life contrary to the 
Church's truth and considered its good to be of no importance whatever. And because they considered it to be of no importance they also adulterated and perverted everything the Word states about good, 
that is, about charity towards the neighbour and love to God. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 As regards 'being glorified in Pharaoh and in his army', this implies here their submersion into that hell and their engulfment by 
waters like those of the sea, simply at the presence of the Lord, as has been stated above The evil flee from the Lord's presence, that is, from the presence of the goodness and truth that spring from 
Him; for at their mere approach the evil feel terrified and tormented, and also as a result of the presence of that goodness and truth they are engulfed by their own evils and falsities, because these 
now burst out from them. They envelop the evil and are interposed to prevent the Divine from flowing into them, as a consequence of which they would suffer torment. This Divine feat is the meaning 
here of 'being glorified in Pharaoh and in his army'. The reason why the feat is accomplished by the Lord's Divine Human is, as stated above, that through His Coming into the world, assuming the Human 
and making it Divine the Lord cast all falsities and evils into hell, restored to order truths and forms of good in the heavens, and delivered from damnation those belonging to the spiritual Church. </p>

`Et glorificabor': quod significet quod visuri effectum Divinum ex Divino Humano Domini in dissipatione falsi, constat ex significatione `glorificari,' cum de Jehovah seu Domino, quod sit effectus Divinus, 
hic ex Divino Humano Ipsius, quia Dominus per quod venit in mundum, et assumpsit Humanum, et Hoc Divinum fecit, in inferna conjecit omnia {1}mala et falsa, ac caelos redegit in ordinem, et quoque 
liberavit illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali e damnatione, videatur n. 6854, 6914, 7091, 7828, 7932, 8018; haec in genere significantur {2} per `glorificari,' {3}hic autem significatur quod illi qui 
infestaverunt probos conjicerentur in infernum, ac ibi circumfunderentur falsis sicut ab aquis maris, et hoc ut effectus Divinus ex sola praesentia Domini. 	2 Ut sciatur quomodo cum hoc se habet, {4}ulterius 
explicabitur: sunt inferna tot numero quot sunt genera (c)et species malorum; quodlibet infernum est separatum ab altero, {5} sicut per nimbos, nubes, seu aquas; mala et falsa in altera vita 
apparent coram oculis spirituum sicut nimbi et nubes, et quoque sicut aquae; falsa ex malis illorum qui ab Ecclesia spirituali fuerunt et vixerunt male, sicut aquae, {6}falsa autem ex malis illorum qui 
ab Ecclesia caelesti, sicut nimbi; talibus circumfusi apparent illi qui in infernis, ubivis cum differentia {7}quoad quantum et quale, densum et tenue, caliginosum et obscurum, hoc secundum genus et 
speciem falsi ex malo; infernum ubi illi qui in fide separata a charitate (c)et in vita mali vixerunt, est circumfusum sicut ab aquis maris; falsa mali quidem illis qui ibi sunt non apparent sicut aquae, 
sed illis qui extra aspiciunt; supra illud mare, ubi illi, sunt inferna adulterorum; causa quod ibi supra sint, est quia adulteria in sensu interno sunt (x)adulterationes {8}boni et inde (x)perversiones 
veri, ita mala ex quibus falsa contra vera et bona fidei, n. 2466, 2729, 3399; {9}qualia falsa apud illos sunt qui in inferno infra, et vixerunt contra verum Ecclesiae, ac bonum ejus prorsus 
nihili fecerunt, et quia hoc nihili fecerunt, etiam adulteraverunt et perverterunt omne id in Verbo, {10}quod ibi de bono, hoc est, de charitate erga proximum et de amore in Deum, {11}dicitur. 	3 Quod 
glorificationem in Pharaone et in exercitu illius attinet, est illa hic immersio in infernum illud, et circumfusio ab aquis sicut maris, {12}ex sola praesentia Domini, ut supra dictum; mali enim praesentiam 
Domini, hoc est, praesentiam boni et veri quae ab Illo, fugiunt, nam ad solum affluxum illorum horrent, et cruciantur, et quoque ex praesentia illa circumfunduntur suis malis et falsis, nam tunc
