They therefore who either pervert or extinguish or reject in themselves the good of love and the truth of faith, have no life in them; for the life which is from the Divine is to will good and believe 
truth. But they who do not will good but evil, nor believe truth but falsity, have what is contrary to life. This contrary to life is hell, and is called "death," and they are called "dead." That the 
life of love and faith is called "life," also "eternal life," and that they who have it in themselves are called "living men;" and that the contrary of life is called "death," also "eternal death," 
and such men "dead," is evident from many passages in the Word (as in Matt. 4:16; 8:21, 22; 18:8, 9; 19:16, 17, 29; John 3:15, 16, 36; 5:24, 25; 6:33, 35, 47, 48, 50, 51, 53, 57, 58, 63; 8:21, 24, 51; 
10:10; 11:25, 26; 14:6, 19; 17:2, 3; 20:31; and elsewhere).            EXODUS 9 </p>
<p>     1. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Come unto Pharaoh, and speak unto him, Thus said Jehovah the God of the Hebrews, 
Let My people go, that they may serve Me.      2. For if thou refuse to let them go, and if thou still withhold them,      3. Behold, the hand of Jehovah shall be on thy cattle which is in the field, 
on the horses, on the asses, on the camels, on the herd, and on the flock; a very grievous pestilence.      4. And Jehovah shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of the Egyptians, 
and there shall nothing die of all that belongeth to the sons of Israel.      5. And Jehovah appointed a set time, saying, Tomorrow Jehovah shall do this word in the land.      6. And Jehovah did 
this word on the morrow, and all the cattle of the Egyptians died; and of the cattle of the sons of Israel died not one.      7. And Pharaoh sent, and behold there was not so much as one of the cattle 
of Israel dead; and Pharaoh's heart was made heavy, and he did not let the people go.      8. And Jehovah said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you in the fullness of your fists ashes of the furnace, 
and let Moses sprinkle it toward heaven unto the eyes of Pharaoh.      9. And it shall be dust over all the land of Egypt, and it shall be upon man, and upon beast, a sore breaking forth in pustules 
in all the land of Egypt.      10. And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it toward heaven; and it became a sore of pustules breaking forth on man and 
on beast.      11. And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the sore; for the sore was on the magicians and on all the Egyptians.      12. And Jehovah made firm the heart of Pharaoh, 
and he heard them not, as Jehovah had spoken unto Moses.      13. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus said Jehovah the God 
of the Hebrews, Let My people go, that they may serve Me.      14. For this time I will send all My plagues into thy heart, and into thy servants, and into thy people; that thou mayest know that there 
is no one as I in the whole earth.      15. For now I would put forth My hand, and smite thee and thy people with pestilence, and thou wouldest be cut off from the earth.      16. But yet for this 
cause have I made thee to stand, that thou mayest see My power, and that My name may be told in the whole earth.      17. As yet thou exaltest thyself against My people, in thy not letting them go.  
    18. Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now.      19. And now send, gather in thy 
cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; every man and beast, that shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought to the house, and the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.  
    20. He that feared the word of Jehovah of the servants of Pharaoh, made his servants and his cattle flee unto the houses.      21. And he that did not set his heart unto the word of Jehovah, 
left his servants and his cattle in the field.      22. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch forth thy hand toward heaven, and there shall be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, 
and upon every herb of the field in the land of Egypt.      23. And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven; and Jehovah gave voices and hail, and the fire walked unto the land, and Jehovah made 
it rain hail upon the land of Egypt.      24. And there was hail, and fire walking at the same time in the midst of the hail, very grievous, such as had not been like it in all the land of Egypt since 
it became a nation.      25. And the hail smote in all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, from man and even to beast, and the hail smote every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the 
field.      26. Only in the land of Goshen, where the sons of Israel were, was there no hail.      27. And Pharaoh sent, and called Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time; Jehovah 
is just, and I and my people are wicked.      28. Supplicate ye unto Jehovah, for there hath been enough of voices of God and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.      29. 
And Moses said unto him, As I go out of the city, I will spread out my palms unto Jehovah; and the voices shall cease, and there shall be no more hail; that thou mayest know that the earth is Jehovah's.  
    30. And thou and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the face of Jehovah God.      31. And the flax and the barley were smitten; for the barley was a ripening ear, and the flax 
was a stalk.      32. And the wheat and the spelt were not smitten, because they were hidden.      33. And Moses went out of the city from before Pharaoh, and spread out his palms unto Jehovah; and 
the voices and hail ceased and the rain was not poured out upon the earth.      34. And Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the voices had ceased, and he sinned yet more, and made heavy his heart, 
he and his servants.      35. And the heart of Pharaoh was made firm, and he did not let the sons of Israel go; as Jehovah had spoken by the hand of Moses. </p>

People therefore who either pervert, annihilate, or reject the good of love and the truth of faith residing with them do not have life within themselves. For life received from the Divine consists in 
willing what is good and believing what is true. But those who do not will what is good, only what is evil, and do not believe what is true, only what is false, possess the opposite of life. This opposite 
of life is hell and is called death; and those people are called the dead. The fact that the life of love and faith is called life and also eternal life, and those who possess it within themselves 
are called living persons; and the fact that the opposite of life is called death, and also eternal death, and those [who possess the opposite of life within themselves] are called dead persons, is 
clear from a large number of places in the Word, such as <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%204:16;%208:21,%2022;%2018:8,%209;%2019:16,%2017,%2029&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 4:16; 8:21, 22; 18:8, 9; 19:16, 17, 29</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:15,%2016,%2036;%205:24,%2025;%206:33,%2035,%2047,%2048,%2050,%2051,%2053,%2057,%2058,%2067;%208-21,%2024,%2051;%2010:10;%2011:15,%2026;%2014:6,%2019;%2017:%207;%2020:31&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3:15, 16, 36; 5:24, 25; 6:33, 35, 47, 48, 50, 51, 53, 57, 58, 67; 8-21, 24, 51; 10:10; 11:15, 26; 14:6, 19; 17: 7; 20:31</a>; and elsewhere. </p>

ad Moschen, Extende manum tuam versus caelum, et erit grando in omni terra Aegypti super hominem et super bestiam, et super omnem herbam agri in terra Aegypti. 	23.  Et extendit Moscheh baculum 
suum ad caelum, et JEHOVAH dedit voces et grandinem, et ambulavit ignis ad terram, et pluere fecit JEHOVAH grandinem super terram Aegypti. 	24.  Et fuit grando, et ignis simul ambulans in medio grandinis, 
gravis valde, quae non fuerat sicut illa in omni terra Aegypti, a quo fuit in gentem. 	25.  Et percussit grando in omni terra Aegypti omne quod in agro, ab homine et usque ad bestiam, et omnem 
herbam agri percussit grando, et omnem arborem agri confregit. 	26.  Tantum in terra Goschen, ubi filii Israelis, non fuit grando. 	27.  Et misit Pharao, et vocavit Moschen et Aharonem, et dixit ad 
illos, Peccavi vice hac, JEHOVAH justus, et ego et populus meus improbi. 	28.  Supplicate ad JEHOVAH, et satis ab esse voces DEI et grando; et dimittam vos, et non addetis stare. 	29.  Et dixit ad 
illum Moscheh, Sicut exire me urbe, expandam palmas meas ad JEHOVAH, voces cessabunt, et grando non erit amplius, propterea ut scias quod JEHOVAE terra. 	30.  Et tu et servi tui, scio quod nondum timeatis 
a facie JEHOVAE DEI. 	31.  Et linum et hordeum percussum est, quia hordeum spica maturescens, et linum culmus. 	32.  Et triticum et zea non percussa sunt, quia abdita illa. 	33.  Et egressus 
Moscheh a cum Pharaone, urbe, et expandit palmas suas ad JEHOVAM, et cessaverunt voces et grando, et pluvia non effusa est terram. 	34.  Et vidit Pharao quod cessavit pluvia, et grando, et voces, et 
addidit peccare, et aggravavit cor suum, ille et servi illius. 	35.  Et obfirmatum cor Pharaonis, et non dimisit filios Israelis, quemadmodum locutus JEHOVAH per manum Moschis. </p>
