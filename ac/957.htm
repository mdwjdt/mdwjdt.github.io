<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第957节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>957.</strong>那些在世时养成心口不一的习惯之人，尤其那些戴着友谊的面具贪恋别人财产之人，会四处游荡，无论到哪儿，都会询问他们可不可以留在那里，声称他们很穷。当被接纳后，他们出于天生的欲望贪恋他们所看到的一切。其本性一被发觉，他们就被逐出和罚款。有时，他们会遭受可怕的分解，分解的形式因他们所养成的欺骗性伪装的性质而各异。有的所遭受的分解痛苦是在全身，有的在脚上，有的在腰上，有的在胸部，有的在头部，有的仅在嘴周围。他们以难以形容的方式被来回撞击。身体各部位一起猛烈碰撞，从而被拆分，这使他们以为自己被撕成了碎片，抵抗时痛苦又会加剧。这种分解的惩罚会变着花样进行，并且隔一阵子就一次又一次地重复，直到他们对以欺骗为目的的谎言充满恐惧为止。每一种惩罚都会带走某些东西。那些实施分解的人说，他们非常乐意惩罚，以致他们不愿停下来，哪怕这意味着他们会永远惩罚下去。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]957.</strong> There are individuals who acquired for themselves in bodily life the habit of talking one way and thinking another. These people, especially the ones who pined after others' wealth under cover of friendship, wander around and ask to stay with people wherever they go, claiming to be impoverished. Once they are admitted, an inborn craving leads them to covet everything they see.<br />When their true nature is discovered, they are fined and banished and sometimes racked most painfully — in different ways, depending on the nature of the facade they adopted in order to delude. In some cases the whole body is ripped apart; in others it is the lower legs, or the lower torso,{*1} the upper torso, the head, or just the part around the mouth. They are jostled back and forth in indescribable ways. Their body parts are violently smashed together and torn off in the process, so that they imagine they have been shredded into tiny pieces. Resistance is also induced in them so as to increase the pain.<br />Such are the ways — with a great deal of variety — in which people are punished by racking. The punishments are repeated at intervals enough times to instill in them a terror and horror for false, deceptive speech. Each repetition takes away a little more of their desire.<br />Those doing the shredding said they enjoy inflicting punishment so much that not in all eternity would they want to leave off.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The Latin word here translated "lower torso" is lumbi, a plural noun that has been traditionally rendered "loins." Because the Latin of the eighteenth century assigned somewhat different divisions to the human body than does the English of today, this Latin word has no satisfactory equivalent in current English. Swedenborg usually uses it to refer to the whole area from just below the waist to the knees (see, for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_957/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_9959" target=_top>Secrets of Heaven 9959:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_957/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_9961" target=_top>9961:1</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_957/swedenborg_conjugial-love-rogers_510#subsection-2-3" target=_top>Marriage Love 510:3</a>), although occasionally he appears to differentiate the lumbi from the lower thighs or the knees (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_957/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3639" target=_top>Secrets of Heaven 3639</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_957/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5051" target=_top>5051</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_957/swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_65" target=_top>Heaven and Hell 65</a>).

Those who in the life of the body have contracted a habit of saying one thing and thinking another, especially those who under the appearance of friendship have longed for the possessions of others, 
wander about, and wherever they come ask whether they may stay there, saying that they are poor; and when they are received they from innate desire long for all they see. As soon as their character is 
detected they are driven out and fined; and sometimes they are miserably racked in various ways in accordance with the nature of the deceitful simulation which they have contracted, some being racked 
in the whole body, some in the feet, some in the loins, some in the breast, some in the head, and some only in the region of the mouth. They are knocked backward and forward in a way that is indescribable; 
there are violent collisions of the parts, thus pullings asunder, so that they believe themselves to be torn into small bits; and resistance is induced, to increase the pain. Such punishments of 
discerption take place with great variety, and at intervals are repeated again and again, until the sufferers are penetrated with fear and horror at false statements made with an intention to deceive. 
Each punishing takes away something. The discerptors said that they are so delighted to punish that they are not willing to desist, even should it go on to eternity. </p>

People who during their lifetime have developed the habit of saying one thing and thinking another, especially those who beneath a show of friendship have gazed with envy on other people's wealth, wander 
around and ask wherever they go whether they can stay with those persons they meet. They say they are poor, and on being welcomed they gaze enviously from innate desire on all that they see. When 
it is discovered what they are really like, they are fined and expelled from there. Sometimes they suffer dreadful tearings apart which vary according to the habit they have developed of deceitful pretence. 
Some suffer it over the whole body, others in the feet, others in the loins, others in the breast, others in the head, and others only round the region of the mouth. They are hammered this way 
and that, back and forth, in ways defying description. Violent crushings together of parts of the body and so wrenchings apart take place, causing them to believe that they have been torn to bits. Resistance 
is also added so as to intensify the pain. Such are the punishments that involve being torn apart, with many variations, to be repeated again and again at intervals until a dread and horror of 
deceiving by lying is ground into them. Each punishment inflicted takes something away. Those who did the tearing apart said that they took such delight in inflicting punishment that they had no wish 
to stop even if it meant their carrying on with it for ever. </p>

</p><b>957.</b>
Qui in vita corporis naturam sibi contraxerunt aliud loquendi et aliud cogitandi, cumprimis qui sub amicitiae specie aliorum opibus inhiarunt, ii vagantur circum et ubicumque veniunt, interrogant num 
cum iis esse possint, dicendo se pauperes,et cum recipiuntur, ex innata cupidine inhiant omnibus; cum detecti quod tales, expelluntur cum mulcta, et quandoque miserabiliter discerpuntur diversimode 
secundum dolosae simulationis naturam quam contraxerunt, quidam quoad totum corpus, quidam quoad pedes, quidam quoad lumbos, quidam quoad pectus, quidam quoad caput, et quidam solum quoad regionem oris; 
adiguntur in reciprocas reverberationes, quae quales sunt, non describi potest; sunt collisiones partium violentae et sic distractiones, ut se credant in minutas partes discerptos; inducitur etiam 
renisus ut augeatur dolor; tales discerptionis poenae sunt cum multa varietate, et post intervalla toties repetuntur usque dum terror et horror incutiatur per falsiloquia fallendi; quaevis punitio aliquid 
demit.  Discerptores dicebant quod ita delectentur punire ut non desistere vellent, si vel foret in aeternum. </p>
