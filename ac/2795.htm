<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2795节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>2795．“就回到你们这里来”表此后的结合。这也是显而易见的，无需解释。本章论述的是主最严厉、最内在的试探，故经上描述了主在经历这些状态时所具有的一切状态。第三节描述了第一状态，本节描述了第二状态，接下来的这一节和此后剩下的几节则描述了第三状态。但以一般人的理解力，这些事无法解释清楚，除非人们先了解很多事，不仅了解此处“亚伯拉罕”所代表的主的神性，还了解“以撒”所代表的其神性人，了解此处“孩子”所表示的该理性的状态，也就是祂进入并经受试探的争战之时的状态。除此之外，人必须了解何为第一理性及其性质，以及第一理性所具有的属世层，还有这二者联结时的状态的性质，和它们或多或少有所分离时的状态的性质。而且，人有必要了解关于试探的很多事，如何为外在和内在的试探，并由此了解何为主的最内在、最严厉的试探，也就是本意的主题。只要所有这些事依旧未知，本节所包含的事就绝无可能描述清楚。即便以最清晰的方式描述它们，它们仍显得模糊。对天使来说，由于他们居于从主流出的天堂之光中，故所有这些事都是显而易见的，甚至是蒙福的，因为这些事是最属天的。<br />在此，我们只说明：主处于神性本身时，根本不可能受到试探，因为神性无限超越一切试探。不过，祂的人性有可能受到试探。这就是为何主在即将经受最严厉、最内在的试探时，会将第一人性，也就是说它的理性层和属世层与自己联结起来，如第三节所描述的，此后又与它们分离，如本节所述，然而仍留有某些特性，祂经由这些特性受到试探的原因。正因如此，经上在此没有说“我儿子以撒”，而是说“孩子”。“孩子”表示处于这种具体状态，也就是说处于真理状态、预备经受最严厉和最内在的试探争战的神圣理性（参看<a href="2793.htm">2793</a>节）。无论神性本身，还是神性人，都不可能受到试探。对此，仅从以下事实，谁都能清楚看出来：即便天使也无法靠近神性，制造试探的灵人更不能，就不用提一切地狱了。由此明显可知，为何主降世披上人性状态本身及其软弱。只有这样，祂的人性才能受到试探，祂才能藉着试探征服地狱，使每一个事物都顺从，恢复秩序，拯救已距离至高的神性如此遥远的人类。</p>

And will come again to you. That this signifies conjunction afterwards, is also evident without explication. As the Lord's most grievous and inmost temptations are treated of in this chapter, all the 
states that He assumed when He underwent these temptations are described. The first state is described in the third verse, the second state in this verse, the third state in the verse next following, 
and the rest afterwards. But these states cannot be expounded to the common apprehension unless many things are first known, not only respecting the Lord's Divine, as here represented by Abraham, but 
also respecting His Divine Human as represented by Isaac, and respecting the state of this rational when He engaged in and underwent the combats of temptation (this being the "boy"); and also what and 
of what quality the former rational was, and also the natural which it had; and likewise what the state was when the one was adjoined to the other, and what the state was when they were more or less 
separated. Moreover many things concerning temptations must be known, as what exterior and interior temptations are, and hence what were the inmost and most grievous temptations the Lord had, and which 
are treated of in this chapter. So long as these things are unknown, the things contained in this verse cannot possibly be described to the comprehension; and if they should be described, even most 
clearly, they would still appear obscure. To the angels, who are in the light of heaven from the Lord, all these things are manifest and clear, indeed blessed, because they are most heavenly.  [2] Here 
we will merely say that the Lord could not be tempted at all when He was in the Divine Itself, for the Divine is infinitely above all temptation; but He could be tempted as to His human. This is the 
reason why when He was to undergo the most grievous and inmost temptations, He adjoined to Himself the prior human, that is, the rational and the natural of it, as described in verse 3; and why He 
afterwards separated Himself from these, as is said in this verse; but nevertheless retaining something by means of which He could be tempted; which is the reason why it is not here said, "Isaac my son," 
but "the boy," by whom is meant the Divine rational in such a state, namely, in a state of truth, prepared for the most grievous and inmost combats of temptations (see n. 2793). That neither the Divine 
Itself nor the Divine Human could be tempted, must be evident to everyone simply from the fact that not even the angels can approach the Divine, much less the spirits who induce temptations, and 
still less the hells. Hence it is manifest why the Lord came into the world, and put on the human state itself with its infirmity; for thus He could be tempted as to the human, and by means of the temptations 
subjugate the hells, and reduce each and all things to obedience and into order, and save the human race which had removed itself so far away from the supreme Divine. </p>

'And return to you' means conjunction after that. This too becomes clear without explanation. The subject of this chapter being the Lord's severest and inmost temptations, all the states are described 
which He assumed when undergoing those temptations. The first state is described in verse 3, the second state in the present verse, the third state in the verse that follows next and in all the rest 
after that. But these states cannot possibly be explained to the ordinary mind unless many other things are known first, not only about the Lord's Divine which is represented here by 'Abraham' but also 
about His Divine Human which is represented by 'Isaac', and about the state - when He went into and underwent the conflicts brought about by temptations- of this Rational, meant here by 'the boy'. 
In addition to this one has to know what the first rational was, and the nature of it, as well as the natural that went with that rational, and also the nature of the state when one was joined to the 
other, and the nature of the state when they were more or less separated. What is more, one needs to know many things regarding temptations, such as what exterior and interior temptations are, and from 
this what were the inmost and severest temptations that were the Lord's, which are the subject in this chapter. As long as all these matters remain unknown the things within this verse cannot possibly 
be described intelligibly. And if they were described, even in the clearest possible manner, they would still appear obscure. To angels, since they dwell in the light of heaven flowing from the Lord, 
all these matters are plain and clear, and indeed blessed because these matters are supremely heavenly. </p>

 This alone need be said here, that the Lord could not possibly be tempted when He was 
one with the Divine itself, for the Divine is infinitely above all temptation. But He could experience temptation as to His human. This is the reason why, when He was to undergo the severest and inmost 
temptations, He joined the first human to Himself, that is to say, the rational and the natural degrees of it, as described in verse 3, and after that separated Himself from them, as stated in the present 
verse, though still retaining certain traits through which He could be tempted. It is for this reason that here Isaac is not spoken of as 'my son' but as 'the boy', an expression used to mean the 
Divine Rational in that particular state, that is to say, in a state of truth, equipped for the severest and inmost conflicts brought about by temptations, see <a href="2793.htm">2793</a>. The truth that neither the Divine 
itself nor the Divine Human could be tempted may become clear to anyone merely from the fact that not even angels can approach the Divine, still less the spirits who bring temptations about, and least 
of all the hells. From all this it is evident why the Lord came into the world and took on the human state of being with all its weakness, for by doing so He was able to be tempted as regards the 
human and by means of temptations to suppress the hells. He was able to restore every single thing to obedience and to order, and to save the human race which had removed itself so far away from the Supreme Divine. </p>

`Et revertemur ad vos': quod significet conjunctionem dein, etiam constare potest absque explicatione. Quia in hoc capite agitur de gravissimis et intimis tentationibus Domini, describuntur omnes status 
quos suscepit, cum illas subiret; primus status describitur vers. 3; alter status in hoc versu, tertius status in versu mox sequente, et ceteri dein; sed illi ad captum vulgarem exponi nequeunt nisi 
plura prius sciantur, non modo de Divino Domini quod hic per `Abrahamum' repraesentatur, sed etiam de Humano Divino Ipsius quod per `Jishakum {1},' et de statu hujus Rationalis cum pugnas tentationum 
iniret et subiret, quod hic est `puer'; praeter quid et quale rationale prius, ut et naturale quod isti, tum qualis status cum adjunctum unum alteri, et qualis status cum separata magis et minus; 
insuper scientur plura de tentationibus, ut quid tentationes exteriores et interiores, inde quid tentationes intimae et gravissimae quae Domino, de quibus in hoc capite; quamdiu haec ignorantur, nusquam 
describi ad captum possunt illa quae in hoc versu; et si describerentur, etiam clarissime, usque apparebunt obscura; angelis quia in luce caeli a Domino, sunt haec omnia manifesta et clara, immo beata 
quia caelestissima. Hic modo dicendum, quod Dominus nusquam potuit 2 tentari cum fuit in Ipso Divino, Divinum enim est infinite supra omnem tentationem, sed potuit quoad humanum; haec causa est quod 
cum gravissimas et intimas tentationes subiret, adjunxerit Sibi humanum prius, nempe ejus rationale et naturale, ut in vers. 3 describitur, et dein quod separaverit Se ab illis, ut in hoc versu dicitur, 
at usque quod retinuerit tale per quod tentari posset, quae causa est quod hic non dicatur Jishakus `filius meus,' sed `puer,' per quem quod intelligatur Rationale Divinum in tali statu, nempe in 
statu veri accinctum gravissimis et intimis tentationum pugnis, videatur n. 2793: quod non Ipsum Divinum, nec Divinum Humanum posset tenta unicuivis constare potest, solum ex eo quod ne quidem angeli 
Divinum approximare possint, minus spiritus qui tentationes inducent, et adhuc minus inferna; inde patet cur Dominus in mundum venit et ipsum humanum statum cum infirmo ejus induit, sic enim potuit 
quoad humanum tentari, et per tentationes subjugare inferna, omnia et singula ad oboedientiam et in ordinem redigere, ac salvare humanum genus, quod tam longe se removit a supremo Divino.      @1 Isacum$ </p>
