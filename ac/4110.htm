<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4110节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4110.</strong>“当时拉班给羊群剪羊毛去了”表“拉班的羊群”所表良善的功用和目的的状态。这从“剪（羊毛）”和“羊群”的含义清楚可知：“剪（羊毛）”是指功用，因而是指目的，因为功用就是目的，如下文所述；“羊群”是指良善（<a href="343.htm">343</a>，<a href="2566.htm">2566</a>节）。由此明显可知，“剪羊毛去了”表示功用和目的的状态。此处所论述的主题是“拉班”所表中间或居间良善与藉着它所获得的“雅各”所表良善的分离。不过，该分离的性质若非通过处于那良善的灵人的社群，以及它到达人那里所出自的人，就不得而知。对于这个问题，我从自己的亲身经历得知以下事实。<br />灵人有善的，有恶的，也有中间类型的。人在重生期间，这些灵人便与人相联，以便人能通过他们被引入纯正的良善与真理，主藉着天使实现这一切。但是，他们是那种除了一段时间外，与要重生的这个人并不一致的灵人或灵人社群；因而他们履行完自己的功用后，就被分离。其分离的方式各种各样：善灵是一种方式，中间类型的灵人是另一种方式，恶灵则又是一种方式。善灵是在不知不觉的情况下被分离的，因为善灵从主的美意知道，他们无论到哪儿，或无论主将他们转到哪里，他们都会一切安好的。但中间类型的灵人则以多种方式被分离，直到他们在自由中退离。他们会返回到自己的良善状态，因而返回到他们所提供的功用和所关注的目的的状态，以便他们在这种状态下能体验到他们自己的快乐和幸福。不过，他们因在之前与正在重生之人的联系中找到乐趣，故屡次返回，然后再从这种联系中被放出来，直到他们不再以与他同住为乐，从而在自由中离开。其实恶灵也是在自由中被移除的，不过，这种自由仅仅在他们看来是自由。他们与正在重生的人相联是为了引入必须被驱散的消极思想和感觉，好叫此人在真理与良善上更好地得以强化。当他开始在这些真理与良善上得以强化时，这些灵人便不再以与他同住为快乐，而是以与他分离为快乐。他们便以这种方式通过伴随其快乐的自由感觉而被分离。这就是人在重生时，灵人与他分离的情形，因而是他在良善与真理上的状态改变的情形。<br />至于“给羊群剪羊毛”表示致用，这从以下事实明显可知：就内义而言，“给羊群剪羊毛”无非是一种功用，因为羊毛由此而得。“剪羊毛”表示功用，这一点可从以下摩西五经的经文明显看出来：<br />你牛群羊群中头生的，凡是公的都要分别为圣，归耶和华你的神。牛群中头生的不可用它耕地；羊群中头生的不可剪毛；你年年要耶和华你神面前吃，在耶和华所选择的地方吃它。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申15.19.htm">15:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申15.20.htm">20</a>）<br />此处“羊群中头生的不可剪毛”表示不可将它置于家用。由于“剪羊毛”表示功用，故“剪羊毛”和“出席剪羊毛的节日”就包括在重要的职责和功能之列，这一点可从论到犹大的经文看出来，即“他剪羊毛”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创38.12.htm">38:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创38.13.htm">13</a>），也可从撒母耳记下中论到大卫众子的经文看出来：<br />过了二年，在以法莲境内的巴力夏琐，押沙龙有了剪羊毛的人；押沙龙请了王的众子。押沙龙来到王那里，说，看哪，现在你的仆人有剪羊毛的人，请王和王的臣仆与你的仆人同去。（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下13.23.htm">13:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下13.24.htm">24</a>）</p>

And Laban was gone to shear his flock. That this signifies a state of use and of an end of good, which is the "flock of Laban," is evident from the signification of "shearing," as being use, and thus 
end, for use is end (concerning which below); and from the signification of "a flock," as being good (n. 343, 2566). This shows that a state of use and of end is signified by "going to shear." The subject 
here treated of is the separation of the mediate good which is "Laban," from the good procured by it which is "Jacob;" but how the case is with this separation cannot be known except from the societies 
of the spirits who are in that good, and from whom it flows in with man, in regard to which I may state from experience the facts which follow.  [2] There are good spirits, there are spirits 
of a middle sort, and there are evil spirits, who are adjoined to man during his regeneration, to the end that by their means he may be introduced into genuine goods and truths, and this by the Lord by 
means of angels; but they are such spirits or societies of spirits as are not in agreement with the person to be regenerated, except for a time; and therefore, when they have performed their use, they 
are separated. Their separation is effected in various ways-that of the good spirits in one way, that of the spirits of a middle sort in another way, and that of the evil spirits in still another way. 
The separation of the good spirits is effected without their being aware of it, for they know that of the Lord's good pleasure it is well with them wherever they may be, or whithersoever they may 
be by Him transferred. But the separation of the spirits of a middle sort is effected by many means, even until they withdraw in freedom. For they are remitted into the state of their good, and therefore 
into a state of use and of the consequent end, in order that they may perceive therein their delight and their bliss. But inasmuch as they had found pleasure in their previous association with the 
regenerating man, they are by turns brought to it and sent away from it, until at last they feel discomfort in any further stay, and so withdraw in freedom. The evil spirits also are indeed removed in 
freedom, but in a freedom which only appears to them as freedom. They are adjoined for the purpose of introducing opposing ideas and feelings which are to be rejected, in order that the man may be the 
better confirmed in truths and goods; and when he begins to be confirmed in these, they perceive a discomfort in remaining, and a delight in separation, and in this manner they are separated in a freedom 
that comes of their delight. Such is the case with the separation of the spirits from a man when he is being regenerated, and consequently with the changes of his state as to good and truth. [3] 
That "to shear a flock" denotes to perform use, is evident from the fact that in the internal sense the "shearing of a flock" is nothing else than use, for wool is obtained thereby. That "sheepshearing" 
denotes use, is also plain from these words in Moses: </p>
<p>     Every firstling male which is born of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto Jehovah thy God; thou shalt do no work with the 
firstling of thine ox, nor shear the firstling of thy flock; but thou shalt eat it before Jehovah thy God year by year in the place which Jehovah shall choose (Deut. 15:19); </p>
<p>where "not to shear the 
firstling of the flock" denotes not to make a household use from it. As "sheep-shearing" signified use, it was in those days an office and function of distinction to shear the flock and to be present 
at the shearings, as may be seen from what is said of Judah, that "he sheared his flock" (Gen. 38:12, 13); and of the sons of David, in the second book of Samuel: </p>
<p>     It came to pass after two years 
of days, that Absalom had sheep-shearers in Baalhazor, which is in Ephraim; and Absalom called all the king's sons; and Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now thy servant hath sheep-shearers; 
let the king, I pray thee, and his servants, go with thy servant (2 Sam. 13:23-24). </p>

'Laban had gone to shear his flock' means a state of use and an end in view involving the good meant by 'Laban's flock'. This is clear from the meaning of 'shearing' as use, and so the end in view, for 
the use that is served is the end in view, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'flock' as good, dealt with in <a href="343.htm">343</a>, <a href="2566.htm">2566</a>. From this it is evident that the state of use and an end in view is meant 
by 'going to shear'. The subject now is the separation of intermediate good meant by 'Laban' from the good meant by 'Jacob' which was acquired from that intermediate good. But the nature of this separation 
cannot be known except from those communities of spirits who are governed by that good and from whom it comes to man. But let some facts be given on this matter which I have learned from my 
experiences. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
  There are good spirits, there are spirits of an intermediate kind, and there are evil spirits. These are linked to a person when he is being regenerated, to the end that through them 
he may be introduced into genuine goods and truths - which the Lord effects by means of angels. But they are the kinds of spirits or communities of spirits who do not accord, except for a time, with 
the one to be regenerated, and therefore when they have performed their use they are separated. The separation of them is effected in differing ways - the separation of the good spirits in one way, 
that of the spirits of the intermediate kind in another, and that of the evil spirits in yet another. The separation of the good spirits is effected without their being directly conscious of it, for 
they know from the Lord's good pleasure that all is well with them wherever they are or to wherever the Lord takes them. But the separation of the spirits of the intermediate kind is effected by many 
means until they depart in freedom. They are returned to the state of their own good, and consequently to the state of the use they serve and of the end they therefore have in view, so that in that state 
they may experience the delight and blessing that are their own. But because they have derived pleasure out of their previous connection with the one who is being regenerated they are several times 
returned to and then released from that connection until they no longer take any delight in staying with him and so depart in freedom. Evil spirits too are indeed removed in freedom, but in a kind of 
freedom which appears to them to be freedom. They are linked to the person who is being regenerated so that they may introduce negative ideas which have to be dispelled, the intention being that this 
person may be strengthened all the more in truths and goods. And when he starts to be strengthened in these, those spirits take no delight in staying with him, only in separation from him. In this way 
they are separated by a feeling of freedom that accompanies their delight. This is how the separation takes place of spirits present with a person when he is being regenerated, and how as a consequence 
changes of his state as regards good and truth are brought about. </p>

 As regards 'sheering a flock' meaning performing a use, this is evident from the consideration that the shearing of a flock 
in the internal sense means nothing else than a use that is served, for wool is obtained in this way. That the shearing of a flock means a use that is served is also evident from the following in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Every 
firstborn that is born among your herds and among your flocks you shall sanctify to Jehovah your God; you shall do no work by means of the firstborn of your oxen, and you shall not shear 
the first born of your flock. But before Jehovah your God you shall eat it year by year in the place which Jehovah will choose. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2015:19,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 15:19, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'not shearing the firstborn of the flock' is a 
command not to put it to a domestic use. Because 'the shearing of a flock' meant a use that is served, 'shearing the flock' and 'being present at shearings' are included among important duties and functions, 
as becomes clear from the reference in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2038:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 38:12, 13</a>, to Judah shearing his flock, and from that to the sons of David in <a href="2.htm">2</a> Samuel, </p>
<blockquote>
So it was after two full years, that Absalom had shearers 
in Baalhazor, which is in Ephraim; and Absalom called all the king's sons. And Absalom came to the king and said, Behold, I beg you, your servant has shearers; let the king go, I beg you, and his servants, 
with your servant. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2%20Sam%2013:23,%2024&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">2 Sam 13:23, 24</a>.

`Laban iverat ad tondendum gregem suum': quod significet statum usus et finis boni quod grex Labanis, constat ex significatione `tondere' quod sit usus, ita finis, nam usus est finis, de qua sequitur: 
et ex significatione `gregis' quod sit bonum, de qua n. 343, 2566; inde patet quod status usus et finis significetur per `ire ad tondendum'.  Agitur nunc de separatione boni medii quod est `Laban,' 
a bono comparato inde quod est `Jacob'; sed quomodo se {1} cum separatione habet, nec sciri potest quam a societatibus spirituum qui in bono Illo sunt et a quibus illud apud hominem influit, 
de qua re ab experientia haec licet referre: [2] sunt spiritus boni et sunt spiritus mediae sortis et sunt spiritus mali, qui adjunguntur homini cum regeneratur, ob finem ut introducatur {2} per illos 
(o)in bona et vera {3} genuina, et hoc mediis angelis a Domino, sed sunt tales spiritus seu societates spirituum qui cum regenerando non concordant, modo quoad tempus, quare cum usum praestiterant, 
separantur; separatio illorum fit diversimode, et aliter separatio spirituum bonorum, aliter spirituum mediae sortis, et aliter spirituum malorum; separatio spirituum bonorum fit quando id non 
sciunt, ex beneplacito Domini scientes quod illis bene sit ubicumque sunt, seu quocumque a Domino transferuntur; separatio autem spirituum mediae sortis fit per plura media, usque dum in libero recedunt, 
remittuntur enim in statum boni {4} sui, proinde in statum usus et finis inde {5}, ut ibi percipiant jucundum suum et beatum suum, sed quia ex {6} consortio priore traxerunt volupe, reducuntur 
aliquoties, et remittuntur aliquoties, usque dum sentiunt injucundum in diutius morando et sic in libero recedunt; spiritus autem mali quidem etiam in libero removentur, sed in libero quod illis 
apparet ut liberum; </p>
<p>adjunguntur ut inducant negativa quae discutienda, ut melius confirmetur homo in veris et bonis; cumque homo incipit confirmari in illis, tunc injucundum percipiunt, et jucundum 
in separatione, ita ex libero quod est jucundi illorum, separantur: ita se habet cum separatione spirituum apud hominem cum regeneratur, proinde ita cum mutationibus status ejus quoad bonum et 
verum. {7}  [3] Quod `tondere gregem' sit usum facere, patet ex eo quod tonsio gregis in sensu interno non aliud sit quam usus, nam lana inde: quod tonsio gregis sit usus, etiam patet ab his apud Mosen,  
         Omne primogenitum, quod nascitur in armento tuo, et in      grege tuo, sanctificabis Jehovae Deo tuo; non facies opus      per primogenitum bovis tui, et non tondebis primogenitum  
    gregis tui; sed coram Jehovah Deo tuo comedes illud      quotannis in loco quem elegerit Jehovah, Deut. xv 19 [, 20]; </p>
<p>ubi `non tondere primogenitum gregis' est non usum domesticum inde facere: 
{8} quia `tonsio gregis' significabat usum, ideo' inter officia et munia insignia tunc temporis fuit `tondere gregem, et adesse tonsionibus'; ut constare potest a Jehudah, quod `tonderet gregem suum', 
Gen. xxxviii 12, 13; et ex filiis Davidis, in libro 2 Samuelis,           {9} Fuit post biennium dierum, et erant tonsores      Abshalomo in Baalhazor, quod in Ephraimo, et vocavit      Abshalom 
omnes filios regis, et venit Abshalom ad regem, et      dixit, Ecce quaeso tonsores servo tuo, eat quaeso rex, et      servi sui {10} cum servo tuo, xiii 23, 24.      @1 after separatione$
