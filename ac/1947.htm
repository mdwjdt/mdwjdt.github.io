<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1947节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1947.</strong>“因为耶和华听见了你的苦楚”表因为它使自己臣服。这从前面有关“顺服并苦待自己”的论述（<a href="1937.htm">1937</a>节）清楚可知，“顺服并苦待自己”表示臣服于内在人的掌控之下，那里讨论了这种臣服，并说明它就在于自我强迫。那里还说明，自我强迫里面有自由，即有自发自愿之物，自我强迫不同于被强迫。又说明，若没有这自由，即自发自愿性，人无法被改造并接受任何天堂的自我；还进一步说明，试探期间的自由要多于非试探期间的，尽管表面看似相反。事实上，那时，这自由会随着恶与假的攻击而愈加强大，并被主强化，以便天堂的自我能被赋予此人。由于这个原因，当我们处在试探当中时，主与我们靠得更近。那里同样说明，主从不强迫任何人。凡被迫思想真理并行出善事之人都不会被改造，反而愈加思想虚假、意愿邪恶。所有强迫都有这种后果，对此，我们可从生活中的经验教训看出来，并从中知道两件事：第一，人的良知不容许被强迫；第二，我们会追求被禁的事。<br />因此，很明显，主不悦纳并非出于自由之物，也就是说，并非出于自发自愿之物。因为人若通过不自由敬拜主，就是通过不是自己的东西敬拜。在这种情况下，驱动者和被驱动者都是被迫的外在，而内在不存在，要不然就排斥，甚至与之对立。人在重生时，通过主所赋予他的自由强迫自己并顺服，甚至苦待他的理性，是为了其理性能使自己臣服，他由此接受天堂的自我。然后，这自我会被主逐渐完善，变得越来越自由，以致它变成对良善和源于这善之真理的情感，并拥有快乐。这情感和快乐里面有诸如天使所体验的幸福。这自由就是主在约翰福音中所论及的：<br />真理必叫你们得以自由。儿子若叫你们自由，你们就真自由了。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.32.htm">8:32</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.36.htm">36</a>）<br />那些没有良知的人完全不知道这自由是什么，因为他们将自由置于随心所欲、毫无限制的思想和谈论虚假、意愿和行出恶事的感觉中，而不是控制、挫败这类欲望，更不用说苦待它们了。然而，这完全是自由的反面，如主在同一福音书中所教导的：<br />凡犯罪的都是罪的奴隶。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.34.htm">8:34</a>）<br />他们从与其同在的地狱灵那里获得这种奴隶般的自由，这些地狱灵将其注入到他们里面。当这些地狱灵的生命占据他们时，其爱和欲望也会占据他们。当肮脏污秽的快乐吹在他们身上，他们仿佛被水流带走时，他们自以为处在自由中，但它却是地狱的自由。地狱自由和天堂自由的区别在于，前者导致死亡，将他们拖入地狱；而后者，也就是天堂自由则应许给予生命，将他们提入天堂。<br />一切真正的内在敬拜都是出于自由，无一出自强迫。并且，敬拜若不出于自由，就不是内在敬拜。这从圣言明显可知，如甘心祭、还愿祭、平安祭、感恩祭，它们都被称作供物和祭品（对此，参看民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.3.htm">15:3</a>等；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申12.6.htm">12:6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申16.10.htm">16:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申16.11.htm">11</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申23.23.htm">23:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申23.24.htm">24</a>等）。诗篇：<br />我要把甘心祭献给你；耶和华啊，我要称赞你的名，这名本为美好。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗54.8.htm">54:8</a>）<br />再如摩西书中所提及百姓为制造帐幕和圣衣所送来的捐献物或收集物：<br />你对以色列人说，当为我送礼物来，凡甘心乐意的，你们就可以收下归我。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.2.htm">25:2</a>）<br />还有：<br />凡乐意献的，可以拿耶和华的礼物来。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出35.5.htm">35:5</a>）<br />而且，使理性人顺服，或苦待它（出于自由，如前所述）也由节日期间苦待灵魂来代表，如摩西书所说：<br />这要作你们永远的定例：每逢七月初十日，你们要苦待（affliction）自己的灵魂。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.29.htm">16:29</a>）<br />还有：<br />七月初十是赎罪日，你们要守为圣会，并要苦待（affliction）自己的灵魂。当这日，凡苦待自己的灵魂，必从民中剪除。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.27.htm">23:27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.29.htm">29</a>）<br />正因如此，没有发酵的无酵饼被称作困苦饼（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申16.2.htm">16:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申16.3.htm">3</a>）。<br />诗篇这样论及“苦待”（affliction）：<br />耶和华啊，谁能寄居你的帐幕？谁能住在你的圣山？就是行为正直、做事公义的人。他发了誓，虽然自己吃亏（affliction），也不更改。。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗15.1.htm">15:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗15.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗15.4.htm">4</a>）<br />“吃亏” （affliction）表示掌控和制服从外在人升腾到理性人的恶与假，这一点从前面所述清楚可知。因此，“苦待”（affliction）并不意味着我们要将自己置于贫穷、不幸中，或抛弃一切肉体快乐，因为以这种方式邪恶并不能被掌控和制服。事实上，这有可能唤起其它一些邪恶，即克己的功德感。而且，人的自由容许信的善与真能播种于其中，如同它的土地，且只能播种在它里面。“苦待”（affliction）也表试探（参看<a href="1846.htm">1846</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1947</b></p><p><b>1947.</b>
Because Jehovah hath hearkened to thine affliction. That this signifies while it was submitting itself, is evident from what was said above (n. 1937), in that to "humble and afflict oneself" denotes 
to submit to the sovereign control of the internal man, which submission was there treated of, and it is shown that this is to compel oneself; also that in compelling oneself there is freedom, that is, 
what is spontaneous and voluntary, by which compelling oneself is distinguished from being compelled. It was also shown that without this freedom, that is, spontaneity or willingness, man cannot possibly 
be reformed and receive any heavenly Own; and further that there is more of freedom in temptations than out of them, although the contrary appears to be the case, for the freedom is then stronger 
in proportion to the assaults of evils and falsities, and is strengthened by the Lord in order that a heavenly Own may be conferred upon the man; and for this reason the Lord is more present with us 
while we are in temptations. It was shown further that the Lord never compels anyone; for he who is compelled to think what is true and do what is good is not reformed, but thinks falsity and wills evil 
all the more. All compulsion has this effect, as we may see from the records and examples of life, for from them we know these two things: that consciences do not suffer themselves to be compelled, 
and that we strive after what is forbidden. Moreover everyone desires to pass from non-freedom into freedom, for this belongs to man's life.  [2] Hence it is evident that anything which is not from 
freedom, that is, which is not from what is spontaneous or voluntary, is not acceptable to the Lord; for when anyone worships the Lord from what is not free, he worships from nothing that is his own, 
and in this case it is the external which moves, that is, which is moved, from being compelled, while the internal is null, or resistant, or is even contradictory to it. While man is being regenerated, 
he, from the freedom with which he is gifted by the Lord, exercises self-compulsion, and humbles and even afflicts his rational, in order that it may submit itself, and thereby he receives a heavenly 
Own, which is afterwards gradually perfected by the Lord, and is made more and more free, so that it becomes the affection of good and thence of truth, and has delight, and in both the freedom and 
the delight there is happiness like that of angels. This freedom is what the Lord speaks of in John: </p>
<p>     The truth shall make* you free; if the Son makes you free, you shall be* free indeed (John 8:32, 
36).  [3] The nature of this freedom is utterly unknown to those who do not possess conscience, for they make freedom consist in doing as they please and in the license of thinking and speaking what 
is false, of willing and doing what is evil, and of not compelling and humbling, still less of afflicting such desires; when yet the very reverse is the case, as the Lord also teaches in the same 
gospel: </p>
<p>     Everyone that committeth sin is the servant of sin (John 8:34). This slavish freedom they receive from the infernal spirits who are with them and who infuse it, and when they are in the 
life of these spirits they are also in their loves and cupidities, and an impure and excrementitious delight breathes upon them, and when they are being as it were carried away by the torrent, they suppose 
themselves to be in freedom, but it is infernal freedom. The difference between this infernal freedom and heavenly freedom is that the one is that of death, and drags them down to hell, while the 
other, or heavenly freedom, is of life and uplifts them to heaven.  [4] That all true internal worship comes from freedom, and none from compulsion, and that if worship is not from freedom it is not 
internal worship, is evident from the Word, as from the sacrifices that were freewill offerings or vows, or offerings of peace or of thanksgiving; which were called "gifts" and "offerings" (concerning 
which see Num. 15:3, etc.; Deut. 12:6; 16:10-11; 23:23-24). So in David: </p>
<p>     With a free-will offering will I sacrifice unto Thee; I will confess to Thy name, O Jehovah, for it is good (Ps. 54:6). So 
again from the contribution or collection which they were to make for the Tabernacle, and for the garments of holiness, spoken of in Moses: </p>
<p>     Speak unto the sons of Israel, and let them take 
for Me an offering; from every man whom his heart impels willingly ye shall take My offering (Exod. 25:2). And again: </p>
<p>     Whosoever is of a willing heart let him bring it, Jehovah's offering (Exod. 
35:5). [5] Moreover the humiliation of the rational man, or its affliction (from freedom, as before said), was also represented by the affliction of souls on days of solemnity, as mentioned in Moses: </p>
<p> 
    It shall be a statute of eternity unto you; in the seventh month, on the tenth of the month, ye shall afflict your souls (Lev. 16:29). And again: </p>
<p>     On the tenth of the seventh month, this 
is the day of expiations; there shall be a holy convocation unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; every soul that shall not have afflicted itself in that same day, shall be cut off from his peoples 
(Lev. 23:27, 29). It was for this reason that the unleavened bread, in which there was nothing fermented, is called the "bread of affliction" (Deut. 16:2-3).  [6] "Affliction" is thus spoken of 
in David: </p>
<p>     Jehovah, who shall sojourn in Thy tent? who shall dwell in the mountain of Thy holiness? He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness; he that sweareth to afflict himself, and 
changeth not (Ps. 15:1-2, 4). That "affliction" denotes the mastering and subjugation of the evils and falsities that rise up from the external man into the rational, may be seen from what has been 
said. Thus "affliction" does not mean that we should plunge ourselves into poverty and wretchedness, or that we should renounce all bodily delights, for in this way evil is not mastered and subjugated; 
and moreover some other evil may be aroused, namely, a sense of merit on account of the renunciation; and besides, man's freedom suffers, in which alone, as in ground, the good and truth of faith can 
be inseminated. (Concerning "affliction" as denoting also temptation, see above, n. 1846.) * Facit and estis; but faciet and eritis n. 9096. [Rotch ed.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1947</b></p><p><b>1947.</b>
'Because Jehovah has hearkened to your affliction' means since it was submitting itself. This is clear from what has been stated above in <a href="1937.htm">1937</a> about 'humiliating oneself and flinging oneself down' as 
meaning submitting oneself beneath the controlling power of the internal man, which submission was discussed there and was shown to consist in self-compulsion. It was also shown that in self-compulsion 
there is freedom, that is, what is willing and spontaneous, and that this distinguishes self-compulsion from being compelled. It was also shown that without this freedom, or willingness and spontaneity, 
a person cannot possibly be reformed and receive any heavenly proprium; also that though the contrary seems to be the case, there is more freedom in times of temptation than there is outside of 
them. Indeed at such times freedom increases as assaults are made by evils and falsities and it is consolidated by the Lord in order that a heavenly proprium may be given to the person. For that reason 
also the Lord is closer in times of temptation. It was shown as well that the Lord in no way compels anybody. No one who is compelled to think that which is true and to do that which is good is reformed, 
but instead thinks all the more what is false and wills all the more what is evil. This is so with all compulsion, as may also become clear from all the experience and lessons of life, which when 
learned prove two things - first, that human consciences will not allow themselves to be coerced, and second, that we strive after the forbidden. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Furthermore everyone who is not free desires 
to become so, for this is his life. From this it is evident that nothing is in any way pleasing to the Lord that is not done in freedom, that is, spontaneously or willingly. For when anyone worships the 
Lord under circumstances in which he is not free he worships Him with nothing of himself. In his case that which moves the external is the external, that is, it is moved under compulsion - the internal 
being non-existent, or else incompatible, and even contradictory. When a person is being regenerated he compels himself from the freedom the Lord imparts to him, and humbles, and indeed afflicts, 
his rational, so that it may submit itself, and in consequence he receives a heavenly proprium. This proprium is then gradually perfected by the Lord and it becomes more and more free, so that as a result 
it becomes the affection for good and for truth deriving from that good, and possesses delight. And in that affection and delight there is happiness such as the angels experience. This freedom is 
what the Lord Himself is referring to in John. </p>
<blockquote>
The truth makes you free. If the Son makes you free, you are truly free. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%208:32,%2036&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 8:32, 36</a>.
</blockquote>
<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 What this freedom is, is totally unknown to those who 
do not have conscience, for they identify freedom with feelings of being at liberty and without restraint to think and utter what is false, and to will and do what is evil, and not to control and humble, 
still less to afflict, those feelings. Yet this is the complete reverse of freedom, as the Lord again teaches in the same place, </p>
<blockquote>
Everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%208:34&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 8:34</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>People 
acquire this slave-like freedom from the hellish spirits who reside with them and who inject it into them. When the life of those hellish spirits takes possession of them so do the loves and desires 
of those same spirits; for an unclean and utterly disgusting delight blows upon them, and being carried away so to speak in a stream they imagine themselves to be in freedom; but it is hellish freedom. 
The difference between this hellish freedom and heavenly freedom is that the former spells death and drags them down into hell, while the latter, that is, heavenly freedom, promises life and lifts 
them up to heaven. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 That all true internal worship springs from freedom, not from compulsion, and that unless it springs from freedom it is not internal worship, is clear from the Word, from the 
sacrifices - free- will, votive, and peace or eucharistic- which were called offerings and oblations, mentioned in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2015:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 15:3</a> and following verses; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2012:6;%2016:10,%2011;%2023:23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 12:6; 16:10, 11; 23:23</a>; and elsewhere. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
With 
a free-will offering I will sacrifice to You; I will confess Your name, O Jehovah, for it is good. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2054:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 54:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From the thruma,<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> or the collection which the people were to contribute towards 
the Tabernacle and sacred vestments, referred to in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Speak to the children of Israel and let them receive for Me a collection; from every man whose heart makes him willing you shall receive 
My collection. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2025:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 25:2</a>. 
</blockquote>
And elsewhere in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Everyone who is willing in heart shall bring it, Jehovah's collection. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2035:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 35:5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 The humbling of the rational man, or affliction of it 
- as stated, from freedom - was also represented by the affliction souls underwent during festivals, referred to in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
It shall be a statute to you for ever: in the seventh month, on the tenth 
day of the month, you shall afflict your souls. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2016:29&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 16:29</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
On the tenth day of the seventh month is the day of atonement; it shall be a holy convocation for you, and you 
shall afflict your souls. Every soul who does not afflict himself on that very day shall be cut off from his peoples. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2023:27,%2029&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 23:27, 29</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
It is for this reason that unleavened bread in which no fermentation 
has taken place is called the bread of affliction in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2016:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 16:2, 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
Affliction is referred to in David in the following way, </p>
<blockquote>
O Jehovah, who will sojourn in Your tent? Who will dwell on Your 
holy mountain? He who walks blameless and performs righteousness, who swears to the affliction of himself and changes not. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2015:1,%202,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 15:1, 2, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 That 'affliction' is the taming and subduing of evils 
and falsities rising up from the external man into the rational man may become clear from what has been stated. Thus it is not any reduction of oneself to poverty and misery - not a renunciation of 
bodily enjoyments - that is meant by affliction. No taming and subduing of evil can result from doing that; indeed it may give rise to an additional evil, namely the desire to receive merit for such a 
renunciation; and what is more, man's freedom suffers, in which alone, as its ground, the good and truth of faith is able to be sown. Affliction also means temptation; see what has been said already 
in <a href="1846.htm">1846</a>.

`Quia audivit Jehovah ad afflictionem tuam': quod significet cum se submitteret, constat ex illis quae supra n. 1937 dicta sunt, quod `humiliare se et affligere' sit submittere se potestati interni 
hominis, de qua submissione etiam actum est, et ibi ostensum, quod sit se cogere, tum quod in cogere se sit liberum, hoc est, spontaneum et voluntarium, quo se cogere distinguitur a cogi; ostensum quoque 
quod absque hoc libero seu spontaneo aut voluntario, nusquam homo possit reformari et aliquod proprium caeleste accipere; tum etiam, quod in tentationibus plus liberi sit, tametsi contrarium apparet, 
quam extra tentationes, tunc enim liberum fortius fit secundum impugnationes a malis et falsis, et corroboratur a Domino ut proprium caeleste ei donetur, quare etiam in tentationibus Dominus praesentior 
est; ut et quod Dominus nusquam aliquem cogat; qui cogitur ad cogitandum verum et faciendum bonum, non reformatur, sed tunc adhuc magis cogitat falsum et vult malum; omnis coactio hoc secum habet, 
quod etiam constare potest a vitae actis et documentis, per quae cognita sunt haec bina quod conscientiae non patiantur se cogi et quod nitamur in vetitum; [2] quisque etiam a non libero in liberum 
cupit, nam hoc est vitae ejus; inde patet quod nusquam Domino gratum sit aliquid quod non ex libero, hoc est, ex spontaneo {1}aut voluntario; nam cum quis ex non libero colit Dominum, ex nullo suo colit; 
est externum quod se movet, hoc est, quod ex coacto movetur, interno vel nullo, vel repugnante, immo contradicente: cum regeneratur homo, (c)a libero quo donatur a Domino, cogit se, humiliat, immo 
affligit rationale ut se submittat, (m)et inde accipit proprium caeleste, {2}quod proprium dein a Domino per gradus perficitur, et fit magis et magis liberum, sic ut fiat affectio boni et inde veri, 
et ei jucunditas, et in illa et hac felicitas, qualis angelorum(n); hoc liberum est de quo Ipse Dominus ita apud Johannem, Veritas (t)vos liberos {3}facit...si Filius vos liberos {3}facit, vere liberi 
{3}estis, viii 32, 36. [3] Quid liberum hoc, prorsus nesciunt qui conscientiam non habent, liberum enim ponunt in lubitu {4}et licentia cogitandi loquendique falsum ac volendi faciendique malum, 
et haec non cogere, et humiliare, minus affligere, cum tamen prorsus contrarium est, ut quoque Dominus docet apud eundem, Omnis faciens peccatum, servus est peccati, viii 34. Liberum hoc servum accipiunt 
a spiritibus infernalibus qui apud eos, qui infundunt illud, in quorum vita cum sunt, etiam in eorundem amoribus et cupiditatibus sunt, {5}aspirante jucundo imputo et excrementitio, quorum cum quasi 
torrente auferuntur, in libero se putant esse, sed est liberum infernale: differentia inter liberum hoc infernale et inter liberum caeleste, est quod illud sit mortis et detrahat eos ad infernum, 
hoc autem seu liberum caeleste, sit vitae et elevet eos ad caelum.  [4] Quod omnis cultus verus internus non ex coacto sed ex libero fiat, et nisi ex libero non sit cultus internus, constat (c)ex Verbo; 
ex  sacrificiis spontaneis, {6} votivis, pacificis seu eucharisticis, quae munera et oblationes dicta, de quibus Num. xv 3 seq.; Deut. xii (x)6; xvi 10, 11; xxiii 24 [A.V. 23] et alibi: apud Davidem, In 
voluntario sacrificabo Tibi, confitebor nomini Tuo Jehovah, quia bonum, Ps. liv 8 [A.V. 6]; </p>
<p>ex {7}thruma seu collecta quam facerent ad tabernaculum, et ad vestes sanctitatis, de qua apud Mosen, Loquere 
ad filios Israelis, et accipiant mihi collectam a cum omni viro, quem sponte impulit cor ejus accipietis collectam meam, Exod. xxv 2; </p>
<p>et alibi, Omnis spontaneus corde adducet eam, collectam 
Jehovae, Exod. xxxv 5. [5] Humiliatio autem rationalis hominis seu ejus afflictio, ex libero, ut dictum, repraesentata quoque fuit per afflictionem animarum in diebus festis, de qua apud Mosen, Erit 
vobis in statutum aeternitatis, in mense septimo, in decimo mensis, affligetis animas vestras, Lev. xvi 29; </p>
<p>et alibi, In decimo mensis septimi, is dies expiationum ille, convocatio sancta erit 
vobis, et affligetis animas vestras,...omnis anima, quae {8}se non afflixerit in ipso die hoc, {9}exscindetur e populis suis, Lev. xxiii 27, 29; </p>
