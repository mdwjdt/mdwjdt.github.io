<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第204节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>204.</strong>创世记3:4-5 蛇对女人说，你们不一定死，因为神知道，你们吃的日子眼睛就明亮了，你们便如神能知道善恶。<br />“吃的日子眼睛就明亮了”，表示他们若凭感官和知识，亦即凭他自己，来检视信仰，就能明了那不是真的。“便如神能知道善恶”，表示他们若凭自己检视信仰，就能如神一般，可以自己引导自己。</p>

And the snake said to the woman, "You are not going to ‘surely die,' because God knows that on the day when you eat from it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."<br />If they ate from the fruit of the tree their eyes would be opened means that if they scrutinized the tenets of faith from a sensory or factual standpoint — that is, from their own minds — they would see clearly that those tenets were not true.{*1} Their being like God, knowing good and evil means that if they judged good and evil for themselves they would be like God and would be able to lead themselves.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} When Swedenborg says the people described in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_204/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_4-5" target=_top>Genesis 3:4-5</a> would see that the tenets of faith were not true, he means they would see that relying on their own standard of truth would not destroy their wisdom and understanding, contrary to the contents of verses <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_204/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_2-3" target=_top>2-3</a>. The implication, of course, is that they would be wrong. [LHC] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 204</b></p><p><b>204.</b>
Verses 4, 5. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die. For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil. 
Their "eyes being opened by eating of the fruit of the tree" signifies that if they were to examine the things of faith from what is of sense and knowledge [ex sensuali et scientifico], that is, from 
themselves, they would plainly see those things as if erroneous. And that they would be "as God, knowing good and evil" denotes that if they did so from themselves, they would be as God, and could 
guide themselves. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 204</b></p><p><b>204.</b>
Verses 4, 5 And the serpent said to the woman, You will certainly not die. For God knows that on the day in which you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.  
 'If they ate from the fruit of the tree their eyes would be opened' means that if they did probe into matters of faith from sensory perception and factual knowledge, that is, from themselves, they 
would see plainly that it was not so. 'They would be like God, knowing good and evil' means that if they did so from themselves they would be like God and could be their own guides.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 204</b>
</p><b>204.</b>
Vers. 4, 5.  Et dixit serpens ad mulierem, Non moriendo morimini.  Quia novit Deus, quod in die quo editis de eo, et aperiantur oculi vestri, et sitis sicut Deus, scientes bonum et malum. 'Si ederent 
ex fructu arboris quod aperirentur oculi' significat si ex sensuali et scientifico, hoc est, a semet scrutarentur illa quae sunt fidei, quod manifeste viderent res se non ita habere: quod 'essent sicut 
Deus, scientes bonum et malum' significat si ita ex semet, quod forent sicut Deus ac semet ipsos ducere possent. </p>
