<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10711节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10711</strong>.这些灵人喜欢留胡子，显得很老，因为他们总是选一个留胡子的老人来管理他们；他可以说是他们的国王和大祭司。普通百姓也敬拜他，喜欢按照他的生活方式来生活，他们甚至认为他的生活与他们是相通的；但他们当中更聪明的人敬拜神。有这样一个留胡子的老人，他曾是他们的大祭司，就在与我同在的其他人当中。由于他接受了曾为普通百姓的灵人所献上的神性敬拜，并且他引导他们认为他的生活与他们是相通的，所以他受到严厉惩罚；这种惩罚采取的形式是，把他卷在一块布里，转了一圈又一圈，然后他被扔进他自己星球附近的一个地狱里。</p>

They wish to be bearded, and to appear old, for the reason that they always choose and set over them some bearded old man, who is as it were their king and high priest. The common people also worship 
him, and love to live according to his manner of living, insomuch that they believe that his life is communicated to them; but the more intelligent of them worship God. Such a bearded old man, who had 
been their high priest, was one of those who were with me, and as he had accepted Divine worship from the common spirits, and had led them to believe that his life was communicated to them, he was severely 
punished, which was done by wrapping him up in a cloth and whirling him round; and then he was cast into the hell near his own earth. </p>

These spirits like to be bearded and appear aged, because they always choose some aged person with a beard to be in charge over them; he is so to speak their king and high priest. The common people also 
worship him and love to live as he is accustomed to do, and they go so far as to think that his life is communicated to them; but those of them who have greater understanding worship God. One such 
bearded old man who had been their high priest was among all the others present with me. Because he accepted the Divine worship offered him by spirits who had been common people and he led them to think 
that his life was communicated to them, he underwent severe punishment, which took the form of being rolled up in a cloth, whirled round and round, and then hurled into a hell near his own planet.  </p>

</p><b>10711.</b>
Volunt barbati esse et apparere vetusti, ex causa quia semper vetustum quendam barbatum eligunt et sibi praeficiunt, qui quasi rex eorum et pontifex; plebs etiam colit eum, et secundum ejus morem vivendi 
amant vivere, usque ut credant vitam ejus communicari cum illis; sed intelligentiores illorum colunt Deum.  Talis vetustus barbatus qui fuerat pontifex eorum, erat eum reliquis apud me; is quia 
a plebeiis spiritibus acceptabat cultum Divinum, ac inducebat credere quod vita sua communicaretur cum illis, graviter punitus est, quod fiebat per involutionem in panno et contorsionem; ac dein conjectus 
in infernum prope suam tellurem. </p>
