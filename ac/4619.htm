<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4619节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4619.</strong>“归到他本民那里”表它现在属于神性属世层的事物当中。这从“归到他本民那里”的含义清楚可知，就代表而言，“归到他本民那里”是指它不再是所论述的主题（参看<a href="3255.htm">3255</a>，<a href="3276.htm">3276</a>节）；因而在此是指它现在属于神性属世层的事物当中，这一点从刚才所述（<a href="4618.htm">4618</a>节）也可推知。当有人死去时，古人就说“他归到他本民那里”；他们说这句话的时候，在最接近的意义上是指他到了来世，在他自己事物当中。因为就其灵而言，每个人活在肉身期间都与灵人并天使相伴，死后也会来到他们中间（<a href="1277.htm">1277</a>，<a href="2379.htm">2379</a>节）。这就是他所归之“本民”的意思。但就论述教会或主国度的良善与真理的圣言内义而言，“归到某人的本民那里”表示在一致或对应的真理与良善当中。天上的一切社群都处于真理与良善，但由于那里的真理与良善如世上的血亲和姻亲关系那样相互关联，并且千差万别（<a href="685.htm">685</a>，<a href="917.htm">917</a>，<a href="3815.htm">3815</a>，<a href="4121.htm">4121</a>节），所以“他的本民”表示掌管和谐社群的真理，或居于这些真理的社群。“民”表示真理（参看<a href="1259.htm">1259</a>，<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>，<a href="2928.htm">2928</a>，<a href="3295.htm">3295</a>，<a href="3581.htm">3581</a>节）。</p>

And was gathered unto his peoples. That this signifies that it was now among the things which are of the Divine natural, is evident from the signification of "being gathered unto his peoples," as being, 
in regard to representatives, that this one is treated of no longer (see n. 3255, 3276); thus here that it is among the things which are of the Divine natural (as follows from what has been said just 
above, n. 4618). When anyone died the ancients said that "he was gathered to his peoples," and thereby meant in the proximate sense that he was among his own in the other life. For during his bodily 
life every man is as to his spirit in company with spirits and angels, and also comes among the same after death (n. 1277, 2379). This is what was meant by the "peoples" to whom he is gathered. But 
in the internal sense of the Word, where the goods and truths of the church or of the Lord's kingdom are treated of, by "being gathered to one's people" is signified to be among the truths and goods 
which agree or correspond. All the heavenly societies are in truths and goods, but as the truths and goods there are related as by the relationships and connections of earth, with every shade of difference 
(n. 685, 917, 3815, 4121), therefore their "peoples" are the truths in which are the concordant societies, or the societies which are in these truths. (That "peoples" denote truths, see n. 1259, 
1260, 2928, 3295, 3581.) </p>

'And was gathered to his peoples' means that it was now among the things which belonged to the Divine Natural. This is clear from the meaning, when representatives are involved, of 'being gathered to 
his peoples' as its ceasing to be the subject any longer, dealt with in <a href="3255.htm">3255</a>, <a href="3276.htm">3276</a>, and so here that it was now among the things which belonged to the Divine Natural, as also follows from what has been 
stated immediately above in <a href="4618.htm">4618</a>. The ancients used to say, when anyone died, that he was gathered to his peoples; and when they said this they meant in the proximate sense that he was among his own 
in the next life. For every human being while living in the body is in company with spirits and angels as to his spirit, and also comes among the same after death, <a href="1277.htm">1277</a>, <a href="2379.htm">2379</a>. This was what they meant 
by 'the peoples' to whom he was gathered. But in the internal sense of the Word, where the goods and truths of the Church, or the Lord's kingdom, are the subject, 'being gathered to one's peoples' 
means being among truths and goods which accord or correspond. Truths and goods exist with all heavenly communities, but because truths and goods there are interrelated as in blood relationships and relationships 
by marriage on earth, with every variation involved in these, <a href="685.htm">685</a>, <a href="917.htm">917</a>, <a href="3815.htm">3815</a>, <a href="4121.htm">4121</a>, 'his peoples' therefore means the truths which govern concordant communities, that is, communities which 
abide in those truths. As regards 'peoples' meaning truths, see <a href="1259.htm">1259</a>, <a href="1260.htm">1260</a>, <a href="2928.htm">2928</a>, <a href="3295.htm">3295</a>, <a href="3581.htm">3581</a>. </p>

`Et collectus ad populos suos': quod significet quod nunc inter illa quae Divini Naturalis, constat ex significatione `colligi ad populos' quod cum de repraesentativis agitur, sit non amplius de illo, 
de qua n. 3255, 3276, ita hic quod inter illa quae Divini Naturalis sunt, ut quoque sequitur ab illis quae mox supra n. 4618 dicta sunt.  Antiqui cum aliquis moriebatur, dicebant quod `collectus 
sit ad populos,' et tunc in proximo sensu intellexerint quod inter suos in altera vita esset; quisque enim homo in societate est cum spiritibus et angelis quoad spiritum suum, quum vivit in corpore; 
inter eosdem quoque venit post mortem, n. 1277, 2379; hoc intellectum est per `populos ad quos collectus': at in sensu interno Verbi, ubi de bonis et veris Ecclesiae seu regni Domini agitur, per 
`colligi ad populos' significatur inter vera et bona quae concordant seu correspondent; societates {1}caelestes omnes sunt in veris et bonis, sed quia vera et bona ibi se habent sicut consanguinitates 
et affinitates in terra, cum omni differentia, n 685, 917, 3815, 4121, ita `populi sui' {2}sunt vera in quibus societates concordes, seu {3}societates quae in veris illis; quod `populi' sint 
vera, videatur n. 1259, 1260, 2928, 3295, 3581.      @1 i enim$      @2 i seu populi cujusvis$      @3 i quod idem ubi$ </p>
