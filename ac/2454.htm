<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2454节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2454.</strong>“他的妻子在他后面回头一看”表真理转离良善，关注教义。这从“在他后面回头一看”和“妻子”的含义清楚可知。前面已说明（<a href="2417.htm">2417</a>节），“在他后面回头一看”是指关注属于真理的教义，而非关注属于良善的照着教义的生活；因为在后之物被说成是在“他后面”；而在先之物则被说成是在“他前面”。前面频繁说明，真理在后，良善在先；真理属于良善，因为良善是真理的本质和生命；故“在他后面回头一看”是指关注属于教义的真理，而非关注属于照着教义的生活的良善。这些要点就是所表示的，这从主的话很清楚地看出来，也就是祂在路加福音中论及教会末期或世代终结的地方：<br />当那日，人在房上，器具在屋里，不要下来拿；人在田里，也不要在他后面回头：想想罗得的妻子。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路17.31.htm">17:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路17.32.htm">32</a>）<br />若没有内义，因而若不知道“在房上”、“器具在屋里”、“下来拿”、“在田里”，以及最后“也不要在他后面回头”分别表示什么，主的这些话根本不容易理解。根据内义，“在房上”是指在良善中；因为“房”表良善（参看<a href="710.htm">710</a>，<a href="2238.htm">2238</a>，<a href="2234.htm">2234</a>节）。“器具在屋里”表属于良善的真理；因为真理是良善的器皿（参看<a href="1496.htm">1496</a>，<a href="1832.htm">1832</a>，<a href="1900.htm">1900</a>，<a href="2063.htm">2063</a>，<a href="2269.htm">2269</a>节）。“下来拿”表将人的自我从良善转向真理，如我们所看到的；因为良善是在先的，故也是较高的；而真理是在后的，故是较低的。“田”表教会，并因它所接纳的种子而被如此称呼，所以那些具有教义所教导的良善之人就是“田”，这一点从圣言中的很多经文明显看出来。这一切表明“在他后面回头一看”表示什么，也就是说，将人的自我从良善转离，并关注教义；因此，由于这些事由罗得的妻子来表示，故经上补充说“想想罗得的妻子”。经上并未说她“在她自己后面回头一看”，而是说“在他后面回头一看”，是因为“罗得”表良善（参看<a href="2324.htm">2324</a>，<a href="2351.htm">2351</a>，<a href="2370.htm">2370</a>，<a href="2399.htm">2399</a>节）。正因如此，当罗得被告知该怎么做（19:17节）时，经上说“不可回头看”。<br />在路加福音中，经上为何说“不要在他后面回头”，而没有提及“在他后面的事物”。其原因在于，属天之人甚至不愿提及任何具有教义性质的事物（参看<a href="202.htm">202</a>，<a href="337.htm">337</a>节）。这就为何这类事物没有在路加福音中被提及，经上只是说“在他后面”的原因。<br />同样这些事在马太福音中是这样来描述的：<br />你们看见先知但以理所说的那行毁坏可憎的，那时，在犹太的，应当逃到山上；在房上的，不要下来拿家里的东西；在田里的，也不要回去取衣裳。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.15.htm">24:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.17.htm">17</a>）<br />此处“那行毁坏可憎的”表没有爱与仁之时教会的状态，因为当爱与仁荒凉后，可憎的事就居多。“犹太”表教会，事实上表属天教会，这一点从整个旧约的历史和预言章节明显看出来。他们所逃往的“山”表对主之爱，随之表对邻之仁（参看<a href="795.htm">795</a>，<a href="1430.htm">1430</a>，<a href="1691.htm">1691</a>节）。“在房上的”表爱之善，这一点刚才已经说了。“下来拿家里的东西”表将人的自我从良善转向真理，这一点刚才也已经说了。“在田里的”表那些在属灵教会中的人，这一点从圣言中“田”的含义明显可知。“也不要回去取衣裳”表不要将自己从良善转向属于教义的真理，这是因为“衣裳”表真理，真理象衣服那样包裹良善（参看<a href="1073.htm">1073</a>节）。谁都能看出，主在那一节所说关于世代终结的所有那些事表示完全不同的事物，并包含奥秘。如在犹太的，应当逃到山上；在房上的，不要下来拿家里的东西；在田里的，也不要回去取衣裳。类似的事还有，17节经上说罗得不可回头看，此处经上说他的妻子“在他后面回头一看”，就变成了一根盐柱。另外，这一点从“妻子”和“罗得”的含义明显可知：“妻子”是指真理（参看<a href="915.htm">915</a>，<a href="1468.htm">1468</a>节）；“罗得”是指良善（参看<a href="2324.htm">2324</a>，<a href="2351.htm">2351</a>，<a href="2370.htm">2370</a>，<a href="2399.htm">2399</a>节）；因此，经上说“在他后面”。<br />当教会成员放在心上的不再是他过什么样的生活，而是他拥有什么样的教义时，就说真理转离良善，并关注教义。然而，使得人成为教会成员的，正是照着教义的生活，而非脱离生活的教义。若教义脱离生活，那么由于构成生活的良善荒凉了，故构成教义的真理也荒凉了，即变成一根盐柱。这是唯独关注教义，不关注生活之人也能知道的事，只要想一想，他是否（尽管教义教导了这类事）真的相信复活，天堂，地狱，甚至主，以及教义所教导的其它事。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2454</b></p><p><b>2454.</b>
His wife looked back behind him. That this signifies that truth turned itself away from good, and looked to doctrinal things, is evident from the signification of "looking back behind him," and from 
the signification of a "wife." It has been already said (n. 2417) that to "look back behind him" is to look to doctrinal things, which are of truth, and not to a life according to doctrinal things, which 
is of good; for that is said to be "behind" him, which is posterior; and that is said to be "before" him, which is prior. It has been frequently shown that truth is posterior, and good prior; for 
truth is of good, because good is the essence and life of truth; and therefore to "look back behind him" is to look to truth, which is of doctrine, and not to good, which is of life according to doctrine. 
That this is the signification is very evident from the Lord's words (where also He is speaking of the last time of the church, or of the consummation of the age) in Luke: </p>
<p>     In that day he that 
shall be upon the house, and his vessels in the house, let him not go down to take them away; and let him that is in the field likewise not turn back behind him: Remember Lot's wife (Luke 17:31-32). [2] 
These words of the Lord are not at all intelligible without the internal sense, thus unless it is known what is signified by being upon the house, what by the vessels in the house, what by going 
down to take them away, and what by the field, and lastly what by turning back behind him. According to the internal sense, to be "upon the house" is to be in good (that a "house" denotes good may be 
seen above, n. 710, 2238, 2234). The "vessels" in a house denote the truths which are of good (that truths are the vessels of good, may be seen above, n. 1496, 1832, 1900, 2063, 2269). To "go down to 
take them away" denotes to turn one's self away from good to truth, as we can see; for as good is prior it is also higher; and as truth is posterior it is lower. That a "field" denotes the church, being 
so called from the seed which it receives into it, consequently that those are "fields" who are in the good of doctrine, is evident from many passages in the Word. This shows what is signified by 
"turning back behind him," namely, to turn one's self away from good, and to look to doctrinal things; wherefore, because these things are signified by Lot's wife, it is added, "Remember Lot's wife." 
It is not said that she "looked back behind herself," but "behind him;" because "Lot" signifies good (see n. 2324, 2351, 2370, 2399). Hence it is that when Lot was told what to do (verse 17), it was 
said, "Look not back behind thee." [3] The reason why it is said in Luke, "Let him not turn back behind him," and not "to the things that are behind him," is that the celestial are not willing even to 
mention anything of a doctrinal nature (see n. 202, 337); which is the reason why nothing specific is mentioned, but it is merely said "behind him." These same things are thus described in Matthew: </p>
<p> 
    When ye shall see the abomination of desolation, foretold by Daniel the prophet, then let them that are in Judea flee into the mountains; let him that is upon the house not go down to take anything 
out of his house; and let him that is in the field not return back to take his garments (Matt. 24:15-17). [4] The "abomination of desolation" denotes the state of the church when there is no love 
and no charity, for when these are desolated, abominable things predominate. That "Judea" denotes the church, and indeed the celestial church, is evident from the Word of the Old Testament throughout, 
both the historic and the prophetic. That the "mountains" into which they shall flee, denote love to the Lord and the consequent charity toward the neighbor, may be seen above (n. 795, 1430, 1691). 
That "he who is upon the house," denotes the good of love, has just been stated. That to "go down to take anything out of his house," denotes to turn one's self away from good to truth, has also just 
been stated. That "they who are in the field" denote those who are in the spiritual church, is evident from the signification in the Word of a "field." That "let him not return back to take his garments," 
denotes that he should not turn himself away from good to the truth that is of doctrine, is because "garments" signify truths, for truths act as garments in clothing good (see n. 1073). Everyone 
can see that very different things are meant and that arcana are involved by all that the Lord there said concerning the consummation of the age, as that they who were in Judea should flee into the mountains, 
that they who were upon the house should not go down to take anything out of the house, and that they who were in the field should not return back to take their garments; and in like manner by 
its being said that Lot should not look back behind himself (verse 17), and here that his wife did look back behind him. This is further evident from the signification of a "wife," as being truth (see 
n. 915, 1468); and from the signification of "Lot," as being good (see n. 2324, 2351, 2370, 2399); hence it is said "behind him." [5] Truth is said to turn itself away from good, and to look to doctrinal 
things, when the man of the church no longer has at heart what kind of a life he lives, but what kind of a doctrine he possesses; when yet it is a life according to doctrine that makes a man of 
the church, but not doctrine separate from life; for when doctrine is separated from life, then because good, which is of the life, is laid waste, truth, which is of doctrine, is also laid waste, that 
is, becomes a pillar of salt; which everyone may know who looks only to doctrine and not to life, when he considers whether, although doctrine teaches them, he believes in the resurrection, in heaven, 
in hell, even in the Lord, and in the rest of the things that are of doctrine. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2454</b></p><p><b>2454.</b>
That 'his wife looked back behind him' means that truth turned away from good and looked towards matters of doctrine is clear from the meaning of 'looking back behind him' and from the meaning of 'a 
wife'. Looking back behind him means looking towards matters of doctrine, which have a relationship with truth, and not towards life in accordance with them, which has a relationship with good, as stated 
above in <a href="2417.htm">2417</a>. That which is secondary is referred to as 'behind him' and that which is primary as 'before him'. The fact that truth is secondary and good primary has been shown quite often. For truth 
belongs to good, since the essence and life of truth is good. 'Looking behind him' therefore means looking towards truth which constitutes doctrinal teaching, and not towards good which constitutes 
life in accordance with doctrinal teaching. That these points are what is meant becomes quite clear from the Lord's words, where also, referring to the final period of the Church or close of the age, 
He says in Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
On that day, whoever will be on the housetop with his vessels in the house, let him not come down to take them away; and whoever is in the field, let him likewise not turn back 
to behind him. Remember Lot's wife. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2017:-31,%2032&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 17:-31, 32</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 These words of the Lord are by no means intelligible without the internal sense, and so are unintelligible unless one knows what is meant by 
'being on the housetop', by 'vessels in the house', by 'coming down to take them away', by 'the field', and lastly by 'turning back to behind him'. According to the internal sense 'being on the housetop' 
means resting on good; for 'a house' means good, see <a href="710.htm">710</a>, <a href="2231.htm">2231</a>, <a href="2233.htm">2233</a>. 'Vessels in the house' means truths which belong to good; for truths are the vessels for good, see <a href="1496.htm">1496</a>, <a href="1832.htm">1832</a>, <a href="1900.htm">1900</a>, <a href="2063.htm">2063</a>, <a href="2269.htm">2269</a>. 
'Going down to take them away' means, as is evident, turning away from good towards truth, for since good is primary it is also higher, while truth, being secondary, is also lower. That 'the field' 
is the Church, so called from the seed which it receives, and consequently that those people are 'fields' in whom there is the good taught by doctrine, is clear from many places in the Word. These considerations 
show what 'turning back to behind him' means, namely turning away from good and looking towards matters of doctrine. And it is because these things are meant by the expression 'Lot's wife', 
that 'remember Lot's wife' is added. The reason it is not said that she looked 'behind herself' but 'behind him' is that 'Lot' means good, see <a href="2324.htm">2324</a>, <a href="2351.htm">2351</a>, <a href="2371.htm">2371</a>, <a href="2399.htm">2399</a>. This explains why, when Lot was 
told what to do, verse 17, the words used were, 'Do not look back behind you'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The reason why in Luke it is said 'let him not turn back to behind him' and not 'to the things behind him' is that 
celestial people are unwilling even to mention anything that is a matter of doctrine, see <a href="202.htm">202</a>, <a href="337.htm">337</a>. This is why no such thing is mentioned in Luke, only the words 'to behind him'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 These same 
matters are described in Matthew as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
When you see the abomination of desolation, foretold by the prophet Daniel, then let those who are in Judea flee into the mountains. Let him who is on 
the housetop not go down to take anything away out of his house; and let him who is in the field not return back to take his clothes. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2024:%2015-17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 24: 15-17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the abomination of desolation' is the state 
of the Church when there is no love and no charity. When these have been destroyed abominable things predominate. 'Judea' means the Church, and in particular the celestial Church, as is evident from 
both the historical and prophetical sections throughout the Old Testament Word, while 'the mountains into which they were to flee' means love to the Lord and consequent charity towards the neighbour, 
see <a href="795.htm">795</a>, <a href="1430.htm">1430</a>, <a href="1691.htm">1691</a>. 'He who is on the housetop' means good flowing from love, as stated just above. 'Going down to take anything away out of his house' means turning away from good towards truth, 
as has also been stated above, while 'he who is in the field' means members of the spiritual Church, as is evident from the meaning of 'field' in the Word. 'Let him not return back to take his clothes' 
means not turning away from good towards truth that constitutes doctrinal teaching - 'clothes' meaning truths, for truths clothe good like garments, see <a href="1073.htm">1073</a>. Anyone may see that all those things which 
the Lord has said in that section about the close of the age mean things altogether different and embody arcana, such as that those in Judea were to flee into the mountains, that the one on the housetop 
was not to go down and bring anything out of the house, and that the one in the field was not to return back to take his clothes. Similar to this is the statement in verse 17 that Lot was not 
to look back behind him, and that made here that his wife did look back behind him and became a pillar of salt. In addition this matter is clear from the meaning of 'a wife' as truth, dealt with in <a href="915.htm">915</a>, <a href="1468.htm">1468</a>, and from the meaning of 'Lot' as good, dealt with in <a href="2324.htm">2324</a>, <a href="2351.htm">2351</a>, <a href="2371.htm">2371</a>, <a href="2399.htm">2399</a>; hence the words 'after him'.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Truth is said to turn away from good and look towards matters of doctrine when 
the member of the Church no longer takes to heart what kind of life he leads, only what kind of doctrine he possesses. Yet it is life according to doctrine, not doctrine separate from life, that makes 
anyone a member of the Church; for when doctrine is separated from life, then because good, in which life consists, has been vastated, truth as well, in which doctrine consists, is vastated, that is, 
it becomes 'a pillar of salt'. This is something anyone who looks to doctrine alone and not to life may know, by considering whether, even though doctrine teaches such things, he in fact believes in 
the resurrection, heaven, hell, and indeed the Lord, and so in everything else which doctrine teaches. </p>

Quod `respexit uxor ejus post eum' significet quod verum averterit se a bono et spectaverit ad doctrinalia, constat a significatione `respicere post eum,' et a significatione `uxoris'; respicere post 
eum quod sit ad doctrinalia, quae sunt veri, non autem ad vitam secundum doctrinalia, quae est boni, supra n. 2417 dictum est; id enim dicitur `post eum' quod posterius (o)est, et id ante eum quod prius; 
quod verum sit posterius et bonum prius, saepius ostensum est; verum enim est boni, nam essentia et vita veri est bonum; quare `respicere post eum' est ad verum quod est doctrinalis, non autem ad

verba nusquam intelligibilia sunt absque sensu interno, ita nisi sciatur quid significant `esse super domo,' quid `vasa in domo,' quid `descendere ad tollendum ea,' et quid `ager,' et demum quid `reverti

videatur n. 1496, 1832, 1900, 2063, 2269; `descendere ad tollendum ea' est se avertere a bono ad verum, quod patet, bonum enim sicut est prius etiam est superius, et verum sicut est posterius etiam 
est inferius; quod `ager' sit Ecclesia, ita dicta a semine quod recipit, proinde quod illi sint `agri' qui in bono doctrinae sunt, ex multis in Verbo locis constat; inde patet quid significat `reverti

quia `Lot' significat bonum, videatur n. 2324, 2351, 2371, 2399, inde est cum dicebatur ad Lotum, vers. 17 quod dictum `ne respicias post te'; [3] (m)quod apud Lucam dicatur `ne revertatur ad post cum,' 
non `ad illa quae post eum,' est quia caeleste ne quidem nominare volunt aliquid quod est doctrinalis, videatur n. 202, 337, quae causa est quod nec nominatum, sed dictum `ad post eum.'  [4] Eadem 
haec ita describuntur apud Matthaeum, 	Cum videritis abominationem desolationis, praedictam a Daniele propheta;... tunc qui in Judaea sunt, fugiant in monte: qui super domo est, ne descendat ad tollendum 
quid e domo sua; et qui in agro, ne revertatur retro ad tollendum vestimenta sua, xxiv 15-17; </p>
<p>ubi `abominatio desolationis' est status Ecclesiae cum nullus amor et nulla charitas, quibus desolatis 
regnant abominabilia; quod `Judaea' sit Ecclesia, et quidem caelestis, a Verbo tam historico quam prophetico Veteris Testamenti ubivis patet; quod `montes' in {1} quos fugerent, sint amor in Dominum 
et inde charitas erga proximum, videatur n. 795, 1430, 1691; `qui super domo' quod sit bonum amoris, mox supra dictum; `descendere ad tollendum quid e domo sua' quod sit se avertere a bono ad verum,

quod doctrinalis; quod `vestimenta' significent vera, quia vera induunt bonum ut {2} vestes, videatur n. 1073 quisque videre potest quod omnia illa quae Dominus de consummatione saeculi ibi locutus 
est, significent prorsus alia, ac involvant arcana, ut quod `qui in Judaea fugerent montes,' quod `qui super domo non descenderet ad tollendum quid domo,' et quod `qui in agro non reverteretur retro 
ad tollendum vestimenta sua'; similiter quod `Lot non respiceret post se,' vers. 17, et hic quod `uxor ejus respexerit post eum {3}.' Porro constat hoc significatione `uxoris' quod sit verum, de qua n. 
915, 1468; et a significatione `Loti' quod sit bonum, de qua n. 2324, 2351, 2371, 2399; inde dicitur `post eum.'  [5] Verum dicitur avertere se a bono et spectare doctrinalia, cum non amplius cordi 
est quali vita sit {4} homo Ecclesiae, sed quali doctrina, cum tamen vita secundum doctrinam faciat homini Ecclesiae, non autem doctrina separata a vita; cum enim doctrina separatur a vita, tunc quia
