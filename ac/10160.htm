<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10160节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10160</strong>.当被问及在他们的星球上，他们是否生活在族长或国王的统治之下时，他们回答说，他们不知道这种统治是什么，而是自我支配，分成宗族、家族和家庭。当被进一步问及他们这样是否安全时，他们说，他们很安全，因为家族之间从来不互相嫉妒，根本不想从对方那里夺走什么。他们对这样的问题感到恼火，好像这些问题指控他们存有敌意，需要采取保护措施对付强盗。他们说，除了衣食，因而知足、平安地居住，只受自己支配外，人还需要什么呢？<br />他们从来自我们地球的上古之人那里发觉，这些人在他们那个时代也是如此生活的，那时他们不知道什么叫出于爱自己向他人发号施令，什么叫出于爱世界累积超出生活所需的财富。他们还发觉，那时这些人既享有内在的平安，同时也享有外在的平安，天堂由此而与人类同住。所以这些时代被古代作家称为黄金时代，并以这些话来描述：人们出于写在他们心上的律法而行公义和公平。<br />在圣言中，“无门无闩，安然独居”（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结38.11.htm">38:11</a>）就描述了这些时代的生活状态。事实上，他们住在帐棚里，所以作为这个时代的纪念，帐棚被搭建起来当作神的殿，后来又设立住棚节或帐棚节，他们在这个节日要尽情欢乐。由于过这种生活的人没有为了自己而实施统治，为了世界而赚得世界的疯狂之爱，所以天堂降临在他们中间，许多人看见人形的主。</p>

The question was asked, whether in their earth they live under the commands of chiefs or kings; to which they replied that they do not know what commands are, and that they live under themselves, distinguished 
into nations, families, and households. It was further asked whether in this way they are safe. They said that they are safe, because one family never envies another, nor wishes to take away 
anything from it. They were indignant at being asked such questions; as though it involved a charge of hostility, and of some need of protection against robbers. "What more do men need," said they, 
"than to have food and clothing, and thus to dwell content and quiet under themselves?" [2] It was perceived from the most ancient people who were from our earth that they had so lived in their time, 
and that they then knew not what it was to exercise command over others from the love of self, and from the love of the world to heap up wealth beyond what is necessary; and that they then had inward 
peace, and at the same time outward peace, and from this heaven among men. Those times were therefore called by ancient writers the Golden Age, and they were described by saying that the people did what 
was just and right from the law written on their hearts. [3] The state of life of those times is described in the Word by "dwelling under themselves safely and alone without gates and bars" (Ezek. 
38:11). And as their habitations were tents, therefore in memory of this a tent was erected which was for a house of God, and afterward the feast of tents was instituted, in which they were glad from 
the heart. And as they who lived in this way were free from the insane love of exercising command for the sake of themselves, and of gaining the world for the sake of the world, therefore heaven then 
let itself down to them, and the Lord was seen by many in a human form. </p>

When asked whether on their planet they live subject to the rule of governors or of kings they replied that they do not know what such rule is and that they live subject only to themselves, divided into 
clans, families, and households. When asked further whether they are therefore free from anxiety they said that they are free from it since one family is not at all envious of another and has no wish 
at all to take anything away from it. They were annoyed by such questions, as though these charged them with the existence of enmity and the existence of some safeguard against robbers. What more, 
they declared, do people need to have apart from food and clothing, in order that they may dwell contented and at peace, subject only to themselves?  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It was recognized, they said, from the most 
ancient people who were from our own planet that these people had in their times led a similar kind of life and that then they had not known what it was to be stirred by self-love to rule over others 
or to be moved by love of the world to accumulate possessions in excess of the necessities of life. They perceived also that those people then enjoyed inward and at the same time outward peace, so that 
heaven dwelt with mankind. Those times were therefore referred to by the writers of old as the golden age, and were described as ones in which people were led to do what was right and fair by the 
law written on their hearts. </p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The circumstances in which they lived in those times are described in the Word as ones in which they dwelt by themselves, in security, subject only to themselves, without 
doors or bars. Indeed they lived in tents, and therefore as a reminder of this a tent was made to serve as the house of God, and afterwards the feast of tents or tabernacles was established, when 
they were to rejoice heartily. And since those who led this kind of life were devoid of the insane love of ruling for selfish reasons and of gaining the world for worldly reasons, heaven came down among 
them, and the Lord was seen in the human form by many.  </p>

</p><b>10160.</b>
Quaerebatur num in tellure sua vivant sub imperiis principum aut regum; ad haec respondebant quod nesciant quid imperia et quod vivant sub se, distincti in gentes, familias, et domos; porro quaerebatur 
num sic securi; dicebant quod securi, quoniam una familia alteri nihil invidet et nihil derogare vult; indignati quod talia quaererentur sicut insimulatum esset hostilitatis, et alicujus tutelae contra 
praedones quid magis opus est, ajebant, quam habere victum et amictum, et sic contenti et quieti sub se habitare? 	[2] Perceptum est ab antiquissimis qui fuerunt ex nostro tellure, quod similiter 
suo tempore vixissent et quod tunc nescivissent quid esset imperare aliis ex amore sui, et coacervare opes ultra necessitates ex amore mundi; et quod tunc illis pax interna et simul externa, et inde 
caelum apud hominem. Ea tempora ideo a vetustis scriptoribus dicta fuerunt saecula aurea, et descripta per quod justum et aequum ex lege inscripta cordibus egerint.  Status vitae illorum temporum describitur 
in Verbo per habitare sub se secure et solitarie, absque valvis et vectibus; et quia habitacula eorum fuerunt tentoria, ideo in memoriam exstructum fuit tentorium, quod pro domo Dei fuit, et 
dein institutum est festum tentoriorum, in quo laetarentur ex corde; et quoniam illi qui ita vixerunt erant absque vesano amore imperandi propter se et lucrandi mundum propter mundum, ideo caelum tunc 
demisit se ad illos, et Dominus in forma humana multis visus fuit. </p>
