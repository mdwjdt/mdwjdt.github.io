<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2388节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2388.</strong>“你这里还有什么人吗？无论是女婿，是儿女和这城中一切属你的人，你都要将他们从这地方带出去”表凡具有仁之善的人及其所属一切，以及那些具有信之真理的人只要从恶中退出，都会得救。这从下文所论述的“女婿”、“儿子”、“女儿”、“城”和“地方”的含义清楚可知。<br />至于那些受信之真理主导的人只要从恶中退出，就会得救，情况是这样：信之真理是接受良善的容器本身（<a href="1900.htm">1900</a>，<a href="2063.htm">2063</a>，<a href="2261.htm">2261</a>，<a href="2269.htm">2269</a>节）；只要从恶中退出，它们就会接受良善；因为良善不断从主流入，而阻碍良善在人所拥有的、存在于其记忆或知识中的真理里面被接受的，正是生活的邪恶。所以，人越从恶中退出，良善就越进入，并将自己安插在他所具有的真理中；然后，他所具有的信之真理就变成了信之良善。人的确能认识真理，还能在某些世俗因素的促使下公开承认它，甚至被说服相信这是真理；然而，只要他过着邪恶的生活，这种真理仍不是活的。因为这种人就象只长叶、不结果的树；他的真理就像没有热的光，诸如冬天里什么也不长的冬光。但当它里面有了热时，这光就像春天里万物生长的春光。在圣言中，真理好比光，并被称作光；而热好比爱，也被称作属灵之热。在来世，真理也通过光来显明自身，良善通过热来显明自身；但没有良善的真理则通过冷光来显明自身，有良善的真理则通过类似于春光的光来显明自身。这表明没有仁之善的信之真是何性质。正因如此，表示这类真理的女婿和儿子没有得救，得救的只有罗得和他的女儿。<br />由于此处说到，那些具有信之真理的人只要从恶中退出，就会得救，所以要知道，他们就是那些宣称信，但不思想仁爱的人，因为他们就是这样被教导的。他们不知道何为仁爱，以为仁爱仅仅是将自己的东西给予他人，并怜悯每个人。他们也不知道何为要给予仁爱的邻舍，以为几乎人人都是邻舍，不加分别。尽管如此，这些人仍过着对邻仁爱的生活，因为他们具有良善的生命。这些人不会由于与其他人一同宣称信而受到伤害，因为他们的信里面有仁爱；这仁爱意味着生命的一切良善，无论总体还是细节。至于何为仁爱，何为邻舍，蒙主怜悯，这将在下文予以讨论。 </p>

Hast thou yet anyone here? Son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whomsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of the place. That this signifies that all who are in the good of charity, 
and that all things belonging thereto, would be saved, and also those who are in the truth of faith, provided they would recede from evil, is evident from the signification of "sons-in-law," of "sons," 
of "daughters," of "city," and of "place," concerning which in what follows. [2] As regards those being saved who are in the truth of faith, provided they recede from evil, the case is this. The truths 
of faith are the very receiving vessels of good (n. 1900, 2063, 2261, 2269); and they receive good insofar as the man recedes from evil; for good continually flows in from the Lord, and it is the 
evil of life that hinders its being received in the truths which are with man in his memory or knowledge. Therefore insofar as a man recedes from evil, so far good enters and applies itself to his truths; 
and then the truth of faith with him becomes the good of faith. A man may indeed know truth, may also confess it under the incitement of some worldly cause, may even be persuaded that it is true; 
and yet this truth does not live so long as he is in a life of evil. For such a man is like a tree on which there are leaves, but no fruit; and His truth is like light in which there is no heat, such 
as there is in the time of winter when nothing grows. But when there is heat in it, the light then becomes such as there is in the time of spring, when all things grow. In the Word truth is compared 
to light and is called "light," but heat is compared to love, and is also called spiritual heat. In the other life also truth manifests itself by light, and good by heat; but truth without good by cold 
light, and truth with good by light similar to that of spring. This shows what the truth of faith is without the good of charity. Hence it is that the sons-in-law and the sons, by whom such truths 
are signified, were not saved; but only Lot with His daughters.  [3] As it is here said that those also who are in the truth of faith are saved, provided they recede from evil, be it known that these 
are they who profess faith and think nothing about charity for the reason that they have been so instructed, and do not know what charity is (supposing that it consists merely in the giving of our own 
to others, and in pitying everybody), and who also do not know what the neighbor is toward whom charity is to be exercised (for they suppose that the neighbor is almost everybody, without distinction), 
and yet who live in the life of charity toward the neighbor, because in the life of good. It does these persons no harm to profess faith along with all the rest, for in their faith there is charity, 
since this means all the good of life in general and in particular. What therefore charity is, and what the neighbor, will of the Lord's Divine mercy be told in what follows. </p>

'Whom have you here still? Son-in-law, and your sons, and your daughters, and everyone you have in the city - bring [them] out of the place' means that all with whom the good of charity exists, and everything 
belonging to that good, were to be saved; also those governed by the truth of faith, provided they drew back from evil. This is clear from the meaning of 'sons-in-law', 'sons', 'daughters', 
'city', and 'place', which are dealt with in the paragraphs following this. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards the salvation of those governed by the truth of faith provided they drew back from evil, the position is that 
truths of faith are the vessels themselves for receiving good, <a href="1900.htm">1900</a>, <a href="2063.htm">2063</a>, <a href="2261.htm">2261</a>, <a href="2269.htm">2269</a>, and they receive good insofar as the individual draws back from evil. For good is flowing in constantly from 
the Lord, but it is the evil belonging to the life within that prevents the reception of that good by the truths present in a person's memory or knowledge. Consequently insofar as a person draws back 
from evil good enters in and inserts itself within the truths he has. When this happens the truth of faith residing with him becomes the good of faith. A person can indeed know the truth, even profess 
it because some worldly reason prompts him to do so; in fact he can even be persuaded that it is the truth. But this truth still does not live so long as he leads a life of evil. Such a person is like 
a tree that has leaves on it but no fruit; and that truth is like light in which there is no warmth, like that in winter-time when nothing grows. When however there is warmth within it, it becomes like 
light in spring-time when everything is growing. In the Word truth is compared to and actually called the light, while love is compared to warmth and also called spiritual warmth. In the next life 
moreover truth manifests itself by means of light while good does so by means of warmth. But truth devoid of good manifests itself as cold light, while truth accompanied by good does so as spring-like 
light. This shows what the truth of faith is when devoid of the good of charity. Here too is the reason why his sons-in-law and his sons, who meant such truths, were not saved, only Lot together with 
his daughters. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Since it is stated here that they also are saved who are governed by the truth of faith provided they draw back from evil, it should be recognized that these people are such - 
on account of their having been so taught- as profess faith but think nothing of charity. They do not know what charity is, imagining that it is purely a matter of giving away what is one's own to others 
and of taking pity on everyone. Nor do they know what the neighbour is, towards whom charity has to be exercised; they imagine that almost everybody without discrimination is the neighbour. Nevertheless 
these same people do lead a life of charity towards the neighbour since the life of good is present in them. They come to no harm because they profess faith along with the rest, since their faith 
has charity within it; for by charity is meant all goodness of life in general and in particular. What charity is therefore, and what the neighbour, will in Lord's Divine mercy be discussed later on. </p>

`Adhuc quis tibi hic? generum, et filios tuos, et filias tuas, et omnem qui tibi in urbe, educ e loco': quod significet quod omnes qui in bono charitatis, et omnia quae ejus, salvarentur, etiam qui 
in vero fidei, si recederent a malo, constat ex significatione `generorum, filiorum, filiarum, urbis, et loci,' de qua sequitur.  [2] Quod illi qui in vero fidei sunt, si recedant a malo, salventur, ita 
se habet: vera fidei sunt ipsa vasa recipientia boni, n. 1900, 2063, 2261, 2269, et recipiunt bonum quantam homo recedit a malo; bonam enim continue influit a Domino, sed est malum vitae quod impedit 
quin {1} recipiatur in veris quae apud hominem in ejus memoria vel scientia; inde quantum recedit homo a malo, tantum intrat bonum et inapplicat se ejus veris; tunc veram fidei apud eum fit bonum fidei: 
homo quidem scire verum potest, etiam confiteri, incitante quadam causa mundana, immo etiam persuaderi quod sit verum, sed usque hoc verum non vivit quamdiu est in vita mali; est enim talis homo 
sicut arbor in qua folia, sed nihil fructus; et est verum illud sicut lux in qua nullus calor, qualis est tempore hiemis quando nihil crescit; at cum calor inest, tunc fit lux `qualis tempore veris quando 
omnia crescunt; verum in Verbo comparatur luci et vocatur lux, amor autem comparatur calori {2}, et vocatur quoque calor spiritualis; (m)in altera vita etiam verum se manifestat per lucem, bonum 
autem per calorem; (o)at verum absque bono per lucem frigidam, sed {3} cum bono per lucem vernali similem.(n)  Inde patet quid verum fidei absque bono charitatis; exinde {4} est quod generi e filii, 
per quos significata sunt talia vera, non salvati sint, sed solum Lot cum filiabus.  [3] (m)Quia hic dicitur quod etiam qui in vero fidei si a malo recedant, salventur, sciendum quod sint illi qui profitentur 
fidem, ac nihil cogitant de charitate, ex causa quod sic instructi, e quod non sciant quid charitas, putantes quod solum sit dare aliis quod suum est, et misereri cujusvis, tum quod non sciant 
quid proximus, in erga quem charitas, putantes quod sint in genere omnes, fere absque discrimine, et usque iidem in vita charitatis erga proximum vivunt, quia in vita boni; iis nihil nocet quod fidem 
cum ceteris profiteantur nam eorum fidei inest charitas, haec enim significat omne bonum vitae in genere et in specie; quid itaque charitas, et quid proximus, in sequentibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, 
dicetur.(n) 	@1 i bonum.$ 	@2 i illa.$ 	@3 AI have calor... amori.$ 	@4 at.$ 	@5 inde.$ </p>
