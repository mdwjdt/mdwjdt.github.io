<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7206节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7206.</strong>“藉着大判罚”表照着源于主的神性人身的秩序律法。这从“判罚”的含义清楚可知，“判罚”是指真理（参看<a href="2235.htm">2235</a>，<a href="6397.htm">6397</a>节），在论及主的至高意义上是指神性真理；这些真理无非是源于主的神性人身的秩序律法，因为祂是一切秩序，因而一切秩序律法的来源。这些律法形成整个天堂，因而宇宙的架构。秩序的律法，或从主发出的真理形成整个天堂和宇宙的架构，就是约翰福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.3.htm">3</a>）中“万物都是藉着圣言或道造的”所说的；因为“圣言”或“道”是指从主的神性人身的神性良善发出的神性真理；这意味着在灵界和自然界，一切事物都与真理有关，凡进行反思的人都能看出这一点。<br />就最近似的意义而言，“大判罚”在此表示那些通过引入虚假进行侵扰的人，就是“埃及人”和“法老”所表示的人，将要受审判所依据的真理；也表示那些将从侵扰中被释放的人，就是“以色列人”所表示的人，将要受审判所依据的真理。沉浸于邪恶所生的虚假之人通过这些审判被诅咒，而那些处于良善所生的真理之人通过这些审判被拯救。并不是说从主发出的真理诅咒任何人，因为从主发出的一切真理都源于祂的神性良善，因而无非是怜悯。相反，是人不接受主的怜悯，从而使自己受到诅咒；因为那时他们陷入邪恶，邪恶正在进行诅咒。如果有人以为他得救凭的是与他同在的信之真理，而非怜悯，那么从主发出的真理不会拯救他。因为人充满邪恶，任由自己就在地狱；但凭主的怜悯，他就会躲避邪恶，被保守在良善中，这需要大能。“判罚”表示这二者，即对恶人的诅咒和对善人的拯救，这一点从圣言中论述最后审判的经文明显看出来，如马太福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.31.htm">25:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.45.htm">45</a>）和别处。</p>

And with great judgments. That this signifies according to the laws of order from the Divine Human of the Lord, is evident from the signification of "judgments," as being truths (see n. 2235, 6397), 
and in the supreme sense, where it is said of the Lord, as being truths Divine; which truths are nothing but the laws of order from the Divine Human of the Lord, for all order is from Him, thus all the 
laws of order. The whole heaven, consequently also the universe, is in accordance with these laws. The laws of order, or the truths which proceed from the Lord, in accordance with which is the whole 
heaven, and the universe, are what are called "the Word by which all things were made" (John 1:1-3); for the "Word" denotes Divine truth proceeding from the Divine good of the Divine Human of the Lord; 
and hence it is that all things in the spiritual world and also in the natural world have relation to truth, as can be seen by him who reflects.  [2] By "great judgments," in the proximate sense, 
are here meant the truths according to which they shall be judged who have infested by means of injected falsities, and who are signified by the "Egyptians" and by "Pharaoh;" and there are also meant 
the truths according to which they shall be judged who will be released from the infestations, and who are signified by the "sons of Israel." By these judgments they are condemned who are in falsities 
from evil, and by these judgments they are saved who are in truths from good. Not that the truths which proceed from the Lord condemn anyone, for all the truths which proceed from the Lord are from His 
Divine good, thus are nothing but mercies. But as men do not receive the mercy of the Lord, they expose themselves to condemnation, because they are then in evils, and evils condemn. Neither do the 
truths which proceed from the Lord save, if the man believes that he is saved by virtue of the truths of faith with him, and not by virtue of mercy; for man is in evils, and from himself is in hell, 
but by virtue of the mercy of the Lord he is withheld from evil and kept in good, and this by a strong force. That by "judgments" both are signified, namely, the condemnation of the evil and the salvation 
of the good, is plain from those passages in the Word where the Last Judgment is treated of, as in Matt. 25:31-45, and elsewhere. </p>

'And with great judgements' means in accordance with the laws of order that spring from the Lord's Divine Human. This is clear from the meaning of 'judgements' as truths, dealt with in <a href="1235.htm">1235</a>, <a href="6797.htm">6797</a>, and 
in the highest sense, in which that word is used in reference to the Lord, as Divine truths, truths which are nothing other than the laws of order that spring from the Lord's Divine Human. For He is 
the origin of all order and so of all the laws of order. Those laws form the structure for the whole of heaven, consequently for the universe also. The laws of order or truths, which emanate from the 
Lord, forming the structure of the whole of heaven and of the universe, are what are called, in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:1-3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:1-3</a>, the Word by which all things were made; for the Word is Divine Truth emanating from the Divine 
Good of the Lord's Divine Human. This means that all things in the spiritual world and also in the natural world have a connection with truth, as anyone who stops to reflect may recognize.  </p>

In the proximate sense here the expression 'great judgements' is used to mean the truths in accordance with which those people will be judged who have molested others by introducing falsities, the ones 
meant by 'the Egyptians' and by 'Pharaoh'. The expression is also used to mean the truths in accordance with which those will be judged who will be released from molestations, the ones meant by 'the 
children of Israel'. By these judgements people steeped in falsities arising from evil are shown to be damned, and by these judgements people guided by truths arising from good are shown to be saved. 
Not that the truths which emanate from the Lord damn anyone, for all truths emanating from the Lord spring from His Divine Goodness, and so are nothing other than expressions of mercy. Rather, people 
expose themselves to damnation because they do not accept the Lord's mercy; for then they are governed by evils, and evils are damning. Nor do the truths emanating from the Lord save anyone if he believes 
that he is saved by virtue of the truths of faith present with him and not by mercy. For a person is full of evils and left to himself is in hell, but by the Lord's mercy he is withheld from evil 
and maintained in good, and with great force. The fact that both are meant by 'judgements', that is to say, both the damnation of those who are evil and the salvation of those who are good, is evident 
from those places in the Word where the last judgement is the subject, such as <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2025:31-45&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 25:31-45</a>, and elsewhere. </p>

`Et judiciis magnis':  quod significet secundum leges ordinis ex Divino Humano Domini, constat ex significatione `judiciorum' quod sint vera, de qua n. 2235, 6397, et in supremo sensu ubi dicitur de 
Domino, quod sint vera Divina, quae vera non aliud sunt quam leges ordinis ex Divino Humano Domini, nam omnis ordo est ab Ipso, ita omnes leges ordinis; secundum illas leges est totum caelum, consequenter 
etiam universum; leges ordinis seu vera quae procedunt a Domino, secundum quae totum caelum ac universum, sunt quae vocantur Verbum per quod omnia facta sunt, apud Johannem i 1-3, nam Verbum est 
Divinum Verum procedens a Divino Bono Divini Humani Domini; inde est quod omnia in mundo spirituali, et quoque in mundo naturali, se referant ad verum, ut constare potest ei qui reflectit. 	2 Per `judicia 
magna' in proximo sensu hic intelliguntur vera secundum quae judicabuntur illi qui per injecta falsa infestarunt, qui significantur per `Aegyptios' et per `Pharaonem'; et quoque intelliguntur vera 
secundum quae judicabuntur illi qui eximentur ab infestationibus, qui significantur per `filios Israelis'; ex judiciis illis damnantur illi qui in falsis ex malo sunt, et ex judiciis illis salvantur 
illi qui in veris ex bono; non quod vera quae procedunt a Domino aliquem damnent, nam omnia vera quae procedunt a Domino sunt ex Divino Bono Ipsius, ita non nisi quam misericordiae; sed quia non recipiunt 
misericordiam Domini, {1} semet ipsos damnationi exponunt, sunt enim tunc in malis, et mala damnant; nec vera quae procedunt a Domino salvant si homo credit quod ex veris fidei apud se salvetur, 
et non ex misericordia; homo enim est in malis, et ex se in inferno, sed ex misericordia Domini detinetur a malo et tenetur in bono, et hoc vi forti.  Quod per `judicia' utrumque significetur, nempe 
(m)tam damnatio malorum quam salvatio bonorum, patet ab illis locis in Verbo ubi agitur de ultimo judicio, ut apud Matth. xxv 31-45, et alibi.(n) 	@1 i ita$ </p>
