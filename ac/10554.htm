<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10554节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10554</strong>.“耶和华与摩西面对面说话”表被结合在一起的圣言中的神性事物。这从“面对面说话”的含义清楚可知，“面对面说话”是指被结合在一起，因为“面（即脸）”表示内层，当内层转向彼此，各自都看到相似之处时，它们就结合在一起。这就是“面对面说话”当论及耶和华向摩西说话时所表示的，摩西表示圣言。“说话”表示觉察，“面对面”表示相互，因此，各自的觉察都存在于对方里面，这构成它们的结合。<br />这意味着这就是圣言的性质，因为“摩西”在此表示圣言。这就是圣言在内在意义和外在意义上的性质；无论在内在意义上还是在外在意义上，它的一切细节都被结合在一起；此外，内在意义上的细节通过对应与外在意义上的细节相结合。这些结合无法描述；即便它们能被描述，也无法被任何思维观念所理解。正是属天和属灵事物在那里被如此结合在一起，正是这些事物通过对应与构成字义的属世和世俗事物相结合。从天上的天使社群结合的方式可在某种程度上获得对这些结合的性质的概念。这些社群合起来构成一个整体，就像人的肢体、内脏和器官，尽管它们各种各样，分别又由内部各种无数部分构成，但仍构成一个整体。圣言中的真理和良善也是这样。人类完全不知道这一事实：这就是圣言的性质；但天使知道，因为他们能感知到圣言内层的相互联系。<br />由此可见，“耶和华与摩西面对面说话”表示被结合在一起的圣言中的神性事物。“面对面说话”表示一回事，“面对面看见耶和华”表示另一回事，这从本章接下来的经文明显可知，在那里，耶和华对摩西说：<br />你不能看见我的面，因为没有人看见我还可以存活。我必将你放在磐石缝里，用我的手掌遮掩你，等我过去。然后我要将我的手掌收回，你就得见我的背，却不得见我的面。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出33.20.htm">33:20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出33.22.htm">22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出33.23.htm">23</a>）<br />“摩西”表示圣言（参看<a href="10549.htm">10549</a>节提到的地方）；“面（即脸）”表示内层（参看<a href="9546.htm">9546</a>节提到的地方）；“说话”表示觉察（参看<a href="10290.htm">10290</a>节提到的地方）。</p>

And Jehovah spoke unto Moses faces to faces. That this signifies the Divine things in the Word conjoined together, is evident from the signification of "speaking faces to faces," as being to be conjoined, 
for by "faces" are signified the interiors, and when the interiors mutually regard each other and see alike, they conjoin themselves together. This is signified by "speaking faces to faces" when 
said of Jehovah speaking unto Moses, by whom is meant the Word; for by "speaking" is signified perception, and by "faces to faces" is signified mutually, consequently the mutual perception of the one 
in that of the other, which is conjunction. [2] This means that such is the nature of the Word, because here "Moses" denotes the Word. For such is the nature of the Word in its internal and in its external. 
In its internal, and also in its external, each and all things have been conjoined together; moreover those which are in its internal are conjoined by means of correspondences with those which 
are in its external. These conjunctions cannot be described, and if they were described, they could not be apprehended by any idea of thought. It is celestial and spiritual things which are there thus 
conjoined together, and it is these which by means of correspondences are conjoined with the natural and worldly things which constitute the sense of the letter. The nature of these conjunctions may 
in some measure be presented to the idea by comparison with the conjunctions of the angelic societies in the heavens, which taken together are a one, just as are the members, viscera, and organs with 
man, which though various, and each of them inwardly consisting of countless various things, nevertheless make a one. Such also is the Word in respect to its truths and goods. That such is the nature 
of the Word is quite unknown to man; but the angels know it, for they perceive the connection of the interior things of the Word.  [3] From all this it can be seen that by "Jehovah speaking unto Moses 
faces to faces" is signified the Divine things in the Word conjoined together. That one thing is signified by "speaking faces to faces," and another by "seeing Jehovah face to face," is evident from 
what follows in this chapter, where Jehovah says unto Moses, "Thou canst not see My faces, because a man doth not see Me and live. But I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee over 
with the palm of My hand, until I have passed by; and I will take away the palm of My hand, and thou shalt see My back parts, and My faces shall not be seen" (verses 20, 22, 23). (That "Moses" denotes 
the Word, see the places cited in n. 10549; that "the faces" denote the interiors, see those cited in n. 9546; and also that "speaking" denotes perception, see those cited in n. 10290.) </p>

'And Jehovah spoke to Moses face to face' means Divine things in the Word that are joined together. This is clear from the meaning of 'speaking face to face' as being joined together, for 'the face' 
means the interiors, and when these turn towards one another and each sees a similarity, they join themselves together. This is what 'speaking face to face' means when it applies to Jehovah talking to 
Moses, by whom the Word is meant. 'Speaking' means perceiving, and 'face to face' mutually, so that each one's perception exists in the other, which constitutes a joining together of them.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 All 
this should be understood in connection with the Word - with its nature as just described - because Moses here means the Word. For such is the nature of the Word in its inward sense and in its outward 
sense; in the inward sense all its details are joined together, and so are all those in the outward sense, and in addition those in the inward sense are joined to those in the outward by means of correspondences. 
These joinings cannot be described; and even if they could be described no ideas exist in the mind to enable it to grasp what they are. They are realities of a celestial and spiritual 
nature which are joined together among themselves in that way there, and by means of correspondences are joined to the images of a natural and worldly nature that constitute the sense of the letter. Some 
conception of what those joinings are like may be gathered from the ways in which angelic communities in the heavens are joined together. These taken together constitute a single whole, just as the 
members, internal organs, and other organs of a human being do, which, though they are various and consist individually of various and countless parts within, nevertheless form a single whole. The truths 
and forms of good in the Word are also like this. Mankind is totally unaware of the fact that the nature of the Word is such; but angels know it because they can perceive the interconnection of 
the interiors of the Word.  </p>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 From all this it becomes clear that 'Jehovah spoke to Moses face to face' means Divine things in the Word that are joined together. One thing is meant by 'speaking face 
to face' and another by 'seeing Jehovah face to face', as is evident from what comes later on in the present chapter, where Jehovah says to Moses,  </p>

`Et locutus est Jehovah ad Moschen facies ad facies':  quod significet Divina in Verbo conjuncta, constat ex significatione `loqui facies ad facies' quod sit conjungi, per `facies' enim significantur 
interiora, et cum interiora se mutuo spectant (c)et vident simile, tunc se conjungunt; hoc significatur per `loqui (x) facies ad facies' cum de Jehovah {1}ad Moschen, per quem intelligitur Verbum, per 
`loqui' enim significatur perceptio, et per `facies ad facies' significatur mutuo, inde perceptio mutua unius in alterius, quae est conjunctio; [2] hoc intelligitur de Verbo, quod tale sit, {2}quoniam 
Moscheh hic est Verbum; Verbum enim tale est in suo interno, et in suo externo; in interno omnia et singula conjuncta sunt, et quoque in externo, et quoque quae in interno sunt cum illis quae in externo 
per correspondentias; conjunctiones illae non describi possunt, et si describerentur, non capi possent aliqua idea cogitationis; sunt {3} caelestia et spiritualia, quae ibi sic inter se conjuncta 
sunt, et haec per correspondentias cum naturalibus et mundanis, quae sensum litterae {4} faciunt; quales conjunctiones sunt, sisti ad ideam aliquatenus potest per conjunctiones societatum angelicarum 
in {5}caelis, quae simul sumptae unum sunt, plane sicut membra, viscera, et organa apud hominem, quae tametsi varia sunt, et quodlibet eorum intus ex innumerabilibus variis {6}consistit, usque unum 
faciunt; tale etiam est Verbum quoad sua vera et bona; quod tale sit Verbum, prorsus nescit homo, sed sciunt angeli, hi enim {7}percipiunt nexum interiorum Verbi. 	[3] Ex his constare potest quod per 
`locutus Jehovah ad Moschen facies ad facies' significentur Divina in Verbo conjuncta. Quod aliud significetur {8} per `loqui facies ad facies,' {9}et aliud per `videre Jehovam facie ad faciem,' patet 
{10}in sequentibus hujus capitis, ubi Jehovah ad Moschen dicit, 	Non potes videre facies Meas, quia non videt Me homo et vivit, sed ponam te in fissura petrae, et obtegam volam Meam super te, usque 
dum pertransivero, et removebo volam Meam, et videbis posteriora Mea, et `facies Meae non videbuntur, vers. 20, 22, 23; </p>
<p>quod `Moscheh' sit Verbum, videatur in locis citatis n. 10549, et quod `facies' 
sint interiora, in locis citatis n. 9546, (c)ac quod `loqui' sit perceptio, in locis citatis n. 10290. @1 et Moscheh$ @2 nam$ @3 enim$ @4 i Verbi$ @5 coelo$ @6 consistunt$ @7 inde suam sapientiam
