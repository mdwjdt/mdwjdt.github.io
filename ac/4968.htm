<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4968节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4968.</strong>“以实玛利人手下”表从简单的良善。这从“以实玛利”的代表清楚可知，“以实玛利”是指那些处于简单良善的人（参看<a href="3263.htm">3263</a>，<a href="4747.htm">4747</a>节），因而在此是指从简单良善那里所得来的属世真理。在创世记37:36，经上说：“米甸人把约瑟卖到埃及，给法老的内臣、护卫长波提乏”；但经上在此则说：“法老的内臣，护卫长波提乏，从那些带下他到那里去的以实玛利人手下买了他去”。这种说话方式是为了内义的缘故；因为前面那句经文论述了神性真理的疏远，这种疏远不是由那些处于简单良善的人造成的，而是由米甸人所代表的那些处于简单真理的人造成的（参看<a href="4788.htm">4788</a>节）。但此处论述的主题是记忆知识的获得或利用，还论述了从简单良善所获得的属世真理。因此，经上说的是“以实玛利人”，因为这些人代表那些处于简单良善的人。由此明显可知，经上是为了内义的缘故而如此说的。历史的叙述也没有任何矛盾之处；因为经上论到米甸人说，他们把约瑟从坑里拉上来，然后把他交给以实玛利人，他被以实玛利人带下埃及。因此，由于米甸人把他交给要往埃及去的以实玛利人，所以把他卖到埃及去的，正是米甸人。</p>

Of the hand of the Ishmaelites. That this signifies from simple good, is evident from the representation of the Ishmaelites, as being those who are in simple good (see n. 3263, 4747), here therefore 
the natural truth which is from simple good. In chapter 37, verse 36, it is so said that the Midianites sold Joseph into Egypt unto Potiphar, Pharaoh's chamberlain, prince of the guards; but here it is 
said that Potiphar, Pharaoh's chamberlain, prince of the guards, bought him of the hand of the Ishmaelites, who had brought him down thither. This way of speaking is used for the sake of the internal 
sense; for in the first instance the alienation of Divine truth is treated of, which is not wrought by those who are in simple good, but by those who are in simple truth, who are represented by the 
Midianites (see n. 4788); but here it treats of the acquisition or attainment of memory-knowledges, and of the natural truth which is from simple good; and therefore it is said "of the Ishmaelites," for 
these represent those who are in simple good. From this it is plain that it is so said for the sake of the internal sense. Nor is there any contradiction in the historical narrative; for it is said 
of the Midianites that they drew Joseph out of the pit, and consequently that they delivered him to the Ishmaelites, by whom he was brought down into Egypt; thus that as the Midianites delivered him 
up to the Ishmaelites who were going to Egypt, they sold him into Egypt. </p>

'From the hand of the Ishmaelites' means from simple good. This is clear from the representation of 'the Ishmaelites' as those in whom simple good is present, dealt with in <a href="3263.htm">3263</a>, <a href="4747.htm">4747</a>, and therefore 
here as natural truth which is received from simple good. Chapter 37:36 says that 'the Midianites sold Joseph into Egypt to Potiphar, Pharaoh's bedchamber servant, the chief of the attendants'; but now 
it is said that 'Potiphar, Pharaoh's bedchamber servant, the chief of the attendants, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites, who made him go down there'. The matter is stated in these different 
ways for the sake of the internal sense. Previously - in Chapter <a href="37.htm">37</a> - the subject was the alienation of Divine truth, which is done not by those in whom simple good exists but by those in whom simple 
truth is present, whom 'the Midianites' represent, see <a href="4788.htm">4788</a> But now the subject is the acquisition or the availing oneself of factual knowledge; also natural truth, which is acquired from simple good. 
This is why the expression 'from the Ishmaelites' is used, for these people represent those in whom simple good is present. From this it is evident that the matter is stated in the way it is for the 
sake of the internal sense. Nor is there any discrepancy in the historical narrative, for this states that the Midianites drew Joseph out of the pit and then handed him over to the Ishmaelites by whom 
he was led away into Egypt Thus since the Midianites handed him over to the Ishmaelites who were going to Egypt, it was the Midianites who sold him to Egypt. </p>

`E manu Jishmaelitarum':  quod significet a simplici bono, constat ex repraesentatione `Jishmaelitarum' quod sint qui in simplici bono, de qua n. 3263, 4747; hic itaque verum naturale quod (c)a simplici 
bono. In capite xxxvii, vers. 36, dicitur `quod Midianitae vendiderint Josephum ad Aegyptum Potiphari cubiculario Pharaonis, principi satellitum'; hic autem dicitur `quod Potiphar cubicularius 
Pharaonis, princeps satellitum, emerit illum e manu Jishmaelitarum, qui descendere fecerunt eum illuc'; quod ita dicatur, est propter sensum internum; ibi enim agitur de abalienatione veri Divini, 
quae non fit ab illis qui in simplici bono sunt, sed ab illis qui in simplici vero, qui per `Midianitas' {1}repraesentantur, videatur n. 4788; hic autem agitur de comparatione seu addicatione scientificorum, 
et de vero naturali quod a simplici bono, quapropter dicitur `ab Jishmaelitis', per hos enim {1}repraesentantur qui in simplici bono; inde patet quod ita dictum sit propter sensum internum; 
historice nec sibi contrariantur, de Midianitis enim dicitur `quod extraxerint Josephum e fovea', consequenter quod ab illis traditus sit Jishmaelitis, a quibus in Aegyptum deductus est, ita 
quod Midianitae quia tradiderunt illum Jishmaelitis qui irent Aegyptum, vendiderint illum ad Aegyptum. @1 significantur$  </p>
