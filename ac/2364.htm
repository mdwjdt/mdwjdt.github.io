<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2364节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2364.</strong>“就照你们看为好的对待她们吧”表照着他们出于良善接受它的程度而享受。这从这些话的含义，以及当这些话论及“女儿”所表示的情感时的整个思路清楚可知。“罗得出来，到门口”表示罗得谨慎行事（<a href="2356.htm">2356</a>节）。这种谨慎从刚才这句话，以及本节剩下的话明显看出来，也就是说，他们将照着这一切源于良善的程度而享受属于对善与真的情感的幸福；这就是“就照你们看为好的对待她们吧”这句话的含义。照着这一切源于良善的程度而享受在此表示照着他们知道它是良善的程度，没有人被要求超过这种程度。因为所有人都由主通过其信的良善被折向生命的良善。外邦人被如此引导的方式不同于基督徒的；简单人不同于学者的；小孩子不同于成人的。那些生活充满邪恶的人通过照其领悟力避开邪恶、意图良善而被折过来。被关注的是他们的意图或目的，哪怕他们的行为本身并不是善的，但其目的仍为他们提供构成其幸福的某种良善之物和由此流出的生命。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2364</b></p><p><b>2364.</b>
And ye may do unto them as is good in your eyes. That this signifies enjoyment insofar as [they perceived it to be] from good, can be seen even from the sense of the words, as well as from the series, 
when these words are predicated of the affections signified by the "daughters." That Lot applied himself prudently, is signified by his "going out unto them to the door" (n. 2356). This prudence is 
evident from the words just quoted, together with what else is contained in this verse, namely, that they should enjoy the blessedness of the affections of good and of truth, insofar as this was from 
good; which is signified by their "doing unto them as was good in their eyes." To enjoy insofar as this was from good, here means insofar as they knew it to be good, beyond which no one is required to 
go; for all are bent by the Lord to the good of life through the good of their faith, thus Gentiles otherwise than Christians, the simple otherwise than the learned, little children otherwise than adults. 
They who have imbued their life with evil are bent by abstaining from evil and intending good, and by doing this according to their apprehension. It is their intention or end that is regarded; and 
although their acts may not be good in themselves, they nevertheless derive from the end something of good, and of the derivative life, which makes their blessedness. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2364</b></p><p><b>2364.</b>
'And you may do to them as is good in your eyes' means enjoyment insofar as [they perceived them to come] from good. This too becomes clear from the meaning of the words, and also from the train of thought, 
when they have reference to the affections meant by 'daughters'. The fact that he acted cautiously was meant by the statement 'Lot went out to them to the door', <a href="2356.htm">2356</a>. This caution is evident 
from these and the remaining words in this verse - they were to enjoy the blessedness belonging to the affections for good and for truth to the extent that this is derived from good, which is the meaning 
of the statement that they were to do to them as was good in their eyes. Enjoying to the extent it derived from good means in this instance, to the extent that they knew it was good, beyond which 
no one is compelled to go. For all are turned by the Lord to the good of life through the good of their faith. Gentiles are so directed in a different way from Christians; the simple in a different way 
from the learned; and young children in a different way from adults. People whose lives have been stained by evil are turned by means of their refraining from evil and intending good, which they carry 
out according to whatever understanding they possess. It is the intention or the end in view present with them that is observed, and even though their actions are not in themselves good, their end 
in view provides them with some measure of good and of the life flowing from it which constitutes their blessedness. </p>

`Et faciatis eis sicut bonum in oculis vestris': quod significet fruitionem quantum ex bono, etiam constare potest ex sensu verborum, tum a serie, cum ea praedicantur de affectionibus {1}, quae per 
`filias' significantur.  Quod prudenter se applicuerit, significatum est per quod `exivit ad eos Lot ad januam,' n. 2356; ipsa prudentia ex his dictis et reliquis in hoc versu patet, nempe quod fruerentur 
beatitudine affectionum boni et veri, quantum ex bono, quod significatur per quod `facerent eis sicut bonum in oculis eorum'; frui quantum ex bono, hic est quantum scirent quod sit bonum, ultra nemo 
obligatur flectuntur enim omnes a Domino ad bonum vitae per bonum fide eorum, ita aliter gentes quam Christiani, aliter simplices quam docti aliter infantes quam adulti: qui malo imbuerunt vitam, 
ii flectuntur per quod abstineant a malo ac intendant bonum, et hoc faciant secundum captum eorum; intentio seu finis tunc apud eos spectatur, et tametsi actus non sint boni in se, usque a fine trahunt 
aliquid boni (c)ac inde vitae, quod facit beatum eorum. 	@1 i boni et veri.$ </p>
