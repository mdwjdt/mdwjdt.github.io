<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4095节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4095.</strong>创世记31:14-16.拉结和利亚回答雅各说，在我们父亲的家里还有我们可得的分吗？还有我们的产业吗？我们不是被他当作外人吗？因为他卖了我们，吞了我们的银钱。神从我们父亲所夺出来的一切财物，那就是我们和我们孩子们的；现在凡神所对你说的，你只管去行吧！<br />“拉结和利亚回答雅各说”表对真理的情感的回应。“在我们父亲的家里还有我们可得的分吗？还有我们的产业吗”表这些情感与“拉班”所表良善分离的第一个状态。“我们不是被他当作外人吗？因为他卖了我们”表它已经疏远它们，以致它们不再属于它。“吞了我们的银钱”表若它们还不分离，它就要毁灭属于这些情感的真理。“神从我们父亲所夺出来的一切财物，那就是我们和我们孩子们的”表一切都是凭祂自己的能力通过由祂的神性进入祂从居间良善为自己所取之物的流入而获得的，没有任何东西是别人给祂的。“现在凡神所对你说的，你只管去行吧”表主的提供。</p>

Verses 14-16. And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Have we any longer a portion and inheritance in our father's house? Are we not counted of him strangers? For he hath sold us, and devouring 
hath also devoured our silver. For all the riches which God hath taken away from our father, they are ours and our sons'; and now all that God hath said unto thee, do. "And Rachel and Leah answered 
and said unto him," signifies the reciprocity of the affections of truth; "Have we any longer a portion and inheritance in our father's house?" signifies the first state of their separation from the 
good signified by "Laban;" "are we not counted of him strangers? For he hath sold us," signifies that it had estranged them, so that they no longer belonged to it; "and devouring hath also devoured our 
silver," signifies that it would consume the truth of those affections if they were not separated; "for all the riches which God hath taken away from our father, they are ours and our sons'," signifies 
that all things were from His own power, and that nothing was given by anyone, by flowing in from His Divine into that which He took to Himself therefrom; "and now all that God hath said unto thee, 
do," signifies the Lord's providence. </p>

Verses 14-16 And Rachel answered, and Leah, and they said to him, Is there still any portion and inheritance for us in our father's house? Are we not considered strangers by him, for he has sold us,

<p>'Rachel answered, and Leah, 
and they said to him' means a reciprocation by the affections for truth. 'Is there still any portion and inheritance for us in our father's house?' means the first state of the separation of those 
affections from the good meant by 'Laban'. 'Are we not considered strangers by him, for he has sold us' means that it had alienated them so that they did not belong to it any longer. 'And also completely 
consumed our money' means it would destroy the truth belonging to those affections if they were not separated. 'For all the riches which God has snatched from our father belong to us and to our 
sons' means that all had been acquired by His own power and nothing given to Him by anyone else - by flowing in from His Divine into that which He received from [intermediate good]. 'And now do everything 
that God has told you' means the Lord's Providence.

Vers. 14-16.  Et respondit Rachel et Leah, et dixerunt ei An amplius nobis portio et hereditas in domo patris nostri?  Anno: </p>
<p>alienae existimatae sumus ei, quia vendidit nos, et comedit etiam comedendo 
argentum nostrum?  Quia omnes divitiae quas eripuit Deus a patre nostro, nobis illae et filiis nostris; et nunc omne quod dixit Deus ad te, fac. `Respondit Rachel et Leah, et dixerunt ei' significat 
reciprocum affectionum veri: `An amplius nobis portio et hereditas in domo patris nostri?' significat statum primum separationis illarum a bono per Labanem significato: `annon alienae existimatae 
sumus ei, quia vendidit nos' significat quod abalienaverit illas, ut non ejus essent amplius: `et comedit etiam comedendo argentum nostrum' significat verum illarum affectionum quod consumeret, 
si non separarentur: `quia omnes divitiae quas eripuit Deus a patre nostro, nobis illae et filiis nostris' significat quod omnia ex propria potentia, et nihil ab aliquo datum, influendo a Divino 
Suo in id quod inde acciperet: `et nunc omne quod dixit Deus ad te, fac' significat Providentiam Domini. </p>
