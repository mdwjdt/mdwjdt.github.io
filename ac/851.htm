<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>851.</strong>“方舟停”表重生。这一点从以下事实明显可知：即“方舟”表该教会成员；凡在方舟里的表在他里面的全部事物，如前面充分说明的。因此，说“方舟停”意思是说这个成员正在重生。字义甚至似乎也暗示“方舟停”表随试探而来的摇摆（如前所述）停止了；但摇摆，即对真理和良善的疑惑和模糊，并没有以这种方式停止，而是持续了很长时间，这从下文明显可知。显然，思维的连续性在内义上是不同的。由于这思维的实体是奥秘，故在此予以揭示，即：属灵之人经历试探后会变成主的“安息”，其方式与属天之人的一样。他还以相同的方式变成“第七”，但并非如属天之人那样是第七日，而是“第七月”。关于属天之人是主的安息或安息日和第七日的详细论述，可参看84-88节。但由于属天之人与属灵之人彼此截然不同，故原文用“安息日”一词来表示属天之人的安息，而用另外一个词来表示属灵之人的安息，挪亚这个名即源于此，它尤指安息。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]851.</strong> The symbolism of the ark came to rest as rebirth can be seen from this, that the ark symbolizes the people of this church, and everything in the ark symbolizes what those people had inside them, as shown frequently above [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_851/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_602" target=_top>602</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_851/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_638" target=_top>638-658</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_851/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_667" target=_top>667-681</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_851/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_713" target=_top>713-726</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_851/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_740" target=_top>740-751</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_851/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_764" target=_top>764-784</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_851/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_811" target=_top>811</a>]. When the ark is said to have come to rest, then, the meaning is that the same people were regenerating.<br />The literal story line does indeed seem to suggest that the settling of the ark symbolizes an end to the wavering (discussed at the last verse) that followed their trials. The wavering, however, which is doubt and confusion about truth and goodness, does not end here but lasts a long time, as will also become clear below.{*1} This shows that the inner sense always has some other implication; and since that implication is unknown, let me reveal it here. After spiritual people have endured tribulation, they too become the Lord's rest, just as the heavenly person does, and they also become a seventh thing — not the seventh day, as the heavenly person does, but the seventh month. Concerning the heavenly person as the Lord's Sabbath rest and as the seventh day, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_851/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_84" target=_top>84-88</a>. Since there is a difference between heavenly and spiritual people, though, the original language uses a word meaning "Sabbath" for the heavenly person's repose and another, from which the name Noah comes and which more strictly means "rest," for the spiritual person's repose.{*2} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For this long period of vacillation, see the sections from here up to the explanation of verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_851/bible_king-james-version_genesis_8_12" target=_top>12</a> (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_851/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_888" target=_top>888-892</a>), where Swedenborg describes the process of gradual enlightenment as finally coming to completion. [LHC]<br />{*2} On the meaning of "Noah," see note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_851/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_459" target=_top>459</a>. "Sabbath" comes from the Hebrew שָׁבַת (šāḇaṯ), a verb that also means "rest," but has a different root than the word for "Noah." Swedenborg indicates here that the two terms are used for different levels of spiritual development. [RS] </p>

That "the ark rested" signifies regeneration, is evident from the fact that the "ark" signifies the man of this church; and that all the things which it contained signify all the things that were in 
him, as has been fully shown before. When therefore the ark is said to "rest" it means that this man was being regenerated. The connection of the literal sense may indeed seem to imply that by the ark's 
"resting" is signified the cessation of the fluctuations that follow temptation (spoken of in the preceding verse); but fluctuations, which are doubts and obscurities concerning what is true and good, 
do not so cease, but persist for a long time, as will be evident from what follows. Hence it is evident that the continuity of things is different in the internal sense; and as they are arcana, it 
is permitted here to unfold them; and they are that the spiritual man, like the celestial, after enduring temptations, becomes in like manner the "rest" of the Lord; and further, that he in like manner 
becomes the seventh (not the seventh day, like the celestial man, but the seventh) month. (Concerning the celestial man as being the rest of the Lord, or the Sabbath, and the seventh day, see above, 
n. 84-88.) As however there is a difference between the celestial man and the spiritual man, the "rest" of the former is expressed in the original language by a word which means the Sabbath, while the 
"rest" of the latter is expressed by another term, from which he is named "Noah" which properly means "rest." </p>

That 'the ark rested' means regeneration becomes clear from the fact that 'the ark' means the member of this Church, and all that was in the ark means all that resided with that member, as shown extensively 
already. When therefore the ark is said 'to rest' it means that this member was being regenerated. The train of thought in the sense of the letter does indeed seem to imply that 'the ark's resting' 
means that the fluctuations following temptation, dealt with in the previous verse, have come to an end. But fluctuations, which are doubt and haziness concerning truths and goods, do not in that 
manner come to an end but persist for a long time, as will also be clear later on. From this it is clear that the continuity of thought in the internal sense is different. The substance of that thought, 
being arcana, can be revealed here, namely this: After he has undergone temptations the spiritual man becomes the Lord's 'rest' in the same way as the celestial man does. In the same way also he 
becomes 'the seventh', not however the seventh day, as the celestial man does, but 'the seventh month'. For details concerning the celestial man's being the Lord's rest or sabbath, and the seventh day, 
see <a href="84.htm">84</a>-<a href="88.htm">88</a>. But as a celestial man and a spiritual man are different from each other the celestial man's rest is expressed in the original language by a word meaning the sabbath, whereas the spiritual 
man's rest is expressed by a different word, from which the name Noah derives which specifically means rest. </p>

</p><b>851.</b>
Quod 'quieverit arca' significet regenerationem, constare potest ex eo quod 'arca' significet hominem hujus Ecclesiae et omnia quae in illa, quae apud illum hominem, ut prius multis ostensum est; cum 
itaque arca 'quiescere' dicitur, est quod hic homo regeneretur: ex serie sensus litterae quidem involvi videtur, quod per 'quiescere arcam' significetur quod fluctuationes post tentationem, de quibus 
in vers. praec., cessaverint, sed fluctuationes, quae sunt dubia et obscuritates de veris et bonis, non cessant ita sed diu perstant, ut quoque ex sequentibus constabit; inde constat quod continua alia 
in sensu interno sint; quae quia arcana, hic licet aperire, nempe quod homo spiritualis, postquam sustinuit tentationes, similiter fiat quies Domini sicut homo caelestis; tum quoque quod similiter 
fiat septimus, non 'dies septimus' ut homo caelestis, sed 'mensis septimus'; de homine caelesti, quod sit quies Domini seu sabbatum et quod sit septimus dies, videatur n. 84-88; sed quia differentia 
est inter hominem caelestem et hominem spiritualem, illius quies exprimitur in lingua originali per vocem quae significat sabbatum, hujus autem quies per vocem aliam, ex qua nominatus Noah, qui proprie 
est quies. </p>
