<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第642节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>642.</strong>这些分析清楚表明，对方舟的初次描述所涉及的一切被保存起来，免于洪水淹没，包括它的哥斐木建造物、舟内房间、内外所抹的柏油，即属意愿的这部分。只有属觉知的那部分敞开，这在第16节经文通过窗、门、上中下三层被描述出来。这些事很难令人相信，因为它们至今尚未进入人的思维。尽管如此，它们却是千真万确的。然而，这些是人类所不知的最不起眼、最为一般的奥秘。若告知他们细节，恐怕他们一个也不理解。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]642.</strong> Such observations clarify what this initial description of the ark involves, in requiring that the ark be built out of gopher wood, be divided into compartments,{*1} and be tarred outside and in with tar. The meaning is that this second side — the will side — would be protected from the Flood and only the intellectual side would lie open, as depicted in verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_642/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_16" target=_top>16</a> by the window, the door, and the lowest, second, and third levels.<br />Maybe these ideas seem unbelievable because they have never occurred to anyone before and people have not pictured the Lord's Word this way. Yet they are completely true. However, they represent the simplest and most general type of secret hidden from human knowledge. If I delved into the details, nobody would comprehend even a single one.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The translation here is based on reading "that [there were to be] compartments" (quod mansiones) for the first Latin edition's "what the compartments [were]" (quid mansiones). The original Latin is plausible in itself, but does not accurately represent the verse it summarizes, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_642/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_14" target=_top>Genesis 6:14</a>. Elliott's translation (Swedenborg [1749-1756] 1983-1999) also assumes the emendation. [LHC] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 642</b></p><p><b>642.</b>
From all this it is evident what this first description of the ark involves, with its construction of gopher wood, its mansions, and its coating within and without with pitch, namely, that one part, 
that of the will, was preserved from inundation; and only that part opened which is of the understanding, and is described, in verse 16, by the window, the door, and the lowest, second, and third stories. 
These things are not easily believed, because hitherto no one has had any idea of them. And yet they are most true. But these are the least and most general of the hidden meanings which man is ignorant 
of. If the individual particulars were told him, he could not apprehend even one of them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 642</b></p><p><b>642.</b>
These considerations make clear what is embodied in this first description of the ark which shows that it was constructed from 'planks of gopher', had 'rooms', and was 'bitumened with bitumen outside 
and in', namely that the second part, which is that of the will, was preserved from the deluge, and that the only part open was that of the understanding, which is described in verse 16 by the window, 
the door, and the lowest, second, and third storeys. These matters are perhaps hard to believe because they have not as yet entered anybody's thinking, and because people have no such conception of 
the Word of the Lord. Nevertheless they are absolutely true. Yet these are the least and most general of the arcana that mankind does not know. If the details were told them they would not grasp a single one. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 642</b>
</p><b>642.</b>
Ex his constare potest quid involvit prima haec arcae descriptio quod constructa sit ex 'lignis gopher,' quid 'mansiones,' tum quod 'bitumine foris et intus bituminaretur'; nempe quod altera illa pars 
quae voluntatis, conservaretur ab {x}inundatione; et solam aperiretur illa pars quae est intellectus, quae describitur, vers. 16, per 'fenestram, januam, infimas, secundanas et tertianas.' Haec forte 
incredibilia sunt quia in nullus ideam adhuc venerunt, et quia non talem conceptum habuerunt de Verbo Domini, usque tamen verissima sunt: sed haec minima et communissima arcana sunt, quae homo nescit; 
si ei singularia dicerentur ne quidem unum caperet. </p>
