<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7398节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7398.</strong>“只在河中存活呢”表它们注定留在虚假那里，留在这些虚假所在的地方。这从“河”和“存活”的含义清楚可知：“河”，此处即埃及河，是指虚假（参看<a href="6693.htm">6693</a>，<a href="7307.htm">7307</a>节）；“存活”是指留在。情况是这样：进入人心智的一切，尤其出于情感所接受的，都留在他那里。人们以为当一个人不再记得所进入的东西时，这些东西已经完全被根除和逐出。但它们并没有被根除或逐出，而是要么牢牢存留在内部记忆中，要么存留在外部记忆中，就在那些已被此人所熟悉的事物当中。因为已经熟悉的事物可以说是本能的；它们自动流出，不被任何来自记忆的有意识的召唤激发。人的言语就是这样，他所用的词语自动从他的思维流出，举止、行为，甚至走路也是这样。这也适用于思维。这些能力自婴儿时就先后进入，并随着时间推移而变得熟悉起来，然后自然而然地流出。从这些能力和其它类似能力明显可知，进入人里面的一切都会保留下来；变成习惯，也就是变得熟悉的事物则不再被认为存在于他里面，尽管它们就存在于他里面。这同样适用于进入人的虚假和邪恶，以及真理和良善。正是这些东西塑造了他，决定了他的品质。人所曾看见、听见、思想、说过、做过的一切都记录在他里面，铭刻在他身上（参看<a href="2474.htm">2474</a>-<a href="2489.htm">2489</a>节）。由此可见当如何理解这个观念：推理注定留在虚假那里，在这些虚假所在的地方。因为虚假被移除之后，它们，以及推理的努力和欲望，连同这些虚假在属世层中的别处被指定自己的地方。不过，它们不像以前那样是心智关注的中心和直接对象。这解释了为何如下文所描述的那样，青蛙被聚拢成堆，这地因它们而发臭，以此表示这些虚假的推理在属世层中被排列成捆，由此在那里产生肮脏恶臭、令人厌恶的东西（参看<a href="7408.htm">7408</a>，<a href="7409.htm">7409</a>节）。</p>

Only in the river shall they be left. That this signifies that they should remain with the falsities where these are, is evident from the signification of "river," here the river of Egypt, as being falsity 
(see n. 6693, 7307); and from the signification of "being left," as being to remain. With this the case is that whatever enters with man, remains with him, especially what is received from affection. 
It is believed that the things which enter have been completely obliterated and cast out when the man no longer remembers them; but they have not been obliterated or cast out, but they stick fast 
either in the interior memory, or in the exterior, among things which have become familiar. For the things which become familiar, are as it were natural, which flow of their own accord, and are not 
excited by a conscious recalling from the memory; like man's speech, the words of which flow spontaneously from thought, as also do the gestures and actions, and even the steps; and also the thought. 
These enter successively from infancy, and in time become familiar, and then flow spontaneously. From these as well as from other similar facts, it is evident that all things which enter with man, remain, 
and that the things which have become habitual, that is, familiar, are no longer noticed as being in the man, although they are in him. Such is the case with the falsities and evils that enter with 
man, and also with the truths and goods. Such are the things that form him and determine his quality. (That all things which a man has seen, heard, thought, spoken, and done, have been inscribed on 
him, (see n. 2474-2489.) From all this it is now evident how it is to be understood that the reasonings would remain with the falsities where these are; for after falsities are being removed, they are 
allotted their places elsewhere in the natural, and together with the falsities the endeavor and cupidity of reasoning; but not as before in the midst directly under the mind's view. Hence it is that, 
as related in what follows, the frogs were gathered together in heaps, and the land stank by reason of them, whereby is signified that these reasoning falsities were arranged in bundles in the natural, 
and there was what was foul and loathsome therefrom (see below, n. 7408, 7409). </p>

'Survive only in the river?' means that they are destined to remain with falsities, in the place where these reside. This is clear from the meaning of 'the river,' here the river of Egypt, as falsity, 
dealt with in <a href="6693.htm">6693</a>, <a href="7307.htm">7307</a>; and from the meaning of 'surviving' as remaining. The situation is this: Everything without exception that enters a person's mind remains with him, especially what is received 
with affection. People think that what enters has been completely eradicated and cast out when a person no longer recollects it. But it has been neither eradicated nor cast out; rather, it remains 
infixed either in the interior memory or among those thing in the exterior memory which have become familiar to the person. For what has become familiar is so to speak instinctive; it flows spontaneously 
and is not stimulated by any conscious summoning from the memory. A person's speech is like this; the words he uses flow spontaneously from his thought, as do gestures and actions, and indeed his 
walk. The same applies also to thinking. These abilities enter in successive stages from infancy, and in time become familiar, when they flow spontaneously. These abilities, and others like them show 
that everything entering a person remains, and that things which become habitual, that is, familiar, cease to be recognized by him as being present in him, although they are present. The same applies 
to the falsities and evils entering a person, and also the truths and forms of good. Such things are what fashion him and make him the kind of person he is. Everything a person has seen, heard, thought, 
spoken, or done is recorded within him, see <a href="2474.htm">2474</a>, <a href="2489.htm">2489</a>. From all this one may now see how one should understand the idea that reasonings are destined to remain with falsities, in the place where these 
reside. For after falsities have been removed they are allotted places of their own elsewhere in the natural, and with the falsities go the endeavour and desire to use reasonings. But they are not, 
as they were before, the central and immediate object of mental attention. This explains why, as described in what follows, the frogs were gathered into heaps, and caused the land to stink, meaning 
that those false reasonings were arranged in the natural into bundles, producing what was foul and repulsive, see below in <a href="7408.htm">7408</a>, <a href="7409.htm">7409</a>. </p>

`Tantum in fluvio supererunt':  quod significet quod remansurae cum falsis ubi illa, constat ex significatione `fluvii,' hic fluvii Aegypti, quod sit falsum, de qua n. 6693, 7307; et ex significatione 
`superesse' quod sit remanere.  Cum hoc ita se habet: omnia quaecumque intrant apud hominem, {1}remanent apud illum, imprimis illa quae ex affectione recipiuntur; creditur quod illa quae intrant prorsus 
obliterata et ejecta sint, cum {2} homo illorum non amplius reminiscitur, sed {3} non obliterata aut ejecta sunt, {4}verum inhaerent, vel in interiore memoria, vel in exteriore inter illa quae familiaria 
facta sunt; quae enim familiaria fiunt {5}sunt sicut naturalia, quae fluunt sua sponte, et non ex sensibili revocatione ex memoria exciuntur; (s)sicut loquela hominis, cujus voces ex cogitatione 
sponte {6}affluunt, etiam gestus et actiones, immo {7} gressus; ut quoque cogitare; haec intrant ab infantia successive, et tempore fiunt familiaria, et tunc sua sponte fluunt; ex quibus, {8}ut ex 
similibus aliis, constat quod omnia quae intrant apud hominem remaneant, et quod quae habitum traxerunt, hoc est, quae familiaria facta sunt, non amplius appercipiantur inesse cum tamen insunt;(s) ita 
se habet cum falsis et {9} malis quae intrant apud hominem; et quoque cum veris et {9} bonis; talia sunt quae {10}formant illum, et faciunt ut talis sit; quod omnia quae homo vidit, audivit, cogitavit, 
locutus est, et egit, inscripta sint, videatur n. 2474, 2489.  Ex his nunc {11}patet quomodo intelligendum quod ratiocinationes remansurae cum falsis ubi illa; falsa enim postquam removentur, sua 
loca alibi in naturali sortiuntur, et cum falsis conatus et {12}cupiditas ratiocinandi; sed non, ut prius, in medio directe sub intuitione mentis.  Inde est quod, ut in sequentibus {13}memoratur, `ranae 
congregatae sint in acervos' et quod ex illis `putuerit terra,' per quae significatur quod falsa illa ratiocinantia fasciculatim in naturali disposita sint, et quod inde taetrum et aversatile, vide
