<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4009节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4009.</strong>“交在他儿子们的手下”表被单独挑出来的真理与良善被赋予真理。这从“儿子”的含义清楚可知，“儿子”是指真理（<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="2623.htm">2623</a>，<a href="3373.htm">3373</a>节）。“交在他们手里”是指赋予他们权柄，因为“手”表示权能或能力（<a href="878.htm">878</a>，<a href="3387.htm">3387</a>节）。此处“儿子”所表示的真理就是那些被称为感官真理的真理，因为它们属于感官，是属世心智的边界。因为人心智的属世层一边与属于身体的感官印象相通，一边与属于理性心智的理性概念相通。这些居间物可以说提供了一条从属于身体并向尘世敞开的感官印象到属于理性心智并向天堂敞开的理性概念的上升通道。它们以同样的方式还提供了一条从天堂降至尘世的通道；不过，这一切只在人里面实现。这种上升和下降就是此处创世记的这些章节在内义上所论述的；为了代表性地展现每一个事物，理性层就由以撒和利百加来代表；属世层由雅各和他的两个妻子来代表；感官层则由雅各的儿子们来代表。不过，由于在先之物共存于作为次序终端的感官层，故每个儿子都代表这些在先之物所在的某种共性之物。</p>

And gave them into the hand of his sons. That this signifies that the truths and goods that were separated were given to truths, is evident from the signification of "sons," as being truths (see n. 489, 
491, 533, 2623, 3373). "To give into their hand" is to give to their authority and disposal, for by the "hand" is signified power (n. 878, 3387). The truths here signified by "sons" are those called 
sensuous, because they are of the senses and are the outermost things of the natural mind. For man's natural communicates on the one side with the sensuous things of the body, and on the other side 
with the rational things of the rational mind. By these intermediates there is effected as it were an ascent from the sensuous things that are of the body and that have been opened toward the world, 
to the rational things that are of the rational mind and that have been opened toward heaven; and also a descent from these, that is, from heaven to the world; but this is effected in man only. This ascent 
and descent is that which is treated of in the internal sense of these chapters; and in order that each and all things may be presented representatively, the rational is represented by Isaac and 
Rebekah; the natural by Jacob and his two women; and the sensuous by their sons. But because in the sensuous, as in the ultimate of order, prior things exist together, as before shown every son represents 
some general in which they are. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4009</b></p><p><b>4009.</b>
'And he gave them into the hand of his sons' means that they were given to truths. This is clear from the meaning of 'sons' as truths, dealt with in <a href="489.htm">489</a>, <a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="533.htm">533</a>, <a href="2623.htm">2623</a>, <a href="3373.htm">3373</a>. 'Giving into their hand' 
means giving them the right of control, for 'the hand' means power, <a href="878.htm">878</a>, <a href="3387.htm">3387</a>. The truths which are meant by 'sons' in this case are those which are called sensory truths, for what the senses perceive 
as truths exist as the boundaries of the natural mind. For the natural degree of man's mind communicates on one side with sensory impressions which belong to the body and on the other side with the 
rational concepts which belong to the rational mind. By means of what lies in between a way of ascent so to speak is provided from sensory impressions which belong to the body, and are open in the direction 
of the world, up to the rational concepts which belong to the rational mind and are open in the direction of heaven. And in the same manner they provide a way of descent, that is to say, from 
heaven down to the world. This situation exists only with man. It is this ascent and descent that is dealt with in the internal sense of the chapters at this point in Genesis. And in order that every 
single thing may be expressed representatively, the rational is represented by Isaac and Rebekah, the natural by Jacob and both his wives, and the sensory awareness by the latters' sons. But since the 
sensory awareness as the ultimate degree of order incorporates everything prior to it each son represents something general in which those things are present, as shown above. </p>

`Et dedit in manum filiorum ejus': quod significet quod darentur illa veris, constat a significatione `filiorum' quod sint vera; de qua n. 489, 491, 533, 2623, 3373; `dare in manum illorum' est juri 
et arbitrio eorum, per `manum' enim significatur potentia, n. 878, 3387, vera quae per filios hic significantur, sunt {1}quae vocantur sensualia, sunt enim sensualium, et sunt extima mentis naturalis; 
naturale enim hominis ab una parte communicat cum sensualibus quae sunt corporis, et ab altera parte cum rationalibus quae sunt mentis rationalis, per intermedia illa fit quasi ascensus a sensualibus 
quae sunt corporis et aperta sunt versus mundum, ad rationalia quae sunt mentis rationalis, et aperta sunt versus caelum, ita quoque descensus ab illis, nempe a caelo ad mundum; hoc fit 
in solo homine: hic ascensus et descensus est, de quo agitur in sensu interno horum capitum; ac ut repraesentative sistantur omnia et singula, repraesentatur rationale per `Jishakum et Rebeccam,' naturale 
per `Jacobum et binas ejus mulieres,' et sensuale per `horum filios'; at quia in sensuali ut in ultimo ordinis, priora simul sunt, unusquisque filius aliquod commune repraesentat in quo illa, 
ut supra ostensum est. </p>
