<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10825节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10825</strong>.在教会，众所周知，主从父耶和华成孕，因而自成孕时就是神，还知道祂带着整个身体复活，因为祂在坟墓里什么也没留下。对此，后来祂也向门徒证明了，当时祂说：<br />你们看我的手，我的脚，分明是我自己；摸我看看！灵无肉无骨，你们看，我是有的。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.39.htm">24:39</a>）<br />祂虽骨肉俱全，但仍能穿过紧闭的门进来；祂显现自己之后又不见了（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约20.19.htm">20:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约20.26.htm">26</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.31.htm">24:31</a>）。祂在这方面不同于其他任何人，因为其他人的灵会复活，但身体不会复活。因此，当祂说，祂不是一个灵时，祂是在说，祂和其他任何人都不一样。由此明显可知，在主里面的人身是神性。</p>

That the Lord was conceived of Jehovah the Father and thus was God from conception, is known in the church, and also that He rose again with His whole body, for He left nothing in the sepulchre. Of this 
He also afterward confirmed His disciples, saying, "Behold My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself; feel Me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see Me have" (Luke 24:39). And although 
He was a man in respect to the flesh and bones, He nevertheless entered in through closed doors; and after He had manifested Himself He again became invisible (John 20:19, 26; Luke 24:31). It 
is different with every man, for a man rises again only as to the spirit, and not as to the body; and therefore when He said that He is not a spirit, He said that He is not like any other man. From this 
it is now evident that in the Lord the Human also is Divine. </p>

It is well known in the Church that the Lord was conceived from Jehovah as the Father, so that from conception He was God, and also that He rose again with His whole body, for He left nothing in the 
tomb, as He also afterwards proved to the disciples when He said,  </p>
<blockquote>
See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself; handle Me and see; for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see Me have. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2024:39&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 24:39</a>.  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
And although He was Man complete with flesh and bones, yet He entered through closed doors and after revealing Himself became invisible, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2020:19,26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 20:19,26</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2024:31&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 24:31</a>. 
</blockquote>
In this respect He was 
different from anyone else, for everyone else's spirit rises again but not the body. When therefore He said that He was not like a spirit He was saying that He was not like everyone else. From this 
it is now evident that even the Human within the Lord is Divine.  </p>

</p><b>10825.</b>
Quod Dominus conceptus sit (c)a Jehovah Patre, et sic a conceptione Deus, notum est in Ecclesia; et quoque quod resurrexerit cum toto corpore, nam nihil reliquit in sepulcro, de quo etiam postea confirmavit 
discipulos, dicendo, 	Videte manus Meus et pedes Meos, quod Ipse Ego sim; palpate Me et videte, nam spiritus carnem et ossa non habet sicut Me videtis habere, Luc. xxiv 39; </p>
<p>et tametsi fuit 
homo quoad carnem et ossa, usque intravit per fores clausas, ac postquam Se manifestavit, invisibilis factus est, Joh. xx 19, 26; Luc. xxiv 31.  Secus fit omni homini, homo enim modo quoad spiritum et 
non quoad corpus resurgit, quare cum dixit quod non sit sicut spiritus, dixit quod non sit sicut alius homo.  Inde nunc patet quod etiam Humanum in Domino Divinum sit. </p>
