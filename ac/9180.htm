<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9180节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9180.</strong>“就要为雇价而来”表柔顺并服从。这从“为雇价而来”的含义清楚可知，“为雇价而来”是指使自己柔顺并服从。此处的情形是这样：有些人从圣言，或教会的教义，或其他任何人，甚至通过推断得出结论而从自己学习并吸收真理。但这些人如此行是为了利益，也就是为了获得重要地位或财富，要么是为了值得天堂。“为雇价而来”在内义上就表示这些人，也就是说，他们必须使自己柔顺并服从。就一个属教会的人而言，自身利益应占据末位，而不是占据首位。当自身利益占据末位时，它就是一个仆人；但它若占据首位，就是一个主人。首先关注自身利益的人是一个颠倒的人，在来世也表现为一个头在地狱的颠倒之人。而首先关注仁与信，因而关注主与邻舍的人则是一个直立的人，在来世表现为挺直站立，头在天堂。由此明显可知为了自身利益行善是什么意思；这良善必须使自己柔顺并服从，这些事由“他若是雇工，就要为雇价而来”来表示。</p>

He shall come in his hire. That this signifies submission and service, is evident from the signification of "coming in his hire," as being to submit one's self and serve. The case herein is this. Those 
who learn and draw forth truths from the Word, or from the doctrine of the church, or from anyone soever, or even by means of inferences, from themselves, for the sake of self-advantage, that is, in 
order that they may acquire honors or wealth, or that they may merit heaven; are those who are meant in the internal sense by "hirelings who shall come in their hire," that is, who will submit themselves 
and serve. For self-advantage ought to be in the last place with the man of the church, and not in the first. When it is in the last place, it is a servant; but if it is in the first place, it is 
a lord. He who regards self-advantage in the first place is an inverted man, and in the other life is also represented as being so, with his head in hell; but he who regards charity and faith in the 
first place, and thus the Lord and the neighbor, is an upright man, and in the other life is represented as standing so, with his head in heaven. From this it is evident what is meant by good done for 
the sake of self-advantage; and that this good must submit itself and serve, which things are signified by "if a hireling be with it, he shall come in his hire." </p>

'He shall come in his hire' means being submissive and subservient. This is clear from the meaning of 'coming in one's hire' as submitting oneself and being subservient. The implications of this are 
as follows: There are people who learn and absorb truths from the Word, or from the teachings of the Church, or else from others whoever they may be, even from themselves by drawing their own conclusions. 
But these people do so for the sake of gain, that is, to earn important positions or wealth, or else to merit heaven. Such people are meant in the internal sense by 'hired servants who shall come 
in their hire', that is, who must submit themselves and serve. So far as one who belongs to the Church is concerned, forms of gain occupy the last place, not the first; and when they occupy the last 
place they are servants, but if they occupy the first they are masters. The person who sees gain as that which occupies first place is someone turned upside down, and is also represented in the next life 
as someone turned upside down with his head in hell. But the person who sees charity and faith, thus the Lord and the neighbour, as that which occupies first place is someone who is the right way 
up and stands the right way up in the next life with his head in heaven. This shows what is meant by good that is done for the sake of reward, and that this good must be submissive and subservient, meant 
by 'If he is a hired servant he shall come in his hire'.  </p>

</p><b>9180.</b>
`Veniet in mercede sua': quod significet submissionem et servitium, constat ex significatione `venire in mercede' quod sit se submittere et servire.  Cum hoc ita se habet: qui ex Verbo, aut ex doctrina 
Ecclesiae {1}, aut quoque ex aliis quibuscumque, immo qui a semet ipsis per conclusiones, discunt et hauriunt vera lucri causa, hoc est, ut lucrentur honores aut opes, aut quoque ut mereantur caelum, 
illi sunt qui in sensu interno intelliguntur per mercenarios qui venient in mercede sua, hoc est, qui se submittent et servient; lucra enim erunt ultimo loco homini Ecclesiae, non primo; cum ultimo 
loco sunt, tunc servi sunt, at si primo {2}, domini sunt; qui primo loco spectat lucra, is inversus homo est, et quoque repraesentatur ut inversus in altera vita, capite in inferno, at qui primo loco 
spectat charitatem et fidem, (o)ita Dominum et proximum, is erectus homo est et quoque sistitur erectus in altera vita, capite in caelo; inde patet quid intelligitur per bonum quod fit lucri causa, 
et quod id submittetur (c)et serviet, quae significantur per {3}`si mercenarius ille {4}, quod venturus in mercede sua.' @1 e Verbo$ @2 i loco$ @3 i quod$ @4 cum illo AIT$ </p>
