Verses 31-34. And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and will tell Pharaoh, and will say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan, 
are come unto me; and the men are shepherds of the flock, for they are men of cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have. And it may be that Pharaoh will 
call you, and will say, What are your works? And ye shall say, Thy servants have been men of cattle from their youth even until now, both we, and our fathers; in order that ye may dwell in the land 
of Goshen; for every shepherd of the flock is an abomination of the Egyptians.  "And Joseph said unto his brethren," signifies the perception of truths in the natural; "and unto his father's house" signifies 
of goods there; "I will go up and will tell Pharaoh" signifies communication with the natural where are the memory-knowledges of the church; "and will say unto him, My brethren, and my father's 
house, who were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me," signifies in respect to the truths and the goods of the church, that they are to be initiated; "and the men are shepherds of the flock," signifies 
that they lead to good; "for they are men of cattle," signifies that they have good from truths; "and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have," signifies that good 
interior and exterior, and whatever is thence, is present; "and it may be that Pharaoh will call you," signifies if the natural in which are the memory-knowledges of the church wills to be conjoined; 
"and will say, What are your works?" signifies and to know your goods; "and ye shall say, Thy servants have been men of cattle from their youth even until now," signifies that from the beginning and 
as yet they have truths from which is good; "both we, and our fathers" signifies that it was so from the first goods; "in order that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen," signifies so shall your residence 
be in the midst of the natural where are the memory-knowledges of the church; "for every shepherd of the flock is an abomination of the Egyptians," signifies separation thus from perverted memory-knowledges 
which are opposed to the memory-knowledges of the church. </p>

Verses 31-34 And Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's house, I will go up and tell Pharaoh, and say to him, My brothers and my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to 
me. And the men are shepherds of the flock, for they are keepers<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of livestock, and their flocks and their herds, and all that they have, they have made to come. And it may be, that Pharaoh may call you 
and say, What are your works?<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> And you are to say, Your servants have been keepers<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of livestock from our<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> boyhoods and right up to now, both we and our fathers - so that you may dwell in the land 
of Goshen; for every shepherd of the flock is an abomination to the Egyptians. </p>
<p>'And Joseph said to his brothers' means a perception by the truths in the natural. 'And to his father's house' means 
by the forms of good there. 'I will go up and tell Pharaoh' means a communication with the natural, where the Church's factual knowledge resides. 'And say to him, My brothers and my father's house, 
who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me' means that the truths and forms of good which the Church possesses are to be introduced [into that knowledge]. 'And the men are shepherds of the flock' 
means that they lead to good. 'For they are keepers of livestock' means that they possess good deriving from truths. 'And their flocks and their herds, and all that they have, they have made to come' 
means that interior good and exterior good, and whatever is dependent on them, are present. 'And it may be, that Pharaoh may call you' means if the natural in which the Church's factual knowledge resides 
wishes to be joined to you. 'And says, What are your works?' means and to know your forms of good. 'And you are to say, Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our boyhoods and right up 
to now' means that the truths which lead to good have been present from the beginning and are present still. 'Both we and our fathers' means that this was so from when the earliest forms of good existed. 
'So that you may dwell in the land of Goshen' means that your position will for that reason be in the middle of the natural where the Church's factual knowledge resides. 'For every shepherd is an 
abomination to the Egyptians' means thereby a separation from perverted factual knowledge which is opposed to the Church's factual knowledge.

Vers. 31-34.  Et dixit Joseph ad fratres suos, et ad domum patris sui, Ascendam et indicabo Pharaoni, et dicam ad illum, Fratres mei et domus patris mei, qui in terra Canaan, venerunt ad me.  Et viri 
pastores gregis, quia viri pecoris sunt; et greges suos et armenta sua, et omnia quae illis, venire fecerunt.  Et sit quod vocet vos Pharaoh, et dicat, Quid opera vestra? Et dicatis, Viri pecoris fuerunt 
servi tui a pueritiis suis, et usque ad nunc, etiam nos etiam patres nostri; propterea ut habitetis in terra Goshen; quia abominatio Aegyptiorum omnis pastor gregis.  `Et dixit Joseph ad fratres 
suos' significat perceptionem verorum in naturali:  `et ad domum patris sui' significat bonorum ibi: `Ascendam et indicabo Pharaoni' significat communicationem cum naturali ubi scientifica Ecclesiae: 
 `et dicam ad illum, Fratres mei et domus patris mei, qui in terra Canaan, venerunt ad me' significat de veris et bonis Ecclesiae {1}, quod initianda:  `et viri pastores gregis' significat quod ducant 
ad bonum:  `quia viri pecoris sunt' significat quod illis bonum ex veris:  `et greges suos et armenta sua, et omnia quae illis, venire fecerunt' significat quod bonum interius et exterius, et quicquid 
inde est, praesens sit:  `et sit quod vocet vos Pharaoh' significat si conjungi velit naturale in quo scientifica Ecclesiae:  `et dicat, Quid opera vestra?' significat et scire vestra bona:  `et dicatis, 
Viri pecoris fuerunt servi tui a pueritiis suis, et usque ad nunc' significat quod vera ex quibus bonum illis a principio et adhuc: `etiam nos, etiam patres nostri' significat quod ita a primis 
bonis:  `propterea ut habitetis in terra Goshen' significat ita erit statio vestra in medio naturali ubi scientifica Ecclesiae:  `quia abominatio Aegyptiorum omnis pastor gregis' significat sic separationem 
a scientificis perversis quae opposita sunt scientificis Ecclesiae.  @1 A here only in naturali$ </p>
