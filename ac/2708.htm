<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2708节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2708.</strong>“住在旷野”表相对模糊之物。这从“住”和“旷野”的含义清楚可知：“住”是指生活（参看<a href="2451.htm">2451</a>节）；“旷野”是指拥有极少生命之物。（参看<a href="1927.htm">1927</a>节），此处是指相对模糊之物。相对属天教会的状态而言，属灵教会的状态就是相对模糊之物；或相对属天之人的状态而言，属灵之人的状态就是相对模糊之物。属天之人具有对良善的情感，属灵之人具有对真理的情感；属天之人拥有直觉，而属灵之人则拥有良知的指示；主向属天之人显为太阳，向属灵之人显为月亮（<a href="1521.htm">1521</a>，<a href="1530.htm">1530</a>，<a href="1531.htm">1531</a>，<a href="2495.htm">2495</a>节）。前者通过主所拥有的光既能使他们看见主的善与真，也能使他们觉察善与真。这光就像白天的日光；而后者通过主所拥有的光则像夜间的月光，因此，比起那些属天之人，这些人居于昏暗中。原因在于，属天之人具有对主之爱，因而具有主的生命本身；而属灵之人具有对邻之仁和信，诚然，他们也具有主的生命，但相对模糊。正因如此，属天之人从不推理信及其真理，因为他们通过良善处于对真理的直觉中，只是简单说“就是这样”；而属灵之人则谈论并推理信之真理，因为他们通过真理处于对良善的良知中。这种区别的另外一个原因是，对属天之人来说，爱之善被植入在其心智的意愿部分，人的主要生命就居于这意愿部分；而对属灵之人来说，爱之善则被植入在理解力部分，人的次要生命就居于理解力部分。这就是为何比起属天之人，属灵之人居于昏暗中的原因（参看<a href="81.htm">81</a>，<a href="202.htm">202</a>，<a href="337.htm">337</a>，<a href="765.htm">765</a>，<a href="784.htm">784</a>，<a href="895.htm">895</a>，<a href="1114.htm">1114</a>-<a href="1125.htm">1125</a>，<a href="1155.htm">1155</a>，<a href="1577.htm">1577</a>，<a href="1824.htm">1824</a>，<a href="2048.htm">2048</a>，<a href="2088.htm">2088</a>，<a href="2227.htm">2227</a>，<a href="2454.htm">2454</a>，<a href="2507.htm">2507</a>节）。<br />这种相对模糊性在此被称为“旷野”。在圣言中，“旷野”既表示少有人居住和耕种，也表示根本没人居住和耕种，因而具有双重意义。当表示少有人居住和耕种，也就是有少量居所、羊群、牧场和水的地方时，它表示相对来说那些拥有少量生命和光明之物或人，如相比属天之物或属天之人，属灵之物或属灵之人的情形。但当表示根本没人居住和耕种，也就是根本没有居所、羊群、牧场和水的地方时，它表示那些经历良善的消磨和真理的荒凉之人。<br />“旷野”表示相对来说少有人居住或耕种，或有少量居所、羊群、牧场和水的地方。这从以下经文明显看出来，以赛亚书：<br />航海的和海中所有的，海岛和其上的居民，都当向耶和华唱新歌，从地极赞美祂；愿旷野和其中的城邑，并基达人居住的村庄都当扬声；愿磐石的居民欢唱，愿他们在山顶上呐喊。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.10.htm">42:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.11.htm">11</a>）<br />以西结书：<br />我必与他们立平安的约，使恶兽从地上绝迹，他们就必在旷野安然居住，在林中安睡；我必使他们与我山冈的四围成为福源；田野的树必结果，地也必生出土产。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结34.25.htm">34:25</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结34.27.htm">27</a>）<br />此处论述的是属灵之人。何西阿书：<br />我必领她到旷野，和她谈心；从那里我必赐给她葡萄园。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何2.14.htm">2:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何2.15.htm">15</a>）<br />此处论述的是真理的荒凉，以及随后的安慰。诗篇：<br />旷野的草场滴落，小山以欢乐束腰；草场以羊群为衣，山谷也盖满了五谷。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗65.12.htm">65:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗65.13.htm">13</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />我要使旷野变为水池，使干地变为水泉。我要在旷野种上什亭的香柏树、桃金娘和橄榄树；我要在沙漠栽植杉树；好叫他们看见、知道、思想、明白，这是耶和华的手所做的，是以色列的圣者造了它。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛41.18.htm">41:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛41.20.htm">20</a>）<br />此处论述了那些对真理无知之人的重生，或外邦人，以及那些经历荒凉之人的启示和教导；“旷野”就论及这些人；“香柏树、桃金娘和橄榄树”表内层人的各种真理与良善；“杉树”表外层人的各种真理与良善。诗篇：<br />耶和华使江河变为旷野，叫水泉变为干旱之地；祂使旷野变为水池，叫旱地变为水泉。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗107.33.htm">107:33</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗107.35.htm">35</a>）<br />此处的意思也一样。以赛亚书：<br />旷野和干旱之地必因它们欢喜，沙漠也必快乐，又像玫瑰开花。必开花繁盛；在旷野必有水喷出，在沙漠必有溪河涌流。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛35.1.htm">35:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛35.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛35.6.htm">6</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />你必像浇灌的园子，又像水流不绝的水泉；那些出于你的人，必修造往日的旷野。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛58.11.htm">58:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛58.12.htm">12</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />等到圣灵从高处浇灌我们，旷野就变为迦密，迦密看如森林；公平要居在旷野，公义要居在迦密。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛32.15.htm">32:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛32.16.htm">16</a>）<br />此处论述的是属灵教会，尽管有人居住和耕种，但与属天教会相比，仍被称为“旷野”。因为经上说“公平要居在旷野，公义要居在迦密”。从这些经文明显可知，“旷野”表相对模糊的状态，因为它被称为“旷野”，还被称为“森林”；模糊的状态明显可见于耶利米书：<br />这世代的人哪，你们要看明耶和华的话。我岂向以色列作旷野呢？或作幽暗之地呢？（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.31.htm">2:31</a>）<br />“旷野”表示根本没人居住和耕种，也就是根本没有居所、羊群、牧场和水的地方，因而表示那些经历良善的消磨和真理的荒凉之人。这一点也可从圣言明显看出来。这种“旷野”以两种不同的含义来使用，也就是说，它可用来论及那些以后被改造之人，和那些无法被改造之人。关于那些以后被改造之人，如此处的夏甲和她儿子，我们在耶利米书中读到：<br />耶和华如此说，你幼年的恩爱，你在旷野，在未曾耕种之地跟随我，我都为你记着。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.2.htm">2:2</a>）<br />此处论述的是耶路撒冷，它在此表属灵的古教会。摩西书：<br />耶和华的分是祂的百姓；雅各是祂产业的顺位继承者；祂在沙漠之地，在咆哮、荒凉的旷野找到了他；祂引领他，叫他明白，保守他，如同保守眼中的瞳人。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.9.htm">32:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.10.htm">10</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />他们在旷野孤寂的路上漂流，寻不见可住的城邑。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗107.4.htm">107:4</a>）<br />此处论述的是那些经历真理的荒凉并正被改造的人。以西结书：<br />我必带你们到万民的旷野，我怎样在埃及地的旷野审判你们的列祖，也必照样在那里审判你们。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结20.35.htm">20:35</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结20.36.htm">36</a>）<br />此处同样论述了那些正被改造之人所经历的消磨和荒凉。<br />以色列人在旷野的旅程和漂泊无非代表那些有信之人在改造之前所经历的消磨和荒凉，因而代表他们的试探。因为当人们经历属灵的试探时，他们也经历消磨和荒凉。这一点也可从以下经文清楚看出来，摩西书：<br />在旷野，耶和华在你们所行的一切路上带领你们，如同人带领自己的儿子一样，直等你们来到这地方。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申1.31.htm">1:31</a>）<br /><br />你也要记念耶和华你的神在旷野一路引领你这四十年，是要苦炼你、试验你，要知道你心内如何，肯守祂的诫命不肯。祂苦炼你，任你饥饿，将你所不认识、你列祖也不认识的吗哪赐给你吃，使你知道人不是单靠食物活着，乃是靠耶和华口里所出的一切话活着。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申8.2.htm">8:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申8.3.htm">3</a>）<br />还有：<br />不要忘了，耶和华引你经过那大而可怕的旷野，那里有毒蛇、火蛇和蝎子；有干渴无水之地；祂曾给你从燧石而出的水；又在旷野将你列祖所不认识的吗哪赐给你吃，是要苦炼你、试验你，叫你终究得好处。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申8.15.htm">8:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申8.16.htm">16</a>）<br />此处“旷野”表消磨和荒凉，就是诸如那些处于试探之人所经历的那种。他们在旷野四十年的旅程和漂泊描述了教会争战的每一个状态，即当依靠自己时，它如何失败；而当依靠主时，它如何得胜。<br />在启示录，对“逃到旷野的妇人”的描述无非表示教会所经历的试探：那生了一个儿子，一个男孩子的妇人就逃到旷野，在那里有神给她预备的地方；有大鹰的两个翅膀赐给妇人，叫她能飞到旷野，到自己的地方；蛇就在妇人身后，从口中吐出水来，如一股洪水一样，要使她被洪水冲走。地却帮助妇人；地开了口，把龙从口中所吐出的洪水吞下去。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.6.htm">12:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.14.htm">14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.16.htm">16</a>）<br />“旷野”用来论及完全荒废的教会，和那些良善与真理完全荒废的人，他们无法被改造。这一点可见于以下经文，以赛亚书：<br />我使江河变为旷野，其中的鱼因无水腥臭，干渴而死；我使诸天以黑暗为衣服。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛50.2.htm">50:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛50.3.htm">3</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />你的圣城变为旷野，锡安变为旷野，耶路撒冷成为荒凉之处。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛64.10.htm">64:10</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />我观望，看，迦密变为旷野，她的一切城邑在耶和华面前都被拆毁。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.26.htm">4:26</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />许多牧人毁坏我的葡萄园，将我的分践踏在脚下，使我美好的分变为荒凉的旷野。他们使它成为荒凉之处，它既荒凉，便向我悲哀；全地荒凉，因无人把它放在心上。行毁灭的来到旷野一切的山坡上。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶12.10.htm">12:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶12.12.htm">12</a>）<br />约珥书：<br />火烧灭旷野的草场（folds）；火焰烧尽田野的树木。溪水干涸，火也烧灭旷野的草场（folds）。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥1.19.htm">1:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥1.20.htm">20</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />他使世界如同旷野，使其城邑倾覆。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.17.htm">14:17</a>）<br />这论及路西弗。同一先知书：<br />论海之旷野的预言。它从旷野，从可怕之地而来，好像南方的旋风。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛21.1.htm">21:1</a>）<br />“海之旷野”表被记忆知识所荒废的真理和基于它们的推理。<br />由此可见以下论及施洗约翰的经文表示什么：<br />这就是以赛亚书所说的，在旷野有人声呼喊着：预备主的道，修直祂的路。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太3.3.htm">3:3</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可1.3.htm">1:3</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路3.4.htm">3:4</a>；约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.23.htm">1:23</a>；以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.3.htm">40:3</a>）<br />这些话的意思是：那时，教会完全荒废，以致再没有任何良善与真理存留。这一点从以下事实非常明显地看出来：即那时，没人知道人有内在之物，或圣言有内在之物，因此没人知道弥赛亚或基督要来永远拯救他们。上述经文也表明以下这些经文表示什么：约翰在旷野，直到他显明给以色列人的日子（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.80.htm">1:80</a>）；他在犹太的旷野传道（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太3.1.htm">3:1</a>等）；他在旷野施洗（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可1.4.htm">1:4</a>）。因为他也代表教会的状态。从“旷野”的含义也可以看出，主为何经常退到旷野（如马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太4.1.htm">4:1</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太15.32.htm">15:32</a>到末尾；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可1.12.htm">1:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可1.13.htm">13</a>，<a

href="http://39-27.cn/约11.54.htm">11:54</a>）。从“山”的含义也明显看出主为何退到山上（如马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太14.23.htm">14:23</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太15.29.htm">15:29</a>-<a

And he dwelt in the wilderness. That this signifies in what is relatively obscure, is evident from the signification of "dwelling," as being to live (see n. 2451); and from the signification of "wilderness," 
as being that which has little vitality (see n. 1927); here what is obscure, but relatively. By what is relatively obscure is meant the state of the spiritual church relatively to the state of 
the celestial church, or the state of those who are spiritual relatively to that of those who are celestial. The celestial are in the affection of good, the spiritual in the affection of truth; the 
celestial have perception, but the spiritual a dictate of conscience; to the celestial the Lord appears as a Sun, but to the spiritual as a Moon (n. 1521, 1530, 1531, 2495). The former have light from 
the Lord, but giving both sight and the perception of good and truth, like the light of day from the sun; but the latter have light from the Lord like the light of night from the moon, and thus they 
are in relative obscurity. The reason is that the celestial are in love to the Lord, and thus in the Lord's life itself; but the spiritual are in charity toward the neighbor and in faith, and thus in 
the Lord's life indeed, but more obscurely. Hence it is that the celestial never reason about faith and its truths, but being in perception of truth from good, they say that it is so; whereas the spiritual 
speak and reason concerning the truths of faith, because they are in the conscience of good from truth; and also because with the celestial the good of love has been implanted in their will part, 
wherein is the chief life of man, but with the spiritual in their intellectual part, wherein is the secondary life of man; this is the reason why the spiritual are in what is relatively obscure (see 
n. 81, 202, 337, 765, 784, 895, 1114-1125, 1155, 1577, 1824, 2048, 2088, 2227, 2454, 2507). [2] This comparative obscurity is here called a "wilderness." In the Word a "wilderness" signifies what is 
little inhabited and cultivated, and also signifies what is not at all inhabited and cultivated, and is thus used in a twofold sense. Where it signifies what is little inhabited and cultivated, or where 
there are few habitations, folds of flocks, pastures, and waters, it signifies what has relatively little life and light-as what is spiritual, or those who are spiritual, in comparison with what is 
celestial, or those who are celestial. But where it signifies what is not inhabited or cultivated at all, or where there are no habitations, folds of flocks, pastures, or waters, it signifies those 
who are in vastation as to good and in desolation as to truth. [3] That a "wilderness" signifies what is comparatively little inhabited and cultivated, or where there are few habitations, folds of flocks, 
pastures, and waters, is evident from the following passages. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Sing unto Jehovah a new song and His praise from the end of the earth; ye that go down to the sea, and the fullness 
thereof, the isles and the inhabitants thereof; let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up, the villages* that Kedar doth inhabit; let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the 
top of the mountains (Isa. 42:10-11). In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil wild beast to cease out of the land, and they shall dwell securely in the wilderness, 
and sleep in the woods; and I will make them and the places round about My hill a blessing; the tree of the field shall yield its fruit, and the earth shall yield her fruit (Ezek. 34:25-27); </p>
<p>here 
the spiritual are treated of. In Hosea: </p>
<p>     I will bring her into the wilderness, and will speak to her heart; and I will give her her vineyards from thence (Hos. 2:14-15); </p>
<p>where the desolation 
of truth, and consolation afterwards, are treated of. In David: </p>
<p>     The folds of the wilderness do drop, and the hills are girded with rejoicing; the pastures are clothed with flocks, the valleys 
also are covered over with corn (Ps. 65:12-13). [4] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     I will make the wilderness a pool of waters, and the dry land springs of waters. I will plant in the wilderness the cedar of Shittim, 
and the myrtle, and the oil-tree; I will set in the desert the fir-tree; that they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of Jehovah hath done this, and the Holy 
One of Israel hath created it (Isa. 41:18-20); </p>
<p>where the regeneration of those who are in ignorance of truth, or the Gentiles, and the enlightenment and instruction of those who are in desolation, 
are treated of; the "wilderness" is predicated of these; the "cedar, myrtle, and oil-tree" denote the truths and goods of the interior man; the "fir-tree" denotes those of the exterior. In David: </p>
<p>   
  Jehovah maketh rivers into a wilderness, and watersprings into dry ground; He maketh a wilderness into a pool of waters, and a dry land into watersprings (Ps. 107:33, 35); </p>
<p>where the meaning is the 
same. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The wilderness and the parched land shall be glad for them, and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose; budding it shall bud; in the wilderness shall waters break out,** 
and streams in the desert (Isa. 35:1-2, 6). In the same: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water whose waters do not fail; and they that be of thee shall build the deserts 
of old (Isa. 58:11-12). In the same: </p>
<p>     Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness become Carmel, and Carmel be counted for a forest; and judgment shall dwell in the 
wilderness, and righteousness in Carmel (Isa. 32:15-16); </p>
<p>where the spiritual church is treated of, which though inhabited and cultivated is called relatively a "wilderness;" for it is said, "judgment 
shall dwell in the wilderness and righteousness in Carmel." That a "wilderness" denotes a comparatively obscure state, is plain from these passages by its being called a "wilderness" and also a "forest;" 
and very evidently so in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     O generation, see ye the Word of Jehovah. Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? or a land of darkness? (Jer. 2:31). [5] That a "wilderness" signifies what 
is not at all inhabited or cultivated, or where there are no habitations, folds of flocks, pastures, and waters, and thus those who are in vastation as to good and in desolation as to truth, is also 
evident from the Word. This kind of "wilderness" is predicated in a double sense, namely, of those who are afterwards reformed, and of those who cannot be reformed. Concerning those who are afterwards 
reformed (as here in regard to Hagar and her son) we read in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Thus saith Jehovah, I remember for thee the mercy of thy youth, thy going after Me in the wilderness, in a land that was 
not sown (Jer. 2:2); </p>
<p>where Jerusalem is treated of, which here is the Ancient Church that was spiritual. In Moses: </p>
<p>     Jehovah's portion is His people, Jacob is the line of His inheritance; He found 
him in a desert land, and in a waste howling wilderness; He led him about, He made him understand, He kept him as the pupil of His eye (Deut. 32:9-10). In David: </p>
<p>     They wandered in the wilderness 
in a solitary way, they found no city of habitation (Ps. 107:4); </p>
<p>where those who have been in desolation of truth and are being reformed are treated of. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     I will bring you to the 
wilderness of the peoples, and I will judge with you there, as I judged with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt (Ezek. 20:35-36); </p>
<p>where in like manner the vastation and desolation of 
those who are being reformed are treated of. [6] The journeyings and wanderings of the people of Israel in the wilderness represented nothing but the vastation and desolation of believers before reformation; 
consequently their temptation, if indeed they are in vastation and desolation when they are in spiritual temptations; as may also be seen from the following passages in Moses: </p>
<p>     Jehovah 
bare them in the wilderness as a man beareth his son, in the way, even unto this place (Deut. 1:31). And in another place: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt remember all the way which Jehovah thy God led thee these 
forty years in the wilderness, to afflict thee, to tempt thee, and to know what is in thy heart; whether thou wouldest keep His commandments or no. He afflicted thee, He suffered thee to hunger, He made 
thee to eat manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that thou mightiest know that man doth not live by bread only, but by everything that proceedeth out of the mouth of Jehovah 
doth man live (Deut. 8:2-3). And again in the same chapter: </p>
<p>     Lest thou forget that Jehovah led thee in the great and terrible wilderness, where were serpents, fiery serpents, and scorpions; a thirsty 
land where was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint; He fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that He might afflict thee, and might tempt 
thee, to do thee good at thy latter end (Deut. 8:15-16). Here the "wilderness" denotes vastation and desolation, such as those are in who are in temptations. By their journeyings and wanderings in the 
wilderness forty years, all the state of the combating church is described-how of itself it yields, but conquers from the Lord. [7] By the "woman who fled into the wilderness," in John, nothing else 
is signified than the temptation of the church, thus described: </p>
<p>     The woman who brought forth a son, a man child, fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God; there were given 
unto the woman two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place; and the serpent cast out of his mouth after the woman water as a flood, that he might cause her to 
be carried away of the flood. But the earth helped the woman; for the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth (Rev. 12:6, 14-16). [8] That "wilderness" 
is predicated of a church altogether vastated, and of those who are altogether vastated as to good and truth, who cannot be reformed, is thus shown in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     I make the rivers a wilderness; 
their fish stink because there is no water, and die for thirst; I clothe the heavens with thick darkness (Isa. 50:2-3). In the same: </p>
<p>     Thy holy cities were become a wilderness, Zion was become 
a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation (Isa. 64:10). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     I beheld and lo Carmel was a wilderness, and all her cities were broken down at the presence of Jehovah (Jer. 4:26). In the same: </p>
<p> 
    Many shepherds have destroyed My vineyard, they have trodden My portion under foot; they have made My pleasant portion a wilderness of desolation, they have made it a desolation, it hath mourned 
unto Me, being desolate; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to heart. Spoilers are come upon all the hillsides in the wilderness (Jer. 12:10-12). In Joel: </p>
<p>     The fire hath 
devoured the folds of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field, the water brooks are dried up, the fire hath devoured the folds of the wilderness (Joel 1:19-20). In Isaiah: </p>
<p> 
    He made the world as a wilderness, and overthrew the cities thereof (Isa. 14:17); </p>
<p>where Lucifer is spoken of. In the same: </p>
<p>     The prophecy of the wilderness of the sea. As whirlwinds in 
the south, it cometh from the wilderness, from a terrible land (Isa. 21:1 seq.). The "wilderness of the sea" denotes truth vastated by memory-knowledges and the reasonings from them. [9] From all this 
it may be seen what is signified by the following concerning John the Baptist: </p>
<p>     It was said by Isaiah, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way for the Lord, make His paths 
straight (Matt. 3:3; Mark 1:3; Luke 3:4; John 1:23; Isa. 40:3); </p>
<p>which means that the church was then altogether vastated, so that there was no longer any good, nor any truth; which is plainly manifest 
from the fact, that then no one knew that man had any internal, nor that there was any internal in the Word, and thus that no one knew that the Messiah or Christ was to come to eternally save them. 
Hence it is also manifest what is signified by John being in the wilderness until the days of his appearing to Israel (Luke 1:80); and by his preaching in the wilderness of Judea (Matt. 3:1, and following 
verses); and by his baptizing in the wilderness (Mark 1:4); for by that he also represented the state of the church. From the signification of a "wilderness" it may also be seen why the Lord so 
often withdrew into the wilderness (see for examples Matt. 4:1; 15:32 to the end; Mark 1:12-13, 35-40, 45; 6:31-36; Luke 4:1; 5:16; 9:10 and following verses; John 11:54). From the signification of a 
"mountain" also it is manifest why the Lord withdrew into the mountains (as in Matt. 14:23; 15:29-31; 17:1 and following verses; 28:16-17; Mark 3:13-14; 6:46; 9:2-9; Luke 6:12-13; 9:28; John 6:15). *

'And dwelt in the wilderness' means that which is obscure comparatively. This is clear from the meaning of 'dwelling' as living, dealt with in <a href="2451.htm">2451</a>, and from the meaning of 'a wilderness' as that which 
possesses little life, dealt with in <a href="1927.htm">1927</a>, here as that which is obscure comparatively. By that which is obscure comparatively is meant the state of the spiritual Church in comparison with the state 
of the celestial Church, that is, the state of those who are spiritual in comparison with the state of those who are celestial. Those who are celestial are moved by the affection for good, those who 
are spiritual by the affection for truth. Those who are celestial possess perception, whereas those who are spiritual possess the dictate of conscience. To those who are celestial the Lord appears as 
a Sun, but to those who are spiritual as a Moon, <a href="1521.htm">1521</a>, <a href="1530.htm">1530</a>, <a href="1531.htm">1531</a>, <a href="2495.htm">2495</a>. The light which the former have - enabling them to see good and truth from the Lord with their eyes as well as to perceive it 
- is like the light of the sun in the daytime; but the light which the latter have from the Lord is like the light of the moon at night, and so, compared with those who are celestial, these dwell in obscurity. 
The reason for this is that those who are celestial dwell in love to the Lord, and so in the Lord's life itself, whereas those who are spiritual dwell in charity towards the neighbour and in 
faith, and so, it is true, in the Lord's life but in a rather more obscure way. All this explains why those who are celestial never reason about faith or the truths of faith, but because a perception 
of truth from good exists with them, simply say, 'That is so', whereas those who are spiritual talk and reason about the truths of faith because a conscience for what is good received from truth exists 
with them. A further reason for this difference is that with those who are celestial the good of love has been implanted in the will part of their minds, where man's chief life resides, but with those 
who are spiritual it has been implanted in the understanding part, where man's secondary life resides. This is the reason why, compared with the celestial, the spiritual dwell in obscurity, see <a href="81.htm">81</a>, <a href="202.htm">202</a>, <a href="337.htm">337</a>, <a href="765.htm">765</a>, <a href="784.htm">784</a>, <a href="895.htm">895</a>, <a href="1114.htm">1114</a>-<a href="1125.htm">1125</a>, <a href="1155.htm">1155</a>, <a href="1577.htm">1577</a>, <a href="1824.htm">1824</a>, <a href="2048.htm">2048</a>, <a href="2088.htm">2088</a>, <a href="2227.htm">2227</a>, <a href="2454.htm">2454</a>, <a href="2507.htm">2507</a>.

<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the Word 'a wilderness' can mean that which is 
sparsely inhabited and cultivated, or it can mean that which is totally uninhabited and uncultivated, and so is used in two senses. When it means that which is sparsely inhabited and cultivated, that 
is, where there are few dwellings, and where there are sheepfolds, pastures, and waters, it means that thing or those persons who, compared with others, have little life and light, as is the case with 
that which is spiritual or those who are spiritual in comparison with that which is celestial or those who are celestial. When however it means that which is totally uninhabited and uncultivated, that 
is, where there are no dwellings, sheepfolds, pastures, and waters, it means those who have undergone vastation as regards good and desolation as regards truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That 'a wilderness' can mean 
that which, compared with other places, is sparsely inhabited and cultivated, that is, where there are few dwellings, and where there are sheepfolds, pastures, and waters, is clear from the following 
places: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Sing to Jehovah a new song, His praise from the end of the earth, those that go down to the sea, and the fullness of it, the islands and their inhabitants. The wilderness and its 
cities will lift up [their voice]; Kedar will inhabit the settlements,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> the inhabitants of the rock will sing, they will shout from the top of the mountains. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2042:%2010,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 42: 10, 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
I will 
make with them a covenant of peace and I will banish the evil wild animal from the land, and they will dwell securely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods, and I will give them and the places around 
My hill a blessing. The tree of the field will give its fruit, and the earth will give its increase.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2034:%2025-27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 34: 25-27</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to those who are spiritual. In Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
I will bring her into 
the wilderness and will speak tenderly to her; and I will give her her vineyards from it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%202:-14,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 2:-14, 15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the desolation of truth and to the comfort that follows later. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In 
David, </p>
<blockquote>
The folds of the wilderness drip, and the hills gird themselves with rejoicing; the meadows clothe themselves with flocks, and the valleys are covered over with grain. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2065:%2012,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 65: 12, 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In 
Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will make the wilderness into a pool of water, and the parched land into streams of water. I will put in the wilderness the shittim-cedar, and the myrtle, and the oil tree. I will set in 
the wilderness the fir, that men may see and know, and may consider and understand together, for the hand of Jehovah has done this, and the Holy One of Israel has created it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2041:%2018-20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 41: 18-20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers 
to the regeneration of those who have no knowledge of the truth, that is, gentiles, and to the enlightenment and teaching of those who have experienced desolation. 'The wilderness' is used in reference 
to these. 'The cedar, the myrtle, and the oil tree' stands for the truths and goods of the interior man, 'fir' for those of the exterior man. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah turns rivers into a wilderness, 
and streams of waters into dryness. He turns a wilderness into a pool of water, and parched land into streams of water. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20107:%2033,%2035&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 107: 33, 35</a> 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the meaning is similar. In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The wilderness 
and the dry land will be glad for them, and the lonely place will rejoice and blossom like the rose. It will bud prolifically. Waters will break forth in the wilderness, and streams in the lonely place. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2035:%201,%202,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 35: 1, 2, 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<p>You will be like a watered garden and like a spring of waters whose waters do not fail; and those that be of you will build the wilderness of old. Isa. 
58: <a href="11.htm">11</a>, <a href="12.htm">12</a>. </p>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Until the spirit is poured out on us from on high, and the wilderness will become Carmel, and Carmel counted as a forest. And judgement will dwell in the wilderness 
and righteousness on Carmel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2032:%2015,%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 32: 15, 16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the spiritual Church which, though inhabited and cultivated, is, in comparison [with the celestial Church], called 'a wilderness', for 
it is said that 'judgement will dwell in the wilderness and righteousness on Carmel'. It is evident from the places just quoted that 'a wilderness' means an obscure state compared with other states 
not only because it is described as 'a wilderness' but also as 'a woodland'; and an obscure state is plainly the meaning in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
O generation, observe the word of Jehovah. Have I been a wilderness 
to Israel, or a land of darkness? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%202:%2031&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 2: 31</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 That 'a wilderness' can mean that which is totally uninhabited and uncultivated, that is, where there are no dwellings, sheepfolds, pastures, 
and waters, and so can mean those who have experienced vastation as regards good and desolation as regards truth, is also clear from the Word. This kind of wilderness is used with two different meanings; 
that is to say, it may be used in reference to those who are subsequently reformed or in reference to those who are unable to be reformed. Regarding those who are subsequently reformed, such as Hagar 
and her son represent here, it is said in Jeremiah, </p>
<p>Thus said Jehovah, I have remembered you, the mercy of the days of your youth, your going after Me in the wilderness, in a land not sown. Jer. 
2: <a href="2.htm">2</a>. </p>
<p>This refers to Jerusalem, which in this case means the Ancient Church that was spiritual. In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
The portion of Jehovah is His people, Jacob is the line of His inheritance. He found 
him in a wilderness land and in the waste, the howling, the lonely place. He encompassed him, led him to understand, and kept him as the pupil of His eye. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2032:%209,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 32: 9, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In David, </p>
<blockquote>
They wandered 
in the wilderness, in a desolate way; they did not find an inhabited city. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20107:%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 107: 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to those who have experienced desolation of truth and are being reformed. In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
I will 
bring you to the wilderness of the peoples and I will enter into judgement with you there, as I entered into judgement with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2020:%2035,%2036&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 20: 35, 36</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This 
likewise refers to the vastation and desolation of those who are being reformed. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 The travels and wanderings of the Israelites in the wilderness represented nothing else than the vastation and 
desolation prior to reformation of those who have faith. It consequently represented the temptation of them, for when people undergo spiritual temptations they experience vastation and desolation, as 
may also become clear from the following in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah carried you<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> along in the wilderness, as a man carries his son, in [all] the way [you went], until [you reached] this place. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%201:&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 1:</a> 
<a href="31.htm">31</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere in the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
You shall remember all the way in which Jehovah your God has led you forty years already in the wilderness to afflict you, to tempt you, and to know what is in 
your heart, whether you will keep His commandments or not. He afflicted you, caused you to hunger, caused you to eat manna which you do not know nor your fathers knew, so that you may recognize that 
man does not live by bread only but that man lives by all that goes out of the mouth of Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%208:%202,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 8: 2, 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And further on in the same chapter, </p>
<blockquote>
Do not forget that Jehovah led you in the great 
and terrible wilderness where there were serpents, fiery snakes, and scorpions, parched places where there was no water, and that He brought you water out of the rock of flint. He fed you in the wilderness 
with manna which your fathers did not know, that He might afflict you, tempt you, to do you good in the end. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%208:%2015,%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 8: 15, 16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'wilderness' stands for the vastation and desolation such 
as people experience who undergo temptations. Their travels and wanderings in the wilderness for forty years describe every state of the Church militant - how when it is self-reliant it goes under but 
when it relies on the Lord it overcomes. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 The description in John of the woman who fled into the wilderness means nothing else than temptation experienced by the Church, referred to as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
The 
woman who brought forth the male child fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God. To the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly into the wilderness, 
into her own place. And the serpent poured water like a stream out of his mouth after the woman, to swallow her up in the river. But the earth helped the woman, for the earth opened its mouth 
and swallowed the stream which the dragon poured out of his mouth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2012:%206,%2014-16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 12: 6, 14-16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 That 'a wilderness' may be used in reference to a totally vastated Church and to people totally vastated as 
regards good and truth who are unable to be reformed may be seen in the following in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will make the rivers a wilderness; their fish will stink for lack of water and will die of thirst; I 
will clothe the heavens with thick darkness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2050:%202,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 50: 2, 3</a>.

<p>'The wilderness of the sea' stands for truth that has been vastated by facts and by reasonings based on these. </p>

<p>These words imply that at that time the Church was so totally vastated that no good and no truth remained any longer. This is quite evident from the fact that nobody at that 
time knew of the existence in man of anything internal, or of anything internal in the Word, so that nobody knew that the Messiah or Christ was coming to save them for ever. The places quoted above 
also show what is meant by the statement that John was in the wilderness until the time of his manifestation to Israel, Luke l: <a href="80.htm">80</a>, that he preached in the wilderness of Judea, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%203:%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 3: 1</a> and following

`Et habitavit in deserto':  quod significet obscurum respective, constat a significatione `habitare' quod sit vivere, de qua n. 2451; et a significatione `deserti' quod sit parum vitale, de qua n. 1927, 
hic obscurum sed respective; per obscurum respective intelligitur status spiritualis Ecclesiae respective ad statum caelestis Ecclesiae, seu status {1} spiritualium respective ad statum caelestium; 
caelestes sunt in affectione boni, spirituales in affectione veri; caelestes perceptionem habent, spirituales vero dictamen conscientiae; caelestibus apparet Dominus ut sol, spiritualibus vero ut luna, 
n. 1521, 1530 {2}, 1531, 2495, illis lux sicut visualis etiam perceptiva boni et veri a Domino est sicut lux diei a sole, at lux his a Domino est sicut lux noctis a luna, ita est his obscurum respective; 
causa est quia caelestes sunt in amore in Dominum, ita in ipsa vita Domini, spirituales vero in charitate erga proximum et in fide, ita quidem in vita Domini, sed obscurius; inde est quod caelestes 
nusquam ratiocinentur de fide et ejus veris, sed quia in perceptione veri a bono sunt, dicunt quod ita sit; spirituales autem loquuntur et ratiocinantur de veris fidei, quia in conscientia boni 
sunt a vero; tum quia caelestibus implantatum est bonum amoris in parte eorum voluntaria, ubi est principalis vita hominis; at spiritualibus in parte eorum intellectuali, ubi est secundaria vita hominis; 
inde causa quod spiritualibus obscurum [sit] respective, videatur n. 81, 202, 337, 765, 784, 895, 1114-1125, 1155, 1577, 1824, 2048, 2088, 2227, 2454, 2507 {3}; hoc obscurum respective vocatur hic 
`desertum': [2] `desertum' in Verbo' significat parum habitatum et excultum, et significat prorsus non habitatum et excultum, ita in duplici sensu; ubi significat parum habitatum et excultum, seu ubi 
paucae habitationes, ubi caulae gregum, pascua et aquae, significat illud vel illos qui parum vitae et lucis respective habent, sicut spirituale seu spirituales respective ad caeleste seu caelestes; 
ubi autem significat prorsus non habitatum seu {4} excultum seu ubi nullae habitationes, caulae gregum, pascua et aquae, significat illos qui in vastatione quoad bonum sunt et in desolatione quoad verum. 
 [3] Quod `desertum' significet parum habitatum et excultum respective, seu ubi paucae habitationes, ubi causae gregum, pascua et aquae, constat ab his locis, apud Esaiam, 	Cantate Jehovae canticum 
novum; laus Ipsius ab 	extremo terrae, descendentes mare, et plenitudo ejus, insulae et habitatores earum; attollent {5} desertum et urbes ejus; atria habitabit Kedar, cantabunt habitatores petrae, 
de capite montium clamabunt, xlii 10, 11: </p>
<p>apud Ezechielem, 	Pangam iis foedus pacis, et cessare faciam feram malam de terra, et habitabunt in deserto confidenter, et dormient in silvis et dabo eas, 
et circuitus collis Mei benedictionem,... dabit arbor agri fructum suum, et terra dabit fructum suum, xxxiv 25-27; </p>
<p>ibi de spiritualibus: apud Hosheam, 	Ducam eam in desertum, et loquar super cor ejus, 
et dabo ei vineas suas inde, ii 14, 15; </p>
<p>[4] ubi de desolatione veri et postea consolatione: apud Davidem,  	Stillant caulae deserti, et exsultatione colles cingunt se, induunt prata, gregem, et 
valles operiuntur frumento, Ps. lxv 13, 14: [A.V. 12, 13]: </p>
<p>apud Esaiam, 	Ponam desertum in lacum aquarum, et terram siticulosam in exitus aquarum; dabo in deserto cedrum shittim, et myrtum, et {6} 
arborem olei: ponam in deserto abietem; ut videant et sciant, et reponant, et intelligant una, quia manus Jehovae fecit hoc, Sanctus Israelis creavit illud, xii 18-20; </p>
<p>ubi de regeneratione illorum qui 
in ignorantia veri (o)sunt, seu gentium, et de illustratione et instructione eorum qui in desolatione; `desertum' praedicatur de illis; `cedrus, myrtus et arbor olei' pro veris et bonis interioris hominis, 
`abies' pro exterioris: apud Davidem, 	Jehovah ponit fluvios in desertum, et exitus aquarum siccitatem: ponit desertum in lacum aquarum, et terram siticulosam in exitus aquarum, Ps. cvii 33, 
35; </p>
<p>similiter: apud Esaiam, 	Gaudebunt eis, desertum et siccitas, et exsultabit solitudo, et florebit sicut rosa, germinando germinabit:... effusae sunt deserto aquae, et flumina in solitudine, xxxv 
	1, 2, 6; </p>
<p>(m)apud eundem, 	Eris velut hortus irriguus, et sicut exitus aquarum, cui non mentiuntur aquae, et aedificabunt a te deserta saeculi, lviii 11, 12; </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Donec effundatur super 
nos spiritus ab alto, et erit deserti in Carmel, et Carmel in silvam reputabitur; et habitabit in deserto judicium, et justitia in Carmele, xxxii 15, 16; </p>
<p>ubi de Ecclesia spirituali, quae quamvis habitata 
et exculta, vocat `desertum' respective, nam dicitur `habitabit in deserto judicium, justitia in Carmele.'  Quod `desertum' sit obscurus status respective, ex locis illis patet quod appelletur desertum, 
tum quoque silva: manifeste apud Jeremiam, 	Generatio, vos videte verbum Jehovae, num desertum fui Israeli, num terra terrarum, ii 31. [5] Quod `desertum' significet prorsus non habitatum seu 
{7} excultum, seu ubi nullae habitationes, caulae gregum, pascua, et aquae, ita illos qui in vastatione quoad bonum sunt, et in desolatione quoad verum, constat quoque a Verbo; hoc {8} desertum praedicatur 
in duplici sensu, nempe de illis qui postea reformantur, et de illis qui reformari non possunt; de illis qui postea reformantur, ut hic de Hagare et ejus filio, apud Jeremiam, 	Sic dixit Jehovah, 
Recordatus sum tui, misericordiae pueritiarum tuarum,... eundo post Me in deserto, in terra non sata, ii 2; </p>
<p>ubi de Hierosolyma, quae ibi est Antiqua Ecclesia quae fuit spiritualis: apud Mosen, 	Portio 
Jehovae populus Ipsius, Jacob funis hereditatis Ipsius; invenit eum in terra deserti, et in vastitate, ejulatu, solitudine, circumduxit eum, intelligere fecit eum, custodivit eum ut pupillam oculi 
Sui, Deut. xxxii 9, 10: </p>
<p>apud Davidem, 	Errarunt in deserto, in solitudine viae, urbem habitationis non invenerunt, Ps. cvii 4; </p>
<p>ubi de illis qui in desolatione veri, (c)et reformantur: apud Ezechielem, 	Adducam 
vos ad desertum populum, et judicabo vobiscum ibi... sicut judicavi cum patribus vestris in deserto terrae Aegypti, xx 35, 36; </p>
<p>ubi pariter de vastatione et desolatione eorum qui reformantur. 
[6] Profectiones et errores populi Israelitici in deserto nec aliud repraesentabant quam vastationem et desolationem fidelium ante reformationem, proinde eorum tentationem {9}, siquidem cum 
in tentationibus spiritualibus sunt, in vastatione et desolatione sunt, ut quoque constare potest ab his apud Mosen, 	Jehovah in deserto portavit eos, sicut portat vir filium, in via, usque ad hunc 
locum, Deut. i 31: </p>
<p>et alibi, 	Recorderis omnis viae, qua {10} duxit te Jehovah Deus tuus jam quadraginta annis in deserto, ad affligendum te, ad tentandum te, et sciendum quid in corde tuo, an serves	praecepta 
Ipsius vel non, afflixit te, esurire fecit te, edere fecit te mannam, quam non nosti, nec norunt patres; ut cognoscas, quod non per panem solum vivat homo, sed per omne quod exit ex ore Jehovae 
vivat homo, Deut. viii 2, 3: </p>
<p>et adhuc, 	Ne obliviscaris quod Jehovah duxerit te in deserto magno terribili, ubi serpens, prester, et scorpio; siticulosum ubi {11} non aqua, educens tibi aquam 
e petra silicis; cibavit te manna deserto, quam non noverunt patres tui, ut affligeret te, tentaret te, et ad benefaciendum in postremo tuo, ibid. vers. 15, 16; </p>
<p>ibi `desertum' pro vastatione et desolatione 
in quali sunt qui tentationibus; per `profectiones et errores eorum in deserto quadraginta annis' describitur omnis status Ecclesiae pugnantis, quomodo a se succumbit, sed a Domino vincit.  [7] 
Per `mulierem quae fugit in desertum' apud Johannem, nec aliud quam tentatio Ecclesiae significatur, de qua ita, 	Mulier, quae peperit filium masculum, fugit in desertum, ubi habet locum praeparatum 
a Deo:... datae sunt mulieri duae alae aquilae magnae, ut volaret in desertum, in locum suum; ejecit serpens post mulierem ex ore suo aquam sicut fluvium ut hanc a flumine absorptam faceret, sed adjuvit 
terra mulierem; aperuit enim terra os suum, et	deglutivit fluvium, quem ejecit draco ex ore suo, Apoc. xii 	6, 14-16. [8] Quod desertum praedicetur de prorsus vastata Ecclesia, et de prorsus vastatis 
quoad bonum et verum, qui (t)non reformari possunt, ita apud Esaiam, 	Ponam flumina desertum, fetebit piscis eorum a nulla aqua et morietur in siti, induam caelos caligine, l 2, 3: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Civitates 
sanctitatis Tuae fuerunt desertum, Zion desertum fuit, Hierosolyma desolata, lxiv 9 [A.V. 10]; </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam, 	Vidi et ecce Carmel desertum, et omnes urbes ejus destructae sunt a coram 
Jehovah, iv 26: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Pastores multi corruperunt vineam Meam, conculcarunt portionem, dederunt portionem desiderii Mei in desertum desolationis. Posuit eam in desolationem, luxit super Me desolata; 
desolata est omnis terra, quia non quisquam ponit super cor super omnes clivos in deserto venerunt vastatores, xii 10-12: </p>
<p>apud Joelem, 	Ignis consumpsit caulas deserti, et flamma succendet 	omnes 
arbores agri,... exsiccati sunt rivi aquarum, et ignis 	consumpsit caulas deserti, i 19, 20: </p>
<p>apud Esaiam, 	Posuit orbem sicut desertum, et urbes ejus destruxit, xiv 17; </p>
<p>ubi de Lucifero: apud 
eundem, 	Propheticum deserti maris, sicut procellae in meridie,... e deserto venit, e terra terribili, xxi i seq.; </p>
<p>`desertum maris' pro vastato vero per scientifica, et ratiocinia inde.  [9] Ex illis 
constare potest quid significatur per haec quae de Johanne Baptista, 	Dictum ab Esaia, Vox clamantis in deserto, Parate viam Domino, rectas facite semitas Ipsius, Matth. iii 3; Marc. i 3; Luc. iii 
4; Joh. i 23; Esai. xi 3; </p>
<p>quod nempe tunc Ecclesia prorsus vastata esset, ut non amplius aliquod bonum et aliquod verum; quod manifeste patet ex eo quod tunc nullus sciret quod aliquid internum homini 
esset, nec quod aliquid internum in Verbo; ita nec quod Messias seu Christus venturus ad salvandum eos in aeternum: inde etiam patet quid significatur per quod 	Johannes fuerit in desertis usque ad 
dies apparitionis illius ad Israelem, Luc. 1, 80; </p>
<p>et quod `praedicaverit in deserto Judaeae,' Matth. iii 1; seq.; et quod `in deserto baptizaverit,' Marc. i 4; per id enim repraesentabat etiam ille 
statum Ecclesiae. A significatione `deserti' etiam constare potest cur Dominus toties `secessit in desertum,' ut Matth. iv 1; xv 32 ad fin.; Marc. i 12, 13, (x)35, 45; vi 31-36; Luc. iv 1; v 16; ix 10 
seq.; Joh. xi 54; tum a significatione `montis,' cur Dominus in montes, ut Matth. xiv 23; xv 29-31; xvii 1 seq.; xxviii 16, 17; Marc. iii 13, 14; vi 46; ix 2-9, Luc. vi 12, 13; ix 18, Joh. vi 15. 	@1
