<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6288节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6288.</strong>“这在他眼里不对”表不悦。这是显而易见的，无需解释。约瑟之所以不悦，是因为他所代表的内在属天层在“以色列”所代表的属灵良善之上。高层事物能觉察到低层事物所行之事的性质，因而也能觉察到那里所思想的东西是不是真理。因为高层事物因凭天堂之光看见，故能看见下面的事物。因此，内在属天层，就是“约瑟”能看见来自属世层的属灵良善，就是“以色列”，在犯错；所以这让他感到不悦。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6288</b></p><p><b>6288.</b>
And it was evil in his eyes. That this signifies displeasure, is evident without explication. The reason why it displeased Joseph was that by him is represented the internal celestial, which is above 
the spiritual good that is represented by Israel. What is higher can perceive how the case is with what is done in what is lower, thus also whether it is truth that is being thought there, or not. For 
as what is higher sees from the light of heaven, it sees the things that are below; thus the internal celestial which is "Joseph," saw that the spiritual good from the natural which is "Israel," was 
in error, and therefore it displeased him. </p>

'And it was wrong in his eyes' means displeasure. This is clear without explanation. The reason Joseph was displeased was that he represents the internal celestial, which is above the spiritual good 
that 'Israel' represents. What is higher can discern the nature of anything done in what is lower, and so can also discern whether or not any thought there is the truth. For what is higher can see whatever 
exists in lower parts because it does so in the light of heaven. Thus it was that the internal celestial, which is 'Joseph', could see that spiritual good from the natural, which is 'Israel', was 
making a mistake; therefore it displeased him. </p>

</p><b>6288.</b>
`Et malum fuit in oculis ejus':  quod significet displicentiam, constat absque explicatione.  Quod displicuerit Josepho, erat quia per (c)eum repraesentatur caeleste internum, quod est supra bonum spirituale 
quod repraesentatur per `Israelem'; quod superius est, hoc potest appercipere quomodo se habet cum {1}eo quod agitur in inferiore, ita quoque num verum sit quod ibi cogitatur, vel non; superius 
enim videt quae in inferioribus sunt, quia e luce caeli; ita vidit caeleste internum quod `Joseph', quod in errore esset bonum spirituale e naturali quod `Israel', quapropter id ei displicuit.   @1 omni$ </p>
