<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>159.</strong>要明白这些并不容易，除非他了解属天之人处于什么状态。属天之人的内在和外在是明显分开的，他能觉知什么属于内在，什么属于外在，并主是如何通过内在主导外在的。他们的后代却不同，因渴望外在的自我，他们的状态发生了改变，不再觉知内在与外在的分别，以为内在与外在是一回事，这是他们渴望自我的结果。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]159.</strong> It is not easy to perceive how the situation stands with all this unless one knows what heavenly people's state is like — that their inner being is distinguished from their outer being. The distinction is clear enough that they can tell what belongs to their inner and what to their outer being. They can also tell how the Lord uses the inner being to regulate the outer.<br />But the condition of this later generation changed because of their desire for autonomy, which belongs to the outer being. They no longer perceived the distinction between their inner and outer beings; for them it was as if the inner and outer were one. This perception is a result of the desire for autonomy. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 159</b></p><p><b>159.</b>
But it is not easy to perceive how the case is with these things unless the state of the celestial man is understood. In the celestial man the internal man is distinct from the external, indeed so distinct 
that the celestial man perceives what belongs to the internal man, and what to the external, and how the external man is governed through the internal by the Lord. But the state of the posterity 
of this celestial man, in consequence of desiring their Own, which belongs to the external man, was so changed that they no longer perceived the internal man to be distinct from the external, but imagined 
the internal to be one with the external, for such a perception takes place when man inclines to his Own. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 159</b></p><p><b>159.</b>
It is not easy to perceive however how these matters can be so unless the nature of the state of the celestial man is known. The state of the celestial man is such that the internal man is quite distinct 
from the external, so distinct in fact that he perceives what belongs to the internal man and what to the external man, and how the external man is governed by the Lord through the internal. But 
because his descendants desired the proprium, which belongs to the external man, their state became so altered that they no longer perceived any distinction between the internal man and the external. 
Instead they perceived the internal man as being one with the external, for this is what perception comes to be once man desires the proprium.  </p>

</p><b>159.</b>
Sed quomodo haec se habeant, non facile percipitur nisi sciatur qualis est status caelestis hominis; status caelestis hominis est talis ut internus homo sit distinctus ab externo, et quidem ita ut percipiat 
quae sunt interni et quae sunt externi et quomodo externus per internum regatur a Domino: at status hujus posteritatis, quia cupivit proprium, quod est externi hominis, mutatus est ita ut non 
amplius perceperit internum hominem distinctum esse ab externo, sed quasi quod internus esset unus cum externo: nam talis perceptio fit cum proprium cupitur. </p>
