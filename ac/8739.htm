<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8739节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8739.</strong>在来世，这样的人出现在右后方，位置稍微高一点。在那里，他们像神像一样坐着，一开始还被在世时侍奉过他们的仆人崇拜；但后来被他们嘲笑。令我惊讶的是，他们的脸在那里如同着了火那样发光；这是因为他们一直以为自己是圣徒，还以为他们就像太阳里的主。但是，尽管他们的脸显得火热，他们仍觉得很冷，有变暖的强烈愿望。由此明显可知，使他们发光的火可以说是一种鬼火。</p>

In the other life such appear to the right, backward, at some height, and there sit like idols, and also are at first worshiped by their servants, who had been with such; but are afterward held by them 
in derision. And what surprised me, their faces shine there as if from fire, which is because of their having believed that they were saints, and in the likeness of the Lord, who is in the sun. But 
notwithstanding this fiery appearance of their faces, they are cold, and have an intense desire to be made warm. From this it is plain that the fire with which they shine is as it were an ignis fatuus. </p>

In the next life such people appear to the rear on the right, in a somewhat elevated position. There they are seated like idols, and initially they are also venerated by their servants who had attended 
them [in the world] but are subsequently held to ridicule by them. And what has surprised me, their faces shine there as if from fire; this is due to their having believed that they were saints and 
also that they resembled the Lord who is in the sun. But although they appear to be fiery in their faces they are nevertheless cold and have an intense desire to warm up. From this it is evident that 
the fire from which they shine is a kind of will-o'-the-wisp. </p>

</p><b>8739.</b>
In altera vita tales apparent ad dextram retrorsum ad aliquam altitudinem, ac ibi sedent sicut idola, et quoque initio a famulis qui apud tales fuerunt coluntur, sed postea ab iis quoque risui habentur; 
et quod miratus sum, ibi lucent facie quasi ab igne, quod trahunt ex eo quod crediderint se sanctos fuisse, et (x)quoque instar Domini qui in sole; sed tametsi apparent facie sicut ignei, usque sunt 
frigidi, et impense cupiunt calefieri; inde patet quod ignis ex quo lucent sit sicut ignis fatuus. </p>
