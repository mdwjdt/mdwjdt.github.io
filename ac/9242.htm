<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9242节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9242.</strong>当恶人的生命陷入危险，或恶人患病时，在一个显着意义上被称为信仰的信心甚至在他们身上也看似一个属灵的信心。但由于在这些情况下，他们对其死后生命状态的思考要么源于对地狱的惊恐，要么源于对天堂的自私欲望，所以他们并没有信仰的信心。因为源于惊恐的东西不是从心发出的；源于爱自己的东西来自一颗邪恶的心。因此，当这些人脱离生命危险，或从疾病中康复时，他们就会回到以前的生活，即一种没有信心的生活，也就是没有信仰的生活。由此明显可知，被称为“信心”的信仰只可能存在于那些处于对邻之仁和对主之爱的人身上。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9242</b></p><p><b>9242.</b>
The confidence which in an eminent sense is called Faith, appears like spiritual confidence even with the evil, when their life is in danger, and when they are sick. But as they then think about the 
state of their life after death, either from the fear of hell, or from the love of self of heaven, they have not the confidence of Faith; for what is from fear is not from the heart, and what is from 
the love of self is from an evil heart; and therefore when such persons come back out of mortal danger, or when they recover from disease, they return into their former life, which was a life of no confidence, 
that is, a life of no Faith. From this it is evident that the Faith which is called "confidence," is possible only with those who are in charity toward the neighbor, and in love to the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9242</b></p><p><b>9242.</b>
The confidence which in a pre-eminent sense is called faith seems to be a spiritual confidence even with the evil when their lives are in danger or when they are sick. But because in these circumstances 
their thought about the state of their life after death springs from fear of hell or from a selfish desire for heaven, they do not possess the confidence of faith. For that which springs from fear 
does not come from the heart; and that which springs from self-love comes from an evil heart. Therefore when such people's lives cease to be in danger or when they recover from sickness they resume their 
old life, the life which was devoid of the confidence that is faith. From all this it is evident that faith which is called confidence can exist only with those who are governed by charity towards 
the neighbour and by love to the Lord.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 9242</b>
</p><b>9242.</b>
Confidentia quae in eminenti sensu vocatur fides apparet sicut confidentia spiritualis etiam apud malos cum in discriminibus vitae sunt et cum aegrotant; sed illi, quia tunc cogitant de statu vitae suae 
post mortem, vel ex timore pro inferno, vel ex amore sui pro caelo, confidentiam fidei {1} non habent, nam quod ex timore est, hoc non ex corde est, et quod ex amore sui est, hoc ex corde malo est; 
quapropter tales, cum extra discrimen vitae redeunt aut cum resipiscunt a morbo, in vitam priorem quae fuit vita non confidentiae, seu vita non fidei, redeunt.  Ex his patet quod fides quae vocatur 
confidentia non dabilis sit nisi apud illos qui in charitate erga proximum ac in amore in Dominum sunt. </p>
