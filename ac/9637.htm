<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9637节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9637.</strong>“一个板宽一肘半”表源于它的真理，其量足以实现联结。这从“一肘半”的含义清楚可知，“一肘半”是指完整或完全之物（参看<a href="9487.htm">9487</a>-<a href="9489.htm">9489</a>节），因而也指足量，因为这是完整或完全的东西。这真理之所以源于它，也就是源于“皂荚木作的板”所表示的良善（<a href="9634.htm">9634</a>，<a href="9635.htm">9635</a>节），是因为一切良善都有自己的真理，一切真理都有自己的良善。良善没有真理就无法显现或被看见，真理没有良善则无法存在，因为真理是良善的形式，良善是真理的存在。赋予良善的形状能使这良善显现或被看见，赋予真理的存在则使这真理拥有真实的存在。它们就像火焰和光；火焰没有光就无法显现或被看见；因此，它发出光，以使自己显现或被看见；光没有火焰则不存在。人的意愿和理解力也是这种情况；意愿没有理解力就无法显现或被看见，理解力没有意愿就不存在。爱和信的情况与良善和真理，或火焰和光，或意愿和理解力的极为相似。因为一切良善皆属于爱，一切真理皆属于植根于爱的信；人的意愿致力于接受属于爱的良善，理解力致力于接受属于信的真理。此外，爱是生命的火焰或火，信是生命的光。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9637</b></p><p><b>9637.</b>
And a cubit and half a cubit the breadth of one plank. That this signifies the truth from it which conjoins, as much as is sufficient, is evident from the signification of "one and a half," as being 
what is full (see n. 9487-9489), thus also as much as is sufficient, for this is what is full. The reason why this truth is from it, that is, from the good which is signified by "the planks of shittim 
wood" (n. 9634, 9635), is that every good has its truth, and every truth its good. Good without truth does not appear, and truth without good does not exist, for truth is the form of good, and good is 
the being of truth. It is from form that good appears, and it is from being that truth exists. The case herein is like that of flame and light; flame without light does not appear, and therefore it 
emits from itself light that it may appear; and light without flame does not exist. It is the same with man's will and his understanding; the will does not appear without the understanding, and the understanding 
does not exist without the will. As it is with good and truth, or with flame and light, or again with the will and understanding, even so it is with love and faith, for all good is of love, 
and all truth is of faith from love; and man's will has been allotted to the reception of the good which is of love, and his understanding to the reception of the truth which is of faith. Moreover, 
love is the flame or fire of life, and faith is the light of life. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9637</b></p><p><b>9637.</b>
'And a cubit and a half the breadth of one board' means the truth derived from it, a sufficient amount to effect a joining together. This is clear from the meaning of 'one and a half' as that which is 
complete, dealt with in <a href="9487.htm">9487</a>-<a href="9489.htm">9489</a>, thus also a sufficient amount, this being something complete. The reason why that truth is derived from it - from the good, meant by the boards made from shittim wood, <a href="9634.htm">9634</a>, <a href="9635.htm">9635</a> - is that every form of good has its own truth, and every truth has its own good. Good without truth cannot be seen, and truth without good cannot have any real existence; for truth gives 
shape to good, and good gives truth its being. The shape that good is given enables it to be seen, and the being that truth is given enables it to have real existence. They are like flame and light. 
A flame without light cannot be seen; therefore it sends out light to allow itself to be seen; and the light without the flame cannot have any existence. The situation is the same with the human will 
and its understanding. The will cannot be seen without the understanding, and the understanding has no existence without the will. The situation with love and faith too is very similar to that with 
good and truth, or flame and light, or will and understanding. For all good belongs to love, and all truth to faith rooted in love; and the human will is dedicated to the reception of the good belonging 
to love, and the understanding to the reception of the truth belonging to faith. Also the flame or fire of life is love, and the light of life is faith.  </p>

`Et cubitus et dimidius [cubitus] latitudo asseris unius': quod significet verum inde conjungens quantum satis, constat ex significatione `unius et dimidii' quod sint plenum, de qua n. 9487-9489, ita 
quoque quantum satis, nam hoc est plenum; quod verum illud sit inde, hoc est, ex bono, quod significatur per `asseres {1} ex lignis schittim,' n. 9634, 9635, est quia omni bono est suum verum, et omni 
vero est suum bonum; bonum absque vero non apparet, et verum absque bono non existit, nam verum est forma boni, et bonum est esse veri; ex forma habet bonum ut appareat, et ex esse habet verum ut existat, 
similiter se hoc habet sicut flamma et lux, flamma absque luce non apparet, quapropter a se emittit lucem ut appareat, et lux absque flamma non existit; similiter se habet cum voluntario hominis 
et ejus intellectuali, voluntarium non apparet absque intellectuali, et intellectuale non existit absque voluntario; consimiliter sicut se habet cum bono et vero, seu cum flamma et luce, seu cum voluntario 
et intellectuali, etiam se habet cum amore et fide, nam omne bonum est amoris, et omne verum est fidei ex amore {2}; et voluntarium hominis dicatum est receptioni boni quod amoris, ac intellectuale 
receptioni veri quod fidei; `etiam' flamma (o)seu ignis vitae est amor, et lux vitae est fides. @1 asserem$ @2 inde$ @3 et$ </p>
