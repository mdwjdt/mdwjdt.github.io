<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10001节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10001</strong>.“要带到会幕门口”表这二者在天堂里的结合。这从“带到”和“门口”的含义，以及“会幕”的代表清楚可知：“带到”是指同在和结合（参看<a href="9997.htm">9997</a>节），在此是指来自主的神性良善和神性真理在天堂里的结合；“门口”是指引入（参看<a href="8989.htm">8989</a>节）；“会幕”是指天堂（参看<a href="9457.htm">9457</a>，<a href="9481.htm">9481</a>，<a href="9485.htm">9485</a>，<a href="9963.htm">9963</a>节）。小公牛，公绵羊，筐子里无酵的饼、糕饼、薄饼，亚伦和他儿子之所以要出现在会幕门口，而且那时亚伦和他儿子要穿上衣服并抹油，而前面提到的那些东西要在那里献在坛上，是因为会幕门口所在的地方代表神性良善与神性真理的婚姻。也安设在帐幕门前的祭坛代表神性良善方面的主，而会幕代表神性真理方面的主。因此，在帐幕门前的地方代表良善与真理的结合，这种结合被称为天堂的婚姻。燔祭坛代表神性良善方面的主（参看<a href="9964.htm">9964</a>节），会幕代表神性真理方面的主（<a href="9963.htm">9963</a>节）。祭坛安设在那里，这清楚可见于摩西五经：<br />摩西把燔祭坛安设在帐幕门前。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出40.29.htm">40:29</a>）<br />良善与真理的结合就是天堂的婚姻，天堂就在于这婚姻，或说这婚姻就是天堂（参看<a href="2173.htm">2173</a>，<a href="2508.htm">2508</a>，<a href="2618.htm">2618</a>，<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>，<a href="3004.htm">3004</a>，<a href="3132.htm">3132</a>，<a href="3952.htm">3952</a>，<a href="4434.htm">4434</a>，<a href="6179.htm">6179</a>节）。由此明显可知，“要把亚伦和他儿子带到会幕门口”表示这二者，即来自主的神性良善和神性真理在天堂里的结合。</p>

Thou shalt bring near unto the door of the Tent of meeting. That this signifies the conjunction of both in heaven, is evident from the signification of "bringing near," as being presence and conjunction 
(see n. 9997), here the conjunction of Divine good and Divine truth from the Lord in heaven; from the signification of "the door," as being introduction (see n. 8989); and from the representation 
of the Tent of meeting, as being heaven (see n. 9457, 9481, 9485, 9963). That the bullock, the rams, the bread, the cakes, and the wafers of unleavened things in the basket, and Aaron with his sons, were 
to be presented at the door of the Tent of meeting, and that Aaron and his sons were there to be clothed with garments and anointed, and the things mentioned were to be there offered upon the altar, 
was because the place where was the door of the Tent of meeting represented the marriage of Divine good with Divine truth. For by the altar, which also was placed at the door of the Tent, was represented 
the Lord as to Divine good, and by the Tent of meeting was represented the Lord as to Divine truth; hence by the place at the door of the Tent was represented the conjunction of good and truth, 
which conjunction is called the heavenly marriage. (That by the altar of burnt offering was represented the Lord as to Divine good, see n. 9964; and by the Tent of meeting the Lord as to Divine truth, 
n. 9963.) That the altar was placed there is evident in Moses, "And Moses placed the altar of burnt-offering at the door of the Tent" (Exod. 40:29). (That the conjunction of good and truth is the heavenly 
marriage, and that it is heaven, see n. 2173, 2508, 2618, 2803, 3004, 3132, 3952, 4434, 6179.) From all this it is now evident that by "bringing Aaron and his sons near to the door of the Tent 
of meeting' is signified the conjunction of both, namely, of the Divine good and the Divine truth from the Lord in heaven. </p>

'You shall bring to the door of the tent of meeting' means the joining together of the two, in heaven. This is clear from the meaning of 'bringing' as presence and togetherness, as above in <a href="9997.htm">9997</a>, at 
this point the joining together of Divine Good and Divine Truth from the Lord, in heaven; from the meaning of 'the door' as introduction, dealt with in <a href="8989.htm">8989</a>; and from the representation of 'the tent of 
meeting' as heaven, dealt with in <a href="9457.htm">9457</a>, <a href="9481.htm">9481</a>, <a href="9485.htm">9485</a>, <a href="9963.htm">9963</a>. The reason why the young bull and the rams, the unleavened bread, cakes, and wafers in the basket, and Aaron together with his sons were presented 
at the door of the tent of meeting, and why the latter were then clothed with the garments and anointed there, and the former were offered on the altar there, was that the place where the door 
of the tent of meeting was, represented the marriage of Divine Good to Divine Truth. For the altar, which also was positioned before the door of the tent, represented the Lord in respect of Divine Good, 
while the tent of meeting represented the Lord in respect of Divine Truth. Consequently the place before the door of the tent represented the joining together of goodness and truth, a joining together 
that is called the heavenly marriage. Regarding the altar of burnt offering, that it represented the Lord in respect of Divine Good, see <a href="9964.htm">9964</a>; and regarding the tent of meeting, that it represented 
the Lord in respect of Divine Truth, <a href="9963.htm">9963</a>. The fact that the altar was positioned there is clear in Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
And Moses placed the altar of burnt offering at the door of the tent. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2040:29&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 40:29</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>As 
for the joining together of goodness and truth, that this is the heavenly marriage, and that in that marriage heaven consists, see <a href="2173.htm">2173</a>, <a href="2508.htm">2508</a>, <a href="2618.htm">2618</a>, <a href="2803.htm">2803</a>, <a href="3004.htm">3004</a> and following paragraphs, <a href="3132.htm">3132</a>, <a href="952.htm">952</a>, <a href="4434.htm">4434</a>, <a href="6179.htm">6179</a>. From all this it is now evident that bringing Aaron and his sons to the door of the tent of meeting means the joining together of the two, that is to say, of Divine Good and Divine Truth from 
the Lord, in heaven.  </p>

`Appropinquare facies ad ostium tentorii conventus': quod significet conjunctionem utriusque in caelo, constat ex significatione `appropinquare facere' quod sit praesentia et conjunctio, ut supra n. 
9997, hic conjunctio Divini Boni et Divini Veri a Domino in caelo {1}, ex significatione `ostii' quod sit introductio, de qua n. 8989, et ex repraesentatione `tentorii conventus' quod sit caelum, de 
qua n. 9457, 9481, 9485, 9963. Quod juvencus, arietes, panis, placentae, et lagana azymorum in corbe, et Aharon cum filiis sisterentur ad ostium tentorii conventus et quod hi ibi induerentur vestibus 
(c)et ungerentur, et illa ibi (x)offerrentur super altari, erat causa quia locus ubi ostium tentorii conventus repraesentabat conjugium Divini Boni cum Divino Vero {2}; per altare enim, quod etiam ad 
ostium tentorii positum fuit, repraesentabatur Dominus quoad Divinum Bonum, et per tentorium (o)conventus repraesentabatur Dominus quoad Divinum Verum; inde per locum ad ostium (c)tentorii repraesentabatur 
conjunctio boni et veri, quae conjunctio vocatur conjugium caeleste; quod per altare holocausti repraesentatus sit Dominus quoad Divinum Bonum, videatur n. 9964, et quod per tentorium conventus 
repraesentatus sit Dominus quoad Divinum Verum, n. 9963; quod altare ibi positum fuerit, constat apud Mosen,      	Et Moscheh altare holocausti posuit ad ostium tentorii, Exod. {3} xl 29; </p>
