<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6109节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6109.</strong>“全地都没有食物”表那良善不再显现。这从“食物”和“全地都没有”的含义清楚可知：“食物”是指爱与仁之良善，如刚才所述（<a href="6106.htm">6106</a>节）；“全地都没有”是指它不再显现。接下来论述的主题是内在属天层，即它如何将属世层中的一切事物都带入总体之下的秩序，以便记忆知识能与教会真理联结，并通过这些真理与属灵良善，通过这良善与内在属天层联结。但由于若不通过良善荒废、真理荒凉时的各个阶段，然后通过维持的各个阶段，记忆知识就无法被带入总体之下的秩序，所以接下来在内义上论述的是后面和前面所有这些阶段。不过，由于许多原因，当人活在这个世界上时，这些事很少发生在人身上；但在来世，它们会发生在所有正在重生的人身上。正因当人活在这个世界上时，它们不会发生在他身上，所以如果它们作为未知之事出现在他面前，在他看来就像前所未闻的深奥秘密，也就不足为奇了。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6109</b></p><p><b>6109.</b>
And there was no bread in all the land. That this signifies that good no longer appeared, is evident from the signification of "bread," as being the good of love and of charity (of which just above, 
n. 6106); and from the signification of there "being none in all the land," as being that it no longer appeared. In what now follows, the internal celestial is treated of, that it reduced all things in 
the natural into order under a general principle, to the end that there might be effected a conjunction of memory-knowledges with the truths of the church, and through these truths with spiritual good, 
and through this good with the internal celestial. But as the reduction of memory-knowledges into order under a general principle cannot be effected otherwise than through vastations of good and desolations 
of truth, and, soon afterward, through the giving of sustenance; therefore in what now follows, all these things are treated of in the internal sense. But for many reasons these things rarely 
take place with a man during his life in this world; whereas in the other life they take place with all who are being regenerated. And as they do not take place with man in this world, it is no wonder 
if they appear to him as things unknown, and seem to him like secret things never before heard of. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6109</b></p><p><b>6109.</b>
'And there was no bread in all the land' means that good was not apparent any longer. This is clear from the meaning of 'bread' as the good of love and charity, dealt with just above in <a href="6106.htm">6106</a>; and from 
the meaning of 'none in all the land' as the fact that none was apparent any longer. The subject in what follows below is the internal celestial, how it brought everything in the natural into order 
beneath the general whole, to the end that factual knowledge might become joined to the Church's truths, and through those truths to spiritual good, and through this good to the internal celestial. But 
since factual knowledge cannot be brought into order beneath the general whole except through stages when good is laid waste and truth is made desolate, and then by stages of sustainment, both the latter 
and the former stages are dealt with in the internal sense of what follows next. These things rarely happen to a person while he lives in the world, for a number of reasons; but in the next life 
they happen to all who are being regenerated. And since they do not happen to a person while he is in the world it is not surprising if they appear to him as things unknown and strike him as deep secrets 
about which no one has heard before. </p>

</p><b>6109.</b>
`Et panis nullus in omni terra': quod significet quod bonum non (x)apparuerit amplius, constat ex significatione `panis' quod sit bonum amoris et charitatis, de qua mox supra n. 6106; et ex significatione 
quod `nullus in omni terra' quod sit quod non (x)apparuerit amplius.  Agitur in nunc sequentibus de caelesti interno quod omnia in naturali in ordinem redegerit sub commune, ob finem ut conjunctio 
fieret scientificorum cum veris Ecclesiae, et per vera illa com bono spirituali, perque bonum hoc cum caelesti interno; ast quia redigere in ordinem scientifica sub commune non aliter fieri potest 
quam per vastationes boni et desolationes veri, et mox per sustentationes, ideo de his et illis in nunc sequentibus in sensu interno agitur; sed haec raro fiunt apud hominem dum in mundo vivit, ob plures 
causas; in altera autem vita fiunt apud omnes qui regenerantur; et quia haec non fiunt apud hominem in mundo, non mirum est si haec appareant ei ut ignota, ac obveniant ut arcana de quibus non prius auditum. </p>
