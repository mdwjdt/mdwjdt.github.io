<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5200节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5200.</strong>“肌肉肥壮”表属于仁之物。这从“肥壮”或“脂油”和“肌肉”的含义清楚可知：“肥壮”或“脂油”是指属天之物，在此用来论及从爱与仁所流出的良善（参看<a href="353.htm">353</a>节）；“肌肉”是指因从主所得来的良善而活过来的心智意愿部分（<a href="148.htm">148</a>，<a href="149.htm">149</a>，<a href="780.htm">780</a>，<a href="999.htm">999</a>，<a href="3812.htm">3812</a>，<a href="3813.htm">3813</a>节），因而是指从爱与仁所流出的良善。由此可知，“肌肉肥壮”表示属于仁之物，因为“长相俊美”表示属于信之物。“母牛”所表示的属世层的真理在此以这种方式通过它们的形式和本质来描述：它们的形式在于信的事物，他们的本质在于仁的事物。这一事实无法从字义看出来。</p>

And fat in flesh. That this signifies that were of charity, is evident from the signification of "fat," or "fatness," as being what is celestial and as being predicated of the good which is of love and 
charity (see n. 353); and from the signification of "flesh," as being the will vivified by good from the Lord (n. 148, 149, 780, 999, 3812, 3813), thus also the good which is of love and charity. From 
this it follows that by "fat in flesh" is signified that were of charity, because by "beautiful in look" is signified that were of faith. In this way the truths of the natural, signified by "kine," 
are described by their form and by their essence-their form consisting of the things of faith, and their essence of those of charity. That this is so does not appear from the literal sense. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5200</b></p><p><b>5200.</b>
'And fat-fleshed' means which are embodiments of charity. This is clear from the meaning of 'fat' or 'fatness' as that which is celestial and which is used here to refer to good which flows from love 
and charity, dealt with in <a href="353.htm">353</a>; and from the meaning of 'flesh' as the will part of the mind when made living by good received from the Lord, <a href="148.htm">148</a>, <a href="149.htm">149</a>, <a href="780.htm">780</a>, <a href="999.htm">999</a>, <a href="3812.htm">3812</a>, <a href="3813.htm">3813</a>, and thus also good which 
flows from love and charity. From this it follows that 'fat-fleshed' means matters of charity, while 'beautiful in appearance' means matters of faith. Thus the truths belonging to the natural, meant by 
'the cows', are described here - what they are so far as form is concerned and what they are essentially. In form they are matters of faith, in essence they are matters of charity. The truth of this 
cannot be seen from the sense of the letter. </p>

`Et pingues carne': quod significet quae charitatis, constat ex significatione `pinguis seu pinguedinis' quod sit caeleste et praedicetur de bono quod est amoris et charitatis, de qua n. 353; et ex 
significatione `carnis' quod sit voluntarium vivificatum per bonum a Domino, de qua n. 148, 149, 780, 999, 3812, 3813, ita quoque bonum quod amoris et charitatis; inde sequitur quod per `pingues carne' 
significentur quae charitatis, cum per `pulchras aspectu' quae fidei; ita describuntur vera naturalis quae {1}significantur per `vaccas', per suum formale et per suum essentiale; formale constituunt 
illa quae sunt fidei, et essentiale illa quae sunt charitatis; quod ita sit, non apparet ex sensu litterae. @1 sunt vaccae$ </p>
