<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1103.</strong>“迦南要作他的奴隶”表那些使敬拜纯由外在构成之人能履行低劣的服务。这一点从有关迦南是奴隶的论述（9:25-26）清楚可知。主在世上的教会中，象这样的人并非真的奴隶，因为其中很多人身居高位，管理所有人。他们行事并非出于仁爱和良知，而是严格恪守教会的外在事物，甚至谴责那些不同样遵守的人。不过，因为这类人没有仁爱和良知，并且使敬拜纯由没有内在的外在构成，所以在主的国度，即在来生，他们就是奴隶；因为他们就在不幸者之列。他们所履行的服务是低劣的，并且如此众多，以致难以在此一一列举，对此，蒙主慈悲，容后再述。<br />在来生，每个人无一例外地必须发挥某种作用，因为活在世上时，人生来唯一的目的就是为了能对他所在的社群，以及邻人发挥作用，而在来生，则照着主的美意发挥一定作用。人体也一样：其中每个部位，甚至本身看似毫无价值的东西，诸如本身就是废物之类的液体，都必须发挥某种作用，如大量唾液，胆汁等等，它们不仅服务于食物，还分离废物、洁净肠道。田地和葡萄园中的肥料和粪便也是这样，凡此种种，不一而足。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1103.</strong> The meaning of Canaan will be slave to him as the fact that those who identify worship solely with external forms can perform lowly duties is established by the things said about Canaan as a slave above, in the last verses — 25, 26 [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1103/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1094" target=_top>1094</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1103/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1097" target=_top>1097</a>].<br />To be sure, people like this are not slaves in the Lord's church on earth. Many of them occupy top positions, higher than anyone else. Nothing that they do has its basis in charity or conscience, although they observe the external requirements of religion very strictly and even condemn those who do not. But there is a consequence to the fact that they have no neighborly love or conscience and consider the outward show, devoid of inner content, to be the whole of worship. The consequence is that they are slaves in the Lord's kingdom (the other life), unfortunates that they are. The tasks they perform are menial and too numerous to discuss in detail. (I will have more to say on them later, however, by the Lord's divine mercy.){*1} [2] Everyone, no matter who, has to do useful work in the next life. We are born for no purpose but to be useful to the community we live in and to our neighbor as long as we are alive in the world, and to serve at the Lord's good pleasure in the other world.<br />The situation resembles that in the human body. Every part of our anatomy has to serve a function, including elements that in themselves are worthless — fluids that exist to be excreted, for instance, as the many types of saliva do, and the different types of bile, and others. Not only do they have to work on the food, they also have to extract waste products and clean out the intestines. Another parallel is the manure and dung used on fields and in vineyards. And so on.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg's description in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1103/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6387" target=_top>6387-6394</a> of those represented by Issachar may be the passage in question. However, this promise may be fulfilled as early as <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1103/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1110" target=_top>1110</a> immediately below. There people who do good deeds for external reasons believe themselves to be cutting wood in the afterlife; Swedenborg connects them with the woodcutters mentioned in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1103/bible_king-james-version_joshua_9_23" target=_top>Joshua 9:23</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1103/bible_king-james-version_joshua_9_27" target=_top>27</a>. Compare <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1103/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_441" target=_top>True Christianity 441</a>, where Swedenborg refers to people who do good only for external rewards as "hired workers;" in the spiritual world they take on the appearance of woodcutters. This is again likely an allusion to the Gibeonites who are made slaves to the house of God in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1103/bible_king-james-version_joshua_9_21-27" target=_top>Joshua 9:21-27</a>: hewing wood is specifically described there as one of their menial tasks.

And Canaan shall be his servant. That this signifies that those who make worship consist solely in externals are able to perform vile offices, is evident from what has been said above, under the preceding 
verses (25, 26), about Canaan, as being a servant. Such men are not indeed servants in the church of the Lord on earth, for there are many of them who hold high stations, and who are set over all 
others, who do nothing from charity and conscience, and yet observe with much strictness the externals of the church, and even condemn those who do not observe them. But such persons, because they are 
in no charity and conscience, and make worship consist solely in externals without internals, are servants in the kingdom of the Lord, that is, in the other life; for they are among the unhappy. The 
services which they there perform are vile, and are so many that they cannot be well set forth here, but of the Divine mercy of the Lord will be described hereafter. For in the other life everyone without 
exception must perform some use, because man is born for no other end than that he may perform use to the society in which he is and to the neighbor, while he lives in the world, and in the other 
life according to the good pleasure of the Lord. The case in this respect is the same as it is in the human body, every part of which must perform some use, even things which in themselves are of no 
value, such as humors which in themselves are excrementitious, as are the many salival fluids, the biles, and other secretions, which must be of service not only to the food, but in separating the excrements 
and purging the intestines. Such also are the uses of manure and dung in the fields and vineyards; and many other such things. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1103</b></p><p><b>1103.</b>
'Canaan will be his slave' means that people who make worship consist solely in external things are able to perform inferior services. This is clear from what has been stated at verses 25, 26, about 
Canaan being a slave. People such as these are not in fact 'slaves' in the Lord's Church on earth, for there are many of them who hold primary positions and who are over all others. They do nothing from 
charity and conscience, and yet very strictly they keep up the external things of the Church, and even condemn those who do not do the same. But because no charity and no conscience exist with them, 
and they make worship consist solely in external things devoid of internal, such persons are 'slaves' in the Lord's kingdom, that is, in the next life; for they are among the unhappy. The types of service 
they perform there are inferior, which, being many, cannot be explained satisfactorily here, but will in the Lord's Divine mercy be dealt with later on. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Indeed everyone, no matter who, must 
in the next life perform a use; for the sole purpose for which a person is born is that he may perform a use to the community he is in, and to his neighbour, while he lives in the world, and in the 
next life may perform a use in accord with the Lord's gracious purposes. It is the same with the human body: everything there must perform a use - even the things which in themselves seem to be good 
for nothing, such as fluids which in themselves are waste matter, for example the many secretions of saliva, bile, and so on which not only have to serve food passing through but also to separate waste 
matters and clear the intestines. The same applies to the use performed by manure and dung in fields and vineyards; and so on. </p>

'Erit Canaan servus illi': quod significet qui solum in externis ponunt cultum quod vilia officia praestare possint, constat ex illis quae dicta sunt supra ad vers. praec. 25, 26 de Canaane quod sit 
servus: tales quidem non sunt 'servi' in Ecclesia Domini in terris, plures enim eorum sunt qui primas tenent et qui reliquis praesunt, qui nihil ex charitate et conscientia faciunt, et tamen admodum 
stricte observant externa Ecclesiae, immo etiam damnant eos qui non observant; sed tales, quia nulla charitate et nulla conscientia sunt, et in externis absque internis solum cultum ponunt, sunt 'servi' 
in regno Domini, hoc est, in altera vita, nam inter infelices sunt; servitia quae ibi praestant sunt vilia, quae quia plura sunt, non ita exponi possunt, sed de iis, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, 
in sequentibus; omnis enim, quicumque est, debet in altera vita praestare usum, [2] nam homo nusquam propter alium finem nascitur quam ut usum praestet societati in qua est, et proximo, dum vivit in mundo; 
in altera vita usum secundum beneplacitum Domini:  se habent haec sicut in corpore humano; quicquid ibi est, usum praestare debet, etiam quae in se nauci sunt, sicut humores qui in se excrementitii, 
ut sunt plures salivales, tum biles, et similia, quae non solum cibis inservire debent, sed etiam separare excrementitia, et expurgare intestina; aut sicut in agris et vineis, fimi et stercora; et 
sic porro. </p>
