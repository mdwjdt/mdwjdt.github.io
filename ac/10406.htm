<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10406节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10406</strong>.“用凿子塑造它”表他们自己的聪明的一个产物。这从“用凿子塑造”的含义清楚可知，当论述的主题是一个偶像时，“用凿子塑造”是指利用人自己的聪明制造虚假教义，当圣言的字义被用来支持爱自己爱世界时，这种情况就会发生。当这些爱掌权时，一个人就不会有任何来自天堂的光照。相反，他从自己的聪明中汲取一切事物或观念，并用圣言的字义来证实它们；他通过一种错误的使用和一种败坏的解释歪曲这字义，然后支持这类事物或观念，因为他是它们的作者。<br />圣言的各个地方都提到了“雕像”和“铸像”。完全按字面理解圣言的人以为在这些地方，它们仅仅是指偶像。然而，所指的并不是偶像，而是虚假的教义事物，就是一个人在自己的某种爱的指引下所塑造的那种。当这些虚假被塑造得能连贯起来，并看似真理时，它们就由“雕像”来表示；当这些虚假被融为一体，以支持外在的爱，好使邪恶看似良善时，它们就由“铸像”来表示。由于“金牛犊”表示这两种虚假，所以经上在此说亚伦用凿子塑造它，以此表示塑造虚假，以至于它们看似真理；紧接着经上说，他把金子铸成一只牛犊；后来又说把它扔在火中，牛犊便出来了（32:24），以此表示将虚假融为一体，以支持外在的爱，好使邪恶看似良善。凡由人而非主所锻造的教义都是这种情况。当人以自己的荣耀和利益为目的时，教义就是由他锻造的；但当邻舍的良善和主国度的良善被视为目的时，教义就是由主锻造的。<br />在下列经文中，“雕像”和“铸像”就表示这类事物。以赛亚书：<br />你那包银的雕像和镀金的铸像。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.22.htm">30:22</a>）<br />“包银的雕像”表示虚假所呈现的表象，即好像它们是真理；“镀金的铸像”表示邪恶所呈现的表现，即好像它们是良善；“包”和“镀”表示它们被赋予或披上的外在表象。“银”表示真理，“金”表示良善，这就是为何经上说雕像是“银”的，“铸像”是金的。关于“银”表示真理，“金”表示良善，可参看前文（<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="1552.htm">1552</a>，<a href="5658.htm">5658</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>，<a href="6917.htm">6917</a>，<a href="9874.htm">9874</a>，<a href="9881.htm">9881</a>节）。<br />同一先知书：<br />匠人铸造雕像，金匠用金子包裹，又为它铸造银链。他为自己寻找巧匠，预备不能摇动的雕像。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.19.htm">40:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.20.htm">20</a>）<br />这描述的是虚假的形成，好使它们连贯起来，仿佛它们是真理；“雕像”表示这种虚假；“匠人”表示利用自己的聪明形成它的人；“金匠用金子包裹”表示当他使得它看似良善时；“铸造银链”表示将它们都连贯起来；“不能摇动”表示因此无法被削弱和摧毁。<br /><br />制造雕刻偶像的尽都虚空；他们所喜悦的都无益处。谁制造神明，铸造无益的铸像？他的同伴都必羞愧！匠人也不过是人。他用钳子塑铁，在火炭中加工，用利锤使它成形，用他有力的膀臂锤成。他塑造木头，拉出墨斗，用直尺划线；用用圆规标记，照人的美丽，把它造成人的形式，好住在房屋中。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.9.htm">44:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.13.htm">13</a>）<br />这描述的也是虚假教义如何被塑成，好叫它们可能连贯起来，看似真理和良善。此处的一切细节都描述了一个人如何利用自己的聪明，在自己的情欲、渴望和爱的指引之下实现这一切的。那些知道圣言中的一切事物都有内义，他们必须以属灵的方式来理解的人都能看出这是事实。否则，如此描述一个雕像的形成又有什么目的呢？“照人的美丽，把它造成人的形式”表示为使它看似真理和良善；因为就内义而言，“人”（a man）表示真理，“人性”（a human being）表示该真理的良善。<br />耶利米书:<br />各人都因知识变得愚昧；各铸匠都因他的雕像羞愧。他的铸像本是虚假的，其中并无气息（或灵）。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶10.14.htm">10:14</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.17.htm">51:17</a>）<br />“雕像”在此表示出于人自己的聪明之物；“铸像”表示符合人的爱之物，这是显而易见的；因为经上说“各人都因知识变得愚昧；各铸匠都因他的雕像羞愧，他的铸像本是虚假的”；“知识”在此表示人自己的聪明，“虚假”表示邪恶的虚假；由于这些事物没有神的东西在里面，故经上说“其中并无气息（或灵）”。<br />同一先知书：<br />有剑临到它的马匹和战车，临到它的宝物，使它们就被抢夺。有干旱临到它的众水，使它们乾涸；因为这是雕像之地。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.37.htm">50:37</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.38.htm">38</a>）<br />“雕像之地”表示一个虚假在其中掌权的教会，这一点从灵义上所理解的这几节经文的每个细节也很清楚地看出来。没有灵义，“有剑临到它的马匹和战车，临到它的宝物，有干旱临到它的众水”不就是没有任何灵在里面的话语或声音吗？而当以内义来理解这些细节时，那么很明显，这几节经文描述的是教会真理的毁灭，因而虚假将要在那里掌权，这就是“雕像之地”。因为“剑”表示与真理争战并摧毁它的虚假；“马”表示一种被光照的理解力；“战车”表示教义事物；“宝物”表示关于真理和良善的认知或知识；“乾涸的众水”表示真理不复存在；“地”表示教会。“剑”表示与虚假争战的真理，在反面意义上表示与真理争战并摧毁它的虚假（参看<a href="2799.htm">2799</a>，<a href="6353.htm">6353</a>，<a href="7102.htm">7102</a>，<a href="8294.htm">8294</a>节）；“马”表示一种被光照的理解力（<a href="2760.htm">2760</a>-<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>，<a href="3217.htm">3217</a>，<a href="6534.htm">6534</a>节）；“战车”表示教义事物（<a href="5321.htm">5321</a>，<a href="8146.htm">8146</a>，<a href="8148.htm">8148</a>，<a href="8215.htm">8215</a>节）；“宝物”表示关于真理和良善的认知或知识（<a href="10227.htm">10227</a>节）；“水”表示真理（<a href="2702.htm">2702</a>，<a href="3058.htm">3058</a>，<a href="3424.htm">3424</a>，<a href="4976.htm">4976</a>，<a href="5668.htm">5668</a>，<a href="8137.htm">8137</a>，<a href="8138.htm">8138</a>，<a href="8568.htm">8568</a>，<a href="9323.htm">9323</a>，<a href="10238.htm">10238</a>节）；“地”表示教会（参看<a href="9325.htm">9325</a>节提到的地方）。由此明显可知“有干旱临到它的众水，使它们乾涸”是什么意思，“雕像之地”又是什么意思。<br />哈巴谷书：<br />雕像有什么益处，制造者将它刻出来呢？铸像，就是虚谎的师傅，制造者倚靠他自己所造的东西有什么益处呢？（哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈2.18.htm">2:18</a>）<br />从这些话也明显可知，“雕像”和“铸像”不是指一座雕像和一座铸像，而是指正在捏造的虚假和这虚假所支持的邪恶；因为经上说“制造者”和“虚谎的师傅”。<br />在下列经文中，“雕像”和“铸像”具有类似含义，以赛亚书：<br />巴比伦倾倒了，她一切的雕像都打碎于地。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛21.9.htm">21:9</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />那倚靠雕像、对铸像说，你们是我们的神明的，这种人必大大蒙羞。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.17.htm">42:17</a>）<br /><br />我给你说明，使你听见，免得你说，是我的偶像行了这一切；是我的雕像和我的铸像命定了这些事。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛48.5.htm">48:5</a>）<br />何西阿书：<br />他们招呼自己，从他们面前离开，向诸巴力献祭，给雕像烧香。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何11.2.htm">11:2</a>）<br />弥迦书：<br />撒玛利亚一切的雕像必被打碎，她为妓女所得的一切淫资必被火烧，我必使她一切的偶像成为荒场。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥1.7.htm">1:7</a>）<br />由于“雕像”和“铸像”所表示的教义的虚假和邪恶是由人自己的聪明在他的爱的指引下编造的，故在圣言中，它们还被称为“人手的工作”、“匠人的手工或匠人的手所作的”和“工匠的手工或工匠的手所作的”，如在下列经文，何西阿书：<br />现今他们罪越犯越多，用银子照自己的聪明为自己制造铸像，完全是匠人的工作。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何13.2.htm">13:2</a>）<br />摩西五经：<br />制造耶和华所憎恶的雕像，或铸像，就是匠人手工的，那人必受咒诅！（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申27.15.htm">27:15</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />他们的偶像是金，是银，是人手所作的。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗115.4.htm">115:4</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗135.15.htm">135:15</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />他们向别神烧香，跪拜自己的手所作的。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶1.16.htm">1:16</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />以色列人尽以手所作的惹我发怒。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶32.30.htm">32:30</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶44.8.htm">44:8</a>）<br /><br />有一人从森林中砍木，就是工匠的手用斧子所作的。他们用银、金妆饰它，用钉子和锤子钉稳。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶10.3.htm">10:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶10.4.htm">4</a>）<br />“手所作的或手工”表示出于人的自我之物，因而出于人自己的理解力和自己的意愿之物；这些事物都是自我的产物，是由于自我之爱而存在的理解力和意愿这二者的产物；这就是教会中的一切虚假的起源。由于一切虚假皆出于人的自我或人自己的东西，并且“手所作的或手工”表示源于这自我之物，故经上禁止在筑坛和建殿的石头上动铁器、斧头或凿子，这一点明显可见于这些经文，摩西五经：<br />你若为我筑一座石坛，不可用凿过的石头建它，因你在上头一动凿子，就把坛污秽了。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出20.22.htm">20:22</a>）<br />申命记：<br />你若要为耶和华筑一座石坛，不可在石头上动铁器。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申27.5.htm">27:5</a>）<br />列王纪上：<br />房子是用那里带来的整石建的。建房的时候，锤子、斧子，及任何铁器的噪音都没有听见。（列王纪上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上6.7.htm">6:7</a>）<br />引用这些经文是为了叫人们明白亚伦“用凿子塑造金子，把它铸成一只牛犊”是什么意思。</p>

And formed it with a graving tool. That this signifies from their own intelligence, is evident from the signification of "forming with a graving tool," when said concerning an idol, as being to prepare 
false doctrine from one's own intelligence, which is effected by the application of the sense of the letter of the Word in favor of the loves of self and of the world; for when these loves reign, the 
man is not in any enlightenment from heaven, but takes all things from his own intelligence, and confirms them from the sense of the letter of the Word, which he falsifies by a wrong application and 
a perverted interpretation, and afterward favors such things because they are from himself. [2] In the Word throughout mention is made of "graven images" and "molten images." They who apprehend the 
Word merely according to the letter suppose that idols only are meant by these images. Nevertheless idols are not meant, but false doctrinal things of the church, such as are formed by man himself under 
the guidance of some love of his. The forming of these falsities to cohere, and to appear as if they were truths, is signified by a "graven image." The joining of them together to favor external loves, 
so that evils may appear as goods, is signified by a "molten image." As both are meant by the "golden calf," therefore it is here said that Aaron "formed it with a graving tool," by which is meant 
the forming of falsities so as to appear as if they were truths; and by its being said that he "made the gold a molten calf." And afterward that he "cast it into the fire, and it came forth a calf" 
(verse 24), means the joining together to favor external loves so that evils may appear as goods. Such moreover is the case with all doctrine that is made from man, and not from the Lord; and it is made 
from man when he has as his end his own glory or his own profit; but it is from the Lord when the good of the neighbor and the good of the Lord's kingdom are regarded as the end. [3] Such things 
are signified by "graven images" and "molten images" in the following passages. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Ye shall judge unclean the covering of the graven images of thy silver, and the clothing of the molten 
image of thy gold (Isa. 30:22); </p>
<p>"the covering of the graven images of silver" denotes the appearing of falsities as if they were truths; "the clothing of the molten image of gold" denotes the appearing 
of evils as if they were goods; for "covering" and "clothing" denote outward appearances which are put on, or with which things are invested. "Silver" denotes truth, and therefore graven images are 
said to be "of silver;" and "gold" denotes good (n. 1551, 1552, 5658, 6914, 6917, 9874, 9881). [4] Again: </p>
<p>     The artificer casteth a graven image, and the metal-caster spreadeth it over with gold, 
and casteth silver chains. He seeketh unto him a wise artificer to prepare a graven image that shall not be moved (Isa. 40:19, 20); </p>
<p>there is here described the forming of falsities so as to cohere 
and to appear as if they were truths; a "graven image" denotes this falsity; an "artificer" denotes a man who forms it from his own intelligence; "the metal-caster spreadeth it over with gold" denotes 
when he causes it to appear as good; "he casteth silver chains" denotes by means of coherence; "that shall not be moved" denotes which on this account cannot be weakened and destroyed. [5] Again: </p>
<p> 
    They that form a graven image are vanity, and their most desirable things do not profit. Who hath formed a god, and cast a molten image that profiteth not? All his fellows shall be ashamed; and the 
workmen themselves. He fashioneth the iron with the tongs, he both worketh in the coals and formeth it with sharp hammers, so he worketh it with his strong arm; he fashioneth wood; he stretcheth out 
a line; he marketh it out with a rule; he maketh it into its corners; and he marketh it out with the compasses; and maketh it into the form of a man, according to the beauty of a man, to dwell in the 
house (Isa. 44:9-13); </p>
<p>here also is described in what manner false doctrinal things are formed so that they may cohere, and appear as truths and as goods. By every detail is here described how this is 
effected, when done from man's own intelligence under the guidance of pleasure, of cupidity, and of love. That this is so can be seen by those who know that all things in the Word have an internal sense, 
by which they are spiritually understood. Otherwise to what purpose would be such a description of the forming of a graven image? That it may appear as truth and as good is signified by "making 
it in the form of a man [vir] according to the beauty of a man" [homo]; for in the internal sense "a man" [vir] denotes truth, and "a man" [homo], the good of this truth. [6] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Every 
man is become a fool from knowledge; every metal-caster is put to shame by his graven image; for his molten image is a lie, and there is no breath in them (Jer. 10:14; 51:17); </p>
<p>that a "graven image" 
here denotes that which is from man's own intelligence; and a "molten image" that which is according to the love, is very manifest; for it is said that "every man is become a fool by knowledge, and every 
metal-caster is put to shame by his graven image," and that "his molten image is a lie;" "knowledge" here denotes man's own intelligence, and "a lie," the falsity of evil; because there is not what 
is Divine in them, it is said that "there is no breath in them." [7] Again: </p>
<p>     O sword against her horses, and against her chariots, against her treasures, that they may be plundered; a drought 
is upon her waters that they may dry up; for a land of graven images is this (Jer. 50:37, 38). That "a land of graven images" denotes the church where falsities reign, is also plainly evident from every 
detail there understood in its spiritual sense; without which sense, what would be "a sword against horses, against chariots, against treasures," and "a drought upon waters," but sounding words without 
any spirit in them? Whereas from every detail understood in its internal sense it is plain that the destruction of the church as to truths is here described, and thus that falsities would reign 
therein, which are "a land of graven images." For a "sword" denotes falsity fighting with and destroying truths; "horses" denote an understanding which is enlightened; "chariots" denote doctrinal things; 
"treasures," the knowledges of truth and good; "waters upon which is a drought," denote truths, that they are no more; and "land" denotes the church. (That a "sword" denotes truth fighting against 
falsity; and in the opposite sense falsity fighting against truth and destroying them, see n. 2799, 6353, 7102, 8294; that "horses" denote an understanding which is enlightened, n. 2760-2762, 3217, 6534; 
that "chariots" denote doctrinal things, n. 5321, 8146, 8148, 8215; "treasures," the knowledges of truth and of good, n. 10227; "waters," truths, n. 2702, 3058, 3424, 4976, 5668, 8137, 8138, 8568, 
9323, 10238; and "land" or "earth," the church, see the places cited in n. 9325.) From this it is evident what is meant by "a drought upon the waters that they may dry up," and what by "a land of graven 
images." [8] In Habakkuk: </p>
<p>     What profiteth the graven image, that the maker thereof hath graven it, and the molten image and the teacher of a lie, that the maker of his invention trusteth thereupon? 
(Hab. 2:18); </p>
<p>from these words it is also evident that by a "graven image" and a "molten image" are not meant a graven and a molten image; but falsity which is invented, and evil which falsity 
defends; for it is said "the maker of his invention," and "the teacher of a lie." [9] Like things are signified by a "graven image" and a "molten image" in the following passages: </p>
<p>     Babylon is fallen; 
and all the graven images of her gods he hath cast forth unto the ground (Isa. 21:9).      They shall all be greatly ashamed that trust in a graven image, that say unto a molten image, Ye are 
our gods (Isa. 42:17).      I have declared it to thee, and I made thee hear it, lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done this; my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them (Isa. 48:5).  
    They called themselves, and they went from their faces; they sacrificed to the baals, and burned incense to graven images (Hos. 11:2).      All the graven images of Samaria shall be ground 
to pieces, and all her harlot hires shall be burned with fire, and all her Idols will I make a waste (Micah 1:7). [10] Inasmuch as falsities and evils of doctrine, which are signified by "graven and 
molten images," are fabricated by man's own intelligence under the guidance of his love, therefore also in the Word they are called "the work of man's hands," "the work of the hands of the artificer," 
and "the work of the hands of the workman;" as in the following passages: </p>
<p>     They sin more and more, they make them a molten image of their silver, idols in their own intelligence, all of them the 
work of the artificers (Hos. 13:2). Cursed be the man that maketh a graven or molten image, an abomination unto Jehovah, the work of the hands of the artificer (Deut. 27:15).      Their idols are silver 
and gold, the work of man's hands (Ps. 115:4; 135:15).      They have burned incense unto other gods, and have bowed themselves to the works of their own hands (Jer. 1:16).      One cutteth wood 
out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman with the axe. They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers (Jer. 10:3, 4). [11] "The work of the hands" 
denotes that which is from man's own, thus that which is from his own understanding and his own will; and those things are from his own, of both understanding and will, which are of the love of self; 
this is the origin of all the falsities in the church. As all falsities are from what is man's own, and by "the work of the hands" is signified that which is from this, it was therefore forbidden to 
move an iron, an axe, or a graving tool, upon the stones of which the altar was built, and also the temple, as is evident in these passages: </p>
<p>     If thou wilt make Me an altar of stones, thou shall 
not build it of hewn stones; for if thou move thy tool upon it, thou shalt profane it (Exod. 20:25).      If thou shalt build to Jehovah an altar of stones, thou shalt not move an iron upon them (Deut. 
27:5).      The house was built of entire stone, as it was brought; for there was neither hammer, nor axe, nor any instrument of iron, heard in the house, while it was being built (1 Kings 6:7).  
    These things have been adduced in order that it may be known what is meant by Aaron's "forming the gold with a graving tool, and making it a molten calf." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10406</b></p><p><b>10406.</b>
'And fashioned it with a chisel' means a product of their own intelligence. This is clear from the meaning of 'fashioning with a chisel', when an idol is the subject, as producing false teachings by 
the use of one's own intelligence, which happens when the literal sense of the Word is used in support of self-love and love of the world. When these rule a person he does not have any enlightenment from 
heaven. Instead his own intelligence is what he draws on for all the ideas he acquires; and these he substantiates by means of the literal sense of the Word, which he falsifies by using it in a wrong 
way and interpreting it in a perverted manner. And after this he favours those ideas because he is the author of them.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Various places throughout the Word contain references to graven images 
and molded images. People who take the Word entirely literally suppose that no more than idols should be understood by them in those places. Not idols however should be understood but false matters 
of doctrine upheld by the Church, such as are fashioned by a person himself when guided by some love of his own. Falsities when fashioned in such a way that they may hang together and look like truths 
are meant by 'a graven image'; and falsities when fused together in support of external kinds of love in such a way that evils look like forms of good are meant by 'a molded image'. And since 'the golden 
calf' is used to mean both types of falsities it says here that Aaron fashioned it with a chisel, by which the fashioning of falsities to look like truths should be understood; then immediately after 
it says that he made the gold into a calf of molded [metal], and in verse 24 that he threw it into the fire and the calf came out, by which the fusing together of falsities in support of external 
kinds of love in order that evils may look like forms of good should be understood. This is also what every matter of doctrine is like that is forged by a person and not by the Lord. Matters of doctrine 
are forged by the person when that person has his own glory and gain as the end in view; but they are forged by the Lord when the good of the neighbour and the good of the Lord's kingdom are regarded 
as the end in view.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 These kinds of things are meant by 'graven images' and 'molded images' in the following places: In Isaiah,  </p>

You will judge unclean the covering of the graven images

</blockquote>
<p>'The covering of the graven images of silver' means the appearance presented by falsities, as though they were truths, 
and 'the clothing of the molded image of gold' means the appearance presented by evils, as though they were forms of good; for 'the covering' and 'the clothing' mean the outward appearances with which 
they are endued or coated over. 'Silver' means truth, and 'gold' good, and this is why 'the graven images' are said to be 'of silver' and 'the molded image' to be 'of gold'. For the meaning of 'silver' 
as truth and of 'gold' as good, see <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="1552.htm">1552</a>, <a href="5658.htm">5658</a>, <a href="6914.htm">6914</a>, <a href="6917.htm">6917</a>, <a href="9874.htm">9874</a>, <a href="9881.htm">9881</a>.  </p>

 In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
The craftsman casts a graven image, and a goldsmith overlays it with gold, and casts 
silver chains for it. He seeks for himself a skilled<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> craftsman to make ready a graven image which is immovable. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2040:19,20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 40:19,20</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This describes a fashioning of falsities so that they may hang together 
and look as though they were truths. 'A graven image' means such falsity, 'the craftsman' means the person who fashions it by the use of self-intelligence, 'a goldsmith overlays it with gold' means 
when he makes it to look like what is good, 'casts silver chains for it' means by making it all hang together, 'which is immovable' means which cannot therefore be weakened and destroyed.  </p>

<p><b>[5]</b>
 In 
the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
Makers of the graven image, [all are] vanity; and their most desirable things are profitless. Who has fashioned a god, and cast a molded image, that it may not profit him? All 
his companions will be ashamed, and the workmen themselves. He fashions the iron with tongs, and works it with the coals, and forms it with sharp hammers; so he makes it with his strong arm<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a>. He fashions 
wood, stretches out a cord, and marks it off with a ruler. He makes it into its angles, and marks it out with a ring, and makes it into the form of a man (vir), according to the beauty of a human 
being, to dwell in the  house. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2044:9-14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 44:9-14</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This too describes how false teachings are fashioned so that they may hang together and look like truths and forms of good. Every detail here serves 
to describe how this is brought about by a person using self-intelligence under the guidance of his own wishes, desire, and love. The truth of this may be seen by those who know that all things in the 
Word have an inner meaning by means of which they must be understood in a spiritual way. Why else should such a description of fashioning a graven image be given? To the end that it may look like truth 
and good is the meaning when it says that 'he makes it in the form of a man, according to the beauty of a human being'; for in the internal sense 'a man' means truth and 'a human being' the good of 
that truth.  </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Here 'graven image' means that which is the product of self-intelligence, and 'molded image' that which accords with the person's love. This meaning is plainly 
evident, for it says that a person has been made stupid by knowledge, and every metal-caster has been filled with shame by his graven image, and that his molded image is a lie, 'knowledge' here 
being self-intelligence, and 'a lie' the falsity of evil; and since those objects have nothing of God within them it says that there is no spirit in those things.  </p>

 In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
O sword

</blockquote>
<p>'The land of graven images' means a Church in which falsities reign. This too is perfectly clear from the details of these verses when understood in the spiritual sense. Without that 
sense what would a sword against horses, against chariots, against treasures, and a drought on waters be but words or sounds that have no spirit within them? But from those details when understood in 
the internal sense it is evident that these verses describe the destruction of the Church's truths and so the subsequent reign of falsities there, meant by 'the land of graven images'. For 'sword' means 
falsity engaged in conflict with and destroying truths, 'horses' an enlightened power of understanding, 'chariots' matters of doctrine, 'treasures' cognitions or knowledge of truth and good, 'waters 
on which there is a drought' the non-existence of truths any longer, and 'the land' the Church.  </p>
<p>'Sword' means truth engaged in conflict against falsity, and in the contrary sense falsity engaged

<p><b>[8]</b>
 In Habakkuk,  </p>
<blockquote>
What profit 
is a graven image since its image-maker has graven it, and a molded image and a teacher of lies, since the image-maker trusts in the thing he himself has made? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hab%202:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hab 2:18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>From these words too it is 
evident that 'a graven image' and 'a molded image' are not used to mean a graven image and a molded image but falsity that is being made up and the evil to which the falsity lends support; for it speaks 
of 'the image-maker' and 'a teacher of lies'.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 'Graven image' and 'molded image' have similar meanings in the following places: In Isaiah,  </p>

 Since falsities and evils upheld by religious teaching, which 
are meant by 'graven images and molded images', are forged by a person's self-intelligence under the guidance of his love, the Word also calls them 'the work of human hands', 'the work of the hands 
of a craftsman', and 'the work of the hands of a workman', as in the following places: In Hosea,  </p>
<blockquote>
Now they sin more and more, they make for themselves a molded image from their silver, idols by their
