<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9079节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9079.</strong>“牛无论用角抵触了儿子或用角抵触了女儿”表对邪恶的情感向源于内层事物的信之真理和良善所发起的攻击。这从“用角抵触”、“儿子”和“女儿”的含义清楚可知：“用角抵触”是指伤害（<a href="9065.htm">9065</a>节），因而是指一种攻击；“儿子”是指信之真理；“女儿”是指信之良善（<a href="489.htm">489</a>-<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>，<a href="2362.htm">2362</a>，<a href="2623.htm">2623</a>节）。它们之所以是源于内层事物的信之真理和良善，是因为内层事物就像父母，良善和真理如同儿女那样从这些事物中出生。事实上，对一个重生之人来说，良善和真理就像不同的世代。有些处在父母的位置上，有些处在孩子的位置上，有些则处在女婿和儿媳的位置上，有些处在孙子和孙女的位置上，等等。因此便有了这些良善和真理的血亲和姻亲关系，以及世系众多的家庭。<br />天堂的社群就是以这种秩序被排列的；因此，正在重生之人里面的真理和良善也是被如此排列的，这就是为何他也变成一个最小形式的天堂。此外（这是一个奥秘），人里面的良善和真理彼此相爱，并照着那爱而互相承认，由此结合在一起。这一切起源于天使社群，社群里的天使照其良善的相似和接近性而彼此相爱，互相承认，并结合在一起。令人惊奇的是，当那些处于相似良善的人走到一起时，即便他们从未谋面，却好像从小就见过彼此一样。正是出于这种起源，人里面的良善和真理才照着天堂的形式彼此结合，并在他里面产生一种天堂的形像。主是这一切的源头，无论是在天堂，还是在一个天使人里面，也就是在一个正在重生并变成一位天使的人里面。</p>

Whether he have struck with the horn a son, or struck with the horn a daughter. That this signifies an onset by the affection of evil against the truths and the goods of faith derived from things interior, 
is evident from the signification of "striking with the horn," as being to injure (n. 9065), thus an onset; and from the signification of "son," as being the truth of faith, and of "daughter," 
as being the good of faith (n. 489-491, 533, 1147, 2362, 2623). The reason why truths and goods derived from things interior are signified, is that interior things are like parents, from which goods and 
truths are born as sons and daughters. For with a regenerate man goods and truths are like generations; there are some which are in the place of a parent, some which are in the place of children, some 
which are in the place of sons-in-law and daughters-in-law, some which are in the place of grandsons and granddaughters, and so on. Consequently there are consanguinities and affinities of these goods 
and truths, and there are families in a manifold series. [2] The societies in heaven have been thus arranged, and also the truths and goods in the man who is being regenerated; consequently he too 
becomes a heaven in the least form; and (what is a secret) the goods and the truths in man mutually love each other, and recognize each other in accordance with the love, and thus consociate together. 
This has its origin from the angelic societies, in which they love each other, recognize each other, and consociate together, according to the likenesses and nearnesses of their goods; and, wonderful 
to say, when those meet who are in a like good, it is as if they had seen each other from childhood, even although they had never seen each other before. It is from this origin that goods and truths 
conjoin themselves in man according to the form of heaven, and make an image of heaven in him. But these things are of the Lord in both heaven and an angel man, that is, in a man who is being regenerated, 
and is becoming an angel. </p>

'Whether it strikes a son with its horn or strikes a daughter with its horn' means an assault made by an affection for evil on truths and forms of the good of faith that are derived from interior things. 
This is clear from the meaning of 'striking with the horn' as injuring, as above in <a href="9065.htm">9065</a>, thus an assault; and from the meaning of 'a son' as the truth of faith, and of 'a daughter' as the good of 
faith, dealt with in <a href="489.htm">489</a>-<a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="533.htm">533</a>, <a href="1147.htm">1147</a>, <a href="2362.htm">2362</a>, <a href="2623.htm">2623</a>. The reason why they are truths and forms of the good of faith which are derived from interior things is that interior things are like parents, from 
which forms of good and truths are born like sons and daughters. For the forms of good and the truths with a person who has been regenerated are interrelated like different generations. Some come in 
the parent's place, some in that of the children, some in that of the sons-in-law and daughters-in-law, some in that of the grandsons and granddaughters, and so on. They are interrelated therefore through 
blood relationships and relationships by marriage; and there are families of them with many lines of descent. </p>

 The communities of heaven are arranged in this kind of order; so too are the 
truths and forms of good with a person who is being regenerated, which also is why he becomes a heaven in miniature. Furthermore, and this is an arcanum, the forms of good and the truths with a person 
love one another, and in accordance with that love they acknowledge one another, and accordingly exist in association with one another. This has its origin among angelic communities, in which angels 
love one another, acknowledge one another, and live in association with one another, depending on how similar and close together their forms of good are. And what is amazing, when people governed by 
a similar good come together, even if they have never seen one another before, it is as though they have seen one another since early childhood. It is from this origin that the forms of good and the truths 
present with a person link themselves to one another according to the form heaven takes, producing a likeness of heaven in him. But the Lord is the source of all this, both in heaven and in an angelic 
person, that is, in a person who is being regenerated and becoming an angel. </p>

`Aut filium cornu ferierit, aut filiam cornu ferierit': quod significet insultum ab affectione mali in vera et bona fidei derivata ab interioribus, constat ex significatione `cornu ferire' quod sit 
laesio, ut supra n. 9065, ita {1} insultus, ex significatione filii quod sit verum fidei, et `filiae' quod sit bonum fidei, de qua n. 489-491, 533, 1147, 2362, (x)2623; quod sint vera et bona derivata 
ab interioribus, est quia interiora sunt sicut parentes, ex quibus bona et vera {2} nata sunt sicut filii (c)et filiae; bona enim et vera apud hominem regeneratum se habent sicut generationes; sunt quae 
parentis loco sunt, sunt quae liberorum, quae generorum ac nuruum, quae nepotum et neptum, et sic porro; sunt inde illorum consanguinitates et affinitates, et sunt familiae {3}, in multiplici serie; 
[2] ita dispositae sunt societates in caelo, ac ita quoque vera et bona apud hominem qui regeneratur, inde etiam is fit caelum in minima forma; et quod arcanum est, bona et vera apud hominem se mutuo 
amant, et secundum amorem se agnoscunt, ac ita se consociant; hoc {4} originem ducit ex societatibus angelicis, in quibus se amant, se agnoscunt, et se consociant, secundum bonorum similitudines et 
proximitates; et quod mirum, qui se nusquam prius viderant, si in (x)simili bono sunt cum conveniunt, est sicut se ab infantia viderint; ex hac origine est quod bona et vera se secundum caeli formam 
conjungant apud hominem, (c)et faciant instar caeli in illo; sed haec {5} a Domino, tam in caelo quam in homine angelo, hoc est, in homine qui regeneratur et fit angelus. @1 i quoque$ @2 vera et bona$ @3
