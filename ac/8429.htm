<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8429节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8429.</strong>“向耶和华所发，我们算什么，你们竟向我们发怨言呢”表这些报怨是向神性发的，而不是向那些代表神性的人发的。这从以下事实和“怨言”的含义清楚可知：“耶和华”表示神性，在此表示摩西和亚伦所代表的神性真理；“怨言”是指报怨，如刚才所述（<a href="8428.htm">8428</a>节）。由于经上说他们向耶和华，而不是摩西和亚伦发怨言，所以意思是说，他们向摩西和亚伦所代表的神性真理发怨言（<a href="8425.htm">8425</a>节），而不是向那些代表它的人发怨言。这也解释了为何下一节经文说：我们算什么，你们的怨言不是向我们发的。因为代表神性的人相对神性来说，什么也不是。此外，当进行代表的人代表神性说话时，那些向他发怨言的人不是向这个人发怨言，而是向神性发怨言。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8429</b></p><p><b>8429.</b>
Against Jehovah, and what are we that ye murmur against us? That this signifies that the complaints were against the Divine, and not against those who represented it, is evident from the fact that "Jehovah" 
denotes the Divine, here the Divine truth which Moses and Aaron represented; and from the signification of "murmuring," as being complaint (as just above, n. 8428). And as it is said that "they 
murmured against Jehovah and not against Moses and Aaron," there is signified that they murmured against Divine truth, which is represented by Moses and Aaron (n. 8425), and not against those who represent 
it; and therefore it is also said in the following verse, "What are we? your murmurings are not against us;" for the person who represents the Divine is relatively not anything. Moreover they 
who murmur against the person who represents, when he speaks from the Divine, do not murmur against the person, but against the Divine. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8429</b></p><p><b>8429.</b>
'Against Jehovah, and what are we, that you grumble against us?' means that they were made against the Divine, not against those who represented Him. This is clear from the consideration that 'Jehovah' 
is the Divine, at this point the Divine Truth, which Moses and Aaron represented; and from the meaning of 'grumbling' as complaint, as immediately above in <a href="8428.htm">8428</a>. And since it says that they grumbled 
against Jehovah, and not against Moses and Aaron, the meaning is that the complaints were made against Divine Truth, which Moses and Aaron represented, <a href="8425.htm">8425</a>, and not against those who represented it. 
This also explains why the next verse says, What are we? your grumblings are not against us. For a person who represents the Divine is nothing in comparison with Him. Furthermore those grumbling against 
a representative person, when he speaks on behalf of the Divine, are not grumbling against the person but against the Divine. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 8429</b>
</p><b>8429.</b>
`Contra Jehovam, et nos quid quod murmuretis contra nos?' quod significet quod illae fuerint contra Divinum, non contra illos qui Id repraesentabant, constat ex eo quod `Jehovah' sit Divinum, hic Divinum 
Verum, quod Moscheh et Aharon repraesentabant, et ex significatione `murmurare' quod sit querimonia, ut nunc supra n. 8428; et quia dicitur quod murmuraverint contra Jehovam, et non contra Moschen 
et Aharonem, significatur quod contra Divinum Verum, quod per Moschen et Aharonem repraesentatur, n. 8425, et non contra illos qui repraesentant; quare etiam dicitur in versu sequente, `Nos quid? non 
contra nos murmurationes vestrae'; nam persona quae Divinum repraesentat respective non est aliquid; praeterea qui {1}murmurant contra personam quae repraesentat, cum ex Divino loquitur, non contra 
personam sed contra Divinum {1}murmurant. 	@1 murmurat$ </p>
