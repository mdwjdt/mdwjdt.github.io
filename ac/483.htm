<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第483节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>483.</strong>接下来的名字，即塞特、以挪士、该南、玛勒列、雅列、以诺、玛土撒拉、拉麦和挪亚，表示众多教会，其中第一个，也是最主要的一个被称为人。这些教会的主要特征是直觉，因此这个时期的教会之间的区别主要是直觉。关于直觉的问题，这里要提到的是，整个天堂，除了对善与真的直觉外，没有别的东西。直觉的性质难以描述，并且包含了数不清的差异，以至于没有哪两个社群的直觉是相同的。直觉也分为属和种。这些属数不胜数，每一属里的种也是如此。蒙主怜悯，这些事物容后再述。既然有数不清的属，每一属里面又有数不清的种，甚至每一种下面还有更数不清的亚种，那么显而易见，当今世界对属天属灵之事知道的何其少，他们甚至不知何为直觉，即使被告知，也不相信它的存在。其它事也是一样。<br />上古教会代表主的属天王国，在直觉的属与种的各自变化方面也是。但由于如今没人知道何为直觉，甚至不知其最普通的一面，所以若陈述这些教会直觉的属与种，必然显得奇怪和毫无意义。那时，他们分为家、族、国，习惯在各自家、族内通婚，以便直觉的属和种能够存在，并从父母获得，犹如天生性情的复制。这也是为什么上古教会成员一起居于天堂。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]483.</strong> The names that follow — Seth, Enosh, Kenan, Mahalalel, Jared, Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech, Noah — symbolize so many churches, of which the first and most important was the one called the human.<br />For these churches, the most important attribute was perception, so the main distinctions among them in that era were differences in perception.<br />Concerning perception, let me mention that throughout heaven the perception of goodness and truth alone holds sway. Its nature is such that it can never be described, and it comes in so many different varieties that not one community has the same kind as another. There are general categories and specific kinds of perception in heaven, and the number of general categories cannot be counted; likewise the specific kinds within each category. Both will be discussed later [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_483/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1383" target=_top>1383-1400</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_483/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1504" target=_top>1504-1520</a>], with the Lord's divine mercy.<br />In the face of countless general categories, countless specific kinds within each category, and still more uncountable varieties within each kind, it is evident how little the world today knows about heavenly and spiritual matters. Its knowledge is so scant as to amount to almost nothing, since it does not even know what perception is and, if told, does not believe that such a thing exists. It is equally ignorant in other areas.<br />[2] The earliest church represented the Lord's heavenly kingdom in respect to the various genera and species of perception. But in view of today's thorough ignorance of what perception is, even in its broadest outlines, to recount the categories and types of perception in those churches would be to purvey nothing but the strange and unheard-of.<br />The people of those churches were divided into households, clans, and nations and contracted marriage within the household or clan for a reason. The reason was to preserve the different categories and types of perception and to transmit them exclusively by reproducing the character of the parents in their children. As a result, those who were part of the earliest church also live together in heaven. </p>

By the names which follow: "Seth" "Enosh" "Kenan" "Mahalalel" "Jared" "Enoch" "Methuselah" "Lamech" "Noah" are signified so many churches, of which the first and principal was called "Man." The chief 
characteristic of these churches was perception, wherefore the differences of the churches of that time were chiefly differences of perception. I may here mention concerning perception, that in the universal 
heaven there reigns nothing but a perception of good and truth, which is such as cannot be described, with innumerable differences, so that no two societies enjoy similar perception; the perceptions 
there existing are distinguished into genera and species, and the genera are innumerable, and the species of each genus are likewise innumerable; but concerning these, of the Lord's Divine mercy 
hereafter. Since then there are innumerable genera, and innumerable species in each genus, and still more innumerable varieties in the species, it is evident how little-so little that it is almost 
nothing the world at this day knows concerning things celestial and spiritual, since they do not know even what perception is, and if they are told, they do not believe that any such thing exists; and 
so with other things also. The Most Ancient Church represented the celestial kingdom of the Lord, even as to the generic and specific differences of perception; but whereas the nature of perception, 
even in its most general aspect, is at this day utterly unknown, any account of the genera and species of the perceptions of these churches would necessarily appear dark and strange. They were at that 
time distinguished into houses, families, and nations, and contracted marriage within their houses and families, in order that genera and species of perceptions might exist, and be derived from the parents 
precisely as are the propagations of native character; wherefore those who were of the Most Ancient Church dwell together in heaven. </p>

The names which follow - Seth, Enosh, Kenan, Mahalalel, Jared, Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech, and Noah - mean just so many Churches, the first and chief one of which was called Man. The chief characteristic 
of these Churches was perception, and therefore the differences between the Churches of that period were primarily differences in perception. On the subject of perception, let it be mentioned here 
that nothing else reigns in the whole of heaven but the perception of good and truth. Its nature defies description, and includes differences so countless that no one community's perception is exactly 
like that found in another. Perceptions there fall into genera and species. Those genera are countless, and so too are the species within every genus. These in the Lord's Divine mercy will be dealt 
with later on. Since there are countless genera, and countless species within every genus, and even more countless sub-species to each species, it becomes clear how very little indeed the world of today 
knows about celestial and spiritual matters. It does not even know what perception is, and if told, it does not believe that it even exists. The same applies to other matters too.  </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The Most 
Ancient Church represented the Lord's celestial kingdom, even as to each variation of perception in its genus and species. But because nobody nowadays knows what perception is, not even the most general 
aspect of it, facts of a wholly strange and meaningless nature would therefore be imparted if the genera and species of the perceptions of those Churches were stated. They were divided into houses, 
families, and nations, and used to contract marriages within their own houses and families, in order that genera and species of perception might be established and be derived from parents altogether 
as reproductions of innate dispositions. This also is why members of the Most Ancient Church dwell together in heaven.  </p>

Per nomina quae sequuntur, ut per Sheth, Enosh, Kenan, Mahalalel, Jared, Hanoch, Methushelah, Lamech, Noah, significantur totidem Ecclesiae quarum prima et principalis fuit quae 'Homo' dicta. Ecclesiarum 
principale fuit perceptio; quare differentiae Ecclesiarum istius temporis imprimis fuerunt differentiae perceptionum.  De perceptione hic licet memorare, quod in universo caelo non nisi quam perceptio 
boni et veri regnet, et talis ut describi nequeat, cum differentia innumerabili, adeo ut una societas non similem perceptionem habeat ac altera; perceptionum ibi dantur genera et species, et genera 
sunt innumerabilia, et cujusvis generis species similiter innumerabiles, de quibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus. Cum innumerabilia genera, et cujusvis' generis innumerabiles species, 
et innumerabiliora adhuc specierum partialia dentur, constare potest quam parum ut sit paene nihil, hodie orbis sciat de caelestibus et spiritualibus, cum ne quidem sciat quid perceptio, et si dicitur, 
nec credat quod sit; ita quoque in aliis.  [2] Ecclesia Antiquissima repraesentabat caeleste Domini regnum, etiam quoad differentias genericas et speciales perceptionum; sed quia perceptio quid 
sit, in communissimo suo hodie prorsus nescitur, quare si perceptionum genera et species harum Ecclesiarum dicerentur, nihil nisi quam peregrina et ignota traderentur: in domos, familias et gentes ideo 
distincti fuerunt, et intra domos et familias contrahebant matrimonia, ob causam ut genera et species perceptionum existerent, et non aliter quam secundum propagationes indolum a parentibus derivarentur; 
quare qui ab Antiquissima Ecclesia fuerunt, etiam in caelo cohabitant. </p>
