<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5804节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5804.</strong>“还有他老年所生的一个孩子，是最小的”表源于那良善的新真理。这从便雅悯的代表和“老年”的含义清楚可知：便雅悯，即此处的“孩子，最小的”，是指真理，如前所述（<a href="5801.htm">5801</a>节），“孩子”或“儿子”也表示真理（参看<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>，<a href="2623.htm">2623</a>，<a href="3373.htm">3373</a>节）；“老年”是指生命的新样（参看<a href="3492.htm">3492</a>，<a href="4220.htm">4220</a>，<a href="4676.htm">4676</a>节）。由此明显可知，“老年的一个孩子，是最小的”表示新的真理。此中情形是这样：正在重生、变得属灵的人首先通过真理被引入良善；因为若不通过真理，或取自圣言的教义，人就不知道何为属灵的良善，或也可说，何为基督的良善。这就是他被引入良善的方式。此后，当被引入良善时，他就不再通过真理被引入良善，而是通过良善被引入真理，因为此时，他不仅从良善看见他以前不知道的真理，还从良善提出他以前不知道，也不可能知道的新真理。事实上，良善含有对真理的渴望在自己里面，因为良善可以说被这些真理滋养；它们使良善更完美。这些新真理与他以前所知道的真理大不相同，因为他以前所知道的真理只有极少的生命在里面，而他后来所领受的真理拥有来自良善的生命。<br />一旦人通过真理来到良善这里，他就是“以色列”；此时，他从良善，也就是经由良善从主所领受的真理是由与父亲同在时的便雅悯所代表的新真理。良善通过这真理而在属世层中结出果实，产生无数含有良善在里面的真理。属世层便以这种方式重生，通过结实首先变得像一棵结好果子的树，然后逐渐变得像花园。由此明显可知源于属灵良善的新真理是什么意思。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5804</b></p><p><b>5804.</b>
And a child of his old age, the youngest. That this signifies truth therefrom which is new, is evident from the representation of Benjamin, who is here the "child, the youngest," as being truth (of which 
above, n. 5801; as also that a "child" or "son" is truth, n. 489, 491, 1147, 2623, 3373); and from the signification of "old age," as being newness of life (see n. 3492, 4220, 4676). Hence it is 
plain that by a "child of old ages, the youngest," is signified truth which is new. The case herein is this. The man who is being regenerated and becoming spiritual is first led to good by means of truth; 
for man does not know what spiritual good, or what is the same thing, Christian good is, except through truth or through doctrine drawn from the Word. In this way he is initiated into good. Afterward, 
when he has been initiated, he no longer is led to good through truth, but to truth through good, for he then not only sees from good the truths which he knew before, but also from good brings forth 
new truths which he did not and could not know before; for good is attended with a longing for truths, because with these it is, as it were, nourished, it being perfected by them. These new truths 
differ greatly from the truths which he had previously known; for those which he then knew had but little life, while those which he now acquires have life from good. [2] When a man has come to good 
by means of truth, he is "Israel;" and the truth which he then receives from good, that is, through good from the Lord, is new truth, which is represented by Benjamin while he was with his father. By 
means of this truth good becomes fruitful in the natural, and brings forth numberless truths wherein is good. In this way the natural is regenerated, and through fruitfulness first becomes like a tree 
with good fruits, and successively like a garden. From all this it is evident what is meant by new truth from spiritual good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5804</b></p><p><b>5804.</b>
'And a child of his old age, the youngest one' means truth that is new, springing from that good. This is clear from the representation of Benjamin, to whom 'a child, the youngest one' refers here, as 
truth, dealt with above in <a href="5801.htm">5801</a>, in addition to which 'child' or 'son' means truth, see <a href="489.htm">489</a>, <a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="1147.htm">1147</a>, <a href="1623.htm">1623</a>, <a href="3373.htm">3373</a>; and from the meaning of 'old age' as newness of life, dealt with in <a href="3492.htm">3492</a>, <a href="4620.htm">4620</a>, <a href="4676.htm">4676</a>. 
From this it is evident that 'a child of his old age, the youngest one' means truth that is new. The implications of this are as follows: A person who is being regenerated and becoming spiritual is 
led initially by means of truth to good; for a person does not know what spiritual good is, or what amounts to the same, what Christian good is, except through truth, that is, through teaching drawn 
from the Word. This is the way he is introduced into good. After that, once he has been introduced into it, he is led no longer by means of truth to good, but by means of good to truth; for at this point 
good not only enables him to see the truths he knew previously but also brings forth new ones he did not and could not know previously. Good holds the desire for truths within itself because it is 
so to speak nourished by them; indeed they make it more perfect. These truths - the new ones - are very different from the truths he knew before; for the truths he knew before possessed little life 
in them. But those which he receives afterwards possess life coming from good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Once a person has by means of truth arrived at good he is 'Israel', and the truth which he now receives from good, 
that is, from the Lord through good, is the new truth that 'Benjamin' represented all the time he was with his father. By means of this truth good in the natural bears fruit, bringing forth countless 
truths that hold good within them. This is the way the regeneration of the natural proceeds, becoming by its fruitfulness first of all like a tree with good fruit on it and then gradually like a garden. 
All this shows what is meant by new truth springing from spiritual good. </p>

`Et natus senectutum minimus': quod significet inde verum quod novum, constat ex repraesentatione `Benjaminis' qui hic est `natus minimus', quod sit verum, de qua supra n. 5801; quod etiam `natus seu 
filius' sit verum, videatur n. 489, 491, 1147, (x)2623, 3373; et ex significatione `senectutis' quod sit novum vitae, de qua n. 3492, 4620, 4676; inde patet quod per `natum senectutum minimum' significetur 
verum quod novum. Cum hoc ita se habet: homo qui regeneratur et fit spiritualis, is primum per verum ad bonum {1}ducitur, non enim scit homo quid bonum spirituale, seu quod idem, bonum Christianum, 
nisi per verum, seu per doctrinale quod ex Verbo; ita initiatur in bonum; postea cum initiatus est {2}, non amplius per verum ducitur ad bonum, sed per bonum ad verum, {3}nam tunc ex bono non modo 
videt vera quae prius sciverat, sed etiam ex bono producit nova quae non prius sciverat nec scire potuerat; bonum enim secum habet quod desideret vera, his enim quasi nutritur, nam perficitur ab illis; 
{4}haec vera seu vera nova, multum differunt a veris quae antea sciverat, nam quae antea sciverat, parum vitae {5}habuerunt, at quae dein accipit, ex bono vitam habent'. [2] Cum homo ad bonum per 
verum venerat, tunc est `Israel', et verum quod tunc ex bono, hoc est, per bonum a Domino accipit, est verum novum quod repraesentatur per Benjaminem' quamdiu is erat apud patrem suum. Per hoc verum 
fructificat se bonum in naturali, et producit vera in quibus bonum, innumerabilia; ita regeneratur naturale, et fit per fructificationem primum sicut arbor cum fructibus bonis, et successive sicut hortus. 
Ex his patet quid intelligitur per verum novum ex bono spirituali. @1 after primum$ @2 i in bonum$ @3 et$ @4 inde ei vera, quae nova et ex bono vitam habent, haec vera$ @5 habuerant$ </p>
