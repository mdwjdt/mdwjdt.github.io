<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6471节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6471.</strong>有一个灵人并不是恶灵，而是那些以为他们在信的事物上比别人拥有更大知识的人之一；他曾教导过许多人，甚至教导过这一事实：一切良善与真理皆来自主，人凭自己无法思考或意愿任何良善。这个灵人被带入这样的状态：他没有始于他自己的思维或意愿；因为在来世，人们能被带入此类状态。当处于这种状态时，他说，他无法以这种方式生活；对他来说，这种生活是压抑的。此时，他被告知，他并非真的喜欢活在他曾教导过的真理中；而天使则处于这种状态，并且当发觉他们不能凭自己生活时，就充满幸福。但告诉他的话对他不起作用。由此明显可知，过一种信仰的生活何等困难，除非此人活在仁之良善中。</p>

A certain spirit (not of the evil, but from those who supposed that they possessed the knowledges of faith more than others, and who had instructed some others even in the fact that all good and truth 
are from the Lord, and that man cannot think or will what is good from himself), was brought into such a state that he did not think and will from himself; for in the other life it is possible to be 
brought into such states. When he was in this state he said that he could not live in such a way; but that life was grievous to him. He was then told that he did not love to live in the truth which he 
had taught, and that the angels are in that state, and are in happiness when they perceive that they do not live from themselves; but this was of no avail. Hence it was evident how difficult it is to 
live a life of faith unless the man lives in the good of charity. </p>

There was a certain spirit, not an evil spirit but one of those who imagined that they had greater knowledge than others about matters of faith, and who instructed many others, even in the knowledge 
that everything good and true comes from the Lord and that man cannot by himself think or will anything good. This spirit was brought into the state in which he had no thought or will that began in himself; 
for in the next life people can be brought into states such as this. While in that state he said that he was unable to live in that condition and that for him life was oppressive. He was told at 
this point that this showed that he did not like living in obedience to the truth he had taught, that this state was the one angels lived in, and that they were filled with happiness when they lived 
that their life did not begin in themselves. But what he was told made no difference to him. This proved how difficult it is to lead the life of faith unless the good of charity plays its part in that life.  </p>

</p><b>6471.</b>
(s)  Quidam spiritus non ex malis, sed ab illis qui cognitiones fidei prae aliis se habere putarunt, et qui plures alios instruxerunt, etiam in eo quod omne bonum et verum a Domino, et quod homo non cogitare 
nec velle bonum possit a se; is perductus est in eum statum ut ex se non cogitaret et vellet, nam in tales status in altera vita perduci possunt; in eo statu cum esset, dicebat quod sic vivere 
non (x)posset sed quod vita ei gravis sit; ei dictum est tunc quod sic non amaverit vivere in veritate quam docuerat, et quod angeli in eo statu sint, et {1}tunc in felicitate cum percipiunt non vivere 
ex se; sed hoc nihil valebat; inde constabat quam difficile sit vivere vitam fidei, nisi vivatur in bono charitatis. @1 i quod$ @2 i sit $ </p>
