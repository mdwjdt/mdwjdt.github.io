<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1486.</strong>“亚伯兰得了许多牛羊、公驴、男仆、女仆、母驴、骆驼”表总体上属于知识的一切事物。这从圣言中所有这些事物的含义清楚可知。不过，要说明各自的具体含义，如“牛羊”、“公驴和男仆”、“母驴和女仆”、“骆驼”等，会占用大量篇幅。它们各自都有自己特有的含义，但总体上表示属于认知构成的知识的所有事物，以及构成记忆知识的所有事物。就它们本身而言，知识是“公驴和男仆”；它们的乐趣是“母驴和女仆”；“骆驼”是一般的服务事物；“牛羊”是财物。这在整部圣言都是通用的。凡居于外在人中的所有事物无非是服务的事物，即它们用来服务内在人。一切唯独属外在人的知识都是如此，因为它们是藉着感官印象通过尘世万物获得的，以便它们可以服务于内在人或理性人；而这内在人可以服务于属灵人，属灵人可以服务于属天人，属天人则可以服务于主。因此，它们彼此从属，就象外在事物在内在事物之下那样；每一个事物也因此从属于主。所以，知识是最终极和最外在的事物，更为内在的事物照其秩序而被包裹于其中；因为知识是最终极和最外在的事物，所以比起所有其它事物，它们必然更是属于服务的事物。若反思并追问自己，这种知识究竟有什么用？谁都能清醒地认识到，它们能起到服务的作用。当以这种方式反思它们所起的作用时，他还会领悟到这作用的性质。一切知识必都是为了某种作用而存在，这就是它的服务。<br />1486a.创世记12:17. 耶和华因亚伯兰妻子撒莱的缘故，降大灾与法老和他的全家。<br />“耶和华降大灾与法老”表记忆的知识被摧毁。“他的全家”表祂已收聚之物。“因亚伯兰妻子撒莱”表因要与属天之物联结的真理。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1486.</strong> The fact that and flock and herd, and male donkeys and male servants, and female servants and female donkeys, and camels, symbolize all the general categories of fact can be seen from the symbolism of all these in the Word. It would take too long to demonstrate the specific symbolism of each, though 钬?of flock and herd, of male donkeys and male servants, of female servants and female donkeys, and of camels.{*1} Each has its own symbolism. As a group, they symbolize all facets of the study of religious knowledge and secular fact. Facts, viewed in themselves, are the male donkeys and servants. The satisfaction they yield are the female servants and donkeys. The camels are general knowledge whose purpose is to serve. The flock and herd are what we possess. And this applies throughout the Word.<br />Nothing whatever in our outer self is anything but a servant; it exists only to serve our inner self. This is true of all the facts we know, since they belong exclusively to our outer self. After all, they have been collected from earthly and worldly sources through our senses in order to serve our intermediate or rational self, so that this can serve our spiritual self, so that this can serve our heavenly self, so that this can serve the Lord. So they arrange themselves in subordination to one another, the most outward elements ranking below the more inward ones in succession and therefore each and every one of them in order below the Lord.<br />Facts, as a result, are the final foundation on which the inner layers rest in sequence. And as they are the final foundation, they are inherently more subservient than the other levels. Anyone can see what role facts are capable of filling; all you have to do is reflect on it, or ask yourself what use they are. When you ponder their function in this way, you can grasp what the quality of that function is. Every bit of factual information has to exist for some purpose, and this is the service it performs.<br />[2] <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1486/bible_king-james-version_genesis_12_17" target=_top>Genesis 12:17</a>. And Jehovah struck Pharaoh 钬?and his household 钬?with great plagues because of this word of Sarai, Abram's wife.<br />Jehovah struck Pharaoh with great plagues means that facts were destroyed. And his household symbolizes the facts he had collected. Because of this word of Sarai, Abram's wife, means because truth needs to be connected with something heavenly.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For more details elsewhere on the symbolism of flocks and herds, see 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1486/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1565" target=_top>1565</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1486/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_10609" target=_top>10609</a>; of donkeys, 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1486/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2781" target=_top>2781</a>; of servants, or slaves, 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1486/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2567" target=_top>2567</a>; of camels, 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1486/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3048" target=_top>3048</a>.

And he had flock and herd, and he-asses and menservants, and maidservants and she-asses, and camels. That these words signify all things in general that belong to memory knowledges, is evident from the 
signification of all these things in the Word. But it would be too tedious to show what is signified by each in particular, as what by the "flock and herd," the "he-asses and menservants," the "maidservants 
and she-asses," and the "camels." Each has its own peculiar signification. In general they signify all things that belong to the memory-knowledge of knowledges, and to memory-knowledges. Regarded 
in themselves, memory-knowledges are "he-asses and menservants;" their pleasures are "maidservants and she-asses;" "camels" are general things of service; "flock and herd" are possessions; and so 
in the Word throughout. All things whatever that are in the external man, are nothing but things of service, that is, they are for the service of the internal man. So it is with all memory-knowledges, 
which belong solely to the external man; for they are procured from earthly and worldly things by means of sensuous impressions, in order that they may serve the interior or rational man, and this 
the spiritual man, this the celestial, and this the Lord. Thus are they subordinated one to another, as are the more external things to the more internal, in their order; and thus all things whatever, 
both in general and in particular, are, in their order, subordinated to the Lord. Memory-knowledges are therefore the lowest and outermost things, in which are terminated in their order the things that 
are more interior; and because they are the lowest and outermost things, they must be pre-eminently things of service. Everyone may know for what such knowledges may be serviceable, if he reflects 
or inquires in himself for what use they are; and when he is thus reflecting upon their use, he can also apprehend the quality of the use. Every memory-knowledge must be for the sake of some use, and 
this is its service.      Verse 17. And Jehovah smote Pharaoh with great plagues, and his house, because of the word of Sarai, Abram's wife. "Jehovah smote Pharaoh with great plagues," signifies that 
the memory-knowledges were destroyed; "and his house," signifies which He had collected; "because of the word of Sarai, Abram's wife," signifies because of the truth that was to be adjoined to the celestial. </p>

'And [he had] flocks and herds, and asses and menservants, and maidservants and she-asses, and camels' means all things in general which constitute factual knowledge. This is clear from the meaning of 
all of these in the Word. But what each one means specifically would take far too long to show, that is, to show what is meant by flocks and herds, what by asses and menservants, what by maidservants 
and she-asses, and what by camels. Each has its own particular meaning, but in general they mean all the things constituting the knowledge that is comprised of cognitions and all those constituting 
factual knowledge. Regarded in themselves facts are 'asses and menservants'; the pleasures that go with them are 'maidservants and she-asses'; 'camels' are general things of service; 'flocks and herds' 
are possessions. This applies throughout the Word. All things whatever residing with the external man are nothing else than a body of servants, that is, they exist to serve the internal man. This is 
how it is with all facts, which belong solely to the external man; for these are acquired from earthly and worldly things by means of sensory impressions so that they might serve the interior or rational 
man; and that this interior man might serve the spiritual man, the spiritual man the celestial man, and the celestial man the Lord. Thus these exist in subordination to one another as things that 
are exterior beneath those that are interior; and thus also every single thing exists subordinate to the Lord. Facts therefore are the ultimate and outermost things, in which in their order interior 
things are inclosed; and because facts are ultimate and outermost things, these more than all other things must be things of service. Anyone may recognize what it is that facts are able to serve if he 
reflects or asks himself the question, What is their use? When he reflects in this way on the use they serve he may also apprehend the nature of the use. Every fact must exist for the sake of a use, 
and this is its service. </p>

'Et grex et armentum, et asini et servi, et ancillae et asinae, et cameli': quod significent omnia in genere quae sunt scientificorum, constat a significatione omnium horum in Verbo; sed quid unumquodvis 
in specie significat, prolixum nimis foret ostendere, ut quid hic grex et armentum, quid asini et servi, quid ancillae et asinae, quid cameli; quodlibet suam peculiarem significationem habet, in 
genere omnia quae sunt scientiae cognitionum, et scientificorum; scientifica in se spectata sunt 'asini et servi,' eorum voluptates sunt 'ancillae et asinae,' 'cameli' sunt servitia communia, 'grex et 
armentum' sunt possessiones, ita passim in Verbo.  Omnia quaecumque apud externum hominem sunt, non sunt aliud quam servitia, hoc est, ut inserviant interno homini; ita omnia scientifica, quae non sunt 
nisi quam externi hominis; sunt enim comparata ex terrestribus et mundanis per sensualia ut inservire possent interiori seu rationali homini, hic spirituali, et hic caelesti, et hic Domino; ita sibi 
mutuo subordinata sunt ut exteriora interioribus ordine, ita omnia et singula secundum ordinem Domino: scientifica itaque sunt ultima et extima, in quibus terminantur ordine interiora, quae quia ultima 
et extima, prae ceteris erunt servitia; quisque scire potest ad quae scientifica inservire possint, si reflectat, aut apud se quaerat, cui usui; cum sic reflectit super usum, capere etiam potest 
qualis usus; omne scientificum erit propter usum, et hoc est servitium ejus. 	Vers. 17.  Et percussit Jehovah Pharaonem plagis magnis, et domum ejus, propter verbum Sarai, uxoris Abrami. 'Percussit Jehovah 
Pharaonem plagis magnis' significat quod destructa sint scientifica: 'et domum ejus' significat quae collegit: 'propter verbum Sarai, uxoris Abrami' significat propter verum adjungendum caelesti. </p>
