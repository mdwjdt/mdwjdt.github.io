<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3353节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">第26章</h4><br />关于最后的审判<br />3353.绝大多数人以为当最后审判到来时，可见世界的一切事物都将毁灭；大地被火吞噬；太阳和月亮解体，化为乌有；众星都将消失不见；然后，一个新天新地将会诞生。他们的这种观点是从预言的启示中得来的，其中便提到了这种事。但从关于最后审判的说明（<a href="900.htm">900</a>，<a href="931.htm">931</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>-<a href="2133.htm">2133</a>节）可以看出，情况根本不是这样。从这些说明清楚可知，最后审判无非是教会在一群人当中的结束和在另一群人当中的开始。当主不再得到承认，或也可说，信不复存在时，这一个的结束和那一个的开始就发生了。当仁不复存在时，承认或信也就是不复存在了，因为信只能存在于那些处于仁爱的人身上。在这种时候，教会就会走向终结，转到其他人那里。这从主自己在福音书中关于末日或今世的终结所教导和预言的一切事（马太福音24，马可福音13，路加福音21）很明显地看出来。<br />没有钥匙，没有人能明白主在那里所预言的这些事，故我会依次解释包含在它们里面的事，就从此处马太福音中的这些话开始：<br />耶稣在橄榄山上坐着，门徒暗暗地上他跟前来，说，请告诉我们，什么时候有这些事？你降临和今世的完结，有什么预兆呢？耶稣回答他们说，你们要谨慎，免得有人迷惑你们。因为将来有好些人冒我的名来，说，我是基督，并且要迷惑许多人。你们也要听见打仗和打仗的风声，总不要惊慌，因为这些事是必须有的，只是末期还没有到。民族要起来攻打民族，国家要起来攻打国家，多处必有饥荒、瘟疫和地震。这一切事却只是灾难的起头。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.3.htm">24:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.8.htm">8</a>）<br />那些拘守于字义的人不可能知道这些以及本章接下来的话是指着耶路撒冷的毁灭和犹太民族的分散说的，还是指着那些日子的末了，也就是所谓的最后审判说的。但那些被允许进入内义的人能清楚看出，此处论述的是教会的结束，这种结束就是那在此处以及别处被称为主的到来和今世完结或世代末了的。由于所表示的是教会的结束，故可知，主所说的所有这些话都是指与教会相关的事。它们整体上的意思可从下面每句话的具体内义看出来，如经上说：“将来有好些人冒我的名来，说，我是基督，并且要迷惑许多人”，此处“名”不是指名字，“基督”也不是指基督，“名”表示藉以敬拜主之物（<a href="2724.htm">2724</a>，<a href="3006.htm">3006</a>节）；“基督”表真理本身（<a href="3009.htm">3009</a>，<a href="3010.htm">3010</a>节）。因此，这句话的意思是，那些声称这就是信的全部和实质，也就是说，这就是真理，而事实上这既不是信的全部和实质，也不是真理，而是虚假之人将要来。他们“要听见打仗和打仗的风声”表关于真理的争论和冲突会产生，这就是属灵意义上的打仗或战争。“民族要起来攻打民族，国家要起来攻打国家”表邪恶与邪恶交战，虚假与虚假交战。“民族”表良善，但在反面意义上表邪恶（参看<a href="1259.htm">1259</a>，<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>，<a href="1416.htm">1416</a>，<a href="1849.htm">1849</a>节）；“国家”表真理，但在反面意义上表虚假（<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="2547.htm">2547</a>节）。“多处必有饥荒、瘟疫和地震”表不再有对良善与真理的认知，因而教会的状态会发生变化，这就是“地震”。</p>

CHAPTER 26 Most men believe that when the Last Judgment comes, all things in the visible world will be destroyed; that the earth will be consumed by fire; the sun and the moon dissipated; that the stars 
will vanish away; and that a new heaven and a new earth will afterwards arise. They have conceived this opinion from the prophetic revelations in which such things are mentioned. But that the case 
is very different may be seen from what has been shown above concerning the Last Judgment (n. 900, 931, 1850, 2117-2133); from which it is manifest that the Last Judgment is nothing else than the end 
of the church with one nation, and its beginning with another, which end and beginning occur when there is no longer any acknowledgment of the Lord, or what is the same, when there is no faith. There 
is no acknowledgment, or no faith, when there is no charity; for faith is impossible except with those who are in charity. That at such a time there is an end of the church, and a transference of it 
to others, is plainly evident from all the things the Lord Himself taught and foretold in the Evangelists concerning that last day, or consummation of the age (Matt. 24, Mark 13, and Luke 21). [2] But 
as these passages cannot be comprehended by anyone without the key, which is the internal sense, I may unfold in regular order the things contained in them, beginning here with these words in Matthew: </p>
<p> 
    The disciples came unto Him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? And what shall be the sign of Thy coming, and of the consummation of the age? And Jesus answered and said 
unto them, See that no man lead you astray. For many shall come in My name, saying, I am the Christ; and shall lead many astray. And ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that ye be not troubled; 
for these things must needs come to pass; but the end is not yet. For nation shall be stirred up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes 
in diverse places. But all these things are the beginning of sorrows (Matt. 24:3-8). It is impossible for those who remain in the sense of the letter to know whether these things and those which 
follow in the chapter were spoken concerning the destruction of Jerusalem and the dispersion of the Jewish nation, or concerning the end of days, called the Last Judgment; but they who are in the internal 
sense see clearly that the end of the church is here treated of, which end is what is here and elsewhere called the coming of the Lord and the consummation of the age. And because this is the 
end which is meant, it may be known that all these expressions signify things of the church; but what they signify may appear from the several particulars in the internal sense, as when it is said that 
"many shall come in My name, saying, I am the Christ; and shall lead many astray," where "name" does not signify name, nor "Christ," Christ; but "name" signifies that by which the Lord is worshiped 
(n. 2724, 3006); and "Christ" signifies truth itself (n. 3009, 3010); thus it is meant that there would come those who would say, "This is of faith," or "This is true," when yet it is neither of faith, 
nor true, but false. That they "should hear of wars and rumors of wars" denotes that there would be disputes and strife concerning truths, which are wars in the spiritual sense. That "nation should 
be stirred up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom" signifies that evil would fight with evil, and falsity with falsity. (That "nation" signifies good, but in the opposite sense evil, may be seen 
above, n. 1259, 1260, 1416, 1849; and also that "kingdom" signifies truth, but in the opposite sense falsity, n. 1672, 2547.) "And there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes in diverse 
places" signifies that there would be no longer any knowledges of good and of truth, and thus that the state of the church would be changed, which is an "earthquake." </p>

The majority of people believe that when the Last Judgement comes everything visible in the world is going to perish - that is to say, the earth will go up in flames, the sun and moon will be reduced 
to nothing, and the stars will disappear; and after that a new heaven and a new earth will come into being. They have acquired this idea from the prophetical revelations, among which such occurrences 
are mentioned. But what will in fact happen at that time is quite different, as becomes clear from what has been shown already concerning the Last Judgement in <a href="900.htm">900</a>, <a href="931.htm">931</a>, <a href="1850.htm">1850</a>, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>-<a href="2133.htm">2133</a>. Those paragraphs 
show that the Last Judgement is nothing else than the end of the Church with one group of people and the beginning of it with another. This end with one and beginning with another occurs when the 
Lord is not acknowledged any longer, or what amounts to the same, when there is no faith any longer. No acknowledgement or faith exists any longer when there is no charity any longer, for faith is in 
no way possible except with those in whom charity is present. In those circumstances the Church comes to an end and is transferred to others, as is plainly evident from all the things that the Lord Himself 
taught and foretold in the Gospels concerning the last day or the close of the age - in Matthew <a href="24.htm">24</a>; Mark <a href="13.htm">13</a>; and Luke <a href="21.htm">21</a>. But since nobody without the key, which is the internal sense, is able 
to understand those things foretold by Him there, let them be explained one after another. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Here first let the following words be explained which appear in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
The disciples came to Jesus, 
saying, Tell us. when will those things take place, and what will be the sign of Your coming and of the close of the age? And Jesus answering said to them, See that no one leads you astray, for many 
will come in My name, saying, I am the Christ; and they will lead many astray. But when you hear of wars and rumours of wars, see that you are not alarmed; for all things must take place; but the end 
is not yet. For nation will be roused against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines, and plagues, and earthquakes in various places. All these are but the beginning of sorrows. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2024:3-8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 24:3-8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Those who confine themselves to the sense of the letter cannot know whether these words and those that follow in this chapter refer to the destruction of Jerusalem and the dispersion 
of the Jews, or whether they refer to the end of days which is called the Last Judgement. But those admitted into the internal sense see clearly that the end of the Church is being referred to, this 
end being that which here and in other places is called 'the coming of the Lord' and 'the close of the age'. And inasmuch as the end of the Church is meant one is able to see that all these statements 
made by the Lord mean such things as have to do with the Church. But their overall meaning may be seen from the individual meaning below which each of them has in the internal sense. </p>
<p>Many will come 
in My name, saying, I am the Christ; and they will lead many astray. 'Name' here does not mean name, nor 'the Christ' the Christ, but 'name' means that by which the Lord is worshipped, <a href="2724.htm">2724</a>, <a href="3006.htm">3006</a>, 
while 'the Christ' means truth itself, <a href="3009.htm">3009</a>, <a href="3010.htm">3010</a>. Thus the meaning is that people will come who say that this is the sum and substance of faith, that is, it is the truth, when in fact it is neither 
the sum and substance of faith, nor the truth, but falsity. </p>
<p>They will hear of wars and rumours of wars means that arguments and disagreements over truths will arise which are wars in the spiritual 
sense. </p>
<p>Nation will be roused against nation and kingdom against kingdom means that evil will conflict with evil, and falsity with falsity, 'nation' meaning good, but in the contrary sense evil, see <a href="1259.htm">1259</a>, <a href="1260.htm">1260</a>, <a href="1416.htm">1416</a>, <a href="1849.htm">1849</a>, and 'kingdom' meaning truth, but in the contrary sense falsity, <a href="1672.htm">1672</a>, <a href="2547.htm">2547</a>. And there will be famines, and plagues, and earthquakes in various places means that no cognitions 
of good and truth will exist any more, and thus that the state of the Church is altered, meant by 'an earthquake'. </p>

GENESEOS                     CAPUT VIGESIMUM SEXTUM </p>
<p>Maxima pars hominum credit quod interitura sint omnia quae in mundo aspectabili, cum ultimum judicium venit, quod nempe conflagrabit 
terra, sol et luna dissipabuntur, et sidera evanescent et quod novum caelum et nova terra postea exsurgent; eam opinionem ceperunt ex revelationibus propheticis in quibus talia memorantur sed 
quod aliter se res habeat, constare potest ab illis quae de Ultimum Judicio prius n. 900, 931, 1850, 2117-2133 ostensa sunt; inde patet quod Ultimum Judicium non aliud sit quam finis Ecclesiae apud unam 
gentem ac initium ejus apud aliam, qui finis et quod initium tunc existit quando nulla amplius agnitio Domini, seu quod idem quando nulla fides; nulla agnitio seu nulla fides est cum nulla charitas, 
nam fides nusquam dabilis est quam apud illos qui in charitate sunt; quod tunc Ecclesiae finis sit et ejus translatio ad alios, patet evidenter ab omnibus illis quae Ipse Dominus de ultimo illo die 
seu de consummatione saeculi docuit et praedixit apud Evangelistas, nempe apud Matthaeum xxiv, apud Marcum xiii et apud Lucam xxi. Sed quia illa absque clave, qui est sensus internus, a nemine comprehendi 
possunt, licet per vices illa quae ibi, evolvere; hic nunc primum haec quae apud Matthaeum,           [2] Accesserunt discipuli ad Jesum, dicentes, Dic nobis      quando ista fient, et quodnam 
signum Tui adventus et      consummationis saeculi: et respondens Jesus dixit illis; </p>
<p>     Videte ne quis vos seducat, multi enim venient in nomine Meo,      dicentes, Ego sum Christus; et multos seducent: 
audituri autem      estis bella, et rumores bellorum; videte ne turbemini; oportet      enim omnia fieri, sed nondum {1}est finis. Excitabitur namque      gens contra gentem, et regnum contra 
regnum; et erunt fames,      et pestes et terrae motus variis locis.  Omnia vero haec      initium dolorum, xxiv 3-8; </p>
<p>qui in sensu litterae manent, non scire possunt num haec et quae sequuntur 
in illo capite, dicta sint de destructione Hierosolymae et {2}dispersione gentis Judaicae, vel num de fine dierum qui Ultimum Judicium vocatur; at qui in sensu interno sunt, clare vident quod hic de fine 
Ecclesiae agatur, qui finis est qui hic et alibi vocatur adventus Domini et consummatio saeculi: et quia ille finis intelligitur, sciri potest quod omnia illa significent talia quae sunt Ecclesiae; 
quid autem significant, constare potest a singulis in sensu interno: ut, quod `multi venient in nomine Meo, dicentes, Ego sum Christus, et multos seducent'; ibi `nomen' non significat nomen, nec `Christus' 
Christum, sed `nomen' significat illud per quod colitur Dominus, n. 2724, 3006; et `Christus' ipsum verum, n. 3009, 3010; ita quod venturi qui dicent, hoc esse fidei, seu hoc esse verum, cum tamen 
nec fidei sit, nec verum, sed falsum: quod `audituri sint bella et rumores bellorum' est quod existent de veris disceptationes et lites, quae sunt bella in sensu spirituali: quod `excitabitur gens 
contra gentem, et regnum contra regnum' significat quod pugnaturum malum cum malo, et falsum cum falso; quod `gens' sit bonum, at in opposito sensu malum, videatur n. 1259, 1260, 1416, 1849, et quod 
`regnum' sit verum, {3}at in opposito sensu falsum, n. 1672, 2547: `et erunt fames et pestes, et terrae motus variis locis' est quod amplius nullae cognitiones boni et veri, ac ita quod Ecclesiae status 
sit mutatus, quod est `terrae motus.' @1 erit$  @2 dissipatione$  @3 sed$  </p>
