<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6125节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6125.</strong>“换了他们的马”表从理解力所提供的记忆知识。这从“马”的含义清楚可知，“马”是指形成理解力的观念（<a href="2760.htm">2760</a>-<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>，<a href="3217.htm">3217</a>，<a href="5321.htm">5321</a>节）；由于它们论及埃及，而埃及表示记忆知识，故“马”在此表示从理解力所提供的记忆知识。此处有必要阐述一下何为从理解力所提供的记忆知识。人的心智中有一个理解力部分和一个意愿部分，这些不仅在他的内在人中，还在他的外在人中。人的理解力从幼年到成年都在发展和成长，它就在于洞察从经验和记忆知识中所获得的事物，还在于从结果洞察原因，以及从一系列原因洞察后果。因此，理解力部分在于领悟并觉知诸如属于文明道德生活的那类事物。来自天堂的光之流注带来它的存在；因此，每个人的理解力都能变得更完善。理解力照着各人努力利用他所知道的，以及他的生活和个性而被赐予各人；只要头脑健全，没有人缺乏它。它被赐予人，是为了叫他能拥有选择的自由，也就是能自由选择良善或邪恶。人若没有像刚才所描述的这样一种理解力，就没有自己的能力去作出这种选择，因而没有任何东西能变成人自己的。<br />要进一步知道，接受属灵之物的，正是人心智的理解力部分；因此，它就是属灵真理与良善的接受者。因为若人没有这理解力部分，良善，即仁，和真理，即信，根本不可能被灌输给他；相反，它们照着他的理解力而被灌输。这也解释了为何一个人只有到了成年拥有理解力之后才被主重生。在此之前，爱之良善和信之真理就像种子落在了极贫瘠的地里。不过，一旦一个人已经重生，他的理解力就发挥看见并明白何为良善，由此看见并明白何为真理的功能。因为理解力会将属于天堂之光的那些事物转换为属于自然界之光的事物；前者由此显现在后者里面，犹如人的内心情感在没有伪装的情况显现在他的脸上一样。正因理解力发挥这种功能，所以在圣言中，许多经文在论述教会的属灵一面时，也论述教会的理解力；蒙主的神性怜悯，我们将在别处论述这个问题。<br />由此明显可知从理解力所提供的记忆知识是什么意思，即：它们是用来支持人以其理解力所领悟并觉知之物的记忆知识，无论这些事物是恶的还是善的。在圣言中，“埃及的马”就表示这些记忆知识；如以赛亚书：<br />祸哉！那些下埃及求帮助的，是因仗赖马匹，倚靠甚多的车辆，并倚靠强壮的马兵，却不仰望以色列的圣者，也不求问耶和华。埃及不过是人，并不是神；他的马不过是血肉，并不是灵。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛31.1.htm">31:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛31.3.htm">3</a>）<br />此处“埃及的马匹”表示从败坏的理解力所提供的记忆知识。<br />以西结书：<br />他却背叛巴比伦王，打发使者往埃及去，要他们给他马匹和多民。他岂能亨通呢？行这样事的人岂能逃脱呢？（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结17.15.htm">17:15</a>）<br />“埃及的马匹”也表示从败坏的理解力所提供的记忆知识，在信的事务上人们便求助于这些知识，若不凭这些知识，就不信圣言，也就是不信主。因此，信仰根本不存在，因为一种否定态度在败坏的理解力里面占据主导地位。<br />法老的马匹和战车被淹没在红海中就代表这类记忆知识被毁灭；由于“马匹”表示这些知识，“战车”表示虚假的教义事物，故“马匹和战车”经常在圣言中被提及（参看出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出14.17.htm">14:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出14.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出14.23.htm">23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出14.26.htm">26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出14.28.htm">28</a>）。此后摩西和米利暗所唱的歌中也包含这些话：<br />法老的马匹、战车和马兵下到海中，耶和华使海水回流到他们身上。你们要歌颂耶和华，因祂大大战胜，将马和骑马的投在海中。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出15.19.htm">15:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出15.21.htm">21</a>）<br />在摩西五经中，为管理以色列的王所规定的事也表示类似的记忆知识：<br />如果他们想要一个王，要从弟兄中立一个王来管理你；只是王不可为自己加添马匹，也不可使百姓回埃及去，为要使他加添马匹。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申17.15.htm">17:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申17.16.htm">16</a>）<br />“一个王”代表神性真理方面的主（<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="1728.htm">1728</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>，<a href="3009.htm">3009</a>，<a href="3670.htm">3670</a>，<a href="4575.htm">4575</a>，<a href="4581.htm">4581</a>，<a href="4789.htm">4789</a>，<a href="4966.htm">4966</a>，<a href="5044.htm">5044</a>，<a href="5068.htm">5068</a>节），因而代表聪明方面的主，因为这聪明若为纯正，就来自神性真理。要获得聪明必须通过圣言，也就是神性真理，而不能通过取自人自己的理解力的记忆知识，这一点由以下禁令来表示：王“不可为自己加添马匹，也不可使百姓回埃及去，为要使他加添马匹”。</p>

[In exchange] for the horses. That this signifies memory-knowledges from the intellectual, is evident from the signification of "horses," as being things intellectual (n. 2760-2762, 3217, 5321); and 
because they are predicated of Egypt, by which are signified memory-knowledges, "horses" here denote memory-knowledges from the intellectual. It is here necessary to state what these memory-knowledges 
from the intellectual are. Man has an intellectual, and he has a will, and this not only in his internal man, but also in his external. The intellectual in a man grows and increases from his infancy 
to his maturity, and consists in viewing things from what belongs to experience and to memory-knowledge; and also in viewing causes from effects; and in viewing consequences in connection with their causes. 
Thus the intellectual consists in the comprehension and perception of such things as are of civic and moral life. It comes into existence from the influx of light from heaven; and therefore every 
man can be perfected in respect to the intellectual. The intellectual is given to everyone according to his application, according to his life, and according to his nature; nor is it lacking in anyone, 
provided he is of sound mind. It is given to man to the end that he may be in freedom and in choice, that is, in the freedom of choosing good or evil. Unless man has such an intellectual as has been 
described, he cannot do this of himself, thus neither could anything be appropriated to him. [2] Be it known further, that it is man's intellectual which receives what is spiritual, so as to be a 
recipient of spiritual truth and good. For nothing of good, that is, of charity, and nothing of truth, that is, of faith, can be insinuated into anyone who has not an intellectual, but they are insinuated 
according to his intellectual; and therefore also man is not regenerated by the Lord until in adult age and possessed of an intellectual, before which period the good of love and truth of faith 
fall as seed into ground that is quite barren. But when a man has been regenerated, his intellectual performs the use of seeing and perceiving what is good, and thereby what is true; for the intellectual 
carries over those things which are of the light of heaven into those which are of the light of nature, whereby the former appear in the latter as do the interior affections of man in a face free 
from pretence; and as the intellectual performs this use, therefore in the Word, in many passages where the spiritual of the church is treated of, its intellectual also is treated of, as of the Lord's 
Divine mercy shall be shown elsewhere. [3] From all this it is now evident what is meant by memory-knowledges from the intellectual, namely, that they are memory-knowledges which confirm those things 
that a man intellectually apprehends and perceives, whether these are evil or good. These memory-knowledges are signified in the Word by "horses from Egypt;" as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Woe to them that go 
down into Egypt for help, and lean on horses; and trust on the chariot, because they are many, and upon the horsemen, because they are very strong; and they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, and seek 
not Jehovah. For Egypt is man, and not God; and his horses flesh, and not spirit (Isa. 31:1, 3); </p>
<p>where "horses from Egypt" denote memory-knowledges from a perverted intellectual. [4] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p> 
    He rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that it might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth this? (Ezek. 17:15); </p>
<p>where also "horses 
from Egypt" denote memory-knowledges from a perverted intellectual, which are consulted in matters of faith, while the Word, that is, the Lord, is not believed except from these; thus it is not believed 
at all, for denial reigns in a perverted intellectual. [5] That such memory-knowledges were destroyed is represented by the horses and chariots of Pharaoh being drowned in the sea Suph; and because 
these knowledges are signified by "horses," and false doctrinal things by "chariots," therefore "horses and chariots" are so often mentioned in the Word (see Exod. 14:17, 18, 23, 26, 28; and thereafter 
in the Song of Moses and Miriam): </p>
<p>     The horse of Pharaoh went in, and also his chariot, and also his horsemen, into the sea; but Jehovah caused the waters of the sea to return upon them. Sing 
ye to Jehovah, for exalting He hath exalted Himself; the horse and his rider hath He cast into the sea (Exod. 15:19, 21). [6] Similar memory-knowledges are also signified by what was prescribed in 
Moses for the king over Israel: </p>
<p>     If they desire a king, a king from the midst of the brethren shall be set over them; only he shall not multiply horses for himself, nor bring back the people into 
Egypt in order that he may multiply horses (Deut. 17:15, 16); </p>
<p>a king represented the Lord as to Divine truth (n. 1672, 1728, 2015, 2069, 3009, 3670, 4575, 4581, 4789, 4966, 5044, 5068), thus as to 
intelligence, for this when genuine is from Divine truth. That intelligence ought to be procured by means of the Word, which is Divine truth, and not by means of memory-knowledges from one's own intellectual, 
is signified by the injunction that the king "should not multiply horses, and should not bring back the people into Egypt in order that he may multiply horses." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6125</b></p><p><b>6125.</b>
'In exchange for horses' means factual knowledge supplied from the understanding. This is clear from the meaning of 'horses' as ideas forming the understanding, dealt with in <a href="2760.htm">2760</a>-<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>, <a href="3217.htm">3217</a>, <a href="5321.htm">5321</a>; and 
since they are spoken of in connection with Egypt, which means factual knowledge, 'horses' here are factual knowledge supplied from the understanding. But what factual knowledge supplied from the understanding 
is must be stated. There is an understanding part and there is a will part in the human mind, and these are situated not only in his internal man but also in his external. The human understanding 
is developing and growing from early childhood through to manhood, and it consists in a discernment of things gained from experience and formal knowledge, also a discernment of causes from effects 
as well as of consequences from a chain of causes. Thus the understanding part consists in a comprehension and perception of such things as are part of everyday life, public and private. An inflowing 
of light from heaven brings it into existence, and for that reason everyone's understanding is capable of being made more perfect. Understanding is given to everyone in accordance with his effort 
to make use of what he knows, in accordance with the life he leads, and in accordance with his individual character; no one lacks it provided he is of sound mind. A person is given it to the end that 
he may have freedom of choice, that is, have the freedom to choose good or evil. Unless he possesses an understanding like the one just described, he has no power of his own to make that choice; thus 
nothing could possibly be made his own. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In addition to this it should be recognized that the understanding part of a person's mind is that which receives what is spiritual, so that it is the 
recipient of spiritual truth and good. For no good at all, that is, no charity, nor any truth at all, that is, any faith, can be instilled into anyone if he does not have that understanding part; but 
they are instilled in the measure that he does have it. This also explains why a person is not regenerated by the Lord until adult life when he does possess an understanding. Till then the good of love 
and the truth of faith fall like seed into utterly infertile soil. But once a person has been regenerated his understanding serves the function of enabling him to see and perceive what good is and from 
this what truth is. For the understanding converts things belonging to the superior light of heaven into those belonging to the inferior light of the natural world, as a consequence of which the former 
are then seen within the latter in the same way as a person's inner affections are seen in his face when it lacks all pretence. And because the understanding serves that function, many places in 
the Word where the spiritual side of the Church is referred to refer also to its power of understanding, a matter which will in the Lord's Divine mercy be dealt with elsewhere. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From all this one 
may now see what is meant by factual knowledge supplied from the understanding, namely known facts which lend support to the things a person grasps and perceives with his understanding, whether those 
things are bad or good. Such facts are what are meant in the Word by 'horses from Egypt', as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Woe to those who go down into Egypt for help, and rely on horses and trust in chariots because 
they are many, and on horsemen because they are extremely strong, but do not look to the Holy One of Israel and do not seek Jehovah. For Egypt is man (homo), not God; and his horses are flesh, not 
spirit. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2031:1,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 31:1, 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Horses from Egypt' stands for factual knowledge supplied from a perverted understanding. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
He rebelled against him by sending his ambassadors to Egypt, 
that ha might give him horses and many people. Will he prosper? Will he who does this be rescued? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2017:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 17:15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Horses from Egypt' again stands for factual knowledge supplied from a perverted understanding, 
which knowledge is resorted to in matters of faith, though there is no belief in the Word, that is, in the Lord, apart from what that knowledge provides. Thus no belief ever comes to exist, 
for within a perverted understanding a negative attitude reigns. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 The destruction which such factual knowledge underwent is represented by the drowning of Pharaoh's horses and chariots in the Sea 
Suph; and since that knowledge is meant by 'horses' and false matters of doctrine by 'chariots', his horses and chariots are mentioned so many times in the description of that event, see Exod.14:17, <a href="18.htm">18</a>, <a href="27.htm">27</a>, <a href="26.htm">26</a>, <a href="28.htm">28</a>. And the Song of Moses and Miriam consequently contains these words, </p>
<blockquote>
Pharaoh's horse went, also his chariot, also his horsemen, into the sea; but Jehovah made the waters of the sea 
come back over them. Sing to Jehovah, for He has highly exalted Himself; He has thrown the horse and its rider into the sea. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2015:19,%2021&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 15:19, 21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 Similar factual knowledge is also meant by the things 
required before-hand for a king over Israel, in Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
If they desire a king, from among their brothers shall a king be set over them. Only let him not multiply horses for himself nor lead the 
people back into Egypt in order to multiply horses. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2017:15,%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 17:15, 16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'A king' represented the Lord as regards Divine Truth, <a href="1672.htm">1672</a>, <a href="1728.htm">1728</a>, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="2069.htm">2069</a>, <a href="3009.htm">3009</a>, <a href="3670.htm">3670</a>, <a href="4575.htm">4575</a>, <a href="4581.htm">4581</a>, <a href="4789.htm">4789</a>, <a href="4966.htm">4966</a>, <a href="5044.htm">5044</a>, <a href="5068.htm">5068</a>, thus 
as regards intelligence since this comes, when it is genuine, from Divine Truth. The need for intelligence to be acquired through the Word, which is Divine Truth, and not through factual knowledge 
taken from one's own understanding is meant by the injunction that the king should not multiply horses or lead the people back into Egypt in order to multiply horses. </p>

`Pro equis': quod significet scientifica ex intellectuali, constat ex significatione `equorum' quod sint intellectualia, de qua n. 2760-2762, 3217, 5321; et quia praedicantur de Aegypto per quam significantur 
scientifica, sunt hic `equi' scientifica ex intellectuali.  Quid scientifica ex intellectuali, dicendum: est homini intellectuale et est illi voluntarium, et haec non solum in interno ejus homine 
sed etiam in externo; intellectuale apud hominem augetur et crescit ab infantia ad virilem ejus aetatem, et consistit in intuitione rerum ex talibus quae sunt experientiae et scientiae, tum {1}in 
intuitione causarum ab effectibus, ut et consequentium ex nexu causarum; ita consistit intellectuale in comprehensione et perceptione talium quae sunt vitae civilis et moralis; existit ex influxu lucis 
e caelo, quapropter unusquisque homo quoad intellectuale potest perfici; intellectuale unicuique secundum applicationem, secundum vitam et secundum indolem datur, nec deficit ulli si modo sanae mentis 
sit; et datur homini ob finem, ut possit in libero et electione esse, hoc est, in libero {2}eligendi bonum aut malum; nisi intellectuale ei sit quale descriptum, ex semet non potest id facere, ita 
nec posset ei aliquid appropriari.  Ulterius sciendum quod intellectuale hominis sit quod recipit spirituale, ita ut sit recipiens veri et boni spiritualis; nihil enim boni, hoc est, charitatis, et 
nihil veri, hoc est, fidei, potest insinuari alicui qui non intellectuale habet, sed insinuantur secundum ejus intellectuale; quapropter etiam homo non regeneratur a Domino priusquam in adulta aetate 
cum ei intellectuale; prius cadit bonum amoris et verum fidei sicut semen in humum prorsus sterilem; cumque regeneratus est homo tunc intellectuale ejus praestat illum usum quod videat et percipiat quid 
bonum et inde quid verum, transfert enim intellectuale illa quae sunt lucis caeli in illa quae sunt luminis naturae, unde illa in his apparent sicut affectiones interiores hominis in facie non simulata; 
et quia intellectuale illum usum praestat, ideo in Verbo multis in locis ubi de spirituali Ecclesiae, etiam de intellectuali ejus agitur; de qua re, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, alibi.  Ex his 
nunc constare potest quid per scientifica ex intellectuali intelligitur, quod nempe scientifica quae confirmant (x)illa, quae homo intellectualiter capit et percipit, haec sive mala sint sive bona; haec 
scientifica sunt quae per `equos ex Aegypto' in Verbo significantur; ut apud Esaiam, Vae descendentibus in Aegyptum pro auxilio, et super equis innituntur; confiduntque super curru quod (x)multus, 
et super equitibus quod validi sint valde, et non respiciunt ad Sanctum Israelis, et Jehovam non quaerunt; nam Aegyptus homo non Deus, et equi ejus caro non spiritus, xxxi 1,3: </p>
<p>[4] `equi ex Aegypto' 
pro scientificis ex intellectuali perverso: apud Ezechielem, Rebellavit contra eum, mittendo legatos suos in Aegyptum,  ut daret illi equos, et populum multum: num prosperabitur?  num eripietur faciens 
hoc xvii 15; </p>
<p>`equi ex Aegypto' etiam pro scientificis ex intellectuali perverso, quae consuluntur in rebus fidei, et non creditur Verbo, hoc est, Domino, nisi ex illis; ita nunquam creditur, nam 
in intellectuali perverso regnat negativum.  [5] Quod talia scientifica destructa sint, repraesentatur per `quod equi et currus Pharaonis submersi sint in mari Suph'; et quia illa, per `equos', et falsa 
doctrinalia per `currus' significantur, ideo toties ibi equi et currus nominantur, videatur Exod. xiv 17, 18, 23, 26, 28; et inde in Cantico Mosis et Miriamis, Ingressus est equus Pharaonis, tum 
currus ejus, tum equites ejus in mare; sed redire fecit Jehovah super eos aquas maris....  Cantate Jehovae, quia exaltando exaltavit Se, equum et equitem ejus projecit in mare, Exod. xv 19, 21. [6] Similia 
scientifica etiam significantur per illa quae praescripta sunt regi super Israelem, apud Mosen, Si regem cupiant, e medio fratrum ponetur super eos rex; modo non multiplicet sibi equos, nec reducat 
populum in  Aegyptum ut multiplicet equos, Deut. xvii 15, 16; </p>
<p>`rex' repraesentabat Dominum quoad Divinum Verum, n. 1672, 1728, 2015, 2069, 3009, 3670, 4575, 4581, 4789, 4966, 5044, 5068, ita quoad 
intelligentiam, haec enim cum genuina, est ex Divino Vero; quod intelligentia per Verbum quod est Divinum Verum, comparanda sit, non autem per scientifica ex proprio intellectuali, significatur per 
quod `rex non multiplicaret equos, et non reduceret populum in Aegyptum ut multiplicet equos'. @1 ex I$ @2 et elegendi I$ </p>
