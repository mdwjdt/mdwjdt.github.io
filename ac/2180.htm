<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2180节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2180.</strong>“牵了一只又嫩又好的牛犊来”表理性给自己所取的适合的属天-属世之物，为的是它可以将自己与来自神性的直觉结合起来。这从圣言中“小公牛”或“牛犊”的含义清楚可知，“小公牛”或“牛犊”是指属世良善。由于此处论述的是主的理性，故它因属天-属灵之物或善之真而被称为“嫩”，因属天之物本身或良善本身而被称为“好”。真正的理性中既有对真理的情感，也有对良善的情感；但它的首要事物是对真理的情感，如前所示（<a href="2072.htm">2072</a>节）。这解释了为何此处先提及“嫩”，后提及“好”。然而，按照圣言中的惯例，它被称为“又嫩又好”，以表明善与真的婚姻（如前所述，<a href="2173.htm">2173</a>节）。<br />“小公牛”或“牛犊” 表属天-属世之物，或也可说，表属世良善。这一点尤其从祭物明显看出来，祭物是希伯来教会，以及后来犹太教会敬拜的主要代表。“小公牛”或“牛犊”表属天-属世之物，或也可说，表属世良善。这一点尤其从祭物明显看出来，他们的祭物要么取自牛群，要么取自羊群，因而取自各种洁净的动物，如公牛、小公牛、公山羊、绵羊、公绵羊、母山羊、小山羊和羔羊，此外还有斑鸠和雏鸽。所有这些动物都表示敬拜的内在事物，即属天和属灵之物（<a href="2165.htm">2165</a>，<a href="2177.htm">2177</a>节）。取自牛群的动物表属天-属世之物，而取自羊群的动物则表属天-理性之物。由于属世之物和理性之物越来越内在，并且各种各样，故献祭时才会用到这么多种类的动物。这一事实也可从经上规定在献燔祭和各种祭物时当用哪种动物明显看出来，如日常的祭物，安息日和节日所献的祭物，甘心祭、感恩祭、还愿祭、赎愆祭、赎罪祭，以及净化、清洁和就职典礼中所用的祭物。经上明确提到在每种祭祀中要用哪种动物，以及用多少。若非每一种都具有某种特定意义，这是不可能的。这一点从论述这些祭物的经文很清楚地看出来（如出埃及记29；利未记1，3-4，9，16，23；民数记7-8，15，29）。不过，此处不宜解释每一种表示什么。先知书的情形也一样，那里提到了这些动物，通过它们明显可知“小公牛”表属天-属世之物。<br />所表示的不是别的，正是天堂事物。这也可从以西结所看到的基路伯，以及约翰所看到宝座前的活物明显看出来。关于基路伯，该先知说：<br />至于脸的形像：前面各有人的脸，四个右面各有狮子的脸，四个左面各有牛的脸，四个后面各有鹰的脸。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结1.10.htm">1:10</a>）<br />关于宝座前的四活物，约翰说：<br />宝座周围有四个活物：第一个活物像狮子，第二个像牛犊，第三个脸面像人，第四个像飞鹰。他们说，圣哉，圣哉，圣哉，主神全能者，昔在、今在、以后永在。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启4.7.htm">4:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启4.8.htm">8</a>）<br />谁都能看出，基路伯和这些动物，以及祭祀用的公牛和小公牛代表圣物。这同样适用于摩西关于约瑟的预言：<br />愿这些福都归于约瑟的头上，那与弟兄迥别的拿撒勒人的头顶上。他为牛群中头生的，有威严；他的角是野牛的角，用来抵触万民，直到地极。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.16.htm">33:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.17.htm">17</a>）<br />没有人理解这些话，除非他知道就内义而言，牛、野牛、牛角和其它事物表示什么。<br />至于一般的祭祀，它们的确通过摩西被规定给以色列人。但是，洪水前的上古教会根本不知道什么祭祀，他们从没想到以宰杀动物来敬拜主。洪水后的古教会同样不知道祭祀，诚然，古教会存在代表物，但那不是祭物。事实上，首次引入祭祀的是随后的教会，也就是所谓的希伯来教会，并由此传到外邦民族，甚至传到亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各，以及雅各的后代那里。外邦民族有祭祀敬拜，这一事实早已说明（<a href="1343.htm">1343</a>节）；雅各的后代在出埃及前也有这种敬拜，因而在祭祀前由摩西率领来到西乃山上，这一事实从出埃及记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/出5.3.htm">5:3</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出10.25.htm">10:25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出10.27.htm">27</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出18.12.htm">18:12</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出24.4.htm">24:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出24.5.htm">5</a>），尤其从他们在金牛犊面前进行偶像崇拜明显看出来。<br />对此，摩西五经是这样描述的：<br />亚伦就在牛犊面前筑坛，且宣告说，明日要向耶和华守节。次日清早，百姓起来献燔祭和平安祭，就坐下吃喝，起来玩耍。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出32.5.htm">32:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出32.6.htm">6</a>）<br />这事发生时，摩西还在西乃山上，因而发生在关于祭坛和献祭的条例降临到他们那里之前。条例降临到他们那里，是因为他们的祭祀敬拜已变成偶像崇拜，与外邦人无异，并且他们无法从这种敬拜中退出，因为他们视其为主要圣物。一旦小时候植入在人里面的某种事物被视为神圣，尤其是从父亲那里接受的，从而扎根下来，只要它不违反秩序本身，主从不破碎它，而是将它折过来。这就是为何经上规定祭祀体系要按照摩西五经上所描述的方式确立的原因。<br />祭祀绝不蒙耶和华悦纳，因而仅仅是为了上述原因而被允许和容忍，这从先知书非常明显地看出来，如我们在耶利米书中所读到的：<br />万军之耶和华以色列的神如此说：你们将燔祭加在你们的祭物上，吃肉吧！因为我将你们列祖从埃及地领出来的那日，燔祭和祭物的事我并没有提说，也没有吩咐他们。我只吩咐他们这一件说：你们当听从我的声音，我就作你们的神。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶7.21.htm">7:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶7.23.htm">23</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />耶和华啊，祭物和供物，你不喜悦，燔祭和赎罪祭非你所要。我的神啊，我乐意照你的旨意行。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗40.6.htm">40:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗40.8.htm">8</a>）<br /><br />你本不喜爱祭物，若喜爱，我就献上；燔祭你也不喜悦。神所要的祭，就是痛悔的灵。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗51.16.htm">51:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗51.17.htm">17</a>）<br /><br />我不从你家中取公牛，也不从你圈内取公山羊。你们要以忏悔为祭献与神。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗50.9.htm">50:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗50.13.htm">13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗50.14.htm">14</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗107.21.htm">107:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗107.22.htm">22</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗116.17.htm">116:17</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申23.19.htm">23:19</a>）<br />何西阿书：<br />我喜爱怜恤，不喜爱祭祀；喜爱认识神，胜于燔祭！（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何6.6.htm">6:6</a>）<br />撒母耳对扫罗说：<br />耶和华岂会喜悦燔祭和平安祭？看哪，听命胜于献祭；顺从胜于公羊的脂油。（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上15.22.htm">15:22</a>）<br />弥迦书：<br />我朝见耶和华，在至高神面前跪拜，难道我朝见他，要带着燔祭，带着一岁的牛犊么？耶和华岂喜悦千千的公羊，或是万万的油河吗？世人哪，耶和华已指示你何为善，耶和华向你所要的是什么呢？只要你行公义，好怜悯，存谦卑的心，与你的神同行。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥6.6.htm">6:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥6.8.htm">8</a>）<br />由上述经文明显可知，祭祀不是被要求的，而是被允许的；还可知在祭祀中所要关注的是内在之物，而不是别的；蒙悦纳的是内在之物，而非外在之物。也因此缘故，主废除了它们，这也是但以理在提及主到来时以下面这些话所预言的：<br />一七之半，祂必使祭祀与供献止息。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但9.27.htm">9:27</a>）<br />此处论述的是主的到来（关于祭祀的说明，可参看第一卷，<a href="922.htm">922</a>-<a href="923.htm">923</a>，<a href="1128.htm">1128</a>，<a href="1823.htm">1823</a>节）。至于亚伯拉罕为这三人所预备的“牛犊”，其含义和用于祭祀的牛犊一样。它具有类似含义，这也可从他吩咐撒拉取三斗细面饭明显看出来。关于和公牛一同献上的细面，我们在摩西五经中读到（当他们将要进入那地时提到）：<br />你预备公牛作燔祭或祭物，为要还特许的愿或是作平安祭献给耶和华，就要把细面伊法十分之三并油半欣，调和作素祭，和公牛一同献上。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.8.htm">15:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.9.htm">9</a>）<br />此处同样出现数字“三”，只是此处献上“十分之三”，而亚伯拉罕吩咐撒拉的是“三斗”。不过，与公绵羊一起只能献上十分之二，与羔羊一起只能献上十分之一（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.4.htm">15:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.6.htm">6</a>）。</p>

And took a son of an ox tender and good. That this signifies the celestial natural which the rational associated to itself, in order that it might conjoin itself with the perception from the Divine, 
is evident from the signification in the Word of a "bullock" or "son of an ox," as being natural good. And as the Lord's rational is treated of, it is called "tender" from the celestial-spiritual, or 
the truth of good; and "good" from the celestial itself, or good itself. In the genuine rational there is the affection of truth and the affection of good; but its chief thing [primarium] is the affection 
of truth (as before shown, n. 2072). Hence it is first called "tender," and yet is called both "tender and good," according to the usual practice in the Word, to indicate the marriage of good and 
truth (spoken of above, n. 2173). [2] That a "bullock," or "son of an ox," signifies the celestial natural, or what is the same, natural good, is especially evident from the sacrifices, which were the 
principal representatives of worship in the Hebrew Church, and afterwards in the Jewish. Their sacrifices were made either from the herd or from the flock, thus from animals of various kinds that were 
clean, such as oxen, bullocks, he-goats, sheep, rams, she-goats, kids, and lambs; besides turtledoves and young pigeons, all of which animals signified internal things of worship, that is, things 
celestial and spiritual (n. 2165, 2177); the animals taken from the herd signifying celestial natural things, and those from the flock celestial rational things; and as both the natural and the rational 
things are more and more interior, and are various, therefore so many kinds and species of those animals were made use of in the sacrifices; as is also evident from its being prescribed what animals 
should be offered-in the burnt-offerings; in the sacrifices of various kinds, as in those that were daily, those of the Sabbaths and festivals, those that were voluntary, those for thanksgiving and 
vows, those expiatory of guilt and sin, those of purifying and cleansing, and those of inauguration-and also from their being expressly named, and how many of them should be used in each kind of sacrifice; 
which would never have been done unless each had signified some special thing. This is very evident from those passages where the sacrifices are treated of (as Exod. 29; Lev. 1, 3-4, 9, 16, 23; 
Num. 7-8, 15, 29). But this is not the place to set forth what each one signified. The case is similar in the Prophets where these animals are named, and from them it is evident that "bullocks" signified 
celestial natural things. [3] That no other than heavenly things were signified, is also evident from the cherubs seen by Ezekiel, and from the animals before the throne seen by John. Concerning 
the cherubs the Prophet says: </p>
<p>     The likeness of their faces was the face of a man, and they four had the face of a lion on the right side, and they four had the face of an ox on the left side, and 
they four had the face of an eagle (Ezek. 1:10). Concerning the four animals before the throne John says: </p>
<p>     Around the throne were four animals; the first animal was like a lion, the second animal 
like a young bullock, the third animal had a face like a man, the fourth animal was like a flying eagle; saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come (Rev. 4:6-8). Everyone 
can see that holy things were represented by the cherubs and by these animals, and also by the oxen and young bullocks in the sacrifices. In like manner in the prophecy of Moses concerning 
Joseph: </p>
<p>     Let it come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the head of him that was a Nazirite from his brethren. The firstling of his ox, honor is his; and his horns are the horns 
of the unicorn, with them he shall push the peoples together, to the ends of the earth (Deut. 33:16-17). None can understand these things unless it is known what an ox, a unicorn, horns, and other things 
signify in the internal sense. [4] As regards sacrifices in general, they were indeed enjoined through Moses on the people of Israel, but the Most Ancient Church, that existed before the flood, 
knew nothing whatever about sacrifices; nor did it even come into their minds to worship the Lord by slaughtering animals. The Ancient Church, that existed after the flood, was likewise unacquainted 
with sacrifices. This church was indeed in representatives, but not in sacrifices. In fact sacrifices were first instituted in the following church, which was called the Hebrew Church, and from this spread 
to the nations, and from the same source they came to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and thus to the descendants of Jacob. That the nations were in a worship of sacrifices, was shown above (n. 1343); 
and that so were Jacob's posterity before they went out of Egypt, thus before sacrifices were commanded by Moses upon Mount Sinai, is evident from what is said in Exodus 5:3; 10:25, 27; 18:12; 24:4-5; 
and especially from their idolatrous worship before the golden calf.  [5] Thus described in Moses: </p>
<p>     Aaron built an altar before the calf, and Aaron made proclamation and said, Tomorrow is the 
feast of Jehovah. And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt-offerings and brought peace-offerings; and the people sat down to eat, and to drink, and rose up to play (Exod. 32:5-6). This 
was done while Moses was upon Mount Sinai, and thus before the command concerning the altar and the sacrifices came to them. The command came on this account-that the worship of sacrifices had become 
idolatrous with them, as it had with the gentiles, and from this worship they could not be withdrawn, because they regarded it as the chief holy thing. For what has once been implanted from infancy 
as holy, especially if by fathers, and thus inrooted, the Lord never breaks, but bends, unless it is contrary to order itself. This is the reason why it was directed that sacrifices should be instituted 
in the way described in the books of Moses. [6] That sacrifices were by no means acceptable to Jehovah, thus were merely permitted and tolerated for the reason just stated, is very evident in the 
Prophets, as we read in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Thus saith Jehovah Zebaoth the God of Israel, Add your burnt-offerings to your sacrifices, and eat flesh. I spoke not unto your fathers, and I commanded them not 
in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt-offering and sacrifice; but this word I commanded them, saying, Obey My voice, and I will be your God (Jer. 7:21-23). In David: </p>
<p> 
    O Jehovah, sacrifice and offering Thou hast not willed, burnt-offering and sin-offering Thou hast not required. I have desired to do Thy will, O my God (Ps. 40:6, 8). In the same: </p>
<p>     Thou 
delightest not in sacrifice, that I should give it; burnt-offering Thou dost not accept. The sacrifices of God are a broken* spirit (Ps. 51:16-17). In the same: </p>
<p>     I will take no bullock out of 
thy house, nor he-goats out of thy folds; sacrifice to God confession (Ps. 50:9, 13-14; 107:21-22; 116:17; Deut. 23:19). In Hosea: </p>
<p>     I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God 
more than burnt-offerings (Hos. 6:6). Samuel said to Saul: </p>
<p>     Hath Jehovah pleasure in burnt-offerings and sacrifices? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, to hearken than the fat of rams (1 
Sam. 15:22). In Micah: </p>
<p>     Wherewith shall I come before Jehovah, and bow myself to the high God? Shall I come before Him with burnt-offerings, with calves of a year old? Will Jehovah be pleased 
with thousands of rams, with ten thousands of rivers of oil? He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth Jehovah require of thee, but to do judgment, and to love mercy, and to humble thyself 
in walking with thy God (Micah 6:6-8). [7] From all this it is now evident that sacrifices were not commanded, but permitted; also that nothing else was regarded in the sacrifices than what is internal; 
and that it was the internal, not the external, that was acceptable. On this account also, the Lord abrogated them, as was likewise foretold by Daniel in these words: </p>
<p>     In the midst of the 
week shall He cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease (Dan. 9:27), where the Lord's advent is treated of. (See what is said concerning sacrifices in volume 1, n. 922-923, 1128, 1823.) As regards 
the "son of an ox" which Abraham "made" or prepared for the three men, the case is the same as with that animal in the sacrifices. That it had a like signification is evident also from his telling Sarah 
to take three measures of fine flour. Concerning the fine flour to a bullock, we read in Moses: </p>
<p>     When ye be come into the land; when thou shalt make a son of an ox a burnt-offering or a sacrifice, 
in pronouncing publicly a vow, or peace-offerings unto Jehovah, thou shalt offer upon the son of an ox a meat offering of three tenths of fine flour, mingled with oil (Num. 15:8-9), where it is 
in like manner "three," here "three tenths," and above, "three measures;" but to a ram there were to be only two tenths, and to a lamb one tenth (Num. 15:4-6). * Contritus; but infractus n. 9818. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2180</b></p><p><b>2180.</b>
'And took a young bull, tender and good' means a celestial-natural which the rational took to itself in order that it might join itself to perception from the Divine. This is clear from the meaning of 
'a young burl' or 'a son of an ox' in the Word as natural good. And because the subject is the Lord's Rational, it is called 'tender' from the celestial-spiritual, which is truth grounded in good, and 
'good' from the celestial itself, which is good itself. Within the genuine rational there is both the affection for truth and the affection for good, but that which is first and foremost there is the 
affection for truth, as shown already in <a href="2072.htm">2072</a>. This explains why 'tender' is mentioned before 'good'; but even so, as is quite usual in the Word, both are mentioned on account of the marriage of truth 
and good which is referred to above in <a href="2173.htm">2173</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That 'a young bull' or 'a son of an ox' means the celestial-natural, or what amounts to the same, natural good, becomes especially clear from the 
sacrifices, which were the principal representatives in the worship of the Hebrew Church and after this of the Jewish Church. Their sacrifices were made either from the herd or from the flock, thus 
from animals of various kinds that were clean, such as oxen, young bulls, he-goats, sheep, rams, she-goats, kids, and lambs, besides doves and fledgling pigeons. All of these creatures meant the internal 
features of worship, that is, celestial and spiritual things, <a href="2165.htm">2165</a>, <a href="2177.htm">2177</a>, those from the herd meaning celestial-natural, those from the flock celestial-rational. Because both of these - natural things 
and rational things - are more and more interior and are various, so many genera and so many species of these creatures were therefore employed in sacrifices. This fact becomes clear also from its 
being laid down as to which creatures were to be offered in burnt offerings and also which in every kind of sacrifice - the daily sacrifices; those offered on sabbaths and at festivals; those made as 
free-will, eucharistic, or votive offerings; and those offered in purifications, cleansings, and also in inaugurations. Which creatures were to be used, and how many, in each kind of sacrifice is mentioned 
explicitly. This would never have been done unless each one had had some specific meaning, as is quite evident from those places where the sacrifices are the subject, as in Chapter <a href="29.htm">29</a> of Exodus; 
Chapters <a href="1.htm">1</a>, <a href="3.htm">3</a>, <a href="4.htm">4</a>, <a href="9.htm">9</a>, <a href="16.htm">16</a>, and <a href="23.htm">23</a> of Leviticus; and Chapters <a href="7.htm">7</a>, <a href="8.htm">8</a>, <a href="15.htm">15</a>, and <a href="29.htm">29</a> of Numbers. But this is not the place to explain what each one meant. The situation is similar in the Prophets where those 
animals are mentioned, from which it may become clear that young bulls meant celestial-natural things. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That none but heavenly things were meant becomes clear also from the cherubim seen by Ezekiel 
and from the living creatures before the throne which were seen by John. Regarding the cherubim the prophet says, </p>
<blockquote>
The likeness of their faces was the face of a man (homo); and they four had the 
face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; and they four had the face of an eagle. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%201:%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 1: 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Regarding the four living creatures before the throne 
John says, </p>
<blockquote>
Around the throne were four living creatures - the first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature like a young bull, the third living creature had a face like a man (homo), 
the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle - saying, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%204:%207,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 4: 7, 8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone may see that holy things 
were represented by the cherubim and these living creatures, thus also by the oxen and young bulls in the sacrifices. The same applies in the prophecy of Moses concerning Joseph, </p>
<blockquote>
Let it come upon 
the head of Joseph and upon the crown of the head of the Nazirite among his brothers. The firstborn of his ox has honour, and his horns are the horns of a unicorn; with these he will thrust the peoples 
together, to the ends of the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2033:%2016,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 33: 16, 17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>These words are not intelligible to anyone unless he knows what ox, unicorn, horns, and many other things mean in the internal sense. </p>
<p></p>

As for sacrifices in general they were indeed commanded to the Israelites through Moses. But the Most Ancient Church which existed before the Flood never knew anything at all about sacrifices, nor did 
it ever enter their minds to worship the Lord by the slaughtering of animals. The Ancient Church which existed after the Flood knew nothing about it either. Representatives did indeed exist there, but 
not sacrifices. These were first introduced in the subsequent Church called the Hebrew Church, and from there they spread to the gentile nations, and even to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and so to Jacob's 
descendants. The fact that the gentile nations had sacrificial worship has been shown in <a href="1343.htm">1343</a>, and the fact that Jacob's descendants also had such worship before they left Egypt, thus before sacrifices 
were commanded through Moses on Mount Sinai, becomes clear from <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%205:%203;%2010:%2025,%2027;%2018:%2012;%2024:%204,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 5: 3; 10: 25, 27; 18: 12; 24: 4, 5</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 This is especially clear from their idolatrous worship in front of the golden calf, 
regarding which the following is said in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Aaron built an altar in front of the calf, and Aaron made a proclamation and said, Tomorrow there will be a feast to Jehovah. And they rose up early 
the next morning and presented burnt offerings and brought peace offerings. And the people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2032:%205,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 32: 5, 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This happened while Moses was on Mount 
Sinai, and so before the command came to them regarding the altar and the sacrifices. That command came to them for the reason that sacrificial worship among them had been turned, as it had among the 
gentiles, into idolatrous worship, from which they could not be drawn away because they looked upon it as-the chief holy thing. Once something has been implanted in people from their earliest years as 
being holy, the more so if received from their fathers, and thus is inrooted, the Lord in no way breaks it - provided it is not contrary to order itself - but bends it. This was the reason for its being 
laid down that the sacrificial system should be established, such as one reads in the books of Moses. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 The fact that sacrifices were by no means acceptable to Jehovah, and so were merely permitted 
and tolerated for the reason just stated, is quite evident in the Prophets. Concerning them the following is said in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said Jehovah Zebaoth, the God of Israel, Add your burnt offerings 
on to your sacrifices, and eat the flesh. I did not speak with your fathers and I did not command them on the day I brought them out of the land of Egypt on the matters of burnt offering and 
sacrifice. But this matter I commanded them, saying, Obey My voice, and I will be your God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%207:%2021-23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 7: 21-23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In David, </p>
<blockquote>
O Jehovah, sacrifice and offering You have not desired; burnt offering and sin-sacrifices 
You have not sought. I have delighted to do Your will, O my God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2040:%206,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 40: 6, 8</a>.

<p>In the same author, </p>

You do not delight in sacrifice that I should give it; burnt offering You do not accept.

<p>In Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>

<p>Samuel said to Saul, </p>
<blockquote>
Has Jehovah 
great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices? Behold, to be submissive is better than sacrifice, to be obedient than the fat of rams. - <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1%20Sam%2015:%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">1 Sam 15: 22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Micah, </p>
<blockquote>
With what shall I come 
before Jehovah and bow myself to God on high? Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old? Will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams, with tens of thousands of rivers of 
oil? He has shown you, O man, what is good; and what does Jehovah require of you but to carry out judgement, and to love mercy, and to humble yourself by walking with your God? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Micah%206:-6-8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Micah 6:-6-8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 From 
these quotations it is now evident that sacrifices were not commanded but permitted, and also that in sacrifices nothing else was regarded except that which was internal, and that it was that which 
was internal that was pleasing, not that which was external. For this reason also the Lord abolished them, as was also foretold through Daniel in the following words when he was speaking about the Lord's 
Coming, </p>
<blockquote>
In the middle of the week He will cause the sacrifice and the offering to cease. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%209:%2027&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 9: 27</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>See what has been stated about sacrifices in Volume One, in <a href="922.htm">922</a>, <a href="923.htm">923</a>, <a href="1128.htm">1128</a>, <a href="1823.htm">1823</a>. As for 
'the young bull' which Abraham made ready or prepared for the three men, the meaning is similar to that of the same animals when used in sacrifices. That it had a similar meaning becomes clear also from 
the fact that he told Sarah to take three measures of fine flour. Regarding the fine flour that went with the offering of a young bull the following is said in Moses - referring to when they were 
to come into the land, </p>
<blockquote>
When you make ready a young bull for a burnt offering or a sacrifice in the declaring of a vow, or for peace offerings to Jehovah, you shall bring with the young bull a minchah 
of three tenths of fine flour mixed with oil. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2015:%208,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 15: 8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here similarly the number 'three' appears, though three 'tenths' here but three 'measures' in Abraham's instruction to Sarah. But only 
two tenths went with the offering of a ram, one tenth with that of a lamb, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2015:%204-6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 15: 4-6</a>. </p>

Quod `accepit filium bovis tenerum et bonum' significet caeleste naturale quod rationale sibi adscivit ut perceptioni ex Divina se conjungeret, constat ex significatione `juvenci' seu `filii bovis' 
in Verbo quod sit bonum naturale, et quia agitur de Rationali Domini, dicitur `tener' ex caelesti spirituali seu boni vero, ac `bonus' ex ipsa caelesti seu ipso bono; in rationali genuino est affectio 
veri et est affectio boni, sed primarium ejus est affectio veri, ut prius n. 2072 ostensum, inde `tenerum' praemittitur; at usque utrumque dicitur: ut solitum est in Verbo, propter conjugium veri et 
boni, de quo supra n. 2173.  [2] Quod `juvencus seu filius bovis' significet caeleste naturale; seu quod idem est, bonum naturale, imprimis constare potest a sacrificiis, quae praecipua repraesentativa 
cultus Ecclesiae Hebraeae et postea Judaicae fuerunt; sacrificia illorum fiebant vel ex armento vel ex grege, ita ex varii generis animalibus quae munda fuerunt, ut es bovibus, juvencis, hircis, ovibus, 
arietibus, capris, haedis, et agnis, praeter a turturibus et pullis columbarum: omnia illa significabant interna cultus, hoc est, caelestia et spiritualia, n. 2165, 2177, et quidem illa quae de armento, 
caelestia naturalia, et quae de grege, caelestia rationalia; illa et haec, nempe naturalia et rationalia quia interiora magis et magis sunt ac varia, ideo tot genera ac tot species illorum animalium 
in sacrificiis adhibebantur; quod etiam inde constare potest quod praescriptum, ut in holocaustis, tum in sacrificiis diversi generis, ut in quotidianis, sabbatorum et festorum, in voluntariis, 
eucharisticis et votivis, expiatoriis reatus et peccati, tum in purificatoriis et mundatoriis ut et in inauguratoriis, quaenam animalia offerrentur et quod expresse nominata sint, tum quot illorum, in 
unoquovis genere sacrificii; quod nusquam factum nisi unumquodvis aliquid peculiare significavisset, ut manifeste patet (o)ab illis locis ubi de sacrificiis agitur, ut Exod. xxix; Lev. i; iii; iv; ix; 
xvi; xxiii; Num. vii; viii; xv; xxix; quid autem (t)unumquodvis significavit, non hujus loci est exponere; similiter se habet apud Prophetas, ubi nominantur; ex illis constare potest quod juvenci {1} 
significaverint caelestia naturalia; [3] quod non alia quam caelestia significata sint, constare potest etiam ex cherubis visis Ezechieli, et ex animalibus coram throno visis Johanni: de cherubis ita 
propheta, 	Similitudo facierum illorum, facies hominis, et facies leonis, ad dextram quatuor illis, et facies bovis ad sinistram quatuor illis, ac facies aquilae quatuor illis, Ezech. i 10; </p>
<p>de quatuor 
animalibus coram throno, ita Johannes, 	Circa thronum quatuor animalia, primum animal simile leoni, alterum animal simile juvenco, tertium animal habens faciem sicut homo, quartum animal simile 
aquilae volanti;... dicentia, Sanctus, sanctus, sanctus Dominus Deus, Omnipotens, Qui erat, et Qui est, et Qui venturus, Apoc. iv 7, 8; </p>
<p>quod per `cherubos' et per `animalia illa' repraesentata sint 
sancta unusquisque videre potest, ita quoque per boves et juvencos {2} (o)ibi similiter quae in prophetia Mosis de Josepho, de quo ita, 	Veniat capiti Josephi et vertici naziraei fratrum illius: primogenito 
bovis ejus, honos illi, et cornua monocerotis cornua ejus, his populos feriet una, ad fines terrae, Deut. xxxiii 16, 17; </p>
<p>haec nulli intelligibilia forent nisi sciatur quid in sensu interno significat 
bos, monoceros, cornua, et plura.  [4] Quod in genere sacrificia attinet, fuerunt quidem mandata per Mosen populo Israelitico; sed Antiquissima Ecclesia quae ante diluvium, nusquam aliquid novit 
de sacrificiis, nec in mentem eorum usquam venit ut per mactationes animalium colerent Dominum; Antiqua Ecclesia quae post diluvium, etiam ignoravit; haec quidem in repraesentativis fuit sed non in 
sacrificiis; verum primum instituta (o)sunt in Ecclesia sequente qua Hebraea dicta, ac inde emanavit ad gentes, (m)inde (o)etiam a Abrahamum, Isacum, et Jacobum, et sic ad hujus posteros; quo gentes 
in cultu sacrificiorum fuerint, ostensum est n. 1343, et quo Jacobi posteri antequam egressi Aegypto, ita antequam (o)sacrificia per Mosen super monte Sinai mandata,(n) constare potest ex Exod. v 3; 
x 25, 27; xviii 12; xxiv 4, 5; [5] imprimis ex idololatrico illorum coram vitulo aureo, de quo ita apud Mosen, 	Aharon aedificavit altare coram vitulo, et proclamavit Aharon, et dixit, Festum Jehovae 
cras; et surrexerunt mane a crastino, e obtulerunt holocausta, et adduxerunt pacifica; et sedit populus ad edendum et bibendum, et surrexerunt ad ludendum, Exod. xxxii 5, 6; </p>
<p>et hoc factum cum Moses 
fuit super monte Sinai, (c)ac ita antequam mandatum ad (c)eos pervenit de altari et sacrificiis; quod mandatum idcirco venit, quia cultus sacrificiorum apud eos, sicut apud gentiles, in idololatricum 
versus erat, a quo cultu non {3} removeri potuerunt quia principale sanctum in illo posuerunt, et quod ut sanctum semel implantatum est, ab infantia, magis a patribus, et sic irradicatum, hoc nisi sit 
contra ipsum ordinem, Dominus nusquam frangit, sed flectit illa causa fuit quod praescriptum fuerit ut ita instituerentur, sicut in libris Mosis legitur; [6] (m)quod sacrificia nusquam accepta fuerint 
Jehovae ita quod (o)modo permissa et tolerata ob causam de qua dictum, patet manifeste apud Prophetas; de illis ita apud Jeremiam,(n) 	Dixit Jehovah Zebaoth, Deus Israelis, Holocausta vestra addite 
supra sacrificia vestra, et comedite carnem; non locutus sum cum patribus vestris, et non praecepi eis in die quo eduxi eos e terra Aegypti, super verbis holocausti et sacrificii; sed verbum hoc praecepi 
iis, dicendo, Oboedite voci Meae, et ero vobis in Deum, (x)vii 21-23: </p>
<p>apud Davidem, 	Jehovah, sacrificium et munus non voluisti,... holocaustum et sacrificia peccati non petiisti, facere voluntatem 
Tuam, Deus mi desideravi, Ps. xi 7, 9 [A.V. 6, 8]: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Non delectaris sacrificio ut dem, holocaustum non acceptas; sacrificia Dei, spiritus contritus, Ps. li 18, 19 [A.V. 16, 17]: </p>
<p>apud 
eundem, 	Non accipiam e domo tua juvencum, e caulis tuis hircos, sacrifica Deo confessionem, Ps. l 9, (x)14; (m) 21, 22; cxvi 17; Deut. xxiii 19:(n) apud Hosheam, 	Misericordiam volo, et non sacrificium, 
et cognitionem {4} Dei prae holocaustis, vi 6: </p>
<p>Samuel ad Schaulem, 	Num complacentia Jehovae in holocaustis et sacrificiis? ecce obtemperare prae sacrificio bonum, oboedientia {5} prae adipe 
arietum, 1 Sam. xv 22: </p>
<p>apud Micham, 	In quo praeveniam Jehovam? incurvabo me Deo excelsi? num praeveniam Ipsum holocaustis, vitulis filiis anni, num complacebit Jehovah in millibus arietum, in myriadibus 
rivorum olei?... indicavit tibi, homo, quid bonum, et quid Jehovah requirens a te, tantum facere judicium, et amare misericordiam, et humiliare se, ambulando cum Deo tuo? vi 6-8. [7] Inde nunc 
patet quod sacrificia non mandata sint sed permissa, tum quod in sacrificiis nihil aliud spectatum quam internum; et quod internum fuerit, non autem externam, quod placuit; quare etiam Dominus illa 
abrogavit; sicut etiam {6} praedictum per Danielem his verbis, 	In medio septimanae cessare faciet sacrIficium et oblationem, ix 27, ubi de Adventu Domini, videantur quae de illis dicta sunt in Parte 
Prima, n. 922, (o)923, 1128, 1823.  (m)Quod attinet `filium bovis' quem Abraham pro tribus viris fecit seu paravit, similiter se habuit ac cum illo in sacrificiis; quod similia significaverit, etiam 
inde constare potest quod dixerit ad Sarah ut `acciperet tria sata similaginis'; de similagine ad unum juvencum, ita apud Mosen, 	Cum venerint in terram; cum feceris filium bovis holocaustum aut sacrificium, 
nuncupando votum, aut pacifica Jehovae, {7} offeres super filium bovis minham de similagine tres decimas mixtas oleo, Num. 8, 9; </p>
<p>ubi similiter `tria,' hic tres decimae, ibi tria sata; at vero 
ad arietem modo duae decimae, ad agnum decima {8}, ibid. (x)xv 4-6.(n) 	@1 i boves et.$ 	@2 i per.$ 	@3 nec.$ 	@4 cognitiones 1.$ 	@5 obedire.$ 	@6 quoque.$ 	@7 i et.$ 	@8 i una.$ </p>
