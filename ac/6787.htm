<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6787节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6787.</strong>出埃及记2:20-22.他对女儿们说，他在哪里？你们为什么撇下那人呢？你们去请他，让他吃饭。摩西乐意和那人同住；他就把他女儿西坡拉给了摩西。她生了一个儿子，摩西给他起名叫革舜；因为他说，我在外地作了寄居的。<br />“他对女儿们说”表关于教会神圣事物的思维。“他在哪里？你们为什么撇下那人呢”表没有那真理，他们如何与教会的良善结合呢？“你们去请他”表它必须被结合。“让他吃饭”表在良善上变得更强壮。“摩西乐意和那人同住”表他们是一致的。“他就把他女儿西坡拉给了摩西”表他把他教会的良善与它联结起来。“她生了一个儿子”表从该联结而来的真理。“摩西给他起名叫革舜”表它们的品质。“因为他说，我在外地作了寄居的”表他在一个并非他自己的教会中在真理上接受教导。</p>

Verses 20-22. And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? Why is this that ye have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread. And Moses was willing to dwell with the man; and he gave Moses Zipporah 
his daughter. And she bare a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a strange land. "And he said unto his daughters," signifies thought concerning the holy 
things of the church; "and where is he? Why is this that ye have left the man?" signifies how without that truth could they be conjoined with the good of the church; "call him," signifies that it must 
be conjoined; "that he may eat bread," signifies confirmation in good; "and Moses was willing to dwell with the man," signifies that they were in agreement; "and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter," 
signifies that he adjoined to it the good of his church; "and she bare a son," signifies truths thence; "and he called his name Gershom," signifies their quality; "for he said, I have been a sojourner 
in a strange land," signifies that he was instructed in truths in a church not his own. </p>

Verses 20-22 And he said to his daughters, And where is he? Why is it that you left the man? Call him, and let him eat bread. And Moses was willing to dwell with the man; and he gave Zipporah his daughter 
to Moses. And she bore a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, I am a stranger in a foreign land.  </p>
<p>'And he said to his daughters means thought about the holy things belonging to the 
Church. 'And where is he? Why is it that you left the man?' means, In what way without that truth could they be joined to the good of the Church? 'Call him' means that it was to be joined. 'And let 
him eat bread' means being made stronger in good. 'And Moses was willing to dwell with the man' means that they were in agreement. 'And he gave Zipporah his daughter to Moses' means that he linked the 
good of his Church to it. 'And she bore a son' means the truths from that union. 'And he called his name Gershom' means the essential nature of them. 'For he said, I am a stranger in a foreign land' 
means that he received instruction in truths in a Church that was not his own.  </p>

Vers. 20-22.  Et dixit ad filias suas, Et ubi ille? quare hoc reliquistis virum? vocate illum, et edat panem.  Et voluit Moscheh habitare cum viro, et dedit Zipporam filiam suam Moschi. Et peperit filium, 
et vocavit nomen ejus Gerschom, quia dixit, Peregrinus sum in terra aliena.  `Et dixit ad filias suas' significat cogitationem de sanctis Ecclesiae: `et ubi ille? quare hoc reliquistis virum?' 
significat quomodo absque illo vero conjungi possent bono Ecclesiae: `vocate illum' significat quod conjungendum: `et edat panem' significat confirmationem in bono: `et voluit Moscheh habitare cum viro' 
significat quod concordarent: `et dedit Zipporam filiam suam Moschi' significat quod adjunxerit ei bonum suae Ecclesiae: `et peperit filium' significat vera inde: `et vocavit nomen ejus Gerschom' significat 
quale illorum: `quia dixit, Peregrinus sum in terra aliena' significat se instructum in veris in Ecclesia non sua. </p>
