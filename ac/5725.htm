<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5725节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5725.</strong>我被恩准通过经历获知，洪水或水的泛滥在灵义上是什么意思。按灵义来理解，洪水有两个方面，一方面是恶欲的洪水，另一方面是虚假的洪水。恶欲的洪水影响心智的意愿部分和右脑；而虚假的洪水则影响与左脑相连的理解力部分。当过着良善生活的人被带回自己的自我，因而被带回他自己的生命气场时，就看似有洪水出现。当陷入这种洪水时，他就会生气、发怒，有不安的想法和野蛮的恶欲。当虚假所在的左脑被洪水淹没时，这一切以一种方式发生；当邪恶所在的右脑被洪水淹没时，这一切以另一种方式发生。<br />但当此人被保守在他通过重生从主那里得来的生命气场中时，他就完全从这种洪水中走出来，可以说处于平静安详、阳光明媚、快乐幸福的状态，从而远离生气、发怒、不安、恶欲等等。对灵人来说，这后一种状态就是早晨或春天；而前一种状态则是他们的晚上或秋天。我被引导发觉我在这种洪水之外；这洪水持续了很长时间，在此期间，我看见其他灵人被卷入其中。然而，后来我自己也被淹没了；那时我经历了感觉像洪水那样的东西。正经历试探的人就在这种洪水中。我由此获知在圣言中，“洪水”表示什么，即表示属于主的属天教会的上古之人的最后一代被完全淹没在邪恶和虚假的洪水之中，以致他们灭亡了。</p>

It has been granted me to learn by experience what an inundation or deluge is in the spiritual sense. Such an inundation is two-fold, one of cupidities, and the other of falsities. That which is of cupidities 
belongs to the will part, and is on the right side of the brain; but that which is of falsities belongs to the intellectual part, in which is the left side of the brain. When a man who has lived 
in good is remitted into his own, thus into the sphere of his own life, there then appears as it were an inundation; and when he is in this inundation he is indignant, angry, thinks restlessly, desires 
impetuously. This takes place in one way when the left side of the brain where there are falsities is inundated, and in another when the right side where evils are is inundated. But when the man 
is kept in the sphere of life which he had received from the Lord by regeneration, he is then entirely out of such an inundation, and is as it were in a serene and sunny, cheerful and happy state, thus 
far from indignation, anger, unrest, cupidities, and the like. This is the morning or springtime of spirits; the other is their evening or autumn. It was given me to perceive that I was outside this 
inundation, and this for quite a long time; while I saw that other spirits were in it. Afterward, however, I myself was immersed, and then I noticed the appearance of an inundation. In such an inundation 
are they who are in temptations. By it too I was instructed what the "flood" signifies in the Word-that the last posterity of the most ancient people, who were of the Lord's celestial church, were 
completely inundated with evils and falsities, and thus perished. </p>

Experience has enabled me to learn what is implied in the spiritual sense by a deluge or flood. Understood in this spiritual sense a deluge is two-sided, being on the one hand a deluge of evil desires, 
on the other a deluge of falsities. The deluge of evil desires affects the will part of the mind and the right side of the brain, whereas that of falsities affects the understanding part, with which 
the left side of the brain is connected. When a person who has led a good life is taken back into his own selfhood, and so into the sphere that emanates from the life properly his own, it seems like 
a deluge. Caught in this deluge he is annoyed and angry, has unpeaceful thoughts and wildly evil desires. It is one thing when the left side of the brain, where falsities exist, is under deluge, another 
when the right, where evils reside, is under it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But when a person is kept within the sphere emanating from the life he has received through regeneration from the Lord he is completely outside 
such a deluge. He is so to speak in a calm and sunny, cheerful and happy place, and so is far removed from annoyance, anger, unpeacefulness, evil desires, and the like. The latter state is for spirits 
morning or spring, the former state their evening or autumn. I was led to perceive myself outside such a deluge; this lasted quite a long time, during which I saw other spirits caught in it. But 
after that I too become submerged in it, when I experienced what felt like a deluge. This is the kind in which people undergoing temptations are caught. From this I learned what is meant in the Word by 
the Flood, namely that the final descendants of the most ancient people who belonged to the Lord's celestial Church were completely submerged in evils and falsities, so that they perished. </p>

Ab experientia discere datum est quid inundatio seu diluvium in sensu spirituali; inundatio illa est duplex, una quae est cupiditatum, et altera quae est falsitatum; quae est cupiditatum, est partis 
voluntariae, et est dextrae partis cerebri, at quae est falsitatum, est partis intellectualis, {1}in qua est sinistra pars cerebri.  Cum remittitur homo qui in bono vixerat, in proprium suum, ita in 
sphaeram suaemet vitae, tunc apparet quasi inundatio; cum in illa inundatione est, tunc indignatur, irascitur, cogitat irrequiete, cupit vehementer; aliter cum inundatur sinistra pars cerebri, ubi sunt 
falsa, et aliter cum dextra ubi {2}mala.  Cum autem homo tenetur in sphaera vitae quam receperat a Domino {3}per regenerationem, tunc prorsus extra talem inundationem est, et est quasi in sereno et 
aprico, {4}et in laeto et felici, ita longe ab indignatione, ira, {5}irrequietudine, cupiditatibus et similibus; hoc est mane seu ver spirituum, illud est vespera seu autumnus eorum.  Datum erat mihi 
percipere quod extra inundationem essem, et hoc satis diu, cum viderem quod alii spiritus essent in illa; postea autem ipse immersus fui, et tunc {6}appercepi similitudinem inundationis.  In tali sunt 
qui in tentationibus. Inde quoque instructus sum quid diluvium in Verbo significat, quod nempe ultima posteritas antiquissimorum qui fuerunt ab Ecclesia caelesti Domini, prorsus inundati fuerint malis 
et falsis et sic perierint. @1 ad hanc pars sinistra cerebri pertinet, ad illam autem pars cerebri dextra$ @2 i sunt$ @3 cum regeneratus est$ @4 inque$ @5 inquietudinibus$ @6 percepi$ </p>
