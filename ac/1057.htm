<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1057.</strong>创世记9:17 神对挪亚说，这是立约的记号，是我在我与地上一切有血肉的之间所立的。<br />“神对挪亚说”表教会会知道这一切。“这是立约的记号，是我在我与地上一切有血肉的之间所立的”表这是主在仁爱中不仅与教会成员同在，还与教会外的人同在的标志。</p>

And God said to Noah, "This is the sign of the pact that I am setting up between me and all flesh that is on the earth."<br />God said to Noah means the church would know the following. This is the sign of the pact that I am setting up between me and all flesh that is on the earth means that not only would people in the church have an indication that the Lord was present in charity but people outside the church would too. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1057</b></p><p><b>1057.</b>
Verse 17. And God said unto Noah, This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is upon the earth. "And God said unto Noah" signifies that the church should 
know this; "this is the sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is upon the earth" signifies that the indication of the presence of the Lord in charity was not only 
with the man of the church, but also with the man who is outside the church. </p>

Verse 17 And God said to Noah, This is the sign of the covenant which I am establishing between Me and all flesh that is on the earth. </p>
<p>'God said to Noah' means that the Church would know this. 'This 
is the sign of the covenant which I am establishing between Me and all flesh that is on the earth' means that it was a token of the Lord's presence in charity not only with the member of the Church 
but also with him who is outside the Church. </p>

</p><b>1057.</b>
Vers. 17. Et dixit Deus ad Noahum, Hoc signum foederis quod erigo inter Me, et inter omnem carnem, quae super terra. 'Dixit Deus ad Noahum' significat quod hoc sciret Ecclesia: 'hoc signum foederis 
quod erigo inter Me, et inter omnem carnem, quae super terra' significat quod indicium praesentiae Domini in charitate non solum esset apud hominem Ecclesiae sed etiam apud hominem extra Ecclesiam. </p>
