<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7743节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7743.</strong>前面提到，火星居民处于属天之爱。他们就是因颜色变化而发出美丽闪光的火焰，以及颜色相似的鸟儿所代表的人。如今，他们当中有许多人开始离开这属天之爱，唯独喜欢知识，并以为天上的生命唯独在于这种知识；这一事实由变成石头的鸟来代表。因为鸟表示属灵生命；它变成石头表示没有爱的知识的生命，这种生命不再是属灵的生命，而是像石头一样冰冷的生命，来自天堂的东西无法流入这样的生命。他们仍以为自己在主里面，和那里那些处于属天之爱的生命之人一样；这一点由起来想夺走这鸟的灵人来表示并演示。<br />7743a.石鸟还代表以一种奇怪的方式使其思维和情感的生命变得几乎没有生命的火星居民；对此，我所看见并听见的如下。</p>

That the inhabitants of Mars are in celestial love, has been already told. They are represented by an appearance of flame, glittering beautifully with variegations of color, and also by a bird of similar 
coloring. That some at this day are beginning to withdraw from this celestial love, and solely to love knowledges, and to make celestial life consist in these alone, was represented by that bird 
changed into stone; for by a bird is signified spiritual life; and by its being turned into stone is signified the life of knowledges without love, which is no longer spiritual life, but a life cold as 
stone, into which nothing from heaven flows. And their still believing that they are in the Lord, like those who are in the life of celestial love there, was signified and shown by the spirit who rose 
up and wished to take away the bird. </p>
<p>7743a. By the bird of stone were also represented inhabitants of that earth who change the life of their thoughts and affections by a strange method into almost 
no life; as to which I have seen and heard what now follows. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7743</b></p><p><b>7743.</b>
It has been mentioned already that the inhabitants of Mars are governed by celestial love. They are the ones who were represented by the flaming object that acquired a beautiful sparkle from variations 
in its colour, and also by the bird with similar colourings. The fact that at the present day a large number of them are beginning to depart from that celestial love, to love knowledge alone, and to 
suppose that heavenly life lies solely in such knowledge, was represented by the bird when it had turned to stone. For the bird means spiritual life, and its being turned into stone means a life of 
knowledge but no love, which is not spiritual life any longer but a life cold as stone which nothing from heaven can enter. And their continuing to believe that the Lord is with them, as He is with those 
there whose lives are governed by celestial love, was meant and demonstrated by the spirit who rose up from below and wished to take the bird away. </p>
<p><a href="7743.htm">7743</a>a The bird of stone was also a representation 
of inhabitants of that planet who use a strange method to transform the life of their thoughts and affections into a virtual absence of life. What I have seen and heard about this follows below. </p>

Quod incolae Martis in caelesti amore sint, prius memoratum est; illi sunt {1}repraesentati per flammeum colorum variegationibus pulchre coruscum, et quoque per avem similium colorificationum; quod 
plures hodie incipiant recedere a caelesti illo amore, et solum amare cognitiones, ac in illis solis ponere caelestem vitam, {2}repraesentatum est per avem illam mutatam in lapideam; per avem enim significatur 
vita spiritualis; per quod versa in lapideam, significatur vita cognitionum absque amore, quae non vita spiritualis amplius est, sed vita frigida sicut lapidea, in quam non aliquid e caelo influit; 
et quod usque credant quod in Domino sint, sicut illi ibi qui in caelestis amoris vita sunt, significatum et ostensum est per spiritum qui assurgebat et auferre volebat avem. 	@1 qui repraesentati 
sunt per flammeum pulchris colorum variegationibus coruscum$ 	@2 repraesentati sunt$ </p>
<p>7743a.  Per avem lapideam etiam repraesentati sunt incolae illius telluris qui vitam cogitationum et affectionum 
suarum peregrino modo transmutant in paene nullam vitam; de qua re sequentia vidi et audivi. </p>
